1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Sanofi Pasteur submitted on 29 March 2022 an application for marketing authorisation to 
the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Vidprevtyn Beta, through the centralised procedure falling 
within the Article 3(1) and point 1 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. 
During the procedure, the applicant changed the application from VidPrevtyn to VidPrevtyn Beta (see 
below). The applicant applied initially for VidPrevtyn (Wuhan strain) for the following indication: 
10 µg primary series 
“Vidprevtyn is indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, in 
individuals 18 through 59 years of age. 
The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations.” 
5 µg booster 
“Vidprevtyn is indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, in 
individuals 18 years of age and older previously vaccinated against COVID-19. 
The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations.” 
During the procedure, the applicant changed the application from VidPrevtyn to VidPrevtyn Beta (Beta 
strain, 5 µg booster). For VidPrevtyn Beta, the applicant applied for the following indication: 
“VidPrevtyn Beta is indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV- 2, in 
individuals 18 years of age and older previously vaccinated against COVID-19. 
The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations.” 
The applicant’s strategy was initially to seek a marketing authorisation for VidPrevtyn (Wuhan based) 
as a vaccine to be used for primary series and as a booster, then followed by the addition of the beta 
variant booster vaccine (VidPrevtyn Beta). In view of the epidemiological evolution and needs to 
support the choice of a booster with broad protection against Variants of Concern (including Omicron) 
for a population already primed, the application was updated to seek only a marketing authorisation 
for VidPrevtyn Beta. 
1.2.  Legal basis, dossier content 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain tests or studies. 
1.3.  Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0201/2021 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
Assessment report

Page 7/185 
 
 
 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0046/2022 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
1.4.  Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
1.4.1.  Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indication. 
1.5.  Applicant’s request(s) for consideration 
1.5.1.  New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance SARS-CoV-2 prefusion Spike delta TM protein, 
recombinant (B.1.351 strain) contained in the above medicinal product to be considered as a new 
active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously 
authorised within the European Union. 
1.6.  Scientific advice 
The applicant received the following Scientific advice on the development in the context of the present 
application:

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
In December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) was informed about a cluster of cases of 
viral pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan, China. In mid-January 2020, the pathogen causing this 
atypical pneumonia was identified as a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) and genome sequence data were published. Since then, the virus has spread globally. 
On 30 January 2020 the WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International 
Concern and on 11 March 2020 a pandemic. The pandemic is ongoing despite unprecedented efforts to 
control the outbreak. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors 
As of 7 November 2022, there have been over 629 million confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection 
globally with approximately 6.58 million deaths resulting from infection and subsequent coronavirus 
disease (COVID-19) as registered by WHO (https://covid19.who.int/). The majority of infections result 
in asymptomatic or mild disease with full recovery.   
Underlying health conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic 
respiratory disease, chronic kidney disease, immune compromised status, cancer and obesity are 
considered risk factors for developing severe COVID-19. Other risk factors include organ 
transplantation and chromosomal abnormalities. Increasing age is another risk factor for severe 
disease and death due to COVID-19. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) virus, with a single linear RNA 
segment. It is enveloped and the virions are 50–200 nanometres in diameter. Like other 
coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has four structural proteins, known as the S (spike), E (envelope), M 
(membrane), and N (nucleocapsid) proteins.  
The spike protein contains a polybasic cleavage site, a characteristic known to increase pathogenicity 
and transmissibility in other viruses. The Spike is responsible for allowing the virus to attach to and 
fuse with the membrane of a host cell. The S1 subunit catalyses attachment to the angiotensin 
converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor present on cells of the respiratory tract, while the S2 subunit 
facilitates fusion with the cell membrane. The spike protein is considered a relevant antigen for vaccine 
development because it was shown that antibodies directed against it neutralise the virus and it elicits 
an immune response that prevents infection in animals. 
It is believed that SARS-CoV-2 has zoonotic origins and it has close genetic similarity to bat 
coronaviruses. Its gene sequence was published mid-January 2020 and the virus belongs to the beta-
coronaviruses. 
As for all viruses, the SARS-CoV-2 virus will constantly change through mutation and, indeed, many 
variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with different sets of mutations have been observed worldwide. 
While most emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants will not have a significant impact on the spread of the 
virus, some mutations or combinations of mutations may provide the virus with a selective advantage,

such as increased transmissibility or the ability to evade the host immune response. These variants 
could increase the risk posed by SARS-CoV-2 to human health and are considered variants of concern 
(VoC). End of 2020, one year after the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan ancestral strain late 2019, 
various variants of concern (VOC) were identified, including Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma 
(B.1.1.28). In spring 2021, Delta (B.1.617.2) became the dominant variant worldwide, and end of 
2021, Omicron BA.1 replaced Delta. Currently BA.5 is dominating in the EU. 
According to European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), histologic findings from the 
lungs include diffuse alveolar damage similar to lung injury caused by other respiratory viruses, such 
as MERS-CoV and influenza virus. A distinctive characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 infection is vascular 
damage, with severe endothelial injury, widespread thrombosis, microangiopathy and angiogenesis. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
Human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed in January 2020. Transmission occurs 
primarily via respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes and through aerosols. The median 
incubation period after infection to the development of symptoms is four to five days. Most 
symptomatic individuals experience symptoms within two to seven days after exposure, and almost all 
symptomatic individuals will experience one or more symptoms before day twelve. Common symptoms 
include fever, cough, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste and symptoms may 
change over time.  
The major complication of severe COVID-19 is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) presenting 
with dyspnoea and acute respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation. In addition to 
respiratory sequelae, severe COVID-19 has been linked to cardiovascular sequelae, such as myocardial 
injury, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy and heart failure, acute kidney injury often requiring renal 
replacement therapy, neurological complications such as encephalopathy, and acute ischemic stroke. 
The severity of COVID-19 disease varies. The disease may take a mild course with few or no 
symptoms, resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold. Mild cases 
typically recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical disease may take three to six 
weeks to recover. Among those who have died, the time from symptom onset to death has ranged 
from two to eight weeks.  
Studies among hospitalised patients have found that high SARS-CoV-2 viral load is associated with 
worse outcomes, including increased mortality rates (Magleby, 2020) (Westblade, 2020). Community-
based studies in non-hospitalised patients show symptomatic patients have higher viral load across 
both adults and children compared to asymptomatic individuals (Chung, 2021). 
The gold standard method of testing for presence of SARS-CoV-2 is the reverse transcription 
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which detects the presence of viral RNA fragments. As this test 
detects RNA but not infectious virus, its ability to determine duration of infectivity of patients is limited. 
The test is typically done on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab, a nasal swab or 
sputum sample. 
2.1.5.  Management 
The management of COVID-19 cases has developed since the start of the pandemic, and includes 
supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and supporting other affected vital 
organs.  
Assessment report  
EMA/893684/2022  
Page 13/185 
 
 
 
Treatment of hospitalised patients encompass anti-inflammatory agents such as dexamethasone, 
targeted immunomodulatory agents and anticoagulants as well as antiviral therapy such as Veklury 
(remdesivir, EMEA/H/C/005622) or Paxlovid, that can be used in the outpatient setting (PF-
07321332/ritonavir, EMEA/H/C/005973).  
Monoclonal antibodies and notably bi-therapies to overcome potential escape by VOC with mutations 
on spike are perceived as of potential value. This was particularly true for immunocompromised 
individuals especially where vaccines might not induce adequate immune response in those patients of 
particular medical need. Thus, recently, four monoclonal antibodies Ronapreve 
(casirivimab/imdevimab, EMEA/H/C/005814), Regkirona (regdanvimab, EMEA/H/C/005854), Xevudy 
(sotrovimab, EMEA/H/C/005676) and Evusheld (tixagevimab /cilgavimab, EMEA/H/C/005788) have 
been authorised for the treatment of COVID-19 disease in individuals who do not require supplemental 
oxygen and who are at increased risk of their disease becoming severe. In the case of Ronapreve, it is 
also authorised for prevention of COVID-19, and Evusheld also for pre-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-
19. 
Other products have been repurposed to be used for the treatment of COVID-19, such as Kineret 
(anakinra, EMEA/H/C/000363) in adult patients with pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen (low- 
or high-flow oxygen) who are at risk of progressing to severe respiratory failure determined by plasma 
concentration of soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR)≥6 ng/ml; and RoActemra 
(tocilizumab, EMEA/H/C/000955) in adults who are receiving systemic corticosteroids and require 
supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation. 
Additionally, there are 6 approved vaccines for active immunisation against SARS-CoV-2 aiming to 
prevent COVID-19 disease: Comirnaty (EMEA/H/C/005735), Spikevax (EMEA/H/C/005791), Vaxzevria 
(EMEA/H/C/005675), Jcovden (EMEA/H/C/005737), Nuvaxovid (EMEA/H/C/005808) and COVID-19 
Vaccine (inactivated, adjuvanted) Valneva (EMEA/H/C/006019). The mRNA vaccine include in their 
marketing authorisation adapted Omicron vaccines. 
2.2.  About the product 
VidPrevtyn Beta vaccine (SARS-CoV-2 prefusion Spike delta TM recombinant protein vaccine candidate 
from the strain B.1.351 and adjuvanted with AS03) is intended as a booster for the active 
immunization to prevent COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2), in individuals 18 years of age and older previously vaccinated against COVID-19. A 
single injection of 5 μg dosage of the vaccine is intended to be used. The vaccine contains a version of 
the spike protein found on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 Beta variant. 
The adjuvant AS03 is an oil-in-water emulsion containing squalene and α tocopherol. This adjuvant 
may enhance the quality and quantity of the immune response by promoting a more balanced T-helper 
(Th)1/Th2 response. The combination of antigen and adjuvant enhances the magnitude of immune 
response, which may contribute to protection against COVID-19. 
A booster dose of VidPrevtyn Beta is administered intramuscularly. It is recommended to administer 
VidPrevtyn Beta at least 4 months after the completion of primary vaccination with authorised COVID-
19 vaccine.

Sodium chloride, Polysorbate 20, Water for injections, 
•  Adjuvant vial: Sodium chloride, Disodium hydrogen phosphate, Potassium dihydrogen 
phosphate, Potassium chloride, Water for injections. 
The product is available as one pack containing: 
•  2.5 mL antigen solution in a multidose vial (type 1 glass) with a stopper (chlorobutyl) and an 
aluminium seal with a green plastic flip-off cap  
•  2.5 mL adjuvant emulsion in a multidose vial (type 1 glass) with a stopper (chlorobutyl) and an 
aluminium seal with a yellow plastic flip-off cap. 
The volume after mixing 1 vial of solution (2.5 mL) with 1 vial of emulsion (2.5 mL) corresponds to 10 
doses of vaccine (5 mL). 
2.3.2.  Active substance 
2.3.2.1.  General information 
The active substance, CoV2 preS dTM (B.1.351) contains the recombinant SARS-CoV2 prefusion Spike 
deleted (also referred as delta or d)-transmembrane protein whose sequence is based on the South 
African variant (B.1.351; GISAID Accession EPI_ISL_1048524) as the COVID-19 vaccine antigen.  
The gene sequence was derived by modifying the gene encoding the CoV2 preS dTM (D614) protein, 
which was an earlier vaccine candidate with a sequence based on the native genome isolate Wuhan-
Hu-1. Additional modifications were made to the native SARS-CoV2 S protein gene coding (GenBank 
Accession NC045512) to enable the expression and secretion of the prefusion-stabilized soluble S 
protein of the beta variant from strain B.1.351, as trimer. This protein is expressed in expresSF+ 
(Lepidopteran) insect cell line using a baculovirus expression vector.  
These modifications include: i) the substitution of the native S protein secretion signal peptide with a 
baculovirus specific secretion signal peptide, ii) amino acid substitutions at the polybasic protease 
cleavage site to prevent S1-S2 subunit cleavage and maintain the spike protein in a pre-fusion state, 
iii) adding two stabilizing proline mutations in the S2 fusion region (2), iv) removal of the C-terminal

transmembrane domain and adjacent cytoplasmic domain to enable secretion from the expressing cell, 
and v) addition of a T4 bacteriophage fibritin foldon domain to the C-terminus to enable S protein 
trimerization in the absence of the transmembrane domain.  
The active substance of the recombinant CoV2 preS dTM (B.1.351) protein has a purity higher than 
90% and to have a molecular mass of approximately 170 kDa. 
2.3.2.2.  Manufacture, process controls and characterisation 
Manufacturers 
The active substance is manufactured at two different sites (Genzyme Corporation, Framingham, USA 
and Sanofi-Chimie, Vitry, France). Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) compliance has been 
documented for sites involved.  
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The manufacture of the CoV2 preS dTM active substance is divided into Upstream Process (USP) and 
Downstream Process (DSP).  
The  Upstream  Process  for  production  of  the  CoV2  preS  dTM  active  substance  includes  expansion  of 
expresSF+ (SF+) cells from Working Cell Bank (WCB),expansion of the Working Virus Bank (WVB) to 
Working Virus Stocks (WVS) and infection of SF+ cells with WVS allowing the production of the CoV2 
preS dTM protein in the production bioreactor.  
The Downstream Process for purification of the CoV2 preS dTM active substance includes a clarification 
step  followed  by  several  chromatography  steps  to  further  purify  the  CoV2  preS  dTM  protein  and 
contribute to viral clearance. An ultrafiltration / diafiltration step is used to concentrate the CoV2 preS 
dTM  protein.  Additionally,  a  detergent  treatment  contributes  to  viral  clearance  and  a  filtration  step 
ensures a low bioburden content.   
The CoV2 preS dTM active substance manufacturing process does not include reprocessing. The 
manufacturing process has been sufficiently described and it is similar between the two active 
substance manufacturing sites. The batch numbering system has been described in the dossier.  
Control of materials 
Cell banks 
The source, history and generation of the expresSF+ cell line is described in sufficient detail. The 
applicant is using a two-tiered cell bank system. The master cell bank (MCB) and the two working cell 
banks (WCB) lots derived thereof have been characterised in line with ICH Q5D requirements. Cell 
banks have been sufficiently qualified using an adequate testing panel which is in line with Ph. Eur. 
5.2.3.  
Virus Banks 
The baculovirus strain used for recombinant protein manufacturing is Autographa californica nuclear 
polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV), which is the prototype virus of the Baculoviridae family and was originally 
isolated from a single field collected alfalfa looper larva. Generation of the parental linear baculovirus 
master bank has been described. The generation of the parental transfer vector has been sufficiently 
described. The choice of the transgene sequence and the cloning of the CoV2 preS dTM gene into the 
parental transfer vector has been sufficiently described.  
Assessment report  
EMA/893684/2022  
Page 16/185 
 
 
 
 
The master virus bank (MVB) has been adequately qualified. The master virus bank without the gene 
encoding the active substance is used to generate a working virus bank (WVB) containing the gene. 
The cloning strategy is described in sufficient detail. The qualification tests and acceptance criteria 
have been described and batch analysis results have been provided to ensure identity, titer, sterility, 
viral safety and correct assembly of the WVB.  
Raw materials  
Both, compendial and non-compendial raw materials have been listed by the applicant. Compendial 
materials are proposed to be tested against the relevant Ph. Eur. specifications, whereas non-
compendial materials are proposed to be tested against in-house specifications. Data has been 
presented to give reassurance on viral/ Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) safety. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
During the manufacture of the active substance, process parameters (PPs) and  in-process tests (IPTs) 
and specification / release tests have been implemented to ensure that the manufacturing process 
steps remain under control and meet their operating range and specifications. The defined PPs and 
IPTs has been justified.  There are no intermediates in the manufacturing process.  
Process Validation 
Process validation/process performance qualification (PPQ) has been performed for both active 
substance manufacturing sites individually. The applicant’s approach of performing a continuous 
process verification (CPV) for B.1.351 at the sites that have already performed PPQ for D614 has been 
agreed during scientific advice procedures for this product. 
The PPQ campaign with the D614 strain has been performed at Framingham and Vitry using three 
consistency lots, respectively. The Initial Process Verification (IPV) studies for the B.1.351 strain was 
conducted after the initial  PPQ and consisted of three consistency lots at each manufacturing site 
(Framingham, USA and Vitry, France). Release test results have been provided and all results met the 
respective acceptance criteria, which is also applicable to the PPs investigated. Process hold time 
investigations; resin lifetime studies and microbial control studies have been provided. Small scale 
resin lifetime studies were performed with the D614 strain. At scale resin lifetime continuous process 
verification report studies for B.1.351 process batches will be provided by Q1 2023 (Recommendation 
1). In addition, a transport validation report for the active substance should be provided 
(Recommendation 7).  
Manufacturing process development 
The present B.1.351 strain application is based on the initial development of the applicant’s D614 
vaccine candidate. Therefore, most of the manufacturing process development is based on the D614 
vaccine development. When designing the B.1.351 active substance manufacturing process, process 
adjustments compared to D614 strain have been limited to the strict minimum to adapt to the new 
strain characteristics. Consequently, the additional manufacturing process development and industrial 
work for the implementation of the B.1.351 active substance strain has been leveraging significantly 
the D614 prior knowledge and qualification/validation. 
The development of the specifications has been sufficiently described. Some critical tests have been 
changed during the clinical development, but the evolution of these tests has been adequately 
described and justified. 
Assessment report  
EMA/893684/2022  
Page 17/185 
 
 
 
Manufacturing process development from phase I/II over phase II to phase III/commercial has been 
sufficiently described and changes are justified. Major changes have been introduced in the 
manufacturing process from Phase I/II to Phase II in order to improve the purity. Therefore, 
differences found in the characterisation comparability are expected. Comparability data demonstrate 
that the Spike Protein is folded correctly in all active substance vaccine preparations and the antigen 
used in clinical Phase I/II and Phase II process demonstrated physical and antigenic characteristics as 
expected. Comparability analyses between phase II and phase III/commercial batches demonstrate 
good comparability. 
A comparability evaluation has been performed to demonstrate comparability between clinical batches 
manufactured at the clinical manufacturing site and each of the two commercial active substance 
manufacturing sites Framingham and Vitry. The comparability approach is acceptable, and the choice 
of characterization tests is endorsed. The comparability analysis demonstrates for both commercial 
active substance manufacturing sites that characterization and release test results are consistent 
within three PPQ batches. These differences have been assessed and the comparability exercise as a 
whole is considered acceptable. The applicant committed to implement final active substance (B.1.351) 
process monitoring limits when data for a minimum of 30 batches are available at each manufacturing 
site (Recommendation 3). 
Additionally, a process comparison between the initial D614 spike protein and the B.1.351 spike 
protein has been presented and the impact has been evaluated. In general, the same process control 
strategy in terms of PPs, IPTs and release tests is applied for both D614 and B.1.351. Following the 
procedure for the D614 strain, a comparability assessment was performed with three commercial 
B.1.351 active substance batches manufactured at each site. However, no comparability between the 
D614 and the B.1.351 strains has been conducted as the characterization features are strain specific, 
which makes a comparison difficult. 
There are some characteristics identified, which are specific to the B.1.351 S protein and were not 
observed for the initial D614 Spike protein, i.e. maturation of the protein and conformational changes. 
The maturation phenomenon has been characterised intensively and results have been presented for 
the three sites. In summary, the applicant concluded that the maturation phenomenon has no impact 
on product quality.  
Characterisation 
The active substance has been sufficiently characterised by physicochemical and biological state-of-
the-art methods revealing that the active substance has the expected structure of CoV2 preS dTM 
B.1.351.  
Phase III/commercial process CoV2 preS dTM B.1.351 active substance batches have been used for 
characterization. The overall characterisation approach remains the same as for D614, though new 
data for B.1.351 is provided. The active substance has been characterised using glycopeptide mapping, 
disulfide bond mapping, thermal analysis and Infrared Spectroscopy to analyse secondary structures. 
Besides that, additional characterization tests to assess HCP (host cell protein) identity, purity, potency 
and biological activity have been provided. Overall, the results for B.1.351 are similar to the results for 
D614 and are consistent with the proposed structure. In summary, the provided information on 
characterization is deemed sufficient and considered acceptable.   
Potential process-related and product-related impurities have been discussed and have been shown to 
be reduced to acceptable levels by the manufacturing process. Additionally, the applicant commits to 
provide additional data regarding impurity clearance by end of Q4 2022 (Recommendation 2). So far, 
no protein aggregates have been observed.

2.3.2.3.  Specification 
Release tests include tests performed at the active substance and tests performed at other stages (pre-
harvest  or  pre-infection).  Overall,  release  tests  have  been  chosen  adequately.  The  active  substance 
specifications  include  physico-chemical  and  safety  tests,  adventitious  agents  tests,  Identity,  Potency, 
Protein content, Potency to total protein content ratio and process-related impurities tests.  
Analytical methods 
All methods have been described in the dossier. Method validation has been described for all non-
compendial methods and for the different active substance sites separately.  
Batch analysis 
B.1.351 Batch data from three Initial Process Verification (IPV) batches manufactured at the 
Framingham and the Vitry site have been provided. In addition, batch analysis data from the clinical 
manufacturing site are included in the dossier. All results for the batches manufactured at the three 
sites are consistent and within the specifications.   
Justification of specifications 
The proposed active substance acceptance criteria have been justified in detail. Overall, the 
justifications are considered sufficient. During the procedure, questions have been raised regarding the 
release specifications. Some specifications have been amended, further justified or included as an 
additional release test as requested. The Relative Antigen Content determination will only be 
performed in stability studies. The applicant committed to implement limits when further real-time 
stability data are available from at least three commercial batches from each active substance site 
(Recommendation 5). The applicant is requested to revise the ‘Potency to total protein content ratio’ 
specification when data from 30 B.1.351 batches are available (Recommendation 6). Impurities have 
been studied in nonclinical and clinical studies as relevant. 
Reference materials 
Two representative lots of frozen CoV2 preS dTM material for variant B.1.351 were qualified for use as 
reference standard and positive control in potency and/or identity tests. The reference standard has 
been qualified and stability has been addressed. The new B.1.351 reference standard lots are the same 
for active substance and finished product. 
Container-Closure system 
Single-use bags are used for storage and transport of the active substance. The bags are received from 
the supplier pre-sterilized via gamma irradiation. The bags comply with Ph. Eur. requirements and are 
therefore deemed suitable for the intended use.  
Both leachable and extractable studies have been performed, showing the suitability of the container 
closure system of the active substance for up to 6 months. The applicant committed to perform a new 
small-scale leachable study, which should support the intended storage of the B.1.351 active 
substance (Recommendation 4).

2.3.2.4.  Stability 
Active substance (B.1.351) stability data have been provided for three manufacturing sites (clinical 
manufacturing site, Framingham and Vitry) for three batches each. Stability has been analysed at the 
intended storage conditions and under accelerated conditions. For all batches manufactured at the 
different sites data are available. In the course of the current procedure, the applicant has revised the 
acceptance criterion applied in stability studies. The accelerated conditions show a decrease of the 
potency over time. However, they were still within the specification applied for the long-term storage 
conditions. 
The determination of the Relative Antigen Content is a newly introduced method. The applicant 
committed to implement limits when further real-time stability data is available from at least three 
commercial batches from each active substance site (Recommendation 5). 
Stability data at long term conditions and accelerated conditions from the batches of the clinical site 
were used to build a kinetic model. The kinetic model allows for an extrapolation of shelf life for the 
active substance. The applicant committed to immediately report any results of the on-going stability 
studies that may imply a significant risk to not comply with the end of shelf-life specification. The 
stability data and supportive kinetic stability model supports the active substance shelf life at the 
storage conditions.  
2.3.3.  Finished medicinal product 
2.3.3.1.  Description of the finished product and Pharmaceutical development 
The CoV2 preS dTM (B.1.351) finished product is composed of a modified recombinant SARS-CoV-2 
prefusion Spike delta TM protein as the COVID-19 vaccine antigen. The recombinant CoV2 preS dTM 
(B.1.351) protein is formulated in phosphate buffered saline with polysorbate 20 without preservatives 
or antibiotics. The CoV2 preS dTM finished product (B.1.351) is supplied in multi-dose vials. One dose 
of finished product (non adjuvanted) corresponds to 0.25 mL.  
The non-adjuvanted finished product is a sterile, colourless clear liquid solution to be mixed with 
adjuvant AS03 (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals) for intramuscular injection. The primary container closure 
system used for the CoV2 preS dTM (B.1.351) finished product consists of a multi-dose glass vial, a 
rubber stopper and an aluminium seal with a plastic flip-off cap. The finished product composition 
includes the following ingredients: the active substance, sodium dihydrogen phosphate monohydrate, 
disodium phosphate dodecahydrate, sodium chloride, polysorbate 20 and water for injections. 
The adjuvant AS03 (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals) is already authorised in various vaccine products 
(e.g. Adjupanrix) and therefore assessed as known excipients. The adjuvant composition includes 
squalene, D,L-α-tocopherol, polysorbate 80, sodium chloride, disodium hydrogen phosphate, 
potassium dihydrogen phosphate, potassium chloride and water for injections. The liquid AS03 
formulation is filled in glass vials, sealed with rubber stoppers for liquid formulations and secured with 
flip-off caps. 
The CoV2 preS dTM (B.1.351) active substance consists of a recombinant SARS-CoV2 Spike (S) protein 
manufactured by recombinant DNA technology in a qualified expresSF+ (Lepidopteran) insect cell line 
using baculovirus expression system technology and it is compatible with the excipients, i.e. sodium 
phosphate, sodium chloride and polysorbate 20. Sodium phosphate is included in the CoV2 preS dTM 
finished product formulation as a buffer. Sodium chloride is added to maintain osmolality of the 
finished product. Polysorbate 20 is included in the formulation as a stabilizer.

Several formulations have been developed and used in clinical studies during vaccine development, 
including D614 strain monovalent formulations, B.1.351 strain monovalent formulations and D614 
strain/B.1.351 strain bivalent formulations.  
During clinical development three different targeted amounts of CoV2 preS dTM (D614) active 
substance were investigated, i.e. either 5 μg, 10 µg or 15 μg of the antigen per dose. One multi-stage 
Phase III efficacy study was initiated to support the formulation intended for commercial production of 
CoV2 preS dTM (D614) non-adjuvanted finished product priming dose (10 µg). In parallel, a booster 
study was initiated to support the formulation intended for commercial production of CoV2 preS dTM 
(D614) non-adjuvanted finished product booster dose (5 µg) to assess the ability of the vaccine to 
generate a booster response regardless of the initial primary vaccine platform received. 
Two formulations containing CoV2 preS dTM (B.1.351) were prepared with targeted amounts of 2.5 μg 
and 5 μg of the antigen per dose and were implemented for the clinical study to assess the ability of 
the vaccine to generate a booster response regardless of the initial primary vaccine platform. The 
same manufacturing process was used as for the D614 DP phase III clinical batches. 
Sanofi Pasteur has also developed two bivalent formulations, a 2.5 μg (D614) + 2.5 μg (B.1.351) per 
dose bivalent formulation and a 5 μg (D614) + 5 μg (B.1.351) per dose bivalent formulation, to be 
used in several clinical studies.  
Total protein content has been used to formulate the clinical materials and will be used to formulate 
the commercial vaccine.  
The commercial presentation is a 5 μg/dose CoV2 preS dTM (B.1.351) booster monovalent vaccine. 
The B.1.351 strain formulation has fully leveraged development work previously conducted with the 
D614 strain. Except for the strain change, the formulation and the filling processes remain the same as 
for the D614 booster vaccine. The D614 vaccines are not in scope of this marketing authorization but 
data generated during formulation development and manufacturing development are considered 
supportive for the B.1.351 strain booster vaccine marketing authorization application.  
With regards to the commercial supply needs, the manufacturing process has been transferred from 
clinical manufacturing site to Sanofi S.r.l Anagni site (Italy), associated with scale-up. At the finished 
product stage, the manufacturing process consists of active substance formulation and filling into vials.  
A comparability study was performed to demonstrate that the transfer and scale up of the CoV2 preS 
dTM finished product formulation and filling processes do not adversely affect the CoV2 preS dTM 
finished product in terms of Quality, Safety and Efficacy. Initially the presented data was not 
considered sufficient to conclude on comparability between the clinical manufacturing site and Anagni 
(major objection). To resolve the major objection, the applicant presented an  updated comparability 
analysis, for the D614 variant, including Equivalence Testing of both sites, which confirmed the 
comparability of the two finished product manufacturing sites. To strengthen the original comparability 
study, the applicant will provide the final report of the comparability assessment including the final 
D614 stability data by Q2 2023 (Recommendation 8). Final finished product process monitoring limits 
will be implemented when data for a minimum of 30 B.1.351 batches are available at the Anagni site, 
by Q2 2023 (Recommendation 9). 
An in-use stability study was performed with the purpose of providing data to assess the in-use shelf-
life for the mix and shoot formulation of CoV2 preS dTM finished product when combined with AS03. 
Review of the study results demonstrates consistency from the initial mixing stage at T0 through the 
final testing time points. After mixing, the vaccine should be administered immediately or stored at 
2 °C to 8 °C, protected from light, and used within 6 hours as reflected in the SmPC.

2.3.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Finished product is manufactured, tested and released at Sanofi S.r.l. Anagni, Italy. Batch release will 
be  performed  by  Sanofi  Pasteur,  Marcy  l’Etoile,  France.  Compliance  with  GMP  has  been  appropriately 
documented for all sites. 
Manufacture of CoV2 preS dTM (B.1.351) finished product described in eCTD is based on supportive 
data generated with the previously developed manufacturing process of CoV2 preS dTM (D614) 
finished product. 
Production  of  the  Final  Bulk  Product  involves  combining  CoV2  preS  dTM  active  substance  with  the 
formulation  buffer  and  blending.  Pooling  of  active  substance  batches  has  been  conducted  and  will  be 
applied to the commercial processes. Final Bulk Product is filtered to reduce the bioburden, followed by 
sterilizing filtration, vial filling, stopper insertion and capping. There is no intermediate in the CoV2 preS 
dTM  finished  product  manufacturing  process.  The  finished  product  batch numbering  system has  been 
described. 
The manufacturing process, process parameters and in-process tests have been described in sufficient 
detail.  
Validation studies were performed to assess the mixing at Final Bulk Product stage, the sterile filtration 
and vial filling steps at Filled Product stage. The sterility assurance of the aseptic processing conditions 
is demonstrated during Aseptic Process Simulations. 
It is considered that sufficient information is provided for authorisation and remaining requests for the 
final reports (e.g. transport validation) can be resolved as a recommendation (Recommendation 7). 
Re-filtration is not performed and therefore not validated.  
For the initial scale validation, three PPQ batches of Filled Product of CoV2 preS dTM finished product 
have been produced at Sanofi S.r.l., Anagni site, Italy, at different dosages using a bracketing 
approach. Given the current pandemic, this approach is considered acceptable as it allowed to 
accelerate approval.  
For the additional scale validation, three PPQ batches of filled booster dose CoV2 preS dTM finished 
product have been produced at the Sanofi S.r.l., Anagni site, Italy. Commercial scales are considered 
suitably validated at the at the Sanofi S.r.l., Anagni site, Italy.  
2.3.3.3.  Product specification  
The CoV2 preS dTM Final Bulk Product is formulated into a stainless-steel tank and is not stored. 
Therefore, release specifications for the filled product and end of shelf-life have been provided. The 
finished product specifications include general tests, total protein content, relative antigen content, 
identity, potency, safety tests, fill volume and container closure integrity.  
A number of concerns were raised on the proposed specifications. A major objection was raised 
requesting adjustment of the specifications for potency to ensure sufficient potency throughout shelf 
life and further describe the approach to apply test variability correction for setting the proposed limits. 
During the review, the applicant provided additional information on the potency assay, assay validation 
and justification for the proposed specifications.  
The potency lower specification limit has been adjusted. The lower end of shelf-life potency 
specification is considered clinically justified and is considered acceptable. The applicant commits to re-
evaluate tightening of the potency release specification limit once data from a minimum of 30 batches 
are available. In addition, in a re-evaluation exercise of the potency specification, the applicant is 
Assessment report  
EMA/893684/2022  
Page 22/185 
 
 
 
recommended to optimise the method to reduce its variability and to include robust stability data on 
the B.1.351 strain to determine the decrease in potency over time. Finally, the applicant should 
implement three significant numbers for the potency specification (Recommendation 10). 
The total protein content lower specification limit is considered acceptable for both release and end of 
shelf-life specifications since total protein content is not considered stability indicating as shown by 
supportive data provided for the D614 vaccine. Regarding the consistency approach, the applicant 
commits to re-evaluate tightening of the total protein lower release specification limit based on a 
minimum of 30 batches (B.1.351) based on release data (Recommendation 10). 
At the present time there is data from a limited number of finished product batches available which 
hampers any meaningful statistical analysis to define a relevant upper limit based on process 
performance and consistency. Therefore, the applicant commits to establish an upper limit for the 
potency and total protein content release specifications starting with a minimum of 15 batches and will 
be finalized and submitted with a minimum of 30 B.1.351 batches (Recommendation 11). This is 
considered acceptable. 
Further, the applicant has also committed to implement a testing procedure for polysorbate 20 for 
release of commercial product after finalizing the development of a polysorbate 20 quantitation test 
without matrix interference to be performed on the finished product. An appropriate acceptance 
criterion for the specification will be identified after testing of a sufficient number of commercial 
B.1.351batches (Recommendation 12).  
A risk assessment for elemental impurities according to ICH Q3D has been performed. The safety risk 
associated with the presence of elemental impurities has been considered as negligible by the 
company. This is agreed. 
The nitrosamine risk assessment reports have been provided with this submission and have been 
included in section 3.2.R. The presence of nitrosamines in SARS-CoV 2 S protein monovalent bulks 
manufactured at Framingham and Vitry has been evaluated as unlikely. There is no risk of 
nitrosamines impurities in the finished product. 
Analytical methods 
Testing procedures and their validation are described in sufficient detail. Method validation has been 
described for all non-compendial methods. All excipients used to prepare the formulation buffer of the 
CoV2 preS dTM finished product are compendial. Therefore, no method validation is needed, and the 
information provided is considered acceptable. 
Reference materials 
Relevant information on the in-house reference standard(s) for potency estimation is provided in the 
dossier. The reference standards used for potency and identity testing of finished product are also used 
for active substance and are considered adequately qualified for routine release testing. The 
qualification of a new reference standard or/and a new positive control will follow the protocol as 
already described for the current standards. 
Batch analysis 
For the Anagni manufacturing site, a description of three commercial batches of the CoV2 preS dTM 
(B.1.351) Filled Product with corresponding batch analysis data has been provided. The release results 
for the clinical CoV2 preS dTM (B.1.351) finished product batch are available in eCTD section 3.2.P.2.3 
Assessment report  
EMA/893684/2022  
Page 23/185 
 
 
 
Manufacturing Process Development and in Section 3.2.P.5.4 Batch analyses. All release results 
presented are within the defined acceptance criteria. 
Container closure system 
The primary container closure system used for the CoV2 preS dTM finished product consists of a 
multi-dose type I borosilicate glass vial, a chlorobutyl rubber stopper and an aluminium seal with a 
plastic flip-off cap. The summary of the extractables study done has been provided. Sanofi commits to 
provide the results of the ongoing leachables study done on three batches of B.1.351 CoV2 preS dTM 
Filled Product by Q1 2023 (Recommendation 14). 
The container closure systems for the CoV2 preS dTM non-adjuvanted finished product is considered 
suitable for use. 
Adjuvant (AS03) 
AS03 is a well-known and already approved adjuvant manufactured by GSK. Relevant information has 
been provided in the dossier, including on composition, manufacturing and testing sites, specifications 
and information on the manufacturing authorisation. Considering that AS03 is a known excipient the 
information provided is adequate.  AS03 contains squalene as an excipient of animal origin. The 
adventitious agents risk assessment for AS03 has been provided with this submission and is 
considered acceptable. Further, relevant information with regard to specifications and testing were 
provided for AS03. There is no risk of nitrosamines impurities in AS03. The AS03 liquid formulation is 
filled in vial containers, sealed with rubber stoppers for liquid formulations and secured with flip-off 
caps. The container closure systems for the AS03 adjuvant is considered suitable for use. 
2.3.3.4.  Stability of the product 
Sanofi Pasteur proposes a 12-month shelf-life for the Filled Product when stored at +2°C to +8°C.  
Stability evaluation is based the completed stability study of 1 clinical CoV2 preS dTM B.1.351 Filled 
Product batch and on-going stability studies of three commercial batches under real-time long-term 
storage conditions and accelerated conditions.  
As indicated before, comparability of clinical and commercial lots has been shown, therefore stability 
data from the clinical lot are considered relevant. For the clinical batch long term stability study, data 
are available. The stability study conducted on the clinical batch is completed and fulfils the 
specifications in Section 3.2.P.5.1. For the three commercial batches, the current long term B.1.351 
database is very limited. However, the proposed shelf-life claim is justified by applying a kinetic 
stability model. The approach is supported. The applicant committed to immediately report any results 
of the on-going stability studies that may imply a significant risk to not comply with the end of shelf-
life specification.  
The tests performed for stability are general tests, total protein content, potency, purity, safety tests 
and container closure identity. ‘Purity by Relative Antigen Content’ stability acceptance criteria for the 
B.1.351 strain finished product will be implemented when at least 12 months of real-time stability data 
is available from at least 3 commercial B.1.351 batches with a total of 10 batches minimum 
(Recommendation 13). 
A photostability study on the finished product was performed as per ICH Guideline Q1B, leading to the 
conclusion that naked finished product vials are sensitive to visible and UV light, but secondary 
packaging guarantees sufficient protection from visible and UV light as per ICH. Sanofi Pasteur has 
Assessment report  
EMA/893684/2022  
Page 24/185 
 
 
 
included in its clinical documentation and in the SmPC, the recommendation to protect the product 
from light. 
An in-use stability study was performed with the purpose of providing data to assess the in-use shelf-
life for the mix and shoot formulation of CoV2 preS dTM finished product when combined with AS03. 
After mixing, the vaccine should be administered immediately or stored at 2 °C to 8 °C, protected from 
light, and used within 6 hours as reflected in the SmPC. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC are 
acceptable. The proposed 12 months shelf-life for the Filled Product, when stored at +2°C to +8°C, is 
considered acceptable. 
The VidPrevtyn Beta overall shelf life is based on the shorter shelf life between AS03 and antigens 
vials. For the finished product batches already available, the shorter shelf life was associated to the 
antigen vials and therefore was based on antigen stability data only. 
2.3.3.5.  Post approval change management protocol(s)  
The submitted post-approval change management protocol (PACMP) provides for the introduction of an 
additional manufacturing and testing site for the active substance. The site is covered by an EU GMP 
certificate. The strategy includes a process comparison and a product comparability assessment for 
VidPrevtyn Beta. The starting materials (WCB and WVB) are identical for all manufacturing sites.  
A high-level process comparison strategy between sending and receiving sites was provided and a 
potential impact of the change was evaluated. Similarly, process parameters were compared. The PPQ 
at receiving site includes three full-scale production batches. The approach used for testing product 
comparability has also been presented. Overall, the general approach is deemed acceptable. 
2.3.3.6.  Adventitious agents 
Cell substrates, virus seeds and raw materials used during manufacture of VidPrevtyn Beta are qualified 
by  adequate  testing  to  provide  high  confidence  that  extraneous  agents  are  not  present  in  the  final 
product.  The  master  and  working  virus  seeds  and  the  cell  bank  system  were  principally  adequately 
tested.  
No materials of porcine origin have been used for generation and maintenance of SF+ cells, or during 
recombinant protein production in SF+cells. Bovine-derived serum was used prior to the establishment 
of the MCB. Therefore, the risk of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) contamination is negligible. 
During the manufacturing, sufficient routine testing is performed to guarantee the absence of 
adventitious agents. Viral clearance studies have been performed. The calculated safety margin for 
baculovirus clearance has been justified according to ICH Q5A Appendix 5.  
2.3.3.7.  GMO 
Not applicable 
2.3.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
During the assessment the applicant changed the active substance from the D614 strain to the B.1.351 
strain, spike protein. Much of the B.1.351 dossier content remains the same as for D614 which had 
undergone assessment. The applicant has provided B.1.351 specific data and supportive D614 data 
Assessment report  
EMA/893684/2022  
Page 25/185 
 
 
 
where applicable. However, the final marketing authorisation application only concerns VidPrevtyn Beta 
(B.1.351 variant). 
Sufficient information regarding the manufacturing process, process controls and control of materials 
for the active substance and finished product part have been provided. 
Finished product process validation confirms consistent production of active substance and finished 
product of the required quality. Data have been provided for D614, which is considered supportive and 
sufficient. At the finished product stage, the manufacturing process is kept identical between the two 
strains and is therefore strain independent. Consequently, all finished product process development 
and process validation, and comparability investigations have been conducted with the D614 strain and 
are not reperformed for the B.1.351 strain. This approach is widely applied for implementation of 
influenza annual strain changes and was supported during a scientific advice for this B.1.351 strain 
vaccine. 
The comparability of the three active substance manufacturing sites was shown. PPQs were provided 
for the initial D614 strain, and Initial Process Verification (IPV) studies were provided for the current 
B.1.351 strain. Release test results have been provided and all results met the respective acceptance 
criteria.  
The active substance shelf life claim is supported by sufficient data and therefore considered 
acceptable.  
During the procedure, two major objections were raised, in relation to comparability between clinical 
site and Anagni finished product manufacture, and specifications. Data have been submitted by the 
applicant during the procedure in response to the major objections and other concerns raised. Further 
information on the resolution of major objections, other concerns and the rationale for accepting some 
open issues to be addressed post-authorisation as Recommendations is provided below. These cover 
various aspects of the active substance and finished product.  
During the procedure, a number of issues were raised concerning demonstration of comparability 
between active substance commercial (Framingham and Vitry) and phase III sites. The applicant 
provided additional data to address the questions. The comparability analysis demonstrates for both 
commercial active substance manufacturing sites that characterization and release test results are 
consistent between three PPQ batches, but for some tests, are slightly different. These differences 
have already been assessed within the scope of the initial D614 application. B.1.351 data were also 
provided, and the comparability exercise as a whole is considered acceptable. However, due to 
differences observed between the active substance manufacturing sites, final active substance process 
monitoring limits will be implemented when data for a minimum of 30 B.1.351 batches are available at 
each manufacturing site (Recommendation 3). 
The major objection on comparability affected the finished product manufacturing sites. Comparability 
is based on D614 batch release data together with process validation data; however, the initial 
analysis was hampered by limited batch data and the fact that the interim release criteria used for 
comparability assessment had a broader range based on lot-to-lot consistency. The provision of 
additional data during the evaluation procedure and further analysis by Equivalence Testing supported 
the comparability analysis between the sites, demonstrating the equivalence between the processes. 
To strengthen the original comparability study, the applicant committed to include the final D614 
stability data and provide the final report of the comparability assessment (Recommendation 8). In 
addition, final finished product process monitoring limits will be implemented when data for a minimum 
of 30 B.1.351 batches are available at the Anagni site (Recommendation 9). 
The major objection on specifications requested to adjust the specifications for potency to ensure 
sufficient potency throughout shelf life and to describe the approach to apply test variability correction 
Assessment report  
EMA/893684/2022  
Page 26/185 
 
 
 
used for setting protein content limits. During the review, the applicant adjusted the (D614) potency 
specification and provided additional information on the potency assay, assay validation and 
justification for the proposed specifications. The approach to determine potency test variability has 
been described and is accepted. The revised lower end of shelf-life potency specification is considered 
clinically justified. However, since the proposed specification is based on limited manufacturing 
experience, the applicant commits to re-evaluate tightening of the potency and total protein release 
specification limits once data from a minimum of 30 B.1.351 batches is available, and to optimise the 
method to reduce its variability (Recommendation 10). 
In addition, the applicant commits to establish an upper limit for potency and total protein content 
release specifications, starting with a minimum of 15 batches, and will be finalized with a minimum of 
30 B.1.351 batches (Recommendation 11).  
During the procedure, questions have been raised regarding the active substance release 
specifications. The specification for Appearance has been changed, and ‘Potency to Total Protein 
Content Ratio’ has been included as an additional release test as requested. In addition, specifications 
for potency, purity and host cell protein have been further justified. The Relative Antigen Content 
determination has been added to the active substance and finished product stability specifications and 
the current acceptance criterion is “for information only” due to limited batch data, where an 
acceptance criterion will be implemented when further real-time stability data are available 
(Recommendation 5 and 13). In addition, the applicant will review the total protein content ratio 
specification when data from 30 batches measured with the specific potency test are available 
(Recommendation 6).  
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor additional unresolved quality issues 
having no impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product. These points are put forward and agreed as 
recommendations for future quality development. Some recommendations derive from the D614 
submission but are still applicable for the current B.1.351 submission and therefore the data should be 
obtained with the B.1.351 strain, where applicable. 
The proposed 12 months shelf life for the filled product is considered acceptable based on (limited) 
stability data supported by applying a kinetic stability model describing the loss of potency as function 
of time and temperature. The AS03 adjuvant is already approved in the EU. The information provided 
is considered adequate for a known excipient.  
The finished product should be protected from light and after mixing with AS03, the vaccine should be 
administered immediately or stored at 2 °C to 8 °C, protected from light, and used within 6 hours. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data have 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.3.6.  Recommendations for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points* for investigation:

2.4.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Vidprevtyn Beta (B.1.351) is a recombinant protein subunit vaccine to SARS-CoV-2 Beta variant virus 
and is built on prefusion-stabilized Spike (S) delta TM of SARS-CoV-2 as active substance. The vaccine 
formulation includes the AS03 adjuvant. 
The non-clinical studies conducted refer also to vaccine VidPrevtyn CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (D614). This 
relates to the applicant’s initial strategy to seek a marketing authorisation for VidPrevtyn (Wuhan 
based) as a vaccine to be used for primary series and as a booster.  
In the non-clinical studies, effective doses were re-calculated based on new assays which differentiate 
structurally correct CoV2 preS dTM trimers from host cell proteins (HCP) impurities. When appropriate, 
the non-clinical studies will refer to targeted and effective doses. The differences between the targeted 
and the effective dose levels correspond to an excess HCP content. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacology 
2.4.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The primary pharmacodynamic studies for VidPrevtyn CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (D614) was characterized 
through studies conducted in mice, non-human primates and hamsters.   
CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (D614) in mice 
Immunogenicity of CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (D614) was assessed in two studies in mice: Swiss Webster 
mice (CoV2-02_Ms study) and BALB/c mice (CoV2-03_Ms study). 
In the first study, groups of 10 outbred mice (Swiss Webster) were administered twice (day 0 and day 
21) at varying dose levels from targeted 0.167 μg to 4.5 μg/dose (recalculated to effective 0.04 μg to 
1.8 μg/dose), in the absence or presence of AS03 or AF03 at 1/10 of the intended human dose. No or 
very low IgG and PRNT50 responses were induced by the non-adjuvanted vaccine, whereas the AF03-, 
AS03-adjuvanted CoV2 preS dTM vaccines elicited high IgG responses after 1 injection across all dose 
levels tested. The IgG responses were further increased by the second injection (8-fold- difference 
between D21 and D36). Moreover, a slight dose-effect was observed on the S-specific IgG responses 
and on the neutralising antibody responses across the targeted antigen dose range tested from 0.167 
to 4.5 μg. The CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (D614) vaccine elicited both S-specific IgG1 and IgG2a responses 
indicating presence of Th2- and Th1-associated Ab responses with a Th2 bias as previously 
documented in published literature for oil-in-water emulsion adjuvants in mice. No or low cellular 
responses were detected. 
In the second study, groups of 5 Balb/c mice were immunized twice (D0 and D14) with adjuvanted 
AF03 or AS03 vaccines with a targeted dose of 4.5 µg (effective dose of 1.8 µg). Control groups 
received AF03 alone of a mRNA/LNP vaccine (Th1-inducing vaccine control). Ten days after the second 
immunization, S-specific T cells secreting Th1 (IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-2) and Th2 (IL-4 and IL-5) cytokines 
were determined. S-specific CD4 T cells were detected at low levels in the CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 
vaccine immunized mice, with a predominance of TNF-α secreting cells (Th1) (around 0.1%), and 
some IL-5 secreting cells (Th2) (around 0.05%, above levels in naïve controls). The cytokine profile 
suggests a mixed Th1/Th2 response induced by the CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 vaccine in BALB/c mice. No 
S-specific CD8 T cell responses were detected.

CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (D614) in non-human primates 
Immunogenicity and efficacy of CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (D614) were assessed in two non-human 
primate studies: CoV2-01_NHP and CoV2-04_NHP.  
In the first study (CoV2-01_NHP), groups of 6 rhesus macaques (3-7 years-old, males and females) 
received twice (on D0 and D22) the CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 vaccine through intramuscular route, either 
5 or 15 μg targeted dose (1.3-2 μg and 3.9-6.1 μg effective doses), the CoV2 preS dTM alone (15 µg 
targeted dose), or were left unvaccinated (as control with PBS). The rhesus macaques were challenged 
28 days post-dose 2 with 106 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020 strain) by both, intranasal and 
intratracheal routes.  
This study included passive transfer studies to hamsters. Golden Syrian hamsters were randomized 
into five groups (4M and 4F). Total IgG were isolated from plasma collected three weeks post-dose 2 in 
the AS03-high dose group or naïve NHP, and passively transferred to naïve hamsters intraperitoneally 
one day prior to challenge. 
In immunized macaques, no significant dose effect was observed for the tested dose range, but the 
second dose effect and the AS03 adjuvanting effect were clearly demonstrated by a significant increase 
in humoral (IgG binding, virus-neutralising antibodies) and CD4 T cell responses to the vaccine 
antigen, including prefusion S protein and specific subdomains such as receptor binding domain (RBD). 
The neutralising antibody titres against 614D strain were found generally higher than those measured 
for a panel of human convalescent sera. Titres of neutralisation against variants of concern B.1.351 
and P.1 (B.1.1.28) significantly declined (around 5-fold reduction), which could be expected. High level 
of cross-neutralising activity against the B.1.1.7 and B.1.429 variants was observed. S-specific CD8 T 
cell responses were undetectable in most NHPs. 
With respect to protection, both antigen doses of CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 vaccine showed protection in 
NHPs against a moderate SARS-CoV-2 viral challenge (Wuhan, D614 strain), four weeks post-dose 2. 
No viral replication was detected in the lungs on D2 and D4 post-challenge and no viral N protein was 
detected in the lungs at necropsy (D7 to D9 post-challenge). Moreover, neither increase in lung 
inflammation, nor any clinical signs linked to the SARS-CoV-2 infection were observed in the CoV2 
preS dTM-AS03 vaccine groups compared to naïve control and unadjuvanted vaccine groups. However, 
the virus used for the challenge was characterized as attenuated (post-study finding). The PBS control 
group of animals showed only partial infection post-challenge. Therefore, evaluation of efficacy of CoV2 
preS dTM-AS03 vaccine was repeated at VRC (CoV2-04_NHP study) against a wild type, non-mutated, 
highly virulent viral stock (NR-53780). In relation to the transfer study to hamsters, adoptive transfer 
of pooled IgGs, purified from NHPs to hamsters, strongly protected hamsters from body weight loss 
after IN challenge with 3x104 PFU of a highly virulent SARS-CoV-2 stock (viral stock: NR-53780). 
Histopathology examination of the hamster lungs was not performed, and only measurements of viral 
load in the upper respiratory tract (URT) were conducted and reported, which is not relevant to assess 
vaccine protection in this animal model. 
In the second study (CoV2-04_NHP), two groups of 8 macaques (4-14 years) previously immunised 
with measles, were IM immunized on D0 and D21 with a target dose of CoV2 preS dTM of either 5 or 
15 µg (4 and 12 µg effective doses respectively) per animal with AS03 as adjuvant, or diluent 
(placebo). All rhesus macaques were challenged 21 days post-dose 2 with 3 x 106 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 
(USA-WA1/2020 strain, qualified stock) by both IN and IT routes.  
Both effective dose levels elicited high systemic antibody responses against S protein, RBD and NTD 
subdomains. The post-dose 1 S-specific IgG were improved by dose 2, with an increase in titres and 
avidity. In addition, mucosal S-specific IgG responses were detected post-dose 2 in the lungs and 
nares of vaccinated animals. 2 IM injections elicited high titres of functional antibodies measured in

various assays, and these titres were significantly higher than those measured for two panels of 
human convalescent sera. There was high level of cross-neutralisation of the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant, 
but neutralisation of B.1.351 (Beta) variant was lower compared to titres against D614G parental virus 
(5 to 10-fold drop). A mixed Th1/Th2 profile of S-specific CD4 T cell responses and S-specific CD4 Tfh 
cells were also evidenced. CD8 T cell responses were not detected. 
In terms of efficacy, the study showed that two immunizations with low or high dose CoV2 preS dTM-
AS03 vaccine conferred robust protection against viral replication in the lower and upper airways after 
a virulent challenge with the parental SARS-CoV-2 strain (qualified stock). A strong reduction of the 
viral replication was demonstrated on D2 and D4 in the two vaccine groups and no viral replication was 
detected 4 days post-challenge in the lungs and nares from the high dose group indicating a stronger 
and faster viral clearance in this group.  
7 days post-challenge, lung pathology and inflammation were reduced in vaccinated macaques 
compared to naïve macaques. No histopathological changes of the lungs nor increase in inflammatory 
cytokines or chemokines (Th1/Th2) were observed 7 and 14 days post-challenge, which indicate no 
increased risk of Vaccine Associated Enhanced Respiratory Disease (VAERD). 
CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (D614) in hamsters 
Immunogenicity and efficacy of CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (D614) were also assessed in one study in 
hamsters (CoV2-02_Hm study). Groups of 8 Golden Syrian hamsters were immunized once or twice 
(three weeks apart) with a target dose of CoV2 preS dTM of either targeted 0.75 or 2.25 µg/dose 
(effective dose 0.2 or 0.6 µg/dose at D0, and 0.1 or 0.3 µg/dose at D21) with or without adjuvants 
(AF03 or AS03). A group of eight animals received PBS only to serve as a non-vaccinated control 
(placebo). On D56 (five weeks post last injection), all hamsters were inoculated intranasally with 2.3 
104 PFU of SARS CoV-2 with same attenuated viral strain as used in the NHP challenge study (CoV2-
01_NHP). 
Results from hamster model are generally consistent with those from mice and NHPs, demonstrating 
high immunogenicity of the CoV2 preS dTM-aduvanted vaccine formulation. All CoV2 preS dTM vaccine 
formulations produced Spike-specific IgG responses after one injection, but low or no pseudovirus 
neutralising Ab titres. After the second dose, all vaccine treated groups showed increases in S-specific 
IgG titres and pseudoviral neutralising antibodies. The adjuvant effect was observed on neutralising 
titres after 2 injections. 
Following challenge, two injections of CoV2 preS dTM, unadjuvanted or formulated with AF03 or AS03, 
provided protection against viral challenge with SARS-CoV-2 (clade 19, D614), carried out 5 weeks 
after the last immunization. A minor but significant reduction of body weight loss was detected for the 
high dose CoV2 preS dTM-AF03 group. In contrast to the PBS control group, protection was 
demonstrated in all vaccine groups after two injections as the viral replication was controlled by D7 
and reduced on D4 post-challenge in nares and lungs. Also, all vaccine formulations were able to 
reduce lung lesions regardless of the antigen dose in the 2-dose cohort, while high pathology scores 
were observed in the lungs of the PBS control group. No sign of vaccine-associated enhanced disease 
was observed for the CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 candidate. 
CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (D614, B.1.351 and D614+B.1.351) in hamsters 
Immunogenicity and efficacy were studied in hamsters (CoV2-03_Hm). In this study, the monovalent 
CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (D614) and (B.1.351) vaccines and the bivalent CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 vaccine 
(D614+B.1.351) were analysed in SARS-CoV-2 in naïve female Golden Syrian hamsters (n=8/group), 
6-8 weeks old. The animals were injected via the intramuscular route two doses (D0 and D21). 1 µg 
monovalent CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 or 2 µg bivalent CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 in 100 µl/dose were 
administered into the animals. Three weeks after the 1st dose and two weeks after the 2nd dose, the 
Assessment report  
EMA/893684/2022  
Page 31/185 
 
 
 
vaccine immunogenicity of the vaccines was analysed by measuring serum SARS-CoV-2 S-specific IgG 
antibody titres. After the 2nd vaccine dose on D35, neutralising antibody titres against D614G, Alpha 
(B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351) and Delta (B.1.617.2) variants were analysed. On Day 49, hamsters were 
challenged via the intranasal route with SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 strain at 5x102 TCID50 for cohort A 
(groups 1 to 4) or NY D614G strain at 9.8x103 TCID50 for cohort B (groups 5 to 8) or B.1.1.7 strain at 
1.58 x 106 TCID50 for cohort C (groups 9 to 12). All the cohorts included a buffer control group. 
In general, all three vaccine formulations showed high wild type S-protein specific IgG antibody titres 
and high neutralising antibody titres against several SARS-CoV-2 variants after two vaccine doses. 
More precisely, the bivalent vaccine induced high neutralising antibody titres against D614G, Alpha, 
Delta and Beta variants; the monovalent D614 vaccine induced high neutralising antibody titres 
against D614G, Alpha and Delta variants, but low Beta-specific titres; and the monovalent B.1.351 
vaccine induced high neutralising antibody titres against Beta variant, slightly lower D614G and Alpha 
titre and low Delta titre. All vaccine formulation seems to be well tolerated as indicated by the stable 
body weight during the study. Furthermore, the viral load after challenge with D614G, Alpha or Beta 
variants was reduced compared to the buffer-treated control animals. In histopathological analysis of 
the lung, lower inflammation than in buffer-control animals, and no nucleocapsid protein expression 
were observed in the vaccinated animals after challenge. 
CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (D614, B.1.351 and D614+B.1.351) in non-human primates 
Immunogenicity from the beta variant CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 monovalent (B.1.351) and bivalent (D614 
+ B.1.351) vaccines were studied in in naïve (CoV2-06_NHP study) and non-naïve non-human 
primates (CoV2-07_NHP and CoV2-08_NHP) 
In the first study (CoV2-06_NHP), fifty-four adults cynomolgus macaques (males and females) from 2 
to 8 years of age were randomized in nine groups of six macaques. The macaques were immunized 
with the three vaccine formulations (D614, B.1.351 or bivalent) at doses of 2.5, 5 and 10 μg per 
antigen, adjuvanted with AS03. The immunizations were performed by two IM injections three weeks 
apart in a volume of 0.5 mL/injection.  
After two doses, all vaccine formulations induced high S- and RBD-specific IgG binding antibody titres 
against different SARS-CoV-2 VoC (D614, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Omicron) independent of the 
dose level. Even low SARS-CoV-1 RBD-specific IgG binding antibody titres were measured in the 
different vaccine formulations. However, the IgG binding antibody titres declined relative fast over time 
in all vaccine formulations as demonstrated for the wt S-specific IgG antibody response. In addition, 
the applicant could show that the different vaccine formulations induce strong, dose-independent 
neutralising antibody titres against different VoC after two vaccine doses. The different vaccine 
formulations showed different response patterns. However, all tested vaccine formulations showed low 
neutralising antibody responses against Omicron BA.1. In line with the IgG binding antibody titres, the 
neutralising antibody titres declined also over time. All vaccine formulations showed comparable 
memory B-cell responses in PBMCs. 
In the second study (CoV2-07_NHP), four groups of four (2/sex) cynomolgus macaques (4-10 years of 
age), previously immunized twice (21 days apart) with various COVID-19 mRNA-LNP vaccine were 
randomized according to sex, age, weight, mRNA vaccine construct used for the primary immunization, 
and their SARS-CoV-2 (D614) neutralising antibody (Nab) titres on D35 (they had positive nAb titres) 
to receive the booster injection of 5µg (non-adjuvanted monovalent (B.1.351) CoV2 preS dTM, AS03-
adjuvanted monovalent (D614 or B.1.351) or bivalent (D614+B.1.351) CoV2 preS dTM) administered 
by IM route into the right deltoid was performed seven months after the first mRNA immunization.  
The results from the booster study showed that one booster dose of AS03-adjuvanted CoV2 preS dTM, 
D614 (parental) or B.1.351 (Beta), in monovalent or bivalent (D614 + B.1.351) formulations, 
Assessment report  
EMA/893684/2022  
Page 32/185 
 
 
 
significantly boosted pre-existing neutralising antibodies to levels higher than post-primary 
immunization. Furthermore, the booster elicited high and stable cross-neutralising antibodies covering 
the four SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta) and SARS-CoV-1 in all 
animals as soon as D7 whatever the vaccine formulation. Notably, the non-adjuvanted CoV2 preS dTM 
B.1.351 vaccine formulation also boosted and broadened the neutralising antibody responses, though 
at lower levels compared to the AS03-adjuvanted CoV2 preS dTM B.1.351 vaccine candidate. 
In the third study (CoV2-08_NHP), five groups of 4-5 male rhesus macaques (4-10 years old) 
previously immunized twice (21 days apart, 7 months earlier with different CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 
(D614) vaccine candidates) received a 5µg booster dose of monovalent adjuvanted vaccines D614 and 
B.1.351, non-adjuvanted B.1.351, and a bivalent adjuvanted vaccine (total booster dose of 5 µg or 10 
µg).  
The results showed that a booster injection with any of the tested vaccine formulations induced strong 
memory Spike-specific IgG and neutralising antibody responses against the parental D614 strain. The 
booster injections also extended the neutralisation to the B.1.351 variant and other tested SARS-CoV-
2 variants of concern (VoC) (B.1.1.7, B.1.1.28 and B.1.617.2) and SARS-CoV-1. The non-adjuvanted 
CoV2 preS dTM B.1.351 vaccine formulation significantly boosted and broadened the neutralising 
antibody responses, although at lower levels compared to the AS03-adjuvanted CoV2 preS dTM 
B.1.351 vaccine candidate. 
2.4.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No studies on the secondary pharmacodynamics have been performed, which is in accordance with 
applicable guidelines. 
2.4.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
No studies on the safety pharmacology have been performed, which is in accordance with applicable 
guidelines. 
2.4.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No studies on the pharmacodynamic drug interactions have been performed, which is in accordance 
with applicable guidelines. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
In accordance with WHO guidelines on non-clinical evaluation of vaccines (WHO 2005) and vaccine 
adjuvants and adjuvanted vaccines (WHO 2013), traditional absorption, distribution, metabolism, and 
excretion (ADME) evaluations are not generally needed for vaccines. The safety concerns associated 
with vaccines are generally not related to the pharmacokinetics but are related to the potential 
induction of immune response. 
2.4.4.  Toxicology 
The non-clinical toxicology program was conducted only for the parental vaccine Vidprevtyn (D614) 
due to the high similarity between Vidprevtyn parental D614 and Vidprevtyn Beta-specific B.1.351.  
Assessment report  
EMA/893684/2022  
Page 33/185 
 
 
 
The non-clinical toxicology program consists of two repeat-dose toxicity studies and one developmental 
and reproductive toxicity study. All three studies were conducted in New Zealand White rabbits and in 
compliance with GLP.  
Regarding AS03, toxicity data have previously been generated after administration alone or in 
combination with vaccine antigens, such as the H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccines Pandemrix and 
Arepanrix which contain AS03 at the same dose-level as the CoV2 preS dTM AS03 vaccine.  
2.4.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
No single dose toxicity studies were performed by the applicant, which was agreed. 
2.4.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
Data from two repeat dose toxicity studies were provided: 5003471 and 5003591. The first study 
(5003471) was performed with a Ph I/II vaccine batch, whereas the second study (5003591) used an 
antigen batch derived from an intermediate Ph III manufacturing process. There are two main 
considerations with the vaccine batches: first, the host cell proteins (HCP) impurity level is higher than 
in the clinical production batches. This is acceptable since a high HCP impurity level represent a worst-
case scenario. The second issue, similarly as in some of the primary pharmacodynamic studies, the 
actual antigen concentration was considerably lower than targeted (effective concentration for the first 
and second studies was only 26% and 48% of target, respectively).  
The four-week repeat-dose toxicity in rabbits with 2-week recovery (5003471) was a study that 
consisted of two phases: a single dose and a repeat-dose (3 doses) phase where animals were 
vaccinated every two weeks (D1, D15 and D29). Each of the phases included a control group 
(physiological saline), a group receiving only the antigen (CoV-2 preS dTM) and two groups consisting 
of antigen and one of the two adjuvants (AF03 or AS03). The target and effective intramuscular 
vaccine dose were 15 µg and 3.9 μg CoV-2 preS dTM per dose, respectively. Except for the low antigen 
dose, the design of the toxicity study is considered to follow the recommendations provided in relevant 
non-clinical WHO vaccine guidelines.  
Overall, the vaccine antigen alone or with adjuvants AF03 or AS03 were well tolerated in rabbits. There 
were no unscheduled mortality, vaccine related effects to clinical observations, body weight, food 
consumption, body temperature or ocular changes. At Day 15, all animals vaccinated with antigen and 
adjuvant were positive for S-specific IgG antibodies while some of the animals in the unadjuvanted 
group were still negative. However, at Day 31 and 45, all vaccine treated animals (with or without 
adjuvant) were positive for S-specific IgG antibodies. Animals treated with antigen and adjuvant 
generally had significantly higher ELISA titres than those vaccinated without adjuvant. The only 
toxicological effects considered related to the vaccine were transient and non-adverse changes in 
haematology, coagulation, and clinical chemistry parameters indicative of a transient acute phase 
response/inflammation. These changes correlated with non-adverse histopathological findings of 
increased severity of acute/subacute to subacute/chronic mixed cell inflammation at the injection site 
and in the overlying skin of animals administered CoV-2 preS dTM with either adjuvant. In both 
phases, increases in spleen weights were observed. This correlated with increased lymphoid cellularity 
in both the interim (recovery only) and repeat-dose phases. Increased lymphoid cellularity was also 
observed in the iliac, inguinal, and sacral lymph nodes. 
The two-week repeat-dose toxicity study in rabbits with 2-week recovery (5003591) was aimed to 
evaluate the local tolerance and systemic toxicity of two doses two weeks apart (D1 and D15) with 
CoV-2 preS dTM-AS03. The target and effective intramuscular vaccine dose were 5 µg and 2.4 µg CoV-
Assessment report

2 preS dTM per dose, respectively. Except for the low antigen dose, the design of the toxicity study 
and measured parameters are considered to follow the recommendations provided in relevant non-
clinical WHO vaccine guidelines.  
Overall, the vaccine with adjuvant AS03 was well tolerated in rabbits. There was no unscheduled 
mortality, or vaccine-related effects to clinical observations, body weights, food consumption or ocular 
changes. Only slight increases in mean body temperature were noted for both sexes of vaccine-treated 
animals 24 hours after the first and second dose. It was a slight increase with general overlap of 
individual values with the range of the control and pre-study values. This effect may be related to the 
vaccine since vaccine-induced increases in body temperature are not uncommon. 
A higher incidence of very slight to slight erythema and/or oedema on Days 1 and 15 was observed at 
the injection sites in vaccinated animals. These changes were transient and had generally resolved by 
4 days following injection. Toxicological effects detected were transient and consisted of non-adverse 
changes in haematology, coagulation, and clinical chemistry parameters indicative of a transient acute 
phase response/inflammation. These changes correlated with non-adverse histopathological findings of 
increased severity of mixed cell inflammation (subacute/chronic) and presence of fibrosis/fibroplasia at 
the injection site and in the overlying skin of animals administered the test item. In the main and 
recovery group of vaccinated animals, increases in spleen weights (~50%) were observed in males. 
This correlated with increased lymphoid cellularity only in the recovery group (Day 29). An increase in 
adrenal weights (~40%) in vaccinated males was reported in the main group (D17). However, this 
finding was not correlated with any histopathological changes. Similar adrenal weight changes were 
not observed at the end of recovery (Day 29), nor in the previous repeat dose toxicity study. Increased 
lymphoid cellularity and/or mixed cell infiltration was also observed in the iliac, inguinal, and sacral 
lymph nodes in both main and recovery groups. 
2.4.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
The adjuvant AS03 is already an approved adjuvant in the EU. Based on the data provided, AS03 did 
not show any genotoxic potential. 
2.4.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies have been performed in accordance with the WHO Guidelines on Non-clinical 
Evaluation of Vaccines (2005) and Guidelines on the Non-clinical Evaluation of Vaccine Adjuvants and 
Adjuvanted Vaccines (2014). The absence of these studies is considered acceptable. 
2.4.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity (DART) study was carried out in rabbits (20288238). This was 
a GLP compliant study. Female NZW rabbits were administered intramuscularly with the CoV-2 preS 
dTM adjuvanted with AS03 (formulation equivalent to the phase 3 manufacturing process material) in 
0.5 mL volume (dosage at 10 and 15 µg CoV-2 preS dTM antigen, respectively), at 24 and 10 days 
pre-mating and on gestation days (GD) 6, 12 and 27. Control female animals received placebo on the 
same occasions. 
The repeated administrations of CoV-2 preS dTM-AS03 at dosages indicated above did not adversely 
affect reproductive or developmental parameters, with no vaccine-related adverse effects identified on 
the mating performance, female fertility, embryonic and foetal development and growth, parturition, 
and survival and development of the offspring through postnatal day 35. 
Assessment report  
EMA/893684/2022  
Page 35/185 
 
 
 
Furthermore, in all CoV-2 preS dTM-AS03 vaccinated dams, high S-specific IgG response was detected 
with no dose-response observed. Similar high anti-S IgG titres were also detected in F1 generation 
foetuses and offspring from the vaccinated dam groups, thus confirming the transfer of maternal 
antibodies during the gestational period and also in the postnatal stages of development. 
2.4.4.6.  Local Tolerance  
No stand-alone local tolerance study was conducted. This is acceptable and in line with relevant 
guidance on non-clinical vaccine development since local tolerance was evaluated in repeated dose 
toxicity studies. 
2.4.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In accordance with the CHMP Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products 
for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447100), due to their nature vaccines are unlikely to result in a 
significant risk to the environment. Therefore, environmental risk assessment studies are not provided 
in this application for Marketing Authorisation, which is considered acceptable. 
2.4.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The pharmacology of Vidprevtyn (D614 and B.1.351 vaccine variants) has been adequately addressed 
in mice, hamsters and NHP, including extensive characterization of immunogenicity profile and the 
clear demonstration of protective activity of the vaccine following primary dose series. In each animal 
model, the beneficial effects of the second dose administration and AS03 adjuvant were shown, 
supporting choice of 2-doses regimen for primary vaccination and inclusion of AS03 in vaccine 
formulation. A slight dose effect was shown on the parental D614 vaccine immunogenicity in outbred 
mice, but no significant dose effect observed in NHP in dose ranges tested. However, the protection 
data in NHPs revealed a trend for a stronger and faster viral clearance in the high dose group (12 µg) 
compared to low dose group (4 µg).  
Intramuscular administration of a single dose of various vaccine formulations (non-adjuvanted 
monovalent B.1.351, AS03-adjuvanted monovalent D614 & B.1.351 or bivalent), 7 months after 
completion of the primary vaccination in the vaccine-primed macaques, induced a strong recall of the 
initial neutralising antibody responses against the parental D614G strain, and extended the 
neutralisation to B.1.351 (Beta) variant and all other known variants of concerns (B.1.1.7/Alpha, 
B.1.1.28/Gamma, B.1.617.2/Delta and Omicron), as well as to SARS-CoV-1. The high IgG titres were 
stable between D7 and D28 post-boost, and then declined slowly until 6 months, the final timepoint 
analysed. 
Of importance, animal challenge studies in hamsters and NHP showed protection when compared to 
control groups. No sign of the potential risk of vaccine-associated enhanced lung pathology was 
observed. 
There are no studies performed with Vidprevtyn D614, B.1.351 for the secondary pharmacodynamics, 
the safety pharmacology, and the pharmacodynamic drug interactions. Similarly, no pharmacokinetic 
studies were carried out with Vidprevtyn. The omission of these studies is in accordance with the 
applicable regulatory guidelines and is thus acceptable. 
The non-clinical toxicology program was conducted only for the parental vaccine Vidprevtyn (D614) 
due to the high similarity between Vidprevtyn parental D614 and Vidprevtyn Beta-specific B.1.351. 
This is acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/893684/2022  
Page 36/185 
 
 
 
In the two pivotal repeat-dose toxicity study, Vidprevtyn D614 was overall well tolerated and safe in 
young rabbits. The test article itself as well as the adjuvant AS03 and AF03 did not show adverse 
toxicity in the animals after intramuscular injection. 
Both toxicity studies were GLP-compliant, and their study designs were in general in agreement with 
the applicable guidelines. However, some limitation of both repeat-dose toxicity studies is the antigen 
contents/dose administered to animals (3.9 µg and 2.4 µg respectively), which were lower than the 
intended human dose (10 µg). This was due to unintended calculation mistake. The impact of antigen 
content on vaccine-induced immune responses is assumed to be much smaller than did the AS03 
adjuvant and the dosing regimen, as clearly revealed by the results of pharmacodynamics studies in 
mice and NHPs. On the µg antigen/body weight basis, the administered antigen amount to rabbits was 
6.5-fold higher compared to human. The interpretation of the study results and the following 
conclusions were not affected by the lower antigen amount. 
The clinical pathology findings in both repeat-dose toxicity studies are similar. After injecting of the 
test article, the rabbits showed overall mild toxicity. In general, the observed findings were more 
severe in animals injected with the adjuvanted vaccine (AF03 or AS03) than injected with the non-
adjuvanted vaccine. Most of the clinical blood parameters were minimal to mild, except for the CRP 
concentrations, which showed a marked increase in the vaccinated animals. These changes were of 
transient nature except for white blood cells, which were still slightly increased in rabbits treated with 
adjuvanted vaccine after the 2-week recovery period.  
The microscopic and macroscopic pathology of the rabbits revealed findings in the spleen (increased 
spleen weight, mixed cell inflammation), lymph nodes (enlargement, mixed cell inflammation) and 
injection site/overlying skin (mixed cell inflammation, swelling, haemorrhage, fibrosis). As expected, 
the severity of the findings was higher in adjuvanted vaccine groups than in the non-adjuvanted 
vaccine group. Most of the pathology findings were still observed after the 2-week recovery period, 
indicating a chronicity of the results and an ongoing immune reaction. However, the observed findings 
were in general slightly milder than shortly after the last dose. 
In a GLP-compliant DART study, vaccination of rabbits with parental CoV-2 preS dTM-AS03 D614 did 
not adversely affect the mating performance, female pregnancy, embryonic and foetal development, 
parturition or post-natal development. 
In conclusion, the VidPrevtyn was overall well tolerated and safe in rabbits. Both adjuvanted vaccine 
formulations inducted higher immunogenicity compared to the non-adjuvanted vaccine and thus, more 
severe reactions were seen. The observed findings were expected and common for adjuvanted 
vaccines injected by the intramuscular route. 
2.4.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No major non-clinical issues are identified in this application. Several concerns were identified and 
have been properly addressed by the applicant. The CHMP is of the view that non-clinical data reveal 
no special hazard for humans based on appropriate studies of repeat dose toxicity and reproductive 
and developmental toxicity. SARS-CoV-2 prefusion Spike delta TM protein, recombinant (B.1.351 
strain) is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.5.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
No pharmacokinetics studies have been conducted for VidPrevtyn Beta. This is because 
pharmacokinetics studies are generally not needed for vaccines, consistent with current Guidelines on 
clinical evaluation of vaccines. 
2.5.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
The pharmacodynamic profile of vaccines is defined by their immunogenicity, as detailed in the CHMP 
guideline “Guideline on Clinical Evaluation of New Vaccines” (EMEA/CHMP/VWP/164653/2005). As 
immunogenicity data of this vaccine are used to support the authorisation of this vaccine, 
immunogenicity data are included under the clinical efficacy section. 
Assays 
In study VAT00013, the study samples were verified by the CRB APHP SU (central biological resources 
center) and tested by Unité des Virus Emergents, UMR190, IHU Méditerranée Infection. 
Neutralising antibodies against European strain of SARS-CoV-2 and variants of interest (Pr X. De 
Lamballerie, IHU Méditerrannée, Marseille, France) to support primary immunogenicity endpoints 
The microneutralisation test is performed according to the published protocol (Gallian P. et al, 2002). 
The test uses a clinical strain of SARS-CoV-2 (100 TCID50/well), Vero E6 cells and a readout by the 
reading of the cytopathic effect (CPE) at 5 days post-infection. It is a VNT100 (100% of wells lysed in 
quadruplicate format). According to the Applicant, its performance is very close to a PRNT90 test. The 
test is automated in the NSB3 laboratory for all dilution and distribution steps and for the reading of 
the CPE. The dilutions tested are 20, 40, 80, 160, 320, 640, 1280. The range is extended if a titre of 
1280 is observed at first intension. This assay was not validated and therefore not suitable for intended 
purpose. As a result, samples tested with this assay were subject to a re-test using the validated 
Monogram Psv assay. 
Anti SARS-CoV-2 antibodies anti-Spike (Pr X. De Lamballerie, IHU Méditerrannée, Marseille, France) to 
support secondary immunogenicity endpoints 
The CE-marked ELISA kit from Euroimmun (Luebeck, Germany) targets anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG 
antibodies directed against the S1 domain of the virus’ Spike protein is used according to the 
recommendations given by the manufacturer. As justified by the Applicant, this method is frequently 
cited in peer-reviewed primary literature and exhibits diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and correlation 
to plaque reduction neutralisation test (PRNT50) and the « First WHO International Standard for anti-
SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin » (NIBSC Code: 20/136), demonstrating suitability for its intended use 
Assessment report  
EMA/893684/2022

for the quantitative detection of antibodies against the S1 antigen of SARS-CoV-2 to support a 
secondary endpoint.  
ELISpot IFN CD4 and CD8 (Pr E. Tartour, laboratoire d’immunologie biologique, Hôpital Européen 
Georges Pompidou, APHP, Paris, France) to support secondary endpoints / ancillary subgroup analysis 
This test was performed in a subset of participants from each booster group. ELISpot uses a 
commercially available kit from Mabtech or C.T.L. The peptides are purchased from JPT technologies. 
This technique has been accredited by the French accreditation agency Cofrac.  
In study VAT00002, immunogenicity assessments for D614G variant and for Beta (B.1.351) variant 
used the validated SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralising assay performed at Monogram laboratory.  
Immunogenicity assessment for the Delta (B.1.617.2) variant in Study VAT00002 – Supplemental 
Phase III Cohort 2 used the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralisation assay performed at Nexelis 
laboratory. The Applicant confirmed that the status of the Nexelis assay used to measure neutralising 
antibodies against the Delta strain was exploratory at the time when testing of blood samples in clinical 
trials was carried out. Since then, the Nexelis assay has been validated. 
The following three different assays in 3 different laboratories were used to perform immunogenicity 
assessment for the Omicron strains BA.1, BA.2, and BA.4. The Monogram assay for the assessment of 
the immune response against BA.1 is qualified, whereas the assays for BA.2 and BA.4 immune 
response assessment are explorative. 
•  Monogram: Lentivirus-based pseudovirus neutralisation assay (qualified assay), Omicron BA.1 
• 
Institut Pasteur (Olivier Schwartz Lab): S-fuse rapid live-virus neutralisation assay (exploratory 
assay), Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 
•  National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD), South Africa (Penny Moore Lab): 
Lentivirus-based pseudovirus neutralisation assay (exploratory assay), Omicron BA.1 and BA.4. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
In the context of vaccines, PK studies are not required because the PK is not considered informative 
towards the determination of an optimal dose and the metabolic pathways of vaccines are generally 
understood. 
The applicant has performed several assays to characterise the vaccine-induced immune response. At 
the present time, there is no established immunological correlate of protection against SARS-CoV-2 
infection. The evaluation of the protective effect of VidPrevtyn Beta is based on bridging clinical 
immunogenicity results to Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine which has been shown to be protective against 
COVID-19. No efficacy studies with VidPrevtyn Beta have been performed. 
In pivotal study VAT00013, the applicant confirmed that the microneutralisation assay used to support 
the primary endpoints is lacking an official validation which is considered critical for assessment of the 
pivotal study results. The applicant provided a re-analysis based on re-tested samples using the 
validated Monogram assay. A validated Monogram laboratory SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralisation 
(PsVN) assay against D614G, Omicron BA.1 and BA.4/5 variant strains was used. The primary and 
secondary objectives of the VAT00013 post-hoc analyses were assessed using the results generated 
following Monogram PsVN assay testing. This was acceptable.  
In VAT00002, the bioanalytical method used were acceptable for their intended purposes. 
Assessment report  
EMA/893684/2022

2.5.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pivotal evidence for this MAA is based on induction of neutralising antibodies by VidPrevtyn Beta 
vaccination compared to vaccination with the authorised mRNA vaccine with known efficacy. This is 
acceptable. The immunogenicity results used to infer efficacy are presented in the clinical efficacy. 
2.5.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The clinical development plan of CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 vaccine is based on the evolution of SARS-CoV-
2 global pandemic. The vaccine was firstly developed with the global spreading of the original D614 
strain. The CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (D614) vaccine was administered as a 2-dose primary series and as a 
single booster dose in clinical studies. Following the emergence and global spread of new variants, the 
Beta (B.1.351) variant strain was also introduced in the clinical development of the vaccine either as a 
monovalent (MV) vaccine (CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 [B.1.351] vaccine) or as a bivalent (BV) vaccine 
(CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 [D614 + B.1.351] vaccine). As part of an amendment to the VAT00002 Original 
Phase II Cohort, Supplemental Phase III Cohorts were incorporated into the study to evaluate the 
potential use of CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 vaccine to boost responses in individuals previously vaccinated 
with other platforms (2 mRNA-and 2 adenovirus-vectored COVID-19 vaccines).  
The clinical efficacy of VidPrevtyn Beta is intended to be inferred by immunobridging of immune 
responses to an authorised COVID-19 vaccine, for which vaccine efficacy has been established. 
2.5.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
VAT00001 is a Phase I/II, randomized, modified double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, first-
in-human, dose-ranging, multi-center study with a Sentinel Safety Cohort and Early Safety Data 
Review (ESDR) evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 recombinant protein vaccine 
formulations (with or without adjuvant) conducted in the United States in healthy seronegative adults 
18 years of age and older. 
This study was used as the basis of the selection of a 2-dose schedule, and the selection of the AS03 
adjuvant to proceed to the phase 3 efficacy trial for VidPrevtyn (D614) primary series. The dose of the 
vaccine was approximately 4-6 fold lower than planned. Intended doses were 5µg for the low dose and 
15µg for the high dose, while effective doses were 1.3µg and 2.6µg respectively. Study VAT00002 - 
Original Phase II Cohort was used to decide on progression to the Phase III efficacy study VAT00008 
and to select an antigen dose formulation for further clinical development of the primary series and 
booster. 
VAT00002, Phase II, randomized, modified double-blind, multi-center, dose-finding study conducted in 
adults 18 years of age and older to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of 2 
injections of 3 different antigen doses (effective doses of 5 μg, 10 μg, and 15 μg) of CoV2 preS dTM-
AS03 vaccine administered 21 days apart by intramuscular (IM) route. 
The primary immunogenicity objective was to assess the neutralising Ab profile 14 days after the last 
vaccination (up to D36) in SARS-CoV-2-naïve (hereafter referred to as “naïve”) participants from each 
study intervention group. The secondary immunogenicity objective was to assess the neutralising Ab 
profile of the vaccine at D22 in naïve and non-naïve participants. 
A total of 722 participants 18 years of age and older were randomized to one of the 3 dose groups in a 
1:1:1 ratio. 
Assessment report

Approximately 81% of the participants were from the US and 19% of participants were from Honduras. 
The racial origin of participants was mostly “White” (63.9% of participants), followed by “American 
Indian or Alaska Native” (9.2% of participants), “Black or African American” (7.8% of participants), 
and “Asian” (4.6% of participants). The study population was predominantly comprised of those of 
“Not Hispanic or Latino ethnicity” (71.4% of participants). 
Overall, the baseline demographics were similar across treatment groups, between age groups, and 
across the analysis populations. 
The number of participants included in each analysis population is provided below. Among the 721 
randomized participants from the FAS, 611 participants were included in the PPAS (295 participants 
aged 18-59 years and 361 participants aged ≥ 60 years): 201 participants in Group 1, 207 in Group 2, 
and 203 in Group 3. Of the PPAS, 521 participants were included in the PPAS Naïve-D01+D22 since 
they tested negative by the anti-S immunoassay on D01 serum sample, by the anti-N immunoassay on 
D01 and D22 serum samples, and by nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) on D01 and D22 
respiratory samples.

Table 2: Criteria for SARS-CoV-2 Naïve and Non-Naïve at D01 or both D01 and D22 timepoints in 
VAT00002 study - Original Phase II Cohort 
Primary and secondary immunogenicity objectives were determined from 521 participants included in 
the PPAS Naïve-D01+D22 analysis set (i.e., naïve participants) and 77 participants included in the 
PPAS Non-Naïve-D01/D22 analysis set (i.e., non-naïve participants) across the 3 dosages.  
The primary objective was to determine the neutralising Ab profile against the D614G variant at D36 in 
SARS-CoV-2 naïve participants.  
A summary of the neutralising Ab profile by dose group at D01 (pre-injection) and at D36 (14 days 
post-injection 2) is presented below. At baseline, geometric mean titres (GMTs) were below the LLOQ 
for all groups. At D36, the proportion of participants with ≥ 2 and 4-fold-rise in neutralising Ab titres 
were > 90% in both younger and older adult age groups (18 to 59 years and ≥ 60 years) and similar 
across treatment groups. The proportion of responders (defined as participants who had baseline 
values below LLOQ with quantifiable neutralising titre above assay LLOQ at D36) was equal to the 
participants with ≥ 2-fold-rise in neutralising Ab titres.

Table 3: VAT00002 - Original Phase II Cohort: Summary of Neutralising Ab Profile at D36 – PPAS Naïve 
D01+D22 
The GMTs were similar across treatment groups in the older age group (≥ 60 years) while in 
participants aged 18 to 59 years, GMTs increased across treatment groups with higher GMTs observed 
in the treatment groups with higher antigen dose (i.e., Group 3 presented the highest neutralising Ab 
levels). 
Higher neutralising Ab titres were observed in participants aged 18 to 59 years compared to older 
individuals (≥ 60 years). 
The secondary objective #1 was to determine the neutralising Ab profile against the D614G variant at 
D22 in naïve participants. At D22 (21 days post-injection 1), for each treatment group, minimal 
increase in neutralising Ab titres from baseline were observed in naïve participants. 
The secondary objective #2 was to determine the neutralising Ab profile against the D614G variant at 
D01, D22, and D36 in non-naïve participants.  
At baseline, a comparable level of neutralising Abs was observed across treatment groups. At D22, 
high levels of neutralising Abs were observed after a single injection for each of the 3 antigen dose

levels. At this timepoint, the percentage of participants with titres ≥ 2-fold-rise ranged between 
approximately 59% and 74% and the percentage of participants with ≥ 4-fold-rise, which was also 
similar to the percentage of responders, ranged between approximately 55% and 70% across the 3 
treatment groups.  
At D36, there was a general pattern of increase in the magnitude of the neutralising Ab titres from 
post injection 1 in the overall (18 years of age and older) non naïve population. The percentage of 
participants with titres ≥2-fold-rise ranged between approximately 91% and 100%. The proportion of 
responders, as well as the percentage of participants with ≥4-fold-rise, ranged between approximately 
86% and 96% across the 3 treatment groups. 
Table 4: VAT00002 - Original Phase II Cohort - Summary of Neutralising Ab Profile – PPAS Non Naïve-
D01/D22 
For booster vaccine, the magnitude of differences in cross-neutralising antibody responses to Beta 
(B.1.351) variant strain compared to homologous D614G strain was lower in non-naïve individuals 
compared to naïve individuals, suggesting that a booster vaccination may provide improved immune 
coverage against variants of concern. A lower antigen dose than proposed for naïve populations was 
considered appropriate for non-naïve individuals. The data suggested that a single injection of an 
antigen dose of 5 μg with AS03 adjuvant may be sufficient for boosting previously primed individuals.

The nucleoside-modified messenger RNA is formulated in lipid nanoparticles, which enable 
delivery of the non-replicating RNA into host cells to direct transient expression of the SARS-
CoV-2 S antigen. The mRNA codes for membrane-anchored, full-length S with two point 
mutations within the central helix. Mutation of these two amino acids to proline locks S in an 
antigenically preferred prefusion conformation.

•  Sample size 
The study was powered to estimate the proportion of participants (expected: 80%) with a given 
increase in the neutralising antibody titres (expected: 10 times) and its 95% CI with a given precision 
(set: half width of 7.8%). From these assumptions, 100 participants per group were planned, thus a 
total of 300 volunteers was to be randomised. 
•  Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
Proc PLAN from SAS was used to generate the randomization list 1:1:1 using block balanced and 
stratified by age ([18-64] years or ≥65 years) and site. 
An independent statistician was in charge to generate the randomization list and to store it in a secure 
location. 
Randomization was planned to be performed by the site staff using the centralized tool in the e-CRF 
just prior to the vaccine injection on D0 visit. 
The participants, investigating physician, the central laboratories performing antibodies analysis and 
the sponsor staff monitoring the trial at the study sites were not to be aware of the treatment 
received.  
The healthcare professional administrating the vaccine was planned to be aware of the treatment arm, 
as the vaccines required different preparation, therefore the injection was planned to be carried out by 
Assessment report

a person external to the study. 
•  Statistical methods 
The Statistical analysis plan (SAP) by the investigator was finalised prior to the database lock. A post-
hoc analysis plan was created by the Sponsor on the 14th of July 2022 as the basis of the analysis to 
support regulatory approval of the B.1.351 variant containing booster vaccine. The assessment below 
will mainly refer to the prespecified SAP; references to the post-hoc analysis plan are explicitly 
mentioned. 
Analysis Populations/Sets 
Intention to treat (ITT) population: all patients as randomised, regardless of the strategy received by 
the patient, except patient with positive or doubtful or missing nucleocapsid antibodies at baseline. 
Safety population: all patients as randomised who have received the boost dose of vaccine.  
Per protocol (PP) population: all patients randomised, treated without major protocol 
violations/deviations. 
Original protocol and Post-hoc analysis: All analyses will be performed in the Per-Protocol Analysis Set 
(PPAS). 
Primary Endpoint(s) / Primary Estimand(s) 
Original protocol/SAP: The main analysis was planned to be performed on the per protocol population. 
For each viral strains (D614 and B.1.351), proportion of participants with an increase rate in 
neutralising antibody titres against SARS-CoV-2 of at least 10 fold between D0 and D15 was planned 
to be calculated with it 2-sided 95% confidence interval (95%CI) using the exact Clopper-Pearson 
method. 
CSR: The primary endpoint was compared between the 3 groups by a Pearson Chi2 test. 
Post-hoc analysis:  Geometric mean of neutralising antibody titre (GMT) ratio against Omicron BA.1 
strain 28 days after booster vaccination between Sanofi B.1.351 and BNT162b2. Superiority will be 
demonstrated if the lower bound of the 95% CI > 1.2 for the ratio of the GMTs between B.1.351 
vaccine and BNT162b2 vaccine at D28 against the Omicron BA.1 strain. Two-sample t-test will be used 
to assess the superiority of GMT ratio of Sanofi B.1.351 and BNT162b2.  
Supplementary Analysis for Primary Endpoint 
The primary analysis was repeated in several subsets of the ITT population (ITT, ITT with available 
data, ITT with multiple imputation). 
Secondary Endpoints / Secondary Estimand(s) and Subgroup Analyses 
Post-hoc analysis: three secondary endpoints, conditional on the success of the primary objective: 
•  Difference of seroresponse rate between Sanofi B.1.351 and BNT162b2 against Omicron BA.1 
strain. 
•  GMT ratio between Sanofi B.1.351 and BNT162b2 against D614 strain. 
•  Difference of seroresponse rate between Sanofi B.1.351 and BNT162b2 against D614 strain. 
The seroresponse rate is defined as the percentage of participants with a 4-fold or greater rise in 
serum neutralisation titre at D28 relative to Baseline (D0).  
The same success criteria of superiority test will be applied for GMT difference of secondary endpoint 
with the lower bound of the 95% CI > 1.2. To declare the success of secondary endpoints of non-

inferiority, the lower bound of confidence interval of the seroresponse rate difference need to be >-
10%, the non-inferiority margin. 
Multiplicity 
All tests will be two-sided, and a p-value of <0.05 will be considered significant. No adjustment will be 
planned for multiplicity except for comparisons between groups in pairs for which a Bonferroni 
correction will be used. 
Post-hoc analysis: A significance level of 0.025 one-sided will be used for hypothesis testing defined 
above for primary and secondary objectives. To control the family-wise type-I-error rate, the 
hypothesis testing of secondary endpoints is conditional on the success of the primary objective. The 
testing of secondary endpoints will be sequentially based on above listed.

•  Baseline data 
The mean age (SD) of participants was similar between vaccine groups and in both the ITT and PP 
analysis sets: 40.4 (± 13.1) years and 40.6 (± 13.0) years, respectively. The overall proportion of 
females was lower than the one of males in the 2 analysis sets (about 40% of female participants) as 
well as in Group 2 and 3 (CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 [D614] and [B.1.351] booster vaccine groups). In 
Group 1 (Pfizer/BioNTech booster vaccine group), the proportion of females and males was balanced. 
The interval between the second dose of the primary series and the booster dose was 174 days 
(approximately 5.8 months) and was comparable across groups. The most common high-risk medical 
conditions associated with increased risk of severe COVID-19 were smoking, obesity, and 
hypertension. Those were equally distributed across treatment arms. 
The baseline demographics of participants’ whose samples were retested with the validated Monogram 
PsVN assay are comparable to those tested with the MNA (Revised PPAS MNA at D28). The mean age 
was comparable across groups with 41.4 and 40.4 years for VidPrevtyn Beta and COVID-19 mRNA 
vaccine (tozinameran), respectively. Age ranged from 20.0 to 69.0 years. The mean duration between 
the second dose of the primary series and the booster dose was comparable across groups, being 
171.0 and 174.5 days for VidPrevtyn Beta and COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (tozinameran), respectively 
•  Numbers analysed 
The safety population included 247 randomized and vaccinated participants. The ITT population 
comprises 242 randomized participants: 84 participants in CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (D614) booster group, 
78 participants in CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) booster group, and 80 participants in 
Pfizer/BioNTech booster group. Among them, 65 participants (26.9%) participated in the ancillary 
study (i.e. to assess the humoral and cellular responses): 24 participants in CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 
(D614) booster group, 23 participants in CoV2 preS dTMAS03 (B.1.351) booster group, and 18 
participants in Pfizer/BioNTech booster group.  
Overall, 223 participants were included in the PP population at D15: 76 participants in CoV2 preS dTM-
AS03 (D614) booster group, 71 participants in CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) booster group, and 76 
participants in Pfizer/BioNTech booster group. Of these, 61 participants (27.4%) participated in the 
ancillary study: 23 participants in CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (D614) booster group, 20 participants in CoV2 
preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) booster group, and 18 participants in Pfizer/BioNTech booster group.  
At D28, 208 participants were included in the PP population: 73 participants in CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 
(D614) booster group, 65 participants in CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) booster group, and 70 
participants in Pfizer/BioNTech booster group. 
Samples were re-tested with the validated monogram PsVN assay. The per-protocol analysis 
population included 143 participants receiving VidPrevtyn Beta (N=67) or COVID-19 mRNA vaccine 
(tozinameran) (N=76). 
•  Outcomes and estimation 
Post-hoc analysis - Validated Monogram PsVN assay results 
The below outcomes and estimations are presented based on the validated monograph PsVN assay in 
the revised PPAS. 
For the primary endpoint, the neutralising Ab geometric mean titre ratio (GMTR) against Omicron BA.1 
variant strain of CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) vaccine relative to Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was 2.53 
(95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.80; 3.57) which meets the superiority criterion of lower limit of the 2-
sided 95% CI of GMTR > 1.2 as shown in the below table.

For the secondary endpoints, the difference of neutralising seroresponse rate against Omicron BA.1 
variant strain between CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) vaccine and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was 3.8 
(95% CI: -3.9; 12.8) which meets the non-inferiority criterion of lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI of 
the difference > -10%, as shown in the table below.

The neutralising Ab GMTR against D614G strain of CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) vaccine relative to 
Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was 1.43 (95% CI: 1.06; 1.94) which does not meet the superiority criterion 
of lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI of GMTR > 1.2. The difference of neutralising seroresponse rate 
against D614G strain between CoV2 preS dTMAS03(B.1.351) vaccine and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was 
3.0 (95% CI: -6.9; 12.8) which meets the non-inferiority criterion of lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI 
of the difference > -10%, as shown in the below table.

Monogram at D28 
In addition to the VAT00013 study samples retesting for D614G and Omicron BA.1 variant strains, 
VAT00013 samples were tested for the Omicron BA.4/BA.5 variant strain using the validated 
Monogram PsVN assay.  
The Sanofi CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) booster vaccine induced 2.5-fold higher neutralising 
antibody titres against Omicron BA.4/5 than those induced by the Pfizer/BioNTech booster prototype 
vaccine in the fully validated Monogram PsVN assay, GMT ratio 2.5 (95% ci: 1.7; 3.67). 
Furthermore, the neutralising seroresponse rates observed with the Sanofi CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 
(B.1.351) vaccine at D28 was higher than those observed with Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine irrespective of 
the variant tested as shown in the below table.

Post-hoc analyses - non-validated microneutralisation assay results 
The below outcomes and estimations are presented based on the non-validated MNA in the PPAS. 
The primary objective of the post-hoc analyses was to compare neutralising Ab titres against the 
Omicron BA.1 strain 28 days after booster vaccination between the groups that received the CoV2 preS 
dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) and the Pfizer/BioNTech booster vaccine. In the PPAS-D28, the superiority of a 
booster dose of the CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) vaccine compared with the Pfizer/BioNTech 
vaccine was demonstrated using GMTs at D28. The neutralising Ab GMT ratio against the Omicron BA.1 
variant was 1.9 (95% CI: 1.4; 2.6), which meets the superiority criterion of the lower bound of the 
two-sided 95% CI of GMTR > 1.2, as shown in table below.

Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines with individual neutralising titre against Omicron BA.1 at D28 – PPAS 
The secondary objective of the post-hoc analyses related to the comparison of the neutralising 
seroresponse rate against Omicron BA.1, and the post-boosting neutralisation and seroresponse rate 
against wild-type D614G strain 28 days after booster vaccination between the groups receiving the 
CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines.

The difference of neutralising seroresponse rate against Omicron BA.1 variant strain between CoV2 
preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) vaccine and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was 13.6 (95% CI: 1.0; 25.8) which 
meets the non-inferiority criterion of lower limit of the 2 sided 95% CI of the difference > -10%. 
The neutralising Ab GMTR against D614G strain of CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) vaccine relative to 
Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was 1.8 (95% CI: 1.3; 2.6) which meets the superiority criterion of lower limit 
of the 2 sided 95% CI of GMTR > 1.2. The difference of neutralising seroresponse rate against D614G 
strain between CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) vaccine and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was 6.7 (95% CI: 
-3.8; 17.2) which meets the non-inferiority criterion of lower limit of the 2 sided 95% CI of the 
difference > -10%. 
The exploratory objectives of the post-hoc analyses (#4 and #5) were to assess post-booster 
neutralising Ab GMT ratios and post-booster differences of neutralising seroresponse rates between the 
3 pairs of booster vaccine by variant (Omicron BA.1, D614G, Beta, and Delta) at D15 and D28. 
Regardless of the variants tested, the neutralising Ab GMTs induced by a single booster injection of 
CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) vaccine at D28 were:  
•  Approximately twice to 3 times as high as those observed with Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine  
•  1.5 to approximately 3 times as high as those observed with CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (D614) 
vaccine  
The neutralising Ab GMTs for all variants observed with CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (D614) vaccine were 
similar to those of Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine with GMT ratios against the variants tested and between 
this pair of booster vaccines (CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 [D614] vaccine over Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine) 
ranging from 1.1 to 1.3 at D28. 
The neutralising seroresponse rate observed with CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) vaccine at D28 was 
higher than those observed with CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (D614) and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines, 
irrespective of the variant tested. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine presented higher neutralising 
seroresponse rates than CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (D614) vaccine for all variants except the Beta variant. 
Primary and secondary immunogenicity analysis 
The below outcomes and estimations are presented based on the non-validated MNA in the PPAS. 
Neutralising antibody response  
The primary objective of VAT00013 study was to assess the immunogenicity of each booster vaccine in 
adults previously primed with Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine by evaluating the number of participants with at 
least a 10-fold increase in neutralising Ab titres against D614 and B.1.351 strains from D0 to D15 after 
the booster dose.  
At D15, a higher proportion of participants with a 10-fold increase of neutralising Ab against D614G 
strain was observed in CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) booster group (76.1%) compared to CoV2 preS 
dTM-AS03 (D614) booster (55.3%) and Pfizer/BioNtech booster groups (63.2%). A statistically 
significant difference between the 3 groups is observed (p < 0.05).  
Against B.1.351 strain, the proportion of participants with a 10-fold increase of neutralising Ab was 
higher in CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) booster group compared to the other booster groups with > 
84% of participants having a 10-fold increase of neutralising Ab and a statistically significant difference 
between the 3 groups was observed (p < 0.0001).

Table 11: VAT00013: Proportion of participants with an increase of at least 10 fold in neutralising 
antibodies titres between D0 and D15 
The secondary objective #1 of VAT00013 study was to compare the increase in neutralising Ab titres 
with regard to age groups (18-64 years and > 65 years of age). However, as only 6 participants aged 
> 65 years were enrolled due to operational constraints (booster vaccination national campaign in 
France had already been launched at the time of the study conduct), the cut-off age for analysis was 
set at < 40 years old and ≥ 40 years old. Overall and regardless of the strain tested, the age did not 
have any impact on the 10-fold increased rates of neutralising Ab titres pre-booster dose to post-
booster at D15. 
The secondary objective #5 was to evaluate the immunogenicity of the 3 booster vaccines on VOCs 
(table below). Regardless of the variant strain tested, including B.1.1.529 variant (Omicron), the 
highest neutralising Ab titres at D15 and D28 were observed for CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) 
booster group. For both the 2 VOCs, Delta and Omicron (BA.1 subvariant), neutralising Ab titres 
induced in the CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) booster group were about twice as high as those 
observed for the 2 other booster groups. Increase in neutralising Ab titres against D614G, Beta, and 
Delta variants from D0 to D15 were comparable for CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (D614) and Pfizer/BioNTech 
booster groups. For the CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) booster group, the increase of neutralising Ab 
titres against Beta variant from D0 to D15 was higher than those observed for D614G and Delta 
variants (31.7-fold increase versus 21.4-fold and 21.7-fold increases, respectively).  
A markedly lower increase of neutralising Ab titres against Omicron (BA.1) variant from D0 to D15 was 
observed for all booster groups; however, this increase of neutralising Ab titres was substantially 
higher for CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) booster group versus CoV2 preS dTMAS03 (D614) booster 
and Pfizer/BioNTech booster groups (14.5-fold increase versus 5.5-fold and 7.3-fold increases, 
respectively). Similar patterns of neutralising Ab titres increase from D0 to D28 were observed. Against 
Omicron variant strain, about a 12-fold increase from D0 to D28 was observed for CoV2 preS dTM-
AS03 (B.1.351) booster group versus about 5.5-fold and 6-fold increase for CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 
(D614) booster and Pfizer/BioNTech booster groups, respectively.

Binding antibody response  
The secondary objective #3 was to assess the humoral immune response in each of the booster groups 
at D15 and D28 by measuring anti-S1 (D614) and anti-RBD (D614 and B.1.351) IgG levels expressed 
in BAU/mL. It should be noted that only anti-S1 results were available. In addition, an ancillary 
analysis was performed in a subset of participants to assess the early humoral response in the 3 
booster groups at D3 (secondary objective #8). Table below summarizes the results of anti-S1 Ab 
levels at D0, D3, D15 and D28. At D3, regardless of the booster group, there was no increased 
humoral response as anti-S1 levels remained in the same range from D0 pre-booster dose to D3 post-
booster dose. From D0 to D15, the increase in anti-S1 levels ranged from approximatively 7-fold for 
CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (D614) booster group to about 11-fold for CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) 
booster group. At D28, anti-S1 levels remained high in all the 3 booster groups with a slight decrease 
for the anti-S1 Ab levels fold-rise in Pfizer/BioNTech group from approximately 9-fold (D0 to D15) to 7-
fold (D0 to D28).

•  Ancillary analyses 
The secondary objective #9 was to explore the CD4 and CD8 cellular response for the 3 booster 
vaccines in an ancillary study using ELISpot assay. Overall, 61 participants (27.4%) from the PP 
population participated in the ancillary study: 23 participants in CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (D614) booster 
group, 20 participants in CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) booster group, and 18 participants in 
Pfizer/BioNTech booster group.  
In all booster groups, participants from this ancillary study mainly mounted cellular response for CD4+ 
T-cells (1.5-fold and 2-fold increase from D0 to D15) that secreted both interferon gamma (IFNγ) and 
interleukin (IL)-2 for D614G strain and IFNγ for Omicron BA.1. The fold increase of the cellular 
response for both D614G and Omicron strains from baseline to D15 post-booster was higher in CoV2 
preS dTM-AS03 (D614) and CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) booster groups than in Pfizer/BioNTech 
booster group. The proportion of participants with these CD4+ T-cells responses and the increase of 
these responses from D0 to D15 were remarkably higher in CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (D614) and CoV2 
preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) booster groups for both D614 and Omicron strains than Pfizer/BioNTech 
booster group. For Omicron strain, > 80% of participants showed cellular responses (CD4 IFNγ) for 
CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (D614) and CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) booster groups versus 
approximately 55% of participants for Pfizer/BioNTech booster group.

Criteria for Evidence of Prior SARS-CoV-2 Infection at Baseline and at Second Injection (for 
Comparator Group Only) 
The numbers and proportions of participants with unrecognized prior SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to 
booster dose in the intervention cohorts (booster cohorts) is currently not known. To further evaluate 
the potential impact of prior infection, the applicant has retrospectively evaluated the baseline samples 
of booster arms for the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein. 
•  Treatments 
The study design is aiming to assess the nAB immune response of a booster dose of the MV (B1.351) 
protein vaccine after priming with 2 different COVID-19 vaccine platforms, i.e. after priming with either 
2 mRNA or 2 Ad-vector COVID-19 vaccines. Moreover, a homologous protein booster is assessed.  
mRNA and Ad-vector primed groups 
In the Supplemental Phase III Cohort 2 part of study VAT00002 participants in the mRNA and Ad-
vector primed groups received either MV CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (5 μg B.1.351) or BV CoV2 preS dTM-
AS03 (2.5 μg D614 + 2.5 μg B.1.351) vaccines as a single booster injection. Participants were 
previously primed (4 to ≤10 months prior the booster injection) with one of the following vaccine 
candidates: 
•  2 COVID-19 mRNA vaccine candidates: BNT162b2: International Non-Proprietary Name 
(INN)-Tozinameran, COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (nucleoside-modified) from Pfizer/BioNTech, or 
mRNA-1273: INN-COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (nucleoside-modified) from Moderna 
•  2 adenovirus-vectored vaccine candidates (Ad-vector primed groups): ChAdOx1-nCOV-19: 
INN- COVID-19 vaccine (ChAdOx1-S [recombinant]) vaccine from Oxford 
University/AstraZeneca, or Ad26.COV2-S: INN- COVID-19 vaccine (Ad26.COV2-S 
[recombinant]) from Johnson & Johnson/Janssen 
Protein Primed Group 
Participants in the Protein primed vaccine group were previously primed (4 to ≤10 months prior the 
booster injection) with either 5 µg, 10 µg, or 15 µg antigen dose of CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (D614) 
vaccine in the VAT00002 Original Phase II Cohort. They received 1 dose of 5 μg antigen of either MV 
(D614) vaccine or MV (B.1.351) vaccine in Supplemental Cohort 2. 
Comparator group 
In the Comparator Group SARS-CoV-2 naïve, unvaccinated participants were to receive 2 injections of 
10 μg antigen dose of the CoV2 preS dTM MV (D614).

•  Sample size 
The study was powered to show that (1) the immune response induced by the booster vaccination 
(B.1.351 or D614 + B.1.351) is not inferior to the one generated by the priming series (D614); (2) the 
booster vaccine induces an immune response that is superior to that observed immediately before 
booster.  
The study design included co-primary endpoints (to be tested both for superiority and non-inferiority), 
sequential secondary endpoints and various treatment arms, so that several considerations and 
assumptions drove the sample size calculation, including: the control of the type 1 error, attrition 
rates, previous estimates on several immunogenicity parameters, stratification factors (age and primer 
vaccine). Overall, 2180 participants were included in cohort 2 main arms plus 515 participants in the 
comparator arm (i.e. primary series) as reflected in the table below.

Partial database lock is performed 
For  Supplemental  Cohort  2,  a  prespecified  independent  statistical  group  who  will  be  unblinded  at 
participant level was to generate interim outputs including tables, listings, and figures. The treatment 
code  was  to  be  masked  from  the  interim  outputs.  A  group  of  study  members  will  review  the  interim 
outputs unblinded at group level, to perform decision-making. Furthermore, the study team will remain 
blinded on data collected after date cut-off of the interim analysis. 
•  Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
All participants in the study were randomised to receive one of the three formulations of the CoV2 preS 
dTM-AS03 experimental vaccine, with no other vaccine or placebo to be used as external comparator. 
Randomisation of the participants into the supplemental cohorts study arms was planned to be 
stratified based on age, priming vaccine, exploratory vs. non-exploratory (“main”) arms, and high-risk 
medical condition. The Supplemental Cohort 2 Main Arm contained several subarms; in most cases, 
participants were assigned on a 1:1 ratio to the treatments available for their characteristics (possible 
subarms: CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) vs CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (D614 + B.1.351); CoV2 preS dTM-
AS03 (D614) vs CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351)). Younger adults (18-55 years) previously vaccinated 
with the protein-based vaccine in the Original Phase II Cohort were randomised on a 9:1 ratio to the 
D614 : B.1.351 vaccine formulations. Participants were only assigned to the Supplemental Cohort 2 
Exploratory Arm when a sufficient number of corresponding participants had been allocated to the 
main arms in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. The Supplemental Cohort Comparator Group was open-label, thus not 
randomised, and consisted of previously unvaccinated participants.

Table 18: Analysis set used in analyses
 Primary Endpoint(s) / Primary Estimand(s) 
Co-primary objectives regarding CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351): 
1)  To demonstrate in adults 18-55 years of age and previously vaccinated with the 
Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA COVID-19 vaccine that a booster dose of CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 
(B.1.351) induces an immune response that is non-inferior to the response induced by a two-
dose priming series with the CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (D614) vaccine in naïve, previously 
unvaccinated individuals. 
2)  To demonstrate in adults 18-55 years of age and previously vaccinated with the 
Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA COVID-19 vaccine that a booster dose of CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 
(B.1.351) induces an immune response that is superior to that observed immediately before 
booster. 
Endpoints: Individual serum neutralising titre at D01 and D15 against the B.1.351 variant for the CoV2 
preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351); individual serum neutralising titre against the D614G strain at D36 
(Comparator Group). 
Hypotheses: 
Primary objective 1: Non-inferiority to the comparator for participants primed with the Pfizer/BioNTech 
vaccine. The non-inferiority in terms of GMT will be demonstrated if the lower limit of the two-sided 
98.3% CI of the ratio of the GMT is greater than (1/1.5): 
Null hypothesis (H0) : GMT(booster) / GMT(comparator) ≤(1/1.5) 
Alternative hypothesis (H1) : GMT(booster) / GMT(comparator) > (1/1.5) 
Primary objective 2: superiority to pre-booster for participants primed with the Pfizer/BioNTech 
vaccine. The superiority will be demonstrated if the lower limit of the two-sided 98.3% CI of the ratio 
Assessment report  
EMA/893684/2022  
Page 73/185 
 
 
 
 
of serum neutralisation titre is greater than 2: 
Null hypothesis (H0) : Ratio (post-booster/pre-booster) ≤ 2 
Alternative hypothesis (H1) : Ratio (post-booster/pre-booster) > 2 
Due to the nature of immunogenicity titre, logarithm transformation of the individual data (titres or 
concentrations) (log10(data)) were to be calculated and assumed to be normally distributed. The 
statistical inference was to be based on the use of the two-sided 98.3% CI (Supplemental Cohorts 1 
and 2) for non-inferiority of difference in means of post-vaccination log10 transformed concentrations 
between the 2 groups with normal approximation. Confidence interval for the GMT ratio between 
booster arms and comparator group were to be calculated via Welch’s t-interval. Confidence interval 
for paired GMTR were to be used for the pre- vs. post-booster comparison (assumed normal 
approximation).  
The primary analysis was to be conducted in the PPAS. 
A sensitivity analysis was planned to be repeated in the FAS. 
Analyses of pooled primary series were planned only to be conducted if the number of evaluable 
Supplemental Phase III Cohorts Comparator Group participants is < 260 (i.e. power < 70% for the 
primary objectives).  
Subgroup analyses, were planned to be performed by age-group (18-55 years and ≥ 56 years) for 
intervention groups, by priming vaccine (Supplemental Cohorts 1 and 2), and by priming platform 
(Supplemental Cohorts 1 and 2), in addition to the Overall group. 
 Secondary Endpoints / Secondary Estimand(s) and Subgroup Analyses 
Conditional secondary objectives: 
1.1) non-inferiority to the comparator in participants primed with an mRNA vaccine; analysis 
method as above 
1.2) superiority to pre-booster in participants primed with an mRNA vaccine; analysis method 
as above 
2) superiority to the comparator in terms of GMT against B.1.351 (Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine 
only); analysis method as above 
3) non-inferiority in terms of seroresponse rate for participants primed with the 
Pfizer/BioNTech or mRNA vaccines (hierarchically). The non-inferiority will be demonstrated if 
the lower limit of the two-sided 98.3% CI of the difference between the 2 proportions is great 
than -10%: 
Null hypothesis (H0) : p(booster) - p(comparator) ≤ -10% 
Alternative hypothesis (H1) : p(booster) - p(comparator) > -10% 
Multiplicity 
Each supplemental cohort (testing the monovalent vaccines against D614, the monovalent vaccine 
against B.1.351 and the bivalent vaccine against both D614 and B.1.351, respectively) was tested 
one-sided at α/3 with α = 0.025. For the monovalent vaccine against B.1.351 (2nd row in figure 9.1 
from the study protocol), the two co-primary endpoints (non-inferiority of antibody titres in boosted vs. 
control group; superiority of antibody titres pre-booster vs. post-booster) were planned to be first 
tested in the Pfizer/BioNTech primed group, then, hierarchically in participants primed with an mRNA 
vaccine. Further secondary endpoints were tested hierarchically. The primary and secondary endpoints

are described above. 
Results 
•  Participant flow 
1326 participants received a booster dose of either MV CoV2 (B.1.351) vaccine or BV (D614 + 
B.1.351) vaccine. Overall, 705 participants previously primed with either an mRNA, Ad-vector, or with 
the MV CoV2 (D614) protein vaccine received a single booster dose of MV (B.1.351) vaccine and 621 
participants previously primed with either an mRNA or Ad-vector priming vaccine received a single 
booster dose of BV (D614 + B.1.351) vaccine. Participants were stratified by primary vaccine platform, 
booster vaccine received, and age (see table below).

prime/boost vaccine 
mRNA and Ad-vector primed group 
A total of 1248 participants primed with either mRNA or adenovirus-vectored priming platform received 
a single booster dose of either MV (B.1.351) or BV (D614 + B.1.351) vaccines in a 1:1 ratio. 627 
participants primed with either an mRNA or an Ad-vector vaccine received a single booster dose of 
(B.1.351) vaccine, 488 of them were 18-55 years and 139 ≥56 years. 378 participants were previously 
primed with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, 111 with the Moderna vaccine, 100 participants with 
Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, and 38 participants with J&J/Janssen. The majority of participants was 
18-55 years of age.  
Protein primed group 
In the Protein primed group, participants primed with CoV2 (D614) vaccine in the VAT00002 - Original 
Phase II Cohort were enrolled to receive a single booster dose of either MV (D614) or MV (B.1.351) 
vaccines. The Protein primed group participants were not randomized to receive the BV (D614 + 
B.1.351) booster vaccine. 
Overall, 78 participants from the FAS (4 aged 18-55 years and 74 aged ≥56 years) received the MV 
(B.1.351) vaccine. Among them, 23 (29.5%) participants were primed with 5 µg of MV (D614) vaccine, 
33 (42.3%) were primed with 10 µg of MV (D614) vaccine, and 22 (28.2%) were primed with 15 µg of 
MV (D614) vaccine. 4 participants were 18-55 years and 74 participants ≥56 years.

Comparator group 
In the Comparator Group, a total of 479 participants (463 aged 18-55 years, 16 aged ≥56 years) were 
enrolled to receive CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (D614) vaccine as a primary series vaccination of 2 injections 
given 21 days apart. Of those, 473 participants (459 aged 18-55 years, and 14 aged ≥56 years) 
received at least a study injection. 
For the data collection period of this report, the study duration for all Cohort 2 participants was 180 
days and the mean duration (standard deviation in the study) of participation was 144 (± 30.9) days. 
Disposition of participants ≥ 56 years 
Of the 615 participants in the PPAS who were boosted with the MV (B.1.351) vaccine, 180 participants 
were ≥ 56 years and of the 561 participants boosted with BV (D614 + B.1.351) vaccine 132 
participants were ≥56 years. 
Overall, 140 (10.5%) participants (all priming platforms including the protein vaccine platform 
together) were ≥65 years, including 88 (12.4%) participants in the MV (B.1.351) vaccine group and 52 
(8.3%) participants in BV (D614 + B.1.351) vaccine group. A more detailed overview for the age 
distribution of participants 65 years of age and older is provided in the below table.

Median interval between last priming dose and booster dose 
The median interval between the primary vaccination and the booster dose was comparable across 
participants who received MV (B.1.351) vaccine and those who received BV (D614 + B.1.351) vaccine. 
The median interval from the last injection of the primary series to receipt of booster injection was as 
5.98 months for the Oxford/AstraZeneca primed group, 6.64 months for the Pfizer/BioNTech, 7.36 
month for the Moderna, and 7.84 months for the J&J/Janssen primed groups. A slightly longer median 
interval of 8.21 months was reported for the Protein primed group.

of the Declaration of Helsinki. 
The protocol was amended several times. Protocol version 10.0 was valid on 20th January 2022. The 
current Interim CSR (up to date 43, version 1.0, dated 8 June 2022) is based on protocol version 10.0. 
All protocol versions have been provided together with an overview of the major protocol changes. 
•  Baseline data 
Most of the mRNA and Ad-vector primed participants were aged 18-55 years. The mean age (standard 
deviation [SD]) of participants was 46.0 (15.8) years for those boosted with MV CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 
(B.1.351) vaccine and 43.7 (14.3) years for those boosted with BV CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (D614 + 
B.1.351) vaccine. 
The distribution of participants in countries was similar between participants who received MV CoV2 
preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) vaccine and those who received BV CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (D614 + B.1.351) 
vaccine. The vast majority of participants primed with mRNA platform were from the US with about 
60% of participants, then from France (approximately 21% of participants), then from Spain, the 
United Kingdom (UK), and Australia. Those primed with Ad-vector priming platform were mainly from 
the UK (55% of all participants), then from the US (about 26% of participants), then France, Australia, 
and Spain. All Ad-vector-primed participants in the UK had been primed with Oxford/AstraZeneca 
vaccine while all Ad-vector-primed participants in the US were primed with the J&J/Janssen vaccine. 
In the per-protocol analysis population primed with mRNA vaccines and receiving VidPrevtyn Beta 
booster, the mean age of participants was 41.2 years (range 18-83 years); 347 (83.0%) were 18 to 55 
years of age, 71 (17.0%) were 56 years of age and older, 25 (6.0%) were 65 years of age and older. 
Among them, 44.0% were male, 56.0% were female, 67.7% were White, 13.2% were Black or African 
American, 2.6% were Asian, and 1.0% were American Indian or Alaska Native.  
In the per-protocol analysis population primed with adenoviral vector vaccines and receiving 
VidPrevtyn Beta booster, the mean age of participants was 50.4 years (range 24-77 years); 84 
(67.2%) were 18 to 55 years of age, 41 (32.8%) were 56 years of age and older, 17 (13.6%) were 65 
years of age and older. Among them, 52.8% were male, 47.2% were female, 78.4% were White, 
13.6% were Black or African American, 4.0 % were Asian, and 2.4% were American Indian or Alaska 
Native. 
The Protein primed group encompassed participants who were primed in the VAT00002 - Original 
Phase II Cohort that included 2 countries, the US and Honduras, and about half of participants who 
received MV CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) vaccine were from the US and the other half from 
Honduras (52.6% of participants and 47.4% of participants, respectively). 
Overall, in this Booster Cohort 2, the distribution of participants with different racial origins was similar 
between participants who received MV CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) vaccine and those who received 
BV CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (D614 + B.1.351) vaccine. Most participants were White (66.0% of 
participants), not Hispanic or Latino, and about 15% of participants were Black or African American. 
The other racial groups included Asian (3.5% of participants) and American Indian or Alaska Native 
(2.9% of participants). There was only one Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander participant. 
The most common high-risk medical conditions (≥ 5% of participants) were obesity, smoking, 
hypertension/high blood pressure, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
In the Comparator Group, among the 479 enrolled participants, a total of 473 participants (459 
participants aged 18-55 years and 14 participants aged ≥56 years) received at least a study injection. 
There were more males than females, with a male to female sex ratio of 1.25. The Comparator Group 
mostly included participants aged 18-55 years (16 participants aged ≥56 years were also randomized 
and among them, 14 were vaccinated) and the mean age (SD) of participants was 37.5 (± 11.2) years 
Assessment report

overall. More than half of the participants were from Australia (60.9% of participants) and the others 
were from the US (39.1% of participants). The most common high-risk medical conditions (> 5% of 
participants) were obesity, smoking, and hypertension/high blood pressure. 
•  Numbers analysed 
Population analysed in the PPAS for immunogenicity 
The PPAS included 615 participants boosted with MV CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) vaccine (435 
participants aged 18-55 years and 180 participants aged ≥56 years). The sample size for each 
intervention booster group was not balanced. The majority of participants were included in the 
Pfizer/BioNTech primed group. In more detail, the MV (B.1.351) booster cohort PPAS included: 
•  325 Pfizer/BioNTech primed adults: 279 aged 18-55 years and 46 aged ≥56 years 
•  93 Moderna primed adults: 68 aged 18-55 years and 25 aged ≥56 years 
•  94 Oxford/AstraZeneca primed adults: 62 aged 18-55 years and 32 aged ≥56 years 
•  31 J&J/Janssen primed adults: 22 aged 18-55 years and 9 aged ≥56 years 
•  72 Protein primed adults: 4 aged 18-55 years and 68 aged ≥56 years 
•  418 mRNA primed adults: 347 aged 18-55 years and 71 aged ≥56 years 
•  125 Ad-vector primed adults: 84 aged 18-55 years and 41 aged ≥56 years 
The BV (D614 + B.1.351) booster cohort PPAS included 561 participants, including 433 participants 
primed with mRNA platform (335 with Pfizer/BioNTec and 98 with Moderna) and 128 primed with 
Adeno-vectored platform (94 with Oxford/Astra Zeneca and 34 with J&J). 429 participants were 18-55 
years of age and 132 participants ≥56 years. 
Approximately 58% of participants in the PPAS of Booster Cohort 2 presented at least one high-risk 
medical condition: approximately 58% of participants boosted with MV CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) 
vaccine and 59% of participants boosted with BV CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (D614 + B.1.351) vaccine. Of 
the 220 (57.1%) participants in the PPAS who presented with at least one high-risk medical condition, 
213 participants were 18-55 years and 7 participants ≥56 years. An overview of all key booster group 
analysis sets by age and high-risk medical conditions is given the table below.

Table 21: Supplemental Phase III Cohort 2: Key analysis sets by age group, prior SARS-CoV-2 
infection at baseline and second injection, and high-risk medical condition group  
There is a high rate of follow-up. Overall, 60 (4.5%) Booster Group participants discontinued the 
study: 37 (4.9%) Pfizer/BioNTech primed, 12 (5.5%) Moderna primed, 5 (2.5%) Oxford/AstraZeneca 
primed, 4 (5.3%) J&J/Janssen primed, and 2 (2.6%) Protein primed. Protocol deviation was the most 
frequently reported reason in all Booster Groups (43 [3.2%] of participants). No Booster Group 
participants discontinued the study due to an adverse event. It should be noted, that 8 participants in 
the MV (B.1.351) booster group and 2 in the BV (D614+B.1.351) withdraw consent and the reason is 
unknown (i.e. withdrawal due to AEs cannot be excluded). Almost all enrolled participants received 
their booster dose, i.e. 99.7% of participants in the MV (B.1.351) and 99.4% in the BV 
(D614+B.1.351) vaccine booster cohort completed their booster dose. Overall, only 6 enrolled 
participants did not receive their booster dose. 
•  Outcomes and estimation 
Co-primary endpoints 
The two co-primary immunogenicity objectives were to demonstrate that a 5μg booster dose of MV 
CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) vaccine given to adults (18-55 years of age) previously vaccinated 
with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine induces an immune response against B.1.351 strain at D15 that is

•  non-inferior to the immune response against D614G strain induced by a 2-dose 10 μg primary 
series of CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (D614) vaccine in naïve individuals at day 36 (Comparator 
Group) 
•  Superior to that observed immediately before booster. 
Both co-primary objectives were met. For the age cohort 18-55 years of age and in an additional 
analysis for the cohort 18 years of age and older. 
For the first co-primary objective, the neutralising Ab geometric mean titre ratio (GMTR) of MV CoV2 
preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) vaccine booster dose in Pfizer/BioNTech primed participants aged 18-55 
years at D15 to the 2-dose primary series in the Comparator Group at D36 was 1.96 (98.3% 
confidence interval [CI]: 1.54; 2.50). This meets the non-inferiority criterion of lower limit of the 2-
sided 98.3% CI of GMTR > 0.667. Results are presented in the table below.

participants aged 18-55 years at D01 was 35.41 (98.3% CI: 26.71; 46.95), which meets the 
superiority criterion of lower limit of the 2-sided 98.3% CI of GMTR > 2. Results are shown in the table

Co-primary objectives-hypothesis testing in adults 18 years of age and older 
Both co-primary objectives including hypothesis testing were additionally analysed in the PPAS of 
adults 18 years of age and older. The same non-inferiority and superiority criterion as for the PPAS 18-
55 years of age applied. The results do not notably differ from the adult PPAS population 18-55 years 
of age. Both, the non-inferiority and the superiority criterion was met. The neutralising Ab GMTR of MV 
CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) vaccine booster dose in Pfizer/BioNTech primed participants aged 18 
years and older at D15 to the 2-dose primary series in the Comparator Group at D36 was 1.94 (98.3% 
CI: 1.54; 2.46), compared to 1.96 (98.3% confidence interval [CI]: 1.54; 2.50) in the 18-55 PPAS 
population. The geometric mean of individual ratio of post-booster neutralising ABs relative to pre-
booster was slightly higher in the PPAS 18 years of age and older compared to the PPAS 18-55 years 
of age. The geometric mean of individual ratio of post-booster neutralising Ab GMTs in the PPAS 18 
years of age and older at D15 relative to pre-booster neutralising Ab GMTs at D01 was 39.15 (98.3% 
CI: 30.03; 51.04) compared to 35.41 (98.3% CI: 26.71; 46.95) in the PPAS 18-55 years of age. 
Secondary immunogenicity with hypothesis testing 
The co-secondary immunogenicity objectives #1 and #2 were to demonstrate that a 5 μg booster dose 
of MV CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) vaccine given to adults (18-55 years of age) previously 
vaccinated with an mRNA vaccine induces an immune response against B.1.351 strain at D15 that is  
1)  non-inferior to the immune response against D614G strain induced by a 2-dose 10 μg primary 
series of CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (D614) vaccine in naïve individuals (Comparator Group) 
2)  superior to that observed immediately before booster. 
Non-inferiority and superiority criteria were met for individuals primed with any of the two mRNA 
vaccines (Pfizer/BioNTech and mRNA-1273/Moderna). 
The neutralising Ab GMTR of MV CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) vaccine booster dose in mRNA primed 
participants at D15 to the 2-dose primary series in the Comparator Group at D36 was 2.06 (98.3% CI: 
1.62; 2.61), which meets the non-inferiority criterion of lower limit of the 2-sided 98.3% CI of GMTR > 
0.667. The result is tabled below.

• 
in Pfizer/BioNTech primed (#4)

seroresponse rate is defined as participants responders with ≥4-fold-rise or greater in serum 
neutralisation titre [post/pre]. 
The differences of the seroresponse rate against B.1.351 strain in both Pfizer/BioNTech primed and 
mRNA primed participants following a booster dose of MV CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) vaccine 
versus seroresponse rate against D614G strain in Comparator Group were -16.58% (98.3% CI: -
22.99; -11.01) and -17.07% (98.3% CI: -22.79; -11.86), respectively. Therefore, these co-secondary 
objectives were not met, i.e., the lower limit of 2-sided 98.3% CI of the difference of seroresponse 
between groups was < -10%.

The study failed to demonstrate in participants 18-55 years that the seroresponse rate against B.1.351 
strain observed after a 5 μg booster dose of the MV (B.1.351) vaccine is non-inferior to that observed 
against D614G after 2 doses of MV (D614) vaccine. This is for both, Pfizer/BioNTech primed and mRNA 
primed adults. Among naïve individuals included in the Comparator group, the vaccination with MV 
(D614) induced a very high rate of seroresponse in participants 18-55 years of age, the proportion of 
participants in the Comparator exhibiting a 4-fold rise in neutralising titres to the D614G strain 14 days 
after the second dose was 99%. In previously primed individuals, although a booster dose may 
robustly restore the immune responses to levels notably higher than what is achieved following the 
primary series, the proportion achieving seroresponse of ≥4-fold increase might be limited by the 
(higher) baseline titres. The clinical relevance of seroresponse with regard to vaccine protection 
against SARS-CoV-2 is not clear. The assessment of nAB GMTs is deemed a (more) relevant parameter 
in the assessment of immune response after vaccination against COVID-19. The study is also limited in 
that the Comparator used was not an approved COVID-19 vaccine.  
Secondary immunogenicity: descriptive analysis: Post-booster versus pre-booster 
neutralising antibody profile 
Neutralising antibody GMTs post/pre-booster 
The descriptive analysis describes the neutralising Ab response against D614G and B.1.351 strains, 
induced by a 5µg booster dose of MV (B.1.351) vaccine by priming vaccine, priming platform and age 
group (18-55 years, ≥56 years, and all age groups). This analysis was conducted in the PPAS. 
A notable increase of neutralising antibodies against B.1.351 and D614 strains from pre-booster dose 
(Day 0) to post-booster dose (Day 15) is observed after a single 5µg dose of MV (B.1.351) vaccine for 
all tested priming vaccines/priming platforms. Neutralising antibody titre GMTs 14 days post booster 
dose are higher against D614 than against the B.1.351 strain irrespective of the priming 
vaccine/platform. Although post-booster neutralising Ab GMTs against D614G strain were higher than 
those observed against B.1.351 strain, post-/pre-booster GMTRs against B.1.351 strain were higher 
than those against D614G strain regardless of the priming vaccine/platform group. It should be noted, 
that in both age cohorts irrespective of the priming vaccine/priming platform baseline GMTs against 
the B.1.351 strain were lower compared to baseline GMTs against the D614 strain.  
Baseline GMTs against B.1.351 irrespective of age (i.e. for all ages) ranged from 260 (95% CI: 121; 
561) in the J&J primed vaccine group to 44.4 (95% CI: 32.6; 60.6) in the AZ primed vaccine group 
and against D614 from 1188 (95% CI: 874; 1615) in the Moderna primed vaccine group to 140 (95% 
CI: 99.1; 196) in the AZ primed vaccine group. The lower baseline GMTs against the B.1.351 strain

compared to the D614G strain as well as the different baseline GMTs in the different booster groups 
and age cohorts must be considered. This underlines the importance of considering the GMTRs. The 
increase of GMTRs against B.1.351 from pre-booster to 15 days post-booster dose irrespective of age 
ranged from approximatively 27-fold in the J&J primed group to 101-fold in the AZ primed group, and 
against the D614 strain from approximately 12-fold (95% CI: 8.72; 16.3) in the Moderna to 39-fold 
(95% CI: 28.2; 53.4) in the AZ primed vaccine group. GMTs on Day 15 against B.1.351 irrespective of 
age ranged from 9449 (95% CI: 7376; 12104) in the Moderna primed vaccine group to 4610 (95% CI: 
3689; 5760) in the AZ primed vaccine group and against D614 from 14240 (95% CI: 11257; 18013) 
in the Moderna primed vaccine group to 6817 (95% CI: 5453; 8521) in the AZ primed vaccine group. 
The highest increase of GMTs from pre-to post booster was observed in the protein primed group. 
GMTs against B.1.531 irrespective of age increased from 72.1 (95% CI: 48.5; 107) to 13300 (95% CI: 
9817; 18018) with a corresponding GMTR of 180 (95% CI: 109; 298). The GMTR against D614 is 148 
(95% CI: 85.8; 257) with an increase of the GMT from 164 (95% CI: 99.3; 271) on Day 0 to 25002 
(18441; 33897) on Day15. A comparable increase has previously been observed with a 5µg booster 
dose of MV CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (D614) after a 2-dose protein priming with 10µg of CoV2 preS dTM-
AS03 (D614). GMTs against D614 irrespective of age increased from 214 (95% CI: 127; 363) on Day 0 
to 24277 (95% CI: 18922; 31147), corresponding GMTR is 113. This means that the results of the 
booster immune response are reproducible for the two protein vaccines after homologous priming. This 
could support the thesis that the different immune response is rather related to the priming vaccine 
with its specific mode of action and composition than to differences in the study populations of 
homologous or heterologous primed individuals. GMTs and GMTRs by priming vaccines and priming 
platforms in all age groups are shown below.

MV CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) based on GMT and GMTR by priming vaccines and priming 
platforms in all age groups – PPAS 
A booster response to VidPrevtyn Beta was demonstrated regardless of the vaccine used for primary 
vaccination with the Geometric Mean Titres Ratio (GMTR, fold increase) 14 days post-booster relative 
to pre-booster against B.1.351 strain ranging from 38.5 to 72.3, and from 14.5 to 28.6 for D614G 
strain (Table 31). 
Seroresponse rates (≥4-fold-rise in neutralising Ab titres) 
In general, no clinically meaningful difference in seroresponse rates could be observed after a single 
booster dose of 5µg of MV (B.1.351) vaccine for the different priming vaccines/priming platforms. 
Seroresponse rates irrespective of age (i.e. considering all ages) in the three priming platforms ranged 
from 73.5% (68.9; 77.7) against D614G in the mRNA primed vaccine group to 90.6% (80.7; 96.5) for 
both the B1.351 and the D614G vaccine strain in the protein primed group. Comparable to what was 
observed with regard to GMTRs, the proportion of participants with ≥4-fold-rise in neutralising Ab titres 
was higher against the B.1.351 strain than that against D614G regardless of priming vaccine group 
and age group. An overview of seroresponse rates by priming vaccine/priming platform and by age 
groups in given in the table below.

Post-booster versus primary series neutralising antibody profile 
The neutralising Ab profile of a single booster dose of MV (B.1.351) vaccine by priming 
vaccines/platforms at Day 15 versus Comparator Group at Day36 is summarized based on neutralising 
Ab GMTs and seroresponse rates in participants aged 18-55 years and 18 years of age and older. 
Regardless of strain, age and priming vaccine/platform, the immune response induced by a single 
booster dose of MV (B.1.351) vaccine based on neutralising GMTs 14 days after booster dose was 
higher than the immune response at the same timepoint (i.e. 14 days post-dose 2) induced by a 2-
dose primary series of 10µg MV (D614G) vaccine in the comparator group. Baseline titres against the 
different strains varied by age cohort and by priming platform group. Baseline titres were the lowest in 
the comparator group which reflects the naive SARS-CoV-2 serostatus of the participants. Baseline 
titres, GMTs and GMTRs for B.1.351 and D614G by priming platform group and by age group (18-55 
years and 18 years of age and older) are tabled below. It should be noted that the majority of 
participants in the protein-primed group was older than 56 years of age. Only 4 participants were 18-
55 years of age.

GMTR in Monogram PVN assay by priming platform group and by age group (18-55 years and 18 years 
and older) - PPAS/PPAS Naïve at D01+D22 
Neutralising Ab GMTs against the D614G strain in mRNA and Ad-vector priming vaccine/platform was 
about 2 to 3-fold higher than neutralising Ab GMTs against D614G strain in the Comparator Group. For 
the Protein primed group, neutralising Ab GMT against D614G strain were even about 10-fold higher 
that that observed in the Comparator Group. Respectively, GMTs against the B.1.351 strain were about 
15 to 19-fold higher in the mRNA and the Ad-vector primed booster cohorts compared to the 
comparator group and about 37-fold higher in the protein primed group compared with the comparator 
group.  
In contrast to GMTs, the seroresponse rates were lower in the booster groups compared with the 
comparator group. In the comparator group 99.0% of the participants aged 18-55 years showed a 
response ≥4-foldrise in neutralising Abs at D36. The difference between the post-booster neutralising 
Ab seroresponse rate in the booster groups against D614G strain versus the seroresponse rate in the 
Comparator Group ranged from -35.4% (95% CI: -56.1; -18.6) for the J&J/Janssen primed group to -
9.9% (95% CI: -20.8; -3.8) for the Oxford/AstraZeneca primed group. Against the B.1.351 strain, the 
difference ranged from -15.1% (95% CI: -36.8; 0.3) for the J&J/Janssen primed group to 9.9% (95% 
CI: 0.8; 15.0) in the Oxford/AstraZeneca primed group, respectively. This can be explained by the high 
seroresponse in the comparator group due to the naïve serostatus of participants.

Immune response by age 
Disposition 
Of the 615 participants boosted with MV (B.1.351) 180 participants were ≥56 years and of the 561 
participants boosted with BV (D614 + B.1.351) vaccine 132 participants were ≥56 years. 
Overall, 140 (10.5%) participants (all priming platforms including the protein vaccine platform 
together) were ≥65 years, including 88 (12.4%) participants in the MV (B.1.351) vaccine group and 52 
(8.3%) participants in BV (D614 + B.1.351) vaccine group. A more detailed overview for the age 
distribution of participants 65 years of age and older is provided in below. 
Table 32: Number and percentage of elderly participants by priming vaccine and randomized group for 
VAT00002 Booster Cohort 2 and Comparator Group - Participants with Data in CRF 
The primary analysis of the 2 co-primary immunogenicity objectives has been performed in individuals 
18-55 years of age. However, a secondary analysis with the same statistical methods has been 
performed in the entire age population 18 years of age and older. Both the non-inferiority and the 
superiority criterion was met for the entire age population. Details are described in the co-primary 
objective section. 
The applicant submitted subsequently an additional analysis of the 2 co-primary objectives in 
Pfizer/BioNTech primed participants aged ≥56 years for both the non-inferiority versus the Comparator 
Group (aged 18-55 years) and the superiority of post-booster versus pre-booster recognizing that this 
is an additional analysis with limited sample size of participants aged ≥56 years. Both, the non-
inferiority and the superiority criteria were met. The neutralising Ab GMTR of a MV (B.1.351) vaccine 
booster dose in Pfizer/BioNTech primed participants aged 56 years and older in the PPAS at D15 to the 
2-dose primary series in the Comparator Group aged 18-55 years in PPAS Naïve at D01+D22 at D36 
was 1.69 (98.3% CI: 1.03; 2.76). This meets the non-inferiority criterion of lower limit of the 2-sided 
98.3% CI of GMTR > 0.667. The GMTR of post-booster neutralising Ab GMTs at D15 relative to pre-
booster neutralising Ab GMTs at D01 in the PPAS was 71.20 (98.3% CI: 33.20; 152.71), which meets 
the superiority criterion of lower limit of the 2-sided 98.3% CI of GMTR > 2. 
The applicant provided subsequently a strain-to-strain comparison for adults ≥56 years of age. 
Similarly as in participants aged 18-55 years, regardless of the strain-to-strain comparison, the 
immune response induced by a booster dose of MV (B.1.351) vaccine in participants aged ≥56 years 
and older based on neutralising GMTs was with one exception higher than the immune response 
induced by a 2-dose primary series of CoV2 (D614G) vaccine in participants aged 18-55 years. This 
was irrespective of the priming vaccine/platform. The only exception was the strain comparison 
B.1.351 vs D614G with an GMTR of 0.85 (0.52; 1.38).  
Assessment report

The proportion of participants ≥65 years of age is rather limited. The descriptive GMTs and GMTRs 
provided for participants ≥65 years of age for each priming vaccine including the protein primed group 
indicate notable GMTs and GMTRs for all priming vaccine groups.  
Immune response in individuals with high-risk medical conditions 
The immune response in individuals with high-risk medical conditions was pre-specified in the protocol 
and assessed within exploratory objective #7. Approximately 58% of participants in the PPAS of 
Booster Cohort 2 presented at least one high-risk medical condition, approximately 58% of participants 
boosted with MV (B.1.351) and 59% of participants boosted with BV (D614 + B.1.351) vaccine. The 
most common high-risk medical conditions (≥5% of participants) were obesity, hypertension/high 
blood pressure, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
Notable GMTRs could be observed in individuals with high-risk medical conditions after boosting with 
either MV (B.1.351) or BV (D614+B.1.351) across both age cohorts and irrespective of priming 
platform/priming vaccine. In individuals 18-55 years of age in the Pfizer/BioNTech primed vaccine 
group the MV (B.1.351) vaccine tended to induce higher GMTs 14 days post booster against the D614G 
and the B.1.3512 strain compared with the BV (D614+B.1.351) vaccine. It should be noted that 
baseline titres in the MV (B.1.351) vaccine group were slightly higher than in the BV (D614+B.1.351) 
vaccine group. GMTs against D614G on Day 15 were 11686 (9797; 13940) versus 8270 (7210; 9485) 
in the MV (B.1.351) and the BV (D614+B.1.351) vaccine group, and 8183 (6799; 9848) versus 4983 
(4310; 5761) against B.1.351, respectively. GMTRs against D614G in the MV vaccine group was 16.2 
(11.8; 22.2) in the MV (B.1.351) vaccine group and 14.3 (10.8; 18.9) in the BV (D614+B.1.351) 
vaccine group. GMTRs against B.1.351 were 36.5 (25.7; 52.0) versus 34.5 (24.7; 48.1), respectively. 
This finding was also observed for the GMTRs against both strains in the older adult cohort ≥56 years 
with high-risk medical conditions, were GMTRs against D614 G were 37.5 (16.2; 86.8) versus 18.2 
(9.62; 34.3) and against B.1.351 94.5 (41.9; 213) versus 29.5 (14.8; 58.8). This observation is not 
observed in individuals without high-risk medical conditions and it is not observed in the Ad-vector 
primed vaccine groups. In the Moderna primed vaccine groups it is observed against the B.1.351 strain 
in both age cohorts, but against D614 only in the older age cohort. 
Neutralising antibody titres against variant of concern (VoC) 
Neutralising Ab response against VoC (exploratory objective #5) were assessed in different populations 
for different VoC and with different assays. 
Methodology and populations tested  
Delta variant 
The neutralising Ab response against the SARS-CoV-2 Delta (B.1.617.2) variant strain was assessed in 
the whole Protein primed vaccine group (not only in a subset) boosted with the MV CoV2 preS dTM-
AS03 (B.1.351) vaccine and in the Comparator Group. The immune response in the 2 groups has been

neutralising Ab response against Delta variant testing on Pfizer primed adults aged 18-55 years 
boosted with either both MV CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) and BV CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (D614 + 
B.1.351) vaccines was analysed in the Variant Testing Subset (VTS) and the Variant Testing Subset 
Analysis Set, which is a subset of the VTS. The VTAS was designed in order to know the per-protocol 
participants immunogenicity response. The immune response in the Pfizer/BioNTech primed group was 
not compared to the Comparator group.

neutralising Ab titres against different Omicron subvariants (BA.1, BA.2, and BA.4) has been 
performed. The random selection included samples from 20 adults 18-55 years of age and from 10 
adults 56 years of age and older. No results for the immune response induced against BA.4 after a 
booster dose of the MV (D614) vaccine are available. The immune response against BA.4 after a MV 
(B1.351) or BV (D614+B.1.351) booster dose has been assessed.

Results 
Delta variant - Protein primed group and Comparator Group  
At day 15, the GMT against the Delta variant was approximately 8-fold higher in the Protein primed 
group boosted with the 5µg MV (B.1.351) vaccine than on day 36 in the Comparator Group primed 
with 2 doses of 10µg of MV (D614) vaccine. Post-booster GMTs against Delta variant increased by 
approximately 115-fold compared to baseline in the Protein Primed group versus 82-fold increase in 
Comparator group from baseline to post-primary series. Neutralising Ab seroresponse rates against the 
Delta strain in the Protein primed group were comparable to those observed in the Comparator group, 
i.e. 91.5% (82.5; 96.8) versus 96.4% (93.6; 98.2). When comparing the antibody response it should 
be noted, that baseline titres against the Delta strain were different in the 2 groups, i.e. 28.9 (19.5; 
43.0) in the Protein primed and 5.13 (4.97; 5.30) in the Comparator group. Moreover, the sample size 
was notably smaller in the Protein Primed versus the Comparator group, i.e. 72 participants with 
available values versus 307 for the GMT on day 15/ day 36. Results for GMTs, GMTRs and 
seroresponse rates against the delta and the D614 strain are shown below.

Delta variant - Pfizer primed group: neutralising antibody response after boosting with either MV 
(B1.351) or BV (D614+B.1.351) 
The sample size of the analysis performed in VTAS for Pfizer primed participants 18-55 years of age 
was limited to only 13 participants boosted with MV CoV2 (B.1.351) vaccine and 9 participants boosted 
with BV CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (D614 + B.1.351) vaccine. For both the MV CoV2 preS (B.1.351) and 
the BV (D614 + B.1.351) vaccine, baseline and D15 post-booster antibody titres against the delta 
strain were lower than those against D614G variant strain. Likewise, GMTRs in the MV (B1.351) and in 
the BV (D614+B1.351) vaccine group against the Delta strain, though within the same range tended to 
be numerically lower than those against D614. The MV (B1.351) vaccine tended to induce slightly 
higher neutralising antibodies on day 15 compared with the BV (D614+B1.351) against both strains, 
D614 and the delta strain. Results are shown in the table below. Similar results were observed in the 
VTS.

Omicron variants 
Results with regard to the immune response after a booster dose of the MV (B.1.351) and the BV 
(D614+B.1.351) vaccine against the Omicron subvariants BA.1, BA.2, and BA.4 are limited. A random 
selection of samples from 20 adults 18-55 years of age and 10 older adults ≥56 years primed with the 
Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine were included for testing a booster dose of each formulation, i.e. for MV 
(D614), BMV (B.1.351), and BV (D614+B.1.351). For each substrain results from 3 different assays 
performed in 3 different laboratories are available, as summarised below. Information regarding the 
assays used is described in the clinical pharmacology section.  
The results for all omicron subvariants for both age cohorts and all assays used for assessment are 
shown below.

All 3 booster vaccines, i.e. MV (B.1.351), BV (D614+B.1.531), MV (D614) induced in the small sub-
populations tested notable increases in neutralising titres to all Omicron subvariants in younger and 
older adults primed with Pfizer/BioNTech on D15, when compared to pre-boost levels (D01). GMTs 
tended to be lower in the older age cohort. A direct and systematically comparison of the immune 
response against each Omicron subvariant (BA.1; BA.2; BA.4) for the 3 formulations MV (D614), MV 
(B.1.351) and BV (D614+B1.351) has not been performed. Comparison of the three formulations in 
light of the data presented is impeded by the fact that the assessment of immunogenicity was 
performed in different laboratories. Moreover, the subset of participants for the evaluation is small, and 
the baseline Ab levels are different against the different sub-strains and different in each booster 
vaccine group. The difference in baseline antibody titres is likely due to pre-existing immunity either 
induced by the primary vaccination or natural infection prior to booster administration (i.e. between 
day 1 and booster). No immunogenicity data assessing the nAB immune response against Omicron 
sub-variants are available for priming vaccines different from Pfizer/BioNTech.

•  Sample size 
A total of 10 160 participants in Stage 1 and 10 886 participants in Stage 2 are planned to be enrolled 
and randomized with allocation ratio (1:1) into vaccine group and placebo group. Among those, up to 
3048 participants in Stage 1 and 3266 participants in Stage 2 (approximately 30% proportion of each 
stage population) will be SARS-CoV-2 non-naïve. While the target of 30% of SARS-CoV-2 non-naïves 
may or may not be reached, the study will aim at capping the representation of SARS-CoV-2 non 
naïves to a maximum of 30%, to secure the sample size in the SARS-CoV-2 naïve population to 
demonstrate vaccine efficacy in each stage. To that end, the sample size of at least 7112 SARS-CoV-2 
naïve participants in Stage 1 and 7620 SARS-CoV-2 naïve participants in Stage 2 is powered 
independently to demonstrate the primary objective of VE against symptomatic COVID-19 in SARS 
CoV-2 naïve adults in each stage. 
Assumptions for sample size calculation are listed as follows: 
•  The LB of adjusted CI for the VE estimate is > 30% for both stages 
•  The expected true VE for symptomatic COVID-19 is 70% 
•  The 1-sided type I error for each stage is 0.025 with the sample size calculated based on 
adjusted alpha of 1-sided 0.02276 for final analysis including one interim at 70% data 
•  Power = 90% for each stage 
Each stage is considered as independent of the other so that the type I error is controlled for each 
stage but not for the study. While the above assumptions remain the same for each stage of the study, 
the following assumptions are different for both stages because Stage 2 is expected to start after 
Stage 1. 
•  The incidence rate of symptomatic COVID-19 in Placebo is assumed as 2.25% illness rate in 
Stage 1 and 2.25% illness rate in Stage 2, per 2-months follow-up period 
•  Attrition rate = 25% in Stage 1 and 30% in Stage 2 
Assessment report  
EMA/893684/2022  
Page 101/185 
 
 
 
 
For each stage, the type I error of hypothesis testing is controlled as 1-sided 0.025, and O'Brien 
Fleming (OBF) spending function is applied to adjust for multiplicity of interim analysis for efficacy with 
one potential interim analysis when accrual of approximately 50%-70% of the total number of events 
is reached (see Section 9.5). The sample size calculated based on the adjusted final alpha of 0.02276 
will ensure at least 90% power to conclude on primary objective when the interim analysis is 
conducted between 50% - 70% range of data. Adjusted alpha by OBF alpha spending function is 
applied and the corresponding adjusted CI will be used for hypothesis testing at each interim and at 
final analysis against symptomatic COVID-19 in each stage independently. 
In each stage, with assumptions described above, a total of approximately 78 symptomatic COVID-19 
events are required. The expected follow-up time to accrue the required number of events for 90% 
power is approximately 2 months post-second dose, given the incidence rate assumption in each stage 
respectively. However, the number of events may be reached earlier or later than the assumed 2-
month period. 
It is considered success for the key secondary endpoints if the LB of the CI for the corresponding VE is 
> 0% against either the SARS-CoV-2 infection endpoint, or severe COVID-19. The Holm’s procedure 
(19) will be applied to control the overall 1-sided alpha 0.025 against key secondary objectives. 
Assuming the VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection endpoint is at least 40%, a total of 162 infections will 
have at least 80% power to conclude at 0% LB. Assuming the VE against severe COVID-19 is 80%, a 
total of 22 events will provide at least 80% power to conclude at 0% LB. 
The study is planned to have 5080 participants in the vaccine group in Stage 1 which will provide at 
least 92.1% probability to detect an event with 0.05% rate. In Stage 2, 5443 participants in vaccine 
group will provide at least 93.4% probability to detect an event with 0.05% rate.

•  Randomisation and blinding 
On the day of enrolment participants will be tested for presence of SARS-COV-2 antibodies using a 
rapid serodiagnostic test. Participants who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and sign the informed 
consent form (ICF) were randomly assigned to one of the study groups (vaccine versus placebo) with 
randomization ratio 1:1 in either Stage 1 only or Stage 2 only. In the event that the enrolment in 
Stage 1 overlaps with enrolment of Stage 2, an independent randomization of 1:1 will be applied to 
assign participants enrolled at that period to one of vaccine candidate groups and their matched 
placebo group. There will be no sharing of the placebo participants between the 2 stages. Stratified 
permuted block randomization will be applied for study group randomization where strata are age 
group (18-59 years and ≥60 years), baseline SARS-CoV-2 rapid serodiagnostic test positivity

(Positive/Negative), and sites. Participants who are positive by the rapid serodiagnostic test will be 
included in the study until a trigger is reached indicating an anticipated proportion of SARS-COV-2 non-
naïve individuals of approximately 30% at the end of enrolment 
The study will be performed in a modified double-blind (observer-blind) fashion: 
• 
Investigators and study staff who conduct the safety assessment and monitoring for efficacy 
and the participant will not know which vaccine is administered in order to decrease the risk of 
potential bias. Study site staff who administer the vaccine may also be blinded if they are not 
involved in preparation of the vaccine. 
•  Only the study site staff who prepare and administer the vaccine and are not involved with the 
safety and efficacy evaluation will know which vaccine is administered 
•  Testing laboratories will be blinded 
•  Statistical methods

Subset of the SafAS and comprising all participants who received at

Efficacy - Hypotheses and vaccine efficacy (VE) estimation 
Hypothesis testing was conducted for the primary efficacy objective. The success criteria for 
demonstration of efficacy included: 1) the lower bound of confidence interval (CI) is > 30%, and 2) the 
point estimate of VE is > 50%. 
Hypothesis testing for key secondary objectives were to be conducted when both of the following 
conditions were met:  
•  The primary objective was demonstrated 
•  22 severe COVID-19 cases and 162 infections were collected 
Yet, fewer than 22 severe COVID-19 cases were reported and thus, hypothesis testing was not 
conducted for assessing efficacy against severe COVID-19 in participants regardless of prior SARS CoV-
2 infection. Hypothesis testing for key secondary efficacy objective was only conducted for assessing 
the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection in SARS-CoV-2 naïve participants. The efficacy was considered 
as demonstrated if the lower bound of 95% CI (exact method) was greater than 0%.  
Analyses for the other efficacy objectives are descriptive. Analyses of the primary safety objectives, 
other secondary objectives, and exploratory objectives are descriptive. 
Primary objective 
The hypothesis testing of VE against the primary endpoint of symptomatic COVID-19 was as follows: 
H0: VE ≤ 30% 
HA: VE > 30% 
The point estimate of VE was calculated by the incidence rate ratio (IRR): 
where CV and CP represent the cases in vaccine group and placebo group respectively; PYV and PYP 
represent total # of 1000 person-years in vaccine group and placebo group, respectively. The CI for VE 
was calculated by an exact method assuming a binomial distribution of the number of cases in vaccine 
group conditional on the total number of cases in the study. As a sensitivity analysis for primary 
objective, the point estimate of VE was based on relative risk (RR) of COVID-19 case occurrence 
shown below: 
and placebo group respectively; NV and NP represent total # of participants in vaccine group and 
placebo group, respectively. The CI of VE by RR was calculated with the same method as described 
above for the CI of VE by IRR by replacing the 1000 person-years to number of participants at risk in 
the denominators, respectively. 
where CV and CP represent the cases in vaccine group

Sensitivity Analysis 1 
Sensitivity analysis against symptomatic COVID-19 was conducted with VE calculated by RR (Formula 
2) in addition to person-year approach in the mFAS-PD2. 
Sensitivity Analysis 2 
Sensitivity analysis against symptomatic COVID-19 was conducted in the PPAS. 
Both the mFAS-PD2 and PPAS capture endpoints occurring during the most relevant follow-up period 
(i.e., after 2 weeks from last immunization, allowing sufficient time for adequate adaptive immune 
responses to be elicited by the vaccine). The mFAS-PD2 is considered to better preserve the benefits of 
randomization compared to the PPAS, and it is also considered to approximate better to what may 
occur in real conditions external to the study (closer to an intent-to-treat population). The PPAS is 
expected to provide an estimate of the vaccine performance reflective of ideal conditions. 
Survival Analysis 
In addition to the hypothesis testing based on IRR, survival analyses based on Stratified Cox 
proportional hazard (PH) model were used to estimate the VE by one minus the hazard ratio (HR) 
(vaccine versus placebo), with score-based CI, as a supportive analysis. Specifically, Stratified Cox 
model used separate baseline strata of different age group, sex, high-risk medical condition group, and 
serostatus at D22. In addition to Cox model, Kaplan-Meier curves were also applied with 95% CI 
calculated by Greenwood formula. 
Survival analysis was conducted in the mFAS-PD2 and PPAS analysis sets. 
Key secondary objective (prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection in SARS-CoV-2 naïve participants) 
The following hypotheses were tested for the key secondary efficacy objective of SARS-CoV-2 
infection: 
H0: VE ≤ 0% 
HA: VE > 0% 
The VE of SARS-CoV-2 infection is computed by RR (Formula 2) and CI by exact binomial method (see 
above for primary efficacy objective). The RR is used for evaluating SARS-CoV-2 infection as the 
ascertainment of serological infection using blood samples collected at serial intervals does not enable 
robust assessments of person-time at risk for each individual. 
Dates of data analyses 
The number of primary endpoint events was reached on March 15, 2022. This triggered the primary 
analysis on the primary endpoint based on a data extraction performed on 9 June 2022 with data cut-
off date of March 15, 2022 (i.e., all primary endpoint events with events' start date earlier than March 
15, 2022 were included in the primary analysis at this time). 
All analyses (including hypothesis testing of primary and secondary efficacy; secondary and 
exploratory efficacy analyses, sensitivity analysis on the primary endpoint and safety analysis) 
presented in this report correspond to data extracted on June 9, 2022. All adjudicated cases in the 
database at the time of data extraction were considered for the efficacy analyses. These primary 
analyses were conducted to support the registration of vaccine candidates in response to the ongoing 
pandemic and were based on data that were cleaned and quality checked to the fullest extent possible. 
However, data were not locked, thus the database continues to be updated following ongoing data 
collection. 
Assessment report  
EMA/893684/2022

To include more updated data on sequencing data, a subsequent data extraction was performed on 
June 29, with the same data cut-off date (i.e., March 15, 2022). Only the efficacy tables related to 
variant-specific efficacy were re-analysed after this data extraction. There were no re-analyses of the 
primary and secondary efficacy objectives. 
Changes in Planned Analyses Prior to Unblinding or Database Clean 
Because Omicron is the prevalent variant during case accrual for Stage 2 and the expected vaccine 
efficacy against Omicron is expected to be lower than the original assumption of 70%, the expected 
true VE for symptomatic COVID-19 for Stage 2 was estimated at 60%. Therefore, a total of 
approximately 125 symptomatic COVID-19 events will be required to achieve 80% power with 1-side 
type I error rate of 0.025, assuming no interim analysis. If any interim analysis is planned for Stage 2, 
type I error rate will be adjusted appropriately.

•  Conduct of the study 
According to the Applicant, VAT00008 was conducted according to GCP Guidelines and current version 
of the Declaration of Helsinki. 
The protocol was amended several times. The brief CSR (version 1.0, dated 21 July 2022) was 
submitted. All protocol versions have been provided together with an overview of the major protocol 
changes. 
•  Baseline data 
Out of the 13002 randomized participants, 12924 (99.4%) were included in the Full Analysis Set 
(FAS); 78 participants did not receive any injection and were, therefore, excluded from this analysis 
set.  
In the FAS, 1176 participants were naïve at D01 and 683 participants were naïve at D01 and D22, 
9693 participants were non-naïve at D01, and 10966 participants were non-naïve at D01 or D22. A 
total of 2055 participants had an undetermined status at D01 and 1275 participants had an 
undetermined status at D22. Among the 12924 participants in the FAS, the Modified Full Analysis Set 
post-dose 1 (mFASPD1) included a total of 12809 participants (6418 [99.2%] in the Vaccine Group and 
6391 [99.1%] in the Placebo Group). Among the 1176 participants naïve at D01 in the FAS, 1153 
(98.0%) participants were in the mFAS-PD1 population. Among the 9693 participants non-naïve at 
D01 and in the FAS, 9619 (99.2%) were in the mFAS-PD1 population. 
Among the 12924 participants in the FAS, the Modified Full Analysis Set post-dose 2 (mFAS-PD2) 
included a total of 11416 participants (5736 [88.6%] in the Vaccine Group and 5680 [88.0%] in the 
Placebo Group).  
Of the 683 participants in the FAS who were naïve at D01 and D22, 670 (98.1%) participants were in 
the mFAS-PD2. Among the 10966 participants non-naïve at D01 or D22 in the FAS, 9659 (88.1%) 
participants were in the mFAS-PD2 analysis set. 
The longest duration of the follow-up post-dose 2 for participants in mFAS-PD2 aged 18 to 59 years 
was 118 days for each the Vaccine Group and the Placebo Group, and the median participant duration 
of the follow-up post-dose 2 was 58 days for each the Vaccine Group and the Placebo Group. For 
participants aged ≥ 60 years, the longest duration of the follow-up post-dose 2 was 104 days, 100 
days for the Vaccine Group and 104 days for the Placebo Group, and the median participant duration of 
the follow-up post-dose 2 was 54 days for the Vaccine Group and 54 days for the Placebo Group. For 
participants aged ≥65 years, the longest duration of the follow-up post-dose 2 was 100 days for each 
the Vaccine Group and the Placebo Group, and the median participant duration of the follow-up post-
dose 2 was 56 days for each the Vaccine Group and 51 days for the Placebo Group. 
The Per-Protocol Analysis Set (PPAS), which is a subset of the mFAS-PD2, included a total of 10489 
(91.9%) participants (5257 [91.6%] in the Vaccine Group and 5232 [92.1%] in the Placebo Group) out 
of the 11416 participants in the mFAS-PD2. Most exclusions (926 [8.1%] participants) from the PPAS 
were due to not receiving the vaccine in the proper time window.

Table 41: Disposition of participants, efficacy populations, treatment as randomized
In the mFAS-PD2, the mean age (standard deviation [SD]) of participants in the mFAS-PD2 was 36.1 
(12.8) years. The mean age was similar across both treatment groups. Most participants (94.2%) were 
aged between 18 and 59 years and a total of 662 (5.8%) participants were aged ≥60 years. Using a 
different age cut-off, the majority of participants (97.3%) were aged between 18 and 64 years and a 
total of 311 (2.7%) participants were aged ≥65 years. 
Participants’ predominant race was Black or African American (44.4%), followed by Asian (41.9%), 
American Indian or Alaska Native (4.8%), and White (0.6%). Most of participants (84.6% of 11416 
participants from mFAS-PD2) were non-naïve at the first or second injection.

medical condition group - randomized participants 
•  Outcomes and estimation 
In the FAS, there were 322 participants (106 in the Vaccine Group and 216 in the Placebo Group) who 
reported a total of 324 OVID-19-like illness (CLI) episodes (2 participants experienced 2 CLIs) 
confirmed by the adjudication committee to meet the primary endpoint definition of symptomatic 
COVID-19.  
In this population, 18 participants (10 in the Vaccine Group and 8 in the Placebo Group) met the case 
definition of severe COVID-19. 
Assessment report  
EMA/893684/2022  
Page 109/185 
 
 
 
 
In the primary efficacy population (i.e., mFAS-PD2), there were 121 participants (32 in the Vaccine 
Group and 89 in the Placebo Group) who reported 121 CLI episodes confirmed by the adjudication 
committee to meet the primary endpoint definition of symptomatic COVID-19 at the time of the data 
extraction. The distribution of these cases by country were as follows 49 cases in Mexico, 35 in India, 
16 in Nepal, 10 in Colombia 10 in Kenya, 1 in Ghana. There were no adjudicated cases in Uganda. In 
this population, 5 participants (3 in the Vaccine Group and 2 in the Placebo Group) met the case 
definition of severe COVID-19. 
Primary Efficacy 
Prevention of Symptomatic COVID-19 Occurring ≥14 Days After VAC2, regardless of prior SARS-CoV-2 
infection 
Primary efficacy was evaluated in the mFAS-PD2 as occurrences of symptomatic COVID-19 in each 
treatment group (see Section 3.2.5 for the definition of symptomatic COVID-19). As shown in below, 
the vaccine efficacy (VE) against symptomatic COVID-19 case occurrence was 64.7% (95% CI: 46.6; 
77.2) meeting the primary efficacy objective (i.e., to obtain a point estimate of VE > 50%, as 
calculated by the incidence rate ratio [IRR], with the lower bound of the 95% CI > 30%). 
Table 43: Vaccine efficacy (1-IRR) against symptomatic COVID-19 - mFAS-PD2 
Additional sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint were conducted to evaluate VE. 
Generally, VE point estimates by sensitivity analysis were consistent with the primary endpoint. It also 
includes the sensitivity analysis with participants from Ukraine sites with a VE of 64.0% (95% CI: 
45.9; 76.6) in the mFAS-PD2. 
Sensitivity Analysis 1: 
The VE based on the relative risk (RR) of symptomatic COVID-19 case occurrence was 64.2% (95% 
CI: 45.8; 76.9).

Survival Analysis 
In addition, survival analyses based on Stratified Cox proportional hazard model were used to estimate 
the VE against symptomatic COVID-19 case occurrence, as a supportive analysis. The model includes 
separate hazard functions for age group, sex, and high-risk medical condition group.  
Based on the Stratified Cox proportional hazard model, the VE for symptomatic COVID-19 was 64.3% 
(95% CI: 46.5; 76.2) for the mFAS-PD2 and 62.7% (95% CI: 44.0; 75.2) for the PPAS. Kaplan-Meier 
curves were also generated with 95% CI. As shown below, the curves diverge 14 days after the second 
dose with a higher cumulative incidence in the Placebo group than the Vaccine group.

Key Secondary Efficacy 
Prevention of SARS-CoV-2 Infection Occurring ≥14 Days After VAC2 in Naïve Participants 
The VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection (1-RR) occurring ≥14 days after the second injection in naïve 
participants is presented below. The number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection includes serologically-
confirmed cases in addition to virologically-confirmed cases. The VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection was 
9.6% (95% CI: -16.4; 29.9) not meeting the key secondary efficacy objective (i.e., the lower bound of 
95% CI was < 0%).

Similar results to the ones observed for the mFAS-PD2 Naïve-D01+D22 set were observed in the PPAS 
Naïve-D01+D22 set with a VE of 8.7% (95% CI: -17.9; 29.4) against infection. 
Prevention of Severe COVID-19 Occurring ≥14 Days After VAC2, regardless of prior SARS-CoV-2 
infection 
The VE against severe COVID-19 (1-IRR) occurring ≥14 days after the second injection in all 
participants regardless of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection has been presented. All cases of severe COVID-
19 were symptomatic COVID-19 cases (i.e., virologically-confirmed) meeting severity criteria as 
determined by the adjudication committee. Hypothesis testing for this key secondary objective was 
conditional to the success of the primary objective and the collection of 22 severe cases. Yet, only 5 
cases of severe COVID-19 cases were collected, and hypothesis testing was not performed.  The very 
limited cases count (3 cases in the Vaccine Group and 2 cases in the Placebo Group) precludes any 
definite conclusion about efficacy against severe COVID-19. Same results were reported in the 
sensitivity analysis performed with the inclusion of participants from Ukraine. Based on the Stratified 
Cox proportional hazard model, the VE against severe COVID-19 was similar for the mFAS-PD2 and for 
the PPAS.

Descriptive Efficacy – Multiple Disease Endpoints and by Variants in Various Populations 
Efficacy for Multiple Disease Endpoints 
Overall, there was no death associated with COVID-19 and a limited number of severe COVID-19 and 
hospitalized symptomatic COVID-19 in both the Vaccine Group and the Placebo Group. Also, there 
were few cases of symptomatic COVID-19 with severity of moderate or worse. With a limited case 
count (no case in the Vaccine Group and a maximum of 2 cases in the Placebo Group), the point of 
estimate for VE against hospitalized symptomatic COVID-19 was 100%. 
Assessment report  
EMA/893684/2022

Sensitivity analyses with the inclusion of participants from Ukrainian sites were performed. Overall, 
results with and without participants from Ukraine sites were similar. 
Efficacy in the Overall Population (regardless of prior infection status) 
At PD1 (mFAS-PD1), the VE against symptomatic COVID-19 was 60.3% (95% CI: 47.1; 70.5) in all 
participants with 68 cases in the Vaccine Group and 169 in the Placebo Group. Kaplan-Meier curves 
were also generated with 95% CI. The curves diverge 14 days after the first dose with a higher 
cumulative incidence in the Placebo group than the Vaccine group. 
Figure 9: Kaplan-Meier curve for symptomatic COVID-19 - mFAS-PD1 
For VE against symptomatic COVID-19 at PD2, refer to primary efficacy section. The VE (1-IRR) PD2 
against CDC-defined COVID-19 was 65.4% (95% CI: 47.4; 77.8) in all participants with 31 cases in 
the Vaccine Group and 88 in the Placebo Group. 
With a limited case count for symptomatic COVID-19 with severity of moderate or worse (i.e., 5 cases 
in the Vaccine Group and 7 cases in the Placebo Group), the VE (1-IRR) PD2 was 29.9% (95% CI: -
156.5; 82.5). For VE against severe COVID-19 at PD2, refer to key secondary efficacy objective. 
Efficacy in Non-Naïve Participants 
The VE was not assessed for SARS-CoV-2 infection and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection since 
those endpoints are only assessed in naïve participants. 
The VE (1-IRR) PD1 against symptomatic COVID-19 in Non-Naïve participants was 75.9% (95% CI: 
62.7; 84.9) with 26 cases in the Vaccine Group and 106 in the Placebo Group. At PD2, the VE was 
75.1% (95% CI: 56.3; 86.6) with 16 cases in the Vaccine Group and 63 in the Placebo Group. Kaplan-
Meier curves were also generated with 95% CI. The curves diverge 14 days after the second dose with 
a higher cumulative incidence in the Placebo group than the Vaccine group.

For the CDC-defined COVID-19, the VE (1-IRR) PD1 in Non-Naïve participants was 76.8% (95% CI: 
63.9; 85.6) with 25 cases in the Vaccine Group and 106 in the Placebo Group. At PD2, the VE was 
76.2% (95% CI: 57.7; 87.4) with 15 cases in the Vaccine Group and 62 in the Placebo Group. 
There were only 2 cases of severe COVID-19 at PD1 and 1 case at PD2 in the Placebo Group. With a 
limited case count for symptomatic COVID-19 with severity of moderate or worse, the VE (1-IRR) PD1 
was 60.6% (95% CI: -140.4; 96.3) with 2 cases in the Vaccine Group and 5 in the Placebo Group. At 
PD2, the VE (1-IRR) was 67.3% (95% CI: -307.7; 99.4) with 1 case in the Vaccine Group and 3 in the 
Placebo Group. 
Figure 10: Kaplan-Meier curve for symptomatic COVID-19 - mFAS-PD2 Non-Naïve-D01/D22 
Efficacy in Naïve Participants (mFAS-PD2 naïve D01 + D22) 
The VE (1-IRR) PD1 against symptomatic COVID-19 in Naïve participants was 38.2% (95% CI: 0.5; 
62.2) with 30 cases in the Vaccine Group and 48 in the Placebo Group. At PD2, the VE was 30.9% 
(95% CI: -39.3; 66.7) with 15 cases in the Vaccine Group and 22 in the Placebo Group. 
For the CDC-defined COVID-19, the VE (1-IRR) PD1 in Naïve participants was 38.8% (95% CI: 2.3; 
62.2) with 31 cases in the Vaccine Group and 50 in the Placebo Group. At PD2, the VE was 31.2% 
(95% CI: -38.8; 66.8) with 15 cases in the Vaccine Group and 22 in the Placebo Group. 
The limited case count for severe COVID-19 and symptomatic COVID-19 with severity of moderate or 
worse, i.e., low and similar number of cases in the Vaccine Group and the Placebo Group, precludes 
any definite conclusion. 
Both the VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection were determined in 
Naïve participants. The VE (1-RR) PD1 against SARS-CoV-2 infection was 5.9% (95% CI: -9.7; 19.4) 
with 326 cases in the Vaccine Group and 346 in the Placebo Group. For the VE PD 2 against SARS-CoV-
2 infection, refer to key secondary efficacy. The VE (1 RR) against asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection 
Assessment report

was ≤1.2% (PD1 and PD2) with 275 cases in the Vaccine Group and 266 in the Placebo Group at PD1; 
and with 100 cases in the Vaccine Group and 107 cases in the Placebo Group at PD2. 
Efficacy by Variants 
Viral genomic sequencing was performed on CLI respiratory samples from the cases to identify the 
causal SARS-CoV-2 variant.  
In the FAS, out of the 322 participants (106 in the Vaccine Group and 216 in the Placebo Group) who 
reported a total of 324 CLI episodes (2 participants experienced 2 CLIs) confirmed by the adjudication 
committee, viral genomic sequencing on the CLI samples showed that 19 (5.9%) participants were 
infected with Delta and 146 (45.3%) with Omicron. Among them, 6 participants experienced 1 case 
each with both Delta and Omicron variants sequenced. The variant for the remaining CLI samples was 
unknown (128 [39.8%] samples for which sequencing results were not available at the time of the 
database extraction) or produced no valid result (37 [11.5%] samples that were tested but sequencing 
failed to produce a valid sequence). Viral genomic sequencing of the severe cases showed that 8 
(2.5%) participants were infected with Omicron, 1 (0.3%) participant was infected with Delta, no valid 
result was produced for 1 (0.3%) participant, and the variant was unknown for 8 (2.5%) participants. 
In the primary efficacy population (i.e., mFAS-PD2), among the 121 adjudicated cases in the primary 
efficacy population (mFAS-PD2; 32 in Vaccine Group and 89 in the Placebo Group), viral genomic 
sequencing identified the strain which caused the infection in 68 cases, 63 corresponded to the 
Omicron variant, 4 to Delta, and 1 to Omicron and Delta. Sequencing for other adjudicated cases did 
not produce a valid result in 13 cases. The 40 remaining cases were classified as unknown variants as 
the results were not available at the time of the database extraction. Further investigations were 
conducted which showed that for these 40 remaining cases (unknown), 7 were diagnosed exclusively 
based on an external local test, therefore, samples were not available for sequencing; 1 sample was 
not tested; 12 did not meet the minimal viral load threshold required to be tested for sequencing (2.8 
log copies/mL); and 19 were tested for sequencing but failed quality controls, therefore, no sequencing 
results were available. Additionally, one case that was diagnosed exclusively by local test was 
mistakenly included in the unknown variant category. 
Efficacy against Symptomatic COVID-19 by Variants 
Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant 
The Omicron variant was the variant responsible for the highest number of symptomatic infections. 
Only BA.1 and BA.2 subvariants were circulating at the time of the study and were detected by 
sequencing. None of the current circulating BA.4 and BA.5 sub-variants were identified. 
Among cases for whom sequencing results were available, the VE (1-IRR) PD1 in participants 
regardless of prior infectious status was 64.8% (95% CI: 45.9; 77.6) with 30 cases in the Vaccine 
Group and 84 in the Placebo Group and the VE PD2 was 72.5% (95% CI: 49.5; 86.0) with 14 cases in 
the Vaccine Group and 50 cases in the Placebo Group. 
In Non-Naïve participants, the VE (1-IRR) PD1 was 88.3% (95% CI: 70.4; 96.4) with 5 cases in the 
Vaccine Group and 42 in the Placebo Group and 93.9% (95% CI: 75.9; 99.3) at PD2 (2 cases in the 
Vaccine Group and 32 in the Placebo Group).  
In Naïve participants, the VE (1-IRR) PD1 was 49.1% (95% CI: 5.9; 73.4) with 17 cases in the Vaccine 
Group and 33 in the Placebo Group and 20.4% (95% CI: -88.7; 67.3) PD2 (11 cases in the Vaccine 
Group and 14 in the Placebo Group). 
However, the number of cases with no valid results or unknown variants (i.e., samples for which 
results of sequencing testing was not available in the database at the time of the extraction) was 
Assessment report  
EMA/893684/2022  
Page 116/185 
 
 
 
approximately 44%. Therefore, additional sensitivity analyses were performed to account for cases 
without confirmed sequencing results. This sensitivity analysis assumed that cases with no sequencing 
results were caused by the Omicron variant considering that this variant was responsible for the 
majority of the symptomatic infections and that the temporal distribution of the cases with unknown 
variant and those with no valid results matched the distribution of cases due to Omicron variant. As 
most of participants were non-naïve, similar distribution of unknown and non-valid results cases was 
observed. 
Results of this sensitivity analysis for the mFAS-PD2 (all participants) showed that the VE (1-IRR) PD2 
was 63.1% (95% CI: 43.9; 76.2) with 32 cases in the Vaccine Group and 85 in the Placebo Group. 
In Non-Naïve participants, the efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 at PD2 due to Omicron variant 
was 73.8% (95% CI: 53.9; 85.9). This was lower than that observed only accounting for those cases 
with confirmed sequencing available. 
In Naïve participants, the VE (1-IRR) PD2 following sensitivity analysis was 27.6% (95% CI: - 47.3; 
65.3) with 15 in the Vaccine Group and 21 in the Placebo Group. 
Delta (B.1.617.2) variant 
For the Delta variant, the number of cases was limited.  
In all participants regardless of prior infectious status, the VE (1-IRR) PD1 was 43.6% (95% CI:  
121.8; 87.9) with 4 cases in the Vaccine Group and 7 in the Placebo Group and the VE PD2 was 100% 
(no case in the Vaccine Group and 5 in the Placebo Group). 
In Non-Naïve participants, the VE (1-IRR) PD1 was 80.3% (95% CI: -75.9; 99.6) with 1 case in the 
Vaccine Group and 5 in the Placebo Group and 100% (95% CI: -48.8; 100.0) at PD2 (no case in the 
Vaccine Group and 4 in the Placebo Group). 
In Naïve participants, at PD1, there were 2 cases in the Vaccine Group and 1 case in the Placebo 
Group; at PD2, there was only one case in the Placebo Group. 
Unknown variants and sequencing not producing valid results 
For cases with unknown variant results, the VE (1-IRR) PD 2 was 34.6% (95% CI: -28.3; 67.5) in all 
participants regardless of prior infectious status, with 16 cases in the Vaccine Group and 24 in the 
Placebo Group. In Non-Naïve participants the VE (1-RR) PD2 was 41.1% (95% CI: -26.6; 73.7) with 
12 cases in the Vaccine Group and 20 in the Placebo Group. In Naïve participants, at PD2 the number 
of unknown variant results was the same in the Vaccine Group and the Placebo Group with 4 cases in 
each group. 
For the sequencing that did not produce valid results because testing failed to produce a valid 
sequence, the VE (1-IRR) PD2 was 82.2% (95% CI: 18.3; 98.1) in all participants (2 cases in the 
Vaccine Group and 11 in the Placebo Group) and 75.4% (95% CI: -23.0; 97.5) in Non-Naïve 
participants (2 cases in the Vaccine Group and 8 in the Placebo Group). In Naïve participants, at PD2, 
there were no cases of variants that did not produce valid results in the Vaccine Group and 3 in the 
Placebo Group. 
Efficacy against Severe COVID-19 by Variants 
The overall number of severe disease cases was very limited which either precluded to estimate the VE 
by variant or lead to a point of estimate of 100% for the VE with only 1 case in the Placebo Group and 
no case in the Vaccine Group.

Descriptive Efficacy – Subgroup Analyses 
This section presents results for exploratory efficacy with the analysis of the prevention of symptomatic 
COVID-19 by subgroups. 
The CDC-defined COVID-19 subgroups analysis was similar to that of symptomatic COVID-19. For 
other endpoints (hospitalized symptomatic COVID-19, death associated with symptomatic COVID 19, 
severe COVID-19, and symptomatic COVID-19 with severity of moderate or worse), given the small 
number of or lack of cases in some of these subgroups, the comparison across subgroups is limited. 
Efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 in All Participants regardless of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection by 
subgroups 
Vaccine efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 by age groups in all participants regardless of prior 
SARS-CoV-2 infection is presented in Table 5.10. With fewer cases and a wider 95% CI, the youngest 
age group 18 to 25 years presented a lower VE than the 18-59 years age group (VE [1- IRR] PD2 of 
67.3% [95% CI: 49.7; 79.3]) that accounted for most of participants. The older age groups presented 
a limited number of participants at risk and cases, which precluded a definitive conclusion. 
Table 48: Vaccine efficacy (1-IRR) against symptomatic COVID-19 by age group - mFAS-PD2 (All 
participants regardless of baseline SARS-CoV-2 status) 
A summary of VE against symptomatic COVID-19 after the 2nd dose (mFAS-PD2) by sex, country, 
race/ethnicity, and high-risk medical condition in all participants regardless of baseline SARS-CoV-2 
status was provided: 
•  The VE in males was higher when compared to females (70.0% [95% CI: 43.0; 85.2] versus 
59.7% [95% CI: 30.0; 77.7]).  
•  There was no case of symptomatic COVID-19 in Uganda and one case in the Placebo Group in 
Ghana. In other countries, the VE was 44.0% (95% CI: -3.3; 70.5) in Mexico, 61.1% (95% CI: 
-70.4; 93.5) in Colombia, 57.7% (95% CI: -85.4; 92.9) in Kenya, 79.6% (95% CI: 50.0; 93.1) 
in India, and 85.7% (95% CI: 37.8; 98.4) in Nepal.  
Assessment report  
EMA/893684/2022  
Page 118/185 
 
 
 
 
•  The VE was 81.1% (95% CI: 59.3; 92.3) in Asian participants and 63.4% (95% CI: -52.6; 
93.7) in Black or African American participants. In White participants, there was no case of 
symptomatic COVID-19, but these participants accounted for only 0.6% of the overall mFAS-
PD 2 analysis set.  
• 
In participants aged 18 to 59 years and with risk factors for severe COVID-19, the VE was 
66.2% (95% CI: 28.2; 85.3) and comparable to that observed in participants without risk 
factors for severe COVID-19 in that age group (i.e., VE: 68.0% [95% CI: 45.5; 82.0]). In 
participants aged ≥65 years with risk factors for COVID-19, the VE was not calculated as there 
was only one case in the Vaccine group and no case in the Placebo Group. 
Efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 in Non-Naïve participants by subgroups 
The VE (1-IRR) of 18-59 years age group that accounted for most of participants was 74.1% (95% CI: 
54.6; 86.1) and was similar to the point estimate of VE in the youngest age group (18 to 25 years). 
The older age groups presented a limited number of participants at risk and cases, which precluded a 
definitive conclusion. 
A summary of VE against symptomatic COVID-19 after the 2nd dose (mFAS-PD2 Non-Naïve- D01/D22) 
by sex, country, race/ethnicity, and high-risk medical condition in Non-Naïve participants was 
presented: 
•  The VE in males and females was comparable.  
•  There was no case of symptomatic COVID-19 in Uganda and one case in the Placebo Group in 
Ghana. In other countries, the VE was 66.6% (95% CI:11.2; 89.2) in Mexico, 82.5% (95% CI: 
-56.7; 99.6) in Colombia, 83.1% (95% CI: -38.9; 99.6) in Kenya, 79.7% (95% CI: 50.2; 93.1) 
in India, and 60.4% (95% CI: -141.7; 96.2) in Nepal.  
•  The VE was 76.1% (95% CI: 47.3; 90.5) in Asian participants and 85.8% (95% CI: -10.5; 
99.7) in Black or African American participants. In White participants, there was no case of 
symptomatic COVID-19, but these participants accounted for only a small proportion of the 
overall study population. 
• 
In participants aged 18 to 59 years and with risk factors for severe COVID-19, the VE was 
71.9% (95% CI: 20.5; 91.9) and comparable to that observed in participants without risk 
factors for severe COVID-19 in that age group (i.e., VE: 75.1% [95% CI: 50.9; 88.4]). In 
participants aged ≥65 years with risk factors for severe COVID-19, the VE was not calculated 
as there was no case versus only one case in the Placebo Group for those without risk factors 
for severe COVID-19. 
Efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 in Naïve Participants by subgroups 
The VE (1-IRR) of 18-59 years age group that accounted for most of participants was 41.9% (95% CI: 
-20.5; 73.1). With fewer cases in the 18-25 year age group, estimates of VE were imprecise. The older 
age groups presented a limited number of participants at risk and cases, which precluded a definitive 
conclusion. 
A summary of VE against symptomatic COVID-19 by sex, race/ethnicity, and high-risk medical 
condition in naïve participants at the second injection was presented: 
•  The VE in males was higher when compared to females (42.0% [95% CI: -92.7; 84.7] versus 
25.1% [95% CI: -84.9; 70.6]). 
•  Overall, when looking at country level, there were few cases of symptomatic COVID-19 in 
Naïve participants. There was no case in Uganda, Ghana or India. In Mexico and Colombia, the 
Assessment report

number of cases was the same in the Vaccine Group and the Placebo Group, i.e., 11 cases per 
group and 2 cases per group, respectively. In Kenya, there were 2 cases in the Vaccine Group 
and 1 case in the Placebo Group. In Nepal, the VE was 100.0% (95% CI: 39.9; 100.0) with no 
case in the Vaccine Group and 8 in the Placebo Group. 
• 
In Asian participants, the VE was 100.0% [95% CI: 37.4; 100.0]) with all 8 cases in the 
Placebo Group. In Black or African American participants, the case count was very limited and 
similar in both the Vaccine Group and the Placebo Group. In White participants, there was no 
case of symptomatic COVID-19, but these participants accounted for only 0.9% of the overall 
mFAS-PD2 Naïve-D01+D22 analysis set. 
• 
In participants aged 18 to 59 years and with risk factors for severe COVID-19, the VE was 
41.6% (95% CI: -102.4; 85.0) and comparable to that observed in participants without risk 
factors for severe COVID-19 in that age group (i.e., VE: 41.4% [95% CI: -49.6; 78.7]). In 
participants aged ≥ 65 years with risk factors for severe COVID-19, the VE was not calculated 
as there was only one case in the Vaccine group.

The neutralising Ab GMTR against Omicron BA.1 variant strain of VidPrevtyn Beta 
relative to Comirnaty was 2.53 (95% CI: 1.80; 3.57) which meets the superiority 
criterion of lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI of GMTR > 1.2. 
Analysis 
description 
Secondary analysis and exploratory analysis  
The difference of neutralising seroresponse rate against Omicron BA.1 variant strain 
between VidPrevtyn Beta and Comirnaty was 3.8 (95% CI: -3.9; 12.8) which meets 
the non-inferiority criterion of lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI of the difference > -
10%. 
The neutralising Ab GMTR against D614G strain of VidPrevtyn Beta relative to 
Comirnaty was 1.43 (95% CI: 1.06; 1.94) which does not meet the superiority 
criterion of lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI of GMTR > 1.2. 
The difference of neutralising seroresponse rate against D614G strain between 
VidPrevtyn Beta and Comirnaty was 3.0 (95% CI: -6.9; 12.8) which meets the non-
inferiority criterion of lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI of the difference > -10%. 
VidPrevtyn Beta booster vaccine induced 2.5-fold higher neutralising antibody titres 
against Omicron BA.4/5 than those induced by Comirnaty booster in the fully validated 
Monogram PsVN assay. 
Furthermore, the neutralising seroresponse rates observed with the VidPrevtyn Beta at 
D28 was higher than those observed with Comirnaty, irrespective of the variant tested. 
For Omicron BA.4/BA.5, 98% (95% CI: 89.1; 99.9) of participants who received the 
VidPrevtyn Beta booster vaccine showed at least a 4-fold rise in neutralising antibody 
titres from D0 to D28 versus 85.5% (95% CI: 73.3; 93.5) of participants with the 
Comirnaty booster vaccine.  
The difference of seroresponse rate between VidPrevtyn Beta and Comirnaty booster 
vaccine was 12.5 (95% CI: 1.4; 24.2).

Analysis 
description 
Secondary descriptive analysis 
Overall, a meaningful boosting effect of either a single dose of MV CoV2 preS dTM-
AS03 (B.1.351) booster vaccine against D614G and B.1.351 variant strains is 
observed irrespective of the priming vaccine/platform and the age group.  
At D15, neutralising Ab GMTs against D614G strain after MV CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 
(B.1.351) booster vaccines in all participants (≥ 18 years of age) increased by about 
14-fold in mRNA primed group and more than 28-fold in adenovirus-vectored 
primed group. Against B.1.351 strain and at D15, neutralising Ab GMTs increased by 
39-fold in mRNA primed group and more than 72-fold in adenovirus-vectored 
primed group after MV CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) booster vaccine.  
The neutralising Ab seroresponse rate (participants with ≥ 4-fold rise in neutralising 
Ab titres) against both strains tested was high across all priming platform groups 
(> 76% of participants). 
2.5.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
VAT00013 
VAT000013, a randomized, single-blind, multicentre, investigator-sponsored French Phase III study, is 
currently ongoing. The study features an intuitive, clear-cut design: Participants 18 years of age and 
older who have been previously vaccinated with Pfizer/BioNTech’s primary vaccine series were 
randomly assigned to one of three treatment arms corresponding to each booster group (i.e. mRNA 
booster, VidPrevtyn Beta (B.1.35.1 strain) or VidPrevtyn (D614 strain)). VAT00013 was not designed 
as a pivotal study. For a pivotal trial, planned sample size was small, with only 300 participants in 
total. In accordance with the intended target population, half should include older people ≥65 years. 
Due to limited recruitment in this population, the enrolment cap in the ≥65 years group was removed 
during study conduct. In terms of the intended therapeutic indication, this limits the validity of the 
study results for this patient group. Individuals with immunodeficiencies or autoimmune diseases were 
excluded, which also limits the validity of the study results for this patient group. 
The sample size calculation is acceptable and could be reproduced. The study assumptions, however, 
were not satisfied in the study, resulting in lower proportions, a lower sample size per group 
(approximately 80 subjects), and wider confidence intervals (approximately 10%). However, this is not 
considered to have a major impact on the trial conclusions. 
Post-hoc analyses were determined retrospectively to allow comparison of the superiority of an

approved mRNA vaccine against Omicron BA.1 for the scope of this application, showing an 
improvement in neutralising antibody responses to clinically relevant circulating variants of concern 
(VoC) and a non-inferior seroresponse rate in comparison to the approved Comirnaty vaccine. As the 
Omicron variant was the prevalent circulating VoC, the primary objective was denoted on comparisons 
of neutralising antibody responses against Omicron BA.1. Exploratory objectives also include analyses 
for BA.4/BA.5, Beta and Delta, which is acknowledged. The original protocol-defined primary analysis 
compares the proportion of participants with at least 10-fold increase in neutralising antibodies 
between baseline and D15 among the 3 study arms. For post-hoc-analyses, the latest available 
timepoint for antibody responses used were the D28 post-booster samples, also providing information 
on the durability of antibody responses.  
In addition, a conditional secondary objective assesses neutralising antibodies against D614G strain to 
demonstrate non-inferiority against the parental monovalent D614 vaccine.  
The chosen objectives and endpoints are of relevance to conclude on the benefit/risk and to inform 
vaccination recommendations.  
The most important limitation of this study was that the primary analysis of neutralising antibodies was 
performed with a Microneutralisation Assay (MNA) that was not validated. This critical issue was 
resolved by performing a re-analysis of the samples using a validated Monogram PsVN. It is noted that 
not all samples could be re-analysed in the validated Monogram PsVN assays as participants needed to 
be re-consented to this analysis. Eventually, 86% and 89% of the analysis sets of VidPrevtyn Beta and 
Comirnaty, respectively, were re-analysed, translating into 54 samples in VidPrevtyn Beta group and 
60 samples in the Comirnaty group.  
The applicant provided a comparison of the demographics in these analyses stratified to gender, age 
category and age (mean; min; max). Overall the demographics are comparable between these 
analyses. A stress test was also performed in order to exclude a bias from non-tested samples. The 
data was provided and considered acceptable.  
There was a discussion on the comparably low number of participants in this study VAT00013, in 
particular in the elderly population. This age group is furthered studied in 2 ongoing studies. One of 
these studies is an ancillary study to VAT00013. Additional results in particular in the elderly 
population would become available by Q1 2023 (REC).  
There were no data on immunocompromised individuals in study VAT00013. As 
immunogenicity/efficacy data in the immunocompromised individuals might be different from those 
observed in the overall population, the Applicant should provide immunogenicity and safety data on 
this population from the two planned independent studies (VAT00027 and VAT00028) as soon as 
results are available (REC).   
VAT00002 - Supplemental Phase III Cohort 2 
As part of an amendment to the original VAT00002 study, Supplemental Phase III Cohorts have been 
incorporated into the study. All parts of study VAT00002 are ongoing. The key Booster Cohort 2 results 
presented include data for the primary safety objectives collected up to the data extraction date (13 
May 2022), and the primary and some secondary immunogenicity objectives collected up to D15 (14 
days post booster-injection). Also presented are the Comparator Group results for the primary and 
secondary immunogenicity objectives collected up to D36 (i.e. 14 days post-dose 2 of the primary 
schedule of D614 strain). It is highlighted that VidPrevtyn (D614 strain) for primary series is not 
approved. 
Supplemental Phase III cohorts of study VAT00002 have a parallel, randomized, modified double-blind 
design for Booster Cohort 2.Two booster vaccine options were evaluated in the Booster Cohort 2:

VidPrevtyn Beta, and a bivalent version of VidPrevtyn Beta with the same amount of total antigen but 
in addition to the beta strain it also contains the original strain. 
The study design is per se adequate to assess the nAB immune response of a booster dose of 
VidPrevtyn Beta after priming with 2 different COVID-19 vaccine platforms, i.e. after priming with 
either 2 mRNA or 2 Ad-vector COVID-19 vaccines. Moreover, a homologous protein booster was also 
assessed. The limitation of the study design is, that the nAB immune response after a booster dose of 
VidPrevtyn Beta is only assessed in comparison to SARS-CoV-2 seronegative individuals in a 
comparator group that has received 2 doses of 10µg of the VidPrevtyn (D614 strain) which is not 
approved for primary schedule. The co-primary objectives in VAT00002 were to demonstrate non-
inferiority of the immune response against strain B.1.351 on day 15 post booster dose, to the immune 
response against the D614G strain induced by a 2-dose 10 μg primary series of VidPrevtyn (D614 
strain) vaccine on day 36, and superiority to the immune response against B.1.351 observed 
immediately before booster. A comparator arm to compare the immune response induced by 
VidPrevtyn Beta as a booster dose with that induced by a booster dose of an approved COVID-19 
vaccine was not implemented in VAT00002.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
VAT00013 
Study VAT00013 met the primary objective. The Applicant performed key analyses from the study 
report including immunogenicity at D15 and D28 with the revised Per protocol population tested with 
MNA, with the exclusion of 6 screening failures, which initially were include. The neutralising Ab 
geometric mean titre ratio (GMTR) against Omicron BA.1 variant strain of VidPrevtyn Beta vaccine 
relative to Comirnaty, using the validated Monogram PsVN was 2.53 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 
1.80; 3.57) which meets the superiority criterion.  
Non-inferiority of the sero-response rate (D28/D0) against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1 could be 
demonstrated with SRR difference of 3.8 (95% CI -3.9; 12.8). Therefore, the conditional secondary 
objective 2 has been met. 
Superiority of the GMT ratio against SARS-CoV-2 D614G could not be demonstrated with GMTR 1.43 
(95% CI 1.06; 1.94) as the lower bound of the CI was not >1.2 . Therefore, the conditional co-
secondary objective 3 was not met. Though not pre-specified, non-inferiority of the GMT ratio against 
SARS-CoV-2 D614G would be given. 
Non-inferiority of the sero-response rate against SARS-CoV-2 D614G could be demonstrated with SRR 
difference of 3.0 (95% CI -6.9; 12.8). 
GMTs against BA.4-5 with a validated Monogram PsVN assay were also provided. Booster vaccinations 
with Vidprevtyn Beta and Comirnaty resulted in GMTs of 925 and 370, respectively. This translates to a 
GMTR of 2.5 (95% CI 1.7; 3.67) which would meet the superiority criterion (lower bound of 95% CI 
>1.2) once it would have been pre-specified. Therefore, a substantially better increase of nAB titres 
against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.4-5 after booster vaccination with Vidprevtyn Beta as compared to 
Comirnaty can be noted. 
Only 6 participants older than 65 years of age were recruited. As such, it is questionable whether the 
results can be extrapolated to the elderly population with regard to the intended indication. VAT00002 
study included more participants from this age group, moreover the applicant initiated 2 studies in the 
elderly to assess safety and immunogenicity of VidPrevtyn Beta.  
VAT00002 - Supplemental Phase III Cohort 2 
The two co-primary immunogenicity objectives were met. VidPrevtyn Beta used as a booster

demonstrated in adults (18-55 years of age) previously vaccinated with Comirnaty that induces an 
immune response against B.1.351 strain at D15 that is non-inferior to the immune response against 
D614G strain induced by a 2-dose 10 μg primary series of VidPrevtyn (D614) vaccine in naïve 
individuals at day 36 and superior to that observed immediately before booster. 
The descriptive analysis of GMTs and GMTRs indicates a notable increase of nABs after a booster dose 
of the VidPrevtyn Beta against both the D614 and the B.1.351 strains irrespective of priming 
vaccine/priming platform in both age cohorts. The proportion of elderly is limited to 140 subjects 
(10.5%). The increase is higher for GMTs against D614G than that against B.1.351. In contrast GMTRs 
were higher against the B.1.351 strain. It is of importance, that baseline GMTs against the B.1.351 
strain were lower compared to baseline antibody titres against the D614 strain. Different baseline titres 
against different strains in the different intervention groups are most likely due to a different extent by 
priming vaccination and in addition to natural infection before booster (i.e. between D1 and booster). 
The intervention group participants reflect the “real-world” primed population with baseline immunity 
induced by either vaccination or natural infection. The numbers and proportions of participants with 
unrecognized prior SARS-CoV-2 infection in the intervention cohorts (booster cohorts) is currently not 
known. This is a weakness of the study conduct. Unrecognised SARS-CoV-2 infections previous to 
booster could alter the immune response to the booster vaccination. An analysis stratified by previous 
SARS-CoV-2 infection status prior to booster vaccination is considered of importance to estimate the 
boosting effect of the vaccine alone. The Applicant has retrospectively evaluated the baseline samples 
of booster arms for the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein. The testing has been 
performed but the analysis of responses stratified by baseline anti-nucleoprotein serostatus is ongoing 
at the time of this submission and will be provided as soon as it is available (REC). 
All 3 booster vaccines, i.e. VidPrevtyn Beta (B.1.351), Bivalent VidPrevtyn Original/Beta 
(D614+B.1.531) and VidPrevtyn (D614) induced notable increases in neutralising titres to all Omicron 
subvariants in younger and older adults primed with Comirnaty on D15, when compared to pre-boost 
level. GMTs tended to be lower in the older age cohort. A direct and systematically comparison of the 
immune response against each Omicron subvariant (BA.1; BA.2; BA.4) for the 3 formulations was not 
performed. Comparison of the three formulations in light of the data presented is impeded by the fact 
that the assessment of immunogenicity was performed in different laboratories. Moreover, the subset 
of participants for the evaluation is small, and the baseline Ab levels are different against the different 
substrains and different in each booster vaccine group. The difference in baseline antibody titres is 
likely due to some individuals being infected prior to booster administration. No immunogenicity data 
assessing the nAB immune response against Omicron subvariants are available for priming vaccines 
different from Comirnaty. 
The descriptive immunogenicity data, i.e., GMTRs on day 15 and GMTRs D15/D0 indicate a robust 
booster immune response in the older population, though in a limited sample size with regard to 
subjects 65 years of age and older. 
This study is however supportive as the Comparator used was not an approved COVID-19 vaccine. 
The monovalent and bivalent vaccine formulations were not directly compared. The immunogenicity 
profile that derives from the neutralising antibody response however appears to be broadly 
comparable.  
VAT0008 Stage 2 
This study was a randomized, modified double-blind, placebo-controlled design, conducted in adults 18 
years of age and older to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of a primary series of 2 
injections of 10 μg antigen dose (5 μg antigen per strain) of the bivalent VidPrevtyn Original/Beta 
(D614 and B.1.351. strains) administered 21 days apart by intramuscular (IM) route.

Initially it was planned that participants who were SARS-CoV-2 non-naïve as determined by a rapid 
serodiagnostic test at baseline were to be capped to a maximum of approximately 30% of the total 
study population (up to ~1633 participants/arm in Stage 2). The rapid serodiagnostic test turned out 
to be less sensitive than expected and in turn numerous SARS-CoV-2 pre-infections were determined 
at a subsequent testing. The applicant argues that due to a change in the global epidemiological data 
and the change in the primary endpoint to the overall population regardless of prior SARS-CoV-2 
infection, the cap of 30% of SARS-CoV-2 non-naïve was removed. Out of the 13,002 randomised 
participants, 12,924 (99.4%) were included in the Full Analysis Set (FAS). As a result of not detecting 
prior SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline and/or removing the enrolment cap for non-naïve participants 
only 1176 participants were naïve at D01, and only 683 participants (5.3%) were naïve at D01 and 
Day22 in the FAS. 
In mFAS-PD2 the participants predominant race was Black or African American (44.4%), followed by 
Asian (41.9%), American Indian or Alaska Native (4.8%), and White (0.6%). This does not reflect the 
racial demographics in the EU. Nevertheless, there are no known differences in vaccine efficacy in 
different ethnicities, the presented racial demographics do not prevent the use of these results. 
There were imbalances in the demographics for sex (1.4-fold more male than female) and age (mean 
age about 36 years; only 2.6% of participants ≥65 years). 
Depending on age strata, the median follow-up post-dose 2 was between 54 to 58 days. 
Study VAT0008 Stage 2 could not demonstrate efficacy in mFAS-PD2 Naïve D01+D22 as the lower 
bound of CI was negative for protection against infection (VE 9.6%, 95% CI -16.4; 29.9) and against 
symptomatic COVID-19 disease (VE 30.9%, 95% CI -39.9; 66.7%).  
Study VAT0008 Stage 2 demonstrated efficacy in the population of previously SARS-CoV-2 infected 
participants with 75.9% VE (95% CI 62.7; 84.9) in mFAS-PD1 Non-Naïve (first vaccination dose) and 
75.1% VE (95% CI 56.3; 86.6) in mFAS-PD2 Non-Naïve (second vaccination dose). The limited follow-
up time of 21 days in mFAS-PD1 Non-Naïve (first vaccination dose) needs to be considered. 
Notably, VE after the first vaccination dose and after the second vaccination dose is comparable but 
not increased. One could speculate that in such setting the vaccination shares similarity to a booster 
vaccination dose after prior infection, indicating that the increase in efficacy from mFAS-PD2 Naïve 
D01+D22 to mFAS-PD2 Non-Naïve needs to be attributed to prior SARS-CoV-2 infection rather than 
the capability of the bivalent CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (5 μg D614 + 5 μg B.1.351) vaccine to provide 
protection as a primary vaccination series. Comparison of neutralising antibody (nAB) GMTs after the 
first and the second vaccination doses could gain more insight addressing the question whether the 
second dose is substantially increasing nAB GMTs or not. 
Failure to demonstrate efficacy in mFAS-PD1 Non-Naïve against moderate or worse COVID-19 disease, 
or severe COVID-19 disease was impacted by the low number of events. 
Breakthrough infections were mostly due to infection with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant followed in 
frequency by SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant as expected from the prevalence of these variants at the time 
of study conduct. However, with introduction of the bivalent CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (5 μg D614 + 5 μg 
B.1.351) vaccine the applicant is providing results from a variant adapted vaccine meant to protect 
against emerging variants. 
Although there is no intended booster vaccination in study VAT0008 Stage 2, the analysis sets mFAS-
PD1 Non-Naïve and mFAS-PD2 Non-Naïve share a similarity to a booster vaccination as vaccinations 
are done in previously SARS-CoV-2 infected participants. Therefore, immunogenicity results from these 
analysis sets could be comparable to results from booster vaccinations. Given the short follow-up time 
of 21 days for mFAS-PD1 Non-Naïve for demonstrating VE, mFAS-PD2 Non-Naïve would be considered 
Assessment report  
EMA/893684/2022  
Page 130/185 
 
 
 
the appropriate analysis set for comparison of nAB GMTs. 
The protocol for VAT0008 Stage 2 lists additional secondary endpoints that have not been addressed in 
the brief CSR, including immunogenicity analyses. Comparing nAB GMTs from mFAS-PD2 Non-Naïve to 
those from VAT0013 or VAT0002 (Supplemental Phase III Cohort 2) could be a possibility to infer 
efficacy from VAT0008 Stage 2 to an expectation of effectiveness in VAT0013. For this purpose, nAB 
GMTs against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant BA.4/BA.5 after booster vaccination with CoV2 preS dTM-
AS03 (B.1.351) vaccine are deemed most relevant and should be compared to nAB GMTs against 
SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant BA.4/BA.5 from mFAS-PD2 Non-Naïve participants. 
No immunogenicity results for VAT0008 Stage 2 are available. The applicant is in the process of testing 
these samples and do not expect to have this data before the end of 2022 (REC). 
In conclusion, results from study VAT0008 Stage 2 cannot be compared to results from VAT0002 or 
VAT0013 and can therefore not be considered supportive to draw any conclusion on effectiveness of 
CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) vaccine as a booster vaccination up until relevant immunogenicity 
results from VAT008 Stage 2 become available. 
2.5.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In VAT00013 study, the immunogenicity of the VidPrevtyn Beta given as a single booster dose in 
Comirnaty primed participants was compared to VidPrevtyn (D614) non-approved booster vaccine and 
the Comirnaty (containing D614 strain) approved booster vaccine. Study VAT00013 met the primary 
objective and it is accepted to infer efficacy as a booster by an immunogenicity bridge. 
For VAT0002 the descriptive analysis of GMTs and GMTRs indicates a notable increase of nABs after a 
booster dose of the VidPrevtyn Beta against both the D614 and the B.1.351 strain irrespective of 
priming vaccine/priming platform (i.e. mRNA or adenoviral-vector vaccines).  
Study VAT0008 Stage 2 demonstrated efficacy in the population of previously SARS-CoV-2 infected 
participants with 75.9% VE (95% CI 62.7; 84.9) in mFAS-PD1 Non-Naïve (first vaccination dose) and 
75.1% VE (95% CI 56.3; 86.6) in mFAS-PD2 Non-Naïve (second vaccination dose). Study VAT0008 
Stage 2 could not demonstrate efficacy in mFAS-PD2 Naïve D01+D22. In view of lack of 
immunogenicity data from VAT00008, results from study VAT0008 Stage 2 cannot be compared to 
results from VAT0002 or VAT0013 and can therefore not be considered supportive to draw any 
conclusion on efficacy of VidPrevtyn Beta. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the clinical efficacy issues  
•  To support the lack of data in the elderly, the applicant should provide immunogenicity and 
safety data on this population from two currently ongoing studies (ancillary study VAT00013 
and NIH-initiated study) as soon as results are available (by 31 March 2022) 
• 
Immunogenicity results (nAB GMTs) against D614G and VOCs, in particular against SARS-CoV-
2 Omicron variants BA.4/BA.5, from participants in study VAT0008 Stage 2 should be provided. 
The analysis sets mFAS-PD1 Non-Naïve and mFAS-PD2 Non-Naïve are considered the most 
appropriate sets for comparison. Data from the naïve population should also be provided (31 
March 2022). 
•  To support the lack of data in immunocompromised individuals, the Applicant should provide 
immunogenicity and safety data on this population from the two planned studies (VAT00027 
and VAT00028) as soon as results are available (by 31 December 2023).

Summary of exposure to CoV2 preS dTM AS03 (B.1.351) Vaccine  
In total 7798 participants received at least 1 dose of CoV2 preS dTM AS03 (B.1.351) containing 
vaccine as following:  
•  705 participants received a single booster dose of 5 μg of MV CoV2 preS dTM AS03 (B.1.351) 
vaccine. 
•  621 participants received a single booster dose of 5 μg of BV CoV2 preS dTM AS03 
(D614+B.1.351) vaccine. 
•  6472 participants received at least 1 dose of 10 μg CoV2 preS dTM AS03 (D614+B.1.351) 
vaccine as a primary series. 
Regarding the age stratification: (96.2%) participants were in the 18-64 years age group, (3.1%) were 
in the 65-74 years age group, (0.6%) in the 75-84 years age group, and 10 (0.1%) were in the >=85 
years age group.

Supplemental Cohort 2 Booster Groups 
Overall, in the SafAS, the proportion of participants with at least one high-risk medical condition was 
comparable across the mRNA platform primed groups and the Oxford/AstraZeneca primed groups 
(ranging from 50% of participants in the monovalent boosted-Oxford/AstraZeneca primed group to 
62.2% of the monovalent boosted-Moderna primed group). Participants in the J&J/Janssen primed 
groups (78.9% in the bivalent boosted group, 84.2% in the monovalent boosted group) and the 
Protein primed group (80.8%) had higher proportions of participants with at least 1 high-risk medical 
condition. The most common high-risk medical condition was obesity, 36.5% and 34.8% in the MV and 
BV booster groups, respectively. Overall, the most common (> 5% of participants) high-risk medical 
conditions after obesity were smoking (18,7%, 20.1%), hypertension/high blood pressure (20.4%, 
16.1%), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (9.8%, 5.0%) in MV and BV booster groups, respectively.  
In study VAT00008 – stage 2, the proportion of participants was well balanced across vaccine and 
placebo groups. The proportion of males was higher compared to females. The mean age was 36.1 
(12.8) years, and similar in both treatment groups. Approximately 94% of participants were aged 
between 18 and 59 years.  Mostly of the participants were SARS-CoV-2 non-naïves at baseline for both

treatment groups. The most common high-risk medical conditions (≥ 5% of participants) were 
smoking, obesity, and immunocompromised state from other causes. Overall, the proportion of 
participants having risk factors for severe COVID-19 was similar between treatment groups.  
Table 54: Demographics of the safety population - SafAS 
In study VAT00013, 247 participants were enrolled: 85 participants in CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (D614) 
booster group, 80 participants in CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) booster group, and 82 participants in 
Pfizer/BioNTech booster group. The mean age of participants was similar between vaccine groups. 
There were less females than males in the two booster groups while in Group 1 (Pfizer/BioNTech 
booster vaccine group), the gender proportion was balanced. The interval between the second dose of 
the primary series and the booster dose was 174 days (approximately 5.8 months) and was 
comparable across groups. The most common high-risk medical conditions associated with increased 
risk of severe COVID-19 (≥ 4.5%) were smoking, obesity, and hypertension.

In study VAT00002- Phase III, within 7 days after a booster injection 77.1% in the MV (B.1.351) 
vaccine groups and 78.4% participants in the BV (D614 + B.1.351) vaccine group experienced at least 
one local ARs, of which 3.3% and 1.9%, respectively, were of Grade 3 intensity.   
The most common reported local AR was ‘Pain’ experienced by 76.2% and 77.8%, respectively, of all 
Booster Group participants, 2.9% and 1.8%, respectively, were of Grade 3 intensity, followed by 
swelling and erythema. The majority of solicited injection site reactions were of Grade 1 or 2 
intensities, occurred within 3 days and resolved spontaneously within 1 to 3 days. All Grade 3 solicited 
injection site reactions for both vaccine groups occurred within 3 days.  
Regarding age groups, more participants aged 18-55 years experienced solicited injection site 
reactions (83.1% and 84.3% for MV and BV vaccines, respectively) than those ≥56 years of age 
(63.2% and 58.0% for MV and BV vaccines, respectively).  
An overview of all local solicited ARs and the grade 3 ARs are summarized in the table below:

Solicited systemic ARs 
In the MV (B.1.351) or BV (D614 + B.1.351) vaccines groups within 7 days after a booster injection, 
60.0% and 64.8% of participants, respectively, experienced at least one solicited systemic AR, of 
which 6.9% and 6.3%, respectively, were of Grade 3 intensity. The most frequently reported solicited 
systemic reactions in the MV and BV vaccines’ all Booster Groups were headache (41.4% and 43.0% of 
participants), myalgia (37.8% and 41.9%), and malaise (33.0% and 33.1%). The majority of solicited 
systemic reactions were of Grade 1-2 and occurred within 3 days. The majority of Grade 3 systemic 
ARs occurred within the first 4 days after vaccination and lasted between 1-3 days.  
Regarding the age groups: more participants aged 18-55 years experienced solicited systemic ARs 
(66.1% and 69.2% for MV and BV vaccines, respectively) than those ≥ 56 years of age (45.9% and 
49.3% for MV and BV vaccines, respectively). The rates were comparable in frequency in each Booster 
Group with younger adults reporting more solicited systemic reactions than older adults.

Participants without a high-risk medical condition reported a higher frequency of (local and systemic) 
solicited AEs (89.8%) than participants with such conditions (78.2%). 
Study VAT00008 – Stage 2 
Solicited local ARs 
Overall, the frequency of solicited injection site ARs after any injection was higher in BV (D614 + 
B.1.351) vaccine group compared to placebo (46.7% vs. 26.8%, respectively). Lower frequencies of 
these events were reported after the 2nd injection compared to the 1st dose in the vaccine group 
(31.7% versus 35.6% participants). In the Placebo Group these ARs were similar after the 1st and 2nd 
dose (17.1% and 16.7% participants). Pain was the most frequently reported ARs in the vaccine group 
(46.2%) compared to placebo group (26.6%), followed by swelling (4.9% versus 0.5%, respectively) 
and erythema (1.9% versus 0.3%).   
Most of the solicited local AR were of Grade 1- 2 intensity in both groups and Grade 3 events were 
4.1% in the vaccine group vs 1.8% in the placebo group. In both groups, after any injection, most 
reactions started within 3 days and resolved spontaneously after 1 to 3 days.

Solicited systemic ARs 
Overall, the frequency of solicited systemic ARs after any injection was higher in BV (D614 + B.1.351) 
vaccine group compared to placebo group, respectively (45.5% versus 34.2%). In the vaccine group, a 
comparable proportion of participants reported solicited systemic reactions after the 1st and 2nd 
injections (33.8% and 30.4% participants, respectively). Participants reported headache, malaise, 
myalgia, arthralgia, and chills at a similar frequency after each injection. The frequency of fever was 
low (≤4.5%) and was comparable after the 1st and 2nd injections. Most of the solicited systemic 
reactions were of Grade 1 and Grade 2 intensity in the vaccine and placebo groups. The proportion of 
participants in the vaccine group who reported Grade 3 solicited systemic reactions was comparable 
between the 1st and 2nd injections (4.3% and 4.0%participants, respectively). The proportion of 
participants reporting Grade 3 fever was ≤ 0.8%. In both groups, after any injection, most reactions 
started within 3 days and resolved spontaneously after 1 to 3 days.

Headache was the most frequently reported solicited systemic reaction after any injection in the 
vaccine group (32.9%) and placebo group (26.4%) followed by malaise (27.5 % in the vaccine and 
21.0% in the placebo group), myalgia (25% in the vaccine group and 17.7% in the placebo group) and 
arthralgia (23 % in the vaccine group and 16.4% in the placebo group). Grade 3 headache, malaise, 
myalgia, arthralgia, and chills were reported at similar frequencies, ranging from 1.3% to 2.3%. There 
was no increase overall in reporting of grade 3 solicited systemic reactions after the second dose 
(4.3% versus 4%). The majority of solicited systemic reactions occurred within 3 days and resolved 
spontaneously within 1 to 3 days). 1.0% of participants or less per solicited reaction and per study 
group had systemic reactions still ongoing at D09 after any injection. The applicant has responded to 
questions raised for the D164 variant that “as unblinding was performed at treatment level and not at 
individual participant level it is not possible to assign individually events to the vaccine or placebo 
groups”. That the unblinding is not performed down to individual level hampers the current safety 
evaluation also for the BV vaccine evaluated in VAT0008 stage 2 as it is not possible for most cases to 
identify which AE with narrative belonged to vaccinated or placebo group.

Unsolicited AEs and ARs 
There were no reports of immediate unsolicited AEs including unsolicited ARs after the booster injection 
of MV CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) or BV CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (D614 + B.1.351) vaccines. 
Within 21 days after the booster injection of MV CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) or BV CoV2 preS dTM-
AS03 (D614 + B.1.351) vaccines, the overall proportion of participants who experienced at least one 
unsolicited AE was 23.1% and 24.8% respectively, with Grade 3 unsolicited AEs being 2.4% and 3.1%, 
respectively. The most frequently reported unsolicited AEs for the MV and BV vaccine groups were 
cough (4.4% and 5.3%, respectively), fatigue (4.1% and 3.7%, respectively), rhinorrhoea (3.7% and 
3.5%, respectively), and headache (3.4% for both groups).  
Participants 18-55 years of age experienced more unsolicited AEs (27.2%) than those aged ≥56 years

No participant in the booster groups had an AE/AR that lead to discontinuation. 
Medically Attended Adverse Events (MAAE) 
In the MV (B.1.351) booster group, 23 participants reported 27 MAAEs up to 21 days after booster 
injection, The proportion of participants was highest in the mRNA platform primed groups (15 
participants, 17 MAAEs), followed by the Protein primed group (5 total participants, 7 total MAAEs), 
and the Ad-vector platform primed groups (3 total participants, 3 total MAAEs). “Infections and 
infestations” was the SOC in which the highest number of participants (11) reported a total of 11 
MAAEs. Three participants experienced in total 5 MAAEs that were assessed as related to the 
investigational product. The related events were all recovered/resolved. The MAAEs considered related 
were tinnitus, arthralgia, myalgia, headache and eczema. 
In the BV (D614 + B.1.351) Booster Groups, 20 participants (all in the mRNA platform primed groups) 
reported 36 MAAEs up to 21 days after booster. The group that reported the highest number of MAAEs 
was the Pfizer/BioNTech primed group with 16 participants reporting 32 total MAAEs. Overall, 
“Infections and infestations” was the SOC in which the highest number of participants (10) reported a 
total of 11 MAAEs. One participant, in the Moderna primed group, experienced 1 MAAE (serum 
sickness-like reaction) that was assessed as related to the investigational product. The related event 
resolved. 
Adverse events of special interest according to study protocol 
The list of AESI used in the clinical study diverged significantly from the list of AESIs that will be used 
post-marketing. 
AESIs according to the clinical study protocol include anaphylactic reactions, generalized convulsion, 
myocarditis, pericarditis, thrombocytopenia, thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome and pIMDs 
(potential immune-mediated diseases). A listing of pIMDs of special interest was made available. 
The Applicant reported: 
•  One protein-primed participant receiving MV (B.1.351) booster experienced trigeminal 
neuralgia that was assessed as unrelated to the study vaccine by the investigator. Outcome: 
resolving 
The participant presented with neuralgia and tinnitus one day after booster injection. The 
symptoms started after a dental procedure. A neurologist diagnosed the patient with trigeminal 
neuralgia. It was reported that the event was probably due to aging (age above 75) and a 
maxillofacial problem. The patient’s medical history included neuralgia in the face treated with 
pregabalin without improvement.

•  27 participants reported AESI from the RMP list in the MV (B.1.351) group (3.8%). None of 
them were assessed as related. 
•  29 participants reported AESI form the RMP list in the BV (D614+B.1.351) group (4.7%). One 
of them was considered as related, a non-serious case of chilblains in a 20-29-year-old. He 
experienced chilblains (Grade 1) 21 days after vaccination. The participant recovered from the 
event after 13 days without any action taken.  
In both groups, the most frequently reported events were COVID-19 (19 out 21 in the MV (B.1.351) 
vaccine. group, 22 out 27 in the BV (D614 + B.1.351) vaccine group). 
Study VAT00008 – Stage 2 
Unsolicited AEs and ARs 
There were 11 immediate unsolicited AEs reported by a total of 11 participants (4 in the BV CoV2 preS 
dTM-AS03 [D614 + B.1.351] vaccine group and 7 in the placebo group) after any injection. Eight 
participants reported immediate unsolicited AEs after the first injection, and 3 participants after the 
second injection. All immediate unsolicited AEs were non-serious events. Four (< 0.1%) participants in 
the vaccine group and 6 (< 0.1%) participants in the placebo group reported immediate events that 
were assessed as related to the vaccine/procedure. No event was of Grade 3 intensity.  
Within 21 days after any injection, the proportion of participants who reported at least 1 unsolicited AE 
was 6.3% for the vaccine group and 8.1% for the placebo group. No participants reported Grade 3 
unsolicited AEs within this time period. The proportion of participants who reported at least 1 
unsolicited AE after the first injection was 4.0% in the vaccine group and 4.7% in the placebo group. 
The proportion of participants who reported at least 1 unsolicited AE after the second injection was 
3.4% in the vaccine group and 4.4% in the placebo group. 
Participants ≥ 65 years of age (9.6% for the vaccine group and 9.2% in the placebo group) reported 
unsolicited AEs more frequently than participants 18 to 64 years of age (6.1% for the vaccine group 
and 8.0% for the placebo group). 
Assessment report  
EMA/893684/2022

Within 21 days after any injection, the proportion of participants who reported at least 1 unsolicited AE 
was slightly higher in naïve participants in both the vaccine and placebo groups (7.8% and 10.8%, 
respectively) compared to non-naïve participants (6.3% and 7.8%, respectively). 
Among participants with a high-risk medical condition, those in the vaccine group reported a slightly 
lower frequency of unsolicited AEs than participants in the placebo group (7.7% and 10.4%, 
respectively). Across both study intervention groups, participants without a high-risk medical condition 
reported a lower frequency of unsolicited AEs than those with a high-risk medical condition. 
When comparing the unsolicited AE frequencies from VAT0008 stage 2 BV  (D614 + B.1.135)  primary 
vaccination indication to the MV  booster (B.1.135) in VAT0002 supplemental phase III cohort 2 the 
frequencies where much lower in the primary vaccination scheme in VAT00008 in line with what was 
also seen for MV D164 vaccine that was evaluated in VAT0008 stage one. Difference in study design 
(placebo versus no use of placebo group), difference in serostatus and differences in participating 
countries (different geographical regions) may have played a role for the observed discrepancies. 
The reporting frequencies of AE varied for different races in VAT0008 for vaccinated and placebo 
recipients respectively: Asian participants (0.8% and 2%), Black or African American participants 
(8.8% and 10.7%), American Indian or Alaska Native participants (5.9% and 16.7%) and White 
participants (50% and 35.7%). 
The same tendency is seen for VAT0008 stage 2 that the AE frequency in the white population is much 
higher than for the other races as seen for VAT00008 stage 1. However, only a small number of white 
participants was included in VAT0008 stage 1 and 2.   
The frequency of participants reporting unsolicited ARs within 21 days after any injection was low, with 
19 (0.8%) participants in the vaccine group experiencing 28 unsolicited ARs and 16 (0.7%) 
participants in the placebo group experiencing 25 unsolicited ARs.

Medically attended adverse events (MAAEs)  
Up to the analysis cut-off date, the proportion of participants who reported at least 1 MAAE was similar 
in both treatment groups. A total of 751 participants (366 in the Vaccine Group and 385 in the Placebo 
Group) reported 1121 MAAEs (560 in the Vaccine Group and 561 in the Placebo Group). Among these, 
18 participants reported at least 1 MAAE assessed as related to study intervention (11 in the Vaccine 
Group, 7 in the Placebo Group). No related MAAE was assessed as serious. 
Related MAAE was 13 in the vaccine group and 8 in the Placebo Group.

There was one case of heavy menstrual bleeding reported in the vaccinated group in VAT0008 stage 2 
that was medically attended evaluated to be not related. The case described a woman in her 30s that 
experienced heavy menstrual bleeding 10 days after first vaccine dose, and the event lasted for 
approximately 2 months and required medical attention and medication. Heavy menstrual bleeding is 
newly identified as an ADR after vaccination with two other COVID-19 vaccines (Comirnaty and 
Spikevax). As the mechanisms is still not clear this could potentially be relevant for Vidprevtyn Beta 
also. However, the data from the clinical studies is too limited to draw any conclusion and the applicant 
has been asked to follow heavy menstrual bleedings in summary safety reports. 
Adverse events of special interest according to study protocol 
The list of AESI used in the clinical study diverged significantly from the list of AESIs that will be used 
post-marketing. 
AESIs include anaphylactic reactions, generalized convulsion, myocarditis, pericarditis, 
thrombocytopenia, thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome and pIMDs (potential immune-
mediated diseases). A listing of pIMDs of special interest was made available. 
Up to the analysis cut-off date, when the AESI list according to the clinical study protocol was used, a 
total of 2 participants (1 [< 0.1%] in the BV CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 [D614 + B.1.351] vaccine group 
and 1 [< 0.1%] in the placebo group) reported a total of 3. 2 AESIs were reported in 1 participant 
(alcoholic seizure and seizure) and alcoholic seizure was reported for another participant. None of the 
AESIs were assessed as related to the study intervention. 
There were no potentially immune-mediated medical conditions or diseases (pIMDs) reported. 
AESIs according to the RMP list that will be used postmarketing: Guillain-Barre syndrome, acute 
disseminated encephalomyelitis transversal myelitis, bell’s palsy, narcolepsy, acute aseptic arthritis, 
rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, (idiopathic) thrombocytopenia, microangiopathy (including 
thrombotic microangiopathy), heart failure, stress cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, 
arrhythmia, myocarditis/pericarditis, single organ cutaneous vasculitis, disseminated intravascular 
coagulation, venous thromboembolism (including pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis), 
haemorrhagic stroke, ischemic stroke, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, thrombotic thrombocytopenia 
syndrome, thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura, acute liver injury, acute kidney injury including 
glomerulonephritis, generalized convulsion, meningoencephalitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome,

For primary vaccination 103 participants reported an AESIs: 1 acute respiratory distress, 80 COVID-19 
related cases, 13 conjunctivitis, 4 arthritis, 2 conjunctivitis allergic, 2 seizure, 1 eye pain, 1 Lacrimation 
increased, and 1 vision blurred. AESIs was reported by 99 participants in the placebo group: 1 Hepatic 
failure, anaphylactic reaction, 93 COVID-19 cases, 1 diabetes mellitus, 2 arthritis, 1 Azotaemia, 5 
conjunctivitis, 3 conjunctivitis allergic, 1 eye pain, 2 Lacrimation increased, 1 eye pruritus, 1 
hordeolum. One case of vision blurred, and 19 cases of suspected COVID-19 was listed as related. 
Study VAT00013  
Unsolicited AEs and ARs 
Unsolicited adverse events were collected within 28 days after MV CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) 
booster vaccination. 29 (36.3%) participants reported at least 1 unsolicited AE, and in total 40 
unsolicited AE were reported for (B.1.351). The unsolicited AEs were of Grade 1 / Grade 2 intensity or 
mild / moderate intensity. 
Table 64: Study VAT00013: Unsolicited adverse events by preferred term for the three groups 
There were 14 AEs evaluated as related to MV CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) booster vaccination, all 
of them were mild to moderate, 13 recovered within 6 days, and one case of hypertension, starting 5 
days post booster administration, was reported as ongoing at D28.

14 events assessed as related to the MV CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (D614) booster vaccine, all of them 
were mild to moderate, 12 recovered within 10 days, and 2 events were reported as unchanged at D28 
(Moderate neck pain case starting 2 days post booster administration and moderate musculoskeletal 
pain starting 13 days post booster administration). 
15 events assessed as related to the Pfizer/BioNTech booster vaccine, all were mild to moderate and 
most of them resolved within 10 days.

Medically attended adverse events (MAAEs)  
Medically attended AEs (MAAEs) were not specifically reported as such during this study, as described 
in the clinical study protocol. Four events required generalist physician contact, however none of the 
non-serious AEs led to hospitalization. 
Cases evaluated to be related for B.1.351 booster was Hypertension, abdominal discomfort, nasal 
inflammation grade 1, hot flush x 2, premenstrual pain, eczema, Pyrexia, pain in the extremity, 
Injection site haemorrhage, Haematoma, paresthesia, Hypoaesthesia, menstrual disorder. 
Cases evaluated to be related for D614 booster: Dry mouth, cough, Influenza like illness, Rhinorrhoea, 
Oropharyngeal pain, withdrawal bleed, Dizziness, Vertigo, Odynophagia, pyrexia, neck pain, feeling 
hot, musculoskeletal pain, and nasal dryness. 
Cases evaluated to be related for Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine: Cough, Blepharospasm, foreign body 
sensation in eyes, lymphopenia, blepharitis, vaginal haemorrhage, injection site haemorrhage, 
menstruation delayed, paraesthesia, hyperhidrosis, feeling hot, pyrexia, chest discomfort, Heavy 
menstrual bleeding, and Gastroenteritis. 
Adverse events of special interest 
For VAT00013 two AESI were reported: 1 related case of “flare-up of rheumatoid arthritis” and one 
case of “mild eye pain”, assessed as not related by the investigator.   
Pooled safety analyses  
The Applicant presents the following pooled treatment groups for the pooled safety analysis:  
a)  5μg MV(B.1.351) Booster: all participants receiving one injection of 5 μg CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 
MV(B.1.351) antigen in Study VAT00002 Supplemental Cohort 2 Main Arms (Exploratory Arms 
excluded) 
b)  5μg BV(D614+B.1.351) Booster: all participants receiving one injection of 5 μg CoV2 preS 
dTM-AS03 BV(D614+B.1.351) antigen in Study VAT00002 Supplemental Cohort 2 Main Arms 
c)  Pooled Booster: all participants receiving one injection of 5 μg CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 MV 
(B.1.351) or BV(D614+B.1.351) antigen in Study VAT00002 Supplemental Cohort 2 Main Arms 
d)  10μg BV(D614+B.1.351): all participants receiving at least one injection of 10 μg CoV2 preS 
dTM-AS03 BV(D614+B.1.351) antigen as primary series in Study VAT00008 Stage 2 
e)  Total B.1.351 Vaccine: a combined group of all participants receiving at least one injection of 
CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 vaccine as a booster of 5μg MV (B.1.351) or 5μg BV (D614+B.1.351) 
antigen in Study VAT00002 Supplemental Cohort 2 Main Arms or as primary series of 10 μg 
CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 BV(D614+B.1.351) antigen in Study VAT00008 Stage 2 
f)  Placebo: the group of participants receiving at least one injection of placebo over the course of 
Study VAT00008 Stage 2 
VAT00013 has not been included in any pool based on the following reasons: 
• 
solicited reactions follow up time were not the same, 21 days for VAT00002 and VAT00008 
versus 28 days in VAT000013,  
self-reported diary cards were not used in VAT00013.  
For VAT00002 and VAT00008 the FDA scale was used for registering solicited AEs. VAT00013 
also used the FDA scale, but it was supplemented with the WHO scale for symptoms not 
• 
• 
Assessment report  
EMA/893684/2022

present in the FDA scale. Accordingly, the list of solicited symptoms was more comprehensive 
for this study. 
Based on the differences above the applicant has not used the safety data from VAT00013 to support 
the safety profile described in the SmPC. 
In VAT00008, reactogenicity (solicited reactions and unsolicited adverse events up to 21 days after 
vaccination) was only captured in the reactogenicity subset (n=2433) which is a subset of the Safety 
Analysis Set (SafAS).In VAT00002 reactogenicity was captured in the entire SafAS. Interpretation of 
results compared across the pooled treatment groups needs to take this study design into account. 
When using the complete SafAS when pooling data from VAT00008 and VAT00002, frequencies of AEs 
will be underestimated. 
A total of 7798 participants received at least 1 dose of a vaccine containing CoV2 preS dTM AS03 
(B.1.351) in a monovalent or bivalent formulation. 
Among these participants: 
•  705 participants received a single booster dose of 5 μg MV CoV2 preS dTM AS03 (B.1.351) 
vaccine. Safety follow up time was at least 2 months for 610 participants. 
•  621 participants received a single booster dose of 5 μg BV CoV2 preS dTM AS03 
(D614+B.1.351) vaccine. Safety follow up time was at least 2 months for 546 participants. 
•  6472 participants received at least 1 dose of 10 μg BV CoV2 preS dTM AS03 (D614+B.1.351) 
vaccine as a primary series. Safety follow up time was at least 2 months for 2731 of the 
participants. 
In addition, 6450 participants who received placebo during the VAT00008 Stage 2 study are included in 
the analysis, and of them 2722 have been followed for at least two months after the last injection.  
After injection and up to the data cut-off date, the number of participants who reported at least 1 AE in 
the Total B.1.351 Vaccine group and the Placebo group was as follows: a total of 2808 (36.0%) 
participants in the Total B.1.351 Vaccine group and a total of 1300 (20.2%) participants in the Placebo 
group. In the 10 μg BV (D614+B.1. 351) Primary Series group, the number of participants who 
reported at least 1 AE was 1682 (26.0%).  
In the Pooled Booster MV (B.1.351) + BV (D614+B.1.351) group, the number of participants who 
reported at least 1 AE was 1126 (84.9%). This consisted of 592 (84.0%) participants in the 5 μg MV 
(B.1.351) Booster group and 534 (86.0%) in the 5 μg BV (D614+B.1.351) Booster group.  
Overall, adverse events were reported at similar rates between the two booster groups (5 μg MV 
(B.1.351) Booster group and 5 μg BV (D614+B.1.351) Booster group). Individual system organ classes 
(SOC) were also reported at similar rates between the two booster groups. As expected, the most 
frequently reported SOCs in MV and BV groups were those that contained PTs associated with solicited 
reactions, i.e., General disorders and administration site conditions (MV: 559 participants (79.3%); 
BV: 501 participants (80.7%)), Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (MV: 322 participants 
(45.7%); BV: 307 participants (49.4%)), and Nervous system disorders (MV: 301 participants 
(42.7%); BV: 277 participants (44.6%)). 
As regards related adverse events (adverse reactions), the number of participants who reported at 
least 1 Adverse Reaction (AR) in the Total B.1.351 Vaccine group and the Placebo group was as 
follows: a total of 2602 (33.4%) participants in the Total B.1.351 Vaccine group and a total of 1049 
(16.3%) participants in the Placebo group. In the Pooled Booster MV (B.1.351) + BV (D614+B.1.351) 
group, the number of participants who reported at least 1 AR was 1102 (83.1%). This consisted of 576 
(81.7%) participants in the 5 μg MV (B.1.351) Booster group and 526 (84.7%) in the 5 μg BV 
Assessment report

(D614+B.1.351) Booster group. In the 10 μg BV (D614+B.1. 351) Primary Series group, the number 
of participants who reported at least 1 AR was 1500 (23.2%).  
Overall, adverse reactions were reported at similar rates between the two booster groups (5 μg MV 
(B.1.351) Booster group and 5 μg BV (D614+B.1.351) Booster group). Individual system organ classes 
(SOC) of ARs were also reported at similar rates between the two booster groups. These included 
General disorder and administration site conditions (MV: 558 participants (79.1%); BV: 499 
participants (80.4%)), Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (MV: 310 participants (44.0%); 
BV: 299 participants (48.1%)), and Nervous system disorders (MV: 287 participants (40.7%); BV: 267 
participants (43.0%)). 
Differences in AE reporting frequencies between studies VAT00002 Supplemental Phase III Cohort 2 
and VAT00008 stage 2. 
Table 66: Summary safety table for Studies VAT00002 – Supplemental Phase III Cohort 2 and 
VAT00008 – Stage 2 after any injection up to data cut-off date

Page 156/185 
 
 
 
 
There is a high discrepancy in the frequencies of adverse event reported in VAT0008 stage 2 
reactogenicity subset compared to VAT0002 Supplemental Cohort 2. This is in line with what was seen 
for the parental vaccine MV (D614) in that frequencies of adverse events were much lower in VAT0008 
stage 1 compared to VAT00002 Supplemental Cohort 1 especially for unsolicited AEs. It is unknown if 
the large difference in reporting frequencies of AEs is caused by differences in; previous COVID-19 
infection status, differences in AE reporting between geographical regions, differences in study design, 
booster vaccination versus primary vaccination or bivalent versus monovalent formulation. All these 
uncertainties make the data from VAT0008 difficult to use without introducing some bias. 
Calculation of frequencies of adverse reactions in section 4.8 of the SmPC is based on the 705 
participants receiving 5 µg MV (B.1.351) vaccine. For a sample size of 705 participants, it is only 
possible to estimate frequencies of common ADRs (frequency (≥1/100)).  
The safety profile observed with the MV (B.1.351) booster group is similar to the safety profile 
observed in the larger safety dataset of participants having received beta-containing formulations of 
the vaccine (N=3759). This extended safety dataset consists of both booster cohorts (MV and BV) and 
the reactogenicity subset of VAT00008 stage 2. 
Table 67: Frequencies of adverse reactions calculated based on the Vidprevtyn Beta safety database 
(n=705) and based on an extended safety database with pooled beta containing vaccines (n=3759) 
In general, most of the ADRs are reported with higher frequencies in the Vidprevtyn Beta safety set 
than in the extended safety database set of pooled Beta containing vaccines (n=3759). Pooling of data 
from Booster and primary vaccination introduces uncertainty in the frequency estimates. Frequencies 
of adverse reactions in section 4.8 of the SmPC is therefore based on the Vidprevtyn Beta booster 
safety database. 
Cardiac related AEs in the pooled dataset for Vidprevtyn Beta 
There are no reported events of pericarditis or myocarditis in the studies evaluated. In the pooled MV 
(B.1.351) and BV (D614+B.1.351) booster group from VAT00002, there were in the SOC cardiac 
disorders registered 10 AE (4 angina pectoris, 1 atrial fibrillation, 2 palpitations and 3 tachycardia). 
One case of palpitation was evaluated as related to the study-vaccine. There were in addition 2 cases 
Assessment report  
EMA/893684/2022  
Page 157/185 
 
 
 
 
of chest discomfort, 2 cases of chest pain where one was related (MV B.1.351) and 4 cases of “non-
cardiac chest pain” where one was related (MV B.1.351). 
For the BV (D614+B.1.351) primary vaccination group from VAT0008 stage 2, there were in the SOC 
cardiac disorders reported, one case of Rheumatic heart disease registered in the vaccine group and 1 
angina pectoris in the placebo group. There were also one related case of hypertension in the vaccine- 
and 1 related case of hypertension in the Placebo-group. There were in addition 4 cases of “non-
cardiac chest pain” in the vaccine group versus 2 in the placebo-group where none was evaluated to be 
related. 
Pooled safety interim data from VAT00002 Supplemental Phase III Cohort 1 and VAT00008 stage 1 
Interim data from another ongoing cohort, VAT00002 Supplemental Phase III Cohort 1 (n= 803) and 
interim data from VAT00008 stage 1 (5061 vaccinated, and 5078 in placebo group) investigating 
boosting and primary vaccination with the parental vaccine (D614) was evaluated in the context of 
VidPrevtyn (D614) aiming to be used for primary immunisation and booster. Except for differing 
antigens, this vaccine has the same composition, including adjuvant (AS03).  As supportive, the 
applicant provided the full dataset for all ages and pool data from the VAT00008 and VAT00002 studies 
for the (D614) variant as this information is also considered relevant for evaluation of safety of the 
booster vaccine MV (B.1.351). 
The Applicant has provided a new data cut (May 2022). The applicant has provided pooled data for 
heterologous booster (n=671), homolog booster (n=132), pooled booster (n=803), primary series 
(n=6109) and total MV(D614) Vaccine (n=6916). Imbalances have been observed between vaccinated 
and placebo (primary vaccination) on PT and SOC level for adverse events reported.  
For instance, for nervous system disorders there were imbalances seen for primary vaccination for 
related AEs for both paraesthesia (4 (0.1%) in vaccine group versus 0 in Placebo) and dizziness 
(11(0.3%) in vaccine group versus 1 (less than 0.1%) in placebo). These are known ADR for other 
COVID-19 vaccines. The applicant initially identified dizziness and swelling face would have been listed 
as ADRs in the SmPC for the D614 however these AR are not listed for VidPrevtyn Beta, intended to be 
used as a booster only.  
For the SOC skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders there is an imbalance on the SOC level for primary 
vaccination where 14 (0.4%) reported related AE in the SOC after vaccination versus 2 (less than 
0.1%) in Placebo. Related events of Pruritus and rash was reported by 3 and 4 participants versus 0 in 
Placebo.  
For related AEs there were 4 (0.1%) cases of Insomnia in the primary vaccination group versus 0 in 
Placebo. 
According to the applicant no additional adverse reaction is identified, when compared to the list of 
adverse reactions listed in the MV (B.1.351) booster vaccine SmPC.  
Based on the data presented the applicant should in the monthly reports have special monitoring on 
dizziness, swelling face/angioedema and paraesthesia as these are adverse reactions that are seen for 
the D614 variant, and it is plausible that can be adverse reactions for the MV (B.1.351) booster that 
can manifest when more individuals are vaccinated.

In the monovalent (B.1.351) Booster Groups, a total of 8 participants reported 8 SAEs, assessed as not 
related to the study vaccine.  
In the bivalent (D614 + B.1.351) Booster Groups: 9 participants (6 Pfizer/BioNTech primed, 1 Moderna 
primed, and 2 J&J/Janssen primed) reported a total of 10 SAEs.  
One participant, primed with the Moderna vaccine in the 18-55 years age group, experienced 1 SAE 
(Serum sickness-like reaction). The event was assessed as related to the study vaccine by the 
Investigator and unrelated by the sponsor. The narrative shows a time of onset, 11 days, that makes it 
likely to be related, and no alternative causes were reported. The outcome of the SAE was reported as 
resolved. 
The other SAEs reported for the BV booster was assessed as not related to the study vaccine. 
VAT00008- Stage 2  
Until the data cut of March 2022 there were 30 participants (0.5%) in the bivalent (D614 + B.1.351) 
group that reported an SAE compared to 26 (0.4%) in placebo. In total there was 85 SAE, 44 were in 
the vaccine group and 41 in placebo, and none were related to study intervention.  
The frequency of SAEs was lower in the 18 to 59 years age group compared to the ≥60 years age 
group, both in the Vaccine and the Placebo Groups. The frequency of SAEs was comparable in the 
Vaccine Group compared to the Placebo Group. 
One participant in the Vaccine Group reported an SAE of hypertensive crisis that was assessed as not 
related to the investigational product. Time to onset of the event was 86 days after the second study 
vaccination. 
No SAEs were reported for thromboembolic events, myocarditis/ pericarditis, anaphylactic shock/shock 
and narcolepsy. 
VAT00013 
Three SAEs were recorded for this study, one in each group: 
• 
In the group receiving MV B.1.351 one participant showed Arthralgia, Myalgia and pain in the 
extremities 5 days after the vaccination as a flare-up of a known rheumatoid arthritis. The 
event is considered related and the participant is also considered to have been erroneously 
included in the study. The event is resolved after hospitalization and corticosteroid therapy. 
•  The second related SAE in a subject of the MV D614 group was a case of appendicitis 15 days 
after the vaccination. The report attributes this also causally to the vaccination as an 
inflammation of a lymphatic organ.    
•  The case in the Comirnaty group is malaise with loss of consciousness. It occurred 45 days 
post vaccination and 3 days after a "sleeve gastrectomy" in a 20-29-year-old obese and 
hypothyroid person supplemented with levothyroxine. Due to the possible linkage of 
thromboembolic events with that vaccine the seen spleen infarct is considered possibly related 
to the vaccination although this specific gastrectomy also has it as a rare event. 
Deaths 
In studies VAT00002 -Supplemental Phase III Cohort 2 and VAT00013, there were no deaths reported 
in participants who received the MV (B.1.351) or the BV MV (D614 + B.1.351). 
In Stage 2 of study VAT00008, a total of 10 participants died, 4 in the Vaccine Group and 6 in the 
Placebo Group. None of the deaths were reported as related to the study vaccine.  
Assessment report  
EMA/893684/2022

The fatal cases in the vaccine group regarding the reported PT were: 
•  Chronic kidney disease in a 30-39-year-old participant, on haemodialysis for more than 6 years 
at the time of the event. Worsening of chronic renal failure reported, time to onset was more 
than 3 months after second study vaccination. 
•  Acute respiratory distress syndrome in a 50-59-year-old participant 42 days after the second 
injection of study intervention. The cause of death was reported as severe pneumonia. A PCR 
test for COVID-19 was negative. 
•  Angioedema in a 40-49-year-old participant with ongoing medical history of HIV (under 
antiretroviral treatment) and goiter. The participant became very ill 43 days after receiving the 
first injection of study intervention and within 1-2 hours after taking a single dose of 
carbimazole and propranolol and died. The suspected cause of death was angioedema to 
carbimazole. 
•

2.5.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
Laboratory results are available for a Phase 1 study (VAT00001), but not for the Phase 2/3 trials. This 
is acceptable. No Grade 2 or 3 events were seen for the following laboratory measurements: AP, ALT, 
AST, Neutrophils, Leukocytes, Lymphocytes, Eosinophils, Sodium – Hyponatremia, Potassium – 
Hyperkalaemia, Creatinine.  
2.5.8.5.  Safety in special populations 
Pregnancy and lactating women 
Up to the analysis cut-off date of VAT00008 – stage 2, 49 participants reported a pregnancy. 24/49 
pregnancies are ongoing, 3/49 pregnancies reported a normal delivery, 1/49 with unknown pregnancy 
outcome and 1/49 participant did not receive vaccine or placebo. 
Overall, 20/49 cases reporting early pregnancy termination: 
•  6 were induced, elective abortions 
•  1 was an ectopic pregnancy 
•  6 had a reported spontaneous abortion with underlying cause or confounding factors 
•  7 had reported spontaneous abortion with no underlying cause or information was not supplied 
Four of the 13 abnormal pregnancy terminations included cases where the participant had taken herbal 
concoction (2 cases), cannabis abuse/HIV (1 participant) and a traffic accident (1 case). For the 
remaining 9 cases limited information is available. The study is still blinded, and it is unclear how many 
cases are after vaccination. 
The number of spontaneous abortion cases from VAT000008 stage 2 is considered compatible with 
background incidence. Also, some of the reported abortion cases had underlying causes or confounding 
factors reported. Based on the available data, no safety concern is identified in pregnant women 
population according to the applicant. 
The applicant has three studies that will evaluate safety in pregnant participants and infants (VAT0006, 
VAT0007 and VAT00012).

Elderly Population  
In VAT00002 booster cohort 2, there were 88 participants in the MV (B.1.351) and 52 participants in 
the BV (B.1.351+D614) booster groups ≥ 65 years. 14 participants in the MV and four in the BV were 
≥ 75 years. The MV group also included nine participants ≥ 80 years and three participants ≥ 85 
years. There were no participants ≥ 80 years in the BV group. 
Frequencies of AEs have been presented separately for patients 18-55 years and age ≥ 56 years. In 
general, the younger age group reported a higher frequency of solicited and unsolicited events than 
the older group.  
In the pooled MV and BV Booster group the frequency of any AE (solicited and unsolicited) in age 
group 18-64 was 1034/1192 (86.7%). Corresponding frequencies in the age group 65-74 years were 
77/113 (68.1%) and in age group 75-84 years 13/18 (72.2%). 
For the monovalent booster group, elderly participants in general reported fewer AEs than younger 
participants, frequency 85.1%, 75,8% and 76.9% in the age groups 18-64, 65-74 and 75-84, 
respectively. There are some indications that elderly participants report more vascular disorders than 
younger participants (frequency 4.5% and 0.5% in age groups 65-74 and 18-64, respectively). 
Numbers are small. 
No fatal case and no increase of SAEs were observed in the vaccine groups, when compared to placebo 
groups, in any of the age groups.

Immunocompromised population  
In Study VAT00002 Cohort 2 around 1.6% of the participants were immunocompromised and in Study 
VAT00008 Stage 2, immunocompromised subjects represented 5.1% of the participants.  Use in 
immunocompromised individuals is included as missing information into the RMP. 
2.5.8.6.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No interaction studies have been performed. Concomitant administration of VidPrevtyn Beta with other 
vaccines has not been studied. 
VAT00002 – Supplemental Phase III Cohort 2 and VAT00008 stage 2 
In VAT00002 Supplemental Phase III Cohort 2 and VAT00008 stage 2 study protocols reportable 
medications are defined. Their use is collected in the CRF from the day of each initial study vaccination 
to the end of the solicited and unsolicited follow-up periods. Reportable medications include 
medications that may affect the interpretation of safety data (e.g., an antipyretic or analgesic that 
could have reduced the intensity or frequency of an adverse event) or may interfere with the 
development or measurement of the immune response (e.g., the use of immune-suppressors, 
immune-modulators, or some antibiotics that can affect certain bioassays). 
Category 1 medications include those impacting or that may have an impact on the evaluation of the 
safety (e.g., antipyretics, analgesics, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], 
anticoagulants, antithrombotic). 
In VAT00002, in the MV (B.1.351) booster group 221/705 (31.3%) took category 1 medication within 
7 days following vaccination. The corresponding number in the BV (B.1.351 + D614) group was 
193/621 (31.1%). 
In VAT00008 stage 2, the vaccinated group there were 6.4% that used reportable medications within 7 
days after any study vaccination versus 5.1% in placebo. Category 1 medication that might have an 
impact on the safety evaluation was used by 6.1% in the vaccinated group and 4.6% in placebo. 
VAT00013  
No data have been submitted. 
2.5.8.7.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
VAT00002 – Supplemental Phase III Cohort 2 
No participants in the MV (B.1.351) or BV (B.1.351 + D614) booster groups, reported an AE leading to 
study discontinuation. 
VAT00008- Stage 2 
The proportion of participants who discontinued the study due to an AE was the same between 
treatment groups respectively 5 (< 0.1%) participants in the Vaccine Group and 5 (< 0.1%) 
participants in the Placebo Group; all AEs were assessed as not related to the study intervention. In 
the Vaccine Group, the PTs of the AEs leading to discontinuation were fatal wound, chronic kidney 
disease, acute respiratory distress syndrome, angioedema, and diabetic foot.   
VAT00013  
Three participants discontinued VAT00013 and none of them was due to an AE.

2.5.8.8.  Post marketing experience 
There are no post-marketing data of the vaccine. 
2.5.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety of the VidPrevtyn Beta is mainly based on interim data from the study VAT00002 
Supplemental Phase III Cohort 2, and the safety profile in the SmPC is based on this data. Included in 
this cohort where 705 participants boosted with VidPrevtyn Beta and 621 participants boosted with the 
5 µg BV CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351 + D614) vaccine in a blinded manner.  
An investigator-led study (VAT00013) provides some supportive data where participants previously 
primed with Comirnaty received a single booster dose of VidPrevtyn Beta (80 participants) or 
VidPrevtyn (D614) booster (74 participants) or Comirnaty (80 participants) in a blinded manner. 
Participants were followed for 28 days post vaccination. 
Also included in the dataset as supportive, interim data from the study VAT00008 stage 2 which is a 
randomized placebo-controlled study investigating primary vaccination with two doses of 10 µg BV 
(B.1.351 + D614) administered 21 days apart. In the reactogenicity subset 2433 vaccinated and 2418 
placebo participants were included. In the Safety Analysis Set (SafAS) that was evaluated for 
SAE/MAAE and AESIs there were 6472 participants in the vaccine group and 6450 in placebo. The data 
analysis cut-off date was 15 March 2022, and at that timepoint safety follow up past dose two for the 
SafAS was at least 1 month for 4327 participants (66.9%) and at least 2 months for 2731 participants 
(42.2%). Participants enrolled were mostly between the age of 18 and 59 years (93.9%). 
Additionally, interim data from another ongoing cohort, VAT00002 Supplemental Phase III Cohort 1 
(n= 803) and interim data from VAT00008 stage 1 (5061 vaccinated, and 5078 in placebo group) 
investigating boosting and primary vaccination with the VidPrevtyn (D614) was also assessed. Except 
for differing antigens, this vaccine has the same composition, including adjuvant (AS03). In a data cut 
from May 2022, there were imbalances seen between vaccinated and placebo (primary vaccination) on 
PT and SOC level for adverse events reported for instance dizziness and paresthesia. The applicant 
initially identified dizziness and swelling face would have been listed as ADRs in the SmPC for the D614 
however these AR are not listed for VidPrevtyn Beta, intended to be used as a booster only. The 
applicant should in the monthly reports for Vidprevtyn Beta perform close monitoring on dizziness, 
paraesthesia, swelling face/angioedema. 
As per Scientific advice on 13 July 2022 (EMA/SA/0000096498), it was understood that the dataset 
from VAT00002 and VAT00013 included 1406 participants, having received at least one dose of a beta-
containing booster formulation, including 270 individuals aged 60 years and above, with a mean safety 
follow-up over 4 months. In addition, around 13000 participants would have received either 2 doses of 
a beta containing formulation (5 µg B.1.351 + 5 µg D614 + AS03) or placebo in study VAT00008 stage 
2, which is ongoing and still blinded. This study investigates primary vaccination but was nevertheless 
considered relevant to support conclusions on the safety of VidPrevtyn Beta. It was also considered 
that the dataset generated with the parental vaccine (D614) is supportive and should be included in 
the dossier for the booster vaccine, especially considering the presence of an adjuvant in the 
formulation. Overall, the safety database was considered sufficient for the purpose of the booster 
vaccine authorisation provided no concerns was identified during data assessment. 
However, it should be mentioned that from the dataset received from VAT0008 only 2731 vaccinated 
have been followed up in line with EMA´s recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines (a follow up time 
>6 weeks post-dose two). VAT0008 stage 2 is still blinded.

Main study (basis for the safety profile in the SmPC) 
The main study, VAT00002 Supplemental Cohort 2 included 705 participants boosted with VidPrevtyn 
Beta and 621 boosted with the 5 µg BV (B.1.351+D614) vaccines.  Both booster groups (MV, BV) were 
primed with either two doses of the Comirnaty (378, 375), Spikevax (111, 108), Vaxzevria (100, 100), 
Jcovden (38, 38) or CoV2preSdTM-AS03 (D614) vaccines (78, 0) for MV and BV booster groups, 
respectively. Participants were boosted with MV or BV vaccine 4 to 10 months after receiving primary 
vaccination. Primary vaccination with the CoV2preSdTM-AS03 (D614) vaccine is not approved. 
Accordingly, participants receiving heterologous prime/boosting, are the most relevant population (627 
and 621 participants in the MV and BV group, respectively). 
The mean age (SD) of participants was 46.0 (± 15.8) and 43.7 (± 14.3) years for participants boosted 
with MV and BV vaccine, respectively. Correspondingly, 88 and 52 participants boosted with MV and BV 
vaccine respectively, were ≥65 years old. 38 out of the 88 participants ≥65 years old receiving MV 
booster, were in the protein primed group. Accordingly, only 50 participants ≥65 years in the MV group 
received heterologous prime/boosting. Overall, there were 14 and 4 participants aged > 75 years in 
the MV and BV booster groups, respectively. 
About 60% of the participants had at least one high-risk medical condition (58.9% and 58.6% in the 
MV and BV booster groups, respectively). 
Solicited local and systemic reactions were recorded for 7 days, and unsolicited adverse events were 
reported up to 21 days after booster immunization. AESI, MAAE and SAE were collected throughout the 
study. The mean participant duration in days (SD) was 144 (30.9) for participants receiving MV 
(B.1.351) or BV (B.1.351 + D614) booster dose. 
Within 7 days after a booster injection of MV (B.1.351) or BV (D614 + B.1.351) vaccines, 83.0% and 
85.1% of participants, respectively, experienced at least one solicited reaction, of which 8.7% and 
7.0%, respectively, were of Grade 3 intensity. 77.1% and 78.4% of participants, respectively, 
experienced at least one solicited injection site reaction. Injection site pain was the most frequently 
reported injection site reaction for both vaccine groups. 60.0% and 64.8.% of participants, 
respectively, experienced at least one solicited systemic reaction, of which 6.9% and 6.3% were of 
Grade 3 intensity. The most frequently reported solicited systemic reactions in the MV and BV vaccines 
group were headache (41.4% and 43.0%), myalgia (37.8% and 41.9%), and malaise (33.0% and 
33.1%).  
Within 21 days after the booster injection of MV (B.1.351) or BV (D614 + B.1.351) vaccines, the 
overall proportion of participants who experienced at least one unsolicited adverse event was 23.1% 
and 24.8 %, respectively, with grade 3 unsolicited adverse events being 2.4% and 3.1%, respectively. 
The most frequently reported unsolicited adverse events for the MV and BV booster groups were cough 
(4.4% and 5.3), fatigue (4.1% and 3.7%), rhinorrhoea (3.7% and 3.5%), and headache (3.4% for 
both groups).  The most frequently reported unsolicited adverse reaction for the MV and BV vaccine 
groups was fatigue (2.0% and 1.4%). Thereafter followed for the MV vaccine nausea (1.3%), injection 
site pruritus (0.7%) and lymphadenopathy (0.6%) and for the BV vaccine injection site pruritus 
(1.0%), nausea (0.8%) and lymphadenopathy (0.8%). 
There were no serious adverse events in the MV group considered related to the study vaccine by the 
investigator. In the BV group there was an event of serum sickness-like reaction that was considered 
related to study treatment by the study investigator. No participants in the MV or BV booster groups, 
reported an AE leading to study discontinuation.  
The list of AESI used in the clinical study diverged significantly from the list of AESIs that will be used 
post-marketing. When using the AESI list from the RMP version 0.2 for VAT0002; 27 participants 
Assessment report  
EMA/893684/2022  
Page 164/185 
 
 
 
reported AESIs for the MV booster (1 atrial fibrillation, 19 covid-19 disease-related, 1 cataract, 1 eye 
irritation, 1 eye pruritus, 1 lacrimation increased, and 1 cerebrovascular accident). 29 AESIs were 
reported from participants for the BV booster (1 anaphylactic reaction, 1 seasonal allergy, 22 AE covid 
19 infection related, 2 chilblains, 1 diabetes mellitus, 1 visual impairment and 1 cerebrovascular 
accident). One AE of chilblains was evaluated as related. 
Based on this, it can be concluded that the safety profile of the MV and BV vaccine seems to be largely 
consistent.  
Supportive data following booster vaccination with VidPrevtyn Beta 
In VAT00013 a small population (n=80) were vaccinated with VidPrevtyn Beta, MV D614 (n=74) or 
Comirnaty (N=80) as a first booster; with a follow-up of 28 days. The AE frequencies seen for 
VidPrevtyn Beta are comparable to what is seen in VAT0002. For Solicited AE Injection site pain was 
most frequently reported (77.5%) which is similar for MV (B.1.351) booster in VAT0002 (76.2%). 
“Asthenia or malaise” was the most frequently reported solicited systemic adverse reactions (40%) 
followed by “headache” (33.8%), myalgia (23.8%) and chills (12.5%) after booster vaccination with 
MV (B.1.351). For local solicited AEs the frequencies seen overall was similar between VidPrevtyn Beta 
(88.8%), MV D614 (90.6%) and Comirnaty (92.7%) while for systemic AEs VidPrevtyn Beta (62.5%) 
and Comirnaty (64.6%) had a higher reactogenicity than MV D614 (49.4%). The majority of the 
solicited adverse events was of mild intensity. In the VidPrevtyn Beta group 36.3% of the participants 
reported at least 1 unsolicited AE compared to 30.6% of the participants in the MV D614 booster 
cohort. 
In VAT000013 there was one SAEs reported for VidPrevtyn Beta; one “flare-up of polyarthritis” (AESI) 
with a relevant time to onset of 5 days evaluated by investigator to be related. The patient had had the 
same reaction after first and second dose of Comirnaty which makes this a positive rechallenge case 
with respect to COVID-19 vaccines. The applicant has confirmed that flare up of autoimmune disease 
(included polyarthritis) will be followed in PSURs post-marketing. When using the AESI list that will be 
used post marketing there was one additional AESI; 1 report of “mild eye pain”, assessed as not 
related by the investigator. 
No fatal cases were reported. 
It is not possible to evaluate the use in special populations as this information has not been presented 
in the provided documentation and the sample size is small (n=80). 
Supportive data following primary vaccination with 10 µg BV (B.1.351 + D614) 
Study VAT0008 stage 2 primary vaccination with 10 µg BV (B.1.351 + D614) includes in the 
reactogenicity subset 2433 vaccinated and 2418 placebo participants. For solicited adverse events pain 
was the most frequently reported injection site reaction 7 days after either injection in the vaccine 
group (46.2%) and placebo group (26.6%). Headache was the most frequently reported solicited 
systemic reaction after any injection in the vaccine group (32.9%) and placebo group (26.4%) followed 
by malaise (27.5 % in the vaccine group and 21.0% in the placebo group), myalgia (25% in the 
vaccine group and 17.7% in the placebo group) and arthralgia (23 % in the vaccine group and 16.4% 
in the placebo group). For solicited adverse events the data from VAT0008 stage 2 is similar to the 
data from VAT0013 and VAT0002 for (B.1.351) booster formulations.  
Within 21 days after any injection, the proportion of participants in VAT0008 stage 2 who reported at 
least 1 unsolicited AE was 6.3% for the vaccine group and 8.1% for the placebo group. This is 
significantly fewer than in VAT0002 were the overall proportion of participants who experienced at 
Assessment report  
EMA/893684/2022  
Page 165/185 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
least one unsolicited AE was 23.1% (MV CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) and 24.8% (BV CoV2 preS 
dTM-AS03 (D614 + B.1.351).   
The overall frequency of participants with any AE in the reactogenicity subset in VAT0008 stage 2 for 
the primary BV (D614 + B.1.351) vaccine is 59.5%, compared to 26.0% in the Safety Analysis Set 
population. Reporting frequency overall of 59.5% is much lower than what was reported from the 
participants from VAT0002 in the pooled safety series (84.9%) for the MV (B.1.351) booster. 
When comparing the unsolicited AE frequencies from VAT0008 stage 2 BV (D614 + B.1.135) primary 
vaccination and frequencies from the MV booster (B.1.135) in VAT0002 supplemental phase III cohort 
2, it is observed that the frequencies where much lower in the primary vaccination scheme in 
VAT00008. This is in line with what was also seen for MV D164 vaccine that was evaluated in VAT0008 
stage one. 
The reporting frequencies of AE varied for different races in VAT0008 for vaccinated and placebo 
recipients respectively; Asian participants (0.8% and 2%), Black or African American participants 
(8.8% and 10.7%), American Indian or Alaska Native participants (5.9% and 16.7%) and White 
participants (50% and 35.7%). 
The same tendency is seen for VAT0008 stage 2 that the AE frequency in the white population is much 
higher than for the other races as seen for VAT00008 stage 1. However, only a small number of white 
participants was included in VAT0008 stage 1 and 2.   
There were 11 participants (0.2%) in the Vaccine Group and 7 (0.1%) in the Placebo Group that 
reported a related MAAE. 
When using the AESI list that will be used post marketing for VAT00008 stage 2, 103 participants 
report an AESI. The AESIs reported are: (1 acute respiratory distress, 80 covid-19 cases, 13 
conjunctivitis, 4 arthritis, 2 conjunctivitis allergic, 2 seizure, 1 eye pain, 1 Lacrimation increased, 1 
vision blurred) while for placebo 99 participants reported an AESI (1 Hepatic failure, 1 anaphylactic 
reaction, 93 covid-19 cases, 2 arthritis, 5 conjunctivitis, 3 conjunctivitis allergic, 1 eye pain, 2 
Lacrimation increased, 1 eye pruritus, 1 hordeolum, 1 diabetes mellitus, 1 Azotaemia). One case of 
vision blurred, and 19 cases of suspected COVID-19 was listed as related. Four participants in the 
vaccine group died during the study. All were evaluated to be unrelated. 
In total there were 85 SAEs, 44 were in the vaccine group and 41 in placebo. None was related to 
study intervention. The data is still blinded. Since the study is still blinded it precludes the assessment 
leading to uncertainty in the data, as information regarding description of SAE after vaccination is 
currently unknown for participants in VAT0008 stage 2. The question is not closed but as the study is 
supportive this was further pursued. 
Pericarditis/myocarditis and cardiac adverse events in the clinical studies 
There are no reported events of pericarditis or myocarditis in the studies evaluated. However, some 
adverse events in the SOC Cardiac Disorders were reported in all studies that should be noted: 
In the pooled MV (B.1.351) and BV (D614+B.1.351) booster group from VAT00002. There were in the 
SOC cardiac disorders registered 10 AE (4 angina pectoris, 1 atrial fibrillation, 2 palpitations and 3 
tachycardia). One case of palpitation was evaluated as related to the study-vaccine. There were in 
addition 2 cases of chest discomfort, 2 cases of chest pain where one was related (MV B.1.351) and 4 
cases of “non-cardiac chest pain” where one was related (MV B.1.351). 
For the BV (D614+B.1.351) primary vaccination group from VAT0008 stage 2, there were in the SOC 
cardiac disorders reported one case of Rheumatic heart disease registered in the vaccine group and 1 
angina pectoris in the placebo group. There were also one related case of hypertension in the vaccine- 
Assessment report  
EMA/893684/2022  
Page 166/185 
 
 
 
and 1 related case of hypertension in the Placebo-group. There were in addition 4 cases of “non-
cardiac chest pain” in the vaccine group versus 2 in the placebo-group where none was evaluated to be 
related.  
Pericarditis and myocarditis are included in the list of AESI that will be monitored post-marketing 
(PASS VAT0007) and should also be included in the RMP as an important potential risk. The Applicant 
agrees to add “Myocarditis/ Pericarditis” as an important potential risk in the safety specification in the 
RMP. 
Safety in special patient populations 
Based on data from the main study (VAT00002 Supplemental Cohort 2) the frequency of participants 
in VidPrevtyn Beta group reporting at least one solicited adverse event was higher for participants not 
reporting a high-risk medical condition than for participants reporting such conditions (89.8% and 
78.2%, respectively). This was also observed for non-serious unsolicited adverse events (28.3% and 
19.5%, respectively). However, the frequency of participants reporting at least one serious AE and/or 
MAAE was similar for participants reporting at least one high-risk medical condition and for participants 
without such conditions (serious AE: 1.2% and 1.0%, MAAEs: 13.7% and 11.0%, respectively). Similar 
figures were seen for the BV booster group. 
Pregnant and lactating women 
Pregnant and lactating women were excluded from the study participations. However, there were 49 
pregnancies following primary vaccination reported in the supportive study VAT00008 stage 2. The 
applicant provided updated information on outcomes so far during the assessment. Three of the 49 
cases reported normal delivery, there was 1 ectopic pregnancy and 13 has reported spontaneous 
abortion. As the data is still blinded it is not clear how many of the 13 abnormal pregnancy 
terminations are after vaccination. Four of the 13 abnormal pregnancy terminations included cases 
where the participant had taken herbal concoction (2 cases), cannabis abuse/HIV (1 participant) and a 
traffic accident (1 case). For the remaining 9 cases limited information is available and as long as the 
study is blinded it hampers the assessment. Three of the cases had an TTO for the event within 28 
days after last vaccination. At the data cut of 15 March 2022 there was 4 SAE registered under the 
SOC Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions in the vaccinated group and 4 SAE in the Placebo 
group. Pregnancy will be followed in summary safety reports. 
The applicant has proposed three studies that will further evaluate safety in pregnant women and 
infants post marketing that is listed in the RMP (VAT0006, VAT0007 and VAT00012). 
Uncertainties in the safety evaluation 
The safety database for the MV booster is limited to 705 participants. Since the safety database is less 
than 3000 individuals, uncommon adverse reactions (≥1/1,000 to < 1/100) may not be detected and 
the frequencies may not be precise, which is of concern. This is reflected in the SmPC. The supportive 
data presented is mainly based on primary vaccination and not booster vaccination which is the current 
indication to be evaluated. To increase the knowledge on less common adverse events of VidPrevtyn 
Beta, the safety database needs to be expanded. 
The applicant will expand the safety database with a category 3 PASS study (VAT0008 crossover and 
booster phase). The Applicant’s assumption is that the safety database of VidPrevtyn Beta could reach 
3000 individuals by April 2023.  
The Applicant will submit monthly reports to EMA with information on the number of participants 
having received the booster dose and AE/ARs reported. The monthly reports should also include “heavy 
menstrual bleeding” for increased monitoring as the PT has newly been identified as an adverse 
reaction after Spikevax and Comirnaty vaccination. 
Assessment report  
EMA/893684/2022  
Page 167/185 
 
 
 
Further data will be obtained from the booster phase of the VAT00008 study (Category 3 study in the 
RMP). In this Phase III study having enrolled 23727 participants, all participants are offered a 
VidPrevtyn Beta booster dose and followed for 12 months after receipt of booster. Monthly updates 
from VAT00008 extension study will be sent. Whenever the safety database of VidPrevtyn Beta will 
reach 2000 and 3000 participants, the safety section of the SmPC will be reviewed to consider if an 
update is needed.  
When the safety database reaches 2000 and 3000 participants with at least 6 weeks safety follow up 
time, the Applicant commits to review the SmPC and assess whether any updates are required.  
There are few elderly, pregnant, lactating, individuals with autoimmune diseases and 
immunocompromised included in the studies. Follow-up time is short, and long term safety is not 
known.  
There is no safety data on use of the vaccine as a second, third and fourth booster, and it is reflected 
in 4.8 in the SmPC that the data is from use as a first booster. 
No interaction studies have been performed with other vaccines. 
2.5.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
After review of the interim safety data from VAT0002, the main study to support safety of the booster 
vaccine, the reactogenicity profile of the MV (B.1.351) booster vaccine is considered acceptable. The 
most frequent ADRs are injection site pain (76.2%), headache (41.4%), myalgia (37.8%), malaise 
(33.0%), arthralgia (28.7%), and chills (19.9%). Due to the size of the safety database for VidPrevtyn 
Beta (n=705), uncommon adverse reactions may not be detected. Data with the use of bivalent 
booster from VAT0002 (D614+B.1.351) and bivalent primary vaccination from VAT0008 
(D614+B.1.351) expand the safety database and give support to the safety profile. However, there are 
limitations in these data related to differences in antigens (BV versus MV) for both studies and the use 
as primary series in VAT0008.                                
The safety database for the MV (B.1.351) booster is currently being expanded in the VAT00008 
crossover and booster Phase. These data should be provided once available. When the safety database 
reaches 2000 and 3000 participants, the Applicant plans to review the SmPC. The Applicant will submit 
monthly reports to EMA. 
Long-term safety data are not available but is proposed to be monitored in several post marketing

2.8.  Product information 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.8.2.  Labelling exemptions 
The following exemptions from labelling requirements have been granted on the basis of article 63(3) 
of Directive 2001/83/EC. In addition, the derogations granted should be seen in the context of the 
flexibilities described in the Questions and Answers on labelling flexibilities for COVID-19 vaccines 
(EMA/726359/2022 rev.4, from 13 September 2022)1 which aim at facilitating the preparedness work 
of COVID-19 vaccine developers and the associated logistics of early printing packaging activities. The 
ultimate goal is to facilitate the large scale and rapid deployment of COVID-19 vaccines for EU citizens 
within the existing legal framework. 
Labelling flexibilities 
The temporary labelling flexibilities granted to VidPrevtyn Beta are as follows: 
• 
Packaging (i.e. outer carton + intermediate pack + vial label) in English only 
•  Use of one Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) within the unique identifier 
•  Omission of blue box information* 
•  No package leaflet included in the outer carton* (but printed package leaflets provided 
separately by the MAH, who will be responsible for the distribution of the printed package 
leaflet locally) 
• 
Temporary exemption from the obligation to provide the printed package leaflet in national 
language(s). Except for the countries listed below, package leaflets distributed alongside 
the supplies of the vaccine can be printed in English only. 
The following Member States still require the printed package leaflet in their national 
language(s): Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Germany and Portugal. 
• 
The number of printed package leaflets does not correspond to the number of doses. 
•  Release of packs printed at risk with the EU marketing authorisation number 
EU/1/21/1580/003 instead of EU/1/21/1580/001 (until the end of December 2022). 
•  Supply of adjuvant vial labels and adjuvant intermediate cartons printed with “Vidprevtyn” 
(instead of “VidPrevtyn Beta”) due to at-risk printing activities (until May 2023). 
•  Supply of packs displaying “VidPrevtyn Beta 5 micrograms” (outer carton and antigen 
intermediate pack) or “VidPrevtyn Beta 5 mcg” (antigen vial label), instead of “VidPrevtyn 
Beta” only due to at-risk printing activities (until May 2023).

Unless otherwise specified above, these labelling flexibilities are granted until the end of April 2023. 
The labelling subject to translation exemption as per the QRD Group decision above will however be 
translated in all languages in the Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website, but the printed 
materials will only be translated in the language(s) as agreed by the QRD Group. 
2.8.3.  Quick Response (QR) code 
A request to include a QR code in the labelling (i.e. outer carton and antigen intermediate carton) and 
package leaflet for the purpose of providing statutory and additional information to healthcare 
professionals and vaccine recipients has been submitted by the applicant and has been found 
acceptable. 
The following elements have been agreed to be provided through a QR code: 
• 
• 
Statutory information: SmPC, package leaflet, vaccination card, blue box information, contact 
information for adverse event reporting, contact information for local representative. 
Additional information: video with instructions for mixing of the two components of the vaccine. 
2.8.4.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, VidPrevtyn Beta SARS-CoV-2 prefusion 
Spike delta TM protein, recombinant (B.1.351 strain) is included in the additional monitoring list as it 
contains a new active substance and it is a biological medicine.  
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
COVID-19 is a disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The clinical manifestation of 
COVID-19 is non-specific and variable. It can range from no symptoms (asymptomatic) to severe 
pneumonia and death. The disease burden is highest amongst subjects with increased age; however, 
all age groups are susceptible. Underlying health conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, 
cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, chronic kidney disease, immune compromised 
status, cancer and obesity are considered risk factors for developing severe COVID-19. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
At the time of authorisation of this vaccine, several products have received marketing authorisation for 
the treatment of COVID-19. These encompass antiviral therapy (PF-07321332/ritonavir, remdesivir), 
anti-inflammatory therapy (dexamethasone), IL-6 inhibitor (tocilizumab), IL-1 inhibitor (anakinra) as 
well as monoclonal antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (casirivimab/imdevimab, 
Assessment report  
EMA/893684/2022  
Page 178/185 
 
 
 
regdanvimab and sotrovimab). In addition, a combination of two monoclonal antibodies (tixagevimab / 
cilgavimab) was authorised based on its ability to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection. These 
therapies may show variable efficacy depending on the severity and duration of illness as well as 
against different variants of concern. 
There are 4 approved vaccines for active immunisation against SARS-CoV-2 aiming to prevent COVID-
19 disease to be used for primary immunisation and booster: Comirnaty (EMEA/H/C/005735), 
Spikevax (EMEA/H/C/005791), Jcovden (EMEA/H/C/005737) and Nuvaxovid (EMEA/H/C/005808). 
Other 2 vaccines are also approved for primary immunisation: Vaxzevria (EMEA/H/C/005675) and 
COVID-19 Vaccine (inactivated, adjuvanted) Valneva (EMEA/H/C/006019/0000). The mRNA vaccines 
include in their marketing authorisation adapted Omicron vaccines. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The post-hoc analysis in VAT00013 met the primary endpoint. The neutralising Ab geometric mean 
titre ratio (GMTR) against Omicron BA.1 variant strain of VidPrevtyn Beta relative to Comirnaty was 
2.53 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.80; 3.57) meeting the superiority criterion. 
The descriptive analysis of GMTs and GMTRs in VAT00002 indicates that VidPrevtyn Beta strongly 
restores immunity in previously COVID-19 primed individuals.  
For the first co-primary objective, the neutralising Ab geometric mean titre ratio (GMTR) of MV CoV2 
preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) vaccine booster dose in Pfizer/BioNTech primed participants aged 18-55 
years at D15 to the 2-dose primary series in the Comparator Group at D36 was 1.96 (98.3% 
confidence interval [CI]: 1.54; 2.50). For the second co-primary objective, the geometric mean of 
individual ratio of post-booster neutralising Ab GMTs at D15 relative to pre-booster neutralising Ab 
GMTs in Pfizer/BioNTech primed participants aged 18-55 years at D01 was 35.41 (98.3% CI: 26.71; 
46.95), which meets the superiority criterion of lower limit of the 2-sided 98.3% CI of GMTR > 2. 
A notable increase of nABs after a booster dose of the VidPrevtyn Beta against the D614 and the 
B.1.351 strain irrespective of priming vaccine/priming platform in both adult age cohorts (18-55 and 
≥56 years of age) and in individuals with high-risk conditions is observed. Moreover, VidPrevtyn Beta 
induced a notable increase in neutralising antibody titres to all Omicron subvariants in younger and 
older adults primed with Comirnaty on D15, when compared to pre-boost levels. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
No correlate of protection against COVID-19 exists. Neutralising activity of SARS-CoV-2 by 
hyperimmune sera is used as a surrogate in vitro marker to infer a protective effect, as this is thought 
to most closely reflect the in vivo scenario of antibody-mediated protection. However, no threshold for 
a protective effect has been established. The comparative approach of VidPrevtyn Beta to Comirnaty 
with known efficacy is therefore essential for the interpretation of a potential protective effect of 
VidPrevtyn Beta. 
The descriptive analysis of the nAB titres in VAT00002 indicates that VidPrevtyn Beta notably restores 
the immune response after priming with different COVID-19 vaccines. The sample size of participants 
over 65 years of age is limited to 140 who were boosted with VidPrevtyn Beta or the BV 
(D614+B.1.351) vaccine. 
Assessment report  
EMA/893684/2022  
Page 179/185 
 
 
 
A direct comparison of the induced booster immune response of the MV (B.1.351) vaccine against the 
evaluated SARS-CoV-2 strains in the different groups and age cohorts is impeded by varying baseline 
antibody titres against the strains in each intervention group, each age cohort and the comparator 
group. The different baseline titres most probably reflect the SARS-CoV-2 naïve serostatus in the 
comparator group and to an unknown extent the immune response to primary vaccination as well as 
natural infection before booster in the intervention booster groups.  
The assessment of nAB immune response after a booster dose of VidPrevtyn Beta against the Omicron 
subvariants BA.1, BA.2, and BA.4 was performed in different laboratories in a small subset of 
participants, i.e. 10 subjects ≥56 years of age and 20 subjects 18-55 years. No immunogenicity data 
estimating the nAB immune response against Omicron subvariants are available for priming COVID-19 
vaccines from Comirnaty. 
The main trials VAT00013 and VAT00002 Phase III showed several methodological limitations, most 
notably the lack of pre-specified hypotheses and the small sample size. Nevertheless, these aspects 
are not considered to have critically impacted the integrity of the results. 
The immunogenicity/efficacy in the immunocompromised individuals might be different from those 
observed in the overall population therefore the Applicant should provide immunogenicity and safety 
data on this population from the two planned studies (VAT00027 and VAT00028) as soon as results are 
available.   
The Beta variant to which VidPrevtyn Beta is directed against is no longer prevalent, but preliminary 
studies with a number of assays including non-validated assays show cross reactivity to Omicron 
variants. For data based on non-validated assays, the results are uncertain and should be interpreted 
with caution.  
There is no efficacy data for VidPrevtyn Beta. The level of protection and duration of protection 
afforded following vaccination with MV (B.1.351) is therefore uncertain.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety of VidPrevtyn Beta is mainly characterised by local and systemic reactions and the most 
common adverse reactions were injection site pain (76.2%), headache (41.4%), myalgia (37.8%), 
malaise (33.0%), arthralgia (28.7%), and chills (19.9%). Most adverse reactions occurred within 3 
days following vaccination and were mild to moderate in severity. Overall, the median duration of local 
and systemic adverse reactions was 1 to 3 days. Higher frequencies of reactions were reported in 
participants aged 18-55 years compared to older participants.  
There were no serious adverse events in the VidPrevtyn Beta considered related to the study vaccine.  
The extended safety database set (n=3795) consists of the VAT00002 Cohort 2 booster groups (MV 
and BV) and the reactogenicity subset of VAT00008 (BV Primary vaccination). Most of the adverse 
events proposed to be listed in the SmPC, have the same frequency category in VidPrevtyn Beta safety 
database (n=705) and in the extended safety database. 
No fatal cases were reported. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Long term safety data is not available at this stage. It is important to analyse the full safety follow-up 
of the ongoing trials. 86,5% of the participants in VAT00002 had a safety follow up of ≥2 months, 
which is considered acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/893684/2022  
Page 180/185 
 
 
 
Pooling of data from booster and primary vaccination introduces uncertainty in the frequency 
estimates. Frequencies of adverse reactions in the SmPC is calculated based on the MV (B.1.351) 
safety set. The sample size of 705 participants is too small to detect most uncommon adverse events. 
The safety database needs to be expanded. Further data post-authorisation is awaited. 
Not all details requested could be provided as the data are still blinded.   
Available data (non-clinical, clinical) do not raise a concern regarding vaccine-associated enhanced 
disease. The possibility of enhanced disease cannot be excluded with certainty. The current version of 
the RMP lists vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease as an important potential risk in the 
summary of safety concerns. 
There are no data on use in breast- feeding women. There are few elderly and participants with 
autoimmune disease included in the studies. 
Narcolepsy has not been reported in the context of this application. Nevertheless, due to the vaccine’s 
composition using AS03 as adjuvant, narcolepsy is recommended to be closely monitored post-
authorisation.  
Adverse events of myocarditis/pericarditis have been reported following vaccination with mRNA 
vaccines, with increased rates in younger and especially male vaccine recipients. No such events have 
been reported during the VidPrevtyn Beta studies. However, the trials are not large enough to detect 
such potential adverse events. 
There is no safety data on use of the vaccine as a second, third and fourth booster. 
Interaction with other vaccines. There are no data available of concomitant administration of 
VidPrevtyn Beta with other vaccines.

3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The immunogenicity data submitted indicate that VidPrevtyn Beta restores the immune response in 
adults who have previously received an mRNA or adenoviral vector COVID-19 vaccine.  
Regardless of the immunogenicity endpoint evaluated including neutralising Ab responses against a 
panel of variants (D614G, Delta, Beta, and Omicron BA.1), the immune response elicited by VidPrevtyn 
Beta was higher than that elicited by Comirnaty booster vaccine. Moreover, the descriptive analysis of 
nABs shows a notable increase of GMTs on day 15 after booster vaccination with VidPrevtyn Beta. This 
is irrespective of the priming vaccine/priming platform and the age cohort. An increase was also 
observed in individuals with high-risk medical conditions. 
However, the pivotal trial VAT00013 was not designed as a pivotal study. Post-hoc analyses were 
determined retrospectively to allow comparison of the superiority of an approved mRNA vaccine 
against Omicron BA.1 for the scope of this application. The most important limitation was that the 
primary analysis of neutralising antibodies was performed with a non-validated assay. The retesting of 
VAT00013 samples with the validated monogram assay from study VAT00002 resolved this issue.

The observed safety profile of VidPrevtyn Beta did not reveal any major safety concerns. However, 
there are certain limitations in the dataset due to the small size of the safety database (N=705). Data 
with the use of bivalent booster from VAT0002 (D614+B.1.351) and bivalent primary vaccination from 
VAT0008 (D614+B.1.351) expand the safety database and give some support to the safety profile. 
Furthermore, there are limitations in these data related to differences in antigens for both studies and 
the use as primary series in VAT0008.   
The observed adverse reactions (solicited and unsolicited, short term) are acceptable based on 
severity, duration and reversibility and considered typical for a non-live, adjuvanted vaccine. No safety 
issues were detected in participants with high risk medical conditions. The database is limited for 
pregnant and breast-feeding women, for elderly, in the immunocompromised individuals and 
individuals with autoimmune diseases.  There is no safety data on use of the vaccine as a second, third 
and fourth booster. No interaction studies have been performed with other vaccines. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The vaccine has been developed using an immunobridging approach using neutralising antibodies 
against the S-protein to infer efficacy from an already authorised COVID-19 vaccine with proven 
efficacy. The benefit/risk balance of VidPrevtyn Beta for the sought indication “VidPrevtyn Beta as a 
booster for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 in adults who have previously received an mRNA 
or adenoviral vector COVID-19 vaccine (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). The use of this vaccine should be in 
accordance with official recommendations” is positive.  
No safety concerns have been identified based on available information, although due to the limited 
size of the safety database (n=705) only common adverse events is likely to be identified. The 
experience is limited for the elderly population as well as in pregnant, breast-feeding women and for 
immunocompromised. Long-term safety data is not available. 
Furthermore, in view of the development programme, the nature of the product and the data package 
provided, the dossier is considered comprehensive vis-à-vis the dossier requirements for a vaccine 
authorisation using an immuno-bridging approach. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Vidprevtyn Beta is positive, subject to the conditions stated in 
section ‘Recommendations’. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Vidprevtyn Beta is favourable in the following indication(s): 
“VidPrevtyn Beta is indicated as a booster for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 in adults who 
have previously received an mRNA or adenoviral vector COVID-19 vaccine (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). 
The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations.” 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Assessment report

Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
•  Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and 
interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and 
any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that SARS-CoV-2 prefusion Spike 
delta TM protein, recombinant (B.1.351 strain) is to be qualified as a new active substance in itself as 
it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
Refer to Appendix on new active substance (NAS).

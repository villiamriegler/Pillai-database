SmPC, Annex 
Based upon the data that have become available since the 
II, Labelling 
granting of the initial Marketing Authorisation, the CHMP 
and PL 
considers that the benefit-risk balance of Adrovance 
remains positive, but considers that its safety profile is to 
be closely monitored for the following reasons: 
There are a number of ongoing safety issues for 
alendronate for which post-marketing studies are ongoing 
or planned, the results of which are expected to yield 
important new safety data which could impact on the 
benefit-risk balance of the product. These studies pertain to 
oesophageal adverse effects and atypical femoral fractures 
Therefore, based upon the safety profile of Adrovance, 
which requires the submission of 3-yearly PSURs, the CHMP 
concluded that the MAH should submit one additional 
renewal application in 5 years time.

cumulative review by the MAH of spontaneous reports 
describing osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), to add 
"smoking" as a risk factor for ONJ in section 4.4 of the SPC. 
The application was submitted as a Type II variation

As the information about ONJ in the Product Information

did not fully reflect the key messages regarding the risk 
minimisation measures for ONJ as identified in the Article 
5(3) Referral on bisphosphonates and ONJ, additional 
wording fully reflecting those key messages were 
implemented in SPC section 4.4.  The description of ONJ in 
SPC section 4.8 was shortened. The PL was amended 
accordingly, informing patients about the symptoms of ONJ 
and what action to take; advising on the need for patients 
to maintain good oral hygiene, to receive routine dental 
check ups and to report any oral symptoms such as dental 
mobility, pain or swelling; advising on the possible need for 
patients to have a dental check- up before starting 
treatment with the medicinal product. 
In addition, the PL section 2 was reformatted for 
FOSAVANCE/ADROVANCE/VANTAVO to make it consistent 
with FOSAMAX; the details of the Dutch local 
representative in Section 6 were amended; the 
ADROVANCE and VANTAVO annexes were harmonised with 
the annexes of Fosavance as agreed during the Fosavance 
Renewal (QRD changes).

of alendronate and oesophageal carcinoma, the CHMP 
concluded that Barrett's oesophagus is a potentially 
premalignant condition of the oesophagus and a significant 
marker for the development of oesophageal cancer.  
Although the data are currently inconclusive and further 
investigation is required, the possibility that alendronate 
use may be associated with an increased risk of 
oesophageal cancer can not be excluded.  
Therefore Barrett's oesophagus was included as a warning 
in section 4.4 of the SPC.

may affect ability to drive. Furthermore, section  4.5 was 
updated to include that  caution should be used during 
concomitant use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs) with alendronate due to an increased risk of 
serious upper GI complications in patients taking NSAIDs 
and alendronate concomitantly, and in section  4.8

Holder has received a total of 1720 spontaneous adverse 
reaction reports of alopecia in association with alendronate. 
A total of 224 reports had evidence of recovery/recovering 
upon discontinuation of alendronate therapy, including 23 
reports in which patients restarted alendronate therapy and 
the condition recurred. The reported adverse events were 
generally characterised by diffuse loss of scalp hair 1-2 
months after initiation of alendronate therapy. As an 
improvement or full recovery upon discontinuation of 
alendronate therapy was observed in some of the cases, 
the CHMP considered that a causal relationship between 
alopecia and alendronate therapy cannot be excluded and 
agreed to include the term 'alopecia' in section 4.8 of the 
SPC and accordingly in the PL.

Update of Summary of Product Characteristics 
indicated that periodontal disease is a risk factor for 
Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) associated with 
bisphosphonates. Periodontal disease was found in a subset 
of the patients in a review of spontaneous cases reported 
with alendronate. A total of 147 spontaneous reports of 
ONJ in association with alendronate sodium and 
alendronate sodium/colecalciferol were identified. In 48 of 
these reports the patients had periodontal disease and/or 
other concurrent oral conditions including gum disorders 
and ill-fitting dentures. The CHMP therefore agreed to 
update the SPC to include periodontal disease as a risk

2800 IU to 5600 IU per tablet to be taken once a

deficiency in risk patient groups including the elderly. 
The overall risk-benefit is considered to be 
favourable. Given the importance of adequate 
vitamin D status in osteoporotic patients, and the 
evidence of a high incidence of vitamin D 
insufficiency in osteoporotic patients, this treatment 
would simplify therapy and help to prevent vitamin D 
insufficiency in this group. Furthermore, the 
satisfactory safety profile of the combination tablet, 
in both baseline vitamin D sufficient and insufficient 
subjects, would make it suitable for patients without

per tablet to be taken once a week in order to further 
reduce the risk of vitamin D deficiency in risk patient 
groups including the elderly. The overall risk-benefit is 
considered to be favourable. Given the importance of 
adequate vitamin D status in osteoporotic patients, and the 
evidence of a high incidence of vitamin D insufficiency in 
osteoporotic patients, this treatment would simplify therapy 
and help to prevent vitamin D insufficiency in this group. 
Furthermore, the satisfactory safety profile of the 
combination tablet, in both baseline vitamin D sufficient 
and insufficient subjects, would make it suitable for 
patients without the need for prior assessment of vitamin D 
status.

Scientific conclusions  
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for Aclasta, the scientific conclusions of 
PRAC are as follows:  
Based  on  recent  publications  which  demonstrate  that  anti-angiogenic  medicinal  products  are 
associated  with  ONJ,  the  MAH  proposed  additions  of  “anti-angiogenic  medicinal  products”  to  the 
existing concomitant risk factors in sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the Aclasta SmPC are endorsed.  
As the up-to date cumulative MAH safety database review retrieved a total of 280 reported cases of 
Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), the PRAC recommends to amend the information in the SmPC as the 
current wording focuses mainly on cancer patients. A statement that “Osteonecrosis of the jaw has 
been reported in patients treated with zoledronic acid” is added in section 4.4. Specific information of 
ONJ in patients with cancer-indication (with different dosing regimen) that is currently repetitious in 
both 4.4 and 4.8 should be deleted in section 4.4, but can be maintained in section 4.8 (description of 
selected adverse reactions).  
The  PRAC  recommended  to  change  (placement  of)  information  on  hydration  and  calcium  intake, 
currently presented in SmPC section 4.2 under the subheading on Paget`s disease, as hydration intake 
and calcium intake are important for all patients treated with Aclasta. 
Therefore,  and  in  view  of  available  data  regarding  ONJ,  the  PRAC  considered  that  changes  to  the 
product information were warranted for zoledronic acid 5mg (Aclasta indications) 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Aclasta, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance ZOLEDRONIC ACID 5mg is favourable 
subject to the proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.

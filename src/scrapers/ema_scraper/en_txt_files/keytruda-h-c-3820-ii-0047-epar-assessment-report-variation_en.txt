Extension of Indication to include (as monotherapy) adjuvant treatment of melanoma in adults with lymph 
node involvement who have undergone complete resection, based on study KEYNOTE-054; a randomized, 
double-blind, phase 3 study conducted in collaboration with the European Organisation for Research and 
Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), undertaken to evaluate adjuvant therapy with pembrolizumab compared to 
placebo in patients with resected high-risk melanoma (Stage IIIA [> 1 mm lymph node metastasis], IIIB 
and IIIC). As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated and the Package 
Leaflet has been updated accordingly. An updated RMP version 17.1 was provided as part of the application. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant  to  Article  8  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  1901/2006,  the  application  included  an  EMA  Decision(s) 
P/0043/2018 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0043/2018 was not yet completed as some measures 
were deferred.  
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related 
to the proposed indication. 
Scientific advice 
The MAH received Scientific Advice from the CHMP on 20 November 2014 (EMEA/H/SA/2437/6/2014/II). 
The Scientific advice pertained to clinical aspects of the dossier. Questions related to the design element of

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The MAH submitted a variation to the marketing authorisation to extend the indication to include (as 
monotherapy) adjuvant treatment of melanoma in adults with lymph node involvement who have 
undergone complete resection. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Melanoma  is  a  malignant  tumour  that  originates  from  melanocytic  cells  and  primarily  involves  the  skin, 
causing 90% of skin cancer mortality1. The European incidence of malignant melanoma varies from 3 to 
5/100  000/year  in  Mediterranean  countries  to  12–25  in  Nordic  countries,  and  a  disparity  in  the 
mortality-to-incidence  ratios between Western  and  Eastern  European countries has been observed2 .  Its 
incidence  continues  to  rise  worldwide.  Median  age  at  diagnosis  is  59  years.  However,  melanoma  is  not

uncommon among individuals younger than 30 years, being the second most commonly diagnosed cancer 
(after  lymphomas)  among  adolescents  and  young  adults 3 .  The  major  environmental  risk  factor  for 
melanoma is ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Increased UV light exposure of a genetically predisposed population 
seems to be, at least in part, responsible for an ongoing rise in incidence2. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
For adjuvant treatment in melanoma, surgical excision is the primary treatment for melanoma. Sentinel 
lymphnode biopsy (SNLB) in melanoma with a tumour thickness of >1 mm and >0.75 mm and additional 
risk factors such as ulceration or mitotic rate is recommended for staging2. A complete lymphadenectomy of 
regional LNs must be discussed with the patient, if the sentinel node was found positive for metastases. 
Among patients with a positive SLNB, additional positive non-sentinel lymphnodes are reported in about 
20% of the CLND specimens (NCCN V2.2018). However, this procedure offers a relapse-free survival but did 
not appear to increase melanoma specific survival2,4, 7. 
After  complete  resection,  adjuvant  therapy  is  offered  to  patients  without  evidence  of  macroscopic 
metastases but at high risk of having microscopic metastases and higher risk of relapse. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation,  diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Approximately 90% of melanomas are diagnosed as primary tumours without evidence of metastasis. The 
outcome of melanoma depends on the stage at presentation. For early-stage melanoma, surgical resection 
is the standard treatment and is associated with an excellent long-term survival prognosis for stage I (98%) 
and stage II (90%). However, patients with stage III disease, who have regional involvement at diagnosis, 
are at higher risk or recurrence after locoregional resections.  Lymph node tumour burden at the time of 
staging, ulceration, and Breslow thickness of the primary melanoma are the most predictive independent 
factors for survival in patients with stage III disease. 
Staging of melanoma as of January 2018 is now performed using the AJCC 8th edition TNM classification5; 
however, at the time of KEYNOTE-054 protocol development and initiation of subject enrollment, the AJCC 
7th edition was in effect for TNM staging.

Key changes in the 8th edition of AJCC Cancer Staging Manual include: 
Primary tumour status (T): 
 
Tumour thickness measurements to be measured to the nearest 0.1 mm, not 0.01 mm; 
  Revised definitions of T1a and T1b (T1a, <0.8 mm without ulceration; T1b, 0.8-1.0 mm with or without 
ulceration or <0.8 mm with ulceration), with mitotic rate no longer a T1 category criterion but should be 
documented for all invasive melanoma; 
Regional Lymph node status (N): 
  N category includes regional lymph node as well as non-nodal regional disease (i.e., satellites, intransit 
metastasis,  and  microsatellites),  as  non-nodal  regional  disease  was  grouped  together  for  staging 
purposes (because they each had a similar impact on prognosis).  
  Definitions of N subcategories are revised, with the presence of microsatellites, satellites, or in-transit 
metastases  now categorized as N1c, N2c,  or  N3c based on the number of tumour-involved regional 
lymph nodes, if any; 
 
The definition of a microsatellite was refined and clarified; a microsatellite is a microscopic cutaneous 
and/or  subcutaneous  metastasis  adjacent  or  deep  to,  but  discontinuous  from,  a  primary  melanoma 
detected on pathological examination of the primary tumour site. 
 
The N category descriptor ‘‘microscopic’’ and ‘‘macroscopic’’ have been replaced by ‘‘clinically occult’’ 
(i.e.,  detected  by  SLN  biopsy)  and  ‘‘clinical  evident’’  (i.e.,  detected  by  clinical  examination  or 
radiographic  imaging)  regional  disease  (corresponding  to  N  category  designations  ‘‘a’’  and  ‘‘b’’, 
respectively) 
AJCC Prognostic Stage III Groups 
  Stage III groupings have been redefined and increased from three to four subgroups, with the addition 
of  a  stage  IIID  subgroup.  Stage  III  disease  is  associated  with  heterogeneous  outcomes;  five-year 
melanoma-specific survival rates range from 93 percent for stage IIIA disease to 32 percent for stage 
IIID disease. 
Definition of Distant Metastatis (M) 
  The site of distant metastasis remains the primary component of the M category: non-visceral (distant 
cutaneous, subcutaneous, nodal), M1a; lung, M1b; non-central nervous system (CNS) visceral, M1c. 
However, a new M1d designation was added for metastases involving the CNS. M1c no longer includes 
CNS metastasis. 
  Although  an  elevated  lactate  dehydrogenase  (LDH)  is  no  longer  an  M1c  criterion,  LDH  remains  an 
important predictor of survival in stage IV and is now recorded for any M1 anatomic site of disease. 
At the time of protocol development, 5-year survival rates reported by AJCC 7th edition for patients with 
stage  IIIA,  IIIB,  and  IIIC  melanoma  were  78%,  59%,  and  40%,  respectively 6 .  The  5-year 
melanoma-specific survival rates according to the current AJCC 8th edition Staging Guidelines are 93%, 
83%, 69%, and 32% for stage IIIA, IIIB, IIIC, and IIID, respectively4.

KEYNOTE 054 enrolled subjects with stage IIIA (with lymph node metastasis >1 mm), stage IIIB, or IIIC 
melanoma. Patients with a stage IIIA lymph node metastasis >1 mm were included because they have a 
significantly higher risk of relapse and death compared to patients with <1 mm nodal metastasis7.   
In addition, subjects were required to have a complete lymph node dissection; however, the benefit of lymph 
node dissection was recently confirmed to confer only regional disease control without a benefit for OS8.   
2.1.5.  Management 
According  to  NCCN  guidelines,  high-dose  IFN-α  is  an  option  in  stage  IIB-C  melanoma.  For  completely 
resected stage III melanoma, management  options include observation or nivolumab for resected stage 
IIIb/C  (category  1)  or  dabrafenib/trametinib  for  patients  with  BRAF  V600  activating  mutation  and  SNL 
metastatis  >1  mm  (category  1)  or  high-dose  ipilimumab  for  SLN  metastasis  >1  mm  (category  1)  or 
interferon alfa (which can be given as high dose IFN-α for one year or as peg-IFN- α2b for up to 5 years. 
Among  the  above  options,  NCCN  consider  nivolumab  the  preferred  adjuvant  immunotherapy  regimen 
(NCCN V2.2018). 
According to the ESMO guidelines, patients with resected stage III are evaluated for IFN therapy: patients 
with  microscopic  regional  nodal  involvement  and/or  ulcerated  primaries  are  most  likely  to  benefit.  For 
patients  with  ≥stage  IIIB,  clinical  trials  or  high-dose  IFN-α-2b  are  options.  High-dose  IFN-α-2b  is  an 
approved indication and offered in some European countries for high risk resected stage II or III melanoma 
on the basis of reduction in RFS, although not universally because of marginal OS benefit and the significant 
toxicity. Observation is frequently used as the standard of care in Europe1,2,9. 
Ipilimumab is approved for adjuvant treatment of melanoma in the US, but not in EU as this indication was 
never submitted to EMA. Nivolumab is approved as monotherapy for the adjuvant treatment of adults with 
melanoma with involvement of lymph nodes or metastatic disease who have undergone complete resection.

The combination dabrafenib/trametinib has also been approved in the EU for the adjuvant treatment of adult 
patients with Stage III melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation, following complete resection. 
Interferon-alfa:  A  Cochrane  meta-analysis  from  2013  supported  the  therapeutic  efficacy  of  adjuvant 
interferon alpha (low, intermediate and high dosage) for the treatment of people with high-risk (AJCC TNM 
stage II-III) cutaneous melanoma in terms of  both disease-free survival and, though to a lower extent, 
overall survival, compared to observation. A total of 10,499 participants from 18 RCTs published between 
1995 and 2011 were eligible for the review. Of the 18 RCTs, the results from 17 trials and 15 trials  were 
suitable to quantify the therapeutic efficacy of interferon in terms of DFS  and OS, respectively. Adjuvant 
interferon was associated with significantly improved disease-free survival (HR = 0.83; 95% CI 0.78 to 0.87, 
P value < 0.00001) and overall survival (HR = 0.91; 95% CI 0.85 to 0.97; P value = 0.003)10. A more recent 
individual  patient  data  meta-analysis  showed  significant  event-free  survival  improvement  with  IFN-α 
(HR = 0.86, CI 0.81-0.91; P < 0.00001) and OS (HR = 0.90, CI 0.85-0.97; P = 0.003)11. 
Ipilimumab: Ipilimumab, a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that blocks CTLA-4, was investigated in 
the  adjuvant  melanoma  setting  in  the  phase  III  double  blind  clinical  trial  EORTC  18071.  Patients  with 
complete resected stage III (excluding lymph node metastasis ≤1 mm or in-transit metastasis) cutaneous 
melanoma were randomized to receive ipilimumab 10 mg/kg (475 patients) or placebo (476) every 3 weeks 
for 4 doses, then every 3 months for up to 3 years or until disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity. 
Recurrence-free survival was the primary end point. Median RFS was 26.1 months (95% CI 19·3–39·3) in 
the ipilimumab group vs 17.1 months (95% CI 13·4–21·6) in the placebo group (HR 0.75; 95% CI 0·64–
0·90; p=0·0013). An updated analysis at a median follow-up of 5.3 years showed 5-year RFS rate of 40.8% 
vs 30.3% and a 5-years OS rate of 65.4% vs 54.4% (HR for death, 0.72; 95.1% CI, 0.58 to 0.88; P=0.001). 
Grade 3-4 AEs occurred in 54.1% of the patients in the ipilimumab group, with 52% of patients discontinuing 
ipilimumab due to AR and 5 deaths due to immune-related adverse events.12,13  
The anti-PD1 antibody nivolumab has been evaluated in the adjuvant melanoma setting in    Checkmate 238 
(CA209238), a phase 3, randomized, double-blind study in subjects that had complete resection of stage 
IIIB/C  or  stage  IV  Melanoma.  Patients  were  randomized  to  nivolumab  (453 patients)  3  mg/kg  (every  2 
weeks) or ipilimumab (453 patients) 10 mg/kg  (every  3 weeks for 4 doses  followed by every 12 weeks 
starting at week 24) with a maximum  duration  of  treatment of 1 year and a total follow-up of 5 years. 
Patients were stratified by PD-L1 status (on the basis of a 5% cutoff in tumor cells) and disease stage (Stage 
IIIb/c, Stage IV M1a-M1b or Stage IV M1c). With a total of 360 events (34% in nivolumab and 45.5% in 
ipilimumab),  the  primary  analysis  in  all  randomized  subjects  with  a  minimum  follow-up  of  18  months 
demonstrates a statistically significant improvement in RFS with nivolumab compared to ipilimumab with HR 
of 0.65 (97.56% CI: 0.51,0.83; stratified log-rank p<0.001). Median RFS was not reached in either arm. 
RFS rates were higher in the nivolumab group than in the ipilimumab group at 6- (79.8% vs 72.6%), 12- 
(70.5% vs 60.8%) and 18-months (66.4% vs 52.7%), showing an absolute difference in RFS rate increasing 
over  time.  A  RFS  advantage  of  nivolumab  vs  ipilimumab  is  seen  in  PD-L1  positive  (≥  5%)  subjects 
(secondary endpoint) (HR=0.50, 95%CI 0.32, 0.78)14.

7th  edition of AJCC staging) cutaneous BRAF  V600 E/K  mutant melanoma after surgical resection (≤ 12 
weeks prior to randomization). A total of 870 patients were randomized (438 in dabrafenib+trametinib arm 
and 432 patients in the placebo arm) stratified by BRAF mutation status (V600E, V600K) and disease stage 
(IIIA,  IIIB,  IIIC).  Median  FU  was  2.8  years.  With  a  total  of  414  RFS  events  (38%  in  the 
dabrafenib+trametinib arm  and 57% in the placebo  arm), HR was 0.47 (CI95% 0.39-0.58) in favour of

arm.  The  estimated  RFS  rates  at  year  2  were  67%  for  the  dabrafenib+trametinib  arm  and  44%  in  the 
placebo arm, at year 3 were 58% and 39%. With 153 deaths [60 (14%) in the combination-therapy group 
and 93 (22%) in the placebo group] at the first IA, OS HR was 0.57 (95%CI 0.42-0.79; p=0.0006) in favour 
of the dabrafenib+trametinib. Despite this low P value, the between-group difference was not significant 
because it did not cross the prespecified conservative interim boundary of P=0.00001915. 
In BRAF mutation-positive melanoma, also vemurafenib, a BRAF-inhibitor, given alone for one year, was 
evaluated in the BRIM8 trial versus placebo. The study enrolled 184 patients in cohort 2 (stage IIIC) and 314 
patients in cohort 1 (stage IIC–IIIA–IIIB) cohort 1, showing in cohort 2 median DFS of 23.1 vs 15.4 months 
with vemurafenib vs placebo respectively (HR 0·80 p=0·026) and in cohort 1 median DFS NR vs 36.9 months 
with  vemurafenib  vs  placebo  respectively  (HR  0·54,  p=0·0010).  The  result  however  was  not  significant 
because  of the  prespecified hierarchical prerequisite for the primary DFS analysis of cohort 2 to show a 
significant DFS benefit16.

Treatment for metastatic or unresectable melanoma 
According  to  ESMO  guidelines,  in  patients  with  unresectable,  metastatic  disease  with  BRAF  WT  tumor, 
preferred options are clinical trials or anti-PD1 antibody. Other option is anti-CTLA4 inhibitor. For subjects 
with melanoma harboring BRAF mutation, options are clinical trials or BRAF+MEK inhibitors or anti-PD-1 
antibody or anti-CTLA4 antibody9. With regard to anti-PD1 antibodies, both pembrolizumab and nivolumab 
are currently EU approved in the advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma setting. Nivolumab is 
also approved in combination with ipilimumab, although, relative to nivolumab monotherapy, an increase in 
PFS and OS for the combination of nivolumab with ipilimumab is established only in patients with low tumour 
PD-L1 expression (Opdivo SmPC, Yervoy SmPC).

About the product 
Keytruda  (pembrolizumab)  is  a  humanized  monoclonal  anti-PD-1  antibody  that  blocks  the  interaction 
between  programmed  cell  death  1  (PD-1)  receptor  and  its  ligands,  programmed  cell  death  1  ligand  1 
(PD-L1)  and  programmed  cell  death  1  ligand  2  (PD-L2).  The  PD-1  pathway,  especially  the  PD-1 
receptor-ligand  interaction,  represents  a  major  immune-control  switch  that  may  be  engaged  by  ligands 
expressed  in  the  tumour  microenvironment  to  overcome  active  antitumor-specific  T  cell  immune 
surveillance. 
Keytruda is currently approved in EU for the treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma 
in adults. In addition, Keytruda is approved in metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma, refractory classical 
Hodgkin lymphoma and advanced/metastatic urothelial carcinoma. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The application is based on study KEYNOTE-054; a randomized, double-blind, phase 3 study conducted in 
collaboration with the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), undertaken to 
evaluate adjuvant therapy with pembrolizumab compared to placebo in patients with resected high-risk 
melanoma (Stage IIIA [> 1 mm lymph node metastasis], IIIB and IIIC). 
The MAH submitted the following indication: 
  KEYTRUDA as monotherapy is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of melanoma in adults with 
lymph node involvement who have undergone complete resection. 
The final agreed indication was as follows: 
  KEYTRUDA as monotherapy is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of adults with Stage III 
melanoma and lymph node involvement who have undergone complete resection (see section 5.1). 
For the adjuvant treatment of melanoma, KEYTRUDA should be administered until disease recurrence, 
unacceptable toxicity, or for a duration of up to one year. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The  applicant  did  not  submit  an  environmental  risk  assessment.  According  to  the  “Guideline  on  the 
Environmental  Risk  Assessment  of  Medicinal  Products  for  Human  Use”  (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), 
pembrolizumab is exempt from preparation of an Environmental Risk Assessment as pembrolizumab is a 
protein and does not pose a significant risk to the environment. 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The lack of non-clinical data is acceptable as the indication is in the same disease that has been previously 
approved. Pembrolizumab, being a protein is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption 
Keytruda (pembrolizumab) is a humanized monoclonal anti-PD-1 antibody. Keytruda is administered via IV 
and therefore is 100% bioavailable.  
Over the course of recent clinical development, pembrolizumab PK disposition has been characterized via 
pooled  population  PK  analyses  using  serum  concentration-time  data  contributed  from  subjects  across 
various clinical studies. While earlier population PK analyses were conducted using a two-compartment PK 
structural model with static clearance (CL) (i.e. no time-dependent changes in CL, referred to as a ‘static 
model’),  more  recent  analyses  have  included  a  time-dependent  pharmacokinetic  (TDPK)  component  for 
characterizing on-study changes in CL, with the intent of improving description of long-term pembrolizumab 
concentration-time data.  
Based on the previous (Static Model) and current (TDPK Model) population PK analysis, the pembrolizumab 
PK profile is typical for a therapeutic mAb. Consistent with a limited extravascular distribution, the volume of 
distribution  of  pembrolizumab  at  steady  state  is  small  (6.0  L;  coefficient  of  variation  [CV%]:  20%).  As 
expected  for  an  antibody,  pembrolizumab  does  not  bind  to  plasma  proteins  in  a  specific  manner. 
Pembrolizumab CL is approximately 23% lower (geometric mean, 195 mL/day [CV%: 40%]) after achieving 
maximal change at steady state compared with the first dose (252 mL/day [CV%: 37%]). Steady state is

predicted to be achieved after approximately 16 weeks (for the intended dosing regimen of 200 mg Q3W). 
Elimination half-life (t1/2) is 22 days (32%) at steady-state. 
Pembrolizumab  is  approved  at  dosing  regimens  of  2  mg/kg  or  200  mg  Q3W  for  multiple  advanced  or 
metastatic indications globally, as listed below. Currently, the 200 mg Q3W dose is also being evaluated in 
multiple clinical studies. 
• Melanoma: US (200 mg Q3W), EU and Japan (2 mg/kg Q3W), other countries (200 mg or 2 mg/kg Q3W) 
• NSCLC: US, EU (only in 1L) and Japan (200 mg Q3W), other countries (200 mg or 2 mg/kg Q3W) 
• HNSCC: US (200 mg Q3W) 
• Classical HL: US and EU (200 mg Q3W in adults); US (2 mg/kg [up to 200 mg] Q3W in pediatrics) 
• Urothelial carcinoma: US, EU, and Japan (200 mg Q3W) 
• MSI-H cancer: US (200 mg Q3W in adults and 2 mg/kg [up to 200 mg] Q3W in pediatrics) 
• Gastric cancer: US (200 mg Q3W) 
The recommended dose of pembrolizumab for the treatment of subjects with melanoma in the adjuvant 
setting is 200 mg Q3W. This is based on the similarity in PK of pembrolizumab across multiple approved 
indications including melanoma. 
No  new  information  regarding  Pharmacokinetics  for  pembrolizumab  is  available  within  this  extension  of 
indication. 
Analytical methods 
No new methods have been introduced.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Immunogenicity 
The existing immunogenicity assessment for pembrolizumab monotherapy in the non-adjuvant (advanced 
or metastatic) setting is based on a dataset of 3727 subjects across several indications (melanoma, NSCLC, 
HNSCC, MSI-H, HL and UC subjects). Out of 3727 subjects, 2034 were evaluable for ADA. The observed 
incidence of treatment emergent ADA in these evaluable subjects was 1.8% (36 out of 2034). In the last 
immunogenicity  dataset  of  the  36  treatment  emergent  ADA  positive  subjects,  9  tested  positive  in  the 
neutralizing assay, accounting for a total incidence rate of treatment emergent neutralizing positive subjects 
of  0.4%  (9  out  2043)  in  the  overall  population.  Finally,  pembrolizumab  exposure  did  not  change  in  the 
presence of ADAs or neutralizing antibodies as currently summarized in the USPI and EU SmPC. 
This  submission  informs  on  immunogenicity  potential  of  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  in  subjects  with 
melanoma treated in the adjuvant setting (KEYNOTE-054). Immunogenicity in the adjuvant setting has not 
been characterized previously.  
Immunogenicity evaluation for study KEYNOTE-054 
For pembrolizumab monotherapy in the adjuvant treatment setting, ADA samples were available from 500 
subjects. A subset of the subjects was not assessable for drug-induced immunogenicity analysis, because 
the subjects were not treated with pembrolizumab or did not have a post-treatment ADA sample available 
(N=4). In total 496 subjects were included in the immunogenicity analysis. The following table shows an 
overview of the immunogenicity status for all 496 assessable subjects.

Table 3: 
Summary of subject immunogenicity status after pembrolizumab monotherapy in 
the adjuvant treatment setting (200 mg Q3W) 
The  observed  incidence  of  treatment  emergent  ADA  in  evaluable  subjects  treated  with  pembrolizumab 
monotherapy  in  the  adjuvant  treatment  setting  is  3.4%  (17  out  of  495),  based  on  17  subjects  with 
treatment  emergent  positive,  5  with  non-treatment  emergent  positive,  and  473  with  negative 
immunogenicity status. One subject was considered as inconclusive.  
None of the 17 treatment emergent positive subjects had antibodies with neutralizing capacity, yielding an 
incidence of treatment emergent neutralizing positive subjects of 0% (0 out of 495). 
Impact of ADA on Pembrolizumab Exposure 
Pembrolizumab levels observed in subjects with ADA positive samples, were compared with  pembrolizumab 
levels in subjects the ADA negative or ADA inconclusive samples subjects, all treated with the same regimen.

2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Based on the similarity in PK of pembrolizumab across multiple approved indications including melanoma, no 
further evaluation of the PK profile for pembrolizumab monotherapy was considered necessary and thus no 
PK analysis was conducted in study KEYNOTE-054. Based on previous assessments pembrolizumab CL is 
approximately 23% lower (geometric mean, 195 mL/day [CV%: 40%]) after achieving maximal change at 
steady state compared with the first dose (252 mL/day [CV%: 37%]) but this decrease in CL with time is not 
considered clinically meaningful. 
The applicant analysed the ADA formation and its impact on pembrolizumab exposure, as the information on 
the development of ADA is still limited in the adjuvant treatment setting. The methods used for quantitation 
of pembrolizumab in human serum and for the determination of ADA corresponded to the validated methods 
applied in previous submissions. Since the bioanalytical reports for PK and ADA assessment were interim 
reports, the applicant was asked to provide the final bioanalytical study reports once the study KN-054 is 
completed.  
Pembrolizumab concentration was determined to be above the LLOQ in a total of 4 pre-treatment samples 
(range:  39.6  –  11600  ng/mL).  The  applicant  was  asked  to  comment  on  this  unexpected  finding.  The 
applicant responded that in order to find the root cause for detectable drug concentrations at baseline in 4 
pre-treat  samples,  a  systematic  investigation  was  triggered.  No  root  cause  for  this  matter  has  been 
identified,  although  the  investigation  continues  and  any  additional  findings  will  be  included  in  the  final 
bioanalytical report. Considering that drug levels in samples from this study were generated solely to aid in 
interpretation  of  immunogenicity  and  all  4  subjects  in  question  were  ADA  negative  at  all  time  points 
collected, no impact to the study results is expected.  
A total of 500 subjects from study KEYNOTE-054 (subjects with melanoma treated in the adjuvant setting) 
were included in the immunogenicity assessment, 495 subjects were evaluable.  
The incidence for treatment-emergent ADA in evaluable subjects was 3.4% (17 of 495; 473 negative, 5 
non-treatment-emergent  positive  and  17  treatment-emergent  positive).    None  of  the  17  treatment 
emergent positive subjects, had antibodies with neutralizing capacity, yielding  an incidence of treatment 
Assessment report  
EMA/800978/2018 
Page 19/106 
 
  
  
 
 
emergent neutralizing positive subjects of 0% (0 out of 495). These findings are slightly higher than the 
overall  incidence  in  the  non-adjuvant  setting  (1.8%).  However,  there  was  no  incidence  of 
treatment-emergent neutralizing positive subjects in the adjuvant treatment setting (0 out of 17), which is 
consistent with the low incidence seen in the non-adjuvant setting (0.4%). 
For all of the ADA positive subjects (5 non-treatment emergent and 17 treatment emergent positive), the 
pembrolizumab  exposure  was  comparable  to  that  for  subjects  with  ADA  negative  or  ADA  inconclusive 
samples treated with the same regimen.  
Impact of neutralizing positive antibodies on exposure cannot be determined as none of the ADA positive 
subjects had antibodies with neutralizing capacity. 
The comparison of RFS between the positive population (treatment emergent and non-treatment emergent 
positive  subjects)  and  negative  population  (negative  and  inconclusive  subjects)  is  limited  by  the  small 
number of subjects in the positive populations and no conclusions can be drawn. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The  PK  characteristics  for  pembrolizumab  are  considered  also  acceptable  for  the  adjuvant  melanoma 
setting.  Overall,  no  significant  difference  in  the  incidence  or  characteristics  of  anti-pembrolizumab 
antibodies was detected in the adjuvant as compared to the non-adjuvant treatment setting. Furthermore, 
no impact of treatment-emergent ADA was observed on pembrolizumab exposure, efficacy, or safety which 
is consistent with the results of prior immunogenicity evaluations of pembrolizumab in the non-adjuvant 
monotherapy setting. 
The CHMP recommends the following measures necessary to address the issues related to pharmacology: 


2023. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
To support the Keytruda extension of indication in adjuvant melanoma, the efficacy data in this submission 
are  based  on  the  interim  analysis  results  of  a  single  pivotal  study  conducted  in  collaboration  with  the 
European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), KEYNOTE-054 (EORTC1325), an 
ongoing, international, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized Phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy 
and safety of adjuvant therapy with pembrolizumab in subjects with completely resected stage IIIA (>1 mm 
LN metastasis), IIIB, and IIIC melanoma (AJCC 7th edition, 2010). Eligible subjects included those who had 
not received prior systemic therapy for melanoma, except adjuvant IFN for a previous melanoma without LN 
involvement.  
The CRS is based on the results of an interim analysis from Part 1 per data cutoff date of 02-OCT-2017. Part 
2 is ongoing and not included in this submission. 
The  MAH  is  seeking  the  following  indication:  “KEYTRUDA  as  monotherapy  is  indicated  for  the  adjuvant 
treatment of melanoma in adults with lymph node involvement who have undergone complete resection”.

The pembrolizumab dose regimen of 200 mg Q3W for this and other studies in the pembrolizumab program 
was selected based on population  PK simulations. The  PK simulations showed that a 200 mg fixed dose 
provides  (1)  adequate  and  similar  control  of  PK  variability  relative  to  a  weight-based  regimen,  and  (2) 
exposures similar to, or slightly higher than, those obtained at 2 mg/kg dose Q3W and, therefore, well within

melanoma metastatic to lymph node, classified as (AJCC, 2010) stage IIIA (>1 mm lymph node metastasis), 
any stage IIIB, or stage IIIC. No past or current intransit metastases or satellitosis.  
(Patient  population  IIIA  (>  1  mm  metastasis)  was  capped  at  a  maximum  of  20%  of  the  total  patient 
population.) 
2. Had tumour sample evaluable for PD-L1 expression (central laboratory testing).  
4. Had disease status for the post-surgery baseline assessment documented by full chest/abdomen/pelvis 
CT and/or MRI with neck CT and/or MRI (for head and neck primaries) and complete clinical examination 
after the informed consent and prior to enrollment. 
5. Post lymph node dissection radiotherapy must have been completed within the 13 week post-surgery 
period and prior to treatment start. 
6. Had ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. 
7. Had interval from surgery to first study drug treatment ≤13 weeks. 
8. Had adequate organ function. 
Key exclusion criteria: 
1. Had mucosal or ocular melanoma. 
2. Had  current disease, including loco-regional  relapse, distant metastasis, or clinical evidence  for brain 
metastases. 
3.  Had  prior  therapy  for  melanoma  except  surgery  for  primary  melanoma  lesions;  subjects  who  had 
previously received IFN for thick primary melanomas without evidence of lymph node involvement were

7. Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), active Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C. 
8. Received prior treatment with any anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibody, anti-PD-1, anti- PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 
agent. 
PD-L1  status:  Enrollment  was  open  to  all  subjects  regardless  of  PD-L1  tumour  expression  but  enrolled 
subjects were required to provide a newly obtained tumour tissue specimen for PD-L1 determination. PD-L1 
tumour expression was measured using the MEL score, which counts tumour cells and associated immune 
cells  in  the  tumour  nests  expressing  PD-L1.  Tumour  samples  were  predefined  using  the  MEL  score  as 
PD-L1-positive if the MEL score was ≥2 (i.e. staining on ≥1% of cells) or PD-L1-negative if the MEL score was 
0 or 1 (i.e. staining on <1% of cells). PD-L1 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry using the 
22C3 antibody.  
The following conditions require patient discontinuation from study treatment: 
  Recurrence (defined as appearance of one or more new melanoma lesions: local, regional or distant). 
Upon recurrence, the treatment will be unblinded. 
  Normal completion of the protocol treatment (one year, which is calculated from the date of the first 
dose) 
  AE or intercurrent illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, warrants the patient’s withdrawal from 
study treatment. 
  Specific conditions described in the Management of Adverse Events. 


Subjects were evaluated with CT and/or MRI scans to assess disease recurrence: the first imaging scan was 
to occur within 6 weeks prior to randomization,  and  subsequent imaging occurred every 12 weeks until 
disease recurrence. In the case of discontinuation due to disease recurrence, the recurrence scan date was 
used  as  the  reference  date  for  scheduling  future  imaging  scans.  For  subjects  who  discontinued  in  the 
absence of disease recurrence, imaging workup was performed every 12 weeks for the first 2 years, every 
6 months for Years 3 to 5, and annually thereafter. 
Recurrence is defined as appearance of one or more new melanoma lesions: local, regional or distant. The 
first  date  when  recurrence  was  observed  is  taken  into  account  regardless  the  method  of  assessment. 
Therefore, recurrence will be declared for any lesion when: 
  Only imaging was performed and progression confirmed. 
  Only  pathology  was  done  and  malignancy  confirmed  (in  solitary  or  in  doubtful  lesions,  cutaneous, 
subcutaneous or lymph node lesions). 
  Both pathology and imaging were done and progression/malignancy confirmed. In this case, whatever 
examination came first, its date is considered to be the date of recurrence. 
Progression/recurrence-free survival 2 (PRFS2) is defined as the time between the date of randomization 
and the earliest of the following: 
 
date of 1st disease progression per RECIST 1.1 (Appendix O) beyond the initial unresectable disease 
recurrence (e.g. unresectable distant metastases); 
 
date  of  2nd  recurrence  in  patients  without  evidence  of  disease  after  surgery  of  a  resectable  1st 
recurrence (e.g. local regional recurrences or resectable distant metastases); 
 
death. 
For patients who remain alive and whose disease has not recurred, or disease has recurred but subsequent 
disease progression or recurrence has not occurred, PRFS2 will be censored on the date of last visit/contact 
with disease assessments or date of last follow up. 
Sample size 
The study is powered for the primary endpoint, RFS. Based on data of the EORTC 18071 study, RFS hazard 
rates for placebo were assumed to be 0.54 pre-1 year and 0.25 post-1 year from randomization; a total of 
409 events (local/regional/distant metastasis/death) for RFS were needed to provide 95% power to detect 
a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.70 (1-sided logrank test, alpha=2.5%) or an increase of the median RFS from 1.64 
to 2.87 years (median ratio=1.75). This corresponds also to an increase of 10.2% (from 58.3% to 68.5%) 
in the 1-year RFS rate (see Table below).  
The power could also be 92% according to the multiplicity strategy which allocates alpha=1.4% to RFS.   
A total of approximately 900 eligible patients (450 patients per arm) were planned to be randomized, up to 
2.5% additional patients may be enrolled in order to compensate ineligible patients and early consent 
withdrawal. In addition, if by the time the targeted enrollment is completed there were patients in 
consenting process, they were authorized to be randomized in the study.

Table 6:  
Estimation of RFS events 
The total accrual period was supposed to be approximately 2 years. Assuming that the hazard of patient 
drop-out  for  RFS  evaluation  would  have  been  0.015  per  year  in  the  placebo  vs  0.03  per  year  in  the 
Pembrolizumab  arm,  during  the  first  year,  and  0.015  subsequently  in  both  arms,  the  required  409  RFS 
events  are  supposed  be  reached  after  a  subsequent  follow-up  of  approximately  12  months  (i.e. 
approximately 3.0 years from the start of the trial). Approximately 6-9 months thereafter, once the data are 
complete and correct, the data-base was planned to be locked for RFS final analysis.   
RFS for the PD-L1+ subgroup is the other main endpoint of the study. The power is presented for the PD-L1+ 
subgroup  where  the  events  in  the  subgroup  range  from  30%-60%  of  the  409  overall  RFS  events,  the 
subgroup HR=0.55, 0.6, 0.65, or 0.7 and alpha is allocated (if the RFS hypothesis for the overall population 
is not rejected) or alpha=0.025 (if the hypothesis for overall population is rejected). Under these scenarios, 
the power for the subgroup ranges from 41% to 100%.

Randomisation 
The  central  electronic  randomization  system  (IVRS)  assigned  according  to  a  1:1  ratio  each  subject  a 
treatment dynamically, based on the other subjects randomized in the study and the following stratification 
factors: 
  Stage (IIIA (> 1 mm metastasis) vs. IIIB vs. IIIC 1-3 positive lymph nodes vs. IIIC ≥4 positive lymph 
nodes) 
  Region (North America, European countries, Australia and other countries as designated) 
The treatment should start no later than 13 weeks after surgery and only after complete wound healing from

Blinding (masking) 
KEYNOTE-054 was a double-blind study. 
Statistical methods 
All the main analyses of the efficacy endpoints for the interim analysis 1 (RFS) were performed on the ITT 
population (efficacy population) following the ITT principle.  
The Kaplan-Meier technique was used to obtain estimates of the survival-type distributions (RFS). Medians 
were presented with a 95% confidence interval based on the non-parametric method of Brookmeyer and 
Crowley. The comparison of the time-to-event  distributions (RFS)  between the  two treatment arms was 
done using the log-rank test stratified by stage, as indicated at randomization. The HR was estimated using 
a Cox proportional hazards (PH) model, stratified by stage, with treatment as the single covariate. The same 
method was stated to be applied to PRFS2.  
Multiplicity adjustment 
According to the multiplicity strategy (Bonferroni-Holm), the hypothesis for the overall population will first 
be tested at alpha=1.4%. If the hypothesis for the PD-L1+ subgroup is rejected at the allocated alpha, then 
the hypothesis for the overall population will be tested at alpha=2.5%. 
The "graphical approach" to testing the hypotheses that the Pembrolizumab and placebo groups differ with 
respect to RFS, DMFS and OS is shown below. RFS, DMFS and OS are planned to be tested sequentially 
(initial 1-sided alpha allocation 0.025, 0 and 0, respectively). Both hypotheses (for the overall population 
Assessment report  
EMA/800978/2018 
Page 27/106 
 
  
  
 
and for the PD-L1+ subgroup) must be rejected to proceed to the next endpoint and 100% of the alpha 
moves to the next endpoint.  
For  each  endpoint,  alpha  allocation  was  determined  as  follows.  For  the  overall  population,  1-sided 
alpha=0.014. For the PD-L1+ subgroup, the allocated alpha will be calculated as a function of the event ratio 
(number of observed events in the PD-L1+ subgroup: total number of observed events) using a method by 
Spiessen and Debois.  
At the time of OS final analysis, an assessment of the long term treatment impact on RFS and DMFS will be 
evaluated as well. 
Interim analysis 
One  interim  analysis  was  planned  and  introduced  in  Amendment  02  for  assessing  superiority  of 
pembrolizumab over placebo with respect to the improvement of RFS in the overall population. The interim 
analysis was planned to occur after approximately 330 RFS events have been reported. The analysis was 
performed by an unblinded statistician not connected with the project. The final RFS analysis is planned to 
occur either immediately after the interim analysis is performed (if superiority is concluded at the time of the 
interim analysis) or after 409 RFS events have been observed (if superiority is not concluded at the time of 
the interim analysis).    
The  O’Brien-Fleming  stopping  boundaries  for  the  interim  analysis  is  based  on  the  Lan-DeMets  alpha 
spending  function  and  derived  considering  the  exact  number  of  reported  RFS  events.  The  Table  below 
displays the operating characteristics of the interim analysis, in case 330 RFS events have been reported, 
superiority would be concluded if the observed RFS hazard ratio is ≤0.76. 
Table 7: 
Operating characteristics for the interim analysis

After the RFS final analysis, patients will continue to be followed for the efficacy endpoints: RFS (for those 
still alive and disease-recurrence free), DMFS (for those still alive and distant -metastasis free) and OS (for 
those still alive). 
Sensitivity analysis 
For the efficacy endpoints, the following sensitivity analyses were planned:  
 
 
 
 
a re-randomization test to ensure true randomization via minimization   
an analysis considering the stratification factor (AJCC stage) information as indicated on the CRFs, based 
on pathology report(s) and applying the AJCC staging rules.  
a Per Protocol Treatment (PPT) analysis.  
adjusting the treatment comparison by additional factors which appeared to be of prognostic importance 
(multivariate Cox model) and assessing possible interaction between a factor and treatment effect. 
 
applying two different set of censoring rules (table below) in order to evaluate the robustness of the RFS 
endpoint.

Protocol amendment: 
Table 9:  
Summary of protocol amendments 
Main changes are summarised below:  
Amendment 054-01 (07-Jul-2015) 
  Added exploratory endpoint, progression/recurrence-free survival 2 (PRFS2) 
 
Eligibility  criteria  were  revised  to  include  in situ  carcinoma  and  implementation  of  contraception 
guidelines based on the National recommendations for UK and Scandinavian countries. 
Amendment 054-02 (02-Oct-2017) 
  Implemented an interim analysis for RFS and updated data monitoring section. The addition of a RFS 
interim analysis has been justified based on newly available data released in September 2017.17 
  Clarified eligibility section and instructions for medical monitoring of adverse events during enrolment. 
  Clarified adjuvant treatment duration, withdrawal criteria, and the use of radiotherapy. 
Protocol deviations 
EORTC reported a total of 1914 significant protocol deviations according to their process. A clinical review of 
these significant protocol deviations documented as of the data cutoff date, according to the MSD process 
and ICH E3 guidelines, determined that only 69 met the criteria for important protocol deviations, which 
included subjects who: 
  Were  randomized  but  did  not  meet  eligibility  criteria  that  impacted  safety  and/or  efficacy  (n=14), 
including in-transit or satellite metastasis (resected) (n = 8), newly diagnosed hypothyroidism and not 
on replacement therapy at baseline (n = 2), pancreatic adenocarcinoma present on baseline imaging 
and diagnosed at Week 12 (n = 1), elevated bilirubin (n = 1), prior treatment with IFN-alpha after a prior

melanoma (n = 1), 
  Developed treatment discontinuation criteria but were not discontinued from the study (n=4), 
  Received incorrect study treatment (n=6), 
  Had a reportable SAE and/or follow up safety event information not reported per timelines outlined in the 
protocol due to delayed reporting by investigators of secondary malignancies (eg, SCC, BCC, and new 
primary melanoma) (n = 44), 
  Did not comply with the study procedures which impact safety or data integrity (n=1). 
No subjects were excluded from the analyses as none of the important protocol deviations were considered 
by the MAH to have the potential to negatively impact the integrity of the analyses.  
Premature unblinding 
A total of 14 subjects were unblinded during follow-up for RFS. Of the 14, 10 were unblinded due to safety 
concerns. Four subjects were unblinded during follow-up due to new primary melanoma.

The numbers of patients who received post lymph-node dissection radiotherapy were 49/514 (9.5%) and 
57/505 (11.3%) in the pembrolizumab and placebo group, respectively. 
Concomitant treatments: systemic antineoplastic agents were not permitted during the study; however, 
topical  agents  were  permitted.  Topical  fluorouracil  use  was  reported  for  3  subjects  (0.6%)  in  the 
pembrolizumab  group  and  1  subject  (0.2%)  in  the  placebo  group.  Systemic  corticosteroids  were 
administered to 23.0% of subjects in the pembrolizumab group and 10.5% of subjects in the placebo group.  
Numbers analysed 
A total of 1464 subjects were screened and 1019 randomized (ITT population), 514 in the pembrolizumab 
group and 505 in the placebo group. 
A total of 8 subjects were randomized but not treated (5 in the pembrolizumab and 3 in the placebo group).

Recurrence-free Survival (RFS) – updated analyses (cut-off date 2 May 2018) 
As per CHMP request, the MAH presented updated analyses with a data cut-off date of 2 May 2018 (i.e. 7 
months after the IA cut-off date of 2 Oct 2017 previously reported) for a median follow-up duration of 21.6 
months. A total of 404 RFS events occurred (vs 351 at the IA), 30.7% in the pembrolizumab vs 48.7% in 
the placebo arm. The number of events almost reached the planned final number of 409 RFS events.

The curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The circles and triangles indicate the time of censoring. The 
log-rank test stratified by stage at randomization is used to draw inference. The estimate of the hazard ratio is based on a 
Cox model stratified by stage at randomization. For the hazard ratio, 98.4% CI is presented, corresponding to a one-sided 
significance level of 0.008

 Recurrence-free survival is defined as time from randomization to the date of first recurrence (local, regional, distant metastasis) or 
death (whatever the cause), whichever occurs first. 
 † From product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) method for censored data. 
 ‡ Based on Cox regression model with treatment as a covariate stratified by stage (IIIA [>1 mm metastasis] vs. IIIB vs. IIIC 1-3 nodes 
vs. IIIC >=4 nodes) as indicated at randomization.

KEYNOTE-054 was designed when melanoma  was staged according to AJCC’s manual 7th  Edition, but in 
current clinical practice the 8th Edition is used. In the latter, a series of changes have further subdivided 
stage III into four categories (IIIA, IIIB, IIIC and IIID) regarding the previous three (IIIA, IIIB and IIIC) 
from  the  7th  Edition.  Upon  CHMP  request,  the  MAH  added  a  re-classification  table,  performed  an  RFS 
analysis stratified by stage according to AJCC 8th edition and provided subgroup analyses by cancer stage 
according to AJCC 8th edition.

Figure 11: 
RFS Kaplan-Meier curves according to BRAF status 
For patients with BRAF mutation “unknown” (36 patients in pembrolizumab and 29 patients in the placebo 
arm), 5 (13.9%) RFS events were observed in the pembrolizumab arm and 4 (13.8%) events in the placebo 
arm. The median RFS was not reached in both arms. The RFS rate at month 6 was 91.7% (95% CI: 76.3, 
97.2) and 89.7% (95% CI: 71.3, 96.5). The HR was 0.95 (95% CI: 0.25, 3.64).

Progression/Recurrence-free Survival 2 (PRFS2) 
PRFS2 was defined as the time in days between the date of randomization and the earliest of the following: 
date  of  1st  disease  progression  per  RECIST  1.1  after  the  initial  unresectable  disease  recurrence  (e.g. 
unresectable  distant  metastases);  date  of  2nd  recurrence  in  patients  without  evidence  of  disease  after 
surgery of a resectable 1st recurrence (e.g. local regional recurrences or resectable distant metastases); 
death. For patients who remain alive and whose disease has not recurred, or whose disease has recurred but 
subsequent disease progression or recurrence has not occurred, PRFS2 was censored on the date of last 
visit/contact with disease assessments or date of last follow up.

Time to First Subsequent Therapy (TFST) 
TFST is defined as the time between randomization and either first post-protocol systemic therapy after 
recurrence or death, whichever occurred first. Treatment in Part 2 of the study is considered as post-protocol 
systemic therapy. Patients without a record of death or post-protocol systemic therapy after recurrence are 
censored at the latest of the following dates: randomization, the end of treatment visit, recurrence, last 
disease  evaluation  for  recurrence-free  survival,  last  visit  when  information  about  further  treatment 
administration was recorded. A first subsequent systemic therapy (or death) was recorded in 220 patients 
on the placebo arm compared to 107 on the pembrolizumab arm.

KMKaplan-Meier method; CoxCox model 
The curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The circles and triangles indicate the time of censoring. The 
estimate of the hazard ratio is based on a Cox model 
Distant Metastatis free survival (DMFS) and Overall survival (OS): at the time of the data cut-off, 
the minimum number of events needed to analyze the endpoints of DMFS and OS had not been achieved.  
Therefore, KEYNOTE-054 will continue until the minimum number of protocol-specified events required to 
analyze each of these endpoints has been observed.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
KN054  is  an  ongoing  Phase  3,  randomized,  double-blind  clinical  trial  to  examine  pembrolizumab  versus 
placebo as adjuvant treatment after complete resection of high-risk stage III cutaneous melanoma.  
Enrolled  subjects  had  stage  IIIA  (with  lymph  node  metastasis  >1  mm),  stage  IIIB,  or  IIIC  cutaneous 
melanoma. No past or current in-transit metastases or satellitosis were allowed. Staging was performed 
according to AJCC 7th edition, while the classification currently in use since January 2018 is the AJCC 8th 
edition. This is not however considered an issue, based also on the requested indication (melanoma “with 
lymph node involvement”). Enrollment of stage IIIA patients was capped at 20% of the total population.  
The study was designed based on experiences drawn from the EORTC 18071 study (ipilimumab vs placebo 
in adjuvant melanoma) where enrolled Stage IIIA (> 1 mm) were 21%. The stage IIIA (> 1 mm lymph node 
metastasis) patient population was capped at a maximum of 20% in order to prevent dilution of the patient 
population with those not at high risk for recurrence, and moreover, enriched the patient population by only 
enrolling patients with a high risk of recurrence. Therefore it is deemed reasonable to have a 20% cap in 
order to allow a timely read out of the impact of pembrolizumab on RFS and OS. 
Patients were required to have had complete (R0) resection, including a complete lymph node dissection, 
within 13 weeks from first treatment dose; the benefit of lymph node dissection was recently confirmed to 
confer only regional disease control without a benefit for OS. Enrollment was open to all subjects regardless 
of PD-L1 tumour expression, which was centrally measured by IHC using the MEL score and measuring the 
number of PD-L1 positive tumour cells and associated immune cells in the tumour nests [PD-L1 positive = 
MEL score ≥2 (i.e. staining on ≥1% of cells); PD-L1 negative = MEL score 0-1 (i.e. staining on <1% of 
cells)].   
The  use  of  placebo  as  comparator  was  accepted  by  the  CHMP 
in  the  Scientific  Advice 
(EMEA/H/SA/2437/6/2014/II), as IFN, although approved, was not widely used in the EU and its efficacy 
was modest. Ipilimumab (which is not approved in EU) study results were promising but not yet mature  at 
the time when the trial was starting (June 2015). Nevertheless, the CHMP underlined that superiority over 
Assessment report  
EMA/800978/2018 
Page 52/106 
 
  
  
 
 
placebo must be convincing enough in every subgroup to exclude a posteriori that IFN would have performed 
similarly, with a possible inferiority of pembrolizumab.   
The treatment phase of KN054 consisted of two parts: Part 1 (Adjuvant Therapy): pembrolizumab 200 mg 
or placebo was administered Q3W for a total of 18 administrations (~1 year) or until disease recurrence or 
unacceptable  toxicity;  Part  2  (after  first  recurrence):  Crossover  or  Re-challenge  with  pembrolizumab 
treatment. This submission includes interim efficacy data from Part 1 only of the study as of the data cutoff 
date 02-OCT-2017; Part 2 is ongoing and was not included in this submission. The duration of Part 1 of the 
trial is reflected in the SmPC as the recommended treatment period (i.e. one year of adjuvant treatment). It 
should be noted that since a shorter or longer treatment duration was not investigated in this trial design, it 
is not possible to determine whether there might be a more appropriate treatment duration. 
Dual primary endpoints were investigator’s assessed recurrence free survival (RFS), defined as the time 
between the date of randomization and the date of first recurrence (local, regional, distant metastasis) or 
death (whatever the cause), whichever occurs first, in the ITT population and in subjects with PD-L1-positive 
tumours. The primary endpoint RFS was considered  acceptable by the CHMP  in the context of  Scientific 
Advice. 
DMFS and OS, both in the ITT and in PD-L1-positive populations, are secondary endpoints. QoL and RPFS2 
are among the exploratory endpoints. The first imaging scan was within 6 weeks prior to randomization, and 
subsequent imaging occurred every 12 weeks until disease recurrence. For subjects who discontinued in the 
absence of disease recurrence, imaging was performed every 12 weeks for the first 2 years, every 6 months 
for Years 3 to 5, and annually thereafter. A sample subset of imaging (the first 100 investigator-reported 
recurrence.  i.e.  36  from  the  pembrolizumab  arm  and  64  from  the  placebo  arm)  has  been  reviewed 
independently by central reviewer in order to assess the adequacy of the site reader performance on this 
trial, as suggested by CHMP in the SA, showing a 91% of concordance rate (defined as the percentage of 
BICR-defined recurrence dates being within one consecutive scan time point of the investigator-reported 
recurrence date).  
Subjects  were  randomized  using  a  minimization  technique  stratifying  according  to  stage  and  region. 
Dynamic  allocation  (such  as  minimisation)  is  usually  not  recommended  and  should  be  avoided,  unless 
justified. The re-randomization test was provided and the p-value was <0.001 (the value of the primary 
analysis p<0.0001), which was reassuring on the robustness of the primary analysis. 
A total of 900 subjects (approximately 450 per arm) were planned to be randomized to achieve 409 RFS 
events. This sample size was able to detect an HR of 0.7 (increase of the median RFS from 1.64 to 2.87 
years, i.e. roughly 15 months of improvement) with power 95% and two-sided alpha 5%. A total of 1019 
patients were recruited, likely due to the high number of centres involved. The sample size was powered as 
well to assess an RFS improvement in PD-L1+ subgroup, assuming a range of values for the event rate in the 
placebo group, different hypotheses on HR at two different alpha level. Under the scenario of event rate 
equal to 50%, HR=0.55 and alpha=0.025, that is for similar condition observed in this study, the power for 
the subgroup was 97%.  
The statistical methods used for the analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints are considered overall 
adequate. Clarifications regarding several minor methodological issues have been requested and have been 
provided by the MAH. The RFS analysis stratified by stage and region as indicated at randomization showed 
no remarkable difference with the result of the primary analysis. Sensitivity analyses as per the protocol 
overall showed consistent results with the primary RFS analysis. 
An interim analysis for RFS in the ITT population, to be conducted after 330 RFS events (i.e. ~80% of the 
409 final planned RFS events), was added with Amendment 02 (final protocol version MK-3475-054-02). It 
is noted that this amendment was finalized on the same date of the data cut-off for the interim analysis 
(02-OCT-2017).  The main limit of this analysis is the relatively short follow-up, with very limited information 
Assessment report  
EMA/800978/2018 
Page 53/106 
 
  
  
on the outcome in the experimental arm after the end of the 12-month treatment period. The applicant 
provided an explanation for this interim analysis: newly available data regarding the adjuvant melanoma 
treatment17 triggered an earlier RFS event cut-off than originally planned.  The explanation is considered 
acceptable. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The  dossier  is based on  the  RFS  interim  analysis  with  a  data  cut-off  date  of 02-OCT-2017.  The  median 
follow-up was 16 months. Patients were recruited between 22-JUL-2015 and 14-NOV-2016 at 134 centers in 
23  countries  worldwide.  A  total  of  1019  patients  were  randomized,  514  to  pembrolizumab  and  505  to 
placebo arm. Among the 445 patients not randomized, the most frequent reason of non randomization was 
current disease, including locoregional relapse, distant metastasis, or clinical evidence of brain metastases. 
According to MSD’s review, 69 important protocol deviations have been reported. Based on the information 
provided, it appears unlikely that they have significantly impacted on the final results.  
Subjects were primarily male (61.6%), <65 years of age (median age 54.0 years), and about 94% had 
ECOG  PS  0.  Stage  IIIA  comprised  15.7%  of  the  study  population  in  both  treatment  groups  (below  the 
protocol-specified  cap  of  20%),  45.8%  were  stage  IIIB  and  38.4%  stage  IIIC.  The  majority  of  subjects 
(83.7%) had PD-L1-positive tumours and approximately half of the overall population (49.8%) had tumours 
positive for a BRAF V600 mutation.  Baseline  characteristics appeared well balanced between arms.  Post 
lymph-node  dissection  radiotherapy  was  used  similarly  in  both  arms  was  similar  in  both  arms  (9.5%  in 
pembrolizumab and 11.3% in placebo). 
Overall,  approximately  half  the  subjects  completed  the  adjuvant  treatment  in  both  arms.  More 
discontinuations due to AE (13.6 vs 2.2), as expected, occurred in the pembrolizumab compared to placebo 
arm, as well as more withdrawal by subjects (4.1 vs 1.6%). 
With a total of 351 RFS events [135 (26.3%) in the pembrolizumab arm and 216 (42.8%) in the placebo 
arm], pembrolizumab demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in RFS versus placebo in the ITT 
population (HR = 0.57; 98.4% CI: 0.43, 0.74; p<0.0001). Median RFS had not yet been reached in the 
pembrolizumab group, but had been reached in the placebo group (20.4 months, 95%CI 16.2-NR). The 
6-months RFS rate was 82.2% (95%CI 78.6, 85.3) vs 73.3% (95%CI 69.2, 77), the 1-year RFS rate was 
75.4% (95% CI: 71.3, 78.9) vs 61.0% (95% CI: 56.5, 65.1) in the pembrolizumab vs the placebo group, 
respectively. The Kaplan-Meier curves separate after 3 months and remain separated throughout, although 
curves  are  difficult  to  interpret  after  approximately  month  10  due  to the  high  rate  of  censoring.  In  this 
regard, an updated RFS analysis was requested and provided by the MAH (cut-off date 2 May 2018): a total 
of 404 RFS events were  reported (vs 351 at  the  prior  cut-off date of  2-Oct-2017). This means that the 
initially  defined  number  of  409  RFS  events  required  to  analyse  this  endpoint  has  approximately  been 
reached. The updated analysis continues to show a benefit of pembrolizumab adjuvant therapy over placebo 
with a HR of 0.56 (98.4%  CI: 0.44-0.72; p<0.0001)  consistent  with  the  interim  RFS data.  A sensitivity 
analysis  considering  the  start  of  a  new  anticancer  treatment  as  an  event  had  comparable  result  to  the 
primary RFS analysis (HR=0.56). 
Distant  metastases  developed  in  69  subjects  (13.4%)  in  the  pembrolizumab  group  compared  with  114 
subjects  (22.6%)  in  the  placebo  group.  Information  on  patients,  if  any,  who  developed  new  primary 
melanoma and how such patients were handled in the primary RFS analysis, were requested. New primary 
melanoma were not counted as RFS events in the primary efficacy analysis in KN054 study, differently from 
other 
recent  adjuvant 
trials  CheckMate-238 
(nivolumab  vs 
ipilimumab)  and  COMBI-AD 
(dabrafenib/trametinib vs placebo). The MAH clarified that 19 subjects (7 in the pembrolizumab group, 12 in 
the placebo group) had a new primary melanoma. Four of 19 subjects, all in the placebo group, had a second 
primary after recurrence  for the current melanoma,  and all remaining 15 subjects were censored  in the

analysis. As the number of patients with new primary melanoma is limited and balanced between arms, and 
given the RFS advantage with pembrolizumab seen in the ITT population, a significant impact on the RFS 
result is not expected.  
RFS results in subjects with PD-L1-positive tumours (dual primary) were similar to those obtained in the 
overall population (HR=0.54; 95% CI: 0.42, 0.69; p<0.0001). An RFS advantage with pembrolizumab over 
placebo was seen regardless of PD-L1 status. Indeed, HR in subjects with PD-L1 negative tumour was 0.47 
(95%CI 0.26-0.85), acknowledging that the analysis was neither prespecified nor multiplicity-controlled, 
and the limited number of patients (59 and 57 in pembrolizumab and placebo group, respectively). A higher 
rate of pembrolizumab-treated patients with an RFS event is noted in the PD-L1 negative compared to PD-L1 
positive subgroup (33.9% and 23.8%, respectively). It is to note that patients were not stratified by PD-L1 
status. Some imbalances in baseline characteristics were noted, in particular in BRAF mutation status (BRAF 
mutated 32% vs 49%). According to a multivariate cox regression model, it appeared that no confounding 
factors have influenced the observed treatment effect on PD-L1 negative population. The results for PD-L1 
"unknown” (HR 0.88) is to be interpreted with caution, given the small numbers in this subgroup. The CHMP 
requests 
that 
the  MAH 
investigates  biomarkers  other 
than  PD-L1  expression  status  by 
Immunohistochemistry  (IHC)  (e.g.  PD-L2,  RNA  signature,  etc.)  predictive  of  pembrolizumab  efficacy  in 
adjuvant  melanoma,  in  addition  to  more  information  regarding  the  pattern  of  expression  of  PD  L1  (see 
Annex II of the SmPC). 
Overall, RFS benefit of pembrolizumab over placebo appears consistent in the subgroups analysed. A more 
limited effect in younger patients (<50 years, HR 0.76) is noted. In an explorative Cox-regression the MAH 
was requested to assess the possible impact of age (as covariate) on the HR. It is noted that RFS rates differ 
between the separate age groups. Lower RFS rates are observed with increasing age. However, this trend is 
observed  in  both  treatment  groups  with  HRs  being  in  favour  of  pembrolizumab  compared  to  placebo 
regardless  of  age  group,  which  is  reassuring  that  efficacy  of  pembrolizumab  is  observed  across  all  age 
groups. 
As expected, the event rate for RFS is different according to stage. Although the data is immature and the 
number of patients with stage IIIA disease is small, it appears that there is an advantage for the use of 
pembrolizumab in the adjuvant setting in patients with stage IIIA that have a lower risk of recurrence (7.5% 
vs 22.5% of stage IIIA patients having an RFS event). In an updated analysis of RFS by stage, despite a 
minimal increase in HR for stages IIIA, IIIB and IIIC (1-3LN) the updated results remain to be in favour of 
pembrolizumab throughout all stages.  
The MAH was also requested to analyse RFS according to the new melanoma staging AJCC 8th edition (2017), 
as  at  the  time  of  the  study  the  previous  AJCC  7th  edition  classification  was  in  place  and  used  in 
KEYNOTE-054. An increasing RFS advantage of pembrolizumab over placebo was seen for higher stages of 
disease (2 May 2018 updated cut-off: IIIA 0.84, IIIB 0.59, IIIC 0.45). For stage IIID, HR was 0.69 with 
95%CI 0.28-1.37, but the number of patients is limited (19 in pembrolizumab and 20 in placebo arm). With 
regard to stage IIIA, at lower risk of recurrence, RFS HR was 0.84 (99%CI 0.14-3.54) in stage IIIA according 
to the new 8th edition classification, compared to the HR=0.38 (95%CI 0.14, 1.01) in stage IIIA according to 
7th edition (2 May 2018 cut-off date).  Stage IIIA according to AJCC 8th edition identifies a patient population 
with better prognosis as compared to stage IIIA according to 7th edition, with a 5-years melanoma specific 
survival rate of 93%4 . Patients according to the new stage IIIA (8th edition) are very poorly represented in 
the  study  (i.e.  42  patients  with  stage  IIIA  on  pembrolizumab  versus  40  patients  with  stage  IIIA  in  the 
placebo group) and with a very small number of RFS events (6 in the pembro and 7 in the placebo arm) 
observed  based  on  the  updated  data.  Thus,  the  efficacy  data  is  limited  in  this  patient  population  and  a 
statement has been included to section 5.1 of the SmPC. The treating physician should take into account the 
toxicity of adjuvant treatment for subjects with such a good prognosis. 
Assessment report  
EMA/800978/2018

Pembrolizumab improved RFS both in the BRAF mutated (HR=0.49) and BRAF wild-type (HR=0.64) tumours 
compared to placebo. For subgroup analyses by type and number of lymph nodes, presence of ulceration 
and Breslow thickness RFS results were overall consistent with those from the ITT population.   
Additional preliminary data were submitted upon CHMP request and considered supportive for the conclusion 
(data not shown). The CHMP has requested the MAH to submit the final RFS/DMFS data by 4Q 2023 (see 
Annex II of the SmPC). 
The OS analysisis not part of the statistical analysis plan for IA1.The CHMP has requested the MAH to submit 
the final OS data by 4Q 2023 (see Annex II of the SmPC). 
At the data cut-off date of 2-OCT-2017, patients from the placebo arm who crossed over to pembrolizumab 
were  109  (21.6%).  Only  one  patient  (0.2%)  in  the  pembrolizumab  arm  was  rechallenged  with 
pembrolizumab (both crossover and rechallenge were at the discretion of the investigator for Part 2 of the 
study). Updated analysis of systemic treatment showed, as expected,  more patients in the placebo arm 
receiving an anti PD-1/PD-L1 agent at recurrence (approximately 80%, vs 30% in the pembrolizumab arm). 
A  similar  rate  of  subjects  in  each  arm  received  radiotherapy,  chemotherapy,  BRAF/MEK  inhibitors  and 
anti-CTLA4,  while  surgery  was  more  used  in  the  pembrolizumab  arm  compared  to  control  (46.2%  vs 
38.8%).   
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The  efficacy  of  pembrolizumab  over  placebo  as  adjuvant  treatment  for  stage  III  melanoma  in  the  ITT 
population has been demonstrated by statistically significant and clinically relevant increase in RFS.  The 
results initially submitted, based on interim analyses, were confirmed by the updated efficacy analyses. It is 
considered that the data are stable enough to conclude on the efficacy endpoint. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
1.  The value of biomarkers to predict the efficacy of pembrolizumab should be further explored, 
specifically: 
Additional biomarkers other than PD-L1 expression status by Immunohistochemistry (IHC) (e.g. PD-L2, 
RNA signature, etc.) predictive of pembrolizumab efficacy should be investigated together with more 
information regarding the pattern of expression of PD-L1  obtained in the ongoing NSCLC studies (P001, 
P010, P024 and P042), urothelial carcinoma studies (KN045, KN052), HNSCC study (KN040)  and 
adjuvant melanoma (KN-716): 
  Genomic analyses using whole exome sequencing and/or RNAseq (e.g. Nanostring RNA gene 
signature) 
IHC staining for PD-L2 
 
  Data on RNA and proteomic serum profiling 
As the initial efficacy assessment is based on a surrogate endpoint, which requires verification of the 
impact of the intervention on clinical outcome or disease progression or confirmation of previous 
efficacy assumptions, the MAH is requested to submit the following: 
2.  Post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES): In order to investigate the long term efficacy in melanoma 
patients treated with adjuvant pembrolizumab, the MAH should submit the final RFS/DMFS and OS data 
for study KN-054: A Phase III Clinical Trial of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in Subjects with complete 
resection of high-risk Stage III melanoma. 
The clinical study report should be submitted by 4Q 2023.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety database in support of the current application comprises the following datasets: 
  KEYNOTE-054  Safety  Dataset  (N=509):  Pembrolizumab-treated  subjects  with  resected, 
LN-positive, stage III melanoma comprise the KEYNOTE-054 Safety Dataset. 
  Reference  Safety  Dataset  (N=2799):  The  2799  pembrolizumab-treated  subjects  in  the  RSD 
consists of 1567 subjects with advanced melanoma from studies KEYNOTE-001, KEYNOTE-002, and 
KEYNOTE-006, and 1232 subjects with NSCLC from studies KEYNOTE-001 and KEYNOTE-010. This 
dataset represents the established safety profile for pembrolizumab in the melanoma and NSCLC 
indications. 
  Cumulative  Running  Safety  Dataset  (N=4993):  Subjects  from  the  KEYNOTE-054  Safety 
Dataset,  the  RSD,  and  subjects  treated  with  pembrolizumab  in  KEYNOTE-001  (NSCLC  and 
melanoma),  KEYNOTE-002  (melanoma),  KEYNOTE-006  (melanoma),  KEYNOTE-010  (NSCLC), 
KEYNOTE-012 (HNSCC: Cohorts B and B2, urothelial tract cancer: Cohort C, and gastric cancer: 
Cohort D), KEYNOTE-013 (classical HL: Cohort 3; rrPMBCL: Cohort 4A), KEYNOTE-024 (NSCLC), 
KEYNOTE-045 (urothelial carcinoma), KEYNOTE-052 (urothelial carcinoma), KEYNOTE-059 (gastric 
cancer: Cohort 1), KEYNOTE-08 7 (classical HL), KEYNOTE-164 (colorectal carcinoma: Cohort A), 
and KEYNOTE-170 (rrPMBCL or rrRS) comprise the Cumulative Running Safety Dataset. 
Patient exposure 
KEYNOTE-054 is an ongoing study. As of the data cutoff 02-OCT-2017, a total of 509 subjects received at 
least 1 dose of pembrolizumab as Adjuvant Therapy (ASaT population for KEYNOTE-054). 
Exposure in KEYNOTE-054 is summarised in the following table:

A  pre-specified  list  of  PTs  was  developed  by  the  Sponsor  to  consistently  characterize  the  nature  and 
frequency of each AEOSI across the clinical program, regardless of causality as reported by investigators. 
These PTs are considered to be medically equivalent to the immune-mediated events and infusion-related 
reactions. The list of PTs is continually updated based on emerging pembrolizumab safety data. Version 13.0 
was used at the time of the database lock of 27-NOV-2017.

Post marketing experience 
The safety profile of  pembrolizumab was summarized  in the Periodic Safety Update Report covering the 
period  04-MAR-2017  through  03-SEP-2017.  There  is  no  post-marketing  data  of  pembrolizumab  in  the 
indication of adjuvant melanoma. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The randomised, double-blind, Phase III study KEYNOTE-054 provides safety information in support of the 
current application, with a total population of 509 stage III melanoma patients treated with pembrolizumab 
200 mg Q3W as adjuvant therapy (ASaT population), in comparison with a control arm (placebo) of 502 
patients (1:1 randomisation scheme). Additional safety comparative data are provided based on the prior 
clinical experience of pembrolizumab monotherapy in the non-adjuvant treatment setting, with a pooled 
dataset comprising melanoma and NSCLC patients (Reference Dataset; N=2799), as well as the totality of 
clinical trials conducted so far (Cumulative Running Safety Dataset; N=4993).  
The  comparable  length  of  exposure  between  treatment  arms  (375  days  in  median  in  both  the 
pembrolizumab and placebo group) in study KEYNOTE-054, enables a controlled long-term safety evaluation 
of the proposed therapy. As expected, the comparison with placebo showed an unfavourable safety profile of 
pembrolizumab in the adjuvant setting of resectable melanoma; even though a rather high proportion of 
drug-related AEs was reported in placebo-treated patients (66.1% vs 77.8% in pembrolizumab group), the 
incidence  of  drug-related  grade  3-5  AEs  (14.5  %  vs  3.4%),  drug-related  SAEs  (13%  vs  1.2%),  drug 
Assessment report  
EMA/800978/2018 
Page 82/106 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
discontinuations due to either drug-related AEs (12.2% vs 5.2%) or drug-related SAEs (4.3% vs 3.6%) were 
all more frequent in the experimental group compared to control. Moreover, two pembrolizumab-related 
fatalities were found between tabled results and subject narratives (discrepancies in the number of deaths 
across the dossier have been clarified by the MAH), while one death unrelated to the study medication was 
reported in the placebo group. 
The safety profile of pembrolizumab is consistent with prior experience, although it must be acknowledged 
that  a  lower  incidence  of  grade  3-5  AEs,  SAEs  and  drug-modifications  due  to  AEs  were  reported  in 
KEYNOTE-054 compared to the reference datasets. This is likely to be explained by the younger age and 
better clinical performance as well as the nature of cancer disease in the KEYNOTE-054 study population, 
which recruited patients with localised and resected melanoma but otherwise healthy, compared with the 
advanced stage of metastatic disease of the reference database.  
The very commonly reported ADRs of KEYTRUDA including rash, diarrhea, nausea, pruritus and fatigue were 
also among the main overall AEs in KEYNOTE-054. However, with the exception of rash (13.2% vs 8.6% in 
pembrolizumab  and  placebo,  respectively)  and  pruritus  (19.4%  vs  11.6%),  no  major  differences  were 
observed in the frequency of the other events between treatment arms (nausea: 17.3% vs 14.5%; diarrhea: 
27.7% vs 25.9%; fatigue:  33% vs 33.5% in  pembrolizumab and placebo, respectively). Other common 
ADRs  such  as  decreased  appetite,  dyspnoea,  influenza-like  syndrome,  dry  mouth  and  vomiting  were 
observed more often in pembrolizumab-treated patients than controls, although with a similar frequency 
than  the  reference  database.  Notably,  pembrolizumab-treated  patients  presented  with  a  significantly 
increased  rate  of  thyroid  dysfunction  than  controls  (14.7%  vs  2.8%  and  10.4%  vs  1.2  for  hypo  and 
hyperthyroidism,  respectively),  even  more  common  than  in  previous  trials.  Relevant  info  is  reflected  in 
section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
Drug-related  AEs  showed  a  preponderance  of  endocrine  disturbances  in  the  comparison  between 
pembrolizumab  and  placebo,  their  incidence  in  the  experimental  group  being  higher  than  previously 
reported (24% in KEYNOTE-054 vs 10.5% in the RSD and 11.8% in the Cumulative Running RDS, including 
both  hypo  and  hyperthyroidism).  Asthenia,  headache,  dyspnoea  and  alanine  aminotransferase  that  also 
were  among  the  most  frequently  reported  drug-related  AEs  in  KEYNOTE-054,  occurred  with  a  higher 
incidence than previously observed. With the exception of infusion-related reactions, anaphylactic reaction, 
skin reactions and myositis, all the remaining AEOSI were more frequent in KEYNOTE-054 than prior trials.  
The majority of drug-related AEOSI in the pembrolizumab group were of grade 2 in severity (95/173; 55%), 
required therapy in 32% of cases, and 72.2% of events resolved (with or without sequelae). In the placebo 
group, AEOSI that were related to treatment by Investigators occurred at a significantly lower rate (7.6% vs 
34% in the experimental arm), were mostly of Grade 1 (20/38; 53%), and required immunosuppressive 
therapy in 21% of cases; 68% of AEOSI resolved (with or without sequelae). Duration of AEOSI were similar 
in both groups (43 days in median). Hypothyroidism (14.7% vs 2.8%) and hyperthyroidism (10.4% vs 1.2% 
in pembrolizumab and control group, respectively) were the prevailing AEOSI reported in the study.  
AEOSI  were  also  among  the  leading  causes  of  drug-related  Grade  3-5  AEs.  Colitis  and  Type  1  diabetes 
mellitus  were  the  most  commonly  reported  AEs  within  this  category.  Differences  compared  to  the  prior 
clinical  experience  mainly  relate  to  the  incidence  of  type  1  diabetes,  whose  higher  rate  in 
pembrolizumab-treated patients in KEYNOTE-054 is likely to have been triggered by their longer time on 
treatment (time-to-onset was 64 days in  median, range:43-315).  Colitis and pneumonitis were also the 
main  pembrolizumab-related  SAEs  in  KEYNOTE-054,  with  colitis,  but  not  pneumonitis,  being  more 
frequently reported than in the reference datasets (1.6% vs 0.9%). Neither colitis nor pneumonitis were 
observed in the placebo group.  
The  increased  risk  of  drug-related  AEs  and  AEOSI  is  likely  to  be  attributed  to  the  longer  exposure  in 
KEYNOTE-054 (375 days in median) compared to the reference datasets (127 and 135 days in the RSD and 
Cumulative Running dataset), with an overall AEOSI time-to-onset of 85 days in median, ranging between 
Assessment report  
EMA/800978/2018 
Page 83/106 
 
  
  
1 and 423 days. Out of a total of 509 subjects in the pembrolizumab arm receiving at least one dose of study 
treatment, 173 (34%) experienced at least one AEOSI. As more than 60% of AEOSI were reported as not 
resolved,  given  the  long  survival  expected  in  the  adjuvant  setting,  more  details  have  been  requested, 
showing  that  most  common  not-resolved  AEOSI  were  attributable  to  thyroid  disorders  which  can  be 
managed with hormone replacement therapy. However, although less commonly, severe AEOSIs also with 
serious long term consequences can occur. It is underlined that pembrolizumab SmPC has been recently 
modified  (II/58  procedure)  to  include  a  clearer  warning  in  4.4  that  “Immune-related  adverse  reactions, 
including severe and fatal cases, have occurred in patients receiving pembrolizumab.”. 
A summary of the laboratory abnormalities based on the cumulative safety dataset has been added to the 
SmPC in section 4.8. 
Two  deaths  were  reported  in  the  pembrolizumab  arm,  including  a  drug-reaction  with  eosinophilia  and 
systemic symptoms, and a case of immune-mediated myositis considered related to pembrolizumab by the 
Investigator. In the placebo group, one death due myocardial infarction was observed (unrelated to study 
treatment).  
There  was  an  age-dependent  increase  in  drug-related  AEs  of  Grade  3-5  in  severity  and  SAEs  in  the 
pembrolizumab  arm.  Tolerability  to  pembrolizumab  was  particularly  reduced  in  patients  aged  ≥75  years 
compared to younger  subgroups (28.6% vs 12%  in  patients <50 years for drug-related grade 3-5 AEs; 
21.4% vs 12.5% in patients <50 years for drug-related SAEs). Therefore, a warning has been included in 
section 4.4 of the SmPC that a trend toward increased frequency of severe and serious adverse reactions in 
patients  ≥  75  years  was  observed.  Safety  data  of  pembrolizumab  in  the  adjuvant  melanoma  setting  in 
patients ≥ 75 years are limited. With regard to gender subgroup analyses, more drug-related AEs (82.5% 
versus 75%) and drug-related SAEs (16.4% versus 10.9%) were observed in the female ASaT population 
treated with pembrolizumab. Overall, female subjects tended to tolerate treatment with pembrolizumab less 
well than male subjects. This differs from the so far available AE profile by gender observed in the RSD and 
in the Cumulative Running Safety Dataset, where no distinct difference was observed between male and 
female subjects. Since these observations from the KEYNOTE-054 data set are based on 189 female subjects 
(compared to 320 male subjects), this finding cannot be attributed to a low number of female subjects in the 
KN054 population. The Applicant was therefore requested to comment on the increased SAE and study drug 
discontinuation rates in female subjects. There were higher frequencies in females versus males for different 
AE  categories  also  observed  not  only  in  the  pembrolizumab  arm  but  also  in  the  placebo  cohort,  (e.g., 
drug-related AEs were observed in 73.0% of female subjects in the placebo arm vs. 61.6% of male subjects; 
and SAEs were observed in 19.5% of females vs. 14.2% of males in the placebo arm). This is indicative that 
the differences observed may be the result of random variability within the patient population.  
As regards immunogenicity, the incidence of treatment-emergent ADA to pembrolizumab in subjects with 
melanoma treated in the adjuvant setting is higher than the overall incidence in the non-adjuvant setting 
(3.4% versus 2%). However, there was no incidence of treatment-emergent neutralizing positive subjects in 
the  adjuvant  treatment  setting  (0  out  of  17),  which  is  consistent  with  the  low  incidence  seen  in  the 
non-adjuvant  setting.  Furthermore,  similar  to  the  non-adjuvant  setting,  there  was  no  impact  of 
treatment-emergent ADA observed on pembrolizumab exposure, efficacy, or safety. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
There were no new safety signals observed in study KN-054 in the pembrolizumab treatment arm in the 
adjuvant setting of completely resected stage III melanoma. The ADRs observed were generally 
manageable as the severity was mainly of Grade 1-2.  Drug-related grade 3-5 AEs, drug-related SAEs and 
drug-related fatalities occurred more often in the experimental arm than placebo, which is expected, and 
frequencies were generally comparable to what has been observed with pembrolizumab monotherapy in the 
non-adjuvant setting. However, an increased rate of AEOSI mainly related to endocrine disturbances 
Assessment report  
EMA/800978/2018 
Page 84/106 
 
  
  
(thyroid dysfunction and type 1 diabetes) occurred, likely due to the longer exposure of patients in 
KEYNOTE-054 than in prior trials. No specific warning has been included in the PI as the risks of 
hypothyroidism (myxoedema), hypophysitis (hypopituitarism) thyroiditis (autoimmune thyroiditis and 
thyroid disorder) and diabetes type 1 have already been reflected in the PI previously. Therefore, for the 
adjuvant treatment of melanoma, Keytruda should be administered until disease recurrence, unacceptable 
toxicity, or for a duration of up to one year (see SmPC 4.2).

As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. 
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: the changes to the 
product information are considered minor and in relation to the new indication, hence, the changes do not 
affect the readability of the package leaflet.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
The MAH is seeking an extension of indication for KEYTRUDA monotherapy as adjuvant treatment of adult 
melanoma patients with lymph node involvement who have undergone complete resection,  based on the 
interim results of study KEYNOTE-054.  
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Melanoma  is  a  malignant  tumour  that  originates  from  melanocytic  cells  and  primarily  involves  the  skin, 
causing 90% of skin cancer mortality1. The European incidence of malignant melanoma varies from 3 to 
5/100  000/year  in  Mediterranean  countries  to  12–25  in  Nordic  countries,  and  a  disparity  in  the 
mortality-to-incidence  ratios  between  Western  and  Eastern  European  countries  has  been  observed2.  Its 
incidence  continues  to  rise  worldwide.  Median  age  at  diagnosis  is  59  years.  However,  melanoma  is  not 
uncommon among individuals younger than 30 years, being the second most commonly diagnosed cancer 
(after lymphomas) among adolescents and young adults3. 
The major environmental risk factor for melanoma is ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Increased UV light exposure 
of a genetically predisposed population seems  to be,  at least in  part,  responsible  for  an  ongoing  rise  in 
incidence2. 
Approximately 90% of melanomas are diagnosed as primary tumors without evidence of metastasis. The 
outcome of melanoma depends on the stage at presentation. For early-stage melanoma, surgical resection 
is the standard treatment and is associated with an excellent long-term survival prognosis for stage I (98%) 
and stage II (90%). However, patients with stage III disease, who have regional involvement at diagnosis, 
are at higher risk or recurrence after locoregional resections. Lymph node tumour burden at the time of 
staging, ulceration, and Breslow thickness of the primary melanoma are the most predictive independent 
factors for survival in patients with stage III disease. 
Staging of melanoma as of January 2018 is now performed using the AJCC 8th edition TNM classification4; 
however, at the time of KEYNOTE-054 protocol development and initiation of subject enrollment, the AJCC 
7th edition was in effect for TNM staging.   
At the time of protocol development, 5-year survival rates reported by AJCC 7th edition for patients with 
stage  IIIA,  IIIB,  and  IIIC  melanoma  were  78%,  59%,  and  40%,  respectively5.  The  5-year 
melanoma-specific survival rates according to the current AJCC 8th edition Staging Guidelines are 93%, 
83%, 69%, and 32% for stage IIIA, IIIB, IIIC, and IIID, respectively4. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Surgical  excision  is  the  primary  treatment  for  melanoma.  Adjuvant  therapy  is  offered  to  patients  who 
present without evidence of macroscopic metastases but are at high risk of having microscopic metastases 
and relapse.  
According to the ESMO guidelines, patients with resected stage III are evaluated for IFN therapy: patients 
with  microscopic  regional  nodal  involvement  and/or  ulcerated  primaries  are  most  likely  to  benefit.  For 
patients  with  ≥stage  IIIB,  clinical  trials  or  high-dose  IFN-α-2b  are  options.  High-dose  IFN-α-2b  is  an 
approved indication and offered in some European countries for high risk resected stage II or III melanoma 
on the basis of reduction in RFS, although not universally because of marginal OS benefit and the significant 
toxicity. Observation is frequently used as the standard of care in Europe1,2,9.

Nivolumab  and  the  combination  dabrafenib/trametinib  (for  BRAF  mutated  tumors)  have  been  recently 
approved  for  the  adjuvant  treatment  of  melanoma.  The  approved  indication  for  nivolumab  is  as 
monotherapy  for  the  adjuvant  treatment  of  adults  with  melanoma  with  involvement  of  lymph  nodes  or 
metastatic disease who have undergone complete resection (see section 5.1). The approved indication for 
dabrafenib in combination with trametinib is for the  adjuvant treatment of adult patients with Stage III 
melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation, following complete resection. 
Pembrolizumab is currently EU approved in the advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma setting. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The  current  application  is  based  upon  results  of  the  Phase  III  KEYNOTE-054  trial,  a  Randomized, 
Double-Blind, Study of the EORTC Melanoma Group testing Pembrolizumab versus placebo after complete 
resection of high-risk Stage III (stage III [lymph node metastasis >1 mm], IIIB, IIIC) cutaneous melanoma. 
This is an ongoing study currently at its first RFS interim analysis (data cut-off date: 02-OCT-2017).  
Updated data with a cut-off date of 2 May 2018 has been submitted per CHMP request.   
Investigator’s assessed RFS, in the ITT and in PD-L1-positive population, were dual primary endpoints. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
  Statistically significant improvement in RFS of pembrolizumab versus placebo in the ITT population (HR 
=  0.57;  p<0.0001).  Median  RFS  not  yet  reached  in  the  pembrolizumab  group,  20.4  months  in  the 
placebo  group.  An  updated  RFS  analysis  (data  cut-off  date  2  May  2018)  reaching  almost  the  final 
planned  number  of  RFS  events  (404  vs  409)  confirmed  the  interim  results  (HR=0.56,  98.4%CI 
0.44-0.72, p<0.0001).  
  Advantage of pembrolizumab over placebo seen in the 6-months and 1-year rates. The Kaplan-Meier 
curves separate after 3 months and remain separated throughout. 
  Available sensitivity analyses are supportive of the primary analysis.  
  RFS benefit of pembrolizumab over placebo appears consistent in the subgroups analysed. This include 
subgroups  according  to  PD-L1  expression  (positive  and  negative),  BRAF  mutation  status  and  tumor 
stage (according to AJCC 7th edition). 
 
Fewer  distant  metastases  and  locoregional  recurrences  (as  RFS  event)  were  reported  in  the 
pembrolizumab arm compared to placebo (13.4% vs 22.6% and 15.2% vs 10.7%, respectively). 
  Within the limits of immature analyses, PRFS2 and TFST showed overall consistent estimated hazard 
ratios with RFS and are supporting the benefit of pembrolizumab with regard to delaying the occurrence 
of distant metastasis and  the use of subsequent systemic therapy.  In  addition, at visual  inspection, 
Kaplan Maier curves for RFS, PRFS2 and TFST appear to divide and maintain separated over time.  
  Additional  preliminary  data  were  submitted  upon  CHMP  request  and  considered  supportive  for  the 
conclusion (data not shown).  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
 
The CHMP requests that the MAH submits the final results for RFS/DMFS and OS for study KN-054 to 
confirm the efficacy observed with the interim analyses provided. 
 
PD-L1 was not shown to be a predictive marker for responses in adjuvant melanoma. Nevertheless, The 
CHMP  requests  that  the  MAH  investigates  biomarkers  other  than  PD-L1  expression  status  by 
Assessment report

Page 99/106 
 
  
  
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) (e.g. PD-L2, RNA signature, etc.) predictive of pembrolizumab efficacy in 
adjuvant melanoma, in addition to more information regarding the pattern of expression of PD L1. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
 
The incidence of drug-related AEs (77.8% vs 66.1%), drug-related grade 3-5 AEs (14.5 % vs 3.4%), 
drug-related  SAEs  (13%  vs  1.2%),  drug  discontinuations  due  to  either  drug-related  AEs  (12.2%  vs 
5.2%)  or  drug-related  SAEs  (4.3%  vs  3.6%)  were  all  more  frequent  in  the  pembrolizumab  group 
compared to control. 
  Asthenia, headache, dyspnoea and alanine aminotransferase that also were among the most frequently 
reported drug-related AEs in KEYNOTE-054, occurred with a higher incidence than previously observed. 
With the exception of infusion-related reactions, anaphylactic reaction, skin reactions and myositis, all 
the remaining AEOSI were more frequent in KEYNOTE-054 than prior trials.  
 
Two pembrolizumab-related fatalities were found while one death unrelated to the study medication was 
reported in the placebo group. 
  Drug-related  AEs  showed  a  preponderance  of  endocrine  disturbances  in  the  comparison  between 
pembrolizumab  and placebo, their incidence  in the experimental group being higher than previously 
reported  (24%  in  KEYNOTE-054  vs  10.5%  in  the  RSD  and  11.8%  in  the  Cumulative  Running  RDS, 
including both hypo and hyperthyroidism) 
  Colitis and Type 1 diabetes mellitus were the most commonly reported AEs within the category of Grade 
3-5 AEs; colitis and pneumonitis were also the main pembrolizumab-related SAEs in KEYNOTE-054, with 
colitis, but not pneumonitis, being more frequently reported than in the reference datasets (1.6% vs 
0.9%). Neither colitis nor pneumonitis were observed in the placebo group. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There were no new safety concerns identified during the conduct of the clinical trial. Hence, there are no 
uncertainties on the unfavourable effects.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Pembrolizumab demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in RFS compared to placebo in the ITT 
population  and  in  the  PD-L1  positive  patients  when  used  as  adjuvant  treatment  in  lymph-node  positive 
cutaneous  melanoma  after  complete  resection.  The  data  was  supported  by  subgroup  analyses  and 
sensitivity analyses which reflected the RFS benefit observed in the overall population.  The updated RFS 
analysis, reaching almost the final planned number of RFS events, confirmed the interim RFS result of a 
statistically  significant  RFS  benefit  of  pembrolizumab  over  placebo  and  provides  robustness  to  the 
conclusion that the effect is maintained in the long term.

Within the limits of immature analyses,  PRFS2 and TFST showed overall consistent estimated hazard ratios 
with RFS and are supporting the benefit of pembrolizumab with regard to delaying the occurrence of distant 
metastasis  and  the  use  of  subsequent  systemic  therapy.  In  addition,  at  visual  inspection,  Kaplan  Maier 
curves for RFS, PRFS2 and TFST appear to divide and maintain separated over time. Additional preliminary 
data submitted upon CHMP request were considered supportive for the conclusion (data not shown).    
In terms of safety, there were no new safety risks identified in the trial KN-054 and the safety is similar  to 
what is already known for pembrolizumab. There was an increased incidence of immune-mediated reactions 
including  thyroid  dysfunctions,  type  1  diabetes  mellitus  and  colitis  among  the  most  frequently  reported 
ones. However, these are considered tolerable and manageable with the recommendations as stated in the 
SmPC  as  well  as  additional  risk  minimisation  activities.  Of  note,  the 
incidence  of  these 
pembrolizumab-related AEs was higher than previously observed, most likely in view of a longer exposure to 
treatment in the KEYNOTE-054 than prior trials. Moreover, although the majority was of Grade 2 in severity, 
immunological disturbances gave rise to AEs resolving with sequelae as well as to serious events, including 
fatalities, in otherwise healthy individuals. AEOSI with a not-resolved outcome were 63%, most commonly 
attributable to thyroid disorders which can be managed with hormone replacement therapy. Although less 
commonly, severe AEOSIs also with serious long term consequences can occur. A clearer warning regarding 
the occurrence of severe and fatal cases of immune-related adverse reaction following pembrolizumab has 
been recently introduced in the SmPC. There were too few patients aged ≥75 years to draw conclusion on 
the safety in older age and a warning has been included to this effect in the SmPC. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The CHMP considers that efficacy has been established for pembrolizumab over placebo in the treatment of 
adjuvant melanoma in adult patients with lymph node involvement who have undergone complete resection. 
Additionally, there were no new safety signals observed. Therefore, the benefit-risk balance was concluded 
to be positive. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
RFS benefit for pembrolizumab over placebo was apparent across all stage subgroups according to the AJCC 
7th edition classification, which was the one used in KEYNOTE-054 trial. In order to evaluate the study results 
in light of the currently used AJCC 8th edition staging system, post-hoc RFS subgroup analyses by cancer 
stage according to AJCC 8th Edition were requested. In the new AJCC classification, Stage IIIA identifies a 
patient population with better prognosis as compared to the same stage in 7th edition, with a 5-years 
melanoma specific survival rate of 93%.  There are few patients with stage IIIA according to the new AJCC 
8th edition classification in the study and the number of events is very limited. Therefore, although the 
benefit risk is considered positive in these patients with earlier disease stage, the efficacy data is limited in 
this patient population and a statement has been included to section 5.1 of the SmPC. For subjects with such 
a good prognosis, the treating physician should consider the toxicity of adjuvant treatment with one year of 
pembrolizumab in determining the best course of treatment for the patient. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Keytruda is positive. 
The CHMP recommends the following measures necessary to address the issues related to pharmacology:

1.  The value of biomarkers to predict the efficacy of pembrolizumab should be further explored, 
specifically: 
Additional biomarkers other than PD-L1 expression status by Immunohistochemistry (IHC) (e.g. PD-L2, 
RNA signature, etc.) predictive of pembrolizumab efficacy should be investigated together with more 
information regarding the pattern of expression of PD-L1  obtained in the ongoing NSCLC studies (P001, 
P010, P024 and P042), urothelial carcinoma studies (KN045, KN052), HNSCC study (KN040)  and 
resected Stage II melanoma adjuvant study (KN-716): 
  Genomic analyses using whole exome sequencing and/or RNAseq (e.g. Nanostring RNA gene 
signature) 
IHC staining for PD-L2 
 
  Data on RNA and proteomic serum profiling 
As the initial efficacy assessment is based on a surrogate endpoint, which requires verification of the 
impact of the intervention on clinical outcome or disease progression or confirmation of previous 
efficacy assumptions, the MAH is requested to submit the following: 
2.  Post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES): In order to investigate the long term efficacy in melanoma 
patients treated with adjuvant pembrolizumab, the MAH should submit the final RFS/DMFS and OS data

resection of high-risk Stage III melanoma. 
The clinical study report should be submitted by 4Q 2023 .

DIVERGENT POSITION DATED 18 October 2018 
Keytruda EMEA/H/C/003820/II/47 
The undersigned members of the CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s positive opinion recommending the 
extension of the indication for Keytruda to add the following: 
‘Keytruda as monotherapy is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of adults with stage III melanoma and 
lymph node involvement who have undergone complete resection (see section 5.1)’. 
The reason for divergent opinion was the following: 
According to the natural course of melanoma in patients with lymph node involvement following complete 
resection, the great majority of recurrences will occur within 3 years. The current follow-up of the Phase 
III  KEYNOTE-054  with  interpretable  results  up  to  15  months,  is  not  considered  sufficient  to  establish 
therapeutic efficacy, precluding a positive B/R for Keytruda in the proposed indication.

I. 
SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION  
1.1 
Introduction 
Cetuximab  is  a  chimeric  monoclonal  IgG1  antibody  directed  against  the  epidermal  growth  factor 
receptor  (EGFR).  EGFR  signalling  pathways  are  involved  in  the  control  of  cell  survival,  cell  cycle 
progression,  angiogenesis,  cell  migration  and  cellular  invasion/metastasis.  Cetuximab  binds  to  the 
EGFR  with  an  affinity  higher  than  that  of  endogenous  ligands.  Cetuximab  blocks  binding  of 
endogenous  EGFR  ligands  resulting  in  inhibition  of  the  function  of  the  receptor  and  induces  the 
internalization  of  EGFR,  which  can  lead  to  down-regulation  of  EGFR.  Cetuximab  also  targets 
cytotoxic  immune  effector  cells  towards  EGFR-expressing  tumour  cells  (antibody  dependent  cell-
mediated cytotoxicity, ADCC).  
Erbitux  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  epidermal  growth  factor  receptor  (EGFR)-
expressing, KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer 
in combination with chemotherapy 
as  a  single  agent  in  patients  who  have  failed  oxaliplatin-  and  irinotecan-based  therapy,  and  who  are 
intolerant to irinotecan. 
For the indication squamous cell cancer of the head and neck (SCCHN) approval was granted initially 
in September 2006 followed by an indication enlargement in November 2008: 
Erbitux is indicated for the treatment of patients with squamous cell cancer of the head and neck 
in combination with radiation therapy for locally advanced disease 
in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy for recurrent and/or metastatic disease. 
Erbitux is administered intravenously weekly. 
This is an application for an indication in NSCLC originally proposed as: Erbitux is indicated for first-
line treatment of patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-expressing advanced or 
metastatic non-small cell lung cancer in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy. 
1.2  Clinical aspects 
Altogether four randomised studies in chemotherapy naïve patients with NSCLC have been submitted 
in support of the proposed new indication.

1.2.1  Clinical efficacy 
Main studies 
EMR 62 202-046 
Open, randomized, multicenter phase III study comparing cisplatin + vinorelbine plus cetuximab vs. 
cisplatin + vinorelbine as first-line treatment for subjects with EGFR-expressing, advanced non-small-
cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 
Main Inclusion Criteria: 
• Histologically or cytologically confirmed NSCLC: stage IIIb with documented malignant pleural 
effusion, or stage IV. 
• Immunohistochemical evidence of EGFR expression on tumour tissue. 
• At least 1 bidimensionally measurable index lesion (not in previously irradiated area). 
• ECOG PS of ≤2 at study entry. 
• Adequate renal, liver and bone marrow function. 
Study Treatment and Duration: 
• Cetuximab (initial dose 400 mg/m²; subsequent weekly doses 250 mg/m²)  
3-weekly cycles of CTX: cisplatin (80 mg/m² on Day 1) + vinorelbine (25 mg/m² on Days 1 and 8).  
or 
• Cisplatin + vinorelbine alone at the same dosages. 
CTX was given for a maximum of 6 cycles in case of at least stable disease with discretionary 
continuation of cetuximab as monotherapy in subjects who had received cetuximab. 
The randomization was stratified by ECOG PS of 0–1, versus 2, and disease stage IIIb with pleural 
effusion versus IV. 
Tumour response and progression was assessed at study sites.   
There were three amendments, the most important being that the starting vinorelbine dose was 
decreased from 30 mg/m² to 25 mg/m² due to the high incidence of neutropenia and neutropenic fever 
of any grade (49% and 21%, respectively, pooled analysis of 365 subjects for the DSMB). At that 
point in time 747 subjects had signed the second informed consent. Subjects who had already started 
with 30 mg/m² before the amendment remained on 30 mg/m² if the investigator considered that the 
subject benefited from and tolerated this dose.

More subjects in the CTX group went off study without image-based PD and were therefore censored 
(cetuximab + CTX: 18%; CTX: 24%). The time to treatment failure was therefore calculated as a post 
hoc  sensitivity  analysis,  also  taking  into  account  events  which  were  considered  signs  of  clinical 
progression (non-image-proven PD and start of any new anticancer treatment).

Study CA225099 
A randomized, open label, multicenter phase III study of taxane + carboplatin + cetuximab vs. taxane 
+ carboplatin as first-line treatment for subjects with advanced metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. 
Main Inclusion Criteria: 
• Men and women, age ≥ 18 years. 
• Histologically or cytologically confirmed NSCLC, stage IV or stage IIIb with documented malignant 
pleural effusion, or recurrent disease following radiotherapy or surgical resection. 
• Bidimensionally measurable disease; if the only measurable tumor was in previously irradiated area, 
it had to be regarded as new after completion of radiotherapy. 
• ECOG PS of 0 or 1 at study entry. 
• Adequate renal, liver and bone marrow function. 
Study Treatment and Duration: 
• Cetuximab (initial dose 400 mg/m²; subsequent weekly doses 250 mg/m²)  
+ 3-weekly cycles of CTX, i.e. paclitaxel (225 mg/m² on Day 1) or docetaxel (75 mg/m² on Day 1) 
+ carboplatin (AUC 6). 
or 
• Paclitaxel or docetaxel + carboplatin alone at the same dosages. 
CTX  was  given  for  a  maximum  of  6  cycles  in  case  of  at  least  stable  disease  with  discretionary 
continuation of cetuximab as monotherapy in subjects who had received cetuximab. 
Subjects who  met  eligibility criteria were randomized (phone) in a 1:1 ratio to either C/T/C or T/C. 
The  investigator  specified  which  taxane  the  subject  would  receive,  either  paclitaxel  or  docetaxel. 
Randomization  was  stratified  by  PS  (0  or  1),  investigational  site,  and  intended  on-study  taxane 
(paclitaxel  or  docetaxel)  and  was  carried  out  using  the  Pocock  and  Simon  dynamic  balancing 
algorithm. 
The primary analyses of PFS and tumour response endpoints were based on IRRC assessments.  
There  were  four  protocol  amendments.  Amendment  3  (11-Nov-2005)  changed  the  primary  endpoint 
from response rate to PFS and increased the sample size from 300 to 660.

1.2.2   Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Duration of chemotherapy treatment was limited to 6 cycles in studies EMR 62 202-046, CA225099, 
and CA225100, and to 8 cycles in study EMR 62 202-011. In each of the 4 randomized, controlled 
studies the dose intensity of chemotherapy was reasonably comparable between the cetuximab + CTX 
group and the CTX alone group, but a tendency towards more dose-reductions was seen in the add-on 
arms in study CA225009 as illustrated below. 
Subjects in the cetuximab + CTX groups who discontinued chemotherapy could continue on 
cetuximab monotherapy if they did not have progressive disease. A total of 399/979 (40.8%) subjects 
received cetuximab monotherapy. The median numbers of cetuximab monotherapy infusions in the 
individual studies ranged from 6 to 11. 
Adverse events 
The AE profile of cetuximab is considered well-known: 
• Infusion-related Reactions (IRRs). Mild or moderate IRRs are very common and occur in a close 
temporal relationship mainly to the first cetuximab infusion. Severe IRRs may occur, in rare cases 
with fatal outcome. They usually develop during and up to 1 hour after the end of the initial cetuximab 
infusion, but may occur after several hours or with subsequent infusions. Some of these reactions may 
be anaphylactoid/anaphylactic in nature.  
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• Skin reactions may develop in more than 80% of patients and mainly present as acnelike rash 
and/or, less frequently, as pruritus, dry skin, desquamation, hypertrichosis, or nail disorders.  
Approximately 15% of skin reactions are severe, including single cases of skin necrosis. The majority 
of skin reactions develop within the first 3 weeks of therapy.  
• Very common side effects (≥10% patients): hypomagnesemia, increase in liver enzyme levels, 
mucositis (mild to moderate that may lead to epistaxis). 
• Common side effects (≥1% to <10% patients): headache, conjunctivitis, diarrhoea, dehydration, 
hypocalcemia, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, anorexia that may lead to weight decrease. 
• Uncommon side effects (≥0.1% to <1% patients): blepharitis, keratitis, pulmonary embolism, deep 
vein thrombosis. 
Grade 3 or 4 AEs 
As expected, CTX-related events dominated in the add-on studies. This is illustrated by data on grade 
3 or 4 AEs occurring in ≥5% of subjects or grade 4 AEs occurring in ≥1% of subjects in either 
treatment group in Study EMR 62 202-046 (add-on to cisplatin + vinorelbine)

Randomized, Controlled Studies 
The  overall  incidences  of  deep  vein  thrombosis  and  pulmonary  embolism  in  the  4  randomized, 
controlled  studies  were  higher  in  the  cetuximab  +  CTX  groups  compared  to  the  CTX  groups:  deep 
vein thrombosis 3.1% (30/979) vs 1.6% (16/991) subjects and pulmonary embolism 3.8% (37/979) vs 
2.4%  (24/991)  subjects.  Deep  vein  thrombosis  and  pulmonary  embolism  are  labelled  side  effects  of 
cetuximab.

Number (%) of Subjects with (Febrile) Neutropenia, Septic Events, or Pneumonia in the 
Randomized Controlled Studies 
Frequencies  of  neutropenia  reported  by  the  investigator  as  AEs  were  similar  between  treatment 
groups,  but  neutropenia  findings  based  on  laboratory  values  differed.  Frequencies  of  laboratory 
assessments of neutropenia were higher than those based on AEs, and grade 3 or 4 / grade 4 laboratory 
values were generally more common in the cetuximab + CTX groups than in the CTX control groups.  
The frequency of grade 4 neutropenia was higher in studies EMR 62 202-046 and -011 than in studies 
CA225099  and  CA225100.  However,  laboratory  evaluations  were  performed  more  frequently  in 
studies EMR 62 202-046 and -011.

1.4  Overall Discussion and SAG- Oncology outcome 
Platinum-based  doublets  have  for  long  been  considered  standard  therapy  in  patients  with  advanced 
NSCLC.  Recently,  however,  bevacizumab  was  licensed  as  add-on  therapy  in  patients  with  non-
squamous NSCLC. Bevacizumab is the only targeted therapy that has been approved in combination 
with CTX for the first-line treatment of non-squamous cell NSCLC. At the time of approval (end of 
2007) a statistically significant prolongation of the most relevant endpoint OS time for NSCLC was 
reported  for  the  combination  of  15  mg/kg  bevacizumab  with  carboplatin  +  paclitaxel  (HR  0.79, 
difference in median OS of 2 months).  
It  is  agreed  that  progress  in  the  treatment  of  NSCLC  is  slow.  In  non-squamous  NSCLC  the  HR  for 
ciplatin  +  pemetrexed  vs.  cisplatin  +  gemcitabine  was  0.84,  for  example.  Similarly  the  HR  for  the 
comparison cisplatin + docetaxel vs. cisplatin + vinorelbine was 0.85 and only borderline statistically 
significant.   
Recently, data presented at the ESMO meeting in September 2008 showed that the addition of 7.5 or 
15 mg/kg bevacizumab to cisplatin + gemcitabine did not result in a statistically significant survival 
benefit (HR 0.93 for 7.5 mg/kg and 1.03 for 15 mg/kg bevacizumab, differences in median 0.5 and 0.3 
months, respectively). 
Large  confirmatory  studies  have  been  conducted  with  erlotinib  and  gefitinib  (EGFR  tyrosine  kinase 
inhibitors) as add-on to platinum based regimens without any discernable add-on activity.  
Cetuximab  as  add-on  to  standard  chemotherapies  in  the  treatment  of  advanced  NSCLC  has 
demonstrated  to  increase  tumour  response  rates.  This  increase  appears  unrelated  to  KRAS  mutation 
status,  even  though  data  are  limited.  This  implies  that  the  activity  may  be  unrelated  to  EGFR 
signalling and could be due to e.g. ADCC. Seemingly higher activity in squamous cell carcinoma in 
the two main studies would also indicate that EGFR signalling may not be the main target for activity.  
EGFR  expression,  as  estimated  by  IHC  or  FISH,  may  not  be  of  importance  for  the  activity  of 
cetuximab. 
In the largest study a statistically borderline add-on activity in terms of survival was shown. The add-
on benefit, however, is modest (HR 0.87, corresponding to about 5 weeks median difference), but it is 
acknowledged  that  next-line  therapies,  including  use  of  TK  inhibitors,  might  dilute  the  apparent 
treatment effect. Comparable HR:s for OS have been reported in the other studies submitted in support 
of the application. Pooled analyses using different methodologies indicate that the HR is about 0.88 
corresponding to a median difference of slightly more than 1 month at a p-value of 0.01.   
Add-on activity in terms of prolonged PFS has been less convincingly demonstrated from a statistical 
perspective. The HR of 0.9 corresponds to an estimated median difference of 0.5 months.   
The tolerability/toxicity profile of cetuximab is considered relatively well characterised also as add-on 
to  various  chemotherapy  regimens.  Very  common  and  common  adverse  reactions  of  importance  for 
the tolerability encompass skin reactions, diarrhoea, mucositis, nausea, fatigue, etc. Less common, but 
severe  and  serious  reactions  include  neutropenic  fever,  thromboembolic  complications,  dehydration 
and severe infusion related reactions.  
In all 4 studies, the combined frequencies of subjects with SAEs and grade 4 AEs in all 4 randomized 
controlled  studies  were  56.8%  (556/979)  and  48.6%  (476/979)  for  cetuximab  +  CTX  and  41.3% 
(409/991)  and  40.6%  (402/991)  for  CTX  alone  resulting  in  a  difference  of  15.5%  and  8.0%, 
respectively. 
In the presented trials the estimated benefit of add-on cetuximab to standard chemotherapy in terms of 
survival  is  considered  modest  (HR  0.88)  and  statistically  non-compelling  in  the  light  of  non-
convincing  effects  in  terms  of  PFS.  Documented  benefits  are  not  considered  to  outweigh  the 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
tolerability  and  safety  concerns,  including  an  increased  risk  for  grade  4  AE:s  and  SAE:s  in  studies 
CA225099 and EMR 62202-046. Benefit – risk is thus considered unfavourable.  
The CHMP decided to consult the SAG- Oncology group on the following questions. 
1.  Cetuximab shows a modest add-on activity to platinum-based therapies in the treatment of 
NSCLC. This activity appears not to be affected by KRAS mutation status and the activity 
profile also differs from what has been seen with small molecule EGFR-TK inhibitors. This 
could imply that blockage of EGFR-signalling is not of major importance for the activity of 
cetuximab  in  this  setting.  Antibody  mediated  cytotoxicity  would  be  a  possible  mechanistic 
explanation.  Does  the  SAG  foresee  ways  forward  to  identify  patients  with  increased 
likelihood of response to cetuximab? 
The SAG acknowledged that a substantial effort has been made to identify important clinical and 
biological markers to select likely responders to treatment with cetuximab+chemotherapy. Despite 
such  effort,  no  reliable  markers  could  be  found.  Adequate  samples  were  only  available  in  a 
variable subset of patients, less than 30% for certain analyses, and the outcome in terms of overall 
survival  (OS)  for  such  subsets  was  not  always  comparable  to  the  overall  population.  Thus, 
selection bias in the analysis presented may have contributed to this. The SAG agreed that further 
analyses  of  the  available  samples,  if  possible,  as  well  as  additional  studies  are  strongly 
recommended. Ideally samples should prospectively be saved for broader drug target screens; e.g. 
gene expression profiling with repeated sampling for intrapatient analysis. With modern standards 
cytological  samples  should  give  sufficient  material.  The  rapid  development  of  (c)DNA  based 
sequencing  strategies  may  also  give  important  more  global  insights  into  the  genetic  alterations, 
including those pathways already examined. 
The SAG also agreed that based on the exploratory analyses presented, histology did not seem to 
be a convincing predictor for selecting responders. 
2.  The add-on activity in terms of PFS and OS is modest. Is the benefit considered to outweigh 
the tolerability and toxicity profile of add-on cetuximab? 
The  SAG  agreed  that  OS,  progression-free  survival  (PFS)  health-related  quality  of  life  (HRQL) 
and  toxicity  are  important  clinical  endpoints,  and  that  favourable  effects  need  to  be  balanced 
against the unfavourable ones, particularly grade 3-4 toxicity, treatment-related deaths, and need 
for hospitalisation. 
Concerning OS, a statistically significant effect was observed in the larger pivotal trial EMR 62 
202-046 (“FLEX”) where OS was the primary endpoint and in the pooled analyses of all included 
studies,  but  not  in  exploratory  analyses  of  trial  CA225099  (“099”)  where  this  was  studied  as  a 
secondary  endpoint.  Concerning  the  clinical  significance  of  the  effect  on  OS,  the  SAG 
acknowledged  that  the  statistical  significance  might  primarily  be  due  to  the  high  number  of 
patients enrolled (> 2000) and followed until death, that the improvement in median OS was about 
1  month  (+/-  12  vs  11  months),  that  it  was  consistent  across  studies,  but  transient  and  that  the 
magnitude of the effect was at best of very modest clinical significance. 
Concerning  PFS,  no  statistically  significant  effect  was  observed  in  study  099  (where  this  was 
studied as a primary endpoint) and no convincing effect was shown in exploratory analyses of the 
FLEX  study,  but  PFS  was  statistically  significant  in  the  pooled  analyses  of  all  included  studies. 
Based on conventional estimates, the effect, if any, was considered clinically very marginal. 
Concerning  HRQL,  a  summary  of  the  main  results  was  verbally  presented  by  the  holder  of  the 
marketing  authorisation.  It  was  claimed  that  HRQL  analyses  were  importantly  hampered  by 
missing  data  but  that  no  clinically  relevant  detriment  in  HRQL  was  associated  with 
cetuximab+chemotherapy  compared  to  chemotherapy  alone  in  longitudinal  analyses.  Some 
worsening in the HRQL for certain domains, such as the social functioning around cycle 3, was 
claimed to be associated with skin toxicity. As always, the major problem is the lack of predefined 
domains being the primary end-point, making any conclusions questionable based on HRQL. 
Concerning  toxicity,  the  SAG  agreed  that  cetuximab+chemotherapy  was  associated  with  an 
increase in toxicity compared to chemotherapy alone, particularly about 10% increase in grade 3 
21 
 
 
skin toxicity (skin toxicity grade 1 or more, however,  may be associated with a better outcome-
retrospective observation), and about 6% increase in febrile neutropenia in the FLEX study, or a 
4.2% and 1.1% in grade 3/4 and grade 4 febrile neutropenia, respectively, increase in the pooled 
safety population analysis presented. The marketing authorisation holder claimed that the number 
of hospitalisations due to febrile neutropenia was similar between treatment arms. There was an 
about  11%  increase  in  serious  adverse  events  in  the  pooled  population.  No  data  were  presented 
about need for hospitalisation regardless of cause. 
Concerning  the  balance  of  benefits  and  risks,  the  SAG  members  were  split  into  two  slightly 
different views:  
a.  According to one view, the very modest benefit observed did not outweigh the risks due to the 
observed  toxicity  profile.  From  a  clinical  perspective,  the  tradeoffs  in  terms  of  the  risks 
observed should be at least in the order of 2-3 months improvement in median OS, and this 
should  be  based  on  convincing  clinical  data,  including  supportive  data  on  PFS  and  other 
clinically relevant endpoints. According to this view, the lack of a clearly consistent effect in 
PFS was difficult to explain and may suggest that the effect on OS could be due to treatment 
given after progression.  
b.  According to another view, although very modest in absolute terms, the effect on OS cannot 
be ignored, it is a very relevant effect in relative terms due to the short survival, and is similar 
to incremental improvement achieved with other agents in NSCLC. The added toxicity was of 
some concern but it was considered manageable and in the overall balance did not outweigh 
the benefits in a condition where there are only few treatments with an effect on OS. The lack 
of convincing supportive data in terms of PFS was  considered not to be critical because the 
overall pattern was generally consistent with OS in terms of a favourable treatment effect.  
2. 
Possibility to identify patients with increased likelihood of response to cetuximab 
As requested by the CHMP, the MAH made efforts to identify retrospectively subgroups of patients 
where the benefit of cetuximab treatment would be more pronounced. 
2.1. 
Biomarker analyses  
Following  the  CHMP  request  and  the  presentation  to  the  SAG,  the  MAH  submitted  results  form 
biomarker analyses. With the exception of EGFR staining in study EMR 62 202-046, neither phase III 
study  had  other  biomarker  analyses  prospectively  planned  in  the  original  protocol.  However,  for 
exploratory  analyses,  substantial  efforts  were  made  to  collect,  retrospectively,  as  much  archived 
tumour tissue as possible from patients in the two studies.

The results of the analyses were discussed at the SAG meeting. The rationale governing the selection 
of  biomarkers  was  acknowledged,  but  the  problems  associated  with  low  percentages  of  samples  for 
analyses  were  also  emphasized.  Due  to  this  and  the  overall  low  add-on  activity  of  cetuximab  only 
major differential activity would be detected. The lead hypotheses based on external but not NSCLC 
related  data,  i.e.  that  KRAS  mutation  status  would  be  of  importance,  however,  can  reasonably  be 
regarded  as  refuted.  With  respect  to  KRAS,  similar  results  have  also  been  reported  for  erlotinib 
administered  after  chemotherapy  first  line  NSCLC,  i.e.  that  KRAS  mutations  seem  not  to  be 
associated with major loss in efficacy (study SATURN).  
Available  biomarker  data  have  been  presented  and  analysed  and  that  there  is  agreement  that  these 
analyses  provide  no  basis  for  selecting  patients  for  treatment  with  cetuximab.  In  case  of  a  positive 
opinion, the company’s plans to address this issue should be further detailed. It is obvious, however, 
that additional clinical studies are needed.

 Further subgroup analyses of Study EMR 62 202-046 (“FLEX”). 
Study EMR 62 202-046 (“FLEX”) was conducted worldwide. As today Asians are known to present 
with NSCLC biologically different from NSCLC in Caucasian, this study was further analysed.

The table above well illustrates the expected differences between “Asian” (Japan, China, Korea) and 
Caucasian patients. In Asian patients enrolled in this study, EGFR TK mutations are expected in about 
40% of the patients vs. about 10% in Caucasians. EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR TKI) were 
also more frequently used in Asians (61 vs. 17%).  
In Asians PFS was 0.88 in favour of cetuximab, while OS favoured the chemotherapy (CTX) only arm 
(1.18). This may relate to more frequent use of TKI in the CTX only arm (73% vs. 50%).  
Based on these findings it is considered reasonable to further analyse study outcome in Caucasians 
only.

While  being  reasonable,  the  outcome  in  Caucasians  still  refers  to  an  analysis  for  which  no  alpha 
spending was foreseen. The difference at the median tends to underestimate the treatment effect. Post 
study anti-cancer therapy is considered unlikely to contribute to observed difference in OS.

Pooled efficacy analysis 
In order to further confirm the robustness of the add-on efficacy and to receive a more precise estimate 
of the overall treatment effect of cetuximab to standard CTX a pooled efficacy analysis on raw data 
was  performed  based  on  the  4  randomized  clinical  studies  with  comparable  study  populations  and 
treatment regimens.

A high unmet medical need remains in the treatment of advanced or metastatic NSCLC, because only 
limited improvements in OS were achieved with new treatments, in particular in patients with NSCLC 
other  than  predominantly  adenocarcinoma.  Therefore,  the  MAH  has  analyzed  the  efficacy  of 
cetuximab  treatment  in  the  subgroups  of  NSCLC  patients  with  adenocarcinoma  and  with  non-
adenocarcinoma.

Safety Reanalysis  
In  order  to  evaluate  the  risk-benefit  of  cetuximab  in  patients  with  non-adenocarcinoma,  safety  data 
were  compared  between  the  non-adenocarcinoma  population  (N=1012)  and  the  safety  population 
(N=1970). The safety analyses presented here focus on a comparison of all AEs, grade 3/4 AEs, grade 
4  AEs,  SAEs,  AEs  of  particular  relevance  (special  AE  categories,  infectious  complications),  and 
deaths, in patients with non-adenocarcinoma and the safety population.  
Overall the safety profile of cetuximab in the non-adenocarcinoma population was comparable to the 
safety profile in the safety population. 
Comparison of AE frequencies (any grade, grade 3 and 4, grade 4 and serious AEs) 
An overview of frequencies of AEs, grade 3 and grade 4 AEs, grade 4 AEs, and SAEs, in the safety 
population  compared  to  the  non-adenocarcinoma  population  by  treatment  group  is  shown  in  the 
following table.

Key safety parameters remain unchanged in the non-adenocarcinoma histological subgroup compared 
to the overall safety population. 
The  difference  between  treatment  groups  in  terms  of  SAEs  (approx.  15 %),  grade  3/4  AEs  (approx. 
10 %), and grade 4 AEs (approx. 8 %) that was observed in the safety population remained unchanged 
in the non-adenocarcinoma population. These increases are attributable to side effects that are in line 
with the well-characterized safety profile of cetuximab and are manageable and did not result in more 
treatment-related deaths. 
It is agreed that the overall safety profile is unaffected by the underlying NSCLC histology. This is not 
too surprising. The difference between CTX and CTX+ cetuximab with respect to grade 4 events and 
SAEs is clearly non-trivial. 
Differences in SAEs and grade 4 AEs 
In all 4 studies, AEs were routinely analyzed from the first day of any study treatment administration 
until  30  days  (42  days  for  EMR  62202-011)  after  the  last  infusion  of  any  study  treatment.  As  a 
consequence the average observation period was longer for cetuximab + CTX compared to CTX alone 
due to subjects who continued on cetuximab therapy (median of 6 to11 weeks) after the end of CTX. 
Previous  analysis  on  any SAEs  and  grade  4  AEs  did  not  take  into  account  the  different  observation 
periods.  The  combined  frequencies  of  subjects  with  SAEs  and  grade  4  AEs  in  all  4  randomized 
controlled  studies  were  56.8%  (556/979)  and  48.6%  (476/979)  for  cetuximab  +  CTX  and  41.3% 
(409/991)  and  40.6%  (402/991)  for  CTX  alone  resulting  in  a  difference  of  15.5%  and  8.0%, 
respectively.

Assessing comparable observation periods reduced the difference between treatment arms from 15.5% 
to 10.9% in SAEs and form 8.0% to 5.6% in grade 4 AEs.  
The  increase  in  serious  adverse  events  in  the  cetuximab  arms  is  considered  non-trivial.  In  study 
62 202-046 at least one SAE was reported by 56% vs. 42% of the patients.

In terms of deaths (up to 30 days after the end of therapy) a higher rate was reported for the cetuximab 
+  CTX  group  which  can  be  explained  by  the  longer  observation  period.  When  standardizing  for 
similar  observation  periods  the  number  of  deaths  was  comparable  (12.9%  vs  11.6%).  Moreover 
treatment-related deaths were low and comparable between cetuximab + CTX and CTX alone (1.4% 
and 1.2%, respectively). As expected the SAEs and grade 4 AEs were in line with the well established 
safety  profile.  The  SAEs  and  grade  4  AEs  were  manageable  and  did  not  result  in  more  treatment-
related deaths.

Thromboembolic complications 
The  combined  analysis  of  all  4  studies  revealed  a  higher  frequency  of  grade  3  and  4  events  for 
cetuximab + CTX (6.8%; 67/979) compared to CTX alone (4.8%; 48/991). The most frequent events 
were  pulmonary  embolism  (3.4%;  33/979  for  cetuximab  +  CTX  and  2.3%;  23/991  for  CTX  alone); 
and  deep  vein  thrombosis  (2.2%;  22/979  in  the  cetuximab  +  CTX  group  and  1.5%;  15/991  for  the

Thromboembolic events are listed, but a 2% absolute increase is of clinical relevance.

NSCLC.  Recently,  however,  bevacizumab  was  licensed  as  add-on  therapy  in  patients  with  non-
squamous NSCLC.  
Large  confirmatory  studies  have  been  conducted  with  erlotinib  and  gefitinib  (EGFR  tyrosine  kinase 
inhibitors)  as  add-on  to  platinum  based  regimens  without  any  discernable  add-on  activity  in  an 
unselected population.

This submission refers to the use of cetuximab as add-on to standard platinum based doublets. In the 
largest  trial  (FLEX)  designed  to  demonstrate  a  survival  benefit  of  cetuximab  add-on,  a  small  (HR 
0.87)  but  borderline  significant  (p=0.044)  effect  was  shown.  Post  hoc,  an  analysis  excluding  Asians 
due  to  their  today  well  known  and  well  characterised  different  tumour  biology  on  a  group  level 
resulted in a p-value of 0.003. In a pooled analysis of all studies and including all patients the p-value 
was 0.010. 
Study  CA225099  was  designed  to  show  a  Progression-free  survival  (PFS)  benefit  and  was  the  only 
study  with  independent  verification  of  tumour  progression.  Based  on  independent  review  this  study 
failed  to  meet  its  objectives  (p=0.24),  but  results  were  statistically  significant  based  on  investigator 
data  and  in  a  post  hoc  time  to  treatment  failure  analysis.  None  of  the  other  studies  showed  a 
statistically significant effect. In a pooled analysis the results were borderline significant (0.036).  
An  increased  response  rate  has  been  convincingly  demonstrated  in  the  individual  studies,  including 
CA225099, i.e. the study with independent verification. 
The  documented  patient  benefit  in  terms  of  survival  is  small,  HR  0.88  corresponding  to  a  median 
benefit of 1+ months (pooled analysis). The most favourable results were those in Caucasians in the 
FLEX study (HR 0.80 corresponding to 2 months median benefit, estimated from the HR). Due to the 
uncertainties with respect to PFS as discussed above, PFS benefit is hard to estimate.   
A proposed restriction to patients with NSCLC with non-adenocarcinoma histology was discussed. In 
this subgroup, survival results are borderline better (HR 0.83 vs. 0.94) while PFS is very similar (HR 
0.89 vs. 0.90), i.e. non-convincing with respect to differential activity. However, there is no licensed 
product which has shown an add-on survival benefit to standard therapy in this group of patients.  
The tolerability/toxicity profile of cetuximab is considered relatively well characterised also as add-on 
to  various  chemotherapy  regimens.  Very  common  and  common  adverse  reactions  of  importance  for 
tolerability  encompass  skin  reactions,  diarrhoea,  mucositis,  nausea,  fatigue,  etc.  Less  common,  but 
severe  and  serious  reactions  include  neutropenic  fever  and  other  infectious  complications, 
thromboembolic  complications,  cardiac  events,  dehydration  and  severe  infusion  related  reactions 
which may be fatal.  
Despite  a  large  and  comprehensive  studies  programme  investigating  the  add-on  use  of  cetuximab  to 
standard platinum-based doublets in the first-line treatment of patients with NSCLC, the documented 
benefit is considered borderline and appears not to outweigh the risk.  
During the SAG oncology meeting, there was a split view among oncologists as to the magnitude of 
the clinical benefit. The field of treatment of NSCLC is characterised by small steps towards improved 
efficacy and moreover cetuximab exhibited add-on effects on survival in patients with tumours of non-
adenocarcinoma  histology.  The  documented  survival  benefit  is  undoubtedly  small,  but  the  risk 
associated  with  the  add-on  use  of  cetuximab  is  well  characterised,  i.e.  can  and  should  influence  the 
decision  whether  to  treat  or  not  an  individual  patient  with  cetuximab.  Unfortunately  biomarkers  or 
clinical characteristics (other than those generally applicable) cannot be used to guide this decision.   
Rash  (and  probably  diarrhoea)  is  a  very  common  and  often  disturbing  side  effect  of  cetuximab,  but 
associated  with  a  favourable  outcome.  As  it  is  an  on-treatment  effect,  it  cannot  be  stated  that  it  is 
predictive of benefit of therapy, but it is a good prognostic sign. This is of some importance for the 
individual patient on therapy experiencing these side effects. 
Incidence of grade 3/4 cardiac events on cetuximab treatment is increased in patients > 65 years with 
cardiac history in NSCLC patients. The issue should be further investigated across indications.   
In  conclusion,  in  the  presented  trials  the  estimated  benefit  of  add-on  cetuximab  to  standard 
chemotherapy in terms of survival is considered modest (HR 0.88) and statistically non-compelling in 
the  light  of  non-convincing  effects  in  terms  of  PFS.  Documented  benefits  are  not  considered  to 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
outweigh the tolerability and safety concerns, including an increased risk for grade 4 AE:s and SAE:s 
in studies CA225099 and EMR 62202-046.  
Despite  a  large  and  comprehensive  studies  programme  investigating  the  add-on  use  of  cetuximab  to 
standard platinum-based doublets in the first-line treatment of patients with NSCLC, the documented 
benefit is borderline statistically and clinically and does not outweigh the risks. 
Therefore, the Benefit – risk ratio of Erbitux in the indication of: 
“first-line  treatment  of  patients  with  epidermal  growth  factor  receptor  (EGFR)-expressing 
advanced  or  metastatic  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  in  combination  with  platinum-based 
chemotherapy” 
 is considered negative. 
Some members of the CHMP expressed a divergent position as follows: 
Although very modest in absolute terms, the effect on Overall survival is a very relevant effect in 
relative terms due to the short survival, and is similar to incremental improvement achieved with 
other agents in NSCLC. 
The lack of convincing supportive data in terms of PFS was considered not to be critical because 
the overall pattern was generally consistent with OS in terms of a favourable treatment effect. 
There is an unmet medical need particularly in patients with tumors of non-adenocarcinoma 
histology. 
The added toxicity was of some concern but it was considered manageable and in the overall 
balance did not outweigh the benefits in a condition where there are only few treatments with an 
effect on OS. 
3.  Re-Examination procedure 
The Applicant in response to CHMP negative opinion requested a re-examination on grounds of safety 
and efficacy as analysed below 
3. 1.  Grounds for re-examination – Safety aspects 
The  major  concern  of  the  CHMP  seemed  to  be  that  the  modest  benefit  of  erbitux  was  likely  to  be 
outweighed by the non-trivial side-effects of the treatment. 
The  CHMP  regarded  the  risk  associated  with  the  add-on  use  of  cetuximab  as  well  characterized. 
However,  the  CHMP  considered  the  documented  benefits  of  adding  cetuximab  to  platinum-based 
chemotherapy  not  to  outweigh  the  tolerability  and  safety  concerns,  including  an  increased  risk  for 
grade 4 AEs and SAEs. In addition it was noticed that the Kaplan-Meier survival curves, particularly 
for  study  EMR  62  202-046,  did  not  separate  during  the  first  6  months  of  treatment.  One  possible 
explanation was that early treatment benefit might be balanced by toxic deaths during the CTX phase. 
The MAH presented further analyses to support that the add-on toxicity of cetuximab when added to 
CTX  is  clearly  reduced  in  patients  <65  years  compared  to  patients  ≥65  years  and  compared  to  the 
overall safety population in NSCLC. Importantly, in patients <65 years the addition of cetuximab to 
CTX increased the rate of grade 4 AEs only by 3.8% compared to 14.7% in patients ≥65 years. This 
difference is also reflected in the rate of AEs leading to deaths: In patients <65 years with cetuximab + 
CTX the rate of AEs reported with outcome deaths was only marginally increased compared to CTX 
(0.4%)  whereas  in  patients  ≥65  years  this  rate  was  increased  by  9.9%.  The  same  trend  was  also 
observed for grade 3/4 toxicities and for SAEs (grade 3/4 AEs increase of 7.4% in patients <65 years 
vs. 13.7% in patients >65 years; SAEs increase of 13.1% in patients <65 years vs. 19.6% in patients 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
≥65 years). The improved safety profile of cetuximab in combination with CTX in patients <65years is 
also seen in the histological subgroup of non-adenocarcinoma NSCLC. In the population ≥65 years the 
most important finding was the increased incidence of cardiac events (grade 3/4, grade 4 and SAE) in 
the cetuximab + CTX group particularly in patients with cardiac history. Cardiac events accounted for 
about half of the additional AEs with reported outcome death in the cetuximab + CTX group.  
The  MAH  concluded  that  the  safety  profile  of  cetuximab  +  CTX  in  patients  <65  years  is  improved 
compared to the safety population. 
The Applicant has now made a considerable effort to document that the Erbitux has a more favourable 
safety profile in patients with NSCLC under the age of 65 years which is not surprising. According to 
the presented data the add-on therapy has been poorly tolerated in the elderly, more frail patients (with 
more  co-morbidities)  who  have  experienced  more  SAEs,  grade  3  and  4  toxicities  and  deaths  in  the 
pooled  safety  evaluation.  It  has  been  documented  that  the  effect  of  add-on  therapy  with  Erbitux  in 
patients aged ≥ 65 years is diluted by the higher risk of death due to AEs in this subpopulation.   
Importantly,  an  increased  incidence  of  cardiac  events  has  been  identified  in  the  cetuximab  +  CTX 
group  in  patients  aged  ≥  65  year,  particularly  in  high-risk  patients  with  a  cardiac  history.  It  is 
recommended  that  the  Applicant  should  undertake  an  investigation  of  this  safety  signal  in  all 
indications approved or under investigation.  
Interestingly, the Applicant has also explored the safety profile of Erbitux in the important subgroup of 
patients with non-adenocarcinoma, and the safety findings in this subpopulation seems consistent with 
the safety profile in the overall population and as such independent of the histological tumour subtype.   
Although these are post-hoc analyses, the study protocol for Erbitux in NSCLC pre-specified the two 
subpopulations  by  age  (<  or  ≥  65  years).  Furthermore,  the  Applicant  has  used  a  Cox  proportional 
hazard model with 3 age levels to support the use of 65 years as the most appropriate age cutpoint. 
The  difference  between  the  2  age  groups  is  that  for  those  ≥65  years  an  increased  number  of  deaths 
occurred within the first few months of the trial with multiple causes and about half being preceded by 
a  cardiac  AE.  These  early  deaths  affected  the  Kaplan-Meier  survival  curves  particularly  for  study 
EMR 62 202-046.  However, whether this observation was a chance finding or indeed reflects some 
add-on  toxicity  from  cetuximab,  needs  to  be  clarified  by  the  MAH  and  clarification  of  this  point  is 
central  to  the  validity  of  the  sub-group  analysis  in  support  of  an  improved  benefit:risk  balance  as  
proposed by the MAH for those <65 years and the need for further safety assessment of cetuximab in 
licensed indications for those   >65 years. 
3. 2  Grounds for re-examination – Efficacy aspects 
Results in Patients <65 Years 
In the pivotal study EMR 62 202-046 the OS benefit (primary endpoint) in the patient population <65 
years for cetuximab + CTX vs. CTX is seen early as the Kaplan-Maier curves separate from the start, 
with a median OS benefit of 1.5 months (see Figure 10). This difference in median OS (11.5 vs. 10.0 
months) was  greater compared to 1.2 months for the ITT population (11.3 vs. 10.1 months). The 1-
year  survival  rate  for  patients  <65  years  was  also  more  improved  compared  to  the  ITT  population 
(difference  of  7%  vs.  5.1%).  In  patients  <65  years  the  HR  for  OS  was  0.85  [95%  CI:  0.72-0.99; 
p=0.043] reflecting improvement in survival by 18% in the cetuximab + CTX group compared to the 
CTX group, which is also an improvement when compared to the ITT population (HR 0.87). 
33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The increased OS benefit for cetuximab + CTX is further confirmed in the pooled analysis including 
all  4  randomized,  controlled  studies  for  the  ITT  population  <65  years.  The  early  separation  of  the 
Kaplan-Meier curves is also observed for the pooled population. In contrast, in the study CA225099, 
the  improved  safety  in  patients  <65  years  does  not  translate  in  an  improvement  in  median  OS 
(secondary endpoint) and HR in patients <65 years. 
Efficacy results are summarized for the ITT population <65 years in Table 12. 
34 
 
 
 
 
Time to treatment failure 
More patients in the CTX group in study EMR 62 202-046 (ITT population) went off study without 
image  based  PD  and  were  therefore  censored  (18%  vs.  24%).  The  time  to  treatment  failure  was 
therefore  calculated  as  a  post-hoc  sensitivity  analysis,  also  taking  into  account  events  which  were 
considered  signs  of  clinical  progression  (non-image-proven  PD  and  start  of  any  new  anti-cancer 
treatment).  TTF  in  patients  <65  years  was  significantly  prolonged  favouring  the  cetuximab  +  CTX 
group (HR 0.83 [95% CI: 0.72-0.97], p=0.02, (see Table 12). TTF was also improved in CA225099 
and pooled analysis.  
Subgroup analyses 
The results of subgroup analyses of OS time in the ITT population <65 years (EMR 62 202-046) are 
summarized in Figure 11. 
The  forest  plot  demonstrates  that  the  addition  of  cetuximab  to  CTX  was  generally  associated  with 
benefit  over  CTX  alone  in  terms  of  OS  time  in  the  ITT  population  <65  years  but  not  for  the  Asian 
population (see Figure 11). This was further supported in the pooled analysis. Subgroup analyses of 
the treatment effect showed advantages in terms of OS favouring cetuximab + CTX compared to CTX 
in all histological subtypes. 
Caucasian patients <65 years 
In the overall ITT population the most favourable results were those for Caucasians in study EMR 62 
202-046 with a p-value of 0.003 (HR 0.8 corresponding to 2 months median benefit, calculated from 
the  HR).  In  this  context  the  CHMP  acknowledged  that  the  Asian  patients  are  different  due  to  their 
today well known and well characterized different tumor biology. Therefore the Caucasian population 
better  reflects  the  patients  treated  mainly  in  Europe  than  the  overall  ITT  population.  For  Caucasian 
patients <65 years the combination of cetuximab+CTX demonstrated a significant median OS benefit 
of 1.7 months (10.8 vs. 9.1 months, HR 0.76) in the pivotal study EMR 62 202-046. Calculating the 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
corresponding benefit to the HR of 0.76 [95% CI: 0.64-0.91] in this population the median OS benefit 
is 2.9 months.  
The Kaplan-Meier curve for Caucasian patients < 65 years is shown in Figure 12. 
Results for Non-Adenocarcinoma <65 years 
Recent  progress  has  been  made  in  particular  in  adenocarcinoma  in  the  treatment  of  advanced  or 
metastatic  NSCLC,  whereas  improvements  in  terms  of  survival  have  not  been  achieved  in  the  last 
decade  for  the  treatment  of  non-adenocarcinoma.  Therefore  a  high  unmet  medical  need  remains, 
especially in patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC other than adenocarcinoma. The increased 
benefit in NSCLC patients with non-adenocarcinoma histology was acknowledged by the CHMP, and 
it was pointed out that cetuximab is unique among licensed products as a treatment option for tumors 
of non-adenocarcinoma histology, with documented add-on effects on survival. Therefore, the sponsor 
has  analyzed  the  efficacy  of  cetuximab  treatment  in  the  subgroup  of  NSCLC  patients  with  non-
adenocarcinoma. In study EMR 62 202-046 the OS and PFS benefit for patients <65 years in the non-
adenocarcinoma histology with cetuximab + CTX was further improved (OS: HR: 0.74 [95% CI: 0.60-
0.93], PFS: HR: 0.79 [95% CI: 0.63-0.99]) when compared to the ITT population (see Figure 13). Of 
note, the OS curve separates early indicating an add-on benefit of cetuximab during the CTX phase.  
36 
 
 
 
 
 
For  the  non-adenocarcinoma  population  <65  years  the  pooled  analysis  as  well  as  the  other  studies 
support the results observed in study EMR 62 202-046 in terms of OS. 
Efficacy results are summarized for the non-adenocarcinoma population <65 years in Table 13. 
37 
 
 
 
 
 
Subgroup analysis 
The results of subgroup analyses of OS time in the non-adenocarcinoma population <65 years are 
summarized in Figure 14. 
OS benefits seen in patients with non-adenocarcinoma and age <65 years were consistent across 
subgroups supporting the main survival findings. 
Quality of Life 
Quality of life (QoL) was assessed in study EMR 62 202-046 by means of EORTC QLQC30 Global 
Health Status. The assessment concluded that no significant differences in the QoL score between the 
treatment groups was observed during the period of the first 6 months after randomization. 
In accordance with the safety and efficacy analyses performed in different subgroups, additional QoL 
analyses  were  performed  for  the  following  subgroups:  ITT;  age  <  65years;  age  ≥65years;  non-
adenocarcinoma and age < 65years. It was planned to also carry out an analysis on the subgroup: non-
adenocarcinoma and age ≥65 years. However, there were not sufficient subjects with QL data in this 
subgroup  to  perform  the  analysis.  The  analyses  were  performed  on  the  multi-item  scales  from  the 
EORTC QLQ-C30, (i.e. the global health status\QL scale, the functional scales: physical functioning, 
role  functioning,  emotional  functioning,  cognitive  functioning,  social  functioning,  three  symptom 
scales: fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain) and the Dyspnoea scale from the EORTC QLQ-LC13. 
Overall  in  patients  <65  years  the  treatment  differences  were  smaller  than  in  the  original  study, 
indicating less impact on all 3 scales at cycle 3 by cetuximab + CTX. The subset analyses suggested 
that the subset ≥65 years showed the largest differences between treatment groups in favour of CTX 
alone. In patients <65 years with non-adenocarcinoma the results were comparable to the total patient 
population <65 years.  
38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Efficacy Conclusions 
The primary endpoint OS shows a median of 1.5 months improvement. The most favourable results 
were those seen in the Caucasian patients with an OS HR of 0.76 corresponding to 2.9 months median 
benefit  estimated  from  the  HR  in  EMR  62  202-046.  Due  to  the  differences  in  Asian  patients,  the 
Caucasian population better reflects the patients treated mainly in Europe. While improved safety in 
patients <65 years does not translate in study CA225099 in an improvement in median OS and HR in 
patients  <65  years  the  Kaplan-Meier  curve  for  patients  <65  years  separate  early  supporting  the 
findings of study EMR 62 202-046. In the non-adenocarcinoma population <65 years the findings of 
study  CA225099  were  consistent  with  those  of  study  EMR  62  202-046.  Most  importantly  the  early 
separation of the Kaplan-Meier curves was consistent for overall survival in the pivotal study EMR 62 
202-046  and  the  supportive  study  CA225099  demonstrating  a  benefit  for  patients  <65  years  treated 
with  cetuximab  +  CTX  compared  to  CTX  alone  from  start  of  treatment  onwards  supporting  the 
concept of reducing early death in the cetuximab + CTX group. 
Post-hoc subgroup analyses were conducted with the  aim of improving the benefit-risk profile in an 
identified sub-population, primarily by reducing the number of early, serious adverse events which it 
is speculated had a detrimental effect on OS.  Post-hoc subgroup analyses should be interpreted with 
caution; in particular it is difficult to know whether a subgroup has been identified as having improved 
efficacy / safety because these patients genuinely respond better to treatment, or simply due to chance.  
In  any  clinical  trial  some  subgroups  will  artificially  appear  to  do  better  than  the  overall  patient 
population  due  to  chance  alone.    Key  considerations  as  to  whether  this  type  of  analysis  can  be 
accepted  include  the  biological  plausibility  of  finding  an  improved  response  in  the  subgroup  and 
consistency  of  the  evidence  of  the  improved  effect  across  the  different  sources  of  evidence  (trials) 
provided.    
Examining  the  OS  data  in  the  two  main  trials  for  trial  046,  those  <65  years  have  a  1.5  month 
difference  with  a  slightly  lower  HR  than  the  ITT.    For  trial  -099  the  OS  for  those  <65  years  is  0.5 
months (compared with 1.3 months for the ITT) with a larger HR than the ITT.  The PFS data for the 
<65 years group in each of the large controlled trails is less convincing than the PFS data for the ITT. 
The  proposition  made  by  the  MAH  is  that  based  on  the  subgroup  analysis  the  benefit:  risk  is  more 
favourable  for  patients  <65  years  due  to  less  early  deaths  in  the  trial  seen  in  those  ≥65  years.    It  is 
agreed that in those <65 years there are less early deaths, but overall the absolute % of SAE are similar 
between those <65 years and the total population. 
On  the  basis  of  the  above  analyses  the  Applicant  proposed  during  the  re-examination  to  modify  the 
indication as follows: 
“Erbitux is indicated in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of 
patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-expressing advanced or metastatic non-small 
cell  lung  cancer.  A  positive  risk-benefit  ratio  was  not  demonstrated  in  patients  65  years  of  age  or 
older (see section 4.4 and 5.1)”,  
It  is  proposed  that  the  SAG-Oncology  should  be  re-consulted  on  the  clinical  relevance/need  of 
treatment  of  Erbitux  in  patients  under  the  age  of  65  years  where  the  safety  profile  appears  more 
favourable. Given the finding of an increased incidence of cardiac events in patients aged ≥ 65 years 
of age, the Applicant should undertake an investigation of this safety signal in all indications approved 
or under investigation. 
Finally, the modest increase in OS in those <65 years was not reflected in PFS.     
Therefore  the  proposal  that  an  improved  benefit:  risk  in  those  <65  years  is  not  supported  from  the 
efficacy data.  With the exception of early deaths in those >65 years the overall incidence in SAEs was 
similar in those <65years to that seen in the initial ITT population.  Multiple sub-group analyses were 
performed which raises concern about the validity of conclusions drawn as the results in each trial and 
in the pooled analysis were not consistent.  
Therefore, the CHMP recommends that the SAG-Oncology should be re-consulted on the grounds for 
negative  opinion  in  view  of  the  grounds  for  re-examination  submitted,  in  particular  on  the  clinical 
39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
relevance  and  need  of  treatment  of  Erbitux  in  patients  under  the  age  of  65  years  where  the  safety 
profile is claimed to be more favourable.  
3. 3  Discussion at the SAG-Oncology 
The following questions were discussed at the SAG-O convened on the re-examination: 
1. What is the view of the SAG on the discordance between the PFS and OS results?  Are the data on 
OS considered reliable in light of the less favourable data on PFS? 
It  is  difficult  to  speculate  on  the  discordance  between  PFS  and  OS,  although  it  is  an  unexpected 
finding.  Concerning  the  importance  of  this  poor  correlation,  this  may  suggest  that  the  effect  on  OS 
could be due to treatment given after progression although this remains a hypothesis. The SAG agreed 
that  in  this  setting,  the  most  relevant  clinical  endpoints  to  balance  benefits  and  risks  are  OS  and 
toxicity,  and  some  members  argued  that  one  should  not  put  too  much  emphasis  on  the  presence  or 
absence of effect on PFS.  
2. What is the view of the SAG on the use of post-hoc subgroup analyses in this setting to substantiate 
a positive benefit: risk balance in NSCLC in those <65 years? 
In  general,  the  conclusions  from  post-hoc  subgroup  analyses  to  substantiate  the  main  claim  of  a 
positive benefit-risk profile cannot be considered as reliable to establish clinical efficacy or safety, or 
to formally establish the existence of interactions with treatment, due to multiplicity and the possibility 
of introducing bias. In this case, there is no established biological rationale for the chosen cut-off. If 
this hypothetic finding is considered worthy of further investigation it should be formally confirmed 
prospectively,  using  robust  methodology.  In  any  case,  even  in  the  proposed  subset  of  patients  <65 
years  old,  the  magnitude  of  the  effect  was  at  best  of  very  modest  clinical  significance,  although  it 
achieved early separation of the survival curves. It should be mentioned that in the subgroup analyses 
we observed no clinical response in Stage III patients (although few patients have been enrolled. 
3. What is the view of the SAG of the adverse event profile in patients <65 years compared to that in 
the original ITT population, including all patients regardless of age? 
The observed adverse event profile in the subgroup appeared to be slightly improved in the analyses 
presented. According to some SAG members, in lung cancer a survival advantage of about 6 weeks is 
meaningful, if we compare these data to other studies, and the effect is unlikely to be due to further 
lines  of  therapy.  Accordingly  some  SAG  members  concluded  that  in  the  patient  group  <  65  years, 
there was a positive benefit/risk balance.  
However,  most  of  the  SAG  members  agreed  that  due  to  the  post-hoc  methodology  employed  to 
address efficacy, it is difficult to draw formal conclusions about this subgroup. It would be of interest, 
however,  to  explore  the  interaction  between  age  and  cetuximab-associated  toxicity  in  other 
indications.  For  the  time  being,  even  assuming  that  the  slightly  improved  safety  profile  in  younger 
patients  is  real,  the  toxicity  remained  significant  although  manageable  and  compared  unfavourably 
against the very modest effect in terms of OS. 
4.  Does  the  SAG  consider  that  the  estimated  overall  survival  benefit  of  cetuximab  as  add-on  to 
standard chemotherapy in those <65 years represents adequate and statistically compelling evidence in 
view of the PFS data? 
The claimed OS advantage is now based on a post-hoc analysis. From a methodological point of view, 
this  level  of  evidence  is  far  from  compelling  and  in  any  case  insufficient  to  draw  any  conclusions 
about  the  efficacy  or  the  safety  in  the  subgroup.  Even  accepting  the  methodological  flaws,  the 
magnitude of the effect was at best of very modest clinical significance. 
A  minority  of  the  members  insisted  on  the  fact  that  although  modest,  the  effect  observed  with 
cetuximab was in the same order of magnitude of what has been observed with other active agents for 
the treatment of advanced NSCLC.

Issues addressed at the Oral Explanation and discussion on the benefit-risk ratio  
Due to progressive reduction of organ function and age-dependent co-morbidities affecting functional 
status,  general  health,  and  tumor  symptoms,  toxicity  to  anti-cancer  therapy  is  reported  to  be 
aggravated  in  patients  ≥65  years.  As  per  the  ICH  E7  (studies  in  support  of  special  populations: 
geriatrics)  guideline  and  in  line  with  current  practice,  the  clinical  study  protocols  for  cetuximab  in 
NSCLC defined two subpopulations by age, younger than 65 years and 65 years or older. Therefore, 
the Applicant performed additional safety analyses by age (younger patients, defined as <65 years and 
elderly patients, defined as ≥65 years), and consequentially also efficacy analyses by age, in order to 
re-assess the risk/benefit ratio of cetuximab in NSCLC. These analyses included an evaluation of the 
appropriateness of the use of 65 years as the cut-point. 
The  proposition  made  by  the  MAH  is  that  based  on  the  subgroup  analysis  the  benefit:  risk  is  more 
favourable for patients <65 years due to less early deaths early in the trial seen in those ≥65 years. 
It is agreed that in those <65 years there are less early deaths, but overall the absolute % of SAE are 
similar between those <65 years and the total population. 
It can be considered biologically plausible that a subgroup of these fragile elderly patients are at higher 
risk  of  experiencing  fatal  toxicities  related  to  treatment  containing  cetuximab,  thereby  shifting  the 
B/R-ratio in a negative direction in this subgroup of patients. In general, age is an important prognostic 
factor that is taken into consideration by medical oncologists and haematologists on a daily basis. It is 
a  well-known  fact  that  intensive  treatment  regimens  are  poorly  tolerated  in  elderly  populations  with 
numerous  co-morbidities  and  that  well-defined  age  limits  play  an  important  role  in  the  selection  of 
treatment options and in the planning of clinical trials for several malignancies, e.g. AML and multiple 
myeloma  (thalidomide  indicated  in  patients  ≥  65  years  of  age).  As  such  there  could  be  a  biological 
rationale behind an improved B/R-ratio in younger cetuximab-treated patients. Whether the threshold 
should be set at 65 years, could of course be debatable, but this decision was based on a pre-specified 
subdivision  of  the  study  population  in  the  protocol  and  a  post-hoc  analysis  of  age  as  a  continuous 
variable  vs.  outcome  showing  that  the  65  years  was  the  most  optimal  cut-off  point.  Based  on  the 
results  of  the  trial  this  cut-off  point  is  merely  considered  as  supportive  information  for  the  treating 
physicians. 
It  has  to  be  emphasized  however  that  post-hoc  subgroup  analyses  were  conducted  with  the  aim  of 
improving the benefit-risk profile in an identified sub-population, primarily by reducing the number of 
early, serious adverse events which it is speculated had a detrimental effect on OS.  Post-hoc subgroup 
analyses should be interpreted with caution; in particular it is difficult to know whether a subgroup has 
been identified as having improved efficacy / safety because these patients genuinely respond better to 
treatment, or simply due to chance.  In any clinical trial some subgroups will artificially appear to do 
better than the overall patient population due to chance alone.  Key considerations as to whether this 
type of analysis can be accepted include the biological plausibility of finding an improved response in 
the  subgroup  and  consistency  of  the  evidence  of  the  improved  effect  across  the  different  sources  of 
evidence (trials) provided.    
Examining  the  OS  data  in  the  two  main  trials  for  trial  046,  those  <65  years  have  a  1.5  month 
difference with a slightly lower HR than the ITT.  For trial -099 the OS (secondary endpoint) for those 
<65 years is 0.5 months (compared with 1.3 months for the ITT) with a larger HR than the ITT.  The 
PFS data for the <65 years group in each of the large controlled trails is less convincing than the PFS 
data for the ITT. 
The MAH during an Oral Explanation at the CHMP focused on the following issues: 
The proposed indication is based on a post hoc subgroup analysis that was not intended to be the basis 
for  confirmation  of  efficacy.  The  MAH  discussed  whether  this approach  is  statistically  robust 
considering the  biological  plausibility  of  the  hypotheses  on  which  the  proposal  is  based  and  the 
apparent  lack  of  consistency  of  effects  in  this  subgroup  in  the  two  pivotal  trials.  The  MAH 
also presented PFS curves for study 046 in Caucasian patients < and > 65 years of age.  
41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
It  is  of  particular  interest  to  seek  external  validation  of  the  hypothesis  that  age  and  smoking-related 
comorbidities  were  responsible  for  this  toxicity  in  other  indications.  Given  the  similarities  in  risk 
factors,  life-style  and  resulting  co-morbidities,  the  comparison  between  patients  with  NSCLC  and 
SCCHN (squamous cell cancer of the head and neck) was considered most pertinent for this purpose. 
The MAH elaborated on these data and submitted an overview of the absolute number of total deaths 
and  the  grade  3  and  4  events  in  patients  with  SCCHN.   The  applicant  provided  survival  curves  for 
patients < and > 65 years of age for the two randomised head and neck cancer studies.  
The estimated benefit of add-on cetuximab to standard chemotherapy in terms of survival in those <65 
years  is  considered  modest  (HR  0.86)  and  statistically  non-compelling and  is  not  considered  to 
outweigh the tolerability and safety concerns.  According to the subgroup analysis (both in the entire 
ITT population and in patients < 65 years of age) patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) seem 
to have the most benefit from add-on treatment with cetuximab. The excess toxicity in those >65 years 
was considered by the MAH to be related to co-morbidities in these subjects as a result of smoking. 
The MAH also discussed the benefit-risk ratio of cetuximab in the subgroup of patients with SCC who 
have a high unmet medical need considering that SCC of the lung is largely a disease of older patients 
with a history of smoking. 
Following the oral explanation, the CHMP concluded that: 
•  The magnitute of effect in terms of overall survival as estimated from post-hoc subgroup analyses 
is not consistent across trials and not supported by an improvement in progression-free survival. 
•  Even in a proposed subset of patients <65 years old, the effect seen is at best of very modest 
clinical significance and due to methodological concerns, multiplicity and the possibility of 
introducing bias, it cannot be considered as reliable to establish clinical efficacy or safety.  
•  The toxicity (rash, diarrhea) remained significant although well known and manageable and 
compared unfavourably against the very modest effect in terms of OS, therefore the CHMP 
considers that the benefit-risk profile in the indication: 
 Erbitux in combination with platinum -based chemotherapy for the first -line treatment of 
patients with epidermal-growth factor receptor (EGFR) -expressing advanced or metastatic 
non small cell lung cancer 
is negative and reconfirmed its initial negative opinion. 
A  minority  view  acknowledged  that  study  EMR  62  202-046  has  demonstrated  a  significant  overall 
survival benefit of 1.5 months as compared to what is usually seen in this setting, favoring the use of 
Erbitux as add-on therapy in patients with advanced, EGFR-expressing NSCLC.  
In view of the poor prognosis and the slow, but stepwise, improvement in survival benefit related to 
new therapies in NSCLC, a medium gain of 1.5 months in OS (primary endpoint) in the pivotal trial (-
046) in patients < 65 years of age is difficult to  disregard. A similar result was found in the pooled 
analysis of studies whereas no significant gain in OS (secondary endpoint) was found in study -099.  
In patients aged < 65 years of age, this benefit is even more evident. This observation is well-known 
and consistent among indications and due to well-known differences in tumor biology, the benefit was 
even more pronounced in Caucasians.  
In  further  support,  TTF  was  significantly  prolonged  and  there  were  indications  of  less  impact  on 
quality of life in patients <65 years favouring the cetuximab + CTX group. 
The inconsistencies noted in terms of PFS could be explained and nevertheless the overall survival is a 
harder and more important endpoint. 
The  clinical  benefit  is  of  more  importance  in  the  histological  subgroup  of  squamous  cell  carcinoma 
where there have been no recent developments and there is a high unmet medical need.

IV.  CONCLUSION 
On 19 November 2009 the CHMP considered the re-examination of this Type II variation and agreed 
that  the  changes  to  the  terms  of  the  Marketing  Authorisation  should  be  refused  on  the  following 
grounds: 
Whereas, 
•  The estimated magnitude of the treatment effect on overall survival is complicated by 
methodological concerns relating to retrospective subgroup analyses conducted to identify 
patients with a more favourable benefit-risk.  The effect on progression-free survival does not 
give strong support to the observed effect on overall survival. 
•  The effects on overall survival and progression-free survival are of modest clinical 
significance in the patient population proposed. 
•  The toxicity, although well known and manageable, is significant.  The estimated effect on 
overall survival is inadequate to offset this toxicity  
and therefore the CHMP considers that the benefit-risk profile of Erbitux in the indication 
"in combination with platinum -based chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients 
with epidermal-growth factor receptor (EGFR) -expressing advanced or metastatic non-small 
cell lung cancer" 
is negative, and reconfirmed its initial opinion of 23 July 2009.

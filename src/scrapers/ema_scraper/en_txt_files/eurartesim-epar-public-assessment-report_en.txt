2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Malaria remains a major cause of morbidity and death in endemic areas and substantial numbers of 
travellers from non-endemic areas are exposed to the risk of malaria each year.  
The most severe form of malaria, which is responsible for the great majority of malaria-related deaths 
(most of which occur in children aged < 5 years who reside in endemic areas), is associated with 
infection due to the species Plasmodium falciparum. Of the classical four Plasmodium species that 
infect man, P. falciparum has the shortest exo-erythrocytic phase (7-10 days) and the merozoites 
released after asexual reproduction of sporozoites in hepatic cells are able to invade erythrocytes at 
any stage of their development.  
Because of the relentless increase in resistance of P. falciparum to drugs such as chloroquine, 
sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine and mefloquine, new agents have had to be developed. The World Health 
Organization (WHO) has recommended that artemisinin combination treatment (ACT) should be 
regarded as the “policy standard” for treatment of malaria in areas where P. falciparum is the 
predominant infecting species. In developing ACT regimens the aim is to achieve rapid schizontocidal 
activity by means of the selected artemisinin compound together with a longer antimalarial effect 
associated with the different mechanism of action and longer half-life of the selected partner agent. 
Thus far the only medicinal product approved in the EU that would meet this requirement is a fixed 
combination of artemether and lumefantrine.  Another widely recommended treatment option in non-
endemic areas, such as EU, is the fixed combination of atovaquone and proguanil.  
Artemisinin and its derivatives 
A crude extract of the wormwood plant Artemisia annua (qinghao) was first used as an antipyretic 
2000 years ago in China and its specific effect on fever associated with malaria was reported in the 
16th century. The active constituent of the extract was identified and purified in the 1970s and named 
qinghaosu or artemisinin.  
Although artemisinin proved effective in clinical trials in the 1980s, a number of semi-synthetic 
derivatives were developed that had improvements in pharmacological properties, including 
pharmacokinetics and activity against malaria parasites. While the artemisinin derivatives are active 
per se against Plasmodia they undergo variable conversion to an active metabolite – 
dihydroartemisinin (DHA) - which preferentially accumulates in P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes. 
The bioavailability of dihydroartemisinin from oral artesunate has been estimated to be about 80%, 
whereas the bioavailability of artesunate itself is only 15%.  
The artemisinins are highly active against asexual forms of the four species of Plasmodium that infect 
humans with very rapid reductions in parasitaemia but relatively short plasma half-lives. There is also 
activity against the sexual forms (gametocytes) and therefore these agents have some potential to 
reduce transmission rates.

While the exact mechanism(s) of antimalarial activity of the artemisinins remains under investigation it 
is clear that the presence of endoperoxide moieties within the active forms of these molecules is an 
essential requisite for the antiparasitic effect. Evidence for this is provided by the lack of antimalarial 
activity of deoxyartemisinin, which is a derivative that lacks the endoperoxide bridge moiety. 
During the part of the life cycle of P. falciparum that occurs within human erythrocytes, the parasite 
uses haemoglobin as a food source. Haemoglobin is imported into acidic food vacuoles and broken 
down by proteolytic enzymes (plasmepsins) and cysteine proteases (falcipains) to amino acids. The 
process generates haem, which is detoxified by conversion to an insoluble compound known as malaria 
pigment or haemazoin. However, the haem also provides the ferrous iron that activates the 
endoperoxide bridge moiety in artemisinin molecules to form cytotoxic free radicals. Subsequently, 
covalent bonds are formed that alter the function of some essential parasite proteins such as 
membrane transporters. 
For many years experts in the field reported no apparent resistance of malaria parasites to the 
artemisinins. However, a study published in New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) (December 2008) 
reported that 2/60 patients who received artesunate alone to treat P. falciparum were classified as 
having artemisinin-resistant infection due to: 
  Re-emergence of parasitaemia between Day 21-28 
 
Prolonged parasite-clearance times (133 and 95 hours versus a median of 52.2 hours for patients 
who were cured) despite plasma drug concentrations after the first dose that were “adequate” (> 
mean for cured patients minus 1 SD) 
 
IC50 for DHA up to 4 times the geometric mean for cured patients and almost 10 times that for the 
reference clone W2. Resistance did not appear to be mediated by the number of copies of the P. 
falciparum multidrug resistance gene pfmdr1 or selected PfATPase6 polymorphisms. 
In July 2009 a Lancet article reported on reports of high failure rates associated with ACT in specific 
areas of Cambodia and Thailand. Clinical artemisinin resistance seems to have emerged along the 
Thai–Cambodian border from around 2005 onwards. Efforts are being made to try to prevent the 
spread of artemisinin-resistant strains outside of this region. Also in July 2009 an article was published 
in the NEJM on the issue of resistance to the artemisinins as observed in two open-label, randomised 
trials that compared oral artesunate 2 mg/kg for 7 days with a dose of 4 mg/kg for 3 days plus two 
doses of mefloquine (total 25 mg/kg) for treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Western 
Cambodia and in Northwest Thailand. Based on detailed study of 40 patients at each location, the 
median parasite clearance times were 84 h and 48 h in respective sites. Recrudescence (PCR-
confirmed) occurred in 6/20 (30%) receiving artesunate monotherapy and 1/20 (5%) receiving 
artesunate–mefloquine in Cambodia compared with 2/20 (10%) and 1/20 (5%) in Thailand.  
The differences were not explained by age, artesunate or DHA PK, in-vitro sensitivity tests or putative 
molecular correlates of P. falciparum drug resistance (relating to the PfMDR1 or PfSERCA genes). It 
was concluded that P. falciparum has reduced in-vivo susceptibility to artesunate in Western Cambodia 
compared with Northwest Thailand that results in slow parasite clearance. 
The most common adverse effects associated with the various orally-administered artemisinin 
derivatives are nausea, vomiting, bowel disturbance, abdominal pain, headache and dizziness. Mild and 
reversible haematological and electrocardiographic abnormalities, such as neutropenia and 1st-degree 
heart block, may be observed infrequently. Neurotoxicity, principally in the form of brainstem lesions, 
was first identified in animals receiving high doses over long periods. Neurological side-effects such as 
ataxia, slurred speech and hearing loss have also been reported in a small numbers of humans.

Piperaquine 
Piperaquine (PQ) was synthesised by the Shanghai Pharmaceutical Research Institute in the 1960s and 
later developed in France by Rhone-Poulenc in the 1970s. Piperaquine replaced chloroquine as the 
recommended treatment for P. falciparum malaria in China in 1978 and was used extensively for mass 
prophylaxis and treatment. 
PQ is an orally active bisquinoline that is structurally related to chloroquine. It is a highly lipophilic 
molecule that is practically insoluble in water while the tetraphosphate salt (PQP) is soluble in hot 
water. 
PQ is slowly absorbed (probably due to its high lipophilicity). It has a large volume of distribution at 
steady state relative to its bioavailability and a long plasma half-life. Clearance is markedly more rapid 
in children than in adults, reflecting the higher rates of hepatic metabolism and/or biliary excretion in 
children. The long half-life and large molecular size/weight suggest that PQ may undergo enterohepatic 
recycling.  
PQ has a similar mechanism of action as chloroquine that involves inhibition of haem detoxification by 
the parasite. There have been several reports of low rates of cross-resistance between chloroquine and 
piperaquine. Nevertheless, high rates of resistance to piperaquine have been reported from areas 
where it has been used alone, especially in China. 
About the product 
The development of Eurartesim builds on the available experience with Artekin (and the paediatric 
size tablets named Eurartekin). Both are provided as fixed dose combination (FDC) film-coated 
tablets of DHA and PQP. Artekin was first approved in China and has subsequently been studied and 
approved for use in several countries in SE Asia where multi-drug resistant P. falciparum infections are 
common. The manufacture of Eurartesim is not identical to that for Artekin but the applicant has 
proposed that the two are sufficiently similar that pharmacokinetic, safety and efficacy data generated 
with the one formulation can be extrapolated to the other. It should be noted that in-vitro data suggest 
that co-exposure of P. falciparum to DHA and PQ results in a similar phenomenon of inhibition of DHA 
accumulation in erythrocytes as seen with chloroquine. It has also been suggested that DHA could 
inhibit uptake of PQ. However, these in-vitro observations do not necessarily predict what might occur 
in the infected patient at clinical doses. 
Proposed indication (from the applicant): 
Eurartesim is indicated for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in adults, 
children and infants 6 months and over and weighing 5 kg or more. 
Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antimalarial agents. 
Proposed posology and method of administration (from the applicant): 
Posology 
Eurartesim should be administered over three consecutive days for a total of three doses taken at the 
same time each day.

There are no data on which to base a dose recommendation in patients 
weighing >100kg. 
For patients unable to swallow the tablets, such as infants and young children, Eurartesim may be 
crushed and mixed with water. The mixture should be used immediately after preparation. 
If a patient vomits within 30 minutes of taking Eurartesim, the whole dose should be re-administered; 
if a patient vomits within 30-60 minutes, half the dose should be re-administered. Re-dosing with 
Eurartesim should not be attempted more than once. If the second dose is vomited alternative 
antimalarial therapy should be instituted.  
If a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as realised and then the recommended regimen 
continued until the full course of treatment has been completed.  
There are no data on a second course of treatment.  
No more than two courses of Eurartesim may be given within a 12 month period (see sections 4.4 and 
5.3).  
A second course of Eurartesim should not be given within 2 months after the first course due to the 
long elimination half-life of piperaquine (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).  
Hepatic and renal impairment  
Eurartesim has not been evaluated in subjects with moderate or severe renal or hepatic insufficiency. 
Therefore, caution is advised when administering Eurartesim to these patients (see section 4.4). 
Elderly 
Clinical studies of Eurartesim tablets did not include patients aged 65 years and over,  therefore no 
dosing recommendation can be made.  Considering the possibility of age-associated decrease in liver 
and fuction, as well as a potential for heart disorders (see sections 4.3 and 4.4), caution should be 
exercised when administering the product to the elderly

Paediatric population 
See posology table above. 
The safety and efficacy of Eurartesim in children aged less than 6 months and in children weighing less 
than 5kg has not been evaluated. No data are available for these paediatric subsets. 
Method of administration 
Eurartesim should be taken orally with water and without food. Each dose should be taken no less than 
3 hours after the last food intake.  No food should be taken within 3 hours after each dose.

Manufacture 
Dihydroartemisinin (DHA) is a semisynthetic compound obtained by reduction of artemisinin extracted 
from the leaves of Artemisia annua L followed by purification and blending. The manufacturing process 
has been adequately described. Critical parameters have been identified and adequate in-process 
controls included. Specifications for starting materials, reagents, catalysts and solvents have been 
provided. Adequate control of critical steps and intermediates has been presented.  The purified active 
substance is packed in an inner and outer low density polyethylene (LDPE) bag. Both bags are closed 
with a plastic fastener. The bags are inserted into a high density polyethylene (HDPE) drum, which is 
closed with a lid equipped with a rubber gasket.  
Structure elucidation has been performed by infrared spectroscopy, ultraviolet spectroscopy, 1H NMR 
spectroscopy, 13C NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. The solid state characteristics were 
determined by FT-IR, XRPD, 1H NMR spectroscopy and optical microscopy. 
Specification 
The active substance (DHA) specification includes tests for physical appearance, identification (IR and 
HPLC), water content (Karl Fischer), specific rotation (polarimetry), heavy metals (Ph.Eur.), sulphated 
ash (Ph.Eur.), residual solvents (GC), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), particle size distribution  and 
microbiological limit tests (Ph.Eur.). It was noted that all specifications reflect the relevant quality 
attributes of the active substance. A detailed description for all analytical methods was provided. Full 
method validation data was provided for the in-house analytical methods and are in accordance with 
the relevant ICH guidelines.  In general analytical methods proposed are suitable to control the quality 
of the active substance. Impurities have been extensively described, classified as process related 
impurities and possible degradation products, and qualified with reference to toxicological studies.  
Data on five production scale batches of DHA have been provided and the requirements in the active 
substance specification were met. 
Stability 
The stability results of clinical batches confirmed the thermal sensitivity of DHA. In this context, the 
long-term stability studies with commercial batches were conducted at 5°C ± 3°C. 
The stability results from long-term (5°C ± 3°C.) and accelerated studies (25°C ± 2°C /60 ± 5%RH) 
were completed according to ICH guidelines . The following parameters were monitored during the 
stability studies: appearance, water content, specific rotation, assay and related substances. Forced 
degradation studies and photostability studies were conducted and it was noted that DHA is thermal, 
photo and chemical stress sensitive. The results of the long-term studies fulfil the proposed 
specification and for that reason support the proposed retest period when the active substance is 
stored in the original packing material and stored under refrigeration at 5°C ± 3°C prior to 
manufacture of the finished product. 
Piperaquine tetraphosphate (PQP) 
Its chemical name is 4,4'-(propane-1,3-diyldipiperazine-4,1-diyl)bis(7-chloroquinoline) tetrakis 
(phosphate) according to the IUPAC nomenclature. PQP is an off-white or pale yellow crystalline 
powder. This active substance is slightly soluble in water and practically insoluble in ethanol, methanol, 
glycerol, THF, acetonitrile and dichloromethane. This active substance has no chiral centres.

Manufacture 
The chemical synthesis of this active substance (PQP) takes place in three steps followed by 
purification (recrystallisation). The manufacturing process has been adequately described. Critical 
parameters have been identified and adequate in-process controls included. Specifications for starting 
materials, reagents, catalysts and solvents have been provided. Adequate control of critical steps and 
intermediates has been presented.  The purified active substance is packed in an inner and outer low 
density polyethylene (LDPE) bag. Both bags are closed with a plastic fastener. The bags are inserted 
into a high density polyethylene (HDPE) drum, which is closed with a lid equipped with a rubber 
gasket. Structure elucidation has been performed by infrared spectroscopy, ultraviolet spectroscopy, 
1H NMR spectroscopy, 13C NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, X-ray powder diffraction and ESI(+) 
mass spectroscopy. The results of the elemental analysis are consistent with the proposed molecular 
formula. 
Specification 
The active substance (PQP) specification includes tests for appearance, identification (IR and HPLC), 
water content (Karl Fischer), phosphate (Ph.Eur.), heavy metals (Ph.Eur.), pH (potentiometry Ph.Eur.), 
residual solvents (GC), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC, LC-MS), particle size distribution  and 
microbiological limit tests (Ph.Eur.). It was noted that all specifications reflect the relevant quality 
attributes of the active substance. A detailed description for all analytical methods was provided. Full 
method validation data was provided for the in-house analytical methods and are in accordance with 
the relevant ICH Guidelines.  In general analytical methods proposed are suitable to control the quality 
of the active substance. Impurities have been extensively described, classified as process related 
impurities and possible degradation products, and qualified with reference to toxicological studies.  
Data for one production scale batch and five small scale batches of PQP have been provided and the 
requirements in the active substance specification were met. 
Stability 
Forced degradation studies were performed exposing active substance samples to acidic, alkaline, 
oxidising conditions; thermal stress on solid sample, aqueous solution at 90°C, humidity and 
photostability (exposure to visible and UV light).  According to the results PQP is stable under alkaline 
conditions and resistant to thermal stress and humidity. Under acidic conditions, a decrease in assay 
was noted; several unknown impurities formed together with the known hydrolysis products and other 
known and unknown impurities. Under oxidising conditions PQP degraded. Some known hydrolysis 
products and other known impurities were observed when PQP is in aqueous solution at 90°C for 5 
hours. Exposure of PQP to light results in coloration of the powder. However, no substantial changes in 
the assay of PQP and its related substances could be observed.

The stability results from long-term (25°C ± 2°C /60% ± 5%RH) intermediate (30°C± 2°C /65% ± 
5%RH),  and accelerated studies (40°C± 2°C /75% ± 5%RH) for one clinical trial batch were 
completed according to ICH guidelines demonstrated adequate stability of the active substance. There 
was a need to change the manufacturing process several times since the manufacturing process was 
transferred to a new site. Therefore, three different stability studies were conducted, according to ICH 
guidelines, using 3 different batches for each stability study. The stability results from long-term 
(30°C± 2°C /65% ± 5%RH) and accelerated studies (40°C± 2°C /75% ± 5%RH) were completed 
according to ICH guidelines and demonstrated adequate stability of the active substance. Based on the 
stability data, it can be concluded that the active substance is stable when stored in the original 
packing material. The results support the agreed re-test period without specific storage conditions. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product  
Pharmaceutical Development 
All information regarding the choice of active substances and the excipients are sufficiently justified.  
The development of Eurartesim film-coated tablets was based on the formulation and dosage form 
developed for the Chinese market. The excipients selected for this formulation are commonly used in 
pharmaceutical formulations. The Applicant decided to develop two strengths of Eurartesim film-coated 
tablets (piperaquine tetraphosphate (PQP) and dihydroartemisinin (DHA) in the strength combination 
of 320 mg/40 mg and 160 mg/20 mg). One pilot batch per strength for clinical trials was manufactured 
from the same compression mixture. Later on in the development phase one additional tablet strength, 
specific for the infant population corresponding to half paediatric strength 80 mg/10 mg was 
considered. This third presentation has the same qualitative composition as the other tablets and 
allows an improvement in the administration compliance and dispensing as well as a lower variability of 
dosage. However, this strength was not authorised since there is no clinical and safety data available 
for target paediatric subsets (< 6 months and in children weighing <5kg). It was noted that the film-
coating was changed during the pharmaceutical development. However, it was verified that the film-
coating does not have an impact on the physical properties of tablets or on their dissolution profile. In 
other words, this change does not have an impact on the formulation quality or performance. 
Manufacture of the product 
The proposed commercial manufacturing process involves standard technology and it is divided into 7 
main steps: wet granulation, drying phase, sizing/sieving, final mixing, tabletting, coating and 
packaging. 
Furthermore, the equipment used is commonly available in the pharmaceutical industry. The critical 
steps in the manufacturing process have been identified and controlled. 
The manufacturing process has been adequately validated for three commercial batches and the 
results of the manufacturing validation reports were considered satisfactory. 
Product specification 
The product specification is standard for tablets and contains tests with suitable limits for appearance, 
identification (HPLC, UV, colorimetric), identification titanium dioxide, assay of PQP (HPLC), assay of 
DHA (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), PQP uniformity of dosage (Ph.Eur), DHA uniformity of dosage (Ph.Eur),

water content (Karl Fischer), PQP dissolution, DHA dissolution, average mass, residual ethanol (GC), 
microbial contamination (Ph.Eur). 
Impurities and degradation products have been evaluated and found to be acceptable from the point of 
view of safety. Their limits are justified by reference to stability studies. 
All analytical procedures that were used for testing the finished product were properly described. 
Moreover, all relevant methods were satisfactorily validated in accordance with the relevant ICH 
guidelines.  
The batch analysis results show that the medicinal product can be manufactured reproducibly and in 
accordance with the agreed finished product specifications. 
Stability of the product 
A stability study was conducted an early stage of pharmaceutical development on the clinical batches 
of Eurartesim for two initial strengths (i.e. adult - 320 mg/40 mg and paediatric - 160 mg/20 mg) 
packaged in the material proposed for marketing. The stability studies were conducted under long term 
conditions (25°C±2°C/60%±5%RH), intermediate conditions (30°C±2°C/ 65%±5%RH) and 
accelerated conditions (40°C±2°C/ 75%±5%RH) under ICH conditions. The following parameters were 
investigated: appearance, assay PQP and DHA, impurities, disintegration test, microbial limits. The 
results the stability studies fulfil the proposed specification. Once the final formulation was defined, 
more stability studies were conducted on three different batches for each of the Eurartesim strengths. 
In this context, stability studies were conducted under long-term conditions (25°C±2°C/60%±5%RH), 
intermediate conditions (30°C±2°C/ 65%±5%RH) and accelerated conditions (40°C±2°C/ 
75%±5%RH) under ICH conditions relevant to Climatic Zones I and II. It was noted that all the 
stability batches were packed in the same material intended for marketing of the finished product. 
Results of the stability studies are within specifications for long-term conditions 
(25°C±2°C/60%±5%RH) and intermediate conditions (30°C±2°C/ 65%±5%RH). 
It was noted that a forced degradation study has also been conducted on one batch per strength of the 
finished product (high temperature and relative humidity). The results of a thermal stress stability 
study confirm that DHA is sensitive to temperature when it is combined with PQP. One batch per 
strength was stored under ICH photostability conditions and no significant changes were observed. It 
can be concluded that the finished product is not affected by exposure to light. Based on the available 
stability data relevant to ICH Climatic Zones I & II, the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as 
stated in the SmPC are considered to be acceptable when the medicinal product is stored and used 
within the EU.  
In accordance with current EU data requirements no stability studies have been provided under (WHO) 
Climatic Zones III & IV. Therefore, if the medicinal product is stored and used outside the EU, or in any 
country where the climatic conditions are not represented by ICH climatic zones I & II, it cannot be 
assumed that the above-mentioned shelf life and storage conditions will apply. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Quality Development 
The pharmaceutical development of the formulation, the manufacturing process, control of the active 
substances and the finished product have been presented in a satisfactory manner and justified in 
accordance with relevant CHMP and ICH guidelines. The manufacturing flow-chart was provided with 
Assessment Report  
EMA/739355/2011

suitable in-process controls. The manufacturing process is adequately validated for three commercial 
batches at the proposed manufacturing site. The routine specifications and tests methods proposed for 
the finished product will adequately control the quality of the finished product. Analytical methods were 
well described and validated in agreement with relevant guidelines.  
Batch analyses were presented and the results showed that the finished product meets the 
specifications proposed.  
The container-closure system was found to be suitable to ensure the quality of the finished product as 
shown by the stability data.  
The conditions used in the stability studies comply with the ICH stability guideline (climatic zones I and 
II). The control tests and specifications for the finished product were adequately established. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished products 
have been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate satisfactory 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the 
conclusion that the medicinal product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic 
when stored and used within the EU. At the time of the CHMP opinion, all quality issues have been 
resolved. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The majority of the studies conducted were performed in accordance with GLP. The following were not 
conducted in accordance with GLP: 4 out of 14 of the pharmacokinetic studies; the hERG assay; the 2-
week repeated dose toxicity study in the rat; the single dose toxicity studies for qualification of the 
DKA and DOA degradation products. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
In the treatment of malaria, both DHA and PQP have well established clinical therapeutic usage as does 
the combination of both compounds (DHA/PQP). As such additional specific non-clinical pharmacology 
studies were not deemed necessary for Eurartesim. The pharmacological data for DHA, PQP and the 
DHA/PQP combination are provided from the available literature. 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
DHA is the active metabolite of artesunate and artemether, which are both artemisinin-derived anti-
malarial drugs. Typical of artemisinins, DHA has a very short plasma half-life of approximately 1 hour, 
and therefore, its use as monotherapy requires a multiple dosing regimen of seven days duration.  
PQ is structurally related to chloroquine with a similar mechanism of action through the chemical 
inhibition of parasite haem detoxification.  PQ is reported to have a very prolonged half-life (20-22 
days in humans), and hence facilitates a shorter treatment regimen.  
Assessment Report  
EMA/739355/2011  
Page 18/129
 
 
 
 
Eurartesim has been developed combining two drugs with different complimentary half-lives, one short 
and one long allowing a dosing regimen of 3 days duration while avoiding the recrudescence normally 
associated with short-course therapy. In addition DHA is stated to be rapidly effective against 95% of 
the parasite population leaving the PQP with only a few parasites with a very low risk of resistance to 
eliminate, thus reducing the emergence of Eurartesim resistant strains.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No non clinical studies providing data on secondary or general pharmacology of the DHA/PQP 
combination product were conducted. This is considered to be acceptable in view of the clinical 
experience of the two compounds as well as their combination. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
DHA - Potential Neurotoxicity  
The potential for neurotoxicity has been well documented. In animals, neurotoxicity is related to the 
dose, the route of administration and the pharmacokinetic properties of the different DHA pro-drugs. 
Sustained CNS exposure from slowly absorbed or eliminated artemisinins is considerably more 
neurotoxic than intermittent brief exposure. Thus, the oil-based intramuscular (IM) artemether and 
arteether appear more neurotoxic than those given orally. 
Two reviews on artemisinin derivative neurotoxicity concluded that the prolonged presence of 
artemisinins from the oil-based, intramuscular formulations was the main cause of the observed 
neurotoxicity in laboratory animals. Other neurotoxic factors were the high doses of artemisinin 
compounds used in animal studies and the different pharmacokinetic profiles following different routes 
of administration.  
The potential neurotoxicity in man of orally administered DHA, (the active metabolite of the majority of 
atemisinin derivatives) was concluded to be highly unlikely given the rapid clearance of DHA and the 
short exposure (3 days of treatment).  These conclusions are also consistent with those of the WHO 
Informal Consultation on Clinical Neurological Investigations Required for Patients Treated with 
Artemisinin Compounds and Derivatives 1998.

DHA- QT Prolongation  
In studies with artemether and arteether ECG effects have been noted: prolongation of QTc and 
changes on ECG with bizarre ST-T segment changes in rats and dogs administered artemether. Further 
studies in rat (12.5-50mg/kg/day for 28 days) confirmed ECG changes. Both IM and PO exposure to 
artemether at high dose levels was associated with a prolongation of mean QT interval of ECG in dogs. 
In dogs given 50mg/kg/day of artesunate, by IV route, for 14 days, no ECG changes were observed.  
The applicant states that cardiovascular sinus bradycardia and a reversible prolongation of the QT 
interval have been reported (Meyler’s Side Effects of Drugs; SEDA-21, 293) with artesunate. The 
applicant further states that in WHO monographs such adverse effects from extensive clinical trials 
were not reported.  
PQP Cardiovascular Effects  
In a recent publication it was reported that in rabbits, acute cardiovascular toxicity of PQP was 
compared with that of chloroquine by determining the cumulative intravenous dose that caused a fall 
in blood pressure, or electrocardiographic abnormalities. Using this determination, it was observed 
that, in general, PQP had a better cardiovascular toxicity profile than chloroquine. 
A hERG study was carried out for PQ as part of the investigation into the QTc prolongation potential of 
PQ.  This is to support the extensive analyses performed in the clinical studies. This study (0083-2009) 
was carried out by Sigma-tau to assess the effect of the antimalarial drugs chloroquine (CQ), PQ and 
mefloquine (MQ) on hERG tail current. Exposure to CQ, PQ and MQ reduced hERG residual tail current 
in a dose related manner and the dose response curves for the test items gave IC values of 5.28, 4.03 
and 19.88μM, respectively. All the test items decreased IKr in a dose related manner; CQ and PQ had 
nearly identical hERG IC50 values, suggesting a similar potential interference on cardiac repolarization.  
DHA/PQP  
As a result of the above data from literature, the applicant states that the cardiovascular (CVS) and 
central nervous system (CNS) effects have been specially monitored in the clinical trials.  
Targeted CNS exploration during the clinical trials was stated not to reveal any abnormalities.  
An evaluation of the torsadogenic risk of DHA and PQP in response to a question during assessment of 
the dossier revealed that although there was such a risk, it was lower than for CQ and halofantrine and 
in the same range as for MQ and lumefantrine. The torsadogenic risk indices of anti-malarial drugs 
were evaluated as ratios between IC50 values obtained in the hERG study and the free therapeutic 
plasma concentrations (FTPC) in patient studies, higher risk being associated with lower ratio value. 
For this ratio, the IC50 values derive from the study at 37°C (Zenas/Craven AS 2009-1).  
For comparison, additional antimalarial drugs were evaluated in the hERG assay by Zenas/Craven (AS 
2009-1), as reported in Table hereafter.

The risk that DHA and PQP might induce Torsade de Pointes arrhythmias exists, but according to this 
analysis the ratios for DHA and PQP are higher or in the same range than those for the other 
antimalarial compounds tested (chloroquine, mefloquine and lumefantrine). 
Also, the association of DHA and PQP did not produce hERG inhibition greater than that of the single 
compounds. 
According to ICH S7B guidelines, cardiovascular safety was assessed by using the hERG assay. No 
indication of particular cardiovascular problems related to QT prolongations was evidenced after 
Eurartesim administration during the dog toxicity studies (see further- repeat toxicity studies). 
In human subjects, QT prolongation was reported after DHA plus PQP administration (Karunajeewa et 
al., 2003;  Mytton et al., 2007). 
The applicant’s conclusion from the electrophysiology findings was that DHA/PQP does not cause 
clinically relevant cardiotoxicity.  The QTc prolongation observed was stated to be comparable with that 
observed with other antimalarials, including drugs with no known cardiac effects, which suggests that 
QT prolongation may have resulted from recovery from malaria and be unrelated to drug treatment.  
However, the issue of the effect of DHA/PQP on QTc prolongation and the risk of cardiac arrhythmias 
required further exploration. The CHMP requested additional non-clinical in-vitro experiments to further 
elucidate: 
 
 
The arrhythmogenic and torsadogenic potential of Eurartesim 
The underlying mechanisms of the observed QT prolongation and 
  Whether a pharmacodynamic interaction exists between PQP and DHA. 
The applicant submitted the following four studies: 
 
Trafficking of hERG channels 
  Effects on cardiac IKs current 
  Effects on cardiac INa current 
 
Isolated perfused rabbit left ventricular preparation 
In addition the applicant submitted 12 references from the published literature and an expert 
overview.

Block of hERG currents does not seem to be primarily responsible for the marked QT interval 
prolongation observed in humans after administration of Eurartesim.  
An inhibition of the trafficking of hERG channels by drugs has recently been identified as an important 
mechanism for several torsadogenic drugs, but both DHA and PQP at clinically relevant concentrations 
were shown to have no effects on hERG channel trafficking in HEK 293 cells.  
A block of the cardiac slow delayed rectifier K+ current (IKs) may also be ruled out as a mechanism for 
the marked QT interval prolongation induced by Eurartesim, since neither DHA, PQP nor the 
combination of both had marked effects on IKs in isolated human atrial myocytes. Also, for 
artemether/lumefantrine and chloroquine no such effect was observed. 
A protective mechanism against the induction of TdP arrhythmias resulting from the block of cardiac 
INa can be excluded, since neither DHA, PQP nor the combination of both had effects on peak INa
isolated human atrial myocytes. Such an effect was neither observed for the combination of 
 in 
artemether/lumefantrine , However, chloroquine (10 µM) blocked cardiac I
Na by about 43%. 
In the isolated perfused rabbit left ventricular preparation, DHA did not shown any torsadogenic 
effects, but shortened the QT interval and Tp-e (an index of transmural dispersion of repolarisation and 
proarrhythmias including early afterdepolarisation) at high concentrations of 30 and 100 µM (which 
may indicate some protective effects against the induction of TdP arrhythmias). In contrast, PQP 
concentration-dependently increased APD 90, QT interval and Tp-e at clinically relevant nanomolar 
concentrations and increased the TdP score at 3 µM. However, PQP did not induce early after-
depolarisations [EADs], an important surrogate parameter for the induction of Torsades de Pointes 
[TdP] arrhythmias) even at a high concentration of 3 µM, about 1,000-fold higher when compared to 
therapeutically effective free plasma concentrations of PQP. Similar effects on electrophysiological 
parameters to those of PQP alone were obtained when PQP was combined with a low concentration 
(2.4 µM) of DHA, but the effects of PQP on these parameters were less when combined with DHA at 
concentrations much higher than those achieved in humans (7.2 µM). These observations indicate that 
PQP has a torsadogenic potential, which is lower than that of chloroquine but higher than that of 
artemether/lumefantrine.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No non-clinical data relating to pharmacodynamic drug interactions were obtained.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of both DHA and PQP are detailed in the literature. In addition, in-house studies 
were performed by Sigma-tau to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of piperaquine (PQ) after single 
and repeated administration of DHA/PQP in rats and dogs. The systemic exposure to PQ in rats in dogs 
was assessed during 4-week toxicity studies. Absorption-distribution-metabolism-excretion (ADME) 
and protein binding studies in rats were also performed using [14C]-PQP (co-administered with DHA).  
In toxicology and pharmacokinetic studies, analyses of PQ in rat and dog plasma and DHA in dog 
plasma were carried out using validated HPLC-MS/MS methods. However, due to the instability of DHA 
in dog plasma during freeze-thaw cycles, the DHA toxicokinetics in dogs were not assessed.  
In single-dose testing in male rats, systemic exposure following a single oral administration of 
DHA/PQP at the dose of 270mg/kg (30mg/kg of DHA and 240mg/kg of PQP) using three different 
formulations revealed that the PQ pharmacokinetics were characterised by a slow absorption and

elimination rate; the maximum plasma concentration was reached about 8 to 13 hours after treatment, 
and the apparent elimination half-life was ~ 200 hours for each formulation.  
In the 5 day oral pharmacokinetic study in Beagle dogs, in which DHA/PQP was given by the oral route 
at 22.5mg/kg/day (2.5mg/kg of DHA and 20mg/kg of PQP), 45mg/kg/day (5mg/kg of DHA and 
40mg/kg of PQP) in 5% methocel, the daily systemic exposure to PQ increased substantially after both 
dose levels in direct proportion with the dose without gender difference. After repeated administrations 
an accumulation ratio of about 5 based on AUC0-24h values, was observed. The PQ apparent 
elimination half-life evaluated was ~ 70-210 hours.  
The in vitro plasma protein binding of PQ evaluated in rat, dog and humans suggested that the binding 
of PQ to plasma proteins could be considered virtually complete (>99%).  
An in vivo study performed in rats to assess the tissue and organ distribution of total radioactivity after 
a single oral dose of 80mg/kg [14C]-PQP and 10mg/kg of DHA indicated an extensive distribution of 
[14C]-PQ. About 36% of the administered dose was still found in the body 168 hours after 
administration both in male (albino and pigmented) and female rat. Apart from the gastrointestinal 
tract, the highest concentrations of the radioactivity were measured in adrenal glands, bone marrow, 
lachrymal glands, liver, lungs pituitary and spleen. High levels of radioactivity were also measured in 
ovaries of the female rats. Overall, there was no qualitative gender difference in distribution of the 
radioactivity. Concentrations of radioactivity in blood were higher than in plasma suggesting that an 
association of radioactivity with blood cells occurred.  
In the pigmented rats the maximal level of radioactivity in the eyes was approximately tenfold higher 
than in the albino rats, indicating a significant binding of [14C]-PQ to melanin-containing tissues.  
The autoradioluminography of the whole uterus of the pregnant animals showed a distribution of 
radioactivity in the foetuses, mainly concentrated in the foetal liver, indicating a placental transfer after 
administration.  
The metabolite profile of PQ in human hepatocytes was not affected by the co-incubation of DHA. PQ 
was the main compound detected after 2 hours incubation with mouse, dog and human hepatocytes, 
accounting for 75-89% of total drug-related material. Conversely, with rat hepatocytes unchanged PQP 
accounted for only 7%. PQ was mainly metabolized through oxidation. Four mono-oxidated metabolites 
were detected. M1 was the main metabolite in rat and mouse, accounting for 75% and 14% of total 
drug-related material, respectively. M3 was the main metabolite in dog and humans accounting for 7% 
and 9%, respectively. This metabolite has already been identified in humans in vivo. In addition, M10, 
M2 and M4 were present in low amounts (up to 3%). M4 was detected only in the dog.  
No phase II metabolites of PQ were detected in any species.  
DHA is the main active metabolite of artesunate. When administered intravenously to male rats 
[14C]DHA was converted principally to the biologically inactive α-DHA-β-glucuronide (α-DHA-G). DHA 
is also eliminated in bile as minor glucuronides of nonendoperoxide isomers, namely tetrahydrofurano 
acetate and 3-hydroxydesoxy rearrangement product. 
Studies using human liver microsomes showed that [3H]DHA-G was the only detectable metabolite of 
[3H]DHA. From an in vitro study (Ilett et al 2002) it was verified that the main UDP-
glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) involved in the DHA metabolism in humans were UGT1A9 and 
UGT2B7.  
In a mass balance study following a single dose of 90mgkg of [14C]PQP/DHA combination product to 
male and female rats the recovery of the total radioactivity within 720 hours after administration 
accounted for approximately 97.5% of the dose in both genders. About 80% of the dose was 
eliminated in faeces, while the urinary excretion accounted for about 4% of the dose. Approximately

46% of the dose was eliminated in faeces within the first 24 hours. At the end of the collection period 
of excreta (720 hours) about 13% of the dose was recovered from the carcasses.  
After administration to male rats, the radioactivity in whole blood reached the maximal concentration 
within 24 hours post-dosing. The radioactivity in blood was detectable up to 720 hours, resulting in an 
average apparent terminal half-life of 222 hours.  
In plasma, the maximal radioactivity concentration was achieved at 3 hours post-dosing. Detectable 
levels of radioactivity were measured up to 24 hours post-dosing.  
The half-life of piperaquine in plasma was similar to that of total radioactivity in blood, indicating that 
both concentrations declined in parallel.  
In blood, plasma and milk, mean maximal concentrations of radioactivity were achieved 24, 3 and 6 h 
post dosing respectively. After the peak, blood and milk concentrations seemed to decline in parallel, 
whilst the decay of the plasma concentrations seemed to be faster than those in blood and milk. In 
milk, the maximal concentration of total radioactivity was attained 6 h post-dosing, indicating a rapid 
distribution. In terms of AUC, total radioactivity in milk was two and seven times higher than those in 
blood and plasma, respectively. Overall, the systemic exposure values indicated a rapid and extensive 
distribution of total radioactivity in milk. In addition, relevant and time-dependent distribution of total 
radioactivity into red blood cells was observed.  
Three toxicology studies contributed additional pharmacokinetic data regarding PQ and the conclusions 
are outlined below.  
Following repeated oral dosing of DHA/PQP in male and female rats (90 and 270mg/kg/day over 14 
days) the PQ plasma concentrations were found to be quite “flat” over the 24 hours observed following 
last dose administered. Due to the long T1/2 observed in rats, PQ accumulated in plasma after multiple 
dosing. No gender differences were observed. Cmax and AUC0-24h values of PQ increased linearly, but 
without a clear proportionality with the dose in the dose range investigated.  
After single and repeated administrations of DHA/PQP during the 4-week toxicity study in rats, no 
relevant gender differences were observed in the PK of PQ. On Day 1, systemic exposure to PQ did not 
deviate substantially from dose proportionality. After repeated oral administrations at all doses, 
detectable concentrations of PQ were measured up to the end of the experiment (360 h post last 
dosing). Systemic exposure increased with the dose in the dose range investigated. Average 
accumulation ratio, based on AUC0-24h values, was in the range 2-4, suggesting accumulation after 
repeated administrations.  
During the 4-week toxicity study in dogs, no relevant gender differences were observed in the PK of 
PQ. After single oral administration of DHA/PQP at 22.5mg/kg dose, dogs were exposed to PQ levels 
below the limit of the quantification of the analytical method (10ng/mL). At the other two doses, 90 
and 180mg/kg, the systemic exposure to PQ increased rather in direct proportion to the dose.  
Following 27 days of repeated oral administration of PQP/DHA combination product, the animals 
resulted exposed to PQ at all the three tested doses. Accumulation was observed at 22.5 and 
90mg/kg, when the compound was administered daily. Conversely, at 180mg/kg every other day, PQ 
accumulation was negligible.  
In toxicity studies in animals, daily dosing was performed to conservatively evaluate toxicity during 
repeated exposure over 2 and 4 weeks in rats and 4 weeks in dogs. It should be born in mind that 
three days of dosing in humans is not too dissimilar to a single dose in pharmacokinetic terms (when 
one considers exposure in relation to the very long half-life of PQ in adults and children, of about 21-
22 days). Eurartesim is not intended for chronic dosing, so animal studies using a chronic dosing 
regimen should be interpreted with caution.

For the safety factor calculation the cumulative AUC over the entire period of treatment in rats and 
dogs were compared to the cumulative therapeutic AUC in humans. This analysis shows that at the 
30mg/kg/day dose in rat and the 22.5mg/kg/day dose in dogs, the exposure levels in animals exceed 
those in humans during the clinical dosing regimen. Animals tolerated exposures over of the duration 
of treatment at Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) that were at least 11-17 fold above the human 
exposure during the clinical dosing regimen. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
DHA/PQP and its individual components DHA, PQP and the DHA degradation products ST3463 (DKA) 
and ST5126 (DOA), have been tested in single-dose and repeat-dose toxicity studies in mice, rats and 
Beagle dogs. The toxicokinetics of PQP has been determined in rats and in Beagle dogs. The genotoxic 
potential of DHA and PQP has been assessed in vitro in bacterial reverse mutation assays, but not for 
chromosomal aberration.  
Single dose toxicity 
Single doses of 270mg/kg DHA/PQP in rats, and 200mg/kg DHA in mice showed no clinical adverse 
reactions. 
In addition to DHA, the potential toxicity of DKA given alone or in combination with DHA (DHA + 5% 
DKA) was also assessed. At doses of 100 and 200mg/kg, the combination of DHA and 5% DKA did not 
cause any adverse clinical reactions. DKA given alone did not show any toxicity at the doses tested.  
The potential toxicity of a single-dose of DHA or its degradation product DOA given alone was 
assessed. DHA and DOA were given to CD-1 male mice as a single oral administration at the doses of 
400, 800 and 1200mg/kg each. DHA did not show signs of overt toxicity up to 1200mg/kg. After 
administration of the high dose of 1200mg/kg, DOA only induced a slight transient hypoactivity.  
Repeat dose toxicity 
DHA/PQP from 14 to 28 days repeated dosing to rat and Beagle dog. 
The five-day repeat-dose oral toxicity study in mice revealed no significant differences in toxicity of 
DHA, when given alone or in combination with DKA.  
In the corresponding study for the qualification of DOA CD-1 male mice were administered doses of 
200, 400 or 800mg/kg DHA alone or in combination with DOA (DHA+ 3% DOA) for five days.  The low 
dose of 200mg/kg/day of DHA given alone or in combination with DOA at 6mg/kg/day, under the 
conditions applied in the present study, was considered the NOAEL.  
An additional 5 day repeat-dose toxicity study was carried out in Beagle dogs as part of the 
qualification of DHA degradation products (0487-2008). Animals were administered doses of 45 or 
90mg/kg DHA/PQP alone or in combination with 10% DKA+ 3% DOA.  The high dose of 90mg/kg/day 
of DHA/PQP alone or in combination with DHA degradation products, under the experimental conditions 
applied in the study was considered the NOAEL.  
In the two-week repeat-dose toxicity study 270mg/kg/day DHA/PQP given to rats was regarded as the 
MTD. Further increase of the dose to 540mg/kg/day caused acute toxicity to progress to lethal effects, 
accompanied by decreases in reticulocytes, increases in AST and ALT, and most severe clinical signs in 
high dose animals. Morphological changes were dose dependent from 90 to 540mg/kg/day and were

Page 25/129
 
 
 
mainly characterized by infiltration of macrophages, and by intracytoplasmic deposition of basophilic 
granular materials in macrophages. These changes were consistent with phospholipidosis.  
The results from the 14-day rat study were confirmed in the 28-day rat oral toxicity study at dose 
levels of 30mg/kg/day, 90mg/kg/day and 270mg/kg/day. The top dose of 270mg/kg/day DHA/PQP 
was lethal in the week 4 of treatment. 90mg/kg/day of DHA/PQP was considered the MTD.  
In the 4-week study one group of animals was treated with chloroquine. Because of early mortality in 
this group, the dose was reduced from 90mg/kg/day to 30mg/kg/day. Similar infiltration of foamy 
macrophages was observed, although it was less prominent than with DHA/PQP. Chloroquine also 
induced morphological changes such as myofibre degeneration mainly in diaphragm and skeletal 
muscles. These findings were not observed in the DHA/PQP groups.  
In a 4-week oral toxicity study 22.5mg/kg/day, 90mg/kg/day, and 180mg/kg/day DHA/PQP (enriched 
with 5% ST3463) were administered to Beagle dogs. From day 8 onwards, 180mg/kg was only 
administered every second day. Animals being treated with 180mg/kg every second day showed 
similar adverse reactions to those treated with 90mg/kg/day. The main findings in 90mg/kg/day 
treated animals were some sporadic variations in clinical characteristics such as a decrease in activity 
or food intake, some variations in clinical chemistry (decrease in albumin or increase of globulin and 
cholesterol) and the appearance of foamy macrophages in various organs. Consistently, all repeated 
dose toxicity studies showed morphological alterations in a dose dependent manner. The 22.5mg/kg 
dose was regarded to be the NOAEL.  
Phospholipidosis was observed after administration of PQP in all repeat-dose toxicity studies and is a 
well known morphological finding from preclinical studies with cationic amphiphilic drugs. Chloroquine 
is a cationic amphiphilic drug, which can also induce formation of lamellar bodies in cells. It has been 
suggested that the induction of lamellar bodies, and phospholipidosis, respectively, are independent of 
toxicity. Indeed, phospholipidosis has been observed in cells without signs of toxicity.  Phospholipidosis 
does not seem to be predictable with regard to severity and incidence, but lipid composition of the cells 
affected and half-life or potential for accumulation may determine the likelihood of phospholipidosis.  
The prolonged pharmacological effect of PQP may account for the higher level of phospholipidosis in 
animals treated with PQP at 270mg/kg compared to those treated with chloroquine at a dose of 
90mg/kg.  
No significant differences were observed between PQP and chloroquine treated animals at 90mg/kg. 
Observations in chloroquine treated animals such as the presence of inclusion bodies in the cornea 
epithelium, and opacities in the lens of the eyes, have not been observed in PQP treated animals in the 
current studies.  
The applicant provided a profound discussion on the deaths observed in dogs and rats in the repeated 
dose toxicity studies. Mortality data and the results of post-mortem examination obtained in toxicity 
studies after administration of DHA/PQP for 2 or 4 weeks in rats and for 4 weeks in dogs, have been 
thoroughly reviewed. This review indicates that (i) the death of a dog was probably induced by poor 
general condition and intestinal symptoms; and (ii) the death of the rats at the highest dose level (270 
mg/kg) was most probably the result of very poor condition due to the accumulation of PQP in almost 
all the tissues. Moreover, there was no evidence that the cause of these deaths was linked to either 
cardiotoxicity or neurotoxicity.

Genotoxicity 
The genotoxic potential of PQP, DHA, DKA and DOA was studied in four Salmonella typhimurium 
reverse mutation assays. It was demonstrated that neither DHA nor PQP or DKA have any mutagenic 
potential in the bacterial mutation assays performed. In response to questions concerning the potential 
genotoxicity of the above compounds, the applicant re-evaluated all the historical data.  The applicant 
also conducted, with DHA and PQP, in vitro chromosomal aberration assays in human lymphocytes and 
micronucleus tests in rat and in CHO cells. When considered together, the data demonstrate that DHA 
and PQP are not genotoxic. 
Carcinogenicity 
No data is available in the literature on the carcinogenicity of DHA or PQP or the combination. As 
treatment is only intended to be given for three days, carcinogenicity tests are not required. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Concerning reproductive toxicity, non-clinical data on the effects of DHA in pregnancy is available in 
the literature and no further non clinical studies were deemed necessary. DHA/PQP is to be 
administered according to WHO 2006 guidelines. The applicant states that they are conducting studies 
to assess the use of DHA/PQP in pregnant women.  
There is non-clinical data on reproductive toxicity available on the effect of PQP from recently 
completed studies carried out by Sigma-tau. The final reports from these studies have now been made 
available which show that PQP did not show any teratogenic effects in rats or rabbits when treated with 
a dose of 80mg/kg during the embryofoetal stage (GD6 to GD17) or in the rat when treatment was 
continued through gestation until the first day of parturition (GD6 to GD21). PQP also did not affect the 
course of pregnancy. In the rabbit Segment II study (0140-2008) no plasma levels of PQ were 
detected at dose levels below 80mg/kg. The applicant provided a plausible explanation for this finding. 
There was no effect of PQP on delivery at doses below 80mg/kg in rats. However in animals receiving 
either an interrupted treatment of 80mg/kg or continuous treatment some effects were observed. 
These animals exhibited prolonged gestation, altered modality of delivery and increased perinatal 
mortality. Individual variation was observed with some animals delivering normally and others showing 
complications. Of the animals who delivered normally, PQP did not interfere with lactation or pup 
growth (body weight gain). Food consumption, behavioural development or sexual maturity up to 
weaning was also unaffected, even when pups were exposed to PQP during the suckling period.  
The role of embryonic erythroblasts in the developmental toxicity of artemisinin derivatives has been 
investigated in vivo in rats (White et al 2006, Longo et al. 2006a), in monkeys (Clark et al 2008a), and 
in vitro in rat whole embryo culture (Longo et al 2006a, 2006b). This literature has recently been 
summarized by Clark (2009).  The depletion of primitive red blood cells in the embryo is likely a 
primary cause of developmental toxicity by artemisinins.  Antiangiogenic properties of this class of 
compounds may contribute to their developmental toxicity, although in vitro and in vivo data suggest 
that effects on angiogenesis occur after effects on primitive RBCs have been observed. 
There were no studies in juvenile animals. The applicant states that although children are included in 
the target patient population, studies on juvenile animals were not deemed necessary, in view of the 
existing clinical experience in children with the combination. The need for juvenile animal studies has 
been superseded by clinical experience.

Other toxicity studies 
Concerning PQP impurities ST3106, ST3590, ST3593, ST3591, ST3592, ST5701, ST5702 the limits of 
these impurities has now been tightened to not more than the ICH Q3A/Q3B qualification threshold,  
except for ST3590. Appropriate qualification studies were conducted on this impurity which can be 
considered to be toxicologically qualified. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant has conducted an ERA for DHA and PQP. 
Eurartesim is indicated for the treatment of an orphan condition in the EU. Consequently the default 
Fpen value is assumed to be 0.0005. The share prediction is assumed to be 100%. The applicant was 
requested to provide a clear explanation as to the provenance of the values used in the calculation of 
the ERA and to consider the issue of the dosing schedule of Eurartesim.  
The applicant asserted that proposed dosing schedule is no more than once a year. Consequently, in 
the calculation, the following is considered: One treatment per year, and the maximal dose i.e. 4 
tablets (320 mg of PQP + 40 mg of DHA) once a day over three consecutive days. The total daily dose 
is 1,280 mg of PQP and 160 mg of DHA. The total dose for one treatment is 3,840 mg of PQP and 480 
mg of DHA. For a total of 8,000 treatments that means per year: 30.720 kg of PQP, that means about 
18 kg of PQ and 3.840 kg of DHA. Considering the 20,000 treatments /year (Orphan drug status), 
76.800 kg of PQP, or 45 kg of PQ and 9.300 kg of DHA. Whatever the mode of calculation the PECs 
remain below the limit of 0.01. 
According to Wu J. et al, the log Kow for DHA is 2.19. (Wu J et al. 1982). Using the software DEREK, 
(Derek for Window Ver 12.0.0; Lhasa Ltd), Log Kp calculation is 2.4508. With both sources, the log 
Kow is below 4.5. 
The value of the Log Kow (or Log P) for PQP is 5.8 as fully reported in Report N° CAD-PCPS-ST3073-
09-023.  Based on the Log Kow value of 5.8, piperaquine is being evaluated for persistence, 
bioaccumulation and toxicity according to the EU TGD.  The potential for persistence will be evaluated 
based on transformation of piperaquine in water-sediment systems as per OECD 308.  Bioaccumulation 
potential will be determined based on the fish bioconcentration study following OECD 305.  The toxicity 
of piperaquine to aquatic organisms will be determined based on data from the fish early life stage 
study (OECD 210), the reproductive toxicity to Daphnia magna (OECD 211), and toxicity to green alga 
(OECD 201).  
In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for further investigation to be addressed: 
The applicant should submit all the relevant final audited end-of –study reports and an updated 
overview of the ERA to take into account the new data. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Due to the long history, extensive clinical exposure in the target population, as well as data available 
on PQP and DHA, the traditional battery of formal non-clinical studies has not been performed. The 
non-clinical studies focused on areas of concern.  
Additional studies have been performed as per request by the CHMP (hERG study, further mechanistic 
studies on QT prolongation, tests evaluating chromosomal damage to have a robust evaluation of 
Assessment Report  
EMA/739355/2011

clastogenicity) as well as mandatory tests to qualify impurities/degradation products according to 
updated specifications. 
Neither block of hERG currents, nor inhibition of hERG channel trafficking, nor block of cardiac IKs 
seem to be responsible for the marked QT interval prolonging effects of Eurartesim observed in 
humans (see further). The results of the studies in the isolated perfused rabbit left ventricular 
preparation indicate that the marked QT interval prolongation observed in humans after administration 
of Eurartesim is primarily caused by the PQP component, although PQP did not induce early-after-
depolarisations. The results of these in vitro experiments indicate that the torsadogenic potential is low 
for the PQP component and does not increase when PQP is co-administered with DHA. 
Neurotoxicity is a potential risk of artemisinin derivatives, further considered as part of the RMP.  
However, there was no evidence of DHA-induced lesions in the specific nuclei in rats or dogs, even at 
lethal dose. Neurotoxicity of orally administered DHA in humans can be considered highly unlikely, 
given the rapid clearance of DHA and its short exposure.   
Experience with DHA demonstrated that DHA has a low toxicity and that the most sensitive index of 
DHA toxicity is the decrease in reticulocyte count. In the non-clinical studies performed with 
Eurartesim, no decrease in reticulocyte count was seen which implies, the dose levels given for DHA 
were not sufficient to achieve toxicity.  
As main nonclinical safety findings after repeated dosing of Eurartesim were phospholipidosis and 
degenerative lesions in numerous organs and tissues. These adverse reactions were seen in animals at 
exposure levels similar to clinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use. It is not 
known whether these toxic effects are reversible.  Hence, an appropriate statement has been added to 
section 5.3 of the SmPC. 
Information that no reproductive toxicity studies had been performed with the combination of DHA and 
PQP is also included into section 5.3 of SmPC. Embryotoxic risk in humans is minimised via an SmPC 
warning (see SmPC section 4.6).  Additional risk minimisation measures are planned in this regard 
(pregnancy registry; educational outreach programme to health care workers). 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Eurartesim cardiovascular effects and the associated clinical findings were concluded to derive mainly 
from the effects of PQP.  As part of the investigation into the QTc prolongation potential of PQP, the 
applicant submitted data from mechanistic studies.  These experiments indicate that the torsadogenic 
potential of Eurartesim is not as high as expected from the clinical QT studies performed with 
Eurartesim. However, reference is made to section 3.4 (Clinical) for further discussion of the issue of 
QTc prolongation.  
Reproductive toxicity is a potential concern flagged in the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

GCP 
The study reports contain statements to the effect that they were conducted in accordance with the 
World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki and ICH Topic E6, Guideline for Good Clinical 
Practice, including the archiving of essential documents. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
GCP inspection 
At the time of review of the responses to the Day 120 List of Questions (LoQ) a GCP inspection was 
triggered. The CHMP endorsed the inspection report on 21 January 2011. The final conclusion was that 
there were no findings that would preclude acceptance of the safety and efficacy data provided from 
sponsored studies. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
There were three sponsored pharmacokinetic studies included in the initial application dossier as shown 
below. The three studies involved administration of Artekin (40 mg DHA plus 320 mg PQP 
[tetraphosphate] = 181 mg free PQ) or Eurartekin tablets (20 mg DHA and 160 mg PQP). 
Table 3 
Plasma concentrations of DHA and piperaquine (PQ) were determined. DHA was measured by LC-
MS/MS for which the validated assay had a LLOQ at 10 ng/mL. PQ was measured by LC-MS/MS that 
could only be validated to 20% at all levels and to 25% at the LLOQ. The validated assay had a LLOQ 
at 5 ng/mL.  
The single dose study in 16 healthy male Caucasian volunteers (ART-DFM-05-002) was conducted in 
Switzerland during 2005 and involved sampling up to Day 90. However, due to the insensitive assay 
the AUC DHA could not be calculated for 8/16 individuals and PQ was < LLOQ between 12 and 72 h 
post-dose with the exception of one subject with quantifiable PQ at 96 h post-dose and one at 144 h 
post-dose.

The study in adults with P. falciparum malaria (DM04-009) was conducted in Thailand during 2005-
2006. The ratio of AUC0-t/AUCinf for DHA was > 90% in all patients and plasma concentrations 
declined rapidly in a mono-exponential manner. The mean clearance value (1.34 L/h/kg) corresponded 
to 67 L/h in an adult malaria patient population weighing approximately 50 kg. The mean Vss/F was 
determined to be approximately 0.8 L/kg, which is about 40 L for a 50 kg individual.  
Table 4: 
Pharmacokinetic Results for DHA in Plasma 
The CV% estimates for PQ were high (Cmax PQ 61.6% and AUC0-24 47.0%), probably because there 
were multiple peaks observed for many individuals.  
Table 5: 
Pharmacokinetic Results for PQ in Plasma 
The data from these 25 adult malaria patients were included in PK compartmental analyses with 
separate modelling for the two actives.  
 
PK DHA was best described in a one-compartment model with first-order elimination and three 
first-order absorption processes with different absorption rate constants. Many patients exhibited 
multiple peaks in plasma concentration-time profiles, most likely to be due to intra-patient 
variability in DHA absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. It was estimated that about 28% of 
the bioavailable dose was absorbed with an absorption half-life of 0.617 hours. DHA exhibited “flip-
flop” kinetics and this was considered to explain a mean non-compartmental t½ of 1.04 hours 
whereas the mean elimination half-life determined from the model was 0.448 h. 
 
PQ PK was best described by a three-compartment model with first-order elimination and two first-
order absorption processes. The model indicated that the relative bioavailability of PQ on D1 was

87.4% compared to D0, while that on D2 was 121% of the D0 value. During the first 12 h many 
patients exhibited multiple peaks (or distinct phases) that suggested enterohepatic recirculation or 
variations in absorption through various segments of the gastrointestinal tract. The mean apparent 
total clearance (CL/F) was 1.12 L/h/kg. The total volume of distribution comprised a small central 
volume (26.7 L/kg), an intermediately sized peripheral space (76.8 L/kg) and a very large 
(second) peripheral space of 617 L/kg. The between patient variability was relatively high with an 
apparent total clearance coefficient of variability of 53% and individual estimates ranging from 
0.192 to 2.68 L/h/kg. The total volume of distribution was a little less variable with a coefficient of 
variation of 37.5% and individual estimates ranging from 254 to 1238 L/kg. The terminal 
elimination half life was very long at 576 hours (24 days) as a consequence of the very extensive 
distribution of PQ. 
The study in children with P. falciparum malaria (DM04-008) was conducted in Burkina Faso during 
2006. Dosing was as shown in the table with whole or crushed tablets administered with/in 120 mL of 
water. 
Table 6: 
DHA/PQP Dosing Regimen 
DHA again showed multiple-peak phenomena due to three absorption processes with slow and fast 
absorption rate constants varying from 0.76 to 6.20 l/h. The total (apparent) volume of distribution of 
DHA was 0.705 L/kg and the apparent total clearance (CL/F) was approximately 1.45 L/h/kg. The 
mean elimination half-life of DHA was 0.36 hours, although in many subjects flip-flop pharmacokinetics 
was occurring.  
PQ also exhibited multiple-peak phenomena. The first absorption process involved 67% of the PQ dose, 
the second had a lag time of 3.8 h and occurred with a rate constant of approximately 199 L/h. The 
total Vss/F was very large (623 L/kg) compared to the Vc/F (27 L/kg), suggesting extensive 
distribution in peripheral tissues. The mean elimination half-life was about 23 days and the apparent 
total clearance (CL/F) was approximately 1.3 L/h/kg. The relative bioavailability for D1 was slightly 
lower than for D0 with a geometric mean of 95.1%, which was ascribed to inter-occasion variability. 
The relative bioavailability for D2 compared to D0 was higher with a geometric mean of 119%. 
Due to sparse blood sampling a non compartmental analysis was not performed for DHA and PQ. As a 
consequence individual AUCINF values were calculated as Dose/CL/F) from the estimated Bayesian 
parameters. The correlations between CL/F or AUCINF versus BW or age were estimated and positive 
correlations were demonstrated between DHA and PQ CL/F with BW (Pearson correlation 
coefficient=0.703 for DHA and =0.691 for PQ, p-values <0.001 for both). CL/F of these drugs 
increased as the BW increased at least in the range about 7 to 18 kg. The CL/F correlation with age 
was considered likely to reflect the correlation between age and BW. Conversely, no correlations were 
observed between AUCINF values for DHA or PQ vs. BW or age, indicating comparable DHA and PQ in 
children who took 1 or 2 tablets of Eurartesim. From these analyses the applicant considered that the 
BW correction of the dose adopted for the paediatric population was justified from a pharmacokinetic 
point of view.

The comparison of Asian adults versus African children showed that in children the CL/F and Vss/F for 
PQ were within 20% of the adult values. The large volume of distribution of PQ led to very long half-life 
values (medians were 531 h and 468 h in adults and children, respectively). The apparent clearance 
was faster and the apparent total volume of distribution was smaller for the paediatric population, 
although the applicant considers that the differences (<20%) were not clinically important. 
Table 7: 
Bayesian PK Parameters: PQ in The Adult And Paediatric Populations 
Relatively small differences were observed for DHA PK between paediatric and adult populations. The 
mean CL/F was slightly higher while the mean Vss/F was smaller for children versus adults and the 
elimination rate constant was slightly faster. Again, the applicant concluded the differences were 
minor. 
Table 8: 
Bayesian PK Parameters: DHA In The Adult And Paediatric Populations 
During the assessment period the applicant provided additional PK data from three sponsored 
studies that had been initiated since submitting the licensing application.  
These were as follows: 
DM09-006 
PK data were obtained during this parallel group study of effects on QTc vs. Riamet  (arthemeter/ 
lumefantrine)(Group 2) and vs. placebo (Group 3) in healthy male and female subjects. In the four 
initial study groups Eurartesim was administered daily for 3 days after high fat/low kcal (Group 1) or 
high fat/high kcal (Group 4) meals. Two additional groups provided data on dosing in the fasted state 
(Group 5) vs. placebo Group 6). The study design and findings are reported under 
“Pharmacodynamics” (see below) along with the correlations between plasma levels and effects on 
QTc.  
While the plasma profiles for DHA were comparable between Groups 1 and 4 (Eurartesim in the two 
fed states) there were some differences vs. Group 5 (fasted). There were no clear gender differences. 
After repeated oral administration of Eurartesim over 3 days there was no accumulation of DHA in 
plasma with ratios (Day 3 / Day 1) of about 0.98 and 0.96 for Cmax and AUC0-t, respectively, in 
Group 1. Similarly, Group 4 data gave ratios (Day 3 / Day 1) of about 1.02 for Cmax and 1.03 for 
AUC0-t and the ratios for Group 5 (fasted) were 0.87 for Cmax and 0.91 for AUC0-t.

Figure 3: 
Mean plasma concentration of DHA vs. time profiles obtained on Day 3 after 
repeated oral administration of Eurartesim™ in male and female volunteers 
for group 1, group 4 and group 5 (linear scale) 
On 
Day 3 there were no significant differences observed between the two groups dosed in the fed state for 
mean Cmax and AUC values. However, the Day 3 comparison of the fed and fasted Groups 1 vs. 5 
gave a statistically significant (p<0.05) increase of about 40% in mean DHA Cmax in the fed state. 
Similarly dosing with food gave an average difference of about 35% or 30% for AUC0-t and AUC0-∞, 
respectively, compared with dosing in the fasted state (p<0.05). Therefore the study demonstrated a 
negative effect on plasma exposure to DHA when Eurartesim was dosed in the fasted state.  
Mean PQ plasma profiles on Days 1 and 3 obtained in the fed state (Groups 1 and 4) followed a 
comparable pattern. PQ was quite slowly absorbed with a median Tmax at 4 h post-dose in the fed 
state and 3 h in the fasted state. Multiple peaks were seen in the concentration-time profiles, 
suggesting enterohepatic recycling. After repeated dosing and regardless of fed/fasted states mean 
plasma PQ tended to be higher in female subjects. Repeated oral administration of Eurartesim over 3 
days resulted in an increase in PQ plasma concentrations irrespective of the dosing conditions so that 
ratios for mean Cmax (Day 3/Day 1) were 2.43-, 2.46- and 3.03- fold higher on Day 3 for Groups 1, 4 
and 5, respectively. The same evaluation cannot be made for AUC0-t because of the different sampling 
schemes on Days 1 and 3. 
On Day 3 the mean Cmax was 34% lower and mean AUC was 35% lower with a high-fat/low-Kcal 
(Group 1) than high-fat/high-Kcal (Group 4) meal (p<0.05). Comparison between Groups 1 and 5 
(fasted) showed that mean Cmax was doubled when dosing was with food and there were increases of 
about 46% and 77% for AUC0-t and AUC0-24.

The study directly compared PK between healthy Asian (A) and Caucasian (C) subjects of both genders 
and ≤ 65 kg dosed with Eurartesim (3 days) at 15 minutes after the start of a meal (360 kcal; 25% 
kcal from fat) and with 200 ml water.  
Mean DHA AUC values on D0 (table) and on D2 (figure) were numerically higher for Asians (A). There 
were numerically higher exposures in female subjects. Statistically significant differences were found 
for Tmax on D0, t1/2 on D0 and D2 and AUC and CL/F on D2, giving a slightly shorter t/1/2 and higher 
CL/F in male subjects. The applicant proposed that the differences could be related to greater 
metabolic induction in male subjects since there was a more substantial decrease in AUC by D2 
compared to female subjects.

  higher Cmax for PQ in female subjects on D2

An additional cohort of 24 male Caucasians of body weight > 65 kg was enrolled and received 3 or 4 
tablets daily (with the same light breakfast) according to weight ≤ or > 75 kg. The Caucasian male and 
female subjects with BW ≤ 65 kg had numerically higher plasma exposures to DHA and PQ on D0 and 
D2 vs. the additional cohort of Caucasian male subjects with BW > 65 kg.

no difference between dose groups for AUCs on D2 for PQ although higher mean Cmax and AUC were 
observed with 4 tablets on D0.

provided plots based on corresponding PK parameters vs. BW from DM09-006, 007 and 008 (see 
below).  
  DHA CL/F but not V
z/F positively correlated (p < 0.0001) with BW up to 75 kg. In the BW range 75 
to ~100 kg the CL/F seemed to be constant, which the applicant considers to be an indication that 
a further dose adjustment for BW is not necessary.  
 
For PQ mean Cmax and AUC0-24 after a single dose 
of drug were compared to BW due to the 
different dose regimens, blood sampling schemes and the PQ half-life. Also, subjects who recei
ved 
Eurartesim without food (DM09008) were excluded from the plots so the analysis concerned only 
subjects dosed with a light meal or a high fat meal. The plots indicate that Cmax and AUC values 
were very variable but the spread of values was comparable regardless of whether subjects 
received 3 or 4 tablets according to body weight.

DM09-008 
This was a food effect study in healthy Caucasian male subjects ≥ 75 kg. Subjects were randomised to 
one of two pa
rallel groups to take a single dose of Eurartesim (4 tablets; 160 mg DHA and 1280 mg 
PQP) as follows: 
The high fat meal provided 800-1000 kcal with 500-600 kcal derived from the fat content. No food and 
o
nly water was allowed from 1-4 h after dosing. The two groups received tablets from different sub-
lots. Blood samples were collected very frequently in the first 24 h and then at intervals to 60 h 
followed by daily sampling out to 7 days.  
For DHA, the AUC0-∞ was significantly greater in the fed state (mean ratio fed/fasted = 144%) 
while 
the Cmax ratio was 129% (not statistically
 significant at the 5% level). There was also a significant 
delay in median Tmax from 1 to 2 h.

From comparisons across sponsored studies (see tables below) the data suggested that plasma 
exposures to DHA are greater in infected subjects vs. healthy volunteers whereas for PQ the effect of 
acute malaria on plasma exposures was concluded to be minimal or negligible. 
For DHA there is an effect of food. However there is overlap in values reported among the various 
groups of healthy subjects dosed in fed and fasted states and a stark difference between all these 
values and those for the subjects with acute malaria from whom PK data were obtained in the Phase 2 
study DM04-009. This is especially notable when taking into account that the applicant claimed they 
were likely dosed at least 3-6 h after any food intake.  
For PQ the picture is quite different since the effect of food is much greater and this predominates over 
the comparisons made, assuming that the low plasma exposures in Asians with malaria reflects the 
fact that they were likely dosed on an empty or near empty stomach. The applicant considers that 
dosing PQ in the fasted state was associated with a higher degree of inter-subject variability for PK 
parameters than in fed subjects as shown in Table 113.2, which is proposed to reflect the lower and 
more variable PQP absorption in the absence of concomitant food intake.

Factors that might contribute to the observed inter-subject variability include the PQ and DHA 
concentrations in RBCs and the large volume of distribution for PQ. The concentrations of both drugs 
determined in plasma represent a minor part of the total drug in circulation and inter-individual 
variation in blood/plasma and/or tissue/plasma partition coefficients may produce variability in plasma 
concentrations.  
Absorption  
Bioavailability 
In a published study single oral doses of artesunate (3 x 50 mg tablets) and DHA (2 x 60 mg tablets) 
and an IV dose of 120 mg artesunate were each administered to healthy subjects and subjects with P. 
falciparum malaria in a cross-over design.  
The absolute bioavailability of DHA was consistently lower after administration of DHA than after 
administration of oral artesunate in the healthy volunteers (45% and 80%, respectively) and was 
attributed to lower DHA absorption and/or a higher first-pass effect. The relative bioavailability of oral 
DHA compared to oral artesunate in patients was 88%. Cmax and AUC were significantly greater in 
patients with malaria than in healthy volunteers. This was possibly attributed to a lower first-pass 
clearance. The terminal elimination half-life of DHA was about 1 h in healthy volunteers and patients. 
Eurartesim tablets were administered whole or crushed in the Phase 3 studies in accordance with the 
protocol. The applicant demonstrated that the dissolution profiles (as assessed at pH 1.2, 4.5 and 6.8, 
with and without surfactant) for the crushed and un-crushed tablets were super-imposable, indicating 
that the DHA absorption profile should be the same in children taking either a crushed or an un-
crushed tablet. The dissolution testing under similar conditions for PQP also showed no differences 
between crushed and un-crushed tablets. Also, since the PQ absorption process is very slow with Tmax 
at about 5 h so it is unlikely that the rate of dissolution would significantly influence PQ absorption.  
Distribution 
The applicant’s studies using a monolayer of a CLEFF9 sub-clone of human Caco-2 cells with high P-
glycoprotein-mediated efflux suggested that DHA (1 and 20 μM) and PQP (20 μM) are not substrates 
for P-glycoprotein. Evaluation of the plasma protein binding of PQ in rat, dog and humans in vitro 
indicated that binding in all species tested could be considered virtually complete (>99% at the highest 
concentration tested). In another study reported by the applicant the blood to plasma ratio of PQ in 
vivo in rat was found to be around 4.4 - 7.0 up to 8 h with a ratio of 26.5 at 24 h post-dosing with 
14C-PQP/DHA in combination. 
The in-vitro protein binding of DHA has been reported to be in the range of 47-76%. In one study 10-
[3H]-DHA was incubated with blood from 15 healthy volunteers (Vietnamese and Caucasian) and from 
22 Vietnamese patients infected with P. falciparum or P. vivax previously treated with artesunate. The 
results suggested that DHA is approximately 93% protein bound in patients with malaria and 88-91% 
bound in healthy volunteers. [3H]-DHA is taken up and concentrated by isolated red blood cell 
membranes but not by intact uninfected erythrocytes. There is no association of the drug with either 
the membrane or cytoplasm of intact red cells. In addition, erythrocytes infected with P. falciparum 
have been shown to take up artemisinin derivatives to concentrations greater than 100-fold those in 
uninfected erythrocytes. This selective uptake has been demonstrated to involve a carrier-mediated 
mechanism in contrast to the simple, passive diffusion of artemisinins into non-infected red blood cells.

Elimination 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Information was provided from the literature.  
 
The pharmacokinetic properties of PQ were assessed from a 2008 study in which subjects received 
single ascending oral doses of 500, 750, 1000, 1250 and 1500 mg PQP and also once-daily doses 
of 500, 750, 1000 and 1500 mg for 3 consecutive days. The dose exposure relationship was linear 
but less than proportional after single and multiple dosing. 
  A 2004 study included 20 healthy male and female Thai subjects who received a single dose of 
DHA of 2 or 4 mg/kg, which corresponded to a total dose ~100 and 200 mg for a 50 kg person. 
Analyses conducted according to non compartmental and (one) compartmental approaches gave 
comparable values of dose-independent PK parameters at both doses tested. Linearity was 
demonstrated by dose-proportional increases in Cmax and AUC INF. 
Special populations 
Regarding the effects of renal and hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of DHA and/or PQ: 
  Malaria per se has an effect on DHA disposition, which may reflect malaria-associated impairment 
of hepatic function causing an increase in DHA bioavailability (reduction in hepatic first-pass 
extraction) without affecting its apparent elimination half-life, which is absorption rate limited.  
  Severe malaria can also have an impact on renal function but data from a study of intravenous 
artesunate to treat severe and moderately severe malaria suggested that renal impairment 
complicating falciparum malaria did not alter DHA clearance significantly.  
 
It is considered unlikely that mild or moderate renal impairment would have an effect on the 
disposition of PQ. A slight reduction in protein binding of neutral or basic compounds could slightly 
increase CL/F and Vss/F but it is not thought this would occur to a clinically significant extent.  
  Hepatic impairment may influence PQ disposition. In cirrhotic patients, a decrease in protein 
binding and metabolic clearance may have an impact on PQ plasma concentrations and on its 
Vss/F, causing also a prolongation of PQ half-life. Furthermore in case of obstructive jaundice, the 
excretion of PQ through the bile may be compromised.   
 
In the absence of clinical data in patients with severe renal or hepatic impairment and the limited 
experience in subjects with lesser degrees of insufficiency, the SmPC advises caution when 
administering Eurartesim with a specific recommendation for ECG and blood potassium monitoring. 
Specific studies in patients with moderate or severe renal and/or hepatic impairment are not 
planned by the applicant given the very low frequency with which such patients are expected to 
travel from Europe to malaria-endemic areas. 
Regarding the potential for genetic polymorphism to affect the pharmacokinetics of DHA and/or PQ: 
 
PQ - There is no evidence that CYP3A4 gene polymorphism plays a major role in establishing highly 
variable CYP3A4 expression and function although, in very rare cases, defective CYP3A4 mutations 
may cause drug toxicity. A small proportion of the population (up to 6% in different ethnic groups) 
are CYP2C9 poor metabolisers while 2-7% of Africans, 10-30% of Asians and 2-5% of Caucasians 
are CYP2C19 poor metabolisers. Poor metabolisers may exhibit a several-fold higher than average 
area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) after administration of compounds that are 
Assessment Report  
EMA/739355/2011  
Page 44/129
 
 
 
exclusive substrates of CYP2C9 or CYP2C19. However, considering the low clearance of PQ and the 
minor contribution of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 to its metabolism, significant differences in plasma 
concentrations between poor and extensive metabolisers are not expected. 
  DHA - UGT2A9 and UGT2B7 are known to have genetic variants. The UGT1A9 poor metaboliser 
phenotype occurs in < 1% of persons but 4-10% of Africans, 6-7% of Asians and 20-25% of 
Caucasians are poor metabolisers for UGT2B7. Nevertheless, UGT2B7 makes only a minor 
contribution to DHA metabolism so it is considered unlikely that variations in enzyme activity would 
have a significant effect on plasma concentrations.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No drug-drug interaction studies were performed. Regarding the potential for absorption-based drug-
drug interactions with DHA and/or PQ: 
 
Published findings suggest that DHA (1 and 20µM) and PQ (20µM) are not substrates for P-gp. PQ 
was shown to be a weak inhibitor of P-gp so it might affect the absorption of P-gp substrates (e.g. 
digoxin).  However, the mean IC50 was 74 µM in the B-A direction and 11 mM in the A-B direction 
with the IC50 determined from the efflux of 3H-digoxin being 7 µM.   
  DHA is practically insoluble in water. Although DHA is sensitive to acidic conditions it is not 
expected that antacids, H2-antagonists or proton-pump inhibitors would have an influence on 
absorption and it is unlikely that DHA could affect the absorption of other drugs.  
 
PQP is slightly soluble in water and its solubility is expected to decrease at increased pH. This 
raises the possibility that antacids, H2-antagonists or proton-pump inhibitors might impact on PQ 
bioavailability due to reduced solubility.  However, the PQ absorption process is very slow (Tmax ~ 
5 h), suggesting that significant absorption does not occur in the stomach. Therefore, medicinal 
products that increase gastric pH are not expected to have an effect.   
 
The enterohepatic recirculation of PQ and influence of food indicate that bile production may play a 
role in PQ absorption.  
Results of the sponsor’s study of the potential for PQ and DHA to inhibit and/or induce enzymes of 
possible metabolic importance are summarised in the table.

b) PQ inhibited CYP3A4 with an IC 50 of 5µM (Gigras R et al. 2008) 
c) UGT1A9 was the main isoform for DHA metabolism, although a contribution of UGT2B7 was observed. DHA was not substrate in 
UGT1A1 and UGT1A6 (Ilett et al 2002). 
d) Also observed by Bapiro et al. 2001 
nc: the efflux ratio can not be calculated (test compound in the receiver samples was below the limit of quantitation)  
PQ was mainly metabolised by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. PQ at 10µM 
inhibited CYP3A4 in a time-dependent fashion and CYP2C19 but stimulated the activity of CYP2E1. PQ 
did not induce CYP1A, CYP2B6 or CYP3A at 0.1-10 µM. The fact that PQ was not an inducer of CYP2A 
implies that it is also not likely to induce CYP2C8, CYP2C9 or CYP2C1. Furthermore, it is unlikely that 
PQ is an inducer of P-gp since the induction of both CYP3A and P-gp are regulated by PXR. 
PQ has the potential to increase plasma concentrations of CYP3A4 substrates, such as HMG CoA 
reductase inhibitors and some drugs with a narrow therapeutic index might also be affected (e.g. anti-
retroviral drugs and cyclosporin). Co-administration might lead to increases in plasma levels of several 
drugs that prolong the QT interval (e.g. macrolides, pimozide, terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride). PQ 
may reduce the rate of metabolism of CYP2C19 substrates such as omeprazole and decrease plasma 
concentrations of CYP2E1 substrates such as paracetamol and the anaesthetic gases (enflurane, 
halothane, isoflurane).  
In the applicant’s study DHA was not an inducer of CYP1A, CYP2B6 or CYP3A at 0.1-25µM). DHA was 
not an inducer of CYP2A so it is not likely to induce CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C1 or P-gp. It has been 
reported in the literature that DHA inhibits CYP1A2 in vitro while it showed a small effect in vivo on 
some cytochrome P450 isoenzymes in terms of increasing CYP3A activity by a median factor of 1.25 
(midazolam as substrate) and decreasing the activity of CYP1A2 (caffeine as substrate) and CYP2D6 
(metoprolol as substrate) by median factors of 0.73 and 0.83, respectively. These effects were not 
thought to have clinical significance but the applicant states that it is appropriate to exercise caution 
when administering DHA concomitantly with CYP1A2 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. 
theophylline).   
Regarding the possible effects of other drugs on DHA and PQ:  
 
PQ clearance may be reduced by concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors such as NNRTIs 
(delavirdine, efavirenz), protease inhibitors (amprenavir, indinavir), calcium channel blockers 
(diltiazem), H2-receptor antagonists (cimetidine), hormonal contraceptives (gestodene, 
ethyloestradiol) or grapefruit juice. 
Assessment Report  
EMA/739355/2011  
Page 46/129
 
 
 
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
PQ clearance may be increased by CYP3A4 inducers including the NNRTI nevirapine, anticonvulsant 
and antiepileptic agents (carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin), antibacterial agents 
(rifampicin, rifabutin, rifapentine), glucocorticoids and St. John’s wort. However, since the PQ half-
life is >20 days and most of the drug is rapidly distributed to tissues rather than circulating in the 
blood an alteration in its clearance would affect mostly the terminal phase when concentrations are 
very low. In addition, while PQ pharmacokinetics might be affected by the listed drugs the 
applicant does not expect clinically relevant implications and has not proposed specific SmPC text 
on this topic. 
  Declining concentrations of DHA and its pro-drug artesunate have been reported after multiple 
administrations to healthy volunteers and subjects with acute malaria but the mechanism behind 
self-induction is unknown. It has been reported that systemic exposure (AUC0-∞) was not 
statistically significantly reduced over a 3-day treatment period and there is currently no evidence 
of impaired efficacy due to this phenomenon. 
 
The applicant considers it is unlikely that inhibitors of UGT1A9 would increase DHA plasma 
concentrations, in fact DHA is possibly metabolised also by UGT2B7. Inducers of UGT enzymes like 
phenobarbital might decrease DHA plasma concentrations. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The applicant did not conduct studies but quoted published data on what is known about the 
mechanism of action of the active substances.  Details are noted in section “Primary 
pharmacodynamics”. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamics.  
The endoperoxide bridge construct in the artemisinins is thought to be essential for their anti-malarial 
activity, causing free-radical damage to parasite membrane systems. Specific actions include: 
 
 
 
Inhibition of falciparum sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 
Interference with mitochondrial electron transport 
Interference with parasite transport proteins 
  Disruption of parasite mitochondrial function. 
In addition, the artemisinins may reduce gametocyte carriage and the transmissibility of malaria, 
which could contribute to malaria control in areas of low endemicity. 
Piperaquine acts through the chemical inhibition of parasite haem detoxification and has a prolonged 
duration of action because of its very long half life. 
In a three-day ACT regimen, the artemisinin component is present in the body during only two asexual 
parasite life-cycles for P. falciparum. While three days of artemisinin treatment greatly reduces the 
number of parasites in the body complete clearance is dependent on the partner medicine persisting at 
parasiticidal concentrations until all infecting parasites have been killed. Thus the partner compounds 
in ACT regimens need to be relatively slowly eliminated. In Eurartesim the applicant claims that DHA is 
Assessment Report  
EMA/739355/2011  
Page 47/129
 
 
 
“protected” from resistance by PQP provided it is present at efficacious levels and that PQP is partly 
protected by DHA. Courses of one or two days of ACT are not recommended because they are less 
efficacious and provide less protection for the slowly eliminated partner drug (WHO 2006).  
The relationship between plasma concentration and effect has not been assessed. Since the activity of 
the antimalarials is not exerted in plasma and since erythrocyte sequestration changes as the parasite 
load changes so investigations of effect related to plasma levels is not expected to be fruitful. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic effects  
The past experience and published data on the potential neurotoxic effects of DHA and the QT 
prolongation potential of DHA and PQP received particular attention during the clinical trial programme. 
Neurotoxicity of artemisinins 
In the Phase I/II studies no specific effects on neurological examinations were detected. There has 
been controversy regarding the neurotoxicity of artemisinin derivatives in man and animals. The 
potential for neurotoxicity in animals seems to be related to the dose, the route of administration and 
the PK properties of the different artemisinins (i.e. DHA and its pro-drugs). Sustained CNS exposure 
from slowly absorbed or eliminated artemisinins was shown to be more neurotoxic than intermittent 
brief exposure. 
Thus, the oil-based derivatives that are given IM, such as artemether and arteether, appear to be 
more neurotoxic than the derivatives that are given orally or intravenously. The potential for 
neurotoxicity to occur in man with orally administered DHA (the active metabolite of all derivatives of 
the artemisinin class) was concluded to be low given its rapid clearance and use in a 3-day regimen.  
QT prolongation by artemisinins 
Various studies in animals with different artemisinins have shown a potential to cause prolongation of 
QTc intervals. Other changes in ECGs have been noted under some experimental conditions. PQ-
associated AV block and prolongation of the PR and QRS durations have all been observed. The 
applicant conducted a study to compare the effects of PQ, chloroquine (CQ) and mefloquine on hERG 
tail current. Exposure to these agents reduced hERG residual tail current in a dose related manner and 
the dose response curves gave IC50 values of 5.28, 4.03 and 19.88 μM, respectively. Hence CQ and 
PQ have nearly identical hERG IC50 values.  
During the procedure the applicant performed study DM09-006 on QTc prolongation. ECG manual 
readings performed by CardiaBase (Nancy, France) were to be made under blind conditions. The study 
initially planned to include 208 healthy subjects as follows: 
Group 1 (64 subjects):  Eurartesim at the standard dose after a high-fat/low-kcal (400 kcal) meal  
3 doses over three days, each of 3 or 4 tablets by body weight 
Eurartesim placebo on D-1 
Group 2 (64 subjects):  Riamet (arthemeter/ lumefantrine) at the standard dose, each dose after high 
fat/low kcal (400 kcal) meal 
6 doses over three days, each of 4 tablets in the morning and evening; 
Eurartesim placebo on D-2 
Group 3 (40 subjects):  Placebo (matching Eurartesim) after a high-fat/low-kcal (400 kcal) meal

Doses as in Group 1 but after a high-fat/high-kcal meal; 
Eurartesim placebo on D-1 
After conducting an interim analysis on the first four groups it was planned to enrol two additional 
groups (5 and 6) as follows: 
Group 5 (40 subjects) 
Subjects took 3 or 4 tablets (according to weight </> 75 kg) of placebo on Day -1 and 3 or 4 tablets of 
Eurartesim once daily from Day 1 to Day 3 with intervals of 24 ± 0.5 h. Dosing was each morning at 
around 08:00 a.m. with water and without any food intake. Dosing was followed at 3 h by breakfast 
and at 6 h by lunch with a standard dinner around 08:30 p.m. 
Group 6 (20 subjects) 
Subjects took 3 or 4 tablets of placebo once daily from Day -1 to Day 3 and then 400 mg moxifloxacin 
on Day 4. Other dosing features were as for Group 5 except that moxifloxacin was given after a high-
fat/low-Kcal meal. 
For Groups 3 and 6 the largest mean effects of moxifloxacin on QTcF (Fridericia calculation method) 
were reported at 4 and 6 h post-dose. The lower 90% CI were 12.5 and 13.3 ms and so assay 
sensitivity was demonstrated. 
Table 21: 
Assay sensitivity (QTcF) – Maximum effect 
Based on uncorrected QT data the comparisons with respective placebo groups were as shown in the 
figure and as follows: 
  Group 1 (Eurartesim high-fat/low-Kcal) vs. placebo (group 3) 39.3 ms (p < 0.0001) 
  Group 2 (Riamet) vs. placebo (group 3) 5.8 ms (p = 0.0065) 
  Group 4 (Eurartesim high-fat/high-Kcal) vs. placebo (group 3) 38.9 ms (p < 0.0001) 
  Group 5 (Eurartesim fasting) vs. placebo (group 3) 21.2 ms (p < 0.0001)

Figure 9: 
Estimate of treatments effect over time on time-matched changes in QT (ms) 
– Triplicate ECG analysis set 
In the placebo groups the mean maximum time-matched changes in QTcF were 10.6 ms for Group 3 
and 12.8 ms for Group 6 while CV% appeared to be slightly lower for Group 6 (53% vs. 63%). 
The contrast between estimated means of the maximum time-matched changes from baseline in QTcF 
between Group 1 (Eurartesim high-fat/low-Kcal) and Group 5 (Eurartesim fasting) was 12.6 ms with 
lower 95% CI 7.4 ms. Thus dosing in the fasting state had a lesser effect on QTcF.  
Consequently while the comparison between Group 4 (Eurartesim high-fat/high-Kcal) and Group 2 
(Riamet) was 36.1 ms, the difference was reduced to 13.4 ms (95% CI [-17.1; -9.7]) between Group 
5 (Eurartesim fasting) and Group 2 (Riamet). Also, the contrast of the estimated means of the 
maximum time-matched changes from baseline in QTcF between Group 5 (Eurartesim fasting) and 
Group 6 (placebo) was 21.0 ms (95% CI [15.7; 26.4]). However, this still exceeded the difference 
observed on comparing Group 2 (Riamet) and Group 3 (placebo), which was 9.9 ms (95% CI [6.8; 
12.9]). 
As shown in the table below all the comparisons between treatments were statistically significant. The 
p-values were always < 0.0001 except for the comparison between Group 1 (Eurartesim high-fat/low-
Kcal) and Group 4 (Eurartesim high-fat/high-Kcal) for which the p-value was 0.0025. 
Stratification by body weight (i.e. comparing the subjects below or above 75 kg) did not change 
significantly the results. No significant interaction between body weight and treatment was detected 
and the estimates of treatment effects adjusted for body weight were consistent with those previously 
obtained.

A statistical difference between genders across treatments was detected. Also, the effect of Riamet on 
QTc prolongation was nearly doubled in female vs. male subjects (maximum time-matched changes in 
QTcF of 7.9 ms in male and 13.1 ms in female subjects).

For the comparisons of the time-averaged time-matched changes in QTcF, these were: 
  Group 1 (Eurartesim high-fat/low-Kcal) vs. Group 2 (Riamet) = 21.8 ms (LL 95% CI 19.1 ms) 
  Group 4 (Eurartesim high-fat/high-Kcal) vs. Group 2 (Riamet) = 27.5 ms 
  Group 5 (Eurartesim fasting) vs. Group 2 (Riamet) = 12.5 ms 
The duration of a contrast > 20 ms was shorter for Group 5 compared to Groups 1 and 4 but the 
median times of occurrence of the maximum time-matched changes were roughly comparable for the 
three Eurartesim Groups (5 to 7.5 h post-dose) but 7-8 h post-dose for placebo and 11.5 h for Riamet. 
With regard to the analysis of late ECGs at Day 4 (corresponding to 36 h post-dose) QTcF mean 
changes from baseline were all < 20 ms and varied from 15.9 ms (Group 1) to 12.2 ms (Riamet). At 
120 h post dose all changes were between 3.4 and 5.5 milliseconds. Similar observations applied to 
the QTcB and QTcP datasets. 
Corresponding analyses were performed for the QTcB (Bazett calculation method) and QTcP datasets. 
The categorical analysis of QTcF, QTcB and QTcP demonstrated that no subjects had QTc values above 
450 ms in the two placebo groups. In the Riamet group one subject had a QTc value between 450 and 
480 ms, regardless of the corrective method, and another subject had only a QTcB value between 480 
and 500 ms. In the Eurartesim groups 23.4% (15/64) in Group 1 had maximum QTcF values above 
450 ms and 10.0% (4/40) in Group 5. No values above 500 ms were recorded throughout the study.  
There were no changes from baseline in QTcF values that exceeded 30 ms in the two placebo groups 
and 7.8% (5/64) in the Riamet group had such a change. In contrast the Eurartesim groups included 
89% (5764) in Group 1 and 95% (38/64) in Group 4 with changes > 30 ms compared to 65% (26/40) 
of subjects who were dosed in the fasting state.  
The contrast of the estimated means of the maximum time-matched changes in RR between Groups 1 
and 4 vs. Group 3 (placebo) were 61.8 ms and 48.1 ms, respectively, while the contrast between 
Group 5 (Eurartesim fasting) and Group 6 (placebo) was 24.3 ms. However, the differences between 
the three Eurartesim groups and the Riamet group were 76.3 ms, 62.6 ms and 70.6 ms, respectively. 
A similar pattern of observations applied to the estimated time-averaged time-matched changes in RR. 
The estimated means of the maximum time-matched changes from baseline in HR showed only small 
actual differences between groups. Nevertheless several of the comparisons made reached significance 
as shown in the table below and the figure suggests that in comparison to placebo HR tended to be 
higher with Riamet and lower with Eurartesim regardless of the dosing conditions. 
The comparisons in maximum time-matched changes in PR revealed no statistically significant 
differences between the treatments. Similarly, the analysis of the maximum time-matched changes in 
QRS showed no statistically significant differences were observed between the treatments. 
A correlation analysis for QTcF values and PQ PK parameters considered the following variables: 
  QTcF maximum time-matched changes from baseline to Day 3 and the values of Cmax and AUC0-
24 at Day 3 within study DM09-006 (low and high/kcal meal) 
  QTcF changes from Day 0 (h 0) to Day 2 (h 0) and the values of Cmax and AUC0-24 at Day 1, 
combining the data of study DM09-006 (low and high/kcal meal) and study DM04-009 (fasting 
conditions) 
The results obtained for Cmax and AUC0-24 were closely comparable with a slightly stronger 
correlation for the latter. In the figure below the AUC0-24 values for subjects with malaria in study 
DM04-009 (Part a of the figure; Eurartesim without concomitant food) and subjects enrolled in study

DM09-008 (Part b of the figure; Eurartesim under fasting conditions) have been projected along the 
QTcF/PK regression line estimated within study DM09-006.  
The AUC0-24 values for studies DM04-009 and DM09-008 were available only for Day 1. Therefore, 
these values were multiplied by a conversion factor of three to obtain exposure parameters for Day 3. 
The conversion factor was estimated after pooling data from all available PK studies and was deemed 
to be conservative because it tended to overestimate Day 3 plasma exposure.

From these figures the applicant concluded that: 
 
There is a statistically significant correlation between the peak values of QTcF changes from 
baseline and PQ AUC0-24 within DM09-006 (correlation coefficient equal to 0.60; p<0.0001).  
  On average, the predicted maximum QTcF time-matched changes for subjects taking Eurartesim 
under fasting conditions or without concomitant food are lower than the observed QTcF changes for 
subjects taking Eurartesim in fed conditions. 
  Approximately 75% of the predicted maximum QTcF time-matched changes from baseline for the 
subjects taking Eurartesim under fasting conditions or without concomitant food are located in an 
area of the regression line where the upper prediction boundary is below 60 ms. The remaining 
patients/subjects (approximately 25%) have AUC0-24 values compatible with a predicted 
maximum QTcF time-matched change from baseline potentially higher than 60 ms. 
 
The plots for healthy subjects and those with malaria appear to be super-imposable. 
The results shown in the next figure show a trend that is comparable to that in the previous analyses 
although to a lesser degree. The applicant points out that the limitation of this analysis is the QTcF 
change from D0 to D2, which measures the effect of Eurartesim after 12 h from the last treatment 
intake.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of PQP were characterised by a slow absorption process (its absorption being 
influenced by food) and a very long half life of about 22 days. The long half-life is mainly due to the 
very large volume of distribution observed in patients. PQP is poorly and very slowly metabolised in 
humans. 
The pharmacokinetics of DHA were characterised by rapid absorption and elimination. DHA volume of 
distribution was quite low; it is known that DHA accumulates in erythrocytes. DHA was cleared mainly 
by phase II metabolism to the glucuronide which was the main metabolite observed in vitro and in 
vivo.  
PQP undergoes enterohepatic recirculation and its absorption was influenced by food intake.  
The effect of food on DHA absorption was investigated in a food interaction study to evaluate the effect 
of food on both DHA and PQ after a single oral dose of Eurartesim in healthy male volunteers having a 
body weight ≥75kg (ST3073 ST3074-DM09-008).  A food effect for Eurartesim was found for both DHA 
and PQP, on comparing the pharmacokinetic parameters administration following a high fat meal 
compared with administration in the fasted state. This was clinically significant for PQP only. 
Comparing the PQP pharmacokinetic parameters observed in this study and in adult patients, the 
administration of Eurartesim without food is suggested, avoiding the overexposure caused by 
concomitant food effect.  The safety implications of different dosing conditions became apparent 
following results obtained in newly conducted trial DM09-006, which showed a significant QTcF interval 
prolongation effect compared to comparator (Riamet).  This effect appeared to be emphasised by the 
concomitant intake of Eurartesim with food which in turn increases the plasma concentration of PQP 
The effect of concomitant administration of Eurartesim and known CYP3A4 inhibitors has not yet been 
studied. In clinical trials conducted by the applicant, no difference in the safety profile of Eurartesim 
became apparent in patients taking antibacterials, antimycotics and antivirals, when compared to 
patients not exposed to these drugs. Nevertheless, the applicant has committed to perform three drug-
drug interaction studies with Eurartesim and other drugs that are metabolized via CYP 3A4 
(clarithromycin, midazolam) and an oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel). These 
studies are listed in the pharmacovigilance plan. 
Data is currently missing from certain populations, including the European malaria patient population 
and in particular Caucasian malaria patients. In healthy volunteer studies, 258 Caucasian subjects 
were exposed to Eurartesim to date. Results from study ST3073/ST3074- DM09-007 revealed there 
were no differences in PK between healthy Caucasian and healthy Asian volunteers. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Data have shown that Eurartesim has a QT prolongation effect, especially if taken with food.  Hence, 
QTc prolongation is an identified important safety risk stated in the RMP.  To minimise the potential 
risk of cardiac arrhythmias, Eurartesim is contraindicated in patients who might be at particular risk of 
developing cardiac arrhythmias.  Additional risk minimisation measures are planned in this regard 
(educational outreach programme to health care workers). 
Neurotoxicity, albeit unlikely with orally administered DHA, is a potential concern flagged in the Risk 
Management Plan (RMP).

Missing data relate to some special populations and to drug interaction with CYP 3A4 metabolised 
drugs / other antimalarial medicines.  These concerns are noted in the RMP. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy

There were no dose-finding studies. The dose ratio of DHA and PQP and the dose regimen used for 
adults and children in the two pivotal Phase III studies were selected based on previous published 
studies.

integrity and regulatory acceptability of the programme and comprised one representative from 
Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV), two from Sigma-Tau and the Co-ordinating Investigators of each 
of the two Phase III studies.

Study DM040010 (Asia study) 
A Phase III, Randomised, Non-Inferiority Trial, to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of 
Dihydroartemisinin/Piperaquine (DHA/PQP, Artekin™) in Comparison with Artesunate + 
Mefloquine (AS+MQ) in Patients Affected by Acute, Uncomplicated P. falciparum Malaria 
Methods 
This was a multi-centre, randomised, open label, two-arm parallel group study to determine whether 
DHA/PQP was non-inferior to AS+MQ and to assess its safety and tolerability in Asian patients (adults 
and children) with acute uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. DM 040010 was conducted between 
June 24 2005 and 7 April 2007 at 10 study sites spread across India (3), Laos (2) and Thailand (5). 
Study Participants  
DM 040010 was to enrol subjects aged between 3 months and 65 years (excluding pregnant or 
lactating women) of body weight ≥ 5 kg who had microscopically confirmed mono-infection with P. 
falciparum (parasitaemia 80 - 200,000/μL) or mixed infection in which the P. falciparum component 
was to be 80-200,000/μL. They were also to have a history of fever or presence of fever (temperature 
≥ 37.5°C). 
Depending upon local practice, patients were admitted to hospital for either three or seven days and 
then followed up as out-patients or all study visits were conducted as out-patients. The study report 
states that the design of the study followed the 2003 WHO guidance regarding the minimum durations 
of follow up according to local transmission.  The study used the WHO-recommended follow-up periods 
for regimens involving MQ (63 days) to accommodate the half-life. In addition, molecular genotyping 
using PCR technology was used to distinguish between recrudescence and new infections and parasite 
clearance was assessed from thick and thin blood smears. 
Treatments 
Subjects were randomised to DHA/PQP or comparator AS/MQ (Artequin).  
Artequin was manufactured by Mepha, Switzerland. 
  DHA/PQP and AS were each given orally once daily for three days. The daily dose of AS was 4 
mg/kg/day which equated to four 50 mg tablets/day for a 50 kg person or 4 ml/day of a 10 mg/mL 
suspension (actually given as crushed or dissolved tablets in water) for a 10 kg child. 
  MQ was given once daily with AS on the second and third day of AS dosing. The dose of MQ was 
25 mg/kg divided into two doses, which equated to a total of five 250 mg tablets for a 50 kg 
person or 5 mL of a 50 mg/mL suspension (dissolved tablets in water) for a 10 kg child. 
Doses were calculated by body weight as shown in the table below.

Dosing was with water and without regard to last food intake. Patients were observed for one hour 
after dosing to ensure that the medication was not vomited or spat out. If the dose was vomited within 
30 minutes of dosing, a further full dose was given. If the dose was vomited between 31 and 60 
minutes after dosing, a further half dose was given. Patients who vomited twice were withdrawn. 
During the study the following treatments were forbidden: 
  Any other anti-malarial treatment. 
  Antibacterial agents with antimalarial activity (e.g. erythromycin or other macrolides, co-
trimoxazole or other sulfonamides, any tetracycline, quinolones, clindamycin).  
Patients were withdrawn from the study if any of the above drugs were taken. 
Chloroquine was allowed for the treatment of non-falciparum infections occurring during follow up.  
Parents and parents/guardians were discouraged from obtaining drugs from private pharmacies or 
physicians. 
Rescue Treatments 
Patients with treatment failure were withdrawn from the study, treated and followed up as per local 
practice. They did not have to undergo efficacy evaluation thereafter. Patients requiring rescue therapy 
were treated with AS 2 mg/kg/day orally for seven days plus doxycycline (if there was no 
contraindication) in accordance with the recommended second-line antimalarial treatment in the WHO 
2006 treatment guideline. Any patient diagnosed with severe malaria or danger signs during follow-up 
was referred for treatment with parenteral artesunate and supportive measures at the local facility or 
hospital. 
Objectives 
The study aimed to demonstrate that the PCR-corrected cure rate of DHA/PQP was non-inferior to that 
of the comparator. This cure rate was defined as the proportion of patients with adequate clinical and 
parasitological response (ACPR) at Day 63 plus those treatment failures (TFs) identified as new P. 
falciparum (by PCR) and non-falciparum infections. 
In order to compare the study results with the historical ones, the criteria described by WHO (2003) 
were used. These failure rates computed in each treatment group were judged against the efficacy 
threshold of 90% (WHO 2006). An efficacy threshold of <90%, obtained in an analysis carried out in 
accordance with the WHO requirements, indicates that a treatment should not be considered for first-
line treatment policy.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Thick and thin Giemsa stained blood smears were obtained to verify the presence of P. falciparum and 
to calculate asexual and sexual parasite density. Films were examined at the study site with a 
binocular light microscope under oil immersion at 1000x magnification. At least 100 thick film fields 
were examined. Counting was based on at least 200 leucocytes on the thick blood film according to 
WHO standards. The parasite density was calculated according to standard formulae. 
Blood smears were collected using kits provided by MDS and a proportion was randomly chosen for QC 
testing. However, errors at MDS resulted in its replacement by Muhimbili University of Health and 
Allied Sciences, Department of Parasitology & Medical Entomology, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania. The Data 
Monitoring Committee (DMC) was responsible for evaluating the findings. 
PCR was used to genotype P. falciparum at the Prince Leopold Institute of Tropical Medicine (ITM) in 
Antwerp, Belgium. The QC plan was for 20% to be re-analysed at the MDS Central Laboratory in 
Beijing but this laboratory did not use the same procedures and therefore the SMRU in Thailand was 
appointed instead. All PCR gels were also read by an independent expert (Paris). The DMC was 
responsible for providing a critical evaluation of the findings. 
The study aimed to demonstrate that the PCR-corrected cure rate of DHA/PQP was non-inferior to 
that of the comparator. This cure rate was defined as the proportion of patients with adequate clinical 
and parasitological response (ACPR) at Day 63 plus those treatment failures (TFs) identified as new P. 
falciparum (by PCR) and non-falciparum infections. 
ACPR was defined as absence of parasitaemia through to Day 63 irrespective of temperature and not 
meeting any of the criteria for early treatment failure (ETF) or late clinical (LCF) or parasitological 
failure (LPF). TF was defined as the sum of early and late TFs (ETF+LTF). 
ETF was defined as: 
1.  Development of danger signs or severe malaria on Days 0, 1, 2 or 3, in the presence of 
parasitaemia. 
2.  Parasite density on Day 2 > Day 0 count, irrespective of temperature. 
3.  Presence of parasitaemia on Day 3 with fever (temperature ≥37.5°C). 
4.  Parasitaemia on Day 3 ≥25 % of count on Day 0. 
LTF could be due to Late Clinical Failure (LCF) or Late Parasitological Failure (LPF): 
LCF was defined as: 
1.  Development of danger signs or severe malaria after Day 3 in the presence of parasitaemia. 
2.  Presence of parasitaemia and fever on any day from Day 4 to Day 63, without previously meeting 
the criteria of ETF or LCF. 
LPF was defined as reappearance of parasitaemia after initial clearance between Day 7 and Day 63 
(identified as recrudescent infection by PCR analysis) in the absence of fever (temperature <37.5°C) 
without previously meeting the criteria of ETF or LCF. 
According to the protocol, efficacy analyses were to be performed on the pure Intention-To-Treat 
(pure-ITT; all treated), modified ITT (m-ITT; pure-ITT population with the exclusion of those patients 
lost-to-follow up for unknown reasons before Day 63) and the Per Protocol (PP; pure-ITT with no major 
protocol violations) populations. The m-ITT and the PP populations were the co-primary populations

Sample size 
The sample size was initially computed using the original formulation of the primary objective (with 
two co-primary objectives) which required a simulation. From this simulation it was concluded that if 
the PCR-corrected cure rate at Day 63 in the ITT population was in the range of 92-95% for AS+MQ, a 
sample size of 350 patients in the AS+MQ arm and 700 patients in the DHA/PQP arm (1050 patients in 
total) was needed. With the third protocol amendment a new formulation of the sample size 
requirement was written.  
Randomisation 
A randomisation list was generated before the study started. Treatment allocation was concealed until 
the subject had completed the screening procedures and was deemed eligible for the study. The 
treatment allocation was contained in a sealed envelope. A procedure was established for opening a 
sealed envelope.  
Subjects were randomised to either DHA/PQP or AS+MQ in a 2:1 ratio 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a randomised open label study. The study used an open label design because of the 
complexity of establishing a double-blind dosing schedule involving placebo tablets of DHA/PQP and 
placebo tablets of AS+MQ. Procedures to minimise bias in the treatment comparison, especially to 
reduce the investigator’s bias and the bias in the assessment of the primary endpoint are described.  
All decisions pertaining to the allocation of patients to various analysis populations and the assessment 
of the primary endpoint were conducted in blinded conditions and without knowledge of the PCR 
results.  
Statistical methods 
The lower limit of the one-sided 97.5% confidence interval (CI; = lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI) 
for the treatment difference in the percentage of PCR-corrected cure rates (ACPR) at Day 63 was 
computed. In order to confirm non-inferiority of DHA/PQP versus the comparator the CI lower limit was 
to be >-0.05 (i.e. within -5%) in both the m-ITT and the PP populations.  
The PCR-corrected cure rates at Day 63 were to be described by country. The Breslow-Day test (if 
each country has at least two failures for each treatment) or logistic regression (otherwise) were to be 
used to evaluate homogeneity across countries. A similar approach was taken to analysis of outcomes 
by age groups. 
A range of sensitivity analyses was pre-defined. These included analyses in which: 
  All patients with missing parasitaemia were treated as failures 
  All patients with new infections as detected by PCR were excluded from the analysis (this analysis 
was added post hoc) following the suggestion of the study investigators.

Conduct of the study 
Overall there were four (stated in the study report but five actually listed) general protocol 
amendments, one country-specific protocol amendment for India and one site-specific amendment for 
SMRU in Thailand. Other changes in the study conduct versus the protocol were found a posteriori. 
These included lack of standardisation of randomisation procedure, missed visit assessments, slight 
changes in the definition of parasite clearance and in the lay-out of the mock tables/listings and the 
addition of some statistical analyses not planned in the SAP.  
General Protocol Amendments 
The final protocol (10 January 2005) was amended twice before and three times after enrolment had 
started. The three amendments after enrolment had started were as follows: 
24 November 2005  
The DMC advised harmonising the statistical approaches for the two Phase III studies. In addition, the 
DMC had concerns about the co-primary endpoint the cure rate of DHA/PQP must be at least 90% and 
considered that it was necessary to distinguish between the two objectives of proving non-inferiority 
and of comparing the results with historical ones. As a consequence power was recalculated for each 
objective separately. 
For the Non-Inferiority Analyses 
The clinical and statistical specifications for the sample size computations were as follows: 
 
 
Primary endpoint = PCR corrected cure rate at Day 63 
Primary analysis = based on 97.5% one-sided CIs for the difference in cure rates 
  Alpha = 0.025 (one-sided) 
 
Power = 80% (for a null hypothesis of a treatment difference worse than -5% and an alternative 
hypothesis of 0 difference between treatments) 
 
PCR-corrected cure rate of DHA/PQP and AS+MQ in the pure-ITT population at Day 63 = at least 
92% 
  Non-inferiority margin for the difference (test-reference) = -0.05 (equivalent to -5%) 
  Randomisation: based on a 2:1 allocation scheme (test vs. reference). 
  Rate of patient attrition in the m-ITT population compared to pure-ITT (i.e. rate of non-informative 
withdrawals) = 5%. Expected 63 day PCR corrected cure rate in mITT = 93%. 
Assessment Report  
EMA/739355/2011  
Page 64/129
 
 
 
 
  Rate of patient attrition in the PP population compared with the ITT population (i.e. rate of 
withdrawals for any reason and protocol violations) = 20%. Expected 63 day PCR corrected cure 
rate in this population = 95% 
 
Primary analysis populations = both the m-ITT and the PP populations. 
With these assumptions the sample size of 1050 patients (700 DHA/PQP and 350 AS+MQ) provided a 
power of approximately 80% for the lower bound of a 97.5 one-sided CI for the treatment difference 
being above -0.05 in the m-ITT and 84% for the same analysis in the PP population (for the power 
calculation both continuity correction and the inequality of variances under the null hypothesis were 
considered). 
For the Historical Comparisons 
A secondary objective of the study was that of estimating the failure rates within each treatment group 
in accordance with WHO criteria. The clinical and statistical specifications for the sample size 
computations for this analysis were as follows: 
  Anticipated population proportion of clinical failures = as high as 10% 
  Confidence level = 95% (two-sided interval) 
 
Precision = 5 percentage points. 
  Rate of patient attrition in the PP population as compared to the ITT population (i.e. rate of 
withdrawals for any reason and protocol violations) = 20%. 
According to WHO (2003) a sample size of at least 175 patients would be required in each treatment 
group for estimating the proportion of clinical failures to within a 5 percentage point of the true value 
with 95% confidence. 
This amendment also acknowledged that: 
  China would not be participating. 
 
 
 
The number of sites in Laos would increase from one to two. 
There would be no stratification by age in the study. 
Persistent vomiting occurring on any day, not just Day 0, was a withdrawal criterion. 
13 September 2006 
This was required because delays in obtaining Thai regulatory approval for two of the five centres 
resulted in patients being recruited over two malaria seasons. Thus it was necessary to add testing for 
any cohort effect to the statistics section. 
27 December 2006 
This was required to increase the total number of patients to be recruited to from 1050 to 1150 (767 
DHA/PQP, 383 AS+MQ) to fulfil an Indian regulatory requirement to ensure that at least 100 patients 
recruited from Indian sites were exposed to DHA/PQP. 
Thailand SMRU  
This protocol amendment (6 January 2006) was required because the Thai MoPH EC did not want 
children to be recruited to the study: only adults aged ≥18 years could be included. 
India Country Specific 
Assessment Report  
EMA/739355/2011  
Page 65/129
 
 
 
This protocol amendment (21 April 2006) was required in order to accommodate local practices as 
follows: 
  Recruitment restricted to adults aged ≥ 18 years. 
 
Prohibition of chloroquine during the study because it was still effective against P. falciparum in 
some regions of India. 
Baseline data 
Approximately 75% of the study population was male, all were Asian, the mean age was approximately 
25 years and the mean body weight was 44 kg. In Laos the means were lower because both adults and 
children were recruited to the study while only adults were enrolled in India and few children were 
recruited in Thailand before the implementation of a protocol amendment restricting the study to 
adults. In Laos approximately 60% were male compared with approximately 80% in India and 
Thailand. 
Geometric mean baseline parasite density was slightly higher in the AS+MQ treatment group compared 
with the DHA/PQP group in all study populations. Baseline parasite density also varied between 
countries, with the highest densities occurring in Laos and the lowest densities occurring in India.

Outcomes and estimation 
In the primary analysis the comparisons of PCR-corrected and uncorrected cure rates resulted in 
97.5% CI within -3.1%, with and without continuity corrections. The differences between uncorrected 
cure rates were statistically significant in the m-ITT (p = 0.006) and PP populations (p=0.002) in 
favour of Eurartesim and the one-sided 97.5% CI exceeded zero for all comparisons of uncorrected 
cure rates.

Table 27: 
Summary of Cure Rates at Day 63 – (All Populations) 
The effects of implementing the various pre-planned input strategies for patients who were lost-to-
follow-up and patients without a valid PCR result (pure-ITT population) gave PCR-corrected cure rates 
that ranged from 90.55 - 97.25% for the DHA/PQP group and from 89.24 - 96.33% for the AS+MQ 
group. For all strategies, the 97.5% one-sided CI was within -5%. 
The sensitivity analysis in which patients with missing parasitaemia results were classified as TFs 
resulted in a difference in PCR-corrected cure rate between treatments that was not statistically 
significant. The 97.5% one-sided CI was within -5% in the m-ITT and PP populations. The difference 
between the treatment uncorrected cure rates was statistically significant but the cure rates were 
lower. 
Excluding patients with new infection detected by PCR reduced the PCR-corrected cure rates but the 
97.5% one-sided CI was within -5% in all populations. There was a higher proportion of new infections 
in the AS+MQ group compared with the DHA/PQP group. 
Rates of recrudescent infections were low. In the m-ITT, the proportion of patients classified as 
recrudescence because of withdrawal or TF before Day 4 was 1.1% in the DHA/PQP group and 0.8% in 
the AS+MQ group. In the PP population the proportions with new P. falciparum infections were 
comparable between treatments but the proportions with infections due to other plasmodia were 
12.9% in the DHA/PQP group compared to 19.3% in the AS+MQ group.

Day 63 – AS+MQ (All Populations) 
The minimum age was 6 months and very few children aged < 2 years were enrolled. The pure-ITT 
population results showed a decrease in PCR-corrected rates with increasing age (to < 90% for 
subjects aged 12 years or more) as shown below. In the m-ITT and PP populations, when stratified by 
age, there was no statistically significant difference in the PCR-corrected cure rates between 
treatments.  
In the pure-ITT population shown below (p = 0.022) and in the m-ITT and PP populations (p = 0.013 
for both) a statistically significant difference in the uncorrected cure rates was seen between 
treatments in the 18-65 year age group with higher rates for DHA/PQP and one-sided 97.5% CI above 
zero. This difference is stated to be due to more recrudescent infections and other plasmodial 
infections in the AS+MQ group than in the DHA/PQP group. In each population the uncorrected cure 
rates for both treatments in patients aged 18-65 years were lower than those seen in patients aged 
<18 years, suggesting that they had more new infections than patients aged <18 years.

Table 30: 
Summary of Cure Rates at Day 63 – by Age Classification (All Populations) 
The difference between the PCR-corrected cure rates in Asian adults and adolescents vs. younger 
patients in the Pure ITT population (which was apparent in both treatment groups) were accounted for 
by the higher rates of LFU and missing PCR results. Subjects LFU and with missing PCR occurred more 
often in some countries and because of the different age ranges enrolled the effect appeared to be 
age-dependent when in fact it was a country-dependent effect. No significant effect of weight was 
detected. 
There were differences between the uncorrected cure rates in adults vs. younger subjects in all 
analysis populations and such differences were apparent in both treatment groups. Within the 
DHA/PQP group these differences were not explained by age itself but by country and body weight.  
 
The applicant considered that the country effect could be explained by the variable transmission 
rates in different geographical areas.  
 
The applicant acknowledged that body weight appeared to have a role in predicting uncorrected 
cure rates that is independent of country but stressed that the differences by class of body weight 
still supported the efficacy of DHA/PQP vs. the comparator. On this basis the applicant considered 
that the data supported a dose adjustment according to body weight. 
The PCR-corrected and uncorrected cure rates showed some variations between countries for each 
treatment. Within each country all rates were either comparable or slightly higher in the DHA/PQP 
group versus the AS+MQ group. The 97.5% one-sided CI for the difference (DHA/PQP-AS+MQ) in PCR-
corrected cure rate adjusted by country was -0.84% in the m-ITT and -0.39% in the PP population.

Table 31: 
Summary of Cure Rates (ACPR) at Day 63 by Country (All Populations) 
Cure rates at Day 63 by country when non-interpretable, missing or not done PCRs were treated as 
either failures, successes or led to the exclusion of the corresponding patients showed the largest 
effect in Thailand. However, in each case the PCR-corrected and uncorrected cure rates for the m-ITT 
population were statistically homogeneous across countries and the 97.5% one-sided CI for the 
differences were within -5%. 
In the Pure ITT population the overall PCR-corrected cure rates for DHA/PQP and for AS+MQ in India 
and Thailand were lower than corresponding rates for Laos. This was not observed in the other analysis 
populations. The applicant stated that the findings in the two treatment groups mainly reflected:  
 
LFU rates: no Laotian subject was LFU compared to 15% of Indian and 5% of Thai subjects 
(regardless of treatment group) 
  Missing PCR results: 0-3% in India, 7-8% in Thailand vs. only one patient in Laos 
The PCR-corrected cure rates for India appeared to decrease with age and body weight but weight was 
not found to be statistically significant in a logistic model based on the probability of cure that was 
applied to Pure ITT subjects in the DHA/PQP group. 
The country-specific uncorrected cure rates appeared to decrease with increasing age in India and 
Thailand but there was little or no such effect in Laos. A trend for lower uncorrected cure rates with 
increasing weight was most apparent in India, was less consistent in Thailand and there was no clear 
trend in Laos. In a logistic model based on the probability to be cured in the DHA/PQP group the 
weight factor was found to be statistically significant in all analysis populations whereas the age factor 
was found to be statistically significant only in the Pure ITT population. 
The proportions of patients with malaria due to other plasmodium species were similar between 
treatment groups. The proportions with new infections at Thai centres 12, 18 and 19 were lower than 
observed at all other centres, which suggested a lower malaria transmission rate although it should be 
noted that some new infections might have been missed because parasite density was not measured 
on Days 35, 49 or 56 at these three centres. 
In addition, the uncorrected cure rates in the m-ITT and PP populations at centres 21 and 22 in 
Thailand were much lower than those seen at other centres. In the m-ITT population the uncorrected 
cure rates at centre 21 were 45.4% (DHA/PQP) vs. 31.3% (AS+MQ) and at centre 22 they were 
43.7% (DHA/PQP) vs. 28.2% (AS+MQ) compared with 71.1% (DHA/PQP) and 62.9% (AS+MQ) for all 
centres. The results indicated that there were more new infections at centres 21 and 22 during the 
study compared with other centres including the other three Thai centres. Although patients at centres 
Assessment Report

12, 18 and 19 were treated in Bangkok, all Thai patients were recruited from the Thai-Burmese border 
region so it is unlikely that this difference was due to geographic location. Patients at centres 21 and 
22 were only recruited to the second cohort and all were adults, so it was considered possible that 
seasonal variation in the malaria transmission rate, with a higher transmission during the second 
recruitment period, explained the lower uncorrected cure rates.  
The early, late and true treatment failure rates at Day 63 were comparable between treatments in 
each population. The rates for the pure-ITT population are shown below. 
Table 32: 
Summary of Early and Late Treatment Failure and True Treatment Failure Day 
63 (Pure-ITT Population) 
At Day 28, there was a statistically significant difference between treatments (with lower rates for 
DHA/PQP) for the sum of ETF and LTF in the m-ITT population, which reflected the difference in LTF. 
Rates of ETF+LTF were also lower in the DHA/PQP group in the PP and pure-ITT populations. True TF 
rates were also lower with DHA/PQP and statistically significantly different in the PP population (p = 
0.003). The 95% two-sided CIs for this comparison was (-3.49, -0.38%). The Day 42 findings showed 
the same pattern as at day 28. 
There was no statistically significant difference between treatment groups in the proportion of 
aparasitaemic patients up to Day 3 in either the m-ITT or PP populations. The apparent fall in the 
proportion of aparasitaemic patients on Day 3 is because patients in Laos (approximately 25% of study 
population) did not have Day 3 assessments. The median time to parasite clearance (Kaplan-Meier 
estimate) was two days for DHA/PQP and AS+MQ in all three study populations.

Table 33: 
Proportion of Aparasitaemic Patients Days 1 – 3 (m-ITT and PP Populations) 
The apparent fall in the proportion of afebrile patients on Day 3 is also due to the lack of assessments 
in Laos. The median time to fever clearance could not be calculated because of too few assessments. 
Table 34: 
Proportion of Afebrile Patients Days 0 – 3 (m-ITT and PP Populations) 
In the m-ITT population there was a statistically significant difference between treatments in fever rate 
on Day 1 (5.65% for DHA/PQP compared with 9.14% for AS+MQ; p =0.031). However, there were 
949/5039 person-fever-days in the DHA/PQP group compared with 478/2511 in the AS+MQ group.  
Gametocytes were not assessed at Day 0. At Day 28 the proportion of patients with gametocytes was 
1.24% (DHA/PQP) vs. 0% (AS+MQ) for the m-ITT and 1.05% vs. 0% (AS+MQ) for the PP population. 
Patients from centres 12, 18 and 19 did not have gametocytes assessed at Days 35, 49 and 56. 
Overall in the m-ITT population, gametocyte prevalence in the DHA/PQP group was 9.69% vs. 4.8% in 
the AS+MQ group. Person-gametocyte-weeks for the DHA/PQP group were five times that seen in the 
AS+MQ group (119/6276 person-weeks vs. 23/3052 person-weeks, which was statistically significant 
(p = 0.026). Rates in the PP population were 101/5861 person-weeks vs. 23/2884 person weeks, 
which was not a statistically significant difference (p = 0.064). These data indicated that DHA/PQP has 
a lesser gametocytocidal effect than AS+MQ.  
In the DHA/PQP group, the incidence of new infections was lower than seen in the AS+MQ group and 
the Kaplan-Meier curves showed that new infections tended to occur earlier after comparative 
treatment.

Table 35: 
New Infections at Day 63 (All Populations) 
In the m-ITT and PP populations there was no significant difference between treatments in Hb change 
from baseline to either Days 28, 63 or to the last available data (LAD) using either the actual change in 
Hb or the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method.  
In the pure-ITT population the mean Hb fell from 118.2 g/L (DHA/PQP) and 120 g/L (AS+MQ) on Day 
0 to a nadir of 107.3 g/L (DHA/PQP) 109.9 g/L (AS+MQ) on Day 7, before increasing steadily 
thereafter. A similar trend was observed for Hct. 
For the QC of PCR results the proportion of inconsistencies between the ITM laboratory and the 
independent expert (Professor G. Snounou) was 11/156 (7.1%). In addition, 35 samples were re-
analysed by the SMRU laboratory and the proportion of inconsistencies between ITM and SMRU was 
2/35 (5.7%), which was considered acceptable.  
Results of the QC of parasitaemia slides at baseline and follow-up gave an estimated type 1 
discrepancy rate (i.e. inversion of results among readers) between the site and the central laboratory 
of 12.7% (95% CI 10.7, 14.9), which was considered to be at the upper limit of acceptability. The high 
percentage of false positive results might have been due to deteriorating slide quality in the interval 
between the initial reading and the QC reading. The high percentage of false positive results in India 
might have led to an over-estimation of cure rates but the study report states that this would have 
been accounted for by the ITT analysis. 
Ancillary analyses 
After application of the WHO criteria (WHO, 2003) in order to compare the study results with the 
historical ones the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the true failure rates was less than 5% for both 
treatments. Therefore, the PCR-corrected cure rates defined by WHO (100 - true failure rate) for both 
treatments exceeded the 90% WHO threshold and the currently accepted 95% threshold on Days 63, 
28 and 42. At Day 63 the PCR-corrected cure rates were 98.17% for DHA/PQP and 96.79% for 
AS+MQ.

PCR-Corrected Cure Rates (ACPR) for Historical Comparisons (PP Population) 
Study DM040011 (Africa study) 
A phase III, randomised, non-inferiority trial to assess the efficacy and safety of  
Dihydroartemisinin + Piperaquine (DHA/PQP, Artekin™) in comparison with Artemether + 
Lumefantrine (A/L Coartem®) in children with uncomplicated P. Falciparum malaria 
Methods 
This was a multi-centre, randomised, open label, two-arm parallel group study to determine whether 
DHA/PQP was non-inferior to Coartem (artemether-lumefantrine) and to assess its safety and 
tolerability in African children with acute uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. DM 040011 was 
conducted between 16 August 2005 and 14 July 2006 at five study sites, one in each of five African 
countries 
Study Participants  
DM 040011 was to enrol subjects aged between 3 and 59 months of body weight ≥ 5 kg who had 
microscopically confirmed mono-infection with P. falciparum (parasitaemia 200 - 200,000/μL). They 
were also to have a history of fever or presence of fever (temperature ≥ 37.5°C). The general 
approach was as described for DM04010 
Treatments 
Subjects were randomised to DHA/PQP or comparator A/L (Coartem): 
Coartem was manufactured by Novartis and only tablets containing artemether 20mg and lumefantrine 
120mg were used. Dosing was as in the table followed immediately by a glass of milk.

Table 37 
The general approach to dosing was as in DM04010. 
Objectives 
The study aimed to demonstrate that the PCR-corrected cure rate of DHA/PQP was non-inferior to that 
of the comparator. This cure rate was defined as the proportion of patients with adequate clinical and 
parasitological response (ACPR) at Day 28 plus those treatment failures (TFs) identified as new P. 
falciparum (by PCR) and non-falciparum infections. 
In order to compare the study results with the historical ones, the criteria described by WHO (2003) 
were used. These failure rates computed in each treatment group were judged against the efficacy 
threshold of 90% (WHO 2006). An efficacy threshold of <90%, obtained in an analysis carried out in 
accordance with the WHO requirements, indicates that a treatment should not be considered for first-
line treatment policy. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Thick and thin Giemsa stained blood smears were obtained to verify the presence of P. falciparum and 
to calculate asexual and sexual parasite density. The used methodology is as described for study 
DM040010.   
The study aimed to demonstrate that the PCR-corrected cure rate of DHA/PQP was non-inferior to 
that of the comparator. This cure rate was defined as the proportion of patients with adequate clinical 
and parasitological response (ACPR) at Day 28 plus those treatment failures (TFs) identified as new P. 
falciparum (by PCR) and non-falciparum infections. 
ACPR was defined as absence of parasitaemia through to Day 28 irrespective of temperature and not 
meeting any of the criteria for early treatment failure (ETF) or late clinical (LCF) or parasitological 
failure (LPF). TF was defined as the sum of early and late TFs (ETF+LTF). 
ETF was defined as: 
1.  Development of danger signs or severe malaria on Days 0, 1, 2 or 3, in the presence of 
parasitaemia. 
2.  Parasite density on Day 2 > Day 0 count, irrespective of temperature. 
3.  Presence of parasitaemia on Day 3 with fever (temperature ≥37.5°C). 
4.  Parasitaemia on Day 3 ≥25 % of count on Day 0. 
Assessment Report  
EMA/739355/2011  
Page 75/129
 
 
 
 
LTF could be due to Late Clinical Failure (LCF) or Late Parasitological Failure (LPF): 
LCF was defined as: 
1.  Development of danger signs or severe malaria after Day 3 in the presence of parasitaemia. 
2.  Presence of parasitaemia and fever on any day from Day 4 to Day 28, without previously meeting 
the criteria of ETF or LCF. 
LPF was defined as reappearance of parasitaemia after initial clearance between Day 7 and Day 28 
(identified as recrudescent infection by PCR analysis) in the absence of fever (temperature <37.5°C) 
without previously meeting the criteria of ETF or LCF. 
According to the protocol, efficacy analyses were to be performed on the pure Intention-To-Treat 
(pure-ITT; all treated), modified ITT (m-ITT; pure-ITT population with the exclusion of those patients 
lost-to-follow up for unknown reasons before Day 28) and the Per Protocol (PP; pure-ITT with no major 
protocol violations) populations. The m-ITT and the PP populations were the co-primary populations 
Sample size 
For DM 040011 the simulation concluded that if the PCR-corrected cure rate at Day 28 in the ITT 
population was in the range of 91 - 93% for A/L then a sample size of 500 patients in the A/L arm and 
1000 patients in the DHA/PQP arm (1500 patients in total) was needed. A new formulation of the 
sample size requirement was part of the second protocol amendment. It was initially intended that 
each of the five sites would enrol 300 subjects to obtain the total of 1500 but this target was later 
increased to 500 for Mozambique due to under-enrolment in Kenya and Uganda in response to 
environmental conditions. 
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomised to DHA/PQP or comparator in a 2:1 ratio using sealed envelopes. 
Blinding (masking) 
An open label design was used because of the complexity of establishing a double-blind dosing 
schedule involving placebo tablets of DHA/PQP and placebo tablets of the comparator A/L. 
All decisions pertaining to the allocation of patients to various analysis populations and the assessment 
of the primary endpoint were conducted in blinded conditions and without knowledge of the PCR 
results.  The approach was as in DM04010. 
Statistical methods 
The lower limit of the one-sided 97.5% confidence interval (CI; = lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI) 
for the treatment difference in the percentage of PCR-corrected cure rates (ACPR) at Day 28 was 
computed. In order to confirm non-inferiority of DHA/PQP versus the comparator the CI lower limit was 
to be >-0.05 (i.e. within -5%) in both the m-ITT and the PP populations.  
The PCR-corrected cure rates at Day 28 were to be described by country. The Breslow-Day test (if 
each country has at least two failures for each treatment) or logistic regression (otherwise) were to be 
used to evaluate homogeneity across countries. A similar approach was taken to analysis of outcomes 
by age groups.

A range of sensitivity analyses was pre-defined. These included analyses in which: 
  All patients with missing parasitaemia were treated as failures 
  All patients with new infections as detected by PCR were excluded from the analysis (this analysis 
was added post hoc) following the suggestion of the study investigators. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Figure 15: 
Patient Disposition 
Of the 1039 patients randomised to DHA/PQP, 907 (87.3%) completed the study up to Day 28 
compared to 390/514 (75.9%) patients randomised to A/L. Similarly, in the DHA/PQP group, 767 
(73.8%) patients completed the study up to Day 42 compared to 332 (65%) in the A/L group. 
Completing the study meant that patients either reached a failure outcome or reached the last day of 
follow-up and the difference between treatments mainly reflected the failure rates 
Recruitment 
Five countries were involved in the African study, with 1 centre per country: Burkina Faso, Kenya, 
Mozambique, Uganda, and Zambia.

Conduct of the study 
Changes in the conduct of the study included two general protocol amendments but only one of these 
occurred after enrolment had started. The amended protocol 21 June 2005 was issued on 15 
November 2005 in response to the DMC who advised harmonising the statistical approaches for both 
studies in the Phase III programme. The changes were similar to those employed for study DM 040010 
in the November 2005 amendment. 
Baseline data 
The minimum age enrolled was about 6 months in accordance with the protocol with mean and median 
ages of around 2.35 years. Some children in the DHA/PQP group were clearly older than the upper age 
limit in the protocol. Baseline parasite density was similar between treatment groups in all study 
populations but varied between countries, with the highest densities occurring in Kenya and Zambia 
and the lowest densities occurring in Burkina Faso. The overall range was 10,000 – 66,000 expressed 
per µL. 
All patients had a history of fever which was of moderate severity in 81% in each treatment group. 
Fever was the only symptom that was considered severe (in 1.8% and 1% per group). Cough was the 
second most frequently reported symptom (45% per group). Mild weakness, anorexia, vomiting and flu 
symptoms were reported by >10% of patients in both treatment groups. 
Data on medications taken before recruitment are likely unreliable but show that antipyretic drugs 
were by far the most frequent previous medications and mostly paracetamol was used. Fewer than 
10% of patients had taken antimalarial drugs before recruitment. 
Numbers analysed 
The datasets analysed were as follows:

Outcomes and estimation 
For the primary endpoint in the m-ITT and PP populations the PCR-corrected cure rates gave one-sided 
97.5% CI for the difference DHA/PQP-A/L within -5%. This finding also applied in the pure-ITT 
population. For each treatment and population the uncorrected cure rates were lower than the PCR-
corrected rates. In addition, the uncorrected cure rates were notably higher in each population for 
DHA/PQP and in each case the one-sided 97.5% CI exceeded zero. 
Table 40: 
Summary of Cure Rates at Day 28 (All Populations) 
The rate of recrudescence due to withdrawal or TF before Day 14 was slightly higher in the DHA/PQP 
group in both populations. The rate of new infections was much lower in the DHA/PQP group in both 
populations.

Table 42: 
Details of the Classification of Patients by PCR-Corrected Cure Rates (ACPR) at 
Day 28 – A/L (All Populations) 
At Day 28, the proportions of true treatment failures were comparable between treatments. The sum 
of the ETFs and LTFs was lower for DHA/PQP than for A/L in all populations. This was mainly because 
of the difference in LTF rates between treatments.  
The rates of ETFs were low but were higher in the DHA/PQP group. In the pure-ITT population 9/12 
ETF patients in the DHA/PQP group and both patients in the A/L group were from Uganda and the most 
frequent reason for ETF was persistent vomiting at Day 0. Other reasons for ETF in the DHA/PQP group 
were a convulsion at Day 0, severe malaria on Day 0 requiring quinine and quinine given on Day 1 plus 
missing parasitaemia counts on Days 7 and 14.

Table 43: 
Summary of Early and Late Treatment Failure and True Treatment Failure at 
Day 28 (Pure-ITT Population) 
When stratified by age there was no difference between treatments in PCR-corrected cure rates in any 
study population but there was a statistically significant difference between treatments in uncorrected 
cure rates in the 12 - 24 and >24 month age groups in all study populations (the results for the pure-
ITT population are shown below). In both these age sub-groups the uncorrected cure rate was higher 
in the DHA/PQP group. In contrast, there was no statistically significant difference between treatments 
in the uncorrected or PCR-corrected cure rates in children aged <12 months in any study population. 
Table 44: 
Summary of Cure Rates at Day 28 by Age Classification (All Populations) 
The applicant stated that the expected rate of new infections is lower (and therefore the uncorrected 
cure rate is higher) in children aged ≤ 1 year due to some degree of shielding from mosquito bites as a 
result of close contact with the mother and maternal antibody (placental and milk-borne).

The 97.5% one-sided CI for the difference (DHA/PQP-A/L) in PCR-corrected cure rate adjusted by 
country was -4.56% in the m-ITT and -2.20% in the PP population. Cure rates were consistently lower 
for DHA/PQP versus A/L in Kenya (32). Removal of these data from the analysis did not notably affect 
the overall findings of the study.

In Kenya and in Other Countries the majority of patients were aged from 2 to ≤ 5 years and weighed 
from 7 to < 13 kg. Age and weight distributions were comparable between treatment groups within 
Kenya and within the Other Countries. However in Kenya more patients assigned to DHA/PQP were 
aged ≤ 2 years with respect to the Other Countries (47.3% vs. 40.4%) and, in parallel with the shift in 
age distribution, more fell into the weight band ≥ 7 to < 13 kg (84.7% vs. 69.6%). The same pattern 
of differences in age and weight distributions between Kenyan and other children applied in the A/L 
group.

The Cure Rates at Days 28 and 42 in Kenya and Other Countries were provided by age group and 
overall and by class of body weight and overall. The PCR-corrected cure rates at D28 and D42 among 
the Kenyan DHA/PQP patients did not show a trend to vary with age or weight. The applicant considers 
that the apparent variation in the size of the treatment differences across the classes of age and 
weight was due to fluctuation of results in the A/L group, which was considered to be random in 
nature. The same conclusion was drawn with regard to the uncorrected cure rates. Since age and 
weight did not seem to explain the lower cure rates observed with DHA/PQP in Kenya the applicant 
explored other factors (e.g. parasite density at baseline) that might contribute to the finding but was 
not able to identify any clear explanation. The applicant considers that the finding occurred by chance 
among the relatively low numbers enrolled in Kenya.  
Treating m-ITT patients with non-interpretable, missing or not done PCRs as either failures, successes 
or excluding them had no statistically significant effect on the PCR-corrected cure rates and the 97.5% 
one-sided CI was within 5% in all instances. However, all three approaches gave a highly statistically 
significant effect on the uncorrected cure rate that reflected the data from Burkina Faso and Zambia 
where the greatest difference between treatments in uncorrected cure rates was observed. 
The results of the pre-planned input strategies for patients who were lost-to-follow-up and for patients 
without a valid PCR result (pure-ITT population) gave PCR-corrected cure rates that ranged from 90.94 
- 93.43% for the DHA/PQP group and 91.27 - 94.90% for the A/L group. For all strategies, the 97.5% 
one-sided CI was within -5%. When all patients with missing parasitaemia data were classified as 
failures the 97.5% one-sided CI remained within -5%. Excluding patients with new P. falciparum 
infection detected by PCR or new non-falciparum infection had minimal effects on the PCR-corrected 
cure rates and the 97.5% one-sided CI remained within -5% in all populations.  
At Day 14 in both the m-ITT and the PP populations the lower limits of the two-sided 95% CI for PCR-
corrected cure rates were within -5%. There were no statistically significant differences in uncorrected 
cure rates between treatments and these resembled their corresponding PCR-corrected rates. At Day 
42 the PCR-corrected cure rates in the m-ITT and PP populations were slightly higher in the A/L group. 
The lower limits of the two-sided 95% CIs were within -5% in the pure-ITT and the PP populations but 
the limit was -6.55 in the m-ITT population. However, the treatment differences in uncorrected cure 
rates were significant in all study populations in favour of the DHA/PQP group. 
In the m-ITT population the rates of recrudescent infection at Day 42 were generally comparable 
between treatments.  The statistically significant difference (p < 0.001) in uncorrected cure rates 
(ACPR) between treatments reflected the lower rates of new P. falciparum or non-falciparum infections 
by Day 42 for DHA/PQP compared to A/L with rates of 11.9% vs. 21.1% in the m-ITT population and 
12.4% vs. 22.1% in the PP population. 
By Day 42, the sum of ETFs and LTFs for DHA/PQP was lower than for A/L at 19.8% vs. 27.8% (p < 
0.001) in the m-ITT population and 18.7% vs. 26.4% (p < 0.001) in the PP population. This was due 
to fewer LTFs (LCF and LPF) in the DHA/PQP group. The late treatment failure rates were 18.6% vs. 
27.4% (p < 0.001) in the m-ITT and 18.6% vs. 26.4% (p < 0.001) in the PP population for respective 
treatments. The true treatment failure rates were 6.3% vs. 4% in the m-ITT and 5.6% vs. 3.7% in the 
PP population.

In each of the m-ITT and PP populations higher proportions of patients in the DHA/PQP group were 
aparasitaemic on Day 1 (24 h after starting treatment). The median time to parasite clearance 
(Kaplan-Meier estimate) was two days for both treatments in all three study populations. 
Table 48: 
Proportion of Aparasitaemic Patients Days 0 – 3 (m-ITT and PP Populations) 
Slightly higher proportions in the DHA/PQP group were afebrile at Day 1. Three measurements over a 
48 h period were too few to allow calculation of the median time to fever clearance.

Table 49: 
Proportion of Afebrile Patients Days 0 – 3 (m-ITT and PP Populations) 
While comparable proportions (11-13%) in the treatment groups and populations had gametocytes at 
enrolment a higher proportion in the DHA/PQP group still had gametocytes at Day 2 (16.7% vs. 9.3% 
in the m-ITT population). This difference persisted and was statistically significant until Day 21 in both 
study populations indicating that DHA/PQP had a lesser gametocytocidal effect than A/L. 
There was no significant differences between treatments in Hb change from baseline to either Day 28 
or Day 42 but changes to last available data (LAD) were statistically significantly different between 
treatments (17.3 g/L DHA/PQP vs. 14.8 g/L A/L, ANOVA, p = 0.016 m-ITT and similar results for the 
PP population), which may reflect the higher number of new P. falciparum infections by PCR and new 
non-falciparum infections and thus associated anaemia occurring in the A/L-treated patients.  
Quality control of PCR analyses showed that the proportion of inconsistencies between the ITM 
laboratory and the independent expert (Professor G. Snounou) was 37/317 (11.7%). The rate of 
inconsistencies between the ITM and the SMRU laboratories was 2/58 (3.4%), which was considered 
acceptable. The level of agreement between the independent observers was adequate. 
Quality control of parasitaemia slides at baseline and follow-up gave an estimated percentage of type I 
discrepancies (i.e. inversion of results among readers) between the site and the central laboratory 
readings of 7.6% (95% CI 5.9, 9.8), which was similar to that reported in the literature. Kenya did not 
participate in this exercise. 
Ancillary analyses 
After applying the WHO criteria (WHO, 2003) the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the true failure rates at Day 
28 was 2.77 for both treatments. Therefore, the PCR-corrected cure rates defined by WHO (100- true 
failure rate) of both treatments were equal to 97.23% and exceeded both the 90% WHO threshold and 
95% threshold for new treatments. The study report states that the performance of A/L in the present 
study was consistent with that expected from the literature. For example, true failure rates in the PP 
populations at day 28 of 1.9%, 3.2 % and 2.7% were reported in different studies. Higher rates were 
reported in two publications: (7.0%; von Seidlein L et al 1997 and 8.9%; Kamya MR et al 2007) but 
both of these studies were conducted in areas and seasons with a particularly high transmission rate.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The applicant has not integrated or compared the efficacy data between the two Phase III studies due 
to the many differences in population and the potential effects of geographical region and parasites on 
the outcomes. This omission is considered to be appropriate. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
Not applicable 
Supportive studies 
The two phase I/II studies were single centre, single arm studies and were aimed at investigating the 
PK profile of DHA/PQP and were definitively underpowered to draw any conclusion on cure rates. 
Therefore, the analyses of all efficacy endpoints were carried out only at a descriptive level.  Efficacy 
was not the primary objective of these studies, but was examined as secondary objective. 
A total of 32 patients were recruited into the African study (DM 04008) and 25 patients were recruited 
in the Asian study (DM 04009).  In general, the medical history for the patients in both Phase I/II 
studies is consistent with acute malaria. 
The same three day, weight-based dose regimen and timing of the dose was used in the Phase I/II 
studies as for the Phase III studies.  The dosing regimen in the African Phase I/II study provided for a 
potential dose of between 1.6-3.6 mg/kg/day DHA and 12.8-29.1 mg/kg/day PQP.  In the Asian Phase 
I/II study, the regimen provided for a potential daily dose of 1.6-3.6 mg/kg/day DHA and 12.8-29.1 
mg/kg/day PQP. 
All secondary endpoints recorded in Phase III studies (with the exception of gametocytes) were 
recorded also in the Phase I/II studies. 
Results 
 
In the African study there was one ETF. The number of LTF was equal to three at Day 28, 14 at 
Day 42 and 25 at Day 90. 
 
 
 
There was no ETF and only one LTF (at Day 56) in the Asian study. 
The true treatment failures as defined by WHO were not estimated in the Phase I/II studies. 
In the Asian study, all patients were clear of parasitaemia by Day 7, while in the African study all 
patients were clear of parasitaemia by Day 2. 
 
In the Asian study, all the patients were afebrile by Day 2, while in the African study all the 
patients were afebrile by Day 1.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The clinical development programme included two well conducted Phase III clinical trials. These were 
designed to reflect the differences in baseline immunity and transmission risks for malaria in the 
differing endemic regions.  Thus, studies were considered separately due to the many differences in 
populations and the potential effects of geographical region and parasites on the outcomes. Both trials 
had an acceptable open label design.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Both trials met the primary endpoint demonstrating non-inferiority of DHA/PQP to the appropriate 
comparator for treatment of patients with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria.   The true treatment 
failure rates in the two pivotal studies were 1.8% and 2.8% for studies DM 040010 and DM 040011 
respectively.  These are well within the current standard of 5% set by the WHO. Eurartesim was non-
inferior to comparators regarding the rates of recrudescence and new infection.  Indeed, for both trials, 
Eurartesim was statistically and clinically superior to the comparator combinations for uncorrected cure 
rate and the rate of new infections at all time points starting from Day 28. Data indicated however that 
for both studies, DHA/PQP has a lesser gametocytocidal effect than comparator.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Eurartesim has been shown to be non-inferior to established standard-of-care comparator drugs in 
each of two large, well-designed pivotal studies performed in two different malaria-endemic regions.  
For both studies, the results have been shown to be robust based on several sensitivity analyses.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Due to major differences between the studies, safety data have been addressed separately by study 
under each sub-headings below. With very small numbers in the two preliminary studies in adults and 
children, most attention was given to the data from the Phase III studies DM 040010 and DM 040011 
Patient exposure 
The safety database for exposure to DHA/PQP consists primarily of data from the five clinical studies 
sponsored by Sigma-tau. The total database includes 1862 adult and paediatric patients with malaria.  
The two pivotal Phase III clinical trials were designed to reflect the differences in baseline immunity 
and transmission risks for malaria in the differing endemic regions. For these studies, the three study 
populations investigated were: the pure-Intention to Treat (ITT), the modified ITT (m-ITT) and the per 
protocol (PP) population. The ITT population was the same population as the safety population, which 
was defined as all randomised patients who received at least one dose of the study treatment. This 
definition was also used in the Phase I/II and in the healthy volunteer study.

The demographic and baseline characteristics of the populations in Phase III trials are displayed in the 
following table: 
Table 53: 
Overall Demographic and Baseline Characteristics – Phase III Studies (Safety 
Population) 
  DM 040010: In the m-ITT population the proportions vomiting within 30 min of dosing were 1.1% 
for both treatments but the proportion of patients vomiting 30-60 min after dosing was higher in 
the DHA/PQP group (1.5% vs. 0.3%). Vomiting was reported as a presenting complaint in 28% in 
each treatment group so may have partly reflected acute malaria. Vomiting was reported as a 
treatment emerging adverse event (TEAE) at any time during the study in 2.5% DHA/PQP and 
6.3% AS+MQ patients groups while persistent vomiting leading to withdrawal before Day 63 
occurred in four DHA/PQP patients.  
  DM 040011: The highest incidence of vomiting occurred within 30 min of taking the first dose on 
Day 0 (10.6% and 9.6% per group). Over the three dosing days, 17.3% and 14.1% in respective 
treatment groups vomited at least once. Vomiting was reported as a presenting complaint in 
13.9% and 12.2% and was reported as a TEAE at any time during the study in 6.8% in each 
group. Persistent vomiting led to study withdrawal before Day 28 in 22 children in the DHA/PQP 
group and 4 in the A/L group.

Adverse events  
DM 040010: The proportions experiencing at least one TEAE were comparable between treatments 
(69% DHA/PQP and 72% AS+MQ). The greater number of malaria AEs in the AS+MQ group was 
consistent with more new P. falciparum and non-falciparum infections in this group.  
The table shows some AEs for which differences in rates between treatment groups were ≥ 2%. 
Table 54: 
TEAEs with Differences (>±2%) Between Treatment Groups (Safety 
Population) 
The table below shows some of the differences between treatments for certain types of drug-related 
AEs. The rates of cardiac AEs considered related were 3.5% for DHA/PQP and 2.1% for AS+MQ.

The higher rate of cardiac AEs (all and related) in the DHA/PQP group was explored further. The 
individual preferred terms (PTs) are shown below by relationship and severity. 
Table 56: 
TEAEs Summarised by Maximum Severity and Relationship to Study Treatment 
Only Cardiac AEs Safety Population 
The applicant stated that most cases of sinus bradycardia or tachycardia consisted of heart rates that 
were borderline when measured by the core ECG laboratory and were deemed to be of minor clinical 
significance. Also, some reports did not correspond to the heart rate measured by the physician during 
the visit or that measured by the ECG core laboratory. In the DHA/PQP group there was a slightly 
greater frequency of bradycardia, sinus tachycardia and arrhythmias as compared to the AS+MQ 
group. 
Sinus bradycardia, sinus tachycardia and sinus arrhythmia accounted for most of the overall difference 
in “cardiac TEAEs” between the DHA/PQP and AS+MQ groups. All these TEAEs were considered by the 
investigators to be of mild intensity but the basis for the investigators’ grading of these events is not 
clear. In addition, rates for bradycardia and tachycardia were clearly higher in the DHA/PQP group. 
Review of cases of sinus bradycardia and tachycardia showed that most were present on ECG but were 
not identified by the physician at the corresponding study visit. In many cases the rates were just 
outside of the normal limits and the subjects were asymptomatic. However, heart rates > 120 bpm 
seem to have occurred in 35 subjects and rates > 130 bpm in 7 subjects. 
The overall proportions with mild, moderate and severe TEAEs were comparable between treatment 
groups (55.2%, 12.4% and 1.8% for DHA/PQP and 57.7%, 12.6% and 2.1% for AS+MQ). The most 
frequently reported AEs (related and unrelated) in the DHA/PQP and AS+MQ groups were headache 
(18% vs. 20%), malaria (14.5% vs. 22.6%), P. falciparum malaria (13.4% vs. 15.2%) and pyrexia 
(10.6% vs. 11.3%).  
Subjective fever was reported by 58.3% (mild), 18.4% (moderate) and 0.3% (severe) in the DHA/PQP 
group and by 56.7% (mild), 20% (moderate) and 0.8% (severe) in the AS+MQ group. Headache was 
reported by 41% (mild) and 18% (moderate) in the DHA/PQP group and by 37.8% (mild), 21% 
(moderate) and 0.3% (severe) in the AS+MQ group. Nausea was reported less often in the DHA/PQP 
group with rates of 11.3% mild and 0.4% moderate vs. 17.3% mild and 1.3% moderate. Similarly, 
vomiting was reported with rates of 6.1% mild and 0.4% moderate (DHA/PQP) vs. 9.7% mild and 
0.8% moderate (AS+MQ).

Adverse event of special interest 
In this study baseline and pre-dose Day 2 12-lead ECGs were obtained. These were viewed during 
recording and transmitted directly to MDS Central Telemedicine Department in France for 
interpretation and reporting except for ECGs from centre 19 (Thailand) where paper ECGs were printed 
and then sent to MDS Pharma. The ECGs were measured semi-automatically on a superimposed 
representative complex. 
The descriptive analysis of mean values showed a highly statistically significant difference between 
treatments in the change in QTcB and QTcF intervals from baseline to Day 2 (ANOVA, p <0.001) with 
longer intervals in the DHA/PQP group. The Day 2 change in QTc from baseline was statistically 
significantly different between treatments by both Bazett’s and Fridericia’s methods. At Day 7 the 
difference in QTcF was significant but slightly fewer patients in the DHA/PQP group (1.8%) showed an 
increase in QTc > 60 ms compared with the AS+MQ group (2.9%).

There was no statistically significant difference between treatments in the proportion of patients with 
QTc >500 ms by either method at any time during the study. Three patients experienced prolonged 
(i.e. >500 ms) QTcF intervals and four patients experienced prolonged QTcB intervals. These patients 
(five in total) were all recruited to the DHA/PQP group.

Table 59: 
QTc  (QTcB  &  QTcF)  Values  Classified  as  >500  msec  or  ≤500  msec.  (Safety 
Population) 
The comparison of QTcB means on D0 and D2 shows that in both treatment groups the values were 
greater for female subjects but the mean change from baseline in the DHA/PQP group was smaller for 
female subjects (3.14 ms vs. 5.80 ms in male subjects) while corresponding values by gender in the 
AS+MQ group were 4.73 ms and -2.44 ms. The overall comparison between treatments for changes 
from baseline and the comparison for male subjects only were statistically significant (p < 0.001) with 
larger changes in the DHA/PQP group. In contrast the comparison for female subjects only did not 
reach significance (p = 0.610). The actual changes in QTcF values were greater than those observed 
when using the QTcB data. Actual mean values on D0 and D2 were not consistently or notably greater 
in female vs. male subjects. However, the same pattern of findings as for QTcB applied to the analysis 
of changes from baseline overall and by gender.

Subjects aged < 16 years in both treatment groups showed greater mean QTcB values vs. older 
subjects on D0 and D2 and greater changes from baseline. The comparison between treatments for 
changes from baseline was statistically significant (p < 0.001) overall and for those aged ≥ 16 years 
with greater changes in the DHA/PQP group but there was only a numerical difference for the younger 
subjects. In contrast, the QTcF data on D0 and D2 showed that actual values were smaller in those 
aged < 16 years. Nevertheless, as for QTcB, the comparison between treatments for changes from 
baseline was significant (p < 0.001) overall and for those aged ≥ 16 years with greater changes in the 
DHA/PQP group but there was only a numerical difference for the younger subjects. The magnitude of 
the difference in change between treatment groups was 4.76 ms for those aged < 16 years and 9.25 
ms for the older age group. 
The applicant observes that there was no gender imbalance for total TEAEs in the two SOCs. In the 
DHA/PQP group subjects aged < 16 years had a higher rate of cardio-vascular TEAEs (21.4% vs. 
11.8%), which reflects the rates of sinus tachycardia (6.9% vs. 2.4%) and QTc prolongation (12.7% 
vs. 5.7%). 
DM 040011 
The proportion of patients experiencing at least one TEAE was similar between treatment groups 
(79.3% DHA/PQP and 80.6% A/L). The table shows some AEs for which differences in rates between 
treatment groups were ≥ 2%.

The proportions of patients with mild, moderate and severe TEAEs were comparable between 
treatment groups at 50.3%, 25.6% and 3.4% respectively for DHA/PQP compared with 49.2%, 28.4% 
and 2.9% respectively for A/L. The overall proportions of patients with treatment-related TEAEs were 
also comparable between treatments (71% DHA/PQP and 72% A/L). The table shows some differences 
for drug-related AEs that occurred at rates ≥ 2%.

In both treatment groups cough was the most frequently reported AE with rates of 39.8% and 32% 
related for DHA/PQP compared to 38% and 31% related for A/L. However, it is not understood why 
cough might have been considered drug-related by investigators. Cough was considered most often 
associated with influenza, pneumonia and P. falciparum infection. Pyrexia was reported with rates of 
29.1% and 22.4% related in the DHA/PQP group compared to 32% and 24.3% related in the A/L 
group. Pyrexia was often temporally associated with cough, influenza, P. falciparum infection, 
diarrhoea and vomiting. There were no arrhythmias reported during the study.  
Using Bazett’s method the proportions of patients with normal, borderline or prolonged QTc intervals at 
baseline were 80.4%, 14.6% and 3.7% for DHA/PQP compared to 79.8%, 13.9% and 5.5% for A/L.

However, on Day 2 the pre-dose ECGs showed that a statistically significantly higher proportion of 
patients in the DHA/PQP group (60.3%, 29.1% and 9.1% with normal, borderline and prolonged QTc 
intervals) had borderline QTc intervals compared to the A/L group (72.2%, 19.8% and 6.9% 
respectively) and the proportion with prolonged QTc was numerically higher.   
There was no significant difference between treatment groups in the proportion of patients with QTc 
intervals >500 ms (e.g. two per group on Day 2). Change in QTc interval from baseline to Day 2 
showed less QTc shortening and more prolongation in the DHA/PQP group compared with A/L (Mantel-
Haenszel Chi-square test, p < 0.001). In the DHA/PQP group, 46.7% had an increase <30 ms, 19.6% 
had a prolongation 30 - 60 ms and 2.7% had a prolongation >60 ms. These rates compare with 
46.1%, 13.5% and 2%, respectively, in the A/L group.  
Using Fridericia’s method the proportions of patients with normal, borderline and prolonged QTc 
intervals were not significantly different between treatments at any visit and the only QTc value >500 
ms occurred in one patient on Day 2 in the A/L group. However, as for QTcB, the increase in QTc 
intervals from baseline was statistically significantly greater for DHA/PQP on Day 2. 
Descriptive analyses showed a highly statistically significant difference between treatments in the 
change in QT, QTc Bazett and QTc Fridericia values from baseline to Day 2. 
Table 63: 
Descriptive ECG Analyses (Means) During the Study (Safety Population) 
The study report states that the lengthening of QT from baseline to Day 2 was probably due to the fall 
in HR. Patients were tachycardic throughout the study but particularly so at baseline.  
The change in QTcB from baseline to Day 2 is said to be inconclusive and may have been over-
corrected whereas the change in QTcF may be clinically significant (i.e. associated with increased risk 
of arrhythmia) particularly for DHA/PQP.  
The QTcB data showed a trend for smaller mean changes from baseline as weight increased in the A/L 
group. The treatment comparison for changes from baseline was statistically significant (p < 0.001) for 
the weight class from 13 to < 18 kg and overall but not for other classes. The QTcF data did not show 
a specific trend in either treatment group but the treatment comparison for change from baseline was 
statistically significant (p < 0.001) overall and in the weight classes from 13 to < 18 kg and from 7 to

for the other weight classes showed numerically greater changes in the DHA/PQP group.

The actual differences between treatments for the changes in QTcF from baseline were 7.54 ms, 3.82 
ms, 12.74 ms and 5.29 ms for ascending weight classes. The applicant points out that only the two 
middle weight classes included a reasonable sample size and considered the differences to be of a 
random nature.

Cardiac SOC TEAEs and those coded as ECG abnormalities by weight classes up to 18 kg (there were 
no such AEs reported in the small numbers with weight > 18 kg) did not suggest any consistent excess 
of TEAEs in the DHA/PQP group. 
Overall view of ECGs 
In the applicant’s summary and based on patient data (i.e. without taking into account the data from 
DM09-006) it was concluded that Eurartesim does have a greater potential for QTc prolongation than 
the comparator drugs against which it was tested but it is stated that the effect is short-lived since it is 
not apparent at Day 7. It was stated that the cause is uncertain but the regression analysis performed 
in the patients of the Asian Phase I/II study suggested that QTc prolongation does not correlate with 
peak plasma concentrations of DHA but with those of PQP. This was later corroborated by the data 
from DM09-006. 
Nevertheless, the D0 and D2 ECGs in subjects with acute malaria were all obtained pre-dose. The 
studies did not capture ECGs around Cmax of either active and therefore the changes from baseline 
observed in each treatment group are very unlikely to be the maximal changes to be expected during 
each dose interval.   
The QTcF values showed a comparable treatment difference among subjects who were re-dosed due to 
vomiting in the African study as in all other subjects. Among re-dosed patients there were no 
statistically significant differences in QTcB values detected for changes from Baseline to Day 2 and Day 
7. The QTcF values from Baseline to D2 (but not to D7) showed a statistically significant difference 
(p=0.02) favouring A/L. No subject re-dosed with DHA/PQP had a QTcB or QTcF value over 500 ms on 
D0, D2 or D7. The maximum change in QTcF was 102 ms on D2 and 78 ms on D7 but the actual 
maximum QTcF observed was 436 ms on D2 and 430 ms on D7.  
The summary also stated that there was no evidence of a corresponding increased risk of AEs 
associated with QT prolongation. However, the actual numbers are shown below and, while small, 
there are some imbalances.

Table 65: 
Incidence of QT-associated TEAEs in Pivotal Studies (Safety Population) 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
DM 040010 
There were no deaths in this study. There were more patients with SAEs in the DHA/PQP group (1.6%) 
compared with the AS+MQ group (0.8%) but the proportions with SAEs considered drug-related were 
comparable at 0.8%. In the DHA/PQP group there were twelve SAEs in twelve patients of which six 
were considered to be related to DHA/PQP (three ‘unlikely’ and three ‘possible’). In the AS+MQ group 
there were three SAEs in three patients, with relatedness described as one ‘unlikely’, one ‘possible’ and 
one ‘probable’. 
The six SAEs categorised as related to DHA/PQP included two cases of worsening anaemia considered 
unlikely to be related, a viral infection requiring hospitalisation on day 51 thought unlikely to be 
related, a case of Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) diagnosed on Day 2 (which the investigator considered 
possibly related to DHA/PQP even though this is a congenital cardiac conduction anomaly), a grand mal 
convulsion three hours after the first dose in a 38 year-old male considered possibly related to

DHA/PQP and a case of mild encephalitis on Day 45, which resulted in a left sided hemiplegia thought 
to be possibly related. 
DM 040011 
The overall mortality rate was 0.13% (2/1548) with one death in each treatment group. The death in 
the DHA/PQP group occurred in a 3 year-old whose condition deteriorated suddenly on Day 2. The 
investigator thought that death was unlikely to be related to DHA/PQP and might have been caused by 
hypoglycaemia secondary to severe malaria (but there is no glucose result available), hepatitis or 
septicaemia. The Day 2 ECG was reported as abnormal and heart rate was 163 bpm. A post-mortem 
examination was not performed. 
In the DHA/PQP group 19 SAEs occurred in 18 patients (1.73%) of which 16 were considered related 
to DHA/PQP but 14 were graded “unlikely”. In the A/L group there were five SAEs (1%) of which four 
were deemed related to study treatment.  
The study report states that the overall difference between treatments in SAE rates was mainly due to 
the higher incidence of infections seen in the DHA/PQP group (n = 13, comprising P. falciparum 
malaria n = 4, pyrexia n = 3, pneumonia = 3, severe malaria n = 1, bronchiolitis n = 1 and 
gastroenteritis = 1) compared to none in the A/L group. 
In the DHA/PQP group two cases of hepatitis were considered possibly and probably related to 
DHA/PQP: 
  One patient aged 2 years developed moderate hepatitis on Day 3 (ALT 236 u/L, mild jaundice 
(Days 6 - 21) and mild hepatomegaly (Days 7 - 14). On Day 7 hepatitis A serology was positive 
and hepatitis B and C serology were negative. The hepatitis resolved without intervention by Day 
28 and the investigator thought the hepatitis was probably related to DHA/PQP. 
 
The other patient was aged 4 years and developed severe hepatitis on Day 38. ALT rose from 52 
iu/L to 1300.45 iu/L and bilirubin rose from 0.12 mg/dL to 8.08 mg/dL on Days 28 and 42, 
respectively. Hepatitis B serology was negative and hepatitis A and C serology was not performed. 
The hepatitis resolved without intervention by Day 59 and the investigator thought this was 
possibly related to DHA/PQP. 
Laboratory findings 
DM 040010 
Patients were mildly thrombocytopenic at recruitment. Hb, Hct and platelet counts improved and 
eosinophilia rates increased during the course of the study. All haematological changes were consistent 
with recovery from malaria and during the course of the study the proportion of patients in both 
treatment groups with Hct, Hb and platelet counts within the normal range increased.  
At enrolment total and direct bilirubin were raised due to haemolysis associated with acute malaria. At 
the end of the study all biochemical variables were within normal ranges and fewer than 3% of 
patients showed signs of haemolysis, possibly associated with new infections. 
Assessment Report  
EMA/739355/2011  
Page 116/129
 
 
 
DM 040011 
There were overall improvements in anaemia during the study. Non-clinically significant eosinophilia 
developed in 3.5% per group and shifts in eosinophil counts of approximately 17% (DHA/PQP) and 
14% (A/L) from low non-clinically significant to normal were seen. 
ALT, total bilirubin and creatinine were measured at all centres. AST, GGT, alkaline phosphatase, direct 
bilirubin, total protein, urea nitrogen, glucose and albumin were measured only in Burkina Faso, Kenya 
and Zambia. Direct bilirubin was raised at baseline (in 4.7% and 5.1% per group) but within normal 
limits by Day 42 and was probably due to haemolysis associated with malaria. The proportions with 
raised bilirubin fell to 2.3% in both groups by the end of the study 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
DM 040010 
Paracetamol was taken by 66% and 68% of patients in the two groups. One quarter of all patients was 
taking vitamin B-complex, one third received dextrose and sodium chloride and about one quarter 
received a glucose injection. 
DM 040011 
Paracetamol was taken by 83% and 82% per group. Over half of all patients took an antibacterial 
agent during the trial with amoxicillin prescribed most often (44% and 46%). Ferrous sulfate was 
prescribed for anaemia associated with malaria in 15% per group. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
DM 040010 
Four patients in the DHA/PQP group and one in the AS+MQ group stopped treatment prematurely due 
to AEs.  All AEs resolved completely. The table does not show all discontinuations from study

DM 040011 
Five patients in Kenya in the DHA/PQP group stopped treatment prematurely due to AEs. None of these 
AEs was serious and all resolved completely. One patient took Malarone for P. falciparum malaria on 
Days 2-4 and Claritin for the skin reaction and pruritus on Days 2-6. Another took Malarone for P. 
falciparum malaria on Days 2-4, paracetamol on Days 1-3 and Piriton for the skin reaction on Days 2-5 
and one other took Piriton for allergic dermatitis on Days 2- 6. There was no history of chloroquine use 
by these three patients. There were no early discontinuations in the A/L group at any centre.

Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data with Eurartesim are available.  However, a short summary of the 
postmarketing experience from similar combination drugs Artekin and DuoCotexim was provided.   
Meta-analysis on safety of PQP 
A meta-analysis on safety of PQP derived from published literature, compared the number of deaths 
which occurred in 55 clinical trials in patients treated with PQP alone or in combination with any other 
compound(s). In total 19,446 patients treated with DHA/PQP were considered (9,015 in controlled 
studies and 561 in uncontrolled studies for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria, 192 in PK studies 
and 9,678 in IPT studies). The results demonstrate no excess of risk of dying in the DHA/PQP group as 
compared with all other considered treatment groups.  However, due to several deficiencies, this meta-
analysis cannot rule out the possibility of differences between the different antimalarials.  
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
The safety database for Eurartesim consists of exposure to subjects enrolled in clinical studies 
sponsored by the applicant and included 1862 adult and paediatric patients with malaria.  Most data 
are derived from the pivotal trials DM 040010 and DM 040011. Overall, Eurartesim treatment was well 
tolerated in the studied patient populations.  As an important TEAE, QTc prolongation was identified.  
The QTc prolongation was asymptomatic in all cases and was not associated with more clinically 
significant abnormalities. The applicant provided a meta-analysis of safety of piperaquine derived from 
Assessment Report  
EMA/739355/2011  
Page 118/129
 
 
 
 
 
published papers that did not suggest an excess risk of death for Eurartesim vs. other antimalarial 
agents.  However, this meta-analysis cannot rule out the possibility of an excess risk.  
In the Asian study, analysis of rates of all cardiac AEs and drug-related cardiac AEs in the DHA/PQP 
group of arrhythmic nature (sinus bradycardia, sinus tachycardia and sinus arrhythmia) showed that 
these were more frequent in the DHA/PQP group than AS+MQ group. However, all drug-related events 
of arrhythmic nature were considered mild, not serious and occurred without concomitant 
cardiovascular events. 
The limitations of the safety database were influenced by eligibility criteria used in pivotal trials  
The trials did not include elderly patients, pregnant or lactating women and patients with moderate or 
severe liver or moderate to severe renal diseases. 
The follow up of patients in the Phase III studies was too short to allow detection of long-term adverse 
reactions. 
Additional expert consultations 
During the MA application, an Ad-Hoc Expert Committee was convened to discuss cardiac safety 
aspects of Eurartesim.  The questions posed to experts were as follows: 
 
The possible risk of cardiac arrhythmia secondary to QTc prolongation even when Eurartesim is 
administered in the fasting state 
 
 
The possible effect of administration in the fasting state on efficacy 
In light of their findings on these issues, the advisory group is requested to comment on the 
possible role of Eurartesim in the management of acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria in the 
EU 
Overall, the experts advised that the significant QTc prolongation observed with Eurartesim 
administration poses a problem and unpredictable risk for a small proportion of people. However, they 
were reassured by the data when Eurartesim was administered in the fasting state and by the clinical 
data that are available so far.   
The data on efficacy whilst fasting were reassuring and permit recommendation for administration of 
Eurartesim between meals. 
Overall, Eurartesim would increase the available therapeutic armamentarium. It provides an additional 
choice in treating uncomplicated falciparum malaria.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
In clinical trials, Eurartesim was generally safe and well tolerated.  
Treatment emergent QTc prolongation was asymptomatic in all cases. The magnitude of QTc 
prolongation is reduced if dosing occurs between meals. The potential concern that the QTc 
prolongation might lead to serious cardiac arrhythmias is addressed appropriately in the approved 
RMP. 
Limitations of the safety database include missing information on categories of patients belonging to 
the target population. This shortcoming is reflected in the Product Information as stated in sections 4.3 
or 4.4 of the SmPC and in the RMP. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety: 
Assessment Report

To further substantiate the cardiac safety of Eurartesim use in patients with signs and symptoms of 
uncomplicated malaria, including the effect of Eurartesim administration on QTc intervals, the MAH 
shall provide the results of an epidemiological study addressing this issue, according to a CHMP agreed 
protocol.

The SPC was amended to reflect the new 
findings from the food interaction studies: 
Eurartesim should only be taken with 
water and without food. Each dose should 
be taken no less than 3 hours after the 
last food intake. No food should be taken 
within 3 hours after each dose. 
Additional risk minimization activities:

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Eurartesim meets the WHO recommendations for ACT since it comprises an artemisinin with a longer-
acting partner drug.  The two Phase 3 studies have demonstrated acceptable clinical efficacy of 
Eurartesim for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in endemic areas. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The possibility that dosing apart from food as recommended in the SmPC could have a negative impact 
on efficacy cannot be wholly dismissed. There is no appreciable effect of food on DHA absorption, 
which affects the early parasiticidal activity, but dosing Eurartesim with food greatly enhances 
piperaquine plasma levels. In this regard, the timing of the three daily doses in relation to food intake 
could not be discerned with confidence from the data collected during the Phase 3 clinical studies. 
While it is likely that the first doses were often taken on an empty stomach due to acute illness, the 
actual dosing conditions probably changed as clinical recovery ensued so that the second and third 
doses were more likely to have been taken with or close to a meal.   
It is not possible to be sure that the efficacy observed in subjects resident in endemic areas would 
necessarily apply to returning EU travellers. EU travellers will comprise a mixture of ethnicities and a 
proportion of EU residents who spent much of their early life in endemic areas may still have some 
residual immunity to malaria but the majority will not. Plasma exposure to DHA and to PQP was at 
least numerically higher in healthy Asians vs. Caucasian subjects and was higher for DHA in female vs. 
male subjects on dosing after a light meal. However, the plasma levels of DHA are clearly very 
different between subjects with acute malaria and healthy subjects, which makes it difficult to draw 
any conclusions from these observations.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
With the exception of effects on QTc intervals, the types and rates of unfavourable effects documented 
in the clinical studies were comparable between Eurartesim and the other ACTs that were evaluated.  
Assessment Report  
EMA/739355/2011  
Page 125/129
 
 
 
 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The current safety database is not sufficiently large to determine whether the QTc effect of Eurartesim 
will translate into arrhythmias and, if so, how frequently these may occur. However, the non-clinical 
data suggest that, despite the effect on QTc, the torsadogenic potential of Eurartesim may be low and 
there are currently no clinical data (from sponsored or published studies) that indicate a signal for 
clinically significant treatment-associated arrhythmias.  
Benefit-risk balance 
On current evidence, the risk-benefit balance of Eurartesim in treatment of uncomplicated falciparum 
malaria could be deemed favourable. This position takes into account the risk for cardiac side effects 
resulting from the pronounced Eurartesim-induced QTc-interval prolongation as demonstrated in the 
thorough QTc-study as well as in the pivotal clinical studies.  It is considered that these safety 
concerns be sufficiently covered by the precautionary measures stated in the product literature. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Malaria is a global problem with the greatest burden of disease and mortality occurring in tropical 
countries.  Malaria is particularly dangerous in children under 5 years of age, pregnant women and 
previously unexposed visitors to endemic areas.  P. falciparum is the most prevalent, treatment 
resistant form of malaria and is responsible for the severe and most deadly forms of the disease in 
children and adults. 
A substantial number of EU residents are at risk of contracting malaria during leisure or business travel 
and migration. Eurartesim is an artemisinin-containing combination (ACT) that is recommended by the 
2010 WHO guidelines for the treatment of malaria and is currently expected to be active against P. 
falciparum worldwide.  In the two Phase 3 studies conducted in Asia (including areas with multiple 
drug-resistant falciparum strains) and in Africa, Eurartesim showed comparable efficacy to other ACT 
regimens in residents of endemic areas.  However, based on pharmacokinetic data and plasma levels it 
cannot be ruled out that efficacy might not be quite as good as observed in the Phase 3 studies in 
subjects with no prior exposure to malaria and when Eurartesim is dosed apart from food.  
The sponsored clinical studies indicated that, with the exception of the degree of effect on the QTc 
interval, the safety profile of Eurartesim was comparable to that of other ACTs. The non-clinical data 
and the available clinical data do not suggest that the effect on QTc is associated with serious cardiac 
arrhythmias, including torsades de pointes, but this possibility cannot be dismissed. Hence the SmPC 
and RMP take into consideration this possibility. In particular, the SmPC includes contraindications, 
warnings and precautions that are intended to minimise any risk for serious cardiac arrhythmias to 
occur. 
Likewise as for other infective diseases, it is vital for the physician to have multiple treatment options.  
As such, Eurartesim might offer a useful alternative to current lead treatments available in Europe.    
Overall, Eurartesim provides a Europe-wide alternative in the armamentarium of uncomplicated P. 
falciparum malaria treatment. The identified safety concerns are addressed in the Risk Management 
Plan (RMP) and Annex II.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by majority 
decision that the risk-benefit balance of Eurartesim in the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium 
falciparum malaria in adults, children and infants 6 months and over and weighing 5 kg or more is 
favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the 
following conditions:

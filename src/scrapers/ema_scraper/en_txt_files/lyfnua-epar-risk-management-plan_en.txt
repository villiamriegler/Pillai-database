Brief description of the product
Chemical class
Gefapixant is an orally-active selective antagonist of the P2X3 receptor. The 
designation MK-7264 refers to the active free base that is delivered in the 
formulation as the citrate salt. The chemical name for gefapixant citrate salt is 5-
[(2,4-Diamino-5-pyrimidinyl)oxy]-2-methoxy-4-(1-
methylethyl)benzenesulfonamide. Gefapixant citrate salt has a molecular formula 
of C14H19N5O4S.C6H8O7 and a molecular weight of 545.52.
Structure:
Summary of mode of action
Gefapixant is a selective antagonist of the P2X3 receptor. Gefapixant also has 
activity against the P2X2/3 receptor subtype. P2X3 receptors are ATP-gated ion 
channels found on sensory C fibers of the vagus nerve in the airways. C fibers are 
activated in response to inflammation or chemical irritants. ATP is released from 
airway mucosal cells under conditions of inflammation. Binding of extracellular 
ATP to P2X3 receptors is sensed as a damage signal by C fibers. Activation of C 
fibers, which is sensed by the patient as an urge to cough, initiates a cough reflex. 
Blockade of extracellular ATP signaling through P2X3 receptors reduces 
sensory-nerve activation and cough.

PART II: SAFETY SPECIFICATION
PART II: MODULE SI - EPIDEMIOLOGY OF THE INDICATION(S) AND 
TARGET POPULATION(S)
Chronic cough
Worldwide, chronic cough is a common medical condition in adults; this condition prompts 
patients to seek a healthcare consultation that in turn may lead to referrals to respiratory 
specialists (including pulmonologists or allergists). The importance of cough as a clinical 
problem has led to multiple scientific societies publishing guidelines on the diagnosis and 
management of cough [Ref. 5.4: 04KQPD, 04KW7B, 03QMXM, 04KW9M, 04KQP6, 
05LJTX]. In these clinical guidelines, cough is categorized based upon duration. Cough in 
adults can be classified as acute (<3 weeks), subacute (3 to 8 weeks), or chronic (>8 weeks). 
Clinical guidelines [Ref. 5.4: 04N3R4, 0528XS] recommend that patients with chronic cough 
be evaluated for potentially treatable causes, including malignancy, infection, drugs known to 
cause cough, smoking or comorbid diseases known to be associated with chronic cough (e.g., 
asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), upper airway cough syndrome (UACS), or 
non-asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis (NAEB)) [Ref. 5.4: 04N3R4]. The majority of patients 
with chronic cough associated with an underlying condition respond to treatment for the 
comorbid condition; however, in a subset of patients, the cough is either refractory to 
treatment of the associated condition or no associated condition can be identified. Patients 
who have been diagnosed with conditions that are suspected to cause chronic cough, but 
whose cough does not resolve with the appropriate treatment are considered to have 
refractory chronic cough (RCC). Patients with chronic cough in whom an underlying 
etiology cannot be identified despite a thorough diagnostic workup are considered to have 
unexplained chronic cough (UCC).
Incidence:
The epidemiology of chronic cough is not well defined. Studies documenting the incidence 
of chronic cough are rare. A recent study estimated the incidence of chronic cough, using 
information collected as part of the Rotterdam Study, an ongoing prospective population-
based cohort study that investigates the occurrence and determinants of chronic diseases 
among participants aged â¥45 years in the Netherlands [Ref. 5.4: 05KGRG]. Chronic cough 
was assessed using standardized questionnaires and defined as daily coughing for at least 
3 months duration during the preceding 2 years [Ref. 5.4: 05KGRG].  During an average
follow-up of 6 years, 439 incident cases of chronic cough occurred with an overall incidence 
rate of 11.6 per 1000 person-years (95% CI 10.6â12.8) [Ref. 5.4: 05KGRG].
Prevalence:
Observational studies estimating the prevalence of chronic cough lack consistent validated 
epidemiologic definitions of chronic cough. In a global meta-analysis of 90 studies, utilizing 
studies with different definitions of chronic cough, the overall prevalence of chronic cough in 
the general adult population was 9.6% (95% confidence interval (CI), 7.6-11.7); the highest 
rates of chronic cough were reported in Oceania (18.1%; 95% CI, 9.8-27.2), Europe (12.7%; 
 
 
95% CI, 10.4-15.2), and the United States (11.0%; 95% CI, 7.8-14.4), with lower rates 
reported in Asia (4.4%; 95% CI, 1.8-7.4) and Africa (2.3%; 95% CI, 0.0-6.7) 
[Ref. 5.4: 04MLZM]. A study in southeast England of 9,077 patients reported a 12% 
prevalence of chronic cough, where chronic cough was defined as coughing at least half of 
the days of the year in patients 5 years of age or older[Ref. 5.4: 03QMXR]. A study in Italy 
of 18,000 people 20-44 years of age reported a 11.9% prevalence of chronic cough, where 
chronic cough was defined as having cough or phlegm on most days for at least 3 months of 
the year and for at least two successive years [Ref. 5.4: 05F889]. Of the 9,824 participants in 
the Rotterdam study, 10.9% of participants had chronic cough at baseline, where chronic 
cough was defined as minimum 3 months duration of cough during the preceding 2 years
[Ref. 5.4: 05KGRG]. An estimated 2% of the Japanese population ages 10 years and older 
may suffer from chronic cough, defined as cough lasting â¥ 8 weeks [Ref. 5.4: 04W32Z].
Chronic cough has been estimated to affect up to approximately 12% of the adult population 
recruited from primary care clinics in Europe, although there are prevalence estimates as low 
as 4% [Ref. 5.4: 03QMXS, 05FNJS, 05KGRG]. More recently, Kantar Health conducted the 
2018 National Health and Wellness Survey in five European countries, including France,
Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom [Ref. 5.4: 05GR0C]. (Henceforth, referred to 
as the 2018 European National Health and Wellness Survey). In this survey, approximately
5% of adults in each of these European countries self-reported experiencing chronic cough in 
the past 12 months and about 2% were diagnosed with chronic cough by a physician. In this 
cross-sectional survey chronic cough was defined as having a daily cough for at least eight 
weeks [Ref. 5.4: 05GR0C].  
Demographics of the population in the chronic cough indication: 
In a retrospective review of unselected patient referrals to 11 specialist cough clinics from 
Europe, North America and Asia, patients with persistent cough without significant 
radiological abnormality, were selected [Ref. 5.4: 05278V]. A total of 10,032 patients were 
seen in the clinics from November 2003 to March 2013 [Ref. 5.4: 05278V]. Two-thirds of 
the patients (n=56,591, 66%) attending the clinics were women [Ref. 5.4: 05278V]. The 
mean age Â± standard deviation (SD) was 55 Â± 14.97 years. The most common age for 
presentation was 60â69 years [Ref. 5.4: 05278V]. Similarly, in the 2018 European National 
Health and Wellness Survey, 63% of respondents self-reporting chronic cough were women 
and the mean age of respondents self-reporting chronic cough was 55 years 
[Ref. 5.4: 05GR0C]. In the 2018 National Health and Wellness Survey sample in the United 
States the one-year prevalence of chronic cough was 5.0%. In this sample, the prevalence of 
chronic cough in the previous 12 months (n=3,654) was higher among females than males 
(60.4% vs 39.6%), and those aged 50 years or older than aged 18-49 years (53.9% vs 46.1%)
[Ref. 5.4: 05JKLF].
Risk factors for the disease:
Common causes of chronic cough include asthma, GERD, UACS, and NAEB 
[Ref. 5.4: 0528XS].
 
 
Patients who have been diagnosed with conditions that are suspected to cause chronic cough 
(i.e., asthma, GERD, UACS, or NAEB) [Ref. 5.4: 0528XS] but whose cough does not 
resolve with the appropriate treatment of those conditions are considered to have RCC 
[Ref. 5.4: 05284T]. A retrospective United Kingdom study examining the etiology of chronic 
cough reported that treatment of the suspected cause was ineffective in resolving cough in 
17% (17/100) of patients [Ref. 5.4: 052DDS]. Patients with chronic cough in whom an 
underlying etiology cannot be identified despite a thorough diagnostic workup are considered 
to have UCC [Ref. 5.4: 05284T]. A retrospective study conducted in the United Kingdom
examining the etiology of chronic cough reported that an underlying cause could not be 
determined in 25% (25/100) of patients with chronic cough [Ref. 5.4: 052DDS].
Treatment options:
There are no medicinal products approved by the EMA or Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA)for the treatment of chronic cough, including RCC or UCC [Ref. 5.4: 052860]. In 
small randomized trials, the neuromodulating agents gabapentin and amitriptyline have 
demonstrated some benefit in patients with chronic cough [Ref. 5.4: 04Q6WR, 052D08], 
however, neither agent is approved for the treatment of cough [Ref. 5.4: 03RJ63, 052CWZ]
and both are associated with considerable adverse drug reactions, such as nausea, dry mouth, 
sedation and fatigue [Ref. 5.4: 04Q6WR, 052D34]. A small randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study in patients with RCC (N=27) demonstrated that treatment with low-
dose, slow-release morphine sulfate resulted in significant improvements in cough as 
assessed by the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) and daily cough scores 
[Ref. 5.4: 05F5H7]. Constipation and drowsiness were common adverse effects reported in 
trial participants who received morphine. While the American College of Chest Physicians 
(CHEST) guidelines do not recommend the use of morphine for the treatment of UCC or 
RCC based on limited clinical evidence [Ref. 5.4: 04Q70K], the more recently published 
European Respiratory Society (ERS) guidelines strongly recommend a trial of low dose slow 
release morphine (5-10 mg twice a day) for adults with RCC [Ref. 5.4: 05HD4X].
A 2013 review by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that, of the agents 
identified in the literature, opioid and certain nonopioid/non-anesthetic antitussives were the 
treatments that most frequently demonstrated efficacy for managing the symptoms of chronic 
cough, although the inconsistency of results, lack of reliable outcome measures and low 
overall strength of evidence is insufficient to draw firm conclusions [Ref. 5.4: 05284T]. 
Morphine, codeine, and dextromethorphan have also been considered as potential cough 
therapies and carry safety and potential abuse concerns with chronic use [Ref. 5.4: 05284T].
Natural history of the indicated condition in the [untreated] population, including 
mortality and morbidity:
The burden of chronic cough (>8 weeks) is long lasting, with some patients experiencing 
persistent symptoms that may continue for years despite numerous healthcare provider visits, 
treatment trials, and medical tests.  In a small double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover 
trial evaluating patients taking low-dose morphine for RCC (N=22), the mean duration of 
cough at baseline was 14 years [Ref. 5.4: 0527Y8]. In a prospective, observational study of 
patients with chronic cough, 46% (31/68) of patients continued to report regular cough 
 
 
5 years after the initial diagnosis and impairments in cough-related quality of life persisted in 
47% (32/68) of patients [Ref. 5.4: 052CHH]. In a longitudinal study of patients with UCC or 
RCC who were followed for 7 to 10 years after diagnosis, the mean duration of cough was 
11.5 years at the time of the final assessment, with 33% (14/42) reporting that their cough 
had worsened, 23% (10/42) that their cough was unchanged, 25% (11/42) that their cough 
had improved, and only 14% (6/42) reporting that their cough had resolved 
[Ref. 5.4: 052CTV].
Important comorbidities:
Common expected comorbidities and co-prescribed medicinal products
The incidence and prevalence of the comorbidities in the chronic cough, RCC, and UCC
patient populations are not well studied and often based on small sample sizes. As a result, 
there is often a wide range of estimates. 
The following are the best prevalence estimates of important common expected 
comorbidities for patients with chronic cough from the scientific literature and a listing of 
commonly co-prescribed medicinal products according to treatment guidelines for these co-
morbidities. This list of co-prescribed medicinal products is not exhaustive. 
Medical Conditions Associated with Chronic Cough
Asthma
In the prospective population-based Rotterdam study, 11.6% of the participants had asthma 
of the 1,073 participants in the Netherlands with chronic cough at baseline
[Ref. 5.4: 05KGRG]. More recently, in a longitudinal observational study of 75 adults with 
chronic cough attending a cough specialty clinic in the United States, 27.5% had asthma at 
baseline[Ref. 5.4: 0528XQ]. In a retrospective study of 11,290 patients in the United States 
with specialist-diagnosed chronic cough, 31% of patients had asthma [Ref. 5.4: 05G7NR].
Co-prescribed medicinal products include: Controller medications: Inhaled corticosteroids 
((ICS), pressurized metered-dose inhalers (pMDIs) or dry powder inhalers (DPIs)), inhaled 
corticosteroids and inhaled long-acting Î²-agonists bronchodilator combinations, leukotriene 
modifiers, and chromones (pMDIs or DPIs) [Ref. 5.4: 055QRD].
Add-on controller medications:  Long-acting anticholinergic, anti-IgE, anti-IL5, systemic 
corticosteroids [Ref. 5.4: 055QRD].
Reliever medications:  Short-acting inhaled Î²-agonists bronchodilator, low-dose 
ICS/formoterol, short-acting anticholinergics (pMDIs or DPIs) [Ref. 5.4: 055QRD].
Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
In the 2018 European National Health and Wellness Survey, 54% of self-reported chronic 
cough respondents reported having GERD, acid reflux or heartburn [Ref. 5.4: 05GR0C]. In a 
retrospective study of 11,290 patients in the United States with specialist-diagnosed chronic 
 
 
cough 44% of patients experienced frequent GERD [Ref. 5.4: 05G7NR]. In the prospective 
population-based Rotterdam study, 18.3% of the 1, 073 participants in the Netherlands with 
chronic cough at baseline had GERD [Ref. 5.4: 05KGRG].
Co-prescribed medicinal products include: Antacids, proton pump inhibitors, H2 receptor 
antagonists, promotility drugs [Ref. 5.4: 05H90J].
Non-asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis
In a longitudinal observational study of 75 adults with chronic cough attending a cough 
specialty clinic in the United States, 2.5% also had NAEB at baseline[Ref. 5.4: 0528XQ].
Co-prescribed medicinal products include: Inhaled corticosteroids, with add-on of a 
leukotriene inhibitor if not response to ICS [Ref. 5.4: 05H9QJ]. 
Upper airway cough syndrome
In retrospective study of 11,290 patients in the United States with specialist-diagnosed 
chronic cough, 20% had UACS [Ref. 5.4: 05G7NR]. More recently, in a longitudinal 
observational study of 75 adults with chronic cough attending a cough specialty clinic in the 
United States, 72.5% also had UACS at baseline[Ref. 5.4: 0528XQ].
Co-prescribed medicinal products include: Nasal application of H2-antihistamines, 
anticholinergic nasal spray First-generation antihistamines, decongestants 
[Ref. 5.4: 05HNZH].
Common Comorbidities in the Chronic Cough Population
Hypertension
In the 2018 European National Health and Wellness Survey countries, 38.3% of self-reported 
chronic cough patients reported having high blood pressure [Ref. 5.4: 05GR0C].  
Co-prescribed medicinal products include: Antihypertensive medications (Angiotensin-
converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blocker, beta blocker, calcium 
channel blockers, and diuretics) [Ref. 5.4: 05H90L].
Sleep apnea and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)
The 2018 National Health and Wellness Survey in the United States and the United Kingdom 
included respondents who self-reported having chronic cough, defined as having a daily 
cough for at least eight weeks. [Ref. 5.4: 05JKLF, 05JL5B]. In this survey, 16% (586/3654) 
of self-reported chronic cough patients in the United States and 10% (72/715) of self-
reported chronic cough patients in the United Kingdom reported having sleep apnea 
[Ref. 5.4: 05JKLF, 05JL5B]. Smokers are included in these estimates. No information on 
Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) treatment was collected.
 
 
In Taiwan, researchers conducted a retrospective cohort study of 131 patients who were 
referred to a sleep laboratory by thoracic physicians from January to June 2012. Of patients 
with OSA, 39% (39/99) had chronic cough, while only 12% (4/32) of patients without OSA 
had chronic cough. When OSA patients with chronic cough received CPAP, 67% (12/18) 
experienced a significant improvement in their chronic cough, whereas only 10% (2/21) of 
patients with OSA and chronic cough who did not receive CPAP experienced a significant 
improvement in their chronic cough [Ref. 5.4: 05MV3Z]. 
A retrospective review of records from a community-based pulmonary clinic in Utah from 
2005 to 2009 documented the prevalence of OSA among patients with chronic 
cough/bronchitis (cough lasting for eight weeks or longer). Of the 75 chronic 
cough/bronchitis patients, 44% had any OSA, of whom 27% had moderate or severe OSA
(with Apnea-Hypopnea Index >16) [Ref. 5.4: 05JCB0]. Improvement in cough was noted in 
93% (25/27) of patients who had initiation of new CPAP therapy or re-titration to optimal 
CPAP pressures. Six patients were not treated with CPAP and resolution of their OSA is 
unknown[Ref. 5.4: 05JCB0]. 
A prospective cohort of 76 patients with UCC (cough lasting longer than 8 weeks, but also 
including smokers) who were referred to a specialty respiratory center at National Jewish 
Hospital, found that 58% of these patients had OSA [Ref. 5.4: 05JC9Z]. Information on 
treatment with CPAP was not provided. 
OSA has been suggested as a potential risk factor for chronic cough. Further research is 
needed [Ref. 5.4: 05HD4X].
Potential Clinical Sequalae of Chronic Cough
Patients with RCC and UCC may experience substantial physical consequences, which may 
include stress urinary incontinence, sleep disturbance, breathlessness, chest pain, and, in 
some cases, severe effects such as cough-induced rib fracture or syncope [Ref. 5.4: 0528XV].  
In a prospective study of patients attending a pulmonary specialty clinic in the United States 
with a complaint of chronic cough, 53% (72/136) of patients indicated that physical effects, 
including broken ribs, retching, chest pains, or hoarseness, were among the negative 
consequences of their cough [Ref. 5.4: 0528XV].
Depression/ worsening of depressive symptoms
Prevalence: In a survey administered to adults residing in Europe with chronic cough of any 
cause, 91% (1000/1120) of respondents indicated that they experienced frustration and 
depression and 81% (890/1120) of respondents reported that their cough affected activities 
that they enjoy [Ref. 5.4: 04MMTF]. In a US study examining symptoms of depression in 
patients with chronic cough, 53% (53/100) of evaluated patients had significant depressive 
symptomatology and risk of clinical depression at the time of treatment initiation; 
improvements in cough scores after 3 months correlated significantly with improvements in 
depression scores (p=0.003; Spearman Ï = 0.323) [Ref. 5.4: 04MMZ4].
In the 2018 European National Health and Wellness Survey, 35.6% of self-reported chronic 
cough patients reported experiencing depression [Ref. 5.4: 05GR0C].  
 
 
Co-prescribed medicinal products include: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), 
serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine receptor) modulators (blockers), serotonin-norepinephrine 
reuptake inhibitors, dopamine-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase 
inhibitors, noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant, norepinephrine reuptake 
inhibitors, heterocyclic antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants) [Ref. 5.4: 05H9QK].
Dizziness
In a United Kingdom community survey of individuals who requested information about 
chronic cough in response to a radio broadcast, 26% (95/373) of respondents reported that 
they experienced dizziness associated with their cough [Ref. 5.4: 0527YB].
Headache
The 2018 European National Health and Wellness Survey, 54.2% of self-reported chronic 
cough patients reported having headaches [Ref. 5.4: 05GR0C]. 
Loss of productivity
Prevalence: In a prospective study of patients attending a pulmonary specialty clinic in the 
United States with a complaint of chronic cough, 22% (30/136) of patients reported 
absenteeism from work or school, demonstrating that chronic cough negatively affects the 
ability to work. Furthermore, 63% (85/136) of patients reported interference with speaking 
and 66% (90/136) reported exhaustion or poor concentration [Ref. 5.4: 0528XV]. 
Sleep disturbance
Prevalence: In a prospective study of patients attending a pulmonary specialist clinic in the 
United States with a complaint of chronic cough, 79% (107/136) of patients reported that 
they experienced sleep disturbance associated with their cough [Ref. 5.4: 0528XV]. In the 
2018 European National Health and Wellness Survey, 68.6% of self-reported chronic cough 
patients reported having a sleep condition, including sleep difficulties or insomnia
[Ref. 5.4: 05GR0C].  
Co-prescribed medications include: Sedatives, hypnotics including benzodiazepines, 
benzodiazepine receptor agonists, antidepressants, antipsychotics, antihistamines, 
phytotherapeutic substances and melatonin receptor agonists [Ref. 5.4: 05H90K].
Social isolation 
Prevalence: In a prospective study of patients attending a pulmonary specialty clinic in the 
United States with a complaint of chronic cough, 80% (109/136) of patients reported that 
cough interfered with lifestyle and leisure; 79% (107/136) reported emotional issues, 
including frustration, irritation, or anger; and a third of patients aged <65 years reported that 
their spouse or roommate slept in another room because of their cough [Ref. 5.4: 0528XV].
In a separate prospective study conducted in the United States examining the effects of 
chronic cough on quality of life (n=28), chronic cough had a similar effect to that of severe, 
 
 
disabling chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on multiple social domains, including 
ambulation, social interaction, sleep and rest, work, home management, and recreation
[Ref. 5.4: 04YYWM].
Syncope
In a United Kingdom community survey of individuals who requested information about 
chronic cough in response to a radio broadcast, 10% (37/373) reported that they experienced 
cough syncope associated with the chronic cough [Ref. 5.4: 0527YB].
Co-prescribed medicinal products include: Fludrocortisone acetate, midodrine
[Ref. 5.4: 05H90J].
Urinary stress incontinence
Prevalence: In retrospective study of 11,290 patients in the United States with specialist-
diagnosed chronic cough 6% experienced stress incontinence [Ref. 5.4: 05G7NR]. In a recent 
study of 200 women with chronic cough (cough lasting > 8 weeks) who were consecutively 
recruited at a cough specialty center from March 2018 to August 2020, 64% (127/200) 
reported urinary stress incontinence exclusively associated with a cough episode. Of these 
127 women, 119 (94%) reported that their urinary incontinence developed after the onset of 
their cough[Ref. 5.4: 05N08B]. In a longitudinal observational study of 80 adults with 
chronic cough attending a cough specialty clinic in the United States, a multivariable analysis 
demonstrated that lower cough-related quality of life was significantly associated with more 
severe urinary incontinence (P<0.0001) [Ref. 5.4: 0528XQ].  
Co-prescribed medicinal products include: Alpha1-antagonists, H1-receptor antagonists,
serotoninânoradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, anticholinergics, smooth muscle relaxants, 
tricyclic antidepressants, alpha-adrenergic agonists, and beta-3agonists.
Vomiting 
Prevalence: In a retrospective study, of 11,290 patients in the United States with specialist-
diagnosed chronic cough, vomiting was rarely experienced (0.9%) [Ref. 5.4: 05G7NR].
 
 
PART II:  MODULE SII - NON-CLINICAL PART OF THE SAFETY 
SPECIFICATION
Gefapixant has been evaluated in a comprehensive non-clinical safety assessment program to 
support oral administration in humans. This assessment included safety pharmacology 
studies, in vitro and in vivo genetic toxicity studies and repeat-dose oral toxicity studies up to 
3 months in duration in mice, up to 6 months in duration in rats and up to 9-months in dogs. 
Developmental and reproductive toxicity studies conducted with gefapixant included male 
and female fertility study in rats, embryo-fetal development studies in rats and rabbits, pre-
and post-natal toxicity study in rats. Placental transfer was evaluated in rats and rabbits and 
lactational transfer was evaluated in study in rats. In addition, a six-month oral 
carcinogenicity study in rasH2 transgenic mice and a two-year oral carcinogenicity study in 
rats were conducted with gefapixant. 
The important non-clinical safety findings are summarized in [Table SII.1]. In this document, 
the non-clinical/clinical exposure (AUC) and Cmax ratios are calculated based on the clinical 
AUC0-24hr for gefapixant of 8280 ng*hr/mL (AUCss 0-12hr of 4140 ng*hr/mL multiplied by 
2) and Cmax of 531 ng/mL achieved at the recommended human dose of 45 mg BID. 
Table SII.1:
Summary of Important Safety Findings from Non-clinical 
Studies
Key Safety Findings (from non-clinical studies)
Relevance to Human Usage
In a Phase 1 trial, healthy participants treated with gefapixant 
at 1800 mg BID for 14 days developed MK-7264 urinary 
crystals.  In the Phase 3 trials (P027 and P030) where 15 mg 
and 45 mg were evaluated, specialized urine testing to 
identify gefapixant urinary crystals and medical monitoring 
to identify reports of urolithiasis were conducted.  One 
participant in P030 in the 45 mg group was positive for MK-
7264 crystalluria at Week 52.  No renal findings were 
reported in that participant. Within the P027/P030 pooled
data, urolithiasis (i.e., nephrolithiasis, calculus urinary, 
calculus bladder and ureterolithiasis) was reported in 8 of 686 
participants in the 15 mg group, 4 of 683 participants in the 
45 mg group, and 3 of 675 participants in the placebo group. 
The product label for gefapixant contains information in the 
adverse events section on urolithiasis.
Toxicity:
Crystal-related uropathy:
Urinary crystal formation and tissue injury to kidney, 
bladder and ureter were observed in rat and dog studies up 
to six months in rats and nine months in dogs. Majority of 
crystals and calculi collected from the tissues in rat and 
dog studies identified/composed of MK-7264. Urinary 
crystals in both rat and dog chronic toxicity studies were 
observed at lower doses (up to 225 mg/kg/day in rats 
and up to 50 mg/kg/day in dogs) with no histopathology 
findings.
In the six-month repeat dose oral toxicity study in rats, 
crystals were observed in the urine at 75, 225 and 450 
mg/kg/day. Microscopic changes in the kidney (distended 
tubules due to presence of crystalline material, 
degeneration of epithelial cells lining tubules and 
inflammation in the interstitium), ureter (dilatation and 
inflammation) and bladder (transitional cell hyperplasia) 
were observed at 450 mg/kg/day (AUC0-24hr = 70700 
ng*hr/mL), and demonstrated reversibility following an 8-
week treatment free period. No observed adverse effect 
level (NOAEL) for the 6-month rat study was at 225 
mg/kg/day (4X and 7X the human AUC0-24hr and Cmax, 
respectively, at 45 mg bid).  
In the nine-month repeat dose oral toxicity study in dogs, 
crystals were observed in the urine at 25, 50 and 100 
mg/kg/day.  Microscopic observation of focal, minimal 
tubular degeneration, involving occasional cortical tubules 
was observed in one male dog at 100 mg/kg/day (AUC0-
24hr = 292000 ng*hr/mL) at the end of 9-month treatment 
 
 
Table SII.1:
Summary of Important Safety Findings from Non-clinical 
Studies
Key Safety Findings (from non-clinical studies)
Relevance to Human Usage
No evidence of carcinogenicity in non-clinical studies, 
therefore not a risk to humans.
Animal data do not indicate harmful effects of gefapixant 
with respect to fertility, pregnancy and embryo-fetal 
development. 
There are no data from the use of gefapixant in pregnant 
women. Gefapixant is not recommended during pregnancy 
and in women of childbearing potential not using 
contraception. 
It is unknown whether gefapixant is excreted in human milk.
No human data on the effect of gefapixant on fertility are
available. 
period. NOAEL for the 9-month dog study was at 50 
mg/kg/day (24X and 26X the human AUC0-24hr and Cmax, 
respectively, at 45 mg bid).
Carcinogenicity:
In a two-year carcinogenicity study in rats and 6-month 
carcinogenicity study in rasH2 transgenic mice, gefapixant 
showed no evidence of carcinogenic potential (no 
treatment related tumors) at exposures up to 9X (rats) and 
4X (mice) the human exposures. 
Reproductive / Developmental Toxicity:
Gefapixant had no effects on fertility, mating performance 
or early embryonic development in rats up to the highest 
dose tested, 675 mg/kg/day (approximately 9X the human 
AUC). 
Gefapixant showed no evidence of teratogenicity or 
embryo fetal lethality in rats and rabbits at exposures 
(AUC) that were 6X (rats) and 34X (rabbits) the exposure 
in humans. A slight reduction in rat fetal weights (6-7%), 
which was associated with maternal toxicity, was observed 
at an exposure approximately 11X the exposure in humans. 
In rabbits at a maternally toxic dose (due to decreases in 
food consumption, body weight loss and one abortion) of 
1500 mg/kg/day (approximately 34X the human exposure), 
no adverse effects on embryo-fetal development were 
observed.
Gefapixant had no effects on pre- and post-natal 
development in rats up to maternally toxic highest dose 
tested, 675 mg/kg/day (11X the exposure in humans). 
Studies in pregnant rats and rabbits showed that gefapixant 
is transferred to the fetus through the placenta, with fetal 
plasma concentrations of up to 21% (rats) and 25% 
(rabbits) that of maternal concentrations observed on 
gestation day 20.
Gefapixant was excreted in milk of lactating rats when 
administered orally (up to 675 mg/kg/day) on lactation day 
10, with milk concentrations 4 times that of maternal 
plasma concentrations observed 1-hour post dose on 
lactation day 10.
 
 
PART II: MODULE SIII - CLINICAL TRIAL EXPOSURE
As of 17-Sep-2020, across the gefapixant clinical development program, 2,413 participants 
received at least 1 dose of gefapixant in the completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 and Phase 3
(P027 and P030) clinical studies. Exposure to gefapixant is summarized in Table SIII.1. 
The Phase 1 program includes 18 completed studies (16 studies in healthy participants, 1 
study that included both healthy participants and participants with renal impairment, and 1 
additional study in participants with OSA). Across the completed studies, participants 
received gefapixant 10 mg to 1800 mg as single oral doses or 7.5 mg BID to 1800 mg BID 
for up to 14 days.
The Phase 2 program includes 13 completed studies.  Of the completed studies, 10 studies 
assessed the effect of gefapixant on cough: chronic cough (5 studies), cough due to IPF (2 
studies), cough due to viral-induced upper respiratory tract infection (1 study), and effect on 
cough reflex sensitivity (2 studies). Across the completed studies, participants received oral 
doses of gefapixant from 7.5 mg BID to 600 mg BID for up to 4 weeks and 7.5 mg BID to 50 
mg BID for 12 weeks. 
The Phase 3 program includes the 2 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, global 
studies (P027 and P030) that are pooled for the primary safety evaluation. The two studies 
had identical entry criteria and dosing regimens.  Each study had a Main Study period (12 
weeks for P027 and 24 weeks for P030) followed by an Extension Study period (40 weeks 
for Study P027 and 28 weeks for P030), for a total treatment duration of 52 weeks. As of the 
17-Sep-2020 database lock for this RMP, both studies are complete. The safety and 
tolerability assessment for the gefapixant chronic cough program relies predominantly on 
pooled data from Phase 3 studies. The exposure information for the pooled Phase 3 data is 
presented in Tables SIII.2 - SIII.5 below.

cough due to smoking do not meet the 
definition of RCC or UCC.  The 12-
month criterion was utilized because 
patients with chronic cough due to 
smoking show benefit from smoking 
cessation as early as 2 weeks but up to at 
least 6 months. 
This exclusion criterion was applied to 
ensure that the protocol was consistent 
with clinical practice/guidelines for the 
treatment of chronic cough
Gefapixant contains a sulfonamide 
moiety but is lacking an arylamine group 
(NH2) at the N4 position present in 
sulfonamide antimicrobials and is 
considered to be a non sulfonylarylamine. 
Despite information in the literature 
indicating that the risk of cross-reactivity
between gefapixant and sulfonamide 
antibiotics is low, this exclusion criterion 
was applied to avoid factors that may 
confound the evaluation of safety and 
efficacy in the trial.

Most major clinical guidelines 
recommend that ACE-Inhibitors should 
be discontinued if they are identified as a 
cause of cough as should other drugs that 
are known to cause cough.
Patients with a history of chronic cough 
suspected to be due to a drug do not meet 
the definition of RCC or UCC.
This exclusion criterion was applied to 
ensure that the protocol was consistent 
with clinical practice/guidelines for the 
treatment of chronic cough.
Elimination of gefapixant is primarily 
through renal excretion. A Phase 1 study 
(P026), including 6 participants with 
severe renal impairment (eGFR <30
mL/min/1.73 m2) and 6 participants with 
end-stage renal disease (ESRD)
(requiring hemodialysis) confirmed that 
participants with severe renal impairment 
would be expected to have higher drug 
exposure, to an extent that might be 
clinically meaningful.
This exclusion criterion was applied to 
avoid factors that may confound the 
evaluation of safety and efficacy in the 
trial.
Most major regional 
clinical guidelines for 
chronic cough
recommend removing 
drugs known to cause 
cough.  As such, this 
exclusion criterion will 
not be applicable in the 
post- marketing 
environment as the 
appropriate population is
defined in the labeling. 
Modeling of the effect of 
renal impairment on 
gefapixant PK, 
incorporating data from 
across the development 
program, support the 
dosing recommendations 
for severe renal 
impairment that are 
provided in the 
prescribing information
for gefapixant.

The clinical development programme is unlikely to detect certain types of adverse reactions 
such as rare adverse reactions, adverse reactions with a long latency, or those caused by 
prolonged or cumulative exposure.

Population
Pregnant women
Exposure
Not included as participants in the clinical development program 
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of gefapixant in pregnant or nursing 
women. There is no information regarding the presence of gefapixant in human milk, or 
the effects of gefapixant on milk production or a breastfed infant. Across the program, 
pregnant or nursing women were excluded from study participation. Pregnancies or 
exposure to gefapixant during nursing that occurred during study participation were 
reportable safety events. 
There were two pregnancies reported during the 52 weeks of the Phase 3 studies. One 
participant in the gefapixant 45 mg group, discontinued study intervention (last dose taken 
on Day 310) due to pregnancy and completed the study off treatment on Day 366. The 
pregnancy outcome was a vaginal live birth delivery at 39 weeks gestation on Day 676. 
No congenital anomalies were reported at birth.  Second participant, in the gefapixant 15 
mg group, discontinued study intervention (last dose taken on Day 182) due to pregnancy 
and completed the study off treatment on Day 366. The pregnancy outcome was a vaginal 
live birth delivery at 37 weeks gestation on Day 412. The infant was reported as having no 
congenital anomaly or other abnormality. 
Breastfeeding women
Not included in the pre-authorization clinical development program 
Pediatric patients

Participants with estimated 
glomerular filtration rate 
(eGFR) <30 mL/min/1.73 
m2
There is limited information on participants with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the 
clinical development program. One Phase 1 trial (P026) included 12 participants (6 with 
severe RI and 6 with ESRD requiring hemodialysis). These patients were not included in 
the Phase 3 program because they were not adequately studied prior to the initiation of 
Phase 3. If patients had a decrease in eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 during the course 
of the Phase 3 program, they were evaluated by the investigator to determine if they were 
appropriate to continue in the study.  There are no specific safety concerns related to 
participants with an eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2.  The prescribing information for 
gefapixant provides dosing recommendations for patients with severe renal impairment.  
 
 
PART II: MODULE SV - POST-AUTHORIZATION EXPERIENCE
SV.1
Post-Authorisation Exposure
As of 19-Jan-2023, gefapixant was approved in Japan (20-JAN-2022) and in Switzerland 
(24-MAY-2022) and is currently marketed in Japan. 
SV.1.1
Method Used to Calculate Exposure
A summary of the worldwide distribution of gefapixant, for the cumulative period of 20-
JAN-2022 [International Birth Date (IBD)] to 19-JAN-2023, is calculated from our 
Companyâs internal distribution data from the Financial Sharing Area database. Patient 
exposure estimates were calculated from expanded distribution categories to provide a more 
accurate estimate of patient exposure worldwide. The estimated patient exposure was based 
upon the assumptions that every patient will take two 45 mg tablets/day, 365 days/year and 
have 100% compliance.
It is important to note that the estimated Patient Years of Treatment (PYT) are not equivalent 
to the absolute number of patients treated. It should also be noted that the overall PYT 
estimates are likely to underestimate the true number of patients exposed to gefapixant, due 
to the fact that PYT estimates are a calculated number of patients who could have been 
treated for one year based on the tablets distributed. However, since most patients do not stay 
on therapy for a whole year, even for chronic conditions, the real number of patients is likely 
to be higher. 
SV.1.2
Exposure
Cumulatively, for the period of 20-JAN-2022 through 19-JAN-2023, approximately 
5,905,500 gefapixant 45 mg tablets were distributed. Cumulatively for this period, this 
accounts for approximately 8,090 Patient-Years of Treatment with gefapixant 45 mg tablets.
 
 
PART II: MODULE SVI - ADDITIONAL EU REQUIREMENTS FOR THE SAFETY 
SPECIFICATION
Potential for Misuse for Illegal Purposes
Gefapixant is available only through prescribing physicians and other health care providers 
with prescriptive authority. Neither gefapixant nor its components are known to possess 
addictive properties. 
The Marketing Authorization Holder (MAH) has not been made aware of any reports of
misuse for illegal purposes.
 
 
PART II: MODULE SVII - IDENTIFIED AND POTENTIAL RISKS 
SVII.1 Identification of Safety Concerns in the Initial RMP Submission
SVII.1.1 Risks Not Considered Important for Inclusion in the List of Safety Concerns 
in the RMP 
Reason for Not Including an Identified or Potential Risk in the List of Safety Concerns 
in the RMP:
Known risks that require no further characterisation and are followed up via routine 
pharmacovigilance namely through signal detection and adverse reaction reporting, and for 
which the risk minimisation messages in the prescribing information are adhered by 
prescribers (e.g., actions being part of standard clinical practice in each EU Member state 
where the product is authorised).
Hypersensitivity to sulfonamides
Hypersensitivity is a class-effect for sulfonamide antibiotics. Gefapixant contains a 
sulfonamide moiety but is lacking an arylamine group (NH2) at the N4 position present in 
sulfonamide antimicrobials and is considered a non-sulfonylarylamine.  Despite information 
that cross-reactivity between sulfonamide antibiotics and non-sulfonylarylamine, such as 
gefapixant, is considered unlikely, participants with a history of hypersensitivity to 
sulfonamides were excluded from the clinical program to avoid factors that may confound 
the evaluation of safety and efficacy of the clinical trials.  In addition to the likelihood of a 
hypersensitivity reaction being low, the diagnosis and management of a hypersensitivity 
reaction are standard clinical practice; therefore, this risk does not warrant inclusion in the 
RMP.  The warnings and precautions section of the label includes information stating that
gefapixant should be used with caution in patients with known hypersensitivity to 
sulfonamides. No additional risk minimization measures or additional pharmacovigilance 
activities are warranted.
Urolithiasis
In preclinical studies, crystals and calculi collected from tissues in rat and dog studies were 
identified/composed of MK-7264. Renal calculi or urolithiasis were not observed in Phase 1 
or 2 trials.  Within Phase 3 (P027/P030 Pool), 8 events of urolithiasis (calculus urinary [n=2], 
and nephrolithiasis [n=6]) were reported in the 686 participants in the  gefapixant 15 mg
group with 4 events of urolithiasis (calculus bladder [n=1], calculus urinary [n=2], and 
nephrolithiasis [n=1]) reported in the 683 participants in the gefapixant 45 mg group 
compared to 3 events of urolithiasis (ureterolithiasis [n=1]) and nephrolithiasis [n=2]) in the 
675 participants in the placebo treated group.  Events of urolithiasis were not dose-related,
and none of the participants with urolithiasis showed evidence of gefapixant urine crystals 
during protocol specified urine testing. These rates reflect a very low event rate of 1.4 per 
100 patient years and 0.8 per 100 patient years in participants treated with 15 mg BID and 45 
mg BID, respectively, compared to an event rate of 0.5 per 100 patient years in participants 
treated with placebo. Diagnosis, management, and prevention of urolithiasis is within 
standard clinical practice and does not require additional risk minimization measures or 
 
 
additional pharmacovigilance activities.  The specific preferred terms (PTs) for urolithiasis 
are included in the adverse reactions section of the label. 
Table SVII.1.1.1 lists adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reported in patients receiving 
gefapixant 45 mg twice daily in Phase 3 clinical trials at 52 weeks as reflected in the

Use in patients with comorbid obstructive sleep apnoea
Use in pregnancy and lactation
Gefapixant 45 mg BID, indicated for use in adults with 
RCC or UCC, is a peripheral acting antitussive with a 
novel mechanism of action (MOA). The mechanism of 
action of gefapixant does not support suppression of the 
natural protective cough reflex. Review of safety data from 
participants in the P027/P030 Pool at 52 weeks, shows a 
low incidence (<0.1%) of symptoms suggestive of a loss of 
protective cough reflex and low (<1.6%) and comparable 
incidences of the individual preferred terms for pneumonia 
in the placebo and gefapixant 45 mg groups. As a first in 
class molecule, the Agency has requested that âProgression 
of respiratory tract infections and risk of development of 
pneumoniaâ be included as an important potential risk.  
The inclusion of this missing information, to be followed 
post-approval with routine pharmacovigilance, may help to 
characterize the safety profile of gefapixant 45 mg BID in 
patients with RCC and UCC and comorbid OSA.
The inclusion of this missing information will characterize 
the safety profile of gefapixant in these populations and 
will further assist health care providers who are prescribing 
gefapixant to women for the treatment of RCC or UCC 
who are pregnant, may become pregnant or who are 
breastfeeding.

SVIII.2 Details of Important Identified Risks, Important Potential Risks, and Missing 
Information
SVIII.2.1 Presentation of Important Identified Risks and Important Potential Risk
Important Potential Risk - Progression of respiratory tract infections and risk of 
development of pneumonia
Potential Mechanisms: 
The MOA and the safety profile of gefapixant are well described in the SmPC. There is no 
known mechanistic basis for the potential risk of progression of respiratory tract infections 
and the risk of development of pneumonia. Gefapixant is a peripheral acting antitussive with 
a novel MOA that preserves the protective cough reflex.  P2X3 receptors are ATP-gated ion 
channels found on sensory C-fibers of the vagus nerve in the airways. While P2X3 mRNA is 
expressed by both jugular and nodose A-delta and C-fibers, the activation of these fibers 
differs. It is the A-delta fibers that are responsive to mechanical stimuli and thus serve as the 
primary mediators of protective cough. The A-delta fibers may provide a defensive 
mechanism for the airways from aspiration and can be activated to induce cough even in 
unconscious animals [Ref. 5.4: 07WQB3]. In contrast, the C-fibers respond to chemical 
stimuli, including ATP, and are involved in mediating inflammatory cough and chemically 
induced cough. In the Phase 3 safety data at 52 weeks, the overall incidences of AEs 
associated with pneumonia and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) were low (â¤4.5%). 
The incidences of the individual preferred terms for pneumonia and LRTI were also low 
(â¤1.6%) and comparable in the placebo and gefapixant 45 mg groups.
Evidence Source and Strength of Evidence:
Gefapixant is a first in class molecule for the treatment of RCC and UCC in adults. The 
indications for use, warnings and precautions, and the safety profile of gefapixant are well 
 
 
described in the SmPC. The Agency has requested that progression of respiratory tract 
infections and risk of development of pneumonia, be included as an important potential risk 
in the RMP. It is the opinion of the Agency that, as a first in class molecule, the mechanism 
of action for gefapixant is not fully explained and that further characterized of this important 
potential risk is needed.   
Characterization of the Risk: 
The overall incidences of AEs associated with pneumonia and LRTIs were low (â¤4.5%) in 
the placebo and gefapixant 45 mg groups. The incidences of individual pneumonia PTs 
(atypical pneumonia, pneumonia, pneumonia bacterial, pneumonia staphylococcal, and 
pneumonia streptococcal) were low (â¤1.6%) and comparable between the 2 groups (see 
Table). One participant in the gefapixant 45 mg group reported a serious AE of pneumonia 
(caused by Haemophilus influenzae); none were reported in the placebo group.

Risk Factors and Risk Groups:
Individuals with chronic cough experience a higher incidence of pneumonia, as well as, 
higher incidences of upper and lower respiratory infections, than individuals without chronic 
cough. These findings are from a retrospective observational cohort study conducted using 
administrative data from the Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) Research Data 
Warehouse among patients diagnosed with chronic cough and those without a diagnosis of 
chronic cough [Ref. 5.4: 05G7NR].
                                         
                                         
                                                                                                       
                                      
                                         
                                      
                            
 
 
Preventability: 
The SmPC for gefapixant under Section 4.1, Therapeutic indications, Section 4.2, Posology 
and method of administration, and Section 4.8, Undesirable effects provides information for 
healthcare professionals to inform on the safe use of gefapixant. Section 4.4, Special 
warnings and precautions for use, recommends that patients who develop an acute lower 
respiratory tract infection during treatment with gefapixant should consult a healthcare 
professional regarding care.  
Impact on the Risk-Benefit Balance of the Product:
This important potential risk will be monitored through routine pharmacovigilance activities 
and reported in the PSUR. Information that further characterizes the risk will be included in 
the PSUR and reported appropriately per regulatory requirements. 
Public Health Impact:
No public health impact related to progression of respiratory tract infections and risk of 
development of pneumonia would be anticipated.
SVIII.2.2 Presentation of the Missing Information
Use in patients with comorbid obstructive sleep apnoea
Evidence Source:
The safety profile of gefapixant 45 mg BID in patients with RCC or UCC and untreated 
comorbid obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is not known but is not expected to differ from the 
safety profile of gefapixant 45 mg BID in patients who either do not have OSA or who have 
adequately treated OSA.
In a study (P039) of 19 participants with moderate to severe OSA who were not using 
positive airway pressure (PAP), gefapixant 180 mg QHS compared to placebo was associated 
with a lower mean oxygen saturation (SaO2) and a higher proportion of time with SaO2 
<90% across all sleep stages but no difference in the Apnea/Hypopnea Index (AHI), which 
was the primary endpoint. The effect of gefapixant at doses other than 180 QHS on SaO2 has 
not been evaluated in any patient population.
The SaO2 findings in P039 are not expected to be a safety concern for patients with RCC or 
UCC. P039 tested a dose of gefapixant expected to achieve a higher exposure than is 
recommended for RCC and UCC, and the enrollment criteria for participants in P039, such as 
high AHI and lack of PAP treatment, made them particularly likely to have oxygen 
desaturation. OSA therapies (such as PAP) that mitigate apneic and hypopneic episodes also 
mitigate hypoxemia.
The AEs observed in P039 were generally similar to those in the P027/P030 Pool. No 
clinically meaningful trends were noted in the safety laboratories, vital signs, or ECGs with 
treatment with gefapixant.
 
 
In the P027/P030 Pool, approximately 6% of participants reported a medical history of sleep 
apnoea syndrome or apnoea. In this subset of participants, the overall incidences of AEs by 
intervention group were generally comparable to the incidences in the P027/P030 Pool.
Treatment of patients with OSA is considered standard clinical practice including the use of 
PAP to treat patients with moderate to severe OSA.  Additionally, some evidence suggests 
that OSA patients with chronic cough experience improvement in their chronic cough when 
treated with PAP [Ref. 5.4: 05MV3Z, 05JCB0]. 
The Special warnings and precautions section of the SmPC includes information stating that 
for patients with OSA, appropriate treatment for OSA should be considered prior to initiating 
treatment with gefapixant 45 mg BID.
Population in Need of Further Characterisation: 
The effect of gefapixant 45 mg BID in patients with RCC or UCC and comorbid OSA is not 
known. Study P039 was conducted in participants with OSA, not in participants with RCC or 
UCC and at a dose of gefapixant (180 mg QHS) expected to achieve a higher exposure than 
is recommended for RCC and UCC.
Use in pregnancy and lactation
Evidence Source: 
There are no adequate studies of gefapixant use during pregnancy or lactation. Across the
program, pregnant or nursing women were excluded from study participation.
No adequate human data are available to establish whether or not gefapixant poses a risk to 
pregnancy outcomes. Gefapixant use in women during pregnancy has not been evaluated. In 
animal reproduction studies, oral administration of gefapixant to pregnant rats and rabbits 
during the period of organogenesis showed no evidence of teratogenicity or embryofetal 
lethality at exposures (area under the curve [AUC]) that were 6 times (rats) and 34 times 
(rabbits) the exposure in humans at the recommended human dose (RHD). A slight reduction 
in rat fetal weights, which was associated with maternal toxicity, was observed at an 
exposure approximately 11 times the exposure in humans at the RHD. Prescribing 
information includes, as a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of 
gefapixant during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception.
It is unknown whether gefapixant is present in human milk, affects human milk production, 
or has effects on the breastfed infant. Gefapixant is present in the milk of lactating rats. In a 
lactation study, gefapixant was excreted in milk of lactating rats when administered orally 
(up to 675 mg/kg/day) on lactation day 10, with milk concentrations 4 times that of maternal 
plasma concentrations observed 1-hour post dose on lactation day 10. Prescribing 
information advises decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to 
discontinue/abstain from therapy with gefapixant while taking into account the benefit of 
breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.
 
 
We do not anticipate a risk to pregnant women. Pregnancies or exposure to gefapixant during 
nursing that occurred during study participation were reportable safety events. 
In the P027/P030 Pool, 2 participants (1 in the gefapixant 45 mg group and 1 in the 
gefapixant 15 mg group) discontinued study intervention due to pregnancies. Both full-term 
pregnancies resulted in live births. No congenital or other abnormalities were reported. There 
were no adverse event reports of maternal exposure during breast feeding during P027 and 
P030.
Based on a specific request of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), Use in pregnancy 
and lactation was added to the risk profile of gefapixant, classified as Missing Information.
Population in Need of Further Characterisation:
There are insufficient data from the use of gefapixant in pregnant women to determine the 
safety of gefapixant in infants exposed during pregnancy or while breastfeeding. Studies in 
animals have shown no evidence of teratogenicity or embryofetal lethality. Gefapixant was 
detected in breast milk in studies performed in rats. No studies have been performed to 
determine if gefapixant is released into breast milk of nursing mothers treated with 
gefapixant.

PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN BY PRODUCT
Summary of risk management plan for gefapixant tablets
This is a summary of the RMP for Lyfnua. The RMP details important risks of Lyfnua, how 
these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained about risks and 
uncertainties (missing information) of Lyfnua.
The SmPC for Lyfnua and its package leaflet give essential information to healthcare 
professionals and patients on how Lyfnua should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Lyfnua should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which 
is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of RMP 
for Lyfnua.
I.
The Medicine and What it is Used For
Lyfnua is authorised for treatment of refractory or unexplained chronic cough (see SmPC for 
the full indication). It contains gefapixant as the active substance and it is given by oral 
administration.
Further information about the evaluation of benefits of Lyfnua can be found in the EPAR for
Lyfnua, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the
medicineâs webpage.
II.
Risks Associated With the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further 
Characterise the Risks 
Important risks of Lyfnua, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about the risk of Lyfnua, are outlined below.
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
ï· Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;
ï·
Important advice on the medicineâs packaging;
ï· The authorised pack size â the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly;
ï· The medicineâs legal status â the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.
 
 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. In addition to these 
measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and regularly
analysed, including Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) assessment so that immediate 
action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance 
activities. 
II.A
List of Important Risks and Missing Information
Important risks of Lyfnua are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important 
risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there 
is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Lyfnua. Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information 
refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and 
needs to be collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine).

Risk factors and risk groups
Risk minimisation measures
Gefapixant is a first in class molecule for the treatment of 
RCC and UCC in adults. The indications for use, warnings 
and precautions, and the safety profile of Lyfnua are well 
described in the SmPC. While there is no mechanistic or 
clinical evidence indicating a risk of progression of 
respiratory tract infections and risk of development of 
pneumonia, this risk is included as potentially important 
recognizing that gefapixant is a first in class molecule and 
that further characterization of this important potential risk 
would be helpful.  
Individuals with chronic cough experience a higher 
incidence of pneumonia, as well as, upper and lower 
respiratory infections, than individuals without chronic 
cough.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Haemophilia A is a rare and serious, X-linked, recessive bleeding disorder that predominantly affects 
males and is characterized by a deficiency of FVIII. In patients with haemophilia A, the primary 
platelet-driven haemostasis is not affected, but generation of a stable, fibrin-rich clot is defective 
because inadequate amounts of thrombin are generated. Affected patients suffer from both 
spontaneous, non-traumatic bleeding episodes as well as substantially prolonged bleeding episodes 
upon injury. Rarely, life-threatening bleeding may also occur. Patients exhibit variable clinical 
phenotypes depending on the extent of residual activity (%) of the deficient FVIII that is used to 
classify the disease severity (WFH, 2012): 
• 
• 
• 
<1% FVIII activity: severe haemophilia A 
1% to 5% FVIII activity: moderate haemophilia A 
5% to 40% FVIII activity: mild haemophilia A 
Patients with severe haemophilia A bleed spontaneously into joints and muscles, which often results in 
permanent, disabling joint damage. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
The overall reported number of haemophilia A patients estimated in the 2013 survey by the World 
Federation of Haemophilia (WFH) included 107 countries with a total population of 6,461,067,861 and 
identified 140,313 people with haemophilia A (2.2 per 100,000 individuals). There are currently 
approximately 30,000 patients in the EU with a mean prevalence of approximately 0.6 patients per 
10,000. 
Haemophilia A is inherited as an X-linked recessive trait and the main risk factors are therefore family 
history and a carrier mother. Approximately 30% of patients have no family history of the disease; 
their disease is presumably caused by new mutations. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
The factor VIII/von Willebrand factor complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and von 
Willebrand factor) with different physiological functions. When infused into a haemophiliac patient, 
factor VIII binds to von Willebrand factor in the patient’s circulation. Activated factor VIII acts as a 
cofactor for activated factor IX, accelerating the conversion of factor X to activated factor X. Activated 
factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot 
can be formed. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
Haemophilia A manifests as profuse bleeding into the joints and muscles or internal organs, either 
spontaneously or as the result of accidental or surgical trauma. Recurrent joint bleeding can lead to 
chronic arthropathy, pain, and loss of function (Bolton-Maggs and Pasi, 2003). The majority of bleeding 
occurs internally into joints, most commonly hinged joints such as the ankles, knees, and elbows. 
Assessment report  
EMA/698571/2018  
Page 9/114 
 
 
 
 
 
Serious bleeds also occur in muscles, especially in deep compartments such as the iliopsoas, calf and 
forearm, and in the mucous membranes in the mouth, gums, nose, and genitourinary tract. Less 
frequently, life threatening bleeds can occur in or around vital areas or organs such as the 
gastrointestinal system or enclosed areas like the intracranial or intracerebral spaces. The approximate 
frequencies of bleeds at the different sites are: 70 to 80% in joints (haemarthrosis), 10 to 20% in 
muscle, 5 to 10% in the central nervous system, and < 5% for bleeds at all other sites (Srivastava et 
al., 2013). 
2.1.5.  Management 
Standard treatment for haemophilia A patients is the replacement of the missing protein by infusion of 
exogenous FVIII concentrates (as plasma-derived FVIII [pdFVIII] or recombinant FVIII [rFVIII] 
concentrates). Treatment regimens are either on-demand therapy (given when a bleed occurs) or 
prophylaxis (which consists of regular infusion of FVIII given every 2 to 3 days to prevent bleeding). In 
the short term, prophylaxis can prevent spontaneous bleeding and in the long term, prophylaxis can 
prevent bleeding into joints that will eventually lead to debilitating arthropathy. 
Prior to the introduction of clotting factor concentrates in the 1960s, the prognosis for haemophilia A 
patients was poor, average life expectancy being 15 to 25 years. Major advances in the safety of 
clotting factor products, including the availability of rFVIII concentrates, the availability of 
comprehensive haemophilia A treatment centres, the institution of routine prophylaxis, the introduction 
of home treatment, as well as the active roles that patients take in self-advocacy, have enabled 
patients with haemophilia A to lead a “close to normal” life. 
About the product 
Jivi is a recombinant B-domain deleted (BDD) human coagulation FVIII variant expressed in a baby 
hamster kidney cell line and site specifically conjugated with a 60 kDa branched polyethylene glycol 
(PEG) (two 30 kDa PEG).  Jivi was developed as a long-acting recombinant FVIII (rFVIII) with 
increased area under the curve (AUC) and an extended t 1/2 through reduced clearance from plasma by 
PEGylation while retaining the normal activity of the FVIII molecule.  
Jivi is supplied as powder and solvent for solution for injection together with a reconstitution device. 
The applicant claimed indication:  
Jivi is indicated in the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in previously treated patients (PTPs) ≥ 12 
years of age with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency). 
Posology: 
The posology for On Demand Treatment is proposed as follows: 
The calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 International 
Unit (IU) factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 1.5¬2.5 % of normal 
activity.  
The required dose of Jivi is determined using the following formula: 
Required units = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (% or IU/dL) x reciprocal of observed 
recovery (i.e. 0.5 for recovery of 2.0%). 
The amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to the 
clinical effectiveness in the individual case. 
Assessment report  
EMA/698571/2018  
Page 10/114 
 
 
 
 
 
In the case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the 
given plasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dl) within the corresponding period. The following 
table can be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery:

healing, 
then therapy for at least another 7 
days to maintain factor VIII activity 
of 30-60% 
(IU/dL). 
For prophylaxis the dose is 45¬60 IU/kg every 5 days. Based on patient clinical characteristics the 
dose can also be 60 IU/kg every 7 days or 30¬40 IU/kg two times per week. 
Paediatric population 
Jivi is not indicated in previously untreated patients (PUPs) and in patients less than 12 years of age. 
Method of administration: 
Jivi is for intravenous use. Jivi should be injected intravenously over a period of 2 to 5 minutes 
depending on the total volume. The rate of administration should be determined by the patient’s 
comfort level (maximal rate of injection: 2.5 mL/min).

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Jivi is a recombinant (r) PEGylated B-domain deleted (BDD) human coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) 
variant with the active substance (AS) damoctocog alfa pegol. The finished product (FP) is supplied as 
250 IU, 500 IU, 1000 IU, 2000 IU and 3000 IU/vial. Each dosage strength is reconstituted using sterile 
water for injection (SWFI). After reconstitution one mL of solution contains approximately 100 IU (250 
IU/2.5 mL); 200 IU (500 IU/2.5 mL); 400 IU (1000 IU/2.5 mL); 800 IU (2000 IU/2.5 mL) and 1200 IU 
(3000 IU/2.5 mL), respectively, of human coagulation factor VIII, damoctocog alfa pegol. Other 
excipients are: sucrose, histidine, glycine, sodium chloride, calcium chloride dehydrate, polysorbate 80, 
acetic acid and WFI. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
Damoctocog alfa pegol is a recombinant (r) PEGylated B-domain deleted (BDD) human coagulation 
factor VIII (FVIII) variant, which is site-specifically conjugated at a point cysteine mutation (K1804C) 
in the A3 domain, with a 60 kDa branched polyethylene glycol (PEG). The BDD rFVIII variant contains 
A1, a1, A2, a2, linker, a3, A3, C1, and C2 regions. The linker is a short 14 amino acid peptide 
(SFSQNPPVLKRHQR), which is composed of the first 3 amino acid residues of the N-terminus and 11 
amino acid residues of the C-terminus of the B-domain of full length FVIII. The BDD rFVIII variant is 
secreted from the recombinant production cell line as a heavy chain and light chain heterodimer which 
persists after PEGylation. 
The A1 and A3-C1-C2 domains each have two occupied N-linked glycosylation sites; an O-linked 
structure has also been identified. Additionally, there are six highly occupied tyrosine sulfation sites 
and one site in the A2 domain with low occupancy.

Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Manufacturing process 
The manufacture of damoctocog alfa pegol is considered to be a convergent process via the 
intermediates B-domain deleted (BDD) human coagulation factor VIII and Polyethylene Glycol 
Maleimide (PEG-Mal), each derived from their own starting material. The manufacturing process for 
damoctocog alfa pegol includes cell culture, harvest and isolation, and purification including viral 
filtration. Process flow diagrams for the different steps of the manufacturing process were provided. 
B-domain deleted (BDD) recombinant FVIII is produced in a baby hamster kidney 21 (BHK21) cell line.  
The BDD-rFVIII manufacturing process has been described in sufficient detail. It includes the 
preparation of the cell culture media and buffers. A list of process parameters has been given, 
including criticality assignment. Process hold times are adequately set out. 
The PEG-Mal has been correctly described in the dossier as an active substance intermediate.  
An overview of the manufacture of PEG-Mal has been provided.  
The adequacy of the control of the PEG-Mal to ensure finished product consistency, particularly with 
respect molecular weight distribution has been confirmed. As a consequence of the PEG-Mal being 
classified as an active substance intermediate, the PEG-Mal manufacturer is classified as a part 
manufacturer and therefore the GMP compliance of this manufacturer has been adequately confirmed. 
The manufacturing process and controls for the PEGylation process and the subsequent purification, 
substance bagging and storage have been defined to an appropriate level of detail. 
The rationale for criticality assignment of parameters controlling the process is found to be acceptable, 
as is the lifecycle management as defined.  
Control of materials 
No  material  of  direct  animal  or  human  origin  is  used  during  the  cell  culture  and  purification  process, 
except  for  the  cell  line.  The  raw  materials  used  in  the  manufacture  are  of  a  suitable  grade  for 
pharmaceutical manufacture.  
Raw materials have been adequately described and acceptance criteria have been adequately set out, 
as well as reference to internal testing where appropriate. 
The molecular cloning and the generation of the cell substrate has been adequately described. A two-
tier cell banking system of master (MCB) and working cell bank (WCB) is employed. The cell banks 
have been appropriately characterised. A protocol for the establishment of new WCBs has been 
provided. MCB and WCB are stored at appropriate sites and the MCB and WCB stock generated is 
sufficient for the foreseeable future, based on the information provided.  
Sufficient information on raw materials used in the  active substance manufacturing process has been 
submitted. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
The information provided on manufacture and control has been satisfactorily presented and the extent 
of characterisation considered appropriate. Potential impurities have been adequately summarised as 
part of this characterisation. 
Information on procedures for transfer of damoctocog alfa pegol active substance from the 
manufacturing site to the storage site has been provided.

Process validation  
The applicant has provided validation data for several active substance commercial batches and 
several finished product batches.  
Data for all critical and key performance parameters were provided and were within specification.  
Process development  
The process development was described satisfactorily. Design of experiment (DoE) studies were 
conducted for the cell culture conditions and to identify critical process parameters (CPPs). The 
outcome of the analysis is accepted. Studies were supplemented with univariate excursion studies for 
several parameters. 
The small-scale models supporting process development activity were suitably qualified.  
For the purification steps the applicant conducted a thorough analysis of process parameters and their 
impact based on experience with clinical and commercial batches. This was supplemented with studies 
on qualified small-scale models. 
Manufacturing process development of the PEG-Mal has not been discussed. This is accepted. 
Data showing relationship of process parameters for the purification process is to be taken from the 
release data for the phase III and conformance batches which demonstrate consistency in meeting 
specifications. Characterisation data supports evaluation of process parameters that are key, non-key 
or critical. The criticality ranking of process parameters and the operating ranges defined are accepted 
as being suitably qualified. 
The scale-down models are accepted as bridging the different scales used during development. 
Leveraging related data across the process developmental history in support of process performance 
across scales is accepted. The small-scale chromatography columns are suitable models for evaluating 
chromatography resin use life and viral clearance validation (evaluated at the end of the use life 
studies). 
The comparison of the phase III to the commercial (conformance) batches satisfactorily qualifies the 
change in manufacturing sites and the associated process adjustments for the post viral purification 
process. Stability performance between the phase three and conformance batches are equivalent. 
Extended characterisation qualifies claims of comparability between phase III and conformance 
batches in relation to the post viral PEGylation and purification process. 
Characterisation  
Satisfactory data pertaining to the structure of the recombinant protein has been provided. This 
includes elucidation of post translational modifications and physiochemical and biological properties of 
the AS and FP.  
The primary structure and post translational modifications for active substance damoctocog alfa pegol 
has been characterised by the standard methods for protein characterisation.   
The glycosylation profile (mono- and oligosaccharides) has been characterised as well as the common 
protein modifications oxidation, deaminidation and glycation. 
Results obtained by physicochemical analyses for clinical Phase III FP lots and conformance FP lots 
show these have equivalent conformational structure and thermal stability. Molecular weight 
distribution analysis indicated comparable profiles among the clinical lots, conformance lots and the FP 
reference standards. The determined molecular weights are consistent with expectations for the

polyethylene glycol modified rFVIII-BDD structure of damoctocog alfa pegol. The study of subvisible 
particles showed that the particle concentrations present in the clinical, conformance and reference 
standard lot were all comparable in magnitude, with similar vial-to-vial variability. There was no 
observed increase in particles related to storage under shelf-life or accelerated conditions. 
Biological functional characterization of the molecule indicate consistent functional activity results for 
the damoctocog alfa pegol FP product lots. The profiles are as expected for rFVIII and generally similar 
to non-PEGylated rFVIII-BDD. All clinical and conformance FP lots showed comparable results to the 
product reference standard. 
The glycosylation of the molecule was investigated. Methionine oxidation is described. 
Successful PEGylation of the protein is consistently demonstrated. It can be accepted that the control 
of damoctocog alfa pegol during its shelf life is stability indicating with respect to loss of PEG.   
The applicant has identified all cell culture derived impurities, their potential impact based on 
maximum permissible levels and the log clearance at relevant stages of the production process. 
Purification-derived impurities are shown as controlled and sufficient batches have been tested.  
Product-related impurities were identified and characterised, with sufficient control of impurities. 
Specification 
The list of test parameters for the active substance specification has been established in line with ICH 
Q6B and contain tests for appearance, identity, potency and purity.  
The specification used on the control of the finished active substance is satisfactory. The statistical 
method used to establish the proposed specification limits is noted.  
The shelf life limits specified have been satisfactorily derived. 
Analytical methods  
Analytical methods and their validation are satisfactory. Reference is made to Ph. Eur. methods where 
relevant. 
The method of potency estimation has been shown to generate similar potency estimates as would be 
determined by statistical methods described in Ph. Eur. 5.3.  
Batch analysis 
Batch data for several conformance batches manufactured at the proposed commercial scale have 
been provided. Full details of the batch genealogy have been presented. Batch data for development 
batches, which were or are to be used in clinical studies, were also provided and satisfactorily 
confirmed comparability of commercial and clinical batches. 
Stability 
The proposed shelf life and storage condition are -70°C ± 10°C for up to 24 months from the date of 
manufacture.  
Stress studies consistently qualify the stability-indicating nature of the analytical methods employed. 
The stability data provided for the clinical batches, for which the full 24-month stability data is 
available, is affirmative of the stability observed in the conformance batches. The data for the 
conformance batches stored at the long-term condition does not indicate any significant degradative

trend and met specs in force at the time of testing. All batches used for stability studies were stored in 
the same type container closure system, made from the same material as used for the commercial 
batches. 
Based on the stability data provided as required by ICH Q5C, the claimed shelf life and at the 
recommended storage conditions is considered acceptable. Within this period, damoctocog alfa pegol 
AS may be stored for up to 2 months at ≤ -36°C.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Damoctocog alfa pegol finished product is presented as a lyophilized powder for reconstitution as a 
parenteral solution. Dosages of 250, 500, 1000, 2000 and 3000 IU/vial are presented in glass vials, 
stoppered and sealed with an aluminium seal and plastic flip top. All the excipients (calcium chloride 
dihydrate, glycine, histidine, sodium chloride, sucrose, polysorbate 80 and acetic acid) comply with Ph. 
Eur. and are tested according to the compendial monographs.  
The finished product is reconstituted with 2.5 mL sterile water for injection (SWFI) for subsequent 
intravenous injection. 
Pharmaceutical development  
The pharmaceutical development has been sufficiently described.  
The damoctocog alfa pegol finished product is a lyophilized powder and is available in five dosages 
(250, 500, 1000, 2000 and 3000 IU/vial) using the same qualitative formulation excipient composition 
as Bayer’s commercial rFVIII products. A single fill size (2.5 mL) was developed for all five damoctocog 
alfa pegol finished product dosages. No changes were made to the finished product formulation 
between development, clinical studies and conformance lots. Stability data from the development 
studies showed that Bayer’s rFVIII commercial formulation was suitable for damoctocog alfa pegol 
finished product and provides the required stability during storage.  
Results from an international field study were presented to support the use of the chromogenic assay 
as an accurate method for measurement of damoctocog alfa pegol activity.The bulking and sterile 
filling processes used are established based on the commercial rFVIII processes for 2.5 mL fill size and 
are demonstrated to be suitable for manufacturing damoctocog alfa pegol finished product. The results 
showed that the finished product met the release and stability acceptance criteria. The freeze-drying 
process was also based on the commercial rFVIII process. The freeze-drying process for 2.5 mL vials 
has been demonstrated to be suitable using small scale studies and the combined results from the 
clinical batches manufactured using the commercial scale process met the acceptance criteria. No 
changes were made in the manufacturing process, facilities and equipment between Phase III clinical 
batches and conformance batches. The same bulking, sterile filling processes and freeze-drying 
process used for Phase III clinical manufacturing will be used for damoctocog alfa pegol commercial 
manufacturing. 
Clinical damoctocog alfa pegol finished product lots were manufactured using the commercial rFVIII 
freeze-drying process for 2.5 mL fill size at the sterile filling facilities. There was no difference in the 
freeze-drying process at the sites, except the capacity. 
The primary packaging components for damoctocog alfa pegol finished product are a glass vial and a 
stopper, closed with an aluminium seal. The vials meet the Ph. Eur. requirements for Type I glass and 
the stoppers are of pharmaceutical grade. The validation of the container closure integrity was 
Assessment report  
EMA/698571/2018  
Page 16/114 
 
 
 
 
 
confirmed. Compatibility and in-use stability of primary packaging components was demonstrated with 
reconstituted finished product. Extractable studies were performed on the finished product primary 
packaging components and demonstrated that these are acceptable. 
Compatibility of damoctocog alfa pegol finished product with sterile WFI with the vial adapter 
(reconstitution device) and with several types of administration sets (infusion set with needle for 
injection) from different suppliers intended for commercial application has been demonstrated. The 
information provided is satisfactory. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Damoctocog alfa pegol finished product manufacturing process involves thawing of the frozen active 
substance, dilution to appropriate target potency (for the 250/500/1000/2000 IU/vial dosages) with 
formulation buffer, sterile filtration and mixing, filling into vials, subsequent lyophilization, stoppering 
of vials prior to unloading, crimping with an aluminium seal, inspection and packaging. The finished 
product fill size is 2.5 ml per vial for all dosages. Storage is at 2 to 8°C. Details have been given for 
the critical process parameter limits and maximum processing times for each of the manufacturing 
steps and flow charts were submitted. Intermediate controls are performed for bioburden and 
endotoxin.  
Process Parameters for the FP Final Bulk formulation, filling, freeze-drying and vial capping processes 
were well controlled and the critical quality attributes were consistently met for the validation FP 
conformance batches.  
Process validation 
The process validation strategy involved process unit validation studies and manufacturing of 
conformance batches. FP vials from the conformance batches were included in a stability programme 
designed to support shelf life assignment. The validation studies successfully demonstrated consistency 
and reproducibility of the FP manufacturing process. The batch release results showed that all 
conformance batches met the release acceptance criteria specified in the validation protocol. The 
potency and specific activity results were consistently met for all conformance batches except in one 
case, but additional batches were produced and provided reassurance that the manufacturing process 
is consistent. In addition, the safety related results (sterility and endotoxin) also met the release 
specifications for all FP conformance batches. 
The validation studies confirmed that the finished product process results in lyophilized finished 
product batches with consistent product quality. 
Product specification 
Release and shelf-life specifications have been provided for all vial sizes of damoctocog alfa pegol (250 
IU, 500 IU, 1000 IU, 2000 IU and 3000 IU). Specifications and acceptance criteria have been set in 
accordance with regulatory requirements and commitments for evaluation of specification limits have 
been made. 
Specifications are the same for all presentations for appearance, clarity and colour, solubility time, pH, 
osmolality, moisture content, particulate matter, uniformity of dosage, identity and purity / impurities, 
sterility, endotoxin and excipients (glycine and histidine, sodium and calcium, sucrose and polysorbate 
80). The only differences are in potency (chromogenic potency assay for rFVIII in IU/mL) and protein 
content (total protein in µg/mL) for the five presentations and these were used to calculate the specific 
activity of samples (IU/mg) which is common for all the presentations.

Analytical procedures  
Analytical procedures have been described in sufficient detail. Method transfer was verified. 
Compendial tests were also verified, including uniformity of dosage, quantitation of particulate matter, 
sterility and endotoxin. 
Batch analysis 
Batch information and test results for damoctocog alfa pegol finished product (FP) conformance 
batches are provided for each potency (250 IU, 500 IU, 1000 IU, 2000 IU and 3000 IU). All batches 
were manufactured at the proposed commercial scale at the Bayer Berkeley site (USA). 
Batch information for damoctocog alfa pegol finished product batches used in preclinical, clinical and 
stability studies are given; all test results for these batches met the acceptance criteria.  
Elemental impurities in the finished product (FP) were evaluated in a risk-based approach in 
accordance with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities 2014. Elemental impurities levels 
were determined in clinical and conformance FP lots. Trace metals that are required in the cell culture 
media during fermentation were included in the testing programme. 
Data from several lots from Phase III clinical batches and conformance batches were used in 
determination of release and shelf life specification limits. It is noted that several different active 
substance batches were used in manufacture of these finished product batches, which provides a broad 
range of data based on different batches and combinations of active substance/finished product. 
Specification limits were based on regulatory requirements, alignment with Bayer rFVIII marketed 
products (Antihaemophilic Factor (recombinant) Formulated with Sucrose (rFVIII-FS) and BAY 81-8973 
full length rFVIII), historical range and/or statistical analysis of Phase III clinical and conformance run 
data. Phase III clinical stability data has also been considered where appropriate. 
Reference standards 
Assay results have been provided for Product Reference Standards. An established protocol will be 
used for the introduction of subsequent product reference standards, with specification limits revised in 
line with the agreed finished product specification limits. 
Details of characterisation of potency standards are given. Potency values were assigned against the 
WHO 8th International Standard; the in-house working standard is tested annually against the WHO IS 
to confirm potency stability. The applicant has demonstrated that the in-house calculation is equivalent 
to the Ph. Eur. calculations. Linearity and parallelism between the in-house standard and the WHO 8th 
International Standard have been shown. Based on this, the labelling of the reference standard in IU is 
accepted. 
Stability data were provided for storage of the reference standards. 
Container Closure system 
The primary packaging system is comprised of a 10 ml Type 1 glass vial, a grey bromobutyl rubber 
stopper and aluminium overseal with plastic flip-off top. The vial and stopper comply with Ph. Eur. 
requirements. The medical devices are CE marked, CE certificates and relevant information have been 
provided. 
Stability of the product 
The proposed shelf life for damoctocog alfa pegol finished product lyophilisate at 2 - 8°C is up to 24 
months from the date of manufacture. Within this period, damoctocog alfa pegol finished product is 
Assessment report  
EMA/698571/2018

proposed to be stored stored for up to 6 months at up to 25°C, or up to 3 months at up to 30°C. At 
the end of this period the product should not be put back in the refrigerator, but should be used or 
discarded. 
Based on the conformance and clinical real-time long-term stability data collected in line with ICH and 
the trend analyses performed for the conformance and clinical batches at 2 - 8°C storage condition and 
cycle conditions, damoctocog alfa pegol finished product is stable and meets all acceptance criteria and 
support the proposed shelf life. The two cycle conditions supported a further 9 months (total 27 
months), or storage of samples for 21 months at 2 - 8°C with subsequent storage at 30°C/75%RH for 
a further 6 months (total 27 months). Furthermore, accelerated and stress condition stability studies 
have been performed according to ICH Q5C. The results obtained from these support the relevance of 
the selected stability indicating parameters.   
The post-reconstitution study demonstrated that damoctocog alfa pegol is stable for 3 hours post-
reconstitution at room temperature and meets the stability acceptance criteria. From a microbiological 
point of view the product should be used immediately after reconstitution. If not used immediately, the 
in¬use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user. 
Photostability studies demonstrated that the secondary packaging provides adequate protection to the 
product vials against the effects of light exposure. Since slight light sensitivity has been demonstrated 
under extreme light exposure conditions without secondary packaging, an instruction keep the product 
in the outer carton in order to protect from light is included in the SmPC. 
Based upon the data from real-time long-term, cycle conditions and accelerated studies for the 
conformance and clinical batches, damoctocog alfa pegol finished product is expected to be stable at 2 
- 8°C for up to 24 months. Within this period, damoctocog alfa pegol finished product may be stored 
for up to 6 months at a temperature up to 25°C. At the end of this period the product should not be 
put back in the refrigerator, but should be used or discarded. 
Adventitious agents 
Assurance of viral safety of damoctocog alfa pegol active substance and finished product is based on 
the three complementary approaches as defined by ICH Q5A; selecting and testing cell lines and raw 
materials of human or animal origin for viral contaminants, evaluating the virus clearance capacity of 
the purification process, and testing the product at appropriate steps for contaminating viruses. 
The master cell bank (MCB) and end of production cells (EOP) has been extensively tested for presence 
of endogenous and adventitious viruses according to ICH Q5A, using both unspecific and specific in 
vitro and in vivo assays. The MCB and EOP cells were positive for reverse transcriptase (RT) activity. 
However, further examination of the MCB and EOP cells revealed no identifiable virus-like particles 
other than budding C-type retrovirus-like particles (RVLP), which are generally known to be present in 
BHK cells. As the MCB and EOP cells were negative for retroviruses in the additional retrovirus specific 
tests performed, the positive RT activity observed is concluded to originate from the endogenous RVLP 
present in the BHK cells. Apart from the observed RVLPs, no other virus was detected in cells from 
neither MCB, WCB, nor in the EOP cells. Thus, the overall test results demonstrate that the cell banks 
for damoctocog alfa pegol are virologically safe for clinical or commercial manufacturing.   
Raw materials are used for the damoctocog alfa production are selected, controlled and documented. 
No animal or human derived raw materials were used for establishment of the MCB or WCB. The raw 
materials used in the manufacture are of a suitable grade for pharmaceutical manufacture.

In order to minimise the risk of potential virus contamination or process carry-over during 
manufacturing, physical segregation of pre- and post-virus reducing steps is present for both upstream 
cell culture and downstream purification processes. Materials and equipment used for the virus 
reducing steps are either single-use or decontaminated and sanitised, according to validated 
procedures. The measures applied in order to minimise the risk of introducing adventitious viruses and 
for contamination by process carry-over is considered adequately described and acceptable.  
The design of and results obtained from the performed virus clearance studies are in accordance with 
ICH Q5A and acceptable. 
In addition to the viral clearance capability demonstrated for the manufacturing process, the extensive 
testing of cell substrates and unprocessed bulk, the control of raw materials and manufacturing 
process, and the environmental monitoring and test control programs enables the damoctocog alfa 
pegol finished product to be considered as virologically safe. 
In conclusion the testing programme of cell banks for virus contamination is considered adequate. No 
adventitious viruses have been detected. The capacity of the manufacturing process for 
removal/inactivation of viral contamination is also considered acceptable and meets the requirements 
of the relevant guidelines.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Development, characterisation, manufacture and control of damoctocog alfa pegol active substance 
and finished product have been adequately and sufficiently described. 
The applicant has submitted a dossier of acceptable standard. The documentation provided 
demonstrates that the validated production process, control of active substance and the control of 
finished product will lead to production of a finished product with a consistent and acceptable quality. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Sufficiently detailed data and documents have been provided indicating that the product can be 
reproducibly manufactured and is adequately controlled. The quality of this product is considered to be

Based on the review of the quality data provided, the CHMP considers that the application to the 
marketing authorisation for Jivi is approvable from the quality point of view. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
1. The applicant is recommended to continue the development and implementation of an assay as 
committed. 
2. The applicant is recommended to re-evaluate the specification limits as committed.

The in vitro studies confirm the ability of Jivi to reduce the clotting time of rabbit, dog and human 
plasma, similar to that seen for BAY 14-2222, Kogenate FS, a full length and unmodified FVIII product. 
These clotting effects also confirm the relevance of the rabbit species for use in toxicology studies.   
Damoctocog alfa pegol shows similar efficacy to non-PEGylated FVIII molecules in all tested bleeding 
models (HemA mice and HemA dogs). Damoctocog alfa pegol appears to have a longer t½, which leads 
to a prolonged efficacy duration relative to non-PEGylated FVIII molecules. 
One of the models used was in the haemophilia A mouse tail vein transection model using survival as 
endpoint. The study report CB-2010-12 indicates that time to re-bleed and animal activity was noted in 
Assessment report

the first 9-11h after the tail vein transection. Both models are considered to be pharmacologically 
relevant to determine the effects of and characterise the product under development.  
To further explore the potential mechanism of reductions in efficacy and increased hypersensitivity 
observed in young patients administered Jivi in the clinical studies the applicant has conducted a range 
of exploratory studies. These studies suggest that Jivi initiates an anti-PEG response following 
extended dosing of an IgM isotype, and not IgG driven. This suggests a T-cell independent response 
due to Jivi. This was further described in a study in HemA mice and in an in vitro study with dendritic 
cells, in which Jivi has been shown to be less immunogenic than an un-pegylated variant of FVIII. The 
consequences of the reduced efficacy and increased hypersensitivity observed in young patients will 
have to be addressed at a clinical level.   
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
No dedicated pharmacodynamic interaction studies have been conducted. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamic studies were performed. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
No dedicated safety pharmacology studies have been conducted with Jivi. Safety pharmacology 
parameters of CNS and renal function have been incorporated into the design of a 2-week repeated 
administration toxicity study in rats.   
Jivi is a large PEGylated protein and both, rFVIII and PEG, are considered safe and well known 
molecules with an extensive non-clinical experience and regulatory history. Neither rFVIII nor PEG are 
known to have effects on vital organ systems such as nervous system (CNS), cardiovascular system, 
and the respiratory system. As a result, no separate safety pharmacology studies of Jivi according to 
the ICH S6 were considered necessary. 
Except for the amino acid that contains the PEG moiety and the deletion of the inactive B-domain, the 
rFVIII protein in Jivi has the same amino acid sequence as BAY 81-8973 (Kovaltry) and Kogenate FS 
(BAY 14-2222). Previously BAY 81-8973 was tested in a cardiovascular safety pharmacology study 
after a short IV infusion in anesthetised beagle dogs and in a respiratory safety pharmacology study 
without revealing clinically significant effects. 
The applicant has also reviewed recent literature review (Webster, et al, 2007) which indicates that 
PEG associated with a biological molecule should not provide extra concern as PEG has already been 
thoroughly investigated in animals. The data contained in literature indicate that the PEG associated 
with a protein or other biological molecule does not represent an additional unknown risk to humans. 
Reference is also made to other pegylated biologicals such as PEGylated interferon alpha-2a 
(PEGASYS) and methoxy PEG epoetin-beta (Mircera) where it was shown that cardiovascular and 
respiratory safety pharmacology data in monkeys or dogs are similar to those observed for the 
unmodified parent compound and that the PEGylation do not reveal any specific adverse events linked 
to the PEG moiety.

Effects of Jivi on CNS and renal function were studied in male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats (aged 8 
weeks at start) after IV administration in a 2-week toxicity study (dosing every other day followed by a 
recovery period of 4 weeks) of 0 (vehicle), 75, 750 and 2250 IU//kg.  In addition, BAY 14-2222 
(Kogenate FS) was tested at the dose of 2250 IU/kg. 
Nervous System 
Effects of Jivi on CNS function were studied in male rats after IV administration on day 1 of the 2-week 
toxicity study. After intervals of 15 minutes, 4 h and 24 h following drug or vehicle administration, 
parameters of the central nervous, autonomous, neuromuscular and sensomotoric system, as well as 
various critical parameters of body physiology (e.g. behavior, locomotor activity, gait, muscular tone, 
extensor and flexor spasm, ptosis, catalepsy, motor coordination, grip strength, rectal temperature, 
pain sensitivity, righting reflex, pupillary, corneal and pinna reflex, respiration) were investigated.   
Jivi and the reference compound BAY 14-2222 up to the highest dose did not show effects different to 
vehicle-treated animals. 
Renal Function 
Effects of Jivi on renal function were studied in male rats after IV administration on day 3 of the -week 
toxicity study. Urine was collected for 5 h after iv administration of the test items. At the end of the 
urine collection, a blood sample was taken from each animal. The following parameters were 
determined: urine volume, electrolyte excretion (Na+, K+), creatinine excretion, N-acetyl-β-D-
glucosaminidase (NAG), total protein, creatinine clearance, serum urea and creatinine concentration, 
and osmolar clearance.   
At all doses tested with Jivi there were no significant changes compared to vehicle animals. For 
reference BAY 14-2222 kidney function remained unchanged except of a slightly elevated osmolar 
clearance due to enhanced potassium excretion.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interactions were performed (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The non-clinical PK development program with Jivi comprised single-dose PK studies in rats and rabbits 
as well as toxicokinetic investigations after repeated administration in the systemic toxicity studies in 
these species.  
Additionally, distribution/excretion studies were performed in rats with BAY 1025662, the 60 kDa PEG-
60-linker-Cysteine (PEG-60-Mal-Cys). Single-dose PK studies with the estimated human lifetime dose 
of 11 mg/kg 60 kDa PEG either as PEG-60-Mal-Cys or 14C labelled PEG-60-Mal-Cys were performed in 
rats.  Methods were developed by the applicant to detect levels of Jivi, BAY 14-2222 and the 60 kDa 
PEG element (PEG-60-Mal-Cys, BAY 1025662) in rats and rabbits. These methods utilised FVIII activity 
assays and ELISA systems to quantify and detect levels of Jivi, BAY 14-2222, plus anti-drug antibodies 
to FVIII, levels of neutralising antibodies to FVIII and anti-PEG antibodies. LC-MS/MS methods were 
used to quantify levels of BAY 1025662 in the dedicated PK studies to evaluate the fate of the PEG 
moiety from Jivi.

Single dose studies were completed in rats and rabbits with Jivi which demonstrated dose-proportional 
increases in systemic exposure, both for Cmax and AUC, and exposure was broadly linear. The plasma 
clearance was very low with max clearance ranging from 3 mL/h/kg to 5.5 mL/h/kg, for FVIII and PEG 
components, respectively. The Vss was also low in both species with about 0.05-0.07 L/kg. The plasma 
elimination half-life (t1/2) of Jivi observed in rats and rabbits were in the range of 8 to 12 hours, 
respectively, this data was obtained from figures generated from the anti-FVIII antibody assay. Figures 
are presented for the elimination half-life of PEG, figures obtained from the use of an anti-PEG 
antibody and were 6.7 to 10 hours, in rats and rabbits, respectively. Elimination of the PEG component 
is examined in more detail below, however the Expert indicates that overall there is a 1.8-fold increase 
in rats, and a 1.3-fold increase in rabbits in terminal t1/2 with the pegylated product over the un-
pegylated marketed product, BAY 14-2222, also known as Kogenate FS.   
In the multiple dose studies in rats and rabbits over a 2-week period supported the overall linear 
exposure over increasing dose. In rats, exposure measurements on Day 13 were noticeably lower, and 
in rabbits, levels of plasma Jivi were below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ). This is likely due to 
generation of anti-drug antibodies which is to be expected on extended dosing to a non-immune-
compromised animal species.  However, there was evidence in the male rat studies of accumulation of 
Jivi in animals treated in the mid-dose level (750 IU/kg/day), however these findings are difficult to 
substantiate due to concerns of ADA formation.   
No dedicated distribution, metabolism or elimination studies were conducted with Jivi, in accordance 
with ICH S6(R1). 
PK of BAY 1025662 (PEG-60-Mal-Cys) 
In order to estimate the possible consequences of chronic exposure to pegylated medicinal products, 
the applicant has calculated a maximal clinical dose of once or twice weekly 60 IU/kg of Jivi would 
result in maximum exposure of µg/kg/week of PEG.  This was estimated to result in a cumulative 
amount of approximately 11 mg/kg over 60 years with once weekly dosing and 30 years with twice 
weekly dosing of 60 IU/kg of Jivi.   
The excretion and distribution behaviour of BAY 1025662 was investigated in rats in order to evaluate 
the behaviour of the PEG-linker moiety of the drug Jivi. After the single dose of the estimated human 
lifetime dose of [14C] labelled PEG-60-Mal-Cys 11 mg/kg to rats, elimination was quite high, there was 
a total recovery of radioactivity (cumulative excretion plus residues in the animals) of 88.6% at the 
end of the mass/balance study on day 168 (urine day 231). This may be related to the relative size of 
the pegylated linker, a similar effect has been seen in the literature which suggests increased 
elimination half-lives for larger sized PEG moieties. Examination of the distribution of the PEG moiety 
indicates distribution to blood, lung, liver, kidneys, and to lower extent to bone, brain and skeletal 
muscle. The exposure in testes was approx. 2-fold higher than in blood pointing to a high blood/testes 
penetration, although it is highlighted that no findings in testes were detected in the toxicity studies, 
following high doses, and with repeated administration.   
Exposure measurements also draw up the high exposure (AUC) of [prop-14C]BAY 1025662 in the 
choroid plexus (126,000 mg-eq·h/L), Harderian gland (106,000 mg-eq·h/L), and spleen (98,000 mg-
eq·h/L).  The findings on the choroid plexus is of some concern given the safety issues previously 
highlighted with pegylated molecules that result in cell vacuolation observed mainly in cells of the 
choroid plexus and the kidney. There is relatively high exposure of [prop-14C]BAY 1025662 to the 
choroid plexus, as observed in the rat distribution study (PH-39641), and the elimination from the 
choroid plexus appears to have a very long elimination half-life (117 days). Other pegylated 
Assessment report  
EMA/698571/2018  
Page 25/114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
compounds such as N8-GP and Refixia (N9-GP), each with 40 kDa PEG moiety’s, showed a similar 
distribution pattern alongside slow elimination rates, as was observed with the PEG compound BAY 
1025662. No signs of cellular vacuolation was observed in the repeated dose toxicity studies completed 
in the rat and rabbit, however these studies were of limited duration (4 weeks) and so the potential 
long-term effects of PEG-induced accumulation cannot be conclusively demonstrated.  There is limited 
data for the long-term safety of the 60 kDa PEG, however some reassurance can be made by the data 
that has been provided for a 40 kDa PEG compound, and with the data from the long-term study in 
Rowett rats completed with Jivi.   
In rats, the elimination half-life of the radio-labelled PEG compound was 23 days in blood, and 24 days 
in plasma, and elimination half-lives ranged from 31 days to 68 days in organs such as the kidney.   
2.3.3.  Toxicology 
A non-clinical program was conducted to characterise the in vivo and in vitro toxicological and 
toxicokinetic profile of Jivi, and of its representative PEG moiety, BAY 1025662.  
Rats and rabbits were selected as non-clinical species for toxicological assessments as both are 
relevant species and where Jivi has been shown to be active in their coagulation cascade. Only male 
animals were used in most of the toxicology studies, since males compose the majority of the 
haemophilia A patient population.   
Single dose toxicity 
Extended systemic single dose IV GLP toxicity studies in male rats and rabbits were conducted to 
evaluate the effects of single high doses of BAY 94-9027.  Animals was treated on day 1 followed for 1 
or 14 days. For the extended acute toxicity studies with BAY 94-9027 in rats, which included clinical 
pathology and histopathology, the highest dose was limited to 4000 IU/kg (67 fold over the clinical 
dose of 60 IU/kg) due to the sensitivity of rats to glycine used as one of the excipients in BAY 94-
9027.  For the rabbit studies, the highest dose of 4000 IU/kg was selected based on the limitation by 
the administration volume of 10 mL/kg that can ethically be given to rabbits. No adverse effects were 
seen in the single-dose toxicology studies in rats and rabbits up to the highest dose of 4000 IU/kg. 
Separate extended acute toxicity studies in male rats and rabbits were conducted with the PEG moiety 
used in Jivi. There were no effects up to the highest doses tested (210 mg/kg in rats and 20 mg/kg in 
rabbits) 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Jivi: Repeat-dose studies were limited to 2 week durations with Jivi, this was in line with advice 
obtained by the applicant from CHMP and other regulatory authorities, and in addition animals were 
treated with IV doses of Jivi or BAY 14-2222 every other day for 14 days until neutralising antibodies 
developed.   
In male and female rats and in male rabbits, Jivi was administered at doses of 75, 750 or 2250 IU/kg.  
Overall the formulation of Jivi was well tolerated in both species after repeated administration over 2 
weeks.  There was no evidence of treatment-related mortality, there were no noted effects on 
behaviour, or no relevant changes in organ weights were observed. One of the only findings of note 
was 1 incident of thrombophlebitis in a female rat treated with 2250 IU/kg Jivi. This was not replicated 
in male rats, or in other females treated at the same dose level. Rabbits were more sensitive to 
changes, and there was some evidence of changes to liver and spleen tissue at the high dose level of 
2250 IU/kg, represented by condensed cytoplasm of hepatocytes and increased amount/size of 
Assessment report  
EMA/698571/2018  
Page 26/114 
 
 
 
 
 
germinal centres in white pulp follicles in the spleen. These organ changes are likely immune driven in 
response to human recombinant compounds being injected.   
More importantly there was no sign of effects indicative of PEG driven toxicity, i.e. cell vacuolation, 
however given the length of time of dosing with Jivi, this effect may be significantly under-represented 
in these studies. In terms of overall exposure, the increasing emergence of Anti-Drug Antibodies 
(ADAs) and neutralising antibodies (NAbs), as expected resulted in lower exposure to either Jivi or the 
un-pegylated BAY 14-2222, although the effect was more pronounced in animals treated with BAY 14-
2222. It is also noted that anti-PEG antibodies were absent in both rats and rabbits exposed to Jivi. As 
a consequence the NOAEL in each study was the highest dose tested (2250 IU/kg), which overall 
represents a dose which is 38-times the highest clinical dose of 60 IU/kg.  
The applicant is currently running a 6-month toxicity study with recovery groups in immune-deficient 
Rowett nude male rats. The interim study report for the chronic Rowett nude rat study has been 
supplied in the assessment, however the finalised study report will not be provided until the end of 
2018 following review of data obtained from 26-week recovery animals. Animals were dosed with three 
levels of Jivi, at 40, 400 and 1200 IU/kg twice weekly. The updated report includes further 
histopathological data from control and all dose groups, as opposed to just the control and high dose 
groups previously reported. The following organs and tissues were examined: liver, kidney, lungs, 
spleen, adrenals, brain with choroid plexus, mandibular lymph nodes, spinal cord and macroscopic 
lesions.  Tabulated and individual summaries are provided in the amended pages of the report. No 
significant changes are reported with the new data. There were limited variations, with no changes 
noted for the choroid plexus, kidney or spleen. There was no sign of PEG accumulation in the brain, 
and there was no correlate of PEG residue in CSF samples. This data does support similar findings 
generated with another PEGylated Factor VIII compound, N8-GP, and is reassuring to support 
conclusion for safety on the longer-term use of Jivi.   
Outstanding data remains to be reported on the recovery animals in the study, however it is unlikely to 
alter the overall conclusions from the interim report. The data presently does not indicate that there 
will be PEG accumulation or toxicological changes in the organs of interest. 
BAY 1025662: In a similar way, 4-week studies were conducted in male rats and rabbits, except with 
the PEG-linker compound, BAY 1025662. The effects of BAY 1025662 were assessed by clinical 
parameters, biochemistry, haematology and coagulation parameters, urinalysis, as well as 
determination of liver enzyme activity and full post-mortem examination. BAY 1025662 was injected 
intravenously, every other day over a 4 week period with a 4 week recovery period in rats, and a 13 
week recovery period in rabbits. BAY 1025662 was well tolerated up to the highest dose tested in rats 
(11 mg/kg) and rabbits (2 mg/kg).  In rats the only noteworthy finding was of a slight decrease in 
oxygenase conjugation enzymes, although is not considered to be adverse. In rabbits, there were no 
significant or noteworthy findings. In both species, histological examination revealed no development 
of cellular vacuolation, the potential effects related to administration of a pegylated compound. The 
length of duration of exposure is limited however. The duration of treatment was designed to employ 
very high doses of the PEG compound, frequently over 4 weeks in order to induce a PEG-related effect 
instead of performing a longer-term study. There are also arguments that this type of study design 
would represent a ‘worst case’ scenario as higher levels of PEG would accumulate in the animals. 
Evidence of accumulation of BAY 1025662 in both rats and rabbits confirms already established 
knowledge of the slow elimination of PEG compounds, and this would have implications for longer 
term, chronic toxicity effects.   
The NOAEL in these studies was the highest dose tested, 11 mg/kg in rats, and 2 mg/kg in rabbits. 
Overall PEG dose given in the highest anticipated clinical dose of 60 IU/kg BAY 94 9027 is maximally 4 
Assessment report  
EMA/698571/2018  
Page 27/114 
 
 
 
 
 
µg/kg, assuming a maximal twice weekly prophylactic dose resulting in approximately 8 µg/kg/week. 
This represents a 4800-fold margin of PEG compound in 60 IU/kg of Jivi over one month in the rat; 
and in the rabbit, up to 2 mg/kg twice weekly is equal to 500-fold of PEG-60 in 60 IU/kg of Jivi. 
Genotoxicity 
No genotoxicity studies have been performed. Since Jivi is a biological compound; no genotoxicity 
studies are expected in line with ICH S6.   
A standard genotoxicity screen was conducted with BAY 1025662, the PEG moiety of Jivi. The in vitro 
and in vivo studies were negative and confirm that the 60 kDa linker compound would not expect to 
increase genotoxic risk on administration with Jivi.    
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies have been performed (see discussion on non-clinical aspects).  
Reproduction Toxicity 
Reproductive toxicity: 
No developmental or reproductive toxicity studies were conducted with Jivi, the absence of these 
studies has been justified as males comprise the vast majority of patients with haemophilia A, and in 
the clinical trials conducted with Jivi, only male patients were recruited. There is a range of data 
available from other compounds of rFVIII on development, fertility and reproduction which does not 
suggest developmental effects. The applicant has reviewed the effects of Jivi on male reproductive 
organs in the 2-week repeat dose studies in rats and rabbits, no treatment related effects were noted. 
Similarly, the effects were reviewed from 4 week studies with BAY 1025662 in male rats and rabbits 
which also do not show effects on fertility or changes to the male reproductive organs.   
Juvenile toxicity: 
The applicant has completed two studies in juvenile rats, one study to examine the effects of Jivi in 
neonatal male rats (aged from postnatal day 17 – PND 17), and the second study to explore the 
effects of the PEG-linker moiety, BAY 1025662 in neonatal male rats (PND 17).    
These juvenile toxicity studies were conducted with Jivi (0, 200 and 1000 IU/kg) and BAY 1025662 
(0.4 and 2 mg/kg) administered twice per week for 4 weeks.  No significant toxicological findings were 
noted in these 4 week studies to suggest increased adverse effects in a neonatal population. Further 
discussions are provided in response to findings emerging from the rat juvenile toxicity study with Jivi. 
A detailed breakdown of the clinical observations has been supplied and tabulated, indicating that the 
only clinical signs such as mortality and respiratory findings were related more with procedural or 
technical causes rather than with an issue with treatment. Findings include hypothermia, decreased 
motility, piloerection and accelerated breathing. No specific changes or effects to behaviour have been 
highlighted. Renal cellular effects appear to be absent from histological examination with both Jivi and 
BAY 1025662 in juvenile rats. It should be noted the short duration of exposure to these compounds, 
limited due to emergence of ADAs in rats on extended dosing.   
Toxicokinetic data 
To monitor exposure, toxicokinetic investigations were performed in the pivotal toxicology studies with 
Jivi in rats and rabbits during 2 weeks of repeated administration. Since Jivi is a large molecule of 230 
Assessment report  
EMA/698571/2018  
Page 28/114 
 
 
 
 
 
kDa no scaling was performed when comparing to human exposure. Toxicokinetic investigation 
demonstrated that in all species, the systemic exposure achieved was substantially higher than in 
humans at the maximum recommended therapeutic dose. The table below summarises PEG levels 
employed in the toxicology studies with BAY 1025662 in comparison the clinical amount of PEG in Jivi. 
Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance was assessed as part of the 2-week toxicity studies in rats and rabbits. No significant 
signals for local intolerance were observed. The only notable findings were noted in the female rat in 
which an instance of Thrombophlebitis was observed only in one of the two lateral tail veins. Since 
there was no increase in the inflammatory response in the other high dose animals at the application 
site when compared to controls, this finding was attributed to mechanical injury of the vein on 
administration.   
Other toxicity studies 
A number of additional studies were completed with Jivi in order to understand other toxicity endpoints 
such as immunogenicity, ability to activate complement cascades and tissue cross reactivity. 
In the study to explore the potential antigenicity, Jivi was evaluated whether it increased antigenicity 
in the presence of the PEG moiety. Haemophilia mice were treated with either Jivi, or with BAY 14-
2222, and formation of binding and neutralising anti-FVIII antibodies compared. Treatment with Jivi 
resulted in less binding and lower amounts of neutralising antibodies in comparison to the un-
pegylated BAY 14-2222.   
Complement activation was examined in vitro using serum obtained from healthy volunteers, and 
formation of complement factors measured in an ELISA. Jivi did not increase activation of complement 
factors, and neither did its PEG moiety (60 kDa) or other PEG compounds of other sizes. It unlikely 
therefore that activation of complement cascade would be influenced on treatment with Jivi.   
In the final study, Jivi was evaluated for potential tissue cross reactivity (TCR). Binding was compared 
to BAY 14-2222, an un-pegylated rFVIII compound. Overall Jivi showed comparable binding to BAY 14-
2222, i.e. to the heart, endothelial cells in the kidney and to the lung. It is agreed that it is unlikely 
that pegylation of the rFVIII domain increases the tissue binding of Jivi over un-pegylated rFVIII 
compounds. 
No concerns are raised in terms of impurities in the drug substance or product.  
PEGylated compound risk assessment: 
A detailed review of the safety of pegylated molecules was provided. This focuses primarily upon the 
published literature, of which has been extensively reviewed over the past decade. PEG molecules are 
generally regarded as inert, highly water soluble and they have no specific receptor or other target 
proteins in tissues.  Literature suggests that the primary toxicological effects of PEG is cellular 
vacuolation, although this is not considered to be adverse if there is an absence of morphological 
changes in the surrounding tissue. The applicant has supplied a risk assessment of the potential effects 
of PEG accumulation due to Jivi, and extrapolation for the safety data established with other marketed 
pegylated compounds has been used. The Applicant highlights that data on 20, 30 and 40 kDa PEG 
appear linear, and therefore it is possible to extrapolate to the longer 60 kDa PEG used for this 
product. The CHMP Safety Working Party, in 2012 released a response position paper on the effects of 
PEGylated drug products in the paediatric population intended for long-term treatment, which the 
applicant has discussed to some extent. The concern for cellular vacuolation represents the body’s 
Assessment report  
EMA/698571/2018  
Page 29/114 
 
 
 
 
 
response to remove foreign material, in this case the PEG moiety. The tissues of interest centre on the 
renal tubular epithelium and the choroid plexus epithelium, and cellular vacuolation is a risk with 
compounds of PEG molecular weight ≥40 kDa, is emergent following treatment shorter than 4 weeks 
and with a cumulative PEG dose of 0.4 µmol/kg/month. The PEG content in Jivi over 1 month would be 
>750-fold below this arbitrary level. Potential exposure to a PEG moiety in Jivi is very low.  In the risk 
assessment of the PEG moiety, the applicant has chosen to use a life-time duration of treatment of 
only 30 years.  
The high dose level of 11.0 mg/kg BAY 1025562 in the 4-week repeat-dose toxicity study in rats was 
selected to represent the cumulative life-time clinical dose of maximally 4 µg/kg (the estimated 
maximal amount of PEG-60 in a Jivi dose of 60 IU/kg) given twice weekly for 30 years.   
Adverse effects and cell vacuolation have not been observed in any of the completed toxicological 
studies completed with Jivi or with the PEG moiety, BAY 1025662. Study durations are limited to no 
more than 2 weeks in the Jivi studies which unfortunately limits the exposure data to the pegylated 
compound, although margins for safety are calculated from studies with BAY 1025662. The studies 
with BAY 1025662 (PEG-60-Mal-Cys) did not demonstrate any tissue vacuolation at high exposures of 
PEG compared to the clinical dose (up to 4800-fold in rats and 500-fold in rabbits). There was also an 
absence of anti-PEG antibodies in studies in rats and rabbits. Some concerns have been raised in terms 
of safety pharmacology endpoints and whether the concern of effects to the renal and CNS have been 
adequately characterised in young enough animals, in addition the pharmacokinetic distribution studies 
with labelled BAY 1025662 shows distribution to the choroid plexus, and elimination half-lives are 
significantly extended with BAY 1025662 compared to the Jivi compound.   
2.3.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Jivi is a recombinant replacement protein of the naturally occurring coagulation factor VIII. It is 
catabolised during human metabolism and no active molecule is excreted by the patient. In accordance 
with the guideline CHMP/SWP/4447/00 (1), Jivi as a protein is exempted from an environmental risk 
assessment since proteins are unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment.  
2.3.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The pharmacology and pharmacokinetic and toxicity studies performed showed that Jivi has similar 
pharmacology, pharmacokinetic and toxicology profile compared to the approved un-pegylated FVIII 
(Kogenate/Kovaltry). Jivi has been formulated with the same excipients, and tolerability in the repeat-
dose toxicity studies was similar between the pegylated and un-pegylated FVIII product. 
Pharmacodynamic studies evaluated Jivi in haemophilia A mouse and dog efficacy models 
demonstrated restoration of haemostasis, and there was extended efficacy in the pegylated product in 
comparison to a comparable un-pegylated product.   
In the methods used to examine the levels of Jivi in rats and rabbits, the applicant has defined the 
extent to which each of the components in the final drug product - protein/linker/PEG, could be 
detected. Single dose studies in rats with the radiolabelled PEG moiety showed that there was no 
indication of retention or irreversible binding of radioactivity in the animal body. Specifically, the 
applicant highlights that no residual radioactivity was detected in the brain of the PEG moiety, 
indicating that the radio-labelled compound does not cross the blood brain barrier. There are high 
levels of exposure seen in the testes, choroid plexus, Harderian gland and spleen, which indicates the 
potential of risk on fertility, and of cell vacuolation associated with pegylated compounds. Excretion of 
the 60 kDa PEG moiety of Jivi via urine and faeces was demonstrated. Slow elimination rates of PEG 
Assessment report  
EMA/698571/2018  
Page 30/114 
 
 
 
 
 
was observed in the rat distribution study for organs and tissues such as the kidney, blood and plasma, 
the elimination half-life of the radio-labelled PEG compound was 23 days in blood, and 24 days in 
plasma, and elimination half-lives ranged from 31 days to 68 days in organs such as the kidney.   
Studies in adult and juvenile animals did not identify age specific effects related to Jivi or PEG, 
however it should be noted that the data is limited to cover only patients aged 12 years and above. 
Doses several-fold higher than the recommended clinical dose did not demonstrate significant signals 
for toxicity in single and multiple dose toxicity studies in rats and rabbits. A 6-month chronic toxicity 
study in immune-deficient Rowett nude male rats is completed and the Applicant is recommended to 
provide the final study report once available. Dedicated toxicity studies conducted with the PEG moiety 
alone did not demonstrate significant toxicity in single and multiple dose studies in rats and rabbits. An 
updated review of the accumulated data on other pegylated compounds is supplied, to also consider 
the extrapolations made with smaller sized PEG to the 60 kDa PEG used for Jivi.   
Jivi was evaluated in pharmacology, single and repeated dose as well as juvenile toxicity studies in rats 
and rabbits. In a long-term, 6-months chronic toxicity study no indication of PEG accumulation or other 
effects related to administration of Jivi were seen. In addition 4 weeks toxicity studies with the PEG 
moiety of Jivi were conducted in two species. The PEG-linker moiety was also tested in a standard set 
of in vivo and in vitro genotoxicity studies and they did not indicate a potential for genotoxicity. These 
studies did not reveal any safety concerns for humans. 
Single dose studies in rats with the radio-labelled PEG moiety showed that there was no indication of 
retention or irreversible binding of radioactivity in the animal body. Specifically, no residual 
radioactivity was detected in the brain, indicating that the radio-labelled compound did not cross the 
blood brain barrier. In distribution and excretion studies in rats, the 60 kDa PEG moiety of Jivi was 
shown to be widely distributed to and eliminated from organs and tissues, and excreted in urine 
(68.4% up to day 231 after administration) and faeces (13.8% up to day 168 after administration). No 
long-term studies in animals to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of Jivi, or studies to determine the 
effects of Jivi on reproduction have been conducted. 
2.3.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
From a non-clinical perspective, the application is approvable.   
The applicant is recommended to provide the final study report in immune-deficient rats once data 
from recovery animals is complete.

Ongoing 
In the Phase 1 study, PK and safety of Jivi were evaluated following single and multiple dose 
administration in two cohorts (N = 7) of previously treated male patients with severe haemophilia A.  
In this study, the patients also received a single dose of Kogenate FS to compare the PK of Jivi with 
that for Kogenate FS.  In the PROTECT VIII study, PK was evaluated in a subgroup of 22 patients 
following the first dose, and in 16 of the 22 patients after multiple doses.  In the PROTECT Kids study, 
PK was evaluated in 16 patients in the age group < 6 and 18 patients in age group between 6 to < 12 
years.  The PK data on whole is limited and focuses on prophylaxis treatment where less frequent 
dosing is used rather than for the on-demand treatment. 
The PK data is reasonably consistent across studies and dose proportional increases were seen for AUC 
and Cmax between the doses of 25 and 60 IU/kg Jivi.  The data shows a lower clearance for Jivi 
compared to Kogenate FS, the t 1/2 was 17.6 hrs and CL was 0.016 dL/h/kg based on chromogenic 
assay and the t 1/2 was 17.4 hrs and CL was 0.015 dL/h/kg based on one-stage assay, this compares to 
T1/2= 13 h for Kogenate FS.

Exposure was similar following 6 months of treatment in the phase II/III study and 8 weeks of dosing 
in the phase 1 study.  Consistent with the half-life, accumulation was minimal following weekly and 
biweekly dosing. 
Plasma FVIII concentration data from the phase I study 13401, phase II/III study 13024 and phase III 
study 15912 were included in a population PK analysis. Overall data from 206 male subjects (age 
range from 2-62) containing either full PK profiles (up to 168 hrs post-dose) and/or sparse samples 
(pre-dose and recovery samples collected at approximately 15-30 minutes post injection) were 
available for the analysis.  Important covariates were lean body weight and VWF factor on Clearance, 
and lean body weight on volume. The exponents for lean body weight on clearance and volume are 0.7 
and 0.87; similar to those expected for allometry where typically body weight is considered. Time 
dependency in PK was evaluated in the model and shows no unexpected time dependency.

The population PK model was used to predicted time to reach certain threshold and the FVIII 
concentration at certain time points following a dose of 60 IU/kg. For ages ≥12 years, these numbers 
show that for approximately 50% of patients a maintenance of FVIII level above 1 IU/dL over 
approximately 5 days is expected, while for some patients a FVIII levels above 1 IU/dL could also be 
expected for over 7 days. Simulations were also provided for some of the more frequent posology 
indicated in the SmPC.  The expected peak concentrations if injection was given over 2 min (worst 
case) and at an interval of 8 hrs for 2 doses were predicted for a dose of 50 IU/kg as 219.8 (167.3-
290.5) IU/d after the second dose. These expected concentrations are within the range of 
concentrations seen in the clinical program without any safety finding.   
In the popPK the typical subject >50 yrs of age had a 21.5% lower CL than a subject < 50 yrs, there is 
not data in those over 65 yrs old.  The current indication is for children >12 years. No significant ethnic 
differences were observed for Asians and Non-Asians with respect to pharmacokinetic properties.

Jivi is a modified recombinant replacement protein of the naturally occurring coagulation FVIII and is 
not metabolized by liver enzymes, it is not expected that hepatic impairment will affect the PK of Jivi. 
Since renal excretion is not expected for the FVIII part of Jivi, no PK studies in patients with renal 
impairment have been conducted. However, the major excretion pathway of the PEG moiety of Jivi is 
expected to be via the kidney.  
Pre-existing ADAs were detected in a total of 21 patients and were mainly anti-PEG IgM antibodies with 
negative results in the Jivi neutralizing assay. Antibody titers were low. Consistent with the negative 
results in the neutralising assay, Jivi post-infusion activity after the first injection was in the expected 
range for FVIII recovery for most patients. In some patients, slight decreases in the Jivi activity after 
the first injection and low Jivi recoveries (<1.5 IU/dL per IU/kg) were observed in the presence of anti-
PEG antibodies which normalised when antibodies disappeared. Antibody status was not tested as a 
covariate in the population PK analysis as the incidence (<5% of the PK population) was below the pre-
specified criteria. The individual predicted Cl and V for 8 patients with anti-PEG IgM antibodies were 
within the population average estimated for different age groups and indicated that the presence of 
antibodies did not affect clearance. 
Absorption  
No studies performed considering that the route of administration for damoctocog alfa pegol is 
intravenous. 
Distribution 
The volume of distribution was low, and the mean value was ~0.40 dL/kg based on chromogenic assay 
and 0.37 dL/kg based on one-stage assay.  These values are based on combining the data from Study 
13401 for both low and high dose and data from PROTECT VIII study;  
Elimination 
Jivi is a modified recombinant replacement protein of the naturally occurring coagulation factor FVIII. 
It is not metabolized by liver enzymes.  
The t 1/2 was 17.6 hrs and CL was 0.016 dL/h/kg based on chromogenic assay and the t1/2 was 17.4 hrs 
and CL was 0.015 dL/h/kg based on one-stage assay. These values are based on combining the data 
from Study 13401 for both low and high dose and data from PROTECT VIII study. 
Elimination is by catabolism. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality was evaluated between the 2 doses administered in the study (25 IU/kg and 60 
IU/kg).   
In the phase 1 study; using data based on chromogenic assay, there was no change in t1/2 upon 
multiple dosing as seen by the ratio of geometric LS mean and 90% confidence interval value of 1.02 
Assessment report

(0.927 – 1.13) and 1.05 (0.968 – 1.14) following 25 IU/kg dose of Jivi given twice weekly or 60 IU/kg 
dose given once weekly, respectively. The ratio of AUCnorm following multiple dose and single dose 
was 1.33 and for Cmax,norm was 1.29 following a 25 IU/kg dose given twice weekly suggesting that 
there was ~30% increase in exposure upon multiple dosing most likely due to higher frequency of 
administration (twice weekly) compared to the once weekly administration for the 60 IU/kg dose 
cohort. The ratio of AUCnorm following multiple dose and single dose was 1.09 and for Cmax,norm was 
1.07 following a 60 IU/kg dose given once a week suggesting that there was about 7-9% increase in 
exposure upon multiple dosing with once weekly regimen. Data based on one-stage assay showed a 
similar trend. Data based on the PEG-capture assay shows about 20% increase in AUCnorm and 
Cmax,norm for both dose cohorts following multiple dose as compared to single dose. 
In the PROTECT VIII study, of the 22 patients who participated in the initial PK study, a repeat PK 
evaluation was also performed in 16 subjects after 3-6 months of prophylaxis treatment. These 
patients received prophylactic doses ranging between 25 to 60 IU/kg 2x/week, q5d or q7d during this 
period. Dose used for PK evaluation was 60 IU/kg. 
Repeated PK measurements did not indicate any relevant changes in PK characteristics after long-term 
treatment.

PK Trials 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
• 
In vitro 
Damoctocog alfa pegol is a modified recombinant replacement protein of the naturally occurring 
coagulation factor FVIII that is catabolised. There are no known metabolising pathways and no known 
Cytochrome P450 (CYP) involvement.   
• 
In vivo 
Given the nature of the product, no PK interaction was expected with other drugs that are metabolised 
by CYP enzymes. No interaction studies were conducted with CYP-metabolized drugs potentially 
administered concomitantly.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No pharmacodynamics studies have been submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
Mechanism of action 
Standard treatment for patients with Haemophilia A is the replacement of the missing protein by 
intravenous infusion of either plasma-derived FVIII (pdFVIII) or recombinant FVIII (rFVIII). This 
increases the plasma concentrations of FVIII, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor 
deficiency and reversal of the bleeding tendencies. Damoctocog alfa pegol has the same mechanism of 
action as unmodified FVIII.  
Assessment report  
EMA/698571/2018  
Page 38/114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
The ability of Jivi to promote coagulation in rabbit, dog and human plasma has been investigated using 
an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPPT) assay in vitro and was shown to be dose-dependent. 
According to the guideline ICH S7A “Safety Pharmacological Studies for Human Pharmacologicals”, 
secondary pharmacological studies are defined as “studies on the mode of action and/or effects of a 
substance not related to its desired therapeutic target.” In the non-clinical studies of Jivi, no effects 
other than those induced by the primary action of Jivi were observed and no safety pharmacological 
parameters, for example, of renal and CNS function were investigated.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetic data is limited but demonstrates a longer half-life for the product versus Kogenate FS 
(17 versus 13 hours) and supports linearity in exposure between 25 IU/Kg and 60 IU/Kg. It is noted 
that the posology in the SmPC is exactly the same as that for Kogenate. Multiple dose data suggests 
minimal accumulation following once weekly dosing for 8 weeks or 6 months.   
A population model shows that the important covariates on exposure are lean body weight and VWF on 
clearance, and lean body weight on volume. Limited data for race does not suggest an impact on 
exposure.   
Since the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of FVIII as a major component in the coagulation cascade are 
well understood, the applicant’s justification for not conducting studies on PD in humans is acceptable. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the non-clinical documentation submitted was considered adequate.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
No formal dose ranging studies have been performed. The selection of treatment dose was derived 
empirically. The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy to achieve haemostasis was 
individualised according to the patient's needs (weight, severity of disorder of the haemostatic 
function, the site and extent/severity of the bleeding, and the FVIII level desired), patient 
characteristics and treatment responses.  
Dose recommendations for prophylaxis are based on the clinical efficacy demonstrated for the three 
treatment regimens, 2x/week, every 5, and every 7 days, with different dose ranges used during the 
clinical studies.   
In the clinical phase 2/3 studies, patients were assigned/randomized to the different regimens based 
on their clinical assessment, e.g. the number of spontaneous bleeds during the 10-week run-in phase. 
Dose adjustments were possible, if in the patient’s and investigator’s assessment the dose did not 
provide sufficient protection against bleeds. Although PK measures are useful laboratory tools to guide 
dosing, FVIII activity assays have a poor predictive value for individual bleed risks. The required FVIII 
level for protection is an individual parameter, which depends on patient characteristics, joint status as 
well as on life style and level of physical activity. Therefore, the effectiveness of the treatment is based 
on the events of bleeding rather than a certain FVIII activity level.   
Assessment report  
EMA/698571/2018  
Page 39/114 
 
 
 
 
 
During the study, the doses per injection were within the pre-specified ranges of each regimen for the 
majority of patients. All dose regimens, including the every 7-day dosing, achieved an excellent bleed 
control with median ABRs of approximately 1 to 2 bleeds/year for patients who stayed in their 
regimen. This outcome is comparable to other trials and is in the range of the expected bleed rate with 
prophylaxis treatment. The bleed rate could be maintained during the extension period for most 
patients. All patients in the every-5-day arm had a good bleed control, no patients switched to a higher 
regimen. For patients who were not sufficiently controlled with an every 7-day treatment and switched 
to a higher infusion frequency and those in the 2x/week arm who increased the dose/infusion, an 
improved outcome of ABR was achieved.

Methods 
Study Participants  
• 
Part A: Prophylaxis and on-demand use 
Overall, 149 subjects were enrolled and 134 subjects completed screening and were eligible for 
treatment in Part A. Fifteen subjects failed screening and the primary reasons for screening failure 
were screen failure, withdrawal by subject, and non-adherence to protocol visit windows.

Treatments 
• 
Part A 
As shown in Table 6 above and Figure 4 below, 134 subjects were treated in Part A of the study: 20 
subjects received on-demand treatment and 114 subjects received prophylaxis. A total of 18 (90.0%) 
subjects in the on-demand group and 108 (94.7%) in the prophylaxis group completed treatment in 
Part A. 
At the completion of Part A (LPLV date 25 DEC 2013), 126 subjects had completed treatment in Part A 
and 8 subjects had discontinued from the study. Of those subjects who discontinued, 5 withdrew 
consent, 2 were due to adverse events, and 1 was for “other” reasons involving non-adherence to the 
study protocol.

• 
Part B 
All 15 subjects (representing 16 subject IDs) received at least one dose of damoctocog alfa pegol in 
Part B (Table 7 above and Figure 5 below), and 14 subjects (representing 14 subject IDs) underwent a 
total of 17 major surgeries. Two subjects dropped out of Part B after having pre-surgical PK 
assessments but prior to surgery and one of these subjects was the subject that successfully re-
screened.

surgical procedures 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint: ABRs: The annualized number of total bleeds was defined as the sum of 
spontaneous bleeds and trauma bleeds during the main efficacy period (Week 10 to 36) for prophylaxis 
overall and by regimen annualized to one year.  Time and bleeds after regimen change (rescue bleeds) 
were not considered for the ABR of the respective treatment arm.  For on-demand patients, the ABR 
during Week 0 to 36 was used for annualisation. 
Main secondary endpoints: 
•

Sample size 
No formal statistical samples size estimates were performed. 
According to “Guideline on the clinical investigation of recombinant and human plasma-derived factor 
VIII products” EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009 rev. 1 at least 50 PTPs ≥ 12 years of age were to have 
been followed for at least 50 ED. Total sample size of the prophylaxis treatment group was picked to 
ensure that at least 50 subjects (including at least 12 subjects between 12 and < 18 years of age) 
enrolled in the 2x/week and every 5 days treatment groups combined would accumulate at least 50 
ED. Twenty subjects enrolled in the on-demand treatment group would primarily serve to provide 
assessment of the efficacy of damoctocog alfa pegol for the treatment of acute bleeding events, and in 
the assessment of safety/immunogenicity, and for comparison of bleeding rates. For the surgery 
group, 15 subjects ≥ 12 years of age were enrolled, of those 14 subjects received mayor surgery and 
Assessment report

in total 17 surgeries were performed in the main study. The guideline (Annex II) recommends 5 PTP ≥ 
12 years undergoing at least 1+ surgical procedures. 
Randomisation 
Part A 
The design of the study is shown in Figure 3. Two main arms were included in this study: On demand 
and Prophylaxis. The study was partially randomized to 5 groups: On-demand (no randomization), 
2x/week failed (no randomization), 2x/week forced (no randomization but qualified for randomization 
to longer intervals between administration), Every 5 days (randomization) and Every 7 days 
(randomization).  
Figure 3: Part A Design 
Part B 
Part B is an open label, non-controlled, single-arm trial for subjects who require major surgery. This 
trial is open to all subjects participating in Part A, or optional extension, and to individuals with severe 
haemophilia A not otherwise enrolled in this clinical study who meet the same inclusion and exclusion 
criteria as required in Part A. Subjects undergoing major surgery will receive damoctocog alfa pegol for 
pre-surgical PK measurements followed by treatment with the study drug during their hospital stay and 
up to the time of discharge, for a period not exceeding a total of 3 weeks. At least 10 subjects who 
need major surgery will be enrolled in this part of the study. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was un-blinded. 
Statistical methods 
All variables have been summarised with descriptive statistics. The number of data available, missing 
data, mean, standard deviation, minimum, quartiles, median, and maximum will be calculated for 
metric data. Frequency tables were to be generated for categorical data. 
Efficacy and safety data were to be collected from all subjects to whom study medication was 
dispensed. The safety population included all subjects enrolled into the study who received at least 1 
Assessment report  
EMA/698571/2018  
Page 44/114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
dose of study medication. The intent-to-treat (ITT) population included all safety subjects who have 
infusion/bleeding data from the EPD and any on-demand subjects who did not have any bleeds and 
thus have no infusion/bleeding data in the EPD. The ITT population will be used for the primary efficacy 
analysis. 
Missing data 
Missing dates for infusion or bleeds: In this case the date/time from the associated bleed or infusion 
will be imputed. 
Missing items in patient reported outcomes questionnaires: In general, when calculating a subscale 
score, if less than 50% of the subscale items are missing, then the subscale score can be imputed by 
the mean score of the answered items times the number of items in that subscale. If 50% or more of 
the items are missing, then no imputation should be done. 
Results 
Efficacy data will be summarised for all subjects in the intent-to-treat (ITT Part A) population, and all 
subjects in the ITT Part B population. The primary efficacy variable for Part A will be the annualized 
number of total bleeds (sum of spontaneous bleeds and trauma bleeds) in Weeks 10-36 on assigned 
dosing frequency. 
Efficacy analysis – Part A 
The primary efficacy variable will be the annualized number of total bleeds (sum of spontaneous bleeds 
and trauma bleeds). Also summarized will be joint bleeds, spontaneous bleeds, and trauma bleeds. 
Other variables summarized will be the number of treatments required to stop bleeding and the 
subjects’ assessment of the response to treatment of all bleeds (excellent, good, moderate, or poor).   
Efficacy Analysis – Part B 
For subjects undergoing major surgery, FVIII levels from the day prior to surgery through the post-
operative period will be listed. Study drug or other medications used to provide haemostasis, and blood 
product infusions will be listed, as well as the blood loss during surgery and the assessment of 
haemostasis during the perioperative period by both the surgeon and the investigator. 
For subjects who participate in both Part A and Part B, when calculating the annualized number of 
bleeds in Part A, in order to provide a more accurate representation of the bleeding rate, Part B time 
period is carved out from Part A. The Part B time period is defined to start at the hospital admission. 
The end of the Part B is defined as the hospital discharge or 3 weeks from surgery date and time, 
whichever comes first.

At the completion of Part A (LPLV date 25 DEC 2013), 126 subjects had completed treatment in Part A 
and 8 subjects had discontinued from the study. Of those subjects who discontinued, 5 withdrew 
consent, 2 were due to adverse events, and 1 was for “other” reasons involving non-adherence to the 
study protocol. 
A summary of subjects who discontinued study treatment during Part A and their reason for 
discontinuation is provided in Table 8. 
Table 8: Subjects who prematurely discontinued from study – (Part A safety population) 
Part B 
A total of 15 distinct subjects were screened; 1 subject entered Part B, performed pre-surgery PK, 
became a drop-out, and was re-screened successfully at a later stage, leading to a total of 16 different 
subject IDs. No screening failures occurred in Part B. Five subjects also participated in Part A. 
Conduct of the study 
Part A 
Part A of the multinational PROTECT VIII study was conducted at 58 centers that enrolled subjects 
across 19 countries. Each center enrolled at least 1 subject who was treated except for 1 site in South 
Korea that enrolled a subject who was not treated due to screening failure. The subjects who received 
treatment in Part A were from the following participating countries: Austria, Belgium, Canada, 
Colombia, Germany, Denmark, France, United Kingdom, Israel, Italy, Japan, South Korea, 
Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Singapore, Turkey, Taiwan and the United States. 
Overall, 149 subjects were enrolled and 134 subjects completed screening and were eligible for 
treatment in Part A. Fifteen subjects failed screening and the primary reasons for screening failure 
were screen failure, withdrawal by subject, and non-adherence to protocol visit windows. 
A total of 15 subjects who received on-demand therapy and 65 subjects who received prophylactic 
therapy had minor protocol deviations. A total of 12 Part A subjects had 21 important deviations. 
According to the ICH E3 guidelines an important deviation is one “that may significantly affect a 
subject’s safety, or well-being”. The important deviations noted during the course of this study include 
administration of doses higher than 6000 IU per infusion and use of expired study medication. 
Although these were important protocol deviations which were followed very closely and CAPAs were 
initiated to avoid their reoccurrence, these deviations were graded as “minor” to indicate that data of 
Assessment report  
EMA/698571/2018  
Page 47/114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
these subjects were nevertheless used for the analysis of the ITT population. However, no safety 
concerns were associated with these deviations. 
There were no major protocol deviations during the study. Although the tables and listings indicate 
that two subjects in the prophylaxis group had major protocol deviations, these subjects did not 
deviate from the protocol. Both subjects discontinued after a single dose of study drug and, although it 
was recognized that these were not deviations from the protocol, they were listed as major deviations 
in order to exclude these subjects from the ITT population. No safety concerns were associated with 
these deviations. 
All eligible subjects (N=134) in Part A (on-demand [n=20]; prophylaxis [n=114], Table 6) received at 
least 1 dose of treatment with study drug as specified in the protocol and were included in the Safety 
population. 
Treatment compliance 
For each subject that received prophylaxis treatment, compliance with the prescribed dose and 
regimen (frequency of dosing) of study drug was evaluated based on CRF and EPD data. All subjects 
had dosing frequency, individual doses, and total dose received within 75% to 125% of what was 
expected. 
Part B 
The subjects participating in Part B were from the following countries: Austria , France , United 
Kingdom , Israel , Italy , Netherlands, Romania, Turkey , Taiwan, and the United States. One site in 
Romania and one site in Italy participated in Part B only. All 15 subjects in main study (representing 16 
subject IDs) received at least one dose of damoctocog alfa pegol in Part B (Table 7), and 14 subjects 
(representing 14 subject IDs) underwent a total of 17 major surgeries. Two subjects dropped out of 
Part B after having pre-surgical PK assessments but prior to surgery and one of these subjects was the 
subject that successfully re-screened. 
In 3 patients of Part A extension 3 additional major surgeries were performed during the Part B 
extension resulting in a total of 20 major surgeries in 17 Subjects. 
Two subjects received one dose of pre-surgery study drug and then dropped out of the study before 
any surgical data were recorded. These subjects are still included in the safety population. 
Treatment compliance 
Subjects in Part B were to receive damoctocog alfa pegol only during pre-surgery PK, their peri-
surgical stay in the hospital, and up to 3 weeks post-operatively. All infusions were to be documented 
in the subject’s medical chart and in the CRF. 
Baseline data 
Part A 
Demographics 
A total of 134 subjects received treatment in Part A at 57 centers in 19 countries. At least 50 subjects 
(including at least 12 subjects between the ages of 12 and < 18) were followed for at least 50 ED 
during the main and extension phases of the study (Table 9). One of the adolescent subjects 
Assessment report  
EMA/698571/2018

completed the 50 ED after he began the extension phase of Part A main study. A summary of 
demographic information for all Part A subjects is shown in Table 9. 
Table 9: Demographics – (Part A safety population) 
Abbreviations: N=number of subjects; SD+ standard deviation 
Baseline disease characteristics 
A summary of disease characteristics related to haemophilia by treatment regimen is provided for the 
Part A Safety population in Table 10. Severe Haemophilia A was confirmed for all subjects at 
screening. 
Table 10: Disease characteristics – (Part A safety population) 
Gilbert Score 
In addition to other disease characteristics, the Gilbert Score was evaluated at screening for subjects 
treated in Part A and was used to identify predictors of bleeding and likelihood of randomization. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/698571/2018  
Page 49/114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
clinical joint evaluation consists of the assessment of the pain score, the bleeding score and the 
physical examination of the following joints: ankles, knees and elbows. The total score has a possible 
range between 0 and 100 points, where 0 points reflect normal, unaffected joints. The possible range 
of the total score excluding pain and bleeding scores is 0 to 68 points. 
The mean (±SD) total Gilbert Score at screening was 21.3 ± 13.5 points and ranged between 0 and 76 
points for subjects in Part A. The mean Gilbert Score excluding pain and bleeding scores (ie, the 
physical examination score) was 14.2 ± 9.7 points and ranged between 0 and 47 points. 
Medical and surgical history 
Medical history data are presented by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) for SOCs and 
PTs occurring at ≥ 10% frequency and other important events by PT in Table 11.

Prior Factor VIII therapy 
Per protocol, all subjects had received prior therapy for FVIII deficiency for at least 150 ED prior to 
study entry. For subjects who received prophylaxis treatment in Part A, most (91 subjects) were on a 
prior prophylactic treatment regimen. 
Concomitant medications 
A total of 113 (84.3%) subjects, 19 (95.0%) in the on-demand treatment arm and 94 (82.5%) 
subjects in the prophylaxis treatment arm, received at least 1 concomitant medication during Part A of 
the study. The concomitant medication CRF page collected information on previous FVIII products; 
therefore 100% of subjects had used at least one medication prior to the start of study drug. 
Concomitant medications recorded were consistent with those expected for this subject population with 
severe Haemophilia A.

Part B 
Demographics 
Demographic characteristics for subjects in Part B are summarized in Table 12. 
Table 12: Demographics – (Part B safety population) 
Abbreviations: N=number of subjects; SD= standard deviation 
Baseline disease characteristics 
Severe haemophilia A was confirmed for all subjects at screening. A familial history of haemophilia was 
documented for 8 (50.0%) subjects and 1 (6.3%) subject had a familial history of the inhibitor for 
FVIII. One (6.3%) subject had a reported history of having a FVIII inhibitor. Subjects with a maximum 
historical titer of 1.0 BU on a single measurement but with at least 3 subsequent successive negative 
results (< 0.6 BU) thereafter were eligible for Part B of the study. 
Medical and surgical history 
Medical history data are presented by SOC for those events occurring at ≥50% frequency and by PT if 
individual events occurred at ≥50% frequency in Table 13.

Prior Factor VIII therapy 
Assessment report  
EMA/698571/2018  
Page 52/114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Per protocol, all subjects had received prior therapy for FVIII deficiency for at least 150 ED prior to 
study entry. 
Concomitant medications 
There were 15 (93.8%) subjects who received at least 1 concomitant medication during Part B of this 
study. The medications also include the 2 subjects who received one dose of study drug and then 
dropped out. 
The concomitant medication CRF page collected information on previous FVIII products; therefore 
100% of subjects had used at least one medication prior to the start of study drug. Concomitant 
medications recorded were consistent with those expected for this subject population with severe 
Haemophilia A and major surgery. 
Numbers analysed 
Part A 
The LPLV for Part A occurred on 25 DEC 2013, the date that the last subject completed Part A of the 
study. At this date, 93 subjects had accumulated at least 50 ED. 
Of the 134 subjects successfully screened during Part A of the study, 20 received on-demand 
treatment and 114 received prophylaxis treatment. A total of 132 subjects were included in the 
primary efficacy summaries based on the ITT population. Two subjects discontinued after a single dose 
of study drug and, although these subjects were included in the safety evaluation, they were excluded 
from the ITT population because no efficacy data for these subjects were available for evaluation. 
Part B 
All subjects who received study drug are included in the Safety population and all subjects who 
underwent major surgery are included in the ITT population. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Prophylactic treatment in subjects ≥12 years 
During the main study period subjects were assigned to prophylaxis 2x/week (n=24), or randomized to 
every 5 days (n=43) or every 7 days (n=43) or received on-demand treatment (n=20) with Jivi. 
Ninety nine of 110 patients (90%) remained on the assigned regimen. Eleven patients in the every 
7days arm increased frequency. The median dose for all prophylaxis regimens was 46.9 
IU/kg/injection. The median (Q1; Q3) ABR during prophylaxis was 2.09 (0.0; 6.1) for all bleeds and 
0.0 (0;0 4.2) for spontaneous bleeds as compared to 23.4 (18; 37) total bleeds in the on-demand 
group. Forty-two out of 110 in the prophylaxis arms (38.2%) experienced no bleeding episode. 
During the extension study, 24 patients were treated 2x/week, 37 patients every 5-days, 29 patients 
every 7 days and 17 patients changed treatment regimen. The median dose for prophylaxis was 47.7 
IU/kg. The overall median (Q1; Q3) total ABR was 1.17 (0.0; 4.3) and 0.6 (0.0: 3.2) for spontaneous 
bleeds in the combined prophylaxis groups and total ABR was 33.0 in the on-demand group. 
Of note, ABR is not comparable between different factor concentrates and between different clinical 
studies. 
Treatment of bleeding 
Assessment report  
EMA/698571/2018  
Page 53/114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Of the 702 bleeding events treated with Jivi during the main study, 636 (90.6%) were treated with 1 
or 2 injections, thereof 81.1% with 1 injection. The median (range) dose per injection was 31.7 IU/kg 
(14; 62). During the extension study, 942 bleeds were treated with Jivi and 92.3% were controlled 
with 1 or 2 injections, thereof 83% with 1 injection. The median (range) dose was 37.3 (18; 66) 
IU/kg/injection. 
Perioperative Management 
Combining part B of the main study and the extension study, a total of 20 major surgical procedures 
were performed and assessed in 17 patients. The median total dose for major surgeries was 219 IU/kg 
(range: 50-1500 IU/kg, including postoperative period up to 3 weeks). Perioperative haemostatic 
efficacy was rated as good or excellent during all major surgeries. 
Additional 34 minor surgeries were performed in 19 patients. Haemostasis was assessed as good or 
excellent in all available cases.

Ancillary analyses 
Part A 
Other efficacy variables referring to bleeds 
None of the subjects in the on-demand group remained bleed free. A total of 42 subjects (38.2%) in 
the prophylaxis arms experienced no bleeds after randomization. 
Other efficacy variables included spontaneous bleeds, trauma bleeds, and joint bleeds. These data 
were summarized in  
Table 14 by bleed type and treatment group.

Table 14: Summary of bleeds by type and treatment group (Part A ITT population) 
Table 15 displays the summary of bleeds in the individual prophylaxis treatment groups, excluding 
rescue bleeds, during Weeks 10-36. 
Table 15: Summary of bleeds by type and prophylaxis treatment group during Weeks 10-36, 
excluding rescue bleeds – (Part A ITT population) 
The mean annualized number of joint bleeds was highest in 2x/week failed group (5.23 ± 4.76 
bleeds/year). 
Prophylactic treatment revealed a similar positive reduction of bleeds regardless of the type of bleed. 
The median total number of total bleeds per year was 23.42 for the on-demand treatment group and 
2.82 for the prophylaxis treatment groups combined – including the run-in period. The median number 
of total bleeds in subjects who received prophylaxis treatment was 88% lower than in subjects who 
received on-demand treatment. 
Table 16 summarizes the time since the previous infusion for subjects in the prophylaxis arm, during 
Weeks 10-36, excluding rescue bleeds.

Table 16: Summary of time to bleed since previous infusion in prophylaxis arm, Weeks 10-
36, excluding rescue bleeds – (Part A ITT population) 
Subjects with less frequent infusions had a longer duration of protection with subjects in the every 7 
day treatment group having the longest mean duration between previous infusions and occurrence of a 
bleed at 4.72 (±1.5) days. Similarly, subjects in the every 5 and every 7 day treatment groups had 
longer periods between infusions as a result of their randomization (Table 16). 
Haemostatic control during minor surgeries 
A total of 17 minor surgeries performed in 10 subjects were reported during Part A of the study. Eleven 
of these surgeries were dental extractions or other dental procedures. The remaining 6 surgeries 
included a repeat vasectomy, a colonoscopy, 2 procedures related to treatment of a cataract, incision 
and draining of an abscess, and a frenulum excision. The pre-surgery dose of damoctocog alfa pegol 
ranged from 1000 to 3000 IU. The maximum blood loss during surgery was 100 mL during the draining 
of an abscess. No subjects required blood transfusions. 
The adequacy of haemostasis during surgery was assessed as either “good” or “excellent” in all cases 
(for 1 surgery, the assessment was missing). A summary of the main characteristics of minor surgeries 
is given in Table 17.

Page 56/114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Samples for damoctocog alfa pegol trough and recovery levels were collected in all subjects in Part A. 
Plasma concentrations of Factor VIII were measured using a validated clotting assay based on the 
activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) (“one-stage assay”) and a validated enzymatic Factor VIII 
activity assay (“chromogenic assay”). The mean (range) of overall recovery value was 2.674 kg/dL 
(1.32 – 4.48) using the chromogenic assay and 2.933 kg/dL (range: 1.23-4.90) using the one-stage 
assay. The mean overall recovery for prophylaxis group inclusive of data from visits 2, 3, 4, 6 and end 
of treatment was 2.681 kg/dL (1.32-5.43) using the chromogenic assay and 2.922 kg/dL (1.38-5.65) 
using the one stage assay. In general the Factor VIII recovery values were similar across visits and 
across treatment groups regardless of the assay.

Annualized bleeding 
The annualized number of total bleeds was defined as 
rate (ABR)  
the sum of spontaneous bleeds and trauma bleeds 
during the main efficacy period (Week 10 to 36) for 
prophylaxis overall and by regimen annualized to one 
year.  Time and bleeds after regimen change (rescue 
bleeds) were not considered for the ABR of the 
respective treatment arm.  For on-demand patients, 
the ABR during Week 0 to 36 was used for 
annualization.

PROTECT Kids: A multi-centre, phase III, non-controlled, open-label trial to 
evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of damoctocog alfa 
pegol for prophylaxis and treatment of bleeding in previously treated 
children (age <12 years) with severe haemophilia A 
Study participants  
A total of 65 subjects were screened for enrollment in the main study. Three subjects initially failed 
screening but were successfully re-screened and enrolled in the main study (Error! Reference source 
not found.) resulting in 68 subject patient identification (PID) numbers. Five subjects were not eligible 
and 2 subjects had logistical difficulties, resulting in 61 PTPs (32 in the age group 0 to <6 years and 29 
in the age group 6 to <12 years) that actually participated in the main study and comprised the Safety 
set. One subject was excluded from the ITT population (N=60) after receiving a single dose due to lack 
of efficacy data. Eight subjects were early dropouts due to adverse events (N=7) or withdrawal of 
Assessment report

consent due to perceived LoE (N=1). These subjects were included in the safety and ITT populations 
but excluded in the analyses of ABR. 
Inclusion criteria: 
Subjects eligible for inclusion into the study had to meet all of the following inclusion criteria: 
1. Male, age <12 years to be enrolled in 2 subgroups: 
• 
• 
age 6 to <12 years 
age <6 years 
2. Severe haemophilia A defined as <1% Factor VIII concentration (FVIII:C) by measurement at the 
time of screening or from reliable prior documentation (e.g., measurement in other clinical trials, 
results from approved clinical laboratory, or diagnostic genetic testing) 
3. >50 ED with any FVIII concentrate(s) (plasma derived or recombinant) 
4. Willingness and ability of subjects and/or parents to complete training in the use of the EPD and to 
document infusions during the study 
5. Written informed consent by parent/legal representative. Assent was to be sought from subjects, if 
appropriate 
Exclusion criteria: 
Subjects who met any of the following criteria at the Screening (Visit 1) or Baseline (Visit 2) visits were 
to be excluded from participating in the study: 
1. Current evidence of inhibitor to FVIII measured using the Nijmegen modified Bethesda assay (>0.6 
Bethesda units [BU]/mL) at the time of screening (central laboratory). Subjects should not have 
received FVIII within 72 h prior to the collection of screening samples and should have had FVIII 
administered within the prior 2-3 weeks. 
2. History or presence of FVIII inhibitors. Inhibitor to FVIII was defined as a titer >0.6 BU/mL or 
clinical history suggestive of inhibitor requiring modification of treatment. (Subjects with a maximum 
historical titer of <1.0 BU on no more than 1 occasion with the classical Bethesda assay but at least 3 
subsequent negative results [<0.6 BU] were eligible.) 
3. Any other inherited or acquired bleeding disorder in addition to haemophilia A 
4. Platelet count < 100,000/mm3 
5. Creatinine > 2x upper limit of normal (ULN) 
6. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 5x ULN 
7. Known hypersensitivity to the drug substance, or any of its components (eg, mouse or hamster 
protein) 
8. The subject was currently participating in another investigational drug study, or had participated in 
a clinical study involving an investigational drug within 30 days of study entry. Subjects who were 
currently participating in an investigational study in which they were treated with a currently marketed 
FVIII concentrate were not excluded. Subjects currently treated with damoctocog alfa pegol may have 
continued treatment with the product up to the start of Visit 1. 
Assessment report  
EMA/698571/2018  
Page 63/114 
 
 
 
 
 
9. Any individual who was receiving chemotherapy, immune modulatory drugs other than anti-
retroviral chemotherapy, or chronic use of oral or intravenous (IV) corticosteroids (> 14 days) within 
the last 3 months. 
10. The subject was identified by the investigator as being unable or unwilling to perform study 
procedures. 
11. Previous assignment to treatment during this study. 
Subjects were not to be enrolled with clinical history suggestive of an inhibitor. Clinical history 
suggestive of an inhibitor may have included known history of reduced recovery or shortened half-
lives, or the need to modify treatment on the basis of a positive inhibitor test. 
Treatments 
Across both age groups, 53 of these subjects completed at least 50 ED with damoctocog alfa pegol 
during the main study (including 25 subjects <6 years of age and 28 subjects between the ages of 6 
and <12) (Table 19, see Results Efficacy PROTECT Kids). 
At the completion of the main study, 53 subjects had completed treatment and 8 subjects had 
discontinued from the study. Of those subjects who discontinued, 1 parent withdrew consent, and 7 
were discontinued due to AEs. In the case of withdrawal of consent, there was a perceived loss of 
efficacy (LoE) with no AEs reported.  
At the start of the study, 18 subjects began treatment at 2x/week, 27 subjects at every 5 days, and 15 
subjects at every 7 days across both age groups for the ITT population (Table 21, see Results Efficacy 
PROTECT Kids). Fifty-one of 60 subjects (85%) in the ITT population remained at their initial dose 
frequency at the end of the study. Eight subjects, all in the every 7 day treatment group, increased 
their dose frequency. These subjects increased their dose frequency to either every 5 days (6 subjects) 
or to 2x/week treatment (2 subjects). One of the 27 subjects from the every 5 days group decreased 
frequency to every 7 days (Table 21). At the end of the main study, 20 subjects were in the 2x/week 
regimen, 32 in the every 5 days regimen, and 8 in the every 7 days regimen. For the 9 subjects (15%) 
who changed their dose frequency at least once during the main study, bleeding data were assessed in 
the efficacy evaluation under the dosing group labeled “variable frequency”. 
During the study, all subjects were to receive treatment with damoctocog alfa pegol only for 
prophylaxis and treatment of bleeds. The starting dosing regimen for each individual subject was to be 
selected by the investigator (with input from the subject and/or parents as appropriate), so that 
treatment were to begin with prophylaxis administered either twice per week (25 IU/kg), every 5 days 
(45 IU/kg), or every 7 days (60 IU/kg). Investigators were asked to begin treatment with the least 
frequent infusion schedule they believe is appropriate for treatment of the subject. Once a dosing 
regimen was chosen, the doses and dose frequency could be adjusted at the discretion of the treating 
physician to meet the subject’s clinical needs according to the recommendations stated in the protocol. 
Objectives 
The objective of PROTECT Kids was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of damoctocog alfa pegol in 
previously treated paediatric subjects <12 years with severe Haemophilia A administered as 
prophylaxis in an everyday setting.

investigations of FVIII products. Age groups are in accordance with the International Conference on 
Harmonization (ICH) guidelines for studies in pediatric populations and sample sizes have been 
Assessment report  
EMA/698571/2018

confirmed in consultation with the European Medicines Agency Pediatric Committee [EMA/PDCO] on 
submission of the Pediatric Investigation Plan. 
Total sample size comprised at least 50 subjects in 2 age group subgroups: 
•  Subgroup 1 (n=25): age 6 to <12 years 
•  Subgroup 2 (n=25): <6 years 
Randomisation 
No randomization was performed.  
Blinding (masking) 
Not applicable. This was an open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
The goal of the damoctocog alfa pegol program is to develop a longer-acting FVIII for prophylaxis that 
retains the ability to be used for treatment of acute bleeding events. To support these efforts, the 
primary outcomes analyzed for this study will be  
• 
• 
• 
Efficacy of damoctocog alfa pegol as measured by the annualized number of all bleeds (overall, 
joint, trauma, and spontaneous) 
Pharmacokinetics parameters for damoctocog alfa pegol (Cmax, half-life, area under the curve, 
MRT, Vss and clearance) 
Efficacy of damoctocog alfa pegol as measured by subject/parent or physician assessment of 
response to acute bleeding events by the subject/parent (or treating physician if subject 
hospitalized) 
Statistical analyses were descriptive in nature. All data were listed and summary tables were provided. 
Available and missing data, mean, standard deviation, and other summary statistics were calculated 
for continuous data. Frequency tables were generated for categorical data. Demographic, efficacy and 
safety subgroup analyses were provided for each of the age groups included in the study. 
Missing data 
Missing dates for infusion or bleeds: In this case the date/time from the associated bleed or infusion 
will be imputed. 
Missing item in patient reported outcomes questionnaires: In generally , when calculating a subscale 
score, if less than 50% of the subscale items are missing, then the subscale score can be imputed by 
the mean score of the answered items times the number of items in that subscale. If 50% or more of 
the items are missing, then no imputation should be done. 
Intent-to-treat analysis set (ITT main part) 
Efficacy data were collected from all patients who were dispensed study medication.  The ITT 
population included all safety patients, i.e., patients enrolled into the study who received at least 1 
dose of study medication, and who had infusion/bleeding data from the EPD. 
A total of 61 patients (0 to < 6 years: 32 patients; 6 to < 12 years: 29 patients) received at least 1 
dose of study drug and were included in the safety population. One patient discontinued after a single 
Assessment report  
EMA/698571/2018

dose of study drug and was excluded from the ITT population because no efficacy data for this patient 
were available. The efficacy analysis of the ABR excluded 8 patients who dropped-out due to AEs (7 
patients) or withdrawal of consent (1 patient).  These patients received study drug for only 1 to 9 EDs. 
An annualisation of the bleeding rate is not considered adequate for patients with such a short 
exposure time. Consequently, 53 patients (defined as completers) with at least 50 EDs during the main 
study (< 6 years: 25 patients; 6 to < 12 years: 28 patients) were included in the efficacy analyses of 
PTPs < 12 years of age.

Recruitment 
At LPLV on 19 MAR 2015, the requirement of at least 50 subjects having completed 50 ED had been 
fulfilled. Although a major surgery option was added with Amendment 2, no subject had major surgery 
during the main study. 
A total of 65 subjects were screened for enrollment in the main study. Three subjects initially failed 
screening but were successfully re-screened and enrolled in the main study resulting in 68 subject 
patient identification (PID) numbers. Five subjects were not eligible and 2 subjects had logistical 
difficulties, resulting in 61 PTPs (32 in the age group 0 to <6 years and 29 in the age group 6 to <12 
years) that actually participated in the main study and comprised the Safety set. One subject was 
excluded from the ITT population (N=60). 
Across both age groups, 53 of these subjects completed at least 50 ED with damoctocog alfa pegol 
during the main study (including 25 subjects <6 years of age and 28 subjects between the ages of 6 
and <12). 
Conduct of the study 
PROTECT Kids was conducted at 31 centers that enrolled subjects across 13 countries. Each center 
enrolled at least 1 subject who signed informed consent. The subjects who enrolled in the main study 
were from the following participating countries: Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, United 
Kingdom, Israel, Italy, Lithuania, Netherlands, Poland, Romania, and the United States. 
At the completion of the main study, 53 subjects had completed treatment and 8 subjects had 
discontinued from the study. Of those subjects who discontinued, 1 parent withdrew consent, and 7 
were discontinued due to AEs. In the case of withdrawal of consent, there was a perceived loss of 
efficacy (LoE) with no AEs reported..

Assessment report  
EMA/698571/2018

At the start of the study, 18 subjects began treatment at 2x/week, 27 subjects at every 5 days, and 15 
subjects at every 7 days across both age groups for the ITT population (Table 21). Fifty-one of 60 
subjects (85%) in the ITT population remained at their initial dose frequency at the end of the study. 
Eight subjects, all in the every 7 day treatment group, increased their dose frequency. These subjects 
increased their dose frequency to either every 5 days (6 subjects) or to 2x/week treatment (2 
subjects). One of the 27 subjects from the every 5 days group decreased frequency to every 7 days 
(Table 21). At the end of the main study, 20 subjects were in the 2x/week regimen, 32 in the every 5 
days regimen, and 8 in the every 7 days regimen. For the 9 subjects (15%) who changed their dose 
frequency at least once during the main study, bleeding data were assessed in the efficacy evaluation 
under the dosing group labelled “variable frequency”. 
Table 21: Number of subjects at the start and end of the main study period by treatment 
arm (ITT set) - amended 
A total of 49 of the 68 enrolled subjects in the main study had minor protocol deviations, including the 
8 subjects who prematurely discontinued the study. Although it is indicated that one subject in the 6 to 
<12 years old group had a major protocol deviation, this subject did not deviate from the protocol. 
This subject signed informed consent and took one infusion of damoctocog alfa pegol at Visit 2 
(Baseline), but did not take any further infusions. The subject subsequently discontinued the study due 
to an AE and was listed as a major protocol deviation in order to exclude him from the ITT set because 
no efficacy data for this subject were available for evaluation. 
Treatment compliance 
For each subject that received prophylaxis treatment, compliance with the prescribed dose and 
regimen (frequency of dosing) of study drug was evaluated based on CRF and EPD data. All reasonable 
attempts were made to ensure that subjects complied with their designated prophylaxis infusion 
schedule with few interruptions. However, in situations when problems related to difficult venous 
access, or travel to locations where appropriate support for infusions was not available, a brief hiatus 
in the treatment schedule was allowed.

One subject in the younger age group had a history of inhibitor titre measurement (0.5 BU). The 
investigator reported this as history of inhibitor, but it was less than the threshold of <0.6 BU defined 
in the study protocol and the subject satisfied all inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
Genetic analysis results were collected for all 61 subjects as part of the medical history and showed 
that the mutations present in the population were representative of subjects with severe haemophilia 
A. 
The number of bleeds in the previous year ranged from 0 to 100 (median: 3.0) across both age 
groups. The annualized bleeding rate prior to enrolment in the younger age group was lower than in

joint bleeds (0.0 vs. 2.0 joint bleeds). 
Medical and surgical history 
Medical history data are presented by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) for SOCs and 
PTs occurring at ≥10% frequency by PT in Table 24.

Central venous access was reported in the medical history as being used for study drug administration 
in 8 subjects of the younger age group and in 3 subjects of the older group. 
Prior FVIII therapy 
Per protocol, all subjects had received prior therapy for FVIII deficiency for at least 50 ED prior to 
study entry. For subjects who received treatment in the main study, most subjects (91.8%) were on a 
prior prophylactic treatment regimen (Table 23). 
Concomitant medications 
A total of 50 (82.0%) subjects, 29 (90.6%) in the <6 years old group and 21 (72.4%) in the 6 to <12 
years old group, received at least 1 concomitant medication during the main study. The concomitant 
medication eCRF page collected information on previous FVIII products; therefore 100% of subjects 
had used at least one medication prior to the start of study drug. 
Concomitant medications that were newly started during the study were reported in 11 (18.0%) 
subjects; 7 (21.9%) subjects in the <6 years old group and 4 (13.8%) subjects in the 6 to <12 years 
old group. 
Concomitant medications recorded were consistent with those expected for this subject population with 
severe haemophilia A. 
Numbers analysed 
In the main study, 61 subjects received at least 1 dose of treatment with study drug as specified in the 
protocol and were included in the Safety population. One subject discontinued after a single dose of 
study drug and, although this subject was included in the safety evaluation, he was excluded from the 
ITT population because no efficacy data for this subject were available for evaluation. A total of 34 
subjects (16 in the <6 years old group and 18 in the 6 to <12 years old group) had valid 
measurements for PK evaluations. 
The LPLV for the main study occurred on 19 MAR 2015; the date that the last subject completed the 
main study. As of this date, 53 subjects had completed the study requirement of having accumulated 
at least 50 ED. 
Of the 61 subjects successfully screened for the study, 32 subjects in the <6 years old group and 29 
subjects in the 6 to <12 years old group received treatment during the main study (Table 23). A total 
of 60 subjects were included in the primary efficacy summaries based on the ITT population.

Table 26. 
Table 25: Summary of bleeds (ITT set) 
The 60 subjects included in the ITT set had a total of 140 bleeds. Of these, 88 (63%) were traumatic 
bleeds and 52 (37%) were spontaneous bleeds ( 
Table 27). Damoctocog alfa pegol was effective for prevention of bleeding in previously treated 
children under the age of 12 years once a stable dose regimen was achieved. All subjects in the study 
experienced a median of 2 bleeds (range 0-11) for both age groups combined (

Table 25) over a median time of 245 days on study (range 15-448 days) corresponding to a median 
ABR of 2.87 (interquartile range [IQR]: 0.53-6.79). The median ABR across both age groups was very 
similar (2.68 vs. 2.92). 
Overall, 15 (25%) subjects who received prophylaxis treatment across all regimens had no bleeding. 
The proportion of subjects with no bleeds was 21.9% for subjects <6 years old and 28.6% for subjects 
6 to <12 years old ( 
Table 25). Of the 18 subjects in the 2x/week treatment arm, 8 (44%) had 0 bleeds.

The overall ABR was strongly influenced by those subjects who changed their dose frequency at least 
once during the main study. Subjects in this “variable frequency” group had an overall median ABR of 
5.65 (IQR: 2.47-7.10) in subjects <6 years (N=6) and 10.62 (IQR: 1.39-11.01) in the 6 to <12 years 
age group (N=3); whereas subjects who remained on their initial dose frequency had significantly 
lower median ABRs (1.78 in the 2x/week group, 3.85 in the every 5 days group, and 1.37 in the every 
7 days group for the <6 years old group and 0.99, 3.03, and 2.19 for the 6 to <12 years old group, 
respectively) ( 
Table 26). This subgroup of 9 subjects (15% of total population) accounted for 40 (29%) of the total 
140 bleeds (

Other efficacy variables included spontaneous bleeds, trauma bleeds, and joint bleeds.

that were into target joints.

The overall median ABR was 0 for both spontaneous bleeds and joint bleeds and was 1.35 for trauma 
bleeds. At the start of the study, 18 subjects began treatment at 2x/week, 27 subjects at every 5 
days, and 15 subjects at every 7 days (Table 21). Changes to both dose (IU/kg) and dose frequency 
(2x/week, every 5 days, every 7 days) were recorded and subjects were evaluated for efficacy by both 
age and treatment frequency. Table 28 displays the number of subjects who changed prophylaxis 
dosage but did not switch dose frequency. 
Table 28: Number of subjects who changed prophylaxis dosage but did not switch arm (ITT 
set) 
The majority of subjects (85%) did not change their treatment frequency during of the main study 
(Table 28). Of the subjects who changed dose and/or frequency, 17 subjects (33%) increased their 
dose at least one time during treatment, while one subject decreased his dose. The dose was increased 
in 6 subjects dosed 2x/week, and 11 subjects dosed every 5 days (Table 29). Ten out of these 17 
subjects (59%) increased their dose in response to increased bleeding frequency and 9 of them 
experienced improvement in their ABR after dose increase. One investigator gave “insufficient 
prophylactic dose” as a reason for a dosage change and this subject dropped out of the study shortly 
after the change. The remaining subjects changed dose due to other reasons such as increase in body 
weight and in response to available vial sizes. 
Subjects in the every 7 days treatment group received a fixed dose of 60 IU/kg/infusion. If bleeding 
control was considered inadequate, these subjects were to change their infusion frequency to every 5 
days or 2x/week treatment. A listing of subjects who changed prophylaxis dose but did not change 
treatment arm is shown in Table 29. A listing of subjects in the ITT set who switched treatment arm is 
shown in Table 30.

Table 30: Subjects who switched dose frequency (ITT set) 
A total of 9 subjects changed dose frequency at least one time during the treatment period (Table 30). 
Eight of the 15 subjects who started treatment every 7 days increased their dose frequency; 7 of them 
in response to bleeds. All subjects who increased their dose frequency had improvement in their ABR 
(Table 30). The median number of bleeds experienced before change in frequency was 2 (range: 0-9) 
and the median number of bleeds experienced after the change was 1 (range 0-2). Six subjects 
changed to every 5 days, and 2 subjects changed to 2x/week infusion. One subject previously on every 
5 days switched to every 7 day treatment. At the end of the study, 20 subjects were treated 2x/week, 
32 subjects treated every 5 days, and 8 subjects every 7 days.

Characteristics of bleeds 
Table 31 summarizes the location and severity of bleeds for subjects by age group. 
Table 31: Summary of bleed location and severity (ITT set) 
Overall most of the bleeds in the two age groups combined were joint bleeds (40.0%) followed by 
skin/mucosa bleeds (29.3%). In the 6 to <12 years old group, 50% of bleeds were reported as joint 
bleeds, whereas in the <6 years group most bleeds were skin or mucosa bleeds (41.7%). Only 10% of 
all bleeds were of severe intensity. In all subjects with joint bleeds, the joint bleeds primarily did not 
affect the target joints with 91.1% of joint bleeds occurring in a non-target joint or the subject had no 
target joint(s) (Table 31).  
Table 32 summarizes the time since the previous infusion for subjects in both age groups for the ITT 
set.

Subjects with less frequent infusions had a longer duration of protection with subjects in the every 7 
day treatment group having the longest mean duration between previous infusions and bleeds at 4.45 
(± 1.43) days in the younger age group and 4.87 ( ± 0.59) days in the older age group. 
Treatment of bleeds 
Table 33 summarizes the treatment administration for bleeds by age group and overall. 
Table 33: Summary of treatment administration for bleeds per subject by age group (ITT 
subjects treated for bleeds) 
Across both age groups, there were a total of 140 bleeds treated with damoctocog alfa pegol. The dose 
used and the decision for repeated infusion were left to the discretion of the subject/caregiver and the 
treating physician as per the protocol. Bleeds were treated with damoctocog alfa pegol using an overall 
mean dose (±SD) of 46.8 (± 11.3) IU/kg/infusion. The data suggest that subjects tended to treat their 
bleeds with similar doses as used for prophylaxis. 
A summary of treatment attributes for bleeds on a per subject basis is shown in  
Table 34.

Table 34: Summary of treatment attributes for bleeds per subject (ITT set) 
A total of 118 bleeds were treated with 1 infusion (84.3%), 11 bleeds (7.9%) were treated with 2 
infusions, and 11 (7.9%) required 3 or more infusions. The median time interval between the 1st and 
the 2nd infusion was 1.06 days across both age groups ( 
Table 34). 
Response to treatment of bleeds 
For each bleed, subjects/caregivers assessed adequacy of haemostasis in the EPD. Table 35 provides a 
summary of the subject/caregiver assessment of adequacy of haemostasis by age group and overall. 
No physician assessment of adequacy of haemostasis was collected since no subjects were hospitalized 
for surgery or a major bleeding event. Overall, adequacy of haemostasis was rated as either good or 
excellent 85.7% of the time (Table 35).

In vivo recovery 
Samples for damoctocog alfa pegol trough and recovery levels were collected in all subjects during the 
main study. Plasma concentrations of FVIII were measured using a validated enzymatic FVIII activity 
assay (chromogenic assay). The mean (range) of overall recovery value was 1.809 kg/dL (0.68-2.56) 
in the <6 years of age group and 2.271 kg/dL (1.42-6.13) in the 6 to <12 years of age group. In 
general, the FVIII recovery values were similar across visits.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
No analyses across trials (pooled analyses or meta-analyses) have been submitted.  
Extension phases of both PROTECT VIII and PROTECT Kids are ongoing and interim data have been 
submitted.  
PROTECT VIII 
Part A 
The extension of Part A of this clinical trial included subjects aged 12-65 years with severe haemophilia 
A who had completed the Part A main trial. A total of 121 subjects signed informed consent and 
started treatment in the extension. Subjects who signed consent for the Part A extension were given a 
± 1-week grace period to switch from on-demand to prophylaxis or to another dosing regimen within 
the prophylaxis group.  
Fourteen subjects who received on-demand treatment during the Part A extension had 514 total 
bleeds. The median was 40.0 total bleeds (range: 10-63) over the reporting period for this interim 
analysis, corresponding to an ABR of 32.96. There were no subjects (0%) in the on-demand group that 
had 0 bleeds during the Part A extension. 
One hundred seven subjects were treated in the Part A extension in one of the prophylaxis treatment 
arms and all were included in the ITT population. Subjects in the prophylaxis treatment arms had 428 
total bleeds over the reporting period for this interim analysis, corresponding to a median ABR of 1.17. 
Within the prophylaxis treatment arm, the median ABR was 2.21 for the 2x/week group, 1.17 for the 
every 5 days group, 0.54 for the every 7 days group, and 3.94 for the “variable frequency” group. 
“Variable frequency” indicates subjects who changed their treatment regimen at least once after 1st 
infusion beyond 7 days into extension. There were 6 (25.0%) subjects in the 2x/week group, 12

(32.4%) subjects in the every 5 days group, 14 (48.3%) subjects in the every 7 days group, and 1 
(5.9%) subject in the “variable frequency” group that had 0 bleeds during the Part A extension. 
Damoctocog alfa pegol was effective for the treatment of bleeds with 92.2% of bleeds effectively 
treated with 1-2 infusions. Bleeds were treated according to local standard of care, using a mean 
(±SD) dose of 38.9 (±12.0) IU/kg/infusion. Patient-reported assessment of response to treatment was 
“excellent” or “good” in all cases where an assessment was applicable/reported.  
The adequacy of haemostasis during minor surgery was assessed as either “good” or “excellent” in all 
cases (for 1 surgery, the assessment was missing). The blood loss was minimal and no haemostasis-
related complications were reported. 
Part B 
The extension of Part B of this clinical trial was offered to subjects enrolled in the Part A extension who 
required a major surgical procedure and were willing to use damoctocog alfa pegol to provide 
haemostasis. Per protocol, major surgery was defined as any surgical or invasive procedure (elective 
or emergent) in which the overall bleeding risk may be excessive, would require a general anesthetic in 
an individual without a bleeding disorder, penetrated or exposed a major body cavity, could result in 
substantial impairment of physical or physiological functions, or required special anatomic knowledge 
or manipulative skill (eg, tonsillectomy, laparotomy, thoracotomy, joint replacement). 
Three subjects successfully completed 3 surgeries during the Part B extension before the cutoff date 
for the interim analysis using damoctocog alfa pegol for haemostasis. Treatment with damoctocog alfa 
pegol provided ‘good’ haemostatic control during these major surgeries with blood loss within expected 
levels. The cumulative median total dose of all infusions for major surgeries was 24420.0 IU with a 
median total dose of 277.1 IU/kg. 
Overall, the concentrations of damoctocog alfa pegol in plasma in the peri-surgery period were similar 
to that in the pre-surgery period. 
PROTECT Kids 
The purpose of the expansion arm (Part 2) was to better characterize and define the mechanism of the 
AEs of special interest observed during the main study, and their frequency. 
Part 2 of this clinical trial enrolled 12 subjects <6 years of age with severe haemophilia A (FVIII <1%) 
and ≥50 prior ED. Subjects were treated prophylactically with damoctocog alfa pegol on a twice weekly 
schedule. Doses were selected by the investigator and may have been adjusted as needed in the range 
of 25-60 IU/kg. Damoctocog alfa pegol was also used for treatment of any breakthrough bleeding 
events. 
Four out of the 12 treated subjects dropped out due to adverse events of special interest; specifically, 
due to hypersensitivity reaction in 1 subject and loss of efficacy in 3 subjects. The subject who 
presented a hypersensitivity reaction also had undetectable FVIII levels 28 hours after his last infusion 
of study drug, indicating evidence of an increased clearance that was not manifested clinically. 
All events of special interest occurred within the first 4 exposure days, confirming the findings 
observed during the main study. The incidence of the events of special interest was also similar to that 
observed during the main study. 
Antibodies against PEG were detected in all 4 subjects with events of special interest. Three of these 
patients had pre-existing anti-PEG antibodies. Pre-existing low titer positive antibodies reacting with 
Assessment report  
EMA/698571/2018

damoctocog alfa pegol/PEG were detected in 3 additional subjects who did not have reported AEs of 
hypersensitivity or loss of efficacy of the drug product, suggesting a low positive predictive value for 
the presence of anti-PEG antibodies. 
However, an antibody positivity with increase in titers above 1:64 which peaked around the time of the 
events (especially for the anti-PEG IgM antibody), was observed in 3 out of 4 subjects with events of 
special of interest. In 1 subject with an AE of special interest, only NAbs could be identified during the 
event, but the subject was also positive for NAb and anti-PEG IgM at screening. On the other hand, 
there were 4 additional subjects without events of special interest who had transient positive 
antibodies but did not have increase in titers; 3 of these subjects had positive antibodies at baseline 
with a decrease in titers after exposure to study drug, and antibody test results that were negative 
after additional exposures.  
The timeframe of the events and the transient nature of anti-PEG antibodies in the affected subjects 
supports the hypothesis that this is a T-cell independent, B-cell response mediated mainly by IgM 
antibodies.  
Additional clinical information was collected in order to detect potential clinical predictors and also to 
understand if some environmental factors stimulating the immune response to PEG could be involved. 
It was observed that 3 out of 4 subjects with events of special interest presented signs of infection 
right before or within the first exposures to study drug, while the same was observed only for 1 out of 
8 subjects without events of special interest. This suggests that stimulation of the immune system 
around the time of the first exposures could be predisposing the development of immune response 
directed to PEG, however this finding is not sufficiently conclusive. 
No patients aged 65 years and older were enrolled in the clinical studies. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The design of the two submitted pivotal clinical trials investigating the efficacy (PROTECT VIII study in 
PTPs ≥12 years and PROTECT Kids study PTPs <12 years) of Jivi follows and exceeds the 
requirements of the currently CHMP guideline for recombinant FVIII products 
(EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009 rev. 1) regarding the number and age distribution of subjects 
included and fulfils the guideline requirements regarding the number of exposure days observed. In 
addition, part B of PROTECT VIII study (main and extension) provides data supporting for the 
management of haemostasis in major and minor surgical procedures. The extension trial is currently 
ongoing and the interim evaluation is available and data from this trial are included in the integrated 
summary of clinical efficacy particularly regarding major surgeries. 
A total of 232 (159 ≥12 years and 73 <12 years) subjects received at least one dose of Jivi. 14 of 
these subjects were exposed to Jivi in phase 1 PK study 13401. In the clinical studies, Jivi was 
investigated for both on-demand treatment as well as for prophylaxis. 
In PROTECT VIII study (PTPs ≥ 12 years), patients self-selected whether to receive on-demand 
treatment or prophylaxis. In the prophylactic group patients with less than 2 spontaneous 
(joint/muscle) bleeds in Weeks 0 to 10 were then randomized 1:1 to either an every 5-day (initially 45 
IU/kg, up to 60 IU/kg) or every 7-day (60 IU/kg) prophylactic regimen for an additional 26 weeks. 
Patients with ≥ 2 spontaneous bleeds during the first 10 weeks (defined as 2x/week 'failed') or those 
who completed the run-in phase after the every 5- and 7-day arms were filled remained in the 
2x/week arm (defined as 'forced') with an increased dosage of 30 to 40 IU/kg (Week 10 to 36).

If patients changed their regimen (i.e., increase in frequency) after randomization because of an 
unacceptable number of bleeds, the period after switch was not included in the calculation of the 
primary endpoint (ABR) by treatment arm (called: without rescue bleeds). The ABR was calculated 
based on the time until they dropped out of the arm. In addition, a subgroup analysis was performed 
for those patients who stayed in the randomized treatment arm (not rescued/completers). For the 
analysis of the extension study, a new treatment arm was defined as ‘variable frequency’ arm, which 
included all patients who switched regimen after start of the extension period. 
The target rate of 50% response for prophylactic treatment was achieved overall, so the trial achieved 
its pre-specified efficacy objective. Comparisons between different prophylaxis regimes are difficult to 
interpret as allocation to groups was generally systematic rather than randomized. However, the only 
randomized comparison does show a trend which favour every 7 days over every 5 days in terms of 
response rates, though the difference would not have just missed statistical significance at 
conventional levels. This trend was maintained in all the sensitivity analyses. The ABR was much lower 
for patients who opted for prophylactic treatment than those who opted for on-demand treatment. 
In the PROTECT Kids study (PTPs < 12 years), subjects with at least 50 EDs during the main part of 
the study are included in the efficacy analysis. In addition, the main efficacy endpoint, ABR, as well as 
FVIII dosing and consumption are included for the last 90 days of prophylaxis treatment, after 
adaptation of the regimen as compared to the early treatment phase, in which several patients 
received lower dosages as compared to the last three months. Patients who switched the regimen were 
analysed in the ‘variable frequency’ arm. 
Due to the low number of patients in some regimens, the results for PTPs < 12 years of age have to be 
interpreted with caution. Whereas in the younger age group, the number of patients was similar across 
the different treatment regimens, the number of patients assigned to each of the dose regimens varied 
largely in the older age group, with most patients being treated with an every 5-day or 2x/week 
regimen.   
After allowing for changes in regimen and dosage at the discretion of the investigator, most patients 
obtained a stable dose in the last 90 days of the study.  Most switches of regimen occurred in the 
every 7-day treatment arm.  The ABR derived from the last 90 days in the main study demonstrate an 
overall decrease to median ABRs of 0 in both age groups. Whereas the treatment regimen of 2x/week 
and every 5 days demonstrated an improvement as compared to the first months of treatment, the 
every 7-day treatment regimen showed an increase in ABR, but the number of patients in this 
treatment arm was quite low to draw any definitive conclusion. 
Regarding the effects of Jivi in surgery, surgeons’ assessments of subjects’ response to surgery on a 4-
point scale as well as intra- and postoperative blood loss, transfusion requirements, bleeding episodes 
and consumption were defined as efficacy endpoints, in line guideline requirements. Jivi appears 
effective regarding haemostasis during surgery. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In the PROTECT VIII Study, the mean bleeding rates were statistically significantly lower for 
prophylactic treatment compared to on-demand based on estimates from a negative binomial 
regression model confirming the beneficial effect of prophylaxis with Jivi observed in this trial. These 
annualised bleeding rates are consistent with the results from similar studies with other licensed FVIII 
products.  
Regarding the efficacy in the treatment of bleeding events, in 82.6% of bleeds in the prophylactic arm 
and 65.8% of bleeding episodes in the on-demand arm, the response to Jivi was rated as excellent or 
Assessment report  
EMA/698571/2018  
Page 89/114 
 
 
 
 
 
good and 83.6% in the prophylactic and 82.5% in the on-demand arms were treated by single 
infusion. 
In the PROTECT Kids Study, regarding response to treatment of bleeding events, the response to Jivi 
was rated as excellent or good in 89.6% in children aged < 6 years and 83.8% in those aged 6 to 
< 12 years. However, the number of children investigated (25 < 6 years and 28 6 to < 12 years) is 
relatively low although the study findings are within the range of published results of similar trials with 
other licensed factor VIII products.  
The median annual consumption (IU/kg/year) of FVIII was 3985.7 IU/kg/year in the age group < 6 
years and was slightly higher in the every 5-day arm as compared to the every 7-day arm.  For the 
age group 6 to < 12 years, the median consumption was 3535.4 IU/kg/years. These values appear 
comparable to those observed in other licensing trials with factor VIII products. 
The guideline requirement to submit data of a minimum of 5 patients undergoing at least 10 
surgical procedures (comprising major surgeries) is exceeded. The efficacy of Jivi during surgery 
was evaluated in 16 patients for major and 19 patients with minor surgeries involving a total of 20 
major and 34 minor procedures. All evaluable surgeries were assessed as excellent or good by the 
surgeon.  
The proposed posology was questioned during several rounds of assessment and further 
documentation and expert discussion was requested and subsequently provided by the Applicant. 
Ultimately, it was considered appropriate to recommend a posology for prophylactic treatment of 45-
60 IU/kg every 5 days as the backbone of therapy with a possibility of tailoring of treatment regimen 
based on the individual patient’s clinical response. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The submitted data are considered sufficient to demonstrate the efficacy of Jivi for the prevention and 
treatment of bleeding events in patients with Haemophilia A including efficacy during surgery. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Demonstration of the clinical safety of Jivi is based on the following clinical studies:   
• 
• 
• 
Phase 1 study in PTPs ≥ 18 years of age 
PROTECT VIII study in PTPs ≥ 12 years of age  
PROTECT Kids study in PTPs < 12 years of age.   
Patient exposure 
A total of 148 PTPs ≥ 12 years of age were included in the safety analysis, ie, 14 from the Phase 1 
study and 134 from the PROTECT VIII study (Main and Interim Extension).  Overall, the number of 
premature discontinuations was low (Phase 1 study: 0%, PROTECT VIII Main study: 6.0%, PROTECT 
VIII Interim Extension study: 4.5%).  A total of 18,432 EDs were achieved.  The median number of 
days in the study was 713 days (range: 0 1 to 952 days) during which the patients accumulated a

median of 131 EDs (range: 1 to 309 days).  103 patients had accumulated at least 100 EDs to Jivi by 
the end of the studies or interim extension analysis and 19 patients achieved 50 to < 100 EDs. 
Of the 81 PTPs < 12 years of age enrolled in the PROTECT Kids Main study or Part 2, 73 received at 
least one dose of treatment (44 patients 0 to < 6 years, and 29 patients 6 to 12 years).  16.4% of the 
patients discontinued the study, the majority of them were younger than 6 years and discontinued due 
to AEs.  These 73 pediatric PTPs, achieved a total of 3219 EDs.  The median number of days in the 
study was 237 days (range: 15 to 448 days) during which the patients accumulated a median of 53 
EDs (range: 1 to 68 days).  53 patients had accumulated at least 50 EDs to Jivi by the end of the 
study. 
The number of patients who were randomized, treated, and prematurely discontinued from the studies 
and the respective primary reasons are shown in

Overall, TEAEs were reported for 83.1% and 83.6% of the PTPs ≥ 12 years and <12 years of age, 
respectively.  The frequency of drug-related TEAEs was lower in the adolescent/adult population 
(10.1%) as compared to the pediatric population (17.8%), with a frequency of 25% in the age group < 
6 years.  For most patients in either population, the maximum intensity of TEAEs was mild or 
moderate.  Among PTPs ≥ 12 years, there were 33 patients (22.3%) with treatment-emergent SAEs; 
4 of them experienced drug-related SAEs (drug hypersensitivity, overdose, liver function test 
increased, and back pain).  4 patients discontinued due to AEs (1 patient with hypersensitivity) or SAEs 
(1 patient each with drug hypersensitivity, liver function test increased, or back pain).   
11 patients (15%) discontinued due to AEs or SAEs, 10 patients < 6 years of age and 1 patient 6 to < 
12 years of age. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
No patient died in the course of the clinical development program of Jivi. 
A total of 33 patients PTPs ≥ 12 years of age experienced at least one treatment-emergent SAE 
based on a median observation time of 713 days in the study.  Except for hemophilic arthropathy (3 
patients), device-related infection, and hemarthrosis (2 patients each), all SAEs were single 
occurrences.  There were 4 patients with SAEs classified as related to Jivi (drug hypersensitivity, 
overdose, liver function test increased, and back pain) and 3 patients discontinued due to SAEs (drug 
hypersensitivity, liver function test increased, and back pain). 
Among the PTPs ≥ 12 years of age, there were 7 patients with SAEs related to bleeding events 
(gastrointestinal hemorrhage, mouth hemorrhage, retroperitoneal hematoma, hemarthrosis, pelvic 
hemorrhage, and hematoma).  These bleeds were carefully assessed in order to exclude LoE. 
There were 13 PTPs <12 years (17.8%) with treatment-emergent SAEs, 10 of whom were < 6 years 
of age and 3 were 6 to < 12 years of age.  8 patients experienced drug-related SAEs (some of them 
more than 1): 4 patients with preferred term drug hypersensitivity or hypersensitivity, 3 patients with 
preferred term drug specific antibody present, and one patient each with preferred terms anti factor 
VIII antibody positive (reported as ‘suspected inhibitor’, FVIII inhibitor ruled out by laboratory tests, 
but ADAs were found) and drug ineffective.  In Part B of the PROTECT VIII study, there were 2 tests  
positive for FVIII inhibitors which were reported as drug-related SAEs. In one patient, a FVIII inhibitor 
Assessment report  
EMA/698571/2018  
Page 93/114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
antibody level of 1.7 BU/mL was detected after a single study drug exposure as part of pre-operative 
PK evaluation.  Testing obtained at the post-operative visit, did not confirm the FVIII inhibitor 
antibody.  The positive FVIII inhibitor result was considered unconfirmed and transient.  In the second 
patient, a low titer FVIII inhibitor antibody (0.5 BU/mL) was detected during screening and was 
considered a pre-existing inhibitor. A second sample confirmed the low titer pre-existing  FVIII 
inhibitor antibody of 0.6 BU/mL prior to the first surgery and FVIII inhibitor antibody of 0.7 BU/mL was 
confirmed in a sample collected after the second surgery, with anti-Jivi antibodies also positive in the 
post-surgical sample. This patient is considered having a pre-existing FVIII inhibitor. Seven weeks 
after switching to another product, an FVIII inhibitor antibody titer of 2.7 BU/mL was detected in the 
central laboratory. Both patients had reduced recovery and half-life of study drug demonstrated pre-
operatively. 
No patient developed FVIII inhibitor levels > 0.2 BU/mL during treatment in Part B of the PROTECT 
VIII Interim Extension 
For PTPs < 12 years of age, 13 patients experienced treatment-emergent SAEs.  8 patients had SAEs 
classified as drug-related:  4 patients reported the PTs hypersensitivity or drug hypersensitivity, 3 
patients reported the PT drug specific antibody present, and for 1 patient the PT drug ineffective was 
reported.  In addition, one case of suspected inhibitor (reported term; PT: anti-factor VIII antibody 
positive, later identified as ADA) was classified as drug-related SAEs.  All other SAEs were single 
occurrences. 
Evaluation of Significant Adverse Events 
The following categories are presented in more detail as they are considered to be of particular 
relevance regarding the safety of BAY 94-9027:  
• 
• 
FVIII inhibitors (reported SAEs and laboratory evaluations) 
Loss of Efficacy (LoE) 
•  Hypersensitivity reactions (reported as SAEs or leading to discontinuation, and based on 
standardized MedDRA queries [SMQs]) 
•  Adverse events leading to discontinuation 
FVIII Inhibitors 
The development of inhibitors against FVIII is considered a major complication in the treatment of 
haemophilia A. 
Patients were to be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors to FVIII (the primary safety 
variable) by appropriate clinical observations and based upon the central laboratory results using the 
Nijmegen Bethesda assay.  Any positive result was to be confirmed by a recovery and a second 
sample.   
In summary, there were 2 PTPs ≥ 12 years of age with major surgeries in Part B of the PROTECT 
VIII Main study (patients with major surgery) who had low titer FVIII inhibitors (< 5 BU; preferred 
terms: anti-factor VIII antibody positive) reported as drug-related SAEs, one of them had a pre-
existing low titer FVIII inhibitor, in the second patient the inhibitor was not confirmed.   
No de novo or confirmed cases of inhibitor against factor VIII occurred. A single unconfirmed positive 
result of a low titre of factor VIII inhibitor (1.7 BU/mL) was reported in one adult patient following a 
surgery. 
Assessment report  
EMA/698571/2018  
Page 94/114 
 
 
 
 
 
No PTP < 12 years of age had positive FVIII inhibitor levels (≥ 0.6 BU/mL) during the PROTECT Kids 
Main study or Part 2.  Five patients had detectable FVIII inhibitors above the level of quantification but 
below the cut-off for positivity (< 0.6 BU), three of them already before drug exposure. These three 
patients were also positive for anti-Jivi antibodies, but had negative testing for anti-PEG antibodies, 
suggesting the Jivi screening assay was sensitive to all antibodies directed against the molecule. None 
of the patients developed a FVIII inhibitor above the threshold for positivity. 
In the course of the PROTECT Kids Main study, the preferred term anti-factor VIII antibody positive 
was recorded for a boy after 5 EDs as drug-related SAE and reason for discontinuation. At the same 
time the preferred term drug hypersensitivity was reported for this patient Testing ruled out FVIII 
inhibitor; however, this patient was positive for anti-PEG antibodies. 
Loss of Efficacy (LoE) 
The study protocol of the Phase 1 and PROTECT VIII study in PTPs ≥ 12 years of age did not provide 
a definition of AEs of special interest such as for LoE.  Therefore, potential events of LoE were not 
recorded as AE of special interest.  However, bleeding events reported as SAEs were retrospectively 
assessed for potential involvement of LoE.  None of the described bleeding events led to study 
discontinuation or were suspicious of any LoE.  LoE was not reported during the study. 
In the PROTECT Kids study in PTPs < 12 years of age, LoE was defined as AEs of special interest (as 
of Amendment 2) and was to be reported as AE.  In addition, ADA and FVIII inhibitor testing was to be 
obtained.  LoE was to be documented by FVIII levels pre- and post-infusion of the study drug, using 
appropriate laboratory measures, and confirmed in the central laboratory.  
For a total of 8 patients (all < 6 years of age), LoE was associated with SAE reporting or was reported 
as AE of special interest.  All of them dropped-out of the study. First symptoms of LoE were observed 
as bruising or hematoma not responsive to treatment with Jivi and occurred in all patients during the 
first 4 exposures to Jivi. No life threatening bleeds were reported. In patients with a sample following 
infusion of Jivi, an unexpected low recovery was measured.  In all cases, testing for a FVIII inhibitor 
was negative and all patients could be treated effectively with another FVIII product.  
An additional assessment of LoE looking at post-infusion Jivi recovery revealed 3 additional patients 
who withdrew due to hypersensitivity reactions.  All of them were < 6 years old.  ADAs against PEG 
and neutralising anti-damocatocog alfa pegol antibodies were detected in these patients. 
Overall, no PTPs 6 years or above experienced clinical LoE. LoE was only observed in the age group 
< 6 years and was related to ADAs against PEG (anti-PEG IgM) which developed within the first 4 EDs 
resulting in a low recovery or no detectable activity after the infusion of Jivi. LoE was not observed at 
any later time points during the main study or extension study. Clinical observations included 
unexpected bleeding, mainly bruising, or no response to treatment of bleeds. Anti-PEG IgM antibody 
titers and/or positive results for neutralizing anti-damoctocog alfa pegol antibodies were detected in 10 
of the 11 patients with signs or symptoms of LoE. Some of these patients had pre-existing anti-PEG 
IgM antibodies, but pre-existing anti-PEG antibodies did not predict this reaction.  
From these results it can be concluded, that the LoE was related to neutralising anti-PEG IgM 
antibodies which developed in all patients within the first 4 EDs. The efficacy of the patient’s previous 
product was not affected. All patients returned to their previous FVIII treatment without any problems.  
Hypersensitivity Reactions 
In the following paragraphs, cases of hypersensitivity either reported as AE/SAE or leading to study 
discontinuation, and based on a more conservative approach via SMQs and selected preferred terms 
Assessment report  
EMA/698571/2018  
Page 95/114 
 
 
 
 
 
are summarized.  The latter analysis includes all kinds of symptoms, even those distantly related to 
hypersensitivity reactions.   
For two PTPs ≥ 12 years of age, the preferred terms drug hypersensitivity or hypersensitivity were 
reported by the investigator during Part A of the PROTECT VIII study as SAEs and led to 
discontinuation of the study.  They occurred during early treatment, ie, after the first or fourth dose.  
One patient had associated positive antibodies against PEG (IgM) which were already present before 
the first exposure to Jivi and increased during the reaction.  The second patient with the 
hypersensitivity reaction during the first exposure did not present anti-PEG antibodies.  In another 
patient, rash erythematous (event which could have been related to hypersensitivity according to 
SMQs) was reported as non-serious AE leading to transient drug interruption and no further AE after 
resuming treatment.  No PEG antibodies were detected for this patient. 
The most frequently reported events were headache (14.2%), cough (6.8%), nausea (5.4%), vomiting 
(3.4%), conjunctivitis and dizziness (2.0%). Most of these events were assessed as not drug-related.  
Overall, this search did not reveal any additional safety concerns in relation to the frequency and type 
of these potential hypersensitivity symptoms in PTPs ≥ 12 years of age.   
There were 4 PTPs < 12 years of age, 3 from the PROTECT Kids Main study and 1 from Part 2, with 
hypersensitivity reactions reported as SAEs and were considered to be related to the study drug.  
Except for one 6-year old patient, all were younger than 6 years. The 6-year old patient did not 
present anti-PEG antibodies and he had a normal recovery after Jivi infusion; therefore, this 
hypersensitivity reaction was interpreted as a PEG unrelated reaction. All 3 patients < 6 years had 
anti-PEG IgM antibodies with increasing titers in 2 patients who had samples during the 
hypersensitivity reaction; therefore, the hypersensitivity reactions were considered an immune 
response to PEG. In addition, positive results for neutralizing anti-Jivi antibodies and low recovery 
following infusion of Jivi was documented in all 3 patients < 6 years of age.   
An additional analysis of preferred terms by standardized MedDRA queries (SMQs) and selected 
preferred terms in order to detect events even distantly related to hypersensitivity reactions showed 
that 35.6% of the patients < 12 years of age reported at least one event that could potentially be 
associated. The most frequently reported terms were headache and cough (8 patients each, 11%), 
vomiting and rash (5 patients each, 6.8%), and hypersensitivity (4 patients, 5.5%). Other TEAEs of 
this kind were reported for single patients only.   
Other potential hypersensitivity symptoms based on standardized MedDRA queries [SMQs] were 
observed with Jivi in the absence of any ADAs and were classified as class effect.  These events 
occurred at any time during the study, were transient and were not accompanied by anti-PEG 
antibodies and did not result in discontinuation. Only in 2 patients (a boy and an adult), 
hypersensitivity reactions (reported as AE) which occurred during first exposure resulted in 
discontinuation in the absence of any positive ADAs. 
Data from both studies showed that hypersensitivity reactions were reported with a higher frequency 
in a subset of patients with pre-existing anti-PEG IgM antibodies than among patients without pre-
existing anti-PEG IgM. Nevertheless, pre-existing anti—PEG antibodies were not predictive of a clinical 
reaction. The anti-PEG IgM antibody titer increased after exposure to Jivi with neutralising activity 
against Jivi during the reaction in both, patients with or without pre-existing antibodies. These 
reactions occurred all within the first 4 EDs. Except for one adult, PEG related hypersensitivity occurred 
only in children below 6 years of age. The hypersensitivity reactions did not appear to progress to 
anaphylaxis and were accompanied by low or no detectable recovery after Jivi infusion in children 
below 6 years of age.

Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation 
The main reasons for discontinuation of treatment were drug related hypersensitivity reactions or 
perceived LoE.  Patients discontinued the study after 1 to 8 EDs. Most patients (10 of 15), who 
discontinued the study due to AE were below 6 years of age. 
During Part A of the PROTECT VIII Main or Interim Extension study a total of 4 (3.0%) PTPs ≥ 12 
years of age, had TEAEs that led to study medication discontinuation (hypersensitivity, increased liver 
function test, and thrombocytopenia and back pain).  In addition, one patient with major surgery (Part 
B of the PROTECT VIII Main study) discontinued study drug due to SAEs (anti-factor VIII antibody 
positive and haematoma)).  Another patient developed a rash and study drug was interrupted due to 
this AE.  The event was classified as neither drug-related nor serious. This subject later returned to the 
study extension and re-started study drug without adverse reactions 
Overall, the number of patients with TEAEs leading to discontinuation was higher in the pediatric 
population. Among PTPs < 12 years of age, patients generally discontinued the study due to 
hypersensitivity reactions (4 patients, 3 of them < 6 years) or LoE (8 patients, all < 6 years) shortly 
after start of treatment: 
Loss of efficacy associated study discontinuation (8 patients): 
Perceived LoE presenting as unexpected bleeding or bruising not responsive to study drug during the 
first 4 exposures occurred in 8 subjects (5 in main study, 3 in Part 2) resulting in discontinuation. LoE 
was confirmed by an abnormal low recovery or no detectable activity after Jivi infusion (<1% per 
IU/kg) in the absence of a FVIII inhibitor.  All patients except for one had detectable anti-PEG IgM 
and/or neutralizing Jivi antibodies. Only in one of these patients, no ADAs could be identified despite 
an abnormal low recovery after Jivi infusion. 
Hypersensitivity-related study discontinuation (4 patients): 
In the PROTECT Kids study, four patients experienced hypersensitivity within the first 4 EDs and 
discontinued within a few weeks. Only patients < 6 years of age had positive anti-PEG IgM antibodies 
at baseline and during the study. For these patients, evidence of LoE was noted based on the low post-
infusion FVIII levels/recovery. 
All patients who discontinued the study returned to their previous FVIII treatment without any 
problems and a normal recovery was confirmed in all patients who experienced a recovery with their 
previous FVIII product after the diagnosis of LoE with study drug.  
The incidence rate of a clinical immune response to PEG was around 25% in patients < 6 years, it was 
low (<1%) in patients ≥ 6 years of age.  LoE was reported in 11/44 PTPs < 6 years (10 of them with 
ADAs) and was not reported for any patient ≥ 6 years.  The risk of an immune response to PEG 
presenting as hypersensitivity and/or LoE was observed only within the first 4 EDs to Jivi.  No 
additional cases were observed at any other time point up to > 100 exposures. The immune responses 
to Jivi did not result in any major complication or life-threatening events for the patients. After 
withdrawal from the treatment, all patients returned to their previous FVIII product with normal 
recoveries and efficacy.   
A clear explanation or risk factor for the observed immune response could not be identified, and pre-
exposure testing for anti-PEG IgM appeared not to be a strong predictor.

Laboratory findings 
General Safety Laboratory Evaluations 
In the Phase 1, PROTECT VIII and PROTECT Kids studies, general safety laboratory evaluations 
included complete blood count, serum chemistry, urine analysis and serology, and were performed 
prior to start of treatment and at several visits throughout the studies. 
For PTPs ≥ 12 years of age, the observed shifts in safety laboratory values were generally not 
considered clinically relevant except for 3 cases with reported drug related AE ‘liver function test 
increased’  and ‘alanine aminotransferase increased’. All cases had pre-existing concomitant  liver 
pathology. .  
Treatment emergent high abnormal values for alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) were seen in approximately 12% of the patients.  Abnormal high levels of liver 
enzymes were already noticed before start of treatment, ie, for more than 20% (ALT) or more than 
12% (AST) of the patients.  A medical history of hepatitis C was reported for 60% of the patients.  
Increases in hepatic enzymes are frequently observed in this patient population with a high incidence 
of concomitant liver disease. 
For PTPs < 12 years of age, none of the observed shifts in safety laboratory values was considered 
clinically relevant in this subject population and none was reported as an AE by the investigator. 
Safety in special populations 
Region/race 
For PTPs ≥ 12 years of age, safety data were analyzed for the following region/race subgroups based 
on the combined analysis across the Phase 1 and PROTECT VIII studies:  
Region: Asia vs. Europe/Israel versus North America/South America 
Race: Asian versus White versus Other 
Safety results in these subgroups did not raise any additional safety concerns.   
Age 
Age of subjects included in the studies ranged from 2 to 65 years.  
Elderly Population 
Clinical studies of Jivi did not include subjects aged 65 and over. Safety of Jivi could therefore not be 
analysed separately for subjects ≥65 years of age. 
Use in Pregnancy and Lactation 
Clinical experience with Jivi in pregnant women is not available. Animal reproduction studies have not 
been conducted with Jivi. It is unknown whether Jivi can cause fatal harm when administered to a 
pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. 
There is no information regarding the presence of Jivi in human milk, the effect on the breastfed 
infant, or the effects on milk production. 
Patients with Pre-existing Antibodies 
Assessment report  
EMA/698571/2018  
Page 98/114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A patient with pre-existing antibody was defined as a patient with a positive measurement at baseline 
or screening for either damococtocg alfa pegol antibody, or PEG antibody.   
Pre-existing ADAs were detected in 21 patients, 4 PTPs ≥ 12 years and 17 PTPs < 12 years.  
Antibodies were mainly related to PEG.  The type of antibodies was IgM.  Besides age, no other 
relevant differences regarding demography and baseline disease characteristics were noticed between 
patients with or without ADAs prior to treatment.   Pre-existing anti-PEG antibodies were not predictive 
of a clinical reaction.   
In patients without a clinical reaction, pre-existing anti-PEG antibodies disappeared despite continues 
exposure. Also patients, who discontinued Jivi treatment after an increase of antibody titer associated 
with the clinical reaction, demonstrated a decrease of antibodies or disappearance at the final visit.  No 
AEs of special interest were reported after discontinuation of Jivi. No anti-PEG IgG antibodies were 
induced.  Therefore, no long-term immune memory was observed.  
Patients with Hepatic Impairment 
Jivi contains a recombinant replacement protein of the naturally occurring coagulation factor, FVIII that 
is catabolized. Since Jivi is not metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP), it is not expected that hepatic 
impairment will affect the PK of Jivi. Therefore, no studies were conducted in patients with hepatic 
impairment.  
Patients with Renal Impairment 
Jivi contains a recombinant replacement protein of the naturally occurring coagulation factor, FVIII that 
is catabolized. Since renal excretion is not expected for Jivi, no PK studies in patients with renal 
impairment have been conducted.   
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No interaction studies have been conducted.  
Jivi contains a recombinant replacement protein of the naturally occurring coagulation factor, the FVIII 
protein is catabolised while the PEG chain likely remains mainly intact. There is no known metabolising 
pathways and no known CYP involvement with coagulation factors. Therefore, no interaction studies 
have been performed with CYP-metabolized drugs potentially administered concomitantly.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The main reasons for discontinuation of treatment were drug related hypersensitivity reactions or 
perceived LoE. Patients discontinued the study after 1 to 8 EDs. Most patients (10 of 15), who 
discontinued the study due to AE were below 6 years of age. 
During Part A of the PROTECT VIII Main or Interim Extension study a total of 4 (3.0%) PTPs ≥ 12 
years of age, had TEAEs that led to study medication discontinuation (1 patient each with 
hypersensitivity, drug hypersensitivity, and increased liver function test, and 1 patient with 
thrombocytopenia and back pain).  In addition, one patient with major surgery (Part B of the PROTECT 
VIII Main study) discontinued study drug due to SAEs (anti-factor VIII antibody positive and 
haematoma)).  Another patient developed a rash and study drug was interrupted due to this AE.  The 
event was classified as neither drug-related nor serious. This subject later returned to the study 
extension and re-started study drug without adverse reactions.  
Overall, the number of patients with TEAEs leading to discontinuation was noticeably higher in the 
pediatric population. Among PTPs < 12 years of age, patients generally discontinued the study due to 
Assessment report

hypersensitivity reactions (4 patients, 3 of them < 6 years) or LoE (8 patients, all < 6 years) shortly 
after start of treatment: 
Loss of efficacy associated study discontinuation (8 patients): 
Perceived LoE presenting as unexpected bleeding or bruising not responsive to study drug during the 
first 4 exposures occurred in 8 subjects (5 in main study, 3 in Part 2) resulting in discontinuation. LoE 
was confirmed by an abnormal low recovery or no detectable activity after Jivi infusion (<1% per 
IU/kg) in the absence of a FVIII inhibitor. All patients except for one had detectable anti-PEG IgM 
and/or neutralizing Jivi antibodies. Only in one of these patients, no ADAs could be identified despite 
an abnormal low recovery after Jivi infusion. 
Hypersensitivity-related study discontinuation (4 patients): 
In the PROTECT Kids Main study, three patients (2 patients < 6 years and 1 patient 6 years) 
experienced hypersensitivity within the first 4 EDs (reported as study drug-related SAEs) and 
discontinued within a few weeks. In Part 2 of the PROTECT Kids study, one 4-year-old patient 
experienced hypersensitivity, reported as drug-related SAE leading to discontinuation after a few days. 
The 3 patients < 6 years of age had positive anti-PEG IgM antibodies at baseline and during the study.  
For these patients, evidence of LoE was noted based on the low post-infusion FVIII levels/recovery. 
The 6-year old patient did not present ADAs and had a normal recovery. 
All patients who discontinued the study returned to their previous FVIII treatment without any 
problems and a normal recovery was confirmed in all patients who experienced a recovery with their 
previous FVIII product after the diagnosis of LoE with study drug.  
The incidence rate of a clinical immune response to PEG was around 25% in patients < 6 years, it was 
low (<1%) in patients ≥ 6 years of age.  LoE was reported in 11/44 PTPs < 6 years (10 of them with 
ADAs) and was not reported for any patient ≥ 6 years.  The risk of an immune response to PEG 
presenting as hypersensitivity and/or LoE was observed only within the first 4 EDs to Jivi. No additional 
cases were observed at any other time point up to > 100 exposures.  The immune responses to Jivi did 
not result in any major complication or life-threatening events for the patients. After withdrawal from 
the treatment, all patients returned to their previous FVIII product with normal recoveries and efficacy.   
A clear explanation or risk factor for the observed immune response could not be identified, and pre-
exposure testing for anti-PEG IgM appeared not to be a strong predictor.   
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The clinical part of the dossier is based on 3 fully completed studies: Phase 1 First-in-Man study, and 
two phase 2/3 studies (PROTECT VIII and PROTECT Kids studies) and from the ongoing extension 
studies in adolescents/adults and in children. Safety assessment was done according to the CHMP 
Guideline on clinical investigation of recombinant factor VIII products. 
A total of 184 adverse events were reported in 148 (83.1%) and 73 (83.6%) of the patients ≥ 12 
years and <12 years of age, respectively. Most of the adverse events were of mild severity and 
considered unrelated to Jivi. The nature and frequency of adverse events does not give rise to concern 
and do not reveal unexpected safety signals. 15 (10.1%) patients ≥ 12 years reported adverse events 
which were considered possibly or probably related to Jivi. Of these, the cases of overdose and pelvic 
hemorrhage were classified as SAEs. The pelvic hemorrhage occurred in the course of the Phase 1 
study, 6 days after the last Jivi dose. Among PTPs < 12 years of age, 13 patients had TEAEs classified 
as drug-related, 11 patients < 6 years (25.0%) and 2 patients 6 to < 12 years of age (6.9%).    
Assessment report  
EMA/698571/2018  
Page 100/114 
 
 
 
 
 
The most frequently reported adverse reactions in clinical trials in PTPs were headache, cough and 
pyrexia.  
The most common adverse events were the following: hypersensitivity, insomnia, headache, dizziness, 
cough, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, erythema, rash, infusion site reactions and pyrexia. There 
were no deaths reported during the clinical development program. 
No thromboembolic event has been reported, but this risk is to be taken into account considering the 
dosing regimen which can be as high as 6000 IU/day. In patients with existing cardiovascular risk 
factors, substitution therapy with factor VIII may increase the cardiovascular risk. 
No major clinically relevant change in laboratory investigations has been detected. There were no 
events of suspected transmission of an infectious agent. No patient developed a new or confirmed 
inhibitor. 
No adverse events were reported in relation to overdose. Several hypersensitivity-related study 
discontinuation cases were reported. They appear to be related to innate immune responses mediated 
by B-1a, B1b, and marginal zone cells and mainly to occur in young children (<6y). Only one adult 
experienced a hypersensitivity reaction, which was not serious and which he recovered fully from. It is 
known that the side effects of all FVIII products are FVIII inhibitor development (with a low incidence 
in PTPs), and allergic type of hypersensitivity reactions which may progress to anaphylaxis including 
shock.  In the current clinical studies, no new and confirmed FVIII inhibitor was observed in PTPs 
treated with Jivi, no anaphylaxis was reported, and no serious cardiovascular event was observed.  
Allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible with Jivi. The medicinal product may contain traces 
of mouse and hamster proteins. Hypersensitivity reactions could also be related to antibodies against 
PEG (see paragraph Immune response to polyethylene glycol (PEG)). If symptoms of hypersensitivity 
occur, patients should be advised to discontinue the use of the medicinal product immediately and 
contact their physician. Patients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions 
including hives, generalized urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension, and anaphylaxis. 
Symptomatic treatment for hypersensitivity should be instituted as appropriate. In case of anaphylaxis 
or shock, the current medical standards for treatment should be implemented. 
The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the 
management of individuals with haemophilia A. These inhibitors are usually IgG immunoglobulins 
directed against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) per 
mL of plasma using the modified Bethesda assay. The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the 
severity of the disease as well as the exposure to factor VIII, this risk being highest within the first 50 
exposure days (ED) but continues throughout life although the risk is uncommon. Rarely, inhibitors 
may develop after the first 50 exposure days. The clinical relevance of inhibitor development will 
depend on the titre of the inhibitor, with low titre posing less of a risk of insufficient clinical response 
than high titre inhibitors. 
In general, all patients treated with coagulation factor VIII products should be carefully monitored for 
the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests. 
If the expected factor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with 
an appropriate dose, testing for factor VIII inhibitor presence should be performed. In patients with 
high levels of inhibitor, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should 
be considered. Management of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the 
care of haemophilia and factor VIII inhibitors.

The risk of an immune response to PEG has been identified which resulted in loss of efficacy (please 
see RMP section), observed as bruising or bleeding not responsive to treatment with Jivi and lower 
than expected recovery following Jivi infusion in the absence of FVIII inhibitors and occurred mainly in 
children < 6 years. The immune response was characterised by the development of IgM antibodies 
directed against the PEG, which were neutralising for Jivi activity and resulting in loss of efficacy of the 
study medication and decreased Jivi activity post-injection. This immune response was accompanied by 
hypersensitivity reactions in some patients. In several cases, the affected patients were found to have 
anti-PEG IgM antibodies prior to first exposure to the study drug. The immune reaction is considered to 
be an immune response of the innate immune system. Warnings and precautions have been added in 
this regard in section 4.4. of the SmPC. 
The overall AE profile for patients ≥12 years was similar to what would be expected for long-term 
studies in the study population and is consistent with previous studies in this target patient population. 
For pediatric patients < 12 years, an increase in hypersensitivity reactions and AEs related to LoE was 
observed particularly in children < 6 years of age. An unexpected high drop-out rate due to these two 
events occurred in this age group and demonstrated an age-dependent difference in the AE profile of 
Jivi. Hypersensitivity reactions can be expected in 0-2% of the patients > 12 years of age. 
Precautionary measures are adequately described in the SmPC; Jivi is only indicated in patients ≥ 12 
years of age. 
From non-clinical studies with other PEGylated products, there is a possible risk of accumulation of PEG 
causing vacuolation in tissues such as in the brain structures and kidney as seen in animal studies. The 
implication of this finding in humans is unclear. As shown with Jivi’s current preclinical study data, 
there is probably no indication of this affecting adult tissue as there were no such Jivi related changes 
in the brain or kidney, including any potential cell vacuolation in ependymal cells of the choroid plexus 
or other cells. Furthermore, it is claimed that Jivi does not appear to cross the blood-barrier (for 
further details, please also refer the Non-Clinical Assessment Report). Safety data from clinical trials 
including data from extension studies with a treatment time up to 5 years do not show any signs of 
cerebral or nervous toxicity (tremors etc) but the risk associated to PEG accumulation, which might be 
observed only after years of exposure, cannot be completely excluded. A potential accumulation of PEG 
moiety in the nervous system tissue or other human tissue is therefore a possibility as well as the 
potential clinical impact on brain development in children e.g. on cognitive, functional or metabolic 
properties. An expert discussion regarding this has been provided by the Applicant. There is currently 
no indication of vacuolation or accumulation of damoctocog alfa pegol, “Long-term potential effects of 
PEG accumulation in the choroid plexus of the brain and other tissues/organs” has been added as an 
important potential risk (please see RMP). As a follow-measure, the Applicant is requested to commit 
to conducting a PASS regarding the long-term safety of the PEG moiety in damoctocog alfa pegol as 
follows: 
In order to investigate the potential effects of PEG accumulation in the choroid plexus of the brain and 
other tissues/organs, the MAH should conduct and submit the results of a non-interventional post-
authorisation safety study according to an agreed protocol. 
In addition, the MAH shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product within 6 
months following authorisation. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the size of the safety database available at the moment is in line with guideline requirements, 
and the nature and frequency of the reported adverse events correspond to what is expected for a

Authorisation. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety:

Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 29 August 2018. The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that damoctocog alfa pegol has not been previously authorised in a medicinal 
product in the European Union. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers damoctocog alfa pegol to be a new active substance 
as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Jivi (damoctocog alfa pegol) is included in 
the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance, which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Jivi  is proposed for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in previously treated patients ≥ 12 
years of age withhaemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency) 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Standard treatment for haemophilia A patients is the replacement of the missing protein by infusion of 
exogenous FVIII concentrates (as plasma-derived FVIII [pdFVIII] or recombinant FVIII [rFVIII] 
concentrates). Treatment regimens are either on-demand therapy (given when a bleed occurs) or 
prophylaxis (which consists of regular infusion of FVIII given every 2 to 3 days to prevent bleeding). In 
the short term, prophylaxis can prevent spontaneous bleeding and in the long term, prophylaxis can 
prevent bleeding into joints that will eventually lead to debilitating arthropathy. 
Prior to the introduction of clotting factor concentrates in the 1960s, the prognosis for haemophilia A 
patients was poor, average life expectancy being 15 to 25 years. Major advances in the safety of 
clotting factor products, including the availability of rFVIII concentrates, the availability of 
comprehensive haemophilia A treatment centres, the institution of routine prophylaxis, the introduction 
of home treatment, as well as the active roles that patients take in self-advocacy, have enabled 
patients with haemophilia A to lead a “close to normal” life. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main clinical studies were PROTECT VIII a phase 2/3 multicenter, open-label, non-controlled, 
partially randomized study to investigate efficacy and safety of treatment with Jivi for prophylaxis, 
treatment of bleeds, and surgeries in PTPs (at least 150 exposure days (EDs) prior to the study), 12 to 
65 years of age, with severe haemophilia A (< 1% FVIII:C) and PROTECT Kids, a phase 3 multicenter, 
open-label, non-controlled study to assess the PK, efficacy, and safety of treatment with Jivi for 
prophylaxis and treatment of bleeds in previously treated children with severe haemophilia A (< 12 
years of age and at least 50 prior EDs with any FVIII concentrates). 
Favourable effects 
The PK parameters of Jivi were adequately characterised in direct comparison with Kogenate FS. In the 
main PK study which was performed in 14 subjects, the mean half-life of Jivi was found to be 18.6 
hours and that of Kogenate 13.3 hours. In general, AUC, t1/2 and MRT were higher and clearance 
lower for Jivi. These findings tend to add to the benefits of Jivi. The PEGylation reduces the clearance 
of Jivi providing a longer FVIII t1/2 and higher AUC compared to standard rFVIII products, resulting in 
a longer duration of effect by maintaining desired threshold levels for a longer period of time, thereby 
allowing less frequent dosing when used in a prophylaxis setting.   
Demonstration of efficacy was based on two clinical trials: study PROTECT VIII in previously treated 
patients (PTPs) 12 to 65 years of age and study PROTECT KIDS in PTPs below 12 years of age with 
severe haemophilia A.

The guideline requirement to submit data of a minimum of 5 patients undergoing at least 10 surgical 
procedures (comprising major surgeries) is exceeded. Major surgery is a challenging model to establish 
the haemostatic efficacy of a new coagulation factor. In study PROTECT VIII the efficacy of Jivi was 
used for haemostatic control in 20 major surgeries in 17 patients during the main Part B or Part B 
extension study. There were no major surgeries in study PROTECT KIDS. Treatment was assessed as 
good or excellent haemostatic control during all major surgeries.   A total of 34 minor surgical 
procedures in 19 patients were reported during PROTECT VIII main trial or extension studies with most 
of the procedures being tooth extractions or other dental procedures.  No patients required blood 
transfusions and the adequacy of haemostasis during minor surgeries was also assessed as either good 
or excellent in all cases where an assessment was reported.  
3.2.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
No patients >65 years of age were included in the studies. However, there is no reason to expect a 
different efficacy profile in the elderly haemophilia patients compared to the population studied.  
The every 7-day regimen was used only in a small number of patients in the age group 6 to < 12 
years.  Therefore, the efficacy of an every 7-day regimen could not be sufficiently supported for this 
age group; this is reflected in the posology section in section 4.2. of the SmPC.  
3.3.  Unfavourable effects 
The PEG related immune response which occurs mainly in young children is expected to occur also in 
PUPs in addition to the well-known FVIII inhibitor risk (approximately 30%).  The combined risks for 
immune response to FVIII and to the PEG moiety may result in a substantial proportion of patients 
being unable to be treated with Jivi in this population.  
Several hypersensitivity-related study discontinuation cases were reported. These appear primarily to 
be caused by an innate immune response. It is known that the side effects of all FVIII products are 
FVIII inhibitor development (with a low incidence in PTPs), and allergic type of hypersensitivity 
reactions which may progress to anaphylaxis including shock.  In the current clinical studies, no new 
and confirmed FVIII inhibitor was observed in PTPs treated with Jivi, no anaphylaxis was reported, and 
no serious cardiovascular event was observed.  
3.4.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The risk of an immune response to PEG has been identified which resulted in LoE (please see RMP), 
observed as bruising or bleeding not responsive to treatment with Jivi and lower than expected 
recovery following Jivi infusion in the absence of FVIII inhibitors. The immune response was 
characterised by the development of IgM antibodies directed against the PEG, which were neutralizing 
for Jivi activity and resulting in LoE of the drug and decreased Jivi activity post-injection. This immune 
response was accompanied by hypersensitivity reactions in some patients. In some cases, the affected 
patients were found to have anti-PEG IgM antibodies prior to first exposure to the study drug, but pre-
existing natural anti-PEG antibodies were not predictive of a clinically relevant immune response.  The 
immune reaction is considered to be an immune response of the innate immune system.  
Although the size of the available database exceeds guideline requirements, the limited number of 
subjects allows only the detection of common and very common adverse events, additional safety 
studies will provide more information on the long term safety (please see RMP).

The significant decrease in the risk of an immune response to PEG with increase in age may be related 
to the developmental change in immunity. A clear age cut for the risk change is difficult to define in 
young children with haemophilia. Inclusion of an appropriate statement in the SmPC has been 
implemented. 
The data show that in the affected subjects, the anti-PEG IgM antibodies were transient and eventually 
disappeared. There seemed to be no cross-reactivity of anti-PEG IgM antibodies with other unmodified 
FVIII products. All patients could be successfully treated with their previous FVIII products. The 
implications of any potential risk to affected patients with exposure to pegylated proteins are unknown. 
Meanwhile inclusion of an appropriate statement in the SmPC has been implemented. 
From a non-clinical perspective, the excretion and distribution behaviour of the PEG moiety was 
investigated in rats in order to evaluate the behaviour of the PEG-linker moiety. Examination of the 
distribution of the PEG moiety indicates distribution to blood, lung, liver, kidneys, the testes and to 
lower extent to bone, brain and skeletal muscle.  This has a potential impact on cell vacuolation, 
previously highlighted as a safety risk associated with long term exposure and accumulation of 
pegylated molecules. This could present a more adverse effect in a younger paediatric treatment 
population (<12 years of age). Hence, Jivi is only recommended in patients ≥ 12 years of age. 
Although no PEG accumulation in plasma was detected up to the time of submission of the current 
application, no data beyond 5 years of treatment are available. PEG has been shown to be secreted in 
urine and no deposition in tissue has been reported in animal studies. In clinical trials, no changes in 
renal function (creatinine in serum and creatinine clearance) and no signs of tubular damage based on 
semi-quantitative urinalysis were observed during the extension trials. The AE profile after 3 to 5 years 
of treatment did not demonstrate major changes over time and was similar to the observed AE profile 
in previous FVIII trials. However, detrimental effects of PEG accumulation could appear after 5 years of 
treatment. This represents an uncertainty over long-term. At present, only data for 5 years of 
treatment are available. Nevertheless, current data are reassuring in that there is no change in renal 
function.   
There were no pre-clinical findings of vacuolation in tissues following Jivi-PEG accumulation although 
there was unusually high exposure in the choroid plexus. The clinical relevance of this observation is 
unclear. This finding will need to be explored in the proposed PASS study.

3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The haemostatic capacity of Jivi has been convincingly demonstrated. The applicant has also shown a 
somewhat slower elimination, increased half-life and AUC of Jivi as compared with conventionally 
plasma derived or non-modified recombinant FVIII products. Achieving adequate prevention of 
bleeding events as well as satisfactory treatment of bleeding episodes are expected effects for a 
recombinant coagulation factor. The advantage of Jivi lies in the improved half-life allowing longer 
dosing intervals which reduce the necessary frequency of IV access. 
Administration of Jivi achieves satisfactory prophylaxis of bleeding events, is effective in the treatment 
of bleeds and has been shown to provide adequate perioperative haemostasis with regard to major and 
minor surgical procedures. In addition, the altered PK profile of Jivi allows a somewhat less frequent 
administration of prophylactic infusions.  
Safety concerns regarding FVIII treatment may arise due to the occurrence of inhibitor antibodies, 
which can compromise efficacy. Consequently morbidity and mortality may be increased in the target 
patient population. However, with regards to Jivi treatment, none of the subjects developed an 
inhibitory antibody to FVIII. In addition, the observed safety profile did not differ significantly from that 
expected for a coagulation factor VIII. 
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
From the clinical viewpoint, benefit  of  Jivi is  considered  clinically  relevant  regarding the prevention and 
treatment of bleeding events as well as in the haemostatic management of surgical procedures.  
The Applicant has provided an expert discussion regarding the immunogenicity of damoctocog alfa 
pegol related to the PEG moiety. Antibodies were transient (IgM), underwent no class shift and 
eventually disappeared. The reason for the age-dependency of the immunogenicity and underlying 
mechanisms appear related to the innate immune system. Pre-existing PEG-antibodies do not seem to 
be predictive of an immune response or lack of efficacy. Long-term effects on immunogenicity and 
potential PEG-deposition (e.g. sub-ependymal, renal, hepatic) remain largely unexplained, and the 
Applicant is requested to commit to a PASS addressing this. . 
The  observed  adverse  event  profile  is  considered  acceptable.  Therefore,  the  benefit  risk  balance  is 
positive.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Jivi is favourable in the following indication: 
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in previously treated patients ≥ 12 years of age with 
haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency). 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions:

INTRODUCTION 
The availability of the patch formulation will offer patients a reduced side-effect profile in comparison 
to  the  currently  approved  capsule  formulation  and  the  convenience  of  a  once  daily  application, 
together with proven efficacy. Compliance and ease of use of medications in patients with dementia, is 
considered a significant achievement in this population.

Long term stability and accelerated stability studies of 3 pilot batches covering storage periods up to 5 
years  and  stress  testing  under  different  conditions  were  obtained.  Photo-stability  study  has  been 
performed  with  one  pilot  batch.  Supportive  stability  data  have  been  obtained  with  2  pilot  batches.  
The  stability  studies  have  shown  that  rivastigmine  free  base  is  very  sensitive  to  oxidation,  moisture 
and light exposure. Degradation is accelerated by the influence of heat. The stability results showed 
that  storage  at  5°C  +  3°C  with  protection  from  light  and  with  protective  gas  is  recommended.  
The proposed retest period of 5 years is accepted.

Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The aim of transdermal administration was to improve the tolerability of the active substance and to 
avoid the first-pass and to deliver a sufficiently high concentration of the active substance to achieve 
and maintain a sufficiently high plasma concentration. 
The development of the patches was based on the intrinsic physico-chemical properties of the active 
substance, active substance concentration, physical properties of the matrix, etc. 
A bi-layer patch formulation with optimal  skin adhesion not affecting the transdermal drug delivery 
was  identified  and  selected  as  final  marketing  formulation.  This  formulation  was  used  in  a  clinical 
study  evaluating  the  skin  adhesive  properties,  pharmacokinetics,  local  skin  irritation,  safety  and 
tolerability. 
The  excipients  used  are    DL-α-tocopherol  (vitamin  E),  ethyl  acetate  and  silicone  oil  which  are 
described in the Ph.Eur and/or the USP., and silicone pressure sensitive adhesive (Bio PSA Q7-4302 
high-tack, amine resistant silicone adhesive), Durotak 387-2353 (acrylic pressure sensitive adhesive) 
and  poly(butylmethacrylate  methylmethacrylate)  which  are  no-compendial  but  are  commercially 
available products.  
The chosen backing film is made of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and the protective release liner 
made of fluoropolymer-coated PET film which are commercially available.  
Each patch is individually packaged in heat-sealed child resistant sachets made of a paper, polyester, 
aluminium,  polyacrylonitrile  (Barex)  multi-laminated  sachet  stock  to  assure  the  hygiene  as  well  as 
protection of the pharmaceutical product against light, air, and humidity. 
Manufacture of the Product 
The manufacturing process is typical of transdermal patches. The process comprises 4 steps.  
The  manufacturing  process  has  been  validated  by  a  number  of  studies  for  the  major  steps  of  the 
manufacturing process. The in process controls are adequate for this presentation. 
Three  full-scale  production  batches  data  show  that  the  patches  can  be  manufactured  reproducibly 
according to the agreed finished product specification, which is suitable for control of this transdermal 
preparation. 
Product Specification 
The product specifications include tests by validated methods for appearance, identification  (HPLC, 
TLC),  Peel  force,  Adhesion  force,  release  rate  (HPLC),  Impurities  (HPLC),  Microbial  limit, 
uniformity of content (HPLC), assay of rivastigmine (HPLC), and assay of D,L-α-tocopherol  (HPLC).  
Degradation products are controlled and their limits are justified by reference to stability studies and 
toxicology studies. 
The tests and limits of the specifications for the finished product are appropriate to control the quality 
of the finished product for their intended purpose. 
Batch analysis data confirm satisfactory uniformity of the product at release. 
Stability of the Product 
9  production  batches  covering  storage  periods  up  to  36  months  were  placed  on  stability  under  ICH 
conditions  (25°C/60%RH,  30°C/65%RH  and  40°C/75%RH)  .  In  view  of  the  use  of  the  products  in 
climate zones III and IV, storage at 30°C/65% RH and alternate 30°C/75% RH was chosen as the long 
term  storage  condition  for  stability  studies.  Bracketing  concept  was  applied    in  order  to  reduce  the 
number of samples to be tested. The bracketing concept is justified since all patch strengths have the 
identical percentage composition and since all patch strengths of each study are made from the same

master  laminate  roll.  The  batches  were  tested  for  appearance,  content  of  active  substance  and 
tocopherol, degradation products, in vitro release, adhesive and peel forces. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as stated in the SPC 
are acceptable. 
Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information  on  development,  manufacture  and  control  of  the  active  substance  and  finished  product 
have  been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the 
conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.

NON-CLINICAL ASPECTS 
Introduction 
The  active  substance  of  Prometax  is  an  enantiomeric  pure  compound.  ENA713  is  the  name  used 
throughout this report, however, SDZ 212-713; SDZ ENA 713; 212-713 are also names for the active 
substance  rivastigmine  used  in  the  non-clinical  documentation.  ENA713D  (rivastigmine  transdermal 
patch), SDZ ENA 713 TDS or Prometax Patch are names of the finished product that are used in the 
non-clinical  documentation.  ENA713D  contains  the  free  rivastigmine  base,  whereas  oral  Prometax 
contains the hydrogen tartrate salt.  
Pharmacology 
Rivastigmine is a slowly reversible (pseudo-irreversible) inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and 
butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) of the carbamate type which exerts its therapeutic effect by enhancing 
cholinergic  function.  Inhibitors  of  AChE  are  thought  to  facilitate  cholinergic  neurotransmission  by 
enhancing  the  concentrations  of  the  neurotransmitter  acetylcholine  and  its  action  in  the  cholinergic 
synapse. 
Safety pharmacology studies or pharmacodynamic drug-interaction studies using the dermal route of 
administration  have  not  been  conducted;  and  no  primary  and  secondary  pharmacodynamic  studies 
have  been  conducted  either  by  the  dermal  route  of  administration.  However,  the  Prometax  hard 
capsules  studies  have  demonstrated  that  rivastigmine  inhibits  both,  acetylcholinesterase  (AChE)  and 
butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), thereby exhibiting the desired pharmacological profile, i.e., dual and 
selective  inhibition  of  ChE  within  specific  regions  of  the  brain,  and  a  long  duration  of  action.  The 
pharmacodynamics effects of Prometax hard capsules are well established.

Pharmacokinetics 
The  pharmacokinetic  properties  of  rivastigmine  and  its  inactive  major  metabolite  NAP226-90  after 
administration of Prometax patch have been well characterised in adequate studies. 
Regarding  the  absorption, upon  dermal  doses,  the  Tmax  of  rivastigmine  of  18-24  hours  indicated  a 
slow release of rivastigmine from patch to the skin and/or slow dermal absorption. The AUC-ratio of 
the primary metabolite NAP226-90 to rivastigmine was 0.24 for the intravenous dose, as compared to 
about  200 
ratio  was  0.3-0.5.  
Data demonstrate the strong first-pass effect after oral administration and the virtual absence of first-
pass metabolism after dermal administration, explaining the better bioavailability from dermal patches 
than after oral administration.

for 
After  oral  administration  radioactive-labelled  product  to  rat  and  mouse,  the  distribution  of 
radioactivity  throughout  the  body  was  extensive,  without  retention  in  any  tissue.  Plasma  protein 
binding  was  low  (15,  19  and  43%  for  rat,  dog  and  human).  Radioactivity  was  associated  with  red 
blood cells (fraction 0.67, 0.53 and 0.43 for rat, dog and human). Levels in the placenta were greater 
than maternal blood levels at 1 h (Day 13 and 17) and 3 h (Day 17). Radioactivity was detected only at 
Day  17  in  foetal  liver.  The  transfer  of  radioactivity  into  milk  was  rapid.  The  overall  milk:plasma 
concentration ratio of radioactivity was 1.9, based on AUC0-∞. 
The  major  pathway  was  hydrolytic  decarbamoylation,  giving  the  major  metabolite  NAP226-90. 
Oxidative N-demethylation at the dimethylaminoethyl side chain was a minor pathway. Metabolism 
of  rivastigmine  in  plasma  is  mediated  by  BuChE.  However,  hydrolytic  metabolism  in  plasma 
contributes only to a small extent to the overall metabolism of rivastigmine in human. 
Concerning  the  excretion,  after  oral  administration  to  rat  and  mouse,  the  excretion  of  radioactivity 
was  mainly  with  urine  and  in  the  form  of  metabolites.  Based  on  previously  reported  data  on 
metabolism in rat, dog and human, the large majority of the drug-related material in urine was in the 
form of hydrophilic metabolites e.g. glucuronic acid and sulfate conjugates. 
In the radiolabeled ADME/pharmacokinetics study in minipigs, following dermal dosing, the mass 
balance of radioactivity amounted to 77–86 % of the dose, with 62–70% recovered in the patch, and 
1.7-4.1%  at  the  application  site.  The  recovery in urine  and  faeces  amounted  to  14.2-17.8%  and  0.4-
0.5% of the doses after a 24-hour patch application to abraded skin. 
The results of toxicokinetics studies showed that approximately 50% of the dose was absorbed from 
the patch, and the actual administered doses were approximately 50% of the nominal doses. Exposure 
of the test species was dose-related if not dose-proportional, and proportional to the patch area. There 
was no obvious gender difference. 
Toxicology 
No  topical  single  dose  toxicity  studies  have  been  carried  out  with  ENA713D  (rivastigmine  trans-
dermal patch), however single dose toxicity studies with rivastigmine tartrate had been carried out in 
mice  (oral  and  intravenous  route),  rats  (oral  and  intraperitoneal  route),  which  found  no  unexpected 
toxicities.   
Regarding  the  repeat-dose  dermal  toxicity  studies,  in  the  preliminary  toxicity  studies  in  mice,  no 
treatment-related changes in the skin were observed. In 13-week dermal toxicity, no treatment-related 
histopathological  effect  was  observed.  The  no-toxic-effect  level  (NTEL)  was  set  at  0.4  mg/kg/day.  
In  percutaneous  toxicity  study,  treatment  of  rats  with  ENA713D  for  4  weeks  was  associated  with 
exaggerated pharmacological effects. The no-toxic effect level of ENA713D was set at 15 mg/kg for 
males, and 5 mg/kg for females, respectively.

In a 4-week dermal tolerability study in minipigs, a dose-related reduction in butyryl cholinesterase 
activity  was  seen  in  males  but  not  females.  The  NTEL  for  systemic  toxicity  was  set  at  72 
mg/animal/day.  In  a  26-week  dermal  study,  exposure  of  minipig  to  ENA713D  trans-dermal  patches 
for  23  hours  per  day  for  26  weeks  caused  no  signs  of  toxicity.  Acute  epidermal  inflammation  of 
comparable  severity  occurred  primarily  in  minipigs  at  multiple  sites  such  as  application  site,  tape-
treated  and  untreated  sites.  Correlated  microscopic  findings  consisted  of  spongiosis,  perivascular 
inflammation  and  parakeratosis  with  encrustation.  In  the  superficial  dermis,  there  was  perivascular 
accumulation  of  lymphocytes  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  eosinophils.  There  was  no  tissue  necrosis, 
sclerosis,  or  vascular  damage.  However,  the  patch  formulation  or  application  itself  induces 
inflammation.  This  conclusion  is  supported  by  the  observation  that  increased  rotation  of  patch 
application  sites  reduced  inflammation  and  that  there  was  no  dose-relationship  for  dermatitis  in 
minipigs.  Regarding  the  weak  dermal  tolerance  of  the  patch  in  the  minipig,  clinical  observations 
should be considered as a priority. 
No  additional  genotoxicity  tests  were  carried  out  for  the  ENA713D  trans-dermal  patch  since  a 
complete  genotoxicity  package  had  been  conducted  with  rivastigmine  tartrate  showing  that 
rivastigmine is devoid of mutagenic potential. 
Concerning  the  carcinogenicity  aspects,  no  ENA713D-related  neoplastic  or  non-neoplastic  lesions 
were detected in the topical study performed in mice with rivastigmine. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies by the dermal route were not carried out because a 
complete package had been conducted in rats and rabbits with rivastigmine tartrate using the oral route 
of administration. These studies conducted with rivastigmine tartrate gave no evidence of a teratogenic 
potential  for  rivastigmine.  Nevertheless  a  slightly  prolonged  duration  of  gestation  in  post-  and 
perinatal studies in rats was consistently recorded (although considered too small to be of biological 
relevance) and may be a sequel to cholinergic stimulation. 
Juvenile toxicity studies were not conducted with trans-dermal system using rivastigmine. 
Local tolerance studies have been carried out with ENA713D by dermal application of patches and 
topical or intradermal administration of solutions to rabbits and guinea pigs. ENA713D is considered a 
weak but reversible ocular irritant in rabbits. Skin irritation studies in rabbits indicate that ENA713D 
transdermal  patch  is  considered  as  non-irritant  to  the  skin  of  rabbits.  Sensitization  studies  with 
ENA713D  trans-dermal  patch  conducted  in  guinea  pigs  using  the  modified  Buehler  method  and 
maximization  test  showed  that  ENA713D  transdermal  patch  was  considered  to  be  a  non-sensitizer. 
ENA713D  transdermal  patches  or  placebo  patches  indicating  that  ENA713D  trans-dermal  patches 
were not capable of eliciting a phototoxic response in the guinea pig. 
Regarding  the  excipients,  no  novel  excipients  are  used  for  the  ENA713D  transdermal  patches.  
The  drug  product  matrix  of  the  Prometax  patch  consists  of  a  mixture  of  acrylate  and  methacrylate 
polymers  which  have  also  been  used  in  other  trans-dermal  systems.  The  local  tolerability  of  these 
substances is well known. In addition, different formulations have been used which contained varying 
amounts and/or different excipients. In most cases, the local tolerance studies showed that ENA713D 
transdermal patch compositions were considered as “not irritating” and not to be a sensitizer. 
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The  MAH  performed  an  Environmental  Risk  Assessment 
in  accordance  with  guideline 
EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00.  Rivastigmine  was  found  not  to  be  readily  biodegraded  and  not 
bioaccumulative.  Acute  toxicity  was  studied  in  the  base-set  of  aquatic  organisms.  Potential 
environmental risks were identified for surface water and groundwater using literature ecotoxicity data 
of 
rivastigmine.  
The  risk  for  microorganism  was  evaluated,  and  concluded  by  the  MAH  to  be  unlikely,  using  MIC-
results for soil micro-organisms.

The  CHMP  concluded  that  the  adequacy  of  the  obtained  risk  quotients  and  identified  possible 
environmental risk potential cannot be assessed at this stage due to limited data. Therefore, the MAH 
was asked to complete the ERA with several tests, including chronic ecotoxicity, toxicity to a sludge 
microbial community, and sludge and sediment partitioning tests.  
In Phase I the Fpen can be refined if there are reasonable epidemiologic data showing that less than the 
default  1  %  of  the  EU  population  is  suffering  from  the  indication.  In  Phase  II,  Tier  A  this 
epidemiological  based  PECsurfacewater  is  used  in  the  PEC/PNEC  calculation.  If  still  necessary,  human 
metabolism, environmental fate data, and STP modelling is acceptable for refining the PEC in Tier B. 
The CHMP considered the use of unsupported sales data forecast questionable and the use of patent 
expiry and projected patient share based sales data was not accepted.  
The MAH committed to provide the studies asked for and a revised ERA is awaited for June 2008. If 
the revised ERA indicates a need for Tier B assessment the PEC should be re-calculated accordingly.

CLINICAL ASPECTS 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP, as claimed by the MAH. The MAH has 
provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out 
in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.   
Pharmacokinetics 
Due  to  its  high  lipophilicity  and  relatively  low  molecular  weight,  rivastigmine  exhibits  an  adequate 
profile for administration by trans-dermal route. 
Biopharmaceutical and pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that rivastigmine is well released 
from  the  patch  and  that  the  released  amounts  remain  steady.  The  overall  systemic  exposure  is 
substantially higher with the patch than with oral solution and the plasma concentrations fluctuation is 
reduced with the patch. Lower inter-individual variability is also observed with the patch compared to 
the oral formulations. 
There  is  no  available  data  to  allow  a  valid  estimation  of  the  intra-individual  variability  of  PK 
parameters  of  rivastigmine.  Nevertheless,  the  assimilation  of  the  residuals  from  the  mixed  effect 
models to the intra-subject variability are considered an acceptable approximation. In order to reduce 
the  variability  inherent  to  the  site  of  application,  only  three  application  sites  showing  homogeneous 
bioavailability profiles are recommended for application in the SPC. Rivastigmine release through the 
skin is reduced by 20-30 % when the patch is applied to the thigh or the abdomen comparatively to 
upper  back,  chest  or  upper-arm.  The  SPC  recommends  therefore,  application  on  the  upper  or  lower 
back, upper arm or chest, which is considered acceptable. 
No specific metabolic pathway was observed with the trans-dermal route and no metabolism shift was 
identified. The metabolism profile is comparable to that observed with the I.V. route. 
No gender effect was evidenced. Thus no dosage adjustment in females as compared male patients is 
to be considered. 
Pharmacokinetic  behaviour  of  rivastigmine  patches  is  almost  similar  in  Caucasians  and  Japanese 
individuals. No reliable data are available in blacks and other ethnic groups. However considering the 
very  good  absorption  level  of  rivastigmine  through  the  skin,  the  difference  in  PK  behaviour  due  to 
ethnicity is unlikely.

It appears that systemic exposure to rivastigmine is inversely related to bodyweight. The findings of 
this analysis are reflected in the SPC. 
There is no reliable estimation of the PK behaviour of rivastigmine in elderly patients (specially older 
than  75  years).  However,  the  potential  difference  in  PK  behaviour  in  the  elderly  is  related  to  the 
reduced renal and liver function in this patient group, and no dosage adjustment is required in renal 
and hepatic impaired patients using rivastigmine. 
The  overall  pharmacokinetic  data  presented  by  the  MAH  was  considered  appropriate  to  support  the 
SPC recommendations regarding the switch from oral to transdermal dosing. 
Pharmacodynamics 
Rivastigmine  has  a  slowly  reversible  mechanism  of  acetylcholinesterase  and  butyrylcholinesterase 
inhibition that induces an increase in the concentration of acetylcholine. 
The  extent  of  inhibition  of  plasma  butyrylcholinesterase  (BuChE)  was  evaluated  in  3  clinical 
pharmacology  studies:  Study 2335,  Study 1101,  Study 2331  and  in  one  Phase  II  study  in  Japanese 
patients with AD: Study 1201 (trough values only). 
Plasma  BuChE  inhibition  data  appears  fairly  consistent,  demonstrating  under-proportional  dose-
dependency,  with  maximum  observed  inhibition  approaching  70%  with  the  20  cm2  patch  at  steady 
state.  Inhibition  appears  slightly  higher  in  Japanese  than  in  Caucasian  subjects,  and  slightly  higher 
with multiple than with single dosing.  Peak inhibition at each of the four patch dose levels (5, 10, 15 
and 20 cm2) is about the same as at the four oral doses, but trough and average (over time) inhibition is 
higher  with  the  trans-dermal  route  BuChE  inhibition  at  steady  state  appeared  higher  in  Japanese 
patients  than  in  Japanese  healthy  volunteers,  but  it  needs  to  be  borne  in  mind  that  also  plasma 
concentrations of rivastigmine were higher in those patients. 
The oral b.i.d. rivastigmine administration resulted in two peaks of plasma BuChE inhibition in each 
24-hour period, similarly to what was observed in rivastigmine plasma concentrations. Fluctuations of 
BuChE  inhibition  between  peaks  and  troughs  were  much  wider  than  with  trans-dermal  route  of 
administration.   
Exposure (PK)–response (PD) relationships were investigated using data from Study CENA713D2331 
and  the  pivotal  clinical  trial  CENA713D0401,  both  conducted  in  the  target  population  (Alzheimer 
Disease, AD) following multiple doses of rivastigmine patch and oral capsule. 
There  was  a  direct  exposure-response  (PK/PD)  relationship  between  the  rivastigmine  metabolite 
NAP226-90 and  plasma  BuChE  inhibition.  There  was  a  trend  for  increased  efficacy  with  increasing 
drug exposure. This was observed for the change from baseline in ADAS-Cog score and for ADAS-
CGIC response rate. No such trends could be seen for ADCS-ADL or NPI scores. 
Although  no  direct  PK/PD  relationship  between  rivastigmine  or  NAP226-90  plasma  concentrations 
and adverse events (AEs) was seen with the available data, there were indications that the frequency of 
the AEs increased with increasing doses, especially the risk of nausea and vomiting.

Uncontrolled trials 
Dose  selection  was  based  on  the  phase  II  safety  and  tolerability  data  (including  study 
CENA713D0401) and preliminary pharmacokinetic modeling data.  
The  pivotal  study  CENA713D2320  (placebo  and  active-controlled)  was  conducted  in  1195  patients 
with Alzheimer’s disease to support the efficacy claims of the patch in the target indication “mild to 
moderately severe Alzheimer’s disease”.  
The  design  of  study  CENA713D2320  (24-week  prospective,  randomized,  multicenter,  double-blind, 
placebo-controlled,  parallel-group)  and  the  methodology  of  the  study  was  in  line  with  the  CHMP’s 
Scientific Advice of 18 October 2002. 
The  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  ensured  recruitment  of  consistent  population  representative  of 
AD. Other dementia types were excluded. The selection of the primary (ADAS-cog and ADCS-CGIC) 
and  secondary  efficacy  measures  were  considered  acceptable  to  explore  the  severity  of  cognitive 
functions  (memory,  language  and  praxis),  attention,  activities  of  daily  living  and  non-cognitive 
behavioural dysfunctions characteristic of people with dementia.  
A total of 1464 patients were screened, of whom 1195 were randomized in 21 countries. Mean MMSE 
at baseline was 16.5, which is representative of a moderate disease state and is reflected in the high 
proportion (86.1%) of patients living with a caregiver or other individual. 
Two different Prometax target patch sizes (10 and 20 cm2) were evaluated. Prometax 20 cm2 patch is 
equivalent to a capsule dose of approximately 18 mg/day. The 10 cm2 daily patch is equivalent to a 
capsule  dose  of  approximately  9.5 mg/day  (within  the  recommended  6-12 mg/day  dose  range  for 
Prometax capsules).  
Prometax 5 cm2 patch is equivalent to a capsule dose of approximately 5 mg/day and Prometax 15 cm2 
patch to 13 mg/day were use in the titration phase.  
The  initial  patch  dose  was  Prometax  patch  5  cm2  and  was  up-titrated  in  5  cm2  increments  at  a 
minimum interval of 4 weeks up to the target patch dose. 
The doses were titrated over a 16 week period, followed by an 8 week maintenance period. 
The primary efficacy criteria assessments were: 
• 
the  Alzheimer’s  Disease  Assessment  Scale-Cognitive  subscale  (ADAS-Cog):  The  analysis 
variable was the change from baseline to Week 24 in the total sum score (0-70) of the 11items 
included in the scale. 
the  Alzheimer’s  Disease  Cooperative  Study-Clinician’s  Global  Impression  of  Change  (ADCS-
CGIC): The analysis variable was the overall clinical rating of change from baseline to Week 24 
measured by a 7-point scale. 
• 
Clinically relevant improvement was defined a priori as at least 4-point improvement on the ADAS-
Cog, no worsening on the ADCS-CGIC, and no worsening on the ADCS-ADL. 
The primary objectives of the study were assessed by testing four hypotheses, prospectively ordered 
according to clinical relevance. A hierarchical testing procedure was selected.

The first hypothesis was composed of two comparisons (ADAS-Cog and ADCS-CGIC) between the 
20 cm2  rivastigmine patch and placebo treatment groups. In order to demonstrate superiority of the 20 
cm2  rivastigmine  patch  over  placebo,  superiority  needed  to  be  shown  for  both  primary  efficacy 
variables simultaneously,  
The  second  hypothesis  (non-inferiority)  compared  the  20  cm2  rivastigmine  patch  and  rivastigmine 
capsule treatment groups for the ADAS-Cog variable, in order to demonstrate non-inferiority of the 20 
cm2 rivastigmine patch to rivastigmine capsules. 
The third hypothesis was composed of two comparisons (for ADAS-Cog and ADCS-CGIC) between 
the 10 cm2 rivastigmine patch and placebo treatment groups. In order to demonstrate the superiority of 
the 10 cm2 rivastigmine patch over placebo, superiority needed to be shown for both primary efficacy 
variables simultaneously. 
The  fourth  hypothesis  compared  ADCS-ADL  between  the  20  cm2  rivastigmine  patch  and  placebo 
treatment groups. 
Statistical  superiority of  the  target  Prometax  20 cm2  patch  versus  placebo  at Week  24  was  based  on 
simultaneous testing of ADAS-Cog and ADCS-CGIC. Superiority was demonstrated for ADAS-Cog 
(p < 0.001). The p-value (0.054) for ADCS-CGIC exceeded the predefined significance level of 0.05. 
Nevertheless,  supportive  analyses  for  ADCS-CGIC  at  Week  24  have  shown  statistically  significant 
results  across  all  other  pre-specified  efficacy  population  datasets  (ITT+RDO and  RND)  with 
respective p-values of 0.034 and 0.029.  
Although  the  first  objective  was  not  formally  achieved  as  planned,  testing  was  continued  for  the 
remaining three hypotheses. This was considered acceptable. 
Non-inferiority of the Prometax 20 cm2 patch over capsules (12 mg/day) at Week 24 was established 
as the 95%-CI was below non-inferiority margin of 1.25 based only on ADAS-Cog (-2.06; 0.17). 
For  Prometax  10 cm2  patch,  statistical  superiority  versus  placebo  at  Week  24  was  demonstrated  by 
simultaneous testing of ADAS-Cog and ADCS-CGIC, with respective p-values of 0.005 and 0.010. 
Superiority  of  Prometax  20 cm2  patch  versus  placebo  at  Week  24  with  regard  to  ADCS-ADL  was 
achieved with a p-value of 0.017. 
An  overall  responder  analysis  was  conducted  based  on  patients  with  ADAS-Cog  improvement  of  at 
least  4  points  and  ADCS-CGIC  categories  1-4  (any  improvement  or  no  change)  and  ADCS-ADL 
change ≥ 0 points (no change or improvement). The analysis showed that at Week 24, a statistically 
significant  greater  proportion  of  patients  responded  to  Prometax  patch  10  cm2  or  20  cm2  or  capsule 
treatment than to placebo.  
Overall it can be concluded that both the Prometax 10 cm2 and 20 cm2 patch sizes showed efficacy vs 
placebo in the domains of cognition (measured by ADAS-Cog), clinical global assessment of change 
(measured by ADCS-CGIC) and function (measured by ADCS-ADL). The p-value for ADCS-CGIC 
marginally exceeded the predefined significance level of 0.05, by 0.004. However, supportive analyses 
for  ADCS-CGIC  at  week  24  yielded  consistent  and  statistically  significant  results  across  all  other 
prespecified efficacy population datasets (ITT, ITT+RDO and RND with their respective imputation 
schemes) as well as for the predefined proportional odds model. 
Secondary  efficacy  criteria  showed  that  Prometax  patch  groups  and  the  Prometax  capsule  group 
were superior to placebo for the MMSE score, the Ten Point Clock Test score and the Trail Making 
Test Part A. There were no significant differences versus placebo on the NPI-10 or NPI-12 for any of 
the Prometax treatment groups. For caregiver distress scores, there was a  similar improvement from 
baseline in Prometax patch groups, the Prometax capsule group and the placebo group.  
Supportive  data  were  provided  from  the  open-label  extension  phase  of  the  pivotal  study  which  is 
completed  (study  CENA713D2320E1)  and  an  uncontrolled  study  in  AD  patients.  Patients  who 
received open-label treatment and had previously been randomized to double-blind Prometax 20 cm2 
patch  treatment  maintained  their  baseline  (Week  0)  levels  at  the  end  of  52  week  treatment  and 
achieved better scores in the efficacy assessments at 52 weeks compared to those received Prometax 
10 cm2 patch, capsule or placebo. No conclusion can be drawn taking into account the methodology of 
these studies. 
The  uncontrolled  study  CENA713D1201  in  Japanese  patients  was  a  multicenter,  open-label, 
randomized  study  that  assessed  in  parallel  groups  a  4-week  titration  intervals  of  increasing  sizes  of 
Prometax transdermal patch to assess safety and tolerability in Japanese patients with mild to moderate

AD. Prometax patch was well tolerated at patch sizes up to 10 cm2 in Japanese patients with mild to 
moderate AD, with improved tolerability when there were additional titration steps. 
Overall it can be concluded that Prometax 20 cm2 patch showed superiority versus placebo. 
Prometax 15 cm2 patch may provide additional efficacy benefits over Prometax 10 cm2. However, the 
clinical  program  for  the  Prometax  transdermal  patch  was  not  designed  to  answer  this  question. 
Without additional data, the sponsor is unable to provide sufficient information on the relative efficacy 
profile of this dose. 
Prometax  10 cm2  patch  demonstrated  statistical  superiority  versus  placebo  at  Week  24  by 
simultaneous  testing  of  ADAS-Cog  and  ADCS-CGIC.  Non-inferiority  of  Prometax  10  cm2  versus 
Prometax capsule was explored by a pre-planned analysis documented in the statistical analysis plan 
prior to unblinding and not included in the primary hypotheses. The CHMP considered these results 
acceptable for the claimed indication. 
Prometax 5 cm2 patch was considered acceptable as the initial treatment dose. After a minimum of four 
weeks of treatment and if well tolerated, this dose should be increased to the 10 cm2 patch, which is the 
recommended effective dose. 
The efficacy and safety of rivastigmine patches in patients with Parkinson Disease Dementia (PDD) 
have  not  been  investigated  in  a  clinical  study.  The CHMP  concluded  that  with  the  current  available 
data, the safety and efficacy could not be extrapolated to the PDD indication and the MAH agreed that 
the safety and tolerability should also be demonstrated in this population.

* One patient in Study 1201 commenced treatment but was lost to follow-up and did not return for any evaluations. As a 
result, the patient was excluded from the safety population. 
The primary groups mainly used for the evaluation of safety are Group1 (all Prometax patch, capsule 
and placebo treated AD patients in double-blind controlled studies) and Group2 (all Prometax patch 
treated patients in Study 2320 and it is open-label long term extension).  
In  Group1,  approximately  60%  of  patients  received  treatment  for  the  full  24  week  period.  In  this 
group, for the available evaluations of patch adhesion, more than 94% of all patches remained either 
completely on or were only detached at the edges. 
In Group2, including long-term safety data, 23,1% of patients received Prometax patch treatment for 
at least 52 weeks.

In Group3 (all Prometax patch treated AD patients in studies 2320, 2320E1, 0401, 1201 and 2331), the 
mean duration of exposure was 28.7 weeks. In the healthy volunteer studies (Group4), a total of 432 
subjects were exposed to Prometax patch for a maximum of 3 weeks. 
Overall, these data do not highlight new or unexpected adverse events, in association with Prometax 
patch administration, which were not already known for Prometax capsule. 
A  dose  response  relationship  is  suggested,  based  on  the  difference  between  the  incidence  of  AEs  in 
patients  in  the  higher  and  lower  patch  size  groups,  for  gastrointestinal  AEs  (nausea,  vomiting, 
diarrhea,  decreased  weight,  decreased  appetite,  anorexia),  for  asthenia,  and  for  nervous  system  AEs 
(dizziness, insomnia, agitation). 
The  20  cm2  patch  was  overall  associated  with  a  higher  incidence  of  adverse  events  compared  to 
Prometax  12  mg  capsule.  In  particular,  gastrointestinal  disorders  (such  as  diarrhea,  vomiting, 
abdominal  pain),  and  other  disorders  such  as  decreased  appetite,  weight  decreased,  insomnia  and 
anxiety,  were  more  frequently  observed  in  the  20  cm2  patch  group  compared  to  Prometax  12  mg 
capsule.  These  data  constitute  an  area  of  concern  regarding  the  safety  profile  of  the  20  cm2  patch 
formulation.  
Prometax 20 cm2 patch group was associated with more cardiac disorders than other treatment groups. 
However, ECG evaluations at baseline revealed more arrhythmic abnormalities in patients randomized 
to  the  Prometax  20  cm2  patch  group  (8.2%  vs  4.6-5.6%  in  other  groups).  Baseline  myocardial 
abnormalities  were  more  common  in  the  Prometax  20  cm2  patch  and  the  Prometax  capsule  groups 
which might explain the higher rate of cardiac disorders in the Prometax 20 cm2 patch group. 
The  incidence  of  serious  adverse  events  in  Group1  was  highest  in  the  Prometax  20  cm2  patch  size 
group compared to the other groups. The most frequently reported  serious AEs were in the nervous 
system, cardiac and gastrointestinal system organ classes for the 10 cm2 and 20 cm2 Prometax patch 
and Prometax capsule groups.  
In  Group1,  the  10  cm2  patch  is  better  tolerated  than  the  Prometax  capsule  (except  for  diarrhea, 
abdominal pain and anxiety, which were slightly more frequent in the 10 cm2 patch group) and than 
the  20  cm2  patch  (particularly  regarding  nausea,  vomiting,  decreased  weight,  decreased 
appetite,anorexia, dizziness, insomnia). 
Regarding  Prometax  5  cm2  patch  size,  data  are  insufficient  for  an  accurate  evaluation  of  adverse 
events for this dose, since patients were not randomized to this patch size in the main study 2320.  The 
data  provided  are  reassuring  regarding  the  low  number  of  patients  who  experienced  severe  skin 
irritation (0.76%) with the 5 cm2 and 10 cm2 patch sizes.  
Discontinuations due to gastrointestinal disorders were higher in the Prometax 20 cm2 patch group and 
Prometax capsule group than in the Prometax 10 cm2 patch or placebo groups. These data support the 
improvement  of  the  rivastigmine  tolerability  with  Prometax  10  cm2  patch  regarding  gastrointestinal 
events.   
Since Prometax 5 cm2 patch size is expected to be given mainly at initiation and during the titration 
period, appropriated data on adverse events with this patch were provided as compared with 1.5 mg 
b.i.d. The overall incidence of AEs, SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation in patients treated with 
Prometax 5 cm2 patch and Prometax 1.5 mg b.i.d capsule (corresponding to a comparable exposure) 
were similar for the first 4 weeks of treatment. The most common AEs in the Prometax patch group 
were  nausea,  diarrhoea  and  dizziness.  Nausea  and  vomiting  incidences  were  both  lower  in  patients 
treated by Prometax patch than in patients treated by Prometax capsule. The incidences of headaches, 
decreased weight and decreased appetite were lower in the Prometax patch group than in the Prometax 
capsule group. 
In patients treated with a maximum Prometax 1.5 mg b.i.d. capsule, the incidence of AEs was higher 
than in patients treated with a maximum Prometax patch of 5 cm2.

Thus, although initiation of treatment with the Prometax 5 cm2 patch results in exposure (on the basis 
of  AUC)  that  is  substantially  greater  than  for  Prometax  1.5  mg  b.i.d.  capsule,  it  appears  to  have 
comparable safety and improved gastrointestinal tolerability over the Prometax 1.5 mg b.i.d capsule. 
Therefore, the Prometax 5 cm2 patch is a suitable initiation dose. 
Regarding  extrapyramidal  symptoms,  1,4%  are  reported  with  the  10  cm2  Prometax  patch  (including 
one serious case), compared to 0% with higher doses of patch groups. The four cases reported with 10 
cm2  Prometax  patch  do  not  allow  concluding  to  a  higher  risk  of  adverse  events  related  to 
extrapyramidal  system,  despite  the  higher  incidence  with  this  patch  dose  in  study  2320.  However, 
extrapyramidal symptoms may occur with rivastigmine, as reported in the SPC of Prometax capsules.  
A total of 27 patients who received study treatment (Prometax patch, capsule and placebo) died during 
the  clinical  development  program.  According  to  the  data  provided,  no  signal  raised  from  the  death 
cases  reported  in  the  Prometax  patch  groups,  compared  to  other  treatment  groups.  In  all  cases, 
patient’s  history  could  have  explained  the  fatal  event.  Moreover,  cardiac  failure,  cerebrovascular 
accident, respiratory failure are common causes of death in the general elderly population. 
Skin  reactions  are  expected  side-effects  associated  with  the  use  of  patch.  Patients  treated  with 
Prometax  patches  experienced  more  frequently  slight  or  mild  skin  irritation,  compared  to  placebo 
patches (33.3% vs 27.6% for the 20 cm2 patch, 29.9% vs 17.3% for the 15 cm2 patch, 38.2% vs 22.3% 
for the 10 cm2 patch, 21.4% vs 11.8% for the 5 cm2 patch). 
The  majority  of  skin  reactions  were  very  slight  or  mild  erythema  or  pruritus.  The  skin  irritation 
appears  to  be  due  to  mechanical  stress  caused  by  adhesion  and  removal  of  the  patches,  and  is 
exacerbated  by  rivastigmine  which  acts  as  an  additional  chemical  irritant.  Allergic  dermatitis  or 
sensitization do not seem to be the cause of application site reaction, however the number of patients 
who received Prometax capsules after study discontinuation  due to application site dermatitis is very 
low, and then it is difficult to draw any definitive conclusion. 
No  patient  in  any  of  the  Prometax  patch  studies  experienced  a  skin  reaction  that  was  reported  as  a 
serious adverse event, and 19 patients discontinued due to skin irritation in study 2320. Non serious 
skin reactions were collected and even solicited and were common. 
Site skin irritation data, assessed by the investigator for patients who completed 52 weeks of Prometax 
patch  treatment,  and  based  on  the  ratings  scale,  show  that  in  these  patients  there  was  no  apparent 
increase in the overall incidence or severity of skin irritation over the 52-week period. 
Safety  data  observed  in  Groups  2,  3  and  4  are  consistent  with  the  results  from  the  double-blind, 
controlled study population (Group1). 
No specific data related to immunological events are available for Prometax patches. 
No specific safety interaction studies have been conducted with Prometax patches. 
No  data  comparing  compliance  of  Prometax  patches  and  capsules  have  been  provided.  However,  to 
further assess Prometax patch compliance, adhesion and the risks of application site skin reactions and 
irritations in the long term daily use of the Prometax patch, Novartis will conduct a drug utilization 
study after the patch launch. It is expected that the drug utilization study will provide information on 
the practicalities of the Prometax patches in the real conditions of use. 
In conclusion the CHMP agreed on the following: 
• 
• 
• 
the safety profile of Prometax patch 5 cm2 and 10 cm2 was considered acceptable  
the safety profile and benefit/risk of Prometax 20cm2 patch was considered negative due to a high 
incidence of adverse effects, even if efficacy had been demonstrated  
the safety and benefit/risk of the 15 cm2 should be further justified 
The MAH agreed that Prometax 15 cm2 patch may provide additional efficacy benefits over Prometax  
10  cm2  patch  with  fewer  tolerability  concerns  than  those  associated  with  Prometax  20  cm2  patch. 
However,  the  clinical  program  for  the  Prometax  transdermal  patch  was  not  designed  to  answer  this 
question.  Without  additional  data,  the  MAH  was  unable  to  provide  sufficient  information  on  the

relative  efficacy,  tolerability  and  safety  profile  of  the  Prometax  15  cm2  patch  size  to  the  CHMP. 
Therefore  the  MAH  will  continue  to  evaluate  the  15  and  20  cm2  Prometax  patch  sizes  to  confirm  a 
favourable benefit/risk profile of these strengths.

RECOMMENDATION 
Quality 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology 
No  studies  on  the  pharmacodynamic  action  of  rivastigmine  were  included  in  the  dossier  as 
rivastigmine  is  considered  a  well  known  inhibitor  of  AChE  and  BChE.  The  non-clinical 
pharmacokinetic  and  toxicology  development  program  to  support  the  patch  formulation  was 
considered adequate. 
Efficacy 
Prometax 5 cm2 patch was considered acceptable as the initial treatment dose. 
Prometax 10 cm2 patch showed statistical superiority versus placebo at Week 24 as demonstrated by 
simultaneous testing of ADAS-Cog and ADCS-CGIC, with respective p-values of 0.005 and 0.010. 
An overall responder analysis based on patients with ADAS-Cog improvement of at least 4 points and 
ADCS-CGIC categories 1-4 (any improvement or no change) and ADCS-ADL change ≥ 0 points (no 
change  or  improvement)  showed  that  at  Week  24,  a  statistically  significant  greater  proportion  of 
patients responded to Prometax patch 10 cm2 than to placebo.  
Thus, efficacy of Prometax patch 5 cm2 and 10 cm2 was considered acceptable.

Safety 
All the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing experience have been included 
in the Summary of Product Characteristics 
Overall, these data do not highlight new or unexpected adverse events, in association with Prometax 
patch administration, which were not already known for Prometax capsule. 
The 20 cm2 patch was overall associated with a higher incidence of adverse effects compared to the 
equivalent  Prometax  12  mg  capsule.  In  particular,  gastrointestinal  disorders  (such  as  diarrhea, 
vomiting, abdominal pain), and other disorders such as decreased appetite, weight decreased, insomnia 
and  anxiety,  were  more  frequently  observed.  Discontinuation  due  to  gastrointestinal  disorders  was 
higher in the Prometax 20 cm2 patch and Prometax capsules groups. The safety profile of the 20 cm2 
patch formulation constituted an area of concern for the CHMP and the MAH agreed to continue to 
evaluate  the  safety  of  this  dose  before  a  new  application  for  its  approval  can  be  re-submitted.  The 
safety profile of the 15 cm2 patch needs to be further addressed. 
The 10 cm2  patch is better tolerated than the Prometax capsule (except for diarrhea, abdominal pain 
and  anxiety,  which  were  more  frequent  in  the  10  cm2  patch  group)  and  than  the  20  cm2  patch 
(particularly regarding nausea, vomiting, decreased weight, anorexia, dizziness).  
Skin  reactions  are  expected  side-effects  associated  with  the  use  of  patch.  Patients  treated  with 
Prometax  patches  experienced  more  frequently  slight  or  mild  skin  irritation,  compared  to  placebo 
group. 
The safety of Prometax 5 cm2 patch was considered acceptable as the initial treatment dose. 
The MAH agreed that Prometax 15 cm2 patch may provide additional efficacy benefits over Prometax  
10  cm2  patch  with  fewer  tolerability  concerns  than  those  associated  with  Prometax  20  cm2  patch. 
However,  the  clinical  program  for  the  Prometax  transdermal  patch  was  not  designed  to  answer  this 
question.  Without  additional  data,  the  MAH  was  unable  to  provide  sufficient  information  on  the 
relative efficacy, tolerability and safety profile of the Prometax 15 cm2 patch size to the CHMP. 
Having  considered  the  safety  concerns  in  the  risk  management  plan,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the 
proposed activities described in section 5 adequately addressed these concerns.  
Risk-benefit assessment 
The  efficacy  and  safety  of  rivastigmine  patches  has  been  investigated  in  patients  with  AD  in  one 
pivotal study. Supportive data were provided from 3 further uncontrolled studies in AD patients and 9 
studies in healthy volunteers.  
Considering  the  physicochemical  (relatively  low  molecular  weight,  lipophilicity  and  lack  of 
polymorphic  forms)  and  pharmacokinetic  (hepatic  first-pass  metabolism  generating  inactive 
metabolite) properties of rivastigmine, the claimed use of this drug by trans-dermal route appears to be 
potentially a suitable alternative to the current oral route. 
Prometax  transdermal  patches,  with  once-a-day  dosing  and  without  the  need  for  oral  administration 
with food, might offer the advantage of improved caregiver and patient convenience which may lead 
to  improved  patient  compliance.  In  addition  this  formulation  might  be  useful  for  patients  with 
swallowing difficulties who are unable or refuse to take oral medication. Nevertheless, available data 
from clinical studies on this specific topic should be provided with the comparison between Prometax 
patch and capsules. This will be addressed in the phase IV and drug utilization study that the MAH is 
planing.  
The  superiority  of  Prometax  10  cm2  patch  versus  placebo  has  been  demonstrated  and  there  are  no 
findings  as  regards  safety  as  compared  to  Prometax  12  mg  capsules.  The  overall  benefit/risk  of

Prometax patches 5 cm2 and 10 cm2 is positive for the “symptomatic treatment of mild to moderately 
severe Alzheimer’s dementia”. 
A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the 
opinion that:  
•  no  additional  risk  minimisation  activities  were  required  beyond  those  included  in  the  product 
information.

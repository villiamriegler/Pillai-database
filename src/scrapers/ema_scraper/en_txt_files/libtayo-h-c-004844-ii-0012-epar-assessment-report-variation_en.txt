2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction  
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
The proposed indication for cemiplimab is as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with locally 
advanced basal cell carcinoma (BCC) previously treated with a hedgehog pathway inhibitor (HHI).  
Epidemiology and risk factors 
Keratinocyte carcinomas are the most common cancers worldwide, and BCC represents approximately 
80% of keratinocyte carcinomas. There is a strong inverse relationship between the incidence of BCC and 
country geographic latitude combined with pigment status, with the highest rates in Australia followed by 
the United States and Europe. Precise incidence rates are not known because these carcinomas are 
generally not included in cancer registries. The total annual incidence of individuals diagnosed with BCC in 
the US has been estimated to be 2 million, and incidence appears to be increasing. In European 
countries, incidence rates for BCC are also reported to be increasing. 
The most common risk factors for BCC are chronic ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure, advanced age, 
male gender, and light skin pigmentation. Consistent with the predominance of UV expose as a risk 
factor, most BCCs arise in sun-exposed skin of the head and neck. Solid organ transplant recipients also 
have an approximately 6-to 16-fold increased risk of BCC compared to the general population. The 
reported median age of onset of BCC at diagnosis is 67 years. The risk is also increased in patients 
treated with chronic immunosuppression for autoimmune diseases. These findings are consistent with the 
hypothesis that these cancers are normally controlled by immune mechanisms. 
Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Basal cell carcinoma is a malignant proliferation of basal cells with invasion of the dermis. Although the 
term “nonmelanoma skin cancer” has traditionally been used to refer to all skin cancers except 
melanoma, “keratinocyte carcinoma” is becoming the preferred term for BCC and Cutaneous squamous 
cell carcinoma (CSCC) because of the shared lineage with epidermal keratinocytes. 
At the molecular level, BCC is one of the mostly highly mutated tumors due to UV-mediated mutagenesis. 
The best characterized oncogenic alterations in BCC are the Hedgehog (Hh) signalling pathway, including 
loss of function mutations in PTCH1 (encoding the inhibitory receptor patched) in ›70% of sporadic BCCs, 
and activating mutations in smoothened (SMO) (encoding the signal transducer smoothened downstream 
of patched) in approximately 20% of sporadic BCCs. A PTCH mutation results in loss of patched-mediated 
inhibition of the G protein coupled receptor Smoothened (SMO), thereby enhancing downstream 
signalling that results in uncontrolled cellular proliferation. Gorlin Syndrome, also known as nevoid basal 
cell carcinoma syndrome, is a rare inherited genetic disorder in which patients carry a germline mutation 
in PTCH1 or other pathway genes that result in aberrant oncogenic signalling of the Hh pathway. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/319415/2021 
Page 7/118 
 
 
 
 
reported median age of onset of Gorlin syndrome ranges from 25 to 44 years, depending on genetic 
variant. 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Common histologic subtypes of BCC are superficial and nodular, and less common subtypes that may be 
more clinically aggressive include morpheaphorm, basosqamous, mixed, and micronodular. More than 
95% of BCCs are cured by surgery. Other local modality treatments, such as topical imiquimod, are 
highly effective treatment options for low-risk BCCs. Most BCCs are slow growing and have low metastatic 
potential. A small percentage of BCCs follow a more aggressive course and are not amenable to radiation, 
surgery, or other local modality treatments. The term “advanced BCC” includes patients with locally 
advanced BCC who have exhausted options for surgery and radiation therapy and patients with 
metastatic BCC. The estimated rate of BCC metastasis ranges from 0.0028% to 0.55%, with regional 
lymph nodes, lung, bones, skin and liver as common metastatic sites. Locally advanced BCCs can cause 
significant destruction of local tissues due to invasive growth patterns when treatment is delayed or 
inadequate. 
Management 
Advanced BCC is a serious condition that includes potentially life-threatening disease for metastatic 
patients and persistent invasive and disfiguring tumors for patients with locally advanced BCC. Despite 
the practice-changing efficacy observed with the HHIs vismodegib and sonidegib for first-line therapy for 
advanced BCC, the limitations of HHIs are that approximately half of patients do not experience objective 
responses (per central review), most responses are partial, and the side effect profiles of these agents 
can create difficulties for long-term therapy. Among ›1400 advanced BCC patients (mostly locally 
advanced BCC patients) treated with vismodegib in the STEVIE and MIKIE studies, approximately 8% 
(116 patients) achieved a durable CR. In addition to the low CR rate, up to 80% of patients interrupted or 
discontinued treatment due to grade ≥3 TEAEs. Lack of efficacy/progressive disease was another 
common reason for discontinuation in advanced BCC patients treated with vismodegib and sonidegib. 
Several small pilot studies of experimental agents in the second-line BCC setting after HHI therapy have 
not provided efficacy signals and/or an acceptable safety profile to warrant further development. 
Itraconazole, an antifungal agent, has been identified as a potent inhibitor of the hedgehog signaling 
pathway. In a proof of concept study, itraconazole was studied in 19 patients, with an average of 4.8 
cutaneous basal cell carcinomas per patient. In one cohort, 15 patients were treated with 200 mg twice 
daily for four weeks prior to surgery; in the other cohort, four patients received 100 mg twice daily for 
one to four months (mean, 2.3 months). Eight patients had tumor reduction and re-epithelialization. Of 
note, none of the three patients previously treated with vismodegib responded. Additional clinical studies 
will be required to determine whether itraconazole has a role in the management of patients with basal 
cell carcinoma. 
Because of the rarity of metastatic basal cell carcinoma, the approach to systemic chemotherapy 
treatment is based primarily upon isolated case reports, with only a few small case series. A case report 
of one patient with basal cell carcinoma metastatic to the lungs observed a complete response with a 
combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel. The authors also reviewed the literature and found 12 other 
patients with metastatic basal cell carcinoma who were treated with platinum-containing regimens. 
Among these 12, five had a complete response and four had a partial response.

2.1.2.  About the product 
Cemiplimab is a fully human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody that binds to the 
programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) receptor and blocks its interaction with its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. 
Engagement of PD-1 with its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, which are expressed by antigen presenting cells 
and may be expressed by tumour cells and/or other cells in the tumour microenvironment, results in 
inhibition of T cell function such as proliferation, cytokine secretion, and cytotoxic activity. Cemiplimab 
potentiates T cell responses, including anti-tumour responses, through blockade of PD-1 binding to PD-L1 
and PD-L2 ligands. Cemiplimab has been already licenced and shown to provide benefit in patients with 
CCSC, which is a very similar disease with BCC, with shared lineage with epidermal keratinocytes.  
The initially applied indication was for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced basal cell 
carcinoma (laBCC) previously treated with a hedgehog pathway inhibitor. 
The finally approved indication is for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic 
basal cell carcinoma (laBCC or mBCC) who have progressed on or are intolerant to a hedgehog pathway 
inhibitor 
The proposed dose of cemiplimab is 350 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W) administered as an intravenous (IV) 
infusion over 30 minutes. This cemiplimab dose and regimen is currently approved for the treatment of 
advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC). Treatment may be continued through initial 
measurable disease progression until symptomatic disease progression or unacceptable toxicity to 
maximize opportunity for patients to experience clinical benefit. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific adviceThe MAH received  
Scientific advice from the CHMP on 10 November 2016 (SA/3225/3/2016). The Scientific advice pertained 
to clinical aspects of the dossier. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The MAH claims that this study is conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their 
origin in the Declaration of Helsinki and that are consistent with the International Council for 
Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and applicable regulatory requirements. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
A claim of exclusion from preparation of environmental risk assessment studies is made according to 
Section 2 of the 2006 CHMP Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for 
Human Use (ERA Guideline) (1) because cemiplimab is a monoclonal antibody consisting of linked 
naturally occurring amino acids. Per the ERA Guideline, "Vitamins, electrolytes, amino acids, peptides, 
proteins, carbohydrates and lipids are exempted because they are unlikely to result in significant risk to 
the environment." 
The justification for not performing any ERA studies is considered acceptable.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The PK and immunogenicity of cemiplimab were assessed in 4 clinical studies: Study 1620 (advanced 
BCC), Study 1423 (FIH), Study 1540 (advanced CSCC), and Study 1624 (advanced NSCLC).

Analytical methods  
For all 4 studies, serum samples for quantitation of functional cemiplimab were analysed using a validated 
enzymelinked immunosorbent assay with a lower limit of quantitation of 78 ng/mL cemiplimab in neat 
serum. The validated method for detecting ADA is a non-quantitative, titer-based, 
electrochemiluminescent bridging immunoassay for screening, confirmation and titer determination. The 
method determined a drug tolerance of 415 µg/mL cemiplimab at a 100 ng/mL ADA sensitivity level. The 
NAb method is an electrochemiluminescence-based competitive ligand binding assay. The bioanalytical 
methods used to determine the concentration of functional cemiplimab and to assess immunogenicity in 
human serum samples are the same assays assessed in the original cemiplimab marketing application for 
CSCC. 
Population PK analyses  
The population PK of cemiplimab has been characterized by nonlinear mixed-effects modelling using FOCE 
with interaction in NONMEM; Uppsala University R version 3.6.1 and R packages of “margsolve” (0.8.12) 
were used for figures and for simulations. 
The initial PopPK model for cemiplimab was a two-compartment model with zero-order IV infusion, linear 
elimination, residual error modelled as additive and proportional residual error and time-varying clearance 
described by a sigmoid-Emax function including a Hill exponent. The initial Pop PK model was based on 
data (N=505) from studies 1423 and 1540 at an earlier data cut-off and later updated with more data 
(N=48) from Study 1540. In the current submission, the Pop PK model was updated with new data from 
patients with different solid tumor types (BCC, CSCC, NSCLC and others) who received cemiplimab 350 
mg Q3W from Studies 1423, 1540, 1620 and 1624. The Pop PK population included a total of 17193 post 
dose concentration data from 1062 patients of which 81 concentrations were BLQ.  
Table 2 Summary of population by tumour type in the analysis dataset  
The final base model (BASE006) for cemiplimab in patients with solid tumors was a 2-compartment model 
with zero-order IV infusion, linear elimination with a time-dependent clearance (sigmoid Emax function) 
and time-varying albumin and baseline body weight as covariates.  
Elimination of cemiplimab by a concentration-dependent clearance was evaluated in the initial Pop PK 
report (not available) and tested again. Base models incorporating a concentration-dependent clearance

(Michaelis–Menten elimination) did not provide a better fit. Inclusion of both concentration-dependent 
clearance and time-dependent clearance did not perform better than using time-dependent CL only. 
Albumin was inversely correlated with the clearance of cemiplimab, ie, the higher albumin level, the lower 
clearance. The testing also indicated time-dependent CL could be induced by other unknown factors, 
aside of time-varying albumin. 
Covariate screening was conducted graphically using plots of empirical Bayes estimates of random 
effects. Potential covariates that are predictive of PK variability of cemiplimab were tested using a 
stepwise covariate search that includes a forward selection process followed by a backward elimination 
procedure with statistical significance testing. The final covariate model included four covariates, weight, 
albumin, IgG (only applicable to studies 1423 and 1540), and disease type (NSCLC relative to CSCC) on 
the elimination clearance CL. Baseline body weight was incorporated into the base structural model with 
the exponent fixed to 0.75 and 1.0 for CL/Q and V1/V2, respectively. Patients with NSCLC tended to have 
higher CL and thus lower exposure than patients with CSCC and BCC, but the resulting exposure across 
tumor types were comparable (<25%).  
Nonparametric bootstrap was performed on 500 replicate datasets and resulted in 95% CIs for population 
PK parameter estimates. Of the 500 runs, 238 (~47.6%) runs converged. Table 25 show the final 
parameter estimates with bootstrap results. The η-shrinkage ranged from 18.5 to 30.4%. The highest η-
shrinkage was observed for EMAX. The conditional number was <10. 
The final model was evaluated by diagnostic plots. Figures below show population predicted vs observed 
concentrations, residual plots of CWRES vs time and predicted concentration. Visual predictive checks 
were constructed to evaluate the model predictability.

Updated Population PK Model 
The interindividual variability (IIV) estimates on Emax and T50 were removed from the model since the 
data may not contain sufficient subject-level information to support the estimation of IIV for these 
parameters. The error structure was simplified by removing the estimation of proportional error and 
estimating log-additive error only. The off-diagonal covariance between inter-individual random effects on 
CLQ and VSS was also removed. The fixed effects structure was added a covariate effect of NSCLC on 
T50, which introduces a delay to the maximum time-varying clearance for NSCLC patients compared to 
the reference population but does not lead to a difference in steady-state clearance values. Goodness-of-
fit and pcVPC plots are provided below.

Simulation of exposure metrics 
The final population PK model was used to generate the post-hoc estimates of individual PK parameters 
and exposure metrics for each subject in the analysis population. The post-hoc analysis indicated that 
cemiplimab clearance (mean, percent coefficient of variation [CV%]) at baseline is 0.293 L/day (33.1%) 
and that clearance decreased by 29.4% (35.3% in responders) to 0.203 L/day (40.2%) at steady-state. 
The elimination half-life of cemiplimab at steady state was 20.3 days (29.2%) in the overall population 
and slightly longer, 22.2 days (25.9%), in responders.

Covariate effects on exposure: The main identified sources of PK variability were body weight, 
albumin, baseline IgG (only applicable to studies 1423 and 1540), and tumor type (NSCLC relative to 
CSCC). Body weight increased slightly during the treatment period, however time-varying body weight 
was not identified as significant covariate. Cemiplimab clearance was greater in patients with lower

albumin levels, relative to a typical patient in the overall population. It was also observed that the 
albumin level was elevated in patients during the treatment period. Baseline PD-L1 levels did not affect 
cemiplimab exposure. The effect of these covariates on the post-hoc estimations of exposure (Cmax, 
Ctrough, and AUC) was relatively small (<25%), and within the typical PK variability observed 
(approximately 30%).

Absorption 
Cemiplimab was administered IV as a 30-minute infusion and peak concentrations (Cmax) is typically 
reached at the end of infusion. Similar distribution profiles were observed in patients with advanced BCC 
(N=136 [132 patients in Study 1620 and 4 patients in Expansion Cohort 25 in Study 1423 and in the 
overall PopPK population (N=1062). In the FIH study 1423, rich PK sampling occurred after the first dose, 
allowing to assess Tmax, while in the pivotal phase 2/3 Studies 1540, 1620 and 1624, sparse PK sample 
collection was applied at pre-dose and end-of-infusion during treatment and at selected time points 
during follow up. Except for the FIH Study 1423, where Cmax could be estimated, concentrations at the 
end-of-infusion were referred to as ‘Cmax’. While maximal cemiplimab concentrations are expected to be 
reached at the end of the 30-minute IV infusion, as anticipated for a monoclonal antibody with a slow 
clearance, very similar concentrations within the bioanalytical range of variability are observed at 1-hour 
and occasionally at 4-hours post-end-of-infusion. As a result, the median value for Tmax in the FIH Study 
1423 is reported as 0.5 hours, with a range of 0.033 hours to 4.0 hours. Assessed by PopPK analysis in 
the overall PopPK population at 350 mg Q3W steady state Ctrough,ss and Cmax,ss were 60.9 mg/L 
(44.9%) and 171 mg/L (27.5%), respectively. In patients with advanced BCC in Study 1620, mean 
(CV%) values of cemiplimab exposure at steady state determined by population PK analysis were Ctrough,ss 
of 73.2 mg/L (45.2%) and Cmax of 180 mg/L (28.6%).

Distribution 
Based on PopPK analysis, the mean (CV%) total volume of distribution at steady state is 5.3 L. 
Elimination 
The clearance of cemiplimab is independent of dose for the regimens studied (1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg every 
2 weeks [Q2W]. Due to study design and the need for continued treatment (where appropriate) limited 
data were available to fully characterize cemiplimab PK in the off-treatment period.  
Clearance (mean CV%) of cemiplimab after the first dose is approximately 0.293 L/day (33.1%).  After 
repeated dosing, total clearance (CL) appeared to decrease by approximately 29.4% over the first 4 to 5 
months of treatment, resulting in a CL at steady state of 0.203 L/day (40.2%).  The mean (CV%) within-
treatment interval half-life at steady state as is 20.3 days (29.2%).   
The clearance at baseline and the time-dependent decrease in clearance over time in ‘responders’ and ‘all 
others’ across different tumour types (advanced BCC, advanced CSCC, and advanced NSCLC) is shown 
below. 
Assessment report  
EMA/319415/2021 
Page 29/118 
 
 
 
 
In the overall PopPK population (N=1062; below) after repeated dosing, the total clearance of cemiplimab 
appears to decrease over time by about 29.4% from a baseline value of 0.293 L/day (33.1%) down to 
0.203 L/day (40.2%; below). The decrease in clearance was somewhat larger in patients who were 
considered “responders” to cemiplimab (-35.3%) compared with “all others” (-26.7%) 
Table 9: Summary of the overall population PK and PK analysis set 
This observed difference in the time-varying clearance between “responders” and “all other” patients in 
the overall population is largely driven by the effect in patients with NSCLC; as the time-variant 
decrease). This time dependent decrease in clearance for “responders” versus “all other” patients with 
BCC was quite similar (29.6% versus 26.0%, respectively). 
Based on the PopPK analysis, the between dose-interval mean half-life of cemiplimab at steady state in 
patients with solid tumors is 20.3 days (29.2%); in patients with advanced BCC it was 22.5 days 
(24.1%). As a result of the differences in change in clearance over time between patients with solid 
tumors considered “responders” and “all others”, it was observed that patients who responded to 
cemiplimab treatment exhibit longer half-life at steady state than ‘all others’ with mean (CV%) values of 
22.2 days [25.9%] and 19.5 days [29.9%], respectively. However, in patients with advanced BCC, where 
this is a very comparable time-variant change in clearance, the half-life between “responders” and “all 
other” patients were also quite similar, with a mean (CV%) elimination half-life at steady state of 23.8 
days (21.0%) in “responders” and 22.1 days (25.0%) in “all others”.

Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
As described in the initial application, the mean exposure of cemiplimab generally increased in a dose 
proportional manner over the studied dosing regimens (1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg Q2W); with a subtle signal 
of an enhanced deviation from dose proportionality in the Ctrough at the end of the dosing interval for the 
lowest dose studied of 1 mg/kg (CSCC Submission). Typically, the observation of systemic linear PK is 
associated with saturation of the target-mediated pathway.   
Linearity and dose proportionality of cemiplimab exposure was observed over a dose range of 1 mg/kg to 
10 mg/kg Q2W in the FIH Study 1423, including both monotherapy and combination therapy, and 
different solid tumor types, including 4 patients with BCC in the expansion cohorts. This was further 
confirmed by PopPK analysis using integrated data of the overall PopPK population (1062 patients) of the 
4 studies combined. In patients with advanced BCC treated with cemiplimab at 350 mg Q3W, systemic 
concentrations of cemiplimab were identified by PopPK analysis to reside within the linear dose-
proportional range. 
Cemiplimab exposure in patients with solid tumors reach steady state by 4 months (16 weeks) of 
cemiplimab dosing (>90% of plateau). This was assessed by PopPK analysis and illustrated by observed 
concentrations in patients with advanced BCC, advanced CSCC, and advanced NSCLC at 350 mg Q3W 
(Figure 3, below). The accumulation index upon Q3W dosing is 2.18, indicating an accumulation upon 
repeated dosing of approximately 2-fold. The PopPK model estimated that 90% the plateau of the AUC3wks 
exposure is reached by week 16 (after 5 Q3W doses, and 97% of the plateau of AUC3wks exposure is 
reached by week 25 (after 8 Q3W doses).

Special populations 
Of all the covariates investigated in the overall PopPK population in 1062 patients across 4 studies, 
statistically significant intrinsic sources of PK variability were body weight, albumin, tumor type (NSCLC 
relative to CSCC), and baseline IgG levels (limited to Studies 1423 and 1540; Table 11 below).  
While tumor type (NSCLC) was one of the statistically significant covariates, the resulting exposure across 
tumor types, including advanced CSCC, advanced BCC, and advanced NSCLC, was comparable (~10%). 
No other tested covariates, including demographics (ie, age) and baseline PD-L1 level, had a statistically 
significant effect on cemiplimab exposure. The effect of all covariates combined on the post-hoc 
estimations of exposure (Cmax, Cmin, and AUC) was relatively small (<25%) and within the typical PK 
variability observed of approximately 30%.

Body Weight 
Typical of monoclonal antibodies and other large protein therapeutic agents for which the central 
compartment largely comprises the systemic volume, drug exposure is correlated with body weight and 
body mass index (BMI). Consistent with these findings, the PopPK analysis in the overall patient 
population with a mean body weight of 75.8 kg and ranging from 30.9 kg to 172 kg showed a modest 
decrease in cemiplimab exposure with increasing body weight with this fixed dosing regimen.  
Given the small variation in Cmin due to body weight, systemic concentrations of cemiplimab remain 
sufficient to maintain linear kinetics over the dosing intervals. 
Assessment report  
EMA/319415/2021

In mBCC patients, 5 patients had a BMI ≥30 kg/m2 and in this group no responses were noted, in laBCC 
patients with a BMI ≥30 kg/m2, ORR was 33.3% (7 of 21; 95% CI 14.6% to 57.0%) with a KM estimated 
median duration of response that has not been reached.  
Patients with advanced BCC (n=132) on cemiplimab 350 mg Q3W therapy in the PopPK population, 
comprised 22 moderately obese (BMI 30 to 34.9 kg/m2), 8 severely obese (BMI 35 to 39.9 kg/m2) and 2 
extremely obese (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2) patients. Predicted cemiplimab exposure at steady state in 
moderately and severely obese patients was within the variability of exposure, although slightly lower (<-
30%) than the population exposure. In very severely obese patients, exposure was slightly lower (-50%) 
compared to the overall patient population and with Cmin values >20 mg/L, thus still exceeding systemic 
target saturation. 
Individual observed cemiplimab concentrations in patients with advanced BCC who received cemiplimab 
350 mg Q3W with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 for laBCC patients (n=21) and for mBCC patients (n=11), in relation 
to their response based on Best Overall Response (BOR), showed that the 7 patients with laBCC (6 obese 
and 1 severely obese) responded to cemiplimab therapy. 
Age 
In the overall population of patients with solid tumors, age was 65 years on average, and ranged from 27 
to 96 years. Based on the PopPK analysis, age did not affect the PK of cemiplimab in the overall PopPK 
population of patients with solid tumours; the same applies to the patients with advanced BCC. 
Sex 
The complete patient population with solid tumors on cemiplimab treatment included 750 males and 312 
females. Sex was not identified as a statistically significant covariate of cemiplimab exposure. A post-hoc 
analysis indicates that female patients tend to have higher exposure at 350 mg Q3W. This is caused by a

From the observed data of Cmax and Ctrough following the first dose, as well as after achieving steady state, 
there was no apparent difference in the exposure to cemiplimab in patients with laBCC or mBCC.  
Consistently, the PopPK covariate analysis did not identify laBCC versus mBCC as a statistical covariate.

Baseline Performance Status 
By PopPK covariate analysis, baseline ECOG status was not identified as a statistically significant 
covariate. Consistently, in the post-hoc assessment of ECOG status, there is no apparent difference in 
exposure with the differences in Ctrough,ss, and AUC3wk,ss being <25% after cemiplimab 350 mg Q3W, with 
respect to the baseline ECOG status.   
Renal impairment 
The effect of renal impairment on the exposure of cemiplimab was evaluated in patients with mild (CLCr 
60 to 89 mL/min; n=396), moderate (CLCr 30 to <59 mL/min; n=166), or severe (CLCr 15 to 29 
mL/min; n=7) renal impairment and were compared to patients with normal renal (CLCr ≥90 mL/min; 
n=493). 
Consistent with other monoclonal antibodies, cemiplimab elimination by the renal route is likely to be 
insignificant as its large size prevents efficient filtration through the glomerulus. Therefore, renal 
impairment is not expected to affect the PK of cemiplimab.  
Consistent with this, renal function was not identified as a significant covariate in the PopPK model.

Hepatic Impairment 
By PopPK covariate analysis, hepatic impairment was not identified as a statistically significant covariate. 
The effect of baseline total bilirubin on the exposure of cemiplimab was evaluated and the results are 
presented with summary statistics by hepatic impairment categories based on total bilirubin (expressed 
as [value/ULN], where ULN is the upper limit of normal range) and any AST and ALT levels. In patients 
(n=22) with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin greater than 1.0 to 1.5 times the ULN) and 3 patients 
with moderate (total bilirubin >1.5 ULN) hepatic impairment, no differences in the exposure of 
cemiplimab were found between patients with mild/moderate hepatic impairment and patients with 
normal hepatic function.

Extrinsic Factors 
Extrinsic covariates tested included treatment (monotherapy versus combination therapies with radiation 
and/or chemotherapy) and country (site, region). 
Treatment (Monotherapy versus Combination Therapy) 
There is no apparent difference (<25%) in cemiplimab exposure (AUCtau,ss or Ctrough,ss) in patients 
treated with cemiplimab as monotherapy compared with patients treated with cemiplimab in combination 
therapies, including radiotherapy and chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, carboplatin, docetaxel, 
paclitaxel, or GM-CSF (Table 23). 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No PK interaction studies have been submitted (see discussion on Clinical Pharmacology).  
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Change in tumor size is used as a measure of pharmacodynamic effect of cemiplimab and provides a 
pharmacodynamic perspective of the biological response (decrease in tumor size) per the Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria, which describes a standard approach to solid 
tumor measurement and definitions for objective assessment of change in tumor size in adult and 
paediatric clinical studies (Eisenhauer, 2009).

Spider plots provide a comprehensive perspective regarding the kinetics of responses, illustrating the 
percent changes in target lesion measurements over time for individual patients described in Study 1620. 
In addition to displaying the emerging durability of responses among patients with locally advanced BCC 
and metastatic BCC, spider plots also show that many of the responses deepen over time. Spider plots for 
percent changes in target lesions were provided in 17 patients with mBCC (Figure 15) and in 64 patients 
with laBCC Figure 16). Inspection of the spider plot for locally advanced BCC patients reveals several 
patients in which there were apparent increases in tumor measurements, followed by subsequent 
reductions according to ICR 
Change in tumor size is presented as a measure of pharmacodynamic effect of cemiplimab. Change in 
tumor size provides a pharmacodynamic perspective of the biological response (decrease in tumor size). 
Assessment of tumor size is a component of the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 
1.1 criteria, which describes a standard approach to solid tumor measurement and definitions for 
objective assessment of change in tumor size in adult and paediatric clinical studies (Eisenhauer, 2009). 
Spider plots provide a comprehensive perspective regarding the kinetics of responses, illustrating the 
percent changes in target lesion measurements over time for individual patients described in Study 1620. 
In addition to displaying the emerging durability of responses among patients with locally advanced BCC 
and metastatic BCC, spider plots also show that many of the responses deepen over time. Spider plots for 
percent changes in target lesions were provided in 17 patients with mBCC (Figure 15) and in 64 patients 
with laBCC Figure 16).

Mechanism of action 
Cemiplimab is a high affinity, fully human, hinge stabilized IgG4P antibody directed to the PD 1 receptor 
that blocks the interaction of PD 1 with its ligands, PD L1 and PD L2. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Exposure-response assessments are provided for efficacy and safety. The relationship between 
cemiplimab exposure in serum and efficacy endpoints in patients with advanced BCC was assessed for 
objective response rate (ORR) by logistic regression analysis. In addition, the relationship between 
cemiplimab exposure and the primary efficacy endpoints were investigated using Kaplan Meier analysis. 
Exposure-response relationships are displayed in figure 17-21 below. For safety, the integrated database 
for this application includes 3 safety pools: 1) patients with advanced BCC from Study 1620 who received 
cemiplimab 350 mg Q3W as monotherapy [Safety Pool 1]; 2) all patients from Studies 1423, 1540, 1620, 
and 1624 who received cemiplimab as monotherapy (at any dose) [Safety Pool 2]; and 3) all patients 
from Studies 1423, 1540, 1620, and 1624 who received cemiplimab as monotherapy or in combination 
with radiotherapy and/or with chemotherapy [Safety Pool 3]. These safety pools are used in the E-R 
analysis of safety. Exposure-Safety relationships are displayed in figure 22-25 below.

Immunogenicity 
Immunogenicity was assessed in all 4 studies. Samples for ADA assessment were collected prior to dosing 
at several time points. The incidence of treatment-emergent immunogenicity was low (2.2%) in all 
patients (N = 823) receiving cemiplimab at any dose and regimen and was low (2.3%) in all patients (N 
= 385) receiving cemiplimab 350 mg Q3W. Antibody titers were all low with the exception of 1 patient 
who exhibited moderate ADA titers. Of the patients who developed treatment emergent antibodies to 
cemiplimab, none developed NAb. The incidence of persistent ADA was low (0.4%) in all patients 
receiving cemiplimab.  
Neither of the 2 patients with advanced BCC who were included in the ADA analysis set in Study 1423 
tested positive for ADA. The immunogenicity results in patients with advanced BCC from Study 1620 (125 
patients, including 44 patients with mBCC and 81 patients with laBCC), showed 4 of 125 patients (3.2%) 
with a treatment-emergent ADA response; 2 were transient and 2 were indeterminate, all with a low titer 
(titer<1000). No neutralizing antibodies (NAb) were detected in the patients with a positive response in 
the ADA assay.

2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The PK and immunogenicity of cemiplimab were assessed in 4 clinical studies: Study 1620 (advanced 
BCC), Study 1423 (FIH), Study 1540 (advanced CSCC), and Study 1624 (advanced NSCLC). 
Spider plots for percent changes in target lesions in patients with advanced BCC in 17 patients with 
advanced mBCC and in 64 patients with advanced laBCC were provided. Inspection of the spider plot for 
locally advanced BCC patients reveals several patients in which there were apparent increases in tumor 
measurements, followed by subsequent reductions according to ICR. In one case there was an initial 
increase in tumor measurements by photography, followed by tumor reduction with -48% reduction in 
product of diameters at the third tumor assessment. Per the ICRC, the best overall response for this 
patient was PD. Other patients in which dimensions of externally visible tumors fluctuated over time were 
a patient who had best response of SD per the ICRC, and another patient who had best response of PR 
per ICRC. These cases illustrate the varied kinetics of changes in tumor measurements for some

advanced BCC patients treated with cemiplimab and underscore that prolonged tumor treatment may be 
required for some patients to achieve maximal tumor regressions. 
Consistent with the initial PopPK assessments in support of the initial marketing application, the kinetics 
of cemiplimab in the overall population could be described by a two-compartment model with a time-
varying component on clearance and of baseline albumin. The model was not stable as less than half of 
500 bootstrap runs converged. The PopPK model was updated. Estimation of inter-individual variability on 
Emax and T50 were removed, the proportional error model was changed to a log-additive error model 
and the off-diagonal covariance between inter-individual random effects on CLQ and VSS was also 
removed. A covariate effect of NSCLC on T50 was included which improved the model notably. The 
updated model was evaluated using bootstrap (n=500) and all runs converged successfully. The provided 
GoF plots and pc-VPCs indicated the model could adequately describe the observed concentrations of 
cemiplimab in non-NSCLC and NSCLC patients. The fixed allometric exponents are considered to 
sufficiently capture the cemiplimab weight-PK covariate relationships. No other significant trends could be 
observed in plots of Empirical Bayes Estimates versus covariates. Exclusion of outlier concentrations did 
not change the population PK parameter estimates in a relevant manner. 
With continuous treatment of 350 mg Q3W steady state was reached by approximately 16 weeks, with an 
accumulation ratio of approximately 2-fold. Cemiplimab is primarily distributed in the vascular system 
with a volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss) of 5.3 l. Median Tmax occurs at the end of the 30-minute 
infusion (see SmPC section 5.2.). 
Clearance of cemiplimab is linear at doses of 1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg every two weeks. Cemiplimab 
clearance after the first dose is approximately 0.293 l/day. The total clearance appears to decrease by 
approximately 29.4% over time, resulting in a steady state clearance (CLss) of 0.201 l/day; the decrease 
in CL is not considered clinically relevant. The within dosing interval half-life at steady state is 20.3 days. 
At the dosing regimens of 1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg every two weeks, pharmacokinetics of cemiplimab were 
observed to be linear and dose proportional, suggesting saturation of the systemic target mediated 
pathway. 
A population PK analysis suggests that the following factors have no clinically significant effect on the 
exposure of cemiplimab: age, gender, body weight, race, cancer type, albumin level, renal impairment, 
and mild to moderate hepatic impairment and renal impairment. 
Consistent with other monoclonal antibodies, cemiplimab as a monoclonal antibody, is not subject to 
elimination through the renal or hepatic pathways as such no specific studies for renal or hepatic 
impairment were conducted. The impact of renal and hepatic impairment on cemiplimab PK was assessed 
through PopPK analysis. No difference in cemiplimab exposure due to renal impairment or mild to 
moderate hepatic impairment was identified. However, the individual predicted exposure at steady-state 
(AUC3wks,ss) was observed to increase with increasing severity of renal impairment. Notably, the increase 
in severity of renal impairment was also associated with a consistent reduction in body weight. As body 
weight is a known covariate of exposure for monoclonal antibodies in general as well as for cemiplimab 
this difference in exposure is most likely explained by the indirect effect of body weight and is unlikely to 
reflect a direct effect of renal function on cemiplimab PK. 
No clinically important differences in the exposure of cemiplimab were found between patients with renal 
impairment and patients with normal renal function. Cemiplimab has not been studied in patients with 
CLcr <25 21 ml/min (see SmPC section 4.2 and 5.2). 
The effect of hepatic impairment on the exposure of cemiplimab was evaluated by population PK analysis. 
In patients with mild hepatic impairment (n= 225) (total bilirubin [TB] greater than 1.0 to 1.5 times the 
upper limit of normal [ULN] and any aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) and patients with moderate 
hepatic impairment (n=3) (total bilirubin >1.5 times ULN up to 3.0 times ULN) and any AST; no clinically 
Assessment report  
EMA/319415/2021 
Page 59/118 
 
 
 
important differences in the exposure of cemiplimab were found compared to patients with normal 
hepatic function. Cemiplimab has not been studied in patients with moderate orsevere hepatic 
impairment. There are insufficient data in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment for dosing 
recommendations (see SmPC section 4.2). 
Based on PopPK analysis of the overall population, the initial mean total clearance of cemiplimab 
decreased by about 29.4% over the first 4 to 5 months. This decrease in clearance in the overall 
population is larger in patients who were classified as responders. However, in patients with BCC the 
decrease in clearance was similar in patients between “responders” and “all other” patients (29.6% 
versus 26.0%). Consistently, the difference in half-life between “responders” and “all other” patients was 
also unremarkable in patients with BCC (23.8 days versus 22.1 days, respectively).  
The identified intrinsic sources of PK variability are body weight, albumin, tumor type (NSCLC) and 
baseline IgG. Baseline PD-L1 and BCC tumor type were not identified as statistically significant covariates.  
The effect of the all covariates combined on the post hoc estimations of exposure (Cmax, Cmin, and AUC) 
was relatively small (<25%), and within the typical PK variability observed of approximately 30%. None 
of the other baseline demographic characteristics tested (eg, age, race, or gender) or extrinsic covariates 
(eg, monotherapy versus combination therapy, country, or study) were found to be statistically 
significant. Data are limited in patients ≥75 years on cemiplimab monotherapy (see SmPC section 4.2). 
Clinical efficacy has been observed in patients with advanced BCC who have moderate or severe obesity. 
However, exposure at steady state in moderately and severely obese patients was lower (<-30%) than 
the population exposure. In very severely obese patients, exposure was slightly lower (-50%) compared 
to the overall patient population.  
Cemiplimab is not anticipated to interact directly or indirectly with cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes 
therefore no specific drug-drug interaction studies of cemiplimab with other drugs were conducted. 
No meaningful E-R relationships were observed for all explored efficacy endpoints (ORR based on best 
objective response [BOR], DOR, overall survival [OS], and PFS) and for the explored safety endpoints 
(imAEs of all grades and imAEs of grade ≥3) with exposure metrics (after the first dose and at steady 
state) in patients with advanced BCC receiving cemiplimab (350 mg Q3W) as monotherapy (Safety Pool 
1), patients in all 4 studies receiving cemiplimab monotherapy (Safety Pool 2), or patients in all 4 studies 
receiving cemiplimab monotherapy or combination therapy (Safety Pool 3).  
The selected dosing regimen of 350 mg Q3W IV in patients with advanced BCC was supported by 
preliminary efficacy data in the FIH Study 1423, the evolving efficacy data in the treatment of advanced 
CSCC (Study 1540), as well as the combined safety data in 1078 patients across the cemiplimab 
program. In Study 1423, cemiplimab demonstrated comparable PK properties in patients with CSCC and 
BCC. However, the Applicant has not been able to demonstrate any E-R relationships. Therefore, it is 
difficult to evaluate whether the proposed dose of 350 mg Q3W is the most optimal dose in patients with 
advanced BCC.  
Based on the mechanism of action of cemiplimab as an anti-PD1 agent acting at the level of the T-cells, 
considering that drug concentrations at the clinical doses 1) exceed systemic target saturation, as 
demonstrated by linear pharmacokinetics and elimination. and 2) are similar regardless of the tumor 
types, 3) that efficacy has been demonstrated in multiple tumor types (including advanced CSCC, BCC 
and NSCLC) and that E-R relationships for efficacy were flat in patients with advanced BCC over the 
exposure range studied at the clinical dose, it is reasonable to conclude that the 350 mg Q3W dosing 
strategy is an acceptable therapeutic dose in patients with BCC and across multiple tumor types. An 
evaluation of the lacking E-R relationships should consider that cemiplimab concentrations at the clinical 
doses exceed systemic target saturation, as demonstrated by linear pharmacokinetics and elimination. In 
addition, drug concentrations are similar regardless of the tumor types, and it is therefore reasonable to 
Assessment report  
EMA/319415/2021

conclude that the 350 mg Q3W dosing strategy is an acceptable therapeutic dose in patients with BCC 
and across multiple tumor types. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall the clinical pharmacology of cemiplimab have been adequately described for patients with 
advanced or metastatic BCC. The 350 mg Q3W is considered an acceptable therapeutic dose in patients 
with BCC and across multiple tumour types.

Acceptable contraindications in the surgeon’s note included: 
a.  BCC that had recurred in the same location after 2 or more surgical procedures and curative 
resection was deemed unlikely 
b.  BCCs with significant local invasion that precluded complete resection 
c.  BCCs in anatomically challenging locations for which surgery might have resulted in severe

study, and the radiation therapy was deemed to be contraindicated. Acceptable 
contraindications to radiation therapy in the investigator’s note for patients who had not 
received any prior radiation included: 
Assessment report  
EMA/319415/2021 
Page 63/118 
 
 
 
BCCs in anatomically challenging locations for which radiation therapy would be associated 
with unacceptable toxicity risk in the context of the patient’s overall medical condition in the 
opinion of the multidisciplinary team (eg, a neck tumor for which radiation therapy would 
result in potential need for a percutaneous gastrostomy tube). A copy of the investigator’s 
consultation note documenting the multidisciplinary assessment must have been submitted. 
Exclusion Criteria 
A patient who met any of the following criteria was excluded from the study: 
1.  Ongoing or recent (within 5 years) evidence of significant autoimmune disease that required 
treatment with systemic immunosuppressive treatments, which may have suggested risk for 
immune-related adverse events (irAEs). The following were not exclusionary: vitiligo, childhood 
asthma that has resolved, type 1 diabetes, residual hypothyroidism that required only hormone 
replacement, or psoriasis that did not require systemic treatment. 
2.  Prior treatment with an agent that blocks the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway 
3.  Prior treatment with other systemic immune-modulating agents within fewer than 28 days prior to 
the first dose of REGN2810. Examples of immune-modulating agents included therapeutic 
vaccines, cytokine treatments, or agents that target cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4), 
4-1BB (CD137), or OX-40. 
Note in clarification: Prior treatment with imiquimod or other topical or intralesional immune 
modulators were not exclusionary 
4.  Untreated brain metastasis(es) that may have been considered active. (Note: patients with brain 
involvement of BCC due to direct extension of invading tumor, rather than metastasis, may have 
been allowed to enroll if they did not require >10 mg prednisone daily, after discussion and 
approval of the medical monitor). Patients with previously treated brain metastases could 
participate provided that the lesion(s) was (were) stable (without evidence of progression for at 
least 6 weeks on imaging obtained in the screening period), and there was no evidence of new or 
enlarging brain metastases, and the patients did not require any immunosuppressive doses of 
systemic corticosteroids for management of brain metastasis(es) within 28 days of the first dose 
of REGN2810. 
5.  Immunosuppressive corticosteroid doses (>10 mg prednisone daily or equivalent) within 4 weeks 
prior to the first dose of cemiplimab. 
6.  Active infection requiring therapy, including positive tests for human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV)-1 or HIV-2 serum antibody, hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
7.  History of pneumonitis within the last 5 years 
8.  Any anticancer treatment other than radiation therapy (chemotherapy, targeted systemic 
therapy, imiquimod, photodynamic therapy), investigational or standard of care, within 30 days of 
the initial administration of cemiplimab or planned to occur during the study period (patients 
receiving bisphosphonates or denosumab were allowed because these were not considered 
anticancer treatments in this protocol) 
9.  History of documented allergic reactions or acute hypersensitivity reaction attributed to antibody 
treatments 
10. Patients with allergy or hypersensitivity to cemiplimab or to any of the excipients were excluded. 
Specifically, because of the presence of trace components in cemiplimab, patients with allergy or 
hypersensitivity to doxycycline or tetracycline were excluded.  
Assessment report  
EMA/319415/2021

Trace components of doxycycline were present in earlier clinical trial material, but are not present 
in the cell lines used to make later clinical trial or commercial materials. 
11. Concurrent malignancy other than BCC and/or history of malignancy other than BCC within 3 
years of date of first planned dose of REGN2810, except for tumors with negligible risk of 
metastasis or death, such as adequately treated CSCC of the skin, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, 
or ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast, or low-risk early stage prostate adenocarcinoma (T1-T2a 
N0M0 and Gleason score <6 and PSA <10 ng/mL) for which the management plan is active 
surveillance, or prostate adenocarcinoma with biochemical-only recurrence with documented PSA 
doubling time of >12 months for which the management plan was active surveillance (D'Amico, 
2005) (Pham, 2016). Patients with hematologic malignancies (eg, chronic lymphocytic leukemia) 
were excluded. 
12. Any acute or chronic psychiatric problems that, in the opinion of the investigator, made the 
patient ineligible for participation 
13. Patients with a history of solid organ transplant (patients with prior corneal transplants could be 
allowed to enroll after discussion with and approval from the medical monitor) 
14. Any medical co-morbidity, physical examination finding, or metabolic dysfunction, or clinical 
laboratory abnormality that, in the opinion of the investigator, rendered the patient unsuitable for 
participation in a clinical trial due to high safety risks and/or potential to affect interpretation of 
results of the study  
15. Inability to undergo any contrast-enhanced radiologic response assessment 
16. Breastfeeding  
17. Positive serum pregnancy test (a false positive pregnancy test, if demonstrated by serial 
measurements and negative ultrasound, was not exclusionary, upon communication with and 
approval from the medical monitor) 
18. Receipt of live vaccines (including attenuated) within 30 days of first study treatment  
19. Women of childbearing potential who were unwilling to practice highly effective contraception 
prior to the start of the first treatment, during the study, and for at least 6 months after the last 
dose. Highly effective contraceptive measures included stable use of combined (estrogen and 
progestogen containing) hormonal contraception (oral, intravaginal, transdermal) or progestogen-
only hormonal contraception (oral, injectable, implantable) associated with inhibition of ovulation 
initiated 2 or more menstrual cycles prior to screening; intrauterine device (IUD); intrauterine 
hormone-releasing system (IUS); bilateral tubal ligation; vasectomized partner; and or sexual 
abstinence. 
20. Prior treatment with idelalisib

The primary objective of the study was to estimate the ORR for mBCC (Group 1) or unresectable laBCC 
(Group 2), according to central review, when treated with cemiplimab monotherapy in patients who had 
progressed on HHI therapy, or were intolerant of prior HHI therapy.  
Secondary Objectives 
The secondary objectives for all groups were to: 
•  Estimate ORR according to investigator review 
•  Estimate the duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS) by central and 
investigator review, and overall survival (OS) 
Exploratory Objectives (Group 2 Only) 
As specified in the protocol, these exploratory objectives were only planned for Group 2, given the 
expected accessibility of lesions in the locally advanced group. The exploratory objectives were to explore 
the pharmacodynamic effects of cemiplimab in tumor biopsies obtained at baseline, during treatment, and 
at progression in BCC patients treated with cemiplimab, and to assess predictive potential and correlation 
to clinical response for biomarkers of interest including but not limited to: 
• 
Tumor RNA expression 
•  Number and distribution of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) (CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, T 
regulatory cells, and tissue permitting, other subtypes such as B cells, myeloid-derived cells, 
natural killer [NK] cells, etc.) 
•  Expression levels (mRNA and/or protein) of programmed death ligand 1(PD-L1), glucocorticoid-
induced TNFR family related gene (GITR), and lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3), and 
possibly other check-point modulators 
•  Mutations in known oncogenes and potential tumor neoantigens 
• 
Tumor mutational burden 
•  Assess the impact of cemiplimab on quality of life using European Organisation for Research and 
Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) and Skindex-16 
Outcomes/endpoints

Sample size 
50 patients were planned to be enrolled in group 1 and 80 patients in group 2 (to provide at least 85% 
power to reject a null hypothesis of an ORR of 20% at a 2-sided significance level of 5% if the true ORR is 
35%). At the time of data cut off as of 17 Feb 2020 where an interim analysis was conducted with a 
subsequent new data cut off as of 30 Jun 2020, 138 patients were included in the study 1620 FAS (84 
patients with locally advanced BCC and 54 patients with metastatic BCC. All patients but 26 patients in 
the mBCC group (in total 112 patients) had the opportunity to be followed from onset of response for at 
least 6 months. 
Randomisation 
This a non-randomised phase 2 study. 
Blinding (masking) 
This is an open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
For continuous variables, descriptive statistics included the following: the number of patients reflected in 
the calculation (n), mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum. In addition, 25th 
percentile and 75th percentile is provided. 
For categorical or ordinal data, frequencies and percentages were displayed for each category. The 
denominator was determined by the analysis population used for the summary. 
For time-to-event variables, median time-to-event (and the survival rate at a fixed time point) and its 2-
sided 95% confidence intervals were summarized by the Kaplan-Meier method, unless otherwise 
specified. 
Statistical analysis for efficacy in mBCC and laBCC was conducted independently. 
In order to describe ORR and DOR, the data cut for primary efficacy analysis allowed responding patients 
to be followed from onset of response for at least 6 months. For primary analysis, the last patient in a 
group had the opportunity to be followed for approximately 57 weeks, including 27 weeks (cycles 1 to 3) 
for response, plus an additional 30 weeks (cycles 4 to 6) for DOR. If the last patient(s) had early EOS, the 
timing of data cut was determined by the enrollment date of the last enrolled patient who remained on 
study (first dose + approximately 57 weeks). 
An interim analysis of mBCC patients was performed at the time of the primary analysis for laBCC 
patients.  
An updated analysis of the response duration will be performed after all responding patients have been 
followed for a minimum of 12 months from onset of response. 
Interim Analysis 
An interim analysis of mBCC patients was performed at the time of the primary analysis for laBCC 
patients. All mBCC patients enrolled on or prior to the cutoff date were included in the safety analysis. All 
mBCC patients who had the opportunity to be followed from onset of response for at least 6 months were 
included in the efficacy analysis (that is, mBCC patients who had the opportunity to be followed for 
Assessment report

approximately 57 weeks – including 27 weeks (cycles 1 to 3) for response, plus an additional 30 weeks 
[cycles 4 to 6] for DOR). 
For regions where, alpha spending was not required: For this interim analysis on mBCC patients, the ORR 
and associated 95% confidence interval were summarized. As the primary objective of this interim 
analysis was point estimation on ORR and characterizing the precision of point estimation, there was no 
hypothesis testing associated with this interim analysis. Also, no decisions were made regarding study 
conduct associated with the interim analysis. Therefore, Type I error adjustment was not applicable for 
this planned interim analysis. At the time of the final analysis for mBCC patients, 95% exact confidence 
intervals will be reported. 
For regions where, alpha spending is required: For this interim analysis on mBCC patients, a 2-sided 
alpha of 0.0001 was allocated for interim analysis, and a 2-sided alpha of 0.0499 was preserved for the 
final analysis. Correspondingly, for the interim analysis of the primary endpoint of ORR in mBCC patients, 
the precision of ORR was estimated by an adjusted and 2-sided 99.99% exact confidence interval. The 
unadjusted and 2-sided 95% exact confidence interval was also reported at the time of interim analysis. 
At the time of the final analysis for mBCC patients, both adjusted 95.01% and unadjusted 95% exact 
confidence intervals will be reported. 
For other efficacy endpoints in mBCC patients, only a 2-sided 95% exact confidence interval was 
presented at the interim and will also be presented at the final analysis. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Figure 9 Participant flow - as of the 17 Feb 2020 data cut. 
As of the data cutoff for this interim CSR, a total of 170 patients were screened with 32 screen-failures at 
49 sites in 10 countries. In the 134-day interval between 17 Feb 2020 to 30 Jun 2020 group 1 (mBCC) 
completed enrollment of 54 patients (53 planned), with 6 additional patients enrolled in this period (in 
total 138 patients). The data cut for the primary analysis for Group 1 is projected to occur on 20 May

2021, which represents 57 weeks from cycle 1/day 1 for the 54th patient enrolled in Group 1. As of the 
30 Jun 2020 data cutoff, treatment was ongoing for 40 patients (29.0%). The most common reason for 
premature treatment discontinuation was disease progression (40.6% [56/138]), followed by AEs in 17 
patients (12.3%). Death was reported as the reason for discontinuation in 3 (2.2%) patients. 
Recruitment 
The analyses include data from all patients in study 1620 who received their first dose of cemiplimab on 
or before 07 January 2019, which is the date that group 2 (locally advanced BCC) completed enrolment 
(N=84) and the interim analysis was conducted for group 2. 
As of the data cutoff sites from Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Spain, 
Switzerland, and the United States (US) participated in this study. 
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol was amended 4 times. The rationale for each amendment is summarized below:

Numbers analysed 
Data cutoff as of 30 June 2020 
A total of 138 patients who met criteria as of the data cutoff date were included in the FAS, and 138 
patients who met criteria as of the data cutoff were included in the SAF (data cutoff 30.06.2020). A total 
of 132 and 125 patients who met criteria were included in the PK and ADA analysis sets, respectively 
(data cutoff 17.02.2020). 
The full analysis set (FAS) includes all enrolled patients for each group who passed screening and were 
deemed to be eligible for this study. All efficacy endpoints were analyzed using FAS by group. 
At the time of data cutoff as of 17 Feb 2020, the median duration of follow-up in the FAS was 15.06 
months (range: 0.5 to 25.1 months) for locally advanced BCC patients, 9.46 months (range: 1.5 to 27.2 
months) for metastatic BCC patients, and 13.26 months (range: 0.5 to 27.2 months) for the combined 
total of advanced BCC patients.

Group 1 is the mBCC cohort for Study 1620 and reached its planned total enrollment of 54 patients as of 
09 April 2020 and has been closed to enrollment.  
On 30 June 2020, a new data cut was performed for the purpose of confirming responses for 2 laBCC 
patients who had BOR (per central review) of “unconfirmed response” at the 17 February data cut;  
investigator-assessed efficacy data have been extracted from that data cut off. 
Per protocol, efficacy data are considered mature when a patient has opportunity for at least 57 weeks of 
follow up. Therefore, the mBCC interim analysis for efficacy in the initial submission was also comprised 
of those patients (N = 28) who had opportunity or at least 57 weeks of follow up at the 17 February 2020 
data cut.

Ancillary analyses 
PD-L1 expression in tumor cells by IHC in pretreatment tumor samples was done on an exploratory basis, 
without formal validation. The PD-L1 assay was performed by a third-party vendor (Ventana) using the 
SP263 antibody clone. Based on previous experience in other indications, to preserve antigenicity, slides 
should have been stained within 6 months from the date that sections were mounted on slides. Slides 
that were >6 months old were considered unevaluable. 
Pretreatment tumor samples were available for PD-L1 IHC testing in 50 of 84 laBCC patients (Appendix 
16). Table 26 presents centrally reviewed ORR data and PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) at 4 
different cutoffs (<1%, ≥1% to <5%, ≥5% to <50%, ≥50%). Responses are noted at all PD-L1 cutoffs.

Among 35 patients in the PD-L1 negative subgroup in Group 2 (TPS <1%), ORR was 25.7% (9/35 
patients). The samples of the remaining 34 patients were excluded from PD-L1 analysis because the 
slides were expired (>6 months since slide cut date) or because there were an insufficient number of 
cells.

Clinical studies in special populations 
Supportive study 
Supportive efficacy is provided for 6 patients with advanced BCC from Study 1423, which is a completed 
basket dose-finding phase 1 study (FIH). The efficacy data were not pooled or integrated with the Study 
1620 data as the small BCC data set in Study 1423 would not have a meaningful impact on the efficacy 
analyses for Study 1620. 
•  Estimate the complete response (CR) rate by central review 
•  Assess the safety and tolerability of cemiplimab 
•  Assess the PK of cemiplimab (at select sites only) 
•  Assess the immunogenicity of cemiplimab 
The efficacy data were not pooled or integrated with the Study 1620 data as the small BCC data set in 
Study 1423 would not have a meaningful impact on the efficacy analyses for Study 1620. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
LIBTAYO (cemiplimab) 350 mg as an IV infusion over 30 minutes Q3W was first approved in the US on 28 
September 2018 and in the EU on 28 June 2019 for the treatment of patients with metastatic CSCC or 
patients with locally advanced CSCC who are not candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study 1620 is an ongoing phase 2, non-randomized, open-label, 2 group, multicenter pivotal study of 
cemiplimab (REGN2810) monotherapy for patients with locally advanced BCC (Group 2) and metastatic 
BCC (Group 1) after first-line HHI therapy. For group 2, patients must be deemed to have unresectable 
disease and this is defined by any of the following: Lack of response to prior HHI therapy or Response to 
prior HHI therapy, but currently unresectable. The prevalence of such advanced disease is very low and 
hence a confirmatory randomized controlled trial may not be feasible. 
In both groups, the treatment regimen is 350 mg cemiplimab IV Q3W and the patients will receive up to 
twelve 56-day (8-week) treatment cycles for up to 93 weeks of treatment. A total of 132 patients with 
advanced BCC (84 patients with locally advanced BCC, 48 patients with metastatic BCC) are included in 
Assessment report  
EMA/319415/2021 
Page 87/118 
 
 
 
 
 
the Study 1620 FAS but only 28/48 patients with mBCC (in total 112 patients) had enough follow-up time 
to assert any efficacy. Patients were enrolled at clinical sites in North America (N = 27) and the EU (N = 
85). 
In the cemiplimab treated patients the majority had either progression of disease on HHI therapy or were 
intolerant of prior HHI therapy. As many as 71.4% (60/84) of the laBCC patients in Group 2 had 
experienced disease progression on prior HHI, and only 2 patients had SD after 9 months of HHI therapy. 
Patients having progressed after HHI represent a patient population of a high unmet medical need.   
The inclusion/exclusion criteria clearly define a second line patient population but it is though somehow 
controversial that patients with “no better than a stable disease after 9 months on HHI therapy” could be 
enrolled in the study. One could argue that there was not an unmet medical need for these patients. On 
the other hand, subsequent responses were not seen in a patient with SD on HHI after 6 months 
treatment. It is therefore not likely that an eventually subsequent response on cemiplimab could have 
been obtained from the treatment with an HHI.   
Patients excluded from clinical studies are described under 4.4 of the SmPC as patients that had active 
infections, or that were immunocompromised, had a history of autoimmune diseases, ECOG PS ≥2 or a 
history of interstitial lung disease were not included in the main study. A detailed list of patients excluded 
from clinical trials is given in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
The currently applied indication was for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced basal cell 
carcinoma (BCC) previously treated with a hedgehog pathway inhibitor (HHI). However, the CHMP 
considered that the wording should define only the patients with prior unsuccessful treatment with HHI, 
and at the same time, a patient population consistent with the one included in the pivotal Study 1620. 
The wording was revised to include patients who have progressed on or are intolerant to a HHI. 
The primary endpoint (ORR according to central review) is fully acceptable in a second line setting and is 
a clinically relevant endpoint in this cutaneous malignancy. DOR, PFS, CR and OS are important 
secondary endpoints. The MAH has formulated multiple clinically secondary and exploratory endpoints. 
It could be argued that demonstration of direct anti-tumour activity alone would not be considered to 
represent a patient benefit per se if not accompanied by other clinically relevant effects. However, the 
endpoint of ORR could still be acceptable in the advanced BCC, as it is assumed that it isolates the drug 
effect. Further, ORR itself can be considered to provide clinical benefit (even in the absence of 
demonstrated PFS/OS gain) to these advanced BCC patients, with very invasive, disfiguring tumours. 
Therefore, overall, it is acceptable that in this pivotal study, the primary endpoint was ORR and the time 
to event endpoints are not yet mature.   
In total 170 patients were screened for enrolment with 138 patients participating in this study.  
Main reasons for discontinuation was PD and AE. AE were more profound in the laBCC group (15.5% vs 
6.3%). Otherwise, there were no clinically relevant differences between the two treatment groups. 
There were several protocol amendments. The dose of cemiplimab was changed from 250 mg Q3W to 
350 mg Q3W and the length of treatment was extended, but no patients in the study were dosed with 
cemiplimab 250 mg Q3W. 
The number of important protocol deviations were not balanced between the two treatment groups (29 in 
group 2 and 5 in group 1). In group 2 the inclusion criteria were not met in 13 patients while it was the 
case in only 2 patients in group 1. None of these deviations jeopardized the integrity of the data. It is 
acknowledged that the Study 1620 is not a randomized study and therefore the 2 groups would not be 
expected to be balanced. Group 2 enrolled more rapidly than Group 1. Therefore Group 1 was less 
impacted by this imbalance. The imbalance is as expected largely due to confirmation of receipt of 
archival material not being received prior to enrolment for both groups. The patients were enrolled prior

to the establishment of an enrolment checklist that addressed this issue. This shows that in the period of 
initiating the study there has been a logistic problem with the local pathology apartments.  
All patients in the FAS received prior HHI therapy and the reason for discontinuation of HHI is mainly due 
to progression of disease and intolerance to HHI. “No better than SD after 9 months of HHI therapy” is 
the reason in 3/35 in mBCC and 2/84 in laBCC. From a clinical point of view disease characteristics and 
prognosis of patients with stable disease might differ from patients with PD on HHI-therapy, as this is the 
truly second-line population. The indication was revised as discussed above to focus on “patients who 
have progressed on or are intolerant to a HHI.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses  
The effect observed in the laBCC population (ORR 28.6%, (6/28); 95% CI 19.2, 39.5%; 6% CR; and with 
notably long duration of response, i.e. 85.2% for 12 months, 69.7% for 16 months) and a mPFS of 19.3 
months can be considered clinically meaningful, even when pre-specified success criteria for the primary 
endpoint were formally missed in the primary analysis (95% CI for ORR excludes 20%). For 2 laBCC 
patients the responses of SD were subsequently confirmed as PR per ICR at tumour assessment after the 
data cut-off.  
The MAH provided a new data update as of 30 June 2020 during this assessment procedure; the updated 
ORR for the laBCC group is 32.1% (27/84).   
These results are encouraging in a small patient population in the second line setting with limited 
treatment possibilities. 
BOR by ICR with an updated ORR for laBCC patients was 32.1% (27/84). Twenty-one (21) responses 
were PRs and 6 were CRs. This includes the 2 patients who had unconfirmed PRs at the 17 February 2020 
data cut. Both responses are confirmed in the new data cut. An additional responder in this data cut is a 
laBCC patient whose BOR previous to 17 February 2020 was SD. Based on tumour assessments between 
17 February 2020 and 30 June 2020, the patient achieved a confirmed CR first response (CR) on 25 
February 2020 (confirmation response date: 23 April 2020). For two laBCC patients the responses of SD 
were subsequently confirmed as PR per ICR at tumour assessment after the data cut-off.  
Responses in laBCC can develop over a wide and long range of time. Median time to response for laBCC 
was 4.21 months (range: 2.1 to 13.4 months) with evidence that responses deepen over time in the 
spider plots. However, as the responses can develop over a long period of time, clinical benefit can be 
achieved even in patients who do not fulfil response criteria, and no clear cut-off can be defined beyond 
which responses would not be expected, it is acceptable that it can be left to the treating physician to 
decide if continuation of the treatment is warranted. In the SmPC the current recommendation to 
continue treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity applies for the BCC indication too. 
Group 1 is the mBCC cohort for Study 1620 and reached its planned total enrolment of 54 patients as of 
09 Apr 2020 and has been closed for enrolment. However, the MAH has after request from the CHMP 
updated the efficacy data for mBBC patients with a new cut-off date as of 30 June 2020. The median 
duration of follow up for mBCC patients (N = 35) was 8.54 months at this data cut-off. The data show 
that treatment of 35 mBCC patients with cemiplimab resulted in an objective response rate (ORR) of 
28.6%, including 1 patient who had a complete response and 9 patients who had partial responses (PR). 
The response rates in mBCC are comparable and consistent with that seen in laBCC (ORR of 32.1%). The 
mPFS is 6.6 months with an estimated PFS at 12 months of 28.8%. 
Without a randomisation it is not possible to draw any conclusion on the time to event data because of 
underlying/not measured selection bias in this single-arm study. For all patients with advanced BCC the 
mOS was not reached as of data cut-off 30 Jun 2020. The estimated median is unstable due to small 
number of events.

EMA/319415/2021 
Page 89/118 
 
 
 
Duration of Response (DOR) (Investigator Assessment) by Kaplan Meier method has not been reached for 
mBCC patients as of 30 June 2020 data cut-off. The estimated event-free probability was 90% at 6 
months (95% CI: 47.3% to 98.5%). Longer follow-up will eventually be available in the final study 
reports as the MAH is being requested by the CHMP to submit the final CSR for study 1620 (see Annex 
II.D). 
PFS and OS are challenging to assess without a comparator group and are of supportive evidence only. 
For all patients with advanced BCC the mOS was 25.7 months as of data cut-off. The estimated median is 
unstable due to small number of events. The mPFS is 19.3 months for the laBCC group and with the new 
data as of 30 June 2020 cut-off 6.6 months for the mBCC group. The estimated PFS at 12 months was 
28.8%. Median OS was not reached for mBCC patients at time of 30 June 2020 data cutoff. The results 
are encouraging in a second line setting in a patient group with a very poor prognosis and limited 
treatment possibilities but no confirmatory conclusions can be drawn in terms of OS in the absence of a 
comparator group. 
It is notable that the disease control rate (DCR) and durable disease control rate are high, 79.8% and 
59.5% respectively. The DCR and dDCR results observed in Study 1620 provide further evidence of the 
clinical benefit of cemiplimab.  
Biomarker data is only presented for the 50/84 laBCC patients. The remaining 34 patients had an 
unknown PD-L1 status. The best ORR by ICR for the 50 patients is 26.0% and 41.2% for the PD-L1 not 
evaluable group within the laBCC cohort. No biomarker data is available for the mBCC group. Cemiplimab 
appeared active against advanced BCC in all PD-L1 strata. The relationship between PD-L1 status and 
efficacy was analyzed post-hoc in patients with available samples. Based on the limited number of 
patients with tumour samples, clinical activity seems to be observed regardless of tumour PD-L1 
expression status. Thus, the data do not support a restriction of the indication based on the PD-L1 
expression.   
There is a major unmet medical need in this late line treatment, after HHI-therapies and when radiation/ 
surgery is not possible, with no remaining treatment options for these patients. The prevalence of such 
advanced disease is very low and hence a confirmatory randomized controlled trial may not be feasible. 
However, the product has been already licenced and shown to provide benefit in patients with CCSC, 
which is a very similar disease with BCC, with shared lineage with epidermal keratinocytes, providing 
further support and plausibility for efficacy in the currently sought indication. 
The results in the mBCC demonstrated an important benefit in this population, in addition to the laBCC, 
and the CHMP considered that the indication should be revised to reflect this. The final wording of the 
indication included locally advanced or metastatic basal cell carcinoma. 
At the time of this report the primary analysis for the metastatic population has not been completed; the 
data cut for the primary analysis for Group 1 is projected to occur on 20 May 2021, which represents 57 
weeks from cycle 1/day 1 for the 54th patient enrolled in Group 1. Data lock would occur in July 2021. 
The MAH anticipates that the updated CSR for mBCC will be completed in September 2021 and 
committed to provide the primary and final analysis of the mBCC population post-approval (see Annex 
II.D). 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Assessment report  
EMA/319415/2021

The pivotal study 1620 (REGN2810) showed clinically relevant results for Libtayo monotherapy in the 
treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic basal cell carcinoma (laBCC or mBCC) who 
have progressed on or are intolerant to a hedgehog pathway inhibitor (HHI). 
The following measures are considered necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
Submission of the report from clinical study 1620 to further confirm clinical efficacy and safety of 
cemiplimab in patients with mBCC who experienced progression of disease on hedgehog pathway 
inhibitor therapy or were intolerant of prior hedgehog pathway inhibitor therapy.  
Submission of Report on primary analysis in Q1 2022 and submission of the final study report after 36 
months of follow up, in Q2 2024 (see Annex II.D). 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The evaluation of safety for the advanced BCC application is based on data from 3 additional studies of 
cemiplimab that were pooled with study 1620: Study 1423 (FIH for various solid advanced tumours), 
Study 1540 (advanced CSCC), and Study 1624 (advanced NSCLC as first-line therapy). The primary focus 
is on data from the SAF for Safety Pool 1 who included 138 advanced BCC (84 laBCC and 54 mBCC) 
patients who had received at least 1 dose cemiplimab as monotherapy in Study 1620 and Safety Pool 2 
including 816 subjects who also had received at least 1 dose of cemiplimab as monotherapy in Studies 
1620 (138), 1423 (130), 1540 (193) and 1624 (355).

Deaths 
In Study 1620, 6 (4.3%) patients experienced TEAEs resulting in death; 2 had mBCC, and 4 had laBCC.  
The causes of death were as follows: 1 Pneumonia staphylococcal in mBCC patient, and 1 Cachexia, 1 
Brain neoplasm malignant, and 1 Acute kidney injury in patients with laBCC). None of the TEAEs resulting 
in death was considered by the investigator as related to cemiplimab.

Immunogenicity 
As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity with cemiplimab. Immunogenicity 
was assessed by monitoring ADAs to cemiplimab. Samples for ADA assessment were collected prior to 
dosing at several time points. 
Among all patients in the ADA analysis set of Safety Pool 3, 2.2% (18/823) of patients developed 
treatment-emergent antibodies to cemiplimab. Maximum antibody titers were all low with the exception 
of 1 moderate titer. No patient developed NAbs. Persistent antibody responses, defined as having at least 
2 consecutive positive post baseline samples separated by at least 16 weeks, occurred in 0.4% (3/823) of 
patients overall. 
The incidence of treatment-emergent ADA in Safety Pool 1 (Study 1620 in BCC) was 3.2%, with 4 
patients with treatment emergent ADA (0 persistent, 2 transient, and 2 indeterminate treatment-
emergent ADA responses); all had low titers (<1,000). Pre-existing ADA occurred in 4 patients (3.2%). 
No NAb were detected in the patients with a positive response in the ADA assay.  
In the patients who developed anti-cemiplimab antibodies, there was no evidence of altered exposure to 
cemiplimab.  
The presence of ADA was not associated with significant TEAEs or imAEs.  
Post marketing experience 
Cemiplimab is approved in several countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic 
or locally advanced CSCC who are not candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation.  Cumulatively 
up to 27 Mar 2020, a total of 3547 patients have been treated with investigational cemiplimab 
monotherapy, combination therapy, or comparator in multiple clinical trials. 
The international birth date (IBD) for cemiplimab is 28 September 2018 (date of first-ever approval in 
any country). Using the sales data and assuming that all vials sold were administered to patients at the 
approved dose of 350 mg Q3W, the estimated post marketing exposure from the IBD up to 27 March 
2020 is 2576.3 patient-years. 
Since the initial approval of cemiplimab, 2 identified risks (immune-related myositis and solid organ 
transplant rejection) have been confirmed. These risks are part of well-known immune related adverse 
events associated with this class of drug. Review of post marketing safety data did not identify any new 
unexpected safety findings. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The most relevant safety database for this application is the monotherapy patients (Safety Pool 2), 
comprising 816 patients, where 2/3 of patients have received the proposed dosing regimen of 350 mg 
Q3W (n=549). Median duration of exposure in the pivotal Study 1640 is 26.8 weeks for the mBCC group 
and 47.15 weeks for the laBCC group. A comprehensive safety profile of cemiplimab in the proposed dose 
is sufficiently characterized and endorsed. Importantly, however, the number of patients with advanced 
BCC (138 patients) was limited and the study 1620 (pivotal study for BCC) was an open-label single arm 
study. 
According to the SmPC, the safety of cemiplimab has been evaluated in 591 patients with advanced solid 
malignancies including 219 advanced CSCC. Severe and fatal immune-related adverse reactions (irADRs) 
have been observed and these immune-related reactions may involve any organ system. Most of these 
Assessment report  
EMA/319415/2021 
Page 108/118 
 
 
 
 
adverse reactions, including severe reactions, have resolved following initiation of appropriate medical 
therapy or withdrawal of cemiplimab.  
Almost all monotherapy patients had at least one AE (97.1%) and more than a third (45.7%) had high-
grade (≥3grade) AE. Two thirds of the patients had treatment-emergent AEs most frequently fatigue 
(28.3%), diarrhoea (12.3%), pruritus (13.8%) and hypothyroidism (8.7%) in pool 1, and that was 
consistent with the patients in pool 2 in the updated version as of 17 Feb 2020. Thyroiditis can present 
with or without an alteration in thyroid function tests. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism (see 
section 4.4 of the SmPC).  
Adverse events of special interest include immune-related events and the most commonly identified 
overall grade irAEs in pool 1 were hypothyroidism (8.7%), colitis (3.6%), hyperthyroidism (4.3%) and 
arthralgia (4.3%) but ≥grade 3 events rarely occurred. It may be concluded that the AEs, SAEs, and 
irAEs were observed of similar incidence between the groups and no major safety concerns are raised at 
this point although the proportion of patients experiencing serious TEAEs increased with age in Study 
1620 (Safety Pool 1) as well as in Safety Pool 3. 
As of the data cut-off, 4.3% (6/138) of patients in Study 1620 experienced TEAEs resulting in death. 
According to the narratives the 3/4 patients had substantial co-morbidities. Four additional patients were 
noted to have died during the on-study period due to disease progression; the relevant narratives have 
been updated. 
Serious TEAEs as well as treatment discontinuations are clearly more common in the elderly population 
than in the younger patients (24,5% vs 57.6% and 5,4% vs 21,2% respectively). Also, SAEs related to 
cemiplimab treatment are more common in the elderly (5,9% in patients <65 years and 21,2% in 
patients ≥85 years). The SmPC section 5.1 reflects the higher frequency of serious adverse events and 
discontinuations due to adverse events in patients 65 years and older compared with patients aged less 
than 65 years.  
Patients in the monotherapy pool (Pool 2, n=441) were presented according to mild, moderate and 
severe renal impairment; 307 patients had mild and 134 patients had moderate renal impairment. Only 6 
patients with severe renal impairment were treated with monotherapy cemiplimab. Review of safety data 
in these patients did not identify any significant differences compared to patients with normal renal 
function. In the monotherapy pool (Pool 2), a total of 21 patients with mild (18 patients) and moderate (3 
patients) hepatic impairment were treated with cemiplimab. Here again a review of safety data in these 
patients did not identify any significant differences compared to patients with normal hepatic function. 
The existing text in the SmPC regarding patients with renal and hepatic impairment is adequate. 
Most treatment discontinuations in the BCC group were due to gastrointestinal, endocrine and nervous 
system disorders but the numbers are very small (2-4 patients in each disorder). 19.6% of the patients in 
the BCC group (pool 1) discontinued the treatment. Based on data presented, it can be concluded, that 
the overall frequency of TEAEs, severe TEAS of grade 3/4/5 and serious TEAEs in the laBCC group was 
roughly similar to other patients treated with cemiplimab, especially when compared to study 1540 (193 
patients with CSCC). However, discontinuations due to TEAEs were more common in laBCC patients than 
in any other patient group treated with cemiplimab. The frequency of discontinuations due to TEAEs was 
17,9% in laBCC patients and 6,5%, 7,8% and 6,5% in studies 1423, 1540 and 1624 respectively. The 
frequency of adverse events resulting in treatment discontinuation was higher in the laBCC group than in 
mBCC group, 17.9% and 7.4% respectively. The most common reason for discontinuations of treatment 
in the laBCC group were gastrointestinal disorders including colitis, autoimmune colitis and enterocolitis.  
There seems not to be any differences between pool 1 and pool 2. However, again the numbers are small 
making a comparison difficult.

EMA/319415/2021

Following the CHMP request to use Pool 2 in the ADR table in section 4.8 of the SmPC, the table was 
revised to include patients treated with cemiplimab monotherapy (n=810 in total), which included BCC 
safety data from the Feb 2020 data cut (n=132, laBCC: n=84 and mBCC: n=48). Inclusion of June 2020 
data resulted in 6 additional mBCC patients so n=816 as pooled safety data. The ADR table in section 4.8 
was updated in both NSCLC and BCC variations for consistency. (see section 4.8 of the SmPC).  
The incidence of anti-cemiplimab antibodies (ADAs) in patients with advanced BCC treated with 
cemiplimab 350 mg Q3W was 3.2%. Of the patients who developed treatment-emergent antibodies to 
cemiplimab, none developed NAbs. Thus, cemiplimab had low immunogenicity potential, consistent with 
patients with advanced CSCC. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of cemiplimab is as expected for a PD-1 inhibitor, and considering the elderly patient 
population. There are no new safety findings nor any major concerns.  
The relevant SmPC Sections have been revised, to reflect the safety profile of pool 2 and the safety in 
relation to age of patients treated with cemiplimab monotherapy. Further safety data will be submitted in 
the context of the Annex II.D PAES (see clinical efficacy section) i.e. submission of the final CSR for study 
1620.  
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
 Disease or condition 
Treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic basal cell carcinoma (laBCC or mBCC) 
who have progressed on or are intolerant to a hedgehog pathway inhibitor (HHI). 
 Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Advanced BCC is a serious condition that includes potentially life-threatening disease for metastatic 
patients and persistent invasive and disfiguring tumours for patients with locally advanced BCC. Despite 
the practice-changing efficacy observed with the HHIs vismodegib and sonidegib for first-line therapy for 
advanced BCC, the limitations of HHIs are that approximately half of patients do not experience objective 
responses, most responses are partial, and side effect profiles of these agents can create difficulties for 
long-term therapy. 
For advanced BCC patients (laBCC+mBCC), who no longer benefit from first-line HHI therapy, there are 
no approved or efficacious second-line therapies. There is major unmet medical need in this late line 
treatment, after HHI-therapies and when radiation/ surgery is not possible, with no remaining treatment 
options for these patients.  
 Main clinical studies 
The pivotal study for this application regarding efficacy and safety is the 1620 (REGN2810) study, which 
is an ongoing, international, multicentre, non-randomized, open-label, two-group phase 2 study of 
cemiplimab monotherapy for patients with mBCC and laBCC, and who have discontinued prior HHI 
therapy due to disease progression, no better than stable disease after 9 months, or intolerance. As of 
the data cut-off date (30 Jun 2020), there were 138 patients enrolled in the study (54 in the mBCC group 
and 84 in the laBCC group).  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Primary results of the laBCC group and interim results and updated efficacy results of the mBCC group 
from the pivotal Study 1620 (REGN2810) in the efficacy target population showed an ORR per ICR-
assessed (RECIST 1.1) of 32.1% in the laBCC group and 28.6% in the mBCC group. 
The disease control rate in the laBCC group was 79.8% (95%CI 69.6, 87.7), and durable disease control 
rate 59.5% (95% CI 48.3, 70.1). 
The K-M estimated percentages of responses ongoing in patients with locally advanced BCC at 6 months 
and 12 months per ICR were 90.9% (95% CI: 68.3%, 97.6%) and 85.2% (95% CI: 60.5%, 95.0), 
respectively. For the mBCC group at 6 months it was 90%. 
For all patients with advanced BCC the mOS was 25.7 months as of data cut-off. The estimated median is 
unstable due to small number of events. The mPFS is 19.3 months for the laBCC group and 6.6 months 
for the mBCC group which is clinically meaningful considering that this is a second line setting in a patient 
group with a very poor prognosis and limited treatment options.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The efficacy of cemiplimab in mBCC is based on interim data on a limited number of patients from a non-
randomised, open-label study. The data cut for the primary analysis for Group 1 is projected to occur on 
20 May 2021, which represents 57 weeks from cycle 1/day 1 for the 54th patient enrolled in Group 1. 
Data lock would occur in July 2021. The MAH anticipates that the updated CSR for mBCC will be 
completed in September 2021 and committed to provide the primary and final analysis of the mBCC 
population from study 1620post-approval (see Annex II.D). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Most patients in study 1620 (97,1%) had at least one AE and 45,7% had high-grade events (≥3 grade). 
The latter was distributed with 35.3% in the mBCC group and 52.4% in the laBCC group and this is 
probably because of the longer treatment duration in the laBCC group. In pool 2 it was respectively 
93.3% and 41.1%. Most common high-grade AE in the BCC group were colitis (2.9%), fatigue 1.4%) and 
asthenia (1.4%). 
Adverse events of special interest included immune-related AEs (irAEs) and were reported as identified 
events (required steroids or were endocrinopathies) and overall grade irAEs occurred frequently in 
approximately a quarter of the patients but ≥grade 3 events rarely occurred (11.6% and 6.5% in pool 1 
and 2 respectively). 
Serious adverse events were common during treatment (any grades 32.6% in pool 1 and 30.0% in pool 
2) and most often related to infections (13.6% in pool 1 and 11.1% in pool 2), again this may due to the 
underlying disease and the elderly patient population. 
Most treatment discontinuations in the BCC group were due to gastrointestinal, endocrine and nervous 
system disorders. 19.6% of the patients in the BCC group (pool 1) discontinued the treatment. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
In the BCC group the numbers in each disorder concerning discontinuation are very small (2-4 patients in 
each disorders). Safety findings from other safety pools (Pool 2 and Pool 3) were used to provide 
supportive information particularly concerning imAEs, but the Pool 2 (monotherapy pool) includes even 
patients with other than existing or sought indications i.e. off-label indications and patients in Pool 3 
(used primary to discuss imAEs) have also received combination treatments and an essential part of other 
patients have received different dosing regimen (3 mg/kg cemiplimab Q2W IV), so there are several 
confounding factors in these safety evaluations. 
Further safety data, the primary analysis of group 1, as well as a 18 months follow up from study 1620 
will be submitted for CHMP review post authorisation (see Annex II.D).

 Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Advanced BCC is a serious condition and despite the efficacy observed with the HHIs vismodegib and 
sonidegib for first line therapy, the limitations of HHIs are that approximately half of patients do not 
experience objective responses and the side effect profiles can create difficulties for long-term therapy. 
There is currently no approved treatment for these patients in the second-line, thus there is an unmet 
medical need in this setting. 
There is a major unmet medical need in this late line treatment, after HHI-therapies and when radiation/ 
surgery is not possible, with no remaining treatment options for these patients. The prevalence of such 
advanced disease is very low and hence a confirmatory randomized controlled trial may not be feasible. 
Although cemiplimab is explored in a non-randomized study without a comparator the observed ORR of 
28.6-32.1% and the PFS of 6.6-19.3 months in the mBCC and laBCC group respectively, are considered 
clinically meaningful in this palliative setting. 
Further, the product has been already licenced and shown to provide benefit in patients with CCSC, which 
is a very similar disease with BCC, with shared lineage with epidermal keratinocytes, providing further 
support and plausibility for efficacy in the currently sought indication.

 Balance of benefits and risks 
The observed clinical benefit in terms of ORR and PFS in the mBCC and laBCC group respectively, 
outweighs the risks which are considered manageable in this condition. 
 Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Libtayo is positive provided the final CSR for the mBCC cohort is submitted post 
authorisation. 
The following measures are considered necessary to address issues related to efficacy and safety: 
Submission of the report from clinical study 1620 to further confirm clinical efficacy and safety of 
cemiplimab in patients with mBCC who experienced progression of disease on hedgehog pathway 
inhibitor therapy or were intolerant of prior hedgehog pathway inhibitor therapy.  
Submission of Report on primary analysis: Q1 2022; Submission of Final report after 36 months of follow 
up: Q2 2024

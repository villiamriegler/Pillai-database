Omalizumab (Xolair) is a recombinant DNA-derived humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal 
antibody that selectively binds to IgE. Omalizumab is designed to treat IgE-mediated disease by 
reducing the concentration of free IgE in blood and in tissue. Omalizumab selectively binds to human 
IgE at the same site as the high affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI), thereby reducing surface IgE on 
basophils and mast cells and reducing basophil and mast cell triggered Type 2 inflammation. 
Omalizumab is currently approved for the treatment of allergic asthma in children (≥ 6 years), 
adolescents and adults, and for the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) in adolescents (≥ 
12 years) and adults. 
The current variation application seeks to extend the use of omalizumab for the treatment of nasal 
polyps in adult patients who have inadequate response to intranasal corticosteroids. The proposed 
posology is based on a dosing table determined by the baseline IgE level and body weight of each 
patient as currently approved in the EU for the allergic asthma indication for Xolair.  
Nasal polyps occur in a subset of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). CRSwith nasal polyposis 
(CRSwNP) is a predominantly adult disease, with the average age of onset being 42 years and the 
typical age ranging from 40 and 60 years. Data suggest that while relatively common in adults, 
CRSwNP is uncommon in children. Overall, the reported relevance of nasal polyps is consistent with 
limited existing epidemiology studies, globally with a range between 2.1% - 2.7%. 
CRSwNP is associated both with reduced quality of life (QoL) as well as significant morbidity, including 
asthma, which can be severe and refractory, particularly in those patients with aspirin exacerbated 
respiratory disease (AERD). Patients with CRSwNP and most patients with asthma share a common 
IgE-mediated Type 2 inflammatory response which is characterized by elevated levels of interleukins 4 
EMA/404869/2020  
Page 7/78 
 
  
 
 
(IL-4), IL-5, IL-13, eosinophils, type 2 T helper (Th2) cells and type 2 innate lymphoid cells. In 
addition, locally produced IgE (often against Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxins) can contribute to the 
inflammation in CRSwNP, which in particular is associated with comorbid asthma. Because of the 
common Type 2 inflammatory disease between asthma and CRSwNP, approximately 20% to 40% of 
patients with asthma have CRSwNP, particularly those with AERD. Conversely, a significant proportion 
of patients with CRSwNP (20% - 70%) have symptoms of asthma. Therefore, there appears to be a 
premorbid relationship between asthma and CRSwNP, with the diagnosis of asthma often occurring 
prior to that of nasal polyposis. 
Intranasal and systemic/oral corticosteroids remain the mainstay of treatment of CRSwNP, but many 
patients fail to achieve complete therapeutic benefit with these medications and resort to Functional 
Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS) and other complex sinus surgery. Although FESS and intranasal and 
oral corticosteroids are useful and often effective in reducing the size of nasal polyps and associated 
symptoms, many patients do not respond sufficiently and/or polyps return rapidly after medication 
withdrawal or within months or years following surgery. In September 2019, dupilumab was approved  
as an add-on maintenance treatment in adults with severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis 
(CRSwNP) who previously failed or are intolerant or contraindicated to systemic corticosteroids and/or 
surgery; Dupilumab was also approved to reduce the need for surgery and systemic corticosteroid use 
in adult patients with inadequately controlled severe CRSwNP. Dupilumab is a recombinant human 
IgG4-monoclonal antibody which inhibits interleukin-4- and interleukin-13 signalling. IL-4 and IL-13 
are important in the signalling pathway for type 2-inflammation, which is associated with atopic 
dermatitis, asthma and CRSwNP. 
There has been a number of clinical studies examining the effect of omalizumab on nasal polyps, 
showing benefits of omalizumab. To support this extension of indication, two pivotal phase III-studies 
were conducted and presented in this application (studies GA39688 and GA39855).  
The terms CRSwNP, nasal polyposis, and nasal polyps have been used interchangeably and are 
referred to as nasal polyps hereafter in the assessment report. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The MAH provided a justification for not submitting any environmental risk assessment (ERA) studies 
based on the fact that omalizumab is a protein and therefore unlikely to pose a significant risk to the 
environment which in accordance with the CHMP guideline on the environmental risk assessment 
EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2.  
2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted. The safety of omalizumab has previously been studied 
in cynomolgus monkey, since omalizumab binds to cynomolgus and human IgE with similar affinity. No 
apparent toxicity was seen. 
No ERA has been conducted to support this application. This is acceptable considering that omalizumab 
is a protein and it is therefore unlikely to be stable or remain biologically active in the environment and 
pose a risk to the environment even when adding a new therapeutic indication.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The purpose of the pharmacokinetics (PK) analysis was to assess whether the PK of omalizumab and 
its effect on the pharmacodynamics (PD), in terms of total IgE and free IgE, in nasal polyps were 
consistent with those in allergic asthma, and to explore the impact of existing and additional covariates 
on omalizumab PK and IgE kinetics in nasal polyps. 
Bodyweight and total IgE at (Day -35) informed omalizumab dosing and dosing frequency (Table 1), 
similarly with the approach used for the treatment of allergic asthma.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Omalizumab is a humanized anti-IgE recombinant monoclonal antibody approved to treat allergic 
asthma in children (≥ 6 years), adolescents and adults and chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) in 
adults and adolescents (≥ 12 years).  
In allergic asthma, omalizumab binds to IgE and prevents the binding of IgE to the FcεRI on the 
surface of mast cells and basophils. Reduction in surface-bound IgE on the FcεRI-bearing cells limits 
the release of mediators in the allergic response. This, in turn, results in down regulation of FcεRI 
expression on basophils and mast cells (high-affinity IgE-receptors).  
In CSU, the mode of action is less well understood. The observation that many patients with CSU 
improve with omalizumab implies that there may be an abnormal IgE present, which recognizes an 
unknown antigen and activates mast cells and basophils. However, the mechanism by which these 
effects of omalizumab result in an improvement of chronic idiopathic urticaria symptoms is unknown. 
As for the effect of omalizumab on IgE in CRSwNP, the MAH applies a similar PK/PD model as in 
allergic asthma. To some extent, allergic asthma and nasal polyps overlap in affected patients and 
share a similar inflammatory pathway (type 2 inflammation).  
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
Population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis (omalizumab PK-IgE model) 
Data 
Omalizumab dose was based on a dosing table that provided at least 0.016 mg/kg for every IU/mL of 
IgE, within a 4-week interval. 
During both studies included in this application, studies GA39688 and GA39855, single blood samples 
for PK, total IgE and free IgE were drawn prior to drug administration on Days 1, 112 (Week 16), 168 
(Week 28), at follow-up (Day 196, Week 28) and in case of unplanned termination of dosing or early 
termination. An additional assessment of total IgE was performed at screening (Day -35) in order to 
inform omalizumab dosing and dosing frequency. In the dataset, the baseline IgE values ranged from 
20-1470 IU/mL. 
Population PK/PD model 
The version of the model published by Honma and colleagues (2016) formed the basis for this analysis 
(a schematic of the basic model structure is provided in Figure 1). Parameter estimates for the 
published model appear below in Table 3. A large number of covariate relationships with model 
parameters were also described by the authors – these appear in Table 4. 
Since the omalizumab and IgE concentration data available from the clinical studies in the current 
analysis consisted solely of pre-dose troughs, refitting the model to the data was not possible. Instead, 
the model was evaluated for applicability with respect to the nasal polyps indication and population. 
The Honma model describing omalizumab and free IgE and total IgE concentration over time was 
modified slightly to accommodate the lack of certain covariates in the nasal polyps dataset (terms 
describing age under 12 years and Japanese ethnicity, specifically, were removed), and used to 
EMA/404869/2020  
Page 12/78 
 
  
 
 
simulate 1000 new datasets using the design of the data obtained from studies GA39688 and GA39855 
(doses, individual covariate profiles, and observation times).  
The Honma model was subsequently used to generate empirical Bayes estimates of model parameters 
for all individuals in the nasal polyps dataset (by running the model against the data with MAXEVAL set 
to 0 in NONMEM, ensuring no actual model fits were performed). These were compared with the 
expected values from the Honma model in the same way as the individual observations above. 
Standard continuous-data goodness of fit plots was applied for the assessment of model adequacy. 
Overprediction of omalizumab concentration at the medians of the bins centred on 112 days and 168 
days was 13.9 % and 12.0 %, respectively

kD were such that covariate-random effect trends were not considered trustworthy.

Exposure-response modelling 
Methods 
The objective was to use available PK and free IgE observations at Week 24 from patients with nasal 
polyps and graphically explore the omalizumab exposure-response and the free IgE-response 
relationships for the efficacy endpoints of absolute change from baseline at Week 24 in nasal polyps 
score (NPS), in average daily nasal congestion score (NCS), in average daily total nasal symptom score 
(TNSS), and in patient-reported health- related quality of life (HRQoL) as assessed by the total Sino-
Nasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22). A graphical comparison with corresponding observed omalizumab 
and free IgE concentrations at Week 24 and Covariates of interest (study, dose regimen/group, 
baseline age, baseline body weight, baseline body mass index [BMI], sex, race, baseline IgE, 
comorbidity and baseline score values) was also done.  
Results 
Using the baseline body weight- and total IgE-based omalizumab dosing table, free IgE suppression at 
week 24 in nasal polyps studies (GA39688 and GA39855) was achieved with 119 (93.0%) of the 
subjects on active treatment and with evaluable free IgE concentrations reaching free IgE levels of 
below 50 ng/mL and 95 subjects (74.2%) reaching free IgE levels of below 25 ng/mL. The relationship 
between omalizumab concentration and free IgE concentration at week 24 is shown in (Figure 3).

Figure 3. Relationship between total omalizumab concentration and free IgE concentration at week 24, 
by dose/regimen group 
There was no clear or consistent correlation between omalizumab concentration and change from 
baseline NCS, NPS, TNSS and SNOT-22 responses observed at Week 24 in actively-treated subjects in 
the tested dose range (150-600 mg every 2 or 4 weeks) (Figure 4). A positive association between 
omalizumab concentration and NPS response was observed with the lowest concentration tertile group 
showing a lower NPS response than the other two tertile groups. While the possibility that these 
patients would have an improved response with a higher dosing regimen cannot be excluded, the trend 
of lower responses being observed in the first exposure tertile was not observed in the other efficacy 
endpoints (NCS, TNSS, and SNOT-22) that were evaluated.  
Graphical covariate analyses showed that baseline scores for all four efficacy endpoints had clear or 
slight correlations with their corresponding efficacy endpoint responses, with higher baseline scores 
being associated with larger changes from baseline at Week 24. The other covariates studied showed 
no clear relationships with efficacy responses, baseline IgE or free IgE-response relationships.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Bioanalysis 
The validation of assays for determination of total serum concentrations of omalizumab, free IgE 
serum levels and total lgE antibodies have been assessed in a previous submission (MAH Reports NBX-
EMA/404869/2020  
Page 23/78 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
RS602700, NBX-RS602700A and NBX-RS630172; EMEA/H/C/000606/II/48). For this variation, the 
MAH has not performed parallelism investigation for the omalizumab concentration, which is required 
according to the guideline on bioanalytical method validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009). 
Nevertheless, CHMP considered that this issue will not be further pursued based on the totality of the 
submitted data. 
Further, the anti-drug antibody (ADA) method has a too low drug tolerance and therefore, ADA 
analysis was not conducted during the blinded treatment period. It remains unclear why the MAH has 
not developed an improved assay, nevertheless, the results will be available when study WA40169 is 
completed. Given the low immunogenicity in other indications, CHMP considered that it is acceptable to 
submit these missing data at a later stage. The MAH is therefore expected to submit the ADA-results 
with the final WA40169 study report.  
Mechanism of action 
Allergic asthma and nasal polyposis share a common IgE-mediated type 2 inflammatory response. In 
addition, locally produced IgE, often against Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxins, is associated with 
local inflammation in CRSwNP and, in particular, with comorbid asthma. CSU on the other hand has a 
less understood mechanism of disease and thus of omalizumab.  
Population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model 
The purpose of the population PK/PD analysis was to assess whether the PK of omalizumab and its 
effect on the PD (in terms of total IgE and free IgE) in nasal polyps were consistent with those in 
allergic asthma, and to explore the impact of existing and additional covariates on omalizumab 
pharmacokinetics and IgE kinetics in nasal polyps.  
The Honma model was used, there the covariate model is very complex with all the covariates 
included. It is unclear why body weight and BMI are included in the model, as these are correlated. 
Doses are based on body weight and IgE, therefore it is assumed that the rest of the covariates are 
clinically insignificant. While it would have been of interest to see how a simpler model (without 
correlated covariates or covariates that have no significant clinical impact) performs, the doses 
proposed are well established and known to be safe. Justification of the selected model will not be 
pursued. It has been previously established that the factors affecting apparent clearance (CLx/F) of 
omalizumab include the processes of IgG clearance processes, clearance via specific binding and 
complex formation with its target ligand, IgE, as well as body weight. Body weight and baseline IgE 
levels are also the factors that the dose is adjusted on. 
The model parameters were not re-estimated. Empirical Bayes estimates were generated, and 
standard diagnostic plots were produced to assess whether the pharmacokinetics of omalizumab and 
its effect on the pharmacodynamics in nasal polyps were consistent with those in asthma. While only 
few pre-dose samples were available for this analysis, the PK and PD effect of omalizumab does not 
appear to be different in the new population. Statistical shrinkage was relatively high (>35%) for all 
parameters except CLX/F, CLC/F and RE. Upon request by CHMP, the MAH provided the requested 
plots, updated the plot with the error and submitted additional plots for free IgE stratified by treatment 
(150 mg Q4W, 300 mg Q4W, and the other doses). It appears that it is mainly data from study 
GA39688 that are overpredicted. The free IgE concentration appears to be adequately predicted. 
Exposure-response 
No clear or consistent correlation between baseline NCS, NPS, TNSS and SNOT-22 and baseline IgE 
can be observed. No clear relationship between change from baseline to week 24 NCS, NPS, TNSS and 
SNOT-22 and baseline IgE can be observed either. Using the proposed posology (based on weight and 
baseline IgE), free IgE suppression at 24 weeks was achieved in 93.0% of the subjects on active 
EMA/404869/2020  
Page 24/78 
 
  
 
 
treatment. The exposure-response analysis consisted of a graphical comparison of the efficacy 
endpoints as absolute change from baseline at Week 24 in NPS, NCS, TNSS and SNOT-22 versus 
tertials of concentration and free IgE. A slight positive trend between omalizumab concentration and 
NPS response is observed with the lowest concentration tertile group, however, a clear trend between 
the week 24 omalizumab concentration, or free IgE, and the change from baseline in efficacy 
endpoints is not observed. 
Overall, it was considered by CHMP that the PK and PD effect of omalizumab does not appear to be 
different in the new population. This has been adequately reflected in section 5.2 of the SmPC. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics effect of omalizumab has been adequately characterised 
and does not appear to be different in subjects with nasal polyps compared to subjects with allergic 
asthma. The proposed posology based on body weight and IgE level is considered to be adequate to 
support the use of omalizumab in nasal polyps.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
In this variation application, two Phase-III, randomized, multi-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
clinical trials of omalizumab in patients with nasal polyps are presented by the MAH. Studies GA39688 
and GA39855 are completed pivotal, replicate studies which have identical study design. Patients who 
completed the double-blind treatment period of either study GA39688 or study GA39855, could enrol 
in study WA40169, an open label extension (OLE) study, which is currently ongoing. No efficacy data 
from study WA40169 has been submitted initially however, supportive safety data from an interim 
analysis were submitted and are discussed in the safety section 2.5. 
There is a Guideline on the clinical development of medicinal products for the treatment of allergic 
rhino-conjunctivitis (CHMP/EWP/2455/02), however there is no guideline on medicinal products for 
nasal polyposis currently available. Nevertheless, there is a European position paper on rhinosinusitis 
and nasal polyps which can provide some guidance for the current application (EPOS 2012).  
CHMP scientific advice (SA) was sought in 2017 (EMEA/H/SA/45/4/2017/III). There were concerns 
about the posology of choice and the MAH was recommended to conduct an exploratory proof-of-
concept and dose-finding study, which has not been done. Comments about adherence to this SA are 
provided in this report. 
2.4.1.  Dose response studies 
A series of studies for nasal polyps using baseline IgE and body weight-based posology has been 
presented by the MAH as proof-of-concept. Based on the results from these studies, the EU posology 
for allergic asthma was adopted for the nasal polyp phase 3 studies. Since the Phase-III studies were 
to be conducted in adult patients and nasal polyps rarely occurs in patients less than 18 years of age, 
the posology of omalizumab used in these two nasal polyp studies was adopted from the allergic 
asthma dosing table by excluding cells of which the body weight is less than 30 kg. 
A short summary of studies: 
• 
In 2013, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study for 16 weeks in 24 patients with 
nasal polyps and comorbid asthma showed a reduction from baseline in total nasal endoscopic 
polyp score in the omalizumab arm (-2.67, p=0.001) but not in the placebo arm (-0.12, 
EMA/404869/2020  
Page 25/78 
 
  
 
 
p=0.99). In addition, it was claimed that omalizumab treatment reduced symptom scores and 
improved health related quality of life scores. 
•  A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study from 2010, with 14 patients, of whom 12 
had nasal polyposis, showed, according to the MAH, improvement in the omalizumab group 
compared to none in the placebo group but the authors concluded that IgE plays at most a 
small role in the mucosal inflammation of chronic rhinosinusitis. 
•  A retrospective case control study of totally 8 patients suggested that omalizumab may be 
effective in the treatment of nasal polyposis.  
•  A case series from 2011 of 19 patients who were treated with omalizumab for severe asthma 
associated with nasal polyps, the size of the nasal polyps and the use of intranasal 
corticosteroids were reduced compared to baseline at follow-up (range 15-28 months). 
•  A prospective study, published in 2013, 6 patients with severe asthma and chronic 
rhinosinusitis with eosinophilic enriched nasal polyps were treated with omalizumab for 16 
weeks. There was an improvement at 16 weeks compared to baseline in SNOT-20, symptoms 
of nasal blockage and dysosmia, sinus CT scores using the Lund-Mackay system and Asthma 
Control Questionnaire scores. Nasal polyp size was reduced in 4 of the 6 patients. 
• 
In 2018, a prospective study compared omalizumab (N = 13) to FESS with polypectomy (N = 
24) in the treatment of nasal polyps with comorbid severe allergic asthma, examining the 
outcome of SNOT-22 improvement 4 and 16 weeks after treatment initiation. The authors 
concluded that “the improvement seen with omalizumab approached the treatment efficacy as 
assessed by the SNOT-22 score recorded after surgery”. 
2.4.2.  Main studies 
The efficacy of omalizumab in the treatment of patients with nasal polyps who have inadequate 
response to intranasal corticosteroids (INC) is supported by two pivotal replicate studies i.e. study 
GA39688 and study GA39855. 
Methods 
Studies GA39688 and GA39855 were replicate Phase-III, randomized, multi-centre, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, clinical studies that were conducted in parallel with identical study designs. They 
were conducted concurrently across different sites in 15 countries across Europe and North America. 
Each study was designed to enrol approximately 120 adult patients with nasal polyps who had an 
inadequate response to standard of care treatments (daily treatment with intranasal corticosteroid 
therapy). 
Study participants 
To ensure that the patient population recruited across sites in North America, Eastern and Western 
Europe were similar in their baseline disease characteristics and standard of care therapies, sites were 
selected after a detailed feasibility assessment and review of their facilities and treatment practices. 
Furthermore, both pivotal studies required patients to be on a daily standard of care medication, 
mometasone intranasal corticosteroid, for ≥ 4 weeks prior to the first screening visit and during the 5-
week run-period prior to potential randomization.

Treatments 
Both studies consisted of a 5-week screening/run-in period, a 24-week placebo-controlled treatment 
period, and a 4-week safety follow-up period (Figure 6). 
The 5-week screening/run-in period included two visits, at which patients underwent video endoscopy 
to quantify the size of the polyps and to assign an NPS prior to baseline. 
Figure 6. Study design (studies GA39688 and GA39855)  
1°EP = co-primary end point; Q2W = every 2 weeks; Q4W = every 4 weeks; SFU = safety follow-up; wk = week. 
Note: All patients were treated during the entire study with intranasal corticosteroids (mometasone nasal spray) as 
background therapy. 
Study drug dosing started on the day of randomization (Day 1, Week 0) and was repeated every 2 or 4 
weeks (depending on the patient’s IgE value and body weight at Screening) during the 24-week 
placebo-controlled treatment period. Patients remained on stable doses of intranasal corticosteroids 
therapy (mometasone nasal spray 200 μg bid) for the entire treatment period. Patients deemed by the 
investigator to be intolerant to a bid regimen of mometasone remained on a stable dosage of 
mometasone 200 microgram once a day. 
After the treatment period, patients were followed for an additional 4 weeks, unless they enrolled into 
the open-label extension study WA40169 at Week 24. Patients who discontinued study drug during the 
treatment period continued the planned study assessments through Week 24 and completed a 4-week 
safety follow-up period. Patients who were unwilling or unable to continue with the planned 
assessments in the treatment period, completed a dosing termination visit and entered a 4-week 
safety follow-up period. Patients who required sinus surgery or required two or more courses of 
treatment with systemic corticosteroids for ≥ 3 consecutive days discontinued study drug but 
continued in the study with assessments. 
Objectives 
 Primary and secondary efficacy objectives: 
• 
To evaluate the efficacy of omalizumab compared with placebo 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Co-Primary endpoints:

•  Change from baseline at Week 24 in NPS 
•  Change from baseline at Week 24 in average daily NCS 
Nasal polyp score is decided with intranasal endoscopy and right and left sides are assessed separately 
on a scale from 0 to 4 (total maximum 8).  
Nasal congestion score (0 to 3) is based on daily patient reports using the mean value of the last 7 
days.  
Secondary endpoints: 
For the EU application, a smaller set of secondary endpoints (Table 5), with a sequential order different 
from the general sequential testing order (FDA testing scheme) was used. Hypothesis 8, as a 
secondary endpoint for EU application, was analysed using pooled data.  
TNSS grades four symptoms, sneezing, congestion, itching and rhinorrhoea. Each symptom is graded 
from 0-3 (3 being the worst). 
SNOT-22 (0-110 points) is a validated questionnaire of disease specific, quality of life related measures 
of sinonasal function which has been validated to show a MCID of 8.9 or more. Seven or lower is 
considered normal.  
UPSIT is a test for smell identification to test the function of an individual's olfactory system with the 
worst being 0 and the best being 40.  
These scores were patient reported.  
Table 5 Secondary endpoints for EU application 
Sample size 
A planned total of 120 patients were to be enrolled. The sample size of 120 patients (102 patients 
divided by 0.85 assuming a 15% early withdrawal rate) provided at least 85% power to independently 
detect both a 0.56-point difference between treatment groups in change from baseline at Week 24 in 
the average daily NCS (assuming standard deviation [SD]=0.75)  and a 1.50-point difference between 
treatment groups in change from baseline at Week 24 in NPS (assuming SD=2.0). The sample size 
was calculated using East, Version 6.2, using two-sample Student t-test with equal variances.  
EMA/404869/2020  
Page 30/78 
 
  
 
 
 
The assumed test is two-sided with α = 0.05 and the randomization ratio is 1:1. The standard 
deviations (SDs) assumed for change from baseline at Week 24 in NCS and NPS were 0.83 and 2.2, 
respectively.  
The sample size of n = 102 patients will provide approximately 92% power to detect a 0.56-point 
treatment group difference in change from baseline at Week 24 in NCS (SD = 0.83) and approximately 
93% power to detect a 1.50-point treatment group difference in change from baseline at Week 24 in 
NPS (SD = 2.2), for an overall power of approximately 85% (0.93 × 0.92 > 0.85). This sample size of 
n = 102 patients was inflated to n = 120 to maintain power after an assumed 15% early withdrawal 
rate. 
Randomisation 
On Day 1 (Week 0), patients were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive double-blind treatment 
with omalizumab or placebo. Randomization was stratified by comorbid asthma and aspirin sensitivity 
status at baseline (asthma with aspirin sensitivity, asthma without aspirin sensitivity, and non-asthma 
regardless of aspirin sensitivity) and geographic region (North America, ex-North America). 
Blinding (masking) 
The studies were double-blinded. The patients, the designated evaluating physician(s) and study 
nurses, the central image readers, and the Sponsor and their agents were blinded to treatment 
assignment throughout the study. To minimize risk of potential bias arising from access to laboratory 
results that could potentially unblind treatment assignments (e.g., free IgE levels), access to these 
results were restricted to the site and the sponsor until study completion. Treatment assignment may 
be unblinded to the personnel analysing the data from the treatment period when all data through 
Week 24 are in the database and the data have been cleaned and verified. 
Study drug supplies were shipped blinded to each site. To minimize the risk of potential bias, study site 
personnel who are responsible for reconstituting and/or administering study drug will not be permitted 
to conduct any safety or efficacy evaluations. Each centre will identify an individual (e.g., pharmacist) 
responsible for the reconstitution procedures. This individual will prepare the study drug for each 
patient prior to administration. An individual not involved with evaluating the patient must be identified 
to administer the study drug. 
Statistical methods 
The analysis of data from the 24-week treatment period were performed after all patients had either 
completed the Week 24 visit or discontinued from the treatment period prematurely, and all data from 
the treatment period are in the database and had been cleaned and verified. Patients who discontinued 
early were not replaced. 
The analysis of complete data from the study, including data from the safety follow-up period, were 
performed when all patients have either discontinued the study early or completed the safety follow-up 
period, all data from the study are in the database, and the database is cleaned and locked. 
There are two distinct and equally important estimand of interest in this trial. The first estimand is the 
treatment group difference in mean change from baseline at Week 24 in NPS in patients with CRSwNP, 
where the need for rescue medication, nasal polypectomy or study drug discontinuation is accounted 
for as an unfavourable (worst) outcome. The second estimand is the treatment group difference in 
mean change from baseline at Week 24 in the average daily NCS in patients with CRSwNP, where the 
EMA/404869/2020  
Page 31/78 
 
  
 
 
need for rescue medication, nasal polypectomy or study drug discontinuation is accounted for as an 
unfavourable (worst) outcome.  
Three analysis sets were defined:  
• 
• 
• 
The full-analysis set (FAS)included all randomized patients grouped according to the treatment 
assigned at randomization. 
The pooled full-analysis set (PFAS) included all randomized patients in both studies grouped 
according to the treatment assigned at randomization. 
The safety analysis set consisted of all patients who received at least one dose of study drug, 
with patients grouped according to treatment received 
Hypothesis testing for all efficacy endpoints were conducted in the full-analysis set (FAS).  
The study level type-1 error for the family of primary and select secondary efficacy hypotheses are 
controlled at α = 0.05. The co-primary hypotheses (H1 and H2) are tested simultaneously at first. If 
both of the co-primary hypotheses are rejected at a two-sided significance level of 0.05, then the 
secondary hypotheses are tested in a sequential order. Studies GA39688 and GA39855 are identical in 
design. The requirement of rescue treatment (systemic CS or nasal polypectomy) was tested using the 
PFAS from Studies GA39688 and GA39855 studies if the analysis findings from the two studies are 
consistent. The corresponding hypotheses are denoted as H8. 
All hypothesis tests are two-sided. Unless otherwise noted, all analyses of efficacy outcome measures 
are adjusted by geographic region through the use of a categorical variable and by baseline asthma 
comorbidity and aspirin sensitivity status.  
Treatment group comparisons of absolute change from baseline at Week 24 in average daily NCS 
between treatment groups was assessed using a mixed-effect model repeated measurement (MMRM) 
model with unstructured covariance. The variance-covariance matrices for each treatment group were 
assumed equal. The Kenward-Rogers approximation (Kenward and Roger 1997) was used to calculate 
the denominator degrees of freedom. The dependent variable is absolute change from baseline in 
average daily NCS. In addition to adjustment for geographic region and asthma/aspirin sensitivity 
comorbidity status, the model includes terms for treatment group, timepoint (Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 
and 24), baseline value of the dependent variable (baseline average daily NCS in this case), treatment 
by timepoint interaction, and baseline value of dependent variable by timepoint interaction. Point 
estimates, 95% confidence intervals, and p-values for the treatment effect (omalizumab vs. placebo) 
on absolute change from baseline at a timepoint in average daily NCS were calculated on the basis of 
the model for all post-baseline analysis timepoints. 
NPS is the sum of the polyp scores in both nostrils (maximum score of 8) as assessed by independent 
expert reviewers. The absolute change from baseline at Week 24 in NPS for each patient is defined as 
the NPS assessment assigned to Week 24 minus the NPS at baseline. The estimand and primary 
estimator method for NPS followed those used for NCS. 
Patients with baseline and no post-baseline data were included in the model for the calculation of the 
LS means. The LS-means will be calculated using the coefficients of the independent variables 
weighted according to that observed in the FAS, regardless of treatment assignment. This marginal 
weighting of coefficients for LS-means may impact the estimates of the means in each treatment arm 
but would not impact the difference between means in arms because the same covariate values are 
applied to calculate the means in both arms. The null hypothesis will be tested by the t-test arriving 
from the treatment group difference in LS-means of the change from baseline at Week 24 in average 
daily NCS.

Intercurrent events defined are (1) Had rescue treatment not been made available prior to Week 24; 
(2) regardless of study drug discontinuation due to AE/PD/LOE. All values after the intercurrent event 
would be coded to worst observed event value carried forward (worst observed value post-
randomization and up to and including the day of the intercurrent event for that patient). 
Missing data not explicitly covered above will be assumed MAR (i.e., given the observed outcomes and 
other variables in the statistical model missingness is independent of the unobserved outcomes). This 
type of missing data will not be explicitly imputed.

Results 
Participant flow 
In study GA39688, a total of 355 patients were screened and 217 failed screening. The most common 
reason of screen failure reported was the failure to meet the NPS inclusion criteria of  “NPS ≥5, with a 
unilateral score of ≥2 for each nostril, at screening (Day -35), and on Day -7 (as assessed by a central 
panel of independent central readers)” (49.8%). The second most common reason (31.8%) was 
eligibility per the study drug-dosing table (serum IgE level ≥30 to ≤1500 IU/mL and body weight ≥30 
to ≤150 kg) and ability to be dosed per the dosing table. Other reasons of screen failures were each 
reported in <5% of patients. 
In study GA39855, a total of 329 patients were screened and 202 failed screening. The most common 
reason of screen failure reported was the failure to meet the NPS inclusion criteria of “NPS ≥5, with a 
unilateral score of ≥2 for each nostril, at screening (Day -35), and on Day -7 (as assessed by a central 
panel of independent central readers)” (49.0%). The second most common reason (23.3%) was 
eligibility per the study drug-dosing table (serum IgE level ≥30 to ≤1500 IU/mL and body weight ≥30 
to ≤150 kg) and ability to be dosed per the dosing table. Other reasons of screen failures were each 
reported in <10% of patients. 
Patient disposition was similar between studies GA39688 and GA39855. Overall, 265 patients were 
randomized (138 in study GA39688, 127 in study GA39855), 131 to placebo (66 in study GA39688, 65 
in study GA39855) and 134 to omalizumab (72 in study GA39688, 62 in study GA39855). A total of 11 
patients (4.2%) discontinued the studies (including the 4 week follow-up), 4 (3.1%) in the placebo 
arms and 7 (5.2%) in the omalizumab arm, predominantly as per the patient’s wish (10 patients; all 4 
in the placebo arm and 6 in the omalizumab arm). The 1 remaining patient was withdrawn from the 
study by the physician.

Reasons for withdrawal from the study in the placebo groups were lack of time, no interest in 
completing follow-up, disturbing nasal symptoms and one subject resigned without given reason. In 
the omalizumab groups the reasons were pregnancy, incarceration, lack of time, resignation without 
given reason and emigration.

Recruitment 
In the GA39688 study, the patients were enrolled at 37 investigational sites across 10 countries. A 
total of 96 patients were enrolled in Europe (69.5%), 33 patients in the US (23.9%), 7 patients in 
Canada (5.1%), and 2 patients were enrolled in Mexico (1.4%). A listing of investigators and 
randomization details has been provided. 
First patient was enrolled on the 15 November 2017 and the last visit of the last patient was on the 11 
March 2019.  
In the GA39855 study, the patients were enrolled at 45 investigational sites across 10 countries. A 
total of 101 patients were enrolled in Europe (79.5%), 23 patients in the US (18.1%), and 3 patients 
were enrolled in Mexico (2.4%). A listing of investigators and randomization details has been provided.

The first patient was enrolled on the 21 November 2017 and the last visit of the last patient was on the 
7 March 2019. 
Conduct of the study 
The studies were conducted in accordance with the principles of the “Declaration of Helsinki” and Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP) according to the regulations and procedures described in the following sections 
of the protocol. 
Approval from the Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC) was obtained 
before study start and was documented in a letter to the investigator specifying the date on which the 
committee met and granted the approval. The Sponsor also obtained approval from the relevant 
Competent Authority prior to starting the study. 
No modifications were made to the protocol after receipt of the IRB/IEC approval. Protocol 
amendments were prepared by the Sponsor and were submitted to the IRB/IEC and to Regulatory 
Authorities in accordance with local regulatory requirements. Approval was obtained from the IRB/IEC 
and regulatory authorities (as locally required) before implementation of any changes. The study 
protocol for GA39688 and GA39855 version2 was signed on 11-Oct-2017.  
The first SAP version was signed 24-Jan-2019 and the final SAP was signed 15-Apr-2019. Data of data 
base lock and unblinding was 2019-Apr-17 for both studies.   
In both studies GA39688 and GA39855, all of the reported major protocol deviations were related to 
inclusion/exclusion criteria or procedural deviations, and not considered to have an impact on the 
interpretation of efficacy results of those studies, as demonstrated by sensitivity analyses. In the PFAS, 
15 patients (11.5%) in the placebo arm and 16 patients (11.9%) in the omalizumab arm had at least 
one major protocol deviation.

Baseline data 
Demographics at baseline were generally similar between Studies GA39688 and GA39855, and 
between treatment arms within each study (Table 6). Baseline disease characteristics are shown in 
Table 7.

IgE-levels and dosing 
The doses given in the phase-3-studies are shown in Table 8. 
EMA/404869/2020  
Page 37/78 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Table 8. Study drug exposures, pooled analysis set 
Mean IgE at baseline was 168 IU/mL, median 121 IU/mL, and the lower tertial had an IgE-
concentration of 70 IU/mL or lower, i.e. below the threshold of 76 IU/mL where patients with allergic 
asthma were less likely to experience benefit from the treatment. As opposed to allergic asthma, in 
CSU the mechanism of action is unclear, and dosing cannot be based on IgE-levels. The CHMP 
concluded that 300 mg every 4 weeks was needed to significantly improve symptoms.

Numbers analysed 
Study GA39688 
138 patients were randomized to the study: 66 and 72 patients each were randomized to receive 
placebo and omalizumab respectively, comprising the full analysis set. 
Study GA39855 
127 patients were randomized to the study: 65 and 62 patients each were randomized to receive placebo 
and omalizumab respectively, comprising the full analysis set. 
Overall, 265 patients were randomized (138 in Study GA39688, 127 in Study GA39855), 131 to 
placebo (66 in Study GA39688, 65 in Study GA39855) and 134 to omalizumab (72 in Study GA39688, 
62 in Study GA39855). 
Outcomes and estimation 
Co-primary endpoints 
In both pivotal Phase-III studies GA39688 and GA39855, the co-primary endpoints of the changes 
from baseline at Week 24 in NPS and the average daily NCS were met. For each of the co-primary 
endpoints, the between-treatment difference in the adjusted mean changes at Week 24 was 
statistically significant in favour of omalizumab. 
Nasal polyp score (NPS) 
Nasal polyp score ranges from 0 (best) to 8 (worst).  The results for the separate studies as well as the 
pooled analysis are shown in Table 9. 
Table 9. Absolute Change from Baseline at Week 24 in the Nasal Polyp Score (Co-Primary Endpoint) for 
Studies GA39688 and GA39855 (Full Analysis Sets), and Overall (Pooled Full Analysis Set) 
When evaluated over time, in both study GA39688 and study GA39855, the difference between the 
two treatment arms was observed at the first assessment at Week 4, with adjusted mean differences 
of -0.92 (95% CI: -1.37, -0.48) in study GA39688 and -0.52 (95% CI: -0.94, -0.11) in study

GA39855. However, statistical tests at this timepoint were not included in the type 1 error control 
plan. 
An exploratory analysis compared the number of patients with an improvement (i.e. a reduction) from 
baseline to Week 24 in NPS of ≥1.0 and ≥2.0 between treatment arms based on the PFAS. An 
improvement of ≥1.0 was achieved by 37/129 patients (28.7%) in the placebo arm and 72/128 
patients (56.3%) in the omalizumab arm (OR: 3.38; 95% CI: 1.99, 5.76; p<0.0001). Corresponding 
frequencies for an improvement of ≥2.0 were 15/129 patients (11.6%) and 40/128 patients (31.3%), 
respectively (OR: 3.43; 95% CI: 1.77, 6.68; p=0.0003). 
The results in individual studies were similar. In study GA39688, the corresponding between-
treatment ORs were 4.07 (95% CI: 1.91, 8.66; p=0.0003) for an improvement of ≥1.0 and 5.44 (95% 
CI: 1.91, 15.03; p=0.0011) for an improvement of ≥2.0. In study GA39855, these ORs were 2.84 
(95% CI: 1.32, 6.14; p=0.0077) and 2.39 (95% CI: 0.95, 6.05; p=0.0649), respectively. 
Average daily nasal congestion score (NCS) 
NCS ranges from 0 (best) to 3 (worst). The results for the separate studies as well as the pooled 
analysis are shown in Table 10. 
Table 10. Absolute Change from Baseline at Week 24 in Average Daily Nasal Congestion Score (Co-
Primary Endpoint): Studies GA39688 and GA39855 (Full Analysis Sets), and Overall (Pooled Full 
Analysis Set) 
When evaluated over time, in both study GA39688 and study GA39855, the difference between the 
two treatment arms was observed at the first assessment at Week 4, with adjusted mean differences 
of -0.25 (95% CI: -0.46, -0.04) in study GA39688 and -0.26 (95% CI: -0.45, -0.07) in study 
GA39855. However, statistical tests at this timepoint were not included in the type 1 error control 
plan. 
An exploratory analysis compared the number of patients with an improvement (i.e. a reduction) from 
baseline to Week 24 in average daily NCS of ≥0.5 and ≥1.0 between treatment arms in patients of the 
PFAS eligible for respective improvement. An improvement of ≥0.5 was achieved by 38/129 patients 
(29.5%) in the placebo arm and 75/126 patients (59.5%) in the omalizumab arm (OR: 3.77; 95% CI: 
2.20, 6.46; p<0.0001). Corresponding frequencies for an improvement of ≥1.0 were 27/126 patients 
(21.4%) and 56/126 patients (44.4%), respectively (OR: 3.17; 95% CI: 1.79, 5.61; p<0.0001). 
EMA/404869/2020  
Page 40/78 
 
  
 
 
 
In study GA39688, the corresponding between-treatment ORs were 3.00 (95% CI: 1.44, 6.23; 
p=0.0033) for an improvement of ≥0.5 and 2.55 (95% CI: 1.19, 5.44; p=0.0158) for an improvement 
of ≥1.0. In study GA39855, these ORs were 5.66 (95% CI: 2.44, 13.16; p<0.0001) and 4.46 (95% 
CI: 1.83, 10.84; p=0.0010), respectively. 
Secondary endpoints 
There were two separate and distinct sets of secondary endpoints with different type 1 error control 
testing hierarchy. This was done to accommodate different prioritizations of secondary endpoints for 
the EU and the US applications. Overview of secondary efficacy endpoints for the EU application are 
shown in Table 11. For totality of data, a summary of the US endpoints (Study GA39688 and 
GA39855 separately) are shown in Table 12 and Table 13.

Change from Baseline at Week 24 in Average Daily Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) 
In both studies GA39688 and GA39855, the difference between omalizumab and placebo in the 
change from baseline at Week 24 in the average daily TNSS (scale: 0 [best] to 12 [worst]) showed a 
benefit for the omalizumab arm (Table 14).

Change from Baseline at Week 24 in Total Sinonasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22) 
In both studies GA39688 and GA39855, omalizumab was shown to be superior over placebo in the 
change from baseline at Week 24 in the total SNOT-22 (scale: 0 [best] to 110 [worst]), see Table 15

In both studies GA39688 and GA39855, all patients having experienced an intercurrent event were 
imputed as not having realized an improvement at Week 24 in SNOT-22 of at least the MID. 
The proportion of patients who experienced an improvement from baseline at Week 24 of at least the 
MID (8.9 points) in SNOT-22 score was 30/65 (46.2%) in the placebo arm and 53/69 (76.8%) in the 
omalizumab arm in study GA39688 and 23/63 (36.5%) in the placebo arm and 39/59 (66.1%) in the 
omalizumab arm in study GA39855, resulting in an OR of 4.55 (95% CI 2.07, 9.97; p=0.0002) in 
study GA39688 and 3.71 (95% CI: 1.72, 8.04; p=0.0009) in study GA39855 in favour of 
omalizumab. 
Change from Baseline at Week 24 in the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) 
In both studies GA39688 and GA39855, the difference between omalizumab and placebo in the 
change from baseline at Week 24 in the UPSIT (scale: 0 [worst] to 40 [best]) showed a benefit for the 
omalizumab arm (Table 16).

Requirement of Rescue Treatment through Week 24 
In both studies GA39688 and GA39855, the number of patients requiring rescue treatment anytime 
from randomization through Week 24 was small (Table 19). Treatment differences were not 
statistically significant in either study or in the pooled analysis. Among the patients considered as 
requiring rescue treatment were 2 patients in the placebo arm, 1 in each study, and none in the 
omalizumab arms, who had an intercurrent event of early discontinuation of study drug due to an 
adverse event or lack of efficacy. As per the SAP, these 2 patients were imputed as having required 
rescue treatment for each of the endpoints shown in table, although they did not actually receive 
respective rescue treatment. 
In study GA39688, the proportion of patients with rescue treatment (systemic corticosteroids for ≥ 3 
consecutive days or nasal polypectomy) was 4.6% (3/65 patients) in the placebo arm and 2.9% (2/70 
patients) in the omalizumab arm (treatment comparison: unadjusted odds ratio [OR]: 0.61; 95% CI: 
0.05, 5.51; nominal p=0.6716. Corresponding frequencies in study GA39855 were 7.8% (5/64 
patients) and 1.7% (1/59 patients), respectively (OR: 0.20; 95% CI: 0.02, 1.89; p=0.1594). 
In the pooled analysis, which comprised the pre-specified secondary endpoint analysis in each of the 
studies, the proportion of patients who required rescue treatment was 6.2% (8/129 patients) in the 
placebo arm and 2.3% (3/129 patients) in the omalizumab arm (table). As in the individual studies, 
the resulting treatment arm difference was not statistically significant (OR: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.10, 1.49; 
nominal p=0.1639). 
All patients who required rescue treatment through Week 24, required medication with systemic 
corticosteroids for ≥ 3 consecutive days. Hence, the results for the endpoint of the number of patients 
who required systemic corticosteroids for ≥ 3 consecutive days were identical to those described above 
for the combined rescue treatment endpoint. 
No patients had nasal polypectomy during the study. However, the 2 aforementioned patients of the 
pooled placebo arm were imputed as having had nasal polypectomy as per the SAP. Treatment arm 
differences were not statistically significant, neither in the individual studies nor in the pooled analysis 
which comprised the pre-specified secondary endpoint analysis in each of the studies.

Ancillary analyses 
Sub-group analyses 
Subgroup analyses were performed for the co-primary efficacy endpoints 
•  Change from baseline at Week 24 in NPS 
•  Change from baseline at Week 24 in average daily NCS 
This was based on pooled data from studies GA39688 and GA39855. Separate analysis models were 
fitted for each subgroup. The statistical methods for each model were the same as specified for the 
individual studies, with the exception that an adjustment factor for study was added to the models as 
an additional covariate. There were no issues with model convergence due to small sample size. 
Estimates of 95% CIs of between-treatment arm differences in adjusted means within subgroups were 
not adjusted for multiplicity. 
Subgroups defined by demographic factors were: 
EMA/404869/2020  
Page 49/78 
 
  
 
 
 
•  Age: < 65 years, ≥ 65 years 
•  Sex: male, female 
• 
IxRS geographic location: North America, ex-North America 
Subgroups defined by baseline disease factors were: 
•  Asthma aspirin comorbidity: asthmatic and aspirin sensitive, asthmatic not aspirin sensitive, no 
asthma 
• 
Prior sinonasal surgery: No, Yes 
•  Baseline antileukotriene treatment: No, Yes 
• 
Eosinophil count: ≤ 300, > 300 
NPS and NCS 
There were no significant differences in the treatment effect between any prespecified subgroup and its 
complementary group, as indicated by overlapping 95% CIs for respective estimated between-
treatment difference within subgroups (Figure 8 and Figure 9).

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The MAH submitted a variation application for the following indication:  
Xolair is indicated for the treatment of nasal polyps in adult patients (18 years and above) with 
inadequate response to intranasal corticosteroids. 
The MAH received Scientific Advice (SA) from the CHMP on 21 April 2017 (EMEA/H/SA/45/4/2017/III); 
the advice given then has mostly been adhered to but there are deviations with regard to the dose as 
discussed below. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
In support of this new indication application, the MAH conducted two identical pivotal phase-III, 
randomized, multi-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies to assess the efficacy and 
safety of omalizumab in patients with nasal polyps (studies GA39688 and GA39855). The design of 
the studies was mostly in line with the SA given in 2017. The studies length was 24 weeks, with a 5-
week run-in period and a 4-week safety follow-up period, and not 52 weeks as recommended in the SA 
for the durability of the response and the potentially delayed maximum efficacy to be explored over a 
longer timeframe. Nevertheless, the MAH has conducted the Polyp studies for 24 weeks and has 
initiated an open-label extension study, WA40169 (the OLE study) with safety as primary objective.

The patient population was recruited across sites in North America (25%) and Europe (70%). There 
were no differences in baseline NPS or NCS, nor end-of-study, between the regions. The MAH has 
included sites able to carry out the study with maintained patient safety. There was no apparent 
impact on the final results. 
In total, 265 patients were randomised, and 254 patients completed the studies, 127 in each of the 
treatment arms (pooled data). Upon request by CHMP, the reasons for discontinuation (4 in the 
placebo arms and 7 in the omalizumab arms) were provided by the MAH. Those were acknowledged by 
CHMP. Study GA39688 over-enrolled by more than 10%, however this is not considered to have any 
impact on the conclusions reached. The number of patients is considered to be adequate for the 
hypothesis. 
Nasal steroids were to be taken throughout the studies. For moderately or severely symptomatic nasal 
polyps, clinical experience suggests that intranasal delivery of glucocorticoids may be improved by the 
use of topical drops (instead of spray). Upon request by CHMP, the MAH clarified that as mometasone 
intranasal spray was deemed broadly available, it was chosen as standard of treatment to which 
omalizumab or placebo was added. Further, protocol exclusion criteria included the use of intranasal 
corticosteroid spray (INCS) drops. There was one screen failure and one protocol eligibility deviation 
involving the use of corticosteroid topical drops. The CHMP considered that further analysis is thus not 
feasible.  
The choice of the dosing regimen was not fully discussed in the initial application and no dose-finding 
study as recommended in the SA given in 2017 was submitted by the MAH. Although exposure-
response analyses were conducted in the phase III studies, the uncertainties with regards to the 
appropriate posology for the newly proposed indication remained. Therefore, the MAH was requested 
by CHMP to provide further support that the mechanism of action of omalizumab is similar to the one 
of allergic asthma and to provide further data supporting the choice of the dosing regimen as proposed 
in section 4.2 of the SmPC. Based on the scientific publications provided by the MAH, the CHMP 
considered that the clinical association between allergic asthma and chronic rhinitis with or without 
nasal polyps is well-established and that many of the patients share a common inflammatory response. 
With regard to the dose issue, the MAH has performed subgroup analyses with comparison of the 
effect of the doses 150 q4wk, 300 mg q4wk and higher doses, for NPS, NCS, TNSS and SNOT-22. 
Patients with baseline IgE <76 IU/ml and ≥76 IU/ml were also analysed in subgroups. There were no 
general differences between the dose subgroups with omalizumab showing better results than placebo 
in all groups. Omalizumab showed numerically better results in all subgroup analyses, with remaining 
statistical significance in most analyses. Based on the current knowledge about the pathophysiology of 
nasal CRSwNP and its similarity to allergic asthma, as opposed to CSU (where the pathophysiology has 
not been established), CHMP agreed that the same dosing regimen can be chosen for both allergic 
asthma and CRSwNP. The description of mechanism of action in the new indication in section 5.1 as 
well as the dosing regimen proposed in section 4.2 of the SmPC were endorsed by CHMP.  
To ensure inclusion of patients with prominent polyposis, NPS ≥5 and NCS ≥2 were two of the 
inclusion criteria. The NCS score were discussed in the SA given in 2017 and the MAH has followed the 
recommendation to include patients with NCS ≥2, which would ensure inclusion of a more severely 
affected population. Furthermore, patients must have a SNOT-22 score ≥ 20 at screening (Day -35) 
and at randomization (Day 1); inclusion of persons with a score as low as 20 might provide a risk to 
include patients with only moderate disease. However, in conjunction with the other inclusion criteria, 
this level is considered acceptable. Since omalizumab would be a top-on treatment in patients not 
adequately controlled on nasal steroids, the patients continued their nasal steroid treatment during the 
study which was considered acceptable by CHMP. The exclusion criteria were considered to be 
generally relevant. 
EMA/404869/2020  
Page 58/78 
 
  
 
 
There were 2 co-primary endpoints i.e. change in nasal polyp score (NPS) and change in 7-day 
average of daily nasal congestion score (NCS) at week 24. This approach is in line with the SA received 
in 2017 and is considered to be acceptable by CHMP as change in nasal polyp size on its own is not 
considered sufficient but adding an endpoint evaluating the impact of symptoms is of importance in 
measuring outcomes in nasal polyposis. Furthermore, severity of disease is primarily based on 
symptoms rather than polyp size. There are no established limits for clinically relevant effect for these 
endpoints, but the applicant used a 0.56 point difference for NCS and 1.50 for NPS as basis for their 
samples size calculations.  
Secondary endpoints comprised change in TNSS, SNOT-22 and UPSIT at week 24, and change from 
baseline at week 16 in NPS and NCS. SNOT-22 is a quality of life-related score that has been validated 
to have minimal clinical important difference (MCID) of 8.9 points. The other scores, including NPS and 
NCS, do not have any established MCIDs but upon request by CHMP, the MAH has discussed what 
changes in the observed scores would be clinically relevant. The last secondary endpoint was 
requirement of rescue treatment [systemic corticosteroids for ≥3 consecutive days or nasal 
polypectomy].  
Randomisation was stratified by comorbid asthma, aspirin sensitivity and geographic region (North 
America and others).  
In the SA from 2017, the MAH was recommended to stratify for prior sinonasal surgery (in addition to 
comorbid asthma, aspirin sensitivity and geographic region) but this was not done which could be 
acceptable considering difficulties with too many strata. It is noted that both studies are balanced and 
when pooling the data from the two studies, approximately 60% of the included patients in the 
different treatment arms had sinonasal surgery.  
Further, as only two patients could be classified as having asthma according to GINA step 5, a 
subgroup efficacy analysis of this group is not warranted, which is also applicable to the group of 
patients with uncontrolled asthma. It can be concluded that the results obtained in the studies were 
not, more than possibly marginally, biased by the effect of Xolair in severely asthmatic patients. 
There are two distinct and equally important estimands of interest defined in this trial. The first 
estimand is the treatment group difference in mean change from baseline at Week 24 in NPS in 
patients with CRSwNP, where the need for rescue medication, nasal polypectomy or study drug 
discontinuation is accounted for as an unfavourable (worst) outcome. The second estimand is the 
treatment group difference in mean change from baseline at Week 24 in the average daily NCS in 
patients with CRSwNP, where the need for rescue medication, nasal polypectomy or study drug 
discontinuation is accounted for as an unfavourable (worst) outcome. The analysis population is the 
FAS.  
The chosen statistical method is a MMRM together with failure imputation for patients with intercurrent 
events. It is not apparent that the handling of intercurrent events and missing data provides a 
conservative estimate of the treatment effect. The number of intercurrent events by type and 
treatment group together with the observed and imputed data were presented by the MAH. The 
numbers are low and the impact on the estimate of treatment effect was considered to be minor.  
The type 1 error is controlled at 5% for the co-primary endpoints and the 6 secondary endpoints. All 
other p-values presented are unadjusted and should be interpreted as descriptive.  
The statistical method is considered to be acceptable for the two pivotal studies.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In both pivotal Phase-III studies GA39688 and GA39855, the co-primary endpoints of the changes 
from baseline at Week 24 in NPS and the average daily NCS were met. For each of the co-primary 
endpoints, the between-treatment difference in the adjusted mean changes at Week 24 was 
statistically significant in favour of omalizumab (p-value of <0.05 in both studies for both co-primary 
endpoints).  
At baseline, the participants had a mean NPS (the range of the score is 0/best-8/worst) of 6.21 in the 
placebo group and 6.31 in the omalizumab treatment arm (pooled data). Both groups improved with 
0.13 (placebo) resp. 0.99 (omalizumab), nominal p<0.0001 for pooled data. For NCS, the inclusion 
criterion was ≥2 and the treatment groups had 2.38 (placebo) resp. 2.34 (omalizumab) at baseline 
(the range of the score is 0/best-3/worst). Both groups improved with 0.28 (placebo) resp. 0.80 
(omalizumab), nominal p<0.0001 for the pooled data. Thus, the primary objectives to show superiority 
of omalizumab to placebo were formally met.  
The sample size calculations were based on a 0.56 point difference for NCS and 1.50 for NPS. These 
differences were not achieved. However, omalizumab was statistically significantly better than placebo 
in both pivotal studies and both co-primary endpoints. As there are no formal MCIDs established for 
the co-primary endpoints (NPS and NCS), the MAH was requested to discuss the clinical relevance of 
these outcomes. The MAH presented literature data from relevant published studies, describing the use 
of INCS (placebo as comparator in the majority of studies) or biologics (placebo as comparator) where 
these endpoints were applied. Although results should be interpreted with caution as there are 
differences in study designs and included populations, the effect as recorded by NPS and NCS appears 
to be of similar magnitude as in publications describing patients responding to intranasal 
corticosteroids (INCS) which is deemed clinically relevant. Comparison to other biologics is more 
difficult due to the smaller number of studies and heterogeneity of publications. Furthermore, biologics 
acts through different pathways in the inflammatory cascade. Omalizumab affects primarily only IgE-
binding on mast cells and basophils whereas mepolizumab and reslizumab affects IL-5 with a following 
decrease in eosinophils. Dupilumab affects IL-4 and IL-13, which leads to an impact on both 
eosinophils and IgE. The effect level as compared with other biologicals remain uncertain as there are 
no directly comparing studies. The point estimates of effect appeared higher in dupilumab studies, but 
these studies had different enrolment criteria with respect to requirement for prior surgeries and 
systemic steroids, differences in populations enrolled, and other differences in study conduct.    
For the secondary endpoints TNSS, SNOT-22 and UPSIT, omalizumab showed improvement compared 
to placebo (all three endpoints had a p-value of <0.05 in both studies and the nominal p-value for the 
pooled data was p<0.0001). Approximately 40% of the patients in the placebo arms and 70% of the 
patients in the omalizumab arms had a change of at least 8.9 points in SNOT-22. The adjusted mean 
(SE) for the change in SNOT-22 at week 24 compared to baseline was -7.73(1.51) in the pooled 
placebo arm, i.e. below the threshold for clinical relevance, but -23.10(1.50) in the pooled omalizumab 
group. NPS and NCS change at 16 weeks were included to show consistent efficacy, which was 
demonstrated (both endpoints had a p-value of <0.05 in both studies and the nominal p for the pooled 
data was p<0.0001).  
Requirement of rescue treatment was compared between the treatment arms, with 8/129 (6.2%) in 
the placebo group and 3/129 (2.3%) in the omalizumab group. All required systemic corticosteroids of 
≥3 consecutive days while two patients in the placebo arm (one in each study) required surgery. The 
number of events was greater in the placebo group, but the overall numbers were too small to power 
any relevant comparison and thus, no firm conclusion could be drawn. In the SA, the CHMP asked for 
this endpoint, but a study length of 24 weeks is too short to yield any assessable data.  
EMA/404869/2020  
Page 60/78 
 
  
 
 
Subgroup analyses showed no relevant differences in the co-primary endpoints. 
When entering the OLE-study WA40169 after 24 weeks in the parent studies, the patients received 
omalizumab for 28 weeks, followed by 24 weeks without omalizumab. Upon request by CHMP, a 
preliminary data cut was performed on 24 February 2020 when 213 patients had completed the follow-
up period to evaluate long-term efficacy and durability of the response. Analysis of the co-primary 
endpoints as well as secondary endpoints (TNSS, SNOT-22 and UPSIT) showed greater improvement in 
those receiving omalizumab in both the parent study and the OLE-study, compared to those receiving 
omalizumab in the OLE-study following placebo treatment in the parent studies, although the results 
for the latter group approached those of the former group when omalizumab was introduced. 
Improvement was sustained during omalizumab treatment. After 28 weeks of open-label treatment, 
omalizumab was withdrawn. After the follow-up period of 24 weeks, all endpoints had started to 
deteriorate, however, were still improved compared to baseline in the parent studies for both 
treatment arms.  
As allergic rhinitis can be of a more seasonal character, and thus a 24-week study might miss 
symptoms that only occur in a certain season, the MAH was requested to report occurrence of allergic 
rhinitis and how it was handled during the study. The CHMP considered that since there were a small 
number of reported rhinitis, and that all patients received nasal corticosteroids, it is unlikely that there 
would be a significant larger number of reports of symptoms of allergic rhinitis if the studies were 
performed during a whole year. Thus, it is considered that allergic rhinitis co-morbidity did not impact 
the efficacy analyses. 
The initially proposed indication (Xolair is indicated for the treatment of nasal polyps in adult patients 
(18 years and above) with inadequate response to intranasal corticosteroids) was considered to be too 
broad and not sufficiently covered by the data provided. The studied population was considered to 
represent patients with severe disease based on baseline severity scores. The indication granted by 
CHMP istherefore as an add-on therapy with intranasal corticosteroids (INC) for the treatment of adults 
(18 years and above) with severe Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) for whom 
therapy with INC does not provide adequate disease control. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy results from the two pivotal studies GA39688 and GA39855 demonstrated that the 
omalizumab dose regimen based on IgE-level and weight, provided statistically significant and clinically 
relevant improvements in NPS and NCS at week 24 compared to placebo, in adult patients with severe 
CRSwNP with inadequate response to intranasal corticosteroid treatment. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Xolair is currently approved for the treatment of allergic asthma in children (≥ 6 years), adolescents 
and adults, and for the treatment of CSU in adolescents (≥ 12 years) and adults, in the EU and USA, 
and in numerous other countries worldwide. The overall safety profile of omalizumab has been well-
characterized. The estimated cumulative omalizumab exposure is >16,000 patients in clinical trials and 
>1 million patient years in the post-marketing setting, as of 31 December 2018.  
The safety database for the new indication treatment of nasal polyps in patients who have inadequate 
response to intranasal corticosteroids consists of data from the two pivotal clinical studies GA39688 
EMA/404869/2020  
Page 61/78 
 
  
 
 
and GA39855. Supportive data from an interim analysis of the ongoing, OLE study (WA40169) are also 
included. This latter study is ongoing, and the data presented are retrieved from an interim analysis 
(clinical data cut-off date of 11 March 2019).   
Patient exposure 
During the two pivotal studies, a total of 265 patients were exposed to omalizumab or placebo. Of 
these, 249 continued into the OLE study. 
•  135 patients received omalizumab during the two Phase III studies GA39688 and GA39855, 
corresponding to a total of 51.5 patient-years. Of these, 124 patients continued into the OLE 
study WA40169. 
•  130 patients received placebo only during the two Phase III Studies GA39688 and GA39855. 
Of these, 125 patients continued into the OLE study WA40169. 
•  Across all three studies, 260 patients received at least one dose of omalizumab during either 
the parent studies or the OLE study. 
At the time of the interim analysis, the median duration of OLE treatment with omalizumab was 8.1 
weeks (range 0.1 to 26.7 weeks). Including exposure to omalizumab in the parent studies, patients 
who received omalizumab in the parent study were exposed to omalizumab for median 28.6 weeks 
(12.6 to 45.4 weeks), while patients who received placebo in the parent study were exposed to 
omalizumab for 8.1 weeks (range 0.1 to 26.7 weeks) during the OLE extension study. This corresponds 
to a total exposure to omalizumab of 43.0 patient years from patients treated during the OLE study, 
plus a total exposure of 51.5 patient years from patients who received omalizumab in the parent 
study. 
For details on the demographics and baseline disease characteristics of the included patients, please 
see Table 6 and Table 7 in the efficacy part. 
In all 3 studies, omalizumab was administered using the proposed dose regimen, i.e., SC injections 
every 2 or 4 weeks. This dose level is similar to that already approved for allergic asthma. The safety 
analysis population was defined as all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study 
drug. 
In both treatment arms, the majority of patients received the planned dosing regimen of study drug 
once every 4 weeks (omalizumab 90.4%, placebo 86.9%) (Table 23). The median treatment duration 
was 20 weeks in both arms, and the median overall duration of post-randomization follow-up was 26 
weeks in both studies. The total exposure in patient years was 51.5 and 49.9 for the omalizumab and 
placebo arms, respectively. The majority of patients reported they were adherent to the intranasal 
mometasone regimen throughout the 24-week blinded treatment period (placebo 89.2%, omalizumab 
89.6% of patients).

Adverse events  
Adverse events (AEs) were reported during the studies until the end of the safety follow-up (4-week 
follow-up in pivotal studies GA39688 and GA39855; up to data cut-off in the ongoing OLE study 
WA40169).  
For pivotal studies GA39688 and GA39855, treatment emergent AEs were defined as any AE or any 
worsening of a pre-existing condition with an onset after the first dose of study drug.  
For the ongoing OLE Study WA40169, treatment emergent AEs are defined as any new AE with an 
onset during the OLE study (i.e., after the first dose of open-label treatment with omalizumab), or any 
worsening of a pre-existing condition during the OLE study (i.e., ongoing AE from parent study which 
increased in severity during open-label treatment with omalizumab) and prior to 29 days after the last 
dose of omalizumab. Non-treatment emergent AEs for OLE Study WA40169 are defined as those AEs 
occurring during the parent study and continuing into the OLE study without worsening.  
An overall summary of the adverse events recorded is presented in table 25. 
Common adverse events - pivotal trials 
The majority of adverse events (AEs) were of mild or moderate intensity (patients with severe AEs: 
placebo 6 of 76 (7.9%); omalizumab 5 out of 68 (7.4%). The most frequently reported AEs overall 
(incidence ≥ 3% of patients in either treatment arm) included headache, nasopharyngitis, asthma, 
EMA/404869/2020  
Page 63/78 
 
  
 
 
 
injection site reaction, upper abdominal pain, arthralgia, back pain, dizziness, epistaxis, rhinitis, 
sinusitis, nasal polyps, and nasal congestion. Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) reported in ≥3% of 
patients and reported at a numerically higher incidence with omalizumab than with placebo (PT level) 
included headache, injection site reaction, arthralgia, dizziness, sinusitis and upper abdominal pain 
(Table 26 and Table 27). All of these AEs have been known to be associated with omalizumab and 
(except for sinusitis) are listed as adverse reactions in the Xolair product information. AEs of sinusitis 
were medically judged as likely to be associated with the disease under study rather than with study 
drug.

Common adverse events – OLE study (interim report) 
Overall, 63 patients (25.3%) experienced at least one TEAE with onset during open-label omalizumab 
treatment. As of the clinical cut-off date, the overall proportions of patients reporting TEAE switch 
onset during open-label omalizumab treatment was similar between patients who had received either 
placebo (31 patients [24.8%]) or omalizumab (32 patients [25.8%]) in the parent study. The most 
commonly reported system organ class SOCs) with onset during open-label omalizumab treatment 
(>5% incidence of overall events) were infections and infestations (25 patients [10.0%]; of these were 
7 cases nasopharyngitis and 6 cases upper respiratory tract infection) and respiratory, thoracic and 
mediastinal disorders (14 patients [5.6%]). 
EMA/404869/2020  
Page 65/78 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Two additional events with onset during open-label omalizumab treatment were considered of interest 
even though they were reported in less than 2% of patients: pruritus and hypertension. The 4 patients 
with pruritus all experienced events of moderate severity and all received treatment; at the time of the 
clinical cut-off 2 events were resolved, 1 event was resolving, and 1 event was unresolved. The 
unresolved event led to discontinuation of omalizumab treatment. 
Seven patients (2.8%) experienced at least one TEAE with onset during open-label omalizumab 
treatment suspected to be related to omalizumab or mometasone by the investigator. The 13 TEAEs 
considered related to omalizumab by the investigator included the following preferred terms: injection 
site pain (1 patient), injection site bruising (2 patients), injection site inflammation (1 patient), 
injection site reaction (1 patient), nervousness (1 patient), and pruritus (1 patient). All 13 TEAEs with 
onset during open-label omalizumab treatment were of mild or moderate severity and, with exception 
of pruritus and nervousness, had occurred within 2 days of omalizumab injection. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Omalizumab was not associated with an increased risk (versus placebo) of any serious adverse events 
(SAEs). There were no deaths in either treatment arm during the course of the studies (pooled analysis 
(studies GA39688 and GA39855) and ongoing OLE study WA40169 (data cut-off date of 11 Mar 2019). 
SAEs included the following PTs: pneumonia (placebo), myocardial infarction (placebo), asthma 
(omalizumab), snake bite (omalizumab), and hand fracture (omalizumab). 
Adverse events of special interest 
Potential cases of anaphylaxis (anaphylactic, anaphylactoid, and hypersensitivity reactions) were to be 
identified and sent for adjudication by an independent anaphylaxis adjudication Committee (AAC). 
There were no such cases recorded in the studies.  
Events that have been previously identified as risks associated with omalizumab from the overall 
safety database and prescribing information (anaphylaxis, serum sickness syndrome, antibody 
formation to omalizumab, confirmed Churg Strauss syndrome and hypereosinophilic syndrome, 
thrombocytopenia, ATEs, malignancies, and parasitic infections) were to be summarized separately. 
There were no such cases recorded in the studies.  
Laboratory findings 
Haematology values were assessed by visit (baseline, Weeks 16, 24 and Week 28/SFU), and change 
from baseline. At Week 24, there was an increase in mean percent eosinophils assessed from baseline 
in the placebo arm (1.445 % and 1.127 % resp. mean change from baseline for placebo versus -
0.264% and 0.497 % for omalizumab), however these changes did not result in any manifestations 
and/or sequelae. There were no shifts >grade 2 post-baseline for haematology parameter assessed 
and no patient developed abnormal platelet values post-baseline.   
Serum chemistry were measured at screening (Day−35), baseline, Week 24 and Week 28/SFU. Values 
were assessed by visit and change from baseline. Overall there were no clinically relevant mean 
changes from baseline observed in either treatment arm for the chemistry values assessed. There 
were no cases of drug-induced liver injury which included an elevated Alanine aminotransaminase 
(ALT) or Aspartate aminotransaminase (AST) in combination with either an elevated bilirubin or clinical 
jaundice, as defined by Hy’s Law. One patient in the omalizumab treatment arm in study GA39688 
developed grade 3 ALT and grade 2 AST values at Week 24 (Study Day 169), although this was not in 
combination with elevated total bilirubin (i.e. >2 × ULN) and the patient had no signs of clinical 
EMA/404869/2020  
Page 66/78 
 
  
 
 
jaundice. The patient was reported with autoimmune hepatitis; the investigator considered this event 
unrelated to omalizumab treatment and possibly a pre-existing (autoimmune hepatitis; 
hemochromatosis mutation) condition which was detected during the scheduled chemistry testing. The 
patient was first diagnosed with elevated liver enzymes following laboratory work-up on Study Day 
169, but this diagnosis was subsequently updated to non-serious autoimmune hepatitis (moderate 
intensity) following a liver biopsy, performed 26 days later. The liver biopsy indicated moderate 
fibrosis. The investigator thought that the event developed slowly prior to study participation and the 
routine lab follow-up per study protocol picked up the AST and ALT elevations as the disease 
progressed. Reportedly, AST and ALT were both normal during the initial screening chemistry panel 
(see table below), but by week 24 they began to be elevated. 
A summary of vital signs (pulse rate and blood pressure) values at each visit, change from baseline at 
each visit, as well as the minimum and maximum post-baseline and change from baseline values is 
provided. No clinically relevant mean changes from baseline in systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic 
blood pressure (DBP), or pulse rate were noted in either treatment arm. 
Anti-drug antibodies 
ADA testing was not planned per protocol unless the investigator suspected ADA formation and 
prescribed ADA testing. No events suggesting antibody formation to omalizumab were identified in the 
two pivotal studies.  
Safety in special populations 
To evaluate the impact of patient age on the safety of omalizumab in patients with nasal polyps, AE 
data were analysed in patient subgroups aged <65 years and ≥ 65 years (elderly patients). Overall, 7 
of 20 elderly patients in the omalizumab arm (35.0%), compared with 12 of 20 elderly patients in the 
placebo arm (60.0%) reported one or more AEs. The higher incidence of AEs in the placebo arm was 
mainly driven by an increased incidence of AEs in the SOC of respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal 
disorders (placebo 6 patients, 30.0%; omalizumab 1 patient, 5.0%). 
To evaluate the impact of concomitant asthma disease and of aspirin sensitivity on the safety of 
omalizumab, AE data were analysed in patient subgroups with asthma, with asthma and additional 
aspirin sensitivity, and in patients with no asthma at screening. Treatment emergent AEs of asthma 
were generally more common in patients with concurrent asthma at screening (with or without 
additional aspirin sensitivity) than in patients without asthma. There was also a slight trend for more 
injection site reactions reported in patients with asthma (with or without additional aspirin sensitivity) 
versus patients without asthma. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No formal drug interaction studies have been performed with omalizumab. In the nasal polyp studies, 
omalizumab was used in conjunction with intranasal mometasone spray per protocol. Other commonly 
used concomitant medications included other intranasal corticosteroids, bronchodilators, 
antihistamines, leukotriene receptor antagonists, adrenergics/sympathomimetics, and local nasal 
anaesthetics. There was no indication that the safety of omalizumab was altered with these other 
commonly used medications, which are the current standard of care for patients with nasal polyps. 
EMA/404869/2020  
Page 67/78 
 
  
 
 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
No AE leading to discontinuation occurred in omalizumab treated patients in the pivotal trials. During 
the OLE study, 1 patient discontinued open-label omalizumab treatment due to a nonserious TEAE of 
pruritus, which occurred 7 days after the first dose of open-label omalizumab. In addition, the patient 
with autoimmune hepatitis recorded in study GA39688 discontinued after inclusion to the OLE-study. 
Post marketing experience 
Based on the extensive post-marketing experience from approved indications (>1 million patient years 
of exposure), the general safety profile of omalizumab has been well established. The important risks 
are well characterised and routine risk management applies (see Risk Management Plan section 2.6. ).  
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The overall safety profile of omalizumab has been well-characterized in the current authorised 
indications i.e. treatment of allergic asthma in children (≥ 6 years), adolescents and adults, and 
treatment of CSU in adolescents (≥ 12 years) and adults. The estimated cumulative omalizumab 
exposure is >16,000 patients in clinical trials and >1 million patient years in the post-marketing 
setting, as of 31 December 2018.  
The safety database for the new indication consists of data from the two pivotal clinical trials GA39688 
and GA39855. Both studies had identical inclusion and exclusion criteria, study assessments, and 
safety endpoints; therefore, pooling of safety data is considered acceptable. Supportive data from an 
interim analysis of the ongoing, OLE study (WA40169) are also included; with a clinical data cut-off 
date of 11 March 2019, which is the date of last patient enrolled in the OLE study.  
In the two pivotal studies, a total of 135 patients received omalizumab, and 130 patients received 
placebo. A total of 249 patients from the completed pivotal studies enrolled into the OLE study 
WA40169 and started open-label omalizumab treatment (parent study drug treatment received: 
omalizumab 124, placebo 125).  
The safety database presented with this application is considered to be relatively small. Considering 
the relative similarity between the patient population with nasal polyps and the patient population with 
allergic asthma, it is considered acceptable to extrapolate the safety from the existing safety database 
(pre and post-approval).  
In the pooled analysis of the two pivotal studies, the adverse events recorded were generally mild and 
recorded in similar numbers in the omalizumab and placebo groups (50.4% versus 58.5%). The only 
obvious imbalances are injection site reactions and asthma which is expected. Injection site reactions 
are listed with the frequency “common” in the approved SmPC and the unbalance for asthma can be 
attributed to the fact that approximately half of the population had asthma as co-morbidity at 
inclusion. There were no unexpected findings presented in the OLE interim report. The pattern of 
adverse events presented in the interim analysis are similar to the findings in the pivotal trials and 
consistent with the known safety pattern for Xolair. 
Section 4.8 of the SmPC has been updated to reflect that arthralgia was more common in the nasal 
polyps trial.  
No deaths occurred in the pooled analysis (studies GA39688 and GA39855) and in the ongoing OLE 
study WA40169. 
EMA/404869/2020  
Page 68/78 
 
  
 
 
There were no cases of anaphylaxis (anaphylactic, anaphylactoid, and hypersensitivity reactions) 
recorded in the pivotal studies or in the OLE study (safety interim report). It can be anticipated that 
the frequency of anaphylaxis is similar to that in the already approved populations. Other rare events 
such as serum sickness syndrome, Churg Strauss syndrome/hypereosinophilic syndrome and idiopathic 
thrombocytopenia were not recorded in the studies, nor were any parasitic infections. Due to the 
limited size of the clinical safety database, occurrence/frequency of such events could nevertheless not 
be estimated but are probably independent of population. Anaphylaxis and Churg Strauss 
Syndrome/hypereosinophilic syndrome are well described in the Xolair EU SmPC and well managed 
through routine pharmacovigilance measures as described in the RMP. Furthermore, no change in 
frequency and severity of these risks has been observed during the periodic evaluation in the PSURs. 
Therefore, no further actions were deemed warranted in the present application.  
There was one case of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) reported during the clinical studies. As AIH is 
currently not listed in section 4.8 of the SmPC, the MAH was requested to present the case in more 
detail and discuss possible relation with omalizumab treatment. Based on the data provided by the 
MAH, the CHMP considered that a causal association between omalizumab and AIH is considered 
unlikely and that the single case recorded in the study does not warrant further regulatory action. 
Thus, there is no need to update section 4.8 of the SmPC. The MAH should nevertheless closely 
monitor ‘autoimmune hepatitis’ in future PSURs. 
ADA testing was not planned per protocol unless the investigator suspected ADA formation and 
prescribed ADA testing. Furthermore, no events suggesting antibody formation to omalizumab were 
identified in the two pivotal studies. Antibody formation to omalizumab is already listed as an adverse 
drug reaction in section 4.8 of the SmPC (frequency rare). Differences in antibody formation between 
the approved indications and patients with nasal polyposis are not expected.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The overall safety profile as recorded in the two pivotal clinical studies supports the known safety 
profile of the product with injection site reactions being the only obvious unbalance vs placebo. The 
amount of data is nevertheless too limited to allow for any estimation of occurrence/frequency of more 
rare adverse reactions. Thus, the conclusion on safety relies mainly on the previously known safety 
data on omalizumab in the currently approved indications. Nevertheless, longer-term safety data will 
be available from the ongoing OLE study. 
Furthermore, the MAH was requested to closely monitor ‘autoimmune hepatitis’ (AIH) in future PSURs.  
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have 
been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template which were 
accepted by the CHMP. 
In addition, the list of local representatives in the PL has been revised to amend contact details for the 
representative of NL. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable, because the proposed changes 
are minor and not considered to significantly affect the readability of the package leaflet. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) is a heterogeneous disease characterized by 
inflammation of the nose and paranasal sinuses, tissue oedema, nasal obstruction, and increased 
mucus production causing symptoms including nasal congestion/obstruction, loss of sense of smell, 
and rhinorrhoea that persist for at least 12 week. 
It is a predominantly adult disease with a prevalence estimated to be 2.1% to 2.7%. It is associated 
both with reduced quality of life (QoL) and significant morbidity, including asthma, which can be severe 
and refractory, particularly in those patients with aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease. The 
diagnosis is made in patients who exhibit a combination of symptoms with the presence of nasal 
polyps. 
Patients with CRSwNP and many patients with allergic asthma share a common IgE-mediated type 2 
inflammatory response, characterized by elevated levels of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, eosinophils, Th2 cells, 
and type 2 innate lymphoid cells. Histological examination usually shows mixed infiltrates of 
mononuclear cells and eosinophils. In addition, locally produced IgE against staphylococcal 
enterotoxins, is associated with local inflammation in CRSwNP and, in particular, with comorbid 
asthma. Approximately 20%−40% of patients with asthma have CRSwNP, particularly those patients 
with severe asthma. A substantial proportion of patients with CRSwNP have symptoms of asthma, with 
higher percentages associated with patients who have greater nasal polyp disease severity. There 
appears to be a premorbid relationship between asthma and CRSwNP, with the diagnosis of asthma 
often occurring prior to that of nasal polyposis. 
Nasal polyposis is not a potential fatal condition, but severe polyposis can contribute to symptoms and 
conditions associated with a substantial impact on quality of life and health.

3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Intranasal and systemic/oral corticosteroids is the main treatment of nasal polyps. When these 
treatments are insufficient, i.e. in patients with severe disease, surgery, like Functional Endoscopic 
Sinus Surgery (FESS) and other sinus surgeries, can be performed. Although FESS and intranasal and 
systemic/oral corticosteroids are useful and often effective in reducing the size of nasal polyps, polyps 
return after medication withdrawal and within months to years following surgery. 
There is a monoclonal antibody approved for treatment of nasal polyposis dupilumab which acts 
against IL4-receptor alpha that inhibits IL-4/IL-13 signalling. Interleukins 4 and 13 affects both 
eosinophils and IgE-levels. It is indicated as add-on therapy in adults with severe CRSwNP for whom 
therapy with systemic corticosteroids and/or surgery has not provided adequate disease control. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The efficacy and safety of omalizumab in nasal polyps is supported by two identical phase-III, 
randomized, multi-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 24 weeks performed in 
patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (GA39688 and GA39855). Both pivotal studies 
included adult patients with nasal polyps whose disease remained inadequately controlled despite daily 
treatment with intranasal corticosteroids.  
Changes from baseline to Week 24 in NPS and the average daily NCS were co-primary endpoints. 
Nasal polyp score is decided with intranasal endoscopy and right and left sides are assessed separately 
on a scale from 0 to 4 (total maximum 8). Nasal congestion score (0 to 3) is based on daily patient 
reports using the mean value of the last 7 days.  
Secondary endpoints were change from baseline at week 24 in the average daily TNSS, a composite 
score, change from baseline at week 24 in patient–reported HRQoL as assessed by total SNOT-22, 
change from baseline at week 24 in UPSIT, change from baseline at week 16 in NPS and in the 
average daily NCS and requirement of rescue treatment (systemic CS for ≥ 3 consecutive days) 
through week 24. TNSS grades four symptoms, sneezing, congestion, itching and rhinorrhoea. Each 
symptom is graded from 0-3 (3 being the worst). SNOT-22 (0-110 points) is a validated questionnaire 
of disease specific, quality of life related measures of sinonasal function which has been validated to 
show a minimal clinical important difference (MCID) of 8.9 or more. Seven or lower is considered 
normal. UPSIT is a test for smell identification to test the function of an individual's olfactory system 
with the worst being 0 and the best being 40. These scores were patient reported. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In both pivotal Phase-III studies (GA39688 and GA39855), the co-primary endpoints of the changes 
from baseline at Week 24 in NPS and the average daily NCS were met. For each of the co-primary 
endpoints, the between-treatment difference in the adjusted mean changes at Week 24 was 
statistically significant in favour of omalizumab (p-value of <0.05 in both studies for both co-primary 
endpoints). 
At baseline, the participants had a mean NPS (range 0-8) of 6.21 in the placebo group compared to 
6.31 in the omalizumab treatment arm (pooled data). Both groups improved with 0.13 resp. 0.99, 
nominal p<0.0001 for pooled data. For NCS (range 0-3), the inclusion criterion was ≥2 at baseline and 
the treatment groups had 2.38 (placebo) resp. 2.34 (omalizumab) at baseline. Both groups improved 
with 0.28 resp. 0.80, nominal p<0.0001 for pooled data. Thus, the primary objectives to show 
superiority of omalizumab to placebo were formally met.  
EMA/404869/2020  
Page 73/78 
 
  
 
 
For the secondary efficacy endpoints TNSS, SNOT-22 and UPSIT, omalizumab showed improvement 
compared to placebo (all three endpoints had a p-value of <0.05 in both studies and the nominal p-
value for the pooled data was p<0.0001). Approximately 40% of the patients in the placebo arms and 
70% of the patients in the omalizumab arms had a change of at least 8.9 points in SNOT-22. The 
adjusted mean (SE) for the change in SNOT-22 at week 24 compared to baseline was -7.73(1.51) in 
the pooled placebo arm, i.e. below the threshold for clinical relevance, but -23.10(1.50) in the pooled 
omalizumab group. 
The MAH presented an adequate literature review contextualizing the results of both co-primary 
endpoints (NPS and NCS). The effect level appears similar to intranasal corticosteroids in the 
responding population which is deemed clinically relevant. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The choice of dosing regimen was initially not fully discussed in comparison with allergic asthma and 
chronic spontaneous urticaria. However, similar pathophysiological mechanisms in allergic asthma and 
nasal polyposis; and similar mechanism of action of omalizumab supported the choice of dosing 
regimen and the proposed information included in the product information.  
The chosen statistical method is a MMRM together with failure imputation for patients with intercurrent 
events. It is not apparent that the handling of intercurrent events and missing data provides a 
conservative estimate of the treatment effect. The number of intercurrent events by type and 
treatment group together with the observed and imputed data were presented by the MAH. The 
numbers are low and the impact on the estimate of treatment effect was considered to be minor.  
The sample size calculations were based on a 0.56 point difference for NCS and 1.50 for NPS. These 
differences were not achieved. However, omalizumab was statistically significantly better than placebo 
in both pivotal studies and both co-primary endpoints, and the effect size was considered clinically 
relevant when put into context by a literature review presented by the MAH. The effect level as 
compared with other biologicals remain uncertain as there are no directly comparing studies. The point 
estimates of effect appeared higher in dupilumab studies, but these studies had different enrolment 
criteria with respect to requirement for prior surgeries and systemic steroids, differences in populations 
enrolled, and other differences in study conduct.  
There were no differences recorded for the secondary endpoint Requirement of rescue treatment 
(systemic corticosteroids ≥3 consecutive days or nasal polypectomy) between omalizumab and 
placebo, these results should nevertheless be interpreted with caution as there were few events and 
the study was short (24 weeks). 
The long-term efficacy is an uncertainty as CRSwNP is a chronic lifelong disease and the current 
efficacy data remain limited over long term.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Of the 135 patients (corresponding to a total of 51.5 patient-years) who received omalizumab during 
the two Phase III Studies GA39688 and GA39855, 7 (5.2%) experienced injection site reactions to be 
compared with 2 patients (1.5 %) treated with placebo. All other adverse events were recorded in 
similar numbers in the omalizumab and placebo group respectively. There were no severe events 
recorded that could be attributed to omalizumab treatment. 
One of the known serious adverse events of omalizumab is anaphylactic reactions. There were no such 
cases recorded in the pivotal studies or in the OLE study presented with this application. It can be 
EMA/404869/2020  
Page 74/78 
 
  
 
 
anticipated that the frequency of anaphylaxis is similar to that in the already approved populations. 
Anaphylactic reaction is currently listed as an adverse reaction with a frequency ‘rare’ in section 4.8 of 
the SmPC and adequate warnings have already been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC. Therefore, 
no further actions are deemed warranted. Other rare events such as serum sickness syndrome, Churg 
Strauss syndrome/hypereosinophilic syndrome and idiopathic thrombocytopenia were not recorded in 
these studies, nor were any parasitic infections. Due to the limited size of the clinical safety database, 
occurrence/frequency of such events could nevertheless not be estimated but are probably 
independent of population.  
Section 4.8 of the SmPC has been updated to reflect that arthralgia was more common in the nasal 
polyps studies.  
There was one case of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) reported during the clinical studies. As AIH is 
currently not listed in section 4.8 of the SmPC, the MAH was requested to present the case in more 
detail and discuss possible relation with omalizumab treatment. Based on the data provided by the 
MAH, the CHMP considered that a causal association between omalizumab and AIH is considered 
unlikely and that the single case recorded in the study does not warrant further regulatory action. 
Thus, there is no need to update section 4.8 of the SmPC. Nevertheless, the MAH was requested to 
closely monitor ‘autoimmune hepatitis’ in the post-marketing setting i.e. future PSURs.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Long-term safety experience is limited in CRSwNP patients as the majority of the safety data (from the 
pooled analysis) comes from 24 weeks of data. Long-term safety data will be provided with the 
submission of the final study report of the currently ongoing OLE study (WA40169). 
Due to the size of the database, the occurrence/frequency of rare events could not be estimated based 
on observed data in patients treated with omalizumab for nasal polyps. Thus, the safety profile was 
extrapolated partly from the already approved indications.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Omalizumab was studied as an add-on therapy to intranasal corticosteroids (INC) in adult patients with 
severe CRSwNP for whom therapy with INC had not provide adequate disease control. 
Nasal polyposis is not a potential fatal condition, but severe polyposis can contribute to symptoms and 
conditions associated with a substantial impact on quality of life and health.  
In the pivotal studies presented, GA39688 and GA39855, statistical significance was reached for the 2 
co-primary efficacy endpoints (change from baseline in NPS and NCS at Week 24). Thus, the primary 
objectives to show superiority of omalizumab to placebo were met. These results were overall 
supported by secondary endpoints (TNSS, SNOT-22 and UPSIT) investigated. The clinical relevance of 
omalizumab in the treatment of adult patients with severe CRSwNP who have inadequate response to 
intranasal corticosteroids has been further discussed and contextualised by the MAH and is considered 
sufficiently justified with respect to clinical relevance. The effect seems to be of the same magnitude as 
for intranasal corticosteroids. The effect may be less pronounced compared to dupilumab based on 
cross study comparison. However, there are no directs comparisons. 
Overall, omalizumab was well tolerated in the target population of patients with severe nasal polyps 
who have inadequate response to intranasal corticosteroids, and generally consistent with the 
established safety profile in patients with currently approved indications in allergic asthma and CSU. 
No new or unexpected safety signals were observed in the nasal polyps population.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
There is a documented effect of omalizumab over placebo in patients with severe chronic rhinosinusitis 
with nasal polyps with improvements within the range of other available treatment options. This 
benefit is to be weighed against a well-known and rather benign safety profile of the drug which as 
previously been found acceptable for asthma and CSU.  
Based on the data provided on efficacy and safety, the CHMP considers that the favourable effects 
outweigh the unfavourable effects.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit/risk balance 
The initially proposed indication (Xolair is indicated for the treatment of nasal polyps in adult patients 
(18 years and above) with inadequate response to intranasal corticosteroids) was considered to be too 
EMA/404869/2020  
Page 76/78 
 
  
 
 
 
broad and not sufficiently covered by the data provided. The studied population was considered to 
represent patients with severe disease based on baseline severity scores.  
The indication granted by CHMP was therefore as an add-on therapy with intranasal corticosteroids 
(INC) for the treatment of adults (18 years and above) with severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal 
polyps (CRSwNP) for whom therapy with INC does not provide adequate disease control. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Xolair for the treatment of adults (18 years and above) with severe 
CRSwNP for whom therapy with INC does not provide adequate disease control is positive.  
4.  Recommendations

Extension of indication to include Xolair as an add-on therapy with intranasal corticosteroids (INC) for 
the treatment of adults (18 years and above) with severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps for 
whom therapy with INC does not provide adequate disease control; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 
4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet (PL) is updated in 
accordance. In addition, the list of local representatives in the PL has been revised to amend contact 
details for the representative of the Netherlands. Furthermore, the product information is brought in 
line with the latest QRD template version 10.1. The risk management plan version 16.0 has also been 
agreed.  
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annexes I, II and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended.

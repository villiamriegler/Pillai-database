Summary of risk management plan for ZEPOSIA 
(ozanimod) 
This is a summary of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for Zeposia. The RMP details important 
risks of Zeposia, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained 
about Zeposia’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Zeposia’s  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet  give  essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Zeposia should be used.  
This  summary  of  the  RMP  for  Zeposia  should  be  read  in  the  context  of  all  this  information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part 
of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Zeposia’s 
RMP. 
I.  The medicine and what it is used for 
Zeposia is authorised for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis 
(MS) with active disease, and for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active 
ulcerative colitis (UC) who have had an inadequate response, lost response or were intolerant to 
either  conventional  therapy  or  a  biologic  agent  (see  SmPC  for  the  full  indication).  It  contains 
ozanimod as the active substance and it is given by oral route of administration.  
Further information about the evaluation of Zeposia’s benefits can be found in Zeposia’s EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the European Medicines Agency website, 
under the medicine’s webpage. 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or 
further characterise the risks  
Important risks of Zeposia, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies 
for learning more about Zeposia’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package 
leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
• 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with or without 
prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In  the  case  of  Zeposia,  these  measures  are  supplemented  with  additional  risk  minimisation 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
 
 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including Periodic Safety Update Report assessment, so that immediate action 
can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Zeposia is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important  risks  of  Zeposia  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to  further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important risks 
can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient 
proof of a link with the use of Zeposia. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with 
the  use  of  this  medicine  is  possible  based  on  available  data,  but  this  association  has  not  been 
established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information  refers  to  information  on  the 
safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (eg, on the long-
term use of the medicine).

Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimisation measures 
A case of PML (a rare infection of the brain) has been observed with ozanimod 
treatment  in  the  MS  clinical  trial  RPC01-3001,  open-label  extension  (OLE) 
study. 
Patients  with  prolonged  and  profound  lymphopaenia  (reduced  white  blood 
cells) may  be at  increased  risk  of developing  severe  opportunistic infection, 
including  PML,  and  also  those  who  have  received  previous  natalizumab 
treatment, although the risks appear to be very low. 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
SmPC Sections 4.3, 4.4, and 4.8. 
Package Leaflet (PL) Sections 2 and 4. 
Ozanimod is contraindicated in patients with severe active infections, active 
chronic infections such as hepatitis and tuberculosis (SmPC Section 4.3). 
Recommendation to discontinue ozanimod if PML is confirmed is included in 
SmPC Section 4.4.  
Recommendation that discontinuation of ozanimod be considered in case of 
opportunistic infection, is included in SmPC Section 4.4. 
Recommendations to measure blood cell counts prior to and during treatment 
with ozanimod, advice to monitor patients at risk of infection, clinical 
symptoms or magnetic resonance imaging findings that physicians should be 
vigilant for signs suggestive of PML, treatment instructions in cases 
suggestive of PML and treatment discontinuation if PML is confirmed are 
provided in SmPC Section 4.4 and PL Section 2. 
Patients are advised not to take ozanimod if they have severe infection and to 
consult their doctor if they develop infections (PL Section 2).  
Patients are advised to consult their doctor or pharmacist before taking 
ozanimod if they notice symptoms that may be due to PML, in PL Section 2.

Important potential risks 
Symptomatic Slow Heart Rate (Symptomatic Bradycardia) 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Initiation of ozanimod may result in transient reductions in HR. A dose 
escalation schedule (0.23 mg ozanimod followed by 0.46 mg and 0.92 mg) 
attenuates the magnitude of HR reductions. Initiation of ozanimod without 
dose escalation may result in greater reductions in HR. Two isolated cases 
of HR < 40 bpm (1 MS, 1 UC) were reported, both of which were detected 
by continuous cardiac monitoring overnight, and neither of which was 
associated with an adverse event (AE) or required treatment.   
In UC clinical studies Induction Period, which implemented dose 
escalation (Pool F), there was a modest (0.7 bpm) maximum mean 
reduction from baseline in HR during the first 6 hours post-dose on Day 1. 
This reduction was not associated with clinically significant bradycardia 
or conduction effects (eg, second-degree type 2 or third-degree 
atrioventricular block). No symptomatic bradycardia occurred during 
controlled studies. During hourly cardiac monitoring, one patient in an 
open-label cohort with a pre-dose HR of 56 bpm experienced headache, 
nausea and light-headedness after the first dose of ozanimod. The lowest 
reported HR was 43 bpm at Hour 2, which recovered to above baseline by 
Hour 5. No treatment or extended monitoring was required. As discussed 
above, two isolated cases of HR < 40 bpm (1 MS, 1 UC) were reported. 
One patient in Study RPC01-202, experienced HR ≤ 40 bpm. The 
patient’s HR during the first 6 hours after dosing on Day 1 (approximately 
9 am to 3 pm) was ≥ 64 bpm, and the patient experienced the minimal HR 
of 38 bpm at 2 am. Over 24-hour Holter monitoring, maximum HR was 
133 bpm and mean HR was 80 bpm. This event was not associated with an 
AE and did not require treatment. 
In  active-controlled  MS  clinical  trials,  after  the  initial  dose  of  ozanimod 
0.23  mg,  the  greatest  mean  reduction  from  baseline  in  HR  of  1.2  bpm 
occurred at Hour 5 on Day 1, returning towards baseline at Hour 6. With 
the  use  of  a  dose  escalation  regimen  over  the  first  7  days  of  treatment 
initiation,  there  has  only  been  one  case  of  confirmed  symptomatic 
bradycardia  observed  in active-controlled  Phase 3  MS  studies  (Pool  A1). 
This patient, with a pre-treatment HR of 48 bpm experienced mild dizziness 
at  Hour 6  on  Day  1,  in  the  presence  of  a  HR  of  47  bpm.  The  dizziness 
resolved after a single dose of atropine although HR remained at 44 bpm. It 
is  likely  that  pre-existing  dysautonomia  contributed  to  the  patient’s 
bradycardia and blunted the HR response to atropine. The patient continued 
ozanimod  treatment  uneventfully.  In  Pool  B,  one further  event  of 
nonserious  symptomatic  bradycardia  was 
in  one patient 
commencing  0.23 mg  ozanimod.  The  patient  experienced  dizziness  and 
sleepiness, with a lowest HR of 46 bpm at Hour 4. The event did not lead 
to dose modification or discontinuation. One patient in Study RPC01-201A, 
had  a  HR  of  39  bpm  at  Hour 20  post-dose  on  Day  8,  which  returned  to 
normal (60 bpm) at Hours 23 and 24 the same day. This occurrence was not 
associated with an AE and did not require treatment. 
Symptomatic bradycardia is a rare occurrence and has not been of clinical 
consequence.  
The  administration  of  ozanimod  in  patients  on both  a  beta blocker and  a 
calcium channel blocker has not been studied. Any reports of symptoms in 
patients  receiving  these  drugs  concurrently  in  clinical  practice  will  be 
analysed.

Severe Liver Injury 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Severe drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is considered to be of public 
health concern. The majority of liver-related events in the ozanimod 
clinical studies (predominately alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and 
gamma glutamyltransferase elevations) were mild to moderate in intensity 
and resolved while continuing treatment. Section 4.4 of the SmPC states 
that elevations of aminotransferases may occur in patients receiving 
ozanimod and advises that recent (ie, within last 6 months) transaminase 
and bilirubin levels should be available before treatment initiation. 
During the Induction Period for UC study RPC01-3101, elevations of 
ALT above 5-fold the upper limit of normal (ULN) occurred in 0.9% of 
patients treated with ozanimod 0.92 mg and 0.5% of patients who received 
placebo. Elevations of ALT above 3-fold the ULN occurred in 2.6% of 
patients treated with ozanimod 0.92 mg and 0.5% of patients who received 
placebo. In the Study RPC01-3101 Maintenance Period, 0.9% of patients 
treated with ozanimod 0.92 mg and no patients who received placebo had 
elevations 5-fold the ULN or greater. Elevations of 3-fold the ULN 
occurred in 2.3% of patients treated with ozanimod 0.92 mg and none who 
received placebo. 
In the UC studies (Pool G), elevations in ALT > 3 × ULN were observed 
in 6.0% of patients treated with ozanimod 0.92 mg and 0.2% of patients 
who received placebo. Of the ozanimod-treated patients, the majority 
(approximately 96% on ozanimod 0.92 mg) continued treatment with 
ozanimod, with values returning to ≤ 3 × ULN within approximately 2 to 
4 weeks. The majority of ALT elevations were isolated cases, as 
evidenced by the low incidence of consecutive elevations > 3 × ULN 
 
 
Important potential risks 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimisation measures 
(2.0% of patients treated with ozanimod 0.92 mg in Pool G) or > 5 × ULN 
(0.3% in Pool G). Similarly, the incidence of total bilirubin elevations > 2 
× ULN was 1.1% in Pool G.  
Two patients in Pool G, had treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) 
reported by the Investigator as DILI. Both patients had mild (≥ 2 × ULN) 
nonserious, but persistent ALT elevations (after starting ozanimod 
treatment in OLE Study RPC01-3102), with ALT returning to near normal 
values (< 1.5 × ULN) with continued ozanimod treatment. The TEAEs 
were not associated with any symptoms or other laboratory changes and 
did not require any treatment. One patient was discontinued from 
Study RPC01-3102 due to persistent ALT elevation; the second patient 
continued in the OLE study.  
Overall, in UC clinical studies, the discontinuation rate due to elevations 
in hepatic enzymes was 0.4% of patients with UC treated with ozanimod 
in both Induction and Maintenance Periods, and none in patients who 
received placebo in either period. 
In active-controlled MS clinical trials, elevations of ALT to 5-fold the 
ULN or greater occurred in 1.6% of patients treated with ozanimod 0.92 
mg and 1.3% of patients on interferon (IFN) β-1a. Elevations of 3-fold the 
ULN or greater occurred in 5.5% of patients treated with ozanimod 0.92 
mg and 3.1% of patients on IFN β-1a. When elevations in hepatic tests 
occurred, they were generally asymptomatic. The median time to elevation 
3-fold the ULN was 6 months. The majority (79%) continued treatment 
with ozanimod with values returning to < 3-fold the ULN within 
approximately 2 to 4 weeks. In active-controlled MS clinical trials, 
ozanimod was discontinued for a confirmed elevation greater than 5-fold 
the ULN. Overall, the discontinuation rate due to elevations in hepatic 
enzymes was 1.1% of patients on ozanimod 0.92 mg and 0.8% of patients 
on IFN β-1a. Although there have been instances (5/1774 [0.28%] patients 
in Pool A1) where observations of ALT or aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST) were ≥ 3-fold the ULN together with bilirubin > 2-fold the ULN in 
clinical trials, no cases of severe DILI (confirmed Hy’s Law cases) were 
observed with ozanimod. 
Ten patients in the entire ozanimod clinical development program (Pool 
D) had concurrent elevations of ALT or AST ≥ 3 × ULN and bilirubin 
> 2 × ULN. Review of unblinded cases by an external panel of expert 
hepatologists concluded that there were no cases that met Hy’s Law due to 
alternate explanations and the pattern of abnormalities. 
Patients with pre-existing liver disease may be at increased risk of 
developing elevated hepatic enzymes when taking ozanimod. However, it 
is not known whether these patients are at increased risk of severe liver 
injury.

Swelling of a Part of the Retina (Macular Oedema) 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
An external review panel identified 3 cases of macular oedema with 
ozanimod 0.92 mg in the UC studies RPC01-202 and RPC01-3101 and 1 
case of cystoid macular oedema with ozanimod 0.92 mg in the UC OLE 
study (Study RPC01-3102). All 4 cases of confirmed macular oedema 
were identified with optical coherence tomography findings consistent 
with macular oedema, and all cases were associated with pre-existing risk 
factors or comorbid conditions that are known to cause macular oedema. 
No trend in central foveal thickness changes was noted over time. All 4 
cases of macular oedema resolved. 
In the MS studies, for Pool A1 there were three confirmed cases in the 
ozanimod 0.46 mg group, one confirmed case in the ozanimod 0.92 mg 
group and none in the IFN β-1a treatment group. In Pool B, there were 
three additional confirmed cases in the extension study RPC01-3001 
(ozanimod 0.92 mg). 
Following adjudication by a panel of ophthalmology experts including two 
neuro-ophthalmologists and a retinal specialist, all seven cases were 
confounded by pre-existing risk factors including a history of macular 
oedema, uveitis, other ocular inflammation, or trauma. In one case, drug 
was continued with recovery. In the remaining six cases, upon drug 
discontinuation, five cases showed full recovery and the case with trauma 
was stable.

Important Potential Risk: Cancer (Malignancy) 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimisation measures 
Malignancies are identified by medical review of all TEAEs (preferred 
terms [PTs]) in the System Organ Class (SOC) Neoplasms benign, 
malignant and unspecified (incl. cysts and polyps) for the UC population. 
Events of colorectal carcinoma and high-grade dysplasia are also 
specifically monitored in the UC population.  
In total, 14 malignancies were observed in the UC studies: 6 NMSCs and 
8 other malignancies. In UC studies (Pool G), malignancies were reported 
in 1.0% of patients in the ozanimod 0.92 mg treatment group and 0.4% in 
the placebo group. Both of the patients in the placebo group had received 
ozanimod during the Induction Period prior to being randomised to 
placebo maintenance. No malignancies were observed for patients 
exclusively exposed to placebo. Similar to MS, the overall incidence of 
malignancies with ozanimod is generally in line with rates reported in the 
literature in the UC population and the general population in the same age 
range. 
In the MS studies, for Pool A1 there were 4 treatment-emergent 
malignancies (excluding NMSCs) for ozanimod (0.46 and 0.92 mg doses) 
and 4 NMSCs versus 1 and 1 for IFN, respectively. In Pool B, there were 
12 treatment-emergent malignancies (excluding NMSCs) for ozanimod 
(0.46 and 0.92 mg doses) and 9 NMSCs versus 1 and 1 for IFN, 
respectively. Incidence rates of malignancies for ozanimod were within 
background rates in age matched MS and general populations. 
Risk factors for malignancies are not fully understood. Risk factors known 
to cause cancer include advancing age, and lifestyle (such as smoking, 
alcohol, certain infections, lack of physical activities, poor diet, obesity, 
excessive exposure to the sun or other radiation, exposure to chemicals or 
hormone replacement). Some genes such as BRCA are known to cause 
cancers (breast, ovarian and prostate). However, it is not known what 
proportion of cancer is caused by faulty genes. Patients who are 
profoundly immunosuppressed are also at increased risk of developing 
malignancy, typically lymphomas. Chronic inflammatory conditions may 
also increase the risk of cancer. Many cancers develop as a result of 
combination of genetics, environmental factors and lifestyle.  
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
SmPC Sections 4.3 and 4.4. 
PL Section 2 
Ozanimod is contraindicated in patients with active malignancies (SmPC 
Section 4.3, PL Section 2). 
Advice regarding monitoring of patients with concurrent conditions or 
known factors, such as previous antineoplastic non-corticosteroid 
immunosuppressive therapy, is included in SmPC Section 4.4.

Syndrome Characterised by Headache, Confusion, Seizures and Visual Loss (Posterior Reversible 
Encephalopathy Syndrome) 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
No cases of PRES were reported in UC clinical studies.  
In controlled MS clinical trials with ozanimod, one case of PRES was 
reported in a patient with Guillain-Barré syndrome. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimisation measures 
Many patients with PRES have comorbidities, which may be severe 
conditions, such as bone marrow or solid organ transplantation, chronic 
renal failure, and chronic hypertension and may be predisposing factors.  
Radiologically, extensive bilateral white matter abnormalities suggestive 
of oedema in the posterior regions of cerebral hemispheres were seen in a 
variety of conditions, including severe hypertension, uraemia, toxaemia of 
pregnancy, use of immunosuppressive drugs (ie, cyclosporine A) and 
cytotoxic agents, including alkylating agents, antimetabolites, mitotic 
inhibitors, antiangiogenic agents and antitumour necrosis factor alpha 
agents, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and erythropoietin. 
Infections and autoimmune disease have also been associated with PRES. 
Hypertension of renal origin has been reported to be a significant cause of 
PRES. Patients with renal dysfunction appear to be at higher risk of 
developing PRES despite only moderate acute elevation of their blood 
pressure. In patients with PRES associated renal disease treated with 
antihypertensive medications, neurological deficits resolved within 
2 weeks. PRES can manifest with acute seizures without an obvious 
prodrome. These patients become seizure free after resolution of the 
imaging abnormalities and they do not require long-term antiepileptic 
therapy.  
PRES in the setting of autonomic dysfunction may also be a complication 
of Guillain-Barré syndrome.  
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
SmPC Section 4.4.

Recommendation to discontinue ozanimod if PRES is suspected is 
included in SmPC Section 4.4.

Toxicity to Unborn Child in Women who have Received Treatment with Ozanimod (Embryofoetal 
Toxicity in Exposed Pregnant Females) 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
A total of 55 events of potential exposure during pregnancy have been 
reported in patients treated with ozanimod across all indications, including 
7 reported for female patients in ozanimod clinical trials for UC and 44 
reported for female patients in ozanimod clinical trials for MS. The 
remaining 4 potential pregnancies in clinical trial participants occurred in 
3 patients with Crohn’s disease and 1 healthy volunteer. 
In addition, there have been 20 pregnancies in partners of male patients 
receiving ozanimod. Of these, there have been 14 live births (7 normal; 5 
premature, including 1 set of twins; and 2 with congenital abnormalities, 
including Hirschsprung’s disease and congenital hydrocele), 1 ongoing 
pregnancy, 1 spontaneous early loss and 5 lost to follow-up. 
Embryofoetal toxicity in exposed pregnant females is considered to be an 
Important Potential Risk due to findings in animal studies. 
Clinical trial patients were instructed to avoid pregnancy during the trials 
and for a period after discontinuing medication as specified in the 
protocol, and to immediately discontinue study medication if pregnancy 
were diagnosed. All exposures occurred during the first trimester of 
pregnancy. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
No specific risk groups or risk factors have been identified.

Advice for women of childbearing potential to use effective contraception 
during treatment, and for at least 3 months after ozanimod treatment 
discontinuation is included in SmPC Sections 4.4 and 4.6, and PL 
Section 2. Ozanimod is contraindicated during pregnancy and in women 
of childbearing potential not using effective contraception, a negative 
pregnancy test must be available in women of childbearing potential 
before starting treatment, and counselling information regarding the 
serious risk to the foetus (SmPC Sections 4.4 and 4.6, and PL Section 2) 
and ultrasonography examinations should be provided (SmPC Section 4.6 
and PL Section 2). 
Instruction not to use ozanimod during pregnancy, or in women of 
childbearing potential not using effective contraception, and advice for 
women of childbearing potential, are provided in PL Section 2. 
If a woman becomes pregnant during treatment, treatment should be 
discontinued, and the woman should receive pre-natal monitoring (SmPC 
Section 4.6 and PL Section 2).

In the ozanimod UC clinical development programme, the incidence rate 
(IR) per 1000 person-years for thromboembolic (TE) related events was 
5.2 and 4.0 for ozanimod and placebo, respectively. The majority of the 
TE events occurred in older aged patients with documented risk factors. 
In MS controlled Phase 3 relapsing remitting MS studies (Pool A1), the 
incidence of TE events were similar in ozanimod and IFN β-1a groups, 
with events reported in 2 patients in the ozanimod 1 mg treatment group, 3 
patients in the ozanimod 0.5 mg group and 4 patients with IFN β-1a. The 
majority of the TE events occurred in patients with documented risk 
factors. 
Elderly age, prolonged hospitalisation/immobilisation, cancer, thyroid 
disease, oral contraceptive use, surgery, and pre-existing cardiovascular 
disease including prior DVT/ischaemia, phlebitis or 
cerebrovascular ischaemic attack, and hypertension are risk factors for TE 
events. The risk of thromboembolism is also increased with inflammatory 
bowel disease. Lifestyle factors, including smoking, physical inactivity 
and increased weight are also associated with increased risk of TE events. 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
Use of ozanimod is contraindicated in patients who in the previous 6 
months had a myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris, 
stroke/transient ischaemic attack, decompensated heart failure (requiring 
inpatient treatment), or New York Heart Association Class III/IV heart 
failure (SmPC Section 4.3). Blood pressure should be regularly monitored 
during treatment with ozanimod (SmPC Section 4.4).

Risk of colorectal cancer (UC indication) 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Colorectal cancer and events indicative of advanced colonic neoplasia 
(including colon adenomas and dysplasia) are identified by medical 
review of all TEAEs (PTs) in the SOC Neoplasms benign, malignant and 
unspecified (incl. cysts and polyps) and the Gastrointestinal SOC, for the 
UC population.  
In Pool G, 3 cases of colorectal cancer (CRC) were reported in the 
RPC01-3101 Maintenance Period, including 2 patients in the ozanimod

1 mg treatment group and in 1 patient re-randomised to the placebo 
treatment group during the Maintenance Period.  
Overall, in Pool G, colon adenoma was reported in 5 patients (including 
4 patients on ozanimod treatment and 1 patient re-randomised to placebo 
in the RPC01-3101 Maintenance Period). Colon dysplasia was reported in 
1 patient on placebo. 
Patients with chronic inflammatory bowel conditions such as UC are at 
increased risk of CRC and advanced colonic neoplasia.  
Risk factors for CRC among UC patients include younger age at onset, 
extensive colitis, longer disease duration, concomitant primary sclerosing 
cholangitis, family history of CRC, and persisting inflammation of the 
colon. Patients with extensive colitis have a 3-fold increase in risk of CRC 
and a 5-fold increase for those with long-standing extensive colitis.  
Many cancers also develop as a result of a combination of genetics, 
environmental factors and lifestyle. General risk factors known to cause 
cancer include advancing age and lifestyle (such as smoking, alcohol, 
certain infections, lack of physical activities, poor diet, obesity, excessive 
exposure to other radiation, exposure to chemicals or hormone 
replacement).

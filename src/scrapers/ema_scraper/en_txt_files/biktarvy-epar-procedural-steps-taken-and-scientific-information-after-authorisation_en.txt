Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
Biktarvy in the approved indication remains favourable and 
therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing

Final efficacy and safety data from studies GS-US-380-
to include efficacy and safety data for antiretroviral 
therapy (ART)-naive adults based on final results 
from interventional studies GS-US-380-1489 (A 
Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind Study to 
Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of GS-
9883/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Alafenamide Versus 
Abacavir /Dolutegravir /Lamivudine in HIV-1 
Infected, Antiretroviral Treatment-Naive Adults) and 
1489 and GS-US-380-1490 in ART-naive adults through 96 
weeks of open-label treatment on Biktarvy (BVY) following 
144 weeks of a double-blinded phase (BVY vs 
ABC/DTG/3TC in study GS-US-380-1489 or BVY vs 
DTG+F/TAF in study GS-US-380-1490) were submitted.

In addition, the MAH took this opportunity to 
introduce some minor administrative updates. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to

data 
DTG+F/TAF to BVY at the end of the double-blinded phase 
(i.e. virologically-suppressed subjects with a DTG-based 
first line regimen) demonstrate that, overall, BVY is 
associated with a long-term efficacy, without resistance 
emerging concern.  
Of note, the population of this study (and therefore the 
current therapeutic indication of BVY) was mainly without 
INSTI, FTC and TAF resistance, thus these efficacy data of 
BVY may not be extrapolated for the treatment of subjects 
who already experienced virological failure. 
No new safety concern emerged since the previous 
assessment of the Week 144 data: the long-term safety 
data of BVY are consistent with its known safety profile, 
notably as regards the hepatic and renal effects. 
Sections 4.8 and 5.1  of the SmPC were updated to reflect 
the final results from GS-US-380-1489 and GS-US-380-
1490 efficacy and safety studies.

On days of haemodialysis, administer the daily dose of 
Biktarvy after completion of haemodialysis treatment. In 
addition, initiation of Biktarvy should be avoided in patients 
with estimated creatinine clearance ≥15 mL/min and < 30 
mL/min, or < 15 mL/min who are not receiving chronic 
haemodialysis, as the safety of Biktarvy has not been

No efficacy or safety concerns were raised on this sub-

comparator arm in subjects with baseline HIV-1 RNA > 
100,000 copies/mL or CD4 cell count < 200 cells/μl already 
identified at week 48 is still apparent at week 96. Those 
subgroup analyses have been updated with 96-week data. 
No subject in any group developed treatment-emergent 
resistance to study drugs.  
The safety profile of Biktarvy at Week 96 did not differ from 
that at Week 48, and overall remains similar to 
dolutegravir+emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide. No new 
safety findings have been identified. Based on 96-week 
data sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated 
accordingly.

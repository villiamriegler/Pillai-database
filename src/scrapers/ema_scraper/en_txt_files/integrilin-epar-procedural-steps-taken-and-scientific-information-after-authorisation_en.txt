in patients with impaired renal function, based on the 
PL 
results of a controlled pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic 
study in patients with varying levels of renal function and 
post-hoc analyses of controlled clinical trials. By reducing 
the standard infusion dose of eptifibatide from 2.0 
µg/kg/min to 1.0 µg/kg/min in patients with moderate 
renal impairment (i.e. CrCl 30-50 ml/min), appropriate 
therapeutic exposures to eptifibatide were achieved, while 
maintaining the efficacy as measured by inhibition of 
platelet aggregation. Review of clinical trial safety data

related to bleeding showed that patients with moderate 
renal impairment who received reduced eptifibatide dose 
had a lower risk of bleeding. 
This recommendation and posology in patients with 
moderate renal impairment has been added in section 4.2 
of the SPC  and the current contraindication in patients with 
severe renal impairment in section 4.3 has been clarified 
accordingly. Further information on the pharmacokinetic 
properties of eptifibatide in patients with moderate to 
severe renal insufficiency has been added to section 5.2 of 
the SPC. 
A letter to inform healthcare professionals of the changes 
with the updated SPC has been sent following the adoption 
of this opinion by the CHMP.

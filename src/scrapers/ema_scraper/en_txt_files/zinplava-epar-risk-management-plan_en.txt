EU RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN (RMP) FOR 
Bezlotoxumab 
Intravenous
RMP version to be assessed as part of this application:
RMP Version number: 3.0
Data lock point for this RMP: 31-MAY-2022
Date of finalization:  27-SEP-2023
Rationale for submitting an updated RMP: 
This RMP is being updated with the submission of the extension of indication to include 
paediatric patients 1 year of age and older. The final study data from MK-6072 Protocol 001 
are included in section S.III.2 Clinical Trial Exposure. There are no new safety concerns.
This RMP also is being updated per EMA GVP Module V (Rev.2) RMP template guidance
to remove immunogenicity as an important potential risk.
Summary of significant changes in this RMP: 
The missing information ‘exposure in patients <18 years of age’ has been removed to reflect 
the results of the paediatric study MK-6072 P001.
The RMP risks for bezlotoxumab were evaluated based upon EMA GVP Module V (Rev 2) 
guidance and significant changes are reflected in Module SVII.2. The MAH proposes the 
removal of the important potential risk of ‘immunogenicity’ from the list of safety concerns.

Brief description of the product
Chemical class: 
Bezlotoxumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeted against 
Clostridioides difficile (previously known as Clostridium difficile) toxin B.  
Bezlotoxumab belongs to the IgG1/kappa isotype subclass.
Summary of mode of action: 
Bezlotoxumab binds with high affinity to C. difficile toxin B (Kds = 19 and 370 
pM in a two-site binding model).  Bezlotoxumab prevents the binding of toxin B 
to its target host cells, blocking the cellular intoxication cascade at its first step, 
and averting the damage and inflammation that normally lead to the symptoms of 
C. difficile infection.  
Important information about its composition:
Method of manufacture: recombinant
Biological source: The Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) host cell line CHOK1SV 
was used for expression of bezlotoxumab.
Bezlotoxumab drug product is a clear to moderately opalescent, colorless to pale 
yellow liquid at a target concentration of 25 mg/mL bezlotoxumab mAb in 150 
mM NaCl, 20 mM sodium citrate, 20 µM diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid 
(DTPA), 0.025% (w/v) polysorbate 80 (PS-80), pH 6.0.

PART II: SAFETY SPECIFICATION
PART II: MODULE SI - EPIDEMIOLOGY OF THE INDICATION(S) AND 
TARGET POPULATION(S)
Indication:  Prevention of recurrence of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) in adult and 
paediatric patients 1 year of age and older at high risk for recurrence of CDI 
CDI epidemiology among adults
CDI is a significant health problem that is associated with morbidity and mortality, relatively 
high recurrences [Ref. 5.4: 044763]. CDI is the most common HCAI in Europe and the 
United States and one of the most common HCAI elsewhere where the rate of such infections 
is not routinely tracked [Ref. 5.4: 044763, 046KS0, 046PJK, 046PJM, 03R67D]. 
Incidence of CDI:
From the 1970s to approximately 2010, the incidence of CDI in Europe, the United States,
and other countries increased [Ref. 5.4: 046KR2, 046PJM]. In the US, a decline in 
healthcare-associated infections led to a 24% reduction in CDI cases from 2011 to 2017
[Ref. 5.4: 0829W8]. Similarly, in the UK, the rate of all CDI cases per 100,000 population, 
per year has fallen from 107.6 in 2007-2008 to 22.1 in 2018-2019 [Ref. 5.4: 05KCK0]. In a 
representative study of the U.S. population, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) reported the estimated incidence of CDI in 2011 was 147.2 per 100,000 people and 
the estimated number of cases was approximately 450,000. The majority (57%) of all 
estimated U.S. CDI cases were in patients 65 years old and older: 66% of healthcare-
associated CDI and 72% of CDI recurrences were in those 65 years old and older 
[Ref. 5.4: 046PJM]. In many other countries, the incidence of CDI is reported based on an 
inpatient population. In Canada, the incidence in 2007 was 5.35 per 1,000 admissions with an 
estimated 38,000 cases of CDI [Ref. 5.4: 0479W6]. In 2011 in Italy, the incidence of CDI 
was 2.3 per 10,000 patient-days [Ref. 5.4: 046KRK]. In Australia, the incidence of CDI in 
2012 was 4.03 per 10,000 patient-days [Ref. 5.4: 046MSW]. Outbreaks and other reports of 
CDI have been reported in numerous countries including Austria [Ref. 5.4: 0479VL], 
Belgium [Ref. 5.4: 0479V3], Chile [Ref. 5.4: 046Q9R], Denmark [Ref. 5.4: 047BJQ], 
Germany [Ref. 5.4: 03RPZB], Japan [Ref. 5.4: 046VLV], Korea [Ref. 5.4: 03R3RM], 
Norway [Ref. 5.4: 03RPZB] and Turkey [Ref. 5.4: 046MYJ].  
During the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in infection prevention and control practices, 
health-seeking behaviors, and antibiotic prescribing practices may have affected CDI 
incidence. Incidence of CDI during the first wave of the pandemic was lower than incidence 
during the same time period in the 1-2 years preceding the pandemic in Spain 
[Ref. 5.4: 0872S0] and Ireland [Ref. 5.4: 0872S7] and stable in the US [Ref. 5.4: 0872RY]. 
In an analysis that accounted for a longer period of follow-up (through June 2021), both 
hospital- and community-acquired CDI incidence increased in Canada [Ref. 5.4: 086K50].
 
 
Incidence of Recurrent CDI:
In the United States, the estimated annual incidence of recurrent community-associated CDI 
was 7.0 per 100,000 persons in the total population with a corresponding estimated 21,600 
cases of recurrent community-associated CDI. The estimated annual incidence of recurrent 
healthcare-associated CDI in the U.S. was 19.9 per 100,000 persons with an estimated 61,400 
cases annually [Ref. 5.4: 046PJM]. Estimates of community-associated CDI and healthcare-
associated CDI recurrence were higher for patients 65 years and older. In hospital-based 
surveillance in 14 countries in Europe, estimated incidence of recurrent healthcare-associated 
CDI was 5.9 per 100,000 patient-days [Ref. 5.4: 0872S5]. A study conducted in France 
reported that among the 14,739 survivors of the index CDI hospital stay, 2135 (14.5%) 
required at least one readmission with rCDI within 12 weeks following discharge (mean 
interval between discharge and readmission, 18 ± 20 days). More than 80% of readmission 
with rCDI occurred within 8 weeks [Ref. 5.4: 05KPBC]. 
Prevalence of CDI:
In the United States, an estimated 453,000 cases occur each year, and approximately 83,000 
recurrences and 29,300 deaths are associated with C. difficile annually. A total of 12,275 
cases of Clostridium difficile infection were reported by NHS trusts in England between 1 
April 2018 and 31 March 2019 [Ref. 5.4: 05KCK0]. The economic burden of C. difficile
infection (CDI) is estimated to be $4.8 billion in excess medical costs [Ref. 5.4: 05KC52].
CDI also occurs outside of health care settings, but community-associated disease is not 
routinely reported on a national level and incidence rates are often not well established.  
Prevalence of recurrent CDI:
One of the greatest challenges in managing CDI is preventing the recurrence of CDI.  
Between 15-35% of patients with CDI who are successfully treated for CDI with the most 
commonly prescribed antibiotics, oral metronidazole and oral vancomycin, experience a 
recurrence of CDI [Ref. 5.4: 046Q9T, 046PJM, 046JFB]. Of those who have a first 
recurrence of CDI, 40% will have another recurrence of CDI and after 2 recurrences, 60% or 
more will have another recurrence of CDI [Ref. 5.4: 046Q9T, 046JFB].  The majority of 
these recurrences occur within 60 days of successful treatment [Ref. 5.4: 046Q9T, 046JFB].
Oral fidaxomicin is also indicated for the treatment of CDI; in fidaxomicin clinical trials, the 
CDI recurrence rate has been observed to be lower among patients treated with fidaxomicin 
than patients treated with vancomycin (14% vs. 26%) [Ref. 5.4: 03RHFQ].
Of the total 453,000 estimated annual U.S. CDI cases, 18% (83,000) were recurrent cases 
[Ref. 5.4: 046PJM]. European studies report estimates of recurrence that are consistent with 
the U.S. data; Bauer et al reported the recurrence rate in Europe was 18% 
[Ref. 5.4: 03RPZB]. Dependent upon the underlying population and the definition of 
recurrence, other European studies yield recurrence results within the 10-35% range 
[Ref. 5.4: 0872S5, 03RPZC, 046QCS, 047BJQ, 046SG3, 046K80, 03QXMP, 046KRB].
 
 
Recurrent CDI is more difficult to treat and is associated with more hospitalizations, severe 
outcomes, and higher costs than initial CDI episodes. Patients with recurrent CDI were more 
likely than their counterparts who did not have a recurrence to have at least one more 
hospitalization and have more hospital days in the 180 days after discharge or treatment for 
the index CDI episode [Ref. 5.4: 047T4D]. In a U.S. hospital-based study, among patients 
with CDI, those with recurrent CDI had 33% higher hazard of death after 180 days of 
discharge or treatment for index CDI episode compared with patients without recurrent CDI 
when adjusting for patient demographics, comorbidities, and medications received during 
their index CDI hospitalization [Ref. 5.4: 048Q4Q]. In a publication from the CDC, 83% of 
CDI deaths were inpatients 65 years and older and 9% of CDI cases in those 65 years and 
older resulted in death [Ref. 5.4: 046PJM]. 
Demographics of the population in the authorized indication:
The target population is adults with an acute episode of primary or recurrent CDI and who 
are at high risk for recurrence of CDI.
Risk factors for CDI:
C. difficile spores can persist outside the human body on hard surfaces for up to five months 
[Ref. 5.4: 049C2D] and may be found on commonplace items in the healthcare environment 
such as bed linens, bed rails, floors, bathroom fixtures, and medical equipment 
[Ref. 5.4: 03YFJ5]. C. difficile contamination has been found on 49% of sites in hospital 
rooms occupied by patients with CDI and on 29% of sites sampled in rooms occupied by 
asymptomatic C. difficile carriers [Ref. 5.4: 049C2D].  CDI can spread from person-to-
person on contaminated equipment and on the hands of healthcare providers and visitors 
[Ref. 5.4: 047BJV]. The median incubation period for CDI after acquisition of C. difficile
spores is approximately 3 days [Ref. 5.4: 046PJN, 046JJ7]. Because of the hardiness of the 
C. difficile spores and their ability to persist in and around hospital equipment, hospitalized 
patients are at an increased likelihood of being exposed to C. difficile spores that can then 
infect them.
Host related risk factors for CDI include advanced age (>65 years), exposure to antibiotics 
(particularly clindamycin, cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones), especially prolonged 
exposure and exposure to more than one antibiotic, a weakened immune system, 
comorbidities such as IBD or colorectal cancer, kidney disease, use of PPIs which reduce 
stomach acid, and surgery of the GI tract.  Another critical host related risk factor is previous 
C. difficile infection [Ref. 5.4: 0479VN, 047BJV, 046KS0, 046PJK, 03RNPX, 046PJM]. 
Although gender has not been specifically identified as a risk factor for CDI, Lessa et al, 
reported that community-acquired CDI was more common in women than men after 
adjustment for age and other potential confounders (incidence per 100,000 among women 
61.0 (51.2, 70.8) vs. men 42.5 (34.8, 49.8)) [Ref. 5.4: 046PJM].
 
 
Risk Factors for CDI Recurrence:
Several studies have examined the risk factors for recurrent CDI [Ref. 5.4: 046Q9T, 
046KQN, 0408NJ, 0408NH, 03QYCM, 046JFB, 0408NK, 03RT8S]. The main conditions 
for recurrence include an inadequate antitoxin antibody response and persistent disruption of 
the colonic flora due to antibiotics received before or to treat the primary CDI episode.  
Mechanistically these conditions create an environment that permits C. difficile to flourish 
and cause recurrent disease.  The host-related risk factors contributing to this mechanism 
include age, with older patients at greater risk, comorbidities and compromised immune 
response.  The use of certain antibiotics before and after diagnosis of C. difficile, especially 
clindamycin, cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones, are important risk factors for CDI 
recurrence. More recently, PPIs have been identified as a risk factor for recurrent CDI 
[Ref. 5.4: 03R2CV]. The environmental risk factors for CDI include hospitalization and 
length of stay, as this increases risk of exposure to C. difficile spores that may be present in 
the hospital environment or may be transmitted from caretakers in the hospital. Recurrence is 
more common among patients with healthcare-associated CDI compared to community-
associated CDI. The organism-related risk factors associated with recurrent CDI include 
specific C. difficile strains. In the U.S., infection with Ribotype 027 (also known as BI or 
NAP1 when different typing methods are used) has been associated with an increased risk for 
recurrent CDI [Ref. 5.4: 046Q9W, 03R2CV, 046PJM].
The main existing treatment options: 
Current strategies for treating CDI include discontinuing therapy with the inciting antibiotic
agents that disrupt the gut flora and stimulate conditions that allow C. difficile to flourish,
and starting antibiotic therapy for CDI. Fidaxomicin is recommended for treatment of an 
initial episode of CDI, with vancomycin as an acceptable alternative; metronidazole is an 
alternative agent for use for non-severe cases if access to vancomycin and fidaxomicin is 
limited[Ref. 5.4: 0833J4]. Only vancomycin and fidaxomicin have regulatory approval for 
the treatment of CDI. Treatment strategies are based on treatment guidelines from medical 
associations Guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and Society 
for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) recommend treatment with fidaxomicin for 
treatment of a recurrence of CDI; a standard course or a pulsed and tapered regimen of 
vancomycin are acceptable alternatives for a first CDI recurrence. A 2013 update of the 
treatment guidance of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases
[Ref. 5.4: 04VYHP] includes the following points: except for very mild CDI that is clearly 
induced by antibiotic usage antibiotic treatment is advised;the main antibiotics that are 
recommended are metronidazole, vancomycin and fidaxomicin; fecal transplantation is 
strongly recommended for multiple recurrent CDI; in case of perforation of the colon and/or 
systemic inflammation and deteriorating clinical condition despite antibiotic therapy, total 
abdominal colectomy or diverting loop ileostomy combined with colonic lavage is 
recommended. However, a recent narrative review [Ref. 5.4: 055SPF] states that: Oral 
vancomycin will become the first choice when antibiotic treatment for CDI is necessary; 
fidaxomicin is a good alternative, especially in patients at risk of relapse; vancomycin 
combined with faecal microbiota transplantation remains the primary therapy for multiple 
recurrent CDI.
 
 
Various approaches to the treatment and prevention of further CDI recurrence include repeat 
courses of vancomycin or fidaxomicin, vancomycin in tapered and pulsed doses, vancomycin 
followed by rifaximin, IV immunoglobulin, and therapy with other microorganisms including 
fecal microbiota for transplantation (also referred to as fecal bacteriotherapy or FMT) 
[Ref. 5.4: 05KC4L, 03QVFH, 0872S2]. 
ZINPLAVA is an effective and well-tolerated adjunctive treatment that is indicated for 
prevention of recurrent CDI when given during a course of antibiotic therapy. A recent real-
world multicenter study demonstrated successful prevention of rCDI with bezlotoxumab, 
with observed recurrence rates that were comparable to Phase 3 clinical trial results 
[Ref. 5.4: 05HF3B]. Multiple prior CDI recurrences were associated with a higher risk of 
subsequent rCDI, supporting the use of bezlotoxumab earlier in the disease course. 
Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated population, including 
mortality and morbidity:
The severity of CDI ranges from colonization with C. difficile to severe diarrhea and 
dehydration, kidney failure, toxic megacolon, and death. More severe cases of CDI result in 
increased length of hospitalization and health care resource utilization. While the severity of 
CDI may be confounded by overall health status or other factors, the mortality rate 
attributable to CDI ranges between 5 and 10% [Ref. 5.4: 03QVFJ, 03RPWZ, 03RT92, 
046KRT].  In a report from the CDC, the mortality rate associated with CDI was 
approximately 6%.  The death rate was higher in hospital or healthcare-acquired CDI 
compared to community-acquired CDI (8.9 vs. 0.7 per 100,000) and the death rate 
significantly increased with age [Ref. 5.4: 046PJM].  Patients with recurrent CDI, compared 
to those with primary CDI, are at greater risk for death and subsequent hospitalization 
[Ref. 5.4: 048Q4Q, 047T4D].
Important co-morbidities:
Patients with CDI can have multiple comorbidities that make them susceptible to the disease 
via exposure to the C. difficile spores, disruption of gut microbiome and reduced immune 
response to CDI.  The important comorbidities in patients with C. difficile include those that 
affect the microbiome and integrity of the gut; these include infections for which wide-
spectrum antibiotics are used.  Another comorbidity of interest includes compromised 
immunity, whether by underlying disease or by exposure to medications that induces 
suppressed immunity. Examples of subjects with compromised immunity include: transplant 
patients, oncology patients or patients on chemotherapy.  All comorbidities that lead to
exposure to health care settings increase risk of exposure to C. difficile spores. Additional 
comorbidities include patients with infections requiring prolonged treatment with high-risk 
antibiotics such as clindamycin, cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones, renal impairment, 
hepatic impairment, inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune diseases, including 
rheumatoid arthritis and patients receiving PPIs or other gastric acid suppression treatment.
 
 
CDI epidemiology among paediatric populations
Incidence of CDI:
Incidence of CDI among paediatric patients increased in the US from 1991 to 2009, rising 
from 2.6 to 32.6 infections per 100,000 person-years [Ref. 5.4: 03RT8T]. In the US hospital 
setting specifically, incidence increased from 4.4 per 10,000 patient-days in 2001 to 6.5 per 
10,000 patient-days in 2006 [Ref. 5.4: 03QVDL], with a similar incidence rate in 2013 (7.1 
cases per 10,000 patient-days) as in 2006 [Ref. 5.4: 086K5J]. CDI incidence among 
paediatric inpatients in the Netherlands was also stable over approximately the same time 
period of 2009-2015 [Ref. 5.4: 04MPF8]. Incidence among paediatric inpatients in the US 
declined to 4.9 cases per 10,000 patient-days by 2019 [Ref. 5.4: 086K5J]. 
Prevalence of CDI and CDI recurrence:
In the US, there are approximately 16,900 paediatric CDI cases annually [Ref. 5.4: 046PJM].
Approximately 10-30% of paediatric patients with a case of CDI are expected to have a 
recurrent episode [Ref. 5.4: 03RT8T, 080ZG4, 082XYP, 046PJM, 05CYZL]. Among all 
paediatric CDI cases, approximately three-quarters are community-acquired, while the 
remainder are acquired in a healthcare setting [Ref. 5.4: 03RT8T, 046PJM]. Globally, 
asymptomatic colonization of C. difficile is common among infants, occurring in 41% of 
those aged 6 months to 1 year, compared with 12% in those aged 5-18 years 
[Ref. 5.4: 0826SG]. Despite relatively high prevalence of C. difficile colonization, clinically 
relevant CDI is rare in infants aged <1 year.
Severe outcomes of CDI are uncommon among paediatric cases and include toxic megacolon 
(0.1%), colectomy (0.3%), gastrointestinal perforation (0.4%) [Ref. 5.4: 086K5J], and 
pseudomembranous colitis (1.1%) [Ref. 5.4: 086KD4]. Global estimates of all-cause 
mortality among paediatric patients with CDI range from 2-5% [Ref. 5.4: 086KD4, 086K5J, 
03QVDL].
Risk factors for CDI and CDI recurrence:
Paediatric patients are at higher risk of CDI if they have prior antibiotic exposure, prolonged 
hospitalization, a history of hospitalization, current use of gastric acid suppressants, or have 
comorbidities, including neoplastic disease, immunodeficiency, solid organ transplantation, 
and enteral feeding [Ref. 5.4: 086K55]. Among paediatric patients with CDI, 67%-91% are 
estimated to have comorbidities [Ref. 5.4: 086KD4, 086K5J, 03QVDL, 080ZG4].
Risk factors for CDI recurrence include malignancy, tracheostomy tube dependence, recent 
surgery, and antibiotic use in the 30 days before symptom onset [Ref. 5.4: 082XYM, 
058630]. As with initial cases of CDI, comorbidities are common among paediatric patients 
with recurrent CDI. Among paediatric patients with recurrent CDI in a Swedish hospital, 
97% had an underlying comorbidity [Ref. 5.4: 080ZG4].
 
 
Demographics of the population in the authorized indication:
The target population is paediatric patients 1 year of age and older with an acute episode of 
primary or recurrent CDI and who are at high risk for recurrence of CDI.
Main existing treatment options:
Vancomycin and metronidazole are commonly used for treatment of paediatric CDI. Limited 
observational data suggest that vancomycin may result in higher rates of clinical 
improvement than metronidazole and that recurrence is more likely following metronidazole 
than vancomycin treatment [Ref. 5.4: 080Z6N]. Fidaxomicin is an oral, narrow-spectrum 
antibiotic that has activity against both C. difficile and its spores, thereby treating both initial 
episodes of CDI and reducing recurrence [Ref. 5.4: 080Z6N]. In a randomized controlled 
clinical trial among paediatric patients aged <18 years with CDI, fidaxomicin was non-
inferior to vancomycin for treatment of CDI and also resulted in higher rates of global cure 
(68% vs. 50%) and longer time to recurrence [Ref. 5.4: 086KDH].
 
 
PART II: MODULE SII - NON-CLINICAL PART OF THE SAFETY 
SPECIFICATION
Phase 3 clinical studies were conducted with both bezlotoxumab (a fully human mAb to C.
difficile toxin B) and actoxumab (a fully human mAb to C. difficile toxin A), alone and in 
combination.  However, these studies indicated that the combination of bezlotoxumab and 
actoxumab did not have a meaningful efficacy benefit over bezlotoxumab alone.  Therefore, 
the final product selected for registration was bezlotoxumab (see Sec SIII.1).  As the 
nonclinical toxicology program was intended to support all clinical studies, both 
bezlotoxumab and actoxumab, alone and in combination, were studied.  
The nonclinical toxicology program was designed in accordance with current regulatory 
guidelines for biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals (ICH Topic S6(R1)).  The guideline 
indicates that if there are no relevant species in which to study mAbs directed against 
exogenous targets (i.e., bacterial toxins) such as bezlotoxumab and actoxumab, the 
toxicology evaluation may be limited to a repeated dose toxicity study of ≤14 days duration 
in a single species.  No additional toxicity studies, including reproductive toxicity studies, are 
appropriate.  Based on this guidance, the nonclinical toxicology program for bezlotoxumab 
and actoxumab was limited to (1) an exploratory single-dose toxicokinetic study, (2) Good 
Laboratory Practices (GLP) -compliant repeat-dose toxicity studies in which mice were 
exposed to bezlotoxumab and actoxumab, alone and in combination over a period of 
approximately 2 weeks, and (3) in vitro tissue cross-reactivity studies.  Safety pharmacology, 
genetic, chronic, and reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity studies are not generally 
required for mAbs directed at foreign targets and were therefore not conducted. No findings 
of toxicological significance were observed in in vivo repeat-dose toxicity studies in mice at 
doses up to 125 mg/kg/dose (the maximum feasible dose) or in vitro tissue cross-reactivity 
studies.  
The acceptable safety profile of bezlotoxumab alone and in combination with actoxumab 
defined in nonclinical studies has been confirmed in clinical trials in adult and paediatric
patients. Therefore, additional nonclinical toxicity studies for the express purpose of 
evaluating effects in juvenile animals were not considered of value for establishing safety in 
the paediatric population and in accordance with ICH M3(R2) and ICH S11 
recommendations, no studies in juvenile animals were conducted.
Bezlotoxumab is not anticipated to impact the PK of concomitantly administered 
medications, as it is a highly specific mAb that targets a non-endogenous antigen (C. difficile
toxin B). No effect on inflammatory mediated changes of metabolic enzymes is expected, 
since bezlotoxumab does not react with an endogenous target; thus, no drug-drug interaction 
studies in the disease state were performed.

recurrence in adult and paediatric patients 1 year of age and older.
 
 
PART II: MODULE SIII - CLINICAL TRIAL EXPOSURE
SIII.1 Brief Overview of Development
Phase 3 clinical trials in adults were conducted with both bezlotoxumab (a fully human mAb 
to C. difficile toxin B) and actoxumab (a fully human mAb to C. difficile toxin A), alone and 
in combination.  These trials indicated that the combination of bezlotoxumab and actoxumab 
did not have a meaningful efficacy benefit over bezlotoxumab alone. In addition, actoxumab 
alone failed to show efficacy. Therefore, the final product selected for registration was 
bezlotoxumab. Safety data from participants who received actoxumab alone are not 
discussed in this document.  For completeness, all trials in the clinical development program 
are listed in Table SIII.1.
The pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials in adults (Protocol 001 (P001) and Protocol 002 (P002)) 
have demonstrated that in participants with CDI and receiving SoC antibiotic therapy for 
CDI, IV administration of a single 10 mg/kg dose of bezlotoxumab is superior to placebo in 
preventing CDI recurrence over a period of 12 weeks, and that bezlotoxumab is well-
tolerated and has a safety profile similar to placebo.  Given these findings, bezlotoxumab has 
a favorable benefit/risk profile.
The paediatric clinical development program included a single Phase 3 clinical trial 
(MK-6072-001). The rationale for the paediatric clinical trial was to obtain PK and safety 
information to support the selection of a dose for paediatric patients over 1 year of age that 
would achieve bezlotoxumab exposures similar to those obtained in adults at the 
recommended dose (as a single IV infusion at 10 mg/kg). Safety and PK data of a single IV 
infusion of bezlotoxumab (10 mg/kg) in paediatric participants were consistent with data in 
adults. Given these findings, bezlotoxumab (10 mg/kg) has a favorable benefit/risk profile in 
paediatric patients over 1 year of age. 
The overall clinical development program was comprehensive and included evaluation of 
bezlotoxumab (MK-6072), actoxumab (MK-3415), and the combination of actoxumab and 
bezlotoxumab (hereafter referred to as actoxumab + bezlotoxumab, also known as 
MK-3415A) in both healthy participants and in participants receiving a 10- to 14-day course 
of oral SoC antibiotic for CDI (metronidazole, vancomycin or fidaxomicin) for a primary or 
recurrent episode CDI. The clinical development program consisted of 9 clinical trials:  five 
(5) Phase 1 trials; two (2) Phase 2 trials; two (2) pivotal Phase 3 trials; and one (1) Phase 3 
paediatric trial (Table SIII.1)

The Phase 3 trial design and efficacy data are summarized below: 
MK-3415A P001 was an adaptive-design Phase 3 trial in which adult subjects with 
confirmed CDI and receiving SoC antibiotic treatment for CDI (metronidazole, vancomycin, 
or fidaxomicin) were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio into 1 of 4 treatment groups 
(bezlotoxumab, actoxumab, actoxumab + bezlotoxumab, or placebo).  At the pre-specified 
interim analysis, enrollment into the actoxumab arm was stopped, a decision driven by both 
low efficacy and observed increase in the number of deaths and SAEs relative to placebo. At 
the final analysis, a total of 1,396 subjects with confirmed CDI were randomized, received 
study medication and were included in efficacy analyses: 386 in bezlotoxumab, 232 in 
actoxumab, 383 in actoxumab + bezlotoxumab, and 395 in placebo groups.  P001 met the 
primary efficacy objective demonstrating that treatment with bezlotoxumab significantly 
decreases the proportion of subjects with CDI recurrence over 12 weeks as compared to 
treatment with placebo (one-sided p=0.0003). CDI recurrence rates were 17.4% in the 
bezlotoxumab group and 27.6% in the placebo group [-10.1 (95% CI: -15.9, -4.3)]. For 
actoxumab + bezlotoxumab group, the CDI recurrence rate was 15.9% and was significantly 
(one sided p<0.0001) better than placebo but was not significantly better than bezlotoxumab 
(p=0.2997).  Hence, the addition of actoxumab to therapy (i.e., actoxumab + bezlotoxumab) 
did not have efficacy benefit over bezlotoxumab. The reduction in CDI recurrence rate for 
the bezlotoxumab group versus placebo was also observed in pre-specified subgroups of 
subjects at high risk for recurrence and/or CDI-related adverse outcomes (i.e., patients ≥65 
years of age, patients with a history of CDI in past 6 months before the baseline episode, 
patients with clinically severe CDI, patients infected with the 027 ribotype or epidemic 
strain, or patients with compromised immunity).
MK-3415A P002 was identical to P001 in design and conduct, with the following 3 major 
exceptions: (1) P002 contained 3 treatment groups (bezlotoxumab, actoxumab + 
bezlotoxumab, and placebo), (2) was a traditional clinical trial of fixed design, and (3) had an 
extended 9 month follow-up of a subset of subjects (~300) to assess CDI recurrence and 
colonization with toxigenic C. difficile.  All other design features were identical between 
P001 and P002.  A total of 1,163 patients with confirmed CDI were randomized, received 
study medication and were included in efficacy analyses: 395 in bezlotoxumab, 390 in 
actoxumab + bezlotoxumab, and 378 in placebo groups. P002 also met the primary efficacy 
objective and confirmed that treatment with bezlotoxumab significantly decreases the 
proportion of subjects with CDI recurrence over a period of 12 weeks as compared to 
treatment with placebo (one-sided p=0.0003).  CDI recurrence rates were 15.7% and 25.7% 
in the bezlotoxumab and placebo groups, respectively [-9.9 (95% CI: -15.5, -4.3)].  CDI 
recurrence rate in the actoxumab + bezlotoxumab group was 14.9% and was significantly 
(one sided p<0.0001) better than placebo but was not significantly better than bezlotoxumab 
(p=0.3718).  Consistent with P001, reduction in CDI recurrence rate for the bezlotoxumab 
group versus placebo was observed in all pre-specified subgroups of subjects.
Therefore, given these findings, bezlotoxumab was the final product proposed for adult 
registration.  In support of this decision, the clinical trial exposure and safety data for 
bezlotoxumab in the Phase 3 (P001 + P002) integrated data are presented in this document.  
Overall, 786 subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of CDI received a 10 mg/kg dose of 
bezlotoxumab and 781 received placebo (0.9% NaCl.)  Clinical trial exposure and safety data 
 
 
from the actoxumab alone and the combination actoxumab + bezlotoxumab groups are not 
included in this document, as bezlotoxumab is the approved product.
In addition to the adult clinical trials, MK-6072 P001 was a Phase 3, randomized, placebo-
controlled, parallel group, multisite, double-blind study evaluating the PK, safety, 
tolerability, and efficacy of a single infusion of bezlotoxumab or placebo in paediatric
participants 1 to <18 years of age receiving antibacterial drug treatment for CDI. Participants 
were randomized 3:1 to bezlotoxumab 10 mg/kg or placebo and were stratified by age at 
randomization (Age Cohort 1: 12 to <18 years of age, Age Cohort 2: 1 to <12 years of age). 
Participants were followed up for 12 weeks (ie, 85 ± 5 days) for PK and immunogenicity 
collections, monitoring of safety and tolerability parameters, and efficacy outcomes. The 
final sample size was 143 participants (107 treated with bezlotoxumab; 36 placebo).
Although efficacy was a secondary objective, the study was not powered for the analysis of 
efficacy and an extrapolation approach incorporating the adult data was used. 
 
 
SIII.2 Clinical Trial Exposure
Adult population: Two Phase 3 trials (MK-3415A P001 + P002) have been completed in 
adult subjects with CDI who were receiving SoC antibiotic therapy for a primary or recurrent 
episode of CDI.  In the clinical trials, the age range of subjects who received bezlotoxumab 
was 18-100 years.  The protocols had broad inclusion and limited exclusion criteria, 
permitting a comprehensive evaluation of adult subjects with diverse underlying 
comorbidities, a wide range of clinical characteristics associated with a high risk for 
additional CDI episodes, and more than 130 different strains of C. difficile.
Table SIII.2.1 displays exposure by dose, in mg/kg and mg, for the 786 subjects who 
received bezlotoxumab in the integrated P001 and P002 APaT population.  Doses are 
summarized relative to the intended 10 mg/kg dose; no subjects received a dose >20 mg/kg, 
the highest single dose evaluated in Phase 1 trials.
Of the 14 subjects who received <9.5 mg/kg, one subject, discontinued the infusion before 
the full volume was administered due to an AE of ventricular tachyarrhythmia, chills, and 
dizziness.
Of the 9 subjects who received more than the intended dose (defined as ≥10.5 mg/kg), four 
subjects received the higher than intended dose due to incorrect recording of their weight; 
two were due to pharmacist error; and three due to presumed incorrect weight assessment 
(though this could not be verified).  Dose overages ranged from 0.5 to 4.8 mg/kg, except for
two subjects who received 20 mg/kg of bezlotoxumab.  Of the 9 subjects who received a 
dose ≥10.5 mg/kg, an AE with temporal association to study medication administration was 
reported for 3 subjects.

Clinical Trial Exposure in Special Populations in Adults
The eligibility criteria for the Phase 3 adult trials (MK-3415A P001 + P002) were 
unrestrictive and a diverse population was enrolled. Safety was evaluated in subgroups based 
on intrinsic factors of interest (including age, gender, and race).  An exception was that 
children (<18 years of age) and females who were pregnant and/or lactating were excluded.  
None of the females who were enrolled and exposed to bezlotoxumab alone were reported to 
have become pregnant or to have breastfed during the study follow-up period. One subject in 
P002 receiving actoxumab + bezlotoxumab became pregnant during the course of the trial.  
On Day 258, the subject had a spontaneous, live, vaginal birth of a healthy, female baby.
Clinical trial exposure to bezlotoxumab in adult special populations is summarized in Table 
SIII.2.4.  Renal impairment was defined as serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL.  Hepatic

PART II: MODULE SIV - POPULATIONS NOT STUDIED IN CLINICAL TRIALS
SIV.1
Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Studies Within the Development 
Program
The reason for excluding subpopulations from bezlotoxumab clinical trials were the 
following: 1) need to exclude subjects with an uncontrolled chronic diarrheal illness that 
could confound interpretation of safety and/or efficacy results, and 2) need to exclude special 
populations such as pregnant women.  Reasons for excluding subpopulations are summarized 
in Table SIV.1.1.
Table SIV.1.1:
Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Studies Within the 
Development Program
Exclusion Criterion
Reason for Exclusion
Is it Considered to be 
Missing Information?
Rationale (if not Included 
as Missing Information)
Pregnant, breastfeeding, or 
expecting to conceive or 
father children within the 
projected treatment duration.
Lactating women were 
excluded from the clinical 
trials. 
Plans to donate blood and/or 
blood products within 6 
months following the 
infusion
Patient is not expected to 
survive for 72 hours
Patient with a planned 
surgery for CDI within 24 
hours
Avoid potential harm to the 
unborn fetus or breastfeeding 
newborn.
Adequate and well controlled 
studies with bezlotoxumab have 
not been conducted in pregnant 
women.
There are no safety studies in 
newborns.
It is not known whether 
bezlotoxumab is secreted in 
human milk.
This exclusion criterion was due 
to GCP reasons.  Monoclonal 
antibodies, including 
bezlotoxumab, can be detected in 
serum for several months after 
infusion.  Therefore, a patient 
receiving a blood product 
donated by a subject in the 
clinical trials would likely 
receive the experimental 
antibodies without having 
consented to receive this 
experimental product. 
This exclusion criterion was
included in order to facilitate
patient completion of the trial.

Exclusion Criterion
Reason for Exclusion
Is it Considered to be 
Missing Information?
Rationale (if not Included 
as Missing Information)
No
This is not a safety concern 
for bezlotoxumab.
These subjects were excluded 
because ulcerative colitis and 
Crohn’s disease are alternative 
causes of diarrhea.  Therefore, 
the presence of diarrhea due to 
these chronic conditions in a 
patient who is colonized with C. 
difficile would have confounded 
evaluation of the efficacy of 
bezlotoxumab. 
Patient with an uncontrolled
chronic diarrheal illness
such as, but not limited to, 
uncontrolled ulcerative
colitis or Crohn's disease or
with a condition such that
their normal 24–hour bowel
movement habit is 3 or more
loose stools as defined by 
the Bristol Stool Chart 
Types 5, 6, and/or 7. 
Patients with a history of 
inflammatory bowel
disease who are controlled
(i.e, had no recent active
diarrhea prior to current C.
difficile episode) may be
enrolled if in the opinion of
the investigator the 
symptoms are more likely 
due to CDI than a f lare of 
the inflammatory bowel 
disease.
Patient has previously
participated in this trial, has
previously received MK-
3415 (actoxumab) or MK-
6072 (bezlotoxumab), either
alone or in combination, has
received a C. difficile 
vaccine, or has received any
other experimental
monoclonal antibody
against C. difficile toxin A
or B.
Patient has received immune
globulin within 6 months
prior to receipt of the
infusion or is planning to
receive immune globulin 
prior to the completion of 
the 12-Week study period
Patient for whom treatment
with SoC is planned for
longer than 14 days (e.g., 
planned tapered or pulsed 
regimen of vancomycin).
No
No
No
This exclusion criterion was 
included in order to avoid prior 
medications that may confound 
the efficacy assessments since 
these therapies may decrease the 
incidence of CDI recurrence. 
Also, efficacy and safety of 
experimental antibodies and 
vaccines has not been 
established.
This exclusion criterion was 
included in order to avoid 
concomitant medications that 
may confound the efficacy 
assessments since these therapies 
have been shown to decrease the 
incidence of CDI recurrence.
This exclusion criterion was 
included because the definition 
of clinical cure required no more 
than a 14-day regimen of SoC 
antibiotics.  Therefore, subjects 
receiving tapered or pulsed 
regimens for treatment of CDI 
(which are traditionally longer 
than 14 days) would have 
automatically been considered a 
failure for this endpoint.
There is no evidence to
suggest a safety concern for 
subjects concurrently using
these agents with 
bezlotoxumab.

cholestyramine,
cholestimide, rifaximin, or 
nitazoxanide within 14 days
prior to receipt of the
infusion or is planning to
receive these medications 
prior to the completion of

Patient plans to take
medications which are
given to decrease 
gastrointestinal peristalsis, 
such as loperamide 
(Imodium™) or 
diphenoxylate 
hydrochloride/atropine 
sulfate (Lomotil™) at any 
time during the 14 days
following infusion.  Patients 
receiving opioid medications
at the onset of diarrhea may 
be included if they are 
expected to be on stable
doses of these medications
or there is anticipation of a 
dose decrease or cessation of 
their use.
Patient plans to take the 
probiotic Saccharomyces 
boulardii or receive FMT, or
any other therapies that 
have been demonstrated to 
decrease CDI recurrences at
any time following infusion
(Day 1) and through the
completion of the 12-Week
study period.
Patient has any other
condition that, in the 
opinion of the investigator, 
would jeopardize the safety 
or rights of the patient
participating in the trial,
would make it unlikely for
the patient to complete the
trial, or would confound the
results of the trial.
 
 
SIV.2
Limitations to Detect Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trial Development 
Program
The clinical development program is unlikely to detect certain types of adverse reactions 
such as rare adverse reactions, adverse reactions with a long latency, or those caused by
prolonged or cumulative exposure. The limitations of the clinical trial program are 
summarized in Table SIV.2.1.
Table SIV.2.1:
Limitations of Clinical Trial Program
Ability to Detect Adverse 
Reactions
Which are rare 
Due to prolonged exposure
Due to cumulative effects
Which have a long latency
Discussion of Implications for Target 
Population
Using the “Rule of 3”, ADRs with a 
frequency >1/262 could be detected if 
there were no background incidence. 
ADRs with a rare or very rare frequency 
might not be detected.
There are limited data on factors in adult 
patients that may affect the half-life of 
mAbs.  While some subjects treated with 
bezlotoxumab were followed for an 
extended period, the number of these 
subjects was limited.
P004 demonstrated that administration of 
2 doses of actoxumab + bezlotoxumab 12 
weeks apart is generally well-tolerated, 
and no treatment-emergent ADA were 
detected during the 24 weeks follow-up 
after the 2nd dose.  Phase 3 trials were 
conducted with a single dose 
administration, i.e., the intended dose.  
ADRs with a long latency might not be 
detected in the clinical dataset.
Limitation of Trial Program
The safety profile is based on data from 
786 adult subjects with CDI treated 
with bezlotoxumab in Phase 3 trials.
The half-life of bezlotoxumab is 
approximately 19 days. Adult subjects
in Phase 3 were followed for AEs for 
12 weeks (~4.5 half-lives). There were 
a total of 295 subjects who completed 
the main study and subsequently 
entered the extension phase of the study
with 100 bezlotoxumab-treated and 83 
placebo-treated subjects monitored for 
a total of 9 months.
Phase 3 trials were conducted with a 
single dose administration. Data on 
cumulative effects (repeated 
administration) are limited to a Phase 1 
trial in which two doses were 
administered separated by 12 weeks 
(P004).  No data are available on 
repeated administration after a shorter 
interval, and no data are available in
adult patients.
Nonserious adverse events were 
reported for 28 days following study 
medication.  Serious adverse events and 
deaths were reported for all adult 
subjects in the Phase 3 studies through 
85±5 days after infusion with study 
medication.  A limitation is that only a 
subset of subjects was monitored longer 
than 85 days.  Long term follow-up was 
limited to 100 subjects who were 
monitored for SAEs related to study 
medication and SAEs with a fatal 
outcome through 12 months post-
infusion.

In Phase 3 trial (MK-6072 P001), 107 paediatric patients 1 
year of age and older were exposed to one dose of 
bezlotoxumab.  
A substantial number of elderly subjects (65 years of age and 
older) were enrolled in the Phase 3 trials, as is expected for 
subjects with CDI.

In the Phase 3 Studies (MK-3415A PN001 + PN002), 49 
patients with hepatic impairment (defined by having two 
or more of the following at baseline: (a) albumin ≤3.1 
g/dL, (b) ALT ≥2X ULN, (c) total bilirubin ≥1.3X ULN, 
or (d) mild, moderate or severe liver disease (as reported 
on the Charlson Comorbidity Index)) were exposed to 
one dose of bezlotoxumab.


In the Phase 3 Studies (MK-3415A PN001 + PN002), 
126 patients with renal impairment (defined as serum 
creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL) were exposed to one dose of 
bezlotoxumab.
In the Phase 3 Studies (MK-3415A PN001 + PN002), 
604 patients with a history of a cardiovascular 
impairment (defined as conditions under the cardiac 
disorders system order class (MedDRA version 17.1)) 
were exposed to one dose of bezlotoxumab.
In the Phase 3 Studies (MK-3415A PN001 + PN002), 
341 immunocompromised patients (defined as an active 
hematological malignancy, an active malignancy 
requiring recent cytotoxic chemotherapy, prior 
hematopoietic stem cell transplant, prior solid organ 
transplant, asplenia, or neutropenia/pancytopenia due to 
other conditions) were exposed to one dose of 
bezlotoxumab.
The clinical development program included subjects with 
CDI of any severity; therefore, there were no patients 
with disease severity different from inclusion criteria
In the Phase 3 Studies (MK-3415A PN001 + PN002), 786 
patients, which included 5 American Indian or Alaska Native, 
68 Asian, 46 Black of African American, 15 multiple 
ethnicities and 652 White, were exposed to one dose of 
bezlotoxumab.
Not included in the clinical development program.

Post-Authorisation Exposure
SV.1.1
Method Used to Calculate Exposure
Patient exposure estimates from product market introduction (international birth date: 
21-OCT-2016) to 31-MAY-2022 were calculated from our Company’s internal product 
distribution data from Worldwide Financial Reporting System (WFRS) and the Financial 
Sharing Area (FSA) databases. 
A summary of the worldwide distribution of bezlotoxumab from product launch to
31-MAY-2022 presented in Table S V.1.2.1 based on the available data. Given 
bezlotoxumab is available as a single-use, 1000 mg vial, the assumption was made that each 
vial distributed represents 1 patient treated. The 625 mg vial is approved and marketed only 
in Japan, therefore the post marketing exposure data is represented separately in Table S 
V.1.2.1.
SV.1.2
Exposure
The estimated number of doses of bezlotoxumab distributed worldwide from product launch 
through 31-MAY-2022 is 20,506. This corresponds to 20,506 estimated patients treated.

Important Identified Risks that are being reclassified
There are no Important Identified Risks for bezlotoxumab.
Important Potential Risks that are being reclassified
Based upon EMA GVP Module V (Rev 2) guidance, ‘Immunogenicity’ previously classified 
as an important potential risk, is removed from the list of RMP risks. This risk was 
maintained as the study MK-6072 001 was considered an additional pharmacovigilance 
activity for bezlotoxumab. As study MK-6072 001 is now completed, no new safety concerns 
were identified, no additional pharmacovigilance activities are planned to further characterize 
it, and immunogenicity following administration of bezlotoxumab is described in the label, 
this risk was removed from the list of Important Potential Risks. Routine risk minimization 
measures remain adequate for maintaining the positive benefit risk profile for the product use 
in the targeted indications. 
Revision and Reclassification of concerns identified as Missing Information
Exposure in paediatric patients, previously identified as missing information, is removed 
from the list of safety concerns. The paediatric clinical trial MK-6072-001 (MK-6072 P001)
demonstrated that the safety profile in paediatric participants is consistent with that observed
in adults. No new safety concern was identified.

PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN BY PRODUCT
Summary of risk management plan for bezlotoxumab
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for bezlotoxumab. The RMP details 
important risks of bezlotoxumab, how these risks can be minimised, and how more 
information will be obtained about bezlotoxumab's risks and uncertainties (missing 
information).
Bezlotoxumab's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how bezlotoxumab should 
be used. 
This summary of the RMP for bezlotoxumab should be read in the context of all this 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
bezlotoxumab's RMP.
I.
The Medicine and What It Is Used For
Bezlotoxumab is authorised for the prevention of recurrence of Clostridioides difficile 
infection (CDI) in adult and paediatric patients 1 year of age and older at high risk for 
recurrence of CDI (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains bezlotoxumab as the active 
substance and it is given as a single intravenous infusion of 10 mg/kg.
Further information about the evaluation of bezlotoxumab’s benefits can be found in 
bezlotoxumab’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA 
website, under the medicine’s webpage:  
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/zinplava
II.
Risks Associated With the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further 
Characterise the Risks 
Important risks of bezlotoxumab, together with measures to minimise such risks and the
proposed studies for learning more about bezotoxumab's risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
• Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;
• Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
 
 
• The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly;
• The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of bezlotoxumab is not yet available, it 
is listed under ‘missing information’ below.
II.A
List of Important Risks and Missing Information
Important risks of bezlotoxumab are risks that need special risk management activities to 
further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely 
administered. Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are 
concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of bezlotoxumab. Potential 
risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on 
available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. 
Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is 
currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

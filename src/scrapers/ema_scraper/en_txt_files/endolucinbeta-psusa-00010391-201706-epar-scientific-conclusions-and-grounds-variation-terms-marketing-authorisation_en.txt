Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSURs for lutetium (177Lu) chloride, the 
scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
The interim results of the randomised controlled clinical trial NETTER-1 demonstrated evidence of a 
higher incidence of any grade of alopecia in patients receiving Lu177 peptide receptor radionuclide 
therapy. In addition to this clinical trial, a number of prospective single-arm studies reported hair loss 
occurring in more than 50% of patients with neuroendocrine tumours receiving Lu177.  
Although the identified studies have limitations, the PRAC noted the consistency with which hair loss has 
been reported. Moreover, an association with hair loss is biologically plausible. Hair loss can greatly 
impact quality of life hence the PRAC is of the view that information that it may occur but appears to be 
generally mild and temporary is valuable to patients. A product information update is therefore 
recommended.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisations 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for lutetium (177Lu) chloride the CHMP is of the opinion that 
the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal products containing lutetium (177Lu) chloride is unchanged 
subject to the proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisations should be varied.

Scientific conclusions  
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for IMVANEX, the scientific conclusions 
of PRAC are as follows:  
The PRAC considered that whilst currently, there appears to be one case of serious hypersensitivity 
reaction vaccination in clinical trials, there is a plausible temporal relationship between vaccination and 
the onset of events. Therefore the PRAC requested that this risk should be reflected in section 4.8 of 
the SmPC by including the term ‘angioedema’. The Patient Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
Therefore, in view of available data regarding Imvanex, the PRAC considered that changes to the 
product information were warranted.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for IMVANEX, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance modified vaccinia ankara virus is 
favourable subject to the proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.

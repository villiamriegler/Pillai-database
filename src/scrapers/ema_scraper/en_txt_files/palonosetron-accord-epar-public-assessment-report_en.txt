2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Palonosetron Accord 250 micrograms solution for injection is a generic medicinal product containing 
the active substance palonosetron. Palonosetron is a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist with a strong binding 
affinity for this receptor and little or no affinity for other receptors. Palonosetron is an antiemetic 
agent. It is presented as a white to off white crystalline powder. It is freely soluble in water and soluble 
in methanol. Chemically it is (3aS)-2-[(3S)-1-Azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-yl]-2,3,3a,4,5,6- hexahydro-1H-
benz[de]isoquinolin-1-one hydrochloride. 
The reference medicinal product is Aloxi, palonosetron hydrochloride, 250 micrograms solution for 
injection of Helsinn Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd, Ireland, authorised on 22/03/2005 via centralised 
procedure (authorisation number: EU/1/04/306). Therefore, according to the legislation, the applicant 
is not required to provide the results of pre-clinical tests and clinical trials as the medicinal product is a 
generic of a reference product, which has been authorised in the Community for at least 10 years. 
The applicant is applying for a marketing authorisation for Palonosetron Accord, which has the same 
qualitative and quantitative composition in terms of the active pharmaceutical ingredient and also is of 
the same pharmaceutical form as the reference product. 
The safety and efficacy profile of palonosetron for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting 
associated with emetogenic chemotherapy has been demonstrated in several clinical trials for the 
reference medicinal product. In addition, there is a long-term post-marketing experience contributing 
to the knowledge of the clinical use of this active substance. 
The indications for Palonosetron Accord are identical to the indications of Aloxi and are as follows: 
Palonosetron Accord is indicated in adults for: 
 
the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer 
chemotherapy, 
 
the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with moderately emetogenic cancer 
chemotherapy. 
Palonosetron Accord is indicated in paediatric patients 1 month of age and older for. 
 
the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer 
chemotherapy and prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with moderately emetogenic 
cancer chemotherapy. 
Palonosetron Accord should be used only before chemotherapy administration. This medicinal product 
should be administered by a healthcare professional under appropriate medical supervision. 
The posology is 250 micrograms of palonosetron administered as a single intravenous bolus 
approximately 30 minutes before the start of chemotherapy. Palonosetron Accord should be injected 
over 30 seconds. 
The efficacy of Palonosetron Accord in the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by highly 
emetogenic chemotherapy may be enhanced by the addition of a corticosteroid administered prior to 
chemotherapy.

The product is available in a 6 ml type I tubular clear glass vial, closed with chlorobutyl rubber stopper 
and sealed with a flip-off aluminium seal. It is available in a pack of 1 vial containing 5 ml of solution. 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
The information on palonosetron hydrochloride was provided according to the Active Substance Master 
File (ASMF) procedure. 
The chemical name of palonosetron hydrochloride is (3aS)-2-[(3S)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-yl]-
2,3,3a,4,5,6-hexahydro-1H-benz[de]-isoquinolin-1-one hydrochloride corresponding to the molecular 
formula C19H24N2O·HCl and has a relative molecular mass of 332.87 g/mol. It has the following 
structure: 
The  structure  of  the  active  substance  was  elucidated  by  1H  NMR  spectroscopy,  mass  spectroscopy, 
infrared spectroscopy and elemental analysis.  
Palonosetron hydrochloride is white to off-white, non-hygroscopic, crystalline powder, freely soluble in 
water and soluble in methanol. It has two chiral centres whereas the active substance in the product 
consists of a single stereoisomer. The absolute configuration of the active substance is (3aS,3S). 
Palonosetron hydrochloride is known to exhibit polymorphism. The manufacturing process, employed 
by the ASMF holder consistently yields Form I. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process control 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted 
part of the ASMF and was considered satisfactory.  
Palonosetron hydrochloride is synthesized in 5 stages using 2 starting materials with acceptable 
specifications.

provided with regard to their origin, specifications and evaluation of impurities.  
Assessment report  
EMA/287566/2016  
Page 7/18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products and reagents have been presented and are satisfactory.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards  to their origin and characterised. No 
class  I  solvents  are  used  in  the  manufacturing  process  and  a  discussion  as  well  as  sufficient 
reassurance on absence of genotoxic impurities has been provided.  
The container closure system consisting of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bags, has been described 
and found acceptable.  
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for description, solubility (Ph. Eur. ), identification (IR, 
HPLC), pH (Ph. Eur.), loss on drying (Ph. Eur.), sulphated ash (Ph. Eur.), heavy metals (USP method), 
(3aR, 3R)-enantiomer content (HPLC), related substance (HPLC), assay (HPLC), chloride content 
(titrimetry), palladium content (ICP-OES), lithium content (ICP-OES), residual solvents (GC), bacterial 
endotoxins (Ph. Eur.) and microbial examination (Ph. Eur.).  
Additional  information  on  potential  impurities  was  requested  and  the  suitability  of  applied  limits  in 
active  substance  specifications  was  scrutinised  and  was  justified  in  an  acceptable  manner.  The 
proposed limits for metal catalysts are justified based on PDE for parenteral use as per ICH Q3D. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used has been presented. 
Batch analysis data on 3 commercial scale batches of the active substance were provided. The results 
are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on 3 commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer 
stored in the intended commercial active substance package, low-density polyethylene bag, for 36 
months under long term conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for to 6 months under accelerated 
conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
The following parameters were tested: Description, identification by IR (Initial, third and sixth month in 
accelerated and initial and further annually during long term study), loss on drying, pH, assay, related 
substances, (3aR, 3R)-enantiomer content. The analytical methods used were the same as for release 
and were stability indicating. 
All tested parameters were within the specifications. No significant changes were observed in any of 
the batches under the stability study.  
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch and no degradation 
was observed when exposed to light. Results on stress conditions (acid, base, peroxide, thermal, 
humidity) were also provided on one batch and degradation was observed with peroxide. 
Assessment report  
EMA/287566/2016  
Page 8/18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 36 months in the proposed 
container. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is a 5 ml vial of sterile aqueous, clear, colourless solution containing 250 
micrograms palonosetron (as hydrochloride).  
The  active  ingredient,  route  of  administration,  dosage  form,  and  concentration  of  palonosetron 
hydrochloride injection are similar to the reference product Aloxi 250 micrograms solution for injection 
marketed by Helsinn Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd, Ireland. All ingredients were formulated to match the 
reference product for each specific attribute. No alternative formulations were investigated. 
The development activities were aimed towards achieving a generic, stable formulation of Palonosetron 
Hydrochloride  Injection  0.05  mg/ml  (5  ml)  in  glass  vial  which  is  similar  to  that  of  the  EU  innovator 
product.  
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and are in line with innovator product Aloxi 
250 micrograms solution for injection. Their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards. The list of 
excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. The finished product does not contain any 
preservative. 
Physicochemical properties of the finished product such as description, assay and osmolality as well as 
the impurity profile are comparable with those of the innovator product. 
The pH range of the finished product is lower than the measured pH of reference product (5.07) and 
lower than the physiological range and could cause adverse reactions to the patients during 
administration. Justification for the suitability of pH range has been provided. As a further measure, 
injection site reactions as a potential risk were included to the RMP based on precautionary principles 
and the finished product is added to the EURD list due to its lower pH compared to the reference 
product.  
Terminal sterilisation was selected as manufacturing process and critical steps of manufacturing 
process were optimised. A number of studies were performed to optimise the manufacturing process of 
finished product, including a solubilisation study, a study on the selection of sterilisation method, a 
study on flushing, an excipient optimisation study, a pH extreme study, a bulk holding and surface 
compatibility study, filter compatibility studies, a freeze thaw study and performance testing.  
The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the 
intended use of the product.  
Based on information of the innovator product clear glass vials of 6 ml furnished with chlorobutyl 
rubber stoppers, for which compatibility studies have been conducted, were selected as containers for 
finished product. The material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of six main steps: preparation of bulk solution, filtration, vial filling 
& stoppering, vial sealing, terminal sterilisation and labeling & packaging.  
Assessment report  
EMA/287566/2016  
Page 9/18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. Hold time study results on 
unfiltered and filtered bulk solutions support the proposed holding times.  
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by studies on three batches of finished 
product. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished 
product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this 
type of manufacturing process.  
Finished Product Specification  
The  finished  product  release  and  shelf  life  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of 
dosage form: description, identification (HPLC), pH (Ph. Eur.) extractable volume (Ph. Eur.), particulate 
contamination (Ph. Eur.), bacterial endotoxin (Ph. Eur.), sterility (Ph. Eur.), related substance (HPLC), 
assay (HPLC), clarity and color of solution (Ph. Eur.).  
The specifications are considered adequate for individual impurities set according to ICH thresholds 
taking into account the maximum daily dose. Upon CHMP request, the total impurities limit (related 
substances) at the end of shelf life was tightened in line with batch data.  
Details on specified impurities have been provided in the ASMF.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
including their preparation and qualification has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for three exhibit batches (commercial scale) confirming the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product 
specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data of 3 exhibit batches of finished product stored under long term conditions for  up  to 36 
months  at  25 ºC  /  60%  RH  and  for  to  6  months  under  accelerated  conditions  at  40  ºC  /  75%  RH 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  The  batches of finished  product  are  representative to 
those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for description, pH (Ph.Eur.), clarity & colour of solution, assay, related 
substances, particulate contamination (sub visible), sterility and bacterial endotoxin. 
The analytical methods for stability studies are the same  as used for release testing and  are stability 
indicating.  
The  stability  study  was  performed  on  the  samples  in  the  inverted  position.  Test  results  both  at  long 
term  and  accelerated  conditions  were  in  accordance  with  the  applied  acceptance  criteria  and  no 
significant  changes  have  been  observed.  In  addition,  one  batch  was  exposed  to light  as  required by 
ICH  Guideline  on  Photostability  Testing  of  New  Drug  Substances  and  Products  and  results  were  in 
accordance with applied acceptance criteria.  
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months without special storage 
conditions as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable.

Adventitious agents 
None of the excipients is of human or animal origin. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The applicant did not submit non-clinical studies. A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which is based on up-to-date and adequate 
scientific literature. The overview provides the justification as to why there is no need to generate 
additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical aspects of 
the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been discussed 
based on the Guideline CPMP/ICH/2738/99 and was considered generally acceptable. The limit for total 
impurities has been tightened. 
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the 
introduction of Palonosetron Accord manufactured by Accord Healthcare Limited is considered unlikely 
to result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all palonosetron containing 
products and the exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the environmental risk is 
expected to be similar and not increased. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The applicant provided a justification for not conducting any toxicological and pharmacological studies 
as the indications proposed and the pharmaceutical form and strength of Palonosetron Accord are the 
same as for the reference product Aloxi.  Instead, the applicant provided a review of the literature for 
the in vitro and in vivo pharmacological and toxicological studies of palonosetron to support the claim 
Assessment report  
EMA/287566/2016  
Page 11/18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
that the generic product Palonosetron Accord is similar to the reference product Aloxi. The information 
in the SmPC section 5.3 is the same as for the reference product.  
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP is of the opinion that the applicant has justified the lack of non-clinical studies based on the 
literature review and the claim that Palonosetron Accord is a generic of the reference product Aloxi. 
The literature data presented in the dossier is considered acceptable and sufficient for the assessment 
of non-clinical aspects of Palonosetron Accord in the applied indications. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The applicant provided a clinical overview outlining the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as 
well as efficacy and safety of palonosetron hydrochloride based on published literature. The relevant 
SmPC sections are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. 
No formal scientific advice by the CHMP has been requested for this medicinal product. 
GCP 
The applicant did not submit clinical trials with this application. 
Exemption  
Palonosetron Accord has been developed as a pharmaceutical equivalent of Aloxi solution for injection, 
(Helsinn Birex Pharmaceuticals Limited, Ireland). Palonosetron Accord is essentially similar to the 
approved reference product, Aloxi. Palonosetron Accord is qualitatively and quantitatively identical in 
composition to that of Aloxi. The active ingredient, dosage form, route of administration and strength 
of Palonosetron Accord are identical to those of the reference medicinal product. Palonosetron Accord 
is presented in packs of 1 vial containing 5 mL of solution, which is the same as Aloxi. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics  
No new pharmacokinetic studies were submitted. The applicant provided a literature review of the PK 
aspects of palenosetron. 
Following palonosetron intravenous administration, an initial decline in plasma concentrations is 
followed by slow elimination from the body with a mean terminal elimination half-life of approximately 
40 hours. Mean maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve 
(AUC0-∞) are generally dose-proportional over the dose range of 0.3– 90 μg/kg in healthy subjects 
and in cancer patients.  
Palonosetron at the recommended dose is widely distributed in the body with a volume of distribution 
of approximately 6.9 to 12.5 l/kg. Approximately 62% of palonosetron is bound to plasma proteins. 
Assessment report  
EMA/287566/2016  
Page 12/18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Palonosetron is eliminated by dual route, about 40% eliminated through the kidney and with 
approximately 50% metabolised to form two primary metabolites, which have less than 1% of the 
5HT3 receptor antagonist activity of palonosetron. In vitro metabolism studies have shown that 
CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent, CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 isoenzymes are involved in the metabolism of 
palonosetron.  
Radiolabeled metabolic characterization of a single i.v. [14C]-palonosetron (10 μg/kg) reveals that 
unchanged palonosetron accounts for 71.9% of the total radioactivity in plasma over 96 h. 
Approximately 83% of the dose was recovered in urine (~40% as unchanged drug, with 50% 
metabolized; M9 [N-oxide metabolite] and M4 were the major metabolites) and 3.4% in feces. Both 
renal and hepatic routes are involved in the elimination of palonosetron from the body. The mean CLT 
for palonosetron is 160 ml/h/kg. The mean renal clearance of palonosetron is 66.5 ml/h/kg. Mean CLT 
of palonosetron ranges from 1.51 to 2.23 ml/min/kg at palonosetron doses of 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30 or 90 
μg/kg, indicating low clearance compared with hepatic blood flow (approximately 20 ml/min/kg). The 
low CLT and large Vd resulted in a long T1/2, with mean values ranging from 43.7 to 128 h. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No  new  pharmacodynamic  studies  were  presented  and  no  such  studies  are  required  for  this 
application. Post marketing experience 
2.4.1.  Post marketing experience 
No  post-marketing  data  were  submitted  by  the  applicant.  The  medicinal  product  has  not  been 
marketed in any country. 
2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
No new pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic studies were submitted. A summary of the literature 
with regard to clinical data of Palonosetron Accord and justifications that the active substance does not 
differ significantly in properties with regards to safety and efficacy of the reference product was 
provided and was accepted by the CHMP. The summary of literature referred to the proposed 
indications. 
Palonosetron Accord is to be administered as an aqueous intravenous injection and contains the same 
active ingredient in the same concentration and pharmaceutical formulation using the same route of 
administration as for the reference product. It has an identical qualitative and quantitative composition 
in terms of the active substance as its reference medicinal product and also contains the same 
excipients. As it is indicated for intravenous administration and in accordance to 
CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1, Appendix II, Parenteral solutions, bioequivalence can be concluded 
without the need for further studies. There are no differences in non-clinical or clinical effects that are 
expected. Main safety concerns identified with the reference product were severe constipation and 
severe hypersensitivity reactions. Important potential risks (as for other 5HT3 antagonists) are QT/QTc 
prolongation and serotonin syndrome. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
The CHMP is of the opinion that the applicant has justified the lack of clinical studies based on the 
claim that Palonosetron Accord is a generic of the reference product Aloxi. As the product contains the 
Assessment report

same active ingredient in the same concentration and pharmaceutical formulation using the same 
route of administration as for the reference product, the lack of bioequivalence studies is considered 
acceptable. The literature data and the publicly available information presented in the dossier are 
considered acceptable and sufficient for the assessment of clinical aspects of Palonosetron Accord in 
the applied indications. 
2.5.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the RMP version 3.0 (dated 8 February 2016) is acceptable.  
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes.

2.6.  PSUR submission 
An important potential safety concern of “injection site reactions” was raised during the assessment.  
The product Palonosetron Accord has a low pH  compared to the reference product. It is known that 
the incidence of injection site reactions (including phlebitis) is higher with a lower pH level and longer 
duration of IV administration. Hence, “injection site reaction” and close monitoring through routine 
pharmacovigilance was added to the RMP. In light of this safety concern, the applicant shall submit 
PSURs in line with the reference product PSUR submission requirements (EURD list). This need for 
PSUR submission will continue to be reassessed as further market experience is acquired.  
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  Applicant  has  submitted  a  signed  Summary  of  the  Pharmacovigilance  System.  The  CHMP 
considered that the Summary of the Pharmacovigilance  System  submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.8.  Product information 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report making reference to Aloxi. The bridging report submitted by the applicant 
has been found acceptable.

3.  Benefit-risk balance 
This application concerns a generic version of palonosetron hydrochloride, 250 microgram solution for 
injection. The reference product Aloxi is indicated in adults for the prevention of acute nausea and 
vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy and the prevention of nausea and 
vomiting associated with moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, and is indicated in paediatric 
patients 1 month of age and older for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting associated with 
highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy and prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with 
moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy. No nonclinical studies have been provided for this 
application but an adequate summary of the available nonclinical information for the active substance 
was presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain 
new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the 
active substance; the applicant’s clinical overview on these clinical aspects based on information from 
published literature was considered sufficient and acceptable. 
A bioequivalence study was not submitted and this was considered acceptable as Palonosetron Accord 
contains the same active ingredient in the same concentration and pharmaceutical formulation using 
the same route of administration (parenteral) as for the reference product. 
The CHMP, having considered the quality data provided as well as the non-clinical and clinical 
information submitted in the application, is of the opinion that Palonosetron Accord is comparable to 
the reference product Aloxi in the applied indication and that no additional risk minimisation activities 
are required beyond those included in the product information. Therefore, the benefit risk balance for 
Palonosetron Accord is considered positive. 
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Palonosetron Accord in adults for the prevention of acute nausea and 
vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, the prevention of nausea and 
vomiting associated with moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, and in paediatric patients 1 
month of age and older for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting associated with highly 
emetogenic cancer chemotherapy and prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with moderately 
emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the 
marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:

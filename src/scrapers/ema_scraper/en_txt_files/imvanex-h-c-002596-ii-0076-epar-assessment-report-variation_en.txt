2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1 Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Monkeypox 
Monkeypox is a viral zoonosis caused by the monkeypox virus, a member of the orthopoxvirus family. It 
was first identified in 1958 and the first cases of monkeypox in humans were reported in the 1970s in the 
Central African region. Since then, monkeypox in humans has been reported repeatedly throughout Sub-
Saharan Africa, including West Africa and Central Africa, with rising frequency in recent years. Since 
2017, seven countries in the WHO Africa region have reported outbreaks and most have continued to 
occur in forested rural areas. However, countries are increasingly reporting monkeypox in previously 
unaffected regions; in Nigeria, of the more than 550 cases reported since the outbreak began in 2017 
(West Africa clade), many have occurred in urban and peri-urban areas. The Democratic Republic of the 
Congo (DRC) has reported over 1300 cases just from January 2022 to May 2022 (Congo Basin clade). 
Surveillance in all countries is expanding rapidly and WHO expects that more cases will be reported. 
Most recently, a multi-country monkeypox outbreak is spreading to previously non-endemic countries, 
mostly in the European region. According to the WHO situation report on Monkeypox on 7 July 2022, 
6,027 laboratory-confirmed cases of monkeypox and 3 deaths have been reported to the WHO from 59 
countries from the period of 1 January 2022 to 4 July 2022. Approximately 82% of the cases are in 
Europe, and 15% in the Americas, including more than 1000 confirmed cases in UK (1,351), Spain 
(1,256) and Germany (1,242), and 300 or more confirmed cases in Health Canada (300) and the United 
States (460). Based on the gender data available on 4,406 cases, men made up 99.5% of the cases, and 
men aged 18 to 44 years accounted for 79% of the cases.

In endemic countries, incidences of monkeypox virus infections in paediatric age groups are higher than 
in adult age groups, which might correlate with the lack of smallpox vaccine coverage as compared to 
older populations. However, in the last decades, the age of humans having monkeypox cases has 
gradually increased, probably in part due to growing proportions of the population without vaccination 
coverage, as smallpox was eradicated in 1980. 
The clinical course of monkeypox is similar to smallpox, although milder and with a substantially lower-
case fatality rate. After infection, there is an incubation period of roughly 1-2 weeks. Shortly after an 
initial febrile prodrome, potentially alongside with headache and fatigue, a rash will develop in many 
patients, as well as lymphadenopathy in cervical, inguinal or maxillary regions. Fever is frequently 
observed around the time of rash onset. The distinctive pox lesions begin to develop simultaneously and 
evolve together on any given part of the body, and the evolution of lesions progresses have been 
described through four stages, as first macular, later papular, then vesicular or pustular, scabbing over 
and resolving. The illness typically lasts 2-4 weeks. The severity of illness can depend upon the initial 
health of the individual, the route of exposure, and the strain of the infecting virus (West African vs. 
Central African virus genetic groups, or clades). West African monkeypox is associated with milder 
disease, fewer deaths, and limited human-to-human transmission. Human infections with the Central 
African monkeypox virus clade are typically more severe compared to those with the West African virus 
clade and have a higher mortality. Person-to-person spread is well-documented for Central African 
monkeypox virus. 
People who live with or have close contact (including sexual contact) with someone who has monkeypox, 
or who has regular contact with animals who could be infected, are most at risk of infection. Newborn 
infants, young children and people with underlying immune deficiencies may be at risk of more serious 
disease. 
Other orthopoxviruses  
In laboratories working with replicating orthopoxviruses such as vaccinia, accidental exposure of 
laboratory personnel is an occupational health risk. Cases of needle-stick injuries or similar accidents 
leading to local infections with replicating vaccinia have repeatedly been reported. In addition, there are 
rare case reports of other orthopoxvirus transmissions, such as human cowpox infections, mostly from 
pet rodents or cats of questionable origin. Previous smallpox vaccination decades ago was shown to lead 
to a milder clinical course in one of the reported cases. 
In addition, the recently published de novo synthesis of horsepox may have direct implications for 
biosecurity by facilitating potential synthesis of other orthopoxviruses, including variola, increasing the 
risk for emergence of new orthopoxvirus diseases. 
Other human orthopoxvirus infections, such as cowpox, follow a similar pattern, although the pox lesions 
may be less frequent and show fewer spread across the body. 
Management 
Control of monkeypox outbreaks primarily relies on public health measures including surveillance, 
contact-tracing, isolation and care of patients. 
Symptomatic treatment of orthopoxvirus infections includes close supervision of the patient and fluid 
replacement. Antibiotics are restricted to patients with bacterial superinfection. For specific treatment, 
tecovirimat is the only medicinal product approved in the European Union for the treatment of smallpox, 
monkeypox and cowpox in adults and children with body weight at least 13 kg. Tecovirimat works by 
interfering with a protein called VP37 that is found on the surface of orthopoxviruses. By interacting with 
this protein, the medicine prevents the viruses from reproducing normally, slowing down the spread of

infection. This medicinal product was approved based on testing in animal models using other 
orthopoxviruses than smallpox only.  
Vaccination with smallpox vaccines is expected to provide some protection against monkeypox, based on 
history data showing a vaccine efficacy of approximately 85% in a human monkeypox outbreak setting, in 
previously smallpox vaccinated individuals. A recent guidance document published by WHO recommends 
use of smallpox vaccines in the context of the monkeypox outbreak, dependent on individual risk 
assessment in both, pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis scenarios.  
In the EU, no prophylactic vaccines are specifically licensed for monkeypox or other orthopoxvirus 
infections. IMVANEX is currently approved in the EU for prevention of smallpox in adults.  
2.1.2.  About the product 
IMVANEX is a live, highly attenuated, non-replicating viral vaccine for protection against smallpox. The 
vaccine is suspension for injection. One dose (0.5 mL) contains modified vaccinia Ankara – Bavarian 
Nordic live virus no less than 5 x 107 infectious unit. 
IMVANEX is manufactured based on the manufacturer’s proprietary strain of the orthopoxvirus Modified 
Vaccinia Ankara-Bavarian Nordic (MVA-BN) that is grown in chicken embryo fibroblast cells, harvested, 
concentrated, and purified. 
IMVANEX was approved under exception circumstances in the EU on 31 July 2013 for active immunisation 
against smallpox in adults. 
The primary vaccination schedule consists of 2 doses of the vaccine administered subcutaneously at 
interval of no less than 28 days, whereas a single dose of 0.5 mL is considered for booster vaccination 
whenever necessary in individuals previously vaccinated against smallpox. For immunocompromised 
patients, two booster doses separated by 28 days or longer should be given. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The non-clinical aspect is restricted to the non-clinical pharmacology aspect, involving the non-clinical 
overview addendum and non-clinical summary, making a cross-reference to the prior existing non-clinical 
dossier. In addition, two additional animal efficacy studies were included as a confirmation of the existing 
non-clinical dossier. 
2.2.2.  Pharmacology 
Summary of monkeypox animal data 
As already covered in the non-clinical dossier of IMVANEX, the applicant tested the ability of IMVANEX to 
protect against lethal challenges with monkeypox virus (MPXV) when this was given by the intravenous, 
intratracheal or aerosol routes to non-human primates. The percentage of animals surviving the standard 
dose (1x108 Inf.U) challenges is summarised in the below Table. 
Assessment report  
EMA/683534/2022 
Page 7/42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 1: Summary of Imvanex-induced protection from death in monkeypox challenge models 
in NHP 
Recently, a non MAH-sponsored animal study was performed by the US CDC, to investigate post-
exposure prophylaxis of IMVANEX and ACAM2000 (a smallpox (Vaccinia) vaccine, live approved in the 
US), in the intranasal prairie dog challenge model (Keckler, 2020). Two times lethal dose (LD50) of 
monkeypox virus was administered intranasally first, followed by vaccination with either IMVANEX or 
ACAM2000 post-challenge. It was found that 7 out of 8 animals vaccinated with IMVANEX survived the 
challenge when the post-challenge vaccination was given one day after exposure, in contrast to 4 out of 8 
animals vaccinated with ACAM2000. Whereas only 3 out of 8 animals vaccinated with IMVANEX survived 
the challenge when the post-challenge vaccination was given on the third day post-exposure, contrasting 
with 5 out of 8 for ACAM2000. 
The initial application also covered non-clinical pharmacology studies on mice. Among these studies, 
there were intranasal challenge studies with a lethal dose of Vaccinia Virus Western Reserve (VV-WR) and 
Ectromelia Virus (ECTV) in mice. The applicant characterised testing with the challenge virus VV-WR 
strain given by the intranasal route. A dose-response for morbidity and mortality was shown and a dose 
equivalent to 50-fold the median lethal dose was taken forward for use in testing the protective efficacy 
of Imvanex. When mice previously vaccinated with Imvanex were then challenged with this lethal 
intranasal dose they survived. Subsequently methods were developed to challenge mice with ectromelia, 
an orthopoxvirus that naturally infects mice. The applicant showed that mice vaccinated with Imvanex 
were able to survive a lethal challenge with this virus, whereas unvaccinated mice did not. 
Two additional non-clinical studies submitted  
1. Comparison of the efficacy and immunogenicity of freeze-dried and liquid-frozen formulations of 
IMVAMUNE in the intravenous Monkeypox challenge model in Cynomolgus Macaques [BN-PRE-12-003] 
The objective of this GLP-compliant study was to compare the survival and morbidity of non-vaccinated 
and liquid-frozen or freeze-dried MVA-BN (indicated as IMVAMUNE in the study report) vaccinated Non-

Human Primates (NHP) after intravenous challenge with MPXV. In addition to efficacy, the 
immunogenicity of the liquid-frozen and freeze-dried MVA-BN formulations were evaluated. 
Groups of NHP received subcutaneous prime-boost vaccinations with 1x108 median Tissue Culture 
Infectious Dose (TCID50) of either liquid-frozen or freeze-dried MVA-BN, or were inoculated with Tris-
Buffered Saline (TBS) as controls on Study Days 0 and 28 (see Table below for study design).

Abbreviations: N = Number; TCID50 = Median Tissue Culture Infectious Dose; PFU = Plaque Forming Units 
Blood samples collected at different time-points prior to challenge were analysed for total vaccinia-
specific antibody titres by ELISA and for neutralising antibody titres by PRNT at Bavarian Nordic. 
On Study Day 63, animals were challenged by the intravenous route with a target MPXV dose of 5 x107 
Plaque Forming Units (PFU). 
Animals were examined for morbidity and mortality, clinical observations, body weights, body 
temperatures, and skin pox lesions. Whole blood and throat swabs were taken at assigned time points 
and tested for virus load by quantitative PCR assay. All NHPs were euthanized when deemed necessary, 
i.e., when moribund or on Study Day 91. For all animals found dead or euthanized a complete gross 
necropsy was conducted. 
Results: 
Vaccinia-specific total and neutralising antibody responses 
Prime-boost vaccination with 1x108 TCID50 of liquid-frozen MVA-BN (Group 2) or freeze-dried MVA-BN 
(Group 3) induced 100% seroconversion by ELISA and by PRNT with comparable Geometric Mean Titres 
(GMTs) between the groups. Statistical analysis of the peak response (Study Day 35) for ELISA and for 
PRNT revealed no significant difference between the two different formulations comparing Log10 titres 
measured either by ELISA or by PRNT. Further, vaccinia-specific total and neutralising antibodies 
responses did significantly correlate as illustrated in the figures below.

NHPs were vaccinated with liquid-frozen or freeze-dried MVA-BN on Study Day 0 and 28, or received Vehicle control (TBS). At various 
time-points sera were collected and analyzed by ELISA. Results are presented as the GMT together with the Standard Error of the Mean 
(SEM).

T-cell response (IFNγ ELISPOT) 
After stimulation of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) with Vaccinia virus Western Reserve (VV-
WR), animals vaccinated with liquid-frozen MVA-BN (Group 2) recorded a mean of 53 Spot Forming Cells 
(SFC) per 3x105 PBMC and animals that received freeze-dried MVA-BN (Group 3) had a mean of 66 SFC 
per 3x105 PBMC. Responses of both vaccinated groups were not significantly different. Importantly, 
background responses were absent or very low and non-vaccinated animals (Group 1) did not respond.

PBMC were prepared on Study Day -1 (prior to vaccination) and Study Day 56 (4 weeks post the booster vaccination with MVA-BN and 
stimulated in vitro with either medium alone or with VV-WR (Multiplicity of Infection [MOI] of 1). IFNγ producing cells were analyzed by 
ELISPOT and data are shown as spot forming cell (SFC) per 3x105 PBMC (±SEM).

Appearance post-challenge 
A summary of survival following challenge is shown below. 6 of 10 animals in the control groups died. All 
vaccinated animals survived the challenge irrespective of the formulation. The difference between the 
survival rate after challenge with MPXV of the control group (Group 1: 40% survival) and both vaccinated 
groups (Groups 2 and 3: 100% survival) was statistically significant. In the control group the first fatality 
occurred nine days after challenge, and the last fatalities (other than scheduled Study Day 91 euthanasia) 
occurred 15 days after challenge. 
Figure 4: Kaplan-Meier Plot of Survival 
The most common clinical signs in all groups were hunched posture, inappetence, oedema and 
dehydration. In the vaccinated animals (Groups 2 and 3), however, incidence and severity of clinical signs 
were markedly lower than in the control (Group 1). There was a significant difference between the mean 
clinical scores of the non-vaccinated control group and both vaccinated groups from days 7 to 20 post 
challenge. All adverse clinical signs resolved in surviving animals by the end of the study. The protective 
effect of vaccination was also apparent with regard to pock lesions, which were significantly fewer in 
vaccinated animals compared to non-vaccinated controls. Lesions in all surviving animals, regardless of 
group, resolved by the end of the study.

Skin lesions were counted every three days post challenge through Study Day 87 and Study Day 91. Group means (+/- SEM) are 
shown. Mean terminal values (+/- SEM) are shown for animals that succumbed prior to scheduled euthanasia (Group 1: five animals 
were euthanized, one animal was found dead). 
Figure 5: Group Mean Lesion Counts 
Body Weight Changes and Body Temperature Changes Post Challenge 
Statistical analysis of body weight and body temperature changes detected significant differences 
between the control and the two vaccinated groups. Body temperature change was also used as a 
criterion for euthanasia when the animal loses the ability to regulate its body temperature. There was a 
statistically significant differences between the vaccinated groups on scattered time points or over time 
periods in body weight and body temperature change detected. However, compared to differences 
between the control group and both vaccinated groups, differences between the two vaccinated groups 
were small and most likely due to variations in the biological system not indicating a tendency for an 
increased efficacy for one of the vaccines. 
Body weight (in kg) was measured on the day of challenge (baseline prior to challenge) and every three days thereafter until Study Day 
87 and Study Day 91. Body weight change (in %) from baseline was calculated and is shown as group mean (+/- SEM).

Viremia (Whole Blood) 
MPXV levels in the blood of vaccinated animals were significantly reduced compared to controls, and virus 
levels were undetectable in all but one vaccinated animal by the end of the study, whereas two of the 
four surviving control animals had detectable virus at the end of the study. However, genome numbers 
consistently decreased from Day 9 post challenge onwards and likely would have been below detectable 
limits and eliminated had the post challenge observation period been greater than 28 days. On days 6 to 
18 post-challenge the mean viral load of Group 3 (freeze-dried MVA-BN) was lower than that of Group 2 
(liquid-frozen MVA-BN); when all three groups were compared, on post-challenge day 9 the difference 
was statistically significant, but analysis comparing just Groups 2 and 3 did not confirm the significant 
difference. 
Viral load was measured in blood samples collected on the day of challenge and every three days thereafter until Study Day 87 and 
Study Day 91. Mean viral loads (log10 genomes/mL +/- SEM) for each group are shown. The Limit Of Quantification (LOQ) was 800 
genome copies/mL, i.e. 2.9 log10 scale. For calculation purposes for samples with signals below the quantification limit a value of 400 
genomes/mL, i.e. 2.6 log10 was used. Mean terminal values (+/- SEM) are shown for animals that succumbed prior to scheduled 
euthanasia 
Figure 7: Group Mean Log10 Blood Viral Load 
Virus shedding (Throat swab samples) 
MPXV was detected in throat swab material from all control animals and Group 2 and 3 animals three 
days post-challenge; by 6 and 9 days post-challenge the throat swabs of remaining Group 2 and 3 
animals were also virus-positive. A significant difference between the mean viral load in throat swabs of 
non-vaccinated animals (Group 1) and both vaccinated groups that received either liquid-frozen MVA-BN 
(Group 2) or freeze-dried MVA-BN (Group 3) was seen starting 6 days post challenge (Study Day 69) 
until the end of the observation period. Mean viral loads in throat swabs of Group 3 were lower than 
those of Group 2 at all post-challenge time points; on post-challenge days 15 to 24 the difference was 
significant.

Viral load was measured in throat swab samples collected on the day of challenge and every three days thereafter until Study Day 87 
and Study Day 91. Mean viral loads (log10 genomes/mL +/- SEM) for each group are shown. The LOQ was 167 genome copies/mL, i.e.

i.e. 1.92 log10 was used. Mean terminal values (+/- SEM) are shown for animals that succumbed prior to scheduled euthanasia (Group 
1: five animals were euthanized, one animal was found dead).

2. Comparison of the efficacy and immunogenicity of liquid-frozen and freeze-dried formulations of 
IMVAMUNE in the aerosol Monkeypox challenge model in Cynomolgus Macaques [BN-PRE-12-028] 
The objective of this GLP-compliant study was to compare the survival and morbidity of non-vaccinated 
and liquid-frozen or freeze-dried MVA-BN (indicated as IMVAMUNE in the study report) vaccinated NHP 
after inhalation/aerosol challenge with MPXV. In addition to efficacy, the immunogenicity of the liquid-
frozen and freeze-dried MVA-BN formulations were evaluated. 
Groups of NHP received SC prime-boost vaccinations with 1x108 TCID50 of either liquid-frozen or freeze-
dried MVA-BN, or were inoculated with TBS as controls on Study Days 0 and 28.

Results 
Vaccinia-specific total and neutralising antibody responses 
Prime-boost vaccination with 1x108 TCID50 of liquid-frozen MVA-BN (Group 2) or freeze-dried MVA-BN 
(Group 3) induced 100% seroconversion by ELISA and by PRNT with comparable GMTs between the 
groups. Statistical analysis of the peak response for ELISA on Study Day 35 and for PRNT on Study Day 
35 for Group 3 and Study Day 42 for Group 2, revealed no significant difference between the two 
different formulations comparing Log10 titers measured either by ELISA or by PRNT. Further, vaccinia-
specific total and neutralising antibody responses did significantly correlate. It was noted that one animal 
in Group 1 on Study Days 21 through 35 had low levels of antibodies recorded but these were considered 
false positive results due to matrix effect. 
NHPs were vaccinated with liquid-frozen or freeze-dried MVA-BN on Study Day 0 and 28, or received TBS. At various time-points sera 
were collected and analyzed by ELISA. Results are presented as the GMT together with the SEM.

Appearance post-challenge 
A summary of survival following challenge is shown below. All ten animals in the control group died or 
were euthanized (six were found dead and four met criteria for immediate euthanasia). All vaccinated 
animals survived the challenge irrespective of the formulation. The difference between the survival rate 
after challenge with MPXV of the control group (Group 1: 0% survival) and both vaccinated groups 
(Groups 2 and 3: 100% survival) was statistically significant. In the control group, the first fatalities 
occurred eight days after challenge, and the last fatality occurred 11 days after challenge. 
Figure 11: Kaplan-Meier Plot of Survival 
Adverse clinical signs post-challenge in the non-vaccinated animals included hunched posture 
(weakness), dehydration, inappetence, cough and less frequently dyspnoea, nasal and ocular discharge 
and oedema. In both liquid-frozen and freeze-dried MVA-BN vaccinated groups most of these clinical 
signs, except dyspnoea, also occurred, but with reduced incidence and severity compared to control 
animals. Clinical scores were significantly higher in the control group compared to either vaccinated group 
from Day 6 to Day 9 post-challenge. All adverse clinical signs resolved in surviving animals by the end of 
the study observation period. The protective effect of vaccination was also apparent with regard to pock 
lesions, in which vaccinated animals exhibited a significantly lower number of pock lesions compared to 
non-vaccinated controls on Day 9 post-challenge. 
Skin lesions were counted every three days post challenge through Study Day 87 and Study Day 91. Group means (+/- SEM) are 
shown. Mean terminal values (+/- SEM) are shown for animals that succumbed prior to scheduled euthanasia (Group 1: four animals 
were euthanized, six animals were found dead).

Body weight changes and body temperature changes post-challenge 
Following MPXV challenge, the mean body temperature and body weight of non-vaccinated animals 
continued to decline until all non-vaccinated animals had succumbed. Body temperature change was also 
used as a criterion for euthanasia since it indicates when the animal loses the ability to regulate its body 
temperature. Statistical analysis of body weight changes detected significant differences between the 
control and the two vaccinated groups. In addition, freeze-died MVA-BN vaccinated animals tended to 
have a greater weight gain post challenge than animals vaccinated with the liquid-frozen formulation. 
However, no significant differences between the two vaccinated groups were detected for other clinical 
parameters (viral load, clinical scores, skin lesion counts) in the current study. Thus, differences between 
liquid-frozen (Group 2) and freeze-dried MVA-BN (Group 3) vaccinated groups in terms of body weights 
were most likely due to variations in the biological system and do not indicate a tendency for increased 
efficacy for one of the vaccines. 
Body weight (in kg) was measured on the day of challenge (baseline prior to challenge) and every three days thereafter until Study Day 
87 and Study Day 91. Body weight change (in %) from baseline was calculated and is shown as group mean (+/- SEM). 
Figure 13: Group Mean Body Weight Change 
Viremia (Whole Blood) 
MPXV levels in the blood of vaccinated animals were significantly reduced compared to controls, and virus 
levels were undetectable in most vaccinated animals by the end of the study. However, genome numbers 
consistently decreased from Day 9 post challenge onwards and likely would have been below detectable 
limits and eliminated had the post challenge observation period been greater than 28 days. There was no 
significant difference between blood viral loads of the two vaccinated groups.

Viral load was measured in blood samples collected prior to challenge and on the day of challenge and every three days thereafter until 
Study Day 87 and Study Day 91. Mean viral loads (log10 copies/mL +/- SEM) for each group are shown. The LOQ was 800 genome 
copies/mL, i.e. 2.9 log10 scale. For calculation purposes for samples with signals below the quantification limit a value of 400 
genomes/mL, i.e. 2.6 log10 was used. Mean terminal values (+/- SEM) are shown for animals that succumbed prior to scheduled 
euthanasia.

Virus shedding (Throat swab samples) 
As illustrated below, MPXV was detected in throat swab material from most control Group 1 animals and 
most Group 2 and 3 animals at three days post-challenge; by 6 days post-challenge the throat swabs of 
remaining animals were also virus positive as well as the animals that were positive on Day 3 post-
challenge. In throat swabs of vaccinated groups, the mean level of virus was significantly reduced 
compared to peak values in non-vaccinated controls. Vaccinations did not completely eliminate virus 
shedding in the oral cavity, and virus was longer detectable in throat swabs than in blood. There was no 
significant difference between throat swab viral loads of the two vaccinated groups based on quantitative 
PCR.

167 genome copies/mL, i.e. 2.22 log10 scale. For calculation purposes for samples with signals below the quantification limit a value of

2.2.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Submission strategy 
The non-clinical aspects are exclusively restricted to the non-clinical pharmacology, involving the non-
clinical overview addendum and non-clinical summary, making a cross-reference to the existing non-
clinical dossier. In addition, two additional animal efficacy studies were included as a confirmation of the 
existing non-clinical dossier. 
Non-clinical pharmacology studies 
From existing non-clinical dossier, a total of 4 animal efficacy studies in NHPs using 3 challenge models 
(intravenous, intratracheal or aerosol routes) were summarised to assess the ability of IMVANEX to 
protect against lethal challenges with MPXV. In each challenge model, two subcutaneous injections with 
IMVANEX 28 days apart, at doses ranging from 106 to 108 TCID50, induced 60–100% protection from the 
death of MPXV-challenged animals. Single vaccination with 1x108 TCID50 of IMVANEX also provided 88-
100% protection in the intravenous (IV), intratracheal (i.t.) or aerosol routes challenge models. 
Two additional animal studies submitted in this variation contribute to enlarged evidence for efficacy of 
IMVANEX in preventing severe MPX disease and death of the MPXV-challenged NHPs in IV and aerosol 
challenge models. Data across different outcomes (survival, clinical, disease/lesions, and virology/virus 
load) are consistent. 
These animal efficacy data in different NHP challenge studies are important and lead to reasonable 
expectation that IMVANEX could induce protection against monkeypox in humans. Additionally, a post-
authorisation efficacy study is imposed as part of the marketing authorisation to be able to obtain 
effectiveness data against monkeypox in humans in the case of an outbreak (refer to the clinical section). 
Whenever measured in the protected animals that were vaccinated with IMVANEX, anti-vaccinia humoral 
and cellular immune responses, including binding and neutralising antibodies in the blood, were 
evidenced. 
Assessment report  
EMA/683534/2022 
Page 19/42 
 
 
 
 
 
From existing non-clinical dossier, several animal efficacy studies in mice demonstrated that 2 doses (108 
TCID50) of IMVANEX at 28 day interval induced significant systemic immunity and protected mice from a 
lethal intranasal challenge of other orthopoxviruses: replicating vaccinia virus (WR-VV strain) and the 
Ectromelia virus (ECTM, mousepox). This mouse efficacy data against WR-VV generated for IMVANEX is 
considered of good quality and is relevant to this variation, and thus reflected in the product information. 
Lastly, the notified literature data that show protection of IMVANEX against MPX after post-exposure 
prophylaxis (PEP) use in prairie dogs is interesting. Nevertheless, outside of the scope of this extension of 
indication. 
Based on the non-clinical data assessed, there is no cross-neutralisation data for cowpox. Upon request, 
the MAH withdrew during the procedure the indication for active immunisation against “related 
orthopoxvirus”, keeping it limited to the addition of monkeypox and vaccinia virus in view of the data 
submitted. 
2.2.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The submitted non-clinical data are of adequate quantity and quality and considered pivotal to infer 
efficacy of IMVANEX in this variation for the active immunisation against monkeypox and vaccinia virus, 
especially in the absence of human efficacy data.  
Considering the above data, smallpox and monkeypox vaccine (live modified vaccinia virus Ankara) is not 
expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
GCP 
Reference is made two three studies: 
The submitted protocol of US CDC open-label prospective cohort study in DRC was approved by CDC 
Institutional Review Board (IRB) and the KSPH IRB. No CSR including a GCP-compliance statement has 
been submitted. 
The submitted protocol of UK cohort surveillance study was said to be conducted in compliance with the 
principles set out in the Declaration of Helsinki and where applicable, the principles of GCP. No CSR 
including a GCP-compliance statement has been submitted. 
The study POX-MVA-006, assessed in the context of EMEA/H/C/002596/II/0036, used to support this 
extension of indication was claimed to be conducted in compliance with the principles set out in the 
Declaration of Helsinki and where applicable, the principles of GCP.  
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH has not performed any clinical trials with the objective of assessing clinical efficacy against 
monkeypox. 
Additional studies (protocols, preliminary results, without final CSR) are submitted: 
•  US CDC surveillance clinical trial in DRC: An open-label prospective cohort study of IMVAMUNE 
Smallpox vaccine in adult healthcare personnel at risk for Monkeypox in the DRC.

• 
Public Health England surveillance trial in the UK: A cohort study of serological responses to MVA-
BN Smallpox Vaccine (Imvanex) administered during a Monkeypox outbreak in the UK. 
The MAH provided up-to-date overview of IMVANEX efficacy and safety.  
2.3.2.  Clinical efficacy 
Clinical data supporting the monkeypox indication 
The MAH has not performed any clinical trials with the objective of assessing either immunogenicity or 
clinical efficacy against monkeypox. 
US CDC surveillance clinical trial in DRC 
This is a single-arm, open-label designed study without a formal, statistical testing for efficacy. 
Eligible subjects (male and non-pregnant female adults aged 18 years and older, health care personnel at 
risk, regardless of history of prior smallpox vaccination) receive two doses of IMVANEX (licensed liquid-
frozen formulation, or unlicensed freeze-dried formulation) administered on days 0 and 28 via 
subcutaneous injection. 
The primary outcome measures include the proportion of subjects who develop suspected or confirmed 
monkeypox infection, as well as the proportion of subjects who experience exposure to MPXV, both in a 
2-year time frame after initial vaccination. 
Secondary objectives are to evaluate immunogenicity of IMVAMUNE in adult participants following receipt 
of one and two doses of the vaccine and to evaluate the safety, including SAEs and pregnancies. 
The available exposure and safety data from this trial have continuously been reported in the routine, 6-
monthly PSURs. 
The numbers of enrolled, vaccinated and analyzed: 
Information on the overall enrollment and data collected and analyzed on the study participants through 
6-Jul-2021 (latest annual report), is presented in the below Table. 
998 eligible participants received at least one dose of the liquid frozen formulation of IMVANEX in 2017 
(Cohort 1), and 600 additional participants (Cohort 2) received at least one dose of a newly developed 
freeze-dried formulation of the vaccine. 
In cohort 1, >97% received both scheduled doses and >88% completed all trial procedures up to the end 
of the 2-year follow-up period. In cohort 2, >95% received both scheduled doses and >85% completed 
all trial procedures up to the 1.5-year follow-up timepoint.

Number of cases of monkeypox: 
Across all ~1600 trial participants, no cases of monkeypox disease were observed in the 2-year follow-up 
period as per trial protocol. However, one participant of the Cohort 1 developed Monkeypox in November 
2019, 2.5 years after the second dose of trial vaccine. 
The participant who developed Monkeypox in November 2019 was a 45-year-old male (42-year-old at the 
time of vaccination) and completed the two-year study monitoring period in June 2019. The participant 
was previously vaccinated with Smallpox vaccine. Lesion samples were collected as part of routine 
surveillance and laboratory testing confirmed the presence of an orthopoxvirus infection (presumably 
Monkeypox given local epidemiology). Serology data from this participant showed a weak anti-
orthopoxvirus IgG response which peaked at day 42 and was undetectable at day 730. 
Table 5: IgG and IgM response for single vaccinia-experience participant who developed 
monkeypox 2.5 years after MVA-BN vaccination. 
The MAH noticed that the previously described annual incidence of monkeypox infections in healthcare 
workers of this region was 17.4/10000. In a population of 1600 observed over a 2-year period, the 
expected number of monkeypox cases would therefore be approximately between 5 and 6. 
Preliminary results of immunogenicity: 
During this reporting period, CDC conducted additional immunogenicity analyses based on samples 
collected from participants in Cohort 1. Additional immunogenicity analyses continued throughout the 
next reporting period. 
Immune response was assessed using a validated ELISA (vaccinia assay specificities). Updated results of 
preliminary analyses of IgG immune response and seroconversion by prior smallpox vaccination status 
and follow-up day are shown below. Participants who received smallpox vaccination during childhood 
(vaccinia-experienced) had higher IgG concentrations compared to vaccinia-naïve participants.

Figure 16: IgG response for Cohort 1 participants by prior Smallpox Vaccination status 
Persistence of IgG antibodies waned over the follow-up period.  
Results of IgM immune responses are shown below. 
Table 7: IgM response and seroconversion for Cohort 1 participants 
Figure 17: IgM response for Cohort 1 participants by prior Smallpox vaccination status 
Data showed that IgM response is higher in vaccinia-naïve than in vaccinia-experienced, presumably due 
to residual immunity to orthopoxviruses in the latter cohort.  
IgG response peaked 2 weeks post dose 2 of the vaccine in vaccinia-naïve cohort, pointing to a need for 
2-dose series primary vaccination in this cohort. Overall, the IgG response (GMT, and to some extent 
SCR) is lower at month 6 and afterwards, in vaccinia-naïve than vaccinia-experienced subjects. 
PRNT for vaccinia virus (Western Reserve strain) and monkeypox virus (West African strain) was 
conducted on a limited set of 73 samples at key timepoints: Day 0 (pre-vaccination), Day 42 (peak 
response after vaccination), and Day 730 (end of study to assess longevity of responses). Results are 
shown in below.

Table 8: Geometric mean titres and seroconversion rates (PRNT) in cohort 1 by prior smallpox 
vaccination status 
Figure 18: Serum neutralization of vaccinia virus (western reserve strain) for cohort 1 
The vaccinia-specific PRNT data resembled those in the existing clinical dossier (also see POX-MVA-006 
below), although Day 42 peak VACV-PRNT titers were relatively higher in this CDC study than that in the 
previous experience. More interesting are results of monkeypox-specific PRNT response, which peaked at 
day 42, similar to the previous experience with vaccinia specific PRNT. The durability of monkeypox-
neutralization response was similar to the vaccinia one, with responses declining but still detectable up to 
year 2 post vaccination in vaccinia-experienced subjects. Based on these very limited data (N=73 in 
total), the Day 42 peak monkeypox-specific PRNT titers were overall lower in vaccinia-naïve than in 
vaccinia-experienced subjects. It should be noted that the PRNT assay for monkeypox is qualified and not 
fully validated. 
No further information is available about seroconversion rates in vaccinia-naïve subjects nor the 95% 
confidence interval values, and it is unclear whether data were also accrued at early time points, e.g. day 
7/day 14. 
Public Health England surveillance trial in the UK 
This is an observational prospective cohort study without a formal, statistical testing for efficacy. 
Eligible subjects (adult healthcare workers that have received Imvanex for pre-exposure or post-exposure 
prophylaxis against monkeypox during the 2018 UK monkeypox outbreak) were tested for anti-
orthopoxvirus serological responses. 
The primary outcome measure in this surveillance project was antibody responses (GMT, SCR) to vaccinia 
virus at a single time point between days 28 and 56 following first dose of Imvanex. 
Assessment report  
EMA/683534/2022 
Page 24/42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The secondary outcome measures included antibody response (GMT, SCR) that neutralizes the specific 
monkeypox viruses involved in the UK outbreak, and also reference monkeypox viruses, and anti-vaccinia 
GMT and SCR at day 14 following the second dose of Imvanex in a subset of individuals, and safety. 
Despite the primary objective of the study, no serological data were submitted and no CSR is available. 
Reporting cases of monkeypox: 
The MAH provided a descriptive summary based on an interim publication (Vaughan, 2018).It was 
reported that 89 subjects had received IMVANEX as post exposure prophylaxis (at least one single shot of 
no less than 5x107 Inf.U), thereof 84 considered of intermediate risk and 5 considered as high-risk 
contacts. One case of monkeypox infection in a vaccinated subject was reported. 
This healthcare worker was involved in the changing of potentially contaminated bedding from a patient 
with multiple skin lesions (before the monkeypox diagnosis was considered in this patient). The 
healthcare worker received post-exposure vaccination only after 5 days after the most recent exposure, 
and 6 to 7 days after the earliest exposure therefore missing the optimal timing. This subject then 
developed skin lesions consistent with monkeypox, with onset 8 days after vaccination, finally confirmed 
by PCR. The subject later recovered from this infection. 
The target vaccination window was set for less than 4 days and up to maximum 14 days from exposure. 
The patient was vaccinia-naïve and received first dose of IMVANEX before symptom onset, vaccination 
was >4 days after the most recent exposure, which may be too late to prevent monkeypox. Nevertheless, 
post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) use indication has not been regulatorily approved, and the optimal 
timing for post-exposure vaccination with Imvanex remains unknown. 
The history of previous smallpox vaccination was not reported for these 89 exposed subjects. 
Additional expected surveillances in the context of the current outbreak 
The MAH has actively searched interaction with public health agencies of countries who are starting 
vaccine implementation programs. 
The MAH informed that so far from all public health agencies contacted, registries of vaccinees are kept, 
although it is unknown about what details to be captured in registries. The MAH noted that several 
agencies have decided to perform active surveillance, safety or effectiveness analysis, with protocols still 
under development. Further details of the planned study will be described in the updated IMVANEX Risk 
Management Plan (RMP). 
The MAH envisions to have a reasonable number of data share agreements with various registry owners 
across EU, UK, Canada and US, as well as other rest of world countries, in place, in order to present any 
of this data adding on to the overall benefit risk assessment of IMVANEX as soon as available, in 
respective aggregate reports. 
Clinical data supporting prophylaxis against related orthopoxviruses 
To support the indication extension to related orthopoxviruses infection and disease in adults 18 years 
and older, the MAH presented data of an existing clinical trial POX-MVA-006 assessed in variation with 
procedure number EMEA/H/C/002596/II/0036. According to the MAH, the attenuation of the take can be 
considered as a useful outcome measure, as it is a direct vaccine efficacy measure against replicating 
vaccinia virus strains as used in the traditional smallpox vaccines. 
The study was set up in collaboration with the USAMRIID and conducted in a US military population 
stationed in the Yongsan Garrison in South Korea. The study enrolled exclusively healthy, vaccinia-naïve 
subjects, as they are considered the population most vulnerable to smallpox infection and preferred to 
demonstrate the protective efficacy of a new smallpox vaccine due to their vaccinia-naïve immune status.

Details about the design are provided in the following Table. 
Table 9: Design of pivotal phase III trial POX-MVA-006 
The co-primary objectives were to demonstrate efficacy of IMVANEX by: 
•  Demonstrating non-inferiority of IMVANEX compared to ACAM2000, in terms of vaccinia specific 
PRNT antibody response at Day 42 for IMVANEX and Day 28 for ACAM2000; non-inferiority was 
met if 2-sided 95% CI of GMTs ratio (Group 1/Group 2) is entirely above 0.5. 
•  Showing that vaccination with IMVANEX prior to scarification with ACAM2000 results in an 
attenuation of the take; the endpoint was met if 95% CI of the Area Attenuation Ratio (AAR), 
reflecting the reduction in the Maximum Lesion Area (MLA), was significantly above 40%. 
Results of immunogenicity first-primary endpoint 
The first primary endpoint of the trial was met. At the Peak Visits (Day 42/Week 6 for Group 1 and Day 
28/Week 4 for Group 2), GMTs were 153.5 and 79.3 for Groups 1 and 2, respectively, with a Group 
1/Group 2 ratio of 1.935 (95% CI: 1.562, 2.397), demonstrating non-inferiority of IMVANEX to 
ACAM2000. 
Since the 95% CI of the Group 1/Group 2 ratio at the Peak Visit is entirely above 1, meeting the criterion 
for superiority of IMVANEX over ACAM2000 as well. The individual Peak GMTs were 201.5 and 117.8 for 
Groups 1 and 2, respectively, with a Group 1/Group 2 ratio of 1.710 (95% CI: 1.421, 2.059), confirming 
the results obtained for the Peak Visit, see Table 3. 
Table 10: PRNT non-inferiority at peak visit in POX-MVA-006 (PP set for immunogenicity, 
N=371) 
The post-hoc analysis on GMT data obtained after the 1 dose of IMVANEX, applying same non-inferiority 
margin, revealed that PRNT GMT in Group 1 (IMVANEX) was non-inferior to Group 2 (ACAM2000) already

at Week 2 (GMTs were 16.2 for both Groups 1 and 2; GMT ratio: 0.997, 95% CI: 0.738, 1.348). This 
aspect may have implication for potential post-event emergency settings. 
The kinetics of neutralising antibody responses of Group 1 (IMVANEX) versus Group 2 (ACAM2000) are 
displayed below.

strain) among Participants in the Per-Protocol Population for Immunogenicity. Source: Pittman 
et al., 2019 
Results of efficacy (lesion area) co-primary endpoint 
The co-primary endpoint of the trial was met. The observed Maximum Lesion Area (MLA) reduction (take 
attenuation) of 97.9% (95% CI: 96.6%, 98.3%) was significantly greater than the pre-specified threshold 
of 40% agreed to by the FDA as a clinically relevant reduction of the take. Results of this trial are already 
reflected in the current SmPC.

2.3.2.1.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
IMVANEX was authorised under exceptional circumstances in the EU in 2013 for active immunisation 
against smallpox in adults. In response to the current monkeypox outbreak, the MAH submitted this 
variation to the EU to extend the current indication to monkeypox and related orthopoxvirus infection and 
disease in adults. 
Clinical data in support of extension to Monkeypox indication 
Clinical studies to assess efficacy and immunogenicity of IMVANEX against monkeypox disease are very 
limited. The MAH did not conduct any such trials designed to generate informative data. 
Assessment report  
EMA/683534/2022 
Page 27/42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The MAH provided limited results of two cohort clinical studies sponsored by US CDC and UK.  
In the CDC study conducted in DRC, approximately 1600 healthy adult healthcare workers received 
primary series of IMVANEX and then monitored for occurrence of monkeypox disease. No case of 
monkeypox disease was observed in the 2-year follow-up period as per trial protocol, whereas one 
participant developed monkeypox at 2.5 years after the second dose of trial vaccine. According to the 
previously described annual incidence of human monkeypox infections in healthcare workers of this 
region (17.4/10000), the expected number of human monkeypox cases, in a population of 1600 observed 
over a 2-year period, would be approximately between 5 and 6. This information must be interpreted with 
caution, given serious limitations of design of this CDC study, such as use of single-arm and historical 
control and without a formal statistical testing for efficacy. 
Based on the information and the study design, there is not a clear conclusion on efficacy of the study 
vaccine. There is uncertainty regarding if the confounding factors, including pre-existing immunity to 
Monkeypox were sufficiently controlled between the studied population and the population of healthcare 
workers of this region. 
The CDC study also included some preliminary immunogenicity data as regards IMVANEX-induced 
antibody response, including monkeypox neutralising antibodies in 73 IMVANEX recipients (30 vaccinia-
naïve, 43 vaccinia-experienced). This assay was not fully validated but qualified, which can be acceptable 
as this study is considered supportive. The results of monkeypox-specific PRNT response, which peaked 
at day 42, was similar to the previous experience with vaccinia specific PRNT. The durability of 
monkeypox-neutralization response was also similar to the vaccinia one, with responses declining but still 
detectable up to year 2 post vaccination in vaccinia-experienced subjects. It is acknowledged that 
interpretation of this type of data may be challenging in the absence of an established immune correlate 
of protection. 
In UK study (interim publication), 89 adults received IMVANEX as PEP, one case of monkeypox infection 
was reported. The study has no concurrent control arm nor a formal statistical testing for efficacy. 
Therefore, this study is not conclusive either. Despite the primary objective of the study, no serological 
data were submitted. 
Therefore, the ability of IMVANEX to prevent monkeypox in humans is presently inferred primarily (if not 
exclusively) from the animal efficacy data (see non-clinical discussion), in view of the lack of feasibility for 
conducting clinical efficacy studies. Due to the complexities and challenges to run a large-scale study, and 
to avoid any unnecessary delay in approval of the monkeypox indication, it is acceptable the generation 
of effectiveness data as a post-marketing commitment imposed in the marketing authorisation.  
Clinical data submitted to support the extension of indication to related orthopoxvirus 
infection and disease 
The initial MAA dossier included several clinical trials that have demonstrated the ability of IMVANEX to 
induce serum antibodies neutralising different vaccinia strains (WR-VV, IHD-J) in the vaccinia-naïve and 
vaccinia-experienced adults. 
In this variation, the MAH presented key results of a pivotal phase 3 clinical trial (POX-MVA-006) which 
data are already reflected in the SmPC. 
This trial demonstrated non-inferior immunogenicity of IMVANEX to ACAM2000 (2nd generation replicating 
smallpox vaccine, derivative of NYCBH vaccinia strain), in 18-42 year old healthy vaccinia-naïve subjects. 
The peak vaccinia-specific PRNT titre (WR-VV strain) was 153.5 (95%CI: 134.3; 175.6) 2-week post-dose 
2 in PP population (N=185) of IMVANEX recipients (2 doses 28 days apart, 1x108 TCID50/SC), whereas it 
was 79.3 (95%CI: 67.1, 93.8) in PP population (N=186) of ACAM2000 vaccine recipients (single dose, 
2.5-12.5x105 pfu/scarification). Also of interest is that a single dose of IMVANEX induced comparable 
Assessment report  
EMA/683534/2022 
Page 28/42 
 
 
 
 
vaccinia-neutralising antibody response, as did ACAM2000, at 2-week time point, a time when replicating 
smallpox vaccines are considered protective based on the traditional readout of take formation. 
More importantly, this trial demonstrated that vaccination with IMVANEX, ahead of scarification with 
ACAM2000 (2.5-12.5x105 pfu/scarification), prevented the growth of the replicating vaccinia virus of 
ACAM2000 vaccine in the vast majority of subjects, corresponding to an efficacy of 97.9% (95% CI: 
96.6%, 98.3%). This convincing data supports the prophylaxis use of IMVANEX against vaccinia virus 
disease, particularly in the occupational setting for laboratory employees working with replicating vaccinia 
virus. 
Based on the clinical data assessed, the effect of IMVANEX on preventing cowpox has not been 
specifically investigated. The notable rarity or sporadic nature of reported human cowpox disease makes 
it infeasible to conduct human efficacy trial with IMVANEX, either pre-licensure or in a post-marketing 
setting. It might be of value to accrue data on cowpox-neutralising antibody response in IMVANEX 
recipients during deployment of the vaccine (post-marketing), to ascertain immunogenicity of IMVANEX in 
humans. Lack of any data, including animal data, specific for cowpox raised concerns. Upon request, the 
MAH withdrew the indication for active immunisation against “related orthopoxvirus”, keeping it limited to 
the addition of monkeypox and vaccinia virus in view of the data submitted. 
The data assessed could not conclude on the confirmation of prevention of infection against related 
orthopoxvirus. Upon request, the MAH withdrew the indication for prevention of infection against related 
orthopoxvirus.   
2.3.2.2.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The submitted clinical data as well as existing clinical data in initial Marketing Authorisation Application 
(MAA) dossier, together with robust non-clinical data available, are of adequate quantity and quality to 
infer IMVANEX efficacy against monkeypox and vaccinia virus.  
The MAH is committed to engage in collaboration with the national health authorities where the IMVANEX 
vaccine is deployed, to perform an effectiveness study with IMVANEX so as to generate confirmatory 
data. 
The following measures (SOB) is considered necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
To ensure adequate monitoring of safety and effectiveness, the applicant should perform the following 
study to collect data where IMVANEX is used as a prophylactic vaccine and/or use in case of (re)-
emergence of circulating Monkeypox: 
•  Non-interventional post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES): An observational, non-interventional 
post-authorisation safety and efficacy study for the prophylactic vaccination with IMVANEX 
following (re)-emergence of circulating Monkeypox infections. The study should start as soon as 
possible after the start of the outbreak. 
2.3.3.  Clinical safety 
The MAH provided an overview of safety of IMVANEX in the clinical overview addendum. The overall 
safety profile of IMVANEX has previously been included in the dossier and has been updated with routine 
PSURs in 6-monthly intervals. The size of database consists of total >10,700 subjects to date, including 
both formulations (liquid frozen and freeze-dried formulation) from clinical trials. 
Assessment report  
EMA/683534/2022 
Page 29/42 
 
 
 
 
Very commonly reported adverse events in the currently approved liquid frozen formulation (according to 
Section 4.8 of the EU SmPC) are local and systemic reactions, such as injection site pain, erythema, 
swelling, induration and pruritus, or headache, fatigue, myalgia and nausea. 
In this variation, safety information is provided specifically for the two clinical studies mentioned in the 
efficacy section above. 
CDC surveillance trial in DRC 
Below described safety information is from submitted 2 annual reports. The MAH stated that a summary 
of SAEs and pregnancies from this trial was presented in routine PSURs and there were no SAEs related 
to study vaccine. 
Non-serious Adverse Events (AEs) through 24-Jul-2020: 
Analysis of immediate vaccine reactions among Cohort 1 showed that arthralgia, headache, dizziness, 
chills, and pruritis were reported by six study participants 30 minutes following vaccine administration. 
However, none were reported as SAEs and most reported these symptoms prior to vaccine 
administration. Furthermore, these expected AEs occurred in ≤0.1% of the total population receiving the 
study vaccine and this rate is lower than that seen in previous clinical trials. 
Similarly, the frequency of mild-moderate adverse events reported to occur within 7 days of receiving the 
study vaccine was compared to previously published clinical trial data. With the exception of fever, all 
such adverse events were found to occur at significantly lower frequencies in the current study compared 
to previous MVA-BN clinical trial data. For ease of reference, adverse event data for Cohort 1 previously 
reported in last year’s Annual Report are included below . 
Safety data from Cohort 2 is currently being finalized in the database so that similar analyses can be 
performed and comparisons made between the two cohorts. No SAEs occurred within 30 minutes of 
vaccine administration of study participants in both cohorts.

Serious adverse events 
As of 6 July 2021, no SAEs have been determined to be related to study vaccine nor meeting the 
requirements (i.e., serious, unexpected, suspected adverse reaction) for the submission of Investigation 
New Drug (IND) safety reports. 
Deaths 
A cumulative total of 16 study participant deaths have been reported through 6-Jul-2021. 12 deaths 
among Cohort 1 that received liquid-frozen formulation of the study vaccine and 4 deaths among Cohort 
2 that received lyophilized formulation of the study vaccine. No deaths have been deemed related to 
study vaccine by the local study physician or safety monitors as they occurred temporally distant from 
vaccine administration and/or alternate aetiologies were present to explain each death. Of the 16 deaths 
investigated by the local study physician, the following causes of death were identified: acute hepatitis 
and severe anaemia; skin infection of the leg (distant from the vaccine site injection); cerebral vascular 
accident secondary to hypertension; alcohol intoxication (n=2); cerebral vascular accident secondary to 
HIV infection and cryptococcal meningitis; traumatic head injury; acute gastroenteritis associated with 
severe malaria; opportunistic infections/AIDS; hepatic cirrhosis; suspected complications of tuberculosis; 
hepatic cancer and hepatitis B virus infection; suspect myocardial infarction; stroke in the context of 
acquired immunodeficiency (HIV/AIDS); hypertensive cardiopathy; and scrotal hernia complicated by 
septic shock. 
According to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs the annual death rate in DRC 
is 9.6 deaths/1,000 population based on estimates from 2017. By comparison, the current annual death 
rate among the study participant population is 2.9 deaths/1,000 (16 deaths/1600 study participants / 3.5 
years x 1,000 population). For this reason, the number of deaths seen in participants to date is not 
unexpected for this population. 
Assessment report  
EMA/683534/2022 
Page 32/42 
 
 
 
 
 
From the 16 reported deaths, 4 deaths included neurologic or thrombotic/thromboembotic events: stroke 
in the context of acquired immunodeficiency (HIV/AIDS); hypertensive cardiopathy; cerebral vascular 
accident secondary to hypertension; cerebral vascular accident secondary to HIV infection and 
cryptococcal meningitis. Narratives of these 4 events were provided: 
Stroke in the context of acquired immunodeficiency (HIV/AIDS): An adult patient of unknown 
gender and age was vaccinated with two doses of Jynneos (IMVANEX vaccine name in the United States) 
on day 0 and day 28, and on an unspecified date, an unknown amount of time after vaccination with 
Jynneos, the patient experienced reportedly “stroke in the context of acquired immunodeficiency”. The 
patient's further relevant medical history and concomitant medications were not provided. Stroke has 
often been reported as a complication of AIDS. Given the alternative explanation provided the company 
follows the reporter’s assessment – not related to vaccine.  
Hypertensive cardiopathy: An adult patient of unknown gender and age was vaccinated with two doses 
of Jynneos on day 0 and day 28. An unknown amount of time after vaccination with Jynneos, the patient 
experienced hypertensive cardiopathy. The patient's relevant medical history and concomitant 
medications were not provided. Given the unknown comorbidities, unspecified temporal relationship, and 
lack of information on any further circumstances surrounding the event, the company follows the 
reporter’s assessment as not related to vaccine.  
Cerebral vascular accident secondary to hypertension: An adult patient of unknown gender and age 
experienced a serious event of cerebral vascular accident secondary to hypertension an unknown amount 
of time after the vaccination with 2 doses of Jynneos. The patient's relevant medical history and 
concomitant medications as per initial report includes “secondary to hypertension”. Hypertension is 
known as a potential risk factor for cerebrovascular accident. Given the very limited information available 
the company follows the reporter’s assessment – not related to vaccine. 
Cerebral vascular accident secondary to HIV infection and cryptococcal meningitis: An adult 
patient (44-year-old), received the first dose of Jynneos on an unknown date and the second dose on 28-
Aug-2017. On 19-Oct-2017, 52 days after vaccine, the subject experienced reportedly a cerebral vascular 
accident secondary to HIV infection and cryptococcal meningitis. On the same day the patient died. Given 
the limited information available, the company follows the reporter’s assessment – not related to vaccine 
but other comorbidities. The cerebral vascular accident occurred 52 days after the second vaccination, 
which does not appear to point to a temporal relationship. Considering the presence of HIV infection and 
cryptococcal meningitis diagnosis, it can be agreed that death of this patient is unrelated to IMVANEX 
vaccine.  
For the previous first three cases of death, very limited information was available making challenging to 
conduct a causality assessment. First of all, a temporal relationship cannot be; secondly, alternative 
explanation exists which suggests that the occurrence of the death may not necessarily be associated 
with the study vaccine.  
In summary, taking into account the reported country-specific death background incidences, as well as 
comorbidities likely attributing to all fatal outcomes, the MAH agreed with the CDC assessment of 
unrelated to vaccine and there are no safety signals from this trial, as per the current information 
available.  
In addition, in the CDC study, there was one suspect myocardial infarction assessed as unrelated by the 
local study physician, which contains only limited information, with unspecified temporal relationship, 
unknown comorbidities, and lack of information on any further circumstances surrounding the event. 
Given the unknown comorbidities, unspecified temporal relationship, and lack of information on any 
Assessment report  
EMA/683534/2022 
Page 33/42 
 
 
 
 
further circumstances surrounding the event, the company follows the reporter’s assessment as not 
related to vaccine.  
Participant pregnancies 
As of 6 July 2021, a total of 14 female study participants became pregnant within 6 months of receiving 
the study vaccine, 4 among Cohort 1 that received liquid-frozen formulation of the study vaccine and 10 
among Cohort 2 that received lyophilized formulation of the study vaccine. 
All pregnant study participants delivered healthy babies with the exception of one participant, who 
experienced a stillbirth at an estimated 37 week gestation based on her last menstrual period. According 
to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, the annual infant death rate in DRC is 
65 infant deaths per 1,000 live births based on estimates from 2017. This rate is likely higher in the 
Tshuapa Province compared to the national average given that this is one of the poorest provinces in DRC 
and access to quality medical care and prenatal care in particular is extremely limited. For this reason, 
the occurrence of a stillbirth was not unexpected for this population and is not believed to be related to 
the study vaccine. 
PHE surveillance study in UK 
The study was planned to recruit 120 participants. To MAH’s latest information, 89 participants received 
IMVANEX in total. No SAEs pertaining to this study were received from health authorities (as of last PSUR 
DLP which as 31-Jan-2022). 
Final data on non-serious AE from this study is not yet available to the MAH, as no CSR has been received 
yet. 
2.3.3.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile of IMVANEX has been well characterized in clinical trials involving in total >10,700 
subjects to date, including both liquid frozen and freeze-dried formulations, and supported by routine 
PSURs in 6-monthly intervals. 
Very commonly reported AEs in the currently approved liquid frozen formulation (according to section 4.8 
of the SmPC) are local and systemic reactions, such as injection site pain, erythema, swelling, induration 
and pruritus, or headache, fatigue, myalgia and nausea. 
Safety information is provided specifically for the two clinical studies mentioned in the efficacy section 
above. 
In the CDC monkeypox cohort study, the most frequently reported AEs were local vaccination site 
reactions with frequencies up to 37% (injection site pain in vaccinia naïve participants) and general, 
systemic symptoms with frequencies up to 18% (headache in vaccinia naïve participants). These 
frequencies are well in line or even below those reported in the previous cumulative experience with 
IMVANEX. 
As of 6 July 2021, there have not been SAEs that have been determined to be related to study vaccine 
nor meeting the requirements (i.e., serious, unexpected, suspected adverse reaction) for the submission 
of IND safety reports, according to the MAH. A total of 16 deaths assessed as unrelated by the local study 
physician were reported in the CDC study. Four of them were neurovascular or thrombotic/ 
thromboembotic events, including stroke in the context of acquired immunodeficiency (HIV/AIDS); 
hypertensive cardiopathy; cerebral vascular accident secondary to hypertension; cerebral vascular 
accident secondary to HIV infection and cryptococcal meningitis. For the case of cerebral vascular 
secondary to HIV infection and cryptococcal meningitis, it occurred 52 days after the second vaccination, 
Assessment report  
EMA/683534/2022 
Page 34/42 
 
 
 
 
which does not appear to point to a temporal relationship. Considering the presence of HIV infection and 
cryptococcal meningitis diagnosis, it can be agreed that death of this patient is unrelated to IMVANEX 
vaccine. For the reminding three cases of death, very limited information available makes it very 
challenging to conduct a causality assessment. The MAH committed to provide the follow-up information 
to the EMA upon availability.  
In addition, in the CDC study, there was one suspect myocardial infarction assessed as unrelated by the 
local study physician. Very limited information is included in the submitted case narrative, precluding 
causality assessment. The MAH committed to consolidate, and update all follow up information and 
include it in the next PSUR (DLP 31-Jul-2022).  
In the CDC study, 14 female study participants became pregnant within 6 months of receiving the study 
vaccine, and one out of them experienced a stillbirth at an estimated 37-week gestation. The occurrence 
of a stillbirth was not unexpected for this population and is unlikely to be related to the study vaccine, 
when taking into account the reported country-specific background infant death rate in DRC. 
In the PHE surveillance study in UK, no SAEs pertaining to this study were received by the MAH. 
Taken together, there are no important identified risks to date based on the currently available database. 
However, the size of database is not sufficient to characterise very rare adverse events. As per Risk 
Management Plan version 8.0 (approved on 02 September 2021 in the EU), there are no important 
identified risks; important potential risks are myo-/pericarditis and postvaccinal encephalitis. 
2.3.3.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The reactogenicity and safety of IMVANEX has been characterised in clinical trials included in the existing 
clinical dossier. 
Safety data from the CDC and the UK cohort studies did not raise safety signal of major concern.  
2.3.4.  PSUR cycle 
Based on the current circumstances with the monkeypox outbreak, the CHMP is of the opinion that the 
already existing entry in the EURD list for smallpox and monkeypox vaccine (live modified vaccinia virus 
Ankara) needs to be amended as follows: the PSUR cycle for the medicinal product should follow a half-
yearly cycle. The next data lock point will be 31-Jul-2022.  
2.4.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version 9.0 with this application.  
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted RMP: 
The PRAC considered that the RMP version 9.0 is not acceptable and requested the MAH to submit and 
updated RMP within 2 months of the conclusion of this variation. RMP version 8.0 remains as the latest 
approved. 
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes.  
2.5.  Update of the Product information 
The CHMP adopted a new indication (section 4.1) as follows: 
Assessment report  
EMA/683534/2022 
Page 35/42 
 
 
 
 
“Active immunisation against smallpox, monkeypox and disease caused by vaccinia virus in adults 
(see sections 4.4 and 5.1) 
The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations.”  
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.6 and 5.1 of the SmPC have also been 
updated. The Package Leaflet and Labelling are updated in accordance. 
Annex II is updated to refer to the newly imposed post-authorisation efficacy study as a specific 
obligation.  
Please refer to Attachment 1 which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information. 
2.5.1.  User consultation 
No justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH. However, the changes to the package leaflet do not require user 
consultation with target patient groups. 
2.5.2.  Labelling and package leaflet exemptions 
A request of translation exemption of the labelling as per Art.63.1 of Directive 2001/83/EC has been 
submitted by the MAH proposing that the details listed in Article 54 appear in only one official language 
English (EN) on all packaging components (vial and outer carton), as well as EN package leaflet. The 
main grounds of the justification were that IMVANEX doses are potentially used for stockpiling, 
vaccinating laboratory, healthcare workers, military forces and in case of any monkeypox outbreak, and 
the fact that the medicinal product will not be delivered directly to the patient for self-administration but 
by a healthcare professional. 
a) Outer and immediate labelling in English only 
The QRD* Group has temporarily accepted the proposed labelling exemption to provide outer and 
immediate packaging in EN as per art 63(3) for one year, until the end of July 2023. 
*Germany would accept English only vial label but request a multilingual outer carton. 
b) Printed package leaflet in English only  
The QRD* Group has temporarily accepted the proposed labelling exemption to provide printed package 
leaflet in English only within the outer carton as per art 63(3) for one year, until the end of July 2023. 
However, the MAH shall provide printed package leaflets in local languages alongside the supplies of the 
vaccine.  
*Germany would require multilingual printed package leaflet to be provided within the outer carton. 
The labelling subject to translation exemption as per the QRD Group decision above will however be 
translated in all languages in the Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website, but the printed 
materials will only be translated in the language(s) as agreed by the QRD Group. 
In addition, the Applicant has requested an exemption for omission to include any blue box information 
on the outer carton for unlimited period of time. The main grounds of the justification were: IMVANEX 
doses used for stockpiling or in case of emergency outbreak situations, therefore, unpredictable orders 
from each MS. Moreover, this exemption was justified on the deep-frozen storage/shipping requirements 
Assessment report  
EMA/683534/2022 
Page 36/42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and the necessity to label batches ahead of time before allocation to specific countries. One batch will be 
delivered to several countries. 
c) Request to omit Blue Box 
The QRD Group* has temporarily accepted the proposed labelling exemption for the omission of blue box 
information for Imvanex for one year, until the end of July 2023. 
*Germany has not accepted this translation exemption and would require the blue box information to be 
displayed on the carton. 
*For Denmark, the omission of the blue box on the outer pack would be acceptable. However, the blue 
box information “Nordic v.nr.” is needed e.g., as a sticker on the box. 
The MAH shall contact separately the Croatian, Slovenian and Slovak national authority to formalise the 
above outcome. 
2.5.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Imvanex (smallpox and monkeypox vaccine 
(live modified vaccinia virus Ankara)) is included in the additional monitoring list as it is approved under 
exceptional circumstances.  
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
After smallpox has been eradicated, monkeypox has become the most significant orthopoxvirus that 
causes infection and disease in humans. The clinical course of monkeypox is similar to smallpox, although 
milder and with a significantly lower case fatality rate. Monkeypox is endemic in tropical rainforests of 
Western and Central Africa with a yet unknown host species. Human-to-animal contact is suspected to be 
a source of human infections in endemic Western and Central African countries. In 2020, more than 
6,000 cases of human monkeypox, with >200 deaths, have been reported in the DRC. 
Most recently, a multi-country monkeypox outbreak is spreading to previously non-endemic countries, 
mostly in the European region. According to the WHO situation report on Monkeypox on 7 July 2022, 
6,027 laboratory-confirmed cases of monkeypox and 3 deaths have been reported to the WHO from 59 
countries from the period of 1 January 2022 to 4 July 2022. Approximately 82% of the cases are in 
Europe, and 15% in the Americas, including more than 1000 confirmed cases in UK (1,351), Spain 
(1,256) and Germany (1,242), and 300 or more confirmed cases in Canada (300) and the United States 
(460). Based on the gender data available on 4,406 cases, men made up 99.5% of the cases, and men 
aged 18 to 44 years accounted for 79% of the cases.  
Other related orthopoxviruses that are known to cause human infection and disease include cowpox and 
replicating vaccinia virus strains. The orthopoxviruses as such are generally less virulent, relative to 
Assessment report  
EMA/683534/2022 
Page 37/42 
 
 
 
 
 
smallpox and monkeypox viruses, and disease (pox lesions) caused by such orthopoxviruses may be less 
frequent and shows fewer spread across the body. Of note, human cowpox and vaccinia infection and 
disease is generally associated with occupational risk and thereby only rare or sporadic events. Occurring 
of such events is primarily among the laboratory personnel who works with cowpox or vaccinia virus, and 
those healthcare personnel who administer replicating smallpox (vaccinia) vaccine or care for patients 
infected with such orthopoxviruses. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
In the EU, there is no vaccine specifically licensed for active immunisation for prevention of 
orthopoxviruses other than smallpox. IMVANEX was approved in 2013 in the EU for prevention of 
smallpox in adults.  
In relation to specific treatment, tecovirimat the only medicinal product currently approved in the 
European Union for the treatment of smallpox, monkeypox and cowpox in adults and children with body 
weight at least 13 kg. Tecovirimat is inhibitor of a viral protein relevant for release of virus particles from 
host cells and has recently been approved in the EU for the treatment of smallpox, monkeypox and 
cowpox. It has been authorised based on testing in animal models using other orthopoxviruses than 
smallpox only. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
No new clinical trials sponsored by the MAH have been submitted. 
The MAH provided key results of animal efficacy studies already included in initial MAA dossier and two 
additional confirmatory NHP challenge studies, along with relevant but limited information derived from 
two clinical cohort studies sponsored by US CDC (completed) or by UK (ongoing), to support IMVANEX 
use in monkeypox indication. 
The MAH summarized results of a pivotal phase 3 clinical trial (POX-MVA-006), coupled with animal 
efficacy data, to support the extension of indication to related orthopoxviruses. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
IMVANEX has shown pronounced protective effect consistently in a variety of animal challenge models 
using the intravenous, intratracheal and aerosol routes of administration of monkeypox virus in NHPs, as 
well as the intranasal route in prairie dogs. Dose-dependent efficacy, i.e., 60-100% against lethal 
challenge with monkeypox virus, was observed, following two subcutaneous injections of the vaccine 4-
week apart, at doses ranging from 1x106 to 1x108 TCID50 in NHPs. Whenever measured in the protected 
animals that were vaccinated with IMVANEX, anti-vaccinia humoral and cellular immune responses, 
including binding and neutralising antibodies in the blood of the vaccinated animals, could be evidenced. 
Interestingly, single vaccination with 1x108 TCID50 of IMVANEX also conferred 88-100% protection of 
monkeypox in NHPs in the intravenous and intratracheal route challenge models, which is relevant for 
emergency settings. 
Beyond key animal data, limited information is available. No cases of monkeypox disease were reported 
in approximately 1600 healthy adults that live in a geographic region where monkeypox is endemic after 
they had received a primary series of IMVANEX and followed for up to 2 years period post vaccination. 
This CDC-sponsored study was uncontrolled and without a formal statistical testing for efficacy. Very 
preliminary data were also derived from UK surveillance study that reported 1 case of monkeypox among 
89 subjects who received post-exposure prophylaxis with IMVANEX. 
Assessment report  
EMA/683534/2022 
Page 38/42 
 
 
 
 
The CDC-sponsored cohort study produced preliminary immunogenicity data as regards IMVANEX-induced 
antibody response, including monkeypox-neutralising antibodies in 73 IMVANEX recipients (30 vaccinia-
naïve, 43 vaccinia-experienced). The results of monkeypox-specific PRNT response were similar to the 
previous experience with vaccinia specific PRNT. The durability of monkeypox-neutralization response was 
also similar to the vaccinia one, with responses declining but still detectable up to year 2 post vaccination 
in vaccinia-experienced subjects. 
Concerning prophylaxis use of IMVANEX to prevent vaccinia virus disease, the data provided was linked to 
clinical trial POX-MVA-006, where an efficacy of 97.9% (95% CI: 96.6%, 98.3%) in preventing the 
growth of replicating vaccinia virus of ACAM2000 vaccine (a derivative of NYCBH strain) was 
demonstrated in healthy vaccinia-naïve adults when vaccination with IMVANEX (1x108 TCID50/SC, 28 
days apart) was implemented ahead of scarification with ACAM2000 (2.5-12.5x105 pfu/scarification) in 
study participants. In addition, this study demonstrated that two doses of IMVANEX was at least as 
immunogenic as single dose (2.5-12.5x105 pfu/scarification) of ACAM2000 replicating vaccinia vaccine, at 
peak response visit. Vaccinia-specific PRNT titre (WR-VV strain) in IMVANEX recipients was 153.5 
(95%CI: 134.3; 175.6) 2-week post dose 2 in the per-protocol population (N=185), whereas it was 79.3 
(95%CI: 67.1, 93.8) in ACAM2000 vaccine recipients in the per-protocol population (N=186). Also of 
interest is that a single dose of IMVANEX induced comparable vaccinia-neutralising antibody response, as 
did ACAM2000, at 2-week time point, a time when replicating smallpox vaccines are considered protective 
based on the traditional readout of take formation. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
No clinical efficacy trial or effectiveness study in the field that would allow to generate confirmatory data 
has been conducted with IMVANEX. The submitted 2 cohort studies suffer from serious limitations in 
study designs, including use of single-arm and historical control, lack of a formal statistical testing for 
efficacy, etc. The very limited immunogenicity data on monkeypox-neutralising antibody derived from 
CDC study is hard to interpret, due to the non-validated analytic method, and also the fact of gap of 
knowledge about an immune correlate of protection against monkeypox. 
Furthermore, a direct translation of animal efficacy data to humans carries an obvious uncertainty. 
Therefore, although protection against disease in humans is expected, it is still unknown whether 
IMVANEX prophylactic use can confer reasonable level of protection in humans under the conditions of 
natural monkeypox disease transmission. The activity of current monkeypox outbreak makes it likely that 
it is feasible to perform an effectiveness study with IMVANEX so as to generate confirmatory data. Hence, 
the CHMP has added a new specific obligation within this extension of indication application with the 
request for a PAES to be conducted. The MAH proposed a prospective non-interventional multicentre 
cohort study to investigate safety and effectiveness of IMVANEX against monkeypox. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of IMVANEX has been well characterized in clinical trials involving in total >10,700 
subjects to date, including both liquid frozen and freeze-dried formulations, and supported by routine 
PSURs in 6-monthly intervals. 
Very commonly reported AEs in the currently approved liquid frozen formulation (according to section 4.8 
of the SmPC) are local and systemic reactions, such as injection site pain, erythema, swelling, induration 
and pruritus, or headache, fatigue, myalgia and nausea. 
In the CDC monkeypox cohort study provided in this application, the most frequently reported adverse 
events were local vaccination site reactions with frequencies up to 37% (injection site pain in vaccinia 
Assessment report  
EMA/683534/2022 
Page 39/42 
 
 
 
 
naïve participants) and general, systemic symptoms with frequencies up to 18% (headache in vaccinia 
naïve participants). These frequencies are well in line or even below those reported in the previous 
cumulative experience with IMVANEX. 
As of 6 July 2021, there have not been SAEs that have been determined to be related to study vaccine 
nor meeting the requirements (i.e., serious, unexpected, suspected adverse reaction) for the submission 
of IND safety reports, according to the MAH. 
In the PHE surveillance study in UK, no SAEs pertaining to this study were received by the MAH. 
Taken together, there are no important identified risks to date, based on the existing database. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
In the CDC monkeypox cohort study, 16 deaths were reported as of 6 July 2021, and were assessed as 
unrelated by the local study physicians. Four of them were neurovascular or thrombotic/thromboembotic 
events, including stroke in the context of acquired immunodeficiency (HIV/AIDS); hypertensive 
cardiopathy; cerebral vascular accident secondary to hypertension; cerebral vascular accident secondary 
to HIV infection and cryptococcal meningitis. Very limited information was available for the first three 
cases of deaths. 
In the CDC study, there was one suspect myocardial infarction. Only limited information was available.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Considering the conduct of human efficacy clinical trials against monkeypox is infeasible. Animal efficacy 
data regarding prevention of monkeypox generated from different NHP challenge models are considered 
most pertinent to inferring efficacy of IMVANEX against monkeypox in humans. The cross-neutralization 
data generated from clinical trials (WR-VV, IHD-J, ACAM2000 vaccine strain, derivative of NYCBH strain) 
and cross-protectivity from mice (WR-VV, Ectromelia, monkeypox) are also relevant to monkeypox 
indication. 
Clinical efficacy of IMVANEX in preventing growth of replicating vaccinia virus is most relevant to 
supporting IMVANEX prophylaxis use in preventing vaccinia disease. 
Regarding unfavourable effects, IMVANEX is found well-tolerated in healthy adults, with mild to moderate 
and transient local and systemic reactions, including injection site pain, erythema, swelling, induration 
and pruritus, or headache, fatigue, myalgia and nausea. With a size of total >10,700 subjects to date, 
from clinical trials, the safety profile of IMVANEX remains to be favorable. There are no important 
identified risks. Provided information from the CDC study and UK surveillance project do not raise safety 
signals of major concern. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Taking into account the favourable safety profile, with only mild to moderate and transient adverse 
events, and the consistent signs towards protective efficacy based on animal challenge models and 
Assessment report

corresponding human immunogenicity data, the benefit risk profile of IMVANEX for prevention of 
monkeypox and disease caused by vaccinia virus, is considered favourable. 
Therefore, approval of IMVANEX extension of indication to monkeypox and disease caused by vaccinia 
virus is recommended. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit risk balance of IMVANEX is positive.

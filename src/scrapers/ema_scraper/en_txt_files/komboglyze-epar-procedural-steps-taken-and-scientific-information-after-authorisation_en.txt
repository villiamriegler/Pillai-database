are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

consequence, the RMP (Onglyza: version 12, 
Komboglyze: version 13) is updated accordingly. In 
addition, routine changes are made in parts III 
(pharmacovigilance plan, overview of planned 
pharmacovigilance actions) and IV. A safety review 
based on literature has also been included to 
investigate acute kidney injury associated with 
saxagliptin/saxagliptin and metformin at the PRAC

Please refer to the assessment report:  
726/2004, the European Commission requested on 
25 January 2016 the opinion of the European 
Medicines Agency on the adequacy of the current 
recommendations for metformin containing products 
with respect to the use in patients with moderate 
renal failure, taking into account the available 
information on the risk of lactic acidosis. The CHMP 
was requested to assess the impact thereof on the

Regarding the use of Komboglyze and Onglyza in older 
following a worksharing procedure according to 
Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
1234/2008. 
Update of sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8 and 5.1 of the 
SmPC with regard to posology recommendations and 
warnings for use in elderly patients and patients with 
patients, no dose adjustment is recommended based solely 
on age.  
No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild 
renal impairment. The dose should be reduced to 2.5 mg 
once daily in patients with moderate or severe renal 
impairment. Onglyza is not recommended for patients with 
end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring haemodialysis.

renal impairment, minor amendment of the existing 
warning on skin disorders, lack of inhibition of 
CYP2C8 by saxagliptin and inclusion of safety and 
efficacy information from study D1680C00003 
(SAVOR), a cardiovascular outcome study, and study 
D1680L00002 (GENERATION), a study comparing 
saxagliptin with glimepiride in elderly patients. 
Furthermore, the MAH took the opportunity to 
implement QRD version 9 for Komboglyze and to 
update the list of local representatives and to 
perform minor editorial corrections throughout both 
PIs.

Experience in NYHA class III-IV of heart failure is still 
limited. Therefore, caution is warranted in these patients. 
In the SAVOR trial a small increase in the rate for 
hospitalisation for heart failure was observed in the 
saxagliptin treated patients compared to placebo (see 
section 5.1). Additional analysis did not indicate a 
differential effect among NYHA classes. 
In in vitro studies, saxagliptin and its major metabolite did 
not inhibit CYP2C8. 
SAVOR was a cardiovascular outcome study conducted in 
16,492 patients with type II diabetes who had a history of, 
or were at risk for, cardiovascular events. Its results 
demonstrated that saxagliptin is non-inferior to placebo and 
does not induce an increased risk for cardiovascular death, 
non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal ischaemic 
stroke. 
GENERATION was a 52-week trial performed in 720 elderly 
patients. The purpose was to evaluate whether saxagliptin 
+ Metformin was superior to glimepiride + metformin on 
the primary endpoint of subjects reaching HbA1c < 7% 
without hypoglycaemia (confirmed or severe). There 
appeared to be no difference in responders. Glimepiride 
was more effective than saxagliptin in reducing HbA1c, but 
at the cost of more hypoglycaemia. Saxagliptin was less 
effective, but can still reduce HbA1c to some extent, and 
did not induce hypoglycaemia. Age appeared to be an 
important factor: results favoured saxagliptin in subjects < 
75, and glimepiride in subjects > 75 years.

regarding the use of the sofosbuvir-containing 
products in patients with renal impairment, based on 
final results from studies GS-US-342-4062, GS-US-
337-4063 and GS-US-334-0154, listed as a category 
3 study in the RMP and study GS-US-338-1125. 
Study GS-US-342-4062 was a phase 2, multi-centre, 
open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety 
of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 Weeks in subjects 
with chronic HCV infection who are on dialysis for 
administered for 12 weeks to 18 patients with genotype 1 
chronic hepatitis C and severe renal impairment in an 
open-label study (Study 0154). The safety of sofosbuvir in 
a fixed dose combination with either ledipasvir or 
velpatasvir has been studied in 154 patients with ESRD 
requiring dialysis (Study 4062 and Study 4063). In this 
setting, exposure of sofosbuvir metabolite GS-331007 is 
20-fold increased, exceeding levels where adverse 
reactions have been observed in preclinical trials. In this 
limited clinical safety data set, the rate of adverse events 
and deaths was not clearly elevated from what is expected 
in ESRD patients. 
The CHMP considered that safety data on the use of the 
sofosbuvir-based products in patients with severe renal 
impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] <

relevant treatment options are available.

Study GS-US-338-1125 was a phase 1, open-label,

Update of sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC in order 
implement new information on the use of sofosbuvir-
based therapy with concomitant drugs, based on 
final results from study GS-US-334-2130. This was a 
phase I study to evaluate the effects of cytochrome

and probe drug pharmacokinetics in healthy 
subjects.  Furthermore, section 4.3 of the Sovaldi 
SmPC was updated in order to remove the use of 
rifabutin as a contraindication. 
The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. In

opportunity to introduce minor editorial changes 
throughout the Product Information. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
rifabutin and carbamazepine administration on the drug 
levels of sofosbuvir have been updated throughout the 
Product Information.  
With regards to the rifabutin interaction, a 28% reduction 
in sofosbuvir exposure was observed. Considering that 
reduction in sofosbuvir dose of <50% is expected to be 
safe in terms of potentially reduced efficacy, the CHMP 
concluded that the data support removal of co-
administration of rifabutin as contraindication from the 
Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) Product Information. The 
contraindication is maintained for Epclusa, Harvoni and 
Vosevi, given the lack of data on interactions with the other 
active substances contained in these combination products. 
The data available for interactions with carbamazepine 
indicated that sofosbuvir levels were reduced by 48%, but 
the confidence interval included the 50% value. Therefore, 
the CHMP considered that a cautionary approach should be 
taken and contraindication concerning co-administration of 
carbamazepine should be retained. 
Furthermore, the term “potent P-glycoprotein inducers” 
was replaced by “strong P-glycoprotein inducers” 
throughout the Product Information in line with terminology

mild or moderate renal impairment.  In patients with 
severe renal impairment and end stage renal disease 
(ESRD) there is a moderate increase of sofosbuvir and 
ledipasvir exposure, and a profound increase in the 
exposure of the main sofosbuvir metabolite. The safety 
impact of these increases is uncertain. The safety of 
Harvoni has been assessed in a very limited number of 
patients with severe renal impairment. For patients with 
end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis there is 
only scarce data from published case series.  Harvoni 
should only be considered for patients with severe renal 
impairment/ESRD if no alternative regimens, recommended 
for this treatment population, can be used for reasons such 
as concomitant decompensated cirrhosis, or drug 
interactions that cannot be otherwise handled. When 
Harvoni is used in patients with severe renal impairment or 
ESRD, close monitoring of renal function is recommended.

evaluating efficacy and safety of Harvoni + ribavirin in 
subjects infected with chronic hepatitis C (HCV) who have 
advanced liver disease, the CHMP concluded that in 
situations where the dose of ribavirin is low due to 
tolerability reasons, a prolonged treatment (24 weeks) with 
Harvoni + ribavirin should be considered to minimise the 
risk of relapse. 
Furthermore, in genotype 3 infection, the use of Harvoni 
(always in combination with ribavirin) should only be 
considered for patients who are deemed at high risk of 
clinical disease progression and who do not have 
alternative treatment options.

In this application the MAH presented data from 4 studies 
order to include data on the treatment of non-
genotype 1 HCV-infected subjects. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
where patients with genotype 2-, 4-, 5- and 6- hepatitis C-
infection were treated with sofosbuvir/ledipasvir (without 
ribavirin) for a duration of 12 weeks. All studies were of 
limited size with low number of cirrhotic patients. Sustained 
virologic response at 12 weeks following completion of all 
treatment (SVR12) was achieved by >90% of the patients 
across the studies.  
When bridging efficacy from such limited studies to large 
scales studies performed in genotype-1 infected patients, 
both subtypes (within the different genotypes) and 
naturally occurring polymorphisms with potential impact on 
ledipasvir susceptibility (sofosbuvir being convincingly 
pangenotypic) must be taken into account.  
For genotype 2, there is presently not enough data to 
support a general recommendation of Harvoni for the 
treatment of chronic HCV infection caused by this 
genotype. Specifically, there is not enough data to support 
that sofosbuvir/ledipasvir (without ribaivirin) is an 
optimized regimen regardless of the naturally occurring 
Page 27/35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
NS5A polymorphism L31M. That polymorphism, which 
substantially lowers the in vitro susceptibility to ledipasvir, 
is seen in a round 50% of genotype 2 isolates from 
untreated patients.  
For genotype 4, in vitro data for ledipasvir and clinical data 
for the combination were presented for a high variety of 
genotype 4 subtypes. The issue of naturally occurring 
polymorphisms were also taken into account.  This data 
support the use of sofosbuvir/ledipasvir also in less 
frequently studied genotype 4 subtypes (outside 4a and d, 
such as 4r). Specific patterns of multiple polymorphisms, 
seen very unfrequently, rather than subtype were 
associated with lowered in vitro susceptibility with 
consequent potential loss of efficacy.    
For genotype-5 infection, the limited clinical data in 
combination with the high in vitro susceptibility for 
ledipasvir (as well as sofosbuvir) justifies an extrapolation 
of results obtained in genotype-1 infected patients and to 
include treatment recommendation and duration in section 
4.2.  
For genotype 6, data from genotype 6a and 6e had been 
presented at the time of approval, where the ledipasvir 
susceptibility is considerably lower for 6e than for 6a. As 
part of this application, extensive in vitro data for other 
rare subtypes was presented, where the in vitro 
susceptibility to ledipasvir were lower than that seen for 
subtype 6a, in line with that for 6e. However, 
sofosbuvir/ledipasvir given for 12 weeks (without ribavirin) 
yielded the same very high cure rates in patients infected 
with such subtypes. Although numbers are limited, the data 
are considered as convincing evidence to include treatment 
recommendation and duration in section 4.2, in light of the

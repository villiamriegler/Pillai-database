2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
The sought extension of indication is: “Retsevmo as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adults 
with advanced RET fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)”.  
Epidemiology  
Lung cancer is the second most diagnosed cancer and the most common cause of death due to cancer 
with  approximately  2.2  million  new  cases  and  1.8  million  deaths  in  2020  (Sung  H  et  al,  2021). 
Approximately 80% to 90% of lung cancers are NSCLC (Perez-Moreno et al. 2012; ESMO 2019). 
Approximately 75% of lung adenocarcinomas harbour genetic alterations that promote the RTK/RAS/RAF 
signalling pathway including drivers such as KRAS, EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, MET, NTRK, and RET, among 
others (Inamura, 2017; Rosell and Karachaliou, 2016). 
RET fusions are present in 1% to 2% of NSCLC patients of both Asian and European descent (Kohno et 
al.  2013;  Ferrara  et  al.  2018)  and  the  RET  fusions  are  typically  found  in  adenocarcinoma  histology, 
though occasionally also in squamous cell carcinoma (Lin et al, 2015; Takeuchi et al, 2019). 
Biologic features 
RET is a receptor tyrosine kinase that normally requires ligand and co-receptor binding for activation. 
Genetic alterations in the RET gene have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several human cancers. 
RET  can  become  oncogenically  activated  through  two  primary  mechanisms:  1)  chromosomal 
rearrangements  that  fuse  the  RET  kinase  domain  with  a  partner  protein  dimerization  domain  (e.g., 
Coiled-coil  domain-containing  protein  6  (CCDC6)/papillary  thyroid  cancer-1  (PTC1),  Kinesin  Family 
Member  5B  (KIF5B),  NCOA4/PTC3),  producing  hybrid  proteins  that  endow  the  kinase  with  ligand-
independent, constitutive activity; and 2) point mutations that directly or indirectly activate the kinase 
(Drilon  et  al.  2018).  Both  mechanisms  of  oncogenic  activation  result  in  constitutively  active,  ligand-
independent RET kinase activity and activation of downstream signalling pathways (Drilon et al, 2018). 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Most patients with NSCLC present with metastatic or advanced stage, unresectable disease, and poor 
prognosis, with a 5-year survival rate of 6% for patients diagnosed with distant disease (ESMO 2019; 
ACS  2020).  In  addition,  the  symptoms  associated  with  advanced  and  metastatic  NSCLC  represent  a 
significant burden to patients and include dyspnea, cough, fatigue, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and 
pain.  
Patients with RET fusion-positive lung cancer commonly have brain metastases at rates similar to the 
overall NSCLC population, in approximately 20% to 50% of patients (Fenske et al. 2017; Drilon et al. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/583379/2022  
Page 9/80 
 
 
 
 
2018).  RET  fusion-positive  lung  cancer  is  associated  with  identifiable  clinicopathologic  characteristics 
including  younger  age,  never-smoker  status,  with  relatively  equal  sex  distribution,  early  lymph  node 
metastases, and a solid predominant subtype. RET rearrangement seems to be mutually exclusive with 
other driver alterations (e.g., EGFR, ROS1, KRAS) (Wang et al. 2012). 
For NSCLCs, including lung adenocarcinomas, no significant difference has been reported in progression 
-  free  survival  (PFS)  or  overall  survival  (OS)  between  untreated  patients  with  RET-positive  and  RET-
negative tumours (Wang et al, 2012). 
Management 
RET  fusion-positive  NSCLC  patients  are  treated  with  non-targeted  first-line  treatment  options,  which 
consist of platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, alone or in combination with an immune checkpoint 
inhibitor.  Currently  recommended  subsequent  therapies  after  progression  on  platinum  doublet-based 
therapy consist generally of immune checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy, single agent chemotherapy, or 
docetaxel in combination with ramucirumab (Planchard et al, 2018).  
Vandetanib  and  cabozantinib  are  included  in  the  NCCN  guidelines  as  a  possible  treatment  option  in 
certain circumstances (NCCN 2021) but have not received regulatory approval for the indication of RET 
fusion-positive NSCLC. 
In  18  Nov  2021,  Gavreto  (Pralsetinib)  a  selective  RET  inhibitor  targeting  aberrant  signaling  resulting 
from  oncogenic  RET  alterations,  was  approved  in  Europe  for  the  treatment  of  advanced  RET  fusion-
positive NSCLC based on data from a Phase I/II study (ARROW study). 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Selpercatinib is an inhibitor of the rearranged during transfection (RET) receptor tyrosine kinase. 
RETSEVMO (Selpercatinib) was granted  a CMA on 11 Feb 2021 for 1) the treatment of metastatic RET 
fusion-positive  NSCLC  in  adult  patients  who  require  systemic  therapy  following  prior  treatment  with 
immunotherapy and/or platinum-based chemotherapy, 2) RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer who require 
systemic therapy following prior treatment with sorafenib and/or lenvatinib and 3) RET-mutant MTC in 
adult  and  pediatric  patients  12  years  of  age  and  older  who  require  systemic  therapy  following  prior 
treatment with cabozantinib and/or vandetanib. 
The conditional MA was approved based on  ORR  and  DOR  observed in the  ongoing Phase  1/2 study, 
LIBRETTO-001. 
The presence of a RET gene fusion (NSCLC and non-medullary thyroid cancer) or mutation (MTC) should 
be confirmed by a validated test prior to initiation of treatment with Retsevmo. 
The recommended dose of Retsevmo based on body weight is: 
-Less than 50 kg: 120 mg twice daily. 
-50 kg or greater: 160 mg twice daily. 
If  a  patient  vomits  or  misses  a  dose,  the  patient  should  be  instructed  to  take  the  next  dose  at  its 
scheduled time; an additional dose should not be taken.  
Treatment should be continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
The MAH is seeking an extension of indication of selpercatinib for the first line treatment of advanced 
RET fusion-positive NSCLC.

2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
Selpercatinib is currently being investigated in the Phase 1/2 study, LIBRETTO-001 (LOXO-RET-17001). 
It is a multicenter, single-arm, multicohort, open-label, dose-escalation study in  patients 12 years or 
older with advanced solid tumours, including RET fusion-positive solid tumours, RET-mutant MTC, and 
other tumours with RET activation. 
LIBRETTO-001 was initiated in May 2017. The Phase 1 portion of the study has been completed, and the 
Phase 2 portion is ongoing.   
Data at the DCO date of 15 June 2021 are submitted to support the use of selpercatinib for the treatment 
of RET fusion positive advanced NSCLC in the first line. The exploratory objectives are not presented at 
the DCO.  
The  table  below  summarises  relevant  CHMP  interactions  for  Retsevmo  for  the  first-line  RET  fusion-
positive NSCLC indication. 
Table 1: Selpercatinib - Key Regulatory Interactions in the EU 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The  MAH  stated  that  the  clinical  trial  LOXO-RET-17001  that  support  the  proposed  indication  of 
selpercatinib was conducted in accordance with consensus ethics principles derived from international 
ethics  guidelines,  including  the  Declaration  of  Helsinki  and  Council  for  International  Organizations  of 
Medical  Sciences  (CIOMS),  International  Ethical  Guidelines  for  Biomedical  Research  Involving  Human 
Subjects,  and  the  International  Conference  on  Harmonisation  (ICH)  Good  Clinical  Practices  (GCP) 
Guideline (E6). 
The  clinical  trial  LOXO-RET-17001  (LIBRETTO-001)  conducted  outside  the  European  Union  meets  the 
ethical requirements of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Study  LOXO-RET-17001  was  subject  to  independent  audit  by  regulatory  authorities.  The  audits 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

performed as of 15 June 2021 were: 
Table 2. Audits performed for Study LOXO-RET-17001 as of 15 June 2021  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
Environmental risk assessment 
The Phase I ERA provided by the MAH contained no new data compared to the one submitted with the 
initial MAA. The justification from the MAH for not providing a new ERA was the following: “The 
calculated prevalence in the variation is the same as that calculated in the original Phase I ERA, 
therefore, the concentration of selpercatinib in surface water is the same as in the original MAA and 
the conclusion of lack of risk to the environment is the same”.   
The PEC calculated from prevalence data in Italy (showing the highest prevalence in Europe) is less than 
10 ng/L. The Kow is less than 4.5. No phase II studies have been conducted. The product is considered 
to have a low risk to the environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Selpercatinib  is  an  orally  available,  highly  selective,  adenosine  triphosphate  (ATP)-competitive  small 
molecule inhibitor of the RET receptor tyrosine kinase.  
In  Europe,  selpercatinib  is  approved  under  the  brand  name  of  Retsevmo®.  Two  strengths  of  hard 
capsules, 40 and 80 mg are available. Selpercatinib is actually used as monotherapy for the treatment 
of adults with: 
• 
• 
advanced RET fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who require systemic therapy 
following prior treatment with immunotherapy and/or platinum-based chemotherapy  
advanced  RET  fusion-positive  thyroid  cancer  who  require  systemic  therapy  following  prior 
treatment with sorafenib and/or lenvatinib  
Selpercatinib is also indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adults and adolescents 12 years and 
older with advanced RET-mutant medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) who require systemic therapy following 
prior treatment with cabozantinib and/or vandetanib. 
Selpercatinib is orally given and the recommended dose is based on body weight:  
• 
Less than 50 kg: 120 mg twice daily.  
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/583379/2022  
Page 13/80 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
50 kg or greater: 160 mg twice daily.  
The pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of selpercatinib were  sufficiently characterized  in the  initial  MAA 
and are summarized below as described in the actual adopted SmpC.  
In the current submission, the applicant seeks a modification of the indication of selpercatinib to include 
the treatment  of  RET  fusion-positive  NSCLC  in  the  first-line  setting  (treatment  of  RET  fusion-positive 
advanced NSCLC regardless of line of therapy).  
There  are  neither  new  PK  data  that  would  change  the  main  PK  features  of  selpercatinib  nor  special 
populations . Also, no revision of section 5.2 PK properties of the SmpC is claimed.  
The PK data provided in support of this submission includes: 
• 
Descriptive,  noncompartmental  methods  of  analysis  of  selpercatinib  PK  data  from  all patients 
enrolled in the pivotal study LOXO-RET-17001 (LIBRETTO-001) as of the submission data cut-
off date (15 June 2021) for whom PK data were not previously reported in the initial MAA. 
The additional PK data from the pivotal study LOXO-RET-17001 are presented in the paragraph “PK in 
target population”. 
Absorption 
After an oral dose of 160 mg, Retsevmo was rapidly  absorbed, with Tmax of approximately 2 hours. 
Geometric mean absolute oral bioavailability was 73.2% (range: 60.2-81.5%).  
Effect of food  
Compared to selpercatinib AUC and Cmax in the fasted state, selpercatinib AUC was increased by 9% 
and Cmax was reduced by 14% after oral administration of a single 160 mg dose to healthy subjects 
taken  with  a  high-fat  meal.  These  changes  were  not  considered  to  be  clinically  relevant.  Therefore, 
selpercatinib can be taken with or without food. 
Distribution 
Selpercatinib mean (CV%) volume of distribution (Vss/F), estimated by Population PK analysis, is 191 
(69%) L following oral administration of selpercatinib in adult patients. Selpercatinib is 96% bound to 
human  plasma  proteins  in  vitro  and  binding  is  independent  of  concentration.  The  blood-to-plasma 
concentration ratio is 0.7.  
Elimination 
The mean (CV%) clearance (CL/F) of selpercatinib is 6.0 (49%) L/h and the half-life is 22 hours following 
oral  administration  of  selpercatinib  in  adult  patients.  Following  oral  administration  of  a  single  [14C] 
radiolabeled  160  mg  dose  of  selpercatinib  to  healthy  subjects,  69%  (14%  unchanged)  of  the 
administered radioactivity was recovered in faeces and 24% (11.5% unchanged) was recovered in urine. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
The  pharmacokinetics  of  selpercatinib  were  evaluated  in  patients  with  locally  advanced  or  metastatic 
solid tumors administered 160 mg twice daily unless otherwise specified. Steady-state selpercatinib AUC 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/583379/2022  
Page 14/80 
 
 
 
 
and Cmax increased in a linear to supra-dose proportional manner over the dose range of 20 mg once 
daily to 240 mg twice daily.  
Steady-state  was  reached  by  approximately  7  days  and  the  median  accumulation  ratio  after 
administration  of  160  mg  twice  daily  was  3.4-fold.  Mean  steady-state  selpercatinib  [coefficient  of 
variation (CV%)] Cmax was 2,980 (53%) ng/mL and AUC0-24h was 51,600 (58%) ng*h/mL. 
Special populations 
Age, gender and body weight  
Age (range: 15 years to 90 years) or gender had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics 
of Retsevmo. Patients with a body weight ≤50 kg should start Retsevmo treatment with a dose of 120 
mg twice daily, while patients >50 kg should start Retsevmo treatment with a dose of 160 mg twice 
daily.  
Hepatic impairment  
Selpercatinib AUC0-∞ increased by 7% in subjects with mild, 32% in subjects with moderate Child-Pugh 
classification. Thus, selpercatinib exposure (AUC) in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment 
(Child-Pugh class A and B) is comparable  to  exposure  in healthy subjects when a dose  of 160 mg is 
administered.  
Selpercatinib AUC0-∞ increased by 77% in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class 
C). There is limited clinical data on the safety of selpercatinib in patients with severe hepatic impairment. 
Therefore, dose modification is recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment (section 4.2).  
Renal impairment  
In a clinical pharmacology study using single dose selpercatinib 160 mg, exposure (AUC) was unchanged 
in subjects with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment. End stage renal disease (eGFR <15 ml/min) 
and dialysis patients have not been studied. 
Paediatric population  
Based on limited pharmacokinetic data, the Cmax and AUC was similar in adolescent patients, 12-18

The steady-state PK parameters (Tmax, Cmax, and AUC0-24) for patients with evaluable data at Cycle 
1 Day 8 were previously calculated by non-compartmental analyses. The NCA PK parameters for patients 
with NSCLC from data cuts of 09 May 2017 to 30 March 2020 (LOXONCA- LOXO292-1229) and 01 April 
2020 to 10 June 2021(LOXO-NCA-LOXO292-2829) were combined with tumour type data and treatment 
status for the analysis:

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Selpercatinib is an inhibitor of the rearranged during transfection (RET) receptor tyrosine kinase. Certain 
point mutations in RET or chromosomal rearrangements involving in frame fusions of RET with various 
partners  can  result in  constitutively  activated  chimeric  RET  fusion  proteins that  can  act  as  oncogenic 
drivers  by  promoting  cell  proliferation  of  tumour  cell  lines.  In  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  tumour  models, 
selpercatinib demonstrated anti-tumour activity in cells harboring constitutive activation of RET protein 
resulting  from  gene  fusions  and  mutations,  including  CCDC6  RET,  KIF5B  RET,  RET  V804M,  and  RET 
M918T.  In  addition,  selpercatinib  showed  anti-tumour  activity  in  mice  intracranially  implanted  with  a 
patient-derived RET fusion-positive tumour. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
No new data have been submitted as part of this application. 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
No new data have been submitted as part of this application. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
No complementary formal PK investigations have been carried out in the context of the variation under 
review. Additional new PK data from the pivotal study LOXO-RET-17001 (n=32, collected from 01 April 
2020 to 10 June 2021) have been provided and compared to the previous data already submitted in the 
initial  MAA  (n=  614,  collected  from  09  May  2017  to  30  March  2020).  Furthermore,  a  comparison  of 
steady-state  selpercatinib  PK  parameters  in  the  target  NSCLC  patients  treatment-naïve  using  the 
recommended 160 mg BID dose with the reference NSCLC patients who had prior therapy is provided. 
Overall, the PKs of selpercatinib in the target patients was assessed and the updated data identified no 
significant difference compared to other /current NSCLC cancer patients.  
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The applicant applied for an extension of the indication to include adult patients with RET fusion-positive 
NSCLC in the first-line setting (treatment-naïve) in addition to  patients with RET fusion-positive non-
small  cell  lung  cancer  NSCLC  who  had  prior  therapy  (currently  approved).  Overall,  no  significant 
difference in PKs characteristics of selpercatinib is observed in the target patients by comparison to other 
cancer patients already assessed in the already authorised indication. No revision of section 5.2 of the 
SmpC is required. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
Study LIBRETTO-001 is an open-label, multicentre, global Phase 1/2 study of selpercatinib in patients 
with RET-altered advanced solid tumours that was initiated in May 2017. The Phase 1 portion of the 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

study allowed to determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended Phase 2 dose of 
selpercatinib. A dose of 160 mg BID was selected for Phase 2. 
The approved dose as recommended in the SmPC is 160 mg taken orally twice daily (body weight 50 
mg or greater). 
2.4.2.  Main study

Treatments 
The RP2D of selpercatinib (160 mg BID) was selected in Phase 1 and has been used as the starting dose 
for patients in the Phase 2 dose expansion phase of the study. 
Patients continued selpercatinib dosing in 28-day cycles until PD, unacceptable toxicity, or other reason 
for  treatment  discontinuation.  Patients  with  PD  could  continue  selpercatinib  if,  in  the  opinion  of  the 
Investigator, the patient was deriving clinical benefit from continuing study treatment, and continuation 
of treatment was approved by the Sponsor.

Sample size 
Phase 2 
For Cohort 1 (patients with RET fusion-positive solid tumours who have progressed on or are intolerant 
to standard first-line therapy for their cancers), a sample size of 55 patients is estimated to provide 85% 
power to achieve a lower boundary of a two-sided 95% exact binomial confidence interval (CI) about 
the estimated ORR that exceeds 30%.  
For Cohort 2 (patients with RET fusion-positive solid tumours without prior standard first-line therapy), 
a sample size of 59 patients is estimated to provide 85% power to achieve a lower boundary of a two-
sided 95% exact binomial CI about the estimated ORR that exceeds 35%. For Cohort 3 (patients with 
RET-mutant MTC who have progressed on or are intolerant to vandetanib and/or cabozantinib), a sample 
size of 83 patients is estimated to provide 85% power to achieve a lower boundary of a two-sided 95% 
exact binomial CI about the estimated ORR that exceeds 20%.  
For  Cohort  4  (patients  with  RET-mutant  MTC  who  are  MKI-naïve),  a  sample  size  of  55  patients  is 
estimated to provide 85% power to achieve  a lower boundary of  a two-sided 95% exact binomial CI 
about the estimated ORR that exceeds 30%. 
Enrolment  beyond  the  above  sample  sizes  in  each  of  Cohorts  1-5,  will  be  allowed,  in  order  to 
accommodate  enrollment  demand  and  allow  for  the  characterization  of  AEs  that  may  occur  with  low 
frequency. With a sample size of 150 patients, the probability of observing one or more instances of a 
specific AE within a cohort with a true incidence rate of 1% and 2% is 77.9% and 95.2%, respectively. 
The sample size for Cohort 1 was increased to ~250 to accommodate enrollment demand. Additional 
enrollment will also allow for the characterization of AEs that may occur with low frequency which would 
enhance knowledge of the safety profile of selpercatinib. Further, this cohort allows for the enrollment 
of patients with RET fusion-positive solid tumours other than NSCLC. While the enrollment demand for 
patients  with  RET  fusion-positive  NSCLC  has  been  adequate  for  statistical  analysis,  additional  solid 
tumour  types  remain  underrepresented  and  enrollment  expansion  allows  for  data  capture  in  this 
population. 
Up to ~50 patients will be enrolled into Cohort 6 based on clinical consideration. Exploring efficacy in 
patients with a history of prior exposure to RET specific inhibitors may enhance understanding of the 
risk:benefit of additional RET specific therapy in these patients and aid in the consideration of resistance 
mechanisms in response to this type of therapy. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
The study is non-randomized and non-blinded single arm study.  
Statistical methods 
There were no changes in the planned analyses for the study except some with minimal impact which 
are described in the SAP addendum dated 14 June 2021.  
The overall rationale for the RET fusion-positive NSCLC SAP Addendum 1 is to outline the FDA RET fusion-
positive  NSCLC  Accelerated  Approval  Requirement  (AAR)  and  detail  considerations  for  the  sNDA 
submission cutoff date. 
In addition, subgroup analyses are planned for patients with vs without prior immune checkpoint inhibitor 
(ICI) therapy.

Intracranial Analysis 
Time  to  CNS  progression  will  be  explored.  Time  to  CNS  progression  is  defined  as  the  time  from 
randomization until the occurrence of documented CNS progression by the IRC. 
CNS progression, non-CNS progression, and death are competing risk events; CNS progression is the 
event of interest defined as progression due to newly developed intracranial lesions and/or progression 
of pre-existing intracranial lesions per RECIST version 1.1. 
To  account  for  the  competing  risks,  the  probability  of  the  first  event  of  CNS  progression,  non-  CNS 
progression, or death without any progression will be estimated using a cumulative incidence 
function  (sub-distribution  function).  A  plot  of  the  estimated  cumulative-incidence  functions  will  be 
displayed. 
Intra-patient Analysis 
Prior therapy data will be used to perform an exploratory analysis comparing benefit achieved on the 
last  therapy  patients  received  prior  to  the  study  enrollment  to  benefit  achieved  on  selpercatinib 
treatment  using  each  study  patient  as  their  own  control.  A  known  limitation  of  this  analysis  is 
retrospective prior therapy data collection based on patients’ medical records without central review and 
confirmation based on RECIST criteria. 
There is no change to efficacy analysis sets defined in the original version of the NSCLC SCE SAP. 
Patients enrolled into the Phase 1 dose escalation as well as the Phase 1 and Phase 2 dose expansion 
cohorts were grouped to derive the analysis sets. The goal of the arrangement of these various data sets 
was to: 
-maximize  information  through  the  consolidation  of  data  from  both  Phase  1  and  Phase  2  parts  of 
LIBRETTO-001, and. 
-define groupings based on clinically meaningful distinctions, resulting in similarity of patients within a 
group, thus, facilitating the interpretation of results. 
Patients with RET fusion-positive NSCLC who had received at least 1 dose of selpercatinib and achieved 
at least 6 months of potential follow-up time from the first dose of selpercatinib (or disease progression 
or death, whichever occurred first), as of 15 June 2021, were considered eligible for efficacy analyses.  
The evaluation of efficacy consists of RET fusion-positive NSCLC analysis sets as defined in Table 3.2 
(the basis for the initial regulatory submissions) and includes patients enrolled into Cohorts 1, 2, and 5. 
Cohort  6  includes  patients  who  have  received  prior  treatment  with  a  selective  RET  inhibitor  and  are 
therefore  not  included  in  the  efficacy  analysis;  these  patients  were  excluded  in  LIBRETTO-001  until 
Cohort 6 was introduced in Protocol version 8. 
The efficacy analysis for RET fusion-positive NSCLC primarily focused on 1) previously treated patients 
and  2) treatment-naïve patients.  Efficacy  was  further  assessed using  the  supportive  efficacy  analysis 
sets described in Table 3.2, including a CNS Response Analysis Set consisting of all patients with RET 
fusion-positive NSCLC who have investigator-identified CNS metastases at baseline (reported as target 
or nontarget lesion per RECIST v1.1).

Numbers analysed 
At the DCO date, all 355 patients with RET fusion-positive NSCLC from Cohorts 1, 2, and 5 are included 
in the efficacy analysis as they had achieved at least 6 months of potential follow-up time from the first 
dose. 
The primary efficacy analysis set to support the  proposed first-line  indication included  69 Treatment-
Naïve Patients (previously named SAS1);

The main supportive analysis sets include: 
• 
Patients  Previously  Treated  with  Platinum-Based  Chemotherapy  (N=247)  (previously  named 
IAS); 
•  CNS Response Analysis Set (N=106). 
Patients in Cohort 6 (only 1 patient at the DCO), which was introduced in protocol version 8, are not 
included in the evaluation of efficacy as it is a different population of patients who have received prior 
treatment with a selective RET inhibitor.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The  MAH  is  seeking  by  this  application  an  extension  of  indication  of  selpercatinib  for  the  first  line 
treatment of advanced RET fusion-positive NSCLC. Selpercatinib has a conditional approval for previously 
treated advanced RET fusion-positive NSCLC (immunotherapy and/or platinum based chemotherapy). 
In addition, a CMA was granted to thyroid cancer patients following prior treatment with sorafenib and/or 
lenvatinib  and  advanced  RET  mutant  medullary  thyroid  cancer  (MTC)  following  prior  treatment  with 
cabozantinib and/or vandetanib. In order to  fulfil  this CMA, clinical data are  to be provided as a SOB 
from two separate ongoing phase 3 studies within a specified timeframe (Annex II of the SmPC); J2G-
MC-JZJC  (LIBRETTO-431)  in  treatment-naive  RET-fusion  non-squamous  NSCLC  and  J2G-MC-JZJB 
(LIBRETTO-531) in previously untreated RET-mutant MTC. 
The provided efficacy data in support of the currently intended indication “advanced RET fusion positive 
NSCLC” is based on results from the ongoing study LOXO-RET-17001 (LIBRETTO-001) as of the cut-off 
date of 21 June 2021. This was an open-label, multicentre, Phase 1/2 study which consisted on a dose 
escalation  phase  (Phase  1)  to  determine  the  MTD  and  RP2D  of  selpercatinib  followed  by  a  Phase  2 
expansion with diverse RET-altered cancer cohorts (6 cohorts), among them NSCLC (1L/2L), MTC, and 
other tumours.  
The Phase 1 portion of the study has been completed. The Phase 2 portion is ongoing and continuing to 
enroll patients with advanced solid tumours. The study was however closed for enrollment of patients 
with RET fusion-positive NSCLC in May 2020.  
Design and conduct of clinical study 
LIBRETTO-001 is non-randomized and non-blinded single arm study. The absence of a control arm is an 
important limitation and a source of bias for a confirmatory study. Overall, inclusion and exclusion criteria 
are considered acceptable. Amendments made on eligibility criteria since the initial submission of the 
CMA (DCO of June 2019) are not expected to have a substantial impact on study population or efficacy 
data. A new cohort, cohort 6, was introduced by amendment protocol (version 9) to include patients who 
discontinued  another  selective  RET  inhibitor  because  of  intolerance.  Efficacy  data  from  patients  with 
NSCLC in this cohort is not yet available and this was adequately reflected in the therapeutic indication. 
The RP2D of selpercatinib (160 mg BID) was selected in Phase 1 and has been used as the starting dose 
for patients in the Phase 2 of the study. Patients continued selpercatinib dosing in 28-day cycles until 
PD, unacceptable toxicity, or other reason for treatment discontinuation. Patients with PD could continue 
selpercatinib if, in the opinion of the investigator,  they deriving clinical benefit from  continuing study 
treatment.  
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  ORR  based  on  RECIST  v1.1.  Given  the  uncontrolled  design  of  the 
clinical trial, ORR could be an acceptable primary endpoint. PFS, OS and DOR were assessed as secondary 
endpoints. CNS ORR and DOR were also included as secondary endpoints. It is important to consider 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/583379/2022  
Page 56/80 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
that even if results in term of ORR are outstanding, interpretation of benefit in term of survival endpoints 
is difficult and uncertain in uncontrolled setting.  
Some non-substantial modifications are made to the SAP as outlined in the SAP addendum 1 dated 14 
June 2021. There is no change to efficacy analysis sets defined in the original version of the SAP. FDA 
censoring rules were used for DoR and PFS. 
Up to DCO of 15 June 2021, 921 patients were screened. Of these, 123 patients have failed screening 
(13.4%),  with  main  reason  not  satisfying  all  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria.  796  patients  had  been 
enrolled in the Phase 1 and Phase 2 cohorts and were treated with at least 1 dose of selpercatinib. Of 
these,  356  patients  had  RET  fusion-positive  NSCLC.  All  these  patients  fulfilled  the  efficacy  dataset 
requirement to allow for appropriate response assessment  (at least 6 months of a potential follow-up 
time). One patient from cohort 6 received prior treatment with a selective RET inhibitor and therefore is 
not included in the efficacy analysis. Of the 355 patients with RET fusion-positive NSCLC, 69 patients 
were treatment-naïve and 247 patients were previously treated with platinum based chemotherapy. Of 
note,  this  corresponds  to  enrolment  of  21  additional  treatment-naïve  patients  and  29  additional 
previously treated patients from 30 March 2020 to 15 June 2021. 
Of the 355 patients with RET fusion-positive NSCLC, 165 (46.5%) patients were still on treatment. Of 
the  69  treatment-naïve  patients,  46.4%  of  patients  were  still  on  treatment  and  the  main  reason  for 
treatment discontinuation was disease progression (37.7%) followed by AEs (8.7%). Of the 247 patients 
who  were  previously  treated,  47.4%  of  patients  were  still  on  treatment  and  the  main  reason  for 
treatment discontinuation was disease progression (29.6%) followed by AEs (9.3%). 
The MAH provides information on study conduct from Protocol version 8.0 up to Protocol version 9.0 (03 
June 2020). Some of the changes introduced with Protocol v8 are the addition of the new cohort 6 to 
allow  the  inclusion  of  patients  previously  treated  with  another  RET-selective  inhibitor  with  around 50 
patients  planned to  be  enrolled.  Moreover,  with  protocol  v9  the  number  of  patients  to  be  enrolled  in 
Cohort 1 is increased to 250 participants and Cohort 5 up to approximately 200 in order to accommodate 
enrollment demand of patients with RET fusion-positive solid tumours other than NSCLC and to allow for 
the characterization of AEs that may occur with low frequency.  
Regarding protocol deviations, 25.8% of NSCLC patients had at least one major protocol deviation.  
Baseline demographics and disease characteristics for patients previously treated with platinum based 
chemotherapy remain consistent with those provided at the DCO of June 2019.  
Treatment-Naïve Patients had a median age of 63 years (range: 23-92), being 10% 75 years or older. 
62.3% of patients were female, 69.6% were White and 18.8% Asian. The majority of patients had an 
ECOG PS of 0 (36.2%) or 1 (58%) and had never smoked (69.6%) or were former smokers (27.5%). 
History  of  metastatic  disease  was  present  in  98.6%  and  23.2%  of  patients  had  CNS  metastases  at 
baseline. The median time from initial diagnosis and diagnosis of metastatic disease were 2.0 and 1.6 
months, respectively. 98.6% had metastases and 1.4% had advanced disease at enrollment as reported 
by the Investigator.  
The  most  common  fusion  partners  were  KIF5B  (70%)  and  CCDC6  (14.5%).  Moreover,  there  were  8 
patients (11.6%) in which fusion partner was unknown. In the majority of cases, the RET alteration was 
determined by NGS, 60.9% on tumour and 30.4% on plasma/blood. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The evidence supporting of the claimed indication in first line NSCLC came from the 69 treatment naïve 
patients which could be considered limited to generate evidence. Supportive evidence came mostly from 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/583379/2022  
Page 57/80 
 
 
 
 
the 247 patients previously treated (Platinum-Based Chemotherapy) and the 26 evaluable patients who 
had CNS measurable disease by IRC.  
Treatment-naïve advanced NSCLC 
As of the cut-off date of 21 June 2021, the ORR among 69 treatment-naïve patients was 84.1% (95% 
CI: 73.3, 91.8) by IRC and 85.5% (95% CI: 75.0, 92.8) by Investigator (Inv). Concordance between 
the IRC and Investigator assessments is 89.9% (95% CI: 80.2, 95.8).  
The  median  DOR  by  IRC  was  20.2  months  (95%  CI:  13.0,  NE)  with  39.7%  of  patients  continuing 
treatment or PD free at median follow-up of 21.2 months. The mDOR by inv was 20.27 months (14.8; 
NE). Kaplan-Meier estimates of the rate of duration of response at 12 months was 66.1% (95% CI: 51.6, 
77.3) and at 24 months was 41.6% (95% CI: 25.6, 56.8). A stable median cannot yet be estimated. 
The median TTR by IRC was 1.81 months, with most patients demonstrating an initial and best response 
at the first post-baseline radiographic assessment.  
Median  duration  of  observed  PFS  by  IRC  was  21.95  months  (95%  CI:  13.8,  NE)  with  53.6%  of  the 
patients  remaining  progression  free  with  a  median follow-up  of  21.91  months.  mPFS  by  inv  is  20.73 
months (13.6, NE). PFS data is not yet considered mature. KM estimates of the rate of PFS by IRC at 12 
months or more was 70.6% (95% CI: 57.8, 80.2), and at 24 months was 41.6% (95% CI: 26.8, 55.8). 
Sensitivity analyses for PFS and DOR where patients who received a subsequent anti-cancer therapy are 
imputed as event were provided and results were consistent with the main analyses.   
Median duration of observed OS was not estimable  with 71.0% patients remaining alive at a median 
follow-up of 25.2 months. The rate of OS at 24 months was 69.3%, and at 36 months was 57.1%. 
Analysis  by  subgroups  in  the  treatment  naïve  patient’s  population  did  not  reveal  any  remarkable 
difference to main analysis. Overall, ORR were mostly in line with the main analysis. 
Prior-platinum treated advanced NSCLC 
The ORR in the 247 patients previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy (previously named 
IAS)  was  of  61.1%  (95%  CI:  54.7,  67.2)  by  IRC  and  64.4%  (95%  CI:  58.1,  70.3)  by  Inv  with  a 
concordance rate of 74.9% (69.0, 80.2). There were 133 PRs (53.8%) and 18 CRs (7.3%). 
The median TTR by IRC was 1.87 months. Estimated mPFS by IRC was 24.94 months (95% CI: 19.3, 
NE) with a median follow-up of 24.71 months. mPFS by inv was 21.75 months (95% CI: 16.8, 24.9). 
Due to the number of patients who were progression free (55.9%), the PFS data is not yet mature. KM 
estimates of the rate of PFS by IRC at 12 months was 70.5% (95% CI: 64.1, 76.0) and at 24 months 
was 51.4% (95% CI: 44.3, 58.1).  
The  median  DOR  by  IRC  was  28.6  months  (95%  CI:  20.4,  NE)  with  49.0%  of  patients  continuing 
treatment or PD free at median follow-up of 21.2 months. The mDOR by inv was slightly lower (21.22 
months (95% CI: 18.4, 31.8).  This could be explained by the fact  that the data are still not mature, 
with censoring rates of 50.3% (investigator assessed) and 60.9% (IRC-assessed).  
Median duration of OS was not estimable with 57.9% of the patients remaining alive and continuing OS 
follow-up at a median follow-up time of 26.4 months. The rate of OS at 24 months was 68.9%, and at 
36 months was 58.5%.  
Overall results were consistent with those of the primary analysis that led to the initial CMA. 
ORR  remained  consistent  across  the  pre-specified  subgroups  except  for  subgroups  of  the  RET  fusion 
partner genes where the ORR for patients with CCDC6-RET (81.1%; 95% CI, 68.0, 90.6) was higher 
compared to those with KIF5B-RET fusion (55.6%; 95% CI, 47.3, 63.6). Response appears to be lower 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/583379/2022  
Page 58/80 
 
 
 
 
in  those  patients  with  non-KIF5B/non-CCDC6  fusion  (47.6%)  although  the  number  of  patients  is  low 
(n=21).  Although  these  results  cannot  be  readily  attributed  to  a  specific  covariate(s)  or  identified 
mechanistic differences in the underlying biology, the ORRs observed in the NSCLC population with KIF5B 
(55.6%; n=153), CCDC6 (81.1%; n=53), and non-KIF5B/CCDC6 (47.6%; n=21) exceed those observed 
with standard chemotherapy (8.8% to 23%) or monotherapy immune checkpoint inhibitors (13.7% to 
33.1%).  The  confirmatory  Phase  3  study,  LIBRETTO-431,  will  provide  an  opportunity  to  obtain  more 
data on the efficacy of selpercatinib with different fusion partners, data on the predictive and prognostic 
value of different fusion partners, and inform whether this result is potentially attributable to underlying 
biology or is unique to the LIBRETTO-001 dataset. 
The ORR benefit of selpercatinib for the intended population was observed regardless of line of treatment. 
But, higher ORR in the treatment-naïve population (81%) were observed and this subpopulation has a 
lower K-M estimates of median PFS (21.95 months) and mDOR (20.2 months) compared to the prior-
platinum  subpopulation (24.94 months  and  28.6 months,  respectively).  The MAH  clarified  that this is 
likely a result of the random statistical variability that comes from comparing point estimates in a small 
dataset that is not yet mature. 
CNS responses 
CNS metastasis are common in lung cancer patients. Of the 355 patients with NSCLC, 106 patients had 
CNS metastasis at baseline by Inv, of whom  26  had  CNS measurable disease by  IRC.  ORR  in  the 26 
patients with measurable CNS metastasis was 84.6% (95% CI: 65.1, 95.6), including 7 CRs (27%) and 
15 PRs (58%) with a median duration of response of 9.36 months (95% CI: 7.4, 15.3). Median PFS by 
IRC for these patients (N=26) was 11.01 months (95% CI: 9.2, 17.1). 
ORR was much lower in the total 80 patients with non-measurable CNS metastasis at baseline with ORR 
of 37.5% (95% CI: 26.9, 49.0), by IRC. Per RECIST 1.1, in a non-measurable population, only patients 
achieving a CR are considered to be responders. The median CNS DOR by IRC for these patients was 
not yet reached (95% CI: 22.1, NE) at a median follow-up time of 20.70 months. 
Responses were observed both in patients previously treated with platinum based chemotherapy as well 
as treatment-naïve patients. 
Other supportive analyses 
In patients with RET fusion-positive NSCLC previously treated with other systemic therapy (N=19), ORR 
by IRC was 47.4% (95% CI: 24.4, 71.1), the mDOR was 15.84 months with median duration of follow-
up of 28.52 months. mPFS by IRC was 19.42 months (95% CI: 3.5, 30.5) with a median follow up of 
30.26 months. 
Among Patients with non-measurable RET fusion-positive NSCLC by inv (N=20), 8 patients were deemed 
to have measurable disease by the IRC. The ORR by IRC was 40.0% (95% CI: 19.1, 63.9). mDOR by 
IRC  was  22.21  with  median  duration  of  follow-up  of  21.16  months.  mPFS  by  IRC  was  18.69  months 
(95% CI: 9.1, NE) with a median follow-up of 22.08 months. 
In the first enrolled 105 previously treated patients, who have the longest potential follow-up time, ORR 
by IRC was 61.9% (95% CI: 51.9, 71.2). mDOR was 20.86 months with median duration of follow-up 
of 28.75 months. mPFS by IRC was 19.25 (95% CI: 13.9, 30.4) with a median follow up of 30.32 months. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The  updated  efficacy  results  from  the  ongoing  phase  1/2  study  LIBRETTO-001  in  previously  treated 
NSCLC are consistent with those provided in the original submission. For treatment naïve patients, the 
obtained ORR of 84% is considered clinically meaningful. Responses seem durable and K-M estimates 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/583379/2022  
Page 59/80 
 
 
 
 
for  median  PFS  and  OS  allow  to  anticipate  lasting  benefits  from  treatment.  Selpercatinib  has  shown 
activity in patients with CNS disease regardless of line of therapy.  
Although, other approved front-line therapies with established benefit exist, efficacy with selpercatinib 
is considered of sufficient magnitude and across multiple lines of therapy. Since efficacy results are based 
on a single clinical trial with a low number of treatment-naïve subjects (n=69), data corresponding to a 
longer follow-up are still required as well as efficacy results from the ongoing phase 3 study LIBRETTO-
431 (the SOB study related to the CMA). 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Safety data are available from a total of 796 patients in the LIBRETTO 001 study which is still ongoing.  
All patients in the ITT population received at least one dose of selpercatinib as of the data cutoff date of 
15 June 2021. 
Table 33. Description of Safety Analysis Sets (Data Cutoff Date: 15 June 2021) 
Patient exposure 
Through 15 June 2021, a total of 796 patients have been treated with selpercatinib at doses ranging 
from  20  mg  QD  to  240  mg  BID,  most  patients  (96%  )  received  at  least  1  dose  of  the  selpercatinib 
recommended dose (Phase 2 dose) of 160 mg BID. 
Five hundred thirty-nine (539) patients (68%) were still on study, of which 462 patients (58%)  were 
still receiving selpercatinib and 77 patients (10%) were in follow-up, but off treatment.

The most common reason for treatment discontinuation in the Overall Safety Population was disease 
progression (23%), followed by AE (8%). 
In the NSCLC Safety Population, 95.8% patients received at least 1 dose of selpercatinib 160 mg BID 
and 87.4% patients had a selpercatinib starting dose of 160 mg. 
Table 34. Treatment and study disposition (NSCLC Safety Population) 
The  median  time  on  treatment  was  21.29  and  19.09  months,  respectively,  for  the  Overall  Safety 
Population and NSCLC Safety Population. 
The most reported dose modification was dose  withheld (72.9% in the Overall Safety Population  and 
77.5%  in  the  NSCLC  Safety  Population)  primarily  attributed  to  adverse  events  (AEs)  (64.1%  in  the 
Overall Safety Population and 68.8% in the NSCLC Safety Population).

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The most frequently reported TEAEs leading to doses being withheld in 5% or more patients in both the 
Overall Safety Population and Treatment-Naïve Patients were ALT increase, AST increased, diarrhoea, 
and hypertension. 
The most frequently reported TEAEs leading to a dose reduction in 5% or more patients in both  the 
Overall Safety Population and Treatment-Naïve Patients were ALT increase and AST increase the increase 
and AST increase 
The most frequently reported TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation of selpercatinib in 4 or more 
patients in the Overall Safety Population were ALT increased, fatigue, AST increase, and sepsis. All other 
AEs  occurred  in  less  than  4  patients.  In  Treatment-Naïve  Patients  no  events  leading  to  permanent 
discontinuation of selpercatinib were reported in more than 1 patient. 
Post marketing experience 
As  of  April  2021,  Selpercatinib  was  approved  in  34  countries  including  those  in  the  EU,  the  US  and 
Switzerland for treatment of patients with RET fusion-positive NSCLC, RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer 
and  RET-mutant  medullary  thyroid  cancer.  Specific  patient  populations  and  dosing  guidance  vary  by 
country. Cumulatively, up to the 30 April 2021, an estimated 590 patients were exposed to selpercatinib 
worldwide. The data reported from the post marketing setting, is generally consistent with the known 
safety  profile  of  selpercatinib.  Most  events  were  reported  as  non-serious  and  the  most  frequently 
reported events were recognised ADRs for selpercatinib or clinically expected in the target indication. 
Overall,  no  new  significant  safety  information  has  been  identified  from  post  marketing  sources.  The 
periodic  safety  update  report/periodic  benefit-risk  evaluation  report  with  a  data  lock  of  08  May  2021 
confirmed and supported the previously established  favourable benefit-risk profile for  selpercatinib in 
the currently approved indications. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety was evaluated in patients in the Overall Safety Population (N=796) and in the NSCLC Safety 
Population (N=356) who received at least 1 dose of selpercatinib as of the data cutoff date of 15 June 
2021.  
In terms of exposure, the median time on treatment was 21.29 and 19.09 months, respectively, for 
the Overall Safety Population and NSCLC Safety Population. In the Treatment-Naïve Population 
(n=69), the median treatment duration is 18.5 months (range: 0.4 to 41.2 months) and 70% of 
patients were on treatment for at least 12 months. 
The median relative dose intensity was similar for the Overall Safety Population (94.1%) and the 
NSCLC Safety Population (92.7%). 
The most reported dose modification was dose withheld (72.9% in the Overall Safety Population and 
77.5% in the NSCLC Safety Population) primarily attributed to adverse events (AEs) (64.1% in the 
Overall Safety Population and 68.8% in the NSCLC Safety Population). 
The types and incidence rates of AEs leading to doses being withheld, dose reductions, and treatment 
discontinuation were consistent between the Overall Safety Population and Treatment-Naïve Patients. 
The most frequent TEAEs occurring in 30% or more patients in both the Overall Safety Population and 
Treatment-Naïve Patients were oedema, diarrhoea, fatigue, dry mouth, hypertension, AST increased, 
ALT increased, constipation, rash, abdominal pain, and nausea. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/583379/2022  
Page 71/80 
 
 
 
 
The most frequent Grade ≥3 TEAEs reported in 5% or more patients in both the Overall Safety 
Population and Treatment-Naïve Patients were hypertension, followed by ALT increased and AST 
increased, hyponatraemia.  
The most frequent TESAEs reported in 2% or more patients both in the Overall Safety Population and 
Treatment-Naïve Patients were pleural effusion, dyspnoea, and hyponatraemia. 
Fatal TEAEs were reported in 21 patients at the initial MAA compared with 45 patients at the 15 June 
2021 data cut-off. In Treatment-Naïve Patients, a fatal (Grade 5) TEAE was experienced by a total of 4 
patients (6%), including 1 patient who died more than 28 days after the last dose of selpercatinib. 
None in the NSCLC Safety Population were reported by the investigator as treatment-related. 
The adverse events of special interest (AESIs) analyzed did not change compared to those reported 
previously. 
The safety profile observed in the data from the 15 June 2021 cut-off remains consistent with 
previously reported data. No new ADRs or AESIs have been identified since initial authorisation and the 
safety profile is consistent between the Treatment-Naïve Patients and the Overall Safety Population. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The  overall  safety  profile  of  selpercatinib  in  Treatment-Naïve  Patients  is  consistent  with  that  of  the 
Overall  Safety  Population.  The  updated  results  provided  in  this  analysis  show  the  safety  profile  of 
selpercatinib is consistent with that reported previously, even with longer duration of treatment.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The  MAH  is  seeking  an  extension  of  indication  of  selpercatinib  (RETSEVMO)  currently  authorised  in 
patients with RET fusion-positive NSCLC previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy to include 
the first-line setting.  
The agreed indication is: as monotherapy for the treatment of adults with advanced RET fusion-positive 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) not previously treated with a RET inhibitor. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Although patients with RET fusion-positive NSCLC have an identifiable driver alteration, until recently, 
they received the same standard-of-care treatment as patients with NSCLC who do not have a driver 
alteration, as there were no RET-targeted approved therapies. Standard first-line systemic treatment is 
platinum doublet-based cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or a checkpoint inhibitor. Available options include 
pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, bevacizumab, and pemetrexed, all in combination with platinum-based 
chemotherapy regimens. Pembrolizumab monotherapy is only an option for patients with significant PD-
L1 expression. 
In the second line setting, the preferred treatment strategy is systemic immune checkpoints inhibitors, 
as nivolumab, pembrolizumab or atezolizumab, or other systemic therapy as docetaxel, pemetrexed or 
ramucirumab with docetaxel, nintedanib with docetaxel, among others.  
As of November 2021, pralsetinib (GAVRETO) a selective RET inhibitor, has received conditional approval 
in patients with advanced RET fusion-positive NSCLC. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Clinical safety and efficacy of selpercatinib in treatment-naive patients with RET fusion-positive NSCLC 
are based on analyses of interim data from LIBRETTO-001 (LOXO-RET-17001). 
LIBRETTO-001 is a global, multi-cohort, open-label, Phase 1/2 study in adult and adolescent patients 
with advanced RET-altered tumours. The Phase 2 portion evaluates efficacy in cohorts based on tumour 
type, type of RET alteration, and prior treatment. The primary objective was to determine ORR by IRC 
assessment according to RECIST 1.1, or Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria. DOR, 
PFS and OS were secondary endpoints. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Treatment-naïve  
At data cut-off 15 June 2021, 69 treatment-naïve patients were efficacy evaluable and the ORR (IRC 
assessment)  was  84.1%  (95%  CI:  73.3,  91.8).  Four  (4)  patients  exhibited  a  confirmed  CR  and  54 
patients experienced PR. ORR according to investigator assessment was in line with the IRC assessment 
(ORR 85.5% [95% CI: 75; 92.8]).  
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/583379/2022  
Page 75/80 
 
 
 
 
The median TTR was 1.81 months and, in 66% of responders, DOR was more than 12 months. Median 
DoR  was  20.21  (13.0-NE),  with  a  median  duration  of  follow-up  of  20.27  months.  However,  a  stable 
median cannot yet be estimated.  
The median PFS (IRC) was 22.0 months (95% CI: 13.8, NE+), with 29/69 (42%) events observed and 
median follow-up of 21.9 months. Median OS was not reached at the time of the DCO (29% of events 
observed).  The  OS  rate  was  92.7%  at  12  months,  69.3%  at  24  months,  and  57.1%  at  36  months. 
Efficacy of selpercatinib seems consistent across most important subgroups. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The uncertainties and limitations are mainly related to the uncontrolled nature of the pivotal trial which 
hampers the interpretation of the time-to-event endpoints (PFS, OS).  
Even though updated efficacy data have been provided for NSCLC patients regardless of line therapy, 
the median OS continued to be not estimable. The KM estimates from  time-to-event  endpoints (PFS, 
OS) seem promising, but they remain immature. 
These limitations will be addressed post authorisation with the submission of updated data and longer 
follow-up from the LIBRETTO-001 study and the conduct of LIBRETTO-431, a randomised phase III trial 
in patients with locally advanced or metastatic, RET-fusion-positive non-squamous NSCLC. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Safety data are available from a total of 796 patients in the LIBRETTO-001 study. 
Safety  was  evaluated  in  patients  in  the  Overall  Safety  Population  (N=796)  and  in  the  NSCLC  Safety 
Population (N=356) who received at least 1 dose of selpercatinib as of the data cutoff date of 15 June 
2021. 
In terms of exposure, the median time on treatment was 21.29 and 19.09 months, respectively, for the 
Overall Safety Population and NSCLC Safety Population. In the Treatment-Naïve Population (n=69), the 
median treatment duration is 18.5 months (range: 0.4 to 41.2 months) and 70% of patients were on 
treatment for at least 12 months. 
The median relative dose intensity was similar for the Overall Safety Population (94.1%) and the NSCLC 
Safety Population (92.7%). 
The most reported dose modification was dose  withheld (72.9% in the Overall Safety Population  and 
77.5%  in  the  NSCLC  Safety  Population)  primarily  attributed  to  adverse  events  (AEs)  (64.1%  in  the 
Overall Safety Population and 68.8% in the NSCLC Safety Population). 
The types and incidence rates of AEs leading to doses being withheld, dose reductions, and treatment 
discontinuation were consistent between the Overall Safety Population and Treatment-Naïve Patients. 
The most frequent TEAEs occurring in 30% or more patients in both the Overall Safety Population and 
Treatment-Naïve  Patients  were  oedema,  diarrhoea,  fatigue,  dry  mouth,  hypertension,  AST  increased, 
ALT increased, constipation, rash, abdominal pain, and nausea. 
The most frequent Grade ≥3 TEAEs reported in 5% or more patients in both the Overall Safety Population 
and  Treatment-Naïve  Patients  were  hypertension,  followed  by  ALT  increased  and  AST  increased, 
hyponatraemia. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/583379/2022  
Page 76/80 
 
 
 
 
The most frequent TESAEs reported in 2% or more patients both in the Overall Safety Population and 
Treatment-Naïve Patients were pleural effusion, dyspnoea, and hyponatraemia. 
Fatal TEAEs were reported in 21 patients at the initial MAA compared with 45 patients at the 15 June 
2021 data cut-off. In Treatment-Naïve Patients, a fatal (Grade 5) TEAE was experienced by a total of 4 
patients (6%), including 1 patient who died more than 28 days after the last dose of selpercatinib. None 
in the NSCLC Safety Population were reported by the investigator as treatment-related. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The uncontrolled design of LIBRETTO-001 study and the limited median exposure (11.7 months) do not 
allow  to  clearly  disentangle  signs/symptoms  of  the  underlying  malignancy  and  selpercatinib-related 
adverse  events  (AEs),  limiting  precise  evaluation  of  selpercatinib’s  safety  profile.  Data  on  long-term 
safety is also lacking. Long-term follow-up from the LIBRETTO-001 and the randomised phase 3 study 
LIBRETTO-431, to be submitted post approval, will address these uncertainties.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Data  supporting  this  application  are  based  on  one  single-arm  trial  (LIBRETTO-001),  which  make 
interpretation of time to event endpoints and any potential long-term benefit challenging. Nevertheless, 
this approach is acceptable in the context of a CMA for a product intended for a rare population with an 
unmet medical need as long as the effect observed in ORR is outstanding and durable.  
For  treatment  naïve  patients,  clinical  data  from  a  larger  and  more  mature  dataset  of  patients  are 
available  (median  follow-up  time  of  20  months).  The  obtained  ORR  of  84%  is  considered  clinically 
meaningful.  Available  results  suggest  that  these  responses  are  durable  (mDOR  20  months)  and  K-M 
estimates for median PFS and OS allow to anticipate lasting benefits from treatment. Of note, the ORR 
benefit for the intended population was observed with selpercatinib regardless of line of treatment, with 
higher ORR in the treatment-naïve population. 
Although,  other  approved  front-line  therapies  with  established  benefit  exist  (platinum  based 
doublets/immune  checkpoint  inhibitor),  efficacy  with  selpercatinib  is  considered  compelling  and  of 
sufficient  magnitude.  Indirect  comparisons  of  available  results  (KM  estimates  of  PFS  and  OS)  with 
selpercatinib against those reported with chemo-immunotherapy in ‘all-comer’ NSCLC patients in studies 
IMpower130, IMpower150 and KEYNOTE-189 seem promising and give some support to the benefit of 
targeted treatment in the first line. In addition, clinically meaningful intracranial responses are observed 
with  selpercatinib  in  patients  with  CNS  metastases,  which  represents  a  significant  advantage  over 
standard chemotherapy approaches. 
In November 2021, another RET inhibitor Gavreto (pralsetinib) was granted a conditional approval in the 
target population which outlines the advantage of targeted RET treatment: the single-arm ARROW trial 
showed an ORR of 64% and mDOR of 22.3 months in 233 patients with advanced RET fusion-positive 
NSCLC. ORR among treatment naïve patients was 72.0% (60.4%, 81.8%). 
The safety profile observed in the updated data from the 15 June 2021 cut-off remains consistent with 
previously reported data. No new ADRs or AESIs have been identified since initial authorisation and the 
safety profile is consistent between the Treatment-Naïve Patients and the Overall Safety Population. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The  provided  results  from  LIBRETTO-001  have  shown  efficacy  in  term  of  confirmed  response  for  the 
treatment of this rare subtype of NSCLC. Responses seem durable and independent of treatment line. 
However, given the remaining uncertainties mostly related to the uncontrolled design of the pivotal study 
with  the  low  number  of  treatment-naïve  subjects  (n=69),  comparative  data  from  the  phase  3  study 
(J2G-MC-JZJC, LIBRETTO-431) together with further follow-up data from the pivotal trial LIBRETTO-001 
are required as confirmatory evidence (SOBs).

3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
As comprehensive data on the product are also not available in the first-line treatment of RET fusion-
positive NSCLC, a conditional marketing authorisation was requested by the applicant for this extension 
of  indication.  The  product  falls  within  the  scope  of  Article  14-a  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004 
concerning conditional marketing authorisations, as it aims at the treatment of a life-threatening disease. 
Furthermore, the CHMP considers that the product fulfils the requirements for a conditional marketing 
authorisation: 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive, as discussed above.  
It  is  likely  that  the  applicant  will  be  able  to  provide  comprehensive  data.  The  applicant  will 
provide confirmatory data from the ongoing LIBRETTO-431 study, an open-label randomised phase 3 
study comparing selpercatinib to a standard-of-care regimen with platinum-based pemetrexed therapy 
with  or  without  pembrolizumab  for  treatment-naïve  patients  with  RET  fusion-positive  nonsquamous 
NSCLC. This study is currently recruiting and the submission of the final clinical study report (CSR) is 
expected by 31 December 2024. As of 26 October 2021, the study is approximately 70% enrolled, with 
approximately 28% of patients coming from EU countries. Enrolment is projected to be completed in the 
first  half  of  2022  Results  of  the  LIBRETTO-431  study  are  intended  to  provide  a  comprehensive  data 
package and potentially convert the conditional MA into a full MA.  
• 
Unmet  medical  need  will  be  addressed,  as  selpercatinib  is  considered  to  provide  a  major 
therapeutic advantage over existing therapies based on a differential safety profile, the convenience of 
oral  administration,  and  the  provision  of  a  treatment  with  a  novel  mechanism  of  action  of  such  a 
magnitude that allows to expect that selpercatinib would be at least similarly active to first line available 
chemotherapy, immunotherapy or immunochemotherapy options. 
• 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact 
that additional data are still required. Given the positive benefit/risk and the unmet medical need in the 
applied indications as described above, this is considered fulfilled. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Selpercatinib in advanced RET fusion-positive NSCLC patients regardless of line of 
therapy is positive.

based on results from study LIBRETTO-001, an open-label, multicentre, global Phase 1/2 study of 
selpercatinib in patients with RET-altered advanced solid tumours; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.8 
and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. In addition, section 5.1 of the SmPC is revised to reflect updated 
efficacy data in previously treated RET-fusion positive NSCLC based on a data cut-off of 15 June 2021. 
The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. Version 1.3 of the RMP has also been submitted.    
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and 
to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR 
module 8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows:

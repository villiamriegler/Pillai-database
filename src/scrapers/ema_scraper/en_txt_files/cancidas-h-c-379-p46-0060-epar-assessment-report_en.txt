1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted the clinical study report of the P074 clinical study in accordance with Article 46 of 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006. 
The MAH has conducted the Phase II P074 clinical study, a multicenter, open-label, non-comparative 
study to estimate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of MK-0991 (caspofungin) in Japanese 
children and adolescents with Candida or Aspergillus infections, to obtain the additional indication in 
Japanese pediatric patients. 
The study synopsis and clinical overview are written in English, but the detailed study report is 
available in Japanese only. Therefore, only the data presented in the synopsis of the study and the 
clinical overview are discussed in this assessment report. 
2.  Study P074 
2.1.  Study procedures and subject disposition 
OBJECTIVES: 
1) To evaluate the safety and tolerability of caspofungin in Japanese pediatric patients. 
2) To evaluate the proportion of Japanese pediatric patients with a favorable efficacy response (based 
on overall response) to caspofungin therapy in each of the different infection types (invasive 
candidiasis, esophageal candidiasis, and aspergillosis). 
3) To evaluate caspofungin plasma concentration profiles and pharmacokinetic parameters obtained in 
Japanese pediatric patients. 
DESIGN: 
This clinical study was a multicenter, non-comparative, open-label study to estimate the safety, 
efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of caspofungin in Japanese paediatric patients aged 3 months to 17 
years with candidiasis or aspergillosis. 
POSOLOGY and TREATMENT DURATION: 
The posology was in accordance with the one in the SmPC for paediatric patients (12 months to 17 
years). The treatment regimen for caspofungin differed slightly based on the underlying fungal 
infections. Patients with esophageal candidiasis were to be treated for at least 7 days and a maximum 
of 28 days. Patients with invasive candidiasis were to be treated for at least 14 days and a maximum 
of 56 days. Patients with aspergillosis were to be treated for at least 14 days and a maximum of 84 
days. Patients were to be followed for 14 days after the last dose of caspofungin. 
SUBJECT INCLUSION: 
Protocol 074 enrolled patients in whom causative fungi of candidiasis or aspergillosis were detected or 
fungal infection with Candida spp. or Aspergillus spp. was strongly suspected based on clinical 
CHMP assessment report for paediatric use studies submitted according to Article 46 of 
the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

symptoms, diagnostic imaging, fungal serology, or microbiological examination (culture, direct 
microscopy/ histopathology) before dosing of the study drug. The target number of patients was 20. 
Among the 20 patients who received caspofungin at least once, 12 patients had invasive candidiasis (8 
with candidemia, 2 with pulmonary candidiasis, 1 with Candida liver abscess, and 1 with Candida 
splenic abscess). None of the enrolled patients had esophageal candidiasis. 8 patients had invasive 
aspergillosis. None of the enrolled patients had chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis or 
pulmonary aspergilloma. 
The mean age of patients with invasive candidiasis was 9.8 years (3 to 17 years). The mean duration 
of treatment (range) was 14.4 days (2 to 31 days). The mean age of patients with invasive 
aspergillosis was 9.8 years (1 to 15 years). The mean duration of treatment (range) was 15.6 days (3 
to 57 days). 
The caspofungin dose was increased to 70 mg/m2 (daily dose: not more than 70 mg) according to the 
protocol in 3 out of 20 patients (15.0%). Of these, 2 patients had invasive candidiasis and 1 patient 
had invasive aspergillosis. 
SUBJECT DISPOSITION: 
Twenty patients were included in the study, of which 13 patients completed the study. Seven patients 
discontinued the study, 3 because of adverse clinical experience, 1 for a laboratory adverse experience 
and 2 because of lack of efficacy of the test drug. 
2.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics  
The  provided  study  (protocol  74)  administered  intravenous  caspofungin  therapy  as  a  single  loading 
dose  of  70  mg/m2  on  Day  1,  followed  by  50  mg/m2  as  a  single  once-daily  maintenance  dose  on  all 
subsequent  days  to  20  Japanese  pediatric  patients  with  Candida  or  Aspergillus  infections.  The 
pharmacokinetics  of  caspofungin  in  these  Japanese  pediatric  patients  were  submitted  and  succinctly 
analyzed.  
Sampling  for  plasma  caspofungin  concentration  measurements  was  collected  throughout  the 
caspofungin treatment period, including Days 1, 4, 7, and 14 of therapy (provided the patient was still 
receiving caspofungin at that time). An assessment of various pharmacokinetic parameters (C1 hr, C24 
hr, AUC0-24 hr) was conducted.

Summary  statistics  for  pharmacokinetic  parameters  (C1  hr,  C24  hr,  and  AUC0-24  hr,)  in  each  age 
group  (infant/toddlers  [3  months  to  1  years],  children  [2  to  11  years]  and  adolescents  [12  to  17 
years]) was provided. These parameters were compared in a descriptive fashion to historical data from 
adult  Japanese  patients  with  Candida  or  Aspergillus  infections  (Protocol  062).  Pharmacokinetic 
parameters  were  also  descriptively  compared  to  historical  data  from  non-Japanese  pediatric  patients 
with Candida or Aspergillus infections (Protocol 043). 
The geometric means of AUC0-24 hr, C1 hr and C24 hr in patients of all age categories were 175.05 
μg•hr/mL,  20.60  μg/mL  and  3.34  μg/mL,  respectively.  By  age  category,  the  geometric  means  of 
AUC0-24 hr, C1 hr and C24 hr were 202.43 μg•hr/mL, 25.96 μg/mL and 3.62 μg/mL in patients of the 
age  group  of  2  to  11  years,  respectively,  and  148.26  μg•hr/mL,  15.88  μg/mL  and  3.01  μg/mL  in 
patients of the age group of 12 to 17 years, respectively. One patient in the age group of 3 months to 
1  year  was  enrolled  in  this  study,  but  the  phamacokinetics  parameters  of  this  patient  could  not  be 
calculated  because  this  patient  discontinued  from  the  study  on  Day  3  due  to  lack  of  efficacy.  The 
pharmacokinetics parameters in Japanese pediatric patients were compared to those in Japanese adult 
patients  (Protocol  062).  The  C1  hr  of  Japanese  pediatric  patients  was  a  little  higher  than  that  of 
Japanese adult patients, but AUC0-24 hr and C24 hr were similar to those of Japanese adult patients, 
thus the overall exposure of caspofungin was generally comparable. In addition, the pharmacokinetics 
parameters  in  Japanese  pediatric  patients  were  generally  similar  to  those  in  non-Japanese  pediatric 
patients (Protocol 043). 
Based  on  the  pharmacokinetic  data,  the  efficacy  of  caspofungin  in  Japanese  pediatric  patients  was 
evaluated  and  compared  relative  to  those  of  clinical  studies  in  adults  (both  Japanese  and  non-
Japanese) and in non-Japanese pediatric patients. However, the results of the study are limited due to 
the  small  number  of  pediatric  patients  included  and  do  not  contribute  new  information  to  the  known 
efficacy and safety profiles of caspofungin in paediatric patients.  
Therefore, the EU SmPC does not need to be updated.

● Section 4.2 
Paediatric patients (12 months to 17 years) 
In  paediatric  patients  (12 months  to  17  years  of  age),  dosing  should  be  based  on  the  patient’s  body 
surface area (see Instructions for Use in Paediatric Patients, Mosteller1 Formula). For all indications, a 
single 70-mg/m2 loading dose (not to exceed an actual dose of 70 mg) should be administered on Day 
1,  followed  by  50  mg/m2  daily  thereafter  (not  to  exceed  an  actual  dose  of  70  mg  daily).  If  the  50-
mg/m2 daily dose is well tolerated but does not provide an adequate clinical response, the daily dose 
can be increased to 70 mg/m2 daily (not to exceed an actual daily dose of 70 mg). 
The  safety  and  efficacy  of  caspofungin  have  not  been  sufficiently  studied  in  clinical  trials  involving 
neonates and infants below 12 months of age. Caution is advised when treating this age group. Limited 
data suggest that caspofungin at 25 mg/m2 daily in neonates and infants (less than 3 months of age) 
and 50 mg/m2 daily in young children (3 to 11 months of age) can be considered (see section 5.2).

Paediatric Patients: 
In  adolescents  (ages  12  to  17  years)  receiving  caspofungin  at  50  mg/m2  daily  (maximum  70  mg 
daily), the caspofungin plasma AUC0-24 hr was generally comparable to that seen in adults receiving 
caspofungin at 50 mg daily. All adolescents received doses >50 mg daily, and, in fact, 6 of 8 received 
the  maximum  dose  of  70  mg/day.  The  caspofungin  plasma  concentrations  in  these  adolescents  were 
reduced relative to adults receiving 70 mg daily, the dose most often administered to adolescents. 
In children (ages 2 to 11 years) receiving caspofungin at 50 mg/m2 daily (maximum 70 mg daily), the 
caspofungin plasma AUC0-24 hr after multiple doses was comparable to that seen in adults receiving 
caspofungin at 50 mg/day. 
In  young  children  and  toddlers  (ages  12  to  23  months)  receiving  caspofungin  at  50  mg/m2  daily 
(maximum 70 mg daily), the caspofungin plasma AUC0-24 hr after multiple doses was comparable to 
that seen in adults receiving caspofungin at 50 mg daily and to that in older children (2 to 11 years of 
age) receiving the 50 mg/m2 daily dose. 
Overall, the available pharmacokinetic, efficacy, and safety data are limited in patients 3 to 10 months 
of age. Pharmacokinetic data from one 10-month old child receiving the 50 mg/m2 daily dose indicated 
an AUC0-24 hr within the same range as that observed in older children and adults at the 50 mg/m2 
and  the  50  mg  dose,  respectively,  while  in  one  6-month  old  child  receiving  the  50  mg/m2  dose,  the 
AUC0-24 hr was somewhat higher. 
In  neonates  and  infants  (<3  months)  receiving  caspofungin  at  25  mg/m2  daily  (corresponding  mean 
daily  dose  of  2.1  mg/kg),  caspofungin  peak  concentration  (C1  hr)  and  caspofungin  trough 
concentration  (C24  hr)  after  multiple  doses  were  comparable  to  that  seen  in  adults  receiving 
caspofungin at 50 mg daily. On Day 1, C1 hr was comparable and C24 hr modestly elevated (36 %) in 
these  neonates  and  infants  relative  to  adults.  However,  variability  was  seen  in  both  C1  hr  (Day  4 
geometric  mean  11.73  μg/ml,  range  2.63  to  22.05  μg/ml)  and  C24  hr  (Day  4  geometric  mean  3.55 
μg/ml, range 0.13 to 7.17 μg/ml). AUC0-24 hr measurements were not performed in this study due to 
the sparse plasma sampling. Of note, the efficacy and safety of caspofungin have not been adequately 
studied in prospective clinical trials involving neonates and infants under 3 months of age. 
Assessor’s  comments:   The investigation of a medicinal product in (very) young patients is difficult 
and  PK  data  may  be  used  to  extrapolate  efficacy  and/or  safety  from  data  obtained  in  adults,  by 
comparison of the exposures. In accordance with the guideline on the role of PK in the development of 
medicinal  products  in  the  pediatric  population,  EMEA/CHMP/EWP/147013/2004,  June  2006,  the  PK 
results of this study (protocol 74) are presented as descriptive statistics of PK parameters in different 
age groups. A comparative statistical analysis (i.e. geometric mean ratios and 90 CIs) relative to adults 
is not available in module 2 and the module 5 is only provided in Japanese. 
Ideally, the data should enable assessment of variability at different maturational stages and facilitate 
the identification of cut-off points for posology adjustments. However, the number of pediatric patients 
is limited (n=20) to give an appropriate estimate of the inter-variability in each subgroup and detailed 
conclusions on PK cannot be drawn. Only a general observation can be made, namely that the PK data

in  Japanese  pediatric  patients  were  generally  similar  to  those  in  Japanese  adult  patients  or  in  non-
Japanese pediatric patients with Candida or Aspergillus infections.      
In the age group of 3 months to 1 year, the only patient discontinued from the study on Day 3 due to 
lack of efficacy and therefore, no new data is available for this age group. 
This  study  does  not  represent  the  first  evaluation  of  caspofungin  in  pediatric patients:  between  2003 
and 2009, within the pediatric program of Cancidas, protocols 33 and 42 (under the original FUM 25, 
called  later  FU2  029)  gave  important  PK  information  leading  to  adequate  dosing  recommendations  in 
neonates and infants and in children aged 2 to 17 years (see above section 4.2 and 5.2 of the Cancidas 
EU SmPC). 
In  this  context,  the  assessor  takes  note  of  this  additional  phase  II  study  in  Japanese  pediatric 
population and agrees that the SmPC should not be updated from a PK perspective.  
2.3.  Efficacy 
The proportion of patients in the full analysis set with a favorable overall response rate for each 
infection category was 66.7% (8/12 patients) in patients with invasive candidiasis and 62.5% (5/8 
patients) in patients with aspergillosis. There were no patients with esophageal candidiasis enrolled in 
this study. 
The overall response rates were generally consistent with those reported in Japanese adult patients 
and non-Japanese pediatric patients with Candida or Aspergillus infections. 
Rapporteur’s remark: 
Because of the open-label and non-comparative character of this study in a very small paediatric 
population, this study does not lead to different insight regarding efficacy or any change of the 
indication/dosing recommendations in the SmPC. 
2.4.  Safety 
Brief  summary  of  prior  paediatric  safety  data  for  caspofungin  [ref.  Safety  experience  with 
caspofungin  in  pediatric  patients,  Zaoutis  T.  et  al.  The  pediatric  Infecious  Disease  Journal, 
2009, 28, 12, 1132-1135] 
Safety  data  in  non-Japanese  pediatric  patients  treated  with  at  least  1  dose  of  caspofungin  (171 
patients) were available from 5 prospective clinical studies, including 3 pharmacokinetic studies and 2 
safety/efficacy studies. 
The  incidence  of  drug-related  clinical  and  laboratory  adverse  events  in  children  receiving  caspofungin 
was  26%  and  16%,  respectively.  The  most  common  drug-related  clinical  adverse  events  following 
caspofungin use were fever (12%), rash (5%), and headache (3%). Most of these adverse events were 
mild  in  intensity  and  transient  in  nature.  Increased  aspartate  transaminase  (AST;  7.6%),  increased 
alanine  transaminase  (ALT;  6.5%)  and  decreased  potassium  (3.5%)  were  the  most  common  drug-
related laboratory adverse events in pediatric patients treated with caspofungin.  The maximum  value 
during treatment ranged from 17 to 570 (median 89) IU/L for AST and from 16 to 434 (median 128)

the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/741236/2014

IU/L  for  ALT.  The  minimum  value  during  treatment  ranged  from  2.1  to  2.8  (median  2.6)  mmol/L  for 
serum  potassium.  These  events  resolved  (ie,  values  returned  to  within  the  normal  range)  during 
subsequent  caspofungin  therapy  or  by  the  time  of  the  14  day  follow-up  visit  in  10  (77%)  of  the 
patients  with  increased  AST,  6  (55%)  of  those  with  increased  ALT,  and  4  (67%)  of  those  with 
decreased  potassium.  None  of  these  laboratory  adverse  events  were  serious  or  led  to  caspofungin 
discontinuation. 
Although 37 (22%) of the 171 patients receiving caspofungin had a serious clinical adverse event, only 
1  event  (hypotension)  was  considered  related  to  caspofungin  therapy.  Eleven  patients  (6%)  died 
during or within 14 days of completing caspofungin therapy, but none of the adverse events resulting 
in death were considered by the reporting investigator to be related to caspofungin. Two patients (1%) 
discontinued caspofungin because of a drug-related adverse event: moderate hypotension in 1 patient 
and moderate rash in the other; the hypotension resolved after a normal saline bolus was given, and 
the rash resolved without treatment 10 days later. 
Overall,  the  proportion  of  pediatric  patients  who  experienced  a  drug-related  clinical  adverse  event 
following  caspofungin  use  (26%)  is  not  substantially  different  from  the  corresponding  incidence 
reported  in  adult  patients  (29%–55%).  The  laboratory  safety  profile  among  caspofungin-treated 
pediatric  patients  was  also  favorable,  and  the  16%  rate  of  drug-related  laboratory  adverse  events 
reported in pediatric patients compares favorably with incidence rates reported in adult patients (23%–
49%). 
The  most  common  drug-related  laboratory  adverse  events,  which  included  increases  in  hepatic 
transaminases  (AST  and  ALT)  and  decreases  in  serum  potassium,  were  also  the  most  common 
laboratory  findings  in  the  adult  population.  Liver  transaminase  elevations  in  pediatric  patients  were 
transient  and  occurred  primarily  in  patients  receiving  concomitant  hepatotoxic  drugs.  Most  elevations 
routinely  resolved  either  with  continued  caspofungin  therapy  or  immediately  following  its  cessation, 
and these findings were not associated with other liver test abnormalities or clinical sequelae. None of 
the drug-related laboratory adverse events resulted in discontinuation of caspofungin therapy. 
Safety in study P074 
Among the 20 patients in the all-patient-as-treated population, clinical adverse experiences 
occurred in 16 patients (80.0%). Among these, drug-related clinical adverse experiences occurred in 8

patients (40.0%). Major clinical adverse experiences (in ≥ 3 patients) in Japanese pediatric patients 
were rash (5/20 patients, or 25.0%), vomiting, pyrexia and abnormal hepatic function (3/20 patients 
each, or 15.0%). Major drug-related clinical adverse experiences (in ≥ 2 patients) were abnormal 
hepatic function (3/20 patients, or 15.0%). 
Serious clinical adverse experiences occurred in 3 patients (15.0%). Of these, sepsis was reported in 1 
patient, hyperventilation was reported in 1 patient and sepsis and pneumonia were reported in 1 
patient. None of these serious clinical adverse events was considered to be related to the study drug. 
There were no deaths reported in this study. 
Clinical adverse experiences leading to study therapy discontinuation occurred in 3 patients (15.0%). 
All of the clinical adverse experiences leading to study therapy discontinuation were abnormal 
hepatic function, and were considered to be related to the study drug. The intensity of abnormal 
hepatic function in the “hepatobiliary disorders (SOC)” in the 3 patients was mild in 1 patient and 
moderate in 2 patients. Two patients of 3 patients with abnormal hepatic function recovered following 
the study therapy discontinuation and 1 patient did not recover following the study therapy 
discontinuation. 
Among the 20 patients in the all-patient-as-treated population, laboratory adverse experiences 
occurred in 7 patients (35.0%). Among these, drug-related laboratory adverse experiences occurred in 
6 patients (30.0%). Major laboratory adverse experiences (in ≥ 3 patients) reported in Japanese 
pediatric patients were ALT increased (5/20 patients, or 25.0%), AST increased (4/20 patients, or 
20.0%) and gamma-glutamyltransferase increased (3/20 patients, or 15.0%). Major drug-related 
laboratory adverse experiences (in ≥ 3 patients) were ALT increased (5/20 patients, or 25.0%) and 
AST increased (4/20 patients, or 20.0%). Overall, events related to hepatic insufficiency were 
commonly reported. 
There were no deaths and other serious laboratory adverse experiences reported in this study. 
Laboratory adverse experiences leading to study therapy discontinuation occurred in 1 patient 
(5.0%). The laboratory adverse experiences leading to study therapy discontinuation were increased 
blood lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and increased C-reactive protein (CRP), and both were 
considered to be related to the study drug. The 1 patient with LDH increased had not recovered during 
at the study therapy discontinuation, CRP increased recovered following study therapy discontinuation. 
Both events were non-serious. 
Conclusion 
Caspofungin is safe and well tolerable without drug-related adverse experiences specific to Japanese 
pediatric patients. 
Although statistical comparison is difficult due to the limited number of patients in each study, in the 
Japanese Phase II study in Japanese pediatric patients (Protocol 074), the frequencies of drug-related 
adverse experiences in Japanese pediatric patients were numerically higher than in Japanese adult 
patients (Protocol 062) and in non-Japanese pediatric patients (Protocols 033, 042, 058, 043 and 044). 
Clinical significant laboratory abnormalities 
In the Phase II study in Japanese pediatric patients (PN074), frequent CSLAs (reported by ≥40% of 
patients) were increase in ALT (> 2.5 times the baseline) in 9/20 (45.0%) patients, increase in ALT (> 
2.5 times ULN) in 8/20 (40.0%) patients, platelet count decreased (<25,000/μL), and increases in AST 
and ALT (both > 2.5 times ULN) 8/20 (40.0%) patients.

Hepatic events 
In the study in Japanese pediatric patients (PN074), hepatic insufficiency reported was reported in 
9/20 (45.0%) patients. The breakdown for these is liver function test abnormal in 3/20 (15.0%) 
patients, and ALT increased in 5/20 (25.0%) patients, AST increased in 4/20 (20.0%) patients, 
gamma-glutamyltransferase increased and LDH increased in 2/20 (10.0%) patients and blood bilirubin 
increased in 1/20 (5.0%) patients as laboratory adverse experiences. The timing of initial onset of 
hepatic insufficiency was 2 to 22 days following the treatment and the duration was 4 to 27 days. 
Overall, 2 (22.2%) of the 9 patients who reported hepatic insufficiency had not fully recovered at 
completion of therapy, while the remaining 7 patients recovered following study therapy 
discontinuation or while on therapy. 
Hepatic insufficiency led to study therapy discontinuation in 4/9 (44.4%) patients. The breakdown for 
these is abnormal hepatic function in 3 patients and LDH increased in 1 patient. Two (2) patients of 3 
patients with abnormal hepatic function recovered following the study therapy discontinuation and 1 
patient did not recover following the study therapy discontinuation. In addition, 1 patient with LDH 
increased had not recovered during at the study therapy discontinuation. Although there were events 
which were not recovered following the study therapy discontinuation, all of these events were 
determined to be non-serious. Moreover, the intensity of abnormal hepatic function in the 
“hepatobiliary disorders (SOC)” in the 3 patients was mild in 1 patient and moderate in 2 patients. 
Conclusion 
Also the incidence of hepatic insufficiency in Japanese pediatric patients was numerically higher 
compared to those of non-Japanese pediatric patients and Japanese adult patients. The relatively 
commonly reported events in Japanese pediatric patients were AST increased and ALT increased. 
Effect of dose escalation 
All 3 Japanese pediatric patients who had the caspofungin daily dose increased (from 50 mg/m2 daily 
to 70 mg/m2 daily, maximum daily dose: 70 mg) started dose escalation on Day 5 or Day 6 and 
received caspofungin for a total of 14 to 20 days. Of the 3 patients who increased their caspofungin 
dose, 1 patient reported diarrhoea, blood bilirubin increased, AST increased, ALT increased and LDH 
increased. All of these events were determined to be drug-related but the patient continued on study 
drug without discontinuation, and the events recovered during the study period. 
The caspofungin dose increase within the stipulated range has no significant effect on the safety of 
caspofungin. 
Rapporteur’s remark: 
The reported adverse events in Japanese paediatric patients were similar to the ones reported in non-
Japanese paediatric patients. However, the incidence of hepatic insufficiency in Japanese pediatric 
patients was numerically higher than in non-Japanese pediatric patients. All events of abnormal hepatic 
function were mild to moderate in intensity and determined to be non-serious. However, hepatic 
insufficiency led to study therapy discontinuation in 4 patients (out of 20). 
Details of these cases were in Japanese. Therefore, the MAH is asked to provide details on these cases 
in English and discuss causality, reporting observed values, time-to-onset, concomitant medications, 
comorbidities, dechallenge/rechallenge and outcome.

The MAH should give the used definition for “laboratory adverse experience” and “clinical significant 
laboratory abnormalities”, as figures for ALT and AST increase are higher when reporting clinical 
significant laboratory abnormalities. 
2.5.  Influence on the benefit-risk balance 
The reported adverse events in Japanese paediatric patients were similar to the ones reported in non-
Japanese paediatric patients. However, the incidence of hepatic insufficiency in Japanese pediatric 
patients was numerically higher than in non-Japanese pediatric patients. All events of abnormal hepatic 
function were mild to moderate in intensity and determined to be non-serious. However, hepatic 
insufficiency led to study therapy discontinuation in 4 patients (out of 20). 
Because details of the cases of hepatic insufficiency were in Japanese, the MAH is asked to provide 
more details on these cases in English. 
In 2010, the MAH was requested to perform an in-depth analysis including time-to-onset and 
dechallenge with all cases of serious hepatic ADR, especially the cases of acute hepatic failure, hepatic 
failure, and hepatitis. 
The rapporteur’s conclusion on this post-authorisation commitment (FU2 055.1) was that the reporting 
rates for the hepatic ADR’s of interest were indeed low (<1/100.000 patients treated cumulatively). 
Assessment of causality was difficult due to the presence of several concomitant medications, pre-
existing hepatic disease and/or serious underlying medical conditions associated with hepatotoxicity. 
The reported TTO and dechallenge data only suggest a possible causal relationship, but are no definite 
proof of causality. 
Therefore, patients who develop abnormal liver function tests during caspofungin therapy should be 
monitored for evidence of worsening hepatic function and the risk/benefit of continuing caspofungin 
therapy should be re-evaluated. 
The MAH should consider the addition of a warning to section 4.4 of the SmPC on abnormalities in liver 
function test, as included e.g. in the FDA product labelling: 
“Hepatic Effects  
 Laboratory abnormalities in liver function tests have been seen in healthy volunteers and adult and 
pediatric patients treated with CANCIDAS®. In some adult and pediatric patients with serious 
underlying conditions who were receiving multiple concomitant medications with CANCIDAS®, cases of 
clinically significant hepatic dysfunction, hepatitis and hepatic failure have been reported; a causal 
relationship to CANCIDAS® has not been established. Patients who develop abnormal liver function 
tests during CANCIDAS® therapy should be monitored for evidence of worsening hepatic function and 
the risk/benefit of continuing CANCIDAS® therapy should be re-evaluated.” 
3.  Conclusion 
In the study (protocol 74), the PK data in Japanese pediatric patients were generally similar to those in 
Japanese  adult  patients  or  in  non-Japanese  pediatric  patients  with  Candida  or  Aspergillus  infections. 
Between  2005  and  2009,  within  the  pediatric  program  of  Cancidas,  protocols  33  and  42  (FUM  25, 
called  later  FU2  029)  gave  important  PK  information  leading  to  adequate  dosing  recommendations  in 
neonates and infants and in children aged 2 to 17 years (see sections 4.2 and 5.2 of the Cancidas EU 
CHMP assessment report for paediatric use studies submitted according to Article 46 of 
the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

SmPC).  Due  to  the  limited  number  of  pediatric  patients  enrolled,  this  study  does  not  provide  new 
relevant PK information and the SmPC should not be updated from a PK perspective.  
Because of the open-label and non-comparative character of this study in a very small paediatric 
population, this study does not lead to different insight regarding efficacy or posology.

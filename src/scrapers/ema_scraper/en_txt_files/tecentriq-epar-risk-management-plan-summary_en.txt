SUMMARY OF RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR TECENTRIQ 
(ATEZOLIZUMAB)  
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Tecentriq.  The RMP details 
important risks of Tecentriq, how these risks can be minimized, and how more 
information will be obtained about Tecentriq’s risks and uncertainties (missing 
information). 
Tecentriq’s Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Tecentriq should 
be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Tecentriq should be read in the context of all this 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Tecentriq’s RMP. 
I. THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR 
Tecentriq contains atezolizumab as the active substance and it is given by intravenous 
route of administration. 
Tecentriq contains the active ingredient atezolizumab and is administered for treatment 
by intravenous infusion.  The recommended dosage is either 840 mg every two weeks, 
1,200 mg every three weeks or 1,680 mg every four weeks depending on the indication.  
Monotherapy 
Tecentriq as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) 
 
after prior platinum-containing chemotherapy, or  
  who are considered cisplatin ineligible, and whose tumours have a PD-L1 
expression  5%. 
Tecentriq as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after prior chemotherapy.  
Patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant or anaplastic lymphoma 
kinase (ALK)-positive NSCLC should also have received targeted therapies before 
receiving Tecentriq.  
Tecentriq as monotherapy is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with 
metastatic NSCLC whose tumours have a PD-L1 expression 50% tumour cells (TC) or 
10% tumour-infiltrating immune cells (IC) and who do not have EGFR mutant or ALK-
positive NSCLC. 
Tecentriq as monotherapy is indicated as adjuvant treatment following complete 
resection and platinum-based chemotherapy for adult patients with NSCLC with a high 
risk of recurrence whose tumours have PD-L1 expression on 50% of tumour cells (TC) 
and who do not have EGFR mutant or ALK-positive NSCLC. 
Combination Therapy 
Tecentriq, in combination with bevacizumab, is indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients with advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have not 
received prior systemic therapy. 
Tecentriq, in combination with nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin, is indicated for the first-line 
treatment of adult patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC who do not have 
EGFR mutant or ALK-positive NSCLC. 
Tecentriq, in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin, is indicated for 
the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC.  In 
patients with EGFR mutant or ALK-positive NSCLC, Tecentriq, in combination with 
bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin, is indicated only after failure of appropriate 
targeted therapies. 
Tecentriq, in combination with nab-paclitaxel, is indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer 
(TNBC) whose tumours have PD-L1 expression  1% and who have not received prior 
chemotherapy for metastatic disease. 
Tecentriq, in combination with carboplatin and etoposide, is indicated for the first-line 
treatment of adult patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). 
Further information about the evaluation of Tecentriq’s benefits can be found in 
Tecentriq’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA 
website, under the medicine’s webpage 
(https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/tecentriq). 
II. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND ACTIVITIES TO 
MINIMISE OR FURTHER CHARACTERIZE THE RISKS 
Important risks of Tecentriq, together with measures to minimize such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about Tecentriq’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
  Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in 
the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
 
 
 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
The authorized pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to 
ensure that the medicine is used correctly; 
The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., 
with or without prescription) can help to minimize its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures.  
In the case of Tecentriq, these measures are supplemented with additional 
risk-minimization measures mentioned under relevant risks below.  
In addition to these measures, information about adverse events is collected 
continuously and regularly analyzed: including PSUR assessment, so that immediate 
action can be taken as necessary.  These measures constitute routine 
pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Tecentriq is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘Missing Information’ below. 
II.A LIST OF IMPORTANT RISKS AND MISSING INFORMATION 
Important risks of Tecentriq are risks that need special risk management activities to 
further investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely 
administered.  Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential.  Identified risks 
are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Tecentriq.  
Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is 
possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and 
needs further evaluation.  Missing information refers to information about the safety of 
the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g., on the 
long-term use of the medicine).

General factors that may be associated with an 
increased risk of drug-induced ILD include: older age, 
male sex, pre-existing lung disease, smoking, prior 
radiation therapy, prior or concomitant treatment with 
medications with known pulmonary toxicity (e.g., some 
antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and cardiovascular 
agents, biologics, and chemotherapeutics), 
inflammatory conditions (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis and 
inflammatory bowel disease).  The underlying 
malignant disease itself may also increase the risk of 
pneumonitis and be a confounder of diagnosis (Barber 
et al. 2011; Schwaiblmair et al. 2012).  
There are currently no known risk factors that may 
predispose individual patients to develop immune-

Like other autoimmune diseases, genes and 
environment/lifestyle factors are likely to contribute to 
susceptibility to myositis.  Multiple independent 
associations within the HLA 8.1 ancestral haplotype 
are the strongest genetic risk factors for idiopathic 
inflammatory myopathies.  Epidemiological data 
support a role for infections, prior lung disease, 
physical exertion, collagen implants, exposure to 
ultraviolet radiation and smoking in the development of 
inflammatory myopathies.  Females were found to be 
more prone to develop polymyositis and 
dermatomyositis, while males were more prone to 
develop inclusion body myositis.  Drugs such as 
statins, D-penicillamine, interferon-α, and 
procainamide were found to be associated with 
myositis.  The risk of developing myositis is found to 
increase with age and peaks in patients aged between 
50 to 79 years (Svensson et al. 2017).

Based on a comprehensive analysis of all the cases

(SMQ) (narrow) ‘severe cutaneous adverse reactions’ 
in patients who received treatment with atezolizumab 
as well as available data from the clinical database, 
literature (Zhao et al. 2018; Raschi et al. 2019; 
Jimenez et al. 2020), and EudraVigilance database 
with a cut-off date of 31 July 2020 and considering the 
plausible mechanism of action and background of 
Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions (SCARs) as a 
known class effect, a causal association between 
atezolizumab and SCARs has been established.  As 
such, SCARs was updated from a potential risk to an 
important identified risk. 
There are no known risk factors associated with the 
development of SCARs in atezolizumab-treated 
patients.

with a cut-off date of 29 April 2022 and considering the 
plausible mechanism of action and the class effect of 
similar-in-class drugs, a causal association between 
atezolizumab and pericardial disorders has been 
established.   
The development of immune-mediated pericardial 
disorders may be higher in patients with lung, breast 
and oesophageal carcinoma due to direct local 
extension to the parietal pericardium and in patients 
treated with chest radiotherapy (Burazor et al. 2013).

literature spontaneous case of HLH was identified with 
sufficient supportive diagnostic information (bone 
marrow biopsy, laboratory results, imaging, and 
autopsy) without alternative explanations for diagnosis 
or attribution identified. Based on potential mechanism 
of action, class effect of similar-in-class drugs, and 
considering that HLH is a rare, severe, and potentially 
fatal condition, a causal association between

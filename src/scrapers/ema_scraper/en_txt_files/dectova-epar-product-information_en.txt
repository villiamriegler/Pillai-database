CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications  
Dectova is indicated for the treatment of complicated and potentially life-threatening influenza A or B virus 
infection in adult and paediatric patients (aged ≥6 months) when: 
•  The patient’s influenza virus is known or suspected to be resistant to anti-influenza medicinal 
products other than zanamivir, and/or 
•  Other anti-viral medicinal products for treatment of influenza, including inhaled zanamivir, are not 
suitable for the individual patient. 
Dectova should be used in accordance with official guidance. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration  
Posology 
Treatment with Dectova should commence as soon as possible and usually within 6 days of the onset of 
symptoms of influenza (see section 5.1). 
Adults 
The recommended dose is 600 mg twice daily for 5 to 10 days given by intravenous infusion.

For patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy, the dose should be selected using the 
appropriate CRRT clearance (CLCRRT in mL/min). 
Hepatic impairment  
No dose modification is required (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Dectova in children aged under 6 months have not been established. No data are 
available. 
Method of administration 
Intravenous use 
Dectova is administered by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes. 
For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Renal impairment 
Zanamivir is eliminated by renal clearance, therefore the dose of Dectova when administered intravenously 
must be reduced in patients with renal impairment (see section 4.2). All patients must have their renal 
function assessed before and regularly during treatment. 
Serious hypersensitivity reactions 
Anaphylactic reactions and serious skin reactions (including erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal 
necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome) have been reported with zanamivir (see section 4.8). If any 
hypersensitivity reaction occurs during infusion of Dectova, the infusion must be stopped immediately and 
appropriate management should be instituted. 
Neuropsychiatric events 
Influenza can be associated with a variety of neurological and behavioural symptoms. Neuropsychiatric 
events, including seizures, delirium, hallucination and abnormal behaviour, have been reported during 
administration of zanamivir in patients with influenza, especially in children and adolescents. Therefore, 
patients should be closely monitored for behavioural changes and the benefits and risks of continuing 
treatment should be carefully evaluated for each patient (see section 4.8). 
Resistance in immunocompromised patients 
Treatment emergent resistance is rare with zanamivir (see section 5.1). Selection of influenza resistant 
viruses is more likely to occur following treatment with antiviral medicinal products in immunocompromised 
patients, including treatment with Dectova; it is, therefore, important to monitor for resistance and consider 
switching to alternative therapies where appropriate.

Limitations of the clinical data 
The efficacy of Dectova for the treatment of complicated influenza A or B virus infection in adults and 
children aged from 6 months has been inferred from: 
•  the in vitro activity of zanamivir; 
•  clinical and virological activity of zanamivir compared to placebo in a human influenza challenge 
study; 
•  levels of zanamivir in broncho-epithelial lining fluid and serum zanamivir from a broncho-alveolar 
lavage study; 
•  serum zanamivir levels from patients with complicated influenza (see section 5.1). 
Risk of bacterial infections 
Dectova has not been shown to reduce the risk of bacterial complications associated with influenza infection. 
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains 70.8 mg sodium per vial, equivalent to 3.54% of the WHO recommended 
maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
The potential for interactions with other medicines is low, based on the known elimination pathway of 
zanamivir. 
Zanamivir is not a substrate, inhibitor or inducer of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes nor a substrate or inhibitor 
of renal and hepatic transporters at clinically relevant concentrations (see section 5.2). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Pregnancy 
There are limited data from the use of zanamivir in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or 
indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
Reproductive studies performed in rats and rabbits indicated that placental transfer of zanamivir occurs and 
there was no evidence of teratogenicity. Results from a rat peri- and postnatal study showed no clinically 
meaningful impairment of offspring development. However, there is no information on placental transfer in 
humans. 
As experience is limited, the use of Dectova in pregnancy should only be considered if the possible benefit to 
the patient is thought to outweigh any possible risk to the foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether zanamivir is excreted in human milk. In rats, zanamivir has been shown to be secreted 
in low amounts into milk. 
As experience is limited, the use of zanamivir in breast-feeding mothers should be considered only if the 
possible benefit to the mother is thought to outweigh any possible risk to the child. 
Fertility 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Animal studies indicate no clinically meaningful effects of zanamivir on male or female fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
Zanamivir has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile 
The safety profile of zanamivir is based primarily on data from a single Phase II and a single Phase III study, 
with support from Phase I studies, a compassionate use programme, and adverse drug reactions reported for 
inhaled zanamivir. The frequency of adverse reactions is based on the number of reports in the adult 
population receiving zanamivir 600 mg twice daily intravenously in the Phase II and Phase III studies. 
Adverse reactions are listed by MedDRA system organ class. 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions considered possibly or probably related to zanamivir are 
alanine aminotransferase increased (2%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (1%), hepatocellular injury 
(1%), diarrhoea (1%) and rash (1%). The most important serious adverse reaction was hepatocellular injury, 
observed in two patients (<1%). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The frequency of adverse reactions is defined using the following convention: very common (≥1/10); 
common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1 000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10 000 to <1/1 000); very rare (<1/10 
000) and not known (cannot be estimated from available data).

Paediatric population  
The adverse reaction profile in the paediatric population is based on 71 patients aged ≥6 months to <18 years 
in the Phase II study. Overall, the safety profile in paediatric patients was similar to that observed in adults in 
the clinical studies. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked 
to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose  
There is limited experience of overdose from administration of Dectova. There is no specific antidote to treat 
an overdose of this medicine. Treatment of an overdose should consist of general supportive measures 
including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient. Zanamivir is cleared 
by renal excretion and is expected to be removed by haemodialysis. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, neuraminidase inhibitors 
ATC code: J05AH01 
Mechanism of action 
Zanamivir is an inhibitor of influenza virus neuraminidase, an enzyme that releases viral particles from the 
plasma membrane of infected cells and promotes virus spread in the respiratory tract.  
In vitro activity 
Neuraminidase inhibition occurred at very low zanamivir concentrations in vitro, with median inhibitory 
(IC50) values of 0.33 nM to 5.77 nM against influenza A and B strains respectively. 
Resistance 
Resistance selection during zanamivir treatment is rare. Reduced susceptibility to zanamivir is associated 
with mutations that result in amino acid changes in the viral neuraminidase or viral hemagglutinin or both. 
Neuraminidase substitutions conferring reduced susceptibility to zanamivir have emerged during treatment 
with zanamivir in human viruses and those with zoonotic potential: E119D, E119G, I223R, R368G, G370D, 
N434S (A/H1N1); N294S, T325I (A/H3N2); R150K (B); R292K (A/H7N9). The neuraminidase substitution 
Q136K (A/H1N1 and A/H3N2), confers high level resistance to zanamivir but is selected during adaptation 
to cell culture and not during treatment. 
The clinical impact of reduced susceptibility in these viruses is unknown, and the effects of specific 
substitutions on virus susceptibility to zanamivir may be strain-dependent. 
Cross-resistance 
Cross-resistance between zanamivir and oseltamivir or peramivir has been observed in neuraminidase 
inhibition assays. A number of neuraminidase amino acid substitutions that arise during oseltamivir or 
peramivir treatment result in reduced susceptibility to zanamivir. The clinical impact of substitutions 
associated with reduced susceptibility to zanamivir and other neuraminidase inhibitors is variable and may 
be strain-dependent. 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The H275Y substitution is the most common neuraminidase resistance substitution and is associated with 
reduced susceptibility to peramivir and oseltamivir. This substitution has no effect on zanamivir; therefore, 
viruses with the H275Y substitution retain full susceptibility to zanamivir. 
Clinical efficacy 
Human challenge study 
A double-blind, randomised study to examine the prophylactic antiviral activity and efficacy of repeat dose 
zanamivir 600 mg every 12 hours intravenously compared to placebo in healthy male volunteers against 
infection from inoculation with influenza A/Texas/91 (H1N1) virus was conducted. Zanamivir had a 
significant prophylactic effect against an experimental challenge with influenza A virus as demonstrated by 
the low infection rate (14% vs. 100% positive serology in placebo group, p <0.005), isolation of virus by 
viral culture (0% vs. 100% in placebo group, p <0.005), as well as reductions in fever (14% vs. 88% in 
placebo group, p <0.05), upper respiratory tract illness (0% versus 100% in placebo group, p<0.005) and 
total symptom scores (1 vs. 44 median score in placebo group, p<0.001). 
Bronchoalveolar lavage study 
A Phase I, open-label study to evaluate serum and lower respiratory pharmacokinetics following 
administration of intravenous and inhaled zanamivir to healthy adult subjects utilising bronchoalveolar 
lavage fluid was conducted. The 600 mg dose given intravenously best approximated epithelial lining fluid 
concentrations achieved by the approved 10 mg dose of zanamivir inhalation powder which demonstrated 
efficacy in large clinical studies in uncomplicated influenza. 
Phase III study in patients with complicated influenza 
A Phase III, double-blind, study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy, antiviral activity and safety of 
zanamivir 600 mg twice daily intravenously compared to oral oseltamivir 75 mg twice daily and 300 mg 
zanamivir twice daily intravenously in hospitalised patients (>16 years of age) with influenza. The median 
patient age was 57 years and 35% (218/615) of patients were ≥65 years, of which 17% (n=103) were 65 to 
<75; 14% (n=84) were 75 to <85, and 5% (n=31) were ≥85 years of age. Patients were stratified at 
randomisation based on time from onset of symptoms to initiation of treatment (≤4 days and 5 to 6 days). 
Eligible patients were not to have had >3 days of prior antiviral treatment. The initial 5 day treatment course 
could be extended for up to 5 additional days if clinical symptoms or patient characteristics warranted further 
treatment. The primary endpoint was time to clinical response (TTCR); clinical response was defined as a 
composite of vital sign stabilisation (temperature, oxygen saturation, respiratory status, heart rate and 
systolic blood pressure) or hospital discharge. The primary analysis was performed on the Influenza Positive 
Population (IPP) comprised of 488 patients. The study did not meet its pre-specified primary objective of 
demonstrating superiority of 600 mg zanamivir to oral oseltamivir or to 300 mg zanamivir in TTCR. There 
were no significant differences in TTCR across treatment comparisons in the overall IPP or in two pre-
specified subgroups (Table 6).

This medicinal product has been authorised under ‘exceptional circumstances’. 
This means that for scientific reasons it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this 
medicinal product. 
The European Medicines Agency will review any new information which may become available every year 
and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. 
Paediatric population  
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Dectova in 
one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment and prevention of influenza (see section 4.2 
for information on paediatric use).  
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
The serum pharmacokinetics of zanamivir administered intravenously have been studied in healthy 
volunteers receiving single escalating doses from 1 to 1200 mg and repeated doses of 600 mg twice daily for 
5 days. Hospitalised patients with influenza also have received 300 mg or 600 mg twice daily for 5 to 
10 days. 
Dose proportionality was observed in zanamivir Cmax and AUC and no accumulation of zanamivir in serum 
was evident after repeated intravenous doses of up to 600 mg. 
Distribution 
The plasma protein binding of zanamivir is very low (less than 10%). The volume of distribution of 
zanamivir in adults is approximately 16 litres, which approximates the volume of extracellular water. 
Following twice-daily administration of zanamivir solution for infusion, pulmonary epithelial lining fluid 
concentrations were 60 - 65 % of the serum concentrations at the corresponding sampling time 12 hours after 
dosing. Following twice daily administration of 600 mg zanamivir solution for infusion, median trough 
zanamivir epithelial lining fluid concentrations ranged from 419 ng/mL to 584 ng/mL and were 47-66% of 
those in the initial bronchoalveolar sample following orally zanamivir inhalation powder 10 mg twice daily. 
In vitro studies indicate that zanamivir is not an inhibitor or substrate of Breast Cancer Resistant Protein 
(BCRP), P-glycoprotein, Multidrug And Toxin Extrusion protein (MATE)1, MATE2-K, Organic Anion 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Transporter (OAT)1, OAT3, Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide (OATP)1B1, OATP1B3 and Organic 
Cation Transporter (OCT)2 transporters.  
Biotransformation 
There is no evidence that zanamivir is metabolised. 
Zanamivir is not an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 
3A4. Zanamivir is not an inducer of CYP1A2 and 2B6 and, although induction of CYP3A4 in vitro was 
observed at 50-fold higher than the clinically relevant concentrations, no interaction with CYP3A4 substrates 
is expected based on physiologically based pharmacokinetic modelling. 
Elimination 
Zanamivir is eliminated unchanged in urine by glomerular filtration. In adults with normal renal function, the 
elimination half-life is approximately 2-3 hours. 
Elderly 
The pharmacokinetics in elderly subjects was similar to young adult subjects. In the population 
pharmacokinetic analysis, age had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of zanamivir. 
Paediatric population  
The pharmacokinetics of zanamivir following a twice daily intravenous dose of 14 mg/kg for paediatric 
patients between 6 months and <6 years and 12 mg/kg for those between 6 years and <18 years of age were 
similar to those seen in adults who received 600 mg twice daily intravenously. The pharmacokinetics of 
zanamivir in subjects 6 months to <18 years of age (administered standard dose of 12 mg/kg, 14 mg/kg or 
600 mg according to age and body weight) and in adult subjects (administered standard dose of 600 mg) was 
similar (Table 7).

Renal impairment 
The serum half-life of zanamivir increases to approximately 12-20 hours in patients with severe renal 
impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min). Dectova has not been studied in patients with end-stage 
renal disease. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There are limited data on zanamivir exposure during concomitant continuous renal replacement therapy and 
very limited data with dialysis. 
Hepatic impairment 
Zanamivir is not metabolised, therefore no effect of hepatic impairment is expected. 
Race 
Pharmacokinetic studies in Thai, Chinese and Japanese healthy subjects did not identify any clinically 
relevant differences in the pharmacokinetics of zanamivir in these populations compared with Caucasians. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, 
repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, or toxicity to reproduction and development, 
with the exception of a rat embryofoetal development study (subcutaneous administration). In the rat 
embryofoetal study, there was an increase in the incidence rates of a variety of minor skeletal and visceral 
alterations, most of which remained within the background rates of the historical occurrence in the strain 
studied.

  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Dectova is and what it is used for  
Dectova contains zanamivir, which belongs to a group of medicines called antivirals. 
Dectova is used to treat severe flu (influenza A or B virus infection). It is used when other flu treatments 
are not suitable. 
Adults and children aged 6 months or more can be treated with Dectova. 
2.  What you need to know before you are given Dectova  
Do not use Dectova:  
• 
if you are allergic to zanamivir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions 
Serious skin or allergic reactions 
Serious skin or allergic reactions may occur after Dectova is given. Symptoms may include skin or throat 
swelling, difficulty breathing, blistering rash or peeling skin (see also ‘Serious skin or allergic reactions’ in 
section 4). 
Sudden changes in behaviour, hallucinations and fits 
During treatment with Dectova, changes in behaviour such as confusion and unresponsiveness may occur. 
Some people may also have hallucinations (seeing, hearing, or feeling things that are not there) or fits 
(seizures) which can lead to loss of consciousness. These symptoms also occur in people with flu who are 
not being given Dectova. So it is not known if Dectova played a part in causing them. 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you are immunocompromised (have a weakened immune system) 
Your doctor may monitor you more closely if your immune system is not working properly to ensure the 
treatment is working. Your doctor may switch you to an alternative treatment where appropriate. 
If you notice any of the above symptoms: 
  Tell a doctor or nurse immediately. 
Other medicines and Dectova  
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your 
doctor for advice before you are given this medicine. 
Driving and using machines  
Dectova should not affect your ability to drive or use machines. 
Dectova contains sodium 
This medicine contains 70.8 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each vial. This is 
equivalent to 3.54% of the recommended maximum daily intake of sodium for an adult. 
3. 
How Dectova is given  
How much Dectova is given  
Your doctor will decide how much Dectova is right for you. The amount you are given is based on your age, 
body weight, and the results of your blood tests (to check how well your kidneys are working). 
Your dose may be increased or decreased depending on how well you respond to treatment. 
Adults 
The recommended dose is 600 mg twice daily for 5 to 10 days. 
If your kidneys are not working as well as they should, your doctor will decide on the reduced dose for you. 
Children  
Your doctor will decide on the correct dose of Dectova. 
When and how Dectova is given 
Dectova should be given as soon as possible, usually within 6 days of the symptoms of flu appearing. 
A doctor or nurse will give you Dectova as an infusion (drip) into a vein. It is usually given into your arm 
over about 30 minutes. 
If you have any questions on the use of Dectova, ask the doctor or nurse who is giving it you. 
If you are given more Dectova than you should  
It is unlikely that you will be given too much, but if you think you have been given too much Dectova, tell 
your doctor or nurse immediately.  
4. 
Possible side effects  
Like all medicines, Dectova can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
25

INFORMATION FOR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS 
Dectova preparation  
• 
• 
• 
The volume of Dectova and total volume for infusion will depend on the patient’s age, weight and 
renal function (see section 4.2 of the SmPC). 
The dose can be infused as supplied or diluted in sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for 
injection down to any concentration greater than or equal to 0.2 mg/mL. 
Each vial is for single use only; once the seal has been broken, the remaining volume must be 
discarded. 
How to prepare the infusion for intravenous administration:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Use aseptic techniques throughout preparation of the dose. 
Calculate the required dose and volume of Dectova. 
Decide on the volume of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection to be used for 
infusion. 
Using a sterile needle and syringe, withdraw and discard a volume of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL 
(0.9%) solution for injection (equal to the volume of Dectova) from the infusion bag. 
Infusion bags may have a further overage of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection 
included – this can also be removed if considered necessary. 
Using a sterile needle and syringe, withdraw the volume of Dectova from the vial(s) and add to the 
infusion bag. 
Discard any unused portion of the vial. 
The infusion bag should be gently manipulated by hand to ensure it is mixed thoroughly. 
If refrigerated, the infusion bag should be removed from the refrigerator and brought up to room 
temperature before use.

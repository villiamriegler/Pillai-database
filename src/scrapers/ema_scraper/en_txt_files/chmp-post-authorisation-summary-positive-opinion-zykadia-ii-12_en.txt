EMA/CHMP/313473/2017 
Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) 
Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Zykadia 
ceritinib 
On 18 May 2017, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion 
recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Zykadia. 
The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Novartis Europharm Ltd. 
The CHMP adopted a new indication as follows: 
"Zykadia as monotherapy is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with anaplastic 
lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)." 
For information, the full indications for Zykadia will be as follows2: 
"Zykadia as monotherapy is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with 
anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC). 
Zykadia as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with anaplastic 
lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) previously treated 
with crizotinib." 
In addition, since all specific obligations of the conditional marketing authorisation have been fulfilled, the 
marketing authorisation for Zykadia will be switched from conditional to full approval. 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of 
product characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to 
the marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission.

days from adoption of the opinion

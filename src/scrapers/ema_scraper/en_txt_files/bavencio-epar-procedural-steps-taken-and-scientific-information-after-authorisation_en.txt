II and PL 
Phase I/II study to evaluate the dose, safety and 
following a P46 procedure 
(EMEA/H/C/004338/P46/009). This is a Phase I, 
multi-centre, open-label, international study to 
evaluate the dose, safety and tolerability, antitumor 
activity, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics of 
avelumab in paediatric subjects 0 to less than 18 
years of age with refractory or relapsed malignant 
solid tumours (including central nervous system 
tumours) and lymphoma for which no standard 
therapy is available or for which the subject is not 
eligible for the existing therapy. In addition, the MAH 
took the opportunity to update Annex II section D to 
be aligned with the EU Educational materials (EM) 
and the EU Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Furthermore, the MAH took the opportunity to 
implement editorial changes.

birth to less than 18 years of age with refractory or 
relapsed solid tumours including central nervous system 
(CNS) tumours and lymphoma for which no standard 
therapy is available or for which the patient was not eligible 
for the existing therapy. The study enrolled 21 paediatric 
patients with an age ranged from 3 to 17 years receiving 
either 10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg avelumab intravenously 
every 2 weeks until confirmed progression, death, or 
unacceptable toxicity. The paediatric PK parameters and 
the corresponding PK profiles for all patients were 
evaluated according to dosing and stratified by bodyweight. 
The exposure in paediatric patients receiving 20 mg/kg 
avelumab were similar or higher compared to those in 
adults receiving 10 mg/kg or 800 mg avelumab. In 
paediatric patients receiving 10 mg/kg avelumab the

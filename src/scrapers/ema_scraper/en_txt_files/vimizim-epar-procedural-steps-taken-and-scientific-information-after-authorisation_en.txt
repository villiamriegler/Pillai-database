1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Information regarding the home infusion for Vimizim has 
information relating to possibility of home infusions 
under the supervision of a healthcare professional for 
patients who are tolerating their infusions well, in 
alignment with the submission of the MOR-100 study 
report.   
In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder 
(MAH) took the opportunity to make editorial 
changes in section 5.2 of the SmPC to improve 
clarity.

C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
- Section 5.1: In an open-label trial, 15 paediatric patients 
with MPS IVA under the age of 5 years (9 months to <5 
years) received 2 mg/kg of Vimizim once a week for 52 
weeks. Safety and pharmacodynamic results in these 
patients are consistent with results observed in patients 5 
to 57 years old (see sections 4.8). 
- Section 4.8: In patients < 5 years of age, the overall 
safety profile of Vimizim at 2 mg/kg/week was consistent 
with the safety profile of Vimizim observed in older 
children.

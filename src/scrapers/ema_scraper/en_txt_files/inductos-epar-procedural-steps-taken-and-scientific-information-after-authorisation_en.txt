Study EUPAS32916 is a cross-sectional study to evaluate 
in order to submit the final study report from study 
EUPAS32916 listed as category 3 study in the RMP. 
This is an observational study to evaluate the 
effectiveness of additional Risk Minimisation 
Measures for InductOs.  
the effectiveness of additional Risk Minimisation Measures: 
A survey among 55 physicians to assess their knowledge 
and understanding of selected risks of InductOs in Europe. 
Based on the results of this study and having the limitation 
of the study in mind, it has been concluded that physicians 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to submit 
study protocol for study EUPAS32916 that was 
agreed by PRAC and to update section 4.4 of the 
SmPC to add the traceability statement for biological 
medicinal products. 
C.I.11.b - Introduction of, or change(s) to, the 
obligations and conditions of a marketing 
authorisation, including the RMP - Implementation of 
change(s) which require to be further substantiated 
by new additional data to be submitted by the MAH 
where significant assessment is required 
are not fully aware of the risk of medication errors, 
incorrect use, and heterotopic ossification and the risk 
minimization measures to prevent these risks. In addition, 
the majority of the physicians did not use dibotermin alfa 
on a regular basis, and did use (always, frequently or 
sometimes) the educational material (82%) to obtain 
information on these risks. Therefore, it has been 
concluded that the educational material should remain in 
place and actions taken to increase awareness with 
physicians on the existence of the educational materials 
and simplify the access to the materials. 
In addition, the study status of EUPAS32916 to evaluate 
the effectiveness of additional Risk Minimisation Measures 
in the RMP has been changed from ongoing to completed. 
The Annex IID text and the reference to the educational 
materials in section 10 have been maintained.

Dibotermin alfa (rhBMP-2) is a differentiation factor, which 
not administering dibotermin alfa in patients with 
history or clinical suspicion of malignancy at the site

remodeling. The PK of rhBMP-2 suggests minimal

opportunity to add the adverse event "radiculitis" in

of cases of radiculitis. The package leaflet is updated 
accordingly. The contact details of all local

circulating rhBMP-2 after local application, making a 
systemic effect unlikely. In vitro and in vivo studies with 
rhBMP-2 on malignant cell lines have not demonstrated a 
potentiating effect. Two spontaneous reports of malignancy 
at or near the site of rhBMP-2implantation have been 
investigated. In both cases, rhBMP-2 was used for 
unapproved indications. In one report, the patient had 
chemotherapy and radiation treatment for malignancy and 
malignancy recurrence, which are more likely alternative 
explanations for the development of osteosarcoma. In the 
second report, incomplete historical information is available 
making interpretation of causality difficult to establish. 
There were no other reports of malignancy developing at or 
near the site of implantation of rhBMP-2. Furthermore, a 
review of all postmarketing cases of malignancies where a 
patient with a history of malignancy was treated with 
rhBMP-2 and subsequently developed a malignancy 
identified ten reports (including the two reports mentioned 
before) describing 9 patients who developed cancer after 
rhBMP-2 treatment and who had a history of cancer. Based 
on the cases presented the contributory role rhBMP-2 
cannot be excluded. InductOs is already contraindicated for 
patients with any active malignancy or patient undergoing 
treatment for a malignancy. Nevertheless, as precautionary 
measure physicians should be advised that InductOs should 
not be used in patients with history or clinical suspicion of 
malignancy at the site of application. 
A cumulative search of the MAH's safety database through 
26 June 2009 reported 113 reports (67 spontaneous and 
46 study) describing events of radicular pain following 
rhBMP-2 use in various surgical approaches that included

of the metal cage from the initial surgical placement) can 
occur after the use of rhBMP 2/ACS in spinal fusion 
surgery. In some cases device migration may necessitate a 
surgical revision. The vast majority of cases concerned off-
label use (including unapproved surgical approach, devices 
and/or concomitant therapies) nevertheless there is 
reasonable suspicion that the occurrence of device 
migration may be causally related to dibotermin alfa. 
Review of AEs associated with device migration showed 
that most cases reported were "cyst like structures" and 
"bone resorption". These undesirable effects, already listed 
in the current SmPC, could predispose to the device 
migration. As such, they also have been reported in section 
4.8 as being in some cases associated with the device 
migration.

SmPC, Annex 
Based on the CHMP review of the available information and 
II, Labelling 
on the basis of a re-evaluation of the benefit risk balance, 
and PL 
the CHMP was of the opinion that the quality, safety and 
efficacy of InductOs continued to be adequately and 
sufficiently demonstrated and therefore considered that the 
benefit risk profile of InductOs continued to be favourable. 
From the data that became available since the granting of 
the initial Marketing Authorisation for InductOs, no new 
safety issues were identified except for the formation of 
antibodies in a clinical trial. Therefore, the CHMP concluded 
that the MAH should continue to closely monitor the 
formation of antibodies, immune response and neutralising 
antibodies.  
Furthermore, the CHMP recommended that the MAH should 
continue to monitor fluid collections, bone 
resorption/osteolysis, bone growth, infections, deep vein 
thrombosis, neurological disorders, malignancies, anaemia, 
local hypesthesia and heterotopic calcification. Additionally, 
the CHMP acknowledged that the exposure of InductOs was 
Page 18/25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
still limited due to its limited marketing. Thus, based upon 
the safety profile of InductOs, which required the 
submission of yearly PSURs, the CHMP concluded that the 
MAH should submit one additional renewal application in 5 
years time.

oedema, implant site effusion) sometimes encapsulated, in 
some cases resulting in nerve compression and pain was 
reported in patients undergoing spine surgery associated 
with the use of dibotermin alfa/Absorbable Collagen Sponge 
(rhBMP-2/ACS). Many of these reports have occurred when 
rhBMP-2/ACS was used in unapproved approaches/devices 
or in a manner inconsistent with the instructions for use. 
None of the fluid collections reported occurred in Europe. 
Therefore, the CHMP concluded that the failure to follow the 
product preparation instructions for rhBMP-2/ACS may 
compromise its safety and effectiveness: care and caution 
should be used to prevent overfilling of the construct 
and/or intervetebral space.

antibodies in a rabbit developmental toxicity study, where 
pregnant rabbits have been immunised against dibotermin 
alfa, the active ingredient for InductOs. The findings of this 
non clinical study indicated that the potential risk of anti-
dibotermin antibodies for embryo-foetal development was 
limited. In some foetuses with decreased body weights 
there were decreases in ossification of frontal and parietal 
bones (4 out of 151 foetuses), which is generally 
considered to be reversible, and antibody related effects 
could not be ruled out. There were no other alterations in 
foetal external, visceral, or skeletal morphology. Therefore 
section 5.3 "Preclinical Safety Data" of the SPC was 
updated to include the findings from this non clinical study. 
As the basis for a contraindication must be provided by 
clinical data or strong non clinical data, the CHMP 
concluded that there was no basis for a contraindication of 
the use of InductOs during pregnancy. Thus, the 
contraindication for pregnancy was deleted from section 4.3 
"Contraindication" of the SPC and replaced by a labelling 
expressing an advice against the use of InductOs during 
pregnancy in section 4.6 "Pregnancy and lactation" unless

of nerve compression associated with exuberant and/or 
ectopic bone formation and/or calcification were identified 
through the period covered by PSUR n  5. In all of these 
reports, the patient received dibotermin alfa for 
augmentation of spine fusion surgery. The patients 
reported symptoms likely to represent neurological 
complications of excess bone formation (i.e. regional pain

Therefore the MAH updated section 4.4 "Special warnings

the SPC to include information on the occurrence of 
neurological disorders in patients undergoing spine surgery.

The investigation concerned a study in which InductOs was 
substituted for autograft bone during spinal surgery using 
posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) technique and 
Telamon PEEK cages. InductOs is not approved for this 
indication in the EU, nor is it approved for use with 
Telamon PEEK cage device. None of the patients concerned 
were clinically symptomatic; the event was a radiographic 
finding. There was radiographic evidence of: "questionable 
osteoclastic activity at the deck plate and floor plate of the 
adjoining vertebral body".  
All patients improved, despite these radiographic findings; 
none of the patients were clinically symptomatic and at the 
investigations after 6 and 12 months no pathological 
findings were found. 
Although none of the event are classified as serious, the 
investigator halted the study because of the events.

16 patients, of localised cervical oedema coincident with 
the administration ofdibotemin alfa (rhBMP-2)/ACS were 
reviewed; in all of the cases the product was used off-label 
in the cervical spine. In general, the patients had an 
uneventful post-operative course and presented 1.5-7 days 
after surgery with neck swelling. Six of the patients 
recovered, with many receiving corticosteroids. Localised

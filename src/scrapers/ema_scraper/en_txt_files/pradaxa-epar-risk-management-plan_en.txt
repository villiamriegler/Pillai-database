In addition, in an observational study based on existing data during 2004 to 2008 in the US 
45 203 patients with hip replacement were followed up for a median of 70 days. The 
incidence per 1000 PY of DVT was 27.8 (95% CI: 24.4 - 31.6) [R11-4338].
Mortality of DVT
In a study based on existing inpatient data from the US NIS during the 2001 to 2011, the rate 
of inpatient mortality in THR patients with DVT was 1.7% compared to 0.2% in patients 
without DVT [R17-1283].
Co-medication
The patients after THR or TKR were prescribed LMWH (88%) or warfarin (12%) during the 
hospital stay, Australia, 1995 to 2001 [R09-5182].
A study on patients aged 65 years or older discharged home after THR or TKR in Canada, 
between 1997 and 2004, showed that 19% of the patients received thromboprophylaxis at 
discharge [R08-4652].
Hypertension
Incidence and prevalence of hypertension
Hypertension is a common and chronic co-morbidity and therefore is better described by its 
prevalence, see below.
The prevalence of hypertension among discharges undergoing THR during 2006 to 2011 in 
the US was 58.4% [R17-1276]. Among a large healthcare delivery system in the US 
(Colorado), 20.6% of patients undergoing THR and receiving warfarin during 2005 to 2009 
had hypertension [R17-1282]. A study on patients aged 65 years or older discharged home 
after THR or TKR in Canada, between 1997 and 2004, showed that 41% of the patients had 
hypertension at baseline [R08-4652].
Mortality of hypertension
No data on mortality from hypertension found in the target population. However, in a follow 
up of 24 638 patients after THR during 1980 and 1995 in Finland 54% of the deaths were 
attributed to diseases of the circulatory system [R10-5302].
Co-medication
A retrospective study investigated 285 patients who underwent TKR or THR in Pittsburgh, 
US between March 2006 and June 2006. 62% of the patients had hypertension and at least 
one medication prescribed. Of these 32% received diuretics, 29% ACE inhibitors, 26% 
calcium channel blocker, 45% beta-blocker, and 21% ARBs [R10-5299].

21.3) among patients aged 80 and older [R14-3859].
In Denmark, the prevalence of AF in men aged ≥50 years increased from 1.4% in 1976 to 
1978 to 3.3% in 1991 to 1994 while the prevalence in women aged ≥50 years remained 
between 1.0% and 1.4% [R09-2458]. In the US, from 1992 to 2002 and for adults aged 
≥65 years the prevalence of AF increased from 3.2% to 6.0% [R06-2145]. In the UK from 
1994 to 2003 all-ages prevalence of active AF increased from 0.8% to 1.3% in men and from 
0.8% to 1.2% in women [R09-2459].
The above mentioned Framingham Heart Study also assessed trends in AF prevalence from 
1958 to 2007. Age-adjusted period prevalence of AF increased in both men and women. The 
age-adjusted prevalence in men increased from 20.4 per 1000 PY in the cohort from 1958-
1967 to 96.2 per 1000 PY in the 1998-2007 cohort. In women, the age-adjusted prevalence 
rate increased from 13.7 per 1000 PY in the cohort from 1958-1967 to 49.4 per 1000 PY in 
the 1998-2007 cohort [R17-1326].
In Germany, the prevalence of AF was 2.1% based on data during 2008 from 2 statutory 
health insurance funds. Prevalence rates increased from 0.5% in men aged 45-49 up to 17.7% 
in men aged 85-89 and decreased to 16.5 among men aged >89 years. Prevalence rates 
increased from 0.2% in women aged 45-49 up to 14.0 in women aged 85-89 and decreased to 
11.8% among women aged >89 years [R17-1316]. The gender standardised prevalence of AF 
in Germany was 10.3% among adults aged 65 and older based on existing data from the 
GePaRD during 2007 [R17-1307].
The lifetime risk of developing AF in the Netherlands is 22% to 24% for men and women at 
age 55 years [R09-4875], and 23% to 26% for men and women of 50 years and older in the 
US [R09-4884].
In 2007, AF is estimated to affect a total of 6.3 million people aged ≥40 years in the US, 
Japan, Germany, Italy, France, UK, and Spain. The number of diagnosed prevalent cases is 
expected to increase to 7.5 million by 2017 primarily due to the aging population [P09-
13748].
Age- and gender-specific prevalences of AF in the US, Europe, and Asia are displayed in 
SI.Table 17, confirming the AF prevalence increase with age and male gender.

hypertension treatment in patients with incident AF was 22.1% in the cohort from 1958-1967 
and increased in each consecutive cohort with 59.2% receiving baseline treatment for AF in 
the 1998-2007 cohort [R17-1276].
Diabetes mellitus
Incidence and prevalence of diabetes mellitus
In the follow-up of 16 513 patients with a first record of AF a retrospective cohort study from 
2005 to 2010 in England yielded an incidence of diabetes of 8.3 (95% CI: 7.9 - 8.6) per 
100 PY [U10-1959-02].
SI.Table 22 provides the prevalence of diabetes mellitus from multiple studies in patients 
with AF.  The prevalence of diabetes mellitus among patients with AF ranged from 12% to 
27%.

In a population-based cross-sectional study conducted in Germany, 5.0% of all AF patients 
(n = 161, age 63.2±9.5 years, 31.8% women) received insulin and 6.5% oral antidiabetic 
medication [R12-0729].
In a CPRD study, 9.1% of AF patients in the UK during 2005 to 2010 received antidiabetic 
medication. Oral antidiabetics were received by 7.9%, insulin by 2.2% and other injectable 
antidiabetics received by <1% of AF patients [R14-0464]. 
In the 2009 National Health and Wellness Survey, 29% of 1297 adults with AF reported 
diabetes mellitus and 24% reported use of prescription medication for diabetes mellitus [R13-
0111]. 
Stroke
Incidence and prevalence of stroke
SI.Table 23 provides the incidence of stroke from multiple studies in patients with AF.  The 
incidence of stroke among patients with AF ranged from 1.6% to 2.1%. The incidence rate of 
stroke reported varied in the type of stroke, medication use, and whether the AF was 
persistent or paroxysmal.  The incidence rate ranged from 0.2 to 2.9 per 100 PY.

There are racial differences in VTE incidence, with African-Americans having the highest 
incidence and Asian populations having the lowest incidence [R12-5099]. Genetic 
predisposition to thrombosis in European populations and African-Americans may play a role 
in racial differences in VTE. Differences in risk factors for VTE across populations might 
account for some of the racial differences. However, other aspects related to surveillance for 
VTE and access to medical care might influence racial differences in VTE incidence.
The annual incidence rates by age category for DVT and PE per 100 000 population in US 
during a time period of 18 months (1985 to 1986) are shown in SI.Table 28 below [R05-

the overall US prevalence of VTE in 317 cases per 100 000 in 2002 and 422 cases per 
100 000 in 2006, representing an increase of 33.1% during the study period [R11-4373]. In 
addition, the observed prevalence of VTE was higher in women than in men throughout the 
analysis. Moreover, the prevalence of VTE in the population increased with age, with the 
highest increase of prevalence in the group of >85 years.
A study based on health insurance claims data from a large privately insured US adult 
population (MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters and MarketScan Medicare 
Supplemental Coordination of Benefits databases, Thomson Reuters, New York) estimated 
the prevalence of VTE during 2005 through 2006 in 580 per 100 000 [R11-4366].
To estimate the number of people with VTE each year in the US, the CDC analysed 2007 to 
2009 data from the NHDS [R12-5113]. The unit of analysis was hospitalisations and not the 
number of persons with the diagnosis of VTE. Therefore, multiple hospitalisations for an 
individual patient in a given year are counted more than once. Whether VTE was present on 
admission or onset occurred during the hospital stay cannot be determined, as well as if 
hospitalisations were for incident or recurrent events. The results of the analysis estimated 
that an average of 547 596 hospitalisations with VTE occurred each year among those aged 
18 years or older in the US. The average annual rates of hospitalisations with each discharge 
diagnosis was as follows: 152 per 100 000 adults for DVT, 122 per 100 000 adults for PE, 
and 239 per 100 000 adults for VTE, These estimated rates were substantially higher among 
adults aged more than 60 years than among those aged 18 to 59 years. SI.Table 33 provides 
the estimated average annual rate, per 100 000 population, of hospitalisations with a 
diagnosis of DVT, PE, or VTE, by patient sex and age group.
In the EINSTEIN cohort study of DVT and PE in North America, out of 812 participants, 326 
were treated for DVT and 486 were treated for PE. The majority of VTE patients were 
hospitalised for PE and the rest for DVT (84% and 16%, respectively) [R17-1278]. 
In Japan from January 1987 through December 1999, 0.11% (95% CI: 0.09 - 0.13) of the 
131 060 hospitalised patients at a single medical centre had a confirmed diagnosis of VTE 
[R11-4367].

venous instrumentation within 3 months, stroke, paresis or paralysis, heart failure or COPD 
[R12-5534]. 
Obesity seems to be a risk factor for both PE and DVT but the risk is more apparent among 
young people [P07-06581, R12-5534, R12-5531]. In the Copenhagen City Heart Study both 
obesity and smoking were important risk factors for VTE [R11-4531]. On the other hand, in a 
meta-analysis, smoking did not significantly increase the risk of VTE (OR, 1.15; 95% CI: 
0.92 - 1.44) but hypertension (OR, 1.51; 95% CI: 1.23 - 1.85) and diabetes (OR, 1.41; 95% 
CI: 1.12 - 1.77) did [R12-5531]. Hypertension (diastolic blood pressure ≥100 mmHg) was 
also a risk factor in the Copenhagen City Heart Study (OR, 1.34; 95% CI: 1.08 - 1.66) [R11-
4531]. Height seems to be a risk factor for VTE, especially among men [R12-5536, R12-
5534]. Pregnancy is a risk factor for VTE, and the rate of pregnancy-associated VTE is 
higher in older women (aged 35 to 44 years) than in younger women. [P07-06581, R12-
5534].
Among women, oral contraceptives are a well-known risk factor for VTE, although the 
absolute risk seems to be low. Estrogen content is positively associated with the magnitude of 
the risk. Reports regarding the effect of duration of use are inconsistent, and the effect of oral 
contraceptives is synergistic with the effect of obesity [R12-5534, P07-06581]. Hormone 
replacement therapy increases the risk of VTE by 2- to 3-fold, although the risk seems higher 
when estrogens are combined with progesterone [P07-06581, R12-5534]. On the other hand, 
the increase in risk seems confined to oral formulations, and transdermal treatments appear to 
be risk free [R12-5532]. Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen-receptor modulator used to prevent 
and treat breast cancer, has also been associated with an increase incidence of VTE [R12-
5534]. Other drugs that increase the risk of VTE, in decreasing order of magnitude, are oral 
corticosteroids, NSAIDs, and aspirin [P07-06581]. A non-interventional study conducted in 
France on 4 945 088 women found that a total of 1800 PE occurred, resulting in an absolute 
risk rate of 33 per 100 000 women years of oral contraceptive use [R17-1330].
Inherited and acquired thrombophilias, although rare, increase the risk of VTE. Much more 
common, heart failure, COPD, stroke, and cancer increase also the risk of VTE [R12-5534]. 
In a case-control study, the odds ratio of VTE was 2.08 (95% CI: 1.76 - 2.48) for heart 
failure, 1.54 (95% CI: 1.32 - 1.79) for COPD, 1.32 (95% CI: 1.13 - 1.54) for cerebrovascular 
disease, and 3.24 (95% CI: 2.84 - 3.69) for cancer [P07-06581]. Other conditions that 
increase the risk of VTE by nearly 2-fold are ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and 
nephrotic syndrome [R12-5534, P07-06581].
Although data on the risk of varicose veins is not conclusive [R12-5534], one study found an 
odds ratio of VTE for varicose veins of 1.78 (95% CI: 1.48 - 2.15) [P07-06581].

has failed to improve haemodynamic status, surgical embolectomy is the preferred therapy. If 
this is not immediately available, catheter embolectomy or thrombus fragmentation may be 
considered [P08-12590; P11-07302; P08-08095].
Current American College of Chest Physician guidelines for long-term treatment of PE and 
DVT recommend treatment with dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban over VKAs 
[P16-00349] for 3 months if there are no additional risk factors or if the risk factors were 
transient. In patients without moderate or high risk of bleeding with a second unprovoked 
episode, long-term treatment should be implemented. Long-term treatment is also 
recommended among patients with VTE and cancer, however, LMWH is recommended over 
VKA therapy, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or edoxaban. In patients who receive long-term 
anticoagulant treatment, the risk-benefit ratio of continuing such treatment should be 
reassessed at regular intervals. The dose of VKA should be adjusted to maintain a target INR 
of 2.5 (range, 2.0 - 3.0) regardless of treatment duration [P08-12590].
Intravenous LMWH or subcutaneous UFH with monitoring, weight-based subcutaneous UFH 
without monitoring, or subcutaneous fondaparinux at weight-adjusted doses without 
monitoring are also the treatments of choice for confirmed DVT [P08-08095]. For both PE 
and DVT, the heparin treatment should be continued for 5 days, combined with initiation of 
VKAs on the first treatment day, and discontinued when the INR is greater than 2.0 for at 
least 24 hours [P08-08095].
In a recent guideline by the American College of Chest Physicians, preference is given to 
LMWH or fondaparinux over intravenous or subcutaneous UHF. In this guideline, 
anticoagulation with rivaroxaban or parenteral LMWH is recommended as initial VTE 
treatment. For long-term treatment, the guideline suggests dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, 
or edoxaban over VKA in patients with VTE and no cancer. VKA is recommended over 
LMWH for the same indication [P16-00349]. In patients with VTE and cancer, LMWH 
rather than VKA therapy or other OAC is recommended. Finally, in patients with VTE and 
cancer who are not treated with LMWH, VKA is recommended over dabigatran or 
rivaroxaban for long-term therapy [P12-02755]. 
Treatment options and optimal use are provided in SI.Table 35.

The mean (SD) age of patients included in this cohort was 62 (18) years. In this study, the 
risk of recurrent VTE was higher among men than among women (RR, 1.13; 95% CI: 1.07 -
1.19).
In a population-based cohort of patients with incident VTE among all residents of Olmstead 
County (Minnesota, US) the highest recurrence of VTE occurred during the first 14-days 
(55.4 per 100 PY) [R12-5285; R12-5284]. The corresponding recurrence rates were 30.0 per 
100 PY at 90 days and 17.7 per 100 PY at 180 days.
The rates of recurrent PE (with or without DVT) among patients with VTE in a population-
based data study conducted in the US during 1999, 2001, and 2003, was 1.6% within 30 days 
of follow-up, 4.1 % within 1 year, and 5.0% within 3 years for patients aged younger than 
65 years and 1.0% within 30 days, 2.7% within 1 year, and 4.9% within 3 years in patients 
aged 65 years and older [R11-4370]. In a recent publication including additional data from 
2005, the overall rate of PE was 1.5% and of DVT was 11.5% among 2488 patients with 
VTE [R12-5107].

During the 3-month follow-up period of a study conducted in the Netherlands between 
November 2002 and September 2004, 35% of the deceased patients with PE (55 out of 673) 
died due to malignancy [R09-4887].
In the SWIVTER cited previously, among adult patients with a hospital-diagnosed DVT or 
PE, cancer was an independent predictor of in-hospital death (HR = 5.2; 95% CI: 2.7 - 9.8) 
[R12-5097].
The analysis of a Cancer Registry in US during 1993 to 1995 showed that venous 
thromboembolism was associated with an increased risk of death for all stages and cancer 
types, significant for all but regional and metastatic renal cancer, with a median overall RR of 
3.7 (range of HRs, 1.3 - 14.4) [R11-4358]. In a more recent study, by after 8 years of follow-
up, 55% of the patients with cancer had died [R12-5286].
Co-medication
The prescribed medicines vary by cancer type. No data are available on concomitant use of 
anticancer treatments in the studies cited above.
Hypertension
Incidence and prevalence of hypertension
Hypertension is a common and chronic co-morbidity and therefore is better described by its 
prevalence, see below.
The percentage of hypertension among patients with VTE (n = 6550) in UK during 1994 to 
2000 was 23.33% [P07-06581]. In a case-control study with about 16 000 cases of VTE in 
the UK during 1991 to 2006, the prevalence of hypertension was 26% [R12-5104].
In a cohort study conducted in Denmark during 1977 to 2007, 10% of the patients with VTE 
(n = 97 558) presented hypertension [R11-4532].
The percentage of hypertension among patients with VTE (n = 1897) in US during 1999, 
2001 and 2003 was 52.76% [R11-4370]. In a reanalysis of the same study but including 2005 
data, the prevalence of hypertension was 54.2% [R12-5107].
A non-interventional study conducted in the US including 4557 patients across 6 payor 
databases (IMS, Optum, MSCommercial, MSMedicare, Humana, Medicaid) from 2010 to 
2012 found that more than 50% of patients with DVT and PE had hypertension [R17-1295].
In the NHI database study, among patients aged 18 years or older with a hospital discharge 
diagnosis of VTE (N = 2774) from 01 January through 31 December 2002, the prevalence of 
systemic hypertension was 51.2% [R12-5287].

Mortality of hypertension
There were no data on mortality of hypertension found in the target population.
Co-medication
There were no data on co-medication for hypertension found in the target population.
Coronary artery disease
Incidence and prevalence of coronary artery disease
There were no data on incidence of coronary artery disease found in the target population. 
In a case-control study with around 20 000 cases of VTE in the UK during 1991 to 2006, 
prior myocardial infarction was present in 3.7 % of cases [R12-5104]. In addition, 9.9% of 
cases had a diagnosis code of angina, and almost 10% of the cases presented with prior 
familial history of coronary heart disease.
In the case-control study in the Netherlands, the prevalence of myocardial infarction among 
5000 cases of VTE was 2.8% [R12-5286].
Among patients with VTE in the Worcester Venous Thromboembolism Study (USA), the 
overall prevalence of ischaemic heart disease was 13% [R12-5107]. 
In another publication from the same study, cases of incident VTE identified in 1999, 2001, 
and 2003 (n = 473) were classified with or without concomitant symptomatic atherosclerosis 
(n=1345). Symptomatic atherosclerosis was defined as the presence of prior history of 
ischaemic heart disease, coronary revascularisation procedure, or peripheral arterial disease 
[R12-5114]. Patients with concomitant symptomatic atherosclerosis (26% of the VTE 
patients) were older; more frequently men; and more frequently had hypertension, diabetes, 
heart failure, peripheral arterial disease, myocardial infarction, or ischaemic heart disease 
manifestations and developed VTE during hospitalisation for another condition more often 
than patients without symptomatic atherosclerosis. Among patients with and without 
atherosclerosis, cumulative rates of the following conditions were similar: recurrent DVT 
(13.3% and 16.1%, respectively), PE (4.6% and 5.5%, respectively), in-hospital death (5.5% 
and 4.1%, respectively), death within 30 days of diagnosis (9.5% and 7.5%, respectively) 
were similar. In-hospital major bleeding was higher among patients with symptomatic 
atherosclerosis, 7.6%, than without it, 3.8%.
In a study using data from the NHI database from 01 January through 31 December 2002, the 
prevalence of coronary heart disease was 31.7% among patients aged 18 years or older with a 
hospital discharge diagnosis of VTE (n=2774) [R12-5287].
A US claims-database analysis including 12.7 million patients between January 2002 and 
December 2006 estimated the US prevalence of VTE, and compared the co-morbid condition 
between VTE patients (n=200 007) and non-VTE patients [R11-4373]. The prevalence of

coronary heart disease in VTE patients was 18.3% whereas in non-VTE patients it was 5.3% 
resulting in an adjusted odds ratio (with vs. without VTE) of 1.77 (95% CI: 1.74–1.81).
Mortality of coronary artery disease
The percentage of deaths caused by coronary heart disease was 9.8% among patients with 
VTE (n = 500) in UK during 1994 to 2000 [R11-4409].
During the 3-month follow-up period in a study conducted in the Netherlands between 
November 2002 and September 2004, 16% of the deceased PE patients (55 out of 673) died 
due to a cardiovascular disease [R09-4887].
Co-medication
There were no data on co-medication for coronary artery disease found in the target 
population.
Diabetes mellitus
Incidence and prevalence of diabetes mellitus
Diabetes is a common and chronic co-morbidity and therefore is better described by its 
prevalence, see below.
The percentage of diabetes among patients with VTE (n = 6550) in UK during 1994 to 2000 
was 5.8% [P07-06581]. In a case-control study with about 16 000 cases of VTE in the UK 
during 1991 to 2006, the prevalence of diabetes was 7.5% [R12-5014].
In Sweden during 1997 to 1999, about 19% of the patients with VTE (n = 302) presented 
with diabetes [R11-4529]. However, a study using data from a Swedish registry including 
1247 patients with VTE during the period 2009 to 2010 found a lower prevalence of diabetes, 
9.1% [R12-5097].
In a cohort study conducted in Denmark during 1977 to 2007, 6.7% of the patients with VTE 
(n = 97 558) had diabetes [R11-4532]. In another Danish study, among 15 009 patients 
diagnosed with VTE during 1999 to 2009, the prevalence of diabetes was 7.8% [P11-10351].
The prevalence of diabetes in a cohort study of patients with VTE in the Netherlands was 
3.7% [R12-5286].
In a recent publication of the Worcester Venous Thromboembolism Study, the prevalence of 
diabetes among patients with VTE was 19.1% [R12-5107]. In a study of inpatient data during 
the 1998 to 2008 time period, using the US NIS, the prevalence of diabetes among patients 
admitted for PE was 14.7% [R12-5098].

In the NHI database study among patients aged 18 years or older with a hospital discharge 
diagnosis of VTE (n=2774) from 01 Jan through 31 Dec 2002, the prevalence of diabetes was 
26.4% [R12-5287].
A US claims-database analysis including 12.7 million patients between January 2002 and 
December 2006 estimated the US prevalence of VTE, and compared the co-morbid condition 
between VTE patients (n=200 007) and non-VTE patients [R11-4373]. The prevalence of 
coronary heart disease in VTE patients was 16.5% whereas in non-VTE patients it was 4.4%
resulting in an adjusted odds ratio (with vs. without VTE) of 2.57 (95% CI: 2.52 – 2.63).
A non-interventional study conducted in the US including 4557 patients across 6 payor 
databases (IMS, Optum, MSCommercial, MSMedicare, Humana, Medicaid) from 2010 to 
2012 found that between 11-36% patients with DVT and PE had diabetes.
Mortality of diabetes mellitus
Among patients with diabetes in the Worcester Venous Thromboembolism Study (US), the 
mortality within 30 days of diagnosis was 9.9%. In-hospital death occurred in 6.3% of the 
patients with diabetes [R12-5107].
Co-medication
Among patients with VTE (n = 6550) in the UK during 1994 to 2000, 1.3% were treated with 
insulin and 3.1% were treated with oral antidiabetic drugs [P07-06581]. In the Worcester 
Venous Thromboembolism Study in the US during 1999 to 2005, the same percentages were 
6.3% and 8.7%, respectively [R12-5107].
In Sweden during 1997 to 1999, 43% of the diabetic patients with VTE were being treated 
with insulin, either alone or in combination with oral medication, 25% with oral 
hypoglycemic agents, and 32% with non-pharmacological treatment [R11-4529].
Heart failure
Incidence and prevalence of heart failure
A study conducted in US by combining 2 population-based cohorts from the CHS and ARIC 
study reported that 8% of the patients with DVT and 10% of the patients with PE presented 
with heart failure within 90 days of thrombosis [R05-0358].
In an international multicenter registry of patients with acute VTE (n = 10 114), 5.6% of them 
presented chronic heart failure as an underlying disease [R11-4582].
The percentage of heart failure in patients with VTE (n = 6550) in UK during 1994 to 2000 
was 7.25% [P07-06581].

A Danish, nationwide, population-based, case-control study including 109 752 patients with a 
first-recorded hospitalisation for PE and/or DVT were identified between 1980 and 2007 
[R12-5103]. Among these 3 groups of cases, the prevalence of heart failure within the 
3 months prior to hospitalisation for VTE was 7.3% of those with PE only, 4.2% of those 
with PE and DVT, and 2.2% of those with only DVT. The corresponding figures for history 
of heart failure more than 3 months before the index VTE hospitalisation were 7.9% (PE 
only), 3.6% (PE and DVT), and 3.8% (only DVT). 
In a cohort study in the Netherlands of patients with VTE, the prevalence of heart failure was 
1.2% [R12-5286].
In the multinational, multicenter RIETE-based study, based on data from 
16 199 consecutively enrolled patients with confirmed diagnoses of acute lower limb DVT, 
the prevalence of chronic heart failure was 4%, ranging from 0.1% in patients aged 29 years 
or younger to 10% in patients aged 70 to 79 years [R12-5288].
Among patients with VTE in the Worcester Venous Thromboembolism Study (US), the 
prevalence of heart failure was 17.3% [R12-5107]. Similarly, in the study performed in 
Olmsted County, Minnesota, the prevalence of congestive heart failure among incident VTE 
cases was 18% [R12-5285].
The prevalence of heart failure in patients with VTE in Japan during 1987 to 1999 was 10% 
[R11-4367].
In the NHI database study, among patients aged 18 years or older with a hospital discharge 
diagnosis of VTE (N = 2774) from 01 January through 31 December 2002, the prevalence of 
congestive heart failure was 18.6% [R12-5287].
A US claims-database analysis including 12.7 million patients between January 2002 and 
December 2006 estimated the US prevalence of VTE, and compared the co-morbid condition 
between VTE patients (n=200 007) and non-VTE patients [R11-4373]. The prevalence of 
heart failure in VTE patients was 14.9% whereas in non-VTE patients it was 2.1% resulting 
in an adjusted odds ratio (with vs. without VTE) of 3.23 (95% CI: 3.15 – 3.32).
Mortality of heart failure
In an international multicenter registry of patients with acute VTE (n = 10 114), 0.1% had 
heart failure as underlying cause of death [R11-4582].
Co-medication
There were no data on co-medication for heart failure found in the target population.

Another possible risk factor for paediatric VTE is being overweight or obese, defined as body 
mass indices of 85th-94th and 
95th percentiles, respectively [P19-06500; P19-06504; R19-
2560; R19-2559; R19-2561]. While this is well-characterised in adults, there are minimal 
paediatric-specific data. Being overweight or obese generally is thought to increase VTE risk 
through a chronic low-grade inflammatory state, platelet activation, and endothelial 
dysfunction [R19-2559].
≥ 
Given that VTE is a multifactorial disease in which there are multiple inheritable and 
environmental risk factors that can affect the overall risk of VTE, risk factors to consider 
include deficiencies of antithrombin, protein C and protein S, and gene mutations of factor V 
Leiden (G1691A), prothrombin (factor II G20210A), and methylenetetrahydrofolate 
reductase (MTHFR), hyperhomocysteinemia, elevated lipoprotein(a), congenital heart 
disease, and sickle cell disease [R19-2555; R06-2301; P10-02627; P19-06500; P19-06504; 
R19-2560; P19-06496].

whether to treat and what type of treatment, rather than specific recommended treatments, 
dosage, and durations. These guidelines recommend (1) anticoagulation for symptomatic and 
asymptomatic VTE compared to no anticoagulation, and (2) in catheter-related events, to 
remove the central venous catheter, if feasible. All other therapeutic interventions for PE and 
DVT are suggestions only (e.g. thrombolysis is suggested in cases of massive PE only) [P19-
00949].
Clinical practice guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians for the 
management of VTE in neonates and children include recommendations derived or 
extrapolated from adult data due to the relative lack of data in children. The guidelines are all 
based on low-level evidence (case reports, case series and expert opinion) and also predated 
the availability of newer direct acting oral anticoagulants [P19-00949]. In neonates, therapy 
with LMWH or UFH for 6 weeks to 3 months (with continued prophylaxis if a catheter is still 
in place at the end of therapy) is recommended. Other therapeutic options include supportive 
care only, thrombolytic therapy, and surgical intervention to remove the thrombus; however, 
thrombolytic therapy is not recommended in neonates unless the thrombus is critically 
compromising organs or limbs [P12-03887]. In children with first VTE, anticoagulation with 
either UFH or LMWH is recommended for initial treatment as well as ongoing therapy (6 to 
12 months of treatment are recommended for idiopathic VTE and 3 months of treatment are 
recommended for risk factor-related VTE if the risk is resolved; recommendations for other 
scenarios are described in the guidelines). For those with catheter-related VTE for which the 
catheter cannot be removed, anticoagulation should continue while the catheter is in place. 
For children prescribed a VKA, the suggestion was that the drug be monitored to a target INR 
range of 2.5 (range 2.0-3.0) except in the setting of prosthetic cardiac valves, where 
adherence to the adult recommendations was suggested [P12-03887]. Children with recurrent 
idiopathic VTE should be treated indefinitely with vitamin K antagonists [P12-03887]. 
Thrombolysis is recommended only in limb preserving scenarios. Surgical embolectomy for 
life-threatening thrombi is supported by case reports only [P12-03887].
Draft guidelines from the British Society for Haematology include initiation of therapy with 
LMWHs and following with either warfarin (goal INR 2.5 [range 2.0-3.0]) or continued 
LMWH (particularly in children 1 year of age or younger). Use of UFH in situations where 
rapid reversal may be required is also recommended. Therapy should continue for up to 
3 months in secondary VTE and 6 months in idiopathic VTE. Long term anticoagulation is 
recommended for recurrent idiopathic VTE [P11-13187].

cause mortality risk over a median follow-up time of 8.6 years (IQR 5.1-12.1 years) of 6.7%. 
The mortality rate of VTE was 0.004 per 10 000 person-years (95% CI 0.01, 0.08). The all-
cause 30-day case fatality rate was 4% (95% CI 2.3, 6.7) and the thromboembolism-related 
30-day case fatality rate was 1.6% (95% CI 0.6%, 3.5%). Among neonates, all-cause and 
thromboembolism-related 30-day case fatality rates were 17.1% (95% CI 6.3%, 36.3%) and 
8.6% (95% CI 1.8%, 25.1%), respectively. Of 6 thromboembolism-related deaths, half were 
due to PE [P11-14206].
In another prospective population-based study performed in the Netherlands, among 
99 children aged between 0 to 18 years, the overall all-cause mortality was 15% in the 
neonatal group and 17% in the children younger than 18 years of age [R06-2301].
In a retrospective population-based cohort study in Canada, between 1994 and 2004, among 
518 children aged between 0 and 17 years of age, there were 33 deaths resulting in an overall 
all-cause mortality risk of 6.4%. The mortality rate after incident VTE was 11.4 deaths per 
1000 child-years (95% CI 8.1, 16.1). 21% of deaths occurred in the 30 days after the initial 
VTE diagnosis. Mortality varied by age category, with the highest mortality observed among 
the youngest age group (<1 year olds (33.6 per 1000 children-years [95% CI 12.6, 89.5]) and 
1 to 5 year olds (34.2 per 1000 children-years [95% CI 18.4, 63.5]). Mortality also varied by 
sex; males were 1.32 times more likely to die after the initial VTE diagnosis compared to 
females [R17-1457].
In a retrospective study conducted in Thailand between 1998 and 2015, among 28 neonatal 
hospital admissions with thromboembolism (VTE not specified), there were 3 deaths 
resulting in an overall all-cause mortality risk of 14.3% [P19-06505].

anticoagulant was the only factor among the clinical and laboratory parameters explored that 
was associated with the development of PTS [P17-01686].
Thrombectomy and thrombolysis were used to treat a series of 16 patients aged 11 to 19 years 
(median, 16 years) with proximal DVT who were at high risk for PTS due to acutely 
increased plasma levels of factor VIII and D-dimer at a hospital in the US. During the 1- to 2-
year follow-up, 8 (50%) experienced PTS between 0.5 and 12 months after the DVT; 2 (13%) 
did not experience PTS and follow-up data were not available for 6 patients (37%) [P11-
03999].

organs except the central nervous system. Beside the gastrointestinal tract, the highest 
concentrations of radioactivity were found in the liver and in the urinary tract. The 
radioactivity in tissues decreased rapidly with time. In pregnant rats, only trace amounts of 
radioactivity were detected, suggesting a limited extent of passage across the placenta. In 
pigmented rats no affinity of radioactivity was detectable in the melanin containing parts of 
eye and skin [U00-1096, U02-1372]. The extent of plasma protein binding of BIBR 953 ZW 
was low in all species investigated (mouse, rat, rabbit, Rhesus monkey, and human), ranging 
between 22% and 39% [U00-1294, U06-1211]. In rat plasma, the predominant compound 
was dabigatran, while in Rhesus monkey plasma, the predominant compound were acyl-
glucuronides of dabigatran. In vivo drug metabolism was studied in plasma, urine, faeces, and 
(partly) bile of mouse [U04-1913], rat [U04-1627], rabbit [U04-2115], and Rhesus monkey 
[U04-2009]. Excretion was studied in mouse [U04-1254], rat [U98-2257, U98-2709, U06-
1452 (milk)], rabbit [U05-2451], and Rhesus monkey [U99-1092, U01-1761]. The main route 
of elimination after oral administration of dabigatran etexilate was via faecal excretion in all 
species.

mediated bruising and haemorrhages induced by administration of high doses of dabigatran 
etexilate were noted.
In bleeding-prone rats exposed to high doses of dabigatran etexilate resulting in extremely 
prolonged bleeding times, recurrent haemorrhages accompanied by deposition of fibrin and 
fibroses were induced by the mechanic forces exerted during gavage [U98-2720, U98-2729, 
U05-1378, U03-1310, U04-1864]. The affected organs were the thymus, the pancreas and, in 
a few animals, the heart. The incidence and severity of these findings were significantly 
reduced, when flexible plastic catheters were used instead of steel catheters.
Other side effects (e.g. increase in reticulocyte counts [U98-2729]) were generally mild and 
can be linked directly or indirectly to the exaggerated pharmacological activity of dabigatran 
etexilate at high dose levels. No other significant adverse effects related to the exposure to 
dabigatran etexilate and considered to be toxicologically meaningful were observed.
In Rhesus monkeys, the liability to suffer from haemorrhages was rather low despite 
considerable increases in PT and aPTT [U98-2722, U98-2723]. The evaluation of the 52-
week toxicity study in Rhesus monkeys [U05-1557] did not reveal evidence of other adverse 
effects than already reported for the 26-week toxicity study [U03-1208]. In this species, no 
histological findings comparable to those in rats were observed. All other changes noted in 
Rhesus monkeys were of minor toxicological significance.
In all animal species used in the pre-clinical programme, there was especially no evidence for 
any adverse effects on the liver: long-term usage of ximelagatran, also a direct thrombin 
inhibitor, in clinical trials has been associated with acute hepatocellular toxicity (increases in 
liver transaminases), which was typically observed 1 to 6 months after start of treatment. 
Therefore, the available individual animal data (clinical chemistry, organ weights, gross and 
histopathology) were also analysed in accordance with Step I of the Committee for Medicinal 
Products for Human Use Draft “Guideline on Detection of Early Signals of Drug-Induced 
Hepatotoxicity in non-clinical Studies” from 28 Jun 2006. No early signals of hepatotoxicity 
were detected in either rats or Rhesus monkeys.
Genotoxicity
The genotoxic potential of dabigatran etexilate was assessed in bacterial and mammalian 
systems (Ames, mouse lymphoma, and rat bone marrow micronucleus assay) [U98-2147, 
U99-1063, U98-2789, U99-1023, U05-2047, U01-1161, U05-1295]. Test concentrations 
were selected up to bacterio-/cytotoxic or precipitating concentration levels in the in vitro 
assays and up to maximum tolerated/limit doses under in vivo conditions. In addition, the 
active moiety dabigatran was investigated in the Ames assay. Rat liver S9 fractions from 
Aroclor 1254-induced rats were used as metabolic activation in the in vitro models. The 
Ames and bone marrow micronucleus test were repeated using a mannitol formulation and 
higher dose levels, respectively. In the mouse lymphoma re-test, higher test concentrations 
were examined. Thus, it is concluded that dabigatran etexilate and its active moiety 
dabigatran are not genotoxic.

MODULE SIII  CLINICAL TRIAL EXPOSURE
Estimated cumulative exposure from clinical trials and the enrolment/randomisation schemes 
for completed and ongoing clinical trials are provided in SIII.Table 1 below. Exposure was 
calculated based on the number of subjects randomised that received at least 1 dose of the 
respective trial drug (dabigatran, comparators, placebo). Exposure in the completed trials and 
ongoing trials are added together. For completed trials, the actual enrolment numbers are 
included. For ongoing blinded trials, the randomisation scheme was applied to the number of 
subjects enrolled by the DLP to provide an estimated exposure in each treatment arm.

concomitant verapamil, and DE 110 in other patients. In this analysis of the RE-LY dataset, 
the authors simulated how dabigatran etexilate, when used according to the European label, 
would compare to well-controlled warfarin. In this post-hoc, non-randomised analysis, the 
authors simulated the outcomes of patients receiving dabigatran etexilate with a dose selected 
according to the European label and compared them to the warfarin-treated patients. 
‘European label simulated dabigatran etexilate treatment’ was associated with significant 
reductions in stroke and systemic embolism, haemorrhagic stroke, death and vascular death 
compared to warfarin; also with significant reductions in major and life-threatening bleeding 
and ICH, but not GI major bleeding, compared to warfarin. European label simulated 
dabigatran etexilate outcomes were not significantly different from those of patients receiving 
DE 150 in RE-LY. 
In conclusion, this post-hoc, non-randomised analysis of the RE-LY trial suggests that 
‘European label adherent dabigatran etexilate treatment’ may be associated with superior 
efficacy and safety compared with warfarin.
Causes of death and influencing factors in patients with AF: a competing risk analysis from 
the RE-LY trial 1160-0026 [P13-11205]
The authors analysed the specific causes of death and their predictors among patients with AF 
under effective anticoagulant therapy in the RE-LY trial. All deaths were categorised by the 
investigators using prespecified definitions followed by central adjudication. Overall, 
1371 deaths occurred (annual mortality rate of 3.84%, 95% CI 3.64, 4.05). Cardiac deaths 
(sudden cardiac death and progressive heart failure) accounted for 37.4% of all deaths, 
whereas stroke and haemorrhage-related deaths represented 9.8% of the total mortality. In 
conclusion, the majority of deaths were not related to stroke in a contemporary anticoagulated 
AF population. These results emphasise the need to identify interventions beyond effective 
anticoagulation, to further reduce mortality in AF.

≥80 mL/min had annual major bleeding rates of 1.98% compared with 3.30% in patients with 
eGFR 50 to <80 mL/min and 5.48% in patients with eGFR <50 mL/min. Similarly, the 
incidence of intracranial bleeding increased substantially with worsening renal function 
(0.20%, 0.51%, and 0.69%, respectively). Life-threatening bleedings were 3.2 times higher in 
patients with eGFR <50 mL/min than in subjects with eGFR ≥80 mL/min (2.64% vs. 0.83%, 
respectively). The associations between decreased renal function and increased incidence of 
major, intracranial, and life-threatening bleedings were consistent by all 3 methods of GFR 
estimation. Rates of major bleeding increased with decreasing renal function with dabigatran 
(both doses) and with warfarin.
Conclusion
Rates of stroke, mortality, and major bleeding increase as renal function deteriorates. Relative 
to warfarin, dabigatran etexilate 110 mg b.i.d. and dabigatran etexilate 150 mg b.i.d. 
displayed an efficacy consistent with the overall trial across the range of renal function with 
regard to the primary outcome of stroke or systemic embolism. When GFR was estimated 
with the newer CKD-EPI equation, a significantly greater relative reduction in major 
bleeding risk was displayed for both dosages of dabigatran in patients with eGFR 
≥80 mL/min.
Dabigatran etexilate compared with warfarin in patients with AF and symptomatic heart 
failure: a subgroup analysis of the RE-LY trial (1160-0026) [P13-08160]
The authors evaluated the effects of dabigatran etexilate compared with warfarin in the 
subgroup of patients with previous symptomatic heart failure in the RE-LY trial. RE-LY 
compared 2 fixed and blinded doses of dabigatran etexilate (DE 110 and DE 150) with open 
label warfarin in 18 113 patients with AF at increased risk for stroke. Among 4904 patients 
with heart failure, annual rates of major bleeding were 3.90% for the group on warfarin, 
compared with 3.26% for DE 110 (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.64 - 1.09) and 3.10% for DE 150 (HR 
0.79, 95% CI 0.60 - 1.03). Rates of intracranial bleeding were significantly lower for both 
dabigatran etexilate dosages compared with warfarin in patients with heart failure (DE 110 
vs. warfarin, HR 0.34, 95% CI 0.14, 0.80; DE 150 vs. warfarin, HR 0.39, 95% CI 0.17, 0.89). 
The relative effects of dabigatran etexilate vs. warfarin on the occurrence of stroke or 
systemic embolism and major bleeding were consistent among those with and without heart 
failure and those with low (40%) left ventricular ejection fraction. In conclusion, the overall 
benefits of dabigatran etexilate for stroke/systemic embolism prevention, and major and 
intracranial bleeding, relative to warfarin in the RE-LY trial were consistent in patients with 
and without heart failure.

The aims of this PK analysis of the RE-LY trial were to explore whether there is an 
association between plasma concentrations and outcomes. Also, factors affecting the 
variability of plasma concentrations of dabigatran and their impact on outcome events in AF

trough samples at steady state were collected for determination of drug concentration, aPTT, 
and ECT at 1-month post-randomisation in all dabigatran etexilate subjects regardless of the 
time of any ischaemic or bleeding event that occurred. Additional samples were taken at 3, 6, 
and 12 months from 2143 subjects. Plasma concentrations of nonconjugated (free) dabigatran 
and of total dabigatran were determined by a validated high-performance liquid 
chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method. Logistic regression of events (ischaemic 
stroke/SEE and major and minor bleedings) and associated log-transformed trough plasma 
concentrations was performed with and without covariates. The impact of the covariates age, 
sex, BMI, CrCl, CAD, diabetes mellitus, prior stroke or TIA, hypertension, heart failure, 
CHADS2 score, concomitant aspirin (ASA) use, and concomitant clopidogrel use were 
investigated. Only covariates with p <0.2 were retained. CrCL at baseline was calculated 
using the Cockroft-Gault equation.
Results
Plasma concentrations were obtained from 9183 patients, with 112 ischaemic 
strokes/systemic emboli (1.3%) and 323 major bleedings (3.8%) recorded. Dabigatran levels 
were dependent on renal function, age, weight, and female sex, but not ethnicity, geographic 
region, ASA use, or clopidogrel use. Renal function (CrCl) was a key determinant of plasma 
concentrations. The subjects with moderate renal impairment (between 30 and 50 mL/min 
CrCl) showed a 2.29-fold higher trough concentration than the subjects with renal function 
undiminished by age (CrCl ≥80 ml/min). In the subjects with mild renal impairment (between 
50 and 80 mL/min CrCl), the trough concentrations were 47% higher compared with the 
subjects with CrCl ≥80 mL/min. Concentrations of dabigatran increased with age, with a 68% 
increase in trough concentrations in patients aged ≥75 years compared with those <65 years. 
Renal function was highly correlated with age. 
In the group with subjects who had an MBE during the trial, there were more patients with 
higher plasma levels leading to higher median trough and peak concentration (55% and 36%, 
respectively). Plasma concentrations of dabigatran were higher in subjects with haemorrhagic 
stroke (n=11 with trough and n=13 with peak measurements) than in the subjects (n=8269 
with trough and n=8971 with peak measurements) without haemorrhagic stroke (144 ng/mL 
vs. 78.4 ng/mL for trough and 241 ng/mL vs. 155 ng/mL for post-dose concentrations, 
respectively; p>0.05). Multiple logistic regression (c-statistic 0.715, 95% CI: 0.69, 0.74) 
showed major bleeding risk increased with dabigatran exposure (p<0.0001), age (p<0.0001), 
ASA use (p< 0.0003), and diabetes (p=0.018) as significant covariates.
Discussion
In this exposure response analysis from the 1160-0026 trial, the risks of major bleeding after 
dosing with dabigatran etexilate 110 mg b.i.d. or dabigatran etexilate 150 mg b.i.d. in patients 
with AF were related to several factors mainly including age, CrCl, and trough concentrations 
of dabigatran. Trough plasma concentrations increased approximately 67% in patients aged

years was 39% higher than in patients <75 years. Despite increased rates of major bleeding 
with decreasing renal function in dabigatran etexilate patients, the RR of bleeding compared 
to warfarin did not change, suggesting that age and other factors in addition to anticoagulant 
effect or exposure play a role in the increased risk of stroke and bleeding seen in patients with 
renal dysfunction. In patients with risk factors for bleeding such as old age, reduced CrCl, or 
low body weight, better outcomes might be achieved by adjusting the dose. Across the 10th 
to 90th percentile range of steady-state trough plasma concentrations achieved for the 150 mg 
b.i.d. dose, the overall risk of major bleeding during the trial ranges from approximately 2%
to 7% (approximately 1.0% to 3.5% per year), with substantial impact of age and 
concomitant antiplatelet use, with sex, history of diabetes, and CAD also significant 
covariates in the model. Older patients, those with multiple co-morbidities, or those with 
reduced renal function may be appropriate candidates for a lower dose such as 110 mg b.i.d. 
The large majority of patients achieve a favourable balance of benefit and risk with a fixed 
dose of dabigatran etexilate 110 mg b.i.d. or dabigatran etexilate 150 mg b.i.d. guided by a 
consideration of patient characteristics. This study has several limitations. Although the 
association of clinical outcomes with dabigatran concentrations was prespecified in the main 
study protocol, not all patients randomised to dabigatran etexilate contributed a blood sample. 
This may have introduced bias. There was no temporal proximity of PK sampling and time of 
event. Medication compliance was not assessed in this analysis, which may introduce 
additional variability. Thus, intra-individual variability in plasma concentrations over time 
may blur the associations between dabigatran concentration and outcomes.
Conclusion
In this 1160-0026 sub-study, specific demographic characteristics such as very elderly and/or 
poor renal function played the strongest role in determining risk of clinical events. Renal 
function was the predominant patient characteristic that determined plasma concentrations. 
There is no single plasma concentration range that provides optimal benefit-risk for all 
patients. The balance between stroke risk and bleeding risk was affected by several factors 
including plasma concentration. There might be a subset of AF patients who may improve 
their benefit–risk balance with dabigatran etexilate by a tailoring of the dose in relation to 
patient characteristics. Results from this targeted review of selected RE-LY data triggered the 
CCDS update to version 13 (dated 16 Sep 2014) and are included in the CCDS sections “side 
effects“ as well as “Pharmacological properties“. The EU-SmPC was updated accordingly 
(EMEA/H/C/000829/II/0073).
Additional clinical trials were performed to gain information on long-term effects of 
dabigatran and on the use of dabigatran in patients with AF who underwent PCI or ablation. 
These trials are presented below in ascending order.

‘haemorrhage’, ‘hepatotoxicity’, ‘myocardial infarction’ and ‘pulmonary embolism’. Subjects 
remained on the randomised doses from RE-LY and continued double-blind treatment for up 
to 43 months. A total of 5883 subjects were treated, 2927 in the DE 110 group and 2956 were 
in the DE 150 group. As the objective of RELY-ABLE was safety, there were no primary 
efficacy endpoints. Secondary endpoints were stroke (including haemorrhagic), non-central 
nervous system systemic embolism, PE, acute MI, DVT, and all deaths (includes deaths from 
bleeding). All categories of bleeding generally occurred more frequently in the DE 150 group 
compared to the DE 110 group during RELY-ABLE. The risk of major bleedings was 
significantly lower for DE 110 treatment (0.77, 95% [CI] (0.64, 0.93) p=0.0055).  For the 
RE-LY plus RELY-ABLE period, DE 110 and DE 150 had major bleeding rates of 2.08% 
and 2.49%, respectively. During the RELY-ABLE period, life-threatening bleedings, 
intracerebral haemorrhage, and major GI bleedings were consistent with the rates in RELY 
and were numerically lower for the DE 110 group. Similar patterns in the rates were shown in 
the RE-LY plus RELY-ABLE period, although the overall event rates were lower. DE 110 
and 1.36% for DE 150. Haemorrhagic stroke was similar between the 2 groups and occurred 
at an annualised rate of 0.14% for DE 110 and 0.14% for DE 150. Renal dysfunction was 
associated with a higher risk of major bleeding for both treatments across the CrCl ranges 
evaluated. In all categories (except for CrCl <30 mL/min), the annualised rate for major 
bleeding was higher for subjects treated with DE 150 compared to DE 110. There were too 
few subjects with CrCl <30 mL/min to draw conclusions.
Haemorrhagic stroke was similar between the 2 groups and occurred at an annualised rate of 
0.14% for DE 110 and 0.14% for DE 150.
During the RELY-ABLE period, reported SAEs were generally similar for both treatment 
groups. The reported incidence of SAEs was 35.3% and 37.7%, for DE 110 and DE 150, 
respectively.
Summary
The RE-LY extension study (RELY-ABLE) provided additional safety information for a 
large cohort of patients that continued the same dose of dabigatran etexilate as assigned in the 
RE-LY trial. During the additional 2.5 years of treatment in RELY-ABLE, with a maximum 
exposure of over 6 years (total exposure in RELY + RELY-ABLE), the long-term safety 
profile of dabigatran etexilate was confirmed for both test doses. No new safety findings were 
observed. The rates of outcome events, including major bleedings and other bleeding events, 
were consistent with those seen in RE-LY.
The trial 1160-0071 (RE-LY-ABLE) further supported the evaluations from the trial 1160-
0026 (RE-LY). During more than 2.5 additional years of follow-up after trial 1160-0026 (RE-
LY), rates of ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke, and of major bleedings, on dabigatran 
etexilate 110 mg b.i.d. and on dabigatran etexilate 150 mg b.i.d. were consistent with the 
event rates reported during the trial 1160-0026 (RE-LY); providing evidence for long-term 
efficacy and safety of dabigatran etexilate in subjects with AF not caused by a heart valve 
problem at risk for stroke and blood clots. The risk of major bleedings was significantly 
lower for dabigatran etexilate 110 mg b.i.d. Annualised rates for major bleeding were 2.79%

pulmonaRy vein ablation: assessment of an uninterrupted periproCedUral antIcoagulation 
sTrategy (The RE-CIRCUIT Trial) [c14388942-01; P17-03137]
The primary objective of this trial was to assess the safety of an uninterrupted dabigatran 
etexilate periprocedural anticoagulant regimen compared with an uninterrupted 
periprocedural warfarin regimen in NVAF patients undergoing ablation of AF in a PROBE 
(Prospective, randomised, open label, blinded end point) active controlled trial. 
Secondary objectives were to assess additional safety endpoints and efficacy in this clinical 
setting. A total of 704 patients were enrolled in the trial. Of these, 678 patients were 
randomised and 676 were treated, and 26 were screening failures. Of the treated patients, 
635 patients started the ablation procedure. The following text summarises the disposition, 
compliance, and patient characteristics based on the ablation set.
Primary endpoint
Treatment with DE resulted in a statistically significant reduction of the occurrence of ISTH 
MBEs compared with warfarin treatment in the patients in the ablation set (exploratory 
analysis). The frequency of MBEs was 1.6% in the DE group and 6.9% in the warfarin group 
(see table below). The risk difference was -5.3% (95% CI -8.4, -2.2%). The HR of DE vs. 
warfarin based on the unstratified Cox proportional hazards model was 0.224 (95% CI 0.08, 
0.59). Analyses of the primary endpoint in a variety of subgroups by demographics, baseline 
characteristics, and type of ablation showed results that were generally consistent with the 
results for the overall population.

Secondary endpoints of safety
The composite endpoint of ISTH MBE/SSE/TIA occurred more frequently in the warfarin 
group during the ablation procedure and up to 2 months post-ablation (SVII.Table 14). This 
result was driven by the treatment imbalance seen for MBEs. There were similar frequencies 
of minor bleedings in both treatment groups. Subgroup analyses of the secondary endpoints 
showed results that were consistent with those for the overall population.

warfarin group. The frequencies of any bleeding events as reported by the investigator (non-
adjudicated data) were identical in the DE and warfarin groups (12 patients, 20.0% for each 
group; 95% CI: 10.8, 32.3).
New ICH or worsening of the haemorrhagic components of a previous lesion were similar in 
the 2 groups: 1 patient (1.8%; 95% CI: 0.0, 9.6) in the DE group; 2 patients (3.8%; 95% CI: 
0.5, 13.0) in the warfarin group.
In assessments of recanalisation, 33/55 DE patients with data and 35/52 warfarin patients 
with data showed an improvement in total occlusion scores from baseline to end of treatment.
The frequency of AEs was 78.3% in the DE group and 70.0% in the warfarin group. In the 
DE group, the most frequently reported AEs by MedDRA SOC were GI disorders (30.0%), 
nervous system disorders (28.3%), infections and infestations (15.0%), and respiratory, 
thoracic and mediastinal disorders (10.0%). In total, 7 patients (11.7%) in the DE group 
experienced AEs leading to discontinuation of trial medication compared with no patient in 
the warfarin group. All AEs leading to discontinuation of trial medication were each reported 
for only a single patient (7 patients in total [1.7%]) in the DE group, as follows (note, patients 
could have more than 1 AE leading to discontinuation): abdominal discomfort, ALT 
increased, AST increased, cerebral haemorrhage, cerebral infarction, epigastric discomfort, 
gastrointestinal necrosis, intracranial venous sinus thrombosis, intestinal haematoma, 
thrombocytopenia, urticaria, and vomiting. SAEs were reported for 13.3% of patients on DE 
and 10.0% on warfarin. There were no fatal AEs in either treatment group. The most frequent 
SAEs by MedDRA SOC were nervous system disorders, reported for 5 (8.3%) patients on 
DE vs. 1 (1.7%) on warfarin.
Based on the frequency of major bleedings or venous thrombosis, there were no clinically 
noteworthy differences comparing the net clinical benefit of oral DE vs. oral warfarin in 
patients with cerebral venous and dural sinus thrombosis over a 24-week treatment period. 
Results from this trial were published by Ferro et al in 2019 [P19-07958].

In total, 4199 patients were treated with either dabigatran etexilate 150 mg b.i.d., warfarin, or 
placebo for up to 36 or 18 months. Fewer patients with haemorrhages were reported in the 
dabigatran etexilate 150 mg b.i.d. treatment group than in the warfarin treatment group: 
MBEs 0.9% vs. 1.8%, MBEs/CRBE 5.6% vs. 10.2% and any haemorrhagic event 19.4% vs. 
26.2%. The difference between treatment groups was statistically significant for 
MBEs/CRBE and any haemorrhagic events (p<0.0001). Compared with placebo, more 
patients in the dabigatran etexilate 150 mg b.i.d. group were reported with haemorrhagic 
events: MBEs 0.3% vs. none, MBEs/CRBE 5.3% vs. 2.0% and any haemorrhagic event

reconstitution solution. The assessment of safety and tolerability was an additional objective 
of this trial. Deaths, SAEs, other significant AEs according to ICH E3, AEs of special 
interest, or severe AEs were not reported in this study and there were no AEs leading to trial 
discontinuation. 
7 subjects experienced a total of 9 drug-related AE. 5 of the 9 drug-related AEs concerned 
events of bleeding (2 cases of haematoma, 2 of epistaxis, and 1 of haemorrhage), 2 were GIS 
(vomiting and diarrhoea), and 2 were headache. All drug-related AEs had recovered, except 
for 1 AE (haematoma), which was not yet recovered by the end of the study, but was 
expected to recover without sequelae.
Multiple 150 mg doses of dabigatran etexilate administrated as pellets on food (T1), granules 
resolved in reconstitution solution (T2), or as hard capsules (R) were safe and well tolerated 
by the healthy subjects. The trial results did not provide new relevant safety findings.
Results from this trial triggered the CCDS update to version 15 (dated 5 May 2015) and are 
included in the CCDS section “Pharmacokinetics”. The EU-SmPC has been updated 
accordingly (EMEA/H/C/000829/II/0080).

3 days at the end of standard anticoagulant therapy in children aged 12 years to less than 
18 years [U12-3378-01]
Trial 1160-0088, which assessed safety in adolescents, has been completed. In this trial, the 
PK and PD of dabigatran etexilate administered b.i.d. for 3 consecutive days (total 6 doses) 
were assessed in 8 stable adolescents (12 to <18 years). All patients received an initial oral 
dose of 1.71 mg/kg (± 10%) of dabigatran etexilate (80% of the adult dose of 150 mg/70 kg 
adjusted for the patient's weight). Based on dabigatran concentrations as determined by the 
diluted thrombin time test and clinical assessment, the dose was adjusted to the target dose of 
2.14 mg/kg (± 10%) of dabigatran etexilate (100% of the adult dose adjusted for the patient's 
weight). In this small population of patients, dabigatran etexilate capsules were well tolerated 
with only 3 mild and transient gastrointestinal adverse events reported by 2 patients. 
Exposure in this adolescent population was slightly lower compared to the exposure seen in 
adults. However, the PK/PD relationship in this population was similar to the relationship 
seen in adult VTE patients.

18 patients who were entered into the study were treated with dabigatran etexilate. All 
6 patients aged 1 to <2 years who entered the study were treated with a single dose of 
dabigatran etexilate. In the age group of 2 to <12 years, 9 entered patients received a single 
dose of dabigatran etexilate and 3 entered patients were treated with a multiple dose of 
dabigatran etexilate (3 days, b.i.d.). None of the 18 treated patients prematurely discontinued 
the trial medication or the trial. The dose was adjusted based on age and weight and was 
equivalent to the adult dose of 150 mg dabigatran etexilate (multiple dose, 3 days b.i.d.), with 
80% of the paediatric target dose for dose 1 on day 1, followed by 100% of the target dose for 
all subsequent 5 doses. Single dose on 1 day (100% of the target dose).
All 6 patients in the single dose group aged 1 to <2 years were treated with the planned single 
dose of dabigatran etexilate which was adjusted based on age and weight of the individual 
patient. In the single dose group aged 2 to <12 years, 7 patients received their planned single 
dose of dabigatran etexilate and 2 patients received less than the planned dose but more than 
the minimum required dose. All 3 patients in the multiple dose group were to receive 80% of 
the target dose on dose 1, followed by 100% for all subsequent 5 doses. Of these 3 patients, 
2 patients received the planned dose with very minor deviations in volume and 1 patient 
received a higher volume for all 6 doses (Dose 1: 4.96 mL instead of 4.4 mL; Doses 2 to 6: 
6.24 mL instead of 5.4 mL).
Adverse events
A total of 3 patients (16.7%) in this study had AEs during screening (respiratory tract 
infection, nasopharyngitis, ear pain, and back pain) and 1 patient (5.6%) had AEs during the 
on-treatment period (leukopenia and dizziness). All AEs were of mild intensity, non-serious 
and considered to be not related to study drug intake in the opinion of the investigator; all 
patients recovered. None of the patients had a VTE during this study.
There were no AEs during the post-treatment or post-study periods. There were no deaths, no 
AEs leading to discontinuation of trial drug, no drug-related AEs (in the opinion of the 
investigator), no AEs of special interest, and no other significant AEs according to ICH E3 at 
any time of the trial.
Bleeding events
During the entire study, no bleeding events were reported for the 20 screened patients.
Laboratory assessment and vital signs
Laboratory analyses (haematology and clinical chemistry) did not reveal any clinically 
significant findings compared to baseline. Regarding transitions relative to the reference 
range, no clinically relevant or unexpected findings were observed for any of the measured 
parameters. Regarding vital signs, there were no clinically meaningful findings or changes 
from baseline to each measured time point in blood pressure or pulse rate values.

1160-0105 Open-label, single dose, tolerability, pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamics and 
safety study of dabigatran etexilate given at the end of standard anticoagulant therapy in 
children aged less than 1 year old [c09085437-01]
Trial 1160-0105 is an open-label, single dose, tolerability, PK/PD and safety study of 
dabigatran etexilate given at the end of standard anticoagulant therapy in children aged less 
than 1 year old. Dabigatran etexilate oral liquid formulation (6.25 mg/mL) after reconstitution 
from dabigatran etexilate granules (167.5 mg) and solvent for oral liquid formulation (26 mL 
out of 30 mL provided in solvent bottle, dose: adjusted based on age and weight).
A total of 10 patients were screened / enrolled. Of these, 2 patients were screening failures. 
All 8 patients who were entered into the study were treated with dabigatran etexilate. None of 
the 8 patients prematurely discontinued the trial medication or prematurely discontinued the 
trial.
All 8 patients who were entered into the study were treated with a single dose of dabigatran 
etexilate which was adjusted based on their age and weight. All 8 patients received at least 
the minimum required dose. Of these, 2 patients received slightly less than the planned dose 
(5.5 mL instead of 6.0 mL; 2.5 mL instead of 3.0 mL) and 1 patient received slightly more 
than the planned dose (4.0 mL instead of 3.0 mL).
Adverse events
During screening and the on-treatment period, none of the patients were documented with 
any AE. There were no deaths, no AEs leading to discontinuation of trial drug, no drug-
related AEs (in the opinion of the investigator), no AEs of special interest, and no other 
significant AEs according to ICH E3 at any time of the trial.
During the post-treatment period, 1 of 8 patients (12.5%) was documented with an SAE 
(preferred term aortic stenosis, system organ class vascular disorders). The event was of 
severe intensity, not drug related according to the investigator, was immediately life-
threatening, and required/prolonged hospitalisation. The SAE occurred 7 days after intake of 
dabigatran etexilate.
Bleeding events
During the entire study, no bleeding events were reported for the 10 screened patients.
Global assessment of acceptability and tolerability of the study medication 
The majority of patients were assessed with ‘good’ tolerability (6 patients, 75.0%). 1 patient 
each (12.5%) was evaluated with a satisfactory tolerability or tolerated the study medication 
badly.
Conclusion
In this small population of infants (children aged less than 1 year), dabigatran etexilate as oral 
liquid formulation was well tolerated without AEs or bleeding events during the on-treatment 
period. The 1 reported SAE (aortic stenosis), occurred 7 days after taking dabigatran etexilate 
and was not considered related to study medication by the investigator.

The variability of total dabigatran plasma concentrations was moderate at 2 hours after 
dosing and low at 12 hours after dosing. The projected steady-state dabigatran trough 
concentrations of the present study were largely comparable to those observed in adult 
patients with VTE. The relationships between total dabigatran concentration and ECT or dTT 
were linear; the PK/PD relationship for aPTT can be described by a non-linear model. The 
observed PK/PD relationships in this study were similar to those observed in adult and 
adolescent patients with VTE.
Phase IIb/III studies
1160-0106 Open-label, randomised, parallel-group, active-controlled, multicentre,non-
inferiority study of dabigatran etexilate [DE] versus standard of care for venous 
thromboembolism treatment in children from birth to less than 18 years of age: The 
DIVERSITY study [c29773859-01, P20-11143]
This study is an active-controlled, open-label, randomised, parallel-group trial for treatment 
of paediatric VTE. Clinically stable patients diagnosed with acute VTE who had completed 
an initial parenteral treatment with an unfractionated or a low molecular weight heparin for a 
minimum of 5 to 7 days (but not longer than 21 days) and who had an anticipated need for 
continued anticoagulation therapy for at least 3 months (including the initial parenteral 
therapy) were eligible to enter the study. Patients aged ≥8 years received age- and weight-
adjusted DE dosing via capsules using 50 mg, 75 mg, 110 mg, and 150 mg doses. For 
patients aged <8 years or for patients who cannot take capsules even if older than 8 (but 
<12 years of age) there was age- and weight-adjusted dosing via DE pellets. Patients aged 
<12 months received age- and weight-adjusted dosing via DE oral liquid formulation. There 
was a 2:1 randomisation to DE vs. standard of care. Investigators decided on SoC treatment 
at the time of randomisation: either LMWH, VKA, or fondaparinux. Study treatment was 
planned for 3 months which included the initial parenteral therapy. Outcome events were 
adjudicated by an independent blinded adjudication committee. 
Overall, 267 patients entered the trial and 266 were treated. Of those, 176 patients were 
treated with dabigatran etexilate and 90 patients according to standard of care. 168 patients 
were 12 to <18 years old, 64 patients 2 to <12 years old, and 35 patients were younger than 
2 years. Of those, 21 patients were 6 months to <2 years old and 14 patients were <6 months 
old.
The frequency of bleeding events (major, minor, CRNM, or any bleeding event) was 
generally comparable between treatment groups. In total, 38 patients (21.6%) in the DE arm 
and 22 patients (24.4%) in the standard of care arm had any adjudication-confirmed bleeding 
event, most of them categorised as minor. The rate difference for the probability of freedom 
from any bleeding event and the HR of events showed that there was no difference in risk of 
any bleeding events between the 2 treatment groups. The combined endpoint of adjudication-
confirmed MBE or CRNM was reported for 6 (3.4%) patients in the DE group and 3 (3.3%) 
patients in the standard of care group. In 2019, Albisetti et. al. presented this study at the 27th 
Congress of the ISTH [P19-06030]

1160-0108 Open label, single arm safety prospective cohort study of dabigatran etexilate for 
secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism in children from 0 to less than 18 years 
[c29754273-01, P19-11322]
Trial 1160-0108 was a multi-centre, multinational, open-label, single arm phase III trial of 
DE to evaluate safety in the secondary prevention of VTE in children from 0 to <18 years. 
Recruitment was first initiated in the adolescent group (12 to <18 years) and was 
consecutively opened to younger age groups (2 to <12 years of age; 0 to <2 years). This trial 
included patients who required further anticoagulation due to the presence of a clinical risk 
factor after completing the initial treatment for confirmed VTE (for at least 3 months) or after 
completing the DIVERSITY trial. Patients with active meningitis, encephalitis, or intracranial 
abscess were excluded from trials 1160-0106 and 1160-0108 due to the potential for ICH in 
this patient population [c26571231-01, c26496086-01].
Eligible patients received age and weight adjusted doses of an age-appropriate formulation 
(capsules, coated granules or oral solution) of dabigatran etexilate until the clinical risk factor 
resolved, or up to a maximum of 12 months. The primary endpoints of the study included the 
recurrence of VTE, major and minor bleeding events, and mortality (overall and related to 
thrombotic or thromboembolic events) at 6 and 12 months. Outcome events were adjudicated 
by an independent blinded adjudication committee. 
214 patients entered the study and 213 were treated.The mean age at screening was 
12.8 years (SD 4.6 years), with 161 patients in the 12 to <18 years age group, 43 patients in 
the 2 to <12 years age group, and 9 patients in the 0 to 2 years age group. The youngest 
patient was 6 months old.
During the on-treatment period, 3 patients (1.4%) had an adjudication-confirmed recurrent 
VTE within the first 12 months after treatment start. The overall probability of being free 
from recurrence of VTE during the on-treatment period was 0.984 (95% CI 0.950, 0.995) at 
6 months and 0.984 (95% CI 0.950, 0.995) at 12 months. 
In 3 patients (1.4%), an adjudication-confirmed major bleeding event occurred within the first 
12 months. 3 patients (1.4%) had an adjudication-confirmed clinically relevant non-major 
bleeding within the first 12 months. Overall, adjudication-confirmed bleeding events (major, 
minor, and clinically relevant non-major bleeding) during the ontreatment period were 
reported for 48 patients (22.5%) within the first 12 months. The probability of being free 
from bleeding events was 0.785 (95% CI 0.718, 0.838) at 6 months and 0.723 (95% CI 0.645, 
0.787) at 12 months.
No on-treatment deaths occurred. The safety profile of DE was consistent with the known 
profile of the drug, and no new safety signal for DE has been identified. In 2019, Brandao et. 
al published a manuscript based on an interim data snapshot from this trial [P19-11322].

Special populations
Renal impairment
1160-0086: An open label, non-comparative, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study 
to evaluate the effect of dabigatran etexilate on coagulation parameters including a 
calibrated thrombin time test in patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine 
clearance 30-50 mL/min) undergoing primary unilateral elective total knee or hip 
replacement surgery [c01954741-02]
The 1160-0086 study, a phase IV, multi-centre, multi-national study in patients with 
moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30-50 mL/min) undergoing TKR or THR was a PK/PD 
study to compare the estimated dabigatran etexilate concentration in plasma measured by 
local/central calibrated Hemoclot Thrombin Inhibitor assay with the concentration measured 
in a central laboratory via HPLC-MS/MS. The study also evaluated the correlation between 
total dabigatran etexilate plasma concentration and coagulation parameters using Hemoclot, 
aPTT, and ECT. This study confirmed that Hemoclot is an adequate assay to estimate 
dabigatran concentrations and is comparable with the HPLC-MS/MS reference method in the 
calibrated range of approximately 50 to 500 ng/mL, if adequately calibrated.
Safety data from the 112 patients who received trial medication included bleeding events for 
20 patients (17.9%), most of which occurred at the surgical site; only few patients (n=5; 
4.5%) experienced gastrointestinal bleeding. More than half of the bleeding events were 
classified as clinically relevant; MBEs were reported for only 4 (3.6%) patients. One third of 
the patients received blood transfusions as surgical routine and only 12 patients due to other 
bleeding events or reasons. None of the treated patients had a thromboembolic event. 
4 patients (3.6%) were reported with signs of DVT, but none of these were confirmed as 
DVT.
The most common AEs were nausea, vomiting, and arthralgia; AEs leading to 
discontinuation were most frequently reported in the SOC ‘GI disorders’ including gastric 
ulcer and haematemesis. The most frequently reported drug-related AEs were haematoma and 
wound haematoma. Most AEs were mild or moderate in intensity; only 7 patients (6.3%) had 
AEs that were assessed as severe. SAEs were reported for 10 patients during treatment with 
dabigatran etexilate; 6 SAEs were considered to be related to the study drug by the 
investigator and led to treatment discontinuation (diverticulitis, gastritis haemorrhagic, and 
2 cases each of gastric ulcer and haematemesis); 1 SAE was fatal (acute MI).
The overall profile of AEs was expected in this population of patients with advanced age 
(mean age 79.1 years). The safety profile of dabigatran etexilate in patients who underwent 
THR or TKR was consistent with the safety profile as described in the current Pradaxa EU-
SmPC.

1160-0121: Open label, non-randomized, multiple dose phase I study to investigate the 
elimination, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety of dabigatran etexilate 
(Pradaxa) under steady state conditions before, during and after haemodialysis in patients 
with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) undergoing regular haemodialysis [U11-2257-01]
The aim of this study was to assess effects of 2 different haemodialysis procedures on PK, 
PD, and elimination rate of dabigatran in subjects with ESRD. In each trial period, dabigatran 
etexilate was administered on days 1, 2, and 3, and haemodialysis was performed on days 1, 
3, and 5. During haemodialysis on day 3, target rate of blood flow was 200 mL/min in 
treatment period 1 and 400 mL/min in treatment period 2. Dabigatran etexilate doses for 
these subjects were selected to obtain plasma concentrations of dabigatran comparable to 
steady-state concentrations in typical patients treated b.i.d. with 150 mg of dabigatran 
etexilate. 
7 subjects with ESRD were included. All 7 subjects entered in the trial completed the planned 
observation time for the trial; no important protocol violations or violations of 
inclusion/exclusion criteria were identified for any subject.
The dosing scheme employed for subjects with ESRD resulted in gMean maximum plasma 
levels of dabigatran on day 3 (after the third dose of dabigatran etexilate) that were similar to 
those observed at steady state in patients with normal renal clearance receiving 150 mg of 
dabigatran etexilate b.i.d. In subjects with ESRD, however, geometric mean predose 
concentrations of dabigatran were substantially higher (40 to 55%) due to reduced clearance 
in these subjects.
Haemodialysis clearly resulted in marked decreases in plasma concentrations of both free and 
total dabigatran. Increasing the blood flow rate during Day 3 dialysis (from 200 mL/min in 
treatment period 1 to almost 400 mL/min in treatment period 2) increased dialysis clearance 
of total dabigatran from blood and plasma by approximately 50% and the fraction of 
dabigatran removed from plasma by 20%. In treatment period 1, individual fractions of 
dabigatran removed from plasma ranged from 41.3% to 58.0%; in treatment period 2, values 
ranged from 54.3% to 64.9%.
In both treatment periods, pharmacodynamic assessment indicated that aPTT and anti-FIIa 
increased after administration of dabigatran etexilate, and that dialysis reduced aPTT and 
anti-FIIa times. The presence of heparin during dialysis affected the aPTT ratio, whereas the 
anti-FIIa ratio was not affected by heparin. 
In both treatment periods, all 7 subjects received all 3 planned doses of dabigatran. No 
deaths, serious AEs, other significant AEs, or AEs of severe intensity were reported. Over the 
course of the trial, AEs were reported for 2 subjects (28.6%). During dabigatran treatment, 
mild epistaxis was reported in 1 subject. It was considered by the investigator as minor 
bleeding and as related to trial medication. Other AEs reported were mild headache for one 
subject during dabigatran treatment and one subject experienced mild nasopharyngitis for the 
6-week washout period between treatment periods. Neither of these AEs was considered 
treatment-related by the investigator. All 3 AEs resolved without concomitant therapy.

During haemodialysis on day 3, heparin was administered at half the normal dose due to 
subjects’ concomitant exposure to dabigatran. No bleeding-related AEs and no coagulation-
related dialysis complications were reported for subjects receiving low-dose heparin.
No relevant elevations in ALT or AST were observed. No transitions in individual clinical 
laboratory values were of clinical relevance or reported as an AE by the investigator. The 
investigator assessed tolerability of trial treatment as 'good' for all 7 subjects.
Conclusion
The dosing scheme for subjects with ESRD produced gMean maximum plasma levels of 
dabigatran on day 3 that were similar to steady state levels in patients with normal renal 
clearance receiving 150 mg of dabigatran etexilate b.i.d. The haemodialysis procedures 
employed in the trial resulted in substantial clearance of total plasma dabigatran. Dialysis 
clearance of dabigatran was higher for higher dialysis blood flow rates. Dialysis was also 
successful in reducing the pharmacodynamic effect of dabigatran. Treatment was well-
tolerated, and safety analysis did not indicate a safety risk for subjects with ESRD 
participating in the trial.
1160-0166: “An exploratory study to investigate the PK and effects of DABIgatran etexilate 
in patients with stable severe RENAL disease: DabiRenal” [c02161791-02]
This open-label, single centre trial was performed in patients with a chronic need for 
anticoagulation and concomitant severe CKD (as defined by a CrCl between 15 and 
30 mL/min over the last 3 months before trial participation) to evaluate the PK and PD of 
dabigatran etexilate, based on the FDA exposure response model. A total of 16 patients 
received 75 mg dabigatran etexilate (1 capsule) b.i.d. for 7.5 days (corresponding to a total of 
15 capsules). 
The primary PK endpoints Cmax,ss and AUCtau,ss (=AUC0-12,ss) had geometric mean values of 
207 ng/mL (gCV of 53.9%, N=15) and 2140 ng*h/mL (gCV of 51.9% N=15), respectively. 
The observed total exposure (AUC) is similar to the gMean AUC0-∞ of 2460 ng*h/mL seen 
in subjects with CrCl from 30 to 50 mL/min after receiving a single dose of 150 mg DE in 
trial 1160-0023 [U06-1704], which demonstrated that 75 mg DE b.i.d. is the appropriate 
dosing regimen when targeting the exposure levels seen in patients with moderate renal 
impairment receiving 150 mg DE b.i.d. As expected, prolonged elimination of dabigatran in 
subjects with severe renal impairment was shown by an increase in terminal half-life with a 
gMean t1/2,ss of 28.3 hours (gCV: 13.0%) compared to t1/2,ss values of 14 to 17 hours in 
healthy volunteers. This observation is also consistent with the previously reported half-life 
of 27.2 hours in patients with severe renal impairment [U06 1704]. Overall, twice daily 
administration of 75 mg dabigatran etexilate for 7.5 days was safe and well tolerated by the 
subjects with severe CKD in this trial.
No clinically relevant finding was reported as an AE regarding safety laboratory 
measurements, ECG recordings, physical examinations, and vital sign measurements. No

bleeding event was reported as an AE, but 1 AE (wound) led to a minor bleeding, which 
lasted 30 to 45 min and did not require any therapy.
1160-0173: A prospective, open label study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of dabigatran 
in non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) patients with severely impaired renal function on 
dabigatran etexilate 75 mg b.i.d. therapy [c04596002-01]:
This trial was conducted to assess dabigatran exposure (at trough and peak) in NVAF patients 
with severe renal impairment (defined as CrCl 15-30 mL/min) receiving dabigatran etexilate 
75 mg b.i.d. therapy.
60 patients were treated with Pradaxa and 59 (98.3%) of these patients completed the planned 
observation time. No patient prematurely discontinued from the trial medication. 1 patient 
was treated but died in the post-treatment phase and the termination visit was not done. All 
60 patients received at least 12 doses of trial drug and were therefore were included in the 
pharmacokinetic set and pharmacokinetic modelling set. There were no important protocol 
violations in this trial.
Pharmacokinetics – primary endpoints:
B.i.d. administration of 75 mg dabigatran etexilate in patients with severe renal impairment 
resulted in a gMean Cpre,ss of 155 ng/mL (gCV of 76.9%) and gMean C2,ss of 202 ng/mL
(gCV of 70.6%) on Day 8 (Visit 3).
Observed plasma concentrations were predicted reasonably well by the RE-LY population 
PK model, although with a tendency towards under-prediction of median and higher 
concentrations. When only accounting for between-patient variability, there was also a 
tendency to over-predict the 10th concentration percentile.
Summary of AEs
Overall, 11/60 (18.3%) patients in this trial had at least 1 AE during the treatment period 
through 3 days after the last drug intake of the treatment period. 1 patient (1.7%) had a severe 
AE (acute MI). A total of 4 (6.7%) patients had AEs that were considered to be drug-related. 
No patients had AEs leading to premature discontinuation of trial drug or significant AEs 
(significant according to ICH E3). There were no pre-specified events outlined in the protocol 
for this trial. 2 patients reported SAEs during the treatment period that required 
hospitalisation (one of which was also considered to be immediately life-threatening). No 
deaths were reported during the treatment period through 3 days after the last drug intake of 
the treatment period. 1 death of a patient was reported in the post-treatment phase.
Bleeding events
Bleeding events were reported in a total of 5 patients during the trial. All bleeding events 
were considered by the investigator to be minor. 2 (3.3%) patients each reported an oral 
bleeding (mouth hemorrhage and gingival bleeding) and a subcutaneous bleeding (contusion 
in one patient and ecchymosis and fall in a second patient). 1 (1.7%) patient reported a 
genito-urinary bleeding (haematuria). 1 (1.7%) patient who had experienced gingival 
bleeding (see above) also experienced other bleeding (haematoma and laceration).

patients from the general population (with potentially an increased risk) who were 
undergoing elective THR or TKR surgery in a routine clinical setting. This study was 
performed in accordance with the EMA recommendation to conduct a post approval study to 
evaluate the risk of bleeding in the more general population of patients with an increased risk 
of bleeding. 
The study provided safety and efficacy data in more than 5000 patients undergoing major 
orthopaedic surgery (2701 hip surgery patients and 2527 knee surgery patients). The 
demographic characteristics of patients in study 1160-0085 were generally comparable with 
patients in phase III knee or hip replacement studies. Approximately 40% of patients were in 
at least 1 sub-population of patients at an increased risk for bleeding or VTE (i.e. patients 
with co-morbidities of particular interest or taking concomitant medications of particular 
interest). The most common co-morbidities were chronic use of NSAIDs (15.9%), active 
smokers (13.3%), concomitant ASA use (6.9%), and CAD (6.0%). Other risk factors (history 
of CHF, history of VTE) were reported for fewer than 5% of patients. 
The incidence of the primary efficacy endpoint was 1.04% (95% CI: 0.78%, 1.35%). It was 
lower for patients undergoing hip surgery (0.55%, 95% CI: 0.31%, 0.90%) than for patients 
undergoing knee surgery (1.56%, 95% CI: 1.12%, 2.12%). With the exception of patients 
with a history of VTE (a known risk factor for recurrent VTE), the risk factors that were 
evaluated in the protocol-defined subgroups of special interest had little impact on the 
incidence of the primary endpoint. Patients with a history of VTE had a higher incidence of 
the primary endpoint (4.84%) than patients with no history of VTE (0.90%), OR for the 
composite endpoint for patients with vs. those without a history of VTE was 5.59 (95% CI: 
2.53, 11.08). Hence, a history of VTE was the only variable found to have a significant 
impact on the risk of an event (symptomatic VTE or all-cause death) in a univariate logistic 
regression analysis at a 5% level. 
In total, 38 patients had 40 MBEs during the treatment period. The incidence of MBEs for all 
patients in the study was 0.72% (95% CI: 0.51%, 0.98%) and was comparable for patients 
undergoing hip surgery (0.69%, 95% CI: 0.42%, 1.08%) and patients undergoing knee

surgery (0.74%, 95% CI: 0.45%, 1.16%). None of the protocol defined subgroup variables 
appeared to have a significant effect on occurrence of MBEs based on logistic regression 
analyses at a 5% level. 
The overall incidence of major extra-surgical bleeding events was 0.32% (95% CI: 0.19%, 
0.51%). Overall, only 17 major extra-surgical site bleedings were observed. The most 
common sites for extra-surgical bleeding events were gastrointestinal sites (n=13). A 
stratified analysis of incidences by protocol-defined subgroups showed there was a more than 
a 2-fold increase in the odds of major extra-surgical bleeding events for the subgroups of 
patients with CAD or CHF, for patients with concomitant use of ASA, and for patients within 
the combined subgroup of CAD, CHF, or history of VTE. The incidence of any bleeding 
event was 3.82% (95% CI: 3.32%, 4.37%). The most common sites for any bleeding event 
were the surgical site (n=144) and GI bleedings (n=43). None of the protocol-defined 
subgroup variables showed a marked effect on the occurrence of any bleeding event and the 
95% CIs overlapped across all subgroups.
In summary, dabigatran etexilate administered to patients undergoing hip or knee 
replacement surgery in accordance with the current European label, in a routine clinical 
setting, was safe and well tolerated. The pattern of AE reporting was similar to that observed 
in the corresponding phase III studies. However, the overall incidence of treatment-emergent 
AEs (which included bleeding events and efficacy outcome events), drug-related AEs, and 
SAEs was lower. The incidences of any bleeding events were also lower. None of the risk 
factors appeared to have a significant effect on occurrence of MBEs at a 5% level.
1160-0102 Cohort study in prevention of venous thromboembolic events after orthopaedic 
surgery in patients treated with Pradaxa: PETRO study [c05079154-04]
Study 1160-0102, a non-interventional PASS conducted to address the safety concern 
‘haemorrhage’ (important identified risk), was a cohort study in prevention of venous 
thromboembolic events after orthopaedic surgery in patients treated with dabigatran etexilate.  
This study was designed to respond to a request from the French Transparency Committee, 
dated 16 July 2008 [P10-03367], to follow-up a cohort of patients treated with dabigatran 
etexilate in France in order to ascertain the characteristics of treated patients, the actual 
conditions of use of dabigatran etexilate, the frequency of clinical (symptomatic) VTE events, 
the safety in terms of MBEs and the impact of dabigatran etexilate on the organisation of 
care. The primary endpoints were the occurrence of symptomatic clinical venous 
thromboembolic events (primary variable) and MBEs (primary covariate). 2 main subgroups 
were defined by the type of surgery: TKR or THR. A total of 1676 consecutive patients 
undergoing either THR (n=929) or TKR (n=747) were recruited.
The incidence of symptomatic VTEs was within the expected range for patients who 
underwent THR and was slightly higher than that expected in those that underwent TKR from 
the results from clinical trials but was similar to the range reported in the 2012 American 
College of Chest Physicians guidelines [P12-02756] and the FOTO study [R09-2242]. This 
may be due to differences in the percentage of patients who underwent TKR who had a 
history of VTE, which is a known to be a major risk factor for recurrent symptomatic VTE.

The patients who underwent THR in 1160-0102 had a higher rate of MBEs compared with 
that in the observational cohort study 1160-0085 (1.7% vs. 0.7%). Noteworthy is that patients 
aged >75 years were excluded from the 1160-0085 study. This is in contrast to the 1160-0102 
study where the observed incidence of MBEs was higher in patients aged ≥75 years than in 
younger patients (2.9% vs. 1.2%). The observed incidence of MBEs is compatible with the 
results from clinical trial 1160-0048 for patients who received 220 mg of Pradaxa. The 
incidences as well as the estimated upper limits of the 95% CI were lower than or equal to the 
estimated upper limit of the 95% CI in the 1160-0048 trial (220 mg/day). The analyses of the 
subgroups defined by type of anaesthesia, age, sex and centre activity did not show any 
differences in the observed incidences.
The observed incidence of MBEs for patients who underwent TKR, was higher in patients 
aged ≥75 years than in younger patients (1.3% vs. 1.0%). There was a slightly higher rate of 
MBEs in 1160-0102 compared to the 1160-0085 study (1.1% vs. 0.7%), but patients aged

The RE-COVERY DVT/PE was the first non-interventional, prospective study providing 
long-term safety and effectiveness outcome data comparing dabigatran with VKA treatment 
in a large cohort of consecutively enrolled patients with DVT, PE, or both. The incidence 
rates of major bleeding, CRNMBE, recurrent VTE, life-threatening bleeding, and all-cause 
mortality were low and consistent with results from pivotal trials. Compared with VKA, the 
risks of primary safety and effectiveness outcome events among patients receiving dabigatran 
were lower but not statistically significant based on the 95% CI of the HR. In summary, 
results from this study were consistent with those from controlled, pivotal trials supporting an 
effective and favourable safety profile of dabigatran for the treatment and secondary 
prevention of VTE in the routine clinical practice setting.

The following non-interventional studies conducted by BI are presented in ascending order of 
BI internal clinical study numbers: 1160-0129 (GLORIA-AF), 1160-0136 (GLORIA-AF -
Europe), 1160-0157, 1160-0162, 1160-0170, 1160-0183, 1160-0192, 1160-0207, 1160-0204 
(RE-CIRCUIT), and 1160-0248 (RESPECT CVT).
GLORIA-AF (1160-0129 and 1160-0136)
GLORIA-AF is a global, multicentre, prospective, non-interventional registry programme 
including patients newly diagnosed with NVAF and at risk for stroke. The main objectives of 
GLORIA-AF were to investigate patient characteristics influencing the choice of 
antithrombotic treatment for the prevention of stroke in patients with AF; and to collect real-
world data on important outcome events of antithrombotic treatments for the prevention of 
stroke.
GLORIA-AF phases II and III were conducted in global regions (study 1160-0129) and with 
focus on Europe (study 1160-0136). The main study design features within the respective 
protocols are identical.
GLORIA-AF was conducted in 3 phases:

0.48-0.87% PY (ischemic stroke: 0.43% PY, CI 0.29-0.61). The incidence rate was 
0.97% PY (0.76-1.23) for major bleeding, 0.46% PY (0.32-0.64) for life-threatening 
bleeding, 0.17% PY (0.09-0.29) for intracranial bleeding and 0.60% PY (0.43-0.80) for 
gastrointestinal bleeding. The incidence rate was 0.50% PY (0.35-0.69) for MI, 0.07% PY 
(95% CI 0.02–0.16) for pulmonary embolism, and 2.48% PY (2.13-2.87) for all-cause 
mortality.
Conclusions: The probability of remaining on dabigatran was high and the incidence rates of 
stroke and major bleeding were low, confirming the sustained safety and effectiveness of DE 
over 2 years of follow-up. Results from this study triggered the CCDS update to version 19 
(dated 19 Dec 2017) and are included in the CCDS section “Clinical trials“.
1160-0136 (Europe): Interim results GLORIA–AF: Global Registry on Long-Term Oral 
Antithrombotic Treatment in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation (Phase II/III – Europe); 
Baseline data for all Phase II patients following enrollment completion (GLORIA) 
[c03697437-01]
Interim data from GLORIA-AF from patients with NVAF at risk for stroke show that 
NOACs have been highly adopted into practice, becoming more frequently prescribed than 
VKAs in Europe and North America. In Europe, the majority of the assessed patient 
population received OACs. Overall, DE treatment and dosing in Europe were generally 
consistent with EU-SmPC recommendations. Some patients at moderate to high risk of stroke 
remain untreated or undertreated; e.g. receiving VKA, ASA, or no treatment when a NOAC 
may be optimal, or are receiving DE 110 when DE 150 could be considered based on the 
approved SmPC.
Based on the reported baseline data from phase II, there was no impact on the overall DE 
benefit-risk profile, and no amendment to the Product Information was required. CHMP 
endorsed the post-authorisation measure EMEA/H/C/000829/MEA/044 on 15 Sep 2016.
Phase III results
The main comparison of interest in phase III was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of 
DE vs. VKAs for a 3-year follow-up period. In the following sections, summaries of results 
from GLORIA-AF are provided separately for study 1160-0129 and 1160-0136. Complete 
information is provided in the CSRs for 1160-0129 (global results [c28497947-01]) and

Based on this primary analysis, patients on DE had a reduced risk of Composite Outcome, 
Vascular Composite Outcome, MBE, and all-cause death. Risks were similar between DE-
and VKA-treated patients, for stroke and MI, though point estimates were in favour of DE vs. 
VKA with 95% CIs including 1.

Common rate ratios, deemed as estimates of HRs, showed reduced risks of MBE and all-
cause death in DE-treated patients compared with VKA-treated patients. For other outcomes, 
similar risks between DE- and VKA-treated patients were generally observed, with point 
estimates in favour of DE and CIs including 1. With the exception of all-cause death, for 
which the 95% CI included 1 in the primary analysis, results for all selected outcomes based 
on these post-hoc analyses are consistent with those of the primary analysis.
For the composite outcomes, post-hoc analyses showed similar risks between DE-and 
VKA-treated patients, with point estimates in favour of DE and CIs sometimes including 1, 
as similarly observed in the primary and other sensitivity analyses.

of all-cause death and composite outcomes were reduced in the study 1160-0129, but not in 
study 1160-0136, as determined by the primary analysis, though point estimates were 
consistently in favour of DE vs VKA. It is noteworthy that post-hoc analyses for 1160-0136 
showed reduced risk of all-cause death.  The 1160-0136 study showed a similar risk of 
stroke, all-cause death, MI, Composite Outcome and Vascular Composite Outcome between 
DE- and VKA-treated patients; however point estimates were in favour of DE vs. VKA and 
95% CIs included 1.
Conclusion
The final analysis of GLORIA-AF phase III provides long-term prospective data of a large 
cohort of consecutive, newly diagnosed patients with AF who were at risk for stroke and 
were treated in routine clinical practice. The main comparison of interest in phase III of 
GLORIA-AF was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of DE vs. VKAs in patients with 
AF for a 3-year follow-up period. GLORIA-AF findings reinforce a favourable benefit-risk 
profile for DE compared with VKA in routine clinical practice among patients with newly 
diagnosed AF.
1160-0139: A regulatory requirement non-interventional study to monitor the safety and 
effectiveness of Pradaxa (Dabigatran etexilate mesilate, 110 mg or 150 mg b.i.d.) in Korean 
patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (SPARK: Safety study of Pradaxa in AF patients 
by Regulatory requirement of Korea) [c21807097-02]
The primary objective of this PASS was to monitor the safety profile of Pradaxa in Korean 
patients with non-valvular AF in a routine clinical setting. 3053 patients were included in the 
safety assessment and 2311 patients in the efficacy assessment. During the study period, 
126 SAEs were reported in 104 (3.41%) patients. Classifying the SAEs by SOC, the most 
common SAEs were from the SOC ‘Nervous system disorders’ in 1.08% of the subjects, 
followed by ‘Cardiac disorders’ in 0.59% and ‘Gastrointestinal disorders’ in 0.39% of the 
patients. By PT, the most common SAE was ‘Cerebral infarction’ in 0.36% of patients, 
followed by ‘Transient ischaemic attack’ in 0.23% and ‘Atrial fibrillation’ in 0.20% of 
patients. Of these, 32 events from 27 (0.88%) patients were serious AEs whose causality to 
the drug could not be ruled out.
648 unexpected AEs were reported from 508 (16.64%) patients. Classifying the unexpected 
AEs by SOC, the most common unexpected AEs were from the SOC ‘Gastrointestinal 
disorders’ in 5.73% of patients, followed by ‘Nervous system disorders’ in 2.85% and 
‘General disorders and administration site conditions’ in 2.00% of patients.
Of these, 240 events from 217 (7.11%) patients were unexpected ADRs whose causality to 
the drug could not be ruled out. Classifying the unexpected ADRs by SOC, the most common 
unexpected ADRs were from the SOC ‘Gastrointestinal disorders’ in 4.62% of patients, 
followed by ‘Nervous system disorders in’ 0.92% and ‘General disorders and administration 
site conditions’ in 0.79% of the patients. By PT, the most common unexpected ADR was 
‘Gastrointestinal disorder’ in 2.72% of patients, followed by ‘Abdominal pain upper in 0.82% 
of patients and ‘Abdominal discomfort’ in 0.46% of patients.

During this surveillance period, 82 unexpected SAEs were reported in 70 patients (2.29%). 
The most common unexpected SAEs were from the SOC ‘Cardiac disorders’ in 0.52% of 
patients, followed by ‘Infections and infestations’ in 0.36% and ‘Nervous system disorders’ 
in 0.29% of patients. By PT, the most common unexpected SAE was ‘Atrial fibrillation’ in 
0.20% of patients, followed by ‘Dyspnoea’ and ‘Cellulitis’ each occurring in 0.10% of 
patients and ‘Acute kidney injury’, ‘Back pain’, and ‘Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease’ 
each occurring in 0.07% of patients. 
Of these, 10 events from 8 (0.26%) patients were unexpected SAEs whose causality to the 
drug could not be ruled out (i.e. serious ADRs). By PT, the most common serious ADRs were 
‘Acute kidney injury’, ‘Bursitis’, and ‘Arterial rupture’ each occurring in 1 patient.
The efficacy assessment was conducted by calculating the frequency and percentage of 
patients experiencing stroke or systemic embolism among those on Pradaxa for 12 weeks or 
longer since the 1st visit. Of the patients on Pradaxa for 12 weeks or longer from the 1st visit 
(ordinary surveillance), stroke occurred in 0.30%, with no patient experiencing systemic 
embolism. Of the patients on Pradaxa for 24 weeks or longer from the 1st visit (long term 
administration), stroke occurred in 0.36%, with no patient experiencing systemic embolism.
The conclusion from this Pradaxa PMS study results showed no abnormal tendencies 
compared to previously reported AE incidences and no specific issues that could affect safety 
and efficacy. Therefore, it is considered that administration of Pradaxa to reduce the risk of 
stroke and systemic embolism in Korean patients with NVAF is safe and effective, and the 
use of the drug will continue to be monitored through spontaneous reports.
1160-0157: Comparative Effectiveness of Oral Anticoagulants: A Cohort Study
[c02409758-01]
This study, which was completed in 2014, was the first part of a long-term study programme 
with Brigham and Women’s Health to assess comparative safety and effectiveness of Pradaxa 
in the real world. This programme uses 2 large commercial US health insurance databases 
and propensity score matching to compare new users of dabigatran and warfarin with respect 
to ischaemic and bleeding events, with several planned interim analyses.
The first analysis included only 1 database (United Health Research Database). Following 
propensity score matching, new users of dabigatran and warfarin were compared to assess 
pre-specified stroke and bleeding events. 4158 patients were identified with NVAF and 
CHA2DS2-VASc scores ≥1 who initiated dabigatran, and 7724 patients who initiated 
warfarin from October 2010 – June 2012.
Propensity scores including known risk factors for the outcomes of interest produced matched 
groups with nearly identical characteristics: 2991 dabigatran initiators with 1237 PY follow-
up and 2991 warfarin initiators with 950 PY follow-up. Average age was 63 years and 9% 
had a recent stroke. Follow-up ended at anticoagulant discontinuation, study event, or 
insurance disenrolment. Warfarin initiators discontinued earlier and more frequently. There

were 36 strokes among dabigatran users vs. 30 among warfarin users (Cox HR=1.05, 95% 
CI: 0.64, 1.70), along with 74 major bleedings among dabigatran users vs. 63 in warfarin 
users (HR=0.97, 0.69, 1.36).
These first feasibility results are limited by the small sample size, short follow-up and few 
events resulting in wide 95% CIs. No comparative conclusions on the safety and 
effectiveness of Pradaxa in clinical practice can be drawn at this stage due to limited sample 
size and observation time. After this feasibility analysis future data in the context of the 
subsequent protocol (study 1160-0207) will increase the number of patients and potential 
follow-up and also expand to additional data sources (Marketscan). The study results have 
been submitted to the EMA (procedure number EMEA/H/C/000829/II/0092).
1160-0162: An observational study assessing the management of gastrointestinal and 
urogenital bleeding events in patients with atrial fibrillation treated with dabigatran etexilate 
[c14372587-01]
1160-0162 was an observational study with the main objective to assess the clinical 
characteristics of GI and GU bleeding events in patients with NVAF taking dabigatran 
etexilate who present to Eds/Ers for management of such events. This study additionally 
collected information to describe the diagnostic evaluations and treatments provided to 
resolve these events, and the clinical outcomes of these events. The study was initiated and 
conducted prior to registration of the specific reversal agent of dabigatran.
Patients who presented to the ED/ER (index visit) with an acute GI and/or GU bleeding event 
(index event) at one of the participating study sites between 28 Oct 2010 and 01 Aug 2013 
(eligibility period) were included in the chart review.
Site staff from 44 clinical sites collected data from the medical charts of 220 patients. The 
mean age (SD) of patients was 76.1 years (10.3) and 108 were female (49%). Of patients with 
known date of AF diagnosis (n=119), 99 (83.2%) were diagnosed with AF ≥6 months prior to 
ED/ER visits for the index bleeding events. 84 patients (38.3%) were taking one or more 
medications known to increase the risk of bleeding within 5 days prior to ED presentation.
Anatomic locations of the bleedings are described below by type of bleeding event; bleeding 
appearing in multiple locations was possible: n=4 patients (1.8%) had both GI and GU 
bleeding.

For most patients (n=170, 77.3%), at least one intervention was documented in the charts, 
while 50 patients (22.7%) received no intervention to treat their bleeding events. The most 
common intervention was discontinuation of dabigatran (n=157, 71.4%) followed by 
transfusion/infusion (n=81, 36.8%, predominantly packed red blood cell transfusions: 
n=60/81, 74.1%). 3030 (13.6%) patients had medications documented in their medical record 
considered to have been used to treat the bleeding event. Those medications included proton 
pump inhibitors (PPIs, 25 patients, all with GI bleed), vitamin K (n=7), H2 antagonists (n=1), 
and factor concentrate (n=1). Surgery was reported for 15 patients (6.8%) and therapeutic 
procedures (e.g. colonoscopy) for 21 patients (9.5%). The mean duration of index visit was 
7.6 hours (SD: 8.5). 148 (67.3%) patients were admitted to the hospital with a mean duration 
of stay of 5.7 days (SD: 6.6). 14 patients had a revisit beyond 7 days following the index 
discharge.
At the time of index discharge, 169 (76.8%) patients had their bleeding events resolved, 
42 patients still had some symptoms of bleeding and their bleeding was classified as ongoing 
(19.1%), 9 (4.1%) patients had died. Primary causes of death were index event (n=1), sepsis 
(n=2), congestive heart failure (n=2), cancer (n=1), cardiac arrest (n=2), and ischaemic bowel 
(n=1).
As specified in the protocol, all adverse events, including the index GI/GU bleeding event 
leading to the enrolment of the patient, were considered. Overall, 651 AEs were documented 
in the medical charts for the 220 patients. Of those, 395 were considered serious, occurring in 
184 patients (83.6%), while the remaining 256 were considered non-serious, occurring in 
136 patients (61.8%). 11 patients (5.0%) had 14 fatal adverse events; 9 died during the index 
hospitalisation and 2 died beyond the end of individual patient’s study period but before date 
of site close-out dates.
In these analyses based on 1034 patients (627 exposed to dabigatran), bleeding in patients 
receiving dabigatran was managed with comparable or superior effectiveness and lower 
30-day mortality rates, as compared to bleeding in patients receiving warfarin.
The sample size (220 patients) and availability of data in the patients’ ED/ER medical charts 
do not allow either for conclusions on the appropriateness of the measures taken to manage 
the bleeding events or for the assessment of their effectiveness. There is limited clinical 
knowledge to characterise the bleeding events and the rationale for treatment. However, it 
provides first insights into the characteristics of patients in the real-world setting in North 
America and on the treatment approaches prior to idarucizumab availability.
1160-0170: Use of Pradaxa (dabigatran etexilate) for stroke prevention in patients with 
NVAF and mild to moderate renal impairment [c02155743-03]
The aim of this cross-sectional, multicentre non-interventional study was to gain knowledge 
of the risk profile of patients in Germany with mild to moderate renal impairment who are 
intended to be treated with Pradaxa and to analyse the prescribing patterns of doctors in 
reference to this patient subpopulation. The primary endpoint was the CrCl at the prescription

time point according to the Cockcroft-Gault formula (re-calculated using age, gender, body 
weight, and serum creatinine as documented in the case report form). All analyses were 
descriptive. Overall, 4340 patients were observed at the point in time of Pradaxa prescription, 
i.e. before start of treatment.
More than half of the patients (N=2220; 51.2%) were excluded from the per protocol analysis 
since they did not meet the pre-defined inclusion criteria of documented NFAV 
(1042 patients [24.0%]) or mild or moderate renal impairment as assessed by the clinical 
judgment of the physician (1668 patients (38.4%)). 25 patients (0.6 %) were documented as 
suffering from severe renal impairment as assessed by the clinical judgment of the physician.
120 patients (2.8%) were documented as suffering from valvular AF. With regard to the 
primary endpoint of the NIS, the median CrCl of the patients was 55.2 (43.6; 68.3) mL/min. 
226 (10.7%) patients had no renal impairment, 1003 (47.3%) patients had a mild degree of 
renal impairment, in 653 patients (30.8%) the renal impairment was moderate, and in 
93 (4.4%) patients the renal impairment was documented as severe based on the re-calculated 
CrCl according to the Cockcroft-Gault formula. With regard to the primary endpoint, 
physicians predominantly prescribed Pradaxa to patients with mild renal impairment as 
assessed by re-calculated CrCl according to the Cockcroft-Gault formula. The study results 
have been disclosed on clinicaltrials.gov under the identifier NCT01721837.

treatment-naïve patients aged 18-89 years, with first prescription claim for dabigatran (either 
FDA-approved dose) or warfarin between 01 Oct 2010 and 31 Jul 2012 (index date) and a 
diagnosis of NVAF during the 12 months before index date. 12 793 patients per treatment 
group (dabigatran or warfarin) following PSM were analysed. The dabigatran group 
experienced fewer strokes (adjusted HR [95% CIs] of 0.73 [0.55, 0.97]); hemorrhagic strokes 
(0.32 [0.14, 0.73]); major intracranial bleeding (0.49 [0.30, 0.79]); major urogenital 
(0.36 [0.18, 0.74]) and other (0.38 [0.22, 0.66]) bleeding; Mis (0.65 [0.45, 0.95]); and deaths 
(0.64 [0.55, 0.74]) than the warfarin group. Major lower gastrointestinal bleeding events were 
more frequent (1.30 [1.04, 1.62]) in the dabigatran group. 
The overall results of this study comparing the effectiveness and safety of dabigatran and 
warfarin in a large population of patients in clinical practice are consistent with those of the 
RE-LY randomised clinical trial. Compared with warfarin, dabigatran treatment was 
associated with fewer events across most outcomes measured, including stroke, major 
bleeding, MI, and death, but more frequent GI bleeding. 
A supplemental analysis consisting of only patients taking dabigatran 150 mg at index date 
led to overall similar results, although with lowered statistical power. The fewer patients in 
this subset analysis were overall younger and healthier than the patients in the original 
analysis, and fewer outcome events were observed. The subset analysis also had slightly less 
follow-up time for the dabigatran patients due to ending follow-up if and when they started 
taking 75 mg dabigatran.
1160-0192: The Comparative Safety and Effectiveness of Warfarin and Dabigatran Utilized 
in the Humana Non-Valvular Atrial Fibrillation Patient Population – A Retrospective 
Database Analysis [c16197989-01]
1160-0192 is a non-interventional study based on existing data was conducted including 
OAC-naïve new dabigatran (75 mg or 150 mg capsules administered orally, b.i.d.) or 
warfarin (1 to 10 mg tablets administered orally) users. Propensity score matching was used 
to control for channelling bias. Patients were followed-up until treatment discontinuation, 
switch to another OAC, disenrollment, end of the observation period, or death. 
A total of 7245 dabigatran and 14 490 warfarin users remained after PSM 1:2. Post-PSM 
dabigatran and warfarin cohorts showed no significant differences in baseline demographic 
characteristics. After PSM, dabigatran and warfarin users had mean (SD) ages of 73.9 (8.0) 
years and 74.0 (8.1) years, respectively, the proportion of males in both cohorts was 55.6% 
and the proportion of females in both cohorts was 44.4%. Comorbidity risk scores, stroke 
risk, and bleeding risk scores were not significantly different. Mean durations of follow up 
for dabigatran and warfarin patients were 207 and 224 days, respectively.
In the primary analysis of the primary outcomes, rates per 1000 PY of stroke (21.9 vs. 29.3, 
p=0.0111) and major bleeding (61.7 vs. 76.7, p=0.0011) were significantly lower in the 
dabigatran cohort compared to the warfarin cohort (SVII.Table 28). Similarly, based on HRs 
adjusted for covariates, risks for stroke (0.74, p=0.0149) and major bleeding (0.80, p=0.0023) 
were lower in the dabigatran cohort.

In the primary analysis of secondary outcomes, rates per 1000 PY of hemorrhagic stroke 
(1.5 vs. 4.4, p=0.0068), major extracranial bleeding (54.4 vs. 66.1, p=0.0055), venous 
thromboembolism (12.2 vs. 23.0, p<0.0001), and all-cause death (36.6 vs. 49.8, p=0.0004) 
were significantly lower in the dabigatran cohort (SVII.Table 28). Rates per 1000 PY of 
ischaemic stroke (21.7 vs. 26.4, p=0.0808), major intracranial bleeding (8.0 vs. 11.3, 
p=0.0749), TIA (10.7 vs. 13.0, p=0.261) and MI (13.6 vs. 16.1, p=0.2665) were not 
significantly different between the dabigatran and warfarin cohorts (SVII.Table 28). Based on 
HRs adjusted for covariates, lower risks for haemorrhagic stroke (0.32, p=0.0097), major 
extracranial bleeding (0.82, p=0.0108), venous thromboembolism (0.52, p<0.0001), and all-
cause death (0.73, p=0.001) were observed in the dabigatran cohort. For ischaemic stroke, 
TIA and MI, the risk were lower though not statistically significant (p=0.081, 0.261, 0.267 
respectively). In a post-hoc analysis that measured outcomes using an algorithm to define the 
principal diagnosis (the primary analysis used diagnosis codes in all service lines of medical 
claims in a hospitalisation, which could result in identification of multiple outcomes within a 
single hospitalisation), rates of stroke per 1000 PY were not significantly different between 
dabigatran and warfarin cohorts (12.4 vs. 16.1, p=0.0861, (SVII.Table 29). However, rates of 
major bleeding per 1000 PY were significantly lower in the dabigatran cohort compared to 
the warfarin cohort (35.6 vs. 46.9, p=0.0019, SVII.Table 29). Based on HRs adjusted for 
covariates, lower risk for major bleeding (0.75, p=0.0028) was observed in the dabigatran 
cohort compared to the warfarin cohort. There was no statistically significant difference in 
the risk for stroke (0.76, p=0.0904) in the dabigatran cohort compared to the warfarin cohort.
In the post-hoc analysis of secondary outcomes, rates per 1000 PY of hemorrhagic stroke 
(1.2 vs. 3.3, p=0.0271), major intracranial bleeding (4.4 vs. 8.6, p=0.0072), major 
extracranial bleeding (31.2 vs. 38.3, p=0.0284), and death (36.6 vs. 49.8, 0.0004) were 
significantly lower in the dabigatran cohort compared to warfarin cohort (SVII.Table 29). 
Rates per 1000 PY of ischaemic stroke (11.2 vs. 12.9, p=0.3502), TIA (3.4 vs. 4.4, p=0.4407) 
and MI (8.0 vs. 7.5, p=0.8017) were not significantly different between the dabigatran and 
warfarin cohorts (SVII.Table 29). Based on HRs adjusted for covariates, lower risks for 
hemorrhagic stroke (0.36, p=0.0366), major intracranial bleeding (0.50, p=0.0082), major 
extracranial bleeding (0.81, p=0.0394), and death (0.73, p=0.0007) were observed in the 
dabigatran cohort.
Similarly, for ischaemic stroke and TIA, the risks were lower though not statistically 
significant (p=0.350, 0.441, respectively).

treatment and treatment convenience when treated with Pradaxa or vitamin K antagonist for 
stroke prophylaxis in atrial fibrillation [c20654895-01]
This was a multicentre, multinational, non-interventional study in NVAF patients in Asia 
who had been treated with a VKA and were then switched to Pradaxa (Cohort A) or patients 
who were newly diagnosed with NVAF and initiated on either Pradaxa or VKA (Cohort B).
This non-interventional study, which was conducted in 5 SEASK countries, aimed at 
collecting real world data on how Asian patients with NVAF perceive their anticoagulant 
treatment with Pradaxa in comparison to treatment with a VKA.
The safety data collected in this study did not give rise to any new safety concerns.

p=0.49). For major bleeding, event rates per 100 PY were 16.9 in dabigatran patients and 
12.4 in apixaban patients. The HR was 1.37 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.94, p=0.07).
Dabigatran users were observed to have a statistically significant lower risk of major bleeding 
compared to rivaroxaban users and no difference compared to apixaban users. Neither cohort 
was observed to have a significant difference in stroke risk. Results of this study may better 
inform clinical decisions in management of NOAC usage for NVAF patients within the 
United States.
1160-0202 Early dabigatran treatment after transient ischemic attack and minor ischemic 
stroke does not result in hemorrhagic transformation (Canadian Pradaxa Acute Stroke Safety 
Study [CPASS]).
This was a prospective, multi-centre registry designed to demonstrate the feasibility and 
safety of initiating dabigatran therapy within 14 days of TIA or minor stroke in AF patients.
Early dabigatran treatment did not precipitate symptomatic haemorrhagic transformation after 
minor stroke. Asymptomatic haemorrhagic transformation was associated with larger 
baseline infarct volumes. Early recurrent ischaemic events may be clinically more important. 
This observation does reassure current practice patterns are safe, but conclusive evidence will 
require a larger sample size.
Selected study results from non-interventional studies from independent sources
In the following sections, investigator initiated studies with high relevance in BI’s view are 
described in further detail.
Cardiovascular, bleeding, and mortality risks in elderly Medicare patients treated with 
dabigatran or warfarin for nonvalvular atrial fibrillation [P14-15648]
This is a retrospective, propensity score matched analysis of US Medicare claims database 
(October 2010 – December 2012). The study included new users of Pradaxa (n=67 207) or 
warfarin (n=67 2017), aged ≥65 years. The results show a non-significant lower major 
bleeding rate of 4.27/100 PY for Pradaxa compared to 4.39/100 PY for warfarin with an 
adjusted HR of 0.97 (P=0.50). The rate of ICH is significantly lower with 0.33/100PY for 
Pradaxa compared to 0.96 /100PY for warfarin with an adjusted HR of 0.34 (P<0.001). The 
rate of GI bleeding is however significantly increased with a rate of 3.42 / 100PY for Pradaxa 
and a rate of 2.65/100PY for warfarin. These results closely mirror the results generated for 
the dose of 150mg b.i.d. in the MAH clinical trial programme for SPAF patients. The 
differences between dabigatran and warfarin for other endpoints such as ischemic stroke (IS, 
aHR: 0.80, significant decrease), MI (aHR: 0.92, non-significant decrease, refer to section 
“Myocardial infarction”) and mortality (aHR: 0.86, significant decrease) are also comparable 
to the results seen in RE-LY for DE 150 mg b.i.d. Of note is that in the US only the 150 mg 
b.i.d. and the 75 mg b.i.d. dose for patients with severe renal impairment are approved
(SVII.Figure 1).

95% CI 0.53-0.94) and increased risk of major extracranial bleeding (HR=2.04; 95% CI 1.78-
2.32) compared with apixaban.
The authors conclude that among patients treated with standard dose NOAC for NVAF and 
warfarin users with similar baseline characteristics, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban 
were associated with a more favourable benefit-harm profile than warfarin. Among NOAC 
users, dabigatran and apixaban were associated with a more favourable benefit-harm profile 
than rivaroxaban.
In summary, this publication on real world evidence of antithrombotic treatment with 
Pradaxa did not change the favourable benefit-risk profile of Pradaxa, and in fact confirmed 
the favourable benefit-risk profile also in comparison to other NOACs.
Effectiveness and Safety of Dabigatran and Warfarin in Real-World US Patients with Non-
Valvular Atrial Fibrillation: a Restrospective Cohort Study [P15-03621]
This is a retrospective, propensity score weighted analysis of Truven Health Market Scan and 
Medicare databases (2009-2012). The study included new users of Pradaxa (n=21 070) and 
warfarin (n=43 865). The GI bleeding rate was with 3.21/100 PY higher for Pradaxa-treated 
patients compared to 2.18/100PY in warfarin treated patients. The HR was significantly 
higher for Pradaxa treated patients (adjusted HR: 1.11; 95% CI: 1.02 – 1.22). The 
hemorrhagic stroke rate was significantly reduced for Pradaxa treated patients (0.33/100PY) 
as compared to warfarin treated patients (0.8/100PY) with a adjusted HR of 0.51 (95%CI: 0.4 
– 0.65). Of note is that in the US, only the 150 mg BI and the 75mg b.i.d. dose for patients 
with severe renal impairment is approved (see figure below).
In this study the frequency of ICH is lower and the frequency for GI bleeding higher than for 
warfarin. The other endpoints show a similar picture as seen in clinical trials, namely a lower 
rate of ischaemic stroke (aHR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.81 – 1.02, non-significant decrease) and a 
composite of thromboembolic events (aHR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.79 – 0.93, significant decrease) 
in dabigatran vs. warfarin treated patients. The MI rate is in this trial also lower for Pradaxa 
as compared to warfarin (aHR: 0.88, 95% CI 0.77 – 0.99, see section “Myocardial 
infarction”), which is the opposite to what has been observed in the RE-LY clinical trial.

major bleeding events was significantly lower with dabigatran (1.4±0.8%, 95% CI 
0.4%-4.2%) vs. warfarin (5.0±1.5%, 95% CI 2.8%–8.8%) (p=.03). There were 0 and 1 (0.5%) 
thromboembolic events after ablation in the dabigatran and warfarin groups, respectively.
In patients undergoing ablation for NVAF, anticoagulation with minimally-interrupted 
dabigatran did not increase thromboembolic events and was associated with fewer bleeding 
complications than uninterrupted warfarin.
Characterising the risk of major bleeding in patients with Non-Valvular Atrial Fibrillation: 
noninterventional study of patients taking Direct Oral Anticoagulants in the EU
This was a pharmacoepidemiological study using longitudinal data collected in 8 electronic 
health care databases from 6 EU countries to characterise the use of DOACs (dabigatran, 
rivaroxaban, apixaban) as well as the risk of major bleeding in a real-world setting to help 
establish the effectiveness of existing and future risk minimisation measures.
The objectives and conclusions for each objective are summarised below:
Objective 1: assess the risk of major bleeding associated with use of DOACs when compared 
to other OACs in patients with NVAF overall and in relevant clinical and demographical 
subgroups in a real-life setting. Conclusion: Compared to other OACs, apixaban was not 
associated with an increased risk of GI bleeding in all data sources and seemed to be 
associated with the lowest risk of major bleeding events compared to dabigatran and 
rivaroxaban.
Objective 2: assess the utilisation of DOACs in the EU for treatment of NVAF, including the 
characterisation of new DOAC users in NVAF patients. Conclusion: The overall incidence of 
new DOAC users increased during the study period, with the highest increase for apixaban. 
Cross national drug utilisation studies with a standard protocol may help to compare drug use 
and identify sources of variation enabling health care decisions.
Objective 3: assess prescribers’ compliance with SmPC recommendations for each DOAC. 
Conclusion: Contraindications, Special Warnings and Precautions, and potential DDIs were 
present in a substantial number of new DOAC users. Differences found between the 
databases might be related to ‘true’ differences in prescription behaviour but could partially 
relate to discrepancies in database characteristics.
The availability of results from this study triggered an EMA Article 5(3) procedure for 
DOACs including Pradaxa.  
PFP Australia
The dabigatran etexilate PFP in Australia was completed in 2013. The results are summarised 
below. In Australia, the dabigatran etexilate PFP was initiated to allow Australian physicians 
a controlled, structured, early experience with dabigatran etexilate in the newly approved 
indication “Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with NVAF and at least

one additional risk factor for stroke”. The PFP commenced on 31 May 2011 and patient 
enrolment in the programme was closed on 14 Oct 2011.
A total of 28 057 patients were enrolled in the Australian PFP. As of 31 Aug 2013 the 
cumulative patient exposure to dabigatran etexilate in the PFP was 48 809 PY. By 
30 Nov 2013, 3418 enrolled patients reported at least 1 adverse reaction to BI. The data from 
these 3418 patients were compared to those from 52 423 case reports received from ROW, 
and also with data from the RE-LY clinical trial.
Reporting rates per 10 000 PY for serious/fatal bleeding, serious/fatal MI and serious/fatal 
stroke showed higher rates for the PFP than for ROW. This likely reflects the stimulated 
reporting situation of the PFP, as opposed to the spontaneous reporting from ROW. Another 
factor may be found in the differences in the patient populations, which showed the PFP 
population to be on average older and (according to reported concomitant medication) 
possibly at a higher CV risk than the ROW population. A comparison with data from the 
RELY clinical trial showed reporting rates to be lower for the PFP for most events. The 
reporting rate for fatal MI was similar to that seen in RE-LY; the reporting rate was slightly 
higher for fatal stroke. The advanced age of the PFP population may have played a role in 
both. For fatal stroke the small absolute number of reports from the PFP must also be taken 
into consideration.
In summary, observations suggest that differences in patient population and the specific 
stimulated reporting conditions of the PFP explain the differences seen in various reporting 
rates when Australian data are compared to ROW. The benefit-risk ratio for Pradaxa is 
unchanged and favourable.
Post-marketing data
The SMQ Haemorrhage terms (excl laboratory terms) was used to retrieve cumulative post-
marketing cases (including non-interventional studies) reporting bleeding events up to 
28 Feb 2022. A characterisation of the risk based on post-marketing data is presented below 
(data source: Pradaxa PBRER with DLP 18 Mar 2022 [s00104884-01], section 16.4.1.4).
At DLP, there were 57 807 post-marketing case reports for Pradaxa in the BI GSP which 
included at least 1 haemorrhagic ADR from the SMQ. This represents 42.4% of the total 
post-marketing cases for Pradaxa (n=136 320). Included in these cases were 
70 974 individual haemorrhagic events (serious and non-serious), distributed among 
330 different PTs.
Of these 57 807 cases, 51 072 (88.4%) were spontaneous reports, 6735 (11.6%) were 
solicited.
A total of 42 153 serious AEs were reported from the SMQ ‘Haemorrhage’, representing 
59.4% of all 70 974 events from the SMQ. This includes 5877 AEs associated with a fatal 
outcome from the SMQ, representing 8.3% of all events from the SMQ. Another 
28 821 events were non-serious events, representing 40.6% of all events from the SMQ.

bleeding event. These 1715 cases are the basis for further evaluation presented below; the 
well-known limitations of spontaneous reporting need to be considered though.
Of the 1715 cases, 224 patients had documented RF values below 30 mL/min, 573 patients 
between 30 and 50 mL/min, 681 patients between 50 and 80 mL/min, and 237 patients above 
80 mL/min at any time prior to the onset of bleeding event. In cases with more than 1 data set 
available, only the minimal (worst) reported renal function value per patient was taken for the 
classification (following a conservative approach).
Restricting the time gap between determination of RF and the onset of the bleeding event to a 
medically more sensible time frame (i.e. 7 days) led to a set of 466 cases. The distribution of 
these cases according to renal function revealed 88 patients with RF values <30 mL/min, 
143 patients with 30 – 50 mL/min, 168 patients with >50 – 80 mL/min, and 67 patients with 
RF values >80 mL/min.
The RF test dates any time before bleeding (n=1715) were then translated into reporting rates 
in order to put the received number of cases with information on RF value per category over 
time into perspective with the growing post-marketing exposure. The figure below shows the 
reporting rates for Pradaxa cases with RF measured prior to bleeding event based on overall 
cumulative Pradaxa exposure.

(categories A and D in the figure above), the cumulative reporting rate is stable at a very low 
level of approximately 0.2 ICSRs / 10 000 PY).
Based on the post-marketing data presented, the risk minimisation activities initiated by BI 
are considered to be effective. While potential underreporting is a limitation of post-
marketing data analysis, the overall reporting rate for patients with severe renal impairment 
experiencing a bleeding event has been approximately halved since the initiation of the risk 
minimisation activities.
Post-marketing cases of bleeding due to potential interactions with concomitant drugs
Interaction with anticoagulants or P-gp inhibitors
The table below shows the effect of concomitant medications which may pose an increased 
risk of haemorrhage due to PK or PD interaction when taken simultaneously with Pradaxa on 
the percentage of case reports involving any bleeding event (cumulative; DLP 28 Feb 2022). 
The case selection includes all post-marketing events, including events considered to be 
causally unrelated.

events, or unplanned revascularisation, of borderline statistical significance, than patients 
receiving clopidogrel in this study.
Despite the higher bleeding risk observed in patients treated with ticagrelor, the benefits of 
both dabigatran 110 mg and 150 mg dual therapy compared with warfarin triple therapy were 
consistent across the ticagrelor and clopidogrel subgroups.
Post-marketing data on interactions (cumulative, health authority and spontaneous cases 
only)
Until the DLP of this reference period, BI received cumulatively 83 ICSRs with concomitant 
use of ticagrelor in the GSP; 53 of the 83 cases report overt haemorrhagic events. In 43 of 
these cases, ASA was also reported as co-medication and in 2 cases enoxaparin was reported 
as co-medication. The data did not show any deviating safety.

Study design: 
This is a European non-interventional multi-centre cohort study based on new data collection. 
The study aims to enrol 50 paediatric patients under 2 years of age treated with dabigatran at 
approximately 30 study centres over a 2-year period. The time to evaluate the safety profile 
of dabigatran will be 3 months. Patients will be enrolled at paediatric hospitals/hospital 
departments and clinics. Safety outcomes will be estimated during the on-treatment period 
starting the day of cohort entry and ending at the time of disenrollment, death, 
discontinuation of the dabigatran treatment or switch to different anticoagulant, end of 
observation period (3 months), whichever comes first.
Study populations: 
Patients under 2 years of age treated with dabigatran etexilate for VTE and for the prevention 
of recurrent VTE.
Milestones:

SUMMARY OF RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR PRADAXA (dabigatran etexilate)
This is a summary of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for Pradaxa. The RMP details 
important risks of Pradaxa, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will 
be obtained about Pradaxa’s risks and uncertainties (missing information).
Pradaxa’s Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Pradaxa should be used.
This summary of the RMP for Pradaxa should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which 
is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Pradaxa’s RMP.
I.
THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Pradaxa contains the active substance dabigatran and belongs to a group of medicines called 
anticoagulants. It works by blocking the activity of a substance in the body which is involved 
in blood clot formation.
Pradaxa is used in adults to (see SmPC for the full indications):

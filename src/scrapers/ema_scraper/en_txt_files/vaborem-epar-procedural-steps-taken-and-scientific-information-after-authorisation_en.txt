SmPC, Annex 
Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
II, Labelling 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
and PL 
Vaborem in the approved indication remains favourable and 
therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation with unlimited validity. 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

A grouped application including 8 type II variations 
(C.I.4) and 1 type II variation (C.I.13):  
Update of sections 4.5 and 5.2 of the SmPC based on 
the results of a series of non-clinical drug-drug 
interaction studies undertaken with vaborbactam or 
meropenem. The Package Leaflet has been updated 
accordingly.  In addition, the MAH has submitted 
non-clinical data on the phototoxicity potential of 
meropenem from a 3T3 neutral red uptake 
phototoxicity test.

C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to

data 
meropenem CYP450 enzyme and transporter-mediated 
interaction potential indicated low potential for PK 
interactions between vaborbactam and meropenem and 
other drugs with regards to CYP inhibition and transporters 
but not for CYP induction. Relevant drug-drug interactions 
due to CYP3A4 induction by vaborbactam and meropenem 
cannot be excluded.  
Vaborbactam and meropenem were identified as OAT3 
substrates in the in vitro assay, but no clinically relevant 
inhibition of OAT3 by vaborbactam and meropenem is 
expected. 
Vaborem may decrease the efficacy of hormonal 
contraceptive drugs containing oestrogen and/or 
progesterone. Women of childbearing potential should be 
advised to use alternative effective contraceptive methods 
during treatment with Vaborem and for a period of 28 days 
after discontinuation of treatment.

Regarding the potential phototoxicity of meropenem, the in 
vitro phototoxicity study is indicative of lack of 
phototoxicity for this active substance.

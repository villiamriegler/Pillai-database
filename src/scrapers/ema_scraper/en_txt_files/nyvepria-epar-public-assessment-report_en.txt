2.  Scientific discussion 
About the product 
PF-06881894 (Nyvepria) has been developed as a similar biological medicinal product to Neulasta (INN: 
pegfilgrastim) (6 mg solution, prefilled syringe ready to use, for manual subcutaneous injection) which 
was approved in the European Union (EU) in August 2002 (EMEA/H/C/000420, Amgen Europe B.V., the 
Netherlands). The proposed indication for PF-06881894 is the same as that for Neulasta. 
The indication proposed for PF-06881894 in the EU is:  
Reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in adult patients treated 
with  cytotoxic  chemotherapy  for  malignancy  (with  the  exception  of  chronic  myeloid  leukemia  and 
myelodysplastic syndromes). 
Neulasta is a pegylated G-CSF (ATC Code: L03AA13, immunostimulants, colony stimulating factor). G-
CSF produced in Escherichia coli (E. coli) by recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) technology, is not 
glycosylated  and  contains  an  N-terminal  methionine.  Pegylation  of  recombinant  filgrastim  does  not 
appear to affect its binding capacity to the G-CSF receptor and functionality on granulopoiesis.  
Endogenous G-CSF is the primary regulating factor for neutrophils. The G-CSF acts by binding to G-CSF 
receptors,  resulting  in  stimulated  proliferation,  differentiation,  commitment,  and  target  cell  functional 
activation.  Endogenous  G-CSF  is  known  to  stimulate  proliferation  of  the  mitotic  cells  to  reduce  the 
maturation time of the non-mitotic cells in the bone marrow and to prolong the life span and enhance 
the  function  of  mature  neutrophils.  Endogenous  G-CSF  is  produced  by  different  cell  types  including 
macrophages, monocytes, fibroblasts, stromal cells in bone marrow and endothelial cells. Endogenous 
G-CSF is triggered by inflammatory signals as well as by lipopolysaccharide released from bacteria.  
Pegfilgrastim has the same mechanism of action (MoA) as endogenous G-CSF and filgrastim, i.e. it acts 
on haematopoietic cells by binding to the specific cell surface receptors, thereby stimulating proliferation, 
differentiation, commitment, and end cell functional activation.  
Pegylation (i.e. addition of the 20 kDa polyethylene glycol [PEG] molecule) increases both the molecular 
weight  and  the  size  of  filgrastim.  The  molecular  weight  increases  from  19  kDa  (filgrastim)  to  39  kDa 
(pegfilgrastim). This is still below the 60-70 kDa molecular weight that is considered to be required to 
avoid  glomerular  filtration  and  subsequent  renal  elimination.  The  hydrodynamic  radius,  however, 
increases approximately 2.5- to 3-fold (calculated using equations in Fee and Van Alstine). This increases 
the size of filgrastim from ~4 nm to ~6 nm in diameter. In general, proteins ≥6 nm in diameter (e.g. 
haemoglobin 6.4 nm and albumin 7 nm) avoid glomerular filtration. With the reduction in renal clearance, 
the primary means of pegfilgrastim removal from the circulation is by neutrophil-mediated clearance. 
Both neutrophils and neutrophil precursors express G-CSF receptor, which binds pegfilgrastim and the 
drug-receptor complex is internalised and degraded inside the cell. 
Pegylation serves to prolong the circulating half-life of biologic agents. Because of the prolonged half-
life of pegfilgrastim, pegfilgrastim does not require daily injection as with filgrastim and can be given 
once per chemotherapy cycle.

The  development  programme  for  PF-06881894  was  designed  to  demonstrate  biosimilarity  to  the 
pegfilgrastim products marketed globally as Neulasta, using the licensed products sourced from both the 
US and EU as representative of global supply.  
In  general,  PF-06881894  development  followed  a  stepwise  approach  to  demonstrate  similarity  across 
Chemistry, Manufacturing and Control (CMC), quality, and nonclinical and clinical (pharmacokinetics PK, 
pharmacodynamics PD, safety and immunogenicity) data consistent with feedback received from health 
authorities  during  the  biosimilar  product  development  meetings,  and  health  authority  guideline 
documents.

For  the  quality  biosimilarity  analysis,  the  applicant  performed  an  extensive  comparability  exercise 
including  side-by-side  testing  by  a  combination  of  orthogonal  analytical  methods,  which  are  properly 
qualified, and by using up to 17 batches of pegfilgrastim-EU and pegfilgrastim-US and up to 10 batches 
of Nyvepria DP. The quality biosimilarity testing programme included a combination of physicochemical, 
biochemical and biological activity tests, which covered all important quality attributes of pegfilgrastim. 
Also, comparative degradation studies were performed to study the degradation profile of Nyvepria and 
EU- and US-sourced Neulasta. Taken together, the quality biosimilarity analysis was in compliance with 
the applicable EMA guidance (CHMP/437/04 Rev 1 and EMA/CHMP/BWP/247713/201). 
The goal of the clinical program was to demonstrate that there are no clinically meaningful differences 
between PF-06881894 and Neulasta.  
Based on feedback received from the US FDA and EMA regulatory interactions, the clinical development 
program  for  the  proposed  biosimilar  PF-06881894,  the  following  2  comparative  clinical  studies  were 
conducted: 
• Study ZIN-130-1505: An open-label, randomized, single-dose, comparator-controlled crossover 
PD/PK equivalence study in healthy volunteers to compare PF-06881894 to pegfilgrastim-US and 
pegfilgrastim-EU.  
•  Study  C1221005:  A  randomized,  open-label,  multiple-dose,  non-inferiority,  parallel-group 
immunogenicity  study  in  healthy  volunteers  to  demonstrate  the  non-inferiority  of  PF-06881894 
versus pegfilgrastim-US with respect to immunogenicity. It should be noted that the comparative 
immunogenicity  study  (C1221005)  had  already  started  at  the  time  of  the  EU  scientific  advice 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/720012/2017).  Its  study  design  was  selected  based  on  FDA  Guidance  for 
Industry. Therefore, CHMP remarks on this study were rather for the sake of scientific discussion 
rather than reflecting a formal request of the CHMP. In particular, a blinded design would have 
been preferred, and the proposed non-inferiority design is not requested for safety data. 
The  CHMP  has  agreed  that  the  clinical  dossier  for  a  biosimilar  application  for  a  PEG-filgrastim  may 
comprise  of  healthy  volunteer  trials  only,  provided  that  biosimilarity  can  be  sufficiently  demonstrated 
based  on  a  strong  and  convincing  physicochemical  and  functional  data  package  and  comparable 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles. 
The ZIN-130-1505 study established the PD and PK equivalence of: PF-06881894 to pegfilgrastim-US; 
PF-06881894 to pegfilgrastim-EU; and pegfilgrastim-US to pegfilgrastim-EU.  
In  the  comparative  immunogenicity  study  C1221005,  Pfizer  proposed  to  compare  the  biosimilar  and 
pegfilgrastim-US. According to the “Guideline on Similar Biological Medicinal Products” (CHMP/437/04 
Rev 1), the reference medicinal product should be a medicinal product authorised in EEA. However, it 
may be possible in some cases for an applicant to compare the biosimilar in clinical studies with a non-
EEA authorised comparator. In this case, the applicant needs to provide adequate data or information to 
scientifically justify the relevance of these comparative data and establish an acceptable bridge to the 
EEA-authorised  reference  product.  The  type  of  bridging  data  needed  will  always  include  data  from 
analytical studies that compare all three products (the proposed biosimilar, the EEA-authorised reference 
product and the non EEA-authorised comparator), and may also include data from clinical PK and/or PD 
bridging studies for all three products. Given that biosimilarity has been demonstrated between EU- and 
US-sourced Neulasta, the quality bridge is considered adequately established and the use of US-sourced 
Neulasta  lots  in  clinical  studies  is  therefore  considered  acceptable.  Since  immunogenicity  of  PF-
06881894, pegfilgrastim-US, and pegfilgrastim-EU was previously assessed in a 3 arm crossover PD/PK 
equivalence  study  in  healthy  volunteers  (ZIN-130-1505)  demonstration  of  equivalence  between  PF-
06881894  against  a  single  reference  product  (e.g.  pegfilgrastim-US)  in  the  proposed  comparative 
immunogenicity study is acceptable.

Overall,  the  comparative  PD,  PK,  and  safety  findings  from  Study  ZIN-130-1505  and  the  comparative 
immunogenicity and safety data from Study C1221005 contributed to the totality of evidence supporting 
a demonstration of biosimilarity of PF-06881894 to Neulasta. 
Study ZIN-130-1504, which was a non-comparative, parallel-group study characterising the PD, PK, and 
safety  (including  immunogenicity)  of  PF-06881894  in  patients  with  non-distantly  metastatic  breast 
cancer, is not considered to be integral to the biosimilar program and hence will not be discussed in the 
overview of clinical pharmacology, efficacy, or safety. An overview of biopharmaceutics and associated 
analytical methods, however, includes bioanalytical methods used in the 3 studies.

2.1.  Quality aspects 
2.1.1.  Introduction 
Nyvepria, referred to as PF-06881894 FP, is a proposed biosimilar to the Neulasta reference licensed 
product.  
The finished product is presented as a solution for subcutaneous (SC) injection containing 6 mg/0.6 ml 
of pegfilgrastim as active substance. Other ingredients are sorbitol, sodium acetate trihydrate, glacial 
acetic acid, polysorbate 20 and water for injection.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/603684/2020

Nyvepria is supplied in a single-dose prefilled syringe (Type I glass), with a plunger stopper and 
plunger rod, stainless steel needle and needle cover with an automatic needle guard. Each pre-filled 
syringe contains 0.6 ml of solution for injection. 
2.1.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
PF-06881894  (pegfilgrastim)  is  a  covalent  conjugate  of  recombinant  methionyl  human  granulocyte-
colony  stimulating  factor  (G-CSF)  (referred  to  as filgrastim)  and  a  20 kDa  monomethoxypolyethylene 
glycol propionaldehyde (mPEG-p). 
Filgrastim is expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli) as a 175 amino acid protein with a theoretical average 
mass of 18,799 Da. Filgrastim contains 5 cysteines, 4 of which oxidise to form disulfide bonds Cys37-
Cys43  and  Cys65-Cys75.  One  cysteine  remains  reduced  (free  thiol,  Cys18).  Filgrastim  expressed  in 
bacterial cells has no post-translational modifications. 
PF-06881894 is synthesised by Schiff-base reduction of a 20 kDa mPEG-p with the N-terminal amine of 
filgrastim at Met1. The mPEG-p used for pegylation is a heterogeneous mixture with varying numbers 
(approximately 412 to 536) of ethylene oxide units. As a result, PF-06881894 exhibits molecular 
weight dispersity with an observed distribution of approximately 37.0 to 42.5 kDa. The described 
general properties include the physical form, colour, clarity, pH, osmolality, isoelectric point, extinction 
coefficient and biological activity of the PF-06881894. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Manufacture of AS and filgrastim intermediate is performed at Hospira Zagreb d.o.o., Prudnička cesta 
60,  10291  Prigorje  Brdovečko,  Croatia  and  Hospira  Adelaide  Pty  Lts,  6  Dalgliesh  St,  Adelaide  5031, 
Australia. A third party manufactures the critical intermediate, mPEG-p. During the procedure, a MO was 
raised to request an updated QP declaration from the manufacturer Hospira Zagreb d.o.o., Brdovečko, 
Croatia to include dates and confirmation of the audits for the respective manufacturing sites. This was 
provided therefore appropriate GMP authorisations are now available for all sites. 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The manufacturing process for PF-06881894 active substance (AS) is a three-stage process. 
• 
• 
• 
Stage 1: upstream process, manufacture of PF-06881894 Inclusion Bodies (IB) 
Stage 2: downstream process, PF-06881894 Filgrastim Intermediate (FI) purification process 
Stage 3: pegylation, purification and formulation process, resulting in PF-06881894 AS 
The  IB  process  uses  a  recombinant  Escherichia  coli  (E.  coli)  cell  line  that  contains  the  plasmid  DNA 
encoding the sequence for filgrastim protein and is grown in suspension culture using animal component-
free (ACF) media. Cells from the working cell bank (WCB) are thawed and expanded to produce a seed 
culture. The seed culture is used to inoculate a production fermenter. Production fermentate is harvested, 
homogenised and centrifuged to produce PF-06881894 IB containing filgrastim protein. The recovered 
IBs are dispensed and frozen at the proposed condition in HDPE bottles.  
The IBs are thawed and undergo dissolution and refolding to produce the active filgrastim molecule. The 
product is then captured by a cation exchange chromatography (CEX) step and further processed by a 
flow through cation exchange chromatography (CEX) mixed mode chromatography step, a hydrophobic

interaction chromatography (HIC) step and an additional CEX chromatography step. Concentration and 
buffer exchange in an ultrafiltration/diafiltration (UF/DF) step is followed by formulation and filtration. 
The filtered PF-06881894 FI is filled into polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG) bottles, the closures 
sealed, labelled and frozen at the proposed storage condition. The PF-06881894 FI is tested and released 
according  to  the  specifications.  It  is  shipped  frozen  for  further  processing  to  Hospira  Zagreb,  under 
conditions validated for frozen shipment. 
The FI  is  thawed  and  pegylated,  where  20  kDa  mPEG-p  is  covalently  bound  to  FI.  Powdered  mPEG-p 
critical intermediate is used to prepare mPEG-p solution which is used on the same day the pegylation 
reaction is performed. The pegylated FI is further purified by CEX chromatography prior to concentration 
and  buffer  exchange  by  UF/DF.  The  protein  concentration  is  adjusted  to  a  target  concentration. 
Polysorbate 20 is then added and the formulated bulk solution is processed by a final (0.2 µm) filtration 
to produce the AS which is stored in PETG bottles at the proposed storage condition until finished product 
(FP) manufacture. Reprocessing conditions for specific steps have been defined. The process has been 
sufficiently described and in-process controls are adequately set to control the process. 
Control of materials 
All raw materials used in the AS manufacturing process are described and are either compendial grade 
or are tested according to in-house standards. Composition of the different media and buffers is detailed. 
In house specifications for non-compendial materials are provided. Activated mPEG-p is considered as 
an intermediate; PEG is considered as a starting material. No human or animal-derived raw materials or 
excipients were used in the development of the recombinant cell line or establishment of the master cell 
bank (MCB) and working cell bank (WCB). No human or animal-derived raw materials or excipients are 
used in the manufacture of PF-06881894 IB, FI and active substance. 
The information on the origin, production and composition including certificates of analysis was provided 
for the following raw materials: glycerol, bacto agar, yeast extract and vegetable peptone. No human or 
animal-derived compounds were used during production of these materials. 
The construction of the expression plasmid and the transformation of the E. coli strain to generate the 
research cell bank (RCB) was described in detail. The RCB was characterised and then used to derive a 
master cell bank (MCB) and WCB. Demonstration of cell substrate stability was performed according to 
the  ICH  guidelines  (ICH  Q5B  and  ICH  Q5D).  Testing  of  genetic  stability,  identity,  purity  and 
contamination by adventitious agents was performed on end of production cells (EPC). The cell banking 
system  is  adequately  described,  and  the  cell  banks  have  been  tested  and  characterised  (including 
demonstration  of  genetic  stability)  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  ICH  Q5D.  Stability  of  MCB 
and WCB is verified annually. Furthermore, the protocol for preparation and qualification of future WCBs 
was provided. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
The  control  of  the  critical  steps  and  intermediates  is  sufficiently  described.  Detailed  information  was 
provided on the control of the filgrastim intermediate. The proposed specifications (including tests for 
appearance,  pH,  identity,  protein  concentration,  potency,  purity,  impurities,  bioburden,  bacterial 
endotoxins, host cell proteins, host cell DNA) and acceptance criteria are deemed acceptable. Analytical 
methods were described, and method validation reports provided. More details on the control strategy 
is provided in the AS process validation section of this report. Batch data were provided confirming that 
all lots complied with the specifications. Regarding the host cell protein assay, which is a release test for 
FI,  the  applicant  demonstrated  that  the  anti-HCP  polyclonal  antibody  has  a  sufficiently  high  coverage 
with regard to the HCPs and is thus deemed suitable for the intended use.

The PF-06881894 filgrastim intermediate is filled into sterile polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG) 
bottles.  The  stability  data  support  the  proposed  shelf  life  and  storage  conditions  for  filgrastim 
intermediate.    
Methoxypolyethylene  glycol  propionaldehyde  (mPEG-p)  is  a  protein  pegylation  agent  used  in  the 
manufacture of PF-06881894 AS.  
A separate section is provided (according to the CTD structure of the AS section) for the mPEG-p critical 
intermediate  including  information  on  the  manufacturer,  process  and  controls,  control  of  materials, 
control of intermediates and critical steps, process validation, characterisation, impurities, specifications 
(including justifications), analytical methods (including their validation), batch data, reference standard, 
container closure and stability. The starting materials and intermediates involved in the manufacture of 
mPEG-p are controlled by the supplier according to their respective specifications. There are no materials 
of animal origin used in the manufacture of mPEG-p. 
Acceptance criteria for the proposed mPEG-p commercial release specifications (performed in-house on 
each  lot  of  mPEG-p  received  by  Pfizer)  are  provided  and  include  colour,  clarity,  pH,  water  content, 
identity,  average  MW,  polydispersity,  purity,  assay,  impurities,  bacteria;  endotoxins,  bioburden.  The 
proposed retest period is supported by stability data.    
Process validation 
Two  separate  manufacturing  facilities  (Hospira  Adelaide,  Australia  and  Hospira  Zagreb,  Croatia)  are 
involved in the manufacturing process. A sequential approach to validation was taken in which the AS 
processes were validated  separately to accurately model the way batches of AS will be manufactured 
during commercial operations. Reproducibility of each of the manufacturing stages (IB, FI and AS) was 
demonstrated in three, sequential manufacturing batches at the commercial scale and these are referred 
to as process performance qualification (PPQ) batches. Process validation (PV) studies were performed 
to validate other aspects of the manufacturing process such as resin lifetime, dispensing uniformity and 
shipping. 
Three  PF-06881894  IB  were  produced  and  three  FI  batches  from  these  lots.  These  PF-06881894  FI 
batches were then used to produce three independent AS batches. All release results met the proposed 
commercial specifications. Process parameter and in-process test data from the PPQ campaigns (IB, FI 
and AS) were within pre-defined control limits for the commercial process. The monitored parameters 
are in agreement with routine process controls and the process is considered to be adequately validated. 
The  strategy  for  the  setting  of  individual  process  parameters  was  justified.  The  proposed  shelf  life  is 
deemed acceptable based on the supportive data.  
The  applicant  has  provided  more  detailed  information  on  how  criticality  of  process  parameters  was 
assessed.  It  is  indicated  that  regardless  of  their  classification,  all  process  parameters  are  adequately 
controlled. Any deviations from normal operating ranges are investigated. The effective and consistent 
removal of a wide range of potential fermentation media-derived impurities, host cell-derived impurities 
and  purification  process-derived  impurities  was  demonstrated  for  the  AS  manufacturing  process.  All 
impurities (host cell DNA and HCP, IPTG, antifoam, EDTA and elemental impurities) are reduced to very 
low  levels  which  do  not  pose  safety  concerns.  Additional  PV  studies  were  performed  for  the  reuse, 
sanitisation and storage of chromatography resins and manufacturing scale resin lifetime studies. 
In-process hold times were validated at small scale or at manufacturing scale to demonstrate biochemical 
stability of in-process eluates and pools under controlled conditions. Shipment conditions for frozen PF-
06881894 FI in PETG bottles at the proposed temperature of storage are qualified for shipment from the 
site of manufacture of PF-06881894 FI to the site of AS manufacture.

Manufacturing process development 
The  applicant  has  described  the  development  of  the  manufacturing  process.  From  the  beginning  the 
commercial scale process was used for all batches produced thus far (engineering lots, non-clinical lots, 
clinical lots and PPQ lots). Only minor changes (mainly optimisations of process parameters ranges) were 
introduced in the process variants used for non-clinical, clinical and PPQ lots. 
Studies were performed to define the criticality of quality attributes and process parameters. Depending 
on the outcome of these studies and a risk assessment, a control strategy for the process was proposed. 
Bridging studies have been conducted for analytical methods with significant technical changes during 
the development; this included the reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), 
size exclusion chromatography (SEC), and ion exchange high performance liquid chromatography (IC-
HPLC) methods. The method bridging data demonstrated that the proposed commercial methods showed 
improved robustness or capability. 
Characterisation 
The  characterisation  program  adequately  demonstrates  that  the  primary  structure,  higher  order 
structure,  and  functional  characteristics  of  PF-06881894  AS/FP  are  consistent  with  the  expected 
structure and function of the pegfilgrastim molecule. 
The  structural  and  functional  characteristics  of  PF-06881894  have  been  examined  for  the  following 
quality attributes: amino acid sequence, pegylation site and linker composition, mass-average molecular 
weight  and  molecular-weight  dispersity,  free  thiols,  secondary  structure,  disulfide  linkages,  structural 
dynamics,  melting  temperature,  sedimentation  coefficient,  protein  structure,  extinction  coefficient, 
isoelectric point, in vitro potency, receptor binding, receptor binding affinity and kinetics. 
The product-related substances and impurities present in PF-06881894 AS and FP have been investigated 
in  the  FP  lots  used  for  the  biosimilarity  exercise,  including  aged  and  stressed  samples.  These 
substances/impurities  include  oxidation  products,  deamidation  products,  reduced  species,  pegylation 
variants, size variants, isomerisation products and truncated species. For each product-related species 
a  rationale  mainly  based  on  the  scientific  literature  is  provided  for  classifying  it  as  a  product-related 
impurity or substance. The levels of the product-related impurities remain suitably low. 
The potential residual chemicals, leachates and impurities have been identified through a risk 
assessment. These process-related impurities are controlled in FI and/or AS using a combination of 
control elements and demonstrated to be consistently removed to acceptable safety levels by the FI 
and/or AS purification process through process validation studies. In addition, specifications are in 
place for host cell protein (HCP) and residual DNA in the filgrastim intermediate. Specified impurities 
have been present in product studied in clinical trials and are as such clinically qualified with regard to 
safety. 
Specification 
The  specifications  for  the  PF-06881894  AS  include  appropriate  specifications  for  physicochemical 
attributes, identity, potency and purity. Satisfactory justification has been provided for the specifications.  
The AS specifications include a minimal limit for the main peak purity for each of the purity/impurities 
assays. In addition, the AS specifications for impurities include a separate limit for HMW species, 
oxidised and reduced variants. Free PEG content is also part of the AS specifications. The levels of 
cyanide and boron were satisfactorily low and justified. A routine control test for residual cyanide 
content was included in the AS release specification.

Analytical methods 
The analytical procedures have been described, including the system suitability and assay acceptance 
criteria for each method. The non-compendial analytical procedures were properly validated according 
to ICH guidelines. The purpose of the cell-based bioassay analytical procedure is to measure the in vitro 
functional activity of PF-06881894 AS and FP. 
Batch analysis 
A summary of data from 15 AS batches used for nonclinical and clinical studies, stability, engineering 
and development studies and process performance qualification (PPQ) was provided. All AS batches were 
manufactured at the intended commercial AS manufacturing site using the intended commercial-scale 
process.  All  AS  batches  met  the  specifications  applicable  at  the  time  of  AS  release.  The  results 
demonstrate consistent performance of the AS manufacturing process at commercial scale.  
Reference materials 
The applicant has provided an overview of all reference standards for filgrastim intermediate and active 
substance that have been used during development. All standards were properly qualified. Potency was 
qualified against the NIBSC 12/188 pegfilgrastim International Standard (either directly or indirectly). 
Also, qualification programs were proposed for future FI and AS reference standards. The approach how 
new primary reference standards will be qualified is considered satisfactory.  
Container closure 
The PF-06881894 filgrastim intermediate (FI) and PF-06881894 active substance are filled into sterile 
polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG) bottles sealed with high-density polyethylene (HDPE) 
closures. PETG and HDPE resins are compliant with 21 CFR 177.1315(b)(1) and 174.5 and 21 CFR 
176.170(c), 177.1520(c)3.2a, respectively. Both materials met the requirements for USP Class VI 
designation and the USP Cytotoxicity Test. Both materials met the specifications for Physicochemical 
Tests in accordance with USP <661>. PETG bottles with HDPE closure are leak tested. Extractables and 
leachables testing has been performed. From a toxicology point of view, no safety concerns are raised.  
Container closure system suppliers were provided. 
Stability 
Shelf-life and storage conditions for the AS have been proposed and found acceptable.   
The stability program for PF-06881894 AS is conducted in accordance with ICH guidelines for stability of 
AS (ICH Q1A and Q5C) and includes the following studies: long-term at 2 to 8°C (5ºC); accelerated at 
25ºC/60%  RH;  stressed  at  40°C/75%  RH;  3  cycles  of  temperature  cycling  at  25°C/5°C;  3  cycles  of 
temperature cycling at -20°C/5ºC; cold stress at -20°C and photostability, under ICH Q1B Option 2 light 
exposure. 
The  protocols  for  the  stability  studies  are  provided.  The  AS  shelf-life  specification  covers  a  sufficient 
range of stability-indicating tests including tests for specific impurities (high-molecular-weight species-
HMWs, oxidised species, reduced species, total related proteins) and purity (main peak). Polysorbate 20, 
bacterial endotoxins test, and bioburden are part of the AS shelf-life specification too. Data from these 
stability studies support the proposed AS shelf-life. All AS stability batches were manufactured using the 
intended commercial scale AS manufacturing process at the commercial manufacturing site. 
Long-term,  real  time  stability  data  has  been  provided.  All  results  comply  with  the  specifications.  The 
available long-term stability data demonstrate that PF-06881894 AS is stable for the proposed shelf life 
and storage conditions.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/603684/2020

Accelerated  stability  data  has  been  provided.  One  batch  of  PF-06881894  AS  is  included  in  the 
temperature  cycling  (25°C/5°C)  study,  in  the  temperature  cycling  (-20°C/5°C)  study  and  in  the  cold 
stress (-20°C) study. Temperature cycling between recommended storage and 25°C (3 cycles) did not 
impact the AS quality. Temperature cycling between recommended storage and -20°C (3 cycles) did not 
impact the AS quality. Cold stress of -20°C did not impact the AS quality. 
The  data  from  the  photostability  studies  demonstrate  that  unprotected  AS  is  susceptible  to  photo-
degradation  under  ICH  Q1B  (option  2)  photostability  conditions,  in  combination  with  accelerated 
temperature conditions. 
The proposed shelf life at the proposed storage conditions are accepted for the AS. 
2.1.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The PF-06881894 finished product (FP) is developed as a proposed biosimilar to the authorised 
Neulasta reference medicinal product. All excipients (sodium acetate trihydrate, glacial acetic acid, 
sorbitol (E420), polysorbate 20, water for injections) are of compendial grade and controlled according 
to the Ph. Eur. No excipients of human or animal origin nor novel excipients are used for the 
manufacturing process of PF-06881894. To deliver a dosage of 6 mg in 0.6 mL, a target fill volume of 
0.627 mL was determined to be appropriate. There are no overages. 
The  PF-06881894  FP  presentation  dose  strength  is  developed  to  match  the  reference  product's 
configuration  of  6  mg/0.6  mL,  utilising  the  same  protein  concentration  of  10  mg/mL.  Supportive 
formulation development studies and compatibility studies were performed.  
The manufacturing site, final formulation composition and manufacturing process utilised throughout the 
development, clinical campaign and validation are representative of the proposed commercial process 
and therefore data from these are relevant for the commercial process without requiring comparability 
data. Up to date, 10 different batches have been manufactured. 
The  quality  target  product  profile  (QTPP)  was  developed  based  on  the  PF-06881894  FP  development 
studies,  including  the  product  attributes  relevant  to  similarity  and  expectations  for  pharmaceutical 
acceptability.  The  strategy  used  for  process  control  and  categorisation  of  process  parameters  was 
explained by the applicant. It is indicated that within the overall approach to control strategy both critical 
process parameters (CPPs) and non-critical process parameters (non-CPPs) have a high degree of control 
within site quality systems, irrespective of the criticality designation. Normal operating ranges (NORs) 
are detailed in the batch record and any excursions from the NOR for both critical and non-critical process 
parameters  trigger  an  investigation.  Individual  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  are  sufficiently 
controlled. Process development included studies designed to understand the pooling and mixing of AS, 
hold time in the compounding tank pre-bioburden filtration, the hold time in transfer tank post bioburden 
filtration,  sterile  filtration,  the  hold  time  in  ethylene  vinyl  acetate  bags  (EVA),  aseptic  filling  and 
stoppering and visual inspection. Summary results of these studies support the proposed process design. 
The compatibility of materials used and the container closure system has been confirmed. 
The comprehensive risk assessment to identify potential risk factors for nitrosamine formation in the 
active substance, finished product and primary packaging processes, identified no risk for small 
molecule nitrosamine (cohort of concern) formation. Additionally, from a toxicological perspective, 
there is no risk of the pegfilgrastim molecule itself forming a nitrosamine, requiring cohort of concern 
control.

Container closure 
The container closure system was described and meets the requirements of Ph. Eur. The PF-06881894 
finished  product  (FP)  is  supplied  in  6  mg/0.6  mL  single-use  prefilled  syringe  (PFS)  for  manual 
subcutaneous injection. The PF-06881894 PFS is comprised of a glass syringe barrel with a 27-gauge ½-
inch staked needle and a rigid needle shield (RNS, or needle cover), a plunger stopper, a plunger rod 
with a thumb pad, and a passive needle guard (safety device) with finger grips and an inspection window 
allowing for visual inspection of the syringe. 
Extractables studies were performed with no safety concern observed. The results for potential 
leachables were below the LOQ for all compounds identified. Information on the sterilisation of the 
container closure material was submitted as requested by EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/850374/2015. The 
applicant provided information that the UltraSafe Plunger Rod and Needle Guard (safety device) are no 
longer CE-marked due to BD’s decision to withdraw the CE mark for their UltraSafe products and 
therefore these medical device components are required to comply with the Essential Requirements as 
outlined in Annex I of the Medical Devices Directive (93/42/EEC). The applicant provided an overview 
(e.g. checklist) of the applicable requirements, accompanied by relevant data reports demonstrating 
their compliance. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Hospira Zagreb d.o.o (a Pfizer Company) is the site that is responsible for batch release. Adequate GMP 
authorisation is provided for this site.  
The nominal formulation strength for the FP is 10 mg/mL. Unless otherwise specified, the manufacturing 
process steps occur at controlled room temperature (15 to 25°C) during batch manufacture. Preparation 
of  formulation  buffer  (Step  1):  The  formulation  buffer  is  compounded  with  the  same  excipients  and 
excipient concentrations as the finished product, to use for flushing the filters prior to introducing the FP 
to the filter membrane for both the bioburden reduction and sterile filtration steps. 
Preparation of PF-06881894 FP solution (Step 2): PF-06881894 AS, stored in polyethylene terephthalate 
glycol (PETG) bottles at 2 to 8°C, is transferred to the compounding area. Up to two different lots of AS 
may be included in the manufacture of one FP lot. The PF-06881894 AS is pooled and mixed to prepare 
the FP solution which can be held in a stainless-steel vessel for up to 24 hours at room temperature. 
Bioburden reduction filtration (Step 3): The PF-06881894 FP solution is transferred through a sterile 0.2 
μm bioburden reduction filter into a stainless-steel transfer vessel. 
Sterile filtration (Step 4): The PF-06881894 transfer-filtered FP solution is sterile-filtered using two 0.2 
μm single-use filters. 
Aseptic filling and plunger stoppering (Step 5): The containers and closures used for filling and stoppering 
are received  from the supplier as sterile, ready to use and this process is performed under class 100 
conditions.  Visual  inspection  (Step  6)  and  secondary  packaging  (Step  7)  follow.  The  PF-06881894  FP 
units  are  labelled,  assembled  with  the  plunger  rod  and  safety  device  and  packaged  into  cartons.  The 
shelf cartons are then packed and transferred to the warehouse for storage at 2 to 8°C (Step 8). The 
final finished product is shipped under validated qualified conditions. 
There are no reprocessing steps for the manufacture of PF-06881894 FP. In-process tests with associated 
control limits for the PF-06881894 FP manufacturing process are provided. 
A total of 3 PPQ lots of PF-06881894 FP were manufactured as part of the FP process validation program. 
All lots met the pre-defined acceptance criteria for the critical process parameters (CPPs), non-critical 
process parameters (non-CPPs), in-process testing, and critical quality attributes (CQAs) identified for

the manufacturing process. These results demonstrate the capability to reproducibly manufacture FP and 
show that the manufacturing process is under control. 
The applicant provided justification with regards to the process control strategy including categorisation 
of  individual  process  parameters  and  in-process  controls.  There  is  no  criticality  categorisation  of  in-
process controls but their acceptance criteria are defined and a decision of potential batch rejection is 
based on evaluation of any deviation. The only rejection parameter is filter integrity.  
In-process hold times for PF-06881894 FP manufacturing have been justified through development 
activities and additional qualification studies. Fill uniformity studies (3 lots) demonstrate consistency of 
product quality of the filled syringes throughout the duration of the aseptic filling operations. All test 
results passed pre-determined acceptance criteria. Aseptic process simulations (media fills) are 
performed twice a year to (re-) validate the filling process. Shipping of FP has been validated. 
Product specification 
The specification includes appropriate tests for physico-chemical attributes, identity, purity and potency. 
Suitable  justification  was  provided  for  the  specifications.  The  specifications  are  deemed  sufficient  to 
control the quality of the FP.  
A few ‘other concerns’ were raised regarding the proposed acceptance criteria during the procedure and 
the  proposed  finished  product  specifications  were  amended.  As  regards  purity,  individual  types  of 
product-related impurities (such as HMWS or oxidised and reduced specifies) are monitored separately 
and main peak representation is now included. Furthermore, the specification range for osmolality was 
tightened. Due to the specificity of the finished product process (only blending), no new impurities are 
introduced in the finished product  compared  to active substance. Elemental impurities in the FP have 
been addressed. All elements for five PPQ batches were below the 30% of the permitted daily exposure 
(PDE) concentration limits as specified in ICH Q3D. 
Analytical methods 
Analytical methods, their evaluation and acceptance criteria have been changed during the development. 
These changes are supported by submitted validation data. Non-compendial methods are similar for AS 
and FP (see active substance section), except for container closure integrity testing (CCIT), and syringe 
function.  The  latter  two  methods  were  described  and  properly  validated  in  accordance  with  ICH 
guidelines. 
Batch analysis 
All  FP  lots  were  produced  at  the  intended  commercial  FP  manufacturing  site  using  the  intended 
commercial-scale process and in the intended product-contact commercial container closure system with 
the exception of final syringe assembly (i.e., non-product contact components such as the plunger rod 
and needle guard).  
The batch analysis results for FP lots released using the clinical and process performance qualification 
(PPQ)  specification  test  methods  in  place  at  the  time  are  presented  and  show  compliance  with  the 
specifications. 
Reference materials 
The same reference standard is used for the FP and the AS (See AS section).

Stability of the product 
A shelf-life of 36 months at 5°C +/- 3°C is proposed for the FP. 
The stability program for PF-06881894 FP is conducted in accordance with ICH guidelines for stability 
(ICH  Q1A  and  Q5C)  and  includes  the  following  studies:  long-term  at  2  to  8°C  (5°C);  accelerated  at 
25°C/60% relative humidity (RH); stressed at 40°C/75% RH; in-use at 25°C/60% RH post long-term 
storage  at  5°C;  3  cycles  of  temperature  cycling  at  25°C/5°C;  3  cycles  of  temperature  cycling  at  -
20°C/5°C; cold stress at -20°C; photostability under ICH Q1B Option 2 light exposure and photostability 
under manufacturing light exposure. 
The stability data provide justification for the proposed shelf-life of 36 months for PF-06881894 FP stored 
at  the  long-term  storage  condition  of  5°C.  PF-06881894  FP  lots  were  placed  on  the  long-term  5°C 
stability  program  and  there  is  a  minimum  of  36  months  of  stability  data  available.  Suitable  stability-
indicating tests were used. There was no substantial change observed for any quality attribute. All PF-
06881894  FP  stability  lots  were  manufactured  using  the  commercial-scale  FP  manufacturing  process, 
and  all  stability  data  generated  to  date  at  the  long-term  5°C  storage  condition  meet  the  proposed 
commercial PF-06881894 FP specifications. Changes introduced in the finished product specifications are 
reflected in the stability studies adequately. 
In addition, stability data demonstrated that PF-06881894 FP is stable for the proposed in-use storage. 
Exposure of PF-06881894 FP placed in the representative secondary packaging demonstrated that the 
packaged PFS is stable to light exposure. However, the approved conditions as stated in the SmPC are: 
‘Store in a refrigerator (2°C – 8°C). Nyvepria may be exposed to room temperature (not above 25°C) 
for a maximum single period of up to 15 days. Nyvepria left at room temperature for more than 15 days 
should be discarded. Do not freeze. Accidental exposure to freezing temperatures for a single period of 
less than 24 hours does not adversely affect the stability of Nyvepria. Keep the container in the outer 
carton in order to protect from light. ‘ 
Based on the available stability data, the shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC are 
acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No raw materials or excipients of biological origin are employed in the manufacture of AS and FP. The 
active substance is expressed in E. coli which does not support replication of mammalian viruses. The E. 
coli MCB and WCB were tested for the presence of non-lysogenic and lysogenic bacteriophages which 
may replicate in E. coli. Controls at various process stages provide for an adequate control of potential 
bacterial  and  fungal  contaminations.  In  summary,  the  information  provided  on  adventitious  agents  is 
considered acceptable. FP is tested for sterility and bacterial endotoxins. 
2.1.4.  Biosimilarity 
A comprehensive bioanalytical approach was used to assess the similarity of PF-06881894 to the US-
licensed Neulasta Reference Medicinal Product (RP; referred to as pegfilgrastim-US) and the EU-approved 
Neulasta  RP  (referred  to  as  pegfilgrastim-EU)  as  well  as  the  similarity  between  pegfilgrastim-US  and 
pegfilgrastim-EU. 
The scope of the analytical similarity assessment included comparative testing of 17 lots of pegfilgrastim-
US and 17 lots of pegfilgrastim-EU procured over time and 10 lots of PF-06881894 FP. Details of the US 
and EU reference product lots are given in Table 1. All 10 PF-06881894 lots are independent FP lots

manufactured  from  different  AS  batches  and  unique  filgrastim  intermediate  (FI)  batches  using  the 
proposed commercial-scale manufacturing process at the intended commercial FP manufacturing site.

The criteria for assessing the similarity between PF-06881894, pegfilgrastim-US, and pegfilgrastim-EU 
were  developed  based  on  the  pegfilgrastim-US  and  pegfilgrastim-EU  product  information,  both 
qualitative  and  quantitative.  Pegfilgrastim-US  and  pegfilgrastim-EU  lots  acquired  on  the  open  market 
during  PF-06881894  product  development  provide  visibility  to  the  quality  attributes  and  their  ranges 
known  to  be  safe  and  efficacious.  This  information  was  used  to  develop  criteria  for  assessing  the 
analytical similarity of PF-06881894, pegfilgrastim-US, and pegfilgrastim-EU for each quality attribute.

Multiple orthogonal analytical characterization and routine methods were used to assess eachof these 
quality  attributes.  For  quantitative  attributes  critical  to  similarity  assessment,  the  quality  range  and 
acceptable  criterion  was  established.  (i.e.  melting  temperature,  total  related  proteins,  total  charge 
variants, protein concentration, deliverable content, in-vitro potency, receptor binding assay, Receptor 
Binding Affinity Relative KD). For other attributes, a graphical comparison approach was introduced. The 
described strategy is acceptable. The proposed acceptance criterion (90% of tested values need to fall 
within the quality range) is not justified in context of the wide quality range based on mean plus/minus 
three  times  standard  deviation  (3-sigma  interval).  However,  the  provided  data  overall,  support  the 
analytical  similarity  among  PF-06881894,  pegfilgrastim-US  and  pegfilgrastim-EU  and  therefore  no 
further discussion was requested regarding the proposed statistical acceptance criterion.

A  comprehensive  analysis  of  the  primary  structure  was  performed.  The  results  provided  demonstrate 
that  the  amino  acid  sequence  is  identical  between  PF-06881894  and  the  EU-  and  US-sourced  RP  and 
consistent with the theoretical pegfilgrastim amino acid sequence. In addition, analysis of the pegylation 
site, linker composition, intact mass, free thiol and isoelectric point (pI) also confirm consistency between 
all lots analysed. A missing qualification report for non-reduced peptide mapping method for disulfide 
mapping analysis was provided by the applicant upon request.  
It is noted that a minor shift to higher molecular weight (MW) is observed in PF-06881894 (i.e. ~0.3 to 
0.4 kDa), which is attributable to small differences in the mPEG moiety. This is not considered to have a 
clinical impact. In addition, molecular-weight dispersity and mPEG mass distribution were similar. Based 
on these data, the observed small differences in MW are considered sufficiently justified. 
Analysis  of  the  higher  order  structure  showed  that  the  pegfilgrastim  secondary  structure  by  far-UV 
circular dichroism (CD) is consistent between PF-06881894 and the EU- and US-sourced RP, which is 
predominantly  α-helical.  The  expected  intramolecular  disulfide  bonds  are  identical  in  PF-06881894, 
pegfilgrastim-EU, and pegfilgrastim-US. The tertiary structures are demonstrated to be similar based on 
similarity  of  melting  temperature,  deuterium  uptake,  and  sedimentation  coefficient  of  pegfilgrastim 
monomer.  The  overlays  of  the  1D  and  2D  NMR  spectra  of  all  PF-06881894,  pegfilgrastim-US,  and

pegfilgrastim-EU lots tested were also similar. These results confirm that the pegfilgrastim protein in PF-
06881894,  pegfilgrastim-EU,  and  pegfilgrastim-US  have  a  high  degree  of  similarity  in  higher  order 
structure. 
Analysis of product-related substances and impurities showed that the levels of total related proteins, 
total charge variants, total size variants, Met127 oxidation, and deamidated species are slightly lower in 
PF-06881894 as compared to the levels observed in pegfilgrastim-EU and pegfilgrastim-US, which were 
similar. On the other hand, levels of other HMWS, des-pegylated species, total size variants, residual 
PEG, Trp59 oxidation, Gln108 deamidation, reduced species, N-terminal des-pegylated species and other 
low abundant pegfilgrastim-related species were comparable between PF-06881894 and both EU- and 
US-sourced RP. In addition, apart from determination of total related proteins, total charge variants and 
total size variants, the applicant also measured the levels of individual product-related substances and 
impurities.  However,  evaluation  of  individual  size  variants  was  requested,  to  further  support  the 
biosimilarity  claim.  The  applicant  differentiated  the  individual  size  variants  and  performed  similarity 
assessment  for  individual  variants.  Based  on  the  provided summary,  other  HMWS  and  Des-pegylated 
species  were  similarly  low  for  all  PF-06881894,  pegfilgrastim-US,  and  pegfilgrastim-EU  lots.  dimer  in 
pegfilgrastim-US and pegfilgrastim-EU are similar, PF-06881894  lots have consistently lower levels of 
dimer.   
Early  PF-06881894  FP  lots  had  a  slightly  higher  protein  concentration  and  slightly  lower  deliverable 
volume  than  pegfilgrastim-EU  and  pegfilgrastim-US  lots.  The  manufacturing  process  was  therefore 
slightly adjusted with regards to target protein concentration and fill weights to better match the strength 
of the RP. Hence, PF-06881894 FP lots produced after these adjustments are more similar to the EU- 
and US-sourced RP. Importantly, all lots of PF-06881894 showed consistent deliverable content similar 
to  the  lots  of  EU-  and  US-sourced  RP.  All  other  FP  attributes  (i.e.  appearance,  colour,  clarity,  pH, 
osmolality, polysorbate 20 content, and visible particles) are demonstrated  to be similar between PF-
06881894 and pegfilgrastim-EU and pegfilgrastim-US, with the exception of subvisible particles content, 
which appears to be lower in PF-06881894. Although there are some very small differences, the results 
confirm that the pegfilgrastim FP in PF-06881894, pegfilgrastim-EU, and pegfilgrastim-US have a similar 
quality profile regarding the FP attributes tested. 
The  functional  activity  of  pegfilgrastim  in  PF-06881894  is  similar  to  that  of  pegfilgrastim-EU  and 
pegfilgrastim-US,  as  demonstrated  by  generally  comparable  means  and  ranges  for  in  vitro  potency, 
relative (receptor binding) potency, and receptor binding affinity and kinetics. In addition, overlays of 
receptor  binding  kinetic  curves  of  PF-06881894,  pegfilgrastim-US,  and  pegfilgrastim-EU  were  also 
similar. 
In  support  of  the  analytical  similarity  study  between  PF-06881894  and  the  RP,  the  applicant  also 
performed comparative stability studies at long-term (5 °C), accelerated (25 °C/60% RH), and stressed 
(40  °C/75%  RH)  storage  conditions,  as  well  as  comparative  forced  degradation  studies  induced  by 
peroxide, heat, light or high pH. Based on the results presented, it can be concluded that the stability 
data obtained at long-term, accelerated and stressed conditions are comparable with regards to the rates 
and routes of degradation between PF-06881894, pegfilgrastim-US and pegfilgrastim-EU. 
Upon request, the applicant submitted analytical reports and raw data package for representative lots 
tested in the analytical similarity assessment and comparative stability studies. Analytical data for SEC, 
IC-HPLC, RP-HPLC methods and response curves for potency and binding assays were provided and the 
data support the overall conclusion on biosimilarity as discussed in the quality assessment report.  
The provided data were highly consistent between Nyvepria and reference products, with the exception 
of total charge variants analysis. The recently produced Nyvepria lots have reduced content of total 
charged variants (predominantly deamidated species recognised as impurities) compared to the 
reference product and other Nyvepria lots. These differences were considered minor and without

practical influence on safety or efficacy. In conclusion, biosimilarity can be considered demonstrated, 
all remaining other concerns on biosimilarity have been solved. 
2.1.5.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
One major objection related to the QP declaration / GMP compliance of the active substance was 
satisfactorily solved. An updated QP declaration was provided.  
All other concerns were also satisfactory solved. However, the applicant is asked to provide the 
validation data of the pooling of up to two PF-06881894 filgrastim intermediate batches upon 
availability (see recommendation). The AS and FP manufacturing process and process controls are 
described in detail. Control of raw materials is adequately performed. A cell bank system consisting of 
MCB and WCB was established and tested and qualified. As regards the critical intermediate mPEG-p, 
the applicant has provided detailed information on the process and controls. The manufacturing 
process was appropriately validated. The AS and FP specifications proposed by the applicant are 
deemed suitable to control the quality of AS and FP. Analytical methods were described in detail. AS 
and FP specifications are properly justified.  
The available long-term stability data demonstrate that PF-06881894 AS is stable for the proposed 
shelf life at the proposed storage condition, and that PF-06881894 FP is stable for up to 36 months 
when stored at 5°C. Accordingly, the proposed shelf lives are deemed acceptable. 
Biosimilarity analysis 
For the biosimilarity analysis, the applicant performed an extensive comparability exercise including 
side-by-side testing using a combination of orthogonal analytical methods, which were properly 
qualified, and by using up to 17 batches of pegfilgrastim-EU and pegfilgrastim-US and 10 batches of 
Nyvepria FP. 
In general, all quality attributes analysed proved to be highly similar between Nyvepria and both EU- 
and US-sourced Neulasta. A minor shift to higher molecular weight is observed for the PEG moiety, 
which is attributable to mPEG lot-to-lot variability. However, molecular weight dispersity and mPEG 
mass distribution were similar between Nyvepria and the RP, confirming that the minor shift is unlikely 
to have any clinical impact. Furthermore, secondary and tertiary structures are demonstrated to be 
consistent and highly similar between Nyvepria and both EU- and US-sourced Neulasta. Product-
related substances and impurities appeared to be slightly higher in both EU- and US-sourced Neulasta 
compared to Nyvepria, especially with regards to total related proteins (due to lower levels of Met127 
oxidation and deamidation), total charge variants (due to lower levels of deamidation) and total size 
variants (due to lower levels of dimers). Based on the data presented, the lower levels of product-
related substances and impurities rather suggest that Nyvepria has a higher purity profile. HMWS B 
(dimers) level was found to be consistently lower for Nyvepria compared to pegfilgrastim-US and 
pegfilgrastim-EU and as a result, total size variants were also consistently lower in Nyvepria samples. 
In general, the differences observed were small and not considered clinically relevant. In addition, 
comparative stability and forced degradation studies, comparison of other finished product attributes 
and in vitro potency, relative potency, and receptor binding affinity and kinetics were highly similar for 
Nyvepria and both EU- and US-sourced Neulasta. These data further confirm that the pegfilgrastim 
protein in Nyvepria, EU- and US-sourced Neulasta have similar higher order structure and functional 
conformation, which is required for biological activity. In conclusion, the data derived from these 
studies demonstrated similarity to the reference medicinal products.

2.1.6.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. The data 
derived from the biosimilarity studies demonstrated similarity of Nyvepria to the reference medicinal 
products at the quality level.

2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The nonclinical programme of PF-06881894 also referred to as HSP-130, Hospira Pegylated G-CSF, PegG-
CSF HSP, and Pegfilgrastim included a series of in vitro comparative studies. The assays used comprised 
of an in vitro cell-based proliferation assay, a competitive receptor binding assay, and a Surface Plasmon 
Resonance (Biacore) assay for determination of receptor binding affinity (K D and Relative K D) and the 
binding rate kinetics (k on and k off). Please see the Quality part above with regards to the details on 
the assessment.  
In vivo pharmacological activity of PF-06881894 was assessed as part of the 4-week comparative toxicity 
study in CD [Crl:CD (SD)] rats (Study 1550-064).  
The  nonclinical  toxicology  program  consisted  of  a  GLP-compliant  comparative  4-week,  repeat-dose 
subcutaneous (SC) toxicity study of PF-06881894, pegfilgrastim-US, and pegfilgrastim-EU. 
Rats were selected as an appropriate test species for providing a meaningful toxicological and similarity 
comparison between PF-06881894 and the pegfilgrastim-US or pegfilgrastim-EU reference products 
based on the pharmacological relevance established from the Originator’s nonclinical experience. Pfizer 
conducted a Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)-compliant, 4-week repeat-dose subcutaneous (SC) 
comparative toxicity study with a 6-week recovery period in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, with PF-
06881894, pegfilgrastim-US and pegfilgrastim-EU, along with a concurrent control. The subcutaneous 
route was selected as it is the approved clinical route of administration for Neulasta 9, and consistent 
with the route of administration evaluated in the nonclinical toxicology program with pegfilgrastim. This 
study used PF-06881894 manufactured at the same scale and process used to manufacture clinical lots

of PF-06881894, thereby maximising the relevance of the nonclinical study to the clinical development 
program. In this nonclinical study, the potential toxicity, toxicokinetics (TK), pharmacodynamics (PD), 
including measurement of absolute neutrophil count [ANC], a well-established biomarker for G-CSF 
treatment), local tolerance, and immunogenicity (ADA, anti-pegfilgrastim antibodies) of PF-06881894, 
pegfilgrastim-US or pegfilgrastim-EU were characterised for an evaluation of comparability. 
2.2.2.  Pharmacology 
Several complementary functional assays were utilised to assess pegfilgrastim biological activity as part 
of  the  PF-06881894  analytical  similarity  assessment.  The  assays  used  included  an  in  vitro  cell-based 
proliferation assay, a competitive receptor binding assay, and a Surface Plasmon Resonance (Biacore) 
assay for determination of receptor binding affinity (K D and Relative K D) and the binding rate kinetics 
(k on and k off). 
In vivo pharmacological activity of PF-06881894 was assessed as part of the 4-week comparative toxicity 
study in CD [Crl:CD (SD)] rats (Study 1550-064). In rats, the magnitude of the changes in total leukocyte 
and  neutrophil  counts  were  similar  at  comparable  doses  of  PF-06881894,  pegfilgrastim-US  or 
pegfilgrastim-EU indicating expected pharmacological effect. 
No secondary pharmacodynamic, safety and pharmacodynamic drug interactions studies were 
conducted. 
2.2.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Toxicokinetic and anti-drug antibody (ADA, anti-pegfilgrastim antibodies) evaluations were conducted as 
part of a 4-week repeat-dose comparative toxicity study in SD rats with PF-06881894, pegfilgrastim-US, 
and pegfilgrastim-EU (Study 1550-064).  
The  bioanalytical  method  used  to  determine  the  serum  concentrations  of  pegfilgrastim  in  rat  was  a 
commercially  available  enzyme-linked  immunosorbent  assay  (ELISA)  kit  designed  for  the  quantitative 
determination of G-CSF. Overall, the ELISA method for the quantitation of pegylated G-CSF in rat serum 
is considered as successfully validated and suitable for intended use. 
The qualitative immunoassay method used to screen rat serum for the presence of anti-pegfilgrastim 
antibodies (ADA) was validated at ICON Development Solutions in accordance with 21 CFR 58 GLP as it 
applies to bioanalysis. The method of cut point assessment is considered adequate. Overall, the method 
for the screening of anti-human PEG G-CSF in rat serum is considered as properly set up and validated. 
Two  apparent  outliers  were  excluded  from  pharmacokinetic  comparison  of  biosimilarity  ratio  between 
products. Rationale for exclusion and calculation of the ratio with and without concerning animal data 
was provided in the study report and this approach is agreed. The group mean AUC 0-120hr exposure 
ratios between pegfilgrastim-US or pegfilgrastim-EU and PF-06881894 on Day 1 ranged from 0.921 to 
1.17 and on Day 29, from 0.869 to 1.23. The pegfilgrastim exposure was independent of sex, AUC 0-
120hr and C max values increased with increasing dose in a greater than dose-proportional manner on 
Days  1  and  29  and  was  similar  between  treatments  groups  at  the  same  dose  level  treated  with  PF-
06881894,  pegfilgrastim-US  or  pegfilgrastim-EU.  From  non-clinical  perspective  similarity  in  PK  profile 
has been sufficiently demonstrated.  
The  presence  of  anti-pegfilgrastim  ADA  increased  over  time  following  repeated  administration  and 
appeared to impact systemic exposure to PF-06881894, US-licensed Neulasta, and EU-licensed Neulasta 
for  several  animals  on  Day  29.  However,  there  was  no  apparent  correlation  between  dose  and  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/603684/2020  
Page 31/82 
 
 
 
incidence  of  animals  with  anti-pegfilgrastim  ADA  or  between  test  article  (PF-06881894,  US-licensed 
Neulasta and EU-licensed Neulasta) and the incidence of animals with anti-pegfilgrastim ADA. 
End point titer (EPT) values in several animals suggests that the presence of ADA at a sufficient titre 
may impact systemic exposure to pegfilgrastim. However, no significant differences in total incidence of 
anti-pegfilgrastim ADA has been observed between PF-06881894, pegfilgrastim-US and pegfilgrastim-
EU and calculated PK biosimilar ratio has not been influenced. 
There are no distribution, metabolism, excretion or additional studies provided by the applicant and 
those studies are not needed for testing of biosimilars. 
2.2.4.  Toxicology 
Single-dose toxicity studies with PF-06881894 have not been conducted. This is in alignment with 
relevant biosimilar guidelines.  
The  nonclinical  toxicology  program  consisted  of  a  GLP-compliant  comparative  4-week,  repeat-dose 
subcutaneous (SC) toxicity study of PF-06881894, pegfilgrastim-US, and pegfilgrastim-EU. 
The  comparative  repeat-dose  toxicity  study  was  conducted  with  PF-06881894  drug  substance  Batch 
PFS01P/14. This lot was manufactured at the same scale and using the same process as the clinical PF-
06881894 Drug Substance lots.  
The doses of 200 and 1800 μg/kg for this comparative toxicity study were selected by the applicant to 
match previous nonclinical toxicity studies (sub-chronic) of PF-06881894 in the rodent. PF-06881894 is 
a recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor analogue of filgrastim, which increases the 
body’s production of neutrophils. PF-06881894 was expected to produce dose-responsive pharmacologic 
effects to the haematopoietic system as detailed below without causing adverse effects. In MPI Research 
Study Number 1550-051, PF-06881894 was administered to rats weekly by subcutaneous injection for 
4  weeks  at  200,  600,  or  1800  μg/kg/dose  followed  by  a  4-week  recovery.  All  dose  levels  were  well 
tolerated  with  no  definitive  adverse  findings.  The  primary  treatment  related  findings  were  associated 
with expected pharmacology of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), which included a dose-
responsive  increase  in  leukocytes  (mainly  neutrophils),  an  increase  in  M:E  ratio,  and  increased 
haematopoiesis in bone marrow, spleen, and liver. 
In  rats,  GLP study  included  assessment  of  toxicity based  on  mortality,  cageside,  clinical,  dermal,  and 
ophthalmoscopic observations, body weight and food consumption, and clinical and anatomic pathology. 
Toxicokinetic (TK) assessment was conducted for the test articles. Immunogenicity (anti-pegfilgrastim 
antibody) assessment was also conducted. 
In general, study design, followed parameters, doses, route of administration, species and duration of 
treatment was adequately chosen to address the potential differences between concerned products.  
Overall,  there  were  no  differences  noted  in  the  severity  or  incidence  of  microscopic  changes  among 
groups given PF-06881894, US-licensed Neulasta, or EU-licensed Neulasta once weekly (for a total of 
five doses) at each respective dose. All test article-related microscopic effects were reversible, considered 
to be related to the pharmacological activity of the test articles, and were not considered to be adverse. 
Reproduction toxicology, genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies were not conducted as these are not 
routine requirements to demonstrate similarity of biological medicinal products containing recombinant 
G-CSF as active substance.  
No stand-alone studies have been conducted to evaluate the local tolerance in line with the guideline on 
local  tolerance.  There  were  no  differences  noted  in  the  severity  or  incidences  of  microscopic  changes 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/603684/2020  
Page 32/82 
 
 
 
between  treatment  groups  at  the  same  dose  level  treated  with  PF  06881894,  pegfilgrastim-US  or 
pegfilgrastim EU. 
PF-06881894 was previously developed as a new biologic entity with prior supportive noncomparative 
nonclinical  studies  completed  to  enable  the  conduct  of  a  clinical  development  program.  The 
noncomparative data provided do not indicate different toxicity profile in comparison to reference product 
Neulasta (EPAR) or those in the comparative four-week toxicity study in rats. 
End point titre (EPT) values in several animals suggests that the presence of ADA at a sufficient titre 
may impact systemic exposure to pegfilgrastim. However, no significant differences in total incidence 
of anti-pegfilgrastim ADA has been observed between PF-06881894, pegfilgrastim-US and 
pegfilgrastim-EU and calculated PK biosimilar ratio has not been influenced. 
2.2.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No ERA studies were provided with reference to the guideline on the environmental risk assessment of 
medicinal products for human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 Corr 2).  
Conjugated PEG component is commonly used, considered safe and represents no additional 
environmental risk. Regarding the fact that the active substance pegfilgrastim is a polypeptide which is 
expected to be largely metabolised after administration and easily biodegraded in the environment, the 
omission of ERA studies indeed can be accepted as described in above mentioned guideline. A 
biosimilar, pegfilgrastim is already used in existing marketed products and no significant increase in 
environmental exposure is anticipated. Therefore, pegfilgrastim is not expected to raise a risk to the 
environment. The justification provided is adequate. 
2.2.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Non-clinical  scientific  advice  was  requested  from  CHMP  regarding  to  comparative  4-week  repeat-dose 
study (1550-064) in rats in 2017. The study was considered by CHMP as adequate and sufficient as the

package 
according 
to 
EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/31329/2005:  Biosimilar  medicinal  products  containing  recombinant  granulocyte-
colony  stimulating  factor  (Annex  to  guideline  on  similar  biological  medicinal  products  containing 
biotechnology-derived  proteins  as  active  substance:  non-clinical  and  clinical  issues).  Specifically,  no 
reproductive/development /carcinogenicity studies or to demonstrate the pharmacodynamic (PD) effect 
of PF-06881894 in separate non-neutropenic and neutropenic in vivo animal models were proposed and 
conducted. This is adequate.  
The  pharmacological  activity  of  PF-06881894  was  consequently  assessed  as  part  of  the  4-week 
comparative  toxicity  study  in  CD  [Crl:CD  (SD)]  rats  (Study  1550-064).  In  rats,  the  magnitude  of  the 
changes  in  total  leukocyte  and  neutrophil  counts  were  similar  at  comparable  doses  of  PF-06881894, 
pegfilgrastim-US or pegfilgrastim-EU indicating expected pharmacological effect. 
Toxicokinetic and anti-drug antibody (ADA, anti-pegfilgrastim antibodies) evaluations were conducted as 
part of a 4-week repeat-dose comparative toxicity study in SD rats with PF-06881894, pegfilgrastim-US, 
and pegfilgrastim-EU (Study 1550-064). From non-clinical perspective similarity in PK profile has been 
sufficiently demonstrated.  
Reproduction toxicology, genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies were not conducted as these are not 
routine requirements to demonstrate similarity of biological medicinal products containing recombinant 
G-CSF as active substance.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/603684/2020  
Page 33/82 
 
 
 
No  stand-alone  studies  have  been  conducted  to  evaluate  the  local  tolerance.  This  is  considered 
acceptable as it is in line with the guideline on local tolerance. There were no differences noted in the 
severity or incidences of microscopic changes between treatment groups at the same dose level treated 
with PF 06881894, pegfilgrastim-US or pegfilgrastim EU. 
With regards to the environmental risk assessment, pegfilgrastim is not expected to raise a risk to the 
environment. 
2.2.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
From a non-clinical point of view, this marketing authorisation application is approvable. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
Community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
The applicant’s investigational drug, PF-06881894 (historically referred to as HSP-130), is a pegylated 
recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) that is currently being developed as 
a proposed biosimilar to Neulasta (pegfilgrastim). 
PF-06881894  is  a  covalent  conjugate  of  recombinant  human  methionyl  G-CSF  (met-HuG-CSF,  or 
filgrastim)  and  a  single  methoxypolyethylene  glycol  moiety  of  approximate  20,000  Daltons.  The 
Filgrastim Intermediate is produced in Escherichia coli (E. coli) transformed with a genetically engineered 
plasmid containing the gene sequence encoding the met-HuG-CSF protein product. Commercial forms of 
recombinant  human  G-CSF  (rh-G-CSF)  include  E.  coli-derived  G-CSF,  which  is  non-glycosylated,  e.g. 
filgrastim  (Neupogen,  Amgen)  and  Chinese  hamster  ovary  cell-derived  G-CSF,  which  is  glycosylated, 
e.g. lenograstim (Chugai Pharma). 
Throughout  this  report,  Neulasta  sourced  from  the  US  will  be  referred  to  as  pegfilgrastim-US,  and 
Neulasta sourced from the EU will be referred to as pegfilgrastim-EU. Neulasta is used as a collective 
term  to  indicate  both  pegfilgrastim-US  and  pegfilgrastim-EU  and  pegfilgrastim  is  used  as  a  collective 
term to indicate both PF-06881894 and Neulasta. 
The comparative exercise for clinical similarity assessment included 2 studies in healthy volunteers: a 
randomised single-dose comparative PD/PK study (ZIN-130-1505 [C1221001]; hereafter referred to as 
ZIN-130-1505) comparing PF-06881894 to pegfilgrastim-US and pegfilgrastim-EU ( 
Figure  1);  and  a  comparative  immunogenicity  study  (C1221005)  comparing  PF-06881894  to 
pegfilgrastim-US (Figure 2). The clinical studies and their endpoints for similarity assessments are listed 
in the table below. Both studies were completed at the time of the submission. 
Additionally, as the clinical development program for PF-06881894 was started as a new entity licensure 
pathway, an ascending single- and multiple-dose study in women with non-distantly metastatic breast

cancer  (ZIN-130-1504  [C1221002];  hereafter,  referred  to  as  ZIN-130-1504)  was  conducted.  As  this 
study  was  non-comparative,  it  was  not  considered  integral  to  the  biosimilar  clinical  program  (only 
supportive) and its results will not be described in this report.

Period 2, each subject was to receive 1 SC dose of the same regimen received in Treatment 
Period 1. There was an interval of approximately 1 month between P1D1 and P2D1, which 
was consistent with clinical use of pegfilgrastim-US and its half-life. The duration of

B]) without concomitant or background chemotherapy. Dose-escalation from Regimen A to B was based on safety assessments (vital 
signs, concomitant medications, laboratory assessments, electrocardiogram [ECG], physical examination, and any AEs occurring 
post dose administration through Day 30) in the 6 evaluable subjects receiving Regimen A. Based on these assessments, there was 
no contraindication for dose-escalation and screening for the subsequent dose level (Regimen B) which was subsequently initiated 
(Module 5.3.4.2 ZIN 130 1504 Study Report Body Section 9.1.1) 
d. In Phase 2, a second group of subjects received up to 4 cycles of PF-06881894 (6 mg by SC injection) with concomitant 
background chemotherapy. The 3 mg dose was not included in Phase 2 based on results of Cycle 0 where, as expected, the PD and 
PK results for the 3 mg dose tended to be lower than the results for the 6 mg (Module 5.3.4.2 ZIN 130 1504 Study Report Body 
Section 9.1.2). 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The clinical pharmacology of PF-06881894 was characterised based on the ZIN-130-1505 PD/PK study 
in healthy subjects. 
The  primary  objective  of  the  single-dose  comparative  PD/PK  study  was  to  assess  the  PD  and  PK 
equivalence of PF-06881894 with pegfilgrastim-US and pegfilgrastim-EU administered as a single 6 mg 
SC  dose.  In  addition,  the  assessment  of  safety  (including  immunogenicity)  of  PF-06881894  and 
pegfilgrastim-US and pegfilgrastim-EU was a secondary objective for this study.

Bioanalytical methods 
Pegfilgrastim  concentrations  in  serum  were  determined  using  an  electrochemiluminescence  (ECL) 
immunoassay validated over a calibration range of 100 - 5000 pg/mL at Inventiv Health Clinical Lab, US. 
Samples of subjects dosed with PF-06881894, pegfilgrastim-US or pegfilgrastim-EU were all analysed 
using a calibration curve produced by PF-06881894, which is acceptable as precision and accuracy results 
were similar for the different compounds.  
It was shown that an anti-pegfilgrastim antibody interfered with the measurement of PF-06881894 and 
pegfilgrastim-US.  The  magnitude  of  interference  was  dependent  on  the  concentration  of  the  antibody 
and pegfilgrastim. PK equivalence was shown previously that it was not influenced by the ADA status, 
and the impact of ADA on PK bioequivalence has been further discussed using the ADA confirmatory cut 
point set at 1% false positive rate. Following clarification provided by the applicant regarding the false 
positive rate, it is considered as an acceptable one. The low immunogenicity potential of the product is 
acknowledged. The previously provided results for the Study C1221005 have been updated during the 
evaluation  using  a  confirmatory  CP  of  9.33%  instead  of  8.41%  (which  was  the  CP  for  filgrastim 
specificity). This change resulted in reclassification of data for 3 subjects, with ultimately 20 (10.0%) 
and 24 (12.1%) subjects in the PF 06881894 and pegfilgrastim US groups, respectively, having samples 
that tested positive for anti-pegfilgrastim antibody using a confirmatory CP of 9.33% 
Anti-drug antibody assays 
A  multi-tiered  test  strategy  was  applied  to  evaluate  relative  immunogenicity  of  Pegfilgrastim  (PF-
06881894  or  PF-06881894).  Anti-Pegfilgrastim  and  anti-PEG  antibodies  were  assessed  in  two  parallel 
assays.  Identical  bioanalytical  methods  were  applied  to  studies  ZIN-130-1504,  ZIN-130-1505  and 
C1221005, except for the isotypes determination assay. 
Figure 3: Schematic for multitier immunogenicity sample testing strategy 
Initially,  samples  were  subject  to  a  screening  assay.  The  bridging  assay  format  used  Sulfo-TAG- 
Pegfilgrastim  and  biotinylated  Pegfilgrastim  as  the  labelled  antigens,  and  electrochemiluminescence 
(ECL) detection of complexes of ADA with bridged labelled antigen on streptavidin-coated MSD plates. 
Assessment report

All screened positive samples were tested in a confirmatory assay in the same assay format using excess 
Pegfilgrastim as the competing agent. Confirmed antibody positive samples were then further evaluated 
for Filgrastim specificity before proceeding to measurement of Ab titre using the same ECL assay format. 
The ability of this one-assay approach, using the biosimilar as binding and detection reagents, to detect 
ADA against either Neulasta-US, Neulasta-EU or Pegfilgrastim was confirmed using an affinity-purified 
rabbit  anti-PEG-GCSF  polyclonal  Ab  selected  as  positive  control  Ab.  Pre-study  cut-points  (CP)  were 
established for studies ZIN-130-1504 and ZIN-130-1505 whereas in-study CP were established for study 
C1221005. The reliability of the CP for the study samples has been discussed and is considered reliable 
for the study ZIN-130-1505. For studies ZIN-130-1505 and C1221005, the confirmatory CP was set at 
a 0.1% false-positive rate. As required, the applicant has submitted the immunogenicity results observed 
using the confirmatory CP with a false-positive rate of 1% for the studies (instead of 0.1%). For study 
C1221005,  although  the  number  of  subjects  with  negative  baseline  anti-pegfilgrastim  antibody  and 
confirmed  post-dose  positive  anti-pegfilgrastim  antibody  at  any  visit  increase,  the  number  is  similar 
between  PF-06881894  and  Pegfilgrastim-US.  For  study  ZIN-130-1505,  the  numbers  of  patients  with 
positive anti-pegfilgrastim antibody remain close to the numbers observed with the confirmatory CP with 
a false-positive rate of 0.1%.  
Confirmed anti-Pegfilgrastim antibody positive samples were further assessed for neutralizing capability 
using a cell-based assay and antibody isotypes were determined using two different approaches. 
The presence of NAb in serum samples was evidenced by the G-CSF mediated luminescence inhibition 
in transfected U937 cell line. NAb against Pegfilgrastim were assessed in study C1221005 and against 
both Pegfilgrastim and Filgrastim in study ZIN-130-1505. For the Pegfilgrastim-NAb assay validation, an 
affinity-purified goat anti-hG-CSF polyclonal IgG Ab was selected as the positive control. Reliability of 
the pre-study CP used for the study ZIN-130-1505 was confirmed. Environmental influences on the assay 
performance were assessed.  
Lastly, an ECL-based assay allowing the measurement of anti-Pegfilgrastim IgG and IgM concentrations 
and a surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based assay that allow the identification of Ig subtypes (IgA, 
IgG, IgM) and IgG subclasses were used on positive samples from study C1221005 and study ZIN-130-
1505, respectively. Isotypes assessment was exploratory. 
Detection and characterization of anti-PEG antibodies 
Anti-PEG Ab were measured by ELISA. According to the applicant, this method was found to provide the 
highest sensitivity and specificity to all forms of anti-PEG antibodies tested (IgG, IgM, and pooled human 
anti-sera). The ELISA was validated using a human serum positive and negative control pools. The choice 
of  the  coating  (mono-pegylated  BSA)  and  the  competitive  (methoxy  PEG)  agents  were  deemed 
appropriate.  Regarding  the  design  of  the  assay,  rabbit  anti-Hu  IgG/A/M  and  goat  anti-mouse  IgG  as 
detector Ab were used. The selection of the positive control originating from human samples is supported. 
In-study  CP  was  appropriately  used  in  study  C1221005.  In  the  study  ZIN-130-1505,  the  parametric 
confirmatory cut point (CCP) has been used (72.1% inhibition).

During the course of the study, more than one batch of the reference product was used. The applicant 
showed similar protein content and potency in the used batches.  
Population(s) studied  
A total of 153 subjects were enrolled in the study. Of the enrolled subjects, 142 (92.8%) completed the 
study  and  11  (7.2%)  prematurely  discontinued  from  the  study.  Subject  disposition  is  summarised  in 
Table below. 
Table 4: Subject Disposition – Enrolled Population 
Overall, demographic characteristics were similar among sequence groups. For all subjects randomised, 
52.9% were male and 47.1% were female subjects; the majority of subjects were white (86.3%). The 
age of subjects ranged from 18 to 65 years, with a mean age of 30.4 years. The overall range for subject 
weight was 48.80 to 100.00 kg and BMI was 19.00 to 29.80 kg/m2. 
Analysis Populations: 
Safety Population: All subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug (= 153 subjects). All safety 
analyses will be conducted on the safety population. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/603684/2020

Pharmacodynamic Population: Subjects who receive at least one treatment and have sufficient data to 
calculate the primary PD endpoints of AUECANC and ANC_Cmax. Sufficient data is defined by meeting the 
following criteria: having at least 11 samples for evaluation of AUECANC (must include the pre-dose and 
288 hours post-dose samples) and ANC_Cmax can be reliably determined. Subjects who have confirmed 
positive anti-peg filgrastim (antidrug) antibodies at any time will not be included in the PD Population. 
Sensitivity  analyses  regarding  impact  of  antidrug  antibody  including  subjects  with  confirmed  positive 
anti-peg  filgrastim  antibodies  will  be  performed.  Pharmacodynamic  equivalence  determination  will  be 
made on the PD population. 
Pharmacokinetic  Population:  Subjects  who  receive  at  least  one  treatment  and  have  sufficient  data  to 
calculate  the  primary  pharmacokinetic  parameters  of  Cmax  and  AUC0-inf ·  Sufficient  data  is  defined  by 
meeting  the  following  criteria:  having  at  least  11  samples  for  evaluation  of  AUC0-inf (must  include  the 
pre-dose  and  288  hour  post-dose  samples)  and  Cmax  can  be  reliably  determined.  Subjects  who  have 
confirmed positive anti-pegylated filgrastim (antidrug) antibodies at any time will not be included in the 
PK  Population.  Sensitivity  analyses  regarding  impact  of  antidrug  antibody  including  subjects  with 
confirmed positive anti-pegylated filgrastim antibodies will be performed. The PK population will be the 
primary analysis set for the primary PK analyses. 
A total of 143 subjects, assigned to 1 of the 6 sequence groups, were included in the PK population and 
PD population.  
Of  the  153  enrolled  subjects,  10  subjects  confirmed  positive  for  anti-pegfilgrastim  antibodies  were 
excluded from PD and PK analyses. 
Pharmacokinetic variables 
The PK variables were calculated using non-compartmental methods in Phoenix WinNonlin 
version 6.4. 
The following PK parameters were calculated for each treatment: 
Primary PK Parameter was  
- 
AUC0-inf:  Area  under  the  serum  pegylated  filgrastim  versus  time  curve  from  the  time  of  dose 
administration to time infinity 
-  Cmax: Maximum observed serum pegylated filgrastim concentration, 
Secondary PK Parameters were 
- 
- 
- 
AUC0-t:  Area  under  serum  pegylated  filgrastim  versus  time  curve  from  the  time  of  dose 
administration to the time of last measurable concentration, 
Tmax: The time to maximum serum pegylated filgrastim concentration 
t1/2: Elimination half-life, 
-  λz: Elimination rate constant 
Statistical methods 
The  GMRs  and  CIs  were  obtained  using  analysis  of  variance  (ANOVA)  with  sequence,  period,  and 
treatment  as  factors  for  log-transformed  data.  For  PD  parameters,  baseline  ANC  was  included  in  the 
analysis model as a covariate. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/603684/2020  
Page 44/82 
 
 
 
 
PK equivalence was assessed by constructing the 90% CIs for the GMR (test/reference) for AUC0-inf and 
Cmax. PK equivalence was concluded if the 90% CIs for both AUC0-inf and Cmax were completely contained 
within the acceptance limits of 80%-125%. The same step-down testing for PD variables was performed. 
In addition, the sponsor performed an additional analysis (Supplemental clinical study report) for AUC0-
t. This parameter was also assessed by constructing the 90% CI for the GMR (test/reference). 
Protocol deviations 
No  clinically  relevant  protocol  deviations  were  reported.  The  targeted  56  days  of  wash-out  was  not 
achieved for many subjects, however washout was still minimal 51 days and thus considered adequate. 
Pharmacokinetic results 
A similar PK profile was observed for PF-06881894, pegfilgrastim-US, and pegfilgrastim-EU. The mean 
t½ ranged from 49.4 hours to 54.7 hours for the 3 study drugs. 
The PF-US, PF-EU, and US-EU geometric mean ratios for AUC0-inf, AUC0-t and Cmax ranged from 0.95 
to 0.99. The 90% CIs for AUC0-inf, AUC 0-t and Cmax were completely contained within the predefined 
limit  of  80%  to  125%  for  all  study  drug  comparisons  (PF-US,  PF-EU,  and  US-EU).  These  results 
demonstrate PK equivalence of all study drug comparisons.

Impact of ADA’s on PK 
The incidence of subjects with anti-pegfilgrastim antibodies was substantially lower than subjects with 
anti-PEG antibodies. Ten subjects (6.5%) confirmed positive for anti-pegfilgrastim antibody at least once 
during the study (none at baseline), whereas a total of 111 subjects (72.5%) were positive for anti-PEG 
antibody at least once during the study (see Immunogenicity). 
The results of the sensitivity analysis that included the PK population plus the 10 subjects with 
confirmed positive anti-pegfilgrastim antibodies at any visit, were consistent with the results observed 
in the PK Population. The 90% CIs for AUC0-inf, AUC0-t, and Cmax parameters were completely 
contained within the predefined limit of 80% to 125% for all study drug comparisons (PF-US, PF-EU, 
and US-EU).

The 90% CI  for AUC(0-inf) and Cmax for anti-PEG  negative subjects and subjects that,  at least once 
during the study, were positive for anti-PEG antibodies were also contained within the standard 80% to 
125% range for all study drug comparisons (PF-US, PF-EU, and US-EU).

a Ratio is back-transformed in order to be expressed on the original scale of the measurement  
AUC  and  Cmax  values  were,  however,  generally  lower  in  the  presence  of  ADAs  (anti-PEG  and  anti-
Pegfilgrastim). Since the scale of difference in PK values was comparable for Neulasta and PF-06881894 
treated subjects, at least for anti-PEG, the decreased pegfilgrastim concentrations are not considered to 
be an issue in the context of a biosimilar application. For anti-pegfilgrastim antibodies, it is agreed with 
the  applicant  that  the  substantial  difference  in  the  size  of  the  ADA  positive  (n=10)  and  negative 
population makes it difficult to determine if the observations represent a real difference.

Table 10: Summary of PK Parameters - Subjects with Positive Anti-PEG Antibodies (above) 
and Negative Anti-PEG Antibodies (below) 
Two of the 10 anti-pegfilgrastim antibody positive subjects (subjects 0301128 and 0301164) had a single 
sample positive for NAb that occurred on P1 Day 13. The PK profile of subject 0301128 suggests that 
NAb may reduce the PK response. However, the effect of NAb is less clear for subject 0301164. Although 
a lower PK response was observed for this subject in period 2, the values for AUC and Cmax were still 
contained in the range of values (min-max) obtained for the PK population.

(right) 
Based on the submitted study ZIN-130-1505 (C1221001) it can be concluded that PF-06881894 have 
similar PK profiles with Neulasta EU and Neulasta US administered at a dose of 6 mg.

The applicant also submitted report of Study C1221002 (ZIN-130-1504). This was A Phase 1-2 Ascending 
Dose Study to Assess the Pharmacodynamics, Pharmacokinetics, and Safety of PF-06881894 in Subjects 
With  Non-Metastatic  Breast  Cancer  Following  Single-Dose  and  Multiple-Dose  Administration  by 
Subcutaneous Injection.  
The study was not an integral part of biosimilar program and is not described in detail in this part of the 
assessment report.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
PD equivalence between PF-06881894 and Neulasta was the primary objective in the PK/PD study ZIN-
130-1505. In this open-label, randomised, single-dose, 3-treatment, 3-period, 6-sequence, crossover 
study, ANC was assessed as a PD endpoint for similarity assessment between PF-06881894, 
pegfilgrastim-US and pegfilgrastim-EU administered as a single SC dose. ANC is a direct assessment of 
G-CSF response as it reflects the change in the number of PBPCs mobilization, drives diagnosis (e.g., 
grade of neutropenia), predicts prognosis (duration of severe neutropenia), and is utilised to monitor 
G-CSF treatment effects. Hence, ANC parameters (AUC, Cmax) in healthy volunteers can be used as a 
sensitive surrogate for clinical efficacy in terms of duration of severe neutropenia after chemotherapy. 
Further supportive data were obtained in immunogenicity study C1221005, in which assessment of 
ANC was included as a safety laboratory parameter. 
PK/PD Study ZIN-130-1505 
Study design and data analysis 
Blood  samples  (4.0  mL)  for  ANC  were  collected  by  either  IV  catheter  or  venipuncture  into  evacuated 
collection tubes within 1 hour prior to dose and at 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, 192, 216, 240, 
264,  and  288  hours  postdose.  The  selected  primary  PD  endpoints  in  study  ZIN-130-1505  were  area 
under  the  effect  versus  time  curve  for  absolute  neutrophil  count  (ANC)  from  the  time  of  dose 
administration to 288 hours after dose administration (AUECANC) and the maximum observed value for 
ANC  (ANC_Cmax).  The  secondary  PD  endpoint  was  time  of  maximum  value  for  ANC  (ANC_Tmax). 
Supplemental analyses were performed post hoc for the additional PD endpoint, area under the effect 
curve for ANC from time zero to infinity (AUECANC0-Inf).  
PD  equivalence  was  assessed  by  constructing  the  90%  confidence  intervals  (CIs)  for  the  GMR 
(test/reference)  for  AUECANC  and  ANC_Cmax.  PD  equivalence  was  concluded  if  the  90%  CIs  for  both 
AUECANC  and  ANC_Cmax  were  completely  contained  within  the  acceptance  limits  of  80%-125%.  The 
analysis population used  to determine PD equivalence (PD population) were subjects who received at 
least  1  treatment  and  had  sufficient  data  to  calculate  the  primary  PD  endpoints.  Subjects  confirmed 
positive for anti-pegfilgrastim antibodies at any time were not included in the PD Population. 
Results 
Similar  ANC  time  curves  were  observed  for  PF-06881894,  pegfilgrastim-US,  and  pegfilgrastim-EU. 
Comparable increases in mean ANC were observed after administration of PF-06881894, pegfilgrastim-
EU  and  pegfilgrastim-US,  with  peak  levels  reached  at  around  3  days  post-dose,  which  decreased 
thereafter. GMRs for the different parameters were close to 100% for all study drug comparisons (range 
0.96 to 1.02 for primary endpoints AUECANC and ANC_Cmax), as well as their corresponding 95% CI (range 
0.94 to 1.05), indicating no difference with regard to ANC response after administration of PF-06881894, 
pegfilgrastim-EU  and  pegfilgrastim-US.  When  applying  tighter  acceptance  limits  (90.0-111.0%), 
comparability between all study drugs with regards to PD was shown as well, underlining the high degree 
of similarity between PF-06881894, pegfilgrastim-EU and pegfilgrastim-US. Also, the post hoc analyses 
for  the  additional  PD  parameter  ANECANC0-Inf  demonstrated  95%  CIs  of  the  GMRs  for  all  study  drug

comparisons that were fully contained within the acceptance interval of 90.0% to 111.0%, confirming 
the PD comparability of PF-06881894, pegfilgrastim-EU and pegfilgrastim-US. 
Overall, the primary objective of this study was met and PD comparability between PF-06881894 and 
pegfilgrastim-EU, between PF-06881894 and pegfilgrastim-US, as well as between pegfilgrastim-EU and 
pegfilgrastim-US was shown. 
PF 06881894 is also referred to as HSP-130, pegfilgrastim-US referred to as US-approved Neulasta, and 
pegfilgrastim-EU referred to as EU-approved Neulasta.

Impact of ADA’s on PD 
Detailed analysis was provided by the applicant with regards to the impact of ADAs on PD parameters of 
pegfilgrastim. 
With  regards  to  the  presence  of  anti-PEG  antibodies,  a  total  of  111  subjects  (72.5%)  of  all  subjects 
enrolled  in  the  study  (n  =  153)  were  positive  for  anti-PEG  antibody  at  least  once  during  the  study, 
occurring in  similar proportions for each study drug: 36 subjects (24.3%) receiving  PF-06881894, 39 
subjects (26.7%) receiving pegfilgrastim-US, and 36 subjects (24.3%) receiving pegfilgrastim-EU. The 
first  occurrence  of  anti-PEG  antibody  across  all  treatments  occurred  in  Period  1  Day  1  (pre-existing), 
Period 1 Day 13, or Period 1 follow-up on Day 30, with exception of 1 subject that was first positive in 
Period  3  Day  1  prior  to  dosing  with  study  drug.Similar  mean  values  of  the  PD  parameters  could  be 
observed  for  all  study  drugs  compared  to  subjects  negative  for  anti-PEG  antibodies.  The  subgroup 
analyses performed by the applicant showed that the GMRs for the different PD parameters were close 
to 100% for  all study drug comparisons in both the anti-PEG positive and anti-PEG negative subjects 
(range 0.96 to 1.04), as well as their corresponding 95% CI (range 0.91 to 1.10), indicating equivalence 
with regard to ANC response after administration of PF-06881894, pegfilgrastim-EU and pegfilgrastim-
US.  When  applying  the  tighter  acceptance  limits  (90.0-111.0%),  the  95%  CIs  for  the  primary  PD 
parameters  AUECANC  and  ANC_Cmax  were  completely  contained  within  these  acceptance  limits  for  all 
study drug comparisons, underlining the high degree of similarity between PF-06881894, pegfilgrastim-
EU and pegfilgrastim-US, independently of the presence of anti-PEG antibodies.

Transform: AUECANC and ANC_Cmax - Subjects with Positive Anti-PEG Antibodies (above) and 
Negative Anti-PEG Antibodies (below) - PD Population - Study ZIN-130-1505 
With regards to the presence of anti-pegfilgrastim antibodies, a total of 10 subjects (6.5%) of all subjects 
enrolled in the study (n = 153) confirmed positive for anti-pegfilgrastim antibodies at least once during 
the study: 6 subjects (4.1%) who received PF-06881894, 2 subjects (1.4%) who received pegfilgrastim-
US reference product, and 2 subjects (1.4%) who received pegfilgrastim-EU reference product. The anti-
pegfilgrastim  antibody  response  was  specific  for  the  filgrastim  protein  moiety  for  7  out  of  these  10 
subjects.  Slightly  lower  mean  values  were  reported  for  AUECANC  for  study  drugs  PF-06881894  and 
pegfilgrastim-US, while no impact on AUECANC could be observed for pegfilgrastim-EU. However, due to 
the small number of subjects confirmed positive for anti-pegfilgrastim antibodies (n = 10) compared to 
the PD-population, it is agreed with the applicant that it is difficult to determine if this represents a real 
difference.  Subgroup  analyses  on  subjects  confirmed  positive  for  anti-pegfilgrastim  antibodies  is 
therefore  considered  not  reliable.  Sensitivity  analyses  that  included  the  PD  population  plus  the  10 
subjects with confirmed positive anti-pegfilgrastim antibodies showed consistent results with the primary 
analyses on the PD population, which could be expected as only 10 subjects confirmed positive for anti-
pegfilgrastim. 
Two  of  the  10  anti-pegfilgrastim  antibody  positive  subjects  had  a  single  sample  positive  for  NAb  that 
occurred on P1 Day 13. Both subjects received PF-06881894 in treatment period 1. The PD profile of the 
first  case  suggests  that  NAbNAb  may  affect  the  PD  response  (in  period  2,  ANC_Cmax  and  AUECANC0-inf 
values were below minimum values in the PD population). For the second subject the effect of NAb is

less  clear.  Although  a  lower  PD  response  was  observed  for  this  subject  in  period  2,  the  values  for 
AUECANC0-inf  and  Cmax  were  still  contained  in  the  range  of  values  (min-max)  obtained  for  the  PD 
population. These findings are consistent with the findings regarding the impact of NAb on PK.

Table 13. PD parameters 
Immunogenicity study C1221005 
Although the immunogenicity study C1221005 did not include formal PD assessment, assessment of ANC 
was  included  as  a  safety  laboratory  parameter.  The  mean  ANC  time  curves  appeared  similar  for  PF-
06881894 and pegfilgrastim-US. Comparable increases in mean ANC were observed after administration 
of PF-06881894 and pegfilgrastim-US, with peak levels reached at around 3 days post-dose, consistent 
with the mode of action of pegfilgrastim. These data support the findings with regards to PD-equivalence 
between PF-06881894 and pegfilgrastim-US in study ZIN-130-1505.  
This study also showed similar trends in ANC time curves between both study drugs for subjects with 
treatment-emergent  positive  anti-pegfilgrastim  antibody  results,  as  well  as  for  subjects  with  positive 
anti-pegfilgrastim  antibody  results  at  any  visit  including  baseline,  indicating  no  effect  on  ANC  by  the 
presence of anti-pegfilgrastim antibody for both study drugs. 
In this study, there was no evidence of NAb for any subject with a negative baseline anti-pegfilgrastim 
antibody result in either treatment group. However, one subject in the PF-06881894 group with positive 
baseline anti-pegfilgrastim antibody result was found to be NAb positive at 2 post-dose visits in treatment

Period 1 (Day 13 and Day 30). Although in treatment period 1 a similar ANC time profile was observed 
for this subject compared to the overall population, a clearly different profile was reported for treatment 
Period 2, with a normal ANC level on Period 2 Day 3 (4000/µL; reference range: 1700-7900/µL), which 
is decreasing compared to the ANC level on Period 2 Day 1 (pre-dose; 4400/µL). This observation is not 
consistent with the peak levels of ANC observed in the overall population at Period 2 Day 3. Moreover, 
this subject is the only subject in this study without an ANC result above the upper limit of the reference 
range (> 7900/µl) on the Period 2 Day 3 visit. As a result, it seems that for this subject ANC is affected 
by the presence of NAb. Therefore, based on this study, it cannot be excluded that the presence of NAb 
has a negative impact on PD.

2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Nyvepria, a biosimilar to Neulasta, is a pegylated G-CSF. The mechanism of action of G-CSF through the 
G-CSF receptor works by regulating the production of neutrophils within the bone marrow and effecting 
neutrophil progenitor proliferation‚ differentiation, and selected end-cell functions (including enhanced 
phagocytic  ability‚  priming  of  the  cellular  metabolism  associated  with  respiratory  burst‚  antibody-
dependent  killing,  and  the  increased  expression  of  some  cell  surface  antigens).  Pegylation  serves  to 
prolong the circulating half-life of biologic agents. 
The clinical pharmacology of PF-06881894 was characterised based on the 3-treatment comparative PD 
and  PK  study  ZIN-130-1505  PD/PK  in  healthy  subjects.  Further  supportive  data  were  obtained  in 
immunogenicity study C1221005. 
In  general,  the  applicant’s  approach  to  demonstrate  PK  and  PD  similarity  between  PF-06881894  and 
Neulasta in a single PK/PD study (ZIN-130-1505) is considered adequate and is in line with the applicable 
EMA guidelines and the EMA scientific advice (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/720012/2017): 
-  Only healthy volunteers were included in the study which is agreed as a sensitive population to 
detect potential differences in PK and PD. 
-  Subjects were injected SC with the therapeutic dose of 6mg pegfilgrastim. This is in line with the 
draft guideline on similar biological products containing rG-CSF (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/31329/2005 
Rev 1), which states that a single dose in the range of 2 to 6 mg is considered suitable to detect 
potentially relevant differences in both PK and PD. 
- 
- 
Taken into account the high inter-subject variability, a cross-over design was chosen to evaluate 
PK and PD comparability. 
Treatments were separated by a wash-out period of minimum 51 days. This is considered long 
enough to avoid carry-over of pharmacological effects.

Pharmacokinetics 
Pegfilgrastim  concentrations  in  serum  were  determined  using  an  electrochemiluminescence  (ECL) 
immunoassay.  It  was  shown  that  the  presence  of  anti-pegfilgrastim  antibodies  interferes  with  the 
measurement of pegfilgrastim.  
PK equivalence was assessed by constructing the 90% CIs for the GMR (test/reference) for the primary 
PK variables AUC0-inf and Cmax. Although AUC0-t was defined as a secondary PK variable, contrary to 
what’s  stated  in  the  draft  guideline,  the  same  statistical  analyses  were  performed  for  this  parameter 
post-hoc. Therefore, this is not considered to be an issue. 
PK  equivalence  was  demonstrated  for  all  study  drug  comparisons  (PF-US,  PF-EU,  and  US-EU).  The 
geometric mean ratios for AUC0-inf, AUC0-t and Cmax ranged from 0.95 to 0.99 and the corresponding 
90% CIs were completely contained within the predefined limit of 80% to 125%. 
PK  equivalence  was  also  shown  for  the  PK  population  plus  subjects  confirmed  positive  for  anti-
pegfilgrastim antibodies and for anti-PEG positive and anti-PEG negative subjects, suggesting that ADAs 
do not impact PK similarity.  
AUC and Cmax values were generally lower in the presence of ADAs (anti-PEG and anti-Pegfilgrastim). 
Since  the  scale  of  difference  in  PK  values  was  comparable  for  Neulasta  and  PF-06881894  treated 
subjects, at least for anti-PEG, these decreased pegfilgrastim concentrations are not considered to be an 
issue. For anti-pegfilgrastim antibodies, it is agreed with the applicant that the substantial difference in 
the size of the ADA positive and negative population makes it difficult to determine if the observations 
represent a real difference. 
Two subjects tested positive for NAb and at least for one of them, the PK response (AUC and Cmax) was 
reduced. However, based on these data in a very low number of subjects in whom NAb could be observed, 
this is considered a chance finding and the presence of NAb did not appear to result in reduced clinical 
response or increased risk for injection site reactions. 
Pharmacodynamics 
The dose administered is considered adequate to establish PD similarity and is appropriate from a safety 
point of view. The sampling schedule seems adequate to reliably estimate the PD parameters. 
ANC was determined at Australian Clinical Labs using haematology analyser. The validity of ANC results 
was approved by the measurement of quality control samples and by the participation in external quality 
control schemes. 
The selection of the primary parameter, ANC as relevant pharmacodynamic marker for the activity of 
pegfilgrastim,  is  in  line  with  the  Guidance  on  similar  medicinal  products  containing  r-GCSF 
(EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/31329/2005). The primary PD endpoints AUECANC and ANC_Cmax are acceptable. 
The  applicant’s  justification  for  not  reporting  AUEC0-t  and  Emax  of  CD34+  as  secondary  PD  endpoints 
(stem cell mobilisation is not an approved indication of the reference product and neither is it sought in 
the present marketing application, the longer washout period (8 weeks) than required gives less risk of 
carryover  effect,  etc.)  is  acknowledged.  It  is  agreed  that  inclusion  of  those  endpoints  would  have 
provided only supportive additional data and provided that a high biosimilarity level in quality level, PK 
level and in ANC results is demonstrated, there would be no evident reason to expect another effect on 
the stem cell mobilisation. 
The  open-label  design  of  study  ZIN-130-1505  could  potentially  contribute  to  higher  ANC  levels,  as  it 
could  lead  to  more  stressed  subjects  when  treated  with  PF-06881894  (e.g.  due  to  possible  fear  of 
receiving  a  new  product  and  not  an  established  one).  However,  the  high  degree  of  PD  similarity 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/603684/2020  
Page 55/82 
 
 
 
demonstrated between PF-06881894 and Neulasta does not suggest any impact of the open-label design 
on PD similarity. 
No  sound  justification  for  the  comparability  range  of  80%-125%  and  explanation  for  conducting 
supplemental  PD  analysis  were  found.  However,  95%  CIs  (as  requested  in  the  draft  GL  on  similar 
biological medicinal products containing r-GCSF, EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/31329/2005 Rev 1) for primary PD 
endpoints AUECANC and ANC_Cmax, calculated in the supplemental analysis, were contained within the 
equivalence limit of 90% to 111%, which is in line with the draft GL (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/31329/2005 
Rev 1). As such, study ZIN-130-1505 demonstrated PD equivalence between PF-06881894 and Neulasta 
and  provided  a  PK/PD  biosimilarity  bridge  between  EU-sourced  and  US-sourced  Neulasta.  The  high 
degree  of  PD  similarity  was  further  supported  by  ANC  data  from  immunogenicity  study  C1221005, 
reporting similar mean ANC time curves for both study drugs PF-06881894 and US-sourced Neulasta.

of Pharmacodynamic Parameters, Natural Log Transform: AUECANC, ANC_Cmax and AUECANC0-inf 
– Pharmacodynamic Population – Study ZIN-130-1505 
Regarding the impact of ADAs on PD similarity, both study designs of study ZIN-130-1505 and C1221005 
are considered not optimal. The crossover study design of ZIN-130-1505 is not suitable for comparing 
the  immunogenicity  of  3  treatments,  therefore  only  exploratory  immunogenicity  assessment  was 
conducted. For study C1221005, PD assessment was not a study objective, however ANC was evaluated 
as  safety  laboratory  parameter.  Although  study  designs  were  not  optimal,  the  presence  of  anti-PEG 
antibodies or anti-pegfilgrastim antibody had no overall effect on PD or PK similarity.  
In both studies, 3 subjects were found to have samples positive for neutralising antibodies (one case in 
C1221005 study, and two cases in ZIN-130-1505 study) while being treated with PF-06881894, while 
none of the subjects receiving pegfilgrastim-US or pegfilgrastim-EU had NAb positive samples. For 2 out 
of 3 subjects confirmed positive for NAb while being treated with PF-06881894, a significant abnormal 
PD profile was observed in the treatment period subsequent to the treatment period in which NAb were 
measured, which in one subject was confirmed by an abnormal PK profile (PK not measured in the other 
subject).  However,  the  PD  or  PK  profile  were  normal  during  the  treatment  period  in  which  NAb  were

EMA/CHMP/603684/2020  
Page 56/82 
 
 
 
 
observed, whereas during the treatment period where the PD or PK profile was abnormal, no NAb could 
be observed or NAb were not measured. With regards to the effect of NAb on safety, only for 1 of the 3 
subjects a potential correlation with a TEAE of injection site rash was observed. In conclusion, based on 
data  in  a  very  low  number  of  patients  in  whom  NAb  could  be  observed,  the  presence  of  NAb  did  not 
appear to result in reduced clinical response or increased risk for injection site reactions. 
The study ZIN-130-1504 PD/PK, an ascending single-and multiple-dose, open-label, non-comparative, 
parallel-group PD/PK study in women with non-distantly metastatic breast cancer, is considered 
supportive. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Based on the submitted data, PK/PD equivalence of PF-06881894 to the Neulasta Reference Products 
(pegfilgrastim-US and pegfilgrastim-EU) has been demonstrated. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
No  dedicated  efficacy  studies  were  performed  in  patients.  PD  biosimilarity  testing  for  a  biosimilar 
candidate to a pegfilgrastim is a supported strategy in the draft guideline EMEA/CHMP/31329/2005 in 
Rev  1.,  which  states  that  “pivotal  evidence  for  similar  efficacy  will  be  derived  from  the  similarity 
demonstrated in physicochemical, functional, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic comparisons” and 
that “a dedicated comparative efficacy trial is therefore not considered necessary”. 
The applicant’s approach to demonstrate only PD biosimilarity in healthy donors instead of a full clinical 
efficacy biosimilarity study is therefore supported. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
The safety (including immunogenicity) data were assessed in the 2 comparative clinical studies in healthy 
volunteers (ZIN-130-1505 and C1221005) to ensure that there are no clinically meaningful differences 
between  PF-06881894  and  Neulasta.  Additionally,  safety  data  from  the  non-comparative  study  in 
patients with non-distantly metastatic breast cancer (ZIN-130-1504) is presented. 
Patient exposure 
A total of 358 subjects were exposed to at least 1 dose of PF-06881984 (148 subjects in Study ZIN-
130 1505 and 210 subjects in Study C1221005); 356 subjects received at least 1 dose of 
pegfilgrastim-US (146 subjects in Study ZIN-130-1505 and 210 subjects in Study C1221005). 
Study ZIN-130-1505 
A total of 153 subjects were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to 1 of all 6 sequence groups 
to receive each of the 3 study drugs (A: PF-06881894; B: pegfilgrastim-US; C: pegfilgrastim-EU) over 
3 treatment periods for a total study duration of approximately 143 days. Overall, 148 subjects were 
administered PF-06881894, 146 subjects were administered pegfilgrastim-US and 148 subjects were 
administered pegfilgrastim-EU.  
A total of 142 subjects (92.8%) completed the study and 11 subjects (7.2%) were prematurely 
discontinued from the study.  
This study was conducted in Australia. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/603684/2020

Study C1221005 
A total of 422 subjects were randomised into the study, out of which 210 subjects were administered 
PF-06881894 and 210 subjects were administered pegfilgrastim-US. Two subjects from the PF-
06881894 group were randomised but did not receive any study drug.  
Therefore, a total of 420 subjects were treated. The duration of Treatment Period 1 was 30 (± 2) days 
and the duration of Treatment Period 2 was 60 (± 5) days, with a total of 2 doses of either PF-
06881894 or the pegfilgrastim-US during the study duration. 
A total of 376 subjects (89.1%) completed the study and 46 subjects (10.9%) were prematurely 
discontinued from the study. 
This study was conducted in the US. 
Overall, in ZIN-130-1505 and C1221005 clinical studies, no major difference is observed in the 
disposition of the subjects depending of the treatment. 
Healthy male or female subjects were enrolled into the studies. Regarding the demographic and 
baseline characteristics of enrolled population, the mean age, ethnicity, or mean BMI were overall 
comparable between the treatment groups in both studies. In ZIN-130-1505, only the sex ratio can be 
slightly different depending of the sequence. And, in C1221005, it can be noted that they were 15 
more female subjects treated in the PF-06881984 arm compare to pegfilgrastim-US arm.  
Adverse events 
The applicant provided data related to adverse events (AEs) based on the 2 main clinical studies in 
which the safety was settled as a secondary objective. A description of analysis of AEs, manner of 
summarization of AEs, definition of AEs and other relevant specifications were outlined accordingly.

Study ZIN-130-1505 
There were 485 treatment-related TEAEs reported in 143 subjects (96.6%) who received PF-
06881894. In comparison to the pegfilgrastim-US group (n = 461 treatment-related TEAEs in 134 
subjects; 91.8%) and pefilgrastim-EU group (n = 460 treatment-related TEAEs in 138 subjects; 
93.2%), the percentage for PF-06881894 was of 4.8% and 3.4% higher, respectively. In view of the 
reported treatment related TEAEs in study C1221005 higher in PF-06881894 compared to 
pegfilgrastim-US group (please see below), these minor numerical differences are considered as not 
clinically meaningful. 
The SOCs for the most commonly reported all-causality TEAEs (in >50% of subjects) across the 3 
study drug groups were Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders, Nervous System Disorders, 
General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions, and Gastrointestinal Disorders (Table 16; 
source: table 15 CSR ZIN-130-1505). The most frequently reported treatment-related TEAEs (in ≥50% 
of subjects) were musculoskeletal pain and headache which corresponds to the known safety profile of 
Neulasta as a reference medicinal product. Also reported in ≥25% of subjects were nausea and 
injection site pain (all-causality). 
Overall, there were 4 TEAEs considered severe which were reported in 3 subjects (2 subjects who 
received PF-06881894 and 1 subject who received pegfilgrastim-EU).  
Further, 2 subjects discontinued the study due to TEAEs (1 who received PF-06881894 and 1 subject 
who received pegfilgrastim-US).  
Study C1221005 
Overall, in 194 subjects (92.4%) in the PF-06881894 group (616 TEAEs) and 202 subjects (96.2%) in 
pegfilgrastim-US group (567 TEAEs) at least one TEAE was reported. A total of 1,012 TEAEs reported 
in 389 subjects were considered treatment-related (91% of subjects in the PF-06881894 group and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/603684/2020

94,3% of subjects in the pegfilgrastim-US group). The most commonly reported adverse events were 
assigned to the SOC Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders and SOC Nervous System 
Disorders (Table 16). The most frequently reported treatment-related adverse events per both groups 
(PF-06881894 and pegfilgrastim-US) were back pain, headache and musculoskeletal pain.  
In this study, an imbalance in the direction of higher incidence per PF-06881894 group could be found 
for the TEAEs of all causalities assigned to the SOC Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. In 
case of the PF-06881894 group, in 34 subjects (16.2%) any TEAE under this SOC was reported in 
contrast to the pegfilgrastim-US group which included only 14 subjects (6.7%) relevant for this 
condition. Even though the respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders, such as acute respiratory 
distress syndrome, pulmonary adverse reactions (interstitial pneumonia, pulmonary oedema, 
pulmonary infiltrates and pulmonary fibrosis), haemoptysis and pulmonary haemorrhage, are 
summarised in the list of adverse reactions in the section 4.8 of SmPC for Neulasta, ordered under 
frequency “uncommon” and in case of pulmonary haemorrhage under frequency “rare”, the observed 
counts of related TEAEs in the PF-06881894 group seem to be significantly higher. The applicant was 
therefore requested to provide a thorough discussion on the identified difference.  
The most frequently reported PTs for this SOC were PT Oropharyngeal pain (6 cases of treatment-
related AEs in the PF-06881894 group) and PT Dyspnoea (6 cases of treatment-related AEs in the PF-
06881894 group). Most of the cases of oropharyngeal pain were mild in severity (5 of 6 cases). In the 
remaining one case, the severity was assessed as moderate. All the events resolved without treatment 
except in one subject that was treated with ibuprofen. In general, the events of oropharyngeal pain do 
not suggest a pulmonary disorder as a cause for these events. The observed cases were accompanied 
by other confounding factors such as headache or other types of musculoskeletal pain. The appropriate 
justification including the causality assessment was provided.  
In terms of PT Dyspnoea, 6 events of dyspnoea (in 6 subjects) for PF-06881894 and no events (in 
0 subjects) for US-Neulasta assessed as treatment-related were reported. All these events resolved 
without treatment and were considered mild. The review of these cases was provided by applicant 
accordingly. No significant issue was identified. 
Pooled data from Studies ZIN-130-1505 and C1221005 
A total of 1,271 TEAEs were reported in 341 subjects (95.3%) in the PF-06881894 group and 1,167 
TEAEs were reported in 341 subjects (95.8%) in the pegfilgrastim-US group. 
Based on the overall summary of pooled data the AEs seems to be consistent with the known safety 
profile of reference medicinal product. 
There was one additional study, i.e. open-label, non-comparative study Phase I-II ascending single- 
and multiple- dose Study ZIN-130-1504. In this study a total of 25 subjects were exposed to at least 1 
dose of PF-06881894. This study included female subjects with non-distantly metastatic cancer with a 
mean age of 59.3 years. This study was conducted in the EU. Presented adverse events were 
consistent with the known safety profile of Neulasta. No deaths were reported and no subjects were 
discontinued from the study due to adverse events. 
Adverse events of special interest 
Clinically important adverse events of special interest were pre-specified in the study protocols based 
on the safety profile of the reference product. Additional adverse events of interest, including 
musculoskeletal disorders and injection site reactions, as recommended by FDA, were evaluated 
separately. 
In study ZIN-130-1505, a total of 33 treatment-emergent AESIs were reported in 26 subjects 
(17.0%), with comparable distribution among the 3 study drugs. All AESIs were mild (30 AESIs) or 
Assessment report

Page 60/82 
 
 
 
moderate (3 AESIs) in severity. AESIs were only reported under the categories of potential allergic 
reactions and splenomegaly in this study. Of the 33 treatment emergent AESIs, 18 were reported as 
related to the study drug (3 events in subjects who received PF-06881894, 9 events in subjects who 
received pegfilgrastim-US, and 6 events in subjects who received pegfilgrastim-EU). 
In study C1221005, 11 subjects (5.2%) in the PF-06881894 group and 9 subjects (4.3%) in the 
pegfilgrastim-US group experienced at least 1 treatment emergent AESI in the study. AESIs were only 
reported under the categories of potential allergic reactions and thrombocytopenia in this study. The 
12 events under the AESI of potential allergic reaction were mild or moderate in severity and the 10 
events under the AESI of thrombocytopenia were all mild in severity. The majority of these AESIs (14 
of 21 events) were considered related to the study drug by the investigator.  
In the pooled data from Studies ZIN-130-1505 and C1221005, there were no cases reported for the 
following categories of AEs: splenic rupture, acute respiratory distress syndrome, alveolar 
haemorrhage, haemoptysis, leukocystosis, capillary leak syndrome, cytokine release syndrome, 
cutaneous vasculitis and glomerulonephritis. 
In a category of potential allergic reactions, overall, 40 adverse events were reported of which most 
them were assigned to the PT Injection site rash per both studies. The percentage of treatment 
emergent adverse events of special interest of potential allergic reactions was comparable between PF-
016881894 and pegfilgrastim-US groups. 
However, in the Study C1221005 the incidence of TEAEs of all causalities assigned to the SOC General 
disorders and administration site conditions observed for PF-06881894 (44; 21.0%) was higher in 
contrast to pegfilgrastim-US (34; 16.2%). Based on the tabulated summary of the treatment-related 
TEAEs the difference of 5.3% per this SOC is present, concretely 20.5% and 15.2%, respectively. The 
applicant was asked to provide a detailed analysis on the identified differences with inclusion of 
relevant subject related circumstances (i.e. causality assessment in regard of the underlying conditions 
and confounding factors) and in regard of the relevant PTs reported. The most frequently reported PTs 
from this SOC were PT Non-cardiac chest pain, PT Injection site pain and PT Fatigue. The appropriate 
comparison of these results to the known safety profile of reference medicinal product was provided. 
Of note, none of the treatment-related AEs assigned to this SOC were assessed as serious. There was 
1 event of fatigue and influenza like illness in the PF-06881894 group which was considered moderate 
in severity, plus 1 event of non-cardiac chest pain in the US-Neulasta group which was considered 
moderate in severity, too. All the remaining events were of mild severity. In the Study ZIN-130-1505, 
no similar difference between the PF-06881894 group and Neulasta group in terms of both number of 
subjects and number of events for this SOC was observed. Based on the reassessment of respective 
data, it was agreed that the existing differences between the treatment groups in the Study C1221005 
do not indicate any significant safety findings. Due to all the circumstances surrounding the observed 
cases such as concurrently reported treatment-related adverse events, the known safety profile of 
Neulasta (i.e. frequency of relevant ADRs listed in the EU SmPC) or presence of other underlying 
conditions, the submitted response is considered fully accepted and no further action is warranted. 
Two cases of splenomegaly were reported only in the Study ZIN-130-1505, i.e. one each in study 
group (PF-06881894 and pegfilgrastim-US). Both cases required no intervention and both subjects 
completed the study. 
Overall, 9 subjects reported thrombocytopenia. All of them were enrolled in the Study C1221005 and 
these events were reported in both PF-06881894 and pegfilgrastim-US groups. No statistically 
significant differences between study groups were observed. 
Musculoskeletal pain was the most common event reported under SOC Musculoskeletal and Connective 
Tissue Disorders, no significant differences in Musculoskeletal disorders were reported between the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/603684/2020  
Page 61/82 
 
 
 
treatment groups. No significant differences in Injection site reactions were identified between the 
treatment groups. 
The AESI incidence profiles were overall balanced between the study drug groups in the 2 comparative 
clinical studies, without any clinically meaningful difference identified, and no new significant safety 
information to the known safety profile of pegfilgrastim in the context of adverse events of special 
interest could be identified.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
The data reflecting serious adverse events (SAEs) and deaths were provided in a structured form with 
the inclusion of case narratives describing basic characteristic of the events, such as PT and SOC 
MedDRA term of the reaction observed, start date/end date of AE, severity, outcome, relationship to 
study treatment/chemotherapy and actions taken with study treatment. 
In both comparative clinical studies, there were very few SAEs, and none of them was assessed as 
related to study drug. 
Of note, no deaths were reported in the concerned clinical studies. 
Study ZIN-130-1505 
Overall, there were 4 TEAEs considered severe which were reported in 3 subjects (2 subjects who 
received PF-06881894, i.e. 1.4%, and 1 subject who received pegfilgrastim-EU, i.e. 0.7%). One event 
of arthralgia (left hip pain) was considered possibly related to PF-06881894 and the events of skin 
abrasion and laceration were reported in one subject and considered unrelated to PF-06881894. One 
event of renal colic was considered unrelated to pegfilgrastim-EU. Arthralgia as a type of 
musculoskeletal pain is listed in the tabulated summary of adverse reactions in the section 4.8 of 
SmPC for reference medicinal product.  
Based on the analysis of serious adverse events which occurred in this study, 3 treatment-emergent 
SAEs were reported in 3 subjects. Each subject was enrolled in another study group. Of them, 2 
subjects experienced a spontaneous abortion (1 subject from PF-06881894 group and 1 subject from 
pegfilgrastim-US) and in 1 subject from pegfilgrastim-EU a renal colic occurred. All the treatment-
emergent SAEs were assessed as unrelated to treatment.  
In regard of the cases of spontaneous abortion, as defined per protocol, all subjects had to use an 
adequate method of contraception to prevent pregnancy throughout the course of the study. In the 
section 4.6 of SmPC, the information related to pregnancy indicates that pegfilgrastim is not 
recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception.  
Study C1221005 
A total of 5 SAEs were reported in 4 subjects (urinary tract infection, multiple injuries, 2 events of 
spontaneous abortion and physical assault).  
One subject from the PF-06881894 group had to discontinue due to urinary tract infection. This event 
was reported as SAE, moderate in severity and was considered not related to the study drug by 
investigator. 
Further, 3 subjects were from the pegfilgrastim-US group. In 1 of them, a spontaneous abortion was 
reported. This subject completed study. In this case, a relation of the event of spontaneous abortion to 
study drug pegfilgrastim-US and/or concomitant drug medroxyprogesterone acetate was assessed as 
reasonably possible. Due to the relevant recommendation on pregnancy in the product information as 
reflected above this explanation is considered adequate. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/603684/2020  
Page 62/82 
 
 
 
Another female from the pegfilgrastim-US group had spontaneous abortion, too. The birth control 
method of this subject was a spermicide condom. In line with the known safety profile of Neulasta, 
there are no or limited available data regarding the use of pegfilgrastim in pregnant women. 
Pegfilgrastim is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using 
contraception.  
In 1 subject from the pegfilgrastim-US group, multiple injuries and physical assault were reported. 
These events were considered not related to study drug, which is accepted. 
The submitted data and related evaluation do not reveal any safety issues which would indicate a 
significant difference between the biosimilar and reference medicinal product. 
Laboratory findings 
The relevant listings of individual laboratory parameters and other values of vital signs, physical 
findings and other observations related together with a targeted analysis were provided accordingly. 
Per both comparative studies (Study ZIN-130-1505 and Study C1221005), in regard of the 
haematology parameters, a decrease in platelet count and decrease or increase in lymphocyte count 
following the administration of each study drug were observed.  
Regarding the clinical chemistry, according to the SmPC for Neulasta, the elevations in lactate 
dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase occurred in each study drug. The levels returned to the 
baseline by the follow-up visit. Further, ALT, ALP and creatinine increased were reported in all groups. 
These findings were fully comparable between given study groups. 
In the product information for Neulasta, glomerulonephritis is listed as an adverse reaction with a 
frequency “uncommon” and relevant warning with recommendation on urinalysis monitoring is also 
present. Glomerulonephritis is also identified as an important identified risk in the context of risk 
management planning. The urinalysis and PCR (protein-creatinine ratio) were conducted for all 
subjects as defined by protocol. No evidence of glomerulonephritis for any subject was reported.  
The laboratory findings were consistent with the known therapeutic response and the safety profile of 
Neulasta in general. No relevant difference was observed between the PF-06881894 and reference 
medicinal products. There were no unexplained or clinically meaningful unexpected mean changes from 
baseline in any laboratory parameter following study drug administration (haematology and clinical 
chemistry parameters). In line with the pharmacological effect of pegfilgrastim, increases in 
leukocytes, in particular neutrophils, were observed after administration of study drugs in both clinical 
studies. 
However, to support the biosimilarity of PF-06881894 with Neulasta, the applicant was asked to submit 
a table with the number of patients (%) with laboratory adverse events (as, for instance, 
hypoglycaemia, ALP/ALT/CRP/GGT/AST, creatinine or blood creatine phosphokinase increase…), per 
treatment groups for both clinical studies (ZIN-130-1505 and C1221005) and for the pooled data. It 
was accepted that no clinically meaningful differences were observed in the incidence of laboratory AEs 
in the different treatment groups when reviewing the data independently for Studies ZIN-130-1505 
and C1221005 or in a pooled fashion. 
Safety in special populations 
No specific safety analysis based on age, sex, height, weight or body mass were carried out. Neither 
were extrinsic factors such as medical environment, use of other drugs, use of tobacco, use of alcohol, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/603684/2020  
Page 63/82 
 
 
 
and food habits subjected to a safety analysis. The effect of these factors on the safety profile of PF-
06881894 is anticipated to be similar to that of Neulasta. 
There were 2 pregnancies (1 subject each for PF-06881894 and pegfilgrastim-US) reported in study 
ZIN-130-1505. Both subjects reported use of contraception during intercourse. 
In study C1221005, there were a total of 7 AEs of pregnancy reported in 7 subjects (2 subjects in the 
PF-06881894 group and 5 subjects in the pegfilgrastim-US group) for the study. Three subjects 
reported non-compliance with the protocol required highly-effective contraceptive method and a 
protocol deviation was documented for each subject. The other 4 subjects reported use of 
contraception during intercourse. 
Immunological events 
In this clinical biosimilar program, the immunogenicity potential and impact of PF-06881894 and 
Neulasta (sourced from the EU and the US) were assessed in healthy subjects. As the applicant listed, 
it was evaluated in clinical studies through collection of blood samples and their testing for the 
presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) and neutralizing antibodies (NAb) and by assessment of 
immune-based adverse effects, both acute and delayed. The appropriate tabulated summaries of 
immunogenicity test results were also provided. 
The steps outlined are in accordance with the standard immunogenicity testing in regard of the assays 
for comparative immunogenicity as described in the EMA document “Guideline on immunogenicity 
assessment of therapeutic proteins (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/14327/2006 Rev 1)” dated 18 May 2017. The 
immunogenicity assays included an ECL assay validated for testing of ADA against pegfilgrastim with a 
component to assess assay specificity for the filgrastim moiety, an ELISA assay validated to detect 
antibodies to the PEG moiety, a cell-based assay to determine NAb, an assay to determinate antibody 
isotype and measurement of antibody titer.  
Study C1221005 
Anti-pegfilgrastim Antibody and NAb 
Among the subjects who were negative for anti-pegfilgrastim antibody at baseline, a total of 
12 subjects in the PF-06881894 group (5.9%) and 15 subjects in the pegfilgrastim-US group (7.5%) 
were confirmed as positive for anti-pegfilgrastim antibody (i.e. had at least 1 positive antibody) post-
dose.  
According to the applicant, results from the comparative immunogenicity study C1221005 met the 
statistical criteria for non-inferiority of PF-06881894 vs pegfilgrastim-US with respect to anti-
pegfilgrastim antibody, which was the primary endpoint in this study. The 90% CI for the risk 
difference in percentage of subjects with a negative baseline anti pegfilgrastim antibody test result and 
confirmed post-dose positive anti-pegfilgrastim antibody test result at any visit during the study was (-
5.915, 2.675), with the upper bound less than the non-inferiority margin of ≤0.10 (equivalent to 10 in 
percentage). However, as discussed in the scientific advice (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/720012/2017), in the 
EU, a formal non-inferiority study is not requested for safety data. For comparative immunogenicity 
assessment, the parallel group design of study C1221005 is adequate. 
Overall, no meaningful differences were observed between the percentages of subjects with positive 
anti-pegfilgrastim antibody test in the 2 treatment groups. 
In regard of the presence of NAb, it was negative for all subjects with the negative baseline of anti-
pegfilgrastim antibodies.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/603684/2020  
Page 64/82 
 
 
 
However, 1 subject (subject 10011282) from the PF-06881894 group with a positive baseline of anti-
pegfilgrastim antibodies was found to be NAb positive at 2 postdose visits: baseline positive for anti-
pegfilgrastim antibody (titer of 80), and positive at P1D13 (titer of 40) and at P1D30 (titer of 80); anti-
pegfilgrastim antibody response were not specific for the filgrastim protein moiety; baseline negative 
for anti-PEG antibody, positive at P1D13 (titer of 12800) and negative at P1D28; 2 NAb positive 
samples at P1D13 (titer of 16) and P1D28 (titer of 8) without demonstrable clinical impact of the NAb 
in treatment period 1 (absolute neutrophil count consistent with those seen in other subjects; no 
related associated adverse events) (no PK data available). However, in the subsequent treatment 
period 2, the ANC level at Period 2 Day 3 was decreased compared to ANC level on Period 2 Day 1 
(pre-dose) and is further decreasing at Period 2 Day 5, which is not consistent with the expected PD 
profile reaching ANC peak levels at Day 3 post-dose. As no NAb assessments were planned at the 
Period 2 Day 3 and Period 2 Day 5 visits and the patient discontinued from the study after the Period 2 
Day 5 visit, no data are available regarding the presence of NAb in treatment Period 2. 
A total of 39 subjects (16 subjects in the PF-06881894 group and 23 subjects in the pegfilgrastim-US 
group) had samples that were confirmed positive for anti-pegfilgrastim antibody at baseline and/or 
postdose. In these instances, the anti-pegfilgrastim titres were generally higher with the first dose 
(majority P1D13) and waned over time in the second study period. The higher titres observed for some 
subjects (3 cases) did not have any negative impact on the ANC profile when compared to other 
subjects that were anti-pegfilgrastim antibody positive. 
Anti-PEG Antibody 
Overall, the number of subjects with anti-pegfilgrastim antibodies (16 subjects in the PF-06881894 
group and 23 subjects in the pegfilgrastim-US group) was substantially lower than the percentage of 
subjects with anti-PEG antibodies (126 subjects in the PF-06881894 group and 131 subjects in the 
pegfilgrastim-US group). No meaningful differences were observed between the 2 treatment groups in 
the percentage of subjects with confirmed positive anti-PEG antibody and in the mean of anti-PEG 
antibody titres. 
As recommended during the (Co) Rapporteur pre-submission meeting, the applicant was requested to 
clarify if the difference in distribution of anti-PEG antibody titre quartile has been studied and 
discussed. It was confirmed that this difference has been studied in this study. Overall, the distribution 
of the anti-PEG antibody titers across the visits was similar in the PF-06881894 and pegfilgrastim-US 
treatment groups (with a maximum titer reached on P1D13). 
Effect of Immunogenicity on Safety 
All of the 39 subjects who had samples that were confirmed positive for anti-pegfilgrastim antibody 
sample at any visit including baseline and/or postdose, except 1 each in the PF-06881894 group and 
pegfilgrastim-US group, experienced at least 1 TEAE during the study. Overall, no meaningful 
differences were observed between the 2 treatment groups for subjects with positive anti-pegfilgrastim 
antibody test results. Review of the TEAEs in subjects with confirmed positive anti-pegfilgrastim 
antibody at any visit including baseline revealed no effect on TEAEs by the presence of anti 
pegfilgrastim antibody. 
For 6 of the 7 subjects in the PF-06881894 group with more than 1 positive anti-pegfilgrastim antibody 
at any visit including baseline, there was no evidence of immunogenicity-associated adverse events 
due to the presence of anti-pegfilgrastim antibodies. 
For 1 subject in the PF-06881894 group (with a positive baseline of anti-pegfilgrastim antibodies who 
had 2 anti pegfilgrastim antibody samples tested positive for NAb) however, immunogenicity-
associated adverse events were reported (injection site rash -ISR- at P1D7 and injection site pain at 
P1D9; both were considered mild in severity and resolved rapidly). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/603684/2020  
Page 65/82 
 
 
 
As required, the applicant has submitted the immunogenicity results observed using the confirmatory 
CP with a false-positive rate of 1% for the studies (instead of 0.1%). For this study, although the 
number of subjects with negative baseline anti-pegfilgrastim antibody and confirmed post-dose 
positive anti-pegfilgrastim antibody at any visit increase, the number is similar between PF-06881894 
and pegfilgrastim-US.  
Among the subjects with negative anti-pegfilgrastim antibody at baseline, there were 12 subjects in 
the PF-06881894 group and 15 subjects in the pegfilgrastim-US group who had at least 1 postdose 
positive anti-pegfilgrastim antibody sample. All of these 27 subjects, except 1 in the PF-06881894 
group, experienced at least 1 TEAE during the study. No meaningful differences were observed 
between the 2 treatment groups. 
Of the 420 subjects enrolled in the study who received at least 1 dose of study drug, 11 subjects 
reported TEAEs in SMQs (narrow) Hypersensitivity, Anaphylactic Reactions, and Angioedema in study 
C1221005. Three of these 11 subjects were confirmed positive for anti-pegfilgrastim antibody at least 
once during the study including baseline: one subject in the PF-06881894 group (see before) and 2 
subjects in the pegfilgrastim-US group (who reported hypersensitivity not related to the study drug).  
Nineteen subjects reported ISRs in study C1221005. But only the subject in the PF-06881894 group 
was confirmed positive for anti-pegfilgrastim antibody at least once during the study including 
baseline.  
General review of the immunogenicity-associated TEAEs (including hypersensitivity, anaphylactic 
reactions, angioedema and injection site reactions) across the treatment groups in subjects with 
confirmed positive anti-pegfilgrastim antibody at any visit including baseline revealed no impact on 
safety by the presence of anti-pegfilgrastim antibody. No meaningful differences between the 
treatment groups was identified. 
Study ZIN-130-1505 
Since the crossover study design of ZIN-130-1505 is not suitable for comparing the immunogenicity of 
3 treatments, only exploratory immunogenicity assessment was conducted. 
Compared to the number of subjects with positive anti-pegfilgrastim antibodies (n = 10 subjects, i.e. 
6.5%), there were 111 subjects (i.e. 72.5%) positive for anti-PEG antibodies. The applicant 
summarised the data based on the first onset of positive result for each subject during study in regard 
of the concrete immunogenicity test, study drug (PF-06881894, pegfilgrastim-US and pegfilgrastim-
EU) and the respective percentage based on the number of relevant subjects which received the study 
drug in given period (visit at Day 1, Day 13 or follow-up).  
Anti-pegfilgrastim Antibody and NAb 
No subjects were anti-pegfilgrastim positive at baseline. Out of the 153 enrolled subjects, 10 subjects 
(6.5%) confirmed positive for anti-pegfilgrastim antibody results, at least once in the study: 6 subjects 
(4.1%) from the PF-06881894 group, 2 subjects (1.4%) from the pegfilgrastim-US and 2 subjects 
(1.4%) from the pegfilgrastim-EU. The anti-pegfilgrastim antibody response was specific for the 
filgrastim protein moiety for 7 subjects: 4 in PF-06881894 group, 1 in pegfilgrastim-US group, and 2 
subjects in pegfilgrastim-EU group.  
Overall, there was a slightly higher percentage of subjects with anti-pegfilgrastim positive samples for 
PF-06881894 (6 subjects in PF-06881894 group vs. 2 in pegfilgrastim-US and 2 in pegfilgrastim-EU). 
However, 5 of the 10 anti-pegfilgrastim positive subjects had only 1 positive sample during the study: 
4 subjects who received PF-06881894 and 1 subject who received pegfilgrastim-US. Each of these 
samples was low titre (<20 to 40) and there was no evidence of NAb. As suggested by the applicant, 
results could be consistent with a false positive antibody test. As required, the antibody titres, isotypes 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/603684/2020  
Page 66/82 
 
 
 
and clinical outcomes (PK/PD and safety) were also discussed for the subjects who had 1 anti-
pegfilgrastim antibody positive sample in study ZIN-130-1505 (4 subjects in PF-06881894 group and 1 
subject in pegfilgrastim-US group).  
However, the applicant has submitted the immunogenicity results observed using the confirmatory CP 
with a false-positive rate of 1% for the studies (instead of 0.1%). For this study, the numbers of 
patients with positive anti-pegfilgrastim antibody remain close to the numbers observed with the 
confirmatory CP with a false-positive rate of 0.1%.  
The percentage of subjects with anti-pegfilgrastim antibody positive samples was balanced across 
study drugs when considering only the subjects with more than 1 positive sample: 2 subjects in PF-
06881894 group (subjects 0301128 and 0301164) vs. 1 in pegfilgrastim-US and 2 in pegfilgrastim-EU. 
This slightly higher overall percentage of subjects with positive anti-pegfilgrastim antibody results for 
PF-06881894 could be considered as acceptable due to the results at final visit (i.e. follow-up visit) 
when only 2 subjects from the PF-06881894 group were positive for anti-pegfilgrastim antibody. The 
lasting of positive anti-pegfilgrastim antibody results per given study groups did not reveal any 
difference that would indicate a new trend.  
Out of the 10 anti-pegfilgrastim antibody positive subjects, none of the subjects receiving 
pegfilgrastim-US or pegfilgrastim-EU had sample positive for NAb. However, in 2 subjects from the PF-
06881894 group, a positivity for NAb which occurred at day 13 in both of them was confirmed. This 
response was assessed as related to the PEG moiety, not to the filgrastim protein which is accepted. 
The case narrative has been submitted for these 2 subjects (subjects 0301128 and 0301164). In 
summary: 
•  Subject 1 (PF-06881894 group): baseline negative for anti-pegfilgrastim antibody, 
and positive at P1D13 (titer of 40) and P1FU (below the titer cut point); anti-
pegfilgrastim antibody response were not specific for the filgrastim protein moiety; 
baseline negative for anti-PEG antibody but positive in all subsequent tests (peak at 
P1D13 and P2D1: titer of 6400); 1 NAb positive samples at P1D13 (titer of 4, might 
be related to the PEG moiety). NAb did affect PK/PD with greater effect in period 2 
and lesser effect in period 3, and potential correlation with a TEAE of injection site 
rash. 
•  Subject 2 (PF-06881894 group): baseline negative for anti-pegfilgrastim antibody, 
positive at P1D13 (titer of 320) and continue to be positive but declining (to be 
negative at P3FU); anti-pegfilgrastim antibody response were not specific for the 
filgrastim protein moiety; baseline positive for anti-PEG antibody and remained 
positive in all subsequent tests (peak at P1D13, P1FU and P2D1: titer of 3200); 1 
NAb positive samples at P1D13 (titer of 8, might be related to the PEG moiety). NAb 
did not affect PK/PD significantly, no evidence of immunogenicity associated adverse 
event or loss of response. 
Anti-PEG Antibody 
The 111 subjects (72.5%) who were positive for anti-PEG antibodies (i.e. at least once it was 
confirmed during the study) were as follows: 36 subjects in the PF-06881894 group (24.3%), 39 
subjects in the pegfilgrastim-US group (26.7%) and 36 subjects in the pegfilgrastim-EU group 
(24.3%).

The first occurrence of anti-PEG antibody across all treatments occurred in P1D1 (pre-existing), P1D13, 
or P1D30 (follow-up) with exception of 1 subject that was first positive in P3D1 prior to dosing with 
study drug. The anti-PEG antibody response was balanced by titre across study drugs. The data 
demonstrated a consistent and prominent anti-PEG antibody response across all study drugs, with a 
majority of subjects with pre-existing or early onset (P1D13) anti PEG antibody.  
As recommended during the (Co) Rapporteur pre-submission meeting, the applicant was asked to 
clarify if the difference in distribution of anti-PEG antibody titre quartile has been studied and 
discussed. Based on the applicant’s response, it is accepted that in this study, the distribution of the 
anti-PEG antibody titers across the visits was similar in the PF 06881894, pegfilgrastim-US, and 
pegfilgrastim-EU treatment groups (with a maximum titer reached on P1D13). 
Effect of Immunogenicity on Safety 
TEAEs which occurred in the 10 subjects who had at least 1 positive anti-pegfilgrastim antibody sample 
at any visit including baseline were described by the applicant by treatment period. The SOCs for the 
most commonly reported TEAEs across the 3 study drugs were Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue 
Disorders (10 subjects), Nervous System Disorders (9 subjects), and General Disorders and 
Administration Site Conditions (8 subjects). The most common TEAEs across the 3 study drugs were 
musculoskeletal pain (10 subjects) and headache (9 subjects). All 10 subjects reported at least 1 drug-
related TEAE. 
Overall, no meaningful differences were observed between the 3 treatment groups for the reported 
TEAEs in subjects who had at least 1 positive anti-pegfilgrastim antibody sample at least once during 
the study (no subjects were anti-pegfilgrastim positive at baseline). 
Three subjects who reported TEAEs in SMQs (narrow) Hypersensitivity, Anaphylactic Reactions and 
Angioedema in study ZIN-130-1505 confirmed positive treatment-emergent anti-pegfilgrastim 
antibody at least once during the study: 
-  One subject (0301190) experienced non-treatment related TEAEs of rhinitis allergic (due to 
concurrent illness) in pegfilgrastim-US group in Period 1. This subject was confirmed positive 
for anti-pegfilgrastim antibody at the P1D13 visit, and specificity testing was positive for 
filgrastim. 
-  One subject (0301128) experienced treatment related TEAE of injection site rash in PF-
06881894 group in Period 1. The subject also experienced an additional treatment related 
Injection site rash in pegfilgrastim-US in Period 2. This subject was confirmed positive for anti 
pegfilgrastim antibody during the P1D13 and Period 1 Follow-up visits, and the specificity 
testing was negative for filgrastim; the subject was positive for NAb at the P1D13 visit (see 
before). 
-  One subject (0301164) experienced non-treatment related TEAEs of vessel puncture site rash 
in PF-06881894 group in Period 1. This subject was confirmed positive for anti pegfilgrastim 
antibody beginning at the P1D13 visit through P3D13, and the specificity testing was negative 
for filgrastim; the subject was positive for NAb at the P1D13 visit (see before). 
The remaining subjects confirmed negative for anti-pegfilgrastim antibodies.  
Seven of the subjects who reported ISRs in study ZIN-130-1505 were confirmed positive anti-
pegfilgrastim antibody at least once during the study. However, only the following 2 subjects reported 
potential hypersensitivity-related ISRs (the remaining ISRs were injection site pain and injection site 
bruising): 
Assessment report

Page 68/82 
 
 
 
-  Subject 0301001 experienced treatment related Injection site erythema in pegfilgrastim-EU 
group in Period 2. This subject was confirmed positive for anti-pegfilgrastim antibody at the 
P1D13 visit, and specificity testing was positive for filgrastim. 
-  Subject 0301128 experienced treatment related Injection site rash in PF-06881894 in Period 1 
(see before).  
Based on the analysis of reported TEAEs from the SMQs Hypersensitivity, Anaphylactic reactions and 
Angioedema and Injection site reactions, the confirmation of positive anti-pegfilgrastim antibody 
results did not reveal any effect. The differences between given treatment groups are considered minor 
and not revealing any concerns.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In both studies, there are few discontinuations due to TEAEs with no apparent difference between the 
PF-06881894 and Neulasta. 
Study ZIN-130-1505 
A total of 2 subjects discontinued the study due to TEAEs. One subject who received PF-06881894 
experienced a spontaneous abortion which was assessed as unrelated to study drug. Another subject 
who received pegfilgrastim-US experienced a generalised rash assessed as possibly related to study 
drug in regard of its known potential for allergic reactions. 
Three subjects were permanently discontinued from study drug administration; 1 subject who received 
PF-06881894 was discontinued from the study drug due to a non-drug-related abortion spontaneous, 
and 2 subjects who received pegfilgrastim-US were discontinued from study drug administration due to 
TEAEs of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased determined to be possibly related to study drug 
and rash generalised determined to be possibly related to study drug. 
Plus, another subject from the pegfilgrastim-US group was erroneously reported to be permanently 
discontinued from the study drug by the investigator. This subject experienced an injection site pain 
after the final scheduled dose of study drug.  
Study C1221005 
A total of 46 subjects (10.9%) discontinued from the study. The reason for the discontinuation from 
the study included lost to follow-up (18 subjects), protocol deviations (2 subjects), withdrawal by 
subject (14 subjects), no longer met eligibility criteria (1 subject), other reasons (9 subjects) and 
2 subjects discontinued the study due to AEs. 
One subject each in the PF-06881894 group and the pegfilgrastim-US group was permanently 
discontinued from study drug and the study due to TEAEs. One subject from the PF-06881894 group 
had urinary tract infection (reported as SAE) and another one from the pegfilgrastim-US study 
discontinued due to nonserious angioedema. The event of urinary tract infection was moderate in 
severity and was considered not related to the study drug by the investigator. TEAE of angioedema 
was considered related to the study drug. Angioedema is listed as an adverse reaction in the SmPC for 
reference medicinal product. 
The appropriate narratives related to the concerned cases were provided accordingly. The analysis of 
the cases with discontinuation due to TEAEs did not provide any new safety findings or concerns in 
association with PF-06881894.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety assessment was focused on two comparative clinical studies, i.e. two Phase I studies (ZIN-
130-1505  and  C1221005)  including  heathy  subjects,  and  one  supportive  non-comparative  Phase  I-
II study  (ZIN-130-1504)  including  subjects  with  non-metastatic  breast  cancer.  The  safety  results  per 
individual sections of the data submitted were mostly presented separately  for each study and in the 
conclusions the data from two comparative clinical studies were pooled. 
As mentioned in the scientific advice (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/720012/2017), the CHMP agrees that the clinical 
dossier for a biosimilar application for a PEG-filgrastim may comprise of healthy volunteer trials only, 
provided  that  biosimilarity  can  be  sufficiently  demonstrated  based  on  a  strong  and  convincing 
physicochemical and functional data package and comparable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
profiles  including  safety/immunogenicity  data.  The  open-label  design  chosen  for  both  comparative 
studies  is  regrettable,  as  the  reporting  of  adverse  effects  (e.g.,  injection  site  reactions)  can  be 
confounded by the taken approach since the subjects and observers are aware of the actual treatment. 
Overall, the provided safety database could be considered sufficient to establish the safety profile of this 
medicinal  product.  However,  as  the  manner  of  adverse  event  (AE)  analysis,  without  involvement  of 
multiple occurrence of the concrete adverse event/reaction (i.e. more than once) in individual subjects, 
might lead to inaccuracy and bias in the incidence proportion of adverse events in given study groups, 
the applicant was requested to provide an explanation regarding the conducted process and eventually 
add  the  tabulated  summaries  of  reported  TEAEs  indicating  the  exact  number  of  adverse  events  per 
individual subjects with appropriate discussion. Therefore, the applicant provided 4 additional tabulated 
summaries  of  reported  TEAEs  (2  per  Study  C1221005  and  2  per  Study  ZIN-130-1505)  indicating  the 
total number of events relevant for each PT as reported AE and reported TEAE, separately. It enables a 
more comprehensive assessment of potential differences between the treatment groups. 
Based  on  the  presented  numbers  of  events,  no  new  significant  differences  between  the  mentioned 
treatment  groups  in  terms  of  SOC  and  PT  MedDRA  terms  were  identified  except  of  SOC  Respiratory, 
thoracic and mediastinal disorders and SOC General disorders and administration site conditions. 
In  the  studies  ZIN-130-1505  and  C1221005,  healthy  male  or  female  were  enrolled.  Regarding  the 
demographic and baseline characteristics of enrolled population, the mean age, ethnicity, or mean BMI 
were comparable between the treatment groups in both studies. Only the sex ratio was slightly different 
between groups. 
The  frequencies  and  pattern  of  TEAEs  were  similar  between  PF-06881894  or  pegfilgrastim-US  and 
pegfilgrastim-EU in Studies ZIN-130-1505 and C1221005, and in line with the SmPC for Neulasta. Most 
TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity. No new significant safety information to the established safety 
profile of Neulasta was identified. 
The most frequently reported treatment-related TEAEs were musculoskeletal disorders (musculoskeletal 
pain, back pain and headache). Of note, no deaths were reported in the concerned clinical studies. Only 
4 subjects experienced treatment emergent SAEs (3 subjects in study ZIN-130-1505 and 1 subject in 
study C1221005) which were not related to study drugs.  
A  few  subjects  discontinued  the  studies  due  to  TEAEs.  Further,  there  were  few  cases  of  spontaneous 
abortion. As per study protocols, all subjects had to use an adequate method of contraception to prevent 
pregnancy throughout the course of the study. Among the cases which led to discontinuation of the study 
drug and assessed as related or possibly related to study drug they were due to known adverse reactions 
per pegfilgrastim, such as generalised rash, ALT increased and angioedema. Specific recommendations 
are  provided  in  section  4.6  of  the  SmPC;  Pegfilgrastim  is  not  recommended  during  pregnancy  and  in 
women of childbearing potential not using contraception.

In the Study C1221005, an imbalance in the direction of higher incidence per PF-06881894 group could 
be  found  for  the  TEAEs  of  all  causalities  assigned  to  the  SOC  Respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal 
disorders.  In  case  of  the  PF-06881894  group,  in  34  subjects  (16.2%)  any  TEAE  under  this  SOC  was 
reported in contrast to the pegfilgrastim-US group which included only 14 subjects (6.7%) relevant for 
this condition. The most frequently reported PTs for this SOC were PT Oropharyngeal pain (6 cases of 
treatment-related AEs in the PF-06881894 group) and PT Dyspnoea (6 cases of treatment-related AEs 
in the PF-06881894 group). Most of the cases of oropharyngeal pain were mild in severity (5 of 6 cases). 
In  the  remaining  one  case,  the  severity  was  assessed  as  moderate.  In  general,  the  events  of 
oropharyngeal  pain  do  not  suggest  a  pulmonary  disorder  as  a  cause  for  these  events.  The  observed 
cases  were  accompanied  by  other  confounding  factors  such  as  headache  or  other  types  of 
musculoskeletal pain. The appropriate justification including the causality assessment was provided by 
the applicant. In terms of PT Dyspnoea, 6 events of dyspnoea (in 6 subjects) for PF-06881894 and no 
events  (in  0 subjects)  for  US-Neulasta  assessed  as  treatment-related  were  reported.  All these  events 
resolved without treatment and were considered mild. No significant issue was identified. 
Treatment-emergent AESI were overall comparable between the treatment groups in both study ZIN-
130-1505 and study C1221005. No clinically meaningful differences between the AESI reported in the 
study drug groups were identified (including treatment-emergent Musculoskeletal Disorders and ISRs). 
However, in the Study C1221005, based on the tabulated summaries the incidence of both TEAEs of all 
causalities and treatment-related TEAEs assigned to the SOC General disorders and administration site 
conditions  observed  for  PF-06881894  was  higher  in  contrast  to  pegfilgrastim-US.  In  case  of  the 
treatment-related TEAEs, the difference of 5.3% per this SOC is present, concretely 20.5% and 15.2%, 
respectively.  The  appropriate  comparison  of  these  results  to  the  known  safety  profile  of  reference 
medicinal product was provided. The most frequently reported PTs from this SOC were PT Non-cardiac 
chest pain, PT Injection site pain and PT Fatigue. Of note, none of the treatment-related AEs assigned 
to this SOC were assessed as serious. Based on the reassessment of respective data, it was agreed that 
due to all the circumstances surrounding the observed cases such as concurrently reported treatment-
related adverse events, the known safety profile of Neulasta (i.e. frequency of relevant ADRs listed in 
the EU SmPC) or presence of other underlying conditions, the existing differences between the treatment 
groups in the Study C1221005 do not indicate any significant safety findings. 
No  new  significant  safety  information  to  the  known  safety  profile  of  pegfilgrastim  in  the  context  of 
adverse events could be identified. 
Laboratory  parameters  were  analysed  and  no  significant  abnormalities  were  detected  in  general.  Per 
both comparative studies, in regard of the haematology parameters, a decrease in platelet count and 
decrease or increase in lymphocyte count following the administration of each study drug were observed. 
Regarding  the  clinical  chemistry,  according  to  the  SmPC  for  Neulasta,  the  elevations  in  lactate 
dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase occurred in each study drug. The levels returned to the baseline 
by  the  follow-up  visit.  Further,  ALT,  ALP  and  creatinine  increased  were  reported  in  all  groups.  The 
urinalysis and PCR (protein-creatinine ratio) were conducted for all subjects as defined by protocol and 
also in line with the relevant warning present in the product information for Neulasta. No evidence of 
glomerulonephritis for any subject was reported. The laboratory findings were consistent with the known 
safety profile of Neulasta in general. No relevant difference was observed between the PF-06881894 and 
reference medicinal products. 
Consistent with the individual Studies ZIN-130-1505 and C1221005 no clinically meaningful differences 
between  PF-06881894  and  pegfilgrastim-US  were  identified  per  the  review  of  the  pooled  safety  data 
from  studies  ZIN-130-1505  and  C1221005.  Overall,  across  the  2  comparative  studies,  and  although 
some minor concerns remain, there were no clinically meaningful differences between the safety profile 
of the proposed biosimilar and Neulasta, and results were similar to the labels.

A specific information on establishment of immunogenicity was provided. The evaluation of submitted 
data  and  outline  of  respective  immunogenicity  evaluation  demonstrated  a  consistent  and  prominent 
response to antibodies across all study drugs.  
The immunogenicity of PF-06881894, pegfilgrastim-US, and pegfilgrastim-EU was first assessed in a 3 
arm  crossover  PD/PK  equivalence  study 
in  healthy  volunteers  (ZIN-130-1505,  exploratory 
immunogenicity assessment). Therefore, the proposed comparative immunogenicity study C1221005 is 
acceptable (demonstration of equivalence between PF-06881894 and pegfilgrastim-US). 
Results from the comparative immunogenicity study C1221005 have been reported to meet the statistical 
criteria for non-inferiority of PF-06881894 vs pegfilgrastim-US with respect to immunogenicity (with a 
10% 
non-inferiority  margin). 
However, 
as 
discussed 
in 
the 
scientific 
advice 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/720012/2017), in the EU, a formal non-inferiority study is not requested for safety 
data.  For  comparative  immunogenicity  assessment,  the  parallel  group  design  of  study  C1221005  is 
adequate. 
In C1221005 study, no meaningful differences were observed between the percentages of subjects with 
negative  baseline  anti-pegfilgrastim  antibody  and  confirmed  postdose  positive  anti-pegfilgrastim 
antibody test in the 2 treatment groups. Among the subjects who were negative for anti-pegfilgrastim 
antibody  at  baseline,  a  total  of  12 subjects  in  the  PF-06881894  group  and  15 subjects  in  the 
pegfilgrastim-US  group  were  confirmed  as  positive  for  anti-pegfilgrastim  antibody  (i.e.  had  at  least  1 
positive antibody) postdose. 
In  regard  of  the  presence  of  NAb,  it  was  negative  for  all  subjects  with  the  negative  baseline  of  anti-
pegfilgrastim antibodies. One subject in the PF-06881894 group with positive baseline anti-pegfilgrastim 
antibody result was found to be NAb positive at 2 postdose visits, which may affect ANC in the second 
treatment  period  compared  to  ANC  trends  in  other  subjects  with  and  without  anti-pegfilgrastim 
antibodies. For this subject, the anti-pegfilgrastim antibody responses were not specific for the filgrastim 
protein moiety.  
Regarding the Study ZIN-130-1505, no subjects were anti-pegfilgrastim positive at baseline. Compared 
to  the  number  of  subjects  with  positive  anti-pegfilgrastim  antibodies  at  least  once  postdose  (n  =  10 
subjects, i.e. 6.5%), there were 111 subjects (i.e. 72.5%) positive for anti-PEG antibodies.  
Overall, there was a slightly higher percentage of subjects with anti-pegfilgrastim positive samples for 
PF-06881894 (6 subjects in PF-06881894 group vs. 2 in pegfilgrastim-US and 2 in pegfilgrastim-EU). 
However, 5 of the 10 anti-pegfilgrastim positive subjects had only 1 positive sample during the study: 4 
subjects who received PF-06881894 and 1 subject who received pegfilgrastim-US. Each of these samples 
was low titre (<20 to 40) and there was no evidence of NAb. These results could be consistent with a 
false positive antibody test.  
The percentage of subjects with anti-pegfilgrastim antibody positive samples was balanced across study 
drugs when considering only the subjects with more than 1 positive sample: 2 subjects in PF-06881894 
group vs. 1 in pegfilgrastim-US and 2 in pegfilgrastim-EU. 
This  slightly  higher  overall  percentage  of  subjects with  positive  anti-pegfilgrastim  antibody  results  for 
PF-06881894 could be considered as acceptable due to the results at final visit (i.e. follow-up visit) when 
only 2 subjects were positive for anti-pegfilgrastim antibody. The lasting of positive anti-pegfilgrastim 
antibody results per given study groups did not reveal any difference that would indicate a new trend.  
The percentage of NAb was low in this study. Out of the 10 anti-pegfilgrastim antibody positive subjects, 
none  of  the  subjects  receiving  pefgilgrastim-US  or  pegfilgrastim-EU  had  sample  positive  for  NAb. 
However, 2 subjects from the PF-06881894 group were confirmed NAb-positive. However, the results 
suggested that the NAb was related to the PEG moiety, not the filgrastim protein moiety.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/603684/2020  
Page 72/82 
 
 
 
The 111 subjects who were positive for anti-PEG antibodies (i.e. at least once it was confirmed during 
the study) were as follows: 36 subjects in the PF-06881894 group, 39 subjects in the pegfilgrastim-US 
group and 36 subjects in the pegfilgrastim-EU group. The anti-PEG response was balanced across both 
study drugs with respect to percentage and titre. 
Overall, in Studies ZIN-130-1505 and C1221005, no effect on ANC by the presence of anti pegfilgrastim 
antibody  was  noted.  Based  on  the  analysis  of  reported  TEAEs  from  the  SMQs  Hypersensitivity, 
Anaphylactic reactions and Angioedema and Injection site reactions, the confirmation of positive anti-
pegfilgrastim  antibody  results  did  not  reveal  any  effect.  In  summary,  overall,  there  were  no  clinically 
meaningful differences in the ADA assessment results or in the effect of immunogenicity on the safety 
results across the treatments groups. 
As required, the immunogenicity results observed using the confirmatory CP with a false-positive rate of 
1% for the studies (instead of 0.1%) has been submitted. For study C1221005, although the number of 
subjects  with  negative  baseline  anti-pegfilgrastim  antibody  and  confirmed  postdose  positive  anti-
pegfilgrastim  antibody  at  any  visit  increase,  the  number  is  similar  between  PF-06881894  and 
pegfilgrastim-US.  For  study  ZIN-130-1505,  the  numbers  of  patients  with  positive  anti-pegfilgrastim 
antibody remain close to the numbers observed with the confirmatory CP with a false-positive rate of 
0.1%.  
Although  NAb  were  observed  for  3  samples  in  the  PF-06881894  group  (C1221005  &  ZIN-130-1505), 
none were positive in the reference groups (pegfilgrastim-US/EU). With regard to the effect of NAb on 
safety, only for 1 of the 3 subjects a potential correlation with a TEAE of injection site rash was observed. 
In  conclusion,  based  on  data  in  a  very  low  number  of  patients  in  whom  NAb  could  be  observed,  the 
presence of NAb did not appear to result in reduced clinical response or increased risk for injection site 
reactions. Although NAb were observed for 3 samples in the PF-06881894 group (C1221005 & ZIN-130-
1505), it is reasonable to assume that it could be due to a more sensitive assay used here compared to 
the one use at the time of Neulasta approval. As the number of NAb positive samples in PF-06881894 is 
very  low,  the  difference  with  the  number  of  NAb  positive  samples  in  the  references  could  be  chance 
finding. 
There was one additional study, i.e. open-label, non-comparative study Phase I-II ascending single- and 
multiple- dose Study ZIN-130-1504. In this study a total of 25 subject were exposed to at least 1 dose 
of PF-06881894. This study included female subjects with non-distantly metastatic cancer with a mean 
age of 59.3 years. This study was conducted in the EU. Presented adverse events were consistent with 
the known safety profile of Neulasta. No deaths were reported and no subjects were discontinued from 
the study due to adverse events. There were no new immunogenicity concerns with PF-06881894. None 
of  the  subjects  were  confirmed  positive  for  anti-pegfilgrastim  antibody.  In  this  study  there  were  no 
significant differences in vital sign, ECG or physical examination. The clinical laboratory findings were 
consistent  with  the  known  safety  profile  of  pegfilgrastim.  This  study  did  not  provide  any  new  safety 
information in association with PF-06881894. As this study was non-comparative, it was not considered 
integral for the clinical development package. This is accepted. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The  safety  data  from  the  2  comparative  clinical  studies  conducted  in  healthy  subjects  support  the 
biosimilarity  of  PF-06881894  to  Neulasta.  The  incidence  of  events,  their  nature  and  severity  were  in 
general similar between Nyvepria (PF-06881894) and Neulasta groups in both studies. Overall, reported 
adverse drug reactions were as described in the Neulasta PI.  
In the context of immunogenicity, overall, the review of percentages of subjects with positive ADA/NAb 
and immune-mediated AEs in subjects with positive anti-pegfilgrastim antibodies from the clinical studies 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/603684/2020  
Page 73/82 
 
 
 
in  healthy  subjects  does  not  suggest  any  clinically  meaningful  differences  between  PF-06881894  and 
Neulasta,  and  was  consistent  with  the  established  safety  and  immunogenicity  profile  of  Neulasta  as 
reflected in the labels (low immunogenicity). Further, the results from these studies do not suggest any 
impact of ADA on the PD or PK profile of PF-06881894. Similar to Neulasta, and in order to minimise the 
risk, Healthcare Professionals are warned about the risk of immunogenicity in section 4.4 of the SmPC 
for Nyvepria. 
The safety profile of this biosimilar containing pegfilgrastim called Nyvepria is considered comparable 
to the reference medicinal product.

3.  Biosimilarity assessment 
3.1.  Comparability exercise and indications claimed 
PF-06881894 (Nyvepria) has been developed as a similar biological medicinal product to Neulasta (INN: 
pegfilgrastim) (6 mg solution, prefilled syringe ready to use, for manual subcutaneous injection) which 
was approved in the European Union (EU) in August 2002 (EMEA/H/C/000420, Amgen Europe B.V., the 
Netherlands). 
The  PF-06881894  dosing  regimen  (frequency  and  duration),  route  of  administration,  the  proposed 
indication and patient population are identical to those approved for Neulasta. 
The  proposed  indication  is:  “Reduction  in  the  duration  of  neutropenia  and  the  incidence  of  febrile 
neutropenia in adult patients treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the exception of 
chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes)”. 
Quality 
For the biosimilarity analysis, the applicant performed an extensive comparability exercise including side-
by-side testing by a combination of orthogonal analytical methods, which are properly qualified, and by 
using up to 17 batches of pegfilgrastim-EU and pegfilgrastim-US and up to 10 batches of Nyvepria FP. 
The quality biosimilarity testing programme included a combination of physicochemical, biochemical and 
biological activity tests, which covered all important quality attributes of pegfilgrastim. Also, comparative 
degradation studies were performed to study the degradation profile of Nyvepria and EU- and US-sourced 
Neulasta. Taken together, the quality biosimilarity analysis was in compliance with the applicable EMA 
guidance (CHMP/437/04 Rev 1 and EMA/CHMP/BWP/247713/201). 
Non-clinical 
The nonclinical development programme for this application consisted of in vitro and in vivo studies to 
assess  the  biosimilarity  between  pegfilgrastim  PF-06881894  (Nyvepria)  and  Neulasta  sourced  from 
Europe and the US.  
The  non-clinical  programme  followed  the  Guideline  on  similar  biological  medicinal  products 
(CHMP/437/04  Rev  1)  and  the  Guideline  on  similar  biological  medicinal  products  containing 
biotechnology-derived 
proteins 
as 
active 
substance: 
non-clinical 
and 
clinical 
issues 
(EMA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev 1.). The applicant also sought Scientific Advice from the European 
Medicines Agency in November 2017 – in particular - on the acceptability of the proposed plan to evaluate 
the analytical and functional similarity of PF-06881894 to the reference product and on the supportive 
role of the 4-week repeated dose toxicity study performed in the rat. 
The assays used included an in vitro cell-based proliferation assay, a competitive receptor binding assay 
(CRBA),  and  a  Surface  Plasmon  Resonance  (SPR)  assay  for  determination  of  receptor  binding  affinity 
(KD and Relative KD) and the binding rate kinetics (kon and koff). These functional assays are directly 
related  to  the  pegfilgrastim  therapeutic  mechanism  of  action  that  involves  pegfilgrastim  binding  to 
receptors on the surface of hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow followed by concentration-dependent 
cell proliferation and differentiation. The methods used are appropriate and the in vitro assays have been 
validated or qualified.  
The  pharmacological  activity  of  PF-06881894  was  also  assessed  in  the  rat  as  part  of  a  4-week 
comparative  toxicity  study.  This  animal  study  is  only  considered  as  supportive  for  the  biosimilarity 
assessment.

Clinical 
The  clinical  development  programme  was  discussed  during  the  EMA  scientific  advice  the  applicant 
received for the PF-06881894 development in 2017 (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/720012/2017).  
The comparative exercise for clinical similarity assessment included 2 studies in healthy volunteers: a 
randomised  single-dose  cross-over  PD/PK  study  (ZIN-130-1505)  comparing  PF-06881894  to 
pegfilgrastim-US and pegfilgrastim-EU; and a randomised multiple dose parallel design non-inferiority 
immunogenicity study (C1221005) comparing PF-06881894 to pegfilgrastim-US. It should be noted that 
the  comparative  immunogenicity  study  (C1221005)  had  already  started  at  the  time  of  the  scientific 
advice. Its design was selected based on FDA Guidance for Industry. A blinded design would have been 
ideally preferred, and the proposed non-inferiority design is not requested for safety data. 
However, the CHMP has agreed that the clinical dossier for a biosimilar application for a PEG-filgrastim 
may  comprise  of  healthy  volunteer  trials  only,  provided  that  biosimilarity  can  be  sufficiently 
demonstrated  based  on  a  strong  and  convincing  physicochemical  and  functional  data  package  and 
comparable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles. 
In the comparative immunogenicity study C1221005, Pfizer proposed to compare the biosimilar and 
pegfilgrastim-US. According to the “Guideline on Similar Biological Medicinal Products” (CHMP/437/04 
Rev 1), the reference medicinal product should be a medicinal product authorised in EEA. However, it 
may be possible in some cases for an applicant to compare the biosimilar in clinical studies with a non-
EEA authorised comparator. In this case, the applicant needs to provide adequate data or information 
to scientifically justify the relevance of these comparative data and establish an acceptable bridge to 
the EEA-authorised reference product. The type of bridging data needed will always include data from 
analytical studies that compare all three products (the proposed biosimilar, the EEA-authorised 
reference product and the non-EEA-authorised comparator), and may also include data from clinical PK 
and/or PD bridging studies for all three products. Since immunogenicity of PF-06881894, pegfilgrastim-
US, and pegfilgrastim-EU was previously assessed in a 3 arm crossover PD/PK equivalence study in 
healthy volunteers (ZIN-130-1505) demonstration of equivalence between PF-06881894 against a 
single reference product (e.g. pegfilgrastim-US) in the proposed comparative immunogenicity study is 
acceptable.   
3.2.  Results supporting biosimilarity 
Regarding  the  analytical  similarity,  the  Company  has  conducted  a  robust  and  extensive  overall 
biosimilarity  exercise  including  a  panel  of  highly  sophisticated  and  state-of-the  art  methods,  which 
characterises  and  compares  the  relevant  physicochemical  and  biological  quality  attributes  of  the 
pegfilgrastim molecule.  
Quality 
In general, all quality attributes analysed proved to be highly similar between Nyvepria and both EU- 
and  US-sourced  Neulasta.  The  amino  acid  sequence  is  identical  to  the  RMP  and  primary  structure 
regarding pegylation site and linker composition, intact mass, free thiol and pI is consistent amongst all 
lots. A minor shift to higher molecular weight is observed for the PEG moiety, which is attributable to 
mPEG  lot-to-lot  variability.  However,  molecular  weight  dispersity  and  mPEG  mass  distribution  were 
similar between Nyvepria and the RMP. Furthermore, secondary and tertiary structures are demonstrated 
to be consistent and highly similar between Nyvepria and both EU- and US-sourced Neulasta. 
Product-related substances and impurities appeared to be slightly higher in  both EU- and US-sourced 
Neulasta compared to Nyvepria, especially with regards to total related proteins, total charge variants, 
and total size variants. Based on the data presented, the difference in age of all Nyvepria and Neulasta 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/603684/2020  
Page 77/82 
 
 
 
lots  at  the  time  of  testing  is  not  considered  contributing  to  these  observations.  Therefore,  the  lower 
levels  of  product-related  substances  and  impurities  rather  suggest  that  Nyvepria  has  a  higher  purity 
profile. Individual size variants were evaluated separately for the purpose of biosimilar comparability by 
the applicant upon request and the analysis showed consistent results between Nyvepria and Neulasta 
lots. In general, the differences observed were small and not considered clinically relevant. In addition, 
comparative  stability  and  forced  degradation  studies  showed  that  the  rates,  routes  and  profile  of 
degradation of pegfilgrastim protein in all products (i.e. Nyvepria, pegfilgrastim-EU, and pegfilgrastim-
US) are comparable (i.e. similar increase in the identified impurities over time), further supporting the 
similarity claim. 
Furthermore,  all  finished  product  attributes  concerning  protein  concentration,  deliverable  volume, 
deliverable  content,  appearance,  colour,  clarity,  pH,  osmolality,  polysorbate  20  content,  and  visible 
particles are demonstrated to be similar between Nyvepria and both EU- and US-sourced Neulasta, with 
exception of subvisible particles content, which appears to be slightly lower in Nyvepria. 
Moreover,  and  more  importantly,  in  vitro  potency,  relative  potency,  and  receptor  binding  affinity  and 
kinetics  were  highly  similar  for  Nyvepria  and  both  EU-  and  US-sourced  Neulasta.  These  data  further 
confirm  that  the  pegfilgrastim  protein  in  Nyvepria,  EU-  and  US-sourced  Neulasta  have  similar  higher 
order structure and functional conformation, which is required for biological activity. 
To assess biosimilarity, the applicant used a specific statistical approach. The proposed approach using 
wide quality ranges and acceptance criteria was not deemed acceptable as a general principle and should 
be avoided. For each attribute where one or more of the data points fall out of the acceptance ranges, a 
scientifically sound justification should be provided if similarity is claimed. However, it is acknowledged 
that there is no immediate impact on the conclusion of biosimilarity in the current case since the provided 
data show that Nyvepria appears to be highly similar to the reference product EU Neulasta. 
In conclusion, from a quality point of view, Nyvepria can be considered as biosimilar to EU Neulasta. In 
addition,  given  that  biosimilarity  has  also  been  demonstrated  between  EU-  and  US-sourced  Neulasta, 
the quality bridge is considered acceptably established and the use of US-sourced Neulasta lots in clinical 
studies is therefore also considered acceptable. 
Non-clinical 
Several complementary functional assays were utilised to assess pegfilgrastim biological activity as part 
of the PF-06881894 analytical similarity assessment. 
The  relative  potency  of  PF-06881894  and  the  binding  affinity  to  the  G-CSF  receptor  were  compared 
between  PF-06881894  and  EU-  US-Pegfilgrastim  reference  products  by  Competitive  Receptor  Binding 
Assay and Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR).  
The assays used included an in vitro cell-based proliferation assay, a competitive receptor binding assay, 
and  a  Surface  Plasmon  Resonance  (Biacore)  assay  for  determination  of  receptor  binding  affinity  (K D 
and  Relative  K  D)  and  the  binding  rate  kinetics  (k  on  and  k  off).  The  results  provided  show  that  PF-
06881894 relative potency is comprised those obtained from the reference products sourced in Europe 
and  in  the  US.  Similar  binding  affinities  were  also  measured.  Consequently,  it  is  considered  that 
biosimilarity of PF-06881894 (Nyvepria) and Neulasta is established through this in vitro comparative 
assessment.  
In vivo pharmacological activity of PF-06881894 was assessed as part of the 4-week comparative toxicity 
study in rats (Study 1550-064). In rats, the magnitude of the changes in total leukocyte and neutrophil 
counts  were  similar  at  comparable  doses  of  PF-06881894,  pegfilgrastim-US  or  pegfilgrastim-EU 
indicating expected pharmacological effect. However, those in vivo studies have some limitations such 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/603684/2020  
Page 78/82 
 
 
 
as  small  group  size  and,  thus,  the  in  vivo  results  are  regarded  to  have  only  a  supportive  character 
compared to the in vitro results. 
Clinical 
Two comparative clinical studies were conducted. Study ZIN-130-1505 was a PD/PK equivalence study 
in  healthy  volunteers  to  compare  PF-06881894  to  pegfilgrastim-US  and  pegfilgrastim-EU  and  study 
C1221005  was  a  non-inferiority  study  in  healthy  volunteers  to  demonstrate  the  non-inferiority  of  PF-
06881894 versus pegfilgrastim-US with respect to immunogenicity. 
The  clinical  PK  similarity  has  been  shown  within  the  conventional  bioequivalence  acceptance  range  of 
80.00-125.00% for AUC0-t in ZIN-130-1505 with LS mean Ratios (%) (HSP/EU) of 97% (90%CI 90%-
105%).  
The clinical PD similarity between Nyvepria (PF-06881894) and Neulasta has also been  shown, as for 
both primary PD endpoints AUECANC and ANC_Cmax in study ZIN-130-1505, as well as for secondary 
PD  endpoints,  the  95%  CIs  of  the  test/reference  mean  ratio  were  fully  contained  within  the  tighter 
acceptance limits of 90.0-111.0%. 
Overall the safety profile in regard to AEs, SAEs, AESIs, ADRs, laboratory investigations and treatment 
discontinuation  was,  where  applicable,  generally  well  balanced  between  PF-06881894-treated  healthy 
volunteers and Neulasta-treated ones in both ZIN-130-1505 and C1221005 trials. 
Overall, the low proportions of subjects with positive ADA/NAb and immune-mediated AEs in subjects 
with positive anti-pegfilgrastim antibodies from the clinical studies in healthy subjects do not suggest 
clinically  meaningful  differences  between  Nyvepria  (PF-06881894)  and  Neulasta  at  this  point.  These 
observations  were  consistent  with  the  established  safety  and  immunogenicity  profile  of  Neulasta  as 
reflected in the labels (low immunogenicity). Further, the results from these studies do not suggest any 
impact of ADA on the PD or PK profile of Nyvepria (PF-06881894). On a sufficiently overall high-level 
analysis, no unexpected safety/immunogenicity findings were uncovered and Nyvepria appears to have 
a similar profile compared to Neulasta (as established in the product information). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about biosimilarity 
Quality 
The analytical similarity strategy is generally acceptable. To assess biosimilarity, the applicant used a 
statistical approach. The acceptance criterion to pass the similarity claim was defined as: 90% of PF-
06881894  analytical  results  should  lie  within  the  3-sigma  interval.  This  approach  is  not  deemed 
acceptable as a general principle and should be avoided. However, it is acknowledged that there is no 
immediate  impact  on  the  conclusion of  biosimilarity  in  the  current  case  since  the  provided  data  show 
that  Nyvepria  appears  to  be  highly  similar  to  the  reference  product  EU  Neulasta.  Provided  data  were 
highly consistent between Nyvepria and reference products with the exception of total charge variants 
analysis. The recently produced Nyvepria lots consist of significantly reduced content of total charged 
variants  compared  to  reference  product  and  other  Nyvepria  lots  however,  lower  level  of  total  charge 
variants was attributed to a lower level of deamidated impurities. Additionally, absolute percentage of 
these variants is very low and no impact on functional properties was observed. Therefore, no clinically 
meaningful impact is expected. Individual size variants were evaluated in context of analytical similarity 
and results were found to be similar among Nyvepria and Neulasta reference products. Analytical reports 
and  raw  data  for  representative  lots  tested  in  the  analytical  similarity  assessment  were  provided  and 
support  the  conclusion  on  biosimilarity.  No  remaining  concerns  were  identified  from  the  quality 
perspective that would contradict the biosimilarity claim.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/603684/2020  
Page 79/82 
 
 
 
In conclusion, there are no remaining uncertainties and limitations that have an impact on the conclusion 
of biosimilarity of Nyvepria and Neulasta. 
Non-clinical 
Regarding  the  non-clinical  aspects  of  this  application,  there  are  no  remaining  uncertainties  and 
limitations that have an impact on the conclusion of biosimilarity.  
Clinical 
From the clinical safety perspective, data are limited to studies in healthy volunteers receiving one or 
two  doses  of  PF-06881894.  This  is  acceptable  in  the  development  of  a  pegfilgrastim  biosimilar  since 
adverse events related to exaggerated pharmacological effects (e.g., leukocytosis, splenomegaly, bone 
pain) can be expected at similar frequencies if functional, PK and PD profiles can be demonstrated to be 
comparable. 
Furthermore, a slightly higher percentage of subjects who had NAb positive samples was observed in 
the PF-06881894 group (1 in C1221005 & 2 in ZIN-130-1505) compared to none in the reference 
groups (pegfilgrastim-US/EU). However, based on these data in a very low number of patients in 
whom NAb could be observed, this is considered a chance finding and the presence of NAb did not 
appear to result in reduced clinical response or increased risk for injection site reactions. 
3.4.    Discussion on biosimilarity 
In the development of a biosimilar product, there is no requirement to demonstrate benefit to the patient 
per se as this has been shown for the reference product. The benefits and risks are inferred from the 
similarity of the test product to the reference product in terms of the totality of evidence collected from 
the quality, non-clinical and clinical data. 
Quality 
For the biosimilarity analysis, the applicant performed an extensive comparability exercise including a 
combination of physicochemical, biochemical and biological activity tests. In general, the results obtained 
for Nyvepria, EU Neulasta and US Neulasta were highly similar for quality parameters analysed. Impurity 
levels were slightly lower in Nyvepria, but this is not considered to have any impact on biological safety 
and/or efficacy of the product. Therefore, from a quality point of view, Nyvepria can be considered as 
biosimilar to EU Neulasta. In addition, given that biosimilarity has also been demonstrated between EU- 
and  US-sourced  Neulasta,  the  quality  bridge  is  considered  acceptably  established  and  the  use  of  US-
sourced Neulasta lots in clinical studies is therefore also considered acceptable.  
Non-clinical 
From a non-clinical perspective, the results of the in vitro assays show similarity between PF-06881894 
and  the  reference  product  sourced  from  either  Europe  or  the  US.  Those  assays  were  performed  on  a 
sufficient  number  of  batches,  with  appropriate  methods  and  have  been  qualified.  They  are  therefore 
deemed suitable to claim biosimilarity between PF-06881894 and the reference product Neulasta.  
Pharmacokinetics 
The  claim  of  PK  equivalence  is  supported  since  the  90%  CIs  of  the  test/reference  ratio  for  both  the 
primary  and  secondary  PK  parameters  were  fully  contained  within  the  acceptance  interval  of  80.00-
125.00%.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/603684/2020  
Page 80/82 
 
 
 
 
 
Pharmacodynamics 
Overall PD data support a high degree of similarity between PF-06881894 and Neulasta, since the 95% 
CIs of the test/reference ratio for both primary and secondary PD parameters were fully contained within 
the tighter acceptance limits of 90.0-111.0%. 
Clinical safety 
Safety  and  immunogenicity  data  are  currently  supporting  similarity  between  PF-06881894  and 
pegfilgrastim-EU. 
Conclusion 
The  analytical  similarity  exercise  provides  a  comprehensive  data  package  sufficient  to  demonstrate 
biosimilarity. All remaining quality issues on biosimilarity were solved.  
Non-clinical part of the comparability has been found sufficient to demonstrate biosimilarity. All 
remaining issues concerning clinical part (PK, Safety and Immunogenicity profiles) have been solved, 
therefore Nyvepria is considered comparable to the reference medicinal product. 
3.5.  Extrapolation of safety and efficacy 
Neulasta  has  a  well-established  efficacy  and  safety  profile  based  on  both  clinical  studies  and  post-
marketing  experiences,  and  is  authorised  for  the:  “reduction  in  the  duration  of  neutropenia  and  the 
incidence  of  febrile  neutropenia  in  adult  patients  treated  with  cytotoxic  chemotherapy  for  malignancy 
(with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes)”.  
The indication for Nyvepria is the same as per the one of Neulasta. 
Extrapolation of data generated from healthy subjects to patients is possible considering the high 
biosimilarity demonstrated by the product in comparison to the reference medicinal product. 
3.6.  Conclusions on biosimilarity and benefit risk balance 
Based on the review of the submitted data, Nyvepria is considered biosimilar to Neulasta. Therefore, a 
benefit/risk balance comparable to the reference product can be concluded. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Nyvepria is favourable in the following indication: 
“reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in adult patients 
treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia 
and myelodysplastic syndromes)”

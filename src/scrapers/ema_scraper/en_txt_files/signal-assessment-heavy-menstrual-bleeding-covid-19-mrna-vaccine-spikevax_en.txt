1.  Background 
The broad clinical issue of “menstrual disorders” was reviewed in the 8th MSSR for Spikevax. 
The conclusion by the PRAC Rapporteur in the 8th MSSR report with a DLP of 31 August 2021 was the 
following: “The PRAC Rapporteur indeed acknowledges that the currently available evidence is 
insufficient to justify a causal association between menstrual disorders/postmenopausal haemorrhage 
and Spikevax. Routine pharmacovigilance is considered sufficient for monitoring menstrual 
disorders/postmenopausal haemorrhage.” 
However, the issue of menstrual disturbances is somewhat difficult to analyse, due to the range of 
clinical entities included, the difficulty in estimating their background incidences in relevant populations 
and the fact that reports are mainly from patients and lacking thorough clinical evaluation. We 
therefore find it necessary to extract those reactions/patterns that we consider the most severe and 
evaluate these in separate signal procedures. This would make the assessment more tailored to the 
reactions in question. 
We believe that a new evaluation beyond routine pharmacovigilance is warranted, mainly for the 
following reasons: 
1.  The data have changed. Since the time of the 8th MSSR updated AR Norway has received an 
increased numbers  of  reports  of  heavy  menstrual  bleeding.  Most  women  of  reproductive 
age  (18-54  years)  in Norway were vaccinated from the beginning of summer 2021 and 
onwards. (Per 31.05.21 59 873 doses of Spikevax had been given to women aged 18 – 54. 
Per 15.11.21 the exposure was 565 190, i.e., it had increased by a tenfold. The total 
population is 5.4 million) Because of the time that has passed since the MSSR updated AR 
more reports of heavy menstrual bleedings have been received also providing a better clinical 
description of the issue. 
2.  The time that has elapsed  since the DLP of the 8th MSSR (31 Aug 2021) and the volume of 
reports. The  number  of  post-  marketing  reports  included  in  the  review  were  3,619.  A 
more  recent  search  in Vigibase per 14.01.22 yields a result of 16,375 reports of amenorrhea 
globally for “Spikevax”/ “Covid-19 vaccine Moderna” and “Moderna covid –19 vaccine” when 
the same HLTs and PTs were used as were used in the MAH’s search, ie the increase in 
number is substantial. We have gained more knowledge through an increased number of 
reports, which also means more qualitative information/details. 
Based  on  our  own  ICSRs,  we  are  under  the  impression  that  menstrual  disorders  are  by  far  the 
most commonly reported ADR from women. However, we do not have absolute numbers, due to a large 
volume of non-serious cases in backlog. Most of the reports of menstrual disorders are non-serious. 
In Norway, 4,2 million doses of Comirnaty and approx. 1 mill doses of Spikevax have been distributed 
to women per 14.01.22. NoMA has  currently  received  approximately  50 000  ICSRs  in  total  after 
vaccination  with  the covid-19 vaccines, 81% from women. We estimate through manual sampling 
and screening of incoming reports  since  June  when  the  signal/issue  was  first  raised  nationally,  that 
approximately  30%  of  reports received  by  women  could  be  related  to  the issue  of  menstrual 
disturbances. The  large  amount  of these reports relative to the total amount of reports, is a new aspect 
that warrants our attention. 
Normally,  a  menstrual  bleeding  lasts  around  2  –  7  days,  and  women  lose  about  3  to  5  tablespoons 
of blood in a period.

Some reports are categorised as serious due to the long duration or due to hospitalisation. The blood 
loss has in some cases led to syncope, treatment with iron and blood transfusion(s). 
mRNA  vaccines  have been shown  to  be  highly reactogenic and  this could  be  a  biologically plausible 
explanation through secondary stress on the hormonal system. 
COVID-19 vaccination is a powerful immune stimulant.  It is therefore plausible that the sensitive 
immune system  of  the  endometrium  is  briefly  modified  by  vaccination,  thus  potentially  leading 
to  menstrual disorders.  However,  no  systematic  investigations  of  the  effect  of  COVID-19 
vaccination  on  endometrial function  have  been  carried  out  to  date.  A  study  designed  specifically  to 
investigate  this  relationship  is currently ongoing at the Johns Hopkins Department of Gynecology and 
Obstetrics in the USA [1] 
2.  Initial evidence 
2.1.  Signal validation 
Spontaneous reports: 
As  the  majority  of the ICSRs on  the  issue of  menstrual  disturbances are reported and/or classified  as 
non- serious, there is a huge backlog of uncoded/unhandled cases in Norway and most likely in other 
European countries. 
However, per  12  JAN  2022,  for  both  mRNA-vaccines NoMA  has  fully  processed over 3400  ICSRs 
belonging to the SOC  “Reproductive system and breast disorders”  where of 2800 cases belong to the 
HLGT “Menstrual cycle and uterine bleeding disorders” which have been submitted to EudraVigilance. 
NoMA has registered 230 cases belonging to the PT ‘heavy menstrual bleeding’ as of 3 JAN  22, but 
our back log is significant. 
It is interesting to note that LAREB (the Netherlands pharmacovigilance centre) who currently has no 
back log, has registered 558 ICSRs coded with the PT ‘heavy menstrual bleeding’ related to Spikevax 
in their report dated 22.12.21 [3]. 
Positive rechallenge cases: 
NoMA has  registered approximately  100 cases  of  women  experiencing  changes  in  menstrual  cycle 
or bleeding  pattern after  both  the  first  and  second  dose  of  an  mRNA-vaccine  (including  mix  and 
match vaccine schedule). These are indicative of a link between reactions related to menstrual cycle 
and mRNA vaccines. A list of cases could be provided to the PRAC-Rapporteur on request. 
Below are two examples: 
This  case  from  a  health  care  professional  concerns  an  a d u l t   female  patient  who describes  intense 
menstrual  pain  that  she  had  never  experienced  before,  and  large  amounts  of  blood when 
menstruating  after  the  first  dose  of  Spikevax.  After  the  second  dose,  she  experienced  fever, 
extreme  menstrual  pain,  extreme  amounts  of  blood,  nausea,  headache,  cough,  congested  nose 
and fatigue. 
This  is  a  report  from  an adult  consumer who  reports  of  heavy  menstrual  bleeding during 
menstruation after being vaccinated with Spikevax. She states that she experienced the same after her 
first vaccine dose.

Population cohort studies: 
There is an increase in the incidence of menstrual changes among young women after vaccination 
against coronavirus,  according  to  initial  findings  from  population  studies  by  the  Norwegian 
Institute  of  Public Health (N = 6000), age 18 – 30 years). 
This evidence was not available at time of review in the MSSR [4].  
Examples of cases with heavy menstrual bleedings: 
T h i s   c a s e  concerns   a  well  described  health  care  professional  report  o n a  young  woman  who  was 
hospitalised  due  to  severe  bleeding.  An  a d u l t  female,  previously  healthy  with  a  regular  menstrual 
cycle,  who  uses  a  contraceptive  implant,  was  vaccinated  with  a  second  dose  of  Spikevax  on  Q 3  
2 021.  (First dose was Comirnaty) Around47 days after receiving the second dose, she presented 
with a persisting vaginal bleeding. She has at  times  had  to  change  sanitary  products frequently,  and 
the  blood  contained  clots.  She saw the ER around 76 days after receiving the second dose and was 
prescribed tranexamid acid. Two days later she saw the ER again and was admitted due to increased 
lethargy the last few weeks and a reduced general condition, dizziness and nausea. No fever. Syncope 
twice on the day after the visit to the ER, and once two days after the visit to the ER, the day of 
admission. No syncopes in her medical history. No heavy breathing, chest pain, stomach pain or  other 
bleeding  foci.  Hb  measured  at  ER was  measured  4  times  and  was  between  2.0  and  2.9.  When 
admitted to hospital she was exhausted. Blood pressure 109/71mmHg, heart rate 130  –  145  bpm, 
respiratory  frequency  24,  saturation  91%,  normal  clinical  examination  apart  from  pale and 
peripheral  coldness.  Feeling  o f   cold,  but  body  temperature  normal.  Cardiac  murmur  that  can  be 
explained  by  significant  thinning  of  the  blood.  Blood  test  at  admission  shows  Hb  3.0  g/dL,  HCT 
0,11, leucocytes  20.2  (15.7  neutrophiles),  thrombocytes  541,  reticulocytes  120,  serum  iron  1, 
transferritinsaturation  2%,  serum  ferritin  4  microgram/L,  normal  coagulation  status,  electrolytes, 
liver/bile  and  kidney  assays.  Gynecologic  examination confirmed fresh bleeding and the ultrasound 
didn’t show any gynecological morphological abnormalities. At time of reporting, the patent is receiving 
blood transfusions and is monitored in the intensive care unit. 
  C a s e   concerning  a  severe  perimenopausal  menstrual bleeding lasting 5 weeks. An adult woman 
got dizzy and felt unwell minutes after vaccination with Spikevax, first dose, in Q2 2021. The 
following days she experienced several abnormal symptoms and contacted  her  GP.  She  also 
experienced  a  swollen  arm  from  the  elbow  to  the  wrist  with  pruritus  which disappeared after a few 
hours. The patient has not been menstruating for almost one year. But 2-3 months after the first 
dose, she got her period back. She had such a heavy menstrual bleeding that she was unable to 
work some  of the days.  She  became  very unwell  and fainted.  The bleeding  stopped  by itself  after 5 
weeks.  The  fatigue  is  still  present.  She  was  examined  by  her  gynaecologist  and  treated  with 
medroxyprogesterone  to  stop  the  bleeding,  without  any  effect.  She  was  then  treated  with 
tranexamic acid without any effect. 
This is a health care professional report, reporting on herself, concerning an adult female vaccinated 
with Spikevax on Q32021. The reporter states that she started to experience heavy bleeding on the 
day when she received the last dose of Spikevax (the first dose was Pfizer). Bleeding continued until 
the day when the report was submitted (90 days after the last vaccine dose), with 1-2 days not 
bleeding. She had changed a contraceptive implant in the month after the last vaccine dose, but 
bleeding continued. The subject reports not having had her period while having a contraceptive 
implant before.

This  report  concerns  an   a d u l t   female  with  heavy  menstrual  bleeding  4  weeks  after second 
vaccination with the Moderna vaccine. The patient experienced heavy menstruation with a lot of 
large blood clots. She required additional sanitary products and could not leave the house. The 
heavy menstrual bleeding occurred  for  4 days,  during  2 cycles.  Between the  2  months,  she  had 
slight  menstrual  blood loss  every day. Her Hb decreased to 5,6. She was treated with oral ferro pills 
and had a gynecological examination which  revealed  a  thick  endometrium.  No  further 
examinations  were  performed,  and  no  other treatment was given. The patient never had any 
gynecological or menstruation related problems before. No concomitant medication. No covid-19 
infection prior to vaccination. 
This is a serious report from a consumer, concerning an adult female  who  experienced  heavy 
menstrual  bleeding  causing  hospitalisation.  She  reports  of  having heavy menstrual bleeding 4 
hours after administration of the vaccine. Especially the first two days increased number of sanitary 
products were necessary and had to be changed frequently. She was hospitalized  for  three  days 
because  of  very  low  haemoglobin,  iron  decreased,  platelets  too  low  in combination with cardiac 
disorders in her medical history. CT and ultrasound were performed: no results reported. Blood tests 
showed decreased Hb, Fe and thrombocytes (exact values not reported). Treatment consisted  of  iron 
infusion  and  blood  transfusion.  The  patient  is  recovering  from  fatigue,  is recovering  from  heavy 
menstrual  bleeding  2  weeks  after  onset  and  recovered  from  chills.  Concomitant medication: 
Losartan tablet 100mg, hydrochlorothiazide, pantoprazole tablet msr 40 mg, sotalol tablet 40 mg, 
acenocoumarol tablet 1 mg, digoxine tablet 0,125 mg. 
Publications: 
In  a  retrospective  cross-sectional  study  by  Li  et  al.  [5]  laboratory  and  clinical  data  from 
hospitalised women  of  child-bearing  age diagnosed  with  COVID-19 were analysed.  Menstrual  data 
from  177  women were analysed.  The  authors  conclude  that the  average  sex hormone  concentrations 
and  ovarian  reserve did not change significantly. Nearly one-fifth of patients exhibited a menstrual 
volume decrease or cycle prolongation.  The authors propose  that  the menstruation  changes  of  these 
patients  might be  the consequence  of  transient  sex  hormone  changes  caused  by  suppression  of 
ovarian  function  that  quickly resume  after  recovery. It  should  be  noted  that  the  patients  were 
followed  up,  and  84%  returned  to a normal  menstrual  volume  and 99%  returned  to  their  normal 
cycle  within  1-2  months  of  discharge, suggesting  that  changes  in  menstruation  caused  by  covid-
19  were  most  likely  temporary  changes  and resolved in a short period.  One  44-year-old patient 
indicated in the follow-up that she had stopped menstruating for 4 months after COVID-19 onset and 
had excluded pregnancy as a cause, but considering that  she was  within  her  perimenopausal  period, 
they  believed  that  the  observation  time of  menstruation should be extended in her case. 
Recommendation: 
The MAH should review data from clinical trials and post marketing data, including: 
Provide an overview of the age of the female study participants in the reactogenicity subgroup of the 
clinical study, including median age, and provide the number of women of childbearing potential the 
study included. 
Perform a follow up with all female participants of childbearing  age in the clinical trial to investigate 
for any  reaction  related  to  their  menstruation  and  ovulation/fertility,  including  pregnancy  and 
pregnancy outcome.

Analyse a number of post marketing reports to investigate when the time of vaccination took place 
relating to  the  time  of  ovulation,  the  luteal  phase  and  so  on,  in  those  ICSRs  where  the 
information of  the menstrual cycle is known, to see if there might be a pattern. 
2.2.  Signal confirmation  
NO have raised a signal of Heavy Menstrual Bleeding based on evidence retrieved from national signal 
detection activities. In NO there were, per 4 JAN 2022, 230 cases belonging to the PT ‘Heavy 
menstrual bleeding’. It should be noted that NO have processed a large amount of cases related to the 
SOC “Reproductive system and breast disorders”. 
A selection of cases was presented, which included 2 cases of heavy menstrual bleeding after both 1st 
and 2nd dose of Spikevax and 5 cases in temporal association after the 1st or 2nd dose of Spikevax. In 
the cases, ‘heavy menstrual bleeding’ was reported both in relation to very heavy bleeding and 
prolonged bleeding periods exceeding the normal 7 days. Two of the presented cases caused 
hospitalization due to extensive bleeding. Unfortunately, most of the presented cases are missing 
thorough clinical evaluation.  
Since the last evaluation of menstrual disorders in the 8th MSSR (covering 01-31 august 2021), there 
have been an increase in the exposure in women of childbearing age. On 24th of January there were 
reported 2840 cases of ‘heavy menstrual bleeding’ with Spikevax in EudraVigilance. In comparison 
there were reported 1143 cases in the 8th MSSR. 
In addition to the presented cases, a recent Norwegian cohort study finds an increase in incidence of 
menstrual changes among young women (18-39) after vaccination. In this study both “more heavy 
bleeding” and “prolonged bleeding” has been addressed and a higher relative risk have been observed 
for both outcomes in this study. 
Furthermore, it should be noted that in the pivotal P301 clinical trial there was observed a minor 
imbalance regarding “Menorrhagia”. There were observed 0 cases in placebo and 2 cases in the mRNA-
1273 group. 
Considering the above, heavy menstrual bleeding should be further evaluated as new information 
about the risk has arised. The signal is confirmed. 
2.3.  Proposed recommendation 
Based on the newly identified information, a further investigation of Spikevax and heavy menstrual 
bleeding is warranted. 
The MAH (Moderna) is requested to provide an analysis of heavy menstrual bleeding as described in 
the list of questions below:  
List of Questions for Spikevax MAH on heavy menstrual bleeding: 
1.  The MAH should provide an updated cumulative review of heavy menstrual bleeding cases from 
all sources, including, but not limited to, post marketing and clinical trials. The case review 
should include a WHO-UMC Causality assessment, and a justification of causality category 
should be given for each case.  
Signal assessment on heavy menstrual bleeding with COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (Spikevax)  
EMA/PRAC/897385/2022  
Page 8/64 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a.  It should be noted when the  time  of  vaccination  took  place relating to the time of 
ovulation, the luteal phase and so on, in those ICSRs where the information of the 
menstrual cycle is known, to see if there might be a pattern.  
b.  Focus should be on well described cases, where risk factors and medical history is 
included. 
2.  The MAH should provide an overview and clinical evaluation of cases of heavy menstrual 
bleeding, reported during pivotal clinical trials. The clinical evaluation should include age, 
childbearing potential, reported risk factors for heavy menstrual bleeding, and patient medical 
history including previous menstruation pattern. 
3.  Investigate the feasibility to perform a follow up with all female participants of childbearing 
age in the pivotal clinical trials to investigate for any  reaction  related  to  their  menstruation 
and  ovulation/fertility,  including  pregnancy  and  pregnancy outcome. 
4.  The MAH should carry out a literature review of the association between heavy menstrual 
bleeding and COVID-19 mRNA vaccines with focus on Spikevax. Furthermore, the MAH should 
discuss the study “Increased occurrence of menstrual disturbances in 18- to 30-year-old 
women after COVID-19 vaccination” by Lill Trogstad et al. 2022.  
5.  The MAH should discuss the pathophysiology of heavy menstrual bleeding, and consider if 
there is a biological plausibility that Spikevax could be associated with development of heavy 
menstrual bleeding. 
6.  The MAH should provide an estimation of the number of women of childbearing age that have 
been vaccinated with Spikevax 
The MAH should also discuss the need for any potential amendment to the product information and/or 
the risk management plan and make accordingly a proposal for the changes to the relevant sections 
within this discussion. 
A 60/60 timetable is considered sufficient 
2.4.  Adopted PRAC recommendation 
Having considered the available evidence from national reviews (post marketing cases and published 
studies), the PRAC has agreed that the MAH for COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine Spikevax (Moderna Biotech 
Spain, S.L.) should perform a cumulative review of all cases of heavy menstrual bleeding from all 
sources, including, but not limited to, available data from clinical trials, literature and post marketing 
exposure. The MAH should provide by 7 April 2022 answers to the below List of Questions concerning 
clinical trials, literature, case overview and review, possible mechanism of action and exposure in 
females of childbearing potential. 
1. Clinical trials 
The MAH should provide an overview and clinical evaluation of cases of heavy menstrual bleeding, 
reported during pivotal clinical trials. The clinical evaluation should include age, childbearing potential, 
reported risk factors for heavy menstrual bleeding, concomitant medication, patient medical history 
including previous menstruation pattern, duration of the event and outcome. This information should 
be considered in the context of the total number of females, including of childbearing potential 
participating in the study. 
Signal assessment on heavy menstrual bleeding with COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (Spikevax)  
EMA/PRAC/897385/2022  
Page 9/64 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The MAH should clarify how adverse events related to heavy menstrual bleeding were reported, i.e. if 
these were solicited adverse events or spontaneously reported by the participants.  
2. Published literature 
The MAH should perform a literature review on the possible association between heavy menstrual 
bleeding and COVID-19 mRNA vaccine Spikevax. The literature review should include, but not be 
limited to a discussion on the studies by: Lill Trogstad et al.1 , Nguyen et al.2  and Edelman et al.3 . 
3. Case overview 
The MAH should list the number of reported cases of the preferred term heavy menstrual bleeding 
stratified by: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
worldwide and region   
country in the EU/EEA 
dose number in series 
seriousness 
reporter (medically/non-medically confirmed) 
positive rechallenge. 
4. Case review 
The case review should prioritise serious and/or medically confirmed cases, where information on risk 
factors and medical history is included. Special focus should be given to cases in which the previous 
menstruation pattern is known, and to cases of heavy menstrual bleeding with positive rechallenge.    
The case review should include a WHO-UMC Causality assessment, and a justification of causality 
category should be given for each case. The MAH should provide for all cases a clear breakdown of the 
number of cases that were either supportive of causality/ unsupportive due to presence of other 
causes, risk factors, underlying conditions, confounding medication/ unassessable. 
The following information should be stratified: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Details of medically relevant co-reported adverse events (if any)  
Cases in which women used hormonal contraception (including hormonal intrauterine devices) 
Cases with other types of intrauterine devices  
Cases that received heterologous primary or booster schemes. 
If available, the MAH should provide information on when vaccination took place relating to the time of 
ovulation, the luteal phase and so on, in those ICSRs where the information on the menstrual cycle is 
known and discuss whether a pattern might exist.  
When excluding cases from the review, a justification for doing so should be provided by the MAH. 
Based on a review of case reports with inconclusive causality due to confounding factors and/or lacking 
information, the MAH should provide a nuanced discussion of whether Spikevax may have aggravated 
the condition in cases where causality cannot be firmly established.

5. Mechanism of action 
The MAH should discuss the pathophysiology of heavy menstrual bleeding and whether any biological 
plausibility/mechanism of action exists.  
6. Exposure in females of childbearing potential 
The MAH should provide an estimation of the number of women of childbearing age that have been 
vaccinated with Spikevax. 
The MAH should discuss the need for any potential amendment to the product information and/or the 
risk management plan and make accordingly a proposal for changes to the relevant sections within this 
discussion. The PRAC will assess the cumulative review within a 60 days’ timetable. 
3.  Additional evidence 
On 07 April 2022 the MAH submitted a signal evaluation report and a response to the questions on 
heavy menstrual bleeding, which are summarized below. 
3.1.  Assessment of additional data 
According to the MAH, all information available at the time of the document preparation was included 
in the analysis. The subject of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with the administration of mRNA-
1273 in patients aged 18 years or older was assessed. 
3.1.1.  Review of data on heavy menstrual bleeding 
3.1.1.1.  Question 1: Clinical trials 
The MAH should provide an overview and clinical evaluation of cases of heavy menstrual 
bleeding, reported during pivotal clinical trials. The clinical evaluation should include age, 
childbearing potential, reported risk factors for heavy menstrual bleeding, concomitant 
medication, patient medical history including previous menstruation pattern, duration of the 
event and outcome. This information should be considered in the context of the total 
number of females, including of childbearing potential participating in the study. 
The MAH should clarify how adverse events related to heavy menstrual bleeding were 
reported, i.e. if these were solicited adverse events or spontaneously reported by the 
participants. 
MAH Response: 
The MAH’s database of the phase 3 study NCT04470427 [7] with a data-lock point of 04 May 2021 was 
searched using the MedDRA version 24.0 preferred terms (PTs) “heavy menstrual bleeding”, 
“menometrorrhagia”, and “polymenorrhagia”.  
From the clinical trial data, data lock point of May 4th, 2022, six spontaneously reported treatment-
emergent adverse event of heavy menstrual bleeding were identified; five in the mRNA-1273 arm and 
one in placebo arm, and all had a medical history or use of concomitant medication that provided an

alternate etiology for heavy menstrual bleeding. The median age of the six cases was 41 years, range 
20s-50s years; the adult woman (subject 4) was in active arm and reported post-menopausal 
bleeding. All six cases were considered non-serious. The outcome is described as recovered/resolved in 
four cases (three in the verum group, one in the placebo group) and as ongoing in two cases.

Comment PRAC Co-Rapporteur: 
Concerning search strategy and reporting of AEs from CTs: The MedDRA PT “polymenorrhea” (10036086) 
was not integrated into the search, nor was the more general PT “vaginal hemorrhage” (10046910).  
The  MAH  did  not  explain  how  adverse  events  related  to  heavy  menstrual  bleeding  were  reported 
(solicited/non-solicited reporting). In this signal evaluation report, the MAH does not specify the number 
of female study participants of childbearing age and the length of follow-up of this cohort. Considering 
the disproportionate number of adverse events in the verum versus placebo group, it would be important 
to  take  into  account  the  numbers  of  events  related  to  person  years  (females  of  childbearing  age)  of 
exposure. 
Little  medical  details  have  been  presented  by  the  MAH  concerning  the  clinical  trial  cases  of  heavy 
menstrual bleeding. From Table 1 the following information can be derived: Four of five vaccine case 
reports occurred after the second dose, age range of the vaccine reports between 20s and 50s years of 
age (3 reports ≥ 45 years of age)). TTO varied between 2 days (after 1st dose) and 85 days (2nd dose). 
In  the  case  with  TTO  85  days  following  second  dose  most  likely  two  regular  cycles  followed  the 
vaccination before onset of symptoms. Confounding factors in the trial cases are listed in the table above. 
Thus, according to the very limited information presented, no consistent clinical pattern can be identified 
in CT case reports.

3.1.1.2.  Question 2:  
Published literature 
The MAH should perform a literature review on the possible association between heavy 
menstrual bleeding and COVID-19 mRNA vaccine Spikevax. The literature review should 
include, but not be limited to a discussion on the studies by: Lill Trogstad et al., Nguyen et 
al. and Edelman et al. 
MAH Response:  
A literature search and review was performed using PubMed and Google Scholar databases. Multiple 
search strategies were used to identify articles related to heavy menstrual bleeding and the COVID-19 
pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 infection, and COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, Spikevax. 
Of the 230 unique articles captured, five discussed heavy menstrual bleeding after vaccination with 
Spikevax. Three articles were cross-sectional studies and two presented spontaneous, post- 
authorization data (Netherlands and United States of America). Although the cross-sectional studies 
reported that 20-41% women vaccinated with Spikevax reported heavy menstrual bleeding after 
vaccination, compared to prior menstrual pattern, the studies were limited because they lacked an 
unvaccinated comparator group which is crucial given heavy menstrual bleeding is common; 
additionally, some published studies have indicated that the pandemic itself was associated with 
changes in menstruation. Additionally, the studies were limited due to recall bias, use of unvalidated 
questionnaires and selection bias. The published data currently does not support an association 
between heavy menstrual bleeding and Spikevax. 
Edelman et al.: The authors analyzed prospectively tracked menstrual cycle data using an existing 
menstrual cycle tracking app (Natural Cycles) and included 3,959 individuals (vaccinated 2.403 [35% 
received Spikevax] and unvaccinated 1,556) aged 18-45 years with normal cycle lengths who logged 
at least six consecutive cycles. In the adjusted models, the first dose of vaccine had no effect on 
timing of the subsequent period, while the second dose was associated with a delay of 0.45 days 
(98.75% confidence interval 0.06 to 0.84). Most affected were the 358 individuals who received both 
doses of the vaccine in the same cycle, reporting a 2.32 day (98.75% CI 1.59 to 3.04) delay to their 
next period. In all groups, cycle lengths returned to normal by two cycles after vaccination. The study 
limitations include study population that might not be generalizable to the U.S. population (Natural 
Cycle users are more likely to be White, college educated, not using hormonal contraception and have 
lower BMIs) or individuals whose menstruation is not consistent with normal cycle lengths (e.g., obese 
persons), self-reported data and lack of data on SARS-CoV-2 status of the study population. However, 
the findings are reassuring and did not find any population-level clinically meaningly change in 
menstrual cycle length associated with COVID-19 vaccination. 
Trogstad et al.: The authors analyzed data collected from mobile-phone questionnaire obtained from 
a pre-existing population-based Norwegian Young Adult Cohort of 5688 women aged 18-30 year. They 
were asked whether they had experienced specific menstrual changes (such as unexpected 
breakthrough bleeding or worse than normal period pain) in the cycles before and after each vaccine 
dose. The prevalence of any menstrual disturbance was 37.8% prior to vaccination, highlighting the 
high level of variation in normal cycles. The study identified heavier than normal bleeding as the 
change most associated with vaccination (first dose: relative risk 1.9, 95% confidence interval 1.69 to

2.13; second dose:1.84, 1.66 to 2.03). The study limitations include lack of an unvaccinated 
comparator group, recall bias, and use of unvalidated questionnaire. Although, this study found an 
increase in heavier bleeding after vaccination, it also showed that menstrual disturbances are generally 
common regardless of vaccination. 
Nguyen et al.: The authors analyzed menstrual cycle data using an existing menstrual cycle tracking 
app (Natural Cycles) and included 18,076 individuals accounting for 214,426 cycles. Data from March-
September 2019 (pre-pandemic) to March-September 2020 (during pandemic) were compared to 
determine difference in proportion of users experiencing menstrual changes. 45.4% of the app users 
reported more pandemic-related stress. Changes in average cycle and menstruation lengths were not 
clinically significant, remaining at 29 and 4 days, respectively. The authors concluded that the COVID-
19 pandemic did not induce population-level changes to ovulation and menstruation among women 
using a mobile app to track menstrual cycles and predict ovulation. The study limitations include self-
reported data, recall bias, and potential limited generalizability of results given their study population 
(well-educated women over age of 30, from high income countries). 
The MAH briefly described 5 articles on Spikevax and heavy menstrual bleeding (Table 2) and 4 articles 
on SARS-CoV-2 infection and heavy menstrual bleeding

PRAC Co-Rapporteur Assessment Comment  
The MAH identified five literature articles describing heavy menstrual bleeding after vaccination 
with Spikevax, three cross-sectional studies and two reviews of spontaneous reports post-
marketing (Netherlands and United States of America). The articles themselves are not discussed 
in detail; the studies of Edelman et al. Trogstad et al, and Nguyen et al. are briefly summarized. 
(Of these three studies only the study by Trogstad et al has investigated heavy menstrual 
bleeding). The MAH emphasizes the frequency of heavy menstrual bleeding in general and 
limitations of the studies, such as the lack of an unvaccinated comparison group, changes in the 
menstrual cycle due to the pandemic itself, recall and selection bias. Thus, the critical assessment 
of the studies is limited to a few general comments. There is no in-depth analysis of individual 
studies, their methodology, conclusions and limitations. 
Edelman et al.: According to authors “no population-level clinically meaningful change in menstrual 
cycle length” following a vaccination against Covid-19 was identified in this study. The menses 
length was not affected by the vaccination. The authors prospectively tracked menstrual cycle data 
using the application “Natural Cycles”. U.S. residents aged 18–45 years with normal cycle lengths 
were evaluated for three consecutive cycles before the first vaccine dose followed by vaccine-dose 
cycles (cycles 4–6). An unvaccinated group was also evaluated.  The study results are reassuring 
based on the observed less than 1 day change in cycle length after first and second dose of a 
COVID-19 vaccine (35 % of participant vaccinated with Spikevax). The study however did not 
investigate menstrual symptoms, unscheduled bleeding, and the quality and quantity of menstrual 
bleeding. 835 (34.7%) of the 2,403 vaccinated individuals had received Spikevax.

Nguyen et al.: Prospective data from a cycle-tracking app before and during the Covid-19 
pandemic were analyzed. Vaccines against Covid-19 were not yet approved during the periods 
studied. The authors found that COVID-19 vaccination is associated with a small not meaningful 
change in cycle length but not menses length. The authors did not study other menstrual disorders 
such as such as menstrual symptoms, unscheduled bleeding, and changes in the quality and 
quantity of menstrual bleeding. Whether the study population and App user are representative for 
the female US population at childbearing age is questionable.  
Trogstad et al. [preprint]: The authors investigated in a retrospective survey a large cohort of 
young females and found an increase in heavier bleeding than usual (relative risk, first vaccine 
dose, 1.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.69-2.13; second vaccine dose, 1.84, 95% CI 1.66-2.03) 
and other menstrual disturbances.  Menstrual disturbances were generally common regardless of 
vaccination (37.8% prior to vaccination). Spikevax had been given to 2,020 (35.5%) of the 5,688 
study participants as the first vaccine dose, and to 2,736 (48.1%) as the second vaccine dose. The 
limitations of the study are briefly described by the MAH and endorsed by the assessor. The 
retrospective nature, the use of a non-validated questionnaire and the response rate of 68.4% of 
contacted females may have introduced biases. 
Lee et al [preprint]: In this study 42% of people with regular menstrual cycles bleed more heavily 
than usual (note: nearly a third of this subgroup also experienced a longer duration of menstrual 
bleeding), while 44% reported no change, after being vaccinated. The authors found increased 
bleeding was significantly associated with age, other vaccine side effects (fever, fatigue), history of 
pregnancy or birth, and ethnicity. The authors classified self-reported bleeding after vaccination in 
three categories (“heavier”, “no change in flow”, “not heavier” which is a combination of no change 
and lighter bleeding flow). The study is based on an online survey, which was announced via 
Twitter and other social media (“extensive snowball sampling via many channels”). The analysed 
data represents the download of reported data in a time interval of 12 weeks. The study is prone to 
multiple biases (e.g. recall bias) as outlined by the MAH. Benevolently, the study could be 
hypothesis generating.  
Male [preprint]: The survey did not provide a signal that vaccination against Covid-19 is associated 
with menstrual changes. (10.7%) of the 1273 retrospectively recruited participants reported having 
been vaccinated with Spikevax.  
The Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb: Overall reporting rates for heavy menstrual 
blood loss following vaccination with Spikevax were 51.4 per 100,000 first vaccinations and 62.5 
per 100,000 second vaccinations. 
Zhang et al. [preprint]: The authors analysed spontaneous reports of menstrual disorders in the 
Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Most reports after vaccination against Covid-19 
(4,626 of 13,118 reports, corresponding to 35.3%) involved the MedDRA term “menstruation 
irregular”; less frequently reported were “metrorrhagia” (1,671 reports, corresponding to 12.7%), 
“menorrhagia” (28 reports, corresponding to 0.2%), and “intermenstrual bleeding” (2,088 reports, 
corresponding to 15.9%). 2,748 reports concerned Spikevax. 
Alvergne et al. [preprint]: The authors describe menstrual irregularities in 20% of 4,989 vaccinated 
individuals. As far as known, the participants had not been vaccinated with Spikevax. 
Other papers published after 15 February 2022 describe menstrual changes following a vaccination 
against Covid-19. In the article by Muhaidat et al., 66.3% of 2,269 women reported mostly within 
two months self-limiting changes in their menstruation, predominantly after the first dose 
(menorrhagia, 8.9%; prolonged duration of menstruation, 8.5%; intermenstrual bleeding, 1.1%).

(Spikevax)

35.3% of the participants already experienced menstrual abnormalities during the Covid-19 
pandemic before vaccination. Only 16 females (0.7%) had been vaccinated with Spikevax. In 
contrast, the survey of 164 women (19 with a first dose of Spikevax, 14 with a second dose of 
Spikevax) by Laganà et al showed a slightly higher proportion of menstrual abnormalities after the 
second vaccine dose. This study describes the occurrence of menstrual irregularities in 50-60% of 
the participants (regardless of the type of administered vaccine), mainly anticipated, longer, and 
heavier menstrual cycles than expected and usual. The study has several limitations in addition to 
the limited sample size such as self-administration of a customised questionnaire, without previous 
validation and high potential for recall bias (study announced via social media). 
In summary, studies investigating potential heavy menstrual bleeding following Spikevax 
vaccination have serious limitations and do not provide robust evidence that Spikevax is associated 
with heavy menstrual bleeding. 
3.1.1.3.  Question 3: 
The MAH should list the number of reported cases of the preferred term heavy menstrual 
bleeding stratified by: worldwide and region, country in the EU/EEA, dose number in 
series, seriousness, reporter (medically/non-medically confirmed), positive rechallenge. 
MAH Response:  
Cases by Worldwide and Region: 60.0% of cases reported are from the European Economic 
Area, with only 9.9% of cases reported from the United States.

Events by Dose and Time to Onset: 39% of events with missing dose, 31% of events occurred 
after first dose and 24% after second dose and 7% after the third dose. There was no unusual 
pattern and clustering seen regarding dose (keeping in mind that more dose 1 vaccines have been 
administered compared to dose 2 and dose 3) and time to onset. However, it is very difficult to 
interpret the TTO without putting it into context of the menstrual cycle

Cases by reporter: 13.7% of cases were reported by health care professional and majority of the 
cases (86.4) were reported as Not Medically Confirmed. 
Re-challenge: The 1,247 cases (serious cases and medically confirmed cases) were medically 
reviewed and no cases of positive rechallenge were identified. 
PRAC  Co-Rapporteur  Assessment  Comment:  The  MAH  provided  the  requested  information.  The 
MAH’s safety database with a data-lock point of 15 February 2022 was queried using the MedDRA 
version  24.1  preferred  terms  (PTs)  “heavy  menstrual  bleeding”,  “menometrorrhagia”,  and 
“polymenorrhagia” as of 15 February 2022. This search returned 4,000 cases with 4,309 events. 998 
cases or 846 events were serious, and 546 cases (13.7%) were medically confirmed.

Notably, there is a disproportional share in some EEA countries and UK compared USA, Ca, Australia.  
Even in case reports with dose number unknown, information on the TTO may be available. Table 6 
does not provide any data in this regard. 
3.1.1.4.  Question 4: 
Case review 
The case review should prioritise serious and/or medically confirmed cases, where 
information on risk factors and medical history is included. Special focus should be given 
to cases in which the previous menstruation pattern is known, and to cases of heavy 
menstrual bleeding with positive re-challenge. 
The case review should include a WHO-UMC Causality assessment, and a justification of 
causality category should be given for each case. The MAH should provide for all cases a 
clear breakdown of the number of cases that were either supportive of causality/ 
unsupportive due to presence of other causes, risk factors, underlying conditions, 
confounding medication/ unassessable. 
The following information should be stratified: 
•  Details of medically relevant co-reported adverse events (if any) 
•  Cases in which women used hormonal contraception (including hormonal 
intrauterine devices) 
•  Cases with other types of intrauterine devices 
•  Cases that received heterologous primary or booster schemes. 
• 
If available, the MAH should provide information on when vaccination took place 
relating to the time of ovulation, the luteal phase and so on, in those ICSRs where 
the information on the menstrual cycle is known and discuss whether a pattern 
might exist. 
•  When excluding cases from the review, a justification for doing so should be 
provided by the MAH. 
•  Based on a review of case reports with inconclusive causality due to confounding 
factors and/or lacking information, the MAH should provide a nuanced discussion 
of whether Spikevax may have aggravated the condition in cases where causality 
cannot be firmly established. 
MAH Response:  
Post marketing data for heavy menstrual bleeding events were retrieved from the Company safety 
database using the following three MedDRA preferred term: Heavy menstrual bleeding’, 
‘Menometrorrhagia’, and ‘Polymenorrhagia’ with a data-lock point (DLP) of 15 February 2022, using 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 24.1. 4000 cases were identified, and 
all the serious cases not medically confirmed (701) and medically confirmed cases (546) were 
reviewed.

The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics-Abnormal Uterine Bleeding case 
definition for heavy menstrual bleeding was used. (Heavy menstrual bleeding is defined as a 
volume that interferes with the patient's physical, social, emotional, and/or material quality of life). 
The World Health Organization- Uppsala Monitoring Centre (WHO-UMC) system was used for 
causality assessment. 
The MAH identified 14 cases with date of vaccination and onset, known previous menstruation 
pattern. The median age of the 14 cases was 38.5 years (range: 21-50), 21% (3/14) received 
heterologous boosters (Pfizer BioNTech vaccine for their primary series), 43% (6/14) reported use 
of hormonal contraception including Mirena IUD and Nexplanon. There was no unusual pattern or 
clustering by dose and time to onset as well as time of vaccination during menstrual cycle. Seven 
of the 14 cases were spontaneously cycling and timing of vaccination during the menstrual cycle 
occurred at various points throughout the menstrual cycle (Day 2, Day 5, Day 6, Day 14, Day 21, 
Day 23, and Day 25); In these 14 cases no timing according to the menstrual cycle (Menstrual 
phase, Proliferative phase Ovulatory phase; Luteal phase) was observed.  Based on the WHO-
UMC system all 14 cases were possibly related due to temporal association, however 71% of them 
had medical conditions or concomitant medications (including age ≥ 45 years, obesity, postpartum 
status, h/o breast cancer, hypothyroidism, and inflammatory bowel syndrome) that provided an 
alternate aetiology. 
According to the MAH this review highlighted the challenges with using spontaneous data to explore 
this  topic  which  includes  the  high  level  of  missing  data  (e.g.,  menstrual  history,  medical  history, 
concomitant medications, clinical course including testing and duration) with spontaneous reports. 
PRAC Co-Rapporteur Assessment Comment: The MAH identified 14 cases with date of vaccination 
and onset, known previous menstruation pattern. Interestingly, half of the case reports 
experienced heavy menstrual bleeding flowing the third dose (dose 1 n=4 case reports, dose 2 
n=3, dose 3 n=7).  
Although, it is acknowledged that spontaneous reports frequently lack important clinical 
information, it appears somewhat astonishing that only in 14 out of 4000 reports relevant 
information concerning vaccination and onset date and previous menstruation pattern were 
available. The MAH apparently did not analyse cases of positive re-challenge (app. 100 cases in 
No). Examples of a positive re-challenge had been given by the Norwegian Medicines Agency One 
of them is a medically-confirmed case report. Thus, a review of case reports with positive re-
challenge (positive re-challenge may not only be detected by searching the E2B field but may be 
mentioned in the narrative) would have been useful.  
Observed to Expected Analyses 
The MAH presented an observed versus expected analysis. The MAH estimated the Spikevax doses 
administered based on the following information: US CDC, ECDC, Health Canada, the Swiss Federal 
Office of Public Health and Our World in Data ( (data retrieved on 16th February 2022). 
Using the overall age and gender distribution of all vaccinees in the US (Comirnaty, Spikevax, 
Janssen, and AstraZeneca) as reported by CDC (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data- 
tracker/#vaccination-demographic), the age and gender distribution for Spikevax was mirrored. 
Further, the number of Spikevax recipients were capped at 3% for <18 years of age as majority of 
vaccinees <18 years received Comirnaty. The total number of <18 years SPIKEVAX vaccines were 
further divided in <12 and 12-17 years using ratio of 0.05:0.95. These ratios were based on the 
Signal assessment on heavy menstrual bleeding with COVID-19 mRNA vaccine 
(Spikevax)  
EMA/PRAC/897385/2022

proportion of reports in the safety database. To estimate, the number of female Spikevax vaccines 
from 15-17 years of, number of female vaccines 12-17 years were divided in 12-14 and 15 – 17 
years using ratio of 0.25:0.75. These ratios were based on the proportion of reports in the safety 
database. 
To calculate the person-years for 21-day risk window, the total number of doses administered were 
multiplied by 21 and dividing by 365.25. To obtain the age and genders stratified 21-day risk 
window person-years the US age and gender distribution of SPIKEVAX was mirrored. 
The observed to expected analysis for menstrual disorders included observed cases of heavy 
menstrual bleeding (heavy menstrual bleeding, menometrorrhagia, and polymenorrhagia) and 
amenorrhea (amenorrhea, delayed menarche, and premature menopause). For this analysis only 
cases with known female gender were included. 
Stahlman et al. has characterized the incidence in menorrhagia in active service women, US Armed 
Forces from 2012-2016. The incidence rate was similar to the incidence of heavy menstrual 
bleeding in general practice in Netherlands (2004 -2013). 
The cumulative number of cases with heavy menstrual bleeding were 3940 (reporting rate of 0.12 
per 100 person-years). These were less compared to the expected number of cases (N = 36,1230 
with reporting rate of 10.09 per 100 person-years). The overall and the age-specific rate ratio was 
lower than 0.05 (Table below). The sensitivity analysis (assuming 25% and 50% capture of the 
observed cases) does not change the interpretation. In conclusion, the observed rates of heavy 
menstrual bleeding were lower than expected background rates.

PRAC Co- Rapporteur Assessment Comment: 
The OvE calculations presented by the MAH are not correct. The incidence rates in the cited paper 
by Stahlman et al. for menorrhagia (2012 to 2016 service women armed US forces) are one tenth 
of the incidence rates used for the analyses of the present signal evaluation report, 100.9 per 10,000 
person-years  correspond  to  1.009  per  100  person-years,  not  10.9,  etc.  However,  even  with  the 
correct background incidence rates, OvE would not exceed 1 according to the calculation of the MAH. 
Notably is also a decline of the incidence from 2012 to 2016.  
Otherwise, the incidence rate in the manuscript of Stahlman et al. is similar to that reported in a 
retrospective Dutch study, which found a mean incidence rate of 9.3 per 1,000 person-years (95% 
confidence  interval  8.5-10.2)  for  heavy  menstrual  bleeding,  with  the  highest  incidence  rates  for 
women aged 35-54 years.  
Limitations of the OvE analysis need to be acknowledged. Menstrual disorders are generally common, 
however they do not always result in a presentation to healthcare professionals (electronic health 
care data were used to calculate the incidence in the Stahlman publication). This would result in an 
underestimation  of  menorrhagia  background  incidence.  There  are  a  number  of  assumptions 
concerning age and sex stratified exposure for which the impact on the results of the OvE analysis 
are unclear.  
Not all spontaneous reports are likely to meet the criteria of the (much stricter) case definition of 
background incidence (used by the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center (AFHSC). In addition, 
as  menstrual  disturbances  are  usually  common  and  a  high  proportion  of  female  may  experience 
menstrual  disturbances  at  some  time,  underreporting  after  vaccination  is  expected.  Whether  the 
unknown  underreporting  rate  and  back-log  of  reporting  (90  day  reporting  requirements  for  non-
serious  case  reports  of  NCAs)  is  adequately  addressed  in  the  sensitivity  analysis  of  potential 
underreporting conducted by the MAH is unclear.  
In conclusion, the number of reports of heavy menstrual bleeding following Spikevax vaccination is 
lower  than  the  expected  number,  although  important  limitations  of  the  OvE  analysis  need  to  be 
considered.  The  result  of  the  OvE  analysis  presented  by  the  MAH  do  not  suggest  a  link  between 
changes to menstrual periods and Spikevax.  
The  MAH  has  also  presented  in the  separate  signal report disproportionality  analyses.  VAERS  and 
EVDAS were queried with regard to the PTs mentioned above, yielding an EB05 of 0.777 (VAERS) 
and a ROR of 3.68 (EVDAS) for “heavy menstrual bleeding”, an EB05 of 0.687 and a ROR of 1.94 for 
“menometrorrhagia”, and an EB05 of 0.383 and a ROR of 1.22 for “polymenorrhagia”. These analyses 
may reflect the uneven reporting rate in the USA and EEA.  
Other copy and paste errors are also note in the response document (mentioning amenorrhea instead 
of heavy menstrual bleeding). 
3.1.1.5.  Question 5  
Mechanism of action 
The MAH should discuss the pathophysiology of heavy menstrual bleeding and whether 
any biological plausibility/ mechanism of action exists. 
Signal assessment on heavy menstrual bleeding with COVID-19 mRNA vaccine 
(Spikevax)  
EMA/PRAC/897385/2022  
Page 24/64 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Response of MAH:  
The basic biology of the menstrual cycle is a complex, coordinated sequence of events involving the 
hypothalamus, anterior pituitary, ovary, and endometrium. Heavy menstrual bleeding in a female 
of reproductive age is related to the disturbance of normal hormonal, physiological mechanism, or 
female anatomic abnormalities. The normal physiological mechanism works by balancing hormones 
and providing feedback between the hypothalamus, pituitary, ovaries, and uterus. Physiologically, 
menstruation is controlled by the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the 
hypothalamus, and it works on the pituitary to release follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and 
luteinizing hormone (LH) and these two hormones from the pituitary act on ovaries and ovaries 
finally make estrogen and progesterone to work on the uterus to carry out the follicular and 
secretory phase of the menstrual cycle. 
The causes of heavy menstrual bleeding are numerous and often unknown; any process that 
interferes with the normal endocrine, paracrine or hemostatic functions of the endometrium as well 
as possibly any interference with myometrial contractility may cause heavy menstrual bleeding. 
According to the Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics classification of abnormal uterine 
bleeding AUB, nine categories are listed according to the acronym PALM-COEIN. The PALM (polyp, 
adenomyosis, leiomyoma, and malignancy) group consists of structural abnormalities that can be 
visualized using imaging techniques or diagnosed by histopathology; whereas nonstructural 
disorders that cannot be imaged or diagnosed with histopathology are included in the COEIN 
(coagulopathy, ovulatory dysfunction, endometrial, iatrogenic including medication and not yet 
classified) group. 
To date, the evidence is insufficient to demonstrate association between menstrual disorder and 
vaccination. The relationship between heavy menstrual bleeding and Spikevax is unclear. Some 
proposed hypothetical biological mechanisms include the ACE2 receptors have been found on 
ovarian and endometrial tissue and hence vaccination may hypothetically affect ovarian hormone 
production and/or the endometrial response at menses, alterations in coagulation system, which is 
a critical component of endometrial function at menstruation, and possible endometrial 
inflammatory response mediated by immune cells in the lining of uterus. 
PRAC Co-Rapporteur Assessment Comment: Abnormal uterine bleeding in women of reproductive 
age is a manifestation of a number of disorders or pathologic entities. The MAH gives an overview 
of the topic of heavy menstrual bleeding and refers to the FIGO classification of causes underlying 
an abnormal uterine bleeding (PALM-COEIN). The complexity of various causes of heavy menstrual 
bleeding highlights the importance collecting information concerning the menstrual cycle in a 
subject, previous menstrual disorders, medical history and concomitant medication as well as other 
confounding factors when assessing individual case reports. The various causes of heavy menstrual 
bleeding should also be considered when designing a study. In this respect, cross-sectional studies 
based on self-reported changes are not suitable to adequately investigate the issue. 
The discussion of possible pathomechanisms of heavy menstrual bleeding and mRNA vaccination is 
very brief and does not address potential biological mechanisms other than ACE2 receptor presence 
in the endometrium and ovarian tissue, e.g. more general inflammatory vaccine response.

3.1.1.6.  Question 6: 
Exposure in females of childbearing potential 
The MAH should provide an estimation of the number of women of childbearing age that 
have been vaccinated with Spikevax. 
MAH Response: 
Estimation of exposure of Spikevax in women of childbearing potential. Spikevax supply chain 
estimates are used to define the number of doses SPIKEVAX distributed by country; however, 
administration data are tracked by health officials within countries receiving the vaccine. Therefore, 
Moderna estimates administration of SPIKEVAX based on information retrieved through the US 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid- data- 
tracker/#vaccinations), the European Centres for Disease Control 
(https://qap.ecdc.europa.eu/public/extensions/COVID-19/vaccine-tracker.html#distribution-tab), 
Health Canada (https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/), the Swiss 
Federal Office of Public Health (https://www.covid19.admin.ch/en/epidemiologic/vacc-doses), and 
Our World in Data (https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations) (data retrieved on 16th February 
2022). 
Using the overall age and gender distribution of all vaccinees in the US (Comirnaty, Spikevax, 
Janssen, and AstraZeneca) as reported by CDC (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data- 
tracker/#vaccination-demographic), the age and gender distribution for Spikevax was mirrored. 
Further, the number of Spikevax recipients were capped at 3% for <18 years of age as majority of 
vaccinees <18 years received Comirnaty. The total number of <18 years Spikevax vaccines were 
further divided in <12 and 12-17 years using ratio of 0.05:0.95. These ratios were based on the 
proportion of reports in the safety database. To estimate, the number of female Spikevax vaccinees 
from 15 -17 years of, number of female vaccines 12-17 years were divided in 12-14 and 15 – 17 
years using ratio of 0.25:0.75. These ratios were based on the proportion of reports in the safety 
database.  
World health organization (WHO) defines the women of reproductive age as women between 15 
and 49 years of age. Based on the estimated age and gender specific estimations of Spikevax 
administration, globally total number of women of childbearing potential with exposure of Spikevax 
was 63,645,605 (as of 16th Feb 2022). The age distribution is shown in Table 8.

PRAC Co-Rapporteurs Assessment Comment: The exposure calculation in general is endorsed. The 
impact of the extrapolation from age and gender distribution from the USA to EEA and UK

(Vaxzevria exposure in the EEA and UK is apparently higher, COVID-19 vaccine Janssen apparently 
lower) is unclear.  
3.1.1.7.  Conclusion of the MAH 
Although there have been reports of heavy menstrual bleeding after vaccination, it is important to 
note that normal variations exist within women over the lifespan and menstrual disturbances are 
common. Additionally, menstrual cycle features (such as bleeding volume) are subjective, not 
standardized, and collected by self-report which can introduce multiple biases including 
misclassification. The studies identified are not able to determine the frequency with which people 
experience heavy menstrual bleeding following Spikevax or determine whether there is a link 
between Spikevax and heavy menstrual bleeding; studies were limited due to lack of unvaccinated 
control group, recruitment of participants retrospectively, use of unvalidated questionnaires, 
selection and recall bias. 
Despite the limitations, findings from these studies were reassuring, the reported changes were 
small compared to natural variation and quickly reverse. Last there is no clear biological plausibility 
linking Spikevax and heavy menstrual bleeding; all cases reviewed (clinical trial and post-
marketing data) were only temporally associated with Spikevax and a vast majority of them had 
medical conditions or were on concomitant medications that provided alternate etiologies. 
Thus, based on the analysis of all available safety data as of 15 February 2022, the MAH considers 
that there is insufficient information to establish a causal relationship between the administration of 
Spikevax and the development of heavy menstrual bleeding. No new or emerging safety issue of 
concern was identified. This health authority validated signal is refuted (refer to Appendix C for the 
SER) and no change to the reference safety information, labeling or risk management plan is 
required. The MAH will continue to monitor events for heavy menstrual bleeding through routine 
pharmacovigilance activities. 
3.2.  Rapporteur’s proposed recommendation 
Heavy menstrual bleeding is common according to the literature. The number of spontaneous 
reports of heavy menstrual bleeding is lower than what would be expected. Notably, the number of 
cases reported after vaccination with Spikevax in different countries varies widely. Assessment of 
individual case safety reports post-marketing is challenging considering the lack of important 
clinical information. Unfortunately, the MAH has not analyzed cases of positive re-challenge.  
Five cases of heavy menstrual bleeding have been reported in clinical trials in the vaccine group. 
Although only very brief clinical information have been presented, confounding factors and 
alternative etiologies have been identified in these reports. 
The quality of the published non-interventional studies, which obtained mixed results, have a 
number of methodological limitations.  
No potential pathomechanism has been identified. 
The available data is not sufficient to conclude on a reasonable causal relationship between 
vaccination and heavy menstrual bleeding nor on the potential pathomechanism. 
Many women across the world after receiving mRNA COVID vaccines are complaining of 
irregularities in their menstrual bleeding; some experiencing heavy menstrual bleeding. Thus, 
Signal assessment on heavy menstrual bleeding with COVID-19 mRNA vaccine 
(Spikevax)  
EMA/PRAC/897385/2022  
Page 27/64 
 
 
 
 
 
 
robust research is needed to further investigate this issue. Clinical trials provide the ideal setting in 
which to differentiate between menstrual changes caused by interventions from those that occur by 
chance. Therefore, the MAH is asked to further explore whether this issue may be investigated in 
subsequent or ongoing clinical trials. For the time being there is no need to change the product 
information.  
List of Questions: 
The MAH is asked to present an assessment of reports of positive re-challenge considering 
information on potential confounding factors. 
The MAH is kindly asked to explore the possibility in further investigate the issue of heavy

3.4.  Comments from other PRAC members and MAH(s) 
Comment MS1: 
The  PRAC  co-rapporteur’s  conclusions  are  endorsed.  However,  the  PRAC  rapporteur  has  some 
additional comments regarding the proposed recommendation. Please see below: 
From the proposed recommendation it is not entirely clear how (procedure wise) or when the MAH’s 
response to the LoQ should be assessed. Additionally, experience from various previous procedures 
has shown that the more specific the request, the higher the likelihood of an acceptable response. 
With regard to the request on positive rechallenge proposed by the co-rapporteur, the MAH states 
that “The 1,247 cases (serious cases and medically confirmed cases) were medically reviewed and 
no  cases  of  positive  rechallenge  were  identified.”  It  is  unclear  how  the  MAH  has  reached  this 
conclusion as rechallenge cases have indeed been identified in section 2.1. It is suggested to specify 
the requests as follows: 
1. 
The MAH is kindly asked to explore the possibility of further investigating the issue of 
heavy menstrual bleeding in ongoing or subsequent studies (e.g. clinical trials). The MAH 
should outline which possibilities have been explored. 
2. 
The MAH should provide the following information not included in the response: 
i. 
ii. 
An  explanation  how  adverse  events  related  to  heavy  menstrual  bleeding  were 
reported (solicited/non-solicited reporting). 
A  specification  of  the  number  of  female  study  participants  of  childbearing  age 
and the length of follow-up of this cohort. 
3. 
4. 
The MAH is asked to clarify how the conclusion regarding number of re-challenge cases 
in response to ITEM 3 was reached.  
The MAH is asked to perform a new evaluation of cases with the aim to identify possible 
re-challenge cases. If re-challenge cases are identified, an assessment of these should 
be provided. During assessment, information on potential confounding factors should be 
considered. 
The PRAC Rapporteur proposes that the responses to the LoQ should be assessed in the next PSUR. 
PRAC Co-Rapporteur Comment: The questions of MS1 are endorsed.  
As  pointed out  in  the  preliminary  assessment  report  we assessor  was  wondering  why  positive  re-
challenge ICSRs were not detected by the MAH. By further reviewing this issue, we realized that in 
several ICSRs this information may only be available in the narrative, but not in the structured field 
for  re-challenge.  The  MAH  is  therefore  kindly  asked  to  consider  all  available  ICSR  information  for 
identifying re-challenge cases.

Comment MS2: 
The  conclusion  of  assessment  of  the  MAH,  that  is  endorsed  by  Rapporteur,  is  that  the  available 
evidence  is  insufficient  to  establish  a  causal  relationship  between  heavy  menstrual  bleeding  and 
Spikevax. We do not agree with this assessment and believe that there are some issues that need 
to be discussed properly before a final conclusion can be made.  
The  character  of  menstrual  disorders  should  be  taken  into  consideration.  There  are  mainly  non-
serious cases with short-term duration and mainly self-evaluation and patient self-reporting. We are 
aware, that patient´s reporting is not ideal for demonstrating causal relationship, however because 
of the character of menstrual disorders we believe that higher portion of medically confirmed cases 
cannot be expected (even less after awareness of this issues in future). Majority of women do not 
visit their gynaecologist due to transient menstrual disorder only. This will probably never change 
and therefore, waiting for better HCPs reported cases could mean that we never could conclude on 
this signal. In this case, predominant patients´ reports should not be a reason for rejection of this 
problem.  Moreover,  in  accordance  with  pharmacovigilance  legislation, the patient  cases  should  be 
taken into account during the assessment. The role of patient cases is significantly more important 
in situations, where causal relationship cannot be established based on the confirmed cases because 
of the nature of condition. Moreover, medical confirmation of heavy menstrual bleeding in fact will 
not increase credibility of patients´reports – in this situation the physician can only confirm what the 
woman told him. 
Ad Q1: The review of clinical trial data identified 5 cases of heavy menstrual bleeding in active arm 
vs.  1  case  from  placebo  arm.  Despite  stated  medical  history  and  concomitant  medications  in  the 
provided table of these cases it is not clear how the causality with the vaccination of Spikevax was 
assessed.  However,  2  of  5  cases  of  heavy  menstrual  bleeding  in  active  arm  were  described  as 
“related” vs. 0 “related” cases in placebo arm. Moreover, as the Rapporteur highlighted, the MAH did 
not mention the number of female participants of childbearing age and length of FU of these reports. 
The  MAH  did  not  discuss  even  the  numerical  imbalance  of  the  clinical  trials  and  its  statistical 
significance. There is too little information presented by the MAH that no conclusion can be made 
from  the  clinical  data  but it  aroused  reasonable  suspicion  of  possible  causal  relationship  of  heavy 
menstrual bleeding and Spikevax vaccine. The MAH should provide the missing information regarding 
the clinical data, elucidate all the questions and make the proper assessment with critical discussion. 
Ad Q2: We do not agree with the conclusion of the MAH that the presented studies are not able to 
determine  the  frequency  with  which  the  women  experienced  heavy  menstrual  bleeding  after  the 
Spikevax  vaccination  or  to  determine  whether  there  is  a  link  between  vaccination  and  heavy 
menstrual bleeding. The MAH constantly rejects the findings of all studies because of study limitations 
such as unvalidated questionnaire, recall bias or selection bias but did not provide detailed review 
and discussion of methodology of the mentioned studies. We are of the opinion that the findings from 
the literature could not be trivialised, and the results should be critically discussed and taken into 
consideration.  
The study of Trogstad et al. (preprint) is focusing on number of menstrual disorders. For reduction 
of bias of awareness at the menstrual disorders, the questionnaire included several topics not related 
to menstruation to be answered prior to the questions of menstrual disorders. This study assessed 
5,688 Norwegian women aged 18-30 year and the data of individuals before and after vaccination 
was compared. The self-control case series design is described as a suitable design for investigation 
of vaccines. The bias between a case and a control caused by inter-individual differences is minimized

(Spikevax)

using this type of study. Currently, when the exposure to vaccines is high in a general population, it 
could  be  expected  that  the  populations  of  vaccinated  and  unvaccinated  women  are  considerably 
different, and comparison of these groups could be less suitable. The selection bias is minimized by 
random assorting of women from another ongoing population study. Therefore, inclusion of women 
was  not  driven  by  the  existing  menstrual  disorders  following  vaccination.  The  recall  bias  was 
significantly  solved  by  the  app  which  was  used  by  almost  60%  of  women.  Specifically  for  the 
Spikevax, the study identified heavier menstrual bleeding after first dose of Spikevax with relative 
risk 1.86 (95% CI 1.54 to 2.26) and after second dose of Spikevax with relative risk 1.92 (1.67 to 
2.21).  
The MAH stated that menstrual disturbance was common resulting in 37.8 % prior to the vaccination 
(Trogstad  et  al.).  However,  it  should  be  highlighted  that  this  number  includes  any  menstrual 
disturbance and not only heavy menstrual bleeding. This number (37.8 %) should not be compared 
with the other findings such as significant risks of heavier menstrual bleeding after first and second 
dose of vaccines that are very specific. Overall, the prevalence of the heavy menstrual bleeding (as 
a  single  observed  issue)  was  only  7.6  %  (and  not  the  37.8  %)  prior  to  first  dose  of  COVID-19 
vaccination in comparison with 13.6 % in the first cycle after COVID-19 vaccination and similarly 8.2 
% prior to second dose of COVID-19 vaccination in comparison with 15.3 % after second dose of 
COVID-19 vaccination.  
Similarly in study by Lee et al. (2022) and specifically for Spikevax vaccine, among women with the 
spontaneous regular menstrual cycles and no diagnosed reproductive conditions, 42.5 % (from 3499 
participants) experienced heavier bleeding after vaccination and 44.5 % experienced no change in 
their bleeding heaviness. Women using hormonal contraceptives who report regular menstrual cycles 
and no diagnosed reproductive conditions reported similar trends, 42.5 % (from 1251 participants) 
experienced heavier bleeding after vaccination and 42.5 % experienced no change in their bleeding 
heaviness. The percentages of participants with heavier menstrual bleeding after Spikevax vaccine 
administration was even slightly higher than those for Pfizer. There was no significant difference in 
post-vaccination menstrual flow between Pfizer and Moderna in any of the subgroups.  
The  study  of  Laganà  et  al.  (2022)  showed  significant  increase  of  menstrual  abnormalities  after 
COVID-19 vaccination regardless of the type of vaccine; these reactions had 50 – 60 % of participants 
after first dose and even higher proportion after second dose of vaccination. It is agreed that the 
sample size is small, but still accepted in clinical studies. We would like to kindly disagree to some 
mentioned study limitations by Rapporteur; the questionnaire was designed to be self-administered 
which  could  be  accepted  in  this  kind  of  issue  including  mostly  non-serious  cases  of  menstrual 
disorders when the patients do not need to visit a physician. The questionnaire was self-administrated 
only  one  time  per  respondent  and  the  survey  was  available  only  for  30  days  from  10/9/2021  to 
10/10/2021. The questionnaire was distributed by social media (LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter) which 
are  currently  used  instruments  to  spread  the  questionnaire  to  the  whole  country  and  to  the 
appropriate  age  groups.  It  should  be  also  noted  that  the  questionnaire  consisting  of  26  multiple-
choice questions where the first 13 items aimed to age, BMI, concurrent gynaecological and non-
gynaecological  disorders,  use  of  hormonal  and  non-hormonal  treatments,  number  of  previous 
pregnancies and abortions, reproductive or (peri)menopausal status and type of covid-19 vaccine; 
items 14-16 assessed the frequency, length and quantity of the menstrual cycles before first dose of 
vaccine, items 17-21 assessed the phase of the menstrual cycle in which the first dose of the covid-
19 vaccine was administered, the frequency, length and quantity of the menstrual cycle after the 
administration  and  how  long  this  effect  lasted  in  case  of  menstrual  cycle  irregularities  and/or 
abnormal  menstrual  bleeding;  the  last  items  22-26  assessed  the  phase  of  the  menstrual  cycle  in 
which  the  second  dose  of  the  covid-19  vaccine  was  administered.  Of  note,  to  avoid  the  potential

(Spikevax)

Page 32/64 
 
 
 
 
 
biases,  the  authors  excluded  women  with  gynaecological  and  non-gynaecological  disease, 
undergoing  hormonal  and  non-hormonal  treatments,  in  perimenopause  or  menopause,  as  well  as 
those who had irregular menstrual cycles in the last 12 months before vaccine administration. After 
that there remained 164 women who were in reproductive age and declared regular menstrual cycle 
before the vaccination with mean age 35.8 ± 7.2 years. According to their analysis, approximately 
50-60 % of reproductive age women reported menstrual cycle irregularities after the first dose and 
60-70 % of them after the second dose of COVID-19 vaccine regardless of the type of vaccine. After 
both first and second vaccine, the most common alternations seem to be anticipated, longer, and 
heavier  menstrual  cycle  than  expected  and  usual.  Hypothetically,  one  can  compare  the  general 
number  of  37.8 %  of  menstrual disturbances  prior  to  the  vaccination  (Trogstad  et  al.)  with  these 
results of 50-60 % of reported menstrual irregularities after the first dose and 60-70 % after the 
second dose of COVID-19 vaccine. The increase of the percentage of menstrual disturbances after 
COVD-19 vaccine is evident. 
Despite the study limitations, the critical discussion and analysis of studies’ methodology and their 
conclusions  should  be  performed.  Thus,  the  MAH  is  requested  to  perform  the  critical  in-depth 
analyses  of  the  mentioned  studies,  their  methodology,  conclusions  and  limitations  along  with  the 
character of studied disorder. The MAH is asked mainly for the analyses of studies of Trogstad et al., 
Lee et al., Male et al., Zhang et al., Netherland PV Lareb and Laganà et al. 
Ad Q4: The MAH assessed in detail only 14 cases from a total of 4000 cases from post-marketing 
data.  These  14  cases  were  serious  or  medically  confirmed  and  at  the  same  time  with the date of 
vaccination and onset, known previous menstruation pattern. MAH stated that based on the WHO-
UMC system all these 14 cases were possibly related due to temporal association.  
Unfortunately,  there  is no  discussion  and information  on  the other  serious  or medically  confirmed 
cases.  Similarly,  no  cases  with  positive  rechallenge  from  MAH’s  database  or  EudraVigilance  have 
been presented by MAH.  The review, analyses and discussion presented by MAH is very poor and 
insufficient to make any conclusion. The MAH is therefore asked to perform the proper analyses and 
discussion  of  serious  cases,  medically  confirmed  cases  and  cases  with  positive  rechallenge.  The 
discussion of cases should be done according to instructions of question 4 included the case review 
of all the cases with WHO-UMC Causality assessment; a justification of causality category should be 
given for each case. 
Beside the incorrect calculation of the O/E analyses provided by MAH, corrected by the Rapportuer, 
the MAH also included only the cases where known female gender was reported. We are missing the 
meaning for exclusion of other cases of heavy menstrual bleeding without any discussion. Moreover, 
the  consideration  of  back  log  data  in  O/E  analysis  provided  by  MAH  is  unclear.  However,  the  O/E 
analyses  is  difficult  to  be  calculated  given  the  high  rate  of  underreported  cases  as  well  as 
underestimated background incidence; the significance of this analysis is thus lower. 
The proper mechanism of action for menstrual disorders after the vaccination is still unclear. Of note, 
the  study  of  Nguyen  et  al.  did  not  demonstrate  higher  risk  of  menstrual  disorders  in  relation  to 
pandemic  situation.  The  question  of  Rapp  to  the  MAH  is  supported.  Is  there  a  better  way  how  to 
study non-serious menstrual disorders such as heavy menstrual bleeding after vaccination by MAH?  
Overall,  the  MAH’s  assessment  is  of  poor  quality.  We  agree  that  causal  relationship  should  be 
determined especially on the medically confirmed cases, but concurrently the nature of this particular 
condition should be taken into account. In some cases, the nature of condition cannot allow medical 
confirmation. The majority of reported cases are non-serious but still unexpected according to SmPC 
Signal assessment on heavy menstrual bleeding with COVID-19 mRNA vaccine 
(Spikevax)  
EMA/PRAC/897385/2022  
Page 33/64 
 
 
 
 
 
of Spikevax. Thus, the proper analyses and discussion needs to be done and another round of this 
signal (EPITT no: 19780) is required. 
Of note,  MS1 proposed that the responses to the LoQ should be assessed in the next PSUR. We are 
of the opinion that this signal should be better run as a single signal procedure, as the MAH should 
performed the proper analyses and discussions, and comprehensive review of this issue is expected. 
However, further assessment could alternatively be done also in the next PSUR based on preference 
of the PRAC. 
Overall, we are of the opinion that the imbalance of clinical data and data from literature indicate at 
least reasonable possibility of causal relationship between heavy menstrual bleeding and Spikevax 
vaccination; and after further proper assessment we expect that PI could be updated with the risk of 
heavy menstrual bleeding. 
PRAC Co-Rapporteur Assessment Comment: As stated by MS2 colleagues the majority of ICSRs are 
non-serious reports with short-term duration and mainly self-evaluation and patient self-reporting. 
As pointed out, this is not an ideal situation for establishing causal relations for demonstrating causal 
relationship  (lack  of  case  definition,  subjective  assessment).  A  disproportional  reporting  of  heavy 
menstrual bleeding in different regions and different EU is noted, which may indicate reporting bias. 
It may be of interest to analyse case reports prior and after media attention of this issue.  
Observational studies with mixed results have addressed this issue. The evidence of cross-sectional 
studies  and  the  published  spontaneous  reports  are  considered  to  be  low  and  thus  should  be 
interpreted with caution.  
Concerning the imbalance of cases of heavy menstrual bleeding observed in clinical trials the MAH 
provided  only  brief  information.  Based  on  this  brief  information,  no  consistent  pattern  could  be 
detected. All case reports were apparently confounded and/or alternative causes have more likely 
caused the event. Based on this data, a reasonable causal relationship with vaccination cannot be 
established.   
Comment MS3: 
We overall agree with both PRAC Rapporteurs that more data are needed to include heavy menstrual 
bleeding  in  section  4.8  of  the  product  information.  Specially,  the  cases  with  positive  rechallenge 
should  be  investigated  in  detail.  In  addition,  more  studies  would  be  necessary  to  reach  firm 
conclusions, although we believe that a proper study design may be difficult in practice.  
However, it is a fact that a large number of reports on heavy menstrual bleeding for both Comirnaty 
and Spikevax, some of them with positive rechallenge, have been reported and that available major 
studies (Torgstad and Carpensen), albeit limitations, points towards heavy menstrual bleeding.  
Therefore,  although  it  is  unclear  a  causal  relationship  with  the  vaccine,  this  issue  may  create 
unnecessary  worries  in  women,  being  normally  mild  and  transitory  disorders,  we  propose  that  a 
general  warning  in  section  4.4  could  be  implemented  to  offer  information  about  the  temporal 
association  with the  vaccine  as  well  as to  state that  the  reported  cases  are mostly  transitory  and 
mild:

“Cases  of  heavy  menstrual  bleeding  temporarily  associated  with  <Comirnaty>  <Spikevax> 
vaccination have been reported. Most of them are transient and mild in nature” 
Co-Rapporteur Assessment Comment: The proposal of MS3,  MS4 and MS5 in favour of a warning 
statement need to be discussed by PRAC. The Co-Rapporteur supports the view of MS3 and MS4 that 
heavy menstrual bleeding should not be labelled in section 4.8 of the SmPC.   
Comment MS6: 
The information provided by the MAH for Spikevax had similar limitations than that of Comirnaty’s, 
with significant number of the spontaneous reports excluded from the analysis (initially 4000 ICSRs, 
of  which  finally  14  cases  were  considered  by  the  MAH).  Despite  the  lower  number  of  reports  for 
Spikevax, we consider, that the overall picture of the data is similar, and therefore the end result of 
this signal should be similar for these two products. 
For Comirnaty we endorse the Rapporteur’s view that the Trogstad et al study and the spontaneous 
reporting data indicate a potential causal relationship or at least a reasonable possibility of that, and 
endorse the Rapporteur’s proposed recommendation.  
Therefore, we suggest that the that “heavy menstrual bleeding” should be listed in section 4.8 of the 
SmPC for Spikevax as well. Further, we suggest the use of the MedDRA PT ‘heavy menstrual bleeding’ 
instead of the LLT ‘heavy period’ in the SmPC section 4.8.  
Heavy  menstrual  bleeding  is  an  ADR  that  seldomly  leads  to  contacts  with  health  care  and  thus is 
likely to be reported mostly by consumers. Since the diagnosis of heavy menstrual bleeding relies on 
the anamnesis given by the patient, no medical confirmation is necessary for a reliable case, and the 
non-serious  cases  are  as  relevant  for  the  causality  consideration  as  the  serious.  We  acknowledge 
that case-level analysis is not possible for all the cases given the number of reports. However, we 
do not agree with the approach that this leads to dismissing majority of the ICSRs when assessing 
the causal relationship.  
Consumer reporting has also been promoted for a decade in the EU, and these reports cannot be 
excluded from safety analyses, at least when received in unforeseen quantities, although they are of 
limited quality. If they are considered of no value, the whole concept of consumer reporting should 
be re-evaluated. 
PRAC Co-Rapporteur Assessment Comment. The arguments are acknowledged. Heavy menstrual 
bleeding in particular if self-limited and transient will not result in a HCP contact in the majority of 
cases, in particular under the conditions of a pandemic.  
For individual ICSRs is usually difficult (if not mostly impossible) to establish a causal association or 
absence of association independent whether they are consumer of HCP reports. (Consumer and 
HCP reports may differ concerning diagnostic certainty). Therefore, even positive re-challenge 
cases may not provide much more evidence 
The Co-Rapporteur is of the opinion that the totality of data does not justify a labelling in 4.8 for 
the reasons provided in the preliminary ASR.

Comment MS7: 
We agree that the data provided in support of the signal has limitations. The nature of the condition 
provides challenges in an evaluation (such as it being transient and therefore not necessarily reported 
to a physician, underreporting due to the benign condition and its high prevalence in the population 
at baseline). We agree with the PRAC Co-Rapporteurs comment on the limitations in the O/E-analyses 
provided in the MAHs response. O/E-analysis are of less use for a common medical condition such 
as menstrual disturbances, compared to rarer diagnoses and diseases with more stringent definitions. 
The focus of the assessment should include review of case narratives with focus on cases with positive 
rechallenge, but unfortunately this was not adequately analysed by the MAH, and therefore the data 
in this evaluation has severe shortcomings. 
Given the guidance statements in the SmPC Guideline 2009 of «..at least a reasonable possibility…» 
we are of the opinion that the conclusion by the PRAC Co-rapporteur sets the bar for including this 
in the product information too high. We consider it unrealistic to address this issue in future controlled 
trials. Post-marketing data do not support dismissing the signal. Overall, we consider that there is at 
least a reasonable possibility of a causal association. This supports the inclusion of the term in the 
PI. 
PRAC Co-Rapporteur Assessment Comment: The points are acknowledged, however the assessor is 
of  the  opinion  that  lowering  the  standards  for  the  evaluation  of  potential  causal  association  may 
create unforeseeable problems for future assessments of potential signals.  
Comment MS5: 
MS5 partially endorses the Rapporteur assessment report. 
It appears that some information is still missing from MAH such as narratives of clinical cases and 
assessment of positive re-challenge cases. 
 MS5 considers that the available data cannot be ruled out a causal relationship between vaccination 
and heavy menstrual bleeding. For a more robust evaluation of this potential signal, the MAH should 
further  review  all  positive  re-challenge  cases  and  should  propose,  as  needed,  an  update  of  the 
product information or additional minimisation risk measure. 
MS5 proposes that the MAH provide the cumulative review and the PRAC assess this review within a 
next turn of this signal and not close the signal for now. 
In addition, awaiting for more comprehensive analyses on this important topic form the MAH, MS5 
proposes a warning information to the public and healthcare professionals to be added in the section 
4.4 of the SmPC. If accepted for Spikevax, considering the uncertainties in the mechanism of action, 
the number of cases with both Spikevax and Comirnaty and heterologous vaccination patterns, this 
warning information should be also added in the SmPC of Comirnaty. 
PRAC  Co-Rapporteur  Assessment  Comment:  The  points  raised  by  MS5  are  acknowledged.  The 
proposal for a 4.4 warning needs to be discussed by PRAC.

We generally endorse the PRAC (Co)-Rapporteurs conclusions and have some additional comments. 
It is agreed that clinical trials provide the ideal setting for assessing the association between vaccines 
and menstrual changes. Nevertheless, we consider that further information could be also retrieved 
from  observational,  self-controlled  studies.  Thus,  we  propose  to  request  to  the  MAH  whether  this 
issue may be investigated in the ongoing PASS studies planned in the RMP. 
PRAC Co-Rapporteur Assessment Comment: The points are endorsed.  
Comment MS4: 
We endorse the PRAC Rapporteur’s recommendation that current data is not sufficient to conclude 
on a reasonable causal relationship between vaccination ad heavy menstrual bleeding.  
We also support MS8 comment that the MAH should be requested to investigate whether additional 
data could also be collected through PASS studies planned in the RMP.  
Finally,  we  support  the  comment  from  MS3  that  changes  in  menstruations  being  an  important 
concern among women of childbearing age, a general warning in section 4.4 could be implemented 
for reassurance, stating that the reporting cases are mostly transitory and mild. The text we propose 
is amended as:  
“Menstrual changes, such as heavier menstrual bleeding, temporarily associated with <Comirnaty> 
<Spikevax> vaccination have been reported. Most of them are transient and mild in nature” 
PRAC Co-Rapporteur Assessment Comment: See comments above  
Comment MS9: 
MS9  agrees  with  the  assessment  conclusions  of  the  PRAC  rapporteur  for  the  above-mentioned 
procedure. We have no further comments. 
Comment MS10: 
MS10 agrees with the conclusions of the PRAC Rapp AR for the above-mentioned procedure. 
Comment MS11: 
The assessment by the PRAC-Rapporteur is fully endorsed. We have no additional comments. 
3.5.  Updated rapporteur's proposed recommendation  
The signal of heavy menstrual bleedings should be closed and further assessed in the next PSUR. 
1. 
The MAH is kindly asked to explore the possibility of further investigating the issue of 
heavy menstrual bleeding in a structures and prospective way in ongoing or subsequent 
studies, e.g. PASS studies planned in the RMP and clinical trials. The MAH should outline

which  possibilities  have  been  explored  and  should  provide  this  evaluation  in  the  next 
PSUR. 
2. 
The  MAH  should  provide  the  following  information  not  included  in  the  response  in  the 
next PSUR: 
i. 
ii. 
An  explanation  how  adverse  events  related  to  heavy  menstrual  bleeding  were 
reported (solicited/non-solicited reporting). 
A  specification  of  the  number  of  female  study  participants  of  childbearing  age 
and the length of follow-up of this cohort. 
iii. 
A  critical  discussion  of  the  numerical  imbalance  of  heavy  menstrual  bleeding 
events in the clinical trial considering detailed clinical information of these case 
reports. 
3. 
The MAH is kindly asked 
i. 
ii. 
to clarify in the next PSUR how the conclusion regarding number of re-challenge 
cases in response to ITEM 3 was reached.  
to  perform  a  new  evaluation  of  cases  with  the  aim  to  identify  possible  re-
challenge  cases.  If  re-challenge  cases  are  identified,  an  assessment  of  these 
should  be  provided.  During  assessment,  information  on  potential  confounding 
factors  should  be  considered.  Narrative  information  should  be  included  in  the 
identification  of  cases  with  positive  re-challenge.  The  analyses  of  re-challenge 
reports should be presented in the next PSUR. 
iii. 
to carefully and comprehensively analyze and discuss, besides all cases with a 
positive  rechallenge,  all  serious  cases  and  all  medically  confirmed  cases.  The 
discussion of  cases  should  be  done  according to the  instructions  of  question  4 
and include the case review of all the cases with WHO-UMC causality assessment; 
a justification of causality category should be given for each case. Information 
should be presented in the next PSUR. 
4. 
The  MAH  is  requested  to  perform  an  in-depth  analyses  of  the  available  studies,  their 
methodology, conclusions and limitations along with the character of studied disorder in 
addition to the brief discussion presented in the response of this signal procedures. The 
studies  to  be  reviewed  should  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  those  conducted  by 
Trogstad et al., Lee et al., Male et al., Zhang et al., Netherland PV Lareb, and Laganà et 
al. The detailed analysis of the evidence from studies are expected to be presented in 
the next PSUR.  
3.6.  Adopted PRAC recommendation 
Having considered the data submitted by the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH), the PRAC 
concluded that the current evidence is insufficient to warrant an update to the product information 
at present. 
The PRAC has agreed that the MAH of COVID-19 MRNA vaccine (nucleoside-modified) Spikevax, 
(Moderna Biotech Spain, S.L.) should provide an updated cumulative review of heavy menstrual 
Signal assessment on heavy menstrual bleeding with COVID-19 mRNA vaccine

bleeding post-vaccination by 24/08/2022. The MAH should provide responses to the following list of 
questions: 
List of Questions: 
1.  The MAH should discuss the possibility of further investigating the issue of heavy menstrual 
bleeding in a structured and prospective way in ongoing or subsequent clinical studies. The 
MAH should outline which possibilities have been explored. 
2.  The MAH should include in the updated review the following information on clinical trials: 
a.  The exposure (patients’ years) of female study participants of childbearing age in clinical 
trials. 
b.  A detailed presentation (complete narrative and relevant case report form information) of 
cases of heavy menstrual bleeding in clinical trials. 
3.  The MAH should provide an updated case review, as per the below: 
a.  All serious cases of heavy menstrual bleeding. 
b.  All case reports of re-challenge of heavy menstrual bleedings with subsequent vaccination. 
c.  The MAH should include in the case review also the cases in which there was concomitant 
use of other medicinal products (including concomitant use of contraceptives), or lack of 
information on medical history. Should confounders make a case a clear explanation should 
be provided. 
d.  An assessment of the case reports according to UMC causality assessment criteria 
e.  The MAH should justify the causality assessment, if “unlikely” or “non assessable 
/unclassifiable” is used. 
4.  In addition to the above-mentioned review which should include all case narratives, the MAH 
should provide a table as specified below. The table should include all serious and/or positive 
rechallenge cases and information including the categories shown in the separate columns. The 
MAH can suggest additional columns, if deemed useful. Data from this table should be easily 
extractable for assessment. 
The MAH should prioritize all ICSRs relating to this signal when handling the backlog of cases and 
report on the backlog at time of DLP. 
The MAH should discuss the need for any potential amendment to the product information and/or 
the risk management plan and make accordingly a proposal for changes to the relevant sections 
with this discussion. 
The PRAC will assess this updated review within a 60 days’ timetable.

4.  Additional evidence II 
On 26 August 2022, the PRAC Co-Rapporteur received responses from the MAH to the PRAC’s 
questions listed in section 3.6. 
4.1.  Assessment of further information 
4.1.1.  Item 1 
“The MAH should discuss the possibility of further investigating the issue of heavy menstrual 
bleeding in a structured and prospective way in ongoing or subsequent clinical studies. The MAH 
should outline which possibilities have been explored.” 
MAH response: 
The MAH points out that menstrual cycle disorders are challenging to study even in clinical trials. 
The physiology of the menstrual cycle is complex, and variations in cycle length and bleeding 
intensity are expected even under normal circumstances. The MAH refers to the International 
Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) definition of heavy menstrual bleeding, i.e. a 
volume that interferes with the patient's physical, social, emotional, and/or material quality of life. 
This measure is subjective and implies a comparison to the individual baseline. If information was 
collected only after a vaccination event, it would be difficult to interpret. Since menstrual disorders 
historically were not a topic of potential concern in vaccine trials, baseline menstrual data were not 
collected in the clinical program. Now that the benefit of the approved vaccines against coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been clearly demonstrated, placebo-controlled trials are no longer 
standard and no longer feasible. The existing trials lack a control group. On the one hand, only 
very large trials with a substantial number of women of childbearing age would be conclusive. 
However, given the expected natural variation in menstruation and the high prevalence of heavy 
menstrual bleeding, a control arm is critical because data from an uncontrolled cohort would be 
difficult to interpret. The MAH acknowledges that the sensitivity of the capture of heavy menstrual 
bleeding could be enhanced by soliciting this adverse event during follow-up. At the same time, it 
expresses concern that the “impact of solicited reporting might disproportionately increase this 
subjective measure”. The MAH assures to continue monitoring heavy menstrual bleeding through 
routine surveillance as well as the ongoing prospective cohort studies which are conducted by 
independent third party investigators (e.g., NIH funded studies conducted by Boston University, 
Harvard Medical School, John’s Hopkins University, Michigan State University, and Oregon Health 
and Science University). 
Comment PRAC Co-Rapporteur: 
The PRAC Co-Rapporteur agrees with the MAH that for a meaningful evaluation, data would need to 
be collected over both pre- and post-vaccination intervals. The PRAC Co-Rapporteur also 
acknowledges the challenges of such investigations. The PRAC Co-Rapporteur does not support the 
MAH’s statement “[…] it is expected that the impact of solicited reporting might disproportionately 
increase this subjective measure”. Medicine and health encompass numerous subjective aspects 
that must be taken into account just as much as objectively measurable parameters. Subjective 
measures are the endpoints of clinical trials for many drugs and therapeutic interventions, although 
this can be challenging. Examples include pain, quality of life and patient satisfaction. However, in 
lieu of further elaboration, reference is made to the literature on vaccines and patient-related 
outcomes [1,2]. 
The discussion of this signal should prompt consideration of the menstrual cycle in future studies.

However, concrete concepts on how this could be realized are not to be found in the MAH’s 
response. Question not resolved.  
4.1.2.  Item 2 
“The MAH should include in the updated review the following information on clinical trials: 
a.  The exposure (patients’ years) of female study participants of childbearing age in clinical 
trials. 
b.  A detailed presentation (complete narrative and relevant case report from information) of 
cases of heavy menstrual bleeding in clinical trials” 
MAH response: 
4.1.2.1.  Exposure in clinical trials 
The MAH reviewed the two studies mRNA-1273-P301 (NCT04470427) and mRNA-1273-P203 
(NCT04649151). 
a.  mRNA-1273-P301 is an ongoing 3-part (A, B, C), phase 3, randomized, observer-blind, 
placebo-controlled, stratified, efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety study conducted at 
multiple sites across the United States with participants 18 years of age and older. In part 
A, individuals are randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either 2 injections of 100 µg of mRNA-
1273 or 2 injections of placebo control each given 28 days apart. Part B is an open-label 
observational phase designed to offer participants who received placebo in part A and who 
meet the emergency use authorization (EUA) eligibility criteria an option to request and 
receive mRNA-1273. Part C is an open-label observational phase to evaluate the safety and 
immunogenicity of a 50 µg booster dose of mRNA-1273. 
b.  Similarly, study mRNA-1273-P203 is a 3-part (A1, B1, C) study of the safety, 
reactogenicity, and efficacy of mRNA-1273 in healthy adolescents aged 12 to under 18 
years. In part A, adolescents are randomly assigned 2:1 to receive either 2 injections of 
100 µg of mRNA-1273 or 2 injections of placebo control each given 28 days apart. Part B is 
an open-label observational phase designed to offer participants who received placebo in 
part A of the study and who meet the EUA eligibility criteria an option to request and 
receive mRNA-1273. Upon availability of another COVID-19 vaccine authorized for 
emergency use in adolescents, the study transitioned to part B, the open-label 
observational phase. In part B, participants who were age-eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine 
authorized for emergency use could request unblinding. Placebo recipients were 
subsequently offered mRNA-1273. Part C is an open-label observational phase designed to 
offer a 50 µg mRNA-1273 booster dose to ongoing study participants in part A1 and part 
B1. The booster dose was administered at least 5 months after completion of the mRNA-
1273 primary series. 
Two clinical studies (mRNA-1273-P301 and mRNA-1273-P203) sponsored by Moderna were 
reviewed as part of the updated response to the agency’s request for information. mRNA-1273-
P301 is an ongoing 3-part (Part A, Part B, and Part C), Phase 3 randomized, observer-blind, 
placebo-controlled, stratified, efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety study conducted at multiple 
sites across United States with participants 18 years of age and older.

Prespecified cohorts of participants who were either ≥ 65 years of age or 18 to < 65 years of age, 
including those with comorbid medical conditions, were included. Part A, is a randomized, placebo-
controlled, observer-blind phase study of individuals >18 years of age, randomly assigned 1:1 to 
receive either 2 injections of 100 μg of mRNA-1273 or 2 injections of placebo control each given 28 
days apart. Part B is an open-label observational phase designed to offer participants who received 
placebo in Part A of the study and who meet the EUA eligibility criteria an option to request and 
receive mRNA-1273. Part C is an open-label observational phase of the study to evaluate the safety 
and immunogenicity of a 50-μg booster dose of mRNA-1273. 
Study mRNA-1273-P301: The MAH defines the duration of follow-up as days between the first 
mRNA dose and either booster vaccination, death, discontinuation of the study, or the data cutoff 
of 05 April 2022. According to the MAH, female participants aged 18-55 years (n = 7,421) were 
followed up for a median of 359 days (range 4-618 days, 1st quartile 281 days, 3rd quartile 427 
days), resulting in an exposure of 7,220.96 person-years. 
Study mRNA-1273-P203 is a 3-part (Part A1, Part B1, and Part C) study of the safety, 
reactogenicity, and efficacy of mRNA-1273 in healthy adolescents ages 12 to < 18 years. Part A is 
a randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled study of adolescents randomly assigned 2:1 to 
receive either 2 injections of 100 μg of mRNA-1273 or 2 injections of placebo control each given 28 
days apart. Part B is an open-label observational phase designed to offer participants who received 
placebo in Part A of the study and who meet the EUA eligibility criteria an option to request and 
receive mRNA-1273. Upon availability of another COVID-19 vaccine authorized for emergency use 
in adolescents, the study transitioned to Part B, the Open-label Observational Phase. In Part B, 
participants who were age-eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine authorized for emergency use could 
request unblinding. Placebo recipients were subsequently offered mRNA-1273. Part C is an open-
label observational phase designed to offer a 50-μg mRNA-1273 booster dose to ongoing study 
participants in Part 1A and Part 1B. A booster dose was administered at least 5 months after 
completion of the mRNA-1273 primary series. 
Comment PRAC Co-Rapporteur: 
The exposure of female participants aged between 18 and 55 years in study mRNA-1273-P301 is 
given, but not the exposure in study mRNA-1273-P203. 
4.1.2.2.  Detailed presentation of cases in clinical trials 
The MAH searched its clinical database of the studies mRNA-1273-P301 (data cutoff 05 April 2022) 
and mRNA-1273-P203 (data cutoff 31 January 2022) using the MedDRA version 23.0 preferred 
terms (PTs) “menorrhagia”, “polymenorrhagia”, “menometrorrhagia”, “polymenorrhea”, and 
“vaginal hemorrhage”. 
The MAH identified three participants (between 13 and 15 years old) of the study mRNA-1273-
P203 who reported heavy menstrual bleeding via unsolicited reporting. All three cases were in the 
mRNA-1273 arm, considered non-serious and assessed as not related to mRNA-1273 by the 
principal investigator. According to the MAH, two of the three participants had a medical history or 
use of concomitant medication that provided a plausible alternate explanation for the heavy 
menstrual bleeding.

Table 1: Unsolicited reports of heavy menstrual bleeding, study mRNA-1273-P203. 
In the study mRNA-1273-P301 (A, B, C), the MAH identified 67 of 13,252 female participants who 
reported heavy menstrual bleeding via unsolicited reporting. When the search was restricted to 
women of childbearing age (18-55 years), 58 of 7,421 women reported heavy menstrual bleeding 
(Table 2). 
Table 2: Unsolicited reports of heavy menstrual bleeding by females between 18 and 55 years old 
who received at least one 100 µg dose of mRNA-1273, study mRNA-1273-P301. 
Comment PRAC Co-Rapporteur: 
In the MAH’s first report on this signal, the database of the phase 3 study NCT04470427 with a 
data lock point of 04 May 2021 was searched using the MedDRA version 24.0 PTs “heavy menstrual 
bleeding”, “menometrorrhagia”, and “polymenorrhagia”. The PRAC Co-Rapporteur had suggested 
to include the PTs “polymenorrhea” and “vaginal bleeding” in the search in order to identify more 
potential cases. Now, the MAH states to have searched using the MedDRA version 23.0 PTs 
“menorrhagia”, “polymenorrhagia”, “menometrorrhagia”, “polymenorrhea” and “vaginal 
hemorrhage”. However, “menorrhagia” (10027313) is a lowest level term (LLT) under the PT

(Spikevax)  
EMA/PRAC/897385/2022  
Page 43/64 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
“heavy menstrual bleeding” (10085423). Therefore, it might be the case that not all terms 
subordinate to the PT “heavy menstrual bleeding” have been considered in the MAH’s current 
search. Besides, the FIGO recommends not to use the term “menorrhagia” anymore. 
In one sentence, the MAH mentions six instead of three cases of heavy menstrual bleeding in the 
study mRNA-1273-P203, probably a typographical error. The time to onset of menorrhagia is 
rather long in two of the three cases with apparently several regular cycles between vaccination 
and AEs. Thus, the causal relationship between HMB and vaccination is considered to be unlikely. 
Comment on the third case: Under hormonal contraception, withdrawal bleeding is usually weaker 
and lasts less long than natural menstruation. This side effect is perceived as beneficial by women 
with irregular or particularly heavy bleeding. Hormone preparations are also frequently used to 
treat polymenorrhea, i.e. a cycle lasting less than 25 days. 
In its first report, with a data cutoff 04 May 2021, the MAH had identified six cases of heavy 
menstrual bleeding in study mRNA-1273-P301, five from the mRNA-1273 arm and one from the 
placebo arm. Now, according to the MAH, all 7,421 study participants aged between 18 and 55 
years had been treated with mRNA-1273 and its Table 2 refers only to people vaccinated with 
mRNA-1273. Appendix 1 lists 7 females who reported their bleeding event after treatment with 
placebo. However, if these 7 patients were not included in the MAH’s Table 2, there were not 58 
cases under 56 years of age. Presumably the MAH refers to all cases with bleeding events, 
including the 7 cases in which the event occurred before a vaccination with mRNA-1273. 
Comment on Appendix 1, study mRNA-1273-P301: Appendix 1 lists five serious events in women in 
between 20s and 40s years of age.  All these patients eventually underwent hysterectomy. TTO is 
very long and the causal association of the AEs and vaccination is considered to be unlikely.

mRNA-1273; it is unclear what the time to onset refers to. 
The age data in Appendix 1 show a median age of 42 years for all patients (n = 67, range 20-66) 
with a bleeding event, and 40.5 years (contradictory to the MAH’s Table 2) for patients aged 18-55 
years (n = 58, range 20-54). 18 of 60 women with heavy menstrual bleeding after application of 
(presumably) Spikevax reported a time to onset of less than 36 days (dose 1: n = 4; dose 2: n = 
7; dose 3: n = 7). The other females had at least one normal cycle between the vaccination and 
the onset of heavy menstrual bleeding. Of the patients aged 18 to 55 years, 7 had been last 
treated with placebo (dose 1: n = 1; dose 2: n = 6) and 41 with mRNA-1273 (dose 1: n = 3; dose 
2: n = 23; dose 3: n = 15) before the bleeding event occurred. An additional 10 patients had 
received both placebo and mRNA-1273; it is not clear from the MAH’s table to which intervention 
the time to onset refers, but all events occurred after the second dose. For the 41 bleeding events 
clearly following the administration of mRNA-1273, the median time to onset was 90 days (range

1-431 days, 1st quartile 27 days, 3rd quartile 174 days). In summary, the data from clinical trials 
do not constitute a signal for heavy menstrual bleeding associated with Spikevax. 
4.1.3.  Item 3 
“The MAH should provide an updated case review as per below: 
a.  All serious cases of heavy menstrual bleeding 
b.  All case reports of re-challenge of heavy menstrual bleeding with subsequent vaccination. 
c.  The MAH should include in the case review also the cases in which there was concomitant 
use of other medicinal products (including concomitant use of contraceptives), or lack of 
information on medical history. Should confounders make a case “not assessable”, a clear 
explanation should be provided. 
d.  An assessment of the case reports according to UMC Causality assessment criteria. 
e.  The MAH should justify the causality assessment, if “unlikely” or “non assessable, 
unclassifiable” is used.” 
MAH response: 
4.1.3.1.  Serious cases of heavy menstrual bleeding 
The MAH states having reviewed cases of heavy menstrual bleeding derived from all sources. For 
the interval between 18 December 2020 and 18 June 2022, it searched for valid spontaneous 
reports from healthcare professionals, authorities, consumers, and literature. Search terms were 
“Spikevax” and the MedDRA version 24.1 PTs “heavy menstrual bleeding”, “polymenorrhagia”, and 
“menometrorrhagia”. The MAH applied the FIGO-definition for heavy menstrual bleeding, which it 
describes as “excessive menstrual blood loss, which interferes with a woman's physical, social, 
emotional and/or material quality of life” and refers only to cyclic (ovulatory) menses. For causality 
assessment, the MAH employed the WHO-UMC system and, in the absence of an established risk 
window and biological plausibility, 60 days as an arbitrary upper limit for time to onset. 
Observed to expected analyses. For observed to expected analyses, the same procedure as 
described in chapter 3.1.1.4 was applied: “To estimate a reporting rate, the number of doses of 
Spikevax administered globally […] first was multiplied by 21 days to estimate exposed person-
time. The count of cases was then divided by this person-time. In order to err on the side of a 
more conservative reporting rate estimate, all cases were included regardless of whether or not 
they fell during the 21 days following a dose of Spikevax. The age and gender stratified expected 
number of cases were calculated by multiplying the background incidence rate by the total person-
years of estimated exposure accrued. The observed rate was then divided by the expected and 
presented with a 95% confidence interval.” In addition, the MAH carried out sensitivity analyses on 
the assumption that only 50% or 25% of the actual cases of heavy menstrual bleeding were 
recorded in the Moderna global safety database.

Table 4: Age-stratified observed to expected analysis of heavy menstrual bleeding as of 18 June 
2022. The background incidences were taken from the study by Stahlman et al. [3].  
Comment PRAC Co-Rapporteur: 
Background incidence (ICD coded events) may underestimate the true incidence as not all 
concerned females may consult a healthcare professional. 
Overview of cases. Cumulatively, through 18 June 2022, 5,791 cases (thereof 1,118 serious, 91 
associated with hospitalization, 647 medically confirmed, and 5,594 from regulatory authorities) 
with 6,291 events (thereof 999 serious, and 6,090 under the PT heavy menstrual bleeding) were 
reported. 
Table 5: Age distribution of cases. Median age 37 years (range 0-81), mean age 36.7 years. (Note 
the two reports in children < 2 years are a reporting error of a NCA.) 
The MAH received most cases from the European Economic area and the United Kingdom. The 
disproportionate reporting (EEA and for example USA) is notable.

Table 6: Distribution of cases by region. 
In 46.6% of events, the dose number was unknown; global vaccination numbers by dose are also 
limited. Thus, as far as assessable, the MAH did not detect significant reporting differences by 1st 
and 2nd dose. The MAH gives the time to onset – under the condition that time to onset and dose 
number are known – as a mean of 15.3 days (standard deviation 83.5) and a median of 6.0 days. 
Serious events. 915 serious cases reported 999 serious events; 91 of these cases involved 
hospitalization. According to the MAH, distribution by age, gender, source, and region of origin is 
similar to the cumulative distribution presented above. As far as can be specified under the above-
mentioned limitations, more serious events were reported after the 1st than after subsequent 
vaccine doses. When time to onset and dose number were known, 60-68% of the serious events 
occurred within less than 14 days of vaccination for doses 1-3. The mean time to onset was 13.5 
days (standard deviation 23.1), the median time to onset 7 days (range 0-372). 
After medical review, 30 of the 915 serious cases were excluded: 13 after a different COVID-19 
vaccine, 16 with non-menstrual bleeding (including one vaginal bleeding during pregnancy and 15 
reports of postmenopausal bleeding), and one case was identified as a duplicate. 350 of the 885 
cases had confounders, 419 cases lacked information on potential confounders, and two cases 
provided too little information for a causality assessment. The list of confounders included age (≥ 
45 or < 18 years), coagulopathy, infections, endocrine disorders, hormonal therapy, a history of 
menstrual disorders, and structural causes. 
The MAH points out the subjectivity of the FIGO definition of heavy menstrual bleeding. The 
patients' own perception does not reliably reflect the amount of blood loss. However, measuring 
blood loss required collecting and sending in all menstrual products, which the MAH considers 
cumbersome, expensive, and impractical in the post-marketing setting. Since there are many 
possible causes of heavy menstrual bleeding, sufficient information must be available, including 
age, medical and gynecological history, baseline characteristics of the menstrual cycle, concomitant 
medications, results of the diagnostic evaluation, treatment and response, and clinical course. The 
MAH notes that most of the reports had insufficient or missing information and case reports with 
none of the aforementioned information including time to onset of heavy menstrual bleeding and/or 
date of vaccination were assessed as “unassessable”. Causality for reports where temporal 
association was present, with at least information on medical history and concomitant medication 
or results of at least one gynecologic diagnostic evaluation for heavy menstrual bleeding and one 
or more confounders was assessed as “possible”, as well as causality for reports of recurrence of 
heavy menstrual bleeding after subsequent vaccination. 
According to the WHO-UMC causality assessment, the MAH did not rate any of the 885 serious 
cases as "certain" or “probable”. Because of the lack of clear biological plausibility, natural

background variation in menstrual cycle, lack of evidence of a full resolution of heavy menstrual 
bleeding prior to subsequent vaccination in most of the case reports, and incomplete and 
insufficient information needed to perform a comprehensive case and causality assessment to 
determine the presence or absence of other plausible alternate explanations for heavy menstrual 
bleeding, the MAH deemed causality “possible” even in the presence of elements of a positive 
rechallenge. It classified 75 cases as “possible” and 39 cases as “unlikely”, the latter based on 
other more likely causes of heavy menstrual bleeding and/or a time to onset greater than 60 days. 
The remaining 771 cases were categorized as “unassessable” due to insufficient evidence or 
missing data. 
Comment PRAC Co-Rapporteur: 
Heavy menstrual bleeding is defined as “excessive menstrual blood loss which interferes with the 
woman’s physical, emotional, social and material quality of life” [4,5]. A cyclic occurrence is not 
required by definition, but may provide clues to the underlying etiology. Nor is the term limited to 
ovulatory cycles. On the contrary, anovulatory cycles can be a reason for heavy menstrual 
bleeding, especially in adolescence or perimenopause. The “O” in PALM-COEIN stands for ovulatory 
dysfunction such as anovulation [4]. 
The PRAC Co-Rapporteur agrees with the MAH that actually measuring menstrual blood in the post-
marketing setting is not really feasible. However, the exact amount of menstrual blood loss is not 
the key problem, but its consequences, such as fatigue, limitations in work and social life, and 
anemia. In the clinical trial as well as in the post-marketing setting, surveys might be conceivable, 
for example, with the help of pictorial methods, since these offer a good balance between ease of 
use and accuracy [6]. 
The MAH’s tabular case presentation (Appendix 2, pp. 23-106) is appreciated. It is striking that, in 
none of the 885 cases presented, the question about confounders is answered with "no". Either the 
case lacks information or confounders are present. The categorization of the MAH that 
contraceptives are in general confounders is highly questionable and cannot be supported. 
The data in Appendix 2 give a median age of 36 years (range 16-81 years, 1st quartile 30 years, 
3rd quartile 43 years), and a median time to onset of 7 days (range 0-372 days, 1st quartile 1 day, 
3rd quartile 17 days). 
According to the MAH's analysis, 350 of the 885 serious cases have potential confounders, 
including age in 147 cases (≥ 45 years, n = 146 cases; 16 years, n = 2 cases; in the cases of one 
40-49 and one >75 year old , reference is made to missing information and no confounder is 
mentioned, while in the case of a 30-39 year old , age is listed as a confounder), a heterologous 
vaccination schedule in 86 cases, and contraception in 80 cases. Unfortunately, the MAH does not 
always distinguish between different contraceptive products, such as hormonal contraception and 
the copper intrauterine device (IUD, n = 2). 
4.1.3.2.  Case reports of re-challenge of heavy menstrual bleeding with subsequent 
vaccination 
The MAH emphasizes that the assessment of a positive rechallenge is complicated because of 
incomplete data regarding (i) the preceding menstrual characteristics, (ii) the duration of heavy 
menstrual bleeding, and (iii) the normalization of menstruation before revaccination. Furthermore, 
the short interval between the first and second vaccination is probably not sufficient to observe a 
recovery of menstrual bleeding before the subsequent vaccination. Therefore, when evaluating the 
rechallenge cases, the MAH focused on participants who reported having received at least three

(Spikevax)  
EMA/PRAC/897385/2022  
Page 48/64 
 
 
 
 
 
doses of a COVID-19 vaccine as the timing of the 3rd dose is flexible. Of 784 case reports identified 
reporting three or more doses of a COVID-19 vaccine, 370 (47.2%) were unassessable and 
excluded because they were missing information on the dose that immediately preceded the initial 
report of heavy menstrual bleeding or on the outcome of the rechallenge or lack of clarity 
regarding whether a rechallenge was performed. Five (0.6%) cases did not report a rechallenge, 
371 (47.3%) cases only reported one event of heavy menstrual bleeding with three doses of a 
COVID-19 vaccine and 38 (4.8%) cases reported recurrence of heavy menstrual bleeding on 
rechallenge. Most of these 38 cases reported heavy menstrual bleeding after all three COVID-19 
vaccine doses. The MAH deemed causality “possible” for the majority (94.7%) of the cases, but 
assessed none as “certain” or “probable”. 
Table 7: Cases with three doses of a COVID-19 vaccine, reporting the recurrence of heavy 
menstrual bleeding after subsequent vaccination. Most of the individuals with heterologous 
vaccination had a non-company vaccine to complete the primary series and then got Spikevax as a 
booster. 
In addition, the MAH also reviewed 54 cases that were coded in the global safety database as 
positive rechallenge cases, and the 915 serious cases. Of the total of 1501 cases reviewed, the 
MAH concludes that there was evidence of recurrent heavy menstrual bleeding in 69 cases. 
However, it judges the classification as true rechallenge cases to be very difficult in view of the 
natural variations in the menstrual cycle, the high background incidence of heavy menstrual 
bleeding and incomplete data in spontaneous reports. 
Comment PRAC Co-Rapporteur: 
The PRAC Co-Rapporteur is of the opinion that the mere lack of information on the outcome of the 
rechallenge does not allow a report to be classified as unassessable. The relevant factor is that the 
event occurred again and not necessarily whether it has (not) recovered/resolved. Events with 
unknown outcome must be considered in evaluations. 
In their response, the MAH tabulates 69 cases of a positive rechallenge (38 cases of rechallenge of 
heavy menstrual bleeding after dose 1 and/or dose 2 with subsequent vaccination [dose 3 or dose 
4], 21 serious cases of heavy menstrual bleeding with recurrence of heavy menstrual bleeding after 
subsequent vaccination, and 10 case reports coded as "rechallenge = yes" in the global safety 
database), with a median patient age of 36 years (range 20s-50s years, 1st quartile 29,5 years, 
3rd quartile 43 years). Time to onset is given in 46 cases and ranges from 0 to 43 days (median 4 
days, 1st quartile 1 day, 3rd quartile 18,5 days). In 67 cases, WHO-UMC causality was classified as 
"possible" and in one case each as “unlikely” and “unassessable”. In 37 cases, the MAH recorded 
confounders, and in 32 cases, it considered the information provided to be insufficient. A 
heterologous vaccination regimen was specified as a confounder in 19 of the 32 cases, the patient’s

age (≥ 45 years) in 11 cases, and hormonal contraception in 9 cases. However, whether and, if so, 
what role a heterologous COVID-19 vaccination regimen might play in the occurrence of menstrual 
disorders has not yet been determined. Besides, progesterone can help reduce heavy menstrual 
bleeding, as can a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system [7,8]. A patient reported having an 
IUD with normally none to sparse menstruation. The MAH cannot consider this circumstance as a 
factor predisposing to heavy menstrual bleeding. Similarly, a report described having an “irregular 
menstruation cycle”, an intrauterine device and “normally […] no or hardly any bleeding”. Some 
narratives are incomplete; apparently only the first paragraphs of the text are included in the table. 
4.1.3.3.  Case review including WHO-UMC causality assessment 
The MAH refers to Appendix 2. 
Comment PRAC Co-Rapporteur: 
Causality is rated as possible in 75 cases, unlikely in 39 cases, and unassessable in all remaining 
771 cases. The MAH attributes this to the fact that in most cases insufficient information was 
provided. 
In general, it appears that information is very limited in the overall majority of the ICSRs and it is 
acknowledged that assessment is difficult without sufficient clinical information on previous 
menstrual cycles, last menstrual period, medical history and concomitant mediation as well as 
potential individual stress factors. 
The re-analysis of ICSRs did not provide additional evidence on the signal. 
4.1.1.  Item 4 
“In addition to the above-mentioned review which should include all case narratives, the MAH 
should provide a table as specified below. The table should include all serious and/or positive 
rechallenge cases and information including the categories shown in the separate columns. The 
MAH can suggest additional columns, if deemed useful. Data from this table should be easily 
extractable for assessment. 
The MAH should prioritize all ICSRs relating to this signal when handling the backlog of cases and 
report at the time of DLP. 
The MAH should discuss the need for any potential management plan [sic] and make accordingly a 
proposal for changes to the relative sections within this discussion.” 
MAH response: 
The MAH refers to Appendix 2 and Appendix 3. 
Discussion. The MAH emphasizes that, with a reporting rate of 28.3 per 100,000 person-years, 
post-marketing cases of heavy menstrual bleeding were below those expected. The observed 
number of cases was lower than the expected number of cases with a rate ratio of 0.03 (95% CI 
0.03, 0.03). There was also a geographical imbalance with cases reported predominantly from the 
European Economic Area (71.2%) and the United Kingdom (18.8%), whereas the highest exposure 
of Spikevax was in the USA. No ICSR was assessed as certain or probable according to UMC 
criteria. The majority of reports had missing critical information on baseline menstrual cycle 
characteristics and medical history.

(Spikevax)  
EMA/PRAC/897385/2022  
Page 50/64 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The MAH points out that the events in clinical trials were mostly non-serious, transient and could 
be explained by other factors. 
Consistent with the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb report, the evaluation of a 
recurrence of heavy menstrual bleeding after subsequent vaccination was challenging, and only a 
small number of reports had sufficient information to make an assessment. Of the 784 cases 
reporting at least three doses of COVID-19 vaccine, a small percentage (4.8%) reported recurrence 
of heavy menstrual bleeding, however in the setting of natural variation in the menstrual cycle, 
high background incidence of heavy menstrual bleeding as well as lack of evidence of a full 
resolution of heavy menstrual bleeding prior to subsequent vaccination, the data do not support 
the suggestion that heavy menstrual bleeding with the subsequent vaccination is truly a positive 
rechallenge particularly given the incomplete data from spontaneous passive reports. 
The MAH’s literature review identified studies, but these were mostly cross-sectional and collected 
information using unvalidated questionnaires. As heavy menstrual bleeding is a common 
phenomenon, the menstrual cycle naturally varies and numerous causes can result in heavy 
menstrual bleeding, the lack of a comparator group or a self-controlled design make the results 
from these studies difficult to interpret. The MAH points to the recent systematic review by Nazir et 
al. [9] which included 78,138 women from 14 studies. 52.0% of these females reported some form 
of a menstrual problem after vaccination, most commonly menorrhagia, metrorrhagia, and 
polymenorrhea. The incidence rate of menstrual abnormalities varied widely from 0.83% to 90.9% 
across different studies evaluating all types of COVID-19 vaccine. As the authors point out, all of 
the studies are limited by lack of comparator groups and the heterogeneity in cohorts limits the 
generalizability of the results. The authors close that individuals subjected to COVID-19 vaccines 
may experience menstrual abnormalities, but that conclusions regarding the impact of COVID-19 
vaccination on the menstrual cycle can only be drawn once more high-powered studies, such as 
randomized controlled trials or longitudinal prospective population-based studies, enrolling 
genetically and socioeconomically diverse populations, are conducted. 
The MAH points out that although there have been reports of heavy menstrual bleeding after 
COVID-19 vaccination, it is important to note that normal variations exist within women over the 
lifespan and menstrual disturbances are common. Additionally, menstrual cycle features (such as 
bleeding volume) are subjective, not standardized, and collected by self-report which can introduce 
multiple biases including misclassification. 
The MAH emphasizes that there are theoretical hypotheses, such as the immune response leading 
to changes in hormones or an endometrial inflammation mediated by immune cells in the lining of 
the uterus, but no clear biological plausibility and no evidence to demonstrate a causal association 
between menstrual disorders and vaccination. 
A frequency with which women experience heavy menstrual bleeding after vaccination with 
Spikevax cannot be inferred from the published data. According to the MAH, as of 18 June 2022, 
184,939,184 (27.9%) of all 662,871,167 Spikevax doses were administered in women of 
childbearing potential (12-49 years) worldwide. Compared to this figure and given the frequency of 
menstrual disorders, the number of reports of vaginal bleeding after vaccination is low. Therefore, 
the MAH did not identify a new safety concern. It does not consider a change to the reference 
safety information, labelling or risk management plan to be necessary. Events of heavy menstrual 
bleeding will continue to be monitored through routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
Comment PRAC Co-Rapporteur:

(Spikevax)  
EMA/PRAC/897385/2022  
Page 51/64 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Even though menstruation can be influenced by a wide variety of factors, the reporting women 
obviously noticed a marked difference after vaccination compared to before. 
However, even in the case of serious events and/or positive rechallenge, causality apparently 
cannot be assessed in most cases mainly because of a lack of information. Furthermore, the 
reporting rate of heavy menstrual bleeding from clinical trials and post-marketing sources is not 
unexpected. In this context disproportionate reporting between EEA, UK and North America does 
not support the signal. 
As already discussed, currently available studies are mostly subject to multiple biases and are not 
capable to provide evidence of an association between heavy menstrual bleeding and Spikevax. 
The PRAC Co-Rapporteur agrees with the MAH that the topic of heavy menstrual bleeding can only 
be meaningfully addressed in prospective studies and that the current evidence is insufficient to 
establish a (at least reasonable) causal association. 
4.2.  Co-Rapporteur’s proposed recommendation 
In summary, the MAH adequately responded to most of the PRAC's questions. A more detailed 
review and presentation of ways to integrate the topic of menstrual disorders into future study 
designs would have been desirable. 
Exposure numbers in the mRNA-1273-P203 study are not provided. In this study with 12 to 17 
year old individuals, an imbalance is probably not present given the 2:1 design und three reports of 
heavy menstrual bleeding in the mRNA-1273 arm (thereof two with implausible time to onset) 
versus none in the placebo arm.  
The data from the study mRNA-1273-P301 do not constitute a signal of an increased risk of heavy 
menstrual bleeding, although there was no expedited reporting for this adverse event. 
The MAH’s observed versus expected analyses of the post-marketing data do not indicate an 
increased reporting of heavy menstrual bleeding. The review of individual cases contributes little to 
the knowledge on bleeding disorders after vaccination. Prospective studies on this subject are 
therefore indispensable. From the additional data presented, the PRAC Co-Rapporteur cannot 
conclude a risk of heavy menstrual bleeding after Spikevax that would warrant a change in the 
summary of product characteristics. 
Recently, an analysis of prospectively collected data was published [10]. This study included 
19,622 individuals, mostly younger than 35 years (n = 15,713) and from the UK, USA/Canada or 
Europe. 17.46% of the vaccinated cohort (n = 2,608) received Spikevax. In summary, vaccination 
against COVID-19 was associated with a small and likely to be temporary change in menstrual 
cycle length but no change in menses length. The intensity of the menstrual flow was not 
investigated, but at least the duration of bleeding was not prolonged. Another analysis of data 
collected by a menstrual cycle tracking smartphone application did not indicate “significant 
variations in the percentages of cycles with abnormal blood loss or pain intensity” [11]. However, 
the evaluations published to date are inconsistent in terms of their data quality, methodology and 
statements. So far, no clear conclusion can be drawn from them.

We thank the Rapporteur about this preliminary assessment report for the second round. However, 
MS5 does not agree with the conclusion from the Rapporteur assessment report and has additional 
comments. 
In MS5, menstrual disorders following vaccination against Covid-19 are closely monitored and 
analysed since December 27, 2020 in the context of a national safety monitoring for all Covid-19 
vaccines . As of April 2022, as described in table 1, an initial analysis regarding menstrual 
disorders had revealed 734 cases of haemorrhages with Spikevax (including 50 serious cases), of 
which 192 cases of “heavy mentrual bleeding” (12 serious cases) after vaccination with Spikevax. 
Of these 192 cases, 36 cases (18,8%) showed a positive rechallenge. To note, 53% of

During the previous round in June 2022, in this context and after a qualitative and quantitative 
analysis of these cases, we supported the update of the SmPC and PL to add a warning regarding 
this risk (Comirnaty and Spikevax). 
In parallel, we have collaborated for several months with various patients’ associations and HCP 
representatives, including obstetrician-gynecologists specialists, to better quantify and characterise 
the events related to menstrual disorders following COVID-19 vaccination.  
From these reports, as summarised in table 2, a new analysis regarding cases of menstrual 
disorders (reported between 19 July 2022 and 1 September 2022) has revealed 336 cases of 
haemorrhages (153 serious cases), including 182 cases of “heavy menstrual bleeding” (82 serious 
cases). Regarding these cases of heavy menstrual bleeding reported in MS5 during this period with 
Spikevax, 14 cases (7.6%) showed a positive rechallenge4.

These data are still being analysed qualitatively and this is a preliminary analysis.  
Moreover, we disagree with some points about the Rapporteur's assessment: 
- 
The Rapporteur defines “heavy menstrual bleeding” as “excessive menstrual blood loss which 
interferes  with  the  woman’s  physical,  emotional,  social  and  material  quality  of  life”  then 
writes  that  “menstrual  cycle  features  (such  as  bleeding  volume)  are  subjective,  not 
standardized,  and  collected  by  self-report  which  can  introduce  multiple  biases  including 
misclassification”.  
It  is  acknowledged  that  “heavy  menstrual  bleeding”  could  be  considered  as  subjective  in 
nature  and  cannot  be  measured  in  practice  by  standard  medical  criteria.  They  can  also 
strongly  vary  from  one  vaccinee  to  another  and  throughout  the  life  course.  However,  it 
cannot preclude a scientific conclusion whether this effect can be considered as an ADR. In 
a  general  way,  numerous  ADRs  can  be  considered  as  subjective  in  nature  and  can 
nevertheless be listed as ADR based on spontaneous reports (e.g. fatigue, nausea, dizziness, 
tinnitus, reactogenicity in small children). 
- 
The  Rapporteur  states  that  there  is  no  clear  biological  plausibility  and  no  evidence  to 
demonstrate a causal association between menstrual disorders and vaccination. 
In  our  view,  and  in  line  with  the  Rapporteur  for  the  signal  with  Comirnaty,  the  limited 
knowledge regarding the pathophysiological pathway is considered to neither strengthen nor 
weaken the signal. 
Consequently, considering:  
- 
- 
- 
- 
the high number of reports (>4 000) on heavy menstrual bleeding,  
some of them requiring blood transfusion,  
dozens  of  reported  cases  with  with  positive  rechallenge,  even  assessed  by  the  MAH  as 
“possible” (67 cases),  
two  major  studies  (Trogstad  and  Caspensen)  pointing  towards  an  association  with  heavy 
menstrual bleeding. 
MS5 considers that the available data supports at least a reasonable possibility of a causal 
association between heavy menstrual bleeding and the vaccination with Spikevax, the SmPC and 
PIL should be updated to reflect current knowledge, adding “heavy menstrual bleeding” to section 
4.8. 
Considering the uncertainties in the mechanism of action, the number of cases with both Spikevax 
and Comirnaty and heterologous vaccination patterns, such information should also be added in the 
SmPC of Comirnaty. 
Comment PRAC Co-Rapporteur: 
The  PRAC  Co-Rapporteur  thanks  MS5  for  the  detailed  feedback  and  agrees  with  parts  of  its 
arguments.  For  example,  in  section  4.1.1,  the  PRAC  Co-Rapporteur  had  addressed  the  need  to 
include subjective variables, which is now a standard part of many clinical studies.

However, the definition of heavy menstrual bleeding as “a volume that interferes with the patient's 
physical,  social,  emotional,  and/or  material  quality  of  life”  does  not  originate  from  the  PRAC  Co-
Rapporteur's  considerations,  but  corresponds  to  a  generally  accepted  one  (FIGO  definition).  The 
quote  “menstrual  cycle  features  (such  as  bleeding  volume)  are  subjective,  not  standardized,  and 
collected  by  self-report  which  can  introduce  multiple  biases  including  misclassification”  is  from 
chapters 3.1.1.7 and 4.1.1, which both summarise the conclusions of the MAH and do not reflect 
those of the PRAC Co-Rapporteur. The statement about biological plausibility also comes from the 
MAH and not from the PRAC Co-Rapporteur. The PRAC Co-Rapporteur's comments are either in the 
boxes  at  the  end  of  the  chapters  or  in  the  chapters  provided  for  this  purpose.  Other  formatting 
measures may need to be considered so that a clearer distinction can be made between the MAH's 
argumentation and the PRAC Co-Rapporteur's assessment, thus avoiding such misunderstandings. 
Despite  the  identification  of  cases  of  a  positive  rechallenge,  it  is  obviously  difficult  to  specifically 
attribute the occurrence of heavy menstrual bleeding to the application of mRNA vaccines. Heavy 
menstrual  bleeding  is  a  common  phenomenon,  and  apparently  the  data  quality  in  spontaneous 
reports  often  does  not  allow  a  sufficient  assessment  of  the  situation.  Considering  the  extensive 
exposure to Spikevax, spontaneous reports of heavy menstrual bleeding (including rechallenge case 
reports) are per se not unexpected. 
The PRAC Co-Rapporteur believes that menstrual characteristics can and should be included in future 
clinical studies. Then, the actual incidence could be better estimated. Also, one would gain knowledge 
whether  and  how  often  menstrual  disorders  also  occur  after  other,  non-mRNA  vaccinations  (cf. 
publications  on  vaccinations  against  human  papillomavirus,  poliovirus,  and  typhoid  fever, 
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pvr.2018.02.002,  https://doi.org/10.5694/j.1326-5377.1958.tb58387.x, 
and doi:10.1001/archinte.1913.00070050082008, respectively). 
Comment MS6 
The  conclusion  of  assessment  of  the  MAH  and  endorsed  by  Co-rapporteur  is  that  the  available 
evidence  is  insufficient  to  establish  a  causal  relationship  between  heavy  menstrual  bleeding  and 
Spikevax. We do not agree with this assessment. 
Regarding the evaluation of the postmarketing reports, we find the MAH’s causality assessment to 
be too strict and evaluation of the possible alternative explanations to be too exclusive. For example, 
it seems that use of an oral hormonal contraception, a hormonal IUD or an SSRI has categorically 
been evaluated to be a plausible alternative explanation/confounder for heavy menstrual bleeding, 
without an evaluation on how long the treatment has been used. If the patient has been using the 
same hormonal contraception or an SSRI for a longer period, we consider it to be quite unlikely cause 
for a sudden change in the menstrual pattern. Also, concomitant medical condition of hypothyroidism 
has  been  assessed  as  an  alternative  explanation,  although  if  the  diagnosis  is  not  recent,  these 
patients are likely euthyreotic due to substitution therapy. Further, also a heterologous vaccination 
has  been  assessed to be a  confounder  although,  as  the  Co-rapporteur  pointed  out,  it has  not  yet 
been determined what role, if any, a heterologous COVID-19 vaccination regimen might play in the 
occurrence of menstrual disorders. Therefore we consider that the analysis by the MAH cannot be 
considered to support the absence of causality. 
The MAH has identified 69 cases of a positive rechallenge. According to the table 7, it seems that in 
25 reports with rechallenge, heavy menstrual bleeding has occurred after all three COVID-19 vaccine 
doses,  further  supporting  a  causal  relationship.  We  disagree  with  the  MAH  that  medical  and 
gynecological  history  including  baseline  menstrual  cycle  characteristics,  diagnostic  evaluation  and 
treatment are critical for evaluation in all these cases, since a pattern can be seen even without full

details. Below are a few examples of reports we consider to support positive causality even though 
they lack details: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
:  an  adult  female  reported  that  after  each  dose  of  the  vaccine,  the  following  monthly 
menstrual  cycle  has  been  very  severe.  Much  more  severe  cramping,  much  more  bleeding 
and clotting, the cramps and heaviness of flow almost debilitating. Cycle usually returns to 
normal the following month. 
: an adult female patient experienced heavier menstruation after 1st, 2nd and 3rd vaccination 
in the period after. Has an IUD with normally none to sparse menstruation. The patient had 
no other reported health issues. 
: an adult female had heavy periods for two months following each one of the 3 vaccinations 
:  an  adult  female  experienced  heavy  menstrual  bleeding  approximately  21  days  after  the 
third dose. The period came at the same time as normal, but it was a far heavier period than 
usual. The same happened with the periods following both the first and the second dose of 
the vaccine. 
:  an  adult  female  patient  reported  having  heavy  periods  after  two  vaccinations  (Astra 
Zeneca). Finished her period and received third dose of Moderna vaccine on the same day 
and then started bleeding heavily two days later. 
We think that the conclusion by the MAH and the PRAC Co-rapporteur sets the bar for 
establishment of causality and inclusion in the product information too high. There are >5700 
reports of heavy menstrual bleeding for Spikevax, with an average TTO of 15.3 days and a median 
TTO of 6.0 days. We think that the relatively short TTO supports more the likelihood of causality 
with Spikevax than a co-incidental event. Also, the review of rechallenge cases supports causality, 
as even with lack of all details it shows that in many cases the women have experienced the same 
kind of menstrual symptom after two or three vaccinations. Overall, we consider that there is at 
least a reasonable possibility of a causal association and that “heavy menstrual bleeding” should be 
listed in section 4.8 of the SmPC for Spikevax. 
Comment PRAC Co-Rapporteur: 
The  PRAC  Co-Rapporteur  appreciates  the  detailed  feedback  including  excerpts  of  exemplary 
narratives. It also criticised the overall classification of possible confounders and the categorisation 
of several cases by the MAH.  
It is acknowledged that ICSR causality assessment has a subjective element and that assessment of 
the  same  ICSRs  may  vary  among  different  assessors.  In  order  to  strengthen  individual  causality 
assessment  of  adverse  events  following  immunization  (AEFI),  WHO  has  developed  an  algorithm 
which is different from the UMC criteria. The different approaches of ICSR causality assessment show 
the  difficulty  of  consistent  assessment  of  spontaneous  reports  which  frequently  lack  important 
medical information. 
A  re-discussion  of  the  issue  in  the  PRAC  seems  to  be  necessary  in  order  to  decide  whether  the 
available evidence is sufficient to require an update of the SmPC and PIL. 
Comment MS2 
The conclusion of the MAH, which is endorsed by PRAC Co-Rapporteur, is that the current evidence 
is insufficient to establish a causal relationship between heavy menstrual bleeding and Spikevax. 
We are of the opinion that at least reasonable causal association has been already provided.

We support the Co-Rapp’s view that medicine and health encompass numerous subjective aspects 
that should be taken into account together with objectively measurable parameters. We would like 
to remind that subjective measures were taken into account when new ADRs relating to pain or 
paraesthesia were assessed after the vaccination. In these cases, the information was also 
collected only after a vaccination event with the difficulty to interpret it. Moreover, medical 
confirmation of these subjective symptoms does not increase credibility of patients’ reports, 
because in this situation the physician can only confirm what the patient told him. Similarly in the 
case of heavy menstrual bleeding, the predominant patients’ reports should not be a reason for 
rejection of this problem. The role of patient cases is significantly more important in situations, 
where causal relationship cannot be established based on the confirmed cases because of the 
nature of condition. 
The review of clinical trial mRNA-1273-P201 data identified 58 cases (from 7421 women, i.e. 0,8 
%) of heavy menstrual bleeding in active arm vs. 7 cases (from remaining 5831 women, i.e. 0,1 
%) from placebo arm. However, the MAH did not discuss this numerical imbalance and its 
statistical significance, even when the increase of the percentage of heavy menstrual bleeding in 
active arm versus placebo is evident. Additionally, the choice of the LLT MedDRA term 
(“menorrhagia”) and omitting the superior PT MedDRA term (“heavy menstrual bleeding”) 
predispose the results of heavy menstrual bleeding to be underestimated. In the 18 cases of heavy 
menstrual bleeding reported by women in active arm, the TTO was lower than 36 days. There is no 
information about TTO in placebo arm. We are of the opinion that the available data from 
clinical trial support the reasonable causal association between the heavy menstrual 
bleeding and vaccination with Spikevax. 
We would like to remind the supportive data and significant statistical results from the study of 
Trogstad et al. (commented in the first round of the signal). This study was focusing on number of 
menstrual disorders. For reduction of bias of awareness at the menstrual disorders, the 
questionnaire included several topics not related to menstruation to be answered prior to the 
questions of menstrual disorders. This study assessed 5688 Norwegian women aged 18-30 year 
and the data of individuals before and after vaccination was compared. The self-control 
case series design is described as a suitable design for investigation of vaccines. The bias between 
a case and a control caused by inter-individual differences is minimized using this type of study. 
When the exposure to vaccines is high in a general population, it could be expected that the 
populations of vaccinated and unvaccinated women are considerably different, and comparison of 
these groups could be less suitable. The selection bias was minimized by random assorting of 
women from another ongoing population study. Therefore, inclusion of women was not driven by 
the existing menstrual disorders following vaccination. The recall bias was significantly solved by 
the app which was used by almost 60% of women. Specifically for the Spikevax, the study 
identified heavier menstrual bleeding after first dose of Spikevax with relative risk 1.86 
(95% CI 1.54 to 2.26) and after second dose of Spikevax with relative risk 1.92 (1.67 to 
2.21). The prevalence of heavy menstrual bleeding was only 7.6 % prior to first dose of 
COVID-19 vaccination in comparison with 13.6 % in the first cycle after COVID-19 
vaccination and similarly 8.2 % prior to second dose of COVID-19 vaccination in 
comparison with 15.3 % after second dose of COVID-19 vaccination. We are of the opinion 
that these findings from the literature should be taken into consideration.  
Regarding to spontaneous reports, there are 5791 reported cases, from which 647 were medically 
confirmed (11,2 %), 1118 serious (19,3 %) and 91 cases with hospitalized patients (1,6%). 
Unfortunately, the MAH assesses the spontaneous reports in a questionable way; i.e. no 
information was provided to the TTO without knowing the specific number of dose used or no case 
Signal assessment on heavy menstrual bleeding with COVID-19 mRNA vaccine 
(Spikevax)  
EMA/PRAC/897385/2022  
Page 58/64 
 
 
 
 
 
of positive rechallenge was assessed if the outcome of the positive rechallenge was unknown. We 
agree with the Co-Rapp that it is not necessary to know the outcome of the rechallenge to conclude 
that the rechallenge has already occurred. Unfortunately, no assessment of medically confirmed 
and non-serious cases which could give more information was provided. The majority of 
reported cases are non-serious but still unexpected according to SmPC of Spikevax. The 
MAH’s assessment is still lacking the detailed discussion and information.  
We agree with Co-Rapp that even though menstruation can be influenced by a wide variety of 
factors, the reporting women obviously noticed a marked difference after vaccination compared to 
before. Overall, we are of the opinion that the imbalance of clinical data and data from literature 
indicate at least a reasonable possibility of causal relationship between heavy menstrual 
bleeding and Spikevax vaccination.  
Therefore, member state 4 proposes update of PI with the ADR heavy menstrual bleeding with the 
frequency unknown: 
Text for SmPC 
Section 4.8, frequency unknown: Heavy menstrual bleeding. 
Text for PIL 
Section 4 (possible side effects), frequency unknown: Heavy menstrual bleeding 
Comment PRAC Co-Rapporteur: 
The PRAC Co-Rapporteur values this thorough feedback. Ultimately, the majority of studies on heavy 
menstrual  bleeding  are  retrospective  surveys,  which  are  subject  to  several  biases.  In  the  study 
“Increased  Occurrence  of  Menstrual  Disturbances  in  18-  to  30-Year-Old  Women  after  COVID-19 
Vaccination” by Trogstad et al., the participants were part of an already ongoing cohort study. 52.2% 
(first dose) and 52.8% (second dose) of the women documented their cycle using an app. This rules 
out a major selection bias, but not a recall bias.  
Menstrual disorders have been described not only for mRNA  vaccines but also for vector vaccines 
against COVID-19 (and in the past also for non-COVID vaccines). Thus, a general reaction to the 
immune stimulus may be assumed rather than a specific side effect of mRNA-containing products. 
In view of scientific uncertainties, the PRAC Co-Rapporteur is of the opinion that the evidence is not 
sufficient to distinguish between causal and coincident effects. 
Whether it is proportionate to include one specific disorder – heavy menstrual bleeding – for mRNA 
vaccines only must be decided by PRAC. 
In case PRAC would decide to label heavy menstrual bleeding, the Co-Rapporteur is of the opinion 
that it is important to point out that usually heavy menstrual bleeding events are non-serious and 
transient. In our view this would be important to avoid that women with long-lasting symptoms may 
believe  in  a  vaccine  effect  and  may  therefore  not  consult  a  gynaecologist  in  due  time  with  the 
consequence of potential delayed diagnosis of other underlying diseases.

The PRAC Co-Rapporteur's conclusion is not endorsed. The Co-Rapporteur emphasizes the O/E-
analysis, the challenges caused by limited information in the majority of the ICSRs and the study 
by Edelman et al. 
Regarding ICSRs: Taking into account the nature of the reaction (reported from patients, being 
subjective) a high level of detailed information is not always realistic. Therefore, the bar for what 
the ICSRs must contain in order to be assessed is set unrealistically high from a medical point of 
view. According to the MAH, “most of the 38 cases” in which women received 3 doses of 
vaccination reported a heavy menstrual bleeding after each of 3 doses of vaccination. As such 
cases are normally considered to strongly indicate a causal association, a further discussion on 
these cases would have been useful.  
O/E-analysis: The MAH has provided an O/E-analysis, which was not requested by the PRAC, but 
was nevertheless assessed by the PRAC Co-Rapporteur. We consider that the value of an O/E-
analysis at this stage of the assessment for this particular signal is limited. An O/E-analysis is 
primarily used as a tool for signal detection and preliminary signal evaluation, and at present less 
emphasis should be made on this method.  
The publication by Edelman: The PRAC Co-Rapporteur discusses the study by Edelman et al in their 
recommendation section however this study did not evaluate heavy menstrual bleeding and is 
therefore of less relevance. 
Overall, we maintain our position that there is “at least a reasonable possibility” of a causal 
association, and thus the SmPC should be updated in accordance with the SmPC Guideline. 
Comment PRAC Co-Rapporteur: 
The O/E analysis indeed needs to be interpreted with caution, as it tends to underestimate the SMR 
(background rate based on medical visits which is known to reflect only a subset of heavy menstrual 
bleeding cases). Thus, the O/E analysis provides a flavour that reported number of cases are within 
the expected range. 
The publication of Edelman et al. was cited because (in addition to mentioning the first study from 
the United States by Edelman et al. in the first round of questions) it includes a large number (n = 
19,622)  of  participants  of  childbearing  age  and  a  comparison  is  made  between  vaccinated  (n  = 
14,936)  and  unvaccinated  (n  =  4,686)  individuals.  In  fact,  the  extent  of  blood  flow  was  not 
investigated. However, heavy menstrual bleeding is often associated with prolonged menses, so the 
study is not entirely irrelevant in the context of the present signal. The larger study confirmed the 
result of the first study by Edelman et al based on United States data. The result showed a slightly 
longer menstrual cycle in particular in females with two vaccinations in one cycle. Observed changes 
were similar across different vaccine types and not only related to mRNA vaccines. Changes were 
resolved as soon as the next cycle after vaccine receipt. Thus, results of the study are reassuring 
with regard to the impact of COVID-19 vaccination on menstrual cycle length. Besides, we rate the 
data  quality  of  the  study  higher  than  that  of  numerous  retrospective  surveys  and  cross-sectional 
studies. 
Comment MS4 
Although evidence to demonstrate an association between Spikevax and heavy menstrual bleeding 
is not very strong, such association cannot be completely excluded. After considering 
epidemiological data, some well-described cases and the cases with positive rechallenge, member

state 9 considers that a causal association is reasonably possible and that “heavy menstrual 
bleeding” should be included in 4.8. 
Comment PRAC Co-Rapporteur: 
We  agree  that  the  signal  of  heavy  menstrual  bleeding  is  not  very  strong.  The  argument  that  an 
association  cannot  be  excluded  cannot  (in  our  view)  justify  labelling.  However,  the  weight  of  the 
evidence needs to be discussed by PRAC. 
Comment MS3 
After a careful review of the updated data presented regarding this procedure, MS3 does not 
endorse the conclusions reached by the co-Rapporteur. 
In one hand, clinical trials data is inconclusive. In the study conducted in adults participants 
(NCT04470427), it seems that 58 cases of HMB were reported in participants that received mRNA-
1273 in phase A (randomly assignment to receive either mRNA-1273 or placebo control) or B (offer 
patients receiving placebo in phase A to request and receive mRNA-1273) of the study without 
further distinction between arms or study phases. However, in Annex I presented by the MAH there 
are HMB cases reported in placebo arm (7), mRNA-1273 arm (39) and in phase B of the study 
(patients receiving placebo followed by mRNA-1273) (24), which does not match the 58 cases 
initially reported by the MAH. The assessor does not consider that the 7 cases reported in the 
placebo arm are taken into account in the 58 cases initially reported by the MAH. Nevertheless, 
considering the presentation of the data, it is not possible to evaluate a possible imbalance 
between arms. 
In the other hand, the assessor acknowledges the limitations of postmarketing data, as it is already 
known. There are at least 38 cases reporting positive rechallenge in patients that had at least 3 
doses reported. Although cases where only 2 doses are reported may also show positive 
rechallenge. Therefore, it is unclear why the search took into account from 3 doses onwards. The 
MAH considered that the majority of cases had causality “possible”, but assessed none as “certain” 
or “probable”. However, according to the WHO-UMC causality criteria, if rechallenge information is 
available and there is no information on confounders, causality can be considered “certain” or 
“probable/likely”. This may be the case for at least 50% of these cases since there are 60.5% of 
the cases with confounders and 2 considered unlikely and unassessable by the MAH. In addition, 
the MAH identified 21 serious cases of HMB with recurrence of HMB after subsequent vaccination 
and 10 cases reported as “rechallenge=yes” in the global safety database. All this make a total of 
69 cases reported with positive rechallenge. 
The MAH discussed the difficulty of assessing rechallenge, nevertheless there are cases in which 
the patient is clearly reporting the vaccine doses after which has suffered HMB (e.g., case in which 
patient reported HMB specifically after 1st and 3rd dose) and this information should not be 
undermined based on the natural background variation in menstrual cycle or lack of evidence of a 
full resolution of HMB prior to subsequent vaccination or incomplete data. 
Furthermore, the number of cases of HMB keeps raising compared to the information previously 
provided by the MAH (section 3.1.1.4. of the AR). Lastly, regarding serious cases, the information 
is difficult to analyse. The MAH initially refers to 915 cases of which 91 were related to 
hospitalisation (seriousness criteria not stated for the remaining). After that, 30 are excluded due 
to other COVID-19 vaccine used, non-menstrual bleeding, limited information and case duplication. 
Of the remaining 885 cases, 350 are confounded and the other 533 serious cases are not discussed 
by the MAH, only the line listings and narratives are provided, precluding the analysis.

A cross-sectional study published by Baena et al that included 14 153 women who had received the 
full course of vaccination at least three months earlier. Of them, 11 017 (78%) reported menstrual 
changes. The main menstrual change reported was “more menstrual bleeding” (43%), followed by 
“more menstrual pain” (41.2%). “More or larger clots” was also reported (29.1%). Although self-
reported, the study was conducted shortly after the second dose of the vaccine administered, so 
the risk of recall bias in the participants is lower compared to other similar studies. In addition, 
Nazir et al conducted a systematic review that included 14 observational studies (3 cohorts and 11 
cross-sectional) and 78 138 vaccinated females, presented by the MAH. Of them, 39 759 women 
(52.05%) showed menstrual disorders. Menorrhagia, metrorrhagia and polymenorrhea were the 
most commonly reported problems. The author also mentions that although the studies themselves 
may have selection and recall bias due to the retrospective and self-reporting nature, prospective 
studies also provide similar insights into this phenomenon. The authors close that individuals 
subjected to COVID-19 vaccines may experience menstrual abnormalities, but that conclusions 
regarding the impact of COVID-19 vaccination on the menstrual cycle can only be drawn once more 
high-powered studies, such as randomized controlled trials or longitudinal prospective population-
based studies, enrolling genetically and socioeconomically diverse populations, are conducted. For 
this reason, the MAH should also make efforts to conduct observational studies, exploring different 
data sources and study designs that may allow to collect data from pre and postvaccination 
intervals (electronic healthcare record databases where patients with vaccination data is available 
should also be explored), instead of only awaiting data from third parties independent 
investigators. 
As mentioned by the co-Rapp in the report, “even though menstruation can be influenced by a wide 
variety of factors, the reporting women obviously noticed a marked difference after vaccination 
compared to before”. The available post-marketing and literature data support the idea of at least 
a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between HMB and Spikevax vaccination. Therefore, 
MS3 suggests that changes in the product information are warranted and HMB should be included 
in section 4.8 of the SmPC with unknown frequency. The PIL should be updated accordingly. 
Comment PRAC Co-Rapporteur: 
The PRAC  Co-Rapporteur would like to clarify the following points: the response from the MAH 
lists  a  total  of  67  cases  of  heavy  menstrual  bleeding  in  study  participants  between  20  and  66 
years  old.  Of  these,  heavy  menstrual  bleeding  occurred  in  7  participants  after  administration  of 
placebo,  in  31  after  the  1st  or  2nd  administration  of  mRNA-1273,  and  in  6  after  the  3rd  dose  of 
mRNA-1273.  23  individuals  had  received  both  placebo  and  mRNA-1273;  in  12  cases,  heavy 
menstrual  bleeding  occurred  after  the  1st  or  2nd  dose  (unclear  whether  after  placebo  or  mRNA-
1273),  and  in  the  remaining  11  cases,  after  the  3rd  dose.  Since  no  3rd  dose  of  placebo  was 
administered in study mRNA-1273-P301, these 11 cases must refer to the administration of mRNA-
1273. The 58 participants in Table 2 represent a subgroup, namely those aged up to 55 years. 
Appendix 1 also lists 58 women up to 55 years of age, so the numbers do match. The 7 placebo-
treated females are included here. We noted that “However, if these 7 patients were not included in 
the MAH’s Table 2, there were not 58 cases under 56 years of age. Presumably the MAH refers to all 
cases with bleeding events, including the 7 cases in which the event occurred before a vaccination 
with mRNA-1273”. We can therefore not follow MS3 objection at this point. 
Unfortunately, the data provided is ambiguous, which we had already criticised in our assessment – 
in  some  cases  it  is  not  clear  whether  the  event  occurred  after  placebo  or  mRNA-1273.  A  clear 
imbalance cannot be inferred from the data, because the follow-up time was certainly longer after 
mRNA-1273 application than after placebo administration. Ultimately, all 58 women under 56 years

of age had received mRNA-1273, and events were attributed to the most recent intervention. For 
the 58 participants aged between 18 and 55 years, the MAH gives an exposure of 7,220.96 person-
years. This translates into an annual incidence of 803/100,000 women, which at a median age of 
40.5 years is within the range expected according to the publication by Stahlman et al. In the entire 
group of 67 participants who experienced heavy menstrual bleeding, the median TTO was 49 days 
(n = 7; range, 20-179 days; TTO > 35 days in 5 of 7 cases [71%]) for events after placebo, and 
87.5 days (n  = 48; range,  1-431 days; TTO  > 35 days  [that means apparently  one normal  cycle 
between vaccination and event] in 34 of 48 cases [71%]) for events following mRNA-1273. 
For the 69 cases of a positive rechallenge, please refer to section 4.1.3.2. Even though the PRAC had 
asked for a WHO-UMC causality assessment, we would like to recall the criteria for the assessment 
of 
adverse 
events 
following 
immunisation 
(https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241516990). 
In the study by Baena-García L et al., “adenovirus vectored COVID-19 vaccines seem[ed] to be more 
associated  with  changes  in  the  menstrual  cycle  than  mRNA  vaccines”.  An  interesting  point  in  the 
study  by  Baena-García  L  et  al.  is  that  34.5%  of  patients  described  shorter  menses  and  21.1% 
described  longer  menses,  which  is  actually  counterintuitive  to  the  most  commonly  reported  more 
menstrual bleeding (43.3% of respondents). Less menstrual bleeding was observed by only 22.7% 
of the women. We agree with the comment by Marques TA, doi.org/10.1177/17455057221129395, 
that the study is prone to bias and that the same objections apply as for other retrospective surveys, 
despite the large number of 14,153 participants.  
In  an  observational  cohort  study  with  COVID-19  vaccine  recipients  who  reported  their  health 
experiences to v-safe in the United States (Wong KK et al., doi.org/10.1016/S2589-7500(22)00125-
X),  62,679  women,  i.e.  1.0%  of  a  total  of  5,975,363  female  respondents,  reported  on  menstrual 
irregularities  or  vaginal  bleeding.  Peri-  and  postmenopausal  bleeding  after  COVID-19  vaccination 
occurred, but, as the authors discuss, “it is unknown whether this bleeding represents a transient 
benign  event,  an  event  that  unmasks  pre-existing  pathology  (e.g.,  cancer  or  polyps),  or  a  purely 
coincidental event”. 
Results  of  studies  on  possible  effects  of  COVID-19  vaccination  on  menstruation,  funded  by  the 
National Institutes of Health, are not yet available. 
In fact, we believe that an immune stimulus such as a vaccination in general may trigger menstrual 
changes  –  just  like  infections,  stress  and  other  events.  However,  the  publications  to  date  do  not 
consistently show that COVID-19 is associated with menstrual changes including heavy menstrual 
bleeding nor that menstrual changes are a characteristic of mRNA vaccines. 
In the past, reports of menstrual disorders after non-COVID vaccines triggered some investigations. 
But there was little discussion on this issue compared to the current situation which is characterised 
by extensive exposure and high media attention. 
We propose to discuss heavy menstrual bleeding and the need for a change in the SmPC in the PRAC. 
Whether or not it will be included in the product information, it will be important to communicate 
that postmenopausal bleeding and longer-lasting menstrual disorders in premenopausal women must 
continue to be a trigger for presentation to the gynaecologist and further investigation.

4.5.  Updated Rapporteurs recommendation 
In the view of the PRAC Co-Rapporteur, most currently available studies are subject to multiple 
biases and are not capable to provide evidence of an association between heavy menstrual 
bleeding and Spikevax. Various menstrual disorders, not only heavy menstrual bleeding, have been 
reported. Besides, there is no evidence that menstrual changes occur specifically with mRNA 
vaccines. 
The MAH is kindly asked to provide a follow-up of available data in subsequent PSURs. 
We propose to discuss the issue of heavy menstrual bleeding and the need for a change in the 
SmPC in the PRAC. Whether or not it will be included in the product information, it will be 
important to communicate that postmenopausal bleeding and longer-lasting menstrual disorders in 
premenopausal women must continue to be a trigger for presentation to the gynaecologist and 
further investigation. 
4.6.  Adopted PRAC recommendation 
Having considered all the available evidence including spontaneous case reports in EudraVigilance, 
data from national reviews, observational studies, and provided by the Marketing Authorisation 
Holder (MAH), the PRAC has agreed that the MAH for COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (nucleoside-
modified) Spikevax (Moderna Biotech Spain, S.L.) should submit by 25 November 2022 a variation 
to amend the product information as described below (new text underlined):

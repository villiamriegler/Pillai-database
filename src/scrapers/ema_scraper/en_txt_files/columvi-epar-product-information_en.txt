CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Columvi as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory 
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), after two or more lines of systemic therapy. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Columvi must only be administered under the supervision of a healthcare professional experienced in 
the diagnosis and treatment of cancer patients and who has access to appropriate medical support to 
manage severe reactions associated with cytokine release syndrome (CRS). 
At least 1 dose of tocilizumab for use in the event of CRS must be available prior to Columvi infusion 
at Cycles 1 and 2. Access to an additional dose of tocilizumab within 8 hours of use of the previous 
tocilizumab dose must be ensured (see section 4.4). 
Pre-treatment with obinutuzumab 
All patients in study NP30179 received a single 1 000 mg dose of obinutuzumab as pre-treatment on 
Cycle 1 Day 1 (7 days prior to initiation of Columvi treatment) to lower the circulating and lymphoid 
B cells (see Table 2, Delayed or Missed Doses, and section 5.1).

Obinutuzumab was administered as an intravenous infusion at 50 mg/h. The rate of infusion was 
escalated in 50 mg/h increments every 30 minutes to a maximum of 400 mg/h. 
Refer to the obinutuzumab prescribing information for complete information on premedication, 
preparation, administration and management of adverse reactions of obinutuzumab. 
Premedication and prophylaxis 
Cytokine release syndrome prophylaxis  
Columvi should be administered to well-hydrated patients. Recommended premedication for CRS (see 
section 4.4) is outlined in Table 1.

Patient monitoring 
• 
All patients must be monitored for signs and symptoms of potential CRS during infusion and for 
at least 10 hours after completion of the infusion of the first Columvi dose (2.5 mg on Cycle 1 
Day 8) (see section 4.8). 
• 
Patients who experienced Grade ≥ 2 CRS with their previous infusion should be monitored after 
completion of the infusion (see Table 3 in section 4.2). 
All patients must be counselled on the risk, signs and symptoms of CRS and advised to contact the 
healthcare provider immediately should they experience signs and symptoms of CRS (see section 4.4). 
Duration of treatment 
Treatment with Columvi is recommended for a maximum of 12 cycles or until disease progression or 
unmanageable toxicity. Each cycle is 21 days. 
Delayed or missed doses 
During step-up dosing (weekly dosing): 
• 
Following pre-treatment with obinutuzumab, if the Columvi 2.5 mg dose is delayed by more 
than 1 week, then repeat pre-treatment with obinutuzumab. 
• 
• 
Following Columvi 2.5 mg dose or 10 mg dose, if there is a Columvi treatment-free interval of 
2 weeks to 6 weeks, then repeat the last tolerated Columvi dose and resume the planned step-up 
dosing. 
Following Columvi 2.5 mg dose or 10 mg dose, if there is a Columvi treatment-free interval of 
more than 6 weeks, then repeat pre-treatment with obinutuzumab and Columvi step-up dosing 
(see Cycle 1 in Table 2). 
After Cycle 2 (30 mg dose):  
• 
If there is a Columvi treatment-free interval of more than 6 weeks between cycles, then repeat 
pre-treatment with obinutuzumab and Columvi step-up dosing (see Cycle 1 in Table 2), and 
then resume the planned treatment cycle (30 mg dose). 
Dose modifications 
No dose reductions of Columvi are recommended.

5 In Study NP30179, Grade ≥ 2 CRS following Columvi 10 mg dose at Cycle 1 Day 15 occurred in 5.2% of 
patients, with a median time to onset of 26.2 hours from the start of infusion (range: 6.7 to 144.2 hours). 
6 In Study NP30179, Grade ≥ 2 CRS following Columvi 30 mg dose at Cycle 2 Day 1 occurred in one patient 
(0.8%), with a time to onset of 15.0 hours from the start of infusion. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is required in patients 65 years of age and older (see section 5.2). 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > upper limit 
of normal [ULN] to ≤ 1.5 × ULN or aspartate transaminase [AST] > ULN). Columvi has not been 
studied in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (CrCL 30 to 
< 90 mL/min). Columvi has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (see 
section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Columvi in children below 18 years of age have not been established. No 
data are available. 
Method of administration  
Columvi is for intravenous use only. 
Columvi must be diluted by a healthcare professional using aseptic technique, prior to intravenous 
administration. It must be administered as an intravenous infusion through a dedicated infusion line.  
Columvi must not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus. 
For instructions on dilution of Columvi before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to obinutuzumab, or to any of the excipients listed in 
section 6.1. 
For specific contraindications on obinutuzumab, please refer to the obinutuzumab prescribing 
information. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
CD20-negative disease 
There are limited data available on patients with CD20-negative DLBCL treated with Columvi and it 
is possible that patients with CD20-negative DLBCL may have less benefit compared to patients with 
CD20-positive DLBCL. The potential risks and benefits associated with treatment of patients with 
CD20-negative DLBCL with Columvi should be considered. 
Cytokine release syndrome 
CRS, including life-threatening reactions, has been reported in patients receiving Columvi (see 
section 4.8).  
The most common manifestations of CRS were pyrexia, tachycardia, hypotension, chills and hypoxia. 
Infusion-related reactions may be clinically indistinguishable from manifestations of CRS. 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Most CRS events occurred following the first dose of Columvi. Elevated liver function tests (AST and 
alanine transaminase [ALT] > 3 × ULN and/or total bilirubin > 2 × ULN) concurrent with CRS have 
been reported after Columvi use (see section 4.8). 
Patients in study NP30179 were pre-treated with obinutuzumab, 7 days prior to initiation of Columvi 
therapy, and patients should be premedicated with an anti-pyretic, antihistamine and a glucocorticoid 
(see section 4.2).  
At least 1 dose of tocilizumab for use in the event of CRS must be available prior to Columvi infusion 
at Cycles 1 and 2. Access to an additional dose of tocilizumab within 8 hours of use of the previous 
tocilizumab dose must be ensured. 
Patients must be monitored during all Columvi infusions and for at least 10 hours after completion of 
the first infusion. For complete information on monitoring, see section 4.2. Patients must be 
counselled to seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms of CRS occur at any time 
(see Patient card below). 
Patients should be evaluated for other causes of fever, hypoxia and hypotension, such as infections or 
sepsis. CRS should be managed based on the patient’s clinical presentation and according to the CRS 
management guidance provided in Table 3 (section 4.2).  
Patient card 
The prescriber must inform the patient of the risk of CRS and signs and symptoms of CRS. Patients 
must be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they experience signs and symptoms of 
CRS. Patients should be provided with the patient card and instructed to carry the card at all times. 
This card describes symptoms of CRS which, if experienced, should prompt the patient to seek 
immediate medical attention.  
Interaction with CYP450 substrates 
The initial release of cytokines associated with the start of Columvi treatment could suppress CYP450 
enzymes and lead to fluctuations in concentrations of concomitantly administered drugs. On initiation 
of Columvi therapy, patients being treated with CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index 
should be monitored as fluctuations in the concentration of concomitant drugs may lead to toxicity, 
loss of effect or adverse events (see section 4.5). 
Serious infections 
Serious infections (such as sepsis and pneumonia) have occurred in patients treated with Columvi (see 
section 4.8).  
Columvi must not be administered to patients with an active infection. Caution should be exercised 
when considering the use of Columvi in patients with a history of chronic or recurrent infection, those 
with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infections, or those who have had significant 
prior immunosuppressive treatment. Patients should be monitored before and during Columvi 
treatment for the emergence of possible bacterial, fungal, and new or reactivated viral infections and 
treated appropriately.  
Columvi should be temporarily withheld in the presence of an active infection until the infection has 
resolved. Patients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms suggestive of an 
infection occur.  
Febrile neutropenia has been reported during treatment with Columvi. Patients with febrile 
neutropenia should be evaluated for infection and treated promptly. 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Tumour flare 
Tumour flare has been reported in patients receiving Columvi (see section 4.8). Manifestations 
included localised pain and swelling. 
Consistent with the mechanism of action of Columvi, tumour flare is likely due to the influx of T cells 
into tumour sites following Columvi administration and may mimic progression of disease. Tumour 
flare does not imply treatment failure or represent tumour progression. 
Specific risk factors for tumour flare have not been identified, however, there is a heightened risk of 
compromise and morbidity due to mass effect secondary to tumour flare in patients with bulky 
tumours located in close proximity to airways and/or a vital organ. Monitoring and evaluation for 
tumour flare at critical anatomical sites is recommended in patients treated with Columvi and managed 
as clinically indicated. Corticosteroids and analgesics should be considered to treat tumour flare. 
Tumour lysis syndrome 
Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) has been reported in patients receiving Columvi (see section 4.8). 
Patients with high tumour burden, rapidly proliferative tumours, renal dysfunction or dehydration are 
at greater risk of tumour lysis syndrome.  
Patients at risk should be monitored closely by appropriate laboratory and clinical tests for electrolyte 
status, hydration and renal function. Appropriate prophylactic measures with anti-hyperuricaemics 
(e.g., allopurinol or rasburicase) and adequate hydration should be considered prior to obinutuzumab 
pre-treatment and prior to Columvi infusion. 
Management of TLS may include aggressive hydration, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, 
anti-hyperuricaemic therapy and supportive care. 
Immunisation 
The safety of immunisation with live vaccines during or following Columvi therapy has not been 
studied. Immunisation with live vaccines is not recommended during Columvi therapy.  
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. No interactions with Columvi are expected via the 
cytochrome P450 enzymes, other metabolizing enzymes or transporters.   
The initial release of cytokines associated with the start of Columvi treatment could suppress CYP450 
enzymes. The highest drug-drug interaction risk is during the period of one week following each of the 
first 2 doses of Columvi (i.e., Cycle 1 Day 8 and 15) in patients who are receiving concomitant 
CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., warfarin, cyclosporine). On initiation of 
Columvi therapy, patients being treated with CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index 
should be monitored.  
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception  
Female patients of childbearing potential must use highly effective contraceptive methods during 
treatment with Columvi and for at least 2 months following the last dose of Columvi. 
Pregnancy 
There are no data on the use of Columvi in pregnant women. No reproductive toxicity studies have 
been performed in animals (see section 5.3).  
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Glofitamab is an immunoglobulin G (IgG). IgG is known to cross the placenta. Based on its 
mechanism of action, glofitamab is likely to cause foetal B cell depletion when administered to a 
pregnant woman.  
Columvi is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using 
contraception. Female patients receiving Columvi should be advised of the potential harm to the 
foetus. Female patients should be advised to contact the treating physician, should pregnancy occur. 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether glofitamab is excreted in human milk. No studies have been conducted to 
assess the impact of glofitamab on milk production or its presence in breast milk. Human IgG is 
known to be present in human milk. The potential for absorption of glofitamab and the potential for 
adverse reactions in the breast-feeding child is unknown. Women should be advised to discontinue 
breast-feeding during treatment with Columvi and for 2 months after the final dose of Columvi.  
Fertility 
No human data on fertility are available. No fertility assessments in animals have been performed to 
evaluate the effect of glofitamab on fertility (see section 5.3).  
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Columvi has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients experiencing 
symptoms of neurological adverse events and/or CRS (pyrexia, tachycardia, hypotension, chills, 
hypoxia) should be advised not to drive or use machines until symptoms resolve (see sections 4.4 and 
4.8). 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most common adverse reactions (≥ 20%) were cytokine release syndrome, neutropenia, anaemia,  
thrombocytopenia, and rash.  
The most common serious adverse reactions reported in ≥ 2% of patients were cytokine release 
syndrome (22.1%), sepsis (4.1%), COVID-19 (3.4%), tumour flare (3.4%), COVID-19 pneumonia 
(2.8%), febrile neutropenia (2.1%), neutropenia (2.1%), and pleural effusion (2.1%). 
Permanent discontinuation of Columvi due to an adverse reaction occurred in 5.5% of patients. The 
most common adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation of Columvi were COVID-19 
(1.4%) and neutropenia (1.4%). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions occurring in relapsed or refractory DLBCL patients treated with Columvi 
monotherapy (n=145) in study NP30179 are listed in Table 4. Patients received a median of 5 cycles 
of Columvi treatment (range: 1 to 13 cycles). 
The adverse reactions are listed by MedDRA system organ class and categories of frequency. The 
following categories of frequency have been used: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to 
< 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000), very rare (< 1/10 000). 
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing 
seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Cytokine release syndrome  
In study NP30179, any grade CRS (by ASTCT criteria) occurred in 67.6% of patients, with Grade 1 
CRS being reported in 50.3% of patients, Grade 2 CRS in 13.1% patients, Grade 3 CRS in 2.8% of 
patients and Grade 4 CRS in 1.4% of patients. CRS occurred more than once in 32.4% (47/145) of 
patients; 36/47 patients experienced multiple Grade 1 CRS events only. There were no fatal cases of 
CRS. CRS resolved in all patients except one. One patient discontinued treatment due to CRS. 
In patients with CRS, the most common manifestations of CRS included pyrexia (99.0%), tachycardia 
(25.5%), hypotension (23.5%), chills (14.3%) and hypoxia (12.2%). Grade 3 or higher events 
associated with CRS included hypotension (3.1%), hypoxia (3.1%), pyrexia (2.0%) and tachycardia 
(2.0%).  
CRS of any grade occurred in 54.5% of patients following the first 2.5 mg dose of Columvi at Cycle 1 
Day 8 with median time to onset (from start of infusion) of 12.6 hours (range: 5.2 to 50.8 hours) and 
median duration of 31.8 hours (range: 0.5 to 316.7 hours); in 33.3% of patients following the 10 mg 
dose at Cycle 1 Day 15 with median time to onset of 26.8 hours (range: 6.7 to 125.0 hours) and 
median duration of 16.5 hours (range: 0.3 to 109.2 hours); and in 26.8% of patients following the 
30 mg dose at Cycle 2 with median time to onset of 28.2 hours (range: 15.0 to 44.2 hours) and median 
duration of 18.9 hours (range: 1.0 to 180.5 hours). CRS was reported in 0.9% of patients at Cycle 3 
and in 2% of patients beyond Cycle 3. 
Grade ≥ 2 CRS occurred in 12.4% of patients following the first Columvi dose (2.5 mg) with median 
time to onset of 9.7 hours (range: 5.2 to 19.1 hours) and median duration of 50.4 hours (range: 6.5 to 
316.7 hours). Following Columvi 10 mg dose at Cycle 1 Day 15, the incidence of Grade ≥ 2 CRS 
decreased to 5.2% of patients with median time to onset of 26.2 hours (range: 6.7 to 144.2 hours) and 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
median duration of 30.9 hours (range: 3.7 to 227.2 hours). Grade ≥ 2 CRS following Columvi 30 mg 
dose at Cycle 2 Day 1 occurred in one patient (0.8%) with time to onset of 15.0 hours and duration of 
44.8 hours. No Grade ≥ 2 CRS was reported beyond Cycle 2. 
In 145 patients, 7 (4.8%) patients experienced elevated liver function tests (AST and ALT > 3 × ULN 
and/or total bilirubin > 2 × ULN) reported concurrently with CRS (n=6) or with disease progression 
(n=1). 
Among the 25 patients who experienced Grade ≥ 2 CRS after Columvi, 22 (88.0%) received 
tocilizumab, 15 (60.0%) received corticosteroids and 14 (56.0%) received both tocilizumab and 
corticosteroids. Ten patients (40.0%) received oxygen. All 6 patients (24.0%) with Grade 3 or 4 CRS 
received a single vasopressor. 
Hospitalisations due to patients experiencing CRS following Columvi administration occurred in 
22.1% of patients and the reported median duration of hospitalisation was 4 days (range: 2 to 15 days). 
Serious infections 
In study NP30179, serious infections were reported in 15.9% of patients. The most frequent serious 
infections reported in ≥ 2% of patients were sepsis (4.1%), COVID-19 (3.4%), and COVID-19 
pneumonia (2.8%). Infection-related deaths were reported in 4.8% of patients (due to sepsis, 
COVID-19 pneumonia and COVID-19). Four patients (2.8%) experienced serious infections 
concurrently with Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. 
Neutropenia  
Neutropenia (including neutrophil count decreased) was reported in 40.0% of patients and severe 
neutropenia (Grade 3 or 4) was reported in 29.0% of patients. The median time to onset of the first 
neutropenia event was 29 days (range: 1 to 203 days). Prolonged neutropenia (lasting longer than 
30 days) occurred in 11.7% of patients. The majority of patients with neutropenia (79.3%) were 
treated with G-CSF. Febrile neutropenia was reported in 3.4% of patients. 
Tumour flare 
Tumour flare was reported in 11.7% of patients, including Grade 2 tumour flare in 4.8% of patients 
and Grade 3 tumour flare in 2.8% of patients. Tumour flare was reported involving lymph nodes in the 
head and neck presenting with pain and involving lymph nodes in the thorax with symptoms of 
breathlessness due to development of pleural effusion. Most tumour flare events (16/17) occurred 
during Cycle 1, and no tumour flare events were reported beyond Cycle 2. The median time to onset of 
tumour flare of any grade was 2 days (range: 1 to 16 days), and the median duration was 3.5 days 
(range: 1 to 35 days).  
Among the 11 patients who experienced Grade ≥ 2 tumour flare, 2 (18.2%) patients received 
analgesics, 6 (54.5%) patients received corticosteroids and analgesics including morphine derivatives, 
1 (9.1%) patient received corticosteroids and anti-emetics, and 2 (18.2%) patients did not require 
treatment. All tumour flare events resolved except in one patient with a Grade ≥ 2 event. No patients 
discontinued treatment due to tumour flare. 
Tumour lysis syndrome  
TLS was reported in 2 patients (1.4%) and was Grade 3 in severity in both cases. The median time to 
onset of TLS onset was 2 days, and the median duration was 4 days (range: 3 to 5 days). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.9  Overdose 
There is no experience with overdose in clinical trials.  In case of overdose, patients should be closely 
monitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions, and appropriate symptomatic treatment 
instituted.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, other monoclonal antibodies and antibody drug 
conjugates, ATC code: L01FX28 
Mechanism of action 
Glofitamab is a bispecific monoclonal antibody that binds bivalently to CD20 expressed on the surface 
of B cells and monovalently to CD3 in the T-cell receptor complex expressed on the surface of T cells. 
By simultaneous binding to CD20 on the B cell and CD3 on the T cell, glofitamab mediates the 
formation of an immunological synapse with subsequent T-cell activation and proliferation, secretion 
of cytokines and release of cytolytic proteins that results in the lysis of CD20-expressing B cells. 
Pharmacodynamics 
In Study NP30179, 84% (84/100) patients were already B cell depleted (< 70 cells/µL) before pre-
treatment with obinutuzumab. B cell depletion increased to 100% (94/94) after obinutuzumab pre-
treatment prior to Columvi treatment initiation and remained low during Columvi treatment.  
During Cycle 1 (step-up dosing), transient increases in plasma IL-6 levels were observed at 6 hours 
post Columvi infusion, which remained elevated at 20 hours post-infusion and returned to baseline 
prior to the next infusion.  
Cardiac electrophysiology 
In Study NP30179, 16/145 patients who were exposed to glofitamab experienced a post-baseline QTc 
value > 450ms. One of these cases was assessed to be of clinical significance by the investigator. No 
patients discontinued treatment due to QTc prolongation. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Relapsed or refractory DLBCL 
An open-label multicenter, multi-cohort trial (NP30179) was conducted to evaluate Columvi in 
patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In the single-arm monotherapy 
DLBCL cohort (n=108), patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL were required to have received at 
least two prior lines of systemic therapy, including an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody and an 
anthracycline agent. Patients with FL3b and Richter transformation were not eligible. Patients were 
expected to present CD20-positive DLBCL, but biomarker eligibility was not a requirement for 
inclusion (see section 4.4). 
The study excluded patients with ECOG performance status ≥ 2, significant cardiovascular disease 
(such as New York Heart Association Class III or IV cardiac disease, myocardial infarction within the 
last 6 months, unstable arrhythmias, or unstable angina), significant active pulmonary disease, 
impaired renal functions (CrCL < 50 mL/min with elevated serum creatinine level), active 
autoimmune disease requiring immunosuppressive therapy, active infections (i.e., chronic active EBV, 
acute or chronic hepatitis C, hepatitis B, HIV), progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, current or 
a history of CNS lymphoma or CNS disease, a history of macrophage activation syndrome / 
hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, prior allogeneic stem cell transplant, prior organ transplantation, 
or hepatic transaminases ≥ 3 × ULN. 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
All patients received pre-treatment with obinutuzumab at Cycle 1 Day 1. Patients received 2.5 mg of 
Columvi at Cycle 1 Day 8, 10 mg of Columvi at Cycle 1 Day 15, and 30 mg of Columvi at Cycle 2 
Day 1 as per the step-up dosing schedule. Patients continued to receive 30 mg of Columvi on Day 1 of 
Cycles 3 to 12. The duration of each cycle was 21 days. Patients received a median of 5 cycles of 
Columvi treatment (range: 1 to 13 cycles) with 34.7% receiving 8 or more cycles and 25.7% receiving 
12 cycles of Columvi treatment. 
The baseline demographic and disease characteristics were: median age 66 years (range: 21 to 
90 years) with 53.7% being 65 years or older and 15.7% being 75 years or older; 69.4% males; 74.1% 
white, 5.6% Asian and 0.9% Black or African American; 5.6% Hispanic or Latino; and ECOG 
performance status of 0 (46.3%) or 1 (52.8%). Most patients (71.3%) had DLBCL not otherwise 
specified, 7.4% had DLBCL transformed from follicular lymphoma, 8.3% had high grade B-cell 
lymphoma (HGBCL) or another histology transformed from follicular lymphoma, 7.4% had HGBCL, 
and 5.6% had primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL). The median number of prior lines of 
therapy was 3 (range: 2 to 7), with 39.8% of patients having received 2 prior lines and 60.2% having 
received 3 or more prior lines of therapy. All patients had received prior chemotherapy (all patients 
received alkylator therapy and 98.1% of patients received anthracycline therapy) and all patients had 
received prior anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody therapy; 35.2% of patients had received prior 
CAR T-cell therapy, and 16.7% of patients had received autologous stem cell transplant. Most patients 
(89.8%) had refractory disease, 60.2% of patients had primary refractory disease and 83.3% of patients 
were refractory to their last prior therapy. 
The primary efficacy outcome measure was complete response (CR) rate as assessed by an 
independent review committee (IRC) using 2014 Lugano criteria. The overall median duration of 
follow-up was 15 months (range: 0 to 21 months). The secondary efficacy outcome measures included 
overall response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), duration of complete response (DOCR), and 
time to first complete response (TFCR) as assessed by IRC. 
Efficacy results are summarized in Table 5.

Immunogenicity 
Of 418 patients in study NP30179, only two (0.5%) patients were negative for anti-glofitamab 
antibodies at baseline and became positive following treatment. Due to the limited number of patients 
with antibodies against glofitamab, no conclusions can be drawn concerning a potential effect of 
immunogenicity on efficacy or safety. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Columvi in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in treatment of mature B-cell neoplasms. 
(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
Conditional approval  
This medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called ‘conditional approval’ scheme.  
This means that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited.  
The European Medicines Agency will review new information on this medicinal product at least every 
year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Non-compartmental analyses indicate that glofitamab serum concentration reaches the maximal level 
(Cmax) at the end of infusion and declines in a bi-exponential fashion. Glofitamab exhibits linear and 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
dose-proportional pharmacokinetics over the dose range studied (0.005 to 30 mg) and is independent 
of time.  
Absorption 
Columvi is administered as an intravenous infusion. Peak concentration of glofitamab (Cmax) was 
reached at the end of the infusion. 
Distribution 
Following intravenous administration, the central volume of distribution was 3.33 L, which is close to 
total serum volume. The peripheral volume of distribution was 2.18 L. 
Biotransformation 
The metabolism of glofitamab has not been studied. Antibodies are cleared principally by catabolism. 
Elimination 
The glofitamab serum concentration-time data are described by a population pharmacokinetic model 
with two compartments, and both time-independent clearance and time-varying clearance. 
The time-independent clearance pathway was estimated as 0.602 L/day and the initial time-varying 
clearance pathway as 0.396 L/day, with an exponential decay over time (Kdes ~ 0.445/day). The 
estimated decay half-life from the initial total clearance value to the time-independent clearance only 
was estimated as 1.56 days. 
The effective half-life in the linear phase (i.e., after the contribution of time-varying clearance has 
collapsed to a negligible amount) is 6.54 days (95% CI: 3.74, 9.41) based on the population 
pharmacokinetic analysis.   
Special populations 
Elderly 
No differences in glofitamab exposure were noted in patients 65 years of age and older and those 
under 65 years based on population pharmacokinetic analysis. 
Renal impairment 
The population pharmacokinetic analysis of glofitamab showed that creatinine clearance does not 
affect the pharmacokinetics of glofitamab. The pharmacokinetics of glofitamab in patients with mild 
or moderate renal impairment (CrCL 30 to < 90 mL/min) were similar to those in patients with normal 
renal function. Columvi has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment.  
Hepatic impairment 
Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed mild hepatic impairment does not affect the 
pharmacokinetics of glofitamab. The pharmacokinetics of glofitamab in patients with mild hepatic 
impairment (total bilirubin > ULN to ≤ 1.5 × ULN or AST > ULN) were similar to those with normal 
hepatic functions. Columvi has not been studied in patients with moderate or severe hepatic 
impairment. 
Effects of age, gender and body weight 
No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of glofitamab were observed based on 
age (21 years to 90 years), gender and body weight (31 kg to 148 kg). 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
No studies have been conducted to establish the carcinogenic potential and mutagenic potential of 
glofitamab. 
Fertility 
No fertility assessments in animals have been performed to evaluate the effect of glofitamab. 
Reproductive toxicity 
No reproductive and developmental toxicity studies in animals have been performed to evaluate the 
effect of glofitamab. Based on low placental transfer of antibodies during the first trimester, the 
mechanism of action of glofitamab (B cell depletion, target-dependent T cell activation, and cytokine 
release), the available safety data with glofitamab and data on other anti-CD20 antibodies, the risk for 
teratogenicity is low. Prolonged B cell depletion can lead to increased risk of opportunistic infection, 
which may cause foetal loss. Transient CRS associated with Columvi administration may also be 
harmful to the foetus (see section 4.6). 
Systemic toxicity 
In a study in cynomolgus monkeys, animals experiencing severe CRS after a single intravenous dose 
of glofitamab (0.1 mg/kg) without obinutuzumab pre-treatment had erosions in the gastrointestinal 
tract and inflammatory cell infiltrates in spleen and sinusoids of the liver and sporadically in some 
other organs. These inflammatory cell infiltrates were likely secondary to cytokine-induced immune 
cell activation. Pre-treatment with obinutuzumab resulted in the attenuation of glofitamab-induced 
cytokine release and related adverse effects by depleting B cells in peripheral blood and lymphoid 
tissue. This allowed at least 10 times higher doses of glofitamab (1 mg/kg) in cynomolgus monkeys 
resulting in a Cmax of up to 3.74 times the human Cmax at the recommended 30 mg dose.  
All findings with glofitamab were considered pharmacologically mediated effects and reversible. 
Studies longer than 4 weeks were not performed, as glofitamab was highly immunogenic in 
cynomolgus monkeys and led to loss of exposure and loss of the pharmacologic effect. 
As all relapsed or refractory DLBCL patients to be treated have been exposed to anti-CD20 treatment 
before, the majority will likely have low circulating B cell levels due to residual effects of prior anti-
CD20 therapy, before treatment with obinutuzumab. Therefore, the animal model without prior 
rituximab (or other anti-CD20) treatment may not fully reflect the clinical context.

1.  What Columvi is and what it is used for 
What Columvi is 
Columvi is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance glofitamab. 
What Columvi is used for 
Columvi is used to treat adults with a cancer called “diffuse large B-cell lymphoma” (DLBCL). It is 
used when the cancer: 
• 
• 
has come back (relapsed), or  
did not respond to previous treatments.  
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is a cancer of a part of your immune system (the body’s defences). 
• 
• 
It affects a type of white blood cell called ‘B cells’.  
In DLBCL, B cells multiply in an uncontrolled manner and build up in your tissues. 
How Columvi works 
• 
The active substance in Columvi, glofitamab, is a bispecific monoclonal antibody, a type of 
protein that attaches to two specific targets in the body. It attaches to a specific protein on the 
surface of B cells, including cancerous B cells, and also to another protein on the surface of T 
cells (another type of white blood cell). This activates T cells and causes them to multiply. This, 
in turn, results in the destruction of the B cells, including the cancerous cells. 
34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  What you need to know before you are given Columvi  
You must not be given Columvi 
• 
• 
if you are allergic to glofitamab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6) 
if you are allergic to obinutuzumab, which is another medicine given before starting Columvi 
treatment (see also section 3 ‘How Columvi is given’), or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine 
If you are not sure if any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given 
Columvi. 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor before you are given Columvi if 
• 
• 
you have an infection 
you have had a long-lasting infection (chronic), or an infection which keeps coming back 
(recurring)  
you have or had any kidney, liver or heart problems  
you are planning to have a vaccine in the near future 
• 
• 
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor before being given Columvi.  
Pay attention to serious side effects.  
Some side effects of Columvi are serious and can be life-threatening. These may happen any time 
during Columvi treatment. 
Tell your doctor straight away if you experience any of the following side effects while receiving 
Columvi. The symptoms of each side effect are listed in section 4. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Cytokine release syndrome: an exaggerated inflammatory condition associated with medicines 
that stimulate T cells, characterized by fever and impairment to multiple organs in the body. 
Cytokine release syndrome is more likely to occur during Cycle 1 after Columvi is given (see 
section 3 ‘How Columvi is given’). Close monitoring is needed. Before each infusion, you may 
be given medicines, which help reduce possible side effects of cytokine release syndrome.  
Tumour lysis syndrome: some people may get unusual levels of some salts in the blood (such 
as potassium and uric acid) – caused by the fast breakdown of cancer cells during treatment. 
Your doctor or nurse will do blood tests to check for this condition. Before each infusion, you 
should be well-hydrated and may be given medicines that can help reduce high levels of uric 
acid. These may help reduce possible side effects of tumour lysis syndrome. 
Tumour flare: a reaction to certain medicines that act on the immune system which is/appears 
similar to worsening of the cancer. 
Infections: you may get signs of infection, which can vary depending on where in the body the 
infection is. 
If you have, or think you may have, any of the above symptoms tell your doctor straight away.  
Your doctor may:  
• 
• 
• 
give you other medicines to reduce symptoms and prevent complications, 
stop your treatment for a short time, or  
stop your treatment completely.  
Children and adolescents 
This medicine should not be given to children and adolescents below 18 years of age. This is because 
Columvi has not been studied in this age group. 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Other medicines and Columvi 
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might start taking any other 
medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines.  
Pregnancy and contraception 
• 
• 
• 
• 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor 
for advice before taking this medicine. 
You should not be given Columvi if you are pregnant. This is because it is possible that Columvi 
could harm your unborn baby. 
If you could become pregnant, you must use effective contraception while you are being treated 
with Columvi and for 2 months after the last dose. 
If you become pregnant while you are being treated with Columvi tell your doctor immediately. 
Breast-feeding 
Do not breast-feed while receiving Columvi and for at least 2 months after the last dose. This is 
because it is not known if this medicine can pass into breast milk and harm your baby. 
Driving and using machines 
Columvi has minor influence on your ability to drive, cycle or use any tools or machines.  
If you feel any symptoms that may affect your ability to drive, including symptoms of cytokine release 
syndrome (such as fever, fast heartbeat, feeling dizzy or lightheaded, chills or shortness of breath) – do 
not drive, cycle or use any tools or machines until you feel better. See section 4 for more information 
about side effects. 
3. 
How Columvi is given 
You will be given Columvi under the supervision of a doctor experienced in cancer treatment, in a 
hospital or clinic. 
Medicines given before Columvi treatment 
• 
• 
Seven days before starting Columvi treatment, you will be given another medicine, 
obinutuzumab, to reduce the number of B cells in your blood.  
30 to 60 minutes before you are given Columvi, you may be given other medicines 
(pre-medication) to help reduce reactions associated with cytokine release syndrome. These 
medicines may include: 
- 
- 
- 
A corticosteroid such as dexamethasone 
A fever-reducing medicine such as paracetamol 
An antihistamine such as diphenhydramine 
How much and how often you will receive Columvi  
You may be given up to 12 treatment cycles of Columvi. Each cycle lasts 21 days. During the first two 
cycles, your doctor will begin Columvi treatment with a low dose and will gradually increase it to the 
full dose. 
A typical schedule is shown below.  
Cycle 1: This will include a pre-treatment and 2 low doses of Columvi during the 21 days: 
• 
Day 1 – Pre-treatment with obinutuzumab 
36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
Day 8 – 2.5 mg starting dose of Columvi 
Day 15 – 10 mg intermediate dose of Columvi 
Cycle 2 to Cycle 12: This will be just one dose in the 21 days: 
• 
Day 1 – 30 mg full dose of Columvi 
How Columvi is given and monitoring 
Columvi is given as a drip into a vein (an intravenous infusion). Your doctor will adjust the time 
required for infusion depending on how you respond to treatment. 
• 
Your first infusion will be given over 4 hours. Your doctor will monitor you carefully during the 
first infusion and for 10 hours after completion of infusion. This is to watch for any signs or 
symptoms of cytokine release syndrome.  
For following infusions, your doctor may require to monitor you after completion of infusion. 
This will be necessary if you have had moderate or severe cytokine release syndrome with your 
previous dose. 
If you do not have any cytokine release syndrome after 3 doses, your doctor may give the 
following infusions over 2 hours. 
• 
• 
If you miss a dose of Columvi 
If you miss an appointment, make another one straight away. For the treatment to be fully effective, it 
is very important not to miss a dose. 
Before stopping Columvi treatment 
Speak with your doctor before stopping treatment. This is because stopping treatment may make your 
condition worse. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse.

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
Columvi must be administered as an intravenous infusion through a dedicated infusion line. It must 
not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus. 
For instructions on dilution of Columvi before administration, see below. 
Instructions for dilution 
• 
• 
Columvi contains no preservative and is intended for single use only 
Columvi must be diluted by a healthcare professional using aseptic technique, prior to 
intravenous administration. 
Do not shake the vial. Visually inspect the Columvi vial for particulate matter or discoloration 
prior to administration. Columvi is a colorless, clear solution. Discard the vial if the solution is 
cloudy, discolored or contains visible particles. 
Withdraw the appropriate volume of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection or 
sodium chloride 4.5 mg/mL (0.45%) solution for injection, as described in Table 1, from the 
infusion bag using a sterile needle and syringe and discard. 
Withdraw the required volume of Columvi concentrate for the intended dose from the vial using 
a sterile needle and syringe and dilute into the infusion bag (see Table 1 below). Discard any 
unused portion left in the vial. 
The final glofitamab concentration after dilution must be 0.1 mg/mL to 0.6 mg/mL. 
Gently invert the infusion bag to mix the solution in order to avoid excessive foaming. Do not 
shake. 
Inspect the infusion bag for particulates and discard if present. 
Prior to the start of the intravenous infusion, the content of the infusion bag should be at room 
temperature (25°C).

Only sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) or 4.5 mg/mL (0.45%) solution for injection should be used to 
dilute Columvi, since other solvents have not been tested. 
When diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection, Columvi is compatible 
with intravenous infusion bags composed of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene (PE), 
polypropylene (PP) or non-PVC polyolefin. When diluted with sodium chloride 4.5 mg/mL (0.45%) 
solution for injection, Columvi is compatible with intravenous infusion bags composed of PVC. 
No incompatibilities have been observed with infusion sets with product-contacting surfaces of 
polyurethane (PUR), PVC or PE, and in-line filter membranes composed of polyethersulfone (PES) or 
polysulfone. The use of in-line filter membranes is optional.

Diluted solution for intravenous infusion 
Chemical and physical in-use stability have been demonstrated for a maximum of 72 hours at 2 °C to 
8 °C and 24 hours at 30 °C followed by a maximum infusion time of 8 hours. 
From a microbiological point of view, the diluted solution should be used immediately. If not used 
immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and 
would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2 °C to 8 °C, unless dilution has taken place in 
controlled and validated aseptic conditions. 
Disposal 
Columvi vial is for single use only. 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.

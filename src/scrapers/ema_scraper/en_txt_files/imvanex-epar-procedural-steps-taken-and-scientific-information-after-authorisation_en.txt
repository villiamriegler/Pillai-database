are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Imvanex was compared to ACAM2000 (a 'second 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
generation' live attenuated smallpox vaccine produced in 
cell culture and licenced in the United States of America) in 
a randomized, open-label non-inferiority clinical trial in 
healthy adults (US military personnel) aged 18 to 42 years 
and who were naïve to smallpox vaccine (Study POX-MVA-
006).   
A total of 433 subjects were randomized in a 1 : 1 ratio to 
receive either two doses of Imvanex followed by a single 
dose of ACAM2000 at four weeks intervals or to receive a 
single dose of ACAM2000. ACAM2000 was administered via 
Page 14/25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
scarification.  
The first co-primary endpoint compared vaccinia-specific 
neutralizing antibody responses at the peak visits (Day 42 
after first vaccination for Imvanex where the subjects 
received two doses according to the standard vaccination 
schedule and Day 28 for ACAM2000). Imvanex induced a 
peak neutralizing antibody geometric mean titer (GMT) of 
153.5 (n = 185; 95% CI 134.3, 175.6), which was non-
inferior to the GMT of 79.3 (n = 186; 95% CI 67.1, 93.8) 
obtained after scarification with ACAM2000.  
The second co-primary endpoint evaluated if vaccination 
with Imvanex (n = 165) prior to administration of 
ACAM2000 results in an attenuation of the cutaneous 
reaction to ACAM2000 (n = 161) as measured by maximum 
lesion area in mm2. At day 13-15, the median maximum 
lesion area for subjects who were administered ACAM2000 
was 75mm2 (95% CI 69.0, 85.0) and for those who 
received Imvanex it was 0.0 (95% CI 0.0, 2.0).

In the clinical study MVA-POX-013, three consecutive 
data from Study MVA-POX-013, a randomised, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial to 
evaluate immunogenicity and safety of three 
consecutive production lots of Imvanex (MVA-BN) 
smallpox vaccine in healthy vaccinia-naive subjects. 
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
The provision of the study report addresses the post-

production lots of IMVANEX (MVA-BN) are compared. The 
data suggest comparable performance between lots. The 
combined groups 1-3 included 2119 healthy subjects and 
the PRNT and ELISA seroconversion rates for the pooled 
vaccine lots were 99.8% (95% CI: 99.5; 99.9) and 99.7% 
(95% CI: 99.4; 99.9), respectively. Further, the MAH has 
submitted an analysis of the safety data from the 3,000 
subjects who were exposed across the three vaccine lots 
which were tested.  The rates of adverse events were 
generally consistent across the lots. No new safety 
concerns are raised based on the information provided.

Summary of risk management plan for Esperoct  
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Esperoct. The RMP details important risks of 
Esperoct, how these risks can be minimised and how more information will be obtained about risks and 
uncertainties (missing information) of Esperoct. 
The Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) of Esperoct and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Esperoct should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Esperoct should be read in the context of all this information including the 
assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part of the EPAR.  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in the RMP updates for Esperoct. 
I. 
The medicine and what it is used for  
Esperoct is authorised for treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients 12 years and above with 
haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency). It contains turoctocog alfa pegol as the active 
substance and it is given by intravenous route.  
Further information about the evaluation of benefits of Esperoct can be found in the EPAR for Esperoct, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s webpage:

II.  Risks associated with the medicine and activities to 
minimise or further characterise the risks  
Important risks of Esperoct, together with measures to minimise such risks and the studies for learning 
more about the risks of Esperoct, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
 
 
 
 
specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package 
leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals 
important advice on the medicine’s packaging 
the authorised pack size – the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly 
the medicine’s legal status – the way a medicine is supplied to the public (e.g., with or without 
prescription) can help to minimises its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse events is collected continuously and regularly 
analysed so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine 
pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Esperoct is not yet available, it is listed under 
‘missing information’ below. 
II.A  List of important risks and missing information  
Important risks of Esperoct are risks that need special risk management activities to further investigate 
or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. Important risks can be 
regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link 
with the use of Esperoct. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this 
medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs 
further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is 
currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine). An overview of 
important risks and missing information for Esperoct is provided below.

measures 
Theoretical considerations, literature and experience from marketed 
FVIII products on the market. 
The risk of inhibitor development is the highest in PUPs. In PUPs, the risk 
of developing inhibitors is highest within the first 20 exposure days. 
Several patient-related factors have been associated with the risk of 
developing inhibitors, such as FVIII gene mutation, other genetic factors, 
family history of inhibitors and ethnicity. Non-genetic risk factors include 
vaccinations, surgery and intensive treatment. 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
Routine risk communication: The identified risk of developing 
Inhibitors to FVIII is addressed in the labelling: Section 4.8 of the 
SmPC and Section 4 of the PL. 
Routine risk minimisation activities recommending specific clinical 
measures to address the risk: Recommendation for careful monitoring 
by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests is included in 
SmPC Section 4.4 and PL Section 2.

Clinical trials, literature and experience from marketed FVIII products. 
Patients with a history of allergic reactions or with known 
hypersensitivity to the active substance (rFVIII or PEG), to Chinese 
hamster proteins or to excipients are at higher risk. The risk of 
allergic/hypersensitivity reactions is expected to be higher with the initial 
administrations compared to subsequent administrations.

Important potential risks 
Long-term potential effects of PEG accumulation in the choroid plexus of the brain and other 
tissues/organs 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Theoretical considerations based on literature. 
There has been no indication of PEG accumulation after N8-GP treatment 
nonclinical or clinically. 
In the N8-GP chronic repeat dose toxicity studies in Rowett Nude Rats, 
no treatment-related histopathological changes or signs of PEG 
accumulation were seen in any organs. PEG was not detected in any 
brain tissues (including the choroid plexus) by a PEG-specific 
immunohistochemistry staining.  
Single-dose metabolism and excretion studies were performed in rats, 
with N8-GP radiolabelled in the PEG moiety. The excretion study showed 
that N8-GP/40 kDa PEG is excreted in urine and faeces. The distribution 
study in rats showed that PEG is gradually eliminated from all organs 
over time; terminal elimination of PEG was estimated in all tissues in the 
rat and ranged from 14 days (plasma) to 89 days (choroid plexus). This 
indicates that PEG concentrations will not continue to accumulate 
 
 
indefinitely but will reach steady state concentrations in plasma and 
tissues. 
When assessing the clinical relevance of the data from the rat 
distribution study, applying allometric scaling predicts time to reach 
steady-state PEG levels in human tissues to 1–3 years, indicating that 
steady-state PEG concentrations have been reached in all organs in the 
N8-GP clinical development programme. At the cut-off date for this RMPa 
the clinical development programme supports more than 5 years 
exposure of N8-GP.  
Clinical safety data available for other relevant marketed pegylated 
products containing ≥40 kDa PEG have not shown any clinically relevant 
adverse reactions associated with PEG accumulation. 
Currently, there are no known risk factors for accumulation of PEG in the 
brain and in other tissues/organs after long-term treatment with N8-GP.

The risk was based on literature, labelling of others pegylated products 
and post-marketing data for N8-GP. 
No specific risk factors are known for the development of anti-PEG 
antibodies with the use of N8-GP. Moreover, the heterogeneity of the 
cases reported as of the DLP of this report does not allow the MAH to 
specify a particular patient population to be at risk. 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
Routine risk communication: 
The risk of previously treated patients experiencing decreased FVIII 
activity, in the absence of detectable FVIII inhibitors is addressed in

4.   CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
YENTREVE is indicated for women for the treatment of moderate to severe Stress Urinary 
Incontinence (SUI). 
YENTREVE is indicated in adults. 
For further information see section 5.1. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The recommended dose of YENTREVE is 40 mg twice daily without regard to meals. After 2-4 weeks 
of treatment, patients should be re-assessed in order to evaluate the benefit and tolerability of the 
therapy. Some patients may benefit from starting treatment at a dose of 20 mg twice daily for two 
weeks before increasing to the recommended dose of 40 mg twice daily. Dose escalation may 
decrease, though not eliminate, the risk of nausea and dizziness. 
However, limited data are available to support the efficacy of YENTREVE 20 mg twice daily.

The efficacy of YENTREVE has not been evaluated for longer than 3 months in placebo-controlled 
studies. The benefit of treatment should be re-assessed at regular intervals. 
Combining YENTREVE with a pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) programme may be more 
effective than either treatment alone. It is recommended that consideration be given to concomitant 
PFMT. 
Hepatic impairment 
YENTREVE must not be used in women with liver disease resulting in hepatic impairment (see 
sections 4.3 and 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal dysfunction (creatinine 
clearance 30 to 80 ml/min). YENTREVE must not be used in patients with severe renal impairment 
(creatinine clearance <30 ml/min; see section 4.3). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of duloxetine for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence has not been 
studied. No data are available. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
Caution should be exercised when treating the elderly. 
Discontinuation of treatment 
Abrupt discontinuation should be avoided. When stopping treatment with YENTREVE the dose 
should be gradually reduced over a period of at least one to two weeks in order to reduce the risk of 
withdrawal reactions (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in 
the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be 
considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose, but at a more gradual rate. 
Method of administration 
For oral use. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Liver disease resulting in hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). 
YENTREVE  should  not  be  used  in  combination  with  nonselective,  irreversible  monoamine  oxidase 
inhibitors - MAOIs (see section 4.5).  
YENTREVE should not be used in combination with CYP1A2 inhibitors, like fluvoxamine, 
ciprofloxacin or enoxacin since the combination results in elevated plasma concentrations of 
duloxetine (see section 4.5). 
Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min) (see section 4.4). 
The initiation of treatment with YENTREVE is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled 
hypertension that could expose patients to a potential risk of hypertensive crisis (see sections 4.4 and 
4.8).

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Mania and seizures 
YENTREVE should be used with caution in patients with a history of mania or a diagnosis of bipolar 
disorder, and/or seizures. 
Serotonin syndrome 
As with other serotonergic agents, serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, may 
occur with duloxetine treatment, particularly with concomitant use of other serotonergic agents 
(including SSRIs, SNRIs tricyclic antidepressants or triptans), with agents that impair metabolism of 
serotonin such as MAOIs, or with antipsychotics or other dopamine antagonists that may affect the 
serotonergic neurotransmitter systems (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). 
Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, 
coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular 
aberrations (e.g. hyperreflexia, incoordination) and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhoea). 
If concomitant treatment with duloxetine and other serotonergic agents that may affect the 
serotonergic and/or dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems in clinically warranted, careful observation 
of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases. 
St John’s wort 
Adverse reactions may be more common during concomitant use of YENTREVE and herbal 
preparations containing St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum). 
Mydriasis 
Mydriasis has been reported in association with duloxetine, therefore, caution should be used when 
prescribing duloxetine in patients with increased intraocular pressure, or those at risk of acute narrow-
angle glaucoma.  
Blood pressure and heart rate 
Duloxetine has been associated with an increase in blood pressure and clinically significant 
hypertension in some patients. This may be due to the noradrenergic effect of duloxetine. Cases of 
hypertensive crisis have been reported with duloxetine, especially in patients with pre-existing 
hypertension. Therefore, in patients with known hypertension and/or other cardiac disease, blood 
pressure monitoring is recommended, especially during the first month of treatment. Duloxetine 
should be used with caution in patients whose conditions could be compromised by an increased heart 
rate or by an increase in blood pressure. Caution should also be exercised when duloxetine is used 
with medicinal products that may impair its metabolism (see section 4.5). For patients who experience 
a sustained increase in blood pressure while receiving duloxetine either dose reduction or gradual 
discontinuation should be considered (see section 4.8). In patients with uncontrolled hypertension 
duloxetine should not be initiated (see section 4.3). 
Renal impairment 
Increased plasma concentrations of duloxetine occur in patients with severe renal impairment on 
haemodialysis (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min). For patients with severe renal impairment, see 
section 4.3. See section 4.2 for information on patients with mild or moderate renal dysfunction.  
Haemorrhage  
There have been reports of bleeding abnormalities, such as ecchymoses, purpura and gastrointestinal 
haemorrhage with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin/noradrenaline 
reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), including duloxetine. Duloxetine may increase the risk of postpartum 
haemorrhage (see section 4.6). Caution is advised in patients taking anticoagulants and/or medicinal 
products known to affect platelet function (e.g. NSAIDs or acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)), and in patients 
with known bleeding tendencies. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Discontinuation of treatment 
Withdrawal symptoms when treatment is discontinued are common, particularly if discontinuation is 
abrupt (see section 4.8). In a clinical trial, adverse events seen on abrupt treatment discontinuation 
occurred in approximately 44% of patients treated with YENTREVE and 24% of patients taking 
placebo. 
The risk of withdrawal symptoms seen with SSRI’s and SNRI’s may be dependent on several factors 
including the duration and dose of therapy and the rate of dose reduction. The most commonly 
reported reactions are listed in section 4.8. Generally these symptoms are mild to moderate, however, 
in some patients they may be severe in intensity. They usually occur within the first few days of 
discontinuing treatment, but there have been very rare reports of such symptoms in patients who have 
inadvertently missed a dose. Generally these symptoms are self-limiting and usually resolve within 2 
weeks, though in some individuals they may be prolonged (2-3 months or more). It is therefore 
advised that duloxetine should be gradually tapered when discontinuing treatment over a period of no 
less than 2 weeks, according to the patient’s needs (see section 4.2). 
Hyponatraemia 
Hyponatraemia has been reported when administering YENTREVE, including cases with serum 
sodium lower than 110 mmol/l. Hyponatraemia may be due to a syndrome of inappropriate anti-
diuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). The majority of cases of hyponatraemia were reported in the 
elderly, especially when coupled with a recent history of, or condition pre-disposing to, altered fluid 
balance. Caution is required in patients at increased risk for hyponatraemia, such as elderly, cirrhotic, 
or dehydrated patients or patients treated with diuretics.  
Depression, suicidal ideation and behaviour 
Although YENTREVE is not indicated for the treatment of depression, its active ingredient 
(duloxetine) also exists as an antidepressant medicinal product. Depression is associated with an 
increased risk of suicidal thoughts, self harm and suicide (suicide-related events). This risk persists 
until significant remission occurs. As improvement may not occur during the first few weeks or more 
of treatment, patients should be closely monitored until such improvement occurs. It is general clinical 
experience that the risk of suicide may increase in the early stages of recovery. Patients with a history 
of suicide-related events or those exhibiting a significant degree of suicidal thoughts prior to 
commencement of treatment are known to be at a greater risk of suicidal thoughts or suicidal 
behaviour, and should receive careful monitoring during treatment. A meta-analysis of placebo-
controlled clinical trials of antidepressant medicinal products in psychiatric disorders showed an 
increased risk of suicidal behaviour with antidepressants compared to placebo in patients less than 25 
years old. 
Cases of suicidal thoughts and suicidal behaviours have been reported during duloxetine therapy or 
early after treatment discontinuation (see section 4.8). Physicians should encourage patients to report 
any distressing thoughts or feelings or depressive symptoms at any time. If while on YENTREVE 
therapy, the patient develops agitation or depressive symptoms, specialised medical advice should be 
sought, as depression is a serious medical condition. If a decision to initiate antidepressant 
pharmacological therapy is taken, the gradual discontinuation of YENTREVE is recommended (see 
section 4.2). 
Use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age 
YENTREVE should not be used in the treatment of children and adolescents under the age of 18 
years. Suicide-related behaviours (suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts), and hostility 
(predominantly aggression, oppositional behaviour and anger), were more frequently observed in 
clinical trials among children and adolescents treated with antidepressants compared to those treated 
with placebo. If, based on clinical need, a decision to treat is nevertheless taken, the patient should be 
carefully monitored for the appearance of suicidal symptoms.  In addition, long-term safety data in 
children and adolescents concerning growth, maturation and cognitive and behavioural development 
are lacking. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Medicinal products containing duloxetine 
Duloxetine is used under different trademarks in several indications (treatment of diabetic neuropathic 
pain, major depressive disorder, generalised anxiety disorder and stress urinary incontinence). The use 
of more than one of these products concomitantly should be avoided. 
Hepatitis/increased liver enzymes 
Cases of liver injury, including severe elevations of liver enzymes (>10 times upper limit of normal), 
hepatitis and jaundice have been reported with duloxetine (see section 4.8). Most of them occurred 
during the first months of treatment. The pattern of liver damage was predominantly hepatocellular. 
Duloxetine should be used with caution in patients treated with other medicinal products associated 
with hepatic injury. 
Akathisia/psychomotor restlessness 
The use of duloxetine has been associated with the development of akathisia, characterised by a 
subjectively unpleasant or distressing restlessness and need to move often accompanied by an inability 
to sit or stand still. This is most likely to occur within the first few weeks of treatment. In patients who 
develop these symptoms, increasing the dose may be detrimental. 
Sexual dysfunction 
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)/serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) 
may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction (see section 4.8). There have been reports of long-lasting 
sexual dysfunction where the symptoms have continued despite discontinuation of SSRIs/SNRIs. 
Sucrose 
YENTREVE hard gastro-resistant capsules contain sucrose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of 
fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not 
take this medicine. 
Sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): Due to the risk of serotonin syndrome, duloxetine should not 
be used in combination with non-selective irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), or 
within at least 14 days of discontinuing treatment with an MAOI. Based on the half-life of duloxetine, 
at least 5 days should be allowed after stopping YENTREVE before starting an MAOI (see section 
4.3). 
The concomitant use of YENTREVE with selective, reversible MAOIs, like moclobemide, is not 
recommended (see section 4.4). The antibiotic linezolid is a reversible non-selective MAOI and should 
not be given to patients treated with YENTREVE (see section 4.4). 
Inhibitors of CYP1A2: Because CYP1A2 is involved in duloxetine metabolism, concomitant use of 
YENTREVE with potent inhibitors of CYP1A2 is likely to result in higher concentrations of 
duloxetine. Fluvoxamine (100 mg once daily), a potent inhibitor of CYP1A2, decreased the apparent 
plasma clearance of duloxetine by about 77% and increased AUC0-t 6-fold. Therefore YENTREVE 
should not be administered in combination with potent inhibitors of CYP1A2 like fluvoxamine (see 
section 4.3).  
CNS medicinal products: Caution is advised when YENTREVE is taken in combination with other 
centrally acting medicinal products or substances, including alcohol and sedative medicinal products 
(e.g. benzodiazepines, morphinomimetics, antipsychotics, phenobarbital, sedative antihistamines).  
Serotonergic agents: In rare cases, serotonin syndrome has been reported in patients using 
SSRIs/SNRIs concomitantly with serotonergic agents. Caution is advisable if YENTREVE is used 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
concomitantly with serotonergic agents like SSRIs, SNRIs, tricyclic antidepressants like clomipramine 
or amitriptyline, MAOIs like moclobemide or linezolid, St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) or 
triptans, tramadol, pethidine and tryptophan (see section 4.4). 
Effect of duloxetine on other medicinal products 
Medicinal products metabolised by CYP1A2: The pharmacokinetics of theophylline, a CYP1A2 
substrate, were not significantly affected by co-administration with duloxetine (60 mg twice daily).  
Medicinal products metabolised by CYP2D6: Duloxetine is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6. When 
duloxetine was administered at a dose of 60 mg twice daily with a single dose of desipramine, a 
CYP2D6 substrate, the AUC of desipramine increased 3-fold. The co-administration of duloxetine 
(40 mg twice daily) increases steady state AUC of tolterodine (2 mg twice daily) by 71 %, but does 
not affect the pharmacokinetics of its active 5-hydroxyl metabolite and no dosage adjustment is 
recommended. Caution is advised if YENTREVE is co-administered with medicinal products that are 
predominantly metabolised by CYP2D6 (risperidone, tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs] such as 
nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine) particularly if they have a narrow therapeutic index (such 
as flecainide, propafenone and metoprolol). 
Oral contraceptives and other steroidal agents: Results of in vitro studies demonstrate that duloxetine 
does not induce the catalytic activity of CYP3A. Specific in vivo drug interaction studies have not 
been performed.  
Anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents: Caution should be exercised when duloxetine is combined 
with oral anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents due to a potential increased risk of bleeding attributable 
to a pharmacodynamic interaction. Furthermore, increases in INR values have been reported when 
duloxetine was co-administered to patients treated with warfarin. However, concomitant 
administration of duloxetine with warfarin under steady state conditions, in healthy volunteers, as part 
of a clinical pharmacology study, did not result in a clinically significant change in INR from baseline 
or in the pharmacokinetics of R- or S-warfarin. 
Effects of other medicinal products on duloxetine 
Antacids and H2 antagonists: Co-administration of YENTREVE with aluminium- and magnesium-
containing antacids or with famotidine had no significant effect on the rate or extent of duloxetine 
absorption after administration of a 40 mg oral dose. 
Inducers of CYP1A2: Population pharmacokinetic studies analyses have shown that smokers have 
almost 50% lower plasma concentrations of duloxetine compared with non-smokers. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Fertility 
In animal studies, duloxetine had no effect on male fertility, and effects in females were only evident 
at doses that caused maternal toxicity. 
Pregnancy  
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity at systemic exposure levels (AUC) of duloxetine 
lower than the maximum clinical exposure (see section 5.3). 
Two large observational studies do not suggest an overall increased risk of major congenital 
malformation (one from the US including 2,500 exposed to duloxetine during the first trimester and 
one from the EU including 1,500 exposed to duloxetine during the first trimester). The analysis on 
specific malformations such as cardiac malformations shows inconclusive results. 
In the EU study, maternal exposure to duloxetine during late pregnancy (at any time from 20 weeks 
gestational age to delivery) was associated with an increased risk for preterm birth (less than 2-fold, 
corresponding to approximately 6 additional premature births per 100 women treated with duloxetine 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
late in pregnancy). The majority occurred between 35 and 36 weeks of gestation. This association was 
not seen in the US study. 
The US observational data have provided evidence of an increased risk (less than 2-fold) of 
postpartum haemorrhage following duloxetine exposure within the month prior to birth. 
Epidemiological data have suggested that the use of SSRIs in pregnancy, particularly in late 
pregnancy, may increase the risk of persistent pulmonary hypertension in the newborn (PPHN). 
Although no studies have investigated the association of PPHN to SNRI treatment, this potential risk 
cannot be ruled out with duloxetine taking into account the related mechanism of action (inhibition of 
the re-uptake of serotonin).  
As with other serotonergic medicinal products, discontinuation symptoms may occur in the neonate 
after maternal duloxetine use near term. Discontinuation symptoms seen with duloxetine may include 
hypotonia, tremor, jitteriness, feeding difficulty, respiratory distress and seizures. The majority of 
cases have occurred either at birth or within a few days of birth. 
YENTREVE should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the 
foetus. Women should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant, or intend to 
become pregnant, during therapy.  
Breast feeding 
Duloxetine is very weakly excreted into human milk based on a study of 6 lactating patients, who did 
not breast feed their children. The estimated daily infant dose on a mg/kg basis is approximately 
0.14% of the maternal dose (see section 5.2). As the safety of duloxetine in infants is not known, the 
use of YENTREVE while breast-feeding is not recommended. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. YENTREVE 
may be associated with sedation and dizziness. Patients should be instructed that if they experience 
sedation or dizziness they should avoid potentially hazardous tasks such as driving or operating 
machinery. 
4.8  Undesirable effects  
a. Summary of the safety profile 
The most commonly reported adverse events in patients treated with YENTREVE in clinical trials in 
SUI and other lower urinary tract disorders were nausea, dry mouth fatigue and constipation. The data 
analysis of four 12-week, placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients with SUI, including 958 
duloxetine-treated and 955 placebo-treated patients, showed that the onset of the reported adverse 
events typically occurred in the first week of therapy. However, the majority of the most frequent 
adverse events were mild to moderate and resolved within 30 days of occurrence (e.g. nausea). 
b. Tabulated summary of adverse reactions 
Table 1 gives the adverse reactions observed from spontaneous reporting and in placebo-controlled 
clinical trials.

c. Description of selected adverse reactions 
Discontinuation of duloxetine (particularly when abrupt) commonly leads to withdrawal symptoms. 
Dizziness, sensory disturbances (including paraesthesia or electric shock-like sensations, particularly 
in the head), sleep disturbances (including insomnia and intense dreams), fatigue, somnolence, 
agitation or anxiety, nausea and/or vomiting, tremor, headache, myalgia, irritability, diarrhoea, 
hyperhydrosis and vertigo are the most commonly reported reactions. 
Generally, for SSRIs and SNRIs, these events are mild to moderate and self-limiting, however, in 
some patients they may be severe and/or prolonged. It is therefore advised that when duloxetine 
treatment is no longer required, gradual discontinuation by dose tapering should be carried out (see 
sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
The heart rate-corrected QT interval in duloxetine-treated patients did not differ from that seen in 
placebo-treated patients. No clinically significant differences were observed for QT, PR, QRS, or 
QTcB measurements between duloxetine-treated and placebo-treated patients. 
In the 12 week acute phase of three clinical trials of duloxetine in patients with diabetic neuropathic 
pain, small but statistically significant increases in fasting blood glucose were observed in duloxetine-
treated patients. HbA1c was stable in both duloxetine-treated and placebo-treated patients. In the 
extension phase of these studies, which lasted up to 52 weeks, there was an increase in HbA1c in both 
the duloxetine and routine care groups, but the mean increase was 0.3% greater in the duloxetine-
treated group. There was also a small increase in fasting blood glucose and in total cholesterol in 
duloxetine-treated patients while those laboratory tests showed a slight decrease in the routine care 
group.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Cases of overdoses, alone or in combination with other medicinal products, with duloxetine doses of 
5400 mg were reported. Some fatalities have occurred, primarily with mixed overdoses, but also with 
duloxetine alone at a dose of approximately 1000 mg. Signs and symptoms of overdose (duloxetine 
alone or in combination with other medicinal products) included somnolence, coma, serotonin 
syndrome, seizures, vomiting and tachycardia.   
No specific antidote is known for duloxetine but if serotonin syndrome ensues, specific treatment 
(such as with cyproheptadine and/or temperature control) may be considered. A free airway should be 
established. Monitoring of cardiac and vital signs is recommended, along with appropriate 
symptomatic and supportive measures. Gastric lavage may be indicated if performed soon after 
ingestion or in symptomatic patients. Activated charcoal may be useful in limiting absorption. 
Duloxetine has a large volume of distribution and forced diuresis, haemoperfusion, and exchange 
perfusion are unlikely to be beneficial.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other antidepressants. ATC code: N06AX21. 
Mechanism of action 
Duloxetine is a combined serotonin (5-HT) and noradrenaline (NA) reuptake inhibitor. It weakly 
inhibits dopamine reuptake with no significant affinity for histaminergic, dopaminergic, cholinergic 
and adrenergic receptors.  
Pharmacodynamic effects 
In animal studies, increased levels of 5-HT and NE in the sacral spinal cord, lead to increased urethral 
tone via enhanced pudendal nerve stimulation to the urethral striated sphincter muscle only during the 
storage phase of the micturition cycle. A similar mechanism in women is believed to result in stronger 
urethral closure during urine storage with physical stress that could explain the efficacy of duloxetine 
in the treatment of women with SUI.  
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy of duloxetine 40 mg given twice daily in the treatment of SUI was established in four 
double-blind, placebo-controlled studies that randomised 1913 women (22 to 83 years) with SUI; of 
these, 958 patients were randomised to duloxetine and 955 to placebo. The primary efficacy measures 
were Incontinence Episode Frequency (IEF) from diaries and an incontinence specific quality of life 
questionnaire score (I-QOL). 
Incontinence Episode Frequency: In all four studies the duloxetine-treated group had a 50% or greater 
median decrease in IEF compared with 33% in the placebo-treated group. Differences were observed 
at each visit after 4 weeks (duloxetine 54% and placebo 22%), 8 weeks (52% and 29%), and 12 weeks 
(52% and 33%) of medication.  
In an additional study limited to patients with severe SUI, all responses with duloxetine were achieved 
within 2 weeks.  
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The efficacy of YENTREVE has not been evaluated for longer than 3 months in placebo-controlled 
studies. The clinical benefit of YENTREVE compared with placebo has not been demonstrated in 
women with mild SUI, defined in randomised trials as those with IEF < 14 per week. In these women, 
YENTREVE may provide no benefit beyond that afforded by more conservative behavioural 
interventions. 
Quality of Life: Incontinence Quality of Life (I-QOL) questionnaire scores were significantly 
improved in the duloxetine-treated patient group compared with the placebo-treated group (9.2 versus 
5.9 score improvement, p<0.001). Using a global improvement scale (PGI), significantly more women 
using duloxetine considered their symptoms of stress incontinence to be improved with treatment 
compared with women using placebo (64.6% versus 50.1%, p<0.001). 
YENTREVE and Prior Continence Surgery: There are limited data that suggest that the benefits of 
YENTREVE are not diminished in women with stress urinary incontinence who have previously 
undergone continence surgery. 
YENTREVE and Pelvic Floor Muscle Training (PFMT): During a 12-week blinded, randomised, 
controlled study, YENTREVE demonstrated greater reductions in IEF compared with either placebo 
treatment or with PFMT alone. Combined therapy (duloxetine + PFMT) showed greater improvement 
in both pad use and condition-specific quality of life measures than YENTREVE alone or PFMT 
alone. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Yentreve in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of stress urinary incontinence. See 
section 4.2 for information on paediatric use. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Duloxetine is administered as a single enantiomer. Duloxetine is extensively metabolised by oxidative 
enzymes (CYP1A2 and the polymorphic CYP2D6), followed by conjugation. The pharmacokinetics of 
duloxetine demonstrate large intersubject variability (generally 50-60%), partly due to gender, age, 
smoking status and CYP2D6 metaboliser status.  
Absorption: Duloxetine is well absorbed after oral administration with a Cmax occurring 6 hours post 
dose. The absolute oral bioavailability of duloxetine ranged from 32% to 80% (mean of 50%). Food 
delays the time to reach the peak concentration from 6 to 10 hours and it marginally decreases the 
extent of absorption (approximately 11 %). These changes do not have any clinical significance.  
Distribution: Duloxetine is approximately 96% bound to human plasma proteins. Duloxetine binds to 
both albumin and alpha-l acid glycoprotein. Protein binding is not affected by renal or hepatic 
impairment. 
Biotransformation: Duloxetine is extensively metabolised and the metabolites are excreted principally 
in urine. Both cytochromes P450-2D6 and 1A2 catalyse the formation of the two major metabolites 
glucuronide conjugate of 4-hydroxy duloxetine and sulfate conjugate of 5-hydroxy 6-methoxy 
duloxetine. Based upon in vitro studies, the circulating metabolites of duloxetine are considered 
pharmacologically inactive. The pharmacokinetics of duloxetine in patients who are poor metabolisers 
with respect to CYP2D6 has not been specifically investigated. Limited data suggest that the plasma 
levels of duloxetine are higher in these patients. 
Elimination: The elimination half-life of duloxetine ranges from 8 to 17 hours (mean of 12 hours). 
After an intravenous dose the plasma clearance of duloxetine ranges from 22 l/hr to 46 l/hr (mean of 
36 l/hr). After an oral dose the apparent plasma clearance of duloxetine ranges from 33 to 261 l/hr 
(mean 101 l/hr). 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Special populations 
Gender: Pharmacokinetic differences have been identified between males and females (apparent 
plasma clearance is approximately 50% lower in females). Based upon the overlap in the range of 
clearance, gender-based pharmacokinetic differences do not justify the recommendation for using a 
lower dose for female patients.  
Age: Pharmacokinetic differences have been identified between younger and elderly females (≥65 years) 
(AUC increases by about 25% and half-life is about 25% longer in the elderly), although the magnitude 
of  these  changes  is  not  sufficient  to  justify  adjustments  to  the  dose.  As  a  general  recommendation, 
caution should be exercised when treating the elderly (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Renal impairment: End stage renal disease (ESRD) patients receiving dialysis had 2-fold higher 
duloxetine Cmax and AUC values compared with healthy subjects. Pharmacokinetic data on duloxetine 
is limited in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. 
Hepatic impairment: Moderate liver disease (Child Pugh Class B) affected the pharmacokinetics of 
duloxetine. Compared with healthy subjects, the apparent plasma clearance of duloxetine was 79% 
lower, the apparent terminal half-life was 2.3 times longer, and the AUC was 3.7 times higher in 
patients with moderate liver disease. The pharmacokinetics of duloxetine and its metabolites have not 
been studied in patients with mild or severe hepatic insufficiency. 
Breast-feeding mothers: The disposition of duloxetine was studied in 6 lactating women who were at 
least 12-weeks postpartum. Duloxetine is detected in breast milk, and steady-state concentrations in 
breast milk are about one-fourth those in plasma. The amount of duloxetine in breast milk is 
approximately 7 µg/day while on 40 mg twice daily dosing. Lactation did not influence duloxetine 
pharmacokinetics.  
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Duloxetine was not genotoxic in a standard battery of tests and was not carcinogenic in rats.  
Multinucleated cells were seen in the liver in the absence of other histopathological changes in the rat 
carcinogenicity study. The underlying mechanism and the clinical relevance are unknown.  Female 
mice receiving duloxetine for 2 years had an increased incidence of hepatocellular adenomas and 
carcinomas at the high dose only (144 mg/kg/day), but these were considered to be secondary to 
hepatic microsomal enzyme induction. The relevance of this mouse data to humans is unknown. 
Female rats receiving duloxetine before and during mating and early pregnancy had a decrease in 
maternal food consumption and body weight, oestrous cycle disruption, decreased live birth indices 
and progeny survival, and progeny growth retardation at systemic exposure levels estimated to be at 
the most at maximum clinical exposure (AUC). In an embryotoxicity study in the rabbit, a higher 
incidence of cardiovascular and skeletal malformations was observed at systemic exposure levels 
below the maximum clinical exposure (AUC). No malformations were observed in another study 
testing a higher dose of a different salt of duloxetine. In pre/postnatal toxicity study in the rat, 
duloxetine induced adverse behavioural effects in the offspring at systemic exposure levels below 
maximum clinical exposure (AUC).  
Studies in juvenile rats reveal transient effects on neurobehaviour, as well as significantly decreased 
body weight and food consumption; hepatic enzyme induction; and hepatocellular vacuolation at 45 
mg/kg/day. The general toxicity profile of duloxetine in juvenile rats was similar to that in adult rats. 
The no-adverse effect level was determined to be 20 mg/kg/day.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What YENTREVE is and what it is used for 
YENTREVE contains the active substance duloxetine. YENTREVE increases the levels of serotonin 
and noradrenaline in the nervous system. 
YENTREVE is a medicine to be taken by mouth to treat Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI) in women. 
Stress urinary incontinence is a medical condition in which patients have accidental loss or leakage of 
urine during physical exertion or activities such as laughing, coughing, sneezing, lifting, or exercise. 
YENTREVE is believed to work by increasing the strength of the muscle that holds back urine when 
you laugh, sneeze, or perform physical activities. 
The efficacy of YENTREVE is reinforced when combined with a training program called Pelvic Floor 
Muscle Training (PFMT). 
2.   What you need to know before you take YENTREVE 
DO NOT take YENTREVE if you: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
are allergic to duloxetine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) 
have liver disease 
have severe kidney disease 
are taking or have taken within the last 14 days, another medicine known as a monoamine oxidase 
inhibitor (MAOI) (see ‘Other medicines and YENTREVE’) 
are taking fluvoxamine which is usually used to treat depression, ciprofloxacin or enoxacin which 
are used to treat some infections

Talk to your doctor if you have high blood pressure or heart disease. Your doctor will tell you if you 
should be taking YENTREVE.

Warnings and Precautions 
The following are reasons why YENTREVE may not be suitable for you. Talk to your doctor before 
you take Yentreve if you: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
are taking medicines to treat depression (see ‘Other medicines and YENTREVE’) 
are taking St. John’s Wort, a herbal treatment (Hypericum perforatum) 
have kidney disease 
have had seizures (fits) 
have had mania 
suffer from bipolar disorder 
have eye problems, such as certain kinds of glaucoma (increased pressure in the eye) 
have a history of bleeding disorders (tendency to develop bruises), especially if you are 
pregnant (see ‘Pregnancy and breast-feeding‘) 
are at risk of low sodium levels (for example if you are taking diuretics, especially if you are 
elderly) 
are currently being treated with another medicine which may cause liver damage. 
are taking other medicines containing duloxetine (see ‘Other medicines and YENTREVE’) 
- 
- 
- 
YENTREVE may cause a sensation of restlessness or an inability to sit or stand still. You should tell 
your doctor if this happens to you. 
Medicines like Yentreve (so called SSRIs/SNRIs) may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction (see 
section 4). In some cases, these symptoms have continued after stopping treatment. 
Thoughts of suicide and worsening of depression or anxiety disorder  
Although YENTREVE is not indicated for the treatment of depression, its active ingredient 
(duloxetine) is used as an antidepressant medicine. If you are depressed and/or have anxiety disorders 
you can sometimes have thoughts of harming or killing yourself. These may be increased when first 
starting antidepressants, since these medicines all take time to work, usually about two weeks but 
sometimes longer. 
You may be more likely to think like this if you:  
- 
- 
have previously had thoughts about killing or harming yourself 
are a young adult. Information from clinical trials has shown an increased risk of suicidal 
behaviour in adults aged less than 25 years with psychiatric conditions who were treated with an 
antidepressant 
If you have thoughts of harming or killing yourself at any time, contact your doctor or go to a 
hospital straight away. 
You may find it helpful to tell a relative or close friend that you are depressed or have an anxiety 
disorder, and ask them to read this leaflet. You might ask them to tell you if they think your depression 
or anxiety is getting worse, or if they are worried about changes in your behaviour. 
Children and adolescents under 18 years of age 
YENTREVE should not be used for children and adolescents under 18 years. Also, you should know 
that patients under 18 have an increased risk of side-effects such as suicide attempt, suicidal thoughts 
and hostility (predominantly aggression, oppositional behaviour and anger) when they take this class 
of medicines. Also, the long-term safety effects concerning growth, maturation, and cognitive and 
behavioural development of YENTREVE in this age group have not yet been demonstrated. 
Other medicines and YENTREVE 
Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.  
diabetic neuropathic pain, depression, anxiety and urinary incontinence 
The main ingredient of YENTREVE, duloxetine, is used in other medicines for other conditions: 
• 
Using more than one of these medicines at the same time should be avoided. Check with your doctor if 
you are already taking other medicines containing duloxetine. 
33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Your doctor should decide whether you can take YENTREVE with other medicines. Do not start or 
stop taking any medicines, including those bought without a prescription and herbal remedies, 
before checking with your doctor.  
You should also tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following: 
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): You should not take YENTREVE if you are taking or have 
recently taken (within the last 14 days) an antidepressant medicine called a monoamine oxidase 
inhibitor (MAOI). Examples of MAOIs include moclobemide (an antidepressant) and linezolid (an 
antibiotic).  Taking a MAOI together with many prescription medicines, including YENTREVE, can 
cause serious or even life-threatening side effects. You must wait at least 14 days after you have 
stopped taking an MAOI before you can take YENTREVE. Also, you need to wait at least 5 days after 
you stop taking YENTREVE before you take a MAOI. 
Medicines that cause sleepiness: These include medicines prescribed by your doctor including 
benzodiazepines, strong painkillers, antipsychotics, phenobarbital and sedative antihistamines. 
Medicines that increase the level of serotonin: Triptans, tramadol, tryptophan, SSRIs (such as 
paroxetine and fluoxetine), SNRIs (such as venlafaxine), tricyclic antidepressants (such as 
clomipramine, amitriptyline), pethidine, St John’s Wort and MAOIs (such as moclobemide and 
linezolid). These medicines increase the risk of side effects; if you get any unusual symptom taking 
any of these medicines together with YENTREVE, you should see your doctor.  
Oral anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents: Medicines which thin the blood or prevent the blood from 
clotting. These medicines might increase the risk of bleeding. 
YENTREVE with food, drink and alcohol 
YENTREVE may be taken with or without food. You should take extra care if you drink alcohol while 
taking YENTREVE.  
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
• 
Tell your doctor if you become pregnant, or you are trying to become pregnant, while you are 
taking YENTREVE. You should use YENTREVE only after discussing the potential benefits 
and any potential risks to your unborn child with your doctor. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Make sure your midwife and/or doctor knows you are on YENTREVE. When taken during 
pregnancy, similar drugs (SSRIs) may increase the risk of a serious condition in babies, called 
persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN), making the baby breathe faster and 
appear bluish. These symptoms usually begin during the first 24 hours after the baby is born. If 
this happens to your baby you should contact your midwife and/or doctor immediately. 
If you take YENTREVE near the end of your pregnancy, your baby might have some symptoms 
when it is born. These usually begin at birth or within a few days of your baby being born. 
These symptoms may include floppy muscles, trembling, jitteriness, not feeding properly, 
trouble with breathing and fits. If your baby has any of these symptoms when it is born, or you 
are concerned about your baby’s health, contact your doctor or midwife who will be able to 
advise you. 
If you take YENTREVE near the end of your pregnancy there is an increased risk of excessive 
vaginal bleeding shortly after birth, especially if you have a history of bleeding disorders. Your 
doctor or midwife should be aware that you are taking duloxetine so they can advise you. 
Available data from the use of YENTREVE during the first three months of pregnancy do not 
show an increased risk of overall birth defects in general in the child. If YENTREVE is taken 
during the second half of pregnancy, there may be an increased risk that the infant will be born 
34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
early (6 additional premature infants for every 100 women who take YENTREVE in the second 
half of pregnancy), mostly between weeks 35 and 36 of pregnancy. 
• 
Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding. The use of YENTREVE while breastfeeding is not 
recommended. You should ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice. 
Driving and using machines 
YENTREVE may make you feel sleepy or dizzy. Do not drive or use any tools or machines until you 
know how YENTREVE affects you. 
YENTREVE contains sucrose 
YENTREVE contains sucrose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to 
some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product.  
YENTREVE contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
3.   How to take YENTREVE 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure.  
YENTREVE is for oral use. You should swallow your capsule whole with a drink of water. 
The recommended dose of YENTREVE is 40 mg twice a day (in the morning and late 
afternoon/evening). Your doctor may decide to start your treatment with 20 mg twice a day for two 
weeks before increasing the dose to 40 mg twice a day.  
To help you remember to take YENTREVE, you may find it easier to take it at the same times every 
day.  
Do not stop taking YENTREVE, or change your dose, without talking to your doctor. Treating your 
disorder properly is important to help you get better.  If it is not treated, your condition may not go 
away and may become more serious and difficult to treat. 
If you take more YENTREVE than you should 
Call your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you take more than the amount of YENTREVE 
prescribed by your doctor. Symptoms of overdose include sleepiness, coma, serotonin syndrome (a 
rare reaction which may cause feelings of great happiness, drowsiness, clumsiness, restlessness, 
feeling of being drunk, fever, sweating or rigid muscles), fits, vomiting and fast heart rate. 
If you forget to take YENTREVE 
If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember. However, if it is time for your next dose, skip the 
missed dose and take only a single dose as usual. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten 
dose. Do not take more than the daily amount of YENTREVE that has been prescribed for you in one 
day. 
If you stop taking YENTREVE 
DO NOT stop taking your capsules without the advice of your doctor even if you feel better. If your 
doctor thinks that you no longer need YENTREVE he or she will ask you to reduce your dose over 2 
weeks.  
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Some patients, who suddenly stop taking YENTREVE after more than 1 week of therapy, have had 
symptoms such as:  
• 
dizziness, tingling feelings like pins and needles or electric shock-like feelings (particularly in 
the head), sleep disturbances (vivid dreams, nightmares, inability to sleep), fatigue, sleepiness, 
feeling restless or agitated, feeling anxious, feeling sick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting), 
shaking (tremor), headaches, muscle pain, feeling irritable, diarrhoea, excessive sweating or 
vertigo.  
These symptoms are usually not serious and disappear within a few days, but if you have symptoms 
that are troublesome you should ask your doctor for advice. 
If you have further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

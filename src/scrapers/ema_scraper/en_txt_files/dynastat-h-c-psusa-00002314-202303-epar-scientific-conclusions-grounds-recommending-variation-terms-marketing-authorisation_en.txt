Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for parecoxib, the scientific 
conclusions of PRAC are as follows:  
In view of available data on the use of parecoxib during pregnancy, and the previous PRAC advice about 
use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) during pregnancy, the PRAC concluded that the 
product information of Dynastat should be amended accordingly. 
Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and 
grounds for recommendation. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for parecoxib the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing parecoxib is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

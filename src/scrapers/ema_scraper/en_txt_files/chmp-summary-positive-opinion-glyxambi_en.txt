Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Glyxambi 
empagliflozin / linagliptin 
On 15 September 2016, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Glyxambi, 
intended for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The applicant for this medicinal product is Boehringer 
Ingelheim International GmbH. 
Glyxambi is a fixed-dose combination of empagliflozin and linagliptin, two oral blood glucose lowering 
medicines (ATC code: A10BD19). It will be available as film-coated tablets (containing either 10 mg 
empagliflozin and 5 mg linagliptin, or 25 mg empagliflozin and 5 mg linagliptin). Empagliflozin is a 
competitive, reversible, selective and orally active inhibitor of the human sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 
(SGLT2) which reduces renal glucose re-absorption leading to urinary glucose excretion. Linagliptin is a 
dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitor. DPP-4 inhibition reduces the cleavage and inactivation of the 
incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), leading to an increase in incretin levels, which in turn 
stimulates glucose-dependent insulin secretion and inhibits the release of glucagon. 
The benefit with Glyxambi is its ability to lower blood glucose. The most common side effect was urinary 
tract infection (7.5% with Glyxambi 10 mg/5 mg and 8.5% with Glyxambi 25 mg/5 mg). The most serious 
adverse reactions were ketoacidosis (<0.1%), pancreatitis (0.2%), hypersensitivity (0.6%), and 
hypoglycaemia (2.4%). 
The full indication is:  
“Glyxambi, fixed dose combination of empagliflozin and linagliptin, is indicated in adults aged 18 years and 
older with type 2 diabetes mellitus:  
• 
to improve glycaemic control when metformin and/or sulphonylurea (SU) and one of the 
monocomponents of Glyxambi do not provide adequate glycaemic control 
•  when already being treated with the free combination of empagliflozin and linagliptin”

1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Requested type II variation 
Pursuant to Article 16 of  Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Glaxo  Group Ltd submitted to the 
European Medicines Agency on 31 July 2014 an application for a variation. 
The following changes were proposed:

Phase  I  Study  of  Pazopanib  as  a  Single  Agent  for  Children  with  Relapsed  or  Refractory  Solid  Tumours, 
including central nervous system (CNS) tumours. 
1.2.  Rationale for the proposed change 
This Type II variation supports the amendment of the SmPC, Section 4.2, Paediatric population, to delete the 
sentence “No data are available”. 
Results from study ADVL0815/PZP114411, a Phase I Study of Pazopanib as a Single Agent for Children with 
Relapsed or Refractory Solid Tumours, including central nervous system (CNS) tumours, are available and 
the statement of “no data are available” is no longer appropriate. The available paediatric data regarding 
safety  and  tolerability  of  pazopanib  are limited  and  therefore  the  conclusion “that  safety  and  efficacy of 
pazopanib in children aged 2 to 18 years have not been established” remains unchanged.  
2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
The  MAH  for  Votrient  (pazopanib)  has  submitted  a  variation  in  order  to  amend  the  SmPC,  Section  4.2, 
Paediatric population, to delete the sentence “No data are available”. 
With the variation results from study ADVL0815/PZP114411, a Phase I Study of Pazopanib as a Single Agent 
for Children with Relapsed or Refractory Solid Tumours, including central nervous system (CNS) tumours, 
has  been  included.  The  primary  purpose  of  the  phase  I  study  ADVL0815  was  to  identify  the  maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) of pazopanib for administration to children, adolescents and young adults. The primary 
objectives were to evaluate toxicity and begin the process of characterising pazopanib PK parameters in a 
paediatric  population.    Evaluation  of  clinical  activity  was  a  secondary  objective.  A  total  of  53  paediatric 
subjects with a variety of relapsed/refractory solid tumours were evaluated and reported.  
The  data  showed  that  plasma  pazopanib  concentrations  associated  with  clinical  and  biologic  effects 
consistent with VEGFR inhibition (20 µg/mL) were achieved at all dose levels after oral administration of 
tablets/suspension.  
Some clinical activity of pazopanib was observed in a heavily pretreated paediatric population.  
Clinical activity included 2 subjects with partial responses in refractory desmoplastic small round cell tumour 
and hepatoblastoma. Stable disease were seen in 12 subjects (23%) in a variety of tumour types (malignant 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/704739/2014 
Page 4/17 
 
  
  
 
melanoma (n=2), synovial sarcoma (n=2), alveolar soft part sarcoma, malignant glioma, osteosarcoma,  
desmoplastic  small  round  cell  tumour,  alveolar  rhabdomyosarcoma  (n=2),  alveolar  soft  part  sarcoma, 
gastrointestinal stromal sarcoma.  
Serious adverse events were reported for 25 (47%) subjects.  The most common SAEs were anaemia (4 
[8%] subjects), increased lipase (4 [8%] subjects), abdominal pain, dyspnoea and hypothyroidism (each in 
3 [6%] subjects). No other SAEs were reported for greater than 2 subjects. Decreases in left ventricular 
ejection fraction were reported for 9 (17%) subjects, 3/17 at the MTD for tablets and none at the MTD for the 
suspension.  All (3) fatal SAEs had the primary cause of death related to their disease.  The types of AEs 
observed was consistent with those seen in the adult population treated with pazopanib.    
Overall conclusion 
It can be agreed that based on the data from this small paediatric study no firm conclusion can be drawn 
about activity nor safety  in particular tumour types and consequently efficacy of pazopanib in children aged 
2 to 18 years of age based on the data from this study has not yet been established. The overall efficacy and 
safety  profile  of  pazopanib  in  the  approved  indications  (renal  cell  carcinoma  and  soft  tissue  sarcoma) 
remains unchanged.   
With the provided data the statement currently included in the SmPC section 4.2; “no data are available” is 
no longer appropriate. It is also endorsed that even though some information is now available the overall 
paediatric data regarding safety and tolerability of pazopanib are still limited and therefore the conclusion 
“that safety and efficacy of pazopanib in children aged 2 to 18 years have not been established” should 
remain unchanged. 
It  has  been  considered  whether  it  could  be  of  value  to  evaluate  the  data  by  comparing  the  PK 
data/parameters  in  adults  with  those  in  children  of  the  various  age  categories  (2-6,  6-12,  12-18  years 
and >18 years) taking into account possible differences in formulation and absolute doses and provide some 
level of paediatric PK data in section 5.2 of the SmPC. This has been addressed by the MAH. As Votrient 
(pazopanib)  is  not  approved  for  the  use  in  the  paediatric  population,  and  the  numbers  on  which  any 
pharmacokinetic information may be based on and subsequently addressed in section 4.2 is very limited it 
is considered fully acceptable that nothing further may be included in section 5.2 in the SmPC.

4.  Scientific discussion 
4.1.  Introduction 
Votrient (Pazopanib), a multi-target receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor 
receptors (VEGFR) -1, -2 and -3, platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR) –α and -β, and stem cell 
factor receptor (c-kit), is approved in the EU for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma 
(RCC) and also for the treatment of patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma who have received prior 
chemotherapy.   
At  the  time  of  the  type  II  variation  to  include  advanced  soft  tissue  sarcoma  as  a  therapeutic  indication 
(EMEA/H/C/001141/II/007), the MAH agreed to add text regarding the paediatric population to Section 4.2 
of the SmPC.  The currently approved text is as follows:  
Paediatric population 
Pazopanib should not be used in children younger than 2 years of age because of safety concerns on organ 
growth and maturation (see Section 4.4 and 5.3). 
The safety and efficacy of pazopanib in children aged 2 to 18 years of age have not yet been established (see 
Section 5.1).  No data are available. 
With this type II variation the MAH asks for an amendment of the SmPC, Section 4.2, Paediatric population, 
in order to delete the sentence “No data are available.”   
The proposed change is below (proposed deleted text is struck through): 
Paediatric population 
Pazopanib should not be used in children younger than 2 years of age because of safety concerns on organ 
growth and maturation (see Section 4.4 and 5.3). 
The safety and efficacy of pazopanib in children aged 2 to 18 years of age have not yet been established (see 
Section 5.1). No data are available. 
The MAH has submitted the results from a Phase I paediatric study and consequently the statement of “no 
data are available” is no longer appropriate. However, the available paediatric data regarding safety and 
tolerability of pazopanib are limited and therefore the conclusion “that safety and efficacy of pazopanib in 
children aged 2 to 18 years have not been established” remains unchanged.  
The data submitted with this application relates to the use of pazopanib in the paediatric population from a 
study in children with relapsed or refractory solid tumours. The study; ADVL0815 (PZP114411), a Phase I 
Study  of  Pazopanib  as  a  Single  Agent  for  Children  with  Relapsed or  Refractory  Solid  Tumours,  including 
central nervous system (CNS) tumours, was conducted by the Children’s Oncology Group and the National 
Cancer Institute (NCI), US.

Study ADVL0815 (PZP114411) 
Study Design 
Study ADVL0815 was a phase I trial design where pazopanib, as a single agent, was administered orally on 
a once daily basis.   The primary purpose of ADVL0815 was to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) 
of pazopanib for administration to children, adolescents and young adults  with refractory solid tumours, 
including central nervous system tumours.  Other primary objectives were to evaluate toxicity and obtain 
initial pazopanib pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters in a paediatric patient population.   Evaluation of clinical 
activity was a secondary objective. 
This study was a three-part study: 
• 
Part 1 (Phase I Dose Escalation): The starting dose of pazopanib was 275 mg/m2.  Pazopanib dosing 
was  escalated  in  subsequent  cohorts  in  increments  of  approximately  30%.    There  was  no 
intrapatient dose escalation.  Blood samples were obtained for PK analysis and correlative biology 
studies  including  VEGF  haplotype,  plasma  levels  of  VEGF,  P1GF,  soluble  VEGFR1,  and  soluble 
VEGFR2 and measurement of circulating endothelial cells and peripheral blood monocytes.  Changes 
in tumour vascular permeability in response to pazopanib were also explored using dynamic contrast 
enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). 
• 
• 
Part  2a  (Suspension  Formulation  Component):  The  starting  dose  was  50%  of  the  MTD  as 
determined in Part 1.  Once the MTD or highest dose level was reached, the cohort was expanded in 
order  to  obtain  additional  safety  information  and  PK  data  for  the  suspension  formulation.    PK 
evaluation was required in all subjects who participated in this component of the study.   
Part 2b (Expanded Imaging Cohort): At the MTD or recommended Phase II dose, a cohort of up to 
10 subjects with recurrent or refractory (revised to relapsed or refractory in Protocol Amendment 
1A) soft tissue sarcoma (revised to soft tissue sarcoma, desmoplastic small round cell tumour or 
extra-osseous Ewing sarcoma in Protocol Amendment 2) and a measurable (at least 2 cm) lesion in 
the head, neck, extremity or fixed within the abdomen or pelvis (revised to thorax, abdomen or 
pelvis in Protocol Amendment 2) such that it is not sensitive to motion artefact were recruited to 
further  explore  changes  in  tumour  vascular  permeability  using  DCE-MRI.    Imaging  studies  and 
limited PK sampling was required in all subjects who participated in this component of the study.  
The primary objectives of this study were: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/704739/2014 
Page 7/17 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
• 
To estimate the MTD and/or recommended Phase II dose of oral pazopanib administered on a once 
daily schedule to children with refractory solid tumours. 
• 
• 
To define and describe the toxicities of oral pazopanib administered as either a tablet or suspension. 
To characterise the PK of oral pazopanib in children with refractory solid tumours. 
The secondary objectives of this study were: 
• 
To preliminarily define the anti-tumour activity of oral pazopanib within the confines of a Phase I 
study. 
• 
To assess the biological activity of oral pazopanib including changes in peripheral blood monocyte 
counts, CECs, and plasma angiogenic factors. 
• 
To explore changes in tumour vascular permeability following initiation of pazopanib therapy and to 
correlate these changes with clinical outcome, as applicable. Specifically, to evaluate changes in (DCE-MRI) 
scans obtained within 15 ± 2 days after initiation of pazopanib therapy as compared to baseline within a soft 
tissue sarcoma cohort. 
• 
To  preliminarily  assess  vascular  endothelial  growth 
factor  (VEGF)  haplotype/phenotype 
relationships in a paediatric cancer patient population. 
• 
To explore pazopanib concentration effect relationships with biomarkers and with clinical outcomes, 
including hypertension. 
Enrollment 
Subjects were to be enrolled on the study once all eligibility requirements for the study were met.  Subjects 
who gave informed consent, or whose parents or guardian gave informed consent if the subject was a child, 
in order to undergo screening for eligibility were not considered enrolled and were not to be enrolled until the 
screening was completed and they were determined to meet all eligibility criteria.  Subjects were not to 
receive any protocol therapy prior to enrolment.  Complete inclusion/exclusion criteria can be found in the 
clinical pharmacology study report. 
Treatment 
In all parts of the study, treatment cycles were defined as 28 days in duration.  Subjects were to receive up 
to  a  total of  24  cycles of  therapy  with  pazopanib  in  the  absence  of  progressive  disease  or  unacceptable 
toxicity.  A maximum of 55 subjects were anticipated (increased from 46 subjects in Protocol Amendment 
3). 
Part 1: Phase I Dose Escalation 
Subjects with recurrent or refractory (revised to relapsed or refractory in Protocol Amendment 1A) solid or 
CNS tumours were enrolled.  Two to six evaluable subjects were entered at each dose level for determination 
of MTD.  A minimum of 9 and a maximum of 24 evaluable subjects were expected to be enrolled in Part 1 of 
the study.  In Protocol Amendment 3, this was increased to a maximum of 27 subjects. 
Part 2a: Suspension Formulation Component 
Once the MTD or Phase II recommended dose had been defined, up to 12 additional subjects with relapsed 
or  refractory  solid  tumours  were  to  be  enrolled  to  acquire  PK  data  using  the  powder  for  suspension 
formulation.  In Protocol Amendment 3, the maximum number of subjects in this strata was increased to 18 
subjects, to ensure 12 subjects with PK at the MTD with at least 6 subjects <12 years of age in this expanded 
cohort. 
Part 2b: Expanded Imaging Cohort 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/704739/2014 
Page 8/17 
 
  
  
Once the MTD or Phase II recommended dose had been defined, up to 10 additional subjects with recurrent 
or refractory (revised to relapsed or refractory in Protocol Amendment 1A) soft tissue sarcomas were to be 
enrolled to evaluate changes in vascular permeability using DCE-MRI.   
Statistical Methods 
Efficacy was a secondary objective of this study, best defined by the preliminary anti-tumour activity as 
assessed by disease response.  Summary statistics were produced to describe best response. 
Disease response was assessed using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) Version 
1.0 for measureable disease. Each subject was classified according to their “best response” for the purposes 
of  analysis  of  treatment  effect.  Two  objective  status  determinations  of  disease  status,  by  computer 
tomography  (CT)  or  magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI),  obtained  on  two  consecutive  determinations, 
separated by at least a 4-week time period, were required to determine the subject’s overall best response.

Part 1 and Part 2a were the dose escalation parts of the ADVL0815 (PZP114411) study.   
The starting pazopanib tablet dose in Part 1 was 275 mg/m2 and 2 to 6 evaluable subjects were enrolled at 
each dose level.  Part 2a investigated the safety and PK of pazopanib after administration as the suspension 
formulation.  The starting dose of the pazopanib suspension in Part 2a was 50% of the MTD or highest dose 
investigated in Part 1.  Once the MTD or recommended Phase II dose of pazopanib tablets was defined, up

to  10  additional  subjects  were  enrolled  in  Part  2b  (imaging  cohort)  to  explore  changes  in  vascular 
permeability using DCE-MRI. 
Serial blood samples for the determination of plasma pazopanib concentrations were collected over 24 h 
after a single dose (Day 1), and over 8 h after repeated oral doses on Day 15 or Day 22 in a subset of 
subjects (PK population).  Blood samples were collected at predose (trough) at the Days 15, 22, and 27 clinic 
visits, and just prior to starting subsequent odd-numbered cycles.   
The mean (range) age of subjects enrolled in Study ADVL0815 (PZP114411) was 13.1 (3 – 23) years.  A total 
of 22 (42%) subjects were aged between 2 and <12 years.  
Mean (range) body surface area was 1.37 (0.8 – 2.1) m2.  Oral pazopanib doses of 275 mg/m2, 350 mg/m2, 
450 mg/m2, and 600 mg/m2 as tablets were investigated.  Oral suspension doses of 160 mg/m2 and 225 
mg/m2 also were investigated.   
The pharmacokinetics of pazopanib in subjects in Study ADVL0815 (PZP114411) are summarized in Table 1.  
Predose (trough) plasma pazopanib concentration are summarized in Table 2.

4.2.3.  Efficacy Results 
Two (4%) subjects achieved a PR (Table 3).  Subject 794200, with desmoplastic small round cell tumour, 
achieved a PR after 5.5 months, which was sustained for 24 months.  Subject 774572, with hepatoblastoma 
and embryonal hepatoma, had a PR after 5.5 months and maintained this response for a further 5.5 months; 
however, they were removed from the study because of an AE.   
Twelve (23%) subjects had a best response of stable disease, and had the following diagnoses:   
• 
• 
• 
In Part 1: malignant melanoma (n=2), synovial sarcoma (n=2), alveolar soft part sarcoma, malignant 
glioma, osteosarcoma 
In Part 2a: desmoplastic small round cell tumour 
In  Part  2b:  alveolar  rhabdomyosarcoma  (n=2),  alveolar  soft  part  sarcoma,  gastrointestinal  stromal 
sarcoma. (All subjects in Part 2b had sarcoma.)

4.2.4.  Safety Results 
The primary objective of this study included defining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), evaluate toxicity 
and obtain initial pazopanib pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters in a paediatric patient population.   In addition 
to monitoring of AEs, monitoring of specific toxicities was performed for growth plate, thyroid and cardiac 
toxicity.

In total, 53 subjects entered the study.  All were included in the safety population and were evaluable for the 
analysis  of  safety.  Of  the  53 subjects  entered  into  the  study,  27 subjects  received  pazopanib  tablets  in 
Part 1, 16 subjects received a pazopanib suspension in Part 2a, and 10 subjects received pazopanib tablets 
(at the MTD) in Part 2b. All subjects discontinued study treatment.  The most common primary reason for 
discontinuation  from  study  treatment  was  disease  progression  (35 [66%] subjects),  followed  by  AEs 
(11 [21%] subjects). 
The planned duration of the protocol therapy was 24 cycles, with each cycle defined as 28 days in duration. 
Median exposure was 3.0 months (range: 1 to 23 months) across all groups. One subject in Part 2b received 
the maximum of 24 cycles of study treatment. 
Analysis of Adverse Events 
All subjects had at least one AE during the study and at least one AE that was considered   by the investigator 
related to study treatment (Table 4).  AEs led to withdrawal for 11 (21%) subjects.

AEs were also analysed by age group (2 to <12 years, 12 to <19 [i.e., up to and including 18] years, >18 
years [i.e. 19 years and above]), although interpretation is limited by the small number of subjects (n=22, 
22 and 12, respectively).

Of the most common AEs, AST increased and hyponatremia were the only AEs reported at a higher 
incidence in the 2 to <12 years group compared with the 12 to <19 or >18 years age groups (59%, 
compared with 41% and 33% , respectively, and 50% compared with 32% and 42%, respectively).   
Of the most common AEs, those reported at a higher incidence in the 12 to <19 years group compared 
with  the  2  to  <12 or  >18  years  age  groups  included  fatigue  (64%  compared  with  50%  and  58%, 
respectively), headache (55% compared with 36% and 42%, respectively), and hyperglycemia (55% 
compared with 41% and 42%, respectively) 
Of  the  most  common  AEs,  a  number  were  reported  at  a  higher  incidence  in  the  >18 years  group 
compared with the 2 to <12 or 12 to <19 years age groups (>15% difference).  These included ALT 
increased (75% compared with 41% and 41%, respectively), diarrhoea (83% compared with 41% and 
55%, respectively), lymphocyte count decreased (67% compared with 41% and 41%, respectively), 
platelet  count  decreased  (67%  compared  with  36%  and  41%,  respectively),  and  white  blood  cell 
decreased (75% compared with 59% and 50%, respectively). 
Seven (13%) subjects died and all had the primary cause of death reported as  disease under study Table 7.  
Only  one  primary  cause  of  death  was  given  for  each  subject  and  the  7  deaths  includes  the  3  subjects 
considered to have fatal SAEs.

Vital Signs, Physical Findings, and Other Observations Related to Safety 
Five subjects had an increase to Grade 2 diastolic blood pressure (DBP), 2 subjects had an increase to  Grade 
3 DBP and 2 subjects had increase to  Grade 2 systolic blood pressure (SBP). In addition 3 subjects had 
decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction or shortening fraction as noted on echocardiograms, and one 
subject had an AE of “cardiac disorder – other” reported.   
Growth plate toxicity was also monitored. A total of 36 (68%) subjects had an open tibial growth plate at 
screening. At least two knee radiographs were obtained and centrally reviewed for 27 subjects. One subject 
had a closed growth plate on central review, and the second was ineligible for the study.  Of the 26 subjects 
with open physes (median age, 11 years; range, 4 to 17 years), one 11-year old subject  had thickening of 
the growth plate. This was confirmed by MRI, and a decrease in height velocity. Three additional subjects  
aged 11, 8 and 4 years-old each had growth plate widening radiographically after 4 cycles of treatment, but 
were  discontinued  because  of  progressive  disease.  The  remaining  22  subjects    had  normal  radiographs, 
including 3 subjects receiving 8, 12, and 13 cycles. 
4.2.5.  Discussion & conclusion 
The  MAH  for  Votrient  (pazopanib)  has  submitted  a  variation  in  order  to  amend  the  SmPC,  Section  4.2, 
Paediatric population, to delete the sentence “No data are available”. 
With  the  variation  results  from  study  ADVL0815/PZP114411),  a  Phase  I  Study  of  Pazopanib  as  a  Single 
Agent  for  Children  with  Relapsed  or  Refractory  Solid  Tumours,  including  central  nervous  system  (CNS) 
tumours, has been included. The primary purpose of the phase I study ADVL0815 was to identify the MTD of 
pazopanib  for  administration  to  children,  adolescents  and  young  adults.  The  primary  objectives  were  to 
evaluate  toxicity  and  begin  the  process  of  characterising  pazopanib  PK  parameters  in  a  paediatric 
population.  Evaluation of clinical activity was a secondary objective. A total of 53 paediatric subjects with a 
variety of relapsed/refractory solid tumours were evaluated and reported.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/704739/2014 
Page 15/17 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
The  data  showed  that  plasma  pazopanib  concentrations  associated  with  clinical  and  biologic  effects 
consistent with VEGFR inhibition (20 µg/mL) were achieved at all dose levels after oral administration of 
tablets/suspension.  
Some clinical activity of pazopanib was observed in a heavily pretreated paediatric population.  
Clinical activity included 2 subjects with partial responses in refractory desmoplastic small round cell tumour 
and hepatoblastoma. Stable disease were seen in 12 subjects (23%) in a variety of tumour types (malignant 
melanoma (n=2), synovial sarcoma (n=2), alveolar soft part sarcoma, malignant glioma, osteosarcoma,  
desmoplastic  small  round  cell  tumour,  alveolar  rhabdomyosarcoma  (n=2),  alveolar  soft  part  sarcoma, 
gastrointestinal stromal sarcoma.  
Serious adverse events were reported for 25 (47%) subjects.  The most common SAEs were anaemia (4 
[8%] subjects), increased lipase (4 [8%] subjects), abdominal pain, dyspnoea and hypothyroidism (each in 
3 [6%] subjects). No other SAEs were reported for greater than 2 subjects. Decreases in left ventricular 
ejection fraction were reported for 9 (17%) subjects, 3/17 at the MTD for tablets and none at the MTD for the 
suspension.  All (3) fatal SAEs had the primary cause of death related to their disease.  The types of AEs 
observed was consistent with those seen in the adult population treated with pazopanib.    
Overall conclusion 
It can be agreed that based on the data from this small paediatric study no firm conclusion can be drawn 
about activity nor safety  in particular tumour types and consequently efficacy of pazopanib in children aged 
2 to 18 years of age based on the data from this study has not yet been established. The overall efficacy and 
safety profile of pazopanib remains unchanged.   
With the provided data the statement currently included in the SmPC section 4.2; “no data are available” is 
no longer appropriate. It is also endorsed that even though some information is now available the overall  
paediatric data regarding safety and tolerability of pazopanib are still limited and therefore the conclusion 
“that safety and efficacy of pazopanib in children aged 2 to 18 years have not been established” remains 
unchanged. 
However, it could be considered of value to evaluate the data by comparing the PK data/parameters in adults 
with those in children of the various age categories (2-6, 6-12, 12-18 years and >18 years) taking into 
account possible differences in formulation and absolute doses and provide some level of paediatric PK data 
in section 5.2 of the SmPC. 
4.3.  Changes to the Product Information 
As a result of this variation, section 4.2 of the SmPC is updated. The proposal is considered appropriate. 
Please refer to Attachment 1 which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information. 
5.  Request for supplementary information

6.  Assessment of the responses to the request for 
supplementary information 
Question 1 
It could be considered of value to evaluate the data by comparing the PK data/parameters in 
adults  with  those  in  children  of  the  various  age  categories  (2-6,  6-12,  12-18  years  and  >18 
years) taking into account possible differences in formulation and absolute doses and provide 
some level of paediatric PK data in section 5.2 of the SmPC. 
Response: 
VOTRIENT does not currently have an indication in the paediatric population; however, GSK agrees that 
paediatric pharmacokinetic data could be of value. To that end, the available data were reviewed. 
The breakdown of the pharmacokinetic results of the children by age categories, formulation, and dose from 
Study ADVL0815/PZP114411 (a phase I study of pazopanib as a single agent for children with relapsed or 
refractory solid tumours, including central nervous system (CNS) tumours) is shown in Table 1. As can be 
observed from the information in the table, the sample size for each age category is very small therefore the 
data are not amenable for a summary in the SmPC to provide relevant pharmacokinetic data to a prescriber 
at this time. 
GSK  will continue to collect and  review data  from ongoing paediatric studies and will inform the  EMA of 
relevant data in this population as they become available. 
Conclusion 
The  MAH  as  provided  their  response  to  the  one  outstanding  issue.  As  highlighted  by  the  MAH  Votrient 
(pazopanib)  is  not  approved  for  the  use  in  the  paediatric  population,  and  the  numbers  on  which  any 
pharmacokinetic information may be based on and subsequently addressed in section 4.2 is very limited. 
Thus the conclusion of the MAH, that nothing further may be included in section 5.2 in the SmPC is endorsed. 
X  Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly 
 No need to update overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance

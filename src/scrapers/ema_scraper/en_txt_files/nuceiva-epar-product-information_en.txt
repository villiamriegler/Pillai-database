White powder. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
NUCEIVA is indicated for the temporary improvement in the appearance of moderate to severe 
vertical lines between the eyebrows seen at maximum frown (glabellar lines), when the severity of the 
above facial lines has an important psychological impact in adults below 65 years of age. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
NUCEIVA should only be administered by physicians with appropriate qualifications and expertise in 
the treatment of glabellar lines and the use of required equipment. 
Posology 
The recommended injection per muscle site is 4 U/0.1 mL. Five injection sites (see Figure 1): 2 
injections in each corrugator muscle (inferior medial and superior medial aspect) and 1 injection in the 
procerus muscle for a total dose of 20 Units. 
Botulinum toxin units are not interchangeable from one product to another. Doses recommended are 
different from other botulinum toxin preparations. 
In the absence of adverse reactions during the initial treatment, an additional course of treatment can 
be performed subject to a minimum interval of 3 months between the initial and repeat treatment. 
In the event of treatment failure (no visible improvement of glabellar lines at maximum frown) one 
month after the first course of treatment, the following approaches may be considered: 
• 
• 
Examination of the causes of failure, e.g. inappropriate injection technique, incorrect muscles 
injected, and formation of botulinum toxin-neutralising antibodies. 
Re-evaluation of the appropriateness of treatment with botulinum toxin type A.  
The efficacy and safety of repeat injections beyond 12 months has not been evaluated.

Elderly patients 
There are limited clinical data with NUCEIVA in patients older than 65 years (see section 5.1). 
NUCEIVA is not recommended for use in patients over 65 years of age.  
No specific dose adjustment is required for use in the elderly. 
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of NUCEIVA in the paediatric population.  
Method of administration 
Intramuscular use. 
Once reconstituted, NUCEIVA should only be used to treat a single patient, during a single session.  
Precaution to be taken before manipulating or administering the product 
For instructions for use, precaution before manipulating or administering the product, handling and 
disposal of the vials, see section 6.6. 
Care should be taken to ensure that NUCEIVA is not injected into a blood vessel when it is injected in 
the vertical lines between the eyebrows seen at maximum frown (also known as glabellar lines) (see 
section 4.4). 
Physical manipulation (such as rubbing) of the injection site in the immediate post-administration 
period should be avoided. 
Administration instructions for Glabellar Lines seen at maximum frown 
Reconstituted NUCEIVA (50 Units/1.25 mL ; 100 Units/2.5 mL) is injected using a sterile 30 gauge 
needle.  
In order to reduce the complication of eyelid ptosis the following steps should be taken: 
• 
• 
• 
Two injections should be administered in each corrugator muscle (inferior medial and superior 
medial aspect) and 1 injection in the procerus muscle for a total dose of 20 Units. 
Injection near the levator palpebrae superioris should be avoided, particularly in patients with 
larger brow depressor complexes. 
Lateral corrugator injections should be placed at least 1 cm above the bony supraorbital ridge. 
4.3  Contraindications 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Generalised disorders of muscle activity (e.g. myasthenia gravis or Eaton Lambert Syndrome) 
Infection or inflammation at the proposed injection sites. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
General 
The anatomy and anatomical land marks of procerus corrugator supercilli muscles and the surrounding 
vasucular and nervous structures in the glabellar region must be understood prior to administration of 
NUCEIVA. Injection into vulnerable anatomical structures, such as nerves and blood vessels, must be 
avoided. 
Localised pain, inflammation, paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia, tenderness, swelling/oedema, erythema, 
localised infection, bleeding and/or bruising have been associated with the injection. Needle-related 
pain and/or anxiety have resulted in vasovagal responses, including transient symptomatic hypotension 
and syncope. 
Caution should be taken when the targeted muscle shows pronouced weakness or atrophy. 
Care should be taken to ensure that NUCEIVA is not injected into a blood vessel when it is injected in 
the glabellar lines seen at maximum frown (see section 4.2). 
There is a risk of eyelid ptosis following treatment (see section 4.2). 
Caution should be taken if complications have resulted with previous botulinum toxin injections.  
Bleeding disorders 
Caution should be exercised when NUCEIVA is used in patients with bleeding disorders as injection 
may lead to bruising. 
Local and distant spread of toxin effect 
Adverse reactions possibly related to the spread of toxin distant from the site of administration have 
been reported very rarely with botulinum toxin (see section 4.8). Swallowing and breathing difficulties 
are serious and can result in death. Injection of NUCEIVA is not recommended in patients with a 
history of dysphagia and aspiration. 
Patients or caregivers should be advised to seek immediate medical care if swallowing, speech or 
respiratory disorders arise. 
Pre-existing neuromuscular disorders 
Patients with unrecognised neuromuscular disorders may be at increased risk of clinically significant 
systemic effects, including severe dysphagia and respiratory compromise from typical doses of 
botulinum toxin type A. In some of these cases, dysphagia has lasted several months and required 
placement of a gastric feeding tube (see section 4.3). 
Caution should also be exercised when botulinum toxin type A is used for treatment of patients with 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or with peripheral neuromuscular disorders. 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
An anaphylactic reaction may occur very rarely after injection of botulinum toxin. Epinephrine 
(adrenaline) or any other anti-anaphylactic measures should therefore be available. 
Antibody formation 
Antibodies to botulinum toxin type A may develop during treatment with botulinum toxin. Some of 
the antibodies formed are neutralising which may lead to treatment failure of botulinum toxin type A. 
It is mandatory that NUCEIVA is used for one single patient treatment only during a single session. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. 
Theoretically, the effect of botulinum toxin may be potentiated by aminoglycoside antibiotics, 
spectinomycin, or other medicinal products that interfere with neuromuscular transmission (e.g. 
neuromuscular blocking medicinal products). 
The effect of administering different botulinum neurotoxin serotypes at the same time or within 
several months of each other is unknown. Excessive neuromuscular weakness may be exacerbated by 
administration of another botulinum toxin prior to the resolution of the effects of a previously 
administered botulinum toxin. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no adequate data from the use of botulinum toxin type A in pregnant women. Animal studies 
are insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). NUCEIVA is not recommended 
during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. 
Breast-feeding 
There is no information on whether NUCEIVA is excreted in human breast milk. NUCEIVA should 
not be used during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
The effect of NUCEIVA on human fertility is unknown. However, another botulinum toxin type A has 
been shown to impair the fertility of male and female animals. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
NUCEIVA has a minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. There is a 
potential risk for asthenia, muscle weakness, dizziness and visual disturbance, which could affect 
driving and the operation of machinery. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Serious undesirable effects that may occur following treatment with NUCEIVA include eyelid ptosis, 
an immune response, distant spread of toxin, development or exacerbation of a neuromuscular disorder, 
and  hypersensitivity  reactions.  The  most  commonly  reported  adverse  effects  during  treatment  are 
headache, occurring in 9.0% of patients, followed by eyelid ptosis, occurring in 1.0% of patients.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Application related adverse reactions 
Application related undesirable effects that have been reported following administration of NUCEIVA 
are uncommon events individually, common when added together. These include application and 
injection site bruising, injection site pain and injection site swelling. Rarely occurring injection site 
events that have been reported include erythema, paraesthesia, pruritis, pain and tenderness.  
Undesirable effects of the substance class botulinum toxin type A 
Muscle atrophy 
Muscle atrophy is expected after repeated botulinum treatment secondary to the flaccid paralysis of the 
treated muscles. 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Toxin spread 
Adverse reactions possibly related to the spread of toxin distant from the site of administration have 
been reported very rarely with botulinum toxin (e.g. muscle weakness, breathing difficulties, dysphagia 
or constipation) (see section 4.4). 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
An  anaphylactic  reaction  may  occur  very  rarely  after  injection  of  botulinum  toxin.  Epinephrine 
(adrenaline) or any other anti-anaphylactic measures should therefore be available. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Symptoms of overdose 
Signs of overdose may not be apparent immediately post-injection. Should accidental injection or 
ingestion occur, the patient should be medically monitored for several days for signs and symptoms of 
general weakness or muscle paralysis. Admission to hospital should be considered in patients 
presenting with symptoms of botulinum toxin type A poisoning (generalised weakness, ptosis, 
diplopia, swallowing and speech disorders, or paresis of the respiratory muscles). 
Too frequent or excessive dosing may enhance the risk of antibody formation. Antibody formation 
may lead to treatment failure.  
Overdose of NUCEIVA depends upon dose, site of injection, and underlying tissue properties. No 
cases of systemic toxicity resulting from accidental injection of botulinum toxin type A have been 
observed. Excessive doses may produce local or distant generalised and profound neuromuscular 
paralysis. No cases of ingestion of botulinum toxin type A have been reported. 
Management of overdose 
In the event of overdose the patient should be medically monitored for symptoms of excessive muscle 
weakness or muscle paralysis. Symptomatic treatment should be instigated if necessary.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Muscle relaxants, other muscle relaxants, peripherally acting agents, ATC 
code: M03AX01. 
Mechanism of action 
Botulinum toxin type A (Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin) blocks peripheral acetylcholine release at 
presynaptic cholinergic nerve terminals by cleaving SNAP-25, a protein integral to the successful 
docking and release of acetylcholine from vesicles situated within the nerve endings, thereby leading 
to denervation of the muscle and a flaccid paralysis. 
After injection, there is an initial rapid high-affinity binding of toxin to specific cell surface receptors. 
This is followed by transfer of the toxin across the plasma membrane by receptor-mediated 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
endocytosis. Finally, the toxin is released into the cytosol with progressive inhibition of acetylcholine 
release. Clinical signs are manifest within 2-3 days, with peak effect seen within 4 weeks of injection. 
Recovery after intramuscular injection takes place normally within 12 weeks of injection as nerve 
terminals sprout and reconnect with the endplates.  
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Glabellar lines 
540 patients with moderate to severe glabellar lines seen at maximum frown who felt their glabellar 
lines had an important psychological impact (on mood, anxiety/or depressive symptoms) have been 
included in the European/Canadian clinical study. 
NUCEIVA injections significantly reduced the severity of glabellar lines by 1 point or greater at 
maximum frown for up to 139 days, as measured by the investigator assessment of glabellar line 
severity at maximum frown.

There are limited phase 3 clinical data with NUCEIVA in patients older than 65 years.  
Duration of response in the phase 3 study was 139 days, based on a 1 point GLS improvement. 
A total of 922 patients participated in two 1 year open label uncontrolled studies, and over the course 
of these studies, the average patient received 3 treatments.  
The psychological impact of glabellar lines was confirmed at study entry and although a beneficial 
effect could not be demonstrated on psychological wellbeing, significant effects on patient reported 
outcomes were demonstrated as compared to placebo. Further, the effects of NUCEIVA on 
psychological wellbeing and patient reported outcomes were comparable to BOTOX, the active 
control used in the pivotal study.  
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
NUCEIVA has not been detected in the peripheral blood following intramuscular injection at the 
recommended dose. 
Absorption, distribution, biotransformation and elimination (ADME) studies on the active substance 
have not been performed due to the nature of this product.

5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of acute and 
repeat dose toxicity. 
Reproduction toxicity 
The potential impact of NUCEIVA on fertility has not been investigated in animals. In pregnant rats, 
daily intramuscular injections of 0.5, 1, or 4 Units/kg during the period of organogenesis (from 
gestation days 6 to 16), did not induce significant test article-related toxicological effects on the dams 
and on embryo-fetal development. Effects on peri-/postnatal development have not been evaluated.

The central part of the rubber cap should be cleaned with alcohol. 
The solution is prepared by injecting the solvent slowly into the vial with a needle through the 
rubber stopper and by gently  rotating the vial avoiding bubble formation. The vial has to be 
discarded if the vacuum does not pull the solvent into  the vial. Once reconstituted, the solution 
should be visually inspected prior to use. Only clear, colorless solution without particles should be 
used. 
Reconstituted NUCEIVA (50 Units/1.25 mL ; 100 Units/2.5 mL) is injected using a sterile 30 gauge 
needle. Four Units (4 U/ 0.1 mL) are administered in each of the 5 injection sites (see Figure 1): 2 
injections in each corrugator muscle (inferior medial and superior medial aspect) and 1 injection in the 
procerus muscle for a total dose of 20 Units. 
It is mandatory that NUCEIVA is used for one single patient treatment only during a single session. 
Procedure to follow for a safe disposal of vials, syringes and materials used: 
Immediately after use, and prior to disposal, unused reconstituted NUCEIVA solution in the vial 
and/or the syringe must be inactivated, with 2 mL of dilute sodium hypochlorite solution at 0.5% or 
1% (Javel solution) and should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. 
Used vials, syringes, and materials should not be emptied and must be discarded into appropriate 
containers and disposed as a Medical Biohazardous Waste in accordance with local requirements. 
Recommendations in the event of an accident when handling botulinum toxin: 
In the event of an accident when handling the product, whether in the vacuum-dried state or 
reconstituted, the appropriate measures described below must be initiated immediately. 
• 
• 
The toxin is very sensitive to heat and certain chemical agents. 
Any spillage must be wiped up: either with an absorbent material soaked in a solution of sodium 
hypochlorite (Javel solution) in the case of the vacuum-dried product, or with a dry absorbent 
material in the case of the reconstituted product. 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Contaminated surfaces must be cleaned with an absorbent material soaked in a solution of 
sodium hypochlorite (Javel solution) and then dried. 
If a vial is broken, carefully collect the pieces of glass and wipe up the product as stated above, 
avoiding cuts to the skin. 
If splashed on skin, wash with a solution of sodium hypochlorite and then rinse thoroughly with 
plenty of water. 
If splashed into the eyes, rinse eyes thoroughly with plenty of water or with an eye wash 
solution. 
If the injector injures himself (cuts, pricks himself), proceed as above and take the appropriate medical 
steps.  
These instructions for use, handling, and disposal should be strictly followed.

Package leaflet: Information for the user 
NUCEIVA 50 Units powder for solution for injection  
botulinum toxin type A 
Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains 
important information for you. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  
If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, 
even if their signs of illness are the same as yours.  
If you have any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. 
What is in this leaflet 
1.  What NUCEIVA is and what it is used for  
2.  What you need to know before NUCEIVA is used 
3.  How to use NUCEIVA  
4.  Possible side effects  
5.  How to store NUCEIVA  
6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What NUCEIVA is and what it is used for 
NUCEIVA contains the active substance botulinum toxin type A. 
It prevents muscles from contracting, leading to a temporary paralysis. It works  by blocking the  nerve 
impulses  to  the  muscles  in  which  it  has  been injected. 
NUCEIVA is used for the temporary improvement in the appearance of vertical lines between the 
eyebrows. It is used in adults less than 65 years of age in whom those facial lines have an important 
psychological impact. 
2.  What you need to know before NUCEIVA is used 
NUCEIVA must not be used: 
- 
if you are allergic to botulinum toxin type A or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6); 
if you have myasthenia gravis or Eaton  Lambert syndrome (chronic  diseases  affecting the 
muscles); 
if you have an infection or inflammation at the proposed injection sites. 
- 
- 
Warnings and precautions  
Side effects possibly related to the spread of botulinum toxin from the site of injection can occur very 
rarely (e.g. muscle weakness, difficulty in swallowing or food or liquid entering the airways). Patients 
receiving recommended doses may have exaggerated muscle weakness. 
Visit your doctor immediately if you find it difficult to swallow, to speak or to breathe after treatment.  
- 
- 
- 
- 
NUCEIVA is not recommended in patients who have had problems swallowing (dysphagia) and 
breathing. 
Too frequent or excessive dosing may lead to antibody formation. Antibody formation can stop 
botulinum toxin type A from working even for other uses. To prevent this, there must be a gap 
of at least three months between doses. 
Very rarely, an allergic reaction can occur after the injection of botulinum toxin. 
Drooping of the eyelid may occur after treatment. 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Please tell your doctor if: 
- 
- 
- 
you had problems with previous botulinum toxin injections; 
you see no significant improvement of your lines one month after your first course of treatment; 
you suffer from certain diseases affecting your nervous system (such as amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis or motor neuropathy); 
you have inflammation at the proposed injection site(s); 
the muscles to be injected are weak or wasted; 
you have a bleeding disorder as injection may lead to bruising. 
- 
- 
- 
Children and adolescents 
The use of NUCEIVA is not recommended in individuals under 18 years. 
Other medicines and NUCEIVA 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.  
The use of botulinum toxin is not recommended in association with aminoglycoside antibiotics, 
spectinomycin or other medicines that interfere with nerve impulses to the muscle. 
Tell your doctor if you have recently been injected with a medicine containing botulinum toxin (the 
active substance of NUCEIVA), as this may increase the effect of NUCEIVA excessively. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby ask 
your doctor for advice before you receive this medicine. 
The use of NUCEIVA is not recommended during pregnancy and in women able to have children who 
are not using contraception.  
NUCEIVA is not recommended in breast-feeding women. 
Driving and using machines 
Muscle weakness, dizziness, and visual disturbance with this medicine could make driving or the use 
of machines dangerous. Do not drive or use machinery until such effects have cleared. 
NUCEIVA contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose; this means it is essentially 
‘sodium- free’. 
3. 
How to use NUCEIVA 
Unit doses for NUCEIVA are not interchangeable with those used for other preparations of botulinum 
toxin. 
NUCEIVA should only be injected by physicians with appropriate qualifications and expertise in the 
treatment of glabellar lines at maximum frown. 
The usual dose of NUCEIVA is 20 Units. You will be injected with the recommended volume of 
0.1 millilitre (ml) (4 Units) of NUCEIVA into each of 5 injection sites. 
Improvement of severity of the lines between the eyebrows generally occurs within a few days of 
treatment. 
The interval between treatments will be decided by your doctor. 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
How NUCEIVA is injected  
NUCEIVA is injected into your muscles (intramuscularly), directly into the affected area above and 
between the eyebrows. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
In general, side effects occur within the first few days after injection and are temporary. Most side 
effects are of mild to moderate severity. 
If you have any difficulty in breathing, swallowing or speaking after receiving NUCEIVA contact 
your doctor immediately.  
If you get hives, swelling, including swelling of the face or throat, wheezing, feeling faint or shortness 
of breath, contact your doctor immediately. 
The chance of having a side effect is described by the following categories: 
Common 
Headache, muscle imbalance resulting in elevated or asymmetrical eyebrows, 
eyelid drooping, injection site bruise 
(May affect up to 1 
in 10 people) 
Uncommon  
(May affect up to 1 
in 100 people) 
Sensory disturbance, head discomfort, dry eye, eyelid swelling, eye swelling, 
muscle twitching, injection site: redness, pain, tingling 
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system

THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS INTENDED FOR MEDICAL OR HEALTHCARE 
PROFESSIONALS ONLY: 
Botulinum toxin units are not interchangeable from one product to another. Doses recommended in 
units are different from other botulinum toxin preparations. 
Reconstitution should be performed in accordance with good clinical practice, particularly with respect 
to aseptic technique. NUCEIVA is reconstituted with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for 
injection. 1.25 mL of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection is drawn up into a syringe 
in order to obtain a reconstituted solution for injection at a concentration of 4 Units/0.1 mL. 
Amount of solvent added to 50 Unit vial  
(sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection) 
1.25 mL  
Resulting dose  
(Units per 0.1 mL) 
4.0 U 
The central part of the rubber cap should be cleaned with alcohol. Inject the diluent slowly into the vial 
with a needle through the rubber stopper and gently rotate the vial avoiding bubble formation. The vial 
has to be discarded if the vacuum does not pull the diluent into the vial. Once reconstituted, the 
solution for injection should be visually inspected prior to use to verify it is a clear, colourless solution 
free of particulate matter. 
Reconstituted NUCEIVA (50 Units/1.25 mL) is injected using a sterile 30 gauge needle. Four Units 
(4 U/ 0.1 mL) are administered  in each of the 5 injection sites (see Figure 1): 2 injections in each 
corrugator muscle (inferior medial and superior medial aspect) and 1 injection in the procerus  muscle 
for a total dose of 20 Units. 
34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In order to reduce the complication of eyelid ptosis the following steps should be taken: 
- 
- 
- 
Avoid injection near the levator palpebrae superioris, particularly in patients with larger brow 
depressor complexes. 
Lateral corrugator injections should be placed at least 1 cm above the bony supraorbital ridge. 
Ensure the injected volume/dose is accurate and where feasible kept to a minimum. 
Procedure to follow for safe disposal of vials, syringes and materials used: 
Immediately after use, unused reconstituted NUCEIVA solution for injection in the vial and/or the 
syringe must be inactivated, prior to disposal, with 2 mL of dilute sodium hypochlorite solution at 0.5% 
or 1% available chlorine.  Following inactivation, dispose of in accordance with local requirements. 
Used vials, syringes and materials should not be emptied and must be discarded into appropriate 
containers and disposed of according to local regulations. 
Recommendations in the event of an accident when handling botulinum toxin: 
In the event of an accident when handling the product, whether in the vacuum-dried state or 
reconstituted, the appropriate measures described below must be initiated immediately. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
The toxin is very sensitive to heat and certain chemical agents. 
Any spillage must be wiped up: either with an absorbent material soaked in a solution of sodium 
hypochlorite (Javel solution) in the case of the vacuum-dried product, or with a dry absorbent 
material in the case of the reconstituted product. 
Contaminated surfaces must be cleaned with an absorbent material soaked in a solution of 
sodium hypochlorite (Javel solution) and then dried. 
If a vial is broken, carefully collect the pieces of glass and wipe up the product as stated above, 
avoiding cuts to the skin. 
If splashed, wash with a solution of sodium hypochlorite and then rinse thoroughly with plenty of 
water. 
If splashed into the eyes, rinse eyes thoroughly with plenty of water or with an eye wash solution. 
If the operator injures himself (cuts, pricks himself), proceed as above and take the appropriate 
medical steps according to the dose injected. 
These instructions for use, handling and disposal should be strictly followed.

THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS INTENDED FOR MEDICAL OR HEALTHCARE 
PROFESSIONALS ONLY: 
Botulinum toxin units are not interchangeable from one product to another. Doses recommended in 
units are different from other botulinum toxin preparations. 
Reconstitution should be performed in accordance with good clinical practice, particularly with respect 
to aseptic technique. NUCEIVA is reconstituted with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for 
injection. 2.5 mL of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection is drawn up into a syringe 
in order to obtain a reconstituted solution for injection at a concentration of 4 Units/0.1 mL. 
Amount of diluent added to 100 Unit vial 
(sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection) 
2.5 mL 
Resulting dose 
(Units per 0.1 mL) 
4.0 U 
The central part of the rubber cap should be cleaned with alcohol. Inject the diluent slowly into the vial 
with a needle through the rubber stopper and gently rotate the vial avoiding bubble formation. The vial 
has to be discarded if the vacuum does not pull the diluent into the vial. Once reconstituted, the 
solution for injection should be visually inspected prior to use to verify it is a clear, colourless solution 
free of particulate matter. 
Reconstituted NUCEIVA (100 Units/2.5 mL) is injected using a sterile 30 gauge needle. Four Units 
(4 U/ 0.1 mL) are administered  in each of the 5 injection sites (see Figure 1): 2 injections in each 
corrugator muscle (inferior medial and superior medial aspect) and 1 injection in the procerus  muscle 
for a total dose of 20 Units. 
39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In order to reduce the complication of eyelid ptosis the following steps should be taken: 
- 
- 
- 
Avoid injection near the levator palpebrae superioris, particularly in patients with larger brow 
depressor complexes. 
Lateral corrugator injections should be placed at least 1 cm above the bony supraorbital ridge. 
Ensure the injected volume/dose is accurate and where feasible kept to a minimum. 
Procedure to follow for safe disposal of vials, syringes and materials used: 
Immediately after use, unused reconstituted NUCEIVA solution for injection in the vial and/or the 
syringe must be inactivated, prior to disposal, with 2 mL of dilute sodium hypochlorite solution at 0.5% 
or 1% available chlorine.  Following inactivation, dispose of in accordance with local requirements. 
Used vials, syringes and materials should not be emptied and must be discarded into appropriate 
containers and disposed of according to local regulations. 
Recommendations in the event of an accident when handling botulinum toxin: 
In the event of an accident when handling the product, whether in the vacuum-dried state or 
reconstituted, the appropriate measures described below must be initiated immediately. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
The toxin is very sensitive to heat and certain chemical agents. 
Any spillage must be wiped up: either with an absorbent material soaked in a solution of sodium 
hypochlorite (Javel solution) in the case of the vacuum-dried product, or with a dry absorbent 
material in the case of the reconstituted product. 
Contaminated surfaces must be cleaned with an absorbent material soaked in a solution of 
sodium hypochlorite (Javel solution) and then dried. 
If a vial is broken, carefully collect the pieces of glass and wipe up the product as stated above, 
avoiding cuts to the skin. 
If splashed, wash with a solution of sodium hypochlorite and then rinse thoroughly with plenty of 
water. 
If splashed into the eyes, rinse eyes thoroughly with plenty of water or with an eye wash solution. 
If the operator injures himself (cuts, pricks himself), proceed as above and take the appropriate 
medical steps according to the dose injected. 
These instructions for use, handling and disposal should be strictly followed.

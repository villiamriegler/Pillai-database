2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This application concerns a fixed drug combination product (FDC) presented for clinical use in vials 
containing ceftazidime 2 g and avibactam 0.5 g (CAZ-AVI), to be reconstituted and diluted for thrice 
daily infusions, each over 2 h in 100 mL volumes. The rationale for the FDC rests on the activity of 
ceftazidime (CAZ) against a wide range of aerobic Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria and the ability of 
avibactam (AVI), a non-β-lactam β-lactamase inhibitor, to protect CAZ from hydrolysis by a wide range 
of serine β-lactamases. Importantly, the range of inhibition of AVI includes class A ESBLs and 
carbapenemases (e.g. KPCs), class C β-lactamases and some class D oxacillinases and 
carbapenemases.   
Ceftazidime was first licensed in the EU during the 1980s for a wide range of indications. An Article 30 
procedure was completed during 2012. The development of AVI was initially undertaken by Novexel, 
which was later acquired by AstraZeneca. AstraZeneca and Forest Laboratories then entered into an 
agreement to co-develop CAZ-AVI. AstraZeneca has responsibility for CAZ-AVI in the EU. 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
β-lactamases are a major cause of resistance to beta-lactam antibacterial agents in infections caused 
by Gram-negative pathogens. Many of these enzymes are carried on transferable elements (i.e. 
plasmids), which facilitate rapid transmission of resistance within and across bacterial species. This 
characteristic, coupled with the fact that infections caused by β-lactam resistant pathogens are already 
widespread in the hospital and community setting, means that continued proliferation of treatment-
resistance can be expected (Carlet et al 2012). 
The microbiology of serious infections varies depending on the host, type of infection, and the location 
(geographic location and hospital vs outpatient) where the infection was acquired. However, certain 
pathogens are clearly predisposed to acquire and spread resistance. Enterobacteriaceae (particularly 
Escherichia coli and K. pneumoniae) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are commonly associated with β-
lactamase-mediated resistance irrespective of the site of infection (Morrissey et al 2013; Jones 2010; 
Giske et al 2008; Boucher et al 2009). Acinetobacter spp., particularly A. baumannii, are also 
commonly associated with resistance to β-lactams; although these species acquire β-lactamases, they 
are also intrinsically resistant to many β-lactams due to their selective ability to exclude various 
molecules from penetrating their outer membrane (ECDC 2012). 
In the 2012 European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) microbiological surveillance 
report, 11.8% of E. coli isolates and 25.7% of K. pneumoniae isolates were resistant to 3rd generation 
cephalosporins. In both cases this represents a statistically significant increase from the same figures 
in 2009 (EU/EEA means: 8.2% and 21.5%, respectively [ECDC 2012]). 
Resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins has been developing over two decades. It is most 
often caused by ESBLs, but may also be conferred by plasmid-mediated or chromosomally hyper-
produced AmpC-type enzymes. Plasmids that encode ESBL genes often carry other resistance genes 
too, meaning that ESBL producing pathogens are commonly resistant to other classes (MacVane et al 
2014). Thus, increasing resistance to cephalosporins conferred by ESBLs has coincided with increasing 
combined resistance to other antimicrobial groups. In the 2012 ECDC surveillance report, 4.4% of E. 
coli isolates and 18.5% of K. pneumoniae isolates possessed combined resistance to cephalosporins, 
aminoglycoside and fluoroquinolones; combined resistance rates were as high as 16.1% and 59.9%, 
respectively, in individual EU countries. This pattern of increasing resistance has significantly limited

treatment options in patients with suspected ESBL infections and often only carbapenems remain 
suitable for empiric use. 
Carbapenemases are another increasingly common mechanism for resistance to β-lactams among the 
Enterobacteriaceae; these cause resistance to carbapenems as well as other β-lactams (Nordmann 
2014). There are serine-based enzymes (mainly Ambler class A) and metallo- (also referred to as zinc) 
based enzymes. The most prevalent group of serine enzymes have been described as “KPCs” because 
they were first encountered in K. pneumoniae, however, the genes that code for these enzymes are 
spread amongst Enterobacteriaceae (Nordmann 2014).  
ECDC surveillance data for healthcare associated infections across Europe reported that overall 7.6% 
of Enterobacteriaceae were non-susceptible to carbapenems (ECDC 2013). The highest rates of 
carbapenem resistance are routinely found in Greece, where 60.5% of K. pneumoniae isolates from 
hospitals have been reported to be resistant to carbapenems. Across Europe, there has been a 
statistically significant increase in EU/EEA population-weighted mean percentage of carbapenem-
resistant K. pneumoniae from 3.2% in 2009 to 6.2% in 2012. Carbapenem resistance is generally 
associated with combined resistance to cephalosporins, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones (ECDC 
2012). It is also increasingly evident that carbapenem-resistance can be conferred through other 
mechanisms besides carbapenemases (e.g. AmpC enzymes and pathogens that possess an ESBL in 
combination with mechanisms that limit carbapenem entry into the cell [Huang et al 2013; Lopez-
Camacho et al 2014; Robert et al 2014]). 
2.1.2.  About the product  
Ceftazidime-avibactam  (CAZ-AVI;  CAZ104)  is  a  β-lactam/β-lactamase  fixed  drug  combination  (FDC) 
of: 
o  Avibactam (NXL104; AVE1330A) is a novel non-β-lactam β-lactamase inhibitor with a spectrum 
of activity encompassing β-lactamases of class A and class C, including ESBLs and serine-
based carbapenemases (KPCs). It also inhibits some class D β-lactamases (e.g. OXA-48 type 
carbapenemase). Avibactam has no inhibitory effect on class B metallo-β-lactamases. 
o  Ceftazidime is a cephalosporin that is approved in the EU for the treatment of complicated 
intra-abdominal infection (cIAI), complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI), nosocomial 
pneumonia (NP) and a range of other infections. It has no appreciable antibacterial activity 
against Gram-positive pathogens, with the exception of some streptococci, or anaerobes. 
The proposed indications for adults are: 
•  Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infection (cIAI) 
•  Complicated Urinary Tract Infection (cUTI), including pyelonephritis  
•  Hospital-acquired pneumonia including ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) 
• 
Infections due to aerobic Gram-negative organisms in patients with limited treatment

only after consultation with a physician with appropriate experience in the management of infectious 
diseases (see section 4.4). 
Special populations 
Elderly  
No dosage adjustment is considered necessary in elderly patients (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
In patients with mild renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance CrCL 50-> 80 mL/min) no dose 
adjustment is necessary (see section 5.2). 
The following dose adjustments are recommended in patients with estimated CrCL ≤ 50 mL/min (see

2 Dose recommendations are based on pharmacokinetic modelling 
3 Ceftazidime and avibactam are removed by haemodialysis (see sections 4.9 and 5.2). Dosing of 
Zavicefta on haemodialysis days should occur after completion of haemodialysis. 
Haemodialysis 
Both ceftazidime and avibactam are haemodialyzable; thus, Zavicefta should be administered after 
haemodialysis on haemodialysis days (see Table 2). 
Haemofiltration 
There is insufficient data to make specific dosage adjustment recommendations for patients 
undergoing continuous veno-venous haemofiltration. 
Peritoneal dialysis 
There is insufficient data to make specific dosage adjustment recommendations for patients 
undergoing peritoneal dialysis. 
Hepatic impairment 
No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).  
Paediatric population 
Safety and efficacy in children and adolescents below 18 years of age have not yet been established. 
No data are available. 
Method of administration  
Zavicefta is administered by intravenous infusion over 120 minutes in an infusion volume of 100 mL 
(see section 6.6). 
For instructions on reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product before administration (see 
section 6.6). 
Class D OXA β-lactamases are also increasingly reported in Enterobacteriaceae. Amongst these, OXA-
48 is of particular concern due to its carbapenem-hydrolysing activity. OXA-48 has recently started to 
spread in Europe and the Middle East (Potron et al 2013). Many OXA-48 expressing strains of bacteria 
are susceptible to ceftazidime, which is relatively stable to hydrolysis by OXA-48 itself, but OXA-48 
strains can co-express ESBLs and narrow spectrum β-lactamases with ceftazidime hydrolysing activity. 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a major cause of infection in hospitalised patients. Resistance can be 
intrinsic (e.g. chromosomally-encoded β-lactamases) or acquired (including serine- and metallo-β-
lactamases), and is often mediated by interplay of various mechanisms that lead to resistance to β-
lactams, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones. Carbapenem resistance is common in the EU 
(population-adjusted mean percentage of 17.1% [range 3.2% to 51.2%]: ECDC 2012). Combined 
resistance is also common: in the 2012 ECDC surveillance report, 13.8% of the isolates were resistant 
to at least 3 antimicrobial groups and 5.8% of the isolates were resistant to all 5 antimicrobial classes 
under surveillance (ECDC 2012). Of particular relevance is mutational derepression of the 
chromosomally coded AmpC β-lactamase, which can confer resistance to cephalosporins that are active 
against P. aeruginosa. This beta-lactamase is not inhibited by existing inhibitors such as tazobactam. 
Furthermore, acquisition of plasmid-mediated resistance genes coding for various β-lactamases and 
aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes can confer resistance to various β-lactams, including carbapenems, 
and aminoglycosides (ECDC 2012). Metallo-β-lactamases are the most common carbapenemases

identified in P. aeruginosa, however, the Ambler class A β-lactamase KPC has also been reported 
(Cuzon et al 2011).

Sterilisation of ceftazidime pentahydrate is described. Sterile ceftazidime pentahydrate is further 
processed aseptically with sodium carbonate to yield to a sterile ceftazidime carbonate blend. Details 
have been provided on process validation. 
The active substance is packaged in a sterilised Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE) inner bag. This 
provides a sterile barrier and contains a nitrogen headspace. The first bag is in an outer sterilised 
laminate bag of aluminium coupled with LDPE, nylon and polyester. This provides a gas, moisture and 
light barrier, which maintains a nitrogen headspace. The two sealed bags are then enclosed in a third, 
outer bag which is used for general handling protection only. The LDPE inner product contact bag 
conforms to the requirements of Ph. Eur. 3.1.4 “Polyethylene without additives for containers for 
preparations for parenteral use and for ophthalmic preparations”.  
Specification 
The specifications for sterile ceftazidime pentahydrate comply with the specifications and test methods 
of the Ph. Eur. monograph. Additional specifications have been set in compliance with the CEP for 
aqueous degradation products (HPLC) and residual solvents (GC).  Additional specifications have been 
also for set for bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.) and sterility (Ph. Eur.).  
Non-compendial methods have been adequately validated and described according to ICH Q2.  
The relevant information for reference standards has been assessed by the EDQM before issuing the 
Certificate of Suitability. 
Batch analysis data on three batches of the active substance are provided. The results are within the 
specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
According to the CEP, a retest period of 18 months is applicable if the non-sterile ceftazidime 
pentahydrate is stored at a temperature between 2 °C and 8 °C in a LPDE bag under nitrogen in an 
aluminium laminated bag placed in a sealed sterilised aluminium laminated bag. 
Sterile ceftazidime pentahydrate is not isolated during the manufacturing process. No hold time nor 
retest period is applied to sterile ceftazidime pentahydrate which is immediately blended in-line to 
make the finished product intermediate, sterile ceftazidime carbonate blend. 
Avibactam sodium 
General information 
Avibactam sodium is a new active substance. The chemical name of avibactam sodium is 
sodium[(2S,5R)-2-carbamoyl-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-6-yl]sulfate corresponding to the 
molecular formula C7H10N3O6SNa. It has a relative molecular mass of 287.23 g/mol and the following 
structure: 
Assessment report

The active substance is a white to pale yellow anhydrous hygroscopic crystalline powder, freely soluble 
in water. 
The active substance exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of three chiral centres (at the 1, 
the 2- and 5-positions). Stereoisomeric purity at C2 and C5 is controlled in the specification of the 
starting material. The stereochemistry at the bridgehead nitrogen (the 1-position) is dictated by the 
stereochemistry at the 5-position bridgehead carbon. The specification for avibactam sodium contains 
a limit for the enantiomer. 
Polymorphism has been observed for the active substance. Several polymorphic forms have been 
identified. The active substance can also be amorphous.  The manufacturing process consistently 
produces the same polymorphic form. Polymorphism is controlled by the manufacturing process of the 
active substance. Pivotal stability studies have shown that the polymorphic form produced does not 
convert to any other form under the proposed storage conditions. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is synthesized in four main steps using a well-defined starting material with 
acceptable specifications. Initially, a major objection was raised requesting re-definition of the starting 
material in order to ensure that critical steps of the manufacturing process were described in the 
dossier and carried out under GMP. In order to address these concerns, the applicant provided a 
detailed discussion of the origin, fate and purge of impurities upstream of the starting material, as well 
as a description of the synthetic process of the starting material including solvents, reagents and 
catalysts. It was demonstrated that impurities in the starting material are all efficiently purged and do 
not have the potential to impact the active substance quality. Control of stereoisomeric impurities has 
been demonstrated and there are no concerns in relation to elemental or mutagenic impurities.  
Rework of avibactam sodium may be performed. A detailed description of reworking steps has been 
provided and is considered acceptable. 
The active substance is sterilised using sterile filtration followed by sterile crystallisation. Process 
details and process validation data have been provided. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. Impurity tracking 
studies were carried out to understand the fate and purge of impurities present in the intermediates. It 
has been demonstrated that the impurity limits set in the intermediates’ specifications are sufficient to 
ensure they are purged to acceptable levels in isolated avibactam sodium.  
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the 
clinical development program. Changes introduced have been presented in sufficient detail and have 
been justified. A single polymorphic form has been produced in all late-stage development batches for 
clinical use, amorphous material having been used for the manufacture of finished product used in pre-
clinical, and phase I and II clinical studies. The manufacturing route in early development used the 
same intermediates and the same starting material. For the commercial manufacturing route, an 
additional isolation point was introduced, and the processing stages between two intermediates were 
redeveloped. These changes improved the operability and processing and also the quality of the 
avibactam sodium produced. 
Development of the control strategy for the manufacture of avibactam sodium has used a science and 
risk based approach 
Assessment report

Page 14/120 
 
 
 
 
 
• Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) for avibactam sodium were determined, following the principles 
defined in ICH Q11.  
• A risk-based approach was used to identify knowledge gaps and risks to the CQAs for avibactam 
sodium. Development work was then focused on the reduction of the identified risks.  
• Risk assessments in relation to scale-up have been performed for each of the manufacturing stages. 
There are no significant risks to the quality of avibactam with respect to scale up factors. 
Appropriate ranges have been set for the parameters within each process so that operation within the 
parameter ranges ensures the quality of the intermediate products, and avibactam sodium. 
Additionally, a control strategy has been developed summarising the critical processing and analytical 
steps, which ensures that all the CQAs for avibactam sodium are consistently met.  
A post-approval change management protocol (PACMP) to add a site for the manufacture and quality 
control of avibactam sodium was agreed. 
The chemical structure of the active substance has been confirmed by MS, NMR and FT-IR. In addition, 
solid state NMR and Gravimetric Vapour Sorption (GVS) analysis have been carried out. Single crystal 
X-Ray diffraction (SXRD) has been used to determine the crystal structure of the active substance and 
confirm the absolute configuration around the chiral carbon atoms. The characterisation of the active 
substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on chemistry of new active 
substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and 
characterised. A thorough assessment of the active substance manufacturing route has been 
performed in accordance with ICH M7. Three impurities were found to be mutagenic. Studies showed 
that these impurities were fully purged.  
The  active  substance  is  packaged  in  a  sterilised  LDPE  inner  bag.  This  provides  a  sterile  barrier  and 
contains  a  nitrogen  headspace.  The  first  bag  is  in  an  outer  sterilised  laminate  bag  of  aluminium 
coupled  with  LDPE,  nylon  and  polyester.  This  provides  a  gas,  moisture  and  light  barrier,  which 
maintains a nitrogen headspace. The two sealed bags are then enclosed in a third, outer bag which is 
used  for  general  handling  protection  only.  The  LDPE  inner  product  contact  bag  conforms  to  the 
requirements  of  Ph.  Eur.  3.1.4  “Polyethylene  without  additives  for  containers  for  preparations  for 
parenteral use and for ophthalmic preparations”.  
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identity (IR, HPLC), assay (HPLC), 
impurities (HPLC), enantiomeric impurity (chiral HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content (KF), 
sodium (flame photometry), sterility (Ph. Eur.) and bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.). 
Impurities present at higher content than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were 
qualified by toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data for ten production scale batches of the active substance manufactured using the 
proposed commercial manufacturing route were provided. The results were within the specifications 
and consistent from batch to batch. Supportive batch analysis data was provided for batches 
manufactured with previous manufacturing routes used during development.

Stability 
Stability data was provided for three production scale batches of active substance from the proposed 
manufacturer stored in the intended commercial package for 36 months under long term conditions at 
5 ºC and 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH 
according to the ICH guidelines.  
Batches were tested for assay, organic impurities (including enantiomer), water content, sterility, 
bacterial endotoxins and polymorphic identity. The analytical methods are the same as described for 
release. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. 
Based on the stability data available, no significant change was observed and all tested parameters 
were within the specifications. Avibactam sodium is not photosensitive. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 36 months when stored at 
25°C or below in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is a sterile, pyrogen-free, and white to pale yellow powder in 20 mL sterile 
pyrogen free vials.  
The excipient used is a well-known pharmaceutical ingredient and its quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
Ceftazidime has poor oral bioavailability and pre-clinical investigations showed that neither ceftazidime 
nor avibactam could achieve efficacious plasma concentrations when dosed via the oral route, so 
parenteral administration was required. Both components are highly soluble in water but long-term 
stability was not sufficient to allow development of an aqueous solution. Therefore, a solid dosage form 
for reconstitution prior to administration was sought.  A powder formulation made by co-lyophilising 
both active substances was also found to be unstable. 
For phase 1 and 2 clinical studies, avibactam and ceftazidime (FORTAZ/FORTUM)  were supplied in 
separate vials for reconstitution and co-administration as a single infusion solution.  
A formulation containing 2000 mg of ceftazidime and 500 mg of avibactam was selected for the phase 
3 and commercial formulation. In order to assure the accuracy and efficiency of the reconstitution 
stage, to reduce the complexity of the infusion preparation and to decrease the potential for dosing or 
administration errors, a combination product containing avibactam sodium and ceftazidime carbonate 
blend was developed. 
The bioavailability of the finished product prepared by using separate vials for co-administration, as a 
single infusion is considered to be equivalent to that of an infusion produced from a single vial 
containing all the components taking into account that for both phase 1/2 formulation and phase 
3/commercial formulation, the finished product is presented as an aqueous solution at the point of 
administration.

Manufacturing process development used science and risk based approaches, following the principles 
of ICH Q8 ‘Pharmaceutical Development’ and Q9 ‘Quality Risk Management’.  
A number of finished product characteristics were determined to ensure that the commercial 
formulation would meet the requirements stated in the quality target product profile (QTPP) defined 
as: an acceptable reconstitution time  in suitable IV diluents, an adequate tonicity of the infusion 
solution, a minimum shelf-life at launch of at least 2 years at controlled room temperature, an 
acceptable in-use profile consistent with intended use and typical pharmacy handling, compliance of 
the finished product with EP requirements for uniformity of dosage unit and stability.  
Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) were defined as those aspects affecting product purity, strength, 
active substance release and stability.  
Terminal sterilisation by either thermal treatment or irradiation was not a viable option for this product 
due to the level of degradation that occurred using either method. Development options for the 
required combination product were limited to commercially scalable aseptic processes. 
The product is manufactured through filling of both sterile ceftazidime carbonate blend and avibactam 
sodium.  This method was used to manufacture finished product from avibactam sodium and the 
ceftazidime carbonate blend for phase 3 clinical studies and is the proposed commercial manufacturing 
process. 
Headspace gas was investigated. Results of stability studies confirmed that the headspace gas 
composition selected was appropriate for the finished product.  
An overfill is used in order to ensure that the entire contents of the reconstituted vial can be accurately 
removed. This has been justified. 
A risk-based approach was used to identify knowledge gaps and risk to the CQAs. Failure Mode, Effects 
and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) was the main tool used for risk assessment throughout the 
development process. Each potential failure mode was scored in terms of probability, severity and 
detectability. The main process stages identified to potentially impact on CQAs are the vial filling and 
stoppering stages.  
The potential failure modes were investigated in development studies involving nine batches, covering 
a range of batch sizes, different batches of ceftazidime carbonate blend and avibactam sodium and 
involving changes in equipment configuration. These batches were utilised for clinical and stability 
studies. 
Knowledge obtained during the pharmaceutical development has been used to define an overall 
finished product control strategy. 
The control strategy includes input material controls, process parameter controls, in-process controls 
and finished product testing in order to ensure delivery of the required product quality attributes. 
The primary packaging is a 20 mL glass vial (Type 1) closed with a rubber (halobutyl) stopper and 
aluminium seal with flip-off cap. The material complies with Ph. Eur. requirements. The choice of the 
container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of 
the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of six main steps: mixing of sterile sodium carbonate (anhydrous) 
with sterile ceftazidime, aseptic vial filling with sterile ceftazidime carbonate blend and sterile 
Assessment report

avibactam sodium, gas overlay in the vial headspace, stoppering, crimping, bulk packaging. The 
process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process taking into account the experience of the 
manufacturer. 
The sterile ceftazidime carbonate blend is considered to be a finished product intermediate and its 
specifications include appropriate tests: appearance, identity (HPLC), appearance of aqueous solution, 
pH (Ph. Eur.), sodium carbonate content (flame photometry), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), 
pyridine content (HPLC), loss on drying (Ph. Eur.), sterility (Ph. Eur.) and bacterial endotoxins (Ph. 
Eur.). 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing 
process and pharmaceutical form.  
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: 
description, description on reconstitution, reconstitution time, pH (Ph. Eur.), identification (HLPC, UV), 
ceftazidime and avibactam assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), pyridine content (HPLC), 
uniformity of dosage unit (Ph. Eur.), particulate matter (Ph. Eur.), water content (Ph. Eur.), sterility 
(Ph. Eur.) and bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for nine pilot scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data was provided for three pilot scale batches of finished product stored in both the upright 
and inverted orientation under long term conditions for 24 months at  25 ºC / 60% RH and 30 ºC / 
75% RH and for 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH 
guidelines. The batches of medicinal product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were 
packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
An additional batch of finished product was placed on stability to support clinical studies. This batch 
has been manufactured using a non-sterile process. The purpose of this stability study was to generate 
supporting data at a stressed condition of 50°C for 1 month. 
The tests performed at each time point are appearance, description on reconstitution, reconstitution 
time, pH, assay of ceftazidime and avibactam, ceftazidime and avibactam degradation products, 
pyridine content and sub-visible particulate matter. Water content, sterility and bacterial endotoxins 
were performed at initial, annual and final time points only. 
After 2 years at 25°C/60% RH and 30°C/75% RH, small increases in pyridine content and unspecified 
ceftazidime impurities content were observed. All tests gave results below the specification limit. For 
ceftazidime assay, a decrease was observed but results comply with specifications. 
Assessment report

After 6 months at 40 °C/75% RH, an increase in pyridine content was observed. A small increase in 
unspecified ceftazidime impurities content was also noted. The levels of these impurities did not exceed 
the specification limit.   
Based on available stability data, all results comply with specifications. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. Results demonstrated that the finished product is light sensitive. 
Compatibility of finished product with infusion solutions was investigated. The data demonstrated the 
compatibility of the finished product with all combinations of dextrose and sodium chloride containing 
up to 5% dextrose and up to 0.9% sodium chloride and with lactated Ringer’s solution when stored for 
24 hours at 2°C to 8°C, followed by 12 hours at room temperature. 
Stability data were also provided on: 
• 
Three batches of bulk sterile ceftazidime carbonate blend finished product intermediate stored 
at 2°C to 8°C under a nitrogen headspace in sterile LDPE container closure system for 24 
months after blending. 
•  One batch of finished product manufactured using a 20 month old batch of ceftazidime 
carbonate blend.  
Based on available stability data, the holding time for finished product intermediate was considered 
acceptable. The proposed start of shelf life for the finished product, defined as the point of vial filling 
when the two active substances are filled into the vial, was considered acceptable. 
The proposed shelf-life of 36 months when stored in the original package in order to protect from light 
as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. For the synthesis of avibactam sodium, the choice of the 
starting material was justified by providing further information on its route of synthesis and a detailed 
discussion of the fate and purge of impurities. The applicant has applied QbD principles in the 
development of avibactam sodium and in the development of the finished product and their 
manufacturing processes. However, design spaces were not claimed for either.The results of tests 
carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these 
in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in 
clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development   
None.  
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Ceftazidime is a known active substance and CHMP agreed that the available non-clinical data on 
ceftazidime are acceptable and that no new data need to be generated.  
A comprehensive nonclinical testing program for the new active substance avibactam has been 
conducted.  
Safety margins are calculated based on total plasma levels in healthy volunteers given 500 mg 
avibactam and 2000 mg ceftazidime every 8 hours, 120 minute infusion (study ID D4280C00011). 
Clinical AUC(0-tau) values have been multiplied by three for comparison to AUC(0-24h) values in 
toxicology studies. All pivotal studies with avibactam alone and in combination with ceftazidime were 
conducted in accordance with GLP standards. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
A series of in vitro and in vivo studies were conducted to determine the activity of avibactam, alone 
and in combination with ceftazidime. These studies characterised the primary pharmacological 
mechanism of action, potential for resistance, mechanisms of resistance, bactericidal activity, and 
potential for synergy as well as spectrum of antibacterial activity. More than 10,500 contemporary 
isolates collected from hospitalised patients across 15 European Union countries in 2012 were tested 
for ceftazidime-avibactam susceptibility. 
Ceftazidime-avibactam is active against ceftazidime-resistant, and many carbapenem-resistant clinical 
isolates of Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa. It also has in vitro antibacterial activity against 
Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90 = 0.06 mg/L), and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90 = 0.012 mg/L), 
whereas Acinetobacter spp. are generally not susceptible.  In susceptible Gram-positive bacteria, the 
activity of ceftazidime-avibactam is similar to that of ceftazidime alone e.g. Streptococcus pyogenes 
(MIC90 = 0.25 mg/L), Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC90 = 1 mg/L) and penicillin-susceptible 
Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90 = 8 mg/L). The MIC90 of ceftazidime-avibactam against methicillin-
susceptible Staphylococcus aureus ranged from 8 to 16 mg/L.  In penicillin-non-susceptible S. 
pneumoniae or methicillin-resistant S. aureus, which use alterations to essential penicillin binding 
proteins (PBPs) rather than enzymatic degradation of β-lactams to mediate resistance to ceftazidime, 
avibactam does not restore the activity of ceftazidime. Similarly, β-lactam-resistant Enterococcus 
faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Listeria spp. are also resistant to both ceftazidime and ceftazidime-
avibactam. 
In time-kill studies against ceftazidime-resistant strains, ceftazidime-avibactam was generally 
bactericidal for the first 6 h, however by 24 h, various levels of re-growth had occurred. The same 
regimen, however, was shown to provide killing activity over 24 h in neutropenic mouse thigh and lung 
infection models against contemporary β-lactamase producing P. aeruginosa.  Furthermore, the 
efficacy of ceftazidime-avibactam, dosed at 2000 mg ceftazidime + 500 mg avibactam as a 120-
minute IV infusion, q8h, was demonstrated in a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial (RECLAIM). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/377887/2016  
Page 20/120 
 
 
 
 
 
The animal models and PK/PD show that avibactam does not adversely affect the antibacterial activity 
of ceftazidime against Gram-negative or Gram-positive bacteria in vivo.  Moreover, the data suggests 
that avibactam restores the activity of ceftazidime in vivo and the animal efficacy studies also indicate 
that ceftazidime- avibactam penetrates into the site of infection in the murine peritoneal cavity, 
kidney, thigh, and lung, and the cerebrospinal fluid in a rabbit meningitis model. 
The in vivo study assessing the efficacy of ceftazidime-avibactam in a model of pyelonephritis in the 
neutropenic mouse was conducted prior to the current reference method of testing the susceptibility to 
ceftazidime-avibactam was established. Ceftazidime and avibactam were co-diluted in the fixed 4:1 
ratio, whereas the reference method now established is to dilute ceftazidime while maintaining the 
concentration of avibactam fixed at 4 mg/L.  However, suitable efficacy was demonstrated on this 
study and given the extent of clinical data available with ceftazidime-avibactam this was deemed 
acceptable by CHMP, which considered that this has no relevance for clinical safety. 
In the in vivo study assessing the efficacy of ceftazidime-avibactam in a rabbit model of meningitis, the 
Applicant claimed that the ceftazidime exposure in the CSF represented about 43% of plasma AUC and 
that the penetration of avibactam exposure in CSF resulted in approximately 38% of the plasma AUC.  
This claim could not be verified, as the AUC data were not been provided in the final study report.  The 
exposure and subsequent efficacy, however, could be confirmed by mean ceftazidime and avibactam 
concentration data in both plasma and CSF and from subsequent decreases in bacterial counts in 
cerebrospinal fluid. 
CHMP agreed that from a non-clinical perspective the in vitro and in vivo primary pharmacology data 
suitably support this MA application. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No significant activity (defined as >50% inhibition) was detected in receptor/enzyme screens of 
avibactam at a single concentration of 100 μg/mL.  At 1000 μM, avibactam also had no significant 
inhibitory activity against several mammalian serine proteases during an assessment to determine if 
there was any avibactam inhibition that might be analogous to its β-lactamase inhibition mechanism. 
Finally, avibactam had no significant activity at plasmin or thrombin proteases while an IC50 of 1.49 
mM was defined for chymotrypsin. This suggests little potential for inducing off-target activity in 
humans at the clinical dose [human mean free Cmax = 13 μg/mL (49 μM)]. No tests have been 
conducted with ceftazidime, which is considered acceptable.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
A full package of safety pharmacology was completed for avibactam alone, which is in accordance with 
the CHMP guideline CPMP/ICH/539/00 (ICH Topic S7A). Since avibactam was shown not to adversely 
affect the antibacterial activity of ceftazidime and there are no safety concerns for avibactam, it was 
agreed by CHMP that combination safety pharmacology studies with ceftazidime-avibactam are not 
required. 
In a rat CNS study in which animals were given 30-minute IV doses of up to 1000 mg/kg, reduced 
muscle tone, slight miosis, and decreased reactivity to touch were observed in some avibactam-treated 
animals, together with gastrointestinal changes (defecation/diarrhoea) at 1000 mg/kg. The Applicant 
argues that the reduced muscle tone, slight miosis, and decreased reactivity to touch were not 
considered to be test-article related as the incidence was low. Whilst it is agreed that there was a low 
incidence of animals affected, decreased muscle tone was observed at all doses and reactivity to touch 
was observed at the mid and high doses (300 and 1000 mg/kg, respectively).  No safety concerns for 
vital signs have been noted in clinical studies.  GI effects have been reported clinically. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/377887/2016

At up to 300 μM, avibactam was found to weakly block the hERG channel (3.9 ± 2.5%, 15.5 ± 4.6%, 
and 20.7 ± 6.4%, at 30, 100, and 300 μM, respectively), but an IC50 value could not be defined. 
There were, however, no effects in the hERG assay tested in transfected human embryonic kidney 
(HEK293) cells at concentrations of up to 1000 μM in a subsequent GLP study. There were no new 
safety concerns identified from clinical ECG, hERG and thorough QT studies and therefore CHMP agreed 
that the effects seen in the initial non-GLP safety pharmacology study are unlikely to translate into 
patients.  
Intravenous administration of avibactam did not produce any adverse effects on arterial blood 
pressure, heart rate or the ECG intervals, rhythm or waveform morphology in the dog at doses up to 
1000 mg/kg (Cmax = 3474 μg/mL; AUC(0 t) = 3646 μg.h/mL).  Likewise, at up to 1000 mg/kg in the 
rat, there were also no effects on respiratory rate, tidal volume, or minute volume (Cmax = 1234 
μg/mL; AUC(0-t) = 788 μg.h/mL) or on urinary volume, urinary pH and potassium and creatinine 
excretion. There was, however, a dose-dependent increase in sodium excretion that was statistically 
significant at the nominal dose of 1000 mg/kg. As there were no significant increases in urinary sodium 
reported clinically, CHMP agreed that this finding is unlikely to pose a clinical risk. The Cmax values are 
approximately 248- and 88-fold (dog and rat, respectively) greater than the exposure data from 
healthy subjects receiving 500mg avibactam/2000mg ceftazidime on clinical study D4280C00011 Part 
B, Treatment C (Day 4). 
Avibactam induced a statistically significant delay in mean intestinal transit at 2000 mg/kg via the oral 
route in the rat (54.5% versus 71.9% in control group). The Cmax and corresponding AUC(0-t) values 
were as follows: Cmax: 83.3 µg/mL; AUC(0-t): 114 µg/mL.h. The Cmax value is approximately 6-fold 
higher than the exposure data from healthy subjects receiving 500mg avibactam/2000mg ceftazidime 
on clinical study D4280C00011 Part B, Treatment C (Day 4). CHMP agreed that this had low relevance 
for the clinical situation where avibactam, in combination with ceftazidime, led to incidences of GI 
disorders, of which nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea were the most common adverse events recorded. 
These findings were expected, as they are also documented on the ceftazidime PI. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
The effect of combining ceftazidime-avibactam with other antimicrobial agents that might be co-
administered to an infected patient was assessed using the checkerboard method and determining the 
fractional inhibitory concentrations (FICs) and FIC indices (FICIs). The extent of interaction was 
determined between ceftazidime or ceftazidime-avibactam and colistin, levofloxacin, linezolid, 
tigecycline, tobramycin and vancomycin. Twenty-seven isolates were tested, including 3 E. cloacae, 5 
E. coli, 7 K. pneumoniae, 6 P. aeruginosa, 3 S. aureus and 3 E. faecalis. No antibacterial antagonism 
was observed between ceftazidime-avibactam and antibacterial agents of other drug classes. 
In another study, avibactam was also investigated for interactions or antagonistic effects of ceftazidime 
against penicillinase positive and negative strains of MSSA. Again, there was no antagonistic effect of 
avibactam inhibiting ceftazidime against either penicillinase positive or negative strains of MSSA. 
To rule out the potential for interaction between ceftazidime or ceftazidime-avibactam with 
metronidazole during co-dosing in the intraabdominal clinical trials, studies were performed against 
target Enterobacteriaceae species grown under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Metronidazole 
lacked any activity against several strains of E. coli and K. pneumoniae under anaerobic conditions.  
Using the checkerboard method, interactions between ceftazidime-avibactam and metronidazole were 
investigated under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions against isolates of E. coli and K. pneumoniae 
expressing a variety of β-lactamases. No interactions were observed between ceftazidime or 
ceftazidime-avibactam and metronidazole for any of the isolates tested.  It could therefore be 
concluded that metronidazole is likely to have no effect on the activity of ceftazidime-avibactam 
Assessment report

against Enterobacteriaceae growing under aerobic or anaerobic conditions and that any efficacy 
observed in studies of intra-abdominal infections caused by these target pathogens is due to the 
activity of ceftazidime-avibactam alone. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Ceftazidime 
In humans, ceftazidime has a half-life of approximately 1.9 hours following iv administration. In rat 
and dog, the half-life is reported to be 21 and 49 minutes, respectively. In rat and rabbit, the 
distribution of ceftazidime after iv or im administration was highest in kidney and liver. Distribution to 
the respiratory tract and brain occurs to a limited extent, similar to findings in studies conducted with 
avibactam in combination with ceftazidime. No data on placental or milk transfer for ceftazidime have 
been presented by the applicant. Cephalosporins, including ceftazidime, are however known to cross 
the placenta in humans, but there is no evidence of teratogenic or embryotoxic effects available from 
animals or humans to date.  Cephalosporins are generally considered safe during pregnancy. Similar to 
avibactam, ceftazidime is also excreted in human milk, but in low quantities not expected to have any 
adverse effect on breastfed infants. Similar to avibactam, Ceftazidime binds poorly to human plasma 
protein, is not metabolised, and is excreted renally. 
Avibactam, and avibactam in combination with ceftazidime 
Slightly decreased exposures to avibactam were observed in the dog following 13 weeks of repeat IV 
dosing when compared to 4 weeks of dosing via the same route.  Given the extensive clinical exposure 
data available and the fact that avibactam showed no significant inhibition of cytochrome P450 
enzymes or UGT1A1 and no CYP induction potential within the clinically relevant exposure range, no 
further non-clinical investigations are required. 
Avibactam demonstrated approximately ≤ 22.1% binding to animal plasma proteins (mouse, rat, 
rabbit and dog) and ranged from 5.7% to 8.2% in human plasma proteins. The use of anticoagulants 
with avibactam had no effect on plasma protein binding as avibactam was <20% bound across 
different species. The ratio of ex vivo blood/plasma partitioning of unchanged avibactam was 0.69 in 
the rat and 0.64 to 0.71 in the dog. The in vitro human white blood cell partitioning coefficient of 
avibactam was <10%, suggesting that avibactam has low penetration into blood cells. 
Placental transfer of avibactam was evident in both the rat and rabbit, with elimination being faster 
from maternal circulation than from systemic tissues, including the foetus. Avibactam exposure in rat 
milk appeared approximately dose-proportional and avibactam concentrations were lower in milk than 
in plasma 0.5 h after the end of infusion. Very low levels of avibactam (3000-6000 fold lower than in 
maternal plasma) were detected in weaning pups. The lack of data on avibactam excretion in human 
milk has been adequately addressed in the Zavicefta SmPC (section 4.6). 
In the single IV dose tissue distribution studies, the terminal half-life of radioactivity in rat plasma was 
estimated at approximately 42 hours. The radioactive half-life in most of the organs analysed was 
similar to that observed in plasma, except for non-pigmented skin (72 hours) and fat (76 hours). 
Avibactam was rapidly excreted in urine in all non-clinical species via glomerular filtration, accounting 
for approximately 82% of the infused dose.  Faecal excretion accounted for approximately 17%, 4.6% 
and 0.6% of the dose in the rat, dog and rabbit, respectively. Biliary excretion in vivo was not 
evaluated as the major route of elimination of avibactam is via urine. 
Avibactam (but not ceftazidime) is also eliminated by transport (via OAT1 and OAT3) across the renal 
epithelium; therefore drugs that induce or inhibit the OAT1 and/or OAT3 transporters may affect 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/377887/2016  
Page 23/120 
 
 
 
 
 
avibactam blood concentrations. Section 4.5 of the Zavicefta SmPC advises that CAZ-AVI should not be 
co-administered with probenecid or other drugs which induce or inhibit OAT1 and/or OAT3.  
In studies assessing the transporter inhibition and substrate potential of avibactam, inhibition of OAT1 
and OAT3 by avibactam occurred only at exposures in excess of those seen clinically and therefore this 
is unlikely to have clinical relevance.   
Avibactam did not have any inhibitory properties or time dependent inhibition of human CYP activities 
(CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4/5) at concentrations up to 200 μM. There was no 
time-dependent inhibition of CYP2C9 activity, but inhibition (29%) was recorded at the highest 
concentration of 200 μM, which is approximately 4-fold higher than human free Cmax (49 μM). An 
additional study conducted at concentrations ranging from 1.0 to 5000 μM indicated that avibactam did 
not inhibit CYP2C9 activity at concentrations below 5000 μM (1326 μg/mL), which is approximately 
>100-fold the Cmax at the intended human dose. These data suggest that avibactam has minimal 
potential for P450-dependent drug-drug interactions in humans at clinically relevant concentrations. 
CHMP noted that the applicant did not discuss the transporter inhibitor constant (Ki) values in terms of 
the unbound free fraction. However, a study assessing the ability of avibactam to inhibit CYP2C9 in 
human liver microsomes showed that avibactam had an inhibition rate of 36% at 5 mM (highest 
concentration tested), with an estimated Ki value as 11 mM (based on the inhibition at the highest 
concentration only). Since avibactam has been shown not to have any inhibition potential within the 
clinically relevant exposure range, CHMP agreed that no further studies are required. 
No PK drug-drug interactions were observed between avibactam and ceftazidime following single or 
repeat IV administration to rats and dogs for up to 28 days.  Ceftazidime did not interact with the 
active uptake of avibactam into the proximal tubular cells in the kidney in an in vitro HEK cell model. 
A known degradation product (metabolite M1), was detected in the formulation used to metabolically 
profile rat and dog excreta (study no. A051246). Avibactam decarbonyl (M1) has been toxicologically 
qualified up to a minimum of 0.7% in the 28 day intravenous study in the beagle dog and at 0.67% in 
the 13 week rat study, which exceeds the toxicological qualification threshold of 0.2%. The final drug 
product specification for M1 has a limit of NMT 0.5%, which is within the limit of toxicological 
qualification. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The nonclinical safety evaluation program for avibactam included toxicity studies of up to 3 months 
duration in rats and dogs, genetic toxicology, reproductive toxicology (male and female fertility in rats, 
embryo-foetal development in the rat and rabbit, and pre-and post-natal development in the rat), 
immunotoxicology, local tolerance studies and an in vitro phototoxicity study. 
Ceftazidime is a marketed antibiotic with an established nonclinical and clinical safety profile that is as 
expected for a β-lactam agent. A summary of the nonclinical studies performed on ceftazidime by the 
Sponsors for the original marketing application is reported in the literature (Capel-Edwards et al, 
Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (1981)). Based on the knowledge of the ceftazidime safety 
profile and the absence of any nonclinical safety concerns for avibactam, combination genetic 
toxicology and reproductive toxicology studies have not been conducted. However, in accordance with 
ICH M3(R2), general toxicity studies using the combination at the intended clinical ratio have been 
conducted. Further, a juvenile toxicity study has also been conducted with the combination.

Single dose toxicity 
Treatment with avibactam at 2000 mg/kg following a single 30 minute infusion via the tail vein in the 
mouse and rat was associated with haematomas and/or crusts on the tail. No deaths occurred with 
either species.  In the mouse, no other associated test article-related effects were observed. In the rat, 
reduced body weight gain was observed in males during the first week of the study. The minimum 
lethal IV dose of avibactam was therefore deemed to be >2000 mg/kg in both the mouse and rat. No 
single-dose toxicity studies were conducted with avibactam in combination with ceftazidime. This is 
considered acceptable by CHMP, in view of the findings with avibactam, and the known safety profile of 
ceftazidime. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeat-dose rat and dog toxicity studies have been conducted with avibactam, and with avibactam in 
combination with ceftazidime. No additional studies were conducted with ceftazidime alone, and this 
was considered acceptable by CHMP. 
Repeat dose toxicology studies were conducted in rats and dogs of up to 4 and 13 weeks in duration 
via the IV route of administration with avibactam. In addition, studies of up to 4 weeks duration were 
conducted in the same species with avibactam and ceftazidime alone or in combination with one 
another in a 4:1 ratio (ceftazidime:avibactam).  Doses of up to 1200 mg/kg/day avibactam and 2000 
mg/kg/day ceftazidime were given to animals. In the combination studies doses of 0/0, 0/500, 2000/0, 
666/167 and 2000/500 mg/kg/day CAZ-AVI were given to rats and doses of 0/0, 1000/0, 500/125 and 
1000/250 mg/kg/day CAZ-AVI were given to the dogs. 
In the pivotal 4-week GLP studies with avibactam (167, 500, 1000 or 1200 mg/kg/day), male rats 
treated with 1200 mg/kg/day were euthanized early due to local tolerance issues at the injection site. 
Three premature deaths also occurred (1 at each lower dose level) that were attributed to stress in the 
restraining tube. The main finding was lesions on the tail (injection sites), including haematoma, 
dryness, wounds, shortened tail, blackish colour and scabs, predominantly at ≥1000 mg/kg/day with 
some recovery. This correlated with the test article-related microscopic observations in and around the 
injection sites at all doses. Decreased body weight gain was seen in males at 1200 mg/kg/day and in 
females at 1000 mg/kg/day, with no corresponding food consumption effects. Slight increases in 
fibrinogen in males at 1200 mg/kg/day and decreased inorganic phosphorus in both sexes at 1000 
mg/kg/day were deemed to be of limited toxicological importance. The NOEL was 167 mg/kg/day 
(based on injection site effects). 
In the 4-week dog study, there were no major test article-related toxicological findings at 250, 500 or 
1000 mg/kg/day avibactam. Sporadic emesis was noted in 2 animals of each sex at 1000 mg/kg/day 
and in 1 female at 500 mg/kg/day, which was deemed to be of limited toxicological importance. At 
necropsy, lesions were noted at the injection sites, comprising haemorrhage, subacute inflammatory 
lesions, collagen degeneration and dermal/subcutis fibrosis in the vein and adjacent subcutis lesions. 
The incidence and severity of the lesions was slightly greater at 1000 mg/kg/day. The NOEL was 500 
mg/kg/day. 
The 13-week IV rat study with avibactam (65, 125 or 250 mg/kg/day) resulted in poor clinical 
condition of the animals, which led to early mortality in all groups, including controls. Abscesses were 
observed in one or more organs, including controls, which were attributed to the dosing procedure.  
One male animal at 65 mg/kg/day had a malignant lymphomatous infiltration in the liver, spleen, lung 
and sternal bone marrow. Nodules were recorded in the lung and pancreas in females at 125 
mg/kg/day. Reduced haemoglobin concentration and packed cell volume, with increases in fibrinogen 
were attributed to inflammatory processes. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/377887/2016  
Page 25/120 
 
 
 
 
 
Males at 250 mg/kg/day had increases in spleen weights with minimal myeloid hyperplasia, which was 
considered to be related to the presence of abscesses.  In animals with no abscesses, thrombus at the 
injection site, with or without chronic inflammation was observed.  The applicant deemed the NOAEL to 
be 250 mg/kg/day.  It is unclear as to the link between the development of malignant lymphomatous 
infiltration in the liver, spleen, lung and sternal bone marrow and the presence of abscesses in the 
male dosed at 65 mg/kg/day. Since this finding was only recorded in one animal with no dose response 
and was not seen in any other non-clinical species and the proposed clinical exposure is of short 
duration (<28 days), it is unlikely to translate into a clinical risk.  
In the 13-week IV dog study with avibactam (65, 125 or 250 mg/kg/day) no major test article-related 
effects were noted at any dose. Histological changes observed were mainly at the injection sites and 
showed a similar incidence and/or severity in controls and treated groups. A relationship to treatment, 
therefore, could not be established. The NOAEL was considered to be 250 mg/kg/day, which was 
agreed upon by CHMP. 
In the 4-week rat IV combination study poor tolerance at the injection sites at 2000 mg/kg/day CAZ 
and 2000/500 mg/kg/day CAZ-AVI led to early termination of these groups on day 15. Further 
mortality, as a result of poor local tolerance, also occurred in males at 500 mg/kg avibactam. 
Piloerection (2000/500 mg/kg/day CAZ-AVI), tail lesions (all treated groups), decreased body weight 
gain and food consumption (males treated with CAZ alone or 2000/500 mg/kg/day CAZ-AVI) and 
increased urine colour (CAZ alone or high-dose combination) were noted. Changes in haematological 
parameters and histopathological findings in all treated groups were associated with the poor local 
tolerance at the injection site. There was no evidence that avibactam was adding to the toxicity of 
ceftazidime, although the severity of the tolerability findings appeared to increase with the combination 
of ceftazidime and avibactam. 
The derivation of the NOEL was not agreed since the animals dosed at 2000/500 mg/kg/day CAZ-AVI 
did not complete the full 28 day study duration, which is needed to support this MAA. However, since 
there were no major findings in the clinical safety studies the data obtained over 14 days in the rat is 
accepted by CHMP. 
In 4-week IV combination study in the dog, emesis and excessive salivation (mainly in the females) 
were noted at 1000 mg/kg/day (CAZ only), 500/125 mg/kg/day (CAZ-AVI) and 1000/250 mg/kg/day 
(CAZ-AVI. Lower systolic and diastolic blood pressures (up to -35%) were seen in males at 1000 
mg/kg/day ceftazidime (alone or in combination), but at 500 mg/kg/day ceftazidime (in combination 
with avibactam at 125 mg/kg/day) there were no effects on systolic or diastolic blood pressure. There 
are currently no reports of blood pressure effects in the clinical studies with ceftazidime. Based on the 
combined ceftazidime AUC and Cmax for ceftazidime in both sexes at 500/125 mg/kg/day on day 28 
(1186 µg.h/mL and 1192 μg/mL, respectively) the margins of safety would be approximately 1.3 for 
AUC and 12 for Cmax based on exposure data from healthy subjects receiving 2/0.5 g CAZ-AVI. 
High cholesterol (all treated groups) and triglycerides was seen in all treated females and males at 
1000 mg/kg/day ceftazidime (alone or in combination). Urine volumes were higher in females given 
ceftazidime alone. Liver weights were higher at 1000 mg/kg/day ceftazidime (alone or in combination), 
which correlated with centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy. The applicant suggests that all these 
indicated an effect of ceftazidime. Low thymus weights in male dogs, mainly at 1000 mg/kg/day 
ceftazidime, were associated lymphoid depletion. Although a test article relationship cannot be 
excluded, this was most probably due to stress (as a result of the high incidence of emesis). 
Histopathological findings were recorded at the injection site only, which were related to the injection 
procedure and of no toxicological importance.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/377887/2016

Compared to the individual agents, no new effects or unexpected toxicities were observed when 
avibactam was administered in combination with ceftazidime via the IV route in a 1:4 ratio. The main 
finding in both species concerned tolerability at the injection sites, the severity of which appeared to 
increase with the combination of ceftazidime and avibactam in the rat, but not in the dog. 
In the combined (avibactam or ceftazidime) 4 week rat study using a combined AUC and Cmax for 
avibactam in both sexes at 666/167 mg/kg/day on day 13 (92.5 µg.h/mL and 146 μg/mL, 
respectively) the margins of safety would be approximately 10 for Cmax.  
Genotoxicity 
Three screening genotoxicity studies and four pivotal GLP genotoxicity studies were conducted with 
avibactam alone. Avibactam was negative for genotoxicity in a bacterial mutagenicity assay, in in vitro 
and in vivo micronucleus assays and in two in vitro rat liver UDS assays. In one mammalian 
chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes, avibactam induced a small, non-reproducible, 
significant increase in chromosome aberrations at cytotoxic concentrations. These initial findings were 
not evident in a second assay at concentrations up to 5000 μg/mL avibactam. Overall, based on these 
results, it can be considered that avibactam was negative in the Ames assay, unscheduled DNA 
synthesis, chromosomal aberration assay and rat micronucleus test.  
No genotoxicity studies have been conducted with ceftazidime or with ceftazidime/avibactam. This is 
considered acceptable by CHMP, based on the known safety profile ceftazidime (Capel-Edwards et al., 
1981), and the absence of any nonclinical safety concerns for avibactam. 
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies were conducted with avibactam alone or in combination with ceftazidime 
due to the intended duration of therapy (<28 days), which is in line ICH guideline S1A. CHMP 
considered therefore that the lack of carcinogenicity studies is acceptable. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
No additional reproduction toxicity studies have been conducted with ceftazidime. The established 
safety profile of ceftazidime does not indicate any toxic potential to reproduction (Capel-Edwards et al., 
1981).  
Avibactam did not affect female fertility/reproductive performance or embryofoetal development 
following repeat IV administration to rats at doses up to 250 mg/kg/day. Small decreases in 
epididymal and prostate weights at 1000 mg/kg/day in the male fertility study were considered to be a 
secondary effect to a decrease in bodyweight gain at all doses. 
In the rat embryofoetal development study, there were two malformed foetuses at 500 mg/kg/day 
(one with domed head, protruding tongue, malrotated right hind limb and hyperextension of the right 
forepaw and a second with scoliosis) and at 1000 mg/kg/day (anophthalmia).  Given that not all 
external, visceral, and skeletal malformations were noted in the background data and that exposure to 
avibactam at 500 mg/kg/day was higher than that at 1000 mg/kg/day, the applicant’s conclusion that 
the findings did not suggest an involvement of avibactam was questioned.  Since there were no 
malformations and no overall effects on embryo-foetal development at 250 mg/kg/day, the exposures 
at this dose were considered as an appropriate reference for a no observed effect level (NOEL) for 
embryofoetal changes in the rat. 
In the rabbit embryofoetal development study, there was an increased post-implantation loss at 1000 
mg/kg/day and lower mean foetal weights with slightly retarded ossification of the metacarpal of the 
first digit, tarsal bone and sixth sternebra was observed at 300 mg/kg/day and above. There were no 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/377887/2016  
Page 27/120 
 
 
 
 
 
other overt findings at 100 mg/kg/day and this dose is therefore deemed to be the NOEL for 
embryofoetal changes in the rabbit and the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for maternal 
toxicity. The margins of safety at these exposures would be approximately 2.4 for AUC0-t and 22 for 
Cmax based on exposure data from healthy subjects receiving 2 g/0.5 g CAZ-AVI. 
Avibactam administered alone during pregnancy and lactation to F0 rats was associated with a dose-
related increase in the incidence of renal pelvic dilatation and ureter dilatation, with no associated 
pathological changes to the renal parenchyma. There was no evidence of recovery in the renal pelvic 
dilatation but the ureteric dilations were not seen in the young adult offspring. These findings were 
considered to be associated with administration of avibactam. The dose of 120 mg/kg/day is 
considered to be the NOEL for the unilateral or bilateral renal pelvic dilatation and/or luminal dilatation 
of the ureters.   
The margins of safety at these exposures would be approximately 1.3 for AUC0-t and 11 for Cmax, 
based on exposure data from healthy subjects receiving 2 g/0.5 g CAZ-AVI. However, the possibility 
that these findings may be relevant for humans cannot be excluded, so the applicant has adequately 
addressed the findings in the kidneys and ureters from a reproductive toxicology perspective in 
sections 4.6 and 5.3 of the SmPC, which is acceptable. 
The SmPC adequately addresses use in pregnancy. This combination is intended to be used in the 
controlled environment of a hospital for not more than 14 days (i.e. short duration of dosing) so that 
the reproductive data are sufficient to support this application.  
No reproductive studies were conducted with ceftazidime in combination with avibactam based on the 
results observed with the individual compounds. This is considered acceptable by CHMP. 
Local Tolerance  
The applicant has assessed the local tolerance of avibactam, using data from the repeat dose 
toxicology studies and via a local tolerance study in the rabbit.  Avibactam tolerance was assessed 
both alone and in combination with ceftazidime. Following repeated dosing in rats, substantial local 
reactions to ceftazidime and/or avibactam via peripheral vein were dose related. The severity of these 
findings appeared to increase with the combination, but this was not observed in the dog. 
Other toxicity studies 
An immune cell phenotyping test of avibactam at 0, 250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg/day in Sprague Dawley 
rats showed no depletions in CD3, CD4, CD8, NK cells (CD3-/CD161+) or NK T cell (CD3+/CD161+) 
populations. Cytotoxicity and plaque forming cell (PFC) assays indicated that there was no depletion of 
immune function. For the specific CD45RA B-cell subpopulation, lower values were observed in males 
at 500 and 1000 mg/kg/day, but without a dose-relationship.  This result is considered equivocal with 
respect to biological relevance, since there were no associated depressions in B-cell function in the PFC 
assay. There were no histological changes in the lymphoid organs at any dose of avibactam. 
Avibactam was detected in 11 of 12 control animals in this study, with plasma concentrations in three 
animals at day 21 (4078, 2232 and 1046 ng/ml in animal 8, 18 and 20, respectively) in line with the 
avibactam-levels in the dosed groups at 4 hours post-dosing. Historical control data on T-cell subsets, 
demonstrated that CD3, CD4 and CD8 T-cells in control animals are within the historical control range, 
thereby suggesting that any potential contamination did not significantly affect the T cell subset levels. 
Results from a keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) assay, without contamination, indicated that T- and 
B-cell function is not impaired, which supports the lack of findings in the direct Plaque Forming Cell 
(PFC) assay in the immunotoxicity study. As a result, the immunotoxicity study is considered 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/377887/2016  
Page 28/120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
acceptable even though the source of contamination is not known. Avibactam therefore has no adverse 
effects on the immune function in rats at intravenous doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks.  
All impurities which require qualification according to ICH guidelines (ICH Q3B (R2)) have been 
adequately qualified in the toxicology studies.  The applicant has conducted a mutagenic assay for the 
potential impurity AZ1359137. Since AZ13591372 was negative in this assay, it is considered a non-
mutagenic impurity and should be treated as such by the applicant. 
Avibactam did not absorb in the UV wavelength (290 to 700 nm) and was negative in the in vitro 
Balb/c3T3 fibroblasts assay and is therefore considered not to have a photosafety concern. 
Avibactam showed no potential to haemolyse human red blood cells in vitro at concentrations up to 
and including 20 mg/mL (alone) or at 5 mg/mL when in combination with 20 mg/mL ceftazidime. 
Juvenile Toxicology 
Two investigative studies were conducted to assess the renal cysts in neonatal/juvenile rats. The 
evidence from these two studies, combined with the lack of renal cysts in the repeat dose toxicity 
studies in the same species/strain of rat, suggests that the findings in the juvenile toxicity study are 
background lesions from one specific breeding facility. CHMP considered that it was therefore unlikely 
that the renal cysts have any clinical significance since they appear to arise spontaneously in untreated 
rats. 
Ceftazidime/avibactam was dosed via an IV bolus injection into the tail vein of suckling rats once daily 
for 14 days from post-natal Day 7 to post-natal Day 20, using the intended clinical ratio of 4:1 
ceftazidime: avibactam. Renal cortical cysts in all groups, including controls, were observed at 
necropsy and by histology and were still present at the end of the 5 week recovery phase. The cysts 
covered a small proportion of the cortex and did not appear to have any significant implications for the 
animals (no adverse clinical signs, no effects on body weight gain and no significant changes in clinical 
pathology or organ weights). Evidence from two additional supportive studies and the lack of renal 
cysts in the repeat dose toxicity studies in the same species/strain of rat, suggests that the findings 
are background lesions from one specific breeding facility. A reversible increase in extramedullary 
haematopoiesis was observed in the spleen and liver of both sexes at 455/115 mg/kg/day CAZ-AVI. 
Although not discussed by the applicant, one female at 50/13 mg/kg/day on PND 21 and one female at 
455/115 mg/kg/day on PND 56 had unilateral pelvic dilatation in the kidney. These observations are 
consistent with findings from the pre- and postnatal development study, which were associated with 
administration of avibactam. The NOAEL is considered to be 455 /115 mg/kg/day CAZ-AVI. 
The applicant has provided an additional discussion on the clinical relevance of the renal cortical cysts 
findings in the rat juvenile study.  CHMP concluded that the cysts observed are substantially distinct 
from human polycystic renal disease where the numerous cysts disrupt the architecture of the kidney 
and affect renal function. In addition, nephrogenesis is still on-going in juvenile rats of the age used in 
the toxicology studies, whereas it is complete by 34 weeks gestation in humans, implying that the 
renal findings observed in the juvenile rats are unlikely to be relevant for humans. Furthermore, based 
on the nature and very low number of the renal cortical cysts, reflecting an effect on a minimal number 
of individual nephrons (i.e. each cyst indicating one single nephron), CHMP considered that should the 
finding occur in humans it would not have any clinical impact in paediatric patients, including pre-term 
neonates.  
The cysts in the rat juvenile toxicity study covered a small proportion of the cortex and did not appear 
to have any significant implications for the animals.  The observed cysts are known to be a common 
background finding in the developing kidney of Sprague-Dawley rats, are not seen in young adult

animals and appeared to produce only a little or no morphological change.  CHMP agreed therefore that 
the cortical cysts have little relevance for humans, and would have no clinical impact should they arise.

Avibactam unlikely 
to represent a risk 
to terrestrial or 
sediment dwelling 
organisms. 
CHMP agreed that the environmental toxicity profiles were established for avibactam and ceftazidime, 
in accordance with the ERA guideline. It was noted that the study on ceftazidime transformation in 
water/sediment systems (OECD 308) showed that both main transformation products M1 and M3 are 
very persistent as the DT50 values in the low organic content (LOC) system are higher than 60 days.  
As a result, Zavicefta should be considered as very persistent. The revised PEC/PNEC ratios indicate 
that avibactam and ceftazidime are unlikely to present a risk to sediment dwelling organisms.  
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Ceftazidime is a known active substance and CHMP agreed that no new non-clinical data need to be 
generated for ceftazidime. A comprehensive nonclinical testing program for the new active substance 
avibactam has been conducted by the Applicant. Animal models and PK/PD demonstrate that 
avibactam does not adversely affect the antibacterial activity of ceftazidime and restores the activity of 
ceftazidime against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria within its spectrum of activity and within the 
range of inhibition of avibactam. In a non-GLP study, avibactam was found to weakly block the hERG 
channel at up to 300 μM, with no IC50 value defined. There were no signals observed in a subsequent 
GLP study at up to 1000 μM and no safety concerns were identified in clinical studies, so the effect 
seen in the non-GLP safety pharmacology study is unlikely to transfer into patients. Intravenous 
administration of avibactam had no clinically relevant effects on the cardiovascular, respiratory, 
gastrointestinal or renal systems.  Slightly decreased exposures to avibactam were observed in the 13 
week intravenous dosing dog study when compared to 4 weeks of dosing, but since avibactam showed 
no inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes or UGT1A1 and no CYP induction potential within the 
clinically relevant exposure range, no further investigations are required. Avibactam had no effect on 
plasma protein binding and has low penetration into blood cells. Evidence showed that avibactam 
crosses the placenta and is also excreted in rat milk.  The lack of data on avibactam excretion in 
human milk is addressed in the Zavicefta SmPC. 
Avibactam is readily excreted in urine and is also eliminated by OAT1 and OAT3 transport across the 
renal epithelium (but not ceftazidime). Blood concentrations of avibactam may therefore be affected by 
other drugs which induce or inhibit OAT1 and/or OAT3 transportation. No PK drug-drug interactions 
were observed between avibactam and ceftazidime following single or repeat IV administration to rats 
and dogs for up to 28 days and ceftazidime does not interact with the active uptake of avibactam into 
the proximal tubular cells in the kidney. 
The minimum lethal single IV dose of avibactam is >2000 mg/kg in both the mouse and rat. Following 
daily intravenous administration of avibactam for 4-weeks, the No Observed Effect Level (NOEL) was 
deemed to be 167 and 500 mg/kg/day in the rat and dog, respectively.  In both species, the main 
findings at higher doses were associated with local tolerance issues at the injection site.  In the 13-
Assessment report

week rat study, malignant lymphomatous infiltration in the liver, spleen, lung and sternal bone marrow 
was seen in one male dosed at 65 mg/kg/day (low dose), but it is unclear as to the link between the 
development of this finding and the presence of abscesses. Since this was only recorded in one animal 
with no dose response and was not seen in any other non-clinical species and the proposed clinical 
duration is of a short duration (<28 days), it is unlikely to translate into a clinical risk. In the dog, no 
major test article-related effects were noted at any dose.  In both species the No Observed Adverse 
Effect Level (NOAEL) was deemed to be 250 mg/kg/day. In the 4-week rat IV combination study, the 
derivation of the NOEL was not agreed since the animals dosed at 2000/500 mg/kg/day CAZ-AVI did 
not complete the full 28 day study duration, which is needed to support this MAA. However, since there 
were no major findings in the clinical safety studies the data obtained over 14 days in the rat is 
accepted. In the 4-week IV combination study in the dog, emesis, excessive salivation (mainly in the 
females), together with increases in cholesterol, triglycerides and liver weights (with associated 
centrilobular hypertrophy) indicated an effect of ceftazidime. Lower systolic and diastolic blood 
pressures in males at 1000 mg/kg/day ceftazidime (alone or in combination) were also attributed to 
ceftazidime. At 500 mg/kg/day ceftazidime (in combination with avibactam at 125 mg/kg/day) there 
were no effects on systolic or diastolic blood pressure. There are currently no reports of blood pressure 
effects in the clinical studies with ceftazidime. 
No major systemic toxicity was observed with avibactam or ceftazidime either alone or in combination; 
the main issue identified was local tolerance at the injection site in all non-clinical species used.  The 
clinical relevance of this has been taken into account since the applicant has stated that adverse drug 
reactions were seen in the clinical trials with avibactam but there were no reports of severe reactions 
or patient discontinuations due to injection site tolerability. No new effects or unexpected toxicities 
were observed when avibactam was administered in combination with ceftazidime in a 1:4 ratio to rats 
and dogs compared to the individual agents. 
Avibactam tested negative in the Ames assay, unscheduled DNA synthesis, chromosomal aberration 
assay and rat micronucleus test.  No carcinogenicity studies were conducted with avibactam alone or in 
combination with ceftazidime. 
Avibactam did not affect female fertility/reproductive performance or embryofoetal development 
following repeat IV administration to rats at doses up to 250 mg/kg/day. Small decreases in 
epididymal and prostate weights at 1000 mg/kg/day in the male fertility study were considered to be a 
secondary effect to a decrease in bodyweight gain at all doses. Two malformed foetuses at 500 
mg/kg/day (one with domed head, protruding tongue, malrotated right hindlimb and hyperextension of 
the right forepaw and a second with scoliosis) and at 1000 mg/kg/day (anophthalmia) were reported in 
the rat embryofoetal development study.  Given that not all external, visceral, and skeletal 
malformations were noted in the background data and that exposure to avibactam at 500 mg/kg/day 
was higher than that at 1000 mg/kg/day, the applicant’s conclusion that the findings did not suggest 
an involvement of avibactam was questioned.  However, since there were no malformations and no 
overall effects on embryo-foetal development at 250 mg/kg/day, the exposures at this dose were 
considered as an appropriate reference for a no observed effect level (NOEL) for embryofoetal changes 
in the rat. In the rabbit embryo/foetal development study, there was an increased post-implantation 
loss at 1000 mg/kg/day and lower mean foetal weights with slightly retarded ossification of the 
metacarpal of the first digit, tarsal bone and sixth sternebra was observed at 300 mg/kg/day and 
above. These findings have been adequately addressed in the Zavicefta SmPC. There were no other 
overt findings at 100 mg/kg/day and this dose is therefore deemed to be the NOEL for embryofoetal 
changes in the rabbit and the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for maternal toxicity.

Avibactam administered alone during pregnancy and lactation to F0 rats was associated with a dose-
related increase in the incidence of renal pelvic dilatation (without recovery) and ureter dilatation, with 
no associated pathological changes to the renal parenchyma. Ureter dilatation was not seen in the 
young adult offspring. The dose of 120 mg/kg/day is considered to be the NOEL.  The possibility that 
these findings may be relevant for humans cannot be excluded, and this aspect has been adequately 
addressed in the Zavicefta SmPC. In the juvenile rat study, renal cortical cysts were observed in all 
groups, including controls and were still present at the end of the 5 week recovery phase. Evidence 
from two additional supportive studies and the lack of renal cysts in the repeat dose toxicity studies in 
the same species/strain of rat, suggests that the findings are background lesions from one specific 
breeding facility and therefore unlikely to have any clinical significance. Additional information also 
suggests that the cysts are substantially distinct from human polycystic renal disease and that since 
nephrogenesis is still ongoing in juvenile rats, whereas it is complete by 34 weeks gestation in 
humans, the renal findings observed in the juvenile rats are unlikely to be relevant for humans. 
Furthermore, the cysts in the rat juvenile toxicity study covered a small proportion of the cortex, did 
not appear to have any significant implications for the animals, are known to be a common background 
finding in the developing kidney of Sprague-Dawley rats, which are not seen in young adult animals 
and appeared to produce only a little or no morphological change.  Overall, it can be considered that 
the cortical cysts have little relevance for humans, and would have no clinical impact should they arise. 
No reproductive studies were conducted with ceftazidime in combination with avibactam based on the 
results observed with the individual compounds. This is considered acceptable by CHMP.  
All impurities which require qualification according to ICH guidelines (ICH Q3B (R2)) have been 
adequately qualified in the toxicology studies.  The potential impurity AZ1359137 was negative in a 
mutagenic assay and is therefore considered a non-mutagenic impurity and should be treated as such 
by the applicant. 
The study on ceftazidime transformation in water/sediment systems (OECD 308) shows that both main 
transformation products M1 and M3 are very persistent as the DT50 values in the low organic content 
(LOC) system are higher than 60 days.  As a result, Zavicefta should be considered as very persistent. 
The revised PEC/PNEC ratios indicate that avibactam and ceftazidime are unlikely to present a risk to 
sediment dwelling organisms.   
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
CHMP agreed that the non-clinical data do not point to any major concerns and that the clinically 
relevant findings have been adequately addressed in the Zavicefta SmPC.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The Applicant has presented in this file 12 clinical pharmacology studies conducted with AVI and/or 
CAZ-AVI as well as 5 studies that provided PK data on AVI when given alone or co-administered with 
ceftaroline. PK data (sparse sampling only) were also obtained from infected patients in the phase 2 
and 3 studies and were incorporated into the POPPK and PK/PD (simulations of PTA) analyses. 
For phase 1 and phase 2 clinical studies (except for three which used the final formulation) CAZ and 
AVI were supplied in separate vials for co-administration as a single infusion solution. The formulation 
used in Phase 3 studies, which contains sodium carbonate, is the same as the commercial product. 
Infusion concentrations in the clinical studies ranged from 4 to 24 mg/mL CAZ and from 0.2 to 16 
mg/mL AVI. The infusion durations varied from 30 to 120 minutes. The Applicant proposed the 
inclusion of the 120 minutes duration in the Product Information and CHMP agreed.  
CAZ and AVI (NXL-104) were the active moieties measured. There is no evidence that any CAZ and 
AVI metabolites are pharmacologically active. Due to low and concentration-independent plasma 
protein binding, total drug concentrations (bound plus free) were measured in human plasma and 
urine using validated HPLC/MS-MS methods.  
Absorption  
In a single dose study with AVI ± CAZ (NXL104-1001) AVI Cmax was generally observed at the end 
of the infusion and then concentrations declined rapidly in a poly-exponential manner (2 or 3 phases). 
CAZ Cmax also occurred at the end of the infusion and then concentrations declined quite rapidly in a 
poly-exponential manner (2 phases). 
In a multiple dose study of AVI, CAZ and CAZ-AVI (D4280C00011) Part A explored the PK of AVI 
and CAZ after single and multiple doses of 2g/500 mg q8h for 11 days using 2 h infusions. The AVI 
plasma concentration-time profiles showed no obvious accumulation after 10 days (RAUC0-T 0.998 on 
day 4 and 0.957 on day 11). There was no accumulation of CAZ. There was no evidence of time-
dependent kinetics for CAZ or AVI after multiple dosing.

Part B was a definitive study of interaction between CAZ and AVI. There was no interaction detected 
between the two components of CAZ-AVI.

Distribution 
Protein binding 
o 
In in-vitro studies AVI binding to human plasma proteins was 5.7% to 8.2% and was not 
concentration-dependent (up to 50 μg/mL). In PTA simulations the 8.2% value was applied. 
o  CAZ human plasma protein binding is stated to be from 5% to 22.8% in the literature and a 
value of 15% was applied in PK/PD modelling and simulations of PTA. 
ELF penetration  
D4280C00009 assessed concentrations of CAZ-AVI in bronchial ELF and plasma in healthy subjects 
who received either CAZ-AVI 2 g/0.5 g or 3 g/1 g infused in 100 mL over 2 h q8h for 3 days (9 doses). 
Each subject underwent a single bronchoscopy with BAL at defined post-dose intervals. The AVI 
median Tmax was at the end of infusion in plasma and ELF. The t1/2 in ELF (1.94 h) appeared slightly 
shorter vs. plasma but this may reflect the limited sampling schedule in ELF. The Cmax and AUCτ 
values in ELF were approximately 28%-35% and 32%-35% of the plasma Cmax and AUCτ, 
respectively. The elimination patterns were similar from ELF and plasma. Similar findings applied to 
CAZ concentrations with Cmax and AUCτ in ELF that were approximately 23%-26% and 31%-32% of 
the plasma values, respectively.  
Compartmental POPPK modelling of CAZ and AVI in ELF was performed. For CAZ and AVI the ELF data 
were best described by an instantaneous equilibrium model between plasma and ELF compartment. 
ELF concentrations are assumed to be free concentrations.  
Assessment report

Page 61/120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
o  For CAZ some non-linearity was evident such that at high concentrations penetration is 
saturable, giving higher estimated ELF penetration at lower plasma concentrations than 
previously estimated. As the plasma:ELF ratios for CAZ are higher at lower concentrations, 
which are achieved at later time points, this results in ELF concentrations being maintained at 
levels around the plasma PK/PD targets for at least 50% of the dosing interval. 
o  For AVI saturation was less evident but at lower plasma concentrations the penetration into 
ELF was also greater than previously estimated. At the later time points, the ELF 
concentrations are maintained around the plasma PK/PD targets of 1 mg/L, although ELF 
PK/PD targets are expected to be lower. 
Elimination 
In D4280C00008 6 healthy male volunteers received a single IV infusion administration containing ~ 
500 mg [14C]AVI in ~ 100 mL of saline over ~ 60 min after an overnight fast. An average of 97.22% of 
administered radioactivity was recovered during the study, with 97.02% from the urine and 0.20% 
from the faeces. Over 95% of the administered radioactivity was recovered from urine within 12 h and 
62.43% was recovered in the first 2 h post-infusion. An average of 84.89% of administered AVI was 
recovered from the urine during the study, with over 50% being recovered within 2 h of the start of 
the infusion. Renal clearance of AVI was 9479 mL/h (i.e. 158 mL/min) on average, which is greater 
than GFR, suggesting active tubular secretion. Individual values ranged from 7810 to 12600 mL/h. The 
t½ for AVI ranged from 2.14 to 3.56 h (arithmetic mean t½=2.778 h). The gmean total clearance was 
11200 mL/h (range 9070 to 14000 mL/h). Renal clearance represented approximately 85% of total 
clearance. There was little penetration of AVI into red blood cells. 
Metabolite profiling indicated that AVI was the major drug-related component in human plasma. A [14C] 
related uncharacterised product (M13) was observed but it was also observed to a similar extent in 
control plasma fortified with [14C]AVI and processed similar to the pooled plasma from the study, 
indicating that M13 may arise from the sample processing. Avibactam accounted for 93% of the 
excreted radioactivity in urine over 24 h and decarbonylated avibactam (M1) accounted for 
approximately 7%. Approximately 97% of the dose was excreted in the urine in the period 0 to 24 h, 
of which 90% was avibactam and 7% was M1. M1 was not identified in human plasma but it was found 
in the dosing solution, suggesting that it may result from non-enzymatic processes. The amount of M1 
was not quantified in the dosing solution.

In NXL104-1001 after single doses of AVI given alone the Cmax and AUC generally showed dose 
proportionality over 50-2000 mg. Assuming the power model, when the dose increased by 2-fold 
within this range, Cmax increased by 2.07 (CI 90% [2.00-2.14]) and AUC0-∞ by 2.08 (CI 90% [2.04-
2.12]). For both Cmax and AUC, a trend toward a slightly over-proportional increase was suspected 
but no formal statistical conclusion could be drawn. In NXL104-1002 after multiple dosing q8h the 
day 5 data showed that when the dose increased by 2-fold within the 500-1000 mg dose range, AVI 
Cmax increased by 1.40 (CI 90%=[0.95-2.07]) and AUC0-8 increased by 1.62 (CI 90%=[1.34-1.97]) 
respectively. For both Cmax and AUC, the lower bound of the 90% CI of β was below the lower limit of 
the reference CI for β [0.68-1.32]. There was no evidence of time-dependent kinetics for avibactam or 
ceftazidime after multiple dosing. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
o  The first POPPK analyses (CAZ-MS-01 and CAZ-MS-05) demonstrated that the primary 
covariates that impact the PK of ceftazidime and avibactam are CrCL and patient population 
(i.e. patients with cIAI or cUTI vs. healthy subjects).  
o  A further analysis (CAZ-MS-06) included data from 78 NP patients enrolled into REPROVE.  
o  During the procedure the applicant updated the CAZ and AVI POPPK models (CAZ-MS-07) with 
additional patient data compared to the prior model (CAZ-MS-06) as shown below. 
Table 15: Breakdown of phase 3 ceftazidime and avibactam subjects by study, population 
and inclusion in the previous MS-06 analysis 
Plasma concentration data were available from 308 patients (109 with VAP and 199 with HAP) in 
REPROVE. The updated model predicted similar plasma exposures in patients with HAP or VAP 
compared with patients with cIAI.

From this updated analysis, patients with NP were predicted to achieve exposures that exceed the 
PK/PD targets in at least 95% of patients up to an MIC of 8 mg/L (see table below). Based on the 
blinded demography dataset from REPROVE, 9% of patients have CrCL >180 mL/min. Thus, the 
applicant considered that the adequacy of the dose in patients with augmented renal clearance (ARC) 
was supported by both the comparable exposure in NP vs. patients with cIAI and the updated PTA 
analysis. Using the updated POPPK model, the table puts the predicted exposures in HAP/VAP patients 
and PTA into context.

Special populations 
Effects of renal function 
NXL104-1003 assessed the effects of impaired renal function on AVI using a 100 mg dose. Renal 
clearance was almost directly proportional to CrCL and accounted for up to 95% of total clearance in 
subjects with normal function with an average of 75% to 80% in those with mild or moderate 
impairment and 55% in severe impairment. Plasma concentrations increased as renal function 
decreased. The mean haemodialysis clearance was ~80% of the mean CLr at normal renal function 
(11.93 L/h). Between 38 and 67 mg of a 100 mg dose was removed by a 4 h dialysis session.  
In CXL-PK-04 hospitalised adults with augmented renal clearance (ARC) and SIRS with suspected or 
documented infection (i.e. sepsis) received 600 mg q8h AVI (with ceftaroline). The mean CrCL was 
190.38. The gmean clearance of AVI increased by 39.5% in ARC compared with healthy subjects, 
giving 28.4% lower AUC0-t for AVI. The updated POPPK models for CAZ and AVI included data from 
101 patients with CrCL CG 150 to 180 mL/min and a further 76 with CrCLCG 180 to 395 mL/min. For 
MICs ≤8 mg/L the average target attainment was 99% and 97.4%, respectively.

Table 18: Comparison of ceftazidime and avibactam exposure and target attainment in 
phase 3 patients stratified across different renal function groups 
For AVI the impact of CrCL was greatest at <80 mL/min. CrCL >80 mL/min leads to modest further 
increases in CL (25.4% per 100 mL/min increase in CrCL above 80 mL/min), implying an increase of 
43.2% in AVI clearance as CrCL increases from 80 to 250 mL/min.  
For CAZ the impact of CrCL is greatest at <100 mL/min. Higher estimated CrCL results in modest 
further increases in CL (12.5% per 100 mL/min increase at >100 mL/min). 
Other intrinsic factors 
NXL104-1004 compared AVI PK after a 500 mg dose in four cohorts defined by gender and age 18-45 
years or ≥ 65 years. Mean Cmax was lowest for the elderly males while CV% was highest for the 
elderly females. Mean AUC 0-t was higher for the elderly females, who also had the lowest mean CL. 
Inter-subject variability was low for AUC0-t and AUC0-inf in all cohorts (12.6 to 23.3%). The t1/2 was 
slightly longer for the elderly and mean Vss was highest for elderly males. The ANOVA analysis 
suggested that: 
•  Age affects AUC but not Cmax  
•  Gender affects Cmax but not AUC 
The updated POPPK models for CAZ and AVI (see above) took into account PK data from 167 patients 
aged 75-89 years. There is a modest increase in the predicted CAZ and AVI AUCs in patients aged 65-
75 and 75-89 years vs. <65 years.

Table 19: Comparison of ceftazidime and avibactam exposure and target attainment in 
phase 3 patients stratified across different age groups 
Overall in the Phase 3 studies, there were 369 patients with mild renal impairment. In this group the 
average AUCss,0-24 is 1213 mg.h/L for CAZ and 175 mg.h/L for AVI. These values closely resemble 
those in the older age groups, reflecting the fact that 61% with mild renal impairment were aged >65 
years. The potential effect of age was tested in the CAZ and AVI POPPK models and found not to 
improve the fit to the data. Therefore, age does not appear as a covariate in the final model for either 
CAZ or AVI.  
The updated POPPK models were used to derive exposure and target attainment in Phase 3 patients by 
obesity class. The final PK models for CAZ and AVI include an effect of weight on the central volume of 
distribution. An increase in the volume of distribution with increasing weight results in an increase in 
the t1/2 and a decrease in Cmax. The increase in the terminal half-life maintains the concentrations 
above the appropriate thresholds for longer periods, resulting in an average joint target attainment of 
100% in obesity class III and greater than 98% in all other obesity categories.  
Table 20: Comparison of ceftazidime and avibactam exposure and target attainment in 
phase 3 patients stratified across different obesity classes 
The interaction between obesity and CrCL in terms of AUCs of CAZ and AVI showed that the lowest 
exposures occur in patients with CrCL >150 mL/min but the average target attainment is still >90%.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No metabolism of AVI was observed in human hepatocytes.  AVI showed no significant inhibition of 
CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP2E1 or UGT1A1. It also 
displayed no induction potential of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4 within the clinically 
relevant exposure range. CAZ showed no induction of CYP1A1/2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4/5. AVI and CAZ 
do not inhibit MDR1, BCRP, MRP4, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3 or BSEP in the 
clinically relevant exposure range. AVI is not a substrate of MDR1, BCRP, MRP4, or OCT2, but it is a 
substrate of human OAT1 and OAT3 in vitro. 
D4280C00012 investigated the effects of co-administration of CAZ-AVI (2 g/500 mg) and 
metronidazole (500 mg) in healthy volunteers and found no evidence of interaction. 
Discussion on pharmacokinetics 
In healthy subjects who received the proposed clinical regimen there was a <10% difference in AVI PK 
parameters from days 1-11 of dosing with CAZ-AVI. There was no effect of co-administration on CAZ 
or AVI PK after dosing from days 1-4 with each agent alone and together. In general, the two agents 
are well matched for use together using q8h administrations. Both have short plasma half-lives and 
rapid, mainly renal, excretion of intact drug. In addition, they show approximate dose linearity, have 
similar volumes of distribution, similar penetration ratios into ELF and low plasma protein binding. 
In the AVI mass balance study there was almost complete recovery of radioactivity in urine within 12 
h. Renal clearance of AVI accounted for 85% of total clearance and suggested some contribution from 
active tubular secretion. Most of the radioactivity in plasma and urine was associated with intact AVI. 
AVI accounted for 90% of the excreted radioactivity in urine over 24 h and decarbonylated avibactam 
(M1) accounted for approximately 7%. 
The data and the POPPK-predicted exposures in subjects and patients with renal impairment, normal 
function or ARC indicated the need for an appropriate schema of dose adjustments for infected patients 
with reduced renal function. This is discussed in the next section since it relied on estimates of PTA and 
not just PK data. The data, including the PTA, indicated that dose adjustment is not necessary in ARC. 
The data, POPPK-predicted exposures and PTA indicate that dose adjustment is not necessary on the 
basis of age, gender, race or body weight/BMI.  
The final POPPK analysis, which included PK data from patients with HAP and VAP, supported a 
conclusion that that the recommended dose and dose adjustments should suffice for treatment of NP, 
including VAP, although efficacy data will come only post-approval from REPROVE. CHMP considered 
that, taking into account use of the approved dose of CAZ, lack of interaction with AVI and the PTA, 
supported by the ELF data, there was sufficient evidence to allow a standalone indication for treatment 
of HAP, including VAP. The Zavicefta SmPC further clarifies the basis for the indication. 
The risk of clinically significant drug-drug-interactions to occur with CAZ-AVI appears to be low. AVI 
was found to be a substrate of OAT1 and OAT3, which may contribute to its active uptake from blood 
and influence excretion. Since probenecid inhibited AVI uptake by 56% to 70% it may decrease AVI 
elimination and, in the absence of a clinical DDI study, co-administration is not recommended.  
In summary, CHMP concluded that the PK of CAZ and AVI, alone and together, are straightforward. For 
the most part they are handled in a similar fashion after clinical dosing and inter-subject variability is 
low or at most moderate. The data do not point to any major concerns and have been adequately 
represented in the Zavicefta SmPC.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Ceftazidime is a cephalosporin antibacterial agent with a mechanism of action that is the same as for 
all other beta-lactam agents, i.e. inhibition of peptidoglycan formation. 
Avibactam is a first-in-class non-β-lactam β-lactamase inhibitor that is able to inhibit class A ESBLs and 
carbapenemases, class C β-lactamases and some class D oxacillinases and carbapenemases. It has no 
inhibitory activity against the class B metallo-enzymes. Structurally, it is a diazabicyclo-octanone 
(DABCO) derivative that employs a reactive urea group to inhibit serine β-lactamases. Inhibition of β-
lactamases is covalent but reversible, such that active AVI is generated by reverse deacylation rather 
than undergoing hydrolysis to an inactive, ring opened form. In-vitro studies using purified enzymes 
gave IC50 values <200 nM except for some class D and all class B enzymes tested. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Avibactam has weak antibacterial activity (MICs typically >16 mg/L) but MICs of 8 mg/L were 
observed for some E. coli, possibly via weak binding to PBP2. It does not induce ampC enzymes at < 
32 mg/L. 
The most relevant data for this application pertain to the activity of CAZ-AVI against CAZ-R pathogens. 
Studies included strains engineered to express single specific enzymes. For enzymes within range of 
inhibition by AVI, testing AVI at a fixed concentration of 4 mg/L (shown from panels of organisms to be 
optimal for separating predicted susceptible vs. resistant organisms) in combination with CAZ resulted 
in MICs for the combination that were mostly ≤ 1 mg/L for E. coli, ≤ 2 mg/L for K. pneumoniae and ≤ 
4 mg/L for P. aeruginosa. 
In addition, the in-vitro activity of CAZ-AVI was evaluated in a global surveillance program and a 
specific surveillance study of bacterial isolates from patients with HAP/VAP. In summary: 
o  For Enterobacteriaceae the CAZ-AVI MIC90 values ranged from 0.12 to 2 mg/L vs. 1 to 128 
mg/L for CAZ alone.  
o  The CAZ-AVI MIC was ≤8 mg/L against 82% of 251 Enterobacteriaceae that were resistant to 
all available carbapenems. 
o  For P. aeruginosa the MIC90 values ranged from 4 to 8 mg/L vs. 8 to 64 mg/L for CAZ alone. In 
2012 89% of 384 meropenem-non-susceptible isolates had CAZ-AVI MICs ≤8 mg/L. 
o 
In the study of HAP/VAP isolates the CAZ-AVI MIC90 against all P. aeruginosa was 8 mg/L, 
including 86% of 207 isolates from VAP patients. 
Beta-lactamase characterisation studies using clinical isolates 
The molecular in-vitro characterisation of β-lactamase resistance mechanisms was carried out for the 
Gram-negative pathogens collected during the Phase 3 studies (see next section for details) that met 
pre-specified MIC criteria and focused on isolates with CAZ MIC ≥8 mg/L. They were investigated for 
the presence of β-lactamase mechanisms, including genes encoding ESBLs or carbapenemases and 
upregulation of transcription of chromosomal blaAmpC. Further analyses were conducted to relate the 
mechanism of resistance to efficacy in the mMITT populations. 
Genes were grouped as follows for the purpose of these β-lactamase analyses: 
o  Category I genes encode β-lactamases expected to be inhibited by AVI 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/377887/2016  
Page 70/120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
o  Category II genes encode β-lactamases not expected to be inhibited by AVI 
o  Category III genes encode β-lactamases inhibited by AVI but not able to hydrolyse CAZ  
An exception was OXA-48, which does not confer resistance to CAZ but does confer resistance to 
carbapenems. OXA-48 producers frequently produce other ESBLs that confer resistance to CAZ and 
these organisms were included in Category I. 
Conclusions from RECLAIM: 
Across treatment groups 105/823 (12.8%) mMITT patients had baseline isolates with Category I β-
lactamases. CAZ-AVI was associated with a cure rate for patients with ESBL-producers of 28/32 and 
for class C producers of 10/13 in the mMITT population. Two patients infected with P. aeruginosa with 
CAZ-AVI MICs of 8 mg/L were clinical cures.

and resistance mechanism (mMITT population) 
Conclusions from REPRISE: 
Across treatment groups 292/302 (96.7%) mMITT patients had baseline isolates with Category I β-
lactamases and most (289, 96%) did not have Category II β-lactamases. The clinical cure rates at TOC 
were >90% for cUTI and cIAI combined for CAZ-AVI and best available therapy [BAT] groups. 
Favourable microbiologic response rates at TOC were higher in the CAZ-AVI group 116/139 (83.5%) 
vs. 86/134 (64.2%) in the BAT group. Similar patterns were seen for the commonest species 
(Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and those with the commonest β-lactamases (CTX-M-15-
like and class C). There were six patients for whom pathogens had CAZ-AVI MICs of 8 mg/L and all 
were clinical and microbiological responders.

Conclusions from RECAPTURE: 
Across treatment groups in the mMITT analysis set ~20% per group with screened isolates were 
infected with pathogens selected for study. Overall, 147/810 (18.1%) had isolates possessing Category 
I without Category II β-lactamase genes (71/393 CAZ-AVI and 76/417 doripenem). Of these 147, 12 
CAZ-AVI and 13 doripenem patients had isolates with only Category I genes.  
The microbiological response rates at TOC in these 147 patients were 62.0% for CAZ-AVI and 59.2% 
for doripenem with a similar pattern for the commonest species (E. coli and K. pneumoniae). For ESBL 
producers the corresponding rates were 63.9% and 57.4% and for those with class C enzyme genes 
the rates were 47.1% vs. 81.8%.

PK-PD index for CAZ: 
Andes and Craig (2002) showed that ~30% fT>MIC CAZ was related to bacteriostasis over 24 h for 
Enterobacteriaceae in the neutropenic mouse lung infection model while 2 to 3 log 10 kill was achieved 
by ~50% fT>MIC. For P. aeruginosa, stasis was achieved in the neutropenic thigh infection model at 
~40% fT>MIC CAZ of ceftazidime (Craig 2003). Based on clinical data for CAZ 2 g q8h and 2-h 
infusions Muller et al (2013)  reported that in patients with NP, including VAP, due to Gram-negative 
bacilli a %fT>MIC CAZ of ≥ 45% was associated with a favourable outcome. In another retrospective 
exposure-response analysis in patients with VAP due to Gram-negative bacilli MacVane et al (2014) 
reported that ≥ 53% fT>MIC CAZ was associated with microbiological success. A value of 50% fT>MIC 
CAZ was used as the target for PTA analyses. A protected CAZ MIC ≤ 8 mg/L (i.e. measured in the 
presence of 4 mg/L AVI) included ≥ 90% of clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa so 
this was selected as the CAZ MIC target for dose setting. 
PK-PD index for avibactam 
This was derived from hollow-fibre models and animal models of infection and concluded to be related 
to the percentage of the dosing interval in which free avibactam exceeded the required threshold (i.e. 
%fT>CT). In the hollow-fibre model using CAZ-R Enterobacteriaceae, a minimum CT of 0.5 mg/L 
avibactam was shown to be the appropriate PK/PD index for avibactam. Using the neutropenic mouse 
thigh infection model with P. aeruginosa, a mean %fT>CT of 40% for a CT of 1 mg/L avibactam was 
associated with bacterial stasis and a mean %fT>CT of 50% for a CT of 1 mg/L was associated with 1-
log kill. Using the neutropenic mouse lung infection model with P. aeruginosa, the mean %fT>CT 
values for a CT of 1 mg/L associated with stasis, 1-log kill and 2-log kill were 20%, 24% and 30%, 
respectively. From these results the CT was set at 1 mg/L. 
The overall target exposure for CAZ-AVI was simultaneously achieving 50% fT>MIC for CAZ MIC of 8 
mg/L while maintaining 50% fT>CT of 1 mg/L for avibactam. 
Phase 3 dose selection based on PTA 
Because PK/PD targets could not be identified from the E-R analyses the nonclinical targets described 
above were used in Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) to estimate the PTA. Dose selection was based on 
the achievement of a high (>90%) joint PTA (see above) for patients with cIAI, cUTI or NP.  
The CAZ-AVI dose regimen used for the Phase 2 study in patients with cIAI (NXL104-2002) was 2 
g/0.5 g q8h using 30-min infusions for patients with CrCL >80 mL/min. The PTA analysis predicted that 
this dose regimen had inadequate joint PTA (<90%) at the CAZ-AVI MIC of 8 mg/L but prolongation of 
the infusion time to 120 min would increase the joint PTA to >90%. Therefore the Phase 3 regimen 
differed from the Phase 2 regimen only in terms of infusion time.  
CAZ-AVI was not studied in any patients with NP prior to the start of REPROVE. Based on the PK 
analyses discussed under PK in the target population (see Table 10 for a summary) the applicant 
considers that the same dose can be used for NP and cIAI. To understand the potential impact of ARC 
in patients with NP, covariate distributions of CrCL that were biased towards high CrCL were used in 
the simulations and > 90% PTA was demonstrated.  
Simulation of exposure and PTA analysis following Phase 3 
To summarise the PTA using the applicant’s revised dose recommendations by indication (i.e. refined 
after completing RECLAIM; see further below), the table below shows that PTA adequate at 8 mg/L and 
the adjusted doses for renal impairment are predicted to give PTA adequate to cover MICs of 16 mg/L.

Table 22 
Predicted joint PTA for the T4 PK/PD endpoint (50% fT>MIC for CAZ and 50% 
fT>1,0 mg/L for AVI) in simulated patients with cIAI, cUTI, HAP(NP) and VAP 
by renal function groups with associated dose adjustments 
Using the updated POPPK model, additional PTA simulations were conducted that extended the 
exploration of performance of dose to include ≥60% fT>MIC and simultaneous CT>1 mg/L, i.e. an 
even more conservative joint target. Based on these more stringent targets and for a CAZ-AVI MIC of 
8 mg/L the PTA exceeds 98% for all recommended doses of CAZ-AVI. Also, PTA >95% is predicted to 
be achieved for 70% fT>ceftazidime and avibactam targets. Thus, even if higher durations of exposure 
to the drug are needed to inhibit growth of certain clinical genera of clinical pathogens that produce β-
lactamases within the spectrum of inhibition of AVI the recommended dose of CAZ-AVI is still predicted 
to be effective.

Confirmation of the suitability of the Phase 3 dose for patients with limited treatment options 
The applicant concludes that the above analyses support bridging the efficacy seen in RECLAIM to 
justify using the same dose regimen to treat other infections due to aerobic Gram-negative organisms. 
Clinical efficacy data are not available for all β-lactamases that hydrolyse CAZ and are inhibited by AVI. 
An extrapolation is proposed to be justified based on:  
- 
In-vitro data and animal infection models using organisms producing representatives of the 
TEM,   SHV, CTX-M, CMY, PER, AmpC and KPC-type enzymes and multiple enzymes 
-  Clinical efficacy

The understanding that the PK-PD relationship is not affected by β-lactamase production 
Dose adjustments for patients with renal impairment 
In RECLAIM, RECLAIM3, RECAPTURE and REPRISE dose adjustments were implemented for patients 
with CrCL ≤ 50 mL/min. The dose adjustments were based on those approved for CAZ, taking into 
account that the impact of renal impairment is similar for each of CAZ and AVI. 
Following completion of RECLAIM, a subgroup efficacy analysis indicated that patients with moderate 
renal impairment treated with CAZ-AVI had a lower clinical cure rate vs. meropenem. More than half of 
the CAZ-AVI patients (24/41; 58.5%) and meropenem patients (26/43; 60.5%) with estimated CrCL ≤ 
50 mL/min at baseline had rapid increases in estimated CrCL (within 48 h) while on study. The 
majority of these patients had an appropriate increase in the frequency and dose of CAZ-AVI or 
meropenem. However, since serum creatinine was estimated intermittently there were periods in 
which the dose regimen lagged behind the improvements in estimated CrCL.  
The PK sampling time point was at Day 3, at which time the plasma exposures for CAZ and AVI were 
broadly comparable between patients with normal renal function or mild or moderate renal impairment 
at baseline. These data do not capture the first 72 h, during which some patients may have been 
under-dosed for variable periods.  
For example, the table below shows that in patients who shift from moderate renal impairment to 
normal renal function, the adjusted dose (1 g/0.25 g q12h) provides a very low joint PTA (13.5%). 
The impact of under-dosing on PTA was predicted to be relatively greater for CAZ-AVI because the 
dose was reduced to one-third whereas for meropenem the dose was reduced to two-thirds and would 
give 41% PTA for MICs 2 mg/L (the susceptibility breakpoint).

Other plausible CAZ-AVI dose regimens for each renal impairment group were explored by PTA such 
that the total daily dose was increased by 50% compared with the initial renal dose adjustments. As 
shown in the second table, using 1 g/0.25 g q8h in moderate impairment increases the PTA to 55.9% 
for a CAZ-AVI MIC of 8 mg/L for a patient who shifts rapidly to normal renal function.

Similar analyses for patients with cUTI and NP confirmed the suitability of these doses since each 
would have >95% PTA for the joint PK/PD target for those with stable renal function and maintain at 
least 70% PTA if there was a rapid improvement to the next category. Therefore the Zavicefta SmPC 
recommends the adjustments shown above rather than those applied during completed Phase 3 
studies. 
Other pharmacodynamic studies 
D4280C00007 was a double blind and placebo controlled TQT study in which 51 male subjects were 
randomized to receive all of the following in 4 treatment sequences with at least 3-day washout 
periods: 
B: 2 g AVI and 3 g CAZ over 30 min plus placebo infusion (saline) over 30 min, each in 125 mL  
C: Moxifloxacin 400 mg oral tablet 
D: Placebo infusion (saline) over 60 min in 2x125 mL volumes 
Total exposure to AVI after a 2 g dose was ~3-fold higher vs. AVI 500 mg given alone. The CAZ dose 
(3 g) resulted in substantially greater systemic exposures than reported with the clinical dose at 2 g. 
Assay sensitivity was confirmed from the comparison between moxifloxacin and placebo. In the 
primary comparison of QTcF with AVI vs. placebo the upper bound of the 2-sided 90% CI did not 
exceed 10 ms at any time point post-dose. Maximum absolute values and changes in QTcF from 
baseline did not exceed the recommended boundaries at any time point. Changes in heart rate, RR, 
PR, QT and QRS intervals were consistent between placebo and CAZ-AVI. 
Breakpoints 
The applicant has presented a rationale for the proposed MIC interpretive breakpoints and has 
approached EUCAST to set interpretive breakpoints for ceftazidime-avibactam in the EU.  
The final susceptibility testing breakpoints established by the EUCAST were: 
Organisms 
Enterobacteriaceae 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
Susceptible 
≤8 mg/L 
≤8 mg/L 
Resistant 
>8 mg/L 
>8 mg/L 
Discussion on pharmacodynamics 
Microbiology 
The inhibitory range of AVI clearly exceeds that of tazobactam, sulbactam and clavulanic acid. AVI is 
being developed for clinical use in combination with several beta-lactam drugs. The CAZ-AVI FDC is the 
first of these combinations to be submitted for regulatory review. 
The selection of CAZ as the partner effectively restricts, with very few exceptions, the clinical utility of 
the FDC to those types of infections in which aerobic Gram-negative pathogens predominate among 
the causative agents. For this reason the indications sought are limited to cIAI, cUTI and NP, all of 
which are already approved for CAZ alone. Nevertheless, CAZ is not active against, or cannot be relied 
upon to treat, certain aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, including Acinetobacter spp., B. cepacia and S. 
maltophilia. There are also some species against which CAZ is commonly active with little or no 
enhancement expected when it is combined with AVI (in particular, P. aeruginosa).  
CAZ-AVI will not overcome all resistance to CAZ. For example, when one of the beta-lactamases 
expressed is not inhibited by AVI (all class B and some class D), when there is extreme over-

expression of an enzyme normally inhibited by AVI and/or when there is a non-enzymic mechanism of 
resistance that limits activity of the combination, such as a porin deficiency.  
The applicant conducted a range of appropriate studies to document the activity of CAZ-AVI against 
CAZ-R pathogens involving various mechanisms. The results supported the findings of the in-vitro 
studies of AVI inhibition of beta-lactamases as well as those using organisms engineered to express 
single beta-lactamases. The use of a fixed concentration of 4 mg/L AVI for in-vitro susceptibility testing 
was based on data from a panel of well-characterised organisms suggesting that this serves to best 
differentiate those organisms predicted to be susceptible (based on mechanisms of resistance) from 
those predicted to be resistant. The concentration has no direct relationship to the human plasma 
concentrations of AVI. This is acceptable since PTA at a pre-defined MIC is based on simulated human 
exposures.   
MICs of CAZ-AVI were not affected by testing in 10% pulmonary surfactant. MICs of CAZ and CAZ-AVI 
increased when the pH decreased from 7 to 5, although for CAZ-AVI the MICs did not exceed 4 mg/L. 
It is unclear whether this finding has potential relevance to activity of CAZ-AVI within the airways in 
which acidic conditions could prevail in association with raised CO2 levels. While ELF penetration was 
shown to be comparable for CAZ and AVI and was taken into account in simulations to estimate PTA, 
there remains some concern regarding the lack of any efficacy data to support use of the combination 
in NP. CAZ alone is indicated for treatment of NP in the EU but the clinical trial evidence to support this 
use was limited. Nevertheless, the additional PK data and the PTA using the updated POPPK models 
(including the assessment of the effect of ARC) are considered to be sufficient to allow an indication for 
use in NP in this particular situation in which the beta-lactam partner is already licensed for this 
indication at the same dose. 
Data on clinical isolates  
During the procedure the applicant provided detailed characterisation of beta-lactamases in isolates 
from patients in Phase 3 studies. Appropriately the focus has been on those with CAZ MICs at least 8 
mg/L expressing enzymes expected to be inhibited by AVI. Overall these data are supportive of the 
adequacy of the AVI dose but there have been very few serine carbapenemases treated with CAZ-AVI 
so far. 
Dose selection 
The steps leading to selection of the PK-PD indices have been clearly described. The individual and 
combined PD targets identified are acceptable. The final estimates of PTA at CAZ-AVI MIC 8 mg/L 
reflect the POPPK analysis that included the Phase 3 sparse sampling data from infected patients who 
received the final proposed dose regimen. Essentially, the applicant’s conclusion regarding the 
sufficiency of the dose can be agreed when MICs are up to 8 mg/L. 
The analyses underlying the revision of the dose adjustments for various degrees of renal impairment 
were considered appropriate by CHMP.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

therapy, for treatment of cUTI, including acute pyelonephritis, in 1031 hospitalised adults. 
RECLAIM3 (D4280C00018) compared CAZ-AVI plus MTZ with meropenem for treatment of cIAI in 
404 hospitalised adults recruited in the Asia-Pacific region. This study has been completed since filing 
the application dossier and a full CSR was submitted.

Study title: 
A phase 3, randomised, multi-centre, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group, 
comparative study to determine the efficacy, safety and tolerability of CAZ-AVI plus 
metronidazole versus meropenem in the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal 
infections in hospitalised adults (D4280C00001/5, RECLAIM study) 
Methods 
Study Participants  
Eligible patients were aged 18 to 90 years of age and were to have either intraoperative/postoperative 
enrolment with visual confirmation (presence of pus within the abdominal cavity) of an intra-abdominal 
infection associated with peritonitis in accordance with the criteria recommended by CHMP. 
The most important exclusion criteria other than those expected for beta-lactams and in line with 
inclusion criteria, were CG-CrCL≤ 30 mL/min or having any type of dialysis and other potentially 
important laboratory findings (e.g. Haematocrit < 25% or haemoglobin < 8 g/dL, Absolute neutrophil 
count < 1,000/mm3, Platelet count < 75,000/mm3, Bilirubin > 3 x ULN, ALP, ALT or AST > 3 x ULN or 
up to 5 x ULN if directly related to the infectious process etc.)

Treatments 
The study was of double blind, double-dummy design. Patients were randomized to CAZ-AVI (2 g/0.5 g 
q8h) in 100 mL over 2 h followed by metronidazole (500 mgq8h) over 1 h or Meropenem (1 g q8h) in 
100 mL over 30 min. 
There were dose adjustments in patients with moderate renal impairment. If CrCL fell below 31 
mL/min on study investigators determined whether to implement a dose change or discontinue 
therapy. If Enterococcus species or MRSA was known or suspected open-label vancomycin, linezolid or 
daptomycin could be added to either study regimen and discontinued based on culture results. 
Objectives 
Primary  
To assess non-inferiority of CAZ-AVI vs. meropenem for cure at TOC in MITT and CE populations  
Secondary  
o  To assess non-inferiority for cure at TOC in mMITT and ME populations  
o  To compare clinical outcomes at EOT and LFU in the various patient populations 
o  To compare per-patient and per-pathogen microbiologic responses at EOT, TOC and LFU 
o  To evaluate efficacy against CAZ-R pathogens 
o  To evaluate CAZ-AVI exposure and the antimicrobial response relationship  
Outcomes/endpoints 
Clinical response definitions at the EOT, TOC and LFU visits were cure, failure and indeterminate.  
An independent expert surgical review panel reviewed all patients assessed as clinical failure by the 
investigator for the adequacy of surgical source control while blinded to IV study therapy. In addition, 
the panel reviewed all patients assessed as clinical cure at TOC and/or LFU by the investigator and who 
underwent an additional procedure to assess whether clinical cure criteria had indeed been met. If the 
SRP determined that the patient met the definition of failure, they went on to further assess whether 
source control was adequate. If it was determined that source control at the study qualifying procedure 
was adequate, the patient’s final clinical response was failure. If it was determined that there was 
inadequate source control, the final clinical response was indeterminate. If a discrepancy existed in 
clinical outcome, the SRP’s assessment prevailed. 
Cultures from the intra-abdominal site of infection and blood were collected at the time of surgery. 
Baseline clinical isolates were shipped to the central laboratory for confirmation of identification and 
susceptibility. If discrepancies existed and could not be resolved the central laboratory results 
prevailed. 
Baseline pathogens included bacteria identified from either intra-abdominal cultures or blood cultures 
which could be reasonably implicated as an aetiologic agent of cIAI. Bacteria for which at least one of 
the study agents would have been an inappropriate choice for empiric treatment (e.g. 
Stenotrophomonas spp. and Acinetobacter spp.), fungi and bacteria considered to be contaminants 
(e.g. S. epidermidis) were not considered baseline pathogens. Classification of baseline pathogens was 
performed by the Microbiology Review Committee. Per-pathogen and per-patient responses were 
determined.

Sample size 
The sample size of the combined study database provided 90% power for a 10% non-inferiority margin 
and > 95% power for a 12.5% margin using 95% confidence intervals. Assuming that both treatments 
had an underlying clinical cure rate of 70% in the mMITT analysis set, 442 randomised patients per 
treatment group were needed. This sample size also provided at least 90% power for the MITT and CE 
analysis sets. Assuming that 80% of all randomised patients were included in the mMITT analysis set, 
553 randomised patients per treatment group (1106 total) were needed across the two studies.  
Randomisation 
Eligible patients were randomised 1:1 to treatment groups using an IVRS/IWRS and a block size of 
4.Patients were stratified by APACHE II score (≤10 or >10 to ≤30) and by region (North America and 
Western Europe, Eastern Europe or ROW). Additionally, the number of patients with a perforated 
appendix or an appendiceal abscess was limited to approximately 40% of the study population in the 
combined study database. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was double-blind with double dummy infusions. The unblinded pharmacist/designee at each 
site was responsible for maintaining accountability and preparing the blinded IV study therapy. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis populations 
MITT analysis set = all randomised and treated who met the disease definition of cIAI  
mMITT analysis set = all randomised who met the disease definition of cIAI and had at least 1 
aetiologic pathogen at study entry except for those not expected to respond to either treatment 
CE analysis set = patients with an appropriate diagnosis of cIAI and (a) received therapy for ≥ 48 h 
with ≥80% of the scheduled drug administered or (b) received therapy for < 48 h before discontinuing 
due to an AE. In addition, these patients had a documented outcome at ≥ 1 of EOT, TOC or LFU visits 
and no important protocol deviations that would affect assessment of efficacy, including adequate 
source control. 
ME analysis set = CE with ≥ 1 Gram-negative aerobic pathogen in the initial/pre-study culture 
susceptible to both treatments 
Extended ME (eME) analysis set = CE patients with ≥ 1 Gram-negative aerobic pathogen in the 
initial/pre-study culture regardless of susceptibility. 
Patients in the CE, ME and eME analysis sets were analysed according to the treatment they received 
while the MITT and mMITT analysis sets were analysed according to randomised treatment. 
Statistical analyses of comparisons between CAZ-AVI vs. meropenem calculated 2-sided 95% CIs using 
the unstratified method of Miettinen and Nurminen (1985). Patients with a missing assessment at the 
EOT, TOC or LFU visit were assigned a clinical response of indeterminate, in which case they were 
counted as failures in the statistical analysis for the mMITT set at the relevant time point.  
Non-inferiority was to be concluded if the lower limit of the 95% CI (corresponding to a 97.5% 1-sided 
lower bound) was greater than –12.5% for the primary outcome variable. Assuming that both 
treatments had an underlying clinical cure rate of 70% in the mMITT analysis set, 442 randomised 
patients per treatment were needed. This number provided at least 90% power for the MITT and CE 
analysis sets. Assuming that 80% of all randomised patients were included in the mMITT analysis set, 
553 randomised patients per treatment group (1106 total) were needed across the two studies.

Results 
There were 1058 patients randomised (529 per treatment group) who received at least one dose of 
assigned study therapy. The majority (89.1% CAZ-AVI and 92.5% meropenem) completed treatment 
and few patients discontinued due to AEs (14 [2.6%] CAZ-AVI and 7 [1.3%] meropenem). The 
majority of patients (~90%) also completed the study.  
Baseline data 
There were no important differences between treatment groups for demographic characteristics in any 
of the primary analysis sets. Mean and median baseline APACHE II scores were 6.5 and 6.0, 
respectively, and scores were ≤ 10 for 84.5% of patients. The majority (91.5%) had normal renal 
function or mild renal impairment while 8.1% had moderate renal impairment. In the MITT analysis 
set, the most common primary diagnoses were appendiceal perforation (41.3%), acute gastric and 
duodenal perforation (18.7%) and cholecystitis (15.7%). About half was enrolled preoperatively 
(48.5% CAZ-AVI and 49.7% meropenem) and 76.8% underwent laparotomy as the initial surgical 
intervention. Prior antibacterial therapy within 72 h before randomisation was reported for 62% per 
group (much of this was metronidazole) but < 6% had received > 24 h and ~6% had a previous 
treatment failure. 
Regarding baseline pathogens: 
o  The mMITT population comprised 77.2% of randomised patients and ≥ 1 Enterobacteriaceae 
was reported for >80% of these patients. 21 [4.2%] CAZ-AVI vs. 14 [2.7%] meropenem 
patients were bacteraemic, with E. coli in 14/35. 
o  Twelve patients were included in the eME but not in the ME at TOC analysis sets due to 13 
Gram-negative aerobic pathogens not susceptible (3) or missing result (10). 
o  For 794 Enterobacteriaceae in the mMITT set the CAZ MIC range was ≤ 0.03 to > 64 μg/mL 
with MIC90 16 μg/mL. Of these, 108 were CAZ-R (MIC ≥ 8 μg/mL), including 59 E. coli, 26 K. 
pneumoniae and 10 E. cloacae. There were also 6 CAZ-R P. aeruginosa (MIC ≥ 16 μg/mL). 
o  For the CAZ-R Enterobacteriaceae the CAZ-AVI MIC range was ≤ 0.008 to > 32 μg/mL with 
an MIC90 of 2 μg/mL. CAZ-AVI MICs > 8 μg/mL occurred in 8 CAZ-R isolates.  
Outcomes and estimation 
In the MITT population 99% received 80-120% of the assigned medication. The median duration was 7 
days for CAZ-AVI vs. 8 days for meropenem and 93.2% vs. 97% received 5-14 days. 
Non-inferiority was demonstrated in the US FDA primary analysis (cure rates in mMITT at TOC) and in 
the CHMP primary analysis (cure rate in MITT and CE at TOC). Sensitivity analyses and analyses of the 
primary outcome adjusted for the pre-specified stratification factors gave results that were consistent 
with the primary analysis in each case.

Forest plots for the MITT analysis set reflected the almost consistent numerical inferiority of CAZ-AVI in 
all subgroups of any reasonable size and in many of the small subgroups. Lower cure rates at TOC 
were observed for CAZ-AVI in patients with APACHE II scores > 10 in each analysis set. In particular, 
in the mMITT set the rates were 59.3% vs. 75.8%. Nevertheless, CHMP agreed that, despite this 
limitation, the benefit-risk of Zavicefta in cIAI was positive (see also uncertainties of the benefit-risk at 
the end of this report)

Ancillary analyses 
In the MITT and mMITT analysis sets the cure rates were 48.8% and 45.2% for CAZ-AVI in patients 
with moderate renal impairment at baseline (MRIB) vs. 74.4% and 74.3%, respectively, in the 
meropenem group. CAZ and AVI plasma exposures on Day 3 were similar for those with CrCL > 30 to 
≤ 50 mL/min vs. > 50 mL/min at baseline. However, based on serum creatinine values there were 
27/41 CAZ-AVI and 30/43 meropenem MITT patients with baseline moderate impairment who had an 
increase on treatment to > 50 mL/min within 72 h so were potentially under-dosed some period of 
time during early treatment.   
To assess whether disease severity could explain the observed treatment difference in the MRIB 
subgroup, a multivariate logistic regression model was constructed using clinical failure as the 
response variable; key variables assessing patient disease severity (including APACHE II score) were 
tested in conjunction with MRIB status. The MRIB by treatment interaction remained even when 
severity of illness factors (including APACHE II, age, diagnosis, type, bacteraemia and serum albumin) 
were corrected for.

o  When MRIB treatment interaction term was included in the model, it was found to be 
significant, indicating that the outcome in MRIB status groups was significantly different 
between treatment arms 
o  When APACHE II category was instead included in the model as the interaction term, this was 
not significant, indicating that outcome in APACHE II category groups was not significantly 
different between treatment arms. 
The investigation was extended to include a range of variables thought to be indicative of severity. A 
series of univariate analyses were performed on potential severity factors (age group [≥75 vs <75 
years old], diagnosis type [appendicitis vs non-appendicitis], bacteraemia, albumin, MRIB status and 
APACHE II category [≤10 vs >10]). All were found to have significant main effects at the 0.2 level, 
indicating they were prognostic of clinical outcome overall but only MRIB had a significant interaction 
with treatment. 
The multivariate analysis was repeated using the severity of illness terms above and including the 
MRIB by treatment interaction term. The result of this analysis showed that the MRIB by treatment 
interaction remained significant (p=0.0467) in a model that corrected for the severity terms. Thus, 
there was statistical evidence of a difference in the treatment effect in the MRIB subgroups when 
severity factors had been corrected for. 
In MITT subgroups with ≥15 patients per treatment arm (21 subsets in total), numerical inferiority in 
the CAZ-AVI group was most prominent in patients recruited into D4280C0005, aged 46 to 64 or 65 to 
74, females, Whites, located at Rest of World sites, with acute gastric and duodenal perforations, who 
had not failed prior therapy, without complication of previous abdominal surgery, with monomicrobial 
infections, enrolled post- or intra-operatively and with MRIB. In each case the 95% CIs spanned zero 
and if patients with MRIB were removed from the analysis the treatment difference was greatly 
reduced or disappeared in the majority of these patient subsets. 
In the mMITT analysis set cure rates at TOC in patients with one or more Enterobacteriaceae were 
81.4% for CAZ-AVI and 86.4% for meropenem. For E. coli (271 CAZ-AVI and 285 meropenem group) 
cure rates at TOC were 80.4% vs. 87.0%, respectively, and failures in the CAZ-AVI group were 
observed at low CAZ-AVI MIC values (commonly these were 0.06 μg/mL and 0.12 μg/mL). Against K. 
pneumoniae the cure rates at TOC were comparable (78.4% and 75.5%) while for P. aeruginosa the 
rates were 85.7% and 94.4%, respectively. Similar results were seen in the extended ME and ME 
analysis sets. 
There were 111 mMITT patients (47 CAZ-AVI and 64 meropenem) with CAZ-R Gram-negative isolates, 
including E. coli in 24 vs. 37 and K. pneumoniae in 13 per treatment group. The cure rates at TOC for 
all Enterobacteriaceae were 81.8% and 85.5%, respectively. In the ME analysis set the clinical cure 
rates at TOC for CAZ-R Enterobacteriaceae were 90.9% and 98.0%, respectively, In the extended ME 
analysis set rates were 88.6% and 98.0%, respectively.

non-China). It was planned to enrol 404 patients, of which ~250 were to be enrolled in China to 
provide ~200 CE Chinese patients. 
Treatments 
Patients randomized to receive CAZ-AVI plus metronidazole, received IV meropenem placebo (0.9% 
saline) immediately followed by IV CAZ-AVI (2000 mg of ceftazidime and 500 mg of avibactam), 
immediately followed by IV metronidazole (500 mg). Patients randomized to receive meropenem, 
received IV meropenem (1000 mg) immediately followed by IV CAZ-AVI placebo (0.9% saline), 
immediately followed by IV metronidazole placebo (0.9% saline). Treatments were repeated every 8 
hours (±30 minutes). Dose adjustments were made for CAZ-AVI or meropenem for patients whose 
creatinine clearance (CrCl) dropped to between 31 and 50 mL/min while on IV study therapy. 
Objectives 
The primary efficacy objective was to assess the non-inferiority of CAZ-AVI plus metronidazole 
compared to meropenem alone with respect to clinical cure at the TOC in patients that were clinically 
evaluable 
Key secondary objectives included determination of the efficacy of CAZ-AVI plus MTZ compared to 
meropenem with respect to: clinical cure across visits and analysis sets, per-patient and per-pathogen 
microbiologic response, pathogens resistant to ceftazidime, and evaluation of the safety and tolerability 
profile of the 2 treatments. 
Results 
There were 432 randomised and treated of which 398 completed treatment and 295 (67%) had at 
least one acceptable baseline pathogen. Demographic, patient and disease characteristics were 
balanced across the treatment groups. The mean age was 48.5 years, with 58 aged 65-74 and 31 aged 
>74 years. The majority (93.3%) had normal renal function or mild renal impairment at baseline. In 
the MITT analysis set, the most common primary diagnoses were appendix perforation or peri-
appendiceal abscess (37.6%), secondary peritonitis (17.2%) and cholecystitis (13.9%). Only 5 CAZ-
AVI and 10 meropenem patients had bacteraemia and only 29 (7%) had APACHE II scores >10-30.  
The primary analysis in the CE population (361 patients; 82% of total) met the pre-defined criterion 
for concluding non-inferiority. After adjustment for stratification factors, the difference in cure rates at 
TOC for CE patients was estimated as 0.4% (95% CI: -4.97 to 5.69).

Results were consistent in the MITT (83.2% vs. 86.6%; -10.33, 3.35) and ME (92.9% vs. 94.7%; -
9.25, 5.09) populations. Rates for the mMITT population were 83.2% vs. 88.8%; -13.8, 2.36). Rates 
for cure at LTFU in the CE population were 157/168 (93.5%) and 168/179 (93.9%).

The cure rates at TOC in the CE population by subgroups were generally consistent with the overall 
results. In patients with APACHE II score >10 to ≤30 the cure rates in the mMITT analysis set were 
5/7 (71.4%) for CAZ-AVI and 12/12 (100%) for meropenem; rates for the CE analysis set were 7/8 
vs. 11/12.  
Clinical cure rates for MITT patients with MRIB were 92.3% for CAZ-AVI (n=13) and 81.3% for 
meropenem (n=16); rates in the mMITT analysis set were 91.7% (n=12) and 81.8% (n=11).  
In the eME population the microbiological response rates at TOC were 93% for CAZ-AVI vs. 95% for 
meropenem (-9.33, 4.63). Corresponding rates in the mMITT population were the same as the clinical 
cure rates reported above.   
Microbiological response rates by pathogen at TOC were 92.9% vs. 96.3% for E. coli and >90% for 
Enterobacteriaceae and ~90% for P. aeruginosa for both treatments. Clinical cure rates at TOC for ME 
patients with CAZ-S Enterobacteriaceae were 91.4% vs. 96.3%, reflecting the rates for E. coli (92.6% 
vs. 96.2%). Clinical responses for CAZ-R pathogens are shown below for the eME population. The 
corresponding rates for the mMITT population were 81.5% for CAZ-AVI and 92.9% for meropenem. 
For CAZ-S and CAZ-R pathogens the microbiological response rates followed the clinical cure rates.

Study title  
An Open-Label, Randomized, Multicenter, Phase III Study of Ceftazidime-Avibactam (CAZ-
AVI) and Best Available Therapy for the Treatment of Infections Due to Ceftazidime-
Resistant Gram-Negative Pathogens (D4280C00006 [REPRISE]) 
Methods 
Study Participants  
Patients had to have cUTI or cIAI due to CAZ-R pathogens. Identification of pathogens and 
susceptibility results were recorded by local and central reference laboratories. The local laboratory 
result is used to determine study eligibility whilst the central laboratory result is used to determine 
inclusion in the mMITT population unless only the local result is available. The central laboratory uses 
CLSI methods while local laboratories may use other methods. 
o  Based on central laboratory results aerobic Gram-negative pathogens with CAZ MICs ≥ 8 
μg/mL for Enterobacteriaceae and ≥ 16 μg/mL for P. aeruginosa are deemed to be CAZ-R. If 
only local laboratory disk testing is available then zone diameters ≤ 20 mm for 
Enterobacteriaceae and ≤ 17 mm for P. aeruginosa are applied. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/377887/2016  
Page 88/120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
o  Susceptibility to CAZ-AVI is provisionally based on MICs ≤8 μg/mL for all aerobic Gram-
negatives and on zone diameters ≥16 mm for Enterobacteriaceae and ≥15 mm for P. 
aeruginosa. 
cIAI Patients 
Inclusion criteria were generally similar to those applied in RECLAIM but patients needed to have at 
least two signs and symptoms suggesting systemic manifestations of infection and peritonitis. 
cUTI Patients 
o  Patients needed to have a positive urine culture in the 5 days prior to screening, containing ≥ 
105 CFU/mL of ≥ one Gram-negative CAZ-R uropathogen and accompanied by pyuria (≥ 10 
WBCs/hpf or ≥ 10 WBCs/mm3 in unspun urine). 
o  Patients had acute pyelonephritis or cUTI defined by the following criteria: 
(a) Acute pyelonephritis indicated by flank pain (with onset or worsening within 7 days of 
enrolment) or costovertebral angle tenderness on examination and ≥ one of i) fever (> 38°C) ± 
rigor, chills or warmth or ii) nausea and/or vomiting 
(b) Complicated lower UTI indicated by qualifying symptoms and ≥ one complicating factor as 
follows: 
Symptoms - at least 2 of the following including at least one Group A symptom (dysuria, urgency, 
frequency, suprapubic pain) and any Group B symptom (fever defined as in pyelonephritis) 
Complicating factors - any of history of urinary retention (male patients), obstructive uropathy 
scheduled to be medically or surgically relieved before EOT, functional or anatomical abnormality of the 
urogenital tract or post-void residual urine volume of at least 100 mL, use of intermittent bladder 
catheterisation or an indwelling bladder catheter for at least 48 h prior to qualifying culture, or any 
urogenital procedure (such as cystoscopy or urogenital surgery) within 7 days before qualifying 
culture. 
Exclusion criteria 
The exclusion criteria were similar to those used in the RECLAIM trial. 
Treatments 
CAZ-AVI was dosed as in RECLAIM with metronidazole added for cIAI patients. The dose of CAZ-AVI is 
adjusted in case of renal impairment.  The preferred BAT options for cUTI were meropenem, 
imipenem, doripenem and colistin. The preferred BAT options for cIAI were meropenem, imipenem, 
doripenem, tigecycline and colistin (latter ± metronidazole for cIAI patients). If another BAT was 
chosen, or combination therapy was given, the investigator had to document the reason.  Intravenous 
therapy (CAZ-AVI or BAT) was continued for 5-21 days as selected by the investigator.  
Objectives 
The primary objective was to estimate the per-patient clinical response to CAZ-AVI and BAT at TOC in 
patients with cIAI or cUTI due to CAZ-R pathogens. The study is not powered for inferential testing. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Clinical and microbiological outcomes in cIAI are assessed as for RECLAIM.  The primary efficacy 
variable for cUTI patients is the microbiological response defined as eradication < 104 cfu/mL and 
persistence ≥ 104 cfu/mL.

Sample size 
Approximately 400 patients (200 CAZ-AVI) with cIAI or cUTI caused by CAZ-R Gram-negative 
pathogens were to be enrolled. The study was not powered for inferential testing. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to CAZ-AVI or their pre-determined BAT using 
IVRS/IWRS with stratification by diagnosis (cIAI or cUTI) and by region.  
Blinding 
This was an open label study. 
Statistical methods 
Two-sided 95% CI for the treatment group response rates are calculated using the Jeffreys method for 
the percentages in the efficacy summaries. No formal statistical comparisons between treatment 
groups will be performed. 
Results 
The majority of patients had cUTI (91.9%) and only 27/333 had cIAI. There were 332 treated of which 
322 completed treatment and 302 completed the TOC visit. The mean age was 63 years and >80% 
came from E. Europe. Among cUTI patients 45.2% had acute pyelonephritis. There were 25 CAZ-AVI 
(17.4%) and 24 BAT (17.5%) patients without a proven CAZ-R pathogen at baseline.  
Overall, 97% of BAT patients received a carbapenem, mostly imipenem or meropenem monotherapy. 
Six patients had baseline pathogens resistant to the BAT received (of which 4 or 5 were nevertheless 
cures). 
In both the mMITT and extended microbiologically evaluable (eME) analysis sets, CAZ-AVI generally 
achieved similar clinical cure rates to BAT at each visit. Comparable cure rates were observed at TOC. 
Table 30  
Clinical response at TOC (mMITT analysis set) 
Cure rates for pyelonephritis were 91.2% vs. 90% for BAT and for cUTI the rates were 92% vs. 
98.5%. The two clinical failures treated with CAZ-AVI did not have documented CAZ-AVI-R isolates at 
baseline or at time of failure.  
In the mMITT analysis set, the per-patient favourable microbiological response for cUTI patients at the 
TOC visit was higher in the CAZ-AVI group. A similar result was obtained in the eME population.

Table 31  
Per-patient microbiological response at TOC (mMITT analysis set) 
The per-pathogen favourable microbiological response rate at the TOC visit for the most common 
Gram-negative pathogens isolated from urine of cUTI patients was also higher in the CAZ-AVI group. 
The definition used for eradication of urinary pathogens was absence of causative pathogen or urine 
quantification <104 CFU/mL. Data using the EU definition of eradication (<103 CFU/mL) were not 
collected. However, the majority of patients with a favourable microbiological response at post-
baseline visits had urine specimens that showed no growth. 
Table 32  
Per patient microbiological response by visit REPRISE cUTI (mMITT analysis 
set) 
Four cUTI patients had E. coli that had CAZ-AVI MICs of 8 μg/mL and all were cures at TOC. One 
patient with K pneumoniae (MIC >256 μg/mL) and one with E. cloacae (MIC >256 μg/mL) were clinical 
cures as were two patients with P. aeruginosa for which MICs were 8 μg/mL. Nine other patients had P. 
aeruginosa isolates with CAZ-AVI MICs 16-256 μg/mL. Seven were clinical cures and the two had 
indeterminate responses. 
In the mMITT analysis set at TOC 17 cUTI patients (11.8%) in the CAZ-AVI group and 42 (30.7%) in 
the BAT group had persistence of the baseline species. At the FU1 visit, there were 29 (20.1%) vs. 50 
(36.5%) in respective groups with persistence, and 35 (24.3%) vs. 54 (39.4%) at the FU2 visit. A 
mixture of species accounted for these persisters. A post hoc manual review indicated that BAT 
patients with persistence appeared to be dosed appropriately and the duration of exposure to study 
treatment was similar between treatment groups. The majority of baseline MIC values for the relevant 
BAT were in the susceptible range with the exception of 7 cUTI patients, of which one had an 
unfavourable microbiological response from the EOT visit, 3 had an unfavourable microbiological 
response from the TOC visit onwards and one at the FU2 visit. In the mMITT analysis set, there were 
19 cUTI patients in the CAZ-AVI group and 18 cUTI patients in the BAT group with MRIB, of which 
17/19 and 16/18 were clinical cures at the TOC visit while 14 and 13, respectively, had a favourable 
microbiological response. All nine and four with baseline CrCL of 16 to 30 mL/min or 6 to 15 mL/min 
were clinical cures at TOC.

Study title: 
A Phase III, Randomized, Multicenter, Double-Blind, Double-Dummy, Parallel-Group, 
Comparative Study to Determine the Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability of Ceftazidime-
Avibactam Versus Doripenem Followed by Appropriate Oral Therapy in the Treatment of 
Complicated Urinary Tract Infections, Including Acute Pyelonephritis, With a Gram-Negative 
Pathogen in Hospitalized Adults (D4280C0002/0004, RECAPTURE) 
This was a Phase 3, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy study that compared CAZ-AVI vs. 
doripenem (500 mg q8h) for treatment of cUTI, with a switch to oral ciprofloxacin (500 mg BID; if Cip-
R, SMX-TMP could be used) allowed after at least 5 days IV (total 10-14 days IV/PO). 
Randomisation was stratified by type of infection (acute pyelonephritis or other cUTIs without 
pyelonephritis) and region (North America and Western Europe, Eastern Europe and ROW). The 
primary analysis was based on microbiological response (FDA definition) at TOC (21-25 days after 
randomisation). The pre-defined NI margin was -12.5% but analysis was repeated using -10% and 
also using the EU criterion for eradication (<103 CFU/mL). The sample size calculation gave 90% 
power to address the EU-recommended primary analysis. 
There were 1020 randomised and treated (IV) patients of which 588 also received oral treatment and 
944 completed the recommended treatment.  
Patient and disease characteristics were well balanced between treatment arms. The mean age was 
52.4 years, with 143 aged 65-74 and 117 aged ≥75 years. Most (90%) had normal renal function or 
mild impairment. Baseline microbiology showed the expected predominance of E. coli (in 73.8% of 
patients). 
Overall 810 were included in the mMITT set (207 did not have a qualifying culture) and 603 were 
eligible for the eME set. Overall in the mMITT population 72% had pyelonephritis, of which 503 had no 
complicating factors, and 28% had cUTI.   
Non-inferiority (based on 10% NI margin) of CAZ-AVI vs. doripenem was demonstrated for rates of 
microbiological response (at < 104 cfu/mL) and symptomatic response at TOC. For microbiological 
responses the lower bound of the 95% CI was above zero. The same finding applied after adjusting the 
microbiological response rates for stratification factors. The per-patient microbiological responses at 
the end of intravenous therapy (EOT [IV]) visit were 95.2% for CAZ-AVI vs. 94.7% for doripenem. 
Microbiological responses at TOC also favoured CAZ-AVI in the ME and eME sets. 
The subgroup analyses of microbiological responses at TOC in the mMITT population favoured CAZ-AVI 
except in the subset aged >74 years and in those with MRIB.

When the EU criterion (<103 CFU/mL) was applied there was still numerical superiority for CAZ-AVI 
and the lower bound of the 95% CI just exceeded zero.

The per-pathogen microbiological eradication rates were generally comparable between treatments for 
common pathogens, including E cloacae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis and P. aeruginosa.  
CAZ-R Gram-negative pathogens were found in 75 CAZ-AVI and 84 doripenem mMITT patients. The 
favourable per-patient microbiological response rates at TOC for this subset were 47 [62.7%] and 51 
[60.7%] in respective groups. At LFU the corresponding rates were 46 [61.3%] and 38 [45.2%]. 
The apparent numerically superior responses to CAZ-AVI vs. doripenem did not reflect baseline 
resistance to doripenem. In the mMITT analysis set, for all Enterobacteriaceae isolates (n=772) the 
doripenem MIC range was ≤0.008 μg/mL to >16 μg/mL with MIC90 0.06 μg/mL. Four isolates (2 from 
each treatment) had MICs ≥2 μg/mL (1 K. oxytoca; 3 K. pneumoniae) but all other isolates had 
doripenem MICs ≤1 μg/mL. For 38 P. aeruginosa isolates the doripenem MIC range was 0.06 μg/mL to 
>16 μg/mL with an MIC90 of 16 μg/mL while 13 (8 CAZ-AVI group, 5 doripenem group) had MICs ≥4 
μg/mL and all others were susceptible (MIC ≤2 μg/mL). Pathogens (27) resistant to one or both study 
drugs were excluded from the ME analysis but CAZ-AVI was still numerically superior to doripenem for 
per patient microbiological responses at TOC.  
Supportive studies 
Study NXL104 –2001 (cUTI) was a Phase 2, multi-center, investigator-blinded, randomized, two 
arm, parallel group (1:1) study to estimate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of CAZ-AVI. A total of 
137 patients received CAZ-AVI (500 mg CAZ /125 mg AVI 30 min IV infusion, q8h) vs. imipenem 
cilastatin (500 mg, 30 min IV infusion, q6h) in the treatment of adults with cUTI. After at least 4 days 
of IV therapy, patients with clinical improvement were permitted to switch to oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg 
every 12 hours to complete the treatment course. Patients were to receive 7-14 days of total antibiotic 
therapy (IV plus oral therapy). Approximately two-thirds of the patients enrolled in either treatment 
group had acute pyelonephritis. The study was not statistically powered to demonstrate non-inferiority 
to comparator. 
Similar favourable microbiological response rates were seen in both treatment groups in the ME 
population at TOC (primary endpoint); 19/27 (70.4%) in the CAZ-AVI group and 25/35 (71.4%) in the 
Assessment report

imipenem group. Similar favourable response rates were also seen across treatment arms at the end 
of IV therapy and at the late follow up.  
Study NXL104 –2002 (cIAI) was a Phase 2, multi-center, double-blind, randomized study to 
evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of CAZ-AVI (500 mg/2 g IV over 30 min every 8 hours) 
plus metronidazole (500 mg IV over 1 hr every 8 hours) vs. meropenem (1 g IV over 30 min every 8 
hours) for 5-14 days in adults with cIAI. A total of 102 patients were randomized into each treatment 
group. About half the patients in either treatment arm were enrolled with appendicitis. Race, gender, 
age, Apache II score (> 80% in each group had score ≤ 10), and BMI were generally similar across the 
treatment groups. E. coli was the most common pathogen isolated from the intra-abdominal site of 
infection in 73% of the patients across treatment groups. The study was not statistically powered to 
demonstrate non-inferiority to comparator. 
Similar favourable clinical response rates in the ME population at TOC (primary endpoint) were seen in 
both treatment groups; 62/68 (91.2%) in the CAZ-AVI group and 71/76 (93.4%) in the meropenem 
group (observed difference [CAZ-AVI – meropenem] -2.2%, 95% confidence interval [-
20.4%.12.2%]). The response rates were also similar at the discontinuation of IV therapy and Late 
Follow-up. In the APACHE II score category of 6-10 the cure rates were higher in the meropenem 
group (21/23, 91.3% vs. 17/21, 81% in the CAZ-AVI group). However, generally similar favourable 
response rates were seen in both treatment groups in each of these subgroup analyses. 
In the ME population, 43 patients (26 in CAZ-AVI group and 17 in meropenem group, including 1 
patient who had 2 baseline resistant pathogens) had baseline Gram negative pathogens that were 
resistant to CAZ alone. Favourable responses were seen for 25 of the 26 CAZ-R pathogens in the CAZ-
AVI group, a response rate similar to that seen in the meropenem group (17/18 pathogens). 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
For this FDC that combines a new beta-lactamase inhibitor with an approved beta-lactam, with which 
there is no PK interaction, the critical issue to support all the indications is to substantiate that the 
dose of AVI is sufficient to protect CAZ from hydrolysis by beta-lactamases proposed to be within the 
range of inhibition of AVI. The PTA analyses support 2 g/0.5 g q8h using 2 h infusions to treat each of 
cIAI, cUTI and NP. In addition, the applicant’s revised dose adjustments for renal impairment are 
predicted to improve the PTA compared those applied during the reported Phase 3 studies, in which it 
seems that some moderate renal impairment at baseline (MRIB) patients may have been temporarily 
under-dosed. 
Indication for use in patients with limited therapeutic options 
This is supported by the microbiological data. Due to the ability of AVI to inhibit serine 
carbapenemases as well as a wide range of ESBLs and AmpC enzymes it is clear that the combination 
has potential utility for treatment of aerobic Gram-negative pathogens within the spectrum of CAZ. 
There are some clinical data already available to support clinical activity in two indications (cIAI and 
cUTI) against CAZ-R organisms that express a range of beta-lactamases although it should be noted 
there have been very few patients treated with CAZ-AVI who were infected with organisms expressing 
serine carbapenemases.  
Standard indications claimed (cIAI, cUTI and NP) 
As a result of an Article 30 harmonisation referral procedure, CAZ alone has (amongst others) the 
following indications for treatment:  
• Nosocomial pneumonia  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/377887/2016  
Page 95/120 
 
 
 
 
 
• Complicated urinary tract infections  
• Complicated intra-abdominal infections  
Treatment of patients with bacteraemia that occurs in association with, or is suspected to be 
associated with, any of the infections listed above. 
These indications are supported by the available data on CAZ, including the scientific literature include 
in this application. 
The highest intermittent dose regimen for CAZ to treat all indications (except for CF) is 2 g q8h, which 
is the dose used in the CAZ-AVI FDC. The duration of infusion for CAZ alone is not specified, whereas 2 
h is used for CAZ-AVI as a result of the PK-PD analyses. Since the adequacy of the dose of AVI is the 
critical issue for this application the following comments are made on each of the three standard 
indications currently sought: 
Nosocomial pneumonia 
There are no clinical efficacy data with CAZ-AVI in NP patients. The updated PTA analyses have 
included more extensive PK data from patients in REPROVE and have substantiated the adequacy of 
the plasma exposures, including for patients with ARC. The ELF data are supportive but it is not 
possible to place undue reliance of the analyses using these data. Although the available data on CAZ 
alone demonstrate efficacy in in the NP indication, it has some limitations, as previously highlighted in 
the Article 30 procedure. Therefore, although there seems to be sufficient evidence to allow an 
indication for NP it is essential that the SmPC adequately reflects the basis for this usage. Since the 
efficacy assessment in NP patients is primarily based on PK-PD analysis (complemented by clinical data 
on CAZ alone and on CAZ-AVI in other infections, as well as PK data from HAP patients), it is 
considered necessary to verify the impact on CAZ-AVI use on clinical outcomes, in order to confirm the 
efficacy assumptions. Therefore, provision of the full CSR from REPROVE, a post-authorisation efficacy 
study, is included as a condition in Annex II to the marketing authorisation. 
cIAI 
Although the initial Phase 2 study (NXL104/2002) suggested very high cure rates with CAZ-AVI 2 g/ 
0.5 g q8h using 30 min infusions, analyses of the sparse sampling data suggested that 2 h infusions 
would provide more reliable cover for organisms with MICs at the upper end of desired range (8 mg/L). 
Therefore 2 h infusions were used in the Phase 3 studies RECLAIM and RECLAIM3. 
RECLAIM was of adequate design and conduct and nearly 80% had at least one valid pathogen but the 
baseline APACHE scores were mostly low. The study met its pre-defined primary endpoint for 
demonstration of non-inferiority in compliance with CHMP and FDA requirements but CAZ-AVI (plus 
metronidazole for anaerobic cover) showed almost consistent numerical inferiority to meropenem in 
each pre-defined analysis population and patient subgroup.  
Further analyses investigated the possible reasons for the lower cure rates especially in the MRIB 
population and those with APACHE II scores. It seems that the differences were mostly driven by the 
cure rates in the MRIB group since removal of these patients from the analyses removed or lessened 
the differences between treatments. In the MRIB group the cure rates in the MITT and mMITT analysis 
sets were 48.8% and 45.2% for CAZ-AVI vs. 74.4% and 74.3%, respectively, for meropenem. CAZ 
and AVI plasma exposures on Day 3 were similar for 35 CAZ-AVI patients with CrCL >30 to ≤50 
mL/min vs. those with CrCL > 50 mL/min at baseline. Although day 3 plasma levels suggested 
appropriate dose adjustment, the patients on CAZ-AVI with rapid recovery in CrCL were more likely to 
have been temporarily under-dosed than similar patients on meropenem based on the greater % 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/377887/2016  
Page 96/120 
 
 
 
 
 
reduction in recommended dose for the former vs. latter. This is a plausible explanation but there are 
no PK data to substantiate this claim.  
It is of further concern that MITT patients with MRIB at baseline (n=84; 41 CAZ-AVI) predominated 
among the 21 total deaths such that 8/13 CAZ-AVI and 3/8 meropenem deaths involved such patients. 
Also, among the 9 deaths that were considered to be due to disease progression 5/6 in the CAZ-AVI 
group and 1/3 in the meropenem group were patients with MRIB.    
While the observed differences between CAZ-AVI and meropenem in the MRIB sub-population are of 
concern the previous section has described the applicant’s revisions of the dose adjustment schema in 
an attempt to reduce the risk of potential under-dosing. The dose for moderate renal impairment is 
increased from q12h to q8h and there are other adjustments to doses for lower CrCL. Nevertheless, 
the impact of the treatment responses in the MRIB group on the overall study cure rates should be 
stated in the SmPC. 
The second cIAI study (RECLAIM3) had even fewer patients with high APACHE II scores and MRIB. This 
study generally showed very comparable cure rates between CAZ-AVI and meropenem and there was 
no numerical inferiority for CAZ-AVI in the small MRIB sub-group although there was in the sub-group 
with the highest APACHE II scores. This study supports the results of RECLAIM. 
In general RECLAIM3 supports the findings of RECLAIM. However, the results in the mMITT population 
infected with enterobacterial species are somewhat anomalous and should be explored.  
Overall, taking into account the revised dose adjustment schema, the data are considered sufficient to 
support an indication for cIAI but the MRIB results and the limitations of the patient population treated 
(including the low APACHE II scores, should be reported in section 4.4 of the SmPC). 
cUTI 
Since both CAZ and AVI are mainly excreted unchanged in urine it is expected that very high 
concentrations are reached in urine, which is important for cUTI. For acute pyelonephritis the tissue 
concentrations are also important but there are no specific concerns from available data regarding 
treatment of this subset with the same predicted dose as for cUTI.  
In support of this indication there are clinical efficacy data from RECAPTURE, in which at least 5 days 
IV was required before oral switch, and from REPRISE in infections due to CAZ-R pathogens. Nearly 
half of patients in REPRISE and 72% in RECAPTURE had acute pyelonephritis but the response rates 
were generally similar to those for the cUTI population. 
Although neither study pre-defined a primary endpoint as recommended by CHMP the data from 
RECAPTURE could be analysed accordingly and were reassuring regarding the comparative efficacy of 
CAZ-AVI vs. doripenem. The data from REPRISE were reported for <104 CFU/mL and for no growth and 
suggested that CAZ-AVI was at least as efficacious as BAT (noting that this study was not powered for 
formal inferential testing). REPRISE also provided a substantial body of evidence supporting the CAZ-
AVI dose for treatment of CAZ-R pathogens although, due to high drug concentrations predicted in the 
urinary tract, it cannot necessarily be assumed that the same level of efficacy will be exerted at other 
sites. It should also be noted that very few pathogens expressing serine carbapenemases have been 
treated with CAZ-AVI. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Taking into the information already available on the efficacy of CAZ, the clinical efficacy data for CAZ-
AVI in cUTI and cIAI, including CAZ-R pathogens, and the PK-PD analyses that support the dose

adjustment schema and the application of the same posology to NP patients, the applicant’s proposed 
indications are acceptable. 
CHMP noted that the various limitations of the data are adequately reflected in the Zavicefta SmPC and 
agreed that the proposed indications were acceptable. The Applicant is requested to submit the final 
clinical study report for REPROVE as an annex II condition. The submission of the CSRs from the two 
ongoing paediatric studies was also requested by CHMP. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The applicant’s initial analysis of safety was based on the following datasets: 
o  Phase 1 pool: 11 Phase 1 CAZ-AVI or AVI-only studies that enrolled healthy volunteers or 
special populations and the AVI-only cohort from CXL PK-01 
o  cIAI pool (referred to as DBC):  Phase 2 study (2002) and Phase 3 study (RECLAIM), which 
used the same CAZ-AVI standard dose regimen (2 g/0.5 g q8h) but different infusion times (30 
min in Phase 2 and 2 h in Phase 3)  
o  Phase 2 cUTI study (2001), which used a lower dose of 0.5 g/0.125 g q8h 
Patient exposure 
The initial analyses focussed on the DBC cIAI pool, in which 630 patients received CAZ-AVI plus 
metronidazole and 631 received meropenem. The mean and median durations of exposure were ~ 8 
days and 72% vs. 76% in respective treatment groups received 5-10 days. 
During the procedure full CSRs were provided from RECLAIM3, RECAPTURE and REPRISE. The 
new/updated safety analysis sets added 890 CAZ-AVI patients to give a total of 1672 patients. The 
main safety features of these studies reported during the procedure are described separately below. 
However, integrated data are also described under some headings to provide a more complete picture 
(e.g. deaths). 
Adverse events 
In the DBC cIAI pool the incidences of AEs and other major features of the safety profile up to the last 
study visit were slightly higher for CAZ-AVI (with metronidazole) vs. meropenem. 
Table 34 
Adverse events up to last visit in any category –DBC cIAI pool (safety analysis 
set)

The differences in rates of the most common (≥ 2%) AEs were considered to reflect the known profiles 
of CAZ and metronidazole, including the higher rates of gastro-intestinal system AEs for CAZ-AVI. 
There were only 3 CAZ-AVI and 7 meropenem patients with infusion site reactions.  
The majority of AEs were mild or moderate in intensity (severe AEs were reported by 5.4% CAZ-AVI 
and 7% meropenem patients). Four CAZ-AVI but no meropenem patients had severe acute renal 
failure, which were all SAEs (see further below). Also, 5 CAZ-AVI patients but no meropenem patients 
had 6 severe AEs relating to perforations (duodenal, ileal, gastric, intestinal, large intestine and small 
intestine), of which four were SAEs. The SRP determined there was inadequate source control for 3 
patients with 4 perforations. 
Treatment-related AEs were reported for 7.9% CAZ-AVI and 6.8% meropenem patients. The most 
common in respective groups were diarrhoea (1.7% and 0.5%), increased ALT (1.0% for both), 
increased AST (1.0% for both) and nausea (1.0% and 0.6%). 
Table 35

Liver disorders 
In the DBC cIAI pool, liver disorder AEs occurred in 3.3% CAZ-AVI and 3.6% meropenem patients, 
mainly reflecting increased ALT (1.9% and 2.5%) and AST (2.1% and 2.7%). One CAZ-AVI patient had 
SAEs of increased hepatic enzymes and localized intra-abdominal fluid collection and discontinued. PCS

ALT results were reported for 3.7% vs. 4.9% and PCS AST in 4.4% vs. 3.3% while 10 CAZ-AVI vs. 9 
meropenem patients had ALT or AST ≥ 3 × ULN and TBL ≥ 2 × ULN but all had non-drug-related 
explanations for these results.  
Diarrhoea 
In the cIAI DBC pool one CAZ-AVI patient discontinued study drug due to non-serious diarrhoea. One 
patient in each treatment group had AEs of C. difficile colitis, which were both toxin-positive but were 
non-serious and moderate in intensity.  
Hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis 
No AEs of anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis or erythema multiforme 
have occurred thus far. In the DBC cIAI pool rates of hypersensitivity AEs were 4.1% for CAZ-AVI vs. 
2.7% for meropenem, most of which concerned rash (2.9% vs. 2.1%). Two CAZ-AVI patients had 
rashes that resulted in study discontinuation. One had a pruritic rash on day 12 accompanied by 
abnormal LFTs and the rash resolved after discontinuation. The other had a macular rash starting on 
day 5, which resolved after discontinuation. One other CAZ-AVI patient had a SAE of hypersensitivity 
and study drug was discontinued. PCS elevated eosinophils occurred in 2 CAZ-AVI and 1 meropenem 
patient at any time before their last visit, one of whom also had erythema and pruritus. Also, two 
patients had AEs of eosinophil count increased. 
Haematological disorders 
In the DBO cIAI pool 3.8% CAZ-AVI vs. 4.4% meropenem patients had any haematological AE. One 
CAZ-AVI patient had a non-serious AE of low WBC but did not discontinue. Rates for individual 
abnormalities were generally balanced between treatments and there were no remarkable findings in 
CAZ-AVI patients in other studies. The Coombs seroconversion rates for those with data (local labs 
only) were 11.5% (37/322) for CAZ-AVI and 2.8% (9/319) for meropenem patients. Ten CAZ-AVI 
patients who had a positive Coombs test result at EOT reverted to a negative Coombs test result at 
some point up to the last visit. No patients had an AE of haemolytic anaemia during the study and 
hyperbilirubinaemia was observed at very low rates for both treatments.  
Renal disorders 
In the DBO cIAI pool renal disorder AEs were reported for 18 (2.9%) CAZ-AVI and 10 (1.6%) 
meropenem patients. Taking into account data from the studies reported during the procedure there 
were 57 subjects/patients (5 AVI, 29 CAZ-AVI +/- MTZ and 23 comparator) who had AEs identified as 
part of the search strategy used for the Renal disorder Safety Topics of Interest and/or met PCS 
elevations in creatinine (>2.0 × ULN and >100% increase from baseline). This group was stratified 
according to 3 categories of AKI likelihood, suggesting that 25/57 either had no clear laboratory 
evidence of AKI or had pre-existing renal impairment/were on HD, which confounded interpretation of 
the findings. Of the remaining 32 patients (19 CAZ-AVI): 
o  9 (3 CAZ-AVI) had PCS elevations in creatinine without any reported AEs.  
o  23 (16 CAZ-AVI) had AEs reported and creatinine clearance trends indicative of renal 
dysfunction.  
There were 22/32 with normal renal function or mild renal impairment at baseline. Rates of PCS 
creatinine increases and renal disorder AEs were balanced (11 CAZ-AVI vs. 11 comparator patients). 
However, 9/11 CAZ-AVI  and 8/11 comparator patients had an alternative aetiology explaining the 
renal dysfunction or had other factors that confounded assessment of AKI and/or the AEs were 
reported with a timeline that did not make it plausibly indicative of treatment-related AKI. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/377887/2016  
Page 100/120 
 
 
 
 
 
remaining 10/32 had MRIB or SRIB and showed an imbalance in cases with 8 CAZ-AVI (4 from 
RECLAIM) vs. 2 comparator patients. Seven of the 8 CAZ-AVI patients had an alternative aetiology for 
renal dysfunction or other factors that confounded assessment of AKI and/or the AEs were reported 
with a timeline that did not make it plausibly indicative of AKI due to CAZ-AVI. Six received furosemide 
and/or aminoglycosides. The two comparator arm patients received concomitant medications that have 
the potential to cause AKI. 
The BUN and creatinine shift and PCS tables for the entire Phase 2 and Phase 3 pool were analysed to 
assess whether CAZ-AVI may be associated with a higher risk of nephrotoxicity than the comparators. 
There were very few instances of major shifts/PCS results in either the pooled CAZ-AVI or comparator 
groups and no signal for an excess in the CAZ-AVI patients. These findings applied to patients with 
CrCL >50 mL/min or ≤50 mL/min at baseline, for which separate tabulations were provided. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events 
In the DBC cIAI pool 8.1% of patients in each treatment group had an SAE up to their last visit. The 
most common SAEs by PT in the CAZ-AVI group were acute renal failure, pulmonary embolism and 
respiratory failure. Two SAEs per treatment group were assessed as drug-related, including 
hypersensitivity (45 minutes into infusion on Day 3 with rash, dyspnoea and sweating) and hepatic 
enzymes increased (on Days 7-10 that recovered post-treatment) in CAZ-AVI patients and drug 
eruption and transaminases increased in meropenem patients. Three of the 6 CAZ-AVI patients with 
acute renal failure SAEs died (see below).

Deaths 
In the initial safety analysis there were 31 deaths across all clinical studies, including 18 in CAZ-AVI 
patients. Two of the 18 CAZ-AVI patients died after the last visit so were removed from the total. Most 
(26/31) deaths occurred in the DBO cIAI pool (i.e. 16 CAZ-AVI and 10 meropenem; 13 vs. 8 in 
RECLAIM) and occurred after Day 7 (10/16 CAZ-AVI and 7/10 meropenem).  After pooling all the data 
with the studies reported during the procedure the total is 37 deaths (21 CAZ-AVI), giving rates of 
1.3% for CAZ-AVI vs. 1.0% for pooled comparators. 
When shown by indication there remained an imbalance in rates for cIAI patients (2.1% vs. 1.4%). 
Most deaths occurred before days 14-21 on study. There were slightly more deaths that occurred after 
day 21 with CAZ-AVI in Phase 3 studies.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/377887/2016  
Page 102/120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Deaths in patients with normal renal function or mild impairment included 6 patients per treatment 
group with AEs with outcome of death and 2 CAZ-AVI vs. 4 comparator patients in whom death was 
considered to be due to disease progression. In the MRIB/SRIB group 6 CAZ-AVI and 5 comparator 
patients had AEs with outcome of death but deaths due to disease progression occurred in 7 vs. 1 in 
respective treatment groups. It was not possible to ascribe the numerical imbalance of deaths due to 
disease progression to under-dosing when using the prior dose adjustment schema except for one 
patient. Further assessment by an independent reviewer suggested that there were three patients (one 
CAZ-AVI) for whom it cannot be ruled out that lack of efficacy contributed to death. 
Thirty patients who died had cIAI and had APACHE II scores from 5 to 27 with a median of 12. 
Baseline APACHE II scores for the patients who died were higher than median baseline APACHE II 
scores across cIAI CAZ-AVI studies. This finding applied in both treatment groups. 
Laboratory findings 
In the DBC cIAI pool the haematology findings were either expected based on experience with CAZ 
(e.g. thrombocytosis in 5.2% CAZ-AVI patients) or balanced between treatments (e.g. leucocytosis in 
3.0% CAZ-AVI vs. 3.1% meropenem patients). The most common PCS findings included decreased 
haemoglobin (7.2% vs. 8.2%) and decreased erythrocyte volume fraction (7.2% vs. 9.8%) in 
respective groups. PCS INR and PT values were higher for the CAZ-AVI group, thought to be due to 
metronidazole which can potentiate warfarin-type oral anticoagulants. The mean chemistry values and 
shifts over time were similar between treatment groups and there were no trends or safety concerns 
for CAZ-AVI. 
Safety in special populations 
After pooling data with those from studies reported during the procedure for 369 (185 CAZ-AVI) 
patients aged ≥75 years there was no evidence of an overall increased risk of AEs vs. comparators.  
Table 37 
Adverse events up to the last visit for elderly patients ≥75 years of age 
(safety analysis set) 
The most frequently reported AEs (≥2%) in the CAZ-AVI group were nausea, (4.3%) and AF (3.2%). 
The rates were 2.7% for each of constipation, diarrhoea, headache, hypertension, oedema peripheral 
and wound infection and 2.2% for insomnia and anaemia (2.2% each). The number of patients with 
renal failure events (renal failure, renal failure acute and renal impairment) were balanced (5 CAZ-AVI 
and 4 comparators). The analysis for 145 cIAI patients aged ≥75 years (61 CAZ-AVI) also showed 
similar total AE rates (63.9% vs. 66.7%). In each of the abovementioned SOCs the rates were lower in 
the CAZ-AVI group except for renal and urinary disorders (5 [8.2%] CAZ-AVI and 5 [6.0%] for 
comparators).

The incidence of any AE was slightly higher in the CAZ-AVI group for female patients. This was largely 
driven by a cumulative effect of slightly higher rates for women than men in each SOC.  
The highest BMI subgroup (≥ 30 kg/m2) had slightly higher rates for AEs with an outcome of death, 
SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation and severe AEs in the CAZ-AVI group, mainly reflecting rates of 
psychiatric disorders, nervous system disorders, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders and Injury, 
poisoning and procedural complications. Most Candida infections were in the highest BMI subgroup. 
There was an increased incidence in all categories of AEs with declining renal status that was generally 
higher in the CAZ-AVI group. Using the updated safety database, the applicant provided the following 
table of SAEs in MRIB patients.

As shown above, the updated rates of MRIB patients with at least one SAE were CAZ-AVI 17.4% vs. 
comparator 11.8%. Rates of SAEs were balanced across treatment groups except for renal and urinary 
disorders (see above).  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the DBC cIAI pool 3.0% CAZ-AVI and 1.6% meropenem patients discontinued study drug due to 
AEs. For 6 CAZ-AVI and 4 meropenem patients the AEs were assessed by the investigator as causally 
related to study drug. In the CAZ-AVI group these AEs were diarrhoea, drug eruption, hepatic enzyme 
increased, headache, hypersensitivity, rash macular and rash pruritic. 
Additional safety data from REPRISE 
In patients with cUTI, the median total days on treatment was 10 days for CAZ-AVI and BAT with 
~37% receiving > 10 days. All but 4 patients received the recommended treatment duration of 5 to 21 
days. The incidence of AEs, including AEs with a fatal outcome, SAEs and AEs leading to 
discontinuation of study treatment was low and similar between treatment groups. There were 3 
deaths in each treatment group for cUTI patients, and 1 cIAI patient died in the BAT group. All 7 
patients had an AE with an outcome of death that was not considered related to study treatment by 
the investigator; no deaths were due to disease progression.  
Table 39 
Adverse events up to EOT visit in any category (safety analysis set) 
Up to the EOT visit, the incidence of AEs reported across treatment groups by SOC in cUTI patients 
was generally balanced, with the exception of Nervous system disorders and Gastrointestinal disorders

for which the incidence of AEs was higher in the BAT group (3.3% vs. 7.2% and 5.9% vs. 14.4%, 
respectively).  Diarrhoea and headache also occurred more often with BAT. In the CAZ-AVI group, the 
number of AEs occurring in ≥2% of cUTI patients was low and included nausea and pyrexia. Overall, 
the majority of AEs were mild or moderate in intensity. The table below shows AEs up to LFU. 
Table 40 
Adverse events up to LFU visit by system organ class and by preferred term 
(≥2% of cUTI-cIAI patients for CAZ-AVI or ≥2% cUTI patients in any 
treatment group) (safety analysis set)  
The incidence of AEs considered to be causally related to study treatment by the investigator in cUTI 
patients up to the EOT visit was low and balanced across treatment groups (3.9% vs. 5.9% BAT). 
In the initial dossier the overall (cUTI and cIAI combined) Coombs seroconversion rate up to the LFU 
visit was 19.4% (14/72 tested) in the CAZ-AVI group vs. 2.7% (2/73) in the BAT group. However, the 
rate computed after submission of further study reports (see below) during the procedure was 82/762 
(10.8%). This is still higher than reported in the ceftazidime SmPC, in which it is stated that The 
development of a positive Coombs test associated with the use of ceftazidime in about 5% of patients 
may interfere with the cross-matching of blood. There were no events or laboratory findings of 
haemolytic anaemia in the 82 patients who had seroconversion across the clinical studies. The rates 
obtained are subject to a large amount of missing data and an unknown bias effect. 
No new safety concerns were identified from the Safety Topics of Interest. The frequency of PCS 
changes in clinical laboratory tests was low and balanced across treatment groups. There were no Hy's 
Law cases. No new safety concerns were identified for any of the clinical laboratory, ECG, physical 
examination and vital signs assessments. 
Additional safety data from RECLAIM 3 
The median duration of exposure was 6 days in both treatment groups and > 90% received 5 to 14 
days. The overall frequency and pattern of AEs were comparable between the treatment groups and 
almost all were mild or moderate in severity.

The commonest AEs are shown below. AEs considered by the investigator to be drug-related and 
reported for >1 CAZ-AVI patient up to LFU were nausea (5 [2.3%]) and diarrhoea (3 [1.4%]). There 
was no excess of AESIs in the CAZ-AVI group.

Two deaths in the CAZ-AVI group were due to disease progression and one meropenem patient had an

Coombs test shifts from negative to positive up to the LFU visit occurred in 20.8% CAZ-AVI patients 
vs. 2.9% meropenem patients. There was a high proportion of missing data (~ 67.4%) and all data 
were from local laboratories. No AE or laboratory evidence of haemolysis was identified.

The median duration of exposure to IV therapy was 7 days for CAZ-AVI and 8 days for doripenem. 
More than half of patients switched to oral therapy. During IV therapy the AE rates were low and 
comparable. 
  Table 44

The AE rate was higher in the CAZ-AVI group up to the LFU visit (36.2% vs. 31%) but most AEs 
throughout the study were of mild or moderate intensity. During IV therapy the commonest AEs were 
as shown below.

The rates of SAEs were low and there were no deaths in the study. There were 7 CAZ-AVI and 6 
doripenem patients who discontinued assigned treatment due to AEs, including 2 in the CAZ-AVI group 
who had diarrhoea. Seroconversion rates for the Coombs test up to the LFU visit occurred in 3.2% in 
the CAZ-AVI group vs. 0.9% in the doripenem group. There was a high proportion of missing data 
(~58%) and all data were from local laboratories. 
Post marketing experience 
Avycaz (ceftazidime-avibactam) was approved in the US on 25 February 2015 and launched 23 April 
2015. No AEs associated with Avycaz were reported from 25 February 2015 to 24 May 2015 and one 
patient with two AEs associated with Avycaz was reported from 25 May 2015 to 24 August 2015. These 
AEs were thrombocytopenia and Off-label use for treatment of carbapenem-resistant 
Enterobacteriaceae in the blood and sputum of a 59-year-old male. Treatment was discontinued due to 
the thrombocytopenia. No laboratory values were reported. Both AEs were non-serious. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Thus far, the safety profile of CAZ-AVI has generally reflected that already known for CAZ alone. 
Nevertheless, although the safety database is considered to be adequate in size, it is not possible to 
draw any definitive conclusions regarding the possible effects of AVI on the ADR profile of CAZ. In 
addition, since the dose used in CAZ-AVI is the highest intermittent dose recommended for non-CF 
patients whereas the ADR frequencies reported for CAZ alone reflect broader usage, it is not 
appropriate to compare frequencies between CAZ-AVI and those of CAZ. Other constraints for 
interpretation of the data include the fact that reasonable comparisons of safety are possible only vs. 
carbapenems and only in patients with cIAI or cUTI. Hence it is not really so surprising that rates of 
some AEs more associated with cephalosporins than carbapenems are higher with CAZ-AVI. What is 
more, all CAZ-AVI patients with cIAI also received metronidazole, which confounds the comparisons 
made.  
It is appropriate that the CAZ-AVI SmPC should include warnings pertaining to hypersensitivity, 
antibacterial agent-associated colitis and pseudo-membranous colitis due to Clostridium difficile, 
concurrent treatment with nephrotoxic medicinal products and development of a positive Coombs' test 
(although this is stated to occur in ~5% of patients, which under-estimates the observed rate in CAZ-
AVI studies; see below). However, it is considered important that the list of ADRs in section 4.8 and 
their frequencies should be driven by the safety data from the CAZ-AVI Phase 2/3 studies. Additional 
data provided during the CHMP review were not available at the time the US FDA approved this FDC. 
Therefore it is not necessarily appropriate to propose the exact same table of ADRs as was approved in 
the US. After updating of the safety data during the procedure there was only a small imbalance in 
death rates for CAZ-AVI vs. pooled comparators across indications (37 deaths [21 CAZ-AVI], giving 
rates of 1.3% for CAZ-AVI vs. 1.0% for pooled comparators). When shown by indication there was a 
greater imbalance in rates for cIAI patients (18 [2.1%] vs. 12 [1.4%]). This number included 2 CAZ-
AVI (both ascribed to disease progression) and 1 meropenem death in RECLAIM3. There were no 
deaths in RECAPTURE (all cUTI) and very few deaths in REPRISE (mostly UTI), with no imbalance. 
In the cIAI patients most deaths occurred before days 14-21 on study. Further exploration of the 
deaths revealed that in the MRIB/SRIB group 6 CAZ-AVI and 5 comparator patients had AEs with 
outcome of death but deaths due to disease progression occurred in 7 vs. 1 in respective treatment 
groups. It is not possible to ascribe or to rule out a contribution to the imbalance in deaths due to 
disease progression to temporary under-dosing. It can be observed that baseline APACHE II scores for 
the patients who died were higher than median baseline APACHE II scores across cIAI CAZ-AVI studies 
but this finding applied in both treatment groups. 
Overall, it remains possible that the remaining imbalance in deaths in cIAI patients occurred by chance 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/377887/2016  
Page 109/120 
 
 
 
 
 
and/or reflected at least in part dosing of MRIB patients in the initial phase of treatment and/or an 
imbalance in adequate surgical management. The imbalance should be reflected in the SmPC. 
Across all completed Phase 1 through Phase 3 studies of the CAZ-AVI programme there were 57 
subjects/patients (5 AVI, 29 CAZ-AVI +/- MTZ and 23 comparator) who had AEs identified as part of 
the search strategy used for the Renal disorder Safety Topics of Interest and/or met PCS elevations in 
creatinine (>2.0 × ULN and >100% increase from baseline). A detailed analysis of these patients and 
of all PCS values relating to renal function was undertaken. 
Of the 57 subjects/patients 37 could be verified as having laboratory evidence that supported the AEs 
reported. Another 5 had baseline renal dysfunction and findings that did not suggest a contribution 
from AVI. In the remaining 32 patients (19 CAZ-AVI) there were 22 (11 CAZ-AVI) with normal function 
or mild impairment and 10 with MRIB/SRIB (8 CAZ-AVI). However, the information available provided 
a more likely explanation than CAZ-AVI-related AKI for most cases. The shifts and PCS tables do not 
suggest an excess risk for CAZ-AVI over comparators. 
The SmPC contains the statements and AEs that are based on information available on CAZ, i.e. that 
CAZ can be associated with nephrotoxicity especially if combined with other nephrotoxic agents. It is 
not possible from available data to definitively conclude whether adding AVI increases the risk of AKI 
and whether the resulting rates of AKI exceed those observed with other commonly used antibacterial 
agents. The matter has been reflected in the RMP.  
There was an increased incidence in all categories of AEs with declining renal status. There were very 
few patients with SRIB. In the MRIB subgroup there were 6 CAZ-AVI patients with renal failure acute 
[3], renal failure [2] and renal impairment [1] but only one in the comparator group (renal 
impairment). These patients were investigated as described above. Other SOCs or PTs for which there 
was a higher reporting rate in the CAZ-AVI MRIB group were not indicative of AKI. In addition, in the 
MRIB population the only SOCs that showed higher rates for CAZ-AVI were cardiac disorders (12.9% 
vs. 8.3%), gastrointestinal disorders (22.7% vs. 14.6%; rates of diarrhoea were comparable between 
treatments), injury/poisoning/procedural complications (9.1% vs. 4.9%) and renal disorders (8.3% vs. 
4.2%).  
In Phase 3 studies (except for RECAPTURE), the Coombs seroconversion rate was very high and much 
higher than what is reported for CAZ. In each study the denominator is only a fraction of the total 
study population but it does seem to be consistent that rates are much higher than reported for CAZ 
alone. However, further exploration of the data did not suggest that the rates reflected an effect of 
AVI. Text was added to the SmPC but the actual rates per study vs. comparators must be stated 
because the mean rate reported by the applicant is much lowered by the unexplained and unusually 
low rate in RECAPTURE. It should also be remembered that the DAGT results all came from local labs. 
The applicant also explored in detail all cases of raised transaminases, including PK-PD analyses to 
ascertain whether exposure to CAZ and/or AVI was related to the increases observed. It appeared that 
AVI exposure was not a factor but there was a weak association with CAZ exposure. 
Overall the rates make these ADRs common, which is the same as in the CAZ SmPC. There have not 
been any cases that meet Hy’s Law criteria. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
CHMP agreed that the additional safety data generated by the recently completed comparative studies 
conducted in cIAI and cUTI added considerably to the database and have been mainly reassuring.

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Labelling exemptions 
A request to omit certain particulars from the labelling as per Art.63.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC has 
been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group for the following 
reasons: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/377887/2016  
Page 112/120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Although above the limit of 10ml (20 ml vial), the space available on the vial does not allow displaying 
the full particulars in a readable manner, in particular for the multilingual label. For that reason and 
because it is to be administered by a healthcare professional, the QRD Group accepted the request to 
have only the minimum particulars on the vial label. 
2.9.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Zavicefta (ceftazidime / avibactam) is 
included in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 
2011, was not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Zavicefta is a fixed-dose combination containing ceftazidime, an approved betalactam, and avibactam, 
a novel betalactamase inhibitor.  
Ceftazidime is a third generation cephalosporin with an antibacterial activity against Gram-negative 
aerobes, including P. aeruginosa, is already licensed for the proposed indications cIAI, cUTI and 
NP/HAP, and CHMP agreed that the available data on its safety and efficacy are adequate and 
sufficient. 
The inhibitory range of avibactam clearly exceeds that of tazobactam, clavulanic acid and sulbactam. 
In vitro data, including studies with CAZ-R organisms and enzyme inhibition studies, indicate a 
potential inhibition by avibactam of serine-based carbapenemases and of AmpC enzymes, as well as a 
wide range of ESBLs. The clinical efficacy data against CAZ-R pathogens support the in vitro findings 
although CHMP noted that numbers of pathogens treated expressing certain enzymes expected to be 
within the spectrum of inhibition of AVI was so far low.  
The selection of the PK-PD indices and identification of the individual and combined PD targets was 
accepted by CHMP. The final estimates of PTA at CAZ-AVI MIC 8 mg/L reflect the updated POPPK 
analysis that included the phase 3 sparse sampling data from infected patients who received the final 
proposed dose regimen. Essentially, CHMP agreed with the applicant’ conclusions regarding the 
sufficiency of the dose for cUTI and cIAI patients when MICs are up to 8 mg/L. The information 
available for CAZ efficacy in HAP and the additional PK data from HAP patients provide support for use 
of CAZ-AVI in this indication.  
During the procedure the applicant added three completed studies to the body of evidence. As a result 
there are two comparative studies vs. meropenem in cIAI and a study vs. doripenem in cUTI (with at 
least 5 days IV), which showed non-inferiority versus the comparator and support the recommended 
dose. A fourth study, REPRISE, conducted in patients with cIAI or cUTI due to CAZ-R pathogens, was 
not powered for inferential testing but it demonstrated numerically comparable efficacy for CAZ-AVI vs. 
BAT.

Indication for use in patients with limited therapeutic options 
Despite the fact that this indication is supported by the microbiological data, PK-PD analyses and 
clinical efficacy data in cIAI and cUTI, including efficacy against CAZ-R organisms that express a range 
of beta-lactamases, CHMP agreed that it is essential that the Zavicefta SmPC fully explains the basis 
for this indication and the lack of any clinical experience with CAZ-AVI for treating infections at other 
body sites.  
Hospital acquired pneumonia (nosocomial pneumonia) 
There are no clinical efficacy data with CAZ-AVI in HAP patients. The updated PTA analyses have 
included more extensive PK data from patients in REPROVE and have substantiated the adequacy of 
the plasma exposures, including for patients with ARC. The ELF data are supportive but it is not 
possible to place undue reliance of the analyses using these data. Although the available data on CAZ 
alone demonstrate efficacy in the NP indication, it has certain limitations as previously highlighted also 
in a referral (article 30) procedure. Therefore, although the currently available evidence seems 
sufficient to allow an indication for HAP, it is essential that the SmPC adequately reflects the basis for 
this usage. In order to verify the impact on CAZ-AVI use on clinical outcomes in HAP, provision of the 
full CSR from REPROVE is listed as an annex II condition. 
cIAI 
RECLAIM was of an adequate design and conduct and nearly 80% of the patients had at least one valid 
pathogen but the baseline APACHE scores were mostly low. The study met its pre-defined primary 
endpoint for demonstration of non-inferiority in compliance with CHMP (and FDA) requirements, but 
CAZ-AVI (plus metronidazole for anaerobic cover) showed almost consistent numerical inferiority to 
meropenem in each pre-defined analysis population and patient subgroup.  
Further analyses investigated the possible reasons for the lower cure rates, especially in the MRIB 
population and those with APACHE II scores. It seems that the differences were mostly driven by the 
cure rates in the MRIB group, since removal of these patients from the analyses removed or lessened 
the differences between treatments. In the MRIB group the cure rates in the MITT and mMITT analysis 
sets were 48.8% and 45.2% for CAZ-AVI vs. 74.4% and 74.3%, respectively, for meropenem. CAZ 
and AVI plasma exposures on Day 3 were similar for 35 CAZ-AVI patients with CrCL >30 to ≤50 
mL/min vs. those with CrCL > 50 mL/min at baseline. Although day 3 plasma levels suggested 
appropriate dose adjustment, the patients on CAZ-AVI with rapid recovery in CrCL were more likely to 
have been temporarily under-dosed than similar patients on meropenem based on the greater % 
reduction in recommended dose for the former vs. latter. CHMP agreed that this is a plausible 
explanation, but noted that there are no PK data to substantiate this claim.  
In addition, MITT patients with MRIB at baseline (n=84; 41 CAZ-AVI) predominated among the 21 
total deaths such that 8/13 CAZ-AVI and 3/8 meropenem deaths involved such patients. Also, among 
the 9 deaths that were considered to be due to disease progression 5/6 in the CAZ-AVI group and 1/3 
in the meropenem group were patients with MRIB.    
While the observed differences between CAZ-AVI and meropenem in the MRIB sub-population are of 
concern the applicant has since revised the dose adjustment schema in an attempt to reduce the risk 
of potential under-dosing. Nevertheless, CHMP requested that the impact of the treatment responses in 
the MRIB group on the overall study cure rates is stated in the Zavicefta SmPC. 
Overall, taking into account the revised dose adjustment schema for renal impairment, the data are 
considered sufficient to support an indication for cIAI but the MRIB results and the limitations of the 
Assessment report

Page 114/120 
 
 
 
 
 
patient population treated (including the low APACHE II scores), as well as the imbalance in deaths, 
should be reported in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
cUTI 
In support of this indication there are clinical efficacy data from RECAPTURE, in which at least 5 days 
IV was required before oral switch, and from REPRISE in infections due to CAZ-R pathogens. Nearly 
half of patients in REPRISE and 72% in RECAPTURE had acute pyelonephritis but the response rates 
were generally similar to those for the cUTI population. 
Although neither study pre-defined a primary endpoint as recommended by CHMP the data from 
RECAPTURE were re-analysed accordingly and were reassuring regarding the comparative efficacy of 
CAZ-AVI vs. doripenem. The data from REPRISE were reported for <104 CFU/mL and for no growth and 
suggested that CAZ-AVI was at least as efficacious as BAT (noting that this study was not powered for 
formal inferential testing). REPRISE also provided a substantial body of evidence supporting the CAZ-
AVI dose for treatment of CAZ-R pathogens although, due to high drug concentrations predicted in the 
urinary tract, it cannot necessarily be assumed that the same level of efficacy will be exerted at other 
sites. It should also be noted that very few pathogens expressing serine carbapenemases have been 
treated with CAZ-AVI. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Thus far, the safety profile of CAZ-AVI has generally reflected that already known for CAZ alone. 
Overall, this is considered to be rather typical of the injectable cephalosporins so that SmPC 
statements similar to those for CAZ should mostly suffice. Thus, it is appropriate that the CAZ-AVI 
SmPC should include warnings pertaining to hypersensitivity, antibacterial agent-associated colitis and 
pseudo-membranous colitis due to Clostridium difficile, concurrent treatment with nephrotoxic 
medicinal products and development of a positive Coombs' test. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Although the safety database is considered to be adequate in size, it is not possible to draw any 
definitive conclusions regarding the possible effects of AVI on the ADR profile of CAZ. In addition, since 
the dose used in CAZ-AVI is the highest intermittent dose recommended for non-CF patients whereas 
the ADR frequencies reported for CAZ alone reflect broader usage, it is not appropriate to compare 
frequencies between CAZ-AVI and those reported for CAZ. Other constraints for interpretation of the 
data include the fact that reasonable comparisons of safety are possible only vs. carbapenems and only 
in patients with cIAI or cUTI. Hence it is not really so surprising that rates of some AEs more 
associated with cephalosporins than carbapenems are higher with CAZ-AVI. What is more, all CAZ-AVI 
patients with cIAI also received metronidazole, which confounds the comparisons made.  
After updating of the safety data during the procedure there was only a small imbalance in death rates 
for CAZ-AVI vs. pooled comparators across indications (37 deaths [21 CAZ-AVI], giving rates of 1.3% 
for CAZ-AVI vs. 1.0% for pooled comparators). When shown by indication there was a greater 
imbalance in rates for cIAI patients (18 [2.1%] vs. 12 [1.4%]). This number included 2 CAZ-AVI (both 
ascribed to disease progression) and 1 meropenem death in RECLAIM3. There were no deaths in 
RECAPTURE (all cUTI) and very few deaths in REPRISE (mostly UTI), with no imbalance. 
In the cIAI patients most deaths occurred before days 14-21 on study. Further exploration of the 
deaths revealed that in the MRIB/SRIB group 6 CAZ-AVI and 5 comparator patients had AEs with 
outcome of death but deaths due to disease progression occurred in 7 vs. 1 in respective treatment 
Assessment report

Page 115/120 
 
 
 
 
 
groups. It is not possible to ascribe or to rule out a contribution to the imbalance in deaths due to 
disease progression to temporary under-dosing. It can be observed that baseline APACHE II scores for 
the patients who died were higher than median baseline APACHE II scores across cIAI CAZ-AVI studies 
but this finding applied in both treatment groups. 
Overall, it remains possible that the remaining imbalance in deaths in cIAI patients occurred by chance 
and/or reflected at least in part dosing of MRIB patients in the initial phase of treatment and/or an 
imbalance in adequate surgical management. The imbalance is reflected in section 4.4.of the Zavicefta 
SmPC. 
Across all completed Phase 1 through Phase 3 studies of the CAZ-AVI programme there were 57 
subjects/patients (5 AVI, 29 CAZ-AVI +/- MTZ and 23 comparator) who had AEs identified as part of 
the search strategy used for the Renal disorder Safety Topics of Interest and/or met PCS elevations in 
creatinine (>2.0 × ULN and >100% increase from baseline). A detailed analysis of these patients and 
of all PCS values relating to renal function was undertaken. 
Of the 57 subjects/patients, 37 could be verified as having laboratory evidence that supported the AEs 
reported. Another 5 had baseline renal dysfunction and findings that did not suggest a contribution 
from AVI. In the remaining 32 patients (19 CAZ-AVI) there were 22 (11 CAZ-AVI) with normal function 
or mild impairment and 10 with MRIB/SRIB (8 CAZ-AVI). However, the information available provided 
a more likely explanation than CAZ-AVI-related AKI for most cases. The shifts and PCS tables do not 
suggest an excess risk for CAZ-AVI over comparators. 
The SmPC contains the statements and AEs that are based on the information available on ceftazidime, 
i.e. that CAZ can be associated with nephrotoxicity especially if combined with other nephrotoxic 
agents. It is not possible from available data to definitively conclude whether adding AVI increases the 
risk of AKI and whether the resulting rates of AKI exceed those observed with other commonly used 
antibacterial agents. The matter has been reflected in the RMP.  
There was an increased incidence in all categories of AEs with declining renal status. There were very 
few patients with SRIB. In the MRIB subgroup there were 6 CAZ-AVI patients with renal failure acute 
[3], renal failure [2] and renal impairment [1] but only one in the comparator group (renal 
impairment). These patients were investigated as described above.  
Other SOCs or PTs for which there was a higher reporting rate in the CAZ-AVI MRIB group were not 
indicative of AKI. In addition, in the MRIB population the only SOCs that showed higher rates for CAZ-
AVI were cardiac disorders (12.9% vs. 8.3%), gastrointestinal disorders (22.7% vs. 14.6%; rates of 
diarrhoea were comparable between treatments), injury/poisoning/procedural complications (9.1% vs. 
4.9%) and renal disorders (8.3% vs. 4.2%).  
In Phase 3 studies (except for RECAPTURE), the Coombs seroconversion rate is very high and much 
higher than what is reported for CAZ alone. In each study the denominator is only a fraction of the 
total study population but it does seem to be consistent that rates are much higher than reported for 
CAZ. Further investigation does not suggest that the high rate was driven by an additive effect of AVI. 
CHMP requested that the actual range of seroconversion rates, and not just the mean across studies, is 
reported in the Zavicefta SmPC. In addition CHMP noted that agranulocytosis, which is a SAE reported 
with the use of ceftazidime, was not reported in the clinical trial conducted in cIAI. 
The rates of elevated transaminases were further explored. It appears that elevations in AST and ALT 
are common but again it does not seem that the rates are driven by an additive effect of AVI at the 
dose used in CAZ-AVI. There have not as yet been any cases that have fully met Hy’s Law criteria 
across all studies with AVI, regardless of the beta-lactam partner. There was no detectable relationship

between plasma exposure to AVI and the risk of transaminase elevations but there was a weak 
association with CAZ exposures.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Taking into account the information already available on CAZ, the clinical efficacy data for CAZ-AVI in 
cUTI and cIAI, including CAZ-R pathogens, and the PK-PD analyses that support the dose adjustment 
schema and the application of the same posology to HAP/VAP patients, CHMP agreed that the 
indications applied for by the applicant are acceptable. Nevertheless, CHMP highlighted that these 
indications can only be accepted if the various limitations of the data are adequately reflected in the 
SmPC; the Applicant agreed to the CHMP request. The additional safety data from recently completed 
comparative studies in cIAI and cUTI have added considerably to the database and for the most part 
have been reassuring. For those remaining issues on which definitive conclusions could not be drawn, 
CHMP agreed that an adequate SmPC and RMP would be sufficient at this time point.

The benefit-risk assessment takes into account the antibacterial spectrum of CAZ-AVI as well as the 
fact that the beta-lactam agent is well known. The critical issue is to support the adequacy of the AVI 
dose and its safety profile. Current evidence supports the dose for the indications claimed and does not 
point to any major safety concerns. However, the SmPC has to adequately reflect the limitation so of 
the data as well as the imbalances noted in death rates and cure rates in the MRIB and high APACHE 
score sub-populations.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Zavicefta in the treatment of the following infections in adults (see 
sections 4.4 and 5.1): 
•  Complicated intra-abdominal Infection (cIAI) 
•  Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI), including pyelonephritis  
•  Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) 
Zavicefta is also indicated for the treatment of infections due to aerobic Gram-negative organisms in 
adult patients with limited treatment options (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). 
Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents.

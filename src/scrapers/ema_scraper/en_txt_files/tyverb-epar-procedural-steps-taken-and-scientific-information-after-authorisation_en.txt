based on results from study 
EGF114299/LAP016A2307 listed as a condition 
(ANX027.4) in the Annex II; a Phase III trial to 
compare the safety and efficacy of lapatinib plus 
trastuzumab plus an aromatase inhibitor (AI) versus 
trastuzumab plus an AI versus lapatinib plus an AI as 
first- or second-line therapy in postmenopausal 
subjects with hormone receptor positive, HER2-
positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) who have 
received prior trastuzumab and endocrine therapies. 
Annex II has been updated accordingly. A revised 
RMP version 35.1 has also been approved. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary 
of Product Characteristics and Annex II and to the 
Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
The CHMP is of the opinion that the following 
obligation has been fulfilled, and therefore 
recommends its deletion from the Annex II: 
“To present data in patients with hormone receptor-
positive metastatic breast cancer, not currently 
intended for chemotherapy, and previously treated 
with trastuzumab from:

the opinion that the quality, safety and efficacy of this

information on cardiac toxicity and severe diarrhoea the 
CHMP considered appropriate to update sections 4.2, 4.4 
and 4.8 of product information to strengthen the related 
warnings. Furthermore, the CHMP considered that section 
4.1 of the SmPC should mention for clarity that no data are 
available on the efficacy of lapatinib in combination with an 
aromatase inhibitor relative to trastuzumab in combination 
with an aromatase inhibitor in postmenopausal women with 
hormone receptor positive metastatic disease, not currently 
intended for chemotherapy. Based on the data available, 
the CHMP concluded that the Benefit/Risk balance of 
lapatinib in the currently approved indications remains 
favourable.

EGF105485 (TEACH) confirmed the results of previous 
retrospective analyses of pharmacogenetic data from 
multiple clinical trials which suggested an association of a 
Class II Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) locus, 
centred on the Human Leukocytic Antigen (HLA) alleles -
DQA1*02:01 and –DRB1*07:01, with lapatinib-induced 
elevation in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Results 
from EGF114471 showed convincing evidence of a causal 
relationship between carriage of the HLA alleles 
DQA1*02:01 and DRB1*07:01 and lapatinib-induced 
hepatotoxicity. The cumulative frequency of severe liver 
injury (ALT >5 times the upper limit of normal, NCI CTCAE 
grade 3) at 1 year of treatment was 2.8% overall. The 
cumulative frequency in DQA1*02:01 and DRB1*07:01 
allele carriers was 10.3% and in non-carriers was 0.5%. 
Carriage of the HLA risk alleles is common (15 to 25%) in 
Caucasian, Asian, African and Hispanic populations but 
lower (1%) in Japanese populations.

from interim analyses of two phase III studies which

C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
studies have shown that in some settings Tyverb is less 
effective than trastuzumab based treatment regimens. A 
randomised Phase III study (EGF111438) (N=540) 
compared the effect of the two regimens on the incidence 
of CNS as site of first relapse in women with HER2 
overexpressing metastatic breast cancer. The study was 
halted as the interim analysis (N=475) showed a low 
incidence of CNS events and, superior efficacy of the 
trastuzumab plus capecitabine arm in terms of progression-
free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The difference 
Page 19/30
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
between arms was most pronounced in the post-hoc 
subgroup (stratified for at randomisation) who had not 
received prior trastuzumab (prior treatment with 
trastuzumab is a requirement for the currently approved 
indication). Thus, the results were statistically significant in 
the interim analysis of the ITT population and in the 
subgroup who had not received prior trastuzumab. No 
statistically significant differences were observed, however, 
in the subgroup who had received prior trastuzumab 
(relevant for the currently approved second-line indication). 
A second study (EGF108919) was also terminated at 
interim analysis due to the superior efficacy with regard to 
PFS of trastuzumab compared to lapatinib, in combination 
with a taxane in first line therapy for women with HER2-
positive metastatic breast cancer. Tyverb is not approved in 
this indication.  
The CHMP concluded that the results confirmed the clinical 
practice of using trastuzumab-based regimens as a 
standard of care in this disease setting and considered that 
the benefit/risk balance of the currently approved indication 
of Tyverb as second line treatment in combination with 
capecitabine following therapy with trastuzumab in 
metastatic breast cancer was not affected by these findings 
and therefore remained positive. The product information 
has been updated accordingly.

information on cardiac function has been revised in

performed to PL section 6. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
was endorsed by the CHMP that the data do not 
demonstrate evidence to suggest direct renal toxicity 
associated with lapatinib. However, in several cases, it 
seems that lapatinib indirectly is causally related to the 
renal failure, for example by association with nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhoea and/or poor oral intake leading to 
dehydration which may result in renal failure. In addition, 
nine cases of renal failure secondary to severe dehydration 
associated with administration of lapatinib have been 
reported. In these cases the functional renal failure was 
secondary to a severe dehydration (leading sometimes to 
hypovolemic shock) due the occurrence of severe gastro-
intestinal toxicity with diarrhoea. Neither of the patients 
involved in these cases had pre-existing renal impairment. 
The CHMP recommended that the possibility of acute renal 
failure as a result of severe dehydration should be included 
in the Product Information. 
Regarding the information on cardiac function in the PL the 
following description is now listed under common side 
effects: "an effect on how your heart works" together with 
further information that in most cases the effect on the 
heart will not have any symptoms, but if symptoms 
associated with this side effect are experienced, these are 
likely to include an irregular heartbeat and shortness of

lapatinib with orally administered digoxin resulted in an 
approximate 80% increase in the AUC of digoxin. Caution 
should be exercised when dosing lapatinib concurrently 
with medications with narrow therapeutic windows that are 
substrates of Pgp, and a reduction in the dose of the Pgp 
substrate should be considered. 
Coadministration of lapatinib with intravenous paclitaxel 
increased the exposure of paclitaxel by 23%, due to 
lapatinib inhibition of CYP2C8 and/or Pgp. An increase in 
the incidence and severity of diarrhoea and neutropenia 
has been observed with this combination in clinical trials. 
Caution is advised if lapatinib is coadministered with 
paclitaxel. 
Coadministration of lapatinib with intravenously 
administered docetaxel did not significantly affect the AUC 
or Cmax of either active substance. However, the 
occurrence of docetaxel-induced neutropenia was

midazolam resulted in an approximate 45% increase in the 
AUC of midazolam. There was no clinically meaningful 
increase in AUC when midazolam was dosed intravenously. 
Therefore it is suggested that lapatinib is unlikely to 
significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of intravenously 
administered drugs that are substrates of CYP3A4. 
However, coadministration of lapatinib with orally 
administered medicines with narrow therapeutic windows 
that are substrates of CYP3A4 (e.g. cisapride, pimozide and 
quinidine) or CYP2C8 (e.g. repaglinide) should be avoided. 
Coadministration of lapatinib with irinotecan (when 
administered as part of the FOLFIRI regimen) resulted in an 
approximate 40% increase in the AUC of SN 38, the active 
metabolite of irinotecan. The precise mechanism of this 
interaction is unknown, but it is assumed to be due to 
inhibition of one or more transport proteins by lapatinib. 
Adverse reactions should be carefully monitored if lapatinib

is co-administered with irinotecan, and a reduction in the 
dose of irinotecan should be considered. 
Asymptomatic and symptomatic cases of overdose have 
been reported in patients being treated with lapatinib. In 
patients who took up to 5000 mg of lapatinib, symptoms 
observed include known lapatinib associated events and in 
some cases sore scalp and/or mucosal inflammation. In a 
single case of a patient who took 9000 mg of lapatinib, 
sinus tachycardia (with otherwise normal ECG) was also 
observed. In the majority of cases, symptoms resolved 
upon interruption of lapatinib treatment.

female rats, the carcinogenicity studies were of acceptable 
quality to reach conclusions about the carcinogenic 
potential of lapatinib. The exposure to lapatinib at the 
highest evaluable doses were >2 times higher than the 
clinical exposure at te maimum daily dose of 1250 mg. 
The mouse study showed no evidence of a carcinogenic 
potential. There was an increased incidence of benign 
haemangioma of the mesenteric lymph nodes in both male 
and female rats. The incidences were within the 
background range from historical data, and although a 
relation to treatment cannot be fully excluded the findings 
do not raise concerns for the current indication. In the rat 
study there were findings of renal infarcts and papillary 
necrosis, not previously described in non clinical toxicology 
studies. The MAH argued that the renal infarcts are related 
to a long-standing chronic dermal inflammation/infection of 
the skin resulting from skin lesions caused by lapatinib. 
There was no evidence from clinical trials that the renal 
findings are of clinical relevance.

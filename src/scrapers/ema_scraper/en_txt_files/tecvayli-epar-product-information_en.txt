CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
TECVAYLI is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and 
refractory multiple myeloma, who have received at least three prior therapies, including an 
immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor, and an anti-CD38 antibody and have demonstrated 
disease progression on the last therapy.
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Treatment with TECVAYLI should be initiated and supervised by physicians experienced in the 
treatment of multiple myeloma.
TECVAYLI should be administered by a healthcare professional with adequately trained medical 
personnel and appropriate medical equipment to manage severe reactions, including cytokine release 
syndrome (CRS) (see section 4.4).
Posology
Pre-treatment medicinal products should be administered prior to each dose of TECVAYLI in the 
step-up dosing schedule (see below).
2
TECVAYLI step-up dosing schedule should not be administered in patients with active infection (see 
Table 3 and section 4.4).
Recommended dosing schedule
The recommended dosing schedule for TECVAYLI is provided in Table 1. The recommended doses 
of TECVAYLI are 1.5 mg/kg by subcutaneous injection (SC) weekly, preceded by step-up doses of 
0.06 mg/kg and 0.3 mg/kg. In patients who have a complete response or better for a minimum of 
6 months, a reduced dosing frequency of 1.5 mg/kg SC every two weeks may be considered (see 
section 5.1).
Treatment with TECVAYLI should be initiated according to the step-up dosing schedule in Table 1 to 
reduce the incidence and severity of cytokine release syndrome. Due to the risk of cytokine release 
syndrome, patients should be instructed to remain within proximity of a healthcare facility, and 
monitored for signs and symptoms daily for 48 hours after administration of all doses within the 
TECVAYLI step-up dosing schedule (see section 4.4).
Failure to follow the recommended doses or dosing schedule for initiation of therapy, or re-initiation 
of therapy after dose delays, may result in increased frequency and severity of adverse reactions 
related to mechanism of action, particularly cytokine release syndrome (see section 4.4).

Special warnings and precautions for use
Traceability
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.
Cytokine release syndrome (CRS)
Cytokine release syndrome, including life-threatening or fatal reactions, may occur in patients 
receiving TECVAYLI.
Clinical signs and symptoms of CRS may include but are not limited to fever, hypoxia, chills, 
hypotension, tachycardia, headache, and elevated liver enzymes. Potentially life-threatening 
complications of CRS may include cardiac dysfunction, adult respiratory distress syndrome, 
neurologic toxicity, renal and/or hepatic failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
Treatment should be initiated with TECVAYLI according to the step-up dosing schedule to reduce 
risk of CRS. Pre-treatment medicinal products (corticosteroids, antihistamine and antipyretics) should 
7
be administered prior to each dose of the TECVAYLI step-up dosing schedule to reduce risk of CRS 
(see section 4.2).
The following patients should be instructed to remain within proximity of a healthcare facility and 
monitored daily for 48 hours:


If the patient has received any dose within the TECVAYLI step-up dosing schedule (for CRS).
If the patient has received TECVAYLI after experiencing Grade 2 or higher CRS.
Patients who experience CRS following their previous dose should be administered pre-treatment 
medicinal products prior to the next dose of TECVAYLI.
Patients should be counselled to seek medical attention should signs or symptoms of CRS occur. At 
the first sign of CRS, patients should be immediately evaluated for hospitalisation. Treatment with 
supportive care, tocilizumab and/or corticosteroids should be instituted, based on severity as indicated 
in Table 4 below. The use of myeloid growth factors, particularly granulocyte macrophage-colony 
stimulating factor (GM-CSF), has the potential to worsen CRS symptoms and should be avoided 
during CRS. Treatment with TECVAYLI should be withheld until CRS resolves as indicated in 
Table 3 (see section 4.2).
Management of cytokine release syndrome
CRS should be identified based on clinical presentation. Patients should be evaluated and treated for 
other causes of fever, hypoxia, and hypotension.
If CRS is suspected, TECVAYLI should be withheld until the adverse reaction resolves (see Table 3). 
CRS should be managed according to the recommendations in Table 4. Supportive care for CRS 
(including but not limited to anti-pyretic agents, intravenous fluid support, vasopressors, supplemental 
oxygen, etc.) should be administered as appropriate. Laboratory testing to monitor for disseminated 
intravascular coagulation (DIC), haematology parameters, as well as pulmonary, cardiac, renal, and 
hepatic function should be considered.

9
Neurologic toxicities, including ICANS
Serious or life-threatening neurologic toxicities, including Immune Effector Cell-Associated 
Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS) occurred following treatment with TECVAYLI.
Patients should be monitored for signs or symptoms of neurologic toxicities during treatment and 
treated promptly.
Patients should be counselled to seek medical attention should signs or symptoms of neurologic 
toxicity occur. At the first sign of neurologic toxicity, including ICANS, patients should be 
immediately evaluated and treated based on severity. Patients who experience Grade 2 or higher 
ICANS or first occurrence of Grade 3 ICANS with the previous dose of TECVAYLI should be 
instructed to remain within proximity of a healthcare facility and monitored for signs and symptoms 
daily for 48 hours.
For ICANS and other neurologic toxicities, treatment with TECVAYLI should be withheld as 
indicated in Table 3 (see section 4.2).
Due to the potential for ICANS, patients should be advised not to drive or operate heavy machinery 
during the TECVAYLI step-up dosing schedule and for 48 hours after completing the TECVAYLI 
step-up dosing schedule and in the event of new onset of any neurological symptoms (see section 4.7).
Management of neurologic toxicities
At the first sign of neurologic toxicity, including ICANS, neurology evaluation should be considered. 
Other causes of neurologic symptoms should be ruled out. TECVAYLI should be withheld until 
adverse reaction resolves (see Table 3). Intensive care and supportive therapy should be provided for 
severe or life-threatening neurologic toxicities. General management for neurologic toxicity (e.g., 
ICANS with or without concurrent CRS) is summarised in Table 5.

Infections
Severe, life-threatening, or fatal infections have been reported in patients receiving TECVAYLI (see 
section 4.8). New or reactivated viral infections occurred during therapy with TECVAYLI. 
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) has also occurred during therapy with 
TECVAYLI.
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infection prior to and during treatment with 
TECVAYLI and treated appropriately. Prophylactic antimicrobials should be administered according 
to local institutional guidelines.
TECVAYLI step-up dosing schedule should not be administered in patients with active infection. For 
subsequent doses, TECVAYLI should be withheld as indicated in Table 3 (see section 4.2).
Hepatitis B virus reactivation
Hepatitis B virus reactivation can occur in patients treated with medicinal products directed against B 
cells, and in some cases, may result in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death.
12
Patients with evidence of positive HBV serology should be monitored for clinical and laboratory signs 
of HBV reactivation while receiving TECVAYLI, and for at least six months following the end of 
TECVAYLI treatment.
In patients who develop reactivation of HBV while on TECVAYLI, treatment with TECVAYLI 
should be withheld as indicated in Table 3 and manage per local institutional guidelines (see 
section 4.2).
Hypogammaglobulinaemia
Hypogammaglobulinaemia has been reported in patients receiving TECVAYLI (see section 4.8).
Immunoglobulin levels should be monitored during treatment with TECVAYLI. Intravenous or 
subcutaneous immunoglobulin therapy was used to treat hypogammaglobulinaemia in 39% of patients.
Patients should be treated according to local institutional guidelines, including infection precautions, 
antibiotic or antiviral prophylaxis, and administration of immunoglobulin replacement.
Vaccines
Immune response to vaccines may be reduced when taking TECVAYLI.
The safety of immunisation with live viral vaccines during or following TECVAYLI treatment has not 
been studied. Vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended for at least 4 weeks prior to the 
start of treatment, during treatment and least 4 weeks after treatment.
Neutropenia
Neutropenia and febrile neutropenia have been reported in patients who received TECVAYLI (see 
section 4.8).
Complete blood cell counts should be monitored at baseline and periodically during treatment. 
Supportive care should be provided per local institutional guidelines.
Patients with neutropenia should be monitored for signs of infection.
Treatment with TECVAYLI should be withheld as indicated in Table 3 (see section 4.2).
Excipients
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed with TECVAYLI.
The initial release of cytokines associated with the start of TECVAYLI treatment could suppress 
CYP450 enzymes. The highest risk of interaction is expected to be from initiation of TECVAYLI 
step-up schedule up to 7 days after the first maintenance dose or during a CRS event. During this time 
period, toxicity or medicinal product concentrations (e.g., cyclosporine) should be monitored in 
patients who are receiving concomitant CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index. The dose 
of the concomitant medicinal product should be adjusted as needed.

Pregnancy status for females of child-bearing potential should be verified prior to starting treatment 
with TECVAYLI.
Women of child-bearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment and for 
five months after the final dose of TECVAYLI. In clinical studies, male patients with a female partner 
of child-bearing potential used effective contraception during treatment and for three months after the 
last dose of teclistamab.
Pregnancy
There are no available data on the use of teclistamab in pregnant women or animal data to assess the 
risk of teclistamab in pregnancy. Human IgG is known to cross the placenta after the first trimester of 
pregnancy. Therefore, teclistamab, a humanised IgG4-based antibody, has the potential to be 
transmitted from the mother to the developing foetus. TECVAYLI is not recommended for women 
who are pregnant. TECVAYLI is associated with hypogammaglobulinaemia, therefore, assessment of 
immunoglobulin levels in newborns of mothers treated with TECVAYLI should be considered.
Breast-feeding
It is not known whether teclistamab is excreted in human or animal milk, affects breast-fed infants or 
affects milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breast-fed infants 
from TECVAYLI, patients should be advised not to breast-feed during treatment with TECVAYLI 
and for at least five months after the last dose.
Fertility
There are no data on the effect of teclistamab on fertility. Effects of teclistamab on male and female 
fertility have not been evaluated in animal studies.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
TECVAYLI has major influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
Due to the potential for ICANS, patients receiving TECVAYLI are at risk of depressed level of 
consciousness (see section 4.8). Patients should be instructed to avoid driving and operating heavy or 
potentially dangerous machinery during and for 48 hours after completion of TECVAYLI step-up 
dosing schedule and in the event of new onset of any neurological symptoms (Table 1) (see section 4.2 
and section 4.4).
4.8 Undesirable effects
The most frequent adverse reactions of any grade in patients were hypogammaglobulinaemia (75%), 
cytokine release syndrome (72%), neutropenia (71%), anaemia (55%), musculoskeletal pain (52%), 
fatigue (41%), thrombocytopenia (40%), injection site reaction (38%), upper respiratory tract infection 
(37%), lymphopenia (35%), diarrhoea (28%), pneumonia (28%), nausea (27%), pyrexia (27%),
headache (24%), cough (24%), constipation (21%) and pain (21%).
Serious adverse reactions were reported in 65% patients who received TECVAYLI, including 
pneumonia (16%), COVID-19 (15%), cytokine release syndrome (8%), sepsis (7%), pyrexia (5%), 
musculoskeletal pain (5%), acute kidney injury (4.8%), diarrhoea (3.0%), cellulitis (2.4%), hypoxia 
(2.4%), febrile neutropenia (2.4%), and encephalopathy (2.4%).

Tabulated list of adverse reactions
The safety data of TECVAYLI was evaluated in MajesTEC-1, which included 165 adult patients with 
multiple myeloma who received the recommended dosing regimen of TECVAYLI as monotherapy. 
The median duration of TECVAYLI treatment was 8.5 (Range: 0.2 to 24.4) months.
Table 6 summarises adverse reactions reported in patients who received TECVAYLI. The safety data 
of TECVAYLI was also evaluated in the all treated population (N=302) with no additional adverse 
reactions identified.
Adverse reactions observed during clinical studies are listed below by frequency category. Frequency 
categories are defined as follows: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon 
(≥1/1 000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10 000 to <1/1 000); very rare (<1/10 000) and not known (frequency 
cannot be estimated from the available data).
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions
Cytokine release syndrome
In MajesTEC-1 (N=165), CRS was reported in 72% of patients following treatment with TECVAYLI. 
One-third (33%) of patients experienced more than one CRS event. Most patients experienced CRS 
following Step-up Dose 1 (44%), Step-up Dose 2 (35%), or the initial maintenance dose (24%). Less 
than 3% of patients developed first occurrence of CRS following subsequent doses of TECVAYLI. 
CRS events were Grade 1 (50%) and Grade 2 (21%) or Grade 3 (0.6%). The median time to onset of 
CRS was 2 (Range: 1 to 6) days after the most recent dose, with a median duration of 2 (Range: 1 to 9) 
days.
The most frequent signs and symptoms associated with CRS were fever (72%), hypoxia (13%), chills 
(12%), hypotension (12%), sinus tachycardia (7%), headache (7%), and elevated liver enzymes 
(aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase elevation) (3.6% each).
In MajesTEC-1, tocilizumab, corticosteroids and tocilizumab in combination with corticosteroids were 
used to treat CRS in 32%, 11% and 3% of CRS events, respectively.
Neurologic toxicities, including ICANS
In MajesTEC-1 (N=165), neurologic toxicity events were reported in 15% of patients receiving 
TECVAYLI. Neurologic toxicity events were Grade 1 (8.5%), Grade 2 (5.5%), or Grade 4 (<1%). The 
most frequently reported neurologic toxicity event was headache (8%).
17
ICANS, including Grade 3 and higher, were reported in clinical trials and with post-marketing 
experience. The most frequent clinical manifestation of ICANS were confusional state, decreased level 
of consciousness, disorientation, dysgraphia, aphasia, apraxia, and somnolence. The onset of 
neurologic toxicity can be concurrent with CRS, following resolution of CRS, or in the absence of 
CRS. The observed time to onset of ICANS ranged from 0 to 21 days after the most recent dose.
Immunogenicity
Patients treated with subcutaneous teclistamab monotherapy (N=238) in MajesTEC-1 were evaluated 
for antibodies to teclistamab using an electrochemiluminescence-based immunoassay. One subject 
(0.4%) developed neutralising antibodies to teclistamab of low-titre.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
Symptoms and signs
The maximum tolerated dose of teclistamab has not been determined. In clinical studies, doses of up to 
6 mg/kg have been administered.
Treatment
In the event of an overdose, the patient should be monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse 
reactions, and appropriate symptomatic treatment should be instituted immediately.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other monoclonal antibodies and antibody drug conjugates, ATC code: 
L01FX24
Mechanism of action
Teclistamab is a full-size, IgG4-PAA bispecific antibody that targets the CD3 receptor expressed on 
the surface of T cells and B cell maturation antigen (BCMA), which is expressed on the surface of 
malignant multiple myeloma B-lineage cells, as well as late-stage B cells and plasma cells. With its 
dual binding sites, teclistamab is able to draw CD3+ T cells in close proximity to BCMA+ cells, 
resulting in T cell activation and subsequent lysis and death of BCMA+ cells, which is mediated by 
secreted perforin and various granzymes stored in the secretory vesicles of cytotoxic T cells. This 
effect occurs without regard to T cell receptor specificity or reliance on major histocompatibility 
complex (MHC) Class 1 molecules on the surface of antigen presenting cells.
Pharmacodynamic effects
Within the first month of treatment, activation of T-cells, redistribution of T-cells, reduction of B-cells 
and induction of serum cytokines were observed.
18
Within one month of treatment with teclistamab, the majority of responders had reduction in soluble 
BCMA, and a greater reduction in soluble BCMA was observed in subjects with deeper responses to 
teclistamab.
Clinical efficacy and safety
The efficacy of TECVAYLI monotherapy was evaluated in patients with relapsed or refractory 
multiple myeloma in a single-arm, open-label, multi-centre, Phase 1/2 study (MajesTEC-1). The study 
included patients who had previously received at least three prior therapies, including a proteasome 
inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody. The study excluded 
patients who experienced stroke or seizure within the past 6 months, and patients with Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group performance score (ECOG PS) ≥2, plasma cell leukaemia, known active 
CNS involvement or exhibited clinical signs of meningeal involvement of multiple myeloma, or active 
or documented history of autoimmune disease with the exception of vitiligo, Type 1 diabetes and prior 
autoimmune thyroiditis.
Patients received initial step-up doses of 0.06 mg/kg and 0.3 mg/kg of TECVAYLI administered 
subcutaneously, followed by the maintenance dose of TECVAYLI 1.5 mg/kg, administered 
subcutaneously once weekly thereafter, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients 
who had a complete response (CR) or better for a minimum of 6 months were eligible to reduce dosing 
frequency to 1.5 mg/kg subcutaneously every two weeks until disease progression or unacceptable 
toxicity (see section 4.2). The median duration between Step-up Dose 1 and Step-up Dose 2 was 2.9 
(Range: 2-7) days. The median duration between Step-up Dose 2 and the initial maintenance dose was 
3.1 (Range: 2-9) days. Patients were hospitalised for monitoring for at least 48 hours after 
administration of each dose of the TECVAYLI Step-up dosing schedule.
The efficacy population included 165 patients. The median age was 64 (Range: 33-84) years with 15% 
of subjects ≥75 years of age; 58% were male; 81% were White, 13% were Black, 2% were Asian. The 
International Staging System (ISS) at study entry was 52% in Stage I, 35% in Stage II and 12% in 
Stage III. High-risk cytogenetics (presence of del(17p), t(4;14) or t(14;16)) were present in 26% of 
patients. Seventeen percent of patients had extramedullary plasmacytomas.
The median time since initial diagnosis of multiple myeloma to enrolment was 6 (Range: 0.8-22.7) 
years. The median number of prior therapies was 5 (Range: 2-14), with 23% of patients who received 
3 prior therapies. Eighty-two percent of patients received prior autologous stem cell transplantation, 
and 4.8% of patients received prior allogeneic transplantation. Seventy-eight percent of patients were 
triple-class refractory (refractory to proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent and an 
anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody).
Efficacy results were based on overall response rate, as determined by the Independent Review 
Committee (IRC) assessment, using International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) 2016 criteria 
(see Table 7).

switched to 1.5 mg/kg subcutaneously every two weeks.
Paediatric population
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
TECVAYLI in all subsets of the paediatric population in multiple myeloma (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use).
This medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called ‘conditional approval’ scheme.
This means that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited.
The European Medicines Agency will review new information on this medicinal product at least every 
year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary.
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
Teclistamab exhibited approximately dose-proportional pharmacokinetics following subcutaneous
administration across a dose range of 0.08 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg (0.05 to 2.0 times the recommended 
dose). Ninety percent of steady state exposure was achieved after 12 weekly maintenance doses. The 
mean accumulation ratio between the first and 13th weekly maintenance dose of teclistamab 1.5 mg/kg 
was 4.2-fold for Cmax, 4.1-fold for Ctrough, and 5.3-fold for AUCtau.
The Cmax, Ctrough, and AUCtau of teclistamab are presented in Table 8.

Absorption
The mean bioavailability of teclistamab was 72% when administered subcutaneously. The median 
(range) Tmax of teclistamab after the first and 13th weekly maintenance doses were 139 (19 to 168) 
hours and 72 (24 to 168) hours, respectively.
20
Distribution
The mean volume of distribution was 5.63 L (29% coefficient of variation (CV)).
Elimination
Teclistamab clearance decreases over time, with a mean (CV%) maximal reduction from baseline to 
the 13th weekly maintenance dose of 40.8% (56%). The geometric mean (CV%) clearance is 
0.472 L/day (64%) at the 13th weekly maintenance dose. Patients who discontinue teclistamab after the 
13th weekly maintenance dose are expected to have a 50% reduction from Cmax in teclistamab 
concentration at a median (5th to 95th percentile) time of 15 (7 to 33) days after Tmax and a 97% 
reduction from Cmax in teclistamab concentration at a median time of 69 (32 to 163) days after Tmax.
Population pharmacokinetic analysis (based on MajesTEC-1) showed that soluble BCMA did not 
impact teclistamab serum concentrations.
Special populations
The pharmacokinetics of TECVAYLI in paediatric patients aged 17 years and younger have not been 
investigated.
Results of population pharmacokinetic analyses indicate that age (24 to 84 years) and sex did not 
influence the pharmacokinetics of teclistamab.
Renal impairment
No formal studies of TECVAYLI in patients with renal impairment have been conducted.
Results of population pharmacokinetic analyses indicate that mild renal impairment 
(60 mL/min/1.73 m2 ≤ estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <90 mL/min/1.73 m2) or moderate 
renal impairment (30 mL/min/1.73 m2 ≤ eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2) did not significantly influence 
the pharmacokinetics of teclistamab. Limited data are available from patients with severe renal 
impairment.
Hepatic impairment
No formal studies of TECVAYLI in patients with hepatic impairment have been conducted.
Results of population pharmacokinetic analyses indicate that mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin 
>1 to 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) and any aspartate aminotransferase (AST), or total 
bilirubin ≤ULN and AST>ULN) did not significantly influence the pharmacokinetics of teclistamab. 
No data are available in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Carcinogenicity and mutagenicity
No animal studies have been performed to assess the carcinogenic or genotoxic potential of 
teclistamab.
Reproductive toxicology and fertility
No animal studies have been conducted to evaluate the effects of teclistamab on reproduction and 
foetal development. In the 5-week repeat-dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys, there were no 
notable effects in the male and female reproductive organs at doses up to 30 mg/kg/week 
(approximately 22 times the maximum recommended human dose, based on AUC exposure) 
intravenously for five weeks.

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What TECVAYLI is and what it is used for
TECVAYLI is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance ‘teclistamab’ and is used to treat 
adults with a type of cancer of the bone marrow called multiple myeloma.
It is used for patients who have had at least three other kinds of treatment that have not worked or have 
stopped working.
How TECVAYLI works
TECVAYLI is an antibody, a type of protein which has been designed to recognise and attach to 
specific targets in your body. TECVAYLI targets B cell maturation antigen (BCMA), which is found 
on multiple myeloma cancer cells, and cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3), which is found on so-called 
T cells of your immune system. This medicine works by attaching to these cells and bringing them 
together, so that your immune system can destroy the multiple myeloma cancer cells.
2. What you need to know before you are given TECVAYLI
You must not be given TECVAYLI if you are allergic to teclistamab, or any of the other ingredients 
of this medicine (listed in section 6).
If you are not sure if you are allergic, talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given TECVAYLI.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given TECVAYLI if you have had a stroke or seizure 
within the past 6 months.
TECVAYLI and vaccines
Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given TECVAYLI if you have had a recent vaccination or 
are going to have a vaccination.
38
You should not receive live vaccines from four weeks before until four weeks after you are treated 
with TECVAYLI.
Tests and checks
Before you are given TECVAYLI, your doctor will check your blood counts for signs of infection. If 
you have any infection, it will be treated before you start TECVAYLI. Your doctor will also check if 
you are pregnant or breast-feeding.
During treatment with TECVAYLI, your doctor will monitor you for side effects. Your doctor will 
regularly check your blood counts, as the number of blood cells and other blood components may 
decrease.
Look out for serious side effects.
Tell your doctor or nurse right away if you experience any of the following:

Signs of a condition known as ‘cytokine release syndrome’ (CRS). Cytokine release syndrome 
is a serious immune reaction with symptoms such as fever, chills, nausea, headache, fast 
heartbeat, feeling dizzy, and difficulty breathing.
Effects on your nervous system. Symptoms include feeling confused, feeling less alert, sleepy, 
or having difficulty writing and/or speaking. Some of these may be signs of a serious immune 
reaction called ‘immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome’ (ICANS).
Signs and symptoms of an infection.


Tell your doctor or nurse if you notice any signs of the above.
Children and adolescents
Do not give TECVAYLI to children or young people below 18 years of age, because it is not known 
how this medicine will affect them.
Other medicines and TECVAYLI
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines. 
This includes medicines you can get without a prescription and herbal medicines.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
It is not known if TECVAYLI affects an unborn baby or if it passes into breast milk.
Pregnancy-information for women
Tell your doctor or nurse before you are given TECVAYLI if you are pregnant, think you might be 
pregnant or are planning to have a baby.
If you become pregnant while being treated with this medicine, tell your doctor or nurse straight away.
Pregnancy-information for men
If your partner becomes pregnant while you are taking this medicine, tell your doctor straight away.
Contraception – information for women who could become pregnant
If you could become pregnant, you must use effective contraception during treatment and for 5 months 
after stopping treatment with TECVAYLI.
Contraception – information for men
If your partner could become pregnant, you must use effective contraception during treatment and for 
3 months after stopping treatment with TECVAYLI.
Breast-feeding
You and your doctor will decide if the benefit of breast-feeding is greater than the risk to your baby. If 
you and your doctor decide to stop taking this medicine, you should not breast-feed for 5 months after 
stopping treatment.
39
Driving and using machines
Some people may feel tired, dizzy, or confused while taking TECVAYLI. Do not drive, use tools, 
operate heavy machinery, or do things that could pose a danger to yourself until at least 48 hours after 
receiving your third dose of TECVAYLI, or as instructed by your doctor.
TECVAYLI contains sodium
TECVAYLI contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’.
3.
How TECVAYLI is given
How much is given
Your doctor will determine your dose of TECVAYLI. The dose will depend on your body weight. The 
first two doses will be lower.
TECVAYLI is given as follows:



You will receive 0.06 mg for each kilogram of bodyweight for your first dose.
You will receive 0.3 mg per kilogram of bodyweight as your second dose 2-7 days later.
You will then receive a ‘Maintenance dose’ of 1.5 mg per kilogram of bodyweight 2-7 days 
after your second dose.
You will then continue receiving a ‘Maintenance dose’ once a week as long as you are getting 
benefit from TECVAYLI.

If you are continuing to receive benefit from TECVAYLI after 6 months, your doctor may decide that 
you will receive a ‘Maintenance dose’ every two weeks.
Your doctor will monitor you for side effects after each of your first three doses. They will do this for 
2 days after each dose.
You should stay close to a healthcare facility after the first three doses in case you have side effects.
How the medicine is given
TECVAYLI will be given to you by a doctor or nurse as an injection under your skin (‘subcutaneous’ 
injection). It is given in the stomach area (abdomen) or thigh.
Other medicines given during treatment with TECVAYLI
You will be given medicines 1-3 hours before each of your first three doses of TECVAYLI, which 
help to lower the chance of side effects, such as cytokine release syndrome. These may include:



medicines to reduce the risk of an allergic reaction (antihistamines)
medicines to reduce the risk of inflammation (corticosteroids)
medicines to reduce the risk of fever (such as paracetamol)
You may also be given these medicines for later doses of TECVAYLI based on any symptoms you 
have.
You may also be given additional medicines based on any symptoms you experience or your medical 
history.
If you are given more TECVAYLI than you should
This medicine will be given by your doctor or nurse, and it is unlikely that you will receive too much.
In the event that you are given too much (an overdose), your doctor will check you for side effects.
If you forget your appointment to have TECVAYLI
It is very important to go to all your appointments. If you miss an appointment, make another one as 
soon as possible.
40
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse.
4.


Remove the appropriate strength TECVAYLI vial from refrigerated storage (2 °C–8 °C) and 
equilibrate to ambient temperature (15 °C – 30 °C), as needed, for at least 15 minutes. Do not 
warm TECVAYLI in any other way.
Once equilibrated, gently swirl the vial for approximately 10 seconds to mix. Do not shake.
Withdraw the required injection volume of TECVAYLI from the vial(s) into an appropriately 
sized syringe using a transfer needle.
o
Each injection volume should not exceed 2.0 mL. Divide doses requiring greater than 
2.0 mL equally into multiple syringes.
TECVAYLI is compatible with stainless steel needles, polypropylene and polycarbonate 
syringe material.
Replace the transfer needle with an appropriately sized needle for injection.
Visually inspect TECVAYLI for particulate matter and discolouration prior to administration. 
Do not use if the solution is discoloured, or cloudy, or if foreign particles are present.
o
TECVAYLI solution for injection is colourless to light yellow.
46
Administration of TECVAYLI

Inject the required volume of TECVAYLI into the subcutaneous tissue of the abdomen 
(preferred injection site). Alternatively, TECVAYLI may be injected into the subcutaneous 
tissue of the thigh. If multiple injections are required, TECVAYLI injections should be at least 
2 cm apart.
Do not inject into tattoos or scars or areas where the skin is red, bruised, tender, hard or not 
intact.

Traceability
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

SCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS AND GROUNDS FOR THE VARIATION TO THE TERMS
OF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION(S)
ANNEX IV
48
Scientific conclusions
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for teclistamab, the scientific 
conclusions of the PRAC are as follows:
In view of available data on Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) from 
clinical trials and spontaneous reports including new symptoms of ICANS and in 6 cases of Grade 3 
and higher ICANS with a close temporal relationship, and in view of a fact that ICANS is already 
known adverse reaction of teclistamab, the PRAC Rapporteur considers a causal relationship between 
teclistamab and new symptoms of ICANS and Grade 3 and higher ICANS is at least a reasonable 
possibility. The PRAC Rapporteur concluded that the product information of products containing 
teclistamab should be amended accordingly.
Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conslusions 
and grounds for recommendation. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s)
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for teclistamab the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing teclistamab is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information.
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

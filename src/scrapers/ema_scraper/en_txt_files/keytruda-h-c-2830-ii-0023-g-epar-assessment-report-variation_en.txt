2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Keytruda  (pembrolizumab,  MK-3475) is  a  humanised  monoclonal  antibody  acting  as  immune  checkpoint 
inhibitor  through  the  block  of  the  interaction  between  the  programmed  death-1  (PD-1)  receptor  and  its 
ligands PD-L1 and PDL2, with a consequent impediment of inhibitory signal in T cells. 
Urothelial cancer (UC) is an aggressive malignancy associated with a 5 years survival of about 5% in the 
metastatic  setting.  More  than  90%  of  urothelial  tract  tumours  pertain  to  bladder,  8%  originate  in  the 
renal  pelvis  and  the  remaining  2%  arise  from  ureter  and  urethra.  In  the  large  majority  of  cases,  the 
histological  subtype  is  transitional  cell  carcinoma.  The  other  types,  including  lymphoepithelioma-like  or 
sarcomatoid  carcinoma,  micropapillary  or  nested  variants  and  primary  squamous  cell  carcinoma  and 
adenocarcinoma, are relatively uncommon. 
Approximately  4%  of  patients  have  metastatic  disease  at  the  time  of  diagnosis.  Cisplatin-containing 
combination  chemotherapy  has  been  the  standard  of  care  in  the  treatment  of  advanced  or  metastatic 
urothelial  cancer  since  the  late  1980s.  A  median  OS  of  about  14  months  has  been  observed  with  the 
combination  of  cisplatin/gemcitabine  or  MVAC  (methotrexate,  vinblastine,  adriamycin  and  cisplatin)  in 
advanced surgically unresectable and metastatic urothelial cancer patients (von der Maase H, J Clin Oncol 
2005).  No  improvement  in  survival  has  been  achieved  with  newer  triplets,  novel  four-drug  regimens  or 
dose-dense chemotherapy (Bellmunt J, J Clin Oncol 2012; Milowsky MI, J Clin Oncol 2009). 
More than 50% of patients are unfit for cisplatin due to poor performance status, impaired renal function, 
or  specific  comorbidities.  For  these  patients,  NCCN  Guidelines  (version  2.2017)  and  ESMO  Practice 
Guideline (Bellmunt J, Annals of Oncology 2014) recommend carboplatin-based regimens or single agent 
taxane  or  gemcitabine.  A  median  OS  of  9  months  has  been  reported  with  the  carboplatin/gemcitabine 
combination (De Santis M, J Clin Oncol 2012). In case of patients with PS ≥2 and poor renal function, the 
participation in clinical trials or BSC is recommended by ESMO guidelines. 
Failing first-line platinum-based chemotherapy, the prognosis is compromised with a median OS reduced 
to 5 to 7 months (Bellmunt J, J Clin Oncol 2009). In this setting there is no globally recognised standard 
of  care,  and  vinflunine  is  the  only  drug  approved  in  EU  for  the  treatment  of  advanced  or  metastatic 
transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelial tract after failure of a prior platinum-containing regimen. 
The role of immunotherapy in UC was first established in the 1970s with the use of BCG for non-muscle 
invasive  bladder  cancer.  Urothelial  carcinoma  appears  to  be immunogenic,  with  high  expression  level  of 
PD-L1 (Boorjian SA, Clin Cancer Res 2008; Faraj SF, Urology 2015).  
In  EU,  Keytruda  received  a  MA  on  17  July  2015  as  monotherapy  for  the  treatment  of  advanced 
(unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in adults, and was approved as monotherapy on 29 July 2016 for 
the  treatment  of  previously  treated  PD-L1  TPS  ≥1%  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  NSCLC  patients  and 
on 27 January 2017 for the first-line treatment of metastatic PD-L1 TPS ≥50% NSCLC. 
The current application is a type II variation to extend the indication in treatment of locally advanced or 
metastatic urothelial carcinoma both in patients previously treated with chemotherapy, based on results 
from the study KEYNOTE-045 (“A Phase III Randomized Clinical Trial of Pembrolizumab versus Paclitaxel, 
Docetaxel or Vinflunine  in Subjects with Recurrent or Progressive Metastatic Urothelial Cancer”), and in 
those  not  eligible  for  cisplatin-containing  chemotherapy,  based  on  results  from  the  study  KEYNOTE-052 
(“A  Phase  II  Clinical  Trial  of  Pembrolizumab  in  Subjects  with  Advanced/Unresectable  or  Metastatic 
Urothelial Cancer”).

The MAH applied for the following change of indication:  
KEYTRUDA  as  monotherapy  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  urothelial 
carcinoma in adults who have received prior chemotherapy. 
KEYTRUDA  as  monotherapy  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  urothelial 
carcinoma in adults who are not eligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy. 
An  overview  of  the  current  pembrolizumab  development  plan  in  urothelial  carcinoma  is  reported  in  the 
following Table:

2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The rationale for not submitting an environmental risk assessment was provided.  
According to the “Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use” 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), pembrolizumab is exempt from preparation of an Environmental Risk 
Assessment as the product and excipients do not pose a significant risk to the environment.

Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
PD-L1 assessment in Merck Urothelial cancer Trials of Pembrolizumab 
A  cut-off  point  for  the  PD-L1  biomarker  using  the  Combined  Positive  Score  (CPS)  of  1%  and  10%  was 
established for the urothelial carcinoma program and was used in evaluation of samples from KN052 and 
KN045.  The  CPS  1%  cut-point  was  developed  based  on  data  from  KN012  and  studies  in  indications 
outside  of  the  urothelial  carcinoma  program,  and  the  CPS  10%  was  developed  based  on  a  100  patient 
training set of KN052 (biomarker discovery population). The CPS 10% cut-off point was validated in the 
remaining population for KN052 (approximately 250 subjects - validation population). 
Formaline-fixed  paraffin-embedded  (FFPE)  samples  from  the  Merck  urothelial  cancer  clinical  studies  will 
be  assessed  for  PD-L1  expression  using  the  CPS  method,  following  staining  using  the  PD-L1  IHC  22C3 
pharmDx assay. 
CPS  is  defined  as  the  percentage  of  tumour  cells  and  mononuclear  inflammatory  cells  (MIC)  within  the 
tumour  nests  and  the  adjacent  supporting  stroma  expressing  PD-L1  at  any  intensity.  The  denominator 
(all  tumour  cells)  includes  count  of  all  tumour  cells  within  the  section  determined  using  adjacent 
haematoxylin/eosin staining, independent of PD-L1 staining. The maximum of Combined Positive Score is 
defined as 100% and is represented by the equation below. 
Samples were considered PD-L1 positive if CPS ≥ 1% and strongly positive if CPS ≥ 10%). Samples were 
considered PD-L1 negative if CPS <1% (or <10)%.  
Details of the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx assay have also been submitted for NSCLC.

Analytical  validation  related  to  analytical  sensitivity  and  precision  around  the  CPS  ≥   1%  cut-off  in 
urothelial  carcinoma  specimens  was  conducted  at  Quintiles  Laboratories  (PD-L1  testing  lab  for  the 
urothelial carcinoma clinical studies) and the report was submitted as well as analytical validation related 
to precision around the CPS ≥  10% cut-off in urothelial carcinoma specimens.  
Pharmacokinetic data in UC subjects 
Sparse samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected in KEYNOTE-012 cohort C (10 mg/kg Q2W), 
KEYNOTE-052 (200 mg Q3W) and KEYNOTE-045 (200 mg Q3W).  
PK sample schedule in KN012: Pre-dose pembrolizumab serum concentrations (Ctrough) were obtained 
within 24 hours prior to dosing at Cycles 1, 2, 5, 9 and every 4 cycles (8 weeks) thereafter up to Cycle 
37. Post-dose serum concentrations (Cmax) were drawn within approximately 30 minutes after the end of 
the infusion in Cycle 1 and Cycle 2. One additional PK sample is drawn between 24 and 96 hours (1-4 
days) after Cycle 1 dosing. 
Summary statistics of the observed pembrolizumab trough (pre-dose) and post-dose concentrations in UC 
subjects from KN012 are presented in the table below:

Absorption 
Pembrolizumab is dosed via the intravenous route and therefore is immediately and completely 
bioavailable. 
Distribution 
Consistent with a limited extravascular distribution, the volume of distribution of pembrolizumab at 
steady state is small (~7.5 L; CV: 20%). As expected for an antibody, pembrolizumab does not bind to 
plasma proteins in a specific manner. 
Elimination 
The systemic clearance of pembrolizumab is ~0.2 L/day (CV: 37%) and the terminal half-life (t½) is 
~25 days (CV: 38%). 
Special populations 
The effects of various covariates on the pharmacokinetics of pembrolizumab were assessed in population 
pharmacokinetic analyses. The following factors had no clinically important effect on the clearance of 
pembrolizumab: age (range 15-94 years), gender, race, mild or moderate renal impairment, mild hepatic 
impairment and tumour burden. The relationship between body weight and clearance supports the use of 
either fixed dose or body weight-based dosing to provide adequate and similar control of exposure. 
Renal impairment 
The effect of renal impairment on the clearance of pembrolizumab was evaluated by population 
pharmacokinetic analyses in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment compared to patients with 
normal renal function. No clinically important differences in the clearance of pembrolizumab were found 
between patients with mild or moderate renal impairment and patients with normal renal function. 
Pembrolizumab has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment.

Hepatic impairment 
The effect of hepatic impairment on the clearance of pembrolizumab was evaluated by population 
pharmacokinetic analyses in patients with mild hepatic impairment (as defined using the US National 
Cancer Institute criteria of hepatic dysfunction) compared to patients with normal hepatic function. No 
clinically important differences in the clearance of pembrolizumab were found between patients with mild 
hepatic impairment and normal hepatic function. Pembrolizumab has not been studied in patients with 
moderate or severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.2 of the SmPC). 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
KEYTRUDA is an antibody that binds to the programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor and blocks its 
interaction with ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. The PD-1 receptor is a negative regulator of T-cell activity that 
has been shown to be involved in the control of T-cell immune responses. KEYTRUDA potentiates T-cell 
responses, including anti-tumour responses, through blockade of PD-1 binding to PD-L1 and PD-L2, which 
are expressed in antigen presenting cells and may be expressed by tumours or other cells in the tumour 
microenvironment. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Immunogenicity 
The samples were assayed for anti-pembrolizumab antibodies presence using a validated 
electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunoassay on the MesoScale Discovery (MSD) platform. Bioanalysis 
of pembrolizumab ADA was carried out using the standard 3-tiered assay approach that consisted of 
screening (Tier 1), confirmation (Tier 2) and antibody titer assessment (Tier 3). 
Only Tier 2 confirmed ADA positive samples were moved to Tier 3 and reported with a titer value and a 
NAb result. 
The initial neutralising assay, as used at Intertek, was a validated ligand binding ECL assay and consisted 
of two tiers: a screening tier and a confirmatory tier. 
The first tier used a cut point aiming for 5% false positives while in the second, confirmatory, tier the cut 
point allowed for 1% false positives. In the confirmatory tier, Protein G depletion was used to confirm the 
presence of pembrolizumab neutralising antibodies. The neutralising assay was subsequently redesigned 
at a second CRO (PPD). The assay was a validated ligand binding ECL assay in which the approach was 
adjusted to a single tier approach. The assay cut point was aiming for 1% false positives instead of 5%, 
supporting the elimination of a second tier. 
An integrated immunogenicity evaluation has been performed using data across studies keynote-001, -
002, -006, -012, -013, -024, -045, -052, -055, -087 and -164. A total of 3727 subjects were included in 
the immunogenicity assessment across indications (1535 melanoma, 1238 NSCLC, 101 HNSCC, 45 MSI-
H, 220 HL and 579 UC) and across doses (at 2 mg/kg Q3W, 10 mg/kg Q3W/Q2W and 200 mg Q3W).  
Out of the 3727 subjects included in the immunogenicity assessment, 2034 subjects were evaluable.  
The observed incidence of treatment emergent ADA in evaluable subjects based on the pooled analysis is 
1.8% (36 out of 2034). Of the 36 treatment emergent positive subjects, 9 (1 melanoma, 5 NSCLC, 1 HL

and 2 UC) tested positive in the neutralizing assay. The 9 subjects positive in the neutralising assay 
accounted for a total incidence rate of treatment neutralizing positive subjects of 0.4% (9 out of 2034) in 
the overall population. 
A summary of subject immunogenicity results is reported below: 
Pembrolizumab exposure for these treatment emergent (ADA and neutralizing) subjects was within the 
same range of exposure observed for other non-positive subjects treated with the same regimen. 
Evaluation of drug tolerance level 
At the recommended dosing regimen of 200 mg, the pembrolizumab concentration in the last post-dose 
sample was below the drug tolerance level (<DTL) for about 92.9% of the subjects, indicating that the 
DLT for the ADA assay is adequate  for 200 mg.

2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
Previously, a pooled population PK analysis (report 04DDV3) using KN001, KN002 and KN006 studies was 
performed to characterise serum concentrations over time based on a dataset including 2188 subjects 
across the melanoma and NSCLC indications. This analysis is considered the definitive population PK 
analysis to characterize pembrolizumab PK and inform the label for pembrolizumab.  
The structure of the definitive population PK model for pembrolizumab has a two-compartment model 
structure with a linear clearance from the central compartment, parameterized in terms of clearance (CL), 
inter-compartmental clearance (Q), central compartment volume of distribution (Vc), and peripheral 
compartment volume of distribution (Vp). All PK parameters were allometrically scaled based on body 
weight with separate exponents estimated for the clearance (CL, Q) and volume (Vc, Vp) parameters, as 
follows:  
where θx is a typical value of a pharmacokinetic parameter P*, and θy is the fixed-effect parameter to be 
estimated. WT is the individual body weight, and Median  
WT is the median body weight across the analysis population.  
In addition to body weight, the existing population PK model contained several more covariate 
relationships, which were established through a stepwise covariate search. The covariate relationships 
used the following generic form for continuous covariates, similar to the relationships for body weight. 
The following function was used to describe the effects of categorical covariates: 
Where θx is a typical value of a pharmacokinetic parameter P*, and θy is the fixed-effect parameter to be 
estimated, and Cov is the (continuous) covariate value and Q is the indicator variable denoting the 
category of the (categorical) covariate. 
Specifically, the following covariates were included in the model: 
Assessment report  
EMA/512404/2017 
Page 22/146 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
In this model, the impact of these covariates on pembrolizumab exposure was limited (generally less than 
20%) and therefore was not considered to be of clinical relevance. 
Nevertheless, these covariates have been maintained in the model and re-estimated on the extended 
dataset. Of note, in establishing the final model on the new dataset, the covariate cancer type was 
reassessed. The covariate cancer type was redefined in the model in order to have a single category 
represent the existing (melanoma and NSCLC) dataset to allow comparison of the newly added UC 
indication. 
Upon reassessment of the impact of cancer type (categorised as UC or Melanoma+NSCLC+other), a 
statistically significant effect of the covariate was observed on clearance, representing an increased 
clearance (by 14.6%) in UC patients relative to the non- UC patients. 
Inter-individual variability (IIV) of the PK parameters (CL, Volume of distributions (Vc and Vp) and inter-
compartmental clearance Q) was included using a log-normal random effects model. 
Residual variability (RV), a composite measure of assay error, dose/sample time collection errors, model 
misspecification, and any other unexplained variability within a subject, was modelled using a log-
transformed additive error model (for the Assessment of the population PK analysis, please refer to the 
variation II/11 of Keytruda).  
No additional model development was performed in the current analysis, and the definitive population PK 
was used as is. For this updated PK evaluation, the data from UC patients from studies KN012, KN052 
and KN045 were added to the dataset. Therefore, the consistency of pembrolizumab PK in patients with 
UC from studies KN012, KN052 and KN045 with the established definitive population PK analysis was 
analysed. The model was used to predict pembrolizumab levels in UC patients after 200 mg Q3W and 10 
mg/kg Q2W and the predictions were compared with observed levels determined in studies KN012, 
KN052 and KN045. 
The final analysis dataset from studies KN001, KN002, KN006, KN052, KN012 cohort C and KN045 used 
for the population PK comprised of a total of 14976 pembrolizumab concentrations from 2794 patients, of 
which 2743 PK observations were from 606 UC patients. The number of subjects and PK observations by 
dose in the pooled analysis dataset are provided in the following table:

Pharmacokinetic in target population 
In support of this specific submission, a focused PK analysis was conducted primarily to show the 
similarity of observed concentrations in subjects with UC in KN012 (10 mg/kg Q2W), KN052 and KN045 
(200 mg Q3W) with the predictions from the definitive population PK analysis.   
Comparison UC vs Other Indications 
The existing population PK model for pembrolizumab was used to re-estimate the PK-parameters for the 
complete updated dataset (including data from UC patients from studies KN012, KN052 and KN045).  
Following finalisation of the population PK model on the pooled dataset, the final model was used to 
enable comparisons of the pharmacokinetics of pembrolizumab between UC subjects and those from 
other indications.  
Comparison of parameter estimates of the final model using the integrated dataset (i.e. KN001, KN002, 
KN006, KN012, KN045 and KN052) and the dataset used in previous pop PK model (Pooled Protocol 
KN001, KN002 and KN006 Dataset) is shown in the table below:

Additionally, the observed exposures for UC subjects receiving the 200 mg Q3W regimen were compared 
to prior data at 2 mg/kg Q3W and 10 mg/kg Q2W in melanoma and NSCLC subjects: 
When assessed specifically for line of therapy (first line / second line) the exposures at 200 mg Q3W in 
UC subjects are similar to those from other indications at the same regimen.

The MAH provided additional comparison of the observed PK data (trough and peak concentrations at 
each cycle) with those obtained with the 200 mg Q3W flat dose for UC and non-UC patients (1L NSCLC 
and HL) by means of tabular summaries of descriptive statistics and boxplots.  Exposure reached in 
patients with UC is consistent with other indications at the same dose level. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The starting point for the population PK analysis submitted in this variation application was the previous 
population  PK  analysis  04DDV3  based  on  dataset  including  2188  subjects  across  the  melanoma  and 
NSCLC  indications  (KN001,  KN002  and  KN006  studies).  This  analysis  is  considered  the  definitive 
population  PK  model  to  inform  the  label  for  pembrolizumab  and  no  further  model  development  was 
performed  in  the  current  analysis  which  incorporates  data  from  UC  patients  recruited  in  studies  KN012 
(Cohort C), KN045 (second line) and  KN052 (first line cisplatin ineligible).  
Thus, the final dataset consists of a total of 14976 determinations of pembrolizumab concentrations from 
2794 patients (606 UC out of 2794).  
Assessment report  
EMA/512404/2017 
Page 29/146 
 
  
  
 
 
The  approach  taken  was  to  utilise  the  definitve  population  PK  model  to  predict  pembrolizumab  levels  in 
UC patients after 200 mg Q3W and 10 mg/kg Q2W. The predictions were compared with observed levels 
determined in studies KN012 (Cohort C), KN045 and  KN052. 
Overall, the model proved adequate to capture pembrolizumab concentration indicating that the definitive 
population PK model provides an adequate representation of the pembrolizumab pharmacokinetics in UC, 
in addition to melanoma and NSCLC.  
Observed plasma concentration in UC subjects both during the first dose (10 mg/kg or 200 mg Q3W) and 
at  steady  state  after  repeated  doses  (10  mg/kg  or  200  mg  Q3W)  fall  within  the  range  of  predicted 
concentration showing consistency in exposure between UC and other indications. 
The  PK  report  and  the  evaluation  of  studies  KN012,  KN045  and  KN052  include  descriptive  statistics  of 
serum concentration values of pembrolizumab following administration of multiple I.V 200 mg Q3W in UC 
patients and multiple 2 mg/kg I.V doses Q3W in KN001 melanoma and NSCLC patients. 
Comparisons  of  peak  and  trough  concentrations  between  indications  showed  that  Pembrolizumab  serum 
concentrations in cycle 1, 2 and 8 observed at 200 mg Q3W in UC patients are slightly higher compared 
to the range of concentrations at dose levels of 2 mg/kg Q3W observed in MEL and NSCLC patients.  
The  data  presented  showed  that  this  difference  in  pembrolizumab  concentration  (higher  value  in  UC 
patients after 200 mg Q3W compared to MEL and NSCLC after 2 mg/kg Q3W) is mainly evident in study 
KN045 (second line).  
Generally, considering the flat relationship between dose and exposure, it is considerate unlikely that this 
difference could lead to a significant clinical effect. 
However,  all comparisons were  made  with  other  indications approved  with the  weight  based  dose 
regimen  of 2  mg/kg,  thus  excluding indications approved  with  the flat dose of  200mg  Q3W such  us  1L 
NSCLC  and  HL.  Similarly,  the  Boxplot  reporting  pembrolizumab exposure  across  indications  did  not 
consider the 200 mg Q3W dosing in 1L NSCLC (study KN024) and HL (study KN087).   
Additional  comparison  of  the  observed  PK  data  were  provided  (trough  and  peak  concentrations  at  each 
cycle) with those obtained with the 200 mg Q3W flat dose for UC and non-UC patients (1L NSCLC and HL) 
by means of tabular summaries of descriptive statistics and boxplots.  
The  available  concentrations  after  administration  of  the  fixed  dose  of  200  mg  Q3W  for  UC  patients 
(KEYNOTE-052  and  -45)  were  compared  with  those  observed  for  1L  NSCLC  patients    (KN024),  and  cHL 
patients  (KN087)  for  each  cycle  by  time  point.  Exposure  reached  in  patients  with  UC  is  consistent  with 
other indications at the same dose level. 
Moreover, a difference was observed in the PK profile of Pembrolizumab in UC patients when considering 
1L  and  2L  studies  separately,  with  lower  exposure  (AUC_ss)  achieved  in  the  first-line  study  KN052.  To 
better  address  the  comparability  among  UC  patients  and  among  other  indications,  Pembrolizumab  (MK-
3475) Exposure (AUC) Across Indications at Clinically Tested Doses in linear scale was provided.  
As  requested,  the  applicant  elaborated  on  the  comparison  of  PK  in  UC  vs  non-UC  and  among  both  UC 
patient groups (1L, 2L). PK differences that have been detected are deemed to be minor.  
An  integrated  immunogenicity  evaluation  has  been  performed  using  data  across  studies  keynote-001,  -
002, -006, -012, -013, -024, -045, -052, -055, -087 and -164. A total of 3727 subjects were included in 
the immunogenicity assessment across indications (1535 melanoma, 1238 NSCLC, 101 HNSCC, 45 MSI-
H, 220 HL and 579 UC) and across doses (at 2 mg/kg Q3W, 10 mg/kg Q3W/Q2W and 200 mg Q3W). Out 
of  the  3727  subjects  included  in  the  immunogenicity  assessment,  2034  subjects  were  evaluable.  The 
observed  incidence  of  treatment  emergent  ADA  in  evaluable  subjects  based  on  the  pooled  analysis  is 
1.8% (36 out of 2034). Of the 36 treatment emergent positive subjects, 9 (1 melanoma, 5 NSCLC, 1 HL 
Assessment report  
EMA/512404/2017 
Page 30/146 
 
  
  
and  2  UC)  tested  positive  in  the  neutralizing  assay.  The  9  subjects  positive  in  the  neutralizing  assay 
accounted for a total incidence rate of treatment neutralizing positive subjects of 0.4% (9 out of 2034) in 
the overall population. 
The incidence of treatment emergent ADA in subjects with UC is comparable to the overall incidence and 
consistent  with  other  indications.  No  impact  of  binding  or  neutralizing  ADA  on  pembrolizumab  exposure 
was observed. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacology data submitted are considered appropriate and supportive for this application.   
2.4.  Clinical efficacy

urothelial carcinoma both for patients who have received prior chemotherapy and for those who are not 
eligible  for  cisplatin-containing  chemotherapy,  two  single  pivotal  studies,  each  including  patients  in  the 
two specific settings, have been submitted:  
1.  Study  KEYNOTE-045,  in  a  second-line  setting  for  patients  who  progressed  following  treatment 
with platinum-containing chemotherapy, and  
2.  Study  KEYNOTE-052  in  patients  previously  untreated  and  not  eligible  to  cisplatin-containing 
chemotherapy.

2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
A fixed-dose regimen of pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W is administered in both pivotal studies for the 
treatment of urothelial carcinoma (UC). Thirty-three patients with heavily pre-treated urinary tract cancer 
received pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg Q2W in the phase Ib multi-cohort study KEYNOTE-012. Among the 
overall 27 patients PD-L1 ≥1% assessable for activity, an overall response rate of 26%, including 11% of 
complete responses (by independent central review per RECIST 1.1), was achieved. Overall, the median 
duration of response was 10 months, with 2 CR still ongoing after 13 months of median follow up 
(Plimack E R, et al Lancet Oncol 2017; 18:212-220). 
An integrated body of evidence suggests that 200 mg Q3W of pembrolizumab provides similar response 
to 2 mg/kg Q3W, 10 mg/kg Q3W, and 10 mg/kg Q2W. 
Overall, the clinical data in urothelial carcinoma subjects, demonstrating efficacy at 200 mg Q3W and 
similarity of clinical response over a wide dose range (200 mg flat dose to 10 mg/kg), in conjunction with 
an integrated body of evidence in melanoma and NSCLC patients, support the use of pembrolizumab 200 
mg Q3W fixed-dose as the appropriate dosing for urothelial carcinoma (see Section 2.3.4).

versus Paclitaxel, Docetaxel or Vinflunine in Subjects with Recurrent or 
Progressive Metastatic Urothelial Cancer  
Figure: Trial design 
Note: The overall proportion of subjects receiving vinflunine in the control arm was initially planned to be 
capped at approximately 35%, however, the cap was never implemented. Vinflunine was only a 
comparator option in countries where vinflunine is approved for the treatment of metastatic urothelial 
cancer. Docetaxel was only a comparator option for subjects with a total bilirubin ≤1 x ULN, and an AST 
≤ 1.5 x ULN if alkaline phosphatase is also >2.5 x ULN. 
Methods 
Study participants 
Main inclusion criteria 
•  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of urothelial cancer of the renal pelvis, ureter, 
bladder, or urethra. Both transitional cell and mixed transitional/nontransitional cell histologies 
were allowed, but transitional cell carcinoma had to be the predominant histology. 
•  Age ≥18 years 
• 
Progression or recurrence of urothelial cancer following receipt of a 1st line platinum-containing 
regimen (eg, cisplatin or carboplatin) that was received: 
a. in the metastatic setting or for inoperable locally advanced disease;  
or 
Assessment report  
EMA/512404/2017 
Page 33/146 
 
  
  
 
 
b. as adjuvant therapy following cystectomy for localized muscle-invasive urothelial cancer, with 
recurrence/progression ≤ 12 months following completion of therapy;  
or 
c. as neoadjuvant therapy prior to cystectomy for localized muscle-invasive urothelial cancer, with 
recurrence ≤ 12 months following completion of therapy. 
Notes: Primary chemo-radiation given for subjects who were not considered surgical candidates was not 
considered a line of therapy for the purpose of this study.  Subjects with locally advanced unresectable 
disease who subsequently became eligible for surgery after platinum-containing therapy were not eligible 
for this study, unless they subsequently had disease recurrence in the metastatic setting. 
•  No more than 2 prior lines of systemic chemotherapy for metastatic urothelial cancer. Subjects 
for whom the most recent therapy was a non-platinum-based regimen following 
progression/recurrence on platinum-based therapy (ie, third-line subjects) were eligible if they 
had progressed/recurred on their most recent therapy. 
Note: primary chemo-radiation for unresectable muscle-invasive bladder cancer with the aim of bladder 
preservation was not considered a prior line of systemic therapy for the purposes of determining study 
eligibility. 
• 
Provided tissue for biomarker analysis from an archival tissue sample or newly obtained core or 
excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion not previously irradiated. A newly-obtained biopsy was 
strongly preferred but not required if archival tissue was adequate for analysis. Adequacy of the 
archived or freshly-obtained biopsy specimen had to be confirmed by the central laboratory 
during the screening period prior to enrollment. 
•  Measureable disease based on RECIST 1.1 as assessed by the Investigator/site radiologist. Tumor 
lesions situated in a previously irradiated area were considered measureable if progression had 
been demonstrated in such lesions. 
•  ECOG Performance Status of 0, 1, or 2, as assessed within 10 days prior to treatment initiation. 
Subjects with an ECOG-PS of 2 had to have a hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dL, could not have liver 
metastases, and must have received the last dose of their last prior chemotherapy regimen ≥ 3

Notes: Subjects with ≤  Grade 2 neuropathy or ≤  Grade 2 alopecia are an exception to this criterion and 
could qualify for the study.  If a subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately 
from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy. 
•  Known additional malignancy progressing or requiring active treatment. Exceptions included basal 
cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that had undergone potentially 
curative therapy, or in situ cervical cancer. A history of prostate cancer identified incidentally 
following cysto-prostatectomy for bladder cancer was acceptable, provided that Stage was  
T2N0M0 or lower, Gleason score ≤ 6, and prostate-specific antigen undetectable. 
•  History of severe hypersensitivity reaction (eg, generalized rash/erythema, hypotension, 
bronchospasm, angioedema, or anaphylaxis) to paclitaxel or to other drugs formulated with 
polyoxyethylated castor oil, to docetaxel or other drugs formulated with polysorbate 80, or to 
vinflunine or other vinca alkaloids. 
•  History or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that could 
confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject’s participation for the full duration of

previously-treated brain metastases could participate provided they are stable (without evidence 
of progression by imaging for at least 4 weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any 
neurologic symptoms had returned to baseline), had no evidence of new or enlarging brain 
metastases, and were not using steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment. This exception 
did not include carcinomatous meningitis, which was excluded regardless of clinical stability. 
•  Active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment within the past 3 months or a 
documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease, or a syndrome that required 
systemic or immunosuppressive agents. Subjects with vitiligo, Type I diabetes, or resolved 
childhood asthma/atopy could be an exception to this rule. Subjects who required intermittent 
use of bronchodilators, inhaled steroids, or local steroid injections were not excluded from the 
study. Subjects with hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement or Sjögren’s syndrome 
were not excluded from the study.

Treatments 
• 
• 
Pembrolizumab 200 mg administered as a 30 minute (-5 min/+10 min) IV infusion Q3W. 
Investigator’s choice:  
o  paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 administered over 1 hours IV infusion Q3W  
o  docetaxel 75 mg/m2 administered over 1 hour IV infusion Q3W  
o  vinflunine 320 mg/m2 administered as a 20 minute IV infusion Q3W 
The  appropriate  premedication  regimen  prior  to  paclitaxel  and  docetaxel  administration  may  be 
determined by the investigator. 
In case of mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≥ 1.25 × ULN), paclitaxel was to be started at a dose 
of 135 mg/m2.  
Docetaxel was a comparator option only for subjects with a total bilirubin ≤ 1 × ULN, and an AST and/or 
ALT ≤ 1.5 × ULN if alkaline phosphatase was also > 2.5 × ULN. 
Vinflunine was only a comparator option in countries where vinflunine was approved for the treatment of 
metastatic urothelial cancer. Vinflunine starting dose was to be modified in the following cases: 
ECOG-PS≥ 1 or ECOG-PS 0 and prior pelvic irradiation 
280 mg/m² Q3W 
In the absence of any hematological toxicity 
during the first cycle causing treatment delay

subject had received 24 months of pembrolizumab treatment or administrative reasons.  
Despite  RECIST  1.1  defined  progression,  pembrolizumab  could  have  been  continued  while  awaiting 
radiologic  confirmation  of  PD.    If  repeat  imaging  still  meets  the  threshold  for  PD  (≥  20%  increase  in 
tumor burden compared to nadir) but shows a reduction in tumor burden compared to the previous time 
point, treatment may be continued as per treatment calendar after consultation with Sponsor. 
Patients  who  stopped  pembrolizumab  after  receiving  24  months  of  treatment  for  reasons  other  than 
disease  progression  or  intolerability,  or  after  a  complete  response  having  received  at  least  24  weeks  of 
pembrolizumab and at least 2 treatments beyond the date of initial CR declared, may have been eligible, 
at discretion of the investigator, for up to one year of retreatment upon experiencing disease progression 
(Second Course Phase).  
Patients  in  the  experimental  arm  were  allowed  to  stay  on  treatment  after  PD  based  on  RECIST  1.1  to 
account  for  pseudo-progressions  and  delayed  responses.  Overall,  98  patients  were  treated  beyond  first 
radiographic progression, and treatment was continued in 40% of them, including 17 patients who were 
not confirmed to be in progression and 22 patients with confirmed radiographic progression.  
Objectives 
The study primary objective was to demonstrate the superiority of pembrolizumab versus Investigator's 
choice (paclitaxel, docetaxel or vinflunine) in terms of Progression Free Survival (PFS) per RECIST 1.1 by 
blinded independent central review (BICR), and of Overall Survival (OS) in all subjects with 
recurrent/progressive after platinum-based chemotherapy metastatic urothelial cancer, as well as in 
those with PD-L1 positive (CPS≥1%) and PD-L1 strongly positive (CPS≥10%) tumors.  
The trial was considered to have met its primary objective if the pembrolizumab arm was superior to 
paclitaxel, docetaxel, or vinflunine in any of the following: 
•  H1: PFS in all subjects (regardless of PD-L1 expression) 
•  H2: OS in all subjects (regardless of PD-L1 expression) 
•  H3: PFS in subjects with PD-L1 positive expression (CPS≥1%) 
•  H4: OS in subjects with PD-L1 positive expression (CPS≥1%) 
•  H5: PFS in subjects with PD-L1 strongly positive expression (CPS≥10%) 
•  H6: OS in subjects with PD-L1 strongly positive expression (CPS≥10%) 
As secondary objectives, Objective Response Rate (ORR) and response duration per RECIST 1.1 by BICR, 
ORR per modified RECIST (mRECIST) by BICR, PFS per mRECIST by BICR and per RECIST 1.1 from 
randomization to specific timepoints (6 months, 12 months), and safety and tolerability profile of 
pembrolizumab compared to Investigator's choice were evaluated in all subjects, as well as in those with 
PD-L1 positive (CPS≥1%) and PD-L1 strongly positive (CPS≥10%) recurrent/progressive metastatic 
urothelial cancer. 
Other exploratory objectives were to evaluate changes in health-related quality of life assessment from 
baseline (eEORTC QLQ-C30), to characterize utilities (eEQ-5D), to investigate the relationship between 
Assessment report  
EMA/512404/2017

PD-L1 expression and response to pembrolizumab treatment, as well as between pembrolizumab 
treatment and biomarkers predicting response (eg, immunohistochemistry, proteomic signatures, genetic 
variation, and gene expression signatures) utilizing newly obtained or archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-
embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue, and to evaluate PFS per RECIST 1.1 by Investigator review in the next 
line of therapy in patients treated with pembrolizumab in comparison to those who received paclitaxel, 
docetaxel or vinflunine. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The dual primary efficacy endpoints were PFS (i.e. time from randomization to the first documented 
disease progression per RECIST 1.1 based on BICR or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first), 
and OS (i.e. time from randomization to death due to any cause).  
As secondary endpoints, ORR per RECIST 1.1 and mRECIST by BICR, duration response per RECIST 1.1 
by BICR and PFS per mRECIST were evaluated. 
ORR was defined as the proportion of the subjects in the analysis population who have a confirmed 
complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), based upon blinded independent central radiologists’ 
review per RECIST 1.1.  
Response duration was defined as the time from first documented evidence of confirmed CR or PR until 
disease progression or death. For subjects who had not progressed or died at the time of analysis, 
response duration was censored at the date of their last tumor assessment.  
PFS and ORR per mRECIST were defined as for endpoints using RECIST 1.1, with the exception that a 
confirmation of progressive disease (PD) at least 4 weeks after the initial assessment was required for 
subjects who remained on treatment following a documented PD per RECIST 1.1. Subjects who 
discontinued treatment following a documented PD assessment per RECIST 1.1 were counted as having 
disease progression on the date of the documented PD assessment. 
The assessment of response was performed initially at Week 9 (±7days), then every 6 weeks (±7 days) 
for the first year and every 12 weeks (±7 days) thereafter. Images obtained on study were submitted for 
BICR and were assessed based on the RECIST 1.1 for determination of ORR and PFS. Investigator/local 
site assessment of measurable disease, based on RECIST 1.1, was used to determine subject eligibility. 
Investigator assessment based on modified RECIST and site radiology reading(s) was used for treatment 
decisions and subject management.  
Among the planned exploratory endpoints, results have been submitted for EORTC QLQ-C30 and 
EUROQoL EQ-5D. No formal hypotheses were formulated for PRO.  
The global health status/quality of life scale from EORTC QLQ-C30, containing 5 functioning scales 
(physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea, pain), and six single 
item measures (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties), was 
the key PRO endpoint, in particular in terms of mean score changes from baseline to week 15 and Time to 
deterioration (TTD), measured as the time point when the score decreases by ≥10 (out of 100), with or 
without subsequent confirmation. Supportive analyses included all QLQ-C30 sub-scales/items and 
alternative approaches such as estimating the effect of disease progression on HRQoL.

Sample size 
The trial planned to randomize 470 subjects in a 1:1 ratio between pembrolizumab and the standard 
treatment arm. The sample size calculation was driven by survival events. Assuming the prevalence rates 
of PD-L1 CPS ≥1% and PD-L1 CPS ≥10% subjects among the overall population of 55% and 33%, 
respectively, a sample size of 470 all subjects would provide approximately 260 PD-L1 CPS ≥1% subjects 
and 156 PD-L1 CPS ≥10% subjects. 
The assumptions for the sample size and power calculation of PFS were that PFS follows an exponential 
distribution with a median of 4 months in the standard treatment arm; the true HR between 
pembrolizumab and standard therapy are 0.45, 0.5, and 0.5 for PD-L1 CPS ≥10%, PD-L1 CPS ≥1%, and 
all subjects, respectively; an enrollment period of 12 months; and a yearly drop-out rate of 5%.  
Based on information from study KEYNOTE-052, indicating that the PD-L1 CPS ≥ 10% cutpoint is more 
meaningful than CPS ≥ 1% used in KEYNOTE-012, the study protocol was amended after IA1, and only 
the primary hypotheses for all comers and subjects with PD-L1 CPS >10% were retained. 
The numbers of PFS events in PD-L1 CPS ≥ 10% and all subjects at the final PFS evaluation were 
estimated to be 137 and 420, respectively, with 97% power for the PFS hypothesis in PD-L1 CPS ≥ 10% 
subjects and >99% power for the PFS hypothesis in all subjects. 
The sample size and power calculation of OS are based on the assumptions that OS follows an 
exponential distribution with a median of 8 months in the standard treatment arm; the hazard ratio for 
OS between pembrolizumab and standard treatment is 0.5, 0.6, and 0.7 for PD-L1 CPS ≥ 10%, PD-L1 
CPS ≥ 1%, and all subjects, respectively (deemed to be clinically meaningful in this population); an 
enrollment period of 12 months and a minimum of 18 months follow-up after enrollment completion; and 
a yearly drop-out rate of 2%.  
The final OS analysis was to be carried out after approximately 370 deaths in all subjects and 110 deaths 
in PD-L1 CPS ≥10% subjects had occurred between the pembrolizumab arm and the standard treatment 
arm for all subjects, barring early stopping for futility or efficacy. With the above numbers of events and 
before any alpha roll-over, the trial provides 88% and 86% power to demonstrate OS superiority of 
pembrolizumab compared to standard therapy at the pre-specified initial alpha (one-sided) levels in PD-
L1 CPS ≥10% and all subjects, respectively.  
The family-wise type I error rate is controlled at 2.5% (one-sided) with 0.5% allocated to the PFS 
hypotheses and 2.0% allocated to the OS hypotheses.  
Randomisation 
Randomization (1:1) to pembrolizumab or the Investigator’s choice (paclitaxel, docetaxel, or vinflunine) 
occurred centrally with block size of 2 within each of strata, using an interactive voice response 
system/integrated web response system (IVRS/IWRS). Investigators had to select 1 treatment among the 
control arm options before randomization occurred to use in the event that the subject was randomized 
to the control arm. 
Randomized patients were stratified according to ECOG-PS (0/1 versus 2), presence or absence of liver 
metastases, Hemoglobin (≥10 g/dL versus <10 g/dL), and time from completion of most recent 
chemotherapy (<3 months or ≥3 months).

Blinding (masking) 
Not applicable. This was an open label trial. 
However, in order to ensure the unbiased use/ integrity of the PD-L1 analysis, the Medical Monitoring 
Team, consisting of clinical, statistical, statistical programming, and data management personnel, was 
blinded to treatment assignments and PD-L1 biomarker results (including CPS ≥1%), until the Cut-off 
value of PD-L1 expression level for CPS ≥10% was established and formally documented exclusively 
based on data outside of this trial.  
Statistical methods 
Efficacy analyses were performed in the ITT population for all subjects, for subjects with CPS ≥ 10%, and 
for subjects with CPS ≥ 1% (only at the first interim analysis).  
The treatment difference in PFS and OS was assessed by the stratified log-rank test. A stratified Cox 
proportional hazard model with Efron's method of tie handling was used to assess the magnitude of the 
treatment difference (i.e. hazard ratio) between the treatment arms.  
In the PFS primary analysis, for the subjects who have PD, the true date of disease progression was 
approximated by the date of the first assessment at which PD is objectively documented per RECIST 1.1, 
regardless of discontinuation of study drug. Sensitivity analyses were performed for comparison of PFS 
based on investigator's assessment. In order to evaluate the robustness of the PFS endpoint, two 
sensitivity analyses with a different set of censoring rules were performed. The first sensitivity analysis 
censors at the last disease assessment without PD when PD or death is documented after more than one 
missed disease assessment. The second sensitivity analysis considers discontinuation of treatment or 
initiation of new anticancer treatment, whichever occurs later, to be a PD event for subjects without 
documented PD or death.  
For the objective response rates (ORR) the Stratified Miettinen and Nurminen’s method was used for 
comparison between the treatment groups. Sensitivity analyses were performed for comparison of ORR 
based on investigator's assessment and multiple imputation methods was considered to address the issue 
of informative missing data. 
Response duration was summarised descriptively using Kaplan-Meier medians and quartiles. Only the 
subset of subjects who show a complete response or partial response was included in this analysis.  
Longitudinal and descriptive data analyses were used to evaluate patient-reported outcomes (PRO). 
Several approaches were considered to address the issue of informative missing data: (1) truncating the 
analysis observation period at the visit closest to median duration of treatment in the comparator arm, 
(2) hierarchical pattern mixture models incorporating reasons for missingness, and (3) multiple 
imputation methods. 
Interim Analyses 
There were two planned PFS analyses and three planned OS analyses. Results of the first PFS analysis 
and the interim analysis of OS were to be reviewed by an external data monitoring committee (DMC). 
Timing, sample size and boundaries for decision guidance are displayed in the Table below.   
The second interim analyses of OS was planned to be performed about 8 months after the first PFS 
analysis. The final OS analysis will be conducted after ~356 OS events are observed at the alpha level 
determined by the spending function boundaries and actual number of OS events.

Summary of Timing, Sample Size and Decision Guidance at the Planned PFS and OS Analyses 
Multiplicity Adjustment 
The family-wise type I error rate is controlled at 2.5% (one-sided) with 0.5% allocated to the PFS 
hypothesis and 2.0% allocated to the OS hypothesis. A strategy for the control of the family-wise type I 
error rate (FWER) was done to take into account the six primary hypotheses (two primary endpoints and 
three population) and the two planned interim analyses.  
The alpha initially allocated among the six hypotheses, and the reallocation strategy according to the 
method of Maurer and Bretz, are displayed in the Figure below.  
Assessment report  
EMA/512404/2017 
Page 41/146 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
For each analysis (IA1, IA2 and final), alpha allocation was determined by applying a Hwang-Shih-DeCani 
alpha-spending function with the gamma parameter (-4). 
As the biomarker strategy was changed (Amendment 13) and the hypotheses on PD-L1 positive (CPS 
≥1%) were not be formally tested at the second interim analysis and the final analysis, the alpha 
allocation was revised accordingly to reflect the change in biomarker strategy. The reallocation of alpha 
occurred after the conduct of IA1. The type I error actually spent at IA1 was to be kept intact and the 
reallocation was to be applied only to the remaining unspent alpha, by first applying the same HSD 
gamma (-4) spending function and then updated based on the actual numbers of events (information 
fraction) and alpha roll-over.  
The secondary hypotheses on PFS (modified RECIST 1.1), ORR (RECIST 1.1) and ORR (modified RECIST 
1.1), were tested sequentially with alpha level depending on the alpha roll-over. The updated efficacy 
boundaries after taking into consideration of all alpha rollovers are summarized in the Table (see below).

Recruitment 
Overall, 542 patients were enrolled in 120 out of the 140 activated sites. The recruitment period lasted 1 
year, with the first patient entered on 23 October 2014 and the last one randomized on 13 November 
2015. The highest enrolling country was the US with a total of 105 subjects. 
Conduct of the study 
A total of 14 amendments to the original protocol (dated 23 Jun 2014), including global and country-
specific changes, were implemented during the study.  
The key changes introduced by the protocol amendments are summarized below: 
Protocol Amendment 
Most relevant changes 
#01 (1 August 2014) 
Country specific (Germany): the timing for follow-up radiographic 
imaging was changed to every 12 weeks (±7 days) following the 
initial radiographic assessment at 9 weeks or sooner if clinically 
indicated. 
#2 (26 August 2014) 
To include docetaxel as a comparator in the control arm. 
# 3 (28 August 2014) 
Country specific (Germany): to incorporate modifications as for 
Amendment #2. 
To incorporate the agency feedback and to update the statistical 
analysis plan, including elevating PFS and OS in subjects with PD-
#4  (not released) 
L1 positive and PD-L1 strongly positive tumors to co-primary 
objectives. Due to a change in the biomarker strategy, this 
amendment was not released to the Health Authorities. 
#5 (not released) 
Country specific (Germany): to incorporate modifications as for 
Amendment #4. 
#6 (15 January 2015) 
therapy with medications that are strong inducers of the CYP3A4 
Country specific (UK): to exclude subjects who required ongoing 
enzymes. 
#7 (20 February 2015) 
Country specific (France): to incorporate as Appendix the current 
Event of Clinical Interest (ECI) Guidance Document (18-Dec-2014 
#8 (not released) 
Country specific (France): to incorporate modifications as for 
Amendment #4. 
#9 (27 February 2016) 
To include the planned changes for Amendment 04: incorporated 
agency feedback, and PFS and OS in subjects with PD-L1 positive 
(CPS ≥ 1%) and PD-L1 strongly positive tumors as co-primary 
objectives due to emerging evidence suggesting that PD-L1 status 
may correlate to outcomes. In addition, the statistical analysis 
plan was updated throughout to reflect the incorporation of the 
analyses of the primary hypotheses on PD-L1 positive (CPS ≥ 1%) 
Assessment report  
EMA/512404/2017 
Page 44/146 
 
  
  
 
 
and PD-L1 strongly positive subjects. 
#10 (10 March 2016) 
Country specific (Germany): to incorporate modifications as for 
Amendment #9. 
#11 (26 May 2016) 
To update the statistical analysis plan to account for the number 
of events in the PD-L1 positive (CPS ≥ 1%) subjects in timing and 
conduct of the interim and final analysis, because most of the 
alpha for testing OS was allocated to the PD-L1 positive(CPS 
≥ 1%) biomarker subgroup. The statistical analysis plan was also 
updated to account for the possible postponement of the second 
interim analysis and/or the final analysis for up to 4 additional 
months to accrue enough OS events in the PD-L1 positive (CPS 
≥ 1%) subjects after the planned number of OS events in all 
subjects is achieved. 
#12 (21 June 2016) 
Country specific (Germany): to incorporate modifications as for 
Amendment #11. 
#13 (19 September 2016) 
To clarify that the basis for PD-L1 positive and strongly positive 
categories using CPS cutpoints was determined from external 
data (ie, KEYNOTE-012, KEYNOTE-052, and epidemiologic 
studies).  
The biomarker strategy was changed based on these emerging 
data. Primary hypotheses on PD-L1 positive (CPS ≥ 1%) subjects 
would not be formally tested at the second interim analysis and 
the final analysis. Alpha allocation among the primary hypotheses 
for interim and final analyses was revised accordingly to reflect 
the change in biomarker strategy. The reallocation of alpha occurs 
after the conduct of IA1, and proper adjustment was made to 
maintain the control of family-wise type I error rate (FWER) with 
implementation of this change 
#14 (19 September 2016) 
Country specific (Germany): to incorporate modifications as for 
Amendment #13. 
Clinically relevant protocol deviations were reported in a total of 28 patients, and concerned entry criteria 
(16 patients), discontinuation criteria (1 patient), and prohibited medication (11 patients). No subject was 
excluded from the analysis due to protocol deviation.

Numbers analysed 
The ITT population, including all randomized subjects in the treatment group to which they were assigned 
(270 in the pembrolizumab arm and 272 in the control arm), served as the primary efficacy analysis 
population.  
For the analysis of pre-specified key exploratory PRO endpoints, a specific Full Analysis Set (FAS) 
population, that consisted of all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study medication 
and completed at least one PRO instrument (266 subjects in the pembrolizumab arm and 254 subjects in 
the control arm), was considered. 
The All Subject as Treated (ASaT) population, defined as all randomized subjects who received at least 
one dose of study treatment (266 in the pembrolizumab arm and 255 in the control arm) was used for 
the analysis of safety data.

Outcomes and estimation 
Results from the second interim analysis (cut-off date 07-Sep-2016) were provided for primary (PFS and 
OS) and secondary (ORR, DOR, and PFS/ORR per mRECIST) endpoints.  Even if, based on external 
biomarker data only primary hypotheses of all comers and PD-L1 CPS ≥ 10% were included in the 
multiplicity-controlled statistical testing for the IA2, results in subjects with CPS ≥ 1% are also reported 
although p-value was not multiplicity-adjusted. 
The median follow up duration was 10.3 (range 0.2 to 20.8) months in the pembrolizumab arm and 7.9 
(range 0.3 to 20.3) months in the control arm.

An updated analysis (cut-off date:18JAN2017) was conducted with a total of 366 OS events that are very 
close to the approximately 370 OS events defined in the protocol as the final analysis. The final study 
report is planned to be submitted in July 2018.

Analysis of OS before Month 4 
Due to the slope of KM curves, with an initial favourable treatment effect for the control arm followed by 
a convergence at approximately 2 months and a subsequent cross between Month 3 and Month 4, a 
review of OS events in the period from randomization to Month 4 was performed. 
In order to understand in more detail the risk of death within the first 4 months, the instantaneous 
hazard rate over time was evaluated (see Figure below). 
While the hazard rate for the pembrolizumab arm between 0 and approximately 2 months is above that 
of the control arm, thereafter the hazard rate in the pembrolizumab arm stays below the control arm. 
Subsequent analyses thus focused on the interval up to 2 months as well as up to 4 months.  
In the interval from randomization to 2 months, there were more deaths but far fewer subjects censored 
in the pembrolizumab arm than the control arm (43 vs. 24 deaths, respectively; 3 vs. 17 censored,

respectively). Reasons for censoring were Withdrawal by Subject (2) and Lost to Follow-up (1) for the 3 
patients on pembrolizumab arm, and Withdrawal by Subject for all 17 subjects on the control arm. 
In the interval from 2 months to Month 4, twice as many subjects died in the control arm as in the 
pembrolizumab arm (56 vs. 28, respectively) with 4 subjects and 2 subjects censored, respectively. 
Overall in the pembrolizumab arm there were 9 fewer deaths up to 4 months (71 deaths) compared to 
the control arm (80 deaths) and there were far fewer censored subjects (5 compared to 21). 
For subjects that died or were censored in the first 2.1 months, there are modest imbalances in baseline 
risk factors between the treatment groups, including a higher prevalence of the presence of liver 
metastases and reduced treatment free interval (< 3 months) in subjects treated with pembrolizumab 
compared with control subjects. 
To further assess potential factors that may influence the outcome in patients that might be treated with 
pembrolizumab compared to those on chemotherapy, a comparison of baseline characteristics between 
pembrolizumab and control arms of subjects who experienced early OS events (within 2.1 months) and of 
subjects who were censored for OS were each evaluated. It should be noted that the total number of 
subjects censored in the pembrolizumab arm within the first 2.1 months is small, 3 subjects, compared 
with 17 subjects in control arm, in part limiting the analysis. 
The percentages of subjects at baseline with each individual Bellmunt risk factor of poor prognosis (ECOG 
PS > 0, presence of liver metastasis, hemoglobin < 10g/dL, time from prior chemotherapy < 3 months), 
Bellmunt risk scores ≥  2, and additional characteristics of aggressive disease (baseline tumor burden ≥  
median, and presence of visceral metastasis) among early deaths (within 2.1 months) and among early 
censoring events (within 2.1 months) are shown in the following Tables.

Table 5: KN045 Percentage of Subjects with Risk Factors and Additional Characteristics of 
Aggressive Disease Among Early Overall Survival Censorings (<2.1 months) –  All Subjects 
Randomized (ITT Population) 
Among the deaths occurring within the first 2.1 months, a greater proportion of subjects in the 
pembrolizumab arm had liver metastasis and time from prior chemo <3 months. A higher proportion of 
subjects in the control arm had ECOG PS >0 and a similar proportion of subjects in both arms had 
haemoglobin <10 g/dL, Bellmunt Risk Score >2, baseline tumor burden > median and visceral 
metastasis. Among the early censored OS events, a greater proportion of subjects in the control arm had 
ECOG PS >0, Hb<10g/dL, Bellmunt risk scores >2, visceral metastasis and baseline tumor burden > 
median. A higher proportion of subjects in the pembrolizumab arm had time from prior chemotherapy < 3 
months and a similar proportion of subjects in both arms had liver metastasis.

o  ECOG  Performance  Status  of  2  (the  proportion  of  these  subjects  will  be  limited  to 
approximately 50% of the total population 
o  Creatinine clearance (calculated or measured) <60 mL/min but ≥30 mL/min 
Note:  Subjects  with  a  creatinine  clearance  (calculated  or  measured)  <30  mL/min  or  on 
dialysis are excluded from the trial 
o  CTCAE v.4, Grade ≥2 audiometric hearing loss (25dB in two consecutive wave ranges) 
o  CTCAE v.4, Grade ≥2 peripheral neuropathy 
o  New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III heart failure 
Note:  In  the  event  that  subjects  are  enrolled  for  the  purposes  of  determining  the  biomarker  cut-point 
prior to the start of the main body of this study, these subjects are not required to be cisplatin-ineligible 
and the above criteria does not apply. 
•  No  prior  systemic  chemotherapy  for  advanced/unresectable  (inoperable)  or  metastatic  urothelial 
cancer. 
o  Adjuvant platinum based chemotherapy, following radial cystectomy, with recurrence >12 
months from completion of therapy is permitted 
o  Neoadjuvant  platinum  based  chemotherapy,  with  recurrence  >12  months  since 
completion of therapy is permitted 
Note: Low-dose chemotherapy (eg, low dose cisplatin, cisplatin+5FU, mytomycin+5FU, 
or cisplatin+paclitaxel) given concurrent with radiation to the primary tumor site is not 
considered as systemic therapy.  
• 
Provided tissue for biomarker analysis from a newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a tumor 
lesion not previously irradiated (mandatory). Adequacy of the biopsy specimen for PD-L1 biomarker 
analysis must be confirmed by the central laboratory. 
•  Measureable disease based on RECIST 1.1 as assessed by central review. Tumor lesions situated in 
a previously irradiated area were considered measureable if progression had been demonstrated in 
such lesions.

administered agent. 
Notes:  Subjects  with  neuropathy  or  ≤  Grade  2  alopecia  were  an  exception  to  this  criterion  and  may 
qualify for the study.  If a subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the 
toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy. 
•  Known  additional  malignancy  progressing  or  requiring  active  treatment.  Exceptions  included  basal 
cell  carcinoma  of  the  skin,  squamous  cell  carcinoma  of  the  skin  that  had  undergone  potentially 
curative  therapy,  or  in  situ  cervical  cancer.  A  history  of  prostate  cancer  identified  incidentally 
following cysto-prostatectomy for bladder cancer was acceptable, provided that Stage was T2N0M0 
or lower, Gleason score ≤6, and prostate-specific antigen undetectable. 
•  Known  active  central  nervous  system  metastases  and/or  carcinomatous  meningitis.  Subjects  with 
previously-treated brain metastases may participate provided they were stable (without evidence of 
progression by imaging, confirmed by CT scan or MRI if used as prior imaging, for at least 4 weeks 
prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline), 
have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and were not using steroids for at least 7 
days  prior  to  trial  treatment.  This  exception  did  not  include  carcinomatous  meningitis,  which  was 
excluded regardless of clinical stability. 
•  Active  autoimmune  disease  requiring  systemic  treatment  in  the  past  2  years  (i.e.  with  use  of 
disease  modifying  agents,  corticosteroids  or  immunosuppressive  drugs).  Replacement  therapy 
(e.g.,  thyroxine,  insulin,  or  physiologic  corticosteroid  replacement  therapy  for  adrenal  or  pituitary 
insufficiency, etc.) is not considere d a form of systemic treatment. 
•  History  or  current  evidence  of  any  condition,  therapy,  or  laboratory  abnormality  that  could 
confound  the  results  of  the  trial,  interfere  with  the  subject’s  participation  for  the  full  duration  of 
the  trial,  or  not  in  the  best  interest  of  the  subject  to  participate,  in  the  opinion  of  the  treating 
Investigator. 
• 
Prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1 agent, or with anagent directed to another co-inhibitory 
T-cell receptor (eg, CTLA-4,OX-40, CD137). 
•  Known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV-1/2 antibodies).  
•  Administration of live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first administration of study medication.  
Treatments 
Pembrolizumab was administered at the fixed dosing regimen of 200 mg as a 30 minute (-5 min/+10 
min) IV infusion Q3W. 
Treatment could be continued until confirmed radiographic disease progression by RECIST 1.1, 
unacceptable adverse experiences, intercurrent illness that prevented further administration of treatment, 
Investigator’s decision to withdraw the subject, confirmed positive pregnancy test, non-compliance with 
trial treatment or procedure requirements, completed 24 months of pembrolizumab treatment or 
administrative reasons.  
Despite RECIST 1.1 defined progression, pembrolizumab could have been continued while awaiting 
radiologic confirmation of PD. If repeat imaging still meets the threshold for PD (≥ 20% increase in tumor

burden compared to nadir) but shows a reduction in tumor burden compared to the previous time point, 
treatment may be continued as per treatment calendar after consultation with Sponsor. 
Patients who stopped pembrolizumab after receiving 24 months of treatment for reasons other than 
disease progression or intolerability, or after a complete response having received at least 24 weeks of 
pembrolizumab and at least 2 treatments beyond the date of initial CR declared, may have been eligible 
for up to one additional year of retreatment upon experiencing disease progression. 
Objectives 
The study primary objective was to evaluate the anti-tumor activity of pembrolizumab in terms of 
Objective Response Rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1 by independent radiology review in all subjects with 
advanced/unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who are ineligible to receive cisplatin-based 
therapy, as well as in those with PD-L1 positive (CPS≥1%) and PD-L1 strongly positive (CPS cut point 
determined from biomarker discovery population) tumors.  
As secondary objectives, the pembrolizumab activity was evaluated in terms of duration of response 
(DOR) per RECIST 1.1 by independent radiology review, PFS  per RECIST 1.1 by independent radiology 
review (including PFS rate at 6 and 12 months), and OS (including OS rate at 6 and 12 months). 
In addition, the anti-tumor activity in terms of ORR, DOR and PFS based on modified RECIST 1.1 by 
independent radiology review, the relationship between candidate efficacy/resistance biomarkers and 
pembrolizumab anti-tumor activity based on pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsies and blood sampling, 
the PK profile of pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W, the changes in health-related quality-of-life assessments 
from baseline using the EORTC QLQ-C30, and the characterization of utilities using the EQ-5D  were 
evaluated as exploratory objectives in PD-L1 strongly positive, PD-L1 positive, and all subjects.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) based on RECIST 1.1 criteria assessed 
by independent radiology review of imaging studies performed at both planned and unplanned time 
points during the study. ORR was estimated for all subjects, for subjects with PD-L1 expression (CPS) 
≥1%, and for subjects with strongly positive CPS expression (CPS) ≥10%, that was determined as a 
secondary study objective of the trial, based on assessment of activity in the biomarker discovery cohort 
(the first 100 subjects enrolled). All other efficacy analyses involving subsets of the population defined in 
terms of the strongly positive CPS cutpoint were conducted among the PD-L1 ≥10% from the validation 
cohort, with the exclusion of patients in the discovery cohort.  
Additional secondary efficacy endpoints were DOR (RECIST 1.1 by independent radiology review); PFS 
(RECIST 1.1 by independent radiology review); overall survival (OS); PFS (RECIST 1.1 by independent 
radiology review) rate and OS rate at 6 months and 12 months. 
Additional exploratory endpoints were to investigate the relationship between biomarkers and anti-tumor 
activity, to evaluate the pembrolizumab anti-tumor activity by ORR, DOR and PFS based on modified 
RECIST 1.1 by independent radiology review, and to evaluate changes in health-related quality-of-life 
assessments from baseline using the EORTC QLQ-C30.  
The definition of primary and secondary endpoints is reported in the below Table “Summary of Efficacy 
for trial KEYNOTE-052”. 
Assessment report  
EMA/512404/2017

Response to treatment was assessed with radiographic imaging at 9 weeks (63 ± 7 days) after the first 
dose of pembrolizumab and every 6 weeks thereafter (42 days ± 7 days). Subjects who remained on 
treatment beyond 1 year had imaging assessments performed every 12 weeks (84 ± 7 days). All on-trial 
imaging was submitted to the central vendor for BICR review per RECIST 1.1 for determination of ORR 
and PFS. The Investigator may have chosen to treat beyond RECIST 1.1 defined progression if subjects 
continued deriving clinical benefit and were clinically stable. 
 The APT population, including all enrolled subjects who received at least 1 dose of pembrolizumab, 
served as the primary population for the efficacy analyses. Supportive analyses were to be conducted in 
the Full Analysis Set (FAS) population, consisting of all enrolled subjects who received at least 1 dose of 
pembrolizumab and had measureable disease at baseline. In this case, the APT and FAS  populations 
overlapped,  and therefore supportive analyses were not performed. 
Additional not protocol-specified analyses were conducted to further characterize pembrolizumab efficacy 
and safety profile in the target population. In order to determine the influence on the primary endpoint 
estimation of the duration of follow up and of radiology reader variability ORR was determined among 
subjects with longer follow-up than the total APT population and by investigator per RECIST v1.1. 
Although the primary analysis for CPS ≥10% was conducted on the validation cohort, a supportive 
analysis combining the biomarker discovery and validation cohorts was performed in order to assess the 
ORR in strongly positive across the entire study population. 
Sample size 
The sample size calculation was driven by the primary efficacy estimation for PD -L1 CPS ≥10% subjects. 
Up to 350 subjects were to be enrolled. Assuming a 33% prevalence rate of PD-L1 CPS ≥10% subjects 
and 100 subjects in the biomarker discovery population, there was an 88% chance to have at least 75 
PD-L1 CPS ≥10% subjects and 99.9% chance to have at least 60 PD-L1 CPS ≥10% subjects in the 
validation cohort (N ≈ 250). 
Randomisation 
Treatment allocation was performed centrally using an interactive voice response system/integrated web 
response system (IVRS/IWRS) by non-random assignment.   
Blinding (masking) 
Not applicable. This is an open label trial. 
Statistical methods 
A preliminary assessment of clinical activity within the discovery cohort to determine the strongly positive 
cut-off as a function of ORR was performed in the first 100 subjects.  The APT population, consisting of all 
enrolled subjects who received at least one dose of study treatment, served as the primary population for 
the analyses of efficacy data in this trial. The biomarker discovery population, subjects in this trial used 
for the determination of the PD-L1 strongly positive cut-point, was to be excluded from efficacy analyses 
for the PD-L1 strongly positive population. These subjects were still to be included in the efficacy analyses 
for all and PD-L1 positive subjects. Efficacy analyses were conducted according to the methods reported 
in the table below. 
Assessment report  
EMA/512404/2017 
Page 78/146 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
An interim efficacy evaluation was performed in which enrollment of PD-L1 negative (CPS <1%) subjects 
could have been stopped if the ORR was low and substantial enrollment remained. This futility analysis 
was based on the evaluable PD-L1 negative subjects in the biomarker discovery population (up to the first 
25 subjects). If the number of PD-L1 negative subjects in the biomarker subgroup was less than 20, 
additional PD-L1 negative subjects could be included until the number reached at least 20. The non-
binding rule for futility required that the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) (2-sided) for the 
ORR be less than 20% (needed at least 1 response in N < 26 subjects and at least 2 responses in N = 26 
to 40 subjects).

Participant flow 
Recruitment 
Overall, 370 patients were enrolled and treated in 77 activated centers from 20 April 2015 to 21 June 
2016. The highest enrolling country was the US with a total of 159 subjects. 
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol (dated 29 August 2014) was amended twice during the study conduction.  
The key changes introduced by the protocol amendments are summarized below: 
Protocol Amendment  Most relevant changes

Safety and tolerability were to be evaluated in all subjects regardless of PD-L1 
status. 
The screening window for the new core or excisional biopsy for biomarker 
analysis was increased to 56 days (8 weeks). 
Addition to indicate that PD-L1 positive was prospectively defined as subjects 
with Combined Positive Score (CPS) ≥1%. 
Removal of hypotheses testing since the objective of the trial was to estimate 
efficacy, and the success of the trial was determined by clinically meaningful 
ORRs and durability of the response. 
The number of subjects to be used for the biomarker cut-point analysis was 
updated from ~150 subjects to ~100 subjects. 
Clarification that bone scans must have been submitted for review at baseline 
to the central imaging vendor even though bone scans were not part of 
#2 (11 March 2016) 
determining RECIST measurability. 
The 56 day screening window requirement for the new core or excisional 
biopsy was removed from the protocol to offer more 
operational flexibility, as long as the subject has not received any 
intervening systemic therapy from the time the tissue was collected until the 
time the subject enters the study. 
The All-Patients-Treated (APT) population was identified as the primary 
efficacy and safety analysis population, based on FDA requirement for single 
arm trials. 
There were 9 major protocol deviations deemed clinically relevant from 6 different sites, 3 in Spain, 1 in 
the US, and 2 in Italy. Two clinically relevant major protocol deviations were categorized as entry criteria 
deviations and pertained to allocation/treatment despite creatinine and bilirubin being above allowable 
limits. A third subject was allocated/treated despite having a history of Gleason 8 prostate cancer. Two 
major protocol deviations occurred when 2 subjects each were treated with corticosteroids for non-ECI 
AEs during the trial which was prohibited except to treat pre-defined immune-related AEs. For 4 subjects, 
clinically relevant major protocol deviations occurred in relation to bone scan efficacy assessments, as 
they did not have follow-up scans despite the presence of osseous metastatic disease at study entry. No 
subjects were excluded from the analysis due to a protocol deviation. 
For 2 additional subjects, the blinded central independent radiology vendor notified sites that the subjects 
had RECIST-measurable disease. However, when the imaging data for these subjects was formally 
analyzed for outcome, no target lesions were identified. Being treated, subjects were included in the 
analysis in the denominator of the ORR calculations as per the protocol statistical analysis plan, but they 
were not counted as complete or partial responders.

Numbers analysed 
The same patient population, consisting of the 370 subjects who were enrolled and treated in the trial, 
served as the primary population for the efficacy analyses (APT: All-Patients-Treated population) and  
was used for the analysis of safety data (APaT: All Patients as Treated population).  
A biomarker discovery population cohort including the first 100 subjects enrolled and treated served for 
determination of the PD-L1 strongly positive cut-point.  
Analyses of the pre-specified patient reported outcomes (PRO) from the EORTC QLC-C30 and EQ-5D 
questionnaires were conducted in the PRO-specific full analysis set (FAS) population, including 367 
patients who received at least 1 dose of study medication and completed at least 1 PRO instrument. 
Outcomes and estimation 
The activity reported in the biomarker discovery cohort, including the first 100 subjects enrolled and 
treated, served for determination of the PD-L1 strongly positive cut-point.  
The biomarker discovery cohort was excluded from the primary efficacy analyses for subjects in the

In the initial submission (cut-off data:01-Sep-2016), the median duration of follow-up for all subjects in 
the APT population was 5 months (range 0.1-16.5 months). An updated analysis (Cut-off data: 
09Mar2017) was conducted at a median follow-up of 9.5 months (0.1-22.7). For the tables below, first

Patient Reported Outcomes  
EORTC QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D Compliance Rate and Completion Rate 
Compliance rates for both the EORTC QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D were 90% or above at baseline, and over 86% 
at Week 9. Completion rates, calculated for each visit from baseline to Week 57, remained above 70% at 
each time point after baseline, until Week 9, when they dropped as patients discontinued the study due 
to disease progression, physician decision, AEs, or death. 
EORTC QLQ-C30 analysis 
At week 9, the majority of the subjects experienced improvement of 10 or more points (31%) or stable 
global health status/QoL (42%). This was observed for all EORTC functioning and symptom domains. An 
improved quality of life was registered for patients who remained on treatment, although scores after 
Week 9 should be interpreted with caution due to the small sample size.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
A systematic literature review and meta-analysis to compile ORR, DOR and OS to historical first line 
therapies for advanced/metastatic urothelial cancer was submitted.  
PUBMED (Medline), Cochrane, and EMBASE databases were searched to identify clinical trials published in 
English language since 1 January 1991. Randomized controlled trials, single arm trials, retrospective 
studies and observational studies were included in the initial step of the review. Any agent given in the

first line setting for subjects with advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who are cisplatin-ineligible (i.e. 
single agent or combination therapy, including, but not limited to, carboplatin, gemcitabine, paclitaxel, 
methotrexate, vinflunine, vinblastine, epirubicin, docetaxel, oxaliplatin and doxorubicin) were defined as 
comparator therapies.  
Systematic Review  
The combined literature searches (PUBMED, Cochrane, Embase), identified a total of 3297 references. A 
comprehensive search strategy was used to identify references that addressed the 1L therapy of cisplatin-
ineligible subjects with advanced/metastatic urothelial cancer, thus resulting in 97 references. However, 
the majority of these 97 references included subjects with good performance status and adequate renal 
function. In order to generate the most appropriate reference data for KN052, only references with 
similar inclusion criteria in terms of performance status and renal function were included in the meta-
analysis. At the end of the filtering process, 18 publications, representing 21 treatment arms (12 
carboplatin based; 13 gemcitabine based; 8 carboplatin/gemcitabine), that unambiguously reported 
responses in cisplatin-ineligible subjects being treated in the first line setting for advanced/metastatic 
urothelial cancer, were included. Only one Phase III study was reported for the scenario of interest, while 
the other identified studies were mostly Phase II studies or retrospective studies. For many combinations, 
multiple studies were unavailable, and hence meta-analysis was not feasible.  
The pooled analysis yielded an ORR of 36% (95% CI: 30%, 42%). Median duration of response (DOR) 
was 6.52 months (95% CI: 5.47-7.76), and median overall survival (OS) was 9.84 months (95% CI: 
8.37-11.57). Heterogeneity among studies was performed through the I2 statistic and resulted to be 
substantial for ORR and OS data (60.4% and 81.5% respectively). 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The  Keytruda  extension  of  indication  in  the  treatment  of  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  urothelial 
carcinoma is sought concomitantly in two specific settings, each one based on one single pivotal trial: 
1.  Study KEYNOTE-045, in advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma progressing after platinum-
based chemotherapy  
2.  Study  KEYNOTE-052,  in  patients  previously  untreated  and  not  eligible  to  cisplatin-containing 
chemotherapy. 
In both studies, patients were enrolled independently from PD-L1 expression, with the provision of tissue 
for  biomarker  analysis  as  a  requirement  for  eligibility,  and  the  PD-L1  status  was  defined  based  on  a 
Combined  Positive  Score  (CPS),  including  the  PD-L1  expression  on  both  tumor  and  infiltrating  immune 
cells. This scoring system was selected based on the results from an earlier study KEYNOTE-012, in which 
two different scoring systems, one based on tumour cell staining alone and the other based on staining in 
both  tumour  cells  and  inflammatory  cells,  were  evaluated  to  analyse  the  relationship  between  PD-L1 
expression  and  clinical  response.  Results  from  this  post-hoc  analysis  showed  the  importance  to 
incorporate  inflammatory  cells  into  the  determination  of  PD-L1  status  for  the  selection  of  patients  more 
likely  to  respond  to  pembrolizumab.  In  both  urothelial  carcinoma  studies,  two  PD-L1  CPS  cut-off  were 
evaluated: PD-L1 CPS ≥ 1% determined exclusively using KN012 data, and the CPS ≥ 10% defined based 
on the first 100 subjects in KN052 which served as the training data set.

Study KEYNOTE-045 in advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma patients progressing after 
platinum-based chemotherapy   
Design and conduct of clinical study 
This is a phase III randomized trial of pembrolizumab versus Investigator’s choice (paclitaxel, docetaxel 
or vinflunine) in subjects with recurrent or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who experienced progression 
after a platinum-based regimen.  
Overall, 542 patients were randomized in the trial and allocated with a 1:1 ratio in the pembrolizumab 
arm (270 patients) and in the chemotherapy group (272 patients). Inclusion criteria allowed the 
enrolment in the trial of a quite heterogeneous population in terms of prior treatments and ECOG PS. 
Indeed, differently from studies with other checkpoint inhibitors in patients progressing after platinum-
based chemotherapy, ECOG PS2 patients were considered eligible, but only in selected conditions (i.e, 
haemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dL, no liver metastases, treatment interval before enrollment ≥ 3 months). In the 
absence of a well globally established standard of care, the proposed comparators are deemed 
acceptable. Indeed, taxanes are commonly used off-label in clinical practice, and vinflunine is approved 
only in EU for the treatment of advanced or metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelial tract 
after failure of a prior platinum-containing regimen. On this basis, an imbalance in the number of patients 
allocated to each regimen in the control arm could have been expected. However, the number of patients 
allocated to each chemotherapy regimen was quite well balanced (i.e. 84 patients with paclitaxel; 84 
patients with docetaxel; 85 patients with vinflunine).  
PFS per RECIST 1.1 based on BICR and OS were selected as dual primary endpoints, meaning that the 
study could be considered to have met its primary objective if superiority was demonstrated for PFS or 
OS in the overall population or in any of the subgroups analysed based on PD-L1 expression. As 
secondary endpoints, confirmed ORR per RECIST 1.1 and mRECIST by BICR, duration response per 
RECIST 1.1 by BICR and PFS per mRECIST were also evaluated. The statistical assumptions for the 
definition of sample size can be considered reasonable, providing enough power for the comparison also 
in PD-L1 CPS ≥ 10% subjects. There are two planned PFS analyses (IA1 and final), and three planned OS 
analyses (IA1, IA2 and final). The statistical plan includes a set of comprehensive subgroup analyses, 
taking into account the most relevant prognostic factors, which is considered appropriate. Overall, the 
statistical methods are acceptable. The control for multiplicity is considered appropriate. 
The choice to include patients regardless of PD-L1 status is acceptable based on the lack of sufficient data 
to justify enrichment at the time the study started. For the same reason PD-L1 status was not even 
considered as a stratification factor. However, based on emerging evidence on the correlation between 
PD-L1 status and outcomes, the statistical analysis plan was updated while the study was ongoing to 
incorporate new primary hypotheses for PD-L1 positive (CPS≥1%) and strongly positive (CPS≥10%) 
subjects (Amendment#9). Further changes to the biomarker strategy were then introduced based on 
external results coming KN052, and the formal test for hypotheses on PD-L1 CPS≥ 1% was deleted 
through Amendment# 13, released after IA1 and data cut-off date. A reallocation of alpha with proper 
adjustment to maintain the control of family-wise type I error rate (FWER) was made. Even if the adopted 
strategy of alpha re-allocation seems to be in principle reasonable, the lack of a rigorous approach in the 
specification of the statistical methods in the protocol, before any interim analysis was conducted, is 
noted.  
Stratification has been performed according to well recognised prognostic factors in second line setting 
(ECOG PS 0/1 vs 2; presence or absence of liver metastases; Haemoglobin ≥10 g/dL vs <10 g/dL; time 
from completion of most recent chemotherapy <3 months vs ≥3 months). 
Assessment report  
EMA/512404/2017 
Page 98/146 
 
  
  
Baseline characteristics were overall well balanced in the two treatment arms. The median age of patients 
was slightly higher in the pembrolizumab arm (67 vs 65 years), with 61.1% of patients ≥65 years 
compared to 54% in the control arm. Fifty-five percent of patients were PD-L1 <1% (56% in the 
pembrolizumab arm and 54% in the control group), while respectively 33% in the control arm and 27.4% 
in the pembrolizumab group were PD-L1≥10%. 
In general eligibility criteria are considered adequate to define a 2L+ UC patient population (including 
subjects with failure of neoadjuvant/adjuvant treatment within 12 months). However subjects with poor 
prognostic /baseline characteristics are not fully represented (e.g. ECOG PS 2 subjects could not have 
additional unfavourable prognostic factors, subjects with more than 2 prior lines of systemic 
chemotherapy for metastatic disease, active brain metastases or inadequate organ function were 
excluded). Lastly, only 6 patients with ECOG PS of 2 (1.1% of study population) were included, which is 
seen as critical considering the general high proportion of patients with reduced performance status in 
patients with advanced / metastatic UC. Only 7 patients (1.3%) were included with brain metastases and 
only 21% had two prior treatments. Most patients (76%) had been eligible to receive Cisplatin as prior 
platinum therapy. In this context it is notable that 27% of screened subjects were non-randomized, 
because they did not meet eligibility criteria. Most of these (nearly 80%) were not included in the study 
due to unfavourable prognostic factors or comorbidities.  
15 subjects in the control arm withdrew consent after randomisation before start of treatment (none in 
the pembrolizumab treatment arm). Moreover a higher proportion of subjects discontinued studied 
medication due to withdrawal by subjects or physician decision in the control arm (n=56) compared to 
the pembrolizumab arm (n=9). It may be assumed that this at least partly reflects that assignment to the 
chemotherapy arm did not meet expectations of patients and physicians in this open-label trial. This high 
rate of (premature) withdrawals raises concerns with regards to a possible underperformance of the 
control arm in an ITT analysis. However a consistent benefit in OS favouring pembrolizumab versus 
chemotherapy has been reported by sensitivity analyses, even when patients not treated or discontinued 
due to withdrawal by subject or physician decision were excluded. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The MAH submitted OS results from IA2, with 334 OS events in all comer patients and 104 in PD-L1 
CPS≥10% patients. Even if, with 36 additional OS events, results are not expected to significantly 
change, the final analysis data should be provided and this is requested as a post-authorisation efficacy 
study. 
Overall, a statistically significant gain of 3 months in OS is reported in the overall population (HR:0.73, 
95% CI 0.59, 0.91, p=0.002). The median OS in the chemotherapy arm (7.4 months, 95% CI 6.1, 8.3) is 
consistent with historical data from single-agent second line treatment.  
Consistently, a significant OS increase was observed in PD-L1 strongly positive patients (CPS≥10%) 
treated with pembrolizumab compared to chemotherapy (HR:0.57, 95% CI 0.37, 0.88, p=0.004). In 
addition, even though p-value was not multiplicity-adjusted, results in PD-L1 positive patients (CPS≥1%) 
showed a similar magnitude of OS benefit (HR:0.61, 95% CI 0.43, 0.86, p=0.002) compared to PD-L1 
strongly positive.  
The visual inspection of the KM curves of OS shows an initial favourable effect in the control arm followed 
by a cross between month 3 and month 4 from the start of treatment. A review of early events in order 
to clarify potential factors influencing such outcome was provided: apart from the number of censoring in 
the first 2 months that was much higher in the control arm compared to the pembrolizumab arm (17 vs 
3), an excess of deaths in the pembrolizumab arm was observed in the first two months (43 in 
pembrolizumab vs 24 in control arm). Liver metastases and time from most recent prior therapy of < 3

months were identified as possible factors associated to the higher risk of early death. No benefit (instead 
a detrimental effect) was observed for pembrolizumab in terms of median PFS per RECIST 1.1 based on 
BICR in the ITT population. This is not an unexpected finding, considering the different mechanism of 
action of chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors, and taking into account the possibility of a 
delayed response not captured by RECIST 1.1. As observed for OS curves, the slope of the KM curves 
shows an initial unfavourable treatment effect for pembrolizumab followed by a cross at Month 5 and a 
trend to diverge after 6 months, with a PFS rate at 12 months of 6.2% in the control arm and 16.8% with 
pembrolizumab.  
A similar trend of PFS KM-curves was observed in patients with PD-L1 positive tumour (CPS ≥10% and 
≥1%), with consistent median PFS value across subpopulations and a sustained effect in a subset of 
patients. PFS based on modified RECIST in these subgroups also showed similar results. 
Since patients could stay on treatment beyond progression to account for the possibility of pseudo-
progression and delayed response, PFS based on modified RECIST was also analysed, showing however 
similar findings.  
A higher ORR has been consistently reported in the pembrolizumab arm compared to chemotherapy in 
the total population (21.1% vs 11.4%), in PD-L1 CPS≥10% (21.6% vs 6.7%) and in PD-L1 CPS≥1% 
(23.6% vs 8.3%). On the other hand, chemotherapy produced disease stabilisation in a larger number of 
patients (33.5% vs 17.4% in the total population; 35.6% vs 12.2% in PD-L1 CPS≥10%; 35% vs 15.5% 
in PD-L1 CPS≥1%). Waterfall Plots of Best Tumour Change from Baseline were provided showing a higher 
frequency of deep responses with pembrolizumab compared to chemotherapy. ORR differences for 
pembrolizumab vs. control in subjects with PD-L1 CPS <1% and PD-L1 <10% were lower compared to 
those of the higher PD-L1 subgroups, but ORR results for pembrolizumab still remained favourable 
compared to the chemotherapy control group.  
No differences in the median time to tumour response were observed among arms in all populations, but 
responses were considerably longer with pembrolizumab (median time not reached with the current data 
cut-off for pembrolizumab and 4.3 months in the control arm).  
Efficacy results for all endpoints were confirmed by the performed sensitivity analyses.   
More than half of included patients were PD-L1 negative (CPS <1%) in both arms (54% in the control 
arm and 56% in the pembrolizumab arm). Efficacy results, in subgroups with PD-L1 CPS <1% and PD-L1 
<10%, show that OS, PFS, ORR and best change from tumor baseline were overall consistent with the 
results in the overall population. 
Indeed, contrasting evidences on the role of PD-L1 expression as biomarker for response are provided by 
other immune checkpoint inhibitors. In the phase II, single arm study CheckMate 275, responses to 
nivolumab were seen irrespective of PD-L1 expression (Sharma P, Lancet 2017). On the other hand, a 
higher immune-cell PD-L1 expression was associated with higher atezolizumab response in the phase II, 
single arm IMvigor 210 study (Rosemberg JE, Lancet 2016). However the randomized phase III study 
(IMvigor 211) of atezolizumab vs. chemotherapy control demonstrated a negative prognostic value of PD-
L1 expression in immune cells (i.e. higher PD-L1 expression was associated with worse outcome in both, 
the atezolizumab treatment group and the control arm), but PD-L1 expression was not predictive. 
An updated efficacy analysis for KN045 was performed with a cut-off date of 18JAN2017 and a total of 
366 OS events. A robust OS improvement favoring pembrolizumab as compared with chemotherapy 
control continues to be noted in the overall population [OS HR: 0.70 (0.57, 0.86), p-value:0.0004]. No 
improvement in PFS for pembrolizumab compared with chemotherapy control is observed [PFS HR: 0.96 
(0.79, 1.16), p-value:0.322] albeit a plateau in the tail of the Kaplan-Meier curves suggest durable 
clinical benefit for a subset of patients. The improvement in response rates compared with the

chemotherapy control was confirmed at the longer follow-up in the overall population (21.1% vs 11%), 
as well as in PD-L1 CPS≥10% (20.3% vs 6.7%) and in PD-L1 CPS≥1% (22.7% vs 8.3%). 
Results of analyses on exploratory biomarkers (proteomic signatures, genetic variation, and gene 
expression signatures) will be part of the final KN045 CSR that is planned to be submitted as a Post-
Authorisation Efficacy Study (PAES) in July 2018. 
Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were assessed using EORTC QLQ-C30. A prolonged time to 
deterioration in EORTC QLQ-C30 global health status/QoL was observed for patients treated with 
pembrolizumab compared to investigator’s choice chemotherapy (HR 0.70; 95% CI 0.55-0.90). Over 15 
weeks of follow-up, patients treated with pembrolizumab had stable global health status/QoL, while those 
treated with investigator’s choice chemotherapy had a decline in global health status/QoL, however these 
results should be interpreted in the context of the open-label study design and therefore taken cautiously. 
Study  KEYNOTE-052:  patients  previously  untreated  and  not  eligible  to  cisplatin-containing 
chemotherapy 
Design and conduct of clinical study 
This is a Phase II single arm trial of pembrolizumab in first-line cisplatin-ineligible advanced/unresectable 
or metastatic urothelial carcinoma. Overall, the eligibility criteria are acceptable. In particular, the criteria 
for cisplatin-ineligibility are deemed acceptable and reflect the standard criteria used in clinical practice. 
Patients were enrolled irrespective of PD-L1 status. In comparison to study KN-045, only freshly-obtained 
biopsy specimen was required for PD-L1 biomarker analysis. A total of 370 patients were enrolled. A 
biomarker discovery cohort, including the first 100 subjects enrolled and treated, served for 
determination of the PD-L1 strongly positive cut-point. This population was excluded from efficacy 
analyses for the PD-L1 strongly positive population, which were conducted on the biomarker validation 
cohort (n = 270 overall). The primary efficacy endpoint was ORR based on RECIST 1.1 criteria assessed 
by independent radiology review that was estimated for all subjects, for subjects with PD-L1 expression 
(CPS) ≥ 1%, and for subjects with strongly positive CPS expression (CPS) ≥ 10%. DOR (RECIST 1.1 by 
independent radiology review); PFS (RECIST 1.1 by independent radiology review); OS; PFS (RECIST 1.1 
by independent radiology review) rate and OS rate at 6 months and 12 months were among secondary 
endpoints. 
The sample size was initially driven by the primary efficacy hypothesis of a true ORR > 30% and 2.5% 
(one-sided) type 1 error in PD -L1 positive subjects. Based on amendment#2 the efficacy hypothesis on 
ORR was removed with the justification that the success of the study was to be determined by clinically 
meaningful ORRs and durability of the response. 
As expected based on eligibility criteria, the enrolled population was mostly ≥ 65 years (81.6%), with a 
median age of 74 years. The most common reasons for cisplatin ineligibility were renal dysfunction 
(50%), ECOG PS 2 (32.4) or both renal dysfunction and ECOG PS 2 (9%). In addition, the majority of 
patients (85.1%) had visceral metastases. As concern PD-L1 expression, 21.4% were PD-L1<1%, while 
most of patients (46.5%) of had a PD-L1 CPS in the range of 1% to 10%. A discrepancy is noted between 
the prevalence of PD-L1< 1% patients in Study KN052 and Study KN045 that could not be explained by 
the MAH, but will be further evaluated in future clinical trials in UC. 
Pembrolizumab was administered at the fixed dosing regimen of 200 mg Q3W, which is acceptable.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
An ORR of 24.1% (95% CI 19.8, 28.7) was reported in the overall population. In 282 PD-L1 positive 
patients ORR was 26.6% (95% CI 21.5, 32.2). When considering the subgroup of PD-L1 strongly positive 
patients from the validation cohort, a higher ORR was reported 38.8% (95% CI 28.1, 50.3). 
In the first-line therapy of urothelial carcinoma, an ORR up to 30%-40% with a median OS of 9 months 
has been reported with carboplatin-containing (De Santis M, J Clin Oncol 2012). 
Updated results with a median follow-up of 9.5 months showed an improvement in ORR in the overall 
population [29.2% (95% CI 24.6, 34.1)]. Median DOR has not been reached yet, thus responses with 
pembrolizumab last longer compared to those achieved by chemotherapy in the submitted meta-analysis 
(median DOR 6.52, upper 95% CI 7.76 months). Although the ORR was higher in PD-L1 CPS ≥ 10% 
patients [47.3% (95% CI: 37.7, 57.0)], responses were also registered in PD-L1 CPS < 10% and CPS 
<1% patients [21.1% (95% CI: 16.2, 26.7) and 16.5% (95% CI: 9.1, 26.5), respectively]. The disease 
control rate, which includes subjects with CR, PR, and stable disease was 47.3% (95% CI: 42.1, 52.5), 
suggesting that there is a larger pool of subjects who may benefit from pembrolizumab beyond those who 
experience a confirmed response as measured by RECIST 1.1. 
With 67 additional PFS events at longer follow up, a slight improvement compared to the original analysis 
has been reported in terms of median PFS [2.3 months (95% CI: 2.1, 3.4) versus 2.1 months (95% CI: 
2.1,  3.3)],  PFS  rate  at  6  months  [33.8%  (95%  CI:  29.0%,  38.7%)  versus  30.6%  (95%  CI:  25.2%, 
36.2%)]  and  PFS  rate  at 12  months  [21.8%  (95% CI:  17.4%,  26.6%)  versus  19.0%  (95%  CI:  13.0%, 
25.8%)]. 
Compared  to  the  original  submission,  a  consistent  median  OS  (11  months)  was  reported,  with  a  slight 
increase in the OS rate at 12 months [46.8 (41.1, 52.3) versus 41.2 (31.4, 50.7)]. 
Median  PFS  data  remained  unfavourable  in  comparison  to  chemotherapy  despite  a  small  improvement 
with  longer  duration  of  follow-up;  however  benefits  of  pembrolizumab  might  not  been  captured  by 
median  PFS  values.  Durable  responses  appear  to  be  reflected  in  a  plateau  in  the  tail  of  the  KM  curve 
beginning at approximately 8 months.  
In order to provide information for contextualisation of the results in cisplatin ineligible patients, the MAH 
conducted and provided a systematic literature review and meta-analysis. The pooled analysis yielded an 
ORR of 36% (95% CI: 30%, 42%). Median duration of response (DOR) was 6.52 months (95% CI: 5.47-
7.76),  and  median  overall  survival  (OS)  was  9.84  months  (95%  CI:  8.37-11.57).  Heterogeneity  among 
studies was performed through the I2 statistic and resulted to be substantial for ORR and OS data (60.4% 
and 81.5% respectively). The quality of trials included in the meta-analysis was assessed by the MAH to 
evaluate  the  risk  of  bias  (including  selection  bias,  performance  bias,  detection  bias,  attrition  bias  or 
reporting bias) that resulted to be high in most of the trials. This can be explained considering that only 
one of them was a phase III study, while the others were phase II trials with a small sample size. Overall, 
the quality of the included trials is not fully reassuring on the validity of the results of the meta-analysis. 
In the context of scientific advice (EMEA/H/SA/2437/14/2016/II) it was recommended to capture in Study 
KN052  post-progression  treatments  and  responses  to  treatments  to  assess  the  impact  of  2nd-line 
chemotherapies.  Overall,  post-progression  systemic  therapy  was  reported  in  88  subjects  (24%),  and 
most  of  them  (56  patients)  received  carboplatin/gemcitabine  combination.  However,  post-progression 
treatment responses were not captured for KN052 subjects. 
Patient reported outcomes were assessed using EORTC QLQ-C30. At week 9, the majority of the subjects 
experienced improvement or stable global health status/QoL across all EORTC functioning and symptom 
domains, although scores after Week 9 should be interpreted with caution due to the small sample size. 
Both the EQ-5D VAS score and the EQ-5D Utility scores were stable over time.

Additional efficacy data will be provided with the following Post-Authorisation Efficacy Study (PAES):  
- Study KN361 comparing pembrolizumab with or without platinum-based combination chemotherapy and 
chemotherapy alone in both cisplatin-eligible and ineligible patients. 
- Study P045 comparing pembrolizumab versus Paclitaxel, Docetaxel or Vinflunine in Subjects with 
Recurrent or Progressive Metastatic Urothelial Cancer.   
- Study P052, evaluating pembrolizumab in patients with Advanced/Unresectable or Metastatic Urothelial 
Cancer.   
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Based on efficacy results from study KN045, a broad indication, including patients with locally advanced 
or  metastatic  urothelial  carcinoma  who  have  received  prior  chemotherapy,  regardless  of  PD-L1 
expression, has been requested by the MAH. Statistically significant and clinically meaningful gains in OS 
were reported across population (all-comers, PD-L1 CPS ≥1% and PD-L1 CPS ≥10%).  
Even if the efficacy of pembrolizumab in the 1L cisplatin-ineligible UC population is only based on a single 
non-randomized study, with still an insufficient duration of follow-up and observed response rates slightly 
lower  compared  to  historical  data  for  chemotherapy,  results  compare  rather  favourable  with 
chemotherapy in terms of duration of responses and OS.  
Additional  efficacy  data  from  the  ongoing  Studies  should  be  provided  in  order  to  obtain  further  efficacy 
data as Post-Authorisation Efficacy Studies (PAES): 
- Study P361 comparing pembrolizumab with or without platinum-based combination chemotherapy and 
chemotherapy alone in both cisplatin-eligible and ineligible patients. 
-  Study  P045  comparing  pembrolizumab  versus  Paclitaxel,  Docetaxel  or  Vinflunine  in  Subjects  with 
Recurrent or Progressive Metastatic Urothelial Cancer.   
-  Study  P052,  evaluating  pembrolizumab  (MK-3475)  in  Subjects  with  Advanced/Unresectable  or 
Metastatic Urothelial Cancer. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The known pembrolizumab safety profile, evaluated across clinical studies in advanced melanoma (1567 
patients from studies KEYNOTE-001, KEYNOTE-002 and KEYNOTE-006), advanced NSCLC (1386 patients 
from  studies  KEYNOTE-001,  KEYNOTE-010  and  KEYNOTE-024),  and  classical  Hodgkin  Lymphoma  (241 
patients  from  studies  KEYNOTE-087  and  KEYNOTE-013)  is  mainly  associated  with  immune-related 
adverse  reactions  and  characterized  by  general  (fatigue),  gastrointestinal  (diarrhoea  and  nausea)  and 
skin  (rash  and  pruritus)  disorders.  The  majority  of  adverse  reactions  reported  were  of  Grade  1  or  2 
severity  and  the  most  serious  were  immune-related  adverse  reactions  and  severe  infusion-related 
reactions.  
Within this application safety results have been presented by: 
•  Study  KEYNOTE-045,  including  266  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  urothelial  carcinoma  patients 
previously  treated  with  platinum-containing  chemotherapy,  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of 
Assessment report

pembrolizumab  (data  Cut-off  date:  07  September  2016;  updated  data  Cut-off  date:  18  Jan 
2017). 
•  Study  KEYNOTE-052,  including  370  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  urothelial  carcinoma  patients 
previously untreated and cisplatin-ineligible, who received at least 1 dose of pembrolizumab (data 
Cut-off date: 01 September 2016; updated data Cut-off date: 09 Mar 2017). 
•  Reference Safety Dataset, a pooled population of 3,194 subjects, including  patients with NSCLC 
(studies  KN-001,  KN-010  and  KN-024),  melanoma  (studies  KN-001,  KEYNOTE-002,  KEYNOTE-
006), Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (studies KN-013 and KN-087) and urothelial carcinoma ( studies KN-
045 and KN-052), which is used to compare with studies KEYNOTE-045 and -052. 
•  Cumulative  Running  Safety  Dataset,  including  cumulative  pembrolizumab  safety  data  from  all 
studies  reported  to  the  regulatory  authority,  provided  to  demonstrate  no  meaningful  safety 
related difference between the cumulative dataset and the reference safety dataset. 
Patient exposure 
Overall, the median exposure to pembrolizumab was shorter in urothelial carcinoma patients compared to 
the Reference dataset (see Table below): 
Table 45: Summary of Drug Exposure 
Studies KN045, KN052, and Reference Safety Dataset 
(APaT Population) 
In study KEYNOTE-045 the duration of exposure was 3.45 months for the pembrolizumab arm at the last 
updated data Cut-off, with a median number of 6 administrations. At the initial data Cut-off, a total of 
139 (52.2%) and 95 (35.7%) subjects received pembrolizumab for ≥3 months and for ≥6 months, 
Assessment report  
EMA/512404/2017 
Page 104/146 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
respectively. The exposure to pembrolizumab was 1 year or longer for 43 (16 %) patients. In contrast, of 
the 255 subjects in the control arm, only 29 (11.4%) received treatment for ≥ 6 months and 3 (1.2%) 
received treatment for ≥ 12 months. 
The duration of exposure was similar in study KEYNOTE-052, with a median time on therapy of 3.40 
months and a median number of 5 administrations.At the initial data Cut-off, a total of 157 (42.4%) 
patients were treated for at least 3 months, 72 (19.5%) for at least 6 months and 9 (2.4%) patients 
exposed ≥ 1 year to pembrolizumab. 
In comparison to the reference safety dataset, patients in both KN-045 and KN-052 were mostly male 
(74.4% and 77.3%, respectively, versus 59.3%), older, as demonstrated by the higher percentage of 
subjects ≥65 years (61.3% and 81.6%, respectively, versus 43.3%), and had ECOG PS of 2 (1.5% and 
42.2%, respectively versus 0).  
Adverse events  
In both studies KN-045 and KN-052 pembrolizumab safety and tolerability has been evaluated during the 
treatment period up to two different cut-off dates, 7-Sep-2016 (Table 46) and 18-Jan-2017 (Table 47). 
Adverse events, which occurred from the first dose up to 30 days after the last dose, were reported and 
coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Version 19.0 and graded according to 
the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0.

The overall pembrolizumab safety profile favorably compares with chemotherapy in study KN045, with a 
lower rate of drug-related AEs (60.9% vs 90.2%), drug-related Grade≥3 AEs (15% vs 49.4%), serious 
drug-related AEs (10.2 vs 22.4%) and discontinuations due to drug-related AEs (11% vs 5.6%).

Across both studies in Urothelial cancer, Urinary tract infection and  Haematuria, as well as increase of 
Blood alkaline phosphatase  and Blood creatinine in study KN052, occurred more frequently than in the 
reference safety dataset. Upon medical review, these events were deemed unlikely related to 
pembrolizumab and more likely associated with the underlying disease condition, medical history, or 
medical procedures (eg, cystoscopy). None of these AEs represents a new safety signal for 
pembrolizumab. 
Grade 3-5 Adverse Events 
A lower rate of subjects in the pembrolizumab arm of Study KN045 experienced Grade ≥3 AEs (52.3%) 
compared to the control arm (62.7%). 
Table 50: Grade ≥3 Adverse Events (incidence ≥5% in One or More Groups) All Subjects in 
Study KN045 
(APaT Population) 
In  study  KN052,  53.8%  of  subjects  experienced  at  least  1  Grade  ≥3  AEs,  and  the  most  commonly 
reported were urinary tract infection (9.5%) and anemia (7.0%), see Table 51.

Drug-related Adverse Events 
In  Study  KN045,  fewer  subjects  in  the  pembrolizumab  arm  than  in  the  control  arm  experienced  drug-
related  AEs  (60.9%  vs  90.2%,  respectively).  In  the  pembrolizumab  arm,  the  most  frequently  observed 
drug-related AEs were Pruritus (19.5%), Fatigue (13.9%) and Nausea (10.9%). In the control arm, drug-
related AEs observed in ≥10% of the subjects were Alopecia (37.6%), Fatigue (27.8%), Anemia (24.7%), 
Nausea  (24.3%),  Constipation  (20.4%),  Decreased  appetite  (16.1%),  Neutropenia  (15.3%),  Asthenia 
(14.1%),  Neutrophil  count  decreased  (14.1%),  Diarrhea  (12.9%),  Peripheral  sensory  neuropathy 
(11.0%), and Neuropathy peripheral (10.6%). 
With the exception of Pruritus, all most common drug-related AEs observed in the pembrolizumab group 
were  reported  in  a lower or  similar  frequency  compared  to  control,  while  all most  common  drug-related 
AEs  observed  in  the  control  arm  were  reported  in  higher  or  similar  frequency  in  comparison  to  patients 
receiving pembrolizumab. 
In Study KN052, The most commonly reported drug-related AEs were Fatigue (16.8%), Pruritus (14.6%) 
and Rash (9.7%). 
Overall, the pattern of drug-related adverse events in KN045 and KN052 is comparable to the reference 
safety  dataset  as  shown  in  Table  52,  which  was  compiled  from  the  most  recent  data-cut-off  for  KN045 
and KN052 (18-Jan-2017 and 8-Mar-2017, respectively).

In  the  control  arm  of  Study  KN045,  treatment  was  interrupted  due  to  drug-related  AE  in  a  total  of  40 
(15.7%)  patients,  and  the  most  frequent  events  were  Anemia  (4.7%),  Neutropenia  (2.0%),  Asthenia 
(1.6%), Neutrophil count decrease (1.6%), and Infusion-related reaction (1.2%). 
Drug-related Grade 3-5 Adverse Events 
In  Study  KN045,  a  lower  frequency  of  subjects  in  the  pembrolizumab  arm  experienced  drug-related 
Grade ≥3 AEs compared to the control (15% vs 49.4%). In the pembrolizumab arm, the most commonly 
reported events were pneumonitis (1.5%), AST increased (1.1%), diarrhea (1.1%), and fatigue (1.1%) in 
the pembrolizumab arm, and neutropenia (13.3%), neutrophil count decreased (12.2%), anemia (7.8%), 
febrile  neutropenia  (7.1%),  and  white  blood  cell  decreased  (5.1%)  in  the  control  arm.  Two  Grade≥3 
Anemia  events  were  considered  drug-related  by  the  Investigator.  However,  based  on  evaluation  of  the 
available information for these events, they were finally deemed unlikely related to pembrolizumab, and 
more likely related to the underlying medical condition. 
All the drug-related Grade ≥3 AEs observed in ≥5% of subjects in the control arm were reported with a 
frequency < 1% in the pembrolizumab arm. 
In  Study  KN052,  15.7%  of  subjects  experienced  at  least  1  Grade  ≥3  AEs,  and  the  most  commonly 
reported were Fatigue (2.2%), Blood alkaline phosphatase increased (1.4%), Colitis (1.1%) and Muscular 
weakness (1.1%). There were no drug-related Grade≥ 3 AEs reported with incidence ≥3%. One Grade≥ 
3  Anemia  and  1  Grade≥  3  Urinary  tract  infection  were  considered  drug-related  by  the  Investigator. 
However,  upon  medical  review  of  the  available  information,  both  Anemia  and  Urinary  tract  infections 
cases were deemed more likely related to the underlying medical condition.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
Overall,  in  Study  KN045,  39.1%  of  patients  in  the  pembrolizumab  arm  and  40.8%  in  the  control  arm 
experienced at least 1 SAEs up to 90 days after the last dose of study treatment. In the pembrolizumab 
arm,  the  SAEs  observed  at  frequency  ≥1%  were  Urinary  tract  infection  (4.5%),  Pneumonia  (3.4%), 
Anemia  (2.6%),  Pneumonitis  (2.3%),  Hematuria  (1.9%),  Pyrexia  (1.9%),  Acute  kidney  injury  (1.5%), 
Cancer  pain  (1.5%),  Urosepsis  (1.5%),  Colitis  (1.5%),  Dehydration  (1.1%  vs  0.8%),  Diarrhea  (1.1%), 
Dyspnea  (1.1%),  Urinary  tract  obstruction  (1.1%),  Device  dislocation  (1.1%),  and  General  physical 
health deterioration (1.1%). With the exception of pneumonitis and colitis, all these events were reported 
in a lower or similar frequency in the pembrolizumab group compared to control. 
In the control arm, the SAE reported in ≥5% of subjects was febrile neutropenia (5.9%). 
Table  53  shows  the  subject  incidence  and  frequencies  of  drug-related  SAEs  observed  in  Study  KN045. 
Most of the events were reported once on both groups but pembrolizumab was associated with a higher 
frequency of immune-mediated pneumonitis compared to the control arm (Table 55)

In  Study  KN052,  the  frequency  of  subjects  with  1  or  more  SAEs  up  to  90  days  after  the  last 
pembrolizumab  dose  was  41.4%,  and  the  most  commonly  reported  events  were  Urinary  tract  infection

Deaths 
In  Study  KN045,  a  total  of  13  patients  (4.9%)  in  the  pembrolizumab  arm  and  8  patients  (3.1%)  in  the 
control group had AEs resulting in death within 90 days of the last dose (Table 55). 
Table 55: Subjects With Adverse Events Resulting in Death Up to 90 Days After Last Dose 
(Incidence >0% in One or More Treatment Groups) Study KN045 
All Subjects (APaT Population) 
Upon medical review, the fatal pneumonitis event was consistent with the previously described immune-
mediated  events  related  to  pembrolizumab.  Based  on  available  information,  the  remaining  AEs  with  a 
fatal outcome in subjects receiving pembrolizumab were deemed more likely related to either malignant 
neoplasm  progression,  infections  (common  among  subjects  with  cancer),  or  related  to  complication  of 
surgery  for  gastrointestinal  perforation.  No  new  safety  signal  was  identified  upon  review  of  these  fatal 
events. 
In Study KN052, 18 (4.9%) patients died due to an AE during the trial. A summary of all AEs resulting in 
death is provided in the following Table (Table 56).

Table 56: Subjects With Adverse Events Resulting in Death Up to 90 Days After Last Dose 
(Incidence >0%) Study KN052 
All Subjects (APaT Population) 
All  fatal  events,  including  those  reported  only  once,  were  medically  reviewed.  The  only  fatal  event 
reported as drug-related by the Investigator refers to a patient  who developed Thyroiditis (Grade 3 with 
hyperthyroidism  followed  by  hypothyroidism),  immune-mediated  Myositis  (Grade  5),  Myocarditis  (Grade 
4),  Hepatitis  (Grade  3)  and  Pneumonia  (Grade  3),  approximately  20  days  after  initiation  of 
pembrolizumab.  Despite  treatment,  including  steroid  therapy,  IV  immunoglobulin  and  thyroid  hormone 
replacement,  the  subject  experienced  respiratory  insufficiency  and  pneumonia  with  a  fatal  outcome.  In 
total, the patient received 2 doses prior to drug discontinuation. The Investigator considered the SAEs of 
thyroiditis,  myositis,  myocarditis,  hepatitis,  and  pneumonia  to  be  immune  related,  related  to  the  study 
therapy,  and  events  of  clinical  interest.  According  to  the  MAH,  the  available  information  permit  to 
conclude the correlation of the reported SAEs Thyroiditis and Myositis with pembrolizumab administration, 
while SAEs of Hepatitis and Myocarditis were not related to pembrolizumab considering that there was no 
biopsy  confirming  the  immune  mediated  nature  of  these  events.  This  is  the  first  reported  fatal  case  of 
Myositis with pembrolizumab. 
For the remaining cases,  based on available information, the fatal outcomes of Pneumonia (3 subjects), 
Urosepsis  (3  subjects),  and  Sepsis  (2  subjects)  were  more  likely  related  to  the  underlying  medical 
condition or confounded by a medical procedure.

Two additional fatal cases (PTs septic shock and malignant neoplasm progression; PT Clostridium difficile 
infection) were reported at the updated safety analysis. 
No  new  safety  signal  was  identified  upon  review  of  the  fatal  events  reported  in  both  Study  KN045  and 
Study KN052. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AEOSI) 
The AEOSI, including immune-mediated AEs and infusion-related reactions considered to be identified or 
potential risk for pembrolizumab, are characterized in an ongoing manner as part of the pembrolizumab 
development program. A pre-specified list of PTs was developed for assessing AEOSI.

Table 58: Subjects with AEOSI (Incidence>0% in One or More Treatment Group) Study KN052 
All Subjects (APaT Population) 
In general, the frequency  and severity of each AEOSI observed in Study KN045 and KN052 were in line 
with  the  previously  described  characterization  of  the  pembrolizumab  safety  profile.  No  new  immune-
mediated event causally associated with pembrolizumab and indication-specific was identified.  
One fatal case each was reported in Study KN045 (Pneumonitis) and in Study KN052 (Myositis). 
Laboratory findings 
Laboratory abnormalities were analysed based on the highest CTCAE grade reported for each subject, in 
order to assess the clinically meaningful changes from baseline, defined as a shift from less than Grade 3 
to Grade≥ 3 or a shift from Grade 0 to Grade 2.

In  the  pembrolizumab  arm  of  Study  KN045,  the  most  frequently  reported  laboratory  values  with  a 
clinically  meaningful  worsening  in  CTCAE  grade  from  baseline  were  Lymphocytes  decreased  (25.6%), 
Phosphate decreased (23.7%). The rate of these laboratory abnormalities was higher in the control arm 
(34.9%  and  27.5%,  respectively).  Additional  laboratory  findings  with  a  clinically  meaningful  worsening 
most  commonly  observed  in  the  control  group  were  Neutrophils  decreased  (52.2%)  and  Leukocytes 
decreased (47.8%).  
In  Study  KN052,  the  most  common  clinically  meaningful  worsened  laboratory  values  were  Lymphocytes 
decreased (21.9%)  and Albumin decreased (13.8%). The most frequent liver function finding observed 
was Alkaline phosphatase ≥1.5 ULN (24.5%).  
As  concern  the  liver  functioning  test,  in  both  studies  the  most  frequent  finding  observed  was  Alkaline 
phosphatase ≥1.5 ULN (31.6% with pembrolizumab and 28.5% in the control group in KN045; 24.5% in 
KN052). Overall, no liver function abnormalities consistent with severe drug injury (Hy’s Law: AST or ALT 
≥3 ULN, total bilirubin ≥2 ULN and an alkaline phosphatase <2 X ULN) were reported. However, 4 (1.6%) 
subjects  in  the  control  arm  and  8  (3.2%)  subjects  in  the  pembrolizumab  arm  of  Study  KN045,  and  4 
(1.1%)  patients  in  Study KN052  had  either  an  AST  or  ALT  value  ≥3  ULN  with  a  total  bilirubin  value  ≥2 
ULN. 
The  frequency  of  subjects  with  clinically  meaningful  worsening  in  laboratory  CTCAE  grades  in  Study 
KN045, Study KN052 and in the reference safety data set is reported in the below Table (Table 59)

Gender 
Pembrolizumab was similarly well tolerated in either male or female patients enrolled in Study KN045, on 
the  basis  of  lower  frequency  of  drug-related  AEs,  Grade≥  3  AEs,  Grade≥3  drug-related  AEs,  and  drug-
related SAEs (Table 62). 
Table 62: Adverse Events Summary by Gender Study KN045 -All Subjects 
(APaT Population) 
The  frequency  of  AEs  by  Gender  in  Study  KN045  population  was  similar  to  that  in  the  Reference  Safety 
Dataset,  while  female  patients  in  Study  KN052  experienced  a  higher  rate  of  SAEs  and  Grade  ≥3  AEs  in 
comparison to those in the reference safety dataset (50% vs 35.5% and 63.1% vs 45.1%, respectively. 
These  findings  should  be  evaluated  with  caution  given  the  low  number  of  females  (n=84)  in  Study 
KN052. 
ECOG Status 
Pembrolizumab  was  consistently  well  tolerated  in  ECOG  PS  0  or  ECOG  PS  1  patients  treated  in  Study 
KN045, with a better tolerability profile in both subgroups in terms of drug-related AEs, Grade ≥3 drug-
related AEs, and drug-related SAEs, compared to the control (Table 63).

(APaT Population) 
In general, the overall frequency of  AEs in patients with ECOG-PS 0 or 1 reported in both Study KN045 
and Study KN052 was similar to the Reference Safety Dataset for these respective groups. 
Patients  with  ECOG  PS  2  were  only  included  in  Study  KN052,  and  therefore  the  comparison  of  AEs 
frequency versus the Reference Safety Dataset cannot be made (Table 64).

(APaT Population) 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In Study KN045, a total of 22 (8.3%) patients in the pembrolizumab arm and 32 (12.5%) patients in the 
control group had an AE resulting in treatment discontinuation. The most common AEs leading to 
discontinuation were Pneumonitis (1.9%) in patients treated with pembrolizumab, and Peripheral sensory 
neuropathy (2.0%) and Neuropathy peripheral (1.6%) in patients who received chemotherapy. 
In Study KN052, a total of 41 (11.1%) subjects discontinued treatment due to AEs. None of these events 
was reported in a frequency >1%. 
Immunogenicity 
A total of 3727 subjects were included in the immunogenicity assessment across indications (1,535 
melanoma, 1,238 NSCLC, 101 HNSCC, 54 MSI-H, 220 HL, and 579 urothelial carcinoma subjects) and 
across doses (at 2 mg/kg Q3W, 10 mg/kg Q3W/ Q2W, and 200 mg Q3W).  
The observed frequency of treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies (ADA) in evaluable subjects from 
this pooled analysis across indications is 1.8% (36 out of 2034). Exposure to pembrolizumab was not 
compromised by the observed immune response. Indeed, in the 36 subjects with a treatment-emergent 
immunogenicity response pembrolizumab exposure was in the range of those observed for non-positive 
subjects treated with pembrolizumab in the same regimen. The treatment emergent positive subjects did 
not have any AEs associated with neutralizing antibodies, such as hypersensitivity events (e.g. 
anaphylaxis, urticaria, angioedema) or injection site reactions.  
Assessment report  
EMA/512404/2017 
Page 126/146 
 
  
  
 
In the subgroup of urothelial carcinoma subjects (pooled across KN012, KN045 and KN052), the incidence 
for treatment-emergent ADA in evaluable subjects is 1.4% (7 of 509; 497 negative, 5 non-treatment 
emergent positive and 7 treatment emergent positive), in line with the overall incidence.   
Post marketing experience 
The Keytyruda Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR), covering the reporting period 04 March 2016 to 
03 September 2016, has been just reviewed by the PRAC. Assessment of the signal for sarcoidosis led to 
the conclusion that a causal association cannot be excluded and reflection in the SmPC and Package 
Leaflet was requested accordingly.  
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  pembrolizumab  safety  profile  in  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  urothelial  carcinoma  has  been 
presented in 266 subjected previously treated with platinum-containing chemotherapy (study KEYNOTE-
045), and in 370 patients previously untreated and cisplatin-ineligible (study KEYNOTE-052). In addition, 
safety data from a Reference Safety Dataset including overall 3,194 patients treated with pembrolizumab 
across  different  trials  (studies  KEYNOTE-001,  KEYNOTE-002  and  KEYNOTE-006  in  melanoma;  studies 
KEYNOTE-001,  KEYNOTE-010  and  KEYNOTE-024  in  NSCLC;  studies  KEYNOTE-013  Cohort  3  and 
KEYNOTE-087  in  Hodgkin’s  Lymphoma)  have  been  submitted,  in  order  to  allow  a  comparison  with  the 
already  established  pembrolizumab  safety  profile.  At  a  median  follow  up  of  12  months  in  study  KN045 
and  of  11  months  in  study  KN052,  a  shorter  median  time  on  therapy  was  reported  in  both  KN045  and 
KN052  studies  compared  to  the  Reference  Safety  Dataset  (3.45  months  and  3.40  respectively,  versus 
4.86 months), resulting into a reduced number of administered doses ( 6 and 5 respectively, versus 8).  
Consistently with the epidemiologic pattern of urothelial carcinoma, in comparison to the reference safety 
dataset, patients in both KN-045 and KN-052 were mostly male (74.4% and 77.3%, respectively, versus 
59.3%), and ≥65 years (61.3% and 81.6%, respectively, versus 43.3%). ECOG PS2 patients were 42.2% 
in Study KN-052 and 1.5% in Study KN-045 
In  study  KN045,  pembrolizumab  treatment  favorably  compares  with  chemotherapy  in  terms  of    drug-
related  AEs  (60.9%  vs  90.2%),  Grade≥3  AEs  (52.3%  vs  62.7%),  drug-related  Grade≥3  AEs  (15%  vs 
49.4%),  serious  drug-related  AEs  (10.2  vs  22.4%),  treatment  interruption  due  to  drug-related  AEs 
(10.5% vs 15.7%) and treatment discontinuation due to drug-related AEs (11% vs 5.6%). As expected, 
pembrolizumab  showed  a  well  different  safety  profile  compared  to  chemotherapy,  with  a  higher  rate  in 
the control arm of AEs in SOCs General disorders and administration site conditions (72.2% vs 57.5%), 
Gastrointestinal  disorders  (68.2%  vs  56.4%),  Blood  and  lymphatic  system  disorders  (51%  vs  19.9%), 
Nervous  system  disorders  (41.2%  vs  21.8%)  and  Investigations  (34.9%  vs  28.9%),  and  a  higher 
frequency in pembrolizumab arm of AEs in SOCs Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (42.5% 
vs  37.3%),  Respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders  (34.2%  vs  29.4%),  Renal  and  urinary 
disorders  (27.1%  vs  17.6%)  and  Endocrine  disorders  (10.5%  vs  1.6%).  Among  the  most  common  PTs, 
Pruritus and Decreased appetite were the only registered at higher frequency in the pembrolizumab arm 
(23.3% vs 5.5% and 21.1% vs 20.8%, respectively). In terms of drug-related AEs, the most frequently 
observed events in the pembrolizumab arm were Pruritus (19.5%), Fatigue (13.9%) and Nausea (10.9%) 
while  in  the  control  arm  patients  mostly  experienced  Alopecia  (37.6%),  Fatigue  (27.8%),  Anemia 
(24.7%),  Nausea  (24.3%),  Constipation  (20.4%),  Decreased  appetite  (16.1%),  Neutropenia  (15.3%), 
Asthenia  (14.1%),  Neutrophil  count  decreased  (14.1%),  Diarrhea  (12.9%),  Peripheral  sensory 
neuropathy (11.0%), and Neuropathy peripheral (10.6%). 
Overall, in patients treated with pembrolizumab, no major differences in the safety profile were observed 
between  both  populations  in  studies  KN045  and  KN052  and  in  the  Reference  Safety  Dataset.  The 
Assessment report

frequency and severity of AEOSI in both UC populations were also in line with those previously described. 
However, a higher frequency of Urinary tract infection and Haematuria was registered across UC studies 
in comparison to the Reference Safety Dataset, together with an increase of Blood alkaline phosphatase 
and  Blood  creatinine  specifically  in  study  KN052.  Urinary  tract  infection  was  also  the  most  commonly 
reported Grade≥3 AE (9.5%) in study KN052.  Even though the underlying disease condition can possibly 
explain the higher than previously reported rate of these AEs, the contribution of pembrolizumab cannot 
be  ignored:  in  the  comparative  study  KN045,  patients  treated  with  pembrolizumab  experienced  more 
frequently  that  those  treated  with  chemotherapy  Acute  kidney  injury  (5.6%  vs  2.7%),  Haematuria 
(11.3%  vs  7.8%)  and  Urinary  tract  infection  (14.7%  vs  13.3%).  In  study  KN052,  consistently  with  the 
Reference  Safety  Dataset,  the  most  commonly  reported  drug-related  AEs  were  Fatigue  (16.8%  and 
24.2%),  Pruritus  (14.6%  and  16.7%)  and  Rash  (9.7%  and  13.8%).  Pneumonitis  and  Colitis  were  the 
most common drug-related SAEs in KN045 (1.9% and 1.5%) and in the Reference Safety Dataset (1.6% 
and 0.9%). 
Overall, a total of 31 fatal cases, 13 in study KN045 and 18 in study KN052, occurred within 90 days from 
the last pembrolizumab dose. The frequency of patients with AE leading to fatal outcome was comparable 
in  KN045  (4.9%),  KN052  (4.9%)  and  in  the  Reference  Safety  Dataset  (3.9%),  even  though  a  higher 
number of deaths was reported in cisplatin-ineligible patients compared to platinum-pretreated ones. This 
difference  can  be  explained  considering  the  baseline  characteristics  of  the  patient  population  in  study 
KN052. Indeed, 15 out of the 18 dead patients were ≥65 years old, including 10 patients aged ≥75 years 
and 4 patients older than 85 years. No new safety signal was identified from fatal cases. One AEOSI with 
fatal  outcome  was  reported  each  in  Study  KN045  (Pneumonitis)  and  in  Study  KN052  (Myositis);  while 
fatal Pneumonitis events were already reported, this is the first fatal case of Myositis and the information 
has been included in Section 4.4 of the SmPC.   
The  frequency  of  clinically  meaningful  laboratory  abnormalities  was  overall  comparable  among  Study 
KN045,  Study  KN052  and    the  reference  safety  data  set,  with  the  exception  of  Albumin  decreased, 
Creatinine  increased,  Haemoglobin  decreased  that  were  more  pronounced  in  the  urothelial  cancer 
population possibly due to the baseline medical condition. 
No  major  and  unexpected  differences  in  the  tolerability  of  pembrolizumab  treatment  were  observed 
across the different classes of age (<65 years, ≥65 to <75 years,≥75 to <85 years, ≥85 years), ECOG 
Performance  Status  categories  (PS  0/1),  and  gender  (Male/Female).  ECOG  PS≥2  patients  were  only 
included  in  Study  KN052.  Based  on  the  overall  157  patients  included,  no  impact  on  the  pembrolizumab 
tolerability can be assumed. 
In the application which was submitted also a change to section 4.4 of the SmPC was proposed, adding 
possible  hypersensitivity  and  anaphylaxis  as  part  of  infusion  reactions.  These  changes  have  been 
considered acceptable and were included in the SmPC. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall,  the  safety  profile  of  pembrolizumab  in  the  UC  population  does  not  seem  to  be  significantly 
influenced  by  prior  platinum-treatment  (KN045)  or  baseline  patient  characteristics  leading  to  cisplatin-
ineligibility (KN052). Available safety data are in general consistent with those previously reported in the 
SmPC.  New  warnings  were  added  under  section  4.4  regarding  the  delayed  onset  of  the  effect  of 
pembrolizumab to be considered when treating patients with poorer prognosis; the lack of data in frailer 
patients  (e.g  ECOG  ≥3)  ineligible  for  chemotherapy  and  the  first  reported  fatal  case  of  myositis.  The 
incidences of adverse reactions under section 4.8 of the SmPC were updated to reflect the totality of the 
data.

The risk minimisation measures have not changed. The existing risk minimisation measures remain 
sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed indication. 
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of these new indications, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been 
updated and the Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. Further,  a change to section 4.4 of the 
SmPC adding possible hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis as part of infusion reactions, have been included. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the applicant. Even though the justification can be considered in principle 
acceptable due to the limited changes to the package leaflet, since the readability test was performed 
several modification have been implemented based on variations.  
The CHMP recommends an abridged testing of the current version of the package leaflet and Instruction 
for HPs should be performed with the next relevant submitted variation. This testing on package leaflet 
should be carried out with 5 participants (patients or caregivers) for each round (two); moreover, at least 
three HPs should be involved for an abridged test focused on the Instructions for preparation and 
administration and posology section. The relevant questions of the initial questionnaire should be used to 
reflect all amendments adequately.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
KEYTRUDA as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial 
carcinoma in adults who have received prior chemotherapy. 
The MAH agrees to revise the above indication taking into account that only patients previously treated 
with platinum-based chemotherapy were included in the pivotal trial (revised indication: “KEYTRUDA as 
monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma in 
adults who were previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy”.) 
KEYTRUDA as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial 
carcinoma in adults who are not eligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Failing first-line platinum-based chemotherapy, the prognosis is compromised with a median OS reduced 
to 5 to 7 months (Bellmunt J, J Clin Oncol 2009). In this setting, there is no globally recognized standard 
of care. Vinflunine is the only drug approved in EU. 
More than 50% of patients are unfit for cisplatin due to poor performance status, impaired renal function, 
or specific comorbidities. For these patients, NCCN Guidelines (version 2.2017) and ESMO Practice 
Guideline (Bellmunt J, Annals of Oncology 2014) recommend carboplatin-based regimens or single agent 
taxane or gemcitabine. A median OS of 9 months has been reported with the carboplatin/gemcitabine 
combination (De Santis M, J Clin Oncol 2012). In case of patients with PS ≥2 and poor renal function, the 
participation in clinical trials or BSC is recommended by ESMO guidelines. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma progressing after prior chemotherapy  
To support this indication, results of a phase III randomized (1:1) open-label clinical trial (KEYNOTE-045) 
of pembrolizumab versus Investigator’s choice (paclitaxel, docetaxel or vinflunine) in 542 subjects with 
recurrent or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who experienced progression after a platinum-based 
regimen, enrolled regardless PD-L1 expression status were provided.  
Previously untreated cisplatin-ineligible advanced/unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma 
To support this indication, results of a phase II single-arm clinical trial (KEYNOTE-052) of pembrolizumab 
in 370 cisplatin-ineligible subjects with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma, 
enrolled regardless PD-L1 expression status were provided.  
In order to provide information for contextualization of the results in cisplatin ineligible patients, the MAH 
conducted and provided a systematic literature review and meta-analysis. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma progressing after prior chemotherapy  
Assessment report  
EMA/512404/2017 
Page 136/146 
 
  
  
Overall, a statistically significant gain of 3 months in OS is reported in the overall population (HR:0.73, 
95% CI 0.59, 0.91, p=0.002). The median OS in the chemotherapy arm (7.4 months, 95% CI 6.1, 8.3) is 
consistent with historical data from single-agent second line treatment. Consistently, a significant OS 
increase was observed in PD-L1 strongly positive patients treated with pembrolizumab compared to 
chemotherapy (HR:0.57, 95% CI 0.37, 0.88, p=0.004). In addition, even though p-value was not 
multiplicity-adjusted, results in PD-L1 positive patients showed a similar magnitude of OS benefit 
(HR:0.61, 95% CI 0.43, 0.86, p=0.002) compared to PD-L1 strongly positive. A prolonged time to 
deterioration in EORTC QLQ-C30 global health status/QoL was observed for patients treated with 
pembrolizumab compared to chemotherapy (HR 0.70; 95% CI 0.55-0.90) which remained at over 15 
weeks of follow-up. 
Previously untreated cisplatin-ineligible advanced/unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma 
An ORR of 24.1% (95% CI 19.8, 28.7) was reported in the overall population. In 282 PD-L1 positive 
patients ORR was 26.6% (95% CI 21.5, 32.2). When considering the subgroup of PD-L1 strongly positive 
patients from the validation cohort, a higher ORR of 38.8% (95% CI 28.1, 50.3) was reported. 
Response rates improved with longer follow and responses remained durable (see efficacy results of 
updated analyses in effects tables below). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma progressing after prior chemotherapy   
An excess of deaths in the pembrolizumab arm was observed in the first two months (43 in 
pembrolizumab vs. 24 in control arm) leading to an initial favourable effect for the control arm in OS K-M 
curves, followed by a crossing around 3-4 months from the start of treatment. In this regard, liver 
metastases and time from most recent prior therapy of < 3 months were identified as possible factors 
associated to the higher risk of early death. Hence, a warning has been added in section 4.4 of the SmPC 
as follows: “Physicians should consider the delayed onset of pembrolizumab effect before initiating 
treatment in patients with poorer prognostic features and/or aggressive disease. In urothelial cancer, a 
higher number of deaths within 2 months were observed in pembrolizumab compared to chemotherapy 
(see section 5.1).”   
Improvement in patient-reported outcomes by EORTC QLQ-C30 such as prolonged time to deterioration 
in EORTC QLQ-C30 global health status/QoL was observed for patients treated with pembrolizumab 
compared to investigator’s choice chemotherapy (HR 0.70; 95% CI 0.55-0.90) and its maintenance over 
15 weeks of follow-up, was a significant result, however such results should be interpreted in the context 
of the open-label study design and therefore taken cautiously (See SmPC). 
Previously untreated cisplatin-ineligible advanced/unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma 
Only data from an uncontrolled trial (KN052) were submitted to support this indication. A systematic 
review and meta-analysis of the literature was performed, however this systematic review presents some 
limitations. Taking into account the historical data in the target population, observed ORR data are not 
that compelling, even in the PD-L1 strongly positive cohort. Data on the median duration of response 
compare favourably, but are still immature. The same applies for time to event endpoints PFS and OS. 
Moreover the duration of follow-up is still insufficient. Efficacy updates will be provided with the final CSR 
(see RMP). 
Unmet medical need is considered high in UC in general, but new therapies would be especially needed 
for cisplatin-ineligible and chemotherapy-ineligible patients; however these patients are not represented 
in the study population of KN-052, hence the following warning has been added in section 4.4 of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/512404/2017 
Page 137/146 
 
  
  
SmPC: “ The baseline and prognostic disease characteristics of the study population of KEYNOTE-052 
included a proportion of patients eligible for a carboplatin-based combination or mono-chemotherapy. In 
the absence of comparative data, pembrolizumab should be used with caution in this population after 
careful consideration of the potential risk-benefit on an individual basis.”  
Results from the on-going randomized studies P045, P052 and P361 and are requested as part of a Post-
Authorisation Efficacy Study (PAES). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In patients previously treated with platinum-containing chemotherapy (study KN045), pembrolizumab 
favorably compares with chemotherapy in terms of drug-related AEs (60.9% vs 90.2%), Grade≥3 AEs 
(52.3% vs 62.7%), drug-related Grade≥3 AEs (15% vs 49.4%), serious drug-related AEs (10.2 vs 
22.4%), treatment interruption due to drug-related AEs (10.5% vs 15.7%) and treatment discontinuation 
due to drug-related AEs (11% vs 5.6%). In terms of drug-related AEs, the most frequently observed 
events in the pembrolizumab arm were Pruritus (19.5%), Fatigue (13.9%) and Nausea (10.9%) while in 
the control arm patients mostly experienced Alopecia (37.6%), Fatigue (27.8%), Anemia (24.7%), 
Nausea (24.3%), Constipation (20.4%), Decreased appetite (16.1%), Neutropenia (15.3%), Asthenia 
(14.1%), Neutrophil count decreased (14.1%), Diarrhea (12.9%), Peripheral sensory neuropathy 
(11.0%), and Neuropathy peripheral (10.6%). 
In UC patients treated with pembrolizumab, no major differences in the safety profile were observed 
despite prior treatment and eligibility to cisplatin in studies KN045 and KN052 and in comparison to the 
Reference Safety Dataset. In study KN052, consistently with the Reference Safety Dataset, the most 
commonly reported drug-related AEs were Fatigue (16.8% and 24.2%), Pruritus (14.6% and 16.7%) and 
Rash (9.7% and 13.8%). 
One fatal case of myositis was reported in KN052. This is the first registered with pembrolizumab. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
A higher number of deaths within 2 months was observed in pembrolizumab compared to chemotherapy 
which was attributed to the delayed onset of effect of pembrolizumab; this factor should be considered 
before initiating treatment in patients with poorer prognostic features and/or aggressive disease (see 
SmPC section 4.4).  
No safety and efficacy data are available in frailer patients (e.g., ECOG performance status 3) considered 
not eligible for chemotherapy. In the SmPC section 4.4 it is stated that in the absence of these data, 
pembrolizumab should be used with caution in this population after careful consideration of the potential 
risk-benefit on an individual basis. 
Longer safety follow up is needed and will be provided with the final reports from studies 045 and 052. 
Additional safety information for pembrolizumab with or without Platinum-Based Combination 
Chemotherapy versus Chemotherapy in advanced or metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma, will be provided 
with the results of study P361.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma progressing after prior chemotherapy  
Pembrolizumab favorably compares with chemotherapy in terms of drug-related AEs (60.9% vs 90.2%), 
Grade≥3  AEs  (52.3%  vs  62.7%),  drug-related  Grade≥3  AEs  (15%  vs  49.4%),  serious  drug-related  AEs 
(10.2  vs  22.4%),  treatment  interruption  due  to  drug-related  AEs  (10.5%  vs  15.7%)  and  treatment 
discontinuation due to drug-related AEs (11% vs 5.6%). No major differences in the safety profile were 
observed in comparison to the Reference Safety Dataset.  
Previously untreated cisplatin-ineligible advanced/unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma 
The  effect  observed  in  terms  ORR  in  the  uncontrolled  trial  KN052  is  not  outstanding  compared  to 
historical  data  in  the  target  population,  even  in  the  PD-L1  strongly  positive  cohort.  Data  on  the  median 
Duration  of  Response  and  other  time  to  event  endpoints  PFS  and  OS  are  still  immature  to  draw  sound 
conclusions. 
The  safety  profile  observed  in  cisplatin  ineligible  UC  patients  was  consistent  to  that  observed  in  study 
KN045, and no new safety signals emerged compared to the Reference Safety Dataset.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma progressing after prior chemotherapy   
Based on OS results from study KN045, a benefit is claimed in the overall population. However, patients’ 
characteristics influencing a higher risk of early death during treatment need to be further discussed, in 
order to include detailed information in the product SmPC.  
The safety profile in the UC patient population does not significantly differ from the well-known limited 
risks associated with pembrolizumab therapy, far more manageable and less impacting on patients’ 
quality of life than those associated with chemotherapy.  
Previously untreated cisplatin-ineligible advanced/unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma 
However, duration of responses is clearly superior and OS compares rather favourable to those achieved 
by chemotherapy in the submitted meta-analysis.  
The safety profile in the sought indication does not raise new concerns and seems to favorably compare 
to chemotherapy.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
Based on the totality of the evidence, the benefit-risk balance of the use of pembrolizumab in 2nd line UC 
and in 1st line cisplatin-ineligible UC is considered positive.

As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated and the Package 
Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Further, the MAH is taking the opportunity to implement a change to section 4.4 of the SmPC adding 
possible hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis as part of infusion reactions 
In addition, Annex II has been updated to include new Post-authorisation efficacy studies (PAES) as 
obligations under ‘conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal 
product’.  
An updated RMP version 7.2 was agreed during the procedure. 
This recommendation is subject to the following new conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Obligation to conduct post-authorisation measures  
The MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the below measures:

Additional biomarkers other than PD-L1 expression status by 
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) (e.g. PD-L2, RNA signature, etc.) predictive of 
pembrolizumab efficacy should be investigated together with more information 
regarding the pattern of expression of PD-L1  obtained in the ongoing NSCLC 
studies (P001, P010, P024 and P042)  
and urothelial carcinoma studies (KN045, KN052):

DIVERGENT POSITION DATED 20 July 2017 
Keytruda EMEA/H/C/003820/II/23/G 
The undersigned members of the CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s positive opinion recommending the 
extension of the indication for Keytruda (pembrolizumab) in the 1st-line cisplatin-ineligible urothelial 
carcinoma (UC) for the following reasons: 
•  Current evidence on efficacy and safety in first-line cisplatin-ineligible patients only comprises a 
single-arm study, i.e. KEYNOTE-052. Upon indirect comparison of the Keytruda results obtained 
the first-line cisplatin-ineligible urothelial carcinoma population to control (i.e. gemcitabine-
carboplatin) chemotherapy), the primary endpoint ORR results are not compelling and PFS 
compares unfavourably. Depending on the source of information, the OS of Keytruda compares 
either unfavourably or is suggested being similar. DoR is still immature.  Moreover, the lack of 
direct comparative efficacy data with first line agents precludes a determination of the extent of 
any potential “loss of chance”, in particular for the patients who do not respond to Keytruda.   
It is acknowledged that safety seems to be more favourable when compared to chemotherapy. 
• 
In conclusion, we consider that in the 1st-line cisplatin-ineligible UC population the results 
obtained with Keytruda are on itself not convincing and accompanied with large uncertainties 
associated with the single, non-comparative study design and a limited duration of follow-up. The 
current evidence is not compelling enough to support a positive B/R and, as a consequence, 
considered insufficient for approval.

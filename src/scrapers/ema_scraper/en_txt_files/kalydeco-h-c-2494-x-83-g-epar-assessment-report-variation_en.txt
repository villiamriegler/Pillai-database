consisting of an extension of the marketing authorisation and the following variations: 
Variation(s) requested 
Type 
C.I.6.a 
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new 
II 
therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one 
Extension application to add a new strength of 75 mg film-coated tablets of ivacaftor to enable 
administration to patients aged 6 to less than 11 years grouped with an extension of indication - 
C.I.6.a - To update sections 4.1, 4.2 and 6.5 of the SmPC, and sections 1 and 2 of the PL for the 150 
mg film-coated tablet presentations to extend the indication for use in children aged 6 to less than 12 
years old in combination with  tezacaftor/ivacaftor and to bring it in line with the new dosage form (75 
mg film-coated tablets of ivacaftor). The RMP (version 8.6) is updated in accordance. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to implement minor updates in the Product Information. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 7.2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008 – Group of variations 
Kalydeco, was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/08/556 on 25 July 2012 in the 
following condition: Treatment of cystic fibrosis.  
The new indication, which is the subject of this application, falls within the above-mentioned orphan 
designation. 
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan 
Medicinal Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Kalydeco as an orphan medicinal product in the 
approved indication. The outcome of the COMP review can be found here <insert link>

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
The MAH applied for a new strength (75mg tablets) to be used in a new indication in combination with 
Symkevi in children from 6 to less than 12 years.  
The MAH did not apply for the use of this new strength (75 mg tablets) in the other indication (as 
monotherapy) of Kalydeco for children weighing at least 14 kg to less than 25 kg. 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease with serious, chronically debilitating morbidities 
and high premature mortality, and at present, there is no cure. CF is caused by mutations in the CFTR 
gene that result in absent or deficient function of the CFTR protein at the cell surface. The CFTR protein 
is an epithelial chloride channel responsible for aiding in the regulation of salt and water absorption 
and secretion. The failure to regulate chloride transport in these organs results in the multisystem 
pathology associated with CF.  
In CF patients, loss of chloride transport due to defects in the CFTR protein result in the accumulation 
of thick, sticky mucus in the bronchi of the lungs, loss of exocrine pancreatic function, impaired 
intestinal absorption, reproductive dysfunction, and elevated sweat chloride concentration.  
The biochemical defect of defective chloride channel function is present from birth, with the sequelae of 
lung, pancreatic and other organ involvement emerging progressively throughout childhood and into 
adulthood.  
The disease phenotype differs considerably among patients, even among patients with the same 
genotype. The CFTR genotype primarily determines the degree of pancreatic exocrine dysfunction, 
sweat chloride concentration and malformation of the male reproductive tract. However, factors 
independent of the CFTR genotype are responsible for variation in lung disease, the primary cause of 
morbidity and mortality in CF. In lung disease, environmental factors, socio-economic factors and also 
the presence of modifier genes play an important role. Lung disease is the primary cause of morbidity 
and mortality in people with CF. However, CF is a systemic disease and complications such as cystic 
fibrosis-related diabetes and cystic fibrosis-related liver disease have emerged as important causes of 
morbid-mortality which are usually present in the paediatric age.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
CF affects approximately 30,000 individuals in the United States (US) and 32,000 in the EU. The 
incidence and prevalence of CF vary between racial groups; CF is considerably more common in the 
Caucasian populations of North America and Europe than in Asian and African populations.  
The most common mutation is the F508del mutation. About 50% of the CF population is homozygous 
for the F508del mutation, while this allele is present in at least 70% of the overall CF population. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
The CFTR protein is an epithelial chloride ion (CL-) channel located in the epithelia of multiple organs, 
including lungs, pancreas, intestinal tract, liver, and vas deferens, that is responsible for aiding in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/628136/2020  
Page 8/117 
 
 
 
regulation of salt and water absorption and secretion. More than 1900 mutations in the CFTR gene 
have been identified.  
CFTR mutations can be classified according to the mechanisms by which they disrupt CFTR function. 
Stop codon mutations (class I) result in a truncated non-functional CFTR, class II mutations consist of 
aberrantly folded CFTR protein that is degraded by the cell quality control system, while class III 
mutations lead to defective regulation of the CFTR protein and, consequently, the absence of CFTR 
function. These three classes usually lead to a classic CF phenotype with pancreatic insufficiency. CFTR 
mutations that lead to defective chloride conductance are grouped together in class IV. Class V 
mutations interfere with normal transcription, thereby reducing the amount of otherwise normal CFTR. 
These latter two classes are mostly associated with a milder expression of the disease.  
CF-causing mutations can be divided into 2 groups based on the extent of loss of chloride transport 
caused by the mutation. A complete or near complete loss of CFTR chloride transport is referred to as 
“minimal function” of CFTR. A less complete loss of CFTR-mediated chloride transport is referred to as 
“residual function” of CFTR.  
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
The median predicted survival for CF patients in the US was 39.3 years (95% CI, 37.3-41.4) according 
to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation 2014 Registry Report.  
The classic or typical form of CF is diagnosed if a patient demonstrates clinical disease in one or more 
organ systems and has elevated sweat chloride (≥60 mmol/L). Most of these patients have disease 
manifestations in multiple organ systems (pancreas, upper and lower respiratory tract, and male 
reproductive tract).  
The prevalence of certain CF complications varies according to the age group. Exocrine pancreatic 
insufficiency is often already present from birth or develops in infancy. CF related liver cirrhosis 
clinically presents most frequently between the ages of 5 to 15 years, but with a lower frequency in the 
third decade. CF related pulmonary disease mostly starts in childhood. CF related diabetes often starts 
to develop in patients around the age of 10 years and may progress in severity over years to insulin 
dependency. Lung disease is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in CF. 
The natural course of lung disease in CF is shown in Figure 1. In CF, the early lung damage starts in 
the peripheral, small airways due to the long-standing inflammation caused by the defect CFTR 
channel. This early deterioration of the small airways results in ventilation inhomogeneity which can be 
measured by the lung clearance index. Upon progression of the disease, also the larger airways will 
become affected. These larger airways abnormalities can be more easily measured by the FEV1.

Page 9/117 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1 The natural course of progression of the pulmonary CF 
Indeed, in children, the lung function as judged by FEV1 is often preserved, but peripheral airways 
disease is shown by an abnormal Lung clearance index (LCI). The deterioration of LCI reflects disease 
progression. Lung Clearance Index 2.5 (LCI2.5) correlates well with FEV1, although it is abnormal at an 
earlier stage in the disease course. Therefore, the LCI can be used to measure airways disease in CF 
children, although the minimal clinically important difference is not known. The lung function as 
measured by FEV1 is often preserved until adolescence. During adolescence, the lung function also 
starts to decline as measured by FEV1. Most adults with CF have either moderate or severe lung 
disease as measured by an impaired FEV1.  
CF is included in many newborn screening programs. More than 80% of patients with CF are diagnosed 
by age 3. Genotyping for mutations in the CFTR gene is now routine practice in many countries, and 
90% of patients in the EU are genotyped. During the years, prognosis of CF has been improved which 
is partly due to early recognising and early intervention.  
In the 1950, many patients died before the age of 5, while currently many patients reach adulthood. 
The current life expectancy is > 30 years. The ageing of the CF population has brought a paradigm 
shift in outlook in the adult healthcare sector, from a focus on the care of lung disease to the 
management of a complex multi-system chronic illness, including the care for diabetes, renal function, 
osteoporosis, and hepatic function.  
There is a wide spectrum of severity in CF, even among patients who harbour the same mutations. 
Some patients are severely affected, with symptoms already present at birth (meconium ileus). Most 
patients develop symptoms during childhood, while some patients may only demonstrate mild or 
atypical symptoms in adulthood. Usually, patients with Type I-III mutations are more severely affected 
than those with ≥ type 4 mutations.  
2.1.5.  Management 
Data in the literature suggest that early therapeutic intervention is beneficial to young children with 
CF; studies have demonstrated benefits such as improved measures of growth, nutrition, and lung 
disease through early intervention in children diagnosed by newborn screening.

Most treatments available for the treatment of CF are symptomatic, but the CFTR modulators may 
improve CFTR function, which is believed to be the primary cause of disease. Current treatment 
guidelines recommend CFTR modulator and symptomatic medications concomitantly administered to 
maintain and improve lung function, reduce the risk of infections and exacerbations, and improve 
quality of life. 
Symkevi is a CFTR modulator, a product that affects the underlying defect in the CF transmembrane 
conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. CFTR modulators can be classified as potentiators and/or 
correctors. Symkevi is a fixed dose combination consisting of the CFTR corrector tezacaftor and the 
CFTR potentiator ivacaftor. Correctors improve intracellular processing of the CFTR protein, increasing 
surface expression, in class II mutations while potentiators recover the function of the CFTR protein at 
the apical surface of epithelial cells, to allow more chloride to flow through and reduce the symptoms 
of CF. However, there is an inter-dependence between channel gating and cellular processing given 
that each depends on CFTR protein folding, thus a sharp distinction between a potentiator and 
corrector might be somewhat artificial. 
Kalydeco (ivacaftor, IVA), Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor, LUM/IVA) are the only CFTR modulators 
approved for CF patients with specific mutations in children aged 6-11 years. Ivacaftor (in Kalydeco as 
mono-component and in Orkambi as part of a fixed dose combination) is a potentiator; the active 
substance lumacaftor is a corrector (present in the fixed dose combination Orkambi). Clinical efficacy 
of ivacaftor monotherapy has been established in Class III mutations that cause defects in channel 
gating as well as in the Class IV mutation R117H which also produces a gating defect. Clinical efficacy 
of the combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor has been established in patients homozygous for the 
F508del mutation in the CFTR gene. However, some patients are not able to tolerate treatment with 
LUM/IVA due to respiratory events related to off-target effects of the lumacaftor component. In 
addition, lumacaftor is a strong CYP3A inducer and some patients may not take it because of the 
potential to cause clinically relevant drug-drug interactions.  
Extension of the IVA in combination with TEZ/IVA indication to patients 6 through 11 years old would 
provide an alternative treatment option for patients homozygous for F508del (F/F). Currently, there 
are no CFTR modulators approved in children aged 6-11 heterozygous for F508del and CFTR mutations 
of residual function (F/RF). Symkevi would fulfil an unmet medical need for these patients. 
2.2.  About the product 
In the EU, Kalydeco is indicated in monotherapy for patients with certain pre-specified gating (class 
III) mutations as well as for those with the R117H-CFTR mutation. Kalydeco is also indicated in a 
combination regimen with tezacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 150 mg tablets for the treatment of adults and 
adolescents aged 12 years and older with cystic fibrosis (CF) who are homozygous for the F508del 
mutation or who are heterozygous for the F508del mutation and have one of the following mutations in 
the CFTR gene: P67L, R117C, L206W, R352Q, A455E, D579G, 711+3A→G, S945L, S977F, R1070W, 
D1152H, 2789+5G→A, 3272-26A→G, and 3849+10kbC→T. 
The scope for the current application is to apply for an extension of the above indication for children 
aged ≥ 6 years, i.e. Kalydeco tablets are also indicated in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ 
ivacaftor tablets for the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) aged 6 years and older with 
cystic fibrosis (CF) who are homozygous for the F508del mutation or who are heterozygous for the 
F508del mutation and have one of the following mutations in the CFTR gene: P67L, R117C, L206W, 
R352Q, A455E, D579G, 711+3A→G, S945L, S977F, R1070W, D1152H, 2789+5G→A, 3272-26A→G, 
and 3849+10kbC→T.

2.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The application consists of results from quality and clinical studies. The clinical programme for children 
aged 6 through 11 years is based on the partial extrapolation of efficacy from adults to children, 
supported by PK/safety study VX15-661-113 and pivotal phase 3 parallel group trial VX661-115 in 54 
patients aged 6-11 years. 
In clinical studies of patients ≥12 years old, TEZ/IVA demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements 
in lung function and improvements in pulmonary exacerbations, Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised 
(CFQ-R) respiratory domain (RD) score, and other important CF outcomes (EMEA/H/C/004682/0000 
and EMEA/H/C/002494/II/63).  
The key studies to support the efficacy and safety in adults and adolescents aged ≥ 12 years were 
study VX14-661-106 and study VX14-661-108. Study 106 and 108 were both randomised, double 
blind, placebo-controlled phase III trials. Study 106 was a parallel study conducted in patients 
homozygous for F508del of 24-week duration; study 108 was a crossover study conducted in patients 
heterozygous for F508del and an CFTR mutation of residual function of 8-week duration. Study VX14-
661-110 (open label extension) provided evidence of safety (primary endpoint) and efficacy outcomes 
beyond the duration of study 106 and study 108. 
The clinical development in patients 6 through 11 years of age was initiated in 2016. The initial aim of 
Study VX15-661-113 was to achieve at the selected doses of tezacaftor and ivacaftor similar systemic 
exposures to those of older patients as well as to assess the safety of the treatment in this age group. 
Efficacy was included as a secondary endpoint. Study VX16-661-115 was designed to provide a bridge 
on the efficacy and safety results from patients aged 6-11 years to patients aged ≥ 12 years.  
Children from both studies 113 and 115 were offered to roll over in an open-label extension (Study 
VX17-661-116 [Study 116]). Study 116 is ongoing and will support long-term safety and persistence 
of efficacy.

Given the similarities in the genetic, molecular and pathophysiological aetiology of CF across different 
age groups, the MAH considered that the principles of extrapolation could be applied in line with the 
principles described in the ICH E11 guideline, the EMA Reflection Paper on Paediatric Extrapolation and 
the FDA paediatric guidance. 
The initial paediatric investigational plan (PIP) was agreed in May 2015 and included Studies 113 and 
115.

Scientific advice 
The MAH sought CHMP scientific advice for Study 115 after the Phase 3 data in subjects ≥12 years old 
became available in 2017 (EMEA/H/SA/2814/3/2017/PED/II). Study 115 was designed to provide 
supportive efficacy data that could bridge to the efficacy data observed in adults. 
2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The finished product introduced within this line extension application is presented as film-coated 
tablets containing 75 mg of ivacaftor as active substance. This is to be added to the existing 150 mg 
film-coated tablets and 25 mg, 50mg and 75 mg granules. 
150 mg tablets 25, 50 and 75 mg granules 
Other ingredients are:  
Tablet core: hypromellose acetate succinate, microcrystalline cellulose, lactose monohydrate, 
croscarmellose sodium, sodium laurylsulfate (E487), colloidal anhydrous silica and magnesium stearate 
Tablet film coat: polyvinyl alcohol, titanium dioxide (E171), macrogol (PEG 3350), talc, indigo carmine 
aluminum lake (E132), carnauba wax 
Printing ink: shellac, iron oxide black (E172), propylene glycol (E1520), ammonium hydroxide  
The product is available in a thermoform (PolyChloroTriFluoroEthylene [PCTFE]/foil) blister. 
2.4.2.  Active Substance 
This is a line extension application where no new information on the active substance has been 
provided. 
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The new strength introduced with this line extension application is Kalydeco 75mg immediate-release 
film-coated tablets for oral administration. Specifically, this new tablet strength has been co- 
developed to be used as the evening dose for the combination treatment with fixed dose combination 
tablets of Symkevi (tezacaftor /ivacaftor) (50mg/75mg) in children from 6 through 11 years of age and 
body weight below 30 kg as part of a mismatched regimen. 
These tablets are 12.70 mm x 6.78 mm light blue capsule-shaped, printed with V 75 in black ink on 
one face and plain on the other. The acceptability and palatability of the paediatric tablet has been 
demonstrated in the paediatric population as part of the clinical studies. There were no reported 
product complaints attributed to difficulty swallowing tablets. Because the product was only 
administered as a tablet in these studies, there are no clinical data currently available to support other 
methods of administration besides swallowing whole; chewing or crushing the tablet is not 
recommended and a warning has been added in section 4.2 of the SmPC and section 5 of the package 
leaflet. 
Assessment report  
EMA/628136/2020  
Page 14/117 
 
 
 
 
The absence of studies on possible modification of the tablets is justified by the presence of alternative 
age appropriate formulations (Kalydeco granules), in line with the guideline on pharmaceutical 
development of medicines for paediatric use (EMA/CHMP/QWP/805880/2012 Rev. 2) and the approved 
PIP. 
As for the marketed Kalydeco 150 mg tablets and granules presentations, ivacaftor active substance is 
provided as an amorphous spray dried dispersion (SDD) intermediate.  
Opadry II (Blue) is an excipient used for non-functional film-coating of the core tablet.  
Opacode Black, is the ink used for printing the film-coated tablet. The printing ink components are listed 
in section 6.1. of the SmPC. 
The excipients used for the manufacture of Kalydeco 75 mg tablets are qualitatively the same as those 
used for Kalydeco 150 mg tablets. They are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is 
compliant with Ph. Eur standards, with the exception of: methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), which is a process 
solvent used for the manufacture of the SDD and is removed during processing, Opadry II (Blue) 
(coating excipient) and Opacode Black, (printing ink). Opadry II (Blue) and Opacode Black, consist of 
mixtures of excipients wherein their individual components meet appropriate Ph. Eur. or international 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in the introduction of the quality section of this report. 
The pharmaceutical development of this new tablet strength relies on the development of Kalydeco 150 
mg film-coated tablets and Kalydeco granules and is aligned with the approved PIP 001640-PIP01-14-
M05. 
The ivacaftor 75mg tablet uses the same core tablet blend formulation as that contained in the 
ivacaftor 150mg tablet and the tablet weight is adjusted to achieve the desired dose. The quantitative 
composition of the two strengths is dose proportional with the exception the concentration of blue 
pigment (FD&C Blue #2), which is used at a lower concentration to achieve a lighter blue colour for the 
tablet. This difference is accounted for by adjusting the level of titanium dioxide in the film coating 
composition. 
Due to its poor aqueous solubility the crystalline ivacaftor active substance is converted into an 
amorphous SDD intermediate for use in the tablet formulation as described above.  
The quality target product profile (QTPP) is provided in the table below. 
Quality Target Product Profile 
Critical quality attributes (CQAs) for ivacaftor SDD and ivacaftor 75 mg tablets and their impact on 
quality, safety, and/or efficacy of the product have been described. These include appearance, 
identification, assay, degradation products, dissolution, uniformity of dosage units, physical form, 
water content, microbial attributes, elemental impurities and residual solvents.   
Assessment report  
EMA/628136/2020  
Page 15/117 
 
 
 
  
Once the tablet CQAs were identified, initial risk assessments of the incoming materials and 
manufacturing process were performed.  The in-vitro dissolution method for quality control (QC) 
testing of ivacaftor 75 mg tablets was developed based on the approved method for Kalydeco 150 mg 
tablets and Kalydeco granules. It uses the same conditions as those used for the ivacaftor 150 mg 
tablets; the only difference is the surfactant level as less surfactant is required to achieve sink 
conditions. The same approach was employed for the ivacaftor 50 mg and 75 mg granules, resulting in 
better discriminatory power.   
The ivacaftor 75 mg dissolution method was shown to be able to discriminate against material 
attributes and tablet properties that could affect product performance, namely tablet hardness, SDD 
bulk density and presence of crystalline ivacaftor. The dissolution method is considered suitable for its 
intended use as the primary QC method for testing the dissolution performance of the ivacaftor 75 mg 
tablets during release and stability studies. 
The 75 mg tablets are manufactured using the same direct compression batch manufacturing process 
as the ivacaftor 150 mg tablets, comprising preparation of the SDD, blending of the active SDD with 
excipients, compression, film coating and printing.  
The manufacturing process development of ivacaftor 75 mg tablets followed a Quality by Design (QbD) 
approach. Risk assessment, prior knowledge and screening experiments were used to design 
multivariate experiments to evaluate main effects and interactions. Specifically, a design of 
experiments (DOE) was performed to evaluate the potential impact of incoming material attributes and 
compression process parameters on finished product CQAs and define a design space. These 
experiments considered the desired manufacturing ranges (DMR) as well as incoming material 
specifications and equipment capability. Any differences in scale or equipment between the 
experiments conducted and the commercial equipment have been considered (scale-up and 
engineering risk assessment) to ensure results are representative of the commercial process and are 
documented as appropriate. Four model confirmation runs were also conducted to confirm the accuracy 
of the resulting process models and to demonstrate process performance on commercial scale 
equipment.  
The compression unit operation was assessed as having a medium risk of impacting the tablet 
appearance. Appearance of the core tablet was not noticeably impacted across the entire evaluated 
experimental manufacturing range.  
A DOE was performed to evaluate the potential impact of the film coating process parameters on drug 
product CQAs. Four confirmation runs were also conducted on commercial scale equipment to confirm 
the accuracy of the process models as well as assess the impact of compressing tablets at both the 
high and low ends of the compression DMR on the CQAs of appearance and water content. 
All the DOE runs met the appearance specification.  
The impact of the film coating process parameters on the tablet water content CQA was assessed the 
highest observed coated tablet water content was below the specification of in the final coated tablet 
put in place to control both the physical form and microbial attributes of the ivacaftor 75mg tablets. 
The three lots of coated and waxed tablets from the film coating confirmation runs were utilized for the 
printing experiments. All the printed tablets met the appearance specification.  
After the criticality assessment, the design space was defined. A summary of the design space and IPC 
limits has been provided In-process controls (IPCs) are in place for core tablet weight, thickness and 
hardness during compression, tablet weight gain during the film coating and visual inspection at the 
end of the printing process. 
The formulation used during clinical studies is the same as that intended for marketing.

Bulk tablets are packaged in double low-density polyethylene bags inside a heat-sealed foil laminated 
bag.  The  finished  product  is  packaged  in  a  thermoform  blister  consisting  of  clear  Aclar  (PCTFE  – 
polychlorotrifluoroethylene) film laminated to PVC (polyvinyl chloride) film and sealed with a blister foil 
lidding.  The  Aclar/foil  blister  configuration  will  be  sealed  in  a  weekly  blister  card.  All  packaging 
components comply with Commission Regulation (EU) No 10/2011. The choice of the container closure 
system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of six main steps: manufacturing of ivacaftor SDD (which in turn 
comprised  mixture  preparation,  spray  drying  and  secondary  drying);  blending  of  the  SDD  with  tablet 
excipients  microcrystalline  cellulose,  lactose  monohydrate,  croscarmellose  sodium,  colloidal  silicon 
dioxide,  and  sodium  lauryl  sulfate;  blending  of  the  resulting  mixture  magnesium  stearate,  direct 
compression,  film-coating  and  printing.  The  process  is  considered  to  be  a  standard  manufacturing 
process. 
As described above, a design space has been proposed for compression and film-coating. The available 
development data, the proposed control strategy and batch analysis data from commercial scale batches 
fully support the proposed design space. 
The proposed hold time of 24 months for the bulk tablets has been justified with stability data from a 
bulk  batch  of  75  mg  tablets  stored  for  24  months  at  25  ºC  /  60%  RH  in  the  bulk  tablet  packaging 
configuration  and  supplemented  with  data  from  three  batches  of  150  mg  tablets  stored  in  the  bulk 
packaging configuration for 36 months. No significant change was observed. Since both tablet strengths 
are  manufactured  from  a  common  blend  and  have  the  same  bulk  packaging  configurations  this  is 
acceptable.  
It has also been confirmed that the product shelf life is calculated from the start of the finished product 
manufacturing  process  in  line  with  the  CHMP  Guideline  on  manufacture  of  the  finished  dosage  form 
(EMA/CHMP/QWP/245074/2015).

demonstrate that the tablet manufacturing process is capable of reproducible commercial manufacture. 
The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process. 
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form: 
appearance (visual), identification (IR, Ph.Eur.), assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), uniformity 
of dosage units (Ph.Eur.), dissolution (Ph.Eur.) and water content (KF). 
 The organic impurities in the ivacaftor 75mg tablet are the same as those in ivacaftor active substance 
and SDD (also used to manufacture the existing Kalydeco 150 mg tablets and Kalydeco granules) and 
ivacaftor 150 mg tablets. No additional degradants have been identified for the ivacaftor 75 mg tablets.  
No additional potential risk of nitrosamines formation has been identified; hence, it is agreed that it 
does not need to be resubmitted with this line extension. During development, physical form of tablets 
was monitored at both release and on stability by XRPD. No crystalline content was observed for any 
lot of uncoated or coated tablets at release, including testing of QbD study samples during process

development, clinical, and primary campaigns utilizing the process representative of commercial 
production. 
Since the 75 mg tablets have the same core tablet composition and coating components as the 150 mg 
tablets, and use a similar manufacturing process, the same justification of specification is applicable for 
the two strengths. 
The same water content specification  at release has been defined to ensure physical stability, as 
supported by crystallization and moisture uptake modelling indicating that tablets will remain 
physically stable for at least 48 months when stored in the intended container and closure system at 
the intended storage conditions. The defined release water specification limit will also assure a water 
activity below 0.60, which does not support microbial growth. The limit is also supported by 
development stability data. Additionally, crystallization and moisture uptake modelling for ivacaftor 75 
mg tablets provide justification that tablets containing water up to the acceptable limit at release will 
remain physically stable for at least 48 months when stored in the intended container and closure 
system at the intended storage conditions. 
All CQAs that can potentially be impacted by water content (physical form, microbial limits, and 
dissolution) will be tested on stability. Therefore, water content is measured only at release. 
Microbiological purity is not included in the release specification, this is acceptable since the proposed 
release water specification limit does not support microbial, as also supported by stability data. 
Although the data indicate that ivacaftor tablets possess very low risk of microbial contamination, the 
applicant will perform microbial limits testing on commercial stability lots to verify that the risk remains 
low. 
Physical form of the active substance (by XRPD) for the ivacaftor 75 mg tablets are not included in the 
release specification, as it is ensured by process and material controls: control of the incoming 
ivacaftor SDD, which has a specification of absence of crystalline ivacaftor; control of the 
manufacturing process and excipients (i.e. microcrystalline cellulose and croscarmellose sodium) to 
ensure tablet water content is at an acceptable level at release; confirmation that an acceptable level 
of tablet water content has been achieved by testing tablet water content at release. Additionally, 
during development, the physical form was monitored both at release and on stability. For any lot of 
uncoated or coated tablets used in the QbD study, process development, clinical, and primary 
campaigns, which have all being manufactured using a manufacturing process representative of 
commercial production, no crystalline content was observed at release. During development, physical 
form of tablets was monitored at both release and on stability by XRPD. No crystalline content was 
observed for any lot of uncoated or coated tablets at release, including testing of QbD study samples 
during process development, clinical, and primary campaigns utilising the process representative of 
commercial production. Given the existing controls of the incoming materials and the manufacturing 
process, the physical form of the tablet will be confirmed by XRPD during stability only. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in ivacaftor 75 mg tablets was assessed according to 
the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities using a risk-based approach. The risk assessment 
considered the potential contributions from the ivacaftor active substance and SDD (including solvents, 
reagents, excipients, and equipment), water, tablet excipients, and manufacturing equipment to 
determine the overall contribution of elemental impurities to the ivacaftor tablets. The elemental 
impurities intentionally added in the ivacaftor active substance manufacturing process are controlled 
according to ICH Q3D requirements. The risk assessment of the content of Class 1 and Class 2A 
elemental impurities (as defined in ICH Q3D) in the ivacaftor active substance and SDD demonstrated 
that the risk of elemental impurities in these materials is low. All tablet excipients were also shown to 
comply with ICH Q3D requirements in the tablet. Batch analysis data, using a validated ICP-MS 
method, of representative batches, including nine commercial batches of active substance, four 
Assessment report  
EMA/628136/2020  
Page 18/117 
 
 
 
commercial batches of SDD and three primary stability batches of 75 mg tablets confirmed that the 
contents of Class 1 and Class 2A elemental impurities are consistently below 30% of the ICH Q3D 
Option 1 limits.  
This risk assessment and confirmatory testing demonstrates that the risk of elemental impurities in the 
ivacaftor 75 mg tablets is low and the product will consistently meet the ICH Q3D requirements. 
Therefore, no additional controls on elemental impurities are required. The information on the control 
of elemental impurities is satisfactory. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for three pilot and four commercial scale batches confirming the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product 
specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data from three pilot scale batches of Kalydeco 75 mg tablets stored for up to 24 months under 
long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and intermediate conditions (30 ºC / 75% RH) and for up to 6 
months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
The batches of Kalydeco 75 mg are representative to those proposed for marketing and were packed in 
the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Additional supportive stability data from Kalydeco 150 mg tablets which are part of Kalydeco MA dossier 
and  have  an  approved  shelf-life  of  4  years  were  taken  into  consideration.  These  are  considered 
representative, since as discussed above, both tablet strengths are manufactured using the same blend, 
direct compression manufacturing process, film coating components, and container closure system.  
Samples were tested for appearance, assay, degradation products, dissolution, physical form (XRPD). 
Although not part of the proposed stability specification water content (KF) was also included in the initial 
stability program. In addition, microbial limits (TAMC, TYMC, E. coli) and water activity were tested the 
initial time point. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating.  
All results met the acceptance criteria for the attributes evaluated.  
No trends in the assay data were observed after storage for up to 18 months at 25°C/60% RH and 6 
months at 40°C/75% RH for the primary stability lots. A slight upward trend in assay was observed after 
storage for up to 18 months at 30°C/75% RH. However, all results obtained were well within specification 
limits and the small increase in assay values is within the expected analytical variability. 
For all stability studies, the X-ray powder diffraction data show absence of crystalline ivacaftor at all test 
points under all storage conditions. 
The water content data from the primary stability lots showed a modest increase in water content under 
the long-term and accelerated storage conditions with values above 4.0% at 18 months at 30°C/75% 
RH and 6 months at 40°C/75% RH. However, all parameters that can potentially be impacted by water 
content (physical form, microbial limits and dissolution) are tested on stability with no out of specification 
results. 
Assessment report  
EMA/628136/2020  
Page 19/117 
 
 
 
In accordance with EU GMP guidelines1, any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative 
trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and EMA. 
In addition, one pilot scale batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability 
Testing of New Drug Substances and Products ICH Q1B Option 2. Samples were tested for appearance, 
assay, and degradation products. The data, showing no changes in the fully exposed test sample and 
the covered control, confirms that Kalydeco 75 mg tablets do not require light protective packaging. 
The data from the primary stability lots of Kalydeco 75 mg tablets remain well within the commercial 
specification acceptance limits at 25°C/60% RH, 30°C/75% RH and 40°C/75% RH and are consistent 
with the stability results obtained for the weight multiple Kalydeco 150 mg tablets, and therefore, the 
proposed  shelf-life  of  4  years  when  stored  in  the  container  closure  system  and  no  special  storage 
condition as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
It has been confirmed that the product shelf-life is calculated in accordance with the CHMP NfG on the 
Start of shelf-life of the finished dosage form (CPMP/QWP/072/96). 
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as 
those used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the 
use of ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the 
Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal 
products. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of Kalydeco 75 mg film-coated tablets has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. As discussed above, most of the pharmaceutical development 
relevant for Kalydeco 75 mg film-coated tablets was performed for Kalydeco 150 mg film-coated 
tablets. Both tablet strengths are manufactured from the same blend and using the same 
manufacturing process.  
QbD principles were applied in the development of the tablets and their manufacturing process. A 
design space has been proposed for the compression and film-coating steps. This has been adequately 
verified. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product 
quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a 
satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on TSE safety.

Not applicable. 
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable. 
2.5.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Even though this submission encompasses a proposed extension of the indication for Kalydeco to support 
the combination regimen with Symkevi for fixed dose combination tablet in patients age 6 to 11 years 
old who have an indicated CFTR genotype, the addition of the 6-11 years patient age group is covered 
by 
the  prevalence  data  used 
for  Kalydeco  environmental 
risk  assessment 
(procedure 
EMEA/H/C/002494/IB/WS/1595). Therefore, there will be no increase in environmental risk to ivacaftor 
from the addition of the 6-11 years patient age group. 
2.5.2.  Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
The data submitted in the non-clinical part of the dossier are acceptable for this type of application. 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of ivacaftor. Considering the above data, ivacaftor is not expected to pose 
a risk to the environment. 
2.6.  Clinical aspects 
2.6.1.  Introduction 
In order to support this extension of indication application, the MAH submitted the clinical studies 
VX15-661-113 and Study VX16-661-115 to provide the bridge for the extrapolation of the efficacy and 
safety of patients ≥12 years to children aged 6 to less than 12 years old.  
•  Study VX15-661-113 (Study 113) is a 2-part open-label study designed to evaluate 
TEZ/IVA pharmacokinetics (PK) in Part A (Study 113A) and 24 week safety in Part B (Study

2.6.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Dose selection for the pivotal efficacy and safety study 115 in children aged 6 to less than 12 years 
was derived principally from Phase III study 113 Parts A and B (Part A evaluated PK, safety and 
tolerability for 14 days as a PK lead-in to Study 113B, which evaluated PK, efficacy, safety and 
tolerability for 24 weeks). Evaluation of PK was included as an additional objective in study 115. 
Population PK models for TEZ and IVA were used for evaluation of PK results obtained in both studies. 
The objective of the population PK analysis was to characterize TEZ and IVA exposures in subjects 6 
through 11 years of age for comparison with exposures from subjects 12 years and older. 
The test products, doses, and mode of administration in Study 113 Part A and Part B are presented in 
the table below. 
Table 1 Test Product, Dose, and Mode of Administration in Study 113 
In study 113A, in children weighing less than 25 kg, tezacaftor 50 mg was administered as a 50-mg 
tablet using 500 mg/g of a spray-dried dispersion while ivacaftor 75 mg was administered as a capsule 
containing ivacaftor 75 mg granules spray-dried dispersion. None of these correspond to the 
formulations to be marketed, i.e., the TEZ 50-mg/IVA 75-mg FDC and IVA 75-mg tablet. Children 
weighing ≥ 25 kg in Study 113A received the marketed IVA 150-mg tablet in combination with a 50-
mg tablet of TEZ not intended for marketing. All children in Study 113B were dosed with the marketed 
formulations of TEZ/IVA and IVA or with the to-be-marketed formulations (i.e., FDC TEZ 50 mg/IVA 75 
mg tablet and IVA 75 mg tablet) depending on body weight.   
The pharmacokinetic (PK) Set was defined as subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug and 
for whom the primary PK data were considered to be sufficient and interpretable. The initial target 
enrolment in Part A was 16 subjects but this number was amended and finally a total of 13 subjects 
were enrolled and integrated the PK dataset; 2 subjects weighed <25 kg at baseline and were enrolled 
in Cohort 1 and 11 subjects weighed ≥25 kg at baseline and were enrolled in Cohort 2. All subjects 
completed the 14-day treatment regimen in Part A. Tezacaftor PK data were available in the 13 
subjects in the PK dataset at Day 1 and in 12 subjects at Day 14. For ivacaftor, PK data were available 
for 10 subjects at Day 1 and for 12 subjects at day 14. Three subjects were receiving IVA 
monotherapy before receiving TEZ/IVA at the start of study 113, and for these subjects, IVA

concentration data from Day 1, Day 21, and the Safety Follow-up Visit were excluded from the data 
analysis. One subject had difficulties with venepuncture at Day 14; therefore, blood collections were 
not collected for TEZ and IVA PK analyses. 
In Part B, the planned enrolment was approximately 56 subjects but finally 70 subjects were enrolled 
and 69 integrated the PK dataset. Out of these, 62 subjects weighed less than 40 kg and were dosed 
with TEZ 50 mg qd/IVA 75 mg q12h and 7 subjects weighed ≥ 40 kg and received TEZ 100 mg qd/IVA 
150 mg q12h.  
Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using standard non-compartmental methods. PK 
parameters calculated in non-compartmental analysis included Cmax, tmax, Ctrough, t½, CLss/F, 
Vss/F, and AUCτ.  
In part A, PK blood samples were collected on Day 1 at 1, 2, 4, 5, and 24 hours (i.e., pre-dose on Day 
2) after the morning dose of study drugs, before the morning dose of study drug on Day 14 and at 1, 
2, 4, and 5 hours after the morning dose of study drugs on Day 14. A PK blood sample was also 
collected at 168 hours (i.e., Day 21) after the morning dose of study drugs on Day 14 and at the 
Safety Follow-up Visit.  
In part B, a single PK blood sample was collected within 60 minutes before dosing at the Week 4 and 
Week 8 visits. At the Week 16 visit, PK blood samples were collected before the morning dose and at 
1, 2, 4, and 5 hours after the morning dose. If study drug was not administered on the day of the visit 
(i.e., study drug interruption or permanent discontinuation of study drug), only 1 PK blood sample was 
collected.  
Geometric mean (CV%) PK parameters of TEZ, M1-TEZ, and M2-TEZ on Day 1 and Day 14 are listed in 
Table 2. On Day 14, the geometric mean Cmax TEZ was 6300 ng/mL in Cohort 1 (subjects <25 kg; 
n=2), and 5340 ng/mL in Cohort 2 (subjects ≥25 kg; n=10). The geometric mean AUCτ was 66500 
ng*h/mL in Cohort 1 and 71600 ng*h/mL in Cohort 2.

Table 3 Geometric Mean (CV%) PK Parameters of IVA, M1-IVA, and M6-IVA, Part A PK Set 
The adult popPK model was applied to Study 113A data and simulations were conducted with the 
assumption that clearance and volume of distribution would scale allometrically with body weight using 
fixed exponents. Paediatric subjects 6 through 11 years of age typically weigh between 15 and 50 kg, 
and popPK simulations were performed to compare exposures for subjects in this weight range to 
those observed in subjects ≥12 years old in Phase 3 TEZ/IVA studies.  
Across the weight range in 6- through 11-year-olds, simulated geometric mean ratios (Cmin, AUC, and 
Cmax) showed that subjects <25 kg receiving TEZ 100 mg qd/IVA 150 mg q12h would have higher 
exposures for parent TEZ compared to subjects ≥12 years old. The weight cut-off was increased from 
25 kg to 40 kg for Study 113B and Study 115 in order to  achieve exposures similar to subjects ≥12 
years old across all of the weight ranges, to maintain the same TEZ:IVA dose ratio in the adult and 
paediatric populations, and to avoid exposures of TEZ that would be higher than those achieved in the 
≥12-year-old population. Therefore, for Part B, the body weight cut-off for dosing was shifted from 25 
kg to 40 kg, because modelling and simulations predicted the potential for higher TEZ exposures in 
subjects receiving 100 mg qd dose of TEZ. 
In Part B, 70 subjects were enrolled and a total of 67 subjects (95.7%) completed TEZ/IVA treatment, 
i.e., 62 who weighed less than 40 kg and received TEZ 50 mg QD/IVA 75 mg BID and 8 who weighed 
≥ 40 kg and received TEZ 100 mg QD/IVA 150mg BID.

Simulations of TEZ/IVA and M1-TEZ exposures with 35-kg, 30-kg and 25-kg cut-off for 
weight-based dosing 
Weight cut-off-based dosing was used in studies 113B and 115 with a weight cut-off of 40 kg. Upon 
review of the exposure data from these studies, an integrated popPK analysis of data was performed. 
The results demonstrated that for subjects 6 through 11 years of age who weighed ≥40 kg and 
received TEZ 100 mg qd/IVA 150 mg q12h, the distribution of individual TEZ, M1-TEZ, and IVA 
exposures were similar to the observed range of subjects 12 years of age and older. For subjects 
6 through 11 years of age who weighed <40 kg and received TEZ 50 mg qd/IVA 75 mg q12h, TEZ 
parent and IVA parent exposures fell within the lower range of observed exposures of subjects 
12 years and older. M1-TEZ exposures were similar to those of subjects 12 years and older (Table 6).

group, 40-kg weight cut-off (popPK analyses P133, including paediatric PK data from Study 
113 and 115) 
Additional simulations were performed to determine whether a different weight cut-off would achieve 
TEZ parent and IVA parent PK exposures that were more similar to the exposures observed in subjects 
12 years and older. Upon request from CHMP, the MAH provided graphs and tables of the simulated 
(expected) exposure levels given the 40 kg, 35 kg, and 30 kg weight cut-offs based on a minimum of 
500 simulations per scenario and including only simulated data and the reference ranges. Predicted 
TEZ, M1-TEZ, and IVA exposures were therefore simulated for 1000 virtual subjects using the popPK 
model at the requested weight-based dosing cut-offs. Predicted AUC for TEZ, M1-TEZ and IVA are 
shown in Figure 3. Panels A and C show the results of the new simulations for 1000 virtual subjects 
and Panels B and D the simulations which were initially submitted based on post hoc PK parameters 
(empirical Bayes estimates) from individual subjects in Phase 3 studies whose PK were measured. In 
these graphs, red data points correspond to exposures for subjects who would receive the same dose 
under the proposed posology as they did in the study, whereas blue data points correspond to 
exposures for subjects who would receive a different dose under the proposed posology than they did 
in the study.

subjects who are 6- through 11-years of age. 
Results of the new simulations (Panels A and C) were consistent with the predicted exposures that 
were originally submitted (Panels B and D). Both approaches to exposure simulation demonstrate 
better matching of TEZ and IVA parent exposures with the 30-kg cut-off and therefore this weight cut-
off was selected for dosing recommendations.

Paediatric results stratified by dosing regimen are presented in Figures 4 and 5 for Cmax, and Cmin 
respectively based on the pop-PK model initially submitted. In these graphs, all exposures were 
simulated using post hoc PK parameters (empirical Bayes estimates) from individual subjects in Phase 
3 studies whose PK were measured given that in terms of AUCT it has been shown that no major 
differences exist in the simulations when empirical Bayes estimates or population parameters are used.

2.6.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Tezacaftor is presumed to partially overcome the folding defect in F508del-CFTR, facilitating its correct 
cellular processing and trafficking, allowing the protein to reach the cell surface, where it exhibits 
improved chloride channel function compared to uncorrected F508del-CFTR. The channel gating 
activity of F508del-CFTR delivered to the cell surface by tezacaftor can be potentiated by ivacaftor to 
further enhance chloride transport. In vitro, the combined effect of tezacaftor and ivacaftor is 
increased quantity and function of CFTR at the cell surface, resulting in increases in chloride transport, 
airway surface liquid height, and ciliary beat frequency. 
Primary pharmacodynamics 
Sweat chloride (SwCl) was assessed in patients aged 12 years and older in the Phase 2 studies, Study 
101 and 103, and in the Phase 3 studies, Study 106 (F/F) and Study 108 (F/RF), as a biomarker of CFTR 
activity.  
In  study  101,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  study,  TEZ  and  TEZ/IVA  at  multiple  dose 
levels in adult subjects with the F/F genotype and in adult and adolescent subjects with F/G551D were 
investigated. TEZ was evaluated as a monotherapy and as a combination therapy with IVA 150 mg or 
IVA 50 mg every 12 hours (q12h) to evaluate the contributions of TEZ and IVA and to evaluate dosing 
schedule.  Four  regimens  of  TEZ  monotherapy  and  8  regimens  of  TEZ/IVA  combination  therapy  were 
planned for evaluation in subjects homozygous for F508del. A single regimen (TEZ 100 mg qd/IVA 150 
mg q12h) was assessed in F/G551D subjects.  
In F/F patients, monotherapy with tezacaftor 100 mg qd and 150 mg qd resulted in a mean treatment 
difference vs. placebo in the absolute change from baseline through day 28 in SwCl vs. placebo of -
19.6 and -9.6 mmol/l respectively. The mean treatment difference of the combination of tezacaftor 100 
mg qd and ivacaftor 150 mg q12h was -5.2 mmol/l. In F/G551D subjects, the mean treatment 
difference vs. placebo was -17.2 mmol/l.  
The inferior effect of TEZ/IVA compared with TEZ on SwCl in the phase 2 study 101 is not fully 
understood. There appears to be no sufficient reasons to exclude the possibility that TEZ as 
monotherapy may have clinically relevant pharmacodynamic activity, particularly when there are also 
discrepancies within the in vitro data and there is evident complexity in the mechanisms involved in 
correcting the CFTR function. The results of exposure-response modelling, submitted at the time of 
initial MAA to support clinical superiority of TEZ/IVA over TEZ are limited, since the model appears to 
be more accurate for FEV1 than for SwCl, but there are limitations for interpretation because of the 
very wide confidence intervals around the predicted responses. 
In  the  pivotal  study  106  (F/F),  the  LS  mean  treatment  difference  between  the  TEZ/IVA  and  placebo 
groups for the absolute change from baseline in SwCl was -9.1 mmol/L (95% CI: -10.7, -7.5) at week 
4. Through Week 24, the LS mean treatment difference was -10.1 mmol/L (95% CI: -11.4, -8.8). Within 
group, the LS mean change in SwCl from baseline through Week 24 was -9.9 mmol/L in the TEZ/IVA 
group and 0.2 mmol/L in the placebo group. 
In study 108 (F/RF), the LS mean treatment difference versus placebo for the absolute change in SwCl 
from study baseline to the average of Week 4 and Week 8 was -9.5 mmol/L (95% CI: -11.7, -7.3) for 
TEZ/IVA  and  -4.5  mmol/L  (95%  CI:  -6.7,  -2.3)  for  IVA.  The  reduction  in  SwCl  levels  was  greater  in 
TEZ/IVA group than in the IVA group. The LS mean treatment difference for the absolute change in SwCl 
from study baseline to the average of Week 4 and Week 8 was -5.1 mmol/L in favour of TEZ/IVA (95% 
CI: -7.0, -3.1; P<0.0001) 
Sweat chloride responses were also determined in study 113B and study 115 in children ages 6 to less 
than 12 years. In study 115, the LS mean absolute change from baseline in SwCl at Week 8 was -12.3

mmol/L (95% CI: -15.3, -9.3) in the TEZ/IVA group. In study 113B, the LS mean absolute change 
from baseline through Week 24 was -14.5 mmol/l (95% CI: -17.4, -11.6).  
Given the shift proposed in the body weight cut-off for dosing recommendations in children aged 6 to 
less than 12 years, the MAH was requested to discuss and demonstrate that the predicted increased 
exposure in children weighing ≥30 to less than 40 kg will likely result in improved efficacy outcomes 
than those observed in study 115 while efficacy is not negatively affected in children weighing less 
than 30 kg of body weight as the predicted systemic exposure is at the lower end of that of older 
patients. To that end PK/PD analyses of sweat chloride were provided. To evaluate the impact of 
increased TEZ exposures on efficacy, the sweat chloride PK/PD relationship in subjects 6 through 11 
years of age was compared to that in subjects ≥12 years of age (Figure 6 and 7).

The observed sweat chloride response in subjects 6 through 11 years of age overlaps with the 
response observed in subjects ≥12 years of age and was reasonably predicted by the relationship in 
subjects ≥12 years of age. In regions where the exposures overlap between these 2 age groups, the 
PK/PD responses are similar with respect to shape, magnitude, and variability.  
Sweat chloride PK/PD responses in subjects 6 through 11 years of age weighing <30 kg are shown in

Age 
Decreases in sweat chloride observed in subjects <30 kg were similar to the overall decrease observed 
in the TEZ/IVA group of study 115 and similar to that of subjects ≥12 years of age. TEZ/IVA-treated 
subjects who weighed <30 kg had a mean (SD) decrease in sweat chloride of -12.8 (10.6) mmol/L at 
Week 8, similar to the overall TEZ/IVA treatment group (mean [SD] change in sweat chloride at Week 
8: -12.5 [10.3] mmol/L). This improvement was also similar in magnitude to the within-group -9.9 
mmol/L decrease in sweat chloride observed in subjects ≥12 years of age in Study 106. 
Secondary pharmacodynamics 
The potential QTc prolongation of tezacaftor has been evaluated in a dedicated study in 116 healthy 
volunteers. It was concluded that tezacaftor at supratherapeutic dose did not prolong the QTcF interval 
in healthy subjects. The conduct of a dedicated QTc study with only TEZ is considered justified because 
tezacaftor has only a modest effect on the exposure of IVA. Since IVA has been shown not to prolong 
the QTc interval at supratherapeutic doses of 450 mg q12h, the increased IVA exposure in combination 
with TEZ is not considered relevant with respect to the probability to influence the QTc. 
2.6.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The main goal of the clinical pharmacology programme was to select a dosing regimen that would 
achieve TEZ and IVA parental exposures in children 6 through 11 years of age that were comparable to 
those shown to be safe and efficacious in the pivotal studies of subjects ≥12 years old with F/F and 
F/RF genotype.

This line extension proposes an additional lower strength tablet of Kalydeco (75 mg) to be 
administered in combination with Symkevi (TEZ/IVA) at a dose of 50 mg qd/75 mg q 12h for children 
weighing less than 30 kg or at 100 mg qd/150 mg q12 h for children weighing ≥ 30 kg. The lack of 
demonstration of bioequivalence between the new strength of 75 mg vs. the marketed 150-mg tablet 
of Kalydeco is considered acceptable based on the general requirements described in section 4.1.6 of 
the Guideline on Investigation of Bioequivalence, i.e., same manufacturing process, linear 
pharmacokinetics over the therapeutic range, same qualitative composition, same ratio between active 
substance and excipients, and similar dissolution profile under identical conditions between both 
strengths. 
To support the extension of the indication for ivacaftor in combination with TEZ/IVA to patients 6 
through 11 years of age, studies 113 and 115 were conducted. Study 113 was a phase 3, 2-part, 
open-label study in CF subjects 6 through 11 years of age, homozygous or heterozygous for F508del. 
Study 113 Part A (Study 113A) evaluated the PK, safety, and tolerability of TEZ/IVA administered for 
14 days. Safety, tolerability, and available PK data from Part A were reviewed to determine the doses 
and the weight cut-offs to be evaluated in Study 113 Part B (Study 113B) and Study 115. Study 113B 
evaluated the safety, tolerability, and PK of TEZ/IVA administered for 24 weeks; assessments related 
to efficacy were also evaluated. Study 115 was a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group study in CF 
subjects 6 through 11 years of age, homozygous or heterozygous for F508del. Study 115 evaluated 
the efficacy and safety of TEZ/IVA administered for approximately 8 weeks; assessment of TEZ/IVA 
pharmacokinetics was also evaluated.  
In study 113, tezacaftor and its metabolites as well as IVA and its metabolites in plasma were assayed 
according to previously reported analytical methods.  
In study 113A, in children weighing less than 25 kg, tezacaftor 50 mg was administered as a 50-mg 
tablet using 500 mg/g of a spray-dried dispersion while ivacaftor 75 mg was administered as a capsule 
containing ivacaftor 75 mg granules spray-dried dispersion. None of these correspond to the 
formulations to be marketed, i.e., the TEZ 50-mg/IVA 75-mg FDC and IVA 75-mg tablet. However, the 
granule formulation of ivacaftor was tested in bioavailability and food effect study (study 770-015) and 
considered comparable to the film-coated tablet formulation under fed conditions. Children weighing ≥ 
25 kg in Study 113A were dosed with the marketed formulation of IVA 150 mg and with a TEZ 50-mg 
monotherapy tablet not intended for marketing. All children in Study 113B were dosed with the 
marketed formulations of TEZ 100mg/IVA 150 mg and IVA 150 mg or with the to-be-marketed 
formulations (i.e., FDC TEZ 50 mg/IVA 75 mg and IVA 75 mg tablet) depending on body weight.  
Upon completion of Study 113A (N = 13), popPK simulations were performed using the allometric fixed 
exponents to compare exposures for subjects in the weight range from 15 to 50 kg to those observed 
in subjects ≥12 years old in the pivotal Phase 3 TEZ/IVA studies 106, 107, and 108. Across the weight 
range in 6- through 11-year-olds, simulated geometric mean ratios (Cmin, AUC, and Cmax) showed 
that subjects <25 kg receiving TEZ 100 mg qd/IVA 150 mg q12h would have higher exposures for 
parent TEZ compared to subjects ≥12 years old. The weight cut-off was thus increased from 25 kg to 
40 kg for Study 113B and Study 115 in order to achieve exposures similar to subjects ≥12 years old 
across all of the weight ranges, to maintain the same TEZ:IVA dose ratio in the adult and paediatric 
populations, and to avoid exposures of TEZ that would be higher than those achieved in the ≥12-year-
old population. 
Upon review of the exposure data from these studies, an integrated popPK analysis of data was 
performed. The results from this integrated popPK analysis demonstrated that for subjects 6 through 
11 years of age who weighed ≥40 kg and received TEZ 100 mg qd/IVA 150 mg q12h, the distribution 
of individual TEZ, M1-TEZ, and IVA exposures were similar to the observed range of subjects 12 years 
of age and older. For subjects 6 through 11 years of age who weighed <40 kg and received TEZ 50 mg 
Assessment report  
EMA/628136/2020 
Page 42/117 
 
 
  
qd/IVA 75 mg q12h, TEZ parent and IVA parent exposures fell within the lower range of observed 
exposures of subjects 12 years and older. M1-TEZ exposures were similar to those of subjects 12 years 
and older.  
Additional simulations were performed to optimise the final proposed dosing regimen. The objective of 
these popPK simulations was to determine whether a different weight cut-off would achieve TEZ parent 
and IVA parent PK exposures that were more similar to the exposures observed in subjects 12 years 
and older. For this purpose, weight cut-offs of 40 kg, 35 kg, 30 kg and 25 kg were applied. 
Approximately one third of subjects in Studies 113 and 115 weighed ≥30 kg and <40 kg. The body 
weight cut-off of 30 kg was proposed by the MAH on the basis that in the simulations presented the 
majority of TEZ and IVA PK exposures were predicted to fall within the adult reference range (5th to 
95th percentiles) and the median exposures will be more similar to the median adult exposure.   
While it was acknowledged that the 30 kg cut-off resulted in the most comparable exposures for IVA, 
M1-TEZ and TEZ in children as compared to adolescents and adults as opposed to the other 
investigated weight cut-offs, for subjects 6 through 11 years of age who weighed <30 kg who will 
receive TEZ 50 mg qd/IVA 75 mg q12h, TEZ parent and IVA parent exposures still fell within the lower 
range of observed exposures of subjects 12 years and older. On the other hand, more than 50% of 
paediatric patients weighing at least 30 kg were predicted to show M1-TEZ exposures higher than the 
upper limit of the established range in adults. As a consequence, the MAH was requested to perform 
further model-based PK and PK-PD simulations to show that the proposed posology based on a body 
weight cut-off of 30 kg did not negatively impact efficacy in children weighing less than 30 kg of body 
weight and resulted in better efficacy outcomes (than those observed in study 115) in children 
weighing ≥30 to less than 40 kg. Model-based simulations for 1000 virtual subjects were performed to 
predicted TEZ, M1-TEZ, and IVA exposures using the weight-based dosing cut-offs of 40 kg, 35 kg, and 
30 kg. Based on these simulations, it was confirmed that only M1-TEZ AUC was affected by the body 
weight cut-off at 100 mg TEZ qd, showing significant differences in the proportion of patients within 
the exposure of adults: ~75% (40 kg cut-off), ~50% (35 kg cut-off), and <50% (30 kg cut-off). No 
significant differences in M1-TEZ AUC were observed when 50 mg TEZ qd was considered, neither in 
TEZ and IVA AUC for both dose levels across the different body weight cut-offs. In addition, the MAH 
explored through a PK/PD relationship the impact in terms of sweat chloride of selecting 30 kg vs 40 
kg cut-off in paediatric patients with body weights between 30 and 40 kg as compared to that in 
patients aged 12 years and older. The plots of the PK/PD relationship do not show a significant change 
in terms of sweat chloride response when 30 or 40 kg cut-off was selected, which indicates that similar 
response rate will be achieved irrespective of the TEZ and IVA exposures compared to patients ≥12 
years of age. A slight decrease (improvement) in sweat chloride (0.8 mmol/l) is predicted in patients 
weighing 30 to <40 kg when receiving an increased dose compared to the actually received dose in 
study 115, due to the 30 kg cut-off. In children weighing less than 30 kg, the PK-PD data provided 
indicate that the sweat chloride reduction at the lower dose in children <30 kg, despite the somewhat 
lower exposures to TEZ and IVA, is within the range of sweat chloride effects in patients ≥12 years of 
age, even though this could have been better addressed by comparing the predicted exposure-
response in these children versus those weighing more than 30 kg.  
The ratio M1-TEZ/TEZ appears different for patients aged 6 through 11 years (with ratios of 2.1 and 
1.8 in patients <30 and ≥30 kg, respectively) and adolescents (ratio of 1.56) and adults (ratio 1.47). 
This appears to indicate that relatively more M1-TEZ is formed in children aged 6 through 11 years.  
The MAH was requested to discuss the involvement of TEZ and M1-TEZ in efficacy and safety. The 
actual cause for the increased formation of M1-TEZ remains unclear, but the relationship between the 
increased exposure of TEZ + M1-TEZ versus TEZ among the efficacy and safety endpoints have been 
explored by the MAH. In terms of sweat chloride, the increased exposure does not translate into 
greater response, since the maximum effect is practically reached in Q1 of exposure of TEZ and 
Assessment report

TEZ+M1-TEZ. In terms of safety, the additional data provided by the MAH such as (e.g.) the analysis 
of transaminase elevations by M1-TEZ levels in subjects ≥12 years of age and children 6 through 11 
years of age is reassuring albeit based on a limited number of patients.  
No update was provided on pharmacodynamics which is acceptable as the mechanism of action of 
tezacaftor and ivacaftor is not age dependent. The reduction in sweat chloride observed in study 113B 
and study 115 is within the range of that observed in older patients. The PK/PD relationships provided 
show similar response within the range of predicted TEZ and IVA AUC exposures with the proposed 
dosing regimen based on a cut-off body weight of 30 kg. 
Overall, considering the above-mentioned PK/PD relationship for sweat chloride and taking into 
account that similar M1-TEZ exposures have been observed in older patients with no indication of 
increased adverse event rates, the proposed body-weight cut-off of 30 kg is supported.   
The CHMP recommended the MAH to submit a new application to register the ivacaftor 75 mg granules 
formulation for the use in combination with Symkevi in order to provide paediatric patients who are not 
able to swallow tablets with an appropriate formulation. However, the MAH did not agree with this 
recommendation. It is therefore not expected that the MAH will submit a new application for the 75 mg 
granules formulation to allow its use in combination with Symkevi for patients not able to swallow 
tablets.  
2.6.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The proposed posology for children aged 6 to less than 12 years which is based on a cut-off body 
weight of 30 kg is agreeable even though the regimen TEZ 100mg qd/IVA 150 mg q12h has not been 
investigated in studies 113B or 115 in children weighing ≥ 30 kg to less than 40 kg. This is reflected in 
section 5.2 of the SmPC of Kalydeco tablets where it is stated that exposures in children aged 6 to less 
than 12 years old weighing ≥ 30 kg to less than 40 kg are predictions derived from the population PK 
model.     
he CHMP recommended the MAH to submit an application for the 75 mg granules formulation to allow 
its use in combination with Symkevi for patients not able to swallow tablets. This was not agreed by 
the MAH.  
2.7.  Clinical efficacy 
2.7.1.  Dose response study 
The proposed posology for children aged 6 to less than 12 years is based on the principle of exposure 
matching between this population and a reference population (adults/adolescents). A model-based 
analysis of the systemic exposure of TEZ, IVA, and M1-TEZ led the MAH to shift the body weight cut-
off from 40 kg to 30 kg (please refer to Section 3.2.6. Discussion on clinical pharmacology).  
2.7.2.  Main study 
The main study to support the application is Study VX16-661-115 (study 115): A Phase III, Double-
blind, Parallel-group Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Tezacaftor in Combination With 
Ivacaftor in Patients Aged 6 Through 11 Years With Cystic Fibrosis, Homozygous or heterozygous for 
the F508del-CFTR Mutation.

Methods 
Study design 
After the screening period of 4 weeks, patients were stratified by genotype before randomization so 
that F/F and F/RF patients would be randomized in a 4:1 ratio to either the TEZ/IVA group or the 
appropriate blinding group for their genotype. The F/F blinding group received placebo and the F/RF 
blinding group received IVA monotherapy. The placebo and IVA blinding groups’ treatment regimens 
were visually matched to the TEZ/IVA treatment regimen to maintain the blind.  
Subjects who were taking commercially available CFTR modulators (Orkambi or Kalydeco) were 
required to washout for 28 days before the Day 1 Visit. Study drug dose was determined based on 
weight on Day 1 (<40 kg or ≥40 kg). 
After completing the Week 8 Visit, patients were offered the opportunity to enrol in a 96-week open-
label TEZ/IVA extension study (Study VX17-661-116). The Safety Follow-up Visit was not required for 
patients who enrolled in the extension study within 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug in Study 
115.  
Patients who prematurely discontinued study drug treatment were asked to remain in the study and 
complete the efficacy assessments (LCI, CFQ-R, sweat chloride, spirometry, height, weight, BMI, and 
Drug Acceptability Questionnaire) from the time of discontinuation through the end of the Treatment 
Period.

Study Participants  
Patients were children aged 6 to 11 years (inclusive) with a confirmed diagnosis of CF. Patients were 
homozygous for F508del-CFTR or heterozygous for F508del. Heterozygous patients must have a 
second eligible mutation within the ones listed in Table 9. Genotyping was performed using a validated 
CF genotyping test and the diagnosis of CF confirmed if sweat chloride value was ≥60 mmol/l.

Heterozygous patients with sweat chloride less than 60 mmol/L could be enrolled if they had 
documented evidence of chronic sinopulmonary disease and/or gastrointestinal disease consistent with 
a diagnosis of CF.

The boxed alleles are included in the labelling of Kalydeco in combination with Symkevi.  
Enrolment was limited to patients with LCI2.5 result ≥7.5 at the Screening Visit, a body weight ≥ 15 kg, 
percent predicted FEV1 ≥70 percentage points and the ability to swallow the tablets. Patients with a 
history of any illness or condition that could confound study results or pose an additional safety risk 
(e.g., cirrhosis with portal hypertension, risk factors for Torsades de Pointes) were excluded from 
Study 115. Patients with protocol-defined laboratory values indicative of clinically significant abnormal 
liver or renal function were also excluded (either (a) any two or more of ≥ 3 x ULN for AST, ALT, GGT, 
ALP, or total bilirubin ≥2 x ULN; (b) ≥ 5 x ULN ALT or AST; (c) GFR ≤45 mL/min/1.73 m2 calculated by 
the Counahan-Barratt equation; or (d) hemoglobin <10 g/dL). 
Treatments 
The treatments applied in this study was the study drug tezacaftor/ivacaftor. The comparators were 
placebo (F508del/F508del, F/F) or ivacaftor (F508/CFTR mutation of residual function, F/RF).

It was recommended that patients remain on a stable CF medication regimen from 4 weeks before 
Day 1 through Week 8 or, if applicable, through the Safety Follow-up Visit. Information about 
bronchodilator use was collected and documented. Patients who used a bronchodilator had their 
spirometry assessments performed according to the guidelines specified in the protocol. 
Other concomitant medications were prohibited if there was potential for untoward drug-drug 
interactions, such as CYP3A4 inducers and CYP3A4 inhibitors.  
During the Screening Period, patients who were being treated with Orkambi or Kalydeco underwent a 
28-day washout before the Day 1 Visit. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to evaluate efficacy of TEZ/IVA in patients aged 6 through 11 years with CF, 
homozygous or heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation.  
Secondary objectives were to evaluate the safety of TEZ/IVA in patients aged 6 through 11 years with 
CF, homozygous or heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint: absolute change in lung clearance index 2.5 (LCI2.5) from baseline through 
Week 8 in F/F and F/FR patients randomised to TEZ/IVA. 
LCI2.5 is the number of lung turnovers required to reduce the end tidal inert gas concentration to 2.5% 
of its starting value). The LCI assessment device used in Study 115 was the Exhalyzer D (Ecomedics, 
Duernten, Switzerland). Central review of LCI2.5 measurements was conducted.  
Secondary efficacy endpoints: 
•  Absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride at Week 8 
•  Absolute change in Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) respiratory domain score 
from baseline through Week 8 
•  Safety and tolerability as measured by adverse events (AEs) 
•  Clinically significant changes in laboratory values (serum chemistry, haematology, coagulation 
studies, lipids, vitamin levels, and urinalysis), standard 12-lead ECGs, vital signs, pulse 
oximetry, serial lung function measurement, and ophthalmologic examinations (OEs). 
Additional endpoints 
•  Absolute change in LCI5.0 (number of lung turnovers required to reduce the end tidal inert gas 
concentration to 5.0% of its starting value) from baseline through Week 8 
•  Absolute change in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (ppFEV1) from 
baseline through Week 8 
•  Absolute change from baseline in body mass index (BMI), weight, and height and associated z-
scores at Week 8 
•  Drug acceptability assessment at Week 2 
•

Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Patients were stratified by genotype before randomization so that F/F and F/RF patients would be 
randomized in a 4:1 ratio to either the TEZ/IVA group or the appropriate blinding group for their 
genotype. The F/F blinding group received placebo and the F/RF blinding group received IVA 
monotherapy. The placebo and IVA blinding groups’ treatment regimens were visually matched to the 
TEZ/IVA treatment regimen to maintain the blind. 
The main purpose of these two groups (i.e. placebo and IVA monotherapy) is to preserve blinding, so 
that subjects and investigators do not assume a subject is receiving TEZ/IVA, which could introduce 
bias into the results. Descriptive statistics such as mean and SD were provided for change from 
baseline in LCI2.5 at each post-baseline visit for homozygous subjects in the placebo group.

The study planned to enrol approximately 65 subjects, of which up to 15 subjects should be 
heterozygous for RF.  
The sample size of this study is driven by demonstrating that the treatment effect of TEZ/IVA is based 
on a within-group comparison (change from baseline in LCI2.5 in subjects on TEZ/IVA) to exclude a 
maximum possible placebo effect. The size of the placebo effect was based on study VX14-809-109 
(study 109) in which treatment with LUM/IVA in homozygous F508del subjects aged 6 through 11 
years was assessed using the between-group difference in absolute change from baseline through 
week 24 in LCI2.5 as the primary efficacy endpoint. In Study 109, the placebo group had a mean 
worsening in LCI2.5 of 0.08 units with an SD of 1.41; the one-sided 90% lower bound was -0.10 and is 
used as an estimate for the pre-defined maximum possible placebo effect for Study 115.  
Accounting for a 10% dropout rate, approximately 40 subjects on TEZ/IVA will provide at least 90% 
power to exclude -0.10.  
Per the protocol and SAP, 40 subjects with the F/F genotype were specified receive TEZ/IVA to provide 
at least 90% power to exclude the predefined placebo effect. Power calculations were not performed 
for subjects with the F/RF genotype because this genotype is rarer compared to the F/F genotype; 
therefore, less historical data were available for this population to help ascertain how many of these 
subjects should be enrolled in Study 115. Per the protocol and SAP, 9 subjects with the F/RF genotype 
were specified to receive TEZ/IVA.  
Data sets 
The following analysis sets were defined:  
• All Subjects Set was defined as all patients who were randomised or dosed (i.e., all patients in the 
study). All patient data listings were referenced using the All Subjects Set, unless otherwise specified.  
• Full Analysis Set (FAS) included all randomised patients who were exposed to at least 1 dose of study 
drug and had an eligible genotype. The treatment assignment for the FAS was as randomised.  
• Safety Set included all patients who were exposed to at least 1 dose of study drug. The treatment 
assignment for the Safety Set was as treated.

Efficacy analyses were based on the Full Analysis Set (which included all patients randomized and 
dosed who had an eligible CFTR genotype) and performed as specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan. 
There was no adjustment for multiplicity; P values for secondary and additional endpoints are 
considered nominal.  
Efficacy analyses were based on within-group changes in the TEZ/IVA treatment group (F/F and F/RF 
genotypes combined). No hypothesis testing was performed for the placebo or IVA blinding groups. For 
the placebo group, only summary statistics were presented. For the IVA group, efficacy data were 
presented in listings only. 
Primary Endpoint- LCI2.5 
The primary endpoint was absolute within-group change from baseline in LCI2.5 through Week 8. For 
LCI2.5, a decrease in value reflects lung function improvement.  
The objective of the primary efficacy endpoint analysis was to demonstrate that the upper bound of the 
95% CI of the mean change from baseline in LCI2.5 through Week 8 in the TEZ/IVA group excluded a 
pre-defined maximum possible placebo effect. Based on the results of a previous study of LCI2.5 in 
placebo-treated paediatric (6- through 11-year-old) patients with CF homozygous for F508del (Study 
VX14-809-109), -0.10 was used as an estimate of the pre-defined maximum possible placebo effect on 
LCI2.5. 
The primary analysis was performed using a restricted maximum likelihood (REML)-based mixed-effect 
model for repeated measures (MMRM) for the patients in the TEZ/IVA treatment group. The model 
included absolute change from baseline in LCI2.5 (including all measurements up to Week 8 [inclusive]) 
as the dependent variable, and visit (as a class variable) as a fixed effect, with adjustment for CFTR 
genotype (F/F and F/RF) and baseline LCI2.5 (continuous) value as covariates, and patient as a random 
effect. An unconstructed covariance structure was used to model the within-patient errors.  
The primary result obtained from the model was the estimated average treatment effect on LCI2.5 
through Week 8 for patients in the TEZ/IVA group. The corresponding within-group LS mean (SE), 
95% CI, and P value were provided. If the upper bound of the 95% CI fell below the pre-defined 
maximum possible placebo effect (-0.10), the study would be considered to have achieved its primary 
objective. 
Sweat Chloride (secondary endpoint) 
A similar MMRM model was used to analyse sweat chloride data as described for the analysis of the 
primary efficacy variable, with the addition of baseline sweat chloride as a covariate. The assessment 
of efficacy was primarily based on the estimated within-group mean change from baseline at Week 8 in 
the TEZ/IVA group. 
CFQ-R Respiratory Domain Score (secondary endpoint) 
A similar MMRM model was used to analyse CFQ-R respiratory domain score, based on the Child 
Version of the questionnaire. Data were analysed using the same approach as described for the 
analysis of the primary efficacy variable, with the addition of baseline CFQ-R respiratory score as a 
covariate. The assessment of efficacy was primarily based on the estimated within-group mean change 
from baseline through Week 8. 
Other endpoints 
A similar MMRM model will be used for the FEV1 analysis of the primary efficacy variable, with the 
addition of corresponding baseline values (continuous) as covariates as appropriate.

Other endpoints were the LCI5.0, body mass index (BMI), BMI-for age- z-score for age, weight, weight-
for-age-z-score, height, height for age score, drug acceptability, faecal elastase-1 and immunoreactive 
trypsinogen, and pharmacokinetic endpoints like TEZ, M1-TEZ, IVA, M1-IVA. For these endpoints, only 
summary tables were to be provided. 
Placebo group 
The main purpose of the placebo group was to preserve blinding. Therefore, only summary statistics 
such as mean and SD were provided for change from baseline in LCI2.5 at each post-baseline visit for 
homozygous subjects in the placebo group. 
Safety analyses 
All safety analyses were based on the Safety Set (which included all subjects who received at least 1 
dose of study drug). Only descriptive summaries were presented, and no hypothesis testing was 
performed. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Twenty-three screened subjects were not enrolled. The main reasons for screening failure was LCI2.5 < 
7.5 (n=11), having ppFEV1 <70 percentage points at screening (n=6), having a recent acute illness 
(n=2), other reasons (n=2), having laboratory abnormalities deemed exclusionary (n=1), and not 
being able to swallow tablets (n=1).  
A total of 69 patients were randomized and 67 patients received at least 1 dose of study drug (54 
patients in the TEZ/IVA group; 10 patients in the placebo group; 3 patients in the IVA group). A total 
of 52 F/F subjects received at least 1 dose of study drug (42 subjects in the TEZ/IVA group and 10 
subjects in the placebo group). Fifteen F/RF subjects received at least 1 dose of study drug (12 
subjects in the TEZ/IVA group and 3 in the IVA group).  
Two subjects were randomized but not dosed in Study 115 for the following reasons, i.e., in the 
placebo group, 1 subject had an acute upper and lower respiratory infection on the planned first day of 
dosing and in the TEZ/IV group, 1 subject had an AE of lower respiratory tract infection subjects on the 
day of randomization. Both subjects met Exclusion Criterion 4 and were no longer eligible to participate 
in the study.  
Of the 67 patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug, 66 (98.5%) completed study drug 
treatment. One patient in the TEZ/IVA group prematurely discontinued treatment, because the 
patient’s screening LCI2.5 did not meet the eligibility criteria.

Table 10 Subject Disposition, All Subjects Set 
The FAS included all subjects who were randomized, received at least 1 dose of study drug, and had an 
eligible CFTR genotype. The Safety Set included all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study 
drug. In this study the FAS and the Safety Set were the same and included 67 subjects. 
Recruitment 
Study 115 has been conducted in 25 sites in Europe (UK, BE, DK, FR, DE, IE, PL, SW) and Australia. A 
total of n=53 (79.1%) were recruited in Europe and n=14 (21% in Australia). The study was initiated 
on 17 May 2018 and completed on 21 December 2018. 
Conduct of the study 
The final study protocol is dated 17 November 2017. The clinical study protocol included one country-
specific amendment to specify the volume of blood to be drawn at each study visit (Poland).  
Safety and tolerability data were reviewed by an independent data monitoring committee (IDMC). 
The statistical analyses plan (SAP) version 1.0 is dated 31 October 2018. The SAP has not been 
amended during the trial. However, the SAP was only finalised during the conduct of the trial raising 
concerns on how the blinding of the dataset had been maintained. It has been clarified that the clinical 
database was outsourced and, as such, the MAH had no access to the database. There were no 
unplanned unblinding events and all patients were randomised before the end date of the finalisation 
of the SAP. In addition, the SAP was finalised before the database lock (01 Feb 2019). 
There were two Important Protocol Deviations in the study, both related to inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
One randomised patient did not meet the inclusion criteria for the LCI2.5 value at screening. This 
patient discontinued the study. Another patient had a change in antibiotic therapy for pulmonary 
disease within 28 days before Day 1.

Baseline data 
A total of 67 patients were included in the FAS. Most patients were female (n=37, 55.2%) and White 
(n=64, 95.5%). The mean (SD) age at screening was 8.6 (1.7) years. Comparable baseline 
demographics were observed in the TEZ/IVA group with respect to the overall FAS population of study 
115.

In total, 52 (77.6%) subjects had the F/F genotype and 15 (22.4%) subjects had F/RF genotypes. The 
TEZ/IVA group included 42 patients with an F/F mutation and 12 with an F/RF mutation. All patients 
with a F/RF genotype harboured a mutation of residual function included in the adult indication. The 
included RF mutations were 2789+5G>A (n=3); 3849+10kbC>T (n=5); A455E (n=2); 3272-26A>G 
(n=3); R117C (n=1); and P67L (n=1). 
The mean (SD) LCI2.5 at baseline was 9.54 (1.97) and mean (SD) at baseline was ppFEV1 87.1 (12.2) 
percentage points.  
Most subjects (n=64, 95.5%) weighed <40 kg at baseline. A total of 28 patients weighted ≥30 to less 
than 40 kg.  
The mean (SD) weight at baseline was 29.4 (6.7) kg, and the mean (SD) baseline weight z-score was -
0.24 (0.70), i.e., within the ±2SD of the population of reference indicative of normal weight. Similarly, 
the mean (SD) baseline BMI was 16.13 (1.56) kg/m2 and the mean (SD) baseline BMI z-score was -
0.26 (0.78). The mean (SD) baseline height was 134.1 (12.0) cm and the mean (SD) baseline height 
z-score was -0.03 (1.02). 
The majority of subjects (79.1%) were negative for Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the 2 years before 
study start. Although not shown in Table 11, all homozygous F508del subjects had exocrine pancreatic 
insufficiency as the maximum value of faecal elastase-1 at baseline was 94 µg/g. All F/RF subjects 
were pancreatic sufficient. 
Baseline characteristics have also been provided by genotype within the TEZ/IVA group. Among F/F 
subjects (n=42), 47.6% (20/42) were males and the mean (SD) age was 8.5 (1.6) years. Forty-one 
(97.6%) weighed less than 40 kg and the median (min, max) weight-for-age z-score was -0.31 (-1.86, 
1.42). Mean (SD) ppFEV1 was 85.1 percentage points (12.9) with a minimum value of 57.9.  Mean 
(SD) LCI2.5 was 9.84 (2.17) and mean (SD) sweat chloride was 107.1 mmol/l (6.5). In the subgroup 
of F/RF subjects (n=12), 41.7% were males and the mean (SD) age was 8.5 (1.9) years. Almost 92% 
of them weighed less than 40 kg with a median (min, max) weight-for-age z-score of -0.01 (-1.01, 
0.93), a mean (SD) ppFEV1 of 91.2 percentage points (12.4), a mean (SD) LCI2.5 of 8.60 (1.30) and

a mean sweat chloride of 73.5 (25.2) mmol/l. Overall, these baseline data show that disease severity 
is higher in homozygous F508del subjects than in heterozygous F508del/RF subjects. 
Medical history 
The most common medical history conditions (≥30% overall incidence) were CF lung disease 
(Preferred term (PT): CF lung; 85.1%), pancreatic insufficiency (PT: pancreatic failure; 73.1%), and 
constipation (31.3%). 
Prior and concomitant medications 
The most common medications (≥30% of total subjects) prior to the start of the study were sodium 
chloride (88.1%), dornase alfa (77.6%), pancreatin (73.1%), and salbutamol (59.7%). A total of 3 
patients were being treated with Orkambi prior to study start. One patient was randomised to placebo, 
the other two to TEZ/IVA. 
All subjects took concomitant medications during the study. The most common concomitant 
medications (occurring in ≥30% of subjects) were consistent with a diagnosis of CF and included 
sodium chloride (88.1%), dornase alfa (79.1%), pancreatin (73.1%), and salbutamol (61.2%).  
Numbers analysed 
A total of 69 patients were randomised. A total of 67 received at least one study dose and were 
included in the FAS analyses.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoint – TEZ/IVA within- group absolute change in LCI2.5 from baseline through 
week 8  
The mean (SD) LCI2.5 at baseline was 9.56 (2.06) and 8.90 (1.80) at week 8 for the TEZ/IVA group. 
The within-group LS mean (SE) absolute change from baseline in LCI2.5 through Week 8 was -0.51 
(0.11) (95% CI: -0.74 to -0.29; P <0.0001) (see also Figure 10). The upper bound of the 95% CI (-
0.29) was below the pre-specified maximum placebo effect of -0.10.

Figure 10 MMRM Analysis of Absolute Change From Baseline in LCI2.5 at Each Visit Within 
TEZ/IVA Group, VX16-661-115 Full Analysis Set 
The MMRM analysis makes use of all available data but at week 8, data were only available for 49 
patients out of the 54 in the TEZ/IVA FAS which represents nearly 10% of missing data. Similarly, the 
analysis through week 8 takes the risk of mitigating deleterious effects over time compared to the 
change from baseline at week 8. Therefore, additional analyses were requested by CHMP. First, the 
MAH was requested to provide an analysis of the between-treatment difference versus placebo at 
Week 8 using placebo mean imputation for all patients with data not recorded at that week. This has 
been performed using an MMRM analysis. At baseline, the mean (SD) LCI2.5 values were 9.67 (1.65) 
and 9.56 (2.06) in the placebo and the TEZ/IVA groups respectively. The LS mean difference vs. 
placebo at week 8 was -0.59 (95% CI: -1.22, 0.05).  The same analysis restricted to F/F subjects 
resulted in a LS mean treatment difference vs. placebo of -0.57 (95% CI: -1.23, 0.09). Then, a 
reanalysis of the TEZ/IVA within-group absolute change in LCI2.5 at Week 8 and through Week 8 using 
MMRM with baseline as a covariate and placebo-mean used for imputation of missing data. This 
analysis was performed for the overall TEZ/IVA group, F/F subjects, and F/RF subjects (Table 14).

error  
Notes: Baseline is the most recent non-missing measurement before the first dose of study drug. Analysis included 
all measurements up to Week 8, both on-treatment measurements and measurements after treatment 
discontinuation. Missing values at Week 8 are imputed with the mean of placebo subjects at the Week 8 Visit 
(10.05), based on summary statistics. The mixed model for repeated measures included visit, baseline LCI2.5, and 
mutation group (F/F vs. F/RF) as covariates. The model used an unstructured covariance and Kenward-Roger 
degrees of freedom.  
The overall TEZ/IVA group (F/F and F/RF combined) had a within-group change in LCI2.5 of -0.48, with 
a 95% CI that excludes the predefined placebo effect of -0.10. Analysis of change in LCI2.5 by 
genotype was consistent with subgroup analysis based on summary statistics in which the mean 
absolute change in LCI2.5 from baseline through week 8 was -0.39 (95% CI: -0.67, -0.10) in F/F 
patients and -0.92 (95%CI: -1.65, -0.20) in F/RF patients based on data from 42 F/F patients and 12 
F/RF patients (see Table 16 further below). 
Secondary Endpoints 
•  Sweat chloride test 
In the TEZ/IVA group, the mean (SD) sweat chloride at baseline was 99.2 (19.5) mmol/l and at week 8 
(n=49) it was 88.4 (18.6) mmol/l. The LS mean (SE) absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride 
at Week 8 was -12.3 (1.5) mmol/L (95% CI: -15.3, -9.3) in the TEZ/IVA group (p<0.0001), (Figure 
11).

Similarly to the primary endpoint, an analysis of the absolute change from baseline at Week 8 using 
placebo mean imputation for all patients with data not recorded at Week 8 was requested by CHMP. 
The MMRM analysis of the absolute change from baseline at week 8 in sweat chloride using placebo-
mean imputation yielded a LS mean difference vs. placebo of -10.9 mmol/l (95% CI: -18.4, -3.3). The 
same analysis restricted to F/F subjects resulted in a LS mean treatment difference vs. placebo of -
10.0 mmol/l (95% CI: -17.0, -3.0).  
•  CFQ-R Respiratory domain child version 
In the TEZ/IVA treatment group, the mean (SD) respiratory domain score of the CFQ-R was 84.6 
(11.4) points at baseline. The LS mean (SE) absolute change from baseline in the CFQ-R respiratory 
domain score through Week 8 was 2.3 (1.2) points (95% CI; -0.1, 4.6), (Figure 12).

Other Endpoints  
•  Percent predicted FEV1  
In the TEZ/IVA group, the mean (SD) ppFEV1 at baseline was of 86.5 (12.9) percentage ooints. At 
week 8, the mean (SD) ppFEV1 was 89.9 (12.4) percentage points. The LS mean (SE) difference in 
FEV1 from baseline through week 8 was 2.8 (0.9) percentage points (95% CI: 1.0, 4.6) (Figure 13). 
Summary statistics of the change from baseline at week 8 and through week 8 for ppFEV1 are 
provided by genotype for the TEZ/IVA group. The mean (SD) absolute change absolute change through 
week 8 was 2.6 (7.0) percentage points in F/F patients (n=41) and 3.7 (7.2) percentage points in F/RF 
patients (n=12).

group study VX16-661-115 
An analysis of the absolute change from baseline at Week 8 using placebo mean imputation for all 
patients with data not recorded at Week 8 was requested by CHMP for LCI5.0. For F/F subjects, the 
MMRM analysis of the absolute change from baseline at week 8 in LCI5.0 using placebo-mean 
imputation yielded a LS mean difference vs. placebo of -0.19 (95% CI: -0.46, 0.09).  
•  Exocrine pancreatic function  
In the TEZ/IVA group, baseline values of faecal elastse-1 (FE-1) and immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) 
differed between F/F subjects and F/RF subjects. All 40 F/F subjects with baseline data had FE-1 levels 
≤200 µg/g, consistent with pancreatic insufficiency whereas all F/RF subjects had baseline FE-1 levels 
≥500 µg/g, consistent with normal pancreatic function.  
No subject with a baseline FE-1 level ≤200 μg/g became pancreatic sufficient (i.e., had an FE-1 level 
>200 μg/g) after TEZ/IVA treatment. The mean (SD) change from baseline in FE-1 at Week 8 among 
pancreatic-insufficient subjects in the TEZ/IVA group was 1.6 (16.9) μg/g. All of the 10 subjects with 
baseline data in the placebo group were pancreatic insufficient at both baseline and Week 8.  
The normal range levels for IRT were 140 to 400 ng/mL; values below the LLQ were imputed with half 
the LLQ value, or 7.0 ng/mL. At baseline, pancreatic-insufficient subjects had a median IRT value of 
7.0 ng/mL (i.e., >50% of subjects’ IRT levels were below the LLQ of the assay) and a mean (SD) IRT 
value of 48.3 (102.2) ng/mL. After 8 weeks of TEZ/IVA treatment, the median IRT value remained 7.0 
ng/mL and the mean IRT value decreased with a mean (SD) change from baseline of -20.4 (53.4) 
ng/mL. For pancreatic-sufficient subjects, the mean (SD) baseline IRT level was 544.2 (308.6) ng/mL. 
After 8 weeks of TEZ/IVA treatment, the mean (SD) change in IRT was -235.4 (246.2) ng/mL. 
A comparison of the change from baseline in faecal elastase-1 and immunoreactive trypsinogen by 
baseline FE-1 values (≤200 μg/g vs. > 200 μg/g) observed in the studies of lumacaftor/ivacaftor and 
ivacaftor alone in children of the same age range was requested. In response, it has been clarified that 
the assays used to assess FE-1 were the same in study 115 and study 809-109 (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) 
but differed in case of IRT. The MAH stated that direct comparisons of these parameters across these 
studies are hampered given the differences in treatment duration (8 weeks in study 115 vs. 24 weeks 
in study 109), subject genotype, assay collection, and statistical methodology. Nevertheless, data were 
Assessment report  
EMA/628136/2020 
Page 61/117 
 
 
  
 
 
provided for study 109 (homozygous F508del children treated for 24 weeks with lumacaftor/ivacaftor) 
which showed similar results to those of study 115 in F/F patients.  
In the IVA program, FE-1 and IRT were evaluated in study 770-110, which enrolled subjects 6 years of 
age and older with the R117H mutation; these data are not comparable to those in the TEZ/IVA 
program due to the different age range (including mostly adult subjects) and different genotype 
(usually associated to exocrine pancreatic sufficiency at young ages).   
•  Drug Acceptability Questionnaire 
Results of the Drug Acceptability Questionnaire indicated that, after taking TEZ/I.VA, patients generally 
either “liked it very much” (40.7%) or “liked it a little” (33.3%). Ten (18.5%) patients were “not 
sure” and 1 (1.9%) patient “disliked it very much”.

Responder analysis for LCI2.5, sweat chloride, and the respiratory domain of CFQ-R for F/F subjects 
treated with placebo and TEZ/IVA in Study 115 are shown in Table 19.  
Table 19 Percentage of Subjects Reaching Specified Improvements for Selected Efficacy 
Endpoints – Study 115 FAS  
In the overall TEZ/IVA group, the percentage of subjects with improvement from baseline in LCI2.5 
(i.e., change from baseline through week 8 of ≤ -1) was 22.6% in Study 115 as compared to 16.7% in 
the F/F subgroup. As for sweat chloride, in the overall TEZ/IVA group, the percentage of subjects 
showing an improvement from baseline (i.e., change from baseline at week 8 of ≤-10 mmol/L) was 
56.3% versus 60.5% in the F/F subgroup. A change from baseline in the respiratory domain score of 
CFQ-R ≥ 4 points was achieved by 38.9% of subjects in the overall TEZ/IVA group versus 35.7% in the 
F/F subgroup.

Notes:  
A shift in the body weight cut-off for dosing recommendations is proposed, i.e., from ≥ 40 kg to ≥ 30 
kg based on model-based analysis of systemic exposure of TEZ, M1-TEZ, and IVA in children versus 
older patients.  TEZ 100 mg qd/IVA 150 mg q12h has not been investigated in children weighing ≥30 
to less than 40 kg in study 115.  
Primary analysis: data are missing on the primary endpoint at week 8 for 5 children out of the 54 in 
the FAS.

Analysis description: The primary analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint is based on a mixed-
effects model for repeated measures with LCI2.5 at each time point as the outcome variable. The 
estimated mean change from baseline through Week 8 in LCI2.5 for subjects treated with TEZ/IVA 
along with the corresponding 95% CI is provided. If the upper bound of the 95% CI is below the pre-
defined maximum placebo effect of -0.10, it will be interpreted as sufficient evidence to achieve the 
primary efficacy objective.  
Additional analyses were requested between the TEZ/IVA and the placebo groups using placebo-mean 
imputation for patients with data not available at week 8 for LCI2.5, sweat chloride, and LCI5.0. The 
results of these additional analyses are reflected in the corresponding sections of the report.  
*No multiplicity adjustment was performed for hypothesis testing. P values provided for the secondary 
and other endpoints are considered nominal. 
Supportive study 
Study VX15-661-113 (study 113): A Phase 3, Open-label Study to Evaluate the 
Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and Tolerability of VX-661 in Combination with Ivacaftor in 
Subjects 6 Through 11 Years of Age With Cystic Fibrosis, Homozygous or Heterozygous for 
the F508del-CFTR Mutation. 
Study 113 has been previously assessed in procedure EMEA/H/C/004682/P46/006 and 
EMEA/H/C/002494/P46/0027. The PK results of both parts of the study are discussed in section 2.6.2.  
Pharmacokinetics.  
Methods 
Study 113 is a 2-part (Part A and Part B), open-label, multicenter study.  
Study 113, Part A (Study 113A) 
Study 113A included a Screening Period (28 days), Treatment Period (14 days) and a Wash-out/Safety 
Follow-up Period (14 days) to evaluate off-drug response (see Figure 14). Subjects were enrolled into 
2 weight-based cohorts with a cut-off value of 25 kg.  
Figure 14 Schematic of Study Design for Study 113A  
Study 113, Part B (Study 113B)  
Study 113B included a Screening Period (28 days), Treatment Period (24 weeks [± 5 days]), and 
Safety Follow-up Visit (4 weeks [± 7 days]) (see Figure 15).

Figure 15 Schematic of Study Design for Study 113B 
Study Participants 
Patients aged 6 through 11 years and weighing >15 kg at the screening visit with a confirmed 
diagnosis of CF and an eligible CFTR genotype were eligible for enrolment. The genotype was 
confirmed at the screening visit. Patients homozygous for F508del/F508del were eligible for both parts 
of the study.  
In study 113A, heterozygous F508del were eligible for enrolment if they had a second CFTR allele that 
met at least 1 of the following criteria: (1) the mutation was predicted to have residual function (2) the 
mutation causes a gating defect that has been clinically demonstrated to be IVA-responsive or (3) the 
mutation was not likely to respond to TEZ and/or IVA therapy. In study 113B, only heterozygous 
F508del subjects with a second allele with a CFTR mutation predicted to have residual function were 
eligible for enrolment.  
The lists below represent acceptable mutations for the second CFTR allele for heterozygous subjects. 
The CF diagnosis was confirmed if sweat chloride was ≥60 mmol/l for all subjects. If sweat chloride 
was less than 60 mmol/l for heterozygous patients with a mutation that was either predicted to have 
residual function or was an IVA-responsve gating mutation, the patients were required to have 
documented evidence of chronic sinopulmonary disease and/or gastrointestinal disease consistent with 
a diagnosis of CF as judged by the principal investigator.  
Assessment report  
EMA/628136/2020 
Page 68/117 
 
 
  
 
 
In addition, subjects must have predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (ppFEV1) ≥40 
percentage points adjusted for age, sex, height, and ethnicity using the Global Lung Function Initiative 
(GLI) equation at the Screening Visit and stable CF disease at the Screening Visit. 
Key exclusion criteria for both parts of the study were as follows: 
-  History of any comorbidity reviewed at the Screening Visit such as history of cirrhosis with portal 
hypertension or history of risk factors for Torsades de Pointes. 
-  Any of the following abnormal laboratory values at the Screening Visit: 
o  Hemoglobin <10 g/dL 
o  Abnormal liver function defined as any 2 or more of the following:  ≥3 × upper limit of 
normal (ULN) aspartate aminotransferase (AST),  ≥3 × ULN alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT),  ≥3 × ULN gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT),  ≥3 × ULN alkaline phosphatase 
(ALP),  ≥2 × ULN total bilirubin 
o  Abnormal liver function, defined as any increase of ≥5 × ULN ALT or AST 
o  Abnormal renal function, defined as glomerular filtration rate ≤45 mL/min/1.73 m2 
(calculated by the Counahan-Barratt equation) 
Treatments 
The following doses were administered during Part A: 
• 
• 
Patients < 25 kg: TEZ 50 mg qd/IVA 75 mg q12h 
Patients ≥ 25 kg: TEZ 50 mg qd/ IVA 150 mg q12h 
A review of safety, tolerability, and PK data was completed by an internal Vertex team after completion 
of Part A to select the TEZ/IVA dose regimens for Part B. Based on this review the dosing scheme was 
altered. The cut of value for dosing was raised to 40 kg, and the TEZ dose of the high dosing regimen 
was increased (from 50 mg to 100 mg). No dose adjustments were made throughout the duration of 
treatment of Part B. 
The following doses were provided during part B:  
• 
• 
Patients < 40 kg: TEZ 50 mg qd/IVA 75 mg q12h 
Patients ≥ 40 kg: TEZ 100 mg qd/ IVA 150 mg q12h 
Additional Dietary Restrictions/Prohibited Medications 
During part A of the study, patients were asked to refrain from other investigational drugs, strenuous 
exercise, uncontrolled use of dietary/nutritional supplements, tobacco, juices, or other foods and 
medications that may affect drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters as predefined in the protocol.  
During part B of the study, medications and certain foods that may interfere with the CYP3A pathway 
were subject of certain restrictions or prohibited during the screening period and during the study.  
Prior and Concomitant Medications 
Subjects abstained from all restricted concomitant medications as described in the exclusion criteria. 
Subjects were recommended to remain on their stable CF medication regimen from 4 weeks before 
Day 1 through Day 14 (Part A) or through Week 24 (Part B) or, if applicable, through the Safety 
Follow-up Visit. 
Objective(s) 
Assessment report  
EMA/628136/2020 
Page 69/117 
 
 
  
The primary objective was PK in Study 113A and safety in Study 113B. PK and efficacy were included 
as secondary outcome measures in study 113B. A summary of the objectives of Study 113 objectives 
is outlined in Table 21.  
Table 21 Study 113 Objectives 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
Part A and Part B: Plasma PK parameters of TEZ, M1-TEZ, M2-TEZ, IVA, M1-IVA, and M6-IVA 
Efficacy Assessments 
Part B: Spirometry, weight and weight z-score, height and height z-score, BMI and BMI z-score, sweat 
chloride, and CFQ-R 
Absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 was analysed using a restricted maximum likelihood (REML)-
based mixed effect model for repeated measures (MMRM) approach that included visit and baseline 
ppFEV1 (continuous) as fixed effects, and subject as a random effect. An unstructured (co)variance 
structure was used to model the within-subject errors. If the model failed to converge, a compound 
symmetry covariance structure was considered. The degrees of freedom of the denominator was 
approximated by the Kenward-Roger’s method. 
Other outcome measures  
A similar MMRM model as described for absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline through Week 24 was 
used for the absolute change in FEV1 (L), relative change form baseline in ppFEV1, and Absolute 
Change from Baseline in CFQ-R Respiratory Domain Score. For the outcome measures Absolute 
Change from Baseline in Weight, Height, BMI, and associated z-scores the similar MMRM model was 
used for measuring the change from baseline at Week 24.  
The same slightly adjusted model was also applied for the Absolute Change from Baseline in Sweat 
Chloride Through Week 4 and Through Week 24. Because the post-baseline assessment of sweat 
chloride was performed at week 4, the estimated change at week 4 was used to assess the absolute 
change in sweat chloride through week 4.  
Lung clearance index measured by MBW was part of an optional exploratory substudy conducted at a 
subset of sites. The LCI substudy was used to evaluate an MBW device and over-reading process that 
were new to the Vertex CF program. Additional analysis of LCI results is ongoing and may be 
presented in an additional report.

Safety Assessments 
Part A and Part B: Adverse events, clinical laboratory assessments (serum chemistry, haematology, 
coagulation studies, lipids, vitamins, and urinalysis), standard 12-lead ECGs, vital signs, pulse 
oximetry, physical examinations (PEs), and spirometry. 
Safety was the primary objective of Part B. Safety analyses were based on the Safety Set in each 
study part. Only descriptive analysis of safety was performed (i.e., no statistical hypothesis testing was 
performed).  
Part B: Ophthalmologic examinations, 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Not applicable (single arm study).  
Statistical methods 
Sample Size and Power 
Part A: Sample size calculations were conducted to estimate the precision in determining TEZ clearance 
in paediatric subjects in the 2 weight-based cohorts. The method used non-compartmental analysis 
(NCA)-based PK parameters, such as clearance and volume, in adults with the assumption that there 
would be similar variability in clearance in adults and paediatric subjects 6 through 11 years of age 
within each weight group. The calculations indicated that data from 8 subjects would allow 80% power 
to target a 95% CI within 60% and 140% of the geometric mean (geo mean) estimate of clearance for 
TEZ in each paediatric subgroup (cohort). Therefore, approximately 16 subjects (approximately 8 
subjects in each cohort) were planned for enrolment in Part A. 
Part B: Planned enrolment was approximately 56 subjects. Assuming a 10% dropout rate, 
approximately 50 subjects were expected to complete Part B. With a total sample size of 50 subjects 
completing the study, there would be a 92.3% chance of observing AEs in at least 1 subject if the true 
incidence rate were 5%, and a 99.5% chance of observing AEs in at least 1 subject if the true 
incidence rate were 10%. These probabilities were calculated by assuming a binomial distribution for 
the number of AEs using SAS®. 
Analysis Sets 
The following analysis sets were established:  
•  Safety Set (Part A and Part B) defined as all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug. 
•  All Subjects Set (Part A) defined as subjects who are eligible for study enrolment and received a 
subject identification number or were dosed. Subject data listings were presented based on the 
Safety Set Part B. 
• 
• 
PK Set (Part A and Part B) defined as subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug and for 
whom the primary PK data are considered to be sufficient and interpretable. 
Full Analysis Set (Part B Only) defined as subjects who carry the intended CFTR mutations and 
received at least 1 dose of study drug. All efficacy analyses are based on the FAS, except for LCI 
endpoints. Incomplete/Missing data were not imputed, unless specified otherwise. No formal 
statistical analyses were performed to detect or remedy the presence of statistical outliers, unless 
specified otherwise. 
Variables 
Assessment report  
EMA/628136/2020

The treatment emergent (TE) period for Part B will correspond to data from first dose of study drug in 
Part B through the Safety Follow-up Visit or 28 days after the last dose in Part B for subjects who do 
not have an Safety Follow-up Visit. 
Baseline for Part A was defined as the most recent non-missing measurement (scheduled or 
unscheduled) collected prior to the first dose of study drug in Part A. Baseline for Part B was similarly 
defined.  
The absolute change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 through week 24 was defined as the 
average of the absolute changes from baseline in ppFEV1 at each post-baseline scheduled visit. 
Absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 was analyzed using a restricted maximum likelihood (REML)-
based mixed effect model for repeated measures (MMRM) approach that included visit and baseline 
ppFEV1 (continuous) as fixed effects, and subject as a random effect.  
The change from baseline in weight, height, BMI, and associated z-scores at week 24, the absolute 
change from baseline in sweat chloride through week 4 and through week 24, and the absolute change 
from baseline in CFQ-R respiratory domain score through week 24 were calculated using a similar 
MMRM model.

Table 25 Baseline Characteristics, Part A Safety Set 
The MAH has clarified that in Part A, 5 children were homozygous for F508del, 4 had an F/RF mutation 
and 4 remaining children were heterozygous F508del/A559T (n=1) and F508del/G551D (n=3). The last 
four were not allowed to enrol in Part B due to the emerging data about the potential lack of efficacy of 
TEZ/IVA for heterozygous F508del/G551D; the other genotype was not eligible for Part B.  
Median BMI-for-age z-score was 0.43 (min, max: -2.37, 1.78), median weight-for-age z-score was 
0.37 (-1.52, 1.82) and median height-for-age z-score was 0.46 (-1.92, 1.11) for the 13 children 
enrolled in Part A.   
Medical history in Part A was consistent with the diagnosis of CF in this age group. The most common 
medical history conditions (≥30% overall incidence) by PT were CF lung (100%), pancreatic 
insufficiency (92.3%), asthma (53.8%), constipation (46.2%), rhinitis allergic (46.2%), 
gastroesophageal reflux disease (38.5%), chronic sinusitis (38.5%), and cough (38.5%). 
All subjects took concomitant medications during Part A. The most common concomitant medications 
(≥ 30% overall incidence) were salbutamol (84.6%), pancreatin (76.9%), dornase alfa (69.2%), 
sodium chloride (69.2%), fluticasone propionate (53.8%), colecalciferol (38.5%), aquadeks/07679501 
(30.8%), and loratadine (30.8%). 
Study 113B 
Baseline subject demographics in Study 113B are presented by CFTR mutation type (homozygous 
F508del [F/F] versus heterozygous F508del and a second allele that results in residual function [F/RF]) 
in Table 26.  
The majority of subjects were white (97.1%) and not Hispanic or Latino (95.7%). A total of 51.4% of 
subjects were male. The median age in Part B was 8.0 years (range: 6 to 11 years).

Table 26 Baseline demographics in F/F and F/RF Subjects, Study 113 B, Safety Set 
Baseline characteristics in Part B (including anthropometric z-scores and percentiles) are presented by 
mutation type in Table 27. In total, 61 subjects (87.1%) were homozygous for the F508del mutation 
and 9 subjects (12.9%) were heterozygous for F508del and a second allele that results in residual 
CFTR function. All included children with heterozygous F/RF had mutations as allowed in the label.  
At baseline, the mean ppFEV1 was 91.1 percentage points.  Most subjects (88.6%) weighed <40 kg at 
baseline. The number of patients with a body weight ≥ 30 kg to less than 40 kg was n=21 (30%); the 
number of patients weighing ≥ 40 kg was 8/70 (11.4%). The mean (SD) weight at baseline was 30.7 
(10.0) kg, and the mean weight z-score was 0.20 (0.94), indicative of normal weight. Similarly, the 
mean (SD) baseline BMI was 17.44 (2.69) kg/m2 and the mean (SD) baseline BMI z-score was 0.37 
(0.90). The mean (SD) baseline height was 131.0 (13.0) cm and mean (SD) baseline height z-score 
was -0.07 (0.98).  
At baseline, the majority of subjects used an inhaled bronchodilator (98.6%), dornase alfa (88.6%), 
and inhaled hypertonic saline (72.9%). The majority of subjects (78.6%) were negative for 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the 2 years prior to the start of Part B 
Medical history in Part B was consistent with the diagnosis of CF in this age group. The most common 
medical history conditions (≥30% overall incidence) were CF lung disease (92.9%), pancreatic failure 
(90.0%), constipation (44.3%), and gastroesophageal reflux disease (35.7%).

Overall, the baseline data provided by genotype show the highest severity of the disease in 
homozygous F508del subjects as expected even at this young age. Homozygous F508del subjects had 
a median (min, max) weight-for-age percentile of 51.46 (6.43, 99.50) as compared to heterozygous 
patients (i.e., 74.11 [11.83, 95.71]). Similarly, median (min, max) height-for-age percentile is 39.42 
(2.50, 99.10) as compared to 51.33 (21.03, 93.70). This results in median (min, max) BMI percentile 
of 69.05 (7.47, 98.43) vs. 70.77 (16.41, 94.55) in heterozygous patients. In subjects with cystic 
fibrosis aged 2 to 18 years the target is 0 SD (50th percentile) of BMI for a healthy, same-age 
population. This is considered as indicative of adequate nutritional status. However, when assessing 
BMI the change in height percentile/SD score should be considered, as stunted (low height-for-age) 
children can have a normal BMI (Turck et al 2016). This seems to be the case in the population of 
homozygous F508del children for whom the height percentile is well below the 50th percentile in spite 
of which the BMI percentile is above 50.  
Conduct of the study  
The final study protocol of study 113 is Version 3.0, dated 19 July 2017. Study initiation: 11 Nov 2016 
(date first eligible subject signed the informed consent form). Part A Completion: 5 April 2017 (date 
last subject completed last visit in Part A). Part B Completion: 11 Sept 2018 (date last subject 
completed the last visit). 
The date of first subject entry for Study 113B was 25 October 2017. 
The study protocol was amended 2 times. Table 28 provides a list of the protocol versions, their dates, 
and the major changes introduced with every amendment.

Table 28 Summary of Study VX15-661-113 Protocol Amendments
Planned methods of analyses were provided in the interim analysis (IA) statistical analysis plan (SAP) 
for Part A (SAP IA1 Part A Version 1.0, dated 11 January 2017), the Part B SAP for Part B (SAP Part B 
Version 1.0, dated 22 June 2018) and the clinical pharmacology analysis plan (CPAP, CPAP Version 
1.0).  
Changes were also made in the SAP for Part B compared to the protocol. One of the amendments was 
to clarify the details of the mixed effect model repeated measures (MMRM) approach considering the 
study design and study population. The protocol for Study 113 was amended to create Version 3.0, 
dated 19 July 2017. This version of the protocol states that “treatment” and “treatment-by-visit” would 
be included as fixed effects in the MMRM. The SAP for Study 113 Part B removed “treatment” and 
“treatment-by-visit” as fixed effects for the MMRM model and further clarified that “subject” is included 
as a random effect in the analyses. These changes to the SAP were made because a difference in 
“treatment” effect by dose was not expected, as the weight-based dosing regimen was intended to 
match study drug exposures for subjects receiving different doses. Therefore, per the SAP, only the 
overall TEZ/IVA treatment effect was analyzed in the MMRM model.  
There were no important protocol deviations in Part A, and three important protocol deviations in Part 
B. In Part B, the mean (SD) compliance was 99.50% (2.99%). One subject (TEZ 50 mg qd/IVA 75 mg 
q12h) was <80% compliant, one subject (TEZ 50 mg qd/IVA 75 mg q12h) was enrolled in the study 
without review of their coagulation lab results and one subject (TEZ 50 mg qd/IVA 75 mg q12h) began 
the washout of physician prescribed LUM/IVA prior to signing the ICF.  
Outcomes and estimation 
All efficacy endpoints were secondary outcome measures. The analyses described in this section were 
based on the FAS, unless specified otherwise. The analysis included all available measurements 
through the last assessment, including measurements after treatment discontinuation. 
There was no multiplicity adjustment, the p values provided for the secondary and other endpoints are 
considered nominal. 
•  Absolute Change from Baseline in ppFEV1 Through Week 24 
The LS mean absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline through Week 24 was 0.9 percentage points 
(95% CI: -0.6, 2.3; nominal P value: 0.2361) (Table 29).

F/F and F/RF subjects had similar absolute increases from baseline in ppFEV1 through Week 24. For 
F/F subjects, the mean (SD) absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 through Week 24 was 0.9 (6.7) 
percentage points. For F/RF subjects, the mean (SD) absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 through 
Week 24 was 0.9 (5.1) percentage points.  
These data are consistent with the well-preserved baseline lung function values.

No sensitivity analysis for missing data was performed. This is acceptable for two reasons: premature 
discontinuation was small (4.3%) and efficacy is a secondary objective and no statistical conclusion 
can be drawn.  
•  Relative Change from Baseline in ppFEV1 Through Week 24 
The LS mean relative change in ppFEV1 from baseline through Week 24 was 1.4% (95% CI: -0.4, 
3.1).  
•  Absolute Change from Baseline in Weight, Height, BMI, and Associated z-scores at 
Week 24 
Table 30 presents the MMRM analysis results for BMI, weight, height, and associated z-scores. 
The LS mean absolute change from baseline in weight at Week 24 was 1.7 kg (95% CI: 1.3, 2.0). The 
LS mean absolute change from baseline in height at Week 24 was 2.7 cm (95% CI: 2.4, 2.9). The LS 
mean absolute change from baseline in BMI at Week 24 was 0.23 kg/m2 (95% CI: 0.06, 0.4).  
The LS mean absolute change from baseline in weight z-score at Week 24 was 0.0 (95% CI: -0.05, 
0.05). The LS mean absolute change from baseline in height z-score at Week 24 was 0.0 (95% CI: -
0.05, 0.05). The LS mean absolute change from baseline in BMI z-score at Week 24 was -0.03 (95% 
CI: -0.10, 0.04).

2.7.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
In the EU, Kalydeco 150 mg tablets, is currently approved in a combination regimen with Symkevi 
tablets, for the treatment of patients with CF 12 years of age and older who are homozygous for the 
F508del-CFTR mutation or who are heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation and have 1 of the 
following mutations in the CFTR gene: P67L, R117C, L206W, R352Q, A455E, D579G, 711+3A→G, 
S945L, S977F, R1070W, D1152H, 2789+5G→A, 3272-26A→G, and 3849+10kbC→T.  
The current application is to add a new strength (Kalydeco 75 mg tablets) for the use in combination 
use with Symkevi to children aged aged 6 to less than 12 years old. This age range is based on the 
partial extrapolation of efficacy from adults and adolescents to children, supported by the PK and 
safety study 113 and the pivotal phase 3 study 115. 
The extrapolation strategy is justified as the underlying genetic and molecular aetiology of CF is similar 
across age ranges and no age-dependency in the mechanism of action of the CFTR modulators has 
been observed. In addition, the pathogenesis of the disease is also comparable across paediatric and 
older populations although there may be a significant age-dependency for the presence of certain 
symptoms and signs of the disease with younger children generally less affected than older patients or 
with a different pattern of organ damage. However, the biochemical defect of the defective chloride 
channels is present from birth and because of the longstanding defect, it results in sequelae in the 
lung, pancreas and other organs emerging progressively throughout childhood and into adulthood. 
These sequelae may negatively affect the course of the disease over time as shown by the prevalence 
of chronic lung infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and of pulmonary exacerbations in adulthood 
compared to childhood.  
Thus, paediatric studies aimed at investigating the PK and safety of the study drug are considered 
acceptable to demonstrate efficacy based on extrapolation from adults to younger patients. There is a 
need for a good understanding of the PK of the candidate drug in the different paediatric age groups 
affected by the disease. Furthermore, the safety profile should be established in the paediatric studies 
performed so that a bridge between the adult and paediatric population can be made. The efficacy of 
ivacaftor in a combination regimen with Symkevi has been established in phase 3 studies in patients 
aged 12 years and older by showing improvement in lung function using FEV1, sweat chloride and 
quality of life compared to placebo. This led to the EU approval of Symkevi for CF patients homozygous 
for F508del/F508del and heterozygous for specific F/RF mutations. Bridging the efficacy from older 
patients (source population) to children aged 6 to less than 12 years of age is based on matching the 
systemic exposure which has been shown efficacious and safe in the source population.     
Overall, the approach proposed by the MAH was considered to be in line with the principles described 
in ICH E11 and the EMA reflection paper on the use of extrapolation in the development of medicines 
for paediatrics. The MAH sought CHMP scientific advice for Study 115 after the Phase 3 data in subjects 
≥12 years old became available. Overall, CHMP agreed that from a mechanistic point of view, the 
therapeutic rationale in the older population could, in principle, equally apply to younger populations. 
The proposed 8-week treatment duration and the use of LCI2.5 as primary endpoint were also 
acknowledged provided that the open label extension study includes periodic efficacy evaluations. 
Regarding the primary endpoint, CHMP clearly expressed a clear preference for a formal comparison 
versus placebo in the absolute change in LCI2.5 from baseline at week 8 rather than the proposed 
TEZ/IVA within-group change through week 8.

Design and conduct of clinical studies 
To support this extension of indication, two paediatric studies have been conducted, i.e., the pivotal 
study 115 and the supportive study 113. Upon request by CHMP, interim results of an open-label 
extension study (study 116) have been provided.  
Study 113 is a 2-part (Part A and Part B), open-label study to assess the pharmacokinetics, safety, and 
tolerability of tezacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in subjects 6 through 11 years of age with CF, 
homozygous or heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation. The primary objectives were PK in part A 
(14 days) and safety in part B (24 weeks); PK and efficacy were included as secondary outcome 
measures in study 113B.  
Based on the PK data of study 113A and model-based simulations, the weight cut-off was increased 
from 25 kg to 40 kg for study 113B and study 115 in order to achieve exposures similar to subjects 
≥12 years old across all of the weight ranges, to maintain the same TEZ:IVA dose ratio in the adult 
and paediatric populations, and to avoid exposures of TEZ that would be higher than those achieved in 
the ≥12-year-old population. Upon review of the exposure data from these two studies, an integrated 
popPK analysis of data was performed. The results demonstrated that for subjects 6 through 11 years 
of age who weighed ≥40 kg and received TEZ 100 mg qd/IVA 150 mg q12h, the distribution of 
individual TEZ, M1-TEZ, and IVA exposures were similar to the observed range of subjects 12 years of 
age and older. For subjects 6 through 11 years of age who weighed <40 kg and received TEZ 50 mg 
qd/IVA 75 mg q12h, TEZ parent and IVA parent exposures fell within the lower range of observed 
exposures of subjects 12 years and older. M1-TEZ exposures were similar to those of adult subjects. 
As a consequence, the weight-based posology was shifted from 40 kg to 30 kg to better align with the 
adult exposures. The 30kg cut off is based on the PopPK results previously described and is 
appropriately demonstrated (see section 2.6.2 pharmacokinetics). 
Changes in sweat chloride were assessed in the paediatric studies 113 and 115 as a secondary 
endpoint. The comparison of the sweat chloride changes versus those estimated in the pivotal studies 
106 and 108 in the Symkevi clinical programme shows that the magnitude of the mean reduction in 
sweat chloride is comparable in older patients and in children, thus further supporting extrapolation of 
efficacy to children (see section 2.6.2 pharmacokinetics). 
Study 115 is a double blinded, parallel group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TEZ/IVA in 
patients 6 through 11 years of age with CF, with an F/F or F/RF genotype (8-week duration). Patients 
were stratified by genotype and randomized in a 4:1 ratio to either the TEZ/IVA group or an 
appropriate blinding group for their genotype, i.e., the F/F blinding group received placebo (although 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor was available for homozygous F508del subjects) and the F/RF blinding group 
received IVA monotherapy.  
This study although designed as a randomised, placebo and active comparator-controlled study, can be 
effectively considered as a single arm study due to the following:  
• 
The overall effect size is driven by the TEZ/IVA group as this includes 80% of the population. 
•  No between-treatments comparisons were pre-specified but within-TEZ/IVA group changes.  
•  Each treatment group included different genotypes, i.e., the TEZ/IVA group included both F/F 
and F/RF patients, while the placebo and IVA groups included F/F and F/RF patients 
respectively, hampering a between-treatment comparison.  
• 
The number of patients in the placebo group (n=10) or in the IVA group (n=3) is too small to 
allow sound comparisons between treatment groups.

Patients who weighed <40 kg received a morning dose of TEZ 50 mg/IVA 75 mg (fixed-dose 
combination [FDC] tablet) and an evening dose of IVA 75 mg (tablet). Patients who were ≥40 kg 
received a morning dose of TEZ 100 mg/IVA 150 mg (FDC tablet) and an evening dose of IVA 150 mg 
(tablet). The study is of short duration, i.e. 8 weeks, which was justified on the basis that prior studies 
showed that the effect of CFTR modulator therapy is apparent at week 2 and maintained throughout 
the 24-week duration treatments. Moreover, additional supportive long-term treatment data was 
collected in study 113B.   
The primary endpoint was the TEZ/IVA within-group absolute change from baseline through week 8 in 
LCI2.5, i.e., different from ppFEV1 which is the usual measurement of lung function in older patients. 
This is considered acceptable given that children tend to have a well-preserved lung function as 
measured by spirometry which does not detect the disease in the small airways. The results of the test 
were centrally reviewed which is endorsed.  
The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for the LCI2.5 has not been determined. The natural 
variability for the LCI2.5 is 1 unit2 or 15% of baseline3. An effect larger than the natural variability 
might be regarded as clinically relevant.   
Secondary efficacy endpoints included the TEZ/IV within-group absolute change in sweat chloride and 
in the respiratory domain score of the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised [CFQ-R]. Sweat chloride is 
a pharmacodynamic endpoint and shows the effect of the CFTR modulator therapy on the chloride 
transport. The (respiratory domain of) the CFQ-R (Child and Parent Versions) was used to capture and 
evaluate the impact of TEZ/IVA on patient-reported respiratory symptoms and other aspects of health-
related quality of life. 
Other outcome measures included the absolute change in ppFEV1 as well as in anthropometric 
parameters. Acceptability of the study drugs formulations was also assessed.  
CFTR modulator therapy is a systemic therapy. Therefore, it is expected that it may also have 
additional systemic effects like improvement of the pancreatic function (faecal elastase-1 and 
immunoreactive trypsinogen) and improvement in anthropometric parameters. These effects were 
included for descriptive purposes only.  
The sample size of study 115 is driven by demonstrating that the treatment effect of TEZ/IVA is based 
on a within-group comparison (change from baseline in LCI2.5 in subjects on TEZ/IVA) to exclude a 
maximum possible placebo effect. The size of the placebo effect was based on study 809-109 in which 
treatment with LUM/IVA in homozygous F508del subjects aged 6 through 11 years was assessed. In 
this study, the treatment difference was -1.09 (95% CI: -1.43, -0.75) in favour of LUM/IVA, a 
treatment effect which was considered modest. The placebo group had a mean worsening in LCI2.5 of 
0.08 units with an SD of 1.41; the one-sided 90% lower bound was -0.10 which is used as an estimate 
for the pre-defined maximum possible placebo effect for study 115, i.e., if the upper bound of the 95% 
CI is below the pre-defined maximum placebo effect of -0.10, it will be interpreted as sufficient 
evidence to achieve the primary efficacy objective. However, the magnitude of the maximum placebo 
effect estimated via one-sided 90% lower bound seems not sufficiently conservative.   
The analysis of the primary and of the secondary endpoints was performed using a restricted 
maximum likelihood (REML)-based mixed-effect model for repeated measures (MMRM) for the patients 
in the TEZ/IVA treatment group. The MMRM analysis assumes that patients who do not provide data at 
Week 8 continue to benefit from the treatment. As a result, the treatment effect might be

overestimated. Upon request by CHMP, additional sensitivity analyses using placebo mean imputation 
data for all patients with data not recorded at Week 8 were provided which included a formal statistical 
analysis for the difference between the combination therapy and placebo in terms of the absolute 
difference at week 8 (rather than through week 8 as this takes the risk of masking deleterious effects 
over time).   
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Study 115 enrolled a total of 69 children with an eligible genotype and with a confirmed diagnosis of 
CF defined as sweat chloride value ≥60 mmol/l (homozygous F508del) or, if the sweat chloride was 
below 60 mmol/l (heterozygous F/RF subjects), the presence of chronic sino-pulmonary disease and/or 
gastrointestinal disease consistent with CF diagnosis was required. Enrolment was limited to patients 
with LCI2.5 result ≥7.5 at the Screening Visit, a body weigh≥ 15 kg, ppFEV1 ≥70 percentage points 
and the ability to swallow the tablets (given the dimensions of the higher-strength TEZ/IVA tablet 
which are 15.9 mm x 8.5 mm). This exclusion criterion may limit the conclusions on the acceptability 
of the study drug formulations. Patients with protocol-defined laboratory values indicative of clinically 
significant abnormal liver function were excluded (either (a) and two or more of ≥ 3 x ULN for AST, 
ALT, GGT, ALP, or total bilirubin ≥2 × ULN; (b) ≥ 5 x ULN ALT or AST; (c) GFR ≤45 mL/min/1.73 m2 
calculated by the Counahan-Barratee equation; or (3) hemoglobin <10 g/dL). Given that moderate 
transaminase increases are frequent in children with CF this exclusion criterion seems unnecessarily 
restrictive and limits the generalisation of the study results in terms of safety (in particular liver 
safety).  
Out of the 69 patients enrolled, 67 integrated the Full Analysis Set (FAS), the primary population for all 
efficacy analyses. Most patients were female (n=37, 55.2%) and White (n=64, 95.5%). The mean 
(SD) age at screening was 8.6 (1.7) years.  
In total, 52 (77.6%) subjects had the F/F genotype and 15 (22.4%) subjects had F/RF genotypes. The 
TEZ/IVA group included 42 patients with an F/F mutation and 12 with an F/RF mutation. All subjects in 
the placebo group were homozygous for F508del and 3 subjects with an F/RF genotype were enrolled 
in the IVA group. Only patients with a Symkevi approved RF mutation were enrolled.  
The mean (SD) LCI2.5 was 9.54 (1.97) (normal value: <7.5) and mean (SD) ppFEV1 87.1 (12.2) 
percentage points.  
Most subjects (n=64, 95.5%) weighed <40 kg at baseline. The BMI-, weight-, and height-for age z-
scores were all close to 0 and within ±2SD of the population of reference indicative of normal growth 
which is not unexpected in this age group. The majority of subjects (79.1%) were negative for 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the 2 years before study start. All homozygous F508del subjects had 
exocrine pancreatic insufficiency while all F/RF subjects pancreatic sufficient. 
Overall, the patient demographics appeared to be balanced for age, weight, height, LCI2.5 and ppFEV1. 
The overall disease and baseline characteristics are considered representative for the proposed target 
population of homozygous F508del subjects and heterozygous F508del and a CFTR mutation of residual 
function.  
Results  
Primary efficacy endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint in study 115 was the TEZ/IVA within-group absolute change in LCI2.5 
from baseline through week 8 which was -0.51 (95% CI: -0.74 to -0.29; P <0.0001). As the upper 
bound of the 95% CI (-0.29) was below the pre-specified maximum placebo effect of -0.10, it is

concluded that the primary endpoint met the pre-defined criterion for success. A larger effect was seen 
in the heterozygous F/RF population of the TEZ/IVA group based on subgroup analyses which were 
consistent in both descriptive statistics analyses based on patients with non-missing data as well as in 
MMRM analysis using placebo-mean imputation data at week 8. The latter resulted in LS mean (95% 
CI) within-group changes in LCI2.5 at week 8 of -0.45 (-0.71, -0.18) in homozygous F508del patients 
and -1.20 (-1.64, -0.76) in heterozygous F/RF patients. The LS mean (95% CI) treatment difference of 
TEZ/IVA vs. placebo at week 8 was -0.59 (95% CI: -1.22, 0.05) and -0.57 (95% CI: -1.23, 0.09) 
when this analysis is restricted to the F/F population.   
All point estimates exceeded the predefined placebo effect of -0.10. In all additional analyses 
presented of within-group changes, the upper limit of the 95% CI interval was below the pre-specified 
threshold with the exception of the upper limit of the 95% CI of the TEZ/IVA within-group change 
through week 8 restricted to F/F subjects which was -0.07. Study 115 was not powered for between-
treatment comparisons vs. placebo. The LS mean change in LCI2.5 in the placebo group at week 8 was 
-0.01 (-0.59, 0.57) while in the TEZ/IVA group this was -0.60 (-0.84, -0.35).  
Overall, the size of the treatment effect appears small, particularly in homozygous F508del subjects 
which is not unexpected. However, there are limited data from trials using this endpoint and a MCID 
has not yet been defined. Effect sizes in studies have ranged from -1 to -2 depending on the type of 
intervention and the duration of treatment. Limited longitudinal data from the placebo group of 
interventional trials are available to define whether an intervention exceeds the intrinsic variability of 
the test. Nevertheless, this endpoint is considered sufficiently established for trials in CF patients 6 
through 11 years of age.  
It cannot be excluded that longer (than 8 weeks) treatment duration may have resulted in additional 
decreases in LCI2.5 values (reflecting improvement in ventilation inhomogeneity).  However, the 
pattern of decrease seen in the lumacaftor/ivacaftor studies suggests that the greatest change from 
baseline is seen in the first 4 weeks of treatment.  
In the supportive study 113B, LCI was included as an exploratory endpoint given that the main aim of 
the study was to evaluate the LCI device that had not been used in any prior trials conducted by the 
MAH.  
Thirty-five subjects participated in the LCI exploratory sub-study of study 113B but only 30 of them 
contributed at baseline with LCI2.5 data. The LS mean (95% CI) absolute change from baseline in LCI2.5 
through Week 24 was 0.09 (-0.32, 0.49). An initial slight deterioration (increase in the LCI2.5 score) 
was seen at week 4 which returned to the baseline value by the end of treatment at week 24. 
However, no strong conclusion can be made by the lack of placebo comparison and the small number 
of included patients. 
Secondary endpoints 
The primary efficacy outcome in study 115 was supported by the TEZ/IVA within-group change in 
sweat chloride. The LS mean absolute change from baseline at Week 8 in sweat chloride was -12.3 
mmol/L (95% CI: -15.3, -9.3) in the TEZ/IVA group which is comparable to the one observed in the 
older population, as shown by a LS mean (SE) in older patients of -9.9 (0.5) mmol/l. Reduction in 
sweat chloride was observed for both genotypes in the TEZ/IVA group of study 115. The mean 
reduction at week 8 was slightly higher in the F/F subgroup (-12.9 mmol/, 95% CI: (-16.0, -9.9) than 
in the F/RF subgroup (-10.9 mmol/l, 95%CI: -20.8, -0.9). In the context of prior demonstration of 
efficacy for a TEZ/IVA combination in F508del-CFTR homozygous F/F and heterozygous F/RF patients 
12 years and older, and considering PK support for comparable exposure to TEZ and IVA, in the 6 
through 11 years age group, the result on sweat chloride, although indicative of partial functional 
correction only, can be considered likely to predict a slowing of disease rate progression.  
Assessment report  
EMA/628136/2020

The reduction in sweat chloride is consistent with at least partial restoration of the biochemical defect 
and with the combined corrector/potentiator action of TEZ/IVA. As expected, no improvement in sweat 
chloride was observed in the placebo group as shown by a LS mean (SE) absolute change at week 8 of 
-0.9 (3.5) mmol/l (additional MMRM analysis of between-treatment differences requested by CHMP).  
The analysis of the change in the respiratory domain score of CFQ-R showed a numerical improvement 
from baseline in the TEZ/IVA treated group as shown by a LS mean (SE) within-group change from 
baseline through week 8 of 2.3 (1.2) points. The magnitude of this change was smaller compared to 
the older population which is not unexpected given that the school-age children enrolled in study 115 
were at a relatively early stage of disease, and therefore patient reported outcome would be relatively 
insensitive to detect a treatment benefit. In addition, the MAH claims that the results obtained in 
children are not directly comparable to that of adults and adolescents because of the lack of published 
data comparing the Child version of the CFQ-R questionnaire to the Adolescents and Adults version. 
The MAH was asked to provide a responder analysis, i.e., percentage of children who reached an 
increase ≥ 4 points after 24 weeks of treatment in study 113B or after 8 weeks of treatment in study 
115. In study 113B, this analysis showed that the percentage of F/RF and F/F patients in the TEZ/IVA 
group who reached the predefined improvement through Week 24 was 33.3% and 42.6% respectively. 
In the overall population of the TEZ/IVA group this percentage was 41.4%. In study 115, the 
percentage of subjects who reached a change ≥ 4 through week 8 in the overall population of the 
TEZ/IVA group was 38.9% while in the F/F subgroup this percentage was 35.7%.     
Other endpoints 
Treatment with TEZ/IVA resulted in a within-group mean absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline 
through week 8 of 2.8 percentage points (95% CI: 1.0, 4.6). The magnitude of this change in ppFEV1 
is lower than the change observed in the older population, i.e., 3.4 (0.3) percentage points 
(homozygous F508del subjects). This is not an unexpected finding, as in children lung function is often 
preserved leaving less room for improvement. Though, the observed improvement exceeds the annual 
rate of decline in both F/RF subjects (-0.80 percentage points) and F/F subjects (-1.32 percentage 
points) in children aged 6 to 12 years of age, supporting the efficacy of TEZ/IVA in this population. 
Improvements in ppFEV1 were observed in both genotypes (mean change of 2.6 and 3.7 percentage 
points for the homozygous and heterozygous subgroups respectively) with TEZ/IVA treatment in Study 
115. In study 113B, the LS mean (SE) change in ppFEV1 was smaller than in study 115, i.e., 0.9 (0.7) 
percentage points.  
During treatment with TEZ/IVA, weight, height, BMI, and the associated z-scores remained stable, 
without improvement in study 115, this can be partially explained by the short treatment duration and 
also because of the mean z-scores of the anthropometric parameters that were close to 0 at baseline 
and therefore indicative of normal growth. In study 113B where treatment duration was for 24 weeks 
there was no evidence either of a gain in weight-, height-, and BMI z-scores. As most of the population 
were homozygous F508del patients, the results can be considered mainly indicative for this population. 
In the pivotal study 106 in subjects with the same genotype similar results were seen, i.e., the mean 
within-group change in BMI after 24 weeks of treatment with TEZ/IVA was 0.18 kg/m2. An extra-
pulmonary effect in weight, height and BMI is therefore not (yet) established but it is acknowledged 
that this may be consistent with the stable and normal mean values for these parameters at baseline.  
In study 113B, faecal elastase-1 values were not collected. In study 115, in the TEZ/IVA group, 
baseline values of faecal elastse-1 (FE-1) and immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) differed between F/F 
subjects and F/RF subjects. All 40 F/F subjects with baseline data had FE-1 levels ≤200 µg/g, 
consistent with pancreatic insufficiency whereas all F/RF subjects had baseline FE-1 levels ≥500 µg/g, 
consistent with normal pancreatic function. No subject with a baseline FE-1 level ≤200 μg/g became 
pancreatic sufficient (i.e., had an FE-1 level >200 μg/g) after TEZ/IVA treatment.  
Assessment report  
EMA/628136/2020 
Page 88/117 
 
 
  
A comparison of the change from baseline in faecal elastase-1 and immunoreactive trypsinogen by 
baseline FE-1 values (≤200 μg/g vs. > 200 μg/g) observed in the studies of lumacaftor/ivacaftor and 
ivacaftor alone in children of the same age range was requested. In response, it has been clarified that 
the assays used to assess FE-1 were the same in study 115 and study 809-109 (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) 
but differed in case of IRT. The MAH stated that direct comparisons of these parameters across these 
studies are hampered by the differences in treatment duration (8 weeks in study 115 vs. 24 weeks in 
study 109), subject genotype, assay collection, and statistical methodology. Nevertheless, data were 
provided for study 109 (homozygous F508del children treated for 24 weeks with lumacaftor/ivacaftor) 
which showed similar results to those of study 115 in F/F patients. At the age of 6 years exocrine 
pancreatic insufficiency is usually well established in patients homozygous for F508del and therefore 
earlier treatment would be needed to modify the course of this CF complication. In the IVA program, 
FE-1 and IRT were evaluated in Study 770-110, which enrolled subjects 6 years of age and older with 
the R117H mutation; these data are not comparable to those in the TEZ/IVA program due to the 
different age range (including mostly adult subjects) and different genotype (usually associated to 
exocrine pancreatic sufficiency at least in young ages).   
Cross study comparison with LUM/IVA 
Symkevi is proposed for the homozygous F/F population which overlaps with the target population of 
Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor). Therefore, a cross-study comparison was made with the pivotal study 
VX14-809-109 which was the pivotal study leading to the approval of lumacaftor/ivacator in this 
paediatric age group. 
In this cross study comparison, TEZ/IVA showed smaller within-group effects in the LS mean (SE) 
change in sweat chloride compared to LUM/IVA, (i.e., -12.3 [1.5] vs. -20.0 [1.0] mmol/l and LCI2.5 
(i.e., -0.51 [0.11] vs. -1.01 [0.13]); both for the overall TEZ/IVA-treated population as well as for the 
subgroup of homozygous F508del subjects. However, TEZ/IVA showed a numerically larger effect on 
ppFEV1 (i.e., 2.8 [0.9] vs. 1.1 [0.8] percentage points). However, final conclusions cannot be made 
due to undoubted limitations of cross-study comparisons.  
Kalydeco in combination with Symkevi may fulfil an unmet medical need for patients homozygous for 
F508del who cannot tolerate Orkambi due to (e.g.) respiratory adverse events or cannot take it due to 
drug-drug interactions. However, once approved, the use will likely not be limited to these patients. 
Therefore, as both medicinal products are indicated for homozygous F508del children aged 6 to less 
than 12 years, the CHMP considered that the results observed in these children should be presented in 
section 5.1 of the SmPC of Symkevi so that prescribers are aware of the results fully acknowledging 
that study 115 was not powered for subgroup analysis. This may allow them to make informed 
decisions for individual patients taking into consideration the potential risks and benefits of Symkevi 
and Orkambi.   
2.7.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The current application is based on extrapolation of efficacy. The pivotal study 115 was a randomised, 
parallel designed study but effectively a single-arm trial investigating the TEZ/IVA within-group 
changes in CF patients harbouring an F/F or certain F/RF mutations in patients aged 6 to less than 12 
years. The study met its primary endpoint by showing a statistically significant improvement in LCI2.5 
from baseline through week 8, the pre-specified primary endpoint. The size of the effect is small but 
considered sufficient in the context of prior demonstration of efficacy for a TEZ/IVA combination in 
F508del-CFTR homozygous and heterozygous F/RF patients 12 years and older. In addition, supportive 
evidence of efficacy was shown in terms of ppFEV1 and sweat chloride. The result on sweat chloride, 
although indicative of partial functional correction only, can be considered likely to predict a slowing of 
Assessment report  
EMA/628136/2020 
Page 89/117 
 
 
  
rate of disease progression. Thus, the trial provided the evidence to support the partial extrapolation 
from the adult efficacy data to the paediatric population. 
Children enrolled in studies 113B and study 115 received a weight-based dosing regimen of TEZ 50 mg 
qd/IVA 75 mg q12h for those weighing less than 40 kg. After model-based simulations and analysis of 
systemic exposure, a shift in the body weight cut-off was proposed from 40 kg to 30 kg. As a 
consequence, no clinical data have been generated in the proposed studies in children weighing ≥30 kg 
to less than 40 kg who will receive according to current dosing recommendations TEZ 100 mg qd/IVA 
150 mg q12h. Additional PD/PK modelling showed that this dosing results in more similar systemic 
exposure to that of older patients. In addition, the reduction in sweat chloride observed in study 113B 
and study 115 is within the range of that observed in the adult study 106. The PK/PD relationships 
provided show similar response within the range of predicted TEZ and IVA AUC exposures with the 
proposed dosing regimen based on a cut-off body weight of 30 kg. 
Cross study comparisons between study 115 and study 109 (Orkambi) raised the concern that the 
treatment effect in terms of LCI2.5 and sweat chloride might be somewhat lower than those observed 
with lumacaftor/ivacaftor. Therefore, it is considered that the results of the subgroups (homozygous 
F508del patients and F/RF patients) should be reported in the SmPC of Symkevi, so that prescribers 
are aware of the results for each subpopulations and may make informed decisions for individual 
patients taking into consideration the potential risks and benefits of Symkevi and Orkambi.   
2.8.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Study 113B and 115 are the main datasets which support the safety of the combination of tezacaftor 
and ivacaftor for the treatment of children aged 6 to less than 12 years old. Upon request, an interim 
analysis of the open-label extension VX17-661-116 (study 116) has been provided after all subjects 
completed the week 48 Visit (data cutoff date: 18 December 2019).  
Study 116 is an ongoing open-label extension study for subjects who completed either of the parent 
studies (Study 113B or 115) to evaluate longer-term safety of TEZ/IVA treatment. Patients who 
permanently stopped treatment because of elevated transaminases were not allowed to participate. 
Those who temporarily stopped treatment due to elevated transaminase could participate after 4-week 
negative rechallenge.   
The study consisted of two parts, part A and part B. In part A, the patients received treatment for up 
to 96 weeks according to the same posology as applied in the parent studies. After completing part A, 
patients could be entered in part B. Part B was added following a recent amendment (data 8 Nov 
2019) to collect additional safety data according the new proposed posology using the 30 Kg weight 
cut off. As the interim analyses of study 116 was conducted before the implementation of the 
amendment, the safety data provided correspond to the posology used in the parent studies 113B and 
115.  
The study included a total of n=130 patients, while up to n=133 patients could be included.   
Safety data set  
The main data safety database set for TEZ/IVA treated children age 6-11yrs is defined by the parent 
studies i.e. study 113B (n=70) and study 115 (n=54) and consists of N=124 patients. Additional long-
term safety data is provided for n=130 patients who rolled over to the long-term safety study 116. The 
Cumulative TEZ/IVA Safety Set combines the exposure of TEZ/IVA in the parent studies and in study 
116 (n=137). 
Assessment report  
EMA/628136/2020 
Page 90/117 
 
 
  
The comparison with placebo is limited to the n=10 F/F patients that were treated for 8 weeks in study 
115. 
Patient exposure 
Table 32 summarizes the exposure to TEZ/IVA in Study 116 and cumulatively across the parent 
studies and Study 116. 
The median exposure in the parent studies, in study 116, and in the cumulative TEZ/IVA dataset was 
23.3 weeks (n=124), 68.1 weeks (n=130), and 75.9 weeks (n=137) respectively. In the cumulative 
TEZ/IVA dataset a total of n=129 patients had an exposure > 48 weeks, and n=37 had an exposure > 
96 weeks.

Adverse events 
On overview of the adverse events of the main safety data sets is provided in Table 33. For 
comparison, also the placebo arm of study 115 is included. 
The overall incidence of AE or treatment-related AE’s was generally comparable. However, the 
incidence of SAE’S was higher in study 116 (n=27; 20.8%) and in the cumulative TEZ/IVA dataset 
(n=31; 22.6%) compared to the parent studies 115 and 113b (n=6; 4.8%).

Notes: Analyses represent data as of the data cut of 18 December 2019. MedDRA Version 22.1 was used. When 
summarizing number of events, a subject with multiple events within a category is counted multiple times in that 
category. When summarizing number and percentage of subjects, a subject with multiple events within a category 
is counted only once in that category. The table was sorted in descending order of frequency by SOC and PT in the 
cumulative TEZ/IVA group.  
Possibly related AEs 
On overview of the related TEAE is provided in Table 35.  
• 
Parent studies 113 and 115 
In the parent studies, a total of n=29 (23.4%) reported a related TEAE. The most commonly reported 
TEAE’s by preferred term were alanine aminotransferase increased (ALT) (n=4; 3.2%), headache 
(n=4; 3.2%), and infective pulmonary exacerbation of CF (n=3, 2.4%) 
•  Open-label extension study 116 
In the long-term safety study, the most frequently reported related TEAE by preferred term was 
aspartate amino transferase (AST) increased (n=6; 4.6%), ALT increased (n=5; 3.8%) and abdominal 
pain (n=5; 3.8%) 
•  Cumulative TEZ/IVA safety set 
In the cumulative treatment group, the most frequently related TEAE events were ALT increased (n=9, 
6.6%), AST increased (n=7, 5.1%) and headache (n=8; 5.8%).  
For comparison, a total of n=1 (10%) of the placebo-treated patients in study 115 reported a possible 
related AEs.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
An overview of SAEs is provided in Table 36. No deaths were reported. 
• 
Parent studies 113 and 115  
In the parent studies, a total of n=6 (4.8%) subjects had SAEs, but none of the SAEs were related to 
study drug. 
The reported Serious AE’s were infective pulmonary exacerbations of CF (n=2 (1.6%), breath odour 
(n=1, 0.8%), constipation (n=1, 0.8%), failure to thrive (n=1, 0.8%) sinusitis (n=1, 0.8%) and 
snoring (n=1, 0.8%). 
•  Open-label extension study 116

In study 116, a total of n=27 (20.8%) had a SAE. SAE’s that occurred in ≥ 2 subjects were infective 
PX of CF (n=15), abdominal pain (n= 2) and bacterial test positive (n=2). 
A total of 2 SAE were considered related or possibly related to TEZ/IVA, i.e. abdominal pain with 
increased AST, ALT, LDH and GGT and infective Px of CF.  
No SAE led to treatment discontinuation but a total of 5 SAEs led to treatment interruption. These SAE 
were resolved and patients resumed dosing with TEZ/IVA.  
The exposure-adjusted event rate for SAEs was higher in Study 116 (33.76 events per 100PY) than in 
the parent studies TEZ/IVA groups (17.27 events per 100PY).

Laboratory findings 
Liver function tests, lipid panels, vitamin levels, chemistry, haematology and coagulation were 
collected at regular intervals in the clinical studies.  
•  Liver function tests 
The mean values for LFT parameters were generally within normal ranges at all visits during the 
Treatment Period during study 113 and 115.  
A summary of treatment-emergent elevated transaminases events is provided in Table 37.  
• 
Parent studies 113 and 115 
A total of n=7 patients had elevated transaminases in the parent studies. All the AEs associated with 
elevated transaminases were mild in severity and none of them were serious or led to discontinuation 
of study drug.  
Among the 7 subjects with TEAEs of elevated transaminases, the median (range) time-to-onset of the 
first AESI was 57 (1 to 120) days 
For comparison, one patient in the placebo group of study 115 had an AE associated with elevated 
transaminases.  
•  Open-label extension study 116 
In study 116, a total of n=10 (7.7%) had at least an event of transaminase increase, 3 of which were 
considered severe in intensity.   
Assessment report

Two (1.5%) subjects had AEs related to transaminase elevation which led to treatment discontinuation. 
Both subjects had experienced elevated transaminases prior to TEZ/IVA dosing in the parent study. In 
study 116, they both experienced nonserious increases of hepatic enzymes. They did not receive 
treatments for these events. It should be clarified if these elevations normalise over time.   
An additional subject in study 116 had SAEs related to increases in hepatic enzymes which led to 
treatment interruption. The SAEs resolved and TEZ/IVA was resumed. 
Among the 10 subjects with AESIs of elevated transaminases, the median (range) time-to-onset of the 
first AESI was 209.5 (16 to 420) days.  
The exposure-adjusted event rate for elevated transaminase AEs was lower in study 116 than in the 
parent studies TEZ/IVA groups (12.89 versus 24.68 events per 100PY).

Table 38 provides the incidences of the subjects with maximum on treatment elevation (ALT or AST) 
above thresholds >1 x, >3 ×, >5 ×, and >8 × ULN.  
The incidence of ALT/AST > 1 to ≤ 3ULN was comparable between the parent studies (58.1%) and 
study 116 (52.3%) and the TEZ/IVA Cumulative safety set.    
In study 116, the incidence of ALT or AST >3 x ULN was n=12 (9%) compared with n=10 in the parent 
studies (8%).

•  Lipid panels/ vitamin level/ other serum chemistry parameters 
During the studies 113B, study 115 and study 116, serum lipid levels, vitamin levels, serum chemistry 
and haematology parameters were monitored. No clinically meaningful trends were observed. 
Ophthalmologic evaluations 
In study 113B, subjects had an Ophthalmologic Evaluation at baseline (Screening) and at Week 24. At 
Screening, 5 subjects had cataracts or lens opacities, which were all considered not clinically 
significant. Of these 5 subjects, 3 subjects had ophthalmologic evaluation at Week 24. Among these 3 
subjects, 1 subject continued to have cataracts at Week 24, and 2 subjects did not have cataracts 
detected at the Week 24 Ophthalmologic Evaluation. 
At Week 24, 2 subjects had non-cataract lens opacities that were not noted at Screening. In 1 subject, 
the finding was reported as a mild AE of slit-lamp test abnormal (non-cataract); in the other subject, 
the lens opacity (non-cataract) was not considered an AE. These 2 subjects had prior steroid use and 
the lens opacities were not considered clinically significant. 
In study 115, subjects had an ophthalmic evaluation at baseline (Screening), and no follow-up exam at 
Week 8, according to the protocol. 
In study 116, 4 subjects had cataract AEs: 3 had AEs of cataract and 1 had an AE of lenticular 
opacities. All four AEs were considered non-serious, mild or moderate in severity, and did not lead to 
change in study drug dosing.  
Cataracts/lens opacities are not included in section 4.8 of the SmPC of Kalydeco given that a clear 
relationship with the study medication could not be established. However, the need for 
ophthalmological examinations is included in section 4.4 of the SmPC.    
Electrocardiogram  
Prolongation of the QTc interval (i.e., QTcF >450 msec for males or QTcF >470 msec for females) was 
not reported in Studies 113 and 115. Similarly, no subject had a maximum QTcF change >60 msec.

Safety in special populations 
The proposed posology has not been fully assessed in study 115 or in study 113B, i.e., in both studies 
weight cutoff-based dosing was used with a weight cutoff of 40 kg. Upon review of the exposure data 
from these studies, an integrated analysis of data was performed. Following review of available data, a 
30 kg weight cut-off is proposed for CF patients 6 through 11 years of age in order to have the best 
matched TEZ and IVA exposures to the exposures in subjects 12 years and older. 
For children aged 6-11 years and weighing less than 30 kg who will receive the (lower) TEZ 50 mg 
qd/IVA 75 mg q12h dose, TEZ and IVA systemic exposure are predicted to be at the lower end of the 
systemic exposure seen in older patients, while M1-TEZ systemic exposure is predicted to be similar to 
that of older subjects. At the adult dose of TEZ 100 mg qd/IVA 150 mg q12h for children weighing ≥ 
30 kg, the exposure to TEZ-M1 is predicted to be increased with respect to that of older patients.  
Therefore, no safety have been generated in study 113B, study 115, or study 116 at the time of the 
interim analysis in children weighing ≥30 kg to less than 40 kg at the proposed adult dose of TEZ 100 
mg qd/IVA 150 mg q12h.   
To further support the proposed dosing regimen, the following safety data were also reviewed: 
1.  Bodyweight: Safety data from patients 12 to <18 years old who weighed ≤40 kg in Phase 
3 studies of TEZ/IVA and received the approved dose of TEZ/IVA (TEZ 100 mg qd/IVA 150 mg 
q12h), which is the same dose patients ≥30 kg will receive with the proposed dosing regimen. 
2.  Exposure: Safety data for subjects from Study 106 and Studies 113B and 115 who had M1-TEZ 
exposure ≥95th percentile of M1-TEZ exposures in Study 106 (Section 4.2). 
Safety data in subjects 12 to <18 years old who weighed ≤40 kg 
The safety data of the placebo-controlled integrated summary of safety (Studies 106, 107 and 108) 
were pooled for this analysis. A total of 199 patients aged 12 to less than 18 years were included. 
The post hoc analysis included a total of n=30 adolescent patients with a body weight < 40 Kg, i.e., 13 
placebo-treated patients and 17 TEZ/IVA-treated patients (Table 39).

Table made by assessor  
Safety data based on M1-TEZ exposure ≥ 95% percentile 
With the proposed body weight cut off of 30 kg, M1-TEZ exposures are predicted to be (also) in the 
higher range of clinical experience in subjects 12 years and older. Therefore, the safety of TEZ/IVA was 
reviewed for subjects with M1-TEZ exposures ≥95th percentile of M1-TEZ exposures in the pivotal 
study 106 (adult and adolescents homozygous for F508del). 
• 
In Study 106, there were 10 subjects with M1-TEZ exposures ≥95th percentile who had AEs. 
Of the 10 subjects, 3 had SAEs (2 subjects with SAEs of infective PEx of CF and 1 subject with 
an SAE of musculoskeletal chest pain; both assessed not related to study drug), none had 
Grade 3/4 AEs, or AEs leading to treatment discontinuation or interruption. The AEs profile of 
these 10 subjects was generally consistent with the overall population of Study 106. 
Assessment report  
EMA/628136/2020 
Page 100/117 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
• 
In Studies 113 and 115, there were 4 subjects (3 in Study 113B and 1 subject in Study 115) 
who had M1-TEZ exposures ≥95th percentile of M1-TEZ exposures in study 106. None of these 
subjects had SAEs, Grade 3/4 AEs, or AEs leading to treatment discontinuation or interruption. 
The AEs profile of these 4 subjects was generally consistent with the overall population of 
Studies 113 and 115. 
Time and dose dependency of observed liver function test abnormalities in the parent studies 
Transaminase elevations in study 113B and study 115 were analysed by each subject’s total active TEZ 
(TEZ+M1-TEZ) exposure or M1-TEZ exposure, as compared to the exposure quartiles and 95th 
percentile for study 106 (the pivotal Phase 3 study in F/F subjects ≥12 years of age).  
Of the 10 subjects with ALT or AST >3 × ULN in the parent studies, 8 had TEZ and M1-TEZ exposure 
below the study 106 median. There were 3 subjects with AST or ALT elevations >5 × ULN; all had total 
active TEZ and M1-TEZ exposures below the study 106 median. No trend towards increased liver 
function test (LFT) elevations was observed in subjects with higher total active TEZ or M1-TEZ 
exposures.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Dose adjustment is recommended for children aged 6 to less than 12 years of age receiving 
concomitant treatment with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors that is expected to match the 
systemic exposure of patients not receiving these drugs. Safety data in these patients have not been 
generated in study 113B or study 115 given that the use of known inducers and inhibitors of CYP3A 
was restricted in both studies.   
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
• 
Parent studies 113 and 115 
One patient in study 113B prematurely left the trial because of constipation. The constipation was not 
likely to be related to treatment.  
•  Open-label extension study 116 
A total of n=2 (1.5%) of patients had AE of transaminase elevations that led to treatment 
discontinuation. The patients discontinued treatment because of nonserious transaminase elevations. 
Both subjects had elevated transaminases prior to dosing in the parent study.  
The exposure-adjusted event rate for AEs leading to TEZ/IVA discontinuation was similar between 
Study 116 (2.45 events per 100PY) and the parent studies (2.47 events per 100PY). 
Adverse events leading to interruption of the drug 
• 
Parent studies 113 and 115 
In study 113, a total of 4 subjects had AEs that led to treatment interruption. A total of n=2 patients 
had AEs that were considered related or possibly related to study drug (1 subject with an AE of blood 
creatinine phosphokinase increased and 1 subject with AEs of ALT, AST, ALP, and GGT increased). No 
related AE that led to treatment interruption was serious. All related AEs that led to interruption 
resolved without any treatment. 
No AE that led to treatment interruption occurred in ≥2 subjects. No treatment interruptions occurred 
in study 115.

• 
Long term safety 116 
In study 116, a total of n=8 (6.2) patients experience AE’s that leaded to treatment interruption. All 
treatment interruptions occurred by PT in n=1 patient. In n=1 patient the treatment was interrupted 
because of ALT increased. No AEs leading to interruption occurred in ≥2 subjects. 
The exposure-adjusted event rate for AEs that led to treatment interruption was lower in Study 116 
(9.21 events per 100 PY) than in the parent studies (19.74 events per 100PY).  
• 
TEZ/IVA Cumulative safety set 
In the cumulative safety database, a total of n=13 (9.5%) interrupted therapy. TEAEs that resulted in 
treatment interruption were reported by 2 patients and were ALT increased and blood CK increased. All 
other AEs were reported by single patients.  
Post marketing experience 
Post-marketing surveillance of 6- through 11-year-old patients taking TEZ/IVA with the proposed 
posology has been ongoing in the US since approval on 21 June 2019. Over 600 patients 6 through 11 
years of age have initiated treatment with TEZ/IVA in the US. The results of post-marketing 
surveillance are consistent with clinical studies and no new safety concerns have been identified.  
2.8.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The main data safety database set for TEZ/IVA treated children age 6-11yrs is defined by the parent 
studies i.e. study 113B (n=70) and study 115 (n=54) and consists of N=124 patients. Additional long-
term safety data is provided for n=130 patients who rolled over to the ongoing open-label extension 
study 116. The cumulative TEZ/IVA Safety Set combines the exposure of TEZ/IVA in the parent studies 
and in study 116 (n=137).  
The median exposure in the parent studies, in study 116, and in the cumulative TEZ/IVA dataset was 
23.3 weeks (n=124), 68.1 weeks (n=130), and 75.9 weeks (n=137) respectively. In the cumulative 
TEZ/IVA dataset a total of n=129 patients had an exposure > 48 weeks, and n=37 had an exposure > 
96 weeks.   
The additional safety data discussed in response to the Request for Supplementary Information which 
are based on 129 patients who have been exposed to TEZ/IVA for more than 48 weeks further support 
the present extension of indication. Nevertheless, some limitations have been identified. There is a lack 
of direct safety data in children dosed with IVA in combination with TEZ/IVA at the adult doses in the 
weight band from ≥ 30 kg to less than 40 kg.  
This will affect about 40% of the EU target population. As no safety data are available for the subset of 
children aged 6 to less than 12 years old, the safety assessment is extrapolated from indirect safety 
data from adolescents in the same weight band (≥30 to less than 40 kg) who were treated in the 
pivotal studies and in the extension study 110 with the adult doses of TEZ and IVA. In addition, 
comparative safety data vs. placebo is limited due to the small number of subjects enrolled in the 
placebo group of study 115 (n=10) who were treated for 8 weeks. Therefore, the safety dataset mainly 
consisted of data collected in an uncontrolled, open-label study period in which the contribution from 
the longer disease duration versus the longer drug exposure may be hard to distinguish.  
Overall the safety data set assessed showed that treatment with IVA in combination with TEZ/IVA is 
well tolerated, and the reported adverse events appear to be in line with the adult’s and older 
paediatric patients safety database. Most of the adverse events were of mild intensity. 
Assessment report  
EMA/628136/2020 
Page 102/117 
 
 
  
The exposure-adjusted event rate for serious adverse events (SAE) was higher in study 116 (33.76 
events per 100 patient years) and the TEZ/IVA cumulative safety set (n=31 [30.50 event/100 patient 
years]) than in the TEZ/IVA groups of parent studies (17.27 events per 100PY). The MAH state that 
this might be adjusted to the unusually low rate of SAE in the parent studies when comparing the data 
with the reported exposure adjusted SAE rate of 42.77 event per 100PY reported in the placebo group 
of study 809-109 that led to the approval of lumacaftor/ivacaftor in the same age group. The observed 
exposure adjusted event rate of study 116 remains below this rate (33.76 event/100 PY) vs 42.77 
events/100 PY.  
The number of treatments related adverse events appeared to be consistently reported in both the 
parent studies and the long-term safety study (23.8%). The treatment appeared to be well tolerated 
as the number of patients that discontinued over time was low (n=3, 2.2%). A total of n=2 patients 
discontinued because of non-serious elevations of transaminases in the long-term safety study. These 
patients had experienced elevated transaminases prior to being dosing with TEZ/IVA in the parent 
study.  
The most frequently reported AE related to medication was elevated transaminases (occurring in 10% 
of subjects in the cumulative treatment-emergent period [median exposure duration:  after 75.9 
weeks]), an incidence being higher than that observed in subjects 12 years of age and older (3.2%). 
These observations are consistent with published data that indicate that (moderate) transaminase 
elevations are more common in younger patients with CF than in older patients and are in line with the 
observed frequency in the placebo arm of study VX14-809-109 with a treatment duration of 24 weeks.   
As no safety data are available for a subset of children aged 6 to less than 12 years old due to the 
proposed shift in the body weight cut-off from 40 kg to 30 kg for dosing recommendations, the safety 
assessment needs to be based on indirect safety data from adolescents in the same weight band (≥30 
to less than 40 kg) who were treated in the pivotal studies and in the extension study 110 with the 
adult doses of TEZ and IVA. This approach is endorsed since from a pharmacokinetic point of view 
maturation processes that may affect systemic exposure are completed in children 6 to 11 years old. 
Other safety data have been discussed to justify that the expected higher M1-TEZ levels in these 
children are not associated to an increase of adverse events, in particular increased in liver functions 
tests. All these analyses have been conducted post-hoc and even though they are supportive of the 
lack of dose-response (safety) relationship, this conclusion is based on a limited number of subjects. 
Additional safety data at the proposed posology is being collected in part B of the ongoing open-label 
extension study 116.  
Transaminase elevations are listed as an adverse reaction in the SOC “Hepatobiliary disorders” of 
section 4.8 of the SmPC of Kalydeco tablets and granules. Recommendations for liver function test 
monitoring at initiation and periodically during treatment, with recommendations to discontinue or 
interrupt treatment in the presence of abnormal liver function tests are already included in section 4.4 
of the SmPC and are relevant for the use in combination with Symkevi in patients from 6 to less than 
12 years of age.  
Additional safety data post marketing will be needed to further characterise the safety profile in the 
patient population. In study 116B, additional safety data is being collected at the proposed posology 
for children aged 6 to less than 12 years. Patients who permanently discontinued treatment or 
temporarily stopped treatment because of elevated transaminases and had a positive rechallenge could 
not be included. In addition, a post-marketing study 117 is being conducted. However, collection of 
safety data in study 117 will be very limited as the study is not designed to collect adverse events. 
Therefore, it may probably not register the number of patients that discontinue or interrupt treatment 
because of modest transaminase elevations.

2.8.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, treatment with IVA in combination with TEZ/IVA in children 6 through 11 years of age with CF 
who are homozygous for F508del or heterozygous F508del/CFTR mutation with residual function was 
well tolerated. The safety outcomes were generally consistent with the background profile of IVA in 
combination with TEZ/IVA in older patients with CF. In line with previous applications in paediatric CF, 
more paediatric patients showed elevations in transaminases compared to adults.  
No clinical data have been provided to support the proposed weight-based posology which is predicted 
to result in a higher M1-TEZ exposure in children weighing ≥30 to less than 40 kg. Additional post-hoc 
analyses failed to show a correlation between exposure and elevated transaminases, however these 
additional analyses are hampered by the limited number of patients included.  
There is however a need for monitoring of liver function prior and during treatment. The current 
recommendations in place in the Kalydeco SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8 are adequate to monitor the 
hepatic function for the use in combination with Symkevi and remain unchanged.

2.11.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
The updates as a result of this procedure do not impact the readability of the package leaflet. 
Readability testing was previously conducted for the Kalydeco 150 mg film-coated tablets package 
leaflet and reviewed during the initial application, procedure EMEA/H/C/002494, and bridging 
conducted during the initial indication extension for Kalydeco tablets in a combination regimen with 
tezacaftor /ivacaftor, procedure EMEA/H/C/002494/II/0063/G. Updates made to the package leaflet 
are minimal, and the structure and guidance for caregivers remains aligned to the principles agreed on 
in previous procedures. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
This application corresponds to a new strength for Kalydeco (75 mg tablets) to be used for a new 
indication in younger patients in combination with Symkevi as follows: 
Kalydeco tablets are indicated in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor tablets for the 
treatment of adults, adolescents, and children aged 6 years and older with cystic fibrosis (CF) who are 
homozygous for the F508del mutation or who are heterozygous for the F508del mutation and have one 
of the following mutations in the CFTR gene: P67L, R117C, L206W, R352Q, A455E, D579G, 
711+3A→G, S945L, S977F, R1070W, D1152H, 2789+5G→A, 3272-26A→G, and 3849+10kbC→T. 
Cystic Fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disease with serious, chronically debilitating morbidities and 
high premature mortality, and at present, there is no cure. CF is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene 
that result in the absent or deficient function of the CFTR protein at the cell surface that regulates salt 
and water absorption and secretion. The failure to regulate chloride transport results in the 
accumulation of thick, sticky mucus in the bronchi of the lungs, loss of exocrine pancreatic function, 
impaired intestinal absorption, reproductive dysfunction, and elevated sweat chloride concentration. 
Lung disease is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in people with CF. At very young ages 
clinically apparent lung disease may be absent although lung structural changes may be already 
present and progressing.  
In children with CF, pancreatic insufficiency and poor nutritional status are the most significant clinical 
manifestations of the disease. Published studies have demonstrated benefits such as improved growth 
and nutrition through early intervention in children diagnosed following newborn screening. Other 
complications of the disease such as liver disease and cystic fibrosis-related diabetes occur more 
frequently in the paediatric population.  
Assessment report  
EMA/628136/2020 
Page 107/117 
 
 
  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Most CF therapies target the symptoms of the disease, such as nutritional supplements, antibiotics, 
and mucolytics. Instead, CFTR modulators target the mutated CFTR protein and improve its function 
and, as such, they could modify the progress of the disease which is expected to translate into 
prolonged survival. This would be the ultimate goal of the CFTR modulators.  
Two CFTR modulators are approved for the treatment of CF in the EU in children aged 6 years and 
older, Kalydeco (ivacaftor) and Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor). Symkevi is approved for adolescents 
and adults aged 12 years and older. Kaftrio is approved for adolescents and adult patients who are 
homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation and heterozygous F508del patients with a second CFTR 
mutation of minimal function. 
The current application applies for an extension of the indication for Kalydeco in combination use with 
Symkevi for the treatment of children aged ≥ 6 years with  CF who are homozygous for the F508del-
CFTR mutation as well for those who are heterozygous F508del and have certain other mutations of 
residual function in the second allele of the CFTR gene. 
Homozygous F508del subjects 
The claimed indication for Kalydeco in combination with Symkevi (TEZ/IVA) partly overlaps with the 
approved indication of Orkambi. However, the extension of the IVA in combination with TEZ/IVA 
indication to patients 6 through 11 years old would provide an alternative treatment option for these 
patients considering that Orkambi is not tolerated by a number of subjects due to adverse events (e.g. 
bronchoconstriction, liver function impairment). In addition, lumacaftor is a strong CYP3A inducer 
which may lead to unwanted drug-drug interactions with commonly prescribed medications, while 
tezacaftor/ivacaftor is less prone to cause clinically relevant drug-drug interactions.  
Heterozygous F508del/RF subjects 
The claimed indication may cover an unmet need for children aged 6 to less than 12 years of age with 
cystic fibrosis who are heterozygous F508del/CFTR mutation of residual function. This patient group 
represents about 9% of the CF population. These patients are characterised by slower disease 
progression than the homozygous F508del population, but they will eventually experience the clinical 
consequences of CF including a reduced lifespan. 
Proposed posology 
The proposed posology for Kalydeco in a combination regimen with Symkevi is:  
Age 
Morning (1 tablet) 
Evening (1 tablet) 
6 to <12 years weighing < 30 kg 
tezacaftor 50 mg/ivacaftor 75 mg 
ivacaftor 75 mg 
6 to <12 years weighing ≥ 30 kg 
tezacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 150 mg 
ivacaftor 150 mg 
≥ 12 years 
tezacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 150 mg 
ivacaftor 150 mg 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The pivotal efficacy study for the current application is study VX16-661-115 (study 115), and the 
safety study is study VX15-661-113, part B (study 113B). Study 115 was a randomised, double-blind, 
parallel-group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tezacaftor/ivacaftor in paediatric patients 
aged 6-11 years. Children homozygous for F508del and heterozygous F508del/CFTR-mutations of 
residual function were enrolled.

This application is based on extrapolation of efficacy considering the similarities in the genetic, 
molecular and pathophysiological aetiology of CF between adults and paediatric patients as outlined in 
the principles described in ICH E11 and the EMA reflection paper on the use of extrapolation for in the 
development of medicines for paediatrics.  
Additionally, the role of CFTR modulators such as ivacaftor (Kalydeco) and lumacaftor/ivacaftor 
(Orkambi) has been established in children aged 6-11 years in a comparative placebo-controlled phase 
III randomised trial.

*patients exposed to TEZ/IVA 
In study 115, paediatric patients had evidence of uneven ventilation due to small airways disease at 
screening (LCI2.5 ≥7.5) but could have preserved lung function (as shown by ppFEV1). This is 
characteristic of children in the age range from 6 to less than 12 years old.   
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary efficacy outcome of the pivotal study 115, i.e., the LS mean (SE) within-group change in 
LCI2.5 from baseline through Week 8 in the TEZ/IVA group was -0.51 (0.11) (95% CI: -0.74, -0.29; P 
<0.0001). As the upper bound of the 95% CI (-0.29) was below the pre-specified maximum placebo 
effect of -0.10 (based on the 1-sided 90% lower bound of the within-group change of the placebo arm 
of study 109 in the clinical programme of Orkambi in children aged 6 to less than 12 years), it is 
concluded that the primary endpoint met the pre-defined criterion for success.

The additional sensitivity analyses for LCI2.5 (MMRM with placebo mean imputation) showed the 
following outcomes in LCI2.5 from baseline through week 8, i.e., the within-group LS mean absolute 
change was -0.32 (95% CI -0.56, -0.07) for homozygous F508del children; for the heterozygous 
population these figures were -1.07 (-1.49, -0.64). The upper bound of the 95% CI interval exceeded 
the pre-defined maximum placebo effect of -0.10 only in the analysis of homozygous F508del subjects 
(-0.07). In all other analyses presented (included the between-treatment difference vs. placebo) the 
point estimates exceed the predefined placebo effect and the upper limit of the 95% CI was below the 
predefined placebo effect (IVA/TEZ within-group comparisons).  
The key secondary outcomes and other outcomes (ppFEV1) showed favourable TEZ/IVA within-group 
changes from baseline trough/at week 8 as well:  
- Sweat chloride: LS mean (SE) -12.3 (1.5) (95% CI: -15.3,-9.3) mmol/l, p<0.0001.. 
- Respiratory domain of CFQ-R: LS mean (SE) 2.3 (1.2) (95% CI: -0.1, 4.6) points, p=0.0546. 
- Percent predicted FEV1 (ppFEV1): LS mean (SE) 2.8 (0.9) (95% CI: 1.0, 4.6) percentage points, 
p=0.0024. 
The reduction in sweat chloride, albeit of limited magnitude, is in the range of that observed in the 
adult trials. Improvements in primary and secondary outcome measures were observed in both 
subgroups of subjects enrolled in the study, i.e., homozygous F508del and heterozygous 
F508del/mutation of residual function.  
In the supportive study 113B an improvement in mean sweat chloride and in the mean score of the 
respiratory domain of the CFQ-R was observed. 
The drug was well tolerated by most of the patients.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Dosing recommendations in the pivotal study 115 were based on pop PK model-based simulations and 
analysis of systemic exposure which included PK data from study 113. The aim of the paediatric 
development programme was to match in children aged 6 to 11 years TEZ and IVA systemic exposures 
which have been shown to be efficacious and safe in patients aged 12 years and older. Based on 
various pop-PK analyses, model-based simulations led to the choice of a body weight cut off of 30 kg, 
i.e., children aged 6 to less than 12 years and weighing less than 30 kg will receive TEZ 50 mg qd/ IVA 
75 mg every 12 hours while those weighing ≥ 30 kg will receive the adult dose of TEZ 100 mg qd/ IVA 
150 mg every 12 hours. While it may be agreed that based on the modelling and simulations provided, 
the cut-off of 30 kg likely represents the best choice to match the systemic exposure of adult and 
adolescents subjects, overall the simulations showed that for children below 30 kg, TEZ and IVA 
systemic exposure were at the lower end of the systemic exposure in older patients, while for children 
weighing ≥ 30 kg higher M1-TEZ levels were predicted. These raised concerns in terms of efficacy and 
safety. Upon request by CHMP, additional pop-PK and pop PK/PD modelling and simulation were 
provided and confirmed, that only M1-TEZ exposure is predicted to be affected by the shift in the body 
weight cut-off at 100 mg TEZ qd, and that a similar response in terms of sweat chloride is to be 
expected irrespective of the predicted TEZ, IVA, and M1-TEZ exposures in children weighing ≥ 30 kg to 
less than 40 kg as well as in children weighing less than 30 kg when dosed according to the above 
proposed posology.   
Although study 115 is a randomised, double-blind, parallel study, within-group group changes in the 
TEZ/IVA arm were predefined as the primary analysis for all continuous variables. No between-
treatment differences were planned in the statistical analysis plan. Consequently, a formal statistical 
Assessment report  
EMA/628136/2020 
Page 110/117 
 
 
  
analysis for the difference from baseline at week 8 between the TEZ/IVA and the placebo groups was 
requested for LCI2.5, LCI5.0 and sweat chloride using placebo-mean imputation data for subjects with 
missing data at week 8. The LS mean difference (SE) vs. placebo in LCI2.5 was -0.59 (95% CI: -1.22, 
0.05).  
Overall, the size of the treatment effect appears small, particularly in homozygous F508del subjects. 
However, there are limited data from trials using this endpoint and a MCID has not yet been defined. 
Effect sizes in studies have ranged from -1 to -2 depending on the type of intervention and the 
duration of treatment. Limited longitudinal data from the placebo group of interventional trials are 
available to define whether an intervention exceeds the intrinsic variability of the test. Nevertheless, 
this endpoint is considered sufficiently established for trials in CF patients 6 – 11 years of age.  
Treatment duration of study 115 is relatively short (8 weeks). It cannot be excluded that longer (than 
8 weeks) treatment duration may have resulted in an additional decrease in the LCI2.5 value (reflecting 
improvement in ventilation inhomogeneity).  However, the pattern of decrease seen in the 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor study 109 suggests that the greatest change from baseline is seen in the first 4 
weeks of treatment. This is also the case for endpoints such as sweat chloride and ppFEV1 for which an 
effect under CFTR modulator therapy is usually observed quite early and maintained for 24 weeks.  
In the supportive study 113B, LCI was included as an exploratory endpoint given that the main aim of 
the study in this respect was to evaluate the LCI device that had not been used in any prior trials 
conducted by the MAH. Children show initially a small, clinically irrelevant deterioration of LCI2.5. At the 
end of the study, the LCI2.5 has returned to the baseline value. The LS mean absolute change in LCI2.5 
from baseline through Week 24 was 0.09 (95% CI: -0.32, 0.49).  
Cross-study comparisons with study 109 show a smaller effect of TEZ/IVA in terms of sweat chloride 
and LCI2.5 when compared with LUM/IVA as shown by within-group LS mean (SE) absolute change in 
sweat chloride of -12.3 (1.5) vs. -20.0 (1.0) mmol/l and in LCI2.5 of -0.51 (0.11) vs. -1.01 (0.13). 
However, TEZ/IVA showed a numerically larger effect on ppFEV1 as shown by a mean (SE) within-
group change of 2.8 (0.9) vs. a mean (SE) within-group change of 1.1 (0.8) percentage points in the 
LUM/IVA arm of study 109.  
The study drugs appeared to be well accepted, but patients were selected based on their ability to 
swallow the tablet. This may have biased the results of the acceptability testing towards a more 
favourable outcome.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The main safety data set included 137 patients, among them 129 patients who have been exposed for 
more than 48 weeks. Most frequently reported adverse events were cough (58.4%), followed by 
infective pulmonary exacerbation of CF (43.8%), and pyrexia (24.1%).  
The most frequently treatment-related reported adverse events were transaminase elevations. The 
observed incidence of ALT and AST elevations appeared to be higher (7.7%) in this paediatric age 
group than in subjects 12 years of age and older (3.2%).  
A higher incidence of serious adverse events per 100 patient-years was reported in the open-label 
extension study 116 (n=27, 20.8%) compared with the parent studies (n=6, 4.8%).  
A total of 8 patients interrupted treatment due to adverse events which include two who had 
transaminase elevations. A total of 3 patients (2.2%) discontinued treatment, two of them due to 
because of nonserious transaminase elevations.

3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The safety dataset mainly consists of data collected in an uncontrolled study period in which the 
contribution from the longer disease duration versus the longer drug exposure may be hard to 
distinguish. Comparative safety data vs. placebo is limited due to the small number of subjects 
enrolled in the placebo group of study 115 (n=10) who were treated for 8 weeks.  
In addition, as no safety data are available for a subset of children aged 6 to less than 12 years old, 
the safety assessment needs to be based on indirect safety data such as that of adolescents in the 
same weight band (≥30 to less than 40 kg) who were treated in the pivotal studies and in the 
extension study 110 with the adult doses of TEZ and IVA. This and other post-hoc safety analyses 
failed to show a correlation between increased exposure and elevated transaminases, but this 
conclusion is based on a limited number of patients.  
Cross study comparisons with the placebo arm of study 809-109 in the same F/F target population 
show that the incidence of transaminase elevations ~10% and SAE’s is comparable as the one 
observed in the current study.  
The applied posology will result in a higher exposure in patients weighting between 30- 40 kg. No 
clinical data for the proposed posology for patients weighing 30-40 kg is available. This lack of data 
affects about 40% of the EU target population. 
Transaminase elevations were already included as adverse reactions in section 4.8 of the SmPC of 
Kalydeco and section 4.4 includes recommendations for liver function test monitoring at initiation and 
periodically during treatment, with recommendations to discontinue or interrupt treatment in the 
presence of significantly abnormal liver function tests.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Ivacaftor and tezacaftor are CFTR modulators targeting the defect of the mutated CFTR protein which 
is the basis of the pathophysiological features in CF. This dysfunction of the CFTR protein has the same 
underlying genetic and molecular aetiology across age groups and there is no age-dependency in the 
mechanism of action of the drugs considered either. In addition, the pathogenesis of the disease is also 
comparable across paediatric and adult populations although there may be a significant age-

dependency for the presence of certain symptoms and signs of the disease with younger children 
generally less affected than older patients or with a different pattern of organ damage. These 
similarities in disease justify the use of an approach based on extrapolation to establish the efficacy of 
TEZ/IVA in paediatric patients with CF. Paediatric studies investigating the PK and safety of the drug 
are considered an acceptable way to establish the role of CFTR modulators for the treatment of 
children with CF.   
The efficacy of ivacaftor in a combination regimen with Symkevi has been established in phase 3 
studies in patients aged 12 years and older by showing improvement in lung function using FEV1, 
sweat chloride and quality of life compared to placebo. This led to the EU approval of Symkevi for CF 
patients homozygous for F508del/F508del and heterozygous for F508del/certain CFTR mutations of 
residual function. Bridging the efficacy from older patients (source population) to children aged 6 to 
less than 12 years of age is based on matching the systemic exposure which has been shown 
efficacious and safe in the source population. 
In order to support this paediatric indication, PK data was collected in children aged 6 to less than 12 
years. Based on the data submitted to support this application, it appeared that for children weighing 
≥30 to less than 40 kg, TEZ parent and IVA parent systemic exposures fell within the lower range of 
observed exposures in subjects 12 years and older. Therefore, the weight cut-off for dosing 
recommendations was shifted from 40 kg to 30 kg to better match the exposure of older patients. This 
adjustment affects about 40% of the target EU population. The clinical package does not contain 
clinical data to provide evidence for this posology in children weighing at least 30 kg to less than 40 
kg. However, this was accepted by CHMP since the additional data provided sufficiently support the 
proposed posology.  
A pharmacodynamic effect was shown in the paediatric studies 113B and 115, i.e., a reduction in 
sweat chloride of 12 mmol/l was shown in the TEZ/IVA group of study 115 (and also in the additional 
analysis vs. placebo) that was similar to the effect observed in older patients.  
Based on the similar systemic exposure and pharmacodynamic effect in both populations, extrapolation 
of efficacy in the approved indication in patients aged 12 years and older to the children aged 6 to 11 
years old (inclusive) is considered acceptable.  
The pivotal study 115 met its primary endpoint according to the pre-defined statistical analysis. The 
result was highly statistically significant but of small magnitude, in particular for homozygous F508del 
children. For the heterozygous population, the within-group LS mean absolute change was -1.07 (as 
compared to -0.32 in F/F patients). Nevertheless, this is considered sufficient in the context of prior 
demonstration of efficacy for a TEZ/IVA combination in F/F and F/RF patients aged 12 years and older. 
In addition, supportive evidence of efficacy was also shown in terms of ppFEV1 (with a mean within-
group change of 2.8 percentage points) and sweat chloride. The result on sweat chloride, although 
indicative of partial functional correction only, can be considered likely to predict a slowing of rate of 
disease progression.  
In cross-study comparisons of study 115 with study 109 (pivotal study for the approval of 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor in children aged 6 to less than 12 years homozygous for F508del), the effect of 
TEZ/IVA lag behind that of LUM/IVA in terms of LCI2.5 and sweat chloride. Given that once approved in 
children aged 6 to less than 12 years of age both will be available for homozygous F508del subjects, it 
is considered that the SmPC of Symkevi should include in section 5.1 the results of study 115 for both 
F/F and F/RF subjects to allow healthcare professionals to take informed decisions about treating 
individual F/F patients with Orkambi or with Symkevi even acknowledging that study 115 was not 
powered for subgroup analysis. If approved, Symkevi will provide an alternative for homozygous 
F508del patients who cannot tolerate Orkambi because of respiratory side effects or because of certain 
drug-drug interactions. Symkevi will be the first CFTR modulator for children who are heterozygous

F/certain CFTR mutations of residual function. These patients are characterised by slower disease 
progression, but they will eventually experience the clinical consequences of CF including a reduced 
lifespan. 
In the clinical program, IVA in combination with TEZ/IVA appeared to be well-tolerated, both after 
short and longer term treatment. The most frequently reported related adverse event was 
transaminase elevation. However, the safety data base mainly consists of uncontrolled data, which 
makes it hard to distinguish the contribution from the longer disease duration versus the longer drug 
exposure as a comparison with placebo is lacking. Cross study comparisons showed that the observed 
frequency of elevated transaminase (~ 10%) of the long-term safety data base of 75-week duration 
was in line with the placebo arm of a comparative trial of 24-week duration (study 109 in the Orkambi 
programme).   
Transaminase elevations are already included as adverse reactions in section 4.8 of the SmPC of 
Kalydeco and section 4.4 includes recommendations for monitoring of liver function at initiation and 
periodically during treatment, with recommendations to discontinue or interrupt treatment in the 
presence of significantly abnormal liver function tests. No additional information is needed to mitigate 
the risk of hepatotoxicity when Kalydeco will be used in combination with Symkevi in patients from 6 
to 11 years of age.  
No clinical data has been provided to support the safety for the higher proposed posology which may 
affect about 40% of the proposed EU target population. Concerns were raised, if the higher (M1-TEZ) 
exposure would increase the risk of transaminase elevations. Various post hoc analyses were 
conducted but failed to show such a correlation. Although these analyses included a limited number of 
patients, together with the long-term safety data base they provide enough support to the proposed 
posology.  
The CHMP recommended the MAH to submit an application for the 75 mg granules formulation to allow 
its use in combination with Symkevi for patients not able to swallow tablets. This was not agreed by 
the MAH.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
In the paediatric studies 113B and 115, IVA in combination with TEZ/IVA showed a similar 
improvement in sweat chloride in children with CF as compared to older patients. The observed 
pharmacodynamic improvement was associated with an improvement in LCI2.5 of limited magnitude in 
particular in children homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation but still sufficient in the context of 
prior demonstration of efficacy for a TEZ/IVA combination in F/F and F/RF patients aged 12 years and 
older. The treatment appeared overall well tolerated.  
From the PK point of view, the posology investigated in studies 113B and study 115 resulted in TEZ 
and IVA exposures at the lower end of that seen in older patients. Therefore, the MAH proposed to 
shift the body weight cut-off for dosing from 40 kg to 30 kg, i.e., children weighing ≥30 kg will be 
treated with the adult dose of TEZ 100mg qd/IVA 150 mg q12h which is expected to result in a more 
comparable systemic exposure. This proposed posology which has not been tested in the paediatric 
clinical studies (i.e., in children weighing at least 30 kg to less than 40 kg) is supported with additional 
PK/PD analyses as well as with longer-term safety data and post-hoc analyses that contribute to 
alleviate the concerns regarding the potential for increased systemic exposure and risk of transaminase 
elevations. In section 5.2 of the Kalydeco tablets SmPC, a footnote in table 9 showing the ivacaftor 
systemic exposure when combined with tezacaftor/ivacaftor, indicates that exposures in children aged 
6 to less than 12 years and weighing ≥30 kg to <40 kg are predictions derived from the population PK 
model.

Overall, the data support the extension of the indication to children aged 6 years and older and the 
approval of the new 75 mg strength of Kalydeco tablets. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Kalydeco is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Kalydeco is not similar to Bronchitol, TOBI Podhaler, 
Symkevi and Kaftrio within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See 
appendix 1. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of, Kalydeco 75 mg is favourable in the following indication: 
Kalydeco tablets are indicated in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor tablets for the 
treatment of adults, adolescents, and children aged 6 years and older with cystic fibrosis (CF) who are 
homozygous for the F508del mutation or who are heterozygous for the F508del mutation and have one 
of the following mutations in the CFTR gene: P67L, R117C, L206W, R352Q, A455E, D579G, 
711+3A→G, S945L, S977F, R1070W, D1152H, 2789+5G→A, 3272 26A→G, and 3849+10kbC→T. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension of the marketing authorisation for Kalydeco subject to 
the following conditions:

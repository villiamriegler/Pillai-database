2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL) 
Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a progressive hematologic disease characterized by an 
accumulation of monoclonal mature B cells in the blood, bone marrow, and secondary lymph organs, and 
diagnosis requires the presence of ≥ 5000 B-lymphocytes/µL in the peripheral blood for the duration of at 
least 3 months. It is the most common form of adult leukaemia in the Western world, with an incidence 
of 4 per 100,000 persons per year. The median age of diagnosis in the EU is 72 years and only 10% of 
patients are less than 55 years old. The current WHO classification system recognizes and groups CLL and 
small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) as the same biological entity, with CLL clinically manifesting primarily 
in bone marrow and peripheral blood, and SLL primarily manifesting in the lymph nodes.  
Current treatments for CLL are not curative. Fewer patients obtain responses with each subsequent 
regimen, and subjects become increasingly resistant to available therapy. Patients who relapse after a 
disease-free period of over 1 year (2-3 years for chemoimmunotherapy) are considered treatment 
sensitive and may be candidates for treatment reinitiation. Patients who relapse after a shorter interval, 
or are refractory to first-line treatment, present a more challenging group, particularly those who are 
older, have comorbid conditions, and/or harbour high-risk cytogenic abnormalities. A retrospective 
analysis of patients in the German CLL8 trial found that overall survival after the start of salvage 
treatment among patients whose disease had progressed within 2 years after the end of 
chemoimmunotherapy was about 2 years, comparable to that of truly refractory patients. 
Patients with the del(17p) chromosomal abnormality represent a high risk group of CLL. According to the 
ESMO guidelines, there is no standard treatment for these patients, who have a median life expectancy of 
2–3 years from front-line treatment. While only a small minority of CLL patients will have detectable 
del(17p) at the time of diagnosis, the proportion increases with successive chemotherapy treatments, so 
that in the relapsed setting up to 30% to 50% of patients have del(17p). 
The monoclonal antibody ofatumumab, is currently approved in the EU in the treatment of CLL in the 
refractory setting as a single agent. The combination of the monoclonal antibody rituximab with 
chemotherapy (eg, fludarabine and cyclophosphamide) (FCR regimen) is approved in the EU for use in 
this setting. Marketing authorization for alemtuzumab, which had been indicated for the treatment of CLL 
in patients for whom fludarabine combination chemotherapy is not appropriate, was withdrawn in the EU 
in August 2012. 
Indolent Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (iNHL) 
Indolent Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (iNHL) comprises 4 clinical entities (follicular lymphoma [FL], small 
lymphocytic lymphoma [SLL], lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma with or without Waldenström’s 
macroglobulinemia [LPL/WM], and marginal zone lymphoma [MZL]). The current WHO classification 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/511776/2014  
Page 9/132 
 
 
 
 
 
system recognizes and groups CLL and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) as the same biological entity 
(see above). 
While initial treatments for each of the indolent lymphomas may vary at the time of disease progression, 
next-line therapies largely comprises the same armamentarium of anti-CD20 antibodies and 
chemotherapies, but the clinical evidence supporting this approach is limited especially with respect to 
MZL and LPL/WM. In resistant and refractory stages the current treatment alternatives are very limited 
and often carry significant toxicities.  
About the product 
Idelalisib inhibits phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase p110δ (PI3Kδ), which is hyperactive in B cell malignancies 
and is central to multiple signalling pathways that drive proliferation, survival, homing, and retention of 
malignant cells in lymphoid tissues and bone marrow.  Idelalisib is a selective inhibitor of adenosine 
5’-triphosphate (ATP) binding to the catalytic domain of PI3Kδ, resulting in inhibition of the 
phosphorylation of the key lipid second messenger phosphatidylinositol and prevention of Akt (protein 
kinase B) phosphorylation (see SmPC, section 5.1). 
The applicant initially claimed the approval for the following indication: 
Idelalisib is indicated, alone or in combination, for the treatment of patients with relapsed chronic 
lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). 
Idelalisib is indicated for the treatment of patients with refractory indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma 
(iNHL). 
The final indication following CHMP review of this application is (see SmPC, section 4.1): 
Zydelig is indicated in combination with rituximab for the treatment of adult patients with chronic 
lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL): 
•  who have received at least one prior therapy, or 
•  as first line treatment in the presence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutation in patients unsuitable for 
chemo-immunotherapy. 
Zydelig is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) that 
is refractory to two prior lines of treatment. 
Treatment with Zydelig should be conducted by a physician experienced in the use of anticancer 
therapies. 
The recommended dose of Zydelig is 150 mg, taken orally, twice daily. Treatment should be continued 
until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Dose modifications are described in Table 63 
(Summary Table of Risk Minimization Measures) and the SmPC section 4.2.

In October 2013 the applicant submitted to the EMA a request for Accelerated Assessment for idelalisib, 
pursuant to Article 14 (9) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. During the CHMP meeting of November 2013, 
the request for accelerated assessment was accepted. 
In view of the Major Objections raised, and in order to allow adequate time for the assessment of the 
responses to the list of questions, the CHMP decided to revert the accelerated procedure to a normal 
timetable for review. 
• 
Scientific advice 
The applicant did not request CHMP scientific advice.

polymorphic forms (Form I and II) have been identified and both have equivalent stability and solubility. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/511776/2014  
Page 11/132 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The chemical structure elucidation has been performed by infrared spectroscopy, 1H NMR 
spectroscopy, 13C NMR, 19F NMR, mass spectroscopy, ultraviolet absorption (UV) and x-ray diffraction. 
The molecular formula is confirmed by elemental analysis.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is synthesised in five steps using commercially available and well defined starting 
materials. The final active substance is purified by crystallisation.  According to the synthetic process 
described the active substance is consistently obtained as the S-enantiomer. The manufacturing 
development of the active substance includes studies based on a Quality by Design (QbD) approach, in 
line with ICH Q8, Q9, Q10, Q11 and other regulatory guidance. However, no Design Space was proposed. 
The designation of the starting materials for the synthesis of the active substance has been justified with 
respect to their impurity profiles, their potential for carry-over into the final active substance, their 
structural complexity and with respect to their proximity to the final intermediate and the active 
substance, respectively.  
The information provided adequately describes the manufacturing including reactions conditions, 
quantities of raw materials and yields.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities is in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to 
their origins and adequately characterised. The carry-over of impurities, reagents, solvents and catalysts 
from the starting material into the final active substance has been discussed. The impurity profile of the 
active substance is practically identical for the different manufacturers. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediates, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The active substance is packaged in in double-lined polyethylene bags closed with plastic or wire ties. The 
bags are held in high density polyethylene drums or other suitable secondary containers with lids of 
appropriate size and fitted with a tamper-evident security seal. The materials in contact with the active 
substance comply with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identification (IR and HPLC), clarity of 
solution, assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), elemental impurities (ICP), particle 
size (laser light scattering) and melting point (Ph Eur). 
The control tests were carried out to comply with the specifications and test methods of the Ph. Eur. 
monograph. A detailed description and full method validation data was also provided for the in-house 
analytical methods in accordance with the relevant ICH Guidelines. The analytical methods proposed are 
suitable to control the quality of the active substance. The impurity limits are acceptable and there is no 
concern from the point of view of safety.  
Batch analysis data are provided on 13 production batches of the active substance. All the batches were 
manufactured according to the proposed synthetic route, and the batch analysis data show that the active 
ingredient can be manufactured reproducibly. All results are within the specifications and consistent from 
batch to batch.

Stability 
Six production scale batches of the active substance packed in the intended commercial packaging from 
the proposed manufacturers were put on stability testing as per ICH conditions: under long term 
(25°C/60%RH) for up 36 months and accelerated (40°C/75%RH) for up 6 months. The active substance 
used in the primary stability studies was manufactured according to the commercial process.  
The following parameters were tested: appearance, impurities (HPLC), chiral impurities (chiral HPLC), 
water content (Ph Eur), X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), melting point (Ph Eur), FTIR and microbiological 
quality (Ph Eur). The analytical methods used in the stability studies, which were not included in the 
specifications, have been adequately described and non-compendial methods) appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines.    
Stress studies were conducted by exposing the active substance to high and low temperatures and 
humidity. Photostability testing following ICH guidelines Q1B was performed on one batch of the active 
substance. The results showed that there are no significant changes for any of the evaluated parameters 
established for the stability studies. 
All stability studies results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The aim of the drug development was to develop an immediate release solid dosage formulation that 
could support patient adherence to the treatment.  
Idelalisib was first evaluated in Phase 1 clinical trials as a neat drug-in-capsule dosage form. A granulated 
powder-in-capsule  dosage  form  was  developed  as  a  replacement  for  the  neat  drug  presentation  and 
evaluated in Phase 2 clinical trials. The initial formulation composition was defined through development 
of the granulated powder presentation. A film-coated tablet formulation containing the same ingredients 
was prepared as an alternative to the granulated powder-in-capsule presentation and evaluated in Phase 
2 clinical trials and the subsequent Phase 3 clinical studies. The tablet formulation has the advantage of 
improving manufacturing efficiency and increasing active substance loading to allow for small tablets. 
During  the  pharmaceutical  development  the  applicant  took  into  account  the  properties  of  the  active 
substance.  All  the  excipients  selected  are  pharmacopeia  grade  and  controlled  according  with  their 
relevant monographs. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of 
excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The manufacturing process uses granulation and the development is adequately described and discussed 
in the documentation. In addition, the applicant discussed important aspects of the drug development 
such as the drug load, granulation, wet and dry milling, drying, blending and scale-up. During the drug 
development  it  was  noted  that  tablets  contain  a  mixture  of  both  Forms  I  and  II.  The  applicant  has 
provided  adequate  documentation  to  support  that  Form  II  is  biopharmaceutically,  chemically  and 
physically equivalent to Form I. 
The process development is described using design of experiments (DoE) without claiming design space. 
The applicant states that they intend to operate within the proposed normal operating ranges (NOR) and 
movement outside of the proposed normal operating ranges would be considered a change to the 
manufacturing process and would initiate a quality investigation and regulatory post approval change

process if required. PARs for the mixing, milling, blending, lubrication, and coating processes were 
established based on process screening experiments and clinical manufacturing experience. Optimisation 
was made based on a risk assessment from knowledge gained from the development history. The 
granulation, drying, and compression were identified as having the greatest influence over proposed 
Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs).  
The dissolution studies were performed in 0.1 M HCl as the solubility of the active substance is dependent 
on pH with superior solubility at low pH. The discriminatory power of the dissolution method has been 
demonstrated. The particle size distribution has been consistently observed to date in clinical and 
commercial active substances batches. The influence of particle size on the dissolution behaviour of the 
tablet has been discussed.  
Bioequivalence study was performed showing bioequivalence between the clinical formulations and the 
proposed commercial formulation. 
The primary packaging is described as stated in the SmPC. The material complies with Ph Eur and EC 
requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of nine main steps: mixing, granulation, milling, drying, drying 
milling, blending, compression, film-coating and packaging. The process is considered to be a standard 
manufacturing process. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing 
process and pharmaceutical form.   
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this type of dosage form: 
appearance, identification (HPLC and UV), water content (Ph Eur), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), 
uniformity of dosage Units (Ph Eur), dissolution (Ph Eur) and microbiological quality (Ph Eur). 
Batch analysis data of nine pilot scale batches of each strength of the finished product are provided. The 
results confirm the consistency of the process and its ability to manufacture a product complying with the 
product specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data of four production scale batches of finished product stored under long term conditions for 36 
months at 25 ºC / 60% RH  and at 30ºC / 75% RH  and for up to six months under accelerated conditions 
at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are 
identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for 
marketing. 
The parameters tested are appearance, assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), dissolution (Ph Eur), 
microbiological quality (Ph Eur), water content (Ph Eur), chiral purity (chiral HPLC). The analytical 
methods used during the stability studies are the same as used for release testing of the finished product

with the exception of chiral purity test. A description of this method was provided, validated and it was 
shown to be stability indicating. 
One batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug 
Substances and Products. In addition stress stability studies were performed on one fully representative 
batch under various extreme conditions of humidity, high and low temperature. One production scale 
batch packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing was stored for 60 days to -20°C, 5°C, 
60°C/ambient humidity, and 25°C/80% RH, open dish exposure with  25°C/60% RH and 30°C/75%RH. 
Based on the available stability data, the shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC are 
acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The main goal of the drug development was to develop an 
immediate release solid dosage formulation that could support patient adherence to the treatment. The 
development of the medicinal product includes elements of Quality by Design (QbD), but no design space 
has been established or claimed. The manufacturing flow-chart was provided with suitable in-process 
controls. The manufacturing process is adequately validated at full scale at the proposed manufacturing 
site and a validation protocol has been presented.  
The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
None. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The primary and secondary pharmacodynamics of idelalisib were investigated in a number of in vitro and 
in vivo studies.

Idelalisib was tested in rats, rabbits and dogs by oral gavage for the toxicology studies. In addition, safety 
pharmacology studies were carried out in rats and dogs (oral administration). Pivotal toxicology studies 
and most of the safety pharmacology studies were carried-out in compliance with GLP. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
PI3Kδ belongs to the Class I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks), part of a family of lipid kinases which 
mediate intracellular signalling pathways that regulate several key cellular functions, including survival, 
proliferation, and motility. The class I PI3Ks are composed of a regulatory subunit and a catalytic subunit 
which has kinase activity (designated p110α, p110β, p110γ, or p110δ). The catalytic subunit of the 
heterodimer defines the 4 Class I PI3K isoforms: PI3Kα, PIKβ, PI3Kγ, and PI3Kδ. Upon activation via cell 
surface receptor-ligand interactions, PI3Kδ phosphorylates the key lipid second messenger 
phosphatidylinositol to generate phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5, trisphophate (PIP3).  
PI3Kδ is a key signalling molecule in normal and malignant B lymphocytes. Signalling induced by 
stimulation or tonic activation of the B cell receptor (BCR), CD40, B-cell activating factor receptor 
(BAFFR), chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CXCR5, and integrins are all PI3Kδ-dependent(Figure 1). The 
receptors and their associated signalling pathways are critical to normal B lymphocyte function and 
evidence suggests they are also critical in B cell malignancies. 
Due to differences present in the ATP binding pocket between these Class I PI3K isoforms, selective 
inhibition of PI3Kδ can be achieved with a small molecule competitive ATP inhibitor.

Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro studies 
Receptor binding and activity 
The crystal structure of idelalisib bound to p110δ was determined in order to understand the structural 
basis for the inhibition p110δ by idelalisib. The co-crystal structure shows that idelalisib is a competitive 
inhibitor of the ATP binding site of the PI3K p110δ catalytic domain. 
Idelalisib was evaluated for PI3Kδ potency and selectivity relative to the other class I PI3K isoforms using 
in vitro biochemical enzyme assays at steady-state concentrations of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). 
Enzymatic activity of the class I PI3K isoforms was measured using a time resolved fluorescence 
resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) assay that monitors formation of the product 3,4,5-inositol 
triphosphate molecule, as it competes with fluorescently labelled PIP3 for binding to the GRP-1 pleckstrin 
homology domain protein.

Idelalisib was screened for its potential to interact with 353 kinases including 30 mutant kinases or inhibit 
a panel of 131 kinases using KINOMEscan (DiscoveRx) and KinaseProfiler™ screening; at a concentration 
of 10 μM idelalisib did not significantly interact with any of the kinases other than the PI3K isoforms. 
The major metabolite of idelalisib, GS-563117 (also called CAL-244), an oxidative metabolite, was 
evaluated for its potential to bind or inhibit PI3Kδ and other Class I isoforms as well as other kinases. 
GS-563117 did not show inhibitory activity at any of PI3K kinases and among 442 other kinases it only 
showed binding to Ste20-like kinase (SLK) and lymphocyte-oriented kinase (LOK) and inhibition studies 
with these kinases demonstrated IC50 values of 110 nM and 50 nM, respectively.  
The cellular potency of idelalisib against all 4 of the Class I PI3K isoforms, PI3Kα, PI3Kβ, PI3Kγ, and PI3Kδ 
was determined using a series of PI3K isoform-specific in vitro cell-based assays using primary human 
basophils, lymphocytes and murine embryonic fibroblasts. To evaluate cell-based potency in the presence 
of human plasma, a whole blood cell-based assay using PI3Kδ- and PI3Kγ-specific stimuli was also 
utilised.

The pharmacological activity of idelalisib was evaluated in malignant B-cells cell lines that were derived 
from patients with indolent lymphoma, specifically follicular lymphoma (FL), diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma (DLBCL), and acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL). Idelalisib potently inhibited the cell viability 
of the FL lines WSU-FSCCL and WSU-NHL with an EC50 of 0.03 µM in a 72-hour assay. In the WSU-FSCCL 
FL cell line, idelalisib inhibited cell proliferation and caused cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase of the cell 
cycle as demonstrated by an increased proportion of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and a 
corresponding decrease in cells in the S and G2/M phase. In the FL cell line WSU-NHL, idelalisib induced 
apoptosis at concentrations of 0.5 and 5 µM with a similar level of effect at both concentrations as 
demonstrated by an increase in the sub-G1 cell cycle population, increased Annexin V positivity, as 
determined by flow cytometry, and increased cleaved caspase 3 and cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) 
polymerase (PARP) expression as determined by ELISA. 
The SU-DHL-5, WSU-NHL, KARPAS-422 and CCRF-SB cell lines, derived respectively from patients with 
DLBCL, FL, FL, and ALL, were utilized to evaluate the effect of idelalisib on inhibiting PI3Kδ-mediated 
intracellular signaling with the phosphorylation status of Akt and S6 ribosomal protein (S6RP) as 
endpoints. Serum-starved cells were incubated with idelalisib for 1 hour and evaluated by immunoblot 
and ELISA analyses to measure the relative levels of phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) and phosphorylated S6RP 
(pS6RP). Treatment with idelalisib caused a dose-dependent reduction in pAkt (pAktT308) and pS6RP 
(pS6RPS235/236) at EC50 values ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 µM for the individual cell lines. Treatment with 
idelalisib for 24 hours at concentrations of 0.5 or 1.0 µM resulted in a 3- to 5-fold increase in apoptosis as 
measured by population of Annexin V-positive cells using flow cytometry. 
Studies were performed with fresh isolates of primary tumor cell samples obtained from patients with FL, 
chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). FL samples attained from patients 
(n=7) were evaluated for levels of pAkt (p-AktS473) by flow cytometry before and after stimulation of the 
BCR with anti-IgM/IgG. The effect of idelalisib on p-AktS473 at a concentration of 0.1µM was evaluated in 
un-stimulated and BCR-stimulated patient samples. In all (7/7) samples tested in absence of BCR 
stimulation, idelalisib reduced the basal p-AktS473 levels by 1% to 29%. However, in all (7/7) patient 
samples with BCR stimulation, idelalisib inhibited the Akt phosphorylation; the average percent inhibition 
of p-AktS473 levels was 86% and the range was 55% to 97% 
In primary tumour samples attained from patients with CLL (n=5) and MCL (n=5), levels of pAkt 
(p-AktT308) were present in the samples indicating constitutive activation of a PI3K-dependent pathway in 
these cells. Idelalisib treatment in vitro for 1 hour at a concentration of 100 nM resulted in a 60% 
reduction in pAktT308 compared to untreated samples.

In primary CLL cells freshly isolated from patients, the expression of PI3Kδ was consistently detected at 
high levels by western blot in all of the samples tested (n=40). Treatment with idelalisib caused a 
dose-dependent induction of apoptosis in primary CLL cells (n=7); the mean percentage of apoptotic cells 
at 1 μM was 28% with range from 0% to 54% and at 10 μM was 60% with a range from 26% to 78%. 
Nurse-like cells (NLC) present within the tumour microenvironment support malignant B-cell viability and 
growth. NLCs secrete the chemokines CXCL12 and CXCL13 which attract or induce homing of iNHL cells 
and CLL cells via the cognate chemokine receptors CXCR5 and CXCR4. NLCs also stimulate malignant 
B-cell proliferation by secretion of B-cell-activating factor and through stimulation of the BCR. To model 
some of the stimulatory interactions present in the tumour microenvironment primary CLL cells were 
stimulated through the BCR with anti-IgM or by co-culture with NCLs. MCL samples were stimulated 
through the CD40 pathway with soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L). These stimuli caused rapid 
phosphorylation of Akt to pAktS473 in vehicle-treated cultures and pre-treatment with idelalisib at 
concentrations of 0.1 to 1.0 µM inhibited the generation of pAktS473 by 90% or more. 
In primary CLL cells attained from patients (n=15), stimulation of the BCR with anti-IgM antibody caused 
increased CLL cell viability, while idelalisib treatment significantly reduced cell viability of BCR-stimulated 
CLL cells at all concentrations tested (0.5, 1, 5 and 10 µM) below the level of the un-stimulated controls. 
A similar effect of idelalisib on CLL cell viability was also demonstrated in primary CLL cells from patients 
(n=12) co-cultured with NLCs. The viability of CLL cells was increased when co-cultured with NLCs 
compared to cultured alone. Idelalisib caused a dose-dependent inhibition of CLL viability in NLC 
co-cultures at concentrations of 0.5, 1, 5, and 10 µM. 
Chemokines and chemokine receptors are produced by malignant B cells in FL and CLL and have roles in 
homing to and maintenance of the tumour microenvironment in these malignancies. Stimulation of the 
BCR with anti-IgM resulted in a marked increase in secreted levels of the chemokines CCL3 and CCL4 by 
CLL cells. This effect was significantly inhibited by idelalisib at concentrations of 1 μM or greater. 
Co-culture with NLCs also similarly induced CLL cells to secrete high concentrations of CCL3 and CCL4 into 
the supernatants and this secretion was significantly inhibited by idelalisib at concentrations of 0.5 μM or 
greater. 
To evaluate the effect of idelalisib on chemokine-induced signalling responses in CLL cells, primary CLL 
cells from patients (n= 3) were treated with the chemokines CXCL12 or CXCL13; evaluation of BCR 
stimulation with anti-IgM was also done. Idelalisib inhibited Akt and Erk phosphorylation in response to 
anti-IgM stimulation and in response to CXCL12 or CXCL13, respectively. 
In vivo studies 
The Applicant did not provide any in vivo data supporting the use of idelalisib in iNHL or CLL (see 
discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Molecular target screening 
Idelalisib was evaluated for its potential to interfere with ligand-receptor binding in a panel of 61 
receptors including GPCRs, ion channels, receptor tyrosine kinases, steroid receptors, and transporters. 
In these radioligand displacement assays, idelalisib had no significant effect at a concentration of 10 µM.

Effect on bone marrow cells 
The effect of idelalisib on rat erythroid lineage development was assessed in a study in Sprague Dawley 
rat-derived bone marrow cultures. Thy-1+cells were isolated and cultured in the presence of idelalisib or 
LY294002 (positive control) with or without erythropoietin. The cultured cells were assessed for erythroid 
precursors by flow cytometry and quantification of BFU-e in MethoCult cultures. Treatment with 50 µM of 
the positive control, LY294002 (a pan-PI3K inhibitor), in the presence or absence of erythropoietin, 
inhibited the increases in CD36+ cells on Day 3, CD71+ cells on Day 6 and 9, and Ter-119+ cells as 
measured by flow cytometry. Idelalisib did not significantly inhibit erythroid differentiation at 0.1 or 1 µM, 
either in the presence or absence of erythropoietin. At 10 µM, idelalisib decreased or prevented the 
progression of the erythroid differentiation beyond the CD36+ state. idelalisib decreased the BFU-e values 
at 10 and 100 µM significantly in the absence of erythropoietin. In the presence of erythropoietin there 
was a modest decrease in the BFU-e values with 10 and 100 µM idelalisib. 
The potential effect of idelalisib on human bone marrow mononuclear cell cultures were evaluated in 14 
day cultures in liquid phase in the presence of growth factors, with and without added erythropoietin 
(EPO), with our without positive control agents, and with or without idelalisib at concentrations of 0.1, 1, 
10, and 50 μM. Cells were evaluated in soft agar colony formation assays for their ability to form colonies 
wherein total colony forming units (CFU), burst forming units-erythroid (BFU-e), burst forming units- 
granulocyte monocyte (BFU-GM) and burst forming units-megakaryocytes (BFU-mk) were evaluated. 
Idelalisib caused concentration-dependent decreases on erythroid differentiation (with and without EPO) 
and myeloid differentiation at all concentrations tested. At 0.1, 1, 10 and 50 μM, idelalisib inhibited BFU-e 
in the absence and presence of EPO, the latter by 67, 83, 100 and 100 %, respectively, and inhibited 
CFU-GM by 45, 68, 85 and 90%, respectively. Effects on CFU-mk were present only at 10 and 50 µM 
concentrations. The control compounds, LY294002 (pan-PI3K inhibitor), NVP-BEZ235 (pan-PI3K/mTOR 
inhibitor), and AG490 (Jak2 inhibitor) also influenced these processes at concentrations previously 
reported to affect hematopoietic progenitor cell differentiation. 
Effect on human T-cells and NK-cells 
The effect of idelalisib on normal T-lymphocytes and NK cell survival was assessed in a study using cells 
isolated from human blood. T-cell receptor (TCR)-mediated proliferation of T-cells is abolished by 
pan-PI3K inhibition. Isolated human peripheral blood lymphocytes were treated with either vehicle or 
idelalisib prior to TCR activation by adding antihuman CD3ε antibody. CD3-induced proliferation response 
was measured by incorporation of [3H]thymidine. Proliferation of T-lymphocytes was inhibited by 
idelalisib with an EC50 of 973 nM. Cultures of CD3+ T-lymphocytes and CD56+ NK cells isolated from blood 
samples obtained from 9 healthy volunteers were each incubated with idelalisib for 48 hours at 
concentrations of 0.1, 1, and 10 µM; untreated isolated cells were used as controls for each sample. 
Viability was determined by expression of Annexin V and uptake of propidium iodide as determined by 
flow cytometry and was calculated relative to time-matched untreated control cells. Idelalisib exposure 
had no effects on the viability of normal T-lymphocytes or NK cells. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Effects on central nervous system 
Single doses of the vehicle (0.5% carboxymethylcellulose, 0.1% Tween® 80 in water), or idelalisib at 50, 
100, or 150 mg/kg were administered orally to male and female Sprague Dawley rats via gavage at a 
dose volume of 10 mL/kg (7 to13 males/group, 8 to 12 females/group). The rats were evaluated in the 
modified Irwin functional observational battery at 2 and 24 hours after dosing. There were no adverse 
effects of idelalisib in the modified Irwin test of CNS general signs and behavior at doses up to 150 mg/kg.

Effects on cardiovascular and respiratory system 
The effect of idelalisib on the stably expressed hERG (human ether-a-go-go-related gene) potassium 
channel current in HEK293 cells was assessed using a rubidium flux-based method. Idelalisib was tested 
at 10 concentrations ranging from 0.0977 to 50 µM. There was no dose-response trend or significant 
inhibition of the hERG channel up to 50 µM. 
The potential for idelalisib to cause adverse cardiovascular and respiratory effects following 
administration of a single dose was evaluated in telemetered non-naïve male dogs. Idelalisib was orally 
administered via capsule to 4 conscious, telemetered beagle dogs at 0 (lactose monohydrate vehicle 
only), 1, 5, and 20 mg/kg in a Latin Square crossover design with an interval of approximately 3 days 
between doses. At single doses up to 20 mg/kg, idelalisib did not produce any adverse effects on heart 
rate, respiratory rate, core body temperature, arterial blood gas parameters, or ECG parameters (PR, 
QRS, QT, and QTc intervals) up to 24 hours after dose administration. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
In vitro data indicated that idelalisib is not an inhibitor of the metabolising enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2B6, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A, or UGT1A1, or of the transporters OAT1, OAT3, or OCT2. 
GS-563117 is not an inhibitor of the metabolising enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, 
CYP2D6 or UGT1A1, or of the transporters P gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, or OCT2. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Idelalisib showed high forward permeability in Caco 2 cell monolayers. The efflux ratio decreased with 
increasing concentration of idelalisib, suggesting that idelalisib was a substrate for efflux transporters and 
that efflux transporters were saturated. 
Idelalisib is primarily metabolized by aldehyde oxidase to its major circulating plasma metabolite, 
GS-563117. In rat, dog, and monkey, plasma levels of GS-563117 are below those of idelalisib. However, 
in humans GS-563117 plasma levels exceed those of idelalisib. 
Idelalisib exhibits moderately high plasma protein binding in mouse, rat, dog, and human. After po 
administration of [14C] to rats and dogs, radioactivity is widely distributed, but relatively excluded from 
bone, brain, spinal cord, and eye lens in rats and from brain and eyes in dogs. In rats, the radioactivity 
declines steadily and most tissues have undetectable levels by 72 hours post dose. 
The oral bioavailability is moderate. The volume of distribution is greater than the volume of total body 
water in all species. Clearance of idelalisib is moderate to high in the rat and moderate in the dog and 
cynomolgus monkey.

(blanching of skin and gums, cold body), dyspnea, transient cessation 
of breathing following a forced inspiration, lethargy and ataxia. 
Surviving animals observed for 7 days post-dose. Males given 200 
mg/kg survived until scheduled necropsy with clinical observations of 
watery/loose stool and/or emesis. Animals given 25 and 50 mg/kg 
noted with loose black stool containing yellow mucus, emesis, and 
decreased FC. BW loss (≤ 10%) in all dose groups. 
At 10 mg/kg, the mean AUC 0-last was 103 and 159 µg∙h/mL for males 
and females, respectively.  
At 10 mg/kg, the mean C max was 8.3 and 16.4 µg/mL for males and 
females, respectively.

Mortality 
There were 9 unscheduled deaths in the 100 mg/kg/day (1 male, 3 females) 
and 150 mg/kg/day (1 male, 4 females) groups. Other than one female animal 
in  the  100 mg/kg/day  group  that  died  on  Day 12  of  dosing,  all  other 
idelalisib-related deaths occurred after completion of the dosing period during 
the  4-week  recovery  period.  Increases  in  serum  alanine  aminotransferase 
(ALT),  aspartate  aminotransferase  (AST),  alkaline  phosphatase  (ALP)  and 
gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) in several of these animals correlated with

hepatic  necrosis  and/or  tongue  ulceration.  In  general,  severe  bone  marrow 
depletion with  marked  myeloid  hyperplasia  and  erythroid depletion  was  also 
seen  in  these  early  deaths.  Overall,  the  microscopic findings  among  animals 
that  died  or  were  euthanized  in  moribund  condition  reflected  more  severe 
presentations of similar, milder findings seen among animals from these dose 
groups that survived to the conclusion of the 4-week dosing period. 
Clinical signs 
> 100 mg/kg/day:  excessive  salivation  leading  to  wet  fur  and/or  dry,  red 
material on the fur due to porphyrin staining. 
Clinical pathology 
> 100 mg/kg/day: Reversible decreases in total white blood cells (WBC) (0.46- 
to 0.53-fold), primarily due to decreases in absolute lymphocyte counts (0.26- 
to  0.51-fold).  This  correlated  with  reversible  hyperplasia  of  myeloid  and 
granulocytic  lineage  cells  in  the  bone  marrow  with  concurrent  decreases  in 
erythroid precursors. 
150 mg/kg: Small reversible reductions in several erythrocyte parameters (ie, 
RBC, HGB, HCT) (0.84- to 0.96-fold). 
No toxicological relevant changes in serum chemistry were seen among animals 
that survived to the conclusion of the 4-week dosing period. 
Histopathology and organ weights 
> 100 mg/kg/day:  Decreased  thymus  weight  correlating  with  lymphocyte 
depletion. 
Dose-related  decrease  in  secondary  follicles  of  lymph  nodes  and  Peyer’s 
patches.  B  cell  reduction  in  spleen  and  thymus.  Lymphocyte  reductions 
generally more severe in females. Effects on lymphocyte numbers and subsets 
were reversible. 
Decreased testis and epididymis weights were present in all idelalisib-treated 
male  groups  and  correlated  with  dose-dependent,  minimal  to  mild 
degeneration  of  the  seminiferous  tubules  and decreased  spermatozoa  in  the 
epididymis.  These  changes were  incompletely  reversed  following  the 4-week 
recovery period. 
A  reversible  increase  in  incidence  of  chronic  inflammatory  cell  infiltrates 
(macrophages, lymphocytes, and plasma  cells) in the liver was seen in both 
male  and  female  animals  treated  with  idelalisib  at  all  dose  levels. Increased 
liver weight (F: > 100 mg/kg; M: 150 mg/kg) without microscopic correlates. 
A  slightly  increased  incidence  and/or  severity  of  generally  minor  chronic 
inflammatory  cell  infiltrates  (macrophages,  lymphocytes,  and  plasma  cells) 
were  seen  in  the  myocardium  of  all  idelalisib-treated  groups  of  rats  except 
50 mg/kg/day females after 4 weeks of dosing and persisted after the 4-week 
recovery period. 
There  were  no  idelalisib-related  effects  on  mortality,  body  weight,  food 
consumption,  ophthalmic  examination  results,  haematology,  coagulation,  or 
urinalysis  parameters  in  males  and  females  and  no  clearly  idelalisib-related 
clinical chemistry changes. 
Clinical signs 
90 mg/kg: Wet fur and discoloured material around the eyes and nose, and an 
unkempt appearance (2/15F). Three female rats had inflammatory changes in 
the  skin  and  mucocutaneous 
in 
haematological and/or clinical chemistry parameters. No similar effects were

Mortality 
One female dog in the 20 mg/kg/day group was found moribund on Day 29 
prior to scheduled necropsy. This animal had shown clinical signs that included 
soft faeces, faecal blood, red discoloured eyes, shivering, thin body condition, 
lethargy, salivation, mouth ulceration and inappetence with loss of body weight 
(-21%)  beginning  on  Day  10.  Marked  depletion  of  thymic  lymphocytes  with 
minimal haemorrhage and moderate congestion may have led to moderate to 
marked  suppurative 
lungs  with  mild  multifocal 
haemorrhage. Aspiration pneumonia could not be ruled out, however, because 
this animal had an episode of vomiting on Day 17. Minimal to mild congestion or 
haemorrhage in the large intestine was consistent with similar GI-tract changes 
seen in other idelalisib-treated animals

Clinical signs 
20 mg/kg: Soft faeces and apparent faecal blood. Decreased food consumption 
and lowered body weights in females (-8.3%). Nasal or ocular discharge more 
frequent. 
Clinical pathology 
≥2.5 mg/kg: Decreases in absolute basophil counts (21% to 38% of control) 
showing recovery. Decreases in circulating lymphocyte numbers in females, in 
the 20 mg/kg group persisting through the recovery period. 
20 mg/kg: Elevated ALT, AST, and ALP in females, showing recovery.  
Histopathology and organ weights 
≥2.5 mg/kg: Dose-dependent decreases in testicular weight (45% to 69% of 
control) at the conclusion of the 4 week recovery period, appearing to correlate 
with reduced spermatogenesis microscopically at doses of 5 mg/kg/day. 
≥5 mg/kg: Mild reversible lymphoid depletion in the axillary and inguinal lymph 
nodes. 
20 mg/kg: Moderate lymphoid depletion in the Peyer’s patch of the ileum, mild 
to  marked  lymphoid  depletion  in  the  axillary  and  inguinal  lymph  nodes,  and 
moderate  to  marked  lymphoid  depletion  or  cortical  lymphoid  necrosis  in  the 
thymus. In general reversible, with the exception of persistent mild lymphoid 
depletion in the Peyer’s patches of 2/3 females. 
Histologic findings in the liver included minimal to mild cytoplasmic rarefaction 
and necrosis of hepatocytes, and minimal to moderate hepatocellular swelling 
primarily in centrilobular to mid-zonal regions. Chronic inflammation (primarily 
macrophages  and 
individual  necrotic 
lymphocytes),  often  surrounded 
hepatocytes. Minimal hepatocellular necrosis was also observed in 1 of 4 males 
at 5 mg/kg/day idelalisib and 1 control male. 
Hepatic findings often correlated with 1 or more modest increases in ALT (3.9- 
to 136-fold), AST (2.3- to 44.3-fold), ALP (2.0- to 7.3-fold), and GGT (1.7- to 
4.3-fold),  and/or  total  bilirubin  (1.5-  to  6.0-fold)  at  the  Day  29  necropsy. 
Although some liver findings were identified on Day 57, they were usually of 
lower severity than Day 29 and were unaccompanied by noteworthy elevations 
in serum enzyme concentrations; thus, the hepatic findings were considered

Mortality 
Two idelalisib-treated animals (a 2.5 mg/kg/day group female [Week 33] and a 
7.5 mg/kg/day group male [Week 21]) were euthanized in moribund condition 
prior to the scheduled necropsy. The cause of death for these 2 animals was 
systemic  inflammation  (likely  sepsis)  which  was  secondary  to  decreased 
lymphocytes in multiple peripheral lymphoid tissues including spleen, thymus, 
Peyer’s patches, and lymph nodes. 
Clinical signs 
Clear  discharge  and  injected  sclera  in  several  animals  across  all  idelalisib 
groups  and  reddened  facial  area  in  the  7.5 mg/kg/day  group.  These  clinical 
findings generally resolved during the recovery period. 
Body weight 
7.5  mg/kg:  Decreases  in  mean  body  weight  gain  (males,  -11.3%;  females,

with  lesser  effects  in  typical  T-cell  regions,  of  the  spleen,  lymph  nodes 
(mandibular, mesenteric, and axillary), and Peyer’s patches. 
Minimal to slight increases in dilated crypts/glands, often accompanied by small 
numbers of mucosal granulocyte infiltrates (neutrophils and eosinophils) were 
seen in one or more segments of the GI tract (jejunum through rectum). 
Complete recovery of the histopathologic changes was noted at the end of the 
12-week  non-dosing  interval  with  the  following  exceptions:  minimal  to  mild 
decreases in lymphocytes persisted in the spleen and mesenteric lymph node of 
1 of 2 males in the 7.5 mg/kg/day group and a slightly increased severity of 
granulocyte infiltrates persisted in the ileum in the 7.5 mg/kg/day males.

A slight, but statistically significant increase 
in the incidence of micronucleated immature 
erythrocytes, with a group mean value for 
the 2000 mg/kg males slightly outside the 
laboratory historical negative control range 
primarily due to the results from 2 of 5 rats. 
There was also some evidence of a 
perturbation in erythropoiesis in the 
2000 mg/kg group as indicated by a 
statistically significant reduction in the 
proportion of immature erythrocytes at the 
48-hour sampling time point. 
Based on the mechanism of action of PI3Ks 
and their role as intracellular signalling 
proteins essential to migratory, 
proliferative, survival and differentiation 
pathways, idelalisib may cause small 
increase in micronucleated erythrocytes as a 
result of interference with cell division or 
other mechanisms unrelated to the inherent 
genotoxicity of the compound 
A Derek analysis of the main human metabolite GS-563117 showed no structural alerts for mutagenicity. 
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies with idelalisib have been submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects).

Reversible decreases in epididymis, cauda epididymis, and 
testes weights were noted at all dose levels correlating with 
reversibly decreased epididymal sperm concentrations in the 
25, 50, and 100 mg/kg/day groups. Visibly small testes 
correlated with testicular contraction in the absence of 
degeneration or loss of cellular stages of spermatogenesis in 
the testes microscopically. Cellular debris was present in the 
epididymis along with vacuolation of the pituitary gland at 
100 mg/kg/day, the only idelalisib-treated group examined 
microscopically. 
Although idelalisib-related decreased epididymal sperm 
numbers were noted in all treated groups, the decreases had 
no effect on reproductive indices. 
Following a 10-week non-dosing period, no significant organ 
weight, epididymal sperm concentration, or histological 
changes were noted indicating the changes were reversible 
upon discontinuation of dosing.

Based on the resorption of a single litter at 100 mg/kg/day 
which was of undetermined relationship to idelalisib 
administration the NOAEL for early embryonic toxicity was 
considered to be 50 mg/kg/day. Due to the lack of any other 
effects, 100 mg/kg/day, the highest dosage level evaluated, 
was considered the NOAEL for female systemic and 
reproductive toxicity of idelalisib when administered orally 
once-daily by gavage. 
The NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 75 mg/kg/day based on 
the death of 1 female, clinical findings of red vaginal discharge 
and/or red material on the urogenital area in several females, 
and lower mean body weight gains and food consumption at 
150 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL for embryo-fetal developmental 
toxicity was 25 mg/kg/day based on a higher incidence of 
post-implantation loss at 150 mg/kg/day, lower mean fetal 
weights at 75 and 150 mg/kg/day that correlated with sites of 
reduced fetal skeletal ossification, and increased incidences of 
short tail (75 and 150 mg/kg/day), anury, vertebral agenesis, 
microphthalmia/anophthalmia, and hydrocephaly 
(150 mg/kg/day) as well as skeletal developmental variations 
at 75 and 150 mg/kg/day.

Other toxicity studies 
Immunotoxicity: 
Evaluation of bone marrow recovery after cyclophosphamide administration 
Myelosuppression is often associated with chemotherapeutic regimens containing cyclophosphamide 
(CTX). This study evaluated the potential for idelalisib to induce or exacerbate CTX-induced 
myelosuppression in rats. Rats given a single dose of CTX at 75 mg/kg exhibited suppression of 
erythropoiesis and lower counts of WBCs. Rats give idelalisib at 50 mg/kg for 10 days had mildly lower 
WBCs and lymphocyte counts. Coadministration of idelalisib with CTX did not appear to exacerbate the 
myelosuppressive effects of CTX. 
Effects of idelalisib on T-cell dependent antibody responses 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/511776/2014  
Page 29/132 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The ability of idelalisib to alter the primary antibody-forming cell (AFC) response to sheep erythrocytes 
(sRBC) was assessed in rats. Female Lewis rats (5/group) were dosed twice daily via oral gavage with 
either the vehicle or idelalisib at doses of 1, 3, 10, 30, or 150 mg/kg/day for 10 days. CTX was used as a 
positive control and was administered IP (100 mg/kg) for two days. Four hours after the first dose (Day 
1), animals were immunized via IP injection with sRBC. The IgM and IgG primary AFC response was 
evaluated by ELISA from serum collected pre-test and on Days 7 and 10. Idelalisib was able to suppress 
the T-dependent antibody response to sRBC at doses of 10-150 mg/kg/day BID. 
Effect of idelalisib on host defense 
This study was conducted to investigate the potential ability of idelalisib to inhibit the normal short-term 
host defense response to a staphylococcal infection in a rat groin abscess model. Idelalisib doses of 30, 
60, and 120 mg/kg/dose administered once prior to infection and 12, 24 and 36 hours post infection 
inhibited growth of the infectious agent by between 65%, 72%, and 85% respectively relative to the 
vehicle control group. The positive control group (dexamethasone) demonstrated reduced host defense, 
leading to an increase in colony counts (+351%). Idelalisib did not inhibit the ability of the test system to 
tolerate the infectious challenge. 
Studies on impurities: 
Three potential in silico genotoxic positive process impurities (GS-567201, GS-606709, and GS-606710) 
were qualified in a GLP compliant bacterial reverse mutation test at a range of concentrations up to 5000 
μg/plate in the presence and absence of a S9 mix using the plate incorporation and preincubation method 
of the bacterial mutation test. None of the 3 potential impurities showed any evidence of genotoxic 
activity. 
Potential idelalisib related process impurities (GS-563116, GS-563118, GS-563120, GS-563973, and 
GS-575510) were qualified in a 28 day oral gavage toxicity study in rats (GLP). Sprague Dawley rats were 
assigned to 4 groups (10/sex/group) and received either the vehicle, 90 mg/kg/day idelalisib, or 25 or 90 
mg/kg/day of a lot of idelalisib spiked with these impurities. There were no differences in toxicity findings 
between the two lots. 
Phototoxicity: 
Idelalisib and the primary metabolite, GS-563117, were evaluated for the potential to induce 
phototoxicity in the embryonic murine fibroblast cell line BALB/c 3T3 using Neutral Red uptake as a 
marker of cellular viability in the presence and absence of UVA light exposure (non-GLP). Concentrations 
from 0 to 100 µg/mL of idelalisib and GS-563117 were evaluated twice, with and without UVA exposure, 
at a light dosage of 5 J/cm2. Phototoxicity results for idelalisib were inconclusive due to cytotoxicity. The 
primary oxidative metabolite, GS-563117, was phototoxic in this assay. 
Mechanistic studies: 
Two studies were performed in dogs to study transaminase elevation and the potential of beclomethasone 
diproprionate (BDP) or budesonide to alter the magnitude or time course of any observed effects. 
Female dogs administered idelalisib at 15 mg/kg/day without concomitant BDP administration exhibited 
a pattern of multifocal, primarily centrilobular hepatocellular degenerative and/or necrotic changes that 
were associated with expected secondary inflammatory changes as a result of tissue repair responses 
commonly seen following the administration of a number of different chemically diverse xenobiotic 
agents. These changes were variably associated with modest, transient serum transaminase elevations, 
typically occurring between Days 13 and 27 that spontaneously resolved during continued dosing. Dogs

pretreated with BDP for 14 days prior to idelalisib administration had evidence of expected steroid 
histopathologic responses and did not show transient transaminase elevations at examined time points. 
Female dogs administered idelalisib at 15 mg/kg/day without concomitant budesonide (BUD) 
administration exhibited variable, transient transaminase elevations between Days 21 and 42 that 
generally resolved spontaneously with continued idelalisib administration. Concomitant and pretreatment 
with BUD appeared to limit the magnitude and delayed the emergence of these transient transaminase 
elevations.

Idelalisib is not PBT as log Kow does not exceed 4.5. As a result of the above considerations, the available 
data do not allow to conclude definitively on the potential risk of idelalisib to the environment.  A Phase II 
assessment will be performed and submitted by the end of 2015.  
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Idelalisib induces apoptosis and inhibits proliferation in cell lines derived from malignant B cells and in 
primary tumour cells. Through inhibition of chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CXCR5 signalling induced by 
the chemokines CXCL12 and CXCL13, respectively, idelalisib inhibits homing and retention of malignant B 
cells in the tumour microenvironment including lymphoid tissues and the bone marrow (see section 5.1 of 
the SmPC). 
The mechanistic in vitro studies performed by the applicant with tumour cell lines and primary tumour 
cells demonstrate a direct anti-tumour effect on CLL and MCL. These studies show that most of the 
anti-tumour response is due to inhibition of signalling from cytokines and/or interaction with other cells. 
The data from the applicant shows an involvement of chemokines and the B cell receptors but also other 
stimuli may be involved (IL-6, CD40, integrins). This inhibition may act in two directions: by reducing 
tumour cell proliferation and survival and by disturbing the tumour microenvironment.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/511776/2014

Idelalisib reduced viability in primary CLL cells. It is noted that reduced viability was not seen in all patient 
samples. Of the patient samples shown, a fraction (~25%) responded to idelalisib. In Study DR-4002 
data of only 7 patient samples was shown.  
An important property of idelalisib is the high degree of selectivity for the PI3Kδ kinase versus the other 
PI3K (α, β, γ).  
Idelalisib shows a high selectivity in the screens with other kinases and a broader panel of receptors and 
ion channels. But even if off-target activity is absent or minimal, secondary pharmacological events are 
likely to occur through the inhibition of PI3Kδ. The studies on haematopoiesis showed a possible 
interference by idelalisib however, toxicological data do not suggest haematological toxicity. Effects on 
lymphocyte populations, primarily B-cells, are observed but these effects are most likely due to inhibition 
of PI3Kδ in mature lymphocytes.  
No inhibition of T-cell proliferation was observed in in vitro studies. However, PI3Kδ is active in T cells and 
likely to be of functional importance. The effects of a PI3Kδ inhibitor are most likely not limited to 
inhibition of growth and survival of B cells and B cell malignancies. In particular, there may be 
consequences for immune regulation, and such effects may be important for the safety profile of idelalisib 
(see RMP). 
The Applicant did not submit any in vivo data supporting the use of idelalisib in iNHL or CLL. In the 
literature several murine B-cell lymphoma models can be found, these include spontaneous models of 
B-cell lymphoma as well as induced models. While data from animal models may have been supportive for 
this application, it is noted that there is ample data with patients samples. Given the in vitro data and the 
clinical experience, no further in vivo pharmacodynamic studies in animal models are required. 
According to the CHMP Guideline on the Investigation of Drug Interactions (CPMP/EWP/560/95/Rev. 1 
Corr.*), the need for pharmacodynamics drug interaction studies should be determined on a 
case-by-case basis and should be considered for drugs which compete with each other at the 
pharmacological target and/or have similar or opposing pharmacodynamic (therapeutic or adverse) 
effects. In subjects with iNHL or CLL, idelalisib has been evaluated clinically in combination with 
anti-CD20 antibodies (rituximab or ofatumumab) and/or chemotherapeutic agents (bendamustine, 
fludarabine, or chlorambucil). Based on the mechanism of action of idelalisib and the different 
mechanisms of actions of each of these individual agents, no pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies 
were considered necessary. 
Toxicokinetics data from repeat-dose toxicity studies allow for extrapoplation. In rats, a dose of 
150 mg/kg resulted in a Cmax of 21.8 μg/ml (mean of values from male and female rats). In dogs, a dose 
of 20 mg/kg resulted in a Cmax of 6.86 μg/ml (mean of values from male and female dogs). In patients 
at the recommended dose of 150 mg, Cmax was 1.9 μg/ml. Thus, the performed studies would  reach 
sufficient exposure to conclude on the absence of a non-clinical concern about acute adverse effects on 
CNS, cardiovascular and respiratory systems. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Analytical methods used in the GLP safety studies are appropriate and validated for their purpose. 
Protein binding is low to moderate, and there are no important species differences. Tissue distribution 
studies showed no signs of tissue retention. The metabolism of idelalisib seems to be well characterised.  
Toxicology 
In the repeat dose toxicity studies idelalisib induced lymphoid depletion in spleen, thymus, lymph nodes 
and gut associated lymphoid tissue.  In general, B lymphocyte dependent areas were more affected than 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/511776/2014  
Page 32/132 
 
 
 
 
 
T lymphocyte dependent areas.  In rats, idelalisib has the potential to inhibit T dependent antibody 
responses. However, idelalisib did not inhibit the normal host response to Staphylococcus aureus and did 
not exacerbate the myelosuppressive effect of cyclophosphamide. Idelalisib is not considered to have 
broad immunosuppressive activity. 
Idelalisib induced inflammatory changes in both rats and dogs. In studies up to 4 weeks in rats and dogs, 
hepatic necrosis was observed at 5 and 7 times the human exposure based on AUC, respectively. Serum 
transaminase elevations correlated with hepatic necrosis in dogs, but were not observed in rats. No 
hepatic impairment or chronic transaminase elevations were observed in rats or dogs in studies of 13 
weeks and longer duration (see section 5.3 of the SmPC). 
There are examples where it has been demonstrated that genetic defects in certain immunological 
signalling pathways may lead to a deregulated immune system, resulting in inflammation due to 
autoimmune reactions or exaggerated immune reactivity to environmental non-pathogens. The 
possibility that inhibition of PI3Kδ in B and T lymphocytes could have such consequences should be 
considered. This could be a possible explanation for non-clinical adverse events, gastrointestinal toxicity, 
systemic inflammation and hepatic toxicity. This possibility is supported by the demonstration of chronic 
colitis in mice with a knockout mutation in PI3Kδ (Uno et al 2010). Further characterisation of the immune 
consequences of idelalisib treatment will be performed as part of the RMP. The applicant has outlined a 
study program including in vitro evaluation of the effect of idealisib on T-cell proliferation, cytokine 
production and specific studies with regulatory T-cells. The effect of idealisib in autoimmune disease 
models will be studied in rats (collagen-induced arthritis) and mice (MRL/Lpr model of lupus). These 
studies will be reported as part of the RMP by the end of Q1 2015. 
A standard genotoxicity package was performed with negative outcome. Idelalisib did not induce 
mutations in the microbial mutagenesis (Ames) assay, was not clastogenic in the in vitro chromosome 
aberration assay using human peripheral blood lymphocytes, and was not genotoxic in the in vivo rat 
micronucleus study. The minor chromosomal effects at the high dose in the rat study are most likely due 
to the pharmacological effect on PI3K kinases, with all isotypes affected at this high dose. 
No carcinogenicity studies with idelalisib have been conducted. Carcinogenicity studies are in general not 
required to support marketing for therapeutics intended to treat patients with advanced cancer. However, 
considering that life expectancy may be relatively long in some of these patients, in this particular case, 
there is a further need for carcinogenicty studies for idelalisib as well as for the major metabolite 
GS-563117. The applicant will conduct carcinogenity studies to address this concern (see RMP). 
In an embryo foetal development study in rats, increased post implantation loss, malformations (absence 
of caudal vertebrae and in some cases also of sacral vertebrae), skeletal variations and lower foetal body 
weights were observed. Malformations were observed at exposures from 12 times the human exposure 
based on AUC.  Effects on embryo foetal development were not investigated in a second species (see 
sections 4.6 and 5.3 of the SmPC). Based on these findings, idelalisib may cause foetal harm.  Women 
should avoid becoming pregnant while taking idelalisib, and for up to 1 month after ending treatment.  
Therefore, women of childbearing potential must use highly effective contraception while taking idelalisib 
and for 1 month after stopping treatment.  It is currently unknown whether idelalisib may reduce the 
effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives, and therefore women using hormonal contraceptives should 
add a barrier method as a second form of contraception. 
Degeneration of the seminiferous tubules in the testes was observed in 2 to 13 week repeated dose 
studies in dogs and rats, but not in studies of 26 weeks and longer duration. In a rat male fertility study, 
decreases in epididymides and testes weight were observed but no adverse effects on mating or fertility

parameters, and no degeneration or loss in spermatogenesis were observed. As a consequence, 
restriction to father a child was not required for idelalisib. 
Female fertility was not affected in rats (see section 5.3 of the SmPC). Although there are no human data 
available on the effect of idelalisib on fertility, animal studies indicate the potential for harmful effects of 
idelalisib on fertility and foetal development (see section 4.6). Similarly, there are no or limited amount 
of data from the use of idelalisib in pregnant women. However since studies in animals have shown 
reproductive toxicity, idelalisib is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing 
potential not using contraception. 
No studies on metabolites were performed. For the major human metabolite GS-563117, exposure in 
animal studies did not reach above 1/10 of the clinical exposure. GS-563117 lacks activity at PI3K and 
showed a low oral bioavailability in nonclinical species. In ICH S9, it is stated that a separate evaluation 
of human metabolites that have not been qualified in other studies is generally not warranted for patients 
with advanced cancer. However, for these indications, life expectancy may be considered sufficiently long 
to warrant further carcinogenicity investigation. Since human exposure to the metabolite exceeds the 
exposure to the parent compound, and exposure in animal studies is less than 1/10 of the clinical 
exposure, further safety data related to the metabolite could be of value. The applicant has presented 
data showing poor bioavailability in the rat, and i.v. dosing was associated with short half-life. An i.v. 
repeat dose toxicity study in rat was not considered feasible. However, a dose-range finding (DRF) study 
including toxicokinetic analysis has now been conducted in mice showing a 2-fold exposure to the 
metabolite in terms of Cmax as compared to humans, and an AUC which is 73% of the steady state AUC in 
humans. Although clinical AUC values are not reached in mice, it is considered that the study in mice will 
provide sufficient data to base a risk assessment with regard to the metabolite. The data from the 4 week 
repeat-dose toxicity study in mice will be reported in Q4 2014 (see RMP). 
During the procedure, the applicant has submitted an in silico analysis using DEREK revealing no 
genotoxic potential of metabolite GS-563117. The negative in silico outcome and the fact that the 
metabolite is structurally similar to the parent idelalisib were considered sufficient to conclude that 
GS-563117 is unlikely to be genotoxic. Preliminary data suggest that in mice dosing with idelalisib leads 
to exposure to the metabolite allowing for qualification. The data from a 4 week repeat-dose toxicity study 
will be reported as part of the RMP in Q4 2014. To further identify potential safety concerns for the 
metabolite an extended (non-kinase) receptor binding study will be performed and reported in Q4 2014. 
The SAG-oncology was consulted on whether data on mutagenicity and carcinogenicity would be required 
prior to authorisation and the SAG-O concluded that such data could be provide post-authorisation (see 
additional expert consultation, below).  
A number of dedicated studies addressed certain aspects of immunotoxicity. These studies did not show 
any important effects of idelalisib. The antibody response was clearly inhibited, but the conclusions from 
this study are weakened by the fact that the immune response in the control group was weak, and no 
convincing quantification of the antibody response was shown. The possibility that idelalisib treatment 
results in immune deregulation, resulting in autoimmune responses and exaggerated immune reactivity 
to environmental non-pathogens will be further investigated by the applicant (see RMP). 
Evaluation of the potential for phototoxicity in the embryonic murine fibroblast cell line BALB/c 3T3 was 
inconclusive for idelalisib due to cytotoxicity in the in vitro assay. The major metabolite, GS-563117, may 
enhance phototoxicity when cells are simultaneously exposed to UVA light. There is a potential risk that 
idelalisib, via its major metabolite, GS-563117, may cause photosensitivity in treated patients (see 
section 5.3 of the SmPC). 
Idelalisib is not a PBT substance. The applicant was recommended to conduct a Phase II assessment. 
CHMP assessment report

Local tolerance studies have not been submitted. As the intended clinical route of administration is oral, 
and this route of administration has been employed in the toxicity studies, dedicated stand-alone local 
tolerance studies are not necessary. The local tolerance of idelalisib has been assessed in the general 
toxicity studies. 
Additional expert consultation 
Following the CHMP request, a Scientific Advisory Group meeting was convened on 10 June 2014 to 
provide advice on the following question: 
The mutagenicity and carcinogenicity data of the parent substance and main human 
metabolite (GS-563117) were not complete in the initial application. What data would be 
required before and/or after registration to address this deficiency taking prior and 
alternative treatment options as well as prognosis with respect to survival into account? In 
addition, would absence of such data influence your willingness to prescribe idelalisib?  
The feedback was that despite interspecies differences in metabolites, especially the main metabolite, 
there are no signals at the moment that would warrant limiting prescription according to proposed 
indication. Thus, further data to address this issue pre-authorisation are not required on clinical grounds. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the non-clinical documentation submitted was considered adequate. The relevant information 
has been included in the SmPC (sections 4.4, 4.6, 5.1, 5.3). The applicant will conduct non-clinical 
studies to further evaluate the role of aldehyde oxidase in the metabolism of idelalisib, DDI of idelalisib 
with transport substrates, the safety of the main human metabolite GS-563117 and the carcinogenicity 
of idelalisib.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption 
Following oral administration of a single dose of idelalisib, peak plasma concentrations were observed 2 to 
4 hours post-dose under fed conditions and after 0.5 to 1.5 hours under fasted conditions. 
Following 150 mg twice daily administration of idelalisib, average (range) Cmax and AUC at steady state 
were 1,953 (272; 3,905) ng/mL and 10,439 (2,349; 29,315) ng•h/mL for idelalisib and 4,039 (669; 
10,897) ng/mL and 39,744 (6,002; 119,770) ng•h/mL for GS-563117, respectively.  The plasma 
exposures (Cmax and AUC) of idelalisib are approximately dose proportional between 50 mg and 100 mg 
and less than dose proportional above 100 mg (see section 5.2 of the SmPC).  
Absolute bioavailability was not determined, but an oral/iv microdose study suggests that a high fraction 
of the dose is absorbed. The passive in vitro permeability in Caco-2 cells was high and idelalisib was an in 
vitro substrate for the efflux transporters Pgp and BCRP. 
Effects of food 
CHMP assessment report

Relative to fasting conditions, administration of an early capsule formulation of idelalisib with a high-fat 
meal resulted in no change in Cmax and a 36% increase in mean AUCinf.  Idelalisib can be administered 
without regard to food. (see section 5.2 of the SmPC). 
Distribution 
In the population pharmacokinetic model, idelalisib PK data was best described by a two-compartment 
model and the typical central and peripheral volume of distribution was 23 and 73 L, respectively. 
Idelalisib is 93% to 94% bound to human plasma proteins at concentrations observed clinically.  The 
mean blood-to-plasma concentration ratio was approximately 0.5.  The apparent volume of distribution 
for idelalisib (mean) was approximately 96 L (see section 5.2 of the SmPC). 
Elimination 
Idelalisib is metabolised primarily via aldehyde oxidase, and to a lesser extent via CYP3A and UGT1A4. 
The main metabolite both in plasma, faeces and urine was the oxidative metabolite GS-563117. The 
metabolite has no pharmacological activity on PI3K∂. 
Maximum plasma concentrations are observed after 1-2 hours. The terminal elimination half-life of 
idelalisib was 8.2 (range: 1.9; 37.2) hours and the apparent clearance of idelalisib was 14.9 (range: 5.1; 
63.8) L/h following idelalisib 150 mg twice daily oral administration.   
A mass-balance study was performed, with drug dissolved in ethanol. Following a single 150 mg oral dose 
of [14C] labelled idelalisib, approximately 78% and 15% was excreted in faeces and urine, respectively.  
Unchanged idelalisib accounted for 23% of total radioactivity recovered in urine over 48 hours and 12% 
of total radioactivity recovered in faeces over 144 hours (see section 5.2 of the SmPC). 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
A tendency to less than proportional increase in exposure with dose was seen in ascending dose studies 
in both healthy subjects (17-400 mg) and patients with haematological malignancies (50-350 mg), 
especially on day 28. According to the PPK model, however, the relative bioavailability is essentially 
constant at doses in excess of 100 mg. No obvious time dependency was seen in the data, but time 
dependency has not been evaluated in the popPK analysis. 
Special populations 
A study of pharmacokinetics and safety of idelalisib was performed in healthy subjects and subjects with 
severe renal impairment (estimated CrCl 15 to 29 mL/min). Following a single 150 mg dose, no clinically 
relevant changes in exposures to idelalisib or GS-563117 were observed in subjects with severe renal 
impairment compared to healthy subjects (see section 5.2 of the SmPC). 
A study of pharmacokinetics and safety of idelalisib was performed in healthy subjects and subjects with 
moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) or severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment.  Following a single 150 
mg dose, idelalisib AUC (total, i.e., bound plus unbound) was ~60% higher in moderate and severe 
impairment compared to matched controls. The idelalisib AUC (unbound), after accounting for differences 
in protein binding, was ~80% (1.8 fold) higher in moderate and ~152% (2.5 fold) higher in severe 
impairment compared to matched controls. In samples from subjects with severe hepatic impairment, the 
plasma protein binding was lower than in matched controls (fraction unbound 11% compared with 6.7%) 
(see section 5.2 of the SmPC).

Gender, race or age were not found to be clinically relevant covariates in the population PK analysis on the 
exposures to idelalisib or GS-563117, including elderly subjects (65 years of age and older), compared to 
younger subjects (see SmPC section 5.2). There was a statistically significant association between 
exposure and body weight.

PK Trials 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Idelalisib is metabolised primarily via aldehyde oxidase, and to a lesser extent via CYP3A and 
glucuronidation (UGT1A4).  Its primary metabolite is GS-563117, which is not pharmacologically active.  
Idelalisib and GS-563117 are substrates of P-gp and BCRP. 
Effect of other medicinal products on idelalisib pharmacokinetics 
CYP3A inducers 
A clinical drug interaction study found that co-administration of a single dose of 150 mg idelalisib with 
rifampicin (a strong CYP3A inducer) resulted in a ~75% reduction in idelalisib AUCinf.  Co-administration 
of idelalisib with moderate or strong CYP3A inducers such as rifampicin, phenytoin, St. John’s wort, or 
carbamazepine should be avoided as this may result in decreased efficacy (see sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the 
SmPC). 
CYP3A/P-gp inhibitors 
A clinical drug interaction study found that co-administration of a single dose of 400 mg idelalisib with 
400 mg once daily ketoconazole (a strong CYP3A, P-gp and BCRP inhibitor) resulted in a 26% increase in 
Cmax and a 79% increase in AUCinf of idelalisib.  No initial dose adjustment of idelalisib is considered 
necessary when administered with CYP3A/P-gp inhibitors, but an intensified monitoring of adverse 
reactions is recommended. 
Effect of idelalisib on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products 
CYP3A substrates 
The primary metabolite of idelalisib, GS-563117, is a strong CYP3A inhibitor.  A clinical drug interaction 
study found that co-administration of idelalisib with midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A substrate) resulted in 
a ~140% increase in Cmax and a ~440% increase in AUCinf of midazolam due to the CYP3A inhibition by 
GS-563117.  Co-administration of idelalisib with CYP3A substrates may increase their systemic exposures 
and increase or prolong their therapeutic activity and adverse reactions.  In vitro, the CYP3A4 inhibition 
was irreversible, and return to normal enzyme activity is therefore expected to take several days after 
stopping idelalisib administration. 
Potential interactions between idelalisib and co-administered medicinal products that are CYP3A 
substrates are listed in Table 9 (increase is indicated as “↑”).  This list is not exhaustive and is intended to 
serve as guidance only.  In general, the SmPC for the other product must be consulted for the

CY2C8 substrates 
In vitro, idelalisib both inhibited and induced CYP2C8, but it is not known whether this translates to an in 
vivo effect on CYP2C8 substrates.  Caution is advised if idelalisib is used together with narrow therapeutic 
index drugs that are substrates of CYP2C8 (paclitaxel). 
Substrates of inducible enzymes (e.g., CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2B6 and UGT) 
In vitro, idelalisib was an inducer of several enzymes, and a risk for decreased exposure and thereby 
decreased efficacy of substrates of inducible enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2B6 and UGT 
cannot be excluded.  Caution is advised if idelalisib is used together with narrow therapeutic index drugs 
that are substrates of these enzymes (warfarin, phenytoin, S-mephenytoin). 
BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and P-gp substrates 
Co-administration of multiple doses of idelalisib 150 mg twice daily to healthy subjects resulted in 
comparable exposures for rosuvastatin (AUC 90% CI: 87, 121) and digoxin (AUC 90% CI: 98,111), 
suggesting no clinically relevant inhibition of BCRP, OATP1B1/1B3 or systemic P-gp by idelalisib.  A risk 
for P-gp inhibition in the gastrointestinal tract, that could result in increased exposure of sensitive 
substrates for intestinal P-gp such as dabigatran etexilate, cannot be excluded (see section 4.5 of the 
SmPC). 
Paediatric population 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
Plasma protein binding of idelalisib was assessed at substrate concentrations of 0.5 and 2 μM in mouse 
and rat and 0.5 to 20 μM in dog and human by equilibrium dialysis. Idelalisib exhibited moderately high 
plasma protein binding in all species with the free fraction ranging from 9.3 to 25.1%. The lowest average 
free fraction was observed in human plasma (~16% free). In mouse, rat, and dog the average plasma 
protein binding was comparable, ranging from 18.7% free (rat) to 20.8% free (dog). Plasma protein 
binding in dog and human was drug concentration-independent between 1 and 20 μM. Plasma protein 
binding of GS-563117, the oxidative metabolite of idelalisib, was assessed in human plasma at a 
substrate concentration of 10 μM by equilibrium dialysis. GS-563117 was highly protein bound with a free 
fraction of ~12%. In human plasma, GS-563117 was slightly more protein bound than its parent 
compound idelalisib (data not shown). 
For reports of hepatic metabolism and interaction studies, see above (special populations and 
pharmacokinetic interaction studies). 
In Vitro Assessment of Blood Distribution of Idelalisib and GS-563117 was submitted (data not shown). 
The purpose of this study was to assess the distribution of idelalisib and its metabolite GS-563117 
between the cellular and soluble fractions of blood. After incubation of whole blood from rat, dog, and 
human with idelalisib and GS-563117 (initial concentration 0.5 μM), the cell to plasma concentration 
ratios for idelalisib and GS-563117 were < 1.5 in all species, indicating that the compounds are not 
preferentially associated with blood cells. For idelalisib, the human blood to plasma ratio was the lowest 
(λ = 0.68) with the Sprague-Dawley rat and beagle dog showing more homogeneous distribution within 
blood (λ = 0.87 and 1.11, respectively). For GS-563117, the human blood to plasma ratio was also the 
CHMP assessment report

lowest (λ = 0.60) with the Sprague-Dawley rat and beagle dog showing more homogeneous distribution 
within blood (λ = 1.28 and 1.10, respectively). 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
See non-clinical aspects. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
The principal source of information regarding the shape of the exposure response relationship (PK/PD) for 
idelalisib is a sequential dose escalation study (101-02), evaluating idelalisib doses of 50, 100, 150, 200, 
or 350 mg BID, or 150 or 300 mg once daily administered as monotherapy to subjects with relapsed or 
refractory hematologic malignancies. The PK/PD was evaluated visually using box plots of changes in 
tumour size (SPD) from baseline stratified by quartile of idelalisib Ctau for subjects with iNHL and CLL 
respectively. These box-plots suggested that the median SPD response reached a plateau at/above the 
second Ctau quartile  for patients with iNHL and third Ctau quartile for patients with CLL and that the 
average exposure provided by 150 mg BID would be sufficient in both groups of patients (for further 
details see section 2.5.1) 
A single-dose PK/PD study placebo- and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) crossover study in 40 
healthy subjects to evaluate the effects of idelalisib (at therapeutic [150 mg] and supratherapeutic [400 
mg] doses) and metabolite GS-563117 on time-matched, baseline-adjusted, placebo-corrected QTcF 
(GS-US-313-0117). There were no relationships between time-matched, baseline-adjusted, 
placebo-corrected QTcF and idelalisib or GS-563117 plasma concentrations and idelalisib did not prolong 
the QT/QTc interval (i.e.,< 10 ms). 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Idelalisib is extensively absorbed, and in vitro as well as in vivo data suggest a moderate to high 
permeability. The terminal elimination half-life of idelalisib was 8.2 (range: 1.9; 37.2) hours and the 
apparent clearance of idelalisib was 14.9 (range: 5.1; 63.8) L/h following idelalisib 150 mg twice daily oral 
administration. If the patient misses a dose of idelalisib within 6 hours of the time it is usually taken, the 
patient should take the missed dose as soon as possible and resume the normal dosing schedule.  If a 
patient misses a dose by more than 6 hours, the patient should not take the missed dose and simply 
resume the usual dosing schedule. 
The effect of concomitant food intake on an early formulation was limited (t max increased from 0.75 to 3 
hours, 40% increase in AUC). The applicability of these data to the final formulation was discussed within 
the procedure. As the pivotal study was performed regardless of food, with at least one of the two daily 
administrations probably taken fed or semi-fed, a better estimate of the food effect on the final 
formulation was not expected to change the recommendations in the SmPC and thus a new food effect 
study is not required. No DDI study with acid reducing agents was provided despite the pH dependent 
solubility. It was however accepted that the clinical data provided did not suggest a major impact of 
concomitant use of acid reducing drugs, and this together with the relatively flat exposure-response 
relationship led to the conclusion that a specific study is not necessary.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/511776/2014  
Page 46/132 
 
 
 
 
 
Idelalisib is 93% to 94% bound to human plasma proteins at concentrations observed clinically. The 
apparent volume of distribution for idelalisib (mean) was approximately 96 L (see section 5.2 of the 
SmPC). The terminal elimination half-life of idelalisib was 8.2 (range: 1.9; 37.2) hours and idelalisib is 
mainly excreted in faeces. 
At 10 μM, idelalisib did not appear to be a substrate for the hepatic uptake transporters OATP1B1 and 
OATP1B3. This concentration was however substantially higher than the unbound Cmax (≈0.8 μM) and it 
cannot be ruled out that the transporters are saturated under experimental conditions. The applicant will 
investigate the substrate characteristics of idelalisib towards OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 at clinically relevant 
concentrations (see RMP). 
No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment or elderly 
patients (see sections 4.2 and 5.2 of the SmPC). 
From the hepatic impairment study, unbound AUC increased 1.8 times to 2.5 times in moderate and 
severe hepatic impairment, respectively in agreement with the average unbound concentrations 
presented for these groups. It is agreed that initial dose adjustment in patients with mild or moderate 
hepatic impairment is not necessary, but the SmPC describes the need for intensified toxicity monitoring 
of adverse reactions in these patients. There is insufficient data to make dose recommendations for 
patients with severe hepatic impairment and special caution should be taken when treating these patients 
(see section 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC). 
Considering the large effect (≥ 5-fold increase in AUC) seen on midazolam, which could be 
underestimated with the design used in the drug-interaction study, idelalisib is classified as a strong 
inhibitor of CYP3A4 (due to the CYP3A inhibition by GS-563117). Thus, idelalisib has the potential to 
interact with medicinal products that are metabolised by CYP3A, which may lead to increased serum 
concentrations of the other product (see section  and 4.5 of the SmPC). When idelalisib is co administered 
with other medicinal products, the SmPC for the other product must be consulted for the 
recommendations regarding co administration with CYP3A4 inhibitors.  Concomitant treatment of 
idelalisib with CYP3A substrates with serious and/or life threatening adverse reactions (e.g., alfuzosin, 
amiodarone, cisapride, pimozide, quinidine, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, quetiapine, lovastatin, 
simvastatin, sildenafil, midazolam, triazolam) should be avoided and alternative medicinal products that 
are less sensitive to CYP3A4 inhibition should be used if possible. 
Idelalisib showed a strong inducing effect in in vitro studies. Induction in vivo is not evident from the 
clinical data available. However, since the metabolite GS-563117 is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, CYP3A4 
substrates such as midazolam cannot be used to study induction in vivo. In addition, in vivo data on 
digoxin cannot be used since idelalisib is a Pgp inhibitor in vitro. Thus, the risk for idelalisib being an 
enzyme inducer of PXR regulated enzymes other than CYP3A4 in the clinical setting cannot be excluded. 
The applicant is recommended to conduct an in vivo DDI study with a sensitive substrate to a PXR /CAR 
regulated enzyme other than CYP3A4, e g CYP2C9. In addition, a weaker CAR mediated induction was 
seen in vitro, and the potential clinical relevance of this could probably also be elucidated with data on a 
CYP2C9 substrate. 
Given the induction signal in vitro and the potential teratogenicity based on the developmental toxicity 
seen in animals, the applicant will conduct an in vivo study of the effect of idelalisib on oral contraceptive 
steroids (see RMP). A steroid with as small contribution of CYP3A4 as possible should be chosen, to avoid 
effects of CYP3A4 inhibition. Until these data are available, the risk for decreased efficacy of oral 
contraceptives and the need for women using hormonal contraceptives to add a barrier method as a 
second form of contraception have been addressed in sections 4.4 and 4.6 of the SmPC. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/511776/2014

An inhibitory effect of idelalisib on CYP2C8 could not be excluded based on in vitro data. GS-563117 was 
found to be a time dependent CYP3A4 inhibitor. The applicant will submit in vitro data on the time 
dependent inhibition of other CYP enzymes (IC50 shift with pre-incubation) (see RMP).  
No effect of idelalisib was observed on digoxin or rosuvastatin in vivo. Since digoxin is not a very sensitive 
substrate for Pgp inhibition in the gut, the risk for inhibition of a more sensitive substrate such as 
dabigatran etexilate has been reflected in section 4.5 of the SmPC. 
Ketoconazole had a moderate effect (79% increase in AUC) on idelalisib pharmacokinetics in the DDI 
study performed. The design may not be fully worst case, and it cannot be excluded that the maximum 
effect of a strong CYP3A4/Pgp inhibitor on idelalisib exposure may be somewhat underestimated. 
Terminal half-life appears unaffected in the study, maybe because ketoconazole levels at later time points 
were too low to fully inhibit CYP3A4, but comparisons of the half-lives 4-12 hours revealed an increase in 
idelalisib half-life in the combination phase. A less pronounced increase in metabolite (31%) than parent 
(79%) exposure was seen, with no effect on metabolite half-life. This indicates that CYP3A4 is not 
involved in formation of GS-563117 in vivo; aldehyde oxidase is most likely the enzyme responsible for 
GS-563117. As the exposure-response relationship appears relatively flat, it is accepted not to adjust the 
starting dose when idelalisib is combined with strong CYP3A4/Pgp inhibitors, however section 4.5 of the 
SmPC was updated to include instructions that intensified monitoring of side effects should be given.  
Rifampicin had a large effect (75% decrease in AUC) on idelalisib exposure. Idelalisib exposure may 
therefore be reduced when co administered with strong CYP3A inducers such as rifampicin, phenytoin, St. 
John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum), or carbamazepine. Since a reduction in idelalisib plasma 
concentrations may result in decreased efficacy, co administration of idelalisib with moderate or strong 
CYP3A inducers should be avoided (see sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC). 
The applicant did not discuss potential interactions with other co-administered drugs in the clinical 
efficacy study 101-07 (bendamustine, ofatumumab, fludarabine, everolimus, bortezomib, and 
chlorambucil). By inhibition of CYP3A4, idelalisib could potentially increase the exposure of everolimus 
and bortezomib. If the applicant intends to apply for combination therapy with one of these drugs, the 
effect of idelalisib on the pharmacokinetics of the combined drug and vice versa should be investigated. 
Gender, race or age were not found to be clinically relevant covariates in the population PK analysis on the 
exposures to idelalisib or GS-563117. Although a statistically significant association between exposure 
and body weight was observed, it was found to have a relatively minor impact on the variability in 
idelalisib exposure. 
It is not known whether idelalisib and its metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the 
newborns/infants cannot be excluded. Breast feeding should be discontinued during treatment with 
Zydelig. (see section 4.6 of the SmPC). 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetic data in support of the approval of idelalisib is considered sufficient. The Applicant 
will conduct a number of post-authorisation measures (PAMs) to further clarify the interaction potential: 
- 
- 
- 
In vitro study of the effects of selective aldehyde oxidase inhibitors on the conversion of idelalisib 
to GS-563117 
In vitro study of the substrate characteristics of idelalisib towards OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 
In vivo interaction (induction) study with an oral contraceptive

- 
To conduct further studies on the human enzymology of idelalisib oxidation 
The applicant is recommended to perform an in vivo interaction study with a sensitive substrate to a 
PXR/CAR regulated enzyme other than CYP3A4, e.g. CYP2C9, address the potential of idelalisib to induce 
drug metabolising enzymes through interaction with PXR and/or CAR. 
Awaiting data from the planned studies, the lack of information has been reflected in the SmPC.

2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
Study 101-02: A Phase 1 Sequential Dose Escalation Study to Investigate the Safety, 
Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, and Clinical Activity of CAL-101 (GS-1101 
[Idelalisib]) in Patients with Selected, Relapsed or Refractory Hematologic Malignancies 
(final report). 
This was a conventionally designed MTD study conducted in patients with resistant/refractory 
haematological malignancies.  
Eligible subjects were administered idelalisib orally once daily or BID for 28 days (1 cycle, repeating 
continuously) or for 21 of 28 days (1 cycle, repeating continuously). Subjects were evaluated for response 
after 1 full cycle of therapy. Responding subjects or those with stable disease (SD) received additional 
cycles up to a maximum of 12 cycles (48 weeks).  
An extension study, Protocol 101-99, was initiated to enrol subjects who completed Protocol 101-02. 
According to the MAA, exposure to idelalisib reached a plateau at a dose of 150 mg BID and 
conventionally defined DLT/MTD was not reached (see the Pharmacodynamics).

Efficacy 
Table 13: Study 101-02: Clinical Response Rates by Disease (Safety Analysis Set) 
The two columns for CLL show ORR according the old and new NCCN CLL response criteria, respectively.  
A total of 191 subjects were enrolled in the study; 50 subjects (26.2%) completed the study (12 cycles of 
28 days each for a total of 48 weeks) and of those, 48 subjects (96.0%) continued into Study 101-99. 
Disease progression was the predominant reason for withdrawal from the study, reported for 88 subjects 
(46.1%).  
Study completion rates, i.e. 48 weeks of treatment without progression and without withdrawal due to AE 
etc., may be used as outcome measure together with ORR.  
The highest rate of study completion was among subjects with CLL (46 %, N = 54). Among subjects with 
iNHL (FL, SLL, LPL/WM, and MZL), 30% (N = 64) completed the study. Disease progression was the 
predominant reason for withdrawal from the study.

Among subjects with CLL across all dose cohorts, the percentage of subjects remaining progression-free 
at 48 weeks was estimated to be 54%. The KM estimate of median PFS among subjects with CLL receiving 
150 mg BID (N = 11) was 9 months.  
The median PFS among subjects with iNHL across all dose cohorts was 7.6 months. The percentage of 
subjects remaining progression-free at 48 weeks was estimated to be 46.3%. The KM estimate of median 
PFS among subjects with iNHL receiving idelalisib 150 mg BID (N = 10) was not reached.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint:  
• 
Progression-free survival (PFS) – defined as the interval from randomization to the earlier of the 
first documentation of definitive disease progression or death from any cause; definitive disease 
progression is CLL progression based on standard criteria [Hallek, 2008] and occurring for any 
reason (ie, increasing lymphadenopathy, organomegaly or bone marrow involvement; 
decreasing platelet count, haemoglobin, or neutrophil count; or worsening of disease-related 
symptoms) other than lymphocytosis 
Secondary efficacy endpoints: 
•  Overall response rate (ORR)  
• 
Lymph node response rate 
•  Overall survival (OS) 
Tertiary efficacy endpoints: 
• 
Time to response (TTR) – defined as the interval from randomization to the first documentation of 
CR or PR 
•  Duration of response (DOR) – defined as the interval from the first documentation of CR or PR to 
the earlier of the first documentation of definitive disease progression or death from any cause 
•  Best Percent Change in SPD of Index Lesions

•  Other categorical endpoints: Splenomegaly response rate, Platelet response rate, Hemoglobin 
response rate, Neutrophil response rate 
Other endpoints: 
• 
Exposure 
o  Study drug administration as assessed by prescribing records and compliance as 
assessed by quantification of used and unused drug 
o  Trough (pre-dose) and peak (2-hour samples) of GS-1101 plasma concentrations  
•  Safety 
Sample size 
Based on data from prior studies with rituximab, it was assumed that administration of rituximab to 
subjects with previously treated CLL in Arm B of this trial would result in a median PFS of ~6 months. An 
improvement in median PFS from 6 months to 10.5 months due to the addition of idelalisib to rituximab 
in Arm A of the study would correspond to a benefit ratio of 1.75 (hazard ratio 0.57). This treatment effect 
seemed achievable in view of the fact that the Phase 1-2 multicenter experience with single-agent 
idelalisib in heavily pretreated patients resulted in a median PFS of > 12 months. 
Randomisation 
Subjects were stratified to receive study treatment via IWRS based on the following stratification factors: 
•  17p deletion and/or TP53 mutation in CLL cells: either versus neither 
• 
Immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IGHV) mutation: unmutated (or IGHV3-21) versus 
mutated 
•  Any prior therapy with an anti-CD20 therapeutic antibody: yes versus no 
Blinding (masking) 
The identity of the treatments was concealed by central blinding of study drug assignments. Blinding was 
accomplished through use of a placebo that was well-matched to the active drug in appearance, 
packaging, labeling, and schedule of administration. 
Statistical methods 
According to Amendment No 3, two interim efficacy analyses were to be conducted after approximately 
the 60th and 90th PFS events had occurred in 220 subjects. The significance level for the 1st interim 
analysis was to be 0.001. 
The intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis set included all subjects who were randomized regardless of whether 
subjects received any study drug(s), or received a different regimen from the regimen they were 
randomized to. This analysis set was used in the analyses of subject characteristics, PFS, ORR, OS, and 
CR rate. The analysis of PFS based on the ITT analysis set was considered primary. Subjects in the ITT 
analysis set who did not have sufficient baseline or on-study tumor status information to be adequately 
assessed for response status were included in the denominators in the calculation of ORR and CR rate. 
CHMP assessment report

The per-protocol (PP) analysis set included subjects in the ITT analysis set who met the general criteria 
defining the target population for this study, were adherent to the protocol, were compliant with study 
drug treatment, and were evaluable for relevant efficacy endpoints. The PP analysis set was used in 
sensitivity analyses of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints: PFS, ORR, and lymphadenopathy 
node response rate.

Recruitment 
Table 15: Key dates for the second interim analysis of study GS-US-312-0116 
Conduct of the study 
Significant Amendments to the protocol: 
No 1: 23 January 2012 with revisions of eligibility and assessment criteria. 
No 2: 19 December 2012 with revisions of secondary endpoints, eligibility criteria, efficacy assessments, 
and update on study drug information 
No 3: 21 June 2013 with the addition of 2 formal [‘pre-specified’] interim analyses after ~50% and ~75% 
of the expected number of 119 PFS events (PD or deaths) had occurred, increase of sample size (from 160 
to 200), and update of idelalisib non-clinical and clinical results. 
No 4: 10 September 2013 with update on extension study enrolment, revisions of endpoints, response 
criteria and information on CYP3A4-dependent metabolism. 
Protocol deviations 
Out of 65 major deviations, 4 subjects were considered to have medically important deviations that could 
have potentially affected the results of the study and were therefore excluded from the PP analysis. Two 
subjects in the idelalisib + R group were excluded from the PP analysis (1 due to history of Richter’s 
transformation and 1 who had progressed longer than 24 months from the date of the last therapy). Two 
subjects in the placebo + R group were also excluded from the PP analysis (1 due to history of Richter’s 
transformation and 1 did not fulfill inclusion criterion #5).

Overall Response Rate (ORR) 
For subjects in the ITT Analysis Set who had at least 1 post baseline assessment (N = 176), ORR (95% CI) 
in the idelalisib + R group (N = 88) was 81% (71%, 88%), and for subjects in the placebo + R group (N 
= 88), the ORR (95% CI) was 13% (6%, 21%). The odds ratio (95% CI) for the ORR was 30 (13; 70).  
In the 2nd Interim, ORR (95% CI) (classified as CR or PR) for the full ITT analysis set (including 7 subjects 
with no postbaseline scans at this second interim analysis) was 74.5% (65.4%, 82.4%) for the idelalisib 
+ R group and 14.5% (8.5%, 22.5%) for subjects in the placebo + R group. The odds ratio (95% CI) for 
the ORR was 17.28 (8.66, 34.46), which favoured idelalisib + R compared with placebo + R (p-value = 
6.3 x10-19). 
ORR consistently favoured the experimental arm in subgroup analyses, thereby providing important 
support for the PFS analyses. This was unchanged in the 2nd Interim. 
Table 25: Overall Response Rate (Odds Ratios) for predefined subgroups (ITT Analysis Set) 
Time to response (TTR) 
The median TTR was 2.0 months for subjects treated with idelalisib + R (N = 71), with a range of 1.3 to 
5.5 months. The median TTR was 2.1 months for subjects treated with placebo + R (N = 11), with a range

of 1.9 to 8.5 months. In the 2nd Interim, median TTR was 2.0 and 3,6 months in the active and placebo 
arm, respectively. 
Overall Survival (OS) 
Figure 4 
As of the data cut-off, there were 16 subjects who died (idelalisib + R: 3.6%, 4 subjects; placebo + R: 
10.9%, 12 subjects) while participating in the study. In the updated results, 19 patients had died 
(idelalisib + R: 5.5%, 6 subjects; placebo + R: 11.8%, 13 subjects).

Lymph node response rate is defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve a ≥50% decrease from 
baseline in the sum of the products of the greatest perpendicular diameters (SPD) of index lymph nodes. 
For subjects in the idelalisib + R group, the LNR rate (95% CI) was 93% (85%, 97%) and for subjects in 
the placebo + R group, the LNR rate (95% CI) was 4% (1%, 10%). 
Ancillary analyses 
Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly response rates strongly favoured idelalisib + R over placebo + R (data 
not shown).  
The response in absolute lymphocyte count rate was comparable between treatment groups, and this was 
also the case for absolute neutrophil count (ANC) response between the two arms. Platelet and 
haemoglobin response were higher in the idelalisib + R group compared with placebo + R: 77% versus 
59%, 73% versus 37%, respectively. These results were not significantly changed in the 2nd Interim 
analysis. 
The 2nd Interim also included results on HR-QoL. The results show that in this population of elderly 
subjects with poor prognosis, advanced CLL, and limited treatment options, subjects receiving IDELA + 
rituximab consistently experienced statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in 
HRQL FACT-Leu measurements of physical and functional well-being (PWB and FWB, respectively), 
Additional Concerns  (a disease specific measure for patients with leukaemia) and the Trial Outcome 
Index compared to subjects receiving placebo + rituximab. In addition, subjects receiving IDELA + 
rituximab experienced statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in general health 
status as measured by the EQ-5D self-reported questionnaire visual analog scale (VAS) and utility index 
compared to subjects receiving placebo + rituximab. Subjects in the IDELA + rituximab arm rapidly 
achieved superior symptom control and their improvement was sustained. Based on the mixed-effects 
model (MEM) used to assess the between-treatment difference in change from baseline for all FACT-Leu 
endpoints, subjects on IDELA+R reported statistically significantly better improvement over time for PWB 
(p = 0.015), FWB (p = 0.014), Additional Concerns (p = 0.001), Trial Outcome Index (p = 0.002), and 
FACT-Leu Total (p = 0.006). Subjects’ symptoms improved rapidly by Week 2, and the median changes 
from baseline in the Additional Concerns subscale of the FACT-Leu and the ED-5Q Utility Index reached 
their MIDs of 4 by Week 6 and 0.06 by Week 12, respectively.

Study 101-07 
A phase I Study to Investigate the Safety and Clinical Activity of idelalisib in Combination 
with Chemotherapeutic Agents and Anti-CD20 mAb in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory 
Indolent B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, Mantle Cell Lymphoma or Chronic Lymphocytic 
Leukemia (interim study report) 
In this exploratory study idelalisib was combined with different medicinal products known to be active in 
B-cell malignancies: rituximab (R), ofatumumab (O), bendamustin (B), fludarabine (F) and everolimus 
(E) (only in mantle cell lymphoma).  
A total of 11 study centres in the United States participated in the study. 
Date first patient screened: 25-MAR-2010 
Eligibility: 
Subjects ≥ 18 years with a documented diagnosis iNHL (SLL, MZL, FL or MCL), previously treated with 
relapsed or refractory disease (according to a standard criteria) were eligible for the study. Subjects with 
CLL should show symptomatic disease that mandated treatment as defined by the IWCLL 2008 criteria, 
whereas subjects with iNHL and MCL should have measurable disease by computed tomography (CT) 
scan. All subjects were to show a WHO performance status of ≤ 2.

rates due to AEs were rather high in these patients with a median of about 3-4 prior lines of therapy.  
Eligibility criteria do not stipulate clear treatment indication for iNHL and MCL (only measurable disease 
that is relapsed or refractory). 
Data in patients with 17p deletion and/or TP53 mutation included in study 101-07 are presented in the

Study 101-08 
A Phase 2 Single Arm Study to Investigate the Safety and Clinical Activity of idelalisib in 
Combination with Rituximab in Elderly Patients with Previously Untreated Chronic 
Lymphocytic Leukemia or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (interim analysis) 
A total of 5 sites in the United States (US) participated in this study 
First subject screened: 28-SEP-2010 
Last subject observation: 22-MAR-2013 
Eligibility 
Patients ≥ 65 years with CLL or SLL Binet Stage C or Rai Stage III or IV or active and symptomatic disease 
and World Health Organization (WHO) performance status of ≤ 2. Patients should have had no prior 
therapy for CLL or SLL, except corticosteroids for symptom relief 
Experimental/treatment 
All subjects received idelalisib 150 mg BID orally on Days 1 through 28 of each 28-day cycle for 48 weeks 
and rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously weekly for 8 doses (Cycles 1 and 2). Subjects completing 
Protocol 101-08 with a clinical response following 48 weeks of idelalisib treatment were eligible to 
continue the treatment under a long-term extension protocol (101-99). 
Primary endpoint: ORR. A result of 70% ORR with the addition of idelalisib to rituximab was considered 
to be clinically meaningful for this study.  
The mean and median age was about 71-72 years with a range from 65 to 90. Altogether 1/3 patients did 
not complete 48 weeks of therapy thereof none for disease progression, but 17/64 for AEs.  
Of high-risk criteria, unmutated IGHV was present in a majority (58%) of the subjects, whereas only 14 
% were positive for TP53 Mutation/del (17p). 
Results 
Study 101-08/99 enrolled 64 subjects with previously untreated CLL, including 5 subjects with small 
lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).

Table 28: Overall Response Rate (ITT Analysis Set) 
The overall response rate of 97% is very high and included in this first-line elderly population CR in about 
14%. No subjects had a relapse while on the study.  
Forty-nine of 50 subjects (98%) had lymph node response. Two subjects for whom the response 
assessment was “not done” had withdrawn from the study due to dose limiting toxicity (Grade 3 rash, 
elevated ALT and AST and Grade 3 rash, respectively). The CR rate of 14 % indicates that BM biopsies 
showed remaining tumour infiltration. After a median follow-up of 14+ months, PFS data are immature, 
but there are no events of PD. 
Data in patients with 17p deletion and/or TP53 mutation included in study 101-08 are presented in the

indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas refractory to rituximab and alkylating agents (final 
primary study report). 
Methods 
Study Participants  
Main inclusion criteria: 
•  Karnofsky performance score of ≥60 (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] performance

CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/511776/2014  
Page 71/132 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of B-cell iNHL, with histological subtype limited to the following 
based on criteria established by the World Health Organization (WHO) 2008 classification of 
tumors of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues:  
o  Follicular lymphoma (FL) of any grade (not grade 3b; see amendment 1 below) 
o  Small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) with absolute lymphocyte count <5 x 109/L 
o 
Lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma/Mb Waldenström (LPL) 
o  Marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) (splenic, nodal, or extranodal) 
•  Histological materials documenting diagnosis of lymphoma available for review 
•  Measureable nodal disease, defined as the presence of ≥1 nodal lesion that measures ≥2 cm in a 
single dimension as assessed by CT or MRI 
• 
• 
• 
Prior treatment with ≥2 prior chemotherapy- or immunotherapy-based regimens for iNHL. 
Prior treatment with rituximab and with an alkylating agent (eg, bendamustine, 
cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, chlorambucil, melphalan, busulfan, nitrosoureas) for iNHL. 
Lymphoma that is refractory to rituximab and to an alkylating agent (review). 
•  Required baseline laboratory data within 2 weeks prior to start of study drug administration:  ANC 
≥1.0 x 109/L, Platelets ≥50 x 109/L, Haemoglobin ≥80 g/L total bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN, ALT and 
AST ≤2.5 x ULN, serum creatinine <1.5 x ULN, negative HIV and antibody and Negative HBsAg (if 
serology positive for infection), HCV Negative viral RNA (if serology positive for infection). 
Main exclusion criteria 
•  Known histological transformation from iNHL to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Biopsy 
documentation not required. 
•

•  Serious co-morbidity 
Treatments 
Idelalisib 150 mg BID. Lower dose levels (either Dose Level -1 [100 mg BID] or Dose Level -2 [75 mg 
BID]) were available for subjects requiring dose reduction. If a subject experienced an idelalisib -related 
AE requiring dose modification, study drug administration was held until the AE resolved or stabilized to 
an acceptable degree. Thereafter, idelalisib was readministered with the dose reduced by 1 dose level. If 
the subject tolerates a reduced dose of idelalisib for ≥ 4 weeks then the idelalisib dose could be increased 
to the next higher dose level, at the discretion of the investigator. 
Objectives 
Primary objective: 
• 
To evaluate tumour regression as determined by overall response rate (ORR) in subjects 
receiving idelalisib for treatment of indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL) refractory to 
rituximab and alkylating agents

Secondary objectives: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To determine the onset, magnitude, and duration of tumor control and of treatment success in 
subjects receiving idelalisib 
To characterize health-related quality of life (HRQL) as reported by subjects with iNHL receiving 
idelalisib 
To evaluate the effects of idelalisib on subject performance status

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint:  
•  ORR - defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved a CR or PR (or MR for subjects with WM) 
during the idelalisib treatment. The determination of iNHL response and progression will be based 
on standardized criteria1. Imaging-based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by clinical 
examination. CT or MRI scans are the required methods for tumor assessments. A BOR of CR, PR, 
SD, PD, NE, and ND was allowed. For subjects with WM, MR was also allowed. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints: 
•  DOR – defined as the interval from the first documentation of CR or PR (or MR for subjects with 
WM) to the earlier of the first documentation of PD or death from any cause 
• 
• 
• 
LNR – defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved a ≥ 50% decrease from baseline in the 
SPD of index lymph nodes  
TTR – defined as the interval from the start of idelalisib treatment to the first documentation of CR 
or PR (or MR for subjects with WM) 
PFS – defined as the interval from the start of idelalisib treatment to the earlier of the first 
documentation of PD or death from any cause  
•  OS - defined as the interval from the date of first idelalisib to death from any cause

Statistical methods 
This study tested the null hypothesis that the IRC-reviewed ORR was ≤ 20% against the alternative 
hypothesis that it was ≥ 39% (ie, ≥ ~40%). Using Simon’s optimal 2-stage design, a sample size of 100 
subjects had > 90% power to achieve a 1-sided significance level of < 0.005 and provided an adequate 
safety database. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Up to 125 subjects were enrolled in order to ensure enrolment of ≥ 100 subjects (31 in Stage 1, and 69 
in Stage 2) who had a documented diagnosis of lymphoma, who had confirmed refractory disease, and 
who could be evaluated for tumour response with baseline and on-study scans (through ≥ 24-week, 
follow-up tumour assessment).

Table 34:  Prior Therapy (ITT Analysis Set) 
The median (range) number of prior regimens received was 4 (2 - 12), with 73 subjects (58%) treated 
with 4 or more prior regimens. Among alkylating agents, 111 subjects (89%) had received 
cyclophosphamide and 81 subjects (65%) had received bendamustine. All subjects were refractory to 
rituximab and 124 subjects (99%) were refractory to an alkylating agent. 
Eligibility criteria in study 101-09 included no definition of “need for therapy”, except for LPL/WM. 
Baseline disease status shows presence of conditions requiring therapy (eg bulky disease, cytopenias, 
LDH>ULN) in ~85 % of subjects.

Analysis Sets 
The ITT analysis set includes subjects who received at least 1 dose of idelalisib (N = 125). The PP analysis 
set includes subjects in the ITT analysis set who had a diagnosis of lymphoma, measurable nodal disease, 
and who could be evaluated for tumour response with both a baseline and at least 1 on-study tumour 
evaluation (N = 123).

In the updated results submitted during the procedure, two patients had improved responses from PR to 
CR (not shown in table above) but the ORR was unchanged. ORR was consistent in subgroups by age 
(</≥65 y), gender, and race).  
Figure 6: Forest Plot of ORR and 95% CI – IRC Assessment, ITT Analysis Set 
From the updated results (09-SEP-2013) separate forest plots for the lymphoma subgroups have been

The number of subjects who had a CR or PR to their preceding therapy was 13 (10 %) and 16 (13 %), i.e, 
the ORR rate after idelalisib monotherapy was higher but the CR rate was lower. 
Secondary endpoints 
DOR 
The median DOR for all subjects was 12.5 months (12.5 months for SLL subjects, and not reached for FL, 
LPL/WM and MZL subjects). Analysis by age group showed moderate difference for subjects < 65 years of 
age and ≥ 65 years of age, median DOR was 12.5 months (n = 39) and 7.4 months (n = 32), respectively.  
Lymph node response 
Figure 9: Kaplan-Meier Curve of DOR – IRC and Investigator Assessments, ITT Analysis Set 
Among the 122 subjects with measurable lymph nodes at both baseline and post baseline, 67 subjects 
(54.9%) achieved a ≥  50% decrease from baseline in the sum of the products of the diameters (SPD) of 
index lesions.

Time to response (TTR) 
Figure 10: Waterfall Plot of Best Percent Change from Baseline in SPD – IRC Assessments, ITT Analysis 
Set  
The median TTR was 1.9 months as assessed by the IRC (n = 71) and the investigators (n = 72), 
corresponding to the first time response was evaluated (Study Visit 6, Week 8).  
The latest time point for achieving CR was 12.2 months (median time to CR 3.7 months, range 1.9 to 12.2 
months). 
Progression free survival 
Based on the IRC, the median PFS for all subjects (N = 125) was 11 months, the proportion of subjects 
remaining progression-free at 48 weeks was estimated to be 47%. Subgroup analysis (FL, SLL, LPL and 
MZL) suggests longer PFS in LPL, although this group was very small. 
Overall Survival 
The KM estimate of median OS was 20 months and the proportion of subjects surviving at 48 weeks was 
estimated to be 82%.  
Out of a total of 28 deaths, 19 occurred prior to Week 48 and 9 occurred after Week 48.

Of the 125 subjects in the study, 79 (63.2%) had a PFS ratio of > 1.0, that is, the individual subject’s PFS 
on idelalisib exceeded the PFS of the prior therapy and 57.6% had a PFS ratio of ≥ 1.3. Overall, the 
median PFS ratio was 1.5. There were 5 subjects with PFS longer than 18 months on last prior therapy and

clearly shorter duration of PFS on idelalisib. In three of these patients, treatment with idelalisib was 
stopped due to AEs. There were no other specific findings in their treatment history or baseline 
characteristics. For overall survival and proportion of survival at different times in study 101-09, there 
were no data per disease for the previous data cut-off of 25 June 2013. As shown in the table below 
comparing results from the two cut-off dates, the median ORR and PFS remain unchanged for FL and SLL. 
Concerning FL, the median duration of response (DOR) has now been estimated at 7.4 months (Q1, Q3: 
3.8, NR). This current estimation of the DOR in FL is thus lower than the overall value of 12.5 months 
estimated at the previous cut-off date for the whole group of 125 patients in the study. A summarized 
comparison of previous and updated results is presented below:

Results and Analysis  
Analysis description 
Primary Analysis 
Analysis population and 
The intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis set consisted of all subjects who received ≥ 1 dose of 
time point description 
idelalisib. The ITT analysis set was used in the analyses of ORR, PFS, OS, safety, and 
study drug administration and compliance. The ITT analysis set was the primary 
analysis set for all the efficacy variables (N=125). 
The PP analysis set includes subjects in the ITT analysis set who had a diagnosis of 
lymphoma, measurable nodal disease, and who could be evaluated for tumour response 
with both a baseline and at least 1 on-study tumour evaluation (N = 123). One subject 
had no baseline or on-study tumor assessment and 1 subject did not have documented 
refractory disease were excluded from the PP analysis set.

Only subjects who received or were randomized to receive (ie, Study 312-0116) at least one dose of idelalisib were included 
2.5.4.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
CLL 
Efficacy in CLL is based upon the interim report from the pivotal phase 3 study GS-US-312-0116 (n=220 
of whom 110 were exposed to idelalisib) in combination therapy and is further supported by two interim 
reports from single arm studies (101-07, and 101-08) in combination therapy and one final report from a 
monotherapy study (101-02/99). SLL patients enrolled in the monotherapy study 101-09 provided 
additional support, as CLL and SLL are regarded as two forms of the same disease. The total number of 
patients with CLL/SLL exposed to idelalisib and evaluable for efficacy in these studies is 397 (337 with CLL 
and 60 with SLL). 
It is accepted that patients with 17p deletion and/or TP53 mutation do respond poorly to 
fludarabine-based therapy and that this cytogenetic abnormality is an important prognostic factor, and 
hence the proposed stratification on deletion status of 17p and/or TP53 mutation status as a major 
prognostic factor is agreed upon. 
The design of the pivotal study and the choice of primary and secondary endpoints are considered 
appropriate and support an indication in previously treated patients not suitable for chemotherapy. The 
choice of the comparator arm seems reasonable as the use of single-agent rituximab has documented 
activity in patients with previously treated CLL. 
iNHL 
Efficacy in iNHL is based upon the interim report from the pivotal single arm study 101-09 in idelalisib 
monotherapy, further supported by data in the final report of the phase 1/2 dose finding study 101-02. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/511776/2014  
Page 86/132 
 
 
 
 
 
Additional support from combined therapy comes from the interim analysis of the phase 1 study 101-07. 
The total number of patients with iNHL exposed to idelalisib and evaluable for efficacy in these studies is 
269 (including 60 with SLL). 
The inclusion of a comparator arm in study 101-09 using Investigator’s best choice, might have allowed 
more direct comparisons, however, further to the SAG-oncology feedback, it was acknowledged that a 
randomized study is considered challenging in this disease setting. The size of the population available for 
clinical studies is limited and there is no single standard treatment option. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
CLL 
In study GS-US-312-0116 the efficacy outcomes all clearly favoured the experimental arm with a PFS HR 
of 0.18 and consistent effects in all reasonably defined subgroups. In addition, ORR data show that the 
activity appears unaffected by p53 and IgHV status. Early OS data also show superiority for the idelalisib 
arm, HR 0.28, p=0.003. 
Longer Follow-up in the experimental arm of GS-US-312-0116 (time to next treatment, overall survival) 
is of importance to show sustained major benefit. This follow-up will be provided by the applicant by Q4 
2017 (see Annex II and RMP). 
In study GS-US-312-0116, standard criteria for PD were used and results were assessed by IRC. Among 
subjects with either 17p deletion and/or TP53 mutation (n=95; experimental arm: n=46; control arm: 
n=49), results were in favour of idelalisib + R compared with placebo + R, with an unadjusted hazard 
ratio (95% CI) of 0.16 (0.07, 0.37). This is a significant improvement result for this high-risk 
sub-population, and its relevance is not diminished by the fact that the subjects in the study were 
previously treated. 
In study 101-08 the ORR of ~97 % in elderly untreated patients is also significant, and also the large 
proportion of subjects with 100 % resolution of enlarged lymph nodes. Here also, the results were 
consistent across subgroups of various risk factors for aggressive and refractory disease (e.g. 
del17p/TP53 and IgHV mutation status). 
After a median follow-up of 14+ months, PFS data are still immature, but there are no events of PD. 
Further follow-up is needed and will be provided post authorisation (see RMP). 
In study 101-07 the ORR of ~82 % in relapsed and refractory CLL patients for combination therapy with 
idelalisib is significant. The median KM estimate of DOR for subjects who continued treatment in Study 
101-99 was 23.9 (17.2, not reached) months. The rate of CR was however not better than for last 
previous regimen. 
Of special interest is the activity of idelalisib in patients with CLL and del17/TP53 mutations. The largest 
subgroup of patients with the del17p / TP53 mutations derive from the randomized rituximab 
comparative study (total 95/220 subjects, n=46 in the idelalisib + rituximab arm and n=49 in the placebo 
+ rituximab arm), with similar findings in studies 101-07 (n=24) and 101-08 (n=9). Less extreme but still 
significant results were observed in study 101-02, i.e. the dose finding study conducted in heavily 
pretreated patients. In this study the ORR was 53.8% and PFS at 6 and 12 months. were 35% and 17%. 
Front-line experience for idelalisib in del17p / TP53 based on 9 patients showing consistent results (with 
ORR and 6 and 12 months PFS of 100%). 
The combination treatment is considered appropriate for SLL patients based on the fact that SLL and CLL 
are different manifestations of the same disease, with SLL being the tissue equivalent of CLL  and based 
on the high response rate observed in monotherapy.

iNHL 
The applicant initially claimed approval in patients with refractory iNHL, however this indication could not 
be approved as it is not considered as a single disease entity if not supported by data showing a positive 
Benefit/Risk in all subsets of the condition covered by this umbrella term.  
In pivotal study 101-09 in patients with iNHL refractory to rituximab and an alkylator, the ORR of ~56 % 
of iNHL patients for idelalisib monotherapy is clinically significant. The median DOR was 11.9 months and 
exceeded the median DOR of the study population who responded to their last therapy (4.6 months). 
There was a good agreement of IRC vs. investigator assessments. Interestingly, there was no relationship 
between response and the degree of prior therapy or the frequency of refractoriness. For example, the 
ORRs were higher for those refractory to bendamustine compared to those who were not (59% versus 
50%), for those refractory to rituximab ≥ 2 times compared to those refractory ≤ 2 times (71% versus 
54%), for those treated with ≥ 4 prior therapies compared to those treated with < 4 prior therapies (62% 
versus 50%), and for those refractory to an alkylating agent ≥ 2 times compared to those refractory ≤ 2 
times (61% versus 54%). Thus, idelalisib has limited drug-related mechanistic cross-resistance. However 
the development of drug-resistance has been added as missing information in the RMP in line with the 
discussion held during the SAG-oncology (see below). The mechanism of drug resistance will be further 
investigated in studies for CLL and iNHL (see RMP).  
Duration of response (DOR) by age group showed moderate difference for subjects < 65 years of age and 
≥ 65 years of age, the KM estimate of median DOR was 12.5 months (n = 39) and 7.4 months (n = 32), 
respectively.  
Further to the CHMP request, ORR and other outcomes in study 101-09 have been presented separately 
for FL, MZL, SLL and LPL/WM. Results were comparable in all groups, but the numbers of patients were 
very different with n=72, 28, 10, and 15 with FL, SLL, LPL/WM, and MZL, respectively. 
The claimed indication did not reflect the line of treatment and the extent of refractoriness to previous 
treatments. This was addressed by the revision of the indication to reflect the predominant disease 
subtype of FL and refractoriness to two prior lines of treatment as investigated in the pivotal trial. 
In study 101-07 the ORR of ~78 % in relapsed and refractory iNHL patients for combination therapy with 
idelalisib is clinically significant. The median KM estimate of DOR was not reached, with a median 
follow-up time of 10.5 months.  
In the dose finding study 101-02 with idelalisib monotherapy, the ORR for all subjects with iNHL was less 
extreme (45.3%). Still, in relapsed and refractory iNHL patients, this represents significant activity.  
General CLL/iNHL 
For a more precise evaluation of the efficacy of idelalisib in CLL and iNHL, long term effects (overall 
survival, time to next treatment) will be reported post approval. 
Additional expert consultation 
Following the CHMP request, a Scientific Advisory Group meeting was convened on 10 June 2014 to 
provide advice on the following list of questions: 
1.  With  respect  to  the  proposed  indication  in  patients  with  chronic  lymphocytic  leukaemia 
(CLL),  concerns  were  raised  by  the  CHMP  as  in  the  phase  III  study  (312-0116)  the 
idelalisib + rituximab regimen has only been compared to rituximab alone. Therefore, the 
comparative  efficacy  and  safety  profile  of  idelalisib  +  rituximab  in  relation  to  other 
combination  therapies  requires  further  discussion.  In  particular  please  discuss  the 
following issues; 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/511776/2014  
Page 88/132 
 
 
 
 
 
a.  Criteria were set up in order to define a study population sensitive to rituximab but not 
suitable  for  cytotoxic  therapy.  However,  it  is  well  known  from  the  ESMO  guideline 
(Eichhorst,  2011)  and  clinical  studies  with  similar  design  that  a  large  proportion  of 
patients  fulfilling  these  criteria  nevertheless  will  be  given  chemotherapy  after 
progression  on  study  therapy.  Please  discuss  how  the  absence  of  a  rituximab 
+chemotherapy arm impacts the assessment of the benefit-risk balance for idelalisib in 
combination with rituximab. 
The CLL trial was conducted in a refractory population not suitable for chemotherapy as defined in the 
protocol. The size of the effect observed is unprecedented in this pre-treated and frail population (HR for 
PFS < .2). The activity observed in the subgroups of patients with 17p deletion and TP53 mutation was 
also important in view of poor responsiveness to conventional chemotherapy.  
For the proposed indication, the lack of a rituximab+chemotherapy control arm in the pivotal study does 
not raise concerns provided that the population recruited can be considered as truly unsuitable to 
treatment with chemotherapy. The criteria for defining patients unsuitable to chemotherapy (or suitable 
for non-cytotoxic containing regimens) as defined in the protocol were somewhat arbitrary and possibly 
too inclusive (e.g., CrCl<60 ml/min as the only criterion met for inclusion was in principle sufficient). 
Furthermore, it is questionable to define what patients would not qualify for treatment with chlorambucil 
or low-dose chemotherapy regimens and indeed post-progression data are unavailable to confirm 
(acknowledging the caveats of this type of analysis) how many patients were ineligible for further 
chemotherapy. However, the criteria broadly reflect clinical practice and are based on those proposed by 
the German Leukaemia Study Group (CLL-11). More importantly, the effect shown is convincing 
compared to what can be expected with available chemotherapy options with minimal toxicity. Therefore, 
the control arm in the pivotal study is considered acceptable. 
Uncertainties remain on how to further optimise the benefit-risk balance. Further data to explore markers 
of unresponsiveness, mechanisms of resistance, long term safety and drug combination therapy (versus 
monotherapy) will be of clinical interest to address these uncertainties. The applicant should investigate 
mutations in PIK3 delta signalling pathway kinase pathways and exome sequencing to pick up 
mechanisms of unresponsiveness and resistance. There are ongoing studies to address some of these 
possible markers for CLL (which is easier in terms of acquisition of tumour samples). Still, it would be 
useful to further study also FL based, e.g., on lymph node biopsies. 
b.  Given the results from the above mentioned phase III study, what indication would be 
considered clinically appropriate considering the patient population studied as well as 
the outcome of the study? 
The indication considered clinically appropriate is in patients with relapsed CLL, in combination with 
rituximab, in patients not suitable for chemotherapy. A definition based on number of prior treatments 
was not considered appropriate since depending on the duration of response chemotherapy options might 
still be considered beyond second-line. It is difficult to define “not suitable for chemotherapy” in more 
details and this is best left to the decision of the clinicians, particularly based on duration of first remission 
and other criteria such as those outlined in the pivotal trial. This will generally include patients for whom 
the toxicity associated with chemotherapy is of concern (not suitable for chemotherapy) or where 
non-cytotoxic treatments might be a preferred option, e.g., slowly progressive disease (suitable for 
non-chemotherapy containing regimens). 
2.  With respect to the proposed indication in patients with indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma 
(iNHL), the CHMP raised concerns in relation to the pivotal monotherapy trial 101-09 and 
the  proposed  indication  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  refractory  indolent 
non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL). Due to the immaturity of data (PFS event rate about 30%) 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/511776/2014  
Page 89/132 
 
 
 
 
 
the  Applicant  has  been  requested  to  provide  an  update  of  efficacy  data,  separately 
reported  for  follicular  lymphoma  (FL),  marginal  zone  lymphoma,  small  lymphocytic 
leukaemia and lympho-plasmocytoid lymphoma (Waldenström). Another concern raised 
by CHMP was that the study had a single arm, uncontrolled design. Please discuss;  
c.  How is the benefit/risk assessment of idelalisib monotherapy in iNHL impacted by the 
absence of a randomized reference, e.g. investigators’ best choice given the results of 
the study? 
The drug shows activity in FL however absence of comparative data makes it difficult to define the exact 
benefit in terms of clinical benefit endpoints. The response rate observed was high although the clinical 
relevance of this endpoint is questionable and PFS should be the preferred endpoint (Lugano Criteria, JCO 
2014). Intra-patient comparisons of PFS indicated an overall longer PFS on idelalisib compared to prior 
treatment (acknowledging the caveats of this historical comparison). Nevertheless, the response rate is 
even higher than that of rituximab in the salvage setting (acknowledging the caveats of historical 
comparisons including different definitions of response) and overall it can be expected that the benefit in 
terms of clinically relevant endpoints will be at least of similar magnitude. 
d.  What  would  be  the  estimated  outcome  (including  overall  survival  and  PFS)  of  an 
investigator’s  best  choice  regimen  based  on  clinical  experience  and  would  a 
comparative study have been feasible? To the knowledge of the assessors, no relevant 
data  in  relation  to  what  would  be  achievable  with  respect  to  treatment  effect  with 
currently  licensed  drugs  in  a  similarly  heavily  pre-treated  iNHL  patient  population  is 
available. 
Concerning the expected treatment effect of available options it is difficult to give precise estimates. 
However, the high activity observed allows concluding that the benefits are expected to exceed any of the 
available options and are at least of similar magnitude than rituximab in the salvage setting. 
In view of the recent experience, a randomized study is considered a challenge in this disease setting. 
This is mainly due to the fact that the size of the population available for clinical studies is limited and 
there is no single standard treatment option among the several dozen available ones that are used 
according to different investigator practices and individualised treatment approaches, which in turn would 
require large sample sizes in order to ensure sufficient power to detect important treatment effects.  
e.  Considering the patient population studied (mainly patients with follicular lymphoma), 
please discuss the relevant target population for treatment with idelalisib, e.g. patients 
with follicular lymphoma refractory to rituximab and an alkylating agent. 
The relevant FL lymphoma population for idelalisib monotherapy is patients with FL who are refractory to 
two lines of therapy. These are patients with multiple prior regimens fulfilling standard criteria for 
treatment and for whom high-dose therapies with curative intent are generally not appropriate. The need 
to explicitly mention rituximab and an alkylating agent was not supported as the best available therapy 
might include different regimens. SLL is considered part of the CLL indication according to current 
classification and should not be specifically mentioned under the monotherapy indication (although this 
raises the question about idelalisib monotherapy in CLL versus combination therapy, see uncertainties 
under answers to question 1a).

2.5.5.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Idelalisib showed consistent activity across subgroups based on previous treatment responses or 
prognostic groups within CLL and FL.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
• 
The applicant will submit the final study report for phase 3 study GS-US-312-0116, to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of idelalisib (GS-1101) in combination with rituximab for previously 
treated CLL by Q4 2017. Updates on PFS, OS and duration of response for patients with or without 17p 
Deletion/ TP53 Mutation and the whole population will be submitted in October 2014 and August 2015. 
The applicant will also provide the final data from the extension study GS-US-312-0117. 
• 
The applicant will submit the final study report for phase 2 101-09 study to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of idelalisib in subjects with indolent B-cell NHL refractory to rituximab and alkylating 
agents by Q3 2017. Updates on safety and efficacy results including overall survival and updates of the 
analyses of subjects with baseline lymphopenia, will be submitted by Q4 2014. The Applicant will also 
provide the final data from the extension study 101-99. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The integrated clinical safety evaluation is based on the pivotal monotherapy Phase 2 Study 101-09, 
supported by pooled monotherapy studies (101-02, 101-10, and 101-11) and the extension Study 
101-99. In addition, safety data from combination therapy studies (101-07 and 101-08) are provided.  
The safety analyses are further organized within each of these 2 groups into subjects with iNHL, subjects 
with CLL, and all subjects combined. 
Subjects Treated with Monotherapy 
•  Subjects with iNHL Treated with Monotherapy 
•  Subjects with CLL Treated with Monotherapy 
•  All Subjects Treated with Monotherapy 
Subjects Treated with Combination Therapy 
•  Subjects with iNHL Treated with Combination Therapy

•  All Subjects Treated with Combination Therapy 
Patient exposure 
iNHL Monotherapy: The median (Q1, Q3) duration of exposure for subjects with iNHL treated with 
idelalisib monotherapy (N = 200) was 6.1 (2.5, 11.5) months. The maximum duration of exposure 
approached 3.5 years. 
CLL Monotherapy: The median (Q1, Q3) duration of exposure for subjects with CLL treated with 
idelalisib monotherapy (N = 54) was 8.8 (3.1, 23.5) months. The maximum duration of exposure 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/511776/2014

exceeded 4 years. 
Subjects with iNHL Treated with Idelalisib Combination Therapy 
The median (Q1, Q3) duration of exposure for subjects with iNHL treated with combination therapy (N = 
80) was 10.0 (3.7, 23.3) months. Twenty-nine subjects (36.3%) continue to receive idelalisib (1 subject 
in Study 101-07 and 28 subjects in extension Study 101-99). 
Subjects with CLL Treated with Idelalisib Combination Therapy in Phase 1 and 2 Studies 
The median (Q1, Q3) duration of exposure for subjects with CLL treated with idelalisib combination 
therapy (N = 178) was 11.3 (6.6, 21.4) months. The maximum duration of exposure was more than 2.5 
years (33.6 months). Seventy-eight subjects (43.8%) continue to receive idelalisib (19 subjects in 
Studies 101-07 and 101-08, and 59 subjects in extension Study 101-99). 
Extent of Exposure Pivotal Study 312-0116 
Of the 220 subjects randomized in the study, 218 received at least 1 dose of study drug (idelalisib or 
placebo) as of the data cut-off for this report (09 October 2013), and were evaluable for safety. All 218 
subjects correctly received the study drug to which they were assigned during randomization. The median 
(Q1, Q3) duration of exposure to study drug in the idelalisib + R group was 5.0 (3.0, 9.4) months, with a 
range of 0.3 to 17.3 months. The median (Q1, Q3) duration of exposure to study drug in the placebo + R 
group was 3.7 (2.4, 6.5) months, with a range of 0.1 to 14.6 months. Mean study drug exposure based 
on person months on therapy was approximately 36% higher in the idelalisib + R group compared with 
the placebo + R group. Thus, mean exposure in the randomized 312-0116 study was significantly shorter 
than in the phase 1/2 studies.

For common adverse reactions, the treating physician is in the best position to grade causality. Without 
analyzing e.g., neutropenia and pneumonia in relation to response to the underlying disease conclusions 
as regards relatedness are hard to draw, the incidence of pneumonia is clearly high, however.   
The tables above indicate the possibility of a dose AE relationship for some SOC terms, but there is also 
an interaction between disease and duration of therapy to be taken into account.  
Adverse events in All Subjects Treated with Combination Therapy in Phase 1 and 2 Studies 
The most frequent AEs of any grade (reported for ≥ 20% of subjects) were diarrhoea (46.2%), pyrexia 
(43.4%), cough (34.5%), neutropenia (34.5%), fatigue (34.1%), nausea (32.4%), rash (29.7%), ALT 
increased (21.7%), and chills (21.0%). The incidence of AEs was generally notably higher among all 
subjects in the combination therapy group compared with all subjects in the monotherapy group. Many of 
the AEs in the combination therapy cohorts were consistent with the known AE profiles of the agents used 
in the combination therapies. 
Common Adverse Events, Subjects with CLL Treated with Combination Therapy in Phase 3 
Randomized Study 312-0116 
The most commonly reported AEs in the idelalisib + R group were pyrexia (34.5%, 38 subjects), 
neutropenia (27.3%, 30 subjects), and fatigue and nausea (each 25.5%, 28 subjects). The most 
commonly reported AEs in the placebo + R group were infusion-related reaction (29.6%, 32 subjects), 
fatigue and cough (27.8%, 30 subjects).

Adverse drug reactions 
Assessment of adverse reactions is based on one Phase 3 study and seven Phase 1 and 2 studies.  Phase 3 
study 312-0116 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which 220 patients with 
previously treated CLL were randomised 1:1 to receive idelalisib + rituximab or placebo + rituximab.  The 
Phase 1 and 2 studies assessed the safety of idelalisib in 490 patients with haematologic malignancies, 
including 354 subjects who received idelalisib (any dose) as a single agent and 136 subjects who received 
idelalisib in combination with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (see section 4.8 of the SmPC).

Transaminase Elevations 
iNHL monotherapy 
The incidence of any grade elevated ALT was 48.5% in altogether 200 patients. Twenty-seven subjects 
(13.5%) developed a Grade 3 abnormality and 10 subjects (5.0%) developed a Grade 4 abnormality. The 
incidence of any grade elevated AST was 42.5%. Twenty-one subjects (10.5%) developed a Grade 3 
abnormality and 6 subjects (3.0%) developed a Grade 4 abnormality.

iNHL Treated with Monotherapy (Safety Analysis Set) 
Among subjects with ≥ Grade 3 ALT or AST elevations, the median time to first onset of the event was 6.1 
weeks (range: 2.0 to 29.1 weeks). Nearly all events (36 of 38) resolved to ≤ Grade 1 levels. Among those

subjects whose elevations resolved, the median time to resolution was 3.3 weeks, and 75% had resolved 
by 4.5 weeks. 
CLL Monotherapy 
Among subjects with CLL treated with monotherapy (N = 54), the incidence of any grade elevated ALT 
was 18.5%. No subject developed a Grade 3 ALT abnormality and 1 subject (1.9%) developed a Grade 4 
ALT abnormality.  
All subjects in phase 1-2 combined therapy 
The incidence of any grade ALT elevation was 42.1%, the median time to first onset of the event was 6.1 
weeks (range: 2.1 to 13.1 weeks). Nearly all events (41 of 43) resolved to ≤ Grade 1 levels. Among those 
subjects whose elevations resolved, the median time to resolution was 2.3 weeks, and 75% had resolved 
by 4 weeks. 
In the Phase 1 and 2 studies, 2 subjects experienced AST or ALT > 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) 
concurrently with a total bilirubin > 2.0 x ULN and normal alkaline phosphatase. However, confounders 
were present that may have contributed to the elevations in transaminase and total bilirubin. According 
to the applicant, no case met the criteria for Hy’s Law. However, patients with active hepatitis were 
excluded from all the studies and thus constitute a population with missing information. 
Subjects with CLL Treated with idelalisib Combination Therapy in Phase 3 Randomized Study 
312-0116 
Transaminase elevations occurred more commonly in subjects in the idelalisib + R group compared with 
the placebo + R group. Most transaminase elevations were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity. The elevations 
typically occurred within the first 3 months of therapy, and were asymptomatic. Elevations (all grades) in 
ALT occurred in 38 subjects (34.5%) in the idelalisib + R group, with ≥ Grade 3 observed in 9 subjects 
(8.2%). ALT elevations (all grades) occurred in 11 subjects (10.2%) in the placebo + R group, with ≥ 
Grade 3 observed in 1 subject (0.9%). Elevations (all grades) in AST occurred in 27 subjects (24.5%) in 
the idelalisib + R group, with ≥ Grade 3 observed in 6 subjects (5.5%). AST elevations (all grades) 
occurred in 15 subjects (13.9%) in the placebo + R group, with ≥ Grade 3 observed in no subjects.  
Diarrhoea and colitis 
Diarrhoea/colitis is the most characteristic adverse reaction to treatment with idelalisib, especially colitis 
that occur after months of therapy and in the majority of cases (70%) not proceeded by reported 
diarrhoea grade 1/2.

Figure 14: Time to Onset of Diarrhoea/Colitis, All Diseases, Monotherapy (Safety Analysis Set). 
All Subjects Treated with Monotherapy 
Diarrhoea was the most common AE observed in all subjects treated with monotherapy (N = 352, 123 
subjects, 34.9%). Grade 3 diarrhoea was reported for 31 subjects (8.8%) and Grade 4 was reported for 
1 subject. Diarrhoea resulted in study drug discontinuation for 7 subjects. No relationship to dose was 
shown.  
Among subjects with diarrhoea of any grade (N = 117) in idelalisib monotherapy, the median time to 
onset was 1.4 months, whereas onset of more severe cases approximately 6-7 months. It is not 
sufficiently clear whether the symptoms of diarrhoea and/or colitis started with milder form and 
successively became more severe, or if it sometimes had a more acute onset.  
All Subjects Treated with Combination Therapy in Phase 1 and 2 Studies 
Among all subjects treated with combination therapy (N = 290), 134 subjects, 46.2%) reported diarrhoea 
of any grade. Grade 3 was reported for 38 subjects (13.1%) and Grade 4 diarrhoea was reported for 1 
subject. Diarrhoea resulted in study drug discontinuation for 15 subjects (5.2%). Colitis of any grade was 
reported for 27 subjects (9.3%); Grade 3 colitis was reported for 23 subjects (7.9%), and Grade 4 was 
reported for 2 subjects (0.7%). Ten subjects had ≥ Grade 3 colitis and ≥ Grade 3 diarrhoea.  
Colitis resulted in study drug discontinuation for 6 subjects (2.1%). Twenty-one (7.2%) SAEs of diarrhoea 
and 19 (6.6%) SAEs of colitis were reported; 1 subject had SAEs of diarrhoea and colitis. 
Diarrhoea SAEs From Phase 1 and 2 Studies 
In the total safety database of 642 subjects, altogether 66 subjects had at least one SAE reported as 
diarrhoea/colitis. For 44 subjects (6.9%) the more common aetiologies of diarrhoea anticipated for the 
study populations could not be readily identified and/or the subject had recurrence of diarrhoea upon 
rechallenge with idelalisib. 
These 44 subjects generally presented after several months of treatment with a history of several weeks 
of watery diarrhoea that responded poorly to antidiarrheal or to empiric treatment with antimicrobials. 
Idelalisib administration was interrupted during the serious diarrhoea event for almost all of these 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/511776/2014

subjects. Treatment regimens associated with resolution were varied, and included budesonide for 
approximately half of subjects. The median time to resolution noted from the discontinuation of idelalisib 
regardless of treatment approach was approximately 1 month.  
Of the 44 subjects, 13 subjects were rechallenged and diarrhoea recurred for 9 subjects following their 
first rechallenge.  
Patients with IBD were excluded from some of the major studies (notably 312-0116) which has been 
reflected in the SmPC. 
Diarrhoea in Study GS-US-312-0116 
In Study GS-US-312-0116 through the database cut-off for this report, 21 subjects (19.1%) in the 
idelalisib + R group had an AE of diarrhoea (any grade), and 4 subjects (3.6%) had events that were ≥ 
Grade 3 in severity (3 subjects with Grade 3 and 1 subject with Grade 4). Two subjects in the idelalisib + 
R discontinued study drug due to diarrhoea or colitis; the events resolved following study drug 
discontinuation in 1 of the 2 subjects. The second subject (6708-10230) died of fungal pneumonia and 
febrile neutropenia before the diarrhoea resolved (Appendix 16.2, Listing 3.3.5). In the placebo + R 
group, 16 subjects (14.8%) had diarrhoea of any grade, and 0 subjects had diarrhoea events that were 
≥ Grade 3 in severity. 
Rash 
In idelalisib monotherapy, 17 % of all subjects reported an AE of rash any grade. Among subjects treated 
with monotherapy (N = 352), grade 3 AEs occurred overall in 7 subjects (2.0%) receiving monotherapy; 
no Grade 4 events were reported. The proportion of subjects who had Grade 3 rash did not appear to 
increase over time. 
To further investigate the occurrence of rash in the idelalisib development program, a review of all AE 
preferred terms potentially related to rash was conducted for the complete ISS population. Grade 3 AEs 
in the rash MST occurred in 4 subjects (2.0%) with iNHL, no subjects with CLL, and 7 subjects (2.0%) 
overall receiving monotherapy; no Grade 4 events were reported. Discontinuations of study drug due to 
AEs in the rash MST occurred in 1 subject (0.5%) with iNHL, no subjects with CLL, and 4 subjects (1.1%) 
overall receiving idelalisib monotherapy. 
In study GS0116-312 eleven subjects 11 subjects (10.0%) in the idelalisib + R group had rash of any 
grade, and 1 subject (0.9%) had rash of Grade 3 in severity. There were no Grade 4 events of rash. In the 
placebo + R group, 5 subjects (4.6%) had rash, and the event was of Grade 3 severity in 0 subjects 
(Section 15.1, Table 3.1.15). Maculo-papular rash was reported for 3 subjects (2.7%) in the idelalisib + 
R group (1 event [0.9%] of Grade 3) and for 0 subjects in the placebo + R group.  
Pneumonitis 
Of the 7 SAEs of pneumonitis reported for all subjects on monotherapy in the Phase 1 and 2 studies, 2 
subjects had imaging results and clinical presentations more consistent with pneumonia: 1 subject was 
successfully treated with antibiotics alone, and 1 subject with severe underlying COPD quickly responded 
to treatment with antibiotics and a steroid. Of the remaining 5 subjects, an underlying aetiology could not 
be identified (eg, infection, malignancy) despite investigation with bronchoscopy. All 5 events resolved 
with steroid therapy. In these 5 subjects, the time to onset of pneumonitis from the first dose of idelalisib 
ranged from approximately 3 weeks to 1 year. All 5 subjects had prior exposure to a 
chemoimmunotherapy. Three subjects were rechallenged and none had recurrence of pneumonitis. 
In Study GS-US-312-0116 through the database cutoff for this report, 6 subjects (5.5%) in the idelalisib 
+ R group had pneumonitis of any grade, and 4 subjects (3.6%) had pneumonitis of ≥ Grade 3 in severity. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/511776/2014  
Page 105/132 
 
 
 
 
 
In the placebo + R group, 1 subject (0.9%) had pneumonitis, and the event was of Grade 3 severity 
(Section 15.1, Table 3.1.15). There were no Grade 4 events of pneumonitis in either treatment group. 
Subjects who were reported to have pneumonitis were confounded by underlying diseases such as COPD 
and chronic renal failure and concomitant medical events such as renal failure and deep vein 
thrombosis/pulmonary embolism. 
Infections 
In subjects treated with monotherapy, the incidence of infections and pneumonia was higher in subjects 
with CLL compared with subjects with iNHL. 
Table 50: Incidence of ≥ Grade 3 Any Infection and Pneumonia, Monotherapy (Safety Analysis Set) 
Grade 3 or higher infectious events were very common in patients with CLL, the sample size, however, is 
very small.  
In the randomised study in CLL, the incidence of pneumonia in the idelalisib + rituximab arm was more as 
expected (6%) and numerically lower than in the rituximab alone arm. The short duration of therapy 
should be considered. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
All subjects, monotherapy 
To date, 57 of 352 subjects (16.2%) treated with monotherapy have died: 35 of these subjects died while 
on idelalisib therapy or within 30 days of their last dose of idelalisib. Twenty-four subjects (6.8%) 
developed an AE leading to death. AEs leading to death reported for ≥ 2 subjects included the following: 
pneumonia (5 subjects, 1.4%), multi-organ failure (3 subjects, 0.9%), Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia 
(2 subjects, 0.6%), and septic shock (2 subjects, 0.6%). 
All Subjects Treated with Combination Therapy in Phase 1 and 2 Studies 
Thirty-three of 290 subjects (11.4%) treated with combination therapy have died: 26 of these subjects 
died while on idelalisib therapy or within 30 days of their last dose. AEs leading to death reported for ≥ 2 
subjects included the following: sepsis (4 subjects, 1.4%), cardiac arrest (3 subjects, 1.0%), pneumonia 
(3 subjects, 1.0%), dyspnoea (2 subjects, 0.7%), and pneumonitis (2 subjects, 0.7%).

Of subjects with CLL, 24 of 178 (13.5%) treated with combination therapy have died: 18 of these subjects 
died while on idelalisib therapy or within 30 days of their last dose.  
Deaths, Subjects with CLL treated with Combination Therapy in Phase 3 Randomized Study 
312-0116 
In Study 312-0116, 20 subjects died, nineteen during the study (through 30 days after the last dose of 
study medication), with a lower incidence of death observed among subjects in the idelalisib + R group 
(5.5%, 6 subjects) compared with the placebo + R group (12.0%, 13 subjects), and 1 additional subject 
who died after the study cut-off date.

Chemistry 
In the reporting of clinical chemistry, the CTCAE boundaries were given precedence, resulting in some 
reports of treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities that were in fact within the laboratory normal 
ranges. Discrepancies between the CTCAE classification and the laboratory normal ranges were frequent 
for triglycerides among subjects treated with idelalisib monotherapy.  
Mild to moderate increases in triglycerides and cholesterol have been detected and confirmed. Blood 
samples were not collected after fasting and causes of these changes have not been identified. Effects of 
idelalisib on lipid metabolism cannot be excluded.

Safety in special populations 
Study 101-08 was a dedicated older (>65) patient, single arm, interim reported first-line CLL/SLL study 
(n=64) combining idelalisib and rituximab. Qualitatively reported events were as expected similar but the 
event rate appeared higher. Diarrhoea (Grade ≥ 3) occurred in 17% and Grade ≥ 3 transaminase 
elevations occurred in 11%. There were 4 deaths, with the following causes: (1) pneumonitis, (2) 
pneumonia and metastatic melanoma, (3) sepsis, and (4) respiratory failure and pneumonitis.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
There were no dedicated PD interaction studies, with respect to PK interactions, see section 2.4.2. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Adverse events leading to idelalisib discontinuation were reported for 20% of all subjects treated with 
monotherapy, 23% of subjects with iNHL, and 15% of subjects with CLL. No single AE resulting in study 
drug discontinuation was observed in ≥ 5% of subjects. 
Table 60: AEs Leading to Idelalisib Discontinuation Reported for ≥ 2% of Subjects by PT and Decreasing 
Frequency, All Subjects Treated with Monotherapy (Safety Analysis Set)  
In the phase 3 randomized study 312-0116 there were no noteworthy differences in the incidence or type 
of AEs that led to discontinuation of study drug (idelalisib or placebo) between the two arms.  
Fifty-four of 352 subjects (15.3%) treated with monotherapy had an AE that led to dose reduction. No 
single AE resulting in dose reduction was observed in ≥ 5% of subjects.  
In the randomized trial, 3/110 subjects (2.7%) had AEs that led to dose reduction. The events were Grade 
3 pneumonitis, Grade 3 rash + Grade 1 maculopapular rash. None of the 107 subjects in the placebo +R 
group had a dose reduction of study drug due to an AE.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The total safety database of subjects exposed to idelalisib comprised 752 subjects. The two pivotal 
studies were conducted in “unfit” (=not suitable for chemotherapy) or heavily pretreated patients. A large 
proportion of the patients enrolled were elderly reflecting the age distributions of the diseases.  
Response to therapy occurred early, whilst time to progression was long, meaning that the incentive to 
continue therapy probably decreases over time and might be reflected in the rather high discontinuation 
rates, overall about 20%.  
The patterns of discontinuations were found to be different in the three described studies: for 101-08 a 
rather steady rate was observed during 12-15 months, in 101-09 discontinuations occurred primarily 
during the first 6 months, whereas in 312-0116 much lower percentages discontinued during the 
corresponding intervals. The overall lower number of drug discontinuations due to AEs in this trial (11 %) 
might partly be explained by the shorter duration of exposure as data cut-off was at the 1st interim 
analysis.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/511776/2014  
Page 116/132 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A potential factor in the higher rate of discontinuations in the Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies is the difference 
in the understanding of the idelalisib safety profile. As the idelalisib clinical program progressed from 
Phase 1 and 2 Studies (101-07 and 101-08) to the Phase 3 Study (312-0116), the approach for 
management of AEs by dose interruption and reduction was developed and Investigators gained 
experience in treating subjects with idelalisib, thus likely leading to a lower rate of discontinuation due to 
AEs in Study 312-0116. 
Elevations in ALT and AST of Grade 3 and 4 (> 5 x ULN) have been observed in clinical studies of idelalisib.  
These laboratory findings were generally observed within the first 12 weeks of treatment, were generally 
asymptomatic, and were reversible with dose interruption. Most patients resumed treatment at a lower 
dose without recurrence (see section 4.2). ALT, AST, and total bilirubin must be monitored in all patients 
every 2 weeks for the first 3 months of treatment, then as clinically indicated. If Grade 2 or higher 
elevations in ALT and/or AST are observed, patients must be monitored weekly until the values return to 
Grade 1 or below. Treatment with idelalisib must be withheld in the event of a Grade 3 or 4 
aminotransferase elevation. Once values have returned to Grade 1 or below (ALT/AST ≤ 3 x ULN), 
treatment can be resumed at 100 mg twice daily. If the event does not recur, the dose can be re escalated 
to 150 mg twice daily at the discretion of the treating physician. If the event recurs, treatment with 
idelalisib must be withheld until the values return to Grade 1 or less, after which re initiation at 100 mg 
twice daily may be considered at the discretion of the physician (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the 
SmPC). 
Cases of severe drug-related colitis occurred relatively late (months) after the start of therapy, 
sometimes with rapid aggravation, but resolved within a few weeks with dose interruption and additional 
symptomatic treatment (e.g., anti-inflammatory agents such as enteric budesonide). There is very 
limited experience from the treatment of patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease. 
Treatment with idelalisib must be withheld in the event of Grade 3 or 4 diarrhoea/colitis. Once 
diarrhoea/colitis has returned to Grade 1 or below, treatment can be resumed at 100 mg twice daily.  If 
diarrhoea/colitis does not recur, the dose can be re-escalated to 150 mg twice daily at the discretion of 
the treating physician (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC). 
Cases of pneumonitis have been reported in clinical studies with idelalisib. Patients presenting with 
serious lung events that do not respond to conventional antimicrobial therapy should be assessed for 
drug-induced pneumonitis.  If pneumonitis is suspected, idelalisib should be interrupted and the patient 
treated accordingly.  Treatment must be discontinued for moderate or severe symptomatic pneumonitis. 
Once pneumonitis has resolved and if re-treatment is appropriate, resumption of treatment at 100 mg 
twice daily can be considered (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC). 
Rash was generally mild to moderate and resulted in discontinuation of treatment in about 2% of 
patients. In study 312-0116, rash (reported as dermatitis exfoliative, rash, rash macular, rash 
maculo-papular, and rash pruritic) occurred in 13.6% of subjects who received idelalisib + rituximab and 
5.6% who received placebo + rituximab.  Of these, 2.7% who received idelalisib + rituximab and 0 
subjects who received placebo + rituximab had rash of Grade 3, and no subjects had an adverse event of 
Grade 4.  Rash typically resolved with treatment (e.g., topical and/or oral steroids, diphenhydramine) and 
dose interruption for severe cases. Treatment with idelalisib must be withheld in the event of Grade 3 or 
4 rash. Once rash has returned to Grade 1 or below, treatment can be resumed at 100 mg twice daily.  If 
rash does not recur, the dose can be re escalated to 150 mg twice daily at the discretion of the treating 
physician (see sections 4.2 and 4.8 and 5.3 of the SmPC).

Diarrhoea/colitis, sometimes severe, is the most obvious and clinically important side effect of idelalisib 
therapy. Of note, cases of colitis occurred sometimes after months of treatment and were in only 30% of 
cases preceded by grade 1/2 diarrhoea.  
To disentangle the roles of the underlying disease and therapy with respect to infectious events is 
frequently impossible, however, the overall pattern with also late events of pneumonia indicate that there 
is an at least possible causal relationship with idelalisib therapy. Cases of opportunistic infections 
(pneumocytis, fungal) have been reported. This is not at all surprising in the study populations. 
The incidence and type of SAEs reported for all subjects treated with monotherapy was very similar to the 
SAEs reported for subjects with iNHL. However, the incidence of SAEs reported for subjects with CLL 
treated with monotherapy was higher than for all subjects treated with monotherapy (66.7% and 49.4%, 
respectively). While pneumonia was reported for ≥ 5% of subjects with CLL treated with idelalisib 
monotherapy, febrile neutropenia, cellulitis, colitis, and pseudomonal bacteraemia were also reported for 
≥ 5% of subjects. 
In general, the causes of death reported in the idelalisib monotherapy and combined therapies appear 
heterogeneous as expected in these fragile patient groups. It is noted that the death rate in combined 
therapy in phase 1/2 (11.4 %) is lower than that seen in monotherapy (16,2 %), but study populations 
and differences in follow-up do not warrant direct comparison. No clear correlation is seen with AEs 
typically associated with idelalisib, e.g. transaminase elevations or diarrhoea/colitis. 
In the randomised study 312-0116, the death-rate in the placebo + R arm seems high, especially 
considering the short exposure, but may reflect the advanced stage and vulnerability of the study 
population. 
Idelalisib has not been studied in patients with chronic active hepatitis including viral hepatitis. Caution 
should be exercised when administering idelalisib in patients with active hepatitis (see section 4.4 of the 
SmPC). 
No patients with severe hepatic impairment were included in clinical studies of idelalisib. Intensified 
monitoring of adverse reactions is recommended in patients with impaired hepatic function as exposure 
is expected to be increased in this population, in particular in patients with severe hepatic impairment. 
No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment (see section 
2.4.2). 
Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Idelalisib has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines (see section 4.7 of the 
SmPC). 
Overdose 
If overdose occurs the patient must be monitored for evidence of toxicity. Treatment of overdose with 
idelalisb consists of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs as well as observation 
of the clinical status of the patient (see section 4.9 of the SmPC). 
Excipients: 
Zydelig 100 mg contains the azo colouring agent sunset yellow FCF (E110), which may cause allergic 
reactions. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the

2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The most frequent adverse reactions related to the use of the idelalisib are infections, neutropenia, 
transaminase increased, increased triglycerides and diarrhoea/colitis. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety: 
• 
see section 2.5.5 (the same measures that will address issues related to efficacy will be used to 
address issues related to safety). 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
legislative requirements. 
2.8.  Risk Management Plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 0.3 is acceptable provided that the applicant 
implement the comments raised in the report. The PRAC endorsed the PRAC Rapporteur assessment 
report attached. 
In addition, the CHMP requested the inclusion of additional non-clinical studies to further investigate the 
safety of the main human metabolite (GS-563117) considered as missing information in the RMP. These 
studies will consist of 4-week toxicity and toxicokinetic study in mice and a radioligand binding assay with 
GS-563117. 
The CHMP also requested the inclusion of mechanistic studies on the effect of idelalisib on immune 
function to evaluate available data on immunological effects and auto-immunity. 
The applicant implemented the changes in the RMP as requested by PRAC and CHMP. 
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 0.5 with the following content:

Transaminase elevation 
The SmPC section 4.2, Posology and method of 
administration, provides instruction for dose modification 
in the event of elevated liver transaminases: 
None 
“Treatment with Zydelig must be withheld in the event of 
a Grade 3 or 4 aminotransferase elevation (alanine 
aminotransferase [ALT]/aspartate aminotransferase 
[AST] > 5 x upper limit of normal [ULN]). Once values 
have returned to Grade 1 or below (ALT/AST ≤ 3 x ULN), 
treatment can be resumed at 100 mg twice daily. 
If the event does not recur, the dose can be re-escalated 
to 150 mg twice daily at the discretion of the treating 
physician. 
If the event recurs, treatment with Zydelig must be 
withheld until the values return to Grade 1 or less, after 
which re-initiation at 100 mg twice daily may be 
considered at the discretion of the physician (see section 
4.4 and section 4.8).” 
Section 4.4, Special warnings and precautions for use, 
states: 
“Elevations in ALT and AST of Grade 3 and 4 (> 5 x ULN) 
have been observed in clinical studies of idelalisib. These 
laboratory findings were generally observed within the 
first 12 weeks of treatment, were generally 
asymptomatic, and were reversible with dose 
interruption. Most patients resumed treatment at a lower 
dose without recurrence (see section 4.2). ALT, AST, and 
total bilirubin must be monitored in all patients every 2 
weeks for the first 3 months of treatment, then as 
clinically indicated. If Grade 2 or higher elevations in ALT 
and/or AST are observed, patients must be monitored 
weekly until the values return to Grade 1 or below.”

in the event of diarrhoea: 
None 
“Treatment with Zydelig must be withheld in the event of 
Grade 3 or 4diarrhoea/colitis. Once diarrhoea/colitis has 
returned to Grade 1 or below, treatment can be resumed 
at 100 mg twice daily. If diarrhoea/colitis does not recur, 
the dose can be re-escalated to 150 mg twice daily at the 
discretion of the treating physician (see section 4.8).” 
Section 4.4, Special warnings and precautions for use, 
states: 
“Cases of severe drug-related colitis occurred relatively 
late (months) after the start of therapy sometimes with 
rapid aggravation, but  resolved within a few weeks with 
dose interruption and additional symptomatic treatment 
(e.g., anti-inflammatory agents such as enteric 
budesonide). 
There is very limited experience from the treatment of 
patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease.” 
Section 4.8, Undesirable effects, lists “Diarrhoea/colitis” 
as a very common (≥ 10%) adverse drug reaction. 
Pneumonitis 
The SmPC, section 4.2, Posology and method of 
administration, states: “Treatment with Zydelig must be 
withheld in the event of suspected pneumonitis.  Once 
pneumonitis has resolved and if re-treatment is 
appropriate, resumption of treatment at 100 mg twice 
daily can be considered (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).”

lung events that do not respond to conventional 
antimicrobial therapy should be assessed for 
drug-induced pneumonitis. If pneumonitis is suspected, 
idelalisib should be interrupted and the patient treated 
accordingly. Treatment must be discontinued for 
moderate or severe symptomatic pneumonitis.”  
Section 4.8, Undesirable effects, lists “pneumonitis” as a 
common (≥ 1%) adverse drug reaction.  
The SmPC Section 4.8, Undesirable effects, lists 
“neutropenia” as a very common (≥ 10%) adverse drug

(see section 5.3 phototoxicity).” 
Important potential 
risk(s) 
Reproductive toxicity 
including teratogenicity 
Section 4.4, Special warnings and precautions for use 
states: 
None 
“Women of childbearing potential must use highly 
effective contraception while taking idelalisib and for 
1-month after stopping treatment (see section 4.6). 
Women using hormonal contraceptives should add a 
barrier method as a second form of contraception since it 
is currently unknown whether idelalisib may reduce the 
effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives.” 
The SmPC Section 4.6, Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
states: 
“Women of childbearing potential: Based on findings in 
animals, idelalisib may cause foetal harm.  Women should 
avoid becoming pregnant while taking Zydelig, and for up 
to 1 month after ending treatment. Therefore, women of 
childbearing potential must use highly effective 
contraception while taking Zydelig and for 1 month after 
stopping treatment. It is currently unknown whether 
idelalisib may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal 
contraceptives, and therefore women using hormonal 
contraceptives should add a barrier method as a second 
form of contraception. 
Pregnancy: There are no or limited amount of data from 
the use of idelalisib in pregnant women. Studies in 
animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 
5.3). Zydelig is not recommended during pregnancy and 
in women of childbearing potential not using 
contraception. 
Fertility: No human data on the effect of idelalisib on 
fertility are available. Animal studies indicate the potential 
for harmful effects of idelalisib on fertility and foetal 
development (see section 5.3).” 
Section 5.3, Preclinical safety data states under 
“Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity”: 
“In an embryo-foetal development study in rats, 
increased post-implantation loss, malformations 
(absence of caudal vertebrae and in some cases also of 
sacral vertebrae), skeletal variations and lower foetal 
body weights were observed. Malformations were 
observed at exposures from 12 times the human 
exposure based on AUC. Effects on embryo-foetal 
development were not investigated in a second species. 
Degeneration of the seminiferous tubules in the testes 
was observed in 2- to 13-week repeated dose studies in

dogs and rats, but not in studies of 26 weeks and longer 
duration. In a rat male fertility study, decreases in 
epididymides and testes weight were observed but no 
adverse effects on mating or fertility parameters, and no 
degeneration or loss in spermatogenesis were observed. 
Female fertility was not affected in rats.” 
The SmPC, section 4.4, Special warnings and precautions 
for use states “CYP3A inducers: Idelalisib exposure may 
be reduced when co-administered with CYP3A inducers 
such as rifampicin, phenytoin, St. John’s wort (Hypericum 
perforatum), or carbamazepine.  Since a reduction in 
idelalisib plasma concentrations may result in decreased 
efficacy, co-administration of Zydelig with moderate or 
strong CYP3A inducers should be avoided (see 
section 4.5).” 
The SmPC, section 4.5, Interaction with other medicinal 
products and other forms of interaction, recommend to 
avoid co-administration of IDELA with strong CYP3A 
inducers: 
“CYP3A Inducers: A clinical drug interaction study found 
that co-administration of a single dose of 150 mg 
idelalisib with rifampicin (a strong CYP3A inducer) 
resulted in a ~75% reduction in idelalisib AUCinf. 
Co-administration of Zydelig with moderate or strong 
CYP3A inducers such as rifampicin, phenytoin, St. John’s 
wort, or carbamazepine should be avoided as this may 
result in decreased efficacy (see section 4.4).”  
The SmPC, section 4.4, Special warnings and precautions 
for use, states “The primary metabolite of idelalisib, 
GS-563117, is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor. Thus, idelalisib 
has the potential to interact with medicinal products that 
are metabolised by CYP3A, which may lead to increased 
serum concentrations of the other product (see 
section  4.5). When idelalisib is co-administered with 
other medicinal products, the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) for the other product must be 
consulted for the recommendations regarding 
co-administration with CYP3A4 inhibitors. Concomitant 
treatment of idelalisib with CYP3A substrates with serious 
and/or life-threatening side effects (e.g., alfuzosin, 
amiodarone, cisapride, pimozide, quinidine, ergotamine, 
dihydroergotamine, quetiapine, lovastatin, simvastatin, 
sildenafil, midazolam, triazolam) should be avoided and 
alternative medicinal products that are less sensitive to 
CYP3A4 inhibition should be used if possible.”  
The SmPC, section 4.5, Interaction with other medicinal 
products and other forms of interaction, recommended 
caution if Zydelig is co-administered with CYP3A 
substrates: 
“CYP3A Substrates: The primary metabolite of idelalisib, 
GS-563117, is a strong CYP3A inhibitor. A clinical drug 
interaction study found that co-administration of idelalisib 
with midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A substrate) resulted in 
a ~140% increase in Cmax and a ~440% increase in AUCinf 
of midazolam due to the CYP3A inhibition by GS-563117.  
Co-administration of idelalisib with CYP3A substrates may 
increase their systemic exposures and increase or prolong 
their therapeutic activity and adverse reactions.  In vitro, 
the CYP3A4 inhibition was irreversible, and return to 
normal enzyme activity is therefore expected to take 
several days after stopping idelalisib administration.

Safety in patients with severe

co-administered medicinal products that are CYP3A 
substrates are listed in Table 1 (increase is indicated as 
“↑”). This list is not exhaustive and is intended to serve as 
guidance only. In general, the SmPC for the other product 
must be consulted for the recommendations regarding 
co-administration with CYP3A4 inhibitors (see 
section 4.4).” 
The SmPC section 5.3, Preclinical safety data states 
“Evaluation of the potential for phototoxicity in the 
embryonic murine fibroblast cell line BALB/c 3T3 was 
inconclusive for idelalisib due to cytotoxicity in the in vitro 
assay. The major metabolite, GS-563117, may enhance

The SmPC sections 4.2, states: 
“No dose adjustment is required when initiating treatment 
with Zydelig in patients with mild or moderate hepatic 
impairment, but an intensified monitoring of adverse 
reactions is recommended (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
There is insufficient data to make dose recommendations 
for patients with severe hepatic impairment. Therefore, 
caution is recommended when administering Zydelig in 
this population and an intensified monitoring of adverse 
reactions is recommended (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).” 
The SmPC, section 4.4, states: 
“Intensified monitoring of adverse reactions is 
recommended in patients with impaired hepatic function 
as exposure is expected to be increased in this population, 
in particular in patients with severe hepatic impairment.  
No patients with severe hepatic impairment were included 
in clinical studies of idelalisib. Caution is recommended 
when administering Zydelig in this population.” 
The SmPC, section 5.2, states: 
“A study of pharmacokinetics and safety of idelalisib was 
performed in healthy subjects and subjects with 
moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) or severe (Child-Pugh 
Class C) hepatic impairment. Following a single 150 mg 
dose, idelalisib overall (i.e., bound plus unbound) AUC 
was ~60% higher in moderate and severe impairment 
compared to matched controls, which is not considered to 
be clinically relevant. The idelalisib AUC (unbound), after 
accounting for differences in protein binding, was ~80% 
(1.8-fold) higher in moderate and ~152% (2.5-fold)

“The safety and efficacy of Zydelig in children under the 
age of 18 years have not been established. No data are 
available.” 
Safety of breastfeeding 
The SmPC sections 4.6, states: 
None 
“It is unknown whether idelalisib and its metabolites are 
excreted in human milk. 
A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. 
A decision must be made whether to discontinue 
breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Zydelig 
therapy taking into account the benefit of breast- feeding 
for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.” 
Drug-drug interaction with

The SmPC section 4.4, Special warnings and precautions 
for use states: 
None 
“Women of childbearing potential must use highly 
effective contraception while taking idelalisib and for 
1-month after stopping treatment (see section 4.6).  
Women using hormonal contraceptives should add a 
barrier method as a second form of contraception since it 
is currently unknown whether idelalisib may reduce the 
effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives.” 
The SmPC section 4.6, Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
states: 
“Based on findings in animals, idelalisib may cause foetal 
harm.  Women should avoid becoming pregnant while 
taking Zydelig, and for up to 1 month after ending 
treatment.  Therefore, women of childbearing potential 
must use highly effective contraception while taking 
Zydelig and for 1 month after stopping treatment.  It is 
currently unknown whether idelalisib may reduce the 
effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives, and therefore 
women using hormonal contraceptives should add a 
barrier method as a second form of contraception.” 
2.9.  Product information/User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
CLL/SLL: Idelalisib plus rituximab in patients with CLL not suitable for chemotherapy was associated with 
a PFS HR of 0.18 compared to placebo+rituximab. In secondary analyses, OS data also showed a 
favourable effect for the idelalisib arm, with a HR of 0.28. There was also an ongoing first-line single arm 
study in elderly patients (101-08; n=64) with the same combination showing high activity (ORR 62/64). 
The development program for idelalisib in CLL has to date reported on clinical outcomes from 153 subjects 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/511776/2014  
Page 128/132 
 
 
 
 
 
with either 17p deletion or TP53 mutation. The largest subgroup of patients with the del17p / TP53 
mutations derive from the randomized rituximab comparative study (n=46, ORR 78%, PFS at 6 months 
87%, at 1 year 71% in the idelalisib + rituximab arm; n=49 in the placebo + rituximab arm ), fully in-line 
with the findings in studies 101-07 (n=24) and 101-08 (n=9).  
Monotherapy data derive from a small number of patients in single arm studies with variable degree of 
resistance to prior therapy. The number of patients is too small to support a monotherapy indication. 
FL: In a single arm idelalisib monotherapy study conducted in patients with iNHL refractory to rituximab 
and an alkylator, an ORR of ~56%, a PFS rate of 47% (95% CI 36; 58%) at 48 weeks and a duration of 
response of about 12 months were observed. In the subgroup follicular lymphoma (n=72), ORR was 
54.2% and median DOR was found to be about 7.4 months. 
Activity was seemingly unrelated to number of prior regimens in this heavily pretreated patient population 
with large proportions of patients refractory not only to rituximab and an alkylator, but to most lymphoma 
drugs, including bendamustin (n=62).  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
The pivotal CLL study (i.e 312-0116) was terminated early due to efficacy. There are thus no data on long 
term efficacy. The magnitude of the treatment effect is therefore not well defined and further follow-up is 
needed. Further long-term data will be submitted by the applicant within updates of study 312-0116 and 
as part of the extension study 312-0117 (see annex II of the opinion and RMP). 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The most common side effects are infections, neutropenia, increased transaminase, increased 
triglycerides, diarrhoea/colitis, rash and pyrexia. 
Idelalisib is classified as a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, thus affecting the pharmacokinetics of CYP3A4 
substrates. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Whether the major metabolite GS-563117 contributes to adverse reactions by inhibition of lymphocyte 
oriented (LOK) and/or Ste20-like kinases (SLK) is unknown and there are currently no non-clinical data 
guiding the search for target organs of toxicity. The applicant will conduct a 4-week toxicology study in 
mice and a radioligand binding assay to further investigate the safety of the metabolite. 
Autoimmune phenomena are commonly reported in lymphoproliferative diseases, especially in CLL. Due 
to its immune modulating effects, potential consequences of idelalisib therapy are of interest, but until 
now no signal has been identified, fully acknowledging that the pathophysiology behind colitis remains 
unexplained. The applicant has outlined a study program including in vitro evaluation of the effect of 
idealisib on T-cell proliferation, cytokine production and specific studies with regulatory T-cells (see RMP).   
Due to the early interim analysis, median duration of exposure is about 5 months in the idelalisib + 
rituximab arm of the pivotal CLL study. Since long treatment duration is expected in clinical practice, the 
applicant has committed to submit the results of a number of ongoing studies in order to address the 
missing information of long-term safety of idelalisib (see RMP). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/511776/2014

Plasma exposure is higher in patients with moderate hepatic impairment and ALT/AST increase is 
common. This implies uncertainty as regards liver safety in this population. A warning recommending 
intensified monitoring in patients with impaired hepatic function has been included in section 4.4 of the 
SmPC.  
CLL is associated with an increased incidence of skin cancer assumed to be related to immune suppressive 
effects of the disease and treatment, e.g. with alkylating agents. Due to the immune modulating effects 
of idelalisib, skin cancer has been listed as an important potential risk in the RMP and events will be 
addressed as events of special interest in ongoing and future clinical trials (see RMP).  
Non-clinical data indicate a potential for phototoxicity and it is noted that there was one case reported as 
Grade 2 photosensitivity in a subject on combination therapy and one case in monotherapy study 101-02 
described as sunburn. The need for in vitro photoxicity studies and the potential risk of photosensitivity 
have been included in the SmPC and the RMP. 
Co-administration with ketoconazole resulted in a moderate increase in idelalisib AUCinf (about 80%). As 
the exposure-response relationship appears relatively flat, it is accepted not to adjust the starting dose 
when idelalisib is combined with strong CYP3A4/Pgp inhibitors, however section 4.5 of the SmPC was 
updated to include instructions that intensified monitoring of side effects should be given.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The results from studies conducted in the CLL indication are of high clinical relevance. The activity of 
idelalisib was demonstrated across trials. The positive results in the high risk patients with del17p / TP53 
mutations are of particular importance and support an indication in first line for those patients who are 
unsuitable for chemo-immunotherapy. 
Convincing and clinically relevant results were observed in patients with follicular lymphoma treated with 
idelalisib monotherapy. Although the pivotal study is a single arm study, the activity seen in terms of ORR, 
and DOR is considered sufficiently important and at least as clinically significant as with other available 
options in this heavily pre-treated patient population to support approval. 
Discontinuation due to toxicity was infrequent and overall the toxicity was considered manageable. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The important benefits observed in the two indications outweigh the risks related to the use of idelalisib. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Of major importance in the assessment of benefit is the consistently shown high activity of idelalisib 
irrespective of refractoriness to prior therapy or unfavourable prognostic factors in patients with FL and 
CLL.  
The high response rates and long durations of response at acceptable toxicity are acknowledged, 
although the long-term data  are not yet available. As a consequence, efficacy and safety data from 
ongoing studies will be regularly updated to provide additional information about long-term benefits and 
risks. 
CLL: The indication for use as combination therapy with rituximab in relapsed CLL is acceptable 
considering that patients after 1 line of therapy as well as after 2 or more lines of therapy could be 
included in the pivotal study.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/511776/2014  
Page 130/132 
 
 
 
 
 
In patients with del17p/TP53 mutations the activity appears similar to available fludarabine or 
alemtuzumab combination regimens. As these regimens are too toxic for large proportions of patients, 
benefit-risk is considered clearly favourable for patients non-suitable for immuno-chemotherapy in case 
of mutations del17p/TP53, regardless of prior treatment experience.  
iNHL:  
The applicant initially claimed approval in patients with refractory iNHL, however this indication could not 
be approved as it is not considered as a single disease entity if not supported by data showing a positive 
Benefit/Risk in all subsets of the condition covered by this umbrella term. 
However, the Benefit/risk of Zydelig as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with follicular 
lymphoma (a subset of iNHL) that is refractory to two prior lines of treatment is considered positive by the 
CHMP. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Zydelig is not similar to Arzerra, Gazyvaro and Litak within 
the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the risk-benefit balance of Zydelig in combination with rituximab for the treatment of adult patients with 
chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL): 
• 
• 
who have received at least one prior therapy, or 
as first line treatment in the presence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutation in patients unsuitable for 
chemo-immunotherapy. 
Zydelig is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) that 
is refractory to two prior lines of treatment.

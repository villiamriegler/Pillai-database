COMP opinion (adoption via written 
21 July 2023 
procedure) 
2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 2021 designation was 
based on the following grounds: 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing talquetamab was 
considered justified based on preclinical data showing that patients with relapsed or refractory 
multiple myeloma achieve partial or complete responses; 
the condition is chronically debilitating and life-threatening due to the development of 
hypercalcaemia, renal insufficiency, anaemia and bone lesions;   
the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 4.3 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made. 
In addition, although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition exist in the European Union, 
the sponsor has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the medicinal product 
containing talquetamab will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. The sponsor has 
provided clinical data that demonstrate that patients with relapsed and penta-refractory multiple 
myeloma previously treated with selinexor and belantamab mafodotin achieved partial and stringent 
complete responses. The Committee considered that this constitutes a clinically relevant advantage. 
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation  
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Multiple myeloma (MM; also called plasma cell myeloma) is a malignant neoplasm of plasma cells that 
clonally expand and accumulate in the bone marrow and/or extramedullary sites, leading to bone 
destruction, infections, renal insufficiency, and marrow failure (Dimopoulos et al., 2015). The disease 
is often asymptomatic for a long period of time and often advanced at the time of diagnosis (Rajkumar 
et al., 2014). MM is most frequently diagnosed among people older than 65 years of age and the 
median age at onset in Europe is 72 years. The incidence rates increase with age, particularly after the 
age of 40 years, and men are more likely to develop the disease than women with a ratio of around 
3:2. The aetiology is unknown with no established lifestyle, occupational or environmental risk factors.  
The clinical course of MM can be highly variable due to the heterogeneity of the disease with some 
patients progressing rapidly despite treatment and others remaining stable without therapy for a 
number of years. Common symptoms of MM include, but are not limited to, fatigue, persistent bone 
pain, pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression (from pathologic fracture), weakness, malaise,

anaemia and/or bleeding, frequent infections (often pneumococcal), hypercalcemia, renal failure, and 
neuropathies (Shah and Besa, 2018).  
The proposed therapeutic indication “TALVEY is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult 
patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, who have received at least 3 prior therapies, 
including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor, and an anti-CD38 antibody and have 
demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy” falls within the scope of the designated orphan 
condition “treatment of multiple myeloma”. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP, see 
EPAR. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
Multiple myeloma is estimated to represent 1.32% of all cancers in the EU-27, with an estimated 
incidence of 35800 cases in 2020 (Dyba 2021).   In 2020, there has been approximately 35,842 new 
cases of MM, and 23,275 deaths due to this disease in European Union (EU), according to the 
European Cancer Information System (ECIS 2021). Survival after diagnosis differs by age, with a 
recent global review reporting median relative survival among patients diagnosed at less than 65 years 
ranging from 50% to over 60 % among patients diagnosed at 65 years and older (Turesson 2018). 
Clinical complications of progressive MM include recurrent infections due to decreased production of 
antibodies, cytopenias (especially anaemia, but also thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia), renal failure 
due to the protein overload, hyperviscosity syndrome, hypercalcemia, bone pain, and pathologic 
fractures (Munshi et al., 2012). 
The sponsor has not identified any changes on the chronically debilitating or life-threatening nature of 
multiple myeloma since the original orphan designation was granted in August 2021. Multiple myeloma 
remains a life-threatening and chronic, debilitating condition. Despite multiple therapeutic options, 
multiple myeloma often recurs and remains incurable. All patients with this disease eventually relapse 
and become refractory to existing treatments. With each successive relapse, symptoms return, quality 
of life worsens, and both the chance of responding and duration of response typically decrease.  
The COMP has previously acknowledged that MM is chronically debilitating due to the development of 
hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anaemia and/or bleeding, frequent infections, and bone lesions, and 
life-threatening due to the poor survival of patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) disease. The 
condition therefore remains chronically debilitating and life-threatening in nature. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
At time of initial orphan designation in 2021, the COMP concluded that the condition was estimated to 
be affecting approximately 4.3 in 10,000 persons in the European Union.  
In the maintenance application, the sponsor referred to GLOBOCAN 5-year prevalence of 3.08 per 
10,000. Furthermore, EU country registries (CancerMPact and NORDCAN) provide slightly higher 10-
year and total prevalence estimates, with an average 10-year prevalence in 4 of the most populous EU 
countries of 3.52 per 10,000 and an average total prevalence in the 3 Nordic EU countries of 3.68 per 
10,000.  
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000126657 
Page 5/26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The sponsor also provided an indirect estimation of the prevalence based on incidence and survival.  
The incidence of multiple myeloma is consistently reported to be 0.8 per 10,000 people across the EU 
(ECIS 2020). However, median overall survival varies. To approximate the most comprehensive and up 
to date estimates of median overall survival, data from recent publications were used (Cho 2017, 
Greipp 2005, Kastritis 2017, Usmani 2018). Based on these data, the median OS for ISS Stage I/II 
patients, who represent 60% to 70% of all multiple myeloma patients, is approximately 7 years. For 
ISS Stage III patients, who represent 30% to 40% of all multiple myeloma patients, the median 
overall survival is approximately 1 to 4 years. 
Using these estimates, the median overall survival for the entire multiple myeloma population is 
therefore estimated to be 5.8 years ([7 years*0.6) + (4 years*0.4)]. Using the formula P=I*D, the 
updated prevalence is estimated to be (0.8*5.8) = 4.64 per 10,000 persons in the EU. The sponsor 
considers that although this is higher than previously reported estimates, it likely reflects the recent 
increases in survival among this population due to therapeutic advances, and it is a conservative 
approach that utilizes recently published comprehensive data sources. 
In relation to the indirect estimation for incidence multiplied with an approximated survival, the COMP 
considers whether the references above reflect the duration of survival according to recent advances in 
the therapeutic domain. Since improvements have been seen in the duration of survival probably also 
increasing the prevalence, the COMP considers that only sources beyond 2018 should be relevant for 
the estimation of survival and a more conservative approach should be followed. 
The sponsor is invited to update the prevalence estimates by referring to updated literature challenging 
the duration of condition (up to 20 years in their own trial) and updating references on multiple 
myeloma epidemiology (e.g. Blimark 2022, Dyba 2021, Moore 2022). 
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
The sponsor presented below the medicinal products authorized in EU for the treatment of 
relapsed/refractory MM:

and lenalidomide and were lenalidomide-refractory, or who have received at least 2 prior therapies 
that included lenalidomide and a PI and have demonstrated disease progression on or after the last 
therapy; or as a monotherapy for the treatment of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, for 
patients whose prior therapy included a PI and an IMiD (Darzalex EPAR 2022). 
• 
Isatuximab: in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone, for the treatment of adult 
patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least 2 prior 
therapies including lenalidomide and a PI and have demonstrated disease progression on the last 
therapy, and in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone, for the treatment of adult 
patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least 1 prior therapy (Sarclisa EPAR 2022). 
•  Panobinostat: in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone, for adult patients who have 
received at least 2 prior regimens including bortezomib and an IMiD (Farydak EPAR 2022). 
•  Elotuzumab: in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone after at least 1 prior therapy, 
and in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone after at least 2 prior therapies 
including lenalidomide and a PI (Empliciti EPAR 2022). 
•  Belantamab mafodotin: monotherapy for the treatment of multiple myeloma in adult patients who 
have received at least 4 prior therapies and whose disease is refractory to at least 1 PI, 1 IMiD, 
and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, and who have demonstrated disease progression on the 
last therapy (Blenrep EPAR 2022). 
•  Selinexor: in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone for the treatment of adult patients

dexamethasone for the treatment of multiple myeloma in adult patients who have received at least 
4 prior therapies and whose disease is refractory to at least 2 PIs, 2 IMiDs and an anti-CD38 
monoclonal antibody, and who have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy 
(Nexpovio EPAR 2022). 
•  Melphalan flufenamide: in combination with dexamethasone, for the treatment of adult patients

refractory to at least 1 PI, 1 IMiD, and 1 anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, and who have 
demonstrated disease progression on or after the last therapy. For patients with a prior autologous 
stem cell transplantation, the time to progression should be at least 3 years from transplantation 
(Pepaxti EPAR 2022).

2022). 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report

• 
Ide-cel: for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who 
have received at least 3 prior therapies, including an IMiD, a PI and an anti-CD38 antibody and 
have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy (Abecma EPAR 2022). 
•  Cilta-cel: for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who 
have received at least 3 prior therapies, including an IMiD, a PI and an anti-CD38 antibody and 
have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy (Carvykti EPAR 2022). 
The recently updated European Hematology Association (EHA) and European Society for Medical 
Oncology (ESMO) clinical practice guidelines for diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of MM describe 
recommended treatment options available for r/r MM patients in the third- and later lines setting 
(Dimopoulos, Ann Oncol. 2021; 32(3): 309-322). The EHA-ESMO guidelines distinguishes between 
treatment of elderly patients in the non-transplant setting, and younger or more fit patients in good 
clinical condition who are eligible for autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) in the transplant 
setting. Treatments are discussed as regards to front-line treatment, consolidation, maintenance, and 
r/r disease. According to the guidelines, the selection of a suitable regimen in third- or subsequent 
lines of therapy for any given patient depends on several parameters such as prior exposure, 
refractoriness, and sensitivity to specific agents or classes of agents in prior lines of therapy.  
The treatment algorithm for MM is evolving rapidly and the therapeutic field for the management of the 
condition is continuously changing. Currently, the following agents are specifically authorised in the r/r 
MM setting in the EU according to line of treatment:  
•  Second- and later lines: bortezomib, carfilzomib, ixazomib, lenalidomide, pomalidomide, 
daratumumab, isatuximab, and elotuzumab.  
• 
• 
• 
Third- and later lines: pomalidomide, daratumumab, isatuximab, elotuzumab, and 
panobinostat.  
Fourth- and later lines: ide-cel, cilta-cel, melphalan flufenamide and teclistamab  
Fifth- and later lines: belantamab and selinexor. 
Satisfactory methods for the target patient population  
Talquetamab is indicated for patients who have received at least 3 prior therapies, including an 
immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor, and an anti-CD38 antibody and have demonstrated 
disease progression or did not respond to the last therapy. In this specific therapeutic area, ide-cel, 
cilta-cel and teclistamab are considered satisfactory methods as these medicines are approved for 
triple-class exposed r/r MM patients in fourth- or later lines.  
Melphalan flufenamide is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with MM who have received at 
least 3 prior lines of therapies, whose disease is refractory to at least 1 PI, 1 IMiD, and 1 anti-CD38 
monoclonal antibody, and who have demonstrated disease progression on or after the last therapy. 
Since the proposed indication for talquetamab is for triple exposed patients who are refractory to the 
last therapy and not refractory towards one of each class (PI, IMiD, and anti-CD38 mAb), considered 
that talquetamab includes a broader patient population, which is not covered by melphalan 
flufenamide. 
The medicinal products belantamab and selinexor have more restricted therapeutic indications as 
compared to that for talquetamab. These agents are approved as fifth- and later lines of therapy in 
more refractory MM patients being either triple-class refractory (to a PI, an IMiD, and an anti-CD38 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000126657 
Page 8/26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
mAb) for belantamab or penta-class refractory (to 2 PIs, 2 IMiDs, and 1 anti-CD38 mAb) for selinexor, 
while talquetamab is approved for use in a less refractory patient population and already from fourth 
line of therapy. It is therefore considered that talquetamab does in principle include a broader patient 
population, which is not covered by belantamab and selinexor.  
With regards to elotuzumab, an anti-SLAM7 mAb, it is authorized in combination with a class of 
products to which a significant part of the target patient population for talquetamab was largely 
refractory to, i.e. IMiDs (lenalidomide, pomalidomide), (Empliciti EPAR 2021). Furthermore, 
elotuzumab is neither recommended for triple-class refractory patients with r/r MM or for patients 
refractory to lenalidomide or proteasome-inhibitors according to the EHA-ESMO guideline (Dimopoulos 
et al., 2021).  
Significant benefit 
Significant benefit of talquetamab has to be evaluated over the satisfactory methods ide-cel, cilta-cel 
and teclistamab for the target patient population. The sponsor also proposed belantamab mafodotin 
and selinexor as satisfactory methods, however as discussed in the section above, these are not 
considered satisfactory methods from a regulatory perspective.  
The justification for the significant benefit was based on an analysis of efficacy of talquetamab from 
Study 64407564MMY1001 based on prior therapies, including a subgroup analysis of the benefit of 
talquetamab in participants who had received prior T cell redirection therapy and also on an adjusted 
comparison of outcomes versus an external control arm using available individual participant-level data 
from Study 64407564MMY1001 and from the prospective observational studies LocoMMotion and 
MoMMent.  Finally, the sponsor discussed the differentiation of talquetamab from teclistamab and from 
CAR-T therapies. 
The sponsor received EMA protocol assistance dated 19 May 2022 with regards to the evidence needed 
to justify significant benefit of talquetamab over existing treatments used for the treatment of patients 
with r/r MM. The sponsor has used a similar approach as proposed during protocol assistance but did 
not comply with all the EMA recommendations. As set out during protocol assistance, the sponsor has 
conducted 2 types of efficacy analyses to establish the significant benefit of talquetamab compared 
with the existing therapies listed above. Additionally, the sponsor has more broadly compared 
talquetamab with teclistamab and available CAR-T therapies to demonstrate the significant benefit that 
talquetamab provides versus these agents.  
The efficacy and safety of talquetamab monotherapy was evaluated in patients with r/r MM in a single-
arm, open-label, multicentre study, MMY1001 (MonumenTAL-1).  The study included patients who had 
previously received at least three prior therapies, including a proteasome inhibitor, an 
immunomodulatory agent, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody. The study included patients who 
received prior T cell redirection therapy (N=51).  Patients received talquetamab 0.4 mg/kg 
subcutaneously weekly, following two step-up doses (0.01 and 0.06 mg/kg) in the first week of 
therapy, or talquetamab 0.8 mg/kg subcutaneously biweekly (Q2W every 2 weeks), following three 
step-up doses (0.01, 0.06 and 0.3 mg/kg), until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The 
below results reported for Study 64407564MMY1001 are based on data from the clinical cut-off of 
12 September 2022. 
Of 143 patients treated with talquetamab 0.4 mg/kg weekly who were not exposed to prior Tcell 
redirection therapy, the median age was 67 (range: 46 to 86) years, 55% were male, 90% were 
White, and 8% were Black or African American. Patients had received a median of 5 (range: 2 to 13)

prior therapies, and 78% of patients had received prior autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT).  
Ninety-four percent (94%) of patients were refractory to their last therapy, and 74% were refractory 
to a PI, immunomodulatory agent, and anti-CD38 antibody.  Of the 132 patients for whom baseline 
cytogenetic data were available, high-risk cytogenetic factors (presence of t (4:14), t (14:16), and/or 
del(17p)) were present in 31% of patients.  
Of 145 patients treated with talquetamab 0.8 mg/kg biweekly (every 2 weeks) who were not exposed 
to prior Tcell redirection therapy, the median age was 67 (range: 38 to 84) years, 57% were male, 
86% were White, and 6% were Black or African American.  Patients had received a median of 5 
(range: 2 to 17) prior therapies, and 79% of patients had received prior autologous stem cell 
transplantation (ASCT).  Ninety-four percent (94%) of patients were refractory to their last therapy, 
and 69% were refractory to a proteasome inhibitor, immunomodulatory agent, and anti-CD38 
antibody.  Of the 128 patients for whom baseline cytogenetic data were available, high-risk cytogenetic 
factors (presence of t (4:14), t (14:16), and/or del(17p)) were present in 29% of patients. 
•  Benefit of talquetamab in study 64407564MMY1001 participants without prior T Cell redirection 
therapy 
Data presented here are based on the participants treated in Study 64407564MMY1001 at either the 
0.4 mg/kg weekly SC RP2D (n=143) or the 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC RP2D (n=145) who had no prior T-cell 
redirection therapy (Table 1). These participants were heavily pretreated and a high proportion had 
refractory disease. Participants treated at 0.4 mg/kg weekly SC and participants treated at 0.8 mg/kg 
Q2W SC who had no prior T-cell redirection therapy had a median of 5 (range: 2 to 13) and 5 (range: 
2 to 17) prior therapies, respectively. In both groups, most participants (93.7% and 94.5%, 
respectively) were refractory to their last prior therapy. Among participants treated at 0.4 mg weekly 
SC, 74.1% were triple-class refractory (PI, IMiD, and anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody) and 29.4% were 
penta-refractory (at least 2 PIs, at least 2 IMiDs, and at least 1 anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody); 
among those treated at 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC, 69.0% were triple-class refractory and 23.4% were penta-
refractory.

•  Benefit of talquetamab in study 64407564MMY1001 participants with prior T Cell redirection therapy 
Data are presented for the participants in Study 64407564MMY1001 who were treated at either of the 
talquetamab RP2Ds and who had previously received prior T cell redirection therapy (n=51).  
The median age of these participants was 61.0 years (range: 38 to 78), and 7.8% were ≥75 years of 
age. More than half of the participants were male (60.8%), and most were White (92.2%). A majority

of participants had a baseline ECOG score of 1 (54.0%). Median time from initial diagnosis for these 
participants was 6.9 years (range: 1.7 to 19.6). The most common type of myeloma was light chain, in 
47.1% of participants, and 31.4% of participants had 1 or more extramedullary plasmacytomas at 
baseline. Of 44 participants with baseline cytogenetic data reported, 40.9% had at least 1 high-risk 
abnormality, most frequently del(17p). Of 50 participants with baseline ISS data reported, 47.1% were 
ISS Stage I, 35.3% were Stage II, and 17.6% were ISS Stage III. These participants had received a 
median of 6 (range: 3 to 15) prior therapies; 60.8% of participants were refractory to their last prior 
therapy, 84.3% were triple-class refractory and 41.2% were penta-refractory. 
Table 2 provides a summary of exposure and refractoriness to the prior therapies received by 
participants with prior T cell redirection therapy who received either of the talquetamab RP2Ds. This 
table also provides the ORRs from Study 64407564MMY1001 for those participants who were exposed 
to and whose disease was refractory to the prior therapies listed.

a N=51 ; bRefractory status was not uniformly collected on this study due to the variability in definition of refractoriness 
to a CART therapy. 
The sponsor acknowledges that only a small number of participants were exposed and refractory to 
BCMA-targeted T-cell redirection therapies prior to receiving either of the talquetamab RP2Ds. This is 
likely due to the recent approval and the limited availability of these therapies at the time of the 
participants’ enrolment in study 64407564MMY1001.  ORR in this cohort (n=51) was 62.7% (95% CI: 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report

48.1%, 75.9%) overall. ORRs were 44.4% among participants who received a prior bispecific antibody, 
and 72.2% among those who received prior CAR-T therapy (Table 2).  
Among the 7 participants treated with talquetamab who previously received treatment with 
teclistamab, all of whom had teclistamab-refractory disease, the ORR was 42.9%. Responses were also 
documented in participants who received prior ide-cel treatment (ORR: 73.3%), including in 1 of 3 ide-
cel-refractory participants (ORR: 33.3%), and in participants who received prior cilta-cel treatment 
(ORR: 66.7%).  Since all 6 participants who received prior treatment with cilta-cel had disease 
progression >60 days following CAR-T cell infusion, none were considered to be refractory to this CAR-
T therapy.  
Overall, among responders who received either of the talquetamab RP2Ds and had previously been 
exposed to T-cell redirection therapy, median follow-up was 11.8 months (range: 4.4 to 25.4) and 
84.4%, 59.4%, and 37.5% of responders had at least 6, 9, and 12 months of follow-up, respectively. 
The probability of responders remaining in response was 65.1% (95% CI: 45.8%, 78.9%) at 6 
months, 57.1% (95% CI: 37.3%, 72.6%) at 9 months, and 57.1% (95% CI: 37.3%, 72.6%) at 12 
months. As responses were maintained to the clinical cutoff for 18 of 32 responders (56.3%), DOR 
data were not yet mature (median DOR: 12.7 months [range: 3.7, not estimable]). 
The COMP considered the talquetamab efficacy data in patients who received prior T-cell redirection 
therapy with ide-cel and cilta-cel of relevance for the discussion of significant benefit. However, the 
sponsor should provide updated response rate and duration of responses as achieved with treatment 
with talquetamab for all patients in the pivotal study, overall and separately for the subgroup with 
patients who were pre-treated with ide-cel and cilta-cel individually, and after all BCMA-targeting 
agents. In addition, the sponsor should provide a comparison of the baseline characteristics of patients 
included in the pivotal studies KarMMa for ide-cel and MMY2001 for cilta-cel, versus study 
64407564MMY1001 for talquetamab. Finally, the sponsor should submit a matching-adjusted indirect 
comparisons, ideally by using individual patient data, of the efficacy outcomes between patients 
treated with ide-cel in KarMMa study and cilta-cel in MMY2001 study versus patients treated with 
talquetamab in Study 64407564MMY1001. 
Comparison of Study 64407564MMY1001 Efficacy Data Using Real-World Evidence 
In the absence of a direct comparator in Study 64407564MMY1001, an adjusted comparative analysis 
using the individual patient data from Study 64407564MMY1001 and from LocoMMotion and MoMMent, 
two prospective, observational studies of real-world physician’s choice of treatment and associated 
outcomes in triple-class exposed patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma has been 
provided by the sponsor. The objective of this analysis is to compare the efficacy results observed for 
talquetamab in Study 64407564MMY1001 to outcomes observed in similar patients treated with real-
world treatment options, and to provide a contemporaneous standard of care context for Study 
64407564MMY1001 data.  
LocoMMotion: This study, initiated in 2019, is an ongoing, prospective, non-interventional study 
detailing the use of RWPC of treatment for r/r patients with MM who have received at least 3 prior 
therapies or were double refractory to a PI and an IMiD; received a PI, IMiD, and anti-CD38 
monoclonal antibody, and have documented disease progression during or after their last treatment. 
The data are being collected prospectively across 76 sites in 10 countries. The primary endpoint is ORR 
as defined by IMWG response criteria and assessed by the Response Review Committee, which is 
composed of 3 leading hematologists in the field of multiple myeloma. The study has enrolled 248 
participants between August 2019 and October 2020. Study enrollment has been completed, with the 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report

last patient enrolled in October 2020. At the time of the clinical cutoff of 12 September 2022 for Study 
64407564MMY1001, the study was ongoing. Follow up continued until study completion (defined as 2 
years after last enrolled patient received first dose of treatment, ie, October 2022).  
Earlier results reported from LocoMMotion (Mateos 2022) showed an ORR of 29.8% (95% CI: 24.2, 
36.0), median PFS of 4.6 months (95% CI: 3.9, 5.6) and median OS of 12.4 months (95% CI: 10.3, 
not estimable). Moreover, 64.5% of LocoMMotion patients received a combination of 3 or more 
therapies. To further elaborate on the results from LocoMMotion, an additional study (MoMMent) was 
initiated. 
MoMMent: MoMMent is a prospective, observational study of RWPC of treatment in patients with r/r 
MM. Enrollment into this study started in November 2021. The MoMMent study has 2 consecutive 
enrolment periods. Period 1 has a target enrollment of 50 participants who have received at least 3 
prior therapies, including a PI, an IMiD, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, and has similar 
eligibility criteria to LocoMMotion. Period 1 enrolment has been designed with the primary goal of 
continuing the data collection initiated in LocoMMotion. Period 2 starts after completion of enrollment in 
Period 1 and will enroll participants who have received at least 3 prior therapies, including a PI, an 
IMiD, an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, and BCMA-targeted therapy. Although prior BCMA exposure 
is not an exclusion criterion in Period 1, the purpose of Period 2 is to enroll additional patients with 
prior BCMA-exposure to have total of 50 BCMA-exposed patients in the study. Study enrollment for 
Period 1 completed in July 2022 with at least 50 patients enrolled. Available data from Period 1 have 
been pooled with data from the LocoMMotion study and reported in aggregate to support the 
interpretation of results from Study 64407564MMY1001.  
Pooled data from these two prospective observational studies was compared against Study 
64407564MMY1001 data. The primary comparative analyses included all participants who received 
talquetamab at the 0.4 mg/kg weekly SC RP2D in Study 64407564MMY1001 (n=143) and all RWPC 
patients who met the inclusion criteria for Study 64407564MMY1001 (n=165). Additional comparative 
analyses included all participants who received talquetamab at the 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC RP2D in Study 
64407564MMY1001 (n=145) and all RWPC patients who met the inclusion criteria for Study 
64407564MMY1001 (n=165) (criteria not further described, handling of missing data not described). 
The analyses were performed based on a prespecified statistical analysis plan. Results reported for 
Study 64407564MMY1001 are based on data from the clinical cutoff of 12 September 2022.  
Very limited information is provided on the performance the prospective non-interventional trials 
(baseline characteristics, extent and handling of missing data), as well on the adjusted comparison of 
the pivotal study with the non-interventional studies (matching parameters, outcome of matching). 
Treatment received in the prospective non-interventional studies was however detailed in the CHMP 
report. The high rate of patients receiving doublet therapy or monotherapy in the non-interventional 
studies indicate that there were relevant differences in the populations form either the interventional 
and non-interventional studies. In addition, the non-interventional data provided do not inform on the 
outcomes of (BCMA-targeting/T-cell-redirecting agents) or how other authorised treatments perform 
after failure of these types of treatments.  
The COMP considered that since the comparison to the observational non-interventional studies did not 
inform on outcomes after the three approved satisfactory methods ide-cel, cilta-cel and teclistamab or 
on the outcomes observed after failure of these agents, it is not considered relevant for the 
justification of the significant benefit.

Comparative Analysis Results for 0.4mg/kg weekly SC and 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC 
Participants receiving talquetamab at either RP2D (0.4 mg/kg weekly SC or 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC) had 
superior outcomes compared with patients receiving other available treatments as measured by ORR, 
PFS, and OS. A propensity score weighted analysis using ATT weights was conducted to adjust for 
differences in baseline prognostic factors across Study 64407564MMY1001 and RWPC cohorts. After 
ATT adjustment, both cohorts were well balanced across all baseline prognostic factors, with all 
standardized mean differences <0.20. Results from the ATT analysis are summarized in Table 3.

teclistamab individually, and after all BCMA-targeting agents. The sponsor should also provide an 
indirect comparison including the baseline characteristics of the patient populations included in the 
pivotal study MajesTEC-1 for teclistamab versus study 64407564MMY1001 for talquetamab. In 
addition, the sponsor should submit a matching-adjusted indirect comparisons using individual patient 
level data of the efficacy outcomes between patients treated with teclistamab in MajesTEC-1 study 
versus patients treated with talquetamab in Study 64407564MMY1001.  
Differentiation from CAR-T therapies 
The sponsor claimed that CAR-T therapies have limitations with regards to eligibility, safety, logistical, 
and accessibility considerations that may prevent them from being practical and clinically appropriate 
for all patients with heavily pretreated multiple myeloma. Talquetamab would confer a clinically 
relevant advantage in this respect and would provide a major contribution to the care of relapsed and 
refractory multiple myeloma. As an off-the-shelf product without a lengthy, complex manufacturing 
process, talquetamab would be readily available for administration, thereby offering a prompt 
therapeutic option for all triple-class exposed patients, including those who require urgent disease 
control and/or are not medically fit to receive CAR-T therapy. 
The COMP acknowledged the sponsor’s arguments and considered that they are relevant from a clinical 
perspective. However, from a regulatory perspective within the remits of this procedure it is reminded 
that a (minimal) prerequisite for the claim of major contribution to patient care is the demonstration of 
the product’s equivalence in terms of efficacy, safety and benefit/risk balance as compared with 
relevant authorized medicinal products for the target patient population, i.e., in this case ide-cel and 
cilta-cel. Reference is made to the “Commission notice on the application of Articles 3, 5 and 7 of 
Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal products”:   
https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=OJ:JOC_2016_424_R_0003&from=EN  
Based on the data provided by the sponsor, the COMP considers that a positive conclusion on the 
product’s (talquetamab) equivalence in terms of efficacy, safety and benefit/risk balance vis a vis the 
satisfactory methods ide-cel and cilta-cel cannot be drawn.  
Overall conclusion COMP: 
The COMP adopted a list of questions on the prevalence and on the significant benefit.  
The COMP considered that the prevalence estimates should be updated by referring to updated 
literature challenging the duration of condition (up to 20 years in their own trial) and updating 
references on multiple myeloma epidemiology (eg. Blimark 2022, Dyba 2021, Moore 2022). 
In addition, the claim of significant benefit of talquetamab over the authorised satisfactory methods, 
ide-cel (Abecma), cilta-cel (Carvykti) and teclistamab (Tecvayli), and for the indication (subject to 
change pending the final CHMP outcome) was not considered to be established by the COMP, based on 
the data presented by the sponsor. A list of questions on significant benefit aiming at clarifying the 
duration of responses as achieved with treatment with talquetamab for all patients in the pivotal study, 
overall and separately for the subgroup with patients who were pre-treated with ide-cel, cilta-cel and 
teclistamab individually, and after all BCMA-targeting agents. In addition, a comparison of the baseline 
characteristics of patients included in the pivotal studies was requested. Finally, matching-adjusted 
indirect comparisons of the efficacy outcomes between patients treated with ide-cel in KarMMa study, 
cilta-cel in MMY2001 study and teclistamab in MajesTEC-1 study versus patients treated with 
talquetamab in Study 64407564MMY1001 were also requested.

Comments on sponsor’s response to the COMP list of issues 
In the written response, and during an oral explanation before the Committee on 12 July 2023, the 
sponsor presented their responses to the COMP’s list of questions. The sponsor reviewed the 
prevalence and selected a number of registries as well as referred to the primary care data base 
sources mentioned in the recently published DARWIN study.  A final pooled, random effects estimate of 
4.57 per 10,000 persons in 2020 was concluded upon.   
The sponsor calculated the pooled complete prevalence of MM in the EU by conducting a meta-analysis 
of prevalence proportions across cohorts from primary care and cancer registries reporting complete 
prevalence in 2020 using the metaprop function from the meta-R package (Barendregt 2013; Balduzzi 
2019). Meta-analysis forest plot pooling individual prevalence estimates from valid EU-27 data sources 
with complete prevalence in 2020 using common effects and random effects models is displayed in 
Figure 2.

Further to the COMP’s request, the sponsor provided the results of an updated meta-analyses by 
keeping a similar selection but providing weight of the studies in the overall estimate (Figure 3).

Overall response rate and duration of response, overall patient population in study 
64407564MMY1001: Updated results (17 January 2023) 
The sponsor submitted updated results from study 64407564MMY1001 (clinical cut-off of 17 January 
2023), providing an additional 4 months of follow-up data since the efficacy update (clinical cut-off of 
12 September 2022), that was included in the initial orphan maintenance report. A summary of the 
ORR and DOR is presented from the analysis of the RP2D populations of participants treated at 0.4 
mg/kg weekly SC (n=143; 21 in Phase 1 and 122 in Cohort A of Phase 2 or 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC 
(n=145; 36 in Phase 1 and 109 in Cohort C of Phase 2, in the ongoing, open-label, multicenter Phase 
1/2 Study 64407564MMY1001 and who initiated treatment on or before 20 April 2022 (included in the 
All Treated Analysis Set). 
For the 0.4 mg/kg Weekly SC participants with the additional >4 months of follow-up between the 
efficacy update and the updated clinical cut-off, the ORR (PR or better) remained stable as assessed by 
the IRC based on IMWG 2016 criteria of 74.1% (95% CI: 66.1%, 81.1%). This is consistent with the 
ORR reported in the primary CSR (72.7%) and efficacy update (74.1%). Most responses occurred 
rapidly and deepened over time, with a CR or better rate at the updated clinical cut-off of 33.6%. 
For the 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC participants with the additional >4 months of follow-up between the 
efficacy update and the updated clinical cut-off, 2 fewer responses were observed per IRC assessment, 
resulting in an ORR (PR or better) of 71.7% (95% CI: 63.7%, 78.9%) as assessed by the IRC based 
on IMWG 2016 criteria (Table 4). This ORR was greater than in the primary CSR (55.2%) and similar 
to the efficacy update (73.1%). Most responses occurred rapidly and deepened over time, with an 
improved CR or better rate at the updated clinical cutoff of 38.6%. 
With the additional >4 months of follow-up at the updated clinical cut-off, median DOR for participants 
assigned to talquetamab 0.4 mg/kg weekly SC was 9.5 months (95% CI: 6.7, 13.3) overall. The 
percentages of participants estimated to be in response at 6, 9, and 12 months were consistent with 
the primary CSR. The median DOR for participants assigned to talquetamab 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC was 
not mature, and 88.6% of responders had at least 9 months of follow-up.

The sponsor provided updated ORR and DOR results based on a more recent clinical cut-off of 17 
January 2023, including a longer follow up from the previous analysis included in the initial orphan 
maintenance report. The updated data from Study 64407564MMY1001 are provided from participants 
treated with either RP2D (0.4 mg/kg weekly SC or 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC) who were pre-treated with 
teclistamab, ide-cel, and cilta-cel individually. From the primary analysis, a total of 51 participants who 
initiated study drug on or before 20 April 2022 in either phase of the study and who were exposed to a 
T cell redirection therapy were included (Table 4). 
To further substantiate these updated results, the sponsor has performed another analysis including an 
additional 19 participants from Study 64407564MMY1001 who were pretreated with a BCMA CAR T 
(including ide-cel and cilta-cel); BCMA bispecific (including teclistamab), and other BCMA-targeting 
agents (including belantamab mafodotin) and who were enrolled on or before 2 November 2022 and 
initiated treatment with 0.4 mg/kg weekly SC or 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC talquetamab after 20 April 2022 
(clinical cut-off: 17 January 2023; n=70). These 19 participants were not included in the initial primary 
analysis due to insufficient follow-up (ie, participants were excluded in the analysis if they had <4 
weeks of follow up from the primary analysis cut-off of 16 May 2022) (Table 5).

As requested, the sponsor provided a comparison of the baseline characteristics of patients included in 
the pivotal studies KarMMa for ide-cel, MMY2001 for cilta-cel, and MajesTEC-1 study for teclistamab vs 
the participants of Study 64407564MMY1001 (Table 6). According to the sponsor the main baseline 
characteristics reported across the 4 studies showed no systematic differences between studies and no 
major imbalances.

Recently, the COMP accepted a prevalence estimate based on an indirect calculation of incidence times 
duration. A disease duration of 5.8 years was used (Greipp 2005; Cho 2017; Kastritis 2017; Usmani 
2018). Based on these assumptions, the median OS for International Staging System (ISS) stage I/II 
patients, who represent 60-70% of all MM patients, is approximately 7 years. For ISS stage III 
patients, who represent 30-40% of all MM patients, the median OS is approximately 1-4 years, i.e. 
using a 7-year mOS for ISS stage I/II, representing 60% of the population and 4-year mOS for ISS 
stage III, representing 40%.  
Combining this OS estimate in MM together with the ECIS 2020 incidence data of MM of 0.8, the 
estimated prevalence results in 4.6 per 10,000 persons, i.e. (0.8*5.8) = 4.64 per 10,000 persons. 
While this indirect way of estimating prevalence has also methodological limitations, it was accepted by 
the COMP for the recent orphan maintenance designations of Abecma and Carvykti and is also relevant 
and preferable for this procedure, based on the above discussion of the more recent data.   
Furthermore, the sponsor further justified the claim for significant benefit of talquetamab over ide-cel 
(Abecma), cilta-cel (Carvykti) and teclistamab (Tecvayli), for the target multiple myeloma population 
as requested. 
Updated data on response (ORR, VGPR, (s)CR, PR) are provided for all patients receiving the RP2D. 
Updated results are overall similar and subgroup analyses demonstrate consistent results in both 
cohorts. DOR data are also in line with previous results and indicate continued benefit in responding 
patients (data not mature especially for the biweekly schedule (73% censored patients), however).   
The ORR among participants who had prior CAR-T therapy was higher among participants treated with 
talquetamab in Study 64407564MMY1001 than among participants treated with teclistamab in 
MajesTEC-1 (73.5% versus 45.5%, respectively) and no participant in the MajesTEC-1 had received 
prior bi-specific antibodies. The ORR for participants who were previously exposed to any (not 
necessarily specified) BCMA-targeting agent was 64.0%.  
Talquetamab elicits high and durable (still ongoing in recent cut-off date) responses in patients with 
prior BCMA-targeted therapies, including bispecific antibodies and CAR-T therapy (i.e., teclistamab, 
ide-cel, and cilta-cel). Additionally, talquetamab would provide the first GPRC5D-targeted therapy to 
patients who have exhausted all other treatment options.  
The COMP also agreed with the sponsor that there are no major differences in terms of the baseline 
characteristics of patients included in the pivotal studies KarMMa for ide-cel, MMY2001 for cilta-cel, and 
MajesTEC-1 study for teclistamab vs the participants of Study 64407564MMY1001. 
Finally, the sponsor performed MAICs but not using IPD data as asked for. Very little information is 
given on the methodology of the MAICs and the quality of the comparisons cannot be judged (e.g. no 
ESS given). Results for the efficacy endpoints ORR, DOR, PFS, and OS are provided in both tables and 
figures. Talquetamab appears sometimes better and sometimes worse in this indirect comparison, but 
the results cannot be adequately assessed in view of the lack of reported details.   Since the durable 
responses elicited among patients across several BCMA targeting agents (CAR-T, bispecific and AbDC) 
are considered sufficient for the justification of significant benefit, the MAICs are no longer needed.    
COMP conclusion: 
In conclusion, the COMP agreed on a prevalence of 4.6 in 10.000 persons. In addition the significant 
benefit of talquetamab over the authorized Tecvayli, Abecma and Carvykti is considered to be 
established based on improved and durable responses with Talvey in patients with relapsed and

refractory multiple myeloma, who have been pretreated with the authorised medicinal products 
(Tecvayli, Abecma and Carvykti) and who have received at least 3 prior therapies, including an 
immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor, and an anti-CD38 antibody and have demonstrated 
disease progression on the last therapy. 
4.  COMP position adopted on 21 July 2023 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product. 
the prevalence of multiple myeloma (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to 
remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be approximately 4.6 in 10,000 persons in the 
European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is chronically debilitating and life-threatening due to development of hypercalcemia, 
renal insufficiency, anaemia, bone lesions, and reduced life expectancy; 
although satisfactory methods for the treatment of the condition have been authorised in the 
European Union for all the patients covered by Talvey, the assumption that Talvey may be of 
potential significant benefit to those affected by the orphan condition still holds. The sponsor has 
provided clinical study data that demonstrated improved and durable responses with Talvey in 
patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, who have been pretreated with the 
authorised medicinal products (Tecvayli, Abecma and Carvykti) and who have received at least 3 
prior therapies, including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor, and an anti-CD38 
antibody and have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy.  
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Talvey, talquetamab for 
treatment of multiple myeloma (EU/3/21/2486) is not removed from the Community Register of 
Orphan Medicinal Products.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Haemophilia A is a recessive X-linked congenital bleeding disorder, caused by mutation in the 
coagulation factor eight (FVIII) gene on the long arm of the X-chromosome. The incidence of 
haemophilia A is approximately 1 in 5,000 males. Patients with haemophilia A lack or have a reduced 
production of FVIII, or they produce biochemically defective FVIII molecules. 
Assessment report  
EMA/612026/2013 
Page 7/108 
 
  
  
 
 
Haemophilia A is classified as ‘severe (<1%)’, ‘moderate (1−5%)’ or ‘mild (>5%)’ according to the 
plasma activity of FVIII. With a deficiency or absence of FVIII, the activation of coagulation factor ten 
(FX) becomes severely impaired, and consequently, the thrombin burst becomes delayed and 
insufficient for normal haemostasis. Replacing the endogenous FVIII acts as an important co-factor in 
the activation of FX in the human coagulation cascade leads to thrombin generation and the formation 
of a stable haemostatic plug. The slow clot formation in patients with haemophilia A results in a fragile 
haemostatic plug that is easily dissolved by normal fibrinolytic activity, leading to impaired 
haemostasis, prolonged bleeds and re-bleeds. Recurrent bleeds in the same location, most commonly 
a weight-bearing joint, lead to chronic arthropathy, muscular atrophy and deformities. Treatment of 
bleeds as they manifest may delay this process, but does not prevent it. 
As the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) epidemics have subsided, the 
most serious complication to haemophilia treatment is development of neutralising antibodies against 
FVIII (inhibitors). Inhibitors develop in as many as 24% of patients with severe haemophilia A. 
Primary prophylaxis with regular FVIII injections initiated at an early age of life is regarded as the 
optimal care for children with severe haemophilia A and according to the World Federation of 
Hemophilia, prophylaxis must be the goal of all haemophilia care programmes until a cure is available.  
Novo Nordisk has developed a human recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) (international nonproprietary 
name: turoctocog alfa), within the pharmacological class ‘anti-haemophilia factors’. The molecule is 
produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and consists of a heavy chain of 87 kiloDalton (kDa), 
including a 21 amino acid residue truncated B-domain, and a light chain of 79 kDa. The two chains are 
held together by non-covalent interactions. The CHO cell culture medium is without serum- or 
animal-derived components. The trial product, turoctocog alfa, was developed in order to increase 
treatment options for patients with haemophilia A. 
The clinical development program for turoctocog was conducted between March 2009 and November 
2011 to obtain MA in the European Union and other markets including the US and was based on current 
relevant clinical guidelines. During the development, the guideline on the clinical investigation of 
recombinant factor VIII and IX products was under revision. In 2007, CPMP/BPWG/1561/99 rev.1 was 
published for consultation. In this draft, severe haemophilia A was defined as factor VIII ≤1%. In the 
meantime, it was decided to provide separate guidance documents for FVIII and FIX products. 
Therefore, in July 2009, the guideline on the clinical investigation of recombinant and human 
plasma-derived factor VIII products (EMEA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009) was published for consultation, 
and in 2011 the finished guidance was published, coming into effect in February 2012. In this guideline, 
severe haemophilia A was defined as factor VIII <1% in accordance with the definition by the World 
Federation of Hemophilia. 
Current options for recombinant FVIII replacement therapy in haemophilia A include Advate and 
Recombinate (Baxter), Kogenate FS/Kogenate Bayer (Bayer) and Xyntha/ReFacto AF  (Pfizer). All 
products have a similar efficacy profile.  
Novo Nordisk A/S applied for the following indication: Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients 
with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency). 
The product was presented as a powder and solvent for solution for injection 250 IU, 500 IU, 1000 IU, 
1500 IU, 2000 IU, 3000 IU.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The turoctocog alfa drug substance is a recombinant glycoprotein that is secreted by a genetically 
modified Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line.  
The turoctocog alfa molecule is a polypeptide containing a heavy chain of 87 kDa and a light chain of 79 
kDa held together by non-covalent interactions.  
Turoctocog alfa is expressed as a single chain where heavy and light chains are connected by a 
truncated B-domain of 21 amino acids. Once activated by thrombin cleavage, the resulting rFVIIIa has 
the same structure as endogenous FVIIIa. The posttranslational modifications of turoctocog alfa include 
eight disulfide bridges, six tyrosine sulfations and seven glycosylation sites.  
The drug product is a powder for solution for injection. Turoctocog alfa contains no preservatives and, 
after reconstitution with 0.9% sodium chloride solution, is intended to be administered by intravenous 
injection. 
Turoctocog alfa drug product is provided as a sterile non-pyrogenic cake in 5 mL glass vials closed with 
rubber stoppers. The present application includes six nominal drug product strengths: 250 IU, 500 IU, 
1000 IU, 1500 IU, 2000 IU and 3000 IU. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
New active substance status 
Turoctocog alfa is produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells. The molecule consists of a heavy chain of 
87 kDa including a 21 amino acid residue truncated B-domain and a light chain of 79 kDa. The two 
chains are held together by non-covalent interactions. Two variants of the heavy chain are present in 
the purified product, namely with and without the B-domain linker attached. This linker is removed 
upon thrombin activation of turoctocog alfa rendering the activated turoctocog alfa (FVIIIa) molecule 
similar to FVIIIa derived from FVIII with a complete B-domain (Figure 1). 
The amino acid sequence of NovoEight is different to other FVIII products currently authorised. 
Although intensively studied, the B-domain does not seem to be required for FVIII function and stability 
as FVIII molecules with large B-domain truncations (e.g. turoctocog alfa) or no B-domain have full 
biological activity. For FVIII to be an effective cofactor for FIXa, activation to FVIIIa by thrombin is 
necessary; a reaction that results in the formation of a heterotrimer composed of the A1, A2 domains 
(HC) and A3, C1 and C2 domains (LC) and as seen in Figure 1. Regardless of the B-domain, the 
structure of the activated form (FVIIIa) is the same. 
Assessment report  
EMA/612026/2013 
Page 9/108 
 
  
  
 
 
Based on the review of data on the quality properties of the active substance, indicating that turoctocog 
alfa is neither a full-length nor a B-domain deleted FVIII, but a new B-domain truncated variant of the 
human coagulation FVIII, where 21 amino acids of the B-domain are left (before thrombin activation). 
Therefore, the CHMP considers that turoctocog alfa can be qualified as a new active substance. 
Manufacture 
Description of Manufacturing process and process controls 
The routine manufacturing process is divided into three main steps including cell culture, capture and 
purification.  
Turoctocog  alfa  is  expressed  in  the  Chinese  Hamster  Ovary  (CHO)  cell  line,  and  exclusively 
non-animal-derived raw materials are used.  
An overview for the manufacture of turoctocog alfa drug substance is provided in the flow-chart below.

Description of the cell culture and harvest process  
The cell culture process comprises four steps including the propagation in the seed laboratory, 
propagation in  bioreactors, and the main cell culture step in the production bioreactor.  
In order to remove cells and cell debris, each harvest is clarified by a sequence of centrifugation and 
filtration before capture and purification is performed.  
Process parameters with limits/ranges and the in-process controls are in place and described. Before 
the harvest, the viability is controlled and at the end of each cell culture, the in-process specification 
tests for sterility, mycoplasma and virus are performed.

Description of the capture and purification process  
The capture process consists of a mixed-mode chromatography step. The purification process consists 
of immunoaffinity chromatography, anion exchange chromatography, virus reduction by nanofiltration 
(20 nm filter) and size exclusion chromatography. 
Appropriate in-process controls comprised of process parameters and in-process tests are in place to 
control the different manufacturing steps. 
Filling and storage  
The drug substance obtained after the last chromatographic step is filled in containers and stored 
frozen, until transported to the formulation and filling department for the drug product. 
Control of materials 
Manufacture of turoctocog alfa 
Development genetics and cell banking system: 
The Applicant presented a sufficiently detailed description of the cloning procedure to generate the 
Research Cell Bank. The sources of the materials used are specified and selected literature regarding 
the human FVIII gene (for production of turoctocog alfa) is referenced. 
The transgene plasmids were sequenced and characterized by restriction enzyme analysis. The cloning 
strategy for the turoctocog alfa expression vector is adequate and is described in sufficient detail.  
The description and control of the expression construct is in accordance with the guideline ICH Q5B 
(Quality of Biotechnological Products: Analysis of the Expression Construct in Cell Lines Used for 
Production of r-DNA-Derived Protein Products).  
A two-tiered cell-banking system is used, consisting of a MCB and a WCB which are both stored at two 
different locations. The documentation provided supports compliance with the guideline ICH Q5D 
(Quality of Biotechnological Products: Derivation and Characterisation of Cell Substrates Used for 
Production of Biotechnological/Biological Products). 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
The control of the manufacturing process is based on the assessment of critical and non-critical process 
parameters during process development and evaluation. Appropriate in-process controls, composed of 
process parameters and in-process tests, were defined. A severity ranking for Critical Quality Attributes 
(CQA) for the manufacture of the drug substance was provided. The general approach to assure a 
consistent and reliable manufacturing process is in compliance with guideline ICH Q6B (Specifications: 
Test Procedures and Acceptance Criteria for Biotechnological/Biological Products).  
In-process controls are in place to control the fermentation process from the shake flask expansion to 
the bioreactor production The detection of contamination with virus, bacteria and mycoplasma when 
testing EPC results in discarding the batch. 
The in-process controls are specified by limits and ranges and are considered appropriate. The 
in-process control limits assure a reproducible production process in the  bioreactor over the cell 
production period. 
In–process controls were also set for the clarification of the harvest by filtration and centrifugation  as 
well as for the time from harvest to capture . In-process controls (process parameters and in-process 
Assessment report  
EMA/612026/2013

tests) were also defined for the capture and purification process. The hold times during the process 
steps were indicated and justified by validation data. 
The virus inactivation step by detergent treatment is performed as part of the capture and purification 
process. 
The virus reduction step  is performed by nanofiltration using two 20 nm filters in series. The 
performance of this step is controlled by the in-process tests for leakage before and after filtration.  
Process validation and/or evaluation 
The process validation strategy of the turoctocog alfa drug substance manufacturing process is 
comprised of three important key elements including process design (process evaluation studies and 
validation of impurity reduction), Process Performance Qualification (PPQ) and continued process 
verification (extended monitoring of process performance) by compliance, yield and selected 
impurities; Critical Quality Attributes (CQA) for the manufacturing process were adequately defined. 
The verification of the manufacturing process was done during Process Performance Qualification 
(PPQ). The Process Performance Qualification covers the three parts of the manufacturing process of 
the turoctocog alfa drug substance including cell culture, capture and purification. PPQ was performed 
with batches manufactured according to the commercial process and covering each step in order to 
demonstrate the consistency of the drug substance manufacturing process. 
Process validation data were provided for all process steps covering the manufacture of turoctocog alfa.  
Overviews of process validation parameters, acceptance criteria and validation test results were 
provided as validation report summaries covering the process evaluation for the cell culture and harvest 
steps as well as for the capture and purification steps. 
The process validation data provided is acceptable. Robust/consistent performance of the 
manufacturing process could be demonstrated. In general, the process validation for the manufacture 
of turoctocog alfa drug substance is considered acceptable.  
Manufacturing process development 
The process changes during development and their rationale are appropriately described. Between 
manufacturing campaigns, minor adjustments of the process as well as significant changes were 
introduced. The Applicant performed extensive comparability studies in compliance wihth the guideline 
ICH Q5E in order to investigate the impact of the process changes on product quality. In conclusion, 
comparability between nonclinical batches, clinical batches and PPQ batches was demonstrated. The 
process is therefore consistent and reproducible and yields drug substance of adequate quality. 
Characterisation 
Turoctocog  alfa  was  extensively  characterised  by  physicochemical  methods  in  accordance  with 
guideline ICH Q6B. The structural characterisation and the physicochemical properties confirmed the 
expected properties for a recombinant FVIII product. 
The Applicant provided justification that turoctocog alfa is converted to the same FVIIIa as endogenous 
FVIII. Data on the biological in vitro characterisation including the kinetics of interaction with VWF and 
the characterisation of co-factor activity as well as rates for activation and inactivation were provided as 
part of the dossier. 
Assessment report  
EMA/612026/2013 
Page 13/108 
 
  
  
 
 
The comparability of representative batches throughout development and commercial manufacture as 
well as with the primary reference materials for turoctocog alfa was demonstrated. 
In general, the impurity profile regarding product- and process-related impurities was appropriately 
investigated. Selected impurities are included in the drug substance specification in order to ensure the 
quality of the drug substance and the final drug product.  
Control of drug substance 
Specification 
The drug substance is appropriately controlled by the parameters tested including specifications for 
product- and process-related impurities. The release parameters and their specifications are adequate 
and meet the requirements as outlined in guideline ICH Q6B. 
The  specifications  for  drug  substance  mainly  comprise  the  following  parameters:  Appearance,  pH, 
identity,  potency,  specific  activity,  content,  purity,  product-related  substances,  product-related 
impurities, process-related impurities, peptide map,  microbial count, and bacterial endotoxins. 
The acceptance criteria for the control parameters are based on historical data including preclinical and 
clinical batches from process development as well as from performance qualification batches.  
In general, the specifications are in accordance  with Ph. Eur.  requirements. The acceptance criteria 
assure that turoctocog alfa drug substance meets consistent quality.  
Analytical procedures and validation of analytical procedures 
The description of the analytical procedures and the provided validations are in general acceptable. 
The development of the Host Cell protein assay (ELISA) was described in sufficient detail in order to 
evaluate the analysis data presented for HCP.  
Batch analyses 
Appropriate batch analyses data were provided. 
Reference standards or materials  
The potency standards PRM and SRM were calibrated against WHO 8th International Standard Factor 
VIII Concentrate (NIBSC code: 07/350) using the chromogenic assay (Ph. Eur. monograph 2.7.4). Both 
reference standards have undergone release testing and stability data were provided. The reference 
materials are sufficiently described and are acceptable. 
Container closure system 
The primary packaging materials for storage of the drug substance are in compliance with Ph. Eur.  and 
are suitable for the intended use.   
Stability 
Turoctocog alfa drug substance will be stored frozen, the proposed shelf life is 24 months. The primary 
and  supportive  stability  studies  were  performed  according  to  the  current  ICHQ5C  guideline.  The 
parameters chosen to investigate the stability of the drug substance are acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/612026/2013 
Page 14/108 
 
  
  
Based on the currently available stability data for  drug substance a maximum shelf life of 24 months 
appears justified.

The finished product is formulated with L-histidine, sucrose, polysorbate 80, sodium chloride, 
L-methionine, calcium chloride. 
All excipients are of non-animal derived origin and of pharmacopoeial quality. They are common in 
lyophilized parenteral products and their function appears justified. 
Turoctocog alfa drug product is filled into vials as a concentrated bulk solution and is to be reconstituted 
with 4.3 ml of solvent 0.9 % sodium chloride. A 0.3 ml overfill serves to assure a labelled 4 ml volume 
for administration. The product is for single-use and does not contain antimicrobial preservatives. The 
non-sterile bulk drug substance is sterile filtered, filled into vials and lyophilized in an aseptic process to 
assure sterility of the finished product. 
The solvent 0.9% sodium chloride solution is presented in a prefilled 5 ml syringe. The solvent is made 
of sodium chloride and WFI which are both of Ph. Eur. quality. All components of the pre-filled syringe 
coming into contact with the product are of Ph. Eur. quality.  
All six presentations of turoctocog alfa are filled into 5 ml vials of type I glass according Ph. Eur. Vials are 
closed with rubber stoppers which meet Ph. Eur. requirements. The composition of the product also 
contains a sterile, disposable vial adapter. Compatibility of the product with the primary packaging and 
the transfer device has been demonstrated. No administration set is provided with the product. 
The drug product formulation is mainly based on the knowledge of FVIII stabilization from literature 
and from Novo Nordisk’s experience with its own recombinant products.  
Pharmaceutical Development 
In general the pharmaceutical development of the drug product has been adequately described. The 
choice of excipients and the composition of the product appear justified and are comparable to other 
lyophilized recombinant coagulation factors for intravenous use. 
The drug product formulation is mainly based on the knowledge of FVIII stabilization from literature and 
from Novo Nordisk’s experience with its own recombinant products. During development the applied 
manufacturing process has been optimised. The minor differences between the manufacturing 
processes relate to the following changes: 
• 
• 
Optimization of the lyophilisation process 
Optimisation of the filling process 
Manufacture of the product 
The drug product manufacture is performed in equipment that is qualified for the intended purpose. All 
equipment coming into contact with the product is dedicated to turoctocog alfa drug product and is 
cleaned/ sanitized/depyrogenated in accordance with GMP requirements.  
The manufacturing process has been described in sufficient detail. Maximum processing times, 
including hold times are specified.  
Assessment report  
EMA/612026/2013

Process Validation 
Risk assessments have been performed to identify the steps in the manufacturing process with an 
impact on the critical quality attributes (CQA’s), to eliminate unacceptable risks and define mitigating 
actions if moderate risks are identified. The lyophilisation process has been validated in compliance with 
the Note for guidance on process validation (CPMP/QWP/848/96). Selecting acceptance limits based on 
phase 3 batch specification, and setting tighter specifications for release can be accepted, provided 
batch analysis data on conformance lots demonstrates that after full scale validation the product meets 
those release specifications consistently. Challenging conditions are chosen during the validation 
demonstrating that the process is sufficiently robust.  
Control of Drug Product  
The release testing of turoctocog alfa drug product is performed by validated assays. These are mostly 
compendial analytical methods for which no validation is presented, because Ph. Eur. test methods are 
considered as validated methods. In the DS section the analytical methods are adequately described. 
The B-domain truncated rFVIII turoctocog alfa and the International Standard for Factor VIII 
concentrate behave similarly in the potency assays. This is demonstrated by data from the applicant, as 
well as by data obtained during the pre-authorisation testing at the control laboratory PEI (Paul Ehrlich 
Institute, Germany), both justifying calibration of turoctocog alfa drug product against the International 
Standard for factor VIII. The applicant has adequately investigated potential new impurities that might 
appear upon drug product manufacture or storage. The applicant has defined critical quality attributes 
as part of the control strategy. A severity rate has been defined to categorize the impact of a CQA on 
product quality or stability. The entire control strategy and selected specifications appear in accordance 
with the ICH Q6B, and the production process is well under control. Consistency of product quality is 
demonstrated by batch release data. Some specifications might be tightened, when more 
manufacturing experience and commercial batch release data are available.  
Product specifications 
The applicant followed recommendations as outlined in ICH Q6B for setting specifications. 
Specifications for drug product are based on pharmaceutical development data and manufacturing 
experience, including stability data. The specifications appear justified and some may be revised with 
manufacturing experience. Drug product specifications comprises the following: 
Appearance, pH, identification, potency, purity, product-related impurities, content , particulate 
matter, osmolality, bacterial endotoxin, sterility. 
In general, the specifications are in accordance with Ph. Eur. requirements.  
Container closure system  
The container/closure system is in compliance with Ph. Eur. requirements. A transfer device is part of 
the secondary packaging to allow for the transfer of the solvent into the drug product vial and for the 
transfer of the reconstituted product into the syringe. Compatibility of the container/closure with the 
product is demonstrated by data, including integrity tests.  
Stability of the product 
Stability studies have been performed in accordance with ICHQ5C at real time and at accelerated 
conditions.  The applicant’s proposal of a shelf life of 24 month at 5°C is acceptable, including up to 6 
Assessment report  
EMA/612026/2013 
Page 17/108 
 
  
  
 
month at room temperature (≤30°C). Up to 6 month storage at room temperature (≤ 30°C) can be 
accepted, since the release and shelf life specifications have been set sufficiently tight, assuring a 
product of consistent quality and purity during the entire proposed shelf life.  
Therefore, the stability data presented so far are considered useful to define a suitable drug product 
shelf life.  
Drug Product (Solvent 0.9% sodium chloride solution) 
The information provided for the solvent 0.9% sodium solution in a pre-filled syringe is considered 
satisfactory to demonstrate that the solvent is produced in a well-controlled, validated manufacturing 
process. Process and batch consistency is demonstrated. 24 month real time/real temperature stability 
data without any excursions are available at the moment. The proposed shelf life of 36 month at 5°C to 
30 °C can be accepted.   
Adventitious agents safety evaluation 
TSE compliance 
The active drug substance of turoctocog alfa is produced in genetically engineered Chinese hamster 
ovary (CHO) cells using serum-free medium. No material of animal origin is added during fermentation 
of turoctocog alfa. The MCB and WBC which have been established for the expression of turoctocog alfa 
are free from TSE-risk substances. 
Virus safety 
Turoctocog alfa is expressed using genetically engineered CHO cells. The fermentation process for 
turoctocog alfa is in serum-free medium. No other material of animal origin is added during 
fermentation of turoctocog alfa. This minimises possible contamination by adventitious viruses. The 
cells used for production of turoctocog alfa have been sufficiently screened for viruses. These tests 
failed to demonstrate the presence of any viral contaminant in the master cell bank or cells at the limit 
of in vitro cell age used for the expression of turoctocog alfa. The exception was the detection of 
intracellular A-type and C-type retroviral particles which are well known to be present in rodent cells. 
However, this is acceptable since there is sufficient capacity within the manufacturing procedure of 
turoctocog alfa for reduction of this type of virus particle therefore, there are no concerns regarding the 
production process of turoctocog alfa. 
The purification process of turoctocog alfa includes several steps for inactivation/removal of enveloped 
viruses. The effectiveness of these steps has been sufficiently demonstrated.  
In summary, the virus and TSE safety of turoctocog alfa has been sufficiently demonstrated. 
Pre authorisation testing: 
As discussed under the control of drug product section, the testing of the drug product prior to 
authorisation was requested and concluded the following: 
The preauthorisation testing of turoctocog alfa DP lots has not indicated any deviation from established 
release specifications for potency, based on the chromogenic substrate assay. 
All drug product samples, the controls and the reference materials showed similar behaviour in the 
parallel line and in the slope ratio model of evaluation. Hence, labelling of turocotocog alfa drug product 
relative to the FVIII International Standard in IU/ml seems adequate.  
Assessment report  
EMA/612026/2013 
Page 18/108 
 
  
  
Both, the chromogenic substrate and the one stage clotting assay appear suitable for monitoring 
turoctocog alfa in clinical samples.  
GMP status: 
Valid GMP certificates were available for the facilities involved in the manufacture, storage and testing 
of the turoctocog drug substance and drug product or the generation and storage of the Master Cell 
Bank (MCB) and Working Cell Bank (WCB). 
The manufacturing sites for drug substance and drug product have been inspected and accepted. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Turoctocog alfa is a B-domain-truncated recombinant rFVIII produced in CHO cells. After activation, 
turoctocog alfa is structurally and biochemically similar to plasma-derived FVIII. The rFVIII has been 
sufficiently characterised with respect to physicochemical and biochemical properties. 
The production of the transgenic CHO cell line and the cell banking were performed in accordance with 
the relevant guidance documents. The upstream fermentation process and the downstream purification 
process were appropriately validated. 
The drug substance manufacturing process is well controlled, leading to turoctocog alfa drug substance 
of consistent quality with an acceptable level of residual product- and process-related impurities. In 
addition, the risk for viral contamination is minimised through the sufficiently controlled cell banking 
system and fermentation process. During drug substance purification two effective virus reduction 
steps were incorporated.  
The following issues regarding the turoctocog alfa drug substance were raised during the evaluation 
process and were sufficiently addressed by the applicant. 
The development of the Host Cell Protein (HCP) assay was described in more detail in order to evaluate 
the analysis data presented for HCP. 
In addition, the proposed shelf life of the drug substance of 24 months when stored frozen was 
supported by updated  stability data for batches of the commercial process. 
The B-domain truncated rFVIII turoctocog alfa and the International Standard for Factor VIII 
concentrate show similar behaviour in the potency assays, concluding that calibration against the 
International Standard for factor VIII is appropriate. 
Suitability of the drug product with the container/closure system is demonstrated by respective studies 
and stability of the final product.  
The proposed shelf life of 24 months at 2-8 °C with up to 6 months at ≤30°C is considered acceptable. 
The CHMP agreed with the applicant’s responses to the list of questions and all the questions raised 
during the procedure have now been adequately addressed. 
No quality aspects impacting on the benefit risk balance have been identified for NovoEight.

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Overall, the data presented indicate that turoctocog alfa drug product is manufactured in a validated, 
controlled process taking into consideration relevant guidance documents. Batch release data confirm 
a product of consistent quality. From a quality point of view turoctocog alfa is recommended for 
approval. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends points for further investigation. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The non-clinical safety evaluation programme of turoctocog alfa was designed in accordance with the 
guideline for biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals provided by the International Conference of 
Harmonisation (ICH), ICH S6(R1), 2011 and the parts of ICH M3(R2), 2009 relevant to 
biopharmaceuticals, to support clinical use in males with congenital FVIII deficiency. In vivo studies 
were performed in mouse, rat, dog and monkey. All pivotal safety studies were conducted in accordance 
with current regulatory requirements and in compliance with the principles of Good Laboratory Practice 
(GLP). Nevertheless, the single dose escalation toxicity, one local tolerance study in Cynomolgus 
monkeys (as part of the single dose escalation study) and the immunogenicity study have not been 
performed in GLP-compliance. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
A number of in vitro studies were conducted with turoctocog alfa to determine the activity of turoctocog 
alfa in two different thrombin generation assays and to investigate the interaction of turoctocog alfa 
with von Willebrand Factor (vWF) and with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Additionally, the cofactor 
activity and the rates of activation and inactivation of turoctocog alfa were determined. The results are 
shown in Table 7.

Table 7: 
In vitro studies 
The in vivo efficacy was documented and the dose-response relationship evaluated in two different 
studies (Study No. TEIm070501 and SAQ070601) in the haemophilia A mice (FVIII knock-out mice) 
model. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of turoctocog alfa were also evaluated in 
haemophilia A dogs (Study No. MiE070601) and compared to another licensed  FVIII product. The 
results are shown in Table 8.

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies have not been submitted. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Core endpoints of safety pharmacology testing (central nervous system, cardiovascular system, and 
respiratory system) have been addressed in the toxicology programme in Cynomolgus monkeys. In the 
single dose toxicity study potential effects on cardiac effects and blood pressure were investigated. The 
repeated dose toxicity study integrated the following parameters: blood pressure, electrocardiography, 
respiratory rate, neurological/CNS endpoints and urinalysis. 
No adverse effects on food consumption, behaviour or body temperature were observed.  
In the repeat dose toxicity study in the primate a statistical significance (p<0.05) with regard to mean 
systolic pressure was evident in week 2. However, this was attributed to decreased levels in the 
controls. Values in the dose groups at week 2 were within the range of values recorded pre-treatment.  
There was no consistent pattern in the data to indicate an effect of treatment on heart rate, ECG 
intervals or waveform, respiratory rate or depth.

Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were submitted. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics and toxicokinetics of turoctocog alfa were investigated in FVIII knock-out mice, 
Sprague Dawley rats, haemophilia A dogs, and Cynomolgus monkeys. Various bioassays have been 
developed to assess turoctocog alfa pharmacokinetics. In the PK studies, plasma samples were 
analysed for FVIIII coagulant activity (FVIII:C) by a two-stage chromogenic assay (COA) while antigen 
(ag) concentration was determined by an Enzyme Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay (ELISA). For the 
pivotal toxicokinetics in rats and monkeys, a chromogenic assay was validated and used. 
Anti-turoctocog alfa and anti-turoctocog alfa neutralising antibody assays were validated for the pivotal 
toxicity studies in rats and monkeys. Pharmacokinetics of turoctocog alfa was compared to those of 
other recombinant FVIII products, ReFacto and Advate.

turoctocog alfa (distribution)  
Absorption of turoctocog alfa was evaluated following intravenous administration, which is the intended 
clinical route of administration. Pharmacokinetic assessments comprised FVIII activity, initial plasma 
concentration (C0.25h), maximum observed concentration (Cmax), terminal half-life (t1/2), area 
under concentration versus time curve (AUC), AUC from zero to 24 hours (AUC0-24h), total body 
clearance (CL), volume of distribution after a single dose (Vz), volume of distribution at steady state 
(Vss).  
Non-compartmental analysis (NCA) was performed in male FVIII knock-out mice, haemophilia A dogs, 
Cynomolgus monkeys and in male and female Sprague Dawley rats. 
In study DKPF070802, the pharmacokinetics of various doses (8, 80, 180 or 280 IU/kg) of turoctocog 
alfa was determined following intravenous administration in 68 FVIII knock-out mice and compared to 
Assessment report  
EMA/612026/2013 
Page 23/108 
 
  
  
 
that of 280 IU/kg doses of two marketed FVIII products, Advate and ReFacto. Dose proportionality was 
found in the range of 80-280 IU/kg. Regarding the calculated PK parameters as obtained by NCA no 
major differences were observed in the half-lives (6.7-7.8h, chromogenic activity), clearances (10-11 
ml/h/kg, chromogenic activity) or volume of distributions (97-117 ml/kg, chromogenic activity) 
between turocotog alfa, ReFacto or Advate.

The PK/PD profile of turoctocog alfa was evaluated in haemophilia A dogs and compared to Advate 
(Study No. MiE070601). Pharmacokinetic analysis was carried out by non-compartmental analysis 
(NCA) of FVIII plasma activity (chromogenic assay). From the data the following parameters were 
estimated: Cmax, AUC0-t, T1/2, AUC0->∞, CL, MRT, and Vss. In addition two PK parameters used in the 
haemophilia field were calculated: the incremental recovery (K-value) and in vivo recovery (IVR). The 
pharmacokinetics of FVIII was determined following a single intravenous administration of 100 IU/kg 
turoctocog alfa and Advate in a cross-over design. FVIII was assayed in plasma samples by FVIII 
chromogenic and clot activity assays. The terminal t ½ for turoctocog alfa was in the range of 7.2–10.5 
hours. The PK parameters for turoctocog alfa and Advate were similar, but the two dogs had a different 
response towards the FVIII products, probably due to the presence of antibodies in dog K01. 
Nevertheless, the PK parameters for turoctocog alfa and Advate were similar within each individual dog 
and the obtained data are in agreement with published studies of FVIII compounds in haemophilia A 
dog. 
A quantitative whole body distribution study was performed in male C57Bl/6 and in male vWF KO mice 
with 125I-turoctocog alfa (Study No. 208356). The 125-iodine label was unspecific in the tyrosine 
amino acids of turoctocog alfa. Animals were dosed with 0.028 mg/kg of radiolabelled turoctocog alfa, 
Assessment report  
EMA/612026/2013 
Page 24/108 
 
  
  
 
 
corresponding to 295 IU/kg at 52μCi/kg. After a single dose of 125I- turoctocog alfa to C57Bl/6 mice a 
high amount of radioactivity was present in the liver and organs with high blood flow such as the kidney, 
lung and spleen. The corresponding tissue:blood ratios were 0.43 for liver, 0.48 and 0.26 for kidney 
medulla and kidney cortex respectively, 0.58 for lung and 0.39 for spleen. 
No metabolism or excretion studies have been submitted. 
No pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies have been submitted. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The toxicology program included single dose and repeat dose toxicity studies using rats and 
Cynomolgus monkeys as well as the evaluation of the local tolerance in New Zealand White rabbits, 
rats and male Cynomolgus monkeys. Additionally one immunogenicity study was performed in the rat. 
According to the applicant, most of the toxicity studies were conducted in compliance with GLP 
regulations, except the single dose escalation toxicity, one local tolerance study in Cynomolgus 
monkeys (as part of the single dose escalation study) and the immunogenicity study. 
Single dose toxicity 
In a non-GLP study, single dose toxicity was studied following a single intravenous administration at 
each dose level to male Cynomolgus monkeys. There were no decedents in the study and no clinical 
signs related to treatment were observed. In the absence of adverse local or systemic reactions to 
treatment, the single dose NOAEL was considered to be 5000 IU/kg. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeat dose toxicity studies were performed in Sprague Dawley rats and Cynomolgus monkeys for up 
to 2 weeks duration with daily intravenous dosing up to 1250 IU/kg in the rat and 5000 IU/kg in the 
monkey. These studies were performed in compliance with GLP.  
In  the  rat  studies,  toxicokinetics  and  immunogenicity  were  evaluated  and  in  the  monkey  studies 
toxicokinetics and safety pharmacology were investigated. 
In the rat study (study 211030) no decedents were observed. There were no toxicologically significant 
effects on clinical signs, body weights, food consumption, ophthalmoscopy, haematology, clinical 
chemistry, urinalysis, organ weights, and macroscopic or microscopic observations. Consistent with the 
species-foreign nature of human turoctocog alfa in rats, an antibody-specific immune response was 
generated in almost all treated animals along with a steadily reduced exposure from day 8 and until the 
end of dosing. Significant prolongation of mean APTT was seen in the recovery period in animals 
previously given 1250 U/kg/day. This effect was not considered to be adverse as there were no 
correlating clinical or histopathological findings. The non-immunogenic NOAEL was identified to be 1250 
IU/kg/day. 
In the monkey study (study 208012), turoctocog alfa was administered daily intravenously to male 
Cynomolgus monkeys for 14 days with dose levels of 50, 1000 and 5000 IU/kg/day. No 
treatment-related findings regarding safety pharmacology endpoints e.g. no effects on respiratory rate 
or depth, no effect on behavioural, autonomic or neurological measurements and no effect of treatment 
Assessment report  
EMA/612026/2013 
Page 25/108 
 
  
  
on heart rate, ECG intervals or waveform were observed. Consistent with the species-foreign nature of 
human FVIII in cynomolgus monkeys, antibodies developed in 22 out of 24 dosed animals. 18 of the 22 
monkeys had neutralising antibodies. As a result, APTT times increased in all animals with neutralising 
antibodies from day 10 to 14 (except in the animals dosed with 50 IU/kg/day where only one animal had 
an increase in APTT) and the effect was further pronounced in the recovery period.  
APTT values were markedly prolonged on Day 14 in animals dosed with 1000 and 5000 IU/kg/day. In 
animals dosed with 50 IU/kg/day, there was also an increase in APTT at Day 14 except for in two 
animals without neutralising antibodies. There were no findings related to other adverse effects of 
turoctocog alfa in any of the animals and all findings in this study are considered to be related to the 
development of cross-reacting neutralising antibodies, resulting in acquired haemophilia. 
Based on the findings a NOAEL for immunogenicity-related effects (antibody formation to a 
species-foreign protein) could not be determined. The NOAEL for non-immunogenicity related toxicity 
was 5000 IU/kg/day. 
Genotoxicity 
No genotoxicity studies have been submitted. 
Carcinogenicity 
Nonclinical carcinogenicity studies have not been submitted. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have not been performed with turoctocog alfa. Fertility 
was assessed by histopathology or reproductive organs in the repeat dose toxicity study using sexually 
mature male and female rats. No effects on the reproductive organs were seen. 
Toxicokinetic data 
The toxicokinetics of turoctocog alfa following a single intravenous administration of 50, 250, 500, 
1250, 2500 or 5000 IU/kg were determined in male Cynomolgus monkeys with two animals per dose 
level (Study No. 207402). Systemic exposure to turoctocog alfa was confirmed in all animals with the 
exception of one animal given 50 IU/kg, due to high pre-dose plasma FVIII activity. Turoctocog alfa was 
assayed in plasma samples by a FVIII chromogenic activity assay. The individual t½, estimated for 
animals dosed with 250, 1250, 2500 and 5000 IU/kg, was in the range of 6.4 to 12 hours over the dose 
range. Estimated mean CL values of 0.00575 and 0.00755 (l/h/kg) were found following doses of 2500 
and 5000 IU/kg, respectively. Both the C0.25h and AUC0-24h values increased with dose. The increase 
in exposure was proportional to dose based on C0.25h and less than proportional to dose based on 
AUC0-24h.  
The toxicokinetics of turoctocog alfa after repeated dosing was evaluated in male and female Sprague 
Dawley rats, following i.v. administration once-daily for 14 consecutive days at dose levels 50, 250 or 
1250 IU/kg (Study No. 211030). Blood samples for toxicokinetics were taken from animals on day 1, 
day 8 and day 14, with a further exposure sample on Day 5. Endogenous FVIII activity was high in 
Assessment report  
EMA/612026/2013 
Page 26/108 
 
  
  
control animals, with AUC0-24h ranging from 30.2 to 43.8*IU/ml and Cmax ranging from 1.54 to 1.97 
IU/ml. The terminal half-life (t1/2) could only be estimated for two composite profiles on day 1 at dose 
level 250 IU/kg and was 4.4 hours in males and 4.7 hours in females. For animals dosed i.v. on day 1 
with 50, 250 or 1250 IU/kg, exposure to turoctocog alfa could generally be demonstrated above 
endogenous activity up to approximately 2 to 6 hours after dosing. Repeated administration once daily 
for 14 consecutive days at different dose levels, resulted in exposure to turoctocog alfa generally 
decreasing in both males and females due to antibodies formation.  
The toxicokinetics of turoctocog alfa was evaluated in male Cynomolgus monkeys, following daily 
intravenous administration for 14 days at dose levels of 50, 1000 and 5000 IU/kg (Study No. 208012). 
The reversibility and/or delayed onset of any effects at the selected dose levels, over a 6-day recovery 
period, were also assessed. Systemic exposure increased approximately proportionally to the increase 
in dose based on C0.25h but less than proportionally based on AUC0-24h. The t½ estimated for animals 
dosed with 1000 and 5000 IU/kg on Day 1, was in the range of 5 to 12 hours. The lack of exposure at 
day 14 in the monkey following repeated dosing corresponded with the presence of neutralising 
antibodies. The antibodies were cross-reactive to endogenous FVIII in Cynomolgus monkeys.  
Local Tolerance  
In Study No.211272, the local tolerance of turoctocog alfa at the injection sites four days after a single 
perivenous, intravenous and intraarterial injection of turoctocog alfa was assessed in the ears of 
rabbits. A single dose of 0.15 ml (corresponding to approximately 20 IU/kg) per animal of turoctocog 
alfa administered either perivenously, intravenously or intraarterially in the ears of rabbits did not result 
in any signs of treatment-related systemic toxicity or treatment-related local clinical reactions. The 
injections caused very mild histopathological changes at the injection sites, characterised by 
inflammatory changes or haemorrhage. All changes reported at the turoctocog alfa treated sites were 
either comparable or had lower incidence and severity compared to the placebo-treated injection sites. 
The local tolerance of turoctocog alfa was further assessed as an integrated part of the single and repeat 
dose toxicology studies in monkeys and the repeat dose toxicology study in rats (Study No. 207402, 
211030 and 208012). In all these studies there was no evidence of local systemic toxicity. 
Other toxicity studies 
The non-GLP Study No.210401 aimed to investigate if daily intravenous dosing of turoctocog alfa to 
Sprague Dawley rats led to generation of anti-drug antibodies affecting exposure. Generation of 
antibodies was investigated after 2 and 4 weeks of dosing to evaluate the development of antibodies 
and to recommend an optimal duration of dosing in subsequent studies. Animals were treated with a 
daily intravenous (bolus) dose of 1250 IU/kg turoctocog alfa for 14 or 28 days. 
No adverse clinical signs or injection site reactions were observed throughout the study. Analysis for 
anti-turoctocog alfa antibodies was made pre-dose, Day 16 and Day 30. All pre-dose samples were 
antibody negative and all samples from dosed animals were antibody positive. Antibodies against 
turoctocog alfa were present in all animals at Day 16 and 30. The titre increased from Day 16 to Day 30 
indicating that the level of anti-turoctocog alfa antibodies increased over time. Together with a 
decreased FVIII activity within the first two weeks of dosing, two weeks dose duration was selected for 
the pivotal repeat dose toxicity study.

The content of product-related impurities at release and at end of shelf life in non-clinical batches was 
within the specification limits. Based on the higher dose levels (100-fold to clinical dose for bleeding 
prevention, and 25-fold to maximum dose on demand) administered in the non-clinical studies in 
Cynomolgus monkeys at NOAEL, these impurities are considered adequately qualified compared to 
maximum exposure of impurities at the recommended clinical dose at end-of-shelf-life- specification.No 
safety concerns have been raised. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Turoctocog alfa is a recombinant human coagulation factor VIII and once activated by thrombin 
cleavage the resulting rFVIIIa has the same structure as endogenous FVIIIa. According to the European 
Medicines Agency Guideline “Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for 
human use”, an environmental risk assessment is not required for proteins. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacodynamic effects of turoctocog alfa could be demonstrated in several in vitro studies. These 
studies demonstrated a dose dependent increase in thrombin generation, similar for turocotcog alfa and 
other licensed FVIII products. All products compared bind VWF with very similar affinities. 
The in vivo studies were performed in the FVIII knock-out mouse (mouse haemophilia A model) and in 
haemophilia A dogs. In these studies, it was demonstrated that the effect of turoctocog alfa (200 IU/kg) 
was comparable to another licensed recombinant FVII product supporting the potential use of 
turoctocog alfa as replacement therapy in human haemophilia A patients. In the limited cross-over 
study in haemophilia A dogs, turocotcog alfa demonstrated a similar PK and PD profile as a comparator. 
In summary, turoctocog alfa is capable of normalising whole blood clotting time and showed similar 
activity profile over time as a licensed recombinant FVIII product. No secondary pharmacodynamic 
effects are expected and thus secondary pharmacodynamic studies were not submitted. 
In accordance with the ICH S6 guideline, safety pharmacology aspects have been integrated into the 
toxicology programme. No adverse effects regarding safety pharmacology were observed. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters of turoctocog alfa were investigated in FVIII knock-out mice, Sprague 
Dawley rats, haemophilia A dogs, and Cynomolgus monkeys after single and repeated intravenous 
administration. The pharmacokinetics for turoctocog alfa and the licensed recombinant FVIII products 
in FVIII knock-out mice was comparable and no major differences were seen in the calculated PK 
parameters (t½, CL or volume of distribution). 
The PK parameters obtained in two haemophilia A dogs are in agreement with published data for FVIII 
in both haemophilia A patients and haemophilia A dogs. 
Due to the high endogenous FVIII activity in the rat, sufficient data could not be generated to be able 
to draw conclusions regarding dose linearity. Both in rats and monkeys, a decrease in exposure was 
observed after repeated dosing, likely due to formation of cross reacting and neutralising antibodies to 
endogenous FVIII.

In a quantitative whole distribution study in male C56Bl/6 mice a high amount of radioactivity could be 
detected in the liver and organs with high blood flow such as the kidney, lung and spleen after a single 
dose of 125I- turoctocog alfa. 
Overall, the results of the PK studies in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys demonstrated that turoctocog alfa 
has the expected bioavailability and pharmacokinetic properties in comparison to the licensed 
recombinant FVIII products. 
The toxicology programme for marketing authorisation application of turoctocog alfa included one 
single dose and two repeat dose toxicity studies using rats and Cynomolgus monkeys, as well as the 
evaluation of the local tolerance in New Zealand White rabbits, male Cynomolgus monkeys and rats as 
part of the single dose and the repeated dose study. 
In the single dose monkey study, no findings related to treatment were observed and a NOAEL of 5000 
IU/kg was determined. 
During the administration of turoctocog alfa in the 2-week repeated dose study in monkeys, animals in 
all turoctocog alfa dose groups developed cross-reacting neutralising antibodies resulting in clinical and 
pathological signs of acquired haemophilia. However, there were no signs of adverse effects related to 
turoctocog alfa. In the 2 week repeat dose toxicity study in rats, an antibody-specific immune response 
was generated in almost all treated animals. The findings in this study are considered not to be directly 
related to turoctocog alfa but are indirect effects due to immunogenicity of this human protein in rats. 
Immunogenicity in rats towards a human FVIII is not considered predictive for the clinical situation. 
Based on these observations, it was concluded that turoctocog alfa toxicity studies of longer duration 
than 2 weeks would not provide additional relevant information or contribute to the safety evaluation to 
human use. 
In the Cynomolgus monkey, single intravenous administrations of turoctocog alfa at six discrete dose 
levels, ranging from 50 to 5000 IU/kg were all well tolerated. In the rat model intravenous 
administration of turoctocog alfa to Crl:CD(SD) rats at 50, 250 or 1250 U/kg/day was well-tolerated. 
The NOAEL for immunogenicity-related effects (antibody formation to a species-foreign protein) could 
not be determined in the monkey study. The NOAEL for non-immunogenic related toxicity in the 
monkey was 5000 IU/kg/day and 1250 IU/kg/day in the rat, i.e. the highest doses tested. These 
findings are in accordance with findings in preclinical studies with other commercially available FVIII 
products. 
All excipients and impurities found in the turoctocog alfa drug product are considered adequately 
non-clinical qualified for clinical use at end-of-shelf-life-specification. 
The local tolerance of turoctocog alfa was evaluated by peri- and intravenous as well as intraarterial 
administration to New Zealand White Rabbits. A single dose of 0.15 ml (corresponding to approximately 
20 IU/kg) per animal of turoctocog alfa administered in the ears of rabbits did not result in any signs of 
treatment-related systemic toxicity or treatment-related local clinical reactions. The injections caused 
very mild histopathological changes at the injection sites, characterised by inflammatory changes or 
haemorrhage. All changes reported at the turoctocog alfa treated sites were either comparable or had 
lower incidence and severity compared to the placebo-treated injection sites. 
According to ICH S6 guideline recommendations, the omission of studies on genotoxicity, 
carcinogenicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity is justified.

2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In general, the data from the pharmacology and pharmacokinetic studies were considered sufficient to 
support marketing authorisation of turoctocog alfa. The non-clinical data are considered appropriate for 
the marketing authorisation application of turoctocog alfa as recombinant blood coagulation factor VIII. 
The results of the PK studies in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys treated with turoctocog alfa showed 
comparable bioavailability and pharmacokinetic properties to other licensed FVIII products. The 
immunogenicity findings in the single and multiple dose toxicity studies in rats and monkeys pose no 
concern as the immune reaction to turoctocog alfa was expected. Furthermore, the results of the 
toxicity studies showed no unexpected results with turoctocog alfa treatment.

Analytical methods 
The FVIII activity of turoctocog alfa was determined using both the one-stage activated partial 
thromboplastin time (aPTT) assay (clotting assay) and a two-stage chromogenic substrate assay 
(chromogenic assay) in the clinical trials assessing the pharmacokinetic profile of turoctocog alfa. 
Detection of FVIII inhibitors was performed using the Nijmegen modified Bethesda assay. A cut-off 
point for clinical relevant levels of inhibitors was set to ≥ 0.6 BU which corresponds to 66% remaining 
FVIII activity according to guideline recommendations. 
An international, multi-centre, randomised and blinded field study was designed to evaluate and 
compare assay performance of turoctocog alfa (2000 IU/mL vial, batch no. VR40187 [Lot C]) and 
Advate in spiked plasma (to reach levels of 0.03, 0.2, 0.6 and 0.9 IU/mL) from patients with 
haemophilia A at different clinical laboratories with the methodology and reagents routinely used in the 
laboratories. The result of the chromogenic/one-stage clotting assay is presented below.

Pharmacokinetics data in the target population 
A total of 61 patients with haemophilia A have participated in trials which included full pharmacokinetic 
assessment of turoctocog alfa. As 22 of these patients had pharmacokinetic profiles determined in both 
Trial 3522 and Trial 3543, the total number of pharmacokinetic assessments of turoctocog alfa was 83.

The age range of enrolled patients was 1−54 years. There were only two adolescent patients (12−<18 
years) included in the trials. A total of 28 patients were children (<12 years). All patients were 
previously treated patients with ≥  150 exposure days (patients ≥ 12 years) or ≥  50 exposure days 
(patients <12 years) to any FVIII product. 
The pharmacokinetics of turoctocog alfa was investigated in four clinical pharmacology trials in patients 
with haemophilia A (studies NN77008-3522, NN7008-3893, NN77008-3600, NN7008-4015). In 
addition, a phase 3 trial (NN7008-3543) contributed to the assessment, where the pharmacokinetics of 
turoctocog alfa was assessed following 3−6 months of preventive dosing in patients who had completed 
Trial NN7008-3522. 
The pharmacokinetic parameters of turoctocog alfa were based on FVIII activity (FVIII:C) 
measurements. 
Pharmacokinetics in adult and adolescent patients 
Study NN7008-3522: In this first human dose trial, the pharmacokinetics of turoctocog alfa was 
compared to the pharmacokinetics of Advate in patients with haemophilia A. Analyses were performed 
on three analysis sets in this trial: unadjusted data, data adjusted for actual dose and strength 
(dose-adjusted) and dose-adjusted data excluding outliers. 
Three patients have been excluded from analysis since these deviations may potentially affect the 
pharmacokinetic evaluations: In two patients, turoctocog alfa plasma profiles were not indicative of a 
normal i.v. short infusion administration and one patient  had one outlying value in the turoctocog alfa 
plasma profile 30 min post-dosing. In addition, one patient had a pre-turoctocog alfa FVIII activity of 
0.105 IU/mL. Furthermore, the t½ from one patient has been excluded as it was considered an outlying 
value (48.5 hours).  
The pharmacokinetics of turoctocog alfa after single-dose administration i.v. to adult and adolescent 
previously treated patients with haemophilia A was investigated in a total of 23 patients above 12 years 
of age (mean age: 24 years; range: 13− 54 years). A total of 20 patients were included in the full 
analysis set, adjusted for dose and excluding outliers:

After the end of the turoctocog alfa infusion, the FVIII activity level declined in an exponential way with 
a tendency to a slight biexponential decay pattern. In 17 out of 23 patients the FVIII activity was 
measurable for up to 48 hours post-dosing of turoctocog alfa. The mean residual activity levels at 48 
hours post-dosing was 0.03 IU/mL, ranging from 0.0125 IU/mL (LLoQ) to 0.13 IU/mL. The remaining 6 
patients had FVIII values below the LLoQ at 48 hours post-dosing. The mean Vss of turoctocog alfa 
indicated limited distribution into the extravascular space. 
Study NN7008-3543: Part A (PK session) of this pivotal phase 3 trial investigated PK following 
preventive dosing in patients who completed Trial NN7008-3522. The pharmacokinetic profile after the 
first injection of turoctocog alfa, obtained in Trial NN7008-3522, were compared to the results obtained 
after 3− 6 months of preventive dosing with turoctocog alfa in Trial NN7008-3543.  
A total of 22 patients participated in the pharmacokinetic part of Trial NN7008-3543. As data from 3 
patients were excluded from Trial NN7008-3522 and data from 4 patients were excluded from Trial 
NN7008-3543, the compare analysis set comprised 15 patients. The patients received 36− 65 doses of 
turoctocog alfa prior to the pharmacokinetic session in Trial NN7008-3543.  
The mean FVIII activity at each of the specific time points in the interval 15 min to 4 hours post-dosing 
(i.e., at time points 15 min., 30 min. and 1 hour) was slightly higher in Trial NN7008-3543 (after 
preventive dosing for 3− 6 months) compared to Trial NN7008-3522 (first dose of turoctocog alfa). This 
difference was mainly noted for the clotting assay. 
The individual pharmacokinetic profiles showed that no patients had lower FVIII activity following 3− 6 
months of preventive dosing (Trial NN7008-3543) compared to the first dosing with turoctocog alfa 
(Trial NN7008-3522). This was also the case when examining the full analysis set including outliers.

Pharmacokinetics in children 
Study NN7008-3545: The pharmacokinetics of a single dose of turoctocog alfa in children (0− <12 
years) with haemophilia A was investigated in this open-label, non-controlled trial. The mean age of the 
young children was 3.7 years (range 1− 5 years) and the mean age of the older children was 8.2 years 
(range 6− 11 years). Sampling time points were at pre-dose and at 30 min., 1, 4, 10, 24 and 48 hours 
post-dosing. The results are shown in Table 13 and 14.

The mean AUC in young children and older children was 30% and 22% lower than in adults in 
NN7008-3522 (14.22 IU*h/mL) when using the clotting assay and 35% and 23% lower than in adults 
(18.70 IU*h/mL) when using the chromogenic assay. 
Accordingly, the CL of turoctocog alfa was higher in children compared to adults: the mean CL in young 
children and older children was 67% and 34% higher than in adults in Trial 3522 (3.74 mL/h/kg) when 
using the clotting assay and 60% and 29% higher than in adults (2.87 mL/h/kg) when using the 
chromogenic assay. 
The mean t½ of turoctocog alfa in young children and older children was 29% and 26% shorter than in 
adults in NN7008-3522 (10.83 hours) when using the clotting assay and 0.4% and 6% shorter than in 
adults (10.04 hours) when using the chromogenic assay. 
Two patients did not participate in the pharmacokinetic session with previous product due to available 
historical pharmacokinetic data. However, historical data of both patients were excluded because of 
questionable quality. 
A pharmacokinetic assessment of the patient’s previous FVIII product was also investigated prior to first 
administration of turoctocog alfa. Each patient received one dose of their previous FVIII product (50 
IU/kg) and one dose of turoctocog alfa (50 IU/kg) in this trial. In a post-hoc statistical analysis, the 90% 
confidence interval for all primary endpoints were within the interval of 0.8− 1.25, with the exception of 
the incremental recovery which was slightly lower for the previous product in the chromogenic assay as 
compared to turoctocog alfa. 
Supportive pharmacokinetic data 
Study NN7008-3893: In this multi-centre, open-label trial the PK of two production lots of turoctocog 
alfa was investigated in four adult patients with severe haemophilia A. The results are shown in Table

The strength of 3000 IU of the turoctocog alfa drug product has been investigated in a recently 
completed clinical trial (NN7008-4015). The trial design is outlined below. 
Assessment report  
EMA/612026/2013 
Page 37/108 
 
  
  
Trial 4015 was a multi-centre, randomised open-labelled trial investigating the PK of 4 lots of turoctocog 
alfa (3 lots of 2000 IU/vial and 1 lot of 3000 IU/vial) in patients with severe haemophilia A (FVIII<1%). 
The trial was performed as a two-period, incomplete block, cross-over trial, where each patient was 
randomised to receive two different lots of turoctocog alfa. None of the patients had previously 
participated in the clinical development programme for turoctocog alfa. A total of 15 patients completed 
the trial. 
The trial included two PK sessions (Visits 2 and 3) and prior to each of these visits there was a wash-out 
period of at least 4 days since the last FVIII dosing. At each of the two PK sessions, the patients received 
a single i.v. dose of 50 IU/kg turoctocog alfa. Different combinations of the 4 lots (A, B, C and D) were 
administered to different patients, so that each patient received two different lots (one at Visit 2 and 
one at Visit 3) and all combinations of the 4 lots were represented in the trial population. The period 
between each visit was to be kept as short as possible. Blood samples for assessment of PK were taken 
at the PK sessions at pre-dose and at 10 time points up to 48 hours after administration of turoctocog 
alfa. Blood samples for assessment of FVIII inhibitors were collected at screening (Visit 1), pre-dosing 
at Visits 2 and 3, as well as 48 hours after dosing at Visit 3. 
Each of the three 2000 IU lots was compared to the two other 2000 IU lots and 2-sided 90% confidence 
intervals were provided. In addition, test for difference between the three 2000 IU lots were performed 
and if these were not statistically different at the 5% level, the three 2000 IU lots were pooled and 
compared to the 3000 IU lot. 
The results are presented in Figure 3 and 4.

Special populations 
The trials were global and included patients from Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, Lithuania, Macedonia, 
Malaysia, Poland, Russian Federation, Switzerland, Turkey, the UK and the US. The majority of the 
patients included in the trials were White (23/33 adults/adolescent and 23/28 children) and of 
non-Hispanic or Latino ethnicity.  
Japanese patients 
Study NN7008-3600: Study NN7008-3600 was conducted in Japanese patients. This was an open-level, 
single-dose study to investigate the pharmacokinetic properties of turoctocog alfa in 6 Japanese 
patients with haemophilia A. The results are shown in Table 16.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No pharmacodynamics studies have been submitted. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetic parameters of turoctocog alfa were based on FVIII activity (FVIII:C) 
measurements. This parameter is known to correlate to clinical efficacy of FVIII products. 
Assessment report  
EMA/612026/2013 
Page 40/108 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
All pharmacokinetic studies with turoctocog alfa were conducted in previously treated patients with 
severe haemophilia A (FVIII ≤1%). The analysis of plasma samples (turoctocog alfa activity) was 
conducted using both the one-stage clotting assay and the chromogenic assay.  
In an international study involving 36 laboratories, the assay performance of NovoEight in FVIII:C 
assays was evaluated and compared to a marketed full length recombinant FVIII product. The study 
showed that comparable and consistent results were obtained for both products and that NovoEight can 
be reliably measured in plasma without the need of a separate NovoEight standard. 
The patient population, number of subjects, dose of recombinant factor VIII, evaluated PK parameters, 
sampling time points, applied assays and number of lots (three) used in these clinical studies complied 
with the Guideline on clinical investigation of recombinant and human plasma-derived factor VIII 
products (EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009). The comparison between 250 IU and 3000 IU, strength 
which is also intended to be marketed, was not performed as recommended in the guideline. However, 
the applicant did provide data in the paediatric trial that no statistical difference was observed in values 
for incremental recovery after dosing with turoctocog alfa from either 250 IU/vial or 2000 IU/vial. 
Further, the current data of the recently completed clinical trial (NN7008-4015) investigating the PK of 
4 lots of turoctocog alfa (3 lots of 2000 IU/vial and 1 lot of 3000 IU/vial) showed that there was no 
difference between the pooled 2000 IU lots compared to the 3000 IU lot for both chromogenic and 
clotting assay, respectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that the PK characteristics of turoctocog alfa 
were not influenced by the strength.  
Pharmacokinetics of turoctocog alfa was evaluated in five trials (first human dose trial, PK trial for two 
lots, PK in Japanese patients, pivotal phase 3 trial, paediatric trial) in a total of 61 previously treated 
male patients with severe haemophilia A from 1 to 54 years of age.  
In the first human dose trial (Trial NN7008-3522), the PK of turoctocog alfa was compared to the 
pharmacokinetics of Advate. The pharmacokinetic assessment of turoctocog alfa was investigated after 
single intravenous (i.v.) dose of 50 IU/kg body weight and blood sampling was done at regular intervals 
throughout a 48-hour period. Overall, the average PK characteristics of turoctocog alfa seemed to be 
comparable to those of Advate to a 90% confidence interval analysis. 
A repeat PK analysis was carried out in 15 subjects as Part A (PK session) of the pivotal phase 3 Trial 
NN7008-3543. Study subjects were given a single dose of 50 IU/kg of turoctocog alfa after 3-6 months 
of preventive dosing. The pharmacokinetic results 3− 6 months after the first injection of turoctocog 
alfa, as measured in Trial NN7008-3543, are considered comparable to the results obtained after the 
first dose of turoctocog alfa in Trial NN7008-3522. There is no indication for lower FVIII activity 
indicating a possible formation of inhibitory FVIII antibodies after multiple exposures. The applicant has 
submitted all the relevant data on the exclusion of four outliers. The data was considered acceptable. 
The differences in pharmacokinetic endpoints in study NN7008-3893 were mainly ascribed to slightly 
higher FVIII activity levels. There were also differences in the age-distribution of the patients, the mean 
age of the patients included in Trial 3893 was 33 years, whereas the mean age of the patients included 
in Trial 3522 was 24 years. 
In Study NN7009-3545 the PK in children (< 12 years) was investigated. It complies with the 
requirements of the guideline (EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009) and the agreed PIP. The results of the 
pharmacokinetic parameters are comparable between young children and older children. The lower 
AUC, higher CL and lower t½ seen in children in comparison to adults with haemophilia A following 
administration of turoctocog alfa have also been described for other FVIII products. There are only very 
Assessment report  
EMA/612026/2013 
Page 41/108 
 
  
  
small differences in mean t 1/2 between children and adults comparing the results of the chromogenic 
assay. In addition, the pharmacokinetic profiles of turoctocog alfa were quite similar to the 
pharmacokinetic profiles of the patients’ previous FVIII products in children with haemophilia A as also 
investigated in this trial. Overall, the observed variations of parameters e.g. incremental recovery in the 
post-hoc analysis are acceptable with regard to the pool of different previous products. The PK 
characteristics for the two adolescent patients correlate very well with the data of adults. The half-lives 
are markedly prolonged in comparison to the children’s population. 
The pharmacokinetic parameters were comparable between paediatric patients below 6 years of age 
and the paediatric patients from 6 to below 12 years of age. Some variation was observed in the 
pharmacokinetic parameters of turoctocog alfa between paediatric and adult patients. The higher CL 
and the shorter t ½ seen in paediatric patients compared to adult patients with haemophilia A may be 
due in part to the known higher plasma volume per kilogram body weight in younger patients. 
Pharmacokinetic characteristics of turoctocog alfa have not been studied in the following special 
populations: 1) Previously untreated patients; 2) Subjects over 65 years of age; 3) Subjects with 
impaired renal function; 4) Subjects with impaired hepatic function. The effects of ethnic background on 
PK characteristics have only been studied in Japanese patients.  
The justification of the applicant for not conducting dedicated PD studies was acceptable. 
In the first human dose trial NN7008-3522 there have been numerous protocol violations. Hence, the 
applicant identified some outliers based on following criteria: pre-dosing activity >5% due to 
inadequate wash-out, deviation of administered dose > 20% and profiles not indicative of a normal i.v. 
bolus administration. The post-hoc defined criteria are understood and the study can still be regarded 
as valid. PK characteristics [mean (range)] of turoctocog alfa in the pivotal PK trial (NN7008-3522) 
were for the chromogenic assay in a total of 20 patients (full analysis set, adjusted for dose and 
excluding outliers): Incremental recovery IU/mL/IU/kg 0.028 (0.006); Terminal half-life h 10.04 
(3.59); AUC IU/mL 18.70 (5.08); Total Clearance mL/h 209.7 (67.15).  
PK has been evaluated in only two adolescent patients (13 and 17 years old) in the studies 
NN7008-3522 and NN7008-3543. According to the guideline, PK evaluation in adolescent patients is not 
explicitly required. The results for these two patients were within the range of the results for adult 
patients above 18 years in Trial NN7008-3522. 
The lack of interaction studies are acceptable as no interaction is expected and thus, they are not 
required.  The FVIII measurements, as used for pharmacokinetic assessment, are known to correlate to 
clinical efficacy of FVIII products. Thus, the coagulation activities are to be considered as 
pharmacodynamic in nature, as they reflect the biologic response to turoctocog alfa and thus no PD 
studies are required. This is considered acceptable. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the data on pharmacokinetic of turoctocog alfa in adults, adolescent patients and children with 
severe Haemophilia A is regarded acceptable and comparable with other FVIII products. Concerns 
regarding the numerous protocol violations in PK study NN7008-3522 and the exclusion of outliers have 
been addressed satisfactorily.

The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, 
on the location and extent of the bleeding and the patient’s clinical condition. 
The number of units of factor VIII is expressed in International Units (IU), which are related to the 
current WHO standard for factor VIII products. The activity of factor VIII in plasma is expressed either 
as percentage (relative to normal level human plasma) or in International Units (relative to an 
International Standard for factor VIII in plasma).  
One International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one ml 
normal human plasma.  
On demand treatment 
The calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 International 
Unit (IU) factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 2 IU/dl. The required 
dose is determined using the following formula: 
Required units = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (%) (IU/dl) x 0.5 (IU/kg per IU/dl). 
The amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to the 
clinical effectiveness in the individual case. 
In the case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given 
plasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dl) in the corresponding period. The following table can be 
used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery:

Repeat infusion every 8-24 hours 
until adequate wound healing, then 
therapy for at least another 7 days 
to maintain a factor VIII activity of 
30% to 60% (IU/dl) 
Prophylaxis 
For long term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A. The usual 
recommended doses are 20-40 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight every second day or 20-50 IU of 
factor VIII per kg body weight 3 times weekly. In some cases, especially in younger patients, shorter 
dosage intervals or higher doses may be necessary.  
Treatment monitoring 
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor VIII levels is advised to guide the 
dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated injections. In the case of major surgical 
interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation 
analysis (plasma factor VIII activity) is indispensable. Individual patients may vary in their response to 
factor VIII, achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives. 
Surgery 
There is no experience in surgery of paediatric patients. 
Older people  
There is no experience in patients > 65 years.  
Paediatric population 
For long term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients below the age of 12, doses of 25-50 IU of factor 
VIII per kg body weight every second day or 25-60 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight 3 times weekly

are recommended. For paediatric patients above the age of 12 the dose recommendations are the same 
as for adults. 
The methos of administration of turoctocog alfa is intravenous use.  
The recommended infusion rate for NovoEight is 1-2 ml/min. The rate should be determined by the 
patient’s comfort level.

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The clinical efficacy of turoctocog alfa was investigated in three studies, the main pivotal study 
NN7008-3543, the paediatric study N7008-3545 and the extension study N007-3568. The flow of 
patients in the clinical development programme is presented in Figure 5.

2.5.2.  Main studies 
Study NN7008-3543: A multi-centre, open-label, non-controlled trial on safety and efficacy 
of turoctocog alfa in prevention and treatment of bleeds in previously treated patients 
with haemophilia A 
Sub-trial: Safety and efficacy of turoctocog alfa in prevention and treatment of bleeding 
during surgical procedures in patients with haemophilia A 
Methods 
The trial was designed as a multi-centre, multi-national, open-label, single-arm efficacy and safety trial 
in patients with haemophilia A and a FVIII activity ≤1%. 
The trial had three parts: 
Part A included patients who completed the pharmacokinetic trial (NN7008- 3522). 
Part B included patients who participated in the present trial (NN7008-3543) and who did not 
participate in the pharmacokinetic trial (NN7008-3522). 
Part C included patients from part A or part B undergoing surgical procedures.

Treatments 
Preventive treatment and dose adjustments 
This was a single arm trial with all patients receiving prophylactic FVIII treatment. The initial dose was 
20 IU/kg administered every second day or three times per week to achieve a trough level ≥0.01 IU/mL 
or above the assay lower limit of quantification (LLoQ) of the clinic. The frequency of dosing (either 
every second day or three times per week) was selected at the investigator’s discretion. The frequency 
of dosing could be changed at a visit if deemed necessary by the investigator. If the trough level was 
Assessment report  
EMA/612026/2013 
Page 49/108 
 
  
  
below the assay LLoQ of the clinic, the dose level could be increased by 5 IU/kg as decided by the 
investigator to a level that secured prevention of bleeds.  
Dose adjustments could be performed at planned as well as at unscheduled visits. If the trough level 
was ≥0.01 IU/mL or above the assay LLoQ of the clinic and a bleed occurred, the dose level was 
recommended to be increased until no bleeding occurred as assessed clinically by the investigator. 
The bleeding preventive treatment was home treatment with i.v. self-injection by the patient or a 
support person. 
Treatment of bleeds and dose adjustments 
In case of acute mild/moderate bleeds, the standard treatment was dosing of turoctocog alfa to aim at 
a post-infusion turoctocog alfa level of at least 0.50 IU/mL that could be repeated, if needed. All bleeds 
had to be reported to the site within 24 hours. For treatment of a severe bleed, doses up to 200 IU/kg 
per day could be used at the discretion of the investigator.  
If the effect of turoctocog alfa on the bleed was insufficient, another FVIII product could be selected at 
the discretion of the investigator. If treatment with another FVIII product was initiated, the patient was 
to be withdrawn from the trial. 
Treatment of patients who participated in part C (Visit C1 and Visit C2) 
Trial periods during surgery 
The trial period for the individual patient was divided into two time periods 
•  Surgery period (C1) consisted of pre-surgery Day, Day 1, Day 2, Day 3, Day 4, Day 5, Day 6 
and Day 7 where Day 1 was the day of surgery. 
•  Surgical recovery period (C2) consisted of Day 8 and until it was deemed the last appropriate 
day for trial product infusion after surgery (return to preventive treatment). 
Dose adjustments during surgery 
Loading dose: All patients received a preoperative loading dose of turoctocog alfa immediately prior to 
the surgical procedure. The dose was according to the standard practice at the site. 
Surgery period: On the day of surgery and until Day 7 (included): turoctocog alfa was dose adjusted 
aiming for a trough level above 0.50 IU/mL. 
Surgical recovery period: Day 8 to last day of the surgical recovery period (if relevant): turoctocog alfa 
was dosed according to local guidelines.

Patient-reported outcomes 
Several questionnaires were used to assess disease and age-group specific quality of life (QOL) and 
treatment satisfaction: age specific versions of HAEMO-QOL HEMO-SAT, EQ-5D (European Quality of 
Life - 5 Dimensions) were used. 
Sample size 
To be able to conclude adequate safety with regard to inhibitor formation the upper 1-sided 97.5% 
confidence limit for the incidence rate of FVIII inhibitor needed to be below 6.8%. If 3 inhibitors out of 
127 patients were observed the upper 1-sided 97.5% confidence limit was below 6.8%. In order to 
allow for a 10% withdrawal rate before the 50 exposure days, the trial was planned to have 140 patients 
dosed with turoctocog alfa. If the true inhibitor rate was 2% (in line with what has been seen for other 
FVIII products) then the chance of seeing 3 or less inhibitors out of 140 dosed patients was 69%. 
Therefore, the trial aimed to dose approximately 140 patients and to have 127 patients with a minimum 
of 50 exposure days. 
Randomisation 
The patients were not randomised as this is a single arm trial. 
Blinding (masking) 
The patients were not blinded as this is an open label trial. 
Statistical methods 
Aside the analysis for antibody development, the most important efficacy endpoint for bleeding 
prevention was the annualised bleeding rate. This was estimated using a Poisson model allowing for 
overdispersion. Haemostatic effect of turoctocog alfa was evaluated according to a predefined 
Assessment report  
EMA/612026/2013

four-grade scale: None, moderate, good or excellent, and was to be presented using counts and 
percentages of bleeding episodes. If the haemostatic response was rated as excellent or good, the 
treatment of the bleed was counted as a success. If the haemostatic response was rated as moderate 
or none, the treatment was counted as a failure. As a conservative approach, the missing ratings were 
included as treatment failures. 
Data arising from other endpoints were analysed in a descriptive manner.

Conduct of the study 
There were 22 substantial amendments to the protocol and some of these amendments changed the 
inclusion, exclusion and withdrawal criteria. The most important change occurred with amendment 14 
after consultation with the FDA, which introduced a change in the primary endpoint from efficacy to 
safety. 
There were in total 33 protocol deviations at the patient level. The distribution of the deviations is 
presented in Table 19. 
Table 19: 
Protocol deviations on patient level 
A total of 102 deviations were related to laboratory samples. Most of these were missing samples or 
samples taken outside of the sampling window. A total of 103 deviations were related to the 
assessments described in the protocol. Missed blood samples and blood samples taken outside the 
sampling window were also included in this category. A total of 71 deviations were reported in this 
category. These were mainly due to patients not following the dose regimen, patients taking wrong 
doses, issues with drug accountability and issues with IVRS/IWRS.

Numbers analysed 
Part A and B 
All 150 patients who were dosed with turoctocog alfa were included in the full analysis set (FAS) on 
which all the efficacy analyses, including analyses of PRO, are based. None of the exposed patients were 
excluded from the analyses, except for the duration from first trial product administration to Visit 7 was 
used instead of during the entire period for one patient.  This decision was made prior to database lock. 
Part C 
A total of 9 surgeries in 9 patients were performed during the trial. Eight of these were major surgeries 
and 1 was a minor surgery. Only one of the surgeries was done in an adolescent patient. 
Outcomes and estimation 
The majority of the patients (82.7%) followed the three times per week dosing schedule, 16.7% were 
dosed every second day and one patient (0.7%) changed dosing schedule from three times per week to 
every second day. 
Consumption of turoctocog alfa 
The mean total consumption per month per patient for prevention and treatment of bleeds was 338 
IU/kg/patient ranging from 222 to 747 IU/kg/patient and higher for patients in good compliance than 
for patients who were less compliant. The mean total consumption for prevention, treatment of bleeds 
and surgery in the entire trial period was 2156 IU/kg/patient ranging from 256 to 5420 IU/kg/patient. 
Assessment report  
EMA/612026/2013 
Page 57/108 
 
  
  
 
 
Prevention of bleeds 
A total of 11873 preventive doses of turoctocog alfa were taken during the trial and the mean 
preventive dose was 24.4 IU/kg ranging from 12.8 to 97.4 U/kg. The mean consumption per month for 
prevention was 309 IU/kg/month and for patients in good compliance it was 313 IU/kg/month, while for 
patients who were less compliant it was 263 IU/kg/month. The same pattern was seen with the yearly 
consumption where the overall mean was 3812 IU/kg/year and 3841 IU/kg/year for patients in good 
compliance and 3412 IU/kg/year for patients who were less compliant. 
Treatment of bleeds 
A total of 813 doses were taken during the trial for treatment of 499 bleeds and the mean dose for 
treatment of a bleed was 30.4 IU/kg/dose ranging from 9.8 to 61.1 IU/kg/dose. The mean consumption 
used for treatment of bleeds (from start to stop of the bleed) was 45.6 IU/kg/bleed. The reason that the 
mean dose for treatment of a bleed was lower than the mean consumption from start to stop of a bleed 
was that some bleeds were treated with more than one dose. The mean consumption from the time the 
bleed stopped until the patient returned to preventive regimen was 14.2 IU/kg/bleed. The consumption 
of turoctocog alfa used for treatment of bleeds was slightly higher for patients in good compliance than 
for less compliant patients. 
Efficacy of turoctocog alfa when used for prevention of bleeds 
Annualised bleeding rates 
The annualised bleeding rates were estimated using a Poisson model allowing for overdispersion and 
presented with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Almost one third of the patients did not have a 
bleed during the trial. The total estimated mean bleeding rate was 5.55 bleeds/patient/year for 
adolescents and 6.68 bleeds/patient/year for adults. 
The estimated mean bleeding rate for spontaneous bleeds was 4.32 bleeds/patient/year (3.15 
bleeds/patient/year for adolescents and 4.55 bleeds/patient/year for adults). The rate of traumatic 
bleeds was 2.07 bleeds/patient/year for adolescents and 1.53 bleeds/patient/year for adults. 
The estimated mean bleeding rate for patients who were in good compliance was considerably lower 
(6.18 bleeds/patient/year) than for patients who were less compliant (10.55 bleeds/patient/year). 
The estimated mean bleeding rate for all patients varied between the countries with the lowest bleeding 
rate in Japan (1.34 bleeds/patient/year) and the highest in the Russian Federation (23.22 
bleeds/patient/year). The estimated bleeding rate among adolescents was also high in the Russian 
Federation (25.82 bleeds/patient/year), while in the remaining countries, that included adolescents, it 
was lower ranging from 0.0 in Spain to 5.89 bleeds/patient/year in US. 
The total median bleeding rate was 3.66 bleeds/patient/year.

Table 23: 
Annualised bleeding rates – full analysis set 
Efficacy of turoctocog alfa when used for treatment of acute bleeds 
A total of 499 bleeds were treated during the trial. The majority of the bleeds (66.5%) were 
spontaneous, 24.8% were caused by trauma and 8.6% were of other origin or with missing information. 
The bleeds were classified as mild/moderate in 90% of the cases and as severe in 9% of the cases. 
Information about severity was missing for 1% of the bleeds. 
The most frequent location of the bleeds was in a joint, which accounted for 75% of the bleeds and 65% 
of the total number of the bleeds were in a target joint.  
Haemostatic response 
The haemostatic response after treatment of a bleed with turoctocog alfa was evaluated on a 4-point 
scale as excellent, good, moderate or none. The haemostatic response was rated as excellent for 140 
(28%) of the bleeds, good for 263 (53%) of the bleeds, moderate for 62 (12%) of the bleeds, and none 
for 12 (2.4%) of the bleeds. For the remaining 22 (4%) of the bleeds, the haemostatic response was not 
rated.  
The success rate for treatment of bleeds was 84.5% (excluding bleeds for which there was no outcome 
reported). A more conservative approach (considering bleeds for which there was no reported outcome 
Assessment report  
EMA/612026/2013 
Page 59/108 
 
  
  
 
 
as treatment failures) gave a success rate of 80.8% for treatment of bleeds. It should be noted that only 
1 infusion was reported for treatment of 82% of the bleeds with missing haemostatic responses, 
suggesting that this proportion of the bleeds with missing haemostatic responses was successfully 
treated with turoctocog alfa. It should also be noted that in 10% of the bleeds the haemostatic response 
was rated as excellent even though more than 1 infusion was used to stop the bleed. 
Number of infusions of turoctocog alfa used for treatment of bleeds 
Of the 499 reported bleeds, 357 (71.5%) were stopped with 1 infusion of turoctocog alfa and 89 
(17.8%) were stopped with 2 infusions. Thus, 89.4% of the bleeds were stopped with one or two 
infusions of turoctocog alfa. One patient (patient number 183101) reported 26 infusions to stop a 
muscle bleed caused by a trauma. The duration of the bleed was 304 hours and the haemostatic 
response was rated as ‘good’. 
Some patients continued to take turoctocog alfa after they had reported the bleed as being stopped in 
order to prevent re-bleeding. When looking at the number of infusions from the start of the bleed until 
the prevention was resumed, 1 infusion was required for 313 (62.7%) bleeds and 2 infusions were 
required for 102 (20.4%) bleeds. The mean number of infusions required from start to stop of a bleed 
was 1.5 infusions/bleed and the median number of infusions was 1 infusion/bleed. 
Time to control of a bleed 
The mean duration from start to stop of a bleed was 16.4 hours ranging from 15 minutes to 304 hours. 
The mean time from start of a bleed and until the first administration of turoctocog alfa was 2.83 hours 
ranging from 0 to 56 hours and the mean time from the first administration of turoctocog alfa and until 
the bleed stopped was 13.6 hours ranging from 0 to 300 hours. 
Adolescents 
There were no apparent differences observed in the adolescent population in the analyses of bleeds and 
the same patterns and trends were seen as described above for the total population. However, the 
success rate for treatment of bleeds in the adolescent population was 71.6% which was approximately 
10% lower than for the total population. 
Efficacy of turoctocog alfa when used in surgery 
A total of 9 surgeries in 9 patients were performed during the trial. Eight of these were major surgeries 
and 1 was a minor surgery. Only one of the surgeries was done in an adolescent patient. The surgery 
indications included arthropathy and chronic pain in left knee for 1 patient, synovialitis for 1 patient, 
semi-impacted tooth and removal of tooth root for 1 patient, arthropathy for 4 patients, religious 
(circumcision) for 1 patient and recurrent haemarthosis for 1 patient. 
In addition, 3 ‘other surgical procedures’ were performed in 3 patients and 2 were related to tooth 
extractions and one was a removal of a periumbilicial abscess.

Haemostatic response during and after surgery 
Haemostasis was successful in all the surgeries and no treatment failures were reported. The 
haemostatic response during surgery was rated excellent in 78% of the surgeries and the haemostatic 
response when haemostasis had been achieved was rated excellent in 67% of the cases. 
No wound haematomas were reported at any time for any of the patients undergoing surgery. 
Table 24: 
Haemostatic response by type of surgery – full analysis set 
Consumption of turoctocog alfa during and after surgery 
During the entire surgery period, the mean consumption of turoctocog alfa was 831 IU/kg per surgery 
ranging from 331 to 1468 IU/kg. From Day 1 to Day 7 of the surgery, the mean consumption was 432 
IU/kg per surgery and from Day 8 and until the patients returned to the preventive regimen, the mean 
consumption was 399 IU/kg per surgery.  
Blood loss during and after surgery 
The actual mean blood loss during surgery was 258 mL per surgery.  
Haemoglobin level before, during and after surgery 
The mean haemoglobin level before surgery was 9.53 mmol/L ranging from 8.32 to 10.35 mmol/L. The 
mean haemoglobin levels 1 hour and 24 hours after surgery were 9.4% and 16.2% lower, respectively.  
Blood product transfusion during and after surgery 
One blood product transfusion of 3 units of red blood cells was reported for one patient.

set 
Patient-reported Outcomes 
The EQ-5D had 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and 
anxiety/depression. For each domain, 3 answers were available. In the ‘mobility’ and ‘pain/discomfort’ 
domains, most of the patients reported some problems with mobility and moderate pain both at 
baseline and at the end of trial, probably as a consequence of their haemophilia. In the three other 
domains, most of the patients had no problems at baseline and at end of trial. 
In addition to the domains, EQ-5D has a VAS scale ranging from 0-100 intended for the patients to 
report their health state today. The mean change in the VAS scale from baseline to the end of trial was 
a modest improvement of 2.5 points. However, some patients had substantial changes in the VAS scale 
ranging from a worsening of 70 points to an improvement of 67 points. A total summary score for 
EQ-5D was calculated for each patient at baseline and at end of trial. The mean total summary score at 
baseline was 0.725 ranging from -0.181 to 1.000. The mean change from baseline to end of trial in the 
total summary score was modest (0.008). 
The patients who underwent surgery also completed the PRO questionnaires on the pre-surgery day 
and again on the day where they returned to their preventive treatment. The mean change on the 
Assessment report

EQ-5D VAS scale over this period was an improvement of 11.1 points ranging from a worsening of 2 
points to an improvement of 30 points. The mean change from the pre-surgery day to return on 
preventive treatment in the EQ-5D total summary score was modest (0.041). 
No noteworthy change was observed from baseline to end of trial in total HAEM-A-QOL score for adults.

Treatments 
The trial comprised eight scheduled visits. All patients attended a screening visit (Visit 1) in order to 
assess their eligibility. In the pharmacokinetic part of the trial, pharmacokinetic sessions were 
performed at Visit 2 and Visit 3. Preventive treatment with turoctocog alfa was administered to these 
patients from Visit 4 to Visit 8 (clinical part of trial). For patients in the clinical part of the trial, the 
preventive treatment started at Visit 2 and continued until Visit 8. Preventive treatment continued until 
each patient reached at least 50 exposure days with turoctocog alfa. 
If the patient/parents/LAR’s wished to continue treatment with turoctocog alfa the end-of-trial visit 
would also be the first visit in the extension trial NN7008-3568. 
Assessment report  
EMA/612026/2013 
Page 64/108 
 
  
  
Preventive treatment: 
During the clinical part of this trial the patients received bleeding preventive treatment with a single 
dose of turoctocog alfa of 25-50 IU/kg every second day or 25-60 IU/kg three times weekly. The trial 
product was preferably administered in the morning and was administered as a slow bolus i.v. injection 
(approximately 1-2 mL/min). 
The duration of treatment from first to last turoctocog alfa administration was approximately 18-22 
weeks corresponding to at least 50 exposure days. 
Treatment of bleeds: 
Dose level for treatment of bleeds was determined according to the following formula: Required units = 
body weight (bw) (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (IU/dL or % of normal) x 0.5 (IU/kg per IU/dL). The 
dose for treatment of bleeds was aimed to achieve an expected post-injection level of at least 0.50 
IU/mL of turoctocog alfa. Higher doses up to a total dose of 150 IU/kg per day could be used at the 
investigator’s discretion based on the site and severity of the bleed, and the clinical situation. When the 
bleed had resolved, the patient could resume the preventive regimen. 
Objectives 
The primary objective: to evaluate safety of turoctocog alfa in paediatric previously treated patients 
<12 years of age with haemophilia A. 
The secondary objectives: to evaluate pharmacokinetics of turoctocog alfa in paediatric previously 
treated patients <12 years of age with haemophilia A, to evaluate efficacy of turoctocog alfa in 
paediatric previously treated patients <12 years of age with haemophilia A and to assess and compare 
patient-reported outcomes from baseline to end of trial in paediatric previously treated patients <12 
years of age with haemophilia A.

Outcomes/endpoints 
The efficacy endpoints were as follows: 
•  Bleeding prevention 
o  Total consumption of turoctocog alfa per patient (prevention and treatment of bleeds) 
per month and annualized value. 
o  Actual consumption of turoctocog alfa (IU/kg /month) for bleeding prevention. 
o  Average number of bleeds per month. 
• 
Treatment of bleeds 
o  Haemostatic effect of turoctocog alfa on treatment of bleeds assessed on a predefined 
four point scale: none, moderate, good or excellent. 
o  Number of infusions of turoctocog alfa per bleed. 
o  Actual consumption of turoctocog alfa (IU/kg /bleed) for treatment of bleeds. 
Sample size 
No formal sample size calculations were performed. The sample size was based on the guideline 
EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009. 
Randomisation 
There was no randomisation of patients as the study was a single arm study. 
Blinding (masking) 
There was no blinding of patients as the study was an open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
There was no statistical analysis plan. 
Bleeding prevention:  
The annualised bleeding rate was estimated using a Poisson model allowing for overdispersion. For all 
patients, including withdrawn patients, the observed number of bleeds and observed time in the trial 
after the first dose of turoctocog alfa was used as input when estimating the annualised bleeding rate. 
Treatment of bleeds:  
Haemostatic effect of turoctocog alfa when used for treatment of acute bleeds was evaluated according 
to a predefined four-point scale (none, moderate, good or excellent) and presented using counts and 
percentages of bleeding episodes. If the haemostatic response was rated as excellent or good, the 
treatment of the bleed was counted as a success. If the haemostatic response was rated as moderate 
Assessment report

or none, the treatment was counted as a failure. As a conservative approach, the missing ratings were 
included as treatment failures. 
All other endpoints have been analysed in a descriptive manner.

Recruitment 
In this multi-centre trial, 26 study sites enrolled and dosed at least one patient. The country distribution 
was as follows (number of actively recruiting sites per country in parenthesis): Brazil (3), Italy (1), 
Lithuania (1), Macedonia (1), Malaysia (1), Poland (2), Russia (2), Serbia (1), Taiwan (1), Turkey (3) 
and the US (10). 
The trial was initiated in June 2010 (first patient first visit) and completed in November 2011 (last 
patient last visit). 
Conduct of the study 
During the conduct of the study there were 5 substantial amendments to the protocol. 
Baseline data 
The population was equally split between the two age cohorts (31 small children [0 - <6 years] and 32 
older children [6 - <12 years]) and consisted of males with severe haemophilia (FVIII activity ≤1%), 
with a median age of 6 years old (ranging from 1 to 11 years old) and a median weight of 21.0 kg 
(ranging from 11.7 to 56.0 kg). The majority of the patients were White (84%) and the second-largest 
group was Asian (10%). Nineteen percent (19%) of the patients were from the US, 14% were from 
Brazil, 13% were from Russia and 11% were from Turkey, while the remaining 42% of the patients 
were distributed between the other 7 countries. 
A total of 54 patients (24 small children and 35 older children) had information on their FVIII genotype; 
the most frequent mutations were inversions and substitutions. 
Numbers analysed 
A total of 69 patients were screened for this trial and 65 patients were enrolled. Of the 65 enrolled 
patients, 2 patients were withdrawn before dosing with turoctocog alfa (due to a historical positive 
inhibitor test and due to difficulties in attending the planned visits) and 3 patients were withdrawn after 
dosing (due to treatment with another FVIII product than turoctocog alfa, due to non-compliance with 
the trial procedures and for one patient it was decided that he should not continue in the trial); thus 60 
patients completed the trial. Of the 60 patients completing the trial, 29 were small children (0 - < 6 
years) and 31 were older children (6 - < 12 years). Of the 63 dosed patients, 28 (14 in each age cohort) 
were dosed in the pharmacokinetic part of the trial while the remaining 35 (17 small children and 18 
older children) were dosed in the clinical part of the trial. 
All 63 patients who were dosed with turoctocog alfa were included in the full analysis set (FAS) on which 
all the efficacy analyses, including analyses of patient-reported outcomes, are based. 
Outcomes and estimation 
A total of 126 bleeds were treated during the trial. A total of 22 patients (35%) did not experience any 
bleeds during the trial. The number of patients experiencing a specific number of bleeds during the trial 
is presented in the following table. 
Assessment report  
EMA/612026/2013 
Page 68/108 
 
  
  
Table 27: 
Frequency of bleeds - FAS 
The majority of the bleeds (67%) were caused by a trauma, 32% were spontaneous and for the 
remaining 1%, the cause was not reported in the diary. The proportion of bleeds caused by trauma was 
83% among the small children and 55% among the older children. The bleeds were classified as 
mild/moderate in 91% of the cases, as severe in 6% of the cases and for the remaining 3%, the 
classification was not reported in the diary. Joints were the most frequent locations of bleeds, 
accounting for 47% of which 22% were also in a target joint. The most frequently reported start time of 
a bleed was from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. and the least frequent was from 11 p.m. to 3 a.m. Two (2) of the 
126 bleeds were categorised as re-bleeds. Apart from the higher frequency of traumatic bleeds in small 
children compared to older children, there were no noteworthy differences between the two age groups. 
Consumption of turoctocog alfa 
Bleeding prevention 
The mean total consumption per month per patient for prevention and treatment of bleeds was 487 
IU/kg/patient ranging from 286 to 765 IU/kg/patient and slightly higher for patients in good compliance 
than for patients who were less compliant.  
The mean total consumption per year for prevention and treatment of bleeds was 5974.1 IU/kg/patient 
ranging from 3542 to 9532 IU/kg/patient.  
The mean total consumption for prevention, treatment of bleeds, minor surgery and pharmacokinetic 
sessions during the entire trial period was 2251 IU/kg/patient ranging from 830 to 5076 IU/kg/patient. 
There were no noteworthy differences between the small children and the older children.  
A total of 3610 preventive doses of turoctocog alfa were taken during the trial and the mean preventive 
dose was 36.8 IU/kg ranging from 3.2 to 73.9 IU/kg.  
The mean consumption per month for prevention was 462 IU/kg/month and for patients in good 
compliance it was 469 IU/kg/month, while for patients who were less compliant it was 426 
IU/kg/month.  
The same pattern was seen with the yearly consumption where the overall mean was 5641 IU/kg/year, 
5736 IU/kg/year for patients in good compliance and 5073 IU/kg/year for patients who were less 
compliant.  
There were no noteworthy differences between the small children and the older children. 
Assessment report  
EMA/612026/2013 
Page 69/108 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Treatment of bleeds 
A total of 187 doses were taken during the trial for treatment of 126 bleeds and the mean dose for 
treatment of a bleed (from start to stop of the bleed) was 40.4 IU/kg/dose ranging from 25.5 to 193.8 
IU/kg/dose. The mean consumption used for treatment of bleeds (from start to stop of the bleed) was 
54.2 IU/kg/bleed. The reason that the mean dose for treatment of a bleed was lower than the mean 
consumption from start to stop of a bleed was that some bleeds were treated with more than one dose. 
The mean consumption from the time the bleed stopped until the patient returned to preventive 
regimen was 8.0 IU/kg/bleed. The consumption of turoctocog alfa used for treatment of bleeds from 
start to stop of bleed was lower for patients in good compliance than for less compliant patients (48.9 
vs. 94.2 IU/kg/bleed).  
The mean dose for treatment of a bleed was slightly higher for small children than for older children 
(45.5 vs. 37.6 IU/kg/dose). Apart from this, there were no noteworthy differences between the small 
children and the older children.  
Estimated annualised bleeding rates 
The overall estimated annualised bleeding rate was 5.33 bleeds/patient/year (95% CI: 3.90-7.28 
bleeds/patient/year) and for young children (0-<6 years) it was 4.73 bleeds/patient/year (95% CI: 
3.06-7.30 bleeds/patient/year) while for older children (6 - <12 years) it was 5.86 bleeds/patient/year 
(95% CI: 3.76-9.13 bleeds/patient/year). 
Haemostatic response 
The haemostatic response was rated as excellent for 68 (54%) of the bleeds, good for 48 (38%) of the 
bleeds, moderate for 5 (4%) of the bleeds, and none for 2 (1.6%) of the bleeds. For the remaining 3 
(2.4%) bleeds, the haemostatic response was not rated.  
One of the bleeds where the haemostatic response was ‘none’ was a mild/moderate traumatic mucosal 
bleed. The duration of the bleed was 22 hours and required 2 infusions from start to stop of the bleed. 
The other bleed where the haemostatic response was ‘none’ was for patient number 866501 and is 
described in more detail in the following table.  
Table 28: 
Description of response in patient where haemostatic response was recorded 
as “none” 
Assessment report  
EMA/612026/2013 
Page 70/108 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
If the haemostatic response was rated as excellent or good, the treatment of the bleed was considered 
a success. If the haemostatic response was rated as moderate or none, the treatment was considered 
a failure. The success rate for treatment of bleeds was 94.3% (excluding bleeds for which there was no 
outcome reported). A more conservative approach (considering bleeds for which there was no reported 
outcome as treatment failures) gave a success rate of 92.1% for treatment of bleeds. It should be noted 
that only 1 or 2 infusions were reported for treatment of 2 of the 3 bleeds with missing haemostatic 
responses, while the last bleed with missing haemostatic response required 5 turoctocog alfa infusions. 
Furthermore, for 5 of the bleeds, the haemostatic response was rated as excellent even though more 
than 1 infusion was used to stop the bleed. There were no noteworthy differences in haemostatic 
response between the two age groups. 
Number of infusions of turoctocog alfa used for treatment of bleeds 
Of the 126 reported bleeds, 102 (81.0%) were stopped with 1 infusion of turoctocog alfa and 18 
(14.3%) were stopped with 2 infusions. Details on bleeds that required more than 2 infusions are 
presented in the following table. 
Table 29: 
Description of events where patients required more than 2 infusions to treat a 
bleed 
Some patients continued to take turoctocog alfa after they had reported the bleed as being stopped in 
order to maintain haemostasis. When looking at the number of infusions from the start of the bleed until 
the prevention was resumed, 1 infusion was required for 94 (74.6%) bleeds and 2 infusions were 
required for 17 (13.5%) bleeds. The mean number of infusions required from start to stop of a bleed 
was 1.3 infusions/bleed and the median number of infusions was 1 infusion/bleed. 
Time to control of a bleed 
The mean duration from start to stop of a bleed was 8.88 hours ranging from 0.17 to 53.5 hours. The 
mean time from start of a bleed and until the first administration of turoctocog alfa was 1.68 hours 
ranging from 0 to 16.8 hours and the mean time from the first administration of turoctocog alfa and 
Assessment report  
EMA/612026/2013 
Page 71/108 
 
  
  
 
 
until the bleed stopped was 7.5 hours ranging from 0 to 53.5 hours. The same pattern was observed 
when looking separately at the small children and older children. 
Ancillary analyses 
Efficacy of turoctocog alfa when used in surgery 
Two (2) minor surgeries in 2 patients were performed during the trial. One surgery in patient number 
705501 was a dental extraction and the other in patient number 865501 was described as ‘minor 
uncomplicated surgery’ covering removal of a central venous access port. Haemostasis was rated as 
excellent on both surgeries. The patient who had a dental extraction received a pre-surgery dose of 
turoctocog alfa of 50 IU/kg and after the surgery he had tranexamic acid 500 mg two times daily for 3 
days during the recovery period. The other patient had a presurgery dose of turoctocog alfa of 100 
IU/kg and a single dose of 50 IU/kg during the post-surgical recovery period. 
Patient-reported outcome 
Patient-reported outcomes were measured at Visit 1 and Visit 8 in order to investigate the change from 
baseline to the end-of-trial. The HAEMO-QOL questionnaire was available for two age groups (4-7 years 
and 8-12 years of age) in a patient version and in a parent version. The biggest change in the mean total 
summary score was seen in the parents’ versions for patients who were treated on-demand prior to trial 
entry (an improvement of 10.42 points for 4-7 year old patients and an improvement of 14.30 points for 
8-12 year old patients). Apart from this, no noteworthy changes were observed from baseline to end of 
trial in the total HAEMO-QOL scores.

The trial comprised a pharmacokinetic part and a clinical part. 
Patients not involved in the pharmacokinetic sessions could start directly on 
preventive treatment in the clinical part of the trial. Preventive treatment 
continued until each patient reached at least 50 exposure days with turoctocog 
alfa. An exposure day was defined as any day that the patient had been exposed 
to turoctocog alfa for prevention of bleeds, for treatment of bleeds and during 
the pharmacokinetic sessions.

bleeds/patient/year) while for older children (6 - <12 
years) it was 5.86 bleeds/patient/year (95% CI: 3.76-9.13 
bleeds/patient/year).

Haemostatic 
response 
The success rate for treatment of bleeds was 94.3% 
(excluding bleeds for which there was no outcome 
reported). A more conservative approach (considering 
bleeds for which there was no reported outcome as 
treatment failures) gave a success rate of 92.1% for 
treatment of bleeds. 
Number of 
infusions needed 
to stop a bleeding 
Of the 126 reported bleeds, 102 (81.0%) were stopped 
with 1 infusion of turoctocog alfa and 18 (14.3%) were 
stopped with 2 infusions. 
FVIII consumption  The mean preventive dose was 36.8 IU/kg ranging from 
3.2 to 73.9 IU/kg.  
The mean consumption per month for prevention was 462 
IU/kg/month and the mean yearly consumption was 5641 
IU/kg/year.  
The mean dose for treatment of a bleed (from start to stop 
of the bleed) was 40.4 IU/kg/dose ranging from 25.5 to 
193.8 IU/kg/dose. The mean consumption used for 
treatment of bleeds (from start to stop of the bleed) was 
54.2 IU/kg/bleed. 
Two (2) minor surgeries in 2 patients were performed 
during the trial. Haemostasis was rated as excellent on 
both surgeries.

Title: A multi-centre, open-label, non-controlled trial on safety and efficacy of turoctocog alfa 
in prevention and treatment of bleeds in previously treated patients with haemophilia A 
Sub-trial: Safety and efficacy of turoctocog alfa in prevention and treatment of bleeding 
during surgical procedures in patients with haemophilia A 
Study identifier 
Study NN7008-3543 
Design 
Part A: Included the patients who completed the pharmacokinetic trial (Trial 
3522). 
Part B: Included patients who had not previously participated in the 
pharmacokinetic trial (Trial 3522). Part B was initiated when 20 patients in part A 
had a safety assessment based upon results from Trial 3522. 
Surgery sub-trial: Included any of the patients from part A and part B that, during 
the course of the trial, needed to undergo a major or minor surgical procedure 
requiring at least 7 days of daily FVIII treatment, including the day of surgery. In 
the peri-operative period, turoctocog alfa should be administered as bolus 
infusions. 
Patients eligible for part A or part B of the trial received turoctocog alfa for 
prevention of bleeds for at least 75 preventive exposure days. Prevention and 
treatment of bleeds was carried out at home with intravenous (i.v.) injections by 
the patient or a support person. Details on home treatment were registered in a 
diary by the patient. 
Duration of main phase: 
Initiation date: 7 April 2009 (first patient first

Full Analysis Set 
Treatment group  Turoctocog alfa 
Number of subject  150 
Annualised 
bleeding rate 
The total estimated mean bleeding rate was 5.55 
bleeds/patient/year for adolescents and 6.68 
bleeds/patient/year for adults. The total median bleeding 
rate was 3.66 bleeds/patient/year. 
Haemostatic 
response 
The success rate for treatment of bleeds was 84.5% 
(excluding bleeds for which there was no outcome 
reported). A more conservative approach (considering 
bleeds for which there was no reported outcome as 
treatment failures) gave a success rate of 80.8% for 
treatment of bleeds. 
Number of 
infusions needed 
to stop a bleeding 
Of the 499 reported bleeds, 357 (71.5%) were stopped 
with 1 infusion of turoctocog alfa and 89 (17.8%) were 
stopped with 2 infusions. Thus, 89.4% of the bleeds were 
stopped with one or two infusions of turoctocog alfa. 
FVIII consumption  The mean preventive dose was 24.4 IU/kg ranging from 
12.8 to 97.4 U/kg. The mean consumption per month for 
prevention was 309 IU/kg/month. The mean yearly 
consumption for prevention was 3812 IU/kg/year. 
A total of 813 doses were taken during the trial for treatment 
of 499 bleeds and the mean dose for treatment of a bleed 
was 30.4 IU/kg/dose. The mean consumption used for 
treatment of bleeds (from start to stop of the bleed) was 
45.6 IU/kg/bleed.

Haemostatic 
response during 
surgery 
A total of 9 surgeries in 9 patients were performed during 
the trial. Eight of these were major surgeries and 1 was a 
minor surgery. Haemostasis was successful in all the 
surgeries and no treatment failures were reported. The 
haemostatic response during surgery was rated excellent 
in 78% of the surgeries.

treatment of bleeding episodes in patients with haemophilia A  
Sub-trial: Efficacy and safety of turoctocog alfa in prevention and treatment of bleeding 
during surgical procedures in patients with haemophilia A 
Interim analysis including data in the clinical database as of 21 November 2011 
Methods 
The trial was designed as an extension trial for patients completing one of the trials NN7008–3543, 
NN7008-3545, NN7008-3600 or NN7008-3893. The trial was an open-label, multi-centre, 
multi-national, single-arm trial investigating long-term safety and efficacy of turoctocog alfa in patients 
with severe haemophilia A without inhibitors. Furthermore, a sub-trial was designed to provide 
information on efficacy and safety of turoctocog alfa administered as either bolus or continuous infusion 
during surgery.

Treatments 
Subjects were treated either in the preventive regimen or in the on-demand regimen. Switching 
regimens (i.e. from preventive to on-demand or from on-demand to preventive) during the trial was 
permitted at an assessment visit, surgery visit, dispensing visit or unscheduled visit. 
Treatment in the different regimens and during surgery is summarised in the following table. 
Objectives 
The primary objective: to assess the safety of turoctocog alfa for prevention and treatment of bleeds. 
The secondary objective: to assess the efficacy of turoctocog alfa for prevention and treatment of 
bleeds. 
Objectives for the sub-trial in surgery 
The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of turoctocog alfa in surgery. 
The secondary objectives were to evaluate the safety of turoctocog alfa in surgery and, with 
amendment 1 this objective was added, to evaluate the haemostatic response to turoctocog alfa in the 
post-surgery period. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The efficacy endpoints were as follows: 
During preventive regimen 
•  Annualised bleeding rate related to the preventive period 
•  Haemostatic response to turoctocog alfa (none, moderate, good or excellent) in treatment of 
bleeds

Surgery sub-trial 
•  Haemostatic effect of turoctocog alfa assessed by evaluation according to a predefined four 
point scale: None, moderate, good or excellent 
•  Assessment of the actual consumption of turoctocog alfa (IU/kg) in the time period Day 1 to 
Day 7 and in the time period Day 8 to return to pre-surgery regimen 
•  Comparison of actual and anticipated blood loss 
•  Haemoglobin level prior to surgery, during, and after surgery (pre-operative, intra-operative 
and post-operative)

Sample size 
The sample size was based on the number of patients who completed Trials NN7008-3543, 
NN7008-3545, NN7008-3600 and NN7008-3893. 
Randomisation 
The patients were not randomised as this is a single arm trial. 
Blinding (masking) 
The patients were not blinded as this is an open label trial. 
Statistical methods 
Efficacy Endpoints 
Bleeding prevention: Annualised bleeding rates were estimated using a Poisson model allowing for 
overdisperson and presented together with 95% confidence intervals. 
In the protocol a secondary efficacy endpoint was specified specifically for the prevention period. 
According to the protocol the endpoint was to be ‘Average number of bleeds per month reported during 
the prevention period’. The prevention period was specified as related to ‘subject on preventive 
regimen’. However, as all subjects start in this trial on the preventive regimen, and as some subjects 
will switch to on-demand regimen, the text in the SAP has been changed to focus on ‘time on preventive 
regimen’ rather than ‘subjects on preventive regimen’. 
Treatment of bleeds: The haemostatic response to turoctocog alfa was evaluated according to a 
predefined four point scale: None, moderate, good or excellent, will be presented using counts and 
percentages of all treatment requiring bleeds. The haemostatic response was also evaluated according 
to the categories: success (good or excellent) and failure (none or moderate).  
Data arising from other endpoints defined were analysed using standard descriptive measures.

Recruitment 
In this multi-centre, multi-national trial the patients were enrolled at 51 sites in 18 countries: Brazil (4 
sites), Croatia (2 sites), Germany (3 sites), Israel (1 site), Italy (2 sites), Japan (5 sites), Lithuania (1 
site), Macedonia (1 site), Malaysia (1 site), Poland (2 sites), Russian Federation (2 sites), Republic of 
Serbia (5 sites), Spain (2 sites), Switzerland (1 site), Taiwan (1 site), Turkey (5 sites), the UK (1 site) 
and the US (12 sites). 
The trial was initiated in October 2009 and is still ongoing. The submitted study report describes interim 
data as of the cut-off date of 21 November 2011. 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
Up until the cut-off date, there were 11 substantial amendments to the protocol. 
A patient withdrew before dosing (reason for withdrawal: subject´s decision). For another patient no 
diary (and thus no dosing information) was available at the cut-off date (21 November 2011).  
As of the cut-off date (21 November 2011), 8 patients had been withdrawn from the trial after dosing 
with turoctocog alfa. Patient one met withdrawal criterion 12 ‘Use of coagulation factors other than 
turoctocog alfa’ and withdrawal criterion 13 ‘Use of commercial FVIII products’ and was therefore 
withdrawn. Patient two was withdrawn due to an adverse event of psychotic disorder. Patient three 
received one dose of turoctocog alfa in the present trial and was thus included in the FAS. However, 
after this dose, the patient dropped out due to an adverse event at the end of his previous trial 
(NN7008-3543). The reason for withdrawal was listed as ‘other’. Patient four withdrew due to 
non-planned surgery, which logistically could not be handled within the present trial and patient five 
was withdrawn due to non-compliance with the protocol. The remaining 3 patients were withdrawn due 
to withdrawal of consent  or on his own initiative.

Baseline data 
The population consisted of male patients with severe haemophilia (FVIII activity ≤1%) and was 
divided in 4 age groups: small children (0 - <6 years), older children (6 - <12 years), adolescents (12 
- <18 years) and adults (≥18 years). The age is defined as the age when the patient entered the first 
turoctocog alfa trial.  
Prior to the trial, the mean number of turoctocog alfa infusions per patient was 81 infusions. The 
majority of patients were White (83%) and the second-largest group was Asian (11%). The three 
largest nationalities were US (17%), Serbia (13%) and Brazil (12%), while the remaining 58% of the 
patients were distributed among the other 15 countries. 
Numbers analysed 
A total of 189 patients were included and 187 patients were dosed with turoctocog alfa in the present 
trial.  
Outcomes and estimation 
At the cut-off date (21 November 2011), a total of 366 bleeds were reported in 86 of the 187 
participating patients. It should be noted that 30 patients (16%) had not available diary data as of the 
cut-off date (21 November 2011), since they had not yet attended Visit 2 at which the first diary data 
were collected.  
The majority of the bleeds (66%) were spontaneous and 34% were caused by trauma; however for the 
older children, 13% were spontaneous and 87% were caused by trauma. The bleeds were classified as 
mild/moderate in 86% of the cases and as severe in 14% of the cases. The most frequent location of the 
bleeds was in a joint, which accounted for 78% of the bleeds and 48% of the total number of the bleeds 
were in a target joint. The two most frequently reported start times of a bleed was from 7 a.m. to 11 
a.m. and from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. The least frequently reported start time was from 11 p.m. to 3 a.m. 
Estimated annualized bleeding rates during preventive treatment 
The overall estimated annualised bleeding rate was low (3.54 bleeds/patient/year; 95% CI: 2.90- 4.33 
bleeds/patient/year) ranging from 2.61 bleeds/patient/year in adolescents to 3.71 bleeds/patient/year 
in adults. The estimated annualised bleeding rate for traumatic bleeds was lower than for spontaneous 
bleeds (1.21 vs. 2.33 bleeds/patient/year).  
The estimated annualised bleeding rate for all patients varied considerably among the countries with 
the lowest rate in Spain (0.42 bleeds/patient/year) and the highest in the Russian Federation (9.42 
bleeds/patient/year). Excluding bleeds and corresponding exposure periods that occurred more than 72 
hours after the last preventive dose resulted in a decrease in the total estimated annualised bleeding 
rate from 3.54 to 3.10 bleeds/patient/year. Excluding bleeds and corresponding exposure periods that 
occurred more than 48 hours after the last preventive dose resulted in a decrease in the total estimated 
annualised bleeding rate from 3.54 to 2.53 bleeds/patient/year.  
The mean dose used for prevention was 30.4 IU/kg ranging from 4.3 to 86.0 IU/kg.  
The mean consumption per patient per year was 4898 IU/kg/patient ranging from 2041 to 9945 
IU/kg/patient. 
The mean consumption from start to stop of a bleed was 53.2 IU/kg/bleed ranging from 19.9 to 735.3 
IU/kg/bleed.

Haemostatic response 
The haemostatic response was rated as excellent for 170 (46%) of the bleeds, good for 149 (41%) of 
the bleeds, moderate for 44 (12%) of the bleeds, and none for 3 (1%) of the bleeds. 
The 3 bleeds where the haemostatic response was rated as ‘none’ were: 
•  A mild/moderate traumatic muscular bleed, which required 4 infusions from start to stop of the 
bleed. The duration of the bleed was 139 hours. 
•  A severe spontaneous joint bleed, which required 3 infusions from start to stop of the bleed. The 
duration of the bleed was 47 hours. 
•  A severe spontaneous joint bleed, which required 5 infusions from start to stop of the bleed. The 
duration of the bleed was 43 hours. 
If the haemostatic response was rated as excellent or good, the treatment of the bleed was considered 
a success. If the haemostatic response was rated as moderate or none, the treatment was considered 
a failure. The overall success rate for treatment of bleeds was 87.2% ranging from 73.9% in older 
children to 93.8% in adolescents. It should be noted that for 11 of the bleeds, the haemostatic response 
was rated as excellent even though more than 1 infusion was used to stop the bleed. 
Number of infusions of turoctocog alfa used for treatment of bleeds 
Of the 366 reported bleeds, 288 (78.7%) were stopped with 1 infusion of turoctocog alfa, 44 (12.0%) 
were stopped with 2 infusions and 15 (4.1%) were stopped with 3 infusions. 
Details on the remaining bleeds that required more than 3 infusions are presented in the following table.

Time to control of a bleed 
The median duration from start to stop of a bleed was 13.6 hours ranging from 0.17 to 273.3 hours. The 
median time from start of a bleed and until the first administration of turoctocog alfa was 1.0 hour 
ranging from 0 to 67.2 hours and the median time from the first administration of turoctocog alfa and 
until the bleed stopped was 10.0 hours ranging from 0.08 to 270 hours. 
Efficacy of turoctocog alfa when used in surgery 
Two major surgeries were performed up until the cut-off date (21 November 2011). The surgery 
indications were pain in left ankle  and poly-trauma. Both patients received turoctocog alfa as bolus 
administrations during surgery. 
Patient with pain in left ankle 
This patient was hospitalised for 7 days counting from the day of surgery and the duration of the actual 
surgery was 40 minutes. The consumption of turoctocog alfa during the 7 days was 192 IU/kg. No blood 
product transfusions, no blood loss and no wound haematoma were reported. The haemostatic 
response both during and after surgery was rated as excellent. The difference in haemoglobin level from 
pre-surgery to 1 hour post-surgery was -13.7% and from pre-surgery to 24 hours post-surgery it was 
-3.6%. 
Patientwith poly-trauma 
This surgery was linked to a serious adverse event (fall) which involved femur fracture and hand 
fracture. In the description of the surgery in the eCRF, the investigator had reported a ‘left hip 
arthroprothesis and finger fracture reduction’. The patient was hospitalised for 7 days counting from the 
day of surgery and the duration of the actual surgery was 3 hours and 25 minutes. The consumption of 
turoctocog alfa during the 7 days was 278 IU/kg. The actual blood loss during the procedure was 500 
mL and 2 units (538 mL) of red blood cells were transfused. No wound haematoma was reported. The 
haemostatic response during surgery was rated as good and the haemostatic response after surgery 
was rated as excellent. The difference in haemoglobin level from pre-surgery to 1 hour post-surgery 
was -30.9% and from pre-surgery to 24 hours post-surgery it was -16.1%. 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses) 
Trial population 
As of the cut-off date (21 November 2011), a total of 214 patients with haemophilia A had been exposed 
to turoctocog alfa in the clinical development programme. One (1) patient did not continue from the 
pharmacokinetic first human dose trial (Trial 3522) into the pivotal trial (Trial 3543) and does not 
contribute with clinical efficacy data. As of the cut-off date (21 November 2011), 11 patients had 
received turoctocog alfa during surgery (10 major surgeries and 1 minor surgery). Distribution of the 
flow of patients is shown in Figure 6.

Figure 6: 
Distribution of flow of patients in the clinical programme of turoctocog alfa 
The trial populations were selected to represent previously treated patients with severe haemophilia A 
(FVIII activity ≤ 1%) without inhibitors. The trials were global and included patients from Brazil, 
Croatia, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, Lithuania, Macedonia, Malaysia, Poland, the Russian Federation, 
Republic of Serbia, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey, the UK and the US. The majority of the patients 
(82%) were White and of non-Hispanic/non-Latino ethnicity (80%). 
A total of 66% of the patients had been on a prophylactic regimen, and 55% had been on an on-demand 
regimen prior to entering the turoctocog alfa programme (some patients had been on both regimens, 
explaining that the numbers do not sum up to 100%). Half of the patients on prophylaxis used 
recombinant FVIII products, while one-fourth of the patients on an on-demand treatment regimen used 
recombinant FVIII products. 
Except for one adult patient, all patients with available data were hepatitis B negative. Among patients 
with available data on hepatitis C and HIV, all patients below 18 years of age were hepatitis C and HIV 
negative, whereas 58% of the adult patients were hepatitis C positive and 10% were HIV positive.

Annualised bleeding rate 
A total of 991 bleeds were reported in 158 of the 213 patients. Traumatic bleeds were more frequent in 
children whereas spontaneous bleeds were more frequent in adolescents and adults. The majority of 
the bleeds were joint bleeds (72%).  
The estimated annualised bleeding rate, when pooling data from Trials 3543, 3545 and 3568, was 4.89 
bleeds/patient/year. However, the rates varied between the pivotal trials (6.50 bleeds/patient/ year in 
Trial 3543 and 5.33 bleeds/patient/year in Trial 3545) and the extension trial (3.54 bleeds/patient/year 
in Trial 3568). No association between age and annualised bleeding rate was apparent. 
The estimated annualised bleeding rate varied considerably by country, with the lowest rate in Poland 
(1.18 bleeds/patient/year) and the highest rate in the Russian Federation (11.88 bleeds/patient/ year). 
No association between previous treatment regimen (on-demand, prophylaxis or both) and estimated 
annualised bleeding rate was observed that could explain the variation between the countries. 
As of the cut-off date (21 November 2011), 68 patients had been on preventive treatment with 
turoctocog alfa for at least 12 months. The estimated annualised bleeding rate for these patients (4.29 
bleeds/patient/year; 95% CI: 3.28−5.60 bleeds/patient/year) was comparable to the estimated 
annualised bleeding rate for the total trial population (4.89 bleeds/patient/year; 95% CI: 4.16−5.74 
Assessment report  
EMA/612026/2013

bleeds/patient/year), indicating that potential seasonal variation does not influence the overall 
estimate. 
Bleeding rates by time since the latest preventive dose 
Analyses of the estimated annualised bleeding rate within 24 hours, 24−48 hours and 48−72 hours 
after a prophylactic dose showed that the bleeding rate increased with time since the latest prophylactic 
dose. This further supports the finding of a strong prophylactic effect of turoctocog alfa treatment and 
indicates that a standard prophylactic regimen of treatment (every second day or three times weekly) 
is superior to a less frequent dosing regimen.

Haemostatic effect 
As a conservative approach, bleeds without reported outcomes were considered as treatment failures 
resulting in a success rate of 84.6% when pooling all trials. Excluding bleeds for which there were no 
reported outcomes (N=25) resulted in a success rate of 86.8%. A total of 898 (90.6%) of the bleeds 
were resolved with 1−2 infusions of turoctocog alfa, indicating that the clinical efficacy of turoctocog 
alfa in treatment of bleeds is similar to other rFVIII products. 
Table 33: 
Haemostatic effect in treatment of bleeds − Trials NN7008-3543, 
NN7008-3545 and NN7008-3568 – Full analysis set 
Haemostatic effect by country 
Following countries had a success rate below 80%: Brazil (79.5%), Israel (74.8%), Japan (66.7%), 
Taiwan (72.7%) and United Kingdom (77.8%). Apart from Israel (total patient n =159) the number of 
patients and number of bleeds in these countries were low. 
Haemostatic effect by location of the bleed 
The success rate was also investigated by the following locations: Joint, target joint, subcutaneous, 
muscular, gastrointestinal, mucosal and other. The success rates for the pooled trials (when bleeds 
without reported outcomes were considered as treatment failures) were 84.4% for joint bleeds, 85.0% 
for target joint bleeds (defined as 3 or more bleeds in the same joint within 6 months), 87.8% for 
subcutaneous bleeds, 85.7% for muscular bleeds, 86.2% for bleeds where the location of the bleed was 
reported as “other” and 80% for bleeds where the location of the bleed was not reported. Few 
gastrointestinal and mucosal bleeds (5 and 10 bleeds, respectively) were reported and the 
corresponding success rates were 60% and 90%. 
Haemostatic effect by cause of bleed 
The success rate (rated as “excellent” or “good”) was similar for spontaneous bleeds (84.3%) and 
traumatic bleeds (85.8%) for the pooled trials. 
Haemostatic effect by time on turoctocog alfa 
A plot of the success rate by number of months that the patients had been on turoctocog alfa treatment 
showed that there was no consistent increase or decrease of the haemostatic effect over time (Figure 
9).

Haemostatic effect by time from onset of a bleed to treatment of the bleed 
The success rate was investigated by the time elapsed from the onset of the bleed and until the 
treatment with turoctocog alfa was initiated and a decrease in the success rate with increased time from 
onset of the bleed until treatment can be seen (Figure 10).

Efficacy in surgery 
A total of 11 surgeries were performed in 11 patients, of which 10 were major surgeries and 1 was 
minor. Except for 1 adolescent patient, all patients undergoing surgery were adults. The surgery 
indications included arthropathy and chronic pain in the left knee for 1 patient, synovitis for 1 patient, 
semi-impacted tooth and removal of tooth root for 1 patient, arthropathy for 4 patients, circumcision for 
1 patient, recurrent haemarthrosis for 1 patient, pain in left ankle for 1 patient and poly-trauma for 1 
patient. Haemostasis was successful (haemostatic effect was rated as excellent or good) in all the 
surgeries, indicating that turoctocog alfa has a significant haemostatic effect both during and after 
surgery. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The three main trials were designed as open label, single arm studies evaluating the efficacy and safety 
of turoctocog alfa.  Originally, the primary objective of the studies was efficacy and evaluating 
prevention of bleeds as well as treatment of bleeds. This changed to safety with Amendment 14 (dated 
15-Oct-2009) and all efficacy parameters were proposed as secondary endpoints, whereas 
Assessment report  
EMA/612026/2013 
Page 90/108 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
immunogenicity was chosen as primary endpoint. According to the scientific advice letters 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/14717/2010, EMA/CHMP/SAWP/287098/2010, EMA/423638/2010), the CHMP did 
not agree with this proposal. Therefore, clinical efficacy data submitted was considered as the primary 
endpoint when assessing the results of the trial. In general, the studies were conducted in accordance 
with the guideline on the clinical investigation of recombinant and human plasma-derived factor VIII 
products (EMEA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009).  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
When pooling data from all submitted trials investigating efficacy of turoctocog alfa (NN7008-3543, 
NN7008-3545 and NN7008-3568) the estimated annualised bleeding rate was 4.89 
bleeds/patient/year. Due to the large variation in the annualised bleeding rate between patient, the 
median rates were also taken into account as relevant. The total median bleeding rate was 3.66 
bleeds/patient/year which was considerably lower than the mean bleeding rate. The success rate 
(defined as haemostatic effect rated as good or excellent) was 84.6% across all trials and most of the 
bleeds (90.6%) were resolved with 1-2 infusions. Efficacy data for on-demand treatment were not 
available.  
The preventive dose regimens chosen for adolescents and adults in Trial NN7008-3543 were 20-40 
IU/kg every second day or 20-50 IU/kg three times per week. The preventive dose regimens chosen for 
paediatric patients in Trial NN7008-3545 were 25-50 IU/kg every second day or 25-60 IU/kg three 
times per week. In the extension trial the dose regimen for prevention also differed slightly: 20−50 
IU/kg every second day or 20−60 IU/kg 3 times weekly. These differences are reflected by the 
consumption data. The mean dose used for prevention showed that the administered dosage in the 
paediatric trial NN7008-3545 (36.8 IU/kg) was significantly higher than in the pivotal trial 
NN7008-3543 (24.4 IU/kg). Further, the mean preventive dose was also increased in the extension 
study NN7008-3548 (30.4 IU/kg). A similar relation is observed for the mean consumption per patient 
per year during prevention and the mean consumption from start to stop of a bleed. In general, the 
estimated annualised bleeding rates of the main trials were regarded to be in an acceptable range. The 
observed annualised bleeding rates from the pivotal study in adults and the paediatric study were 
higher than in the extension study. An increase of the preventive dose for the adult and the paediatric 
participants entering the extension trial might be the reason for the different annualised bleeding rates. 
The mean difference appears low. The majority of patients in the turoctocog alfa clinical trials were on 
the three times weekly regimen, which reflects the clinical practice. When pooling all trial data, no 
difference was observed in the annualised bleeding rate for patients on every second day regimen 
compared to the three times weekly regimen (includes one period >48 hours). Both regimens were 
considered appropriate. 
The general details of the bleeds are regarded comparable for the full analysis set and the individual 
studies. Overall, the success rates of the treatment of bleeds using turoctocog alfa are in an acceptable 
range. In the pivotal trial NN7008-3543 the haemostatic response was rated as none in 12 bleeding 
episodes in 6 patients. One patient, who experienced five bleedings with no response was not very 
compliant.  The bleedings with a haemostatic response rated as ‘none’ were all treated with only 1-2 
infusions with the exception of one. This last case could partially be explained by the misinterpretation 
of musculoskeletal pain as a bleed. The haemostatic response and success rate was also investigated by 
a number of other factors. The success rate for mucosal bleeds and bleeds with the location reported as 
“other” was lower. Apart from Israel, there were no noteworthy differences in success rates among 
countries. The haemostatic response by time from onset of bleed to the first trial drug administration for 
Assessment report  
EMA/612026/2013 
Page 91/108 
 
  
  
treatment of the bleed did not show apparent differences between patients. The calculated mean time 
to control a bleed is in an acceptable range. 90.6% of the bleeds were resolved with 1-2 infusions of 
turoctocog alfa, which is regarded as a good and sufficient response. The number of infusions required 
to stop a bleeding does not fully correspond to the rating of the haemostatic response e.g. rating 
excellent and the requirement of 2 or more infusions. However, these small inconsistencies are usually 
observed in such kind of studies. The mean haemoglobin levels 1 hour and 24 hours after surgery were 
9.4% and 16.2% lower, respectively. These values might however be influenced by changes in the total 
fluid balance of the body. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Efficacy of turoctocog alfa is supported by the data on consumption, annualized bleeding rates and 
haemostatic response and success rates. The results presented for the individual trials as well as for 
the pooled data are considered robust and support the assumption of effective prophylaxis as well as 
treatment of breakthrough bleeds and protection during surgery. Efficacy data for on-demand 
treatment were not available. The CHMP recommends to include at least 10 PTPs receiving on-demand 
treatment in the extension trial and evaluate the bleeding pattern and the consumption data for a 
minimum of 6 months. The results can be provided post-marketing.  
The safety and efficacy of NovoEight in previously untreated patients have not yet been established. 
No data are available. This is reflected in the RMP as missing information. 
Based on the clinical trial data, the proposed dosing range for turoctocog alfa is supported and thus no 
dose adjustment is required. Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a doctor 
experienced in the treatment of haemophilia. No difference was observed in the annualised bleeding 
rate for patients on every second day regimen compared to the three times weekly regimen (includes 
one period >48 hours). Therefore, both dosing regimens are considered appropriate. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Overall 214 patients had a total of 32,929 exposure days during prevention and for treatment of bleeds 
to turoctocog alfa in all the applicant-sponsored clinical trials up to 21 November 2011 as the cut-off 
date for ongoing trials.

The pharmacokinetic measurements were based on a single dose of turoctocog alfa. However, patients 
participating in these two trials received preventive treatment with turoctocog alfa during the period between the 
screening visit and the pharmacokinetic session. In addition to the preventive doses, three bleeds were treated 
with turoctocog alfa in Trial 3600 and two bleeds were treated with turoctocog alfa in Trial 3893. 
Adverse events 
A total of 503 adverse events were reported in 154 patients during prevention and treatment of bleeds. 
The overall rate was 2.45 adverse events per patient year of exposure. 
Table 34: 
Overview of adverse events reported during prevention and treatment of 
bleeds: Trials 3522, 3893, 3600, 3543, 3545 and 3568 pooled – Safety 
analysis set 
The most commonly reported adverse events were related to dosing (incorrect dose administered [0.13 
events per patient year of exposure], wrong technique in drug usage process [0.01 event per patient 
year of exposure], overdose [0.01 event per patient year of exposure], underdose [0.01 event per 
patient year of exposure] and injection site extravasation [1 event]), headache (0.17 events per patient 
year of exposure) and nasopharyngitis (0.15 events per patient year of exposure). The overall rate of 
adverse events decreased over months on turoctocog alfa treatment. No differences in the safety profile 
of turoctocog alfa have been observed between children and adults. The overall rate of adverse events 
was, however, slightly higher for the young children (0≤6 years) (3.53 events per patient year of 
exposure) as compared to the other age groups. Events reported more frequently in young children as 
compared to the other age groups included upper respiratory tract infection, pyrexia, vomiting, cough 
and ear pain. Two events in one child (contusion and incorrect dose administered) were evaluated as 
possibly or probably related to trial product by the investigator. 
A total of 26 adverse events in 17 patients were evaluated by the investigator as possibly or probably 
related to trial product. These events occurred in Trials NN7008-3522, NN7008-3543, NN7008-3545 
and NN7008-3568. The most frequently reported events evaluated by the investigator as possibly or 
probably related to trial product were injection site erythema, pyrexia and increased hepatic enzymes. 
During the review, it was observed that 18 adverse events of increased hepatic parameters (defined as 
alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin conjugated, blood alkaline

phosphatase, total bilirubin, hyperbilirubinaemia, gamma-glutamyltransferase and “hepatic enzymes 
increased”) were recorded for 10 patients. The majority (8/10=80%) of these patients were positive for 
hepatitis C. Most of these events (14/18=78%) were evaluated by the investigator as unlikely related 
to trial product. Four (4) events of increased levels of hepatic enzymes in 3 patients  were recorded by 
the investigator as probably or possibly related to trial product.

Summary of adverse events possibly o probably related to trial product: Trials 
3522, 3893, 3600, 3543, 3545 and 3568 pooled − Safety analysis set 
A total of 13 events in 11 patients were rated as severe (melaena, upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage, 
road traffic accident, suicide attempt, depression, arthropathy, blood glucose increased, glucose urine 
present, sinusitis, femur fracture, peripheral artery aneurysm, fall, muscle haemorrhage, intestinal 
haemorrhage and tympanic membrane perforation). These events were all evaluated as unlikely related 
to trial product by the investigator.

Adverse events during surgery 
As the cut-off date (21 November 2011), a total of 11 patients (1 adolescent and 10 adult patients) 
were included in the surgery sub-trials (Trials NN7008-3543, NN7008-3568). These patients had a total 
of 210 exposure days to turoctocog alfa (mean: 18.3 exposure days per patient). 
A total of 5 adverse events were recorded in 5 patients during surgery. All events were evaluated by the 
investigator as unlikely related to trial product.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
As of the 1 May 2012 one death had occurred during the trials. This event concerned a 27-year-old 
patient in Trial NN7008-3568. This patient was brought to the hospital in a state of unconsciousness 
(Glasgow coma scale 7) and was bleeding from the right scalp/temporal area. The cause of the trauma 
was alleged to be an assault and a cranial computerised tomography (CT) scan revealed a right-sided 
fronto-temporal parietal subdural haemorrhage with midline shift, mixed density and cerebral edema. 
The patient underwent an emergency (right) decompressive craniotomy with evacuation of the 
haematoma. The patient was covered with trial medication preoperatively and continued 
post-operatively till he was declared dead 2 days after arrival at the hospital.  
No other fatal events occurred during the trials. 
Other serious adverse events 
A total of 21 serious adverse events were recorded in 17 patients in Trials NN7008-3543, NN7008-3545 
and NN7008-3568 corresponding to a rate of 0.10 serious adverse events per patient year of exposure. 
The serious adverse events occurred after 11 to 368 turoctocog alfa exposure days and no association 
between frequency of the events and exposure time was observed (Table 37). No serious adverse 
events were recorded in the pharmacokinetic Phase 1 trials.

Listing of serious adverse events reported during prevention and treatment of 
bleeds: Trials 3522, 3893, 3600, 3543, 3545 and 3568 – Safety analysis set 
A total of 4 serious adverse events in 4 patients were reported in Trial NN7008-3568 between the 
individual cut-off dates (last visit before 21 November 2011) and 1 May 2012. The serious adverse 
events were subdural haemorrhage, cellulitis/staphylococcal infection, pancreatitis and cholelithiasis. 
The outcome of one of the serious adverse events (subdural haemorrhage) was fatal (see deaths). All 
four events were regarded as unlikely related to turoctocog alfa administration.  
No thromboembolic events or allergic type hypersensitivity reactions against turoctocog alfa occurred 
during all trials.

Laboratory findings 
Overall, no clinically relevant changes associated with exposure to trial product have been observed for 
parameters of haematology, biochemistry and urinalysis in any of the clinical trials with turoctocog alfa. 
Haematology 
Haematology was assessed in all trials. In NN7008-3522, one patient experienced 3 adverse events of 
decrease in red blood cell count, haemoglobin and haematocrit. These events were observed 49 hours 
after administration of turoctocog alfa. All events were reported as unlikely related to trial product by 
the investigator and the patient recovered from all events. Furthermore, several patients had low 
haemoglobin levels at baseline and/or during the trial.  
An adverse event of increased neutrophil count was reported for one patient in NN7008-3545. In 
addition, an adverse event of increased white blood cell count was recorded for one patient in 
NN7008-3568. Both patients recovered from these events. 
Biochemistry 
Biochemistry was assessed in all trials. A total of 18 adverse events of increased hepatic parameters 
were reported during NN7008-3543 and NN7008-3568 in 10 patients, reflecting a relatively high 
proportion of patients (58% of the adult patients) with positive hepatitis C antibody tests. In 
NN7008-3893, one patient experienced increased levels of blood glucose. This was reported as an 
adverse event. 
Urinalysis 
Urinalysis was performed in trials NN7008-3522, NN7008-3600 and NN7008-3543. A few abnormal 
findings were observed in trial 3600 (blood and bilirubin in urine of one patient). None of these findings 
were considered clinically significant by the investigator. No clinically relevant changes over the trial 
period were apparent in trials NN7008-3522 and NN7008-3543. 
Safety in special populations 
Intrinsic factors 
No differences in the safety profile of turoctocog alfa have been observed between children and adults. 
No inhibitors were observed in any of the patients. As all patients were males with severe haemophilia 
A, no analyses of safety by sex or severity of disease could be performed.  
Use in pregnancy and lactation 
Based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of turoctocog 
alfa during pregnancy has not been evaluated in clinical trials.  
Immunological events 
FVIII inhibitors 
The immunogenicity of turoctocog alfa was assessed throughout the development programme, and 
tests for FVIII inhibitors were performed in all clinical trials. All cases of inhibitors were to be recorded 
as adverse events. As of the 1 May 2012, no patients developed FVIII inhibitors. Furthermore, no signs 
of early inhibitor development were observed as evaluated by FVIII activity (incremental recovery), and 
the pharmacokinetic results of 15 patients in trial NN7008-3543 (3−6 month after first injection of 
Assessment report  
EMA/612026/2013 
Page 97/108 
 
  
  
turoctocog alfa) were comparable to the results obtained after the first dose of turoctocog alfa in trial 
NN7008-3522. 
In trial NN7008-3545, one patient had a positive FVIII inhibitor test at visit 4, however, the results of a 
second separately drawn sample was negative, meaning that the definition of FVIII inhibitors was not 
met. The positive FVIII inhibitor test at visit 4 was reported as an adverse event and as a medical event 
of special interest. The patient was withdrawn from the trial due to treatment with a FVIII concentrate 
other than turoctocog alfa (trial withdrawal criteria). A further blood sample was tested and found to be 
negative, when the patient had his final visit (visit 8) following the decision to withdraw him from the 
trial. 
Other antibodies 
Assessments for development of anti-host cell protein antibodies (anti-CHO antibodies and anti-murine 
IgG antibodies) were performed at regular time points during trials NN7008-3522, NN7008-3543 and 
NN7008-3545. A total of 19 patients were at some point during the trials positive for anti-CHO 
antibodies. Of these, 2 patients changed from anti-CHO negative to anti-CHO positive and 6 patients 
changed from anti-CHO positive to anti-CHO negative. The remaining 11 patients were either positive 
throughout the trials (N=6), negative at baseline and end-of trial but with transient positive samples 
(N=2) or positive at baseline and end-of trial but with negative samples in between (N=3). No patients 
changed from anti-murine IgG negative to positive during the trials. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No interaction studies were submitted. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Two patients (0.9%) were withdrawn due to adverse events.  
One patient was withdrawn due to an adverse event of fatigue lasting for about 24 hours after every 
infusion of turoctocog alfa. The event was evaluated as mild and possibly related to trial product. 
The other patient was withdrawn after 368 exposure days due to a chronic psychotic disorder which was 
evaluated as moderate and unlikely related to the trial product.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The design of the clinical trials that contribute to the safety database is according to guideline 
requirements. Non-controlled studies are acceptable in the small haemophilia A population in order to 
gain sufficient exposure with the new coagulation factor and to not spend some of the rare patients on 
an already established FVIII product. Adult and paediatric patients have been sufficiently exposed to 
turoctocog alfa. 
During all clinical studies a total of 30 adverse reactions were reported in 19 of 214 patients exposed 
into turoctocog alfa. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were injection site reactions and 
Assessment report  
EMA/612026/2013 
Page 98/108 
 
  
  
hepatic enzymes increased. Of the 30 adverse reactions, 2 were reported in 1 out of 31 patients below 
6 years of age, none in patients from 6 to 18 years of age and 28 were reported in 16 out of 127 adults. 
The observed adverse event profile is considered similar to that of other licensed FVIII products and 
did not give rise to concern. The following adverse events were designated as medical events of special 
interest (MESIs) in all trials: medication errors; suspected transmission of an infectious agent via a 
trial product; thromboembolic events; formation of FVIII inhibitors; allergic type hypersensitivity 
reactions, including anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions. 
The summary of safety profile includes: hypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include 
angioedema, burning and stinging at the infusion site, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, 
hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, restlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, 
vomiting, wheezing) have been observed rarely and may in some cases progress to severe anaphylaxis 
(including shock). 
In clinical studies involving 63 paediatric patients between 0 and 12 years of age and 24 adolescents 
between 12 and 18 years of age with severe haemophilia A no difference in the safety profile of 
turoctocog alfa was observed between paediatric patients and adults. 
In all trials 34 medication errors were reported, most of them were dosing errors. The applicant stated 
that no adverse events have been associated with medication errors. They were related to trial 
procedures or errors of human error nature. In contrast to the clinical trial programme turoctocog alfa 
will be marketed as powder in a vial for reconstitution together with 4.3 ml solvent in a prefilled 
syringe with a scale, which will minimize dosing errors. Together with the instruction for use the 
applicant believes that the preventative measures are appropriate to mitigate and minimise the risk of 
medication errors. This explanation is acknowledged and for the time being no further statement in the 
SmPC is regarded necessary. 
The observed increase of hepatic parameters of several patients can mainly be explained by positive 
hepatitis C antibody tests. The frequency of headache-episodes within all study-phases was relatively 
high. But, only one event of headache was reported by the investigator to be probably related to 
turoctocog alfa. In addition, there was no association to the most recent dose of turoctocog alfa. 
Infusion speed was not recorded. 
The presented analysis of serious adverse events includes one fatal case which is acceptable and is 
consistent with the anticipated safety-profile. 
Allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible with turoctocog alfa. The product contains traces of 
hamster proteins, which in some patients may cause allergic reactions. If symptoms of hypersensitivity 
occur, patients should be advised to discontinue use of the medicinal product immediately and contact 
their physician. Patients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including 
hives, generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension, and anaphylaxis. 
In case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented. 
No clinically relevant dose-related changes have been observed for parameters of haematology, 
biochemistry and urinanalysis. 
There was one patient with a positive initial FVIII inhibitor test. But, this sole result could not be 
repeated by a test of a new blood sample. In addition, no influence on FVIII activity could be observed 
at the time of the positive inhibitor test. Therefore, a laboratory error or other interferences might be 
Assessment report  
EMA/612026/2013 
Page 99/108 
 
  
  
a possible explanation. In conclusion, no inhibitor development was detected in any patient treated 
with turoctocog alfa.  
The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the 
management of individuals with haemophilia A. These inhibitors are usually IgG immunoglobulins 
directed against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) per 
ml of plasma using the modified assay. The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the exposure to 
factor VIII, the risk being highest within the first 20 exposure days. Rarely, inhibitors may develop after 
the first 100 exposure days.  
Cases of recurrent inhibitor (low titre) have been observed after switching from one factor VIII product 
to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a previous 
history of inhibitor development. Therefore, it is recommended to monitor all patients carefully for 
inhibitor occurrence following any product switch.  
In general, all patients treated with coagulation factor VIII products should be carefully monitored for 
the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observation and laboratory test. If the expected 
factor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate 
dose, testing for factor VIII inhibitor presence should be performed. In patients with high levels of 
inhibitor, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered. 
Management of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of 
haemophilia and factor VIII inhibitors. 
It is strongly recommended that every time that turoctocog alfa is administered to a patient, the name 
and batch number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the 
batch of the medicinal product. 
Development of anti-host cell protein antibodies was observed in some patients at different time 
points. Only few patients changed from anti-CHO negative to anti-CHO positive or had transient 
positive anti-CHO results. 
Turoctocog alfa should not be used if the patient is hypersensitive to the active substance or to any of 
the excipients listed in section 6.1 of the SmPC or for known allergic reaction to hamster protein. 
After reconstitution this medicinal product contains 0.31 mmol sodium (7 mg ) per ml of reconstituted 
solution. To be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. 
No interaction studies have been performed with turoctocog alfa. 
No symptoms of overdose with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics.  
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via their national reporting systems. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Clinical safety has been analysed from the data of all clinical trials. Evaluation in general follows the 
currently valid clinical guideline. The presented results are considered to be acceptable. No

unexpected patterns in the reported adverse events and serious adverse events were observed. The 
safety and tolerability of turoctocog alfa treatment displays no differences between children and adults. 
As of the cut-off date (1 May 2012), no patients developed FVIII inhibitors or thromboembolic events. 
The safety database is considered to be sufficient to support the marketing authorisation of turoctocog 
alfa.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Turoctocog alfa, a newly developed recombinant Factor VIII with a 21 amino acid residue truncated 
B-domain, is intended for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A 
(congenital factor VIII deficiency). Pharmacokinetic properties of turoctocog alfa were found to be 
similar to that of other licensed FVIII products. Furthermore, in the main three clinical trials, turoctocog 
alfa was shown to prevent and treat bleedings in paediatric and adults with severe Haemophilia A as 
well as maintaining haemostasis in haemophilia A patients during surgery. The safety database 
submitted in the application provides sufficient information on the adverse events associated with 
turoctocog alfa treatment. No significant risks have been identified regarding the safety and tolerability 
of turoctocog alfa as compared to similar Factor VIII products. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Patients receiving on-demand treatment were not included in the studies. In contrast to prophylaxis 
patients, who experience late bleeds, on-demand patients may stay on very low endogenous factor VIII 
levels for a long time and will differ in their needs and consumption in the case of a bleed. Since more 
than 50% of adult haemophilia A patients require on-demand treatment, the administration of 
turoctocog alfa for on-demand treatment should be addressed. Further, the overall frequency and 
pattern of bleeds during on-demand treatment should also be investigated as it will differ compared to 
breakthrough bleeding during prophylactic treatment. Therefore, the CHMP recommends to collect the 
bleeding pattern and consumption data from treatment of at least 10 PTPs receiving on-demand 
treatment with turoctocog alfa for a minimum of 6 months in the ongoing study and to provide the 
results to the Agency after marketing authorisation. 
There were no previously untreated patients included in the studies. There were also no haemostasis 
data for elderly patients. This missing information is included in the safety concerns in the RMP. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
There were no new or unexpected unfavourable effects found in Haemophilia A patients treated with 
turcoctocog alfa. The most commonly reported ADRs were increase in hepatic enzymes and injection 
site reaction. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
No inhibitor development was detected in any patient treated with turoctocog alfa. Although the 
number of patients included in the database exceeds current guideline requirements, the safety 
database is relatively small in order to determine whether there is development of inhibitors and/or 
immunogenicity in patients treated with turoctocog alfa or whether there is a similar or even lower risk 
of developing inhibitors compared to other FVIII products. Inhibitor development was identified as an 
important identified risk and is being monitored through the RMP.

Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The clinical efficacy data was considered robust and suggests that the efficacy of turoctocog alfa is 
comparable to other FVIII products for the prevention and treatment of breakthrough bleedings and 
reaching haemostasis, including management of surgical interventions in previously treated patients 
suffering from Haemophilia A. Dosing of FVIII products is very individual and the recommended dosage 
information in the SmPC is based on clinical experience with other FVIII products and supported by the 
results from the clinical trials with turoctocog alfa. There is missing data for patients using on-demand 
treatment. However, this missing data does not affect the robustness of the efficacy data in the clinical 
study.  
The safety database has sufficient number of patients across all clinical trials to evaluate the safety and 
tolerability of turoctocog alfa before marketing authorisation. The adverse events reported are 
considered similar to that reported for other licensed FVIII products. There were no patients that 
developed FVIII inhibitors and no thromboembolic events occurred until the cut-off date for serious 
adverse events (10 April 2013).  The extension trial is on-going and will provide further data on serious 
adverse events, inhibitors and hypersensitivity reactions. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Based on the results of the pharmacokinetics studies NN7008-3522, NN7008-3893, NN7008-3600, 
NN7008-4015, pivotal study NN7008-3543, paediatric study NN7008-3545 and the extension trial 
NN7008-3568, the benefits of turoctocog alfa treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with 
haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency) outweighed the adverse events (most commonly 
reported ADRs increase in hepatic enzymes and injection site reaction). Turoctocog alfa can be used for 
all age groups. Therefore, the CHMP considers that the benefit-risk balance for turoctocog alfa 
treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency) 
is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Novoeight in the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with 
haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency) is favourable and therefore recommends  the

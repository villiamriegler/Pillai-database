1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
AbbVie Deutschland GmbH & Co. KG submitted on 25 November 2021 extensions of the marketing 
authorisation. 
The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) applied for:  
- an addition of a new strength (600 mg), addition of a new pharmaceutical form (concentrate for 
solution for infusion), and addition of a new route of administration (intravenous use). 
- an addition of a new strength (360mg), for solution for injection (in cartridge) for subcutaneous use. 
The above new presentations are proposed for a new indication: 
Skyrizi is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's 
disease who have had an inadequate response to, lost response to, or were intolerant to conventional 
therapy or a biologic therapy. 
The RMP (version 4.5) is updated in accordance. 
1.2.  Legal basis, dossier content 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008 and Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 
1234/2008, (2) points (c) (d) (e) - Extensions of marketing authorisations. 
1.3.  Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0230/2018 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP was not yet completed as some measures were 
deferred. 
1.4.  Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
1.4.1.  Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the MAH did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Crohn’s Disease (CD) is a chronic relapsing, remitting inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal (GI) 
tract, the cause of which remains unknown. Extra-intestinal manifestations include ocular 
inflammation, arthropathies, skin lesions and a spectrum of hepatic diseases.  
CD encompasses a spectrum of clinical and pathological processes manifested by focal asymmetric, 
transmural, and occasionally granulomatous inflammation which can affect any segment of the GI 
tract. 
The exact cause of CD is still unknown but is hypothesized to be the result of a dysregulated immune 
system in the context of a genetically susceptible individual. It is thought that a combination of a 
patient's genetics, microbiome, immune response, and the environment result in an excessive and 
abnormal immune response in the gut that results in pathology seen in CD. 
The Marketing Authorization Holder (MAH) applies for the following indication for Skyrizi 
(risankizumab) in CD: 
‘Skyrizi is indicated for the treatment of patients 16 years and older with moderately to severely active 
Crohn's disease who have had an inadequate response to, lost response to, or were intolerant to 
conventional therapy or a biologic therapy, or if such therapies are not advisable.’ 
The proposed posology is RZB 600 mg administered by intravenous infusion at Week 0, Week 4, and 
Week 8, followed by RZB 360 mg administered by subcutaneous injection at Week 12, and every 8 
weeks thereafter. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
The incidence of CD worldwide has increased over the last three decades, particularly in newly 
industrialized countries. CD incidence is highest in North America and Europe, with estimates of 23.8 
and 15 per 100,000 person-years in North America and Europe, respectively. The burden of CD also 
remains substantial, with the highest prevalence estimates in Europe (322 per 100,000 persons) and 
North America (319 per 100,000 persons). 
The incidence of CD worldwide has increased over the last 3 decades, particularly in newly 
industrialized countries.

EMA/887275/2022  
Page 10/258 
 
 
 
 
 
2.1.3.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
The disease affects the GI tract discontinuously from mouth to anus, but most commonly the disease is 
located both in ileum and colon (approximately 40%), followed by a disease in the small bowel only 
(approximately 30%), in the colon only (approximately 25%), and other locations (approximately 5%). 
Some patients may have a continuously clinically active disease. A diagnosis is usually based on 
composite clinical and pathological features and the exclusion of alternative disease states.  
CD has been classified by disease phenotype into primarily inflammatory disease, stricturing disease or 
penetrating disease modified by the presence of upper gastrointestinal or perianal disease (in up to 
20%) (Montreal classification 2005). Over the course of the disease, phenotype commonly changes 
from predominantly inflammatory disease to stricturing and/or penetrating disease.  
CD may present with symptoms of fatigue, prolonged diarrhoea with or without gross bleeding, 
abdominal pain, weight loss, and fever. The major signs and symptoms are diarrhoea, abdominal pain 
and weight loss, partly determined by the anatomical location and the severity of the disease. There 
may be no direct correlation between an individual’s symptoms and endoscopic and radiological 
findings. 
2.1.4.  Management 
The goal of treating CD is achieving and maintain symptomatic and endoscopic remission. Treatment of 
CD is a sequential continuum of induction to treat acute disease and maintenance to maintain response 
or remission. 
Remission can be achieved either by medical treatment or surgery. Medical therapy recommended by 
clinical guidelines includes corticosteroids, immunosuppressant drugs and biologics (anti-tumour 
necrosis factor (TNF) α agents and adhesion molecule inhibitors). Nutritional support has a role as 
primary therapy (in children) or as adjunct to other treatment. When medical treatment is 
unsuccessful or with certain complications, surgery is indicated. More than 70% of patients with ileal 
disease will require surgery at least once during the course of their disease (Guideline on the 
development of new medicinal products for the treatment of Crohn’s Disease, CPMP/EWP/2284/99 R2, 
28 June 2018). 
Treatment of moderately to severely active CD consists of conventional pharmaceutical therapies such 
as aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and immunomodulators [e.g., thiopurines and methotrexate], as 
well as biologic therapies. While frequently used, aminosalicylates and oral locally acting corticosteroids 
are of limited benefit and not recommended for long-term treatment. 
Systemic corticosteroids, while recommended for short-term use, are ineffective as maintenance 
therapy, do not consistently achieve mucosal healing, and even short-term use may be accompanied 
by important AEs (such as bone loss, mood disorder, insomnia, hypertension, elevated blood glucose, 
narrow angle glaucoma, acne, weight gain, and hypoadrenalism). 
Immunomodulators have a slow onset of action, have limited efficacy and are associated with AEs, 
such as allergic reactions, pancreatitis, myelosuppression, nausea, infections, hepatotoxicity, and 
malignancy. 
The advent of biologics has revolutionized treatment of patients with moderately to severely active 
Crohn's disease. However, despite the benefits of available biologic therapies, such as infliximab, 
adalimumab, certolizumab, natalizumab, vedolizumab, and ustekinumab, many patients do not 
respond to initial treatment (primary non-response) or lose treatment over time (secondary loss of 
response).

An important area of unmet need is treatment of paediatric patients with CD, where the potential 
impact of uncontrolled CD on growth, pubertal and emotional development, underlines the need for 
safe and efficacious treatment. 
2.2.  About the product 
Risankizumab (RZB) is a humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody (mAb) that 
selectively binds with high affinity to the p19 subunit of the human cytokine interleukin (IL)-23. By 
blocking IL-23 from binding to its receptor, RZB inhibits IL-23 dependent cell signaling and release of 
pro inflammatory cytokines, and thus has the potential to treat immune-mediated inflammatory 
diseases including CD. 
The pharmacological classification of RZB is:  
Immunosuppressants, interleukin inhibitors, ATC code: L04AC18 
RZB is approved for marketing in the European Union (EU) (Skyrizi; EU/1/19/1361/001-3), United 
States (US), Japan, and other countries for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in 
adults. RZB is approved for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis in the EU, USA, Japan and Russia. 
RZB is being developed for the treatment of other indications, including CD and ulcerative colitis. 
2.3.  Type of Application and aspects on development 
This is an Extension Application for two new dose strengths and presentations to support the new 
indication in Crohn’s Disease. 
The MAH applied for the following indication for Skyrizi (risankizumab) in CD: 
‘Skyrizi is indicated for the treatment of patients 16 years and older with moderately to severely active 
Crohn's disease who have had an inadequate response to, lost response to, or were intolerant to 
conventional therapy or a biologic therapy, or if such therapies are not advisable.’ 
The proposed posology is RZB 600 mg administered by intravenous infusion at Week 0, Week 4, and 
Week 8, followed by RZB 360 mg administered by subcutaneous injection at Week 12, and every 8 
weeks thereafter. The MAH has developed two new dose strengths and presentations to support the 
new indication Crohn’s Disease: 
-  Vial containing 600 mg of Risankizumab (concentrate for solution for infusion) for i.v. 
administration: Crohn’s Disease induction treatment 
-  Cartridge containing 360 mg of Risankizumab (solution for injection) co-packaged with a 
device (on-body injector, OBI) for s.c. administration: Crohn’s Disease maintenance treatment 
The CE mark was not available for submission with this initial dossier. At the pre-submission meeting, 
EMA confirmed that for medical devices that are co-packaged, it is not required to submit the CE-
certificate as part of the MAA dossier and MAHs have the responsibility to ensure the co packaged 
device is CE marked in accordance with the relevant legislation on medical devices prior to placing the 
product on the market. 
The MAH informed EMA (9 November 2021) that the device manufacturer is in progress to obtain the 
CE mark from the Notified Body and the CE mark may be available only later in the process. 
In support of this application the RZB clinical development program to demonstrate the safety and 
efficacy of risankizumab (RZB) for the treatment of patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s 
Disease (CD) who are 16 years of age and older for CD includes:

2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The active substance (AS) risankizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody of the IgG1 isotype with 
engineered Fc region, directed against IL-23p19.  
Skyrizi is currently authorised as solution for subcutaneous injection: 
- 75 mg strength (75 mg in 0.83 mL) in pre-filled syringe (glass) + alcohol pads (packs of 2 each); 
- 150 mg strength (150 mg in 1 mL) in pre-filled syringe (glass) and pre-filled pen (glass) (pack of 1 
each). 
The scope of this line extension is the registration of new pharmaceutical form, new route of 
administration and new strengths as follows: 
- 360 mg solution for subcutaneous injection in a cartridge containing 360 mg of risankizumab in 2.4 
mL solution (concentration 150 mg/mL) co-packaged with an on-body injector (pack of 1 each, for 
single use); 
- 600 mg concentrate for solution for infusion in a single use vial containing 600 mg of risankizumab in 
10 mL of solution (concentration 60 mg/mL) (pack of 1 vial). 
The qualitative composition in excipients for the new presentations is the same as Skyrizi 150 mg 
solution for injection in pre-filled pen and pre-filled syringe. 
Elements of Quality by Design have been used in the pharmaceutical development of the finished 
product (e.g. formulation development), however no regulatory flexibility is applied for. 
2.4.2.  Active Substance 
2.4.2.1.  General information 
Risankizumab is composed of two heterodimers. Each of the heterodimers is composed of a heavy and 
a light polypeptide chain. Each heavy chain (γ HC) is composed of 449 amino acids and each light 
chain (κ LC) contains 214 amino acids. The active substance, risankizumab is a humanised IgG1 
monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to IL-23p19 and therefore inhibits binding of IL-23 to its 
receptor. The framework of the antibody has been engineered with two mutations in the Fc region, 
Leu234Ala and Leu235Ala to reduce the potential effector function. The C-terminal lysine of the heavy 
chain has been deleted to reduce potential charge heterogeneity. Each HC contains a single N-linked 
glycosylation site at asparagine 297. The predicted molecular weight (MW) of aglycosylated, native 
risankizumab is 146 kDa.

2.4.2.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
A) Skyrizi 360 mg solution for injection in a cartridge 
The AS used to manufacture the finished product (FP) for the cartridge presentation is produced using 
the approved CMC2 process. As part of this application, sections S.2.1, S.2.5 and S.2.6 for this 
manufacturing process have been updated. The active substance is manufactured at Boehringer 
Ingelheim Pharma GmbH & Co. KG, Birkendorfer Str. 65, 88397 Biberach a.d.R., Germany. The MAH 
provided a summary of the shipping process qualification report to justify shipment of the CMC2 AS 
from Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma (BI) in Germany to the pre-filled cartridge FP site, using the 
currently approved shipping process. This is acceptable. 
All sites involved in the manufacture, control and testing of the AS operate in accordance with EU GMP. 
B) Skyrizi 600 mg concentrate for solution for infusion 
The AS is manufactured at AbbVie Bioresearch Center Inc., 100 Research Drive, Worcester, MA 01605, 
USA with a new version of the process is largely aligned with the authorised CMC2 process approved 
under EU procedure EMEA/H/C/004759/X/0012.  
All sites involved in the manufacture, control and testing of the AS operate in accordance with EU GMP. 
The new procedure has been well described. The MAH has provided information on the buffer 
composition to be used throughout the procedure. Process parameters for this step have been 
provided and is considered appropriate. 
Control of materials 
The cell banks and the raw materials are similar to those used in manufacture of the currently 
approved active substance.  
Details of compendial and non-compendial raw materials are provided. Acceptable specifications are 
registered for all non-compendial raw materials. 
Changes are being introduced for the CMC2 process and the material of construction have been 
registered in the dossier and a certificates of analyses (COA) for both has been provided and found 
satisfactory. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Critical process parameters (CPPs), acceptable ranges, and associated critical quality attributes (CQAs) 
are aligned to the approved process or tighter, and three control tests for bioburden, endotoxin, and 
step yield are included which is considered appropriate as they are in line with the currently approved 
in-process controls (IPCs). 
Hold times and holding conditions for process intermediates are site specific and were re-established 
for the ABC site.  The hold times are supported based on hold time validation studies.  Overall the 
control strategy in terms of CPPs and IPCs is considered acceptable to ensure adequate control of the 
active substance manufacturing process.  
Details of the qualification of the IPC analytical methods are also presented. All methods are the same 
as the approved CMC2 process at the ABL site. 
Process validation 
CHMP assessment report on group of extensions of marketing authorisation  
EMA/887275/2022  
Page 14/258 
 
 
 
 
Process performance qualification (PPQ) runs were performed on consecutive batches. IPC and process 
parameter results, including CPPs and non-CPPs, have been provided for each manufacturing step for 
each of the process performance qualification (PPQ) batches. All IPCs met their acceptance criteria for 
the cell culture stage, primary recovery and capture and fine purification. 
As the new process is aligned with the CMC2 process, full viral clearance studies were not performed, 
this is agreed. However, viral clearance studies were performed using the new process conditions. 
Impurity validation has been performed which adequately demonstrates the process is sufficient to 
remove process related impurities.  
The majority of the hold times for the process intermediates can be considered validated based on the 
data provided, however, a request was made to provide sufficient data to support the process 
intermediate hold time point. The data provided to support this hold time has been provided and found 
acceptable.   
The reprocessing validation study is supported by process characterisation studies. 
Shipping validation for the risankizumab CMC2 active substance manufactured at Boehringer Ingelheim 
(BI) in Biberach, Germany, and transported to the finished product manufacturing site at AbbVie 
Biotechnology, Ltd. (ABL) in Puerto Rico has been previously provided during EU procedure 
EMEA/H/C/004759/X/0012. An equivalency study demonstrated that shipment of AS from BI to ABL is 
comparable to shipping of risankizumab AS manufactured at ABC to the FP manufacturing site. 
There are no changes to the container closure system from the registered container closure system. 
Manufacturing process development 
A detailed description has been provided on the manufacturing process development, including the 
control strategy, manufacturing process history, process characterization studies, impurity clearance 
studies, and extractables and leachables assessment. 
A new process characterisation study (PCS) was performed in the scaled-down model (SDM) 
representative of the commercial scale. The data from the SDM demonstrates it is equivalent to the 
large scale process. The proposed new CPP and process parameters are agreed. 
Characterisation 
The active substance has previously been characterised in the approved marketing authorisation (MA) 
for the 90 mg/mL AS. An extended study was additionally performed on AS batches and included 
testing to evaluate primary, secondary and higher order structures, heterogeneity, biological activity. 
The characterisation studies have been carried out in a very comprehensive manner and cover all 
relevant aspects for a monoclonal antibody. The results of the extended characterisation study 
demonstrate the formulation or process changes made did not impact the structure, physicochemical 
characteristics or biological activity of risankizumab. 
2.4.2.3.  Specification 
The tests, analytical procedures and acceptance criteria listed are largely the same as the CMC2 AS, 
these specifications are considered acceptable. 
The proposed panel of release tests cover identity, quantity, purity, potency, charge and microbial 
assurance. In general, the panel of tests are in line with ICH Q6B and are considered appropriate for 
routine control of a monoclonal antibody both at release and shelf life. The specification acceptance 
criteria are clinically qualified.

Analytical methods 
The analytical methods have been sufficiently described and are aligned with the authorised CMC2 150 
mg/mL analytical tests apart from the HCP test. The new HCP version 2 procedure was approved as 
part of a Type II variation (EMEA/H/C/004759/II/0019/G). 
The analytical procedures have been appropriately validated in accordance with ICH Q2(R1).  
Compendial methods have been verified as appropriate for their intended use while the non-
compendial methods have been appropriately validated. No new methods are being used, therefore, 
the majority of the validation has been previously assessed and found acceptable. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data is provided. The results are within the specifications and confirm consistency of the 
manufacturing process.  
Reference materials 
The approach to reference standards has not changed from the approved dossier. The current 
reference standards were assessed during the initial marketing authorisation and continue to be 
acceptable, and the protocol for establishing new primary reference standards is appropriate. 
2.4.2.4.  Stability 
Stability studies have been performed in accordance with ICH guidelines for testing frequency and 
storage conditions.  Overall the data provided support of the claimed shelf-life for active substance.   
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Two presentations are proposed for the finished product (FP), a single use 600 mg/10 mL vial, and a 
360 mg/ 2.4 mL pre-filled cartridge (PFC) co-packaged with an on-body delivery system (OBDS) 
device. Each presentation will be addressed separately where necessary in this report.  
600 mg/10 mL vial 
Skyrizi 600 mg/10.0 mL vial is supplied as a sterile solution for intravenous administration (IV) after 
dilution with 5% dextrose in water. The solution is colourless to slightly yellow and clear to slightly 
opalescent. The FP is a buffered and preservative-free solution that is diluted to an isotonic solution for 
IV administration. 
360 mg/2.4 mL Pre-filled Cartridge (PFC) and OBDS combination 
Skyrizi 360 mg/2.4 mL PFC is supplied as a sterile solution at a concentration of 150 mg/mL for 
subcutaneous administration. The PFC finished product is a buffered, isotonic, preservative-free, 
colorless to yellow, clear to slightly opalescent solution. Skyrizi 360 mg/2.4 mL PFC is to be 
administered using an on-body delivery system (OBDS) device and is supplied as a sterile finished 
product solution for subcutaneous administration in a PFC assembled with a telescopic screw assembly 
(TSA) co-packaged with an OBDS device. 
Development of the 60 mg/mL vial formulation and the 150 mg/mL PFC formulation is based on the 
manufacturer’s experience with the authorised 90 and 150 mg/mL PFS formulations. The excipients are 
standard for parenteral presentations and extensive formulation development data including design of 
CHMP assessment report on group of extensions of marketing authorisation  
EMA/887275/2022  
Page 16/258 
 
 
 
 
experiments (DoE) multivariate studies are provided to establish a formulation design space for the 
vial and PFC formulations. The formulation robustness data show that the chosen formulations are 
appropriate to control the stability of the vial and PFC presentations over the intended shelf life. 
The process flow for the FP manufacturing of the vial and the PFC presentations is clearly outlined and 
there is a good understanding of the risks and critical quality attributes (CQA) identified at each stage 
of the process. Based on the Quality Target Product Profiles (QTPP) and CQAs, an initial risk 
assessment was conducted for the manufacturing process development to identify variables and 
process parameters that may have a potential impact on the CQAs. The manufacturing steps were then 
assessed by process characterisation studies evaluating the significance of changing process 
parameters on the quality of the product. Justification for the proposed critical process parameters 
(CPP) is considered acceptable. Mixing times and speeds are supported by computational fluid 
dynamics studies (CFD) and are validated. Filtration pressure is listed as a CPP for the sterile filtration 
process step and small-scale studies were conducted at worst-case filtration pressures demonstrating 
it does not impact finished product quality. Process parameters are controlled. Extractables and 
leachables testing was carried out for the contact materials DS bags, bioburden reduction filter, tubing 
and single use bags. Extractables with a maximum daily exposure (MDE) above the threshold of 
toxicological concern (TTC) were assessed for toxicological risk and considered to pose negligible risk 
to the patient. The leachables studies for both presentations are ongoing and any leachables identified 
above the calculated PDE will be reported.  
600 mg/10.0 mL Vial 
The proposed commercial manufacturing process of Skyrizi 600 mg/10.0 mL vial was established 
based on the clinical manufacturing process at the finished product manufacturing site. Comparability 
was demonstrated between the commercial 60 mg/mL formulation and the 90 mg/mL formulation used 
in the three clinical phase 3 studies. Comparability was based on FP release data, extended 
characterisation and stability study data. Differences in the versions of the process are described and 
include the new AS manufacturing process and AS formulation, a change in the FP formulation 
(including protein concentration), a new FP manufacturing site, batch size and vial size. Seven 600 
mg/10 mL vial FP batches have been manufactured to the commercial process and includes three PPQ 
batches.  
360 mg/2.4 mL PFC 
The proposed commercial manufacturing process for the Skyrizi 150 mg/mL PFC was established based 
on prior knowledge gained during the development of the Skyrizi 90 mg/mL PFS and the Skyrizi 150 
mg/mL PFS process development. The intended manufacturing process for the Skyrizi 150 mg/mL PFC 
is similar to the versions of the process used for Skyrizi 90 mg/mL PFS and Skyrizi 150 mg/mL PFS. 
The commercial manufacturing process for Skyrizi 150 mg/mL PFC was implemented at the FP 
manufacturing site. Comparability was demonstrated between the commercial 150 mg/mL formulation 
and the 90 mg/mL formulation used in the phase 3 clinical studies. Comparability was based on FP 
release data, extended characterisation and stability study data. During development, two different fill 
volumes were explored for Skyrizi 150 mg/mL PFC to provide the required doses for clinical studies, 
resulting in Skyrizi 180 mg/1.2 mL PFC and Skyrizi 360 mg/2.4 mL PFC. Development experiments 
may have been performed using one or both of the finished product presentations, as applicable, for 
increased process experience and batch data.  
360 mg/2.4 mL OBDS Combination Product 
The OBDS device development is described and design choice of the device and rationale is provided. 
The functional aspects of the device in combination with the PFC are addressed including minimising 
needle stick injuries, delivery initiation force, and needle insertion depth and delivery profile. The dose

delivery and duration is adequately addressed in the design. The microbiological attributes and 
compatibility of the device with the finished product have been adequately addressed. There were 
minor changes made to the device during development to accommodate a new battery and these 
changes are considered acceptable and to have no impact on the device function.  
Adequate descriptions are provided for the components of the container closure for the 600 mg/10 mL 
vial. Schematics and specifications and example CoA for the vial, stopper and flip cap are provided. 
The components are manufactured in accordance with the appropriate Ph. Eur. monographs and are 
acceptable. The extractables and leachables study design is supported and the leachables study is 
ongoing. A commitment has been provided to report any leachable identified above the calculated PDE 
over the duration of the studies.  
The container closure for the 360 mg/2.4 mL PFC consists of a pre-filled cartridge (PFC). The septum 
and piston are laminated. The PFC cartridge and piston are sterilised by and details of the sterilisation 
site are registered in the dossier, a certificate of ISO conformance is provided. Details of the methods, 
cycles and validation for sterilisation of the pistons and cartridge are provided in accordance with the 
EMA guideline on sterilisation (EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/850374/2015).  
The information provided for the OBDS combination device is considered to be in accordance with the 
‘guideline on quality documentation for medicinal products when used with a medical device’ 
(EMA/CHMP/QWP/BWP/259165/2019) with cross reference made to 3.2.R for further general 
comments on the data provided to support the device. The OBDS device does not currently have a CE 
mark, however in accordance with EU legislation, a CE mark is required prior to marketing the product 
with the OBDS. Therefore, some aspects of OBDS will be assessed by the relevant Notified Body. 
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The name, address, and responsibility of each manufacturer, and each proposed production site or 
facility involved in the manufacturing and testing of the Vial and PFC presentation is provided and the 
sites are appropriately GMP certified. 
The manufacturing process is standard for both the vial and PFC presentations. The vial manufacturing 
process includes AS thawing, bulk solution homogenisation and pooling, compounding of bulk FP 
solution, bioburden reduction filtration, storage and mixing of the bulk solution, sterile filtration, filling 
and stopper setting, crimping of vials and visual inspection. Vials are filled following sterile filtration 
and are 100% visually inspected. The PFC manufacturing includes AS thawing and equilibration of 
formulated AS, bulk solution homogenisation, pooling and mixing of the bulk solution, bioburden 
reduction filtration, bulk solution storage and mixing, sterile filtration, filling and piston setting of the 
cartridges, and visual inspection of the PFC. Cartridges are filled following sterile filtration and are 
100% visually inspected. The hold times for the versions of the manufacturing process for both the vial 
and PFC are the accumulated time over the FP manufacturing process.  
Ranges have been registered for CPPs and IPCs and have been justified in the dossier for each process 
and the control strategies are for the most part aligned with the approved 90 and 150 mg/ml 
formulations and considered acceptable.  
The manufacturing process was validated based on production of consecutive batches at routine 
production scale. The validation is acceptable and the process is demonstrated to be capable of 
producing batches of consistent quality. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is 
capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process 
controls are considered to be adequate.

2.4.3.3.  Product specification 
The proposed release tests are in line with the expectations of ICHQ6B and the Ph. Eur. monograph on 
monoclonal antibodies and are therefore acceptable. Furthermore, the tests for the Skyrizi 600 
mg/10.0 mL vial are the same as for the approved 150 mg/ml PFS presentation with the exception of 
functional tests for the PFS. The FP release limits are based on the AS shelf life limits and found 
acceptable. To assess shelf-life limits for Skyrizi 60 mg/mL FP, statistical evaluations were conducted 
and proposed limits are supported. 
The proposed release tests for the 360 mg/2.4 mL PFC product are in line with the expectations of 
ICHQ6B and the Ph. Eur. monograph on monoclonal antibodies and are therefore acceptable. 
Furthermore, the tests for the bulk 360 mg/2.4 mL PFC FP are the same as those approved for the 150 
mg/ml PFS presentation with functional tests for the maximum force for the assembled PFC-TSA. To 
assess shelf-life limits for Skyrizi 360 mg/2.4 mL FP, statistical evaluations were conducted, and 
proposed limits are supported. 
Additional functional tests are included for the OBDS combination. Packaging integrity, device interface 
functionality and label controls are also included, and these specifications are considered appropriate. 
The shelf life acceptance criteria are identical to the release specifications. 
Analytical methods 
The analytical procedures used for release and shelf life testing of the vial and PFC FP are same for the 
AS, and described in the respective AS section. Additional methods are used for vial and PFC FP release 
testing. Details of the in-house methods and validation are provided in the dossier and are acceptable. 
For the OBDS combination product, descriptions are provided. 
Batch analysis 
Batch data has been provided for vial and PFC FP batches The batches include stability batches, clinical 
batches and PPQ batches. All the batches were within specification and show consistent results 
indicating a controlled manufacturing process. Data are also provided for OBDS combination product 
batches. The data shows that the finished product manufacturing process results in batches of 
consistent quality. PPQ batches were tested for and met all specifications for the OBDS combination 
product. 
Reference materials 
For discussion on reference standards, please refer to the active substance part of this report. 
2.4.3.4.  Stability of the product 
For the 600 mg/10 mL vial, stability testing was performed in line with ICH Q5C. Up to 24 months 
stability data is available from the primary stability batches at long term conditions (2- 8 °C). In 
addition, up to 18 months stability data is available from the PPQ batches at long term conditions. Up 
to 6 months data is provided at accelerated and stressed conditions. Primary stability and PPQ batches 
were manufactured at the proposed commercial manufacturing site are representative of the 
commercial process and are stored in the proposed container closure.  
A photostability study was performed according to the conditions outlined in ICH Q1B. Results indicate 
that the FP is light sensitive but that the intended secondary packaging is sufficient to protect from 
light.  
Product quality was not affected during dilution, storage or by contact with the infusion materials. 
Direct sunlight should be avoided, and this is included in the SmPC. 
CHMP assessment report on group of extensions of marketing authorisation  
EMA/887275/2022  
Page 19/258 
 
 
 
 
For the 360 mg/2.4 mL PFC, stability testing was also performed in line with ICH Q5C. In addition to 
the stability data presented for the PFC, data is presented to support the functionality of the final 
assembled/blistered OBDS combination product.  
Up to 24 months stability data is available from the primary PFC stability batches at long term 
conditions (2- 8 °C). In addition, up to 12 months stability data is available from the 360 mg/2.4 ml 
PFC PPQ batches at long term conditions. Up to 6 months data is provided at accelerated and stressed 
conditions. Primary stability and PPQ batches were manufactured at the proposed commercial 
manufacturing site, are representative of the commercial process and are stored in the proposed 
container closure.  
The annual stability protocols are presented are acceptable. A temperature cycling study was 
performed for vial and PFC presentations and the results support the permitted temperature 
excursions. 
On the basis of the combined stability data from the PFC and the OBDS combination pack, a shelf-life 
of 24 months with storage conditions of 2 – 8 °C and a direction to protect from light. This is 
acceptable. 
In use stability of the OBDS combination product is addressed as part of the design verification and in 
the human factors engineering / usability engineering summative validation report. This will be 
assessed as part of the CE certification and cross reference is made to 3.2.R for general comments. 
2.4.3.5.  Adventitious agents 
CMC2 process 
The information provided for the adventitious agent safety evaluation for the AS used to manufacture 
the PFC presentation is identical to the authorised AS used to manufacture the pre-filler syringe 
presentation. The only difference is new BSE/TSE certifications for the FP container closure have been 
added which show compliance of no material of animal origin. This is acceptable. 
New version of CMC2 process 
The information provided for the adventitious agent safety evaluation for the AS used to manufacture 
the vial presentation is largely identical to the authorised AS used to manufacture the pre-filler syringe 
presentation. 
Modifications in this line extension and certificates of compliance from the supplier have been 
submitted to demonstrate compliance with the TSE Note for Guidance, these are deemed appropriate. 
No new raw materials of biological origin have been introduced during this procedure, therefore, the 
same approved raw materials used for the 150 mg/ml risankizumab AS manufacturing process are 
provided in this dossier.  
Viral clearance studies in accordance with ICHQ5A were performed. Viral clearance studies were 
performed within the manufacturing NORs established in S.2.2. The new viral studies presented are 
considered sufficient and have demonstrated no negative impact on viral clearance.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
In this line extension for these two new finished product presentations of risankizumab (vial and 
cartridge), there are two new active substance dossier sections provided. The AS used to manufacture 
the FP for the cartridge presentation will be the authorised CMC2 process. The information provided for 
the CMC2 process included clarification over the manufacturer’s operations, a qualification assessment 
CHMP assessment report on group of extensions of marketing authorisation  
EMA/887275/2022  
Page 20/258 
 
 
 
 
that demonstrated the shipping process for the 90 mg/mL and 150 mg/mL are comparable, and 
updated batches for the 10 mg/mL and 90 mg/mL AS batches produced from the CMC1 process and 
batches for the CMC2 process have been provided and all batches met the acceptance criteria.  
The active substance manufacturing process used for the production of 600 mg/10.0 mL Vial FP is the 
modified CMC2 process. The process is a standard manufacturing process for a monoclonal antibody. 
The manufacturing process is essentially the same as the validated and approved historical CMC2 AS 
versions of the process. The process has been well described and there has been some minor changes 
to the normal operating ranges and proven acceptable ranges. The comparability performed was very 
detailed and showed that the new process was comparable to the old versions of the process. 
Extended characterisation showed there has been no change to the mAb and it is identical to the 
previous versions of the process. No new impurities were identified. All specifications are the same as 
the authorised versions of the process and all the analytical methods are appropriately validated. The 
methods and acceptance criteria used for testing of specifications are appropriately justified. Long-
term storage was proposed for 24 months and has been supported by 24 months of data for batches. 
The FP is supplied as a 600 mg/10 mL vial (concentrate for solution for infusion) and as a 360 mg/2.4 
mL pre-filled cartridge (PFC) (solution for injection) co-packaged with an on body delivery system 
(OBDS) device. Sufficient formulation development data was provided to justify the final formulation. 
Comparability of the commercial manufacturing process for both the vial and PFC presentation was 
shown compared to the 90 mg/mL batches used in the phase 3 trials.  The manufacturing process is 
standard for a monoclonal antibody. Appropriate process development data was provided which 
supports the control strategy. The manufacturing process of the vial and the PFC has been 
appropriately validated. The specifications are largely aligned to the approved 90 and 150 mg/ml PFS 
presentation and are in accordance with current guidance. Specifications are provided for the 
functionality of the PFC when combined with the OBDS device and are acceptable. The analytical 
procedures have been appropriately validated and sufficient batch data has been provided.  
Sufficient documentation has been provided to support the use of the PFC and OBDS device. This 
included compatibility data, extractables and leachables studies and human factors studies. It is noted 
that the on-body delivery system will require CE marking prior to being placed on the market and will 
undergo conformity assessment by a notified body. Appropriate stability data has been provided to 
support the proposed 24 month shelf life for the vial presentation and 24 month shelf life for the PFC 
presentation.  
The safety of the product with respect to adventitious agents has been appropriately justified. The 
results of the viral clearance study demonstrated that the production process has sufficient capacity to 
inactivate or remove viruses. 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety.

2.4.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
Not applicable.  
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
Risankizumab is a humanized immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody directed against interleukin 
(IL)-23 p19 and is currently authorised for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and 
active psoriatic arthritis in adults (Skyrizi; EU/1/19/1361/001-3).   
This is an Extension Application for two new dose strengths and presentations to support the new 
indication Crohn’s Disease. Limited in vitro and in vivo primary pharmacology studies were conducted 
to support this application; no additional pharmacokinetic or toxicology studies were conducted. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
A limited package of nonclinical pharmacology studies was performed to support the new indication for 
the treatment of Crohn’s disease. 
An in vitro surface plasmon resonance study investigated the potential of risankizumab to bind to IL-23 
which is already bound to its receptor, IL-23R. The analysis revealed no binding of risankizumab to 
the IL-23/IL-23R complexes suggesting that it binds to a site involved in receptor binding and thereby 
prevents this interaction from occurring.  
Two additional in vivo studies were performed in mouse models of colitis. In both the anti-CD40-
induced model, and T cell transfer induced model, decreased disease severity was seen when the mice 
were treated with the surrogate mouse anti-IL-23p19 antibody as assessed by endoscopic examination 
and macrophage infiltration. These studies can be seen to serve as proof of concept of the potential 
efficacy of risankizumab in Crohn’s disease. 
2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The ability of risankizumab to induce ADCC or CDC was investigated. No activation of the FcγRIIIa 
mediated luciferase signal was seen in the ADCC reporter assay suggesting low potential for ADCC. In 
addition, no complement activation in human serum was observed with risankizumab, indicating no 
potential to elicit CDC activity.

2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No additional pharmacokinetic studies were conducted to support this application which is considered 
acceptable. The previously assessed pharmacokinetic studies for the original MAA, which investigated 
both IV and SC routes of administration, are considered sufficient to support this extension application. 
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
No new nonclinical toxicology studies have been performed. The previously assessed nonclinical 
toxicity studies are considered sufficient to support the current application for the treatment of Crohn’s 
disease. Considering that the dose for the new indication is higher than that authorised dose, the MAH 
has calculated new margins of safety from the NOAEL in the chronic repeat dose toxicity study in NHPs 
and the ePPND study in the same species. These indicate that exposures in excess of that seen 
clinically were achieved. 
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The European Medicines Agency's (EMA) "Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal 
Products for Human Use" states that an environmental risk assessment (ERA) must be provided for 
"products containing vitamins, electrolytes, amino acids, peptides, proteins, carbohydrates and lipids 
as active pharmaceutical ingredient(s)." However, the "ERA may consist of a justification for not 
submitting ERA studies, e.g., due to their nature they are unlikely to result in a significant risk to the 
environment." With this, the following justification is provided in support of not completing the full 
suite of Phase I and II environmental studies for the ERA to be submitted with the Marketing 
Authorisation Application for risankizumab. 
Risankizumab is an antibody (specifically a monoclonal immunoglobulin), and as such is a natural 
substance. The excretion of risankizumab has not specifically been studied, but it is expected that a 
substantial percentage of the dosed compound will be degraded (to small peptides and amino acids) in 
the body. Any risankizumab that is excreted would degrade within a wastewater treatment plant or in 
the environment. The use of risankizumab will not alter the concentration or distribution of these 
substances (small peptides and amino acids) in the environment. Therefore, environmental fate and 
effects studies are not warranted as patient use of risankizumab is unlikely to result in any exposure or 
risk to the environment. 
2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Only limited in vitro and in vivo primary pharmacology studies were conducted to support this 
application, and which provide proof of concept for the potential efficacy of risankizumab in the 
treatment of Crohn’s disease. 
No additional pharmacokinetic or toxicology studies were conducted which is acceptable and the 
previously assessed nonclinical toxicity studies are considered sufficient to support the current 
application. 
The active substance is a natural substance, the use of which will not alter the concentration or 
distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, risankizumab is not expected to pose a 
risk to the environment.

2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  pharmacokinetics,  pharmacodynamics,  immunogenicity,  and  exposure-response  relationships  for 
efficacy and safety of risankizumab have been well characterized in healthy subjects and subjects with 
moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The MAH submitted 4 phase I studies: M16-324 which compared 
the bioavailability of Rizankizumab following IV and different methods of SC administration and aimed 
to inform drug product development;  M19-128, which aimed  to  demonstrate bioequivalence  between 
the to be marketed product (administered SC via an ‘on-body delivery system’) and the formulation and 
method of administration used in the pivotal phase III studies; M16-533 and M17-381 investigating PK 
following administration of Rizankizumab to Japanese and Chinese subjects respectively. To support the 
registration in CD, additional clinical pharmacology assessments were conducted in two Phase II studies 
(Studies M15-993 and M15-989) and three pivotal Phase III studies (Studies M15-991, M16-006, and 
M16-000) in subjects with CD. 
Bioanalytical methods 
Risankizumab serum concentration  
During the previously approved line extension for the 150 mg/mL formulation of Skyrizi 
(EMEA/H/C/004759/X/012) in both pre-filled syringe and pre-filled pen, a bridging 
Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assay was developed and validated to quantitatively determine 
risankizumab (ABBV-066) concentration in human serum samples from clinical studies. The method 
validation was previously assessed during the line extension for Skyrizi 150 mg formulation in healthy 
and Psoriasis patient’s serum and deemed to have been suitably validated as per the Guideline on 
bioanalytical method validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009/Rev. 1). This method was also 
partially validated for selectivity/matrix interference for CD patient’s serums. The method was 
transferred and validation performed using healthy and CD patient’s serum. The defined assay 
performance specifications and the method validation carried are in general, in line with the Guideline 
on Bioanalytical method validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 rev.1 corr.2). Sample analysis for 
Risankizumab concentrations in human serum for the pivotal Phase 3 CD Studies was conducted at two 
sites. A cross-validation for the validated serum assay and results show the methods to be 
comparable.  
Anti-drug antibody assay 
The overall approach to measuring immunogenicity is in line with the recommendations of the EMA 
Guideline on Immunogenicity assessment of therapeutic proteins (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/14327/2006 Rev 
1) and the EMA Guideline on immunogenicity assessment of monoclonal antibodies intended for in vivo 
clinical use (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/86289/2010).   
The ADA method was validated as per the recommendations of the relevant EMA guidelines. The 
approach taken is acceptable and follows the principles of the previous method validations to establish 
cut-points for CD patients’ serum. 
A cross-validation for the validated serum assay was also performed. The data presented demonstrate 
full comparability of serum assay results. 
Neutralising antibody assay 
The MAH has provided an adequate method description and validation of the method used to evaluate 
neutralizing anti- Risankizumab (NAb) levels in human serum of healthy donors and CD patients. The 
overall approach to measuring immunogenicity is in line with the recommendations of the EMA 
CHMP assessment report on group of extensions of marketing authorisation  
EMA/887275/2022

Population PK Analyses 
The popPK analyses included data from subjects with moderately to severely active CD in Phase 2 
Studies M15-993 and M15-989, Phase 3 Induction Studies M15-991and M16-006, and Phase 3 
Maintenance Study M16-000 and healthy volunteers in Phase 1 Study M16-533. A total of 6851 
concentrations from 1404 subjects (1392 CD subjects and 12 healthy subjects) were included in the 
analyses. 
A previously developed popPK model that described risankizumab pharmacokinetics in patients with 
moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and CD served as the starting model for the analyses. The final

model was a two-compartment model with a first-order absorption for SC administration and first-
order elimination. Parameter estimates for the final model are presented in Table 1.

respectively, for a 70 kg subject. These estimates were similar to those in subjects with moderate to 
severe chronic plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.

Pharmacokinetic Model 
Impact of covariates on risankizumab exposures 
Simulations showed that only low baseline serum albumin (< 38 g/L) had potentially meaningful 
impact on the Week 12 trough exposure of risankizumab in CD subjects. These subjects were predicted 
to have on average 31% lower Week 12 trough exposures compared to subjects with serum albumin 
within the reference range (38 g/L to 44 g/L). The exposure metric that was used in the subsequent 
exposure response analysis was the average concentration, which is derived from the AUC and is 
within the 0.8 to 1.25 reference range (Figure 4). 
Besides baseline serum albumin, none of the other statistically significant covariates identified showed 
a meaningful impact on risankizumab exposures. Over the evaluated covariate ranges for body weight, 
faecal calprotectin, corticosteroid use, and creatinine clearance, risankizumab exposures were 
estimated to be within the default equivalence boundaries of 0.8 to 1.25 relative to the reference 
groups (Figure 4).

Absorption  
Bioavailability 
Study M16-324 was a Phase 1, single-dose, 4-arm, open-label, randomized, parallel-group study to 
determine the relative bioavailability of risankizumab and the extent of injection-site related pain 
following SC administration at varying rates and volumes of risankizumab in healthy subjects. The 
results of the study were used to inform the development of the "to-be-marketed" drug presentation 
for SC administration. The study enrolled 48 adult male subjects and randomised them to receive 
either: Three SC injections of 0.8 mL each (216 mg; Reference); 2.4 mL administered SC using a 
syringe pump over 3 minutes (216 mg; Test); 2.4 mL administered SC using a syringe pump over 6 
minutes (216 mg; Test); or one SC injection of 2 mL (180 mg; Test). Blood samples for analysis of 
risankizumab concentrations were collected on Days 1 (pre-dose), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 15, 29, 43, 
57, 85, 113, and 140. ADA samples were collected on Days 1 (pre-dose), 15, 29, 57, 85, and 140.

Baseline and treatment-emergent ADA incidence ranged from 8.3% to 25% and 0% to 50%, 
respectively, across all treatment arms, with no apparent impact on pharmacokinetics or safety. 
Bioequivalence 
Study M19-128 was a Phase 1, single-dose, randomized, open-label, multi-center study, comprised of 
two substudies, in healthy volunteers.  
Substudy 1 was designed to assess the relative bioavailability of risankizumab in the to-be-marketed 
360 mg OBDS (single SC administration of 2.4 mL) versus the 90 mg PFS (4 × SC administrations of 1 
mL) used in the Phase 3 CD studies. Additionally, Substudy 1 assessed the pharmacokinetics of 
risankizumab in a 180 mg OBDS following a single SC administration of 1.2 mL at the dose of 180 mg. 
Substudy 2 was designed to assess the relative bioavailability of risankizumab in the to-be-marketed 
600 mg liquid vial versus the 300 mg liquid vial used in the Phase 3 CD studies following a single IV 
administration of 1800 mg.  
The study recruited healthy male and female participants aged between 21 and 58 years old with a 
BMI of between 19-32 kg/m2. Enrolment was stratified by body weight as per the table below: 
A total of 394 subjects were randomized 4:4:1 in Sub-Study 1 and 1:1 in Sub-Study 2, and a total of 
393 subjects received a single dose of risankizumab as follows: 
CHMP assessment report on group of extensions of marketing authorisation  
EMA/887275/2022  
Page 35/258 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Baseline demographics and datasets analysed 
The mean age in groups 1 through 5 were 38.4, 37.9, 37.4, 39.3 and 40.6 years respectively. Mean 
BMI was 25.6, 25.5, 26.5, 25.6, and 25.5 kg/m2 for groups 1 through 5 respectively. 
Available data from all subjects (N = 393, Substudy 1 (N = 286) and Substudy 2 (N = 107)) were 
included in the safety analyses, and data from 356 subjects (Substudy 1 (N = 258) and Substudy 2 (N 
= 98)) who received risankizumab were included in the statistical analyses of the pharmacokinetic 
parameters, with the exceptions noted below. 
Substudy 1: 
• 
Ten subjects had OBDS-related dosing failures. One of those subjects did not receive a 
risankizumab dose and was excluded from all pharmacokinetic parameter calculations. 
•  One subject experienced drug leakage following OBDS drug administration. 
•  One subject violated the study protocol by enrolling in two treatment groups of Substudy 1 and 
thus had two unique subject IDs. 
• 
Eight subjects violated study protocol by enrolling in both Substudy 1 and Substudy 2, and 
thus had two unique subject IDs. 
• 
Eight subjects discontinued from the study and therefore had incomplete pharmacokinetic 
profiles that were not sufficient to allow for reliable non-compartmental estimates of 
pharmacokinetic parameters. 
Substudy 2: 
•  One subject (risankizumab 1800 mg IV, Group 4) withdrew consent on Day 2 and had only 24 
hours of concentration-time profile, which was not sufficient to allow for reliable non-
compartmental estimates of pharmacokinetic parameters. 
• 
Eight subjects violated study protocol by enrolling in both Substudy 1 and Substudy 2, and 
thus had two unique subject IDs.

Table 2 Geometric Mean (Arithmetic Mean, % CV) Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Risankizumab 
Following a Single SC Dose Administration in Healthy Subjects 
Following the administration of a single 360 mg SC dose, mean risankizumab concentrations in Group 2 
(360 mg OBDS × 1 SC injection) were higher during the absorption phase when compared to Group 1 
(90  mg  PFS  ×  4  SC  injections),  but  overlapping  pharmacokinetic  profiles  were  observed  during  the 
elimination phase. Thus, the pharmacokinetic parameters between the 90 mg PFS (4 × 90 mg/mL) and 
360  mg  OBDS  groups  were  largely  comparable  with  the  exception  of  a  higher  Cmax  for  the  360  mg 
OBDS group. The dose-normalized risankizumab concentration-time profiles were overlapping between 
Group 2 (360 mg OBDS × 1 SC injection) and Group 3 (180 mg OBDS × 1 SC injection), with comparable 
pharmacokinetic  parameters,  indicating  linearity  between  the  360  and  180  mg  SC  doses  when 
administered via the OBDS device. 
Following SC administration of a single 360 mg or 180 mg dose across Groups 1 to 3, median time to 
maximum  serum  concentrations  was  approximately  five  days  after  dosing  with  the  OBDS  device  and 
approximately seven days after dosing with PFS, however, the Tmax ranges overlapped across the three 
groups.  Risankizumab  t1/2  was  generally  comparable  across  drug  presentations  and  doses,  with 
harmonic means ranging from 26 to 28 days.

Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Study M15-993 
Study M15-993 was a Phase 2, proof-of-concept, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, 
multiple-dose, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to evaluate the efficacy of risankizumab in 
patients with moderately to severely active CD who were naïve to or previously treated with anti-tumor 
necrosis factor (TNF) therapy. A total of 121 subjects with active CD were randomized in a three-
period study.  
Approximate dose-proportional increases in risankizumab plasma trough concentrations were observed 
in subjects with CD who received risankizumab induction treatment of 200 mg IV and 600 mg IV at 
Weeks 0, 4, and 8 during Period 1. Comparable risankizumab trough concentrations relative to Period 
1 were observed during Period 2 in subjects who received 600 mg IV dose. Following the Period 3 
regimen of 180 mg SC q8w starting at Week 26, near steady-state levels were achieved by Week 42. 
CHMP assessment report on group of extensions of marketing authorisation  
EMA/887275/2022  
Page 41/258 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Treatment-emergent ADA-positive responses were observed in 8% (9/108) of the subjects who 
received at least one dose of risankizumab. The time to appearance of the first ADA-positive sample 
for the risankizumab-treated subjects ranged from 12 to 18 weeks following start of treatment. None 
of the ADA-positive subjects were found to have positive NAb assessment during the study. Although 
the number of ADA-positive subjects was limited, there did not appear to be any impact of ADA on 
risankizumab plasma concentrations. 
Study M15-989 
Study M15-989 was a Phase 2, open-label extension (OLE) study that investigated the long-term 
safety and efficacy of risankizumab in subjects with moderately to severely active CD who enrolled 
from Study M15-993. A total of 65 subjects were enrolled and received the following treatment: 
•  CDAI clinical response, but not CDAI clinical remission at Week 26 of Study M15-993; subjects 
started on risankizumab 180 mg SC q8w; 
•  CDAI clinical response and/or CDAI clinical remission at Week 52 of Study M15 993; subjects 
started on risankizumab 180 mg SC q8w; or 
•  Subjects with loss of response at Week 26 or Week 52 of Study M15-993 received 
risankizumab 600 mg IV at Weeks 0, 4, and 8; if subjects achieved CDAI clinical response 
and/or clinical remission at Week 12 they were continued on risankizumab 180 mg SC q8w. 
•  Subjects who completed Study M15-989 could elect to continue in Study M16-000 Sub-Study 3 
(Phase 3 OLE study). 
Trough plasma concentration data at the time relative to first SC dosing are summarized for all 
enrolled subjects regardless of their SC treatment initiation time during the study to provide an 
overview of risankizumab exposure following maintenance therapy. Following administration of 
risankizumab 180 mg SC q8w dose in all enrolled subjects with moderate to severe CD, steady-state 
plasma exposures were reached by Week 24 after the first SC dose, and median trough concentrations 
ranged from 3.66 μg/mL to 4.23 μg/mL. Overall, out of 65 subjects who received at least one dose of 
risankizumab during the study, eight subjects (12%) developed largely low titer ADAs (titer ranged 
from 1 to 64) that were not neutralizing. Development of ADAs did not appear to have a clear impact 
on risankizumab plasma exposures. 
Risankizumab exposure appeared to be impacted by the development of ADA in one subject, but no 
such observations were made in the other ADA positive subjects. Overall, considering the variability 
across individuals in trough concentrations and the small number of ADA positive subjects (8/65 
[12%]), risankizumab trough plasma concentrations appear to be largely comparable between ADA 
positive and ADA negative subjects. These results indicated that the development of ADAs did not have 
a consistent apparent impact on risankizumab plasma exposures. 
Intra-subject assessment of the effect of ADA positive response on risankizumab plasma 
concentrations was also conducted. Based on the small number of subjects who were ADA positive 
after approaching steady-state (only observed in subjects from Subpopulation 2, plasma 
concentrations stabilized in these subjects by Week 14, therefore allowing some informative 
assessment), there was no clear intra–subject effect of ADAs on risankizumab exposure.

The summary of the incidence of ADA and NAb to risankizumab across the first 12 weeks (Week 0-12) 
in the Phase 2 Study M15-993 and Phase 3 induction studies, Studies M15-991 and M16-006, and across 
24 weeks in the Phase 3 induction studies (Studies M15-991 and M16-006) are presented in Table 6 and

Additionally, in subjects who received the proposed induction dose of 600 mg IV at Weeks 0, 4 and 8, 
followed by the proposed SC maintenance dose of 360 mg SC at Week 12 and Q8W thereafter up to 
Week 52, incidence of ADA and NAb to risankizumab was 3.4% (2/58) and 0% (0/58), respectively, over 
64 weeks of exposure. In all subjects who received any risankizumab dose during the induction period 
followed by risankizumab treatment during the maintenance period, incidence of ADA and Nab was 2.2% 
(7/325) and 0.3% (1/325), respectively, over up to 76 weeks of exposure. 
ADA incidence was also assessed in the pivotal phase 1 BE study (Table 9).

each group (Table 12).

Groups in Substudy 1 and Substudy 2 
Summary of Effect of Immunogenicity on Risankizumab Exposure 
Based  on  the  inter-subject  assessment  across  the  Phase  3  studies,  risankizumab  serum  trough 
concentrations  (central tendency  and  distribution)  were  comparable  between  subjects  who  were  ADA 
positive  and  those  who  were  ADA  negative.  Limited  data  available  for  the  intra-subject  assessment 
indicated that there was no clear intra-subject effect of ADAs on risankizumab exposures. 
Based on the population pharmacokinetic analyses, treatment-emergent ADAs did not show statistically 
significant effects on risankizumab clearance or exposure.

Effect of ADA status on Risankizumab safety 
Hypersensitivity reactions  
Among subjects who received the proposed induction regimen of 600 mg IV at Weeks 0, 4 and 8, in the 
All Treated Safety Analysis Set, the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions was numerically higher among 
treatment-emergent ADA  positive (2/26, 7.7%)  than the  ADA negative (34/651, 5.2%) subjects, but 
this observation should be interpreted with caution given the small number of treatment-emergent ADA 
positive subjects (26/677, 3.8%). Among subjects who received the proposed maintenance regimen of 
360 mg SC Q8W, in the All Treated Safety Analysis Set, the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions was 
numerically  higher  among  treatment-emergent  ADA  positive  (1/11,  9.1%)  than  the  ADA  negative 
(28/465, 6.0%) subjects, again based on the small number of treatment-emergent ADA positive subjects 
(11/476, 2.3%). All hypersensitivity reactions events in treatment emergent ADA positive subjects were 
mild or moderate in severity and none of these events led to treatment discontinuation with exception 
of one event. One treatment emergent ADA positive subject who received a single dose of the 200 mg 
IV  induction  regimen  in  Phase  2  Study  M15-993  experienced  a  non-serious  AE  of  moderate  infusion 
related  reaction  on  Day  1  that  led  to  study  drug  withdrawn.  Given  the  low  overall  hypersensitivity 
reaction rates, these differences are not clinically relevant. 
Injection and infusion site reactions  
Among subjects who received the proposed induction regimen of 600 mg IV at Weeks 0, 4 and 8, in the 
All Treated Safety Analysis Set, the incidence of injection site reactions (including infusion site reactions) 
was  numerically  higher  in  treatment-emergent  ADA  positive  subjects  (3.8%,  1/26)  than  the  ADA 
negative  (1.7%,  11/651)  subjects,  based  on  the  small  number  of  treatment-emergent  ADA  positive 
subjects (26/677, 3.8%). Among subjects who received the proposed maintenance regimen of 360 mg 
SC  Q8W,  the  incidence  of  injection  site  reactions  was  numerically higher  among treatment-emergent 
ADA positive (9.1%, 1/11) subjects than the ADA negative (5.2%, 24/465) subjects, based on the small 
number  of  treatment-emergent  ADA  positive  subjects  (11/476,  2.3%).  All  injection  and  infusion  site 
reactions  in  treatment-emergent  ADA  positive  subjects  were  mild  or  moderate  in  severity.  One  ADA 
positive subject experienced a moderate infusion related reaction that led to study drug discontinuation, 
as  described  above.  Given  the  low  overall  injection  site  reactions  rates,  these  differences  between 
treatment-emergent ADA positive and ADA negative subjects are not considered clinically relevant. 
Overall, these results indicate that immunogenicity to risankizumab had no clinically relevant impact on 
the safety of risankizumab as assessed by hypersensitivity reactions, injection and infusion site reactions. 
Effect of ADA status on Risankizumab efficacy 
The comparison of CDAI clinical remission, SF/APS clinical remission and endoscopic response endpoints 
at Week 12 by ADA and NAb status (positive or negative) using pooled data from the Phase 3 induction 
studies and comparison of CDAI clinical remission, SF/APS clinical remission and endoscopic response 
endpoints  at  Week  52  by  ADA  and  NAb  status  (positive  or  negative)  using  data  from  the  Phase  3 
maintenance study was presented. Response rates at the end of the 12-Week Induction Period and at 
Week 52 were largely comparable between subjects who were ADA positive and those who were ADA 
negative. The number of NAb positive subjects was too small to make a meaningful comparison with 
NAb negative subjects.

Special populations 
Impaired renal function 
In the population PK analysis, creatinine clearance was statistically correlated with risankizumab 
clearance. However, the impact on risankizumab exposures over the evaluated range for creatinine 
clearance (25-291 mL/min) was not clinically relevant. 
Impaired hepatic function 
In the population PK analysis, liver function markers aspartate aminotransferase, alanine 
aminotransferase and total bilirubin were not identified as statistically significant covariates. 
Gender 
In the population PK analysis, sex was identified as a statistically significant covariate on risankizumab 
clearance. However, the difference in risankizumab exposures between males and females was not 
clinically meaningful.

Race 
Study M16-533 
Study M16-533 was a Phase 1, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-center study 
designed to assess the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity following a single IV 
administration of risankizumab or placebo in healthy Japanese and Caucasian subjects. A total of 16 
subjects were randomized to risankizumab or placebo in a ratio of 6:2 in each group as follows: 
•  Group 1: Japanese 1800 mg IV 
•  Group 2: Caucasian 1800 mg IV 
The ratios and 90% confidence intervals of Cmax and AUC values of risankizumab in healthy Japanese 
subjects relative to healthy Caucasian subjects without adjusting for body weight differences (body 
weight was not found to be statistically significant when tested as a covariate) are presented in the 
CSR. 
These results indicate that following a single infusion of risankizumab 1800 mg IV, risankizumab 
exposures in Japanese subjects were similar to Caucasian subjects. Low titer treatment-emergent 
ADAs were detected in three subjects (1/6 [17%] in Japanese and 2/6 [33%] in Caucasian) in the 
study with no apparent impact on risankizumab exposure.  
Study M17-381 
Study M17-381 was a Phase 1, open-label, three-arm, single-centre study conducted in mainland 
China in healthy Chinese subjects. Subjects were enrolled and received the following doses of 
risankizumab: 
•  Arm 1: 1800 mg IV (N = 10) 
•  Arm 2: 360 mg SC (N = 10) 
•  Arm 3: 150 mg SC (N = 10) 
Following administration of a single SC dose of risankizumab 150 or 360 mg in healthy Chinese 
subjects, risankizumab serum concentrations peaked in approximately three days on average, with 
dose-dependent increase in exposure and a mean terminal t1/2 of approximately 29 days. 
Risankizumab exposures (AUC) were dose-proportional between the 150 and 360 mg SC doses. 
Following administration of the single 1800 mg IV dose, risankizumab serum concentrations declined in 
a biphasic manner with the terminal phase decline in parallel with the SC dosing arms and a mean t1/2 
of approximately 35 days. Following administration of single SC or IV doses of risankizumab, there was 
no incidence of treatment-emergent ADA across the three arms. 
Overall, race did not have an impact on risankizumab clearance. A cross-study comparison of non-
compartmental pharmacokinetic parameters in Chinese (Study M17-381), Japanese (Study M16-533), 
and Western (Studies M16-533 and M19-128) subjects also demonstrated similarity across the groups, 
indicating the lack of ethnic sensitivity. 
Population PK Analyses 
Race was not identified to be statistically correlated to risankizumab PK during the covariate search 
step of the model development process. To highlight the lack of impact of race on risankizumab PK, 
model predicted risankizumab exposures at the proposed clinical induction and maintenance dosing 
regimen in Asian subjects and non-Asian subjects are shown in Figure 5.

Weight 
Body weight was significantly correlated with risankizumab clearance and volume of distribution. 
However, over the evaluated range of body weights (32-159 kg), risankizumab exposures were 
estimated to be within the default equivalence boundaries of 0.8 to 1.25 relative to the reference 
group. 
Age 
The age of subjects included in the population PK analysis ranged between 16 and 79 years. There was 
limited information in subjects aged >65 years. Age was not identified as a significant covariate during 
the covariate search.  
Figure 6 shows the exposures in adolescents and adults. Figure 7 shows a comparison of the simulated 
exposures in adolescents and adults during the induction period and maintenance period.

2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Risankizumab is a humanised immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody that selectively binds 
with high affinity to the p19 subunit of human interleukin 23 (IL-23) cytokine without binding to IL12 
and inhibits its interaction with the IL-23 receptor complex. IL-23 is a cytokine that is involved in 
inflammatory and immune responses. By blocking IL-23 from binding to its receptor, risankizumab 
inhibits IL-23-dependent cell signalling and release of proinflammatory cytokines. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Consistent with the mechanism of action of inhibiting IL-23 p19 binding to its receptor and subsequent 
downstream  signaling,  treatment  with  risankizumab  down-modulated  genes  associated  with  the 
inflammatory response and the IL-23/T helper 17 axis in gut tissue of patients with CD in the Phase 2 
Study M15-993 (Visvanathan 2018). 
The IL-23 associated pharmacodynamic biomarker, IL-22, and the inflammatory biomarkers, hs-CRP and 
FCP, were evaluated in a subset of subjects with CD selected to reflect the response rate, demographics, 
and clinical characteristics of the  Phase 3 induction studies, Studies M15-991 (n = 122 subjects) and 
M16-006 (n = 123 subjects), and the maintenance study, Study M16-000 Sub-Study 1 (n = 92 subjects). 
In  Study  M15-991  and  Study  M16-006,  treatment  with  risankizumab  600  mg  IV  and  1200  mg  IV 
significantly  decreased  the  levels  of  IL-22  at  Week  12,  confirming  the  pharmacodynamic  effect  of 
risankizumab on the IL-23 pathway in patients with CD. 
Treatment with risankizumab 600 mg IV and 1200 mg IV also significantly decreased hs-CRP levels at 
Week  12,  confirming  the  anti-inflammatory  effect  of  risankizumab  in  patients  with  CD.  Additionally, 
treatment  with  risankizumab  600  mg  and  1200  mg  significantly  decreased  FCP  levels  at  Week  12  in 
Study M16-006 and elicited a similar trend of response at Week 12 in Study M15-991, confirming the 
anti-inflammatory effect of risankizumab in patients with CD. 
In Study M16-000 Sub-Study 1, treatment with risankizumab 180 mg SC and 360 mg SC in subjects 
with clinical response to IV risankizumab induction, continued to inhibit IL-22 levels and maintained the 
pharmacodynamic  effect  on  the  IL-23  pathway  to  a  similar  degree  at  Week  52.  The  robust 
pharmacodynamic  effect  elicited  after  12  weeks  of  induction  treatment  was  also  observed  in  the 
withdrawal (placebo SC) group at Week 52, where IL-22 levels remained below what was observed at 
baseline of induction.  
Finally, treatment with risankizumab 180 mg SC and 360 mg SC continued to inhibit hs-CRP and FCP 
levels and maintained the anti-inflammatory effect to a similar degree between doses at Week 52, which 
contrasts  with  increasing  levels  in  the  withdrawal  (placebo  SC)  subjects  at  Week  52  as  compared  to 
Week 0.

Exposure-response analyses for efficacy of risankizumab in subjects with active Crohn’s Disease  
Data from subjects with active CD in the Phase 2 Study M15-993 Period 1 (N = 121), Phase 3 
induction Studies M15-991 (N = 569) and M16-006 (N = 850), and Phase 3 maintenance Study M16-
000 Sub-study 1 (N = 462) who received placebo or at least one dose of risankizumab were included in 
the efficacy exposure-response analyses.

The relationships between the efficacy endpoints (Crohn's disease activity index [CDAI] clinical 
remission, CDAI clinical response, stool frequency [SF]/abdominal pain score [APS] clinical remission, 
SF/APS clinical response, endoscopic response, endoscopic remission, stool frequency remission, 
abdominal pain remission, and ulcer free endoscopy) and risankizumab exposures were evaluated at 
Week 12 (end of first 12-week Induction Period) and Week 52 (end of maintenance). Additionally, an 
exploratory exposure-response analysis was carried out for these endpoints at Week 24 (end of 
Induction Period 2). The relationships were investigated using graphical analyses (at the end of Weeks 
12, 24 and 52) and logistic regression analyses (at Weeks 12 and 52). 
The exposure metrics used for the analyses were derived using the empirical Bayesian estimates of the 
individual PK parameters based on the population PK analyses and the actual dosing history of each 
subject. Caverage was used as the primary exposure metric. 
Results 
12-week induction period 
Graphical analyses 
Exposure-response graphical analyses demonstrated that exposures associated with 600 mg 
risankizumab intravenous (IV) at Weeks 0, 4 and 8 as an induction regimen rendered favourable 
efficacy results compared to the 200 mg IV every 4 weeks (Q4W) regimen for the clinical endpoints 
evaluated in the Phase 2 Study M15-993.  
For CDAI and SF/APS endpoints, results overall showed an increasing trend in response with increasing 
risankizumab concentrations, without an apparent plateau of efficacy for CDAI response, SF/APS 
clinical response and SF/APS clinical remission as shown in Figure 8. For endoscopic endpoints, no 
conclusive exposure-response trends were observed, yet subjects treated with risankizumab showed 
favourable efficacy compared to placebo. Similar trends were seen when efficacy response rates were 
plotted against Ctrough, Week 12.

Results from the Phase 3 induction studies showed that subjects treated with risankizumab achieved 
higher response rates compared to placebo, but with no clear exposure-response trends in any of the 
evaluated efficacy endpoints (Figure 9). The suggested that 600 mg risankizumab IV at Weeks 0, 4 
and 8 as an induction regimen achieved near maximal efficacy, with no clear added benefit from the 
1200 mg IV at Weeks 0, 4, and 8 regimen.

Logistic Regression Analyses 
Model predictions for the response rates at Week 12 for the two regimens tested in Phase 3, 600 and 
1200 mg IV at Weeks 0, 4, and 8 are provided for the clinical and endoscopic endpoints in Table 16 
and Table 17, with the latter showing endpoints where Bio-IR as a stratification factor was statistically 
significant. 
Table 16 Model Predictions of Response Rates at Week 12 for Clinical Endpoints 
Table 17 Model Predictions of Response Rates at Week 12 for SF/APS Clinical Remission and 
Endoscopic Endpoints 
Of the covariates explored for their potential effects, the following covariates were found to be 
statistically significant (p < 0.001): Asian race for SF/APS clinical remission and stool frequency 
remission; duration of disease at baseline for stool frequency remission; baseline albumin levels for 
endoscopic endpoints (endoscopic response, endoscopic remission, and ulcer free endoscopy); baseline 
isolated ileitis for endoscopic response and abdominal pain remission. 
Based on the exposure-response models, an induction regimen of 1200 mg IV at Weeks 0, 4, and 8, 
was predicted to render about 1 – 5% higher response rates compared to the 600 mg IV dose level 
across the endpoints. A similar result was predicted for the covariate subgroups. 
Induction Period 2 (exploratory) 
Graphical analyses 
Overall results indicate that for the clinical endpoints, subjects who did not achieve clinical response at 
Week 12 and initiated maintenance therapy with 180 or 360 mg SC Q8W demonstrated similar efficacy 
as subjects who underwent re-induction with the 1200 mg IV Q4W regimen. For the endoscopic 
endpoints, patients in the higher quartiles (associated with the 360 mg SC Q8W and 1200 mg IV Q4W 
regimens) had higher response rates.

Maintenance period 
Graphical analysis 
Sub-study 1 of the 52-week maintenance period of the Phase 3 study evaluated two maintenance 
regimens of 180 mg and 360 mg SC Q8W in comparison with placebo. The graphical exposure-
response analyses showed trends of higher response rates in the higher range of exposures associated 
with the 360 mg SC Q8W regimen for most evaluated efficacy endpoints, particularly for difficult to 
treat endpoints, endoscopic remission and ulcer free endoscopy (Figure 10).

in maintenance Period (Study M16-000) 
Logistic regression analyses 
Model predictions for the response rates at Week 52 for the two maintenance regimens tested in Phase 
3, 180 and 360 mg SC Q8W, are provided for clinical endpoints and endoscopic endpoints in Table 18 
and Table 19, respectively, grouped by the statistically significant stratification factors. 
Table 18 Model Predictions of Response Rates at Week 52 Stratified by SF/APS Clinical Remission 
Table 19 Model Predictions of Response Rates at Week 52 Stratified by Endoscopic Response 
For the clinical endpoints (CDAI Response, CDAI Remission, SF/APS Clinical Response, SF/APS Clinical 
Remission, Abdominal Pain Remission, Stool Frequency Remission), the exposure-response models 
predicted that there was minimal difference in response rates with the 180 and 360 mg SC Q8W 
maintenance regimens. For the endoscopic endpoints (Endoscopic Response, Endoscopic Remission, 
and Ulcer free Endoscopy), the 360 mg SC Q8W regimen was predicted to result in 3-7% higher 
response rates compared to the 180 mg SC Q8W maintenance regimen (based on numerical 
differences in tabulated mean % response rates). 
Exposure-response analyses for safety of risankizumab in subjects with active Crohn’s Disease  
Data from subjects with active CD in the Phase 3 Induction Studies M15-991 (N = 605) and M16-006 
(N = 926), and Phase 3 maintenance Study M16-000 (N = 462) who received placebo or at least one 
dose of risankizumab were included in the safety exposure-response analyses. 
The proportions of subjects who experienced any of the key safety variables of interest (any adverse 
event [AE], any serious AE [SAE], any infection, and any serious infection) through Weeks 12 (end of 
the 12-Week Induction Period), Week 24 (end of Induction Period 2), and Week 52 (end of 
Maintenance Period) of the Phase 3 CD studies (Studies M15-991, M16-006, and M16-000 Sub-study

1), were determined among subjects who received placebo (Week 12 and Week 52) and in each 
observed risankizumab exposure quartile. Caverage and Cmax (maintenance period) were the 
exposure metrics used for these analyses. 
Results 
12-week induction period 
As shown in Figure 11, there was no apparent relationship between risankizumab exposures and any 
AE, SAE, infection or serious infection over the first 12 weeks. Overall, during the 12-week Induction 
Period (Weeks 0 – 12), the incidences of safety variables of interest were lower in the risankizumab 
treated subjects compared to the placebo-treated subjects.

2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Bioanalytical methods 
The  Method  for  determination  of  Risankizumab  serum  concentration  is  an  Electrochemiluminescence 
(ECL)  assay.  The  method  was  validated  at  both  analytical  sites  as  sample  analysis  for  Risankizumab 
concentrations in human serum  for the pivotal Phase  3 CD Studies was conducted  at  both  sites.  The 
method  has  been  suitably  validated  as  per  the  Guideline  on  bioanalytical  method  validation 
(EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009/Rev. 1).  
For the anti-drug antibody (ADA assay the overall approach to measuring immunogenicity is in line with 
the  recommendations  of  the  EMA  Guideline  on  Immunogenicity  assessment  of  therapeutic  proteins 
(EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/14327/2006  Rev  1)  and  the  EMA  Guideline  on  immunogenicity  assessment  of 
monoclonal antibodies intended for in vivo clinical use (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/86289/2010). A titre-based 
acid dissociation bridging Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunoassay was developed and indication 
specific cut points were established. The ADA assay was also validated at both analytical sites as testing

occurred at both sites. Cross validation is presented demonstrating comparability of the method at both 
sites.  
The MAH has provided an adequate method description and validation of the method used to evaluate 
neutralizing anti- Risankizumab (NAb) levels in human serum of healthy donors and CD patients. The 
method was validated as per the relevant  EMA  guidelines hence  acceptable. The NAb assay was also 
validated  at  both  analytical  sites  as  testing  occurred  at  both  sites.  Cross  validation  is  presented 
demonstrating comparability of the method at both sites. 
Population PK Analyses 
The methods used for model development and evaluation are deemed acceptable. Data exclusions 
were well documented and acceptable. The linear two-compartment model, with first-order absorption 
for SC administration, provided an adequate fit to the PK of risankizumab in subjects with CD. Final 
model parameters (fixed and random effects) were estimated with good precision (all %RSE <21%). 
The computed η-shrinkage for CL was reasonably low (12.6%), whilst η-shrinkages for Vc and Ka were 
relatively high (44% and 59%, respectively). As such, individual EBEs for AUC and hence Caverage, 
which was used as the primary exposure metric in the exposure-response analyses, can be considered 
reliable. On the other hand, individual EBEs for Cmax, an appropriate exposure metric for exposure-
safety analyses, would be considered less reliable (see Exposure-Safety analyses for further 
discussion). The goodness-of-fit plots showed that the final model described the data well. The VPCs 
showed that the prediction performance of the final model was acceptable. 
Age, race and body weight did not show a clinically relevant effect on risankizumab PK. When 
evaluated in terms of AUC, the impact of low serum albumin on risankizumab exposure is unlikely to 
be of clinical relevance. No other covariates tested showed a clinically meaningful impact on 
risankizumab PK. Thus, from a PK perspective, a dose adjustment of risankizumab does not appear to 
be warranted in terms of the identified covariates in adolescent (aged ≥16 years) and adult patients 
with CD. 
Bioavailability 
Study  M16-324  was  a  phase  I  development  study  which  examined  the  PK  and  immunogenicity  of 
Rizankizumab  following  administration  of  either:  Three  SC  injections  of  0.8  mL  each  (216  mg; 
Reference);  2.4  mL  administered  SC  using  a  syringe  pump  over  3  minutes  (216  mg;  Test);  2.4  mL 
administered SC using a syringe pump over 6 minutes (216 mg; Test); or one SC injection of 2 mL (180 
mg; Test). In general, PK parameters were reasonably comparable between these differing methods of 
administration. A slightly higher exposure relative to reference (in terms of AUCt/AUCinf) was evident in 
group 2 (administered 216 mg SC over 3 minutes). Treatment emergent ADA incidence ranged from 0-
50% and was highest (50 %) in group 3 (administered 216 mg SC over 6 minutes). Although this is a 
high incidence relative to the rest of the clinical development programme, the numbers in each group of 
this study were low (50% represents 6/12 in that group). Furthermore, the method of administration 
and  dose  used  in  this  study  is  not  representative  of  the  proposed to  be  marketed  device.  Therefore, 
querying this high ADA incidence is not considered unlikely to add significantly to the clinical benefit risk 
assessment of Risankizumab at this time. ADA incidence did not appear to have a significant effect of 
Risankizumab exposures. 
Bioequivalence 
Study M19-128 was a phase I single-dose, open label bioequivalence study in healthy volunteers. The 
study was split into two sub-studies. The first aimed to bridge the on-body delivery system (OBDS - a 
medical device which controls an SC administration of 360 mg of Risankizumab in 2.4 ml of a 150 mg/ml 
formulation over approximately 5 minutes to be used in the maintenance phase) proposed for marketing 
to the pre-filled syringe (PFS) presentation (90 mg/ml administered as four 1 ml SC injections) as used 
CHMP assessment report on group of extensions of marketing authorisation  
EMA/887275/2022  
Page 64/258 
 
 
 
 
in the pivotal phase 3 maintenance study (M16-000). The second sub-study aimed to assess the relative 
bioavailability of risankizumab following IV administration of the to be marketed 600 mg liquid vial versus 
the 300 mg liquid vial used in the pivotal phase III studies (M15-991 and M16-006).  
The  MAH 
received 
scientific 
advice 
of 
the 
design 
of 
this 
study 
from  CHMP 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/591772/2019)  including  separate  questions  on  the  design of  the  2  sub-studies.  It 
should be noted that only limited data was presented at the time of the SA submission, but the proposed 
design was endorsed by CHMP. Furthermore, the proposed product design approach (i.e. the PK bridging 
exercise, with no direct clinical evaluation of the OBDS device) was also endorsed. 
In  general,  the  study  appears  to  have  been  appropriately  designed  in  line  with  the  relevant  EMA 
guidance. Of note, there were a number of OBDS related dosage failures in sub-study 1 (this occurred 
in 11 subjects who were excluded from the PK analysis set). However, the MAH adequately justified that 
the findings do not raise a concern for the efficacy or safety of the OBDS. Interim results of a currently 
ongoing RLHS, using the updated IFU, suggest a relatively low rate of dosing failures (2.7%) for OBDS 
self-administration. In all three dosing failure cases, the OBDS performed as intended and notified the 
subject of the error so that each subject received their dose with a replacement device. It is agreed that 
the interim results do not suggest any unanticipated clinical concerns or harms associated with the use 
of the OBDS. Finally, the risk mitigation measures implemented by the MAH are considered acceptable. 
In sub-study 1, the point estimate for the LS mean ratios of serum rizankizumb (360 mg OBDS/4 × 90 
mg/mL PFS) and associated 90% CI of Cmax, AUC 0-t and AUC 0-∞ were 1.263 [1.184, 1.347]; 1.065 
[1.001, 1.164] and 1.070 [1.01, 1.134]. Bioequivalence in terms of AUC 0-t and AUC 0-∞ between the 
two presentations was demonstrated. Bioequivalence in terms of Cmax was not demonstrated. The MAH 
contends that the observed difference in terms of Cmax is not clinically relevant based of tolerability at 
higher exposures observed during the IV induction phase at doses of up to 1800 mg and 1200 mg in 
healthy and CD patients, respectively. In addition, there was no trend of increased adverse events with 
increasing  exposure  and  there  were  no  clinical  consequences  of  treatment-emergent  ADAs.  This  is 
considered sufficient to rule out potential safety implications of the slightly higher Cmax with the OBDS 
during the maintenance phase. Therefore, the lack of formal bioequivalence of Cmax between OBDS and 
PFS can be accepted based on the totality of PK and PK/PD information.  
For the 180 mg OBDS formulation, the MAH examined for bioequivalence between the 360 mg and the 
180 mg OBDS presentations, rather than as a 3 way bioequivalence with the 90 mg/ml PFS which would 
have been a more direct comparison. However, as the 180 mg OBDS presentation is not proposed for 
marketing this is not being raised at this time. Bioequivalence between the 180 mg and 360 mg OBDS 
presentations in terms of Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ was demonstrated.  
The dose chosen in substudy 2 (1800 mg) IV is higher than that used in the phase II induction studies 
(mx dose of 1200 mg IV used in both M15-991 and M16-006) and the 600 mg IV induction dose 
proposed for marketing. Dose proportional increases in rizankizumab exposures following IV 
administration have previously demonstrated and therefore this is considered acceptable. The point 
estimate for the LS mean ratios of serum rizankizumb (600 mg vial/300 mg vial) and associated 90% 
CI of Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ were 0.998 [0.952, 1.046]; 1.079 [1.001, 1.164] and 1.044 [0.976, 
1.117]. Bioequivalence in terms of Cmax, AUCt and AUC∞ between the two formulations was 
demonstrated. 
PK in target population 
Study M15-993 is a dose ranging phase 2 study evaluating risankizumab in patients with moderate to 
severe active CD, compared with placebo. While the main objectives were efficacy and safety, (see 
further sections of the AR below), PK Ctrough levels were collected. Ctrough levels of Rizankizumab for 
the proposed induction dose of IV 600mg ranged between 31.5 and 35.5 μg/mL across period 1 
CHMP assessment report on group of extensions of marketing authorisation  
EMA/887275/2022  
Page 65/258 
 
 
 
 
(weeks 8 -12) and 2 (weeks 22-26) and are comparable to the figure quoted in the SmPC 
(38.8 µg/mL). For the maintenance dose tested in this study, SC 180mg Rizankizumab Ctrough levels 
ranged between 3.6 and 4.4 μg/mL in period 3 (weeks 42 – 50). This is roughly dose proportional to 
the 360mg Ctrough figure quoted in the SmPC of 8.13 ug/mL. Treatment-emergent ADA-positive 
responses were observed in 8% of the subjects who received at least one dose of risankizumab.  
Ctrough concentrations were also comparable for the OLE extension study M15-989, and ranged from 
3.22 μg/mL to 4.22 μg/mL following SC 180 mg once steady state had been reached (week 24). ADAs 
were observed in 12% of subjects who received at least one dose of risankizumab during the study. 
Ctrough plasma concentrations of risankizumab in ADA-positive patients appeared lower than in ADA-
negative patients, however overall PK plasma concentrations were largely influenced by a single 
patient in which Risankizumab exposure appeared to be impacted by the development of ADA.  
Overall, the number of patients involved is too small to draw any conclusion from the impact of ADAs 
on plasma concentrations of risankizumab. 
Immunogenicity 
In general, treatment emergent ADA incidence was low across the CD clinical development programme 
and ranged from 0-5% across all studies. A notable exception to this was ADA incidence in the pivotal 
phase  I  bioequivalence  study  which  assessed the  BE  of  the  to  be  marketed on  body  delivery  system 
(OBDS) in which treatment emergent ADA incidence of up to 13 % were observed. However,  the MAH 
showed that, while a higher anti-drug antibody (ADA) incidence was observed in the 360 mg OBDS group 
(13%) compared to the 90 mg/mL PFS group (6%), the treatment-emergent ADA incidences across all 
groups  were  within  the  range  observed  in  previous Phase  1  single  dose  studies.  There  were  minimal 
differences in risankizumab exposure between ADA-positive and ADA-negative groups and ADAs had no 
impact on immune-related safety events. Therefore, it is agreed that the higher ADA incidence for OBDS 
vs PFS observed in Study M19-128 is unlikely to result in clinically meaningful consequences for safety. 
ADA positivity was consistently associated with a small numerical decrease in mean serum trough levels 
in the IV administration induction studies, however, such sub-group difference were small and variable. 
It is accepted these are unlikely to be of any clinical relevance. In phase 3 maintenance study (M16-
000), only one subject in the 360 mg SC Q8W arm tested positive for ADA (at week 48), this subject 
displayed approximately 50 % of the mean serum trough levels in the ADA negative subjects at this time 
point group. It is noted that in this subject, the ratio of steady state trough serum concentrations after 
versus  before  ADA  detection  was  equal  to  0.98,  suggesting  no  significant  effect  of  ADA  of  PK  in  this 
individual.  Furthermore,  it  is  noted  that  ADA  or  NAb  status  did  not  have  a  significant  effect  on 
risankizumab exposure based on the population pharmacokinetic analyses. PopPK analyses did not reveal 
a significant effect of ADA status on clearance. A comparison of AEs with the PTs of injection site reactions 
and hypersensitivity reaction did not reveal any significant relationship to ADA status. Although incidence 
of hypersensitivity reactions was higher in the treatment emergent ADA positive sub groups, given the 
low incidence, no causal association can be inferred. Similarly, although minor differences in terms of 
efficacy assessments were observed between subgroups, such differences were minor and given the low 
incidence a causal association cannot be drawn. In general, it is accepted that ADA incidence did not 
appear to exhibit a significant effect on risankizumab exposure, safety or efficacy in the pivotal studies 
in the CD clinical development programme.  
Special populations 
Overall, a dose-adjustment of risankizumab is not deemed necessary in terms of special populations in 
subjects with CD aged 16 years and over.

The MAH presents study M16-533 comparing a single IV dose of 1800 mg Rizankizumab in Japanese 
and Caucasian healthy volunteers. In general, PK data indicated similar Cmax, AUCt and AUCinf 
parameters in both races. ADA incidence did not appear to have a significant effect of Rizankizumab 
exposures. 
The MAH also presents study M17-381 comparing a single dose of IV 1800 mg, SC 360 mg and SC 150 
mg Rizankizumab in Chinese healthy volunteers. Risankizumab exposures (AUC) appeared dose-
proportional between the 150 and 360 mg SC doses. There were no treatment emergent ADAs in these 
trial subjects.   
Pharmacodynamics 
Primary Pharmacology 
In phase III induction studies M15-991 and M16-006 risankizumab treatment at 600 mg and 1200 mg 
was associated with a reduction in serum CRP, FCP and IL-22 levels. These changes were maintained 
following maintenance therapy at 180 mg and 360 mg in study M16-000. It should be noted that not all 
such  changes  were  statistically  significant  or  dose  proportional.  In  general,  the  submitted  PD  data 
support the proposed mechanism of action and efficacy in the proposed patient population. 
Exposure-response analyses for efficacy 
Induction period 
Graphical quartile analyses based on the Phase 3 studies suggested that exposures associated with the 
600 mg induction regimen achieved near maximal efficacy for all endpoints evaluated, with no 
additional benefit observed for the 1200 mg regimen. 
The logistic regression models described the exposure-response relationships for efficacy adequately. 
In line with the graphical analyses, model predictions suggested that the 600 mg induction regimen 
achieves near maximal efficacy across all efficacy endpoints. However, a small added benefit of 1-5% 
was predicted for the 1200 mg induction regimen. 
Induction period 2 
For subjects who did not achieve a clinical response at Week 12 and entered an exploratory, 12-week 
double-blinded re-induction period, graphical quartile analyses suggested that initiation of maintenance 
therapy with 180 or 360 mg SC Q8W at Week 12 resulted in similar response rates as re-induction with 
a 1200 mg IV Q4W regimen across all efficacy endpoints evaluated at Week 24. 
Maintenance 
Graphical quartile analyses at Week 52 showed trends of higher response in the higher range of 
exposures associated with the 360 mg SC Q8W regimen for most of the evaluated efficacy endpoints, 
particularly for the more stringent endoscopic endpoints such as endoscopic remission and ulcer free 
endoscopy.  
The logistic regression models described the exposure-response relationships adequately. Model 
predictions at Week 52 suggested that response rates for endoscopic endpoints are about 3-7% higher 
with the 360 mg SC Q8W maintenance regimen vs the 180 mg Q8W regimen. 
Overall, the results of the exposure response analyses for efficacy, provide support for the proposed 
clinical dosing regimen of risankizumab for subjects with moderately to severely active CD; an 
induction regimen of 600 mg IV at Weeks 0, 4 and 8, followed by a maintenance regimen of 360 mg 
SC Q8W.  
Exposure-response analyses for safety 
CHMP assessment report on group of extensions of marketing authorisation  
EMA/887275/2022  
Page 67/258 
 
 
 
 
The exposure-response analyses for safety did not identify any apparent relationship between 
risankizumab Cavg and safety events during either induction or maintenance treatment periods. There 
was also no apparent relationship between risankizumab Cmax at steady-state and any safety event 
over 52 weeks of the Maintenance Period.   
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The Clinical pharmacology has been well characterised and is acceptable.  
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The MAH submitted 2 Phase II studies (M15-993, M15-989) and 3 Phase III studies (M15-991, M16-
006, M16-000) in this application. Only M16-000 Sub-Study 1 was included in this assessment; Sub-
Study 2 and Sub-Study 3 are ongoing and results were not included in the submission. 
The MAH stated that, to meet regional regulatory requirements, each pivotal study was associated with 
two protocols - a United States (US) protocol and a protocol for outside the US (OUS). These protocols 
were identical in study design and analysed in the same population; specified co-primary and key 
secondary endpoints were different. 
The MAH stated that study-specific SAPs were finalized prior to unblinding the studies.

This was a proof-of-concept, double-blind, dose-ranging study of RZB in subjects with moderately to 
severely active CD. A screening period of up to 4 weeks was followed by Period 1 (12-week blinded IV 
period), Period 2 (14-week open-label (OL) IV/wash-out period), Period 3 (26-week SC period) and 
follow up (15 weeks).   
Inclusion and exclusion criteria allowed for subjects with a diagnosis of moderately to severely active 
CD.  Allowable concomitant medications were pre-specified; corticosteroids (CS) must have been 
discontinued at least 3 weeks prior to the study. 
Up to 120 eligible patients were to be randomised 1:1:1 in to parallel treatment arms in Period 1, 
stratified according to previous experience with anti-TNF therapy (naïve vs. experienced). PBO and 
RZB infusions were matched to maintain blinding. 
Treatments 
Period 1: PBO vs. RZB 600 mg IV vs. RZB 200mg IV (3 infusions; weeks 0, 4, 8) (blinded) 
Period 2: RZB 600 mg IV (3 infusions; 4 weeks apart) or washout (open label) 
Period 3: RZB 180 mg SC (4 doses; 8 weeks apart) or RZB stopped (open label) 
Analysis set 
The primary efficacy endpoint was clinical remission, defined as a CDAI < 150, at Week 12. 
The Period 1 Full Analysis Set (FAS-P1) population included all randomized subjects who had taken at 
least one dose of study drug in the double-blind IV period; subjects were assessed according to 
assigned treatment at randomization. Statistical tests were 2-sided, at a significance level of α = 0.10, 
with no adjustment for multiple comparisons. A stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test with 
randomisation factor of naïve or experienced to TNF antagonists as the stratification variable was used 
for the binary primary endpoint 
Results 
In total, 121 subjects were enrolled, 74 females and 47 males.  Mean age was 38.1 years. 
Demographic characteristics were balanced with regard to sex, age, race, ethnicity, weight, and 
country of origin. Average duration of CD was 13.4 years.  Most subjects (67.8%) had at least 1 CD-
specific therapy within 90 days prior to participation in the study (40.5% IMM therapy; 33.1% CSs; 
17.4% ASAs.  Almost all subjects (114/121; 94.2%) had received previous anti-TNF therapy. 
Of 121 subjects enrolled, 89% (108/121) completed Period 1.  Among 13 subjects who discontinued in 
Period 1, the most common reason was due to ‘AE’ (PBO: 6; RZB 200 mg: 5; RZB 600 mg: 1). 
Protocol violations (n=3) were not considered to have affected study outcome or interpretation of 
study results.

At week 12, the RZB 600 mg IV group demonstrated a statistically significantly greater difference in 
the proportion of subjects achieving CDAI clinical remission versus PBO (remission rate RZB 600 mg IV 
36.6% vs. PBO 15.4%; difference 20.9% (95% CI 2.6 – 39.2), p=0.0252). 
The RZB 200 mg IV group demonstrated a non-statistically significant, higher proportion achieving 
CDAI clinical remission compared to PBO (remission rate difference 4.1% (95% CI -12.4, 20.6), 
p=0.6278). 
With regard to secondary endpoints, deep remission, defined as CDAI <150 and CDEIS ≤ 4 (≤ 2 for 
patients with isolated ileal disease), confirmed by central independent reviewer, was achieved at Week 
12 by 0/39 (0 %), 1/41 (2.4%) and 5/41 (12.2%) patients in the PBO, 200 and 600 mg RZB IV 
groups, respectively (FAS-NRI).   
In Period 1, approximate dose-proportional increases in RZB plasma trough concentrations were 
observed in subjects who received RZB IV.  With RZB 180 mg SC dose Q8w starting at Week 26, near 
steady state levels were achieved by Week 42. 
After 26 weeks of 180 mg SC q8w maintenance therapy, of subjects who achieved clinical remission to 
RZB induction treatment, approximately 30% lost clinical remission and a majority did not achieve the 
stringent endpoints of endoscopic remission or deep remission.   
Treatment-emergent ADA-positive responses were low (8%) and the majority transient, appearing 
from 12 to 18 weeks post first treatment. No ADA-positive subjects became positive for nAb during the 
study and RZB plasm concentrations appeared unaffected.  
No new safety concerns or dose-dependent increase in AEs were observed.   
The results indicate a dose dependent response, supporting the higher RZB dose (600 mg) for 
induction and at least a dose of RZB 180 mg SC for maintenance of effect. However, an upper dose-
response limit, for induction or maintenance, is not deduced.

M15-989 was terminated early by the sponsor so that subjects could roll over into Phase 3 Study M16-
000 Sub-study 3 OLE, which is ongoing.   Efficacy endpoints (observed data "by visit" time points) 
showed that trends in response rate for clinical remission (CDAI < 150) and endoscopic remission 
(CDEIS ≤ 4 or CDEIS ≤ 2 for patients with initial isolated ileitis) were sustained throughout the study.  
No new safety signals were identified. On administration of RZB 180 mg SC q8w, steady-state plasma 
exposures were reached by Week 24 after the first SC dose.  Median trough concentrations ranged 
from 3.66-4.23 μg/mL.  Emergence of ADA was low and of no apparent impact on RZB concentrations. 
The descriptive results presented are supportive of the efficacy and safety of at least RZB 180 mg SC 
as a long-term treatment in patients with moderately to severely active CD, who showed a clinical 
response, or remission on previous treatment with RZB.

Induction Studies M15-991 and M16-006 
M15-991 - A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled induction study to assess the 
efficacy and safety of risankizumab in subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease who 
failed prior biologic treatment 
M16-006 –A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo Controlled Induction Study of the Efficacy 
and Safety of Risankizumab in Subjects with Moderately to Severely Active Crohn's Disease 
Methods 
The Phase 3 induction studies (Study M15-991 and Study M16-006) were multicenter, randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluations of risankizumab (risankizumab 600 mg IV or 1200 mg IV 
at Weeks 0, 4, and 8) in subjects 16 years and older with moderately to severely active CD defined as:  
• 
• 
a CDAI of 220 to 450,  
a daily average stool frequency (SF) of ≥ 4 and/or average daily abdominal pain score (APS) 
≥2,  
• 
and a Simple Endoscopic Score (SES) – CD (excluding the narrowing component) of ≥ 6, or ≥ 
4 for isolated ileal disease, confirmed by central review (known as original SES-CD).  
Of note, with global protocol Amendment 5 for Study M15-991 and global protocol Amendment 4 for 
Study M16-006, subjects with a lower SES-CD were also enrolled and capped at 10% of the total 
population of each study. Lower SES-CD was defined as a SES-CD of 3 to 5 for colonic or ileocolonic 
disease or a 3 for isolated ileal disease. Enrollment of subjects with lower SES-CD was undertaken to 
explore efficacy and safety of risankizumab in subjects with confirmed active moderate to severe 
clinical symptoms and a lesser degree of active endoscopic disease. 
Study Participants 
Study M15-991 was designed to enroll approximately 579 subjects who had a documented inadequate 
response or intolerance to use of an approved biologic agent (Bio-IR), such as infliximab, adalimumab, 
certolizumab, natalizumab, ustekinumab and/or vedolizumab.  
Study M16-006 was designed to enroll approximately 855 subjects who were Bio-IR or subjects who 
were Non-Bio-IR. The non-bio-IR population included subjects who had an IR or intolerance to 
conventional therapy, but not biologic therapy. Conventional therapy was defined as one or more of 
the following: aminosalicylates, oral locally acting steroids (e.g., budesonide, beclomethasone), 
systemic corticosteroids (prednisone or equivalent), or immunomodulators. This population also 
included subjects who received biologic therapy in the past but stopped therapy based on reasons 
other than IR or intolerance (e.g., change in reimbursement coverage, well-controlled disease). In 
CHMP assessment report on group of extensions of marketing authorisation  
EMA/887275/2022  
Page 73/258 
 
 
 
 
 
each study the number of subjects with prior exposure to ustekinumab was capped at 20% of the total 
population. 
Each induction study duration was estimated to be up to 49 weeks, including a Screening period of 35 
days, a 12-week induction period, a 12-week Induction Period 2 for subjects who did not achieve 
clinical response at Week 12, and a 140-day follow-up period from the last dose of study drug. 
At the Baseline visit, subjects who met all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria were 
enrolled into the double-blind 12-Week Induction Period and randomized to receive either 
risankizumab 600 mg IV, risankizumab 1200 mg IV, or placebo IV q4w for 3 doses. The randomization 
at Baseline was stratified by the number of prior biologics failed, steroid use at Baseline, and Baseline 
SES-CD (original versus lower). The 12-Week Induction Period was the pivotal portion of the study 
design.  
At Week 12, subjects who did not achieve SF/APS clinical response, defined as a ≥ 30% decrease in 
average daily SF and/or ≥ 30% decrease in average daily APS and both not worse than Baseline of the 
induction study, were eligible to enter Induction Period 2, a double-blind, double-dummy 12-week 
treatment period. Subjects who received IV risankizumab during the 12-week induction period were 
randomized 1:1:1 to either risankizumab 1200 mg IV, risankizumab 180 mg SC, or risankizumab 360 
mg SC. Subjects who received IV placebo induction treatment received risankizumab 1200 mg IV. The 
risankizumab IV dose or matching placebo IV was given at Weeks 12, 16, and 20. The risankizumab 
SC dose or matching placebo SC was given at Weeks 12 and 20. 
Subjects who achieved clinical response at Week 12 or Week 24 were eligible to enter Study M16-000. 
Subjects without clinical response at Week 24, as well as all subjects who terminated the study early 
(including subjects who were eligible for but did not participate in the blinded Induction Period 2), were 
discontinued and had a follow-up call 140 days from the last dose of study drug to obtain information 
on any new and/or ongoing adverse events (AE). 
Initiation of, increase in dose, or decrease in dose of concomitant CD-medications (i.e., 
aminosalicylates, oral locally acting steroids, systemic corticosteroids, or immunomodulators) was 
prohibited during the 12-Week Induction Period. Subjects who initiated new or exceeded their baseline 
dose of corticosteroids were imputed as non-responders for the co-primary endpoints.

Sample size  
Sample size calculation was based on the larger sample size needed to detect treatment differences 
between the risankizumab treatment arms and the placebo arm for each of the co-primary endpoints. 
Assuming the clinical remission (SF/APS) rate at Week 12 would be 23.5% for one of the risankizumab 
treatment arms and 10% for the placebo arm, a sample size of 193 subjects for each risankizumab 
arm and 193 for the placebo arm would have approximately 89% power to detect the treatment 
difference between risankizumab and placebo using a Fisher's exact test at alpha level of 0.025 (two-
sided). Assuming the CDAI clinical remission rate at Week 12 would be 34% for one of the 
risankizumab treatment arms and 15% for the placebo arm, this sample size would have 97% power 
to detect the treatment difference between risankizumab and placebo using a Fisher's exact test at a 
0.025 significant level (two-sided). Assuming the endoscopic response rate at Week 12 will be 17% for 
one of the risankizumab treatment arms and 5% for the placebo arm, this sample size would have

93% power to detect treatment difference between risankizumab and placebo using a Fisher's exact 
test at a 0.025 significant level (two-sided). Further details on sample size calculation is presented in 
the Protocol and SAP. 
Randomisation 
At baseline, eligible patients were randomized to three parallel groups with 1200 mg IV and 600 mg IV 
dose of risankizumab treatments or placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio. The 12-Week Induction Period 
randomization were stratified by number of prior biologics failed (1, > 1), baseline steroid use (Yes, 
No), and baseline eligible SES-CD (original, alternative), where the stratum of "original" includes the 
patients with baseline eligible SES-CD of ≥ 6 (or ≥ 4 for subjects with isolated ileal disease), and the 
stratum of "alternative" includes the patients with baseline eligible SES-CD of ≥ 3 to < 6 for ileocolonic 
or colonic disease or SES-CD of 3 for isolated ileal disease.  
Subjects with clinical non-response to risankizumab at Week 12 were to be re-randomized in a 1:1:1 
ratio to risankizumab 1200 mg IV dose group, risankizumab 360 mg SC dose group, or risankizumab 
180 mg SC dose group in the Induction Period 2. Subjects with clinical non-response to placebo at 
Week 12 blindly received risankizumab 1200 mg IV dose. No stratification was made for the Induction 
Period 2 randomization. 
Blinding (masking) 
It is unclear whether or not participants, those administering interventions and those assessing 
outcomes were aware of group assignment and if not, how the success of masking was assessed. 
Statistical methods 
A statistical analysis plan (SAP) was written and signed off prior to data base lock which included a 
number of amendments. These amendments are unlikely to have influenced the analyses outcomes for 
the primary outcome as far as can be ascertained.  
The primary hypotheses for the co-primary endpoint were stated as: 
(i) 
The proportion of subjects achieving clinical remission treated with risakizumab is 
greater than that treated with placebo at Week 12  
(ii) 
The proportion of subjects achieving endoscopic response treated with risakizumab is 
greater than that treated with placebo at Week 12 
The estimands corresponding to the primary efficacy objective for global protocol outside US were 
stated to have been defined mainly as a definition of the outcome. Intercurrent events were specified 
as: 1) premature discontinuation of study drug and 2) initiation or dose escalation of CD-related 
corticosteroids. 
Several analyses populations were defined, with the key one for the purposes of this assessment being 
the Intent-to-Treat Population (ITT) that included subjects who received at least one dose of study 
drug; for the 12-Week Induction Period, ITT1 was defined as randomized subjects who received at 
least one dose of study drug during the 12-Week Induction Period. 
For the primary outcome, the Cochran Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test adjusting for stratification factors 
was used. If there was a stratum for a treatment group that had no subjects in it, a value of 0.1 was 
used.  
Point estimates and 95% confidence interval (CI)s for the difference in proportions between each of 
risankizumab treatment groups and placebo were be provided. Construction of CI for the common risk 
difference was based on the Mantel-Haenszel estimate adjusting for stratification factors.

For analysis of continuous Variables a Mixed-Effect Model Repeated Measurement (MMRM) model was 
used. A hierarchical Multiplicity approach was adopted that split the initial 5% alpha to each of the two 
doses (testing each dose at 2.5% level) and then sequentially testing secondary endpoints, after both 
co-primary endpoints were rejected. A sequential testing approach thereafter was adopted until the 
last 10 secondary endpoints were reached after which a Bonferroni-Holm procedure was adopted.

Study Populations 
The ITT population for the 12-Week Induction Period (denoted as ITT1) included randomized subjects 
who received at least 1 dose of study drug during this period. 
• 
ITT1A: includes the subjects with a baseline eligible SES-CD of ≥ 6 (≥ 4 for isolated ileal 
disease); the primary population for efficacy analysis. N = 569 (191 subjects in the 
risankizumab 600 mg arm, 191 subjects in the risankizumab 1200 mg arm, and 187 subjects 
in the placebo arm). 
• 
ITT1B: includes the subjects who are not included in ITT1A because they did not have baseline 
eligible SES-CD of ≥ 6 (≥ 4 for isolated ileal disease). These subjects had a lower baseline 
eligible SES-CD and were used for exploratory efficacy analyses. N = 36 (11 subjects in the 
risankizumab 600 mg arm, 10 subjects in the risankizumab 1200 mg arm, and 15 subjects in 
the placebo arm). 
Thirteen subjects from a non-compliant site were excluded from the efficacy analyses for the 12-Week 
Induction Period (12 subjects excluded from ITT1A: 4 subjects in the risankizumab 600 mg IV arm, 3 
subjects in the risankizumab 1200 mg IV arm, and 5 subjects in the placebo arm; 1 subject in the 
risankizumab 1200 mg IV arm excluded from ITT1B). 
Induction Period 2 
The ITT population for the Induction Period 2 (denoted as ITT2) includes subjects who were 
randomized and received at least 1 dose of risankizumab during the Induction Period 2, and the 
subjects who received placebo induction treatment during 12-Week Induction Period and entered the 
Induction Period 2 (denoted as placebo/risankizumab). 
The placebo/risankizumab subjects were analyzed as a separate treatment group in the Induction 
Period 2. 
CHMP assessment report on group of extensions of marketing authorisation  
EMA/887275/2022  
Page 80/258 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
ITT2A: includes subjects who had baseline eligible SES-CD of ≥ 6 (≥ 4 for isolated ileal 
disease). N =196 (39 in the risankizumab 180 mg SC arm, 41 subjects in the risankizumab 
360 mg SC arm, 37 subjects in the risankizumab 1200 mg IV arm, and 79 subjects in the 
placebo IV/risankizumab arm). 
• 
ITT2B: includes the subjects who did not have baseline eligible SES-CD of ≥ 6 (≥ 4 for isolated 
ileal disease). These subjects had a lower baseline eligible SES-CD and were used for 
exploratory efficacy analysis. N = 13 (1 subject in the risankizumab 180 mg SC arm, 1 subject 
in the risankizumab 360 mg SC arm, 5 subjects in the risankizumab 1200 mg IV arm, and 6 
subjects in the placebo IV/risankizumab arm). 
Two subjects from a non-compliant site were excluded from the efficacy analyses for Induction Period 
2 (excluded from ITT2A: 1 subject in the risankizumab 180 mg SC arm and 1 subject in the placebo 
IV/risankizumab arm).  
For the corresponding ITT populations, subjects were assigned to a treatment group based on the 
randomization or re-randomization schedule, regardless of the treatment actually received. The 
demographics/baseline and efficacy analyses were based on the corresponding ITT population. 
Disposition of Subjects 
A total of 618 subjects were randomized in the study and received at least 1 dose of study drug.  
During the first 12-week induction period, a higher percentage of subjects in the risankizumab 600 mg 
and risankizumab 1200 mg treatment arms compared to placebo completed study drug. The most 
frequent primary reason for discontinuation of study drug in all treatment arms was AE, and the 
number of subjects who discontinued study drug due to AE was numerically higher in the placebo arm 
compared to either risankizumab arm. The most frequently reported AE that led to discontinuation of 
study drug was Crohn's disease (1 subject in the risankizumab 600 mg arm, 1 subject in the 
risankizumab 1200 mg arm, and 13 subjects in the placebo arm), suggesting a lack of efficacy of study 
drug in these subjects. Subject final status and reasons for discontinuation during the first 12-Week 
induction period are shown in Table 22.

Period (SA1 Population) 
Protocol Deviations 
Protocol deviations were collected for all subjects in the 12-Week Induction Period and Induction Period 
2 and are presented for the subjects in ITT1A. Protocol deviations were defined in accordance with the 
ICH guidelines and included, but were not limited to, the following: inclusion/exclusion criteria violation 
(49 [8.6%] total subjects), receipt of wrong treatment or incorrect dose of study drug (2 [0.4%] total 
subjects), development of withdrawal criteria without being withdrawn (no subjects) and use of 
prohibited concomitant medications (21 [3.7%] total subjects). 
Deviations were assessed for their impact on analyses and data integrity or subject safety. 
Efficacy data for subjects enrolled at an investigational site with significant noncompliance were 
excluded from the statistical analyses. Otherwise, reported protocol deviations did not have an impact 
on analyses and data integrity.

Baseline data 
12 – Week Induction Period 
Key baseline demographics were generally balanced between the three treatment groups (Table 23). 
Overall, the majority of subjects were white, not Hispanic or Latino, were between the ages of 18 and 
< 40, were of normal weight according to body mass index (BMI).

Use of any prior Crohn's disease related medication was reported by 100% of subjects.  The most 
frequently reported prior CD-related medications used by the treatment groups were adalimumab 
(71.4% of subjects) and infliximab (65.2% of subjects). Use of prior CD-related biologics/small 
molecules, immunomodulators (IMMs), steroids, and aminosalicylates is detailed in Table 24.

Baseline disease characteristics were generally well balanced among treatment arms (Table 25). In the 
ITT1A population 47.1% of subjects failed 1 biologic and 52.9% of subjects failed more than 1 biologic.  
The most common CD location per SES-CD was in the ileal-colonic region at 46.9%. Overall, 
approximately 34% and approximately 23% of subjects were on concomitant corticosteroids and/or 
immunomodulators at baseline, respectively.

Treatment Compliance 
Overall, mean treatment compliance during the 12-Week Induction Period was comparable across 
treatment arms (99.6% in the risankizumab 600 mg arm, 97.9% in the risankizumab 1200 mg arm, 
and 99.0% in the placebo arm). 
Outcomes and estimation 
Co-Primary Endpoint OUS 
The study met the co-primary endpoints of clinical remission and endoscopic response for the 
risankizumab 600 mg and 1200 mg arms compared to the placebo arm for both the US protocol and 
the OUS specific protocol. 
At Week 12 a statistically significant greater (p-value ≤ 0.001) proportion of subjects in the 
risankizumab 600 mg and risankizumab 1200 mg arms achieved the co-primary endpoint of clinical 
remission (defined by CDAI in the US protocol and by SF/APS in the OUS protocol) compared to 
placebo arm (Table 26 and Table 27).  
At Week 12, a statistically significantly greater (p-value < 0.001) proportion of subjects in the 
risankizumab 600 mg and risankizumab 1200 mg arms achieved endoscopic response, assessed in 
both the US protocol and the OUS protocol, compared to the placebo arm (Table 28). Overall, 
numerically similar results were observed for the risankizumab 600 mg arm and the risankizumab 
1200 mg arm.

Key Secondary Endpoints OUS 
The key secondary endpoints (i.e., endpoints under the overall type I error control) for the OUS 
protocols are summarised in Table 29. Overall, both risankizumab arms (600 mg and 1200 mg) have 
clear treatment effect over placebo for resolution of clinical symptoms, improvements in quality of life 
(QoL), reduction in mucosal inflammation as measured by endoscopy, and CD-related hospitalizations.  
A majority of endpoints were statistically significant for the risankizumab 600 mg arm and the 
risankizumab 1200 mg arm versus placebo for the OUS protocol. 
Overall efficacy rates for the risankizumab 600 mg and 1200 mg arms were numerically similar. 
Clinical response and clinical remission, as defined by CDAI and SF/APS, were seen at Week 4, with 
statistically significant differences observed for risankizumab 600 mg and 1200 mg arms versus 
placebo. Additionally, clinical response per CDAI and SF/APS were statistically significant for each 
risankizumab dose versus placebo at Week 12, with greater efficacy and treatment differences relative 
to those at Week 4.  
Other patient reported outcome (PRO) questionnaires that summarize QoL, such as Inflammatory 
Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ), Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-
Fatigue, and SF-36, showed overall numerically higher improvement in the risankizumab arms versus 
placebo and statistical significance is shown in Table 29. 
Endoscopic remission and ulcer-free endoscopy at Week 12 were statistically significant versus placebo 
in the OUS protocol. The composite endpoint for clinical response (per CDAI and SF/APS) and 
endoscopic response (i.e., clinical response and endoscopic response in the same patient), were also 
statistically significant for the risankizumab arms versus placebo. 
CD-related hospitalizations were lower in the risankizumab groups versus placebo and met statistical 
significance. Additionally, while the total number of subjects analyzed was small, there was a trend for 
reduction in extra-intestinal manifestations (EIMs) for subjects who received risankizumab versus 
placebo. Due to the small sample size of the number of subjects with draining fistulas at baseline (N = 
45), no meaningful conclusions can be drawn and the endpoint did not meet statistical significance.

Ancillary analyses 
The MAH has provided data on a range of exploratory endpoints for the ITT1A population.  Overall, 
these endpoints offer supportive data to the co-primary and key secondary endpoints. Symptom 
improvement as noted (shown by changes over time in clinical remission [per CDAI or SF/APS], mean 
APS, APS remission, mean SF, SF remission, clinical response [per CDAI, enhanced (SF/APS), or 
SF/APS], Crohn's Symptom Severity [CSS], resolution of EIMs, PGIC, and PGIS) and QoL improvement 
(shown by improvements in IBDQ, FACIT-Fatigue, WPAI-CD, EQ- 5D-5L, and SF-36 scores) were

observed over time for the risankizumab arms versus placebo. In addition, changes from baseline in 
SES-CD at Week 12 were greater in the risankizumab arms versus placebo. 
Additionally, decreases in the biomarkers of FCP and hs-CRP were observed as early at Week 4 for the 
risankizumab arms versus placebo. The decrease of hs-CRP and FCP from baseline in risankizumab 
arms compared to placebo continued through to Week 12.  
The MAH has also provided data from the additional efficacy populations to support the efficacy of RZB, 
these populations include the ITT1B, ITT2A and ITT2B. 
12-Week Induction Period, ITT1B Population 
The ITT1B population was used for exploratory efficacy analysis purposes and includes the subjects 
who were in ITT1 set for the 12-Week Induction Period but did not have baseline eligible SES-CD of ≥ 
6 (≥ 4 for isolated ileal disease). These subjects had lower baseline eligible SES-CD than included in 
the ITT1A population, excluding the narrowing component. Overall, the efficacy results in the ITT1B 
population were similar to the ITT1A population. 
Induction Period 2, ITT2A Population 
For subjects who did not achieve SF/APS clinical response at Week 12, defined as a ≥ 30% decrease in 
average daily SF and/or ≥ 30% decrease in average daily AP score and both not worse than baseline, 
the proportion who achieved SF/APS clinical response at Week 24 was high and numerically similar 
across all treatment arms (Table 30). 
Table 30 Clinical Response (SF/APS) at Week 24 among Clinical Non-responders at the Entry of 
Induction Period 2 (As Observed) (ITT2A Population) 
Induction Period 2, ITT2B Population 
The ITT2B population was used for exploratory efficacy analysis purposes and includes the subjects 
who were in ITT2 set for Induction Period 2 but did not have baseline eligible SES-CD of ≥ 6 (≥ 4 for 
isolated ileal disease) (i.e., had a lower baseline eligible SES-CD). 
Overall, the efficacy results in the ITT2B population were supportive of a treatment effect. 
Induction Study M16-006:  
Sample size 
Sample size calculation is based on the larger sample size needed to detect treatment difference for 
each of the co-primary endpoints. Since historical data show slightly lower event rate and similar 
treatment difference versus placebo for the endoscopic response rate than the CDAI clinical remission 
rate at Week 52, CDAI clinical remission rates at Week 52 are used for power calculation. Assuming 
the Week 52 CDAI clinical remission rate will be 46% for one of the risankizumab treatment groups 
and 28% for the placebo group, a sample size of 150 subjects for each of the risankizumab treatment 
CHMP assessment report on group of extensions of marketing authorisation  
EMA/887275/2022  
Page 97/258 
 
 
 
 
 
 
groups and 150 for the placebo group will have 87% power to detect the treatment difference between 
risankizumab and placebo using Fisher's exact test at a 0.05 significant level (two-sided). Assuming 
the Week 52 clinical remission rate will be 38.7% for one of the risankizumab treatment groups and 
20% for the placebo group, a sample size of 150 subjects for each of the risankizumab treatment 
groups and 150 for the placebo group will have 93% power to detect the treatment difference between 
risankizumab and placebo using Fisher's exact test at a 0.05 significant level (two-sided). Assuming 
the Week 52 endoscopic response rate will be 32.6% for one of the risankizumab dose groups and 
10% for the placebo group, this sample size will have > 95% power to detect the treatment difference 
between risankizumab and placebo using a Fisher's exact test at a 0.05 significant level (two-sided). 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
At baseline, eligible patients were randomized to three parallel groups with 1200 mg IV and 600 mg IV 
dose of risankizumab treatments or placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio. The 12-Week Induction Period 
randomization were stratified by number of prior biologics failed (1, > 1), baseline steroid use (Yes, 
No), and baseline eligible SES-CD (original, alternative), where the stratum of "original" includes the 
patients with baseline eligible SES-CD of ≥ 6 (or ≥ 4 for subjects with isolated ileal disease), and the 
stratum of "alternative" includes the patients with baseline eligible SES-CD of ≥ 3 to < 6 for ileocolonic 
or colonic disease or SES-CD of 3 for isolated ileal disease.  
Subjects with clinical non-response to risankizumab at Week 12 were to be re-randomized in a 1:1:1 
ratio to risankizumab 1200 mg IV dose group, risankizumab 360 mg SC dose group, or risankizumab 
180 mg SC dose group in the Induction Period 2. Subjects with clinical non-response to placebo at 
Week 12 blindly received risankizumab 1200 mg IV dose. No stratification was made for the Induction 
Period 2 randomization. 
Statistical methods 
A statistical analysis plan (SAP) was written and signed off prior to data base lock which included a 
number of amendments. These amendments are unlikely to have influenced the analyses outcomes for 
the primary outcome as far as can be ascertained.  
The primary hypotheses for the co-primary endpoint were stated as: 
(iii) 
The proportion of subjects achieving clinical remission treated with risakizumab is 
greater than that treated with placebo at Week 12  
(iv) 
The proportion of subjects achieving endoscopic response treated with risakizumab is 
greater than that treated with placebo at Week 12 
The estimands corresponding to the primary efficacy objective for global protocol outside US were 
stated to have been defined mainly as a definition of the outcome. Intercurrent events were specified 
as: 1) premature discontinuation of study drug and 2) initiation or dose escalation of CD-related 
corticosteroids. 
Several analyses populations were defined, with the key one for the purposes of this assessment being 
the Intent-to-Treat Population (ITT) that included subjects who received at least one dose of study 
drug; for the 12-Week Induction Period, ITT1 was defined as randomized subjects who received at 
least one dose of study drug during the 12-Week Induction Period. 
For the primary outcome, the Cochran Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test adjusting for stratification factors 
was used. If there was a stratum for a treatment group that had no subjects in it, a value of 0.1 was 
used.  
CHMP assessment report on group of extensions of marketing authorisation  
EMA/887275/2022  
Page 98/258 
 
 
 
 
 
Point estimates and 95% confidence interval (CI)s for the difference in proportions between each of 
risankizumab treatment groups and placebo were be provided. Construction of CI for the common risk 
difference was based on the Mantel-Haenszel estimate adjusting for stratification factors.  
For analysis of continuous Variables a Mixed-Effect Model Repeated Measurement (MMRM) model was 
used. A hierarchical Multiplicity approach was adopted that split the initial 5% alpha to each of the two 
doses (testing each dose at 2.5% level) and then sequentially testing secondary endpoints, after both 
co-primary endpoints were rejected. A sequential testing approach thereafter was adopted until the 
last 10 secondary endpoints were reached after which a Bonferroni-Holm procedure was adopted.

Results 
Participant Flow 
Intent-to-Treat Population 
The ITT population includes subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug. 
12-Week Induction Period: 
The ITT population for the 12-Week Induction Period (denoted as ITT1) includes randomized subjects 
who received at least 1 dose of study drug during this period. 
• 
ITT1A: includes the subjects with a baseline eligible SES-CD of ≥ 6 (≥ 4 for isolated ileal 
disease); the primary population for the efficacy analysis. N = 850 (336 subjects in the 
risankizumab 600 mg arm, 339 subjects in the risankizumab 1200 mg arm, and 175 subjects 
in the placebo arm) 
• 
ITT1B: includes the subjects not included in ITT1A because they did not have baseline eligible 
SES-CD of ≥ 6 (≥ 4 for isolated ileal disease). These subjects had a lower baseline eligible 
SES-CD and were used for exploratory efficacy analyses. N = 76 (35 subjects in the 
risankizumab 600 mg arm, 31 subjects in the risankizumab 1200 mg arm, and 10 subjects in 
the placebo arm) 
Five subjects from a non-compliant site were excluded from the efficacy analyses for 12-Week 
Induction Period (excluded from ITT1A: 1 subject in the placebo arm, 2 subjects in the risankizumab 
600 mg arm, and 2 subjects in the risankizumab 1200 mg arm).

Induction Period 2: 
The ITT population for the Induction Period 2 (denoted as ITT2) includes subjects who were 
randomized and received at least 1 dose of risankizumab during the Induction Period 2, and the 
subjects who received placebo induction treatment during 12-Week Induction Period and entered the 
Induction Period 2 (denoted as placebo/risankizumab). 
The placebo/risankizumab subjects were analyzed as a separate treatment group in the Induction 
Period 2. 
• 
ITT2A: includes subjects who had baseline eligible SES-CD of ≥ 6 (≥ 4 for isolated ileal 
disease). N = 254 (65 subjects in the risankizumab 180 mg SC arm, 60 subjects in the 
risankizumab 360 mg SC arm, 57 subjects in the risankizumab 1200 mg IV arm, and 72 
subjects in the placebo IV/risankizumab 1200 mg IV arm) 
• 
ITT2B: includes the subjects who did not have baseline eligible SES-CD of ≥ 6 (≥ 4 for isolated 
ileal disease). These subjects had a lower baseline eligible SES-CD and were used for 
exploratory efficacy analysis. N = 21 (1 subject in the risankizumab 180 mg SC arm, 8 
subjects in the risankizumab 360 mg SC arm, 9 subjects in the risankizumab 1200 mg IV arm, 
and 3 subjects in the placebo IV/risankizumab 1200 mg IV arm) 
Three subjects from a non-compliant site were excluded from the efficacy analyses for Induction Period 
2 (excluded from ITT2A: 1 subject in the risankizumab 180 mg SC arm, no subjects in the 
risankizumab 360 mg SC arm, 1 subject in the risankizumab 1200 mg IV arm, and 1 subject in the 
placebo IV/risankizumab 1200 mg IV arm). 
For the corresponding ITT populations, subjects were assigned to a treatment group based on the 
randomization or re-randomization schedule, regardless of the treatment actually received. The 
demographics/baseline and efficacy analyses were based on the corresponding ITT population. 
During the first 12-week Induction Period, a higher percentage of subjects in the risankizumab 600 mg 
and risankizumab 1200 mg treatment arms compared to placebo completed study drug. The most 
frequent primary reason for discontinuation of study drug in all treatment arms was an AE, and the 
number of subjects who discontinued study drug due to AE was numerically higher in the placebo arm 
compared to either risankizumab arm. The most frequently reported AE that led to discontinuation was 
Crohn's disease (2 subjects in the risankizumab 600 mg arm, 2 subjects in the risankizumab 1200 mg 
arm, and 7 subjects in the placebo arm), suggesting a lack of efficacy of study drug in these subjects. 
Subject final status and reasons for discontinuation of study drug during the first 12-Week Induction 
Period are shown in Table 31.

Period (SA1 Population) 
Protocol Deviations 
For the ITT1A population a summary of the major protocol deviations is shown below. 
Protocol deviations were defined in accordance with the ICH guidelines and included, but were not 
limited to, the following: inclusion/exclusion criteria violation (75 [8.8%] total subjects), receipt of 
wrong treatment or incorrect dose of study drug (4 [0.5%] total subjects), development of withdrawal 
criteria without being withdrawn (no subjects), and use of prohibited concomitant medications (35 
[4.1%] total subjects). 
According to the MAH the protocol deviations were not considered to have affected the study or 
interpretation of study results or conclusions.

Baseline Data 
12-Week Induction Period ITT1A Population 
Key baseline demographics were generally balanced between the three treatment arms (Table 32). 
Overall, the majority of subjects were white, not Hispanic or Latino, were between the ages of 18 and 
< 40, and were normal weight according to body mass index (BMI).

Use of any prior Crohn's disease-related medication was reported by 99.3% of subjects (Table 33). The 
most frequently reported prior CD-related medications used by the treatment groups were azathioprine 
(55.6% of subjects) and mesalazine (52% of subjects).

Baseline disease characteristics were generally well balanced among treatment arms (Table 34). In the 
ITT1A population, there were 491 subjects in the Bio-IR population and 359 subjects in the non-Bio-IR 
population; 28.1% of subjects failed 1 biologic and 29.6% of subjects failed more than 1 biologic. In 
the Bio-IR population, 95.1% subjects failed 1 or more anti-TNF and 28.9% failed vedolizumab.  
The most common CD location per SES-CD was in the ileal-colonic region (49.6% of all subjects).  
Overall, approximately 30% and approximately 24% of subjects were on concomitant corticosteroids 
and/or immunomodulators at baseline, respectively.

Treatment Compliance 12-Week Induction Period 
Overall mean treatment compliance during the 12-Week Induction Period was comparable across 
treatment arms (99.4% in the risankizumab 600 mg arm, 98.3% in the risankizumab 1200 mg arm, 
and 98.7% in the placebo arm). 
Outcomes and estimation 
The study met the co-primary endpoints of clinical remission and endoscopic response for the 
risankizumab 600 mg and 1200 mg arms compared to the placebo arm for both the US protocol and 
the OUS protocol. At Week 12, a statistically significantly greater (p-value < 0.001) proportion of 
subjects in the risankizumab 600 mg and risankizumab 1200 arms achieved the co-primary endpoint of 
clinical remission (as defined by the CDAI in the US protocol and by the SF/APS in the OUS protocol) 
compared to the placebo arm (Table 35 and Table 36).  
At Week 12, a statistically significantly greater (p-value < 0.001) proportion of subjects in the 
risankizumab 600 mg and risankizumab 1200 mg arms achieved endoscopic response, assessed in 
both the US protocol and the OUS protocol, compared to the placebo arm (Table 37). 
In addition, a clear treatment effect was demonstrated in the key subgroup populations of non-Bio-IR 
and Bio-IR for all co-primary endpoints, with higher efficacy and effect size noted in the non-Bio-IR 
population. Overall, numerically similar results were observed for the risankizumab 600 mg arm and 
the risankizumab 1200 mg arm in the overall population as well as both subgroup populations.

Overall, both risankizumab arms (600 mg and 1200 mg) demonstrated clear treatment effects over 
placebo for resolution of clinical symptoms, improvements in quality of life (QoL), reduction in mucosal 
inflammation as measured by endoscopy, and CD-related hospitalizations. A majority of endpoints 
were statistically significant for the risankizumab 600 mg arm and the risankizumab 1200 mg arm 
versus placebo (this was the case for both the US and OUS protocols). Overall efficacy rates for the 
risankizumab 600 mg and 1200 mg arms were numerically similar. 
Clinical response and clinical remission, as defined by CDAI and SF/APS, were seen at Week 4, with 
statistically significant differences observed for the risankizumab 600 mg and 1200 mg arms versus 
placebo.  
Additionally, clinical response per CDAI and SF/APS were statistically significant for each risankizumab 
arm versus placebo at Week 12, with greater efficacy and treatment differences relative to those at 
Week 4. Other patient reported outcome (PRO) questionnaires that summarize QoL, such as 
Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ), Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy 
(FACIT)-Fatigue, Work Productivity and Impairment Questionnaire – Crohn's disease (WPAI-CD), and 
SF-36, showed overall numerically better improvement in the risankizumab arms versus placebo.

Additional Efficacy Variables 
The MAH has provided data on a range of exploratory endpoints for the ITT1A population.   
Overall, these endpoints offer supportive data to the co-primary and key secondary endpoints. 
Symptom improvement (shown by changes over time in clinical remission [per CDAI or SF/APS], mean 
APS, APS remission, mean SF, SF remission, clinical response [per CDAI, enhanced (SF/APS), or 
SF/APS], Crohn's Symptom Severity [CSS], resolution of EIMs, PGIC, and PGIS) and QoL improvement 
(shown by improvements in IBDQ, FACIT-Fatigue, WPAI-CD, EQ-5D-5L, and SF-36 scores) were

observed over time for the risankizumab arms versus placebo. Changes from baseline in SES-CD at 
Week 12 were greater in the risankizumab arms versus placebo. 
Additionally, decreases in the biomarkers of hs-CRP and FCP were observed as early as Week 4 and 
were sustained at Week 12 for the risankizumab 600 mg and 1200 mg arms versus placebo. The 
decreases in mean hs-CRP for the risankizumab 600 mg and 1200 mg treatment arms were 
numerically larger than the placebo arm at Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12 (nominal p-value < 0.001 in 
each risankizumab treatment arm at all 3 timepoints). The differences in mean FCP for the 
risankizumab 600 mg and 1200 mg treatment arms were numerically larger than placebo at Week 4 
(risankizumab 600 mg nominal p-value < 0.001; risankizumab 1200 mg nominal p-value = 0.003) and 
at Week 12 (nominal p-value < 0.001 in each risankizumab treatment arm). 
12-Week Induction Period, ITT1B Population 
The ITT1B population was used for exploratory efficacy analysis purposes and includes the subjects 
who were in ITT1 set for the 12-Week Induction Period but did not have baseline eligible SES-CD of ≥ 
6 (≥ 4 for isolated ileal disease). These subjects had lower baseline eligible SES-CD than included in 
the ITT1A population, excluding the narrowing component. Overall, the efficacy results in the ITT1B 
population were similar to the ITT1A population. 
Induction Period 2 ITT2A Population 
Subjects in the risankizumab treatment arms who did not achieve SF/APS clinical response (defined as 
a ≥ 30% decrease in average daily SF and/or ≥ 30% decrease in average daily APS and both not 
worse than baseline) at Week 12 were then randomized 1:1:1 into Induction Period 2 and subjects in 
the placebo arm who did not achieve SF/APS clinical response at Week 12 received risankizumab 1200 
mg IV during Induction Period 2.   
For these subjects baseline demographics and disease characteristics were generally balanced between 
the three treatment arms.  
The proportion who achieved SF/APS clinical response at Week 24 was high and numerically similar 
across all treatment arms (Table 39). 
Table 39 Clinical Response (SF/APS) at Week 24 among Clinical Non-responders at the Entry of 
Induction Period 2 (As Observed) (ITT2A Population) 
Induction Period 2, ITT2B Population 
The ITT2B population was used for exploratory efficacy analysis purposes and includes the subjects 
who were in ITT2 set for Induction Period 2 but did not have baseline eligible SES-CD of ≥ 6 (≥ 4 for 
isolated ileal disease) (i.e., had a lower baseline eligible SES-CD). Overall, the efficacy results in the 
ITT2B population were supportive of a treatment effect.

Maintenance Study M16-000 Sub-Study 1 
Title: A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled 52-Week Maintenance and an 
Open-Label Extension Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Risankizumab in Subjects with Crohn's 
Disease 
Study M16-000 consists of three sub-studies.  Only the randomised portion of M16-000 Sub-Study 1, 
as pivotal, is discussed below. 
•  Sub-Study 2, also a 52-week maintenance study, is an ongoing randomized study with the 
objective of evaluating 2 methods of dose-escalation for subjects with loss of response during 
maintenance treatment.   
•  Sub-Study 3 is an ongoing open-label (OL) extension with the objective of collecting long-term 
safety data. 
Methods 
M16-000 Sub-Study 1 was a Phase 3, multi-centre, 52-week maintenance study with a 20-week 
Follow-Up period, consisting of a randomized (pivotal) and non-randomized portion.  The randomized 
portion was a re-randomized responder withdrawal design, double blind and placebo controlled.  
Subjects from M15-998 and M16-006, with SF/APS clinical response and a Baseline induction eligibility 
SES-CD of ≥ 6 (≥ 4 for isolated ileal disease) excluding the narrowing component after 12 weeks of 
RZB IV induction (600 mg or 1200 mg), were re-randomized 1:1:1 to continue receiving RZB 180 mg 
SC q8w or RZB 360 mg SC q8w, or to have RZB treatment withdrawn (via administration of blinded 
PBO Sc). Study duration was approximately 68 weeks. 
Dose selection was based on data from the dose-ranging Phase 2 Study M15-993 and preliminary 
PK/pharmacodynamic modeling, which suggested doses higher than Phase 2 tested doses could be 
evaluated to further define the dose/exposure-response relationship. In Study M15-993, which tested 
RZB 180 mg SC q8w for 26 weeks in subjects who achieved clinical remission to RZB induction 
treatment, approximately 30% of subjects lost clinical remission and a majority did not achieve 
endoscopic remission or deep remission endpoints.   
In the schematic, blue boxes identify the primary efficacy analysis set.

IR = induction response; IV = intravenous; PBO = placebo; q8w = every 8 weeks; RZB = risankizumab; SC = subcutaneous; Wk 
= week 
Starting at Week 16, subjects who demonstrated loss of response during Sub-Study 1 based upon increased symptom activity and 
confirmation with objective markers of inflammation were eligible to receive OL risankizumab rescue therapy (risankizumab 
1200 mg IV for one dose followed by risankizumab 360 mg SC q8w). 
Study participants  
Subjects were enrolled from M150991 or M16-006 into Sub-Study 1 if they achieved SF/APS clinical 
response to RZB (either at Week 12 of the 12-Week Induction Period or at Week 24 after Induction 
Period 2 (placebo up to Week 12).   
For subjects receiving concomitant CS, tapering was mandatory starting at Week 0/re-randomisation.  
Initiation of, increase in dose, or decrease in dose of other concomitant CD-medications (i.e., ASA, oral 
locally acting CS, or IMM) was prohibited during the 52-Week maintenance period.   
Starting at Week 16, subjects with loss of response were eligible to receive open label RZB rescue 
therapy - RZB 1200 mg IV x one dose, then RZB 360 mg SC q8w. 
Subjects who initiated new or had a dose escalation of CS, or who received OL rescue treatment were 
categorized as non-responders for primary efficacy analyses of co-primary endpoints.   
The target for enrolment was 450 subjects, with enrolment duration extended to include ≤ 15% more 
subjects to mitigate against potential missed visits due the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. 
Treatments 
Subjects were randomized 1:1:1 to receive either RZB 360 mg SC or RZB 180 mg SC or PBO.  
PBO was matched (IV and SC) to maintain blinding. 
Dosing occurred every 8 weeks: Week 0, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40 and 48.

Objectives 
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of continuing RZB as maintenance therapy vs. withdrawing RZB 
treatment in subjects with moderately to severely active CD who responded to intravenous RZB IV 
induction treatment in study M16-006 or M15-991 and who had a Baseline of induction eligibility SES-
CD of ≥ 6 (≥ 4 for isolated ileal disease).  
2.6.5.3.  Outcomes/endpoints 
Co-primary endpoint at Week 52 
The co-primary endpoint, at week 52, was similar to that of the induction studies: 
- 
- 
the achievement of clinical remission (SF/APS) and 
the achievement of endoscopic response.  
(For the US protocol co-primary endpoints were CDAI clinical remission at Week 52 and the proportion 
of subjects with endoscopic response at Week 52.) 
Key secondary endpoints at/by Week 52 
Most key secondary endpoints at or by Week 52 were similar to the induction studies, with differing 
rank order.  There was no endpoint for fistula or EIMS evaluation; there were 4 new endpoints based 
on SF/APS.

There were additional endpoints to evaluate efficacy, PK & immunogenicity and safety evaluations.  
Exposure adjusted occurrence of CD-related hospitalisations from Week 0 to Week 52 was assessed. 
Endpoints were, in the main, similar to the induction studies and are not further discussed here. 
2.6.5.4.  Sample size 
For sample size calculations it was assumed that the Week 52 rate of clinical remission (SF/APS) would 
be 38.7% for one of the RZB arms vs. 20% in the PBO arm. A sample size of 150 subjects per arm was 
determined to have 93% power to detect treatment differences between one of the RZB arms and 
PBO, using Fisher’s exact test at an alpha of 0.05 (two-sided).  
Using this sample size (n=150 per arm), assuming the Week 52 endoscopic response rate would be 
32.6% for one of the RZB arms vs. 10% in the PBO arm, power would be >95% to detect a treatment 
difference between the RZB arms and PBO, using Fisher’s exact test at an alpha of 0.05 (two-sided). 
2.6.5.5.  Randomisation 
All subjects were to maintain the unique identification number assigned at the Screening visit of M16-
006 or M15-991 and were to be centrally re-randomised by web-based IRT for Sub-Study 1. 
Enrolled subjects, re-randomized into 2 RZB dose arms or PBO arm 1:1:1 (150 subjects per arm), 
were stratified by endoscopic response (per local read), clinical remission status from the last visit of 
M16-006 or M15-998 and RZB induction dose (600 mg or 1200mg IV).  
CHMP assessment report on group of extensions of marketing authorisation  
EMA/887275/2022  
Page 120/258 
 
 
 
 
2.6.5.6.  Blinding (masking) 
Participants, those administering interventions and those assessing outcomes were blinded to group 
assignment. PBO and RZB (IV or SC) presentations were identical in match to maintain blinding. 
Applicant personnel with direct oversight of the conduct and management of the study, the 
Investigators, blinded study site personnel and subjects were to remain blinded to study treatment 
throughout the blinded period of the study. The Investigator was able to access the IRT system to 
break the blind in case of a medical emergency.  
2.6.5.7.  Statistical methods 
Efficacy 
The comparisons between each of the RZB dose arms vs. PBO for the primary efficacy variable were 
performed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test adjusted by M16-000 Week 0 SF/APS clinical 
remission status and M16-000 Week 0 endoscopic response status (per central read), and last RZB 
induction dose.  
A multiple testing procedure was used to provide strong control of the Type I error rate at alpha = 
0.05 (2 sided) across analyses comparing each RZB dose arm to PBO with respect to the co primary 
endpoints and key secondary endpoints. A CMH based two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the 
difference between treatment arms was calculated. 
Continuous secondary efficacy variables collected at only one post-Week 0 visit were analyzed using an 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model including treatment, stratification factors, and measurements 
at both induction Baseline and Week 0. 
The primary analysis was conducted in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) 1A population, which included the 
randomized subjects in the ITT1 set (subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug) who had 
eligibility SES-CD of ≥ 6 (≥ 4 for isolated ileal disease) at Baseline of the induction study and received 
RZB IV for only 1 period of 12 weeks in the induction study.  
Results  
Participant flow  
Sub-study 1 enrolled 712 subjects from the induction studies, across 273 sites worldwide (ITT1). 
Of these, 542 subjects entered the randomised group. 
Of these, 52 subjects were found to have a low SES-CD score and were excluded from primary analysis 
(ITT1B). In addition, the data of 5 subjects was excluded from efficacy analysis prior to DBL, due to 
identified site non-compliance. 
Of 485 subjects remaining, 23 subjects were excluded from primary analysis as their treatment 
response came after 24 weeks of RZB induction treatment, rather than 12 weeks. 
The remaining 462 subjects (outlined in red in the diagram below) form the ITT1A population, the 
primary population for efficacy analysis in Sub-Study 1. ITT1A randomized subjects had eligibility SES-
CD of ≥ 6 (≥ 4 for isolated ileal disease) at Baseline of the study and received IV risankizumab for only 
1 period of 12 weeks in the induction studies M15-991 or M16-006.

ITT1A subjects were re-randomised to the RZB 180 mg SC arm (n=157) or the RZB 360 mg SC arm 
(n=141) or the Withdrawal/Placebo SC arm (n=164). 
As shown in the table below, a similar percentage (87-92%) completed study drug across the 3 arms.   
Mean treatment compliance among randomized subjects was reported as > 99.0% across treatment 
arms.

EMA/887275/2022  
Page 122/258 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The most common primary reason for discontinuation was: 
-  RZB 180 mg SC - lack of efficacy (5/157; 3.2%); AE, lost to follow-up, subject withdrawal or 
another reason (each 2/157; 1.3%) 
-  RZB 360 mg SC arm - lack of efficacy (6/141; 4.3%); AE or another reason (each 4/141; 
2.8%). 
- 
PBO arm - lack of efficacy (9/164; 5.5%); another reason (6/164; 3.7%); AE (3/164; 1.8%).   
No subjects were discontinued due to Covid-19; 1 subject (RZB 360 mg SC arm) discontinued due to 
Covid 19 logistical restrictions (<1%). 
The number of subjects who received rescue medication was:  
RZB 180 mg SC (38/157; 24.2%) vs. RZB 360 mg SC (30/141; 21.3%) vs. PBO (66/164; 40.2%) 
Protocol Deviations 
The data of 5 subjects was excluded from efficacy analysis prior to data base lock, in line with the pre-
specified SAP, due to investigator non-compliance. 
For the remaining ITT1A population (n=462) similar rates of subjects with at least one protocol 
deviation were reported across treatment arms (14.6-15.3%), most commonly receiving excluded 
concomitant treatment (9.2-13.4%) followed by inclusion criteria deviations (1.8-5.0%). 
The protocol deviations were not considered to have affected the study or interpretation of study 
results or conclusions.  
Recruitment 
First subject first visit: 09 April 2018; Last subject last visit: 26 April 2021; Database lock 15 May 2021 
Enrolment duration was extended to include up to 15% more subjects to mitigate against potential 
missed visits due the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Conduct of the study 
According to the protocol dated 26 April 2021, 9 amendments were made to the original protocol dated 
17 February 2017. Some amendment aspects were discussed under SA with regulatory authorities e.g.

None of the approved amendments were considered to have affected the interpretation of the M16-000 
Sub-Study 1 analysis and all were approved before data base lock for Sub-Study 1 on 15 May 2021.  
Significant non-compliance was identified at one investigational site  before the database lock. As was 
pre-specified in the final SAP, for the subjects (n=8) enrolled at this investigational site efficacy data 
was excluded and safety data included in statistical analyses. 
Baseline data  
Intent-to-Treat (ITT) 1A population  
Key baseline demographics were generally balanced across the 3 treatment arms. Overall, the majority 
of subjects were white, not Hispanic or Latino, aged 18 to < 40 years and of normal weight (BMI).

The clinical characteristics were generally similar and balanced across arms at Baseline of Induction 
and at Week 0 of Sub-Study 1, apart from a higher hs-CRP in the RZB 360 mg SC arm.

At Baseline of induction CS use (PBO 31.1%; RZB 180 mg SC 32.5%; RZB 360 mg SC 29.8%) and 
IMM use (PBO 24.4%; RZB 180 mg SC 26.1%; RZB 360 mg SC 28.4%) were similar. 
At Baseline of the Induction study, overall approximately 27% had not failed a biologic, approximately 
33% had failed 1 prior biologic and approximately 40% had failed >1 prior biologic (see table below).  
Mean treatment compliance among randomized subjects was reported as > 99.0% across the RZB 180 
mg SC, RZB 360 mg SC and PBO arms. 
As detailed in the table 42, the use of concomitant CD-related medication at Baseline of the induction 
studies was reported by 66.2% of ITT1A subjects, most commonly CS (31.2%), IMM (26.2%) and, 
individually, mesalazine (26.2%) and azathioprine (20.8%).

By Week 52, 51.8% (73/141) of patients on RZB 360 mg SC maintenance treatment achieved clinical 
remission (SF/APS) vs 39.6% (65/164) PBO; 46.5% (66/141) of patients on RZB 360 mg SC 
maintenance treatment achieved endoscopic response vs 22.0% (36/164) PBO.   
The co-primary endpoint of clinical remission (SF/APS) was not met at 52 weeks for RZB 180 mg SC 
vs. PBO - the difference in favour of RZB treatment, 7.7%, was not statistically significant (95% CI -
2.1-17.5%). As per the pre-defined graphical testing procedure for the OUS protocol, testing was 
halted and therefore no secondary endpoints achieved statistical significance. Therefore, results for the 
key secondary endpoints are presented with nominal P values. 
As noted in table above, for the US protocol, the study met the co-primary endpoints of CDAI clinical 
remission and endoscopic response for the RZB 180 mg SC and RZB 360 mg SC arms vs. PBO 
(P values ≤ 0.01 for both endpoints).

Enhanced clinical response 
Exposure-adjusted CD-related hospitalizations from Week 0 through Week 52 
Overall, the symptomatic endpoints showed a degree of efficacy for both RZB regimens vs. PBO. 
Regarding mucosal healing, for the results of endoscopic and composite endpoints, dose response was 
observed, with numerically higher efficacy for RZB 360 mg SC vs. RZB 180 mg SC arm vs. PBO.   
The proportion of subjects with endoscopic remission in the RZB 360 mg SC arm increased over time, 
from 28.7% at Week 0 to 39.1% at Week 52; the proportion in the RZB 180 mg SC arm remained 
stable (29.1% at Week 0; 29.9% at Week 52); the proportion in the PBO arm decreased (28.4% at 
Week 0; 12.8% at Week 52). 
Similar trends were observed for other endoscopic endpoints e.g. ulcer-free endoscopy (Table 45).

Remission at Week 0 and Week 52 (ITT1A Population)

CS-free clinical remission (SF/APS), for subjects who took CS at baseline of induction, was numerically 
in favour of RZB 180 mg SC (27/51, 52.9%) vs. RZB 369 mg SC (11/42, 25.6%) vs. PBO (12/51, 
23.5%). 
Regarding QoL, the results were numerically similar across treatment arms. 
The incidence rate of CD-related hospitalizations reported through Week 52 was low in all groups: RZB 
180 mg SC (5) vs. RZB 360 mg SC (9) vs. PBO (8).  
For non-ranked secondary inflammatory markers (i.e., hs-CRP and FCP), SES-CD and serum IL-22 
levels decreased in subjects in the RZB arms over 52 weeks. These markers stayed the same as at 
Week 0 or increased in subjects in the PBO arm over 52 weeks. 
Placebo (PBO) response 
Prolonged efficacy is apparent in the PBO/withdrawal arm and the magnitude of PBO responses for 
some endpoints is noted. Similar rates of clinical remission and clinical response were observed 
through Week 16 between the RZB SC and PBO arms, with rates decreasing thereafter in the PBO arm. 
Both observed and population PK model-predicted RZB PK profiles during the maintenance period  
indicated prolonged RZB residual exposures from the previous induction treatment in PBO arm, up to 
at least Week 16. Also, prolonged suppression of IL-22 was observed in the PBO arm at Week 52 
compared to the Baseline of Induction.

Subgroup Analyses 
Bio-IR & Non-Bio-IR Subgroups 
The range of proportion of subjects across the randomized arms were 72-75% BIO-IR vs 25-28% non-
BIO-IR. 
At Week 52, as shown in the following table, higher response rates were reported in the non-Bio-IR 
and Bio-IR subjects for both induction doses vs PBO.    
For the BIO-IR group, the response rate difference to PBO was greater for the RZB 360 mg dose vs the 
RZB 180 mg dose for the co-primary endpoints (clinical remission (SF/APS) 14.0% (95% CI 1.1, 26.8) 
vs 6.6 % (95% CI -5.8, 18.9) respectively; endoscopic response 23.4 % (95% CI 11.4, 35.4) vs 
20.4% (95 % CI 8.9, 31.9) respectively).  
For the non-BIO-IR group, the response rate difference to PBO for the co-primary endpoint of clinical 
remission (SF/APS) was similar for RZB 180 mg, 5.3% (95% CI -15.7, 26.2) and RZB 360 mg, 5.4% 
(95% CI -16.1, 27.0).  The response rate difference to PBO for the co-primary endpoint of endoscopic 
response was greater for the RZB 180 mg dose, 36.8% (95% CI 17.2, 56.5) vs. the RZB 360 mg dose, 
27.0% (95% CI 6.3, 47.7). 
The PBO (withdrawal) response rates are noted, as are the small number of subjects in the non-BIO-IR 
groups shown.

The range of proportion of subjects across the randomized arms were 44-46% with RZB 600 mg 
induction completed and 54-56% with RZB 1200mg induction completed. 
For the RZB 600 mg induction group, the response rate difference to PBO was greater for the RZB 360 
mg maintenance dose vs the RZB 180 mg dose for the co-primary endpoints (clinical remission

(SF/APS) 3.2% (95% CI -13.5, 19.8) vs -1.6 % (95% -13.5, 19.8) respectively; endoscopic response 
23.0% (95 % CI 7.0, 38.9) vs. 14.1 % (95% CI -1.4, 29.7) respectively). 
For the RZB 1200 mg induction group, the response rate difference to PBO for the co-primary endpoint 
of clinical remission (SF/APS) was higher for the RZB 360 mg dose, 19.8% (95% CI 4.9, 34.7) vs. RZB 
180 mg, 14.0% (95% CI -0.3, 28.3). The response rate difference to PBO for the co-primary endpoint 
of endoscopic response was greater for the RZB 180 mg dose, 34.3% (95% CI 21.4, 47.2) vs. the RZB 
360 mg dose, 25.8% (95% CI 12.4, 39.3).  
On interpretation, the PBO (withdrawal) response rates are noted, as are the wide ranging CI and CI 
crossing unity reported.

Adolescent Subjects ≥ 16 to < 18 Years of Age at Week 52 
The adolescent population subset was small (n = 5), with 2 subjects in the RZB 360 mg arm, 2 in the 
RZB 180 arm mg, and 1 on PBO.  One (1/5) subject in the RZB 180 mg arm achieved the co-primary 
endpoints of clinical remission (per CDAI or SF/APS) and endoscopic response.  
No conclusions on the limited amount of data can be drawn.

Sub-Study 3 is ongoing.  On integration of Sub-Study 1 and available Sub-Study 3 observed data 
(ISE3A), the number of subjects who have completed to Week 104 is small, however trends in the 
proportion of subjects who achieved clinical remission (per CDAI or SF/APS) and clinical response (per 
CDAI or SF/APS) increased during the maintenance study and there is some evidence of maintenance 
of effect over time as per the following figures.

M15-991 
Design 
The study consists of a Screening Period (approximately 35 days), 12-Week 
Induction Period, Induction Period 2, and 20-week Follow-up Period. 
12-Week Induction Period is a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled IV therapy induction period.  Eligible subjects were randomized to 
risankizumab (RISA) 1200 mg IV, RISA 600 mg IV or placebo (PBO) in 
1:1:1 ratio through Week 12 and dosing in 12-Week Induction Period were 
at Week 0, Week 4, and Week 8. 
Induction Period 2 is a 12-week randomized, double-blinded, double-
dummy re-induction period for subjects who do not achieve clinical 
response at Week 12.  At Week 12, eligible subjects were re-randomized to 
receive RISA 1200 mg IV, RISA 360 mg IV or RISA 180 mg IV in 1:1:1 ratio

Summary of Efficacy for Study M16-006 (induction) 
Title:  A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Induction Study of the 
Efficacy and Safety of Risankizumab in Subjects with Moderately to Severely Active Crohn's 
Disease 
Study 
identifier 
M16-006 
Design 
The study consists of a Screening Period (approximately 35 days), 12-Week 
Induction Period, Induction Period 2, and 20-week Follow-up Period. 
12-Week Induction Period is a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled IV therapy induction period.  Eligible subjects were randomized to 
risankizumab (RISA) 1200 mg IV, RISA 600 mg IV or placebo (PBO) in 2:2:1 
ratio through Week 12 and dosing in 12-Week Induction Period were at 
Week 0, Week 4, and Week 8. 
Induction Period 2 is a 12-week randomized, double-blinded, double-dummy 
re-induction period for subjects who do not achieve clinical response at 
Week 12.  At Week 12, eligible subjects were re-randomized to receive RISA 
1200 mg IV, RISA 360 mg IV or RISA 180 mg IV in 1:1:1 ratio through 
Week 24, and subjects who received placebo induction treatment during the 
CHMP assessment report on group of extensions of marketing authorisation

2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The MAH has presented the clinical development program in support of the marketing authorization of 
risankizumab in patients 16 years and older who have moderately to severely active Crohn’s Disease 
(CD).  Risankizumab (RZB) has been investigated in two phase 2 studies (M15-993, M15-989) and 
three pivotal Phase 3 studies (M15-991, M16-006, M16-000, Sub-Study 1).  
The clinical development plan consists of a standard clinical package for a new product for the 
treatment of Crohn’s Disease, in line with the Guideline on the Development of New Medicinal Products 
for the Treatment of Crohn’s Disease (CPMP/EWP/2284/99 Rev. 2). The pivotal clinical studies are 
standard randomised controlled trials. The studies are agreed with respect to study design, duration, 
patient population, placebo comparator and clinical endpoints. The MAH received EU scientific advice 
which was followed in general or otherwise justified. 
The co-primary endpoints of clinical remission (SF/APS) and endoscopic response are justified as 
clinically relevant and of importance in providing an objective facet, reflective of developments in the 
scientific literature and clinical guidance regarding CD.   
The results of the Phase 2 dose-finding Study M15-993 (1311.6) indicated a dose dependent response, 
supporting the higher RZB dose (600 mg) for induction and at least a dose of RZB 180 mg SC for 
maintenance of effect but an upper dose-response limit, for induction or maintenance, was not 
deduced.  
Phase 2 study M15-989, (1311.20), an open label extension study was terminated by the sponsor so 
that subjects could roll over into Phase 3 Study M16-000 Sub-study 3 OLE, which is ongoing. The 
descriptive results supported the safety and tolerability of RZB 180 mg SC as a long term treatment in 
patients with moderately to severely active CD, who showed a clinical response, or remission, on 
previous treatment with RZB.  
Study M15-991 and Study M16-006 (induction studies) 
The Phase 3 induction studies (Study M15-991 and Study M16-006) were multi-centre, randomised, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluations of risankizumab (risankizumab 600 mg IV or 1200 mg IV 
at Weeks 0, 4, and 8) in subjects 16 years and older with moderately to severely active CD defined as 
a CDAI of 220 to 450, a daily average stool frequency (SF) of ≥ 4 and/or average daily abdominal pain 
score (APS) ≥2, and a Simple Endoscopic Score (SES) – CD (excluding the narrowing component) of ≥ 
6, or ≥ 4 for isolated ileal disease, confirmed by central review. 
Subjects with a SES-CD of ≥ 3 to < 6 for ileocolonic or colonic disease or SES-CD of 3 for isolated ileal 
disease while still meeting the symptomatic criteria for moderate-severe disease activity were enrolled 
as an exploratory population. This exploratory analyses in a limited subset of patients with SES-CD 
scores of 3, 4 or 5 is considered relevant to the wider CD population. 
The definition of moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease, the trial design and dosing regimens 
are considered acceptable to determine the efficacy of RZB as an induction therapy in CD. 
The co-primary endpoints were discussed under scientific advice and they are accepted as reflecting 
clinically important targets for the treatment of CD. The RZB induction studies also included a number 
of controlled secondary endpoints representing clinically meaningful parameters, including 
measurements of improvements in mucosal inflammation, including endoscopic response, endoscopic 
remission, and ulcer-free endoscopy and QoL.  
For both inductions studies no issues of concern were identified in relation to protocol amendments.  
However, the MAH was asked to provide more detailed discussion on protocol deviations and how it 
was concluded that there was no impact on the results, given the number and type described. The 
CHMP assessment report on group of extensions of marketing authorisation  
EMA/887275/2022  
Page 149/258 
 
 
 
 
MAH provided further clarity as requested and it is agreed that protocol deviations had no impact on 
study results.  
Induction Study M15-991 
Study M15-991 enrolled subjects who had a documented inadequate response or intolerance to use of 
an approved biologic agent (Bio-IR), such as infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, natalizumab, 
ustekinumab and/or vedolizumab.  The number of subjects with prior exposure to ustekinumab was 
capped at 20% of the total population. 
The baseline data presented by the MAH demonstrated that the study populations were well 
characterised in terms of disease extent, duration, disease activity and prior treatment. Patients were 
between 16-80 years. 4 patients in total were under 18 (i.e., either 16 or 17 years) with 2 patients 
under 18 treated in the RZB treated groups. 
The demographic and baseline disease characteristics for subjects were similar across the treatment 
groups in the induction study and are reflective of a subject population with moderately to severely 
active CD. In addition, there was good compliance with treatment, balanced across the groups. 
Use of any prior Crohn's disease related medication was reported by 100% of subjects. The most 
frequently reported prior CD-related medications used by the treatment groups were adalimumab 
(71.4% of subjects) and infliximab (65.2% of subjects). Patients had also exposure to vedolizumab 
(33.7%) and ustekinumab (20.4%). In general, the exposure to prior medications was balanced 
between all groups. 
This study recruited subjects with failure to prior biologic therapy and in the ITT1A group 47.1% had 1 
biologic failure with 52.9 experiencing >1 biologic failure. One subject in the 1200 mg IV group had 7 
prior failures and across all groups there were patients who had failed up to 5 prior therapies. 
The majority of subjects were recorded as having a loss of response or intolerance/medical 
complication to their therapy.  However, in number of instances the recorded reason of ‘other’ is high; 
notably Infliximab 18.5%, Adalimumab 29.0%, Vedolizumab 9.3%, Ustekinumab 8.1%. The high rate 
of ‘unknowns’ was addressed by the MAH and it is confirmed that the population in Study M15-991 is 
100% source verified as having IR to and/or intolerance to at least one prior biologic.  
The study met the co-primary endpoints of clinical remission and endoscopic response for the 
risankizumab 600 mg and 1200 mg arms compared to the placebo arm for both the US protocol and 
the OUS specific protocol. 
At Week 12 a statistically significant greater (p-value ≤ 0.001) proportion of subjects in the 
risankizumab 600 mg and risankizumab 1200 mg arms achieved the co-primary endpoint of clinical 
remission (defined by CDAI in the US protocol and by SF/APS in the OUS protocol) compared to 
placebo arm.  
At Week 12, a statistically significantly greater (p-value < 0.001) proportion of subjects in the 
risankizumab 600 mg and risankizumab 1200 mg arms achieved endoscopic response, assessed in 
both the US protocol and the OUS protocol, compared to the placebo arm. Overall, numerically similar 
results were observed for the risankizumab 600 mg arm and the risankizumab 1200 mg arm. 
For the key secondary endpoints (i.e., endpoints under the overall type I error control) for the OUS 
protocol both risankizumab arms (600 mg and 1200 mg) have clear treatment effect over placebo for 
resolution of clinical symptoms, improvements in quality of life (QoL), reduction in mucosal 
inflammation as measured by endoscopy, and CD-related hospitalizations.  
CHMP assessment report on group of extensions of marketing authorisation  
EMA/887275/2022  
Page 150/258 
 
 
 
 
A majority of endpoints were statistically significant for the risankizumab 600 mg arm and the 
risankizumab 1200 mg arm versus placebo and the overall efficacy rates for the risankizumab 600 mg 
and 1200 mg arms were numerically similar. 
Clinical response and clinical remission, as defined by CDAI and SF/APS, were seen at Week 4, with 
statistically significant differences observed for risankizumab 600 mg and 1200 mg arms versus 
placebo. Additionally, clinical response per CDAI and SF/APS were statistically significant for each 
risankizumab dose versus placebo at Week 12, with greater efficacy and treatment differences relative 
to those at Week 4.  
Other patient reported outcome (PRO) questionnaires that summarize QoL, such as Inflammatory 
Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ), Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-
Fatigue, and SF-36, showed overall numerically higher improvement in the risankizumab arms versus 
placebo and reached statistical significance. 
Endoscopic remission and ulcer-free endoscopy at Week 12 were statistically significant versus placebo 
in the OUS protocol. The composite endpoint for clinical response (per CDAI and SF/APS) and 
endoscopic response (i.e., clinical response and endoscopic response in the same patient), were also 
statistically significant for the risankizumab arms versus placebo. 
CD-related hospitalizations were lower in the risankizumab groups versus placebo and met statistical 
significance.  
For a number of parameters, namely the proportion of subjects with enhanced SF/APS clinical response 
at Week 4, the proportion of subjects with resolution of extra-intestinal manifestations (EIMs) at Week 
12, in subjects with any EIMs at Baseline, the proportion of subjects without draining fistulas at Week 
12 in subjects with draining fistulas at Baseline and the change from baseline in Work Productivity and 
Impairment Questionnaire – Crohn's disease (WPAI-CD) overall work impairment at Week 12 
significance was not meet versus placebo for either 600 mg IV or 1200 mg IV doses. In addition, the 
endpoint of change from baseline in 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) physical component 
summary score at Week 12 was not meet for subjects treated with the 600 mg IV dose. 
For the ITT2A population (these were subjects who did not achieve SF/APS clinical response at Week 
12, defined as a ≥ 30% decrease in average daily SF and/or ≥ 30% decrease in average daily AP score 
and both not worse than baseline), the proportion who achieved SF/APS clinical response at Week 
suggested a trend towards improvement in symptoms but no firm conclusions can be ascertained from 
this exploratory analysis. 
For the exploratory analysis in the ITT1B and ITT2B populations, i.e., those subjects who did not have 
baseline eligible SES-CD of ≥ 6 (≥ 4 for isolated ileal disease) there is a trend towards treatment 
benefit following RZB however the exploratory nature of these groups mean that no efficacy 
conclusions can be determined. 
Induction Study M16-006 
Study M16-006 enrolled subjects who were Bio-IR or subjects who were Non-Bio-IR. The non-bio-IR 
population included subjects who had an IR or intolerance to conventional therapy, but not biologic 
therapy. 
Conventional therapy was defined as one or more of the following: aminosalicylates, oral locally acting 
steroids (e.g., budesonide, beclomethasone), systemic corticosteroids (prednisone or equivalent), or 
immunomodulators. This population also included subjects who received biologic therapy in the past 
but stopped therapy based on reasons other than IR or intolerance (e.g., change in reimbursement 
coverage, well-controlled disease). The number of subjects with prior exposure to ustekinumab was 
capped at 20% of the total population. 
CHMP assessment report on group of extensions of marketing authorisation  
EMA/887275/2022  
Page 151/258 
 
 
 
 
The study populations were well characterised in terms of disease extent, duration, disease activity 
and prior treatment. Patients were between 16-79 years. Eight patients in total were under 18 (i.e., 
either 16 or 17 years) with 6 patients in the RZB treated groups. 
The demographic and baseline disease characteristics for subjects were similar across the treatment 
groups in the induction study and are reflective of a subject population with moderately to severely 
active CD. In addition, there was good compliance with treatment, balanced across the groups. 
Study M16-006 included both Bio-IR and non-Bio-IR patients. Of the 850 patients in the ITT1A group 
28.1% had 1 biologic failure with 29.6% experiencing >1 biologic failure. 42.2% of patients with no 
biologic failure. 
Of the subjects with >1 prior biologic failure most had failure to 2 agents with a small number of 
subjects having ≥ 4 (5.1%). Most common prior treatment was Infliximab (44.5%) followed by 
Adalimumab (40.0%), Vedolizumab (18.5%) and Ustekinumab (14.2%). 
RZB was superior to placebo, meeting the co-primary endpoints of clinical remission (SF/APS) (CDAI) 
and endoscopic response for the risankizumab 600 mg and 1200 mg IV arms compared to the placebo 
arm for both the US and the OUS protocols (P values < 0.001). 
In addition, a clear treatment effect was demonstrated in the key subgroup populations of non-Bio-IR 
and Bio-IR for all co-primary endpoints with numerically similar results were observed for the 
risankizumab 600 mg and 1200 mg IV arms. 
A majority of key secondary endpoints, including reduction in mucosal inflammation, resolution of 
clinical symptoms, improvements in QoL, and reduction in CD-related hospitalizations, under the 
overall Type I error control were statistically significant for both risankizumab arms versus placebo. 
The population for this study includes Bio-IR subjects and Non-Bio-IR subjects. The non-bio-IR 
population included subjects who had an IR or intolerance to conventional therapy, but not biologic 
therapy.   
There are improvements in responder rates observed whether, or not subjects had prior failure to 
biologic treatment across all co-primary endpoints. Although the data from the subgroups are not 
controlled for Type 1 error it is clear that there is a consistent pattern of effect in favour of treatment 
with RZB. 
The non-bio-IR population also included subjects who received biologic therapy in the past but stopped 
therapy based on reasons other than IR or intolerance (e.g., change in reimbursement coverage, well-
controlled disease). The MAH has provided results of an ad-hoc subgroup analysis which was 
conducted to compare the efficacy of subjects in the non-Bio-IR stratum with no prior exposure to 
biologics (i.e., bio-naïve; N=314) with the subjects in the total non-Bio-IR stratum (N=359). The 
results indicate a consistency in results for the efficacy endpoints of clinical remission and endoscopic 
response. Inclusion of subjects who received biologic therapy in the past but stopped therapy based on 
reasons other than IR or intolerance is unlikely to have any impact on observed efficacy results. 
The baseline characteristics were well balanced across all treatment arms in each population, there 
was no impact of non-Bio-IR nor Bio-IR subgroups on the overall efficacy. 
For the ITT2A population (these were subjects who did not achieve SF/APS clinical response at Week 
12, defined as a ≥ 30% decrease in average daily SF and/or ≥ 30% decrease in average daily AP score 
and both not worse than baseline), the proportion who achieved SF/APS clinical response at Week 24 
suggested a trend towards improvement in symptoms, but no firm conclusions can be ascertained from 
this exploratory analysis. 
CHMP assessment report on group of extensions of marketing authorisation  
EMA/887275/2022  
Page 152/258 
 
 
 
 
For the exploratory analysis in the ITT1B and ITT2B populations, i.e those subjects who did not have 
baseline eligible SES-CD of ≥ 6 (≥ 4 for isolated ileal disease) there is a trend towards treatment 
benefit following RZB however the exploratory nature of these groups mean that no efficacy 
conclusions can be determined. 
Choice of RZB 600 mg IV as the Induction Dose 
The co-primary endpoints in both induction studies were met for the two RZB doses investigated 
(600mg IV and 1200mg IV) and there did not appear to be any benefit for patients in receiving the 
higher dose.   
Across the range of ranked secondary endpoints, the 1200 mg IV dose performs marginally better in 
terms of statistical significance over placebo for a number of endpoints compared to 600 mg IV 
however, while it appears that there is no clear evidence of a benefit in terms of efficacy for either 
dose over the other. While there are slight differences in the point estimates for various endpoints 
between the risankizumab arms, the variability is within that expected in clinical trials, the 95% CIs 
are highly overlapping, and the totality of data does not indicate a dose-response and demonstrates a 
flat exposure-response relationship for the relevant clinical endpoints. 
M16-000 Sub-Study 1 (maintenance) 
This was a randomized, double blind, 52-Week study to assess the safety and efficacy of RZB for 
maintenance in moderately to severely active CD. The trial population, emanating from the induction 
studies M15-991 and M16-001, included a mixed population of approximately 75% Bio-IR and 25% 
non-BIO IR subjects. The baseline demographic and disease characteristics were similar to those 
reported in other studies for the condition under study. The population is accepted as representative of 
patients with moderate to severe CD requiring maintenance systemic therapy based on CD status, in 
the context of the proposed indication. 
The maintenance study endpoints, assessing clinical signs, symptoms, mucosal healing and QoL 
aspects of CD, were justified by the MAH. The co-primary endpoints were discussed under scientific 
advice; they are accepted as reflecting clinically important targets for symptomatic, clinical and 
endoscopic response to long term treatment. Achieving endoscopic endpoints has been associated with 
improved long-term outcomes.  
While the drug substance and drug product used in the pivotal trials are the to-be-marketed forms of 
RZB, the to-be-marketed SC presentation is an on-person device has not been studied at Phase 3. 
However, comparability data demonstrates that these products are comparable and no significant 
differences are expected to occur. 
Enrolment duration was extended to include up to 15% more subjects to mitigate against potential 
missed visits due the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, which is accepted. A slight imbalance in subject 
numbers per arm (placebo arm n=164/462; 35.5%) is not expected to influence results.   
No issues of concern were identified in relation to protocol amendments.   
Overall, superiority of RZB compared to PBO for maintenance treatment was seen for the co-primary 
endpoints at week 52. Patients in the RZB 360 mg arm demonstrated a statistically significant 
improvement in OUS (and US) co-primary data sets. The RZB 360 mg SC maintenance dose was 
statistically significantly superior to treatment with placebo over 52 weeks with regard to the co-
primary endpoints of clinical remission (SF/APS) and endoscopic response; the RZB 180 mg SC dose 
did not reach statistical significance.  
A strong placebo response in the randomised withdrawal arm is noted, with prolonged efficacy from 
induction, which was lost compared to treatments arms by week 52. This is most likely accounted for

by for by residual exposure from induction treatment lasting for approximately 16 to 24 weeks in Sub-
Study 1.  
The MAH stated that: “Each of the co-primary efficacy endpoints will be tested at two-sided 
significance level of 0.05 for 360 mg risankizumab SC dose versus placebo, followed by testing each of 
the co-primary endpoints at two-sided significance level of 0.05 for risankizumab 180 mg SC dose 
versus placebo. If both co-primary endpoints achieve statistical significance for both dose levels, 
continued testing of the ranked secondary endpoints for risankizumab SC 360 mg and 180 mg versus 
placebo will follow the multiplicity adjustment using graphic alpha spending methodology. The overall 
type I error rate of efficacy evaluation based on the co-primary and ranked secondary endpoints for 
the two doses will be strongly controlled at 0.05 (2-sided) level. Specifically, the testing will utilise the 
sequence of hypothesis testing for the co-primary endpoints for both doses, as stated above, followed 
by the ranked secondary endpoints in the order as specified in Section 3.1. If both co-primary 
endpoints for each dose achieve statistical significance in the hierarchical order specified above at 
alpha=0.05 (2-sided), continued testing will follow a prespecified weight of α allocation between the 
single hypothesis within the family, as well as between the families of hypotheses across the doses 
(denoted as node). [ SAP Risankizumab (ABBV-066) M16-000 Sub-Study 1 – Statistical Analysis Plan 
Version 2.0 – 30 April 2021]”

The acceptance of an initially raised ‘major objection’ relates to clarification of the multiplicity question. 
The reading of the above text in the SAP stated that both doses for both (co) primary endpoints should 
reach statistical significance, otherwise all secondary endpoints could not be tested, or considered as 
confirmatory. This was considered to be important as it is not the same as some secondary endpoints 
passing and others failing. The statistical evidence for all secondary endpoints failing to achieve type I 
error control, versus some secondary endpoints failing to achieving type I error control is important, 
CHMP assessment report on group of extensions of marketing authorisation  
EMA/887275/2022  
Page 154/258 
 
 
 
 
 
 
regardless of whether one or both doses passed. In this case, the MO was raised precisely because it 
was felt that not a single secondary efficacy endpoint could be considered as confirmatory, despite 
having nominal significance. The CHMP guidelines on multiplicity while acknowledging that secondary 
endpoints need not be subject to type I error control, also recognises that the evidence from these 
endpoints without type I error control may nevertheless be unreliable and could not normally be 
considered confirmatory. 
There is no question that the higher 360mg dose achieved clinical and statistical evidence for the co-
primary endpoint. The translation of the multiplicity rule as both DOSES and both co-primary endpoints 
requiring statistical significance was re-examined outside the context of the secondary endpoints 
testing. It was subsequently felt that based on statistical evidence, the higher dose of 360mg could be 
approvable based on the co-primary endpoints despite only nominal significance levels for all thirteen 
secondary endpoints. Consequently, the CHMP agrees to accept the 360 mg dose as a maintenance 
treatment in UC. 
While only nominally statistically significant, secondary endpoints on endoscopic results are supportive 
of the efficacy of RZB versus placebo and are clinically relevant. Evaluation of endoscopic endpoints 
(e.g., endoscopic remission, ulcer-free endoscopy, sustained endoscopic remission, deep remission) 
demonstrated a dose response, with the RZB 360 mg SC arm having higher efficacy than observed for 
the RZB 180 mg SC arm versus placebo. Relative rates of improvement in symptomatic endpoints were 
not demonstrably different between the treatment and PBO arms. Overall, the trends in non-significant 
secondary endpoints supported the 360 mg dose over the 180 mg dose.  
In addition, the MAH was asked to remove the text "or if such therapies are not advisable" from the 
indication as it was considered to be inappropriate/unnecessary. The revised indication, as proposed by 
the MAH which referred to “or have medical contraindications to such therapies” was also not agreed. 
The indication proposed by CHMP is sufficient to provide prescribers with the necessary information for 
the appropriate use of risankizumab, in the treatment of CD. The MAH agreed to update the indication 
to the following: 
“Skyrizi is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's 
disease who have had an inadequate response to, lost response to, or were intolerant to conventional 
therapy or a biologic therapy.” 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
The number of adolescent patients recruited to the Induction and maintenance studies was small 
(n=15 in total).  
No conclusions on the limited amount of data can be drawn. Therefore, as the Paediatric development 
which enrols patients from 2 years of age to 18 has been deferred until 2026, the indications should be 
restrict from 18 years of age.  
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The CHMP considers that the MAH has shown statistically significant effects for both co-primary 
endpoints for risankizumab 600 mg and 1200 mg arms (IV) compared to the placebo arm for induction 
of CD control. The MAH has also shown statistically significant effects for both co-primary endpoints for 
risankizumab 360 mg (SC) as a maintenance dosage. The primary endpoints were nominally supported 
by secondary endpoints. Statistical significance of the secondary endpoints is not considered an 
essential requirement to conclude an overall positive benefit/risk regarding the highest risankizumab 
dosage.  
CHMP assessment report on group of extensions of marketing authorisation  
EMA/887275/2022  
Page 155/258 
 
 
 
 
Therefore, the CHMP supports the proposed dose of 600 mg administered by intravenous infusion for 
induction, followed by 360 mgs administered by subcutaneous injection for maintenance. 
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
The clinical development program for risankizumab in Crohn’s disease included the following studies: 
-  One Phase 2 dose-ranging study M15-993  
-  One Phase 2 open label extension study M15-989  
- 
Two Phase 3 induction studies (Study M15-991 and Study M16-006) 
-  One Phase 3 randomized withdrawal maintenance study (Study M16-000) 
In addition, additional safety and tolerability data are provided from Phase 1 studies in healthy 
volunteers. 
- 
Four Phase 1 PK and safety studies of single IV or SC doses of risankizumab (Studies M16-533, 
M16-324, M17-381, and M19-128) 
-  One non-drug study (Study F20-282) assessed the effectiveness and tolerability of the 
adhesive for the on-body delivery system (OBDS) device (the intended delivery device for 
maintenance therapy) 
A total of 1,574 subjects received at least 1 dose of risankizumab in the global Phase 2 and Phase 3 CD 
studies, representing a total of 2,059.2 patient-years (PY) of risankizumab exposure. Of these 
subjects, 1,405 (89.3%) had exposure to risankizumab for at least 3 months, and 852 (54.1%) had 
exposure to risankizumab for at least 1 year. For the proposed to-be-marketed doses (which were 
based primarily on efficacy considerations), 620 subjects received at least 1 dose of risankizumab 600 
mg IV, and 233 subjects had exposure to risankizumab 360 mg SC for at least 1 year. 
The safety of risankizumab for both induction and maintenance treatment regimens were characterized 
based on a comprehensive evaluation of multiple analysis sets. The 3 primary analysis sets are 
summarised below: 
• 
The induction phase of treatment (Week 0 through Week 12).  
The Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction Period Safety Analysis Set provided an integrated 
safety assessment across the placebo-controlled 12-Week Induction Periods of the Phase 2 and 
Phase 3 studies. This analysis set provides a robust assessment of risankizumab induction 
treatment, where subjects received doses of risankizumab (600 or 1200 mg) administered by 
IV infusion 
• 
The maintenance phase of treatment (Week 0 of maintenance up to week 52).  
The Placebo-Controlled 52-Week Maintenance Period Safety Analysis Set provided safety 
information for subjects who were in the pivotal portion of the placebo-controlled randomized 
responder-withdrawal Phase 3 maintenance trial, Study M16-000 Sub-Study 1. This analysis 
set, a subset of the entire safety population of Study M16-000 Sub-Study 1 (denoted as SA1), 
contained safety data from subjects with clinical response to IV risankizumab induction who 
were randomized to risankizumab 180 mg or 360 mg SC doses or to a withdrawal (placebo SC) 
arm. This analysis set provided the most clinically relevant safety results for maintenance 
treatment with risankizumab as it is the only analysis set that aligns with treatment practice 
CHMP assessment report on group of extensions of marketing authorisation  
EMA/887275/2022  
Page 156/258 
 
 
 
 
 
(i.e., assessment of safety of maintenance treatment in subjects with clinical response to IV 
risankizumab induction). 
• 
The All Treated Safety Analysis Set  
This integrated set provided an integrated safety assessment for all subjects, both 
risankizumab-treated and placebo-treated (risankizumab naïve [up to the first dose of 
risankizumab]), across Phase 2 and 3 induction and maintenance studies; this analysis set 
provided the largest sample size and PY of exposure for the detection of uncommon and rare 
events across the entire CD program. This analysis set contains subgroups to further 
characterize safety, including the any risankizumab IV (ANY RZB IV) and any risankizumab SC 
(ANY RZB SC) groups to characterize safety for the IV and SC routes of administration of 
higher and lower doses, respectively; as well as the ANY RZB group, which includes the safety 
data for all subjects with any treatment of risankizumab. 
Table 48 Primary Safety Analysis Sets 
The treatment flow for the 3 primary analysis sets are summarised in the Figure 22.

Figure 22 Treatment Flow for Primary Analysis Sets 
In addition to the 3 primary analysis sets described above, 3 integrated analysis sets characterizing 
subsets of populations during the induction or maintenance periods are presented as supportive 
integrated safety analysis. These include: 
•  24-Week Induction Period Safety Analysis Set (M15-991 / M16-006 12-Week Induction Period, 
Induction Period 2) 
•  Maintenance Treatment Safety 1 Analysis Set (M16-000 Sub-Study 1, Sub-Study 3)  
•  Maintenance Treatment Safety Analysis Set 2 (M15-991 / M16-006 Induction Period 2; M16-
000 Sub-Study 1, Sub-Study 3)

Table 49 Supportive Integrated Analyses Sets 
The MAH provided comparison to data from Risankizumab Psoriasis 150 mg SC CCDS and referred to 
postmaketing safety data from the approved indications of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. 
The MAH has focused the Summary of Clinical Safety on pooled data and data analysed separately for 
3 primary analysis sets; The Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction Period Safety Analysis Set, The 
Placebo-Controlled 52-Week Maintenance Period Safety Analysis Set, The All Treated Safety Analysis 
Set. 
The primary safety analysis sets are considered broadly reasonable. The induction phase set integrates 
data from the induction phases of M15-991, M16-006 and M15-993, where patients received at least 
one dose of risankizumab of 600 or 1200 mg at 0,4 and 8 weeks administered by IV infusion (200mg 
IV dose from period 1 of M15-993 not included). Pooling of this dataset is considered appropriate and 
it is agreed that the population n=1629 provides for a robust characterisation of safety during 
induction treatment.  
The 52 week maintenance period analysis set includes all randomised subjects to M16-000 who 
received at least 1 dose of drug in sub study 1 (n= 542, of which n=179 subjects were randomised to 
risankizumab 180 mg SC, n=179 subjects to risankizumab 360 mg SC, and n=184 subjects to 
withdrawal [placebo SC] arm). This set includes subjects who had achieved SF/APS clinical response to 
IV risankizuma and who had previously received IV risankizumab induction. While the MAH outlines 
CHMP assessment report on group of extensions of marketing authorisation

this as the most clinically relevant in terms of characterisation of safety results for maintenance 
treatment with risankizumab, noteworthy in terms of the proposed to-be-marketed dose and device is 
the absence of any clinical safety data with the on-body delivery system, see discussion below and 
related MO. 
The all treated safety analysis set includes all subjects across the CD program and all treatment groups 
with extended exposure beyond Week 52. For subjects receiving placebo, events would be attributed 
to only placebo exposure (i.e., PBO IV/SC [RZB-naïve] subjects), until their first dose of risankizumab. 
A comparison of safety findings to the established safety profile from psoriasis clinical development 
programme as well as reference to post-marketing experience of safety is provided and of interest. 
Analysis of safety 
Treatment-emergent AEs are defined as events with onset after the first dose of study drug and within 
140 days after the last dose of study drug.  
Adverse events are coded using the MedDRA version 23.1, with the same version used for the pivotal 
study CSRs. Each AE is coded to a SOC and preferred term (PT). A subject with more than 1 AE for the 
same PT is counted only once for that term. Severity of the AEs was assessed using National Cancer 
Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria. All AEs presented in this section were treatment-
emergent, unless otherwise noted. 
Safety was evaluated by monitoring of AEs, including SAEs; evaluation of clinical laboratory values 
(hematology and clinical chemistry), and physical examination including vital signs. In addition to 
analysis of all treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs), Areas of Special Interest (ASI) were defined based on 
prevalence in the moderately to severely active CD population, customary concerns with injected 
immunoglobulin products, the immunomodulatory activity of risankizumab, or regulatory interest. 
These ASIs were identified using standard MedDRA queries (SMQ) and company MedDRA queries 
(CMQ). 
These ASIs included: 
• 
• 
adjudicated CV events (including MACE and extended MACE); 
infections (including serious infections, active TB, opportunistic infections [excluding TB and 
herpes zoster], and herpes zoster) 
•  malignancies (including malignant tumours, non-melanoma skin cancer [NMSC]), and 
malignant tumours (excluding NMSC) 
• 
• 
• 
• 
hypersensitivity reactions (including serious hypersensitivity reactions) and 
adjudicated anaphylactic reactions; 
hepatic events; 
injection site reactions (including infusion-related reactions). 
Real-world epidemiology data have been presented as reference benchmarks to contextualize the long-
term event rates of ASIs that are rare and of longer latency such as MACE and malignancies. 
To adjust for potentially different follow-up times between treatment groups, exposure-adjusted event 
rate (EAERs) and exposure-adjusted incidence rates (EAIRs) are provided for all AE tables from the 
integrated analysis sets. The EAER was generally used as the main approach when summarizing long-
term AEs, because they capture the complete event information during the entire follow up period. 
Exposure-adjusted incidence rates were summarized for AEs which typically occur as single instances 
or for composite endpoints of interrelated events (i.e., deaths, malignancies, and MACE).

For the Placebo-Controlled 52-Week Maintenance Period Safety Analysis Set and the All Treated Safety 
Analysis Set, AE summaries are descriptive and only raw percentages and rates are presented. To 
appropriately account for differences in study sizes, study-size adjusted (SSA) percentage and rate are 
provided in-text for the following integrated datasets: Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction Period 
Safety Analysis Set, 24-Week Induction Period Safety Analysis Set, and the Maintenance Treatment 
Safety 1 and 2 Analysis Sets. 
Subgroup analyses were conducted to evaluate whether demographic characteristics or disease 
characteristics factors had a differential effect on safety.

All Treated Safety Analysis Set 
The All Treated Safety Analysis Set includes data from all 1,574 subjects in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 
CD studies who received at least 1 dose of risankizumab for a median duration of 390.5 days and a 
total 2,059.2 PY of exposure. Of these subjects, 852 (54.1%) subjects had exposure to risankizumab 
for at least 1 year.

Subject Disposition 
12-Week Induction 
In the induction period (Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction Period Safety Analysis Set), 1,629 
subjects received at least 1 dose of study drug, with 1,197 subjects treated with risankizumab IV and 
432 subjects treated with placebo (Table 54). The percentage of subjects who discontinued study drug 
during the 12-Week Induction Period was 2.1% each in the risankizumab 600 mg and 1200 mg IV 
groups and 11.6% in the placebo group. Among the subjects who prematurely discontinued study 
drug, discontinuation due an AE was the most frequently reported primary reason for the Total RZB 
and placebo groups, with lower rates in the Total RZB group versus (vs.) placebo (1.0% vs. 6.5%, 
respectively). The most common AE leading to discontinuation of study drug in each treatment group 
was worsening of CD. A higher percentage of subjects in the placebo group (2.1%) compared with the 
Total RZB group (0.3%) reported lack of efficacy as the primary reason for premature discontinuation 
of study drug. No subjects discontinued due to COVID-19, while 2 subjects in the placebo group 
discontinued primarily due to COVID-19 logistical restrictions.

Maintenance up to 52 Weeks 
In the maintenance period (Placebo-Controlled 52-Week Maintenance Period Safety Analysis Set), 542 
subjects received at least 1 dose of study drug, with 358 subjects treated with either risankizumab 180 
mg or 360 mg SC and 184 subjects treated in the withdrawal (placebo SC) arm (Table 54). Fewer 
subjects discontinued study drug in either of the risankizumab treatment arms as compared to the 
withdrawal (placebo SC) arm. 
Across the study, lack of efficacy was the most frequently reported primary reason for discontinuation, 
with a higher percentage of subjects in the withdrawal (placebo SC) arm (6.0%) compared with the 
risankizumab 180 mg SC and 360 mg SC arms (1.7% and 3.4%, respectively) reporting lack of 
efficacy as the primary reason for premature discontinuation of study drug. No subjects in any 
treatment arms discontinued due to COVID-19 or COVID-19 logistical restrictions.

drug, adverse event was the most frequently reported primary reason for both the ANY RZB and 
placebo IV/SC (RZB-naïve) groups (4.3% and 7.9%, respectively). 
2.6.8.2.  Adverse events 
Percentage of subjects with AEs was lower in the risankizumab groups (53.9% in the risankizumab 600 
mg IV group, 54.4% in the risankizumab 1200 mg IV group) compared to the placebo group (61.4%) 
(Table 65). The rates of SAEs, severe AEs, and AEs leading to study drug discontinuation were lower in 
both risankizumab IV groups compared with the placebo group. One death was reported in the 
risankizumab 1200 mg IV group, and 2 deaths were reported in the placebo group (discussed further 
below). Overall, there was no apparent dose-relationship on AE rates between the 600 mg and 1200 
mg risankizumab IV doses (Table 56).

Maintenance up to 52 Weeks 
In the maintenance period (Placebo-Controlled 52-Week Maintenance Period Safety Analysis Set), the 
rate of AEs was similar between the two risankizumab arms (283.5 E/100 PY in the 180 mg SC arm 
and 269.3 E/100 PY in the 360 mg SC arm), indicating no dose-dependent pattern in overall AE rate, 
and similar to the withdrawal (placebo SC) arm (339.7 E/100 PY) (Table 57). The rates of SAEs and 
AEs leading to discontinuation were generally similar in risankizumab-treated subjects compared to the 
withdrawal (placebo SC) arm. There were no deaths during the 52-week maintenance period. 
All Treated Safety Analysis Set 
In the ANY RZB SC group of the All Treated Safety Analysis Set, the rate of AEs was 272.0 E/100 PY, 
the rate of SAEs was 18.1 E/100 PY, and the rate of AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug was 
3.7 E/100 PY. The rates of AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug, and deaths of the 
ANY RZB SC and the RZB 360 mg SC groups were similar to the corresponding rates observed in the 
Total RZB group of the Placebo-Controlled 52-Week Maintenance Period Safety Analysis Set. 
In the ANY RZB group, there were 4 deaths reported (detailed further below).

Common Adverse Events 
12-Week Induction 
In the induction period (Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction Period Safety Analysis Set), the most 
frequent AEs by SOC (≥ 14.0% of subjects) in all treatment groups were infections and infestations 
and gastrointestinal disorders, both of which occurred more frequently in the placebo group compared 
with the risankizumab 600 mg and 1200 mg IV groups. 
The most common AEs (≥ 5.0%) in any risankizumab treatment group were headache and 
nasopharyngitis, whereas the most common AEs in the placebo group were Crohn's disease, abdominal 
pain, nausea, and headache (Table 58). Overall, Crohn's disease (worsening of CD) was the most 
common AE in the placebo group and occurred more frequently than in either risankizumab group. The 
overall pattern of most commonly reported AEs was generally similar between the risankizumab 600 
mg and 1200 mg IV dosing groups.

Period Safety Analysis Set) 
Maintenance up to 52 Weeks 
In the maintenance period (Placebo-Controlled 52-Week Maintenance Period Safety Analysis Set), the 
SOC with the most frequently reported AEs was gastrointestinal disorders (35.8% in the risankizumab 
180 mg arm, 37.4% in the risankizumab 360 mg arm, and 40.8% in the withdrawal [placebo SC] 
arm). 
The most common AEs (≥ 5.0%) in any risankizumab arm of the Placebo-Controlled 52- Week 
Maintenance Period Safety Analysis Set were Crohn's disease, nasopharyngitis, arthralgia, headache, 
abdominal pain, anaemia, and nausea, whereas the most common AEs in the withdrawal (placebo SC) 
arm were Crohn's disease, nasopharyngitis, arthralgia, headache, abdominal pain, nausea, and 
diarrhoea (Table 59). Of the AEs reported in > 5.0% of subjects in the risankizumab arms, all were 
reported more frequently in the withdrawal (placebo SC) arm as compared to either risankizumab arm. 
The percentages of subjects (≥ 5.0%) with commonly reported AEs and the overall pattern of 
commonly reported AEs were generally comparable between the risankizumab 180 mg and 360 mg SC 
arms.

All Treated Safety Analysis Set 
The most common AEs (≥ 5%) in the ANY RZB SC group of the All Treated Safety Analysis Set were 
Crohn's disease, arthralgia, nasopharyngitis, headache, and abdominal pain. The overall pattern of the 
most frequently reported AEs in the ANY RZB SC group of the All Treated Safety Analysis Set was 
consistent with that of the Total RZB group of the Placebo-Controlled 52-Week Maintenance Period 
Safety Analysis Set (Table 59). 
TEAEs assessed as related 
12-Week Induction 
Across treatment groups in the Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction Period Safety Analysis Set, AEs 
assessed by the investigator as having a possible relationship to study drug were most frequently 
reported (≥ 3.5% in all treatment groups) in the SOCs of infections and infestations and skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders. The AEs most frequently assessed by the investigator as having a 
possible relationship to study drug in the Total RZB group (≥ 1.5%) were fatigue (2.1%), headache 
(1.9%), and arthralgia (1.5%). The AEs that were most frequently assessed by the investigator as 
having a possible relationship to study drug in the placebo group (≥ 1.5%) were Crohn's disease 
(2.4%) and headache (1.8%). 
The most frequent AEs considered by the investigators as having a reasonable possibility of being 
related to study drug were generally comparable among the placebo, risankizumab 600 mg IV, and 
risankizumab 1200 mg IV groups.

Across treatment arms in the maintenance period (Placebo-Controlled 52-Week Maintenance Period 
Safety Analysis Set), AEs assessed by the investigator as having a possible relationship to study drug 
were most frequently reported (≥ 5.0%) in the SOCs of gastrointestinal disorders, general disorders 
and administration site conditions, infections and infestations, and skin and subcutaneous tissue 
disorders. The AEs most frequently assessed by the investigator as having a possible relationship to 
study drug in the Total RZB group (≥ 2.0%) were injection site erythema (3.6%) and nasopharyngitis 
(2.2%). The AEs that were most frequently assessed by the investigators as having a possible 
relationship to study drug in the withdrawal (placebo SC) arm were Crohn's disease (3.3%), injection 
site erythema (2.2%), and arthralgia (2.2%). The most frequent AEs considered by the investigators 
as related to study drug were generally comparable among the withdrawal (placebo SC), risankizumab 
180 mg SC, and risankizumab 360 mg SC arms. 
All Treated Safety Analysis Set 
The most common AEs assessed by the investigator as having a possible relationship to study drug in 
the ANY RZB SC group of the All Treated Safety Analysis Set were consistent with those observed in 
the Total RZB group of the Placebo-Controlled 52-Week Maintenance Period Safety Analysis Set, both 
by SOC and PT. 
Severe TEAEs 
12-Week Induction 
In the induction period (Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction Period Safety Analysis Set), a higher 
percentage of subjects in the placebo group (11.2%) had severe AEs compared with the risankizumab 
600 mg and 1200 mg IV groups (5.0% and 5.2%, respectively). Severe AEs were most frequently 
reported in the SOC of gastrointestinal disorders (2.4% and 1.4%) in the risankizumab 600 mg and 
1200 mg IV groups, respectively. No individual severe AE was reported at a frequency ≥ 1.0% in 
either of the risankizumab treatment groups and the rates of severe AEs were generally comparable 
between the risankizumab 600 mg IV and 1200 mg IV groups. The most frequently reported severe 
AEs in the Total RZB group (≥ 0.5%) were anaemia (0.5%) and Crohn's disease (0.5%). The most 
frequently reported severe AEs in the placebo group (≥ 1.0%) were Crohn's disease (5.7%) and 
abdominal pain (1.2%), which are expected given the indication. 
Maintenance up to 52 Weeks  
In the maintenance period (Placebo-Controlled 52-Week Maintenance Period Safety Analysis Set), 
6.7%, 11.7%, and 12.5% of subjects in the risankizumab 180 mg SC, risankizumab 360 mg SC, and 
the withdrawal (placebo SC) arms, respectively, reported severe AEs. 
Severe AEs were most frequently reported (≥ 1.5% across treatment arms) in the SOCs of 
gastrointestinal disorders and infections and infestations. The most frequently reported (≥ 1.0%) 
severe AEs were anaemia (1.1%) and appendicitis (1.1%) in the risankizumab 180 mg SC arm, viral 
infection (1.7%), anaemia (1.1%), small intestinal obstruction (1.1%), and back pain (1.1%) in the 
risankizumab 360 mg SC arm, and Crohn's disease (2.2%) and abdominal pain (1.1%) in the 
withdrawal (placebo SC) arm. These events are either commonplace in the general population or 
expected in the indication. 
All Treated Safety Analysis Set 
The pattern of severe AEs in the ANY RZB SC group of the All Treated Safety Analysis Set was 
consistent with that observed in the Total RZB group of the Placebo-Controlled 52-Week Maintenance 
Period Safety Analysis Set, both by SOC and PT. 
Adverse Drug Reactions for Labeling 
CHMP assessment report on group of extensions of marketing authorisation  
EMA/887275/2022  
Page 174/258 
 
 
 
 
The ADRs for risankizumab were identified following the guidelines described in Council for 
International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) Working Groups III and V 'Guidelines for 
Preparing Core Clinical-Safety Information on Drugs' (CIOMS Working Groups III and V 1999). The AEs 
included in the submission safety data analysis sets were medically reviewed to determine the ADRs 
for risankizumab based on the totality of the data. A review of literature for background disease-
related events in moderately to severely active CD provided additional context. 
In general, the decision to consider an AE as an ADR was based on the totality and levels of evidence 
taking into account the following considerations: disproportionate number of reports between placebo 
and risankizumab, observed dose-related effect, consistency of the findings across studies, temporal 
relationship, dechallenge/rechallenge information for relevant event reports, preclinical data and 
biological plausibility based on mechanism of action and/or class effect. The identification of similar 
trends among medically related events was also a factor in classifying an AE as an ADR. Specifically, 
clinically related PTs were grouped and the disproportionality between risankizumab and placebo was 
assessed based on the grouped rates. 
All AEs by MedDRA coded PTs in the induction period (Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction Period 
Safety Analysis Set) and maintenance period (Placebo-Controlled 52-Week Maintenance Period Safety 
Analysis Set) were examined regardless of the investigator causality assessment. Adverse events that 
occurred in ≥ 1% of subjects in the risankizumab 600 mg IV group or risankizumab 360 mg SC arm 
and at a disproportionally higher rate compared to the respective placebo-treated subjects were 
identified. 
The body of evidence for AEs observed at a frequency of < 1% (uncommon and rare events) that were 
deemed events of medical importance (serious, fatal/life threatening) or AEs of safety interest was also 
reviewed. All AEs were examined by MedDRA SOC, SMQ, CMQ, and PTs. In addition, PTs were grouped 
according to medical concepts and clinical relevance post-hoc for further assessment when indicated. 
The frequencies of all currently labeled ADRs (using groupings of clinically related PTs) for the psoriasis 
program were reviewed against the frequencies observed in the CD development program. Further, 
dose-response across the 2 risankizumab IV doses (600 mg and 1200 mg) in the induction and the 2 
risankizumab SC doses (180 mg and 360 mg) in the maintenance period was taken into consideration 
for AEs in the ADR determination. 
For further assessment of ADRs, additional post-hoc analyses were conducted by grouping PTs 
representing similar medical concepts and identified in the Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction 
Period Safety Analysis Set and Placebo-Controlled 52-Week Maintenance Period Safety Analysis Set in 
the following areas: 
• 
Infusion-related reactions (PTs grouped: infusion-related reaction, infusion site bruising, 
infusion site cellulitis, infusion site erythema, infusion site extravasation, infusion site irritation, 
infusion site pain, infusion site swelling) 
• 
Lower respiratory infections (PTs grouped: bronchitis, pneumonia, pneumonia mycoplasmal, 
and tracheitis) 
•  Rash (PTs grouped: rash, rash erythematous, rash macular, rash maculopapular, rash pruritic, 
rash pustular, and rash vesicular) and 
•  Dermatitis (PTs grouped: dermatitis, dermatitis allergic, eczema). 
12-Week Induction 
Based on the comprehensive review of AEs in the Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction Period Safety 
Analysis Set as outlined above, no new ADRs were identified in the CD patient population . Among the 
CHMP assessment report on group of extensions of marketing authorisation  
EMA/887275/2022  
Page 175/258 
 
 
 
 
5 grouped ADRs in current product labeling, 2 grouped adverse reactions (upper respiratory infections 
and headache) occurred at a marginally higher rate in the risankizumab 600 mg IV group (10.2% for 
upper respiratory tract infection [URTI] and 6.5% for headache) and 1200 mg IV group (10.1% for 
upper respiratory infections and 5.2% for headache) than the placebo group (9.0% for upper 
respiratory infections and 5.1% for headache) during the 12-Week Induction Period of pooled induction 
studies and were determined to be ADRs for patients with moderate to severe CD during induction 
treatment. The non-grouped ADR event of folliculitis in the current product labeling remained as an 
ADR (0.2% in both risankizumab 600 mg and 1200 mg IV groups and 0% in placebo). For other ADRs 
listed in current product labeling (fatigue and tinea infections), rates for both risankizumab groups 
were similar compared to placebo. Rates for fatigue were 4.0%, 3.8% and 4.7% for the risankizumab 
600 mg IV, risankizumab 1200 mg IV, and placebo groups, respectively; rates for tinea infections were 
0.2%, 0% and 0.2%, respectively. Therefore, fatigue and tinea infections were not considered as ADRs 
for induction treatment. The 2 identified grouped ADRs, URTIs and headache in the placebo-controlled 
induction studies were observed at similar frequency categories as those in the psoriasis studies in the 
current labeling. The frequency categories for these 2 ADRs in the CD studies remained unchanged as 
currently listed ADRs (very common and common, respectively). 
Maintenance up to 52 Weeks 
Based on the comprehensive review of AEs in the Placebo-Controlled 52-Week Maintenance Period 
Safety Analysis Set, no new ADRs were identified. Among the 5 grouped ADRs listed in current product 
labeling, 3 grouped adverse reactions (fatigue, tinea infections, and ISRs), occurred at a rate ≥ 1% of 
subjects in the risankizumab arms, and at a higher rate than the withdrawal (placebo SC) arm during 
the 52-week maintenance period (Table 60). These 3 events were determined to be ADRs for patients 
with moderate to severe CD during maintenance treatment. The other 2 grouped events, upper 
respiratory tract infections and headache, were not considered as ADRs for maintenance as rates in the 
risankizumab arms were lower than those of the withdrawal (placebo SC) arm. The non-grouped event 
of folliculitis was not considered an ADR based on the assessment that 1 event each occurred in the 
risankizumab 180 mg SC and withdrawal (placebo SC) arms and no event occurred in the risankizumab 
360 mg SC arm. 
Three identified grouped ADRs, fatigue, ISRs, and tinea infections were observed at a rate ≥ 1% to < 
10% in the placebo-controlled maintenance study with risankizumab 360 mg SC (Table 60). The rates 
for these 3 ADRs in the CD studies were classified as a frequency category of common, the same 
frequency category as currently listed ADRs.

Table 60 Adverse Drug Reactions Occurring in ≥1% of Subjects in the Risankizumab 180 mg SC, 360 
mg SC, and Total RZB Arms with a Higher Rate than Withdrawal (Placebo SC) Arm (Placebo-Controlled 
52-Week Maintenance Period Safety Analysis Set) Compared to Data from the Risankizumab Psoriasis 
Program 
Although the rates of determined ADRs (clinically grouped PTs) in the Placebo-Controlled 12-Week 
Induction Period Safety Analysis Set and the Placebo-Controlled 52-Week Maintenance Period Safety 
Analysis Set appear to be numerically higher compared to the rates in the currently labeled ADRs, they 
continued to fall into the same frequency category as the current labeled ADRs from the psoriasis 
studies. Additionally, caution should be exercised when comparing ADR rates across indications, as 
studies were conducted in distinct patient populations and had different placebo-controlled treatment 
durations (16 weeks in psoriasis vs. 52 weeks in the CD maintenance study) and study designs. 
Furthermore, based on analyses of post-hoc data presented in Table 61, infusion-related reactions, 
lower respiratory tract infections, rash, and dermatitis do not warrant inclusion as ADRs, as the rates 
in the risankizumab IV groups and risankizumab SC arms were similar to the rates in the placebo 
group and the withdrawal (placebo SC) arm, respectively. Infusion-related reactions, particularly in the 
risankizumab 1200 mg IV group, were comprised of infusion site events rather than systemic 
manifestations of infusion-related reactions. 
Overall, no new adverse reactions were identified in risankizumab CD studies and the observed rates 
and severity of the currently labeled ADRs in the CD clinical studies were similar to the psoriasis clinical 
studies. This is reflected in the SmPC. The ADR profile observed in subjects with CD treated with 
risankizumab was consistent with the ADR profile observed in subjects with plaque psoriasis.

Table 61 Post-Hoc Analysis with Grouped Preferred Terms 
2.6.8.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
In the induction period (Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction Period Safety Analysis Set), the 
percentage of subjects with SAEs was similar between the risankizumab IV dose groups with no dose-
dependent pattern (6.5% in the 600 mg group and 4.0% in the 1200 mg group) and lower in both 
risankizumab IV dose groups compared with the placebo group (15.0%, Table 62 and Figure 23). This 
was driven by a higher proportion of subjects who reported SAEs attributable to the underlying disease 
(such as Crohn's disease, abdominal abscess, anal abscess) in the placebo arm. 
Figure 23 Cumulative Incidence Plot for Treatment-Emergent Serious Adverse Events (Placebo-
Controlled 12-Week Induction Period Safety Analysis Set) 
The most frequently reported SAE was Crohn's disease (0.8% in the Total RZB group and 8.9% in the 
placebo group), which, together with the other SAEs in the gastrointestinal disorders SOC, is likely 
attributable to the underlying disease (Table 62). Serious AEs in the infections and infestations SOC 
were reported at similar percentages in the risankizumab 600 mg IV group (0.9%) and risankizumab 
1200 mg IV group (0.7%) and were reported in a higher percentage in subjects in the placebo group 
(3.6%) (ASI discussion of serious infections).

The most frequently reported SAEs assessed by the investigator as having a possible relationship to 
study drug were anaemia in the risankizumab 1200 mg IV group (2 subjects [0.4%]) and Crohn's 
disease in the placebo group (7 subjects [1.4%]); all other SAEs in the above 2 treatment groups and 
all SAEs in the risankizumab 600 mg IV group that were assessed by the investigator as having a 
possible relationship to study drug were reported by 1 subject each. In the risankizumab 600 mg IV, 
risankizumab 1200 mg IV, and placebo groups, a total of 3 subjects (0.5%), 6 subjects (1.0%), and 28 
subjects (5.8%) discontinued study drug due to an SAE, respectively (Table 62).

Maintenance up to 52 Weeks 
In the maintenance period (Placebo-Controlled 52-Week Maintenance Period Safety Analysis Set), the 
percentage and rate of subjects with SAEs were similar in both risankizumab SC dose arms (12.3%, 
19.5 E/100 PY in the risankizumab 180 mg SC arm and 13.4%, 21.0 E/100 PY in the risankizumab 360 
mg SC arm) compared with the withdrawal (placebo SC) arm (12.5%, 19.3 E/100 PY), with no 
evidence of a dose response between the risankizumab 180 mg SC and 360 mg SC arms (Table 63). 
Serious adverse events were most frequently reported in the SOC of gastrointestinal disorders in both 
risankizumab SC arms and the withdrawal (placebo SC) arm. The most frequently reported SAEs in 
risankizumab-treated subjects were Crohn's disease (1.2 E/100 PY in both the risankizumab 180 mg 
and 360 mg SC arms), small intestinal obstruction (0.6 E/100 PY in the risankizumab 180 mg SC arm 
and 1.8 E/100 PY in the risankizumab 360 mg SC arm), and subileus (1.8 E/100 PY in the 
risankizumab 180 mg SC arm and 0.6 E/100 PY in the risankizumab 360 mg SC arm) (Table 63). All of 
these PTs are in the gastrointestinal disorder SOC and appear to be attributable to the underlying 
disease. Serious AEs of Crohn's disease occurred in a higher rate of subjects in the withdrawal (placebo 
SC) arm (2.5 E/100 PY). All SAEs assessed by the investigator as having a possible relationship to 
study drug were reported by 1 subject each . A total of 1 subject in the risankizumab 180 mg arm and 
4 subjects in the risankizumab 360 mg arm discontinued study drug due to an SAE.

Table 63 Treatment-Emergent Serious Adverse Events EAER per 100 PY Occurring in ≥2% Events in 
Any Treatment Arm (Placebo-Controlled 52-Week Maintenance Period Safety Analysis Set) 
All Treated Safety Analysis Set 
The overall SAE rate (18.1 E/100 PY) and types of SAEs in the ANY RZB SC group of the All Treated 
Safety Analysis Set were similar to those observed in the Total RZB group of the Placebo-Controlled 
52-Week Maintenance Period Safety Analysis Set (20.3 E/100 PY) (Table 63). The SAEs with the 
highest EAER in the ANY RZB SC group of the All Treated Safety Analysis Set were Crohn's disease (1.6 
E/100 PY) and small intestinal obstruction (0.8 E/100 PY). The EAER of SAEs with risankizumab 
treatment was stable, with no increased risk of experiencing an SAE with longer exposure. 
The cumulative incidence plot for SAEs in the All Treated Safety Analysis Set suggests that the risk of 
subjects experiencing SAEs on risankizumab remained constant over time. The number of subjects 
exposed to risankizumab at and after Week 144 is too small for any meaningful interpretation.

AEs in ASI 
12-Week Induction 
During the induction period (Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction Period Safety Analysis Set), the 
percentages and rates of AEs in the ASI categories, including hepatic events and hypersensitivity 
reactions, were generally comparable between the Total RZB and placebo groups, with similar 
percentages observed in the risankizumab 600 mg IV and 1200 mg IV groups (Table 64). Notable 
differences include a higher rate of serious infection reported in the placebo group and a numerically 
higher rate of ISRs in the risankizumab 1200 mg IV group as compared to the risankizumab 600 mg IV 
group.

The rates of AEs in the ASI categories in the ANY RZB SC group of the All Treated Safety Analysis Set 
were generally comparable to those of the Total RZB group of the Placebo-Controlled 52-Week

There were no adjudicated CV events reported during the induction period (Placebo-Controlled 12-
Week Induction Period Safety Analysis Set (Table 64). 
Maintenance up to 52 Weeks 
In the Placebo-Controlled 52-Week Maintenance Period Safety Analysis Set, 2 adjudicated MACE were 
reported, 1 non-fatal myocardial infarction in the risankizumab 360 mg SC arm in a 40-50-year-old 
subject with a history of dyslipidemia and long term smoker and 1 non-fatal stroke in the withdrawal 
(placebo SC) treatment arm (Table 66 and Table 67). The incidence rate of MACE in these 2 treatment 
arms was 0.6/100 PY. 
Table 66 Treatment-Emergent MACE (Placebo-Controlled 52-Week Maintenance Period Safety Analysis 
Set) 
All Treated Safety Analysis Set 
A total of 4 subjects in the ANY RZB group had an adjudicated MACE including 1 MACE of non-fatal 
myocardial infarction noted above. The additional 3 subjects had a MACE while on 180 mg 
risankizumab SC (1 subject during M16-000 Sub-Study 1, and 2 subjects during the Phase 3 OLE 
[Study M16-000 Sub-Study 3]). All of the subjects who had a MACE had CV risk factors or a history of 
CV disease. One fatal SAE of sudden cardiac death is detailed in Table 67. None of the non-fatal 
cardiac events led to study drug discontinuation. The incidence rate of MACE in the ANY RZB group was 
0.2/100 PY and was not higher than the background rate for this patient population based on published 
estimates. 
There were no additional cases of extended MACE.

Table 67 Listing of Subjects with Adjusted MACE in CD Studies 
There were no adjudicated CV events reported during the 12-Week Induction Period. 
Overall, 4 subjects treated with risankizumab and one subject in the withdrawal (placebo SC) group 
experienced adjudicated MACE, of whom all had known risk factors for MACE or a history of CV 
disease. The MACE incidence rate in the ANY RZB treatment group of the All Treated Safety Analysis 
Set (0.2/100 PY) was not higher than the background rate for this patient population based on 
published estimates (0.82/100 PY) (Kristensen 2013). Overall, the data did not suggest an increased 
risk of MACE with risankizumab treatment in subjects with CD. 
Infections (Including Serious Infections, Active TB, Opportunistic Infections [Excluding TB and Herpes 
Zoster], and Herpes Zoster) 
Overall and Serious Infections 
12-Week Induction 
In the induction period (Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction Period Safety Analysis Set), AEs in the 
infections and infestations SOC were reported at a lower percentage and rate among subjects in the 
risankizumab groups (19.2%, 83.3 E/100 PY in the 600 mg IV group and 18.3%, 95.6 E/100 PY in the 
1200 mg IV group, compared to subjects in the placebo group (24.4%, 117.7 E/100 PY). There was no 
evidence of dose effect, with similar percentages and rates of infection AEs reported in the 
risankizumab 600 mg IV and 1200 mg IV groups. The majority of infection AEs reported with 
risankizumab exposure were not serious were mild or moderate in severity, and none of the infection 
AEs led to discontinuation of study drug. The most common infections in the Total RZB group (≥ 1% of 
subjects) were nasopharyngitis (5.1%), upper respiratory tract infection (2.4%), influenza (1.1%), and 
urinary tract infection (1.0%). The most common infection AEs in the placebo group (≥ 1% of 
subjects) were nasopharyngitis (3.9%), sinusitis (1.7%), anal abscess (1.6%), gastroenteritis (1.5%), 
pneumonia (1.4%), upper respiratory tract infection (1.3%), and bronchitis (1.0%).

Table 68 Treatment-Emergent Serious Infections (Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction Period Safety 
Analysis Set) 
In the induction period (Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction Period Safety Analysis Set), serious 
infections were reported at a lower percentage and rate among subjects in the risankizumab groups 
(0.9%, 3.4 E/100 PY in the 600 mg IV group and 0.7%, 2.9 E/100 PY in the 1200 mg group [Table 68 
and Table 64]) compared to subjects in the placebo group (3.6%, 16.7 E/100 PY). The higher rate of 
serious infections in the placebo group was driven primarily by more events of gastrointestinal abscess. 
There was no evidence of dose-response, with similar percentages and rates of serious infections 
reported in the risankizumab 600 mg IV and 1200 mg IV groups. None of the serious infections 
reported in risankizumab subjects were reported in more than one subject and none led to 
discontinuation of study drug. One subject in the risankizumab 600 mg IV treatment group had an SAE 
of leptospirosis, which was moderate in severity, resulted in hospitalization/prolonged hospitalization, 
was considered by the investigator to have no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug. 
The subject had an occupation-related exposure to rodents. Study drug was not changed due to the 
infection. 
Maintenance up to 52 Weeks 
In the maintenance period (Placebo-Controlled 52-Week Maintenance Period Safety Analysis Set) the 
rate of infection-related AEs was lower in both risankizumab treatment arms (51.4 E/100 PY for 180 
mg SC, 57.7 E/100 PY for 360 mg SC) compared to the rate in the withdrawal (placebo SC) arm (76.0 
E/100 PY). The most common infection AEs in the Total RZB group (≥ 3% of subjects) were 
nasopharyngitis (12.5%) and upper respiratory tract infection (3.6%), while the most common 
infection AEs in the withdrawal (placebo SC) arm were nasopharyngitis (18.7%), URTI (4.4%), urinary 
tract infection (4.4%), gastroenteritis viral (3.7%), and influenza (3.7%). 
CHMP assessment report on group of extensions of marketing authorisation  
EMA/887275/2022

Most infection-related AEs reported with risankizumab exposure were not serious, were mild or 
moderate in severity, and few led to discontinuation of study drug. 
Treated Safety Analysis Set 
The rate of infection in the ANY RZB SC group was 56.6 E/100 PY (All Treated Safety Analysis Set), 
and similar to the rate of 54.5 E/100 PY in the Total RZB group of the Placebo-Controlled 52-Week 
Maintenance Period Safety Analysis Set. The majority of infection events in the ANY RZB group were 
non-serious, mild to moderate in severity, and few (3 events, 0.2%) led to discontinuation of study 
drug. 
Overall, the cumulative incidence plot shows the incidence of infection appeared to be higher during 
the early stages of treatment which is likely due to infections related to active underlying disease, with 
no apparent differences between risankizumab or placebo (Figure 25). The small denominators at later 
time points lend to wide variability in the event rates, reflected in this graph.  
Figure 25 Cumulative Incidence Plot for Treatment-Emergent Infections (All Treated Safety Analysis 
Set) 
Upper respiratory tract infections were among the most commonly reported types of infections, which 
was consistent with findings from a population-based epidemiological study in patients with CD. Upper 
respiratory tract infections (grouping of clinically related PTs) have been identified as ADRs from the 
psoriasis clinical development program and are listed in the current ADR table in the product label. 
Based on this review of both risankizumab IV doses in induction as well as both risankizumab SC doses 
in long-term maintenance therapy, no additional types of infection were identified as ADRs. 
Additionally, no meaningful change in frequency or severity of the currently known ADR for upper 
respiratory tract infections was identified. 
Opportunistic Infections Excluding TB and Herpes Zoster 
12-Week Induction 
In the induction period (Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction Period Safety Analysis Set), 
opportunistic infections were reported at a similar percentage and rate across treatment groups (0%, 0 
E/100 PY in the risankizumab 600 mg IV group, 0.2% [1 event] 0.6 E/100 PY in the risankizumab 1200 
mg IV group, and 0.5% [3 events] 2.0 E/100 PY in the placebo group) (Table 64).

The single opportunistic infection reported in the risankizumab 1200 mg IV group was CMV infection, 
which was reported on Day 15. After the database lock of Study M16-006, follow-up information 
confirmed the CMV was based on a biopsy obtained during Screening, and the subject was 
asymptomatic. The event was non-serious, moderate in severity, did not lead to discontinuation of 
study drug, was considered by the investigator to have no reasonable possibility of being related to 
study drug. The CMV infection occurred prior to receiving risankizumab and resolved after 22 days. 
Maintenance up to 52 Weeks 
In the maintenance period (Placebo-Controlled 52-Week Maintenance Period Safety Analysis Set) a 
single event of opportunistic infection was reported in each risankizumab treatment arm (Table 69). 
Both events were non-serious, mild in severity, and neither led to discontinuation of study drug nor 
were considered by the investigator to have a reasonable possibility of being related to study drug. 
Table 69 Treatment-Emergent Opportunistic Infection (Placebo-Controlled 52-Week Maintenance 
Period Safety Analysis Set) 
All Treated Safety Analysis Set 
The rate of opportunistic infection in the ANY RZB SC group was 0.5 E/100 PY (8 events, All Treated 
Safety Analysis Set), which was similar to the rate of the Total RZB group (0.6 E/100 PY) in the 
Placebo-Controlled 52-Week Maintenance Period Safety Analysis Set. Most events were non-serious, 
mild to moderate in severity, and none led to discontinuation of study drug. The most frequently 
reported opportunistic infection in this group was non-serious oral fungal infection (0.2 E/100 PY, 3 
events). 
The incidence rate of opportunistic infection in the ANY RZB SC group (0.5/100 PY) of the All Treated 
Safety Analysis Set was consistent with the background rate for this patient population based on 
published estimates. 
There were 3 SAEs of opportunistic infection in the ANY RZB group (detailed below) and 1 SAE in the 
placebo IV/SC (RZB-naïve) group (neutropenic sepsis): 
•  Disseminated histoplasmosis; A subject (Study M16-000 Sub-Study 1, a 20-30-year-old in the 
risankizumab 360 mg arm with steroid use (after tapering from 20 mg once a day [QD]) had 
an SAE of disseminated histoplasmosis (moderate in severity) on Day 460 (Day 369 of Sub-
Study 1; 29 days after the last dose of treatment). The diagnosis was based on the findings of 
a biopsy obtained from the Week 52 colonoscopy required by the protocol. The subject had no 
symptoms compatible with acute or chronic disseminated histoplasmosis, no cough, and no 
chest x-ray was performed. The blood fungal culture was negative and there were no skin 
lesion findings. Galactomannan antigen test result was borderline. The subject had previously 
received 12 weeks of risankizumab 600 mg IV for induction, was randomized to the 
risankizumab 360 mg SC arm in M16-000 Sub-Study 1, and on Day 278 received OL rescue 
with risankizumab (1 dose of risankizumab 1200 mg IV) and subsequently received 3 doses of

risankizumab 360 mg SC q8w) in Substudy 1. For context, disseminated histoplasmosis may 
present as acute infection or chronic infection. Patients with chronic infection often present 
with pancytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly and involvement of other sites including GI, skin, 
brain, and adrenal glands. Patients with acute infection present with fever, fatigue, in addition 
to manifestations above. However, in this case, the subject had no clinical symptoms 
compatible with acute or chronic disseminated histoplasmosis. Histoplasmosis in this case was 
diagnosed via intestinal biopsy performed during protocol guided colonoscopy. The event 
resolved with itraconazole therapy and did not lead to study drug discontinuation; it was 
assessed by the investigator as having a reasonable possibility of being related to study drug. 
•  Bronchopulmonary aspergillosis; A subject, a 60-70-year-old with history as a former short-
term smoker and asthma received placebo during the 12-Week Induction Period of Study M15-
991, followed by risankizumab 1200 mg IV in Induction Period 2 (subject received 3 IV doses 
but did not enroll in Study M16-000). The subject was on concomitant medication of 
methylprednisone 8 mg QD. On Day 167 (during the follow-up period of Induction Period 2), 
the subject experienced SAEs of staphylococcal pneumonia and acute kidney injury (both of 
which resolved after 18 days). On Day 189, the subject experienced a severe SAE of 
bronchopulmonary aspergillosis that resolved after 62 days and did not lead to study drug 
discontinuation. Both the investigator and sponsor consider the event to have a reasonable 
possibility of being related to study drug. 
•  Cytomegalovirus infection; A subject (Study M15-991), a 20-30-year-old with relevant medical 
history of CD, perirectal abscess drainage, and receiving concomitant methylprednisone 7.5 mg 
QD, experienced an SAE of CMV infection on Day 93. The subject received placebo IV during 
the 12-Week Induction Period, followed by risankizumab 1200 mg IV in Induction Period 2. An 
ileocolonoscopy was performed for the Week 12 visit (Day 85, prior to receiving study drug in 
Induction Period 2) as part of study activities and a rectal biopsy was performed. On Day 93 
the rectal biopsy was positive for CMV. The subject was afebrile and was admitted to the 
hospital to carry out IV antiviral therapy. The event resolved after 8 days and did not lead to 
study drug discontinuation. The investigator considered the event to have a reasonable 
possibility of being related to study drug but the sponsor considered the event to have no 
reasonable possibility of being related to study drug. The CMV infection was detected prior to 
the subject receiving their first dose of risankizumab. 
The cumulative incidence plot for treatment-emergent opportunistic infections in the All Treated Safety 
Analysis Set suggests that the risk of subjects experiencing an opportunistic infection on risankizumab 
remained stable up to Week 108; thereafter the sample sizes were too small for meaningful 
interpretation. 
During the induction period, no subjects developed opportunistic infection post-risankizumab exposure 
compared to 3 subjects in the placebo group. During the 52-week maintenance period, the event rates 
of opportunistic infection were the same between the risankizumab 180 mg SC and risankizumab 360 
mg SC treatment arms (0.6 E/100 PY) and no events were reported in the withdrawal (placebo SC) 
arm. The rate of opportunistic infection in the ANY RZB SC treatment group of the All Treated Safety 
Analysis Set (0.5 E/100 PY) was similar to that of the Total RZB group (0.6 E/100 PY) in the Placebo-
Controlled 52-Week Maintenance Period Safety Analysis Set. The incidence rate of opportunistic 
infection in the ANY RZB SC group (0.5/100 PY) of the All Treated Safety Analysis Set was consistent 
with the background rate for this patient population based on published estimates (0.80/100 PY) 
(Kirchgesner 2018). There was no specific pattern in type of pathogens observed. Overall, the data did 
not suggest an increased risk of opportunistic infection with risankizumab treatment in subjects with 
CD.

Active Tuberculosis 
12-Week Induction 
In the induction period (Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction Period Safety Analysis Set), 1 event 
(0.6 E/100 PY) of active TB was reported in the risankizumab 600 mg IV group and 1 event was 
reported in the placebo IV group (1.1 E/100 PY, Table 69). The subject in the risankizumab 600 mg IV 
group was a 40-50-year-old with a history of active TB that was previously treated with moxifloxacin, 
isoniazid, pyrazinamide, rifampicin, and ethambutol approximately 7 years prior to study entry. The 
subject had a positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold test and an episode of pyrexia during Screening. As the 
Screening chest x-ray was normal, active TB was ruled out by the investigator and no TB prophylaxis 
was initiated prior to the first dose of study drug. However, due to previous episodes of pyrexia, the 
subject underwent diagnostic workup. On Day 69, a bronchoalveolar lavage was performed and the 
results could not exclude TB; on the same day, the subject experienced a non-serious AE of pyrexia 
and was discontinued from the study after having received 3 risankizumab 600 mg IV doses. 
Subsequently, a non-serious AE of TB, confirmed via chest x-ray, was reported on Day 155 (Day 100 
of the follow-up period [which started on Day 56]). The event of active TB was considered by the 
investigator to have no reasonable possibility of being related to risankizumab. 
Maintenance up to 52 Weeks 
In the maintenance period (Placebo-Controlled 52-Week Maintenance Period Safety Analysis Set), 
there were no events of active TB reported in any treatment arm. 
All Treated Safety Analysis Set 
In the ANY RZB group (All Treated Safety Analysis Set), there was 1 additional case of active TB, which 
was reported in a 30-40-year-old subject with no history of active or latent TB and taking concomitant 
methotrexate. The subject received 600 mg IV during the 12-Week Induction Period in Study M15-991, 
then entered Study M16-000 Sub-Study 2 and received 1 dose of risankizumab 180 mg SC. On Day 
118, 28 days after the last dose of risankizumab 180 mg SC, the subject experienced an SAE of active 
TB. The subject had suspected contact with a TB-positive person, and the event led to discontinuation 
of study drug. 
The incidence rate of active TB for the ANY RZB group of the All Treated Safety Analysis Set was 
0.097/100 PY. 
Subjects with Latent TB With or Without Prophylaxis 
In the CD studies, subjects with latent TB were eligible for enrollment per local guidelines. If latent TB 
was established, TB prophylaxis was to be initiated and maintained according to local country 
guidelines although it was not mandated. Across the risankizumab CD clinical studies, 72 subjects with 
latent TB were concurrently treated with risankizumab and TB prophylaxis during the study and did not 
develop active TB during the mean treatment follow-up of 1.4 years; 55 subjects with latent TB who 
did not receive prophylaxis during the study did not develop active TB during the mean treatment 
follow-up of 2.0 years. 
Herpes Zoster 
12-Week Induction 
In the induction period (Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction Period Safety Analysis Set), herpes 
zoster was reported at a similar percentage and rate among subjects in the risankizumab groups 
CHMP assessment report on group of extensions of marketing authorisation  
EMA/887275/2022  
Page 190/258 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(0.3%, 1.2 E/100 PY in the 600 mg IV group and 0.2%, 0.6 E/100 PY in the 1200 mg IV group) and 
subjects in the placebo group (0.2%, 0.7 E/100 PY) (Table 64). All of the events of herpes zoster 
reported in risankizumab subjects were mild in severity and none led to discontinuation of study drug. 
Maintenance up to 52 Weeks 
In the maintenance period (Placebo-Controlled 52-Week Maintenance Period Safety Analysis Set), the 
rates of herpes zoster were similar across treatment arms, with1.2 E/100 PY [2 events], 0 events, and 
0.6 E/100 PY [1 event] reported in the risankizumab 180 mg SC, risankizumab 360 mg SC, and 
withdrawal (placebo SC) arms. Both events of herpes zoster in the risankizumab 180 mg SC arm were 
non-serious, mild to moderate in severity, and resolved. Neither event led to discontinuation of study 
drug. 
All Treated Safety Analysis Set 
The rate of herpes zoster in the ANY RZB SC group was 0.8 E/100 PY (12 events, All Treated Safety 
Analysis Set). None of the events were serious or led to study drug discontinuation and all events were 
mild to moderate in severity. The incidence rate of herpes zoster in the ANY RZB SC group of the All 
Treated Safety Analysis Set (0.8/100 PY) was similar to the expected range for this patient population 
based on published estimates (between 0.9 and 1.0 per 100 PY) (Sandborn 2021, Colombel 2017). 
Malignancies, NMSC, and Malignant Tumours Excluding NMSC 
12-Week Induction 
In the induction period (Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction Period Safety Analysis Set) there was 1 
event of malignancy (SAE of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung) reported in a subject in the 
risankizumab 1200 mg IV group (< 0.1% subjects, 0.4 E/100 PY, Table 68) that started on Day 8 and 
was not considered related to study drug by the investigator. 
Maintenance up to 52 Weeks 
In the maintenance period (Placebo-Controlled 52-Week Maintenance Period Safety Analysis Set), the 
incidence rates of malignancies were low (0.0/100 PY in the risankizumab 180 mg arm, 0.6/100 PY [1 
subject] in the 360 mg arm, and 0.6/100 PY [1 subject] in the withdrawal (placebo SC) arm). The 
subject in the risankizumab 360 mg arm had HER2-positive breast cancer, and the subject in the 
withdrawal (placebo SC) arm had basal cell carcinoma; both subjects had risk factors and the events 
were considered to have no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug by the investigator. 
All Treated Safety Analysis Set 
The incidence rates of malignancies in the ANY RZB SC and the ANY RZB groups in the All Treated 
Safety Analysis Set were 0.6/100 PY and 0.5/100 PY, respectively. There were a total of 12 events in 
the ANY RZB group reported in 11 subjects, of which 9 were serious (Table 70). 
Of note, a subject was a 30-40 year-old  who received 12 weeks of risankizumab 1200 mg IV for 
induction in Study M16-006, 52 weeks of risankizumab 180 mg SC in Study M16-000 Sub-Study 2, and 
continued receiving risankizumab 180 mg SC in Study M16-000 Sub-Study 3. The subject experienced 
a severe SAE of papillary thyroid cancer on Day 522 while in Study M16-000 Sub-Study 3. Risk factors 
included former long-term smoker and concurrent methotrexate use. Study drug was discontinued and 
the investigator considered the event to have a reasonable possibility of being related to study drug 
while the sponsor considered the event to have no reasonable possibility of being related to study 
drug. The event resolved with a thyroidectomy after 30 days. Among all subjects in the All Treated 
Safety Analysis Set, 3 subjects had a lung malignancy reported and 3 subjects experienced breast 
cancer. All risankizumab-treated subjects with malignancies had relevant risk factors (such as history 
CHMP assessment report on group of extensions of marketing authorisation  
EMA/887275/2022  
Page 191/258 
 
 
 
 
of tobacco use and family history of cancer) and/or the time to event onset suggested an incompatible 
temporal relationship with risankizumab therapy. 
The malignancy reports ranged from Study Days 8 to 2190. 
Table 70 Treatment-Emergent Malignancies EAIR per 100 PY by PT (All Treated Safety Analysis Set) 
The slope of the cumulative incidence plots for treatment-emergent malignancies excluding NMSC in 
the All Treated Safety Analysis Set indicated that the event rate was stable through Week 252 
(approximately 4.8 years). The apparent increase thereafter is due to a single report of melanoma out 
of 30 subjects leading to an approximate 3.4% increase from the 1.8% rate preceding that event. The 
small denominators at later time points lend to wide variability in the event rates. 
Figure 26 Cumulative Incidence Plot for Treatment-Emergent Malignant Tumours Excluding NMSC (All 
Treated Safety Analysis Set) 
In the All Treated Safety Analysis Set, the incidence rate of malignancy was 0.5/100 PY for the ANY 
RZB group, which was not higher than the background rate for this patient population based on 
published estimates (1.33/100 PY) (Taborelli 2020). All subjects who reported a malignancy had 
relevant risk factors and/or the time to event onset after the first dose of risankizumab suggested an 
incompatible temporal relationship with risankizumab. The types of malignancies reported in the CD 
program (i.e., breast and lung cancer) were consistent with the most common cancers reported in the 
CHMP assessment report on group of extensions of marketing authorisation  
EMA/887275/2022

general population (Ferlay 2021, Sung 2021) and do not suggest an increased risk of malignancies 
with risankizumab treatment. Based on the CD program data, no safety concern was identified with 
regards to malignancies in subjects with CD exposed to Risankizumab. 
Hepatic Disorder 
12-Week Induction 
Analysis of Hepatic Laboratory Data In the induction period (Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction 
Period Safety Analysis Set), the mean change from Baseline at Week 12 showed the following: an ALT 
increase of 4.1, 1.0, and 0.0 U/L; an AST increase of 3.0, 2.3, and 0.4 U/L; and a total bilirubin 
increase of 3.1, 3.1, and 1.9 μmol/L in the risankizumab 600 mg IV, risankizumab 1200 mg IV, and 
placebo IV groups, respectively. There were no dose-dependent increases in ALT, AST, or total bilirubin 
values. The mean changes in ALT and AST were not considered clinically meaningful, as small 
asymptomatic changes in ALT and AST of this magnitude are relatively common in the general 
population and seen in up to 50% of the IBD population (Dufour 2000, Klein 2020). 
Between Baseline and Week 12, the percentage of subjects with Grade 1 values in ALT and AST (> 
ULN to ≤ 3 × ULN) were similar across the treatment groups (Table 71).  The proportions of subjects 
meeting criteria for liver-related elevations (as defined in Table 71 with the exception of ALT/AST > 
ULN to ≤ 3 × ULN) in ALT, AST, total bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) values in the 
risankizumab 600 mg IV and 1200 mg IV treatment groups were low (< 2.5% for all criteria across the 
treatment groups). There was no meaningful difference between the risankizumab groups and the 
placebo group in the percentage of subjects with an ALT or AST ≥ 3 × ULN, ALT or AST ≥ 5 × ULN, 
ALT or AST ≥ 10 × ULN, or ALT or AST ≥ 20 × ULN. Across all categories of aminotransferase, ALP, 
and bilirubin elevations, no dose-effect was observed. 
Table 71 Summary of Subjects with Liver Tests Higher than Upper Limit of Normal During the Study 
(Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction Period Safety Analysis Set)

Among the Total RZB group, 5 subjects had an ALT elevation > 5 × ULN, and among these 5 subjects, 
3 subjects had a concurrent AST elevation > 5 × ULN (Table 71). No additional subject had an isolated 
AST elevation > 5 × ULN. Thus, 5 unique subjects in the Total RZB group (3 in the risankizumab 600 
mg IV group and 2 in the risankizumab 1200 mg IV group) of the Placebo-Controlled 12-Week 
Induction Period Safety Analysis Set had an ALT and/or AST elevation > 5 × ULN. Among these 5 
subjects with an ALT and/or AST elevation > 5 × ULN, 1 subject had an ALT ≥ 10 × ULN and 1 
additional subject had an ALT and AST ≥ 10 × ULN (as well as meeting the criteria for a potential Hy's 
law case). 
An additional 2 subjects had values meeting a potential Hy's law case. Subjects with ≥ 10 × ULN 
elevation in AST/ALT and/or potential Hy's law cases are presented below: 
Subjects with ALT and/or AST Elevations ≥ 10 × ULN: 
•  A subject (Study M16-006): a 30-40 year-old in the risankizumab 600 mg IV treatment group 
experienced an SAE of leptospirosis on Day 53. The subject was started on ciprofloxacin the 
same day. Two days later (Day 55), developed > 10 × ULN (Grade 3) ALT and Grade 3 AST 
elevations (ALT: 492 U/L; AST: 314 U/L) with marginally elevated total bilirubin (21 μmol/L, 
ULN 17 μmol/L). Of note, ALP remained normal during the event (55 U/L; range: 30 to 125 
U/L) and for subsequent risankizumab treatment. Ciprofloxacin was discontinued 2 days later 
CHMP assessment report on group of extensions of marketing authorisation  
EMA/887275/2022  
Page 194/258 
 
 
 
 
 
(Day 57), and meropenem followed by sultamicillin was initiated (Days 61 to 76). Total 
bilirubin returned to the normal range on Day 56 and the SAE of leptospirosis resolved on Day 
65, with normalization of ALT and AST on the same day. Study drug was not discontinued due 
to this event. Treatment with antibiotics, particularly ciprofloxacin, has been associated with 
serum enzyme elevations and acute liver injury (time to onset typically 2 days to 2 weeks). 
Leptospirosis infection can lead to multiple organ involvement including acute liver failure. 
Further, the normalization of liver enzymes in spite of ongoing risankizumab therapy does not 
support a causal association with risankizumab. 
•  A Subject with non-serious AE of rash on Day 55 
Subjects with Potential Hy's Law Cases: 
•  A subject (Study M16-006): a 60-70-year-old in the risankizumab 600 mg IV treatment group, 
with a non-serious viral infection diagnosed on Day 16, was initiated on amoxicillin-clavulanate 
(Days 23 through 27) and developed the following laboratory abnormalities on Day 28 (Week 
4): ALT 159 U/L (> 3 × ULN), AST 136 U/L (> 3 × ULN), Grade 3 total bilirubin 91 μmol/L (≥ 3 
× ULN), Grade 3 ALP (923 U/L, > 5 × ULN) and Grade 4 gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) 
(1092 U/L, > 20 × ULN). This subject was receiving concomitant medications of methotrexate 
and isoniazid (for TB prophylaxis; Days 1 through 36). All 3 drugs (amoxicillin-clavulanate, 
methotrexate, and isoniazid) are known to be associated with liver toxicity. The laboratory 
elevations were reported as non-serious AEs (mild blood ALP increased, moderate GGT 
increased, and severe drug-induced liver injury) and assessed by investigator as having no 
reasonable possibility of being related to study drug; the study drug dose was not changed. 
Repeat testing on Day 37, 10 days after amoxicillin-clavulanate was discontinued, showed 
decreases in these values, with AST in the normal range. On Day 56 (Week 8 assessment), 
ALT and total bilirubin also returned to normal, with GGT (178 U/L) and ALP (165 U/L) 
downtrending. Isoniazid was also discontinued. Given the confounding and positive dechallenge 
with known hepatotoxic medications (amoxicillin-clavulanate and isoniazid), this case was not 
judged to meet criteria for Hy's law. 
•  A subject (Study M15-991): a 40-50 year-old in the risankizumab 1200 mg IV treatment 
group, experienced an SAE of gastroenteritis Escherichia coli on Day 4 and the subject initiated 
treatment with paracetamol, hydrocodone/acetaminophen, ondansetron, 
piperacillin/tazobactam, morphine, and prochlorperazine. On the same day of diagnosis (Day 
4), laboratory abnormalities of AST > 3 × ULN and Grade 3 total bilirubin were measured 
(AST: 156 U/L and total bilirubin 82 μmol/L); the ALT value was 117 U/L. The elevations in 
AST and total bilirubin were not reported as AEs. On Day 6, the paracetamol and 
hydrocodone/acetaminophen were discontinued and AST and total bilirubin decreased (AST: 78 
U/L and total bilirubin: 34 μmol/L). On Day 30, AST and total bilirubin returned to normal 
range. Alkaline phosphate measurements remained within normal range and ALT never 
reached > 3 × ULN over the course of the other hepatic laboratory abnormalities. The study 
drug was not changed and the subject continued in study without further recurrence of liver 
test abnormalities in ALT, AST, or total bilirubin. This case was not judged to be a Hy's law 
case as positive dechallenge with paracetamol and acetaminophen, known hepatotoxic agents, 
provides the more likely alternative etiology. 
•  A subject (Study M16-006): a 30-40 year-old in the risankizumab 600 mg IV group with a 
history of hepatic steatosis and concomitant azathioprine (100 mg beginning on Day –567, 
with dose change to 125 mg on Day –202 and continuing to Day 80), developed a non-serious 
AE of rash on Day 55 and study drug was withdrawn (next scheduled dose was not given), with 
the last dose administered on Day 29. The rash resolved on its own after 7 days. On Day 80, 
CHMP assessment report on group of extensions of marketing authorisation  
EMA/887275/2022  
Page 195/258 
 
 
 
 
the subject developed an SAE of rash and was hospitalized; concomitant azathioprine was 
discontinued. On Day 82, the subject experienced an SAE of hepatic function abnormal with 
Grade 4 ALT (49.15 – 61.6 × ULN), AST (22.5 – 30 × ULN), and bilirubin (2.13 – 2.2 × ULN) 
elevations (ALP was normal at 114.67 U/L). The subject was treated with methylprednisolone 
(IV for 5 days, then oral administration) for the rash and medications for liver protection. 
Autoantibody testing was negative; liver biopsy was not performed. The ALT and AST rapidly 
declined over the next 3 days, and the total bilirubin also showed a decreasing trend. On Day 
87, the subject was discharged from the hospital and on Day 109, the AST and ALT returned to 
normal range. The event of hepatic function abnormal was considered by the investigator to 
have a reasonable possibility of being related to study drug. The delayed time to onset of liver 
enzyme elevation (7 weeks after last study drug dose) and the pattern of rapid resolution of 
liver enzymes in the setting of long half-life of study drug, is inconsistent with DILI and rather 
suggestive of an acute insult; consequently the details of this case do not support a causal 
association of study drug to the events. Therefore, this case was not judged to be a Hy's law 
case.

Analysis of Hepatic Events 
In the induction period (Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction Period Safety Analysis Set), hepatic 
events were reported at a similar percentage and rate among subjects in the risankizumab groups and 
subjects in the placebo group (1.6%, 8.5 E/100 PY in the risankizumab 600 mg IV group; 1.4%, 6.1 
E/100 PY in the risankizumab 1200 mg IV group; and 1.7%, 6.4 E/100 PY in the placebo group). The 
majority of hepatic events reported in the risankizumab groups were liver enzyme increases, non-
serious, mild to moderate in severity, and few events led to discontinuation of study drug (0.3% [2 
subjects]) in the 600 mg IV treatment group. 
A total of 2 subjects reported serious hepatic events: 
•  A subject  (Study M16-006) had an SAE of severe hepatic function abnormal; details on this 
case are presented above in the discussion on laboratory abnormalities meeting criteria for a 
potential Hy's law case. 
•  A subject (Study M16-006): a 50-60-year-old in the risankizumab 1200 mg IV treatment group 
taking concomitant azathioprine (Day –182 to Day 3) experienced an SAE of liver disorder 
(requiring hospitalization) on Day 57. Laboratory testing on Day 57 showed Grade 3 ALT (> 5 
× and < 10 × ULN), Grade 2 AST (> 3 × and < 5 × ULN) with total bilirubin in normal range, 
and ALP (> 2 × and < 3 × ULN). An abdominal ultrasound revealed steatosis and 
hemangioma. The investigator considered the event to have no reasonable possibility of being 
related to study drug and attributed to azathioprine taken prior to the event. Study drug was 
withheld but then continued without further recurrence. 
Additionally, 1 subject with a history of elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP, and GGT) in the 
risankizumab 600 mg IV treatment group discontinued study drug as a result of a non-serious hepatic 
event on Day 23 (AST increased, AST and ALT were 85 U/L and 65 U/L, respectively [Baseline ALT of 
91 U/L and AST of 53 U/L]. The event was moderate in severity, resolved, and was not considered to 
have a reasonable possibility of being related to study drug by the investigator. 
While the majority of the hepatic events were representative of laboratory abnormalities and are best 
assessed by the more comprehensive laboratory data, events reported or coded to the PT of DILI were 
assessed further and are presented below.

Two subjects in the risankizumab 600 mg IV arm had the AE of drug-induced liver injury (Table 72). 
The drug-induced liver injury has been described above in the discussion on laboratory abnormalities 
of ALT and/or AST ≥ 3 × ULN and TBL ≥ 2 × ULN. The drug-induced liver injury (reported term: drug 
hepatitis), who had no relevant medical history, occurred on Day 36 and was non-serious, moderate in 
severity, and considered by the investigator to have a reasonable possibility of being related to study 
drug. Alanine aminotransferase and AST were elevated (ALT: 168 U/L; AST: 89 U/L) on Day 36 but 
returned to normal by Day 57. Study drug dose was not changed and there was no further recurrence 
of hepatic events. Further details on these cases are provided in the Study M16-006 CSR.  
Table 72 Treatment-Emergent Hepatic Events (Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction Period Safety 
Analysis Set) 
Maintenance up to 52 Weeks 
Analysis of Hepatic Laboratory Data 
In the maintenance period (Placebo-Controlled 52-Week Maintenance Period Safety Analysis Set), the 
mean change from Baseline of induction at Week 52 showed the following: an ALT increase of 5.5, 7.1, 
and 3.8 U/L; an AST increase of 4.9, 6.6, and 4.5 U/L; and a total bilirubin increase of 3.9, 5.0, and 
3.3 μmol/L in the risankizumab 180 mg SC, risankizumab 360 mg SC, and withdrawal [placebo SC] 
arms, respectively. There were no dose-dependent increases in ALT, AST, or total bilirubin values 
among the treatment arms over time. The mean changes in ALT and AST were not considered clinically 
meaningful, as small asymptomatic changes in ALT and AST of this magnitude are relatively common 
in the general population and seen in up to 50% of the IBD population (Dufour 2000, Klein 2020). 
Between Week 0 and Week 52 of the maintenance period, the percentage of subjects with Grade 1 
values in ALT and AST (> ULN to ≤ 3 × ULN) were similar across treatment arms (Table 73). The 
proportions of subjects meeting criteria for liver-related elevations (as defined in Table 73 with the 
exception of ALT/AST > ULN to ≤ 3 × ULN) in ALT, AST, total bilirubin, and ALP values in the 
risankizumab 180 mg and 360 mg SC arms were low (< 3%, Table 73). There was no meaningful

difference between risankizumab arms and the withdrawal (placebo SC) arm in the percentage of 
subjects with an ALT or AST ≥ 3 × ULN or ALT or AST ≥ 5 × ULN. No subjects in the risankizumab 180 
mg SC arm had an ALT or AST value ≥ 5 × ULN or higher. Few subjects in the risankizumab 360 mg 
SC arm had an ALT elevation ≥ 5 × ULN (2 subjects) or AST elevation ≥ 5 × ULN (1 subject). None 
had concurrent AST and ALT elevations ≥ 5 × ULN or ALT and/or AST elevations > 10 × ULN. Of the 4 
subjects in the Total RZB group with ALT ≥ 3 × ULN, one discontinued study drug. 
There were no subjects who had ALT and/or AST ≥ 3 × ULN and TBL ≥ 2 × ULN across treatment 
groups in the 52-week maintenance period and no Hy's law cases were identified (Table 73).

Analysis of Hepatic Events 
In the maintenance period (Placebo-Controlled 52-Week Maintenance Period Safety Analysis Set), the 
rates of hepatic events were 4.7 E/100 PY in the risankizumab 180 mg SC arm, 5.4 E/100 PY in the 
risankizumab 360 mg SC arm, and 2.5 E/100 PY in the withdrawal (placebo SC) arm (Table 74). No 
dose dependency was observed for hepatic events. The majority of hepatic events were liver enzyme 
increases, none were serious or severe in severity, and only 1 subject discontinued study drug due to a 
hepatic event. The subject who discontinued study drug (also mentioned above) was in the 
risankizumab 180 mg SC arm and had 1 event of ALT increased of mild severity (was not associated 
with Grade 3 or above liver enzyme tests) with a concurrent moderate event of blood bilirubin 
increased; neither of the events were considered to have a reasonable possibility of being related to 
study drug.

Table 74 Treatment-Emergent Hepatic Events (Placebo-Controlled 52-Week Maintenance Period Safety 
Analysis Set) 
All Treated Safety Analysis Set 
Analysis of Hepatic Laboratory Data Across all risankizumab exposure (All Treated Safety Analysis Set), 
the proportions of subjects meeting criteria for liver-related elevations in ALT, AST, and total bilirubin 
values (as defined in Table 74 with the exception of ALT/AST > ULN to ≤ 3 × ULN) in the ANY RZB SC 
group were low (≤ 1.3%). 
Of the 8 subjects in the ANY RZB group with ALT elevation > 5 × ULN and 7 subjects in the ANY RZB 
group with AST elevation > 5 × ULN, 3 of the 15 subjects had concurrent AST and ALT elevations > 5 
× ULN. Thus, a total of 12 unique subjects in the All Treated Safety Analysis Set had an ALT and/or 
AST elevation > 5 × ULN.  
No additional subjects beyond those detailed in the 12-Week Induction section above had ALT and/or 
AST elevations ≥ 10 × ULN. The 3 subjects with ALT and/or AST ≥ 3 × ULN and TBL ≥ 2 × ULN 
(potential Hy's law) in the ANY RZB group of the All Treated Safety Analysis Set were detailed above in 
the 12-Week Induction Period section (Figure 30 and Figure 31). Overall, no confirmed Hy's law cases 
were identified.

Figure 30 eDISH Plot of Maximum Postbaseline Total Bilirubin Versus Maximum Postbaseline ALT (All 
Treated Safety Analysis Set) 
Analysis of Hepatic Events 
In the ANY RZB SC group of the All Treated Safety Analysis Set, the rate of hepatic events was 4.1 
E/100 PY, similar to the rate (5.1 E/100 PY) of the Total RZB group in the Placebo-Controlled 52-Week 
Maintenance Period Safety Analysis Set. The majority of hepatic events in the ANY RZB SC group were 
related to liver enzyme increases and are addressed above under laboratory data. The majority of 
hepatic events were non-serious and mild to moderate in severity, and only 1 subject discontinued 
study drug due to a hepatic event (< 0.1%). 
In the ANY RZB group, there were 2 serious hepatic events (one resulting in study drug discontinuation 
and the other resulting in study drug being withheld) and both are detailed in the 12-Week Induction 
section above. 
Two additional subjects discontinued study drug due to non-serious hepatic events, one of which is 
mentioned in the 12-Week Induction section and the other in the Maintenance section above. Overall, 
a total 3 subjects (0.2%) had hepatic events that led to discontinuation of study drug. 
Exploratory Cox proportional hazards models were run to assess treatment group and prespecified 
baseline predictors for treatment-emergent hepatic events. These were conducted for the Phase 3 
subset of the Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction Period Safety Analysis Set (data from Studies 
M15-991 and M16-006 only) and the entire All Treated Safety Analysis Set. No significant treatment 
effect was observed after adjustment for prespecified significant baseline predictors. 
The cumulative incidence plot for treatment-emergent hepatic events in the All Treated Safety Analysis 
Set suggests that the risk of subjects experiencing hepatic events on risankizumab remained constant 
over time. 
The small denominators at later time points lend to wide variability in the event rates. 
The assessment of cases with serious hepatic events, hepatic events leading to discontinuation, 
potential Hy's law cases, and those with PCS lab elevations were confounded with risk factors including 
concomitant use of hepatotoxic medications, alcohol use/abuse, and underlying disease such as 
hepatic steatosis.

Figure 31 Cumulative Incidence Plot for Treatment-Emergent Hepatic Events (All Treated Safety 
Analysis Set) 
No evidence of hepatotoxicity was observed with risankizumab administration in animal studies. In 
addition, there is no known mechanistic basis for interleukin (IL)-23 inhibition and drug-induced liver 
injury. 
Overall, in the risankizumab CD program, no clinically meaningful changes from Baseline were noted in 
either the induction or maintenance studies. Further, no dose-dependent increases in liver enzyme 
tests were observed across IV or SC risankizumab treatments. The majority of enzyme elevations were 
transient, resolved without any change to study drug, and were asymptomatic (i.e., not accompanied 
with abdominal pain, jaundice, etc.). The percentage of subjects with PCS laboratory values in ALT, 
AST, and total bilirubin values were low (< 3%). For subjects with aminotransferase elevations ≥ 5 × 
ULN, alternative etiologies or confounding factors were identified, or no clear causal association with 
risankizumab was determined. No confirmed Hy's law cases were identified. 
The majority of hepatic AEs were non-serious and related to liver enzyme increases, and 3 subjects 
(0.2%) in the ANY RZB group discontinued study drug due to a hepatic event. 
When considering the totality of the data, no risk of hepatoxicity with risankizumab administration in 
subjects with CD was observed. 
COVID-19 
The risk of SARS-COV-2 infection and severe outcomes associated with COVID-19 are not yet well 
characterized for the CD population. Current estimates are difficult to generalize because transmission 
and disease severity depend on key factors such as geography, distribution of SARS-COV-2, 
implementation of public health mitigation strategies, COVID-19 testing capacities, demographics, and 
underlying population health. COVID-19 cases were identified using search terms associated with 
COVID-19 (MedDRA SMQ Narrow). 
12-Week Induction 
During the induction period (Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction Period Safety Analysis Set), the 
percentage of subjects with COVID-19 related AEs was low in each treatment group (< 1%) and 
comparable between the risankizumab and placebo treatment groups (Table 56). There was one 
subject in the risankizumab 600 mg IV treatment group with a COVID-19 related, non-serious AE 
(COVID-19) that was mild in severity and resolved after 14 days. Study drug was temporarily

withdrawn and the event was considered by the investigator to have no reasonable possibility of being 
related to study drug. 
Maintenance up to 52 Weeks 
During the maintenance period (Placebo-Controlled 52-Week Maintenance Period Safety Analysis Set), 
the percentage of subjects with COVID-19 related AEs was low in each treatment arm (< 2.5%) and 
comparable between the treatment arms (Table 57). There were no deaths due to COVID-19 and the 
single COVID-19 related SAE (which required hospitalization) was mild in severity, did not require 
medical intervention, and did not lead to discontinuation of study drug. 
All Treated Safety Analysis Set 
Across the risankizumab CD program, 70 (4.4%) subjects in the ANY RZB group reported COVID-19 
related AEs (Table 75). There were no COVID-19 related deaths. There were 2 SAEs of COVID-19 in 
the ANY RZB group, one of which is detailed above in the Placebo-Controlled 52-Week Maintenance 
Period Safety Analysis Set. The additional subject had an SAE of COVID-19 on Day 578 in Study M16-
000 (Sub-Study 3) while in the risankizumab 180 mg SC treatment group. The event required 
hospitalization and the event was considered severe but did not lead to study discontinuation and 
resolved after 6 days. The investigator considered it to have reasonable possibility of being related to 
study drug, but the sponsor did not consider it to have reasonable possibility of being related to study 
drug as the subject had COVID-19 risk factors of obesity (body mass index [BMI] of 31.4 and former 
smoker (15 cigarettes/day for 19 years).

12-Week Induction 
Mean changes from Baseline in hematology parameters and clinical chemistry parameters (excluding 
liver function tests [LFTs]) in the Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction Period Safety Analysis Set 
were generally small and not considered to be clinically meaningful. There were no clinically relevant or 
dose-dependent trends in hematology or clinical chemistry parameters in any treatment group over 
time, with the exception of changes observed in platelet counts. Slight decreases in mean platelet 
counts were observed in the risankizumab 600 mg IV and 1200 mg IV groups, and mean platelet 
counts remained within the normal range. The decrease observed in mean platelet count likely reflects

Maintenance up to 52 Weeks 
Mean changes from Week 0 of Sub-Study 1 in hematology parameters and clinical chemistry 
parameters (excluding LFTs) in the maintenance period (Placebo-Controlled 52-Week Maintenance 
Period Safety Analysis Set) were generally small and not considered to be clinically meaningful. There 
were no clinically relevant or dose-dependent trends in hematology or clinical chemistry parameters in 
any treatment group over time, with the exception of changes observed in platelet counts. 
Clinical Chemistry Except LFTs 
12-Week Induction 
Shifts in clinical chemistry was evaluated for creatinine. Shifts in creatinine values from Grade 0, 1, or 
2 at Baseline to Grade 3 or higher during treatment were generally infrequent and no clinically 
meaningful differences were observed across treatment groups in the Placebo-Controlled 12-Week 
Induction Period Safety Analysis Set. 
Maintenance up to 52 Weeks 
Shifts in clinical chemistry (excluding LFT) values from Grade 0, 1, or 2 at Baseline of the induction

Clinically Significant Abnormalities 
12-Week Induction 
Rates of hematology values that met Grade 3 or Grade 4 criteria were low (< 3.5% for each parameter 
in each risankizumab group) and were generally similar across treatment groups in the Placebo-
Controlled 12-Week Induction Period Safety Analysis Set (Table 77). Four risankizumab-treated 
subjects had hematology values that met Grade 4 criteria. The subject with lymphocyte values that 
met Grade 4 criteria (on Days 58 and 85) also had lymphocytes values that met Grade 3 criteria at 
Screening, Baseline, and throughout the study. None of the abnormalities in hematology parameters 
that met Grade 4 criteria in risankizumab-treated subjects was reported as an AE or led to study drug 
discontinuation). 
Four subjects (0.3%) in the Total RZB group had Grade 3 values in neutrophils compared with no 
subjects in the placebo IV group (Table 77). Of these 4 subjects, a non-serious AE of neutropenia of 
moderate severity was reported on Day 92 (in the follow-up period) for 1 subject in the risankizumab 
600 mg IV group; the AE was assessed as having a reasonable possibility of being related to the study 
drug. 
Maintenance up to 52 Weeks 
Rates of hematology values that met Grade 3 or Grade 4 criteria were low (< 3.0% for each parameter 
in each risankizumab arm) and were similar across treatment arms in the Placebo-Controlled 52-Week 
Maintenance Period Safety Analysis Set (Table 78).

Among subjects in the risankizumab 180 mg and 360 mg SC arms, no Grade 3 hematology values in 
platelets, or Grade 4 values in hemoglobin, platelets, leukocytes, or lymphocytes were observed (Table 
78. Of the abnormalities in hematology reported as AEs in subjects in the risankizumab 180 mg and 
360 mg arms, the majority were assessed by the investigator as having no reasonable possibility of 
being related to study drug, and none of these AEs led to study drug discontinuation. One subject in 
the risankizumab 360 mg SC arm had a neutrophil value that met Grade 4 criteria at one time point; 
the abnormality (0.138 × 109) occurred on Day 343 and was not recorded as an AE. A repeat test 
taken 2 days later was normal.

Rates of chemistry values that met Grade 3 or Grade 4 criteria were low (< 2.0% for each parameter 
for each risankizumab group) and were similar across treatment groups in the Placebo-Controlled 12-
Week Induction Period Safety Analysis Set (Table 79). 
Two risankizumab-treated subjects in the risankizumab 600 mg IV group had chemistry values that 
met Grade 4 criteria. One subject had a Grade 4 value in potassium (hypo) that was reported as AEs of 
hypokalemia and hypophosphataemia, along with a concurrent AE of low magnesium; none of the AEs 
were considered to have a reasonable possibility of being related to study drug, and study drug was 
not discontinued. 
One subject had a Grade 4 value in triglycerides that was not reported as an AE.  
Fasting was not required prior to study visits. No Grade 4 values in glucose (hyper) were reported in 
any treatment group of the Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction Period Safety Analysis Set (Table 
79). The percentage of subjects with PCS values in glucose (hyper) in the Total RZB group (0.6%) was 
similar to that of subjects in the placebo IV group (1.0%). Of the 8 subjects in the Total RZB group 
with Grade 3 elevations in glucose, 6 subjects had relevant medical history (5 subjects with diabetes 
mellitus and 1 subject with type 1 diabetes), and 1 subject was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus 
during the study.

Maintenance up to 52 Weeks 
Rates of chemistry values that met Grade 3 or Grade 4 criteria were low (< 1.5% for each parameter 
in each risankizumab arm) and were similar across treatment arms in the Placebo-Controlled 52-Week 
Maintenance Period Safety Analysis Set (Table 80). 
A single subject in the risankizumab 360 mg arm had chemistry values that met Grade 4 criteria (Table 
80). The subject had increased triglycerides on Day 262 (Day 170 of Study M16-000 Sub-Study 1; 
12.52 mmol/L, Grade 4), Day 190 of Sub-Study 1 (8.45 mmol/L, Grade 3), and Day 282 of Sub-Study 
1 (16.25 mmol/L, Grade 4). A non-serious AE of blood triglycerides increased was reported on Day 172 
of Sub-Study 1 and assessed by the investigator of having no reasonable possibility of being related to 
study drug; the study dose was not changed. 
One additional subject in the risankizumab 180 mg SC arm had values that met Grade 3 criteria and 
was recorded as an AE. This subject had increased triglycerides at 2 different time points. The elevated 
triglyceride value at the first time point was recorded as a non-serious AE and assessed by the 
investigator having no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug; the study dose was not 
changed. 
No Grade 4 values in glucose (hyper) were reported in any treatment arm (Table 80). Two subjects in 
the risankizumab 360 mg SC arm, each with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, had Grade 3 
glucose values. The percentage of subjects with Grade 3 glucose values in the RZB group was the 
same as that of the withdrawal (placebo SC) arm (0.6%).

In Vital Signs, Physical Findings, and Other Observations Related to Safety 
During the induction period (Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction Period Safety Analysis Set), mean 
changes in vital sign parameters during risankizumab administration were not considered to be 
clinically meaningful and were comparable to changes observed in the placebo group. The proportion of 
subjects treated with risankizumab who experienced PCS vital sign abnormalities was low (≤ 2.4% in 
any treatment group for each parameter).  
In the Placebo-Controlled 52-Week Maintenance Period Safety Analysis Set, there were no clinically 
meaningful mean changes from Week 0 in vital sign parameters with risankizumab administration. The 
proportion of subjects treated with risankizumab who experienced PCS vital sign abnormalities was low 
(< 6.0% in any treatment arm for each parameter). 
Similar results were observed in the ANY RZB SC group of the All Treated Safety Analysis Set, in which 
< 6.0% of subjects had PCS vital sign abnormalities for each parameter. 
Safety from To-Be-Marketed Presentation On Body Delivery System 
Study M19-128  
The combination products used in the Phase 3 CD program are different vs. the planned to-be-
marketed combination products. Study M19-128 was conducted to bridge the Phase 3 and to-be-
marketed combination products for both induction and maintenance dosing. The main objective of 
Study M19-128 was to assess the bioequivalence of the Phase 3 CD drug presentations to the to-be-
marketed drug presentations in healthy volunteers. Additional objectives were to characterize the 
safety and tolerability of the to-be-marketed drug presentations with those used in the Phase 3 CD 
program. The study consisted of 2 sub-studies: Sub-Study 1 assessed the bioavailability (BA) of 
risankizumab 360 mg delivered by 4 SC injections of 90 mg in a PFS (1 mL, 90 mg/mL) (Phase 3 CD 
drug presentation) with a single SC injection of 360 mg via an OBDS (2.4 mL, 150 mg/mL) (to-be-
marketed drug presentation). Sub-Study 2 assessed the bioequivalence of 1800 mg risankizumab 
administered by IV infusion using 6 × 300 mg vial (3.33 mL, 90 mg/mL) (Phase 3 CD drug 
presentation) vs. 3 × 600 mg vial (10 mL, 60 mg/mL) (to-be-marketed drug presentation).  
Safety of Sub-Study 1 
In Sub-Study 1 evaluating PFS vs OBDS, higher rates of ISRs were reported in the to-be-marketed 
(risankizumab 360 mg OBDS) drug presentation (45/129 [34.9%] subjects) as compared to the Phase 
3 PFS drug presentation (11/127 [8.7%] subjects). All ISRs were mild in severity and a majority 
(87/100 [87%] events) resolved on the day of onset. The majority of ISRs in the risankizumab 360 mg 
OBDS arm were related to injection site erythema and/or injection site induration. The rates of ISRs 
observed in this study are likely due to the nature of Phase 1 study designs involving confinement and 
closer observation of healthy volunteers.

Table 81 Overview of Subjects with TEAEs (Substudy 1) 
The main SOC contributing the TEAEs across all groups were general disorders and administration site 
conditions (69/286, 24.1%) and a majority of TEAEs were ISRs. ISRs were reported at a higher rate in 
Group 2 (360 mg OBDS) and Group 3 (180 mg OBDS) versus Group 1 (90 mg PFS) with the most 
common PTs reported of "injection site induration" and "injection site erythema" (Table 82).

For the IV presentations, the safety and tolerability was similar between the Phase 3 CD (risankizumab 
300 mg, 90 mg/mL vial) and to-be-marketed (risankizumab 600 mg, 60 mg/mL vial) drug 
presentations.

Study F20-282  
Study F20-282 in healthy volunteers, which examined the effectiveness and tolerability of the adhesive 
for the OBDS device (the to-be-marketed combination product for maintenance therapy) demonstrated 
that the OBDS device was safe and well tolerated in both administration locations (abdomen and upper 
thigh). Overall, 2 subjects (2/36, 5.6%) who had the OBDS device applied to the abdomen reported

AEs. One subject experienced muscle spasms that were mild and assessed by the investigator as 
having no reasonable possibility of being related to the OBDS device. The other subject reported 
paraesthesia and warmth at the site of adhesive that were both mild and assessed by the investigator 
as having reasonable possibility of being related to the OBDS device. The reported AEs did not impact 
OBDS device adhesion to the skin. The skin assessment scale reported four subjects (4/36, 11%) who 
experienced erythema with a numeric score of 1, defined as minimal erythema, barely perceptible post 
device removal as measured by the FDA transdermal scale (Food and Drug Administration 2018). All 
product complaints associated with the OBDS device and procedure during the clinical study were 
reviewed and no new safety risks were identified. 
Studies Results from Supportive Analysis Sets and Phase 1 
Safety Results in Subjects with Delayed Clinical Response to Risankizumab IV 
Induction (24-Week Induction Period Safety Analysis Set) 
The main objective of this analysis set is to provide an evaluation of the safety of subjects who did not 
achieve clinical response to IV risankizumab treatment at completion of the 12-Week Induction Period 
and who were re-randomized in Induction Period 2 to receive risankizumab 1200 mg IV, 180 mg SC, or 
360 mg SC. This safety analysis set thus also includes subjects who received placebo IV during the 12-
Week Induction Period andrisankizumab 1200 mg IV during Induction Period 2 (Placebo IV/RZB IV) 
and subjects who received 24 weeks of risankizumab IV induction across both the 12-Week Induction 
Period and Induction Period 2. 
The percentages and rates of subjects with AEs, SAEs, severe AEs, and AEs leading to study drug 
discontinuation during Induction Period 2 (Table 86) were generally lower than those in the Placebo-
Controlled 12-Week Induction Period Safety Analysis Set (Table 56). One death occurred in Induction 
Period 2 in a subject in the risankizumab 1200 mg IV group; the primary cause of death was sepsis 
due to fistulizing CD with exacerbation. There was no apparent relationship between risankizumab SC 
dose and AE rates, and no specific patterns with regards to AEs were observed among risankizumab 
treatment groups. 
The percentages and rates AEs in the ASI categories during Induction Period 2 (Table 87) were 
generally comparable to those in the Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction Period Safety Analysis Set 
(Table 64). There was no apparent relationship between risankizumab SC dose and ASI rates, and no 
specific patterns with regards to ASIs were observed among risankizumab treatment groups. Four 
subjects in the risankizumab 1200 mg IV group had 6 hepatic events; all events were non-serious, 
mild or moderate in severity, and did not lead to study drug discontinuation. 
Continued treatment with risankizumab 180 mg SC, 360 mg SC, or 1200 mg IV for an additional 12 
weeks was generally safe and well tolerated. No new safety risks were identified with an additional 12 
weeks of induction treatment, and the overall safety profile was consistent with the safety profile of the 
12-Week Induction Period.

Safety Results in Maintenance Treatment Safety 1 Analysis Set 
This analysis set provides an analysis of the safety of risankizumab and placebo SC maintenance 
treatment among subjects who achieved clinical response to risankizumab IV or placebo IV at 
completion of the 12-Week Induction Period and received at least 1 dose of risankizumab or placebo in 
Study M16-000 Sub-Study 1. This set combines the safety from subjects who responded to IV 
risankizumab and were re-randomized to receive risankizumab 180 mg or 360 mg SC or placebo (i.e., 
the withdrawal [placebo SC] arm) with the safety of subjects who responded to IV placebo and 
continued to receive placebo SC during maintenance (i.e., RZB-naïve). 
Results from this analysis set were consistent with the primary safety analysis sets and no notable 
observations were reported. No increases in MACE, malignancies, or infections (including serious 
infections) were observed as compared to the All Treated Safety Analysis Set.

Safety Results in Maintenance Treatment Safety 2 Analysis Set 
This analysis set provides an analysis of the safety of risankizumab SC maintenance treatment among 
subjects with delayed clinical response to IV risankizumab (i.e., subjects who achieved clinical 
response to risankizumab SC at Week 24 of Induction) as well as subjects with clinical response to 
placebo IV induction who received placebo SC during maintenance treatment (i.e., RZB-naïve). 
Results from this analysis set were consistent with the primary safety analysis sets and no notable 
findings were observed. 
Additional Phase 1 and Non-Interventional Studies 
Results from additional healthy volunteer, Phase 1 PK and tolerability Studies M16-533, M16-324, and 
M17-381 were supportive of the conclusions presented in this CSS for the primary and secondary 
safety analysis sets. No safety concerns were identified. 
2.6.8.5.  Safety in special populations 
Age 
In the Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction Period Safety Analysis Set, there were 9 (0.8%) and 5 
(1.2%) subjects who were 16 to <18 years, 670 (56.0%) and 255 (59.0%) subjects between the ages 
of 18 and < 40, 463 (38.7%) and 150 (34.7%) subjects between the ages of 40 and < 65 years, and 
55 (4.6%) and 22 (5.1%) subjects ≥ 65 years of age, in the Total RZB and placebo groups, 
respectively (Table 59). There was no clear pattern with respect to age for any category of AEs or ASIs 
in the induction period (Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction Period Safety Analysis Set. Few subjects 
≥ 65 years of age reported AEs in ASI categories in any of the treatment groups. No subjects in the 
risankizumab 600 mg or 1200 mg IV groups < 18 years or ≥ 65 years of age reported infection-related 
AEs and the percentages of subjects reporting infection in subjects ≥ 18 and < 65 years of age were 
generally higher in the placebo IV group compared to the risankizumab IV groups and were 
comparable between the risankizumab IV groups. 
In the All Treated Safety Analysis Set, the ANY RZB group generally did not have any patterns with 
respect to age for any category of AEs or ASIs with the exception of subjects under 18 years of age 
who had a numerically higher AE rate overall than subjects above 18 years of age; however, fewer 
subjects account for greater variability and these differences should be interpreted with caution. Based 
on the totality data, no new safety findings were identified with regard to risankizumab use and age.  
Adolescent Subpopulation (16 to < 18 years old at time of induction Baseline visit)  
A total of 14 adolescents (4 subjects in the risankizumab 600 mg IV group, 5 subjects in the 
risankizumab 1200 mg IV group, and 5 subjects in the placebo group, respectively) enrolled in the 
induction period (Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction Period Safety Analysis Set) (Table 59). Three 
subjects (64.3%) in the risankizumab 600 mg IV treatment group and 2 subjects (51.8%) in the 
risankizumab 1200 mg IV treatment group reported AEs. Of subjects aged < 18 years in the 
risankizumab groups, none reported an SAE, severe AE, or an AE leading to discontinuation. There was 
no specific pattern with regard to the type of AEs reported by risankizumab-treated subjects under 18 
years of age. No subjects < 18 years in a risankizumab treatment group reported an AE in an ASI 
category. Twelve adolescent subjects received at least 1 dose of risankizumab across the CD studies. 
Of these, here were no events of an AE leading to discontinuation of study drug and few AEs were 
serious (23.8 E/100 PY [3 events]) or severe (23.8 E/100 PY [3 events]). 
Of the SAEs reported in the ANY RZB group (1 event of suicidal ideation and 1 event of Crohn's disease 
in the same subject, 1 event of ileal stenosis), none resulted in discontinuation of study drug and only 
CHMP assessment report on group of extensions of marketing authorisation  
EMA/887275/2022  
Page 220/258 
 
 
 
 
the event of ileal stenosis was ongoing as of the database lock. The subject with an event of suicidal 
ideation had an alternate cause listed as "social isolation resulted in increased sadness and anxiety 
which has led to suicidal ideation" and neither the investigator nor sponsor considered the event to 
have a reasonable possibility of being related to study drug. The event resolved in 1 day. The SAEs of 
ileal stenosis was also not considered by the investigator to have a reasonable possibility of being 
related to study drug while the SAE of Crohn's disease was considered by the investigator to have a 
reasonable possibility of being related to study drug. Overall, the safety profile in adolescent subjects 
was consistent with that observed in adult subjects and no dose related effects were observed. 
Sex 
The gender distribution in the Total RZB group of the Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction Period 
Safety Analysis Set was 52.3% male and 47.7% female and 49.1% male and 50.9% female in the 
placebo group (Table 59). In general, the percentage of female subjects reporting events across the 
categories of AEs (including infection AEs) and ASIs in the induction period was higher than the 
percentage of males across the risankizumab and placebo treatment groups and a similar trend was 
observed in the rates of AEs and ASIs in the ANY RZB group. Based on the totality of data, no new 
safety findings were identified with regard to risankizumab use and sex. 
Weight 
In the Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction Period Safety Analysis Set, in the Total RZB group, there 
were 352 subjects (29.4%) weighing < 60 kg and 845 subjects (70.6%) weighing ≥ 60 kg, compared 
to 134 subjects (31.0%) weighing < 60 kg and 298 subjects (69.0%) weighing ≥ 60 kg in the placebo 
group. In general, the percentage of subjects weighing < 60 kg reporting events across the categories 
of AEs and ASIs in the induction period was higher than the percentage of subjects weighing ≥ 60 kg 
across the risankizumab and placebo treatment groups, and this difference is likely a manifestation of 
the higher variability associated with fewer subjects. A similar trend was observed in the rates of AEs 
and ASIs by weight group in the ANY RZB group of the All Treated Safety Analysis Set. Based on the 
totality of data, no new safety findings were identified with regard to risankizumab use and weight. 
Race 
In the Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction Period Safety Analysis Set, there were 975 white subjects 
(81.5%) and 222 non-white subjects (18.5%) in the Total RZB group and 352 white subjects (81.5%) 
and 80 non-white subjects (18.5%) in the placebo group. In general, the percentage of white subjects 
reporting events across the categories of AEs and ASIs in the induction period was higher than the 
percentage of non-white subjects across the Total RZB and placebo groups. A similar trend was 
observed in the rates of AEs and ASIs with race in the ANY RZB group of the All Treated Safety 
Analysis Set. Based on the totality of data, no new safety findings were identified with regard to 
risankizumab use and race. 
Geographic Region 
The geographic regions with the highest subject enrolment in the Placebo-Controlled 12-Week 
Induction Period Safety Analysis Set were Western Europe and North America (approximately 30% of 
subjects each) (Table 59). There was no clear pattern with respect to the subject's geographic region 
for any category of AEs or ASIs in the induction period. Similarly, there was no clear pattern observed 
in the rates of AEs and ASIs in the ANY RZB group of the All Treated Safety Analysis Set. Based on the 
totality of data, there were no notable differences in types of AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to 
discontinuation, or AEs in ASI categories by geographic region and no new safety findings were 
identified with regard to risankizumab use and geographic region. 
Biologic therapy-intolerant or inadequate responder (BIO-IR) Status 
CHMP assessment report on group of extensions of marketing authorisation  
EMA/887275/2022  
Page 221/258 
 
 
 
 
In the Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction Period Safety Analysis Set, 71.5% of the subjects in the 
Total RZB group and 78.9% of the subjects in the placebo group were Bio-IR. There was no clear 
pattern with respect to Bio-IR status for any category of AEs or ASIs in the induction period In the 
Placebo-Controlled 52-Week Maintenance Period Safety Analysis Set, an examination of ASIs based on 
Bio-IR status revealed that the rate of serious infection was higher among Bio-IR subjects (9.2 E/100 
PY) in the risankizumab 360 mg SC arm vs. Non-Bio-IR subjects (0 events). A similar pattern was also 
observed in the withdrawal (placebo SC) arm in which the rate of serious infection was higher in Bio-IR 
subjects (6.2 E/100 PY) compared to Non-Bio-IR subjects (2.1 E/100 PY). 
However, in the risankizumab 180 mg SC arm, rate of serious infection was lower in Bio-IR subjects 
(1.7 E/100 PY) compared to Non-Bio-IR subjects (5.6 E/100 PY). Notably, the rate of serious infection 
in the Total RZB group (Bio-IR, 5.3 E/100 PY; Non-Bio-IR, 2.7 E/100 PY) was similar to that of the 
withdrawal (placebo SC) arm regardless of Bio-IR status, suggesting the inconsistent trend in the 
serious infection rates between Bio-IR and Non-Bio-IR subjects among the treatment groups may be 
attributed to the low number of events in general and the higher rate of serious infection observed in 
Bio-IR subjects in the risankizumab 360 mg SC arm was more likely due to Bio-IR status instead of 
attributable to risankizumab treatment. 
Among subjects in the ANY RZB group of the All Treated Safety Analysis Set, rates of AEs, SAEs, and 
AEs leading to study drug discontinuation were generally higher in the Bio-IR subgroup as compared to 
the Non-Bio-IR subgroup. For ASI categories, the rates of hypersensitivity were numerically higher in 
the Bio-IR (14.9 E/100 PY) vs. Non-Bio-IR (8.1 E/100 PY) subgroup. The same pattern was also 
observed in the placebo IV/SC (RZB naïve) group, in which the rate of hypersensitivity was higher in 
the Bio-IR subgroup (19.6 E/100 PY) compared to Non-Bio-IR subgroup (10.7 E/100 PY). Nevertheless, 
the rate of hypersensitivity in the ANY RZB group was lower as compared to the placebo IV/SC (RZB 
naïve) group in both Bio-IR and Non-Bio-IR subgroups. For the rest of ASIs, the rate was either 
generally similar or no meaningful comparison could be made due to low number of events between 
Bio-IR and Non-Bio-IR subjects. The rate of serious infections in the ANY RZB group was comparable 
between Bio-IR (3.7 E/100 PY) and Non-Bio-IR (3.1 E/100 PY) subjects, further suggesting there is no 
meaningful difference in the risk of experiencing serious infection with risankizumab treatment 
between Bio-IR and Non-Bio-IR populations. 
Number of Prior Biologics Failed 
In the Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction Period Safety Analysis Set, 34.7% and 36.5% of the 
subjects in the Total RZB group and 35.4% and 42.5% of the subjects in the placebo group had 
previously failed 1 or > 1 biologics. There was no clear pattern with respect to the number of prior 
biologics failed for any category of AEs or ASIs in the induction period nor was there a clear pattern 
observed in the rates of AEs and ASIs in the ANY RZB group of the All Treated Safety Analysis Set. 
Number of Prior Biolog Baseline Steroid Use  
In the Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction Period Safety Analysis Set, 32.6% of subjects in the Total 
RZB group and 33.8% of the subjects in the placebo group were on a concomitant corticosteroid at 
Baseline. There was no clear pattern with respect to baseline corticosteroid use for any category of AEs 
or ASIs in the induction period as compared to subjects who were not taking concomitant 
corticosteroids at Baseline. Similar findings were observed in the ANY RZB group of the All Treated 
Safety Analysis Set.  
Baseline Immunomodulator Use 
In the Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction Period Safety Analysis Set, 24.6% of the subjects in the 
Total RZB group and 25.7% of the subjects in the placebo group were on a concomitant 
immunomodulator (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate) at baseline. There was no clear 
CHMP assessment report on group of extensions of marketing authorisation

pattern with respect to baseline immunomodulator use for any category of AEs or ASIs in the induction 
period as compared to subjects who were not taking concomitant immunomodulators at Baseline. 
Similar findings were observed in the ANY RZB group of the All Treated Safety Analysis Set.  
Use in Pregnancy and Lactation  
Twenty maternal exposure pregnancies occurred in the risankizumab CD clinical development program 
through the cutoff date for this CSS 97. 
The pregnancy outcomes are shown in Table 88.  One elective termination with fetal defects occurredin 
a patient < 30 years old at 12 weeks gestation, due to a fetus with a cystic hygroma and fetal hydrops. 
The subject received risankizumab (180 mg SC Q8 weeks) for six months and then discontinued 
secondary to the pregnancy. The subject was exposed to risankizumab prior to conception and during 
the first trimester, and concomitant medications included nortriptyline, paracetamol, and desogestrel. 
Chromosomal analysis from chorionic villus sampling was normal, and human parvovirus testing was 
not suggestive of an acute infection. The event was assessed by the investigator with reasonable 
possibility of relationship to study drug. The sponsor assessed this event with no reasonable possibility 
of being related to risankizumab based on published data that IgG antibody is actively transported 
from mother to fetus via Fc receptors on the syncytiotrophoblast that appear after Week 14 of 
gestation and the active transportation of IgG antibodies starts in the second trimester, increasing 
throughout the third trimester. 
The absence of Fc-receptors in the first trimester indicates that the fetus in this period is not exposed 
to IgG class monoclonal antibodies during the period of organogenesis (between Weeks 3 and 8) and 
therefore the risk of mutagenic and teratogenic effects from maternal exposure to an IgG class 
antibody is negligible (Kane 2009, Ruiz 2014, Weber-Schoendorfer 2015). After discontinuation from 
Study M15-989, this subject experienced spontaneous abortion from a subsequent pregnancy almost 5 
months after last elective termination. 
Table 88 Summary of Pregnancies in Risankizumab CD Clinical Program 
Male subjects and their female partners were not required as per the protocols to use contraception. 
Risankizumab, an immunoglobulin, is not genotoxic and amounts in seminal fluid transferred to the 
conceptus are negligible. Consequently, male-mediated seminal transfer of large molecule drugs like 
risankizumab should not present a health risk to the female partner and the drug is not bioavailable to 
the developing conceptus (Scialli 2015). 
One paternal exposure pregnancy was reported in the partner of a male study subject in the 
risankizumab CD clinical development program. The pregnancy outcome for it is as follows: 
•  On risankizumab: 1 live birth without congenital anomaly

There are no data on the presence of risankizumab in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, 
or the effects on milk production. Although human IgG is secreted into human milk, published data 
suggest that antibodies in breast milk do not enter the neonatal and infant circulations in substantial 
amount. 
2.6.8.6.  Immunological events 
12-Week Induction 
No cases of adjudicated anaphylactic reactions were reported with risankizumab treatment during the 
induction period (Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction Period Safety Analysis Set). 
In the induction period (Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction Period Safety Analysis Set), 
hypersensitivity reaction was reported at a similar percentage and rate among subjects in the 
risankizumab and placebo groups (4.7%, 20.2 E/100 PY in the risankizumab 600 mg IV group, 5.3%, 
21.4 E/100 PY in the risankizumab 1200 mg IV group, and 4.3%, 21.8 E/100 PY in the placebo IV 
group) (Table 73). The majority of hypersensitivity reactions reported in the Total RZB group were 
non-serious, mild to moderate in severity, and few events (2 subjects, 0.3% in the 600 mg IV group 
and 4 subjects, 0.7% in the 1200 mg group) led to discontinuation of study drug. 
Two subjects in the risankizumab 1200 mg IV group had study drug withdrawn due to events of "drug 
hypersensitivity," both of which were non-serious and considered by the investigator to have a 
reasonable possibility of being related to study drug. 
A subject experienced a moderate AE reported as "allergic response to intraperitoneal (IP) medication" 
on Day 1 (same day of risankizumab administration), and a subject experienced a severe AE reported 
as "allergy on IP" on Day 29 (same day of risankizumab administration).  
Hypersensitivity reactions with PT of infusion-related reaction led to study drug discontinuation in 3 
subjects in the risankizumab arms. One subject in the risankizumab 1200 mg IV group had an 
infusion-related reaction of moderate severity on Day 6 and discontinued study drug. A subject, also in 
the risankizumab 1200 mg IV group, had an infusion-related reaction of moderate severity on Day 1 
and discontinued study drug. Both events were considered by the investigator to have a reasonable 
possibility of being related to study drug. One subject in the risankizumab 600 mg IV group had an 
infusion-related reaction of mild severity on Day 36 and discontinued study drug. The event was 
considered by the investigator to have a reasonable possibility of being related to study drug. Of note, 
infusion-related reactions were also reported in 3 subjects in the placebo IV group; for 2 subjects, 
study dose was not changed, and for 1 subject, study dose was interrupted. 
The single SAE in the risankizumab 600 mg IV group was previously described above. The subject 
developed a non-serious rash on Day 55 and study drug was withdrawn, with the last dose 
administered on Day 29. The rash resolved on its own after 7 days. On Day 80, the subject developed 
rash again and was hospitalized. The subject also had an SAE of hepatic function abnormal on Day 82 
with increased ALT, AST, and bilirubin. The SAE of rash was considered by the investigator to have a 
reasonable possibility of being related to study drug. The subject was treated with IV corticosteroids 
for the rash. Of note, one serious hypersensitivity event occurred in the placebo group.

Table 89 Treatment-Emergent Hypersensitivity Reactions (Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction 
Period Safety Analysis Set) 
Among the subjects who had anti-drug antibody (ADA) tests available in the Placebo-Controlled 12-
Week Induction Period Safety Analysis Set, the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions among ADA-
positive risankizumab-treated subjects was 7.7% (1/13 subjects, 1 subject with rash) in the 
risankizumab 600 mg IV group and 0% (0/4 subjects) in the risankizumab 1200 mg IV group. Among 
ADA-negative risankizumab-treated subjects, the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions was 4.7% 
(28/596 subjects) in the risankizumab 600 mg IV group and 5.0% (28/561 subjects) in the 
risankizumab 1200 mg IV group. The rash in the ADA-positive subject was mild and did not lead to 
study drug discontinuation. 
CHMP assessment report on group of extensions of marketing authorisation  
EMA/887275/2022  
Page 225/258 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
While recognizing that the number of ADA-positive subjects is low, these results suggest that 
immunogenicity to risankizumab did not have any clinically relevant impact on hypersensitivity 
reactions. 
Maintenance up to 52 Weeks 
In the maintenance period (Placebo-Controlled 52-Week Maintenance Period Safety Analysis Set), 
there were no adjudicated events of anaphylaxis and the rates of hypersensitivity reactions were 
similar across all treatment arms (12.4 E/100 PY in the risankizumab 180 mg SC arm, 12.6 E/100 PY 
in the risankizumab 360 mg SC arm, and 11.8 E/100 PY in the withdrawal (placebo SC) arm (Table 
90). All hypersensitivity reactions in the maintenance period were non-serious and mild to moderate in 
severity. A single event led to study drug discontinuation (urticaria in a subject in the withdrawal 
[placebo SC] treatment arm). 
Of the 4 ADA positive subjects in the risankizumab SC arms, one subject had a hypersensitivity 
reaction. A subject, <30 years-old in the risankizumab 180 mg SC arm who was also neutralizing 
antibody (NAb)-positive, experienced a mild AE of dermatitis on Day 183 (Day 15 of Sub-Study 1). The 
event did not lead to study drug discontinuation and was assessed by the investigator as having no 
reasonable possibility of being related to study drug. 
Table 90 Treatment-Emergent Hypersensitivity Reactions (Placebo-Controlled 52-Week Maintenance 
Period Safety Analysis Set) 
All Treated Safety Analysis Set 
No cases across the Phase 3 CD development program were adjudicated as anaphylactic reaction. 
The rate of hypersensitivity reaction in the ANY RZB SC group (All Treated Safety Analysis Set) was 9.8 
E/100 PY and similar to that of the Total RZB group 12.5 E/100 PY) of the Placebo-Controlled 52-Week 
Maintenance Period Safety Analysis Set (Table 74 and 90). The majority of events were non-serious 
and mild to moderate in severity. No hypersensitivity reaction events in the ANY RZB SC group (All 
CHMP assessment report on group of extensions of marketing authorisation  
EMA/887275/2022  
Page 226/258 
 
 
 
 
 
Treated Safety Analysis Set) led to discontinuation of study drug. A total of 3 serious hypersensitivity 
reaction events were reported in 2 subjects in the ANY RZB group of the All Treated Safety Analysis 
Set) (a case of serious rash [detailed in the 12-Week Induction section above] and a case with events 
of anaphylactic reaction and circulatory collapse). The SAEs of anaphylactic reaction and circulatory 
collapse occurred in the same subject and are summarized below: 
•  A subject, a 40-50 year-old in Phase 2 Study M15-993, experienced an SAE of circulatory 
collapse without loss of consciousness on Day 99 (when receiving OL risankizumab 600 mg IV). 
Study drug was not interrupted due to this event and no treatment medications were 
prescribed. The subject later entered OL Phase 2 Study M15-989 and received risankizumab 
180 mg SC. On Day 611, this subject experienced an SAE of anaphylactic reaction to IV 
Ferinject® administration within minutes of starting IV iron therapy. Study drug was not 
discontinued due to this event and the investigator did not consider the circulatory collapse nor 
the anaphylactic reaction events to have a reasonable possibility of being related to study 
drug. Both events resolved the same day. 
Adjudication results are not available as Phase 2 studies did not have an adjudication committee. 
Among the subjects in the ANY RZB group of the All Treated Safety Analysis Set who had ADA tests 
available, the incidence of hypersensitivity in ADA-positive subjects was 17.1% (6/35 subjects) 
compared to 11.1% in ADA-negative subjects (150/1349 subjects). The events in ADA positive 
subjects were generally mild (none were severe), with 1 event leading to study drug discontinuation. 
These results suggest that immunogenicity to risankizumab did not have a clinically relevant impact on 
hypersensitivity reactions. 
Considering hypersensitivity SMQ contains PTs covering broad medical concepts, post-hoc clinical 
grouping of events suggestive of rash and dermatitis and analysis were conducted. The results showed 
overall, the rates of rash and dermatitis were comparable between risankizumab arms and placebo. 
Exploratory Cox proportional hazards models were run to assess treatment group and prespecified 
baseline predictors for treatment-emergent hypersensitivity reactions. These were conducted for the 
Phase 3 subset of the Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction Period Safety Analysis Set (data from 
Studies M15-991 and M16-006 only) and the entire All Treated Safety Analysis Set. No significant 
treatment effect was observed after adjustment for prespecified significant baseline predictors. 
The cumulative incidence plot for treatment-emergent hypersensitivity reaction in the All Treated 
Safety Analysis Set suggests that the risk of subjects experiencing hypersensitivity reaction on 
risankizumab remained constant over time. The small denominators at later time points lend to wide 
variability in the event rates. 
While the rates of hypersensitivity reactions were similar between the risankizumab and placebo 
groups in the Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction Period Safety Analysis Set, it is noted that 3 
patients discontinued due to hypersensitivity infusion-related reactions. One subject in the 
risankizumab 1200 mg IV group had an infusion-related reaction of moderate severity on Day 6 and 
discontinued study drug. A subject also in the risankizumabtable 1200 mg IV group, had an infusion-
related reaction of moderate severity on Day 1 and discontinued study drug. Both events were 
considered by the investigator to have a reasonable possibility of being related to study drug. One 
subject in the risankizumab 600 mg IV group had an infusion-related reaction of mild severity on Day 
36 and discontinued study drug. It is noted that infusion reactions is not listed section 4.8 of the 
SmPC. Infusion reactions are discussed further below. The MAH was requested to outline the rationale 
for not including infusion as an adverse reactions. In response, the MAH presented the number and 
percentage of subjects with TEAEs by infusion reaction in the placebo controlled 12 week induction 
period safety analysis set. It is agreed that given reported infusion-related reactions were observed in 
CHMP assessment report on group of extensions of marketing authorisation  
EMA/887275/2022

both risankizumab and placebo treatment arms, the rarity of occurrence and lack of a dose-dependent 
pattern, the totality of data do not point to a causal association with risankizumab treatment. 
Serious hypersensitivity reactions are listed as an important potential risk with and evaluation of the 
rates of serious hypersensitivity reactions is an objective of the proposed long term cohort study listed 
as additional pharmacovigilance activities. 
In the Placebo-Controlled 52-Week Maintenance Period Safety Analysis Set the event rates of 
hypersensitivity reactions were similar across the treatment arms with 12.4 E/100 PY, 12.6 E/100 PY, 
and 11.8 E/100 PY reported for the risankizumab180 mg SC, risankizumab 360 mg SC, and withdrawal 
(placebo SC) arms, respectively. No serious hypersensitivity reactions were reported.  
The rate of serious hypersensitivity reactions across any risankizumab exposure (<0.1 E/100 PY) was 
low. 
Immunogenicity to risankizumab did not appear to have any clinically relevant impacts on 
hypersensitivity reactions, though the low number of patient’s experiencing ADA precludes any 
conclusions in this regard.  
2.6.8.7.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The potential for drug-drug interactions between risankizumab and CYP450 enzyme activity, including 
CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A using their probe substrates was assessed in the 
Phase 1 Study M16-007 (1311.36) in subjects with plaque psoriasis which was included and reviewed 
previously in the risankizumab application for psoriasis. No clinically significant changes in exposure of 
probe substrates were observed when used concomitantly with risankizumab in subjects with plaque 
psoriasis. 
2.6.8.8.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
12-Week Induction 
In the induction period (Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction Period Safety Analysis Set), a lower 
percentage of subjects discontinued from study drug due to an AE in the risankizumab 600 mg and 
1200 mg IV groups (2.0% and 2.1%, respectively) compared with the placebo group (8.2%), with no 
dose-response between the 2 risankizumab IV dose groups (Table 91). The most common AE leading 
to discontinuation of study drug in any treatment group was worsening of the underlying disease 
(Crohn's disease), which was higher in the placebo group (risankizumab 600 mg: 0.5%; risankizumab 
1200 mg: 0.5%; placebo: 5.0%). Eight subjects (1.9%) in the placebo group discontinued study drug 
due to an AE in the SOC of infections and infestations while no subjects in either risankizumab group 
discontinued study drug due to an AE in the SOC of infections and infestations.

Table 91 TEAEs Leading to Discontinuation of Study Drug in ≥1 Subject in Any Risankizumab Group 
(Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction Period Safety Analysis Set) 
In the 12-week Induction Period safety analysis set, TEAEs leading to discontinuations were 4 times 
higher in the placebo IV group (8.6%) when compared to the treatment groups (2.1% for 600mg IV 
and 2.1 for 1200 mg IV group). The imbalance is predominantly driven by AEs in the GI disorder SOC 
CHMP assessment report on group of extensions of marketing authorisation

Page 229/258 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and those associated with the underlying disease. The MAH was requested to provide the narrative for 
the event of systemic inflammatory response syndrome.  
TEAEs which led to treatment discontinuation were similar for 360mg sc group (3.4%) and 
placebo/withdrawal group (3.3%) of the placebo-Controlled 52-Week Maintenance Period Safety 
Analysis Set), though TEAEs which led to discontinuations were lower in the 10 mg sc group (1.7%) 
due to a lack of GI disorder TEAEs leading to discontinuation in this group. 
2.6.8.9.  Post marketing experience 
Risankizumab 150 mg (75 mg/0.83 mL × 2 SC injections) administered by SC injection at Week 0, 
Week 4, and every 12 weeks thereafter was first approved for the treatment of moderate to severe 
plaque psoriasis in adults on 26 March 2019 (international birth date) in Japan. Risankizumab is also 
approved in adult patients for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis in Japan, Russia and Europe 
(14/10/2021). Through 25 March 2021, risankizumab has been approved in 72 countries with 
estimated cumulative postmarketing patient exposure since first approval of 87,387 patient treatment 
years across 56 countries. Additionally, a 150 mg/mL formulation in PFS and autoinjector 
presentations has been approved by FDA and EMA. AbbVie has been continuing to monitor potential 
new safety signals through its ongoing routine pharmacovigilance that includes weekly review of all 
postmarketing reports, serious and non-serious, received from all sources (including literature) and 
SAEs from clinical trials; quarterly review of data mining scores generated from FDA's Adverse Event 
Reporting System database; periodic reports (Periodic Safety Update Report, development safety 
update reports, periodic adverse drug experience reports, etc.) with inclusion of sections outlining 
findings for AEs of interest, per mandated timelines, and postmarketing studies. 
The overall safety of risankizumab 150 mg was evaluated through review of postmarketing reports 
(spontaneous, solicited, literature) received from 26 March 2019 through 25 March 2021. Search of the 
AbbVie global safety database retrieved 29,696 cases with 58,850 events that were predominantly 
reported in the psoriasis patients. Overall, 91.6% (27,205/29,696) of the reports were considered non-
serious and 95.5% (28,358/29,696) were from a solicited source, which were predominantly collected 
through patient support programs. The most frequently reported MedDRA SOC (36% of all cases) was 
general disorders and administration site conditions, in which PTs of drug ineffective, fatigue, and 
therapeutic response shortened were most frequently reported. 
The most commonly reported AEs included psoriasis (8.5%), drug ineffective (3.8%), fatigue (3.6%), 
pruritus (3.3%), and headache (3%). These events are either labeled for risankizumab or commonly 
seen in the general population or patients with psoriasis. 
Although lack of efficacy (represented by PTs of psoriasis and drug ineffective) is listed as one of the 
most frequently reported events, it is not unexpected for a product indicated for a chronic condition. 
The most commonly reported SAE was death (0.2%). Of the 121 reports of death, 112 were from a 
solicited postmarketing source, which have known limitations in data quality that preclude a robust 
analysis. One hundred ten reports contained limited information to establish a causal association with 
risankizumab and 11 death reports were attributable to the patient's significant comorbidities and 
natural causes. In 71 of the reports where age was reported, the majority of the deaths occurred in 
the elderly population with a median age of 69 years. Psoriasis was the most common indication (79%) 
with the remaining largely unknown (17%). There was 1 death report that occurred in a patient with 
CD, however, it contained limited information for medical assessment. Psoriasis is associated with 
multiple comorbidities that could increase the risk of mortality in this population evidenced in a cohort 
study reporting an increased overall mortality risk (HR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.3 – 1.7) in patients with severe 
psoriasis (Gelfand 2007). 
CHMP assessment report on group of extensions of marketing authorisation  
EMA/887275/2022  
Page 230/258 
 
 
 
 
COVID-19 was the next most frequently reported SAE (0.17%), followed by hospitalization (0.15%), 
pneumonia (0.14%), and cerebrovascular accident (0.14%). COVID-19 continues to be monitored 
through standard surveillance activities and no new safety risks have been identified with COVID-19 
and risankizumab use. Considering the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and improved testing capabilities, 
the observed increase in the total number of reports received in patients receiving risankizumab is not 
unexpected. 
Though pneumonia and cerebrovascular accident were other most frequently reported SAEs, the 
events are uncommon. These events as part of serious infections and MACE, continue to be monitored 
as Important Potential Risks and no safety concerns have been identified. Studies have shown an 
increased prevalence of CV risk factors including diabetes, hypertension, and obesity in patients with 
psoriasis (Kimball 2010). 
Additionally, patients with moderate to severe psoriasis also have been shown to have an increased 
risk of MI (Gelfand 2006), stroke (Gelfand 2009), and CV mortality (Mehta 2010). 
Given these remaining SAEs were reported in less than 0.2% of the total events, and patients with 
psoriasis often have comorbidities that could increase the risk of mortality, these findings are not 
unexpected. Review of the postmarketing reports did not identify any new safety risks for the 
marketing of risankizumab. 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The MAH has focused the Summary of Clinical Safety on pooled data and data analysed separately for 
3 primary analysis sets; The Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction Period Safety Analysis Set, The 
Placebo-Controlled 52-Week Maintenance Period Safety Analysis Set, The All Treated Safety Analysis 
Set. The primary safety analysis sets are considered broadly reasonable. While the MAH outlines the 
Placebo-Controlled 52-Week Maintenance Period Safety Analysis Set as the most clinically relevant in 
terms of characterisation of safety results for maintenance treatment with risankizumab, noteworthy in 
terms of the proposed to-be-marketed dose and device is the absence of clinical safety data with the 
on-body delivery system. 
Patient exposure 
With respect to patient exposure, it is noted that Risankizumab is already authorised in the EU for 
treatment of moderate to severe plaque PsO (2019) as well as psoriatic arthritis in adults (2022) at a 
dose of 150 mg subcutaneous injection at week 0, week 4, and every 12 weeks thereafter. The MAH 
has outlined that post-marketing exposure to risankizumab is estimated to be 87,387 patient 
treatment years (PTY) cumulatively as of 25 March 2021.  
Exposure in the intended population to proposed marketed dosing is considered broadly acceptable in 
the context of ICH E1 and EMA Guideline on the development of new medicinal products for treatment 
of Crohn’s Disease. In the All Treated Safety Analysis Set n=688 subjects received the risankizumab 
600 mg IV induction dose and n=533 subjects received the risankizumab 360 mg SC maintenance 
dose, including 333 with at least 6 months of exposure and 233 with at least 12 months of exposure). 
However, a number of issues are raised in relation to exposure supporting the application.  
Firstly, there is no clinically relevant exposure to the proposed on-body delivery system (OBDS). Given 
bioequivalence has not been demonstrated for the to-be-marketed SC presentation of 360 mg OBDS 
compared to the Phase 3 90 mg/mL PFS, extrapolation of findings from the Safety Analysis Sets cannot 
be made.  
CHMP assessment report on group of extensions of marketing authorisation  
EMA/887275/2022  
Page 231/258 
 
 
 
 
Secondly, the MAH seeks an indication from 16 years of age. The number of adolescent patients 
included in the Crohn’s disease program is minimal. A total of n=12 received at least one dose of 
risankizumab and n=5 adolescent patients went past 52 weeks in maintenance. From data presented, 
there also appears to very minimal experience from outside of the Crohn’s disease program in patients 
less than 18 years. While the population pharmacokinetics analysis did not identify age as having an 
independent impact on risankizumab exposures, unexpected age-specific safety issues cannot be ruled 
out on the basis of data collected in adolescent patients. The MAH excluded adolescents who were not 
at Tanner stage 5 from the supporting clinical trials, though not all 16 year old adolescents will be 
Tanner stage 5. The MAH has outlined that all aspects of the Paediatric Investigational Plan are 
currently differed. As such, the MAH was requested to adjust the indication sought to ≥18 years. The 
MAH has agreed to restrict the indication to patients ≥ 18 years of age. 
Exposure in very elderly patients is (≥75 years) is also extremely limited with n=32 patients aged >65 
years in The Placebo-Controlled 52-Week Maintenance Period Safety Analysis Set and just n=5 aged 
>75 years. The MAH does not consider separate missing information for "use in patients > 65 years" is 
not warranted in the risankizumab RMP. Given the recommendations outlined in CPMP/EWP/2284/99 
Rev. 2 and the potential for safety to differ in these patients due to factors such as increased 
susceptibility to adverse events (including important potential risks of serious infection), polypharmacy 
and other physiological differences, the MAH was asked to discuss the need for a warning in section 
4.4 in light of the limited exposure in the elderly and the potential for safety to differ in these patients 
due to factors such as increased susceptibility to adverse events (including important potential risks of 
serious infection). The MAH discussed this and considered that ‘Based on the SmPC guidelines for 
considerations for Special warnings and precautions for use, since there is no risk identified leading to 
a precaution for use or which warrants a specific warning for the elderly population, addition of this 
information to section 4.4 is not warranted.’ This was accepted by the CHMP. 
Safety Summary 
Across the safety data sets, discontinuations for any reason were greatest in the placebo group. 
Reasons captured by “withdrawal by subject” do not appear to be otherwise described.  
In terms of analysis of AEs, in the 12 week induction safety set, there is little difference between the 
two treatment groups in terms of frequencies observed of all TEAES (54.7% in 600mg group v 54.1% 
in 1200 mg), severe TEAEs (5.2% in both 600mg IV and 1200 mg groups), serious TEAEs (6.6% in 
600mg group v 4% in 1200 mg) and TEAEs leading to discontinuation (2.1% in both 600mg IV and 
1200 mg groups). All categories of TEAEs (all TEAEs, related, severe, and serious and TEAES which led 
to discontinuation) occurred at greater frequency in the placebo group. TEAEs were driving the 
imbalance relate to indication (predominantly GI events) and are therefore not unexpected. 
In the 52 week Maintenance Safety Set TEAEs occurred at a similar overall frequency in both treatment 
groups when compared to the withdrawal (placebo SC) group with all TEAEs occurring in 71.5 % of the 
180 mg SC group, 72% of the 360 mg group and 73.4% of the withdrawal group. There was also little 
difference in terms of frequencies of TEAES assessed as related or serious TEAEs between treatment 
groups in the Maintenance Safety Set. Related TEAEs occurred in 27.4% of the 180 mg SC group, 
25.1% of the 360 mg group and 25% of the withdrawal group. Serious TEAEs occurring in 12.3% of 
the 180 mg SC group, 13.4% of the 360 mg group and 12.5% of the withdrawal group. 
It is agreed that the All Treated Safety Set the frequencies AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation of 
study drug, and deaths of the ANY RZB SC and the RZB 360 mg SC groups were similar to the 
corresponding rates observed in the Total RZB group of the Placebo-Controlled 52-Week Maintenance 
Period Safety Analysis Set. 
CHMP assessment report on group of extensions of marketing authorisation  
EMA/887275/2022  
Page 232/258 
 
 
 
 
The most common AEs include those associated with the underlying disease (Crohn’s, anaemia and 
other GI disorders) as well as those AEs already recognised in section 4.8 of the SmpC for Skyrizi 
including nasopharyngitis (as upper RTI) and headache. 
The frequency of TEAEs of Crohn's disease (worsening of CD) during the Placebo-Controlled 52-Week 
Maintenance Period Safety Analysis Set in the treatment groups, while less frequent, is not markedly 
different when compared to placebo, with 17% of withdrawal/placebo sc group experiencing a 
worsening of CD event, compared to 10.6% and 11.7% of the 180 mg and 360 mg SC treatment 
groups. While the difference in follow up time is acknowledged, the MAH was requested to discuss the 
apparent increase in worsening of CD events/waning of efficacy when compared to the frequencies 
observed in the Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction Period Safety Analysis Set (where a worsening 
of CD event was reported in 14.8% of placebo IV patients compared to 3.1% and 1.7% of the 
risankizumab 600 mg and 1200 mg IV groups respectively). 
The most frequent AEs considered by the investigators as related to study drug were generally 
comparable among the treatment and placebo patients across all 3 primary safety sets. 
Severe TEAEs were twice as frequent in the placebo group of the 12 week induction safety set, the 
imbalance driven by GI disorders associated with underlying disease.  
The Maintenance up to 52 Weeks analysis set and all Treated Safety Analysis Set demonstrated similar 
findings for 180mg SC treatment (6.7%) as compared to placebo/withdrawal group (12.5%), though 
the frequency of severe reactions in the 360mg SC patients (11.7%) was similar to that of the 
withdraw/placebo SC patients (with Severe AEs in GI and Infection/Infestation SOCs contributing to 
the majority of cases). 
In the 52 week Maintenance Safety Set, a difference in the exposure adjusted rate for injection site 
reactions (8/100 PYs for placebo SC group compared to 13.8/100 PYs for 360mg sc) is noted, though 
this is already a listed ADR in section 4.8 of the SmPC with a frequency of common. Also noteworthy is 
the difference in the exposure adjusted rate for hepatic events (4/100 PYs for placebo SC group 
compared to 9/100 PYs for 360mg sc).  
Deaths 
No deaths occurred in the Phase 2 CD studies. As of the data cutoff date for the submission, a total of 
6 deaths were reported in the Phase 3 CD studies, 4 in subjects treated with risankizumab and 2 in 
subjects treated with placebo. All deaths in subjects being treated with risankizumab were treatment-
emergent (i.e., occurred within 140 days after the last dose of risankizumab). 
Deaths in subjects being treated with risankizumab were due to acute respiratory failure (in a subject 
with squamous cell lung carcinoma), sepsis (in a subject with fistulizing CD exacerbation), sudden 
cardiac death (in a subject with a history of positive blood toxicology) and respiratory failure (in a 
subject with lung adenocarcinoma). None of the deaths were considered related to study drug. On the 
basis of the data presented the deaths which occurred do not raise particular concern because of 
known medical history of the subjects. 
COVID 19 
The MAH presented a summary of COVID-19 cases identified in the primary safety analysis sets. The 
low number of cases preclude a firm conclusion in terms of the potential for increased risk of infection 
or poor outcomes but there was no suggestion of same from the data presented. 
MACE 
The MAH presented a summary of MACE related events. There were 4 cases of relevance in patients 
exposed to 180mg risankizumab and 1 on the placebo group. It can be agreed that the events 
CHMP assessment report on group of extensions of marketing authorisation  
EMA/887275/2022  
Page 233/258 
 
 
 
 
occurred in patients with CV risk factors or a history of CV disease. When compared to the reported 
rate of MACE for the patient population (0.82/100 PY) (Kristensen 2013), the exposure-adjusted 
incidence rate observed was not immediately concerning (0.2/100 PY). MACE is listed as an important 
potential risk in the Summary of Safety Concerns which is agreed. The estimation of the rates of MACE 
is included as an objective of the cohort study for the Long-Term Prospective Cohort Study in Patients 
with Crohn's Disease in Real World Setting. 
Infections 
As outlined by the MAH, patients with CD have been shown to be at increased risk of common 
infections, viral infections, and GI infections in a population-based cohort study using the Royal College 
of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre primary care database from 2014 to 2019 
(Irving 2021). The most commonly reported infections in CD included upper respiratory tract infection 
(19.7%), skin infections (16.1%), and acute bronchitis (14.2%). In the Placebo-Controlled 12-Week 
Induction Period Safety Analysis Set a lower frequency of AEs in the infections and infestations SOC 
were reported in treatment arms compared to the placebo IV group (19.2% in 600mg IV and 18.3% in 
the 1200 mg group, compared to subjects in the placebo group 24.4%). Again, in the Placebo-
Controlled 52-Week Maintenance Period Safety Analysis Set the rate of infection-related AEs was lower 
in both risankizumab treatment arms (51.4 E/100 PY for 180 mg SC, 57.7 E/100 PY for 360 mg SC) 
compared to the rate in the withdrawal (placebo SC) arm (76.0 E/100 PY). It can be agreed from the 
data presented that no meaningful change in frequency or severity of the currently known ADR for 
upper respiratory tract infections was identified. Upper respiratory infections are currently listed in 
section 4.8 of the SmPC with a frequency of very common, a term that is denoted to include 
respiratory tract infection (viral, bacterial, or unspecified), sinusitis (including acute), rhinitis, 
nasopharyngitis, pharyngitis (including viral), tonsillitis, laryngitis, tracheitis. Updates to this footer 
propose a change to this footer with replacement of tracheitis by peritonsillar abscess. The MAH was 
requested to discuss and substantiate that update. The MAH considered that the PT of peritonsillar 
abscess is part of upper respiratory tract infection grouping and therefore it is appropriate to include 
this PT in the ADR table under upper respiratory tract infection grouped PTs. Nevertheless, information 
supporting the addition of peritonsillar abscess was considered limited by the CHMP. The MAH has 
removed the reference to peritonsillar abscess, and this was considered acceptable. 
Opportunistic Infections 
In the Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction Period Safety Analysis Set there were 3 opportunistic 
infections in the placebo group. There was a single (asymptomatic) CMV infection in the risankizumab 
1200 mg IV group, though this can be discounted as treatment emergent as confirmation of CMV was 
based on a biopsy obtained during Screening. There were no cases of relevance in the placebo group of 
the Placebo-Controlled 52-Week Maintenance Period Safety Analysis Set. There was a case of 
Aeromonas and a case of oral fungal infection in the 360mg sc and 180 sc groups respectively. There 
were 3 SAEs of opportunistic infection in the ANY RZB group (a clinically asymptomatic case of 
disseminated histoplasmosis, severe SAE of bronchopulmonary aspergillosis that resolved after 62 days 
and did not lead to study drug discontinuation and a case CMV which resolved after 8 days and did not 
lead to study drug discontinuation) and 1 SAE in the placebo IV/SC (RZB-naïve) group (neutropenic 
sepsis). Overall, it is agreed that the data did not demonstrate a greater frequency of opportunistic 
infection and the incidence rate observed in All Treated Safety Analysis Set (0.5/100 PY in 
risankizumab patients is consistent with the background rate for this patient population based on 
published estimates (0.80/100 PY) (Kirchgesner 2018).  
Tuberculosis and herpes zoster 
The frequencies of active TB were similar in Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction Period Safety 
Analysis Set with a case of active TB in placebo group and a second case in the risankizumab 600 mg 
CHMP assessment report on group of extensions of marketing authorisation  
EMA/887275/2022  
Page 234/258 
 
 
 
 
IV group (40-50 year-old subject who had been treated for TB 7 years prior to study entry. There was 
an additional case of active TB in the All Treated Safety Analysis Set which occurred in a 30-40 year 
old patient on day 118 following treatment with 600mg IV induction followed by maintenance 
treatment with 600 mg sc. The patient was reported to have been in contact with a TB positive person. 
The MAH did not comment on the overall incidence rate of active TB in the All Treated Safety Analysis 
Set (0.097/100 PY) in terms of the expected rates for the population/ trial site locations. However, in 
terms of subjects with latent TB, the data was reassuring. Patients with latent TB were enrolled and 
treated TB prophylaxis (according to local country guidelines). A total of 72 subjects with latent TB 
were treated with risankizumab and TB prophylaxis during the study and did not develop active TB 
during the mean treatment follow-up of 1.4 years; 55 subjects with latent TB who did not receive 
prophylaxis during the study did not develop active TB during the mean treatment follow-up of 2.0 
years. 
The rates of herpes zoster infection was similar across the safety analysis sets. In the Placebo-
Controlled 12-Week Induction Period Safety Analysis Set the was 1 event (0.3%, 1.2 E/100 PY) in the 
600 mg IV group, 2 events (0.2%, 0.6 E/100 PY) in the 1200 mg IV group and 1 event in the placebo 
group (0.2%, 0.7 E/100 PY). In the Placebo-Controlled 52-Week Maintenance Period Safety Analysis 
Set the rates were again similar and the rate of herpes zoster in the ANY RZB SC group was 0.8 E/100 
PY (12 events, All Treated Safety Analysis Set). None of the events were serious or led to study drug 
discontinuation and all events were mild to moderate in severity. 
Malignancies, NMSC, and Malignant Tumours Excluding NMSC 
In terms of malignancies, NMSC, and malignant tumours excluding NMSC the incidence rates of 
malignancies were low in Placebo controlled safety analysis sets. In Placebo-Controlled 12-Week 
Induction Period Safety Analysis Set there was a case of SCC reported on treatment day 8 in 1200mg 
IV arm which was considered unrelated. In the Placebo-Controlled 52-Week Maintenance Period Safety 
Analysis Set the rates were similar across treatment arms with no events in the risankizumab 180 mg 
arm, 0.6/100 PY [1 subject] in the 360 mg arm, and 0.6/100 PY [1 subject] in the withdrawal (placebo 
SC) arm. The subject in the risankizumab 360 mg arm had HER2-positive breast cancer, and the 
subject in the withdrawal (placebo SC) arm had basal cell carcinoma; both subjects had risk factors 
and the events were considered to have no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug by the 
investigator.  
Most relevant in terms of malignancies and lag time for occurrence is the All Treated Safety Analysis 
Set. The MAH presents a cumulative incidence plots for treatment-emergent malignancies excluding 
NMSC which shows a cumulative incidence that is apparently stable to 252 and then approximately 4.8 
years. The MAH outlines that the apparent increase thereafter is due to a single report of melanoma 
out of 30 subjects leading to an approximate 3.4% increase from the 1.8% rate preceding that event. 
It can be agreed that the low numbers left in follow up prevents conclusions about the cumulative 
frequency past 252 weeks. In general though the incidence rate of malignancy was 0.5/100 PY for the 
ANY RZB group, which is not concerning in terms of the background rate reported for this patient 
population based on published estimates (1.33/100 PY) (Taborelli 2020). 
Hepatic disorder 
The MAH has conducted a comprehensive analysis of reported Hepatic Events as well as hepatic 
laboratory data. The MAH’s approach in terms of the assessment of comprehensive laboratory data in 
addition to PTs of relevance for assessment of this ASI is endorsed. The frequencies of AST and ALT 
elevation are presented as well as the frequencies of combined elevations of aminotransferases and 
bilirubin. It is noteworthy that during the Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction Period Safety Analysis 
Set there were no patients in the placebo group who experienced ALT and/or ALT elevations ≥ 3ULN 
accompanied by elevations in total bilirubin where as in the risankizumab treatment groups there were 
CHMP assessment report on group of extensions of marketing authorisation  
EMA/887275/2022  
Page 235/258 
 
 
 
 
5 patients who experienced AST and or ALT elevations ≥ 3 ULN with TBL ≥1.5 ULN, 4 of which were in 
600mg IV group (0.6%) and 1 in 1200mg group (0.2%). The MAH was requested to provide a brief 
summary of these cases to give an understanding of the likely causality in the context of possibly early 
readings of TBL which may have risen further and in light of the number of cases falling within the 
Temple's Corollary quadrant of the edish plots provided.  While there was an imbalance in cases falling 
into “Temple's Corollary” for risankizumab patients compared to placebo, The MAH assessment of 
these 5 cases of AST and or ALT elevations ≥ 3 ULN with TBL ≥1.5 ULN following exposure to 
risankizumab is accepted. The cases included confounding factors had resolution of the liver test 
abnormalities or hepatic events with continued risankizumab therapy. 
There were also 3 additional patients who experienced AST and or ALT elevations ≥ 3 ULN with TBL ≥2 
ULN (criteria for meeting Hys Law if no evidence of biliary obstruction or some other explanation of the 
injury), 2 of which were in 600mg IV group (0.3%) and 1 in 1200mg group (0.2%). The MAH 
presented a summary of these 3 cases and outlined that all 3 can be out ruled as Hy’s Law cases on 
the basis of more likely explications. The first case is in a 60-70 year-old subject in the risankizumab 
600 mg IV treatment group who experienced ALT 159 U/L (> 3 × ULN), AST 136 U/L (> 3 × ULN), 
Grade 3 total bilirubin 91 μmol/L (≥ 3 × ULN), Grade 3 ALP (923 U/L, > 5 × ULN) and Grade 4 gamma 
glutamyl transferase (GGT) (1092 U/L, > 20 × ULN) on treatment day 28 following initiation for 
amoxicillin-clavulanate (Days 23 through 27). The patient was noted to be on concomitant 
methotrexate and isoniazid (for TB prophylaxis; Days 1 through 36). It would appear this case fits with 
hepatocellular-cholestatic injury associated with treatment of older men with amoxicillin-clavulanate 
and the companies assessment that this case was unlikely related to risankizumab is fully agreed.  
Similarly, the case of AST: 156 U/L and total bilirubin 82 μmol/L in a 40-50 year-old subject in the 
risankizumab 1200 mg IV treatment group on study day 4 following treatment with paracetamol, 
hydrocodone/acetaminophen, ondansetron, piperacillin/tazobactam, morphine, and prochlorperazine 
for gastroenteritis is considered likely related to paracetamol toxicity especially in the context of a 
positive dechallenge when paracetamol was discontinued and maintained treatment with risankizumab.  
The case presented in the 30-40 year-old subject in the risankizumab 600 mg IV group with a history 
of hepatic steatosis and concomitant azathioprine (100 mg beginning on Day –567, with dose change 
to 125 mg on Day –202 and continuing to Day 80) is considered less clear cut in terms of causality. 
The patient had their last dose of rizankizumab on day 29 and experienced Grade 4 ALT (49.15 – 61.6 
× ULN), AST (22.5 – 30 × ULN), and bilirubin (2.13 – 2.2 × ULN) elevations (ALP was normal at 
114.67 U/L) on day 82 in the context of being hospitalised for a rash on day 80. The causality 
assessment of the investigator was that the hepatic injury had a reasonable possibility of being related 
to study drug yet the MAH point to the delayed time to onset of liver enzyme elevation (7 weeks after 
last study drug dose) and the pattern of rapid resolution of liver enzymes in the setting of long half-life 
of study drug (28 to 29 days). The MAH clarified the duration of liver enzyme derangement for this 
patient and the issue was considered resolved. 
The lack of meaningful difference between risankizumab arms and the withdrawal (placebo SC) arm in 
Placebo-Controlled 52-Week Maintenance Period Safety Analysis Set in terms of the percentage of 
subjects with an ALT or AST ≥ 3 × ULN or ALT or AST ≥ 5 × ULN is noted, as is the fact that there 
were no possible Hy’s law cases during this time. During the induction period there were no patients in 
the placebo group who experienced ALT and/or ALT elevations ≥ 3ULN accompanied by elevations in 
total bilirubin whereas in the risankizumab treatment groups there were 5 patients who experienced 
AST and or ALT elevations ≥ 3 ULN with TBL ≥1.5 ULN, 4 of which were in 600mg IV group (0.6%) 
and 1 in 1200mg group (0.2%). The MAH provided a summary of the 5 cases of AST and or ALT 
elevations ≥ 3 ULN with TBL ≥1.5 ULN which occurred during the Placebo-Controlled 52-Week 
Maintenance Period Safety Analysis Set on request. While there is an imbalance in cases falling into 
“Temple's Corollary” for risankizumab patients compared to placebo, the MAH’s assessment of these 5 
CHMP assessment report on group of extensions of marketing authorisation

Page 236/258 
 
 
 
 
cases of AST and or ALT elevations ≥ 3 ULN with TBL ≥1.5 ULN following exposure to risankizumab is 
accepted. The cases included confounding factors had resolution of the liver test abnormalities or 
hepatic events with continued risankizumab therapy. There is insufficient data to conclude a causal 
relationship between risankizumab treatment and hepatotoxicity. 
Hypersensitivity and infusion related reactions 
No cases across the risankizumab Phase 3 CD development program were adjudicated as anaphylactic 
reaction in risankizumab-treated subjects.  
While the rates of hypersensitivity reactions were similar between the risankizumab and placebo 
groups in the Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction Period Safety Analysis Set, it is noted that 3 
patients discontinued due to hypersensitivity infusion-related reactions. One subject in the 
risankizumab 1200 mg IV group had an infusion-related reaction of moderate severity on Day 6 and 
discontinued study drug. Another Subject, also in the risankizumab 1200 mg IV group, had an 
infusion-related reaction of moderate severity on Day 1 and discontinued study drug. Both events were 
considered by the investigator to have a reasonable possibility of being related to study drug. One 
subject in the risankizumab 600 mg IV group had an infusion-related reaction of mild severity on Day 
36 and discontinued study drug.  
During the induction period, the rates of ISRs (including infusion related reactions) were similar 
between the risankizumab 600 mg IV, risankizumab 1200 mg IV, and placebo IV groups.  
During the 52-week maintenance period, the rate of ISRs were 9.5 E/100 PY, 13.8 E/100 PY, and 8.1 
E/100 PY in the risankizumab 180 mg SC, risankizumab 360 mg SC, and withdrawal (placebo SC) 
arms, respectively. The rate in the any risankizumab treatment SC group of the All Treated Safety 
Analysis Set was 9.5 E/100 PY. 
Serious hypersensitivity reactions are listed as an Important potential risk with and evaluation of the 
rates of serious hypersensitivity reactions is an objective of the proposed long term cohort study listed 
as additional pharmacovigilance activities. 
In the Placebo-Controlled 52-Week Maintenance Period Safety Analysis Set the event rates of 
hypersensitivity reactions were similar across the treatment arms with 12.4 E/100 PY, 12.6 E/100 PY, 
and 11.8 E/100 PY reported for the risankizumab180 mg SC, risankizumab 360 mg SC, and withdrawal 
(placebo SC) arms, respectively. No serious hypersensitivity reactions were reported.  
The rate of serious hypersensitivity reactions across any risankizumab exposure (<0.1 E/100 PY) was 
low. 
Immunogenicity to risankizumab did not appear to have any clinically relevant impacts on 
hypersensitivity reactions, though the low number of patient’s experiencing ADA precludes any 
conclusions in this regard.  
Laboratory values and vital signs 
Overall, it is agreed that the evaluation of mean changes over time and individual subject changes in 
haematology and clinical chemistry values, as well as potentially clinically significant abnormalities in 
hematology and clinical chemistry, does not reveal any dose-dependent patterns or any significant 
safety concerns with risankizumab treatment. The MAH outlines decreases in mean platelet counts 
were observed in the 12-Week Induction Safety Analysis Set and Placebo-Controlled 52-Week 
Maintenance Period Safety Analysis Set). The plotted mean change in platelet values provided by the 
MAH demonstrates an effect on platelet levels (mean decrease of >40 10^9/L, which the MAH outlines, 
reflects the decreased systemic inflammation observed). In the excerpt from the analysis of 
Haematology in the SA1A population there are some very low minimum levels of platelets (highlighted 
CHMP assessment report on group of extensions of marketing authorisation  
EMA/887275/2022  
Page 237/258 
 
 
 
 
above). The MAH has confirmed that the findings of very low minimum levels of platelets from the 
SA1A population identified in the two induction studies were due to data entry errors and that no 
subjects reported clinically significant low platelet counts during the induction and maintenance 
studies. 
In response to day 120 LOQ the MAH presented a comprehensive summary of the mean change from 
baseline of lipid following treatment with risankizumab. It is agreed that numerical increases in TC 
cholesterol and LDL-C in subjects with CD treated with risankizumab were unlikely to be clinically 
meaningful for the patients included in these trials (the mean values following risankizumab treatment 
for both total cholesterol (maximum 4.61 mmol/L) and LDL-C (maximum 2.47 mmol/L) at any 
evaluated time point were below the values of the 50th percentile in the general population) though 
there is perhaps some uncertainty with respect to use in patients with more borderline or elevated 
baselines levels.  
It can be agreed that mean changes in vital sign parameters during risankizumab administration were 
not considered clinically meaningful. 
Data pertaining to To-Be-Marketed Presentation On Body Delivery System 
Clinical data for the proposed to-Be-Marketed Presentation On Body Delivery System comes from study 
M19-128. The primary objective of substudy 1 of this trial was to assess the relative bioavailability of 
risankizumab in the to-be-marketed 360 mg OBDS versus the 90 mg PFS used in the Phase 3 studies 
following a single SC administration at the dose of 360. As this was a single dose study, there is limited 
value in terms of characterising the safety of the drug device system. Of note, this study failed to 
demonstrate bioequivalence for Cmax. 
It is noted that there were markedly different safety findings observed for the OBDS treatment groups 
compared to PFS groups in Study M19-128 (related ADRs reported in 0.8% of PFS treated patients 
compared to 27% of 360 mg OBDS and 23% of subjects reported TEAEs that were related to the OBDS 
for the 360 mg -Group 2). A fourfold increased frequency of injection site reactions was observed in 
OBDS treated patients (which occurred in 34.9% of the 360mg treated OBDS patients and 26.7% of 
the 180mg OBDS treated patients compared to 8.7% of the 360 mg PFS treated patients) when 
compared to PFS treated patients treated in M19-128 and when compared to patients treated with 
either 180mg or 360mg SC as part of 52-Week Maintenance in M16-000 Sub-Study 1. The nature of 
device related ADRS suggests local inflammatory reactions. However, the single dose design of M19-
128 limits the interpretation in terms of clinical relevance of this apparent imbalance.  
The MAH has demonstrated that there was no trend of increased adverse events with increasing 
exposure for both Cmax and Cavg metrics and bioequivalence was demonstrated between the OBDS 
and PFS for AUC. Therefore, the matter is no longer pursued in terms of extrapolation of safety from 
the findings from the Safety Analysis Sets.  
The MAH presents a comparison of hypersensitivity reactions and injection site reactions by ADA 
status, though the very low number of patients who experienced ADAs or reactions covered by the 
Hypersensitivity SMQ and CMQ employed preclude any useful analysis. It is nonetheless noted that 
ADAs are twice as common in the OBDS 360mg group when compared to the PFS 360 mg group. In 
response to request from the CHMP the MAH showed that, while a higher anti-drug antibody (ADA) 
incidence was observed in the 360 mg OBDS group (13%) compared to the 90 mg/mL PFS group 
(6%), the treatment-emergent ADA incidences across all groups were within the range observed in 
previous Phase 1 single dose studies. There were minimal differences in risankizumab exposure 
between ADA-positive and ADA-negative groups and comparison of events between 360 OBDS and PFS 
treatment groups suggest the higher ADA incidence did not drive the difference in immune-related 
safety events (hypersensitivity reactions and injection-site reactions [ISRs]).

Non-drug study 
F20-282 was a non-drug study which enrolled 36 subjects. The primary objective of this study was to 
gather data on the effectiveness of the OBDS adhesive using qualitative and quantitative measures. 
One subject out of 36 experiences and AE with reasonable possibility of being related (paresthesia and 
warmth resolved within 14 minutes and there was no finding or irritation on the adhesive skin 
assessment at 15- and 30- minutes post-removal). No safety issues are identified from this study. 
Elderly 
The MAH outlines that there was no clear pattern with respect to age for any category of AEs or ASIs in 
the Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction Period Safety Analysis Set and that overall no new safety 
findings were identified with regard to risankizumab use and age. For the patients <18 years and those 
>18 to <65 years, in terms of frequency of TEAEs, the treatment arms are more favourable than the 
placebo IV group. It is noted though that for patients over 65 years, the number of all TEAEs, severe 
TEAEs and SAEs are greater for treatment arms than for the placebo IV. The low number of elderly 
patients exposed (n=32 patients for 600 mg IV and n=24 exposed to 1200 mg IV) add uncertainty to 
this finding. On request from the CHMP the MAH updated Section 5.2 of the SmPC to note that a total 
of 5 subjects with CD exposed to risankizumab were 75 years or older. The MAH outlines that greater 
portion of elderly patients experiencing an SAE (40% of patients ≥75 and 23.9% of patients aged 65-
74 years versus 17% of patients <65 years) was largely driven by the imbalance of cardiac disorders 
and vascular disorders, which the MAH states are expected given the higher prevalence of 
cardiovascular diseases in the elderly population. The MAH has not explicitly confirmed if the 
frequencies of events observed are in line with the frequencies expected in the population. The MAH 
was invited to comment. The MAH was requested to discuss the need for a warning in section 4.4 in 
light of the limited exposure in the elderly and the potential for safety to differ in these patients due to 
factors such as increased susceptibility to adverse events (including important potential risks of serious 
infection). The MAH has discussed this and considers that ‘Based on the SmPC guidelines for 
considerations for Special warnings and precautions for use, since there is no risk identified leading to 
a precaution for use or which warrants a specific warning for the elderly population, addition of this 
information to section 4.4 is not warranted.’ This was considered acceptable. 
Adolescents 
The MAH outlines that in the ANY RZB group of the All Treated Safety Analysis Set, subjects under 18 
years of age had a numerically higher AE rate overall than subjects above 18 years of age though they 
outline that these differences should be interpreted with caution give the very low numbers exposed. 
While the higher overall rates in TEAES are noted in this group, it is agreed that there is no specific 
pattern in terms of the nature of ARs. Nonetheless, the number of patients aged 16 years to 18 years 
(n=12 exposed to at least one dose, n=5 exposed to 52 weeks) are considered to be insufficient to 
have characterised age specific safety effects, if they did exit.  
Race wright, geographic region 
The MAH has presented safety data to assess differences in frequency and nature of AEs and ASE 
depending on intrinsic factors of weight, race and geographic region. Based on the totality of data 
presented it can be agreed that no new safety findings were identified with regard to risankizumab use 
and weight and race and that while there were differences observed in terms of frequency of some 
ASIs depending on geographic region, there was no definite trend in terms of the types of AEs, SAEs, 
AEs leading to discontinuation, or AEs in ASI categories by geographic region. 
It is noted that race and body weight did not show a clinically relevant effect on risankizumab PK 
though Black or African American patients are underrepresented in the safety data set (n=39 in 
induction period, n=51 in all treated) which adds uncertainty in terms of the characterisation of safety 
CHMP assessment report on group of extensions of marketing authorisation  
EMA/887275/2022  
Page 239/258 
 
 
 
 
for these patient. The MAH argued the safety profile in Black or African American subjects was 
consistent with that observed in the overall population. This issue was not further pursued. 
Inconsistent trend in the serious infection rates between Bio-IR and Non-Bio-IR subjects among the 
treatment groups were observed in the Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction Period Safety Analysis 
Set and All Treated Safety Analysis Set. It is agreed that the low number of events in general result in 
some uncertainty with respect to effects of Bio-IR status on safety but that the comparable rate of 
serious infections in the ANY risankizumab group in Bio-IR patients (3.7 E/100 PY) and Non-Bio-IR 
patients (3.1 E/100 PY) suggests there is no meaningful difference in the risk of experiencing serious 
infection between Bio-IR and Non-Bio-IR populations. 
Pregnancy and lactation 
Exposure of pregnant women during the CD development program is limited to 16 patients. At the time 
of reporting there were 6 ongoing pregnancies and the MAH was invited to provide outcome data if 
available for these births. The outcomes were reported as 3 live births, 2 spontaneous abortions, 1 
elective termination due to foetal defect (foetal cystic hygroma and hydrops at 12 + weeks gestation 
where the investigator reported there were no obvious risk factors or family history relevant to this 
event, 3 elective terminations (no foetal defects) and 1 loss to follow up. 
Use in pregnancy and lactation is listed as missing information and the MAH proposed a non-
interventional cohort study in pregnant patients with Crohn's disease, and compare pregnancy and 
infant outcomes to pregnant patients with Crohn's disease who were treated with alternative therapies. 
Post authorisation evaluation of safety in pregnancy is endorsed. 
The MAH did not propose a change to the current SmPC wording relating to Pregnancy and lactation. 
This is considered acceptable. 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Risankizumab selectively binds with high affinity (< 29 pM) to the p19 subunit of human interleukin 23 
(IL-23) cytokine and inhibits its interaction with the IL-23 receptor. Risankizumab is authorised for 
treatment of plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Post-marketing exposure to risankizumab is 
estimated to be 87,387 patient treatment years (PTY) cumulatively as of 25 March 2021. 
Data presented for the Crohn’s Disease development program did not demonstrate dose-dependent 
safety findings between the risankizumab IV induction doses studied (600 mg and 1200 mg) or the 
risankizumab SC maintenance doses studied (180 mg or 360 mg). Overall, no new safety concerns 
arise from the CD and the frequency and nature of ARs appear to be in line with the established safety 
profile. In particular, there is insufficient exposure in adolescents to support the indication initially 
sought (from 16 years of age) therefore the MAH was requested to amend the indication from 16 years 
of age to ≥18 years of age. This has been amended. 
Uncertainties remain, relating to use in elderly patients and due to limited clinical experience with the 
OBDS which appears to have a greater potential for injection site reactions.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety: two 
category 3 PASS studies are agreed for the CD indication on the long-term and pregnancy use.

Summary of Objectives 
The specific objectives of this study 
are to: 
- Evaluate the rate of major 
congenital malformations in infants 
born to women exposed to 
risankizumab during pregnancy 
compared to those exposed to other 
systemic treatments (primary 
outcome for sample size 
estimation). 
- Evaluate and compare pregnancy 
outcomes (i.e., live birth, 
spontaneous abortion, elective 
abortion, stillbirth) among women 
exposed to risankizumab versus 
comparators during pregnancy 
- Assess and compare infant 
outcomes (neonatal deaths, serious 
infections up to 1 year of age) 
among infants born to women 
exposed to risankizumab during 
pregnancy compared to those 
exposed to other biologic 
treatments. 
The clinical trial programs did 
not assess the safety of 
risankizumab use during 
pregnancy.  In addition to the 
study of risankizumab exposure 
in psoriasis patients, a study of 
pregnancy outcomes in patients 
with Crohn's disease who are 
exposed to risankizumab, 
compared to alternative biologic 
treatments, will be conducted. 
A comparative cohort study will 
be conducted to describe 
risankizumab exposure in 
pregnant patients with Crohn's 
disease, and compare pregnancy 
and infant outcomes to pregnant 
patients with Crohn's disease who 
were treated with alternative 
therapies (e.g., biologics).  In 
addition, descriptive analyses of 
pregnancy outcomes in patients 
with Crohn's disease without 
exposure to any treatments under 
investigation will also be 
conducted.

Summary of Objectives 
The primary objective of Study 
M15-997 is to investigate long-term 
safety and tolerability of 
risankizumab in subjects with 
psoriasis who have completed one 
of the preceding Phase 2/3 studies. 
The clinical trial program was 
not able to fully characterize the 
safety profile of risankizumab in 
the Crohn's disease population.  
Additional long-term data are 
needed from the real-world 
experience of patients with 
Crohn's disease treated with 
risankizumab to assess product 
potential risks.  A comparative 
cohort study will be conducted to 
estimate rates of malignancy 
(malignancy excluding NMSC, 
NMSC), serious infections, 
serious hypersensitivity reactions, 
and MACE in risankizumab 
treated patients with Crohn's 
disease, relative to alternative 
systemic therapies (e.g., 
biologics). 
The primary objective of the open-
label period 2 of Study M16-011 is 
to evaluate the long-term safety,

2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The user testing of the PL for risankizumab 360 mg solution for injection in a cartridge (SC) has been 
presented in a full report. A bridging report for the risankizumab 600 mg solution for injection (IV) as 
daughter PL to the 360 mg (SC) PL as parent PL has been provided. 
The overall quality of the user tested PL is regarded as acceptable. The user testing of the PL is 
accepted as providing results that indicate it will meet patients’ needs such that they will be able to 
locate important information within the PL, understand it and act upon it safely and correctly. 
Bridging the risankizumab 600 mg solution for injection (IV) PL to the 360 mg (SC) PL is acceptable.   
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Crohn's disease (CD) encompasses a spectrum of clinical and pathological processes manifested by 
focal asymmetric, transmural, and occasionally granulomatous inflammation that can affect any 
segment of the gastrointestinal tract and presents with symptoms of fatigue, prolonged diarrhoea with 
or without gross bleeding, abdominal pain, weight loss, and fever. The disease can affect persons of 
any age, and its onset is most common in the second and third decades. Females are affected slightly 
more than males, and the risk for disease is higher in some ethnic groups. The incidence of CD 
worldwide has increased over the last three decades, particularly in newly industrialized countries. CD 
incidence is highest in North America and Europe, with estimates of 23.8 and 15 per 100,000 person-
years in North America and Europe, respectively. The burden of CD also remains substantial, with the 
highest prevalence estimates in Europe (322 per 100,000 persons) and North America (319 per 
100,000 persons). 
The exact cause of CD is still unknown but is hypothesized to be the result of a dysregulated immune 
system in the context of a genetically susceptible individual. It is thought that a combination of a 
CHMP assessment report on group of extensions of marketing authorisation  
EMA/887275/2022  
Page 247/258 
 
 
 
 
patient's genetics, microbiome, immune response, and the environment result in an excessive and 
abnormal immune response in the gut that results in pathology seen in CD. 
The aim of medical treatment in CD has been focused on controlling inflammation and reducing 
symptoms. In addition to improving symptoms, an emerging goal of therapy is to heal the gut mucosa. 
Resolution of intestinal ulcers and endoscopic remission have been associated with positive clinical 
benefits, including higher rates of clinical remission, fewer hospitalizations, and fewer abdominal 
surgeries. However, improvement of the appearance of the intestinal mucosa may be more difficult to 
achieve than symptomatic improvement alone.  
With this line extension, the new presentations and strengths are indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease who have had an inadequate response to, 
lost response to, or were intolerant to conventional therapy or a biologic therapy. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The current standard of medical care for Crohn’s disease involves anti-inflammatory therapeutic 
approaches, which include 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) compounds, corticosteroids, immune-
modulators including azathioprine (AZA) or its active metabolite 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and 
methotrexate (MTX), and biologic agents including tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist therapies, 
anti-IL and anti-integrin therapies. Even with combinations of the available therapeutic options, many 
patients do not attain clinical benefit, cannot tolerate the therapy, or lose response over time. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
M15-991 and M16-006 (induction studies) 
The 2 induction studies were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluations of risankizumab 
(risankizumab 600 mg IV or 1200 mg IV at Weeks 0, 4, and 8) in subjects 16 years and older with 
moderately to severely active CD.  Study M15-991 was designed to enrol subjects who had a 
documented inadequate response or intolerance to use of an approved biologic agent (Bio-IR). Study 
M16-006 was designed to enroll subjects who were Bio-IR or subjects who were Non-Bio-IR. 
M16-000 Sub-Study 1 (maintenance) 
This was a randomized, double blind, 52-Week placebo-controlled study to assess the safety and 
efficacy of RZB for maintenance in moderately to severely active CD. The trial population, emanating 
from the induction studies M15-991 and M16-001, included a mixed population of approximately 75% 
Bio-IR and 25% non-BIO IR subjects.  
The co-primary endpoints for the 3 studies were discussed under scientific advice; they were accepted 
as reflecting clinically important targets for symptomatic, clinical and endoscopic response to long term 
treatment. Achieving endoscopic endpoints has been associated with improved long-term outcomes. 
The baseline demographic and disease characteristics were similar to those reported in other studies 
for the condition under study. The population is accepted as representative of patients with moderate 
to severe CD requiring induction followed by maintenance systemic therapy based on CD status, in the 
context of the proposed indication. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The results of the Phase 2 dose-finding Study M15-993 (1311.6) indicated a dose dependent response, 
supporting the higher RZB dose (600 mg) for induction and at least a dose of RZB 180 mg SC for 
CHMP assessment report on group of extensions of marketing authorisation  
EMA/887275/2022  
Page 248/258 
 
 
 
 
maintenance of effect but an upper dose-response limit, for induction or maintenance, was not 
deduced. 
Induction Study M15-991 
The proportion of subjects in clinical remission at Week 12 as per SF/APS criteria (co-primary 
endpoint) was greater in both the 600 mg IV (34.6) and 1200 mg IV (39.8%) RZB groups than in the 
placebo group (19.3%; p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). 
The proportion of subjects in endoscopic response at Week 12 (co-primary endpoint US and OUS 
protocols) was greater in both the 600 mg IV (28.8%) and 1200 mg IV (34.2%) RZB groups than in 
the placebo group (11.2%; p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). 
The proportion of subjects in clinical remission at Week 12 as per CDAI criteria (co-primary endpoint 
US) was greater in both the 600 mg IV (42.0%) and 1200 mg IV (40.3%) RZB groups than in the 
placebo group (19.8; p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). 
Induction Study M16-006 
The proportion of subjects in clinical remission at Week 12 as per SF/APS criteria (co-primary 
endpoint) was greater in both the 600 mg IV (43.5%) and 1200 mg IV (41.0%) RZB groups than in 
the placebo group (21.7%; p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). 
The proportion of subjects in endoscopic response at Week 12 (co-primary endpoint US and OUS 
protocols) was greater in both the 600 mg IV (40.3%8%) and 1200 mg IV (32.1%) RZB groups than 
in the placebo group (12.0%; p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). 
The proportion of subjects in clinical remission at Week 12 as per CDAI criteria (co-primary endpoint 
US) was greater in both the 600 mg IV (44.2%) and 1200 mg IV (41.6%) RZB groups than in the 
placebo group (24.6; p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). 
Both induction studies met their co-primary endpoints. 
Enhanced SF/APS clinical response and clinical remission were demonstrated to be significant as early 
as Week 4 in subjects treated with RZB and continued to improve through Week 12. 
Additional secondary endpoints measured at Week 12 included the proportion of subjects with 
enhanced SF/APS clinical response (with ≥60% decrease in average daily SF and/or ≥35% decrease in 
average daily AP score and both not worse than Baseline, and/or clinical remission), endoscopic 
remission (SES-CD ≤4 and at least a 2 point reduction versus Baseline and no subscore greater than 1 
in any individual variable), mucosal healing (SES-CD ulcerated surface subscore of 0 in subjects with a 
subscore of >1 at Baseline), a decrease of least 100 points in baseline CDAI, and a CDAI <150 at 
Week 12. In addition, rates of CD-related hospitalisations through Week 12 were lower in subjects 
treated with RZB compared to placebo in both induction studies. 
In M16-006, a higher proportion of subjects treated with RZB achieved clinical remission per SF/SP 
score and endoscopic response compared to PBO in groups with and without prior biologic failure.   
In addition, a higher portion of subjects also achieved clinical response measured by CDAI<150 
compared to placebo  
For M16-000, Sub-Study 1 (maintenance), overall, superiority of RZB 360mg compared to PBO for 
maintenance treatment was seen for the co-primary endpoints at week 52. 
Patients in the RZB 360 mg arm demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OUS (and US) 
co-primary data sets. However, the 180mg regimen failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo. 
CHMP assessment report on group of extensions of marketing authorisation  
EMA/887275/2022  
Page 249/258 
 
 
 
 
While not statistically significant, secondary endpoints on endoscopic results are supportive of the 
efficacy of RZB versus placebo.  Evaluation of endoscopic endpoints (e.g., endoscopic remission, ulcer-
free endoscopy, sustained endoscopic remission, deep remission) demonstrated a dose response, with 
the RZB 360 mg SC arm having higher efficacy than observed for the RZB 180 mg SC arm versus 
placebo.    
Subgroup analysis 
Results reported for subgroup analysis indicated higher efficacy in BIO-IR subjects compared to non-
BIO-IR subjects, with somewhat mixed results for RZB 1200mg IV induction followed by RZB 180 mg 
SC maintenance versus RZB 600 mg IV induction versus RZB 360 mg SC maintenance regimens. 
As supportive data, exposure-response analyses, conducted using Phase 3 maintenance data, show 
trends of higher response with the higher range exposures associated with RZB 360 mg SC q8w for 
most of the evaluated efficacy endpoints, particularly for the endoscopic endpoints. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The key uncertainty regarding the favourable effects observed in RZB treatment for CD concerns the 
fact that, important clinical secondary endpoints were of nominal significance only therefore no 
confirmatory conclusion on the statistical significance of the reported results can be made. However, it 
is accepted that the co primary endpoints for maintenance of effect was demonstrated for the higher 
dose, despite the fact that all thirteen secondary endpoints offer no confirmatory statistical evidence. 
Although this is consistent with the CHMP guideline on multiplicity adjustments, the guidelines do point 
out that even though type I error adjustment may not be required for secondary endpoints, it would 
not automatically mean the evidence may be totally reliable. However, it was felt, on balance, 
maintenance of clinical efficacy can be concluded for the 360mg dose. 
While the drug substance and drug product used in the pivotal trials are the to-be-marketed forms of 
RZB, the to-be-marketed SC presentation is an on-person device has not been studied at Phase 3.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
No new safety signals arise from the data presented for this extension of indication for Crohn’s Disease 
and the frequency and nature of ARs appear to be in line with the established safety profile. No dose-
dependent safety findings between the risankizumab IV induction doses studied (600 mg and 1200 
mg) or the risankizumab SC maintenance doses studied (180 mg or 360 mg) were identified.  
The most common AEs in the All Treated Safety Analysis include those associated with the underlying 
disease (Crohn’s, anaemia and other GI disorders) as well as those AEs already recognised in section 
4.8 of Skyrizi including nasopharyngitis (as upper RTI) and headache. The most frequent AEs 
considered by the investigators as related to study drug were generally comparable among the 
treatment and placebo patients across all 3 primary safety sets. 
In the 52 week Maintenance Safety Set, a difference in the exposure adjusted rate for injection site 
reactions (8/100 PYs for placebo SC group compared to 13.8/100 PYs for 360mg sc) is noted, though 
this is already a listed ADR in section 4.8 of the SmPC with a frequency of common. A greater 
frequency of injection site reactions was observed in OBDS treated patients (which occurred in 34.9% 
of the 360mg treated OBDS patients and 26.7% of the 180mg OBDS treated patients in M19-128). The 
nature of device related ADRS suggests local inflammatory reactions. However, the single dose design 
of M19-128 limits the interpretation in terms of clinical relevance of this apparent imbalance. 
CHMP assessment report on group of extensions of marketing authorisation  
EMA/887275/2022  
Page 250/258 
 
 
 
 
There was a difference in the exposure adjusted rate for hepatic events (4/100 PYs for placebo SC 
group compared to 9/100 PYs for 360mg SC in the 52 week Maintenance Safety Set. While this 
imbalance is noted, it is also agreed that the majority of enzyme elevations were transient, resolved 
without any change to study drug, and were asymptomatic (i.e., not accompanied with abdominal 
pain, jaundice, etc.). The percentage of subjects with potentially clinically relevant laboratory values in 
ALT, AST, and total bilirubin values were low (< 3%). For subjects with aminotransferase elevations ≥ 
5 × ULN, alternative etiologies or confounding factors were identified, or no clear causal association 
with risankizumab was determined. No confirmed Hy's law cases were identified. The majority of 
hepatic AEs were non-serious and related to liver enzyme increases, and 3 subjects (0.2%) in the ANY 
RZB group discontinued study drug due to a hepatic event. 
In terms of important potential risks, there were 4 cases of MACE in patients exposed to 180mg 
risankizumab and 1 on the placebo group. It can be agreed that the events occurred in patients with 
CV risk factors or a history of CV disease. When compared to the reported rate of MACE for the patient 
population (0.82/100 PY) (Kristensen 2013), the exposure-adjusted incidence rate observed is not 
immediately concerning (0.2/100 PY). MACE is listed as an important potential risk in the Summary of 
Safety Concerns which is agreed, though it is noted that while the estimation of the rates of MACE is a 
focus of the cohort study for the Long-Term Prospective Cohort Study in Patients with Psoriasis in Real 
World Setting it does not appear to be included as an objective for the long-term Prospective Cohort 
Study in Patients with Crohn's Disease. 
The most commonly reported infections in CD included upper respiratory tract infection (19.7%), skin 
infections (16.1%), and acute bronchitis (14.2%). In the Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Induction Period 
Safety Analysis Set a lower frequency of AEs in the infections and infestations SOC were reported in 
treatment arms compared to the placebo IV group (19.2% in 600mg IV and 18.3% in the 1200 mg 
group, compared to subjects in the placebo group 24.4%). Again, in the Placebo-Controlled 52-Week 
Maintenance Period Safety Analysis Set the rate of infection-related AEs was lower in both 
risankizumab treatment arms (51.4 E/100 PY for 180 mg SC, 57.7 E/100 PY for 360 mg SC) compared 
to the rate in the withdrawal (placebo SC) arm (76.0 E/100 PY). It can be agreed from the data 
presented that no meaningful change in frequency or severity of the currently known ADR for upper 
respiratory tract infections was identified. Upper respiratory infections are currently listed 4.8 with a 
frequency of very common. 
In terms of serious opportunistic infections, there were 3 SAEs of opportunistic infection in the ANY 
RZB group (a clinically asymptomatic case of disseminated histoplasmosis, severe SAE of 
bronchopulmonary aspergillosis that resolved after 62 days and did not lead to study drug 
discontinuation and a case CMV which resolved after 8 days and did not lead to study drug 
discontinuation) and 1 SAE in the placebo IV/SC (RZB-naïve) group (neutropenic sepsis). Overall, it is 
agreed that the data do not demonstrate a greater frequency of opportunistic infection and the 
incidence rate observed in All Treated Safety Analysis Set (0.5/100 PY in risankizumab patients is 
consistent with the background rate for this patient population based on published estimates (0.80/100 
PY) (Kirchgesner 2018). 
The rate of serious hypersensitivity reactions across any risankizumab exposure (<0.1 E/100 PY) was 
low.  
Immunogenicity to risankizumab did not appear to have any clinically relevant impacts on 
hypersensitivity reactions, though the low number of patient’s experiencing ADA precludes any 
conclusions in this regard.  
In general, though the incidence rate of malignancy was 0.5/100 PY for the ANY RZB group, which is 
not concerning in terms of the background rate reported for this patient population based on published 
estimates (1.33/100 PY).

3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The number of adolescent patients included in the Crohn’s disease program is minimal. A total of n=12 
received at least one dose of risankizumab and n=5 adolescent patients went past 52 weeks in 
maintenance. From data presented, there also appears to minimal experience from outside of the 
Crohn’s disease program in patients less than 18 years.   
While the population pharmacokinetics analysis did not identify age as having an independent impact 
on risankizumab exposures, unexpected age-specific safety issues cannot be ruled out on the basis of 
data collected in adolescent patients. The MAH excluded adolescents who were not at Tanner stage 5 
from the supporting clinical trials, though not all 16 year old adolescents will be Tanner stage 5. The 
MAH has outlined that all aspects of the Paediatric Investigational Plan are currently differed. As such, 
the MAH was requested to adjust the indication sought to ≥18 years. The MAH agreed to adjust the 
indication sought to ≥18 years. 
There remain uncertainties due to limited clinical experience with the OBDS which appears to have a 
greater potential for injection site reactions, this could potentially result in lack of compliance, however 
safety and compliance will be monitored for in the post marketing phase.  
A fourfold increased frequency of injection site reactions was observed in OBDS treated patients when 
compared to PFS treated patients treated in M19-128 and when compared to patients treated with 
either 180mg or 360mg SC as part of 52-Week Maintenance in M16-000 Sub-Study. Treatment 
emergent ADA incidence was also substantially higher in the 360 mg OBDS group relative to any other 
group in the CD clinical development programme. Exposure in elderly patients is limited with n=32 
patients aged >65 years in The Placebo-Controlled 52-Week Maintenance Period Safety Analysis Set 
and just n=5 aged >75 years. Given the potential for safety to differ in these patients due to factors 
such as increased susceptibility to adverse events (including important potential risks of serious 
infection), polypharmacy and other physiological differences, there is concern in terms of sufficiency of 
characterisation of safety in these patients. Especially as the data presented do appear to show some 
differences in observed safety findings, however the low number of elderly patients exposed (n=32 
patients for 600 mg IV and n=24 exposed to 1200 mg IV) add uncertainty to this finding. 
It is noted that race did not show a clinically relevant effect on risankizumab PK (see section 2 of this 
AR for discussion) though Black or African American patients are underrepresented in the safety data 
set (n=39 in induction period, n=51 in all treated) which adds uncertainty in terms of the 
characterisation of safety for these patients.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The data from the induction studies show a clear benefit for patients treated with RZB at 12 weeks. 
Additional improvements in key measures of clinical and endoscopic importance have also been 
demonstrated by the MAH in the induction studies.   
Statistical and clinically relevant results were demonstrated for the maintenance effect for the co 
primary endpoints. The secondary endpoints were nominally significant due to the testing strategy 
however they are considered as providing supportive evidence of efficacy for the 360 mg SC 
formulation. 
No new important risks were identified and no significant differences to the established safety profile 
were identified during the Crohn’s disease program information. There is currently a degree of 
uncertainty regarding the characterisation of the safety profile however this will be further clarified 
from post marketing data.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The CHMP considers that the new presentations, strengths and route of administration for the 
treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease who have had an 
inadequate response to, lost response to, or were intolerant to conventional therapy or a biologic 
therapy, or if such therapies are not advisable is approvable.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Skyrizi new strength (360mg and 600mg), new pharmaceutical form 
(concentrate for solution for infusion) and new route of administration (intravenous use) for the 
treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease who have had an 
inadequate response to, lost response to, or were intolerant to conventional therapy or a biologic 
therapy is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section ‘Recommendations’. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Skyrizi new strength (360mg and 600mg), new pharmaceutical form 
(concentrate for solution for infusion) and new route of administration (intravenous use) is favourable 
in the following indication(s): 
Skyrizi is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's 
disease who have had an inadequate response to, lost response to, or were intolerant to conventional 
therapy or a biologic therapy. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension(s) of the marketing authorisation for Skyrizi subject to 
the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2).

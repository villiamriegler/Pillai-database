Submission of the final report from a hospital-based 
12/03/2020 
n/a 
Final results from a hospital-based surveillance study 
surveillance study assessing the impact of Synflorix 
assessing the impact of Synflorix immunisation programme 
immunisation program in Kenya on pneumonia, 
invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and 
replacement disease. This submission is made to 
fulfil post-authorisation measure MEA 021.8, and 
propose an update of the Risk Management Plan 
(RMP) accordingly.  
Review of the safety concerns listed in the Synflorix 
RMP in alignment with the recommendations from 
EU-RMP with GVP module V revision 2 was also 
in Kenya on pneumonia, invasive pneumococcal disease 
(IPD) and replacement disease were presented and 
discussed. Data from the long-term surveillance study 
conducted suggests that the introduction of Synflorix in the 
routine immunisation programme in 2011 (3+0 schedule) 
with a simultaneous catch up campaign for children 
younger than 5 years of age was associated with a 
reduction in hospital admission with IPD, clinically-defined 
pneumonia and radiologically-confirmed pneumonia. The 
vaccine efficacy (VE) was estimated 48% against 
Page 8/57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
carried out, considering the closure of MEA 021.8 
and the RMP principle that safety concerns can be 
removed or reclassified when the safety profile and 
risks are well-characterised; the MAH revised the 
Synflorix RMP and removed all well-characterised 
risks.  
The RMP version 18 has been approved.

radiologically-confirmed pneumonia and 27% against 
clinically-defined pneumonia among children 2 through 59 
months of age. Nasopharyngeal carriage showed a 92% 
reduction in vaccine-type (VT) - Invasive Pneumococcal 
Disease (IPD) in children. There was no significant evidence 
of replacement disease in Kenya over the study period 
despite of the fact that carriage prevalence of non VT 
pneumococci increased. Across the 13-year observation 
period, there was a general health trend towards a 
consistent reduction of admission incidence rates, 
particularly for malaria, malnutrition, and clinically-defined 
pneumonia. The study used hospital admission for 
diarrhoea as a control condition. Correlation was observed 
between reduction of hospital admission for diarrhoea and 
the introduction of Synflorix, which indicates improved 
children’s health in Kenya unrelated to Synflorix 
administration.

assessed in a limited number of primed or unprimed 
subjects with congenital or acquired asplenia, splenic 
dysfunction or complement deficiencies: 6 subjects 2-5 
years of age and 40 subjects 6-17 years of age (Synflorix is 
indicated up to 5 years of age). Synflorix was shown to be 
immunogenic and no new safety concerns were observed in 
this study. In individuals with splenic dysfunction, a 3-dose 
schedule of Synflorix should be given as primary 
vaccination in infants starting vaccination before 6 months 
of age.

immunogenicity of Synflorix in children with increased risk 
for pneumococcal infections, i.e. Human Immunodeficiency 
Virus (HIV) infected or HIV exposed uninfected infants 
while study 10PN-PD-DIT-064 assessed the safety and 
immunogenicity of Synflorix in children with increased risk 
for pneumococcal infections, i.e. children with sickle cell 
disease (SCD). 
Information including immunogenicity and safety results 
from both studies was added to the product information. 
The safety profile of Synflorix was considered acceptable in 
the studied high risk paediatric populations, suggesting that 
the benefit-risk profile of Synflorix is favourable in these 
populations. The benefit-risk profile of Synflorix is also 
considered favourable when administered in a 2+1 
schedule beginning at 6 weeks of age. Administration of a 
booster dose (third or fourth dose) at 9 months of age does 
not adversely impact the safety profile and could provide 
additional benefit in terms of increased and prolonged 
protection. 
The CHMP considered the proposed changes to the SmPC to 
be acceptable with some modifications.

In Brazil, Synflorix was introduced into the national 
Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC with effectiveness 
data against pneumococcal vaccine serotypes and 
against vaccine related serotype 19A, and update of 
section 4.4 of the SmPC to include information on 
the immune response against serotype 19A observed 
in infants and children. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to make minor editorial changes in the 
SmPC, and to request extensions to the due dates 
for MEA 009: Study 10PN-PD-DIT-034 (111634) and 
MEA 018.5: Study 10PN-PD-DIT-064 (114056). A 
revised RMP version 13 was agreed during the 
procedure.

immunization programme (NIP) using a 3+1 schedule in 
infants (2, 4, 6 months of age and a booster dose at 12 
months) with a catch-up campaign in children up to 2 years 
of age. Based on almost 3 years of surveillance following 
Synflorix introduction, a matched case-control study 
reported a significant decrease in culture or PCR confirmed 
IPD due to any vaccine serotype, and IPD due to individual 
serotypes 6B, 14 and 19A. 
In Finland, Synflorix was introduced into NIP with a 2+1 
schedule in infants (3, 5 months of age and a booster dose 
at 12 months) without catch-up campaign. Before and after 
NIP comparison suggests a significant decrease in the 
incidence of any culture confirmed IPD, any vaccine 
serotype IPD and IPD due to serotype 19A. 
It has also been demonstrated that Synflorix induces an 
immune response to the cross-reactive serotype 19A with

vaccine does not replace the use of 23-valent 
pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines in children ≥ 2

SmPC, Annex 
Based upon the data that have become available since the 
II, Labelling 
granting of the initial Marketing Authorisation, the CHMP 
and PL 
considers that the benefit-risk balance of Synflorix remains 
positive, but considers that its safety profile is to be closely 
monitored for the following reasons: 
• 
Identified risks including febrile convulsions, 
apnoea in premature infants, and hypotonic hyporesponsive 
episode (HHE) were observed with increasing rates. 
Emerging safety concerns, such as Kawasaki disease need 
further follow-up. 
• 
Potential serotype replacement. 
Therefore, based upon the safety profile of Synflorix, which 
requires the submission of yearly PSURs, the CHMP 
concluded that the MAH should submit one additional 
renewal application in 5 years time. 
II/0069 
Update of sections 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC with

The MAH has presented new data regarding invasive 
invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) efficacy data, 
acute otitis media (AOM) efficacy data and carriage

impact data coming from 2 large Phase III clinical 
studies. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications

study 053. The data are considered relevant to include in 
the SmPC. The studies have partly been presented in other 
procedures e.g. variations applications 
EMEA/H/C/000973/II/0052 and II/0070, but the current 
evaluation was focussed on the data relevant to the 
proposed updates of the SmPC.  
In conclusion the IPD data from the COMPAS study support 
the previously presented data. The protective 
efficacy/effectiveness against AOM in the COMPAS and 053 
studies was lower than expected. Updated analyses of the 
studies were provided. The results for the catch-up 
vaccination schedules did not change substantially, but as 
discussed by the MAH, are not considered robust, especially 
due to the short follow-up period. The study was not 
designed to compare different vaccination schedules, and 
the confidence intervals are generally wide for the AOM 
endpoints. Therefore the results should not be presented in 
detail; however a brief summary should be included in the 
SmPC. The CHMP considered that risk benefit balance of 
Synflorix remains favourable in the approved indication. 
II/0070 
Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC to revise the 
23/01/2014 
27/10/2014 
SmPC and PL 
This variation summarizes the safety and reactogenicity 
safety information upon a safety pooled analysis 
from primary vaccination, booster and catch-up 
studies. The Package Leaflet was updated in 
accordance. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to 
the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package 
Leaflet. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
data for Synflorix up to the data lock point (DLP) of 
December 10, 2012 and thus accounts for clinical studies 
completed since the first licensure of Synflorix in December 
11, 2008. 
The safety data from these clinical studies has significantly 
increased the safety database for Synflorix. 
The safety review supported the revisions of section 4.8 of 
the SmPC. The numbers of subjects exposed to Synflorix 
and the number of doses received in clinical trials was 
updated. In addition, the percentages of the most common

(DLP) of December 10, 2011. The safety database for 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
Synflorix from clinical studies completed up to the DLP, 
consisted of 18 primary vaccination studies (including 7166 
subjects in Total vaccinated cohort primed with Synflorix), 
15 completed booster studies (5848 subjects in Booster 
Total vaccinated cohort receiving Synflorix) and five catch-
up studies (883 subjects in Catch-up Total vaccinated 
cohort receiving Synflorix). 
In addition, post-marketing surveillance data in MAH 
worldwide safety database up to the DLP of April 2012 has 
been reviewed for spontaneous reports related to 
anaphylaxis and angioedema. 
Changes to the SmPC dealing with local and systemic 
events noted in primary, booster and catch up vaccination 
studies were proposed. The proposed additions/revisions to 
the SmPC were endorsed by the CHMP. 
The CHMP considered there was sufficient evidence of a 
causal relationship between Synflorix administration for 
anaphylaxis and angioedema to warrant an update of the 
relevant sections of the Product Information. 
Overall, the studies conducted with Synflorix and the post-
marketing surveillance have demonstrated that the vaccine 
can be safely administered to infants and children up to 5 
years of age together with other routinely administered

Update of section 4.4 of the SmPC to add a warning 
20/09/2012 
25/10/2012 
SmPC and PL 
The MAH provided a safety review to support an insertion 
related to psychogenic syncope. The package leaflet 
was proposed to be updated in accordance.  
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update 
the list of local representatives in the Package 
Leaflet. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
of a warning statement regarding syncope associated with 
the injection of Synflorix. There has only been one possible 
report out of 63 million doses of Synflorix administered 
world-wide. The vast majority of doses were given to 
younger children, but some increase in the use in older 
children could be expected, as catch-up programs are 
introduced.  It is therefore highly unlikely that insertion of a 
warning will prevent any further injuries among the infants, 
but possibly among the older children.  
In conclusion, the CHMP considered the inclusion of a 
warning in section 4.4 acceptable with the specification of 
the age range when these reactions could be expected.  
The update of contact details of local representatives was 
accepted.

The MAH seeks to update section 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of 
16/12/2010 
24/01/2011 
SmPC and PL 
The current SmPC of 10Pn-PD-DiT in Europe has no 
the SmPC to include information on preterm infants 
based on the data provided in response to FUM 005 
and FUM 006 that have been assessed by the 
Rapporteur and reviewed by the CHMP. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
recommendation with respect to the posology for 
vaccination of preterm infants and no description of the 
immunogenicity and safety of vaccination in preterm 
infants. The MAH has received requests from immunisation 
experts and healthcare professionals from several European 
Member States to have clarification of vaccination status for 
preterm infants and inclusion of the data in the SmPC for 
10Pn-PD-DiT. 
The update of SmPC section 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC 
to include information on preterm infants is based on data 
of two studies (primary and booster studies) that evaluate 
the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of 10Pn-PD-
DiT when co-administered with DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine 
in preterm infants (born after a gestation period of 27-36 
weeks)  as a 3-dose primary immunisation course during 
the first 6 months of life and then a booster dose at the age 
of 16-18 months (Studies 10PN-PD-DIT-015 and 10PN-PD-
DIT-016).  
Having assessed these data the CHMP supports the 
inclusion of information on preterm infants in the SmPC

(sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1) to give clear guidance to 
prescribers how to use the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine in this 
vulnerable group. 
recommendation for use of Synflorix with 2+1 
schedule in routine infant immunisation programmes 
and to add paragraphs in section 5.1 to reflect 
immunogenicity data on the 2-dose primary 
vaccination schedule. 
The immunogenicity of Synflorix following a 2-dose 
primary vaccination schedule in subjects less than 6 
months of age was evaluated in studies 10PN-PD-
DIT-002 and -011. The recent study 10PN-PD-DIT-
046 assessed the persistence and immunological 
memory following 2+1 and 3+1 vaccination.  
Amendment to section 4.4 with a statement  that 
vaccination in high risk groups should be considered 
on an individual basis, with a cross-reference to 
section 4.2. 
To ensure the safe and proper administration of 
Synflorix using a pre-filled syringe, the MAH took the 
opportunity to update section 6.6 of the SmPC to 
include further instructions for the use of the pre-
filled syringe (with illustration). 
Some further minor amendments have been made in 
the SmPC to comply with the latest version of the 
QRD template. 
vaccination schedule in subjects less than 6 months of age 
was evaluated in studies 10PN-PD-DIT-002 and -011. The 
recent study 10PN-PD-DIT-046 assessed the persistence 
and immunological memory following 2+1 and 3+1 
vaccination. The product information has been updated 
accordingly.

1.  Introduction 
On 10 December 2015, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Fabrazyme, in accordance 
with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
After the CHMP meeting of March 2016 the following additional information was requested: 
Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic data were shown by dose group and not by age group, so it could not be assessed 
whether there is a difference in pharmacokinetics between the 5 - 11 and 12-18 year groups. The 
applicant is requested to show these data. 
Efficacy 
The findings of the clinical study have not been put into perspective with the current treatment and 
posology for this patient group of children with Fabry disease. The MAH should make an (indirect) 
comparison between the results obtained with the alternative dosing regimens (1.0 mg/kg/q4W and 
0.5 mg/kg/q2W) with the results of the currently approved 1.0 mg/kg/q2W for the same age 
populations and discuss these findings before a final decision can be made. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that study AGAL06207/EFC12821/FIELD, a Randomized, Multicenter, Multinational, 
Phase 3B, Open- Label, Parallel-Group Study of Fabrazyme (agalsidase beta) in Treatment-Naive Male 
Pediatric Patients with Fabry Disease Without Severe Symptoms, is a stand alone study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Due to the treatment regimen burden, (e.g., lengthy time of each infusion and the infusion frequency), 
the current recommended course of therapy (Fabrazyme 1.0 mg/kg every 2 weeks [q2w]) may 
discourage treatment of children who still present few symptoms of Fabry disease. Therefore it was 
considered that institution in childhood of a lower strength and/or less frequent infusions may still 
allow for prevention of late complications, while facilitating an early access to treatment, which may be 
critical to achieve the best outcomes in FD patients. As such, 2 alternative dose regimens of 
Fabrazyme, i.e. 0.5 mg/kg every 2 weeks [q2w] and 1.0 mg/kg every 4 weeks [q4w]) were applied in 
this study.

2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
A Randomized, Multicenter, Multinational, Phase 3B, Open-Label, Parallel-Group Study of Fabrazyme 
(agalsidase beta) in Treatment-Naive Male Pediatric Patients with Fabry Disease Without Severe 
Symptoms (AGAL06207/EFC12821) 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
A Randomized, Multicenter, Multinational, Phase 3B, Open-Label, Parallel-Group Study of Fabrazyme 
(agalsidase beta) in Treatment-Naive Male Pediatric Patients with Fabry Disease Without Severe 
Symptoms (AGAL06207/EFC12821) 
Description 
Methods 
This randomized, multicenter, multinational, open-label, parallel-group study is evaluating 2 alternative 
low dose regimens of Fabrazyme (0.5 mg/kg q2w and 1.0 mg/kg q4w) in treatment-naive male 
paediatric patients (≥5 and ≤18 years of age at study entry) with Fabry disease without severe 
symptoms. The study was comprised of a 45-day Screening period, a 5-year (260-week) treatment 
period, and a follow-up phone call approximately 4 weeks after completion of all study procedures.  
Patients who were determined to be eligible for the study based on Screening procedures were 
stratified by age at enrolment (5 to 11 years [children] and 12 to 18 years [adolescents]) and, within 
each stratum, were randomized to receive intravenous (IV) infusions of Fabrazyme at a dose of 0.5 
mg/kg q2w or 1.0 mg/kg q4w during the treatment period. All infusions of Fabrazyme were initially 
administered at the clinical site; however, patients who met specific criteria had the option of receiving 
infusions at home after Week 28/Month 6/Year 0.5 for the q2w infusion regimen and Week 52/Year 1 
for the q4w infusion regimen. All patients receiving home infusions continued to return to the study 
site for study evaluations. 
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) oversaw safety in this study through periodic and 
ad-hoc reviews of study data. The DMC was also consulted regarding possible dose increases in 
patients with suspected disease progression and/or advanced Fabry disease. 
All patients were monitored for Fabry disease progression. In cases of documented and significant 
progression of Fabry disease, a patient may have received a dose increase to the approved dosing 
regimen of 1.0 mg/kg q2w after consultation with the DMC and agreement by the Sponsor. Any patient 
switched to 1.0 mg/kg q2w continued to be evaluated in the study. 
All patients were encouraged to enter the Fabry Registry at the end of their participation in the study. 
Fabrazyme is approved in all regions where this study is being conducted. 
Objective(s) 
The objectives of this open-label study were to evaluate the efficacy (GL-3 clearance in skin, plasma, 
and urine), PK, and safety parameters (including immunogenicity) for 2 alternative dose regimens of 
Fabrazyme (0.5 mg/kg every 2 weeks [q2w] and 1.0 mg/kg every 4 weeks [q4w]) in treatment-naive

male paediatric patients (≥5 years to ≤18 years of age) with Fabry disease without severe symptoms. 
Exploratory clinical endpoints were also evaluated. 
Study design 
Randomized, multicenter, multinational, open-label, parallel-group study is evaluating 2 alternative low 
dose regimens of Fabrazyme (0.5 mg/kg q2w and 1.0 mg/kg q4w) in treatment-naive male paediatric 
patients (≥5 and ≤18 years of age at study entry) with Fabry disease without severe symptoms. 
Study population /Sample size 
The study enrolled Fabry patients with confirmed diagnosis prior to the development of severe 
symptoms involving major organs (kidney, heart and brain). 
Patients who met the following inclusion criteria were eligible for enrolment in this study: 
1.  The patient and/or patient’s parent(s)/legal guardian(s) provided written informed 
assent/consent prior to any protocol-related procedures being performed. 
2.  The patient had a confirmed diagnosis of Fabry disease as documented by leukocyte αGAL of 
<4 nmol/hr/mg leukocyte (preferred assay; results from a central laboratory). If the leukocyte 
αGAL activity assay was difficult to obtain, the patient may have been enrolled based on 
documented plasma αGAL <1.5 nmol/hr/mL, with the agreement of the Medical Monitor 
(results from a central laboratory). 
3.  The patient had evidence of GL-3 accumulation as documented by plasma GL-3 (>7.0 
mg/mmol) or urinary GL-3 (>0.03 mg GL-3/mmoL creatinine) levels (results from a central 
laboratory). 
4.  The patient was a male ≥5 and ≤18 years of age. 
Number of patients

Route(s) of administration: Intravenous infusion 
Dose regimen: 0.5 mg/kg q2w or 1.0 mg/kg q4w, Patients with documented and significant 
progression of Fabry disease may have received Fabrazyme at an increased dose of 1.0 mg/kg q2w, 
after consultation with the DMC and agreement of the Sponsor. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy: The primary efficacy endpoint was GL-3 accumulation in the superficial skin capillary 
endothelium, as independently evaluated by 3 pathologists using light microscopy (LM) of masked skin 
biopsy samples obtained at baseline (ie, Screening, Week 52, Week 156, and Week 260). 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included plasma GL-3 (total) and urine GL-3 at Screening and every 3 
months for the first year (through Week 52/Year 1) and every 6 months thereafter or at early 
withdrawal. 
Exploratory efficacy endpoints include the following: 
•  Renal function; 
•  Audiology; 
•  Body Mass Index (BMI); 
•  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI); 
•  Echocardiography (ECHO); 
•  Retinal imaging; 
•  Angiokeratoma; 
•  Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms; 
•  Quality of Life (QoL); 
•  Kidney biopsy; 
•  Plasma and Urine biomarkers 
Safety: Safety was evaluated based on physical examinations and clinical laboratory tests performed at 
Screening and every 3 months through the end of study; vital signs measured at each visit (pre- and 
post-infusion); centrally-read 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs); and routine monitoring of adverse 
events (AEs), concomitant medications and therapies, and serum IgG antibodies to rhαGAL. Additional 
immunogenicity testing was performed in consultation with the Sponsor's Global Pharmacovigilance 
and Epidemiology Department, and could include immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody, serum tryptase, 
and plasma complement activation in patients experiencing moderate, severe, or recurrent infusion-
associated reaction (IARs) suggestive of a hypersensitivity reaction; and skin testing, circulating 
immune complex, and/or inhibitory antibodies on an as needed basis. 
Pharmacokinetics: Blood samples for PK profiles of Fabrazyme were collected at Day 1 and at Week 
52/Year 1. Plasma concentrations of Fabrazyme were used to determine the following pharmacokinetic 
(PK) parameters using a non-compartmental method. 
Cmax (maximum plasma concentration observed), AUClast (area under the plasma concentration 
versus time curve from time zero to the last time point with concentration above the limit of 
quantification), AUC (area under the plasma concentration versus time extrapolated to infinity), t1/2z

(terminal half-life), CL (total body clearance from the plasma) and Vss (volume of distribution at 
steady-state). 
Statistical Methods 
All efficacy and safety endpoint analyses were conducted on the FAS. Hypothesis tests were 2-sided at 
the α=0.05 level. Efficacy analyses were performed on randomized patients receiving one or more 
infusions of Fabrazyme. The Per Protocol (PP) population included patients at least 80% compliant with 
drug dosing and without major protocol violations. The primary endpoint of GL-3 inclusions in the skin 
vascular endothelium of the skin was scored as 0 (none or trace) or 1, 2, or 3 (abnormal). A binomial 
matched pair procedure was used to compute a p-value for each treatment group based on shifts from 
Baseline to the timepoint for a zero-nonzero score. Shift tables and a listing of scores by patient were 
produced and graphs were presented as appropriate. Frequencies and percentages were presented by 
treatment group for categorical variables. Continuous variables were summarized by treatment group 
using descriptive statistics (N, mean, SD, median, range) and/or by summarizing the change from last 
observation prior to treatment to each visit. As appropriate, changes from Baseline were summarized 
by treatment group and graphs were presented. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
The study was conducted at 12 sites in 31 males, all between the ages of 5 and 18 years of age. The 
majority of patients (87.1%) were ≥80% compliant with treatment intake. 
Baseline data 
The majority of the study population was Caucasian. In each treatment group, the median age at 
enrollment was 12.0 years, with approximately half of the patients in each age stratification group (5 
to ≤11 years and 12 to≤18 years). The median age of patients when diagnosed with Fabry disease 
was 10.0 years (range: 0 to 17 years). All but one patient had one or more family members who had 
also been diagnosed with Fabry disease. Plasma αGAL activity for all 31 randomized patients was <1.5 
nmoL/hr/mL as required per protocol. All twenty-four patients with leukocyte αGAL activity data has a 
confirmed result <4.0 nmoL/hr/mg. 
Genotyping found a predominance of missense mutations (12 patients) in the q2w treatment group (2 
nonsense mutations, 2 deletions), and an equal distribution between missense and nonsense 
mutations in the q4w treatment group (7 patients each, as well as 1 deletion). 
Of the 31 randomized patients, all received 0.5 mg/kg q2w or 1.0 mg/kg q4w. Two patients required a 
dose increase from 0.5 mg/kg q2w to 1.0 mg/kg q2w due to disease progression; one patient, who 
received a dose increase due to weight loss (Week 114), and another patient, who received a dose 
increase due to recurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (Week 26). One patient discontinued 
treatment at the request of his parents after experiencing a serious IAR during the ninth infusion of 
Fabrazyme on a regimen of 1.0 mg/kg q4w. One patient from the 0.5 mg/kg q2w dose group  
discontinued treatment on Day 540 of treatment due to social/family issues and needle phobia. 
Thirteen patients received infusions at home, 8 of whom were randomized to the 0.5 mg/kg q2w 
infusion regimen and 5 of whom were randomized to the 1.0 mg/kg q4w regimen.

Pharmacokinetics 
The study AGAL06207/EFC12821 included a 45-day screening period, a 5-year (260-week) treatment 
period, and a follow-up phone call approximately 4 weeks after completion of all study procedures. 
Patients who were determined to be eligible for the study based on screening procedures were 
stratified by age at enrolment (5 to ≤11 years [children] and 12 to ≤18 years [adolescents]) and, 
within each stratum, were randomized to receive intravenous (i.v.) infusions of Fabrazyme at a dose of 
0.5 mg/kg q2w or 1.0 mg/kg q4w during the treatment period. Following the first infusion on Day 1, 
subsequent infusions were administered relative to Day 1 ±7 days for all patients. For patients 
randomized to q2w infusions, no 2 infusions were administered less than 7 days apart. 
Blood samples for PK profiles of Fabrazyme were collected at Day 1 and at Week 52/Year 1 at 0 
minutes (pre-dose), every hour after the start of the infusion, at the end of the infusion, 15 minutes, 
30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, and 8 hours post-infusion. Agalsidase beta plasma 
concentrations were determined using an enzymatic activity based PK method with low limit of 
quantitation (LLOQ) of 1.38 ng/ml. 
In both dosing groups, results from 15 patients were available, with an 50/50% ratio of aged 5 - 11 
and 15 - 18 years. Fabrazyme concentrations for 2 patients  on day 1, at the 1.0 mg/kg q4w dose 
were excluded due to missing sampling times. The individual agalsidase beta plasma concentration-
time curves at day 1 and week 52 plasma are shown in figure PK 1 and 2.

The pharmacokinetic variable are shown in table PK 1. 
Table Pk 1. Mean ± s.d. (geometric mean) [CV%] of Fabrazyme pharmacokinetic parameters on day 1 
and week 52. 
The ratios day 1/week 52 at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg q2w for Cmax was 1.44 and for AUC 1.42. The 
plasma exposure ratios day 1/week 52 at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg q4w for Cmax was 1.83 and for AUC 
1.88.  
The dose ratios 0.5mg q2w/1mg q4w at day 1 for Cmax was 1.48 and for AUC 2.23. The dose ratios 
0.5mg q2w/1mg q4w at week 52 for Cmax was 1.87 and for AUC 2.96.  
All patients were categorized as anti-rhαGAL IgG positive or negative based on anti-rhαGAL IgG 
antibody testing results at week 52. The geometric mean values of Cmax, AUC, CL and Vss at week 52 
for anti-rhαGAL IgG positive and negative patients in the two dose groups are summarized in table PK 
3. There were 4 of 15 and 3 of 15 anti-rhαGAL IgG negative patients from the 0.5 mg/kg q2w and 1.0 
mg/kg q4w treatment groups, respectively. Anti-rhαGAL IgG status did not appear to affect Fabrazyme 
CL and AUC. However, Vss in anti-rhαGAL IgG positive patients appeared to be higher than in anti-

rhαGAL IgG negative patients (geometric mean values of positive to negative ratio 2.20 and 1.84 for 
0.5 mg/kg q2w and 1.0 mg/kg q4w treatment groups, respectively); and Cmax appeared to be lower 
in anti-rhαGAL IgG positive patients (geometric mean values of positive to negative ratio 0.662 and 
0.886 for 0.5 and mg/kg q2w and 1.0 mg/kg q4w treatment groups, respectively).

CHMP comment: 
In paediatrics aged 5 - 18 years of age, 2 alternative dose regimens of Fabrazyme were applied, i.e. 
0.5 mg/kg every 2 weeks [q2w] and 1.0 mg/kg every 4 weeks [q4w]), compared to the recommended 
dose in adults of 1.0 mg kg every 2 weeks.  These alternative dose regimens were used to reduce 
treatment regimen burden, e.g., lengthy time of each infusion and the infusion frequency.  
Comparison with historic data in adults and paediatrics did not indicate unexpected findings, i.e. 
exposures and clearances observed in paediatrics were in the order of those of adults.  
At day 1, AUC increased proportional to the dose, while at week 52 AUC increased more than dose 
proportional (about 3-fold). In addition, increased exposures are observed after multiple dosing. This 
may be contributed to some saturation of metabolism.   
The data were shown by dose group and not by age group, so it could not be assessed whether there 
is a difference in PK between the 5 - 11 and 12-18 year groups. The applicant is requested to show 
these data.  
In this study, in anti-rhαGAL IgG positive patients, AUC and clearance seems not significantly affected, 
however this should be interpreted with caution, due to the limited number of patients with negative 
anti-rhαGAL IgG status. 
Overall, pharmacokinetic data did not show major issues and considered supportive to clinical data 
(see below).

Efficacy results 
GL-3 clearance from skin capillary endothelium:   
Histological evaluation of skin biopsies showed statistically significant shifts from non-zero to zero GL-3 
accumulation over the course of the study and relative to baseline, in superficial capillary endothelial 
cells and deep vessel endothelial cells, but not in the other skin cell types.  A total of 23/29 patients 
had a score of zero in superficial capillary endothelial cells at week 260 (inclusive of the 2 patients who 
had dose increase).   
Of note, eight patients (all without a dose increase and with data available after baseline) showed at 
least one non-zero score after treatment onset among which, 4 patients had a score of 2 (moderate 
accumulation), indicating an insufficient dose effect.  All 8 patients developed anti-rhαGAL IgG 
antibodies at peak titers ≥ 3200.  
GL-3 clearance from Plasma: 
Mean plasma GL-3 concentrations decreased rapidly and was most obvious in patients with lower peak 
anti-rhαGAL IgG titers.   
GL-3 clearance from Urine: 
Mean urine GL-3 also decreased rapidly in 27 patients, but higher anti-rhαGAL IgG levels impacted 
negatively the response to treatment. 
Exploratory efficacy endpoints: 
Mean GFR, whether calculated by plasma iohexol clearance (iGFR) or estimated from serum creatinine 
levels using age-appropriate formulae (eGFRBedside Schwartz formula or eGFRCKD-EPI formula) was 
measured above 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 in all patients at baseline and remained stable through the five 
years of treatment with Fabrazyme.  Estimation of GFR led to more variable data, based on SD around 
the mean and estimation by Bedside Schwartz formula appeared to generally underestimate GFR, 
whereas CKD-EPI formula appeared to generally overestimate GFR when compared to iohexol GFR.  
Thus, based on this dataset, it appears that performing iGFR as a multiple point analysis, as this is 
done consistently throughout this study, provides more accurate and reproducible evaluations of GFR 
in male paediatric patients with Fabry disease than estimation of GFR.  
Urinary protein excretion (PCR, ACR, and β2-microglobulin) remained low in all but 4 individuals who 
showed transient elevations of both ACR and PCR. There was a statistically significant decrease of PCR 
from baseline to Week 260, and a nominal decrease in ACR over the course of the study. 
Optional kidney biopsies were performed at baseline in 6 patients and at Week 260 in 7 patients aged 
between 10 and 17 years. At baseline semi-quantitative analysis by light microscopy showed numerous 
GL-3 inclusions to various degrees in all different kidney cell types that were examined in 4 patients. 
The remaining 2 patients had GL-3 accumulation in podocytes only or in podocytes and noncapillary 
smooth muscle cells. By Week 260, there was a reduction in GL-3 inclusions in the 6 patients who had 
a baseline biopsy performed as part of the study and 2 patients showed zero scores in podocytes. All 7 
patients who underwent kidney biopsy during the study showed zero-scores in interstitial kidney 
capillary and superficial skin capillary endothelium at all visits. Because EM analyses are quantitative, 
they prevail over LM analyses in all cases. Quantitative analysis by electron microscopy generally 
confirmed the decrease in volumes of GL-3 inclusions in podocytes in those patients who had light 
microscopy scores compatible with GL-3 clearance. In patients who had no podocyte clearance per 
light microscopy findings, electron microscopy showed an increase in GL-3 accumulation

No CS changes in cardiac morphology and function, as assessed by echocardiography, tissue Doppler 
imaging, and electrocardiogram were identified in any patient during the study period.  
Optional brain MRIs were performed for 21 of the 31 randomized patients aged 5 to 18 years at 
baseline (Screening), 20 patients at Week 132 and 23 patients at Week 260 and analyzed with regards 
to potential markers of early central nervous system involvement in Fabry disease (eg white matter 
lesions (WMLs), pulvinar sign, and basilar artery diameter).  One patient showed a WML of unclear 
etiology on T2/FLAIR in deviation with the inclusion criteria at baseline which remained stable during 
the course of the study.  No new WML and no pulvinar sign or strokes developed during the trial.  
Mean basilary artery diameters were found to remain stable.  Overall brain MRI results indicated 
stability in all assessed patients throughout the trial. 
The audiology findings in this study population remained overall stable, with individual fluctuations in 
occurrence of tinnitus and/or hearing loss, but no trend could be identified.  Only 2 patients had 
persistent hearing loss at 260 weeks and 1 patient persisting tinnitus throughout the trial.   
Overall, the data suggests improvement in some GI symptoms over time.  
Eighteen patients showed extension of angiokeratoma and the remaining 13 patients did not develop 
lesions or had stable preexisting lesions.  
Age-appropriate assessment of pain showed a nominal improvement over time in VAS score for the 
question “How do you feel now” and BPI assessment of “Pain right now”. 
Age-appropriate self-report instruments did not suggest any overall trends toward either a meaningful 
improvement or worsening of quality of life measures, including fatigue and core dimensions of 
functioning, with the exception of social functioning in which study participants reached scores 
comparable to healthy subjects.   
Growth parameters were stable for the majority of patients, inclusive of BMI which ranged within 5th-
95th percentile during the course of the study. The study included 6 patients who developed at or 
below the 5th percentile, as well as 5 patients who developed at or above the 95th percentile 
Generally, no substantial difference in terms of GL-3 clearance was noted between the two dosing 
regimens, but no formal statistical comparisons were performed. 
Safety results 
Overall, the safety profile of Fabrazyme was favorable for the pediatric patients receiving a dosing 
regimen of 0.5 mg/kg q2w or 1.0 mg/kg q4w in this study. 
Both alternative low dose regimens of Fabrazyme, 0.5 mg/kg q2w and 1.0 mg/kg q4w, were well 
tolerated in pediatric patients with Fabry disease without severe symptoms, with Fabrazyme having a 
favorable safety profile during the five years of treatment.  Less IARs were reported in the 1.0 mg/kg 
q4w arm, consistent with a lower number of infusions as compared to the 0.5 mg/kg q2w arm. 
Two patients required a dose increase due to disease progression which consisted of decrease in BMI 
and recurrence of GI symptoms.  All of the 31 randomized patients reported at least one TEAE 
(pyrexia, diarrhea, vomiting, cough, headache, and nausea), the majority of which were mild or 
moderate in severity.  Severe TEAEs (severe paraesthesia, severe abdominal pain, severe nausea, 
events of cellulitis, Herpes simplex, pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infection, erysipelas, sepsis, 
anemia, conjunctival hyperemia, tinea pedis, GI hemorrhage, dermatitis, nausea, malaise, medical 
device complication, back pain, pain in extremity, soft tissue inflammation, and oropharyngeal pain)

were reported for 3 (20.0%) patients, and occurred in 2 (25.0%) patients receiving the 0.5 mg/kg q2w 
infusion regimen compared to 1 [14.3%] patient receiving the 1.0 mg/kg q4w infusion regimen.  
Treatment-related TEAEs and IARs were each reported for approximately 60% of the patients in the 
study, and the incidence of these events was similar between treatment groups.   
Overall, no new safety concerns were identified for Fabrazyme based upon evaluation of AEs, vital 
signs, physical examination findings, clinical laboratory values, ECGs, echocardiograms, and 
concomitant medication use for the pediatric patients in this study. The adverse events were consistent 
with the known safety profile of Fabrazyme. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
In conclusion, a majority of patients showed sustained clearance of GL-3 from superficial skin capillary 
endothelium, but in a subset of patients with anti- rhαGAL IgG antibodies the lower (than approved) 
Fabrazyme dosing regimens were less effective. This study also suggests a positive impact of early 
institution of Fabrazyme treatment on the kidney in terms of histology and function, and possibly on 
prevention of clinical deterioration. No new safety concerns were identified for Fabrazyme based upon 
evaluation of AEs, vital signs, physical examination findings, clinical laboratory values, ECGs, 
echocardiograms, and concomitant medication use for the pediatric patients in this study. The adverse 
events were consistent with the known safety profile of Fabrazyme. 
However, the MAH did not compare the findings in this study with the accepted 1.0 mg/kg q2W 
regimen.  
3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
Two lower than approved dosing regimens were studied (0.5 mg/kg q2w and 1.0 mg/kg q4w) for 5 
years. Sixteen (16) patients were allocated to the 0.5 mg EOW regimen, 15 patients received the 1.0 
mg/kg q4w regimen. Two patients had an increase in dose because their plasma GL-3 did not 
sufficiently decrease during treatment.  
Pharmacokinetic data by age group showed in general an increased clearance in the 5 - 11 years age 
group compared to the 12 - 18 years age group. However due to a high variability the data should be 
interpreted carefully. Further, no great difference could be established between both regimens 
considering the effect on renal function, cardiac anatomy and function, hearing loss, gastro-intestinal 
symptoms and quality of life. No final conclusions regarding efficacy can be drawn due to lack of a 
placebo group (assay sensitivity) and it can be discussed whether all patients were true candidates for 
treatment but the data at least show a persistent pharmacodynamic effect. 
A retrospectively indirect comparison with the results of study AGAL10601 suggests more uniform GL-3 
clearance from superficial skin capillary endothelium when using the recommended dosing regimen of 
Fabrazyme (1.0 mg/kg q2w), as compared to the lower dose regimens (0.5 mg/kg q2w and 1.0 mg/kg 
q4w). Further (indirect) comparison with the adult population and a comparable adolescent population 
treated with the registered 1.0 mg/kg EOW did not reveal clinical important differences. 
Based on the above efficacy it can be concluded that institution in childhood of a lower strength and/or 
less frequent infusions may allow for benefits in some but not all patients, but a true comparison with 
the higher, currently accepted dose is lacking. As such, it cannot be approved a separate dose 
recommendation, although the data justify mention in section 5.1.

  Fulfilled: 
The applicant proposed the following text for section 4.2: 
Lower dosing regimens have been used in clinical studies. In one of these studies 
performed in adult male patients, after an initial dose of 1.0 mg/kg every 2 weeks for 6 
months, 0.3 mg/kg every 2 weeks may maintain clearance of GL-3 in certain cell types 
in some patients. In another study performed in paediatric male patients aged 5 to 18 
years, 0.5 mg/kg every 2 weeks and 1.0 mg/kg every 4 weeks suggest benefits of early 
institution of agalsidase beta. However, the outcomes of GL-3 clearance from superficial 
skin capillary endothelium were less uniform across patients at lower doses compared to 
the outcomes obtained, in general, at the recommended dosing regimen of 1.0 mg/kg 
every 2 weeks. The long term clinical relevance of these findings has not been 
established (see section 5.1). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Fabrazyme in children aged 0 to7 years have not yet been 
established. Currently available data are described in sections 5.1 but no 
recommendation on posology can be made in children aged 5 to 7 years. No data are 
available in children 0 to 4 years 
A dosing advice in section 4.2 is considered not acceptable as a robust scientific justification is 
lacking. Benefits have been observed, but questions remain regarding its size, the outcomes of the GL-
3 clearance and the long-term clinical relevance. Reference to 5.1 is allowed however. 
The applicant proposed the following text for section 5.1: 
In an additional 5-year open-label paediatric study, 31 male patients aged 5 to 18 
years were randomized prior to the onset of clinical symptoms involving major 
organs and treated with two lower dose regimens of agalsidase beta, 0.5 mg/kg 
every 2 weeks or 1.0 mg/kg every 4 weeks. Efficacy results were similar between the 
two treatment groups. Superficial skin capillary endothelium GL-3 scores were 
reduced or maintained to zero during treatment in 18/27 patients completing the 
study without a dose increase. Both baseline and 5-year kidney biopsies were 
obtained in a subset of 6 patients: in all, kidney capillary endothelium GL-3 scores 
were reduced to zero but highly variable effects were observed in podocyte GL-3, 
with a reduction in 3 patients. Ten (10) patients met per protocol dose increase 
criteria, two (2) had a dose increased to the recommended dose of 1.0 mg/kg every 
2 weeks. Overall, the results suggest a benefit of early treatment institution, but with 
less uniform outcomes across patients in skin GL-3 capillary endothelium clearance 
with lower dosing regimens of agalsidase beta compared to the recommended dosing 
regimen of 1.0 mg/kg every 2 weeks. 
Some reference to the FIELD study is acceptable and the first part of the proposal of the 
applicant is acceptable. The part of the interpretation of the results (Overall, the results 
suggest a benefit of early treatment institution) should be deleted. The following text is 
proposed:

MAH responses to Request for supplementary information 
Question 1 
Pharmacokinetic data were shown by dose group and not by age group, so it could not be assessed 
whether there is a difference in pharmacokinetics between the 5 - 11 and 12-18 year groups. The 
applicant is requested to show these data. 
Summary of the Applicant’s Response 
In response to the above mentioned Agency request, Sanofi Genzyme submits an addendum to the 
latest version of the CSR, version 02 dated 11-Mar-2016, (as Annex I) where the pharmacokinetics 
data by age group are included. The two tables below (Table 1, Table 2) are added to the addendum to 
the CSR based on this additional pharmacokinetics analysis.

Faster elimination was observed in the younger age population with CL ratio of 1.47 – 1.76-fold 
increase compared to the older age group, except for the 1.0 mg/kg q4w dose in Week 52 the younger 
age group seemed to have reduced CL by 0.704-fold. 
Likewise, the younger age population had reduced AUC with the ratio of 0.567 – 0.679-fold, shorter 
terminal half-life t1/2z with the ratio of 0.711 – 0.851-fold compared to the older age group, except for 
the 1.0 mg/kg q4w dose in Week 52 the younger age group seemed to have increased AUC by 1.42-
fold and extended t1/2z by 1.33-fold. 
The Cmax ratio appeared to be consistent on Day 1 for the two age groups with the two dose 
regimens, but reduced Cmax by 0.517-fold at 0.5 mg/kg q2w and increased Cmax by 1.76-fold for the 
younger age group compared to the older age group. Overall, Vss for the younger age population was 
higher from 1.04 - 1.96-fold. 
The results from this subgroup analysis, particularly the Day 1 parameters reflecting the initial doses of 
agalsidase beta, are consistent with the hypothesis for agalsidase alfa that younger subjects may have 
faster, more efficient M6P-mediated removal of the enzyme from the plasma and entry into the 
lysosomes (1). The implication of the presumed 1-way transit into the lysosomes is that plasma AUC 
does not accurately reflect total exposure as it does with conventional drugs. Similarly, the faster 
plasma clearance seen following the initial dose in children compared to adults should not be used as 
evidence that higher doses should be used in children (1).

Assessment of the Applicant’s Response   
The applicant submitted the pharmacokinetic data per age group. In general, an increased clearance is 
observed in the 5 - 11 years age group compared to the 12 - 18 years age group at day 1 for the 0.5 
mg/kg/q2w and 1 mg/kg/q4w dose group and at week 52 for the 0.5 mg/kg/q2w dose group. At week 
52 for the 1 mg/kg/q4w dose group a decreased clearance was observed.  The observed increased 
clearance in children is in line with the report by Ries et al, stating that "The average clearance in 
children, 3.7 ± 1.5 mL/min/kg (mean ± SD), was significantly greater than that measured in 33 adults 
(2.3 ± 0.7 mL/min/kg1 P < .0001)". It should be mentioned that the data from this study and making 
conclusions should be carefully interpreted, as the variability is very high, making straight conclusion 
difficult. 
Conclusion 
The question is considered resolved. The limited data indicated a higher clearance in younger children, 
however due to a high variability, conclusions should be carefully interpreted. 
Question 2 
The findings of the clinical study have not been put into perspective with the current treatment and 
posology for this patient group of children with Fabry disease. The MAH should make an (indirect) 
comparison between the results obtained with the alternative dosing regimens (1.0 mg/kg/q4W and 
0.5 mg/kg/q2W) with the results of the currently approved 1.0 mg/kg/q2W for the same age 
populations and discuss these findings before a final decision can be made. 
Summary of the Applicant’s Response 
In response to the above mentioned Agency request, Sanofi Genzyme submits a report, as Annex II, 
that indirectly compares the results of the study with alternative dosing regimens (0.5 mg/kg q2w and 
1.0 mg/kg q4w) in Fabry Disease (FD) paediatric patients (Study number EFC12821, FIELD) to the 
results of a previously completed study using the currently approved regimen of 1.0 mg/kg q2w in FD 
paediatric patients (AGAL-016-01). In the report, only efficacy endpoints similar between the two 
studies are included. These efficacy endpoints include skin biopsy GL-3 scoring (primary endpoint), 
plasma GL-3, renal function, cardiac function, pain, Quality of Life, gastrointestinal symptoms, and 
body mass index. This indirect and retrospective comparison did not address parameters that were not 
similar between the two studies, e.g. it excluded kidney biopsy analysis that was performed only in 
FIELD but not in AGAL01601. 
Overall, the two studies explored mostly male young populations affected with Fabry disease with 
complete αGAL enzyme deficiency, and prior to the onset of severe complications. Study designs, 
populations (age, gender, number of subjects), inclusion/exclusion criteria and severity of organ 
involvement at baseline (eg proteinuria/albuminuria, LVH), endpoints (nature, timing and methodology 
to assess them), treatment scheme (dose increase in FIELD as needed), follow-up time (1 vs 5 years) 
and peak IgG titers, were substantially different between the two studies and do not allow for formal 
comparisons and definitive conclusions. 
Nevertheless, the comparison suggests more uniform GL-3 clearance from superficial skin capillary 
endothelium when using the recommended dosing regimen of Fabrazyme, as compared to the lower

dose regimens; no substantial difference was noted for other parameters compared. These results are 
consistent with the outcomes of previous trials performed in adults, which similarly showed less 
uniform cellular GL-3 clearance when treating patients with a lower dosing regimen (AGAL-017-01), as 
compared to the standard dosing regimen used in the phase 3 and extension trials (AGAL-1-002-98 
and AGAL-005-99). 
Assessment of the Applicant’s Response   
An indirect comparison of the results of the FIELD study with those of AGAL-01601 was made. In the 
Field study adolescent male patients without disease burden (apart from symptoms such as pain, GI 
manifestations and tiredness) were included. In AGAL-016-01 both male (n=16) and female (n=2) 
paediatric patients administered Fabrazyme at the currently approved dose (1 mg/kg q2w) for a period 
of 48 weeks were included.  
GL-3 clearance from superficial skin capillary endothelium showed slightly different effects in both 
studies with the lower doses in the FIELD study not reaching full clearance in all patients after one year 
while in the AGAL-016-01 study all patients reached full clearance after 2 years of treatment (see 
Table 1). 
In the FIELD study GL-3 clearance from plasma was abnormal in 30 of 31 (96.8%) patients (plasma 
GL-3 levels (>7.0 μg/mL) at Baseline. By Week 52/Year 1, normal plasma GL-3 levels (≤7.0 µg/mL) 
were reported for 29 of the 30 (93.5%) patients with available data at both Baseline and Week 
52/Year 1. 
In study AGAL-016-01, 14 of the 16 patients (88%; all males) had abnormally elevated plasma GL-3 
levels (ie, > 7.03 μg/mL) at baseline. At Week 16, 80% of the patients had normalized; and 4 weeks 
later (Week 20), all patients had reached a normal level.  
In both studies, plasma GL-3 was reduced to normal and similar levels with treatment. 
In the FIELD study mean GFR, was, among others, estimated from serum creatinine levels using age-
appropriate formulae (eGFR Bedside Schwartz formula or eGFR CKD-EPI formula). eGFR was above 90 
mL/min/1.73 m2 in most patients at baseline and remained stable through the 5 years of treatment 
with Fabrazyme. During the 2 years of study AGAL01601 no clinically significant change in mean eGFR 
was observed. 
In the FIELD study urinary albumin and protein excretion was assessed by examining albumin (ACR) 
and protein (PCR) creatinine ratios (the median of the spot urine values was used for each time point). 
ACR remained below 30 mg/g throughout the trial in all but 4 individuals who showed mild transient (3 
patients) or progressive (1 patient, 0504) elevations into the microalbuminuria range. PCR evolution 
generally mirrored that of ACR. 
In study AGAL01601 proteinuria was already slightly abnormal at Baseline in this young population, 
since 8 out of 16 patients had levels had levels >150 mg/24 hr (Figure 7). A statistically significant 
decline (p=0.002) in mean proteinuria levels from 151.0 mg/24 hr at Week 0 to 90.0 mg/24 hr at 
Week 24 was observed. A more modest decrease compared to Week 0 was also seen at Week 48 (from 
151.0 mg/24 hr to 126.0 mg/24 hr). 
Overall, eGFR was stable and within the variability of the eGFR assessment in both studies; 
proteinuria/albuminuria tended to be less stable in FIELD compared to AGAL01601. 
No clinically significant changes in cardiac morphology as assessed by echocardiography were 
identified in any patient during the FIELD study. In particular, no patient developed left ventricular 
hypertrophy determined from left ventricular wall thickness or left ventricular mass index. In study

AGAL01601 five (5) patients exhibited mild left ventricular hypertrophy at Baseline, based upon left 
ventricular and/or interventricular wall thicknesses, and values fluctuated over time. Median LVMI was 
37.5 g/m2.7 at Baseline, 33.7 g/m2.7 at Week 24, and 34.7 g/m2.7 at Week 48. The changes were not 
statistically significant.  
The FIELD study excluded patients with LVH (mean baseline LMI was 33.2 g/m2.7) and there were no 
clinically significant changes in cardiac echography parameters over the course of 260 weeks/5 years. 
The AGAL01601 study included some patients with LVH (mean baseline LMI was 38.2 g/m2.7) at 
baseline and a slight (not statistically significant) decrease of mean LVMI was seen at Week 48.

In both studies, there appeared to be a slight improvement in responses to the pain questionnaires but 
the data should be interpreted with care due to differences in the questionnaires, mode of 
administration, patient population at baseline and at study end, and study duration. 
In the FIELD study, there did not appear to be any overall trends toward either a meaningful 
improvement or worsening of quality of life measures, including fatigue and core dimensions of 
functioning, with the exception of social functioning in which study participants reached scores 
comparable to healthy subjects. In AGAL01601, general health showed a statistically significant 
improvement between pre-treatment and the end of the study consistent with the improvement in 
pain. There were also improvements in school attendance and low energy activities. 
In AGAL01601, there was a statistically significant improvement in GI symptoms. However, in the 
FIELD study, although there was a trend toward improvement in GI symptoms, 2 patients required a 
dose increase to standard approved dose of 1mg/kg every other week (1 patient due to an increase in 
GI symptoms, and another patient due to decreased BMI associated with nausea). From the time of 
dose increase, data from these two patients were excluded from the analyses, which limits the 
interpretability of the comparison between studies. Dose increase standard approved dose of 1mg/kg 
every other week was not an option in AGAL01601. 
Overall, the two studies explored mostly young, male populations affected with Fabry Disease with 
complete αGAL enzyme deficiency, and prior to the onset of severe complications. 
This indirect and retrospective comparison was performed only on parameters similar between the two 
studies, e.g. it excluded kidney biopsy analysis that was performed only in FIELD study but not in the 
AGAL01601 study. 
Study designs, populations (age, gender, number of subjects), inclusion/exclusion criteria and baseline 
characteristics (e.g. ACR, PCR, LVH), endpoints (nature, timing and methodology to assess them), 
treatment scheme (dose increase in FIELD as an option), follow-up time (1 vs 5 years) and peak IgG 
titers, were substantially different between the two studies and do not allow for formal comparisons 
and definitive conclusions. 
Nevertheless, the comparison suggests more uniform GL-3 clearance from superficial skin capillary 
endothelium when using the recommended dosing regimen of Fabrazyme (1.0 mg/kg q2w), as 
compared to the lower dose regimens (0.5 mg/kg q2w and 1.0 mg/kg q4w). No substantial difference 
could be demonstrated for other parameters compared. 
Conclusion 
The type of comparison (indirect and retrospective) does not allow for a scientifically well-based 
conclusion. The alternative dosing as evaluated in the FIELD study does not indicate a clinical 
important loss of efficacy compared to the registered does of 1.0 mg/kg/EOW used in study 
AGAL01601, but final conclusions cannot be made. No safety comparison was made.

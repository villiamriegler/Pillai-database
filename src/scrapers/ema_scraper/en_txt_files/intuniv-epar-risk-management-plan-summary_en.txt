Summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Intuniv 
(guanfacine) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Intuniv, which details the measures to be 
taken in order to ensure that Intuniv is used as safely as possible. For more information on RMP 
summaries, see here. 
This RMP summary should be read in conjunction with the EPAR summary and the product information 
for Intuniv, which can be found on Intuniv’s EPAR page. 
Overview of disease epidemiology 
Intuniv is a medicine used to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a behavioural 
disorder that involves short attention span and inability to concentrate, restlessness and constant 
talking and movement, and impulsive behaviour. ADHD is one of the most common behavioural 
disorders affecting children and adolescents. ADHD starts during childhood and may continue into 
adulthood. Individuals with untreated ADHD have higher risk for cigarette smoking and alcohol and 
substance abuse. Young people with ADHD are also at a higher risk for suicidal behaviour. ADHD is 
associated with other mental disorders such as anxiety, depression and learning disability. It is 
estimated that 5 percent of children aged 6-17 years have ADHD in Europe. 
Summary of treatment benefits 
Several studies have shown Intuniv improving ADHD symptom scores (ADHD-RS-IV) in children and 
adolescents.  
In a study of 337 children aged 6 to 17 years, the reduction in ADHD symptoms with Intuniv treatment 
after 10 to 13 weeks was 24 points compared with a reduction of 15 points seen with placebo (a 
dummy treatment) and 19 points seen with atomoxetine (an ADHD medicine). In another study of 312 
adolescents aged 13 to 17, the reduction in ADHD scores at 13 weeks was 25 points with Intuniv and 
19 points with placebo. Two other short-term studies involving 631 patients also showed Intuniv at 
various doses improving ADHD scores more than placebo.  
Intuniv was also evaluated in terms of treatment failures (based either on worsening of ADHD 
symptoms or patients stopping treatment). In a long-term maintenance study in 301 children and 
adolescents aged 6 to 17 years treatment failures occurred in 49% of patients taking Intuniv compared 
with 65% of those taking placebo. 
Unknowns relating to treatment benefits 
There is little or no information on the use of this medicine in pregnant women, children with liver or 
kidney disease, or children under 6 years of age.

Summary of risk minimisation measures by safety concern 
All medicines have a summary of product characteristics (SmPC) which provides physicians, 
pharmacists and other healthcare professionals with details on how to use the medicine, and also 
describes the risks and recommendations for minimising them. Information for patients is available in 
lay language in the package leaflet. The measures listed in these documents are known as ‘routine risk 
minimisation measures’. 
The SmPC and the package leaflet are part of the medicine’s product information. The product 
information for Intuniv can be found on Intuniv’s EPAR page. 
This medicine has special conditions and restrictions for its safe and effective use (additional risk 
minimisation measures). Full details on these conditions and the key elements of any educational 
material can be found in Annex II of the product information which is published on Intuniv’s EPAR 
page; how they are implemented in each country however will depend upon agreement between the 
marketing authorisation holder and the national authorities. 
These additional risk minimisation measures are for the following risks: 
Bradycardia, syncope, hypotension/decreased blood pressure, withdrawal blood pressure 
increase, sedative events, and weight increase 
Risk minimisation measure: Educational material for healthcare professionals 
Objective and rationale: to address the risks of bradycardia, syncope, hypotension/decreased blood 
pressure, withdrawal blood pressure increase, sedative events, and weight increase. 
Description: The educational materials are to remind healthcare professionals about the screening to 
be performed before deciding if the patient is a candidate to receive Intuniv and on the examinations 
to be performed periodically during treatment.

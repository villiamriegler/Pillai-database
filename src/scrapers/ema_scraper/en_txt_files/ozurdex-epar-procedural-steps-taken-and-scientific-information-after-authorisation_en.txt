are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Following observations of the use of Ozurdex in the clinical 
injection procedure video from the list of elements of 
PL 
practice, the MAH proposed to omit the intravitreal injection 
the educational material package in the conditions 
and restrictions for the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product. Additional updates to the Risk 
Management Plan (RMP) were made to consolidate 
the information in the educational material as well as 
in response to previous requests following the 
assessment of RMP version 1.9 and PSUR #4. 
C.I.z - Changes (Safety/Efficacy) of Human and

procedure video, which was no longer considered necessary 
to educate treating physicians on the correct application 
procedure. The CHMP agreed to the removal of the video, 
and thus the update of Annex II, and considered that the 
remaining material (consisting of a poster, an injection 
guide and a copy of the SmPC) was sufficient. In addition, 
the combination of the educational sets for both indications 
in uveitis and retinal vein inclusion and streamlining of the 
information on adverse drug reactions, as proposed by the 
MAH, was considered by the CHMP to help avoiding the 
provision of frequent updates and repetitive information to 
patients and physicians. Other updates to the risk 
management plan were considered in line with previous 
requests by the CHMP and PRAC. Minor changes to the 
package leaflet to better reflect the information in the 
SmPC and to update the list of local representatives were 
agreed as well.

SmPC, Annex 
Based on post marketing case reports involving device 
order to: 
 - add two contraindications (section 4.3)  
• 
Aphakic eyes with rupture of the posterior 
lens capsule 
• 
Eyes with Anterior Chamber Intraocular Lens 
(ACIOL) and rupture of the posterior lens capsule; 
- amend the wording of section 4.4 following the 
addition of the new contraindications in section 4.3; 
- add 2 new ADRs (section 4.8) “Hypotony of eye 
(associated with vitreous leakage due to injection)” 
and “Complication of device insertion (implant 
misplacement)” and amend the description of 
II, Labelling 
dislocation the MAH updated the description of the following 
and PL 
side effect “device dislocation (device migration)” by 
amending the text as follows “ with or without corneal 
oedema” in order to better reflect the pathology associated 
with device migration. In some of the reported cases the 
eyes were either without lens or were having the natural 
ocular lens replaced with man-made intraocular lens. The 
aim of these two contraindications is to minimize the risk of 
device migration in patients either lacking or having 
replaced the natural ocular lens. Based on this new safety 
data the MAH included two new contraindications in 
patients lacking the crystalline lens or with implanted lens 
Page 10/12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
“Device dislocation (migration of implant)” ADR by 
adding “with or without corneal oedema”. 
C.I.3.b - Implementation of change(s) requested

45/46, or amendments to reflect a Core SPC - 
Change(s) with new additional data submitted by the 
MAH 
and with rupture of the posterior lens capsule. Based on 
case reports of complication of device insertion and of 
decreased intraocular pressure the MAH included in the 
SmPC the terms ‘complication of device insertion (device 
misplacement)’ and “Hypotony of eye (associated with 
vitreous leakage due to the injection)” respectively as side 
effects.

II/0005 
The MAH proposed the update of sections 4.4 and 
17/11/2011 
22/12/2011 
Within this variation the Company has included in the 
4.8 of the SmPC in order to add a warning with 
regards to implant migration to reflect the changes 
proposed in PSUR 1 (27 July 2010 to 27 January 
2011). The MAH also proposed the update of section 
4.2 of the SmPC in order to include advice on the use 
of povidone iodine drops 5% to disinfect the 
periocular skin, eyelid and ocular surface prior to the 
injection procedure. The Package Leaflet was 
proposed to be updated in accordance.  
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update 
the list of local representatives in the Package 
Leaflet. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to 
the SmPC, and Package Leaflet. 
C.I.3.b - Implementation of change(s) requested 
SmPC, sections 4.4 and 4.8, a warning concerning the risk 
for implant migration from the posterior chamber of the 
eye into the anterior chamber. The need for such update 
was identified based on the review of a total of eight 
medically confirmed cases of device dislocation that have 
been reported with Ozurdex since the first marketing 
approval was obtained. 
The Company, taking advantage of this procedure, has also 
included in section 4.2 of the SmPC a piece of advice on the 
use of povidone iodine drops 5% to disinfect the periocular 
skin, eyelid and ocular surface prior to the injection 
procedure. The proposed advice regarding the use of 
povidone-iodine in section 4.2 of the SmPC promotes the 
safe use of the implant and is in-line with administration in 
the pivotal clinical trials.

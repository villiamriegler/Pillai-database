PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN BY PRODUCT
Summary of risk management plan for ZEPATIER (ELBASVIR 
AND GRAZOPREVIR)
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for ZEPATIER. The RMP details 
important risks of ZEPATIER, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information 
will be obtained about ZEPATIER's risks and uncertainties (missing information).
ZEPATIER’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how ZEPATIER should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for ZEPATIER should be read in the context of all this 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
ZEPATIER's RMP.
I.
The Medicine and What It Is Used For
ZEPATIER is authorised for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) infection in adult
and paediatric patients 12 years of age and older who weigh at least 30 kg (see product 
labeling for the full indication). It contains elbasvir and grazoprevir as the active substance 
and it is given by film-coated tablet 50mg elbasvir and 100mg grazoprevir. 
II.
Risks Associated With the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further 
Characterise the Risks 
Important risks of ZEPATIER, together with measures to minimise such risks and the
proposed studies for learning more about ZEPATIER 's risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
• Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;
• Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
• The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly;
• The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with 
or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.

ELBASVIR/GRAZOPREVIR
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of ZEPATIER is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below.
II.A
List of Important Risks and Missing Information
Important risks of ZEPATIER are risks that need special risk management activities to 
further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of ZEPATIER. Potential risks are 
concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available 
data, but this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing 
information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently 
missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

Risk factors and risk groups
Virologic failure after therapy with a 12 week regimen of once-daily 
ZEPATIER (without ribavirin) among CHC genotype 1-, genotype 4-, and 
genotype 6-infected subjects is rare; however, failure is often accompanied by 
emergence of NS3 and/or NS5A RAVs not detected prior to therapy.

Risk factors and risk groups
The most frequent risk factors include chronic viral hepatitis (types B and C), 
alcohol intake and aflatoxin exposure.  Cirrhosis is an important risk factor for 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and may be caused by chronic viral hepatitis, 
alcohol, inherited metabolic diseases such as hemochromatosis or alpha-1-
antitrypsin deficiency, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.  Overall, one-third 
of cirrhotic patients will develop HCC during their lifetime. Long-term follow-
up studies have demonstrated that approximately 1–8% per year of patients 
with cirrhosis develop HCC (e.g. 2% in HBV-infected cirrhotic patients and 3–
8% in HCV infected cirrhotic patients). In general, features of liver disease 
severity (low platelet count of less than 100 X103, presence of esophageal 
varices), in addition to older age and male gender, correlate with the risk of 
development of HCC among patients with cirrhosis. Other risk factors include 
excessive alcohol consumption, diabetes, obesity, and smoking.

Risk factors and risk groups
After resection, tumor recurrence rate exceeds 70% at 5 years including 
recurrence due to dissemination and de novo tumors. The most powerful 
predictors of recurrence are the presence of microvascular invasion and/or 
additional tumor sites besides the primary lesion. This suggests that the 
majority of recurrences are due to dissemination from the primary tumor and 
not to metachronous tumors developing in a liver with cirrhosis. Furthermore, 
recurrence due to dissemination is more likely to appear during the first 3 years 
of follow-up. 
In a published study, Child-Pugh Class B, more severe liver fibrosis, lower 
platelet count, and previous HCC were each significantly associated with HCC 
development, at univariate analysis. In the multivariate analysis, Child-Pugh 
class (p = 0.03, OR: 4.18, 95% CI: 1.17–14.8) and history of HCC (p <0.0001, 
OR: 12.0, 95% CI: 4.02–35.74) were associated with HCC recurrence. Among 
the 59 patients with previous HCC, younger age and more severe liver fibrosis 
were significantly associated with HCC recurrence, both at univariate and at 
multivariate analysis.

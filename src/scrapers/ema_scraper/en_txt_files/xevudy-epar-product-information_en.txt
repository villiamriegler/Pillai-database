CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications  
Xevudy is indicated for the treatment of adults and adolescents (aged 12 years and over and weighing 
at least 40 kg) with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who do not require oxygen 
supplementation and who are at increased risk of progressing to severe COVID-19 (see section 5.1). 
The use of Xevudy should take into account information on the activity of sotrovimab against viral 
variants of concern (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration  
Xevudy should be administered under conditions where management of severe hypersensitivity 
reactions, such as anaphylaxis, is possible and patients can be monitored during and for at least one 
hour after administration (see section 4.4). 
It is recommended that Xevudy is administered within 5 days of onset of symptoms of COVID-19 (see 
section 5.1).  
Posology 
Adults and adolescents (from 12 years and 40 kg body weight) 
The recommended dose is a single 500 mg intravenous infusion administered following dilution (see 
sections 4.4 and 6.6). 
Special populations  
Elderly

No dose adjustment is required in elderly patients (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population   
The safety and efficacy of Xevudy in children under 12 years old or weighing less than 40 kg have not 
yet been established (see section 5.2). No data are available. 
Method of administration  
For intravenous use. 
This medicinal product must be diluted prior to administration.  
Once diluted, it is recommended that the solution is administered over 30 minutes with a 0.2-μm in-
line filter. 
Xevudy must not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus injection. 
For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis  
Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with administration of 
sotrovimab (see section 4.8). If signs or symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction 
or anaphylaxis occur, administration should be discontinued immediately and appropriate medications 
and/or supportive care should be given. 
Infusion-related reactions 
Infusion-related reactions (IRRs) have been observed with intravenous administration of monoclonal 
antibodies (see section 4.8). These reactions may be severe or life threatening. If an IRR occurs, the 
infusion may be interrupted, slowed or stopped. 
Antiviral resistance 
Decisions regarding the use of Xevudy should take into consideration what is known about the 
characteristics of the circulating SARS-CoV-2 viruses including regional or geographical differences 
and available information on sotrovimab susceptibility patterns (see section 5.1). 
When molecular testing or sequencing data are available, they should be considered to rule out SARS-
CoV-2 variants that are shown to have reduced susceptibility to sotrovimab.

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
Pharmacokinetic interactions 
No interaction studies have been performed. Sotrovimab is not renally excreted or metabolised by 
cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes; therefore, interactions with medicinal products that are renally 
excreted or that are substrates, inducers, or inhibitors of CYP enzymes are unlikely.  
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
In vitro pharmacodynamic studies showed no antagonism between sotrovimab and remdesivir or 
bamlanivimab. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of sotrovimab in pregnant women. Animal studies have not been 
evaluated with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). In a cross-reactive binding assay 
using a protein array enriched for human embryofoetal proteins, no off-target binding was detected. 
Since sotrovimab is a human immunoglobulin G (IgG), it has the potential for placental transfer from 
the mother to the developing foetus. The potential treatment benefit or risk of placental transfer of 
sotrovimab to the developing foetus is not known.   
Sotrovimab should be used during pregnancy only if the expected benefit to the mother justifies the 
potential risk to the foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether sotrovimab is excreted in human milk or absorbed systemically after 
ingestion. Administration of sotrovimab while breast-feeding can be considered when clinically 
indicated. 
Fertility 
There are no data on the effects of sotrovimab on human male or female fertility. Effects on male and 
female fertility have not been evaluated in animal studies. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
Xevudy has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile 
The safety of the 500 mg dose of sotrovimab was evaluated in a placebo-controlled randomised study 
in 1049 non-hospitalised patients with COVID-19 (COMET-ICE) (see section 5.1). The most common 
adverse reactions were hypersensitivity reactions (2%) and infusion-related reactions (1%). The most 
serious adverse reaction was anaphylaxis (0.05%). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The adverse reactions in Table 1 are listed by system organ class and frequency. Frequencies are 
defined as follows: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to 
<1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000).

b Variant has not been named by the WHO. 
c The BN.1 variant contains the K356T substitution. 
Antiviral resistance 
Cell culture studies: No viral breakthrough was observed when virus was passaged for 10 passages 
(34 days) in the presence of fixed concentration of antibody at the lowest concentration tested (~10x 
EC50). Forcing the emergence of resistance variants through an increasing concentration selection 
method identified E340A as a sotrovimab mAb resistance mutant (MARM). An E340A substitution 
emerged in cell culture selection of resistant virus and had a >100-fold reduction in activity in a 
pseudotyped virus-like particle (VLP) assay. 
6 
 
 
 
 
Pseudotyped VLP assessments in cell culture were performed using Wuhan-Hu-1, Omicron BA.1, and 
Omicron BA.2 spike proteins. The epitope sequence polymorphisms K356T, P337H/K/L/N/R/T, 
E340A/K/G/I/Q/S/V, T345P and L441N, in the Wuhan-Hu-1 spike conferred reduced susceptibility to 
sotrovimab based on observed fold-increase in EC50 value (shown in parentheses): P337K (>304), 
E340K (>297), T345P (225), E340V (>200), P337R (>192), P337L (>192), E340I (>190), E340A 
(>100), L441N (72), E340S (68), E340Q (>50), E340G (18.21), P337T (10.62), K356T (5.90), P337N 
(5.57) and P337H (5.13). The following epitope substitutions conferred reduced susceptibility to 
sotrovimab based on the observed fold-increase in EC50 value (shown in parenthesis): P337H (>631), 
K356T (>631), P337S (>609), E340D (>609), and V341F (5.89) in the Omicron BA.1 spike variant, 
and P337H (>117), P337S (>117), P337T (>117), E340D (>117), E340G (>117), K356T (>117), and 
K440D (5.13) in the Omicron BA.2 spike variant. 
Clinical studies: SARS-CoV-2 viruses with baseline and treatment-emergent substitutions at amino 
acid positions associated with reduced susceptibility to sotrovimab in vitro were observed in COMET-
ICE (Table 3). Of the 32 sotrovimab-treated patients with a substitution detected at amino acid 
positions 337 and/or 340 at any visit baseline or post-baseline, only 1 met the primary endpoint for 
progression of hospitalisation for >24 hours for acute management of any illness or death from any 
cause through Day 29. This patient had E340K detected post-baseline and was infected with the 
Epsilon variant of SARS-CoV-2.

Clinical efficacy 
Study 214367 (COMET-ICE) was a Phase II/III randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study 
which evaluated sotrovimab as treatment for COVID-19 in non-hospitalised, non-vaccinated adult 
patients who did not require any form of oxygen supplementation at study entry. The study included 
patients with symptoms for ≤ 5 days and laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and was 
conducted when the wild-type Wuhan-Hu-1 virus was predominant, with the highest frequency of 
variants being Alpha and Epsilon. Eligible patients had at least 1 of the following: diabetes, obesity 
(BMI>30), chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or 
moderate to severe asthma, or were aged 55 years and older.    
Patients were randomised to a single 500 mg infusion of sotrovimab (N=528) or placebo (N=529) over 
1 hour. In the Intent to Treat (ITT) population at Day 29, 46% were male and the median age was 
53 years (range: 17-96), with 20% aged 65 years or older and 11% over 70 years. Treatment was given 
within 3 days of COVID-19 symptom onset in 59% and 41% were treated within 4-5 days. The four 
most common pre-defined risk factors or comorbidities were obesity (63%), 55 years of age or older 
(47%), diabetes requiring medicine (22%) and moderate to severe asthma (17%). 
The adjusted relative risk reduction in hospitalisation or death by Day 29 in the ITT population was 
79% (95% CI: 50%, 91%). The difference was driven by rates of hospitalisation, with no deaths in the 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
sotrovimab arm and two deaths in the placebo arm up to Day 29. No patients in the sotrovimab arm, 
versus 14 in the placebo arm, required high flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation up to Day 29.

Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Xevudy in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of COVID-19 (see section 
4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
Absorption 
Based on noncompartmental analyses, following a 1 hour IV infusion of 500 mg the geometric mean 
Cmax was 165 µg/mL (N = 360, CVb% 36.2), and the geometric mean Day 29 concentration was 
40.3 µg/mL (N = 469, CVb% 39.7). 
Distribution 
Based on non-compartmental analysis, the mean steady-state volume of distribution was 7 L.  
Biotransformation 
Sotrovimab is degraded by proteolytic enzymes which are widely distributed in the body.  
Elimination 
Based on non-compartmental analysis, the mean systemic clearance (CL) was 90.3 mL/day, with a 
median terminal half-life of approximately 56.5 days.  
Special populations 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elderly patients 
Based on population pharmacokinetic analyses, there was no difference in sotrovimab 
pharmacokinetics in elderly patients. 
Renal impairment 
Sotrovimab is too large to be excreted renally, thus renal impairment is not expected to have any effect 
on elimination. Furthermore, based on population pharmacokinetic analyses there was no difference in 
sotrovimab pharmacokinetics in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. 
Hepatic impairment 
Sotrovimab is degraded by widely distributed proteolytic enzymes, not restricted to hepatic tissue, 
therefore changes in hepatic function are not expected to have any effect on elimination. Furthermore, 
based on population pharmacokinetic analyses there was no difference in sotrovimab 
pharmacokinetics in patients with mild to moderate elevations in alanine aminotransferase (1.25 to 
< 5 x ULN).  
Paediatric population 
The pharmacokinetics of sotrovimab have not been evaluated in patients aged less than 18 years.  
The recommended dose for adolescents aged from 12 years and from 40 kg body weight is predicted 
to result in serum concentrations of sotrovimab similar to those in adults based on an allometric 
scaling approach, which accounted for effect of body weight changes associated with age on clearance 
and volume of distribution. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
Carcinogenesis/mutagenesis 
Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with sotrovimab. 
Reproductive toxicology 
Nonclinical reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have not been conducted with 
sotrovimab. 
Animal toxicology and pharmacology 
No toxicity with sotrovimab was identified in a cynomolgus monkey 2-week repeat-dose IV infusion 
toxicology study with 105-day recovery period at doses up to 500 mg/kg, the no observed adverse 
effect level (NOAEL) and highest dose tested. The Cmax and total exposure AUC [sum of AUC0-168h 
after Dose 1 and AUC0-last after Dose 2 (Day 8)] values at the NOAEL of 500 mg/kg were 
13500 µg/mL and 216000 day*µg/mL, respectively.

1.  What Xevudy is and what it is used for 
Xevudy contains the active substance sotrovimab. Sotrovimab is a monoclonal antibody, a type of 
protein designed to recognise a specific target on the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the virus that causes 
COVID-19.  
Xevudy is used to treat COVID-19 in adults and adolescents (from 12 years and weighing at least 
40 kg). It targets the spike protein that the virus uses to attach to cells, blocking the virus from entering 
the cell and making new viruses. By preventing the virus from multiplying in the body, Xevudy can 
help your body overcome the infection and prevent you from getting seriously ill. 
2.  What you need to know before you are given Xevudy

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
Celdoxome pegylated liposomal (in short Celdoxome) contains doxorubicin hydrochloride 2 mg/mL 
concentrate for dispersion for infusion. The application is a hybrid application which refers to the reference 
medicinal product Adriamycin 2 mg/mL solution for injection. Adriamycin and Celdoxome pegylated liposomal 
differ in terms of formulation as Adriamycin contains doxorubicin hydrochloride in a non-liposomal 
formulation, while Celdoxome contains doxorubicin hydrochloride in a pegylated liposomal formulation. 
Therefore, Adriamycin could not be used as “reference formulation” in the bioequivalence study and Caelyx 
was used instead for comparative physico-chemical, non-clinical and bioequivalence studies. 
The medicinal product has been designed to have the same indications and posology as Caelyx.  
The active substance of Celdoxome pegylated liposomal is doxorubicin hydrochloride, a cytotoxic 
anthracycline antibiotic obtained from Streptomyces peucetius var. caesius. The exact mechanism of the 
antitumour activity of doxorubicin is not known. It is generally believed that inhibition of DNA, RNA and 
protein synthesis is responsible for the majority of the cytotoxic effects. This is probably the result of 
intercalation of the anthracycline between adjacent base pairs of the DNA double helix thus preventing their 
unwinding for replication. 
As a pegylated liposomal, doxorubicin showed reduced cardiotoxicity and an improved pharmacokinetic 
profile compared to conventional doxorubicin (Gabizon et al, 19971, Gabizon et al, 20042, Duggan, 20113, 
Tacar et al, 20134). The liposomal form allows doxorubicin to remain in the circulation system for longer 
periods of time, which facilitates the delivery of a greater amount of the drug to cancerous cells or tumours 
(Sabeti et al, 20145). It has shown significant clinical benefit for patients with higher risk for anthracycline-
induced cardiotoxicity and has moreover been shown to improve efficacy and reduce certain adverse events.  
The applicant applied for the same indications as the ones approved for Caelyx. 
The recommended indications for Celdoxome pegylated liposomal are, in adults:  
•  As monotherapy for patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC), where there is an increased 
cardiac risk. 
• 
• 
For treatment of advanced ovarian cancer in women who have failed a first-line platinum based 
chemotherapy regimen. 
In combination with bortezomib for the treatment of progressive multiple myeloma (MM) in patients 
who have received at least one prior therapy and who have already undergone or are unsuitable for 
bone marrow transplant.

• 
For treatment of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) in 
patients with low CD4 counts (<200 CD4 lymphocytes/mm3) and extensive mucocutaneous or 
visceral disease. 
Celdoxome pegylated liposomal may be used as first-line systemic chemotherapy, or as second line 
chemotherapy in AIDS-KS patients with disease that has progressed with, or in patients intolerant to, prior 
combination systemic chemotherapy comprising at least two of the following agents: a vinca alkaloid, 
bleomycin and standard doxorubicin (or other anthracycline) (see SmPC section 4.1).  
It is recommended that Celdoxome pegylated liposomal should only be administered under the supervision of 
a qualified oncologist specialised in the administration of cytotoxic agents. 
Celdoxome pegylated liposomal exhibits unique pharmacokinetic properties and must not be used 
interchangeably with other formulations of doxorubicin hydrochloride (see SmPC section 4.2). 
Posology: 
Breast cancer/Ovarian cancer 
Celdoxome pegylated liposomal 2 mg/ml is administered intravenously at a dose of 50 mg/m2 once every 4 
weeks for as long as the disease does not progress and the patient continues to tolerate treatment. 
Multiple myeloma 
Celdoxome pegylated liposomal 2 mg/ml is administered at 30 mg/m2 on day 4 of the bortezomib 3 week 
regimen as a 1 hour infusion administered immediately after the bortezomib infusion. The bortezomib 
regimen consists of 1.3 mg/m2 on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 every 3 weeks. The dose should be repeated as long 
as patients respond satisfactorily and tolerate treatment. Day 4 dosing of both medicinal products may be 
delayed up to 48 hours as medically necessary. Doses of bortezomib should be at least 72 hours apart. 
AIDS-related KS 
Celdoxome pegylated liposomal 2 mg/ml is administered intravenously at 20 mg/m2 every two-to-three 
weeks. Avoid intervals shorter than 10 days as medicinal product accumulation and increased toxicity cannot 
be ruled out. Treatment of patients for two-to-three months is recommended to achieve a therapeutic 
response. Continue treatment as needed to maintain a therapeutic response. 
Guidelines for Celdoxome pegylated liposomal 2 mg/ml dose modification 
To manage adverse events such as palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE), stomatitis or haematological 
toxicity, the dose may be reduced or delayed. Guidelines for Celdoxome pegylated liposomal 2 mg/ml dose 
modification secondary to these adverse reactions are provided in the tables included in section 4.2 of the 
SmPC.  
2.2.  Quality aspects

The in-house methods proposed by the finished product manufacturer (assay, related substances, and 
identification of doxorubicin·HCl) were satisfactorily described and validated. The suitability of the methods 
used for the control of microbiological quality and bacterial endotoxins of the active substance was 
demonstrated. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities 
testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data demonstrating compliance with the specification have been provided for three full-scale 
batches. 
2.2.2.4.  Stability 
The CEP does not indicate re-test period.  
Stability data from nine commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored 
in the intended commercial package under long term conditions (25 ± 2 ºC / 60 ± 5% RH) and for up to six 
months under accelerated conditions (40 ± 2 ºC/75±5% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
Stability batches were tested for the following stability indicating parameters: description, pH, water content, 
related  substances,  assay,  Total  Aerobic  Microbial  Count  and  Total  Yeast  and  Mold  Count.  The  analytical 
methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. The data provided does not show any 
trend and results for all tested parameters met the specification at all timepoints. 
The photostability study as per ICH Q1B Light Option 1 was performed. The results of this study support the 
claim that the active substance (AS) is not sensitive to light as no decreases in the doxorubicin hydrochloride 
assay value were detected nor growing of impurities while the Mass Balance was retained.  
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.2.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as a translucent red suspension. Each single-dose vial contains 20 mg or 50 
mg doxorubicin hydrochloride at a concentration of 2 mg/mL and fill volumes of 10 mL and 25 mL 
respectively.

The pegylated liposome carriers are composed of cholesterol; fully hydrogenated soy phosphatidylcholine 
(HSPC); and N-(carbonyl-methoxypolyethylene glycol 2000)-1, 2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-
phosphoethanolamine sodium salt (MPEG-DSPE). 
Additional excipients used in the formulation are ethanol and nitrogen as processing aids, ammonium 
sulphate as a gradient material for active loading of doxorubicin, histidine as a buffer, hydrochloric acid 
and/or sodium hydroxide for pH control, and sucrose to maintain isotonicity. The product also contains water 
for injections.  
This is a generic medicinal product. The European reference medicinal product is Caelyx (EU/1/96/011/001-
004 by Baxter Holding B.V.). 
The goal of the development studies was to design a generic product that is equivalent to the reference 
medicinal product. Pharmaceutical formulation development studies have been conducted to evaluate the 
different unit operations to manufacture doxorubicin-loaded pegylated liposome. In addition, the stability of 
the generic formulation was compared to the reference medicinal products for assay and related substances 
data near expiry. 
The excipients were chosen based on the excipients listed in the Reference Medicinal Product, Caelyx. All 
excipients are widely used materials in pharmaceutical formulation, most of the described in Ph. Eur., with a 
long story of safe use in injectable administration. Stability data demonstrates that the finished product is 
chemically and physically stable under long term storage; therefore, the stability data supports the 
compatibility of the AS with the excipients. No novel excipients are used in the production of the finished 
product.  
Comparative characterisation data between the generic medicinal product and reference product has been 
provided on registration batches and indicate that the physicochemical and biological properties of the 
generic t and reference products are comparable.  
As required in the “Reflection paper on the data requirements for intravenous liposomal products developed 
with reference to an innovator liposomal product (EMA/CHMP/806058/2009/Rev02)” various physicochemical 
properties of Doxorubicin 2 mg/mL concentrate for dispersion for infusion (Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin 
Hydrochloride), 20 mg/10mL and 50 mg/25 mL have been determined. In-vitro liposome characterisation 
was conducted on the test and reference products. 
Analytical results demonstrate that the generic medicinal product can be considered pharmaceutical 
equivalent to the reference product. The results of Caelyx and Celdoxome CQAs were presented in 
comparative tables with results of all parameters tested during release. Nonetheless, due to the limited 
number of available batches in combination with single determination tests the applicant considered that a 
statistical evaluation was difficult, and therefore, the best available assessment of comparability of critical 
physico-chemical characteristics was a qualitative evaluation. Moreover, to substantiate this position, the 
applicant considered that the comparability between test product and reference product is better assessed 
through in vivo comparability gathered from the performed bioequivalence studies between the test product 
and the reference product, which is the main criteria for assessing pharmaceutical similarity of efficacy of a 
medicinal product. This was not considered satisfactory and data from comparative studies was requested by 
the CHMP as a Major Objection (MO). Particularly, the set of Quality Attributes (QAs) subject to analysis, 
definition/elaboration of the similarity condition, the sampling strategy, the similarity criterion applied per QA 
should have been predefined in the requested protocol. In addition, sample size representativeness (including 
impact in conclusions) should have been also addressed along with a pre-specification of the similarity 
criterion for each (critical) QA selected for comparative data analysis and the submission of the results and 
Assessment report

their statistical treatment of all parameters tested during release which were employed in the comparison. 
Suitable in-process controls or finished product specification acceptance criteria were requested to be set to 
certify that future batches will also be covered by the variation observed in the reference product.  
The applicant provided the comparative data analysis in their response. However, it was considered that 
although the selected Critical Quality Attributes (CQA) were considered acceptable, the statistical methods 
employed for the comparison were not acceptable. The CHMP maintained the MO and the applicant was 
requested to replace the statistical treatment proposed with a statistical treatment recommended by the 
CHMP. For zeta potential and free doxorubicin specifically the applicant was asked to increase the number of 
observations in order to show similarity. As requested a revised comparability report was provided following 
the recommendations from the CHMP. The data gathered from the revised comparability exercise 
demonstrated that the generic and reference medicinal product should be considered comparable and the 
previously raised MOs were resolved. 
Furthermore, according to the above reflection paper in addition to the characterisation studies conducted 
under proposed storage conditions, comparative stress test studies of both generic and reference medicinal 
products, should be conducted in order to compare physical and chemical degradation under stress 
conditions; this was also raised by CHMP as MO. In response, additional comparative stress test studies were 
carried out as requested in accordance with the above Reflection Paper. The provided comparative stress 
test results to support comparable physical and chemical degradation of test and reference product were 
accepted. Therefore, the MO was considered resolved. 
The development of the manufacturing process has been described in sufficient detail. The manufacturing 
process includes sterile filtration and vial filling under aseptic conditions. As liposomes are temperature-
sensitive, terminal sterilisation is not suitable for the proposed finished product. The choice of the sterilisation 
method has been properly justified based on the Decision Tree for Sterilisation of Aqueous Products in the 
Guideline (EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/850374/2015) and supported by experimental data and literature 
information.  
The absence of overfill was justified; it has been shown that the extractable volume (Ph. Eur. 2.9.17 test) of 
can be withdrawn from both the 20 mg or 50 mg vials.  
Information on the filters selected during development for manufacturing process and on filter validation was 
provided. The extractables study performed by sterile filters confirmed that the amount of extractables is 
very low. 
The selection of the in-vitro release method was based on literature which has been provided. The 
development and optimisation of in vitro release of the AS from the finished product (2mg/mL) was provided 
and found adequate. Method development and validation reports to support the selection of the in vitro 
release method have been provided. The discriminatory power of the method was adequately demonstrated 
against changes in composition and manufacturing process parameters. For the comparison of dissolution 
profiles, f2 (and f1) was employed to show similarity of profiles between of test and reference product 
batches. 
Compatibility and stability studies conducted after dilution with 5% dextrose injection were provided for two 
concentrations. There was no significant change in the parameters tested and the results are found to be well 
within the specification. 
Information sustained by experimental data on the osmolality of the diluted infusion was provided. Osmolality 
for three of the registration stability batches of finished product diluted in 5% dextrose (sucrose) solution for 
infusion at different concentrations are presented showing that there is a minimal change to the osmolality of 
Assessment report

Page 16/46 
 
 
 
the infusion solution due to the drug product. As the reference medicinal product has a similar formulation 
and undiluted osmolality value, a minimal effect on the osmolality of the infusion solution is also expected. 
The finished product is provided in Type I glass vial with a bromobutyl rubber stopper and aluminium and PP 
flip-off cap containing a volume of 10 ml (20 mg) or 25 ml (50 mg). Compliance for primary packaging 
material with the current EU regulations and Ph. Eur. requirements is confirmed.  
The selection of the container closure system was adequately justified based on data obtained from various 
studies which included compatibility assessment with rubber stoppers and glass vials, stability data and an 
extractable study. Details on the extraction study have been submitted and the results found to be 
acceptable. The extractables study performed by bioburden and sterile filters manufacturer confirmed that 
the amount of extractables is very low. Given the acute dosing nature of the finished product, the extractable 
profile of the stopper, and the leachable data generated for the finished product, the toxicological risk 
associated with patient exposure to leachables, which have originated from the container closure system and 
manufacturing components such as filters and tubing, are negligible and insufficient to warrant the need for 
further leachable data to be generated on commercial batches which is accepted. 
2.2.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product is manufactured by one manufacturing site: Baxter Oncology GmbH, Westfalen, 
Germany.  
The manufacturing process consists of 9 main steps: preparation of ammonium sulfate buffer, preparation of 
sucrose buffer, lipid mix, hydration/extrusion, diafiltration, drug loading into liposomes, preparation of and 
addition of histidine buffer, sterile filtration and filling.   
The process is considered to be a non-standard manufacturing process due to the aseptic processing step. 
The manufacturing process and in-process controls correspond to the normal standards of pharmaceutical 
technology for liposomal preparations and are suitable to guarantee an appropriate quality of the finished 
product. 
The critical process parameters for the compounding process of the finished product, operating ranges and 
maximum hold times were provided as were the tests and acceptance criteria performed at each critical 
parameter of the manufacturing process; these are acceptable. 
Confirmation was provided that nitrogen used during manufacture is filtered. The acceptance criteria for 
bioburden prior to filtration is in accordance with the Note for Guidance on Manufacture of the Finished 
Dosage Form. 
Aspects like washing and sterilisation of equipment, facility and equipment’s validation, washing and 
depyrogenation of glass vials were either briefly or not covered in the dossier since these are covered by 
GMP; this is acceptable. However, actual results of three media fill simulations, as well as the sterilizing 
conditions for the primary packaging materials (stoppers and caps) and the corresponding validation report of 
the sterilisation process of primary packaging material were provided. Sterilisation/depyrogenation 
validations are conducted at decreased times and/or temperatures, in comparison with the times and 
temperatures used for production runs. 
Information on hold times from the end of pre-filtration up to the sterile final filtration of the product was 
provided as well as solution compatibility, bacterial filter retention and extractable and leachable reports 
generated for the final sterilizing filter.   
Assessment report

The expiration period is calculated accordingly in line with the regulations described in CPMP/QWP/072/96 
Note for Guidance on Start of Shelf-Life of the Finished Dosage Form. 
Process validation data on the product has been presented for four full scale batches for the 20 mg fill volume 
and three full scale batches for the 50 mg fill volume. Overall, it has been demonstrated that the 
manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible 
manner.  
2.2.3.3.  Product specification 
The finished product release and shelf life specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage 
form: appearance, (visual), volume in container (Ph. Eur.), identification of AS (UPLC, UV diode array), pH 
(Ph. Eur.), osmolality (Ph. Eur.), particulate matter (Ph. Eur.), residual ethanol (GC-FID), uniformity of 
dosage unit (Ph. Eur.),instrumental turbidity (Ph. Eur.), assay (UPLC), related substances (UPLC), free 
doxorubicin (UPLC-FLR), encapsulation doxorubicin (HPLC), lipid assay (HPLC-CAD), lipid degradants (HPLC-
CAD), particle size distribution (dynamic light scattering), ammonium ion concentration (HPLC), sulfate ion 
concentration (HPLC),  zeta potential (particle analyser),  bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.), sterility and in vitro 
release (Ph. Eur.). 
The specifications were set in line with the requirements of the Ph. Eur. and/or USP monographs, ICH guidelines 
and batch analysis data from developmental studies and registration stability studies, as well as data from the 
reference products.  
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed following a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Data for six Celdoxome process 
validation batches were provided and a maximum daily dose (MDD) of 86.5mg/day was considered. For all 
elemental impurities tested, the results obtained were found to lower than the limit of quantitation which for 
all elements is 10% of the specification limit, which obviously were in all cases <30% of the acceptance 
criteria based on the defined PDEs for the product. Thus it has been concluded that no additional controls are 
required in the finished product specification. 
No risk assessment has been provided for the potential presence of nitrosamines. Considering the advanced 
cancer indication of Celdoxome this issue has not been raised as a concern. 
The analytical methods have been adequately described and non-pharmacopoeia methods have been 
validated in accordance with the requirements of the relevant ICH guidelines. The methods were found to be 
suitable for the control of the product and are acceptable. However the CHMP recommended and the 
applicant committed to consider the following points for the next revalidation of the chromatographic 
methods: The validity of the conclusions for validation parameters tested based on the SST will be 
summarised as appropriate; It will be stated clearly whether the concentrations tested for Linearity were 
obtained by a serial dilution from a mother solution. It will be stated clearly that the accuracy results are 
obtained testing solutions independent from those used in the study of linearity. This is accepted. 
Satisfactory  batch  analyses,  according  to  the  proposed  specification  and  respective  criteria,  Satisfactory 
information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. The 
finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications through traditional finished 
product release testing. have been presented for three commercial scale batches of the finished product for 
both presentations (i.e. the same batches as used in the stability studies), demonstrating compliance with the 
release specification and showing consistent results.

2.2.3.4.  Stability of the product 
Stability data from three commercial scale batches of each fill volume stored in upright and inverted 
orientations for up to 24 months under long term conditions (5 ± 3°C), and for up to six months under 
accelerated conditions (25 ± 2°C/60 ± 5% RH), according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The stability 
batches are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the proposed container closure 
system. 
Samples have been tested visual appearance, turbidity, pH, osmolality, particulate matter, ammonium ion, 
sulfate ion, particle size distribution, doxorubicin assay and related substances, free doxorubicin, 
encapsulated doxorubicin, drug to lipid ratio, lipids assay and related substances, elemental impurities, 
bacterial endotoxins and sterility.  
The results obtained under long-term conditions comply with specification up until 18 months. 
An in-use study was carried out on three batches of each strength by diluting the vial content in 250 mL bags 
of 5% dextrose injection to a concentration of 0.12 mg/mL (low concentration) or 0.36 mg/mL (high 
concentration) of doxorubicin. The bags were stored for 24 hours at 5 ± 3°C. At initial time and after 24 
hours of storage, the samples were tested for appearance , instrumental colour, turbidity, pH, doxorubicin 
assay, free doxorubicin, and particle size distribution. Subvisible particulate matter was additionally tested for 
the 24-hour samples. The results support the recommendation for the diluted product in SmPC section 6.3. 
A photostability study was carried out on one batch of each strength (20 mg/10 mL; 50 mg/25 mL) of the 
finished according to ICH Q1B. Samples have been tested for appearance, instrument colour, turbidity, pH, 
osmolality, doxorubicin assay and related substances, free doxorubicin, encapsulated doxorubicin, lipid assay 
and related substances, internal and total ammonium ion, internal and total sulfate ion, particle size 
distribution, zeta potential, large-diameter droplet and particulate matter. According to the available results, 
the finished product is susceptible to light. Therefore, the vial is packed in a secondary packaging (such as a 
carton). 
A freeze-thaw cycling study was carried out on one batch of each one of the strengths. Each formulation was 
subjected to one, two, or three cycles, of two storage conditions: freezing temperature (-20 ± 5°C) and 
accelerated storage condition (25°C/ 60% RH). Based on the review of the data obtained there were no 
significant changes in the results during the freeze/thaw study demonstrating that up to three freeze thaw 
cycles are acceptable. Even so, the product is labelled with "avoid freezing " to align with the reference 
medicinal product. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 18 months  and storage conditions “Store in a 
refrigerator (2°C - 8°C)” and “Do not freeze”, as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3 and 6.4) is acceptable. 
2.2.3.5.  Adventitious agents 
A copy of the current CEP for cholesterol is provided, as well as a confirmation that the cholesterol material 
complies with the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform 
Encephalopathy Agents via medicinal products. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and the finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. A CEP issued by EDQM has been submitted for the active

substance. An MO that had been raised about the comparison of the finished product quality attributes versus 
the reference medicinal product has been resolved by provision of additional information and data as 
requested in line with existing guidance. A second MO was raised with regard to the demonstration of 
comparable physical and chemical degradation of test and reference products under stress conditions in 
accordance with the Reflection paper on the data requirements for intravenous liposomal products developed 
with reference to an innovator liposomal product; this MO was resolved by provision of respective 
comparative data as per the above Reflection Paper.  
The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use. 
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there was one minor unresolved quality issue having no impact on the 
benefit-risk balance of the product related to the revalidation of the chromatographic methods. This is 
proposed as a Recommendation for future quality development (see below). 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable and consistent. Physicochemical and biological 
aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled 
in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
- to summarise as appropriate the validity of the conclusions for validation parameters tested based on the 
SST for the next revalidation of the chromatographic methods; it should be stated clearly whether the 
concentrations tested for Linearity were obtained by a serial dilution from a mother solution; it should be 
stated clearly that the accuracy results are obtained testing solutions independent from those used in the 
study of linearity.  
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview of the pharmacological, pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of doxorubicin 
hydrochloride was submitted in which reference was made to available literature data. To obtain a complete 
and current update on the published literature, searches in a variety of databases have been performed (up 
to April 2019) for preclinical pharmacology and toxicology data.  
Additionally, study CEL-LD-102/0CLR2 was submitted by the applicant to characterise, from the nonclinical 
point of view, tissue exposures based on the determination of doxorubicin concentration after administration 
of Celdoxome pegylated liposomal and Caelyx (7.2 mg/kg, IV, each) in six different rat tissues, i.e. skin, 
heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, spleen.

2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Doxorubicin undergoes enzymatic 1- and 2-electron reduction to the corresponding semiquinone and 
dihydroquinone. 7-Deoxyalglycones are formed enzymatically by 1-electron reduction, and the resulting 
semiquinone free radical reacts with oxygen to produce the hydroxyl radical in a cascade of reactions; this 
radical may lead to cell death by reacting with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), ribonucleic acid (RNA), cell 
membranes, and proteins. The dihydroquinone that results from 2-electron reduction of doxorubicin also can 
be formed by reaction of two semiquinones. In the presence of oxygen, dihydroquinone reacts to form 
hydrogen peroxide, and in its absence, loses its sugar and gives rise to the quinone methide, a 
monofunctional alkylating agent with low affinity for DNA. The contribution of dihydroquinone and the 
quinone methide to the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin is unclear. Experimental evidence indicated that 
doxorubicin formed a complex with DNA by intercalation between base pairs, causing inhibition of DNA 
synthesis and DNA-dependent RNA synthesis by the resulting template disordering and steric obstruction. 
Doxorubicin also inhibits protein synthesis. Doxorubicin is also reported to be active through the cell cycle 
including the interphase (Abraham et al, 2005; AHFS, 2015). 
Of the cell types tested in vitro, cardiac cells were the most sensitive to the effects of doxorubicin, followed 
by sarcoma and melanoma cells, normal muscle fibroblasts, and normal skin fibroblasts. Normal, rapidly 
proliferating tissues such as those of bone narrow, gastrointestinal and oral mucosa, and hair follicles are 
also affected to varying degrees. Doxorubicin hydrochloride was also shown to have immunosuppressive 
activity (AHFS, 2015).   
The long circulation and ability of pegylated liposomes to extravasate through ‘leaky’ tumour vasculature 
resulted in localisation of doxorubicin in tumour tissue and reducing cardiotoxicity. In several animal and 
human tumours, including breast, prostate, pancreatic and ovarian xenografts, pegylated liposomal 
doxorubicin produced higher intratumoural drug concentrations and better therapeutic responses than 
equivalent doses of conventional (nonpegylated) liposome encapsulated doxorubicin or free doxorubicin 
(Gabizon et al., 1997). A number of studies have addressed the mechanism of liposome accumulation in 
tumours. It was shown that long circulation was critical for liposome accumulation in tumours, as indicated 
by a correlation between liposome circulation time and tumour uptake. Microscopic observations with 
colloidal gold-labelled liposomes, and morphological studies with fluorescent liposomes in the skin-fold 
chamber model, have shown that liposomes extravasate into the tumour extracellular fluid through gaps in 
tumour microvessels and are found predominantly in the perivascular area with minimal uptake by tumour 
cells. Studies with ascitic tumours showed a steady extravasation process of long circulating liposomes into 
the ascitic fluid with gradual release of drug followed by drug diffusion into the ascitic cellular compartment 
(Gabizon et al, 2003).   
It was hypothesised that circulating liposomes cross the leaky tumour vasculature, moving from plasma 
where drug concentration is relatively high into the interstitial fluid of tumour tissue. This was hypothesised 
to be a slow process, in which long-circulating liposomes possess a distinct advantage because of the 
repeated passage through the tumour microvascular bed. Cellular delivery of drug is thought to depend on 
release from liposomes in the interstitial fluid, since pegylated liposomes are seldom taken up by tumour 
cells. The factors controlling this process and its kinetics are not well understood and may vary among 
tissues. A gradual loss of the liposome gradient retaining doxorubicin and disruption of the integrity of the 
liposome bilayer by phospholipases may be involved in the release process. Uptake by tumour-infiltrating 
macrophages could also contribute to liposomal drug release. In any case, once doxorubicin is released from 
liposomes, it may diffuse freely through the tumour space and reach deep layers of tumour cells, whereas 
Assessment report

most of the liposomes appear to remain in interstitial spaces immediately surrounding the blood vessels 
(Gabizon et al, 2003).  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Comparative pharmacokinetic studies after IV administration of either PLD or conventional doxorubicin to 
rats, rabbits, and dogs have shown increased AUC, decreased Vd, and reduced clearance associated with 
PLD (Table 1). The AUC data best fit a bi-exponential curve, with a short initial t1/2 (1 to 3 hours) followed 
by a longer second t1/2 of 20 to 30 hours, representing the majority (>95%) of the AUC. After 
administration of a single 1.5 mg/kg dose of either PLD or conventional doxorubicin to rabbits, plasma 
doxorubicin levels (and thus plasma AUC) were up to 2,000-fold higher after PLD administration. The plasma 
level of doxorubicin remained very low following administration of PLD, indicating that most of the 
doxorubicin in the plasma remained encapsulated in liposomes. With the observed decreased Vd of PLD 
relative to conventional doxorubicin (Table 1), doxorubicin disposition was shown to be influenced by 
liposomal encapsulation. Plasma doxorubicin concentration and AUC after PLD administration were dose-
dependent, whereas plasma t1/2, Vd, and Cl were independent of PLD dose at the dose levels studied (Vail et 
al., 2004). 
Table 1. Pharmacokinetic parameters of PLD (Doxil) and conventional doxorubicin in rats, rabbits, and dogs 
(Vail et al., 2004) 
Absorption 
In an in vivo study, free doxorubicin or doxorubicin entrapped in cardiolipin liposomes were administered to 
male Sprague-Dawley rats (300-350 g) at a dose of 6 mg/kg over 2 min via the femoral vein in volumes 
corresponding to 1% body weight (0.01 mL/g). Plasma, tissues, bile, and urine were analysed for 
doxorubicin equivalents. The plasma pharmacokinetics of free and liposomal-entrapped doxorubicin in rats at 
the stated concentration is presented in Figure 2. Plasma pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin in rats following a 
dose of 6 mg/kg IV of free doxorubicin or doxorubicin entrapped in liposomes (Rahman et al., 1986) Figure 
2. Following IV administration of free doxorubicin, the peak plasma concentration achieved immediately 
following injection was 1.7 µg/mL. This was reduced to 0.3 µg/mL by 1 h. Free drug cleared from plasma 
very rapidly, with an apparent large volume of distribution. With cardiolipin liposomes, the peak plasma 
concentration of total doxorubicin achieved was 20.9 µg/mL. The total plasma levels of doxorubicin 
Assessment report  
EMA/685994/2022 
Page 22/46 
 
 
 
 
decreased gradually and by 1 h the total doxorubicin concentration in plasma was 10 µg/mL (Rahman et al., 
1986).  
Figure 2. Plasma pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin in rats following a dose of 6 mg/kg IV of free doxorubicin 
or doxorubicin entrapped in liposomes (Rahman et al., 1986) 
The plasma pharmacokinetics of a single dose of Doxil studied in rats and dogs also differed substantially 
from those of free doxorubicin (Table 2). Free doxorubicin was reported to display biphasic curves with a 
rapid decline of the initial plasma concentration. The first phase was a rapid distribution phase with a half-life 
of 5-10 min. The second phase was an elimination and terminal clearance phase with a half-life of 29 h. 
Clearance was in the order of 121 mL/h/kg, and the volume of distribution was very large (~5 L/kg). In 
Doxil treated animals, the plasma concentration of total doxorubicin time profile often also displayed a two-
phase curve but these two phases actually represented two sections of the distribution phase from the 
central compartment. In the initial distribution phase, a minor fraction of the injected dose was cleared from 
circulation with a half-life of about 1 h. During the second extended phase of distribution, accounting for 
most of the AUC, Doxil was cleared with a half-life ranging between 20 and 35 h. The differences in plasma 
concentration between the free drug and the pegylated liposomal formulation were considered substantial 
(Table 2): at least 60-fold increase in AUC for the liposomal drug, with plasma concentrations of doxorubicin 
several 100-fold greater several hours after injection in liposome-treated animals than in animals treated 
with free drug. However, most of the drug (95%) found in plasma remained encapsulated in the liposomes 
and is therefore not yet bioavailable (Gabizon et al., 2003).

levels was presented. BALB/c mice were orthotopically implanted with 4T1 tumour cells, and 10 days after 
implantation, the mice were given IV injections via the lateral tail vein (200 µL) with 9 mg/kg of doxorubicin 
either as free doxorubicin (Doxil) or dioleoylphosphatidylcholine-PLD. To determine if the method scaled with 
dose, some mice received 16 mg/kg doxorubicin from Doxil. Control mice were injected with 200 µL sterile 
saline. Mice (n=3-5 per time point) were euthanised, and tumours were excised at various time points up to 
7 days after injection or until doxorubicin levels were below detectable levels (0.005 microequivalents 
doxorubicin/mL). Total and nuclear (free) doxorubicin in 4T1 tumours were determined via the acidified 
isopropanol extraction method. The concentration of released doxorubicin in tumour tissue was determined 
from the AUC of nuclear drug relative to the AUC of drug in whole tumours over the time course of the 
experiment. Results showed that free doxorubicin had high levels of penetration in tumour tissue; 95% of 
the total doxorubicin in tumours was bound to nuclear DNA by 24 h after injection. Administration of Doxil, a 
slow-release liposomal formulation of doxorubicin, gave an AUC for total doxorubicin 7 days after injection 
that was 87-fold higher than that obtained for free doxorubicin, and 49% of the liposomal doxorubicin was 
released. For liposomes with a more rapid doxorubicin release rate, by 7 days after injection, the AUC0-7 days 
for total doxorubicin was only 14-fold higher than that for free doxorubicin and only 27% of liposomal 
doxorubicin was released (Laginha et al., 2005). 
Distribution 
Doxorubicin administered as a conventional injection is widely distributed in the plasma and tissues. As early 
as 30 seconds after IV administration, doxorubicin is present in liver, lungs, heart, and kidneys. Doxorubicin 
is absorbed by cells and binds to cellular components, particularly to nucleic acids. The volume of distribution 
of doxorubicin hydrochloride administered IV as a conventional injection is about 700-1,100 L/m2. 
Encapsulations in PEG-stabilised liposomes substantially slowed the rate of distribution of doxorubicin into 
the extravascular space. Animal studies indicated that liposome encapsulated doxorubicin distributed from 
blood vessels into tumours, and once distributed into the tissue compartment, the drug was released (AHFS, 
2015).  
In an in vivo study free doxorubicin or doxorubicin entrapped in cardiolipin liposomes were administered to 
male Sprague-Dawley rats (300-350 g) at a dose of 6 mg/kg over 2 min via the femoral vein in volumes 
corresponding to 1% body weight (0.01 mL/g). Pharmacologic disposition of free doxorubicin and 
doxorubicin entrapped in cardiolipin liposomes following IV administration of 6 mg/kg to rats was measured 
(Table 3) (Rahman et al., 1986).

Table 3. Pharmacologic disposition of free doxorubicin and doxorubicin entrapped in cardiolipin liposomes 
following IV administration of 6 mg/kg (Rahman et al., 1986) 
According to results obtained by Gabizon et al. (Table 3), the volume of distribution of Doxil was very small 
and approximated the blood volume in each species, whereas that of free doxorubicin was very large and 
indicative of rapid distribution/dispersion into the tissues. Altogether, Doxil treatment resulted in an 
increased AUC of doxorubicin equivalents and a longer mean residence time, whereas clearance and volume 
of distribution of total drug were significantly decreased compared with free doxorubicin treatment. Studies 
with drug-free liposomes indicated linear, dose-independent pharmacokinetics for pegylated liposomes. 
However, studies with tumour-bearing mice in which the dose of Doxil was escalated from 2.5 to 20 mg/kg 
bodyweight (that is much higher than the maximum recommended human dose) indicated that dose 
escalation resulted in saturation of clearance and a disproportionate increase of plasma concentrations 
(Gabizon et al., 2003). 
•  Study CEL-LD-102/0CLR2 
CEL-LD-102/0CLR2 study was conducted to characterise tissue exposures based on the determination of 
doxorubicin concentration after administration of Celdoxome pegylated liposomal and Caelyx (7.2 mg/kg, IV, 
each) in six different rat tissues, i.e. skin, heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, spleen.   
Material and methods  
Sixty (60) naïve female Sprague-Dawley rats (n=6/time point/compound) were administered a single IV 
bolus injection of Celdoxome pegylated liposomal or Caelyx 2 mg/mL at a dose of 7.2 mg/kg with an 
administration volume of 3.6 mL/kg body weight.

120 h 
After administration, the organs (skin, heart, lungs (left and right), liver, kidneys (left and right), and spleen) 
were collected and concentration of total doxorubicin determined at the following timepoints: 8 h, 24 h, 48 h, 
72 h and 120 h by validated LC/MS/MS method.    
Statistical analysis  
A non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using Phoenix WinNonlin (version 8.1) on 
total doxorubicin concentrations (ng/mL of homogenate) in each tissue (heart, lungs, spleen, liver, kidneys 
and skin). Six (6) different animals were used per time point and per compound, the different areas under 
the concentration-time curve (AUC) were calculated using the linear trapezoidal summation (both ascending 
and descending phase) using the mean tissue concentrations at each time point for each compound: AUC0-last 
and AUC0-120.  
Results  
Following administration of a single intravenous dose of Celdoxome pegylated liposomal, total doxorubicin 
was detected in skin, heart, lung, kidney, spleen and liver tissues from the first sampling time-point (8 h) up 
to the last sampling time point (120 h). The mean maximum (±SEM) concentration of total doxorubicin was 
516±54 ng/mL in skin tissue at 72 h, 579±55 ng/mL in heart tissue at 48 h, 927±58 ng/mL in lung tissue at 
72 h, 744±39 ng/mL in kidney tissue at 72 h, 3123±293 ng/mL in spleen tissue at 24 h and 707±57 ng/mL 
in liver tissue at 24 h. Following administration of Caelyx, very similar concentration-time profiles were 
observed for each tissue. The mean maximum concentration of total doxorubicin was 476±30 ng/mL in skin 
tissue at 48 h, 662±53 ng/mL in heart tissue at 72 h, 911±53 ng/mL in lung tissue at 72 h, 653±34 ng/mL 
in kidney tissue at 72 h, 3337±304 ng/mL in spleen tissue at 24 h, and 817±33 ng/mL in liver tissue at 24 
h.  
However, it was noted that the liver concentration of total doxorubicin peaked higher and dropped faster in 
animals treated with Caelyx than in animals treated with Celerity’s doxorubicin, before reaching similar 
concentrations over the rest of the studied period, i.e. liver concentration of total doxorubicin at 24 h was 
significantly higher in animals treated with Caelyx compared to Celdoxome (817±33 ng/mL vs. 707±57 
ng/mL, p=0.0145) and at 48 h liver concentration of total doxorubicin was significantly lower in animals 
treated with Caelyx compared to Celdoxome (571±22 ng/mL vs. 668±47 ng/mL, p=0.0301). For the rest of 
the studied period administration of both preparations resulted in similar total doxorubicin concentrations in 
the liver, i.e. at 72 h: 470±25 ng/mL vs. 434±27 ng/mL (NS); and at 120 h: 222±17 ng/mL vs. 246±14 
ng/mL (NS).    
Based on the statistical analysis, no difference in skin, heart, lung, kidney, spleen and liver tissue 
concentrations between the two formulations were shown (p-values: 0.5142, 0.9802, 0.8338, 0.8786, 
0.6669, 0.7226, respectively). Additionally, no interaction between formulations and time were reported to 
be observed in all tissues except for liver tissue in which a statistically significant interaction between 
formulations and time (p=0.0239) were noted. However, the ratio of the means for AUC0-last and AUC0-120 
was inside the boundaries of 80-125% for all tested tissues (98.6%, 97.7%, 102.8%, 104.6%, 98.7%, 
98.8%, respectively) and it was stipulated that the 2 formulations led to overall similar tissues exposure. 
Thus, single administrations of 7.2 mg/kg of Celdoxome pegylated liposonal or Caelyx were reported to lead 
to similar exposures (AUC0-last and AUC0-120) in skin, heart, lung, kidney, spleen and liver tissues, with similar 
concentration-time profiles.

Table 4. Pharmacokinetics: Organ Distribution 
In addition to the biodistribution study, results from a bibliographic data search were discussed to further 
understand different aspects of pharmacokinetics. Considering the differences between studies identified and 
CEL-LD-102/0CLR2, including differences in liposomes, doses, weight of rats, study duration (672 hours in 
Burade et al. 2017, 24 hours in Rahman et al. 1986 and 120 hours in the applicant’s study CEL-LD-
102/0CLR2) and between study variability, the tissue exposures seen across the mentioned studies, and 
especially compared for Cmax values, were similar and comparable.  
Metabolism 
Non-encapsulated doxorubicin is metabolised by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-
dependent aldoketoreductases to the hydrophilic 13-hydroxyl metabolite doxorubicinol, which exhibits 
antineoplastic activity and is the major metabolite. These reductases are present in most if not all cells, but 
particularly in erythrocytes, liver, and kidney. Although not clearly established, doxorubicinol also appears to 
be the moiety responsible for the cardiotoxic effects of the drug. Undetectable or low plasma concentrations 
(i.e., 0.826.2 ng/mL) of doxorubicinol have been reported following IV administration of a single 10- to 50 
mg/m2 dose of doxorubicin hydrochloride as a PEG-stabilised liposomal injection. Substantially reduced or 
absent plasma concentrations of the usual major metabolite of doxorubicin observed with the PEG-stabilised 
liposomal injection suggests that either the drug is not released appreciably from the liposomes as they 
circulate or that some doxorubicin may be released but that the rate of doxorubicinol elimination greatly 
exceeds the release rate; doxorubicin hydrochloride encapsulated in liposomes that have not been PEG-
stabilised is metabolised to doxorubicinol. Other metabolites, which are therapeutically inactive, include the 
poorly water-soluble aglycones, doxorubicinone (adriamycinone) and 7-deoxydoxorubicinone (17-
deoxyadriamycinone), and conjugates. The aglycones are formed in microsomes by NADPH-dependent, 
cytochrome reductase-mediated cleavage of the amino sugar moiety. The enzymatic reduction of doxorubicin 
to 7-deoxyaglycones is important to the cytotoxic effect of the drug since it is reported to result in hydroxyl

radicals that cause extensive cell damage and death. With non-encapsulated doxorubicin, more than 20% of 
the total drug in plasma is reported to be present as metabolites as soon as 5 minutes after a dose, 70% in 
30 minutes, 75% in 4 hours, and 90% in 24 h (AHFS, 2015). 
Excretion 
The rate at which liposome encapsulated drug can be cleared from the systemic circulation is reported to be 
affected by three main mechanisms (Gabizon et al., 1997):  
-  Uptake and destruction of circulating liposomes by cells of the RES, with active drug then being 
metabolised and excreted,  
- 
Leakage of drug from liposomes in circulation, followed by rapid and extensive tissue distribution and 
elimination of free drug,  
-  Accumulation of liposome encapsulated drug in non-reticuloendothelial system tissue (including solid 
tumour).  
Plasma clearance of non-encapsulated doxorubicin (when administered as a conventional injection) was 
reported to range from 8-20 mL/minute per kg (or 324-809 mL/min/m2). Plasma clearance of doxorubicin 
encapsulated in PEG-stabilised liposomes appears to be substantially slower than that of non-encapsulated 
doxorubicin, and this results in a substantial increase in the AUC (AHFS, 2015).  
Non-encapsulated doxorubicin and its metabolites are excreted predominantly in bile; about 10-20% of a 
single dose in excreted in feces in 24 h, and 40-50% of a dose is excreted in bile or feces within 7 days. 
About 50% of the drug in bile is unchanged drug, 23% is doxorubicinol, and the remainder is other 
metabolites including aglycones and conjugates, about 4-5% of the administered dose is excreted in urine 
after 5 days, principally as unchanged doxorubicin (AHFS, 2015).   
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Single dose IV injection studies in mice showed the encapsulated form of doxorubicin to be less toxic (LD50 
of 32 mg/kg, being two times the 50 mg/m2 human dose on a mg/m2 basis) than free doxorubicin (LD50 of 
17 mg/kg, being the same as the 50 mg/m2 human dose on a mg/m2 basis). Histologic examination of 
cardiac sections taken from DBA/2J mice 7 days after a single IV injection of free or liposomal doxorubicin 
(25 mg/kg) revealed that the liposomal preparation was much less cardiotoxic. Myelosuppression was seen in 
a study in dogs being less severe after intraperitoneal dosage than after IV dosage of liposomal doxorubicin 
(Caelyx Product Monograph, 2019). 
Cynomolgus monkeys (3/sex) were administered a single IV dose of Caelyx of 10 mg/kg (120 mg/m²; 
approximately two times the clinical dose) and followed for 28 days as a comparator arm in an acute toxicity 
study with an investigational doxorubicin formulation. Three male and one female monkey were sacrificed on 
Day 11 or 15 in poor condition attributable to renal toxicity. Renal toxicity reflected in increased serum 
creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels included tubular and/or glomerular changes and presented as renal 
hemorrhage and/or edema (cortex, pelvis or papilla), distal tubular dilatation, tubular protein casts, 
hypertrophy of the Bowman’s capsular epithelial cells, interstitial neutrophil infiltration, and/or necrosis of 
renal adipose tissue. Renal toxicity has been observed with even lower single doses of doxorubicin HCl in rats 
and rabbits. However, since an evaluation of the postmarketing safety database for Caelyx in patients has 
not suggested a significant nephrotoxicity liability of Caelyx, these findings in monkeys may not have 
relevance to patient risk assessment (Caelyx Product Monograph, 2019).

Repeat-dose toxicity 
A preclinical toxicology study evaluating liposome encapsulated doxorubicin and free doxorubicin carried out 
in beagle dogs was presented. Dogs received single intraperitoneal (IP) infusions of 1.5 mg free or 1.5, 2.25 
or 3.37 mg liposomal doxorubicin/kg. One group of four dogs received 1.5 mg liposomal doxorubicin/kg every 
three weeks for 4 cycles. The dose limiting toxicity of free or liposomal doxorubicin given by the IP route was 
a dose-related chemical peritonitis. This toxicity was more severe in dogs that received by the IP route the 
previously determined maximally tolerated IV dose of liposomal doxorubicin (2.25 mg/kg). The abdominal 
toxicity was characterised by capsular fibrosis and ascites formation. Abdominal toxicity was life-threatening 
after single doses of 3.37 mg liposomal doxorubicin/kg, or after multiple (4) doses of 1.5 mg liposomal 
doxorubicin/kg. Thoracic toxicity (increased fluid, mediastinal oedema, thickening of the parietal pleura) was 
seen after multiple (every 3 weeks for 4 cycles) IP doses of 1.5 mg or single doses of 3.37 mg liposomal 
doxorubicin/kg. Myelosuppression was seen in all groups but was less severe after intraperitoneal dosage 
than after IV dosage of liposomal doxorubicin (Kanter et al., 1994).  
In a rabbit multidose study using well-established histopathological parameters, the cardiac toxicity of Doxil 
was reported to be significantly less compared to doxorubicin (Gabizon et al., 2003).  
The toxicity of Caelyx following repeated administration was reported to be similar in rats and dogs and an 
extension of the findings in the acute studies. Treatment-related effects included dermatologic toxicity, body 
weight and food consumption changes, alopecia, myelotoxicity (bone marrow cellularity changes), and 
haematologic effects (leukopenia and lower erythron mass). Dogs also showed gastrointestinal toxicity but no 
pathologic signs of toxicity (Caelyx Product Monograph, 2019). 
In studies performed after the repeated administration of liposomal doxorubicin to rats and dogs, serious 
dermal inflammations and ulcer formations were observed at clinically relevant doses. In the study in dogs, 
the occurrence and severity of these lesions was reduced by lowering the dose or prolonging the intervals 
between doses. Similar dermal lesions, which are described as palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia were also 
observed in patients after long-term intravenous infusion (Caelyx Summary of Product Characteristics,2021). 
Genotoxicity 
The mutagenicity of doxorubicin has been documented using the Salmonella/microsome mutagenicity assay. 
Doxorubicin has been shown to induce His+ revertants in the Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhimurium) 
strains TA98, TA 1538, TA100, TA2637 and TA102. In several studies, the addition of S9-mix for metabolic 
activation did not modify the mutagenic response of tester strains TA98 and TA1538 to doxorubicin; instead, 
addition of microsomes decreased doxorubicin -induced mutant yields, which were linked to the formation of 
inactive aglycones. This and the fact that doxorubicin binds and intercalates DNA, are said to provide support 
that intercalation processes explain the mechanism of mutagenicity of doxorubicin (Kostoryz, 2001).  
Doxorubicin has a high affinity for inorganic iron, Fe(III), and has potential to form doxorubicin-Fe(III) 
complexes in biological systems. Indirect involvement of iron has been substantiated in the oxidative 
mutagenicity of doxorubicin. However, direct involvement of Fe(III) was evaluated in mutagenicity studies 
with the doxorubicin-Fe(III) complex. The Salmonella mutagenicity assay with strain TA102 was used with a 
pre-incubation step. The highest mutagenicity of doxorubicin-Fe(III) complex was reported to be observed at 
the dose of 2.5 nmol/plate of the complex. The S9-mix decreased this highest mutagenicity but increased the 
number of revertants at a higher dose of 10 nmol/plate of the complex. On the other hand, the mutagenicity 
of the doxorubicin-Fe(III) complex at the doses of 0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2 nmol/plate was said to be enhanced 
about twice by the addition of glutathione plus H2O2. This enhanced mutagenicity as well as of the complex 
Assessment report

itself, the complex plus glutathione, and the complex plus H2O2 were reduced by the addition of ADR-529, an 
Fe(III) chelator, and potassium iodide, a hydroxyl radical scavenger. These results indicate, according to the 
authors, that doxorubicin-Fe(III) complex exert the mutagenicity through oxidative DNA damage and that 
Fe(III) is a required element in the mutagenesis of doxorubicin (Kostoryz, 2001).  
Four studies were carried out with STEALTH placebo liposome to confirm their lack of mutagenicity and 
genotoxicity. Negative results were obtained in the Ames, the L5178Y mouse lymphoma, and chromosomal 
aberration assays in vitro, and the mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay in vivo (AHFS, 2015; Caelyx 
Product Monograph, 2019). 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
Doxorubicin was shown to be embryotoxic and teratogenic in rats and embryotoxic and abortifacient in 
rabbits, and trace amounts of drug have been found in mouse foetuses and in one aborted human foetus 
following administration of conventional doxorubicin. Liposomal doxorubicin was embryotoxic at doses of 1 
mg/kg daily (corresponding to 6 mg/m2 being 6 the correction factor (Km) for rats; about 1/8 of the 50 
mg/m2 human dose) in rats and is embryotoxic and abortifacient at doses of 0.5 mg/kg daily (corresponding 
to 6 mg/m2 being 12 the Km for rabbits; about 1/8 of the 50 mg/m2 human dose) in rabbits. Embryotoxicity 
consisted of increased embryofoetal deaths and reduced live litter sizes (Caelyx Product Monograph, 2019). 
The potential developmental toxicity of Caelyx was evaluated in rats and rabbits. In the first study, IV bolus 
injections of Caelyx 0.1, 0.5, or 1.0 mg/kg were administered on gestation days 6, 9, 12, and 15; or 
STEALTH placebo liposomes or saline on the same treatment schedule. An additional group received 
doxorubicin 0.2 or 0.4 mg/kg daily between gestation days 6 and 15. Equivalent maternal toxicity occurred in 
the Caelyx 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg groups and in the doxorubicin groups. Caelyx 1.0 mg/kg induced decreased 
fetal weights, increases in fetal resorptions, and retarded ossification of caudal vertebrae and xiphoid canters 
in the fetuses. No adverse effects were seen in dams or fetuses in the placebo liposome or Caelyx 0.1 mg/kg 
groups (Caelyx Product Monograph, 2019).  
The embryotoxicity of Caelyx was confirmed in the study in pregnant New Zealand White rabbits 
administered intravenous injections of Caelyx 0.5, 1.5, or 2.5 mg/kg on gestation days 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18. 
All doses were maternally toxic. Four females that died (3 and 1 in the high- and mid-dose groups, 
respectively), surviving females in the mid- and high-dose groups (4 and 2, respectively), and 4 females 
(low-dose group) who aborted prior to the end of the study all had 100% resorbed conceptuses. The uterine 
of another female (low-dose group) who aborted prior to the end of the study consisted of 3 normal 
conceptuses, 4 late resorptions, and 5 early resorptions. Caelyx is both embryotoxic and an abortifacient in 
rabbits (Caelyx Product Monograph, 2019).  
Liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride has been associated with mild to moderate ovarian and testicular 
atrophy in mice after a single 36 mg/kg dose (corresponding to 98 mg/m2 being 3 times the Km for mice; 
about two times the 50 mg/m2 human dose), decreased testicular weight and hypospermia in rats after 
repeated dosages of 0.25 mg/kg or more daily (corresponding to 1.5 mg/m2 being 6 the Km for rats; about 
1/30 of the 50 mg/m2 human dose), and diffuse degeneration of the seminiferous tubules and marked 
decreases in spermatogenesis in dogs after repeated dosages of 1 mg/kg daily (corresponding to 20 mg/m2 
being 20 the Km for rabbits; about 1/2 of the 50 mg/m2 human dose) (AHFS, 2015).

Local tolerance 
A study in rabbits showed liposomal doxorubicin was well tolerated with no gross or microscopic evidence of 
irritation at injection site. In contrast, histopathological evaluation of the subcutaneous injection sites showed 
reversible mild to moderate dose-related inflammation and necrosis (Caelyx Product Monograph, 2019). In 
animal experiments, the injection of granulocyte–macrophage colonystimulating factor (GM-CSF) 6 µg at the 
injection site of doxorubicin had a beneficial effect on the doxorubicin-induced tissue necrosis (Schrijvers, 
2003). 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
A justification for not providing ERA studies was provided (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). The 
introduction of Celdoxome pegylated liposomal is considered unlikely to result in any significant increase in 
the combined sales volumes for all doxorubicin hydrochloride containing products and the exposure of the 
environment to the active substance.  
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pegylated liposomes cause doxorubicin to be slowly released into tissues over several days. Thus, the 
proportion of doxorubicin that is available at the tumour site at any one time is thought to be several times 
higher than it is in normal tissues. Long-circulating pegylated liposomal formulations of doxorubicin have 
been shown to result in increased accumulation of drug in solid tumours and reduced dose-limiting toxicities. 
Comparative pharmacokinetic studies after IV administration of either PLD or conventional doxorubicin to 
rats, rabbits, and dogs have confirmed increased AUC, decreased distribution volume, and reduced clearance 
of total drug associated with PLD. Doxorubicin is metabolised by NADPH-dependent aldoketoreductases to the 
hydrophilic 13-hydroxyl metabolite doxorubicinol, which exhibits antineoplastic activity and is the major 
metabolite. These reductases are present in most if not all cells, but particularly in erythrocytes, liver, and 
kidney. Doxorubicin and its metabolites are excreted predominantly in bile.  
Results from a biodistribution study (CEL-LD-102/0CLR2) in which the level of test formulation was quantified 
in level in skin, heart, lungs, liver, kidneys and spleen, were presented. The distribution equivalence criteria 
for each tissue was based on AUC which represents the overall exposure to the tissue. Similar exposures 
were obtained for both liposomal formulations in skin, heart, lung, kidney, and spleen, with comparable 
concentration-time profiles, but significant differences were found in the liver concentrations at 24 h and 48 h 
time points. Although the Test/Reference Cmax ratios for each tissue were not part of the analysis plan and 
the study was not powered to demonstrate equivalence on Cmax, the Cmax T/R ratio in liver was 86.5% and 
falls between the BE boundaries of 80-125%, which is considered acceptable. 
During the procedure, the applicant conducted a bibliographic data search, and the results were discussed in 
conjunction with the biodistribution study. The distribution results from the applicant’s study are in line with 
those previously reported for liposomal doxorubicin and Caelyx. The conclusion supports the equivalence 
between test and reference formulations regarding biodistribution.  
The toxicity profile of capsuled and free doxorubicin HCl has been well characterised based on available 
literature data on conventional liposomes and free drug as well as on studies performed specifically on 
Caelyx or Doxil. Single dose IV injection studies in mice showed the encapsulated form of doxorubicin to be 
less toxic than free doxorubicin. Histologic examination of cardiac sections after a single IV injection of free 
or liposomal doxorubicin revealed that the liposomal preparation was much less cardiotoxic.

Myelosuppression was seen in a study in dogs being less severe after intraperitoneal dosage than after IV 
dosage of liposomal doxorubicin.  
Doxorubicin has been shown to be carcinogenic in experimental models (AHFS, 2015). 
Liposomal doxorubicin was shown to be embryotoxic in rats and embryotoxic and abortifacient in rabbits. 
Liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride has been associated with mild to moderate ovarian and testicular 
atrophy in mice after a single dose, decreased testicular weight and hypospermia in rats, and diffuse 
degeneration of the seminiferous tubules and marked decreases in spermatogenesis in dogs, after repeated 
dosages.  
Histopathological evaluation of the IV injection sites revealed that Caelyx, doxorubicin hydrochloride, and 
placebo liposomes were well tolerated with no gross or microscopic evidence of irritation (Caelyx Product 
monograph, 2019). 
The applicant has not presented new genotoxicity studies on Celdoxome pegylated liposomal. The 
mutagenicity of doxorubicin has been well documented using the Salmonella/microsome mutagenicity assay. 
Studies for qualification of impurities were presented, during the procedure. Although Doxorubicin Dimer 
Impurity 1, was predicted to be plausible for in vitro mutagenicity by Derek and positive by LSMA, it is 
agreed that API, which is a cancer therapeutic, and is not expected or predicted to be more toxic than the 
API, formation of this impurity in the drug product will not increase the concentration of this specific chemical 
class. This impurity is considered qualified at the proposed qualification limit of 1.2%, which is considered 
acceptable. 
Environmental Risk Assessment 
Doxorubicin is already used in existing marketed products and no significant increase in environmental 
exposure is anticipated. This medicinal product should be used according to the precautions stated in the 
SmPC (section 6.6) in order to minimise any potential risks to the environment. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical studies and literature review provided are considered adequate to support a hybrid 
application. The presented data indicated comparability of biodistribution, pharmacokinetics and toxicological 
properties of Celdoxome pegylated liposomal and Caelyx. 
The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product.

Study 0927-17: “A Multicenter, Open label, Randomized, Two-treatment, Two-period, Two-sequence, Single 
dose, Crossover Study to Test for Bioequivalence between Celerity’s Doxorubicin hydrochloride (Pegylated 
Liposomal) Injection 20 mg/10 mL (2 mg/mL) and the Reference Product Caelyx [Doxorubicin hydrochloride 
(Pegylated Liposomal) Injection 20 mg/10 mL (2 mg/mL)] in patients with Metastatic Breast cancer”.  
Study design 
The study consisted of a 14-day screening period prior to Day 1 and treatment phase with 50 mg/m2 dose 
[based on body surface area (BSA)] of doxorubicin hydrochloride in each study period. As the recommended 
dosage interval of doxorubicin hydrochloride is every 4 weeks, two consecutive treatment cycles were used 
for the two treatment periods. The washout period was therefore 28 days (dosing days were specifically Day 
1 and Day 29 per protocol - with allowed windows when needed). Following a screening visit, there were 18 
other visits (a total of 19 visits) during the study. The total duration of the study for an individual patient was 
approximately 71 days (including the screening phase).  
Drug products were to be administered as intravenous infusion via infusion pump over 60 minutes (± 5 
minutes) period. Drug products were administered as intravenous infusion via infusion pump over 60 minutes 
(± 5 minutes) period. After a supervised overnight fasting of at least 8 hours, patients were served a non-
high fat breakfast, which they have consumed completely within 30 minutes. The breakfast derived 
approximately 15-20%, 60-65%, and 20-25% calories from protein, carbohydrate, and fat respectively. The 
IMP was administered at two hours (± 10 minutes) after serving of breakfast. 
The dose of doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection for individual subject was period specific and was 
calculated according to body surface area using appropriate formula (Du Bois method):

Pre-medication with dexamethasone and granisetron was used for all subjects. Prophylactic anti-allergy 
treatment and Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) were permitted at the discretion of the 
investigator until 2 hours prior or after study drug administration. Chronic medication was permitted also 
until 2 hours prior or after study drug administration Prophylactic or chronic medications were accepted for 
ethical reasons and considering the target population, although evaluated for any potential PK interactions 
with the test product impacting efficacy and safety. Patients receiving non-permissible concomitant 
medications were documented as protocol deviations and the PK data excluded and considered for the 
bioequivalence assessment.    
For doxorubicin, 27 blood samples were to be drawn into blood collection tubes (5 mL each) containing pre-
cooled k3EDTA as anticoagulant. Samples were withdrawn at pre-dose (within 5 min prior to dosing) and post 
dose at 0.333, 0.667, 1.00, 1.08, 1.25, 1.50, 1.75, 2.00, 2.50, 3.00, 4.00, 5.00, 6.00, 8.00, 12.00, 16.00, 
24.00, 36.00, 48.00, 72.00, 120.00, 168.00, 216.00, 264.00, 312.00 and 360.00 hours. Blood samples 
collected at 01.00 h and 1.08 h were carried out immediately before and immediately after the completion of 
infusion, respectively. Blood samples at 72.00, 120.00, 168.00, 216.00, 264.00, 312.00 and 360.00 hours 
blood draw were collected as ambulatory blood draw. Adverse events and vital signs have been monitored at 
the specified time-points during the study. 
The plasma samples of patients were analysed using three separate validated liquid chromatography-tandem 
mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS) methods for doxorubicinol (single method), encapsulated doxorubicin and 
total doxorubicin (single method) and free doxorubicin (single method).

Population(s) studied 
Sixty-eight (68) female patients with confirmed metastatic breast cancer (TxNxM1 (any T, any N M1) stage 
based on TNM Classification of Malignant Tumours), who were scheduled to start therapy with doxorubicin 
hydrochloride (pegylated liposomal) injection, 20 mg/10 mL (2 mg/mL) were considered eligible and were 
initially included in this study after meeting the criteria of inclusion/exclusion described on study 
protocol/final report. Fifty-nine patients (aged 32 to 71 years) completed the two study periods.  
A total of 8 patients discontinued/ were withdrawn after dosing of Period I and one patient was withdrawn 
after dosing of Period II. 
From the 59 subjects that have concluded both study periods, 2 subjects were excluded from bioequivalence 
statistical analysis due pre-dose concentrations above 5% of subject’s respective Cmax and one subject was 
excluded from PK and statistical analysis due to non-reportable concentration values before actual tmax. 
Exclusion of these subjects from PK and statistical analysis is in agreement with the Guideline 
CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev1 and study Protocol. 
A total of 100 patients were screened and, of these, 68 received at least one dose of the study medication. A 
list of screen failures and motives was provided. Overall 59 (87%) patients completed the treatment for the 
two treatment periods. 
Demographics and baseline characteristics for the safety population are presented in the following table:

Table 6. Demographics and baseline characteristics (Safety set) 
Analytical methods 
A liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method has been developed and validated 
for the determination of free doxorubicin and encapsulated doxorubicin in human plasma. Unencapsulated 
drug concentrations were therefore achieved by means of appropriate bioanalytical methods rather than by 
subtracting encapsulated from total drug, in accordance with the product-specific bioequivalence Guidance. 
Pharmacokinetic variables 
The following pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated: 
Primary pharmacokinetic parameters 
Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ for unencapsulated and encapsulated doxorubicin. 
Secondary pharmacokinetic parameters 
Tmax, AUC0-48, AUC48-t, λz, t½, AUC_%Extrap_obs, Cl and Vd for unencapsulated and encapsulated doxorubicin. 
Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were calculated by non-compartmental methods for free doxorubicin 
(uncapsulated) and liposome encapsulated doxorubicin, using Phoenix WinNonlin v 6.4. PK parameters AUC0-
t, AUC0-48h, AUC0-∞ were calculated by the linear trapezoidal method. Cmax and tmax were based on the actual 
data. The apparent first-order terminal elimination constant (ke) was calculated from the semi-log plot of the 
plasma concentration versus time curve for each analyte. The parameter was calculated by linear least-
Assessment report  
EMA/685994/2022 
Page 36/46 
 
 
 
 
squares regression analysis using the maximum number of points in the terminal log-linear phase (three at 
least or more non-zero plasma concentrations). Parameter AUC0-inf was calculated as the sum of AUC0-t plus 
the ratio of the last measurable plasma concentration to the ke. The elimination t1/2 was calculated as (ln 
2)/ke.  
Actual sampling time points were used for the calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters.  
Statistical methods 
For sample size, calculations were based on CRO data. An intra-subject C.V. of 35% for the bioequivalence 
metrics of free doxorubicin, and an expected Test to Reference ratio of geometric LS means within 95% and 
105% were assumed.  
Continuous variables were summarised with the following descriptive statistics: n (number of observations), 
arithmetic mean, geometric mean, standard deviation (SD), coefficient of variation (CV%), minimum, median 
and maximum. Categorical data are summarised with frequencies and percentages. 
Demographic parameters were summarised descriptively. Treatment-emergent adverse events were 
summarised descriptively by treatment for all subjects who were dosed (Safety population).  
For the required analytes, individual (per subject) and mean plasma concentration versus time curves were 
presented for both linear and semi-log scales. Descriptive statistics (arithmetic mean, SD, CV%, minimum, 
median and maximum value) of the plasma concentrations were presented for each timepoint. 
Cmax, AUC0-t AUC0-inf for free (uncapsulated) and liposomal (encapsulated) doxorubicin, as well as partial AUCs 
(AUC0-48h and AUC48-tlast) for encapsulated doxorubicin, were the primary pharmacokinetic parameters for 
bioequivalence evaluation. The other PK parameters were considered for information purposes only. The 
analysis of bioequivalence was conducted in the pharmacokinetic analysis population. Statistical calculations 
were performed by SAS v.9.4 software. 
Using a general linear model, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed on the primary 
pharmacokinetic parameters. The terms included in the ANOVA model were Centre, Sequence, Sequence by 
Centre, Subject nested within Sequence by Centre, Period and Formulation. These terms were used as fixed 
effects and were assessed at the 5% two-sided level. As an exploratory analysis, the MAA performed a new 
ANOVA with terms Centre, Sequence, Sequence by Centre, Patient (Sequence by Centre), Formulation, 
Period (Centre) and Formulation by Centre interaction.  
For the pairwise comparisons of interest, the 90% confidence intervals for the ratios of the treatment means 
(Test/Reference) were calculated. Bioequivalence between Test and Reference products was declared when 
the 90% confidence interval of the ratio of the means (Test/Reference) for the primary pharmacokinetic 
parameters was within 80.00-125.00% range. 
Results 
Sixty-eight (68) female patients were included in this study and dosed in period I. From these, fifty-nine (59) 
patients completed both treatment periods. Each subject received a single dose of doxorubicin hydrochloride 
liposome concentrate for dispersion for infusion (2 mg/mL) at a dose of 50mg/m2, obtained from 20 mg/10 
mL vials of both Test and Reference products, according to the randomisation scheme. Based on pre-specified 
analysis rules, 58 patients were included the PK and statistical analysis for encapsulated doxorubicin while 
fifty-six were included in the PK and statistical analysis for unencapsulated doxorubicin.

For the majority of subjects, dosing differences were between [-0.5 to 0.5 mg], with 24 subjects presenting 
no dosing differences between the two periods. 
Clinical phase of the study was initiated on 27th August 2018 and was completed on 27th May 2019. 
Major protocol deviations were visit schedule related and safety reporting.

•  Safety data 
The 68 patients in the bioequivalence study Study 0927-17 were included in safety evaluation. Patients were 
administered doxorubicin hydrochloride injection 2 mg/mL (50 mg/m2 dose) by IV infusion after dilution over 
1 hour (+ 5 minutes window period). The washout between administration of Period-I and Period-II was 28 
days, with a window period of + 14 days for adverse event management. A total of 63 subjects received one 
dose of Doxorubicin Celdoxome and 65 subjects received one dose of Caelyx. 
The MAA assessment of causality was “Related” (Certain, Probable /Likely and Possible) and “not related” 
(Unlikely).  
68 patients were dosed in the study (98.53%). According to severity (per CTCAE), out of the 454 AEs, 276 
were mild, 144 moderate, 30 severe, 1 life-threatening and 3 not classified. The CSR refers data by Test 
Product-T and Reference Product-R. 
Test Product: 
214 AEs were reported by 88.89% (n=56) of the 63 patients; 124 were mild, 73 moderate, 16 severe, and 1 
life-threatening. 112 were considered related to test product and 102 unrelated. 117 were “recovered without 
sequelae”, 59 “not yet recovered”, 19 “change in severity”, 18 “stable” and 1 “converted to SAE”. 
Reference Product: 
240 AEs were reported by 90.77% (n=59) of 65 patients; 152 were mild, 71 moderate, 14 severe, and 3 not 
classified (Thrombocytosis, Leukocytosis and Neutrophil count increased). 114 were related to test product 
and 126 unrelated. 118 were “recovered without sequelae”, 84 “not yet recovered”, 17 “change in severity”, 
18 “stable”, 2 “converted to SAE” and 1 “recovered with sequelae”. 
143 of the AEs were still ongoing at the end of the study, the majority related to laboratory abnormalities. 
Out of 454 AEs, 15 AEs were infusion related reactions. These infusion related AEs occurred in 8 patients, out 
of which 2 received test product and were withdrawn (due to chest pain, uneasiness in chest and flushing of 
face in 1; giddiness, palpitation, and headache in another). Other 4 infusion related reactions occurred with 
test product, and 2 with reference product; all were resolved with stopping the infusion.  
Assessment report  
EMA/685994/2022 
Page 40/46 
 
 
 
 
 
A total of 4 SAEs were reported in the study. Out of 4 SAEs, 2 SAEs (Suspected Neutropenia, Oral 
candidiasis) occurred after administration of the test treatment and 2 SAEs (disease progression, anaemia) 
occurred after administration of the reference treatment. The causality assessment was judged as related for 
3 SAEs (2 SAEs in test treatment and 1 SAE in reference treatment) and as unrelated for 1 SAE (reference 
treatment). 
No immunological events were reported.  
A total of 8 patients discontinued/ were withdrawn after dosing of Period-I and 1 patient was withdrawn after 
dosing of Period-II. 
Four (4) patients discontinued treatment due to AEs, out of two patients (2) in the test group and two 
patients (2) in the reference group; however, the two (2) patients in test group discontinued due to infusion 
related reactions, and in the reference group no relation to reference drug seems possible.  
2.4.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application.  
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
In support of this application for this hybrid application with reference to Adriamycin, the applicant provided 
the results of a bioequivalence study and a review of scientific literature on the clinical pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics of doxorubicin.  
Due to the difference in formulation between Celdoxome pegylated liposomal and Adriamycin, the pivotal 
clinical study is a bioequivalence study to establish essential similarity between Celdoxome pegylated 
liposomal and the reference product Caelyx 2 mg/mL concentrate for solution for infusion.  
The applicant stated that the trial was conducted in compliance with GCP and GLP requirements.   
Concerns raised regarding the quality system of the CRO based on previous GCP inspections, and its extent 
and relevance in the current application, triggered a GCP inspection. It was considered that all data collected 
in the trial was considered acceptable to support the marketing authorisation of the product Celdoxome 
pegylated liposomal. 
The presented study was designed as an open-label, two-period, two-way, crossover study in female patients 
with metastatic breast cancer and who were scheduled to start therapy with doxorubicin hydrochloride 
(pegylated liposomal) injection (i.e., the study medications were to be administered in a random fashion on 
the first day of Cycles 1 and 2). 
The test and reference products and the mode of administration are in accordance with Pegylated liposomal 
doxorubicin hydrochloride concentrate for solution 2 mg/ml product-specific bioequivalence guidance. 
Further, the dosing interval is in line with the recommended posology of one dose once every 4 weeks, as 
this BE study is conducted in breast cancer patients. 
The sample size calculations were based on available CRO’s data and are consistent with standard 
methodology. It was estimated that the number of subjects to meet the 80 to 125% bioequivalence range 
with an alfa error of 0.05 was 76, with a statistical a priori power of at least 92%. With 68 subjects included 
in the trial, an a priori power of at least 89% was reached (calculations performed by PK assessor).

EMA/685994/2022 
Page 41/46 
 
 
 
The concentrations of unencapsulated doxorubicin (non-liposomal, free) and encapsulated doxorubicin in 
human plasma were determined using two separate LC-MS/MS methods. Both methods met the acceptance 
criteria for all the validation parameters evaluated, demonstrating acceptable performance.  
Statistical methodology used in the study was conducted in line with the Guideline on the investigation of 
bioequivalence and is considered appropriate.  
Regarding the bioequivalence investigation, the submitted study showed bioequivalence for the required 
metrics for free form and encapsulated form of doxorubicin, as required in the product specific guidance 
(EMA/CHMP/800775/2017). Celdoxome pegylated liposomal 2 mg/mL concentrate for dispersion for infusion 
and the Reference product Caelyx 2 mg/mL (doxorubicin concentrate for solution for infusion; Janssen-Cilag 
International N.V.), are considered bioequivalent.  
The application in the claimed indications was also supported by literature data on pegylated liposomal 
doxorubicin (PLD) in patients with metastatic breast cancer, recurrent ovarian cancer, multiple myeloma and 
AIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma, which is acceptable for a “hybrid” application. 
Clinical safety 
From the 68 female patients with metastatic breast cancer randomised to the single pivotal BE study CEL-LD-
202/0927-17, a total of 63 subjects received one dose of Doxorubicin Celdoxome and 65 subjects received 
one dose of Caelyx. Therefore, most of the patients were exposed to two doses of liposomal doxorubicin 
50mg/m2 28 days apart, with a limited follow up. 
The baseline clinical characteristics per group showed a numerical imbalance in ECOG (ECOG 1 in 68.75% of 
patients in test product vs 83.33% in reference product), and in radiotherapy (no radiotherapy in 40.63% of 
test product and 58.33% in the reference product). No differences in cancer staging and past chemotherapy 
were observed. Overall, the demographics and baseline characteristics seem to have no influence in the 
results. 
The incidence and pattern of adverse events per severity and per system organ class were in line with the 
known safety profile of the medicinal products and the medical condition of the study subjects. There were no 
unexpected events and there were no significant differences between the AEs for subjects exposed to the test 
product vs. reference product. 
The most common AEs by preferred term were Anaemia, Leukopenia and Neutropenia. Most of the AEs were 
mild or moderate. The number of SAEs was low, as expected from the known safety profile of liposomal 
pegylated doxorubicin. There were four (4) SAEs reported during the study, out of which, two (2) SAE were 
related to test drug and one (1) to reference drug. No deaths had occurred during the study. 
The imbalance in the discontinuation cases was also discussed, and the applicant reinforced that the 
discontinuation was not related to allergy or anaphylactoid reactions. 
There were eight patients with infusion related reactions, but not mentioned as immunological events. There 
seems to be an imbalance in the frequency of infusion reactions: only 2 infusion reactions with reference 
product, and 6 with the test product (2 withdrawn). The applicant justified that the majority of infusion 
related reactions were in the first minutes of the infusion, were mild-to-moderate in severity and considered 
to be allergic-like.  
No differences in AEs related to abnormal laboratory values could be observed.

No  data  was  provided  pertaining  to  Safety  related  to  drug-drug  interactions  and  other  interactions.  This  is 
acceptable as the subjects were exposed to the investigational product as a monotherapy.  
Overall, it seems there were no major differences in AEs in the Doxorubicin Celdoxome group as compared to 
Caelyx. Although the numbers are very scarce, and a definitive statistical conclusion is not possible based on 
the available data, a possible imbalance in infusion related reactions for test product was discussed. 
The naming of liposomal formulations has been recognised as a major safety issue; since the liposomal and 
non-liposomal formulations of the same active substance may have different biodistribution and release 
properties, medication errors can pose serious risks to the health of patients. In line with requirements for 
naming of liposomal formulations, the qualifier “Pegylated Liposomal” has been included after the invented 
name and before the strength in the pharmaceutical form.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
In  conclusion,  based  on  the  submitted  documentation  Celdoxome  pegylated  liposomal  is  considered 
bioequivalent to Caelyx.  
The  safety  data  from  the  bioequivalence  trial  was  consistent  with  the  known  safety  profile  of  the  reference 
product doxorubicin hydrochloride and the comparator liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
This centralised procedure concerns a hybrid application for Celdoxome pegylated liposomal 2 mg/ml 
concentrate for dispersion for infusion with the reference medicinal product Adriamycin 2 mg/ml solution for 
injection (non-pegylated liposomal formulation). However, since Caelyx contains doxorubicin hydrochloride in 
a pegylated liposomal formulation, it was considered an appropriate comparator for the purpose of 
bioequivalence. 
The proposed indications for doxorubicin hydrochloride Celdoxome (a pegylated liposomal formulation) are 
the same as those authorised for Caelyx: 
Celdoxome pegylated liposomal is indicated in adults: 
-  As monotherapy for patients with metastatic breast cancer, where there is an increased cardiac risk. 
- 
- 
- 
For treatment of advanced ovarian cancer in women who have failed a first-line platinum based 
chemotherapy regimen. 
In combination with bortezomib for the treatment of progressive multiple myeloma in patients who 
have received at least one prior therapy and who have already undergone or are unsuitable for bone 
marrow transplant. 
For treatment of AIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) in patients with low CD4 counts (< 200 CD4 
lymphocytes/mm3) and extensive mucocutaneous or visceral disease. 
Celdoxome pegylated liposomal may be used as first-line systemic chemotherapy, or as second line 
chemotherapy in AIDS-KS patients with disease that has progressed with, or in patients intolerant to, prior 
combination systemic chemotherapy comprising at least two of the following agents: a vinca alkaloid, 
bleomycin and standard doxorubicin (or other anthracycline). 
This application is based on a single pivotal clinical bioequivalence study to establish essential similarity 
between Celdoxome pegylated liposomal and the Caelyx 2 mg/mL concentrate for solution for infusion. The 
presented study was designed as an open-label, two-period, two-way, crossover study in female patients 
with metastatic breast cancer and who were scheduled to start therapy with doxorubicin hydrochloride 
(pegylated liposomal) injection (i.e., the study medications were to be administered in a random fashion on 
the first day of Cycles 1 and 2). The provided comparative bioavailability study is appropriate and also in 
accordance with the product-specific bioequivalence guidance. Statistical methodology used in the study is 
considered appropriate.

The submitted study showed bioequivalence for the required metrics for free form and encapsulated form of 
doxorubicin. Test product Celdoxome pegylated liposomal and the Reference product Caelyx 2 mg/mL 
(doxorubicin concentrate for solution for infusion; Janssen-Cilag International N.V.) are considered 
bioequivalent.  
A review of bibliographic data was also provided and supports the claimed indications. 
The safety data from the bioequivalence trial is consistent with the known safety profile of the reference 
product doxorubicin hydrochloride and the comparator liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride. 
A benefit/risk balance comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
3.1.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Celdoxome pegylated liposomal is positive, subject to the conditions stated 
in section ‘Recommendations’. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Celdoxome is not similar to Zejula, Abecma, Blenrep, Darzalex, 
Farydak, Imnovid, Kyprolis, and Ninlaro within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000.  
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Celdoxome pegylated liposomal is favourable in the following indication(s): 
Celdoxome pegylated liposomal is indicated in adults: 
-  As monotherapy for patients with metastatic breast cancer, where there is an increased cardiac risk. 
- 
- 
- 
For treatment of advanced ovarian cancer in women who have failed a first-line platinum based 
chemotherapy regimen. 
In combination with bortezomib for the treatment of progressive multiple myeloma in patients who 
have received at least one prior therapy and who have already undergone or are unsuitable for bone 
marrow transplant. 
For treatment of AIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) in patients with low CD4 counts (< 200 CD4 
lymphocytes/mm3) and extensive mucocutaneous or visceral disease. 
Celdoxome pegylated liposomal may be used as first-line systemic chemotherapy, or as second line 
chemotherapy in AIDS-KS patients with disease that has progressed with, or in patients intolerant to, prior

TEDIZOLID PHOSPHATE
PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN BY PRODUCT
Summary of risk management plan for tedizolid phosphate  
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for tedizolid phosphate. The RMP 
details important risks of tedizolid phosphate, how these risks can be minimised, and how 
more information will be obtained about tedizolid phosphate’s risks and uncertainties 
(missing information).
The Summary of product characteristics (SmPC) for Sivextro and its package leaflet give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how tedizolid phosphate 
should be used. 
I.
The Medicine and What it is Used For
Sivextro 200 mg film-coated tablet is authorised for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and 
soft structure infections (ABSSSI) in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older (see 
SmPC for the full indication). It contains tedizolid phosphate as the active substance and it is 
given by oral administration once daily for 6 days.
Sivextro 200 mg powder for concentration for solution for infusion is authorised for the 
treatment of acute bacterial skin and soft structure infections (ABSSSI) in adults and 
adolescents 12 years of age and older (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains tedizolid 
phosphate as the active substance and it is given by intravenous infusion over 60 minutes 
once daily for 6 days.
Further information about the evaluation of the benefits of Sivextro can be found in the 
EPAR for Sivextro, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, 
under the medicine’s webpage [link to product’s EPAR summary landing page on the EMA 
webpage https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/sivextro]
II.
Risks Associated With the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further 
Characterise the Risks 
Important risks of Sivextro, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about the risks of Sivextro, are outlined below.
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
 Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;

Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
 The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so as to 
ensure that the medicine is used correctly;

 The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with 
or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analysed including PSUR assessment - so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Sivextro is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below.
II.A
List of Important Risks and Missing Information
Important risks of Sivextro are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient evidence of a link with the use of Sivextro. Potential risks are 
concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available 
data, but this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing 
information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently 
missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

6 days have not been established. The risks associated with prolonged 
treatment are addressed in the SmPC Sections 4.2 and 4.4.

Introduction 
Moroctocog alfa (AF-CC), marketed under the trade names Xyntha in the United States and ReFacto AF 
in  Europe,  is  a  recombinant  factor  VIII  (FVIII)  product  for  use  in  the  treatment  of  subjects  with 
hemophilia A (congenital FVIII deficiency).  It is produced using a modification of the previous process 
used  for  manufacture  of  its  predecessor  product  (ReFacto)  that  eliminates  the  addition  of  all  human- 
and animal-derived proteins.   
The MAH has in accordance with article 46 of the paediatric regulation 1901/2006 submitted the study 
3082B2-4418 (B1831003). 
For  the  purpose  of  post-authorization  safety  surveillance,  this  study  monitored  development  of 
clinically  relevant  and  laboratory-confirmed  inhibitors  in  a  population  of  subjects  with  hemophilia A, 
who after consultation with their physician, chose to be treated with Xyntha independent of this study.  
The study was discontinued because the Sponsor has ongoing studies collecting similar safety data. 
Study 3082B2-4418 (B1831003) 
This was a nonrandomized, single treatment and prospective open-label study to evaluate the overall 
safety of Xyntha in subjects transitioning from ReFacto or other FVIII replacement products to Xyntha 
in  usual  care  settings.    Although  the  original  protocol  was  designed  to  include  only  subjects 
transitioning from ReFacto or other FVIII, Amendment 3 allowed enrollment of subjects who had more 
than 5 EDs to Xyntha prior to enrollment.  The study was conducted at 1 center in New Zealand and 
4 centers in the United States. 
The  study  had  both  observational  and  active  safety  surveillance  components  for  assessment.    During 
the active safety surveillance phase, FVIII inhibitor and FVIII recovery studies were performed at each 
visit.  For the observational safety surveillance phase, subjects were treated under standard care with 
Xyntha  at  a  dose  and  frequency  prescribed  by  the  treating  physician,  for  up  to  2 years.  No  efficacy 
data was collected. 
Only previously treated male subjects, 12 years of age and older, with >150 EDs to any recombinant 
or plasma-derived FVIII products were eligible to enroll, as per the recommendations from regulatory 
authorities and scientific advisory committees for the evaluation of FVIII inhibitor development.  
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate FVIII inhibitor development, defined as an inhibitor 
titer of ≥0.6 Bethesda Unit (BU) using the Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda assay and confirmed 
by the central laboratory, in subjects treated with Xyntha in usual use.   
The  secondary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  evaluate  the  overall  safety  of  Xyntha  in  this  subject 
population.   
Safety  was  assessed  through  the  collection  of  nonserious  adverse  events  (AEs)  and  serious  adverse 
events  (SAEs)  as  well  as  the  incidence  of  less-than-expected  therapeutic  effect  (LETE).    Events  of 
special circumstances (eg, inhibitor development and LETE) were reported in the same time frame as 
SAEs.

Overview of Safety results 
Twelve  (12)  of  the  14  subjects  who  signed  informed  consent  were  enrolled  and  treated  with  Xyntha.  
All subjects were male.  Ages ranged from 13 to 56 years; 3 subjects were aged less than 18 years (ie, 
13, 14, and 15 years).  Three (25%) subjects (1 pediatric) completed the study before the study was 
discontinued  by  the  Sponsor;  8  (67%)  subjects  did  not  complete  because  of  the  study  closure  and  1 
subject (aged 14 years) withdrew at his own request.   
For  the  12  subjects  included  in  this  report,  the  treatment  regimen  was  on  demand  for  6 subjects 
(including  1  pediatric  subject),  primary  prophylaxis  for  3  subjects  (including  2 pediatric  subjects), 
secondary  prophylaxis  for  2  subjects,  and  preventive  regimen  for  1 subject.    The  cumulative  total 
exposure for the 12 subjects was 1097 EDs (mean 91, median 71, range 16 to 342 days).  Exposure 
for pediatric subjects was 18, 48, and 342 EDs. 
Overall, 9 (75.0%) subjects had at least 1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) during the study.  
The  system  organ  classes  with  the  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  were  gastrointestinal  disorders 
(58.3%  subjects);  injury,  poisoning  and  procedural  complications  (50.0%  subjects);  infections  and 
infestations (33.3% subjects); musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (33.3% subjects); and 
general disorders and administration site (25.0% subjects).

The  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  were  arthralgia  and  nausea  (each  in  3 [25.0%]  subjects);  and 
vomiting  (2  [16.7%]  subjects).    The  majority  of  TEAEs  were  mild  or  moderate  in  severity.    TEAEs 
considered  to  be  severe  were  reported  for  4  subjects.    None  of  the AEs led to  a  subject's  withdrawal 
from the study.   
Two (2) subjects each had an SAE:  one case of therapeutic response decreased (LETE) was moderate 
in severity and was the only TEAE in the study that was considered to be treatment related; a case of 
tooth  impacted  was  considered  to  be  severe.    Both  SAEs  resolved  and  no  action  was  taken  with  the 
study drug due to the events. 
No  local  laboratory  results  0.6  BU  were  reported;  therefore,  no  positive  cases  from  the  central 
laboratory of FVIII inhibitor development were analyzed or reported. 
Of the 3 paediatric subjects, diarrhea, vomiting, and arthralgia were reported for 1 subject; sinusitis, 
head injury, and nausea for a second subject; and no TEAEs were reported for the third subject.  All of 
these TEAEs were mild and resolved.  None were SAEs.   
Conclusions of the MAH 
No  occurrences  of  FVIII  inhibitor  development  were  observed  during  this  study,  and  no  new  safety 
risks  or  concerns  were  identified.    Xyntha  was  safe  and  well  tolerated  during  the  study  as  assessed 
through  the  collection  of  nonserious  AEs  and  SAEs  as  well  as  the  incidence  of  LETE.    The  study  was 
discontinued because the Sponsor has ongoing studies collecting similar safety data  
Conclusion of the Rapporteur 
The MAH has submitted the results from an open label study evaluating the overall safety of Xyntha in 
subjects  transitioning  from  ReFacto  or  other  FVIII  replacement  products  to  Xyntha  in  usual  care 
setting.  Twelve  male  subjects,  ages  ranging  from  13  to  56  years  with  3  subjects  aged  less  than  18 
years (i.e., 13, 14, and 15) received the Refacto AF version approved in US and the study took place 
outside Europe. 
The  collected  safety  data  did  not  reveal  any  new  adverse  events  and  no  reports  of  inhibitors  were 
obtained. As the study also is terminated by the sponsor no more data is expected.  
Being a small study with limited information it is somewhat difficult to make any definitive conclusions 
but based on the information and reports provided it is considered that the study results do not affect 
the currently approved SmPC for Refacto AF in the EU nor does it change the overall benefit/risk.

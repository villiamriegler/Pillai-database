Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Ceprotin 
human protein C 
On 10 November 2022, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
Ceprotin. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Takeda Manufacturing Austria 
AG. 
The CHMP adopted an extension to the existing indication to include the prophylaxis of purpura fulminans 
and coumarin-induced skin necrosis as well as the prophylaxis and treatment of venous thrombotic 
events. 
For information, the full indications for Ceprotin will therefore be as follows:2  
CEPROTIN is indicated for prophylaxis and treatment of purpura fulminans, coumarin-induced 
skin necrosis and venous thrombotic events in patients with severe congenital protein C 
deficiency.  
Furthermore, CEPROTIN is indicated for short-term prophylaxis in patients with severe 
congenital protein C deficiency if one or more of the following conditions are met:  
• surgery or invasive therapy is imminent  
• while initiating coumarin therapy  
• when coumarin therapy alone is not sufficient  
• when coumarin therapy is not feasible. 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of 
product characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to 
the marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
PNH is a rare, chronic, life-threatening blood disorder associated with anaemia due to haemolysis. 
Haemolysis can result in a range of debilitating consequences such as severe fatigue, chest pain, and 
transfusion dependence, all of which contribute to the heavy disease burden and reduced quality of life 
(QoL) these patients experience. Even with C5 inhibitor treatment, 72% of patients with PNH remain 
anaemic and 36% require 1 or more transfusions per year (McKinley et al. 2017). If left untreated, 
PNH can cause severe and potentially fatal complications for patients. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
PNH has an annual incidence of 1-10 new cases per 1 million individuals. The median age of diagnosis 
is in the early thirties; it affects men and women in equal proportions and has no clear ethnic or 
geographic preferences (Stern and Connell 2019). 
2.1.3.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
PNH is associated with a high burden of disease. The most prevalent symptoms are fatigue (80%), 
dyspnea (64%), and hemoglobinuria (62%). PNH commonly results in clinically significant hematologic 
consequences from chronic hemolysis including a marked increase in risk of thromboembolism, which 
may ultimately lead to target organ damage and death (Schrezenmeier et al. 2014). 
2.1.4.  Management 
To most effectively manage PNH, both IVH and EVH need to be controlled. This is reflected in 
improvements across the following key markers of disease activity: haemoglobin level, LDH level, ARC, 
bilirubin level, transfusion requirements, and FACIT-Fatigue score. The C5 inhibitors eculizumab and 
ravulizumab have increased survival and improved outcomes in PNH by controlling IVH, reflected in 
LDH improvements; however, C5 inhibitors do not control EVH. In many patients treated with C5 
inhibitors, although LDH is largely controlled, ARC and bilirubin levels remain elevated, indicative of 
ongoing haemolysis. Pegcetacoplan (Aspaveli) has been recently approved and binds to complement 
protein C3 and its activation fragment C3b with high affinity, thereby regulating the cleavage of C3 and 
the generation of downstream effectors of complement activation. 
2.2.  About the product 
Samsung Bioepis has developed SB12 as a proposed similar biological medicinal product to Soliris. 
SB12 and Soliris have identical primary structure and the active substance for both products is 
eculizumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody.  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Selective immunosuppressants, ATC code: L04AA25 
Eculizumab contains human constant regions and murine complementarity-determining regions grafted 
onto the human framework light- and heavy-chain variable regions. 
Assessment report  
EMA/203468/2023  
Page 11/129 
 
 
 
Eculizumab binds to the human C5 complement protein with high affinity. Binding to this protein blocks 
its cleavage into C5a and C5b, thereby inhibiting terminal complement-mediated intravascular 
haemolysis. 
The claimed therapeutic indication is similar to the indication of Soliris for the treatment of PNH as the 
market exclusivity period for Soliris’s PNH indication ended in June 2019: 
SB12 is indicated in adults and children for the treatment of Paroxysmal nocturnal 
haemoglobinuria (PNH).  
Evidence of clinical benefit is demonstrated in patients with haemolysis with clinical symptom(s) 
indicative of high disease activity, regardless of transfusion history (see section 5.1). 
Soliris is also indicated in the treatment of atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), refractory 
generalised myasthenia gravis (gMG) in patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody-
positive, and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), but these indications are still protected 
by orphan exclusivity. For this MAA of SB12, the applicant intends to claim PNH, which is one of the 
indications granted for Soliris in the EU. 
2.3.  Type of application and aspects on development 
2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The finished product (FP) is presented as concentrate for solution for infusion, containing 300 mg of 
eculizumab as active substance.   
Other ingredients are: sodium dihydrogen phosphate monohydrate disodium hydrogen phosphate 
heptahydrate, trehalose dihydrate, polysorbate 80 and water for injections. 
The product is available in a vial (Type I glass) with a stopper (coated chlorinated butyl rubber), and a 
seal (aluminium) with flip-off cap (polypropylene). 
2.4.2.  Active substance 
2.4.2.1.  General information 
The INN name of the active substance of Epysqli (company code SB12) is eculizumab. SB12 is a full-
length IgG2/4 kappa isotype antibody composed of two identical light chains (214 amino acid residues) 
and two heavy chains (448 residues) with a total molecular weight of 148 kDa. One N-linked 
glycosylation site is located at Asn298 on each heavy chain. Eculizumab binds to the human C5 
complement protein and inhibits C5 cleavage to C5a and C5b, preventing the generation of the 
terminal complement complex C5b-9 and thus blocking complement-mediated cell lysis and activation 
(intravascular haemolysis). 
SB12 has been developed as a biosimilar to the reference product Soliris, originally approved in the EU 
in June 2007 (EMEA/H/C/000791).

2.4.2.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The SB12 active substance is manufactured in Patheon facility in Woolloongabba, Australia. All relevant 
manufacturing, testing and cell bank storage sites have been listed, GMP compliance for all listed sites 
is confirmed.  
The active substance (AS) manufacturing is well described: the up-stream process begins with thawing 
of a vial of the working cell bank, which is a Chinese Hamster Ovary cell line transfected with SB12 
expression vector. After thawing of the WCB vial, the culture is serially expanded in cell mass and 
volume for inoculation into the production bioreactor. 
The down-stream process starts with the affinity chromatography step: Harvested cell culture fluid is 
initially captured and purified by affinity chromatography. The eluate is collected and undergoes a low 
pH virus inactivation step before being further purified in series of chromatography. Subsequently, the 
product is passed through a series of filters for virus reduction, concentrated and buffer exchanged 
using tangential flow filtration. The final ultrafiltration pool is formulated with formulation buffer, and 
then filtered into AS bags. The filled AS bags are stored frozen.  
Flow charts providing a high level overview of the manufacturing process as well as detailed narrative 
descriptions of the individual steps were included. Process controls (e.g. those impacting critical 
process parameters) as well as performance parameters (e.g. in-process tests) have been indicated in 
the manufacturing process description. Definitions of these process and performance parameters was 
provided in the dossier.  
The batch and scales have been appropriately defined. One batch of AS is filled into multiple bags. 
Control of materials 
The raw and starting materials are briefly presented. Tabulated overviews of compendial and non-
compendial materials used in the manufacturing process are shown. For the non-compendial materials 
in-house tests will be performed; for the majority of non-compendial materials the applicant indicates 
to perform testing in order to verify the manufacturer CoA certificates of analysis (CoAs). For non-
compendial raw materials used in SB12 AS manufacturing process Certificates of analysis (CoAs) have 
been provided. Microbial control of cell culture reagents was sufficiently described.  
The compositions of the media used in the SB12 cell culture process were provided. The applicant 
confirms that the change notification would be made in case of change. The composition of solutions 
for the purification process was included in the dossier. 
Raw materials of animal origin used for SB12 host cell construction and cell line development as well 
as materials of biological origin used during the active substance manufacturing process are listed as 
well. A detailed discussion on the materials of animal origin is described in the dossier. 
The source, history and generation of the cell line has been appropriately described: The host cell line 
is Chinese hamster ovary cell line. The DNA fragments coding SB12 heavy chain and SB12 light chain 
were chemically synthesized based on the reference amino acid sequence of Soliris. The expression 
plasmid vectors were prepared and introduced into the host cells by transfection. The production cell 
line was generated by stable pool selection and single clone selection in chemically defined media.  
The cell bank system is comprised of the master and the working cell bank. Appropriate information in 
accordance with ICH Q5A and Q5D on the establishment, testing/characterisation, and storage of the 
cell banks has been provided. A new expiry date is assigned to cell banks after periodical stability 
testing. The manufacturing and testing strategy in case of replacement of the working cell bank has 
been described. In addition to the master and the working cell bank, an end of production cell bank for

SB12 was generated and tested to characterise the stability of cell line at the end of its usable life 
cycle. Finally, stability of the SB12 cell substrate was confirmed by genetic and phenotypic analysis 
methods. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates  
The process control strategy is generally endorsed. The control of the active substance manufacturing 
process is described in the dossier: The process controls are divided into process parameters (inputs) 
and performance parameters (outputs). Key and critical process parameters as well as in-process 
gateways, critical in-process gateways (CIPGs), in-process tests (IPTs), and critical in-process tests 
(CIPTs) have been defined. For each individual manufacturing step, process and performance 
parameters with their respective action ranges and/or in-process specifications are outlined. The 
initially proposed control strategy of host cell proteins (HCPs) was not accepted and consequently 
implementation of a release specification was requested. To address the concern an in-process 
specification (IPS) and a revised action range was set. This improved control strategy can be accepted. 
A brief description of the used HCP assay was given. The method has been validated according to ICH 
Guideline Q2 (R1). 
Process validation and/or verification 
Process validation included a number of studies which investigated a) process performance 
qualification (PPQ) of both the cell culture and the purification process, b) impurity clearance to show 
that the intended purification process is able to reduce the impurities to acceptable levels in 
accordance with the pre-determined acceptance criteria, c) hold times for process intermediates, d) 
resin lifetime to demonstrate that the chromatography column resins are capable of maintaining 
acceptable performance characteristics over extensive cycling, and e) the shipping qualification. 
Several PPQ batches had been produced, and met the acceptance criteria. Based on the results of the 
process validation, the manufacturing process is considered validated for active substance commercial 
manufacturing. However, a single batch was terminated due to the presence of microbial 
contaminants. Since there was no breach of GMP practice with low possibility of recurrence and 
immediate detection of the event was performed, the risk category was determined as low with the 
requirement of an investigation for root cause analysis. A detailed summary of the conducted root 
cause investigation of this microbial contamination during process validation has been submitted. 
Based on the investigation results, it was concluded that there was no process or product impact due 
to termination of the certain batch. An alternative batch was started as a replacement batch and met 
all pre-determined specification.  
The clearance studies of process-related impurities involved studies for cell derived impurities (HCP, 
host cell DNA), cell-culture process derived impurities, and impurities derived from the downstream 
purification process (protein A leachate). Impurity clearance was validated by using direct 
measurements of the impurities in process intermediates for the PPQ batches, or by using scale-down 
spiking models. The overall clearance factor for certain impurities was calculated and the lowest 
detected log reduction value (LRV) was considered effective in impurity reduction. Presented data from 
PPQ batches and clearance studies of process-related impurities demonstrated that their levels are well 
below their acceptable daily intake (ADI).  
Resins lifetime studies to evaluate the performance of chromatography resins used in the purification 
process were performed at laboratory scale based on the scale-down models to determine appropriate 
resin lifetimes without any potential product loss and impact on process performance and product 
quality. In addition to the resin life cycle studies performed at small scale, the applicant evaluates the 
lifetime of the resins at manufacturing scale. Data for output parameters will be collected according to 
a protocol until the maximum number of cycles is reached. These protocols for evaluation of the resin 
lifetimes at manufacturing scale have been submitted and are satisfactory.  
Assessment report  
EMA/203468/2023  
Page 14/129 
 
 
 
Appropriate hold time stability studies in order to qualify that process intermediates are stable for their 
maximum allowable holding times have been conducted. Intermediate hold times for commercial 
manufacturing have been established based on the validated hold times and can be agreed on. 
By shipping qualification studies, the shipping system was validated to assure the quality of the 
product.  
Manufacturing process development 
In the section Manufacturing Process Development the outcome of a quality attribute risk assessment 
in order to categorise individual product quality attributes either critical or non-critical was presented. 
The methodology employed for quality attribute risk assessment of SB12 was a modified risk ranking 
and filtering, in which the potential impact on efficacy (potency), immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics 
(PK)/pharmacodynamics (PD), safety of the product, and the uncertainty were factored into 
determining the degree of risk. Numerical scoring systems for the ‘impact factor’ and ‘uncertainty 
factor’ were used to determine the overall risk score, defined as the ‘risk priority number (RPN)’.The 
methodology as well as the proposed classification of quality attributes in critical and non-critical 
attributes can be agreed.  
The development history of the AS manufacturing process was summarised including a process 
description from the pilot-scale to the commercial scale process. The pilot manufacturing process was 
developed based on the laboratory scale experiments to support the development for a clinical 
manufacturing process. The clinical manufacturing process was further developed to the PPQ 
manufacturing process, only minor changes were introduced from the clinical to the process validation 
manufacturing. The development of the manufacturing process was done on several process risk 
assessments as well as on process characterisation studies conducted on appropriately qualified scale 
down models. Finally, the applicant introduced some changes post-PPQ activities in the input and 
output parameters which were revised. The revision took place by the process knowledge gained from 
the validation campaign, manufacturing experience, additional process characterisation results, risk 
assessments, and overall process capabilities taken into account. Following the post PPQ activities the 
applicant indicated that an in-process test was removed. The applicant will continue to monitor this 
parameter during 30 batches or more. The control strategy will be re-classified after 30 batches or 
more based on the monitored results.  
In order to ensure that the batches used at each stage of SB12 development are representative of 
subsequent development stages, and that changes in the manufacturing process at each stage of 
development do not affect product quality, two comparability studies were conducted. Comparability 
assessment was performed based on the quality attributes for release test items and extended 
characterisation studies. The extended characterisation included physicochemical and biological assays. 
In addition, comparative stability studies were performed to evaluate the degradation patterns among 
SB12 batches (pilot, clinical, and PPQ active substance batches).  
The first study evaluated the comparability between SB12 clinical and PPQ batches, and the second 
study the comparability between SB12 pilot and clinical batches. Comparability between active 
substance materials derived from the different process version has been demonstrated, some issues 
identified in the first assessment round could be solved with the responses. These issues were related 
to the calculation of comparability range. The applicant re-calculated comparability range with more 
appropriate narrow range and re-assessed batches with re-calculated range in the responses. Some of 
the results were slightly outside the re-calculated comparability range. But the applicant`s justification 
for these outliers can be followed and the conclusion that these slight differences observed are not 
considered significant can be accepted.  
Assessment report  
EMA/203468/2023  
Page 15/129 
 
 
 
As requested the data from the individual batches used for the initial calculation of the comparability 
ranges are provided. These data also confirm a comparable quality profile of the different process 
version. 
An extensive and sound discussion on the applied statistics has been provided which is considered 
appropriate.  
In addition comparability between pilot and clinical batches has been sufficiently established. Batch 
release results of several produced pilot AS,  clinical AS, and  clinical FP batches are shown and do not 
indicate any significant differences between pilot and clinical batches. Together with the data from the 
comparative in-depth characterisation showing comparability of primary and higher order structure 
comparability between pilot and clinical batches is confirmed. 
Characterisation 
SB12 was characterised by a comprehensive battery of physicochemical and biological tests using 
sensitive and orthogonal state-of-the art qualified analytical methods in accordance with ICH Guideline 
Q6B. For the majority of quality attributes characterisation was conducted with PPQ active substance 
as well as with PPQ drug product batches. The selection of AS and FP batches included into the in-
depth characterisation of SB12 is appropriate and agreed. 
Primary structure and post-translational modifications included characterisation of molecular weights, 
amino acid sequencing, peptide mapping, N- and C-terminal sequencing, determination of the 
extinction coefficient, and characterisation of oxidation and deamidation variants. Glycan profiles were 
studied via identification of N-linked glycosylation sites, N-glycan identification, and N-glycan profiling. 
One glycosylation site (N-linked) has been identified. The purity/impurity profile and charged variants 
were investigated by orthogonal method. Hydrophobic heterogeneities were also analysed. In-depth 
characterisation of higher order structures was comprised of combination of methods to find out 
specific structural charcter of the protein.,Protein concentration and subvisible particles were also 
analysed in characterisation.. 
In summary an extensive in-depth characterisation of the relevant physicochemical has been 
performed and the relevant discussion has been presented satisfactorily.  
Biological characterisation was performed by an cell-based C5 inhibition assay, an anti-hemolytic 
assay, a C5 binding assay via ELISA and an FcRn binding assay via SPR. These assays aim mostly on 
high criticality attributes of SB12 and precisely reflect the mode of action of eculizumab. Additional 
biological characterisation included an orthogonal C5 binding assay by SPR, binding to Fcy receptors by 
SPR, and binding to C1q by an ELISA. These assays that are not expected to be relevant for safety and 
efficacy of the molecule since eculizumab has hybrid human IgG2-IgG4 heavy-chain constant regions, 
which have been reported to be unable to activate CDC or bind to the Fc-γ receptor of effector cells. 
Functional activities related to the Fc domain Fc effector functions are not significantly involved in the 
MoA; this is agreeable. Finally, binding to C5 polymorphic variants was studied by an ELISA. In 
conclusion, the set of binding and cell-based assays is considered sufficient for biological 
characterisation of SB12.  
Impurities 
A brief discussion of the potential product- and process-related impurities in SB12 active substance has 
been provided. Process-related impurities include HCP and host cell DNA, protein A, leachate. During 
active substance manufacturing process development, process-related impurities in the “in-process 
samples” of clinical and PPQ batches were monitored as IPT or in-process measurement (IPM). The test 
results were reported along with their action range for IPTs, or simply reported to evaluate process 
consistency for IPMs.  
Assessment report  
EMA/203468/2023  
Page 16/129 
 
 
 
Product-related impurities include high-molecular and low-molecular species. The levels of product-
related impurities were determined using two orthogonal methods. In addition to the size-related 
impurities, charge variants can also be thought as impurities. Although the relative contents of the  
charge variants have been included in the SB12 AS release specification, the applicant showed that 
charge variants have no impact on the biological activities.  
Container closure system 
The container closure comprises the multi-layered film structure bags The bags are sterilised by 
gamma irradiation and are certified BSE/TSE free in compliance with the EMA guideline “Note for 
guidance on minimising the risk of transmitting animal spongiform encephalopathy agents via human 
and veterinary medicinal products” (EMEA/410/01 Rev.3) and Ph. Eur. 5.2.8. “Minimising the Risk of 
Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents via Human and Veterinary Medical Products”. 
As secondary packaging, the bag is covered by a protective shell.  
Extractable studies have been conducted in order to determine the extractable amount of chemical 
compounds which may migrate from the AS container closure system into model solvents of interest.  
Organic compounds observed from these analyses went through a toxicological risk assessment. The 
calculated tolerable exposure threshold (TE) and safety margins for each of these extractables, 
detected in all solvent extracts of the SB12 AS storage bag, were provided. 
The toxicological risk assessment conducted in the extracts showed that the organic compounds 
detected and identified were present at levels not expected to pose a risk of adverse effects. A safety 
margin for a single unit was calculated assuming the worst-case scenario. Summarising, the 
assumption of the applicant, that the risk of detecting any of the listed extractables in the final product 
is extremely low, can be followed.  
Based on the results of the of the extractables study, which demonstrated a safety margin high enough 
to conclude on a very low toxicological risk to the finished product, the applicant considered leachable 
studies not necessary. Furthermore, the applicant outlined the long-term storage conditions where 
release of leachables from the container closure system into the AS is unlikely to occur. Taking these 
considerations into account, the omission of leachable studies is acceptable. 
2.4.2.3.  Specification 
The AS release and shelf life specifications include tests for general tests (appearance, osmolality, pH), 
identity (icIEF), quantity (protein concentration), biological activity (bioassay), purity and impurities 
(SE-HPLC, CE-SDS, icIEF), and safety (endotoxins, microbial enumeration).  
The proposed specifications address relevant quality attributes; however, no routine release tests for 
any of the potential process-related impurities is included in the specifications. The proposed limits and 
control strategy for controlling impurity were sufficiently justified and are acceptable. 
The applicant has proven that the clearance of HC DNA, Protein A as well as HCPs impurities is 
sufficient.  
AS (and FP) endotoxin release acceptance criteria has been tightened, in order to allow Epysqli a 
sufficient safety margin that has been validated over years of clinical practice in patients being treated 
with Soliris.  
Analytical procedures 
An overview of the analytical procedures used for release and stability testing was presented. Either 
Ph. Eur. methods are used or brief descriptions of the non-Ph. Eur. methods are provided. Validation 
reports for the non-Ph. Eur. methods have been included whereas the safety relevant methods 
Assessment report  
EMA/203468/2023  
Page 17/129 
 
 
 
(endotoxin and microbial enumeration) have been verified to be suitable for their use. The methods 
have been appropriately validated and are considered suitable as release and stability test for SB12.  
The AS biological activity is controlled by: 
- a C5 ELISA-based binding assay was designed to measure the relative binding activity of eculizumab 
AS and FP to Reference Standard.  
- a C5 inhibition assay to determine the relative potency of eculizumab AS and FP to Reference 
Standard. C1q interacts with the Fc region of anti-CD20 antibody after binding to CD20 on the B-cell 
surface, thus activating the classical complement cascade and a membrane attack complex (MAC) is 
inserted into the cell membrane, with multiple MACs leading to cytolysis.. The relative potency of 
eculizumab can be determined by measuring the inhibition of cytotoxicity. 
A description of the used HCP assay was also given. The method is an SB12 process-specific assay 
based on sandwich immunoassay using polyclonal antibodies produced against HCPs, which is the cell 
line used to produce SB12. The HCP assay has been validated according to ICH Guideline Q2 (R1).  
Certain tests used for release testing are not included in the stability testing. The provided justification 
for omission of these tests is agreed. 
Reference standards  
The applicant has described its reference standards used throughout the development of SB12. 
Different classes of reference standards including the Research Reference Standards, the Interim 
Reference Standard, the Clinical Reference Standard, the Primary Reference Standard and the Working 
Reference Standard were defined.   
An appropriately characterised in-house primary reference standard (PRS) has been prepared from 
appropriate AS batch considered representative of production. Primary reference standard was 
qualified against previous reference standard by using validated or qualified analytical methods. This 
strategy of potency assignment used for the primary reference standard is acceptable and will also be 
used for qualification of future primary reference standards. 
The stability program in place for the primary reference standard has been sufficiently described. The 
currently available stability data do not indicate any trends or abnormalities. Consequently, an expiry 
date is agreed.  
The ICH guidance Q6B states that an in-house working reference material(s) used in the testing of 
production lots should be calibrated against this primary reference material. The applicant indicated 
that a working reference standard (WRS) will be prepared in 2nd quarter (Q2) of 2023, and will be 
implemented via post-approval variation procedure. Currently, the PRS is used for QC release and 
stability testing of SB12 AS and FP batches until the WRS is established and qualified for routine use. 
The current reference standard system comprised of the primary reference standard is well managed 
until the WRS is established. Based on this justification the implementation of the WRS post-approval 
can be accepted (REC).  
Batch analyses 
Batch release data from AS batches produced so far have been presented. The AS batches complied 
with the specifications valid at the time of testing. In general, the batch analyses data confirm that the 
drug substance manufacturing process is able produce consistently material meeting predefined quality 
criteria. 
The specifications and their acceptance criteria have been justified and are agreed. In order to 
establish the commercial acceptance criteria from batch analysis data, the historical AS and/or FP 
batches were evaluated.  
Assessment report  
EMA/203468/2023  
Page 18/129 
 
 
 
2.4.2.4.  Stability 
The applicant provided the stability data of eculizumab AS for supporting the proposed shelf-life.  
Real time stability data at long-term storage condition was provided for a pilot, clinical, PPQ batches. 
For the same batches, also stability data from the completed stability studies under accelerated 
storage condition was provided. 
The applicant claims that the above batches can be used for establishing the shelf life claim as 
representativeness for the commercial product is shown. Since any uncertainties identified in the 
comparability studies in the dossier have been appropriately addressed, this conclusion can be 
followed.  
Regarding available stability data, no out-of-specification results and no significant trends have been 
observed when stored at long-term storage condition and thus indicate that the AS is stable under 
long-term storage conditions.  
In summary there is a sufficient stability data available which confirms that eculizumab AS is stable for 
proposed shelf-life. Consequently, the proposed shelf-life for eculizumab AS can be accepted. 
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Epysqli finished product is a sterile, clear, colourless, preservative-free solution and presented as a 
single-use vial containing 300 mg of eculizumab for concentrate for solution for infusion intravenously. 
Epysqli has been developed as a similar biological medicinal product (biosimilar) to the reference 
medicinal product Soliris.  
The formulation of the FP contains 10 mg/mL eculizumab, trehalose dihydrate,  sodium phosphate 
monobasic monohydrate, sodium phosphate dibasic heptahydrate, and polysorbate 80. The formulation 
is similar to the reference product Soliris but buffering agents are in different concentrations and the 
stabiliser is trehalose dihydrate and not sodium chloride. Formulation studies with different stabiliser 
and the stability under various conditions were performed. As a result, trehalose dihydrate was found 
better to stabilise Epysqli. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 
2.4.1 of this report. 
All physicochemical and biological properties of the FP are closely correlated with the characteristics of 
the AS.  
Epysqli FP is intended for intravenous infusion. The total amount of Epysqli FP from the vial is 
withdrawn using a sterile syringe and the recommended dose is transferred to an infusion bag. In the 
infusion bag, Epysqli FP is diluted to required concentration with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) 
solution for injection, sodium chloride 4.5 mg/ml (0.45%) solution for injection or 5% dextrose in 
water. The suitability of the formulation has been assessed in in-use stability studies. Therefore, no 
dedicated compatibility studies have been conducted. 
Epysqli clinical FP batches and PPQ batches were manufactured at the same FP manufacturer. Epysqli 
PPQ FP manufacturing process is similar to that of Epysqli clinical FP but many minor process changes 
proposed for process optimisation. 
The applicant presented a risk assessment where these changes in the manufacturing of the clinical 
batches and the PPQ batches are estimated as low risk. Comparability data of the clinical batches with 
the PPQ batches at FP level have been presented in the dossier. 
Assessment report  
EMA/203468/2023  
Page 19/129 
 
 
 
Further a comparison of process controls between Epysqli PPQ and post PPQ batches was performed. 
The rationale to every process parameter of the manufacturing steps was given and classification 
changes were sufficiently justified. Process characterisation studies were performed. 
An engineering batch has been manufactured in order to verify manufacturing process parameters and 
process consistency like mixing, sterile filtration steps, different filling studies and visual inspection. 
Satisfactory results were obtained. 
The FP primary packaging material consists of a Type I glass vial and a rubber stopper. Container 
closure integrity has been studied during development of Epysqli FP and this test is included in the on-
going stability studies. 
In order to assess the suitability of the container closure system, extractables and leachables studies 
were conducted. Experimental design and description of the analytical methods (GC/MS and LC/MS) for 
“extractables and leachables” are well presented.  In the “extractables” study a number of volatile 
organic compounds (VOC) and semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOC) and non-volatile organic 
compounds (NVOC) were detected which were at or above the reporting level and they might be found 
in the FP in extreme conditions. The extractable compounds that are expected to be at or above the 
AET (analytical evaluation threshold) level will be monitored by the applicant during the ongoing 
leachables study, regardless of their volatility. The compounds will be continuously monitored at 
further time points in this study and subject to toxicological assessment if necessary. The applicant 
commits to submit the results for the remaining time points of the leachable study under long-term 
and accelerated storage conditions when these data become available (REC). 
2.4.3.1.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Epysqli FP manufacturing process was validated at the proposed commercial manufacturing site. This 
facility could provide  GMP certificates upon the request of the CHMP (Major Objection) and addresses 
any inquiry on the manufacturing activities of Epysqli product. 
FP testing site is the same as for the. Its valid GMP certificate is available. EU batch release is 
conducted by Samsung Bioepis in Delft, Netherlands. The submitted GMP certificate is older than three 
years (issued in May 2019) but this extension can be accepted based on the QUESTIONS AND 
ANSWERS ON REGULATORY EXPECTATIONS FOR MEDICINAL PRODUCTS FOR HUMAN USE DURING 
THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC stating that “The validity of GMP certificates for manufacturing/importing 
sites of active substances and/or finished products in the EEA should be extended until the end of 2023 
without the need for further action from the holder of the certificate”.  
The manufacturing process is sufficiently described and a flowchart was presented. The process is 
divided into 7 steps starting from AS thawing and ending to storage. Homogeneity of pooled AS and 
product quality is ensured by validated manufacturing process and in-process testing. The main 
procedures are filtration to reduce bioburden into the pooling vessel, mixing, sterile filtration and 
aseptic filling, stoppering/capping into vials.  
In-process tests and controls are clearly presented and are adequately defined to each step where it is 
applicable. Furthermore, critical and key controlled parameters are defined to all steps applicable. 
The control strategy in place for the FP manufacturing process is adequate. 
Process validation of the SB12 FP manufacturing process has been carried out in the production facility 
of FP manufacturer. The manufacturing process has been validated on several consecutive PPQ batches 
according to the commercial process. Critical process parameters and critical quality attributes are 
taken into account and validated in each step applicable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/203468/2023  
Page 20/129 
 
 
 
Filter sterility for Epysqli FP manufacturing was successfully validated by the manufacturer of the filter.  
Media fill qualification was successfully conducted at the Epysqli FP manufacturing site, applying a 
bracketing approach. The data of this media fills are acceptable. Validation of the aseptic process was 
performed with several media fill runs.  
Shipping qualification is performed for the Epysqli FP in bulk packaging and final packaging to ensure 
shipping stability.  
2.4.3.2.  Product specification 
The finished product release and shelf-life specifications includes tests for general tests (appearance 
(clarity, colour, visible particles), osmolality, pH),  identity (icIEF), quantity (protein concentration, 
extractable volume), biological activity (bioassay), purity and impurities (SE-HPLC, CE-SDS, icIEF), and 
safety (sterility, endotoxins, container closure integrity, particulates). 
The panel of analytical procedures is adequate to monitor and control SB12 FP quality at release and 
during shelf life. The current control strategy for Polysorbate 80 content in AS and FP is sufficiently 
described and the justification acceptable. 
The acceptance criteria of shelf-life specifications for some tests were questioned and tightened during 
the procedure considering also clinically qualified purity profile for the reference product Soliris.  
Nitrosamine impurity risk assessment has been conducted in accordance with the EMA principles 
outlined in the “Assessment report Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004” 
(EMA/369136/2020)”. In conclusion, no risk of nitrosamine contamination in Epysqli AS manufacturing 
process was concluded for Epysqli finished product and therefore, no additional control measures are 
deemed necessary. 
A risk assessment on the potential presence of elemental impurities in the FP has been performed. As 
a result of the assessment, potential risks associated to the elemental impurities were shown to be 
almost low in all aspects. No elemental impurity was identified to be above the PDE level for parenteral 
products according to ICH Q3D. No further controls for elemental impurities seem required. 
An overview of the analytical procedures used for release and stability testing of FP was presented. The 
panel of analytical procedures is adequate to monitor and control Epysqli drug substance quality at 
release and during shelf life. The analytical methods specific for the FP only are particulate matter, 
sterility and container closure integrity. The validation reports of the analytical procedures used for 
Epysqli FP release and stability testing were presented.  
The reference standards used in the release and stability testing of the FP are the same as those used 
for the release and stability testing of the AS (discussed previously). 
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data are presented for FP lots used for small scale pilot, clinical trials, stability and 
process validation. All lots met the acceptance criteria in place at the time of release. The results 
demonstrate consistency of the manufacturing process capabilities. All lots comply with the commercial 
acceptance criteria. 
2.4.3.3.  Stability of the product 
The proposed shelf life of Epysqli FP is 36 months when stored at the recommended temperature of 
5 ± 3 °C.  
Assessment report  
EMA/203468/2023  
Page 21/129 
 
 
 
Stability studies were conducted in accordance with ICH Guidelines Q1A (R2). The container closure 
material used for stability studies is identical to that used for the commercial product. 
The applicant provided the stability data of Epysqli FP for supporting the proposed shelf-life.  
Long-term stability studies for several batches were presented. All submitted results in the long-term 
stability studies come from these batches which are considered to be representative of the commercial 
batch since comparability has been successfully demonstrated. All quality attributes of the long-term 
stability study met the acceptance criteria after 36 months. Accelerated and stress data are also 
available and acceptable. 
To investigate the impact of temperature excursion during handling and transport to product quality, 
two temperature cycling studies were conducted; a short-term temperature cycling study and a supply 
chain cycling study. The results support Epysqli FP stability in the immediate pack when exposed to 
either repeated short-term excursions at extreme temperature conditions or to temperature cycles in 
the supply chain. 
A photostability study was designed  and conducted according to ICH Guideline Q1B Stability Testing. 
All observed changes were within acceptance criteria. The results confirm that the commercial pack 
sufficiently protects the FP since there were no significant differences in all quality attributes between 
the dark control and the exposed sample. 
An in-use study was conducted for Epysqli DP diluted in 5% dextrose in water and 0.9% and 0.45% 
NaCl solution diluent. In accordance with the results of this study the in-use storage condition in the 
SmPC section 6.3 has been set after dilution. 
Finally a room temperature stability study monitored the stability profile of unopened Epysqli FP during 
exposure at room temperature. This study was performed using FP aged to the shelf-life. Results from 
the study support the storage condition and duration described in the Product Information SmPC 
(section 6.3 and 6.4). 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 3 years with the storage conditions “2°C – 
8 °C” as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3 and 6.4) are acceptable. 
2.4.3.4.  Biosimilarity 
In general, a comprehensive and well-established biosimilarity exercise has been conducted. EU Soliris 
was used as the reference medicinal product (RMP) in quality exercises and clinical studies while US 
Soliris was used in clinical phase III study. As US-sourced comparator product was also used in the 
pivotal phase III study the applicant has conducted a three-way comparison between Epysqli, EU and 
US Soliris. EU-sourced RMP lots and US-sourced comparators lots have been included into the 
similarity exercise and compare against several produced batches of Epysqli. These Epysqli batches 
were comprised of PPQ FP, clinical FP and PPQ AS batch. FP batches included into the biosimilarity 
exercise were manufactured from independent AS batches. The number of RMP lots (and comparator 
lots for the 3-way comparison) is agreed as it forms a solid basis for evaluation of the variability in 
quality attributes of RMP. Regarding the proposed biosimilar the inclusion of clinical and process 
validation drug product lots is acknowledged.  
Based on a risk assessment, which evaluated the potential impact on efficacy (potency), 
immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics (PK)/pharmacodynamics (PD), and safety of the product, quality 
attributes were categorised into three different tiers (high, moderate and low criticality tiers). The 
details of the performed risk assessment have been provided in the dossier.  
Assessment report  
EMA/203468/2023  
Page 22/129 
 
 
 
Quality attributes reflecting the mode of action, have been assigned to the high-risk tier. A limited 
number of further quality attributes mainly related to the purity/impurity profile, the charged variant 
profile, quantity and certain further biological assays have been classified as moderate risk attributes 
whereas the remaining quality attributes have been classified as low criticality attributes. Depending on 
this classification different statistical tools for establishment of biosimilarity ranges and different 
numbers of RMP (and comparator) lots have been used for similarity evaluation of the quality 
attributes.  
A broad panel of standard and state-of-the-art methods has been applied for similarity evaluation and 
addresses all relevant physicochemical and biological characteristics of the eculizumab molecule. 
Qualification information on methods and assays used for comparative characterization of the 
molecules is included now. It was stated that analytical methods to evaluate physicochemical 
properties were calibrated and qualified in accordance with ICH Q2 (R1), which is endorsed. Method 
suitability was ensured by periodical calibration when appropriate or with internal known standard or 
control testing. Method qualification characteristics to evaluate quality-related properties included 
specificity, linearity, accuracy, precision, ranges, limits of detection and robustness. For biological 
assays the applicant used known controls and standards ensuring method suitability for biological 
assays. The applicant presented tables with tests and analytical methods for similarity attributes as an 
overview and further goes into more detail with each method suitable for each quality attribute 
investigated during comparability assessment. Performance characteristics and results are tabularly 
outlined.  A tabulated summary of the tests and analytical methods used in similarity assessment is 
presented in Table 1.

by LC-ESI-MS, N- and C-terminal sequencing by LC-ESI-MS, extinction coefficient analysis by SEC-
MALS, oxidation by LC-ESI-MS, and deamidation by LC-ESI-MS. 
Comparison of glycan profiles included the identification of N-linked glycosylation site using LC-ESI-MS, 
N-glycan identification by LC-ESI-MS, and determination of the relative contents of the identified N-
glycans by using HILIC-UPLC. 
Purity and product-related impurities were investigated by SE-HPLC to evaluate the relative contents of 
high molecular weight species and monomer. In addition, CE-SDS under reducing & non-reducing 
conditions was applied to measure the relative contents of LC and HC as well as the level of various 
types of mis-assembled species such as single LC, HC, two heavy chain and one light chain (2H1L), 
and other fragmented species.  
In order to evaluate the charge variants (%Acidic, %Main, and %Basic), icIEF is used, as well as, anion 
exchange-high performance liquid chromatography (AEX-HPLC) is also used as supportive orthogonal 
method of icIEF whereas hydrophobic heterogeneities were analysed by reverse phase-ultra 
performance liquid chromatography (RP-UPLC). 
Comparative characterisation of higher order structures included disulfide bond analysis performed by 
LC-ESI-MS, far-UV and near-UV CD characterisation of secondary and tertiary structure, intrinsic 
tryptophan fluorescence (ITF) to evaluate the protein folding, and fourier transform infrared (FTIR) 
spectroscopy as one of the methods for comparative evaluation of the secondary structure. In addition 
differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to determine the heat-induced protein denaturation 
pattern, hydrogen/deuterium exchange with mass spectrometry (H/DX-MS) to determine the 
conformation and conformational dynamics, SEC-MALS in order to determine the molecular weights of 
the monomer and sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation (SV-AUC) employed as a 
method orthogonal to SEC-MALS. Finally, dynamic light scattering (DLS) and micro-flow imaging (MFI) 
were used for particle assessment. 
The results support the applicant`s conclusion that similarity for the relevant physicochemical quality 
attributes has been demonstrated. No significant differences were observed, for the majority of the 
compared quality attributes the data for SB12 were within the pre-established similarity ranges. 
Nevertheless, for certain physicochemical attributes differences were observed discussed below.   
Slight difference of  oxidation and deamidation levels was sufficiently justified to have no impact.  
A slightly different qualitative profile of N-glycans by LC-ESI-MS has been reported. These differences 
were explained by the different expression systems (CHO cells for SB12 whereas Soliris is produced in 
NS0 murine cells). Minor glycan species were varied in SB12 and Soliris but the applicant provide a 
discussion and sufficiently justified that these differences have no impact on efficacy, PK and 
immunogenicity. Reference is made to the EMA guideline EMA/CHMP/BWP/247713/2012 which states 
that “Differences that may confer a safety advantage (e.g. lower levels of impurities) should be 
explained but are unlikely to preclude biosimilarity”. 
In summary, it is not expected that the differences in N-glycan pattern would affect safety and efficacy 
of SB12 in future patient applications; thus, these slight differences can be accepted and do not 
jeopardize the biosimilarity claim. 
Concerning the charged variants by imaged capillary isoelectric focusing, one batch of SB12  had a 
higher %main form than EU and US similarity ranges. Taking into account that this batch is only 
marginally outside the similarity ranges, this outlier is not seen as a concern for the biosimilarity claim.  
Size exclusion chromatography with multi angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) was used to determine 
the molecular weights of the monomer.

Similarity between SB12 and Soliris in terms of biological activity was studied by a C5 inhibition assay 
to measure the inhibitory activity for C5-dependent CDC of SB12 and Soliris and a C5 binding assay 
using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Further assays include an anti-heamolytic 
assay to measure inhibitory effect of SB12 and Soliris on C5-induced heamolysis as well as binding to 
FcRn determined based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR). For binding to FcRn, the results are 
given %Relative Binding Activity, in addition the data for binding kinetics and affinity (e.g. ka, kd KD 
values) derived from the SPR analysis are included.  
Further to the above-mentioned assays, the applicant has investigated a number of additional 
biological properties. The assays used for determination of these attributes are either orthogonal to 
methods used for high-risk attributes or these additional attributes are unlikely to have any impact on 
the clinical behaviour. Thus, these additional biological attributes were classified as low critical and the 
similarity evaluation was conducted with a limited number of batches in a side-by-side manner 
(without any pre-established similarity criteria). These properties included C5 binding additionally 
determined using an orthogonal method SPR, Fcy receptors by SPR, binding to C1q using ELISA and 
binding to C5 polymorphic variants using ELISA. The side-by-side evaluation of these additional, low 
criticality attributes with a limited number of batches can be accepted.  
It is agreed that a broad panel of binding and in-vitro assays have been applied in order to 
demonstrate similarity for biological properties between SB12 and Soliris. Eculizumab has hybrid 
human IgG2-IgG4 heavy-chain constant regions, which have been reported to be unable to activate 
CDC or bind to the Fc-γ receptor of effector cells. Thus, functional activities related to the Fc domain 
such as ADCC, ADCP and CDC have not been evaluated in the biosimilarity exercise, this strategy is 
acceptable.  
Overall, a thorough and extensive biological function description was carried out by the applicant. The 
assays aim mostly on high criticality attributes of SB12 and precisely reflect the mode of action of 
eculizumab. The applicant likewise showed assays for low criticality attributes that are not expected to 
have an influence on safety and efficacy of the molecule. As there are no known Fc effector functions it 
is acceptable to omit ADCC, ADCP and CDC characterisation. A few minor concerns raised during the 
initial assessment have been sufficiently addressed. 
To further support the biosimilarity claim a number of comparative stress stability studies have been 
conducted for Epysqli FP and Soliris. The results demonstrated that the stability profile of Epysqli was 
similar to that of Soliris.  
In addition to the similarity assessment of SB12 versus EU Soliris, comparability of EU Soliris versus 
US Soliris has been investigated. A comparable quality profile between both products was 
demonstrated. 
Overall, a well-established biosimilarity exercise has been conducted, which confirms biosimilarity of 
SB12 with its reference product EU Soliris.  
2.4.3.5.  Adventitious agents 
The microbial and virus testing of MCB and WCB was performed as part of cell bank characterisation, 
results confirmed no contamination and therefore from adventitious safety perspective the MCB is 
considered suitable for routine production. The routine control strategy for unprocessed bulk harvest 
concerning microbial and virus contamination is considered adequate and the results for clinical and 
PPQ batches confirming no contamination were provided Overall, the testing for cell banks and 
unprocessed bulk harvest is considered in compliance with ICH Q5A.  
Assessment report  
EMA/203468/2023  
Page 26/129 
 
 
 
No raw materials of animal origin were used in MCB/WCB generation and routine production. Adequate 
information and supportive documentation for the materials of animal origin were provided and the 
TSE relevant materials are considered compliant with NfG EMA/410/01 rev.3. For the raw material 
used in the SB12 host cell line production a reference to previous (obsolete) version of the TSE CEP  
was provided. This is however considered acceptable, as the raw material was used in the past and the 
certificate of suitability was valid at that time. Related TSE-risk for the final product is considered 
negligible (age of animals, country of origin, category of material, stage in process).  
Virus validation claim is based on the following steps: low pH inactivation, viral filtration (single-use), 
and chromatography steps including protein A affinity. Four relevant model viruses (Table 2) were 
selected for these studies. 
Table 2. Model Virus List for Viral Clearance Studies 
MVM: Minute virus of mice, PRV: pseudorabies virus, Reo-3: reovirus type 3, XMuLV: xenotropic murine leukemia virus 
The scale-down conditions relevant for the virus validation studies are listed and scale-down models for 
chromatography and viral filtration are described in detail including results of performance parameters. 
Resin lifetime evaluation was performed, naive and aged resins were used for virus validation. 
Calculation of the virus particles per dose and estimated safety margin is considered acceptable. 
Retrovirus risk assessment is based on TEM in unprocessed bulk, calculation was provided and is 
considered sufficiently in line with ICH Q5A (R1). Resulting safety margin is acceptable. The respective 
validation report was submitted. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Epysqli was developed as a biosimilar to Soliris. A well-established Module 3 has been provided. The 
AS as well as FP manufacturing with their process controls have been sufficiently described. GMP 
compliance of the manufacturing, testing and storage sites has been confirmed. A Major Objection 
raised concerning the GMP status of the FP manufacturing site has been resolved by provision of a 
valid GMP certificate. 
Process validation has been performed and confirms that both, the AS and FP manufacturing process, 
are capable to produce material which meets its predefined quality requirements. Control of critical 
steps have been clearly presented, an appropriate process control strategy is in place which together 
with the release specifications ensures that only product confirming to predefined quality standards will 
enter the market. Raw and starting materials used in the active substance manufacturing as well as 
the well-known and compendial excipients used for formulation of SB12 have been appropriately 
addressed. The manufacturing history of the AS and FP manufacturing process from pilot to clinical and 
further to the intended commercial process has been presented. To address the changes implemented 
in the process after conduct of the clinical trials a comparability exercise has been performed. This 
evaluation confirmed comparability of clinical with PPQ material. The specifications for AS and FP 
include tests for relevant quality attributes. The container closure systems for AS and FP are 
sufficiently addressed. Finally the stability data have been presented and support the proposed shelf-
life claims for AS and FP. 
An extensive and well-suited biosimilarity exercise has been conducted. A three-way comparison was 
performed between SB12, EU and US Soliris. A broad panel of state-of the art methods has been used 
Assessment report  
EMA/203468/2023  
Page 27/129 
 
 
 
 
to evaluate similarity at quality level; suitability of these methods has been confirmed. In summary 
similarity was demonstrated, a few minor differences in certain attributes (N-glycosylation, oxidation 
and deamidation, and charged variants) were justified to have no impact on efficacy, PK and safety. 
Regarding the differences in N-glycosylation it should be noted that Fc effector functions (which could 
be impacted by different N-glycan profiles) do not play a role in the mode of action of eculizumab. A 
thorough discussion of potential clinical impact on efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), and 
safety/immunogenicity derived from the difference in N- glycans has been provided by the applicant. It 
is concluded that the different N-glycan profiles would not have an impact on efficacy, PK, and 
safety/immunogenicity which can be supported. No atypical N-glycan structures which may raise any 
safety concern were identified. Finally, it is not expected that these differences have any biological 
relevance which was confirmed by a broad panel of binding and in-vitro assays applied in order to 
demonstrate similarity for biological properties between SB12 and Soliris.   
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were two minor unresolved quality issues having no impact on 
the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product, which pertain to the implementation of the working reference 
standard and the submission of the results of the leachable study. These points are put forward and 
agreed as CHMP Recommendations for future quality development. 
In summary, all raised concerns have been solved. No quality issues negatively impacting on the Benefit-
Risk balance have been identified for SB12. Consequently, from a quality perspective the MAA for Epysqli 
is approvable. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
Satisfactory information has been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.4.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
- 
- 
The applicant is recommended to implement the working reference standard until Q2/2023.  
The applicant is recommended to submit the results from the leachable study for the container 
closure system of Epysqli finished product under long-term and accelerated storage conditions  
should be submitted when these data become available.

2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
The pharmacology program was focused on primary PD. A series of in vitro PD studies was performed 
to assess any potential differences in biological activity between SB12 and EU or US Soliris. Given that 
SB12 is developed as a proposed biosimilar, secondary PD, safety pharmacology and PD drug 
interaction studies were not deemed necessary in accordance with EMA guideline 
[EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010]. 
As there were no underlying uncertainties after quality and in vitro studies, in vivo studies were not 
performed, which had been agreed by the EMA SA [EMA/CHMP/SAWP/634958/2017]. Thus, the 
similarity data with respect to pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of SB12 and Soliris in non-clinical animal 
studies are not available. 
Toxicological in vivo studies were not performed. Animal studies are less sensitive to detect differences 
between biosimilar and reference products and species differences between animals and humans limit 
the suitability of this approach to evaluate biosimilarity [Van Aerts et al., 2014]. Thus, no in vivo 
animal studies for SB12 were conducted which was agreed by the European Medicine Agency (EMA) 
[EMA/CHMP/SAWP/634958/2017]. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Comparative in vitro studies to evaluate similarity between SB12 and EU/US Soliris with regard to 
biological properties were conducted and generally showed similar biological properties between both 
products. Additional biological properties of SB12 (e.g. C5 binding by SPR (surface plasmon 
resonance), Fcγ receptors , C1q binding, C5 polymorphic variants binding) were also compared to 
EU/US Soliris in side-by-side analyses. Study reports of those studies were submitted in Module 3 of 
the dossier and were thus assessed and discussed in detail in the Quality section of the assessment 
report. Please refer to the Quality AR. 
2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamic studies have been performed.  
2.5.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
No  safety  pharmacology  studies  were  conducted  given  no  residual  uncertainties  in  the  comparative 
analytical  similarity  assessment  (inclusive  of  comprehensive  in  vitro  functional  evaluation,  and 
supplementary comparative ex vivo pharmacology studies).  
2.5.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Pharmacodynamic  interaction  studies  were  not  conducted  given  Soliris  (eculizumab)  has  been 
administered to patients treated concomitantly with a broad range of commonly used medications and 
no safety issues have arisen. 
Assessment report  
EMA/203468/2023  
Page 29/129 
 
 
 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Comparative in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK)/toxicokinetic studies with SB12 and Soliris were not 
conducted and are not required. The lack of these types of studies is justified, and is in line with 
relevant guidelines for biosimilars, on basis that studies in animals for demonstrating biosimilarity are 
generally more insensitive than in vitro studies, and no differences indicating potential effects on PK 
was noted in in vitro binding analyses to FcRn. Moreover, eculizumab is specific to human C5 and does 
not inhibit C5 in species commonly used in nonclinical studies. 
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
Single-dose toxicity studies were not conducted given the lack of a pharmacologically relevant species 
and is also in accordance with the EMA guideline (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010), and the 
recommendations from the EMA [EMA/CHMP/SAWP/634958/2017]. 
2.5.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
No pivotal nor non-pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies have been performed in accordance with the 
EMA guideline (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010), and the recommendations from the EMA 
[EMA/CHMP/SAWP/634958/2017]. 
2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
No in vitro nor in vivo genotoxicity studies have been performed in line with the EMA guideline 
(EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010), and the FDA guidance “Scientific Considerations in Demonstrating 
Biosimilarity to a Reference Product, Guidance for Industry”. 
2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies have been performed in line with the EMA guideline 
(EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010), and the FDA guidance “Scientific Considerations in Demonstrating 
Biosimilarity to a Reference Product, Guidance for Industry”. 
2.5.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
No reproductive and developmental toxicity studies (fertility and early embryonic developmental, 
embryo-fetal development, pre- and postnatal development including maternal functions, offspring 
studies) have been performed, which is in line with the EMA guideline 
(EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010) and the recommendations from the EMA 
[EMA/CHMP/SAWP/634958/2017]. 
2.5.4.6.  Toxicokinetic data 
Not Applicable.  
Assessment report

2.5.4.7.  Local Tolerance

2.5.4.8.  Other toxicity studies 
No other toxicity studies (antigenicity, immunotoxicity, dependence, metabolites, studies on 
impurities) have been performed in line with the EMA guideline (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010) and 
the recommendations from the EMA [EMA/CHMP/SAWP/634958/2017]. 
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The active substance (eculizumab) is a natural substance, the use of which will not alter the 
concentration or distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, SB12 is not expected to 
pose a risk to the environment. The EMA guideline “Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of 
Medicinal Products for Human Use” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2*) makes specific reference to 
certain types of products including proteins (such as SB12), indicating that these products are due to 
their nature unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment. 
2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Study reports of the conducted PD studies were submitted in Module 3 of the dossier and were thus 
assessed and discussed in detail in the Quality section of the assessment report. Please refer to the 
Quality AR.  
Dedicated studies on Secondary pharmacodynamics, Safety pharmacology and PD drug interactions 
were not conducted. This is in line with recent guidance and recommendations. 
In accordance with the EMA’s “Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing 
biotechnology-derived proteins as active substance: non-clinical and clinical issues” 
[EMA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev 01] and FDA’s “Scientific Considerations in Demonstrating 
Biosimilarity to a Reference Product”, independent toxicity studies to evaluate non-clinical safety, 
genotoxicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity, and carcinogenicity were not performed. Animal 
studies are less sensitive to detect differences between biosimilar and reference products and species 
differences between animals and humans limit the suitability of this approach to evaluate biosimilarity 
[Van Aerts et al., 2014]. Thus, not performing in vivo animal studies for SB12 development was 
endorsed by the EMA [EMA/CHMP/SAWP/634958/2017]. 
Furthermore, the non-clinical development program for SB12 is in accordance with the European 
Medicines Agency (EMA) guideline “Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing 
monoclonal antibodies: non-clinical and clinical issues” [EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010] and the US 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance “Scientific Considerations in Demonstrating Biosimilarity 
to a Reference Product, Guidance for Industry”. This development program for SB12 was endorsed by 
the EMA [EMA/CHMP/SAWP/634958/2017]. 
Considering the expected exposure, the nature of the product and the concessions of the current 
guidelines, the absence of studies in the context of a formal environmental risk assessment (ERA) for 
SB12 is considered justified. The active substance is a natural substance, the use of which will not alter 
the concentration or distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, eculizumab is not 
expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacology of SB12 has been investigated in two clinical studies: 
Phase I study (SB12-1001): A randomized, double-blind, three-arm, parallel group, single dose study 
in healthy subjects to demonstrate similarity in PK, safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and PD 
between SB12 and Soliris. 
Phase III study (SB12-3003): A randomized, double-blinded, multicentre study to compare the 
efficacy, safety, PK, and immunogenicity in patients with PNH between SB12 and Soliris.

2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Bioanalytical Method − Pharmacokinetic Assay 
A quantitative assay developed for the determination of SB12 and Soliris in human serum using an 
electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assay of Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) platform was successfully 
validated. In this assay, SB12 is used to prepare standard samples and SB12 or EU/US Soliris is used 
to prepare Quality Control samples. All samples undergo acid dissociation (acetic acid, 300 mM) to 
release any endogenous C5 protein bound with drug (SB12, or EU/US Soliris). Samples are then 
neutralised and incubated with capture solution to allow drug to bind to excess biotinylated C5. After 
incubation with excess biotinylated C5, samples are added to the streptavidin-coated MSD plate, 
following incubation with sulfo-TAG labelled anti-human IgG4-peroxidase antibody. Then, the assay 
produces chemiluminescence signal following the addition of read buffer containing  tripropylamine 
when an electrical voltage is applied. The resulting chemiluminescence is measured in relative light 
units (RLU) using the MESO Quickplex SQ120 plate reader.

Randomisation 
Screening numbers were assigned to subjects sequentially after signing the informed consent form and 
prior to any screening procedure. Each screening number was assigned to only one subject and was 
not re-used. 
Blinding (masking) 
A double-blind technique was used. The IPs were prepared and dispensed by unblinded pharmacists or 
properly trained pharmacy delegate(s). The unblinded pharmacist provided the site staff with ready-to-
use blinded IP infusion solutions, packaged identically in order to maintain the blinding for IP 
administration. The subject, the Investigator, the site staff, the Sponsor, and other study personnel 
who were involved in the treatment or clinical evaluation of subjects were unaware of the treatment 
group assignments. 
Participant flow 
A total of 240 subjects were planned to be randomised. 479 subjects were screened of whom 240 
subjects were randomised. The most common reason for screening failure was failure to meet the 
randomisation criteria. Of the subjects who were randomised, 239 completed the study and 1 subject 
discontinued the study (i.e., EU sourced Soliris treatment group, who withdrew consent for further 
participation on Day 9). None of the subjects discontinued the study due to an AE. 
Conduct of the study 
One non-substantial amendment was made to the original protocol (version 1.0 dated Jun 04, 2018) 
prior to study initiation, to correct minor administrative errors. The study was conducted in accordance 
with the study protocol version 2.0 dated Jul 05, 2018.

Comparison between EU sourced Soliris and US sourced Soliris 
The geometric LSMean ratio (90% CI) for EU sourced Soliris and US sourced Soliris in AUCinf was 0.960 
(0.9216 to 1.0010), which was within the pre-defined equivalence margin of 0.8 to 1.25. 
PK in target population 
Phase III study SB12-3003 
Analysis of Pharmacokinetics in Study SB12-3003 
Eculizumab Ctrough by visit and actual treatment sequence within period for the PKS are presented in 
Table 11-15. The mean (SD) of eculizumab Ctrough versus nominal time plot is presented in Figure 3 
below. 
The PK Analysis Set of Phase III study SB12-3003 included 49 subjects with PHN in total, randomized 
1:1 to receive Soliris or SB12 during Period 1 until Week 26. Hence, 25 subjects received Soliris and 24 
subjects received SB12 during this period. Steady-state concentrations for SB12 and Soliris were 
achieved by Week 4, which is in line with Soliris SmPC using PNH adult dosing regimen. For PK 
assessment in PNH subjects, no equivalence range has been pre-defined, and results are summarized 
descriptively. The mean (SD) eculizumab Ctrough at Week 26 was 150.041 (62.6232) μg/mL in the 
Soliris group and 133.807 (71.6412) μg/mL in the SB12 group. Hence, eculizumab levels appeared 
similar with overlapping SD bars, albeit Ctrough concentrations were consistently lower in the SB12 
group compared to Soliris throughout Period 1. 
At the beginning of Period 2, subjects were switched to receive the respective other treatment. Since 
the issue of a shortage of the comparator (Soliris) led to unplanned IP switch in Period 2 in 8 subjects, 
a total of 16 subjects were included in the actual Soliris treatment sequence during Period 2. Although 
at Week 52 mean (SD) eculizumab Ctrough levels are highly similar between treatment groups [SB12: 
Assessment report  
EMA/203468/2023

129.084 (52.5487) μg/mL, Soliris: 127.102 (60.2749)], the plot showing eculizumab levels over time 
suggests that again SB12 levels appear lower at most time points during Period 2 compared to Soliris. 
Furthermore, 8 subjects with unplanned IP switch (back to SB12) had even lower eculizumab levels, 
compared to mean levels of other study participants receiving either SB12 or Soliris.  
All subjects were ADA negative; hence, no comparison between ADA positive and ADA negative 
subjects was possible.

2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The mode of action of eculizumab has been established. Eculizumab is a humanised monoclonal 
antibody that binds to the human C5 complement protein (C5). C5 is a soluble protein and is central to 
all pathways of complement activation. C5 is cleaved by C5 convertase, producing C5a, which is a 
ligand for the inflammatory receptor C5aR, and C5b, which is a necessary component in the formation 
of the membrane attack complex, which mediates cell lysis. Eculizumab binds to human C5 in the 
region of the protein that becomes C5b, and blocks cleavage, thereby inhibiting the complement 
cascade and ultimately blocking terminal complement mediated intravascular haemolysis in 
paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) patients. 
Bioanalytical Methods − Pharmacodynamic Assay 
A PD assay for measurement of the terminal complement complex in human serum has been set up. A 
commercial ELISA kit (Wieslab Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay from Svar Life Science) was used 
and validated according to the EMA Guideline on bioanalytical method validation,

Study SB12-3003 
Terminal complement activity was assessed as PD marker in Phase III study SB12-3003. The same set 
of subjects was assessed for PK and PD evaluation in this study. The same assay as in Phase I study 
SB12-1001 was used for PD evaluation. The absolute value and percent change from baseline in 
terminal complement activities are presented in the Table below. The mean (SD) of absolute value and 
percentage change from baseline in terminal complement activities versus nominal time plot are 
presented in Figure 7 and Figure 8. 
At Week 26 (end of Period 1), before IP switch, the mean (SD) change from baseline of terminal 
complement activity was -84.23 (11.970) % in the Soliris group and -80.06 (14.534) % in the SB12 
group. At Week 52 mean (SD) change from baseline of terminal complement activity was -84.68 
(15.066) % in the actual SB12 treatment group and -86.51 (11.766) % among the 14 subjects who 
received Soliris during Period 2 and were included in PD assessment. The 8 subjects with unplanned IP 
switch (back to SB12) during Period 2 had a lower mean (SD) reduction of terminal complement 
activity [-76.08 (21.998) %] compared to other subjects receiving either SB12 or Soliris. 
No ADA were reported throughout the study, hence no possible impact of ADA on terminal complement 
activity could be assessed.

2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacology of SB12 has been investigated in two clinical studies, the Phase I study SB12-1001 
and the Phase III study SB12-3003. 
The Phase I study SB12-1001 is the pivotal study investigating PK similarity. The study was a 
randomized, double-blind, three-arm, parallel group, single dose study in healthy subjects to 
demonstrate similarity in PK, safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and PD between SB12 and Soliris. 
Due to the long half-life of the product, the parallel design is considered appropriate. The study 
consisted of the screening and the treatment period. Subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to 
receive either SB12, EU-sourced Soliris or US-sourced Soliris. The total study duration was 
approximately 92 days (including the 28-day Screening period). The study was conducted at a single 
centre in Berlin, Germany. Overall, the design of the Phase I study SB12-1001 is acceptable and is 
generally in agreement with previous Scientific Advice (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/634958/2017). A parallel 
study design was chosen due to the long half-life of eculizumab (mean 11.3 days in PNH patients), 
which is appropriate. Specific design aspects that were not followed or were not conducted as initially 
planned, will be discussed below. 
The study started on 13-Nov-2018 with the first subject signing informed consent and was completed 
on 08-Apr-2019 with the last subject last visit. The database lock was on 10-Jul-2019. No concerns 
arise from the provided dates. The protocol of the study was amended once in order to correct minor 
administrative errors. The amendment happened prior to initiation of the study and the applicant 
provided both protocol versions. 
The main inclusion criteria for the Phase I study were age between 18-55 years, body weight between 
70.0 and 95.0 kg and BMI between 20.0 and 29.9 kg/m2. This is appropriate. The applicant performed 
its Phase I PK study SB12-1001 in healthy male and female volunteers. It would have been preferable 
to conduct the study only in male subjects, as this would have been considered a more homogenous 
and sensitive model to demonstrate, or exclude, differences between the treatment arms, if existent. 
This was also an issue in a previous EMA Scientific Advice (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/634958/2017). Initially, 
the applicant proposed to include only healthy male subjects to the study and this was regarded 
acceptable by the CHMP. However, it seems that the applicant changed the inclusion criteria after this 
advice, as the study was open for male as well as female subjects. Further discussion on implications 
of this issue on PK similarity will be provided further below when the PK results of the study are 
discussed. Furthermore, and as was also discussed in the initial Scientific Advice 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/634958/2017), an ethnically homogenous study population would have been 
preferable as a more homogeneous model to study PK differences in this parallel study design. In the 
initial Scientific Advice, the applicant proposed stratified randomization by ethnicity to ensure 
comparable study groups. However, this did not seem to have been implemented in the planning of the 
study, as it was not defined in the protocol nor in the SAP. Further discussion on implications of this 
issue on PK similarity are provided below when discussing the PK results of the study are discussed. 
Overall, apart from the aspects discussed above, the main in- and exclusion criteria are acceptable. 
SB12, EU sourced Soliris, and US sourced Soliris were administered by IV infusion at day 1. The 
applicant chose a dose of 300 mg eculizumab for the Phase I study in healthy volunteers. This is the 
lowest therapeutic dose of Soliris used for aHUS patients. The dose is considered sensitive to detect 
differences between the treatment arms and is therefore considered appropriate. 
The primary objective of this study was the demonstration of PK similarity of SB12 to the EU- and US-
sourced reference products Soliris. The secondary objectives included further PK characteristics and to 
assess the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and PD aspects of SB12 and the reference products. 
This is overall endorsed. The primary PK endpoint of the study was AUCinf. The secondary PK endpoints 
Assessment report  
EMA/203468/2023  
Page 49/129 
 
 
 
comprised AUClast, Cmax, Tmax, Vz, lambda_z, t1/2, CL and %AUCextrap. The primary and secondary PK 
endpoints are in line with the “Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing monoclonal 
antibodies – non-clinical and clinical issues (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010)” and are therefore 
endorsed. 
The measurement of free eculizumab concentrations could have provided additive data in support for 
the demonstration of biosimilarity. However, for the evaluation of PK, the applicant only measured 
total eculizumab. Although this is not regarded optimal, a request at this point in time would not be 
regarded fruitful. Therefore, no concern is raised. 
The PK assay has been sufficiently described and validated and is considered suitable for its use. 
The secondary PD endpoint was defined as the “Change in terminal complement activity over time”. 
The used PD assay combines principles of the haemolytic assay for complement activation with the use 
of alkaline phosphatase (APh)-conjugated antibodies specific for the neoantigen produced as a result of 
complement activation. The assay principle has been appropriately described and the results generated 
from the validation work confirm that this assay is robust and suitable for measurement of terminal 
complement complex in human serum. A validation summary as well as the detailed validation results 
have been provided; certain deviations, which occurred during the validation study, were documented 
and sufficiently justified to have no impact on the validity of the study. It was also verified that the 
same method used in the clinical Phase I study (healthy subject) can be employed for sample analysis 
to determine terminal complement activities in PNH patients in Study SB12-3003. 
However, in the Scientific Advice EMA/CHMP/SAWP/634958/2017, provided to the applicant in October 
2017, it was recommended to include CH50 at least as a key secondary endpoint for the confirmatory 
phase III trial as recent literature indicates that CH50 activity might be a more specific and predictive 
PD marker for clinical efficacy and pharmacological action of eculizumab. A justification why the 
applicant has not included the recommended functional haemolytic CH50 assay was requested. The 
applicant provided a justification for using the terminal complement activity ELISA. This included a 
rationale for the selection, a correlation between functional haemolytic assay and terminal complement 
activity ELISA and a correlation of terminal complement activity ELISA and lactate dehydrogenase. The 
applicant states that there were problems with the validation of the functional haemolytic assay. 
Although validation feasibility and technical issues are rather regarded as weak arguments, the 
described limitations can be understood. In addition, the applicant provided literature references 
showing correlation between terminal complement activity ELISA and functional haemolytic CH50 
assay both in healthy subjects and patients. This is acceptable. Furthermore, the applicant provided in 
house data showing that the terminal complement activity ELISA might be more sensitive than the 
haemolytic assay and that there is reasonable correlation between the two assays. Although it is 
agreed that the results show a greater sensitivity for the terminal complement activity ELISA and there 
might be a correlation between the two assays, these results have to be interpreted carefully due to 
the above described lack of validation of the haemolytic assay. Analysis of correlation between lactate 
dehydrogenase and terminal complement activities with samples from Study SB12-3003 also showed 
good correlation between LDH and terminal complement activity. This is accepted. 
The secondary safety endpoints included adverse events and serious adverse events, clinically 
laboratory values, 12-lead ECG, vital signs and physical examinations. This is acceptable. The 
secondary immunogenicity endpoints were defined as the “Incidence of anti-drug antibodies to 
eculizumab” and “Incidence of neutralising antibodies to eculizumab”. This is acknowledged. Apart 
from non-inclusion of the PD endpoint CH50 (as discussed above), the secondary endpoints are 
considered acceptable. In addition, the PK sampling time points (collected at 0, 0.58, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 
96, 168, 240, 336, 504, 672, 840, 1008, 1176, 1344, and 1512 hours after the start of infusion) are 
deemed acceptable to reflect the characteristics of eculizumab and to gain respective data for a 
Assessment report  
EMA/203468/2023  
Page 50/129 
 
 
 
comparative evaluation of the critical PK parameters of SB12 and the reference products. The 
immunogenicity sampling time points (collected at 0, 336, 672, and 1512 hours after the start of 
infusion) are also appropriate. 
Subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the three treatments groups. The process of 
randomization was adequately described and is considered acceptable. The Phase I study SB12-1001 
was a subject-, investigator- and sponsor-blinded study. The pharmacists who prepared and dispensed 
the IPs were unblinded. The process of blinding was adequately described and is considered 
acceptable. 
The PK parameters were calculated based on actual sampling times and non-compartmental analysis 
methods using Phoenix WinNonlin version 8.0. This is considered acceptable. 
Of the 479 screened subjects, 239 were screening failures due to not meeting the randomization 
criteria, withdrawal by subject or others. For a study conducted in healthy volunteers, the high number 
of screen failures is remarkable. However, the applicant has provided a detailed listing with the 
reasons for screen failures. No concerns arise from these data. Of the 240 randomized subjects, 239 
completed the study. One subject in the EU-sourced Soliris group withdrew before completion due to 
personal reasons on day 9. 
The number of subjects with any protocol deviation was similar between the groups. 55 % of the 
subjects in the SB12 group, 57.5 % of the subjects in the EU-sourced Soliris group and 57.5 % of the 
subjects in the US-sourced Soliris group had a protocol deviation. All of the protocol deviations were 
minor and none of the subjects had a major protocol deviation. The reasons for protocol deviation 
included deviations from concomitant medication criteria and study procedure criteria and were well 
balanced among the groups. 
The participant flow is described in sufficient detail and is comprehensible. Furthermore, all of the 
protocol deviations were minor and do not seem to influence the biosimilarity assessment of SB12 and 
the reference products. Thus, no concerns arise. 
The baseline characteristics were well balanced among the SB12, EU-sourced Soliris and US-sourced 
Soliris groups. The mean age was 39.6, 40.9 and 40.2 years, respectively. Most of the subjects in the 
study were male, with 95.8% of the subjects being male and 4.2% of the subjects being female. The 
majority of the subjects in the study were White (95.8%) and “Not Hispanic or Latino” (98.3%). 
Gender, race and ethnicity aspects were well balanced among the groups. In addition, the height, 
weight and BMI of the subjects was comparable among the groups. This is regarded acceptable. 
Furthermore, the fact that the majority of subjects were “male”, “White” and “Not Hispanic or Latino”, 
puts into perspective the homogeneity issue of the population, that was discussed above in relation to 
the deviation from the initial Scientific Advice (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/634958/2017). Although the study 
would have been open for both male and female subjects and an ethnically diverse population, the 
demographic data show that a very homogenous population was actually recruited, that is considered 
sensitive enough to elucidate differences between SB12 and the reference products, if existent. Thus, 
no concerns arise from these issues. 
The number of subjects randomized to the study was 240 (80 per treatment group). All subjects were 
included in the randomized set, the safety set and the PK Analysis Set. For the one subject who 
discontinued the study on day 9, the PK parameters AUCinf, AUClast, Vz, t1/2, λz, CL, and %AUCextrap were 
excluded from the PK summary statistics and primary PK analysis. This is regarded acceptable. The 
numbers analysed were well presented by the applicant and are considered appropriate. 
Assessment report

The applicant provided the mean serum concentration time-profiles. The profiles were comparable 
among the SB12, EU-sourced Soliris and US-sourced Soliris groups. The applicant also provided the 
individual serum concentrations time-profiles for each subject. This is endorsed. 
The summary statistics of the PK parameters revealed that most of the PK parameters, such as AUCinf, 
AUClast, Cmax, Vz, CL and t1/2 were similar among the three treatment groups. However, the median Tmax 
was quite different among the treatment groups. For the SB12 group, median Tmax was 0.708 h, for 
the EU-sourced Soliris group median Tmax was 3.967 h and for the US-sourced Soliris group, median 
Tmax was 2.317 h. The applicant was asked to provide an explanation for the apparently different Tmax 
results among the treatment groups. The applicant has provided the requested mean and SD statistics 
for Tmax. The mean values for Tmax are similar among treatment groups and the SD is high. In addition, 
the applicant has provided a possible explanation for the different median Tmax levels among the 
groups, which might be due to a higher number of subjects in the EU and US Soliris groups with an 
exceptionally high Tmax value. Excluding these subjects from the analyses leads to similar median Tmax 
values among the groups. Although it is not entirely clear why there are more subjects with an 
exceptionally high Tmax in the EU and US Soliris groups, the issue is not further pursued due to the 
similar mean Tmax among the groups and the fact that the median Tmax for SB12 described in this study 
is similar to what had been observed for Soliris in a similar designed study. 
The point estimate of the ratio (SB12/EU-sourced Soliris) of the geometric LS means for AUCinf was 
0.991 with the corresponding 90% CI being (0.9541; 1.0285). The point estimate of the ratio 
(SB12/US-sourced Soliris) of the geometric LS means for AUCinf was 0.951 with the corresponding 
90% CI being (0.9140; 0.9904). The point estimate of the ratio (EU-sourced Soliris /US-sourced 
Soliris) of the geometric LS means for AUCinf was 0.960 with the corresponding 90% CI being (0.9216; 
1.0010). Thus, the primary endpoint of the Phase I study SB12-1001 was met, as the ratio of the 
geometric LSMeans was within the pre-defined acceptance criteria of 0.8 to 1.25. 
The primary endpoint analyses were supported by analyses on AUCinf in post-dose ADA negative 
subjects, which led to similar conclusions as the primary analyses. Due to the low number of ADA 
positive subjects in the study (3 subjects in total), analyses on AUCinf in post-dose ADA positive 
subjects was not performed. This can be followed. 
Phase III study SB12-3003 was a randomized, double-blinded, multicentre, cross-over study to 
compare the efficacy, safety, PK, and immunogenicity in patients with PNH between SB12 and Soliris. 
For PK assessment in the target population of PNH subjects, no equivalence range has been pre-
defined, and results were summarised descriptively due to the limited number of subjects enrolled. 
This is acceptable, provided that robust PK results from Phase I study in healthy volunteers are able to 
demonstrate biosimilarity between SB12 and Soliris.  
In Phase III study SB12-3003 Ctrough levels were assessed in 23 subjects in both treatment groups at 
Week 26 (Period 1), which was also the timepoint of the primary assessment and before subjects were 
switched to the other treatment (cross-over design). The mean (SD) eculizumab Ctrough at Week 26 
was 150.041 (62.6232) μg/mL in the Soliris group and 133.807 (71.6412) μg/mL in the SB12 group. 
Hence, eculizumab levels appeared similar between treatment groups with overlapping SD bars. After 
the planned IP switch in Period 2, the issue of a shortage of the comparator (Soliris) led to unplanned 
IP switch in Period 2 in 8 subjects, resulting in Ctrough level evaluation of 14 patients at Week 52 (of 22 
included in PK assessment at Week 52). Of those, mean (SD) eculizumab Ctrough levels were highly 
similar between treatment groups [SB12 (n=21): 129.084 (52.5487) μg/mL, Soliris (n=14): 127.102 
(60.2749)]. Due to the low number of subjects, high variability and unplanned IP switch, the data are 
limited, but can be considered supportive for PK equivalence of SB12 and Soliris as demonstrated in 
Phase I study SB12-1001. 
Assessment report  
EMA/203468/2023  
Page 52/129 
 
 
 
Nevertheless, Ctrough concentrations were consistently lower in the SB12 group compared to Soliris 
throughout the study. By far the lowest Ctrough concentrations were observed in the subgroup of 
patients with unplanned IP switch (back to SB12) during Period 2 (n=8). Upon request, the applicant 
provided an overview of the actual treatment by timepoint during period 2 for the 8 patients with the 
unplanned IP switch, which showed that during period 2, SB12 and Soliris was administered at 
approximately half of the timepoints, respectively. Thus, it is agreed that it cannot be generally 
concluded that SB12 treatment leads to lower PK levels in the IP switched patients. In addition, the 
applicant provided the requested plot of mean eculizumab Cthrough levels for period 1 of the same 8 
patients, which clearly shows that the unplanned IP switch sequence is generally lower than the other 
treatment sequences, independent of actual treatment. Thus, it is agreed that lower levels might be 
rather due to individual disposition than the product itself. Further analyses of confounding factors 
revealed that the 8 patients with the unplanned IP switch had similar demographic and baseline 
characteristics as the remaining 41 patients without IP switch. One striking difference that was not 
discussed by the applicant is the higher percentage of males in the IP switch group (87.5% in the IP 
switch group versus 48.8% in the other group). This might to a certain extent explain the lower 
exposure in this group, as further PK/PD analysis identified body weight as a statistically significant 
covariate on clearance. The unplanned IP switch subjects have a slightly higher body weight. Indeed, 
there seems to be also a higher clearance in the unplanned IP switch subjects, which might explain the 
lower PK observed in these subjects. This is acceptable. 
In the Phase I study SB12-1001, the “Change in terminal complement activity over time” was 
evaluated as a secondary pharmacodynamics endpoint. The sampling time points for this evaluation 
(at 0, 0.58, 4, 24, 48, 96, 168, 240, 336, and 1512 hours after the start of infusion) are considered 
appropriate. The profiles for mean complement activity among SB12, EU-sourced Soliris and US-
sourced Soliris group were similar. The same holds true for the profiles of the change from baseline in 
terminal complement activity. These results can be considered as supportive PD results. 
Evaluation of terminal complement activity as PD marker in Phase III study SB12-3003 confirmed the 
trends observed in the PK analysis in PNH patients. The mean reduction of terminal complement 
activity was lower in the SB12 group (-80.06%) compared to Soliris (-84.23%) at Week 26 and similar 
trends were observed throughout the study.  
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the design of the Phase I study SB12-1001 was appropriate and mostly in line with previous 
Scientific Advice (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/634958/2017). The primary endpoints were met and the applicant 
could demonstrate comparable PK among the SB12, EU-sourced Soliris and US-sourced Soliris group. 
In addition, pharmacokinetic analysis in target population of PNH patients was performed by evaluating 
Ctrough levels in the Phase III study SB12-3003, but no acceptance criteria to demonstrate biosimilarity 
regarding PK were pre-defined in this study. 
The evaluation of terminal complement activity in the Phase I and Phase III study can be considered as 
supportive PD results. Overall, the available PK/PD data from pivotal PK Phase I study SB12-1001 
support biosimilarity versus the EU reference product and also versus the US reference product. 
Supportive PK/PD data is provided from Phase III study SB12-3003.

2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
In order to demonstrate similarity in efficacy between SB12, and Soliris, a randomized, double-blind, 
multicentre, comparative clinical Phase III study (SB12-3003) in patients with PNH was conducted. 
The clinical Phase III study (SB12-3003) is not aimed to demonstrate efficacy per se, but to confirm 
clinical equivalence between SB12 and Soliris in a representative indication evaluating the efficacy, 
safety, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity. 
In view of obvious shortcomings of Study SB12-3003, related to a limited sample size (n=25 per study 
arm), and short period for safety evaluation (26 weeks before IP switch), the importance of the Phase 
I PK study in providing supporting evidence for the overall comparability exercise was emphasised. 
Therefore, assessment of clinical biosimilarity of SB12 and Soliris will be based mostly on PK/PD results 
of Phase I study (SB12-1001), and confirmatory clinical efficacy and safety results from Phase III 
study SB12-3003. 
2.6.5.1.  Dose response study 
No dose response studies were performed and are not deemed necessary in the biosimilarity setting. 
2.6.5.2.  Main study 
SB12-3003 randomised, Phase III, double-blind, multicentre, cross-over 
study to compare the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and 
immunogenicity between SB12 and Soliris in subjects with PNH 
Methods 
The study design is provided in the Figure 9 below. 
Figure 9: Graphical study design (study SB12-3003) 
For Study SB12-3003, eligible patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to treatment sequence I (SB12 
to Soliris) or treatment sequence II (Soliris to SB12). Patients randomly assigned to treatment with 
SB12 or Soliris received 600 mg of eculizumab IV every 7 ± 2 days for first 4 weeks (initial phase) and 
900 mg for the fifth dose (Week 4) 7 ± 2 day later, then 900 mg every 14 ± 2 days thereafter. 
Patients who were randomized to initially receive SB12 were switched to receive Soliris and patients 
who were randomized to initially receive Soliris were switched to receive SB12 at Week 26. SB12 or 
Soliris was given until Week 50.

Prior and Concomitant Medications 
The following concomitant medications were allowed if given on a stable dose (only for chronic 
administration) during the study period. However, for the subject’s welfare, medications could be 
adjusted after discussion between the Investigator and medical monitor and/or Sponsor. 
•  Erythropoietin, systemic corticosteroids, low-molecular-weight heparins, iron supplements, and 
androgen therapy with a stable dose from at least 4 weeks prior to initiation of study drug 
(Day 1). 
•  Warfarin with a stable INR from at least 4 weeks prior to initiation of study drug (Day 1). 
•  Cyclosporine with a stable dose from at least 8 weeks prior to initiation of study drug (Day 1). 
Immunosuppressant except for cyclosporine was prohibited during the study period from 
randomisation including but not limited to: 
•  Anti-thymocyte globulin, cyclophosphamide, etc. 
Subjects who initiated SB12 or Soliris treatment less than 14 days after receiving meningococcal 
vaccine must have received treatment with appropriate prophylactic antibiotics until 14 days after 
vaccination. 
The subjects received pRBCs transfusion if the Investigator discovered that a subject’s haemoglobin 
warranted a transfusion: 
•  Haemoglobin value ≤ 9 g/dL with signs or symptoms, or 
•  Haemoglobin value ≤ 7 g/dL regardless of signs or symptoms 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria, as well as haematological parameter limits at screening, were largely 
in line with registrational studies for Soliris in PNH (TRIUMPH and SHEPHERD), and are therefore 
acceptable. Although patients were not evaluated regarding hereditary complement deficiency before 
inclusion in study, lack of efficacy due to certain C5 genetic variants is listed among the criteria for IP 
Discontinuation. 
•  Treatments 
Test product: SB12 (eculizumab, proposed biosimilar to Soliris) 
Reference product: Soliris  
SB12 or Soliris was administered intravenously up to Week 50 (a total of 28 administrations of IP) 
unless they were early discontinued from study treatment. Dosing and treatment schedules were to be 
kept as follows: 
•  600 mg every 7 ± 2 days for the first 4 weeks, followed by 
Assessment report  
EMA/203468/2023  
Page 56/129 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  900 mg for the fifth dose (Week 4) 7 ± 2 days later, then 
•  900 mg every 14 ± 2 days thereafter 
The treatment schedule was dependent on the previous treatment date rather than the absolute (i.e., 
fixed) number of days from Day 1. In other words, the next 7 ± 2 days or 14 ± 2 days treatment 
schedule described above was re-scheduled every time based on the date when the previous treatment 
was given. 
The subject who received SB12 or Soliris treatment would require dosing interval adjustment within 
the recommended 14 ± 2 days dosing schedule during the maintenance period (up to every 12 days) 
when it was deemed necessary at the discretion of the Investigator, e.g. two consecutive events of 
elevated LDH ≥ 2 × ULN combined with sign or symptom of intravascular haemolysis after prior LDH 
reduction to < 1.5 × ULN on treatment. If a 12- or 13-day dosing interval conflicted with 
administrative schedules (e.g., holidays or weekends) but a shortened dosing interval was considered 
necessary for safety of subject, consultation with medical monitor (or Sponsor) was recommended. For 
subjects whose dosing interval was adjusted to 12 days in Period 1, it was recommended that the 
dosing interval be switched back to 14 days after switching IP at Week 26. Once the above event had 
occurred, the Investigator informed the medical monitor and/or Sponsor immediately. 
In special circumstances of a shortage of the comparator, to ensure continuity of study treatment for 
the duration of study, the Sponsor provided SB12 instead of Soliris in a blinded manner. Rules for 
allocation of remaining comparators during the comparator shortage situation were pre-specified prior 
to execution of the potential change of IP assignment from Soliris to SB12 in a blinded manner. This 
was to avoid the risk of unblinding and potential bias. 
In circumstances of SB12 instead of Soliris was given in Period 2, the data were summarised as follows 
presented by actual treatment sequence within each period: 
• 
Period 1 data were summarised by treatment sequences from Period 1 (i.e., actual treatment 
sequence ‘Soliris to SB12’ and ‘SB12 to All’). Where, treatment sequence ‘SB12 to All’ included 
subjects from sequences SB12 to Soliris and Unplanned IP Switch. 
•  Similarly, Period 2 data were summarised by actual treatment sequence namely ‘Soliris to 
SB12’, ‘SB12 to All’, ‘SB12 to Soliris’ and ‘Unplanned IP switch.’ Where, treatment sequence 
‘SB12 to All’ included subjects from sequences SB12 to Soliris and Unplanned IP Switch. 
Criteria for IP Discontinuation 
The study treatment was discontinued for a subject in the event of the following: 
•  Consent withdrawal by subject 
• 
Pregnancy (study treatment was immediately stopped when a pregnancy was made known and 
the pregnant woman was removed from the study) 
•  Unblinding the study treatment to the Investigator or subject (i.e., breaking the double-blind) 
•  Other complement inhibitor use 
The Investigator discussed with the medical monitor prior to discontinuing a subject’s study treatment 
in case of the following criteria, but not limited to: 
•  Conditions or intercurrent illness that preclude compliance with the study protocol in terms of 
their safety or well-being 
• 
Lack of efficacy (e.g., C5 gene polymorphism) 
Assessment report  
EMA/203468/2023  
Page 57/129 
 
 
 
•  Unacceptable toxicity including meningococcal infection or anaphylaxis 
•  Serious protocol deviations (PDs) including lack of subject’s compliance (e.g., repeated delay in 
study treatment and lost to follow-up) that preclude continuation of the study 
• 
Investigator discretion or other reasons 
Subjects who discontinued from the study at any time post-Day 1 (after the initiation of study drug) 
before completion of last study treatment at Week 50 was required to have an ET visit. The data were 
collected at the 8 weeks after the last dose of study drug according to Section Reporting Serious 
Adverse Events of study protocol (V 6.0). When a subject withdrew from the study due to a serious 
adverse event (SAE), the SAE had to be reported and followed in accordance with the requirements 
outlined in Section Reporting Serious Adverse Events of study protocol (V 6.0). 
Route of administration, dosing and schedule are in line with the posology of Soliris for the treatment 
of PNH.

The equivalence margin was [−1.2 × ULN, 1.2 × ULN] for the comparison with the 95% CI of the 
mean difference in LDH at Week 26 where ULN of LDH to be specified in the central laboratory 
specification for this study. For sample size calculation, [−268 U/L, 268 U/L] was chosen to be 23 
subjects per treatment sequence with the assumptions of no mean difference and common SD of 270 
U/L at the overall 5% significance level. Assuming a 5% loss from randomised subjects after 26 weeks, 
a sample size of 25 subjects per treatment sequence (overall sample size of 50) was given 23

completers per treatment sequence after 26 weeks, which was estimated to give 80% power to detect 
the equivalence within the margin of 268 U/L. 
•  Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
Randomization 
Subjects who met all criteria for enrolment were randomly assigned to treatment sequence I (SB12 to 
Soliris) or II (Soliris to SB12). The randomisation numbers were generated by the interactive web 
response system (IWRS) to ensure that treatment sequence assignment was unbiased and concealed 
from subjects, Investigators, and other study personnel. These randomisation numbers were linked to 
each treatment sequence, which in turn were linked to IP kit numbers. 
Subjects were not stratified, and the assigned randomisation numbers were not re-used. 
Subjects who were screen failed due to technical issues, not medical issues, were re-screened once 
based on discussion and agreement between the Investigator and the medical monitor and/or Sponsor. 
Blinding (masking) 
This study was double-blinded. Subjects, Investigators, and other study personnel remained blinded to 
the treatment sequence assignment throughout the study period after randomisation. 
To ensure the blinding for the treatment sequence assignment, one carton contained only one IP vial 
(SB12 or Soliris). The carton and IP vial were packed and labelled in identical appearance. These IP 
vials were packed and labelled in a double-blinded manner for clinical use. 
The Investigator and/or designee took responsibility for all steps to maintain appropriate records and 
ensured appropriate supply, storage, handling, distribution, and usage of IPs in accordance with the 
study protocol and any applicable laws and regulations. A detailed guidance for IP preparation, 
administration, storage, and destruction were provided in the pharmacy manual. 
Emergency unblinding was considered only when knowledge of the treatment assignment is deemed 
essential for the subject’s safety by their Investigator or a regulatory body. The IWRS was be used to 
break the blind and details on how to do this were provided in the IWRS manual. 
•  Statistical methods 
Analysis Sets 
•  Enrolled Set (ENR): The ENR consists of all subjects who provide informed consent for the 
study. 
•  Randomized Set (RAN): The RAN consists of all subjects who have received a randomisation 
number 
•  Modified Full Analysis Set (M-FAS): The M-FAS consists of all RAN subjects who do not have 
positive result of pharmacogenetic analysis (C5 gene polymorphism). However, subjects who 
do not have any efficacy assessment result after randomisation and do not receive 
investigational product (IP) during the study period will be excluded from this analysis set. 
Following the intent-to-treat principle, subjects will be analysed according to the treatment 
sequence they are assigned to at randomisation.

Per-Protocol Set for AUEC of LDH (PPS-AUEC): The PPS-AUEC consist of all M-FAS subjects 
who have sufficient LDH assessments for AUEC calculation without any major protocol 
deviations that have impact on efficacy assessment. Subjects excluded from the primary 
analysis will be predefined on a case-by-case basis prior to unblinding the treatment sequence 
assignment for analyses. In addition, subjects who received different treatment from the 
randomization treatment sequence due to a shortage of the comparator will be excluded from 
this analysis set. 
In addition to the case-by case basis review of protocol deviations and individual LDH profile 
prior to unblinding the treatment sequence assignment, subjects who met the following 
criteria were excluded from the PPS-AUEC: 
1.  Missing LDH assessment results at week 14, 26, 40 or 52 
2.  Missing LDH assessment results at more than 2 timepoints (>= 3 missing LDH values) 
from week 14 to week 26 or from week 40 to week 52 
• 
Per-Protocol Set for LDH at a single time point (PPS-single): The PPS-single consists of all M-
FAS subjects who have LDH assessment at week 26 without any major protocol deviations 
that have impact on efficacy assessment. Subjects excluded from the primary analysis were 
predefined on a case-by-case basis prior to unblinding the treatment sequence assignment for 
analyses. In addition, subjects who received different treatment in period 1 from the 
randomized treatment sequence due to a shortage of the comparator will be excluded from 
this analysis set. 
Multiplicity 
No formal adjustment of Type I error rates was performed 
Primary efficacy analysis 
For EMA, Korea MFDS, or other regulatory agency submissions for those who were in favour of the LDH 
level at a single time point, the primary efficacy analysis was performed for the PPS-single using a 
linear model with treatment, and gender as a fixed-effect. The analysis was performed with loge 
transformed LDH at Week 26 estimating the difference in least squares means (LSM) and its 95% 
confidence interval (CI), and the delta method was used to provide the mean difference and 95% CI in 
original scale. The equivalence was declared if the two-sided 95% CI of the mean difference in LDH 
level at Week 26 between SB12 and Soliris lied within the pre-defined equivalence margin of [−1.2 × 
ULN, 1.2 × ULN] = [−337.2, 337.2], where ULN = 281 U/L. Since the normal range of LDH is gender 
specific, the smallest ULN = 281 U/L was used for the equivalence margin. 
For the US FDA or other regulatory agency submissions for those who were in favour of the time-
adjusted AUEC of LDH, the primary endpoint of time-adjusted AUEC of LDH from Week 14 to Week 26 
and time-adjusted AUEC of LDH from Week 40 to Week 52 were analysed for the PPSAUEC using a 
linear mixed model with treatment, sequence, period, and gender as fixed effects, and subject nested 
within sequence as a random effect. The analysis was performed with loge-transformed time-adjusted 
AUEC of LDH estimating the difference in LSM and its 90% CI, and back transformation of those values 
provided the ratio of GMs and 90% CI. The equivalence was declared if the two-sided 90% CI of the 
ratio of GMs in time-adjusted AUEC of LDH between SB12 and Soliris lied within the pre-defined 
equivalence margin of [0.77, 1.29]. 
For sensitivity analysis, the primary efficacy analysis was repeated for the M-FAS. Missing data was 
imputed using multiple imputation method for cases of insufficient values for AUEC calculation or 
discontinued subjects before Week 26 or Week 52. 
Assessment report  
EMA/203468/2023  
Page 61/129 
 
 
 
 
 
Complete case analysis 
Complete case analysis based on the M-FAS was performed for both the endpoint of LDH at Week 26 
and time-adjusted AUEC of LDH, where time-adjusted AUEC calculation is based on complete LDH 
data, without imputation on missing LDH data. Complete case for an endpoint of single LDH level at 
Week 26 was defined as subjects with non-missing LDH values at Week 26. Similarly, complete case 
for an endpoint of time adjusted AUEC was the subjects with sufficient data to calculate AUEC (non-
missing LDH values more than 1) in at least one period. 
Multiple Imputation that assumes missing at random (MAR) 
Missing LDH data was imputed for subjects who dropped out of the study prior to the primary analysis 
time point. Missing LDH data was imputed by fully conditional specification (FCS), which is the 
sequential regression algorithm, multiple imputation method utilising the non-missing LDH data at 
previous visits and planned treatment sequence, gender as categorical covariates. This imputation 
model used baseline LDH values as a covariate in imputing values of LDH for subsequent visits. In case 
of sensitivity analysis of LDH at Week 26, results of linear model based on loge transformed LDH 
values were combined first using Rubin’s rule and then delta method was used later to report mean 
difference and 95% CI in original scale. 
Secondary efficacy analysis 
As a secondary efficacy endpoint, the number of units of pRBCs transfused was summarized 
descriptively by planned treatment sequence and planned treatment sequence within period. 
Comparison between treatment sequences in the number of units of pRBCs transfused was analysed 
using Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Combined individual and mean LDH profile were presented over time by 
planned treatment sequence.

Republic of Korea, 5 centres in Malaysia, 1 centre in Mexico, 4 centres in Romania, 3 centres in 
Taiwan, 2 centres in Thailand, and 4 centres in Ukraine. 
•  Conduct of the study 
There were five global amendments to the original protocol (Version 1.0, dated Jul 31, 2018). Three 
global amendments were incorporated during the recruitment period (Aug 07, 2019 – Oct 21, 2021). A 
detailed change history of all global amendments was provided, and changes made to facilitate 
recruitment, clarify several study procedures and to address issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic.  
Global Protocol Amendment 4 (Version 5.0, Aug 21, 2020) included an update on study design in order 
to minimise the risk of COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in the removal of a 2 year extension 
period to assess the long-term safety.  
Global Protocol Amendment 5 (Version 6.0, Nov 27, 2020) included an update in order to address the 
shortage of comparator, which lasted from Nov 2020 to Mar 2021. This resulted in an unplanned IP 
switch from Soliris to SB12 in Period 2 for some subjects, who remained on SB12 treatment until study

end, even after the shortage was resolved by providing US-Soliris (Mar 2021) to avoid frequent IP 
changes. Of the 8 subjects with unplanned IP switch, 5 patients had already received Soliris as planned 
after transition to Period 2 and were switched back to SB12. Two of the 8 subjects with unplanned IP 
switch continued on SB12 after transition before they were switched to Soliris. One subject with 
unplanned IP switch stayed on SB12 throughout the study. The priority of IP switching sequence is 
described in “The statement for comparator dispensing strategy v2.0”. 
As some subjects would inevitably confront unplanned IP switch in Period 2 (from the comparator to 
SB12) for some period in the study, to ensure continuity of study treatment, information about the 
shortage and mitigation plan was shared with all subjects, Investigators, DSMB, and relevant 
institutions (including IEC/IRBs, regulatory agency, and others according to local regulations), and was 
approved if required by regulations before the implementation of unplanned IP switch. In particular, all 
subjects were thoroughly explained about the possibility, risks, and benefits of an unplanned IP switch 
and this would only happen after the subjects consented to proceed with the treatment with SB12 
instead of Soliris.  
At the same time, an additional source of the comparator was explored. The manufacturer of Soliris 
confirmed that US-sourced Soliris had the same quality with EU-sourced Soliris, which was the 
comparator in this study, and both Soliris from EU and US had been demonstrated equivalent PK 
profiles with comparable safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and PD profiles in SB12 Phase I study. 
After the investigation of additional source, the Sponsor decided to procure US-sourced Soliris in Nov 
2020. 
As of Mar 2021, the shortage was completely resolved by supplying US-sourced Soliris. All subjects 
were supplied with the IPs as planned in the study protocol with the exception of some subjects. To 
prevent any potential immunogenicity risk with frequent IP changes, the subjects who were in 
“unplanned IP switch” sequence were provided with SB12 until the study end. 
Impact of COVID-19 
The study protocol was amended on Aug 21, 2020 (Version 5.0) to reflect all 
recommendations/mitigations on COVID-19. 
Regardless of all contingency measures taken, several impacts were inevitable during the study 
conduct. COVID-19 pandemic had an effect not only on the continuation of treatment of subjects but 
also on the overall process of study conduct. The impacts of COVID-19 are summarised in the following 
categories: 
1.  COVID-19 Infection: A total of 10 subjects were confirmed positive with COVID-19. Each 
COVID-19 case was reported to the Sponsor via the COVID-19 positive case reporting form 
and reviewed by the Sponsor to provide recommendations to Investigators for the subject to 
take appropriate actions. Each subject was managed based on the subject condition and local 
guidelines for COVID-19. All COVID-19 cases were captured as AEs. 
2.  Visit/Assessment Delay: During the study period, COVID-19 related issues, including 
quarantine due to COVID-19 infection, caused several visit/assessment delays. In case of 
COVID-19 related visit/assessment delay, it was captured as protocol deviation with COVID-19 
flag. 
o  S01 (out of window): A total of 10 cases in 9 subjects 
o  S05 (Visit 1 out of window): A total of 4 cases in 4 subjects 
Assessment report  
EMA/203468/2023  
Page 64/129 
 
 
 
 
o  S07, S08, S09, S12, S14, S16, and S18 (study procedures not done at pre-dose on 
scheduled visit): A total of 2 cases in 2 subjects (for each protocol deviation code) 
o  S19 (ET visit out of window): A total of 1 case in 1 subject 
3.  Local Laboratory Usage as Alternative Procedure: Due to transient shipment restrictions under 
COVID-19 circumstances, the laboratory samples for some visits were unable to ship out from 
the investigational site to the central laboratory. Considering the subject safety, the local 
laboratory tests were conducted as an alternative means to monitor the subject’s safety and 
treatment effect, and the results were captured on the eCRF. These alternative measures were 
performed on some visits of three subjects in one investigational site. 
4.  Site Transfer: One investigational site  was designated as COVID-19 hospital by the 
government, and it did not allow visits for non-COVID-19 patients. As a result, one subject  
was transferred to another investigational site  located in the same city.  
5.  Re-screening: Due to COVID-19 restrictions at the investigational site, the subject inscreening 
was unable to complete the screening activities. Therefore, one subject  was allowed to be re-
screened  after the restriction was lifted as it was considered as a technical issue. Subjects 
whose screening failed due to COVID-19 were recorded on eCRF. 
6.  Remote SDV: The Sponsor initially planned 100% of on-site SDV and source data review 
(SDR). However, after COVID-19 outbreak, the travel restrictions at some investigational sites 
prohibited the monitor’s on-site visits. As a mitigation plan, the Sponsor adopted partial and 
remote SDV/SDR approach only for the investigational sites in which the on-site monitoring 
visit was not allowed. Remote SDV/SDR was conducted under circumstances that a 
conventional approach of on-site SDV/SDR was not possible while there was the necessity to 
source-verify critical data points to ensure the integrity of study data. Remote SDV was only 
implemented to investigational sites or countries where the local privacy law and regulations 
allowed, and necessary permissions were obtained according to the local requirements. With 
the implementation of remote SDV/SDR on any certain investigational sites, the SDV approach 
of those investigational sites was switched to partial SDV from 100% SDV.

Prior and Concomitant Medications 
A similar proportion of subjects in both actual treatment sequences had taken medications which 
started and stopped prior to the study (i.e., prior medication): 11 (44.0%) subjects in the actual Soliris 
to SB12 treatment sequence, 9 (37.5%) subjects in the actual SB12 to All treatment sequence. 
A total of 48 (98.0%) subjects received at least 1 concomitant medication (40 subjects in the SB12 
treatment group and 40 subjects in the Soliris treatment group, respectively). The most frequently 
(reported by > 10% subjects in either treatment group) reported concomitant medications by PT in the 
SB12 and Soliris treatment groups, respectively, were folic acid (16 [34.0%] and 15 [31.9%] 
subjects), paracetamol (9 [19.1%] and 9 [19.1%] subjects), prednisolone (6 [12.8%] and 8 [17.0%] 
subjects), danazol (1 [2.1%] and 9 [19.1%] subjects), ciprofloxacin (3 [6.4%] and 6 [12.8%] 
subjects), and other viral vaccines (3 [6.4%] and 6 [12.8%] subjects). 
•  Numbers analysed 
The number of subjects included in each analysis set for planned or actual treatment sequence (i.e. 
Soliris to SB12 or SB12 to All [SB12 to Soliris and Unplanned IP Switch]) is summarised in table 18 
below.

(randomised set)  
•  Outcomes and estimation 
The primary efficacy endpoint was LDH level (U/L) at Week 26. 
The primary efficacy analysis was performed for the PPS-single using a linear model with treatment 
and gender as fixed effects. In the PPS-single, the 2-sided 95% CI of the estimated LSM difference in 
LDH level at Week 26 between SB12 and Soliris treatment group (SB12 − Soliris: 34.48, 95% CI 
[−47.66, 116.62]) completely lied within the pre-defined equivalence margin of [−337.2 to 337.2].

Table 19: Analysis of primary endpoint: LDH (U/L) at week (per-protocol set for LDH at a 
single time point) 
The robustness of LDH (U/L) at Week 26 was explored by performing the same analysis for the M-FAS 
using complete case analysis and multiple imputation method. 
Taking missing data into account, the results from sensitivity analyses on the M-FAS by both 
methods validated the robustness of the primary analysis from the PPS-single. 
The complete case analysis was based on the M-FAS where subjects with non-missing LDH values at 
Week 26 showed that findings of the estimated LSM difference in LDH (U/L) levels at Week 26 between 
SB12 and Soliris treatment groups (SB12 − Soliris: 34.48, 95% CI [−47.66, 116.62]) were consistent 
with those from the primary analysis. 
Multiple imputation method that assumed missing data were MAR provided the consistent estimated 
LSM difference in LDH (U/L) level at Week 26 between SB12 and Soliris treatment groups (SB12 − 
Soliris: 26.91, 95% CI [−56.24, 110.05]) with the primary analysis.

Overall, the number of patients with elevated LDH levels > 2 × ULN was comparable between the 
actual treatment groups (SB12:Soliris, 11:13), but number of events of elevated LDH levels > 2 × ULN 
as well as exposure-adjusted event rates (EAER) were higher in patients on SB12 treatment in both 
periods (events: SB12:Soliris, 49:27; EAER: SB12:Soliris: 2.07:1.39).

Number of Units of pRBCs Transfused throughout the Study Period 
The overall units of pRBC transfused were decreased after study treatment initiation in both planned 
treatment sequences. There was no statistically significant difference in the median number of units of 
pRBCs transfused between the planned Soliris to SB12 and SB12 to Soliris treatment sequences 
throughout the study duration.

Other Efficacy Results 
According to the applicant, the 90% CI lied within the pre-defined equivalence range [0.77 to 1.29], as 
required by FDA.

A trend of mean reduction from baseline in severity scores (0-10 scale) for all PNH-related symptoms 
(fatigue, haemoglobinuria, chest pain, abdominal pain, dyspnoea, dysphagia, erectile dysfunction) was 
observed at Week 26 and Week 52 in both treatment groups.

Breakthrough Haemolysis 
TEAEs related to BTH were reported more frequently in more subjects in the SB12 treatment group [22 
TEAEs in 8/47 (17.0%) subjects vs 3 TEAEs in 1/47 (2.1%) subject in the Soliris treatment group; 
Table below].  
According to the narratives provided, 4 subjects reported TEAEs related to BTH in the SB12 treatment 
group during Period 1 (vs 0 in the Soliris group). During Period 2, 3 subjects had TEAEs related to BTH 
while receiving SB12 treatment, and 1 subject had TEAEs related to BTH while treated with Soliris and 
again after the unplanned IP switch back to SB12. In addition, one subject, who had experienced 
TEAEs related to BTH during Period 1, had another TEAE related to BTH during Period 2 after the 
unplanned IP switch back to SB12. 
The majority of TEAEs were of Grade 1 (13 of 25 TEAEs in 5 [62.5%] subjects) or Grade 2 (11 of 25 
TEAEs in 5 [62.5%] subjects) in severity, and most of TEAEs were resolved during the study period. 
One (12.5%) subject who had serious TEAE (of haemolysis) was of Grade 3 while treated with SB12 
during Period 2, which did not lead to permanent IP discontinuation.

The applicant performed a post-hoc assessment on individual patients to identify any confounding 
factors related to suboptimal C5 inhibition, complement-amplifying conditions or delayed 
administration of IP which may have contributed to the numerical imbalance of BTH event between the 
two treatment groups observed in Study SB12-3003.

patients by treatment group (safety set, study SB12-3003) (ad hoc analysis) 
Major Adverse Vascular Events 
One MAVE (portal vein thrombosis) as serious TEAE of Grade 5 in severity was reported in the Soliris 
treatment group during the study period. The event occurred in the same patient who died during the 
study. 
An adult received a total of 8 IP administrations (Soliris) after the most recent IP administration, the 
subject had an adverse event of portal vein thrombosis of Grade 5 in severity. This event was 
determined to be serious and considered as a major adverse vascular event (MAVE) that was not 
related to breakthrough haemolysis. The adverse event of portal vein thrombosis led to death on Study 
Day 165.

According to the applicant, the 90% CI lied within the pre-defined equivalence 
range [0.77 to 1.29], as required by FDA. As this endpoint was not required 
by EMA, and hence no equivalence range has been defined, the results can 
only be regarded as supportive for the current MAA.

Design and conduct of clinical studies 
SB12-3003 was a randomized, double-blind, multicentre, comparative clinical Phase III study (SB12-
3003) in treatment-naïve patients with PNH to evaluate the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics and 
immunogenicity of SB12 and Soliris. Fifty subjects were randomised 1:1 to treatment sequence I 
(SB12 to Soliris) or treatment sequence II (Soliris to SB12). Subjects who were randomised to initially 
receive SB12 were switched to receive Soliris and subjects who were randomised to initially receive 
Soliris were switched to receive SB12 at Week 26. Study treatment was given until Week 50. Although 
in general the study duration of 52 weeks is acceptable, the cross-over design was strongly 
discouraged during EMA Scientific Advice, mainly due to the short observation period of 26 weeks for 
efficacy and safety evaluation.  
Due to shortage of the comparator, 8 subjects received SB12 instead of Soliris at some visits during 
Period 2, while others received US-sourced Soliris instead of EU-Soliris, to ensure the continuity of 
study treatment. The shortage of EU-sourced comparator is acknowledged and the resulting events of 
unplanned switch to SB12 or US-Soliris in Period 2 to maintain treatment are considered appropriate 
given the circumstances. No specific concerns arise from using US-sourced Soliris, as biosimilarity 
between EU- and US-sourced Soliris could be demonstrated based on quality and clinical pharmacology 
data. As the unplanned switch and/or use of US-sourced Soliris only occurred during Period 2, after 
assessment of the primary endpoint, the primary evaluation regarding efficacy would not be impacted. 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria were largely in line with registrational studies for Soliris in PNH 
(TRIUMPH and SHEPHERD). The enrolment of treatment-naïve patients with PNH was also the 
preferred study population in EMA Scientific Advice and is therefore accepted.  
The primary endpoint was to compare LDH levels, which is acceptable given the absence of a suitable 
clinical endpoint to assess the efficacy of eculizumab in PNH. However, an earlier timepoint for the 
primary assessment (currently Week 26), before treatment response has reached the plateau, would 
have been more appropriate. In addition, due to its low specificity, including a more specific and 
predictive PD marker for clinical efficacy and pharmacological action of eculizumab is considered 
essential. Although the applicant could justify the use of the terminal complex ELISA to assess PD, the 
absence of the functional CH50 adds  some uncertainty regarding the comparability of efficacy. LDH 
profile over time and number of units of pRBC transfused as secondary efficacy endpoints are 
accepted.  
The sample size calculation is reproducible under the given parameters. The applicant could 
satisfactorily justify the discrepancies between the ULN used for the sample size calculation of [−1.2 × 
ULN, 1.2 × ULN], where ULN = 223 U/L, and the equivalence margin of the primary the primary 
efficacy analysis, where ULN = 281 U/L; sample size calculation was based on the ULN from the 
reference study (TRIUMPH [Hillmen et al., 2006]), and the ULN to define the limits for the 
demonstration of equivalence in the primary efficacy endpoint was based on the specification of 
laboratory parameters chosen for the study. The use of different cut-offs is acceptable, but the use of 
Assessment report  
EMA/203468/2023  
Page 89/129 
 
 
 
ULN to derive a margin for equivalence as such is questioned, and the justification for the clinical 
irrelevance of [−1.2 × ULN, 1.2 × ULN] based on the SD and the absolute LDH level observed in 
pivotal Soliris studies is not agreed. Given the high fluctuations of LDH levels in PNH patients in 
general, a high SD on the population level is to be expected, and does not indicate clinical irrelevance 
on an individual patient level. Moreover, no rationale for interpreting the difference of LDH levels based 
on the ULN as clinically irrelevant has been provided, but in general, this strategy is considered not 
meaningful.  
The overall process for randomization appears appropriate. No stratification was included, which is 
acceptable, given the limited sample size. 
Strategies to ensure double-blinding for the treatment sequence assignment are appropriate. 
The overall statistical approach is considered acceptable. However, the handling of missing data is not 
considered optimal. The missing at random assumption is strong and could lead to the attenuation of 
difference between the treatment arms. Nevertheless, considering that the vast majority of 
randomized patients (92%) completed Period 1 of the study, the impact on the primary analysis of 
efficacy is considered minimal, therefore, no concern is raised. 
There were five global amendments to the original protocol, mainly to facilitate recruitment, clarify 
several study procedures and to address issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which are 
acknowledged and overall appropriate. With Amendment 4 (Version 5.0), a 2 year extension period to 
assess the long-term safety was removed and replaced by an open-label extended supply of SB12. 
Further details on participating subjects were requested. The applicant has provided the requested 
information on the status of the subjects from the open-label extension period. All patients completing 
the week 50 treatment (n=46) were enrolled into the extension period. As of Oct 15, 2022, 2 patients 
completed the extension period, and 7 patients discontinued from the extension period, with the 
majority of reasons being moving to another country due to the war in Ukraine. Amendment 5 (Version 
6.0) included the update to address the shortage of comparator. The overall strategy for the selection 
of subjects receiving unplanned IP switch appear appropriate. A summary showing the recruitment 
timeline of subjects with unplanned IP switch compared to subjects who did not have unplanned IP 
switch was provided upon request and the sequence of events could be followed.  
Major protocol deviations were observed at similar frequencies between treatment sequences, except 
deviations related to COVID-19 restrictions, which occurred more frequently in the Soliris to SB12 
treatment sequence [7/25 (28%) vs 3/25 (12%) in the SB12 to Soliris sequence]. These protocol 
deviations included out of visit window [6/25 (24%) vs 3/25 (12%) in the SB12 to Soliris sequence]. 
Upon request, the applicant provided information of the distribution of protocol deviations related to 
COVID-19 restrictions. Most COVID-19-related deviations occurred during Period 2, which coincided 
with regional COVID-19 outbreaks (Nov 2020 to Dec 2020), which can be followed. During Period 1, 
more patients on Soliris treatment (3 patients, 12%) had COVID-19-related deviations compared to 1 
(4.2%) patient on SB12 treatment. During Period 2, more patients on SB12 treatment (6 patients, 
19.4%) had COVID-19-related deviations compared to 2 (9.1%) patients on Soliris treatment. Thus, 
an imbalance between treatments was observed during both periods, but favouring different 
treatments in different periods. The overall imbalance observed is therefore likely a chance finding. 
Demographic characteristics and baseline disease characteristics were overall variable between 
treatment arms, which is likely attributed to the very limited sample size due to the orphan nature of 
the disease. The study was conducted predominantly in an Asian population (54% of subjects). Upon 
request, the applicant performed subgroup analyses of efficacy and safety between Asian vs Non-Asian 
to detect any potential differences between two subgroups in Study SB12-3003. The analysis showed 
that distribution of demographic characteristics of Race and Ethnicity is comparable between the 
planned treatment sequences. Moreover, no difference in primary efficacy (LDH at Week 26) result 
Assessment report  
EMA/203468/2023  
Page 90/129 
 
 
 
between Asian and Non-Asian patients was observed. Thus, the extrapolation of the efficacy results 
obtained in Study SB12-3003 to Non-Asian population is reasonable. Reassuringly, overall mean LDH 
levels at baseline were comparable [2156.0 U/L (Soliris to SB12) vs 2220.2 U/L (SB12 to Soliris)]. 
Nevertheless, the applicant was asked to discuss and contextualize the differences in baseline 
characteristics including, but not limited to, PNH clone size in the treatment arms. The applicant 
confirmed that there were numerical differences observed in certain baseline characteristics, but that 
there was no significant difference in all baseline disease characteristics. Regarding the clinical 
importance of the baseline differences observed in Type II RBCs PNH clone size and Type III RBCs PNH 
clone size between the treatment sequences, the applicant provided literature showing that analysis of 
PNH clone size of white blood cells might be more informative than analysis of PNH clone size of RBC 
alone when assessing PNH patients. This is acknowledged. Of note, the white blood clone size was very 
similar between the two treatment sequences. Regarding the numerical differences observed in total 
number of packed red blood cell 12 months prior to Screening between the two treatment sequences, 
the applicant clarified that this might be due to 2 patients with the highest number of packed red blood 
cell received being randomized to the SB12 to Soliris sequence.  
While most prior and concomitant medications were overall comparable between treatment groups, 
more patients in the Soliris group received concomitant danazol treatment [9/47 (19.1%) vs 1/47 
(2.1%) in SB12 group]. Upon request, the applicant clarified that all of the patients with concomitant 
danazol treatment (in total 9 patients) were on this treatment before study start. Out of the 9 patients, 
8 were randomized to the Soliris to SB12 sequence and 1 patient was randomized to the SB12 to 
Soliris sequence. Most of the patients stopped danazol treatment within a few months from study start. 
It is agreed, that the observed discrepancy in danazol treatment frequencies might have rather been 
by chance due to the randomization process. In addition, the applicant provided a sensitivity analysis 
of the primary efficacy endpoint with danazol treatment as a covariate. The results suggest that 
danazol might not have had an impact on the primary efficacy analysis. Furthermore, patients on 
danazol treatment did not report any clinically significant laboratory findings nor relevant TEAEs 
throughout the study. Thus, the impact on safety also seems to be negligible. Overall, due to the 
cross-over study design, pre-existing factors potentially confounding the efficacy outcome could likely 
be distinguished from study variables that influence the outcome. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The primary efficacy endpoint evaluation, LDH levels at Week 26, was performed on the PPS-single 
analysis set. The LSM LDH levels at Week 26 were 284.20 U/L in the SB12, and 249.72 U/L in the 
Soliris treatment group, which is in the range of what would be expected from registrational studies for 
Soliris. The 2-sided 95% CI of the estimated LSM difference between SB12 and Soliris treatment group 
(SB12 − Soliris: 34.48, 95% CI [−47.66, 116.62]) completely lied within the pre-defined equivalence 
margin of [−337.2 to 337.2]. Results from sensitivity analyses on the M-FAS, taking missing data into 
account, validated the robustness of the primary analysis from the PPS-single. While the complete case 
analysis results on the M-FAS were identical to the results from PPS-single analysis, the M-FAS with 
multiple imputation method provided an estimated LSM difference in LDH (U/L) level at Week 26 
between SB12 and Soliris treatment groups (SB12 − Soliris: 26.91, 95% CI [−56.24, 110.05]), 
consistent with the primary analysis. Although the clinical irrelevance of the proposed equivalence 
margin is questionable, the observed 2-sided 95% CI of the estimated LSM difference was clearly 
below the suggested margin [−1.2 × ULN, 1.2 × ULN] in all analysis sets. Therefore, despite remaining 
uncertainties, confirmation of biosimilarity is provided from the primary endpoint. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints, LDH profile over time and number of pRBC units transfused, were 
descriptively summarised and appeared similar between treatment groups. However, a trend of higher 
Assessment report  
EMA/203468/2023  
Page 91/129 
 
 
 
 
mean LDH levels in patients treated with SB12 was observed at Week 26, Week 52 and for time-
adjusted AUEC from Week 14 to Week 26 and from Week 40 to Week 52 (primary endpoint for FDA, 
which formally demonstrated biosimilarity). Furthermore, LDH levels of individual patients indicated 
more frequently a pronounced increase while on SB12 treatment compared to patients on Soliris 
treatment. Upon request, the applicant presented a summary of subjects who experienced LDH levels 
> 2 x ULN during the maintenance phase, i.e. excluding the induction phase up to Week 4. Although 
the number of patients with elevated LDH levels > 2 × ULN was comparable between the actual 
treatment groups (SB12:Soliris, 11:13), the number of events of elevated LDH levels > 2 x ULN was 
higher in patients on SB12 treatment in both periods (total: 49 vs 27 events in SB12 and Soliris, 
respectively), as was the exposure-adjusted event rate (EAER; SB12:Soliris: 2.07:1.39) to account for 
different exposure due to the unplanned IP switch back to SB12 in Period 2. The applicant identified 3 
subjects who experienced the majority of total events of LDH levels > 2 x ULN (47/76, 62% of 
reported events). When excluding events from these patients, the numerical imbalance of events of 
elevated LDH levels > 2 × ULN between patients on SB12 and Soliris became narrowed to 17 events 
(SB12) versus 12 events (Soliris). Hence, the frequency of elevated LDH levels > 2 x ULN was still 
42% higher during SB12 vs Soliris for the remaining patients. Moreover, although all 3 identified 
subjects who experienced the majority of total events had these events during SB12 and Soliris 
treatment, a clear imbalance towards more frequent events while on SB12 treatment even in those 3 
subjects is noted. In many instances, elevated LDH levels > 2 x ULN were associated with extended 
dosing intervals and patients without dose delay were less likely to have elevated LDH level > 2 x ULN 
(overall 28.1%) compared to patients who had a dose interval of 17 days or more at least once 
(50.0%). Hence, despite numerical imbalances, it is agreed that elevated LDH levels are more likely to 
occur after extended dosing intervals and are manageable by shortening the dosing intervals in most 
cases. 
Higher LDH levels may indicate lower eculizumab exposure, e.g. due to dose delays, and may be 
associated with the occurrence of breakthrough haemolysis (BTH), which could point towards reduced 
efficacy. Indeed, TEAEs related to BTH were reported more frequently in more subjects in the SB12 
treatment group [22 TEAEs in 8/47 (17.0%) subjects vs 3 TEAEs in 1/47 (2.1%) subject in the Soliris 
treatment group], which is also reflected in a lower reduction from baseline in haemoglobinuria 
severity scores in both periods. Upon request to provide more details about the 2 year open-label 
extension period, the applicant noted that, as of Oct 15, 2022, 6 out of 8 patients who experienced 
BTH were still receiving SB12 and none of the patients discontinued from the study due to ‘lack of 
efficacy’. 
Moreover, according to the applicant, most BTH events can be explained by 1 of 3 confounding factors, 
which include complement-amplifying conditions, such as infections, and delayed administration of IP. 
Upon request, the applicant provided an extended overview on subjects experiencing breakthrough 
haemolysis, including baseline characteristics, individual LDH levels over time and at the time of the 
event, and details on the treatment (dose, time of dose, treatment duration). Furthermore, a 
comparison showing the incidence of proposed confounding factors #1 (dose delay ≥ 17 days) and #2 
(consecutive dosing intervals of 15 or 16 days) for BTH across both treatment groups, irrespective of 
the occurrence of BTH events, was provided. The incidence of confounding factor #1 (dose delay ≥ 17 
days due to quarantine by COVID-19 infection) was higher in patients on SB12 compared to patients 
on Soliris, as more patients on SB12 (7 patients) were infected to COVID-19 compared to patients on 
Soliris (3 patients). The proportion of patients with dose delay due to quarantine by COVID-19 
infection and reported BTH events was 4/7 patients for SB12 and 1/3 patient for Soliris. Since it is 
agreed that the overall higher incidence of COVID-19 infections in SB12 treated patients is likely 
caused by local outbreaks, it appears that COVID-19-related dose delays ≥ 17 days favour the 
occurrence of BTH events, independent of treatment. The incidence of confounding factor #2 
(consecutive dosing intervals of 15 or 16 days) was comparable between patients on SB12 and Soliris, 
Assessment report  
EMA/203468/2023  
Page 92/129 
 
 
 
but only patients on SB12 reported BTH events (3/9 vs 0/8 on Soliris), all of which occurred during 
Period 2. These findings suggest that BTH events are independent of extended dosing intervals of 15 or 
16 days. However, as overall numbers are low, this may be a chance finding and a final conclusion 
cannot be drawn. 
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Although uncertainties remain regarding the clinical irrelevance of the equivalence margin for the 
primary endpoint, and occurrence of more frequent BTH events during SB12 treatment, biosimilarity is 
supported by a narrow 95% CI of the primary efficacy endpoint and results from secondary endpoints 
LDH profile over time and number of pRBC units transfused. 
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
The clinical safety of SB12 has been assessed in two clinical studies, a clinical Phase I pharmacokinetic 
(PK) study in healthy subjects (SB12-1001) and a clinical Phase III efficacy and safety study in 
patients with PNH (SB12-3003). Safety of SB12 in these studies was assessed by monitoring adverse 
events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), adverse events special interest (AESI) (e.g. meningococcal infection, 
other systemic infection, infusion-related reaction), vital signs, and laboratory evaluations as well as 
immunogenicity, which is an important safety aspect of therapeutic proteins. The AEs were coded using 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities version (MedDRA version 21.0) and guided by the grading 
of the NCI-CTCAE version 5.0. 
A pooled safety analysis of the two clinical studies is not applicable due to heterogeneity of the study 
population (healthy subjects versus patients with PNH) and duration of treatment/exposure (multiple-
dose versus single-dose). Due to the low number of included subjects/patients and the design of the 
studies, the safety data collected from these studies can only provide limited information on 
comparability of safety and immunogenicity of SB12 and the reference products. 
2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure 
Phase I study SB12-1001 
In the clinical Phase I study SB12-1001, a total of 240 subjects were randomized to receive a single IV 
dose of eculizumab with 80 subjects in each three treatment groups (SB12, EU Soliris, or US Soliris), 
respectively. The Safety Set (SAF) consisted of all subjects who received investigational product (IP).  
Phase III study SB12-3003 
In clinical Phase III study SB12-3003, a total of 50 subjects were randomly allocated to each 
treatment sequence.

COVID-19 Infections 
Any TEAEs for COVID-19 [8/47 (17.0%), 0.34 EAER] and TEAEs among COVID-19 infected subjects 
[10/47 (21.3%), 1.84 EAER] were more frequently reported in patients during SB12 treatment 
compared to Soliris [3/47 (6.4%), 0.15 EAER and 6/47 (12.8%), 1.17 EAER, respectively].  
All TEAEs for COVID-19 were of Grade 1 (5 of 11 TEAEs in 4 [8.2%] subjects) or Grade 2 (6 of 11 
TEAEs in 6 [12.2%] subjects) in severity and were not considered related to IP by 
Investigator/Sponsor. Only 3 TEAEs for COVID-19 were reported as symptomatic (fever), and rest of 
them were reported as asymptomatic. All of them were resolved during the study period. 
No serious TEAEs for COVID-19 were reported, and one serious TEAEs among COVID-19 infected 
subject was reported in the SB12 treatment group (haemolysis; TEAEs related to breakthrough 
haemolysis, see below). 
Breakthrough Haemolysis and Major Adverse Vascular Events 
A total of 22 TEAEs related to breakthrough haemolysis were reported in 8 (17.0%) subjects in the 
SB12 treatment group and 3 TEAEs related to breakthrough haemolysis were reported in 1 (2.1%) 
subject in the Soliris treatment group (Table below).

2.6.8.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Phase I study SB12-1001 
There were no deaths and no discontinuations due to TEAEs in study SB12-1001. Two SAEs were 
reported, and both were considered not related to IP by the Investigator. One subject in the SB12 
group had renal colic and one subject in the US-sourced Soliris group had back pain. Thus, the 
proportion of subjects with SAEs was comparable among the treatment groups, and no concerns 
regarding biosimilarity arise. 
Phase III study SB12-3003 
Deaths 
One death occurred due to a MAVE that was not related to breakthrough haemolysis in the Soliris arm. 
The male subject received 8 doses of Soliris during Period 1, before the subject withdrew from the 
study due to death led by the AE of portal vein thrombosis (Grade 5) on study day 165, 70 days after 
the most recent IP administration at Week 10. According to the applicant, the event was considered 
not related to the IP. No safety concerns arise from this event regarding SB12 treatment, since the 
subject has not received any SB12 treatment. 
Other Serious Adverse Events 
The SAEs are summarised for the SAF by actual treatment sequence in the Table below.  
Three serious TEAEs were reported in 3 (6.4%) in the SB12 treatment group and 3 serious TEAEs in 2 
(4.3%) subjects in the Soliris treatment group. Haemolysis, wound infection bacterial and hand 
fracture as serious TEAEs in the SB12 treatment group were reported as not related to IP. Two serious 
TEAEs (cellulitis and infusion site hypersensitivity) in the Soliris treatment group were considered to be 
related to the IP. Outcome of a serious TEAE of portal vein thrombosis was fatal and other 5 serious

2.6.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
Phase I study SB12-1001 
Haematology 
Mean and median values of all parameters of hematology did not show any relevant changes over 
time. A few subjects had shifts from normal hematology values at baseline to values outside the 
normal range post-baseline. There were no clinically significant changes from baseline in hematology 
values in any treatment group. 
Biochemistry 
Mean and median values of all parameters of biochemistry did not show any relevant changes over 
time. A few subjects had shifts from normal biochemistry values at baseline to values outside the 
normal range post-baseline. Except for Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) in 1 subject (EU Soliris 
treatment group), with reported TEAE of upper respiratory tract infection on day 38 which resolved on 
day 47), there were no clinically significant changes from baseline in biochemistry values in any 
treatment group. 
Urinalysis 
Mean and median values of all continuous parameters of urinalysis did not show any relevant changes 
over time. Categorical parameters of urinalysis did not show any relevant changes over time. A few 
subjects had shifts from normal urinalysis values at baseline to values outside the normal range post-

baseline. There were no clinically significant changes from baseline in urinalysis values in any 
treatment group. 
Vital Signs 
Mean and median values of all vital sign parameters (body temperature, systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure, and pulse) did not show any changes over time. 
12-lead Electrocardiogram 
ECG values and changes from baseline of heart rate, RR interval, PR interval, QRS interval, QT interval, 
QTcF interval, and QTcB interval were presented. Mean and median values of all ECG parameters did 
not show any relevant changes over time. Minor alterations were similar to those usually observed in 
healthy subjects. 
One subject (SB12 treatment group) had a QTcF interval > 450 msec and ≤ 480 msec on Day 3; all 
other QTcF interval readings were ≤ 450 msec during the study. 
An absolute change from baseline of QTcF > 30 msec was observed in 3 subjects on Day 3 (all 3 
subjects were in the SB12 treatment group) and in 4 subjects on Day 64 (1 subject in the SB12 
treatment group, 2 subjects in the EU sourced Soliris treatment group, and 1 subject in the US sourced 
Soliris treatment group). QTcF absolute changes from baseline > 60 msec were not observed in any of 
the subjects. 
Interpretation of ECG recordings showed some abnormalities, but none of these abnormalities reached 
clinical relevance as judged by the Investigator. 
Physical Examination Findings 
A total of 24 subjects had 40 abnormal findings for the physical examination results evaluated as 
clinically significant by the Investigator (14 events in 9 subjects in the SB12 treatment group, 12 
events in 6 subjects in the EU sourced Soliris treatment group, and 14 events in 9 subjects in the US 
sourced Soliris treatment group, respectively). The most frequently reported clinically significant 
physical examination abnormalities were reported in the body system of skin; i.e., 8 events were 
reported in 4 subjects in the SB12 treatment group, 6 events were reported in 2 subjects in the EU 
sourced Soliris treatment group, and 5 events were reported in 5 subjects in the US sourced Soliris 
treatment group. 
Pregnancy 
All female subjects had negative results for pregnancy. 
A case of pregnancy was reported for the female partner of one subject. The subject received US 
sourced Soliris. Contraception measures as instructed were not followed; condom only was used as 
method of contraception. The Investigator was informed that the female partner had undergone 
elective termination of the pregnancy, for private reasons. No complications were reported. The 
pregnancy outcome was reported by the male participant; the female partner refused further contacts 
and/or provision of the hospital discharge report.

Phase III study SB12-3003 
Haematology  
There were no notable differences in mean and median values for haematology parameters observed, 
and changes in mean values from baseline were comparable between actual Soliris to SB12 and actual 
SB12 to All treatment sequences. 
Haemoglobin at Baseline was 85.9 g/L and 88.5 g/L in actual Soliris to SB12 and actual SB12 to All 
treatment sequences, respectively. Haemoglobin at Week 26 was 106.7 g/L and 108.2 g/L and 
haemoglobin at Week 52 was 113.8 g/L and 109.2 g/L in actual Soliris to SB12 and actual SB12 to All 
treatment sequences, respectively. Hence, mean haemoglobin levels were increased to a similar extent 
in both treatment groups at Weeks 26 and 52. 
For each haematology parameter, observed shift patterns were comparable between actual Soliris to 
SB12 and actual SB12 to All treatment sequences. 
Clinically significant abnormalities of haemoglobin were reported in 11 (22.4%) subjects at baseline (6 
[24.0%] subjects in actual Soliris to SB12 treatment sequence and 5 [20.8%] subjects in actual SB12 
to All treatment sequence). Upon completion of the initial phase, clinically significant level of 
haemoglobin was reported in 3 (7.0%) subjects at Week 6 (2 [9.1%] subjects and 1 [4.8%] subject in 
each actual treatment sequence, respectively). At Week 52, no subject was reported with clinically 
significant level of haemoglobin. There were no notable trends in clinically significant abnormalities of 
other haematology parameters. 
Chemistry 
There were no notable differences in mean and median values for chemistry parameters observed, and 
changes in mean values from baseline were comparable between actual Soliris to SB12 and actual 
SB12 to All treatment sequences.  
For each chemistry parameter, observed shift patterns were comparable between actual Soliris to SB12 
and actual SB12 to All treatment sequences. 
Few subjects had clinically significant abnormalities in some chemistry parameters (i.e. creatinine, 
bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase) in both actual Soliris to SB12 and 
actual SB12 to All treatment sequences during the study period. There were no notable trends in 
clinically significant abnormalities of chemistry parameters.  
Coagulation  
There were no notable differences in mean and median values for coagulation parameters observed 
between actual Soliris to SB12 and actual SB12 to All treatment sequences. 
For each coagulation parameter, observed shift patterns were comparable between actual Soliris to 
SB12 and actual SB12 to All treatment sequences. 
Few subjects had clinically significant abnormalities in prothrombin time (i.e., 3 subjects with 
prothrombin time above the significant abnormal range at week 14) and active partial thromboplastin 
time (i.e., 2 subjects at baseline, 1 subject at week 14 and also at week 26 and 3 subjects at week 52, 
all subjects had active partial thromboplastin time above the significant abnormal range) in both actual 
Soliris to SB12 and actual SB12 to All treatment sequences. There were no notable trends in clinically 
significant abnormalities of coagulation parameters.

Urinalysis 
There were no notable changes in mean values from baseline for continuous parameters between 
actual Soliris to SB12 and actual SB12 to All treatment sequences. The proportion of subjects with 
each result for categorical parameters was comparable between actual Soliris to SB12 and actual SB12 
to All treatment sequences. 
Other laboratory parameters  
There were no notable changes in median values for ferritin, vitamin B12, and folate observed between 
actual Soliris to SB12 and actual SB12 to All treatment sequences. 
For ferritin, vitamin B12, and folate, the observed shift patterns were comparable between actual 
Soliris to SB12 and actual SB12 to All treatment sequences. 
Vital Signs and Weight 
There were minimal changes in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and body 
temperature from baseline to Week 26 and Week 52 with no marked differences among treatment 
sequences. At Week 52, there were no clinically significant abnormalities (high/low) in vital signs were 
reported in any treatment sequence. 
Twelve-lead Electrocardiogram Results 
No clinically significant abnormal 12-lead ECG results were observed during the study period. 
Physical Examination 
There were no notable changes in physical examination assessments during the study period. 
Pregnancy 
One subject in the SB12 treatment group was reported with pregnancy. There was no previous known 
maternal history. Contraception measures used at the time were oral contraceptives and condoms. At 
subject’s will, the subject decided with abortion by taking abortion medication (mifepristone). The 
subject was withdrawn from the study due to pregnancy. Pregnancy reports for this subject were 
provided.

2.6.8.7.  Immunological events 
Bioanalytical assays – immunogenicity 
A bridging ligand-binding assay was used for the detection of ADAs in the clinical Phase I study (SB12-
1001) and clinical Phase III study (SB12-3003). ADAs against eculizumab (SB12 and Soliris) in human 
serum were detected and confirmed in human serum using a multi-tiered approach in an ECL assay. In 
this assay, the qualitative and quasi-quantitative determination of ADAs in human serum samples was 
conducted by using a validated MSD platform. At confirmatory assay (Tier 2), the assay is based on 
the use of excess unlabeled SB12 in a competitive binding format to demonstrate the specificity of the 
binding interactions in the antibody/labeled drug complex.  
In tier 3, a competitive ligand binding assay was also used for detection of NAbs in the clinical Phase I 
in addition to the titration assay. NAbs against eculizumab (SB12 and Soliris) in human serum were 
detected using a single tier acid dissociation, competitive ligand binding ECL assay using BEAD. 
Phase I study SB12-1001 
Evaluation of immunogenicity was secondary objective of the study SB12-1001. 
The incidence of ADA and NAb to eculizumab for all analysed subjects at each time point are 
summarised in the Table below. 
Overall, the incidence of ADA to eculizumab was low and comparable across all the 3 treatment groups 
of eculizumab. One subject in the US-sourced Soliris group was ADA positive pre-dose. Three subjects 
had a post-dose ADA positive result. Two of the positive ADA subjects were in the SB12 treatment 
group and one in the EU-sourced Soliris group. There were no ADA positive subjects in the US-sourced 
Soliris group. 
None of the subjects with post-dose ADA to eculizumab had a positive result for NAb. 
No concerns arise from immunogenicity findings regarding biosimilarity.

2.6.8.9.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Phase I study SB12-1001 
None of the subjects discontinued IP due to TEAEs. 
Phase III study SB12-3003 
One TEAE of infusion-related hypersensitivity leading to IP discontinuation due to infusion-related 
hypersensitivity was reported in Soliris treatment group (at week 0 = first dose of IP). This event was 
Grade 3 in severity and was considered related to IP, classified as an AESI, occurred during Period 1 
and was resolved. No safety concerns regarding SB12 treatment arise from this event. 
2.6.8.10.  Post marketing experience 
Not Applicable.  
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
The safety of SB12 has been evaluated in two clinical studies (Phase I study SB12-1001 and Phase III 
study SB12-3003). Due to the heterogeneity of the studied population, the safety data of the two 
clinical studies has not been pooled, but provided separately for the two studies. This is regarded 
acceptable. 
Phase I study SB12-1001 
A total of 240 subjects were randomized in 1:1:1 ratio among the treatment groups SB12, EU-sourced 
Soliris and US-sourced Soliris (80 per treatment group). All of the subjects were included in the SAF. 
This is acceptable. 
The proportion of subjects with any AEs was similar among the groups: In the SB12 group, 72.5 % of 
the subjects had any AEs, in the EU-sourced Soliris group, 67.5% of the subjects had any AEs and in 
the US-sourced Soliris group, 73.8% of the subjects had any AEs. The proportion of subjects with any 
TEAEs was also similar among the groups (70.0% SB12, 65.0% EU Soliris and 71.3% US Soliris). Most 
of the TEAEs were mild or moderate. None of the TEAEs led to subject discontinuation. The proportion 
of subjects with any AESIs was also low and comparable among the treatment groups. No subject died 
during the study. In conclusion, there were no notable differences in the pattern of adverse events 
among the treatment groups. 
Two SAEs were reported. One subject in the SB12 group had renal colic and one subject in the US-
sourced Soliris group had back pain, both SAEs were considered not related to IP by the Investigator. 
Thus, the proportion of subjects with SAEs was comparable among the treatment groups. 
There were no notable differences in the laboratory findings (including haematology, biochemistry and 
urinalysis parameters) among the treatment groups in the Phase I study SB12-1001. The same holds 
true for the vital signs and physical examination parameters. 
Immunogenicity was also assessed in the Phase I study SB12-1001. The assay validation for the 
Assessment report  
EMA/203468/2023  
Page 112/129 
 
 
 
immunogenicity assays has been conducted and summaries as well as the detailed validation reports 
have been provided. The results of the validation work confirm that these assays are suitable for their 
intended use. The same holds true for the assay used in the Phase III study. One subject in the US-
sourced Soliris group was ADA positive pre-dose. The number of subjects with ADAs throughout the 
study was low, with only three subjects having a post-dose ADA positive result. Two of the positive 
ADA subjects were in the SB12 treatment group and one in the EU-sourced Soliris group. There were 
no ADA positive subjects in the US-sourced Soliris group. All of the positive ADA subjects had a 
negative NAb result. The proportion of subjects with ADAs was similar among the treatment groups in 
the Phase I study SB12-1001 and no concerns arise from the immunogenicity findings. 
Phase III SB12-3003 
In clinical Phase III study SB12-3003, a total of 50 subjects were randomly allocated to each 
treatment sequence. A total of 49 subjects (SB12: 24 subjects; Soliris: 25 subjects) received at least 1 
administration of SB12 or Soliris in Period 1. Hence, the safety data set for Period 1 is considered 
appropriate for the biosimilarity assessment regarding safety for the limited duration of 26 weeks, as 
numbers of subjects were in accordance with the pre-planned sample size target of 23 subjects per 
group. 
However, adequate interpretation/comparison of long term safety and immunogenicity data is 
compromised due to the cross-over design, which was strongly discouraged during EMA Scientific 
Advice. Although different N-glycan patterns between SB12 and Soliris have been identified (see 
Quality Section), no clinical concern was raised. From the reference product it is known that 
eculizumab has low immunogenic potential (infrequent and low antibody titre responses and no 
neutralizing antibodies were observed, see EPAR and PI Soliris). During the clinical development of 
SB12 there were only few subjects in the phase I study developing antibodies, of whom no subject had 
neutralising antibodies. The patient population included in the phase III study was treatment-naïve and 
can therefore be considered a sensitive population for detecting the occurrence of immunogenicity, 
albeit the overall number of subjects was low. Therefore, no issue was raised from a clinical 
perspective.  
In Period 2, after transition to other treatment at week 26, a total of 46 subjects received at least one 
study drug administration, but only 38 subjects (n=23 in SB12 group, n=15 in Soliris group) did not 
have unplanned IP switch during this period. Hence, the safety data set for Period 2 is even more 
reduced due to unplanned IP switch. The percentage of subjects with TEAEs in the Unplanned IP 
Switch treatment sequence (75.0%; 6 of 8 subjects) was comparable to the percentage of subjects 
with TEAEs in other treatment sequences (range from 65.2% to 69.6%) and no apparent safety 
concerns were observed for this subgroup of patients. 
During Period 1, the number of subjects reporting any TEAEs was comparable between treatment 
arms, but more subjects reported ≥ Grade 3 TEAEs in the Soliris treatment arm [3/25 (12%)] 
compared to SB12 [1/24 (4.2%)]. Treatment-related events were also reported more frequently in the 
Soliris group [6/25 (24.0%) compared to the SB12 group [3/24 (12.5%], as were AESI in the Soliris 
group [3/25 (12%); vs 0/24 (0%) in the SB12 group]. COVID-19 infections were observed at similar 
frequencies between study arms during Period 1. 
Although similar trends were observed during Period 1 compared to the overall summary including 
both Periods, there were also differences, highlighting the limitations of a short observation period in a 
small number of patients. For example, the overall frequency of ≥ Grade 3 TEAEs was higher while on 
SB12 treatment [6/47 (12.8%)] compared to Soliris [2/47 (4.3%)]. Similarly, COVID-19 related TEAEs 
were more frequently reported in patients during SB12 treatment [8/47 (17.0%)] compared to Soliris 
Assessment report  
EMA/203468/2023  
Page 113/129 
 
 
 
 
[3/47 (6.4%)]. 
During the whole study duration, the incidences of the most frequent TEAEs by SOC and PT were 
higher in the SB12 group compared to the Soliris group (corona virus infection, haemoglobinuria, 
diarrhoea, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased, hypertension), except headache, which was more 
frequent in the Soliris group. Hence, corona virus infections occurred overall more frequently during 
SB12 treatment, which were attributed to local outbreaks. COVID-19 related dose delays may be 
associated with events of breakthrough haemolysis. 
Overall, the majority of TEAEs were of Grade 1 or Grade 2. No TEAEs of Grade 4 (life-threatening 
event) were reported during the study period. One (2.1%) subject had TEAE of Grade 5 (fatal) portal 
vein thrombosis (MAVE) in the Soliris treatment group, which was considered not related to IP. Serious 
TEAEs were reported at similar frequencies, 3 in 3/47 (6.4%) subjects in the SB12 treatment group 
and 3 serious TEAEs in 2/47 (4.3%) subjects in the Soliris treatment group. 
No notable differences or abnormalities were observed in haematology parameters, chemistry, 
coagulation, urinalysis and other laboratory parameters. No safety concerns arise from laboratory 
parameters regarding biosimilarity.  
No ADA or NAb were detected throughout the study duration of 52 weeks. However, the limited sample 
size is too small to draw any final conclusions regarding the actual frequency of ADA following SB12 
treatment, and it cannot be excluded that neutralising antibodies may occur after more patients have 
been treated. 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
In the Phase I study, there were no notable differences in the safety profile of SB12 and the reference 
product. In the Phase III study, some imbalances may indicate a worse safety profile for SB12, while 
others would suggest otherwise. Due to the obvious limitations of the design and conduct of the study, 
it appears likely that these are chance findings. Although data on immunogenicity are very limited, no 
clinical concern is raised.

3.  Biosimilarity assessment 
3.1.  Comparability exercise and indications claimed 
The  claimed  therapeutic  indication  for  the  treatment  of  PNH  is the  same  as for  the  reference  product 
Soliris: 
Epysqli is indicated in adults and children for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria 
(PNH). 
Evidence  of  clinical  benefit  is  demonstrated  in  patients  with  haemolysis  with  clinical  symptom(s) 
indicative of high disease activity, regardless of transfusion history (see section 5.1). 
Soliris  is  also  indicated  in  the  treatment  of  atypical  haemolytic  uremic  syndrome  (aHUS),  refractory 
generalised myasthenia gravis (gMG) in patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody-
positive, and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), but these indications are still protected 
by orphan exclusivity and not applied for in this MAA.  
Summary of quality comparability data 
A comprehensive similarity exercise following the general principles outlined in the guideline on similar 
biological medicinal products containing biotechnology-derived proteins as active substance; Quality 
issues (EMA/CHMP/BWP/247713/2012) has been performed. Throughout the SB12 development 
program, EU Soliris was used as the reference product in quality exercises and clinical studies while US 
Soliris was inevitably used in clinical phase III study.  
In order to support a determination that SB12 is highly similar to EU Soliris and to establish a scientific 
bridge between EU Soliris and US Soliris, a three-way comparison was performed at quality level 
between SB12, EU and US Soliris. 
Summary of nonclinical comparability data 
The pharmacology program was focused on primary PD. A series of in vitro PD studies was performed 
to assess any potential differences in biological activity between SB12 and EU or US Soliris. Given that 
SB12 is developed as a proposed biosimilar, secondary PD, safety pharmacology and PD drug 
interaction studies were not deemed necessary, which is in accordance with EMA guideline 
[EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010]. Toxicological in vivo studies were not performed. 
The clinical development plan consists of two studies:  
Clinical Phase I study (SB12-1001) was the pivotal PK similarity study. This was a double-blind, three-
arm, parallel group, and single-dose study to demonstrate similarity in PK, safety, tolerability, 
immunogenicity, and PD between SB12 and Soliris. A total of 240 healthy subjects aged 18-55 years 
were enrolled and randomised in a ratio of 1:1:1 to receive a 300 mg single dose IV of either SB12, EU 
sourced Soliris, or US sourced Soliris.  
The design of the clinical study has been discussed in EMA Scientific Advice, which was largely adhered 
to, except the recommended exclusion of female participants and the use of the functional CH50 assay 
for PD assessment. 
Clinical Phase III study (SB12-3003) aimed to confirm clinical equivalence between SB12 and Soliris in 
a representative indication. This was a randomized, double-blinded, multicentre, cross-over study to 
compare the efficacy, safety, PK, and immunogenicity in patients with PNH between SB12 and Soliris. 
A total of 50 subjects were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to treatment sequence I (SB12 to Soliris) or

switched to receive Soliris and subjects who were randomised to initially receive Soliris were switched 
to receive SB12 at Week 26. Study drug was given according to the posology of Soliris until Week 50 
(4 x 600 mg weekly, followed by 900 mg bi-weekly). 
EMA Scientific Advice was followed concerning enrolment of a treatment-naïve study population, as 
well as primary (LDH levels) and secondary (LDH profile over time, number of pRBC transfusions) 
efficacy endpoints. The equivalence range and time point for the primary assessment have not been 
conclusively discussed. The cross-over design including an IP switch after 26 Weeks was strongly 
discouraged as this would hamper adequate interpretation/comparison of long term safety and 
immunogenicity data. 
3.2.  Results supporting biosimilarity 
Quality 
A comprehensive and well-established biosimilarity exercise has been conducted. EU-sourced RMP lots 
and US-sourced comparators lots have been included into the similarity exercise and compared against 
several produced batches of Epysqli. These Epysqli batches were comprised of  PPQ DP, clinical DP and 
PPQ DS batch. DP batches included into the biosimilarity exercise were manufactured from 
independent DS batches. The number of RMP lots (and comparator lots for the 3-way comparison) is 
agreed as it forms a solid basis for evaluation of the variability in quality attributes of RMP. 
A broad panel of standard and state-of-the-art methods has been applied for similarity evaluation and 
addresses all relevant physicochemical and biological characteristics of the eculizumab molecule. In 
principle, the results support the applicant’s conclusion that similarity for the relevant physicochemical 
and biological quality attributes has been demonstrated. For the majority of the compared quality 
attributes the data for Epysqli were within the pre-established similarity ranges. Slight differences 
detected in N-glycosylation, oxidation, deamidation, and charged variants have been appropriately 
addressed and do not raise any doubts on the biosimilarity claim. In addition to comprehensive and 
state-of-the-art characterisation study, comparative stress stability studies, performed for SB12, EU 
and US Soliris to assess similarity in terms of degradation profiles, support the biosimilarity claim. 
Results of all comparative stability studies showed similar degradation profiles supporting similarity 
across SB12, EU and US Soliris. 
Nonclinical 
Comparative in vitro studies to evaluate similarity between Epysqli and EU/US Soliris with regard to 
biological properties were conducted and generally showed similar biological properties between both 
products. Additional biological properties of SB12 (e.g. C5 binding by SPR (surface plasmon 
resonance), Fcγ receptors, C1q binding, C5 polymorphic variants binding) were also compared to 
EU/US Soliris in side-by-side analyses. Study reports of those studies were submitted in Module 3 of 
the dossier and were thus assessed and discussed in detail in the Quality section of the assessment 
report.  
Clinical data 
Pharmacokinetics 
Phase I study SB12-1001 
Biosimilarity in pharmacokinetics of SB12 and Soliris was shown in healthy volunteers in the single-
dose Phase I study SB12-1001. The geometric LSMean ratio (90% CI) for SB12 and EU sourced Soliris 
Assessment report  
EMA/203468/2023  
Page 120/129 
 
 
 
 
in AUCinf was 0.991 (0.9541 to 1.0285), for SB12 and US sourced Soliris 0.951 (0.9140 to 0.9904), 
and for EU sourced Soliris and US sourced Soliris 0.960 (0.9216 to 1.0010), which were all within the 
pre-defined equivalence margin of 0.8 to 1.25. Thus, the primary endpoint of the study was met. 
In addition, summary statistics of the other PK parameters revealed that most of the PK parameters, 
such as AUClast, Cmax, Vz, CL and t1/2 were similar among the three treatment groups. 
The profiles for mean terminal complement activity among SB12, EU-sourced Soliris and US-sourced 
Soliris group were also similar, supporting PD similarity. 
Phase III study SB12-3003 
The mean (SD) eculizumab Ctrough at Week 26 was 150.041 (62.6232) μg/mL in the Soliris group and 
133.807 (71.6412) μg/mL in the SB12 group. At Week 52 mean (SD) eculizumab Ctrough levels were 
127.102 (60.2749) μg/mL (Soliris) and 129.084 (52.5487) μg/mL (SB12). Hence, eculizumab levels 
appeared similar with overlapping SD bars. 
Clinical Efficacy (Phase III study SB12-3003) 
The primary efficacy analysis was performed for the PPS-single using a linear model with treatment 
and gender as fixed effects. In the PPS-single, the 2-sided 95% CI of the estimated LSM difference in 
LDH level at Week 26 between SB12 and Soliris treatment group (SB12 − Soliris: 34.48, 95% CI 
[−47.66, 116.62]) completely lied within the pre-defined equivalence margin of [−337.2 to 337.2]. 
In the M-FAS, using multiple imputation method that assumed missing data were MAR, the 2-sided 
95% CI of the estimated LSM difference in LDH (U/L) level at Week 26 between SB12 and Soliris 
treatment groups (SB12 − Soliris: 26.91, 95% CI [−56.24, 110.05]) also completely lied within the 
pre-defined equivalence margin. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints: 
The mean LDH profile over time indicated a marked decrease 2 weeks after treatment initiation and 
appeared similar between treatment arms when plotted by treatment sequence. 
The overall units of pRBC transfused were decreased after study treatment initiation in both planned 
treatment sequences to a similar extent. 
Other efficacy results: 
The primary efficacy endpoint for FDA, the estimated ratio of geometric LSM in time-adjusted AUEC of 
LDH from Week 14 to Week 26 and from Week 40 to Week 52 between SB12 and Soliris treatment 
groups (SB12/Soliris) was 1.08, and the 2-sided 90% CI of [0.95, 1.23] was within the pre-defined 
equivalence range [0.77 to 1.29], according to the applicant.  
Mean proportions of PNH clone size of RBC were increased at Week 26 and remained increased up to 
Week 52 in both treatment groups. Mean haptoglobin increased in both treatment groups at Week 26, 
slightly decreased up to Week 52, but remained clearly above baseline levels. Opposite trends were 
observed in mean free haemoglobin levels, suggesting similar effects of eculizumab on disease-related 
laboratory parameters in both treatment groups. 
A trend of mean reduction from baseline in severity scores (0-10 scale) for PNH-related symptoms 
(fatigue, haemoglobinuria, chest pain, abdominal pain, dyspnoea, dysphagia, erectile dysfunction) was 
observed at Week 26 and Week 52 in both treatment groups.

Clinical Safety 
Phase I study SB12-1001 
The safety profile of SB12 and Soliris was highly similar in healthy subjects in the single-dose 
Phase I study SB12-1001. The proportion of subjects with any AEs and TEAEs was similar among the 
groups. Most of the TEAEs were mild or moderate. The proportion of subjects with any AESI was low 
and comparable among the treatment groups. The proportion of subjects with SAEs was low and 
comparable among the treatment groups (each 1 event in the SB12 and US-Soliris group). 
The number of subjects with ADAs throughout the study was small, with only three subjects having a 
post-dose ADA positive result. Two of the positive ADA subjects were in the SB12 treatment group and 
one in the EU-sourced Soliris group. There were no ADA positive subjects in the US-sourced Soliris 
group. All of the positive ADA subjects had a negative NAb result. 
Phase III study SB12-3003 
During Period 1, the number of subjects reporting any TEAEs was comparable between treatment 
arms. COVID-19 infections were observed at similar frequencies between study arms during Period 1. 
Overall, the majority of TEAEs were of Grade 1 or Grade 2. Serious TEAEs were reported at similar 
frequencies, 3 in 3/47 (6.4%) subjects in the SB12 treatment group and 3 serious TEAEs in 2/47 
(4.3%) subjects in the Soliris treatment group. No ADA or NAb were detected throughout the study 
duration of 52 weeks. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about biosimilarity 
Quality 
None.  
NonClinical 
None.  
Clinical data 
The terminal complement complex ELISA was used as a PD endpoint in both the Phase I and Phase III 
trial. The initially proposed and endorsed CH50 was not included. This is not regarded optimal. The 
inclusion of CH50 as a secondary PD endpoint would have provided further valuable information and 
support for the Phase III study. Due to the small Phase III study, from which only limited data 
regarding efficacy, safety, PK and PD can be expected, it would have been even more important to 
retrieve as much information as possible from the Phase I study in order to provide a conclusive 
biosimilarity exercise. Thus, it is not considered optimal that important PD data, such as CH50, have 
not been evaluated in this study. 
Phase I study SB12-1001 
It is not considered optimal that only total eculizumab levels have been measured for the evaluation of 
PK characteristics. The measurement of free eculizumab concentrations could have provided additive 
data in support for the demonstration of biosimilarity. Although this is not regarded optimal, a request 
at this point in time would not be regarded fruitful. Therefore, no concern is raised. 
Phase III study SB12-3003 
As no equivalence range has been pre-defined for PK evaluation in study SB12-3003, only descriptive 
statistics are available. Eculizumab Ctrough concentrations were consistently lower in the SB12 group 
Assessment report  
EMA/203468/2023  
Page 122/129 
 
 
 
compared to Soliris throughout Period 1 (mean 150.041 μg/mL in the Soliris group and 133.807 μg/mL 
in the SB12 group at Week 26). Eculizumab levels over time were also lower for SB12 at most time 
points during Period 2 compared to Soliris.  
Furthermore, it appears that reduction of terminal complement activity is lower in patients treated with 
SB12 compared to Soliris. 
Clinical Efficacy (Phase III study SB12-3003) 
Primary efficacy endpoint: 
At Week 26, the LSM of LDH was higher in the SB12 group (284.20 U/L) compared to Soliris (249.72 
U/L). Although formally the primary efficacy endpoint met pre-defined criteria to show biosimilarity, 
the low specificity of LDH, questionable clinical irrelevance of the equivalence margin, and likely not 
optimal time point of primary assessment in the study population represent remaining uncertainties. 
Secondary endpoints: 
The number of events of elevated LDH levels > 2 x ULN and exposure-adjusted event rates (EAER) 
were higher in patients on SB12 treatment during both treatment periods. 
Other efficacy results: 
The geometric LSM in time-adjusted AUEC of LDH from Week 14 to Week 26 and from Week 40 to 
Week 52 was higher for SB12 (279.65 U/L) compared to Soliris (258.73 U/L). 
The mean LDH at Week 26 was higher in the SB12 treatment group (402.6 U/L) compared to Soliris 
(260.2 U/L). At Week 52, after the planned switch, mean LDH was again higher in patients receiving 
SB12 (431.9 U/L) compared to Soliris (317.7 U/L). 
The mean reduction from baseline in haemoglobinuria severity scores was more pronounced during 
Soliris treatment compared to SB12 treatment in both periods (sequence I: 3.1 at baseline, 0.8 
(Soliris) at Week 26, 1.0 (SB12) at Week 52; sequence II: 3.4 at baseline, 1.1 (SB12) at Week 26, 0.6 
(Soliris) at Week 52]. 
Breakthrough haemolysis: 
TEAEs related to BTH were reported more frequently in more subjects in the SB12 treatment group [22 
TEAEs in 8/47 (17.0%) subjects vs 3 TEAEs in 1/47 (2.1%) subject in the Soliris treatment group] 
across both treatment periods, which may indicate a potential reduced efficacy of SB12. The applicant 
provided possible confounding factors, i.e. dose delays, which partially explain this imbalance. 
Clinical Safety 
Phase III study SB12-3003 
In Period 2, 8/23 (34.8%) subjects in the Soliris treatment arm had an unplanned IP switch. Hence, 
the safety data set for patients receiving Soliris in Period 2 is considerably reduced.  
During Period 1 more subjects reported ≥ Grade 3 TEAEs in the Soliris treatment arm [3/25 (12%)] 
compared to SB12 [1/24 (4.2%)]. Treatment-related events were also reported more frequently in the 
Soliris group [6/25 (24.0%) compared to the SB12 group [3/24 (12.5%], as were AESI in the Soliris 
group [3/25 (12%); vs 0/24 (0%) in the SB12 group]. 
During the whole study duration, the overall frequency of ≥ Grade 3 TEAEs was higher while on SB12 
treatment [6/47 (12.8%)] compared to Soliris [2/47 (4.3%)]. Similarly, COVID-19 related TEAEs were 
more frequently reported in patients during SB12 treatment [8/47 (17.0%)] compared to Soliris [3/47 
(6.4%)]. 
Assessment report  
EMA/203468/2023  
Page 123/129 
 
 
 
During the whole study duration, the incidences of the most frequent TEAEs by SOC and PT were 
higher in the SB12 group compared to the Soliris group (corona virus infection, haemoglobinuria, 
diarrhoea, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased, hypertension), except headache, which was more 
frequent in the Soliris group. 
Adequate interpretation/comparison of long term safety and immunogenicity data is compromised due 
to the cross-over design, which was strongly discouraged during EMA Scientific Advice. 
3.4.  Discussion on biosimilarity 
Quality 
A well-established biosimilarity exercise has been conducted, which confirms similarity of SB12 with its 
reference product EU Soliris. 
Nonclinical 
Comparative in vitro studies support the biosimilarity of SB12 versus the Soliris EU. 
Clinical 
In clinical Phase I study SB12-1001 conducted in healthy volunteers, PK biosimilarity was formally 
demonstrated between SB12, EU-sourced Soliris and US-sourced Soliris. For the primary PK parameter 
AUCinf, the 90% CI for the ratio of test/reference product fell within the acceptance range of 80.00-
125.00%. This was supported by similar summary statistic of other PK parameters in this study and 
similar Cthrough levels between SB12 and Soliris in the Phase III study SB12-3003. 
Terminal complement activity was measured as PD marker in Phase I and Phase III studies. Although 
the assessment of this marker pointed towards similar PD among SB12, EU-sourced Soliris and US-
sourced Soliris in healthy volunteers in the Phase I study, it is not considered optimal that CH50 has 
not been included as PD marker in both the Phase I and Phase III study. This would have provided 
further valuable information regarding PD similarity of the test and reference product. Thus, the 
conclusions on PD similarity are considered limited. 
In clinical Phase III study SB12-3003, the primary endpoint LDH levels at Week 26 supports 
biosimilarity, as the 95% CI for the LSM difference between SB12 and Soliris completely lied within the 
pre-defined equivalence margin. As already highlighted during Scientific Advice, the use of LDH as 
primary endpoint has its limitations, as measuring LDH levels is considered to have low specificity. 
Moreover, in a treatment-naïve study population, an earlier time point for LDH evaluation may have 
been more appropriate, as the reduction in LDH levels has already reached the plateau at Week 26. 
Although the clinical irrelevance of the proposed equivalence margin is questionable, confirmation on 
biosimilarity is provided from the narrow 95% CI of the primary efficacy endpoint and similar results 
from secondary endpoints LDH profile over time and pRBC units transfused.  
Due to the inevitable limitations of LDH as primary endpoint, the importance of clinical pharmacology 
outcomes to demonstrate biosimilarity has been highlighted. In the Phase I study SB12-1001 
biosimilarity regarding PK was adequately demonstrated in healthy volunteers.  
A considerably higher proportion of subjects with TEAEs related to breakthrough haemolysis [22 TEAEs 
in 8/47 (17.0%) subjects vs 3 TEAEs in 1/47 (2.1%) subject in the Soliris treatment group] raised 
concerns regarding a potentially reduced efficacy of SB12. Although several flaws in study design and 
conduct hamper adequate interpretation of results, the marked difference concerning breakthrough 
haemolysis is consistent across both study periods.  
Assessment report  
EMA/203468/2023  
Page 124/129 
 
 
 
Confounding factors were proposed by the applicant, which partially explain the higher incidence of 
breakthrough haemolysis in patients treated with SB12. These include dose delays of ≥ 17 days 
(confounding factor #1), which were caused by COVID-19 infections during local outbreaks and 
occurred more frequently during SB12 treatment. Elevated LDH levels or BTH events may also be 
caused by dose delays of 15 or 16 days (confounding factor #2) that result in a lower eculizumab 
exposure, which is manageable by a narrower dosing interval for affected patients, and are therefore 
of no concern.  
The clinical data regarding safety is limited and can only provide supportive information on 
comparability of safety and immunogenicity. In the Phase I study conducted in 240 healthy volunteers, 
the safety profiles of SB12, EU-sourced Soliris and US-sourced Soliris was very similar, with similar 
proportion of subjects with AEs and TEAEs. The number of subjects with ADAs was low and also 
comparable among the groups. Thus, no concerns regarding different safety profiles arise from this 
study. 
However, in Phase III study SB12-3003, in addition to the already very limited sample size (n=49), 
adequate interpretation/comparison of long term safety and immunogenicity data is even more 
compromised due to the cross-over design, which was strongly discouraged during EMA Scientific 
Advice. Different N-glycan patterns between SB12 and Soliris have been identified, but concluded to 
have no impact on efficacy and safety. From the reference product it is known that eculizumab has low 
immunogenic potential (infrequent and low antibody titre responses and no neutralising antibodies 
were observed, see EPAR and PI Soliris). During the clinical development of SB12 there were only few 
subjects in the phase I study developing antibodies, of whom no subject had neutralizing antibodies. 
The patient population included in the phase III study was treatment-naïve and can therefore be 
considered a sensitive population for detecting the occurrence of immunogenicity, albeit the overall 
number of subjects was low. Therefore, no issue was raised from a clinical perspective.  
3.5.  Extrapolation of safety and efficacy 
Soliris is currently indicated for the treatment of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria 
(PNH), atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), generalised myasthenia gravis (gMG), and 
neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). The applicant has provided a justification for 
extrapolation to other indications. However, as with the current marketing authorisation the applicant 
only claims PNH, no assessment of the justification for extrapolation will be done at the very moment. 
The applicant is asked to provide these data during future variation procedures, when extension of 
indication is sought for. 
3.6.  Additional considerations  
It should be noted that the manufacturing process for drug substance and drug product has been 
changed after conduct of the clinical studies meaning that the PPQ and intended commercial material is 
derived from a process version, which slightly differs from the clinical process. A sound comparability 
exercise to demonstrate a comparable quality profile of material from the different process versions 
was performed. Comparability between drug substance materials and drug product derived from the 
different process versions could be demonstrated. Some minor issues identified during the initial 
assessment were sufficiently addressed.  
3.7.  Conclusions on biosimilarity and benefit risk balance 
Based on the review of the submitted data, Epysqli is considered biosimilar to Soliris. Therefore, a 
Assessment report  
EMA/203468/2023  
Page 125/129 
 
 
 
benefit/risk balance comparable to the reference product can be concluded. 
Divergent position is appended to this report. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Epysqli is not similar to Aspaveli within the meaning of 
Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000.  
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by majority 
decision that the benefit-risk balance of Epysqli is favourable in the following indication: 
SB12 is indicated in adults and children for the treatment of Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria 
(PNH). Evidence of clinical benefit is demonstrated in patients with haemolysis with clinical symptom(s) 
indicative of high disease activity, regardless of transfusion history (see section 5.1). 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use

5.  Appendix - Divergent position to the majority 
recommendation 
DIVERGENT POSITION DATED 30 March 2023 
Epysqli EMEA/H/C/006036/0000 
The undersigned members of the CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s positive opinion recommending 
the granting of the marketing authorisation for the biosimilar Epysqli (eculizumab, reference product: 
Soliris) for the following indication: 
Epysqli is indicated in adults and children for the treatment of: 
- 
Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) 
Evidence of clinical benefit is demonstrated in patients with haemolysis with clinical symptom(s) 
indicative of high disease activity, regardless of transfusion history (see section 5.1). 
The reasons for divergent opinion were the following: 
In study SB12-3003, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) related to breakthrough haemolysis 
(BTH) were reported more frequently and in more subjects in the Epysqli treatment group than in the 
Soliris treatment group [22 TEAEs in 8/47 (17.0%) subjects vs 3 TEAEs in 1/47 (2.1%) subject in the 
Soliris treatment group]. While the observed imbalance in BTH events may be partly explained by 
differences in the frequency of dose delays ≥17 days between treatment groups, related to local 
COVID-19 outbreaks, dose delays of 15 or 16 days occurred at similar frequencies between the 
treatment groups and are thus not considered to be a strong confounding factor. After removing BTH 
events due to dose delays ≥17 days, the remaining imbalance between treatment groups is still 
concerning [12 TEAEs in 6/47 (13%) subjects in Epysqli vs 0 TEAEs in 0/47 (0%) subjects in Soliris]. 
Since the marked imbalance in BTH events occurred in both study periods of this cross-over study, and 
even recurred upon re-challenge after unplanned IP switch back to Epysqli in one subject, it appears 
independent of study participant characteristics. Furthermore, all BTH events involved 
haemoglobinuria, which is a major symptom of PNH, and may be indicative for a true lower efficacy of 
Epysqli compared to Soliris. Furthermore, although the primary endpoint, LDH levels at Week 26, has 
formally been met, the equivalence margin of [−337.2 to 337.2] and timepoint are considered 
questionable and lack sound clinical justification. The primary endpoint is thus not considered to 
provide reassurance on similar efficacy. Moreover, the number of events of elevated LDH levels > 2 x 
ULN was also higher in patients on SB12 treatment, again during both treatment periods adding 
further support for suspected lower efficacy based on LDH level data. 
The applicant has not provided a convincing alternative explanation for the observed imbalance in 
TEAEs of BTH and this raises major concerns about the conclusion on biosimilarity. In view of the 
above considerations, the undersigned delegates consider that biosimilarity of Epysqli and the 
reference product Soliris has not been conclusively demonstrated.

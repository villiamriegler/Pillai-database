Scientific conclusions  
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for Eylea, the scientific conclusions of 
PRAC are as follows:  
Following a signal for “blindness” and “visual acuity (VA) reduced” identified in August 2013 a 
cumulative review was submitted by the Marketing Authorisation Holder. The assessment of this 
signal has confirmed a causal relationship with aflibercept for intravitreal injection. The PRAC 
therefore considers that “blindness” and “visual acuity reduced” should be added in the section 4.8 
of the SmPC.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Eylea, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance AFLIBERCEPT is favourable subject 
to the proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.

2.  Scientific discussion
2.1.  Problem statement
2.1.1.  Disease or condition
The claimed indication for is: Apretude is indicated in combination with safer sex practices for pre-
exposure prophylaxis to reduce the risk of sexually acquired HIV-1 infection in at-risk individuals 
weighing at least 35 kg (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
The HIV pandemic remains a public health emergency with an estimated annual 1.5 million incident 
infections worldwide in 2020 [UNAIDS, 2021a]. Although the annual number of infections has been 
decreasing on a global scale with a 30% decline since 2010, new infections continue to occur despite 
Assessment report 
EMA/360205/2023 
Page 10/150
advances in the development of ART for HIV treatment and data demonstrating that individuals with 
undetectable HIV-1 viral load do not transmit virus to uninfected partners [Cohen, 2016; UNAIDS, 
2021b].
In 2020, the largest proportion of newly diagnosed HIV infections occurred in East and Southern Africa 
(ESA) with 730,000 incident infections, which accounted for 42.9% of all new infections, followed by 
Asia and Central Pacific and West and Central Africa, which accounted for 17.7% and 14.1% of total 
new infections, respectively. Although the geographic regions listed above accounted for the majority 
of new HIV infections in 2020, they also reported significant declines in HIV incidence in the last 
decade [UNAIDS, 2021c]. 
However, HIV incidence has increased steadily over the past decade in 3 regions: Eastern Europe and 
Central Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East and North Africa, which accounted for 10%, 7.1%, 
and 1.1% of new HIV infections in 2020, respectively.
Populations disproportionately affected by the ongoing HIV pandemic vary by region. Sixty two percent 
of incident HIV infections in 2019 were among specific subsets of the population at elevated risk for 
HIV acquisition, including sex workers, persons who inject drugs, prisoners, transgender people, and 
MSM and their sexual partners [UNAIDS, 2020].
Ten percent of total HIV incident infections occurred among people who inject drugs, a population that 
accounted for a disproportionately large share of new infections in eastern Europe and Central Asia 
(48%) and in the Middle East and North Africa (43%). 2% of new infections in 2019 occurred among 
TGW [UNAIDS, 2021c].
In the US, where approximately 38,000 new infections are diagnosed per year, MSM accounted for 
69% of newly diagnosed infections in 2018 [CDC, 2020]. 
Sub-Saharan Africa, particularly ESA, continues to carry the greatest HIV burden in the world. 
Cisgender women accounted for 48% of all newly diagnosed HIV infections among adults over 15 years 
of age in 2019; however, this figure was as high as 58% in West and Central Africa and 61% in ESA 
(compared to 21% in West/Central Europe and North Africa) [UNAIDS, 2021c]. 
Outside of sub-Saharan Africa, men represented more than half of newly diagnosed HIV infections in 
2019, from 57% in the Caribbean to 79% in West/Central Europe and North America [UNAIDS, 
2021c]. Also in 2019, almost a quarter (23%) of new infections globally occurred among MSM. This 
population accounted for a large proportion of total HIV infections in Asia and Central Pacific (44%), 
Latin America (44%), and West/Central Europe and North America (64%) [UNAIDS, 2020].
2.1.3.   Aetiology and pathogenesis
HIV can be transmitted via the exchange of a variety of body fluids from infected people, such as 
blood, breast milk, semen and vaginal secretions. HIV can also be transmitted from a mother to her 
child during pregnancy, delivery and breastfeeding. 
Behaviours and conditions that put individuals at greater risk of contracting HIV include:



-having condomless anal or vaginal sex;
-having another sexually transmitted infection (STI) such as syphilis, herpes, chlamydia, 
gonorrhoea and bacterial vaginosis;
-engaging in harmful use of alcohol and drugs in the context of sexual behaviour;
Assessment report 
EMA/360205/2023 
Page 11/150



-sharing contaminated needles, syringes and other injecting equipment and drug solutions when 
injecting drugs;
-receiving unsafe injections, blood transfusions and tissue transplantation, and medical procedures 
that involve unsterile cutting or piercing; and
-experiencing accidental needle stick injuries, including among health workers.
Individuals can reduce the risk of HIV infection by limiting exposure to risk factors. Key approaches for 
HIV prevention, which are often used in combination, include:





-male and female condom use;
-prevention, testing and counselling for HIV and STIs;
-use of antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) for prevention (oral PrEP and long acting products), the 
dapivirine vaginal ring;
-harm reduction for people who inject and use drugs; and
-elimination of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV.
HIV is not transmitted if a person’s sexual partner is on effective ART and virally suppressed, so 
increasing access to testing and supporting linkage to ART is an important component of HIV 
prevention.
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
The intended benefit of PrEP is the prevention of HIV infection. The symptoms of HIV vary depending 
on the stage of infection. Though people living with HIV tend to be most infectious in the first few 
months after being infected, many are unaware of their status until the later stages. In the first few 
weeks after initial infection, people may experience no symptoms or an influenza-like illness including 
fever, headache, rash or sore throat.
As the infection progressively weakens the immune system, they can develop other signs and 
symptoms, such as swollen lymph nodes, weight loss, fever, diarrhoea and cough. Without treatment, 
they could also develop severe illnesses such as tuberculosis (TB), cryptococcal meningitis, severe 
bacterial infections, and cancers such as lymphomas and Kaposi's sarcoma.
HIV can be diagnosed through rapid diagnostic tests that provide same-day results. This greatly 
facilitates early diagnosis and linkage with treatment and care. People can also use HIV self-tests to 
test themselves. However, no single test can provide a full HIV positive diagnosis; confirmatory testing 
is required, conducted by a qualified and trained health or community worker at a community centre or 
clinic. 
Most widely-used HIV diagnostic tests detect antibodies produced by the person as part of their 
immune response to fight HIV. In most cases, people develop antibodies to HIV within 28 days of 
infection. During this time, people experience the so-called window period – when HIV antibodies have 
not been produced in high enough levels to be detected by standard tests and when they may have 
had no signs of HIV infection, but also when they may transmit HIV to others. After infection without 
treatment and viral suppression, an individual may transmit HIV transmission to a sexual or drug-
sharing partner or for pregnant women to their infant during pregnancy, delivery or the breastfeeding 
period.

2.1.5.  Management
PrEP is a key component of the overall strategy to reduce the number of new HIV infections in the US 
as outlined in the Department of Health and Human Services Ending the HIV Epidemic [HHS, 2019], 
the US National HIV/AIDS Strategies initiatives [ONAP, 2015], and the WHO Policy Brief on expanding 
recommendations for oral PrEP for HIV infection [WHO, 2015].
The current standard of care for HIV PrEP in the EU includes the tenofovir-based, fixed dose 
antiretroviral combination regimen, TDF/FTC, to be orally administered daily:
-TDF/FTC was approved for HIV-1 PrEP by the US FDA in July 2012 and subsequently approved in 
other countries, including the EU and Canada. TDF/FTC is indicated for use in at-risk adults and 
adolescents (≥35 kg) to reduce the risk of sexually acquired HIV-1, when used in combination with 
safer sex practices.
However, the use of daily oral tenofovir-based PrEP regimens for PrEP has limitations. Oral PrEP 
efficacy requires adherence to daily dosing regimen.
In a systematic review of randomized clinical trials of oral PrEP versus placebo or no oral PrEP, 
adherence rate of >70% to oral PrEP was associated with 73% effectiveness in the reduction of new 
HIV-1 infections, while adherences between >40% to <70% or <40% were associated with 
effectiveness rates of 49% and 7%, respectively [Chou, 2019].
Clinical trials have demonstrated that oral PrEP efficacy is strongly correlated with adherence in key 
population groups including:

-MSM and TGW: Of the 22 HIV infections in the DISCOVER study, 5 were likely infected at study 
entry; excluding these 5 participants, 15 out of 17 (88%) had low (i.e., taking <2 doses/week) or 
undetectable tenofovir diphosphate concentrations in dried blood spots on the day of HIV diagnosis 
[Mayer, 2020]. In the iPrEX study, low drug exposure was associated with the majority of incident 
HIV infections; of the 34 participants with incident HIV infection in the TDF/FTC group, at least 1 
study drug component was detected in any plasma or cell specimen from 3 participants [Grant, 
2010].

Cisgender women: The FEM-PrEP study was stopped early due to lack of efficacy attributable to low 
drug adherence; less than 40% of the HIV-uninfected women in the TDF/FTC group had evidence 
of recent pill use at visits that were matched to the HIV-infection window for women with 
seroconversion [Van Damme, 2012]. Similarly, all tenofovir-based regimens assessed in the VOICE 
trial failed to significantly reduce the risk of HIV acquisition, and the lack of efficacy was associated 
with low adherence as assessed by measurement of tenofovir levels in plasma [Marrazzo, 2015].
Among 15 EU countries that were able to report gender- and transmission-disaggregated data on PrEP 
utilization, over 90% of current PrEP users identified as MSM as of March 2019, and it has been 
estimated that approximately 500,000 MSM who would be very likely to use PrEP are unable to access 
it [ECDC, 2019; Hayes, 2019]. In Europe, PrEP is available through free public health services in only a 
select number of countries (e.g., Bosnia and Herzegovina [only Sarajevo], Croatia, Denmark, France, 
the Netherlands, Moldova, Portugal, and Ukraine) [Moseholm, 2020]. More commonly, PrEP is available 
in European countries through healthcare providers or online purchasing but not reimbursed (e.g., 
Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Lithuania, Poland, 
Russia, Serbia, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom), with PrEP users assuming 
financial responsibility. In a number of European countries, PrEP is available only through 
demonstration projects, clinical trials, or private sources such as online purchasing (e.g., Bulgaria, 
Cyprus, Greece, Romania, and Spain) [Balayan, 2021; Moseholm, 2020].

EMA/360205/2023 
Page 13/150
Although women represent approximately a third of new HIV infections in Europe, PrEP services have 
focused mostly on MSM in this region. In a recent study of 34 European countries, data showed that 
although oral PrEP was available in 30 of the countries, only 6 countries had specific PrEP 
recommendations for women [Moseholm, 2020]. Moreover, the adherence challenges to oral TDF/FTC 
PrEP in cisgender women who participated in oral PrEP studies have been described above.
Alternatives to daily oral PrEP
Apart from daily oral TDF/FTC the following PrEP regimens have been studied or approved:
Individuals who are not at ongoing risk for HIV infection can consider using “on demand” (also known 
as “intermittent,” “non-daily,” or “event-driven”) PrEP, in which an oral tenofovir-based regimen is only 
administered near the time of sex [CDC, 2021c]. This option may help to address some of the 
challenges associated with adherence to a daily dosing regimen, but efficacy is presumed to be limited 
to only those individuals who are not at continuous high risk. On-demand PrEP has only been 
evaluated in MSM, and no clinical studies have been conducted in cisgender women or TGW. 
Furthermore, this type of use is not currently included in the TDF/FTC prescribing information or in the 
CDC guidelines for PrEP, which still recommends daily PrEP for those at risk for HIV.
The dapivirine vaginal ring may provide a long-acting option for HIV-uninfected women for PrEP to 
reduce the risk of HIV-1 infection via vaginal intercourse in combination with safer sex practices when 
oral PrEP is not used, cannot be used, or is not available. The dapivirine vaginal ring 25 mg was 
assessed by the EMA as part of its coordinated efforts with the WHO to evaluate medicines not 
intended for use in the EU and was provided with a positive opinion on 23 July 2020. Two clinical 
studies, The Ring Study and ASPIRE, demonstrated a 27-31% risk reduction of HIV acquisition among 
women who used the dapivirine ring [Nel, 2016; Baeten, 2016]. Both clinical studies were followed by 
open-label extension studies, DREAM and HOPE, which illustrated an increase in use of the vaginal ring 
and a slightly higher risk reduction of approximately 50% (39% - 62%) [Nel, 2021; Baeten, 2021]. As 
a result, the WHO updated its clinical guidelines to include a conditional recommendation that the 
dapivirine vaginal ring can be offered as an additional prevention choice for women as a part of 
combination prevention strategy [WHO, 2021]. This PrEP agent is comprised of a silicone ring that is 
inserted into the vagina and slowly releases the NNRTI dapivirine; the ring must be replaced every 4 
weeks [EMA, 2020]. Although the prolonged drug exposure associated with every month dosing 
regimen may improve adherence, some of the associated risks of the inserted vaginal ring – including 
urinary tract infection, vaginal discharge, vulvovaginal pruritus, vulvovaginitis, and pelvic pain – may 
impose some limitations on acceptability. In addition, this PrEP regimen is only an option for women.

2.3.2.  Active Substance - Cabotegravir
2.3.2.1.  General information
The chemical name of cabotegravir is (3S,11aR)-N-[(2,4-difluorophenyl)methyl]-6-hydroxy-3-methyl-
5,7-dioxo-2,3,5,7,11,11a-hexahydro[1,3]oxazolo[3,2-a]pyrido[1,2-d]pyrazine-8-carboxamide. It 
corresponds to the molecular formula C19H17F2N3O5, its relative molecular mass is 405.35 and it has 
the structure shown in Figure 1.
Figure 1: cabotegravir structure
Cabotegravir appears as a white to almost white non-hygroscopic crystalline hygroscopic powder. It is 
practically insoluble below pH 9 and slightly soluble above pH 10 in aqueous media. It has two pKa, 
pKa1 = 7.7 (measured), OH group and pKa2 =11.1 (calculated), NH group.
The structure of the active substance was elucidated by a combination of 1H and 13C NMR 
spectrometry, mass spectrometry (MS), IR spectrometry, elemental analysis and single crystal X-ray 
crystallography.
Cabotegravir possesses two stereogenic centers and is the isomer with the 3S, 11aR configuration. The 
absolute stereochemistry of the active substance has been confirmed by single crystal X-ray 
crystallography.
Cabotegravir exhibits polymorphism and four solid state forms have been identified, of which only two 
are relevant to the commercial manufacturing process: Form 1 and Form 2. Form 1 was confirmed as 
Assessment report 
EMA/360205/2023 
Page 15/150
the most thermodynamically stable form at ambient conditions and is consistently produced by the 
proposed commercial manufacturing process.
2.3.2.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls
Cabotegravir is synthesized in 5 synthetic steps using well defined starting materials with acceptable 
specifications. The final crystallization step ensures the desired polymorphic form is produced.
A science and risk-based approach was applied in development of the commercial manufacturing 
process for cabotegravir consistent with ICH Q11 for the development and manufacture of active 
substances. Based on the Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) defined for the prolonged release 
suspension, the Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) of the active substance have been identified. Based 
on the CQAs for the active substance, every stage of the manufacturing process has been evaluated 
and optimized by a quality by design (QbD) approach and the use of Design of experiments (DoE). 
Design spaces, supported by multivariate experimentation, have been defined for all stages of the 
commercial manufacturing process. In combination with the input specifications, the design spaces 
represent the control strategy for cabotegravir. Critical Process Parameters (CPPs) and their target 
values or ranges are identified, as well as non-critical process parameters. The CPP ranges are within 
the ranges studied in the DoEs.
Sufficient information was presented for the verification of the proposed DSs at commercial scale. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. Potential and actual 
impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised.
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with 
regards to their origin and characterised. Rationale for impurity specifications in starting materials and 
intermediates is based on fate and purge studies. 
The active substance packaging is described. The materials comply with EU Commission Regulation No 
10/2011 for food contact use. The polyethylene used in the manufacture of the bags meets the 
compositional requirements of Ph. Eur. Section 3.1.3 Polyolefins. The antistatic additive used in the 
manufacture of the bags is not listed under Ph. Eur. 3.1.3. However, the manufactured bag material 
has been tested to, and found to comply with the test requirements of Ph. Eur. 3.1.3.
2.3.2.3.  Specification
The active substance specification includes tests for description (visual), identification (IR), solid state 
form (XRPD), cabotegravir content (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), enantiomer content (chiral HPLC), 
diastereomer content (chiral HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content (KF), bacterial endotoxins 
(Ph. Eur.) and bioburden (Ph. Eur.).
The proposed specification is acceptable. The proposed limits are in line with the relevant guidelines 
and the provided batch analyses. The limits for specified and unspecified impurities comply with ICH 
Q3A and for residual solvents with Q3C and are justified through fate and purge studies. The provided 
justification for the parameters included in the specification and those parameters not included in the 
specification is acceptable. 
There are two mutagenic impurities identified during development which have the potential to be 
present in active substance. Based on batch data, these mutagenic impurities would not be present in 
Assessment report 
EMA/360205/2023 
Page 16/150
active substance above 30% of the TTC-based acceptable limit of 16 µg/g. Consequently, neither of 
these mutagenic impurities are included on the active substance specification.
A risk assessment according to ICH Q3D has been conducted and the proposed controls for elemental 
impurities are justified.
The analytical procedures have been sufficiently described. Non-compendial analytical methods have 
been successful validated according to ICH guidance. Satisfactory information regarding the reference 
standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented.
Batch analysis data were provided for three production-scale batches of cabotegravir, which were 
manufactured according to the proposed commercial method at the commercial site and tested by the 
proposed commercial methods. In addition, as well as several representative batches used in non-
clinical and clinical studies that support the specifications and show process consistency.
2.3.2.4.  Stability
Stability data have been provided for four pilot scale batches stored under long term conditions (30 
°C/75% RH) for up to 60 months and under accelerated conditions (40 °C/75% RH) for up to 6 
months. Although higher humidity than recommended in ICH Q1A(R2) was used for the long-term 
stability studies at 30 °C, no objection is made as the higher humidity is seen as more likely to cause 
degradation. The batches were stored in the proposed commercial packaging. 
Stability batches were tested for description, assay, impurities, water content, solid state, 
diastereomer and enantiomer content. The methods are the same used for release except for the 
method for the determination of enantiomer content. The different method for enantiomer content has 
been described and fully validated and was shown to be equivalent to the method used for release 
testing.
No trends were observed in any of the provided stability batches under any of the stability conditions. 
Although control of the storage temperature is not required, the proposed storage condition “Store up 
to 30 °C” is considered acceptable.
In addition to ICH stability studies, stress studies (50 °C, 40 °C/75% RH, photostability, and freeze-
thaw cycles) were performed for one pilot batch up to three months. Photostability was conducted on a 
pilot batch, according to ICH Q1B. No significant changes were observed and the results demonstrate 
chemical and physical stability of cabotegravir under these storage conditions.
Forced degradation studies have been performed on cabotegravir to identify potential degradation 
products. Cabotegravir was chemically stable in the solid state under all stressing conditions used in 
the forced degradation study. There was no significant increase in the total degradation products under 
any solid-state stress condition. Significant degradation was only observed in solution under acidic, 
basic and oxidative conditions. However, the degradation pathways observed under solution phase 
conditions are formed under forcing conditions that are not representative of those that a solid active 
substance will experience during manufacture or storage. The results from the forced degradation 
studies demonstrate that the HPLC methods for assay, impurities, diastereomer and enantiomer 
content are stability indicating.
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier(s) is 
sufficiently stable in the proposed container. Based on the available stability data the proposed retest 
period of 60 months with storage condition “Store up to 30 °C” is acceptable.

2.3.3.  Active Substance - Cabotegravir sodium
2.3.3.1.  General information
The chemical name of cabotegravir sodium is sodium (3S,11aR)-N-[(2,4-difluorophenyl)methyl]-6-
hydroxy-3-methyl-5,7-dioxo-2,3,5,7,11,11a-hexahydro[1,3]oxazolo[3,2-a]pyrido[1,2-d]pyrazine-8-
carboxamide. It corresponds to the molecular formula C19H16F2N3NaO5, its relative molecular mass is 
427.33 and it has the structure shown in Figure 2.
Figure 2: cabotegravir sodium structure
Cabotegravir sodium appears as a white to almost white non-hygroscopic crystalline solid hygroscopic 
powder. It is practically insoluble below pH 9 and slightly soluble above pH 10 in aqueous media.
The structure of the active substance (AS) was elucidated by a combination of 1H and 13C NMR 
spectrometry, MS, IR spectrometry, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy, 
elemental analysis and single crystal X-ray crystallography.
Cabotegravir sodium possesses two stereogenic centres and is the isomer with the 3S, 11aR 
configuration. The absolute stereochemistry of the active substance is confirmed by single crystal X-
ray crystallography.
Cabotegravir sodium exhibits polymorphism. Two solid state forms that are relevant to the commercial 
manufacturing process have been identified, Form 4 and Form 3. Form 4 was confirmed as the most 
thermodynamically stable form under ambient conditions and is consistently produced by the proposed 
commercial manufacturing process. Solid state form is not impacted by micronization. A test for solid 
state form is included in the active substance specification.
2.3.3.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls
Cabotegravir sodium is manufactured using the same process as for cabotegravir but with the addition 
of salt formation and micronization steps.
Both micronized and non-micronized cabotegravir sodium packaging material has been described. 
These are the same packaging materials as used for cabotegravir.
2.3.3.3.  Specification
The active substance specification includes appropriate tests and limits for description (visual), 
identification (IR), solid state form (XRPD), cabotegravir sodium content (assay by HPLC), sodium 
content (ICP-OES), impurities (HPLC), enantiomer content (chiral HPLC), diastereomer content (chiral 
HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content (KF), and particle size (laser diffraction).
The proposed specification is acceptable. The proposed limits are in line with the relevant guidelines 
and the provided batch analyses. The limits for specified and unspecified impurities comply with ICH 
Q3A and for residual solvents to Q3C and are justified through fate and purge studies. The provided 
Assessment report 
EMA/360205/2023

justification for the parameters included in the specification and those parameters not included in the 
specification is acceptable. 
The analytical procedures have been sufficiently described. Non-compendial analytical methods have 
been successful validated according to ICH guidance. Satisfactory information regarding the reference 
standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented.
Batch analysis data were provided for three full scale and five pilot batches of micronized cabotegravir 
sodium, which were manufactured according to the proposed commercial method by the proposed 
manufacturer and micronized at each of the three proposed commercial micronization sites. In 
addition, data from another 4 batches of cabotegravir sodium (micronized), manufactured using a 
process representative of that intended for commercial manufacture and synthesized at the 
commercial site of manufacture have been provided. These batches are representative of the quality of 
the active substance that was used in clinical trials including the phase 3 study. Batches were tested 
by the proposed commercial methods or validated clinical release methods. All batches complied with 
the proposed specifications and confirm the consistency of the manufacturing process.
2.3.3.4.  Stability
Stability data for cabotegravir sodium (micronized) have been provided for five pilot scale batches 
stored under long term conditions (30 °C / 75% RH) for up to 60 months and under accelerated 
conditions (40 °C / 75% RH) for up to 6 months. The batches were stored in the intended commercial 
packaging. One batch of micronized material was also stored at 5 ± 3 °C and 50 °C, both without 
humidity control. In addition, one pilot batch of non-micronized material was stored at 30 °C / 75% RH 
(60 months), 40 °C/75% RH (6 months), 5 ± 3 °C and 50 °C, the latter two studies without humidity 
control. Although higher humidity than recommended in ICH Q1A(R2) was used for the long-term 
stability studies at 30 °C, no objection is made as the higher humidity is seen as more likely to cause 
degradation.
Stability batches were tested for description, assay, impurities, enantiomer and diastereomer content, 
water content (non-micronized cabotegravir sodium only), particle size (tested for information only for 
non-micronized cabotegravir sodium) and solid-state form. The used methods are the same as for 
release except for the methods for the determination of enantiomer content and impurities. These 
different methods have been described and fully validated and were shown to be equivalent to the 
methods used for release. No significant changes or trends were observed under any of the storage 
conditions. 
A photostability study was conducted, according to ICH Q1B, on two pilot batches of cabotegravir 
sodium (one micronized and one non-micronized). Based on the provided results, cabotegravir sodium 
requires protection from light.
A freeze/thaw study was also performed in which samples were stored for two repeated cycles 
consisting of 7 days at -20 °C followed by 7 days at 30 °C. No significant changes were observed and 
the results demonstrate chemical and physical stability of cabotegravir under these storage conditions.
Forced degradation studies were performed on cabotegravir sodium to identify potential degradation 
products that might be formed in active substance. Cabotegravir was chemically stable in the solid 
state under all stress conditions used in the forced degradation study. There was no significant 
increase in the total degradation products under any solid-state stress conditions. Significant 
degradation was only observed in solution under acidic, basic and oxidative conditions. However, the 
degradation pathways observed under solution phase conditions are formed under forcing conditions 
that are not representative of those that a solid active substance will experience during manufacture or

storage. The results from the forced degradation studies demonstrate that the HPLC methods for 
assay, impurities, diastereomer and enantiomer content are stability indicating.
Based on the available stability data the proposed retest period of 60 months with storage conditions 
“store up to 30 °C” and “protect from light” is acceptable.
2.3.4.  Finished Medicinal Product - prolonged-release suspension for 
injection
2.3.4.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development
The finished product is a prolonged release suspension for injection containing 200 mg/mL 
cabotegravir free acid, intended for intramuscular (IM) injection. It is a white to light pink, free flowing 
suspension. Each sterile, single-use glass vial of Cabotegravir Injectable Suspension is intended to 
provide a dose of 600 mg. No dilution is required prior to IM administration.
The objective of the pharmaceutical development was a suspension for injection, for long-acting drug 
delivery, stable, easily re-dispersible, at a sufficient drug load to minimize injection volume for 
intramuscular administration. 
The QTPP, and CQAs of the finished product have been established and discussed. Cabotegravir free 
acid was chosen due to its low aqueous solubility in order to achieve the desired pharmacokinetic 
performance. Cabotegravir free acid low aqueous solubility, long systemic half-life and the controlled 
particle size of the suspension allow for a finished product with long-acting drug delivery and permit 
high drug loading, which in turn minimizes injection volume required to achieve the desired exposure. 
The formulation development studies to ensure the desired finished product attributes are described. 
All excipients are widely used materials in pharmaceutical formulation and are described in Ph. Eur., 
with a long story of safe utilisation by injectable administration. Their choice was duly discussed and 
justified. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC.
The development of dissolution method has been elaborated and justified.
The development of the manufacturing process has been described in sufficient detail. 
The overfill of vials by 0.4 ml is justified since it ensures that the required dose can be extracted from 
the vial and administered. 
In-use stability of the Cabotegravir injectable suspension withdrawn into a sterile syringe has been 
demonstrated for 2 hours at room temperature. This is reflected in the in-use shelf-life stated in the 
SmPC section 6.3.
The primary packaging is a brown 3 mL type I glass vial, with bromobutyl rubber stopper and a grey 
aluminium overseal with an orange plastic flip-cap. The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC 
requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product. 
2.3.4.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls
The manufacturing process consists of 5 main steps: gamma irradiation of cabotegravir, compounding 
of excipients and subsequently, cabotegravir, wet milling, filling into vials and stoppering, and finally, 
terminal sterilisation. The process is considered to be a non-standard manufacturing process.
Assessment report 
EMA/360205/2023 
Page 20/150
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated on 3 production scale batches including 
the terminal sterilization step. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of 
producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls 
are adequate for this type of manufacturing process pharmaceutical form.
Data to support the assurance of sterility of finished product and to justify parametric release rather 
than end product sterility testing has been presented.
2.3.4.3.  Product specification
The finished product release and shelf-life specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of 
dosage form and consist of tests for description (visual), identification (HPLC, UV), cabotegravir 
content (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), impurities (HPLC), extractable volume, 
particulate contamination (Ph. Eur.), pH (Ph. Eur.), particle size (laser diffraction), dissolution 
(Ph. Eur., HPLC), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.) and sterility (Ph. Eur.). The tests and limits for both 
sets of specification are adequately justified in line with applicable guidance.
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed following a 
risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data 
was provided, demonstrating that each relevant elemental impurity was not detected above 30% of 
the respective PDE. Based on the risk assessment and the presented batch data, it can be concluded 
that no elemental impurity controls are needed in the finished product specification. 
A thorough risk evaluation concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished 
product has been submitted following a CHMP Major Objection. The risk evaluation considered all 
suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions and answers for marketing authorisation 
holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on 
nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- 
Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human 
medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the information provided, it is accepted that there 
is no risk of nitrosamine impurities in the active substance or the related finished product.
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented.
Batch analysis results are provided for 4 production scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
The product is released to the market based on the release specifications, through traditional final 
product release testing for all parameters except for sterility where parametric release has been 
justified.
2.3.4.4.  Stability of the product
Stability data from 4 production scale batches of finished product stored for up to 36 months under 
long term conditions (30 ºC / 75% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 
75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. Data are also available from batches stored 
under refrigerated conditions (5±3 ºC) for up to 36 months. The batches of medicinal product are 
representative of those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed 
for marketing. Samples were stored in both upright and inverted format.
Assessment report 
EMA/360205/2023 
Page 21/150
Samples were tested according to the shelf-life specifications. The analytical procedures used are 
stability indicating. No significant changes or trends to any of the measured parameters were 
observed. Nonetheless, given that the suspension for injection is packaged to be in direct contact with 
the rubber stopper, a risk of contamination by particles from the rubber stopper cannot be excluded. It 
is therefore recommended by the CHMP to include the control of the particulate matter contamination 
(visible particles and sub-visible particles) in the post-approval stability protocol.
Samples were also exposed to heat (50 ºC) and freeze thaw conditions. The product is stable at high 
temperature but out of specification results were seen for description, assay and particle size in the 
frozen samples.
In addition, the finished product was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability 
Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. The product is photostable.
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months without specific storage 
conditions (other than “do not freeze” as stated in the SmPC section 6.3) is acceptable.
2.3.4.5.  Adventitious agents
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used.
2.3.5.  Finished Medicinal Product – film-coated tablets
2.3.5.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development
The finished product is an immediate release film coated tablet for oral administration, containing 
cabotegravir sodium equivalent to 30 mg of cabotegravir free acid. The tablets are white film-coated, 
oval-shaped tablets, debossed with ‘SV CTV’ on one side. 
A science and risk-based approach, applying QbD and quality risk management (QRM) principles in 
accordance with ICH Q8, Q9, Q10, was used to develop the film coated tablets.
The QTPP, has established the desired quality characteristics of the finished product. The finished 
product CQAs have been identified and an understanding of the impact of the attributes of the active 
substance, excipients, container closure system and in-process materials, as well as the process 
parameters of the manufacturing process on finished product quality were established.
The active substance for the cabotegravir tablets is the sodium salt of cabotegravir which is micronized 
to meet the QTPP. Cabotegravir sodium is a BCS 2 compound The sodium salt has higher solubility 
than the free acid form ensuring oral bioavailability and appropriate pharmacokinetics. Particle size 
distribution (PSD) was studied in a human pharmacokinetics study that showed that micronized 
cabotegravir sodium gave an increased AUC and Cmax when compared to non-micronised substance.
All chosen excipients are widely used in solid oral products and the levels chosen for this product are 
within typical ranges used for tablets. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product 
formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. The choice and optimization 
of active substance crystalline form, particle size limits, the excipients, their function and quantity were 
sufficiently justified and explained.
The finished product CQAs and the input materials attributes or process parameters that determine the 
CQAs are identified. A risk assessment has been conducted and the relationship between process 
parameters and intermediate and finished product CQAs was established. Process development has 
Assessment report 
EMA/360205/2023 
Page 22/150
been conducted at commercial scale. The granulation unit operation has been identified to impact the 
CQAs. Based on the DoE, a design space was established for this step.
The development of the dissolution method has been well described. The method is considered suitable 
since it can differentiate between clinically bio-equivalent and non-bioequivalent batches.
The primary packaging consists of opaque, white HDPE bottles with polypropylene child resistant 
closures, with a polyethylene faced induction heat seal liners. The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and 
EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product.
2.3.5.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls
The manufacturing process consists of 5 main steps: blending of cabotegravir sodium with intra-
granular excipients, wet granulation, milling and drying, blending with extra-granular excipients, 
compression, and film-coating. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process.
Traditional 3-batch process validation has not been performed. Continuous process validation principles 
from the CHMP finished product process validation guideline are employed which actively monitor the 
validity of the design space. The approach is adequately documented in the process validation scheme. 
The results of qualification studies for the CQAs are presented and acceptable.
2.3.5.3.  Product specification
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form 
including description (visual), identification (HPLC, UV), uniformity of dosage units (HPLC, Ph. Eur.), 
cabotegravir content (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), dissolution (Ph. Eur., UV) and microbiological limit 
tests (Ph. Eur.).
The proposed specifications are set based on the requirements of ICH Q6A and Ph. Eur. The 
justifications provided are agreed. The limits for impurities are in line with ICH Q3B. The specifications 
are sufficiently justified and together with the manufacturing process control ensure the finished 
product quality attributes will be consistently met.
A risk assessment for elemental impurities has been conducted in accordance with ICH Q3D Option 2b, 
to evaluate the potential for elemental impurities to be present in the finished product and the relevant 
discussion has been provided. No elemental impurities were identified to be present at a level of 
greater than 30% of the PDE limit for oral administration. Based on this, no tests for elemental 
impurities are included in the finished product specification. 
A risk assessment, in line with the “Questions and answers on Information on nitrosamines for 
marketing authorisation holders” and the “Information on nitrosamines for marketing authorisation 
holders” published on the EMA website, have been presented for both the finished product 
manufacturing process and the active substance with respect to potential formation of nitrosamine 
impurities. The outcome of the risk assessment confirms that there is no risk for nitrosamine impurities 
formation.
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented.
Batch analysis results are provided for 7 production scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
Assessment report 
EMA/360205/2023

The finished product is released on the market based on the release specifications, through traditional 
final product release testing.
2.3.5.4.  Stability of the product
Stability data from three commercial scale batches of finished product manufactured by the proposed 
commercial process at the proposed site and stored for up to 48 months under long term conditions (5 
ºC, 25 ºC / 60% RH and 30 ºC / 75% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC 
/ 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. These batches were packed in the primary 
packaging proposed for marketing. Samples were tested according to the release specifications and 
using the same test methods. In addition, water content was tested according to the Karl Fisher 
method (Ph. Eur. 2.5.32). No significant changes in description, content, drug related-impurities, 
dissolution and microbial limit test were observed, and all results comply with specification. A small 
increase in the water content was observed under accelerated conditions only which had no impact on 
other product CQAs.
In addition, studies have been performed on one full-scale batch under various stressed conditions: 50 
ºC/ ambient humidity and a freeze/thaw cycle (-20 ºC/30 ºC). No significant changes to any measured 
parameters were observed.
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. The finished product is photostable.
Forced degradation studies were performed on one full-scale batch under three conditions: 80 °C for 
14 days, 80 °C/ 75 % RH for 14 days and UV-Vis light exposure (ICH Q1B conditions). No increase in 
degradation products above the ICH Q3B limit was observed and mass balance was always achieved. 
No significant changes other measured parameters were observed.
In-use stability studies were presented at the initial timepoint and after storage at the long-term 
storage condition for 49 months. The in-use stability studies were performed on one of the primary 
stability batches. No significant changes in description, assay, impurities and dissolution were 
observed. An increase in water content was observed, however this is not associated with any change 
in physical or chemical stability and has no impact on any other CQAs.
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 60 months without specific storage 
conditions as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable.
2.3.5.5.  Adventitious agents
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as 
those used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the 
use of ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the 
Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal 
products.
No other excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used.
2.3.6.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substances and finished products 
has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
Assessment report 
EMA/360205/2023 
Page 24/150
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. The major objection 
relating to the potential presence of nitrosamines was resolved by submission of a more thorough risk 
evaluation.
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the active substances and finished 
products and their manufacturing processes. Design spaces have been proposed for several steps in 
the manufacture of the active substance and for the granulation step in tablet manufacture. The design 
spaces have been adequately verified.
2.3.7.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety.
2.3.8.  Recommendation for future quality development
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation concerning the prolonged-release 
suspension for injection formulation:

The MAH is recommended to include the control of the particulate matter contamination 
(visible particles and sub-visible particles) in the post-approval stability protocol.
2.4.  Non-clinical aspects
2.4.1.  Introduction
2.4.2.  Pharmacology
2.4.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
Cabotegravir (GSK1265744 or CAB) inhibits HIV integrase by binding to the integrase active site and 
blocking the strand transfer step of retroviral Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) integration which is 
essential for the HIV replication cycle. CAB is a potent in vitro inhibitor of HIV integrase and inhibits 
the integrase catalysed viral DNA strand transfer with IC50 values in the nanomolar range (3.0 to 13 
nM).
The antiviral mechanism of CAB on HIV replication was investigated using quantitative PCR, in vitro 
passage, and direct binding dissociation studies. CAB demonstrated equivalent potency against 2 
nonnucleoside inhibitor resistant, 2 nucleoside inhibitor resistant and 2 protease inhibitor resistant 
HIV-1 mutant clones (one with 3 and one with 6 mutations) compared with the wild type strain. In 
addition, passage studies with CAB selected mutations within the integrase enzyme; some of those 
mutations recreated as site-direct mutant HIV virus conferred moderate levels of CAB resistance when 
compared to wild type virus.
The critical review of primary pharmacodynamic studies is reported in the clinical section.
Assessment report 
EMA/360205/2023 
Page 25/150
2.4.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies
The secondary pharmacology potential of CAB was evaluated for possible interactions with 16 enzyme 
assays and 65 physiological receptor and ion channel and transporter binding sites and 12 isolated 
tissue assays. CAB at 10 µM higher than free clinical Cmax following oral lead in (0.1 uM) did not 
significantly affect (defined as ≥50%) 80 of the 81 in vitro assays. The only effect greater than 50% 
was a 53% inhibition of binding in the melanocortin (MC4) receptor binding assay. The potential to 
antagonise MC4R was also observed for another integrase inhibitor dolutegravir (Tivicay) at a 
concentration equal to the clinical Cmax. The MC4R is involved notably in the regulation of energy 
homeostasis and food intake, and deficiency in the MC4R is associated with monogenic obesity. 
However, no dose-related significant effects occurred on body weight and food consumption in the 
repeat dose toxicity studies in the rat (up to 26 weeks) and monkey (up to 39 weeks), indicating the 
lack of apparent biological activity at the MC4 receptor. Additionally, no selective association of 
radioactivity with melanin was observed after single oral administration of [14C]-CAB to partially 
pigmented Lister-Hooded (see PK section). Notwithstanding, no findings associated with MC4R agonism 
or antagonism have been observed in toxicity studies with CAB, and there were no clinically significant 
patterns of changes in vital signs (weight, heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure) across the 
clinical studies. Additionally, variations in weight or appetite were generally not reported or reported as 
uncommon adverse drug reactions in any of the clinical studies and were generally similar between 
CAB and comparators. 
2.4.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme
CAB at 7.14 µg/mL (the maximum concentration limited by solubility), corresponding approx. to the 
clinical oral lead in Cmax 20 uM, caused no inhibition of hERG channel tail current in HEK-293 cells 
stably transfected with hERG cDNA. In conscious telemetered male monkeys, a CAB oral dose of 1000 
mg/kg (Cmax of 67 µg/mL; AUC0-24 1051 µg.h/mL) produced a mild, transient increase in mean 
arterial pressure (3.7 to 8.6%) and a transient increase in heart rate (16 to 23%) during the first 2 
hours after dosing. No ECG waveform or interval changes were associated with these pressure and 
heart rate changes and no effects occurred at doses of 8 and 25 mg/kg (Cmax 20.8 µg/mL; AUC0-24 
233 µg.h/mL). 
In addition, no ECG changes occurred in male or female monkeys given up to 1000 mg/kg/day for at 
least 14 consecutive days. In a thorough QTc study (mass balance study in healthy subjects) oral dose 
of CAB supratherapeutic dose of 150 mg q 12 h x 3 doses had no significant effect on cardiac 
repolarization (see clinical section). 
No respiratory effects occurred in conscious telemetered male rats in safety pharmacology studies at 
oral doses up to 300 mg/kg (Cmax of 35.8 µg/mL; AUC0-24 708 µg.h/mL). No neurobehavioral effects 
occurred in male rats on day 5 of the 14-day oral toxicity study at doses up to 300 mg/kg (Cmax of 
35.8 µg/mL; AUC0-24 708 µg.h/mL).
Overall, the exposure margins of oral CAB in safety pharmacology studies were in the range of 0-8 fold 
compared the clinical total Cmax reached with oral lead in administration.
2.4.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions
No non-clinical pharmacodynamics drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted.
The critical review of clinical studies conducted with CAB in combination with other antivirals is 
reported in the clinical section.
Assessment report 
EMA/360205/2023 
Page 26/150
2.4.3.  Pharmacokinetics
Studies have been performed to characterize the absorption, pharmacokinetics, distribution, 
metabolism and excretion of cabotegravir. In vivo studies were primarily conducted by the oral route 
and by the subcutaneous/ intramuscular routes, as these are the proposed therapeutic routes for CAB 
in humans. Also, the intravenous route was used experimentally to assess the pharmacokinetics and 
bioavailability. In vitro investigations have also been conducted to determine the binding of CAB to 
plasma proteins, its association with red blood cells, its metabolism by or interaction with cytochrome 
P450 isoenzymes, and the potential interaction with various transporters. These studies have been 
conducted in compliance with Company Divisional Standard Operating Procedures and Policies and in 
general accordance with the principles of Good Laboratory Practice (GLP). Analysis in support of the 
pivotal repeated dose toxicity studies, whole body autoradiography studies and excretion studies was 
performed in full compliance with GLP regulations and were conducted in an Organization for Economic 
and Cooperation and Development (OECD) member country in accordance with the OECD Test 
Guidelines.
The species and strains used in the present studies reflected those employed in the toxicological 
testing of CAB, to enable meaningful assessment of the exposure levels in the toxicity studies and 
provide confidence in the conclusions drawn regarding the safety of CAB in humans. The species and 
strains used were CD-1 mice, Sprague Dawley rats, partially pigmented Lister-Hooded rats, Dutch 
belted rabbits, beagle dogs and cynomolgus monkeys. 
The Applicant submitted a new PK study in minipig dated 31 May 2021: 2021N472397_00; 
GSK1265744: Investigation of the Systemic Exposure of GSK1265744 in the Male Gottingen Minipig 
Following Intramuscular Administration at a Dose Level of 1 mg/kg. The minipig PK study was only 
conducted to investigate a potentially new animal model to study additional injectable formulations for 
CAB.
Methods of analysis
CAB quantified by high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometric (HPLC-MS/MS) 
in plasma samples of mouse, rat, rabbit and monkey. The metabolic profiling of CAB was conducted by 
using chromatographic separation with radiometric detection and identification of metabolites 
performed by using LC-MS; nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods were used to confirm 
structures not confirmed by mass spectrometric methods. The bioanalytical methods are considered 
adequate. 
Absorption
Following single IV administration of CAB to dogs and monkeys, the plasma clearance (<2% of hepatic 
plasma flow) and steady-state volume of distribution (<0.35 L/kg) were low, with half-life values of 4 
to 6 hours. The sampling regimen in the rat was insufficient to characterize the pharmacokinetic 
parameters; however, the CAB concentration time profile was indicative of a lower clearance and 
longer half-life than in dogs and monkeys.
In rats and monkeys given a single SC or IM injection, CAB was slowly released from the injection site 
with a mean apparent plasma half-life ranging from 12 to 29 days (SC) or from 8 to 12 days (IM). The 
mean half-life of CAB was 76 hours following a single IM dose (1 mg/kg) to minipig. 
Following oral administration as a solution, the oral bioavailability of CAB was good (44 to 83%) and 
consistent with its high passive permeability. However, when administered as a suspension, or in solid 
dosage forms, the bioavailability appeared limited by dissolution rate or solubility which resulted in a 
less than proportional increase in systemic exposure of CAB relative to dose. In mice, rats and 
Assessment report 
EMA/360205/2023 
Page 27/150
monkeys, no consistent notable (>2-fold) difference in oral systemic exposure between sexes was 
observed.
Distribution
CAB has high passive membrane permeability, is highly protein bound and is widely distributed and 
crosses the placental barrier. The glucuronide metabolite of CAB (also referred to as CAB glucuronide, 
M1 or GSK3388352) exhibited low plasma protein binding.
The protein binding of CAB in rat, dog, monkey and human plasma and serum was high (>99%). CAB 
is a substrate for Pgp and BCRP, but due to its high permeability, no alteration in absorption would be 
expected by co-administration of either Pgp or BCRP inhibitors. After single oral administration of 
[14C]-CAB to partially pigmented Lister-Hooded rats, radioactivity was slowly absorbed and then largely 
confined to the systemic circulation albeit widely distributed to other tissues. Radiolabelled drug-
related material was minimally associated with cellular components of blood. Elimination of 
radioactivity was slow with most tissues containing low but quantifiable radioactivity at 28 days. 
Association of radioactivity to the melanin-containing tissues in the eye and skin was not observed.
Metabolism
In general, the metabolism of CAB in the nonclinical species reflects that observed in humans, with 
CAB being the principal component circulating in plasma. The major metabolite of CAB in all species 
was CAB glucuronide, which was formed primarily by UGT1A1 (with some involvement from UGT1A9) 
and was eliminated in the urine and bile. Additional studies in human (IM, SC and PO) confirmed that 
the metabolism and excretion of CAB is independent of route of administration. Metabolic conversion of 
CAB to its stereoisomers was not detected in rat, dog, monkey, or human hepatocytes, or in human 
plasma following repeat oral administration for 14 days.
The metabolism of CAB has not been investigated in the rabbit, but it has been investigated in the rat, 
the other species used for embryofoetal development investigations, and the pathways of 
biotransformation (predominately glucuronidation as indicated by CAB glucuronide in urine and bile) 
were the same as those observed in human. Although there were no disproportionate CAB metabolites 
identified that needed characterization, it is generally understood that when characterization of 
metabolite toxicity is warranted for effects on embryo-foetal development, a toxicity study in one 
species is considered sufficient (EMA/CHMP/ICH/507008/2011). It is acknowledged the lack of 
disproportionate CAB metabolites regarding human PK, and therefore the metabolism of CAB has 
sufficiently been investigated in rat and does not require further characterisation in the rabbit. 
Elimination
Across all species, elimination of drug-related material occurred predominantly via the faeces (58.5 to 
94.5% of the dose). In rodents, absorbed radioactivity as determined by the amount of drug-related 
material recovered in the urine and bile (limited to approx. 2% dose), was predominantly secreted into 
the bile while renal excretion was minimal. In monkeys, the absorbed radioactivity (approximately 
30% dose) was eliminated via both the biliary and renal routes.
In vitro data indicates that circulating CAB permeates passively into hepatocytes and is metabolized to 
CAB glucuronide which undergoes both biliary and sinusoidal excretion. Biliary excretion of CAB 
glucuronide is mediated by MRP2, while hepatic basolateral excretion into sinusoidal blood was via both 
MRP3 and MRP4. Circulating CAB glucuronide undergoes efficient renal clearance, where uptake into 
the proximal tubule is mediated by OAT3 and subsequent secretion into urine by MRP2 and MRP4, 
which would explain the minimal systemic exposure of CAB glucuronide in human.

Pharmacokinetic drug interactions
No clinical drug interaction risk was identified for co-administered substrates of CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 
2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 3A4, UGT1A1, 1A3, 1A4, 1A6, 1A9, 2B4, 2B7, 2B15, and 2B17, Pgp, BCRP, 
BSEP, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, MATE1, MATE 2-K, MRP2 or MRP4 at a clinical 
oral dose of 30 mg CAB. An additional in vitro study confirmed that CAB is not an inducer of CYP1A2 or 
CYP2B6 at concentrations from 0.03 to 30 uM in cryopreserved cultured human hepatocytes from three 
individual donors, incubated for 48 hr. 
As CAB is metabolized by UGT1A1 and a clinical study has confirmed a drug interaction with the 
UGT1A1 inducer rifampin, the co-administration of CAB with strong inducers of UGT is contraindicated. 
This potential drug interaction is stated in the SmPC.
There was no observed PK interaction between CAB and RPV when co-administered IM to rats or 
monkeys.
In a folate receptor α assay, CAB demonstrated 36.7% inhibition at 25.8 µM. The applicant presented 
resounding data showing that CAB is not a clinical inhibitor of folate transport pathways, and it was not 
predicted to elicit clinical decreases in maternal and foetal folate levels.  However, according to Foster 
et al., 2022 (https://doi.org/10.3390/ph15121533), more investigation and comprehensive data are 
needed to understand the PK, placental passage, and safety of CAB in pregnancy to confirm or refute 
the potential safety signal of neural tube birth defects observed in infants born to women receiving 
dolutegravir-based ART periconception. This is particularly relevant for PrEP indication. Currently, the 
statement in section 4.6, 
“Apretude injection is not recommended during pregnancy unless the expected benefit justifies 
the potential risk to the foetus. Cabotegravir has been detected in systemic circulation for up 
to 12 months or longer after an injection, therefore, consideration should be given to the 
potential for foetal exposure during pregnancy (see section 4.4)”
is adequate from a (non-)clinical point of view.
2.4.4.  Toxicology
2.4.4.1.  Single dose toxicity
No GLP-compliant single dose oral toxicity studies have been performed. Single dose toxicity studies 
included one GLP-compliant study in rats with administration of cabotegravir by subcutaneous or 
intramuscular injection at doses of up to 100 and 75 mg/kg, respectively. Additional studies comprised 
a set of 9 non-GLP studies with administration of cabotegravir by the oral route (mouse and 
cynomolgus monkey) or subcutaneous or intramuscular injections (rat, cynomolgus monkey) or with 
administration of cabotegravir in combination with rilpivirine (rat, intramuscular). In the non-GLP 
studies, the dose levels administered by the oral, subcutaneous and intramuscular routes were up to 
2000, 50 and 35 mg/kg, respectively. Dose levels of cabotegravir and rilpivirine employed in the study 
with the combination were of 10 and 60 mg/kg, respectively.
None of the studies revealed cabotegravir-related mortality. In the intramuscular/subcutaneous GLP-
compliant study, effects (erythema and oedema) were observed at the injection sites. In the two 
studies with oral administration (both non-GLP) effects included the observation of decreased activity 
and irregular breathing shortly after dosing in one mouse (out of 15) treated with 2000 mg/kg. No 
adverse effects were observed in cynomolgus monkey given oral doses up to 1000 mg/kg.
Assessment report 
EMA/360205/2023 
Page 29/150
2.4.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity
Repeated dose toxicity studies included 9 studies with daily oral administration and one study with 
weekly or monthly administration by subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. The studies with oral 
administration were conducted in mice, rats and cynomolgus monkeys treated during up 13, 26 and 39 
weeks, respectively. The study with subcutaneous or intramuscular injection was a 13-week study 
conducted in rats. All studies except for a 7-day study in cynomolgus monkeys were GLP-compliant. 
Endpoints evaluated in the non-GLP study were limited to clinical observations, toxicokinetics, body 
weights, haematology and clinical chemistry. In the GLP-compliant studies, in addition to conventional 
endpoints commonly evaluated in repeated dose toxicity studies, the following were included: stage-
dependent evaluation of spermatogenesis (2-week in mice, 2 and 4-week in rats, 4-week in monkeys), 
neurobehavioral assessment and hepatic P450 isoform evaluation (both in 2-week in rats), electron 
microscopy and viral serology (both in 4-week in cynomolgus monkeys). 
The test species were justified as the rodent and non-rodent species with the highest systemic 
exposure. All selected species are considered relevant from a metabolite perspective.
Cabotegravir was generally well tolerated without adverse effects in the oral repeat-dose toxicity 
studies in mice, rats and monkeys. In the 2-week toxicity study in monkeys, a high mortality was 
observed in males given 1000 mg/kg/day, which was associated with GI effects. The effects on the GI 
tract are considered due to local irritation of the compound as opposed to a systemic effect. The 39-
week study in monkeys revealed ocular findings in two monkeys - slight vascular inflammation was 
noted unilaterally near the optic nerve of a single monkey dosed with 500 mg/kg/day and inflammation 
and swelling of the optic nerve head with peripapillary oedema and diffuse corneal opacity was 
observed in a single animal dosed with 50 mg/kg/day. The applicant considers these ocular events as 
incidental.
At the end of the longest-term toxicity studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys (26-week with 
administration of up to 1000 mg/kg/day and 39-week with administration of up to 500 mg/kg/day, 
respectively), systemic exposures (AUC0-24) at the maximum tested dose (also the NOAEL) were 3203 
and 4781 µg∙hr/mL in male and female rats, respectively, and 542 and 552 µg∙hr/mL in male and 
female cynomolgus monkeys, respectively. These AUC are, approximately, 22 to 32-fold, in rats, and 
4-fold, in monkeys, the clinical AUC exposure in patients treated with oral doses of 30 mg/day.
In the study with subcutaneous or intramuscular administration - with weekly subcutaneous doses of 
100 mg/kg, monthly subcutaneous doses of up to 100 mg/kg and monthly intramuscular doses of up 
to 75 mg/kg - four high dose rats treated monthly were euthanized due to deteriorating conditions or 
found dead. The cause of moribundity or death in these animals was not linked to any underlying 
pathology findings, as none of these animals had explanatory pathology findings distinct from 
survivors. Therefore, these deaths were considered unlikely treatment-related. Besides dose-
proportional signs of redness, swelling and inflammation following subcutaneous and intramuscular 
injections at all dose levels, no additional adverse effects were noted. 
At the end of study, systemic exposures (AUC1440-2160h and AUC2016-2184h for monthly and weekly 
administrations, respectively) at the maximum tested dose (also the NOAEL) given weekly 
subcutaneously, monthly subcutaneously and monthly intramuscularly were the following in rat males 
and females (M/F): 22291/34315, 70494/116602 and 78051/107080 µg∙hr/mL, respectively. 
According to the provided calculations of margins of exposure, at the NOAEL, the AUC values in 
males/females after monthly administration by subcutaneous and intramuscular injections were, 
approximately, 37.46/61.96 and 41.47/56.90-fold, respectively, the clinical AUC0-t value in patients 
given a dose of 600 mg every 2 months by intramuscular injection.

2.4.4.3.  Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity
CAB was negative in a complete set of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity assays. CAB has demonstrated 
a lack of carcinogenic potential in conventional oral 2-year studies in mouse and rats.
2.4.4.4.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity
Reproductive toxicity studies included studies to evaluate potential effects on fertility (rat), embryo-
foetal development (rat, rabbit) and pre-postnatal development (rat). All studies employed the oral 
route of administration and, excepted for a dose range finding study in rabbits and two follow-up 
investigative pre- postnatal studies in rats, all were GLP-compliant. 
Potential adverse effects of cabotegravir on fertility were investigated in a dedicated study in male 
rats, and in a combined fertility and embryo-foetal development study in female rats. No cabotegravir-
related effects on male or female fertility were observed at oral doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day, the 
maximum tested dose. Based on toxicokinetic data from the 26-week oral repeated dose toxicity study 
in rats, this dose is estimated to correspond to a systemic exposure level (AUC0-24) at least 20-fold 
higher than that reached in patients treated at the oral recommended dose of 30 mg/day.
Potential adverse effects of cabotegravir on embryo-foetal development were investigated in a 
combined fertility and embryo-foetal development study in female rats and in two dedicated studies in 
rabbits, one dose range finding and the other pivotal. The combined study in rats and the pivotal study 
in rabbits had cabotegravir administered at a dose of up to 1000 and 2000 mg/kg/day, respectively.
In rats, there was no evidence of a treatment-related increased incidence of foetal anomalies at any 
dose level. Based on a decrease in foetal weights at the high dose level, the developmental NOAEL was 
determined at 5 mg/kg/day. Based on toxicokinetic data from the 26-week oral repeated dose toxicity 
Assessment report 
EMA/360205/2023 
Page 32/150
study in rats, at this dose, maternal exposure levels (AUC0-24) are estimated to be approximately 14-
fold those reached in patients treated orally at 30 mg/day. 
In rabbits, the absence of treatment-related effect on embryo-foetal development is claimed at all dose 
levels. Systemic exposure at the maximum tested dose, also the maximum feasible dose, was very 
low, 0.66-fold that in patients treated with 30 mg/day. The maximum tested dose induced some 
maternal toxicity based mostly on a transient decrease in body weight gain.
Studies on pre-postnatal development comprised three studies in rats, one pivotal and two follow-up 
investigative studies - a study on the cause of the increased F1 offspring postnatal deaths, namely, on 
its dependency on exposure in utero and/or during lactation, and a study on toxicokinetics. 
In the initial PPND study, rats were treated from GD6 to LD20 at oral doses of 0.5, 5 or 1000 
mg/kg/day. At the high dose level, treatment-related decreases in F1 pup survival and viability were 
observed (increased number of stillborn pups and neonatal mortality from PND1 to PND4); it resulted 
in reduced litter sizes during the first 4 days of life. Postnatal development of pups surviving on PND4 
was not shown to be affected by treatment. 
The NOAEL for perinatal mortality was set at 5 mg/kg/day. Based on the exposure levels observed in 
the 26-week repeat-dose toxicity study in rats, systemic exposure at 5 mg/kg/day is estimated to be 
12.75-14.27-fold that expected in patients treated orally with 30 mg/day.
The follow-up PPND study on causality confirmed these adverse findings and cross-fostering 
experiments showed that perinatal mortality was attributable to gestational, but not to lactational, 
exposure to cabotegravir and was not related to decreased maternal care. In both studies, the duration 
of gestation at 1000 mg/kg/day was longer than that of controls but remained within the historical 
control range. There was also no treatment-related effect on the average pup delivery time in any 
study (a finding which could account for increased stillbirth or neonatal mortality). The follow-up PPND 
study showed that the proportion of stillbirths on GD23 (i.e., pups born from dams with delayed onset 
of parturition) was 3.5-fold higher in the treated group than in the control group (1.3% vs. 4.6%; or 
2/152 vs. 22/478) and was above the historical control data. It is also noted that stillbirths were not 
reported on GD22 in the control group (0/305 pups) whereas it affected 2/99 pups (2%) exposed in 
utero to cabotegravir born on that day. Moreover, the number of pups born on GD23 and dead on 
PND1 prior to cross-fostering was clearly increased in the treated (17) vs. control (0) group. Therefore, 
an effect of treatment on perinatal mortality cannot be excluded. 
The additional investigative toxicokinetic study indicates that exposure levels of both maternal animals 
and pups were similar at GD20 when dams were treated on GD20 only or from GD6 up the GD20. 
No juvenile animal studies have been conducted. 
2.4.4.5.  Local Tolerance 
CAB could be considered to be non-irritant and non-sensitizer.
2.4.4.6.  Other toxicity studies
CAB could be considered to be non-immunosuppressive. Effect in anti-KLH IgG antibody observed in 
males was considered as minimal and not observed in females. 
Based on the absence of any relevant signals in the repeat dose toxicity studies, no dependence study 
was performed. This is acceptable.

No discussion was provided by the Applicant regarding the potential phototoxicity of cabotegravir. 
Nevertheless, it is known that CAB absorbs mainly at 257nm, and could be considered as non-
phototoxic.
Data generated in standard and/or impurity-spiked repeat-dose toxicology studies are  considered 
sufficient to qualify the proposed specifications for the CAB- impurities and degradation products.  The 
control strategy for the genotoxic or potentially genotoxic impurities are considered generally as 
adequate but only a Summary of the ‘Evaluation of Cabotegravir and Cabotegravir sodium Synthesis 
and Degradation Impurities (Actual and Potential) for Potential Mutagenicity’ was provided in section 
3.2.S.2.6. of each drug substance. The analysis of the Free base and free acid structures was 
performed using Derek Nexus version v6.0 (KB 2018 1.1), Lhasa Ltd.; Leadscope version 2.2.1 
(Salmonella version 3, E. Coli-Sal 102 version 1), Leadscope Inc.
2.4.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment
An Environmental Risk Assessment for Apretude (Cabotegravir sodium) was submitted following with 
the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2, 2006 and the Questions and answers on Guideline on the 
environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use” (EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010 
Rev. 1, 2016) document. 
ERA report structure and requirements fulfilled the relevant EU guidelines. The studies were conducted 
according to appropriate OECD test guidelines and under GLP conditions. The species used for testing 
are species recommended in the OECD test guidelines. Protocols of the ecotoxicological studies were 
sufficiently detailed to confirm compliance and references made to OECD tests were appropriate. 
A comprehensible, concise and detailed ERA report for the active substance, consisted of Phase I and 
Phase II assessments. All the relevant information required was given, and environmental impact was 
assessed based on the scientific discussion of the results obtained.
The main results for Phase I and II assessment and the analysis of the results are reported in the 
following table.

The applicant provided an ERA Phase 1. Log Pow values were experimentally determined at pH 5, 7 
and 9, according to OECD 107 (Test Partition Coefficient (n-octanol/water): Shake Flask Method). The 
log Pow values of 1.64, 1.62 and 0.96 are clearly below 4.5, the action limit for further screening of 
persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity (PBT). Therefore, Cabotegravir is not considered a PBT 
substance.
Assessment report 
EMA/360205/2023 
Page 35/150
The Applicant calculated the PECsurfacewater in compliance with the guideline on ERA 
EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr. 2, 2006. The PECsurfacewater exceeds the action limit of 0.01 mg/L, 
so a Phase II environmental fate and effects analysis is required, according to the Guideline 
EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2, 2006.
Phase II is focused on obtaining data related to chronic ecotoxicological effects, biodegradation, 
potential for sorption to soil or sludge, and potential for partitioning to sediment of Cabotegravir. The 
data from studies on aquatic species and sludge organisms are used to derive predicted no-effect 
concentrations (PNEC) for relevant environmental compartments according to the Guidance 
EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 Corr 2, 2006. The fate data can be used to assess transport within the 
environment and potential depletion mechanisms and may be used to derive predicted environmental 
concentrations. The more relevant methods were used and the results were discussed.
Cabotegravir is not lipophilic at environmentally relevant pH and is unlikely to bioconcentrate in 
exposed aquatic organisms. A moderately high water/sludge distribution coefficient (Koc) suggests it 
will partition to the terrestrial environment to some extent but not to a degree that warrants a 
terrestrial risk assessment. It is not readily nor inherently biodegradable and is not expected to be 
extensively mineralized. Although this substance is considered to be persistent it is expected to be 
relatively immobile in the aquatic and terrestrial environment due to its adsorption/desorption 
characteristics in soil and sediment.
In Phase II Tier A, environmental fate studies were performed in accordance with relevant OECD 
guidelines. The PEC is compared to an acceptable environmental concentration, the Predicted No Effect 
Concentration (PNEC) and no risk was identified in Tier A. PEC/PNEC ratios for surface water and 
groundwater were < 1, and for the PECsurfacewater/PNECmicro-organisms was < 0.1. Therefore, no further 
evaluation was deemed necessary. Based on these results, Cabotegravir is not expected to pose a risk 
to surface water, groundwater or wastewater treatment facilities.
PEC/PNEC for surfacewater, groundwater, micro-organisms were below the action limits, indicate that 
the environmentally relevant residues of Cabotegravir are of low risk for all compartments. Therefore, 
no risk for the environment is to be expected.
As the water/sediment study (OECD 308) demonstrated significant shifting of the drug substance to 
the sediment (more than 10% at 14 days is present in sediment), effects on sediment dwelling 
organism were investigated. The study on sediment toxicity of Cabotegravir was performed on the 
larvae Chironomus riparius according to OECD 218. 
In Phase II Tier B, sediment toxicity of Cabotegravir on the midge larvae Chironomus riparius was 
evaluated according to OECD 218. The PEC/PNEC ratio for sediment was < 1. Therefore, Cabotegravir 
is unlikely to pose a risk to sediment dwelling organisms and no further testing is necessary.
The SmPC and PL contain sufficient information regarding precautionary and safety measures taken to 
reduce the risk to the environment. 
Conclusion
The Applicant provided an environmental risk assessment (ERA) for cabotegravir in accordance with 
the Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr. 2, 2006). Considering the above data, Cabotegravir is not expected 
to pose a risk to the environment. From the results of ERA studies, no significant environmental safety 
issues were identified.
Since no environmental concerns are apparent, it is assumed that Cabotegravir is unlikely to represent 
a risk for the environment following its prescribed usage.

2.4.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects
CAB inhibits HIV integrase by binding to the integrase active site and blocking the strand transfer step 
of retroviral Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) integration which is essential for the HIV replication cycle. 
CAB is a potent in vitro inhibitor of HIV integrase and inhibits the integrase catalysed viral DNA strand 
transfer with IC50 values in the nanomolar range (3.0 to 13 nM). The antiviral activity is provided in 
clinical pharmacology section.
CAB at 10 µM did not significantly affect (defined as ≥50%) 80 of the 81 in vitro assays for possible 
interactions with isolated or tissue enzymes, physiological receptor, ion channel and transporter. The 
only effect greater than 50% was a 53% inhibition of binding to the human recombinant melanocortin 
(MC4) receptor seen at a concentration (20 uM) higher than clinical unbound Cmax following oral lead 
in (0.1 uM). The MC4R is involved notably in the regulation of energy homeostasis and food intake, 
and deficiency in the MC4R is associated with monogenic obesity. The potential to antagonise MC4R 
was also observed for another integrase inhibitor dolutegravir (Tivicay) at a concentration equal to the 
clinical Cmax. Notwithstanding, no findings associated with MC4R agonism or antagonism have been 
observed in toxicity studies with CAB, and there were no clinically significant patterns of changes in 
vital signs (weight, heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure) across the clinical studies. 
Additionally, variations in weight or appetite were generally not reported or reported as uncommon 
adverse drug reactions in any of the clinical studies and were generally similar between CAB and 
comparators. 
In safety pharmacology core battery assays, no respiratory effects nor neurobehavioral effects 
occurred in rats dosed orally with cabotegravir, at multiple s of clinical Cmax for oral lead in 
administration. 
CAB at 7.14 µg/mL (the maximum concentration limited by solubility), equivalent to 17.61 µM approx. 
the human Cmax for oral lead in administration, caused no inhibition of hERG channel tail current in 
HEK-293 cells stably transfected with hERG cDNA. In conscious telemetered male monkeys, a mild, 
transient increase in mean arterial pressure (3.7 to 8.6%) and a transient increase in heart rate (16 to 
23%) during the first 2 hours after oral cabotegravir dosing, was observed. However, in a thorough 
QTc study (mass balance study in healthy subjects) oral dose of CAB supratherapeutic dose of 150 mg 
q 12 h x 3 doses had no significant effect on cardiac repolarization.
PK studies were carried out in animal species and strains used in the toxicological testing of CAB, to 
enable meaningful assessment of the exposure levels in the toxicity studies and provide confidence in 
the conclusions drawn regarding the safety of CAB in humans. The species and strains used were CD-1 
mice, Sprague Dawley rats, partially pigmented Lister-Hooded rats, Dutch belted rabbits, beagle dogs 
and cynomolgus monkeys. 
Following single IV administration of CAB to dogs and monkeys, the CAB concentration time profile was 
indicative of a lower clearance and longer half-life.
In rats and monkeys given a single SC or IM injection, CAB was slowly released from the injection site 
with a mean apparent plasma half-life ranging from 12 to 29 days (SC) or from 8 to 12 days (IM). 
Following oral administration as a solution, the oral bioavailability of CAB in mice, rats and monkeys 
was good (44 to 83%) and consistent with its high passive permeability. However, when administered 
as a suspension, or in solid dosage forms, the bioavailability appeared limited by dissolution rate or 
solubility which resulted in a less than proportional increase in systemic exposure of CAB relative to 
dose. CAB has high passive membrane permeability. The protein binding of CAB in rat, dog, monkey 
and human plasma and serum was high (>99%). After oral administration of [14C]-CAB to rats, 
radioactivity was slowly absorbed and then largely confined to the systemic circulation albeit widely 
distributed to other tissues. Radiolabelled drug-related material was minimally associated with cellular 
Assessment report 
EMA/360205/2023 
Page 37/150
components of blood. Elimination of radioactivity was slow with most tissues containing low but 
quantifiable radioactivity at 28 days. Association of radioactivity to the melanin-containing tissues in 
the eye and skin was not observed. 
In general, the metabolism of CAB in the nonclinical species reflects that observed in humans, with 
CAB being the principal component circulating in plasma. The major metabolite of CAB in all species 
was CAB glucuronide, which was formed primarily by UGT1A1 (with some involvement from UGT1A9) 
and was eliminated in the urine and bile. Additional studies in human (IM, SC and PO) confirmed that 
the metabolism and excretion of CAB is independent of route of administration. Metabolic conversion of 
CAB to its stereoisomers was not detected in rat, dog, monkey or human hepatocytes, or in human 
plasma following repeat oral administration for 14 days.
Across all species, elimination of drug-related material occurred predominantly via the faeces (58.5 to 
94.5% of the dose). No clinical drug interaction risk was identified for co-administered substrates of 
CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 3A4, UGT1A1, 1A3, 1A4, 1A6, 1A9, 2B4, 2B7, 2B15, and 
2B17, Pgp, BCRP, BSEP, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, MATE1, MATE 2-K, MRP2 or 
MRP4 at a clinical oral dose of 30 mg CAB.  As CAB is metabolized by UGT1A1 and a clinical study has 
confirmed a drug interaction with the UGT1A1 inducer rifampin, the co-administration of CAB with 
strong inducers of UGT is contraindicated. This potential drug interaction is stated in the SmPC.
Additionally, an in vitro study that included CAB was conducted to assess integrase inhibitors as 
potential inhibitors of human folate transport pathways. In vitro, CAB did not inhibit proton-coupled 
folate transport or reduce folate carrier activity up to the highest concentration tested (100 M). In the 
folate receptor  assay, CAB demonstrated 36.7% inhibition at 25.8 M; the in vitro concentration is 
approx. 200-fold higher than the clinical unbound Cmax for oral lead in. The applicant presented 
resounding data showing that CAB is not a clinical inhibitor of folate transport pathways, and it was not 
predicted to elicit clinical decreases in maternal and foetal folate levels.  However, according to Foster 
et al., 2022 (https://doi.org/10.3390/ph15121533), more investigation and comprehensive data are 
needed to understand the PK, placental passage, and safety of CAB in pregnancy in order to confirm or 
refute the potential safety signal of neural tube birth defects observed in infants born to women 
receiving dolutegravir-based ART periconception. This is particularly relevant for PrEP indication. 
Currently, the statement in section 4.6 “Apretude injection is not recommended during pregnancy 
unless the expected benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. Cabotegravir has been detected in 
systemic circulation for up to 12 months or longer after an injection, therefore, consideration should be 
given to the potential for foetal exposure during pregnancy (see section 4.4)” seems adequate from a 
(non-)clinical point of view.
Repeated dose toxicity studies included 9 studies with daily oral (mice, rats and cynomolgus monkeys) 
administration up 13, 26 and 39 weeks, and one 13-week study conducted in rats dosed with weekly 
or monthly administration by subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. 
Cabotegravir was generally well tolerated without adverse effects in the oral repeat-dose toxicity 
studies in mice, rats and monkeys. 
The 39-week study in monkeys revealed ocular findings in two monkeys - slight vascular inflammation 
was noted unilaterally near the optic nerve of a single monkey dosed with 500 mg/kg/day and 
inflammation and swelling of the optic nerve head with peripapillary oedema and diffuse corneal 
opacity was observed in a single animal dosed with 50 mg/kg/day. Both ocular findings were 
considered incidental. 
At the end of the longest-term toxicity studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys (26-week and 39-
week, AUC were, approximately, 22 to 32-fold, in rats, and 4-fold, in monkeys, the clinical AUC 
exposure in patients treated with oral doses of 30 mg/day.
Assessment report 
EMA/360205/2023 
Page 38/150
In the rat study with subcutaneous or intramuscular administration - with weekly subcutaneous doses, 
monthly subcutaneous doses and monthly intramuscular doses - four high dose animals treated 
monthly were euthanized due to deteriorating conditions or found dead. The cause of moribundity or 
death in these animals was not linked to any underlying pathology findings, as none of these animals 
had explanatory pathology findings distinct from survivors. Therefore, these deaths were considered 
unlikely treatment related.
CAB was negative in a complete set of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity assays. CAB has demonstrated 
a lack of carcinogenic potential in conventional oral 2-year studies in mouse and rats.
Reproductive toxicity studies included studies to evaluate potential effects on fertility (rat), embryo-
foetal development (rat, rabbit) and pre-postnatal development (rat). All studies employed the oral 
route of administration.
No cabotegravir-related effects on male or female fertility were observed at oral doses at least 20-fold 
higher than that reached in humans treated at the oral recommended dose of 30 mg/day.
In rats, there was no evidence of a treatment-related increased incidence of foetal anomalies at 
exposure approx. 14-fold those reached in humans treated orally at 30 mg/day. 
In rabbits, no treatment-related increase in post-implantation loss nor treatment-related increase in 
foetal malformations was observed at 0.66-fold the exposure in humans treated with 30 mg/day. The 
maximum tested dose induced some maternal toxicity based mostly on a transient decrease in body 
weight gain.
Studies on pre-postnatal development comprised three studies in rats, one pivotal and two follow-up 
investigative studies - a study on the cause of the increased F1 offspring postnatal deaths, namely, on 
its dependency on exposure in utero and/or during lactation, and a study on toxicokinetics. 
In the initial PPND study, treatment-related decreases in F1 pup survival and viability were observed 
(increased number of stillborn pups and neonatal mortality from PND1 to PND4) at the high dose 
(1000 mg/kg/day). At the NOAEL, systemic exposure was estimated to be 12.75-14.27-fold the 
exposure expected in humans treated orally with 30 mg/day.
The follow-up PPND study on causality confirmed these adverse findings and cross-fostering 
experiments showed that perinatal mortality was attributable to gestational, but not to lactational, 
exposure to cabotegravir and was not related to decreased maternal care. The follow-up PPND study 
showed that the proportion of stillbirths on GD23 (i.e., pups born from dams with delayed onset of 
maturation) was 3.5-fold higher in the treated group than in the control group (1.3% vs. 4.6%; or 
2/152 vs. 22/478), and was above the historical control data. It is also noted that stillbirths were not 
reported on GD22 in the control group (0/305 pups) whereas it affected 2/99 pups (2%) exposed in 
utero to cabotegravir born on that day. Moreover, the number of pups born on GD23 and dead on 
PND1 prior to cross-fostering was clearly increased in the treated (17) vs. control (0) group. Therefore, 
an effect of treatment on perinatal mortality cannot be excluded. 
No juvenile animal studies have been conducted. This is acceptable, even if the intended target 
patients’ population for Apretude is not limited to adults. No non-clinical studies are included in the 
agreed Paediatric Investigations Plan.
CAB could be considered to be non-immunosuppressive. Effect in anti-KLH IgG antibody observed in 
males was considered as minimal and not observed in females.
Based on the absence of any relevant signals in the repeat dose toxicity studies, no dependence study 
was performed. This is acceptable.

No discussion was provided by the Applicant regarding the potential phototoxicity of cabotegravir. 
Nevertheless, it is known that CAB absorbs mainly at 257nm, and could be considered as non-
phototoxic.
Data generated in standard and/or impurity-spiked repeat-dose toxicology studies are considered 
sufficient to qualify the proposed specifications for the CAB- impurities and degradation products. The 
control strategy for the genotoxic or potentially genotoxic impurities are considered as adequate. 
Notwithstanding, only a Summary of the ‘Evaluation of Cabotegravir and Cabotegravir sodium 
Synthesis and Degradation Impurities (Actual and Potential) for Potential Mutagenicity’ was provided in 
section 3.2.S.2.6. of each drug substance. 
Considering the above data, cabotegravir is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. From the 
results of ERA studies, no significant environmental safety issues were identified.
2.4.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects
The overall nonclinical program including the data from CAB studies is considered adequate to support 
the efficacy and safety CAB in the PrEP proposed indication.

2.5.2.  Clinical pharmacology
2.5.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics
Cabotegravir (CAB, GSK1265744) is an HIV-1 INSTI. CAB, as 1 component of a dual antiretroviral 
maintenance therapy regimen in combination with the long-acting formulation of rilpivirine, has been 
approved in several countries/regions for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults (in EU it is 
approved with the name Vocabria). The current application concerns the use of CAB for risk reduction 
of sexually acquired HIV-1 infection. To this aim, CAB is to be administered as CAB LA injection 600 
mg 1 month apart, followed by 1 injection 600 mg every 2 months with an optional OLI of CAB 30 mg 
once daily given orally for 1 month. CAB tablets may be used as Oral lead-in (OLI) to assess 
tolerability of CAB prior to administration of CAB LA and as oral PrEP in individuals who will miss 
planned dosing with CAB LA injection.
Study HPTN 083 was a Phase IIb/III, multi-site, double-blind, 2-arm, randomized (1:1), controlled 
non-inferiority study in HIV-uninfected cisgender MSM and TGW where plasma samples were collected 
sparsely at several moments during the clinical study. This data is used for describing the PK of the 
target population.
Study HPTN 084 was a Phase 3 double blind safety and efficacy study of long-acting injectable 
cabotegravir compared to daily oral TDF/FTC for pre-exposure prophylaxis in HIV-uninfected women. 
This data is used for describing the PK of the target population. Again, plasma samples were collected 
sparsely at several moments during the clinical study. This data is also used for describing the PK of 
the target population.
Study 201767 was a Phase I, multicompartmental pharmacokinetic study of cabotegravir long acting in 
healthy adult volunteers. Samples were collected to determine the PK concentrations of CAB LA 
administration in blood plasma and in Vaginal tissue, Cervical tissue, and Cervicovaginal fluid in 
healthy women and in Rectal tissue and Rectal fluid in healthy men and women following a single 600 
mg IM dose. Study design, population handling and bioanalysis are acceptable. Plasma CAB PK was 
consistent with prior studies and CAB concentrations in tissue and fluid were proportional to plasma 
over time.
Study 208580 was a Phase I/II study of the safety, acceptability, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of 
oral and long-acting injectable cabotegravir and long-acting injectable rilpivirine in virologically 
suppressed HIV-infected children and adolescents. Plasma samples were collected in a mix of rich and 
sparse collections at different time periods to both describe the PK in the population and test the 
attainment of an exposure similar to the adult population.
Study 206898 was an open label, Phase I study to evaluate the PK, safety, tolerability and 
acceptability of long-acting injections of the HIV integrase inhibitor, cabotegravir in HIV uninfected 
Chinese men. Plasma samples were collected in a mix of rich and sparse collections at different time 
periods to evaluate the plasma PK of CAB following repeat oral administration (Day 1 to Week 4) and 
CAB LA IM injections throughout the Injection Phase (Weeks 5 to 41).
Analytical methods
Method validations are provided and can be considered acceptable. The bioanalytical methods used to 
measure concentrations of CAB in several human tissues were selective, accurate, and reproducible. All 
methods were appropriately validated, both prior and during studies.

Pharmacokinetic data analysis
The PK of CAB following PO and IM administration was adequately characterized by PopPK analysis 
based on data from healthy subjects and HIV-1-infected subjects. A 2-compartment model with first-
order oral and IM absorption and elimination best described the plasma CAB PK profile, both after 
single and repeated dosing.
All parameters could be estimated with adequate precision, as measured by a RSE <20% for fixed 
effects (except for needle length on KA2, with an RSE of 36.2%) and a RSE <25% for random effects. 
The prediction-corrected VPC demonstrated that the final model adequately described the time course 
of plasma CAB concentration and its associated variability after oral and IM dosing and can be 
considered as fit-for purpose. The causes of the high (> 30%) shrinkage values on KA1, V2/F and F1 
should be due to the flip-flop and long absorption half-life that limits the correct characterization of the 
absorption process.
The model characterized the ‘flip-flop’ (absorption-rate limited) nature of CAB PK following IM injection. 
The PopPK estimate of plasma CAB half-life after oral dosing was 36.5 hours and after IM dosing was 
6.4 weeks for the overall population (5.6 weeks for males and 11.5 weeks for females). The 
bioavailability of oral CAB relative to long-acting injection CAB (F1) was estimated to be 76%.
External validation of the Population Pharmacokinetic Model was made with High-Risk Participants of 
study 083 and 084 and the pcVPC (stratified by sex at birth, gender identity subgroup and race) 
suggest that the final PopPK model was able to reliably describe and predict CAB PK from Studies HPTN 
083 and HPTN 084.
Regarding the Adolescent participants in study 208580, the data collected in this study was also used 
as an external validation of the Population Pharmacokinetic Model as well as for an additional age 
covariate analysis (study 2021N462341). From the pcVPC, showing that CAB PopPK model (updated by 
fixing the exponent to 0.75 for body weight on clearances and fixing the exponent to 1 for body weight 
on volumes) adequately captured the observed concentration-versus-time points and trends within the 
90% PI (5th and 95th percentiles) of the simulated values, it can be concluded that the CAB PopPK 
model can adequately describe and predict CAB PK behaviour of the adolescents in Study 208580. This 
was further supported by the fact that the additional age covariate analysis resulted in a final model 
identical to the previously developed one (without the adolescent data). Also, the re-estimated 
parameters with the adolescent data were essentially the same as in the original model.
Absorption
After IM administration, a tmax of 7 days and a flip-flop kinetic process was observed. After oral 
administration, a fast absorption with a tmax of 3h was observed.
No absolute BA was determined due to the impossibility to administered CAB by IV route. The absolute 
bioavailability of oral CAB is, however, predicted to be high based on the high passive permeability of 
CAB, a high relative bioavailability of oral vs IM, and minimal impact of food on plasma CAB absorption 
rate. Since in Study LAI117008 approximately 26.8% of the radioactivity was eliminated in urine after 
a single oral dose of marked Cabotegravir, it can be inferred that absolute bioavailability is at least 
26.8%.
Along with information on solubility, the suggested BCS classification for Cabotegravir in BCS class II is 
acceptable from a PK standpoint.
Bioequivalence
No bioequivalence studies have been part of this clinical pharmacology program, some relative 
bioavailability studies have been performed.

Study LAI116815 led to selection of the 200 nm nanomilled formulation for LA IM injections.
In study ITZ111682, the oral tablet resulted in a lower exposure than the solution, by 0.6 to 0.7 fold, 
and Tmax was shorter for the solution. 
In Study LAI116585, both free acid candidate oral formulations provided relative bioavailability of at 
least 50% to that of the current sodium salt. The AUC of the nanomilled and micronized formulations 
were approximately 12% and 48% lower than those of the sodium salt tablet formulation, respectively. 
These data suggested that switching to a free acid oral formulation is viable.
In Study LAI117020, neither new formulation met the criteria for progression into Phase 3.
In study 201741, both test formulations made with micronized drug substance met the preestablished 
acceptance criteria. Neither of the test formulations made with unmicronized drug substance met the 
acceptance criteria. Since a smaller tablet is desirable for ease of administration, the tablet formulation 
with the core tablet weight of 500 mg, utilizing micronized GSK1265744B drug substance was selected 
for progression into phase 3 studies.
Overall, decisions on change and choice of formulations were well detailed and justified.
Influence of food
In study LAI117020, food did not affect 744 PK following administration of the test micronized tablet.
In study ITZ111682, the presence of food increased GSK1265744 AUC(0-inf) and C24 by 15% and had 
no effect on Cmax for the tablet formulation when compared to tablets administered in the fasted 
state.
In study 205696, bioavailability was increased by 4-17% by a high fat meal.
It is agreed that the effect of food on CAB is small and clinically irrelevant, therefore oral CAB can be 
taken without regard to meals. No special recommendations on the oral administration regarding food 
are provided in the SmPC, which is acceptable.
Distribution
Protein binding was high with an unbound fraction of 0.1-0.2% in healthy subjects, in HIV-1-infected 
subjects and in subjects with severe renal impairment. In subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, 
the unbound fraction, which causes the pharmacological effect, was 1.5- to 3-fold higher (0.3%) than 
in subjects with normal liver function. In vitro, the unbound fraction around clinical Cmax was higher 
(0.6%). CAB did not preferentially distribute into red blood cells.
CAB is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP but it also shows high passive permeability. 
Following administration of oral tablets, the mean apparent oral volume of distribution (Vz/F) in plasma 
in healthy subjects was about 12-13 L. Using population PK modelling, the estimated Vc/F was 5.3 L 
and estimated Vp/F was 2.4 L. These volume estimates, along with the assumption of high 
bioavailability, indicate some distribution beyond the plasma volume to the extracellular fluids.
CAB concentrations in plasma and mucosal tissues at sites of sexual transmission were evaluated in 
study 201767 following a single IM dose of CAB LA 600 mg through Week 12. CAB was detected in all 
tissues and fluids potentially relevant to sexual transmission. Tissue and plasma CAB concentrations 
were strongly correlated (r >0.9) and proportional (tissue concentrations~10% to 20% of plasma 
concentrations over time), whereas correlations were weak between time-matched fluid and plasma 
concentrations likely due to the relatively high variability in fluid concentrations.

Elimination
Excretion has been well evaluated and described with the 14C study. Following administration of a 
single dose [14C]-CAB 30 mg to healthy subjects, 59% of the dose was recovered in faeces and 27% 
in urine. CAB accounted for 47% of the dose in faeces and was not detected in urine. The major 
metabolite of CAB, CAB glucuronide, represented most of the radioactivity recovered in urine. CAB 
glucuronide was found to be a substrate of active renal transporters OAT3, MRP2 and MRP4 indicating 
active renal clearance; it is unknown however to what extent CAB glucuronide was also excreted in 
bile.
In vitro metabolism was investigated using pooled human liver, kidney and intestinal microsomal 
fractions and recombinant UGT enzymes. UGT reaction phenotyping in human liver microsomes 
indicates that UGT1A performs approximately 2/3 of metabolism and UGT1A9 approximately 1/3. 
UGT1A3, 1A4, 1A6, 2B4, 2B7 and 2B15 were not involved.
In vivo, the main pathway of metabolism is glucuronidation in metabolite M1. However, in human 
plasma, CAB was the major circulating component, representing 81-100% of radioactivity in plasma 
following an oral dose and >99% of IM administered drug-related material. CAB-glucuronide (M1) was 
a minor component in plasma (<5%). 
In urine, M1 was the major component, representing 75 - >85% of drug related material following oral 
administration and >90% following IM administration. CAB in urine comprised <10%. Minor 
metabolites found in urine were M2 (product of glucose conjugation), M3 (formed by oxidation, fluorine 
loss, and cysteine conjugation) and M4 (formed by pentose conjugation), which were found at <5%, 
<1% and <1% of drug related material respectively. The data indicate active elimination of CAB 
glucuronide.
In faeces, CAB was the only quantified component, representing 83% of radioactivity and 47% of the 
radio-labelled oral dose. As mentioned above, this is expected to contain deconjugated metabolite as 
well as unabsorbed CAB.
CAB and M1 were both detected in bile of humans.
No significant conversion was observed of CAB to any of its stereoisomers was observed.
Based on the in vitro transporter data, CAB glucuronide is a substrate of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT3, 
MRP2, MRP3 and MRP4, but not of P-gp, BCRP, OAT1 and OAT4. As none of the metabolites are 
pharmacologically active and no metabolites were quantified in pooled plasma samples, PK of 
metabolites was not further studied.
UGTA1 activity polymorphism will impact Cabotegravir PK, but in proportions not expected to have 
clinical impact (mean values of Ctau, AUCtau, and Cmax ~1.5, 1.4 and 1.3-fold higher in subject with 
low relative to normal predicted activity). This conclusion is acceptable.
Dose proportionality and time dependency
Overall, the data indicate consistently that AUC and Cmax are dose proportional to slightly less than 
dose proportional over the clinical dose ranges following oral and IM administration.
The time to achieve steady state is governed by half-life and is prolonged with an LA regimen; 
however, efficacious concentrations are achieved following the initial IM injection. For the Q8W 
regimen, the loading dose achieves concentrations consistent with steady state 4 weeks following the 
initiation injection. 
Assessment report 
EMA/360205/2023 
Page 46/150
Steady-state plasma CAB concentrations are achieved by Day 7 following once daily administration of 
oral CAB in HIV-1-infected participants, consistent with the approximate 2.5-fold accumulation and a 
t1/2 of approximately 41 hours.
Overall, PK of cabotegravir appears to be time independent.
Intra- and inter-individual variability
Moderate between-subject variability in plasma CAB PK was observed following repeat-dose 
administration of CAB both orally and IM. Higher between-subject variability in plasma CAB PK was 
observed with single dose administration of CAB LA. 
Within-subject variability in plasma CAB PK was low following administration of oral CAB. No WSCV is 
available for the IM administration.
In general, the between-subject variability in CAB PK upon repeated monthly IM injection seems to be 
somewhat lower than upon once daily oral dosing and variability in HIV-1 subjects was only slightly 
higher than in healthy subjects.
Pharmacokinetics in target population
PK in target population was evaluated in HIV-Uninfected Women (Study HPTN 084 - 201739) and HIV-
Uninfected cisgender MSM and TGW (Study HPTN 083 – 201738).
Observation of different studies, as well as population PK analysis (2021N484575), showed that HIV 
infected patients presented PK profiles similar to healthy subjects. Plasma CAB exposure following 
administration of CAB LA Q8W regimen is similar between healthy, HIV-1-infected, and high-risk 
participants based on results of cross-study comparisons. Overall, high-risk participants appear to have 
a PK behaviour similar to the previous studied populations of healthy and HIV infected patients.
Special populations
Impaired renal function
The clinical study and the population PK analysis (study 2018N384611) led to the same conclusion that 
CAB can be administered without dose adjustment in subjects with mild to severe renal impairment 
(not on renal replacement therapy). Severe RI had minimal impact on plasma CAB Cmax and AUC(0-
inf). The total exposures to CAB were similar in subjects with severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 
mL/min) compared with healthy, matched control subjects.
CAB has not been studied in subjects with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on renal replacement 
therapy. CAB is not expected to be cleared by renal replacement therapies, such as haemodialysis or 
peritoneal dialysis, due to CAB’s high protein binding and because absorption is slow from the CAB LA 
IM depot site, such that minimal drug would be available to dialysis.
Impaired hepatic function
Both population PK analysis (study 2018N384611) and a dedicated clinical study show that CAB may 
be taken without dose adjustment in subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Moderate 
hepatic impairment had minimal impact on plasma CAB Cmax and AUC(0-inf). The total plasma 
concentration exposure was only slightly reduced and the unbound plasma concentration slightly 
increased. Given that plasma CAB Cmax is lower following LA administration, subjects with mild or 
moderate hepatic impairment would be expected to have lower unbound Cmax than observed following 
oral dosing.

Gender
No specific studies have been performed investigating gender effect. From the popPK analysis (study 
2018N384611) it may be concluded that females had 50.9% lower ka2 compared with males. As a 
result, due to the absorption rate-limited PK, CAB LA has a longer apparent t½ for females of 11.5 
weeks as compared to the apparent t1/2 of 5.6 weeks for males. The slower IM absorption in certain 
females may be due to differences in body composition. From the PopPK simulations, median CAB 
Cmin after the first injection was lower in females than males by 31%. Median Cmin at steady state 
was higher in females than males by 9%.
Observed CAB LA plasma concentrations in high-risk participants from Study HPTN 083 (male gender 
at birth) and Study HPTN 084 (female gender at birth) are similar to male participants and female 
participants in healthy and HIV-infected participants. 
In conclusion, there was an effect of gender but small enough to not justify any dose modification.
Race
No specific studies have been performed investigating race effect. From the popPK analysis it may be 
concluded that race does not seem to influence CAB PK. Also, Observed CAB LA plasma concentrations 
in high-risk participants from Study HPTN 083 and Study HPTN 084 (Race: White, Black or African 
American, Asian, Other) are similar to healthy, low-risk participants (HPTN 077), and HIV-infected 
participants (Study 207966).
Study 206898 was conducted to determine CAB PK profile in Chinese healthy subjects when 
administered orally (30 mg/day for 28 days) or followed by i.m. (600mg once every 4 weeks for a total 
of 2 dosing and 1 every 8 weeks) as monotherapy. The study was not powered to detect any effect of 
race on CAB PK, however through an indirect comparison with study 201103 (whose Cohort 2 is 
comparable in posology scheme, subjects’ age and low risk for acquiring HIV infection), which included 
non-Asian healthy subjects, such influence could be likely excluded because of the similarity of PK 
profile. 
Also, popPK study 2021N467204 was to provide additional evidence on the effect of race (North East 
Asian vs not- NEA participants) on CAB PK profile in terms of KA, Cl, F. Results confirm that PK 
parameters that are specific to the CAB LA formulation [i.e., absorption rate constant for LA CAB (Ka2) 
and relative bioavailability oral-LA i.m. (F1)] were similar between NEA and Not-NEA. Due to lower 
body weight and clearance for NEA, a higher CAB exposure following repeated i.m. administration is 
expected in such population with respect to not-NEA subjects. A post-hoc PK analysis suggested that 
such higher CAB plasma concentration does not exceed the safety threshold of 22 µg/mL, thus no dose 
adjustment is foreseen in Asian population.
Weight
No specific studies have been performed investigating weight effect. The popPK analysis 2021N484575 
analysed CAB PK in participants who were <50 kg at enrolment versus participants ≥50 kg. Plasma 
CAB concentrations appeared to trend higher in participants <50 kg.

Adult and Adolescent Population 
Elderly
No specific studies have been performed investigating age effect. From the popPK analysis (study 
2018N384611) it may be concluded that age had no effect on CAB PK within the age range studied. 
However, only a limited number of subjects had >65 years (n=35). No clinically relevant difference in 
PK was observed in high-risk participants from Study HPTN 083 and Study HPTN 084 aged 18 to 24 
years and ≥25 years.
Children
PK data from 8 adolescents with HIV infection was evaluated by means of the already developed popPK 
for the adult population. From this, it could be concluded that the combined population PK analysis 
with both adolescent and adult PK data confirmed no impact of age on the PK of cabotegravir. Also, the 
developed model could be used to predict the exposure in adolescents ≥35kg body weight. Finally, HIV 
status had no impact on cabotegravir PK. As CAB PK was similar in healthy and HIV-infected adults 
administered Q8W CAB regimen, no differences are expected in CAB PK between adolescents evaluated 
in Study 208580 and adolescents who will receive CAB PrEP.
It should be noted that study 208580 design foreseen the enrolment of a different study population 
compared to the target population of the sought indication, i.e. study 208580 enrolled HIV infected 
patients instead healthy subjects which would be the target of the indication of prevention of HIV 
infection. Also, the dosage foreseen in the study is different, i.e. CAB (Cohort 1C) – CAB 30 mg once 
daily orally for at least 4 weeks (up to a maximum of 6 weeks) in addition to cART (Step 1), followed 
by 3 IM injections of CAB LA, each separated by 4 weeks (600 mg for the first injection and 400 mg for 
the second and third injections), in addition to cART (Step 2). The Applicant was considered compliant 
with PIP approved final decision (EMEA-C-001418-PIP02-15-M03): “The analysis of the combined 
PopPK model with the inclusion of both adolescent and adult PK data confirmed no impact of age on 
CAB PK parameters indicating a good precision of the final model (final111) PopPK model built without

the adolescent data. Therefore, this final model has been used for the prediction of the exposures in 
adolescents receiving the adult Q8W dosing regimen.
The PopPK analyses demonstrated that the same adult Q8W regimen in adolescents will result in 
systemic exposures comparable to those in adults and within safety and treatment-based efficacy 
thresholds. Therefore, the remaining 7 adolescents from the cohort 1 can be waived as the pop PK 
model seems to have a good precision to predict the Q8W dosing regimen without requiring PK data in 
adolescents at this regimen.”
However, a certain degree in exposure variability has been observed, partially due to the low number 
of adolescents observed subjects. It is also noted that, during the CAB oral phase, about the 5% of the 
subjects weighting 35 < 50 kg could reach plasma concentration slightly above 22.5 µg/mL, which is 
highest exposure observed in clinical studies not associated with any toxicity. Also, in the simulations 
made in the popPK study 2021N462341, it is showed that both at the oral administration phase and 
that after the CAB LA Initiation Injection, there is the risk of having Cmax values above the safety 
value of 22.5 µg/mL which represents the geometric median of Cmax observed at the supratherapeutic 
dose of oral CAB in TQT study and was not associated with any toxicity. (see figures below).

DDI
In Vitro
In study RH2007/00181, no results were provided for the positive controls and all substrates used 
were different from examples mentioned in the Guideline on the Investigation of Drug Interactions 
(CPMP/EWP/560/95/Rev. 1 Corr. 2). This was however a preliminary study. In this study, low inhibition 
potential was shown for CAB on CYP1A2, 2C9 and 2C19 (IC50 12.5- >33 µM, 15 and 13 µM 
respectively) in pooled human liver microsomes. No inhibition potential (IC50 >33 µM) was shown on 
CYP2D6 and 3A4.
In study 2012N151766, no inhibition potential (IC50 >100 µM) was shown for CAB on CYP1A2, 2A6, 
2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 in human liver microsomes. Some inhibition was shown on CYP3A4/5. 
Direct inhibition was observed only at high concentrations (IC50 84 µM). Metabolism-dependent 
inhibition was observed with IC50 of 41 µM. 
Assessment report 
EMA/360205/2023 
Page 51/150
Based on the observed in vitro IC50 values, it is unlikely that cabotegravir is an inhibitor of CYP at 
clinically relevant systemic concentrations following PO and IM administration. In addition, it is unlikely 
that cabotegravir is an inhibitor of CYP at clinically relevant portal vein and intestinal concentrations 
following PO administration.
The clinical consequence of such a feature has been clarified through results observed in the clinical 
DDI study LAI116815 assessing the effect of CAB on midazolam (a probe CYP3A4 substrate) 
pharmacokinetics.
CAB inhibited UGT1A3 and UGT1A9, with IC50 values of 12 µM and 46 µM, respectively. CAB may alter 
the exposure of UGT1A3 substrate (e.g., naproxen) at therapeutic concentrations while IC50 for 
UGT1A9 is higher than the worst concentrations expected at the hepatic level. Therefore, the risk of 
clinically relevant DDI related to inhibition of UGT1A9 is unlikely whereas UGT1A3 inhibition by CAB 
cannot be ruled out. The ability for CAB to be involved in DDI through UGT1A3 inhibition has been also 
assessed using a mechanistic approach (see thereafter). The predicted AUC ratio is <1.25, hence no 
meaningful DDI expected.
At the highest concentration tested, 100 µM, CAB inhibited UGT1A1 by 15% (in human liver 
microsomes) to 33% (with recombinant UGT1A1) and UGT2B17 by 24%. This is not expected to be 
clinically relevant.
Based on the in vitro induction data, it is unlikely that cabotegravir is an inducer via AhR, CAR and PXR 
at maximal intestinal, portal vein and systemic concentrations after oral administration and at maximal 
systemic concentrations after IM administration.
CAB did not inhibit P-gp, BCRP, MRP2, MRP4, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, OCT2, BSEP, MATE1, and 
MATE2-K at clinically relevant concentrations (maximal intestinal concentrations for P-gp and BCRP, 
maximal portal vein concentrations for OCT1, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 and maximal systemic 
concentrations for all transporters). 
CAB inhibited OAT1 and OAT3 with IC50 values of 0.812 µM and 0.411 µM, which indicates that 
inhibition of these transporters in vivo cannot be excluded (IC50 value is lower than the maximal 
systemic concentration following PO and IM administration). PBPK modelling predicted that exposure to 
several OAT1/OAT3 substrates would not increase more than 25% when used in combination with CAB. 
However, CAB will be used chronically and remains in the body for a long time. Considering this and 
the fact that IC50 values for OAT1 and OAT3 inhibition were approximately 10-fold below the 
estimated maximal concentration of 50-fold unbound Cmax as mentioned in the Guideline on the 
investigation of drug interactions, the results from the PBPK modelling can be considered supportive, 
but not sufficient to replace a clinical study regarding the inhibition of OAT1/OAT3 by CAB. As such, a 
SmPC wording of caution for OAT1/3 substrates is presented in part 4.5.
CAB glucuronide did not inhibit P-gp, BCRP, BSEP, MRP2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT2 and MATE2-K up 
to 300 M. CAB glucuronide inhibited human MRP4 and MATE1 by 39.7% and 55.7% at 300 µM, which 
is not expected to be clinically relevant. CAB glucuronide inhibited OAT1 and OAT3 with IC50 of 73.4 
M and 36.5 M, respectively. This may be at least partly due to the presence of CAB in the tested 
batch.
CAB did not inhibit PCFT and RFC up to 100 µM. CAB inhibited the folate receptor  by 37% at 26 µM. 
However, this is not considered clinically relevant.

for CAB due to the UGT1A1 inhibitor rifampicin was comparable to the decrease observed in clinical 
study LAI117010 (48% predicted vs 59% observed). 
The simulations predicted a mean increase of ≤ 25% in systemic exposure for the tested OAT1/OAT3 
substrates with oral cabotegravir. 
The simulations predicted a mean increase of ≤ 11% in systemic exposure of CAB in combination with 
the UGT1A1 inhibitor atazanavir and the UGT1A9 inhibitor mefenamic acid. However, considering the 
limits from the PBPK modelling and simulations, a word of caution was included in the SmPC, part 4.5.
CAB post-hoc PK exposure (AUC, Cmax, Ctau and Tmax) following CAB Q8W regimen in all participants 
in the combined dataset were compared across subgroups in PopPK 2021N484575. CAB post-hoc 
estimates of exposure (geometric mean with 95% CI or median with 5th and 95th percentiles) were 
similar across contraceptive methods in females in Studies 201103 and 201739.
In vivo
No significant interaction was observed between CAB and rilpivirine.
Decrease of CAB exposure can be expected when orally administered CAB is co-administered with 
polyvalent cation-containing products. The Applicant expects that the exposure will not decrease below 
the 10 mg oral CAB exposure. A warning is included in the SmPC to administer antacids at least 2 h 
before and 4 h after oral CAB. The recommendation to administer antacids containing polyvalent 
cations at least 2 hours before, or 4 hours after, oral CAB doses is aligned with instructions for co-
administration in Phase 3 studies.
Rifampin/rifampicin, which is a strong inducer via PXR (including UGT1A1), reduced CAB AUC(0-inf) by 
approximately 2.5-fold (59%) and C24 by 2-fold (50%). Rifampin had no effect of the Cmax. The 
reduction is clinically relevant. Dosing recommendations for co-administration with rifampicin have not 
been established. Co-administration of CAB with rifampicin and other strong UGT1A1 inducers is 
contra-indicated, which is agreed.
Rifabutin reduced CAB AUC(0-tau), Cmax, and Ctau by 21%, 17%, and 8%, respectively.
Etravirine had no effect on AUC(0-tau) and Cmax of CAB. Cmin was slightly decreased (by 14%), 
which is however not considered clinically relevant.
The Applicant concludes that it is not necessary to perform DDI studies with UGT inhibitors based on 
the pharmacogenetics analysis, in which in subjects with low UGT1A1 activity exposure to CAB was 
shown to increase by approximately 1.5-fold.
CAB did not significantly affect the PK of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel. CAB can be co-
administered with oral contraceptives without clinical consequences.
CAB increased AUC(0-t) and Cmax of midazolam by 10% and 9% respectively. This is not clinically 
relevant, indicating that CAB does not significantly inhibit or induce CYP3A enzymes.
Exposure relevant for safety evaluation
The recommended initial CAB injection dose in adults is a single 3 mL (600 mg) IM injection. If OLI has 
been used, the first injection should be planned for the last day of OLI or within 3 days thereafter. One 
month later, a second 3 mL (600 mg) IM injection should be administered. Individuals may be given 
the second 3 mL (600 mg) initiation injection up to 7 days before or after the scheduled dosing date. 
Plasma CAB PK parameters for the proposed regimens are summarized in the table below.

2.5.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics
A significant part of the clinical pharmacology program is based on the cabotegravir development for 
the treatment of HIV-1 infection. The Committee’s assessment has been focused on the studies most 
relevant for the indication intended for Apretude.
Mechanism of action
CAB inhibits HIV integrase by binding to the integrase active site and blocking the strand transfer step 
of retroviral DNA integration which is essential for the HIV replication cycle. Of note, the chemical 
structure of CAB is very close to dolutegravir.
CAB is a potent in vitro inhibitor of HIV integrase and inhibits the integrase catalysed viral DNA strand 
transfer with IC50 values in the nanomolar range (3.0 to 13 nM).
Primary and Secondary pharmacology
The susceptibility of 13 clinically diverse HIV-1 subtype B isolates to integrase inhibition by CAB was 
tested. The mean IC50 for viral replication of the clinical isolate based viruses was 1.3 nM (range 1.0 
to 1.6 nM).

EMA/360205/2023

Table 5: Activity of CAB against a panel of HIV-1 subtypes B clinical isolates
CAB was highly active with broad activity against all HIV-1 (geometric mean EC50 of 0.26 nM and 
range of 0.02 to 1.06 nM) and HIV-2 (geometric mean EC50 of 0.12 nM and range of 0.10 to 0.14 nM) 
isolates tested). In the monocyte-derived macrophage assays using 4 Subtype B isolates, the 
geometric mean EC50 was 0.92 nM and values ranged from 0.29 to 1.64 nM.

isolates in macrophages. 
CAB was evaluated for antiviral activity against a panel of 11 non-HIV viruses. In general, CAB did not 
exhibit significant antiviral activity in this panel. Some activity was observed against rhinovirus (EC50 
= 12.6 µM).

Resistance
Analysis of resistance to CAB was assessed by co-culturing MT-2 cells with Molt-4 cells persistently 
infected with HIV-1 strain IIIB.
The following IN mutations emerged after passaging wild type HIV-1 (with T124A polymorphism) in the 
presence of CAB: Q146L (FC range 1.3-4.6), S153Y alone and in combination (FC range 2.8-8.4), 
S153F (FC range 6.3-6.4), and I162M (FC=2.8).

Isolation from Wild Type NL-432 and Site Directed Mutant INI Resistant HIV-1 Strain NL432 was 
performed. Starting with mutants at IN position 148 (H, K, or R), the following additional mutations 
emerged after passaging with CAB: G56S, V72I, L74M, V75A, T122N, E138K, G140S, G149A, and 
M154I. CAB FC for various combinations of these mutations with Q148H/K/R ranged from 2.2 to 410, 
relative to that observed for NL432.

Table 8: Passage of NL-432 and single mutans with CAB
Comparative susceptibilities to CAB, DTG and RAL were obtained from 42 RAL resistant site directed 
HIV-1 mutants.
CAB showed anti-HIV activity (susceptibility) with fold change (FC) <5 against 22 of 25 INI-resistant 
mutant viruses with single mutations; for DTG there were 24/25 mutant viruses with FC <5. While 
both CAB and DTG had >5-FC with G118R, only CAB had >5 FC with Q148K and Q148R. F121Y and 
T124A caused no increase in FC for either CAB or DTG. N155H resulted in 1.7 FC to CAB and 0.99 FC 
to DTG.
Among the multiple mutants, the highest FC for CAB was observed with mutants containing Q148K (FC 
E138A, Q148K = 81) or Q148R (FC G140C, Q148R = 22).

The occurrence of incident HIV infections in the pivotal trials was analysed and characterized.
In the Pivotal Study 201738 / HPTN 083, 51 HIV incident infections had been identified: 12/3211 PY 
(incidence rate 0.37/100 PY) in the CAB group and 39/3193 PY (incidence rate 1.22/100 PY) in the 
TDF/FTC group. Four (4) incident infections occurred while the participant was receiving active CAB LA 
injections. Based on this, the bias-adjusted HR (95% CI) is 0.31 (0.16, 0.58).
3 participants in the CAB group acquired integrase mutations: 2 participants, who became infected 
during the OLI Phase, and another participant. 3 additional CAB participants with HIV infection had 
NNRTI resistance and 1 had NRTI resistance.
In the Pivotal Study 201739 / HPTN 084, 40 HIV incident infections had been identified: 4 
(0.20/100PY) in the CAB group and 36 (1.85/100PY) in the TDF/FTC group. One of these 4 infections 
was determined to be a prevalent infection following the primary analysis. In the CAB group, the 
incident rate was 0.15/100 PY and the TDF/FTC group was 1.85/100 PY. Based on this, the bias 
adjusted HR (95% CI) is 0.10 (0.04, 0.27).
In the CAB group:

2 HIV infections occurred in women with no recent oral CAB exposure and no injections:

1 in a participant who had completed Step 1; this participant was non-adherent to oral 
CAB based on plasma CAB concentrations, and the first HIV-positive visit occurred 7.4 
weeks after the end of Step 1
1 in a participant who was off CAB due to a temporary study-related discontinuation 
[i.e., due to becoming pregnant during OLI ~4 weeks post enrolment] and for whom 
the first HIV-positive visit occurred 52 weeks after the last quantifiable plasma CAB 
concentration).

2 HIV infections occurred during the injection phase of the study (i.e., during Step 2).
HIV genotyping results were available for 3 of the 4 CAB participants (1 did not have a viremic 
sample). 1 of the 3 participants had an integrase mutation at the first viremic visit (L74I); this 
mutation is considered to be a polymorphism and was also detected in several participants in the 
TDF/FTC group.
HIV genotyping results were obtained for 33 of the 36 incident infections in the TDF/FTC group. 1 
participant had both NRTI and NNRTI mutations. Eight other participants had NNRTI mutations alone. 
INSTI mutations/polymorphisms were detected in 10 samples.
Secondary Pharmacodynamics
In a Thorough QTc Study (LAI117009) CAB had no significant effect on cardiac repolarization at a 
supratherapeutic dose of 150 mg q 12 h x 3 doses.
The geometric mean CAB Cmax achieved in this study was approximately 3-fold higher than that of the 
standard clinical dose of 30 mg once daily at steady state and approximately 6-fold higher than that of 
the Q4W regimen at steady state.

Therefore, in combination with non-clinical studies, this data supports the lack of effect of CAB in QT 
prolongation.
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology
Pharmacokinetics
The main PK characteristics of Cabotegravir have been sufficiently well described based on data 
collected in healthy subjects and patient with HIV-1 infection. These include a flip-flop kinetics after IM 
administration with a Tmax of 7 days. After oral administration, a relative BE (oral/IM) of 0.76 and a 
Tmax of 3h was observed. No relevant food effect was observed. There is some distribution beyond 
plasma, but with low extent. Plasma protein is high (99.9% bound) with a B/P ratio of 0.52. 
Distribution of CAB in the mucosal tissues at sites of sexual transmission were strongly correlated and 
proportional to the plasma concentrations (tissue concentrations~10% to 20% of plasma 
concentrations over time). Elimination is mainly by metabolism, by UGT1A1 and UGT1A9 (minor) 
phase II reactions. 
The clinical studies and the population PK analysis led to the same conclusion that CAB can be 
administered without dose adjustment in subjects with mild to severe renal impairment (not on renal 
replacement therapy). Both population PK analysis and a dedicated clinical study show that CAB may 
be taken without dose adjustment in subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. 
Gender and race seem to have no clinically relevant impact on the PK of CAB after IM dosing. 
However, plasma CAB concentrations appeared to trend higher in participants <50 kg. 
Considering the proposed indication includes subjects weighting at least 35 kg, the applicant was 
requested to present data divided into narrower weight group; also, the number of subjects included in 
each group should be specified, in order to better analyse the impact of body weight in cabotegravir 
Assessment report 
EMA/360205/2023 
Page 59/150
exposure at both the oral lead-in phase and at steady state. Based on the applicant’s response, the 
exposure of CAB was shown higher for the <50 kg population. However, only AUC in these participants 
seem to be slightly above the observed values in the clinical trials. Both Cmax and Cmin values are 
contained within the previously observed values. No trends or safety concerns were identified for adult 
individuals weighing <50 kg suggesting a difference in safety profile or worse safety outcomes. This 
may indicate that the AUC is not a relevant marker in this respect.
Of major relevance for the current use of Cabotegravir for pre-exposure prophylaxis to reduce the risk 
of sexually acquired HIV-1 infection in at-risk individuals weighing at least 35 kg, similar plasma CAB 
exposure between healthy, HIV-1-infected, and high-risk participants has been observed. In fact, the 
Cabotegravir PopPK model was able to reliably describe and predict CAB PK from Studies HPTN 083 
and HPTN 084 although this population was not used in the model building procedures. Also, PK data 
for Cabotegravir in adolescents with HIV-infection (> 12 years and >35kg) is like healthy and HIV-
adults and, again, the previously developed popPK model could be used to both describe and predict 
the exposure in adolescents ≥35kg body weight. These conclusions support the extrapolation of data 
generated in healthy participants, such as drug and food interactions, renal and hepatic impairment, 
and the TQT study to these two target populations.
However, a certain degree in exposure variability has been observed, partially due to the low number 
of adolescents observed subjects. It is also noted that, during the CAB oral phase, about the 5% of the 
subjects weighting 35 < 50 kg could reach plasma concentration slightly above 22.5 µg/mL, which is 
highest exposure observed in clinical studies not associated with any toxicity. The Applicant, using 
PopPK simulations, confirmed that subjects with <50kg are predicted to have Cmax that may exceed 
the 22.5ug/mL, both at the OLI phase or after the CAB initiation injection. The applicant clarified that 
the Cmax limit of 22.5 µg/mL was, in fact, the geometric mean Cmax for participants (n=40) in Study 
LAI117009, the dedicated TQT study which did not identify significant safety risks. In this study, the 
Cmax in LAI117009 ranged from 16.9 to 39.2 ug/mL. None of the simulated subjects did result in 
values above the 39.2 ug/mL observed value. There is no clearly defined PK/PD model for CAB, but a 
Cmax below 22.5 (39.2) ug/mL has been shown to be safe, and it is hypothesized that a Cmin above 
0.664 ug/mL is required for efficacy. On the other side, the predicted 5th percentile of Ctau is just 
around the efficacy level and, thus, dose reduction would not be appropriate without a significant 
change in the interval of administration itself. Information was included in the SmPC stating that, 
although the exact time from initiation of Apretude for HIV-1 PrEP to maximal protection against HIV-1 
infection is unknown, based on model-predicted data, cabotegravir concentrations considered having 
significant antiviral activity (> 4x Protein Adjusted-IC90 i.e., 0.65 ug/mL) are reached and maintained 
shortly after the initiation of oral lead-in and, in case of no oral lead in is used, within 7 days after the 
first injection. 
Based on in vitro chelation studies, decrease of CAB exposure can be expected when orally 
administered CAB is co-administered with polyvalent cation-containing products such as antacids and 
also mineral supplements. The Applicant expects that the exposure will not decrease below the 10 mg 
oral CAB exposure. A warning is included in the SmPC to administer antacids at least 2 h before and 4 
h after oral CAB. In clinical studies, no significant effect was observed of rilpivirine on CAB. No clinically 
relevant effect of the weak/moderate UGT inducer etravirine was observed on CAB. The 
weak/moderate UGT inducer rifabutin reduced CAB AUC(0-tau), Cmax, and Ctau by 21%, 17%, and 
8%, respectively. Rifampicin, as a strong UGT1A1 inducer, reduced CAB AUC(0-inf) by 2.5-fold (59%) 
and C24 by 2-fold (50%). Co-administration of CAB with rifampicin and other strong UGT1A1 inducers 
is contra-indicated, which is agreed. No clinical studies were performed with UGT inhibitors. The 
Applicant concludes that it is not necessary to perform DDI studies with UGT inhibitors based on the 
pharmacogenetics analysis in which in subjects with low UGT1A1 activity exposure to CAB was shown 
to increase by approximately 1.5-fold. In vitro studies indicate no clinically relevant induction of 
Assessment report 
EMA/360205/2023 
Page 60/150
CYP1A2 (induction via AhR), 2B6 (induction via CAR) and 3A4 (induction via PXR) by CAB. In vitro 
studies indicate no clinically relevant inhibition of cytochrome P450. In vitro studies indicate no 
clinically relevant inhibition of UGT except UGT1A3 in case of oral administration. In case of oral 
administration, inhibition of UGT1A3 in the intestine cannot be excluded. In vitro studies indicate no 
clinically relevant inhibition of P-gp, BCRP, MRP2, MRP4, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, OCT2, BSEP, 
MATE1, and MATE2-K. Based on in vitro studies, inhibition of OAT1 and OAT3 by CAB cannot be 
excluded. PBPK modelling predicted an increase of CAB exposure of maximally 25%. However, 
considering the low IC50 values found in the in vitro study and the fact that use of CAB/RPV in 
combination with OAT1/OAT3 substrates is very likely to occur a word of caution was included in the 
SmPC. Clinical DDI studies were performed with orally administered CAB. In clinical studies, CAB had 
no significant effect on rilpivirine, ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel and CYP3A substrate midazolam. 
In vitro studies indicate that CAB glucuronide does not inhibit MDR1, BCRP, BSEP, MRP2, MRP4, 
OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2-K to a clinically relevant extent. Inhibition of OAT1 and 
OAT3 was observed. 
Pharmacodynamics
A significant part of the clinical pharmacology program is based on the development of cabotegravir for 
the treatment of HIV-1 infection. The focus of the following assessment is more focus on the studies 
most relevant for the indication intended for Apretude, the pre-exposure prophylaxis to reduce the risk 
of sexually acquired HIV-1 infection in high-risk adults and adolescents.
CAB is a potent in vitro inhibitor of HIV integrase and inhibits the integrase catalysed viral DNA strand 
transfer with IC50 values in the nanomolar range (3.0 to 13 nM).
The susceptibility of 13 clinically diverse HIV-1 subtype B isolates to integrase inhibition by CAB was 
tested. The mean IC50 for viral replication of the clinical isolate based viruses was 1.3 nM (range 1.0 
to 1.6 nM). CAB was highly active with broad activity against all HIV-1 and HIV-2 isolates tested. 
CAB was evaluated for antiviral activity against a panel of 11 non-HIV viruses. In general, CAB did not 
exhibit significant antiviral activity in this panel although some activity was observed against 
rhinovirus.
HIV-infected adolescents (Age 12-<18 years and ≥35 kg) were administered with CAB 30 mg once 
daily orally for at least 4 weeks (up to a maximum of 6 weeks) in addition to cART, followed by 3 
intramuscular (IM) injections of CAB LA, each separated by 4 weeks (600 mg for the first injection and 
400 mg for the second and third injections), in addition to cART.
Eight enrolled participants were assigned to Cohort 1C comprising of 6 males and 2 females, with a 
mean (range) age of 14.9 (12 - 17) years.
All participants were virologically suppressed to <50 c/mL at Week 16, and there were no incidents of 
confirmed virologic failure through the Cohort 1 Week 16 interim analysis. Thus, no resistance data are 
available for summary.
The observed PK and safety data from this study support the acceptability of the use of the adult CAB 
monthly dosing regimen in adolescents.
In HIV-1-infected participants who were naïve or off all ART for at least 12 weeks, oral CAB 
monotherapy regimens of 5 mg once daily and 30 mg once daily achieved mean decreases in plasma 
HIV-1 RNA of >2.1 log10 c/mL on Day 11 with geometric mean CAB Ctau of 0.57 µg/mL (3.43x PA-
IC90) for CAB 5 mg once daily and 3.28 µg/mL (19.8x PA-IC90) for CAB 30 mg once daily. There was 
no clear relationship between plasma CAB PK parameters and reduction in plasma HIV-1 RNA

EMA/360205/2023 
Page 61/150
concentrations due to the strong antiviral response observed for the two oral CAB monotherapy 
regimens of 5 mg once daily and 30 mg once daily.
In healthy participants, in study HPTN 083, geometric mean plasma CAB concentrations 1-week and 4-
weeks post- initial injection were 2.90 µg/mL (>4x PA-IC90) and 1.86 µg/mL (>4x PA-IC90), 
respectively, in participants who did not acquire HIV infection. At steady state (Week 49), geometric 
mean CAB plasma concentrations were 1.72 µg/mL, (>4x PA-IC90). PK in cisgender women in HPTN 
084 were similar to those observed in MSM and TGW in HPTN 083. In Study 201767, CAB 
concentrations after a single 600 mg IM injection were measured in plasma and in cervical, vaginal, 
and rectal tissues and in cervical and rectal fluid. Tissue and plasma CAB concentrations were strongly 
correlated and proportional (tissue concentrations ~10% to 20% of plasma concentrations) over time. 
The clinical relevance of tissue or fluid concentrations is uncertain in the setting of HIV prevention. 
However, the plasma PK data from HPTN 083 suggests that pre-dose tissue concentrations >1x PA-
IC90 (0.166 g/mL) would be expected in tissues at sites of sexual transmission for PrEP based on the 
distribution into mucosal tissues observed in Study 201767.
Analysis of resistance to CAB resulted in the identification of the following mutations: Q146L, S153Y, 
S153F and I162M. Starting with mutants at IN position 148 (H, K, or R), the following additional 
mutations emerged after passaging with CAB: G56S, V72I, L74M, V75A, T122N, E138K, G140S, 
G149A, and M154I. CAB FC for various combinations of these mutations with Q148H/K/R ranged from 
2.2 to 410, relative to that observed for NL432.
Comparative susceptibilities to CAB, DTG and RAL showed anti-HIV activity (susceptibility) with fold 
change (FC) <5 against 22 of 25 INI-resistant mutant viruses with single mutations; for DTG there 
were 24/25 mutant viruses with FC <5. While both CAB and DTG had >5-FC with G118R, only CAB had 
>5 FC with Q148K and Q148R. 
Among the multiple mutants, the highest FC for CAB was observed with mutants containing Q148K or 
Q148R.
Clinical trial isolates from seroconversion in previously healthy participants revealed INSTI 
mutations/polymorphisms (V151I, L74I, E138K, G140S, Q148R, E157Q, G140A), as well as NNRTI and 
NRTI associated mutations.
Although no direct clear exposure-response relationship exists, the doses selected lead to plasma CAB 
concentrations >4x PA-IC90 (1-week and 4-weeks post-injection and at steady-state at 49-weeks). 
Tissue and plasma CAB concentrations were strongly correlated and proportional (tissue concentrations 
~10% to 20% of plasma concentrations) over time.
2.5.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology
Pharmacokinetics
The population PK analysis with both adolescent and adult PK data seems to allow extrapolation of PK 
in uninfected adolescents, showing no significant differences in PK parameters.
Pharmacodynamics
The overall clinical pharmacodynamics program is considered adequate to support the use of CAB in 
the proposed indication.

2.5.5.  Clinical efficacy
The clinical development program consists of 2 randomized pivotal studies (Phase IIb/III study 
201738/HPTN 083 and Phase III study 201739/HPTN 084) supported by 2 randomized, placebo-
controlled studies (study 201120 ÉCLAIR and study 201103/HPTN 077).
The discussed indication is:
Apretude is indicated in combination with safer sex practices for pre-exposure prophylaxis to reduce 
the risk of sexually acquired HIV-1 infection in high-risk adults and adolescents, weighing at least 35 
kg (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1).

2.5.5.1.  Dose response studies
The Cabotegravir dose rationale was based on maintaining Cabotegravir dose concentrations 4 times 
greater that the in vitro protein-adjusted 90% inhibitory concentration (PA-IC90) value of 0.166  
µg/mL (i.e., 0.664 µg/mL), a concentration range shown to have significant antiviral activity in vitro 
and in Phase IIa monotherapy studies used for the approval of the use of Cabotegravir in HIV-1 
infected participants (in combination with rilpivirine).  
CAB 30 mg once daily has been used as OLI in supportive PrEP studies HPTN 077 and Study 201120. 
similar CAB concentrations were observed at the end of OLI after 30 mg once daily as observed in 
Study LAI116482. As such, this oral dose was selected for use as OLI in the CAB PrEP Phase III 
studies.
From the data presented the timing to achieve 4x PA-IC90 of 0.664 μg/mL was similar in population on 
CAB submitted to OLI and the ones in the DTI group. 
According with the data presented and the safety profile of CAB OLI can be optional (this can be of 
value in population with low adherence (oral or other), but the OLI CAB should continue to be optional 
to the provider and/or individual), according with the applicant. 
The Injection Phase of the dosing regimen used in the pivotal studies HPTN 083 and HPTN 084 is 
initiated by 2 injections (single 600 mg, 3 mL IM) administered 4 weeks apart, with subsequent 
injections administered Q8W. This is the same dose used for HIV1 treatment in combination with 
rilpivirine. 
In Phase IIa HPTN 077 LA 800 mg IM Q12W (i.e., Cohort 1) in healthy male and female participants, 
was amended to enrol a second cohort (i.e., Cohort 2) with dosing of CAB LA 600 mg IM at 2 time 
points 4 weeks apart and Q8W thereafter for 3 injection visits. In HPTN 077, male participants in 
Cohort 1 did not consistently achieve target trough concentrations therefore, a regimen of CAB LA 800 
mg Q12W may not maintain sufficient exposures in all participants, particularly in males. CAB LA 600 
mg Q8W achieved target trough concentrations in both male and female participants in Cohort 2 in 
HPTN 077. 
Study 208580 evaluated the use of the adult Q4W CAB regimen in HIV-infected adolescents (age 12 
years to <18 years and >=35 kg) and provided PK and safety data that were considered supportive of 
the proposed indication for the use of the adult CAB PrEP regimen in individuals weighing at least 35 
kg. The same dosing used for HIV1 treatment in adolescents.
The CAB PopPK model that includes body size parameters was utilized to extrapolate exposures and 
propose the dose for adolescents weighing at least 35 kg in Study 208580.Please refer to the PK and 
safety section for more detail.

Figure 6 illustrates the study design and randomization scheme of HPTN 084.
Figure 6: Study 201739 / HPTN 084 Study Design
Due to meeting pre-specified stopping criteria for superiority of CAB LA to TDF/FTC, the blinded, 
randomized portion of the study was stopped early. 
Pregnancies
Regardless of the randomization assignment or point in the study, all pregnant participants were to be 
placed on open-label TDF/FTC at the first positive pregnancy test visit and if confirmed for the duration 
of the pregnancy and breastfeeding. No participant with a positive pregnancy test was to be 
administered CAB, CAB LA, or CAB LA placebo. Once pregnancy outcome was reached, if the

participant was not breastfeeding, or once the participant finished breastfeeding, she could resume 
unblinded study product and visits according to the SOE.
The main difference in the two pivotal studies above is the population included MSM and TGW in HTPN 
083 and women in HTPN 084. The design between both is similar, but, of note HTPN 084 is a 
superiority study and HTPN083 is a non-inferiority study. Both use as comparator TDF/FTC.
Methods
Study Participants
Main Inclusion criteria 
In both studies the main inclusion criteria was to have an HIV negative test. The in- and exclusion 
criteria reflect a population above 18 years old, sexually active, that should benefit from PrEP, MSM 
and TGW (HTPN083) or born female (HTPN084) with an exclusion in both studies of AgHBs positive 
patients, which is acceptable taking into account the comparator used.
Regarding the risk of acquiring HIV infection the inclusion criteria were:
Study 083
At high risk for sexually acquiring HIV infection based on self-report of at least one of the following:
-Any condomless receptive anal intercourse in the 6 months prior to Enrolment (condomless anal 
intercourse within monogamous HIV seronegative concordant relationship does not meet this criterion)
-More than 5 partners in the 6 months prior to Enrolment (regardless of condom use and HIV 
serostatus, as reported by the enrolee)
-Any stimulant drug use in the 6 months prior to Enrolment
-Rectal or urethral gonorrhoea or chlamydia or incident syphilis in the 6 months prior to Enrolment
-SexPro score of ≤16 (US sites only)
Study 084
-Sexually active (i.e., vaginal intercourse on a minimum of two separate days in the 30 days prior to 
Screening)
-Score of ≥5 using a modified VOICE risk score* [Balkus, 2016]
*NOTE: Protocol Version 1.0 (02-Mar-2017) permitted enrolment of women who scored >2 using a 
modified VOICE Risk Score. Protocol Version 1.0 was updated on 06 November 2019 to allow 
enrolment of women who scored ≥5 using a modified VOICE risk score to target women at higher risk 
of HIV acquisition.
Some population groups that could benefit from PrEP with cabotegravir were excluded from the clinical 
trials, mainly those with an active or recent use of illicit intravenous drugs, hepatitis C positive, and 
pregnant women.
For the blinded phase of the HPTN 083 and 084 studies, HIV testing was performed at study sites 
following testing algorithms. The testing algorithm at the screening (Figure 11.1 from the SPP manual), 
Enrolment (Figure 11.2 from the SPP manual), and follow-up visits (Figure 11.1 from the SPP manual), 
included a rapid HIV test that was cleared by the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) and a laboratory-based antigen-Ab (Ag/Ab) test. In addition, an HIV viral load was performed 
Assessment report 
EMA/360205/2023 
Page 67/150
within 14 days before Enrolment. The participant was not eligible for study Enrolment if any of the HIV 
tests from the Screening visit, the HIV RNA test performed prior to the Enrolment visit, or the rapid 
HIV test from the Enrolment visit was reactive or positive.
In these cases, HIV status was determined based on local testing guidelines. After Enrolment, if the 
rapid HIV test or the Ag/Ab test was reactive, an HIV RNA test was performed. The first site-positive 
visit was defined as the first visit near the time of HIV diagnosis at when a reactive or positive HIV test 
was obtained at a study site (Marzinke 2021).
Samples from all cases where a reactive or positive HIV test result was obtained at study sites were 
analysed retrospectively at the HPTN Laboratory Center to determine HIV status. Assays used 
included: qualitative RNA test: Aptima HIV-1 RNA Qualitative Assay; HIV-1 Viral Load: Abbott 
RealTime HIV-1 Viral Load Assay; Ag/Ab test: Architect HIV Ag/Ab Combo assay; confirmatory Ab test: 
Geenius HIV 1/2 Supplemental Assay. This testing was performed at the first visit where a reactive or 
positive test result was obtained at the study site. If a reactive qualitative RNA test result was 
obtained, back testing was performed with the same assay at prior study visits until a non-reactive 
result was obtained. The HPTN Laboratory Center classified participants as HIV Positive if they had a 
positive qualitative RNA test or a positive confirmatory Ab test (Marzinke 2021; Eshleman 2022).
HIV test results from study sites and the HPTN Laboratory Center were reviewed by an External 
Independent Endpoint Adjudication Committee for all cases where at least one reactive or positive HIV 
test was obtained at the study site. The adjudication committee decided on HIV status and identified 
the first HIV-positive visit based on the available data. Confirmation of HIV infection by the 
adjudication committee required a positive RNA test, a positive confirmatory Ab test, or a positive HIV 
DNA test with a result above the lower limit of quantification (Marzinke 2021; Eshleman 2022).

Treatments
In both studies the CAB oral, CAB LA and TDF/FTC used were the same that the already approved for 
the treatment of HIV 1 infection.
Regarding the blinding process, all study site staff, apart from the site Pharmacist of Record or their 
designee, were blinded to the random assignments. All study products were stored in the pharmacy 
according to the temperatures noted above. Intralipid 20% suspension was chosen as the matching 
‘placebo’ as it is similar in colour, opacity, and consistency to CAB LA suspension. The unblinded site 
pharmacist prepared the injections in the pharmacy. Syringes were covered with an overlay by the 
Pharmacist of Record prior to dispensing to the study clinic as an extra precaution to maintain the 
blind. The injections were labelled in a blinded fashion as “CAB LA 600 mg or Placebo for CAB LA”, 
including the volume (3 mL), route (IM), participant’s ID, date and time of preparation, and date and 
time of expiration. The active or placebo injections were then delivered to the clinic for administration. 
The person responsible for administering the injections was blinded to the study intervention. 
Objectives

Study 201738/HTPN 083
This was a non-inferiority study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CAB LA for PrEP in HIV 
uninfected cisgender men and TGW who have sex with men (MSM and TGW). 
Assessment report 
EMA/360205/2023 
Page 70/150
Primary
-
-
To compare HIV incidence among participants randomized to oral CAB/CAB LA(oral lead in and 
injections) vs. oral TDF/FTC (Steps 1 and 2).
To compare the safety of oral CAB/CAB LA vs. oral TDF/FTC (Steps 1 and 2).

Study 201739/HTPN 084
This was a superiority study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CAB LA for PrEP in HIV 
uninfected women. 
Primary Objectives
-
-
Efficacy: To evaluate the relative efficacy of oral CAB/CAB LA (oral run-in and injections, Steps 
1 and 2) vs. daily oral TDF/FTC for HIV prevention (Steps 1 and 2).
Safety: To evaluate the relative safety of oral CAB/CAB LA (oral run-in and injections, Steps 1 
and 2) vs. daily oral TDF/FTC for HIV prevention (Steps 1 and 2).
The objectives of both the studies are considered relevant and appropriate. The main objectives are 
the same in the two studies. 
Outcomes/endpoints
The primary endpoints are equal for both studies:
Efficacy endpoint: Number of documented incident HIV infections in Steps 1 and 2
Safety endpoint: Grade 2 or higher clinical and laboratory adverse events
They match the objectives of the studies and are acceptable. There are some minor differences in 
other than the primary endpoints in relation with the population studied.
Sample size 
Sample size in Study HPTN 083 was calculated based on the NIM; the NIM was well justified.
Standard methods for sample size calculation were applied in Study HTPN 084, interim analysis was 
carefully planned and stopping rules were defined using a robust method. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking)
The central randomisation with 1:1 ratio to study and control treatment and the proposed stratification 
factors study HTPN083 are acceptable; randomization was stratified by study site, and permuted 
blocks design was used to ensure balanced treatment assignments within study site. Block size was 8, 
10, or 12, with 8 blocks per stratum. The same is true to study HTPN 084.
Study 201738/HTPN 083 and Study 201739/HTPN 084 were double blind and active controlled 
(Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate/Emtricitabine)
Assessment report 
EMA/360205/2023 
Page 71/150
Statistical methods
Standard statistical analysis methods were applied in both HPTN 083 and HPTN 084.
In both studies, the absolute efficacy of PrEP has been a function of the level of risk in the treated 
population and of the adherence to prophylaxis. Thus, assay sensitivity could not have been 
ascertained. It should be noted that defining an appropriate NI-margin was raised as a major concern 
by the SAWP/CHMP in Scientific advice (EMEA/H/SA/2517/2/FU/1/2015/III). 
Analysis followed the SAP proposed analysis for the primary outcome. Stopping rules for the Interim 
analysis were calculated using a robust and valid method.

Figure 10: Participant disposition 
There were 1879 screen failures, of those 231 were HIV infected, but 342 were not enrolled due to the 
opinion of the study investigator. The main reason for not providing details of the study investigator´s 
opinion for not enrolling a participant, was that that information was not requested and now it is 
impossible to obtain. At this point that information cannot be obtained; it was important to ascertain if 
any “investigator opinion” could influence the data/utilization of Cabotegravir in PrEP in a real-life 
setting. 
Reasons for treatment discontinuation were similar between both groups, with the exception of the 
ones related with the injectable treatment.

There were 1551 screen failures, of those 205 were HIV infected, but 297 (27%) were not enrolled due 
to a medical condition that in the opinion of the study investigator would interfere with the conduct of 
the study. The main reason for not providing details of the medical conditions that, in the opinion of 
the investigator, would interfere with the conduct of the study was that that information was not 
requested and now it is impossible to obtain. As stated previously, at this point, that information 
cannot be obtained; it was important to ascertain if any “investigator opinion” could influence the 
data/utilization of Cabotegravir in PrEP in a real-life setting. 
Reasons for treatment discontinuation were similar between both groups.
Recruitment

Study 201738/HTPN 083
This was a multicentre study conducted at 43 HPTN-affiliated centers in: United States (27 centers), 
Peru (5 centers), Brazil (4 centers), Argentina (2 centers), Thailand (3 centers), Vietnam (1 centre), 
and South Africa (1 centre). The first participant was enrolled on 19 December 2016.
Assessment report 
EMA/360205/2023


Study 201739/HTPN 084
This was a multicentre study conducted at 20 centers in SSA: Botswana, Kenya, Malawi, South Africa, 
eSwatini [formerly Swaziland], Uganda, and Zimbabwe. The first participant was enrolled on 27 
November 2017.
Of note, no European patient was included in both studies. In HTPN084 only women from SSA were 
included. 
Conduct of the study
Protocol amendments
The protocol deviations reported in both studies were similar in both study arms and did not seem to 
impact in the studies efficacy results reported.
In HTPN083, one DAIDS Clinical Research site failed to follow the study algorithm concerning HIV 
testing, required to be performed within 14 days of enrolment. This deviation was present in 20 
subjects that were tested based on stored samples and were all negative. Although no alteration to the 
analysis resulted from the deviation this must be considered a major deviation.
In HPTN084, the Applicant confirmed that the under-dosing that took place at a site that was not 
related to any HIV infection. No HIV infections were seen at this site in the HPTN 084 study. 
Although the Implementation of non-IRB-Approved Consent Form and Participant Letter in the 
Tsepamo study (HTPN 084) was a protocol deviation it did not seem to have an impact in the final 
results.
Baseline data
Baseline characteristics were well balanced between the two arms of the studies. HTPN 083 only 
including MSM and TGW and HTPN084 only including cis women.
Baseline STIs were also similar between the two arms in both studies.
In HPTN 083, inclusion/exclusion assessment was done as part of eligibility prior to enrolment and was 
entirely separate from the demographics questionnaire assessed subsequently - the latter of which 
people may have refused to answer. Age and identity were confirmed for every participant at every 
visit per DAIDS (sponsor) policy. Four participants preferred not to answer the demographic 
questionnaire, but site staff requested demographic information for inclusion consideration.
In both clinical studies none of the subjects included was below 18 years of age.
In Study HTPN 083 the majority of subjects were < 30 years old (with a median age of 26 years), MSM 
and with a SexPro Score ≤ 16.
In study 084 the majority were < 35 years women with a median age of 25 years, black, a MBI < 30 
Kg/m2 and had a screening modified VOICE risk score of ≥5. Just over half of participants had a main 
or primary partner. 
Therefore, the majority of subjects in both studies were at higher risk of HIV acquisition.

Outcomes and estimation
HTPN083
Primary efficacy endpoint
52 HIV infections had occurred in both groups combined. 
13 infections occurred in the CAB group:
-3 in OLI phase
-5 while the patient was receiving CAB LA injections 
-5 following periods when the patient was off CAB (oral or LA), probably due to non-adherence or 
study discontinuation
-1 already infected at baseline
39 infections occurred in the TDF/FTC group and 37/39 where related to non-adherence (based in PK 
assessments in DBS samples).
At blinded study termination, 52 HIV-1 incident infections were identified, 13 in the CAB group, for an 
incidence of 0.40 per 100 PY, and 39 in the TDF/FTC group, for an incidence of 1.22 per 100 PY.
Following the primary analysis, extended retrospective virologic testing was performed to better 
characterise the timing of HIV infections. As a result, one of the 13 incident infections on cabotegravir 
was determined to be a prevalent infection. Therefore, in the CAB group, there were 12 incident HIV-1 
infections/3211 PY (for an incidence of 0.37 per 100 PY); and in the TDF/FTC group, there were 39 
incident HIV-1 infections/3193 PY (for an incidence of 1.22 per 100 PY). Based on this, the revised bias 
adjusted HR (95% CI) is 0.31 (0.16 to 0.58).
Consistent with the outcome of the HPTN 083 primary analysis, this supportive analysis with OBSP 
censoring demonstrated that treatment with CAB LA was superior (p=0.0008) to treatment with oral 
TDF/FTC for the prevention of HIV-1 acquisition, according with the applicant. The HR of 0.164 (95% 
CI: 0.06 to 0.47) indicates an 83.6% reduction in the incidence of HIV-1 infections for the CAB group 
compared with the TDF/FTC group while participants remained on blinded injection study product.

Figure 12: Kaplan Meier plot to Display the Cumulative Rates of Acquired HIV-infections by

Secondary efficacy analyses
Incident HIV-1 infections in Step 2 Only
In this analysis, the HR of 0.210 (95% CI: 0.10 to 0.45) indicates a 79.0% reduction in the incidence 
of HIV-1 infections for the CAB group compared with the TDF/FTC group during Step 2 of the study, 
when the active drug received by participants was either IM injections of CAB LA every 2 months or 
oral TDF/FTC once daily.
Resistance mutations to study products (including but not limited to K65R, M184V/L, Q148R) among 
seroconverters
HIV genotyping results were obtained for 12 of the 15 CAB cases (1 failed analysis and 2 had no 
viremic visits). Three participants in the CAB group had integrase resistance mutations. One participant 
is from Latin America, has HIV subtype B infection, and had integrase mutations L74I and Q148R at 
the first viremic visit. Another participant also from Latin America, has HIV subtype B infection, and 
had integrase mutations E138A and Q148R at the first viremic visit. One of the 5 participants with HIV 
infections despite on-time CAB injections had integrase mutations G140A and Q148R. This participant 
is from Africa and has HIV subtype C infection.
3 of the participants who acquired HIV infection had a major INSTI mutation Q148R (2 subtype B while 
on oral CAB, 1 subtype C while on LA CAB with no record of non-adherence).
Three additional CAB participants with HIV infection had NNRTI resistance at the first viremic visit; one 
of those participants also had NRTI resistance. 
None of the 3 participants with Baseline infections had resistance. Twelve participants with incident 
infection had resistance at the first viremic visit; 7 had NNRTI resistance only, 1 had NRTI resistance 
only, 1 had a single PI resistance mutation only, and 3 had NNRTI and NRTI resistance.
Assessment report 
EMA/360205/2023 
Page 77/150
The 4 participants with NRTI resistance (including 3 who had multi-class resistance) included 3 with 
M184V/I and 1 with K65R. These mutations could have been selected by TDF/FTC.
HTPN084
Primary efficacy endpoint
For HPTN 084, results of the primary efficacy endpoint analyses demonstrated that the PrEP regimen of 
every 2 months injections of CAB LA was superior (p<0.0001) to the daily oral regimen of TDF/FTC in 
preventing acquisition of HIV-1 infection based on the rate of incident HIV-1 infections in Steps 1 and 
2. At blinded study termination, 40 HIV-1 incident infections were identified, 4 in the CAB group, for an 
incidence of 0.20 per 100 PY, and 36 in the TDF/FTC group, for an incidence of 1.85 per 100 PY. Of the 
4 incident HIV-1 infections reported for the CAB group in the primary analysis, timing for detection is 
as follows:
- 1 seroconversion due to non-adherence.
-1 seroconversion was detected when the participant was off CAB due to a temporary study-related 
discontinuation (i.e., due to pregnancy); this participant became pregnant during OLI ~4 weeks post 
Enrolment and was offered open-label TDF/FTC; the first HIV-positive visit for this participant occurred 
57 weeks post Enrolment and 52 weeks after the last quantifiable plasma CAB concentration; thus, at 
the time of seroconversion, this participant had no recent oral CAB exposure and had not received any 
CAB injections.
-2 seroconversions were detected during Step 2 while the participants were receiving CAB injections.
For the TDF/FTC group, seroconversion events were largely due to low adherence to the daily PrEP 
regimen based on PK findings.
One of the 4 incident infections was determined to be a prevalent infection following the primary 
analysis. Therefore, in the CAB group, the incident rate was 0.15/100 PY and the TDF/FTC group was 
1.85/100 PY. Based on this, the bias adjusted HR (95% CI) is 0.10 (0.04, 0.27).

Secondary efficacy analyses
Secondary analysis to compare HIV incidence among participants receiving oral CAB/CAB LA vs. daily 
oral TDF/FTC (Steps 1, 2 and 3) was not performed as no participants had reached Step 3 at the time 
of the analysis and was therefore no different from the primary analysis.
Incident HIV-1 infections in Step 2 Only
This secondary analysis, demonstrated that treatment with the CAB regimen was superior (p<0.0001) 
to treatment with the TDF/FTC regimen for the prevention of HIV-1 acquisition in Step 2 of the clinical 
study. In this analysis, the HR of 0.06 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.24) indicates a 94% reduction in the incidence 
of HIV-1 infections for the CAB group compared with the TDF/FTC group during Step 2 of the study 
(i.e., during the Blinded Injection Phase, when the active drug was either IM injections of CAB LA every 
2 months or oral TDF/FTC once daily).
Resistance mutations to study products (including but not limited to K65R, M184V/L, Q148R) among 
seroconverters
HIV genotyping results were available for 3 of the 4 CAB participants (one did not have a viremic 
sample). One of the 3 participants had an integrase mutation at the first viremic visit (L74I). None had 
a major INSTI mutation.
Results were obtained for 33 of the 36 incident infections in the TDF/FTC group (2 failed testing; 1 had 
no viremic sample). One participant had a major NRTI mutation (M184V); this participant also had 
NNRTI resistance with the K103N mutation.
Eight other participants had NNRTI resistance only (6 had K103N, alone or with E138A or P225H; 1 
had K101E alone; 1 had E138A alone). INSTI mutations/polymorphisms were detected in 10 samples 
(L74I, L74M, T97A, V151I, E157Q, G193E). For the participant with dual-class (NRTI+NNRTI)

resistance, the first viremic visit was the same as the first site positive visit (at Step 2, Week 17; 33 
days after the first HIV positive visit). This participant was classified as non-adherent to TDF/FTC PrEP 
based on plasma TFV and DBS TFV-DP concentrations at time of the first HIV positive visit.
Ongoing data HTPN083 and HTPN084
Although no new efficacy issues arise from the data presented, it is noted that during the additional 
follow-up: 
-
-
-
46 subjects developed incident HIV infection in the preplanned analysis period (13 CAB, 33 
TDF/FTC, 4 during the blinded phase and 42 after unblinding);
Risk reduction for CAB-LA vs. FTC/TDF remained similar in blinded and unblinded phases;
HIV incidence was higher in both arms in the unblinded phase, likely attributable to decreased 
TDF/FTC adherence, reduced CAB injection coverage, and increased relative contributions to 
overall person-time from high-incidence region; 
-
No new safety concerns were identified.
Further, additional data on early detection of HIV infection and INSTI resistance in the blinded phase of 
HPTN 083 presented at CROI 2022 were provided. The findings supported the language in the US 
package insert and recent guidance from the US CDC for HIV testing in the setting of CAB-LA PrEP. The 
author concluded that earlier detection of HIV infection using an HIV RNA assay in the setting of CAB-
LA PrEP would allow for earlier ART initiation, potentially reducing the risk of INSTI resistance. She also 
concluded that in the context of proven high efficacy, CAB-LA should also be considered for HIV PrEP in 
settings where HIV RNA screening is not readily available.

In summary, no relation was found between subgroups and HIV infection in both clinical studies, in 
HPTN 083 based on region, age, race, ethnicity, gender identity, and Baseline risk factor and HTPN 084 
based on age and BMI. The same was true for patients <25 years of age.
Patient-Reported Outcomes
Regarding Patient-Reported Outcomes, the Study Medication Satisfaction Questionnaire (SMSQ) used 
in HPTN 083 to evaluate participant-reported tolerability of and satisfaction with the study drugs in 
Study 083 showed a similar (≥60) median satisfaction scores for participants in CAB and TDF/FTC 
groups which were consistent across all visits. However, it was noted that for injections, the scores 
were slightly higher in TDF/FTC group compared to CAB group across all visits. 
In HPTN 084 a similar proportion of participants in both study groups reported no pain or discomfort 
with the oral study medication (CAB group: 56%; TDF/FTC group: 52%). In contrast, there were fewer 
participants who reported no pain or discomfort with the injection with small proportional differences 
by treatment group (CAB group: 43%; TDF/FTC group: 52%). Similar patterns of treatment 
satisfaction were noted for participants <25 years of age between treatment groups and across study 
visits

Title: A Phase IIb/III Double Blind Safety and Efficacy Study of Injectable Cabotegravir (CAB) 
Compared to Daily Oral Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate/Emtricitabine (TDF/FTC), For Pre-Exposure 
Prophylaxis in HIV-Uninfected Cisgender Men and Transgender Women who have Sex with Men
Study identifier
Study 201738 (HPTN 083); NCT02720094
Design
Hypothesis
This study was a Phase IIb/III, multi-site, double-blind, two-arm, 
randomized (1:1), controlled non-inferiority study in HIV-uninfected 
cisgender men and transgender women who have sex with men (MSM and 
TGW).  
Participants were randomized to the CAB or TDF/FTC group on Day 1.  
Participants in the CAB group received daily oral active CAB (30 mg tablet) 
and oral placebo TDF/FTC for 4 weeks (up to 5◦weeks allowed for any 
delays in testing results) during Step 1 (Oral Lead-in [OLI] Phase), followed 
by active CAB LA (Cabotegravir long-acting injectable, extended release 
suspension for injection) injections (600 mg IM injection at 2 timepoints 
4 weeks apart and then Q8W thereafter) and daily oral placebo TDF/FTC 
during Step 2 (Injection Phase).  Participants in the TDF/FTC group received 
daily oral active TDF/FTC (300 mg/200 mg FDC [Fixed-dose combination] 
tablets) and oral placebo CAB for 4 weeks (up to 5◦weeks allowed for any 
delays in testing results) during Step 1 (OLI Phase), followed by daily oral 
active TDF/FTC (300 mg/200 mg FDC tablets) and IM placebo injections 
during Step 2 (Injection Phase).  Participants in each group received 
placebo on the same dosing schedule and with matching vehicle as the drug 
in the other group.  At Week 153, participants in both groups received 
open-label daily oral TDF/FTC for 48 weeks (Step 3).
The population included adult (age 18 years or older) cisgender MSM and 
TGW who have sex with men who were HIV-negative and at high risk of 
sexual acquisition of HIV infection.
Duration of Step 1 (OLI Phase): For 4 weeks (up to 5 weeks allowed for 
any delays in testing results)
Duration of Step 2 (Injection Phase): From End of Step 1 to Week 153
Duration of Step 3 (Follow-up Phase): Offered at Week 153 and continued 
for 48 weeks
 In this non-inferiority trial, the null hypothesis was HR=1.23 and the 
design alternative was HR=0.75.  Once non-inferiority was established, a 
superiority test was performed.

(i.e. Week 153 or the study-wide transition to Step 3, or end of the blinded 
phase of the study, whichever occurred first).
Per the ITT principle, person time and endpoint events were included in the 
primary analysis regardless of whether participants remained on their 
blinded study product, including when participants moved to open-label 
TDF/FTC (Step 3) early.

Analysis population and 
time point description
Injection (Step 2) Efficacy Population: The mITT population who received at 
least one injection and were uninfected at the time of the first injection.
Analysis period: Follow-up time included primary analysis study time from 
the time of the first injection through the completion of the blinded injection 
phase of study follow-up.
On Blinded Study Product (OBSP) Efficacy Analysis:  To support the non-
inferiority hypothesis, a supportive analysis was presented using the OBSP 
censoring in the Injection (Step 2) Efficacy population, where study follow-
up was censored when a participant did not receive blinded injection study 
product on time. 
Censoring:
Censoring for the OBSP efficacy analysis excluded any time affected by 
delayed injections.  Participants were censored the first time an injection 
was delayed, which was defined as follows:
For STEP 2:
1. Last non-delayed injection:  The earliest of an injection whose 
subsequent injection was delayed for the first time (i.e. given >6 weeks 
after the Week 5 injection or >10 weeks after any other injection) or the 
last injection before a termination or a permanent product discontinuation.
2. For participants with a delayed injection, follow-up time was censored at 
the last visit with HIV status determined up through 6 weeks after the Week 
5 injection, if that was the last non-delayed injection, or 10 weeks after the 
last non-delayed injection for subsequent injections.
3. For participants with no delayed injections, analysis time was defined as 
for primary efficacy analysis.

Design
This study is an ongoing Phase III, multi-center, double-blind, two-arm, randomized 
(1:1), controlled superiority study of the safety and efficacy of CAB LA compared to 
daily oral TDF/FTC for HIV prevention in a population of sexually-active HIV-
uninfected women at risk for HIV.
Participants were randomized to the CAB or TDF/FTC group on Day 1.  Participants 
in the CAB group received daily oral active CAB (30 mg tablets) and oral placebo 
TDF/FTC for 4 weeks (up to 5 weeks allowed for any delays in testing results) during 
Step 1 (OLI Phase), followed by active CAB LA injections (600 mg IM injection at 
2 timepoints 4 weeks apart and then Q8W thereafter) and oral placebo TDF/FTC 
until the required number of incident HIV endpoints (114) was accrued during 
Step 2 (Injection Phase).  Participants in the TDF/FTC group received daily oral 
active TDF/FTC (300 mg/200 mg FDC tablets) and oral placebo CAB for 4 weeks (up 
to 5 weeks allowed for any delays in testing results) during Step 1 (OLI Phase), 
followed by daily oral active TDF/FTC (300 mg/200 mg FDC tablets) and IM placebo 
injections until the required number of incident HIV endpoints (114) was accrued 
during Step 2 (Injection Phase).  Participants in each group received placebo on the 
same dosing schedule and with matching vehicle as the drug in the other 
group.  The study was originally designed to include a Step 3 (in which participants 
were to receive open-label daily oral TDF/FTC for up to 48 weeks; this step was to 
start no later than 8 weeks after the last injection), and after completion of Step 3, 
all participants were to be transitioned to local HIV prevention services.  However, 
due to meeting pre-specified stopping criteria for superiority of CAB LA to TDF/FTC, 
the blinded, randomized portion of HTPN 084 was stopped early, at which time, no 
participants had been transitioned to protocol-planned Step 3. 
For any participants with a positive pregnancy test during the study, confirmation of 
pregnancy at a subsequent visit at least 4 weeks later was required.  All pregnant 
participants with a confirmed positive pregnancy test (at least 4 weeks after the 
initial pregnancy test) were unblinded and followed on study every 12 
weeks.  Regardless of the randomization assignment or point in the study, all 
pregnant participants were to be placed on open-label TDF/FTC for the duration of 
the pregnancy.  No participant with a positive pregnancy test was to be 
administered CAB, CAB LA, or CAB LA placebo. 
Once a pregnancy outcome was reached, if the participant was not breastfeeding, 
she was allowed to resume taking study product and continue study 
visits/assessments according to the protocol’s schedule of events.  For any 
participant who delivered a child during the study and then elected to breastfeed, 
she was to stay on open-label TDF/FTC and was followed per the schedule of 
events.  Once the participant finished breastfeeding, she was allowed to resume 
study product and continue study visits/assessments according to the schedule of 
events.  Unblinded participants had the option to return to open-label study product 
in their original randomization arm (either CAB LA or oral TDF/FTC). 
The population included adult (age 18 to 45 years) cisgender women who were HIV-
negative and at risk for acquiring HIV infection.
Duration of Step 1 
(OLI Phase): 
-For 4 weeks (up to 5 weeks allowed for any delays in 
testing results)
Duration of Step 2 
(Injection Phase):
Duration of Step 3 
(Follow-up Phase):
-From End of Step 1 until the required number of 
endpoints (114) was reached, estimated to be 81 
weeks after enrolling the last participant, or until a 
stopping boundary was crossed.
-8 weeks after the last injection, for up to 48 weeks 
Hypothesis
Superiority: This study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CAB LA 
for PrEP in HIV-uninfected women.  The hypothesis Ho: HR = 1.0 versus Ha: HR  
1.0 using  = 0.05 was tested.

Efficacy analyses using the mITT Population include data from Steps 1 and 2 as well 
as from participants who discontinued study product altogether and moved to 
annual follow-up in Step 1 or 2 
Following the primary analysis, extended retrospective virologic testing was 
performed to better characterize the timing of HIV-1 infections. As a result, 1 of 
the 4 HIV-1 incident infections in participants receiving cabotegravir was 
determined to be a prevalent infection. The original hazard ratio corrected for

Injection Step 2 Efficacy Population with OBSP Censoring
Analysis Population: Injection (Step 2) Efficacy Population: The mITT 
Population who received at least 1 injection and were uninfected at the time of the 
first injection (excluding those who were inappropriately enrolled).
Analysis period: Follow-up time included primary analysis study time from the time 
of the first injection through the completion of the blinded injection phase of study 
follow-up.
OBSP Efficacy Analysis Censoring:
Censoring for the OBSP efficacy analysis excluded any time affected by delayed 
injections.  Participants were censored the first time an injection was delayed, which 
was defined as follows:
For STEP 2:
1. Last non-delayed injection:  The earliest of an injection whose subsequent 
injection was delayed for the first time (i.e. given >6 weeks after the Week 5 
injection or >10 weeks after any other injection) or the last injection before a 
termination or a permanent product discontinuation.
2. For participants with a delayed injection, follow-up time was censored at the last 
visit with HIV status determined up through 6 weeks after the Week 5 injection, if 
that was the last non-delayed injection, or 10 weeks after the last non-delayed 
injection for subsequent injections.
3. For participants with no delayed injections, analysis time was defined as for 
primary efficacy analysis.

2.5.5.3.  Clinical studies in special populations
According with a positive opinion (PIP nr P/0102/2022) the analysis of the combined PopPK model with 
the inclusion of both adolescent and adult PK data confirmed no impact of age on CAB PK parameters 
indicating a good precision of the final model (final111) PopPK model built without the adolescent data.
Successful external validations confirmed a good precision of the model to predict the exposures in 
adolescents after different dosing regimen (Q8W) without requiring PK data in adolescents at this 
regimen. Data from 8 adolescents were included in the model and these were found to be sufficient. 
This Key Element appears to be compliant.
Analysis of the combined PopPK model with the inclusion of both adolescent and adult PK data has

N/A
2.5.5.6.  Supportive studies
Not applicable. No data concerning efficacy could be retrieved from the supportive studies presented.
2.5.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy
The sought indication is: 
Apretude is indicated in combination with safer sex practices for pre-exposure prophylaxis to reduce 
the risk of sexually acquired HIV-1 infection in high-risk adults and adolescents, weighing at least 35 
kg (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1).
Two pivotal and supportive studies are included in this application. No pooled data could be obtained 
due to the different population included, namely different “HIV risk” and geographic regions involved. 
No efficacy data could be obtained from the supportive studies due to their design.
The Cabotegravir dose rationale was based on maintaining Cabotegravir dose concentrations 4 times 
greater that the in vitro protein-adjusted 90% inhibitory concentration (PA-IC90) value of 0.166 µg/mL 
(i.e., 0.664 µg/mL), a concentration range shown to have significant antiviral activity in vitro and in 
Phase IIa monotherapy studies used for the approval of the use of Cabotegravir in HIV-1 infected 
participants (in combination with rilpivirine).  
From the data presented the timing to achieve 4x PA-IC90 of 0.664 μg/mL was similar in population on 
CAB submitted to OLI and the ones in the DTI group. 
The Injection Phase of the dosing regimen used in the pivotal studies HPTN 083 and HPTN 084 is 
initiated by 2 injections (single 600 mg, 3 mL IM) administered 4 weeks apart, with subsequent 
Assessment report 
EMA/360205/2023 
Page 98/150
injections administered Q8W. This is the same dose used for HIV1 treatment in combination with 
rilpivirine. 
Study 208580 evaluated the use of the adult Q4W CAB regimen in HIV-infected adolescents (age 12 
years to <18 years and >=35 kg) and provided PK and safety data that were considered supportive of 
the proposed indication for the use of the adult CAB PrEP regimen in individuals weighing at least 35 
kg. The same dosing used for HIV1 treatment in adolescents.
The clinical studies design was adequate with both pivotal studies being robust, both randomized 2 
arm double blinded; 
-HTPN083 was a non-inferiority study including cisgender MSM and TGW in 43 centers (none in 
Europe); this multicentre Double Blind controlled study design allows a comparison of the study drug 
with the only alternative medicinal product (TDF/FTC) available in the claimed indication. The Applicant 
justifies the choice of a non-inferiority design by the fact that TDF/FTC has been shown to be highly 
effective in high-risk MSM populations so that it is sufficient to establish that CAB LA has similar 
effectiveness to TDF/FTC.
-HPTN084 was a superiority study that included cisgender women, all from SSA. This is a multicenter, 
double blind controlled study with a similar study design to that of HPTN 083. However, the study was 
designed as a superiority trial instead of a non-inferiority as expected for a drug compared to an active 
comparator with a proven efficacy. The Applicant justified this choice by the fact that trials of TDF/FTC 
in women in SSA have yielded mixed results, probably due to non-adherence, with some showing no 
efficacy and therefore a non-inferiority design was not advisable, and this is considered acceptable.  
According to the study protocols, participants who became pregnant were to be placed on open-label 
TDF/FTC and could resume unblinded study product only once pregnancy outcome was reached if not 
breastfeeding. This approach is in principle acceptable. However, due to the long-lasting effect of CAB, 
some women could have been exposed to the study drug at the initiation of pregnancy, therefore 
having all available information on pregnancies occurred during the study is of importance (see 
pharmacology and safety section).
For both pivotal trials CAB PrEP dosage regimen was daily oral CAB (30 mg tablets) for up to 5 weeks 
followed by single 3 mL injection of 600 mg CAB LA 4 weeks apart for the first 2 doses followed by 
Q8W thereafter.
The Applicant provided justifications on generalizability of the study results to the EU population by 
firstly highlighting the need for new interventions given the incidence rate of new HIV diagnoses in the 
European Region, which have not decreased sufficiently, despite the availability of effective HIV 
prevention tools (daily, oral TDF/FTC since 2016) and due in particular to adherence that wanes over 
time. This can partially be supported. Indeed, while over the last decade new HIV diagnoses in the EU 
population declined, incidence rates among some subpopulations (adolescents, adults >50 yoa) or 
specific geographical areas (Central and Eastern Europe) remained unchanged despite TasP and PrEP 
of HIV/AIDS. In addition, the Applicant argues that considerable data used for popPK model design and 
validation were obtained from participants in the ATLAS and FLAIR studies that were enrolled in the 
EU, and that popPK model has not shown an effect of race on CAB PK, thus supporting the conclusion 
that race is not a factor that influences safety outcomes.
In both studies the main inclusion criteria was to have an HIV negative test. The in- and exclusion 
criteria reflect a population above 18 years old, sexually active, that should benefit from PrEP, MSM 
and TGW (HTPN083) or born female (HTPN084) with an exclusion in both studies of AgHBs positive 
patients, which is acceptable taking into account the comparator used.
Overall, inclusion and exclusion criteria are considered appropriate reflecting a MSM and TGW HIV 
high-risk population and are in line with those used in iPrEx study supporting Truvada authorisation for 
Assessment report 
EMA/360205/2023 
Page 99/150
PrEP.  Key criterion for eligibility in pivotal studies were to be at substantial risk of HIV infection based 
on self-reported sexual activity and/or self-assessed risk scores; this is recognized.   
According to ECDC operational guidance (HIV Pre-exposure prophylaxis in the EU/EEA and the UK: 
implementation, standards and monitoring), populations in greatest need of effective PrEP may include 
people who inject drugs and physicians could consider off-label prescription of PrEP for these at-risk 
individuals. However, as for EMA reflection paper (EMA/171264/2012), the efficacy that is achieved by 
an oral PrEP against HIV acquisition during sexual encounters cannot predict efficacy transmission via 
contaminated needles and this could be probably applied also to parenteral administration (IM) PrEP. 
Moreover, apparently, none of the submitted studies included people who inject drugs (exclusion 
criteria in HPTN 083), making difficult to draw any conclusion on CAB LA PrEP B/R in this population.
In both studies the Primary efficacy endpoint was the number of documented HIV infections in Step 1 
and 2 of the trials. They match the objectives of the studies and are acceptable. 
The Study Medication Satisfaction Questionnaire (SMSQ) was used in HPTN 083 to evaluate 
participant-reported tolerability of and satisfaction with the study drugs. In HPTN 084 overall treatment 
satisfaction was assessed by asking participants about inconvenience and pain or discomfort 
experienced with receiving the oral and injectable study medication.
Study HPTN 083: The rate of participants who discontinued from randomized treatment or terminated 
from the study was similar between the two treatment groups, with the primary reason of 
discontinuation being participant unwilling or unable to comply with required study procedures (168 
[7%] and (178 [8%]) in CAB and TDF/FTC groups, respectively). 
The majority of participants in both treatment groups completed Step 1 and entered Step 2 (CAB: 
2117 participants [93%]; TDF/FTC: 2081 participants [91%]). At the time of the data cut of interim 
analysis (14-May-2020), the number of ongoing participants in Step 2 was similar in both groups 
(CAB: 1803 participants [79%]; TDF/FTC: 1786 participants [78%]).
Study HPTN 084: Among 3224 participants randomized, all entered in Step 1 of which 94% per arm 
entered in Step 2. At the time of the data cut at interim analysis (05 November 2020), a similar 
number of participants (91% in CAB and 89% in TDF/FTC arm) were ongoing in Step 2. Approximately 
5% in each arm discontinued from randomized treatment and the most frequent reason in CAB group 
was Participant request – unwilling or unable to comply with required study procedures.
Similar proportions of participants in both groups terminated from the study during the randomized 
treatment phase without prior study product discontinuation in both studies.
Baseline characteristics were well balanced between the two arms of the studies. HTPN 083 only 
including MSM and TGW and HTPN084 only including cis women from SSA origin.
In both clinical studies none of the subjects included was below 18 years of age.
Demographic characteristics are well balanced between groups in both studies, with the majority of 
subjects in HPTN 083 being <30 years old (with a median age of 26 years), MSM and with a SexPro 
Score ≤16 among US/South American participants. In HPTN 084 the majority of women were black, 
aged <35 years (with a median age of 25 years), with a BMI <30 kg/m2, and a screening modified 
VOICE risk score of ≥5. Just over half of participants had a main or primary partner.
As reported in literature SexPro scores ≤16 and VOICE risk score >5 both predict incident HIV 
infections with good sensitivity and specificity and are associated with high HIV incidence rates. This 
approach is generally used to improve self-assessment of HIV risk, to support linkage and uptake of 
HIV prevention strategies such as PrEP, as well as more for participant recruitment in HIV prevention 
studies. 
Assessment report 
EMA/360205/2023 
Page 100/150
Notably, individuals aged >55 years are under-represented in HPTN 083 and no subjects >45 years old 
were enrolled in HPTN 084, limiting strength of evidence of CAB effect in PrEP in older population 
groups. 
STI
In both studies a similar number of participants had STIs in the two treatment groups at baseline. In 
HPTN 083 almost half of participants were HbsAb+ compatible with HBV vaccination. A low percentage 
of subjects were also HBcAb+ suggesting previous HBV infection. HBV vaccination was provided to 
most participants in HPTN 084 at screening (78%).
Concomitant medications
In Study HPTN 083 a major use of antipyretic and anti-inflammatory drugs has been reported by 
participants randomized to the CAB group when compared to that receiving TDF/FTC. The greater use 
of antipyretic and anti-inflammatory drugs observed in CAB group from HPTN 083 study was due to the 
occurrence of AEs, in particular injection site reactions (ISRs), reported more frequently in CAB than in 
TDF/FTC group with injection site pain being the most common. Injection site reactions, including pain, 
are already reported in the table in 4.8 section of the SmPC and described under the paragraph 
“Description of selected adverse reactions”. 
In HPTN 084 concomitant medications were similar between the two study groups with a prevalence of 
medroxyprogesterone acetate (CAB 59% vs. TDF/FTC 58%) and paracetamol (CAB 47% vs. TDF/FTC 
44%).
Adherence
Adherence to oral pill count and injection visits was similar between the two groups, with 67% and 
66% of participants in the CAB and TDF/FTC groups, respectively, with pill counts corresponding to 90 
to 100% adherence in HPTN 083 and only <1% injection missed visits. Compared to HPTN 083, in 
HPTN 084 a slightly higher non-adherence to study treatments was observed (injection missed visits: 
CAB 8% and TDF/FTC 7%). 
According to EMA reflection paper (EMA/171264/2012), the duration of the study should be minimum 
two years to provide at least preliminary data on longer-term adherence and detection of usage 
fatigue. However, the blinded portion of the CAB pivotal trials was stopped at interim analysis based on 
DSMB review. Participants could remain on study in an open label extension. No new data on safety or 
efficacy is available. 
The primary efficacy endpoint in pivotal studies HPTN 083 and HPTN 084 is the rate of incident HIV 
infections in Steps 1 and 2. The rate of incident HIV infections in Step 2 was evaluated as a secondary 
endpoint.
HTPN083
Primary efficacy endpoint
A total of 13 incident infections were identified in the CAB group, for an incidence of 0.40/100 PY, and 
39 in the TDF/FTC group, for an incidence of 1.22/100 PY. Comparing the incidence across the groups 
yields of bias adjusted HR of 0.340 (adjusted 95% CI: 0.18 to 0.62), demonstrating a 66.0% reduction 
in incident HIV infections for participants randomized to receive CAB, relative to participants 
randomized to receive TDF/FTC, in this population of MSM and TGW.
Of the 13 incident HIV-1 infections reported for the CAB group, 3 occurred while the participant was 
receiving oral lead-in CAB, 5 occurred while the participant was receiving active CAB LA injections, and 
Assessment report 
EMA/360205/2023 
Page 101/150
5 occurred following prolonged periods when the participant was off CAB (oral CAB or CAB LA) due to 
product non-adherence or a study-related discontinuation. The Applicant specified that from a 
retrospective virologic testing, one participant in the CAB group, originally categorized as becoming 
positive while receiving active CAB LA injections, had been HIV-positive at Baseline, prior to receiving 
any study drug. Thus, overall, there were 12 (rather than 13) of those occurring in the CAB group, 4 
(rather than 5) incident infections that occurred while the participant was receiving active CAB LA 
injections.  
37 of 39 incident cases of seroconversion in the TDF/FTC group have been explained by low adherence 
based on plasma TFV and intraerythrocytic TFV-DP concentrations.
Upper bound of the CI was much lower than the NIM (1.23) in addition, as 1 (equal effect of both 
treatments) was not included in the CI there is evidence of superiority in terms of statistical 
significance (EMA guideline points-consider-switching-between-superiority-non-inferiority). The power 
to detect superiority is 47%.
Secondary efficacy analyses
Incident HIV-1 infections in Step 2 Only
The overall rate of HIV-1 acquisition in Step 2 of HPTN 083 was consistent with the overall observed 
treatment effect in Steps 1 and 2 of this study. In this analysis, the HR of 0.210 (95% CI: 0.10 to 
0.45) indicates a 79.0% reduction in the incidence of HIV-1 infections for the CAB group compared 
with the TDF/FTC group during Step 2 of the study, when the active drug received by participants was 
either IM injections of CAB LA every 2 months or oral TDF/FTC once daily. Thus, non-inferiority was 
shown.
Resistance mutations to study products (including but not limited to K65R, M184V/L, Q148R) among 
seroconverters
HIV genotyping results were obtained for 12 of the 15 CAB cases (1 failed analysis and 2 had no 
viremic visits). Three participants in the CAB group had integrase resistance mutations.  3 of the 
infected patients had a major INSTI mutation Q148R (2 subtype B and while on oral CAB, 1 subtype C 
while on LA CAB with no record of non-adherence).
None of the 3 participants with Baseline infections had resistance. Twelve participants with incident 
infection had resistance at the first viremic visit; 7 had NNRTI resistance only, 1 had NRTI resistance 
only, 1 had a single PI resistance mutation only, and 3 had NNRTI and NRTI resistance.
The 4 participants with NRTI resistance (including 3 who had multi-class resistance) included 3 with 
M184V/I and 1 with K65R. These mutations could have been selected by TDF/FTC.
HTPN084
Primary efficacy endpoint
In HPTN 084 at unblinding, 40 HIV incident infections were identified, 4 in the CAB group, for an 
incidence of 0.20 per 100 PY, and 36 in the TDF/FTC group, for an incidence of 1.85 per 100 PY.
Comparing the incidence between the groups yields an HR of 0.11 (95% CI 0.04 to 0.31, p-value 
<0.0001) (HR of 0.12 when bias-adjusted for early stopping at second interim analysis) demonstrating 
an 89% reduction in incident HIV-1 infections for participants randomized to receive CAB, relative to 
participants randomized to receive TDF/FTC, in this population of cisgender women.
Of the 4 incident HIV-1 infections reported for the CAB group in the primary analysis, 1 seroconversion 
was due to non-adherence; 1 seroconversion was detected when the participant was off CAB due to a 
Assessment report 
EMA/360205/2023 
Page 102/150
temporary study-related discontinuation (i.e., due to pregnancy); 2 seroconversions were detected 
during Step 2 while the participants were receiving CAB injections.
One of these 4 incident infections was determined to be a prevalent infection following the primary 
analysis. Therefore, in the CAB group, the incident rate was 0.15/100 PY and the TDF/FTC group was 
1.85/100 PY. Based on this, the bias adjusted HR (95% CI) is 0.10 (0.04, 0.27).
For the TDF/FTC group, seroconversion events were largely due to low adherence to the daily PrEP 
regimen based on PK findings. 
Secondary efficacy analyses
Incident HIV-1 infections in Step 2 Only
This secondary analysis, demonstrated that treatment with the CAB regimen was superior (p<0.0001) 
to treatment with the TDF/FTC regimen for the prevention of HIV-1 acquisition in Step 2 of the clinical 
study. In this analysis, the HR of 0.06 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.24) indicates a 94% reduction in the incidence 
of HIV-1 infections for the CAB group compared with the TDF/FTC group during Step 2 of the study 
(i.e., during the Blinded Injection Phase, when the active drug was either IM injections of CAB LA every 
2 months or oral TDF/FTC once daily).
Overall, the primary efficacy analyses from the two pivotal studies show consistent results. However, 
risk reduction resulted higher in HPTN 084 than in HPTN 083 (88% vs 66%, respectively). The 
evaluation of results along follow up show that, while incident infections in the TDF/FTC control arm 
increase comparably, CAB seems to protect to a lesser extent MSM/TGW than cisgender women. The 
Applicant provided the following possible explanations as reasons underlying lower efficacy in 
MSM/TGW from study HPTN 083 when compared to cisgender women from HPTN 084: a) HIV 
transmission is less effective through the vaginal mucosa in respect to anal sex (risk of HIV 
transmission estimated through unprotective receptive vaginal sex, insertive anal sex and receptive 
anal sex was estimated to be 0.08%, 0.62% and 1.4%, respectively); b) in HPTN 084, geometric mean 
CAB trough concentrations following CAB LA injections increased upon repeat administration from 1.48 
µg/mL at Week 9 to 2.68 µg/mL at Week 57, before the 8th injection, conversely to what observed in 
HPTN 083 study (ranging from 1.63 to 1.91 µg/mL); c) a Phase 1 study of healthy adults showed a 
median CAB tissue to plasma ratios of 0.14 (cervical tissue/plasma), 0.09 (rectal tissue/plasma), and 
0.16 (vaginal tissue/plasma) following single CAB LA 600 mg IM gluteal injections, suggesting CAB 
concentrations in cervicovaginal tissue likely to be higher than in rectal tissue. No new PK data were 
submitted regarding CAB concentrations in peripheral tissues and fluids. The potential justification 
provided by the Applicant is based on results of study 201767, a Phase 1, Multicompartmental 
Pharmacokinetic Study of Cabotegravir Long-acting in Healthy Adult Volunteers aimed to describe the 
PK profile of CAB LA in blood plasma, vaginal tissue (VT), cervical tissue (CT), cervicovaginal fluid 
(CVF), rectal tissue (RT), and rectal mucosal fluid (RF) following a single 600 mg intramuscular dose. 
As per table below, CAB was detected in different proportions in peripheral tissues and fluids: tissue 
concentrations were 1/6th (CT, VT) to 1/10th (RT) of plasma concentrations.

Table 15: Summary of CAB Tissue to plasma concentration ratios by visit and across all visits
A PK/efficacy relationship based on the CAB concentrations in peripheral tissues and fluids cannot be 
established, since the study was not powered to detect efficacy of CAB. In conclusion, all the 
explanations provided could be in principle considered reasonable. However, the clinical relevance of 
tissue or fluid concentrations with respect to the clinical targets is uncertain in the setting of HIV 
prevention and the number of infections in both studies is low not allowing for a clear conclusion on 
this issue. 
Resistance mutations to study products (including but not limited to K65R, M184V/L, Q148R) among 
seroconverters
HIV genotyping results were available for 3 of the 4 CAB participants. One of the 3 participants had an 
integrase mutation at the first viremic visit (L74I). None had a major INSTI mutation.   
Although resistance was present in both studies in the CAB arm, the resistance in the TDF/FTC arm 
was higher and in probable related to poor adherence. Noteworthy is the presence of a subject (HTPN 
083) that had HIV infection that was only confirmed afterwards (had HIV infection at screening), and 
the inability to, in some patients, have a resistance test due to low viremia.
In Study HTPN 083, 18 new HIV incident infections in the CAB arm were identified:
- in 2 of these cases the patients where adherent to CAB; 
.in one case, an infection seemed to occur possibly due to increased clearance of CAB with 
levels of CAB below 4-fold adjusted IC90, even with timely administrations, as already stated. The 
applicant could not find an explanation.
.in one case, the infection occurred despite adequate levels of CAB (>4x PA-IC90)
-in 3 cases a delay between the 8 week scheduled injections and 10 or more weeks was found with 
inadequate levels of CAB (<4x PA-IC90)
- in 2 cases infection occurred more than 6 months from the last CAB injection but were re-exposed to 
CAB in the setting of undetected HIV infection at the clinical site, to be found that the HIV-RNA test 
was positive
-11 cases occurred at least 6 months after the last administration
Assessment report 
EMA/360205/2023 
Page 104/150
   
In study HTPN 084 no-on injections cases where identified.
Clearly of concern are the 2 cases of infection while on-time injections. The data suggest that an HIV 
RNA based test should be performed prior to the administration of Cabotegravir at the initial 
administration and following injections complementing the Ag/Ab test (if negative). Of note, in the 
blinded phase of the HPTN 083 and HPTN 084 studies, HIV RNA testing was conducted at the Screening 
visit, and subsequently, only when acute HIV infection was suspected. In the open label extension, the 
testing algorithm was modified to include RNA testing for all participants at all visits in conjunction with 
an FDA-cleared HIV Rapid test and an HIV Immunoassay (Antigen/antibody test).  
The type of test used for HIV detection should be clearly mentioned in the SmPC (see Section 4.2.) and 
the diagnostic algorithm used for establishing HIV diagnosis was clarified by the Applicant.
The proposed dose schedule for evaluation in humans is based on maintaining CAB plasma 
concentrations well above the protein-adjusted 90% inhibitory concentration (PA-IC90) value of 0.166 
μg/mL, a concentration shown to have significant antiviral activity. In HPTN 083 full concentration-time 
profiles of the 4 participants who acquired HIV infection during the active Injection Phase of the study 
(Step 2) showed that CAB concentrations were >8 x PA-IC90 at first HIV positive visit in all 
participants. Even though the Applicant states that lower CAB concentrations were observed at 
preceding visits possibly reflecting an increased vulnerability to viral acquisition, this statement is not 
completely agreed with since CAB concentrations were always higher than the PA-IC90 value of 0.166 
µg/mL. The same applies to one of the two participants in HPTN 084. Plasma CAB concentrations were 
>8x PA-IC90 at all visits during the Injection Phase prior to the first HIV positive visit, which occurred 
at Week 73. The plasma CAB concentration at the first HIV positive visit was 0.416 µg/mL (1-4x PA-
IC90).
Given the high injection adherence and adequate CAB plasma concentrations, reasons for incident HIV 
infections and PrEP-associated drug resistance mutations remain largely unclear. The Applicant 
specified that in study HPTN 084 there were no on-injection breakthrough infections in any of the 
participants randomized to CAB LA during the blinded phase of the study, and that in study HPTN 083, 
4 incident HIV infections occurred during on-time CAB LA injections. Regarding CAB concentrations, 
they were >8x PA-IC90 at all 4 HIV-positive visits, however lower CAB concentrations at preceding 
visits may reflect increased vulnerability to viral acquisition. Only 1 participant is known to have 
plasma concentrations <0.65 µg/mL (<4x PA-IC90), which occurred 8 weeks prior to the HIV+ visit. It 
is argued that a clear exposure-response relationship for CAB in Study HPTN 083 participants cannot 
be found. Further the Applicant states that the potential role of other factors, such as viral burden, 
viral phenotype, and integrity of rectal mucosa, as well as risk behaviors that may have contributed to 
the development of incident HIV infections in HPTN 083 remains undefined. In the Applicant’s view no 
clear exposure-response relationship for CAB can be found and multifactorial aspects cannot be 
uncovered.
Based on extended half-life of CAB LA, individuals discontinuing the drug experience prolonged plasma 
cabotegravir exposure (approximately 12 months as reported in the SmPC). Thus, in case of HIV 
infection following CAB LA discontinuation INSTI-resistance mutation occurrence needs to be 
considered. To this regard it is noted that HPTN 083 and HPTN 084 studies both included open-label 
TDF/FTC in STEP 3 for 48 weeks after stopping study drug, and that in the SmPC Section 4.4 an 
alternative form of PrEP following discontinuation of cabotegravir injection for those individuals at 
continuing risk of HIV acquisition and initiated within 2 months of the final cabotegravir injection, is 
suggested. 
The Applicant considers that the duration of an alternative PrEP after CAB LA discontinuation depends 
on the individual risk of HIV acquisition, and this is reasonable as PrEP should be maintained as long as 
Assessment report 
EMA/360205/2023 
Page 105/150
risk behaviours are in place. Further, the Applicant argues that due to possible availability in the future 
of alternative long-acting forms of PrEP, the original test “alternative forms of PrEP” should be 
maintained. However, as the question posed focused on the minimum time that an at-risk subjects 
discontinuing CAB LA should be prescribed with an alternative form of PrEP, the Applicant’s response 
was not considered acceptable. Subsequently, the Applicant agreed to modify the original text to 
include “alternative not long-acting forms of PrEP”. In both HPTH 083 and 084 participants received 
post-CAB LA prophylaxis with an alternative PrEP and this information should be specified in Apretude’s 
SmPC. To protect subject from acquiring HIV while having waning CAB plasma levels, an alternative 
form of PrEP is to be used after stopping CAB LA injections and should in any case be based on 
medicinal products with non-LA characteristics. This is considered relevant to the prescriber, and even 
more in the next future in case other options with LA PK will be available. 
With regards to resistance at diagnosis almost all subjects in study HPTN 083 who had infection during 
oral lead-in phase showed INSTI resistance. Moreover, INSTI resistance was reported also in subjects 
with infection despite on-time CAB injections (3 out 6 subjects of which two had no viremic visit). 
ARV follow-up treatments for seroconversions are also included. Only two patients in each study 
received follow-up cART based on integrase inhibitors (bictegravir in study HPTN 083 and dolutegravir 
in study HPTN 084). The Applicant states that no further information is available regarding time to 
virological suppression. Unfortunately, this missing piece of information inevitably limits evaluation of 
future treatment success in subjects infected during CAB LA administration.
Subgroups analyses
In Study HPTN 083, the overall incidence rate of 0.94 incident infections per 100 person years in 
participants <50 kg is similar to the overall incidence rate of 0.8 incident infections per 100 person 
years in participants >= 50 kg, and that in HPTN 084 the overall incidence rate of 1.31 incident 
infections per 100 person-years in participants <50 kg is similar to the overall incidence rate of 1.0 
incident infections per 100 person-years in participants >= 50 kg. 
Findings for all subgroups, including region, were consistent with the overall treatment effect with a 
lower rate of incident HIV-1 infections observed for participants randomized to CAB group compared 
with participants randomized to TDF/FTC group.  The US region, representing the most person years in 
a stratum, shows this effect more than the other three regions.  This could possibly be due to 
adherence to TDF/FTC being less in the US than in other regions. The larger confidence interval around 
the outcome estimates is driven mainly by the smaller person-years in each of the subgroup 
categories; all point estimates for the hazard ratio favor CAB. NB that there was only one site from the 
African region in HPTN 083 that enrolled 65 participants.  
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Apretude injection in the paediatric population weighing at least 35 Kg and aged >12 to 18 years old in 
the prevention of HIV-1 infection. 
The Applicant is compliant with PIP approved final opinion.
Efficacy extrapolation from adult source population to the adolescent target population is agreed and is 
in line with guideline “Reflection paper on the use of extrapolation in the development of medicines for 
paediatrics (EMA/189724/2018)”. As no age-dependent PK variability is observed, in case of an 
Assessment report 
EMA/360205/2023 
Page 106/150
appropriate adherence, LA CAB PrEP is expected to provide similar protection rates in subjects aged 
between 12 and 17, as in adults.  
No efficacy outcomes are foreseen for the adolescent sub-studies of Study HPTN 084-01 and HPTN 
083-01. Nonetheless, data on seroconversions are available and none of the participants developed 
HIV infection.
Sub-study HPTN 083-01 
Sub-study HPTN 083-01 enrolled only 9 adolescents with age below 18 years (range 15-17 years) out 
of the 35 originally planned. All participants’ weight was >35 kg at Enrolment (range 63 – 167 kg) as 
per inclusion criteria and all were male at birth (6 MSM, 2 TGW, 1 ‘other’). No adolescents under 50 kg 
of weight were included. It is acknowledged that, due to the small sample size, no substantial 
conclusions can be made in terms of PK exposure in adolescents within sub-study HPTN 083-01. Such 
small number of participants, likely together with a lack of adherence to the treatment, led to a very 
high variability in the oral lead-in phase (CVb about 400%). However, the variability became moderate 
in the injection phase (CVb about 40%). Taking into account the above limitations, HPTN 083-01 data 
show that CAB mean concentration in the injection phase (week 33) for adolescents was about 2.0 
µg/mL, thus quite in line with the one registered in adults (1.78 µg/mL) for main study HPTN 083. The 
same is for the oral lead-in phase, where CAB mean concentration is 4.7 µg/mL in adolescents and 
4.29 µg/mL in adults. Mean Ctau from the second injection (week 9) onwards was confirmed to be 
above 8xPA-IC90 (preclinical benchmark suggesting efficacy for maintenance of HIV suppression in 
HIV infected subjects). 
Sub-study HPTN 084-01 
PK results of sub-study HPTN 084-01 confirm that age does not influence CAB PK, but some issues 
remain regarding the impact of lower weight on CAB exposure.
2.5.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy
Overall, it can be concluded that the efficacy of cabotegravir, in prevention of acquisition of HIV-1 
infection has been established.  Both pivotal studies had a significative number of subjects, one 
including MSM and TGW and the other cis women and the comparator used was TDF/FTC the actual 
mainstay of HIV PrEP approved in the EU.
A similar efficacy outcome is expected in adolescents based on a PK extrapolation. 
All concerns and issues raised along the procedure have been addressed by the applicant as explained 
in the discussion section and reflected in the SmPC.

In pivotal study HPTN 083 the median (range) exposure was 457 (1 to 1093) days for the CAB group 
and 471 (1 to 1131) days for the TDF/FTC group. The median time of exposure of the Oral Lead-In was 
similar in both treatment groups (CAB group: 29 [1 to 115] days and TDF/FDC group: 29 [1 to 485] 
days). In pivotal study HPTN 084 the median (range) exposure was 452.5 (CAB, 1 to 1072 days; 
TDF/FTC, 1 to 1018 days) days for both groups. Among participants with a confirmed pregnancy during 
the study, the median (range) exposure was 210 (1 to 703) days for the CAB group and 241 (30 to 
732) days for the TDF/FTC group. The median time of exposure of the Oral Lead-In was similar in both 
treatment groups (CAB group: 29 (1 to 334) days and TDF/FDC group: 29 (1 to 224) days).  
For supportive study ÉCLAIR, a total of 105 participants received at least one dose of CAB including a 
total of 272 injections of CAB LA in 94 of these participants (median exposure of 287 days). In 
supportive study HPTN 077, a total of 151 participants received at least one dose of CAB including a 
total of 682 injections in 134 participants. 
The overall exposure can be considered sufficient to establish a safety profile for the CAB PrEP for the 
proposed population and indication.

Drug related Adverse Events
In HPTN 083, the proportion of participants who experienced 1 or more drug-related AEs was greater 
in the CAB group (1874 [82%] participants) compared with the TDF/FTC group (1355 [59%] 
participants) primarily due to the difference in the proportion of participants who experienced 1 or 
more drug-related ISR AEs between the 2 groups.  The drug-related AE PTs reported in 5% 
participants were injection site pain (1697 [74%] participants), creatinine renal clearance decreased 
(671 [29%]), injection site nodule (263 [12%]), injection site induration (255 [11%]), injection site 
swelling (204 [9%]), and blood creatinine increased (166 [7%]) in the CAB group. In HPTN 084, the 
proportion of participants who experienced 1 or more drug-related AEs was greater in the CAB group 
(1098 [68%] participants) compared with the TDF/FTC group (1014 [63%] participants) primarily due 
to the difference in the proportion of participants who experienced 1 or more drug-related ISR AEs 
between the 2 groups.  The drug-related AE PTs reported in 10% participants were creatinine renal 
clearance decreased (692 [43%] participants), injection site pain (519 [32%]), amylase increased 
(252 [16%]), blood creatinine increased (213 [13%]), headache (190 [12%]), and blood phosphorous 
decreased (169 [10%]) in the CAB group.

Drug-related serious Adverse Events
In pivotal study HPTN 083, the proportion of participants with 1 or more study drug-related SAEs was 
comparable between the 2 groups. In the CAB group, 5 drug-related SAEs occurred in 4 (<1%) 
participants (PTs: 2 suicide attempts, 1 affective disorder, 1 seizure, and 1 immune 
thrombocytopenia).  In the TDF/FTC group, 4 drug-related SAEs occurred in 3 (<1%) participants 
(PTs: 1 suicide attempt, 1 ALT increased, 2 cardiac disorder). In study HPTN 084, a total of 5 OBSP 
drug-related SAEs occurred in 1 (<1%) CAB participant (1 PT: respiratory tract infection) and 3 (<1%) 
TDF/FTC participants (4 PTs: AST increased, ALT increased, hepatotoxicity, and seizure).
Assessment report 
EMA/360205/2023 
Page 114/150
Deaths
In study HPTN 083 ten deaths were reported during Steps 1 and 2 (4 in the CAB group; 6 in the 
TDF/FTC group). Of the 10 deaths, 1 participant in either treatment group experienced a fatal SAE with 
cardiovascular event; of which 1 (PT: cardiac disorder in the TDF/FTC group) was deemed drug related 
as assessed by the investigator. Regarding the CAB group, gunshot wound, cardiopulmonary failure 
possible methamphetamine overdose and homicide due to secondary traumatic bleeding are not 
related to CAB. Regarding asphyxia, the time-to-onset and the verbatim provided in the narrative, i.e., 
‘mechanical asphyxia’ is unlikely to be attributed to CAB. In study HPTN 084 three participants in the 
CAB group experienced AEs that resulted in a fatal outcome (two during Step 2 OBSP [PTs 
hypertensive heart disease and headache] and one during Step 2 Non-OBSP [PT cerebrovascular 
accident]).  None were considered by the investigator to be related to study drug, but the fatal SAEs 
hypertensive heart disease and cerebrovascular event are poorly documented. No deaths were 
reported during the supportive studies. 
Adverse Events of special interest

Injection site reactions: in HPTN 083, a higher proportion of participants experienced ISRs in the 
CAB group (82%) compared to the TDF/FTC group (35%). The ISRs reported in 10% participants 
in the CAB group, by PT, were injection site pain (81%), injection site nodule (12%), injection site 
induration (12%), and injection site swelling (10%). A total of 81% participants in the CAB group 
and 31% participants in the TDF/FTC group experienced a drug-related ISR. No participants in the 
TDF/FTC group experienced an ISR leading to study drug discontinuation whereas in the CAB 
group, a total of 2.5% (53/2117) discontinued drug due to ISR. In HPTN 084, a higher proportion 
of participants experienced ISRs in the CAB group (38%) compared to the TDF/FTC group (11%).  
Injection site pain was the only ISR reported in 10% participants in either group (34% CAB group 
vs 10% TDF/FTC group). A total of 38% participants in the CAB group and 11% participants in the 
TDF/FTC group experienced a drug-related ISR.  Injection site pain was the most frequently 
reported drug-related ISR in the CAB group (34%). Noteworthy, the proportion of participants with 
at least one drug-related ISR AE reported in HPTN 083 (81% in CAB group) more than double the 
proportion reported in HPTN 084 (38% in CAB group). In general, the incidence and intensity of 
ISRs decreased over the course of both pivotal studies. The Applicant provided a multifactorial 
reasoning to explain the difference of reported ISRs by gender at birth focusing on the following 
aspects: a) number of safety visits in the Step 2 injection phase (which included active capture of 
solicited ISR events) for HPTN083 (19 visits through week 147) and HPTN084 (4 visits through 
week 145); b) prevalence exposure of IM or SC contraceptives in HPTN084 (93.4% participants 
concomitant or prior use); c) ISR frequency by gender for the phase 3 CAB treatment studies [In 
ATLAS-2M, 87 females (65%) on Q8W dosing and 95 females (69%) on Q4W dosing reported ISRs 
compared to 305 males (80%) on Q8W dosing and 295 males (78%) on Q4W dosing. From the 
week 48 pooled ATLAS and FLAIR data, 126 females (81%) and 361 males (86%) reported ISRs. 
For the week 96 pooled ATLAS and ATLAS-2M, 201 female (95%)  and 719 male (>99%) 
participants reported ISRs] and; d) data post-marketing experience studies with CAB PrEP (CAB LA 
PrEP Cohort: Prospective post-marketing Cohort Study to Assess Effectiveness and Safety of, and 
Adherence and Resistance to Cabotegravir for Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis in the United States; out 
of 52 participants in the study with documented injections of CAB LA for PrEP as of 28 February 
2023, 2 ISRs were documented through ICD-10 codes; one ISR was in a male individual and the 
other had unspecified gender).

Hepatoxicity: the frequency of Hepatotoxicity AESIs was similar across the CAB and TDF/FTC 
groups in both pivotal studies for both pivotal trials. Overall, the frequency of Hepatotoxicity AESI 
(<1%) in the CAB group was similar compared with the CAB+RPV group in the CAB treatment 
pooled pivotal studies (<1%) (CAB Treatment pooled ATLAS/FLAIR safety analysis). When liver 
Assessment report 
EMA/360205/2023 
Page 115/150
related study product discontinuations were assessed by the HHAC, similar numbers of these 
events were assessed as probable or possible DILI in both groups. In HPTN 083, 14 cases in the 
CAB group were considered as probable (n=5) or possible DILI (n=9). These events are 
uncommon occurrences, mild in severity and generally reversible.  For Hepatotoxicity AESIs, no 
SAEs of DILI were reported on either group. In HPTN 084, 8 cases in the CAB group were 
considered as probable (n=1) or possible DILI (n=7).  

Hypersensitivity: in HPTN 083, the proportion of participants who experienced 1 or more potential 
hypersensitivity AEs and other potentially associated AEs (Hypersensitivity AESI) during Steps 1 
and 2 OBSP was similar between groups (2%); but slightly higher when compared with the 
CAB+RPV group in the CAB treatment pooled pivotal studies (<1%) (CAB treatment pooled 
ATLAS/FLAIR safety analysis). 4 participants in the CAB group experienced potential 
hypersensitivity AESIs Grade 3. The PT of hypersensitivity was the most common potential 
Hypersensitivity AESI in both groups (CAB:1%; TDF/FTC:<1%). In HPTN 084, the frequency of 
Hypersensitivity AESIs was low and similar between groups during Step 1 OBSP and Step 2 OBSP 
(<1%). The PT of hypersensitivity was the most frequently reported Hypersensitivity AESI in both 
groups.

Hyperglycemia and Diabetes: In both pivotal studies, there was no suggestion of worsening of 
glycaemic profile of participants receiving CAB in CAB PrEP studies.  Although there was increase in 
the proportion of participants reporting AEs of blood glucose increased for participants in the CAB 
group in both pivotal studies, other AEs associated with Hyperglycaemia AESI were reported with a 
similar frequency across both groups. The frequency of AEs of blood glucose increased in the CAB 
group was higher in study HPTN 084 (43%) compared to HPTN 083 (12%), but is should be 
acknowledged differences between study protocols. When the totality of laboratory abnormalities 
are also taken into consideration, there is no apparent trend of increased blood glucose levels with 
treatment with CAB. 

Rash: in both pivotal studies, the proportion of participants with 1 or more rash and other 
potentially associated AEs (Rash AESI) was similar between groups (4%). Of the Rash AESI PTs, 
PT rash was reported in the greatest proportion of participants in both groups (3% in HPTN 083 
and 2% in HPTN 084). For both pivotal studies, all other reported Rash AESI PTs occurred in <1% 
of participants in either group. In HPTN 083, drug-related (n=8), Grade 3 in intensity (n=2) 
Rash AESIs, study drug discontinuations (4 participants) and study drug interruptions 
(3 participants) were infrequent. In HPTN 084, no participants experienced Rash AESIs that were 
serious or that led to study drug discontinuation.

Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events: in both pivotal studies, the proportion of participants with 
Neuropsychiatric AESIs was similar across both groups.

Note: PTs are listed in the order of decreasing frequency in the CAB group.

Seizures and Seizure-like events: events of seizure and related terms were reported at a low and 
similar frequency (<1%) in both groups during both HPTN 083 and HPTN 084 studies. In CAB 
group of HPTN 083, 5 participants experienced AESIs Grade 3 and 4 participants had SAEs.  
There were 2 participants who experienced study drug-related AESIs and 3 participants who had 
AESIs leading to study drug discontinuation. Narratives were reviewed and most of the cases of 
seizures occurred in participants with concurrent or pre-existing risk factors, or alternative 
aetiologies for the events; there were no cases reported in association with CAB that provided 
convincing evidence to support a causal association. In HPTN 084, reports of Seizure AESIs were 
infrequent, with the same number of participants reporting any Seizure AESI in both groups (2 
[<1%] participants) in each group. Of the 2 participants in the CAB group with a Seizure AESI, 
both experienced a Grade 1 or 2 event, and no participants had a Grade 3 or higher Seizure AESI.  
Neither participant experienced an event that was serious, related to study drug, or led to study 
drug discontinuation.
 Weight gain: in both pivotal studies, the proportion of participants who experienced 1 or more AEs 
of weight gain and other potentially associated AEs (Weight Gain AESI) was low and comparable 
between groups (<1% participants in each group). In HPTN 083, there was a numerically higher 
number of AEs reported for the PT obesity in the CAB group (CAB: 13 participants; TDF/FTC: 8), 
although there were no Grade 3 Weight Gain AESIs, Weight Gain SAEs, Weight Gain AESIs related 
to study drug, or Weight Gain AESIs leading to study drug discontinuation. In HPTN 084, neither 
participant experienced an event that was serious, related to study drug, or led to withdrawal.

Rhabdomyolysis | Myalgia: In HPTN 083, rhabdomyolysis was reported infrequently throughout 
the CAB PrEP program.  None of the cases were considered by the investigator to be related to 
study drug. In HPTN 084, there were no reported events of rhabdomyolysis in either the CAB or 
TDF/FTC group. In HPTN 083, the proportion of participants who experienced 1 or more 
Rhabdomyolysis AESI PTs was comparable between groups.  The most common Rhabdomyolysis 
AESI PT was myalgia (CAB: 5% participants; TDF/FTC: 4%). The overall frequency of myalgia was 
similar between the CAB and TDF/FTC groups, however the number of participants with drug-
related AEs, as determined by the investigator, was higher in the CAB group. In HPTN 084, 
myalgia was the only Rhabdomyolysis AESI PT that was reported (CAB: 3% participants; 2% 
TDF/FTC).


Pancreatitis: SAEs of pancreatitis were reported during the CAB Treatment program. Based on a 
review of the medical history/risk factors and/or investigators’ opinion, the Applicant considers that 
there were compelling etiologies (e.g., gallstones) for most of these cases. In the CAB PrEP 
program, one participant experienced an AE of pancreatitis (in study HPTN 083).  An expanded 
analysis to look at additional AEs potentially suggestive of pancreatitis ('Pancreatitis Plus') has 
been conducted by the Applicant in both of the pivotal CAB PrEP studies. The available data from 
the CAB PrEP program, including data from the expanded analysis, does not provide evidence of a 
causal association with CAB.

Impact on creatinine: There were no reported pre-specified AESIs for the Impact on Creatinine 
AESI for CAB in both pivotal studies. However, there were reports of AE PTs (blood creatinine 
increased and creatinine renal clearance decreased) reported frequently in similar proportions in 
both groups in pivotal trials and supportive study HPTN 077. These observations were reviewed 
by the Applicant as part of a comprehensive expanded analysis. Taken together these results with 
the objective laboratory values for creatinine clearance and creatinine reported during CAB PrEP it 
is agreed that these findings do not suggest clinical relevant trends and a significant impact of CAB 
PrEP on renal function. This is supported by the findings from the CAB Treatment program that 
there is no clinically relevant effect of CAB on creatinine or creatinine clearance of HIV-infected 
participants.

Pyrexia: in HPTN 083, a higher proportion of participants experienced pyrexia events and events 
associated with pyrexia defined as Pyrexia Plus has been shown to occur more frequently in the 
CAB group compared to the TDF/FTC group whereas in HPTN 084 no differences were found 
among groups. Overall, pyrexia events occurred following IM injections and are known to occur 
following CAB injections in the Treatment (up to 8%) (CAB Treatment pooled ATLAS/FLAIR safety 
analysis).

The incidence and severity of clinical chemistry abnormalities is comparable between treatment 
groups. However, differences of Grade 1-2 liver function test abnormalities between HPTN 083 and 
HPTN 084 (more than twice the proportion among MSM and transgender women as compared to 
cisgender women) were found.
Liver Chemistry
In HPTN 083, a total of 78 participants (CAB: 40 [1.8%]; TDF/FTC: 38 [1.7%]) were reviewed by the 
HHAC and discontinued from study drug due to liver-related reasons.  A total of 14 participants in the 
CAB group were assigned to the DILI likelihood category of “probable” (n=5) or “possible” (n=9).  15 
participants receiving TDF/FTC were assessed by the HHAC as ‘probable’ DILI (n=2) or ‘possible’ DILI 
(n=13). In HPTN 084, a total of 33 participants (CAB: 15; TDF/FTC: 18) were reviewed by the HHAC 
and discontinued from study drug due to liver-related reasons. A total of 8 participants in the CAB 
group were assigned to the DILI likelihood category of “probable” (n=1) or “possible” (n=7).  7 
participants receiving TDF/FTC were assessed by the HHAC as “probable” DILI (n=2) or “possible” DILI 
(n=5).

Note: Includes events Grade 1 or higher at Baseline
Overall, no notable trends in creatinine abnormalities were identified with CAB PrEP and new safety 
concerns were raised regarding potential impact on renal function. Similar findings were found across 
arms from different pivotal studies.
Lipid Parameters and Fasting Glucose: shifts in lipid parameters and fasting glucose in both pivotal 
studies were similar between treatment groups and did not raise additional concerns.  
Clinical Hematology: No clinically relevant patterns nor differences were observed in clinical laboratory 
abnormalities, for hematology parameters between the CAB and TDF/FTC groups in both pivotal trials.  
2.5.8.3.  Safety in special populations
No prespecified safety analyses were done based on sex (at birth) in HPTN 083; for HPTN 084, 
prespecified safety analyses based on age (but not sex [at birth] or race) were performed. Of note, no 
Caucasians participated in HPTN 084 (cisgender women). 
For both pivotal trials, there was no difference in the trend of most common AEs when CAB PrEP was 
administered in a subgroup of participants <25 years of age when compared with the full study 
population. Moreover, the requested detailed analysis of the safety data (any event, SOC/PT, AE 
grade) per age subgroup (18-19 years, 20-21 years and 22 to <25 years of age), showed no overall 
discernible difference in the trend of most common AEs and ADRs reported with CAB PrEP compared 
with the total study population across both pivotal studies.

To support the CAB PrEP use in adolescents the Applicant conducted the study MOCHA/208580 that 
evaluated the use of CAB in HIV-infected adolescents (n=8) in addition to cART (Cohort 1C). Data from 
submission package revealed that at week 16, the most common AEs (occurring in ≥3 participants) 
were injection site pain, cough, and nasal congestion. All reported ISRs (62.5%) were Grade 1 or 2, 
predominantly comprising injection site pain. There were no SAEs or AEs leading to premature 
permanent discontinuation. Three participants had Grade 3 AEs (neutropenia and insomnia; n=1 each) 
or Grade 4 (n=1; blood creatine phosphokinase increased). There were no deaths or pregnancies, and 
no clinically important findings were noted with respect to laboratory assessments, ECGs, or vital 
signs. 
The Applicant provided an update safety report of Mocha study, though the Applicant recognized the 
limitations of the data given – i.e. data were produced for internal review purposes and were not in a 
submission-ready format. Following the completion of the first interim analysis of Cohort 1, an 
additional 22 participants were enrolled in Cohort 1C with a total of 29/30 completing Week 16. No 
participants discontinued due to AEs.  There were no SAEs considered related to CAB and no other 
SAEs or deaths among the CAB exposed participants in Cohort 1.  No pregnancies have been reported 
to the Applicant for Cohort 1 participants. 43.3% of participants reported AEs in the oral phase, of 
note, there were no events with a severity above Grade 2. Moreover, as noted previously, the MOCHA 
study is ongoing, Cohort 2 is fully enrolled and has reached its primary end point.  The only in-stream 
data to which the Applicant has current direct access were SAEs and pregnancies reported to DAIDS in 
an expedited manner. To date the Applicant was aware of 4 SAE reports (one of which was received 
during the reporting period of the interim CSR and involved a participant in Cohort 1R during Long-
term safety and washout pharmacokinetic follow-up. There is also one report of pregnancy (non-
serious, outcome unknown) for a Cohort 2 participant. Overall, new data provided do not raise any 
new safety concerns, or change the conclusions presented in the interim CSR.
No firm conclusions regarding the safety of CAB PrEP in patients co-infected with HBV and/or HCV can 
be drawn. No safety data are available in subjects with renal or hepatic impairment.
The safety of CAB PrEP during human pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been established. 
2.5.8.4.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions
CAB drug interactions have been evaluated in Phase I studies and clinically relevant data for the CAB 
PrEP program. Overall, CAB has a favourable drug interaction profile with few clinically relevant 
interactions that require dose modifications or contraindication. Therefore, it is not expected to 
experience clinically meaningful drug interactions, except for strong inducers of UGT1A1 (e.g. rifampin)

and chelation with antacids containing polyvalent cations (applicable to oral CAB only). Of note, no CAB 
dose adjustment is necessary when co-administered with hormonal contraceptives or gender-affirming 
hormone therapy, proton pump inhibitors, histamine-2 receptor antagonists, statins, HBV medications, 
HCV medications, and opioid dependence treatments.
2.5.8.5.  Discontinuation due to adverse events
In pivotal study HPTN 083, 135 (6%) participants in the CAB group and 91 (4%) participants in the 
TDF/FTC group experienced AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug. The higher proportion of 
participants in the CAB group was driven by ISRs. Of note, 24 participants (1%) discontinued study 
drug during the Step 1 period and never received IM CAB injections.

2.5.8.6.  Post marketing experience
The applicant stated that CAB PrEP received its first marketing approval in the US in December 
2021.  CAB Treatment has received marketing approval in several countries/regions (including US, EU, 
Canada and Australia). 
Cumulative post-marketing exposure to CAB PrEP available up to 30 June 2022 on the basis of the 
absolute number of vials of cabotegravir 200 mg/mL sold as CAB for PrEP, was 3362, equivalent to 280 
patient years of exposure. The Applicant has provided an update of all post-marketing data related to 
CAB PrEP/Apretude since the initial approval (20 December 2021) up to 6 March 2023. A total of 216 
cases were retrieved from the GSK safety database, of those 21 (10%) met the criteria for a SAE 
report. The safety profile reported is consistent with the established profile that has been seen in the 
clinical studies for both CAB PrEP and CAB+RPV for HIV Treatment and post-marketing experience with 
CAB+RPV. 
Based on post-marketing experience with CAB+RPV for HIV treatment, since the launch of CAB PrEP, 
validated signals have been assessed for hypersensitivity and suicide and self-injurious behaviour. As a 
result of these reviews, the Global Datasheets for CAB for HIV treatment and CAB for PrEP have been 
updated to reflect the new identified risks of hypersensitivity, including angioedema and urticaria, and 
suicide attempt and suicidal ideation. Hence and as requested, identified risks of hypersensitivity, 
including angioedema and urticaria, and suicide attempt and suicidal ideation were reflected in the 4.8 
section of the CAB PrEP SmPC.
Update clinical safety data from the on-going HPTN083 and HPTN084
The Applicant presented updated clinical safety data from the ongoing HPTN 083 and 084 studies, 
where the main findings are summarized and listed below. Of note, as the Applicant is not the Sponsor 
of the HPTN studies, and since the data cut-off of the CSRs, which were submitted as part of the MAA, 
only SAEs have been provided by the Sponsor. Unless otherwise specified, all initial SAEs hereby 
described were received in the GSK Global Safety Database from the respective CSR data cut-off dates 
of 14 May 2020 for HPTN 083, and 05 November 2020 for HPTN 084, up to 31 January 2023. Clinically 
relevant follow-up information for SAEs presented in the CSRs, and received up to 31 January 2023, 
were also presented where appropriate. The Sponsor has provided additional outputs from the open 
label extension (OLE) of the studies: cumulative pregnancies and pregnancy outcomes occurring in 
HPTN 084 and the HPTN 084 OLE (up to 21 February 2023), and adverse events leading to withdrawal 
for the HPTN 083 study only (from 14 May 2020 up to 22 November 2021). A similar listing has not 
been provided by the Sponsor for HPTN 084.
Overall, no new significant safety concerns were identified from the CAB PrEP updated safety data. 

Analysis of all new SAE
During the reporting period of this Safety Update report, there were 409 new SAEs from both 
studies (259 in participants taking CAB and 150 in participants taking TDF/FTC) in 363 
participants. This includes new SAEs, new serious AESI and those serious cases with a fatal 
outcome. SAEs were most frequently reported from the Infections and infestations SOC (36%), 
Psychiatric disorders SOC (12%) and Injury, poisoning and procedural complications SOC 
(12%). The frequency of SAEs mapping to other SOCs, not specified above, were <10% for 
either treatment. Individual SAEs across both treatments were mostly assessed as unrelated to 
study drug by the investigator.


Deaths
Since the respective data cut off dates for the CSRs for HPTN 083 and HPTN 084, 15 deaths 
have been reported (9 participants taking CAB and 6 taking TDF/FTC). None of the deaths were 
drug related by the investigator. 

New AEs leading to study discontinuation (only HPTN 083)
There were no AEs of ISRs leading to study drug discontinuation. There were 56 AEs leading to 
study drug discontinuation (30 in the CAB group, 26 in the TDF/FTC group). These occurred in 
49 participants (27 in the CAB group and 22 in the TDF/FTC group) with some participants 
experiencing more than one AE that led to study drug discontinuation. The most frequently 
reported AE was the PT ALT increased. During Step 2, the number of Grade 3 or 4 ALTs 
increased were 12 in the CAB group and 11 in the TDF/FTC group. All reports of ALT increased 
leading to discontinuation were assessed as unrelated to study drug by the investigators. 
Participants who experienced AEs related to study drug (per investigator assessment) which 
led to discontinuation of study drug were: 1) electrocardiogram QT prolonged (grade 3; onset 
date: 735 days); nausea (Grade 2; onset 712 days); hypersensitivity (grade 2; onset: 932 
days)
2.5.9.  Discussion on clinical safety
The safety profile of CAB PrEP is based on on-going Phase IIb/III CAB PrEP pivotal studies in cisgender 
men and transgender women 18 years who have sex with men (HTPN 083) and cisgender women 
aged 18-45 years (HTPN 084), who were HIV-negative and at high risk of acquiring HIV infection. 
When relevant, safety analysis also comprised data from supportive completed phase II studies 
(ÉCLAIR and HPTN 077) in men aged 18 to 65 years who were HIV-negative but were at low risk of 
acquiring HIV infection as well as data from the on-going MOCHA HIV treatment study in adolescents 
at least 12 years of age and weighing at least 35 kg, receiving CAB and in addition to cART (cohort 
1C).
For pivotal HPTN 083 and HPTN 084 studies, the safety population consisted of 4570 and 3224 
subjects, respectively, that were randomized to receive CAB and TDF/FTC placebo and TDF/FTC and 
CAB placebo. For both pivotal trials CAB PrEP dosage regimen was daily oral CAB (30 mg tablets) for 
up to 5 weeks followed by single 3 mL injection of 600 mg CAB LA 4 weeks apart for the first 2 doses 
followed by Q8W thereafter. The median duration of exposure was similar in both pivotal trials: 457 
days for the CAB group and 471 days for the TDF/FTC group in HPTN 083 and of 452.5 days for both 
groups in HPTN 084. The overall exposure can be considered acceptable to establish a safety profile 
for CAB PrEP. Of note, however, <1% of participants have completed Step 2 due to the early 
termination of the blinded phase of both trials.  In HPTN 083, few participants had reached Week 105 
by the time of the data cut off. Similarly, in HPTN 084, the number of participants reaching the later 
weeks of each pivotal study were limited and only few participants had available data at the Week 153 
visit. The Applicant clarified that at the time of data analysis, there were 475 participants exposed to 
CAB for at least 2 years in the HPTN 083 study, and 126 participants in the HPTN 084 study. The 
Applicant updated the clinical safety data from the on-going HPTN 083 and 084 pivotal studies (non-
blinded phase). Overall results did not lead to any changes to the important identified and potential 
risks for CAB PrEP. 
Updated data from the on-going MOCHA supportive study in HIV infected adolescents (an additional 
22 participants were enrolled in Cohort 1C with a total of 29/30 completing Week 16), revealed no new 
safety concerns, or changed the conclusions previously presented in the interim CSR. Nevertheless, 
neuropsychiatric events among adolescent population deserve further discussion as mentioned below. 
Assessment report 
EMA/360205/2023 
Page 127/150
In respect of the adolescent target population for this indication and from a PK/PD perspective, it is 
acknowledged that the applicant followed an extrapolation approach that was agreed within a recent 
PIP procedure for both efficacy and safety that is based on the outcomes of a modelling and simulation 
study. The PopPK model was already considered as validated and demonstrating no effect of age on 
PK. Also, it concluded that the same Q8W dosing regimen, shown to be efficacious in adults, leads to 
comparable exposures in adolescents and adults. Although, adolescents with weights <50kg would 
result in higher exposures, this was similarly observed in adults in the same weight band. Moreover, 
although exposures were higher in the <50 kg group, the Cmax and Ctau values were inside the limits 
observed in all clinical studies as consider as safe and efficacious. As such, from the PK perspective, 
the two populations behave in a similar way. The Applicant proposes to further characterise safety in 
adolescents through routine pharmacovigilance in the post-authorisation environment setting and 
through longer term safety data derived from ongoing studies in HIV treatment (e.g., MOCHA) and in 
PrEP (HPTN 084-01 OLE). Moreover, the Applicant proposes a PASS category 3 (CAB LA PrEP EU 
Cohort Study, to Assess Adherence and Effectiveness, and Monitor for Hepatotoxicity and Resistance) 
in the RMP – which is a 5-year long prospective EU cohort study of individuals weighing ≥35 kgs, 
initiating CAB LA PrEP, in real world clinical setting.
Although no PK/PD relationship was defined for CAB, the fact that the therapeutic regime is resulting in 
concentrations within the same margins as observed previously, gives added reassurance in the 
extrapolation process. As mentioned, new data from adolescent subjects were presented for MOCHA 
and HPTN 084-01 (that are still ongoing) and for HPTN 083-01 (considered completed, 9 
adolescents). 
Based on data from two open-label multicenter clinical trials in 64 HIV-uninfected at-risk adolescents 
(below age 18 years of age and body weight ≥35 kg at enrolment) receiving CAB PrEP, no new safety 
issues were identified in adolescents compared with the safety profile established in adults receiving 
Apretude for HIV-1 PrEP in HPTN 083 and HPTN 084. Nevertheless, special attention should be 
provided to INSTI class effect of neuropsychiatric AEs, especially suicidal ideation/attempt which may 
be of concern in this more vulnerable population. 
Adverse Events
The overall frequency and intensity of participants who reported at least 1 AE were similar in the CAB 
and TDF/FTC groups in Steps 1 and 2 OBSP for both pivotal studies. In HPTN 083, in the CAB group 
95% participants reported at least 1 AE and the maximum intensity was Grade 2 and Grade 3 in most 
participants (60% and 22%, respectively), whereas in the TDF/FTC, 94% participants had at least 1 AE 
and the maximum intensity was Grade 2 in 59% and Grade 3 in 21% of participants. In HPTN 084, 
96% participants reported at least 1 AE in the CAB group and the maximum intensity was Grade 2 and 
3 in most participants (76% and 14%, respectively) whereas in TDF/FTC group, 96% participants had 
at least 1 AE and the maximum intensity was Grade 2 in 75% and Grade 3 in 15% of participants.
Common Adverse Events
In HPTN 083, the most frequently reported individual AE (PTs) in participants in both groups were 
creatinine renal clearance decreased (CAB group: 69%; TDF/FTC group: 73%) and injection site pain 
(CAB group: 75%; TDF/FTC group: 30%), whereas in HPTN 084, was creatinine renal clearance 
decreased (CAB group: 72%; TDF/FTC group: 74%).
Overall, the proportion of participants who reported events considered drug-related by the investigator 
was higher in the CAB group compared with the TDF/FTC group due to ISRs. The difference in drug-
related AEs between the groups was lower in HPTN 084 compared to HPTN 083 (5% vs. 23%, 
respectively) because ISRs were reported less frequently in HPTN 084 compared to HPTN 083. 
Assessment report 
EMA/360205/2023 
Page 128/150
In HPTN 083, the drug-related AE PTs reported in 5% participants were injection site pain (1697 
[74%] participants), creatinine renal clearance decreased (671 [29%]), injection site nodule (263 
[12%]), injection site induration (255 [11%]), injection site swelling (204 [9%]), and blood creatinine 
increased (166 [7%]) in the CAB group and creatinine renal clearance decreased (723 [32%]), 
injection site pain (612 [27%]), blood creatinine increased (169 [7%]), nausea (125 [5%]), and 
diarrhoea (115 [5%]) in the TDF/FTC group. In HPTN 083, Grade 3 or higher drug-related AEs 
occurred in 6% (131) CAB participants and 4% (93) of TDF/FTC participants. The higher frequency of 
Grade 3 or higher drug-related AEs in the CAB group can mainly be attributed to ISRs. In HPTN 084, 
the drug-related AE PTs reported in 10% participants were creatinine renal clearance decreased (692 
[43%] participants), injection site pain (519 [32%]), amylase increased (252 [16%]), blood creatinine 
increased (213 [13%]), headache (190 [12%]), and blood phosphorous decreased (169 [10%]) in the 
CAB group and creatinine renal clearance decreased (699 [43%]), amylase increased (264 [16%]), 
blood creatinine increased (202 [13%]), headache (213 [13%]), and blood phosphorous decreased 
(190 [12%]) in the TDF/FTC group. In HPTN 084, Grade 3 or higher drug-related AEs occurred 5% 
(86) CAB participants and 6% (99) of TDF/FTC participants. 
Serious Adverse Events and Deaths
In HPTN 083, a total of 10 participants died (4 in the CAB group: gunshot wound, mechanical 
asphyxia, cardiopulmonary failure with possible methamphetamine as a possible risk factor and 
traumatic bleeding due to homicide). An additional death (stab wound in the TDF/FTC group) occurred 
in Step 3. In HPTN 084, there were 3 SAEs with fatal outcome reported (all in the CAB group; 
hypertensive heart disease, cerebrovascular accident, headache). An update safety report data 
revealed that since the respective data cut off dates for the CSRs for HPTN 083 and HPTN 084, 15 
deaths have been reported (9 participants taking CAB and 6 taking TDF/FTC). None of the deaths were 
drug related by the investigator. In the study HPTN 084, the additional headache fatal case, was 
discussed by the Applicant regarding the plausibility of relatedness for this AE. Based on the limited 
information provided it is agreed that a possible causal association with CAB exposure cannot be 
firmed. 
SAEs reported as drug-related occurred with a frequency of <1% in both groups in both pivotal 
studies. In study HPTN 083, the proportion of participants with 1 or more study drug-related SAEs 
was comparable between the 2 groups. In the CAB group, 5 drug-related SAEs occurred in 4 (<1%) 
participants (PTs: 2 suicide attempts, 1 affective disorder, 1 seizure, and 1 immune 
thrombocytopenia). In the TDF/FTC group, 4 drug-related SAEs occurred in 3 (<1%) participants (PTs: 
1 suicide attempt, 1 ALT increased, 2 cardiac disorder). Regarding the SAE of immune 
thrombocytopenia in the HPTN 083 study, the Applicant was requested to describe clear timeline 
regarding platelet count (until final recovery), CAB administration and treatment with steroids, but also 
regarding the presence of CAB during PK tail and relative platelet count after CAB discontinuation. The 
narrative of subject developing immune thrombocytopenia reports low platelet count at baseline, 
persistence of the event even after stopping CAB and concomitant medication (ketorolac). Thus, it is 
agreed that relatedness with CAB cannot be established. However, attention should be paid for any 
possible future case of thrombocytopenia with CAB exposure, considering also that thrombocytopenia 
was observed post-marketing with some other INSTI. 
In HPTN 084, two events (PTs) of suicide attempts and 1 SAE of PT affective disorder occurred in the 
CAB group. One suicide attempt occurred in the TDF/FTC group. One PT of seizure, considered serious 
and related occurred during the study in the CAB group and none in the TDF/FTC group. One event 
(PT) of immune thrombocytopenia considered drug-related occurred in the CAB group and 1 event (PT) 
of alanine aminotransferase increased considered drug related occurred in the TDF/FTC group. 
Assessment report 
EMA/360205/2023 
Page 129/150
In study HPTN 084, a total of 5 OBSP drug-related SAEs occurred in 1 (<1%) CAB participant (1 PT: 
respiratory tract infection) and 3 (<1%) TDF/FTC participants (4 PTs: AST increased, ALT increased, 
hepatotoxicity, and seizure).
In the study HPTN 077, the case of impaired sensation in left upper limb, considered related to CAB 
by the investigator but not by the Applicant, was discussed regarding the plausibility of relatedness for 
this AE. Based on provided narrative showing sensory disturbances in a subject between 20 and 30 
years of age during CAB exposure and with no definitive diagnosis, there are not enough elements to 
establish AE causality with CAB.
Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation
In HPTN 083, AEs leading to study drug discontinuation were low and higher in the CAB group (6%) 
compared to the TDF/FTC group (4%), which was mainly due to ISRs. In HPTN 084, AEs leading to 
discontinuation of study drug were low and similar in both groups (reported in 1% participants in each 
group). In HPTN 083, it is noteworthy that out of 135 participants in CAB group with at least one AE 
leading to discontinuation of study drug, 45 and 29 were due to ALT increased and to AST increased, 
respectively. These were the most frequent reported AE leading to discontinuation in HPTN 083. In 
HPTN 084, ALT was the most reported AE leading to discontinuation in CAB group (12 out 17 
participants that discontinued CAB). Moreover, in both pivotal trials ALT increased were seen as drug-
related Grade 3-4 events that led to discontinuation and therefore are clinically relevant. Transaminase 
increased are included in the SmPC (frequency common).  
Adverse Events of Special Interest

ISRs – As expected ISRs are considered an AE of special interest to CAB PrEP. Overall, CAB 
injections were generally well tolerated and the overall trend of ISR incidence and intensity 
decreased over time. ISRs were generally mild (Grade 1 to Grade 2), of short duration, and 
resulted in few study drug discontinuations. However, the difference of ISRs drug-related 
between pivotal studies (81% in CAB group of HPTN 083 vs 38% in CAB group of HPTN 084) 
was observed. The Applicant provided a multifactorial reasoning (e.g. number of safety visits in 
the Step 2 injection phase, prevalence exposure of IM or SC contraceptives in HPTN084) to 
explain the difference of reported ISRs by gender at birth which is acceptable. The Applicant 
also provided description of ISR event not resolved or resolved with sequelae for both HPTN 
083 and HPTN 084 studies that accounted for <0.2% in each study. Most cases were 
injection pain or injection swelling of Grade 1 and 2 in severity; in most of the cases 
cabotegravir injections were not discontinued. CAB injections must be administered to the 
ventrogluteal (the recommended) or dorsogluteal sites. The Applicant was asked to specify, if 
available, relative frequencies of administration modes and to describe ISR incidence by site. 
This issue is not further pursued given no data on frequencies or ISR rate by administration 
site (ventrogluteal vs dorsogluteal) are available as this variable was not foreseen by the 
protocol. 

Pyrexia - In HPTN 083, there was a higher frequency of pyrexia with CAB compared to those 
in the TDF/FTC group. Pyrexia has been shown to occur more frequently following IM injections 
with the majority of events occurring within 7 days of injection. In HPTN 084, the frequency 
of pyrexia was low and similar in both the CAB and TDF/FTC group in this study.  In HPTN 084, 
a temporal association has not been established between Pyrexia Plus events with ISRs or 
Pyrexia Plus events (influenza like illness, chills, feeling hot, body temperature increased and 
feeling of body temperature change) with injection visits. Pyrexia is known to occur following 
CAB injections in the Treatment program in HIV-infected participants.
Assessment report 
EMA/360205/2023 
Page 130/150
 Myalgia - The frequency of myalgia in the CAB PrEP pivotal studies was similar to the observed 
frequency in the CAB Treatment.  Overall, less than 2% participants across the groups of both 
pivotal studies experienced drug-related AE of myalgia. In HPTN 083, the majority of the 
drug-related events in the CAB group occurred on the same day or shortly after AEs of 
injection site pain. 

Hepatoxicity: The frequency of Hepatotoxicity AESIs in HPTN 083 and HPTN 084 was similar 
to what was observed in the CAB HIV Treatment studies (CAB Treatment pooled ATLAS/FLAIR 
safety analysis).  When liver related study product discontinuations were assessed by the 
HHAC, similar numbers of these events were assessed as probable or possible DILI in both 
groups. 

Hypersensitivity reactions: No cases of delayed or immediate type hypersensitivity causally 
associated with CAB were identified in the CAB PrEP program. The frequency of 
Hypersensitivity AESI was similar across the CAB and TDF/FTC groups in both pivotal studies. 
For Hypersensitivity AESI, no SAEs no AE led to discontinuation were reported. As requested, 
the Applicant has proposed to add a warning in 4.4. of CAB PrEP SmPC considering that HSR is 
a class-adverse reaction, which is endorsed. Hypersensitivity, urticaria and angioedema were 
tabled as an ADR in 4.8 section of the SmPC of CAB PrEP. In addition, the Applicant clarified 
that from the data available, the use of the oral lead in was not a predictor of the occurrence of 
HSR events occurring in Step 2 in either of the pivotal studies. Conversely, HSR AESI events 
occurring while on CAB LA in Step 2 were not contingent on the occurrence of an HSR event 
occurring in Step 1 OBSP.

Rash: Rash AESIs, typically of Grade 1 and Grade 2 intensity were observed. Overall, of the 
reported AEs analyzed as Rash AESIs in CAB PrEP were consistent with those considered as 
ADRs for CAB Treatment. Overall, the proportion of participants with 1 or more rash and other 
potentially associated AEs (Rash AESI) was similar between groups and pivotal studies (4%). 
Unlike HPTN 084, study drug discontinuations due to Rash and drug interruptions occurred in 
HPTN 083, but these were infrequent cases. 

Hyperglycemia and Diabetes: In both pivotal CAB PrEP studies, the AE of blood glucose 
increased was reported in a higher proportion of participants in the CAB group than in the 
TDF/FTC group; however, corresponding lab values do not suggest a trend for hyperglycemia.  
Furthermore, AE reporting of other relevant terms do not suggest a trend for hyperglycaemia 
or diabetes. 
 Weight gain: In both pivotal trials the proportion of participants who experienced 1 or more 
AEs of weight gain and other potentially associated AEs (Weight Gain AESI) was low and 
comparable between groups (<1% participants in each group). Weight gain is tabled in 4.8 of 
CAB PrEP SmPC with an ADR frequency of uncommon. 

Neuropsychiatric events: The Applicant presented a comprehensive review of neuropsychiatric 
AESI. It is agreed that based on the overall similarity of frequency of SAEs, study drug 
discontinuations and study drug-related cases between the CAB and TDF/FTC groups in both 
pivotal studies, CAB is considered to have in general a tolerable neuropsychiatric safety profile 
when used in these study populations for PrEP. The Applicant acknowledged the request 
regarding the inclusion of ‘suicide attempt’ and ‘suicidal ideation’, to the proposed CAB PrEP 
SmPC. 
The Applicant also agreed that the reason to exclude ‘Anxiety AESI’ for the CAB PrEP program 
based on the fact that ‘the time to onset for Anxiety AESI did not suggest a compelling 
temporal relationship with CAB administration’ was disputable. Therefore, the Applicant 
included ‘Anxiety’ in 4.8 of the SmPC as it is tabled for CAB treatment. Moreover, the Applicant 
Assessment report 
EMA/360205/2023 
Page 131/150
acknowledged the rationale for requesting the inclusion of somnolence in the section 4.8 of the 
SmPC. Consequently, corresponding updates have been made to Section 4.7 ‘Effects on ability 
to drive and use machines’ of the SmPC, with inclusion of somnolence, dizziness and fatigue as 
ADRs observed with CAB PrEP to this section.
From the pivotal studies HPTN 083 and 084 and the supportive studies for participants who 
developed neuropsychiatric AEs, the Applicant reviewed the time to onset of these AEs and the 
time to onset since the last CAB LA injection. CAB LA reaches T-max at 7 days. The time to 
onset since the start of CAB and since CAB LA is variable, and a temporal relationship was not 
observed at the time of peak plasma CAB concentrations and the occurrence of the 
Neuropsychiatric AEs observed. 
The applicant has provided a Table of all psychiatric disorder SOCs stratified by age groups (< 
and ≥ 25 years of age). Overall, in HPTN 083, in those <25 years of age, the majority of AEs 
from the psychiatric disorders SOC were Grade 1-2, and a higher proportion occurred in age 
group 22-24 years of age (which was also observed in the TDF/FTC arm). In HPTN 084, there 
were considerably less participants reporting AEs from the psychiatric disorders SOC. Even 
though, in those <25 years of age the majority of AEs from the psychiatric disorders SOC were 
Grade 1-2 and a higher proportion of these occurred in age group 22-24 years of age. This was 
also observed in the TDF/FTC arm. Nevertheless, with new data on adolescents exposed to CAB 
[MOCHA and HPTN 084-01 (that are still ongoing) and for HPTN 083-01 (considered 
completed, 9 adolescents)], the Applicant was requested to discuss the rate of some 
psychiatric AEs (in particular, suicidal ideation/attempt) with respect to adult subjects. Overall, 
no new safety issues were identified in adolescents compared with the safety profile 
established in adults receiving Apretude for HIV-1 PrEP in HPTN 083 and HPTN 084.
For neuropsychiatric events of special interest, the Applicant provided an additional analysis 
concerning participants’ body weight classes: <50 kg and > 50 Kg. In HPTN 083-01, none out 
of the 9 participants that experienced neuropsychiatric AESIs had a body weight <50 kg 
whereas in HPTN 084-01, none of the 15 participants with body weight <50 kg experienced 
any of these events. The Applicant presented the narratives describing SAEs of suicidal ideation 
and suicide attempt in the adolescent sub-studies. The causal assessment performed by the 
Applicant is agreed. Although it is acknowledged that a potential contribution of CAB cannot be 
completely excluded in the narratives of the cases provided, the events were reported as 
resolved, and CAB was not discontinued in all these cases. Based on the limited sample size as 
well as other limitations, the existent frequency proposed in the section of 4.8 of the SmPC 
should be maintained and no differences at this stage should be defined for adolescents. 
However, the adolescent population at-risk for HIV infection is a particular vulnerable sub-set 
with elevated background rate of neuropsychiatric events (and in particular, young LGBT are at 
particular risk for suicidal ideation and suicide attempt) (Pettifor et al, 2018; Shanaube K et al, 
2022; D'Augelli AR et al, 2001; Donenberg GR et al, 2001; Marshal MP et al , 2011). 
Therefore, although clinical studies did not show an increased incidence of psychiatric illness in 
adolescents in respect to adult subjects, particularly in case of pre-existing of psychiatric 
illness, a warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC was included to invite the prescribing physician to 
accurately counsel the adolescents before the prescription and during the treatment. 
Creatinine renal clearance decreased PT and blood creatinine increased PT were reported 
frequently in similar proportions in both groups in HPTN 083 and HPTN 084.  However, the 
objective laboratory values for creatinine clearance and creatinine reported during these 
studies do not reveal clinically relevant trends. This conclusion is supported by the findings 
from the CAB Treatment program that there is no clinically relevant effect of CAB on creatinine 
or creatinine clearance of HIV-infected participants.

EMA/360205/2023 
Page 132/150
Laboratory Assessments
The incidence and severity of clinical chemistry abnormalities is comparable between treatment 
groups. However, differences of Grade 1-2 liver function test abnormalities between HPTN 083 and 
HPTN 084 (more than twice the proportion among MSM and transgender women as compared to 
cisgender women) were found. The applicant presented a possible justification to explain the 
differences concerning the Grade 1-2 maximum post-baseline LFT abnormalities which might be 
related to the differences in the respective study populations at baseline, rather than any differential 
response to CAB during the studies. The Applicant reviewed the participants’ medical histories in 
pivotal studies at baseline which showed that 303 participants in HPTN 083 versus 86 participants in 
HPTN 084 had a known medical history of elevated liver chemistries (ALT, AST, ALP or bilirubin) prior 
to starting CAB. Once on study, there were no clinically significant differences between the studies in 
the median change from baseline for any LFT parameters in the CAB groups at approximately 1 year.
The Applicant acknowledged that bilirubin is considered an ADR in the SmPC for CAB PrEP and section  
4.8 of the SmPC was changed accordingly. In what concerns to lipase elevations, the analysis provided 
by the Applicant is endorsed. The frequencies of the reported events of increased lipase across both 
study arms and between trials in the CAB PrEP pivotal studies were similar. All events were non-
serious, the majority were Grade 1 to 3 in severity, and resolved without interruption or 
discontinuation of study drug. Moreover, it is acknowledged that lipase elevations are common in 
people living with HIV and that increased lipase is a recognized ADR with rilpivirine. 
Regarding ‘Transaminase increased’ it was proposed as an ADR for inclusion in Section 4.8 of the CAB 
PrEP SmPC under the Hepatobiliary Disorders SOC at the time of submission of the MAA, this was 
amended for inclusion under the Investigations SOC. This ADR has been proposed at a frequency of 
‘very common’ based on reporting rates in the CAB PrEP clinical trial programme from the pivotal trials 
HPTN 083 and HPTN 084 and supportive studies ÉCLAIR and HPTN 077. 
In general, it is envisaged that the Applicant would like to compare CAB PrEP to TDF/FTC for PrEP 
label, including for hepatic monitoring. However, currently, there is a major difference that needs to be 
considered. Unlike TDF/FTC, hepatoxicity is considered an important identified risk (safety concerns) 
for both CAB treatment and CAB PrEP. Given the data available, the Applicant changed the wording in 
section 4.4 of the SmPC to recommend clinical and laboratory monitoring and to discontinue Apretude 
in case of confirmed hepatoxicity. This will better inform prescribers about hepatic monitoring in 
subjects taking PrEP which is of relevance, since the applicability of hepatic monitoring might differ 
between people living with HIV and in subjects taking PrEP.
Special Populations
No specific analysis of CAB PrEP tolerability in participants with hepatic or renal impairment was 
performed given the enrolment criteria of the HPTN 083 and HPTN 084 trials. Dose adjustments 
were based in Phase I data and are reflected in the SmPC. Moreover, no firm conclusions regarding the 
safety of CAB PrEP in patients co-infected with HBV and/or HCV can be drawn. This has also been 
adequately reflected in the proposed SmPC.
The observed safety data reported for adolescent participants within MOCHA did not identify any new 
safety concerns relative to adult data and no new safety signals were identified based on the data 
provided. The data from the popPK model and the data retrieved MOCHA do not suggest a different 
overall safety profile for CAB in adolescents (>=35 kg) relative to adults with HIV infection. In 
alignment and in addition to MOCHA safety results presented in the SmPC, the Applicant proposed to 
add information concerning HPTN 083-01 and HPTN 084-01 study results in the section 4.8 of the 
Assessment report 
EMA/360205/2023 
Page 133/150
SmPC, which is agreed. Overall, no new safety issues were identified in adolescents compared with the 
safety profile established in adults receiving Apretude for HIV-1 PrEP in HPTN 083 and HPTN 084. 
The safety of CAB PrEP during human pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been established. Use in 
pregnancy is stated as missing information. Following the same rationale, the Applicant added ‘use in 
breastfeeding’ as missing information in the safety concerns.
Considering pregnancy, the Applicant provided a single table with overall 358 confirmed CAB-exposed 
pregnancies and their outcomes (if available) from the study HPTN 084 (i) and its open-label extension 
phase (ii) that after amendments permitted CAB administration during pregnancy. Moreover, the data 
from Antiviral Pregnancy registry (iii) on 10 CAB exposure pregnancies in HIV-infected women were 
provided, with additional two pregnancies reported to EPPICC database, iv) the cumulative pregnancy 
data from the CAB+RPV Phase 2/3/3b trials for HIV-1 treatment were presented: 43 confirmed 
pregnancies have been reported with no reports of congenital anomalies or adverse outcomes reported 
from those pregnancies that have reached full term.
From the presented HPTN 084 + OLE data, observed rates of Stillbirth/Intrauterine Foetal Demise (>= 
20 weeks) and of Spontaneous Abortion (<20 weeks) were respectively 1.6-4.3% and 12.9-15.2% in 
CAB-exposed pregnancies. Although rates may reflect the trial setting, a difference is noted in respect 
to TDF/FTC only Arm (0.0% and 2.4%, respectively). Further, 3 cases of congenital anomalies in the 
women exposed to CAB PrEP were reported (1 CAB blinded Arm and 2 OLE). While the narratives for 2 
of them were initially provided (one with multiple congenital anomalies and omphalocele and other 
SGA with hypospadias), the Applicant was requested to provide as well data on missing case and to 
discuss on the uncertainties of INSTI exposure on foetal outcomes. The Applicant stated that 3 cases of 
congenital abnormalities were reported from participants exposed to CAB on the HPTN 084/OLE study 
– two cases were previously presented and a recent case of polydactyly which was later described. 
Regarding the missing congenital anomaly case previously identified, the Applicant was informed by 
the HPTN 084 Sponsor, that a duplicate report was included in the number of congenital anomalies 
presented. While 3 cases of congenital anomalies occurring in participants receiving CAB were 
presented in the tabulations, there were only 2 congenital anomalies (one congenital anomaly was 
reported twice in error, once for the mother and once for the neonate). Regarding uncertainties of 
INSTI exposure on foetal outcomes, the Applicant summarized cumulative data from the following 
studies a) Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (DTG) (Data through January 2023), b) Eswatini 
Surveillance Study (Sept 2021-Sept 2022 update) and c) Tsepamo study. None of these databases 
confirmed or refuted the neural tube development (NTD) signal. Additionally, the Applicant stated that 
reviewed the available data from the APR, GSK’s Safety database, and the literature during the period, 
and has not identified other concerns relating to the use of DTG at conception or during pregnancy. 
The Applicant stated that no safety findings have been identified from the limited pregnancy outcomes 
data in humans and from pre-clinical reproductive toxicity studies at therapeutic doses. According to 
Applicant, there are currently no safety findings or efficacy concerns which justify making 
contraception a condition of use in the real-world PrEP population. It is anticipated that participants will 
be effectively counselled on the use of contraception as part of the benefit/risk discussions between 
HCP/prescriber and CAB PrEP user. Currently CAB PrEP is not recommended during pregnancy unless 
the expected benefit justifies the potential risk for the foetus, as stated in the SmPC. 
Considering the new data on a relevant number of CAB-exposed pregnancies provided with the 
responses, the Applicant was requested to clarify how many of these have actually received CAB 
injections during pregnancy, duration of exposure and maternal and foetal outcomes. The Applicant 
presented a summary of CAB-exposed pregnancies from HPTN 084 and OLE. In total (data lock point 
23rd May 2023), there were 314 confirmed pregnancies on CAB, 218 where the participant received 
Assessment report 
EMA/360205/2023 
Page 134/150
CAB LA during their pregnancy and 96 where the participant had received CAB LA within a year of the 
estimated pregnancy start date but not during their pregnancy. 
In light of the prolonged release characteristics of CAB PrEP, HCP should discuss the benefit/risk of 
CAB PrEP with women of childbearing potential. As requested, the Applicant added the following 
statements to the SmPC/package leaflet: a) to Section 4.4. Long-acting properties of Apretude 
injections: “Healthcare providers should discuss the benefit-risk of using Apretude with individuals of 
childbearing potential or during pregnancy (see section 4.6).”; b) to section 4.6: Women of 
childbearing potential: Women of childbearing potential should be counselled about prolonged release 
characteristics of Apretude injection. If a woman plans a pregnancy, the benefits and the risks of 
starting/continuing pre-exposure prophylaxis with cabotegravir should be discussed (see section 4.4).” 
The package leaflet (PL) is amended accordingly. 
Medication Errors
Medication errors occurred in both pivotal trials, being more pronounced in HPTN 084. The Applicant 
was requested to characterize medication errors in both trials. In HPTN 084, medication errors 
occurred in 73 participants. Of these, 56 participants were traced to a single site due to a systematic 
error in the volume of CAB LA/placebo dispensed (these participants received 80% of the protocol-
prescribed dose). For these 56 participants, the occurrences of underdosing ranged from a single 
episode up to 4 episodes per participant. There were no events of HIV-seroconversion or lack of 
efficacy reported at the time of the HPTN 084 submission for those participants who experienced 
underdosing at this site. Of the 17 remaining participants who experienced medication errors in HPTN 
084, 5 participants were on CAB LA and 12 participants were on the TDF/FTC arm. No AEs indicative of 
HIV seroconversions and or lack of efficacy were reported by any participant who experienced these 
medication errors. The Applicant agreed to review medication errors as part of ongoing routine 
pharmacovigilance and will present interval updates in future PSUR/PBRERs. Nevertheless, even 
though CAB PrEP exposure in real-world setting is low, there were medication errors reported to 
spontaneous reporting system, albeit no cases of seroconversion or resistance were reported as a 
consequence of these reported medication errors. Additionally, from the existent PrEP post-marketing 
data other situations/cases classified as ‘off-label use’ by the Applicant were reported, e.g. HCP 
intentionally injecting the individual at another injection site, individuals were self-injecting CAB PrEP 
into their arm, CAB PrEP dosing at unapproved intervals or outside of the target window, etc. Also, in 
what concerns to adherence, cases were reported where individuals missed their injection appointment 
in routine clinical practice. All in all, - “Medication errors, including treatment non-compliance” were 
considered as an important potential risk in the safety concerns of RMP for CAB PrEP.
Post-marketing experience
The Applicant has provided an update of all post-marketing data related to CAB PrEP/Apretude since 
the initial approval (20 December 2021) up to 6 March 2023. A total of 216 cases were retrieved from 
the GSK safety database, of those 21 (10%) met the criteria for a SAE report. The safety profile 
reported is consistent with the established profile that has been seen in the clinical studies for both 
CAB PrEP. Identified risks of hypersensitivity, including angioedema and urticaria, and suicide attempt 
and suicidal ideation were reflected in the 4.8 section of the SmPC.
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have 
been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

2.5.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety
The available data from Phase II and Phase IIb/III CAB PrEP, as well as supportive data from the Study 
MOCHA HIV treatment study in adolescents at least 12 years of age and weighing at least 35 kg, 
suggest that CAB PrEP is generally well tolerated in both adults and adolescents. This was overall 
reassured by the updated clinical safety data from the on-going HPTN083 and HPTN084 (non-blinded 
phase), updated MOCHA safety database as well as available post-marketing experience. 
CAB PrEP was well-tolerated with a safety profile comparable to the active comparator daily oral 
TDF/FTC in the pivotal studies, excluding the incidence of ISRs, which occurred more frequently in CAB 
participants.  Overall, no clinically significant new safety issues have been identified in participants for 
CAB PrEP from the pivotal studies HPTN 083 and HPTN 084 relative to the findings from approved 
CAB treatment.

2.6.4.  Conclusion
The CHMP considers that the risk management plan version 1.0 is acceptable.
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance
2.7.1.  Pharmacovigilance system
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC.
2.7.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.
Based on the new indication of pre-exposure prophylaxis, the PRAC is of the opinion that a separate 
entry in the EURD list for Apretude is needed, as it cannot follow the already existing entry for 
cabotegravir. The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal 
product are set out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request the 
alignment of the new PSUR cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 18.03.2020. The 
new EURD list entry will therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points.

2.8.2.  Labelling exemptions
A request to omit certain particulars from the labelling as per Art.63.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC has 
been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group for the following 
reasons:
 On the basis of article 63.3 of Dir 2001/83 (use by a HCP only) the applicant claimed that the very 
limited space of the vial label does not allow the printing of the long pharmaceutical form in a 
legible way.
After thorough assessment the QRD group granted an exemption to omit the pharmaceutical form from 
the vial label, provided that it appears on the outer package and that it will be used by HCPs only.
Moreover, the applicant’s request to omit the statement on lactose from the bottle label of the film-
coated tablets was not accepted. The QRD group considered that there is enough space to add 
“contains lactose” on the EN label, and even more on the trilingual version submitted. The particulars 
to be omitted as per the QRD Group decision described above will, however, be included in the 
Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website and translated in all languages but will appear in 
grey-shaded to show that they will not be included on the printed materials. 
2.8.3.  Additional monitoring
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Apretude (cabotegravir) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context
3.1.1.  Disease or condition
The therapeutic indication for this application after CHMP discussion and applicant’s agreement is: 
Apretude is indicated in combination with safer sex practices for pre-exposure prophylaxis to reduce 
the risk of sexually acquired HIV-1 infection in high-risk adults and adolescents, weighing at least 35 
kg (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1).
The HIV pandemic remains a public health emergency with an estimated annual 1.5 million incident 
infections worldwide in 2020 [UNAIDS, 2021a]. Although the annual number of infections has been 
decreasing on a global scale with a 30% decline since 2010, new infections continue to occur despite 
advances in the development of ART for HIV treatment and data demonstrating that individuals on 
stable ART with undetectable HIV-1 viral load do not transmit virus to uninfected partners [Cohen, 
2016; UNAIDS, 2021b]. Of the 37 377 new HIV diagnoses in US made in 2018, 7734 diagnoses (21%) 
occurred in adolescents and young adults aged 12 to 24 years; of these, 1707 diagnoses (22%) 
occurred in adolescents aged 13 to 19 years (JAMA Pediatrics May 11, 2020).
Assessment report 
EMA/360205/2023

HIV can be transmitted via the exchange of a variety of body fluids from infected people, such as 
blood, breast milk, semen and vaginal secretions. HIV can also be transmitted from a mother to her 
child during pregnancy, delivery and breastfeeding. 
The intended benefit of PrEP is the prevention of HIV infection.
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need
PrEP is a key component of the overall strategy to reduce the number of new HIV infections worldwide, 
not being available in all countries.
The current standard of care for HIV PrEP in the EU includes the tenofovir-based, fixed dose 
antiretroviral combination regimen, TDF/FTC, to be orally administered daily.
However, the use of daily oral tenofovir-based PrEP regimens for PrEP has limitations. Oral PrEP 
efficacy requires adherence to daily dosing regimen.
Clinical trials have demonstrated that oral PrEP efficacy is strongly correlated with adherence in key 
population groups including:
 MSM and TGW: Of the 22 HIV infections in the DISCOVER study, 5 were likely infected at study 
entry; excluding these 5 participants, 15 out of 17 (88%) had low (i.e., taking <2 doses/week) or 
undetectable tenofovir diphosphate concentrations in dried blood spots on the day of HIV diagnosis 
[Mayer, 2020]. In the iPrEX study, low drug exposure was associated with the majority of incident 
HIV infections; of the 34 participants with incident HIV infection in the TDF/FTC group, at least 1 
study drug component was detected in any plasma or cell specimen from 3 participants [Grant, 
2010].

Cisgender women: The FEM-PrEP study was stopped early due to lack of efficacy attributable to low 
drug adherence; less than 40% of the HIV-uninfected women in the TDF/FTC group had evidence 
of recent pill use at visits that were matched to the HIV-infection window for women with 
seroconversion [Van Damme, 2012]. Similarly, all tenofovir-based regimens assessed in the VOICE 
trial failed to significantly reduce the risk of HIV acquisition, and the lack of efficacy was associated 
with low adherence as assessed by measurement of tenofovir levels in plasma [Marrazzo, 2015].
Alternatives to daily oral PrEP
Apart from daily oral TDF/FTC the following PrEP regimens have been studied or approved:

Individuals who are not at ongoing risk for HIV infection can consider using “on demand” (also 
known as “intermittent,” “non-daily,” or “event-driven”) PrEP, not approved in the EU.
The dapivirine vaginal ring may provide a long-acting option for HIV-uninfected women for PrEP to 
reduce the risk of HIV-1 infection via vaginal intercourse in combination with safer sex practices when 
oral PrEP is not used, cannot be used, or is not available. The dapivirine vaginal ring 25 mg was 
assessed by the EMA as part of its coordinated efforts with the WHO to evaluate medicines not 
intended for use in the EU and was provided with a positive opinion on 23 July 2020. Two clinical 
studies, The Ring Study and ASPIRE, demonstrated a 27-31% risk reduction of HIV acquisition among 
women who used the dapivirine ring [Nel, 2016; Baeten, 2016]. Both clinical studies were followed by 
open-label extension studies, DREAM and HOPE, which illustrated an increase in use of the vaginal ring 
and a slightly higher risk reduction of approximately 50% (39% - 62%) [Nel, 2021; Baeten, 2021]. As 
a result, the WHO updated its clinical guidelines to include a conditional recommendation that the 
dapivirine vaginal ring can be offered as an additional prevention choice for women as a part of 
combination prevention strategy [WHO, 2021]. Although the prolonged drug exposure associated with 
Assessment report 
EMA/360205/2023 
Page 142/150
an every month dosing regimen may improve adherence, some of the associated risks of the inserted 
vaginal ring – including urinary tract infection, vaginal discharge, vulvovaginal pruritus, vulvovaginitis, 
and pelvic pain – may impose some limitations on acceptability. In addition, this PrEP regimen is only 
an option for women.
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies
Study 201738/HTPN 083
Title: A Phase IIb/III Double Blind Safety and Efficacy Study of Injectable Cabotegravir Compared to 
Daily Oral Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate/Emtricitabine (TDF/FTC), for Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis in HIV-
Uninfected Cisgender Men and Transgender Women Who have Sex with Men
Study 201739 / HPTN 084
Title: A Phase 3 Double Blind Safety and Efficacy Study of Long-Acting Injectable Cabotegravir 
Compared to Daily Oral TDF/FTC for Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis in HIV Uninfected Women
The main difference between two pivotal studies above is the population included MSM and TGW in 
HTPN 083 and women in HTPN 084. HTPN083 is a non-inferiority study and HTPN 084 is a superiority 
study. Both use as comparator TDF/FTC.
Both studies include the main population that could benefit from this therapy directly compared with 
the actual approved therapy for PrEP in the EU.
3.2.  Favourable effects
For HPTN 083, results of the primary efficacy endpoint analyses demonstrated that in the PrEP regimen 
containing every 2 months injections of CAB LA a total of 13 incident infections were identified, for an 
incidence of 0.40/100 PY, and 39 in the TDF/FTC group, for an incidence of 1.22/100 PY. Comparing 
the incidence across the groups yields of bias adjusted HR of 0.340 (adjusted 95% CI: 0.18 to 0.62), 
demonstrating a 66.0% reduction in incident HIV infections for participants randomized to receive CAB, 
relative to participants randomized to receive TDF/FTC, in this population of MSM and TGW.
If only non-inferiority but not superiority had been concluded, the efficacy demonstration of 
cabotegravir could have been challenged due to the difficulties to determine an appropriate non-
inferiority margin (variable outcome in the previous TDF/FTC studies). In these studies, the absolute 
efficacy of PrEP has been a function of the level of risk in the treated population and of the adherence 
to prophylaxis. Thus, assay sensitivity could not have been ascertained. Of note, defining an 
appropriate NI-margin was raised as a major concern by the SAWP/CHMP in Scientific advice 
(EMEA/H/SA/2517/2/FU/1/2015/III). 
For HPTN 084, results of the primary efficacy endpoint analyses demonstrated that the PrEP regimen of 
every 2 months injections of CAB LA was superior (p<0.0001) to the daily oral regimen of TDF/FTC in 
preventing acquisition of HIV-1 infection based on the rate of incident HIV-1 infections in Steps 1 and 
2. Comparing the incidence between the groups yields an HR of 0.11 (95% CI 0.04 to 0.31, p-value 
<0.0001) (HR of 0.12 when bias-adjusted for early stopping at second interim analysis) demonstrating 
an 88% reduction in incident HIV-1 infections for participants randomized to receive CAB, relative to 
participants randomized to receive TDF/FTC, in this population of cisgender women.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects
Regarding the adolescent population, the extrapolation exercise for efficacy may be considered 
adequate based on PK modelling even if further efficacy data would be of value. The Applicant specified 
that no efficacy outcomes are foreseen for the adolescent sub-studies of Study HPTN 084-1 and HPTN 
083-1. Nonetheless, data on seroconversions are available and none of the participants developed HIV 
infection.
Of note no data is available on subjects above 75 years old; less than 1% of subjects in HTPN 083 
study where between 65 and 74 years old. No subjects above 35 years were included in HTPN 084.
3.4.  Unfavourable effects
Injection Site Reactions are higher on the CAB arm of both pivotal studies, as expected, and in some 
cases led to product discontinuation (injection site pain, swelling, induration). As expected ISRs are 
considered an AE of special interest to CAB PrEP. Overall, CAB injections were generally well tolerated 
and the overall trend of ISR incidence and intensity decreased over time. ISRs were generally mild 
(Grade 1 to Grade 2), of short duration, and resulted in few study drug discontinuations. However, the 
difference of ISRs drug-related between pivotal studies (81% in CAB group of HPTN 083 vs 38% in 
CAB group of HPTN 084) was observed. The Applicant provided a multifactorial reasoning (e.g. 
number of safety visits in the Step 2 injection phase, prevalence exposure of IM or SC contraceptives 
in HPTN084) to explain the difference of reported ISRs by gender at birth which is acceptable. The 
Applicant also provided description of ISR event not resolved or resolved with sequelae for both HPTN 
083 and HPTN 084 studies that accounted for <0.2% in each study. Most cases were injection pain or 
injection swelling of Grade 1 and 2 in severity; in most of the cases cabotegravir injections were not 
discontinued. CAB injections must be administered to the ventrogluteal (the recommended) or 
dorsogluteal sites. The Applicant was asked to specify, if available, relative frequencies of 
administration modes and to describe ISR incidence by site. This issue is not further pursued given no 
data on frequencies or ISR rate by administration site (ventrogluteal vs dorsogluteal) are available as 
this variable was not foreseen by the protocol. 
Neuropsychiatric events, namely suicide attempts, suicidal ideation, anxiety, somnolence, were more 
frequent in both studies in the CAB arm; although there were confounding factors as stated by the 
applicant, these events are already present in the SmPC of cabotegravir treatment and need to be 
more detailed, mainly because the subjects intended to benefit from this intervention could have 
sometimes underlying baseline risk factors. Moreover, given the neuropsychological functioning in 
adolescents, the relevance of known neuropsychiatric AEs in the context of prophylactic use of CAB for 
adolescent population is unknown.
The Applicant presented a comprehensive review of neuropsychiatric AESI. It is agreed that based on 
the overall similarity of frequency of SAEs, study drug discontinuations and study drug-related cases 
between the CAB and TDF/FTC groups in both pivotal studies, CAB is considered to have in general a 
tolerable neuropsychiatric safety profile when used in these study populations for PrEP. From the 
pivotal studies HPTN 083 and 084 and the supportive studies for participants who developed 
neuropsychiatric AEs, the Applicant reviewed the time to onset of these AEs and the time to onset 
since the last CAB LA injection. CAB LA reaches T-max at 7 days. The time to onset since the start of 
CAB and since CAB LA is variable, and a temporal relationship was not observed at the time of peak 
plasma CAB concentrations and the occurrence of the Neuropsychiatric AEs observed. Overall, in HPTN 
083, in those <25 years of age, the majority of AEs from the psychiatric disorders SOC were Grade 1-
2, and a higher proportion occurred in age group 22-24 years of age (which was also observed in the 
TDF/FTC arm). In HPTN 084, there were considerably less participants reporting AEs from the 
Assessment report 
EMA/360205/2023 
Page 144/150
psychiatric disorders SOC. Even though, in those <25 years of age the majority of AEs from the 
psychiatric disorders SOC were Grade 1-2 and a higher proportion of these occurred in age group 22-
24 years of age. This was also observed in the TDF/FTC arm. Nevertheless, with new data on 
adolescents exposed to CAB [MOCHA and HPTN 084-01 (that are still ongoing) and for HPTN 083-
01 (considered completed, 9 adolescents)], there is a concern of potentially higher rate of some 
psychiatric AEs (in particular, suicidal ideation/attempt) with respect to adult subjects; hence 
discussion with additional analysis was requested and provided. Although clinical studies did not show 
an increased incidence of psychiatric illness in adolescents in respect to adult subjects, a warning in 
section 4.4 of the SmPC was included to invite the prescribing physician to accurately counsel the 
adolescents before the prescription and during the treatment.  
In regard to hepatotoxicity, the incidence and severity of clinical chemistry abnormalities is comparable 
between treatment groups. However, differences of Grade 1-2 liver function test abnormalities 
between HPTN 083 and HPTN 084 (more than twice the proportion among MSM and transgender 
women as compared to cisgender women) were found. Hence, the applicant was requested to explain 
this difference but failed to provide an adequate response. Although the Applicant states that across 
the groups, no clinically significant differences were observed for graded abnormalities for any of the 
following parameters: ALT, AST, bilirubin, or lipase, those parameters are albeit with frequency 
uncommon already in the SmPC of CAB treatment. The Applicant acknowledged that bilirubin is 
considered an ADR in the SmPC for CAB PrEP and the 4.8 section of the SmPC was changed 
accordingly. In what concerns to lipase elevations, the analysis provided by the Applicant is endorsed. 
The frequencies of the reported events of increased lipase across both study arms and between trials 
in the CAB PrEP pivotal studies were similar. All events were non-serious, the majority were Grade 1 to 
3 in severity, and resolved without interruption or discontinuation of study drug. Moreover, it is 
acknowledged that lipase elevations are common in people living with HIV and that increased lipase is 
a recognized ADR with rilpivirine. 
Regarding ‘Transaminase increase’ it was proposed as an ADR for inclusion in Section 4.8 of the CAB 
PrEP SmPC under the Hepatobiliary Disorders SOC at the time of submission of the MAA, this was 
amended for inclusion under the Investigations SOC. In contrast to CAB treatment, this ADR has been 
proposed at a frequency of ‘very common’ based on reporting rates in the CAB PrEP clinical trial 
programme from the pivotal trials HPTN 083 and HPTN 084 and supportive studies ÉCLAIR and 
HPTN 077. 
Considering the new data on a relevant number of CAB-exposed pregnancies provided with the 
responses, the Applicant clarified how many of these have received CAB injections during pregnancy, 
duration of exposure and maternal and foetal outcomes. In total (data lock point 23rd May 2023), 
there were 314 confirmed pregnancies on CAB, 218 where the participant received CAB LA during their 
pregnancy and 96 where the participant had received CAB LA within a year of the estimated pregnancy 
start date but not during their pregnancy. There were only 2 congenital anomalies. Regarding 
uncertainties of INSTI exposure on foetal outcomes, the Applicant summarized cumulative data from 
different databases/registries and none confirmed or refuted the NTD signal.
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects
There are no major uncertainties based on the observed clinical safety profile. The Applicant has 
provided an update of all post-marketing data related to CAB PrEP/Apretude since the initial approval 
(20 December 2021) up to 6 March 2023. A total of 216 cases were retrieved from the GSK safety 
database, of those 21 (10%) met the criteria for a SAE report. The safety profile reported is consistent 
with the established profile that has been seen in the clinical studies for both CAB PrEP and CAB 
treatment and post-marketing experience with CAB treatment. 
Assessment report 
EMA/360205/2023 
Page 145/150
Identified risks of hypersensitivity, including angioedema and urticaria, and suicide attempt and 
suicidal ideation were reflected in the 4.8 section of the SmPC. The neuropsychiatric events seem more 
frequent in the cabotegravir arm of both studies. Although clinical studies did not show an increased 
incidence of psychiatric illness in adolescents in respect to adult subjects, caution is need when 
prescribing cabotegravir in this vulnerable population, particularly for pre-existing psychiatric illness, 
which is reflected in section 4.4 of the SmPC. At present, safety data for adolescent population as well 
as pregnant and breastfeeding women is limited.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects
Studies HTPN083 and HTPN 084 were robust, double blind, using as comparator TDF/FTC (the actual 
approved therapy for PrEP in the EU) and included MSM and TGW (HTPN083) and cisgender women 
(HTPN084). In HTPN083 the non-inferiority and HTPN 084 the superiority against TDF/FTC was proven.
The safety of cabotegravir is overall favourable and consistent with the established profile that has 
been seen in the clinical studies for both CAB PrEP and CAB treatment and post-marketing experience 
with CAB treatment.
The ISR were more common, as expected, in the Cabotegravir arm of both studies and sometimes lead 
to product discontinuation. The unfavourable effects known to date namely neuropsychiatric events, 
seem more frequent in the cabotegravir arm of both studies.  Although clinical studies did not show an 
increased incidence of psychiatric illness in adolescents in respect to adult subjects, caution is need 
when prescribing cabotegravir in this vulnerable population, particularly for pre-existing psychiatric 
illness.
According to the PDCO (EMEA-C-001418-PIP02-15-M03), the submitted PIP is in full compliance check 
with the measures included in the PIP in the view of the MAA for the prevention of HIV-1 indication in 
adults and adolescents 12 to <18 years of age and weighing >=35kg.
The SmPC and the PL have been revised to address these issues. In addition, post authorization 
measures have been proposed and added as part of the RMP ( please see section 2.6)
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks
The benefit/risk balance of Apretude in the claimed indication is positive.
3.8.  Conclusions
The overall benefit/risk balance of Apretude is positive.

4.  Recommendations
Outcome
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Apretude is favourable in the following indication(s):
Apretude is indicated in combination with safer sex practices for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to 
reduce the risk of sexually acquired HIV-1 infection in high-risk adults and adolescents, weighing at 
least 35 kg (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1).
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions:
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2).
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation 
 Periodic Safety Update Reports
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation.
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product
 Risk Management Plan (RMP)
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and 
interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and 
any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP.
An updated RMP should be submitted:

At the request of the European Medicines Agency;
 Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.
 Additional risk minimisation measures 
Prior to the launch of Apretude in a Member State, the MAH must agree the content and format of the 
educational materials, including communication media, distribution modalities, and any other aspects 
of the program, with the National Competent Authority.
To supplement routine risk minimisation activities, the educational materials are aimed at mitigating 
the risks of HIV seroconversion, the development of resistance and medication errors, including 
treatment noncompliance in individuals taking Apretude by increasing awareness of these risks and 
providing guidance information for prescribers and individuals at risk.
The MAH shall ensure that in each Member State where Apretude is marketed, all healthcare 
Assessment report 
EMA/360205/2023 
Page 148/150
professionals and individuals at risk who are expected to prescribe and/or use Apretude have access 
to/are provided with the following educational package, which comprises of the following: 
 Guide for prescribers
 Guide for individuals at risk 


Prescribers’ checklist
Reminder Card for individuals at risk
Key messages of the additional risk minimization measures for Apretude for Pre Exposure Prophylaxis 
(PrEP) are outlined below. 
Guide for prescribers shall contain the following elements:
 Details on use of Apretude for pre-exposure prophylaxis as part of an overall HIV-1 infection 
prevention strategy including the use of other HIV-1 prevention measures (such as e. g. 
knowledge of HIV-1 status, regular testing for other sexually transmitted infections, condom 
use). 



Reminder that Apretude should only be used to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV-1 in individuals 
confirmed to be HIV negative. 
Individuals should be re-confirmed to be HIV-negative at each injection visit while taking 
Apretude for pre-exposure prophylaxis.
If clinical symptoms consistent with acute viral infection are present and recent (< 1 month) 
exposures to HIV-1 are suspected, HIV-1 status should be reconfirmed. 
 Details on the potential risk of developing resistance to Apretude if an individual acquires HIV-
1 either before, or taking Apretude, or following discontinuation of Apretude. 


Importance of commencing antiretroviral therapy (ART) in instances of HIV-1 acquisition in 
individuals who are suspected or confirmed with a diagnosis of HIV-1. 
Apretude does not constitute a complete ART regimen for the treatment of HIV 1 and HIV 
resistance mutations have emerged in individuals with undetected HIV 1 infection who were 
only taking Apretude. 

Consideration of alternative forms of non-long-acting PrEP following discontinuation of 
Apretude injection for those individuals that remain at risk of HIV acquisition, which should be 
initiated within 2 months of the final Apretude injection. 

Importance of counselling individuals at risk periodically to strictly adhere to the recommended 
Apretude dosing schedule/appointments to reduce the risk of HIV-1 acquisition and the 
potential development of resistance.
Prescriber checklist shall provide reminders for evaluations and counselling at initial and 
follow up visit, including:



Test to re-confirm HIV-1 negative status at each injection visit to minimise the risk of 
developing resistance to Apretude. 
To reconfirm HIV-1 status, if clinical symptoms consistent with acute viral infection are present 
and recent (< 1 month) exposures to HIV-1 are suspected.
To commence antiretroviral therapy (ART) in instances of HIV-1 acquisition in individuals who

are suspected or confirmed with a diagnosis of HIV-1. 

To discuss and reiterate the importance of adherence to the recommended Apretude dosing 
schedule/appointments to reduce the risk of HIV-1 acquisition and the potential development 
of resistance.

To summarise and restate that Apretude for pre-exposure prophylaxis is part of an overall HIV-
1 infection prevention strategy including the use of other HIV-1 prevention measures (such as 
e. g. knowledge of HIV-1 status, regular testing for other sexually transmitted infections, 
condom use).

To consider alternative forms of non-long-acting PrEP following discontinuation of Apretude 
injection for those individuals that remain at risk of HIV acquisition, which should be initiated 
within 2 months of the final Apretude injection.
Guide for Individuals at risk shall contain the following elements:
Important information individuals at risk need to know before, while taking and after stopping 
Apretude including:

Requirements that Apretude for pre-exposure prophylaxis is part of an overall HIV-1 infection

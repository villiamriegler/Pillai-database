2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product designation in 2005 was 
based on the following grounds: 
• 
• 
• 
α-Mannosidosis (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to be affecting 
approximately 0.01 in 10,000 persons in the Community at the time the application was made; 
the condition is chronically debilitating and life-threatening, in particular due to severe clinical 
features (mental retardation, hearing loss, immune deficiency, myopathy, dysostosis) and 
premature death in severe cases; 
there is, at present, no satisfactory treatment that has been authorised in the Community for 
patients affected by the condition. 
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation 
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Α-mannosidosis is a monogenic autosomal recessive disorder, consisting of a deficiency of lysosomal α-
mannosidase (LAMAN). It is caused by mutations in the MAN2B1 gene on chromosome 19 which codes 
for the enzyme α-mannosidase. The effect of the enzyme deficiency is blockage of the degradation of 
glycoproteins, which results in the accumulation of mannose rich oligosaccharides in all tissues. 
Progressive lysosomal accumulation of non-degradable metabolites results in generalized cell and 
tissue dysfunction and multi-systemic pathologies. Depending on the residual enzymatic activity, 
epigenetics and disease modifying factors the disease presentation and the burden of disease differs. 
The COMP confirms that the condition as designated is still valid for orphan designation. The approved 
therapeutic indication “enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of non-neurological 
manifestations in patients with mild to moderate alpha mannosidosis” falls within the scope of the 
designated orphan indication “treatment of α-Mannosidosis”. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
Based on the CHMP assessment, the intention to treat the condition has been justified.  
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
At the time of initial designation, the COMP agreed with the sponsor that the condition was chronically 
debilitating and life-threatening.  
The sponsor is of the opinion that the condition remains chronically debilitating with a continuous 
clinical spectrum with no clear stratification of patients based on disease severity and phenotypes. 
Typical clinical symptoms include coarse facial characteristics, mental retardation, ataxia, hearing 
impairment, impaired speech, recurrent infections, skeletal abnormalities, muscular pain and 
weakness. The long term outcome results in irreversible clinical pathology.

Regarding the life-threatening aspects, the sponsor outlines that there is very limited published 
evidence on longevity in α-mannosidosis. Only one published report discusses α-mannosidosis patients 
over the age of 50 (Malm D et al 2008). The sponsor commissioned a survey, which has been 
presented to the COMP in its entirety because it has not been published.  Feedback was obtained from 
3 experts and 16 physicians experienced in the treatment α-mannosidosis in 9 countries. The survey 
did not identify patients older than 41 years of age.  
The COMP confirms that the condition remains life- threatening with premature death in severe cases 
and chronically debilitating due to coarse facial characteristics, mental retardation, ataxia, hearing 
impairment, impaired speech, recurrent infections, skeletal abnormalities, muscular pain and 
weakness.  
Number of people affected or at risk 
At the time of designation the prevalence was agreed to be approximately 0.01 per 10,000. The 
sponsor is of the opinion that the prevalence remains less than 5 per 10,000 and is estimated to be 
approximately 0.02 per 10,000.  
Prevalence was estimated through a survey that was commissioned by the sponsor, which has been 
presented to the COMP in its entirety because it has not been published. This survey was distributed to 
physicians and key opinion leaders across Europe. The results are based on the feedback received 
which comprises of 4 European key opinion leaders and 16 European physicians experienced in the 
treatment α-mannosidosis (table 1; data from Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, 
Poland, Spain, and United Kingdom). The prevalence estimate ranges from 1:200,000 (0.05 per 
10,000) to 1:4,700,000 (0.002 per 10,000), when excluding Italy with a very low prevalence figure. 
It can be acknowledged that there is little published information on the epidemiology of the condition. 
The prevalence of α-mannosidosis reported in the literature ranges from 1:500 000-1:1 000 000 
worldwide. The most conservative number from the survey indicates a prevalence of 0.05 per 10,000 
in the UK. This is below the threshold defined in the orphan legislation. The COMP could designate less 
than 0.1 as a very conservative estimate taking into consideration the uncertainty around the lack of 
epidemiological data.

opinion leaders in Europe (source is a report commissioned by the sponsor) 
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
The sponsor has established that there are currently no authorised products for the treatment of α-
mannosidosis. 
The sponsor has also established that the existing methods for treatment cannot be considered 
satisfactory. The most severe patients are potential candidates for haematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation or bone marrow transplantation. Supportive care include symptom management, 
medical and surgical treatment of complications (e.g. infections, skeletal deformities), and physical 
therapy.

Significant benefit 
Significant benefit does not have to be established, because the current methods for treatment are not 
considered satisfactory.

4.  COMP position adopted on 26 January 2018 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan indication of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product. 
the prevalence of α-Mannosidosis (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to 
remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded in to be less than 0.1 in 10,000 persons in the 
European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is life- threatening leading to premature death in severe cases and chronically 
debilitating due to coarse facial characteristics, mental retardation, ataxia, hearing impairment, 
impaired speech, recurrent infections, skeletal abnormalities, muscular pain and weakness; 
there is, at present, no satisfactory treatment that has been authorised in the European Union for 
patients affected by the condition.  
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Lamzede, recombinant human α-
Mannosidase, velmanase alfa, EU/3/04/260 for treatment of α-Mannosidosis is not removed from the 
Community Register of Orphan Medicinal Products.

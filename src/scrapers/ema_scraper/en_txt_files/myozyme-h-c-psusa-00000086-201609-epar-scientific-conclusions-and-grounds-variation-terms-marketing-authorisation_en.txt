Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for alglucosidase alfa, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
-  Considering the information provided on the reported consequences related to extravasation of 
alglucosidase alfa, PRAC considered that update of the product information was warranted with inclusion 
of the adverse reactions infusion site swelling, infusion site induration and infusion site extravasation 
with a frequency not known.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for alglucosidase alfa the CHMP is of the opinion that the 
benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing alglucosidase alfa is unchanged subject to 
the proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

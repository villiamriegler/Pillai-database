2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Neurotrophic keratitis (NK) is a rare, degenerative corneal disease that occurs as a result of partial or total 
impairment of trigeminal innervation, leading to a reduction (hypoesthesia) in or loss (anaesthesia) of 
corneal sensation (Bonini et al., 2003; Sacchetti et al, 2014; Semeraro et al, 2014). Impairment of corneal 
trigeminal innervation causes a reduction in the lacrimation reflex, as well as morphological and metabolic 
corneal epithelial disturbances, with subsequent development of recurrent or persistent epithelial defects.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
As  the  underlying  causes  for  NK  are  numerous  and  heterogeneous,  accurate  prevalence  calculations  are 
difficult  to  conduct.  Based  on  the  prevalence  of  a  range  of  predisposing  or  accompanying  conditions,  NK 
prevalence  can  be  estimated  at  less  than  4.1 per  10,000  patients.  Patients  with  stage  2  and  3  disease  are 
estimated to constitute approximately one third of the total NK population.  
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Several ocular and systemic conditions can be associated with damage at different levels of the fifth cranial 
nerve, from the trigeminal nucleus to the corneal nerve endings, resulting in the development of NK. The 
most common causes of impaired corneal sensation are herpetic keratitis (herpes simplex and herpes zoster 
viral infection), intracranial space-occupying lesions, and/or neurosurgical procedures that damage the 
trigeminal ophthalmic branch. Other ocular causes of impairment of corneal sensitivity include chemical 
burns, physical injuries, corneal dystrophy, chronic use of topical medications (topical anaesthetics, timolol, 
betaxolol, sulfacetamide, and diclofenac sodium), and anterior segment surgery involving nerve transection. 
Many systemic conditions are also associated with the development of corneal anaesthesia, including 
diabetes, multiple sclerosis, congenital syndromes, and leprosy. 
Loss of corneal sensory innervation causes a marked change in the levels of neuromediators, and 
consequently dystrophic changes in corneal and conjunctival tissues. The corneal epithelium is usually the 
primary site of disease expression, showing a decrease in the vitality, metabolism and mitosis of epithelial 
cells and consequently epithelial breakdown. Epithelial breakdown can lead to ulceration, infection, melting, 
perforation secondary to poor healing, and, ultimately, loss of eye sight. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Patients with NK rarely complain of ocular symptoms, and there is a significant discrepancy between clinical 
findings and subjective symptoms. A classification based on disease severity was proposed by Mackie (1995), 
who distinguished three stages (1 to 3 in order of increasing severity): 
Assessment report  
EMA/351805/2017 
Page 11/104 
 
  
  
  Stage 1 is characterized by punctate keratopathy and/or corneal epithelial hyperplasia and 
irregularity, which may be associated with superficial neovascularization and stromal scarring. In 
addition dry eye signs may be observed, including vital dye staining of the inferior palpebral 
conjunctiva and decreased tear film break-up time. 
  Stage 2 is characterized by a persistent corneal epithelial defect (PED), typically oval or circular in 
shape, with smooth and rolled edges. An area of poorly adherent opaque and oedematous epithelium 
is typically found rolled-up around the margin of the epithelial defect. Oedema of the corneal stroma 
may also be present, and it is not uncommon to observe also an inflammatory reaction in the anterior 
chamber. 
 
In Stage 3 the corneal stroma is involved and a corneal ulcer is observed. Corneal ulceration tends to 
progress to perforation and/or stromal melting if not promptly and properly treated. Corneal melting 
and perforation can also be iatrogenic, caused by inappropriate use of topical steroids or by 
secondary infections of the non-healing ulcer. 
The prognosis of NK depends upon the specific cause behind the corneal sensory impairment, the degree of 
corneal hypo-/anaesthesia, and the association with other ocular surface diseases such as dry eye, exposure 
keratitis, and limbal stem cell deficiency. Progression to more severe disease stages is associated with a high 
and imminent risk of sight loss due to anatomical loss of the eye or to permanent loss of corneal 
transparency. NK also predisposes to secondary bacterial infection of non-healing epithelial defects. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Treatment of NK depends on the disease severity (Abelson and McLaughlin, 2014; Bonini et al, 2003; 
Giannaccare et al., 2015; Mantelli et al., 2015; Sacchetti et al, 2014; Semeraro et al, 2014). Treatment for 
stage 1 disease aims at improving epithelial quality and transparency and avoiding epithelial breakdown. In 
the presence of PED (stage 2), therapy is aimed at preventing stromal involvement and corneal ulcer 
formation as well as promoting corneal healing. In more severe cases, when a corneal ulcer develops 
(stage 3), therapy is aimed at preventing or stopping corneal melting and perforation in order to preserve 
eye sight.  
Preservative-free artificial tears are used at all stages of disease severity to help improve corneal surface 
integrity. Topical steroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may inhibit the healing process and 
should be avoided. Use of topical antibiotic eye drops to prevent infection in eyes with NK at stages 2 and 3 
is recommended. Furthermore, different blood-derived eye drops obtained from autologous serum, cord 
blood serum, and platelet rich plasma have been used to promote corneal healing because of their high 
concentrations of growth factors. 
Non-pharmacological treatments for NK include therapeutic corneal or scleral (bandage) contact lenses in the 
event of PED. Contact lens wear may however increase the risk of secondary infections.  
Surgical treatments are reserved for refractory cases. Partial or total tarsorrhaphy is used to cover a PED and 
promote healing. Alternatively, closure of the eyelids can be achieved by using a palpebral spring or 
botulinum A toxin injection of the eyelid elevator muscle. Furthermore, conjunctival flap is able to restore 
ocular surface integrity and provide metabolic and mechanical support for corneal healing. Both tarsorrhaphy 
and conjunctival flap are effective surgical procedures for promoting corneal healing, but have a poor 
cosmetic outcome and visual function is sacrificed.

Amniotic membrane transplantation is a short-term option in the management of refractory neurotrophic 
corneal ulcers. In case of smaller perforations cyanoacrylate glue can be used, whereas larger defects require 
lamellar or penetrating keratoplasty. The success rate of corneal transplants in NK patients is however low 
due to the lack of trophic support, with consequent poor wound healing and risk of PED recurrence. 
Although preservative-free artificial tears and therapeutic contact lenses can be effective in limiting the 
progression of patients from stage 1 to stage 2 and stage 3 disease, there are no pharmaceutical treatments 
authorised for patients with stage 2 and 3 NK who are refractory to the above treatments. Furthermore, none 
of the treatment options used in clinical practice can reinstate corneal innervation and improve corneal 
sensation. 
2.1.6.  About the product 
Cenegermin is a recombinant form of human nerve growth factor (rhNGF) produced in Escherichia coli as a 
pro-peptide, which is later cleaved to mature NGF. NGF is a neurotrophin, which is naturally present in the 
eye and is essential for the survival and growth of sympathetic and sensory neurons and for differentiation of 
neurons in the central nervous system (CNS). Activation of its receptors has been shown to play a role in the 
trophism of the cornea (de Castro et al., 1998; Smeyne et al., 1994) and there is evidence in the scientific 
literature of efficacy of murine NGF (mNGF) in the treatment of patients with moderate and severe (stage 2 
and 3) NK unresponsive to other non-surgical treatments participated in the studies (Bonini et al., 2000; 
Lambiase et al., 2007). 
Oxervate contains 20 μg/ml cenegermin in a preservative-free sterile eye drop solution. It is presented in 
vials for daily use, with 1 drop being administered 6 times daily. Both cenegermin and rhNGF are used 
interchangeable in this report when referring to the active substance. 
Oxervate is proposed for the use in the treatment of moderate (persistent epithelial defect) or severe 
(corneal ulcer) NK in adults, corresponding to disease stages 2 and 3. The applicant proposed that treatment 
should be initiated and supervised by an ophthalmologist or a healthcare professional qualified in 
ophthalmology, which was agreed by the CHMP. 
2.1.7.  Type of Application and aspects on development 
This was a complete and independent application made under Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
The CHMP agreed the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was considered to be 
of major public health interest. This was based on the understanding that the medicinal product potentially 
implies an innovative therapeutic approach for a clinical condition that constitutes an unmet medical need. 
The potential benefits of Oxervate in the treatment for moderate to severe NK patients include the control of 
this sight-threatening condition with a pharmacological (non-surgical) treatment without preventing 
subsequent surgical intervention. 
During the product development, the applicant sought scientific advice and protocol assistance from the 
CHMP on several occasions on quality, non-clinical and clinical aspects.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The active substance in Oxervate, cenegermin, is a recombinant human Nerve Growth factor (rhNGF) 
produced in E. coli strain HMS174. The molecule is identical to human Nerve Growth factor (NGF), a naturally 
occurring human protein. 
In humans, NGF is naturally produced as pre-pro-peptide, secreted into the endoplasmic reticulum and 
cleaved by furin protease. The pro-sequence is further cleaved during the production process by enzymatic 
hydrolysis. Therefore these two amino acid changes have no influence on the final active ingredient (rhNGF), 
which is identical to the naturally secreted human protein. The 3D structure of rhNGF is a non-covalent dimer 
with three intra-molecular disulphide bridges.  
Cenegermin contains 118 amino acids and has a relative molecular mass of 13,266 Daltons and the following 
molecular formula: C583H908N166O173S8. Figure 1 shows the protein sequence of recombinant human ProNGFrh 
ProNGF (Figure 1A), and a map of the disulphide bridges (Figure IB):

NGF is essential for the survival and growth of sympathetic and sensory neurons and for differentiation of 
neurons in the central nervous system. NGF acts through specific high affinity (i.e. Tropomyosin receptor 
kinase A (Trk A)) and low affinity (i.e., p75NTR) NGF receptors. NGF receptors are expressed on anterior 
segments of the eye (iris, ciliary body, lens, cornea and conjunctiva) and by the lacrimal gland as well as by 
all the intra-ocular tissues. Activation of these receptors by NGF plays a role in the tropism of the cornea. 
The NGF biological activity is evaluated in vitro by using human bone marrow erythroblast suspension cell 
line expressing the TrkA receptor. Binding of NGF to Trk A is fully functional in the cell line because it is able 
to induce TrkA autophosphorylation and also trigger signalling events inside the cell that lead to cell 
proliferation.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Cenegermin active substance is produced by Dompé farmaceutici S.p.A., Via Campo di Pile snc 67100, 
L’Aquila, Italy.  
The manufacturing process is a multilevel stage process, starting from thawing of five vials of a working cell 
bank (WCB) followed by several cell expansion steps. The manufacturing process has been adequately 
described.  Critical process parameters (CPP), in-process controls (IPC) and critical in-process controls are 
highlighted, with acceptance criteria when relevant. The active substance manufacturing process is 
considered to be acceptable.  
Assessment report  
EMA/351805/2017

Cenegermin active substance is stored at -20°C ± 5°C in validated freezers until ready for further processing. 
Cenegermin is shipped in dry ice at not more than (NMT) -15°C following approved packaging procedures, 
using qualified shipping containers under conditions that have been validated. 
No reprocessing is mentioned for the manufacturing process of cenegermin. 
Control of materials 
Expression plasmid 
The expression plasmid and the procedure for its preparation have been described in sufficient detail. 
Cell bank development 
A two-tiered cell culture system is used for the production of cenegermin. The preparation of the master cell 
bank (MCB) and working cell bank (WCB) is described in sufficient detail. Gram test and microscopic 
characterisation, plasmid retention, viable cell count performed according to an approved internal analytical 
monograph, and gene DNA sequence, plasmid copy number and bacteriophage contamination performed by 
contract laboratories are adequately studied and described. The MCB and WCB have been appropriately 
characterised. 
In general, the description of generation of the plasmid construct and primary and master cell banks is 
adequately described. DNA sequencing, including vector flanking regions (50 – 100 base pairs (bp)) was 
performed on the MCB and results presented that confirmed the correct sequence. The correct protein 
expression confirmation was performed by using Western Blot analysis on both MCB and WCB.  This is in 
accordance with the requirements of the Ph. Eur. monograph on Recombinant DNA technology products and 
ICH Q5B for the characterisation of MCB and WCB.  
During the procedure, questions were raised on the genetic stability of the cells up to and beyond full scale 
fermentation of the WCB and the limit for in vitro cell age. The Applicant has provided adequate 
documentation and has justified the maximum calculated number of duplications and a time limit proposed 
for the whole fermentation process, which is considered acceptable. 
Other materials 
All raw materials are purchased from qualified vendors and are pharmacopoeial grade when possible. No 
materials of animal/human origin are used for the production of cenegermin active substance. In addition, no 
raw materials of human/animal origin have been used in the production of the starting materials.  
The certificates of analysis have been included and confirming that all materials are free of transmissible 
spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). 
Internal procedures, based on the good manufacturing practice (GMP) and international conference for 
harmonisation (ICH) requirements, describe in detail the procedures for receipt, identification, storage, 
handling, sampling, testing, and approval or rejection of raw materials. These procedures provide assurance 
that materials are maintained in a controlled manner throughout quarantine and release procedures. 
The incoming raw materials and the single-use devices used during the active substance manufacturing 
process are classified on the basis of a risk analysis considering all the critical risk factors concerning the 
nature of the material that may have impact on the quality of the final product, of the process and the 
Assessment report  
EMA/351805/2017 
Page 16/104 
 
  
  
 
 
 
process step in which the material is used. On the basis of this classification, the raw materials are 
completely or partially reanalysed by the Applicant. 
In the original submission, no information was provided in relation to the control of single use equipment, 
filters/column resins used during the manufacturing process. The Applicant has provided sufficient 
information in relation to the single use equipment and the filters. In relation to the chromatography resins it 
is confirmed that these are of synthetic origin and that no materials of animal origin were used during their 
manufacture.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
A comprehensive overview of critical in-process controls and critical in-process tests performed throughout 
cenegermin active substance manufacture is given. The active substance manufacturing process is controlled 
by critical process parameters (CPP), in-process controls (IPC) and critical in-process controls (CIPC) that 
have been established to ensure consistent process performance and product quality. All excursions from 
CPP, IPC and CIPC ranges are investigated. Excursions from CIPC may result in batch rejection, as deviation 
from the range is likely to affect product quality. Corrective and preventive actions (which include batch 
rejection) are implemented as required.  
The control ranges have been established during the manufacturing process development and confirmed 
during the manufacturing process validation. The Pro Nerve growth factor inclusion body (ProNGF IB) 
Intermediate is the only process intermediate of the manufacturing process of rhNGF active substance. It is 
stored frozen at -70±5°C until subsequent processing in 2 L capacity sterile pyrogen-free polyethylene 
terephthalate copolyester, glycol modified PETG bottles, closed with a high density polyethylene (HDPE) 
screw cap. Each batch of ProNGF IB Intermediate is subjected to release testing. Stability data are presented 
that support the storage conditions claimed for the intermediate. 
During the procedure a major objection was raised in relation to the proposed manufacturing process control 
strategy. The Applicant was requested to provide more information on the manufacturing process control 
strategy to ensure quality of the active substance. The applicant provided a more thorough discussion of the 
development of the manufacturing process control strategy with the provision of extensive background 
information. The basis for defining the current CQAs is now appropriately described including an updated risk 
assessment matrix, explanation of the relationship between CQAs and the elaboration of CPPs/MPPs/IPCs for 
the process. The applicant also provided a detailed explanation of how criticality of process parameters and 
in-process controls was determined.  
Process validation 
The cenegermin active substance manufacturing process has been adequately validated.  
During the procedure a major objection was raised in relation to process validation and the CQAs, which were 
considered insufficient to ensure consistent quality. A justification was requested for the control strategy 
explaining how criticality of process parameters and in-process controls was determined.  
During the procedure the Applicant was able to resolve the major objection on process control and validation. 
As mentioned in the section ‘Control of Critical Steps and Intermediates,’ the Applicant provided the 
information requested. Relevant monitored process parameters (MPPs) or in-process monitoring (IPM), while 
not considered critical by the applicant, were registered in the dossier as part of the control strategy. In 
relation to the proposed acceptance criteria, data was provided to support the target ranges for process 
parameters and in-process controls examined during the process validation studies. The developmental and 
edge of range studies used to set these target ranges were provided. Where historical batch data was 
Assessment report  
EMA/351805/2017 
Page 17/104 
 
  
  
combined with process validation (PV) batch data to set acceptance criteria for IPCs, information was 
supported with results from historical batches in question. The strategy for defining acceptance criteria for 
process parameters and IPCs was justified with reference to statistical evaluation of data, where relevant. 
Furthermore, as the control strategy was developed using data from previous manufacturing processes (edge 
of range/development studies, historical batch data) this was further justified in the context of comparability 
to the proposed commercial process.   
A number of specific issues were raised, all of them were solved except the control of refolding of the protein 
where more data was requested, and the process related impurities where the registration and justification of 
limits for control of these impurities was also requested. Now, the applicant has provided sufficient 
information on both issues and they are considered solved. 
The sufficiency of the critical in process control (CIPC) for culture purity during fermentation was queried and 
the Applicant has introduced additional tests for its control that are considered adequate. Numerous 
additional queries were raised reflecting the fundamental lack of clarity afforded by the data presented in 
relation to process control and design thereof. All queries have now been sufficiently addressed.  
In relation to the chromatography columns, a query was raised on the sufficiency of leachable/extractable 
studies performed; the applicant provided additional data including the reports for leachables from the AEX 
and CEX columns and the information is considered adequate.  In addition, the compatibility of the substance 
with contact materials during the manufacturing process was not considered and this point was raised. The 
applicant provided the leachable/extractable studies confirming that the leachables present in the finished 
product Oxervate Eye Drops coming from the active substance are not a safety concern. There is a single 
intermediate during the manufacturing process; ProNGF IB intermediate is stored at -70° C for up to 1 year 
prior to performance of the solubilisation step. Queries were raised in terms of the control specifications, 
proposed primary packaging and shelf life for the intermediate. The requested information was provided. 
Characterisation 
The analytical package to characterise cenegermin includes SDS-PAGE, peptide mapping, SE-HPLC, RP-HPLC, 
IEX-HPLC, potency assay, N-terminal sequencing by Edman degradation, amino acid composition and protein 
concentration by amino acid analysis, secondary structure determination by Circular Dichroism (CD) and 
intact molecular weight determination by mass spectroscopy.  
Data of some reference standard assays were initially not described or presented for review. This was 
summarized during the procedure as a major objection on characterisation. A more thorough characterisation 
study was requested and, specifically, further information was requested on the purity profile, functional 
characterisation, protein modifications and secondary/tertiary structure of the active substance.  
During the procedure the Applicant provided the data from the analyses by SDS-PAGE gels, peptide mapping, 
SE-HPLC, RP-HPLC and IEX-HPLC, performed on rhNGF reference standards RS1213 and RS0515, and on 
rhProNGF reference standard RS0115. In addition, data obtained from the detection of aggregates by AUC 
and from SDS-PAGE in reducing and non-reducing conditions in gels silver stained were provided. 
The major objection on characterisation was considered to be resolved on the basis of the information 
provided and taking into consideration the Applicant’s commitment to conduct a number of post-authorisation 
follow-up studies as detailed under Recommendations (see recommendations 1 – 7, section 2.2.6). 
In relation to the purity profile, the use of a single method for detection of product related impurities (RP-
HPLC) and the suitability of SE-HPLC, SDS-PAGE and IEX-HPLC as purity methods capable of detecting 
impurities was queried. The Applicant has addressed the suitability of the purity methods by testing the 
Assessment report  
EMA/351805/2017 
Page 18/104 
 
  
  
capacity of the SE-HPLC and SDS-PAGE methods to separate aggregated material from the main peak 
(during shaking stress degradation studies). Data were also presented to demonstrate that the SE-HPLC and 
SDS-PAGE methods would detect truncated species, if present. Furthermore, the applicant provided data to 
confirm that uncleaved proNGF, oxidated forms of rhNGF and post translation modifications would be 
detected by the RP-HPLC method.  
During the procedure a concern was raised in relation to the capacity of the IEX-HPLC method to detect 
charge variants, if present. The Applicant was requested to propose a suitable amendment to the acceptance 
criterion so that batches with an increase in charge variants present would fail to pass the specification. The 
applicant has now committed to amend the acceptance criterion in relation to the main peak shape as 
requested in a post-authorisation recommendation (see recommendation 2, section 2.2.6).Although this 
technique is not suitable for control of all impurities, the method appears to be suitable for control of impurity 
B and as such, the applicant should register this second method (RP-UPLC-UV) for routine control of impurity 
B. The applicant committed as a post-approval commitment to register the RP-UPLC for routine control of 
impurity B and to provide information about the method, validation and specification levels for impurity B in 
the dossier (see recommendation 1, section 2.2.6). In addition, the Applicant was requested to provide the 
report describing the validation of the RP-HPLC method carried out for the specific named impurities; the 
report was provided and is, in general acceptable, however the applicant has committed to extend the range 
of the validation for impurity F1 (see recommendation 3, section 2.2.6). Furthermore, additional data from 
forced degradation studies (report A1491 with amendments) indicate that the current RP-HPLC method is not 
capable of resolving the main peak from impurities F1 and F2. Therefore, the Applicant has committed to 
updating section 8.5 (Impact of Forced Degradation on Functional Activity) including submitting a visible 
corresponding Figure (Figure 68 in Module 3) and providing the report in which these data are included (se 
recommendation 4, section 2.2.6). The applicant has also provided a commitment that a method capable of 
resolving the main peak from named and unnamed impurities will be developed and registered in the dossier 
(see recommendation 12, section 2.2.6). 
The Applicant has provided a brief discussion to support adequate characterisation of potential post-
translational modifications and has confirmed the suitability of the proposed RP-HPLC method to detect 
relevant post-translational modifications. 
The results of the assays performed for the characterisation of the secondary and tertiary structure were 
presented. The following analytical methods were selected for this purpose: disulphide bond mapping, far and 
near UV circular dichroism, free sulphydryls by Ellman’s assay, intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, FT-IR 
(Fourier Transformed Infrared) spectroscopy, Differential Scanning Calorimetry: the analysis is ongoing, to be 
provided before MA. The Applicant has committed to provide several reports, including data derived from the 
ongoing Differential Scanning Calorimetry analyses before marketing authorization with the closing sequence 
(see recommendation 15, section 2.2.6). 
The potency assay is a cell-based potency assay using a receptor, and is the same method as proposed for 
the finished product release.  
The primary packaging for rhNGF is composed of 500 ml capacity sterile pyrogen-free polyethylene 
terephthalatecopolyester, glycol modified (PETG) bottles, filled with approximately 60% volume of product 
and closed with a high density polyethylene (HDPE) cap. Queries were raised in relation to the Ph. Eur. 
compliance of the primary packaging material and specifications. An extractable/leachable study was 
requested and the Applicant has committed to introduce an extractable study to assess during the in-use 
condition of finished product post-marketing (see recommendation 8, section 2.2.6). Therefore concerns on 
compliance of the primary packaging material and specifications have been resolved and the dossier was 
Assessment report  
EMA/351805/2017 
Page 19/104 
 
  
  
updated to include a description of the characteristic properties of the material (mechanical/physical) and 
sufficient information regarding potential extractables.  
Process related impurities DNA, host cell protein (HCP), Kanamycin sulfate, endotoxin and bioburden are 
controlled through the active substance release specifications.  
Specification 
The active substance specifications include tests for identity, purity (a single method), and potency as well as 
tests for the following process related impurities: host cell proteins, endotoxin, bioburden and kanamycin 
sulfate.  
Initially the specifications were not considered sufficiently justified based on batches representative of the 
proposed commercial process. The Applicant was asked to justify and revise the active substance 
specifications accordingly and to describe the statistical basis for assigning acceptance criteria, where 
relevant. In this regard, the Applicant has now provided an adequate justification of specifications and 
acceptance criteria based on GMP batches used during clinical studies. In addition, the Applicant has provided 
a commitment to review the specifications for protein concentration, potency, purity SE-HPLC, IEX-HPLC, 
residual DNA, residual HCP, bioburden, endotoxin and potency after 10 batches and to tighten, where 
necessary, the acceptance criteria on the basis of this review (see recommendation 6, section 2.2.6). The 
acceptance criteria shall also be reviewed and tightened for identity by peptide mapping as committed to by 
the Applicant (see recommendation 7, section 2.2.6). 
DNA, HCP, Kanamycin sulfate, endotoxin and bioburden were process related impurities controlled in the 
active substance release specifications. In general, the limits for these impurities were justified as part of the 
revised justification of specifications however it was noted the limit for residual DNA is in line with WHO 
recommendations.  
The stated impurities have been studied in nonclinical and clinical studies. 
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) appropriately 
justified.  
The potency assay is a cell-based potency assay using receptor and the assay is based on cell proliferation. 
The same method is also proposed for the finished product release. During the procedure the Applicant 
provided additional information to justify the appropriateness of the chosen method. In addition the Applicant 
has further committed to review the potency range after manufacture of 10 batches and to tighten them in 
accordance with the clinically qualified limits (see recommendation 6, section 2.2.6). 
The analytical tests are considered to be sufficiently validated and demonstrated to be fit for purpose. During 
the procedure a major concern was raised in relation to the RP-HPLC purity method as the RP-HPLC method 
appeared not to distinguish between impurities and potential analytical artefacts and the method validation 
provided was considered inadequate. The Company’s proposal to refer to SE-HPLC and IEX-HPLC as “purity” 
methods was not accepted as these methods appear to lack sensitivity as a method for impurities.  
During the procedure the Applicant was able to resolve the concerns and to demonstrate the suitability of the 
purity methods SE-HPLC and SDS-PAGE to separate aggregated material and fragments from the main peak 
(which are applied during shaking stress degradation studies). Furthermore, the applicant confirmed that 
Assessment report  
EMA/351805/2017 
Page 20/104 
 
  
  
uncleaved proNGF, oxidated forms of rhNGF and post translation modifications would be detected by the RP-
HPLC method.  
In relation to the capacity of the IEX-HPLC method to detect charge variants, if present, the Company has 
agreed to a request to amend the acceptance criterion further post-marketing, this was agreed by the CHMP 
(see recommendation 2, section 2.26). Furthermore, data was presented in relation to an RP-UPLC-UV 
method, which is capable of detecting impurity B. Although this technique is not suitable for control of all 
impurities, the method appears to be suitable for control of impurity B and as such, the applicant committed 
as a post-approval commitment to register the RP-UPLC for routine control of impurity B and to provide 
information about the method, validation and specification levels for impurity B in the dossier (see 
recommendation 1, section 2.2.6). In addition, the Applicant was requested to provide the report describing 
the validation of RP-HPLC method carried out for the specific named impurities; the report was provided and 
is, in general acceptable, however the applicant has committed to extend the range of the validation for 
impurity F1 (see recommendation 3, section 2.2.6).  
The Applicant has committed to specify an analytical method for step yield determination and confirm its 
suitability for use (see recommendation 5, section 2.2.6). 
Further justification was requested for the decision to control Impurities A, B, F1 and F2 as “named” 
impurities (A, B, F1 & F2) in the active substance and for the proposal to control all other impurities as 
“unknown”. It was considered that the acceptance criteria for impurities should be justified on the basis of 
impurity levels that had been clinically qualified and a limit for “Total unknown impurities” should be set. In 
general, the applicant provided a justification for the proposed impurity limits and proposed a limit for total 
unknown impurities, however, some points for clarification remained. The applicant has now clarified the 
decision to control impurities F1 and F2 as “named” impurities and other impurities (present at the same 
level as F1 and F2) as “unknown” and this issue is considered resolved. Overall the proposed limits for 
product related impurities in the active substance are acceptable. However, the applicant has committed to 
review the specifications for impurity A after manufacture of additional batches and a similar 
recommendation is made in relation to impurities F1 & F2, individual unknown impurities and total unknown 
impurities (see recommendations 9 and 11, section 2.2.6).  
In addition the applicant has confirmed that a new method capable of improved resolution of main peak from 
named and unnamed impurities shall be developed for the purpose of quantifying product-related impurities 
and that this method will be registered in the dossier as a release method for both active substance and 
finished product (see recommendation 12, section 2.2.6). 
Batch analysis 
Batches from all four manufacturing processes were analyzed. All batches analyzed met the release 
acceptance criteria. 
Reference standards of materials 
The history of reference standards used during development has been presented. Preparation, release testing 
and stability for three of them are provided. 
The strategy for qualification and retesting of new internal reference standard was not described. The 
applicant has now provided the strategy and it is considered acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/351805/2017 
Page 21/104 
 
  
  
Stability 
The proposed shelf life for the active substance is 24 months at a storage condition of -20 ºC.  
Stability studies have been performed using three different storage conditions: -20±5 ºC (long term), -
70±10 ºC (which is stated to be a potential alternative storage condition) and 2-8 ºC (in-use stability).  
Additional queries were raised mainly in relation to trend analysis of impurities on stability and the stability 
indicating nature of the RP-HPLC method for control of purity. These issues were resolved during the 
procedure. 
Comparability exercise for Active Substance 
During the manufacturing process development, the cenegermin manufacturing process has undergone 
several changes including a series of manufacturing scale changes and transfer from the early development 
facility to the proposed manufacturing site at Dompé. The fundamental fed batch fermentation process was 
not significantly changed apart from scale although some modifications were made to media 
supplementation. The downstream purification process was modified between different versions of the 
manufacturing process to accommodate the increase in fermentation scale.  
Comparability is claimed primarily on the basis of release testing. Additional characterisation testing 
performed includes: N-terminal sequencing, amino acid composition and protein concentration, circular 
dichroism, intact molecular weight, free sulphydryls and analytical ultracentrifugation. The comparability 
exercise did not address process performance parameters or active substance stability profiles, however, this 
information will not be requested in the context of the manufacturing process changes introduced and on the 
grounds that accelerated stability data from historical batches is comparable to commercial batches. 
The approach taken to demonstrate comparability between different manufacturing processes is considered 
to be acceptable.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Oxervate finished product is a sterile preservative-free ophthalmic solution containing 20 µg/ml of 
cenegermin active substance.  
The finished product contains the following excipients: Trehalose dihydrate, Mannitol, Disodium hydrogen 
phosphate anhydrous, Sodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate, Hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose 
(Hypromellose), Polyethylene glycol 6000, L-Methionine, Hydrochloric acid, Sodium hydroxide, Nitrogen and 
Water for injections. 
It is confirmed that the intended commercial formulation is representative of that used during phase 2 clinical 
studies. 
The finished product is packaged in multi-dose siliconized glass class I vials closed with a rubber stopper and 
an aluminium seal with a polypropylene flip-off cap. Each vial contains 1.0 ml of solution. Seven multi-dose 
vials are packaged in a cardboard box with the leaflet. 
Assessment report  
EMA/351805/2017 
Page 22/104 
 
  
  
 
The product is intended to be administered with a kit of delivery system devices, including one vial adapter, 
disposable pipettes, and disinfectant wipes, which is not part of the finished product and is supplied 
separately to the Oxervate.  
For the pipette, sanitising wipes the EC certificate of Conformity (CE mark) confirming compliance with EC 
Directive 93/42/EEC Annex V have been provided. For the vial adapted a certificate has also been provided 
(Certificate number 346 CT issued by AMTAC Certification Services confirming compliance with Directive 
93/42/EEC Annex V).  
For administration of the product, the flip-off cap is removed from the vial and a vial-adapter is connected to 
the glass vial. The vial is then ready for use. To administer the product, a special pipette able to deliver the 
solution drops of 39 μl is attached to the vial adapter. The liquid transfer is secured by the pipette luer-lock 
system. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of the following main steps: compounding of excipient for buffer solution, 
filtration of the buffer solution, dispensing and pooling of the preliminary thawed cenegermin bulk active 
substance (BAS), dilution of cenegermin BAS with buffer solution, gentle wave-mixing of the bulk FP solution, 
filtration of the bulk FP solution and sterile filling/stoppering of vials, crimping of the vials and FP visual 
inspection. 
There is no design space or process-analytical technologies proposed. Being proteinaceous in nature, the 
product cannot be terminally sterilised. Therefore it is manufactured by aseptic processing and sterilised by 
sterile filtration through consecutive 0.2µm filters. Filter integrity is confirmed pre- and post-filtration and 
bioburden is adequately controlled prior to filtration. Compatibility studies on contact materials (i.e. filters, 
EVA bags) have been performed.   
Validation data have been provided on 3 commercial and 3 supportive batches at the final proposed batch 
size of 12.0 L and a vial fill volume of 1.0ml. The finished product batches were manufactured using three 
active substance batches (#0615, 0815 and 1015) which are representative of the commercial manufacturing 
process for active substance. The process validation included validation of the manufacturing process, hold 
times and times of refrigeration, media fills, sterile filtration and shipping. A number of issues had been 
raised in relation to the validation reports, in particular the filter validation reports. The Applicant has justified 
during the procedure, the low levels of extractables observed in terms of route of administration. The risks 
associated with ocular delivery of the finished product with quantified low levels of identified extractables are 
negligible as supported by non-clinical and clinical studies. 
The applicant had not provided adequate evidence of the control strategy for the manufacturing process, and 
proposed controls were not adequately justified. A more thorough discussion on the risk-evaluation used for 
assigning criticality was requested, including justification for selection of some control parameters as non-
critical versus critical. The response provided demonstrated an appropriate approach to selection of key 
parameters for the control of quality of finished product production. 
Product specification 
Specifications proposed for control of Oxervate finished product are in accordance with pharmacopoeial 
requirements and include visual appearance, pH, osmolality, identity, particulate contamination, assay, 
Assessment report

purity, impurities, potency, sterility and on shelf-life container integrity.  There was no limit proposed for 
total unknown impurities, extractable volume or viscosity. The applicant has proposed to introduce a USP-
based method to control for viscosity and has committed to validate this method as a post-authorisation 
commitment as a batch-release method (see recommendation 10, section 2.2.6). The applicant has further 
committed to registering a limit of NMT 2.5% for total unknown impurities in the drug product release 
specifications. The absence of a limit for extractable volume was justified on the basis of an overfill required 
for multiple doses. 
In addition, a specification for methionine antioxidant, total unknown impurities and viscosity at both release 
and shelf-life will be implemented post-marketing, which is acceptable. 
During the procedure changes to specifications were requested and the justification for finished product 
specifications was requested to be revised. In particular the Applicant was requested to describe the 
statistical basis for assigning acceptance criteria, where relevant. The Applicant has also committed to re-
evaluate the limits for potency and impurities within a post-marketing commitment, which has been 
considered acceptable.  
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) appropriately 
validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. 
The control of finished product was not considered sufficiently justified as the proposed quality control 
methods could not guarantee that a major deficiency in the quality of the product would not occur. 
Specifically, a major objection was raised in relation to the control of purity. The proposal to use a single 
purity method (RP-HPLC) was not endorsed without justification, particularly as the validation of the method 
for named impurities was inadequate. The response to these concerns was considered partially resolved but 
other concerns arose after its assessment. Thus, the applicant was requested to confirm linearity for the 
commercial formulation using this RP-HPLC method for identity, assay and purity, to provide a very clear 
table describing all the parameters which had been validated for the final proposed RP-HPLC method, to 
confirm that all system suitability parameters for the RP-HPLC method shall comply with Ph. Eur. 2.2.46 and 
to provide a validation report for the proposed commercial formulation of finished product. The above-
mentioned issues have been resolved and the applicant has committed to provide full validation of the 
method for individually named impurities as a post-authorization commitment (recommendation 11, section 
2.2.6). In addition, the applicant commits to continuing efforts to develop a more appropriate method for 
quantification of named impurities given the poor peak resolution demonstrated by this method. A new 
method capable of improved resolution of main peak from named and unnamed impurities shall be developed 
for the purpose of quantifying product-related impurities and that this method will be registered in the 
dossier as a release method for both drug substance and drug product (recommendation 12, section 2.2.6). 
The cell-based potency assay using a receptor is the same method as proposed for active substance (see 
above). 
The applicant has provided an adequate summary of the risk assessment for elemental impurities and the 
strategy to evaluate risk as for parenterals is endorsed. It is noted that method qualification is ongoing for 
the Cadmium analysis and the Applicant has committed to provide the results of the analysis of cadmium 
levels in the finished product including information on the qualification of the method (see recommendation 
13, section 2.2.6). 
Batch analysis 
Assessment report  
EMA/351805/2017 
Page 24/104 
 
  
  
Batch analysis data (12 batches at 12 L commercial scale) have been presented for the finished product. 
Acceptance limits have been set based on the Applicant’s own manufacturing experience.  
Now, both proposed limits for osmolality and potency have been clinically justified. In addition the applicant 
committed to submit a variation to tighten limits for potency if appropriate, following monitoring of the next 
10 commercial batches. 
Reference materials 
The same reference materials used in the Active Substance are used in the Finished Product. 
Stability of the product 
Stability and storage conditions 
The proposed shelf life for Oxervate is 2 years for the unopened vial at (-20 °C ±5 °C).  
At the pharmacy, the weekly carton containing the vials must be stored in a freezer (-20 °C ±5 °C). 
The patient will receive a weekly carton including 7 vials of OXERVATE in an insulated pack. As soon as the 
patient is at home (and no later than 5 hours from when the patient receives the product at the pharmacy), 
the weekly carton should be placed into the refrigerator, at 2-8 °C. It should be noted that the frozen 
medicinal product received from the pharmacy could need up to 30 minutes for thawing. 
As in-use shelf life, section 6.3 of the SPC details that once opened, the product must be stored below 25 °C 
and used within 12 hours at 25 °C.  
For use, an individual multi-dose vial of Oxervate is to be removed from the fridge for use over the course of 
a single day. Each opened vial can be stored in the fridge or below 25 °C, but must be used within 12 hours. 
After this period of time the vial contents should be discarded irrespective of whether some residual product 
remains in the vial. 
Stability data  
Stability for the finished product (24 month shelf-life at -20º ± 5ºC) has been carried out using clinical 
batches manufactured to pilot scale. These batches are considered to be representative of commercial 
batches as they differ only in filling volume (0.5 ml for clinical batches and 1.0 ml for industrial batches).  
Analytical methods applied were identical to those used for finished product release with the exception of 
Container Closure Integrity test, which has been described and validated. The method (determination of 
maximum absorption using a UV-Vis spectrum between 200 and 700 nm of a solution of methylene blue) has 
been validated for linearity, repeatability, LOD, LOQ, range, determination of maximum absorption. Methods 
used were considered to be stability indicating. 
Date were provided for real-time (-20ºC), accelerated, forced and in-use studies. 
Parameters such as pH, potency, osmolality, concentration, impurities and sterility remained well within 
shelf-life specifications over the 24 months for which data has been provided.  
The assigned in-use shelf life of 7 days at 2-8ºC for unopened vials is supported by a stability study 
consisting of three process validation batches at commercial scale, which were stored initially at 25ºC for 5

hours (to represent transport from point of dispensing to the patients home) followed by 14 days at 2-8ºC 
and a further 12 hours at 25ºC.  
Vial integrity testing has been performed on the adaptor in situ with multiple product withdrawals over a 12-
hour period. 
During the procedure a question was raised on the minimum thaw time that is required for a vial, as this was 
not registered in the dossier or the product information. The applicant provided the requested supporting 
data and updated the product information to include this information and the issue was resolved.  
Adventitious agents 
The adventitious agent safety evaluation is supported.  
The production cell line, E.coli does not harbour mammalian viruses. There is suitable control of raw and 
starting materials, including characterisation of the cell bank. The phage study presented supports the claim 
that the cell banks do not contain any adventitious phage or pro phage.  
No materials of animal or human origin are used in the manufacturing process.  The production process 
contains filtration steps to reduce any potential contamination and also includes in-process controls and 
release tests for bioburden. The AS and FP manufacturers have GMP-certified hygiene measures in place. 
In conclusion, the CHMP considers that the safety of the product quality in relation to adventitious agents 
including viral and TSE safety is adequate. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
From the quality point of view the CHMP considered the quality dossier at submission, to be poorly presented 
and incomplete with respect to critical data to support a sufficient knowledge of active substance and an 
appropriate control strategy for both manufacturing process and active substance. This was reflected in the 
two major objections that were raised during the procedure namely (1) on the proposed manufacturing 
process control strategy which was considered insufficient to ensure consistent quality of the active substance 
and (2) on insufficient characterisation of the active substance and routine control of impurities for active 
substance/finished product.  
The major objections are interlinked as the insufficient characterisation of active substance impacts upon 
defining appropriate CQAs and upon the comparability studies carried out across the different historical 
versions of the manufacturing process. In addition, numerous inconsistencies and omissions were noted in 
the data presented which has been reflected in the number of other concerns raised throughout the 
procedure 
The first major objections related to the proposed manufacturing process control strategy which was 
considered to lack transparency and which was not sufficient to ensure consistent quality of the active 
substance. Further information was requested in order to justify the CQAs and provide a clear rationale for 
those used to establish CPPs and IPCs. The classification of process parameters and IPCs as critical or non-
critical was not transparent and further justification was requested. It was not clear how acceptance criteria 
were selected for the CPPs and IPCs defined for the manufacturing process and clarification was requested. 
Where the control strategy has been developed using data from a previous manufacturing process (edge of 
Assessment report  
EMA/351805/2017 
Page 26/104 
 
  
  
range/development studies, historical batch data), this was requested to be justified in the context of 
comparability to the proposed commercial process.  
Linked to this major objection was also a concern related to insufficient demonstration of comparability 
between commercial batches and batches used during clinical trials. The batches used during clinical trials 
were mostly manufactured according to historical processes although a single Phase II clinical trial was 
carried out with a batch manufactured according to the commercial process. A more thorough 
characterisation study was requested to support the claim that batches manufactured according to previous 
manufacturing process are representative of batches manufactured according to the proposed commercial 
process. Specifically, further information was sought on the purity profile, functional characterisation, post 
translational modification and secondary/tertiary structure of the active substance. Furthermore, process 
performance data and active substance stability profile were requested to be addressed as part of the 
comparability exercise. 
A second major objection was raised in relation to control of active substance which was not considered to be 
sufficiently justified. The proposed RP-HPLC method, as the sole method for the detection of impurities was 
not considered adequate to control the quality of the product. Questions were raised in relation to the 
suitability and validation of the method. Furthermore, the Applicant was requested to identify additional 
impurity methods and to provide further information on the purity profile, functional characterisation, protein 
modifications and secondary/tertiary structure of the active substance.   
During the procedure the Applicant provided the information requested. Relevant monitored process 
parameters (MPPs) or in-process monitoring (IPM), while not considered critical by the applicant, were 
registered in the dossier as part of the control strategy. In relation to the proposed acceptance criteria, data 
was provided to support the target ranges for process parameters and in-process controls examined during 
the process validation studies. The developmental and edge of range studies used to set these target ranges 
were provided. Where historical batch data was combined with process validation (PV) batch data to set 
acceptance criteria for IPCs, information was supported with results from historical batches in question. The 
strategy for defining acceptance criteria for process parameters and IPCs was justified with reference to any 
statistical evaluation of data, where relevant. 
During the procedure the Applicant was able to resolve the concerns and to demonstrate the suitability of the 
purity methods SE-HPLC and SDS-PAGE.  
During the procedure there were also questions raised on the delivery kit, which includes one vial adapter, 
disposable pipettes, and disinfectant wipes, to be provided separately to the product. The delivery kit is not 
part of the finished product presentation. This proposal to supply the delivery kit separately to the product 
was considered justified with reference to the different storage conditions necessary for the delivery kit 
(between 2-8° C) and the finished product vial presentation (at – 20° C).  
The suitability of the delivery system with regard to the risk to the patient from potential contamination of 
the vial adapter surface was demonstrated. The applicant confirmed that the microbial integrity of the 
product can be maintained under normal conditions of use including cleaning of the adaptor with disinfectant 
wipes prior to each withdrawal. In addition, the applicant has committed to continue to monitor reports 
related to the device during ongoing clinical studies and pharmacovigilance reporting and to continue efforts 
to develop the device further (see recommendation 14, section 2.2.6).  
During the procedure the major objections and other concerns were resolved by the Applicant.

Although sufficient data to support marketing authorisation have now been provided, a number of 
recommendations will be addressed post-marketing in the context of further quality development of this 
product (see section 2.2.6). 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

(Timeline: to be submitted with the closing sequence i.e. within 15 days after the marketing authorisation) 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
To support the present application, the applicant conducted a number of non-clinical studies including both in 
vitro and in vivo (rat and rabbit) primary pharmacodynamic (PD) studies investigate receptor binding, signal 
transduction and proliferation of neuronal and corneal epithelial cells as well as to compare effects of multiple 
routes of administration and explore adequate dosage on inducing healing and reparation in animal disease 
models. A safety pharmacology study was performed in the rat for examination of CNS effects. 
Absorption, distribution and toxicokinetics of rhNGF were investigated in the same animal species used in the 
toxicology safety studies (rat and rabbit). Toxicological studies included single and repeat dose studies with 
administration via local (in the eye) and systemic routes. 
Rat and rabbit were identified by the applicant as relevant rodent and non-rodent species (respectively) for 
the toxicology studies because both express the NGF receptors in the ocular structures. Furthermore, rat is 
the rodent species of choice for investigating biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals, particularly when they 
express the ligand-specific receptor. The rabbit is well known as suitable species for ophthalmic investigation 
as well as for reprotoxicity and developmental studies. The rabbit express the NGF receptors as do all

mammals and it responds to rhNGF pharmacological activity (You et al, 2000). 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
NGF is a neurotrophic factor important for the differentiation, regeneration and the survival of sympathetic 
and sensory neurons in humans and other vertebrae. NGF binds to high affinity neurotrophic tropomyosin 
receptor kinase A (TrkA) and the low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor p75. Although expression of TrkA 
alone is sufficient for cellular responses, p75 can regulate TrkA-ligand interactions and signal transductions. 
In the presence of p75, NGF binding affinity to TrkA is increased (Maliartchouk & Saragovi, 1997; Godfrey & 
Shooter, 1986). 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
 
In vitro studies 
In vitro studies were performed in a range of cell lines which included Statens Seruminstitut Rabbit Cornea 
(SIRC) cells, Human erythroleukaemia (TF-1) cells, Pheochromocytoma rat cells (PC12) cells, neuroblastoma 
cells (SH-SY5Y), human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK293), and rabbit ocular epithelial cell cultures. 
Studies in SIRC cells compared cell proliferation in the presence of rhNGF and mNGF. The test showed no 
activity of rhNGF at the tested concentration ranges [0.3 pM (7.96 pg/ml) to 6.76 nmol (179.29 ng.ml) and 
0.7 pM (18.57 pg/ml) to 13.52 nmol (358.58 ng/ml)] in contrast to mNGF which induced increased cell 
proliferation (30% increase) at very high concentrations of 6760pM and 13520pM.  
Activity of rhNGF and mNGF was also tested at a range of concentrations in rat PC12-Luci cells, which are 
known to express high affinity TrkA receptors and low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor p75. The study 
also included a commercially available rhNGF (SigmaAldrich) as a comparator. The PC12-Luci cell line is 
stably transfected with human c-fos promoter driving a luciferase reporter gene. NGF receptor activation 
results in c-fos mRNA and protein expression and can be measured using a luciferase assay. The assay 
results were indicative of a dose-dependent increase in luminiscence (EC50 of 1.4 ng/ml for rhNGF produced 
by the applicant) reflecting TrkA receptor activation. Commercially available rhNGF displayed higher levels of 
luminescence in this assay when compared to the rhNGF produced by the applicant and subject to this 
application. The role of rhNGF in neuronal differentiation and spreading was also assessed in PC12 cells. A 
range of concentrations were tested using mNGF and a MimD3 as comparators. Outgrowth in neurites was 
observed from concentrations of 25 ng/mL for rhNGF while activity for mNGF started at much higher 
concentrations (50 μg/mL). No effect of MimD3 was observed.  
The responsiveness of rabbit corneal epithelial cells to rhNGF and mNGF was tested in fresh prepared cell 
samples. Both incubation with rhNGF and mNGF, studied at various concentrations ranging from 100 pM to 
1.02 μM, resulted in an increase of cell clonogenicity and also colony size. TrkA expression was found to be 
induced in these cell cultures in a dose dependent manner. 
Finally, a study testing iodinated rhNGF for binding activity in solubilised rabbit corneas revealed a 
dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.24 nmol which was similar to that seen in a study by Banerjee et al. (1976), 
in which Kd for 125I mNGF was determined at about 0.2 nmol.  
Studies using human biomaterial are summarised in more detail in section 2.4.2. of this report. Three assays 
were conducted. The affinity of rhNGF and mNGF for the human TrkA receptor was studied in HEK 293 cells 
showing higher affinity of rhNGF compared to mNGF. Furthermore, a proliferation assay with TF-1 cells 
Assessment report  
EMA/351805/2017 
Page 30/104 
 
  
  
showed that rhNGF was approximately 10 time more active compared to mNGF in inducing cell proliferation. 
Finally, biological activity of NGF was tested using the neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y. Briefly, the assay 
showed biologic activity and no cytotoxicity for both rhNGF and all comparators (mNGF and MimD3).  
 
In vivo studies 
The effect of NGF was also studied in vivo in a number of rat models as well as in rabbits. 
The effect of rhNGF in the rat superior cervical ganglia hypertrophy test was studied in comparison to mNGF. 
Superior cervical ganglia is a very sensitive tissue to NGF action, and even more in pre-and postnatal 
development, therefore neonatal male Sprague Dawley rat pups were used. Both treatment with rhNGF and 
mNGF at doses of 1, 10 and 20 µg resulted in dose-dependent increases of superior cervical ganglia weight. 
No differences were discernible between both products, suggesting a similar pharmacological effect.  
The potential therapeutic effect of ocular eye drop rhNGF administration was assessed in the rat Royal 
College of Surgeons (RCS) model of retinitis pigmentosa. Both eye drop and intravitreal dosing were studied. 
Results suggest that rhNGF dosing in rats results in the protection of photoreceptor degeneration. Ocular 
administration reduced apoptosis and augmented TrkA expression. Furthermore, reduction of Caspase 2 and 
9 levels, two apoptotic markers, was observed, supporting a potential efficacy in protection of 
photoreceptors. Similar results were obtained irrespective of the route of administration. The largest effects 
were seen at the highest concentration which was 200 μg/ml, dosed 3 times per day for 20 days. RCS rats 
were furthermore used to assess the optimal dose regimen. In animals dosed with the highest concentration 
of rhNGF at 180 μg/ml 3 times a day during 3 days the highest level of a protective effect was observed. This 
is in contrast to single or twice a day (BID) administration that did not result in discernible effects.  
In the Partial Optic Nerve Transection (pONT) model, 21 days of administration of rhNGF at various doses 
resulted in increased retinal ganglion cells (RGC) survival and decrease of secondary RGC degeneration at 
concentrations ≥60 μg/mL.  
Conjuntival Goblet Cells (CGC) express NGF receptors, which increase mucin secretion when stimulated. 
When rats were administered eye drops of rhNGF, a dose related increase in mucin production (MUC5aC) 
occurred. Effects were seen at doses of 10-20 μg/ml, 3 or 6 times/day. 
In a rabbit model after photorefractive keratomy, animals received mNGF in the right eye and balanced salt 
solution in the other eye. The data did not result in significant differences between active and control. A re-
analysis of the data suggested that at all time points mNGF accelerated corneal healing, in comparison to 
placebo. The evidence shown in this study was however very weak. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacology studies have been performed. This has been justified on the basis that rhNGF 
binds only the TrkA and p75 receptors and in addition the ocular administration results in very low systemic 
exposure to NGF.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
An Irwin safety pharmacology study was carried out to assess potential effects of NGF on the CNS. No effects 
were reported in this study. Considering the route of administration, cardiac, renal and respiratory safety 
pharmacology studies were not deemed appropriate. This was confirmed in a CHMP Scientific Advice.  
Assessment report  
EMA/351805/2017 
Page 31/104 
 
  
  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Systemic exposure is considered negligible, and unlikely to result in relevant pharmacodynamic drug 
interactions. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption and toxicokinetics were addressed in a single and repeated dose studies carried out in rats and 
rabbits. Animals were dosed intravenously (IV) or by topical route (eye drops) in single dose studies while in 
repeated dose studies animals were dosed via topical route (eye drops) or subcutaneous (SC) route. 
An Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) was used to quantify the levels of rhNGF levels in rat and 
rabbit serum with an appropriate dynamic range of 8-2000 pg/ml. The assay was considered adequately 
validated, meeting the criteria of selectivity as outlined in the Guideline on Bioanalytical Method Validation 
(ICH EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009), with the potential of only minor interference by endogenous NGF in 
rat and rabbit serum.  
Topical (ocular) single dose administration in rats produced highly variable toxicokinetic results. One study 
was conducted specifically to assess systemic absorption of rhNGF following ocular administration of 0.8 
mg/mL to intact and abraded corneas in rats. In rats with intact corneas, serum concentrations at both time 
points were all below the limit of quantification (8 pg/mL) (with the exception of one animal with a serum 
concentration of 28.5 pg/mL at 6 hours). In rats with abraded corneas, levels of rhNGF varied from a 
minimum of 54.4 pg/mL to a maximum of 772.1 pg/mL. A mechanistic toxicokinetic study in the rat showed 
an about 100 times higher exposure in the sublingual vein compared to tail vein sampling after ocular rhNGF 
administration supporting absorption of rhNGF from the oral cavity after passage through the nasolacrymal 
duct. IV administration in the same species was assessed at increasing doses up to 1.2 mg/ml. In male rats, 
rhNGF exposure showed a tendency to augment in a dose-proportional manner while in females, exposure 
was greater than dose proportionate. The terminal half-life ranged from 3 to 4 hours and clearance and 
volume distribution were high. Exposure was generally comparable in both sexes and no significant 
differences were observed.  
In rabbits, data after IV single dose administration was indicative of a biphasic profile. In this species, 
differences in exposure among sexes were seen, which increased in a more than dose proportionate manner 
in the males and less than dose proportional in females in the high dose range (1.2-2.4 mg/kg). The terminal 
half-life ranged from 4 to 6 hours and clearance and volume distribution were high. Ocular administration in 
rabbits resulted in low and very variable exposure to rhNGF. 
In a 4 week repeated dose study rats were dosed rhNGF up to 1.2mg/kg (3 times a day). Animals were 
sampled sublingually and therefore the exposure levels are most likely overestimated. No antibodies against 
the product were reported and no gender differences. Exposure in males was more than dose proportional 
and dose proportional in females. In a 25 weeks in rats (up to 1.2 mg/ml, 3 times a day) also using 
sublingual sampling resulting in the same drawbacks, some animals (three males) displayed antibodies 
against rhNGF. SC administration was assessed in a rat study of 26 weeks duration in which animals were 
dosed of 50 and 100 μg/animal/day. Exposure was very variable at the low dose. No significant differences 
were observed between sexes. Only one animal displayed anti-drug antibodies (ADA) at the low dose and half 
of them (3/6) at 100 μg/animal/day.  
In a 4-week rabbit study, animals were treated by eye drops at dose concentrations of 0.6, 0.8 and 1.2 
mg/mL (each rabbit received 30 l in both eyes, three times a day) and blood sampling was done from the ear

Page 32/104 
 
  
  
vein. Inter-individual variability in plasma exposure was very high and no exposure dose-relationship could 
be determined. At many sampling times, rhNGF was below the limits of quantification. Binding antibodies at 
the end treatment were present in the majority of the animals but this did not significantly affect the mean 
levels of rhNGF plasma exposure. Rabbits were also treated with rhNGF by eye drops for 2-months (0.6 and 
1.2 mg/mL, 30 l three times daily). Blood sampling from the central ear artery showed that systemic 
exposure to rhNGF was minimal and without a dose-response relationship. On week 4, binding antibodies 
against rhNGF were found in 50% of animals treated with the lowest dose and in 90% of animals treated at 
the highest dose, and on week 8 binding antibodies were found in 100% of animals treated with the lowest 
dose and in 90% of animals treated at the highest dose. SC administration of rhNGF up to 200 μg/animal/day 
to rabbits resulted in highly variable rhNGF levels after 90 days of daily SC administration. Half of the animals 
displayed ADAs against the product at the low dose and 12/14 animals at 200 μg/animal/day which may 
have contributed to the variability seen in exposure data. 
The effect of addition of L-methionine was assessed in a 14-day and 2-month repeated dose studies carried 
out in rabbits. In the 14-day study all but one animal had serum levels of rhNGF below the limit of 
quantification and antibodies against the product were seen in a limited number of animals. When the clinical 
formulation was assessed for 2 months (1.2 mg/ml with and without L-methionine), there was again high 
variability in exposure measurements of rhNGF and a high number of animals displayed levels below the limit 
of quantification. ADAs against rhNGF were found in all animals by the end of the study.  
Reprotoxicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits with SC administration and included toxicokinetics 
and immunogenicity investigations. In the fertility and embryo-foetal development study in rats, exposure to 
rhNGF increased in a dose-proportional manner. Cmax values were reached 2 hours after administration. 
Only one animal in each rhNGF-treated group developed binding antibodies in this study. 
In pre- and postnatal development study in rats, the F0 (parental) generation showed rhNGF levels 2 hours 
after administration, whereas no rhNGF levels were detectable in the F1 (first filial) generation pubs. 
Regarding immunogenicity, 45-65% of the animals from the F0 generation and 55-78% of the F1 generation 
were positive for anti-rhNGF antibodies. Thus there was a transfer of anti-rhNGF antibodies from mother to 
the F1 generation.  
In embryo-foetal development studies in rabbits, Cmax was reached at 2-4 h post-dose from gestation day 7 
to 20. Accumulation of rhNGF was observed. Administration of rhNGF resulted in an immunogenic reaction in 
some animals but it did not affect exposure to rhNGF.  
Distribution was assessed in albino rats after topical (eye drop) administration of [3H]-rhNGF 6 times at 
2 hours intervals. Animals were administered 0.25 or 1.0 μg/eye/dose. Radioactivity was measured at all 
dose levels and no gender differences were found when adjustments including animal weight were 
introduced. The highest levels of radioactivity were reported in serum, urine, kidney, liver, uveal tract and 
retina and contents of the gastrointestinal tract. Gastrointestinal re-absorption after distribution of the 
product in the nasolacrymal and nasopharyngeal ducts affected the final outcome of overall exposure. The 
half-life at 0.25 μg/eye/dose was 77.1 and 67.5 hours in males and females, respectively, and at 
1.0 μg/eye/dose half-lives were 57.6 and 68.5 hours, respectively. Elimination was faster from serum than 
from tissues although all measurements were below the limit of quantification at the final sampling time 
(24 hours). The eye surface displayed higher levels of radioactivity than internal region of the eye. 
Differences were more evident at the low dose tested showing radioactivity in the cornea, lens and sclera. 
Higher levels of radioactivity were measured at 1.0 μg/eye/dose of [3H]-rhNGF where radioactivity was also 
present in the optic nerve, iris, ciliary body, retina and choroid although at lower levels than in the sclera and

cornea. Very low levels of radioactivity were reported in the brain and spinal cord. Serum tissue relationship 
was the lowest reported among all organs and only at the highest dose tested. 
No measurements were made of plasma protein binding, placental transfer or milk excretion. 
Furthermore, no specific metabolism studies were conducted. As a protein, rhNGF is catabolised by standard 
proteolytic pathways with its constituent amino acids being added to the general body pool. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single and repeat dose toxicity 
Dose escalation studies (single dose) in rats and rabbits with ocular, IV and SC administration showed that 
rhNGF is well tolerated at all tested doses. 
Repeat-dose toxicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits via ocular and SC administration for up to 
26 weeks in rats and 90 days in rabbits.  
When rhNGF was administered as eye drops up to the dose of 1.2 mg/mL no treatment-related changes were 
observed in the eyes or systemically. In a 2-month study in rabbits, eyes were also investigated with 
electroretinography, ocular tonometry and slit lamp, without observing any differences in rhNGF treatment 
animals compared to the control group. No effects were observed in the nervous tissue (including optic 
nerve) or brain in any species. 
Only in the 4-week rat study slightly dose-dependent increased glucose, chloride and phosphorous 
concentration were observed in both sexes, and sodium concentration was increased in females after ocular 
administration of rhNGF. These changes were reversible. As these changes were not observed in the 26-week 
study in rats, they may be attributable to biological variation.  
Studies in rabbits of up to 2 months of daily ocular administration with the formulation intended for 
marketing but with a 100-fold higher amount of L-methionine did not show any adverse effect. 
In the SC studies in rats, leucocyte and lymphocyte increases that correlated with an increased inflammatory 
mixed cells infiltration at the injection site were observed in males. Slighty increased phosphorous 
concentration in blood had no morphological correlate in any organ or function. In addition, signs were 
observed in the rhNGF treated groups such as local swelling of legs, paws, cheeks, nose and tail, and 
erythema on the ears and tail indicative of immunogenic reaction to the test item.  
In the rabbit SC study, effects were seen in the ovaries of females including increase weight proliferation and 
haemorrhagic cysts in the highest dose group of 200 µg/animal.  
The Applicant conducted a comparative study with two rhNGF formulations (with and without chlorobutanol) 
in rats with intact or abraded cornea. Chlorobutanol was present in some formulations used in no-clinical 
toxicology studies but is not included in the clinical formulation. Both formulations were well tolerated.  
Genotoxicity 
No genotoxicity studies have been conducted since NGF is a protein and thus not expected to interact directly 
with DNA. 
Assessment report  
EMA/351805/2017 
Page 34/104 
 
  
  
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies were performed.  
Reproduction Toxicity 
Reprotoxicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits after SC administration of rhNGF. No effects were 
observed on male or female fertility in rats, embryo-foetal development in pregnant rats or rabbits or pre- 
and postnatal development in rats at the highest doses tested (150 µg/animal/day). Parental clinical signs 
were similar to the findings in the SC general toxicity studies in rats and rabbits. Despite the presence of 
anti-rhNGF antibodies, adequate exposure to the test item was obtained in all studies. 
Although there are some deviations from the reprotoxicity studies design recommended in guideline ICH 
S5(R2), such as the lack of an embryo-foetal development study in another species in addition to rabbits 
(rat) or that males in the fertility study started treatment 2 weeks before mating (4 weeks is recommended), 
considering the good safety profile of rhNGF in general and reproductive toxicity studies and the fact that 
exposure in patients is negligible, no additional reproductive toxicity studies were considered necessary.  
Toxicokinetic data 
See section 2.3.3.  
Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance was assessed as part of the ocular administration studies in rats and rabbits. 
Other toxicity studies 
Immunogenicity was assessed as part of the repeat dose studies (see also section 2.3.3. ). No sign of 
animmunotoxic potential of rhNGF according to ICH guideline S8 was observed.  
rhNGF formulations containing up to 1 mg/ml of L-methionine (100 fold the concentration of the formulation 
proposed for commercial use) were tested in rabbits for up to 2 months. No effects on body weight, clinical 
observations or ophthalmic examinations were observed. In terms of immunogenicity, the profile did not 
seem to differ from a similar study performed without L-methionine.  
The specifications for the drug-product impurities were above the ICH Q3B threshold for qualification and 
therefore require toxicological justification. Levels of Impurities A, B, F1 and F2 have been present in batches 
used in the repeat dose toxicity studies at levels close to the proposed levels. Furthermore, the absolute 
amount of these impurities to which animals were exposed during the repeat dose toxicity studies exceeded 
the amount by which they will be exposed to clinically at the specification limit proposed. Therefore, the 
specification levels proposed are sufficiently justified.

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment (ERA) 
In line with the Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use 
(CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2), since rhNGF is a peptide and unlikely to result in a significant risk to the 
environment, there is no need for ERA studies. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
The primary pharmacology data presented with this application clearly showed that rhNGF manufactured by 
the applicant binds to the TrkA receptor with high affinity. However, no information has been provided in 
relation to the affinity for the p75 receptor. The applicant indicated that PC12 cells of rat origin express both 
TrkA and p75 receptors and that two studies in PC12 cells have been conducted showing PD activity of 
rhNGF. While it was not entirely clear how the studies in PC12 cells would support binding to both TrkA and 
p75 receptors, the CHMP acknowledged that it was well documented in the scientific literature that both TrkA 
and p75 are expressed in the eye and that binding of rhNGF to the p75 receptor increases binding of NGF to 
TrkA. Taking into account that the rhNGF doses proposed for clinical use are quite low, the known higher 
affinity for TrkA compared to p75 and the clinical efficacy data (see section 2.5. ), absence of data showing a 
direct binding effect at the p75 receptor can be accepted. 
Furthermore, the initial dataset provided in support of this application did not inform on the relative binding 
of rhNGF to TrkA of rat and rabbit origin compared to human TrkA. The applicant was not able to present 
data directly comparing the binding affinity of rhNGF to TrkA of rat, rabbit and human origin. Instead 
reference was made to the ability of rhNGF to induce pharmacological activity in the various species and in 
some instances in comparison to the endogenously expressed NGF of that species. In this regard published 
data by Ibanez et al. (1991) provides evidence that both the rat and human NGF have comparable activity in 
rat PC12 cells. Furthermore, Altar et al. (2001) provide some evidence that binding of rhNGF in rat and rabbit 
brain was similar. Finally, a new study was conducted in which iodinated rhNGF was tested for binding 
activity in solubilised rabbit corneas. The results suggest a similar binding affinity between murine NGF and 
rhNGF binding to rabbit TrkA. In the context of these data and despite the lack of a direct quantitative 
comparison of rhNGF binding to TrkA of rat, rabbit and human origin, it is agreed that rhNGF is likely to have 
comparable pharmacological activity at the aforementioned tissues. 
Overall, both the in vitro and in vivo pharmacology studies performed provided evidence for pharmacological 
activity of rhNGF in cells of human, rat and rabbit origin as well as in several animal models. However, in any 
event, the final evaluation of efficacy will need to rely on the clinical data. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The absorption profile of the rhNGF in both rats and rabbits has been measured by toxicokinetics studies as 
part of the toxicology studies. In the absence of a suitable in vivo model of neurotrophic keratitis, this was 
considered acceptable. In most instances, following administration of rhNGF eye drops, a high interindividual 
variability of plasma exposure levels was observed. An unexpectedly high systemic exposure was seen in 
rats, which was attributed to passage of the rhNGF through the naso-lacrymal and nasopharyngeal ducts into 
the oral cavity where it was, at least in part, absorbed through the sublingual vein. Of note, systemic 
exposure levels were markedly increased in rats where the cornea was abraded when compared to those with 
intact cornea where levels were mostly below the level of detection.  
Assessment report  
EMA/351805/2017 
Page 36/104 
 
  
  
Distribution of rhNGF was assessed in rats and showed presence of rhNGF in the serum, urine, kidney, liver, 
uveal tract/retina and the gastrointestinal tract after topical administration. From a therapeutic perspective 
relevant was the presence of rhNGF in the cornea and sclera as well as in the optic nerve and retina after 
administration of 1.0 μg/eye/dose.  
Toxicology 
The species used in the toxicology studies were rat and rabbit. Non-clinical pharmacology studies have shown 
that these species are relevant and rhNGF receptors are expressed in many tissues including eyes of all 
mammals. In addition the rabbit is particularly adequate for ocular toxicity and embryo-foetal development 
investigation. However, as already outlined above in relation to the pharmacology studies, although there is 
some evidence of pharmacological activity of rhNGF in rabbits, questions remained in this regards as well as 
in relation to the relative activity of rhNGF in the species of choice as compared to humans with the potential 
for masking of toxicities due to difference in binding between species.  
The assessment of the activity of rhNGF in rabbits was impeded by the findings of lack of activity in a 
proliferation assay performed in rabbit SIRC cells. The CHMP acknowledged that SIRC cells are of fibroblastic 
origin and do not express TrkA (Fabricant et al., 1977), which would explain the lack of induction of cell 
proliferation by rhNGF. However, at the same time it was noted that Fabricant et al. showed very little 
binding of a 125I radiolabelled mNGF, and mNGF actually induced SIRC cell proliferation in the present assay. 
The applicant argued that the mNGF extract used in the assay may have contained additional growth factors 
and that the observed positive response at high doses was unspecific and not related to NGF. The CHMP 
considered the explanation acceptable. 
Only very limited additional support for biological activity of rhNGF in rabbits was derived from the scientific 
literature (see above). A new study using iodinated rhNGF and solubilised rabbit corneas revealed a 
dissociation constant (Kd) lower than in another study with human embryonic kidney cells (HEK). However, 
given the differences in the experimental set-ups of the two studies, it was agreed that rhNGF is likely to 
have similar pharmacological activity in rabbit cells as compared to human cells. In any event, given that the 
concentration of rhNGF used in toxicology studies is significantly higher than that proposed for the clinical 
setting, it was accepted that any differences in pharmacological activity should thereby be accounted for. 
When administered in the form of eye drops in rats and rabbits, rhNGF was generally well tolerated. Repeat-
dose toxicity studies with rhNGF eye drops concentrations up to 1.2 mg/mL no treatment-related changes 
were observed in the eyes or systemically. Some clinical signs occured after SC administration of rhNGF, but 
all these findings were mild and reversible. 
In the rabbit SC study, effects were seen in the ovaries of females including increased weight proliferation 
and haemorrhagic cysts in the highest dose group of 200 µg/animal. These might result from the 
pharmacological activity of rhNGF as NGF receptors are present in the ovaries of mammals. However, a toxic 
effect could not be excluded. Given that rhNGF is administered locally to patients at low doses with low or no 
systemic exposure, and in light of the significant margin of safety, the CHMP did not further pursue the issue. 
No sign of an immunotoxic potential of rhNGF was observed. Limited immunogenicity was observed in rats 
after topical administration of rhNGF. In rabbits, rhNGF was considerably more immunogenic with the 
presence of binding antibodies found in most animals after repeated dosing for 8 weeks. The presence of 
anti-rhNGF antibodies in most animal studies was expected as the animals were exposed to a heterologous 
protein and this response has no clinical or safety implications for humans.

The effect of the addition of L-methionine to the formulation was investigated both in terms of absorption of 
rhNGF and local and systemic tolerability. No significant differences in local tolerability, systemic exposure or 
immunogenic potential were seen in rabbits treated with a formulation without L-methionine or with a 100-
fold higher amount of L-methionine than intended for marketing. Furthermore, scientific literature data 
supported low toxicity and good tolerability of L-methionine both ingested and applied locally on skin or eyes. 
For example, an eye irritation study in New Zealand rabbits using a dose of 0.1 g of the additive in the 
conjunctival sac showed no adverse effects in the eyes of the animals, resulting in the classification of the 
product is classified as non-irritant to the eye [EFSA 2013]. 
As per ICH S6(R1) guidance, standard carcinogenicity studies are generally inappropriate for biotechnology 
derived produced, however, the guideline does make reference to studies being potentially required 
depending on the biological activity of the product with specific reference made to growth factors. NGF is a 
growth factor with proliferative effects and may play a role in tumourigenesis. The applicant referred to 
repeat dose studies in animals, in which rhNGF was administered systemically for up to 6 months. In these 
studies, there was no evidence indicative of proliferative changes in any organs examined. Although the 
duration of the studies was only 6 months, the CHMP agreed that it was unlikely that rhNGF could contribute 
to tumour initiation or promotion given the topic route of administration and at the dose levels proposed for 
use in clinical practice. Nevertheless, it was considered advisable not to use rhNGF eye drops in patients with 
eye tumours, and a related warning was included in SmPC section 4.4. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the CHMP was of the view that the non-clinical data presented by the applicant were adequate to 
support the application for Oxervate eye drops in the treatment of moderate or severe NK in adults. The 
available data supported pharmacological activity of rhNGF through binding to the TrkA receptor, as well as 
good tolerability and limited systemic exposure after ocular administration, the latter being mainly the result 
of absorption from the oral cavity after passage of the eyes drops through the nasolacrimal duct. Absence of 
certain types of studies including secondary PD studies, cardiac, renal and respiratory safety pharmacology 
studies, drug-drug interaction and metabolism studies, genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity studies were 
considered acceptable. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
To support the present application, the applicant provided the results of one Phase I study (NGF0112) in 
healthy male and female volunteers, two randomized, vehicle-controlled, double-masked Phase II studies 
(NGF0212 and NGF0214) in NK patients, whereby study NGF0212 consisted of two segments (Phase I and 
Phase II) which were analysed separately. Data from two additional studies in other conditions (moderate-
severe dry eye disease and retinitis pigmentosa) were also provided to support the safety database.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The Pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of Oxervate has been evaluated in two clinical studies including both healthy 
volunteers (study NGF0112) and NK patients (study NGF0212), as well as in three studies using human 
biomaterials. Immunogenicity was also assessed in these studies, as well as in the pivotal study NGF0214 
and study NGF0113 in patients with retinitis pigmentosa.

Absorption  
The primary aim of the PK evaluation was to assess the potential of systemic absorption of rhNGF after ocular 
instillation. 
A total of 74 healthy volunteers in study NGF0112 received fractionated single and multiple doses of rhNGF 
(up to 18.9 µg/day [6.3 µg three times a day] up to 5 days) or vehicle control. A total of 64 subjects were 
considered for the PK evaluation; these were those participating in part A and B of the study receiving either 
1 eye drop 3 times during 1 treatment day (part A), or 1 eye drop 3 times a day for 5 days (part B). Serial 
blood samples were collected pre-dose and after dosing with the rhNGF eye drops (at screening, during the 
study and at follow-up (Day 10 +/- 2 for Part A and Day 15 +/- 2 for Part B). 
Study NGF0212 consisted of 2 phases. The Phase I segment was conducted primarily for the assessment of 
PK parameters and included 18 patients who were randomised to receive either rhNGF 10µg/ml (7 patients), 
rhNGF 20 µg/ml (7 patients) or vehicle (4 patients). The respective rhNGF doses were 2.1 µg (10 µg/ml) or 
4.2 µg (20 µg/ml). During this Phase of the study, blood samples for PK profiling were collected at multiple 
time points from Day 1 through to the end of the 8-week controlled treatment period: on Days 1 and 55 (at 
0.5 hours pre-dose, and at 0.5, 1, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 4.5, 5, 6, 6.5, 7, and 8 hours post-dose), on Days 2 and 8 (at 
0.5 hours pre-dose, and at 0.5, 1, and 2 hours post-dose), and at Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 (pre-initial daily 
dose). During the Phase II segment of the study, which was the main phase for the efficacy assessment, 
patients were randomised to the same three treatment groups and sparse PK blood sampling was conducted 
during the 8 week controlled treatment period for the first 50 patients recruited only: Baseline (pre-
treatment) serum samples on Day 0 and at Weeks 1, 3, 6, and 8 (pre-initial daily dose). 
A validated ELISA assay was used for PK measurements. 
The majority of the subjects (both healthy volunteers and patients) had serum levels of NGF below the limit 
of quantification (< 32.000 pg/ml). Only 6 out of 64 subjects in study NGF0112 and 7 out of 68 patients in 
study NGF0212 showed quantifiable serum levels of rhNGF. Two of them were on placebo (vehicle). These 
serum concentrations of rhNGFh have been attributed to individual physiological fluctuation of the basal NGF 
level, rather than treatment-related absorption. 
Given the limited number and the variability of samples, no PK analysis was performed. No dose 
concentration relationship could be established.  
Immunogenicity 
Short and longer-term rhNGF immunogenicity after single and multiple ocular dosing of rhNGF eye drops 
(with and without L-methionine) at various concentrations in different populations including healthy subjects 
and NK patients. In two studies, NGF0212 and NGF0214, immunological data were obtained at the dose 
regimen proposed for NK treatment (20 µg/ml, one drop 6 times a day [4.2 µg/day] for 8 consecutive 
weeks). In both these studies, long-term immunogenicity was also assessed during follow-up. 
A validated ELISA assay was used to detect Immunoglobulin G antibodies against rhNGF 
Serum levels of rhNGF antibodies were found to be below the lower limit of quantification in all 4 studies 
where this parameter was examined (NGF0112, NGF0212, NGF0214 and NGF0113), suggesting that ocular 
rhNGF at treatment doses has no systemic immunogenic potential. This result was achieved across patient 
populations (healthy subjects and NK patients) and dose regimens (up to 180 μg/ml rhNGF three times a day 
for 24 consecutive weeks). No accumulation or long-term effects were seen.  
Assessment report  
EMA/351805/2017 
Page 40/104 
 
  
  
Distribution 
No clinical data were presented. Studies in rat and rabbit in which rhNGF was applied as eye drops at 
concentrations up to 60-fold the clinical dose indicated a variable, but overall low systemic exposure to 
rhNGF. Administration of radioactive rhNGF to male and female rats at a nominal dose level of 1.0 
μg/eye/dose resulted in the distribution of radioactivity mostly in the cornea and to some minor extent in the 
posterior portion of the eye. 
Elimination 
No clinical data in relation to metabolism and elimination of rhNGF has been provided. The applicant stated 
that rhNGF is a recombinant protein which is not metabolized by the ocular metabolizing enzymes with the 
exception of tissue proteases that could degrade it to the corresponding amino acids. After ocular 
administration, a good portion of the protein through the nasolacrimal duct reaches the nasal and then the 
oropharyngeal cavity and is then degraded by proteases. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Differences in doses and administration schedules were assessed as part of the clinical efficacy and safety 
programme only. 
Special populations 
No specific studies in special populations were conducted given the lack of systemic absorption of rhNGF after 
ocular administration. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No specific drug-interaction studies have been performed. Given the method of administration and the limited 
systemic exposure reached, no systemic drug-drug interactions are expected.  
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
To support the human PK development, the applicant conducted 3 studies with human biomaterials to 
determine the extent of binding of rhNGF to its associated receptors and its effects on cell differentiation. 
The affinity of rhNGF and mNGF for the human TrkA receptor was measured in HEK 293 cells using a 
homogeneous and non-radioactive cell-based assay. The HEK cells expressed TrkA which was fused to a 
SNAP tag, which in turn was labelled with a fluorescent donor dye (terbium cryptate), while NGF ligands were 
labelled with a red acceptor dye (d2). The binding of the ligand to TrkA receptor resulted in a measurable 
fluorescence resonance energy transfer. A competition assay was conducted using 10 concentrations of NGFs 
were tested at the previously determined optimal cell density (10000 cells/well) with a reference standard 
ligand (NGF-d2) used at 13 nmol. The assay showed that rhNGF had a higher affinity for the human TrkA 
receptor expressed in HEK293 cells than mNGF (inhibition constant Ki 3.7 nmol versus 6.2 nmol and median 
(50%) inhibition concentration IC50 of 7.5 nmol versus 12.4 nmol, respectively). The binding reaction was 
somehow slow and overnight incubations were needed for reaching equilibrium.

A second study was conducted to evaluate and compare the in vitro biological activity (EC50) and potency of 
rhNGF and mNGF using a well-established TF-1 cell proliferation assay adapted from Chevalier et al, 1994. 
Cells were seeded in a 96-well plate in the presence of rhNGF and mNGF in the concentration range of 0.3 pM 
(7.95 pg/ml) to 6.76 nmol (179.14 ng/ml) and incubated for 48 hours. Cell proliferation was evaluated by 
incubating cells for an additional 4 hours in the presence of a chromogenic substrate, then assessed using 
ELISA. The results showed that rhNGF was more active (approximately 10 fold) than mNGF in the TF-1 
assay. Mean EC50 calculated for rhNGF was 19.2 ± 1.6 pM (509.44 ± 42.45 pg/ml), whereas EC50 for mNGF 
was 237.4 ± 59.1 pM. 
Finally, in order to evaluate and compare the in vitro biological activity of rhNGF, mNGF and a Neurotrophin 
Mimetic (MimD3), using SH-SY5Y cells. Cells were seeded in an appropriate medium, with either N2 
differentiation supplement (control) or rhNGF and mNGF at concentrations of 25, 50 and 100 ng/ml 
(approximately 1 nmol, 2 nmol, 4 nmol) or MimD3 at 25, 50 and 100 ng/ml (36.85, 73.7 and 147.4 nmol) for 
a 7 day incubation period at 37 ˚C. The results showed that rhNGF, mNGF and MimD3 were not cytotoxic to a 
neuroblastoma-derived cell line at the tested concentrations. All compounds induced an increase of neurite 
localization of the early neuronal differentiation marker β-tubulin III, but rhNGF at 25 ng/ml was more 
effective than mNGF and MimD3 in promoting axonal sprouting and neurite length. MimD3 was the least 
active of the three compounds. At higher concentrations (100 ng/ml), the effect of both NGFs was 
comparable. Gap-43, a protein that it is highly expressed in processes related with axonal regeneration was 
mainly found in the axons of rhNGF treated cells and in the cytoplasm of mNGF cultures. Localization in 
axons was higher in rhNGF cultured cells at 50 ng/ml and levels were comparable at 100 ng/ml. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
In absence of adequate clinical models of NK, no specific clinical pharmacology studies have been conducted. 
Mechanism of action 
Cenegermin (rhNGF) is a recombinant form of human nerve growth factor, an endogenous protein involved in 
the differentiation and maintenance of neurons. NGF is naturally present in the eye and is essential for the 
survival and growth of sympathetic and sensory neurons and for differentiation of neurons in the central 
nervous system (CNS). The protein is highly conserved across species, with human NGF and mNGF sharing 
90% homology in the amino acid sequence of the mature protein.  
NGF binds with two entirely distinct classes of receptors: 1) tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA), a 
transmembrane tyrosine kinase that is also known as high-affinity NGF receptor, and 2) low-affinity NGF 
receptor, also called p75 neurotrophin receptor. NGF receptors are expressed on anterior segments of the 
eye (iris, ciliary body, lens, cornea and conjunctiva) (Lambiase et al., 2002; Qi et al., 2007) and by the 
lacrimal gland (Nguyen et al., 1997; Ghinelli et al., 2003; Vesaluoma et al., 2000) as well as by all the intra-
ocular tissues including the posterior segment of eye (Lambiase et al., 2002).  
NGF has been shown to play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of several ocular diseases, including NK. In 
NK, corneal sensory innervation is impaired, causing marked changes in the levels of neuromediators, and 
resulting in dystrophic changes of epithelial cells and consequently epithelial breakdown. NGF in turn has 
been shown to induce in vitro corneal epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation and it is involved in 
maintaining limbal epithelial stem cell potential (Kruse & Tseng, 1993; Qi et al., 2007). In addition, animal 
models of corneal injury (such as mechanical epithelial removal and refractive surgery) show that NGF

expression is increased following surgical procedures, and that NGF eye drop treatment stimulates corneal 
epithelial healing (Esquenazi et al., 2005). Evidence of NGF involvement in corneal trophism and homeostasis 
has been demonstrated in a molecular study on keratoconus cornea (Lambiase et al, 2005). Increasing 
evidence also shows that NGF is involved in the regulation of tear film production (Ghinelli et al., 2003). 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
No clinical PD clinical studies have been conducted by the applicant. Studies in human biomaterial 
demonstrating pharmacological activity of rhNGF relevant to its use in NK are summarised in section 2.4.2.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Limited clinical pharmacology data have been presented in support of this application. This was considered 
largely acceptable by the CHMP given the local route administration as well as low doses and limited duration 
of treatment required.  
For the most part, the PK data provided were considered reassuring showing no or very low systemic 
absorption after ocular instillation of rhNGF eye drops. Immunogenicity results complemented the PK findings 
indicating that ocular rhNGF is not systemically absorbed. No antibodies to rhNGF were detected in any of the 
subjects using rhNGF eye drops in the 4 studies where this parameter was examined, suggesting no systemic 
immunogenic potential including at the dose regimen proposed for use in NK patients. 
Since there is no adequate clinical model of NK, no specific clinical PD studies have been conducted, which 
was considered acceptable by the CHMP. Results of studies with human biomaterial (as well as from the 
clinical and non-clinical program) showed that rhNGF elicits bioactivity relevant to the proposed indication 
and has a 10-times higher affinity to the TrkA receptor when compared to mNGF. Furthermore, a better 
safety profile of rhNGF compared to mNGF can be assumed given that rhNGF is a recombinant form of human 
endogenous NGF. 
The lack of any information on the possibility of interactions with other ophthalmological medicines 
administered via the ocular route was explained by the applicant by the low interaction potential of rhNGF as 
it is a recombinant protein which is not metabolized by the ocular cytochrome P 450 enzymes or by any other 
ocular metabolizing enzyme with the exception of tissue proteases that could degrade it to the corresponding 
amino acid. Furthermore, in clinical practice, NK patients are advised to discontinue other topic treatments. 
rhNGF. The issue was not pursued in light of the available clinical data which did not suggest any problems 
with the co-administration of other ocular medicines (see section 2.6. ). 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology of Oxervate has been sufficiently well characterised to support the present 
application.

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
Study NGF0212 was the only clinical study that conducted a formal comparison between rhNGF doses, 
comparing 10 μg/ml and 20 μg/ml rhNGF to vehicle control. The rationale for selecting the 20 μg/ml dosage 
of rhNGF eye drops solution and the 6 times/day dosing regimen in both efficacy studies was derived from 
the results across the rhNGF clinical and non-clinical program as well as published literature.  
Published clinical studies using mNGF 200 μg/ml eye drops, administered to NK patients 6 times a day for up 
to 60 days (Bonini et al., 2000; Lambiase et al., 2007) showed complete corneal healing and corneal 
sensitivity improvement in the majority of patients (see summary in section 2.5.2.6. ). The mNGF used in 
these studies is closely homologous to rhNGF, so an extrapolation could be made across species. In addition, 
in vitro models utilizing human cells have demonstrated that rhNGF is more potent than mNGF by a factor of 
approximately 10 and hence supported a 10-fold reduction for the rhNGF dose. 
Furthermore, a dose-response relationship was identified in in vitro studies in rabbits and rats. A set of 
experiments in Sprague Dawley rats performed with the aim of comparing the efficacy of 10 and 20 μg/ml 
rhNGF administered according to 2 different schedules: 6 times per day (i.e. 1 eye drop every 2 hours) 
versus 3 times per day (i.e. 1 eye drop every 4 hours) showed a dose-response relationship. The largest 
effect was observed in rats treated with 20 μg/ml 6 times daily. The efficacy of rhNGF tended to decrease 
when the number of dispensed drops per day was reduced. A dose-response effect on neurite length was also 
observed in human biomaterial studies, with neurite length increasing with increasing rhNGF concentrations.  
Masked preliminary efficacy results of study NGF0212 showed a trend of increased efficacy of the 20 μg/ml 
as compared to the 10 μg/ml strength without additional safety concerns for the higher dose. Therefore, for 
study NGF0214, only 20 μg/ml rhNGF eye drops 6 times/day was selected for testing.  
Doses higher than 20 μg/ml were tested during Phase I of the clinical development (NGF0112) but only for 
safety and tolerability purposes.  
2.5.2.  Main study(ies) 
Two randomized, vehicle-controlled, double-masked, Phase II studies (NGF0212 and NGF0214) were 
conducted to support the efficacy of rhNGF in patients with stage 2 or 3 NK. 
Study NGF0212: An 8-week Phase I/II, Multicentre, Randomized, Double-masked, Vehicle-
controlled Parallel-group Study with a 48- or 56-week Follow-up Period to Evaluate the Safety and 
Efficacy of Two Doses (10 μg/ml and 20 μg/ml) of Recombinant Human Nerve Growth Factor Eye 
Drops Solution Versus Vehicle in Patients with Stage 2 and 3 of Neurotrophic Keratitis 
Study NGF0212 was conducted in several EU countries as an 8-week, randomized, double-masked, vehicle 
controlled, parallel group study, followed by a 48- or 56-week follow-up period. The study design consisted of 
a Phase I segment and Phase II segment with each part analysed separately. Only the Phase II segment of 
NGF0212 is included in this analysis of efficacy since the Phase I segment was conducted primarily for the 
assessment of PK parameters (see section 2.4.2. ).

Figure 2 - Design of Study NGF0212: Phase II Segment 
All patients completely healed at week 8 (including those receiving active treatment) were eligible for another 
course of treatment in the event of recurrence during the follow-up period.  
The follow-up period was 48 weeks (approximately 12 months) for patients who were initially randomized to 
rhNGF (10 μg/ml or 20 μg/ml), regardless of whether the patient was completely healed or not completely 
healed at Week 8. The follow-up period was also 48 weeks in length for patients who were initially 
randomized to vehicle and who were completely healed at Week 8. The follow-up period was 56 weeks 
(approximately 14 months) in length for patients who were initially randomized to vehicle and who were not 
completely healed at Week 8. These patients were randomly assigned to treatment with rhNGF (10 μg/ml or 
20 μg/ml) for 8 weeks (from Week 8 to Week 16); this was referred to as the uncontrolled treatment period. 
Study NGF0214: An 8-week phase II, multicentre, randomized, double-masked, vehicle controlled, 
parallel group study with a 24 or 32 week follow-up period to evaluate the efficacy of a 
formulation containing anti-oxidant of recombinant human nerve growth factor (rhNGF) in 
20 μg/ml, eye drops solution versus vehicle containing anti-oxidant in patients with Stage 2 and 3 
Neurotrophic Keratitis 
Study NGF0214 was conducted in the United States of America (USA) as an 8-week multicentre, randomized, 
vehicle controlled, double-masked, parallel-group study, followed by a 24- or 32-week follow-up period. The 
NGF0214 study was designed as a two-arm study to confirm superiority of the methionine containing rhNGF 
Assessment report  
EMA/351805/2017

20 μg/ml eye drops solution 6 times a day versus vehicle containing the same amount of methionine given 
6 times a day.  
Similar to study NGF0212, if not completely healed at week 8, patients randomized to vehicle during the 
controlled treatment period were eligible for a treatment with rhNGF 20 μg/ml during the uncontrolled 
treatment period. Patients, completely healed at Week 8 or Week 16, with a recurrent PED or corneal ulcer 
electing to receive an additional course of rhNGF treatment were followed with the assessments outlined in 
the 8 week, randomized, double-masked, controlled treatment period visits. A maximum of one additional 
rhNGF treatment course of 8 weeks could be given during the uncontrolled treatment period.

Treatments 
Test product: rhNGF 10 μg/ml (one 35 μl drop equals to 0.35 μg of rhNGF), or rhNGF 20 μg/ml (one 35 μl 
drop equals to 0.70 μg of rhNGF).  
Vehicle Control: Ophthalmic solution of the same composition as the test product but excluding rhNGF. 
In contrast to study NGF0212, both test products and vehicle contained the anti-oxidant L-methionine. 
The test product and vehicle were formulated as single-use preparation (frozen-solution packaged in a glass 
vial) and administered through a sterile polyethylene dropper (in the kit box there was a dropper per each 
vial). The study treatments were supplied in identical boxes. Each treatment kit included 7 boxes, each 
containing 6 frozen single-use vials of the randomized / assigned medication for daily treatment, i.e. a total 
number of 42 vials in each kit. At home the study medication was to be stored in the fridge at 2 - 8 °C for a 
maximum of 7 days. When the patient started to use the study medication he/she was to remove from the 
fridge only 1 daily boxincluding 6 single-use vials to be used over the course of the day. 
One drop (35 μl) of study medication was to be administered 6 times a day in the affected eye(s), during the 
8-week, randomized, double-masked, controlled treatment period and during the 8-week, uncontrolled 
treatment period for qualifying study subjects (see study design above).

Objectives 
Study NGF0212 primarily aimed at assessing safety and the efficacy of rhNGF eye drops solution (10 μg/ml 
or 20 μg/ml) compared to vehicle in inducing complete healing of Stage 2 (PED) and Stage 3 (corneal ulcer) 
NK as measured by the central reading centre evaluating the clinical pictures of corneal fluorescein staining. 
Secondary objectives of the study were to assess the complete healing as measured by the investigator, the 
duration of complete healing, improvement in visual acuity and improvement in corneal sensitivity, and 
percentage of patients achieving complete corneal clearing defined as complete absence of staining on the 
modified Oxford Scale. 
The primary objective of study NGF0214 was to evaluate the efficacy of 20 μg/ml rhNGF eye drops solution 
containing anti-oxidant compared to vehicle (formulation containing anti-oxidant) in inducing complete 
healing of stage 2 (PED) and 3 (corneal ulcer) NK as measured by the central reading centre, evaluating the 
clinical pictures of corneal fluorescein staining. Secondary objectives of the study were to assess the duration 
of complete healing, improvement in visual acuity and improvement in corneal sensitivity, and percentage of 
patients achieving complete corneal clearing defined as complete absence of staining on the modified Oxford 
Scale. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of patients experiencing complete healing, defined as the 
greatest diameter of corneal fluorescein staining in the area of the PED or corneal ulcer, as determined by the 
reading centre, being less than 0.5 mm. Corneal Fluorescein Staining using the modified Oxford scale was 
assessed at the slit lamp using a yellow barrier filter and cobalt blue illumination. 
In study NGF0212, complete corneal healing assessed at Week 4 was considered the primary efficacy 
endpoint, while in study NGF0214 complete healing at 8 weeks was chosen as primary study endpoint. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints: 
 
Percentage of patients experiencing complete healing of the PED or corneal ulcer determined by corneal 
fluorescein staining at 4 weeks (study NGF0212) or 8 weeks (study NGF0214) as defined by the 
Investigator. 
 
Percentage of patients experiencing complete healing of the PED or corneal ulcer at 6 and 8 weeks 
(NGF0212)/ 4 and 6 weeks (NGF0214) as measured by both the central reading centre and Investigator. 
 
Percentage of patients experiencing complete corneal clearing (Grade 0 on the modified Oxford scale) at 
4, 6 and 8 weeks. 
•  Mean change in BCDVA from baseline to Week 8. 
• 
• 
Percentage of patients that achieved a ≥15 letter gain in BCDVA at 4, 6, and 8 weeks. 
Percentage of patients that achieved an improvement in corneal sensitivity as measured by the Cochet-
Bonnet aesthesiometer at 4, 6 and 8 weeks (binary goal attainment variable: Week 4/6/8 corneal 
sensitivity – Baseline corneal sensitivity > 0 [Yes/No]). 
 
Percentage of patients experiencing deterioration (increase in lesion size ≥ 1mm, decrease in BCDVA by 
>5 ETDRS letters, progression in lesion depth to corneal melting or perforation, onset of infection) in 
Stage 2 or 3 NK from baseline to Weeks 4, 6 and 8.

 
 
Time to onset of deterioration from baseline to Week 8. 
Investigator global evaluation of efficacy at 4 and 8 weeks. 
Study NFG0212 included the following secondary efficacy endpoints related to the follow-up period: 
 
Percentage of patients achieving complete healing of the PED or corneal ulcer by Week 8/16 that 
remained healed (ie, no recurrence) at Weeks 20/28, 32/40, 44/52, 56/64. 
  Mean change in BCDVA in patients achieving complete healing by Week 8/16 at Weeks 20/28, 32/40, 
44/52, 56/64. 


 
 
Percentage of patients achieving complete healing by Week 8/16 with improved or no change in corneal 
sensitivity that show further improvement or no change at Weeks 20/28, 32/40, 44/52, 56/64. 
Percentage of patients achieving complete healing by Week 8/16 with no recurrence of Stage 2 (PED) or 
Stage 3 (corneal ulcer) at Weeks 20/28, 32/40, 44/52, 56/64. 
Time to recurrence of Stage 2 (PED) or Stage 3 (corneal ulcer) in patients achieving complete healing by 
Week 8/16, defined as the stage of NK recorded by the Investigator as Stage 2 or Stage 3 after healing. 
Study NFG0212 also included a number of exploratory efficacy variables, including time to complete corneal 
clearing and to onset of healing (defined as a >20% reduction in the greatest diameter of the lesion), change 
in Schirmer’s without anesthesia score, change in tear film osmolarity and change in National Eye Institute 
Visual Functioning Questionnaire 25 (NEI-VFQ) and EuroQol 5D (EQ-5D) scores. 
Sample size 
The sample size for study NGF0212 was calculated based on an estimated 60% of patients achieving 
complete healing of the PED or corneal ulcer with rhNGF eye drops at 4 weeks as compared to 30% in 
patients treated with the vehicle. Based on this, the Phase II segment of study NGF0212 needed 
141 evaluable patients to have 80% power to detect such a difference. Assuming a drop-out rate of 10-20%, 
a minimum of 156 patients were to be randomized in the Phase II segment. This sample size was considered 
adequate to evaluate safety for progression to continue into Phase II of the study. A minimum of 174 
patients in total (including 18 patients for the Phase I segment) was planned to be randomized. 
The sample size calculation for study NGF0214 was based on the assumption of the statistical superiority of 
rhNGF 20 μg/ml versus vehicle and on preliminary masked data from the ongoing NGF0212 study after 
Week 8. The proportion of patients achieving complete healing of the PED at Week 8 was estimated at 70% 
in the rhNGF 20 μg/ml treated group and 30% for vehicle. Thirty eight patients (19 patients in each 
treatment arms) were to be recruited in order to observe with 80% power a difference in the healing rate of 
40% between treatments using a one-sided Chi-square test. At least 48 patients were considered necessary 
to be randomized to have at least 38 evaluable patients for the statistical analysis. 
Randomisation 
Eligible patients were randomized using an Interactive Web Response System. Patients were randomized in a 
1:1:1 ratio (study NGF0212) or 1:1 ratio (study NGF0214) to either active or vehicle treatment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/351805/2017 
Page 49/104 
 
  
  
In the phase II segment of study NGF0212, included in the baseline randomization scheme for all patients 
assigned to vehicle was a randomized secondary treatment assignment to active study medication (rhNGF 10 
μg/ml or 20 μg/ml). This randomized secondary treatment assignment defined the regimen of the active 
study medication that the patients in the vehicle control arm would receive during the 56-week follow-up 
period if not completely healed at Week 8, or in the event of a recurrence of their PED or corneal ulcer. 
Blinding (masking) 
During the 8-week randomized, double-masked controlled treatment period, the patient, the investigator, all 
other site staff involved in study assessments, and the sponsor’s clinical research personnel were blinded to 
the study treatment. In study NGF0212, although only treatment with rhNGF was administered during the 
48- or 56-week follow-up period, the rhNGF dose administered was not made known to the sponsor, patients, 
investigators and site personnel, and the treatment assignments during the 8-week controlled treatment 
period were not disclosed. Unmasking during the studies occurred only if the patient progressed to 
deterioration of their Stage 2 or 3 NK or in the case of medical emergencies where the knowledge of patient 
treatment was required to provide the patient with appropriate care. 
The study treatments were supplied in identical boxes, and the vials of rhNGF (both doses) and the vials 
containing the vehicle were identical in appearance and the contents of the vials were indistinguishable. 
Statistical methods 
Study Populations 
The following populations were used for the analysis and presentation of the study data. 
 
Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population: The ITT population was defined as all randomized patients. The ITT 
population was used to present all efficacy analyses. Patients were summarized according to the 
treatment to which they were randomized. 
  Safety Population: The Safety population was defined as all randomized patients who received at 
least 1 dose of study medication. The Safety Population was used to present all safety summaries.  
Primary Analysis:  
For study NGF0214, there were 2 planned comparisons of the percentage of patients achieving complete 
healing of the PED or corneal ulcer at Week 4, comparing the rhNGF 10 μg/ml group against vehicle and 
comparing the rhNGF 20 μg/ml group with vehicle. In addition, the two rhNGF treatment groups were 
compared against each other to test possible differences between the doses. This comparison between the 
active doses was considered exploratory. Each of the comparisons was conducted on the data for the Phase II 
segment of the study using a 2 × 2 chi-square test, based on the null hypothesis that there was no 
association between treatment (rhNGF or Vehicle Control) and response (Complete Healing at Week 4 
[Yes/No]). In the case of missing data at Week 4, the last post-Baseline observation prior to Week 4 was 
carried forward for the primary analysis. An observed case analysis was also conducted. The significance level 
of the chi-square test was corrected for multiplicity according to the Pocock method, and the 2-sided 
significance level α for statistical tests was 0.0294. 
For study NGF0212, the two-sided significance level for the 2x2 chi-square test was 0.10 to compare patients 
receiving 20 μg/ml rhNGF to patients receiving vehicle. Patients, who discontinued before Week 4 (and who 
Assessment report  
EMA/351805/2017 
Page 50/104 
 
  
  
did not have a post-baseline corneal photograph with fluorescein), were assumed to have been ‘Not 
Completely Healed’ for primary efficacy endpoint if the investigator recorded that the ‘measurement was N/A 
because the greatest dimension of the PED or corneal ulcer evaluated was greater than 1 mm on the slit 
lamp’. If no post-baseline values were available, no imputation was performed, the patient was assumed to 
have a missing 'Completely Healed’ endpoint and was not included in the analysis. All other missing 
evaluations were imputed by the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method up to the 8 Week visit. 
Sensitivity analyses included multiple imputation methods for missing data. In addition, in study NGF0212 an 
analysis was performed of patients considered to have not completely healed (ie, were treated as failures) if 
they did not have a completely healed Yes/No response as determined by the reading centre at Week 4, 
irrespective of the reason for the missing data. In study NGF0214, additional sensitivity analyses were 
performed (i) on observed cases removing patients who were discontinued from the study before week 4, 
and (ii) imputing all missing completely healed statuses as failures. 
In study NGF0212, as an additional exploratory analysis, the chi-square treatment comparisons described 
above were repeated for the subgroups of patients with evidence of punctual occlusion during the external 
ocular examination of the affected eye at any visit from Baseline to Week 4 and those with no such evidence. 
Secondary analysis:  
The chi-square treatment comparisons described for the primary endpoint was also conducted at the 
significance level of 0.0294 (study NGF0212) or 0.10 (study NGF0214) for secondary endpoints of complete 
healing. For endpoints concerning the percentage of patients who experienced complete corneal clearing, 
achieved 15 letter gain in BCDVA or improvements in corneal sensitivity, and who experienced deterioration, 
chi-square treatment comparisons were conducted. The mean change in BCDVA score from the Baseline visit 
to the Week 8 visit was analysed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model including treatment and 
Baseline BCDVA score as covariates. In study NGF0212, the ANCOVA analysis also included amount of 
corneal anaesthesia at baseline, time since diagnosis of NK and Schirmer test value as covariates. A Kaplan-
Meier survival analysis was performed on the time to onset of deterioration from baseline to week 8. 
For the investigator global evaluation of efficacy in study NGF0212, the number and percentage of patients 
with investigator responses in each of the following categories (‘Very Good’, ‘Good’, ‘Moderate’, ‘Poor’ and 
‘Non-evaluable’) was recorded. Data were analysed by means of a multinomial proportional odds model. The 
model included treatment, visit and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects with patient identifier as 
the repeated variable. In study NGF0214, data were collected as a categorical variable (‘Very satisfactory’, 
‘Satisfactory’, ‘Not very satisfactory’ and ‘Unsatisfactory’) and analysed with a chi-square test. 
No formal statistical testing of the data collected during the follow-up period of study NGF0212 was 
performed.  
2.5.2.2.  Results for Study NFG0212 
Participant flow 
A total of 156 patients were randomized to the controlled treatment period: 52 patients in each treatment 
group. Of the 156 patients randomized, a total of 109 patients (69.9%) entered the 48-week follow-up 
period. A total of 52 patients (33.3%) were withdrawn prematurely from the study including slightly more in 
the active arms compared to vehicle.

Of the 52 patients who were initially randomized to the vehicle control group during the 8-week controlled 
treatment period, a total of 23 patients (44.2%) were randomized to the uncontrolled treatment period at 
Week 8: 10 patients were randomized to rhNGF 10 μg/ml and 13 patients were randomized to rhNGF 
20 μg/ml. Of these 23 patients, 22 patients (95.7%) entered the 56-week follow-up period: 9 patients in the 
rhNGF 10 μg/ml group and 13 patients in the rhNGF 20 μg/ml group. A total of 16 patients (69.6%) 
completed the study.

Recruitment 
Date of first observation: 30 Jan 2013; date of last observation: 19 May 2016. 
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol, dated 19 July 2012, was amended 4 times. Furthermore, there were 3 addenda to the 
statistical analysis plan (SAP). These included the introduction of additional post-hoc analyses. After

finalisation of the main clinical study report, the US Food and Drug Administration requested the sponsor to 
repeat the analyses of complete healing at Week 4 and Week 8, considering patients with persistent residual 
staining (ie, persistent in a specific zone of the cornea) to be not completely healed. 
Overall, a total of 30 protocol violations were reported during the study. The main categories of protocol 
violations were: concomitant medications (occurring in 9 patients), inclusion criteria and/or exclusion criteria 
(occurring in 9 patients), investigational product (occurring in 4 patients), informed consent (occurring in 2 
patients), and randomization, visit schedule, study procedures, and “Other” (patient did not stop 
preservative-free artificial tears at Day 0 and stopped at Week 2) (each occurring in 1 patient).  
Baseline data 
A summary of demographics for patients in the Phase II segment of the study (Safety population) is 
presented in Table 3. Overall, 61 patients (39.1%) were male and 95 patients (60.9%) female. The mean 
age was 60.6 years with a range of 18 to 95 years.

Medical History 
Overall, 76 patients (48.7%) had Stage 2 NK and 80 patients (51.3%) had Stage 3 NK. The duration of the 
disease prior to enrolment was approximately 28 months and PED or corneal ulcers had been present on 
average for 17 months. Herpetic keratitis (herpes simplex, herpes zoster) was the main aetiology, with 
surgical procedures, dry eye disease and diabetes mellitus being reported less frequently.

Prior and concomitant medication 
Overall, the most commonly used prior medications for NK were topical antibiotics (95 patients, 60.9%), 
followed by artificial tears/gels/ointments (79 patients, 50.6%), preservative free artificial 
tears/gels/ointments (71 patients, 45.5%), and therapeutic contact lenses (47 patients, 30.1%). A total of 
66 patients (42.3%) reported the use of “Other” prior treatments for NK.  
During the controlled treatment period, concomitant ocular medications were taken by 68 patients (43.6%) 
overall: 21 patients (40.4%) in the rhNGF 10 μg/ml group, 26 patients (50.0%) in the rhNGF 20 μg/ml 
group, and 21 patients (40.4%) in the vehicle control group. The most common concomitant ocular 
medications taken during the controlled treatment period were reported as ofloxacin (13 patients, 18.3%), 
hyaluronate sodium (10 patients, 6.4%), aciclovir (8 patients, 5.1%), chloramphenicol and levofloxacin 
(7 patients each, 4.5%), dexpanthenol (6 patients, 3.8%), and ophthalmologicals (5 patients, 3.2%). 
During the controlled treatment period, concomitant systemic medications were taken by 115 patients 
(73.7%) overall: 36 patients (69.2%) in the rhNGF 10 μg/ml group, 39 patients (75.0%) in the rhNGF 20 
μg/ml group, and 40 patients (76.9%) in the vehicle control group. The most commonly used concomitant 
systemic medications during the controlled treatment period were beta blocking agents (38 patients, 24.4%), 
agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system (37 patients, 23.7%), antithrombotic agents (33 patients, 
21.2%), and drugs for acid related disorders (30 patients, 19.2%). The most commonly used concomitant 
systemic medication during the controlled treatment period was acetylsalicylic acid (19 patients, 12.2%). 
Numbers analysed 
In the Phase II segment of the study, all 156 patients (52 patients in each treatment group) were included in 
the ITT population and in the Safety population. For the uncontrolled treatment period, all 10 patients who 
were randomized to rhNGF 10 μg/ml and all 13 patients who were randomized to rhNGF 20 μg/ml, were 
included in the ITT population and in the Safety population. 
Outcomes and estimation 
A summary of the most relevant results is provided below. 
•  Primary Efficacy Analysis: Complete Healing at Week 4 
After 4 weeks of treatment, complete healing of the PED or corneal was achieved in a total of 67 patients 
overall: 28 patients (54.9%) in the rhNGF 10 μg/ml group, 29 patients (58.0%) in the rhNGF 20 μg/ml 
group, and 10 patients (19.6%) in the vehicle control group. The percentage of patients who achieved 
complete healing was found to be statistically significantly higher in the rhNGF treatment groups compared to 
the vehicle control group. There was no significant difference between the rhNGF 10 μg/ml and rhNGF 
20 μg/ml doses at Week 4 (p=0.754).

The results of the observed case analysis for complete healing at Week 4 were consistent with the primary 
analysis. Furthermore, as a sensitivity analysis, the primary efficacy variable was analysed firstly by imputing 
missing data as failures and secondly by using multiple imputation for missing data. The findings of the 
sensitivity analyses were similar to the results of the primary analysis. 
•  Secondary Efficacy Analyses (Controlled Treatment Period) 
Complete Healing at Week 8 as Determined by the Reading Centre 
Complete healing of the PED or corneal ulcer at Week 8, as determined by the reading centre, was achieved 
in a total of 97 patients overall: 38 patients (74.5%) in the rhNGF 10 μg/ml group, 37 patients (74.0%) in 
the rhNGF 20 μg/ml group, and 22 patients (43.1%) in the vehicle control group. The percentage of patients 
who achieved complete healing was found to be statistically significantly higher in the rhNGF treatment 
groups compared to the vehicle control group. There was no significant difference between the rhNGF 10 
μg/ml and rhNGF 20 μg/ml doses at Week 8 (p=0.953). 
Furthermore, 23 patients randomized to the vehicle control arm at baseline who worsened before Week 8 or 
were non-completely healed at Week 8 entered the uncontrolled treatment period and received rhNGF during 
Week 8-16. A post-hoc subgroup analysis of these patients showed that there were 4 patients in the rhNGF 
10 μg/ml group (4/10 = 40%) and 8 patients in the rhNGF 20 μg/ml group (8/13 = 61.5%) achieving 
complete corneal healing by Week 16.

Investigator was achieved in a total of 90 patients overall: 37 patients (78.7%) in the rhNGF 10 μg/ml group, 
33 patients (78.6%) in the rhNGF 20 μg/ml group, and 20 patients (52.6%) on vehicle control. The difference 
between the rhNGF 10 μg/ml group and vehicle was 26.1% (97.06% CI: 4.18, 48.01; p=0.011). The 
difference between the rhNGF 20 μg/ml group and vehicle was 25.9% (97.06% CI: 3.55, 48.33; p=0.014).  
There was no significant difference between the 2 active treatment arms at any time point. 
Complete Corneal Clearing 
Of the 131 patients with a response available at Week 4, 21 patients experienced complete corneal clearing: 
10 (20.8%) patients in the rhNGF 10 μg/ml group, 8 (19.5%) patients in the rhNGF 20 μg/ml group, and 
3 (7.1%) patients in the vehicle control group. The difference between the rhNGF 10 μg/ml group and vehicle

was 13.7% (95% CI: -0.19, 27.57, p=0.065). The difference between the rhNGF 20 μg/ml group and vehicle 
was 12.4% (95% CI: -2.05, 26.78, p=0.097).  
Of the 130 patients with a response available at Week 8, 26 patients experienced complete corneal clearing: 
13 (27.1%) patients in the rhNGF 10 μg/ml group, 9 (21.4%) patients in the rhNGF 20 μg/ml group, and 
4 (10.0%) patients in the vehicle control group. The difference between the rhNGF 10 μg/ml group and 
vehicle was 17.1% (95% CI: 1.45, 32.72, p=0.043). The difference between the rhNGF 20 μg/ml group and 
vehicle was 11.4% (95% CI: -4.08, 26.93, p=0.157).  
There was no significant difference between the 2 active treatment arms at either time point.

Of the 133 patients who had a response available at Week 4, a 15 letter gain in BCDVA score was achieved in 
18 (36.7%) patients in the rhNGF 10 μg/ml group, 14 (34.1%) patients in the rhNGF 20 μg/ml group, 
and 9 (20.9%) patients in the vehicle control group. There was no significant difference between the rhNGF 
10 μg/ml and vehicle (p= 0.097), the rhNGF 20 μg/ml and vehicle (p= 0.175), or the rhNGF 10 μg/ml and 
rhNGF 20 μg/ml doses (p= 0.798).  
Of the 129 patients who had a response available at Week 8, a 15 letter gain in BCDVA score (or more) was 
achieved in 24 (50.0%) patients in the rhNGF 10 μg/ml group, 17 (41.5%) patients in the rhNGF 20 μg/ml 
group, and 9 (22.5%) patients in the vehicle group. The difference between rhNGF 10 μg/ml and vehicle was 
27.5% (95% CI: 8.33, 46.67), and was statistically significant (p=0.008). The difference between rhNGF 
20 μg/ml and vehicle was 19.0% (95% CI: -0.91, 38.83), and did not reach statistical significance (p= 
0.068). There was no significant difference between rhNGF 10 μg/ml and 20 μg/ml (p= 0.421). 
Improvement in Corneal Sensitivity 
Of the 122 patients who had a response available at Week 4, an improvement in corneal sensitivity was 
achieved in a total of 79 patients overall: 31 patients (68.9%) in the rhNGF 10 μg/ml group, 22 patients 
(61.1%) in the rhNGF 20 μg/ml group, and 26 patients (63.4%) in the vehicle control group. There was no

significant difference between the rhNGF 10 μg/ml group and vehicle (p= 0.592), the rhNGF 20 μg/ml group 
and vehicle (p=0.835), or between the rhNGF 10 μg/ml and 20 μg/ml doses (p= 0.465). 
Of the 118 patients who had a response available at Week 8, an improvement in corneal sensitivity was 
achieved in a total of 88 patients overall: 33 patients (78.6%) in the rhNGF 10 μg/ml group, 29 patients 
(76.3%) in the rhNGF 20 μg/ml group, and 26 patients (68.4%) in the vehicle control group. There was no 
significant difference between the rhNGF 10 μg/ml group and vehicle (p= 0.303), the rhNGF 20 μg/ml group 
and vehicle (p=0.442) or the rhNGF 10 μg/ml and 20 μg/ml doses (p= 0.809). 
Deterioration from Baseline 
Of the 134 patients with a response available at Week 4, one patient each in the rhNGF 10 μg/ml group and 
20 μg/ml group, and 2 patients in the vehicle control group experienced deterioration. Of the 130 patients 
with a response available at Week 8, 11 patients experienced deterioration: 2 patients in the rhNGF 10 μg/ml 
group, 3 patients in the rhNGF 20 μg/ml group, and 6 patients in the vehicle control group. There was no 
significant difference between treatment groups in the percentage of patients with deterioration at wither 
time point. Median time to onset of deterioration in the 3 treatment groups (Kaplan-Meier analysis) was not 
estimable due to the small number of events. 
Investigator Global Evaluation of Efficacy 
Of the 132 patients with a response available at Week 4, 19 patients (39.6%) in the rhNGF 10 μg/ml group, 
14 patients (34.1%) in the rhNGF 20 μg/ml group, and 11 patients (25.6%) in the vehicle control group had 
an evaluation response of “Very Good”. The odds ratio of a more favourable response at Week 4 between the 
rhNGF 10 μg/ml group and vehicle was 2.18 (95% CI: 1.03, 4.62; p=0.041). The odds ratio was neither 
statistically significant between the rhNGF 20 μg/ml group and vehicle (p=0.081), nor between the active 
arms (p=0.755). The results at Week 8 were consistent with the findings at Week 4 with slightly higher rates 
of patients with an evaluation response of “Very Good”. 
•  Exploratory Variables (Controlled Treatment Period) 
The median time to onset of healing (defined as a >20% reduction in the greatest diameter of the lesion 
compared to Baseline) was 8 days (95% CI: 7, 14), 14 days (95% CI: 7, 14), and 14 days (95% CI: 14, 28), 
in the rhNGF 10 μg/ml group, 20 μg/ml group, and vehicle control group, respectively. The median time to 
complete healing (defined as the greatest diameter of the lesion being less than 0.5 mm) was 29 days (95% 
CI: 20, 55), 28 days (95% CI: 19, 55), and 56 days (95% CI: 42, not estimable), in the rhNGF 10 μg/ml 
group, 20 μg/ml group, and vehicle control group, respectively.  
The mean Schirmer test measurement at Baseline was 10.1 mm (SD=7.30) in the rhNGF 10 μg/ml group, 
10.0 mm (SD=7.14) in the rhNGF 20 μg/ml group, and 12.6 mm (SD=11.71) in the vehicle control group. 
The mean change from Baseline at Week 4 was 3.7 mm (SD=8.35) for rhNGF 10 μg/ml, 3.0 mm (SD=6.18) 
for rhNGF 20 μg/ml and -0.9 mm (SD=8.13) for vehicle. The mean change from Baseline at Week 8 was 4.2 
mm (SD=8.83) for rhNGF 10 μg/ml, 2.0 mm (SD=8.82) for rhNGF 20 μg/ml, and -1.7 mm (SD=10.48) for 
vehicle. The overall difference in LS mean change from Baseline (Mixed Effects Repeated Measures model) 
between the rhNGF 10 μg/ml group and vehicle was statistically significant (95% CI: 0.89, 6.66; p=0.011). 
There were no significant differences in LS mean change from Baseline between the rhNGF 20 μg/ml group 
and vehicle, or between the rhNGF 10 μg/ml and rhNGF 20 μg/ml doses, at Week 4, Week 8, or overall. 
The mean tear film osmolarity at Baseline was 302.4 mOsm/L (SD=15.99) in the rhNGF 10 μg/ml group 
(n=7), 288.3 mOsm/L (SD=9.82) in the rhNGF 20 μg/ml group (n=8), and 297.5 mOsm/L (SD=8.04) in the 
vehicle control group (n=6). At Week 4 and Week 8, an increase in mean tear film osmolarity was observed

in the rhNGF 20 μg/ml group. This increase was not observed in the rhNGF 10 μg/ml group or in the vehicle 
control group: At Week 4, the mean change from Baseline in mean tear film osmolarity was -7.0 mOsm/L 
(SD=10.20) in the rhNGF 10 μg/ml group, 14.0 mOsm/L (SD=19.17) in the rhNGF 20 μg/ml group, and - 8.7 
mOsm/L (SD=4.62) in the vehicle control group. At Week 8, the mean change from Baseline in mean tear 
film osmolarity was -2.8 mOsm/L (SD=13.33) in the rhNGF 10 μg/ml group, 11.2 mOsm/L (SD=13.91) in the 
rhNGF 20 μg/ml group, and -3.3 mOsm/L (SD=16.29) in the vehicle control group. 
The mean NEI-VFQ overall composite score at Baseline was 56.51 (SD=19.957) in the rhNGF 10 μg/ml 
group, 56.57 (SD=24.971) in the rhNGF 20 μg/ml group, and 58.64 (SD=23.876) in the vehicle control. The 
LS mean change in NEI-VFQ overall composite score from Baseline to Week 8 was 7.9 (SE=1.79) in the 
rhNGF 10 μg/ml group, 4.8 (SE=1.92) in the rhNGF 20 μg/ml group, and 3.2 (SE=1.94) in the vehicle control 
group. There was no significant difference in LS mean change from Baseline between the treatment groups. 
The mean EQ-5D health state score at Baseline was 63.3 (SD=22.21) in the rhNGF 10 μg/ml group, 62.9 
(SD=19.79) in the rhNGF 20 μg/ml group, and 68.8 (SD=16.41) in the vehicle control group. The LS mean 
change in EQ-5D health state score from Baseline to Week 8 was 4.5 (SE=2.25) in the rhNGF 10 μg/ml 
group, 2.8 (SE=2.43) in the rhNGF 20 μg/ml group, and 0.2 (SE=2.45) in the vehicle control group. There 
was no significant difference in LS mean change from Baseline between the treatment groups. 
•  48- or 56-Week Follow-Up Period 
The efficacy analysis of the follow-up period considered only patients who were completely healed at 
Week 8/16. The analyses were based on all patients initially assigned to one of the active treatment arms as 
well as all patients in the vehicle arm not healed at Week 8 and thereafter assigned to rhNGF 10 or 20 μg/ml.  
Patients Remaining Healed During Follow-up

Best Corrected Distance Visual Acuity Score During Follow-up 
For patients who achieved complete healing at either Week 8/16, the mean BCDVA score at Baseline was 
32.7 (SD=28.83) in the rhNGF 10 μg/ml group (n=40), 28.7 (SD=26.82) in the rhNGF 20 μg/ml group 
(n=43), and 38.2 (SD=26.55) in the vehicle control group (n=22). An increase from Baseline in the mean 
BCDVA score was observed across the treatment groups at Weeks 20/28, 32/40, 44/52, and 56/64. 
In the 10 μg/ml group, the mean change from Baseline in BCDVA score was 16.7 (SD=21.43), 17.6 
(SD=22.96), 22.3 (SD=20.68), and 18.6 (SD=23.66) at Weeks 20/28, 32/40, 44/52, and 56/64, 
respectively. In the rhNGF 20 μg/ml group, the mean change from Baseline in BCDVA score was 15.5 
(SD=21.51), 17.4 (SD=20.28), 16.3 (SD=23.18), and 16.9 (SD=24.31) at Weeks 20/28, 32/40, 44/52, and 
56/64, respectively. In the vehicle control group, the mean change from Baseline in BCDVA score was 9.1 
(SD=12.58), 6.5 (SD=15.56), 6.1 (SD=17.59), and 9.1 (SD=17.99) at Weeks 20/28, 32/40, 44/52, and 
56/64, respectively.

The percentage of Phase II patients who achieved complete healing at Week 8/16 and achieved a 15 letter 
gain in BCDVA score during the follow-up period (ITT population) was: 
  After 12 weeks of follow-up (at Week 20/28) 51.3% of patients in the rhNGF 10 μg/ml group, 45.0% in 
the rhNGF 20 μg/ml group, and 33.3% in the vehicle control group achieved a 15 letter gain in BCVA. 
  After 24 weeks of follow-up (at Week 32/40) the figures are 47.1% of patients in the rhNGF 10 μg/ml 
group, 45.9% in the rhNGF 20 μg/ml group, and 23.8% in the vehicle control group. 
  After 36 weeks of follow-up (at Week 44/52), 67.7% of patients in the rhNGF 10 μg/ml group, 47.4% in 
the rhNGF 20 μg/ml group, and 28.6% in the vehicle control group achieved a 15 letter gain in BCDVA. 
  After 48 weeks of follow-up (at Week 56/64), 58.1% of patients in the rhNGF 10 μg/ml group, 37.1% in 
the rhNGF 20 μg/ml group, and 28.6% in the vehicle control group achieved a 15 letter gain in BCDVA. 
Corneal Sensitivity During Follow-up 
Of the 73 patients who had a response available after 24 weeks of follow-up (at Week 32/40), 28 patients 
(100.0%) in the rhNGF 10 μg/ml group, 29 patients (96.7%) in the rhNGF 20 μg/ml group, and 14 patients 
(93.3%) in the vehicle control group showed an improvement or no change in corneal sensitivity at this time 
point during the follow-up period. 
Of the 68 patients who had a response available after 48 weeks of follow-up (at Week 56/64), 24 out of 25 
patients (96.0%) in the rhNGF 10 μg/ml group, 27 out of 28 patients (96.4%) in the rhNGF 20 μg/ml group, 
and all 15 patients (100.0%) in the vehicle control group showed an improvement or no change in corneal 
sensitivity at this time point during the follow-up period. 
Complete Corneal Clearing During Follow-up 
Overall, 25 patients had a response available after 24 weeks of follow-up (at Week 32/40), of which 
16 patients maintained complete corneal clearing at this time point: 8 patients (80.0%) in the rhNGF 
10 μg/ml group, 6 patients (54.5%) in the rhNGF 20 μg/ml group, and 2 patients (50.0%) in the vehicle 
control group. After 48 weeks of follow-up (at Week 56/64), 22 patients had a response available, of which 
11 patients maintained complete corneal clearing at this time point: 6 patients (66.7%) in  the rhNGF 10 
μg/ml group, 3 patients (33.3%) in the rhNGF 20 μg/ml group, and 2 patients (50.0%) in the vehicle group. 
Ancillary (post-hoc) analyses 
Corneal Healing defined as no corneal fluorescein staining in the area of the PED or corneal ulcer, and non-
persistent lesions in the surrounding area of the cornea 
At Week 4, 49.0% (25/51) of patients in the rhNGF 10 μg/ml group and 58.0% (29/50) of patients in the 
rhNGF 20 μg/ml group were completely healed with zero staining as definition of complete healing compared 
to 13.7% (7/51) in the vehicle group. Statistical significance against vehicle was achieved for both 10 and 
20 μg/ml rhNGF groups (p<0.001). There was no significant difference between the rhNGF doses (p=0.366).  
At Week 8, complete corneal healing with no residual staining was achieved in 32/51 patients (62.7%) in the 
rhNGF 10 μg/ml group, 36/50 patients (72.0%) in the rhNGF 20 μg/ml group, and 17/51 patients (33.3%) in 
the vehicle control group. The difference was 29.4% (97.06% CI: 8.82, 50.01; p=0.003) between rhNGF 
10 μg/ml and vehicle and 38.7% (97.06% CI: 18.72, 58.62; p<0.001) between rhNGF 20 μg/ml and vehicle.

Time from End of Treatment to Recurrence 
Of the Phase II patients who achieved complete healing at either Week 8/16, a total of 19 patients had a 
recurrence of PED or corneal ulcer during follow-up: 7 patients in the rhNGF 10 μg/ml group, 10 patients in 
the rhNGF 20 μg/ml group, and 2 patients in the vehicle control group. The mean time from end of treatment 
regimen including complete healing to recurrence of PED or corneal ulcer during follow-up for completely 
healed patients was 54.9 days (SD=53.60) in the rhNGF 10 μg/ml group (n=7), 114.4 days (SD=106.08) in 
the rhNGF 20 μg/ml group (n=10), and 188.5 days (SD=222.74) in the vehicle control group (n=2). 
Patients with Specific NK aetiologies 
An exploratory post-hoc efficacy analysis was conducted to determine the effect of rhNGF on complete 
healing (as determined by the reading centre) at Week 4 and 8 in Phase II patients with specific aetiologies 
(acoustic neuroma, neurosurgical procedure, meningioma, and schwannoma). This subgroup of patients 
represents a NK population with isolated damage to the trigeminal nerve or to its main trunks, who are likely 
to experience corneal disease progression. Of the 21 patients with specific aetiologies of NK, complete 
healing (as determined by the reading centre) at Week 4 was achieved in a total of 11 patients overall: 4/6 
patients (66.7%) in the rhNGF 10 μg/ml group, 6/8 patients (75.0%) in the rhNGF 20 μg/ml group, and 1/7 
patients (14.3%) in the vehicle control group. No statistically significant difference was observed between 
treatment groups. At Week 8, complete healing was achieved in a total of 12 patients due to one more 
patient in the vehicle arm; the difference between treatment groups remained statistically not significant.  
Additional post-hoc analyses were performed in response to a request by the CHMP for the most 
representative local and systemic NK aetiologies. 
Table 10 - Percentage of Patients by NK Aetiology with Complete Healing at the End of 
Treatment (Stud NGF0212 Phase II) 
a “Herpes” includes both Simplex and Zoster; 
b “Innervation alterations” include both neurosurgical procedures and isolated diseases of the trigeminal/cranial nerves. 
Patients with Punctual Occlusion 
Only 4 patients (2 patients in the rhNGF 20 μg/ml group and 2 patients in the vehicle control group) had 
evidence of punctual occlusion and had a response available at Week 4. Of these 4 patients, 1 patient in each 
group achieved complete healing as determined by the reading centre at Week 4. There was no significant 
difference between the rhNGF group and the vehicle control group (p>0.999).

2.5.2.3.  Results for Study NFG0214 
Participant flow 
A total of 48 patients were randomized to study NGF0214: 24 patients in each treatment group. One patient 
was randomised although he was not eligible for the study and therefore discontinued the study before 
receiving any study medication and was not included in the Safety Population. 
Figure 3 – Patient Disposition (Study NGF0214) 
A total of 33 randomized patients (33/48= 68.8%) completed the 8-week Controlled Treatment Period: 
18 (18/24=75.0%) patients in the rhNGF treatment arm and 15 (15/24=62.5%) patients in the vehicle arm. 
Seven vehicle patients were considered to be not completely healed at week 8 and continued directly into the 
Uncontrolled Treatment Period with rhNGF for 8 weeks. Further, 6 vehicle patients terminated the Controlled 
Treatment Period prematurely and continued directly into the Uncontrolled Treatment Period with rhNGF. 
Assessment report  
EMA/351805/2017 
Page 64/104 
 
  
  
 
 
Therefore, 13 patients, randomized to initial treatment with vehicle, received at least a single dose of rhNGF 
in the Uncontrolled Treatment Period. 
Recruitment 
First patient randomized: 1 May 2015; Last patient completed: 06 Aug 2016 (date of last observation). 
Conduct of the study 
Three (3) protocol amendments and a number of refinements to the statistical analyses were implemented. 
SAP version 3.0, which was used for present analysis, was finalised and signed off prior to database lock for 
the main objective analysis. The following main changes to the planned analysis were introduced following 
unmasking: 
•  An additional sensitivity analysis of ‘Complete Healing as assessed by the Central Reading Centre’ at 
Week 8 was added post-hoc, which imputed ‘Not completely Healed’ for all treated patients with a missing 
value at Week 8. This amended planned Worst-Case analysis, which imputed only missing values for 
patients who did not discontinue before Week 8. 
•  The endpoint “Time to recurrence” was redefined as “Time to first Intake of Re-Treatment due to 
Recurrence”.  
•  P-values and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for the endpoints Complete Corneal Clearing, 
change in Schirmer’s tear test and change in intraocular pressure as post-hoc analysis. These inferential 
results must be interpreted as purely exploratory.  
GCP findings 
In March 2016, one study site was temporarily suspended by their independent review board for GCP non-
compliance. The suspension was lifted in May 2016 after corrective measures were implemented. The 
Applicant has performed a sensitivity analysis (including/excluding this site’s patients), which were reassuring 
and showed no major impact of these data on the overall study outcome.  
Protocol Deviations 
A total of 57 protocol deviations in 31 patients occurred during the whole study, with 17 classified as major 
and 35 classified as minor. Nineteen deviations occurred at the study site which was suspended for GCP non-
compliance including 5 major deviations concerning 3 patients allocated to rhNGF and 1 patient allocated to 
vehicle who were randomized before they had undergone all study entry procedures. In addition, the patient 
in the vehicle group did not comply with inclusion and criteria.

Age was calculated as the integer part of (Date of Informed Consent – Date of birth)/365.25 
Medical History 
Nearly all patients had a history of other eye disorders (100.0% in the rhNGF group and 95.8% in the vehicle 
group]. The most common were cataract (87.0% and 62.5%, respectively), meibomian gland dysfunction 
(82.6%; 58.3%), dry eye (73.9%; 41.7%) and blepharitis (47.8%; 33.3%). Many had undergone surgical 
procedures on the eye (78.3% and 79.2%), mainly intraocular lens implant (30.4%; 16.7%), amniotic 
membrane graft (21.7%; 12.5%), and cataract operation (13.0% and 20.8%) 
Other common disorders were systemic hypertension (56.5% in the rhNGF group, 54.2% in the vehicle 
group), ophthalmic herpes simplex (39.1% and 20.8%, respectively), anxiety (34.8% and 20.8%),

rosacea (21.7% only in the rhNGF group) and asthma (21.7% only in the rhNGF group). 
Right eye was the study eye in 27 patients (56.3%), left eye in 21 patients (43.8%). Among those, for 
3 patients both eyes were affected. The majority of patients (33 patients; 68.8%) had stage 2 NK including 
15 (62.5%) in the rhNGF group versus 18 (75.0%) in the vehicle group. There were slightly more Stage 3 
patients in the rhNGF group: 9 (37.5%) in the rhNGF group versus 6 (25.0%) in the vehicle group. Mean 
time since NK stage 2, 3 diagnosis was 7.5 (SD: 14.51) in the rhNGF group and 7.9 (SD: 8.59) in the vehicle 
group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/351805/2017

The underlying cause of NK in the study eye was identified primarily as ‘other’ (58.3% in the NGF group and 
41.7% in the vehicle group), dry eye disease (12.5% each), herpes zoster (8.3%; 12.5%) and ocular surgery 
procedure (8.3% each). 
Concomitant Medications 
Most patients had already received prior ophthalmologicals: 91.3% in the rhNGF group and 79.2% in the 
vehicle group. The most common prior medications were: artificial tears (39.1% in the rhNGF group and 
33.3% in the vehicle group), ganciclovir (26.1% only in the rhNGF group), moxifloxacin (17.4% and 25.0%), 
and prednisolone acetate (39.1% and 16.7%). 
Most patients received concomitant ophthalmological medication during the Controlled Treatment Period: 
87.0% in the rhNGF group and 83.3% the vehicle group. The most common were: artificial tears (26.1% and 
29.2%), acyclovir (39.1% and 20.8%), moxifloxacin hydrochloride (30.4% and 20.8%), and prednisolone 
acetate (17.4% and 12.5%).  
The most common concomitant non-ophthalmological medications during the Controlled Treatment Period 
were: cardiovascular drugs, especially agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system (30.4% and 29.2%, 
respectively) and beta-blocking agents (43.5% and 16.7%), analgesics (39.1% and 25.0%), systemic 
antibacterials (43.5% and 16.7%), antihistamines (13.0% and 20.8%), anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic 
products (13.0% and 25.0%), antithrombotic agents (30.4% and 20.8%), antidiabetics (30.4% and 12.5%), 
drugs used for obstructive airway diseases (21.7% and 8.3%), drugs for acid related disorders (17.4% and 
29.2%), lipid-modifying agents (47.8% and 50.0%), psychoanaleptics (34.8% and 37.5%), psycholeptics 
(34.8% and 20.8%), and vitamins (43.5% and 66.7%).  
Concomitant medications were similar in the Uncontrolled Treatment Period. 
Numbers analysed 
A total of 48 were randomized into the study and formed the ITT population including 24 patients in the 
rhNGF group, and 24 patients in vehicle group. The Safety Population consisted of 47 patients including 23 in 
rhNGF and 24 in vehicle control treatment group. One patient in rhNGF group was randomized but then 
immediately discontinued and never treated. 
Outcomes and estimation 
•  Primary efficacy analysis 
There was a statistically significant difference in favour of rhNGF between the percentages of patients 
reaching complete healing as determined by the Central Reading Centre at week 8: 69.6% in the rhNGF-
treated group versus 29.2% in the vehicle-treated group; p=0.006 (see Table 12). 
The results of primary analysis were supported by planned sensitivity analysis, which demonstrated similar 
results. Sensitivity analyses excluding patients from site 09 also showed a statistically significant difference in 
favour of rhNGF for complete healing as determined by the Central Reading Centre: 70.0% (14/20) in the 
rhNGF group versus 25.0% (14/20) in the vehicle group (p=0.004). 
Healing was also reflected by percentage change from baseline in the greatest dimension of PED or corneal 
ulcer. The percentage change (LOCF, ITT) at Week 4 was -80.05% in the rhNGF group versus -47.42% in the 
vehicle group, and at Week 8 - 88.58% in the rhNGF group versus -15.69% in the vehicle group.

•  Secondary efficacy analyses 
Complete healing at 8 weeks as measured by the Investigator 
Completely healed patients (LOCF), as determined by the Investigator, at Week 8 with corneal fluorescein 
staining (ITT population) were 65.2% (15/23) in the rhNGF group, and 29.2% (7/24) in the vehicle group. 
The difference of 36.1% was statistically significant in favour of rhNGF (95%CI: 9.4, 62.7; p=0.013). 
There were furthermore 7 vehicle-treated patients considered to be not completely healed at Week 8 and 6 
vehicle-treated patients who terminated the controlled treatment period prematurely. These 13 patients 
continued into the uncontrolled treatment period with rhNGF 20 μg/ml, and 11 of them completed the 
treatment cycle until Week 16. As photos were not collected for all of these patients in this period, the 
analysis of complete healing as determined by the Central Reading Centre could not be performed. However, 
the investigator’s evaluation concluded that all 11 patients who completed the 8 week treatment cycle with 
rhNGF 20 μg/ml were completely healed at Week 16. 
Complete healing at 4, and 6 weeks as measured by the Central Reading Centre and by the Investigator 
The percentages of patients reaching complete healing of the PED or corneal ulcer (LOCF, ITT) at Week 4 and 
6, as measured by the Central Reviewer, were as follows:  
-  Week 4: 56.5% (13/23) in the rhNGF group versus 37.5% (9/24) in the vehicle group;  
-  Week 6: 56.5% (13/23) in the rhNGF group versus 45.8% (11/24) in the vehicle group.  
The between treatment difference of 19.0% (95% CI: -9.0, 47.1; p=0.191) at Week 4 and 10.7% (95% CI: 
 17.7, 39.1; p=0.464) was no statistically significant. 
The percentages of patients reaching complete healing of the PED or corneal ulcer (LOCF, ITT) at Week 4 and 
6, as Determined by the Investigator, were as follows:  
-  Week 4: 56.5% (13/23) in the rhNGF group versus 41.7% (10/24) in the vehicle group;  
-  Week 6: 65.2% (15/23) in the rhNGF group versus 41.7% (10/24) in the vehicle group.  
Assessment report  
EMA/351805/2017 
Page 68/104 
 
  
  
 
  
The between treatment difference of 14.9% (95% CI: -13.4, 43.1; p=0.308) at Week 4 and 23.6% (95% CI: 
-4.2, 51.3; p=0.106) was no statistically significant. 
Complete corneal clearing at weeks 4, 6, and 8 defined as grade 0 on the modified Oxford scale 
The percentages of patients with complete corneal clearing, defined as grade 0 on the modified Oxford scale, 
at Weeks 4, 6, and 8, were as follows: 
-  Baseline: 8.3% (2/24) in the rhNGF group versus no patients (0%) in the vehicle group; 
-  Week 4: 13.6% (3/22) in the rhNGF group versus 4.2% (1/24) in the vehicle group; 
-  Week 6: 9.1% (2/22) in the rhNGF group versus 8.3% (2/24) in the vehicle group; 
-  Week 8: 22.7% (5/22) in the rhNGF group versus 4.2% (1/24) in the vehicle group. 
A post-hoc analysis showed no statistically significant difference between the two treatment groups at week 4 
and week 6 (p=0.255 and p=0.927, respectively) but there was a trend in favour of rhNGF at 
week 8 (p=0.062) 
Mean change in BCDVA from baseline to Week 8 
For the study eye, mean BCDVA at baseline was substantially higher in the vehicle group than in rhNGF group 
(17.6 letters versus 8.3 letters). Vision slightly improved in both arms by Week 8, but there was no 
statistically significant difference between the two treatments (p=0.745).

Best Corrected Distance Visual Acuity consists of letters read at 4m only. 
[1] Analysis results from an ANCOVA with treatment as factor controlling for baseline value, time since diagnosis of NK 
(months) and baseline value of Schirmer test (mm) 
Only few patients achieved a 15 letter gain in BCDVA at Week 8: 13.0% (3/23) in the rhNGF group versus 
16.7% (4/24) in the vehicle group. There was no statistically significant difference between the two 
treatment groups (p=0.727).  
Corneal sensitivity as measured by the Cochet-Bonnet aesthesiometer  
Corneal sensitivity inside PED or ulcer at baseline was 0.81 in rhNGF group and 0.65 in the vehicle group. At 
Week 8, corneal sensitivity inside PED or ulcer was 2.91 in the rhNGF group and 1.83 in the vehicle group. 
The adjusted mean change (SD) from baseline in corneal sensitivity were 1.88 (1.401) in the rhNGF group

and 1.00 (1.254) in the vehicle group. The between treatment difference 0f 0.6 was not statistically 
significant (95% CI: -0.4, 1.5; p=0.207). 
Deterioration in stage 2 or 3 NK from baseline  
The percentage of patients with deterioration from baseline at weeks 1 to 8 ranged from 0.0% (none) patient 
to 10.0% in the rhNGF group and from 5.9% to 25.0% in the vehicle group. A total 6 patients in the rhNGF 
group and 11 patients in the vehicle arm experienced deterioration during the active phase of treatment. 
Statistically significant differences between the treatments were seen at Week 2 (p= 0.023), but not at Week 
1 (p=0.446), Week 3 (p= 0.077), Week 4 (p=0.647), Week 6 (p=0.112) or Week 8 (p=0.110) 
Investigator global evaluation  
Investigator global evaluation was compared at the Week 4 and Week 8 time point. Amongst the patients 
without missing data, the ratings of “very satisfactory” and “satisfactory”, combined, were assigned to 
18/19 rhNGF patients (94.7%) versus 11/16 vehicle patients (68.8%) at Week 4 (p=0.111), and in 14/18 
rhNGF patients (77.8%) versus 8/15 vehicle patients (53.3%) at Week 8 (p=0.164). 
Completely staining free (no corneal fluorescein staining in the area of the corneal lesion and non-persistent 
lesions elsewhere in the cornea) as assessed by Central Reading Centre 
At Week 4, 56.5% (13/23) of patients in the rhNGF group were completely healed compared to 33.3% (8/24) 
in the vehicle group (p=0.11). At Week 8, 65.2% (15/23) of patients in the rhNGF group were completely 
healed compared to 16.7% (4/24) in the vehicle group (p<0.001). 
Summary of Re-treatment due to Recurrence 
Data were available for 14 patients who received rhNGF during the controlled treatment period, and were 
completely healed at the last controlled treatment period visit. Of these.14.3% (2/14=14.3%) were treated 
for recurrence. 
Data were available for 10 patients who received vehicle during the controlled treatment period and rhNGF 
during the uncontrolled treatment period, and were completely healed at the last uncontrolled treatment 
period visit. Of these, 30.0% (3/10=30.0%) were treated for recurrence. 
In the 7 patients who received vehicle during the controlled treatment period, and who did not undergo 
uncontrolled treatment, none was treated for recurrence.

2.5.2.5.  Analysis performed across trials  
NGF0212 and NGF0214 Inter-Study Analysis 
An inter-study comparison was performed for studies NGF0212 (rhNGF and vehicle both without methionine, 
Phase II) and NGF0214 (rhNGF and vehicle both with added methionine). The comparison aimed at 
evaluating efficacy and safety of 20 μg/ml 6 times a day of rhNGF eye drops solution formulation containing 
methionine compared to 20 μg/ml rhNGF eye drops formulation without methionine 6 times a day. The study 
group receiving 10 μg/ml rhNGF in study NGF0212 was not considered for the inter-study analysis. 
The primary efficacy variable for the inter-study comparison was complete healing of the PED or corneal ulcer 
determined by corneal fluorescein staining at the end of controlled treatment period (8 weeks) as determined 
by the Central Reading Centre evaluating the clinical picture. Patients, who discontinued before Week 4 (and 
who did not have a post-baseline corneal photography with fluorescein), were assumed to have been ‘Not 
Completely Healed’ for primary efficacy endpoint if the Investigator recorded that the ‘measurement are N/A 
because of the greatest dimension of the PED or corneal ulcer evaluated was greater than 1 mm on the slit 
lamp’. If no post-baseline values were available, no imputation was performed, the patient was assumed to 
have a missing 'Completely Healed’ endpoint and was not included in the analysis. The analyses were 
performed on the safety population. 
In addition to the NGF0212/ NGF0214 inter-study SAP, the results of the 2 studies were also compared for 
corneal clearing in line with an additional analysis (where corneal healing was defined as “no corneal 
fluorescein staining in the area of the PED or corneal ulcer, and non-persistent lesions in the surrounding 
area of the cornea"). This was a post-hoc analysis for study NGF0212, whereas the analysis was included 
with an addendum to the SAP for study NGF0214 prior to database lock and unblinding. The results are 
shown in previous sections 2.5.2.2. and 2.5.2.3.  
Results 
Across the two studies, overall, 115/152 (75.7%) patients completed the controlled 8 week treatment period; 
32 (21.1%) were withdrawn and 118 (77.6%) entered the follow-up period. The withdrawal rate was 
identical (25%) in the two rhNGF arms with and without methionine (6/24 patients in study NGF0214 
[+methionine] and 13/52 patients in study NGF0212 [-methionine]), whereas it was higher in the vehicle 
arm with methionine as compared to the vehicle arm without methionine (9/24 [37.5%] vs 4/52 [7.7%]).  
Patient demographics and baseline characteristics were overall comparable between the 4 treatment groups. 
Overall, there were more patients in study NGF0212 (vehicle and 20 μg/ml rhNGF) that had stage 3 NK 
(49/104 [47.1%] compared to study NGF0214 (15/47 [31.9%]). At the same time, patients in NGF0212 had 
a shorter average disease period (27.3 months) compared to a mean of 32.7 months for patients in study 
NGF0214. 
Furthermore, during the controlled treatment period, comparatively more patients in study NGF0214 than in 
study NGF0212 took concomitant ocular preparations: 82.6% in the rhNGF + methionine arm and 75.0% in 
the vehicle + methionine arm versus 50.0% in the rhNGF arm and 40.4% in the vehicle arm.

Primary endpoint: Complete Corneal Healing at Week 8 as Assessed by the Central Reading Centre 
The percentage of patients that achieved complete healing at Week 8 was similar for the rhNGF 20 μg/ml 
group in both studies and was significantly higher compared to the vehicle group, as shown in Table 16. The 
odds ratio (NGF0212/NGF0214) was 1.47 (95% CI: 0.73; 2.94). Sensitivity analyses with respect to handling 
of missing data showed similar results and confirmed the robustness of the data.

Abbreviations: CI = confidence interval; ITT = intent-to-treat; LOCF = last observation carried forward; M = methionine; 
rhNGF = recombinant human nerve growth factor 
Results after 4 weeks of treatment revealed a difference between active and vehicle groups of 38% 
(NGF0212) and 19% (NGF0214), respectively, resulting in an OR of 0.71 (95% CI: 0.36; 1.44).  
Post-hoc pooled analysis by disease severity (stage 2 and 3) 
In response to a request by the CHMP, in order to investigate consistency of the effect by disease severity 
stage, the applicant presented pooled data by disease stage at baseline.  In the Phase II segment of study 
NGF0212, 76 patients (49%) had stage 2 NK and 80 patients (51%) had Stage 3 NK. In study NGF0214, 33 
patients (69%) had stage 2 NK and 15 patients (31%) had stage 3 NK. 
When pooling all patients who received rhNGF in study NGF0212 and NGF0214, 37 out of 60 (62%) patients 
with stage 2 NK and 53 out of 64 (83%) patients with stage 3 NK achieved epithelial closure at the end of the 
8 weeks controlled treatment period. By pooling all patients who received vehicle in the two studies, 15 out 
of 46 (33%) patients with stage 2 NK and 14 out of 29 (48%) patients with stage 3 NK achieved epithelial 
closure at the end of the 8 weeks controlled treatment period. The difference between rhNGF and vehicle was 
statistically significant in both stage 2 (p=0.003) and stage 3 (p<0.001) disease. When only considering 
patients who received rhNGF 20 µg/ml in the two studies, 25 out of 40 (63%) patients with stage 2 NK and 
28 out of 33 (85%) patients with stage 3 NK achieved epithelial closure at the end of the 8 weeks controlled 
treatment period. This difference versus vehicle maintained statistical significance in both stage 2 (p=0.006) 
and stage 3 (p=0.002) disease.

2.5.2.6.  Supportive study(ies) 
Prior to the initiation of the clinical development program for Oxervate, reports from open-label, uncontrolled 
clinical trials using native mNGF in the form of eye drops had been published in the scientific literature. Two 
studies by Bonini et al. (2000) and Lambiase et al. (2007) using 200 μg/ml mNGF eye drops are briefly 
summarised. 
Bonini et al. (2000) reported on 43 patients (45 eyes) with moderate (stage 2, n=17) to severe (stage 3, 
n=8) neurotrophic keratitis unresponsive to other nonsurgical therapies, who were treated with mNGF 
(200 mg/ml) every 2 hours for 2 days followed by one drop six times daily. Patients were treated until the 
defect had resolved and thereafter continued on a maintenance dose of one drop mNGF (100 mg/ml) four 
times daily for 2 weeks.  
The mean duration of the follow-up period was 15.8 ± 11.5 months (9.1 ± 7.2 months in stage 2 and 19.9 ± 
11.7 months in stage 3). All patients had a complete resolution of the PED (with or without an ulcer). 
Complete epithelial healing was observed after approximately 1 month of treatment (26.6 ± 9.0 days in 
stage 2; 22.8 ± 10.0 days in stage 3). Furthermore, a corneal sensitivity test was performed by touching the 
patient’s central corneal zone with the tip of a cotton swab. Following treatment with mNGF, corneal 
sensitivity was improved in 59% of the eyes with stage 2 keratitis and in 89% of the eyes with stage 3 NK. 
Visual acuity was also significantly improved at the end of the follow-up period from BCVA 18/300 ± 18/200 
to BCVA 20/55 ± 20/100 (p< 0.001) in patients with stage 2 keratitis and from BCVA 10/300 ± 10/300 to 
BCVA 20/50 ± 20/80 (p<0.001) in patients with stage 3 keratitis. The improvement in visual acuity in 
patients with stage 3 was significantly correlated to the duration of follow-up (rho 5 0.602; p<0.001). 
Lambiase et al. (2007) studied further 11 patients (13 eyes) affected by NK unresponsive to conventional 
therapies primarily with a view to investigate anti-NGF antibody development. All patients presented with a 
neurotrophic corneal ulcer, stromal involvement and complete corneal anaesthesia. Patients were treated 
with mNGF eye drops (same dosing schedule as in Bonini et al., 2000). All patients had complete resolution 
of the corneal ulcer after 26 ± 11 days of treatment with mNGF (mea ± SD; range: 9–43 days). The mean 
follow-up was 33 ± 16 months (range: 16–72 months). In 2 patients an ulcer recurred after two months and 
6 months, respectively, and healed after 2-3 weeks of mNGF treatment. Corneal sensitivity improved to 
hypoesthesia in all the eyes and was maintained until the last follow up visit. When compared with the values 
at base line, BCVA significantly improved at the end of follow up in all the eyes (mean± SD, 0.11 ± 0.13 
versus 0.30 ± 0.23; p<0.05). 
Overall, therapeutic efficacy was independent from the underlying cause of NK as patients with different 
aetiologies showed a similar response. Side effects were in both studies only local, mild and transient (within 
a follow-up period of 18-72 months). 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The evidence of the efficacy of rhNFG (cenegermin) eye drop solution in the treatment of stage 2 and 3 NK 
was mainly derived from data of two randomized, vehicle controlled, double-masked, parallel group clinical 
trials, study NGF0212 (Phase II) and study NGF0214.  
During the clinical development, the eye drop solution formulation was changed and L-methionine was added 
as an anti-oxidant due to concerns that oxidation could have affected the stability of rhNGF in the previous 
formulation. Only patients included in study NGF0214 received the L-methionine formulation proposed to be 
marketed. An integrated comparison of study NGF0212 and NGF0214 was provided in order to support 
Assessment report  
EMA/351805/2017 
Page 77/104 
 
  
  
comparability of the L-methionine free and L-methionine containing formulation. Only the 20 µg/ml dose 
strength was included in the comparison, as this dose was evaluated in both efficacy studies and is proposed 
for commercial use. The approach had previously been agreed by CHMP in a scientific advice whereby a 
formal bridging study to investigate differences between the two formulations was considered unfeasible. 
Finally, the applicant informed that a new clinical study (NGF0215) in the intended indication is planned to be 
conducted with the rhNGF 20 μg/ml with methionine formulation. This study will provide additional data on 
the prolonged use of rhNGF eye drops in a subset of NK patients who were not completely healed after 
8 weeks of treatment.  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The selection of the rhNGF target dose and dosing schedule (20 μg/ml rhNGF, 6 drops/eye/day for 8 weeks) 
to be investigated in the Phase II studies was based on results from in vitro and in vivo non-clinical studies, 
in-vitro human biomaterial studies and reports on mNGF in the scientific literature. In study NGF0212 a lower 
dose of 10 μg/ml rhNGF was also included to explore the dose response relationship. Doses higher than 
20 μg/ml rhNGF were tested during Phase I but only for safety (tolerability) purposes. The rationale for the 
dose selection was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
Both Phase II studies were similar in design (randomised, double-masked, parallel-group), patient 
populations and endpoints, which had previously been agreed by the CHMP in the context of scientific advice 
and protocol assistance. Adult patients with moderate and severe clinical stage of NK were recruited, i.e. 
those with PED (NK stage 2) or with corneal ulcer (NK stage 3) and documented decreased corneal sensitivity 
of at least moderate severity. Further criteria of severity, such as refractoriness to previous treatment and 
reduction of visual acuity were considered reasonable to define a patient population in need of treatment and 
unlikely to experience spontaneous healing. 
The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients experiencing complete healing, defined as the greatest 
diameter of CFS in the area of the PED or corneal ulcer being less than 0.5 mm, as determined by the 
reading centre. The primary endpoint was assessed after 4 weeks (study NGF0212) or 8 weeks (study 
NGF0214) of treatment. Secondary endpoints were complementary and included further responder analyses 
of complete healing or corneal clearing, time to corneal healing, as well as improvement in visual acuity and 
corneal sensitivity and percentage of patients experiencing deterioration. Overall, the choice of endpoints was 
considered acceptable. 
After an 8 week-controlled treatment phase, patients entered a follow-up phase of either 48 weeks (study 
NGF0212) or 24 weeks (study NGF0214) duration. Patients initially assigned to vehicle received active 
treatment from week 8 to week 16 if they were not completely healed at week 8. All patients were eligible for 
another course of treatment in the event of recurrence during the follow-up period. Given that NK patients 
may require long-term/repeated treatment, data from the follow-up periods were considered highly relevant 
to comprehensively assess the efficacy of Oxervate. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Study NGF0212  
Phase II of study NGF0212 recruited a total of 156 patients (52 patients in each of the 3 treatment arms). A 
total of 109 patients (69.9%) entered the 48-week follow-up period. A rather high number of patients

withdrew from the study and did not continue until the need of the follow-up period: 24 patients withdrew at 
Week 8 (7/52 in rhNGF 10 µg/ml, 13/52 in rhNGF 20 µg/ml, 4/52 in vehicle arm) and 18 additional patients 
during the follow-up phase (8 in rhNGF 10 µg/ml, 3 in rhNGF 20 µg/ml, 7 in vehicle arm). Most of the 
withdrawals occurred in the active groups were reported to be due to adverse events and in the case of the 
high dose group many of these took place early during the 8-week controlled period of treatment (see section 
2.6.1. for the discussion of safety). The CHMP noted the low retention rate in the study. The additional 
analyses based on observed cases, using imputation of missing data as failures or multiple imputation 
method were considered sufficient to address the possible impact on the study outcome (see below).  
Overall, treatment groups were well balanced with respect to demographic and baseline characteristics. There 
were slightly more women than men (60 and 40% of the total population). Nearly half of the enrolled 
patients were diagnosed with to Stage 2 (48.7%) and the remainder with Stage 3 (51.3%) NK. Patients in 
the rhNGF 10 µg/ml dose group included a higher percentage of severe (stage 3) patients compared to 
rhNGF 20 µg/ml and vehicle [31/52 (59.6%), 25/51 (48.1%) and 24/52 (46.2%)]. Patients reported a wide 
spectrum of aetiologies as cause of NK.  
After 4 weeks of treatment 67 of the 156 patients treated achieved complete healing of the corneal lesion as 
determined by the Reading Centre (primary endpoint). Patients on 20 μg/ml dose reached the highest rate of 
cure (58%; 29/52) and slightly less patients treated with 10 μg/ml (54.9%, 28/52) achieved complete 
corneal healing. In comparison, complete healing was achieved by 10 out of 52 of patients in the vehicle 
group (19.6%). The difference of 38.4% and 35.3%, respectively, was statistically significant (p<0.001). At 
the end of the 8 week treatment period, there was an increase in the rates of completely healed patients in 
all three treatment arms. Significantly more subjects receiving either rhNGF 10 or 20 μg/ml than those 
treated with the vehicle achieved complete corneal healing [38 patients (74.5%) in the rhNGF 10 μg/ml 
group, 37 (74.0%) in the rhNGF 20 μg/ml group, and 22 (43.1%) in the vehicle control; p=0.001 and 
0.002]. No statistically significant differences between doses were observed at either time point. The results 
from other analyses conducted (observed case analysis, sensitivity analyses) were in line with the primary 
analysis. Likewise, the results for corneal healing measured by the clinical investigator were consistent with 
the cure rates observed by the Reading Centre, thus supporting robustness of the primary study outcome. 
The CHMP considered the improvement in corneal surface integrity over 4 and 8 weeks to be clinically 
meaningful in a patient population with impaired wound healing at risk of corneal perforation and loss of eye 
sight. The observed increase in the responder rate (31-38%) with rhNGF compared to vehicle provided 
robust support of a clinically relevant treatment benefit of rhNGF.  
By comparison, uncontrolled studies conducted with topically administered mNGF reported a complete 
treatment response (healing) in all the study participants (Bonini et al., 2000; Lambiase et al., 2007). 
However, in these studies treatment was administered until healing. This raised the question if some patients 
may obtain further benefit from prolonged treatment. Notably, in study NGF0212, the corneal defect had 
healed in a total of 67 patients by Week 4 and in 97 patients by Week 8 (i.e. 30 additional patients from 
Week 4 to 8). An extended treatment period beyond 8 weeks was not investigated and it is thus not known if 
some patients would have benefited from continued treatment. The CHMP recommended that the planned 
study NGF0215 should aim to address this question. 
Results for complete corneal clearing, i.e. Grade 0 staining on the Oxford scale after instillation of fluorescein, 
numerically also favoured active treatments over control (20.8%, 19.5% and 7.1% responders for rhNGF 10 
μg/ml, rhNGF 20 μg/ml, and vehicle, respectively) although the difference was not statistically significant 
(p=0.065 and p= 0.097). 
Assessment report  
EMA/351805/2017 
Page 79/104 
 
  
  
Furthermore, long-term data showed that the majority of patients healed at Week 8 after rhNGF treatment, 
remained healed during the 48-week follow-up period (83% of patients in the rhNGF 10 µg/ml group and 
80%in the rhNGF 20 µg/ml group with a response available). This was overall supportive of maintenance of 
the effect. Additional long-term data are expected to be generated post-approval with study NGF0215. 
Compared to vehicle, complete healing was achieved earlier in the active groups, with a median time of 
29 days (95% CI: 20, 55), 28 days (95% CI: 19, 55), and 56 days (95% CI: 42, not estimable), in the 
rhNGF 10 μg/ml group, 20 μg/ml group, and vehicle control group, respectively. However, due to the 
exploratory nature of this variable, these results should be considered with caution.   
Only few patients experienced deterioration, i.e. increase of the size or depth of the corneal lesion, decrease 
of visual acuity or presence of corneal infection, with a trend in favour of active treatment with less patients 
worsening compared to vehicle.  
With regards to visual acuity, patients presented with severe impairment of vision (mean BCDVA between 
24.2-32.4 letters), which was slightly worse in the 20 μg/ml dose group compared to the other two study 
arms. A trend towards an improvement in vision over time was shown in all 3 treatment groups. At Week 8, 
the mean improvement in BCDVA was 15.8 letters for rhNGF 10 μg/ml and 11.9 letters for rhNGF 20 μg/ml 
and 6.9 letters for vehicle. Only the difference between the 10 μg/ml dose and vehicle was statistically 
significant (p=0.022). The proportion of rhNGF patients who gained at least 15 letters in BCDVA by Week 8 
was 50% (24/48) in the 10 μg/ml dose arm and 41.5% (17/41) in the 20 μg/ml dose arm, which represent a 
27.5% (p=0.008) and 19.0% (p=0.068) increase, respectively, over vehicle (22.5%, 9/40).  The trend 
towards a clinical improvement in vision was acknowledged by the CHMP. However, the lack of statistical 
significance of the between treatment difference of rhNGF 20 μg/ml versus vehicle created uncertainty with 
regards to the true benefit of rhNGF treatment.  
Similar to the finding for visual acuity, corneal sensitivity improved in all three study groups, with only a 
small numerical advantage being apparent in the active treatments compared to vehicle.  
It is possible that residual corneal damage which had not completely healed at the time of assessment may 
have delayed or restricted improvements of functional outcomes and that both vision and corneal sensitivity 
will continue to improve over time. However, while the improvement in vision achieved by Week 8 persisted 
in the follow-up period, no further improvement in vision was observed during the 48-week extension phase. 
Results from the 48-week extension period also showed slightly more patients on rhNGF (both doses) than on 
vehicle with an improvement or no change in corneal sensitivity. While this finding was in favour of rhNGF, 
the response definition (improvement or no change in corneal sensitivity) did not distinguish those patients 
who experienced a real gain in corneal sensitivity. Furthermore, no trend of further improvement in corneal 
sensation over time was observed. Whether additional functional improvements could be achieved with 
longer or repeated courses of rhNGF treatment remained unclear at the time of this report.  
When comparing the two rhNGF doses tested in study NGF0212, both appeared to have similar efficacy 
profiles. The applicant stated that, while there were no statistically significant differences between the 
10 μg/ml and the 20 μg/ml doses, there were some endpoints which showed a trend towards better efficacy 
for the higher dose, e.g. the number of patients with corneal healing at Week 4, and the number of patients 
with residual fluorescein staining following complete healing in study NGF0212. However, the opposite is true 
for other endpoints and no clear advantage of the 20 μg/ml strength over 10 μg/ml could be deducted from 
the study data. The CHMP acknowledged that the efficacy studies were not designed or powered to show a 
statistically significant difference between the dosing groups. Given that efficacy of the 20 μg/ml strength has 
been established including in the context of the commercial formulation containing L-methionine (see study 
Assessment report  
EMA/351805/2017 
Page 80/104 
 
  
  
NGF0214 below) and subject to the assessment of the safety profiles of the two doses (see section 2.6. ), the 
CHMP considered the applicant’s choice of rhNGF 20 μg/ml acceptable. 
Study NGF0214 
A total of 48 patients were randomized in this study (24 patients in the rhNGF 20 μg/ml and 24 patients in 
the vehicle group). A total of 33 patients completed the controlled treatment period: 18 patients (75%) in the 
rhNGF 20 μg/ml group and 15 patients (62.5%) in the vehicle control group. Most of the withdrawals 
occurred in the active group and were due to adverse events (4 out of 6). In the vehicle group 6 out of 
9 patients terminated prematurely and entered the uncontrolled treated period.  
Similar to study NGF0212, females represented approximately 60% of the population. The treatment groups 
were similar with regards to demographic characteristics and NK aetiology. The majority of patients had 
developed stage 2 (68.8%) and there were slightly more stage 3 patients in the rhNGF group (9; 37.5%) 
compared to vehicle (6; 25.0%).  
After 8 weeks of treatment 23 of 48 patients achieved complete healing of the corneal lesion as determined 
by the Reading Centre (primary endpoint): 16/23 patients on rhNGF (69.6%) and 7/24 patients receiving 
vehicle (29.2%). The difference of 40.4% was statistically significant (p=0.006). Cure rates determined at 
Week 4 as well as when assessed by the investigator were overall consistent with findings for the primary 
endpoint, although the between-treatment difference was less pronounced at Week 4 compared to Week 8. 
Furthermore, complete corneal clearing (zero staining) was achieved in more patients on rhNGF that on 
vehicle (22.7% versus. 4.2%), although the difference did not reach statistical significance (p=0.062). 
Overall few, but more patients receiving rhNGF than those in the vehicle group experienced disease 
deterioration.  
Similar to study NGF0212, little or no improvement was observed in functional outcomes at the end of the 
treatment period. Patients in both treatment arms improved in visual acuity, but no advantage of rhNGF 
compared to vehicle was observed (mean change in BCDVA from baseline 4.48 letters vs. 4.33 letters, 
respectively). Corneal sensitivity was numerically better in the rhNGF group than in the vehicle group but the 
clinical relevance of the difference in the mean change from baseline at Week 8 (0.6 cm) was uncertain. At 
the end of treatment all patients remained within the range of the qualification criteria of 
hypoesthesia/anaesthesia at study entry, i.e. ≤4 cm measured with the Cochet-Bonnet aesthesiometer. 
Inter-study comparison NGF0212/NGF0214 
Demographic and baseline characteristics suggest that the populations of both studies using L-methionine 
free (NGF0212) and L-methionine containing (NGF0214) eye drop formulations, respectively, were similar. 
Both studies included patients with different disease severity (stage 2 and 3) and a wide spectrum of 
aetiologies as cause of NK. When comparing disease severity, patients from study NGF0212 appeared to have 
been slightly more severely affected than in study NGF0214 (47.1% versus 31.9% of stage 3 patients). While 
these factors could be expected to have impact on the treatment response to rhNGF, subgroup analyses for 
stage 2 and 3 disease and by main NK aetiologies showed no relevant differences in cure rates.  
The two studies differed in the inclusion criteria with regards to involvement of the contralateral eye. Only 
study NGF0214 allowed the entry of patients with both eyes affected. However, only 3 patients were enrolled 
with both affected eyes which was not considered of relevance for the study outcome. 
In both studies, the response rates in the vehicle arms were rather large. The applicant argued that good 
patient management according to best standard of care including close monitoring as applied during the 
study is known to help corneal healing and the response rates were in line with the estimated rates used for  
Assessment report  
EMA/351805/2017 
Page 81/104 
 
  
  
study size and power calculations (approximately 30%). While this justification was considered acceptable, 
the CHMP noted a difference in the response rates for patients in the vehicle arms with and without 
methionine. At Week 8, only 7/24 (29.2%) of the patients receiving vehicle in study NGF0214 had achieved 
complete corneal healing compared to 22/52 (43.1%) in study NGF0212. Furthermore, when comparing the 
2 studies, it emerged that more patients receiving vehicle with methionine withdrew prematurely during the 
active 8 week treatment phase, needed treatment during the uncontrolled period and reported adverse 
events (see also discussion on clinical safety in section 2.6. ). The applicant was of the view that this 
discrepancy was unlikely due to a detrimental effect of the excipient. Rather, the result of this indirect 
comparison of two studies, one of which was conducted in the US and the other in Europe, may reflect 
cultural differences including clinical practice, perception of and ability to describe symptoms, patients’ 
willingness to participate in trials, etc. Regional difference in the prescribing patterns were also considered 
the main reason for the difference in reported previous treatment with artificial tears or other lubricants (less 
than 40% of patients in study NGF0214 compared to 96.1% in study NGF0212). In general, prevalence, 
diagnosis and therapeutic approach differ in the US and Europe, which may be relevant to the treatment of 
this condition. In this context, additional analyses presented by the applicant were reassuring, showing that 
use of concomitant medication did not affect the treatment effect of rhNGF. The CHMP considered the 
explanations satisfactory. 
Overall, the inter-study analyses supported the efficacy conclusions from the individual studies. Positive and 
consistent results have been observed with regards to corneal healing in patients after 8 weeks of treatment 
with rhNGF 20 µg/ml. The difference in cure rate for rhNGF 20 µg/ml with respect to vehicle was 31% and 
40% at week 8, for studies NFG0212 and NFG0214, respectively (OR: 1.47[0.73-2.94]). Results from the 
initial 4 weeks of treatment were also reassuring although less consistent across studies (difference between 
active and vehicle groups were 38% and 19% (OR: 0.71 [0.36-1.44] in study NGF0212 and NGF0214).  
Importantly, no major discrepancies between disease progressions as a potential reflection of a deleterious 
effect on the cornea of methionine have been observed. Thus, while some uncertainties remained given the 
limited experience with this excipient in topical eye products (see also discussion on clinical safety in section 
2.6. ), the CHMP considered that the methionine-containing formulation could be acceptable from an efficacy 
point of view given that a clear treatment benefit with this formulation has been shown. Additional long-term 
data with the commercial formulation are expected to be generated post-approval in study NGF0215. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In conclusion, the available clinical date demonstrate a clear benefit of an 8-week treatment course with 
Oxervate in re-establishing ocular surface integrity in patients with stage 2 and 3 NK. The observed 
difference of 30-40% in the rate of corneal healing with respect to vehicle control represents robust proof of 
a clinically meaningful treatment benefit, as corneal health reduces the risk of eye perforation and potential 
sight loss. Long-term data were overall supportive, showing maintenance of the treatment effect in the vast 
majority of patients up to 1 year. Furthermore, a trend in favour of rhNGF over vehicle in improving visual 
acuity was observed, although some uncertainties regarding functional outcomes remained. The CHMP 
recommended that the applicant pursued the plans for an additional study (NGF0215) to generate further 
long-term data with the commercial, methionine-containing formulation, to help address the remaining 
uncertainties with the use of Oxervate including (functional) long-term outcomes and a possible additional 
benefit of prolonged treatment.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
For the purpose of the safety evaluation, safety data from the clinical development programme were 
aggregated in three separate pools: 
- 
the  Primary  Safety  Pool,  which  included  data  in  patients  with  stage  2  and  3  NK  from  studies  NGF0212 
(European population) and NGF0214 (US population); 
- 
the  Secondary  Safety  Pool  comprising  all  5  studies  with  rhNGF  sponsored  by  the  applicant  (see  table  2) 
including data from the two trials in NK patients, one trial in healthy volunteers, one in moderate-severe 
dry eye disease and another one in retinitis pigmentosa with higher dose and longer duration of treatment 
in other indications.  
The Primary Safety Pool was the main basis for the safety assessment, with other data being considered as 
supportive. All analyses were based on the Safety Set, i.e. all randomized patients who received at least one 
dose of study medication, with patients summarized according to the actual treatment received.  
In addition to the safety analysis based on pooled study data, a comparative safety analysis was conducted 
based on data from study NGF0212, in which two different doses of rhNGF were compared. Data from study 
NGF0212 and NGF0214 were furthermore compared to assess the safety of a methionine-free versus a 
methionine-containing eye drops formulation.  
Pooled data analyses were based on the available data at the time of database lock for this application. 
Databases of studies NGF0212 and NGF0214 were locked after 3 months and 4 weeks follow-up, 
respectively. Data for the full follow up periods (12 months for study NGF0212 and 6 months for study 
NGF0214) were provided in response to a CHMP request during the course of this procedure.  
In addition to the review of adverse event (AE) reporting and laboratory results for haematology, clinical 
chemistry, and vital signs, the following ocular assessments were conducted: visual analogue scale (VAS) for 
ocular tolerability, BCDVA, intraocular pressure (IOP), and dilated fundus ophthalmoscopy. AEs were coded 
using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 15.1. 
In the pivotal trials, an adverse drug reaction was defined as an untoward and unintended response to an 
investigational medicinal product related to any dose administered. The definition implied a reasonable 
possibility of a causal relationship between the event and the investigational medicinal product. 
Relationship/causality of an AE to study drug was assessed by the investigator using the following terms: 
none (intercurrent event), unlikely (remote), possible, probable, or highly probable. 
Patient exposure 
A total of 315 subjects were exposed to rhNGF at any concentration/dose (see Table 17). Of these, 177 were 
NK patients, whereby only 82 (59 in phase II segment of study NGF0212 and 23 in study NGF0214) were 
treated with the concentration proposed for commercial use (20 µg/ml, 6 drops per day in the affected eye). 
Furthermore, only 23 patients from study NGF214 were treated with the proposed formulation containing 
methionine as an excipient. There were some additional data available from patients initially assigned to 
vehicle, who did not heal during the 8-week double-blind period and subsequently received rhNGF during 
Week 8-16 (23 and 13 additional patients from study NGF0212 and NGF0214).  
Assessment report  
EMA/351805/2017 
Page 83/104 
 
  
  
Furthermore, during the follow-up period, a total of 18 patients had unscheduled exposure to study 
treatment following a recurrence of PED or corneal ulcer including 13 patients in study NGF0212 (6 patients 
in the rhNGF 10 μg/ml group and 7 patients in the rhNGF 20 μg/ml group) and 5 patients in study NGF0214.

pts= patients 
a Patients treated with 20 μg/ml rhNGF or vehicle in NGF0212 (Phase II segment) and in NGF0214 
b Patients treated with rhNGF or Vehicle in all clinical studies conducted 
In patients with NK, the treatment duration was 8 weeks, whereas the treatment duration for subjects 
enrolled in other clinical trials ranged from 4 to 24 weeks. All NK patients included were adults. The majority 
were white with more than 60% being women. The average age ranged between 60 and 70 years for the 
Primary Safety Pool. Patients from the Secondary Safety Pool were younger with a mean age ranging from 35 
to 52.1 years reflecting the different indications included in this Pool. 
As for disease characteristics for the Primary Safety Pool (clinical trials in NK population), the main cause of 
NK  was  herpes  simplex  infection.  Dry  eye  and  surgery  were  other  common  causes.  The  difference  in 
percentage  of  patients  with  stage  3  of  the  disease  (47.1%  in  study  NGF0212  versus  31.9%  in  study 
NGF0214)  suggests  that  patients  from  study  NGF0212  were  slightly  more  severely  affected.  Time  from 
diagnosis  was  very  similar  in  both  studies  (27  and  32  months,  respectively)  while  time  since  diagnosis  of 
stage 2 or 3 was double for study NGF0212 (16 versus 7.8 months respectively) what would be in line with 
the more advanced disease of NGF0212 patients. See section 2.5.2.2. and 2.5.2.3. for further details. 
Adverse events 
Primary Safety Pool 
Table 18 provides an overview of the AEs observed in the Primary Safety Pool during the 8 weeks controlled 
treatment period.

During the Controlled Treatment Period - Safety Population 
Key: μg = microgram(s); ml = millilitre(s); n = number of patients in a particular category; N = number of patients 
in Safety population; rhNGF = recombinant human nerve growth factor. 
Data  for  the  controlled  phase  of  the  studies  (see  table  above)  suggest  a  worse  adverse  safety  profile  for 
patients receiving methionine-containing eye drops (both vehicle and rhNGF). Patients receiving vehicle plus 
methionine  (study  NGF0214)  experienced  a  higher  rate  of  AEs  compared  to  those  receiving  vehicle  alone 
(study NGF0212): patients with at least 1 AE (75% versus 38.5%), patients with at least 1 severe AE (16.7% 
versus 9.6%), patients with at least 1 AE leading to discontinuation (29.2% versus 7.7%) and patients with 
at  least  1  AE  in  relation  to  the  study  drug  (33.3%  versus  19.2%).  Similarly,  for  patients  on  rhNGF  plus 
methionine  compared  to  those  on  rhNGF  alone  higher  percentages  of  patients  with  at  least  1  AE  (91.3% 
versus 51.9%) and with at least 1 AE in relation to the study drug (43.5% versus 17.3%) were observed.  
Data  for  the  uncontrolled  phase  of  the  studies  were  too  limited  in  the  pooled  analyses  (due  to  the  early 
database lock) to draw any sound conclusions (see long-term safety section below). 
A  summary  of  AEs  (occurring  in  ≥5%  of  patients  in  either  study  overall  by  preferred  term)  for  the  Safety 
population is presented in Table 19 for the controlled treatment period.

The table shows only the SOC classes where PT occurred in ≥5% of patients overall in either study and shows only the

The  most  common  AEs  were  eye-related  and  were  more  frequent  in  study  NGF0214  both  for  patients  on 
vehicle and rhNGF (study NGF0212: 30.8% versus 25% of patients on vehicle and rhNGF, respectively; study 
rhNGF0214:  58.3%  versus  78.3%  of  patients on  vehicle+methionine  and  rhNGF+methionine,  respectively). 
They included  mainly eye  pain (the  most common),  reduced visual  acuity, increased lacrimation and ocular 
hyperaemia.  Corneal  epithelium  defect,  cataracts,  ocular  discomfort,  foreign  body  sensation,  photophobia

and hyperaemia were also recorded by more than 8% of patients (although notably, this corresponds to only 
2  patients  in  study  NGF0214).  Disease  progression  was  reported  mainly  in  the  groups  receiving  vehicle. 
Headache was also commonly reported.  
Systemic  AEs  were  very  rare  in  the  clinical  trial,  and  those  which  did  occur  in  patients  being  treated  with 
rhNGF (neutropenia, arrhythmia, blood pressure increased, joint swelling, and paresthesia) were considered 
unlikely to be related to the study medication, given the very limited systemic absorption of rhNGF.  
In  the  Phase  II  segment  period  of  study  NGF0212  during  the  controlled  treatment  phase,  19  patients 
(18.3%)  reported  treatment-related  AEs.  Eye  pain  was  the  most  frequently  reported  treatment-related  AE, 
occurring in 6 patients (5.8%) overall: 4 patients (7.7%) in the rhNGF 20 μg/ml group and 2 patients (3.8%) 
in  the  vehicle  control  group.  Other  frequently  reported  treatment-related  AEs  included  blepharitis,  corneal 
neovascularization, eye pruritus and headache each reported by 2 patients (1.9%), one patient in each of the 
treatment  groups.  In  addition,  the  events  instillation  site  pruritus  and  erythema  of  eyelid  (considered 
symptoms  of  blepharitis)  were  reported  in  one  patient  (0.8%)  each.  Disease  progression  was  reported  by 
2 patients (3.8%) in the in the vehicle control group. In the uncontrolled treatment phase, overall, 2 patients 
(15.4%)  reported  6  treatment-related  AEs.  Of  the  13  patients  receiving  rhNGF  20  μg/ml,  two  patients 
experienced  a  treatment  related  event  of  blepharitis,  conjunctival  hyperaemia,  erythema  of  the  eyelid,  eye 
discharge, eye irritation and eye pain (7.7% each). 
Eighteen patients (18/47 = 38.3%) reported treatment-related AEs in study NGF0214: 10 (10/23 = 43.5%) 
patients  receiving  rhNGF  and  8  (8/24  =  33.3%)  patients  receiving  vehicle.  Again,  eye  pain  was  the  most 
frequently reported treatment-related AE, occurring in  4 patients  (8.5%) overall: 3 patients (13.0%) in the 
rhNGF 20 μg/ml group and 1 patient (4.2%) in the vehicle control group. Eye inflammation and the related 
terms anterior chamber inflammation and hyphaemia, as well as lacrimation increased and the related term 
eye discharge were each reported once in the rhNGF group (4.3%). Other treatment-related AEs reported for 
rhNGF included eyelid pain, foreign body sensation (2 patients each), ocular hyperaemia and photophobia (1 
patient each). Disease progression was reported by one patient in each treatment group. 
Secondary Safety Pool  
The Secondary Safety Pool encompassed 315 subjects who were treated with any dose of rhNGF. The pool 
included non-NK subjects treated for longer period of time (up to 24 months) and at higher doses than that 
proposed for the treatment of NK.  
Most of the AEs observed were ocular events; subjects with ocular events accounted for nearly three quarters 
(73.9%) of subjects reporting AEs and ocular events accounted for two thirds of AEs (66.2%) reported in the 
rhNGF groups. The types of ocular AEs was similar in this pool compared to the Primary Safety Pool, although 
percentages of AEs were generally lower compared to the Primary Safety Pool. In general, more AEs were 
reported in subjects treated with rhNGF compared to vehicle with slightly higher percentages in patients 
receiving the recommended dose or higher compared to lower dosages.  
Study NGF0212 comparison of rhNGF 20 µg/ml versus 10 µg/ml 
Data  for  study  NGF0212,  in  which  two  different  concentrations  of  rhNGF  were  tested,  showed  a  trend  of  a 
higher frequency of AEs with the higher dose. During the controlled treatment period of Phase II of the study, 
70 of the 156 patients (44.9%) experienced at least 1 AE: 23 patients (44.2%) in the rhNGF 10 µg/ml group, 
27 patients (51.9%) in the rhNGF 20 µg/ml group, and 20 patients (38.5%) in the vehicle control group. In 
total, 16% patients in this Phase had a treatment-related AE, with only 10.9% experiencing a serious AE and 
9.6% discontinuing due to an AE.

Eye pain was the most frequently reported AE, occurring in a total of 11 patients (7.1%): 2 patients in the 
rhNGF 10 µg/ml group, 5 patients in the rhNGF 20 µg/ml group, and 4 patients in the vehicle control group. 
Other  frequently  reported  AEs  included  disease  progression  occurring  in  a  total  of  10  patients  (6.4%); 
2 patients  each  in  the  10  µg/ml  and  20  µg/ml  groups  and  6  patients  in  the  vehicle  control  group;  reduced 
visual  acuity  occurring  in  a  total  of  7  patients  (4.5%);  2  patients  in  the  10  µg/ml  group,  3  patients  in  the 
rhNGF  20  µg/ml  group  and  2  patients  in  the  vehicle  control  group  and  headache,  occurring  in  a  total  of 
6 patients (3.8%); 2 patients in each treatment group. 
Long-term safety (Follow-up) 
  Study NGF0212 
Overall, 54 patients (34.6%) experienced at least 1 AE during the follow-up period: 22 patients (35.5%) in 
the 10 μg/ml group, 21 patients (32.3%) in the rhNGF 20 μg/ml group and 11 patients (37.9%) in the 
vehicle control group. Overall, a total of 163 AEs were reported during the follow-up period: 77 AEs were 
reported in 22 patients in the 10 μg/ml group, 65 AEs were reported in 21 patients in the rhNGF 20 μg/ml 
group, and 21 AEs were reported in 11 patients in the vehicle control group. Overall, 2 patients (1.3%), 1 
patient each in the 10 μg/ml group and the vehicle control group reported at least 1 AE during the follow-up 
period that was considered by the Investigator to be related to study treatment. 
Amongst the 13 patients who received an additional cycle of treatment with rhNGF during the follow-up 
period, 7 subjects experienced ocular TEAEs during the treatment cycle or in close temporal relationship with 
the treatment. In particular, 4 patients had a total of 10 ocular TEAEs with an onset date falling during re-
treatment: 1 patient with ophthalmic herpes, conjunctival hemorrhage, and conjunctivitis, 1 patient with 
corneal erosion, keratitis, keratitis herpetic, and belpharitis, 1 patient with increased IOP (recovered the 
same day without treatment), 1 patient with dry eye and eyelid pain.  
  Study NGF0214 
A total of 23 (48.9%) patients reported 68 AE in the follow-up period: 14 (60.9%) patients randomized to 
rhNGF reported 47 AE and 9 (9/24=37.5%) patients randomized to vehicle reported 21 AE. The majority of 
the AEs were of mild severity: 9 (19.1%) subjects reported 38 AEs of mild severity, 9 (19.1%) subjects 
reported 25 AEs of moderate severity, and 5 (10.6%) subjects reported 5 AEs of severe severity.  
The most frequently reported AEs were eye disorders, with 15 (31.9%) patients reporting 41 AE from this 
MedDRA SOC, 9 (39.1) patients randomized to treatment with rhNGF reporting 9 AE, and 6 (25.0%) patients 
randomized to treatment with vehicle reporting 12 AE. 
Five patients underwent a second course of treatment. Of these, 4 patients experienced 16 AEs. However, all 
4 patients had a complicated ocular history (several ocular comorbidities including corneal dystrophies, 
surgery and glaucoma) that predisposed them to ocular AEs. In spite of this, the AEs reported during 
retreatment were very limited. Specifically, the most common AE was eye pain (in 3 patients). The only other 
events were a recurrence of herpes infection, a case of disease progression, a case of cataract (in a patient 
who already had a history of cataract), and isolated cases of AEs related to eye irritation (ocular discomfort 
and hyperaemia). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
A  total  of  9  deaths  occurred  during  the  clinical  development  of  rhNGF  in  NK  patients  although  none  was 
considered related to treatment.  
Assessment report  
EMA/351805/2017 
Page 88/104 
 
  
  
Serious adverse events (SAE) were mainly eye-related. The majority were reported as mild or moderate and 
transient in nature. Fourteen patients (13.5%) experienced a SAE in the Phase II segment of study NGF0212 
during the controlled treatment period: 9 patients (17.3%) in the rhNGF 20 µg/ml group, and 5 patients 
(9.6%) in the vehicle control group. In study NGF0214, 8 SAEs were reported in 7 patients (14.9%): 3 
patients (13.0%) in the rhNGF 20 µg/ml group, and 4 patients (16.7%) in the vehicle control group. No clear 
difference between patients receiving the methionine-containing formulation (plus vehicle or rhNGF) and 
those receiving the methionine-free formulation.  
Disease  progression  was  reported  as  a  SAE  and  was  observed  in  3.8%  of  patients  in  study  NGF0212  and 
6.4%  in  study  NGF0214.  In  NGF0214,  the  percentage  of  patients  reporting  disease  progression  was  higher 
for those receiving vehicle (8.3% versus 4.3%). Furthermore, 2 patients in study NGF0212 (one each in the 
rhNGF 20 µg/ml and the vehicle group) experienced the SAE reduced visual acuity. All other SAEs occurred in 
1 patient each. 
During the follow-up period of the Phase II segment of study NGF0212, 22 patients (14.1%) overall 
experienced an SAE: 10 patients (16.1%) in the rhNGF 10 μg/ml group, 8 patients (12.3%) in the rhNGF 
20 μg/ml group, and 4 patients (13.8%) in the vehicle control group. None of the SAEs reported during the 
follow-up period were considered related to study treatment. Corneal opacity and respiratory failure occurred 
in 2 patients each (1.3%). All other SAEs occurred in 1 patient each.  In study NGF0214l, 7 patients 
(7/47=14.9%) reported 8 SAE during the follow-up period. 
Laboratory findings 
Laboratory  findings  and  vital  signs  were  only  evaluated  in  the  Primary  Safety  Pool.  No  notable  trends  or 
clinically  significant  changes  over  time  or  between  treatment  groups  were  observed  in  haematology  and 
serum  chemistry  parameters  during  rhNGF  treatment.  No  clinically  significant  changes  from  Baseline  or 
notable  differences  between  treatment  groups  were  observed  for  any  vital  signs  measurements  for  any 
patients in the Safety Pool. 
No anti-drug antibodies were detected at any time point for all patients in any of the Safety Pools. 
Ocular tolerability, intraocular pressure and dilated fundus ophthalmoscopy were considered to be AEs of 
special interest. In general no relevant changes were seen during the clinical trials. 
Safety in special populations 
Safety has not been specifically studied in special populations e.g. patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency.  
No data on the use of the medicinal product in children were available. 
A total of 104 elderly patients (≥65 years of age) were included in the NK clinical trial program.  Out of 
these, 77 were exposed to at least one cycle of active treatment (48 to rhNGF 20 µg/ml and 29 to 
rhNGF 10 µg/ml). Overall, the proportions of elderly patients experiencing adverse drug reactions as well as 
SAEs were similar to what was reported in the general NK patient population. No serious related adverse 
reaction was reported. Fatal cases reported during the study were not considered related to study treatment. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No interaction studies with other medicinal products have been performed.

In study NGF0212 a total of 81 patients used concomitant ocular medications in the controlled treatment 
period and 69 of them reported at least one adverse event (most being mild-to-moderate and transient): 
21/26 (81%) patients in the rhNGF 10 µg/ml, 27/30 (90%) patients in the rhNGF 20 µg/ml group, and 21/25 
(84%) patients in the vehicle group. In the rhNGF 10 µg/ml group a total of 69 AEs was reported, as 
compared to 120 in the rhNGF 20 µg/ml group and 102 in the vehicle group. Amongst the ocular AEs, 8/48 
(17%) in the rhNGF 10 µg/ml group, 15/71 (21%) in the rhNGF 20 µg/ml group, and 28/77 (36%) in the 
vehicle group were considered possibly related to study drug.

In the Primary Safety Pool, overall 13/104 (12.5%) patients in study NGF0212 and 12/47 (25.5%) patients in 
study NGF0214 discontinued study drug due to an AE occurring during the controlled treatment period. “Eye 
disorders” were the primary cause of treatment discontinuation in studies NGF0212 and NGF0214 (8.7% and 
14.9%, respectively), followed by “disease progression” (4.8% and 10.6%) that was more frequent in those 
patients treated with vehicle compared to rhNGF 20 µg/ml (5.8% versus 3.8% and 12.5% versus 8.7%, 
respectively). 
In the Secondary Safety Pool, a total of 12 AEs led to discontinuation of the study in 8 patients allocated to 
any dose of rhNGF. Ten AEs in 6 patients led to discontinuation during treatment with the recommended 
dosage of rhNGF. A total of 4 AEs in 4 patients in vehicle groups led to discontinuation. The rates of patients 
discontinuing study drug because of AEs was slightly lower with rhNGF than with vehicle (2.5-3.6% vs 3.8%). 
During the follow-up period of study NGF0212, 4 patients (2.6%) reported at least 1 AE that led to 
discontinuation of study treatment during the follow-up period: 1 patient in the rhNGF 10 μg/ml group, 
2 patients in the rhNGF 20 μg/ml group, and 1 patient in the vehicle control group. During the follow-up of 
study NGF0214, 1 (2.1%) patients randomized to vehicle reported 1 AE that led to study discontinuation.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The main basis for the safety assessment was derived from the Primary Safety Pool, including data from both 
pivotal  trials  NGF0212  (European  subjects,  L-methionine-free  formulation)  and  NGF0214  (US  subjects,  L-
methionine-containing  formulation)  in  NK  patients. This  included  a  comparison  of  the  safety  of  methionine-
free and –containing eye drops, the latter of which was proposed for commercial use. While methionine is a 
very common food ingredient with no reported toxicity issues related to its use, it has scarcely been used so 
far in ophthalmological preparations.  
The  Secondary  Safety  Pool,  including  data  from  all  5  studies  with  rhNGF  including  the  2  studies  in  NK 
patients,  one  trial  in  healthy  volunteers,  one  in  moderate-severe  dry  eye  disease  and  one  in  retinitis 
pigmentosa, was considered supportive.  Furthermore, both  a comparison of safety data for methionine-free 
and  methionine-containing  eye  drops  formulations  (i.e.  study  NGF0212  versus  NGF0214)  as  part  of  the 
Primary Safety Pool and for rhNGF doses (10 µg/ml versus 20 µg/ml) from study NGF0212 were performed.  
In general, the applicant’s approach for the safety assessment was considered acceptable by the CHMP.  
The total number of subjects exposed to any concentration of rhNGF was 315, including 177 NK patients. Of 
these,  only  82  NK  patients  (59  in  study  NGF0212  and  23  in  study  NGF0214)  were  treated  with 
rhNGF 20 µg/ml,  6  drops  per  day  in  the  affected  eye,  as  proposed  for  commercial  use.  Furthermore,  only 
23 patients  from  study  NGF0214  were  treated  with  the  proposed  formulation  containing  methionine  as  an 
excipient.  Additional  data  were  available  from  patients  initially  assigned  to  vehicle  who  did  not  heal  during 
the  8  weeks  controlled  treatment  period  and  therefore  received  rhNGF  during  Week  8-16  (23  and 
13 additional patients from study NGF0212 and NGF0214). Treatment duration was also limited with 8 weeks 
for  NK  patients.  For  subjects  included  in  other  clinical  trials  in  other  indications  treatment  duration  ranged 
from 4 to 24 weeks.   
The small number of exposed patients, in particular those receiving the formulation intended for commercial 
use (rhNGF 20 µg/ml methionine-containing eye drops) and duration of exposure impeded an accurate safety 
assessment,  whereby  almost  all  AEs  will  be  frequent  or  very  frequent  despite  being  reported  in  very  few 
patients and, in addition, less frequent AEs may not be reliably detected. However, given the low prevalence 
of NK, the  drug exposure  was  considered acceptable  by  the CHMP  for the  purpose  of  the  short-term safety 
assessment  of  rhNGF.  With  regards  to  long-term  safety  however,  the  CHMP  was  of  the  view  that  the  data 
included  in  the  Safety  Pools  (database  lock  after  3  months  and  4  weeks  follow-up)  were  too  limited.  In 
response  to  this  concern,  the  applicant  provided  full  long  term  results  for  both  clinical  trials  for  the  entire 
follow-up periods (12 months for study NGF0212 and 6 months for study NGF0214, see discussion below). 
The  most  common  AEs  in  the  Safety  Pools  were  eye-related,  mainly  eye  pain,  reduced  visual  acuity, 
increased lacrimation and ocular hyperaemia. Corneal epithelium defect, cataracts, ocular discomfort, foreign 
body sensation, photophobia and hyperaemia were also recorded by more than 8% of patients. Although the 
applicant states that the reporting of ocular surface symptoms could be sign of corneal re-innervation during 
the  re-epithelialization  period,  many  of  the  observed  AEs  affect  sites  outside  the  cornea,  such  as  the 
conjunctiva.  In  addition,  in  the  efficacy  assessment,  corneal  sensitivity  did  not  significantly  improve  during 
the trials. Conjunctival hyperaemia and photophobia had already been reported in a previous study in which 
topical murine NGF had been evaluated. Therefore,  a causal relationship with the use of Oxervate could not 
be ruled out per se. 
There  were  9  deaths  during  the  clinical  development  in  NK  patients.  None  was  considered  related  to 
treatment. Furthermore, only few SAEs were reported (14 [13.5%] patients in study NGF0212 and 7 (14.9%) 
Assessment report  
EMA/351805/2017 
Page 91/104 
 
  
  
patients  in  study  NGF0214).  Most  of  SAE  were  eye-related,  and  mild  or  moderate  and  transient  in  nature. 
This was altogether reassuring although the limited number of patients exposed to rhNGF prevented any firm 
conclusions.  
Eye disorders was the first cause of treatment discontinuation in studies NGF0212 and NGF0214 (8.7% and 
14.9%, respectively) followed by disease progression (4.8% and 10.6%) the latter being more frequent in 
patients treated with vehicle versus rhNGF (5.8% versus 3.8% and 12.5% versus 8.7%, for studies NGF0212 
and NGF0214, respectively). 
Safety  data  from  study  NGF0212,  in  which  two  different  concentrations  of  rhNGF  were  tested,  suggested  a 
dose-AEs relationship (for 10 and 20 µg/ml). The applicant argued that most of the AEs observed were single 
episodes as well as transient and non-serious in nature. More frequently reported events were ocular surface 
symptoms  such  as  eye  pain  (or  discomfort  such  as  increased  lacrimation  and  photophobia)  and  were 
considered  by  the  applicant  a  result  of  the  healing  process.  While  the  latter  argument  was  considered 
speculative  in  the  absence  of  more  solid  evidence,  the  CHMP  overall  agreed  that  from  a  safety  perspective 
the choice of the 20 µg/ml dose could be accepted.  
When comparing study NGF0212 and NGF0214 within the Primary Safety Pool analysis, the data suggested a 
worse safety profile for patients receiving methionine-containing eye drops (study NGF0214) compared to the 
methionine-free formulation (study NGF0212). Differences in the incidence of AEs (percentage of patients 
with at least 1 AE) were observed both for vehicle plus methionine versus vehicle (75% versus 38.5%) and 
for rhNGF plus methionine versus rhNGF (91.3% versus 51.9%). Furthermore, the percentage of patients 
discontinuing was also higher in study NGF0214 compared to study NGF0212. The applicant presented 
several arguments including that US patients and physicians involved in study NGF0214 tend to report AEs 
more frequently than Europeans, that no significant differences between SAEs were observed in patients 
receiving methionine-containing eye drops and those receiving methionine-free formulation and none of the 
SAEs was considered related to study drug. Reference was also made to the experience gained with an 
ophthalmic product registered since 1956 in Spain for the treatment of infections after extraction of foreign 
bodies or corneal erosions, which contains methionine at a much higher concentration (5mg/g) than in 
Oxervate. While uncertainties remained in relation to the tolerability of methionine as an excipient, the CHMP 
was of the view that the safety profile of the methionine-containing formulation was overall acceptable. 
However, the safety information in SmPC section 4.8 should reflect the higher AE frequencies observed in 
study NGF0214. 
For the purpose of labelling in the SmPC, the applicant applied the following criteria: 
- 
incidence had to be higher (even by only one event) in the patients treated with rhNGF than with placebo; 
- 
the events were not to be closely related to the underlying disease; 
- 
isolated ADRs were not considered if they were justified by the presence of concomitant diseases already 
listed in the medical history of the patient at baseline; 
- 
isolated systemic events since rhNGF is not absorbed into the bloodstream were excluded. 
For  the  frequency  calculation,  all  NK  patients  exposed  to  rhNGF  20  µg/ml  (including  the  controlled  and 
uncontrolled treatment periods as well as unscheduled treatment). As a result, the most commonly reported 
adverse  reactions  listed  in  the  SmPC  were  eye  pain  (11.1 %),  eye  inflammation  (8.3 %),  lacrimation 
increased (5.6 %), eyelid pain (5.6 %) and foreign body sensation in the eye (5.6 %). 
Assessment report  
EMA/351805/2017 
Page 92/104 
 
  
  
Safety  data  for  the  complete  follow-up  period  of  studies  NGF0212  and  NGF0214  included  18  patients  who 
received  a  second  treatment  with  rhNGF  due  to  recurrence  of  PED  or  ulcer  during  the  follow-up.  Overall, 
these long-term data showed no new or unexpected AEs compared to the short term safety profile, including 
for  the  methionine-containing  formulation.  Nevertheless,  long-term  safety  data  remained  limited.  In  this 
context, the CHMP appreciated the applicant’s plans for an additional  clinical study NGF0215 which will help 
enrich the safety database with long-term data for the commercial formulation. 
Finally,  given  that  Oxervate  is  not  systemically  absorbed,  no  impact  on  laboratory  measurements  or  vital 
signs was expected, and none was observed during the clinical trials. Anti-drug antibodies were not detected 
in any studies.  
For  the  same  reason,  no  interaction  studies  with  systemic  medicinal  products  were  required.  However, 
patients are expected to receive concomitant topical ocular medications in real life. In fact, a relevant subset 
of  the  study  population  received  concomitant  ocular  treatment  during  the  studies.  While  common  clinical 
practice  includes  discontinuation  of  pre-existing  topical  medications  for  NK  patients  to  reduce  the  risk  of 
drug-induced  corneal  toxicity,  at  the  same  time,  depending  on  the  local  practice,  concomitant  medication 
may be applied to prevent corneal infections in the presence of corneal ulceration. With respect to the risk of 
intraocular PK or PD interactions, due to the mechanism of action and the characteristics of the metabolism 
of rhNGF, the risk for interactions could be  expected to be low (see also sections  2.3. and 2.4. ). Therefore 
and since  a comparative analysis of AEs  in patients with  and  without  concomitant medication in the clinical 
trials had not revealed relevant differences, the CHMP considered the lack of interaction studies acceptable. 
Absence  of  studies  in  special  populations  including  patients  with  renal  or  hepatic  insufficiency  as  well  as  in 
pregnant  and  lactating  women  was  considered  acceptable  since  the  product  is  not  systemically  absorbed. 
Oxervate  is  only  intended  for  use  in  adult  NK  patients.  A  Paediatric  Investigational  Plan  (PIP)  deferral  was 
granted  for  all  paediatric  age  groups.  The  PIP  considered  that  safety  in  children  could  be  inferred  by 
considering data in adults together with the results of juvenile animal toxicology studies in the rat and rabbit. 
With  regards  to the  elderly,  just  slightly  less  than  half  of  the  patients  who participated  in  studies  NGF0212 
and NGF0214 were over 65 years of age. The available data supported a similar safety profile compared to 
the overall population. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Despite  the  limited  size  of  the  safety  database  both  in  terms  of  the  number  of  exposed  patients  and  the 
duration of the exposure, and inherent difficulties in interpretation  of the  safety data, the CHMP considered 
the available data to be sufficient to support the present application of Oxervate for use in the treatment of 
moderate to severe NK in adult patients with regards to clinical safety. Adverse events were mostly mild to 
moderate  ocular  events  including  eye  pain,  increased  lacrimation  and  ocular  hyperaemia.  Based  on  the 
available short-term and long-term data, the safety profiles of both the methionine-free and the methionine-
containing  formulations  were  considered  acceptable,  although  some  uncertainties  on  the  tolerability  of  this 
excipient  remained.  The  CHMP  recommended  that  the  applicant  pursued  the  plans  for  an  additional  study 
(NGF0215)  to  generate  further  long-term  data  with  the  commercial,  methionine-containing  formulation,  to 
help  address  the  remaining  uncertainties  with  the  use  of  Oxervate  including  tolerability  of  the  excipient 
methionine.

the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did not request alignment of the PSUR cycle with 
the  international  birth  date  (IBD).  The  new  EURD  list  entry  will  therefore  use  the  EBD  to  determine  the 
forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that cenegermin has not been previously authorised in a medicinal product in the 
European Union. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers cenegermin to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, OXERVATE (cenegermin) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained 
in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the SmPC and the PL include a statement that this medicinal product is subject to additional 
monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety information. The statement is preceded 
by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
NK is a rare degenerative corneal disease that originates from an impairment of corneal trigeminal 
innervation and reduction in or loss of corneal sensitivity. Trophic changes within the cornea occur and can 
lead to recurrent or PED with poor tendency of spontaneous healing. NK can result in severe visual 
impairment and the progression of the disease may lead to corneal ulcers, melting, and perforation.  
Therapy of NK aims at preventing progression of corneal damage and to promote epithelial healing. 
Oxervate (rhNGF or cenegermin) is intended for treatment of moderate (persistent epithelial defect) or 
severe (corneal ulcer) NK in adults.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
NK is a rare disease with numerous and heterogeneous underlying causes. Based on the prevalence of a 
range of predisposing or accompanying conditions, NK prevalence can be estimated at less than 4.1 per 
10,000 patients. Moderate and severe disease (stage 2 and 3 according to the Mackie classification) are 
estimated to constitute approximately one third of the total NK population. 
The use of preservative-free artificial tears may help to improve the corneal surface integrity at all disease 
stages. Use of topical antibiotic eye drops to prevent infection is recommended at NK stages 2 and 3. 
Experimental use of blood-derived eye drops (autologous serum, cord blood serum, and platelet rich plasma) 
has also been reported in some cases. Non-pharmacological treatments for more severe NK include 
therapeutic corneal or scleral contact lenses. Furthermore botulinum A toxin injection of the eyelid elevator 
muscle, and surgical treatments such as tarsorrhaphy, conjunctival flap or amniotic membrane 
transplantation as well as palpebral springs are used to cover the ulcer and preserve the anatomical integrity 
of the eye in more advanced cases. However, these measures adversely affect visual function and have a 
poor cosmetic outcome. 
At the time of this report, no pharmaceutical treatments had been authorised for NK patients who are 
refractory to conventional non-surgical NK therapies and hence progressed to stage 2 and 3. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Efficacy of rhNFG (cenegermin) in the treatment of NK was investigated in two pivotal double-masked, 
randomized, multi-centre, vehicle-controlled, parallel group Phase II studies: NGF0212 and NGF0214.  
While study NGF0212 was conducted in the EU and investigated 2 different strength of rhNGF (10 and 
20µg/ml) methionine-free eye-drop formulation, study NGF0214 was performed at sites in the US using 
20µg/ml rhNGF methionine-containing eye-drops intended for commercial purposes. Both studies recruited 
adult patients with moderate and severe clinical stage of NK, i.e. those with persistent epithelial defects 
(stage 2) or with corneal ulcer (stage 3) and documented decreased corneal sensitivity.  
Assessment report  
EMA/351805/2017 
Page 98/104 
 
  
  
In study NGF0212, a total of 156 patients were randomized compared to 48 patients in study NGF0214. 
Patients initially entered an 8-week double-blind controlled period and thereafter a follow-up period of 48/56 
weeks (NGF0212) and 24/32 weeks (NGF0214), respectively. During the 8-week double-blind period, 
patients received a single drop of rhNGF eye drops or vehicle in the affected eye 6 times a day and were 
monitored for healing or deterioration of the corneal defect, as well as functional outcomes including 
improvement in visual acuity and corneal sensitivity. Patients in the vehicle arm who were not healed after 
the initial 8-week double-blind phase could receive a course of rhNGF treatment. In case of recurrence in 
initially healed patients, a second course of treatment with rhNGF could be administered.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
After both 4 and 8 weeks, more patients treated with rhNGF compared to those treated with the vehicle 
achieved complete corneal healing determined by the central reading centre in the two pivotal trials. In study 
NGF0212, the cure rates at 8 weeks were 74.5% (38/51), 74% (37/50) and 43.1% (22/51) in the 10 μg/ml 
rhNGF, 20 μg/ml rhNGF, and the vehicle group, respectively. Both rhNGF doses were statistically superior to 
vehicle (difference of 31.4% [p<0.001] and 30.9% [p<0.002], respectively), but no differences was obvious 
between doses. In study NGF0214, 69.6% (16/23) of patients on rhNGF 20 μg/ml reached complete healing, 
compared to the 29.2% (7/24) of patients receiving vehicle (difference of 40.4% p=0.006).  
Although healing rates were generally lower after 4 weeks of treatment, statistically significant results in 
favour of rhNGF were already achieved at this earlier time point in study NGF0212. Patients on rhNGF 
20 μg/ml reached the highest cure rate (58%; 29/50) versus 54.9% of patients receiving 10 μg/ml (28/51). 
This compares to 19.6% (10/51) of complete healing with vehicle (difference of 38.4% [p<0.001] and 35.3% 
[p<0.001], respectively). Again, no difference between doses was observed. Study NGF0214 failed to show 
superiority of rhNGF over vehicle at 4 weeks (secondary endpoint), but a clear numerical advantage was 
observed (56.5% patients on rhNGF 20 μg/ml versus 35.5% on vehicle, difference 19.0%; p=0.191).  
Analyses of the response rates measured by the clinical investigator were in line with the results determined 
by the reading centre. Robustness of the results was shown in the sensitivity analyses including different 
ways to handle missing data. Likewise, analyses of complete corneal clearing (i.e. zero staining) as an 
alternative definition for complete healing yielded results consistent with the primary efficacy analysis. Time 
to complete healing, although only an exploratory analysis in study NGF0212, also supported a treatment 
effect of rhNGF, with patients in the active groups being healed earlier than in the vehicle group, with a 
median time of 29 days (95% CI: 20; 55), 28 days (95% CI: 19; 55), and 56 days (95% CI: 42; not 
estimable), in the rhNGF 10 μg/ml group, 20 μg/ml group, and vehicle control group, respectively. 
A trend towards improvement in visual acuity over time was shown in both studies irrespective of treatment 
(active and vehicle). In study NGF0212 at 8 weeks, the mean improvement in BCDVA was 15.8 letters 
(rhNGF 10 μg/ml) and 11.9 letters (rhNGF 20 μg/ml) versus 6.9 letters in the vehicle group. The differences 
with respect to vehicle were 8.9 letters and 5.0 letters, respectively. Only the difference between rhNGF 
10 μg/ml and vehicle was statistically significant (p=0.022). In study NGF0214, no difference between 
treatment arms was observed; mean changes from baseline were 4.48 letters (LS mean change: 5.0 letters) 
and 4.33 letters (LS mean change: 3.9 letters) in patients receiving rhNGF and vehicle, respectively.   
Deterioration defined as an increase in lesion size ≥ 1mm, decrease in BCDVA by >5 letters, progression in 
lesion depth to corneal melting or perforation or onset of infection, occurred only in few patient and 
numerically more often in patients on vehicle than on rhNGF.  
Assessment report  
EMA/351805/2017 
Page 99/104 
 
  
  
Results from the follow-up period of study NGF0212 were reassuring, showing that for more than 80% of 
patients healed at Week 8/16 after treatment with rhNGF (regardless of the dose), the corneal defects 
remained healed during the 48-week follow-up. A positive impact of active treatment on visual acuity and at 
least a non detrimental effect on corneal sensitivity was also observed. 
Finally, both rhNGF doses tested in study NGF0212 appeared to have similar efficacy profiles and a clinical 
benefit was evident for either dose. The choice of the higher dose to be marketed was justified by the 
applicant based on a trend towards a clinically significant improvement in efficacy for the higher dose 
observed in some endpoints, including an early improvement in corneal healing, an increase in the number of 
patients with zero residual corneal staining as well as a later recurrence after corneal healing. However, the 
opposite was true for other endpoints and no clear efficacy advantage of rhNGF 20 μg/ml over 10 μg/ml was 
obvious from the available data.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
In addition to restoring ocular surface integrity, a favourable effect in functional outcomes would be a 
relevant treatment objective in NK. While visual acuity improved over time in all treatment groups in both 
studies, the difference between rhNGF and vehicle was not statistically significant for the vast majority of 
analyses conducted. Similarly, there was a trend towards improvement in corneal sensitivity during the 
course of both studies regardless of whether patients received rhNGF or vehicle with no clinically relevant or 
statistically significant differences between the groups. A possible explanation might be that residual corneal 
damage not completely healed at the time of assessment delayed or restricted improvements of functional 
outcomes. However, this theory was not supported by actual data. Whether further functional improvements 
could be achieved with longer or repeated courses of rhNGF treatment was unclear at the time of this report.  
The main support for efficacy of Oxervate was derived from data after a single course of 8 weeks treatment 
with rhNGF. Only very limited data for repeated treatment courses in case of recurrences was available 
(18 patients) and only safety data were reported for these patients. Also, while the available data suggested 
that patients continued to improve over time while on treatment (e.g. in study NGF0212, the corneal defect 
had healed in 30 additional patients by Week 8 compared to Week 4), an extended treatment period beyond 
8 weeks was not investigated. Thus, whether at least some patients could obtain further benefit when 
continuing treatment beyond 8 weeks is currently not known, but additional data are expected form the 
clinical trial NGF0215, which the applicant plans to conduct post-approval.  
A higher than expected number of patients withdrew from both studies (approximately 30% by week 8). 
Uncertainties as to the impact of the low retention rate on the study outcome were however considered to 
have been adequately addressed by additional analyses conducted by the applicant including analyses based 
on observed cases, as well as imputing missing data as failures or using multiple imputation method, all of 
which showed results consistent with the primary analysis (LOCF).  
Furthermore, the proportion of subjects who experienced corneal healing in the control arms (43 and 29 % in 
NGF0212 and NGF0214, respectively) was rather large considering that subjects recruited in the studies were 
patients with a long duration of NK with persistent epithelial defects and ulcers. However, the high vehicle 
healing rate was in fact expected and can be explained by the provision of high standard of care and the 
close monitoring of patients during the studies. 
Finally, both studies included patients with different disease severity (stage 2 and 3) and a wide spectrum of 
aetiologies as cause of NK. While these factors could be expected to have an impact on the treatment 
Assessment report  
EMA/351805/2017 
Page 100/104 
 
  
  
response to rhNGF, subgroup analyses for stage 2 and 3 disease and by main NK aetiologies showed no 
relevant differences in cure rates. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The most common adverse reactions observed with Oxervate during the clinical trials program were eye-
related and included eye pain (11.1 %), eye inflammation (8.3 %), lacrimation increased (5.6 %), eyelid pain 
(5.6 %) and foreign body sensation in the eye (5.6 %). In addition to being local, most events were reported 
only once and were transient and non-serious in nature. Few SAEs were reported and most of these were 
eye-related, mild or moderate and transient.  
Long term safety data (12 and 6 months follow-up period of study NGF2012 and NGF0214, respectively) 
including 18 patients receiving a 2nd course of treatment with rhNGF due to recurrence of PED or corneal 
ulcer, did not reveal any new or unexpected AEs. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
During the clinical development of Oxervate, the rhNGF formulation was changed and L-methionine was 
added as an antioxidant to increase the stability of the product. Experience with this excipient is limited in 
ophthalmological products. Only patients in study NGF0214 received the L-methionine formulation to be 
marketed and thus exposure was rather limited (see below). When comparing data from study NGF0212 
(methionine-free formulation) and study NGF0214, it emerged that AEs were more frequent in study 
NGF0214. This applied to patient receiving vehicle in either study including patients with at least 1 AE (75% 
versus 38.5%), patients with at least 1 serious AE (16.7% versus 9.6%), patients with at least 1 AE leading 
to discontinuation (29.2% versus 7.7%) and patients with at least 1 AE in relation to the study drug (33.3% 
versus 19.2%). Similarly, for patients on rhNGF plus methionine higher percentages of patients with at least 
1 AE (91.3% versus 51.9%) and with at least 1 AE in relation to the study drug (43.5% versus 17.3%) were 
observed compared to those receiving a methionine-free rhNGF formulation. However, overall the CHMP 
considered the safety profile of the methionine-containing formulation acceptable and agreed to its use 
provided the safety information in SmPC section 4.8 reflects the higher AE frequencies observed in NGF0214. 
The total number of subjects exposed to any concentration of rhNGF was 315. However, amongst these were 
only  75  stage 2 or 3  NK patients treated  with  the  concentration  proposed  for approval  (rhNGF 20 µg/ml, 6 
times a day in the affected eye). Furthermore, only 23 patients from study NGF0214 were treated with the 
proposed formulation for marketing containing L-methionine as an excipient. The duration of exposure was 8 
weeks  in  NK  patients,  whereby  18  subjects  received  a  2nd  course  of  rhNGF  treatment  during  the  follow-up 
period  of  studies  NGF0212  and  0214.  The  small  number  of  NK  patients,  in  particular  those  receiving  the 
formulation intended for commercial use (rhNGF 20 µg/ml methionine-containing eye drops) and the limited 
duration  of  exposure,  precluded  the  detection  of  rare  events  and  realistic  frequency  estimations.  However, 
given the low prevalence of NK, the drug exposure was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
Finally,  safety  data  for  the  dose-ranging  study  NGF0212  showed  an  apparent  dose-AEs  relationship: 
20 patients  (38.5%)  in  the  vehicle  control  group,  23  patients  (44.2%)  in  the  rhNGF  10  µg/ml  group,  and 
27 patients (51.9%) in the rhNGF 20 µg/ml group experienced at least 1 AE. However, given that no major 
safety issues with the use of Oxervate had been observed (most AEs were local, transient and reported only 
once), the safety profile of both dose strength were considered acceptable.

3.2.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.2.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The most relevant beneficial effect observed with Oxervate (rhNGF 20 µg/ml) has been a 30-40% increase in 
the rate of NK patients with complete healing of their corneal defect after a single course of rhNGF treatment 
Assessment report

for 8 weeks compared to vehicle. This finding represents a clear benefit for the target population with stage 2 
or 3 disease in whom the main treatment objective is to prevent disease progression to corneal perforation 
and potentially permanent loss of vision. This is of special interest for refractory forms of the disease in which 
the therapeutic approach includes surgical procedures with poor cosmetic outcome and negative impact on 
visual function. Efficacy of rhNGF with regards to corneal healing has been robustly demonstrated with a 
statistically significant difference compared to vehicle observed in 2 pivotal clinical trials including L-
methionine-free and –containing rhNGF formulations, respectively, and across multiple endpoints using 
different definitions for corneal improvements. The effect on healing of the cornea is also supported by a 
reduced risk of deterioration reported in the studies. In addition, results from the follow-up period of up to 
1 year were reassuring. The majority of patients who were healed after 8 weeks of treatment with rhNGF 
remained healed during the 48-week follow-up. Furthermore, a favourable trend on visual acuity and at least 
a non detrimental effect on corneal sensitivity were seen.   
Adverse reactions were mainly ocular and transient in nature. They included eye pain, increased lacrimation 
and conjunctival hyperaemia. Safety data obtained with the L-methionine containing rhNGF eye drops 
suggested a higher frequency of AEs compared to the methionine–free formulation, but no new safety issues 
were detected. Given that Oxervate is not systemically absorbed, no systemic AEs were expected and those 
reported did not seem related to the drug. Long-term data did not reveal additional safety issues. 
The main drawback with regards to the safety assessment was the small number of NK patients exposed to 
Oxervate in particular when considering the proposed commercial formulation of 20 μg/ml rhNGF including 
L-methionine as excipient. This made the interpretation of the safety data difficult as almost all AEs appear 
frequent or very frequent despite only been reported in very few patients. At the same time, rare events 
cannot be reliably detected either. However, given the low prevalence of NK, the limited drug exposure was 
considered acceptable by the CHMP.  
3.2.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Clinically relevant benefits with the use of Oxervate (rhNGF 20μg/ml) have been robustly demonstrated with 
an improvement of 30-40% in the healing rate of corneal defects in stage 2 and 3 NK patients. These 
benefits outweighed the risks of mainly transient ocular adverse reactions, including eye pain, increased 
lacrimation and conjunctival hyperaemia. Considering all favourable and unfavourable effects, the benefit-risk 
balance of Oxervate in the treatment of moderate (persistent epithelial defect) or severe (corneal ulcer) 
neurotrophic keratitis in adults is considered positive. 
3.2.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
3.3.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit-risk balance of Oxervate is positive.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
risk-benefit balance of Oxervate is favourable in the following indication: 
Treatment of moderate (persistent epithelial defect) or severe (corneal ulcer) neurotrophic keratitis in adults.  
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions:

long-term of immunogenicity information and safety 
results based on final results from study V920-009 
(Partnership for Research on Ebola Vaccines in

SmPC new text 
- Section 5.1 
Clinical immunogenicity in adults 18 years of age and older 
Over 93.8% of vaccine recipients from Protocols 009, 011, 
012, 016 and 018 met seroresponse criteria defined as a 
≥2 fold increase from baseline and ≥200 EU/mL at any 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

participants met seroresponse criteria defined as a ≥4 fold 
increase from baseline at any time post-vaccination by 
PRNT. Over 80.3% of participants continued to meet the 
seroresponse criteria for GP-ELISA and over 63.8% of 
vaccine recipients continued to meet seroresponse criteria 
for PRNT at 12 months. The clinical relevance of the 
immunogenicity data is currently not known.

based on final results from study V920-016 
(PREVAC); this is a phase 2, randomised, double-
blind, placebo-controlled study of 2 leading Ebola 
vaccine candidates (Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo and 
V920) and 3 vaccine strategies 
(Ad26.ZEBOV/MVABN-Filo, 1-dose V920, and 2 dose 
V920) to evaluate immunogenicity and safety in 
healthy children and adolescents from 1 to 17 years 
of age and adults 18 years of age and older. As a 
consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, and 
5.3 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is 
updated in accordance. Version 2.0 of the RMP has 
also been approved. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to update the Annex II and the list of 
local representatives in the Package Leaflet.

where significant assessment is required 
comprehensive data supports a favourable benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product Ervebo. 
Pursuant to Article 14-a(8) of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004, the CHMP recommends by consensus the 
granting of a marketing authorisation in accordance with 
Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 for Ervebo. 
Consequently, section 5.1 of the SmPC has been updated 
to delete the reference to “Conditional Approval” scheme 
and Annex II E has been updated to delete Specification 
Obligations to complete post-authorisation measures for 
the conditional marketing authorisation. The Package 
Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
Due to extensive commercial confidential information 
enclosed in the Assessment Report for quality variations,  
this is not available to public access.

Ervebo in vaccinated frontline workers 18 years of age and 
older that was implemented as Part B of the Phase 3 ring 
vaccination study for Protocol 010. In this trial, a total of

to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of Ervebo 
in vaccinated frontline workers 18 years of age and 
older that was implemented as Part B of the Phase 3 
ring vaccination study V920-010. With this 
submission, REC 20 is fulfilled. 
C.I.4: To update section 5.1 of the SmPC based on 
the result of the final study reports on the Correlate 
of Protection. With this submission, REC 16 is 
fulfilled. 
C.I.4: To update section 5.1 of the SmPC, based on 
results from the integrated summary of 
immunogenicity (ISI). With this submission, RECs 15 
and 22 are fulfilled. 
C.I.13: Submission of Non-Human Primates (NHP) 
Correlate of Protection analysis report (non-clinical 
report). Analysis is based upon previous submitted 
NHP studies which are already part of the dossier. 
The MAH takes the opportunity to implement 
changes in the Package Leaflet following the 
assessment of the User Acceptance Test, procedure 
EMEA/H/C/004554/REC/011. With the 
implementation of these changes to the PL, the MAH 
fulfils REC011. In addition, minor editorial changes 
have been included in the SmPC and patient leaflet. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
2,115 subjects were enrolled and 2,016 subjects were 
vaccinated with Ervebo. An immunogenicity sub-study 
included 1,217 subjects who were vaccinated and provided 
samples for the assessment of immunogenicity. 
Immunogenicity data were obtained in Protocol 009 in 
Liberia, Protocol 011 in Sierra Leone, Protocol 012 in the 
United States, Canada, and Europe, and Protocol 018 in 
Guinea. Gamma irradiation of specimens (from regions 
involved in Ebola outbreaks) was performed to reduce risk 
of wild-type Ebola virus infection of laboratory workers, but 
increased pre-vaccination GP-ELISA immune responses by 
approximately 20% and decreased post-vaccination GP-
ELISA and PRNT immune responses by approximately 20%. 
Gamma irradiation, baseline seropositivity and other factors 
result in a higher immune response in Protocol 012.

Annex II 
The CHMP, having reviewed the available information on 
the status of the fulfilment of Specific Obligations and 
having confirmed the positive benefit risk balance, is of the 
opinion that the quality, safety and efficacy of this 
medicinal product continue to be adequately and 
sufficiently demonstrated and therefore recommends the 
renewal of the conditional MA for Ervebo, subject to the 
Specific Obligations and Conditions as laid down in Annex II 
to the opinion. 
The CHMP considered that process validation data were 
provided demonstrating that the active substance process 
is properly validated. Comparability data confirmed that the 
commercial product manufactured at the Burgwedel site is 
representative of the material used in the clinical trials. 
Additional qualification data were provided for a critical 
reagent used in the identity test ensuring proper quality

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for artesunate, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on risk(s) of “immune haemolytic anaemia” and “Electrocardiogram QT 
prolonged” from the literature and spontaneous reports including in some cases a close temporal 
relationship and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers that a causal 
relationship between artesunate (IV) and “immune haemolytic anaemia” as well as for 
“Electrocardiogram QT prolonged” is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the 
product information of products containing artesunate (IV) should be amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for artesunate the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing artesunate is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Evolus Pharma Limited submitted on 22 June 2017 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Nuceiva, through the centralised procedure 
under Article 3 (2) (a) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was 
agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 15 September 2016.  
The applicant applied for the following indication:  
When the severity of the following facial lines has an important psychological impact in adult patients, 
Nuceiva is indicated for the temporary improvement in the appearance of moderate to severe vertical 
lines between the eyebrows seen at maximum frown (glabellar lines). 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application. The applicant indicated that 
botulinum toxin type A was considered to be a new active substance. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical 
and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0369/206 on the granting of a (product-specific) waiver.  
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication. 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance botulinum toxin type A contained in the above medicinal 
product to be considered as a new active substance in comparison to botulinum toxin type A previously 
authorised in the European Union as the applicant claimed that botulinum toxin type A differs significantly 
in properties with regard to safety and/or efficacy from the already authorised active substance. 
Scientific Advice 
The applicant received Scientific Advice on 25 February 2016(EMEA/H/SA/3228/1/2015/III) for the 
development programme supporting the indication granted by the CHMP. The Scientific Advice pertained 
to the following quality, non-clinical, and clinical aspects: 
EMA/281737/2019 
Page 9/131 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
•  Suitability of the approach to demonstrate cell bank identity between Evolus and Reference 
Medicinal Product (RMP)- this was in relation to the initial submission strategy, as presented at 
the time of the Scientific advice procedure; to demonstrate equivalence of amino acid sequence; 
to demonstrate equivalence of higher order structure; to demonstrate equivalency in the 100 
Unit vial and overall acceptability of the biosimilarity exercise and data package. 
•  Suitability of the approach of the stability data from the new manufacturing facility sufficient for 
initial MAA filing. 
•  Suitability of the nonclinical development to support MAA: specific head-to-head comparison 
studies of DWP-450 (Nuceiva) against the comparator. 
•  Acceptability of the clinical development program for the glabellar line and post stroke upper 
limb study: phase 3-comparator glabellar study in EU countries; phase 3-comparator glabellar 
study in South Korea; phase 3-comparator spasticity study in South Korea; two US phase II 
open label long term, repeat dose studies (EV-004, EV-006); two identical US phase III, placebo 
controlled single dose studies (EV-001, EV-002). 
•  Appropriateness of the dosing ranges sufficiently addressed. 
•  Whether it is acceptable to extrapolate the results of the Korean studies to all ethnic groups.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Glabellar lines at maximum frown are attributed to the (over-)activity of the underlying corrugator and 
procerus muscles.  Botulinum toxin, Type A, is a neurotoxin produced by Clostridium botulinum, and is 
known to play a role in relaxing muscles by blocking the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. 
Use of botulinum toxin in the treatment of upper facial lines that have an important psychological impact 
has been approved in the EU since 2002, and several botulinum toxin A products are currently approved 
for the following indication:  
When the severity of the following facial lines has an important psychological impact in adult patients, 
Botulinum toxin is indicated for the temporary improvement in the appearance of moderate to severe 
vertical lines between the eyebrows seen at maximum frown (glabellar lines). 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Treatment with Botulinum toxin injections has become one of the most common non-surgical procedures 
performed. According to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, in 2015, 6.7 million Botulinum toxin 
Type A procedures were performed in the United States of America (USA), making it the most common 
minimally invasive procedure. Risk factors include smoking, exposure to UV light, and ageing. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
The glabellar complex comprises the bilateral corrugator supercilii and procerus muscles but other 
important factors contribute to the genesis of facial lines lipoatrophy, gravitational folds, and skin ageing 
with loss of elasticity.   
Botulinum toxin, Type A, molecular weight 900 kDa, is a covalently bonded dimer of Neurotoxin (150 
kDa) with a heavy chain, H, comprising Lectin-like, Neurospecific polysiayloganglioside binding and 
Translocation domains plus a Zn binding Metalloproteinase light chain; non-toxic, non-haemagglutinin, 
NTNH, protein; and haemagglutinin proteins (HA50, HA33, HA20 and HA17).  
Botulinum toxin, Type A i.m. inhibits the release of acetylcholine, ACh, from presynaptic motor neurons at 
the neuromuscular junction, NMJ, to cause flaccid muscle paralysis. Botulinum H, binds selectively to 
receptors at the presynaptic surface of cholinergic neurons, inducing uptake into the nerve terminal by 
receptor mediated endocytosis. At low pH, the L chain is released into the cytosol, the inter-chain 
disulphide bond is cleaved, to form active metalloproteinase which cleaves synaptosomal associated 
protein, SNAP-25, an essential component of the protein complex promoting fusion of ACh vesicles with 
the presynaptic membrane. Enzymatic degradation of SNAP-25 blocks release of ACh from the nerve into 
the NMJ. Cleavage of 10–15% of SNAP-25 is sufficient to cause a complete blockade of neurotransmitter 
release and cleaved products may act as dominant negative inhibitors of the neuroexocytosis of ACh 
pending further degradation.   
A characteristic feature of the flaccid neuroparalysis induced by botulinum toxin A is its complete 
reversibility. The duration of paralysis depends on dose, mode of administration, and type of nerve 
terminal. The duration of action of botulinum toxin type A is 3 – 4 months for skeletal muscle and about 
1 year for autonomic cholinergic nerve terminals. Reversal occurs through the sprouting of new nerve 
terminals over weeks to several months followed by remodelling of the NMJ, resulting in gradual recovery 
EMA/281737/2019 
Page 12/131 
 
 
  
 
 
of muscle function. Clinical MRI studies show muscle volume loss 12 months after single and muscle 
volume loss with fat accumulation after multiple administrations of botulinum toxin type A. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
Diagnosis is based on an assessment of the severity of the glabellar lines by the patients and the 
physician. In the EU diagnosis of a medical need for treatment with botulinum toxin A requires 
establishment of an important psychological impact associated with the glabellar lines. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Treatment goals have evolved from muscle paralysis to modulation of muscle activity. Expert medical 
consensus (Global aesthetics consensus group, Sundaram 2016) regards as critical the following: 
•  A patient-tailored approach 
• 
Integrated assessment of the face e.g. co-treatment of glabellar and lateral canthal lines 
•  Age appropriate treatment such as lower doses of toxin* 
•  Combination treatment with hyaluronic acid fillers (used by 21% of the expert consensus panel 
for glabellar lines, only 75% used botulinum toxin alone)  
* For OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox, Botox Cosmetic) doses of 2 to 4 U per injection point and 12 – 40 U in 
total are regarded as typical, but “doses as low as 8U may be appropriate for some patients”, (Sundaram 
2016).

Botulinum toxin, Type A, is a neurotoxin produced by Clostridium botulinum, and is known to play a role 
in relaxing muscles by blocking the release of the neurotransmitter called acetylcholine. The toxin is a 
two-chain polypeptide, a heavy chain joined by a bond to a light chain. The light chain is a protease 
enzyme that attacks fusion proteins at a neuromuscular junction, preventing the vesicles containing 
acetylcholine from anchoring to the pre-synaptic membrane, hence inhibiting their release. The toxin 
therefore interferes with nerve impulses by inhibiting the release of acetylcholine into the neuromuscular 
junction, causing a flaccid paralysis of muscles. The active substance has the same structural 
characteristics, physicochemical and biological properties as Botulinum toxin, Type A. 
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The active substance is manufactured by Daewoong Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Republic of Korea. 
The active substance manufacturing process has been adequately described. The main steps are: 
•  Cell Culture and Fermentation 
o  Thawing of the WCB Vial 
o  Seed Cultures I and II 
o  Main Culture Fermentation 
•  Sulfuric Acid Precipitation and Harvest 
EMA/281737/2019 
Page 14/131 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
• 
Enzyme Treatment and Toxin Extraction 
•  Hydrochloric Acid Precipitation and Toxin Dissolution 
•  Downstream and Purification Process  
o  Purification Process (two steps) 
o  Filling and Storage 
Cells from a single thaw of an aliquot of the Working Cell Bank (WCB) are used for the seed expansion. 
After this cultivation, acid precipitation is used to concentrate and harvest the toxin complex from the 
main culture fluid. The toxin complex is then solubilized from the precipitated toxin complex in buffer and 
precipitated with an acid then clarified by centrifugation. After this harvest step, the toxin complex is 
purified and the nucleic acids are removed by chromatography.  
The toxin complex is then crystallized and the neurotoxin product is separated from impurities by 
chromatography and subsequently is sterile filtered prior to filling and storage.  
There is no pooling of sub-batches, reworking or reprocessing described in the dossier. 
A batch consists of purified Botulinum Toxin, Type A from a single fermentation run and the entire content 
of the bioreactor is purified.  
The ranges of critical process parameters and the routine in-process controls along with acceptance 
criteria are described for each step. The active substance manufacturing process is considered 
acceptable. The process has been sufficiently described and in-process controls are adequately set to 
control the process. 
The active substance is stored in ready-to-use, sterile, 1.8 ml polypropylene (PP) tubes with high density 
polyethylene (HDPE) screw cap. The materials of the active substance container closure system meet the 
requirements of the European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) 
The active substance is transferred from the active substance manufacturing facility to the finished 
product manufacturing facility for processing to finished product. The shipping conditions have been 
validated. 
Control of materials 
Sufficient information on raw materials used in the active substance manufacturing process has been 
submitted. Compendial raw materials are tested in accordance with the corresponding monograph, while 
specifications (including test methods) for non-compendial raw materials are presented. No human or 
animal derived materials are used in the active substance manufacturing process and acceptable 
documents have been provided for raw materials of biological origin used in the establishment of cell 
substrate.  
A two tiered cell banking system in accordance with the recommendations in International Conference of 
Harmonization (ICH) Q5D is used and sufficient information is provided regarding testing of Master Cell 
Bank (MCB) and WCB and release of future WCBs. Genetic stability has been demonstrated for cells at and 
beyond the limit of cell age. A protocol for establishment of future WCB has been provided. 
The MCB was manufactured at Daewoong Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. using the Clostridium botulinum 
bacterial strain. The MCB was tested for identity, purity, and contamination according to ICH Q5D. As 
Clostridium botulinum is an unsuitable host for infectious viral agents viral safety tests have not been 
performed.

Process characterisation was carried out to identify Critical Process Parameters (CPPs) and acceptance 
ranges and to further develop process knowledge. Risk assessments were performed to identify process 
variables for evaluation and relevant response factors for given manufacturing process steps. A quality by 
design (QbD) concept was introduced during process development in order to define the relationship 
between Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) and CPPs and to define the associated acceptance ranges for 
the CPPs. 
The process parameters and in-process controls in place for routine control of the manufacturing process 
are adequately described in the dossier. The definition of the overall control strategy has been sufficiently 
justified and it was supported by Design of Experiments (DoE) studies. CPPs and their respective 
acceptance criteria have been identified and the rationale substantiating the proposed control strategy 
has been presented. A CPP is defined as a process parameter whose variability has an impact on a critical 
quality attribute and therefore should be monitored or controlled to ensure the process produces the 
desired quality. The assessment of risk is based on a combination of factors that include equipment design 
considerations, process control capability and complexity, the size and reliability of the design space, 
ability to detect/measure a parameter deviation, etc. Non-Critical Process Parameters (NCPPs) are 
defined as adjustable parameters (variable) of the process that does not have a meaningful effect on 
product quality or process performance. 
The approach taken to define Normal Operating Ranges (NORs) is accepted as being not standard. The 
NORs/Proven Acceptable Ranges (PARs)/acceptance ranges were established on the basis of simulations 
or edge of failure experiments. The term NOR is used to define acceptable operating ranges within the 
defined PARs. A design space is not claimed. The term “NOR” retained in the dossier is acceptable based 
on the confirmation that NORs will only be varied in a univariate manner. All NORs fall within their final 
acceptable respective PARs. The PARs are in line with the characterised ranges established at Design of 
Experiments (DoE) and with additional data where necessary. The NORs will be applied in routine 
operation and PARs will only be used as part of a careful quality assessment in the event of an out of 
specification (NOR). 
A comprehensive overview of critical in-process controls and critical in-process tests performed 
throughout the active substance manufacturing process is given. Acceptable information has been 
provided on the control system in place to monitor and control the active substance manufacturing 
process with regard to critical, as well as non-critical operational parameters and in-process tests. Actions 
taken if limits are exceeded are specified. 
Process validation 
The active substance manufacturing process has been validated adequately. Consistency in production 
has been shown on three full scale commercial batches. All acceptance criteria for the critical operational 
parameters and likewise acceptance criteria for the in-process tests are fulfilled demonstrating that the 
purification process consistently produces the active substance of reproducible quality that complies with 
the predetermined specification and in-process acceptance criteria. 
Extractables/leachables for the primary packaging container have been adequately addressed. 
Manufacturing process development 
Minor changes were introduced during development of the active substance manufacturing process for 
process optimization. No major changes affecting the quality, safety and efficacy of Botulinum toxin, Type 
A have been implemented in the manufacturing process since it was validated. The same process was 
used to manufacture the batches of active substance that were used in the manufacture of finished 
product batches that were evaluated in the non-clinical studies and clinical studies. The comparability of 
the active substance has been verified and sufficiently justified. 
EMA/281737/2019 
Page 16/131 
 
 
  
 
 
Characterisation 
The active substance was extensively characterized for structural, physicochemical, and functional 
comparability with the wild type toxin. 
The structure and composition were determined using a number of analyses. 
Amino acid composition was carried out by analysis of the N-terminal amino acid structure which was 
compared to the N-terminal amino acid sequence of Botulinum toxin, Type A reported in the literature and 
found to be identical. 
Primary structure was confirmed using amino acid sequence analysis by LC-MS/MS, identification of 
free-thiol groups by LC-MS/MS, position and maintenance of disulfide bridges under both non-reducing 
and reducing conditions by SDS-PAGE analysis and LC-MS/MS. 
Secondary structure prediction program was used to predict the secondary structure of 7 subunits based 
on known amino acid sequence of Botulinum toxin, Type A. The amino acid secondary structure of the 
active substance subunits was compared with reference structures and found to be consistent. 
Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy was used to examine the folding/unfolding nature of the protein and 
assess secondary and tertiary structures of the protein.  
Tertiary structure was confirmed by cryo-electron microscopy by capturing the microscopic image of the 
active substance and examining its surface structure. 
The result obtained from the active substance showed tertiary structures in which 2 of the 3 arms were 
resolved and shown to be consistent with the published literature. 
Tertiary structure was further confirmed using a light scattering machine connected to Fast Performance 
Liquid Chromatography (FPLC) was used to examine the molecular weight and polydispersity. 
Size-exclusion chromatography was conducted by enabling the fractionated sample to pass through Multi 
Angle Light Scattering (MALS) equipment in order to measure the absolute molecular weight. The purity 
of the active substance was confirmed and its sedimentation activity was associated with misfolded chains 
and oligomeric state in the solution. 
The average molecular weight of 3 batches of the active substance was confirmed to be 901.4 kDa and the 
average polydispersity value of 3 batches of the active substance was confirmed. Accordingly, the 
measured molecular weight of 3 batches of the active substance was confirmed to be no different than the 
theoretical molecular weight obtained from amino acid sequence that is approximately 900 kDa.  
The active substance protein in the crystal form was analyzed by X-ray diffraction.  
Physiochemical properties examined were: UV Spectrum, electrophoretic pattern, molecular weight or 
size by mass spectrometry and patterns and purity of the active substance by size-exclusion high 
performance liquid chromatography. 
Immunological characterization was analyzed using a western blot technique. Biological activity for the 
active substance was evaluated through in vivo activity using a mouse LD50 test.  
Toxic Complex mass and protein aggregate levels of the active substance were analysed using an 
analytical ultracentrifuge technique. Based on the analytical results the molecular mass of the active 
substance was estimated to be 900 kDa. The results indicated that sedimentation equilibrium exists in the 
dimer, as illustrated in Figure 3. 
Botulinum Toxin, Type A is composed of dimer structures consisting of neurotoxin, NTNH (non-toxic, 
non-haemagglutinin) protein covalently bonded with HA (haemagglutinin) proteins (HA50, HA33, HA20, 
and HA17).  
EMA/281737/2019 
Page 17/131 
 
 
  
 
 
The cleavage of covalent bonds in the dimer structures results in the molecular weight of the monomer 
structures of approximately 500 kDa consisting of neurotoxin, NTNH proteins and HA proteins (HA50, 
HA33, HA20, and HA17). The monomer structure of approximate 300 kDa consists of neurotoxin and 
NTNH proteins.  
Figure 2: Structure of Botulinum Toxin Type A 
The active substance has been appropriately characterised in relation to structural, physicochemical and 
functional comparability against theoretically expected values for a Botulinum toxin, Type A. An 
impurities characterisation study was also carried out to evaluate the product and process related 
impurities relevant for the active substance. The data presented relates to characterisation studies 
performed on a number of batches manufactured from the MCB between 2011 and 2014. Extended 
characterisation, including an evaluation of impurity profile, has been provided for WCB derived active 
substance in order to verify the comparability of the active substance from the MCB and the active 
substance derived from the WCB. 
The product related impurities observed during the manufacturing stages have been identified and 
characterised using chromatographic and mass spectrometric tools.  
The depletion of process related impurities during routine manufacture was also evaluated and a high 
level of clearance demonstrated. The methods used to determine clearance of process related impurities, 
have been confirmed as being suitable for their intended purpose. The potential for host cell proteins as 
a process related impurity has been discussed. SDS-PAGE analysis demonstrates that background host 
cell proteins (HCPs) are present in samples from the main culture, as expected, but that they are 
progressively removed through the process steps. While SDS-PAGE is not the most sensitive of methods 
for the detection of HCPs, the reference to compliance of the active substance with the Ph. Eur. 
monograph is noted and taking into account the toxin content per drug product vial the potential for HCPs 
to represent a relevant impurity is negligible. 
Specification 
The parameters for controlling the quality of the active substance are derived by taking into consideration 
the Ph. Eur. monograph for Botulinum toxin, Type A for Injection.  
These tests and specifications are applied for release of each batch of active substance and also for 
stability testing of the active substance. 
The specifications for control of the active substance are based on pharmacopoeial standards (Ph. Eur. 
monograph Botulinum toxin, Type A), solution properties, manufacturing process capabilities and 
EMA/281737/2019 
Page 18/131 
 
 
  
 
 
 
comparison to several reference product batches. The specifications are appropriate for control of this 
type of the active substance. 
The neurotoxin content in terms of protein should ideally be measured by a product-specific stability 
indicating analytical method that reflects the current state of the art. This assay should also be included 
in the stability testing and in the control of the reference standards. The general protein content assay is 
however acceptable at this time but a recommendation is made that a suitable stability indicating 
analytical method that measures the Botulinum toxin type A (BoNTA) specific protein content of the active 
substance and finished product should be developed and implemented during the post-marketing lifecycle 
of the finished product. 
It is also recommended to monitor active substance batches for any trend in aggregate levels. Depending 
on the outcome of the trend analysis in further batches the specification for aggregates could be removed 
or tightened, as appropriate, by way of variation. 
The CHMP raised ethical concerns regarding routine control of biological activity by means of the LD50 
assay. While this method is currently described in Ph. Eur., as the reference method for the potency assay 
of Botulinum toxin A, the monograph also explicitly recommends Applicants to develop alternative 
methods to be validated against this LD50 reference method, in accordance with the principles of Directive 
2010/63/EU on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes. 
As a post authorisation measure, the cell-based potency assay (CBPA) should be registered by way of 
variation with appropriate supportive documentation. In conclusion, in accordance with Directive 
2010/63/EU on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes an appropriate in vitro potency 
assay should be developed and validated in order to reduce or replace the use of animals for the purpose 
of routine release of the finished product. Anticipated implementation is September 2020. This point is 
included as condition to the marketing authorisation of Nuceiva. 
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines.  
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data is provided for 19 commercial scale batches. The results are within the specifications 
and confirm consistency of the manufacturing process. 
Reference materials 
A two-tiered reference standard system is in use and information is provided in relation to a range of 
primary and working reference standards. The primary reference standard for the active substance is 
used to qualify subsequent primary reference standards and the active substance working reference 
standards which are used routinely for release of batches. 
Stability 
The stability results indicate that the active substance is sufficiently stable and justify the proposed shelf 
life in the proposed container. 
Data is provided at the long-term storage condition; 36 months data is available for 3 batches of the 
active substance. All acceptance criteria are met.  
The proposed shelf life of 36 months when stored is accepted.  
The parameters tested are the same as for release.

2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is a sterile, white to yellowish, preservative free, vacuum dried powder containing 
100 units of Botulinum Toxin, Type A (active substance), 0.5 mg of human serum albumin (stabilizing 
agent), and 0.9 mg of sodium chloride (isotonic agent). 
The powder is reconstituted with commercially available, preservative free, 0.9% sodium chloride 
compliant with the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) and/or European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) to form 
a clear, transparent solution as per the directions for use. 
The qualitative and quantitative composition of the finished product is summarized in Table 3. 
The primary packaging is a type I glass vial fitted with a chlorobutyl rubber stopper and aluminium seal. 
The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The primary glass vial container and rubber 
stopper are supported by extractable studies from the supplier. Container closure integrity studies and 
microbial challenge studies also support the use of the selected closure system. The choice of the 
container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the 
product. 
During the procedure CHMP raised concerns regarding the 100 U presentation, which is not considered to 
be in line with the maximum dose to be administered associated with this submission (20 U). The intent 
to extend the indications to potentially include lateral canthal lines and forehead lines utilizing a higher 
dose up to 65 U has been indicated and would support the use of the 100 U vial presentation in the future. 
The immediate concern is being addressed with the development and qualification of a more appropriate 
50 U vial presentation for which a timeline for key deliverables up until its introduction has been provided. 
The introduction of a new vial size is expected within three months from the Commission Decision. The 
complexities associated with manufacturing a low dose vial due to low active substance content were 
presented by the applicant and acknowledged by CHMP. In order to mitigate the risk of incorrect 
administration the applicant has proposed warnings in the SPC section 4.3, 4.4 and 6.6. The wording 
proposed is considered to be acceptable to flag for healthcare professionals that each vial is to be used for 
a single patient only and that any unused material must be discarded. Incorrect administration due to the 
100 U vial was identified as safety concern in the risk management plan (see section 2.7 of this Report). 
CHMP requested the applicant to submit the line extension application for the 50 U vial accompanied by 
appropriate supporting documentation within three months form the Commission decision. This point is 
further discussed later in this report. 
Comparability of the clinical and commercial batches has been satisfactorily demonstrated using batch 
release data, comparative stability data and comparative in-process controls (IPC) data. 
All excipients comply with the requirements of the Ph. Eur. Human serum albumin (HSA) is manufactured 
from plasma which is supported by a Plasma Master File. HSA is used as a stabiliser to reduce binding of 
the active substance botulinum toxin to the container surface. Confirmation that the shelf-life of albumin 
will be synchronised with the expiry date of the medical product in accordance with 
EMA/CHMP/BWP/706271/2010 is provided. 
Selected quality by design (QbD) studies have been conducted by the finished product manufacturer in 
the current manufacturing facility at the proposed commercial batch size. Those studies ascertained the 
relationship between critical quality attributes (CQAs) and critical process parameters (CPPs) and define 
acceptable ranges for CPPs during the following key steps of the finished product manufacturing process 
(i.e. final bulk preparation process, filtration, immediate storage, filling processes and vacuum drying).  
EMA/281737/2019 
Page 20/131 
 
 
  
 
 
A Design Space has not been claimed, however design space studies have been submitted in support of 
the process parameter ranges for formulation and vacuum drying. The control strategy for the finished 
product during lifecycle has been addressed.  
Normal operating ranges (NORs) and proven acceptable ranges (PARs) have been defined for the CPPs, 
and these ranges have generally been adequately justified from the data provided.  
In-use studies with the proposed diluent (0.9% sterile saline solution) were performed and demonstrated 
physico-chemical stability up to 72 hours. As the final formulation does not contain a preservative, from 
a microbiological perspective in-use storage should be restricted to no greater than 24 hours when stored 
at 2-8ºC. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product is manufactured at Daewoong Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Republic of Korea and 
released on the market at Millmount Healthcare Ltd, Ireland or Biotec Services International Ltd, United 
Kingdom.  
The finished product manufacturing process involves preparation and release of materials, formulation, 
sterile filtration, aseptic filling, vacuum drying, capping (sealing), and packaging for final visual inspection 
and storage of the vials at refrigerated temperatures. The manufacturing process is a standard aseptic 
process. Final bulk can be held after formulation and prior to filtration in the agitation container. Filtered 
final bulk can be held after the second filtration in the intermediate storage bag. The excipients added to 
the active substance include human serum albumin (HSA), sodium chloride (NaCl) and water for injection 
(WFI).  
In-process controls 
The finished product is manufactured by adding the active substance to an excipient solution consisting of 
0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl) and 0.5% human serum albumin (HSA) in water for injection (WFI). The 
finished product is manufactured under standard aseptic manufacturing procedures, and is controlled by 
in-process controls (IPCs). There are no intermediates in the manufacturing process.  
The finished product manufacturing process has been validated using 3 consecutive commercial scale 
batches processed at Daewoong Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.’s site using the same process and equipment as 
intended for commercial use.  
The process validation batches were produced using the validated aseptic manufacturing process in full 
compliance with cGMP procedures.  
The aseptic process used for sterilization has been validated by media fills. The process will continuously 
be re-validated approximately every 6 months.  
The sterilization and validation information confirms the validation of the manufacturing process and 
qualification of equipment for manufacturing of the finished product.  
The manufacturing process has been validated. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process 
is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process 
controls are adequate. 
Product specification  
The finished product specifications include tests for: appearance pre-reconstitution and 
post-reconstitution (visual inspection), identity (ELISA), potency (Ph. Eur.), total protein (Ph. Eur.), 
neurotoxin content (ELISA), particulate contamination (Ph. Eur.), sub-visible particles (Ph. Eur.), pH (Ph. 
EMA/281737/2019 
Page 21/131 
 
 
  
 
 
Eur.), water determination (Ph. Eur.), solubility (in house), sterility (Ph. Eur.), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. 
Eur.). 
Justifications for the release and end of shelf life specifications for the finished product are based on 
pharmacopoeial standards, solution properties, device functionality criteria, manufacturing process 
capabilities and comparisons to and systematic analysis of several reference product batches. Limits are 
set based on data collected and monitored with the generation of additional stability data and may be 
modified, as required. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-based 
approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Based on the risk assessment it can 
be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls in the finished product 
specification. The information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory. 
See the discussion above in the active substance regarding the potency assay. 
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data on commercial scale batches of the finished product were provided. The results are 
within the specifications and confirm consistency of the manufacturing process.  
Reference materials 
See the discussion above in the active substance regarding the reference materials. 
Stability of the product 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 30 months when stored at 5°C ± 3°C as stated 
in the SmPC are acceptable. 
Real time/real condition stability data of 3 pilot and 4 commercial scale batches of finished product for up 
to 36 months at the long-term storage condition (5°C ± 3°C) and for up to 6 months under accelerated 
conditions at 25°C ± 2°C/60% ± 5% relative humidity, according to ICH guidelines were provided. The 
batches of medicinal product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the 
primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
The parameters tested are the same as for release. 
In addition, 2 batches were exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. Based on results it was concluded that the product was stable for 150 
hours under tested photostability conditions. 
In-use stability of 3 batches were assessed at 5ºC ± 3ºC following reconstitution in sterile sodium chloride 
injection. The results indicated that there was no change in the appearance, pH and potency of the 
finished product over the course of the stability study. Based on these results it was concluded that the 
product was physically and chemically stable after reconstitution for 72 hours at 5ºC ± 3ºC. 
A stress conditions study for 2 batches was conducted at 40ºC ± 2ºC/75 ± 5% RH for 14 and 28 days. The 
data shows that both batches had a decrease in potency but remained within specifications, consequently 
it was determined that there was no significant change during storage at 40 ºC ± 2ºC/75% ± 5% RH over 
EMA/281737/2019 
Page 22/131 
 
 
  
 
 
the applied testing frequency for either batch. Continued testing of one batch is being conducted out to 24 
weeks to further examine the trend in decreased potency.  
Adventitious agents 
Information on TSE/BSE risk has been provided in the dossier. Microbiological and fungal contamination 
risks have been adequately addressed. In relation to viral risk, as Clostridium botulinum is an unsuitable 
host for infectious viral agents, it is not necessary to perform viral safety tests on the MCB and WCB. The 
justification to not conduct studies to demonstrate the absence of phage contamination in the MCB and 
WCB is accepted. The applicant has provided the reports for the viral clearance studies on the active 
substance manufacturing process. Justification for small scale models used during viral clearance studies 
and how they remain representative of commercial scale processes is provided. 
GMO 
Not applicable. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the active substance and the finished 
product and their manufacturing process. 
However, no design spaces were claimed for the manufacturing process of the active substance, nor for 
the finished product. 
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no 
impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product.  
The CHMP raised ethical concerns regarding routine control of biological activity by means of the LD50 
assay. While this method is currently described in Ph. Eur., as the reference method for the potency assay 
of Botulinum toxin A, the monograph also explicitly recommends Applicants to develop alternative 
methods to be validated against this LD50 reference method, in accordance with the principles of 
Directive 2010/63/EU on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes. 
The CHMP raised concerns regarding the 100 U presentation, which is not considered to be in line with the 
maximum dose to be administered associated with this submission (20 U). The complexities associated 
with manufacturing a low dose vial due to low active substance content were presented by the applicant 
and acknowledged by the CHMP. Nonetheness, the feasibility of a more suitable 50 U formulation was 
agreed by CHMP and the applicant. The immediate concern on multiple use/incorrect use with the 100 U 
vial is therefore expected to be addressed with the development and qualification of a more appropriate 
50 U vial presentation. A timeline for key deliverables up until the introduction of this new presentation 
has been provided. The applicant has committed to have completed the development of and submitted 
the 50 U vial line extension accompanied by appropriate supporting documentation within three months 
form the Commission decision. 
EMA/281737/2019 
Page 23/131 
 
 
  
 
 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented 
to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
In accordance with Directive 2010/63/EU on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes an 
appropriate in vitro potency assay should be developed and validated in order to reduce or replace the use 
of animals for the purpose of routine release of the finished product, no later than September 2020. This 
point is included as condition to marketing authorisation. 
In order to mitigate the risk of incorrect administration the applicant has proposed warnings in the SPC 
section 4.3, 4.4 and 6.6. The wording proposed is considered to be acceptable to flag for healthcare 
professionals that each vial is to be used for a single patient only and that any unused material must be 
discarded. Incorrect administration due to the 100 U vial was identified as a safety concern in the risk 
management plan (see section 2.7 of this Report). The applicant should submit the line extension 
application for the 50 U vial accompanied by appropriate supporting documentation within three months 
form the Commission decision. 
Recommendations for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends several points for investigation. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The drug product, DWP-450, comprises of 100 U of Botulinum toxin, Type A (produced by Clostridium 
botulinum) complexed with 0.5 mg human serum albumin (HSA) and 0.9 mg sodium chloride.  The final 
drug  product  is  vacuum-dried  and  packaged  in  a  single  use,  transparent  10  ml  glass  vial;  each  vial 
contains 100 Units Botulinum toxin, Type A and the concentration of the drug product is 40 U/ml or 4 
U/0.1 ml after reconstitution with 2.5 ml of sterile non-preserved saline.  It is intended for injection at a 
maximum clinical dose of 20 units (U) to be administered no more frequently than at 3 month intervals. 
Initially,  DWP-450  was  developed  by  Daewoong  Pharmaceuticals,  South  Korea  as  a  product  that  was 
comparable to the marketed Botulinum toxin, Type A biologic product, Botox® (Onabotulinum toxin A, 
MAH Allergan, US). Commercially available Botulinum toxin, Type A products such as Botox® have an 
extensive  history  of  clinical  use.  Therefore  a  literature  review  was  conducted  for  some  of  the 
pharmacological, pharmacokinetic and toxicological aspects. In addition, pharmacology and toxicology 
studies were conducted with DWP-450 to support the Biologic License Application (BLA) submitted to the 
Korean  Ministry  of  Food  and  Drug  Safety.  The  initial  BLA  (100 U)  was  approved  for  the  treatment  of 
moderate to severe glabellar lines in November 2013. Consequently, additional non-clinical studies were 
conducted  to  evaluate  the  potential  impact  of  these  changes  and  to  bridge  the  existing  non-clinical 
toxicity and safety dataset to the final commercial product. 
Hence, the non-clinical package comprises of data from the literature, and non-clinical studies conducted 
with  DWP-450  Drug  substance  or  various  forms  of  DWP-450  Drug  product.    Scientific  advice  of  a 
non-clinical  nature  was  provided  by  UK  in  June  2014,  Denmark  in  December  2015  and  the  CHMP  in 
February 2016. 
EMA/281737/2019 
Page 24/131 
 
 
  
 
 
 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Literature data suggest that the heavy chain of Botulinum toxin, Type A binds to the presynaptic motor 
neuron and aids internalisation, while the light chain cleaves synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP 
25) in the cholinergic nerve terminal and prevents the anchor of vesicles to the membrane along with the 
release of acetylcholine into the synapse of peripheral neuromuscular junctions.  However, no in vitro 
pharmacology studies were carried out by the applicant.  The applicant demonstrated that the predicted 
amino acid sequences for the active substance within Botox® (Botulinum toxin, Type A) and DWP-450 
were identical.   
In vivo pharmacology studies were conducted in order to evaluate and compare the efficacy and potency 
of the DWP-450 DP to that of commercially available Botox®, and to evaluate potential changes in 
DWP-450 DP pharmacological characteristics which may have resulted from a change in manufacturing 
sites.  
The principal characteristic of botulism in the conventional electromyograph is a diminished amplitude of 
the compound muscle action potential (cMAP) in response to a supramaximal stimulus to a nerve.  Data 
in the literature suggest that latencies and conduction velocities are normal and thus not affected by 
Botulinum toxin, Type A.  Hence, the applicant has provided the results of studies which evaluate the 
pharmacological effects of DWP-450.   
In an initial study in the rat, the in vivo potency of DWP-450 was compared to that of Botox® [Study 
DWP450-REP-041].  A single intramuscular injection of DWP-450-GC-OL at 2, 4 and 8 U prior to sciatic 
nerve stimulation caused a significant reduction in cMAP amplitude (i.e. myoparalysis) which was evident 
from 3 days post-injection, reached its maximum at 1 week and continued to significantly reduce cMAP 
amplitude up until the 4-week timepoint (where the beginning of recovery was apparent). Intramuscular 
administration of Botox® at the same doses, caused reductions of cMAP amplitude of a similar magnitude.  
There were isolated incidences where the responses to lyophilised DWP-450 were of a different magnitude 
to Botox®; however, the observed differences were not consistent across the dose and time ranges 
studied. 
A separate cMAP assay was conducted to bridge/compare DWP-450 DP-OV (vacuum-dried drug product 
manufactured in the original facility) to that of DWP-450-C (DWP-450 DP manufactured in the current 
facility) [Study EVL-MDD-16-001].  It was evident that a single intramuscular injection of DWP-450-OV or 
DWP-450-C at 1, 4 and 8 U prior to sciatic nerve stimulation caused a dose-related reduction in cMAP 
amplitude (i.e. myoparalysis) with a time course in line with that reported during the initial study.  
Although there was an instance at a single timepoint where the reduction in cMAP at 4 U, was not as 
pronounced for material manufactured in the new facility; overall, the reductions in cMAP amplitude 
observed with vacuum-dried drug product from the current facility (responsible for the production of the 
commercial product) was comparable to that observed with the original/old facility. No differences in 
latency were reported when comparing the two batches, an expected finding for the reason given above 
that Botulinum toxin, Type A does not affect latencies and conduction velocities.   In response to 
questions, the applicant confirmed that animals under anaesthesia were maintained at 30°C, and not at 
a lower ambient temperature, sufficient to avoid concerns that lower temperatures may affect distal 
latency in nerve conduction studies.  The applicant also addressed a concern raised to the effect that 
Botox® was included in the study as a reference standard but no comparison was made between the 
proposed formulation of Nuceiva intended to be marketed and Botox®.  The applicant provided a 
statistical comparison: this did suggest some points of statistical difference but as the sample size was 
limited (n=4), the biological significance of this was discounted and the conclusion of assessment was 
that the statistical analysis requested supported that the pharmacological properties of DWP-450 appear 
consistent with those of Botox®.  Actual effects on cMAP amplitude were provided on request.

No safety pharmacology studies have been conducted with DWP-450 DP; this is acceptable and in 
accordance with ICH S6 (R1) guideline.  Effects to the core organ systems are expected to be the same as 
seen with Botox®.  This includes a concern to the effect that some types of Botulinum Toxin Type A 
undergo retrograde axonal transport and may affect the Central Nervous System (CNS).  Breathing 
difficulties and respiratory impairment, which can be life threatening, have been reported for Botulinum 
toxin, Type A.  Risks to the respiratory and central nervous systems have been addressed by way of the 
SmPC.   
No drug-drug interaction studies were carried out or identified in the literature for Botulinum toxin, Type 
A.  As Botulinum toxin has anticholinergic effects, interactions may be expected with concomitant use of 
other anticholinergic drugs. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The applicant did not conduct any studies to demonstrate the pharmacokinetic profile of DWP-450 as it 
was considered that the development of reproducible, reliable, precise and accurate analytical methods 
was not feasible.  This was due to the (i) complex nature of the product, (ii) sensitivity of the methods 
required to detect free toxin given the (low) predicted exposures and (iii) lack of reliable reference 
standards if concentrations of the free toxin were to be determined.  Severe toxicity would be expected if 
there is systemic exposure at amounts where it can be detected.  On the other hand, at tolerable doses, 
serum concentrations of DWP-450 (0.0002 ng/ml might be projected) would be far lower than currently 
available detection capabilities.  It is noted that the appropriate analysis was therefore not performed for 
dose formulations utilised during the non-clinical studies and within the non-clinical overview (Module 
2.4), the applicant suggests that the potency of the dose formulations was assessed (in vivo with the aid 
of the cMAP bioassay) instead. 
In the absence of analytical methods, the conduct of absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion 
studies was not feasible.  The applicant therefore relied upon data from the literature to describe the 
pharmacokinetic aspects for Botulinum Toxin, Type A. 
The only relevant information in the public domain was a published study which described the distribution 
of 125I-labelled free/complexed Botulinum toxin, Type A following injection into the rat gastrocnemius 
muscle [Tang Liu et al, 2003].  Some spread of radioactivity to sites distal to the injected site was 
observed; significant amounts were recovered from thyroid, contralateral muscle, and skin and a higher 
rate of dispersal was observed for the free toxin.  However, the radioactivity at the distal sites did not 
appear to represent intact neurotoxin associated with macromolecules such as proteins, DNA and RNA [as 
most of it could not be precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (TCA)].  Less than 1% of the injected dose of 
125I-Botulinum toxin, Type A complex or free-125I-Botulinum toxin, Type A was measured at any time 
point in the sciatic nerve, lungs, kidneys, or brain, and most of the material could not be TCA precipitated.  
The data therefore demonstrate that almost no radioactivity was localized to the brain, which suggests 
that intramuscular injection administration of (free or) complexed Botulinum toxin, Type A should not be 
associated with significant effects on the central nervous system.  Both 125I-labeled peptides and 
125I-iodide arising from the metabolic breakdown of the radiolabelled free/complexed neurotoxin were 
primarily excreted in the urine (most were not TCA precipitable). 
It is acknowledged that interpretation of the distribution of radioactivity is limited as radiolabelled 
TCA-precipitable proteins were not tested for toxin activity.  However, despite these limitations, overall, 
the data suggest that following injection of complexed Botulinum toxin, Type A into rat gastrocnemius 
muscle, the majority of the neurotoxin remained at the site of intramuscular injection; this is consistent 
with the high affinity binding of Botulinum toxin, Type A to specific receptors and expected minimal 
EMA/281737/2019 
Page 26/131 
 
 
  
 
 
 
diffusion of toxin away from the injection site [Carli et al, 2009].  The low potential for dispersal from the 
injection site is an important clinical consideration and suggests a low risk for adverse events.   
However, there was no mention in the Tang-Liu et al (2003) study of clinical manifestations of acute 
toxicity in animals.  More recent publicly available preclinical literature suggests catalytically active 
Botulinum toxin, Type A can be actively transported by neurones away from the injection site (Antonucci 
et al., 2008).  Moreover, in vivo rat and mouse studies have shown a decrease in cMAP amplitude and grip 
strength in the contralateral limb to the injection site.   
In conclusion, despite the fact that the conduct of pharmacokinetic studies was not feasible and the 
information in the scientific literature was limited, the nature of the information presented was relevant to 
the proposed use and was considered to be adequate. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
It is acknowledged that the non-clinical program consisted of studies by two separate companies and that 
several studies were needed to support the various manufacturing changes. 
Toxicity studies were in line with ICH S6 (R1) in rats and dogs with all using intramuscular dosing, as 
intended in humans.  Based on known biological properties of Botulinum toxin A, rats were considered to 
be the most relevant species for toxicological evaluation. 
Single dose toxicity 
Initially, a single-dose study was conducted, whereby DWP 450 drug substance (no HSA) up to 500 U/kg 
was injected into the rat gastrocnemius muscle.  Mortality was observed at the maximum dose tested 
(5/5 males and 4/5 females), the most evident clinical signs were paralytic gait and abdominal distension 
on the injection side (which occurred within 1 day of injection) and a number of other clinical signs were 
observed including curling of the injected hind leg and prolapse of the penis.  Microscopically, atrophy of 
the injected muscle fibres was observed at ≥50 U/kg and atrophy of the seminiferous tubules was noted 
at 200 U/kg. 
Subsequently, a single dose study was conducted in the same species, to compare the effects of the drug 
product to that of Botox®.  Interestingly, for both forms of Botulinum toxin, Type A, high rates of mortality 
were observed (90-100%) at ≥100 U/kg (doses that were not shown to be lethal during the first study, 
which was conducted with the drug substance at a different facility).  At all doses, i.e. at ≥5 U/kg, impaired 
limb function (related to pharmacology of test article) and reduced food intake/bodyweight were 
observed.  Other observations included dehydration at ≥50 U/kg and loss of righting reflex at ≥100 U/kg.  
Microscopic findings within the testes (unilateral degeneration/atrophy of the seminiferous tubules) were 
noted at ≥5 U/kg for both test articles i.e. at doses lower than that observed during the first study.  The 
applicant has suggested that the no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) for this study is 5 U/kg for 
males and 50 U/kg in females.  The CHMP does not agree with the designation of this NOAEL, given the 
findings in males, where the observed tubular degeneration within the testes was marked as severe in 
1/10 animals at 5 U/kg. 
A comparative (single dose) study was also performed in dogs.  Clinical observations were limited to 
intermittent vocalisation at 500 U/kg (for both lyophilised drug product, DWP-450-OL and Botox®) and 
histologically, minimum to mild inflammation was noted at the injection site at all doses administered (
≥5 U/kg).  The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the NOAEL were considered to be 500 U/kg and 200 
U/kg, respectively. 
EMA/281737/2019 
Page 27/131 
 
 
  
 
 
Repeat dose toxicity 
In repeat-dose general toxicity studies in rats, the first such study used weekly injections of DWP-450 DS 
into the left gastrocnemius muscle at 4, 12 and 32 U/kg for 4-weeks: this was associated with impaired 
left (injected) hind limb function (paralytic gait), curling of the left hind toes and abdominal distension 
(left side).  Reductions in body weight were noted at ≥12 U/kg and decreased food consumption occurred 
at the maximum dose tested only.  Reductions in the left (injected) and right (contralateral) 
gastrocnemius muscle weight along with bilateral muscular atrophy and/or inflammatory cell infiltration 
were noted at all doses; the microscopic findings were still apparent at the end of the 14-day recovery 
period.  At the maximum dose tested, small right testis and small epididymis was noted and associated 
with atrophy of seminiferous tubules, inhibition of spermiation and increased cell debris in lumen of the 
epididymis.  With the exception of the effects on the testes, all other effects related to the pharmacology 
of the toxin [Choi et al., 2007].  The testicular and epididymal effects are also likely linked to dysfunctional 
muscles as a result of the paralysis-inducing effect of Botulinum toxin, Type A.  Hence, the NOAEL was 
considered to be 12 U/kg and 32 U/kg in males and females, respectively. 
In a subsequent study, the effects of drug product were compared to that of Botox® at 30 and 60 U/kg in 
the rat.  Following repeated weekly intramuscular administration for 5 weeks, mortality was observed 
(one female given Botox at 60 U/kg).  For both DWP-450-OL and Botox® at ≥30 U/kg, clinical observations 
included paralytic gait of the left (injected) hind limb, left abdominal distention, and curling of the toes of 
the left hind limb and other intermittent observations of emaciation, weakening and/or irregular 
respiration).  Decreased body weight and food intake decreased gastrocnemius weights with muscle fibre 
atrophy, and the testicular and epididymal findings were noted as observed during previous studies; 
these histological findings were still apparent after a 12-week recovery period.  Bone changes included 
proliferation of the periosteum in the diaphysis and metaphysis of the thigh; and decreased trabecular 
bone and were the result of the impaired muscle function (these were partially reversible).  The overall 
findings as observed were slightly less severe than those observed at comparable doses of Botox® on the 
basis of the observed mortality and effects on the testis.  The NOAEL was determined to be <30 U/kg for 
males, and 60 U/kg for females, under the conditions of this study. 
After acquisition of DWP-450, the applicant subsequently conducted a 4-week rat study to evaluate the 
effects of the drug product, DWP-450-OL at 4, 8 and 32 U/kg.  Four repeated weekly intramuscular 
injections into the left biceps femoris muscle were well tolerated at 4 and 8 U/kg.  However, the batch of 
lyophilised drug product evaluated appeared to have more profound effects than those documented for 
the (batches of drug substance and) batch of lyophilised product tested in the other repeat dose toxicity 
study.  Administration of 32 U/kg was associated with premature mortality and clinical signs of toxicity 
including impaired limb function, hunched posture, splayed limbs swelling in the anogenital region, 
decreased hydration and decreased activity along with those previously described.  Minimal-to- severe 
muscle atrophy in the left injection site and surrounding muscles and right (contralateral) biceps femoris 
was noted in males and females at ≥4 U/kg.  In addition, there was unilateral degeneration / atrophy of 
seminiferous tubules in the testes, mild-to-severe unilateral oligospermia / germ cell debris in the 
epididymis and a mild decrease in secretory product in the prostate gland in males at 32 U/kg.  Given the 
severity of these findings, the NOAEL was considered to be 8 U/kg. 
The applicant conducted a further study, of longer duration in the same species, whereby drug product 
was administered via intramuscular injection to the left biceps femoris on 7 occasions, once a month for 
6 consecutive months at 4, 8 and 16 U/kg.  Mortality was evident in not only the 8 and 16 U/kg groups, 
but within the control group as well (n=1/16 males for each group) and the cause of death was unclear.  
The minimum dose of 4 U/kg was well tolerated.  As observed during previous studies, muscle atrophy 
and related changes were observed without significant effects on in-life parameters, organ or microscopic 
changes.  At ≥8 U/kg, impaired limb function, muscle wasting, and abdominal swelling correlated with 
EMA/281737/2019 
Page 28/131 
 
 
  
 
 
decreases in creatinine, small muscle weights and microscopic findings of myofibre atrophy of biceps 
femoris and skeletal muscles at the injection and contralateral sites; males were more affected than 
females.  In addition to atrophy, adipocytes were increased in number and filled spaces formerly occupied 
by myofibres.  Following the 2-month and 3-month recovery periods, at all dose levels, left side muscle 
atrophy was not reversible, while the contralateral right biceps femoris muscle atrophy was reversible at 
4 U/kg, and was decreased in incidence and/or severity at ≥8 U/kg.  However, the persistence of myofibre 
atrophy and increased adipocyte number in the injected muscle at ≥8 U/kg was considered adverse.  
Hence, the NOAEL was considered to be 4 U/kg. 
More recently, the applicant conducted a further study to evaluate the effects of vacuum dried product 
containing HSA product (DWP-450 DP-C) at the current manufacturing facility.  The findings were 
generally in line with those identified during previous studies.  At 32 U/kg, no mortality was observed on 
this occasion (whereas animals were euthanised following administration of the same dose of lyophilised 
drug product); however, cross study comparisons are difficult.  Repeated weekly injections of DWP-450 
DP-C into the left biceps femoris muscle was associated with limb impairment and associated reductions 
in body weight and food consumption.  At 32 U/kg, these effects were statistically significant and 
correlated with clinical signs of toxicity.  The microscopic indicators of muscle atrophy observed in and 
around the injection site (injected left biceps femoris muscle) although pharmacologically mediated, was 
considered adverse at all dose levels.  In addition, a local inflammatory response to the test article was 
noted in the tissues surrounding the left sciatic nerve at all doses. A NOAEL was therefore not identified 
during this study. 
The applicant also performed repeated-dose studies in the dog.  A dose-range finding study was 
conducted whereby DWP-450 drug substance was administered intramuscularly at 50, 100 and 200 U/kg, 
once weekly for 3 consecutive weeks.  Muscle fibre atrophy (in the injected muscle) was noted as the only 
treatment-related finding and the maximum dose recommended for the subsequent pivotal study was 
said to be 200 U/kg.  Interestingly, the maximum dose evaluated during the subsequent pivotal 4-week 
study was only 32 U/kg and the applicant failed to provide adequate justification for the dose selection; 
the histological findings (minimal to mild muscle fibre atrophy) were reproduced and shown to be 
reversible after 2 -week recovery period.  Although the dose evaluated is not considered to be sufficiently 
high, it is noted that this is the less sensitive species evaluated and thus, no further data are requested. 
Head-to head comparison single dose toxicity 
Given the slight differences as observed during the repeated-dose studies observed with different batches 
at different test facilities, the applicant performed a head-to head comparison of single doses of DWP 450 
that have been evaluated previously, along with Botox®.  Following single intramuscular injection, there 
were no apparent toxicologically significant differences between the test articles; this could indicate that 
the manufacturing process change had no effect on the biological activity and toxicological profile of the 
toxin, but it is possible that the study is not capable of detecting such differences.  In addition, neither of 
the DWP-450 test articles showed differences in toxicological profile to that of Botox®.  The NOAEL was 
determined to be 8 U/kg for DWP-450 in female SD rats. 
The applicant also performed a separate head to head comparison study, to compare the effects of a 
single dose of drug product from the original facility to product from the current facility.  Intramuscular 
injection of both test articles into the left biceps femoris produced clinical signs that were 
pharmacologically mediated and similar for the groups at 4 and 8 U/kg.  At the maximum dose tested, the 
test articles were not well tolerated and treatment was associated with adverse clinical observations, 
effects on body weight and food consumption and anatomical pathology changes as described previously.  
At termination on Day 15 (i.e. 14 days post-dose), the applicant noted a slightly higher incidence of mild 
atrophy of the injection site muscle in animals dosed with DWP-450 from the current facility when 
EMA/281737/2019 
Page 29/131 
 
 
  
 
 
compared to those dosed with DWP-450 from the original facility but came to the conclusion that the 
observed differences were not toxicologically significant.  However, it is noted that the differences 
observed between the DWP 450 from the current facility were consistently different with respect to 
significantly lower body weights, the macroscopic observation of smaller contralateral muscle, the trend 
towards a lower absolute and relative muscle weight and the microscopic findings indicative of atrophy in 
both the injected and the contralateral muscle.  The applicant addressed a question on this point and it is 
possible that the differences seen are not indicative of a true difference in profile of the product, but 
rather, the lack of effect in some animals may be due to administration errors.  
Some of the later studies were conducted only in female rats: as toxicity had been seen in male rats at 
lower doses in earlier studies, the applicant was required to explain the choice of use of female rats only 
in later studies.  The applicant was also asked to consider whether the toxicity seen in males could reflect 
systemic anticholinergic toxicity, possibly indicating biological consequences of the drug after it had 
distributed away from its local site of intramuscular injection.  On this latter point the applicant responded 
to the effect that its product was not different in this respect from the profile seen with other botulinum 
toxin preparations and clinical evidence of concern is lacking.  Thus it was concluded noting that for the 
indication sought and the location of the injection for glabellar lines in the face, the dose and the distance 
between the injection site and the groin area is large, there is no significant concern regarding diffusion 
for testicular effects.  On the latter of use only of females, the applicant explained that the choice to use 
females only reflected a desire to minimise the number of animals used and the information that might 
have been lost by so doing was considered minimal.  It might have been more relevant to consider use of 
males only, but the point was considered resolved as additional toxicity studies are not needed.   
Finally, the applicant was asked to justify a lack of immunogenicity evaluations.  Its response related that 
this was studied clinically and the applicant considered this to be sufficient.  Animal immunogenicity is 
accepted as not predictive of such effects in humans but the lack of evaluation of immunogenicity in 
animals might have undermined the evaluation of toxicity in animals.    
Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity 
No data from genotoxicity or carcinogenicity studies were provided. It is acceptable given the nature of 
the product and is in keeping with the recommendations of the ICH S6 (R1) guideline. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Data from the literature suggest that in rats, Botulinum toxin Type A (Botox) causes reduced fertility in 
males at 8 and 16 U/kg and in females at 16 U/kg.  No effects were reported at 4 U/kg and 8 U/kg in males 
and females, respectively.  However the potential impact of Nuceiva on fertility has not been investigated. 
The effect on fertility and the data are correctly reflected in the SmPC.   
An embryofetal development study was conducted in which pregnant rats were given DWP-450 DS drug 
substance (no HSA) via intramuscular injection into the left gastrocnemius muscle at 0, 0.5, 1 and 4 U/kg, 
once daily from Days 6 to 15 of gestation.  While some of the typical clinical signs were apparent, there 
were no effects on food consumption or body weight and no effects on embryofetal development were 
reported at 4 U/kg.  Peri and post-natal studies were not conducted, which is acceptable. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In accordance with the CHMP guideline for Environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for 
human use [EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2], as the proposed product falls within the classification of 
a products containing vitamins, electrolytes, amino acids, peptides, proteins, carbohydrates and lipids as 
active pharmaceutical ingredient(s), an environmental risk assessment (ERA) is not required. 
EMA/281737/2019 
Page 30/131 
 
 
  
 
 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the approach for the pharmacology aspects was deemed acceptable.  However, it is noted that in 
vivo testing was the only means by which the potency of the proposed product could be demonstrated.  
Development of an in vitro assay may have reduced the number of animals used but the use of in vivo 
methods can be accepted.  The applicant provided reassurance that the assay is sufficiently robust, noting 
low maintenance temperature used (22 or 23 ± 3°C); in fact, the description did not make clear that 
animals were maintained at 30°C, and at this temperature, an effect on neuromuscular junction function 
was not expected to be obscured.  The applicant also clarified that although effects on latency were 
observed sporadically, this parameter is not sensitive to effect of Botulinum Toxin Type A and was not 
used to provide evidence comparing Nuceiva with Botox.  The applicant also provided control data on 
cMAP and latency generated with Botox. 
No safety pharmacology studies have been conducted with DWP-450 DP; this is acceptable and in 
accordance with ICH S6 (R1) guideline.  Clinical data suggest potential risks to the cardiovascular, 
respiratory and central nervous systems. This is appropriately reflected in the Product Information and, 
from the non-clinical perspective, the issue has been considered satisfactory. 
The applicant did not conduct any studies to demonstrate the pharmacokinetic profile of DWP-450 as it 
was considered that the development of reproducible, reliable, precise and accurate analytical methods 
was not feasible.  It is noted that the appropriate analysis was therefore not performed for dose 
formulations utilised during the non-clinical studies.   
In order to bridge the bulk of the toxicology studies that were performed with drug product produced at 
older facilities, the applicant performed a separate head-to-head comparison study, to compare the 
effects of a single dose of vacuum dried drug product from the original facility (DWP-450 DP-OV) to 
vacuum dried product from the current facility (DWP-450 DP-C).  The applicant noted a slightly higher 
incidence of mild atrophy of the injection site muscle in animals dosed with DWP-450 DP-C when 
compared to those dosed with DWP-450 DP-OV but came to the conclusion that the observed differences 
were not toxicologically significant.  However, it is noted that the differences observed between the 
vacuum-dried product from the current facility were consistently different with respect to significantly 
lower body weights, the macroscopic observation of smaller contralateral muscle, the trend towards a 
lower absolute and relative muscle weight and the microscopic findings indicative of atrophy in both the 
injected and the contralateral muscle.  It is acknowledged that the differences are small.  However, 
comparison of a separate sensitive endpoint may have clarified whether the observed difference is likely 
to occur via chance.  Comparison of the effect on the testes would have been a useful tool to determine 
whether the vacuum-dried drug product is associated with a slightly different toxicity profile and a higher 
propensity for adverse events in the clinic but the applicant has conducted the comparative studies in 
females only. 
The applicant did not supply data from studies into immunogenicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity or 
reproductive toxicity.  This is acceptable, the product is considered to pose no risk to the environment. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the application is approvable from a non-clinical point of view.   
EMA/281737/2019

2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Glabellar lines at maximum frown are attributed to the (over-) activity of the underlying corrugator and 
procerus muscles.  
The applicant conducted a pivotal, European and Canadian efficacy and safety study EVB003, designed as 
an active treatment (Botox) and placebo controlled randomised trial of non-inferiority of a single 
treatment with DWP-450 for the temporary improvement in moderate to severe glabellar lines, where the 
adult subjects confirm their glabellar lines have an important psychological impact (on mood, anxiety 
and/or depressive symptoms).  
There are two supporting US safety and efficacy studies, EV001, EV002, designed as placebo superiority 
trials of single treatment with DWP-450 for the temporary improvement in moderate to severe glabellar 
lines.  
Two additional USA-performed safety studies, EV004, EV006, are also presented as open-label, repeat 
treatment studies of DWP-450 for the temporary improvement in moderate to severe glabellar lines.  
GCP 
The clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The lack of conventional PK studies was accepted by the CHMP during scientific advice, based on the 
evidence available. The justification for not carrying out clinical PK studies is based on the limitations of 
the available at the time assays for theoretical concentrations of 0.2 picograms/mL (200 femtograms/ml) 
and the absence of evidence that efficacy correlates with blood levels. It has since come to light that there 
are Botulinum toxin A assays in the femtogram range, including the BoNT ALISSA (Bagramyan et al., 
2008; Bagramayan et al., 2013). However this assay remains in the research phase and the actual 
accuracy is unclear.   
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Similarly, no pharmacodynamics studies were conducted in vitro or clinically such as receptor binding or 
attempts to correlate pharmacodynamic effects to dose or plasma concentrations, based on the 
understanding that there are no sensitive analytical methods to support this. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
No pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics studies were conducted. This was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP.  
EMA/281737/2019 
Page 33/131 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Following CHMP’s scientific advice in Feb 2016, EMA/CHMP/SAWP/130926/2016, accepting the absence 
of conventional PK studies, it has come to light that there are immunoassays available for botulinum toxin 
type A with a detection margin of >100 times the estimated blood concentrations. It is agreed that an 
appropriate assay for botulinum toxin blood levels would have helped to support the investigations of 
DWP-450 efficacy over safety, including the impact of Anti-Botulinum toxin A Antibodies (ADA). However 
the lack of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics studies is acceptable. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
Clinical efficacy data are provided on >2100 healthy subjects treated for Glabellar Lines (GLs) within the 
Evolus programme including 540 (DWP-450 = 245) subjects recruited to the pivotal single administration 
active comparator and placebo controlled European study; 654 (DWP-450 = 492) subjects across the 
single administration placebo-controlled US studies; and 912 (DWP-450 = 912) subjects in the open-label 
repeat administration US studies with exploratory efficacy endpoints.   
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
No clinical dose response studies were performed. The same Unit dose as Botox was selected with the 
justification of pharmacologic and non-clinical comparability, together with clinical comparability in the 
Korean clinical registration studies DWP-450 for the treatment of GL with Botox as an active comparator.  
The 3 controlled, single dose EV-001, EV-002 and EVB-003 studies used a single treatment of DWP-450 
as 5x 4U (0.1ml) i.m. doses.  
A comparison of effective doses for different botulinum toxin A preparations based on experimental 
models is problematic and does not accommodate potential differences in drug diffusion or spreading 
from the injection site.  
2.5.2.  Main studies 
Pivotal Study EVB003 
A phase III, multi-centre, randomised double blind, active and placebo control, single dose trial to 
demonstrate the efficacy and safety of DWP-450 in adult subjects for the treatment of 
moderate-to-severe glabellar lines. 
Methods 
Subjects were screened and assessed then block randomized in a 1:5:5 ratio to receive Placebo, BOTOX® 
or DWP-450 in a single treatment, with follow-up on days 2, 7, 14, 30 and then every 30 days to day 150.  
Study Participants  
Participants were selected from healthy adults age >18 years 
Entry criteria were moderate (GLS=2) to severe (GLS=3) glabellar lines at maximum frown as assessed 
by the investigator using the 4-point photonumeric GLS.  
Subjects verbally confirmed that their glabellar lines had an important psychological impact (on mood, 
anxiety and/or depressive symptoms).

Exclusion criteria included previous treatment with any botulinum toxin in the last 6 months; planned 
treatment with any botulinum toxin in any other body region during the study; participation in any other 
interventional clinical study within 30 days; other previous permanent or planned facia aesthetic 
procedures; and local or systemic conditions likely to increase risks of the procedure.  
Treatments 
A single treatment (0.1 mL im into each of 5 sites) of DWP-450 (20 U in total, administered as 4 U/0.1 mL)

GLS comprises 2 photonumeric scales for assessing GLs at maximum frown and at rest over a 
4-point scale of 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe. The GLS was validated using 4 
physicians assessing photographs of subjects at rest (33) and at maximum frown (38). 
EMA/281737/2019 
Page 36/131 
 
 
  
 
 
Investigators were trained and certified when achieving >80% in a grading test. All subjects 
received onsite training and a training manual for reference at each visit.  
-  Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) scores by IA and SA. 
-  Subject Satisfaction Scale (SSS) by SA. 
- Hospital Activity and Depression Scale (HADS) Score 
The HADS has 14 questions each on a 0-3 scale, with 7 questions assessing each of anxiety and 
depression to generate HADS-Anxiety, HADS-Depression subscales where 0–7 = normal, 8–10 = 
mild, 11–14 = moderate, 15–21 = severe (Zigmond and Snaith 1983).  
Sample size 
The sample size of 540 subjects was designed for a power of 80% with a one-sided type 1 error of 2.5% 
to demonstrate a non-inferiority margin of 0.10 for DWP-450 versus Botox in the proportion of responders 
at day 30, assuming a response rate of 0.85 for DWP-450, 0.85 Botox, O.15 Placebo, AND superiority of 
DWP-450 versus Placebo, Botox versus Placebo with a two-sided type I error rate of 2.5% for each of the 
superiority tests. The initial total sample size of 497 subjects including 45 placebo subjects was increased 
to 540 subjects to allow for 10% missing data at day 30 - day 30 assessments missed or assessed outside 
the +3day permitted window. 
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomised 5:5:1 ratio to receive DWP-450, BOTOX® or placebo using a blinded 
randomisation scheme where each subject is assigned a unique subject study number using an 
Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) to provide the study site with a randomisation number.  A 
block randomisation scheme was prepared by the CRO.  Random numbers were generated in SAS using 
PROC PLAN. Randomisation was implemented through an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS). No 
stratification was applied in the block randomisation. 
Blinding (masking) 
Allocation is randomised and administration of the DWP-450, active comparator and placebo will be 
double-blinded.

Statistical methods 
Efficacy Analysis Sets 
Study populations were defined as: 
ITT – all subjects randomised to treatment.  
PPP – all randomised subjects who received the protocol required single treatment of 5 injections of the 
correct drug by randomisation and had the primary outcome measure assessed at both baseline Day 0 
and Day 30 +3 days. 
Safety Population 
-  All subjects who were randomised and received treatment. 
Statistical tests 
Efficacy data were summarised by: number and proportion of subjects in each group with exact 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs); and, the difference in the proportions between groups with the 2-sided 95% 
level CI. Efficacy analyses were performed using the PP and ITT Populations. 
Using the Per Protocol population, the tests of superiority for DWP-450 versus placebo and for BOTOX® 
versus placebo will be performed using unconditional exact test by inversion of two one-sided tests using 
standardised statistics.  
Analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint 
The proportion of subjects with a GLS score of 0 or 1 at maximum frown on Day 30 by IA will be tested 
against the primary non-inferiority hypothesis that the proportion of responders in the DWP-450 PP group 
is no more than 0.10 lower than that in the BOTOX® group.  A two-sided 95% Wald asymptotic 
confidence interval for risk difference between the proportion of responders in each group (DWP-450 and 
Botox) will be provided . Non-inferiority of DWP-450 compared to BOTOX® was concluded if the lower 
bound of the 95% confidence interval of the difference in proportions is greater than -0.10. The ITT 
population will be used to confirm the stability of the conclusion, and missing Day 30 data imputed using 
a tipping point analysis. No adjustments for covariates were factored in any of the analyses. There was no 
stratification for study centre, prior exposure to botulinum toxin, nor ADA status.  
Tests of superiority for DWP-450 versus Placebo and for BOTOX versus Placebo for the primary endpoint 
were performed using the unconditional exact test, by inversion of two one-sided tests using standardized 
statistics. A p-value <0.025 was required for each test to conclude that DWP-450 and BOTOX were each 
superior to Placebo.   
Superiority of DWP-450 over BOTOX was to be tested last using the same 95% two-sided CI (lower bound 
of 95% two-sided CI was equal to the lower bound of 97.5% one-sided CI) employed for testing 
non-inferiority. If the lower bound was above zero, DWP-450 was demonstrated as superior to BOTOX.  
The primary efficacy endpoint will also be analysed by age group (≥65 vs. <65).  
Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
Secondary efficacy endpoints were tested, for all subjects in the ITT Population with non-missing 
assessments at the respective visits, in a closed sequential process using gatekeeping methods to 
maintain the overall study Type 1 error rate of 0.05 – i.e., each endpoint was only tested if the p-value for 
the previous test was <0.05: 
EMA/281737/2019 
Page 38/131 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• In the case of secondary endpoints based on the GLS and SSS, the differences between groups in the 
proportions of responders were tested using the same exact test as the primary analysis; sequential 
testing was limited to testing the superiority of DWP-450 versus Placebo. 
• In the case of secondary endpoints based on the HADS, the Day 90 HADS scores were compared to 
baseline scores within each group using the paired t-test; sequential testing was limited to testing the 
improvement of HADS scores from baseline to Day 90 for the DWP-450 group. Sequential testing of 
secondary efficacy endpoints for HADS scores was based on the mean changes in HADS-A and HADS-D 
scores from baseline to Day 90 for all DWP-450 subjects, not on comparisons with Placebo. P-Value was 
based on paired t-test. 
For the comparison of DWP-450 versus Placebo, the exact confidence interval and associated test were 
based unconditional exact test by inversion of two-one sided tests. For DWP-450 vs Placebo and BOTOX 
vs Placebo, the 95% confidence interval for the mean was calculated based on two-independent t-test. 
Sensitivity analyses 
Missing Day 30 primary efficacy outcome data were imputed using a tipping point.  This analysis consisted 
of determining if, for subjects with a missing Day 30 primary outcome, there was a combination of 
assigning a failure to those in the DWP-450 group and a success to those in the Placebo group, which 
resulted in a non-statistically significant test of the null hypothesis. Using the general concepts outlined 
by Yan et al. (2009), the additional number of responders required in the Placebo group compared to the 
DWP-450 group among subjects with missing data was determined to achieve a p-value of ≥0.025.  
Subgroup analyses 
No test for homogeneity of treatment effects across study sites was otherwise performed, and no 
analyses were performed that controlled for differences by study site. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was analysed by age groups of <65 years and ≥65 years. PP population was 
used.

The absolute differences between BOTOX and Placebo, DWP-450 and Placebo, were 78.6% and 83.1%, 
respectively (both p<0.001). The absolute difference between DWP-450 and BOTOX in percentages of 
responders was 4.4% (95% CI -1.9, 10.8), consistent with non-inferiority given that the lower bound of 
the 95% CI interval was greater than -10.0%, and similarly for ITT. The impact of missing primary 
endpoint data was minimal. 
Less than 10% were >65 years of age; % responders for the primary efficacy endpoint after Placebo, 
BOTOX and DWP-450 were greater in the 489 PP subjects <65 years vs 38 PP subjects >65 years old at 
4.5%, 84.1%, 87.7% versus 0.0%, 66.7% and 81.3%, respectively.  
The proportion of responders to Botox, DWP-450 varied between sites from 7/13 (54%) to 11/11 (100%), 
12/16 (75%) to 20/20 (100%) with a relative risk differences from -11.9 (95% -36.4, 13.0) to 20.0 (-4.8,

Assessment Methods  
- Glabellar Line Scale (GLS) score  
- Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) 
- Subject Satisfaction Scale (SSS) 
- Anti-Botulinum toxin A Antibodies (ADA) 
ADA was determined using a 2-tiered approach of screening then confirmation using a bridging ELISA. 
Botulinum toxin A immobilised on the assay plate is linked by ADA or positive control Ab to biotinylated 
botulinum toxin A, with the immune complex detected by the action on substrate of Streptavidin 
conjugated horseradish peroxidase. Confirmation of ADA was dependent on neutralisation of the signal by 
pre-incubation of botulinum toxin A with test serum or positive control. 
Confirmed positive ADA were tested for neutralisation of toxicity in a mouse LD50 toxicity assay using 
botulinum toxin A. 
• 
Sample size 
Sample size was determined based on safety considerations. A sample size of 324 subjects randomised 
3:1 to DWP-450:Placebo with  10% dropout rate would yield 219:73 subjects. If no adverse events were 
observed after a single treatment with DWP-450, upper bound of 95% CI =0.016, the likely true incidence 
is <1.6%.  
• 
Randomisation 
Subjects were block randomised without stratification in fours, 3:1 to DWP-450:placebo  
• 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was double-blinded including provision of the loaded syringe to the investigator

• 
Statistical methods 
Study populations were defined as: 
ITT – all subjects randomised to treatment.  
mITT – all randomised subjects who had a moderate or severe GLS score at rest on Day O by IA & SA. 
Safety population – all randomised subjects who received at least one injection of DWP-450 or placebo. 
PPP – all randomised subjects who received the protocol required single treatment of 5 injections of the 
correct drug by randomisation and had the primary outcome measure assessed at both baseline Day 0 
and Day 30 +7 days. 
The primary endpoint was assessed in a superiority design with alpha 0.05 using the stratified CMH test, 
stratified by investigator site, testing the primary null hypothesis that there was no difference in rates of 
responders between DWP-450 and placebo.  The hypothesis was tested using the exact unconditional 
test, with its exact confidence interval (CI) calculated by inversion of two one-sided intervals. The overall 
study wide Type 1 error rate (alpha) was 0.05. 
Sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint were performed to assess the impact of missing 
data. These included 3 scenarios: a worst case scenario in which missing data in the DWP-450 arm were 
treated as “non responders” and missing data in the Placebo arm were treated as “responders”; a best 
case scenario in which missing data in the DWP-450 arm were treated as “responders” and missing data 
in the Placebo arm were treated as “non responders”; and, using Days 14 and 90 data. The principal 
sensitivity analysis for the primary outcome was a tipping point analysis.  
Additional sensitivity analyses were performed using each of the per protocol (PP) and the modified ITT 
(mITT) Populations. The mITT population was defined as all randomised subjects who had moderate or 
severe GLS score at rest on Day 0, as assessed by both the investigator and subject.  
The secondary endpoints were tested sequentially using gatekeeper methods to maintain the overall 
study Type 1 error rate of 0.05 – i.e., each endpoint was only tested if the p-value for the previous exact 
test was <0.05.

Conduct of the study 
The study was conducted according to the ethical principles established in the Declaration of Helsinki and 
ICH GCP. All subjects were recruited under the revised protocol incorporating changes recommended by 
the FDA, EV-001 protocol amendment 1, Oct 27th 2014. The revised statistical analysis plan 3.3 23 Feb 
2016, prior to breaking the blinding, allowed assessment of the primary endpoint without the restriction 
of +3 days for the day 30 timepoint. The CMH test was rendered inappropriate with the small number of 
placebo subjects noting a >2point improvement, prompting the post hoc change to analysis by exact 
unconditional test with exact confidence intervals by inversion of two one sided intervals. 
A study vial was selected out of sequential order at 4 sites affecting 18 subjects, 6 Placebo & 12 DWP-450; 
the influence of this error was assessed in the sensitivity analysis.

Study EV001: Skin Type, Previous Treatment, IA/SA of GL at Maximum Frown and at Rest by ITT 
Treatment groups were well matched for age (mean age 50 years, ~11% >65 years, sex (7% male), race 
(81% White) and Fitzpatrick skin type (72% type I or II), whilst 40.6% were previous recipients of 
botulinum toxin treatment. Some 42% of women were potentially able to bear children.   
Investigator assessment noted 32% had moderate GLs at maximum frown, whilst 45% had mild or no 
GLs at rest. Subject assessment noted 22% had moderate GLS at maximum frown whilst 27% had no or 
mild GLS at rest.  
Medical History 
On direct questioning, headaches were reported in 11 (13%) and 25 (10%) of subjects in the placebo and 
DWP-450 treatment groups respectively. No subjects reported problems with eyebrow/eyelid drooping or 
speaking or swallowing at baseline.

Study EV001: Responders >/=2point Improvement in GLS at Maximum Frown by IA & SA on Day 30 vs 
Day 0, ITT by Age 
Responders were more common in subjects <65 years than those >65 years. 
Sensitivity analysis 
The absolute difference in percent responders overall was 66.3% by ITT and for other populations was 
•  58.2% for mITT, i.e. subjects with moderate or severe GLs at rest on day 0  
•  66.9% for PP  
•  66.2% for ITT excluding 18 subjects treated out of randomised order 
•  63.5% - 67.1% depending on which data points were used for missing primary endpoint data; 7 
subjects 1 placebo, 6 DWP-450 were missing day 30 data. 
Study EV002 
A phase III, multi-centre, randomised double-blind placebo controlled, single dose trial to demonstrate 
safety and efficacy of DWP-450 in adults for treatment of moderate-to-severe glabellar lines. 
Methods: 
The study design, study participants, treatments, objectives, outcomes/endpoints, assessment methods, 
sample size, randomisation, blinding (masking) and statistical methods were the same as for study 
EV001.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Analysis of Pooled Data from Randomised Placebo Controlled Trials EV001, EV002, EVB003 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria were essentially the same in these healthy volunteer, single dose 
studies, except for EVB003 which asked subjects to confirm the GLs had a significant psychological impact 
and specified additional exclusion criteria regarding local or systemic conditions precluding trial entry. 
Inclusion of EVB003 in pooled analyses of efficacy was therefore not supported.

Studies EV001, EV002: >/=2Point improvement in GLS at Maximum Frown, Day 0 to Day 30 by ITT 
There is a 5% - 10% discordance between investigator and subject assessment at maximum frown.

Clinical studies in special populations 
There were no specific studies in special populations. 
Less than 10% of subjects in EVB003 were >65 years old. 
Supportive studies 
Methods 
EV004, EV006 were two open-label multi-dose, multi-centre (11, 18), US, studies which investigated the 
safety of DFWP-450 in adults for the treatment of moderate-to-severe glabellar lines. Subjects were 
screened and assessed then treated on day 0 with 20U DWO-450 as 5x4U/0.1ml im injections as per 
studies EV001, EV002, EVB003. Subjects were followed in the office on Days 3, 7, 14, 30. On day 90 
subjects were assessed as eligible for repeat treatment if their GLS score was ≥2 at maximum frown by IA 
else followed monthly until eligible for repeat treatment, or until the study ended on Day 365. After 
retreatment, follow-up was at the same intervals with day 3, 14 reviews by telephone call. Subjects could 
receive a maximum of 4 treatments, no treatment allowed after Day 330. Inclusion criteria were like the 
EV001, EV002 with no assessment of psychological impact. Exclusion criteria included previous treatment 
with botulinum toxin of any serotype in the forehead area within the last 8 months. 
Exploratory objectives were to evaluate the efficacy of DWP-450 to reduce the severity of moderate to 
severe glabellar lines by IA at maximum frown and at rest by GLS score; SA of aesthetic improvement on 
the GAIS and SA using the SSS. 
Study period was 1 year. First enrolled 15th Sept 2014, last patient completed 23 Nov 2015 in EV004; first 
patient enrolled 7th May 2015, last patient completed 25th Aug 2016 in study EV006.  
Blood samples for immunogenicity assessment were collected prior to and at days 30, 90 of each 
treatment; and at study end or early termination.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The proposed therapeutic indication for DWP-450 is ‘When the severity of the following facial lines has an 
important psychological impact in adult patients, Nuceiva is indicated for the temporary improvement in 
the appearance of moderate to severe vertical lines between the eyebrows seen at maximum frown 
(glabellar lines)'. In this regard, a single pivotal European and Canadian multi-centre study recruited 540 
EMA/281737/2019 
Page 79/131 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
subjects with moderate or severe glabellar lines (GLs) at maximum frown for a randomised single 
treatment trial of DWP-450 versus Botox versus Placebo. In addition, two confirmatory US 
placebo-controlled studies recruited 330 and 324 subjects with moderate or severe GLs at maximum 
frown for a randomised single treatment trial of DWP-450, without assessing psychological impact. 
Additional supportive information is available from two US open label repeat treatment studies of 
DWP-450 recruiting 352 and 570 subjects with moderate or severe GLs at maximum frown, again without 
assessment of psychological impact in line with the “cosmetic” use of this type of product approved in the 
US (Botox® Cosmetic). 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
In the European trial, EVB003, no upper age limit is applied, in contrast to a restriction to adults below 65 
years of age from some botulinum toxin products depending on the data submitted. The number recruited 
to the European trial was consistent with the revised power calculations which suggested 497 subjects, 
increased during study monitoring to 540 subjects to allow for 10% missing data at day 30, would provide 
80% power to demonstrate the non-inferiority of DWP-450 versus Botox using a responder rate of 0.85, 
a non-inferiority margin of 0.10, and a one-sided Type I error rate of 2.5%. A block randomisation 
schedule was used by centre to allocate subjects in a 5:5:1 ratio to receive DWP-450, BOTOX® or 
placebo, without stratification by centre, in a double-blinded design. Prior history of botulinum toxin 
treatment was not collected but this potential source of bias should be taken care of by the process of 
randomisation. 
In contrast, the numbers recruited to the single treatment US studies, EV001, EV002, were based on 
safety considerations, and subjects randomised 3:1 to DWP-450 or Placebo in a double- blinded design. 
The numbers recruited to the repeat treatment open label US studies, EV004, EV006, were also based on 
safety considerations.  
Treatment dose 
No clinical dose response studies were performed to compare efficacy versus BOTOX®, sex, age >65 
years, previous exposure to botulinum toxin treatment, or poor response to previous treatment.  
The dose of DWP-450 used was matched to the number of toxin units indicated for BOTOX® Cosmetic, a 
licensed botulinum toxin type A medicinal product; comparability of pharmacology and non-clinical 
studies. Evidence of comparable clinical efficacy of DWP-450 and BOTOX® Cosmetic is claimed from 
Korean registration studies demonstrating comparable efficacy and safety in the clinical studies between 
DWP-450 and Botox over doses of 20U and 360U (lyophilised DWP-450 used; data not presented). There 
is sufficient evidence of comparable biological activity and potency of the lyophilised and vacuum dried 
formulations of DWP-450. 
A single treatment dose was used. At each treatment, subjects received 5 x4U (0.1ml) of DWP-450 or 
BOTOX® injection or an equal volume of saline, given as i.m. injections into standard sites of each 
corrugator muscle and the midline of the procerus muscle.  
Single treatment efficacy studies  
The placebo-controlled efficacy trials are single treatment only. The three-arm design of EVB003 is the 
recommended design for demonstrating non-inferiority, allowing for direct proof of efficacy of the new 
treatment by comparison to Placebo and some within-trial validation of the choice of non-inferiority 
margin. No active treatment extension was performed.  
DWP-450 generates temporary changes requiring repeated treatments 3 – 4 times each year in >80% of 
subjects to maintain the clinical effect. Accepting the limitations of open label studies EV004 and EV006, 
up to 50% of subjects received 4 administrations of DWP-450 over 1 year to maintain a GLS score <2 at 
EMA/281737/2019 
Page 80/131 
 
 
  
 
 
maximum frown. The interval between treatments decreased as the number of treatments increased, 
with the time to 2nd and 3rd treatments falling from 202 to 91 days and 139.5 to 91 days respectively in 
study EV004.  
Additional analyses provided demonstrate a consistent trend of shorter duration of responses and hence 
shorter treatment intervals for subjects in the 4 versus 3 versus 2 treatment cohorts, with a similar trend 
by age, gender, and in subjects with / without treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) or drug 
related TEAEs. There is a consistent trend within each treatment cohort of a small increase in interval 
between subsequent treatments. Some 25% of subjects with 3 or 4 treatments had increased gap time 
between the duration of response and interval to treatment for reasons which are unclear.   
Subjects recruited 
The subjects recruited were similar in each study, predominantly white females, and 50% of women were 
potentially able to have children in the European study. The mean age was 49 years with 17 (6.9%) 
subjects >65 years old receiving DWP-450 in the European study EVB003, versus 26 (10.6%) in EV001 
and 27 (11.0%) in EV002 – too few to be confident that clinical efficacy can be established in this age 
group. 
 A high proportion of subjects were recruited with no or mild GLs at rest by investigator assessment (IA) 
40.7% in EVB003, 45.4% EV001, 34.3% EV002.  
Prior treatment with botulinum toxin affects response rates and the immunogenicity 
assessment - these data were not collected in the pivotal study EVB003 but this potential source of bias 
should have been taken care of by the process of randomisation. The rate of prior treatment with 
botulinum toxin type A was 134/330 (40.6 %) in EV001, and 115/324 (35.5%) in EV002.  
Validation of Assessment tools 
The main assessment tool was a 4-point Glabellar Line Scale, GLS, score with separate photonumeric 
scales at maximum frown and at rest, pre-validated for IA, simple kappa coefficients of 0.819, 0.782 for 
intra-rate variability and Fleiss’s generalised kappa coefficient of 0.635, 0.512 respectively for inter-rater 
variability (<0.60 regarded as inadequate, >0.80 is preferred as the minimum acceptable interrater 
agreement, see McHugh 2012). Investigators were trained and certified when achieving >80% in a 
grading test, but inter-rater variability was not tested “in the field”. GLS scoring was not validated for SA 
although subjects were provided with onsite training, and a training manual at each visit.  
The unvalidated Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) by IA, SA and Subject Satisfaction Scale 
(SSS) scores deployed were not unique to these studies. Neither the GAIS or the SSS are validated 
patient-related outcomes (PROs) yet a range of generic validated PROs have been applied for the 
assessment of aesthetic procedures including the generic tool Freiburg Life Quality Assessment, core 
version FLQA-c (Sommer 2003) and condition specific PROs such as the Freiburg questionnaire on 
aesthetic dermatology and cosmetic surgery FQAD (Sommer 2003), Satisfaction with Facial Appearance 
scale FACE-Q (Panchapakesan 2013, Pusic 2013) and the Facial Line Outcomes Questionnaire FLO-11 
(Yaworsky 2014).   
Psychological impact was assessed in the pivotal European study only, which had an entry criterion 
requiring subjects to confirm verbally that the glabellar lines have a significant psychological impact (on 
mood, anxiety and/or depressive symptoms). Evidence of the psychological impact of treatment was 
assessed using HADS-Anxiety, HADS-Depression scores for subjects at study entry, day 30 and day 90, 
looking for evidence of variation within the “normal range”, together with the claim by the Applicant that 
no minimally important clinical difference could be defined.   
EMA/281737/2019 
Page 81/131 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Blinding and Centralised Assessment 
Botulinum toxin type A treatment has a pronounced effect risking unblinding in subjects who have 
previously received treatment. There is no independent centralised assessment of the primary endpoints, 
which might also have improved inter-rater variability, and the applicant regards the photographic 
images collected inadequate for retrospective cross validation.  Randomisation patterns are unbalanced in 
favour of test treatment at 3:1 for EV001 & EV002 and 10 (DWP-450 or Botox):1 in EVB003. These factors 
each contribute to the significant risk of unblinding of study treatment and the consequential risk of 
biased outcome assessments. These concerns are mitigated in the pivotal EVB003 study by the inclusion 
of an active treatment control and the safeguards of randomisation. 
Immunogenicity Assessment 
No immunogenicity assessment was carried out in the pivotal European study although it was included in 
each of the other studies. Minimal validation data are provided for the screening and confirmatory 
bridging ELISAs for ADAs.  The Applicant suggests false positive tests may arise with anti-tetanus Abs but 
regards this as insignificant although a false positive pre-treatment would prevent the detection of 
seroconversion after DWP-450. 
The screening assay for ADA has poor sensitivity at 3 μg/mL using the CF for NHS (1.048) and is not 
defined for the assay with the pre-dose patient serum CF (1.204). Assay thresholds were statistically 
defined for the screening assay, 5% false positives, but statistical analysis to establish the threshold for 
the confirmatory assay is not described. Neither a more sensitive ELISA nor optimisation of sensitivity is 
undertaken in contrast to earlier reports (Dressler 2014, An ELISA for detection of or detection of 
botulinum toxin Abs). Neither linearity of testing nor titering of confirmed ADA positives is described in 
any of the reports provided.  
No validation data are provided for the determination of neutralising Abs (Nabs) by testing the qualitative 
impact on botulinum toxin in the mouse LD50 assay. It is noted that the selection of the LD50 assay rather 
than the mouse phrenic nerve hemi-diaphragm assay which is some 25x more sensitive is not justified 
(reviewed by Naumann 2013).  
In summary, the immunogenicity assays are insensitive, poorly validated, risk generating results for 
binding ADA and NAbs which are substantially lower than reported in the literature and are therefore 
regarded as not fit for purpose.  
Considering the impact of binding ADA and Nabs on loss of treatment efficacy, the Applicant is requested 
to perform a non-interventional immunogenicity analysis and re-test the previously negative sera from 
studies EV-001, EV-002, EV-004, EV006 using new binding ADA assays for screening, confirmation and 
determination of ADA titres, supported by a sensitive assay for neutralising ADA. This commitment is 
reflected in the RMP as an additional pharmacovigilance activity. 
Endpoints 
Different primary endpoints were chosen for EVB003 and studies EV001, EV002. The Applicant regarded 
the targeted optimal level of residual facial expression after a botulinum toxin is a GLS score of 0 (no 
wrinkles) or 1 (mild) at maximum frown since it: 
-  Best reflects the mechanism of action of botulinum toxin as it applies to the baseline physical 
characteristics of the intended patient population 
-  Reflects the wishes of that population,  
and thus, was considered the most clinically relevant GLS endpoint in the DWP-450 clinical development 
programme. This was agreed by the CHMP.   
EMA/281737/2019 
Page 82/131 
 
 
  
 
 
The primary endpoint in EVB003 was a GLS score of 0 or 1 (none or mild), at day 30 by IA by PP, which 
will include those with a 1-point improvement in GLS if they score 2 (moderate) at baseline. Despite the 
fact that in the scientific advice (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/130926/2016) noted that a 1-point change was 
considered quite a modest level of improvement, the CHMP agreed that the use of 1 point for the 
definition of the primary endpoint was acceptable.  
The EV-001, EV-002 studies used a statistically onerous, rather than clinically relevant, primary endpoint: 
a two-point composite whereby a subject is judged a responder only if both IA and SA independently and 
simultaneously agreed a two-point improvement on GLS at maximum frown on Day 30 relative to the 
baseline score.  
The US retreatment studies require a GLS score at maximum frown of <2 by IA before subjects are 
eligible for retreatment.  
A systematic appraisal of whether residual facial expression is desirable is lacking but additional analysis 
of subject’s response by baseline parameters is provided to assist doctors and their patients on the 
chances of achieving different degrees of therapeutic effect. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Subjects were reasonably balanced for baseline characteristics in each of the single dose studies across 
the treatment groups. In the pivotal European study EVB003, subjects confirmed verbally that their 
glabellar lines had an important psychological impact (on mood, anxiety and/or depressive symptoms). 
The non-inferiority margin for absolute difference for the primary endpoint, a GLS score of 0 or 1 at 
maximum frown at day 30 by IA, was 4.4 (95% CI -1.9, 10.8) for DWP-450 vs Botox, within the -10% 
non-inferiority margin; it was felt that clinically a difference of 10% would not be noticeable. Similarly, for 
subjects >65 years the non-inferiority margin was 14.6 (-14.4, 43.6) for DWP-450 (n=16) versus Botox 
(n=18).  
The number of older subjects studied is too small to address key concerns about the efficacy of botulinum 
toxin in the elderly where the pathogenesis of wrinkles (including glabellar lines) may reflect 
gravity-induced tissue sagging due to thinner, less elastic skin and weaker facial muscles rather than 
muscle contraction. Thus, additional resurfacing procedures may be necessary to achieve visible 
differences in appearance, although Botulinum toxin may help soften wrinkles that are noticeable even 
without muscle contraction (reviewed by C M Cheng 2007, Cosmetic use of botulinum toxin type A in the 
elderly, Clinical Interventions in Aging 2007:2(1) 81–83).  
Superiority of DWP-450 over Botox was not formally tested for any endpoint.  Responses are substantially 
higher than placebo irrespective of the assessment threshold applied for both DWP-450 and Botox, with 
the absolute difference from placebo depending on the assessment performed.  Assessments by subjects 
appeared supportive. Neither the Subject Satisfaction Scale (SSS) nor the Global Aesthetic Improvement 
Scale (GAIS) scores were validated, but with this caveat subjects in study EVB003 with a GLS score of 0 
or 1 vs 2 or 3 at maximum frown by IA are more likely to have SSS scores of 1 or 2 186/189 (98.4%) vs 
33/51 (64.7%) and GAIS scores of 1 or 2 at 189/190 (99.5) vs 38/51 (74.5%).  
Fitzpatrick skin types were not included in the sensitivity analysis for EVB003 and DWP-450 treated 
subjects were limited to 4 with type V (brown skin) and 1 with type VI (dark brown or black skin). 
Evidence of a significant response across skin types was presented from pooled data from EV001, EV002 
(with placebo values for EV001, EV002, EVB003) using a >2point improvement in GLS score at maximum 
frown by IA and SA at day 30 to show an absolute difference from placebo for the most common skin 
types III of 64.6 (95% CI 56.7, 71.6) and IV 63.4 (49.3, 73.9) versus type V 72.4 (29.9, 87.4), and type

VI 66.7 (2.0, 90.1). Similar pooled analysis showed treatment responses were lower in males than 
females 53.5 (35.5, 68.8) versus 69.4 (64.5, 73.8), and in subjects with no prior history of botulinum 
toxin use at 64.0 (57.7, 69.6) versus 73.3 (64.1, 79.9). 
The duration of response in the placebo-controlled trials was assessed by the maintenance of a >/=2point 
improvement in GLS score at maximum frown by IA, with a median (iqr) of 78 (68, 91) days in EVB003, 
85 (76, 113) days in EV001, and 86 (78, 113) days in EV002; with 3.5%, 6.5%, 6.5% respectively 
remaining as responders through day 150. In the open label studies EV004, EV006, the estimated median 
(iqr) duration of response in those achieving a GLS score of 0 vs 1 for baseline GLS = 2 was 80 (66 - 90) 
days vs 93 (78 - 113) days and for baseline GLS =3 was 79 (29 - 86) days vs 85 (72 - 90) days 
respectively.  
In post hoc subgroup analysis, subjects with lower baseline GLS at rest in EVB003 were more likely to 
achieve day 30 GLS score of 0 vs 1 at maximum frown by IA, at 59.2% vs 38.8% for GLS <1 at rest and 
10.9% vs 67.4% for GLS>1 at rest. Subjects in EV001 + EV002 with prior exposure to botulinum toxin are 
more likely to achieve day 30 GLS scores at maximum frown by IA of 0 vs 1 at 50.5% vs 40.4% compared 
with 47.3% vs 36.6% with no prior exposure. Subjects >65 years old or males were more likely than 
younger or females to achieve GLS = 1 vs 0 at day 30 on maximum frown by IA.    
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The proposed indication for Nuceiva is for the temporary improvement in the appearance of moderate to 
severe vertical lines between the eyebrows seen at maximum frown (glabellar lines), when the severity of 
the above facial lines has an important psychological impact in adult patients. The clinical studies 
demonstrated a clear improvement in the appearance of glabellar lines which was non-inferior to the 
improvement observed with active comparator. 
For the claimed indication, evidence that the study population had psychological impact was dependent 
on a subject’s simple verbal response at baseline was confirmed. This is in line with clinical practice where 
practitioners consult with patients and assess the psychological impact of the glabellar lines prior to 
administering botulinum toxin A, to ensure it is an appropriate treatment for their patient.  
Patients were also assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale, which is not validated for 
this specific patient population. Most patients were in the normal range of this scale at baseline and both 
Nuceiva and the active comparator Botox used in the study did not demonstrate a beneficial effect as 
compared to placebo on this scale. In a subset of patients who had higher Hospital Anxiety and 
Depression scores at baseline demonstrated beneficial effects following treatment compared to placebo. 
Whilst the treatment had no beneficial effect on psychological impact given that the change in HADS 
scores was overall no different from placebo, the results on other patient-related outcome scales (Subject 
Satisfaction Score (SSS) and Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS)) demonstrated significant 
benefit from treatment with Nuceiva. 
Although the use of validated PROs would have been preferred, the CHMP was satisfied that the 
psychological wellbeing improvement for the treated patients was sufficiently demonstrated as similar to 
the active comparator Botox and it is therefore acceptable in relation to the agreed indication. 
Despite several minor other concerns since the pivotal study EVB003 lacks an active controlled extension 
to assess clinical efficacy of multiple doses typical of clinical practice and relies on unvalidated PROs to 
claim high rates of subject satisfaction based on the GAIS score by SA and the SSS, instead of a selection 
from a range of validated PROs, the CHMP agrees that the data provided to support efficacy of the product 
were considered sufficient. 
EMA/281737/2019

Data on previous exposure to botulinum toxin is not collected, relying on randomisation to balance this 
important variable. The two-fold variation in treatment response rates between study sites, with a range 
of risk difference between Botox and DWO-450 of -11.9% to 20.0% points, is potentially attributable to 
random variation and inter-rater variability of IA.  
The efficacy data from the single dose RCTs EV001, EV002 are influenced by a strong treatment effect, 
the lack of independent centralised assessment, and unbalanced randomisation, in the context of high 
rates of previous exposure. These factors each contribute to the significant risk of unblinding of study 
treatment and the consequential risk of biased outcome assessments. These concerns being mitigated in 
the pivotal EVB003 study by the inclusion of an active treatment control and the safeguards of 
randomisation, the RCTs EV001 and EV002 are therefore considered as supportive studies only. 
The open label studies EV004, EV006 are not designed to collect efficacy data and factors affecting 
subject dropout versus progression to retreatment are poorly characterised. Additional analyses 
demonstrate a consistent trend of shorter duration of responses and hence shorter treatment intervals for 
subjects in the 4 versus 3 versus 2 treatment cohorts, with a similar trend by age, gender, and in subjects 
with / without TEAEs or drug related TEAEs. There is a consistent trend within each treatment cohort of a 
small increase in interval between subsequent treatments. Some 25% of subjects with 3 or 4 treatments 
had increased gap time between the duration of response and interval to treatment for reasons which are 
unclear.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
- Non-interventional immunogenicity analysis, with re-test of previously negative sera from studies 
EV-001, EV-002, EV-004, EV006 using new binding ADA assays for screening, confirmation and 
determination of ADA titres, supported by a sensitive assay for neutralising ADA. This commitment is 
reflected in the RMP as an additional pharmacovigilance activity. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Study EV001 and Study EV002 
Each subject, EV001 = 246, EV002 = 246, randomised to DWP-450 received 5x4U DWP-450 i.e. 20U in 
0.5ml saline im, with Placebo subjects, n = 84 and 78 respectively, receiving the same volumes as saline.  
Study EVB003 
Each subject randomised to DWP-450, n=245, received 5x4U DWP-450 i.e. 20U in 0.5ml saline im, to 
Botox, n=246, received 5x4U Botox 20U in 0.5ml saline im similarly, with Placebo subjects, n = 49 
receiving the same volumes as saline.  
Study EV004 
The median dose administered was 60 units of DWP-450, and 262/353 (74.5%) of subjects received 3 or 
4 treatments. N.B. The effective dose of toxin received by patients in this study was standardised using 
the LD50 assay, although the amount of botulinum toxin protein differed since the lyophilised product 
used contained 50% overage of toxin versus the 5% overage of toxin in the vacuum dried product used 
in the each of the other clinical studies.

Study EV004: Extent of Exposure 
Study EV006 
The median dose administered was 60 units of DWP-450, and 431/570 (75.6%) of subjects received 3 or 
4 treatments. 
Study EV006: Extent of Exposure 
The interval between the initial treatment and first retreatment declined as the number of treatments 
given increased from 2 – 4, in both studies EV004, EV006.

Term 
Eye disorders were the main adverse event of special interest affecting 27/1659 (1.6%) of subjects 
including 17 with eyelid ptosis (complicated by blurred vision or diplopia in 3); 5 subjects had brow ptosis, 
3 had blepharospasm, 1 had intermittent twitching of the left eye, 1 had blurred vision alone. 
Two subjects had speech disorder: 
- a subject reported seeming tongue tied and stumbled over words the evening after the 1st retreatment, 
resolving after a couple of hours; no further treatment was given. 
 - a subject reported mild intermittent difficulty speaking multiple syllable words with onset 4 days after 
the IT visit, resolving the same day

Summary of Adverse Events of Special Interest Investigator Assessed as Unrelated to Study Drug 
Eye disorders 
Attribution of events of special interest is difficult and it is not possible to completely exclude the 
involvement of study drug in local events including eyelid ptosis in 7 subjects (1 with blurred vision) and 
2 with blepharospasm.  
Two other eye disorders might be indicative of a change in muscle strength after DWP-450:  
- a subject with moderate sudden strabismus 14 days after DWP-450 lasting approximately 10 minutes.  
- a patient had presbyopia on day 5 which responded to a change in prescription for lenses and further 
treatment was given without problems.  
The 27 cases investigator assessed as related to study drug together with 11 similar cases of eye 
disorders investigator assessed as not related to study drug suggest a total rate for adverse events of 
special interest: eye disorders of 38/1659 (2.3%). 
(Distant) Events of Special Interest Investigator Assessed as not due to the study drug 
Key details from the case records are provided for the following events of special interest investigator 
assessed as not due to the study drug.

One patient had dyspnoea resolving after 2 hours on day 6, concurrent with gastroenteritis.  
A patient had multiple symptoms including eye drooping, vision loss and weakness of lateral gaze on left 
side, mild in severity 13 days after treatment, was seen by his GP, attended the Emergency Department 
later that evening where a CT scan prompted admission which was declined. The episode was updated as 
a transient ischemic attack (TIA), the Investigator assessed the event as not related to study treatment 
later indirect follow up recorded the adverse event as not recovered/not resolved. The subject declined to 
provide his medical records. 
A patient with mild-to moderate mitral valve regurgitation reported mild shortness of breath on day 125 
reported as resolving at EOS. 
A patient had dysphagia from day 144 which was resolving at EOS 2 days later 
A patient had dysphonia onset day 25 which had resolved by day 42 
A patient had dyspnoea after smoke inhalation on day 112, further treatment given without problems 
A patient reported mild dyspnoea on day 2 resolving within 2 days 
A patient reported mild dysphagia on day 3 after retreatment 1, resolving within 10 minutes, and two 
further treatments were given without problems 
A patient reported difficulty in swallowing on two separate occasions 4 days after re-treatment 3 which 
resolved by day 8.  
The case reports give no reasonable cause for concern that any of these (distant) events of special 
interest were attributable to the study drug.  
Cardiac events of Special Interest Investigator Assessed as not due to the study drug 
A patient had a sinus bradycardia, HR 58 bpm day 25 after treatment, considered resolved at EOS when 
HR 60 bpm, having received 2 retreatments without problems 
A patient had a sinus bradycardia, HR 56 bpm day 36 after treatment versus baseline 68 bpm, with no 
additional follow-up available 
A patient had a bradycardia at the radial pulse, HR 57 bpm day 7 after treatment although 12 lead ECGs 
were normal at baseline, on day 7 and at EOS having received 2 retreatments without problems 
A patient had a sinus bradycardia HR 59 bpm 106 days (EOS) after retreatment 2, versus 60 bpm on 12 
lead ECG at baseline, and 61 bpm on day 30 IT ECG. 
The case reports give no reasonable cause for concern that any of these cardiac events were attributable 
to the study drug.  
Cardiovascular Safety Report 
Review of the centrally reported ECG findings for studies EV001, EV002, EV004, EV006 revealed minimal 
notable interval findings for prolonged or short PR, however higher changes in QT interval were seen in 
some incidences QTcB – Bazett’s Correction ≥30 msec with DWP-450 versus placebo. One patient had a > 
60 m sec increase.  Subject #205026 had a QTcB value of 517 (i.e., >500 msec) at EOS but using the 
recommended Friderica fixed exponent correction method whilst the QTc was >480msec and increased 
by >60msec over baseline on day 30 it returned to normal by EOS day 150.  
The risk of prolongation of the QTc was therefore low at 1/1333 (<0.1%), transient, and without a 
mechanistic basis. 
EMA/281737/2019 
Page 98/131 
 
 
  
 
 
 
In addition, diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate and respiratory rate appeared to be higher following DWP 
450 compared with placebo. It is unclear whether any patients were symptomatic, whether any persistent 
changes (i.e. following EOS) were clinically relevant and related to study drug. 
In Study EV-002, one subject who was randomized to treatment with DWP-450 and treated on February 
26, 2015. On March 11, 2015 (13 days after treatment) he experienced multiple symptoms including eye 
drooping, vision loss and weakness of lateral gaze on left side, mild in severity. The event was classified 
as a transient ischemic attack (TIA) even though the event was reported as not resolved /not recovered 
5 months after the initial event. The subject was terminated from the study at this point. The subject had 
no relevant risk factors in his past medical history. Case details are unclear including why it was not 
considered causally related to DWP 450.  
Laboratory findings 
There are no relevant laboratory safety issues to report.

Summary: Pooled Analysis of TEAEs by Age, Sex, Race 
TEAEs are more common in older subjects for each pooled analysis, overall 40.9% vs 38.1%. 
TEAEs are more common in females than males for all the US studies, particularly after multiple doses 
43.3% vs 23.5% and overall 39.3% versus 29.1%. 
Potential differences between racial groups in rates of TEAEs are not assessable because of the small 
number of non-white subjects.

Safety in special populations: Pregnancy 
Summary of Subjects with a Pregnancy During the Study 
Each subject had a negative pregnancy test at study entry. 
All except one subject delivered healthy infants.  
A subject  had a spontaneous abortion 114 days after study treatment, which was not regarded as 
attributable to the study drug.  
No further treatment was given, and all were withdrawn from the study except two subjects. 
Immunological events 
Study EV001: Anti-Botulinum toxin A Abs (Confirmed positive) 
Botulinum toxin type A Ab testing (ADA) was performed on 1294 samples of which 4 were positive, all 
from a subject with previous exposure, lastly in 2013 with a forehead injection, treated with DWP-450 on 
20/02/2015 when the GLS score at maximum frown was 3 (severe) by IA. There was no response to 
treatment. 
Study EV002: Anti-Botulinum toxin A Abs (Confirmed positive) 
Botulinum toxin type A Ab testing was performed on 1258 samples of which none were positive. 
Study EVB003: Anti-Botulinum toxin A Abs (Confirmed positive) 
No Botulinum toxin type A Ab testing reported in study EVB003. 
Study EV004: Summary of Anti-Botulinum toxin A Antibody testing over Time 
One of two positive ADA subjects was a non-responder – prior history of botulinum toxin exposure 
unknown. 
In study EV004 2393 unique samples were received and tested. Specifically, 426 visits were duplicated 
when a subject who qualified for a repeat treatment at a Day 90 visit had data for both a Day 90 and a 
Repeat Treatment Day 0 at the same office visit entered by the study site, which resulted in the inflated 
subtotal of 2819 negative sera. 
Study EV006 
Botulinum toxin type A Ab testing was performed on 4060 sera of which one sample from one subject was 
positive at baseline at 1 in 50, whilst 5 subsequent samples tested negative, was a treatment responder.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The active controlled single dose study EVB003, the single dose placebo-controlled studies EV001, 
EV002; and the open label studies EV004, EV006 with <3 repeat treatments over 1 year each contribute 
to the safety assessment. The exposure of some 1800 subjects to one or more doses of DWP-450 in the 
five clinical trials reported here should enable ADRs with a frequency of at least <0.01% - 0.1% to be 
detected if there was no background incidence.  
Exposure 
Each subject in studies EV001, EV002, EVB003 received a single administration of 20 units of DWP-450. 
No long-term extension of study EVB003 was performed. 
The effective dose of toxin received by patients in study EV004 was standardised using the LD50 assay, 
although subjects received significantly higher amounts of botulinum toxin protein since the lyophilised 
product used contained 50% overage of toxin versus the 5% overage of toxin in the vacuum dried product 
used in the each of the other clinical studies.  
Otherwise in studies EV004 and EV006, the median dose administered was 60 units of DWP-450 where 
262/353 (74.5%) and 431/570 (75.6%) of subjects respectively received 3 or 4 treatments. As the 
number of treatments given increased from 2 – 4 the interval between the initial treatment and first 
retreatment declined, with a median interval of 202, 123, 91 days and 190, 125, 91 days respectively.

Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) 
In EVB003, TEAEs were more common than placebo for DWP-450 and Botox for subjects with >1 TEAEs 
at 32.7%, 37.6% & 41.9% (incidence difference DWP-450 versus Botox -4.3 (-13.3, 4.4)) and >1 Drug 
related TEAEs at 4.1%, 15.4% & 14.6%, respectively. TEAEs occurred at similar rates after Botox and 
DW-450 in study EVB003 and were in the same range in studies EV001, EV002. The most common TEAE 
was headache for placebo, Botox, and DWP-450 at 14.3%, 10.2%, 13.9% respectively. No long-term 
extension of study EVB003 was performed. 
The rate of subjects with >1 Treatment Emergent Serious AEs after <4 treatments at 1% - 2% is like the 
rate after a single treatment.  The most frequent TEAE is headache at 13% - 15%, a similar rate to the 
placebo controlled single dose studies. 
Some 4 – 5% of subjects had administration site TEAEs.  
No serious adverse events were regarded as related to the study drug, including a single death due to an 
unrelated drug overdose. The overall rate of TEAEs leading to study discontinuation is low at <0.5% and 
none attributable to the study drug. 
TEAEs of Special Interest 
Six (6/1659, 0.4%) of subjects had hypersensitivity reactions including eyelid oedema, injection site 
pruritus, and influenza like illness, assessed as related to study drug. 
The 27 cases with eye disorders investigator assessed as related to study drug together with 11 similar 
cases of eye disorders investigator assessed as not related to study drug suggest a total rate for adverse 
events of special interest: eye disorders of 38/1659 (2.3%). 
Two (2/1659 0.1%) of subjects, study EV004, had short-lived dysarthria investigator assessed as 
related to the study drug. Case reports give no reasonable cause for concern that any of the other 
(distant) events of special interest, including cardiac events, were attributable to the study drug. The risk 
of prolongation of the QTc was low at 1/1333 (<0.1%), transient, not seen after repeat administration 
and without a mechanistic basis.  
Muscle volume loss 
The expectation that muscle volume loss will occur after botulinum toxin treatment has been addressed 
in the Product Information.  
TEAEs after Multiple versus Single Administration of DWP-450 
No direct comparison between multiple vs single administration of DWP-450 is available in the absence of 
an active controlled extension of the pivotal study EVB003. Whilst collecting safety data in an open label 
design is acceptable, the issue is the extent to which the population in the single arm open label study is 
representative of the population studied in the pivotal study. Data from the open label studies relating to 
repeated dosing may not be sufficiently robust given the concern about bias both in assessment and 
patient selection. This risk is evident from the unexplained difference in TEAEs after the first dose, where 
TEAEs and study drug related TEAEs after the initial treatment were substantially lower in the multiple 
dose open label studies (EV004, EV006) versus the single dose randomised clinical trials. Considering 
each treatment dose, The rate of TEAEs, study drug related TEAEs, TEAEs of special interest, and study 
drug related TEAEs of special interest are lower at subsequent treatment intervals in the open label 
studies EV004, EV006 for subjects who undergo retreatment, but the factors influencing the decision to 
undergo retreatment are unclear in these open label uncontrolled studies. 
EMA/281737/2019 
Page 105/131 
 
 
  
 
 
In pooled analysis, the overall increase in TEAEs after multiple administrations of DWP-450 (34.5% vs 
41.5%) is evident for mild, moderate, severe TEAEs (1.6% vs 2.2%); serious TEAEs (1.4% vs 1.5%) and 
TEAEs of special interest (2.7% vs 2.9%), but not study drug related TEAEs at 13.6% vs 12.1%.  
Although the trend of adverse events in study EVB-003 is consistently in favour of Botox over DWP-450, 
it is accepted that conclusions should be guarded when they are based on single placebo-controlled RCT. 
This uncertainty places further importance on a clear safety signal from the repeat dose studies. Repeated 
administration of Botulinum toxin by i.m. injection is typically performed and therefore the rate of 
frequency of TEAEs both after each administration and over the whole treatment course are relevant to 
the safety assessment. Overall, rates of TEAEs and TEAEs of special interest are increased after repeated 
versus single doses of DWP-450. Direct comparison of multiple vs single administration of DWP-450 is 
precluded by the absence of an active controlled extension of the pivotal study EVB003. Indirect 
comparison of multiple vs single administration of DWP-450 is limited on several grounds. There is a risk 
that patient characteristics and patient expectations will differ between RCTs and single arm open-label 
studies, and indeed the studies are poorly matched for Fitzpatrick skin types. The open-label studies are 
confounded by much higher rates of significant protocol deviations (up to 40% in study EV004) and 
~10fold excess of subject withdrawals compared with the single dose RCT EVB-003. Many of the subject 
withdrawals are unexplained. Data on the subjects’ previous exposure to botulinum toxin injections was 
not collected systematically. These multiple confounders significantly limit confidence these open label 
studies accurately reflect real-world experience or support the claim that the rate of adverse events per 
administration decrease with successive administrations of botulinum toxin.         
TEAEs in Special Populations and Subgroups 
Overall, TEAEs were more common in females than males, particularly after multiple doses 43.3% vs 
23.5%, and overall 39.3% versus 29.1%. In contrast, TEAEs of Special interest are more common in 
males than females in each pooled analysis, at 8/151 (5.3%) vs 39/1508 (2.6%) overall respectively. 
There was an excess of TEAEs in subjects >65 years than <65 years in some clinical studies (EV001 
53.8% vs 36.4%, EV002 33.3 vs 27.9%; EVB003 23.5% vs 38.6%; EV004 48.5% vs 41.4%, EV006 
39.2%, 41.4% respectively), and overall at 40.9% vs 38.1%. TEAEs of Special interest are more 
common in older than younger subjects overall 6/154 (3.9%) vs 41/1505 (2.7%). Too few older 
subjects were studied to address key concerns about the safety of botulinum toxin in the elderly: 
• 
Increased risk of eyelid ptosis 
EMA/281737/2019 
Page 106/131 
 
 
  
 
 
 
o  Many use the frontalis muscle to raise their eyebrows and eyelids to see 
o  May have extra skin under the brow (pseudoptosis) 
o  May have a reduced or absent orbital septum 
• 
Increased susceptibility to bruising after botulinum toxin injections  
o  Delicate skin 
o 
Interaction with prescribed or OTC medications such as anti-inflammatory agents, 
anti-coagulants, anti-platelet agents and aspirin 
These additional risks in the elderly might be mitigated by conservative dosing, low volume injections, 
electromyographic guidance to ensure proper placement of injections, and reviewing the options for 
temporary cessation of interacting medications. (See review by C M Cheng 2007, Cosmetic use of 
botulinum toxin type A in the elderly, Clinical Interventions in Aging 2007:2(1) 81–83). 
Subjects with fair skin (II) may have higher rates of TEAEs of special interest than those with light brown 
skin (IV). Potential differences between racial groups in rates of TEAEs and TEAEs of special interest are 
not assessable because of the small number of non-white subjects.  
TEAEs of Special interest rates are higher in subjects with severe versus moderate GLs at maximum frown 
by IA at baseline in each study and 7-fold higher overall, 45/1224 (3.7%) vs 2/435 (0.5%). 
Eight subjects had a pregnancy during the study despite a negative pregnancy test at study entry and 
after deploying a range of strategies to avoid becoming pregnant. Seven of eight delivered healthy infants 
whilst one subject had a spontaneous abortion assessed as unrelated to the study drug. No further 
treatment was given. 
The risk of facial asymmetry is not discussed. No drug-drug interactions were explored 
Immunogenicity 
The screening assay for Anti-Botulinum toxin A Antibodies (ADA) has poor sensitivity at 3 μg/mL using the 
CF for NHS (1.048) and is not defined for the assay with the pre-dose patient serum CF (1.204). Assay 
thresholds were statistically defined for the screening assay, 5% false positives, but statistical analysis to 
establish the threshold for the confirmatory assay is not described. Neither a more sensitive ELISA nor 
optimisation of sensitivity is undertaken in contrast to earlier reports (Dressler 2014, An ELISA for 
detection of or detection of botulinum toxin Abs). Neither linearity of testing nor titering of confirmed ADA 
positives is described in any of the reports provided. It is unclear whether the sample analysis is within the 
defined stability of samples since long term stability data are not provided. Neutralisation assays are 
typically qualitative but selection of the LD50 assay rather than the mouse diaphragm assay which is 
some 25x more sensitive is not justified. The neutralisation assay has no initial validation documented 
and the clinical conditions of use differ since the clinical report provided states “Due to the limited volume 
for the Human Serum Samples, a lower volume than previously validated was used to conduct this study”.  
The immunogenicity assessment of DWP-450 is solely dependent on studies without an active control, on 
the basis that the low rate of ADA detected renders comparative studies irrelevant, hence the absence of 
assessment within the pivotal study. Few ADA subjects are identified by the insensitive assay, whilst 
7/761 (0.9%) of screen positive samples are confirmed positive. The rate of neutralisation Abs of 1 in 
1414 (0.07%) subjects is substantially lower than reported in a systematic review and meta-analysis by 
Fabbri 2016 who cites an overall prevalence of 1.1% (95% CI 0.1% - 7.5%) for hyperhidrosis, glabellar 
line, and hypersalivation, versus 0.4% (0.1% - 0.7%) in clinically responding glabellar line patients. No 
studies are reported which examine neutralising Abs in secondary non-responder patients treated for 
EMA/281737/2019 
Page 107/131 
 
 
  
 
 
glabellar lines although in a retrospective series of secondary non-responders, Lange 2009 reports NAbs 
in 16% - 26% of patients treated with botulinum toxin for blepharospasm.   
In summary, the immunogenicity assessment is regarded as not fit for purpose since the assays are 
insensitive, poorly validated, generate results for NAbs which are substantially lower than reported in the 
literature, and provide no realistic estimation of ADA rates for DWP-450 alone or in comparison with 
Botox.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Short-term safety profile 
The type and incidence of ADRs to the test and reference products were broadly comparable and in-line 
with those expected from the Botox SmPC: Thus, for the granted  indication, the short-term safety profile 
is of concern given the increased rate of drug related TEAEs, serious TEAEs, and TEAEs of special interest 
including a 2% rate of eye disorders. The uncertainty about the rate of TEAE based on a small single 
placebo-controlled RCT is accepted. In order to further quantify the safety concerns, and in particular the 
eye disorders including eyelid ptosis, a non-interventional PASS is required (see also below, safety of 
multiple vs single administration and long-term data).  
Safety of multiple vs single administration and long-term safety data 
In the absence of an active controlled extension of the pivotal study EVB003, there is no direct 
comparison between multiple vs single administration of DWP-450. 
In addition, whilst collecting safety data in an open label design is acceptable, the issue is the extent to 
which the population in the single arm open label study is representative of the population studied in the 
pivotal study. Data from the open label studies relating to repeated dosing may not be sufficiently robust 
given the concern about bias both in assessment and patient selection. The risk that subjects recruited to 
Randomised Clinical Trials differ significantly from those recruited to open-label uncontrolled studies is 
evident from the unexplained difference in TEAEs and study drug related TEAEs after the initial treatment, 
where the rate of these TEAEs is substantially lower in the multiple dose open label studies (EV004, 
EV006) versus the single dose RCTs. Considering each treatment dose, the rate of TEAEs, study drug 
related TEAEs, TEAEs of special interest, and study drug related TEAEs of special interest are lower at 
subsequent treatment intervals in the open label studies EV004, EV006 for subjects who undergo 
retreatment, but the factors influencing the decision to undergo retreatment are unclear in these open 
label uncontrolled studies. These limited open label studies indicate increased rates of TEAEs after 
multiple administrations of DWP-450 is evident for mild, moderate, severe TEAEs; a similar trend is seen 
for serious TEAEs and TEAEs of special interest; and there is an unexplained trend in interval shortening. 
In addition to local spread of toxin effect as shown by eye disorders, there is limited evidence of distant 
effects as shown by reports of difficulties with speech, albeit short-lived. 
Whilst it was agreed that the long-term data available did not raise any major concerns, it was felt 
important to have more robust data. Therefore, in order to quantify the safety concerns, including eye 
disorders, and provide additional characterisation of the long-term safety of Nuceiva, a 
non-interventional PASS is required. The commitment to perform a non-interventional PASS is 
appropriately reflected as an additional pharmacovigilance activity in the RMP, including agreement of the 
protocol, annual study progress report and final study report submission.

Muscle volume loss 
New literature reveals muscle volume loss after single and repeat injections of botulinum toxin.  
A statement that muscle atrophy is expected after repeated of botulinum treatment is therefore included 
in the SmPC. 
Immunogenicity assessment not fit for purpose 
Overall the immunogenicity risk with botulinum toxin A administration is regarded as low but not 
insignificant. In the absence of an immunogenicity assessment within the pivotal study, there are no 
reliable comparative ADA data for DWP-450 versus Botox. Nor are there reliable immunogenicity data for 
DWP-450 per se since the assays are insensitive, poorly validated, generate low rates of binding Abs and 
NAbs which are substantially lower than reported in the literature. The clinical relevance of NAbs is 
underlined by high rates reported in secondary non-responders.   
As a post-authorisation commitment, the applicant is to re-test previously negative sera from studies 
EV-001, EV-002, EV-004, EV006 using new binding ADA assays for screening, confirmation and 
determination of ADA titres, supported by a sensitive assay for neutralising ADA (see also above, 
Conclusions on the Clinical Efficacy).  
In addition, the applicant will, when possible, ask the subjects who are non-responders to have a blood 
sample tested for NAb using the mouse hemi-diaphragm model. The neutralising antibody analysis for 
non-responders who volunteer blood samples will be reported via routine pharmacovigilance and is 
reflected in the RMP as an additional pharmacovigilance activity. 
In summary, the uncertainty about the rate of adverse events of special interest including eye disorders 
based on a single small RPCT is accepted. The open label repeat dose studies did not collect exposure 
history systematically and are subject to multiple confounders which significantly limit confidence they 
accurately reflect real-world experience or support the claim that the rate of adverse events per 
administration decrease with successive administrations of botulinum toxin. Accordingly, a 
non-interventional PASS is required to quantify safety concerns and to provide additional 
characterisation of the long-term safety of Nuceiva. The study synopsis was provided and agreed. The 
study protocol will be submitted for agreement 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety: 
- Non-interventional PASS is required to quantify safety concerns, including eye disorders, and to provide 
additional characterisation of the long-term safety of Nuceiva. 
- Re-test previously negative sera from studies EV-001, EV-002, EV-004, EV006 using new binding ADA 
assays for screening, confirmation and determination of ADA titres, supported by a sensitive assay for 
neutralising ADA. These studies will be supported by post-marketing surveillance to monitor for cases of 
hypersensitivity that may be caused by ADA formation.  
- When possible, subjects who are non-responders will also be asked to have a blood sample tested for 
NAb using the mouse hemi-diaphragm model.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 2.0 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
Based on indication, the CHMP is of the opinion that a separate entry in the EURD list for Nuceiva is 
needed, as it cannot follow the already existing entry for botulinum toxin type A. The requirements for 
submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the Annex II, Section 
C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request the alignment of the new PSUR cycle with the 
international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 16.08.2018. The new EURD list entry will therefore use the IBD 
to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that botulinum toxin type A has been previously authorised in a medicinal product 
in the European Union but differs significantly with regard to safety and/or efficacy due to differences in 
the manufacturing process as it is significantly purer than other medicinal products that are available in 
the European Union. Botulinum toxin Type A is an active substance previously authorised in the European 
Union and contained in medicinal products as Botox/Vistabel, Dysport/Azzalure and Xeomin/Bocouture. 
The differences in manufacturing processes alone are not sufficient to establish new active substance 
status and are only relevant when it can be demonstrated that they are linked to differences in safety or 
efficacy profile for the resulting product. 
Significantly different properties in terms of safety/efficacy have not been demonstrated and no data has 
been provided to support that the manufacturing process differences described in the submission result in 
a product with a significantly different safety/efficacy profile. 
The applicant acknowledged the CHMP position and has withdrawn the New Active Substance claim during 
the procedure. 
Based on the available quality and clinical data, the CHMP considers, that botulinum toxin type A, which 
have some differences in molecular structure, nature of the source material or manufacturing process, 
does not differ significantly in properties with regard to safety and/or efficacy from botulinum toxin type 
A contained in medicinal product(s) previously authorised within the European Union and therefore is not 
considered to be a new active substance 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
EMA/281737/2019 
Page 117/131 
 
 
  
 
 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Nuceiva (botulinum toxin type A) is included in 
the additional monitoring list as it is a biological product and authorised after 1 January 2011.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
All the available clinical studies are in healthy adults >18 years old. A single clinical study examines 
psychological impact in otherwise healthy adults with moderate to severe glabellar lines.  
In other clinical context, not the subject of this application, botulinum toxin type A injections are used to 
induce cholinergic blockade at the neuromuscular junction for temporary therapeutic flaccid muscle 
paralysis in focal muscle spasticity and striated muscle related pain syndromes; afferent parasympathetic 
cholinergic blockade inducing detrusor muscle relaxation in bladder dysfunction; cholinergic blockade for 
relief of autonomic syndromes such as axillary hyperhidrosis and excessive salivation. 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The claimed indication is: NUCEIVA is indicated for the temporary improvement in the appearance of 
moderate to severe vertical lines between the eyebrows seen at maximum frown (glabellar lines), when 
the severity of the above facial lines has an important psychological impact in adult patients. 
For the claimed indication, evidence of psychological impact was addressed in the pivotal study (EVB003) 
at the baseline assessment using a subject’s simple verbal response. This is in line with clinical practice 
where practitioners consult with patients and assess the psychological impact of the glabellar lines prior 
to administering botulinum toxin A, to ensure it is an appropriate treatment for their patient. There are no 
validated scales to assess the psychological impact in this specific patient population.  
Although use of scales / patient-reported outcomes that have been specifically validated in the target 
population are generally preferred, it is acknowledged that such scales are not available in this case. 
However, the GASI and SSS scores used in the submitted studies are considered sufficiently applicable to 
investigate patient benefit in the proposed target population. 
Different efficacy endpoints were used in the European and US studies to favour clinical and statistical 
perspectives without addressing the limitations of assessment methods, and whether a smaller or larger 
effect is required to achieve the optimal level of residual facial expression at maximum frown or at rest, 
and for standard variables such as age, gender, or race.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Three botulinum toxin A preparations are licensed for use in the EU for treatment of glabellar lines 
(Vistabel, Bocouture, Azzalure). All three are licensed for use using mutual recognition procedures, and 
the indication for use in each case refers to the treatment of glabellar lines that have an important 
psychological impact for the patient. 
EMA/281737/2019 
Page 118/131 
 
 
  
 
 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Each study recruited healthy adults >18 years old with moderate or severe GLs at maximum frown. The 
European pivotal multi-centre study EVB003 was a non-inferiority, active treatment and placebo 
randomised controlled single treatment trial of DWP-450 versus Botox versus Placebo for the temporary 
improvement of moderate or severe glabellar lines (GLs) at maximum frown where the severity has an 
important psychological impact in adults; 540 subjects recruited. In addition, two confirmatory US 
placebo-controlled studies recruited 330 and 324 subjects for a randomised single treatment trial of 
DWP-450, without assessing psychological impact.  
Information on multiple administration is dependent on two uncontrolled open label repeat treatment 
safety studies of DWP-450 in the US recruiting 352 and 570 subjects respectively, without assessment of 
psychological impact in line with the “cosmetic” use of this type of product approved in the US (Botox® 
Cosmetic). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The collected data from the pivotal and supportive clinical studies confirmed the efficacy of the product in 
the intended indication. They demonstrated the ability of the product to not only exert a physiological 
activity on the appearance of moderate to severe vertical lines between the eyebrows, but also induce a 
beneficial psychological impact in adults below 65 years of age, with this condition. The main data 
supporting these benefits are listed below: 
• 
• 
The non-inferiority margin for absolute difference for the primary endpoint, a GLS score of 0 or 1 
at maximum frown at day 30 by IA, was 4.4 (95% CI -1.9, 10.8) for DWP-450 vs Botox, within the 
-10% non-inferiority margin. 
The absolute differences between Botox and Placebo, DWP-450 and Placebo for the primary 
endpoint, were 78.6% and 83.1%, respectively (both p<0.001).  
•  A >2 point improvement in the GLS score at maximum frown at day 30 by IA was seen in 0/48 
placebo, 168/244 (68.9%) Botox and 181/235 (77%) DWP-450 treated subjects. Assessment by 
subjects was supportive.  
• 
• 
• 
The mean change (95% CI) from baseline in day 90 HADS-A scores was -0.9 (-1.7, -0.2) for 
Placebo vs -0.9 (-1.3, -0.6) for Botox vs -1.1 (-1.4, -0.8) for DWP-450, and for HADS-D scores 
was -0.5 (-1.1, 0.0) vs -0.6 (-0.9, -0.3) vs -0.6 (-0.9, -0.3) respectively. The absolute difference 
from placebo for the change in HADS-A scores from baseline to day 90 after DWP-450 was -0.2 
(-0.9, 0.6), and for HADS-D scores was -0.1 (-0.7, 0.6), no significant difference. 
The mean absolute difference in subjects with a >1 point improvement in the Subject Satisfaction 
Scale score was 85.0 p<0.001 for DWP-450 versus placebo and 4.7 (-0.9, 10.2) for DWP-450 
versus Botox.  
The percentages of positive responders on the GAIS and SSS scores support the analyses based 
on the GLS scores. 
In addition, the pooled data from EV001, EV002 (with placebo values for EV001, EV002, EVB003), where 
a >2point improvement in GLS score at maximum frown by IA and SA at day 30 was the primary 
endpoint, showed an absolute difference from placebo that was significant across skin types e.g. type III 
of 64.6 (95% CI 56.7, 71.6), type IV 63.4 (49.3, 73.9), type V 72.4 (29.9, 87.4), and type VI 66.7 (2.0, 
90.1). 
There were high rates of subject satisfaction using PROs (GAIS score by SA and the SSS), which although 
not validated, were considered relevant for Nuceiva treatment as a large difference from placebo was 
EMA/281737/2019 
Page 119/131 
 
 
  
 
 
demonstrated and similar effect was seen compared to Botox, which is considered to adequately reflect 
the expected benefit. 
In the open label studies EV004 and EV006, up to 50% of subjects required 4 administrations of DWP-450 
over 1 year to maintain a GLS score <2 at maximum frown and the interval between treatments 
decreased as the number of treatments increased.     
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Multiple administration 
•  There are insufficient data to robustly conclude on the expected clinical efficacy of multiple doses 
application (a situation that will be frequent in clinical practice). This is due to the fact that the 
uncontrolled open label studies EV004, EV006 were primarily safety studies not designed to 
assess long-term and multiple-dose efficacy, and that there was no active controlled extension of 
study EVB003. 
Validation of Assessment Tools 
•  Validity of the key endpoints, GLS scores by IA, are limited by suboptimal kappa coefficients of 
interrater agreement for assessment at maximum frown (0.635) and unreliable values at rest 
(0.512) pre-trial, together with the lack of validation “in the field” 
• 
Photographic images were recorded but no independent centralised assessment was performed, 
and the applicant regards the images as inadequate for retrospective cross-validation 
•  Neither GLS score by SA or GAIS score by IA were validated for the intended use. 
•  No validated PROs were used from the range of generic and specific clinical tools available. 
Blinding 
•  High risk of unblinding was detected due to a strong treatment effect, unbalanced randomisation, 
and the absence of independent centralised assessment, in the context of high rates of previous 
exposure to botulinum toxin. 
• 
Treatment response rates for the primary endpoint in EV001 & EV002 (a >2point improvement in 
GLS score at maximum frown by IA and SA at day 30) were higher in subjects with vs without 
prior history of botulinum toxin use, absolute difference from placebo 73.3% (95% CI 64.1, 79.9) 
vs 64.0% (57.7, 69.6).  
•  Concerns about the risk of unblinding are supported by large variation between study sites in the 
response rate by primary endpoint, 60% vs 100% in study EVB003, whilst studies EV001, EV002 
exhibit 5-fold variations in responses rates by study site and 5-fold variations in differences in 
response by gender between these otherwise identical studies.  
EMA/281737/2019 
Page 120/131 
 
 
  
 
 
Immunogenicity 
• 
• 
• 
• 
There are no immunogenicity data from the pivotal study EVB003, so there are no contemporary 
comparative data with an established product.  
The immunogenicity assessment is reliant on data from the other randomised clinical trials and 
open label studies, compromised by insensitive, poorly validated assays which generate rates of 
binding Abs and NAbs that are substantially lower than in the literature.  
Therefore the strong link between ADA and secondary non-response, as reported in a systematic 
review and meta-analysis, is not adequately assessed.   
The immunogenicity assessment is inadequate to compare freeze-dried product with 5% overage 
with the lyophilised product with 50% overage of botulinum toxin protein but LD50 matched 
levels of toxin activity associated with seroconversion in study EV004.  
Psychological impact  
Changes in HADS scores assessed at day 90 showed no benefit over placebo for the psychological impact 
of DWP-450 treatment, but the failure to show a clear benefit on this rating scale can be explained by the 
fact that, at baseline, the majority of patients were within normal HADS A and D scores. In addition, the 
HADS tool has not been validated for the target population of this application and may be insensitive to 
detect changes following treatment. However, for the intended context of use it was considered that the 
demonstrated favourable results on patient reported outcomes were sufficient. Reassuringly similar 
results were seen compared to Botox.  
Dose response 
•  No clinical dose response studies were performed. The single 20U dose used is based on a claim 
of matching dose comparability with Botox, in preclinical studies and Korean clinical studies, 
which used a different, lyophilised preparation which has a 50%.  
• 
The single 20U dose regimen is based on dose comparability with Botox, but expert medical 
consensus recommends doses of Botox for GLs as low as 8U for some patients, and clinical safety 
data with DWP-450 suggests dose adjustment by sex, age >65 years, and GLS score at baseline 
may be appropriate.  
Age 
• 
• 
Few subjects >65 years were included in study EVB003, where the non-inferiority margin for 
absolute difference for the primary endpoint, a GLS score of 0 or 1 at maximum frown at day 30 
by IA was 14.6 (-14.4, 43.6) for DWP-450 (n=16) versus Botox (n=18).  
The number of older subjects studied was too small to address concerns about the efficacy of 
botulinum toxin in this group where the pathogenesis of wrinkles reflects gravity-induced tissue 
sagging due to thinner, less elastic skin, weaker facial muscles as well as muscle contraction. 
•  Similarly, it is unknown whether dose adjustment is required to achieve the optimal level of 
residual facial expression including in subjects >65 years. 
Gender  
• 
Pooled data from EV001, EV002 (with placebo values for EV001, EV002, EVB003), where a 
>2point improvement in GLS score at maximum frown by IA and SA at day 30 was the primary 
endpoint showed treatment responses were lower in males than females 53.5 (35.5, 68.8) versus 
69.4 (64.5, 73.8). 
EMA/281737/2019 
Page 121/131 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Duration of Response 
• 
The median time to response, using >2point improvement in GLS at maximum frown by IA and 
SA, was 10 days in studies EV001, EV002.  
•  Median (iqr) duration of treatment response (maintenance of a >2point improvement in GLS 
score at maximum frown by IA) was 78 (68, 91) days in EVB003, vs 85 (76, 113) days in EV001 
vs 86 (78, 113) days in EV002 the other RCTs.  
Optimal level of residual facial expression after botulinum toxin treatment 
• 
• 
Post- hoc analysis of treatment response, according to GLS at maximum frown by IA, indicates 
 Subjects with a baseline score of 2 achieved a day 30 score of 0 & 1 in 56.5% & 40.3% 
•  Subjects with a baseline score of 3 achieved a day 30 score of 0 & 1 in 22.9% & 60.3% 
respectively.  
Race  
• 
• 
The limitations of unvalidated PROs are exacerbated by the absence of subjects from Southern 
and Eastern Europe in the European EVB003 study, precluding investigation of any differences in 
treatment effects and expectation.  
The pivotal study EVB003 included only 3 Black/African American and 6 Asian subjects, and 
overall racial groups other than white are poorly represented precluding investigation of TEAEs of 
special interest 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The side effect profile of the active substance Botulinum toxin is well known and includes headache, local 
muscle weakness, muscle twitching and eyelid ptosis. Adverse events directly related to administration 
can include injection site haematoma, haemorrhage and pain or paraesthesia at the injection site. Local 
spread of toxin effects is reported with eye disorders including blepharospasm, eyelid ptosis, eyebrow 
drooping and diplopia. Distant spread of toxin effects is uncommon, is more likely at higher doses and at 
other injection sites, but includes dysphonia, dysphagia and dyspnoea.  
In study EVB003, the rate of TEAEs is higher than placebo (32.7%) for both Botox (41.9%) and DWP-450 
(37.6%), and similarly for Drug related TEAEs at 4.1% vs 14.6% vs 15.4 % respectively. The most 
common TEAE was headache at 14.3% for placebo, 10.2% Botox, and 13.9% for DWP-450. 
The rate of TEAEs is similar between placebo and DWP-450 in studies EV001 and EV002 at 32.1% versus 
38.2%, incident difference 6.1 (-6.3, 18.3) and 26.9% versus 28.5%, 1.5 (-11.2, 14.2) respectively. 
There was a small excess of Drug related TEAEs at 13% vs 15% in study EV001 and 8% versus 10% in 
study EV002. The most common TEAE is headache after both placebo and DWP-450. 
Injection site bruising, pain or swelling related to study drug occurred in 1.6% after placebo versus 2.4% 
after DWP-450 injections in study EVB003.  
TEAEs leading to Discontinuation were uncommon at <0.1% after single or multiple treatments with 
DWP-450. 
EMA/281737/2019 
Page 122/131 
 
 
  
 
 
Excess TEAEs after multiple versus single administration of DWP-450 
Repeated administration of Botulinum toxin by i.m. injection is typically performed and therefore the rate 
of frequency of TEAEs both after each administration and over the whole treatment course are relevant to 
the safety assessment. Overall, rates of TEAEs and TEAEs of special interest are increased after repeated 
versus single doses of DWP-450. 
Pooled analysis of studies of TEAEs after a single treatment (EV001, EV002, EVB003) versus multiple 
treatments (EV004, EV006) for placebo vs single vs multiple administrations showed TEAE rates of 30.3% 
vs 34.5% vs 41.5%; serious TEAEs 0.5% vs 1.4% vs 1.5%, and TEAEs of special interest 0.5% vs 2.7% 
vs 2.9%; whilst Drug related TEAEs were 9% vs 13.4% vs 12.1%.  
Local Spread of Toxin Effects: Eye disorders 
Within TEAEs of special interest, eye disorders including blepharospasm, eyelid ptosis, eyebrow drooping 
and diplopia are common at 0% after placebo, 1.6% Botox, 2.0% single treatment DWP450, 1.8% 
multiple treatments of DWP-450. 
Distant Spread of Toxin Effects 
Distant effects are uncommon but increased after multiple administrations: 
•  Dysphonia 0% placebo, 0.1% single, 0% multiple administrations of DWP-450 
•  Dyspnoea 0.5% placebo, 0.1% single, 0.2% multiple administrations of DWP-450 
•  Dysphagia 0% placebo, 0.1% single, 0.2% multiple administrations of DWP-450 
•  Speech disorder 0% placebo, 0.1% single, 0.2%* multiple administrations of DWP-450.  
*Two subjects (0.12%, 2/1659) had transient disorder of speech regarded as related to study drug  
Hypersensitivity 
Possible hypersensitivity reactions occurred in 1.4% after placebo, 1.6% single, 1.5% after multiple 
administration of DWP-450. Hypersensitivity reactions assessed as related to study drug occurred in 
0.4% (6/1659) of subjects who had eyelid oedema, injection site pruritus, and influenza like illness. 
Immunogenicity 
ADA were uncommon, detected pre-trial in 1 of 654 subjects in EV001, EV002; 2 of 352 subjects 
seroconverted after 2xDWP-450 administrations in E004 and 1 of 560 subjects pre-trial in study EV006. 
One of the 4 ADA positive subjects were non-responders to DWP-450 treatment. 
Excess TEAEs in older subjects 
There is an inconsistent excess of all TEAEs in subjects >65 years than <65 years in the clinical studies, 
EVB003 23.5% vs 38.6%; EV001 53.8% vs 36.4%, EV002 33.3 vs 27.9%; EV004 48.5% vs 41.4%, 
EV006 39.2%, 41.4% respectively. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Multiple administration 
•  No direct comparison is available between multiple vs single administration of DWP-450 in the 
absence of an active controlled extension of the pivotal study EVB003.  
EMA/281737/2019 
Page 123/131 
 
 
  
 
 
•  Subjects in the uncontrolled open-label multiple dose studies EV004, EV006 have different 
characteristics to the subjects in the single dose RCTs and subject dropout is poorly characterised 
which limits the value of indirect comparison. 
Immunogenicity 
• 
The sensitivity and validation of the Immunogenicity assays was inadequate 
•  No immunogenicity assessment was performed in the pivotal study EVB003 
• 
The contribution of ADA to secondary non-response is not adequately addressed 
Muscle atrophy 
•  Muscle wasting is presented as an inevitable part of treatment, representing disease atrophy after 
the induction of flaccid paralysis by botulinum toxin. 
•  Muscle wasting is consistent with recent data showing loss of muscle volume persisting 12 
months after a single administration of botulinum toxin type A, and muscle volume loss with fat 
accumulation after multiple administrations  
• 
The clinical significance of this muscle atrophy is unclear 
Age 
The small number of older subjects studied has not addressed key safety concerns  
• 
• 
• 
Race 
• 
Increased risk of eye disorders in older subjects given many use the frontalis muscle to raise their 
eyebrows and eyelids to see, have extra skin under the brow (pseudoptosis), or have a reduced 
or absent orbital septum 
Increased susceptibility to bruising due to delicate skin 
Increased susceptibility to bruising due to common prescribed or over the counter medications 
such as anti-inflammatory agents, anti-coagulants, anti-platelet agents and aspirin. 
Potential differences between racial groups in rates of TEAEs and TEAEs of special interest are not 
assessable because of the small number of non-white subjects.  
Skin type 
•  Case numbers are too small to confirm the trend of higher rates of TEAEs of special interest in 
subjects with fair skin (II) versus light brown skin (IV).  
Dose 
• 
The absence of dose response studies precludes comparison of dose versus safety.  
Concomitant therapies 
• 
Interaction with concomitant therapies was not investigated although expert medical consensus 
note co-treatment with dermal fillers would be used in 21% of subjects with GLs.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
A single treatment with DWP-450 induces temporary improvement in moderate to severe glabellar lines 
at maximum frown in most cases, similarly to Botox and unlike placebo which has little effect. For the 
claimed indication, evidence of psychological impact with a subject’s simple verbal confirmation of 
psychological impact at baseline was obtained.  This is in line with the approach taken in clinical practice. 
The day 90 change in HADS scores versus baseline is no different from placebo, but failure to show a clear 
benefit on this rating scale may be explained as this scale is not validated for this specific patients 
population and the baseline scores at enrolment were for the majority in the normal range. In a subset of 
patients who had higher scores demonstrated a favourable effect similar to Botox.   Similar to Botox, the 
active comparator used in the pivotal trial, a beneficial effect on psychological wellbeing could not be 
shown as compared to placebo, but significant effects on patient reported outcomes were demonstrated.  
Overall, efficacy of Nuceiva can be considered non-inferior to Botox. 
There are uncertainties around efficacy of DWP-450 in the pivotal study EVB003 due to the lack of an 
active controlled extension to assess the clinical efficacy of multiple doses typical of clinical practice, and 
the use of unvalidated PROs. The supportive open-label studies are not designed as efficacy studies and 
they do not examine the drivers to repeat administration from either the physician or subject perspective, 
or account adequately for subject dropout. The efficacy data from the supporting single dose RCTs EV001, 
EV002 are limited by a strong treatment effect, the lack of independent centralised assessment, and 
unbalanced randomisation, in the context of high rates of previous exposure. These factors generate 
concerns about the robustness of blinding, which are potentially reflected in the 5-fold variations in 
responses rates by study site and 5-fold variation in the rate difference between genders in otherwise 
identical studies. 
The immunogenicity data are poor and unreliable with no data from the pivotal study EVB003, whilst data 
from the other RCTs and open label studies are compromised by insensitive, poorly validated assays 
which generate rates of binding Abs and NAbs which are substantially lower than in the literature. The 
clinical relevance of NAbs is underlined by high rates in secondary non-responders reported in systematic 
review and meta-analysis.  
Despite the uncertainties listed above, the CHMP is of the opinion that the totality of the gathered efficacy 
data is sufficient to provide reassurance for a consistent and well-demonstrated effect, in the intended 
indication.  
No new side-effects are reported and the type and incidence of ADRs are broadly comparable and in line 
with those expected from the active substance. Due to the RCTs and open label studies design, there are 
some uncertainties about the short term safety, including a 2% rate of eye disorders, and the long term 
EMA/281737/2019 
Page 126/131 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
safety of DWP-450.  The CHMP agreed that the safety profile of DWP-450 did not raise any major concerns 
and is sufficiently established at this stage. In order to have more robust safety, better quantify the safety 
concerns and provide additional characterisation of the long-term safety of Nuceiva, a non-interventional 
PASS is required. 
The treatment response is seen in males and females; across Fitzpatrick skin types when pooled analyses 
are considered, is temporary and reproducible for up to 4 treatments. Too few subjects >65 years old 
were studied to provide confidence in either efficacy or safety in this age group. Post hoc analysis provides 
rates for a range of treatment responses in subjects grouped by the baseline severity glabellar lines at 
maximum frown by IA.  
Matching dose comparability to Botox is claimed based on Korean clinical studies not presented here that 
used a different lyophilised preparation, together with preclinical data which do not allow for any 
differences in diffusion of drug within the tissues. Dose response studies were omitted from the Korean 
clinical studies and the Evolus programme, and a fixed dose of 20U was used throughout. This contrasts 
with expert medical consensus on the use of Botox for glabellar lines, which recommends tailoring the 
dose to the individual down to 8U in some cases. Thus, there is no experience with DWP-450 to guide 
tailoring the dose to the benefit/risk balance as prompted by differences in treatment response by age, 
sex, and prior treatment with botulinum toxin. Persistence of effect after repeat treatment was consistent 
with that seen in the placebo controlled setting. Reduced efficacy in the elderly and in males could have 
implications for dosing and treatment strategies. This has been identified with other botulinum toxin 
products and has been addressed in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The review of the data shows that Nuceiva significantly reduces the severity of glabellar lines at maximum 
frown. The temporary changes last for up to 139 days. In order to maintain an effect, it is expected that 
Nuceiva is administered repeatedly. 
The psychological impact of glabellar lines was confirmed at study entry in the pivotal trial. While a 
positive psychological impact was not demonstrated using the HADS score, this instrument may not be 
appropriate to reflect the situation in the intended population of use. The data have demonstrated 
favourable patient reported outcomes, which were statistically significantly higher for Nuceiva compared 
to placebo and similar to the active comparator.  
Considering the totality of efficacy evidence, it is considered that sufficient supportive evidence of efficacy 
for the type of medicinal product and the intended context of use in clinical practice has been provided.  
The safety profile is in line with those of other similar products. In view of the available data, there are 
some uncertainties regarding repeated administration and long-term safety, as well as immunogenicity. 
There is also a high rate of eye disorders which deserves further investigation. In the view of these 
uncertainties, appropriate measures have been put in place to gather and assess the relevant data in the 
post-marketing setting.  
Overall, the benefit/risk of Nuceiva is positive. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
This product is restricted to use by physicians with appropriate qualifications and expertise in this 
treatment and use of the required equipment. 
The claim to new active substance status is not supported on quality or efficacy or safety grounds, has 
been withdrawn by the applicant, and this MAA is now for a known active substance. 
EMA/281737/2019 
Page 127/131 
 
 
  
 
 
Nuceiva is available in a 100U vial and this may present a risk of incorrect drug administration due to the 
recommended dose of 20U. In order to minimize the risk, appropriate wording is implemented in the 
Product Information so Nuceiva is only used for a single patient during a single session. The applicant also 
committed to develop and replace the 100U vial by a 50U vial within 3 months of the Commission 
Decision. 
The routine control of biological activity of the finished product of Nuceiva is performed by means of an 
LD50 method currently as per the current standards of the Ph. Eur. Taking into account the requirements 
of  Directive  2010/63/EU  and  the  technical  feasibility  to  develop  an  alternative  method,  the  CHMP 
believes that it is important to request the conduct the development of an in vitro alternative method to 
replace the LD50 method in routine control of the finished product by September 2020.  An Annex II 
condition to the Marketing Authorisation has been requested accordingly. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Nuceiva is positive for the temporary improvement of the glabellar lines when the 
severity of these has an important psychological impact. 
Divergent position is appended to this report. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by majority 
decision that the risk-benefit balance of Nuceiva is favourable in the following indication: 
NUCEIVA is indicated for the temporary improvement in the appearance of moderate to severe vertical 
lines between the eyebrows seen at maximum frown (glabellar lines), when the severity of the above 
facial lines has an important psychological impact in adults below 65 years of age. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2).

Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed 
RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the 
RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of 
an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Obligation to conduct post-authorisation measures 
The MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the below measures: 
Description 
Introduction of an in vitro method as a replacement for the potency assay of the 
Nuceiva finished product. 
Due date 
September 2020 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the review of the available data, the CHMP considers that botulinum toxin type A, which have 
some differences in molecular structure, nature of the source material or manufacturing process, does not 
differ significantly in properties with regard to safety and/or efficacy from botulinum toxin type A 
contained in medicinal product(s) previously authorised within the European Union and therefore is not 
considered to be a new active substance.

DIVERGENT POSITION DATED 25 July 2019 
Nuceiva EMEA/H/C/004587/0000 
The undersigned members of the CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s positive opinion recommending 
the granting of the marketing authorisation of Nuceiva indicated for the “temporary improvement in the 
appearance  of  moderate  to  severe  vertical  lines  between  the  eyebrows  seen  at  maximum  frown 
(glabellar lines), when the severity of the above facial lines has an important psychological impact in 
adults below 65 years of age”.  
The reason for divergent opinion was the following: 
The proposed use of an in vivo LD50 potency assay for routine batch release violates current principles 
and standards on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes, as set out in EC Directive 
2010/63, and is considered unacceptable.  
• 
There is no medical need that would justify the use of the LD50 animal assay as other similar 
Botulinum toxin products are available on the market for the same indication. All of these 
products employ in vitro cell based potency assays for routine batch release. There is no valid 
scientific reason for not having developed an alternative in-vitro assay for routine release of the 
new product.  
•  A commitment to develop a cell based potency assay post approval cannot be accepted; this 
should have been done during the pharmaceutical development of the product. The timelines 
proposed by the applicant are merely assumptions and thus the transition period where animal 
are still used might be exceeded significantly.  
For the aforementioned reasons the marketing authorisation application is considered to be not 
approvable.

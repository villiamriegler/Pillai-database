Clear, colourless solution.  
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications  
Lyxumia is indicated for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus to achieve glycaemic 
control in combination with oral glucose-lowering medicinal products and/or basal insulin when these, 
together, with diet and exercise, do not provide adequate glycaemic control (see sections 4.4 and 5.1 
for available data on the different combinations). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration  
Posology 
Starting dose: dosing is initiated at 10 mcg lixisenatide once daily for 14 days. 
Maintenance dose: a fixed maintenance dose of 20 mcg lixisenatide once daily is started on Day 15.   
For the starting dose Lyxumia 10 micrograms solution for injection is available. 
For the maintenance dose Lyxumia 20 micrograms solution for injection is available. 
When Lyxumia is added to existing metformin therapy, the current metformin dose can be continued 
unchanged. 
When Lyxumia is added to existing therapy of a sulphonylurea or a basal insulin, a reduction in the 
dose of the sulphonylurea or the basal insulin may be considered to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. 
Lyxumia should not be given in combination with basal insulin and a sulphonylurea due to increased 
risk of hypoglycaemia (see section 4.4).  
The use of Lyxumia does not require specific blood glucose monitoring. However, when used in 
combination with a sulphonylurea or a basal insulin, blood glucose monitoring or blood glucose 
self-monitoring may become necessary to adjust the doses of the sulphonylurea or the basal insulin.

Special populations 
Elderly  
No dose adjustment is required based on age. 
Patients with renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.  
There is no therapeutic experience in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less 
than 30 ml/min) or end-stage renal disease and therefore, it is not recommended to use lixisenatide in 
these populations (see section 5.2). 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is needed in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2) 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of lixisenatide in children and adolescents less than 18 years of age have not 
been established (see section 5.1). No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Lyxumia is to be injected subcutaneously in the thigh, abdomen or upper arm. Lyxumia should not be 
administered intravenously or intramuscularly. 
The injection is administered once daily, within the hour prior to any meal of the day. It is preferable 
that the prandial injection of Lyxumia is performed before the same meal every day, when the most 
convenient meal has been chosen. If a dose is missed, it should be injected within the hour prior to the 
next meal.  
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
There is no therapeutic experience with lixisenatide in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and it 
should not be used in these patients. Lixisenatide should not be used for treatment of diabetic 
ketoacidosis. 
Acute pancreatitis  
Use of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists has been associated with a risk of 
developing acute pancreatitis. There have been few reported events of acute pancreatitis with 
lixisenatide although a causal relationship has not been established. Patients should be informed of the 
characteristic symptoms of acute pancreatitis: persistent, severe abdominal pain. If pancreatitis is 
suspected, lixisenatide should be discontinued; if acute pancreatitis is confirmed, lixisenatide should 
not be restarted. Caution should be exercised in patients with a history of pancreatitis. 
Severe gastrointestinal disease 
Use of GLP-1 receptor agonists may be associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions. Lixisenatide 
has not been studied in patients with severe gastrointestinal disease, including severe gastroparesis and 
therefore, the use of lixisenatide is not recommended in these patients. 
Renal impairment 
There is no therapeutic experience in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less 
than 30 ml/min) or end-stage renal disease. Use is not recommended in patients with severe renal 
impairment or end-stage renal disease (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).

Hypoglycaemia 
Patients receiving Lyxumia with a sulphonylurea or with a basal insulin may have an increased risk of 
hypoglycaemia. Reduction of the dose of the sulphonylurea or the basal insulin may be considered to 
reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia (see section 4.2). Lixisenatide should not be given in combination 
with basal insulin and a sulphonylurea due to increased risk of hypoglycaemia. 
Concomitant medicinal products 
The delay of gastric emptying with lixisenatide may reduce the rate of absorption of orally 
administered medicinal products. Lixisenatide should be used with caution in patients receiving oral 
medicinal products that require rapid gastrointestinal absorption, require careful clinical monitoring or 
have a narrow therapeutic ratio. Specific recommendations regarding intake of such medicinal 
products are given in section 4.5. 
Populations not studied 
Lixisenatide has not been studied in combination with dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. 
Dehydration 
Patients treated with lixisenatide should be advised of the potential risk of dehydration in relation to 
gastrointestinal adverse reactions and take precautions to avoid fluid depletion. 
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains metacresol, which may cause allergic reactions.  
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e., essentially 
“sodium-free”. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
Lixisenatide is a peptide and is not metabolised by cytochrome P450. In in vitro studies, lixisenatide 
did not affect the activity of cytochrome P450 isozymes or human transporters tested. 
The delay of gastric emptying with lixisenatide may reduce the rate of absorption of orally 
administered medicinal products. Patients receiving medicinal products of either a narrow therapeutic 
ratio or medicinal products that require careful clinical monitoring should be followed closely, 
especially at the time of initiation of lixisenatide treatment. These medicinal products should be taken 
in a standardised way in relation to lixisenatide. If such medicinal products are to be administered with 
food, patients should be advised to, if possible, take them with a meal when lixisenatide is not 
administered. 
For oral medicinal products that are particularly dependent on threshold concentrations for efficacy, 
such as antibiotics, patients should be advised to take those medicinal products at least 1 hour before 
or 4 hours after lixisenatide injection. 
Gastro-resistant formulations containing substances sensitive to stomach degradation, should be 
administered 1 hour before or 4 hours after lixisenatide injection. 
Paracetamol 
Paracetamol was used as a model medicinal product to evaluate the effect of lixisenatide on gastric 
emptying. Following administration of a single dose of paracetamol 1,000 mg, paracetamol AUC and 
t1/2 were unchanged whatever the timing of its administration (before or after the lixisenatide 
injection). When administered 1 or 4 hours after 10 mcg lixisenatide, Cmax of paracetamol was 
decreased by 29% and 31% respectively and median tmax was delayed by 2.0 and 1.75 hours 
respectively. A further delay in tmax and a reduced Cmax of paracetamol have been predicted with the 
20 mcg maintenance dose. 
No effects on paracetamol Cmax and tmax were observed when paracetamol was administered 1 hour 
before lixisenatide. 
Based on these results, no dose adjustment for paracetamol is required but the delayed tmax observed 
when paracetamol is administered 1-4 hours after lixisenatide should be taken into account when a 
rapid onset of action is required for efficacy. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Oral contraceptives  
Following administration of a single dose of an oral contraceptive medicinal product (ethinylestradiol 
0.03 mg/levonorgestrel 0.15 mg) 1 hour before or 11 hours after 10 mcg lixisenatide, the Cmax, AUC, 
t1/2 and tmax of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel were unchanged. 
Administration of the oral contraceptive 1 hour before or 4 hours after lixisenatide did not affect AUC 
and t1/2 of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel, whereas Cmax of ethinylestradiol was decreased by 52% 
and 39% respectively and Cmax of levonorgestrel was decreased by 46% and 20%, respectively and 
median tmax was delayed by 1 to 3 hours. 
The reduction in Cmax is of limited clinical relevance and no dose adjustment for oral contraceptives is 
required. 
Atorvastatin 
When lixisenatide 20 mcg and atorvastatin 40 mg were co-administered in the morning for 6 days, the 
exposure to atorvastatin was not affected, while Cmax was decreased by 31% and tmax was delayed by 
3.25 hours. 
No such increase for tmax was observed when atorvastatin was administered in the evening and 
lixisenatide in the morning but the AUC and Cmax of atorvastatin were increased by 27% and 66%, 
respectively. 
These changes are not clinically relevant and therefore, no dose adjustment for atorvastatin is required 
when co-administered with lixisenatide. 
Warfarin and other coumarin derivatives 
After concomitant administration of warfarin 25 mg with repeated dosing of lixisenatide 20 mcg, there 
were no effects on AUC or INR (International Normalised Ratio) while Cmax was reduced by 19% and 
tmax was delayed by 7 hours. 
Based on these results, no dose adjustment for warfarin is required when co-administered with 
lixisenatide; however, frequent monitoring of INR in patients on warfarin and/or coumarin derivatives 
is recommended at the time of initiation or ending of lixisenatide treatment. 
Digoxin 
After concomitant administration of lixisenatide 20 mcg and digoxin 0.25 mg at steady state, the AUC 
of digoxin was not affected. The tmax of digoxin was delayed by 1.5 hour and the Cmax was reduced by 
26%. 
Based on these results, no dose adjustment for digoxin is required when co-administered with 
lixisenatide. 
Ramipril 
After concomitant administration of lixisenatide 20 mcg and ramipril 5 mg during 6 days, the AUC of 
ramipril was increased by 21% while the Cmax was decreased by 63%. The AUC and Cmax of the active 
metabolite (ramiprilat) were not affected. The tmax of ramipril and ramiprilat were delayed by 
approximately 2.5 hours. 
Based on these results, no dose adjustment for ramipril is required when co-administered with 
lixisenatide. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Women of childbearing potential 
Lyxumia is not recommended in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. 
Pregnancy 
There are no adequate data from the use of Lyxumia in pregnant women. Studies in animals have 
shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Lyxumia 
should not be used during pregnancy. The use of insulin is recommended instead. If a patient wishes to 
become pregnant, or pregnancy occurs, treatment with Lyxumia should be discontinued. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown if Lyxumia is excreted in human milk. Lyxumia should not be used during 
breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
Animal studies do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
Lixisenatide has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines. When used in 
combination with a sulphonylurea or a basal insulin, patients should be advised to take precautions to 
avoid hypoglycaemia while driving and using machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile  
Over 2,600 patients have received Lyxumia either alone or in combination with metformin, a 
sulphonylurea (with or without metformin) or a basal insulin (with or without metformin, or with or 
without a sulphonylurea) in 8 large placebo- or active-controlled phase III studies.  
The most frequently reported adverse reactions during clinical studies were nausea, vomiting and 
diarrhoea. These reactions were mostly mild and transient.  
In addition, hypoglycaemia (when Lyxumia was used in combination with a sulphonylurea and/or a 
basal insulin) and headache occurred.  
Allergic reactions have been reported in 0.4% of Lyxumia patients.  
Tabulated list of adverse reactions  
Adverse reactions reported from placebo- and active-controlled phase III studies over the entire 
treatment period are presented in Table 1. The table presents adverse reactions that occurred with an 
incidence >5% if the frequency was higher among Lyxumia treated patients than patients treated with 
all comparators. The table also includes adverse reactions with a frequency ≥1% in the Lyxumia group 
if the frequency was greater than 2 times the frequency for all comparators group.  
Frequencies of adverse reactions are defined as: very common: ≥1/10; common: ≥1/100 to <1/10; 
uncommon: ≥1/1,000 to <1/100; rare: ≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000; very rare: <1/10,000). 
Within each system organ class, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing frequency.

Description of selected adverse reactions  
Hypoglycaemia  
In patients taking Lyxumia in monotherapy, symptomatic hypoglycaemia occurred in 1.7% of 
lixisenatide treated patients and in 1.6% of placebo treated patients. When Lyxumia is used in 
combination with metformin alone, symptomatic hypoglycaemia occurred in 7.0% of lixisenatide 
patients and in 4.8% of placebo patients during the entire treatment period. 
In patients taking Lyxumia in combination with a sulphonylurea and metformin, symptomatic 
hypoglycaemia occurred in 22.0% of lixisenatide treated patients and in 18.4% of placebo treated 
patients during the entire treatment period (3.6% absolute difference). When Lyxumia is used in 
combination with a basal insulin with or without metformin, symptomatic hypoglycaemia occurred in 
42.1% of lixisenatide patients and in 38.9% of placebo patients during the entire treatment period 
(3.2% absolute difference). 
During the entire treatment period, when Lyxumia was given with a sulphonylurea alone, symptomatic 
hypoglycaemia occurred in 22.7% of lixisenatide treated patients versus 15.2% with placebo (7.5% 
absolute difference). When Lyxumia was given with a sulphonylurea and a basal insulin, symptomatic

hypoglycaemia occurred in 47.2% of lixisenatide treated patients compared to 21.6% with placebo 
(25.6% absolute difference). 
Overall, the incidence of severe symptomatic hypoglycaemia was uncommon (0.4% in lixisenatide 
patients and 0.2% in placebo patients) during the entire treatment period of the Phase III 
placebo-controlled studies. 
Gastrointestinal disorders  
Nausea and vomiting were the most frequently reported adverse reactions during the main 24-week 
treatment period. The incidence of nausea was higher in the lixisenatide group (26.1%) compared to 
the placebo group (6.2%) and the incidence of vomiting was higher in the lixisenatide group (10.5%) 
than in the placebo group (1.8%). They were mostly mild and transient and occurred during the first 
3 weeks after starting treatment. Thereafter, they progressively decreased during the following weeks.  
Injection site reactions  
Injections site reactions were reported in 3.9% of the patients receiving Lyxumia while they were 
reported in 1.4% of patients receiving placebo during the main 24-week treatment period. The 
majority of reactions were mild in intensity and usually did not result in discontinuation of the 
treatment.  
Immunogenicity  
Consistent with the potentially immunogenic properties of medicinal products containing proteins or 
peptides, patients may develop anti-lixisenatide antibodies following treatment with Lyxumia and, at 
the end of the main 24-week treatment period in placebo-controlled studies, 69.8% of lixisenatide 
patients had a positive antibody status. The percentage of patients who were antibody positive was 
similar at the end of the entire 76-week treatment period. At the end of the main 24-week treatment 
period, 32.2% of the patients having a positive antibody status had an antibody concentration above 
the lower limit of quantification, and at the end of the entire 76-week treatment period, 44.7% of the 
patients had an antibody concentration above the lower limit of quantification. After stopping the 
treatment, few antibody positive patients were followed-up for antibody status; the percentage 
decreased to approximately 90% within 3 months and 30% at 6 months or beyond. 
The change in HbA1c from baseline was similar regardless of the antibody status (positive or negative). 
Of lixisenatide-treated patients with HbA1c measurement, 79.3% had either a negative antibody status 
or an antibody concentration below the lower limit of quantification and the other 20.7% of patients 
had a quantified antibody concentration. In the subset of patients (5.2%) with the highest antibody 
concentrations, the mean improvement in HbA1c at Week 24 and at Week 76 was in a clinically 
relevant range; however, there was variability in the glycaemic response and 1.9% had no decrease in 
HbA1c. 
The antibody status (positive or negative) is not predictive of the reduction of HbA1c for an individual 
patient. 
There was no difference in the overall safety profile in patients regardless of the antibody status with 
the exception of an increase of the incidence of injection site reactions (4.7% in antibody positive 
patients compared to 2.5% in antibody-negative patients during the entire treatment period). The 
majority of injection site reactions were mild, regardless of antibody status. 
There was no cross-reactivity versus either native glucagon or endogenous GLP-1. 
Allergic reactions 
Allergic reactions possibly associated with lixisenatide (such as anaphylactic reaction, angioedema 
and urticaria) have been reported in 0.4% of lixisenatide patients while possibly associated allergic 
reactions occurred in less than 0.1% of placebo patients during the main 24-week treatment period. 
Anaphylactic reactions were reported in 0.2% of the lixisenatide treated patients vs. none in the 
placebo group. Most of these reported allergic reactions were mild in severity. 
One case of anaphylactoid reaction was reported during clinical trials with lixisenatide. 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Heart rate 
In a study in healthy volunteers, a transient rise in heart rate has been observed after administration of 
lixisenatide 20 mcg.  Cardiac arrhythmias particularly tachycardia (0.8% vs <0.1%) and palpitations 
(1.5% vs 0.8%) have been reported in lixisenatide patients compared to placebo treated patients. 
Withdrawal  
The incidence of treatment discontinuation due to adverse events was 7.4% for Lyxumia compared to 
3.2% in the placebo group during the main 24-week treatment period. The most common adverse 
reactions which led to treatment discontinuation in the lixisenatide group were nausea (3.1%) and 
vomiting (1.2%).  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.  
4.9  Overdose  
During clinical studies, doses up to 30 mcg of lixisenatide twice a day were administered to type 2 
diabetic patients in a 13-week study. An increased incidence of gastrointestinal disorders was 
observed.  
In case of overdose, appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated according to the patient’s 
clinical signs and symptoms and the lixisenatide dose should be reduced to the prescribed dose.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in Diabetes, Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues, 
ATC code: A10BJ03  
Mechanism of action 
Lixisenatide is a selective GLP-1 receptor agonist. The GLP-1 receptor is the target for native GLP-1, 
an endogenous incretin hormone that potentiates glucose-dependent insulin secretion from the 
pancreatic beta cells. 
Lixisenatide action is mediated via a specific interaction with GLP-1 receptors, leading to an increase 
in intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Lixisenatide stimulates insulin secretion 
when blood glucose is increased but not at normoglycaemia, which limits the risk of hypoglycaemia. 
In parallel, glucagon secretion is suppressed. In case of hypoglycaemia, the rescue mechanism of 
glucagon secretion is preserved. 
Lixisenatide slows gastric emptying thereby reducing the rate at which meal-derived glucose appears 
in the circulation. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
When administered once daily, lixisenatide improves glycaemic control through the immediate and 
sustained effects of lowering both post-prandial and fasting glucose concentrations in patients with 
type 2 diabetes. 
This effect on post-prandial glucose was confirmed in a 4-week study versus liraglutide 1.8 mg once a 
day in combination with metformin. Reduction from baseline in the AUC0:30-4:30 h of plasma glucose 
after a test-meal was: -12.61 h*mmol/L (-227.25 h*mg/dl) in the lixisenatide group 
and -4.04 h*mmol/L (-72.83 h*mg/dl) in the liraglutide group. This was also confirmed in an 8-week 
study versus liraglutide, administered before breakfast, in combination with insulin glargine with or 
without metformin.

Clinical efficacy and safety 
The clinical efficacy and safety of Lyxumia were evaluated in nine randomised double-blind, 
placebo-controlled clinical studies including 4,508 patients with type 2 diabetes (2,869 patients 
randomised to lixisenatide, 47.5% men and 52.5% women, and 517 were ≥65 years of age). 
Efficacy of Lyxumia was also assessed in two randomised, open-label, active-controlled study (versus 
exenatide or versus insulin glulisine) and in a mealtime study (in total 1,067 patients randomised to 
lixisenatide). 
Efficacy and safety of Lyxumia in patients older than 70 years was addressed in a specifically 
dedicated placebo-controlled study (176 patients randomised to lixisenatide, including 62 patients ≥75 
years of age). 
In addition, a double-blind, placebo-controlled cardiovascular outcome study (ELIXA) enrolled 6,068 
type 2 diabetes patients with previous acute coronary syndrome (3,034 randomised to lixisenatide, 
including 198 patients ≥75 years of age and 655 patients with moderate renal impairment). 
In the completed Phase III studies, it was observed that approximately 90% of the patients were able to 
remain on the once daily maintenance dose of 20 mcg Lyxumia at the end of the main 24-week 
treatment period. 
•  Glycaemic control 
Add-on combination therapy with oral antidiabetics 
Lyxumia in combination with metformin, a sulphonylurea, pioglitazone or a combination of these 
agents showed statistically significant reductions in HbA1c, in fasting plasma glucose and in 2-hour 
post-prandial glucose after a test-meal compared to placebo at the end of the main 24-week treatment 
period (tables 2 and 3). The HbA1c reduction was significant with once-daily administration, whether 
administered morning or evening. 
This effect on HbA1c was sustained in long term studies for up to 76 weeks.

In an active-controlled study, Lyxumia once daily showed an HbA1c reduction of -0.79% compared 
to -0.96% with exenatide twice daily at the end of the main 24-week treatment period with a mean 
treatment difference of 0.17% (95% CI: 0.033, 0.297) and a similar percentage of patients achieved an 
HbA1c less than 7% in the lixisenatide group (48.5%) and in the exenatide group (49.8%).   
The incidence of nausea was 24.5% in the lixisenatide group compared to 35.1% in the exenatide 
twice daily group and the incidence of symptomatic hypoglycaemia with lixisenatide was 2.5% during 
the 24-week main treatment period compared to 7.9% in the exenatide group.  
In a 24-week open-label study, lixisenatide administered before the main meal of the day was 
non-inferior to lixisenatide administered before breakfast in terms of HbA1c reduction (LS mean 
change from baseline: -0.65% versus -0.74%). Similar HbA1c decreases were observed regardless of 
which meal was the main meal (breakfast, lunch or dinner). At the end of the study, 43.6% (main meal 
group) and 42.8% (breakfast group) of patients achieved an HbA1c less than 7%. Nausea was reported 
in 14.7% and 15.5% of patients, and symptomatic hypoglycaemia in 5.8% and 2.2% of patients, main 
meal group and breakfast group, respectively.

Add-on treatment to pioglitazone alone or in combination with metformin 
In a clinical study, the addition of lixisenatide to pioglitazone with or without metformin, in patients 
not adequately controlled with pioglitazone, resulted in an HbA1c decrease from baseline of 0.90%, 
compared to a decrease from baseline of 0.34% in the placebo group at the end of the 24-week main 
treatment period. At the end of the 24-week main treatment period, 52.3% of the lixisenatide patients 
achieved an HbA1c less than 7% compared to 26.4% in the placebo group.  
During the 24-week main treatment period, nausea was reported in 23.5% in the lixisenatide group 
compared to 10.6% in the placebo group and symptomatic hypoglycaemia was reported in 3.4% of the 
lixisenatide patients compared to 1.2% in the placebo group.  
Add-on combination therapy with a basal insulin 
Lyxumia given with a basal insulin alone, or with a combination of a basal insulin and metformin, or a 
combination of a basal insulin and a sulphonylurea resulted in statistically significant reductions in 
HbA1c and in 2-hour post-prandial glucose after a test-meal compared to placebo.

*performed in Asian population 
A clinical study was conducted in insulin-naive patients insufficiently controlled on oral antidiabetic 
agents. This study consisted of a 12-week run-in period with introduction and titration of insulin 
glargine and of a 24-week treatment period during which patients receive either lixisenatide or placebo 
in combination with insulin glargine and metformin with or without thiazolidinediones. Insulin 
glargine was continuously titrated during this period. 
During the 12-week run-in period, addition and titration of insulin glargine resulted approximately in 
an HbA1c decrease of 1%. The addition of lixisenatide led to a significantly greater HbA1c decrease of 
0.71% in the lixisenatide group compared to 0.40% in the placebo group. At the end of the 24-week 
treatment period, 56.3% of the lixisenatide patients achieved an HbA1c less than 7 % compared to 
38.5% in the placebo group. 
During the 24-week treatment period, 22.4% lixisenatide patients reported at least one symptomatic 
hypoglycaemic event compared to 13.5% in the placebo group. The incidence of hypoglycaemia was 
mainly increased in the lixisenatide group during the first 6 weeks of treatment and thereafter, was 
similar to the placebo group. 
Patients with type 2 diabetes with basal insulin combined with 1-3 oral anti-diabetic agents were 
enrolled in an open-label randomised study for insulin intensification. After 12-week of optimal 
insulin glargine titration with or without metformin, inadequately controlled patients were randomised 
to add single dose of lixisenatide or a single dose (QD) of insulin glulisine (both before the largest 
meal) or insulin glulisine administered three times a day (TID) for 26 weeks. 
The level of HbA1c reduction was comparable between groups (table 5). 
As opposed to both insulin glulisine treatment regimens, lixisenatide reduced body weight (table 5).

•  Fasting plasma glucose 
The reductions in fasting plasma glucose obtained with Lyxumia treatment ranged from 0.42 mmol/L 
to 1.19 mmol/L (7.6 to 21.4 mg/dl) from baseline at the end of the main 24-week treatment period in 
placebo-controlled studies. 
•  Post-prandial glucose 
Treatment with Lyxumia resulted in reductions in 2-hour post-prandial glucose after a test-meal 
statistically superior to placebo whatever the background treatment.  
The reductions with Lyxumia ranged from 4.51 to 7.96 mmol/L (81.2 to 143.3 mg/dl) from baseline at 
the end of the main 24-week treatment period across all studies in which post-prandial glucose was 
measured; 26.2% to 46.8% of patients had a 2-hour post-prandial glucose value below 7.8 mmol/L 
(140.4 mg/dl). 
•  Body weight  
Treatment with Lyxumia in combination with metformin and/or a sulphonylurea resulted in a 
sustained body weight change from baseline in all controlled studies in a range from -1.76 kg to -
2.96 kg at the end of the main 24-week treatment period.  
Body weight change from baseline in a range from -0.38 kg to -1.80 kg was also observed in 
lixisenatide patients receiving stable basal insulin dose, alone or in combination with metformin or a 
sulphonylurea. 
In patients newly started on insulin, body weight remained almost unchanged in the lixisenatide group 
while an increase was shown in the placebo group.  
Body weight reduction was sustained in long term studies up to 76 weeks. 
The body weight reduction is independent from the occurrence of nausea and vomiting. 
•  Beta cell function 
Clinical studies with Lyxumia indicate improved beta-cell function as measured by the homeostasis 
model assessment for beta-cell function (HOMA-β). 
Restoration of first phase insulin secretion and improved second phase insulin secretion in response to 
an intravenous bolus of glucose were demonstrated in patients with type 2 diabetes (n=20) after a 
single dose of Lyxumia.

•  Cardiovascular evaluation 
No increase in mean heart rate in patients with type 2 diabetes was seen in all placebo controlled phase 
III studies. 
Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure reductions up to 2.1 mmHg and up to 1.5 mmHg 
respectively were observed in phase III placebo-controlled studies. 
The ELIXA study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational study that 
evaluated cardiovascular (CV) outcomes during treatment with lixisenatide in patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus after a recent Acute Coronary Syndrome. 
Overall, 6068 patients were randomized 1:1 to either placebo or lixisenatide 20 mcg (following a 
starting dose of 10 mcg during the first 2 weeks). 
Ninety-six percent of the patients in both treatment groups completed the study in accordance with the 
protocol and the vital status was known at the end of the study for 99.0% and 98.6% of the patients in 
the lixisenatide and placebo group, respectively. Median treatment duration was 22.4 months in the 
lixisenatide group and 23.3 months in the placebo group, and the median duration of study follow-up 
was 25.8 and 25.7 months, respectively. Mean HbA1c (±SD) in the lixisenatide and placebo groups 
was 7.72 (±1.32) % and 7.64 (±1.28) % at baseline and 7.46 (±1.51) % and 7.61 (±1.48) % at 24 
months, respectively.

Elderly 
People aged ≥70 years 
The efficacy and safety of lixisenatide in people aged ≥70 years with type 2 diabetes was evaluated in 
a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 24 weeks duration. Frail patients, including patients at risk 
for malnutrition, patients with recent cardiovascular events and patients with moderate to severe 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cognitive impairment were excluded. A total of 350 patients were randomized (randomization ratio 
1:1). Overall, 37% of the patients were ≥75 years old (N=131) and 31% had moderate renal 
impairment (N=107). Patients received stable dose(s) of oral antidiabetic drug(s) (OAD) and/or basal 
insulin as background therapy. Sulfonylureas or glinides were not used with basal insulin as 
background therapy. 
Lixisenatide provided significant improvements in HbA1c (-0.64% change compared to placebo; 95% 
CI: -0.810% to -0.464%; p<0.0001), from a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.0%. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Lyxumia in all subsets of the paediatric population in type 2 diabetes mellitus (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
Absorption 
Following subcutaneous administration to patients with type 2 diabetes, the rate of lixisenatide 
absorption is rapid and not influenced by the dose administered. Irrespective of the dose and whether 
lixisenatide was administered as single or multiple doses, the median tmax is 1 to 3.5 hours in patients 
with type 2 diabetes. There are no clinically relevant differences in the rate of absorption when 
lixisenatide is administered subcutaneously in the abdomen, thigh, or arm. 
Distribution 
Lixisenatide has a moderate level of binding (55%) to human proteins. 
The apparent volume of distribution after subcutaneous administration of lixisenatide (Vz/F) is 
approximately 100 L. 
Biotransformation and elimination 
As a peptide, lixisenatide is eliminated through glomerular filtration, followed by tubular reabsorption 
and subsequent metabolic degradation, resulting in smaller peptides and amino acids, which are 
reintroduced in the protein metabolism. 
After multiple dose administration in patients with type 2 diabetes, mean terminal half-life was 
approximately 3 hours and the mean apparent clearance (CL/F) about 35 L/h. 
Special populations 
Patients with renal impairment 
In subjects with mild (creatinine clearance calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault formula 60-90 ml/min), 
moderate (creatinine clearance 30-60 ml/min) and severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 
15-30 ml/min), AUC was increased by 46%, 51% and 87%, respectively. 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
As lixisenatide is cleared primarily by the kidney, no pharmacokinetic study has been performed in 
patients with acute or chronic hepatic impairment. Hepatic dysfunction is not expected to affect the 
pharmacokinetics of lixisenatide.  
Gender 
Gender has no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of lixisenatide. 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Race 
Ethnic origin had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of lixisenatide based on the 
results of pharmacokinetic studies in Caucasian, Japanese and Chinese subjects.  
Elderly 
Age has no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of lixisenatide. In a pharmacokinetic 
study in elderly non-diabetic subjects, administration of lixisenatide 20 mcg resulted in a mean 
increase of lixisenatide AUC by 29% in the elderly population (11 subjects aged 65 to 74 years and 7 
subjects aged ≥75 years) compared to 18 subjects aged 18 to 45 years, likely related to reduced renal 
function in the older age group. 
Body weight 
Body weight has no clinically relevant effect on lixisenatide AUC.  
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazards for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology and toxicology. 
In 2-year subcutaneous carcinogenicity studies, non-lethal C-cell thyroid tumours were seen in rats 
and mice and are considered to be caused by a non-genotoxic GLP-1 receptor-mediated mechanism to 
which rodents are particularly sensitive. C-cell hyperplasia and adenoma were seen at all doses in rats 
and a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) could be not defined. In mice, these effects occurred 
at exposure ratio above 9.3-fold when compared to human exposure at the therapeutic dose. No C-cell 
carcinoma was observed in mice and C-cell carcinoma occurred in rats with an exposure ratio relative 
to exposure at human therapeutic dose of about 900-fold. In 2-year subcutaneous carcinogenicity study 
in mice, 3 cases of adenocarcinoma in the endometrium were seen in the mid dose group with a 
statistically significant increase, corresponding to an exposure ratio of 97-fold. No treatment-related 
effect was demonstrated. 
Animal studies did not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to male and female fertility in rats. 
Reversible testicular and epididymal lesions were seen in dogs treated with lixisenatide. No related 
effect on spermatogenesis was seen in healthy men. 
In embryo-foetal development studies, malformations, growth retardation, ossification retardation and 
skeletal effects were observed in rats at all doses (5-fold exposure ratio compared to human exposure) 
and in rabbits at high doses (32-fold exposure ratio compared to human exposure) of lixisenatide. In 
both species, there was a slight maternal toxicity consisting of low food consumption and reduced 
body weight. Neonatal growth was reduced in male rats exposed to high doses of lixisenatide during 
late gestation and lactation, with a slightly increased pup mortality observed.

4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications  
Lyxumia is indicated for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus to achieve glycaemic 
control in combination with oral glucose-lowering medicinal products and/or basal insulin when these, 
together, with diet and exercise, do not provide adequate glycaemic control (see sections 4.4 and 5.1 
for available data on the different combinations). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration  
Posology 
Starting dose: dosing is initiated at 10 mcg lixisenatide once daily for 14 days. 
Maintenance dose: a fixed maintenance dose of 20 mcg lixisenatide once daily is started on Day 15.   
When Lyxumia is added to existing metformin therapy, the current metformin dose can be continued 
unchanged. 
When Lyxumia is added to existing therapy of a sulphonylurea or a basal insulin, a reduction in the 
dose of the sulphonylurea or the basal insulin may be considered to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. 
Lyxumia should not be given in combination with basal insulin and a sulphonylurea due to increased 
risk of hypoglycaemia (see section 4.4). 
The use of Lyxumia does not require specific blood glucose monitoring. However, when used in 
combination with a sulphonylurea or a basal insulin, blood glucose monitoring or blood glucose self- 
monitoring may become necessary to adjust the doses of the sulphonylurea or the basal insulin. 
Special populations 
Elderly  
No dose adjustment is required based on age. 
Patients with renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.  
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There is no therapeutic experience in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less 
than 30 ml/min) or end-stage renal disease and therefore, it is not recommended to use lixisenatide in 
these populations (see section 5.2). 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is needed in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of lixisenatide in children and adolescents less than 18 years of age have not 
been established (see section 5.1). No data are available. 
Method of administration  
Lyxumia is to be injected subcutaneously in the thigh, abdomen or upper arm. Lyxumia should not be 
administered intravenously or intramuscularly. 
The injection is administered once daily, within the hour prior to any meal of the day. It is preferable 
that the prandial injection of Lyxumia is performed before the same meal every day, when the most 
convenient meal has been chosen. If a dose is missed, it should be injected within the hour prior to the 
next meal. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
There is no therapeutic experience with lixisenatide in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and it 
should not be used in these patients. Lixisenatide should not be used for treatment of diabetic 
ketoacidosis. 
Acute pancreatitis  
Use of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists has been associated with a risk of 
developing acute pancreatitis. There have been few reported events of acute pancreatitis with 
lixisenatide although a causal relationship has not been established. Patients should be informed of the 
characteristic symptoms of acute pancreatitis: persistent, severe abdominal pain. If pancreatitis is 
suspected, lixisenatide should be discontinued; if acute pancreatitis is confirmed, lixisenatide should 
not be restarted. Caution should be exercised in patients with a history of pancreatitis. 
Severe gastrointestinal disease 
Use of GLP-1 receptor agonists may be associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions. Lixisenatide 
has not been studied in patients with severe gastrointestinal disease, including severe gastroparesis and 
therefore, the use of lixisenatide is not recommended in these patients. 
Renal impairment 
There is no therapeutic experience in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less 
than 30 ml/min) or end-stage renal disease. Use is not recommended in patients with severe renal 
impairment or end-stage renal disease (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Hypoglycaemia 
Patients receiving Lyxumia with a sulphonylurea or with a basal insulin may have an increased risk of 
hypoglycaemia. Reduction of the dose of the sulphonylurea or the basal insulin may be considered to 
reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia (see section 4.2). Lixisenatide should not be given in combination 
with basal insulin and a sulphonylurea due to increased risk of hypoglycaemia. 
Concomitant medicinal products 
The delay of gastric emptying with lixisenatide may reduce the rate of absorption of orally 
administered medicinal products. Lixisenatide should be used with caution in patients receiving oral 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
medicinal products that require rapid gastrointestinal absorption, require careful clinical monitoring or 
have a narrow therapeutic ratio. Specific recommendations regarding intake of such medicinal 
products are given in section 4.5. 
Populations not studied 
Lixisenatide has not been studied in combination with dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. 
Dehydration 
Patients treated with lixisenatide should be advised of the potential risk of dehydration in relation to 
gastrointestinal adverse reactions and take precautions to avoid fluid depletion.

This medicinal product contains metacresol, which may cause allergic reactions. 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e., essentially 
“sodium-free”. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
Lixisenatide is a peptide and is not metabolised by cytochrome P450. In in vitro studies, lixisenatide 
did not affect the activity of cytochrome P450 isozymes or human transporters tested. 
The delay of gastric emptying with lixisenatide may reduce the rate of absorption of orally 
administered medicinal products. Patients receiving medicinal products of either a narrow therapeutic 
ratio or medicinal products that require careful clinical monitoring should be followed closely, 
especially at the time of initiation of lixisenatide treatment. These medicinal products should be taken 
in a standardised way in relation to lixisenatide. If such medicinal products are to be administered with 
food, patients should be advised to, if possible, take them with a meal when lixisenatide is not 
administered. 
For oral medicinal products that are particularly dependent on threshold concentrations for efficacy, 
such as antibiotics, patients should be advised to take those medicinal products at least 1 hour before 
or 4 hours after lixisenatide injection. 
Gastro-resistant formulations containing substances sensitive to stomach degradation, should be 
administered 1 hour before or 4 hours after lixisenatide injection. 
Paracetamol 
Paracetamol was used as a model medicinal product to evaluate the effect of lixisenatide on gastric 
emptying. Following administration of a single dose of paracetamol 1,000 mg, paracetamol AUC and 
t1/2 were unchanged whatever the timing of its administration (before or after the lixisenatide 
injection). When administered 1 or 4 hours after 10 mcg lixisenatide, Cmax of paracetamol was 
decreased by 29% and 31% respectively and median tmax was delayed by 2.0 and 1.75 hours 
respectively. A further delay in tmax and a reduced Cmax of paracetamol have been predicted with the 
20 mcg maintenance dose. No effects on paracetamol Cmax and tmax were observed when paracetamol 
was administered 1 hour before lixisenatide. 
Based on these results, no dose adjustment for paracetamol is required but the delayed tmax observed 
when paracetamol is administered 1-4 hours after lixisenatide should be taken into account when a 
rapid onset of action is required for efficacy. 
Oral contraceptives 
Following administration of a single dose of an oral contraceptive medicinal product (ethinylestradiol 
0.03 mg/levonorgestrel 0.15 mg) 1 hour before or 11 hours after 10 mcg lixisenatide, the Cmax, AUC, 
t1/2 and tmax of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel were unchanged. 
Administration of the oral contraceptive 1 hour before or 4 hours after lixisenatide did not affect AUC 
and t1/2 of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel, whereas Cmax of ethinylestradiol was decreased by 52% 
and 39% respectively and Cmax of levonorgestrel was decreased by 46% and 20%, respectively and 
median tmax was delayed by 1 to 3 hours. 
The reduction in Cmax is of limited clinical relevance and no dose adjustment for oral contraceptives is 
required.  
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Atorvastatin 
When lixisenatide 20 mcg and atorvastatin 40 mg were co-administered in the morning for 6 days, the 
exposure to atorvastatin was not affected, while Cmax was decreased by 31% and tmax was delayed by 
3.25 hours. 
No such increase for tmax was observed when atorvastatin was administered in the evening and 
lixisenatide in the morning but the AUC and Cmax of atorvastatin were increased by 27% and 66%, 
respectively. 
These changes are not clinically relevant and therefore, no dose adjustment for atorvastatin is required 
when co-administered with lixisenatide. 
Warfarin and other coumarin derivatives 
After concomitant administration of warfarin 25 mg with repeated dosing of lixisenatide 20 mcg, there 
were no effects on AUC or INR (International Normalised Ratio) while Cmax was reduced by 19% and 
tmax was delayed by 7 hours. 
Based on these results, no dose adjustment for warfarin is required when co-administered with 
lixisenatide; however, frequent monitoring of INR in patients on warfarin and/or coumarin derivatives 
is recommended at the time of initiation or ending of lixisenatide treatment. 
Digoxin 
After concomitant administration of lixisenatide 20 mcg and digoxin 0.25 mg at steady state, the AUC 
of digoxin was not affected. The tmax of digoxin was delayed by 1.5 hour and the Cmax was reduced by 
26%.  
Based on these results, no dose adjustment for digoxin is required when co-administered with 
lixisenatide. 
Ramipril 
After concomitant administration of lixisenatide 20 mcg and ramipril 5 mg during 6 days, the AUC of 
ramipril was increased by 21% while the Cmax was decreased by 63%. The AUC and Cmax of the active 
metabolite (ramiprilat) were not affected. The tmax of ramipril and ramiprilat were delayed by 
approximately 2.5 hours. 
Based on these results, no dose adjustment for ramipril is required when co-administered with 
lixisenatide. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Women of childbearing potential 
Lyxumia is not recommended in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. 
Pregnancy 
There are no adequate data from the use of Lyxumia in pregnant women. Studies in animals have 
shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Lyxumia 
should not be used during pregnancy. The use of insulin is recommended instead. If a patient wishes to 
become pregnant, or pregnancy occurs, treatment with Lyxumia should be discontinued.  
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown if Lyxumia is excreted in human milk. Lyxumia should not be used during 
breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
Animal studies do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Lixisenatide has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines. When used in 
combination with a sulphonylurea or a basal insulin, patients should be advised to take precautions to 
avoid hypoglycaemia while driving and using machines.

4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile  
Over 2,600 patients have received Lyxumia either alone or in combination with metformin, a 
sulphonylurea (with or without metformin) or a basal insulin (with or without metformin, or with or 
without a sulphonylurea) in 8 large placebo- or active-controlled phase III studies.  
The most frequently reported adverse reactions during clinical studies were nausea, vomiting and 
diarrhoea. These reactions were mostly mild and transient.  
In addition, hypoglycaemia (when Lyxumia was used in combination with a sulphonylurea and/or a 
basal insulin) and headache occurred.  
Allergic reactions have been reported in 0.4% of Lyxumia patients.  
Tabulated list of adverse reactions  
Adverse reactions reported from placebo- and active-controlled phase III studies over the entire 
treatment period are presented in Table 1. The table presents adverse reactions that occurred with an 
incidence >5% if the frequency was higher among Lyxumia treated patients than patients treated with 
all comparators. The table also includes adverse reactions with a frequency ≥1% in the Lyxumia group 
if the frequency was greater than 2 times the frequency for all comparators group.  
Frequencies of adverse reactions are defined as: very common: ≥1/10; common: ≥1/100 to <1/10; 
uncommon: ≥1/1,000 to <1/100; rare: ≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000; very rare: <1/10,000). 
Within each system organ class, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing frequency.

Description of selected adverse reactions  
Hypoglycaemia  
In patients taking Lyxumia in monotherapy, symptomatic hypoglycaemia occurred in 1.7% of 
lixisenatide treated patients and in 1.6% of placebo treated patients. When Lyxumia is used in 
combination with metformin alone, symptomatic hypoglycaemia occurred in 7.0% of lixisenatide 
patients and in 4.8% of placebo patients during the entire treatment period. 
In patients taking Lyxumia in combination with a sulphonylurea and metformin, symptomatic 
hypoglycaemia occurred in 22.0% of lixisenatide treated patients and in 18.4% of placebo treated 
patients during the entire treatment period (3.6% absolute difference). When Lyxumia is used in 
combination with a basal insulin with or without metformin, symptomatic hypoglycaemia occurred in 
42.1% of lixisenatide patients and in 38.9% of placebo patients during the entire treatment period 
(3.2% absolute difference). 
During the entire treatment period, when Lyxumia was given with a sulphonylurea alone, symptomatic 
hypoglycaemia occurred in 22.7% of lixisenatide treated patients versus 15.2% with placebo (7.5% 
absolute difference). When Lyxumia was given with a sulphonylurea and a basal insulin, symptomatic

hypoglycaemia occurred in 47.2% of lixisenatide treated patients compared to 21.6% with placebo 
(25.6% absolute difference). 
Overall, the incidence of severe symptomatic hypoglycaemia was uncommon (0.4% in lixisenatide 
patients and 0.2% in placebo patients) during the entire treatment period of the Phase III placebo-
controlled studies. 
Gastrointestinal disorders  
Nausea and vomiting were the most frequently reported adverse reactions during the main 24-week 
treatment period. The incidence of nausea was higher in the lixisenatide group (26.1%) compared to 
the placebo group (6.2%) and the incidence of vomiting was higher in the lixisenatide group (10.5%) 
than in the placebo group (1.8%). They were mostly mild and transient and occurred during the first 3 
weeks after starting treatment. Thereafter, they progressively decreased during the following weeks.  
Injection site reactions  
Injections site reactions were reported in 3.9% of the patients receiving Lyxumia while they were 
reported in 1.4% of patients receiving placebo during the main 24-week treatment period. The 
majority of reactions were mild in intensity and usually did not result in discontinuation of the 
treatment.  
Immunogenicity  
Consistent with the potentially immunogenic properties of medicinal products containing proteins or 
peptides, patients may develop anti-lixisenatide antibodies following treatment with Lyxumia and, at 
the end of the main 24-week treatment period in placebo-controlled studies, 69.8% of lixisenatide 
patients had a positive antibody status. The percentage of patients who were antibody positive was 
similar at the end of the entire 76-week treatment period. At the end of the main 24-week treatment 
period, 32.2% of the patients having a positive antibody status had an antibody concentration above 
the lower limit of quantification, and at the end of the entire 76-week treatment period, 44.7% of the 
patients had an antibody concentration above the lower limit of quantification. After stopping the 
treatment, few antibody positive patients were followed up for antibody status; the percentage 
decreased to approximately 90% within 3 months and 30% at 6 months or beyond. 
The change in HbA1c from baseline was similar regardless of the antibody status (positive or negative). 
Of lixisenatide-treated patients with HbA1c measurement, 79.3% had either a negative antibody status 
or an antibody concentration below the lower limit of quantification and the other 20.7% of patients 
had a quantified antibody concentration. In the subset of patients (5.2%) with the highest antibody 
concentrations, the mean improvement in HbA1c at Week 24 and at Week 76 was in a clinically 
relevant range; however, there was variability in the glycaemic response and 1.9% had no decrease in 
HbA1c. 
The antibody status (positive or negative) is not predictive of the reduction of HbA1c for an individual 
patient. 
There was no difference in the overall safety profile in patients regardless of the antibody status with 
the exception of an increase of the incidence of injection site reactions (4.7%in antibody positive 
patients compared to 2.5% in antibody negative patients during the entire treatment period). The 
majority of injection site reactions were mild, regardless of antibody status. 
There was no cross-reactivity versus either native glucagon or endogenous GLP-1. 
Allergic reactions 
Allergic reactions possibly associated with lixisenatide (such as anaphylactic reaction, angioedema 
and urticaria) have been reported in 0.4% of lixisenatide patients while possibly associated allergic 
reactions occurred in less than 0.1% of placebo patients during the main 24-week treatment period. 
Anaphylactic reactions were reported in 0.2% of the lixisenatide treated patients vs. none in the 
placebo group. Most of these reported allergic reactions were mild in severity. 
One case of anaphylactoid reaction was reported during clinical trials with lixisenatide. 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Heart rate 
In a study in healthy volunteers, a transient rise in heart rate has been observed after administration of 
lixisenatide 20 mcg. Cardiac arrhythmias particularly tachycardia (0.8% vs <0.1%) and palpitations 
(1.5% vs 0.8%) have been reported in lixisenatide patients compared to placebo treated patients. 
Withdrawal  
The incidence of treatment discontinuation due to adverse events was 7.4% for Lyxumia compared to 
3.2% in the placebo group during the main 24-week treatment period. The most common adverse 
reactions which led to treatment discontinuation in the lixisenatide group were nausea (3.1%) and 
vomiting (1.2%).  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.  
4.9  Overdose  
During clinical studies, doses up to 30 mcg of lixisenatide twice a day were administered to type 2 
diabetic patients in a 13 week study. An increased incidence of gastrointestinal disorders was 
observed.  
In case of overdose, appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated according to the patient’s 
clinical signs and symptoms and the lixisenatide dose should be reduced to the prescribed dose.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in Diabetes, Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues, 
ATC code: A10BJ03.  
Mechanism of action 
Lixisenatide is a selective GLP-1 receptor agonist. The GLP-1 receptor is the target for native GLP-1, 
an endogenous incretin hormone that potentiates glucose-dependent insulin secretion from the 
pancreatic beta cells. 
Lixisenatide action is mediated via a specific interaction with GLP-1 receptors, leading to an increase 
in intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Lixisenatide stimulates insulin secretion 
when blood glucose is increased but not at normoglycaemia, which limits the risk of hypoglycaemia. 
In parallel, glucagon secretion is suppressed. In case of hypoglycaemia, the rescue mechanism of 
glucagon secretion is preserved. 
Lixisenatide slows gastric emptying thereby reducing the rate at which meal-derived glucose appears 
in the circulation. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
When administered once daily, lixisenatide improves glycaemic control through the immediate and 
sustained effects of lowering both post-prandial and fasting glucose concentrations in patients with 
type 2 diabetes. 
This effect on post-prandial glucose was confirmed in a 4-week study versus liraglutide 1.8 mg once a 
day in combination with metformin. Reduction from baseline in the AUC0:30-4:30 h of plasma glucose 
after a test meal was: -12.61 h*mmol/L (-227.25 h*mg/dl) in the lixisenatide group 
and -4.04 h*mmol/L (-72.83 h*mg/dl) in the liraglutide group. This was also confirmed in an 8-week 
study versus liraglutide, administered before breakfast, in combination with insulin glargine with or 
without metformin. 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The clinical efficacy and safety of Lyxumia were evaluated in nine randomised double-blind, 
placebo-controlled clinical studies including 4,508 patients with type 2 diabetes (2,869 patients 
randomised to lixisenatide, 47.5% men and 52.5% women, and 517 were ≥65 years of age). 
Efficacy of Lyxumia was also assessed in two randomised, open-label, active-controlled study (versus 
exenatide or versus insulin glulisine) and in a mealtime study (in total 1,067 patients randomised to 
lixisenatide). 
Efficacy and safety of Lyxumia in patients older than 70 years was addressed in a specifically 
dedicated placebo-controlled study (176 patients randomised to lixisenatide, including 62 patients ≥75 
years of age). 
In addition, a double-blind, placebo-controlled cardiovascular outcome study (ELIXA) enrolled 6,068 
type 2 diabetes patients with previous acute coronary syndrome (3,034 randomised to lixisenatide, 
including 198 patients ≥75 years of age and 655 patients with moderate renal impairment). 
In the completed Phase III studies, it was observed that approximately 90% of the patients were able to 
remain on the once daily maintenance dose of 20 mcg Lyxumia at the end of the main 24-week 
treatment period. 
•  Glycaemic control 
Add-on combination therapy with oral antidiabetics 
Lyxumia in combination with metformin, a sulphonylurea, pioglitazone or a combination of these 
agents showed statistically significant reductions in HbA1c, in fasting plasma glucose and in 2-hour 
post-prandial glucose after a test-meal compared to placebo at the end of the main 24-week treatment 
period (tables 2 and 3). The HbA1c reduction was significant with once daily administration, whether 
administered morning or evening. 
This effect on HbA1c was sustained in long term studies for up to 76 weeks.

In an active-controlled study, Lyxumia once daily showed an HbA1c reduction of -0.79% compared to 
-0.96% with exenatide twice daily at the end of the main 24-week treatment period with a mean 
treatment difference of 0.17% (95%CI: 0.033, 0.297) and a similar percentage of patients achieved an 
HbA1c less than 7% in the lixisenatide group (48.5%) and in the exenatide group (49.8%).

The incidence of nausea was 24.5% in the lixisenatide group compared to 35.1% in the exenatide 
twice daily group and the incidence of symptomatic hypoglycaemia with lixisenatide was 2.5% during 
the 24-week main treatment period compared to 7.9% in the exenatide group.  
In a 24-week open-label study, lixisenatide administered before the main meal of the day was 
non-inferior to lixisenatide administered before breakfast in terms of HbA1c reduction (LS mean 
change from baseline: -0.65% versus -0.74%). Similar HbA1c decreases were observed regardless of 
which meal was the main meal (breakfast, lunch or dinner). At the end of the study, 43.6% (main meal 
group) and 42.8% (breakfast group) of patients achieved an HbA1c less than 7%. Nausea was reported 
in 14.7% and 15.5% of patients, and symptomatic hypoglycaemia in 5.8% and 2.2% of patients, main 
meal group and breakfast group, respectively.

Add-on treatment to pioglitazone alone or in combination with metformin 
In a clinical study, the addition of lixisenatide to pioglitazone with or without metformin, in patients 
not adequately controlled with pioglitazone, resulted in an HbA1c decrease from baseline of 0.90%, 
compared to a decrease from baseline of 0.34% in the placebo group at the end of the 24-week main 
treatment period. At the end of the 24-week main treatment period, 52.3% of the lixisenatide patients 
achieved an HbA1c less than 7% compared to 26.4% in the placebo group.  
During the 24-week main treatment period, nausea was reported in 23.5% in the lixisenatide group 
compared to 10.6% in the placebo group and symptomatic hypoglycaemia was reported in 3.4% of the 
lixisenatide patients compared to 1.2% in the placebo group.  
Add-on combination therapy with a basal insulin 
Lyxumia given with a basal insulin alone, or with a combination of a basal insulin and metformin, or a 
combination of a basal insulin and a sulphonylurea resulted in statistically significant reductions in 
HbA1c and in 2-hour post-prandial glucose after a test- meal compared to placebo.

*performed in Asian population 
A clinical study was conducted in insulin-naive patients insufficiently controlled on oral antidiabetic 
agents. This study consisted of a 12-week run-in period with introduction and titration of insulin 
glargine and of a 24-week treatment period during which patients receive either lixisenatide or placebo 
in combination with insulin glargine and metformin with or without thiazolidinediones. Insulin 
glargine was continuously titrated during this period. 
During the 12-week run-in period, addition and titration of insulin glargine resulted approximately in 
an HbA1c decrease of 1%. The addition of lixisenatide led to a significantly greater HbA1c decrease of 
0.71% in the lixisenatide group compared to 0.40% in the placebo group. At the end of the 24-week 
treatment period, 56.3% of the lixisenatide patients achieved an HbA1c less than 7 % compared to 
38.5% in the placebo group. 
During the 24-week treatment period, 22.4% lixisenatide patients reported at least one symptomatic 
hypoglycaemic event compared to 13.5% in the placebo group. The incidence of hypoglycaemia was 
mainly increased in the lixisenatide group during the first 6 weeks of treatment and thereafter, was 
similar to the placebo group. 
Patients with type 2 diabetes with basal insulin combined with 1-3 oral anti-diabetic agents were 
enrolled in an open-label randomised study for insulin intensification. After 12-week of optimal 
insulin glargine titration with or without metformin, inadequately controlled patients were randomised 
to add single dose of lixisenatide or a single dose (QD) of insulin glulisine (both before the largest 
meal) or insulin glulisine administered three times a day (TID) for 26 weeks. 
The level of HbA1c reduction was comparable between groups (table 5). 
As opposed to both insulin glulisine treatment regimens, lixisenatide reduced body weight (table 5).

•  Fasting plasma glucose 
The reductions in fasting plasma glucose obtained with Lyxumia treatment ranged from 0.42 mmol/L 
to 1.19 mmol/L (7.6 to 21.4 mg/dl) from baseline at the end of the main 24-week treatment period in 
placebo-controlled studies. 
•  Post-prandial glucose 
Treatment with Lyxumia resulted in reductions in 2-hour post-prandial glucose after a test-meal 
statistically superior to placebo whatever the background treatment. 
The reductions with Lyxumia ranged from 4.51 to 7.96 mmol/L (81.2 to 143.3 mg/dl) from baseline at 
the end of the main 24-week treatment period across all studies in which post-prandial glucose was 
measured; 26.2% to 46.8% of patients had a 2-hour post-prandial glucose value below 7.8 mmol/L 
(140.4 mg/dl). 
•  Body weight  
Treatment with Lyxumia in combination with metformin and/or a sulphonylurea resulted in a 
sustained body weight change from baseline in all controlled studies in a range from - 1.76 kg to - 
2.96 kg at the end of the main 24-weeks treatment period. 
Body weight change from baseline in a range from - 0.38 kg to - 1.80 kg was also observed in 
lixisenatide patients receiving stable basal insulin dose alone or in combination with metformin or a 
sulphonylurea. 
In patients newly started on insulin, body weight remained almost unchanged in the lixisenatide group 
while an increase was shown in the placebo group. 
Body weight reduction was sustained in long term studies up to 76 weeks. 
The body weight reduction is independent from the occurrence of nausea and vomiting. 
•  Beta cell function 
Clinical studies with Lyxumia indicate improved beta-cell function as measured by the homeostasis 
model assessment for beta-cell function (HOMA-β). 
Restoration of first phase insulin secretion and improved second phase insulin secretion in response to 
an intravenous bolus of glucose were demonstrated in patients with type 2 diabetes (n=20) after a 
single dose of Lyxumia.

•  Cardiovascular evaluation 
No increase in mean heart rate patients with type 2 diabetes was seen in all placebo controlled phase 
III studies. 
Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure reductions up to 2.1 mmHg and up to 1.5 mmHg 
respectively were observed in phase III placebo-controlled studies. 
The ELIXA study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational study that 
evaluated cardiovascular (CV) outcomes during treatment with lixisenatide in patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus after a recent Acute Coronary Syndrome. 
Overall, 6068 patients were randomized 1:1 to either placebo or lixisenatide 20 mcg (following a 
starting dose of 10 mcg during the first 2 weeks). 
Ninety-six percent of the patients in both treatment groups completed the study in accordance with the 
protocol and the vital status was known at the end of the study for 99.0% and 98.6% of the patients in 
the lixisenatide and placebo group, respectively. Median treatment duration was 22.4 months in the 
lixisenatide group and 23.3 months in the placebo group, and the median duration of study follow-up 
was 25.8 and 25.7 months, respectively. Mean HbA1c (±SD) in the lixisenatide and placebo groups 
was 7.72 (±1.32) % and 7.64 (±1.28) % at baseline and 7.46 (±1.51) % and 7.61 (±1.48) % at 24 
months, respectively. 
The results of the primary and secondary composite efficacy endpoints and the results of all the 
individual components of the composite endpoints are shown in Figure 1.

Elderly 
People aged ≥70 years 
The efficacy and safety of lixisenatide in people aged ≥70 years with type 2 diabetes was evaluated in 
a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 24 weeks duration. Frail patients, including patients at risk 
for malnutrition, patients with recent cardiovascular events and patients with moderate to severe 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cognitive impairment were excluded. A total of 350 patients were randomized (randomization ratio 
1:1). Overall, 37% of the patients were ≥75 years old (N=131) and 31% had moderate renal 
impairment (N=107). Patients received stable dose(s) of oral antidiabetic drug(s) (OAD) and/or basal 
insulin as background therapy. Sulfonylureas or glinides were not used with basal insulin as 
background therapy. 
Lixisenatide provided significant improvements in HbA1c (-0.64% change compared to placebo; 95% 
CI: -0.810% to -0.464%; p<0.0001), from a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.0%. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Lyxumia in all subsets of the paediatric population in type 2 diabetes mellitus (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
Absorption 
Following subcutaneous administration to patients with type 2 diabetes, the rate of lixisenatide 
absorption is rapid and not influenced by the dose administered. Irrespective of the dose and whether 
lixisenatide was administered as single or multiple doses, the median tmax is 1 to 3.5 hours in patients 
with type 2 diabetes. There are no clinically relevant differences in the rate of absorption when 
lixisenatide is administered subcutaneously in the abdomen, thigh, or arm. 
Distribution 
Lixisenatide has a moderate level of binding (55%) to human proteins. 
The apparent volume of distribution after subcutaneous administration of lixisenatide (Vz/F) is 
approximately 100 L.  
Biotransformation and elimination 
As a peptide, lixisenatide is eliminated through glomerular filtration, followed by tubular reabsorption 
and subsequent metabolic degradation, resulting in smaller peptides and amino acids, which are 
reintroduced in the protein metabolism.  
After multiple dose administration in patients with type 2 diabetes, mean terminal half-life was 
approximately 3 hours and the mean apparent clearance (CL/F) about 35 L/h. 
Special populations 
Patients with renal impairment 
In subjects with mild (creatinine clearance calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault formula 60-90 ml/min), 
moderate (creatinine clearance 30-60 ml/min) and severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-
30 ml/min) AUC was increased by 46%, 51% and 87%, respectively. 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
As lixisenatide is cleared primarily by the kidney, no pharmacokinetic study has been performed in 
patients with acute or chronic hepatic impairment. Hepatic dysfunction is not expected to affect the 
pharmacokinetics of lixisenatide. 
Gender 
Gender has no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of lixisenatide. 
Race 
Ethnic origin had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of lixisenatide based on the 
results of pharmacokinetic studies in Caucasian, Japanese and Chinese subjects.  
Elderly  
Age has no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of lixisenatide. 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In a pharmacokinetic study in elderly non-diabetic subjects, administration of lixisenatide 20 mcg 
resulted in a mean increase of lixisenatide AUC by 29% in the elderly population (11 subjects aged 65 
to 74 years and 7 subjects aged ≥75 years) compared to 18 subjects aged 18 to 45 years, likely related 
to reduced renal function in the older age group. 
Body weight 
Body weight has no clinically relevant effect on lixisenatide AUC. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazards for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology and toxicology. 
In 2-year subcutaneous carcinogenicity studies, non-lethal C-cell thyroid tumours were seen in rats 
and mice and are considered to be caused by a non-genotoxic GLP-1 receptor-mediated mechanism to 
which rodents are particularly sensitive. C-cell hyperplasia and adenoma were seen at all doses in rats 
and a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) could be not defined. In mice, these effects occurred 
at exposure ratio above 9.3-fold when compared to human exposure at the therapeutic dose. No C-cell 
carcinoma was observed in mice and C-cell carcinoma occurred in rats with an exposure ratio relative 
to exposure at human therapeutic dose of about 900-fold. In 2-year subcutaneous carcinogenicity study 
in mice, 3 cases of adenocarcinoma in the endometrium were seen in the mid dose group with a 
statistically significant increase, corresponding to an exposure ratio of 97-fold. No treatment-related 
effect was demonstrated. 
Animal studies did not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to male and female fertility in rats. 
Reversible testicular and epididymal lesions were seen in dogs treated with lixisenatide. No related 
effect on spermatogenesis was seen in healthy men. 
In embryo-foetal development studies, malformations, growth retardation, ossification retardation and 
skeletal effects were observed in rats at all doses (5-fold exposure ratio compared to human exposure) 
and in rabbits at high doses (32-fold exposure ratio compared to human exposure) of lixisenatide. In 
both species, there was a slight maternal toxicity consisting of low food consumption and reduced 
body weight. Neonatal growth was reduced in male rats exposed to high doses of lixisenatide during 
late gestation and lactation, with a slightly increased pup mortality observed.

1.  What Lyxumia is and what it is used for 
Lyxumia contains the active substance lixisenatide. 
It is an injectable medicine used to help your body to control your blood sugar level when it is too 
high. It is used in adults with type 2 diabetes. 
Lyxumia is used with other medicines for diabetes when they are not enough to control your blood 
sugar levels. These may include: 
• 
• 
oral antidiabetics (such as metformin, pioglitazone, sulphonylurea medicines) and/or,  
a basal insulin, a type of insulin which works all day. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Lyxumia  
Do not use Lyxumia  
- 
if you are allergic to lixisenatide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).  
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Lyxumia if:  
- 
- 
- 
- 
you have type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis (a complication of diabetes that occurs when 
the body is unable to break down glucose because there is not enough insulin) since this 
medicine will not be right for you 
you have or have had inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis)  
you have a severe stomach or gut problem such as a disease of the muscles of the stomach 
called “gastroparesis” which results in delayed stomach emptying 
you have severe kidney disease, or you are on dialysis as the use of this medicine will not be 
recommended  
50 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
- 
- 
you are also taking a sulphonylurea or a basal insulin. This is because low blood sugar 
(hypoglycaemia) can occur. Your doctor may want to control your blood sugar level and then, 
decide to reduce your dose of basal insulin or sulphonylurea. Lyxumia should not be used with a 
combination of both basal insulin and sulphonylurea 
you are taking other medicines, as there are other medicines such as antibiotics or stomach 
resistant tablets or capsules that should not stay too long in your stomach (see section Other 
medicines and Lyxumia) 
you experience loss of fluids/dehydration,e.g., in case of vomiting, nausea and diarrhoea. It is 
important to avoid dehydration by drinking plenty of fluids, especially when starting treatment 
with Lyxumia 
you suffer from heart problems which can cause shortness of breath or ankle swelling, since 
there is limited experience in this population. 
Children and adolescents 
There is no experience with Lyxumia in children and adolescents less than 18 years and therefore, the 
use of Lyxumia is not recommended in this age group. 
Other medicines and Lyxumia 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are using, have recently used or might use any other 
medicines. 
The effect of some medicines you swallow might be affected by Lyxumia. Some medicines such as 
antibiotics or stomach resistant tablets or capsules that should not stay too long in your stomach may 
need to be taken at least one hour before or four hours after your Lyxumia injection.  
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
Lyxumia should not be used during pregnancy. It is not known if Lyxumia may harm your unborn 
child.  
Lyxumia should not be used if breast-feeding. It is not known if Lyxumia passes into your milk.  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Driving and using machines  
If you use Lyxumia with a sulphonylurea or a basal insulin, you may get low blood sugar 
(hypoglycaemia). This may make it difficult to concentrate and you may feel dizzy or sleepy. If this 
happens do not drive or use any tools or machines. 
Important information about some of the ingredients of Lyxumia 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e., essentially “sodium-free”. 
This medicine contains metacresol which may cause allergic reactions.

pharmacist about how to dispose of sharps. 
Only use needles that are compatible for use with Lyxumia pen (see “Instructions for Use”). 
You must activate your Lyxumia pen before you use it for the first time. This is to make 
sure that it is working correctly and that the dose for your first injection is correct.  
If you think your Lyxumia pen may be damaged, do not use it. Get a new one. Do not try to 
repair the pen. 
• 
• 
• 
If you use more Lyxumia than you should  
If you use more Lyxumia than you should, talk to your doctor immediately. Too much Lyxumia can 
make you feel sick or be sick.  
If you forget to use Lyxumia

doses at the same time to make up for a forgotten injection.

•  Talk with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse about how to inject correctly before using it.

• 
Only use needles that are approved for use with Lyxumia. Use 29 to 32 gauge disposable pen 
needles with your Lyxumia pen. Ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse which needle gauge and 
length is best for you. 
If another person is giving the injection, they should take care not to injure anyone accidentally 
with the needle. This could possibly pass on infection. 
Always use a new needle for each injection. This helps prevent contamination of Lyxumia or 
possible needle blockage. 
Section 2 - GETTING STARTED 
•  Activate the pen on the same day as your first injection 
First activate your new pen 
•  Before injecting a dose - before injecting you must first remove excess liquid from your new 
pen. This is done once and is called the ‘activation’ process. Steps 1 to 5 below show you how to 
do this. 
•  Activation is done to make sure that the pen is working correctly and that the dose for your first 
injection is correct.  
•  Do not repeat the activation process or you will not obtain 14 doses from your Lyxumia pen. 
The pictures below show how the activation window on the injection button of your pen changes after 
activation.

Only use needles that are approved for use with Lyxumia. Use 29 to 32 gauge disposable pen 
needles with your Lyxumia pen. Ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse which needle gauge and 
length is best for you. 
If another person is giving the injection, they should take care not to injure anyone accidentally 
with the needle. This could possibly pass on infection. 
Always use a new needle for each injection. This helps prevent contamination of Lyxumia or 
possible needle blockage. 
Section 2 - GETTING STARTED 
•  Activate the pen on the same day as your first injection. 
First activate your new pen 
•  Before injecting a dose - before injecting you must first remove excess liquid from your new 
pen. This is done once and is called the ‘activation’ process. Steps 1 to 5 below show you how to 
do this. 
•  Activation is done to make sure that the pen is working correctly and that the dose for your first 
injection is correct. 
•  Do not repeat the activation process or you will not obtain 14 doses from your Lyxumia pen. 
The pictures below show how the activation window on the injection button of your pen changes after

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Multiple myeloma is a neoplastic plasma-cell disorder that is characterised by clonal proliferation of 
malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow microenvironment, monoclonal protein in the blood or 
urine, and associated organ dysfunction. Symptomatic multiple myeloma is characterised by 
hypercalcaemia, renal impairment, anaemia and bony lesions (collectively known as ‘‘CRAB’’). Multiple 
myeloma is primarily a disease of the elderly, with a median age at diagnosis of around 70 years. 37% 
of patients are younger than 65 years, 26% are between the ages of 65 and 74 years, and 37% are 75 
years of age or older. In patients presenting when less than 60 years of age, 10-year survival is 
approximately 30% (Palumbo and Anderson 2011).     
High dose chemotherapy (e.g. melphalan) followed by autologous stem cell transplant (HDT-ASCT) is 
the standard of care for previously untreated symptomatic multiple myeloma in patients under the age 
of 65 years. Various induction regimens are utilised prior to HDT-ASCT, or in patients ineligible for 
HDT-ASCT. Various regimens are also used in the consolidation, maintenance and relapsed / refractory 
settings. Historically, regimens such as melphalan + prednisolone (Salmon 1967) or vincristine + 
doxorubicin + dexamethasone (VAD) have been used.  
In recent years, the introduction of the immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) such as thalidomide, 
lenalidomide and pomalidomide, and the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib have changed the 
management of myeloma and extended overall survival. In Europe, Revlimid (lenalidomide) and 
Velcade (bortezomib) are approved in combination with high dose oral dexamethasone for the 
treatment of multiple myeloma.  
In a more advanced setting of Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma (RRMM), for patients who have 
received at least 2 prior therapies, including bortezomib and an IMiD, and have shown relapsed or 
refractory disease, pomalidomide (+dex) and panobinostat (+bortezomib + dex) are approved agents 
in the EU.   
The proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone was 
approved in the EU for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have 
Dexamethasone is a synthetic glucocorticoid; it combines high anti-inflammatory effects with low 
mineralocorticoid activity. At high doses (e.g. 40 mg), it reduces the immune response (SmPC section 
5.1). 
Dexamethasone has been shown to induce multiple myeloma cell death (apoptosis) via a down-
regulation of Nuclear Factor-κB activity and an activation of caspase-9 through second mitochondria-
derived activator of caspase (Smac; an apoptosis promoting factor) release. Prolonged exposure was 
required to achieve maximum levels of apoptotic markers along with increased caspase-3 activation 
and DNA fragmentation. Dexamethasone also down-regulated anti apoptotic genes and increased IκB-
α protein levels (SmPC section 5.1). 
Dexamethasone apoptotic activity is enhanced by the combination with thalidomide or its analogues 
and with proteasome inhibitor (e.g. bortezomib). Neofordex 40 mg tablets is a high dose oral 
dexamethasone formulation developed for use in adults for the treatment of symptomatic multiple 
myeloma in combination with other medicinal products. It is designed to be taken once daily as pulse 
therapy (for example days 1-4, 9-12 and 17-20 of a 28 day cycle). Dexamethasone tablet formulations 
currently approved in member states range from 0.5 mg to 8.0 mg strength (SmPC section 5.1).

The applicant applied for a marketing authorisation for the following indication which has been agreed 
by the CHMP: Neofordex is indicated in adults for the treatment of symptomatic multiple myeloma in 
combination with other medicinal products (SmPC section 4.1). 
The dose and administration frequency varies with the therapeutic protocol and the associated 
treatment(s). Neofordex administration should follow instructions for dexamethasone administration 
when described in the Summary of Product Characteristics of the associated treatment(s). If this is not 
the case, local or international treatment protocols and guidelines should be followed. Prescribing 
physicians should carefully evaluate which dose of dexamethasone to use, taking into account the 
condition and disease status of the patient. 
The usual posology of dexamethasone is 40 mg once per day of administration. 
At the end of dexamethasone treatment, the dose should be tapered in a stepwise fashion until a 
complete stop. 
In elderly and/or frail patients, the daily dose may be reduced to 20 mg of dexamethasone, according 
to the appropriate treatment regimen (SmPC section 4.2). 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction  
The finished product is presented as tablets containing dexamethasone acetate, equivalent to 40 mg 
dexamethasone as active substance. The tablets can be divided into two halves for administration of a 
20 mg dose. 
Other ingredients are: lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium stearate, colloidal 
anhydrous silica. 
The product is available in OPA/Aluminium /PVC-Aluminium perforated unit dose blisters as described 
in section 6.5 of the SmPC.  
2.2.1.  Active  substance 
General information 
The chemical name of the active substance is dexamethasone acetate corresponding to the molecular 
formula C24H31FO6 . It has a relative molecular mass of 434.5 g/mol and has the following structure: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/6613/2016   
Page 9/61 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dexamethasone acetate is a white or almost white crystalline powder, practically insoluble in water, 
and freely soluble in methanol, ethanol and acetone. 
Dexamethasone acetate exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of eight chiral centres. 
Enantiomeric purity is controlled routinely by optical rotation.  
There is a monograph for dexamethasone acetate in the European Pharmacopoeia.  The manufacturer 
of the active substance has been granted a Certificate of Suitability of the European Pharmacopoeia 
(CEP) for dexamethasone acetate which has been provided within the current Marketing Authorisation 
Application. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The relevant information has been assessed by the EDQM before issuing the Certificate of Suitability. 
Further data were provided on particle size and shape characterisation and on morphology. 
Dexamethasone acetate exhibits polymorphism; four different crystal forms have been described: two 
true polymorphs (form I and form II) and two hydrated forms (mono- and sesquihydrate). Possible 
phase transitions depending on temperature and humidity conditions were described. It was concluded 
that, starting from Form II, a sesquihydrate form (1.5 water equivalent per active substance molecule) 
is generated first under high relative humidity conditions, without forming the monohydrate. This 
sesquihydrate can then, according to the conditions, either revert to Form II, or give the monohydrate. 
Form I, the more stable form, can only be generated from Form II at high temperature, but not from 
the hydrated forms. Intrinsic Dissolution Rates (IDR) of the different polymorphs were studied. 
The morphology of the active substance produced by the active ingredient manufacturer is determined 
and controlled by an XRPD method with a test and control limits included within the specification for 
the active substance. 
Specification 
The control tests comply with the specification and test methods of the Ph. Eur. Monograph for 
dexamethasone acetate and additional test mentioned in the CEP. Additional specifications have also 
been set for particle size (laser diffraction) and polymorphism (XRPD). All additional methods have 
been adequately validated and described according to ICH Q2. 
Control limits for particle size distribution and morphology are justified in view of the characteristics of 
the batch of active substance used for the bioequivalence study.    
Batch analysis data from two production scale batches of the active substance have been provided. 
The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
The CEP for this source confirmed a retest period of up to 5 years, when stored in the proposed 
commercial pack.

2.2.2.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The dexamethasone 40 mg tablet was developed to enhance patient convenience in the treatment of 
multiple myeloma (MM) by providing a high strength oral formulation compared to other formulations 
available in the EU market.  In addition these tablets are scored to enable posology adjustment and 
administration of a 20 mg dose, when required. Due to concerns over the stability of the unpackaged, 
sub-divided tablet, the unused half tablet should be discarded (see also stability of the product section 
below). Despite this instruction, there is a risk that in practice, the spare half tablet may be retained 
and administered subsequently. In addition, there is also a concern on the difficulty that elderly and 
frail patients may have to sub-divide the tablets. In order to address these, the applicant committed to 
submit a marketing authorisation application (MAA) for a 20 mg oral dosage form with an indication in 
MM in order to eliminate the need to break the 40 mg tablets if a 20 mg dose is prescribed. A variation 
application should be submitted within 12 months of the first approval of a marketing authorisation for 
the 20 mg oral dosage form to eliminate the score line of the 40 mg tablet (see Risk Management 
Plan). 
The finished product composition includes dexamethasone acetate, lactose monohydrate, 
microcrystalline cellulose, colloidal anhydrous silica and magnesium stearate. 
Tablet formulations of dexamethasone with different qualitative and quantitative compositions were 
manufactured and studied to determine the formulation and method of manufacture that contribute to 
a pharmaceutically acceptable and stable product.   
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. In addition particle size distribution is controlled for microcrystalline cellulose and lactose 
monohydrate. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of 
excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report.  
Given the extremely poor aqueous solubility of the active substance, in vivo absorption is likely to be 
limited by dissolution rate. 
Bioequivalence of Neofordex 40 mg Tablet versus the reference product, Dectancyl 0.5 mg tablets was 
investigated utilising a 20 mg total dose for each arm.  Neofordex 40 mg tablets were sub-divided to 
provide the 20 mg dose.  The applicant has provided a justification for a biowaiver for the 40mg dose, 
on the basis that the conditions laid out in the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence 
(CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98) are fulfilled.  As the 20 mg dose, is simply a sub-division of the 40 mg 
dose, and the tablet disintegrates quickly (< 15 minutes), the biowaiver is considered acceptable. 
The development of the dissolution test proposed for routine Quality Control (QC) was described and 
the discriminatory power of the method was studied. The study performed showed that the dissolution 
method is discriminatory for tablets of different hardness. Dexamethasone acetate is known to exhibit 
polymorphism therefore several studies were performed to investigate the discriminatory power of the 
dissolution method regarding polymorphism. No comprehensive summary of data was provided to 
correlate the physical properties of the tablets (polymorphic ratio, hardness, water content) and their 
dissolution properties. Data provided suggest that the dissolution method is not discriminatory to the 
morphology of the active substance. As a result and, in the absence of in-vitro/in-vivo correlation 
studies, tests and control limits for detection of one of the polymorphic form by XRPD and water 
content were included in the finished product specifications at batch release and at the end of shelf-
life. This will ensure that polymorphic composition of the active substance does not change during the 
Assessment report

manufacture of the finished product and is consistent with the polymorphic form present in the 
bioequivalence study batch. In the absence of demonstration of the discriminatory power of the 
method toward active substance particle size distribution, stringent control limits were applied to active 
substance particle size distribution, based on the particle size distribution of active substance used in 
the batch used for the bioequivalence study.   
The primary packaging is a OPA/Aluminium /PVC-Aluminium perforated unit dose blister. The blister 
pack has perforations facilitating the separation of a packaged unit dose, suitable for the purposes of 
multi-dose compliance aids. The blister material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The 
choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the 
intended use of the product since it provides an effective barrier to environmental humidity.   
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of three main steps: dry mixing of the constituents followed by 
direct compression and packaging. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
 Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated on four production scale batches. 
Manufacturing conditions chosen prevent polymorphic form change. It has been demonstrated that the 
manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a 
reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process 
pharmaceutical form.  
Product specification  
The finished product specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: appearance, 
identification (TLC, HPLC), mean mass (Ph. Eur.), resistance to crushing (Ph. Eur.), residual humidity 
content (thermogravimetry), absence of other detectable  polymorph (XRPD), disintegration (Ph. Eur.), 
dissolution (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), content uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), divisibility test of 
tablets (Ph. Eur.), degradation products (HPLC) and microbial contamination (Ph. Eur.).  
The analytical methods have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines except for the XRPD method. The CHMP recommends that prior to 
commercialisation, the applicant generate satisfactory test method validation for XRPD method in line 
with the protocol submitted during procedure.  
Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has 
been presented. 
Batch analysis results were provided for several batches including two pilot scale batches and three 
production scale batches manufactured at the proposed manufacturing site, confirming the consistency 
of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data were provided for two production scale batches of finished product stored for up to 18 
months under long term conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH, up to 12 months under intermediate conditions 
at 30 ºC / 65% RH, and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH, according 
to the ICH guidelines. The batches of medicinal product are identical to those proposed for marketing 
and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/6613/2016   
Page 12/61 
 
 
 
 
 
Supportive stability data were also provided for batches manufactured on another site than the one 
proposed for marketing or packed in different primary packaging that the one proposed for marketing. 
For the primary stability batches, samples were tested for appearance, average unit mass, dissolution, 
disintegration of tablets, residual humidity content, resistance to crushing of tablets, assay, impurities 
and microbiological quality. The analytical procedures for determination of degradation products have 
been shown to be stability indicating. Tests for uniformity of content on subdivided tablets were not 
performed; however this has been adequately demonstrated in the supportive stability lots.  
Out of specification dissolution results after 3 months storage at 40˚C/75%RH were observed for the 
supportive stability batches stored in the PVC/PVdC blister presentation. However no significant 
changes have been observed for the finished product with the primary packaging proposed for 
marketing confirming the choice of the packaging material.   
In view of this, additional stability data were requested during the procedure  to demonstrate absence 
of any other polymorphic form other than the desired one. Data from two batches of finished product, 
stored in the primary packaging proposed for marketing at an 18 month time point at 30˚C/65%RH 
and 40˚C/75%RH were provided.  The justification provided by the applicant for the absence of XRPD 
analysis in the stability study for the product stored at 25˚C/65%RH was considered acceptable. 
In light of these data, a shelf-life of up to 24 months with no special temperature storage condition, as 
stated in the SmPC, was considered to be acceptable.    
No photostability data have been presented for the finished product.  The active substance is known to 
be photosensitive, which is reflected by inclusion of “protect from light” statements in the Ph. Eur. 
monograph for dexamethasone acetate and the BP monograph for dexamethasone tablets.  This is 
confirmed by the results of forced degradation studies. As a result, the applicant’s proposal not to 
perform studies on the finished product, but to include a storage precaution in the SmPC was 
accepted.   
Stability of sub-divided, unpackaged tablets 
Stability data have been provided for a single lot of sub-divided tablets stored for 15 days at 
25oC/60%RH, 30oC/65%RH and 30oC/75%RH in the following presentations: a “weighing plate”, a 
HDPE container with desiccant, a PVC/PVdC blister. Only the open-dish study was considered to 
satisfactorily simulate the potential environment that a sub-divided tablet that has been removed from 
its packaging would encounter. All test parameters remained with the proposed control limits; however 
a decrease in extent of release was apparent for tablets stored at 30˚C/75%RH.  It was noted that 
XRPD analysis was not performed in this study to confirm an absence of polymorphic change.  
Nevertheless, during the studies performed to evaluate the discriminatory power of the dissolution 
method, substantial changes in dissolution performance were observed for unpackaged product 
exposed to accelerated conditions of 40˚C/75%RH for a total of 12 days.  XRPD analysis on those 
samples showed that the changes in dissolution performance were consistent with polymorphic 
transitions and they have potential to impact bioavailability.  Following CHMP request, the Applicant 
developed an XPRD method to quantify one of the polymorphic forms in the finished product. Using 
this method, conversion of dexamethasone polymorphic form has been studied under a range of “open 
dish” conditions. Under open-dish conditions, particularly at 84% humidity, tablet integrity was 
significantly disrupted, such that tablet crushing strength was no longer measurable, and 
corresponding dissolution results were within the specification limits. It was noticed that these data 
conflict somewhat with the results of the dissolution discrimination studies that were provided at the 
submission of this application to evaluate the impact on dissolution performance of open-dish exposure

to a range of environmental conditions.  Taking into account the latest stability data provided during 
the procedure and following CHMP request, the applicant withdrew the initial proposal for a two week 
in-use shelf-life for halved tablets and agreed to have the following storage precaution in the SmPC 
“Halved tablets that are not taken immediately should be disposed of”.   
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months with no special temperature 
storage condition and the following storage conditions are acceptable:  “Tablets should be kept in the 
blister package until administration. Individual tablets in intact packaging should be separated from the 
blister using the perforation, e.g. for use in multi-compartment compliance aids. Halved tablets that 
are not taken immediately should be disposed of”, as stated in the SmPC (section 6.4)”. 
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as 
those used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the 
use of ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the 
Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal 
products. 
2.2.3.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
There is a monograph for dexamethasone acetate in the European Pharmacopoeia.  The manufacturer 
of the active substance has been granted a Certificate of Suitability of the European Pharmacopoeia 
(CEP) for dexamethasone acetate which has been provided within the current Marketing Authorization 
Application. In addition to controls described in the Ph. Eur. monograph and in the CEP, controls of 
particle size (laser diffraction) and morphology (XRPD) were included in the active substance 
specifications. 
 It has been shown that dissolution of the tablets can be affected by changes in physical properties of 
the product, and potentially by changes in active substance morphology, which can occur following 
exposure to high humidity. No clear correlation has been defined between polymorphic forms content, 
water content, tablet hardness and dissolution behaviour/bioavailability of the finished product. 
Polymorphic form of the active substance as it is and in the finished product is controlled to ensure 
consistency with the morphology of the drug substance studied in vivo. The manufacturing conditions 
chosen prevent polymorphic change and tablet physical degradation. The primary packaging, 
OPA/Aluminium /PVC-Aluminium perforated unit dose blister, provides an effective barrier to 
environmental humidity and prevents other polymorphic forms formation during storage. However due 
to concerns over the stability of the unpackaged, sub-divided tablet, the unused half tablet should be 
discarded. Appropriate storage precautions were included in the SmPC.  
Despite this instruction, there is a risk that in practice, the spare half tablet may be retained and 
administered subsequently. In addition, there is also a concern on the difficulty that elderly and frail 
patients may have to sub-divide the tablets. In order to address these, the applicant committed to 
submit a marketing authorization application (MAA) for a 20 mg oral dosage form with an indication in 
MM in order to eliminate the need to break the 40 mg tablets if a 20 mg dose is prescribed. A variation 
application should be submitted within 12 months of the first approval of a marketing authorization for 
the 20 mg oral dosage form to eliminate the score line of the 40 mg tablet (see Risk Management 
Plan).

In general, information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished 
product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the 
conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there was a number of minor unresolved quality issue related to 
validation of the method for control of morphology, however this is considered to have no impact on 
the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product.  
2.2.4.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on TSE safety. 
2.2.5.  Recommendation for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
The applicant should generate prior to commercialisation satisfactory test method validation for XRPD 
methodology in line with protocol submitted during procedure. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects   
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, 
which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no 
need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
Cultured ARP-1 multiple myeloma cells (derived from human bone marrow) were shown to undergo 
extensive apoptosis (>60%) following treatment with a clinically relevant dose of 0.1 μmol/L 
dexamethasone for 48 hours.  This effect was inhibited in transfected ARP-1 cells that over-expressed 
human bcl-2.  In the ARP-1 cells, dexamethasone-induced apoptosis correlated with the inhibition of 
the DNA binding of NF-κB. The incubation of ARP-1 cells with dexamethasone inhibited NF-κB DNA 
binding by 5.4%, 30% and 56% after 1, 3 and 6 hours, respectively.  Dexamethasone also rapidly 
increased the expression of the inhibitor of κBα protein (IκBα; an intracellular protein that functions as 
a primary inhibitor of NF-κB) in bcl-2 over-expressing ARP-1 cells.  The inhibition of NF-κB DNA binding 
was noted to be an early event in the commitment phase of dexamethasone-induced apoptosis.  To 
determine the relationship between persistent NF-κB activity, bcl-2 expression and resistance to

dexamethasone-induced apoptosis, studies were conducted using bcl-2 over-expressing ARP-1 cells 
and two dexamethasone-resistant human multiple myeloma cell lines which expressed moderate 
endogenous levels of bcl-2.  The resistance to both dexamethasone-induced and spontaneous 
apoptosis appeared to be associated with the level of bcl-2 expression and maintenance of constitutive 
NF-κB activation.  Similar results were observed in dexamethasone-treated primary multiple myeloma 
cells derived from patient bone marrow samples.  The reduction of NF-κB DNA binding correlated with 
the patients’ sensitivity to dexamethasone; as assessed by the decline in serum or urine 
paraprotein/tumour specific immunoglobulin levels (Feinman at al., 1999). 
The efficiency and kinetics of dexamethasone was evaluated using three well-characterised myeloma 
cell lines, BCN, NON8 and OPM2 The cell lines were exposed to a constant AUC of dexamethasone, 
while varying in reverse proportion the time of exposure (6, 16, 23 and 40 hours) and the 
concentration of dexamethasone in the cell culture medium (510, 191, 127 and 76 nM).  The AUC was 
chosen to correspond to a 40 mg dose of Neofordex calculated according to the results of study CPA 
402-11, in order to achieve clinically relevant exposure.  The three cell lines, differed in terms of 
chromosomal rearrangement, pro-oncogene overexpression and relative level of glucocorticoid 
receptor expression, and were selected as they exhibit different sensitivity to dexamethasone.  Cells 
were assayed for proliferation and apoptosis. For comparison, the same cell lines were exposed to 
melphalan (a chemotherapy drug used to treat multiple myeloma), again at clinically relevant 
concentrations.  The time of exposure was 6 hours, as a clinical dose is completely cleared in this time.   
At constant exposure to dexamethasone, cell survival decreased with increasing time of incubation, 
even where the dexamethasone concentration in the medium was lower than at shorter incubation 
times.  At 40 hours of exposure to dexamethasone, cell survival was significantly lower than at 6 hours 
exposure in all three cell lines.  After 6 hours of exposure to a very high concentration of 
dexamethasone, cell survival was influenced only to a negligible degree. 
Cell death was induced by dexamethasone during its presence in the medium.  After removal of 
dexamethasone from the medium, cell death was constant over time or showed an apparent decrease 
due to the proliferation of cells that had not been driven into apoptosis when dexamethasone was 
present in the culture medium.  In contrasts, exposure to melphalan for 6 hours decreased cell survival 
in a concentration-dependent manner.  Melphalan irreversibly induced cell death during a short 
exposure due to its alkylating activity, resulting in apoptosis peaking 96 hours after exposure.  When 
comparing the percentage of cell death induced by melphalan to that induced by dexamethasone in the 
same 6 hours of exposure, the difference at 96 hours post-exposure was statistically significant for all 
cell lines and conditions. 
The kinetics of dexamethasone-induced gene expression was investigated using oligonucleotide arrays 
in dexamethasone-sensitive multiple myeloma (MM.1S) cells (Chauhan et al., 2002).  Relatively few 
genes were upregulated within the first 4 hours of treatment with 10 μmol/L dexamethasone, 
suggesting that the initial stress response was not mediated through gene induction.  Various 
apoptosis-related genes, including CFLAR (also known as CLARP or Flip), Tis11d, and IκB-α were 
detected at 2 hours of treatment and maximum levels at 24 hours.  Following similar kinetics, anti-
apoptotic genes, such as Bcl-xL, were significantly down-regulated in cultured myeloma cells in 
response to dexamethasone treatment.  Dexamethasone treatment of MM.1S cells also produced 
increased IκB-α protein levels and reduced NF-κB DNA binding.   
The kinetics and dose-dependency of dexamethasone-induced apoptosis were further studied in 
multiple myeloma cells expressing wild-type and mutant glucocorticoid receptors (Sharma and 
Lichtenstein, 2008).  Dexamethasone induced apoptosis in these cell lines in a dose-dependent 
manner.  Substantial caspase-3 (a cysteine aspartic acid protease involved in apoptosis) activity was 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/6613/2016   
Page 16/61 
 
 
 
 
 
detected in cells cultured in the presence of 10 nmol/L or 1 μmol/L dexamethasone for 60 hours.  In 
cells cultured with 1 μM dexamethasone, caspase-3 activity was lower at 48 hours (approximately 
20%) than at 60 hours (approximately 40%).   
In a study on the effect of dexamethasone on cultured MM.1S cells, dexamethasone induced the 
release of second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (Smac; an apoptosis-promoting factor) 
into the cytosol and activated caspase-9 (Chauhan et al, 2001).  Smac was released 12 hours after 
exposure to 10 μmol/L dexamethasone and increased for up to 48 hours; caspase-9 activation followed 
similar kinetics.  Caspase-8 (a cysteine aspartic acid protease involved in apoptosis) was not activated.  
Interleukin-6 (IL-6; a growth factor for multiple myeloma) blocked dexamethasone-induced apoptosis 
in the cultured MM.1S cells and prevented the mitochondrial release of Smac. 
Thalidomide, its IMiDs pomalidomide and lenalidomide and dexamethasone induced cell death in 
MM.1S cells (Hideshima et al., 2000; Hideshima at al., 2001).  These IMiDs act directly by inducing 
apoptosis or G1 growth arrest in myeloma cell lines and in patient multiple myeloma cells that are 
resistant to dexamethasone, melphalan and doxorubicin.  Moreover, thalidomide and the IMiDs 
enhanced the anti-multiple myeloma activity of dexamethasone.  However, in MM.1S cells, the 
inhibition of DNA synthesis induced by thalidomide and the IMiDs was greatly reduced by IL-6.  
Apoptotic signalling triggered by dexamethasone (12 hours treatment with 10 μmol/L) and IMiDs was 
shown to be associated with the activation of protein-tyrosine kinase 2-beta (PTK-β).  The activation of 
PTK-β by IMiDs was also shown in dexamethasone-resistant cell lines. 
The growth of MM.1S cells and dexamethasone-resistant multiple myeloma (MM.1R) cell lines was 
completely inhibited by bortezomib (a marketed proteosome inhibitor used in the treatment of multiple 
myeloma; Hideshimaet al., 2001).  Dexamethasone (0.001 to 0.625 μmol/L) and bortezomib (0.0025 
and 0.005 μmol/L) alone inhibited MM.1S cell growth in a dose-dependent manner.  The inhibitory 
effect was additive when cells were cultured in the presence of both dexamethasone and bortezomib 
combined.  In contrast to its inhibitory effect on dexamethasone- and IMiD-induced apoptosis, IL-6 did 
not abolish the inhibitory effect of bortezomib on multiple myeloma cell growth.  In addition, 
bortezomib blocked NF-κB activation and IL-6 activation in cultured human bone marrow stromal cells 
(BMSC). 
In a further study, carfilzomib (a proteasome inhibitor) induced apoptosis in multiple myeloma cells 
(cell lines and patient-derived plasma cells) and activated the caspase-8 and caspase-9 pathways 
(Kuhn et al., 2007).  The reduced proliferation observed in cell lines incubated with carfilzomib and 
dexamethasone combined was synergistically greater than in those treated with the individual drugs 
alone.   
Additional studies have also shown the synergistic effect of dexamethasone and IMiDs or bortezomib 
combined in the induction of multiple myeloma cell death (Mitsiades at al., 2002).  In in vitro assays, 
IMiDs (referred to as IMiD1 and IMiD3) were shown to induce caspase-8, but not caspase-9, activity in 
cultured myeloma cell lines (MM.1S, OCI-My-5 and S6B45 cells) and bone marrow mononuclear cells 
derived from multiple myeloma patient cells; whereas dexamethasone activated caspase-9, as 
mentioned above.  IMiD-induced apoptosis was shown to be caspase-8-dependent.  The pretreatment 
of MM.1S cells with IMiDs resulted in increased Fas- (a protein involved in apoptosis) and TRAIL/Apo2L 
(tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand)-induced apoptosis.  In these IMiDs treated 
cells, there was no reduction in bcl-2 protein expression. Pomalidomide treatment alone down-
regulated constitutive NF-κB DNA-binding activity in a multiple myeloma cell line.  The combination of 
dexamethasone with pomalidomide totally abolished the NF-κB activity.  Pomalidomide also enhanced 
the induction of myeloma cell death induced by dexamethasone or bortezomib.

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Based on the literature data, the pharmacokinetics of dexamethasone have been studied in mice, rats, 
dogs and pigs using either [3H] labelled or unlabelled drug. The routes of administration used were 
intravenous, oral, intramuscular, intraperitoneal and subcutaneous.   
Absorption  
In rats orally administered 10 mg/kg [3H]-dexamethasone, serum concentrations of the drug were up 
to 2.3 x 10-5 mol/L.  Following the intravenous administration of the same dose, the Cmax was 
determined to be 4.5x10-5 mol/L (Moldenhauer, 1991). 
Distribution 
In an in vitro study using equilibrium dialysis, the binding of dexamethasone to plasma proteins in rat, 
dog, cow, and human was approximately 85, 73, 74, and 77%, respectively (Peets, 1969).  No in vitro 
transport studies with dexamethasone have been reported. 
In mice intravenously administered 0.2 mg/kg [3H]-dexamethasone, the highest concentrations of 
radioactivity at 4 hours post dose were found in the gall bladder and bile (5231 ng/g tissue) and liver 
(824 ng/g tissue), colon (73 ng/g tissue) and kidney (38 ng/g tissue) (Schinkel, 1995). 
Following an intravenous dose of 39.5 μg [3H]-dexamethasone sodium phosphate to rats, the highest 
percentage of administered radioactivity was found in muscle (35.5%), liver (36.0%) and kidney 
(4.5%) within 15 minutes post dose.  The levels of radioactivity in the tissues declined steadily 
thereafter (Mizushima, 1982).   
Metabolism 
The hepatic metabolism of dexamethasone was shown to occur in a two-step process: the addition of 
oxygen or hydrogen atoms followed by steroid conjugation (glucuronidation and sulphation) (Czock, 
2005).  Dexamethasone phosphate is rapidly hydrolysed in serum and the metabolism of 
dexamethasone acetate is expected to be similar. 
In an in vitro study using mouse, rat, hamster, guinea pig, rabbit, dog and human liver microsome 
preparations, dexamethasone was shown to be extensively metabolised to 6-hydroxydexamethasone 
and side-chain cleaved metabolites to various extents.    
The inhibitory potency of ketoconazole (a CYP3A4 inhibitor) and glycyrrhetinic acid (a specific inhibitor 
of 11-dehydrogenase) on dexamethasone metabolism was investigated.  6-Hydroxylation was variable 
(highest in the hamster), not always the major route of metabolism and its formation was sex-specific 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/6613/2016   
Page 18/61 
 
 
 
 
 
in the rat.  The inhibition of 6-hydroxylation by ketoconazole also varied.  Cytosolic preparations 
produced similar profiles in different species with the formation of a metabolite (M5) which was 
inhibited by glycyrrhetinic acid and tentatively identified as 11-dehydro-side-chain cleaved 
dexamethasone (11DH-9αF-A).  The metabolic profile of dexamethasone in the male rat was most 
similar to that seen in humans. 
Another in vitro study using rat liver slices showed that approximately 10% of the recovered 
drug-related material was associated with conjugated products (Dollery, 1999).   
Dexamethasone metabolism in the liver was reported to be slow and limited (Dollery, 1999).  In rat 
urine, unconjugated drug and its metabolites consisted of dexamethasone (48%), 
6β-hydroxydexamethasone (30%), 20-dihydrodexamethasone (5%) and 11-ketodexamethasone 
(approximately 1%).  Details of the metabolic pathway of dexamethasone metabolism were not 
provided.   
Excretion 
Dexamethasone and its metabolites are excreted in the urine and bile (Hichens, 1974; Van Leeuwen, 
2010). 
In rats intravenously administered 39.5 μg [3H]-dexamethasone sodium phosphate, the half-life of 
radioactivity was 2.8 hours (Mizushima, 1982). The cumulative (0-96 hours) urinary and faecal 
recovery in rats orally dosed [3H]-dexamethasone (1.14 nmol/kg) amounted to 31% and 25% of the 
administered radioactivity, respectively (Van Leeuwen, 2010).  In male rats, intraperitoneally 
administered 0.23 μmol [1,2-3H]dexamethasone, 74% was excreted within 96 hours; 30.4% in urine 
and 43.6% in faeces (Van Leeuwen, 2010).  Thirty two percent of the radioactivity detected in the 
urine was associated with a polar metabolite of dexamethasone, considered likely to be 6-
hydroxydexamethasone (Rice, 1974; Van Leeuwen, 2010).   In rats administered an intramuscular 
dose of 9 μg/kg [1,2,4-3H]-dexamethasone, 41% and 44% of the administered radioactivity was 
detected in urine at 0-24 hours and 0-96 hours, respectively (Van Leeuwen, 2010). 
In dogs intravenously administered 1 mg/kg dexamethasone alcohol or dexamethasone 
21-isonicotinate, the half time of elimination was 120 to 140 minutes (Van Leeuwen, 2010). 
In pigs, subcutaneously administered [1,2-3H]-dexamethasone-21-trimethylacetate, less than 1% of 
total plasma radioactivity was extractable as unchanged [3H]-dexamethasone-21-acetate at 4 hours 
post dose (Van Leeuwen, 2010).  The plasma concentration of dexamethasone was highest 
(approximately 3 ng/ml) at 4 hours, declining rapidly to approximately 0.5 ng/mL at 24 hours, and 
slowly thereafter.  Measurable amounts of dexamethasone (>0.2 ng/ml) were still present at 5 days 
post dose. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
Dexamethasone is a well-known inducer of CYP3A4.  In studies in rats, dexamethasone treatment 
increased liver and intestinal CYP3A mRNA and protein by 5- and 7-fold, respectively, and intestinal 
and hepatic P-gp expression by 2- and 3-fold (Lin, 1999).  Similar results were observed in other 
studies (Dexamethasone PK Interaction Report).  The induction of CYP3A4 and P-gp is reported to be 
the basis of a multitude of observed pharmacokinetic drug interactions. 
The table below provides the results of studies from the published literature on pharmacokinetic drug-
drug interactions with dexamethasone.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity  
In mice (sex/group not specified) orally, intravenously or intraperitoneally administered 
dexamethasone sodium phosphate, the LD50 values were 6.5, 794 and 577 mg/kg, respectively (which 
corresponded to 4.9, 603 and 439 mg/kg dexamethasone; Van Leeuwen, 2010).  The acute systemic 
toxicity of dexamethasone was low.   
In rats (8 males/group) subcutaneously administered dexamethasone at 6, 15, 30, 60 and 120 mg/kg, 
deaths occurred at ≥30 mg/kg on Days 6 and 7 post dose and were attributed to infection.  Body 
weight loss (approximately 29.5%) occurred at the highest doses; at the intermediate and lower 
doses, arrest and retardation of growth, respectively, were observed.  By 21 days post dose, body 
weight gains ranged from 11 to 104 g.  At autopsy, multiple small abscesses in the lungs, kidneys, 
and/or liver were observed in randomly selected animals (Tonelli, 1966). 
Repeat dose toxicity

in rats and dogs is presented in Table 6.

In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following point for further investigation to be addressed: 
The applicant should revise the ERA to include the proposed transformation study in aquatic sediment 
systems, consumption data on dexamethasone acetate in relation to its use in multiple myeloma, 
literature analysis on the known endocrine disruptor activity of dexamethasone in the fish species or 
submit a protocol for a Fish Full Life-Cycle test for endorsement as appropriate. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
A series of in vitro studies were reported from literature. Dexamethasone has been shown to induce 
multiple myeloma cell death via a down-regulation of NF-κB activity and an activation of caspase-9 
through Smac release.  IL-6 and high bcl-2 levels antagonised dexamethasone induced apoptosis.  
Early apoptotic markers (CFLAR, Tis11d or IκB-α) were rapidly detectable following exposure to 
dexamethasone.  However, prolonged exposure was required to achieve their maximum levels along 
with increased caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation. Dexamethasone also down regulated anti-
apoptotic genes and increased IκB-α protein levels. The duration of exposure of three different 
myeloma cell lines to dexamethasone, and not the concentration of dexamethasone, was shown to be 
the factor related to decreased cell survival.  Dexamethasone-induced apoptosis in myeloma cells was 
synergistically enhanced by the co-treatment with thalidomide, IMiDs or proteasome inhibitors.  
The interaction information in the proposed Neofordex SmPC is derived from the SmPC of the 
reference medicinal product.  
There are no studies to date which have evaluated the potential impact of genetic polymorphisms on 
the metabolism, safety or efficacy of Neofordex.  Polymorphisms in CYPs and transporters may lead to 
differences in dexamethasone pharmacokinetics and to variability in drug-drug interactions with 
Assessment report

dexamethasone.  Data on sub-populations carrying known and relevant genetic polymorphism is 
considered to be important missing information and is noted in the Neofordex Risk Management Plan 
(see Risk Management Plan). 
Glucocorticoids have only weak acute toxicity. No chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity data are 
available. Genotoxicity findings have been shown to be artefactual. In reproductive toxicity studies in 
mice, rats, hamsters, rabbits and dogs, dexamethasone has led to embryo-fetal malformations such as 
increase in cleft palate and skeletal defects; decreases in thymus, spleen and adrenal weight; lung, 
liver, and kidney abnormalities; and inhibition of growth. Post-natal development assessment of 
animals treated prenatally presented decreased glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, behavioural 
alterations and decrease in brain and body weight. In males, fertility may be decreased through germ 
cell apoptosis and spermatogenic defects. Data on female fertility are contradictory (SmPC, section 
5.3). 
Women should avoid pregnancy during Neofordex treatment. Dexamethasone may cause congenital 
malformations. Dexamethasone may be used with known teratogens (e.g. thalidomide, lenalidomide, 
pomalidomide, plerixafor), or with cytotoxic substances which are not recommended in pregnancy. 
Patients receiving Neofordex in combination with products containing thalidomide, lenalidomide or 
pomalidomide should adhere to the pregnancy prevention programmes of those products. Reference 
should be made to all the relevant Summary of Product Characteristics prior to the commencement of 
any combination treatment for additional information (see section 4.6). 
Studies in animals have shown reductions in female fertility. No data on male fertility are available 
SmPC section 4.6). 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall the Non-clinical Overview is considered acceptable to support the clinical use of 
dexamethasone for the treatment of symptomatic multiple myeloma in combination with other 
medicinal products.   
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for 40 mg tablet containing dexamethasone. To support the marketing 
authorisation application the applicant conducted one single dose bioequivalence study with cross-over 
design in healthy volunteers under fasting conditions.  
No new clinical efficacy and safety data is provided. However, in support of the proposed indication and 
posology, the applicant has submitted full clinical study reports (one pharmacokinetic study, 4 efficacy 
and safety studies). The data concerns other formulations of dexamethasone in combination with the 
centrally authorised products Thalidomide Celgene 50 mg hard capsules, Revlimid 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 
mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 25 mg hard capsules (lenalidomide) and Imnovid 1 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg and 4 mg 
hard capsules (pomalidomide). A number of literature reports are also submitted. 
A signed authorisation from Celgene Europe Limited, the Sponsor for the submitted clinical study 
reports, has been provided.  
No formal scientific advice by the CHMP was given for this medicinal product. For the clinical 
assessment Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1) in its

current version is of particular relevance. 
GCP 
The Clinical trial CPA-402-11 was performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the EU were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
Clinical studies 
One bioequivalence study (CPA-402-11) has been submitted. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics  
Methods 
Study design  
This was a randomised single-dose, open-label, two-period, two-treatment, two-sequence crossover 
comparative bioavailability study of Neofordex 40 mg tablets versus Dectancyl 0.5 mg tablets (Sanofi-
Aventis France) in healthy volunteers under fasting conditions. 
The primary objective was to assess the bioequivalence of half of a tablet of the test product 
Neofordex 40 mg tablets versus 44 tablets of the reference formulation Dectancyl 0.5 mg tablets 
(Sanofi-Aventis France) after a single oral dose. A secondary objective was to evaluate the safety and 
tolerability of these formulations.  
This study took place at a single centre. Study drugs were administered at least 10 hours after a 
supervised overnight fast. The test or reference product was administered with 250 mL of water, 
according to the randomisation schedule. The test product was administered as half a tablet (cut in 
half and stored in a labelled bottle prior to administration). The reference product was administered as 
44 tablets (counted into a labelled bottle prior to administration). Additional water (in volumes of 100 
mL) was provided to facilitate swallowing of the reference tablets in some subjects. The test and 
reference tablets were swallowed whole and were not chewed or broken. Immediately after 
administration, the subject’s oral cavity and hands were checked to confirm complete medication and 
fluid intake. Subjects remained fasting for 4 hours post-dose.  
Twenty-one (21) blood samples (4 mL each) were collected at time 0 (pre-dose), and at 0.17, 0.33, 
0.50, 0.75, 1.00, 1.25, 1.50, 1.75, 2.0, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 24 and 36 hours after drug 
administration in each study period. Actual collection times were recorded. The blood samples were 
immediately shaken gently and stored in a water/ice bath at +4±2°C until centrifugation within 10 
minutes after collection. The plasma samples were transferred into labelled polypropylene tubes in two 
splits, then capped and frozen on dry ice. The samples were stored at the study site’s bioanalytical 
laboratory in a freezer with continuously controlled temperature of -25°C (range -20°C to -35°C) until 
shipment in dry ice to the analytical facility. Plasma concentrations of the parent drug dexamethasone 
were determined in plasma using a validated HPLC-MS/MS method. The bioassay was blinded 
regarding the treatment sequences. The washout period was at least 12 days.

Test and reference products  
The test product Neofordex 40 mg Tablets contains 40 mg of dexamethasone base corresponding to 
44.3 mg of dexamethasone acetate. Dectancyl 0.5 mg tablets contain 0.5 mg of dexamethasone 
acetate corresponding to 0.451 mg of dexamethasone base. Consequently the molar dose of the half 
tablet of Neofordex 40 mg Tablets represents 100.81% of the molar dose of 44 tablets of the reference 
product Dectancyl 0.5 mg tablets.

Twenty-four healthy volunteers (12 male, 12 female), aged 19-55, body mass index (BMI) 20.6 – 29.7 
kg/m2 were enrolled and gave informed consent. All subjects were Caucasian. Subjects were screened 
for eligibility within 28 days prior to dosing, according to standard inclusion and exclusion criteria for 
this type of study. All subjects completed the study and were included in the pharmacokinetic (PK) and 
statistical analysis. Subjects were non-smokers or mild smokers (no more than 9 cigarettes, 2 cigars 
or 2 pipes per day). Smoking and alcohol were prohibited for 48 hours prior to and 36 hours after drug 
administration. Subjects were confined at least 11.5 hours before and 24 hours after dosing.  
Analytical methods   
Content of dexamethasone in plasma was determined by liquid/liquid extraction of dexamethasone 
from plasma, followed by HPLC separation with mass spectrometric detection (LC–MS/MS).  
Flumethasone was used as an internal standard.  Chromatographic separation was performed with a 
Zorbax SB C18 column with isocratic elution of purified water containing 0.5% of acetic acid / ethanol 
(67:33 v/v).  The method has been demonstrated to be linear between the lower limit of quantification 
(LLOQ) of 1.00 ng/ml and the upper limit of quantification (ULOQ) of 250 ng/ml.

Bioavailability study plasma samples were stored at -20oC until analysis which was performed from 12 
March to 30 March 2012, a storage period that is covered by stability data.   
The concentrations of dexamethasone were determined in 1008 samples from 1 clinical site.  All 
requirements for study acceptance were fulfilled. More than 67% of incurred samples reanalysed were 
within ± 20%.  The calibration curve covered the expected unknown sample concentration range 
except for 10 samples which were re-assayed after a 2-fold dilution.  The samples have been stored at 
approximately -20oC in a freezer of the test facility; no plasma sample underwent more than 3 
freeze/thaw cycles. Acceptable stability data to cover these conditions has been showed  in a method 
validation report, which also provided appropriate assurance of selectivity, carry-over, matrix effect, 
linearity, extraction recovery, within- and between-run accuracy and precision and  LLOQ.   
Pharmacokinetic variables  
The primary PK parameters were AUC0-36 and Cmax. Tmax, AUC0-∞, residual area, λz, and half-life were 
also calculated. Actual sampling time-points were used in the PK analysis. A non-compartmental 
method was used. The validated program PhoenixTM WinNonlin version 6.1 (Pharsight Corporation, St. 
Louis, MO, USA) was used for the calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters. 
Statistical methods   
The 90% bioequivalence criteria were pre-defined as 80.00-125.00% for both AUC0-36 and Cmax.  
The treatment sequences were generated using a computer random number generator (SAS version 
9.2). Subjects were assigned to the treatment sequence in a strict chronological order.  
The 90% confidence intervals for the ratio test/reference of the geometric least square means were 
used for the bioequivalence assessment based on logarithmically-transformed data of Cmax and AUC0-36 
in all evaluable subjects. Comparisons between treatments were done using the linear mixed model, 
where effects of treatment, period and sequence are taken as fixed and the effect of subjects nested 
within sequence as random. This model was applied using the procedure MIXED implemented in the 
statistical package SAS version 9.2 or higher. The Tmax was analyzed without ln-transformation using 
the non-parametric Wilcoxon’s test.

Sampling around Tmax occurred less frequently for the test product compared to the reference 
product, due to a longer actual Tmax. However, based on the concentration-time profiles derived, it is 
judged that more frequent sampling around 3 hours would not have significantly altered the conclusion 
regarding AUC0-36.  
Conclusions 
The bioavailability of Neofordex 40 mg tablets is comparable to that of the reference product Dectancyl 
0.5 mg tablets (Sanofi-Aventis France, France), as measured by AUC0-36. The Cmax of Neofordex 40 
mg tablets is significantly lower than that of Dectancyl 0.5 mg tablets. The applicant has provided 
relevant non-clinical in vitro data to support the low relevance of the Cmax value in the clinical efficacy 
of dexamethasone in multiple myeloma treatment (see Section 2.3.2 Primary pharmacodynamic 
studies). The extrapolation of this non-clinical data to the clinical situation is considered acceptable. 
The results of study CPA 402-11 with 40 mg formulation (half tablet) may be extrapolated to 40 mg 
(whole tablet), according to conditions in Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence 
CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1, section 4.1.6. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Study CC-5013-MM-017-PK 
The applicant submitted the following clinical study report, with consent from the sponsor (Celgene 
Europe Limited): ‘A multicentre, phase I study to determine the maximum tolerated dose, safety, 
pharmacokinetics and efficacy of lenalidomide with and without dexamethasone in Japanese subjects 
with previously treated multiple myeloma.’ 
Phamacokinetic parameters of dexamethasone 40 mg, in combination with lenalidomide, were derived, 
for 6 patients with previously treated multiple myeloma, during days 1-12 of cycle 1. This cohort 
received lenalidomide at 25 mg QD on Days 1 and 3-12 and dexamethasone at 40 mg QD on Days 2-4 
and 9-12. Subjects in the Combination Treatment Cohort did not receive dexamethasone on Day 1 and 
lenalidomide on Day 2 to allow the evaluation of the single dose pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone on Day 1 and Day 2, respectively. Serial sampling of blood was done on days 2 and 12 
for dexamethasone analysis, following an overnight fast. The dexamethasone formulation, supplied by 
the sponsor, was 4 mg tablets.

Table 15: Overview of studies for first line treatment of multiple myeloma 
Rajkumar 2010: Lenalidomide plus high-dose dexamethasone versus lenalidomide plus low-
dose dexamethasone as initial therapy for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma: an open-
label randomised controlled trial.  
 Patients were eligible if they had previously untreated symptomatic multiple myeloma, bone marrow 
plasmacytosis (≥10% plasma cells or sheets of plasma cells) or a biopsy proven plasmacytoma, and 
measurable disease defined as serum monoclonal protein of more than 10 g/L or urine monoclonal 
protein of > 0.2 g per day. Patients were enrolled between 2004 and 2006.  
The study was open-label. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive lenalidomide + high dose 
dexamethasone or lenalidomide + low-dose dexamethasone. The high dose regimen consisted of oral 
lenalidomide 25 mg daily days 1-21 plus oral dexamethasone 40 mg daily on days 1-4, 9-12, and 17-
20 of each 28 day cycle. The low dose regimen differed in that dexamethasone was given only on days 
1, 8, 15 and 22. After the first 4 cycles, patients could discontinue therapy to pursue stem cell 
transplantation (or other treatment options) or continue with study treatment until progression. 
Bisphosphonate treatment and thromboprophylaxis was also recommended. If patients progressed or 
did not respond during the first 4 treatment cycles, thalidomide was substituted for lenalidomide.  
The primary purpose of this study was to determine if lenalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone had 
a response rate that was not inferior to lenalidomide plus high-dose dexamethasone, while reducing 
toxicity. 
The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR) in the first 4 cycles among eligible patients. 
Additional endpoints included best overall response, time to progression (TTP), progression-free 
survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). The response and progression criteria used were standard

European Group for Blood and Bone Marrow Transplant (Bladé) criteria. Patients were also classified as 
having a very good partial response with the International Myeloma Working Group response criteria.  
223 patients were randomly assigned to receive lenalidomide plus high-dose dexamethasone and 222 
to receive lenalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone. 214 patients in the high-dose group were 
eligible for analysis, compared to 208 in the low dose group. Because the study was designed as an 
induction trial and patients were allowed to go off-study to pursue autologous stem-cell 
transplantation, 167 patients interrupted or stopped treatment to have stem-cell harvest. Of these 
patients, 163 (98%) were successful and four (2%) were unsuccessful. 
67% of patients in the high-dose group had bone disease at baseline compared with 57% in the low-
dose group. The groups were balanced with regard to age (median 66 years in high dose group vs. 65 
years in low dose group), gender, race, stage and performance status.  
169 (79%) of 214 patients receiving high-dose therapy and 142 (68%) of 205 patients on low-dose 
therapy had complete or partial response within four cycles (odds ratio 1·75, 80% CI 1·30–2·32; 
p=0·008). However, at the second interim analysis at 1 year, OS was 96% (95% CI 94–99%) in the 
low-dose dexamethasone group compared with 87% (82–92%) in the high-dose group (p=0·0002). As 
a result, the trial was stopped and patients on high-dose therapy were crossed over to low-dose 
therapy. 
52% of patients on the high-dose regimen had grade 3 or worse toxic effects in the first 4 months, 
compared with 35% on the low-dose regimen for whom toxicity data were available (p=0·0001). The 
three most common grade 3 or higher toxicities, all more common in the high dose group, were:  
deep-vein thrombosis, infections including pneumonia, and fatigue. Twelve patients on high dose 
treatment died in the first 4 months, compared to one on low dose.   
Zonder 2010: Lenalidomide and high-dose dexamethasone compared with dexamethasone 
as initial therapy for multiple myeloma: a randomized Southwest Oncology Group trial 
(S0232).  
The study included patients with untreated multiple myeloma who were ineligible or who had opted not 
to have bone marrow transplantation. Patients had to have symptomatic disease with measurable M-
protein.  
Patients were randomised 1:1 to either lenalidomide and dexamethasone or dexamethasone and 
placebo. Induction therapy consisted of three 35 day cycles of dexamethasone on days 1-4, 9-12 and 
17-20 plus lenalidomide 25 mg daily for 28 days or placebo. Maintenance therapy consisted of 
dexamethasone 40 mg daily on days 1-4 and 15-18 plus lenalidomide 25 mg daily for 21 days (or 
placebo) in repeating 28 day cycles. Both treatment arms were continued until disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity. Upon disease progression, patients on dexamethasone alone could cross over to 
open-label lenalidomide +dexamethasone.   
The stated primary objective was to compare PFS between the treatment groups. Other endpoints 
were ORR, OS and toxicity.  
The Data and Safety Monitoring Committee recommended early study closure, after enrolment of 198 
patients. This was based on inferior efficacy of dexamethasone only, and concern over the safety of 
lenalidomide in conjunction with dexamethasone in excess of 40 mg weekly.   
The combination of lenalidomide and dexamethasone was associated with improved 1 year PFS, 3 year 
PFS, and ORR (partial or better) compared to dexamethasone alone. There was a trend towards 
improved OS measured at 1, 2 and 3 years survival for lenalidomide and dexamethasone compared to 
dexamethasone alone. However this was not statistically significant.

Harousseau  2010 : Bortezomib Plus Dexamethasone Is Superior to Vincristine Plus 
Doxorubicin Plus Dexamethasone As Induction Treatment Prior to Autologous Stem-Cell 
Transplantation in Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma: Results of the IFM 2005-01 Phase 
III Trial. 
Patients less than 65 years with untreated symptomatic multiple myeloma, and measurable 
paraprotein in serum (>10g/L) or urine (>0.2g/24 hours), were enrolled.  
 The study was open-label. Patients were randomised (1:1:1:1) to receive: 
• 
vincristine + doxorubicin + dexamethasone (VAD) 
•  VAD + dexamethasone, cyclophosphamide, etoposide and cisplatin (DCEP) consolidation 
• 
• 
bortezomib plus dexamethasone (bordex) 
bordex plus DCEP consolidation 
Dexamethasone was given as a 40 mg daily oral dose. VAD was given as four 28 day cycles 
(dexamethasone days 1-4 all cycles, days 9-12 and 17-20 cycles 1 and 2). Bordex was given as four 
21-day cycles (dexamethasone days 1-4 all cycles, days 9-12 cycles 1 and 2). DCEP was given as two 
4-week cycles (dexamethasone days 1-4).  
The objective was to compare the efficacy and safety of VAD and bordex as induction therapy before 
HDT-ASCT.  
The primary endpoint was post induction CR/nCR rate. Secondary end points included post induction 
ORR, CR/nCR rate with and without DCEP consolidation, CR/nCR and at least VGPR rates post first 
transplantation, proportions of patients requiring a second transplantation, and safety and toxicity of 
induction. Response assessments were confirmed by an independent review committee.  
482 patients were randomly assigned to the 4 treatment arms. No significant differences were 
observed between groups. Median age in all groups was 57 years.  
Post-induction CR/nCR rate was significantly higher following induction with bordex versus VAD (14.8% 
v 6.4%; P = 0.004). Similarly, at least VGPR (37.7% v 15.1%; P < .001) and overall response rates 
(78.5% v 62.8%) were significantly higher. The addition of DCEP did not improve response rates. Post 
first transplantation, Cr/nCR and at least VGPR rates remained significantly higher with bordex. Median 
progression-free survival (PFS) was 36.0 months for bordex versus 29.7 months for VAD (P=0.064). 
Respective 3-year survival rates were 81.4% and 77.4%. 
Haematological toxicity grades 3 and 4 were more common in the VAD group, including seven deaths 
(2.9%) compared to none in the bortezomib plus dexamethasone group. During induction, 
consolidation, and first transplantation, peripheral neuropathy was reported in 32.2% and 52.7% of 
patients who received VAD and bordex respectively. 
THAL-MM-003: A multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, double blind, placebo-controlled 
study of combination thalidomide plus dexamethasone therapy versus dexamethasone 
therapy alone as induction therapy for previously untreated subjects with multiple 
myeloma.  
The applicant has provided a full clinical study report (dated 15 December 2006), with the consent of 
the sponsor (Celgene Europe Limited). 
Subjects were > 18 years, with a diagnosis of active multiple myeloma (Durie-Salmon Stage II or III) 
not previously treated with anti-myeloma systemic therapy, and measurable levels of myeloma 
paraprotein in serum (≥ 1.0 g/dL) or urine (≥ 0.2 g/24-hour). 436 subjects were planned.

Study treatment was randomly allocated 1:1. Treatments were given in 28-day cycles. Thalidomide (or 
placebo) was given as 50 mg capsules to be taken daily orally at bedtime. If tolerated with < Grade 2 
toxicities, this dose could be escalated to a maximum of 200mg once daily. The dexathasone dose was 
40 mg orally per day. Dexamethasone was to be taken on Days 1 to 4, 9 to 12, and 17 to 20 of each 
cycle for cycles 1 to 4; and starting at cycle 5, only for the first 4 days of each cycle. Subjects 
experiencing toxicities related to dexamethasone dosing could have their dose modified to 40 mg once 
daily for 4 days every 2 weeks, then 4 days every 4 weeks, and finally 20 mg daily for 4 days every 4 
weeks. Subjects were treated with bisphosphonates. The treatment regimen was continued until 
disease progression.  
The primary objective was to compare the efficacy of a combination of oral thalidomide plus oral 
dexamethasone (thaldex) with oral dexamethasone alone as induction therapy for subjects with active 
multiple myeloma. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was time to disease progression as determined by the Response Review 
Committee based on Bladé criteria. Secondary endpoints were PFS, response rate, duration of 
response, time to first symptomatic skeletal-related event, and OS. 
Subjects were stratified at time of randomisation by age, ECOG performance status score, and baseline 
serum beta-2 microglobulin (β2M) level.  
In total, 470 subjects were randomised. A total of 431 (91.7%) subjects met all eligibility criteria, were 
evaluated after at least 1 dose of study drug, and had no important protocol deviations. These subjects 
comprised the efficacy-evaluable population.  
The median age was 65 years in the thadex group compared to 66 years in the 
placebo/dexamethasone  group. Other characteristics were also well-matched between treatment 
groups.  
The median TTP was 97.7 weeks in the thaldex group compared with 28.3 weeks in the 
placebo/dexamethasone treatment group (HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.32-0.58, p<0.0001). The median PFS 
was 64.4 weeks in the thaldex group compared with 28.0 weeks in the placebo/dexamethasone group 
(HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.64, p<0.0001). The overall response, defined as the highest response 
achieved during the treatment phase that was either a complete or partial response, was higher in the 
thaldex group (63.0% v. 46.0%; p=0.0003). 7.7% subjects in the thaldex group exhibited a complete 
response compared with 2.6% subjects in the placebo/dexamethasone treatment group. The thaldex 
group had a statistically significant prolongation of myeloma response compared with the 
placebo/dexamethasone group (HR 0.41, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.59, p<0.0001). The median overall 
survival time from randomization was not reached in the thaldex group and was 128.6 weeks in the 
placebo/dexamethasone group. 
Cavo 2010: Bortezomib with thalidomide plus dexamethasone compared with thalidomide 
plus dexamethasone as induction therapy before, and consolidation therapy after, double 
autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma: a 
randomised phase 3 study.  
Patients were aged 18-65 with previously untreated symptomatic multiple myeloma were enrolled.  
The study was open-label. Patients were randomised 1:1 to receive three 21-day cycles of thalidomide 
(100mg daily for first 14 days, then 200mg daily) plus dexamethasone (40 mg daily on 8 of the first 
12 days) (TD), either alone or in combination with bortezomib (1.3mg/m2 on days 1,4,8 and 11) 
(VTD). Randomisation was stratified by disease stage. After double ASCT, patients received two 35-day 
cycles of their assigned drug regimen, VTD or TD, as consolidation therapy. Between the two ASCT 
procedures, all patients received 100mg thalidomide daily, and dexamethasone 40 mg daily on days 1-
4, every 28 days. Following the consolidation therapy, all patients received maintenance therapy with

dexamethasone 40 mg days 1-4, every 28 days. There was no planned dose reduction of the 
dexamethasone component. 
The primary objective was to assess the efficacy and safety of the addition of bortezomib to 
thalidomide and dexamethadone (VTD) versus TD alone as induction therapy before, and consolidation 
therapy after, double ASCT in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. 
The primary endpoint was the rate of complete or near complete response to induction therapy. The 
analysis was intention to treat. Secondary endpoints were rate of complete plus near complete 
response to double transplantation and subsequent consolidation therapy, time to progression or 
relapse, PFS, OS, and safety. Outcomes were independently assessed.  
The median ages were 58 years and 57 years for the VTD and TD arms respectively. Other baseline 
characteristics were balanced between treatment arms. 480 patients were enrolled and randomised.  
After induction therapy, complete or near complete response was achieved in 31% (95% CI 25·0–
36·8) receiving VTD, and 11% (95% CI 7·3–15·4) on TD (p<0·0001). The secondary outcomes were 
all in line with the primary outcome. No difference in overall survival was detected.  
Van Rhee 2010: Total Therapy 3 for multiple myeloma: prognostic implications of cumulative 
dosing and premature discontinuation of VTD maintenance components, bortezomib, 
thalidomide, and dexamethasone, relevant to all phases of therapy. 
303 newly diagnosed patients with symptomatic or progressive multiple myeloma were enrolled. Ages 
are not specified in this publication.  
Patients received Total Therapy 3 (TT3), consisting of 2 cycles of VTD-PACE (bortezomib, thalidomide, 
dexamethasone; 4-day continuous infusions of cisplatin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide) as 
induction before and, at reduced doses as consolidation after, melphalan-based tandem 
transplantation. Thalidomide and dexamethasone were given at 50 mg/day and 20 mg/day for 4 days 
every 28 days to “bridge” drug-free intervals between induction cycles, whereas thalidomide dosing 
was 100 mg/day with dexamethasone 20 mg/day for 4 days every 28 days between transplantations 
and consolidation cycles. Maintenance therapy comprised VTD in year 1 and TD in years 2 and 3. 
Endpoints included complete response (Bladé), complete response duration, event-free survival (EFS), 
overall survival, time to next treatment (TNT) and post-relapse survival (PRS). The impact of 
cumulative dosing of VTD components on OS, EFS, TNT and PRS was also investigated.  
Gene expression profiling (GEP) of CD138-enriched plasma cells was performed in a subset of 275 
patients.  
The 5-year estimates of OS and EFS were 72% and 69%, respectively. Of the 62% of patients 
achieving CR, 82% retained this status 5 years later.  
Regarding VTD dosing, OS and EFS were longer when higher doses had been delivered of all 3 agents 
during induction, of V and D in consolidation, and of D in maintenance. Given the prognostic 
implications of cumulative dosing of dexamethasone throughout all phases of therapy, the authors 
investigated whether the expression level of its target, glucocorticoid receptor gene NR3C1, impacted 
clinical outcome. NR3C1 top-tertile expression levels were linked to longer and bottom-tertile levels to 
shorter OS and EFS. Dexamethasone dosing in induction extended OS and EFS only when NR3C1 
expression was low.  
Premature drug discontinuation of bortezomib, thalidomide or dexamethasone conferred shorter EFS, 
OS and TNT in univariate models, of which bortezomib retained independent significance for OS and 
both thalidomide and dexamethasone for TNT.

Richardson 2010: Lenalidomide, bortezomib and dexamethasone combination therapy in 
patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. 
Sixty-six patients were enrolled: all were over 18 years, with previously untreated symptomatic 
multiple myeloma. The median age was 58 years (59 years for the phase 2 population).  
Patients received 3-week cycles (n =8) of bortezomib 1.0 or 1.3 mg/m2 (days 1, 4, 8, 11), 
lenalidomide 15 to 25 mg (days 1-14), and dexamethasone on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 12 (at a dose 
of 40 mg daily cycles 1-4 and 20 mg daily cycles 5-8). Responding patients proceeded to maintenance 
or transplantation. Phase 2 dosing was determined to be bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2, lenalidomide 25 mg, 
and dexamethasone 20 mg. 
The primary endpoints were to determine the MTD of bortezomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone 
(phase 1) and to evaluate the response rate (partial response or better) to the combination (phase 2). 
Secondary end points included complete plus near-complete response (CR+ nCR) rate, duration of 
response (DOR), PFS, OS, and toxicity. The rate of very good partial response (VGPR) or better was 
also determined.  
Two patients in dose level 4 (including dexamethasone 40 mg or 20mg on specified days) experienced 
DLT, specifically grade 3 hyperglycemia and grade 3 alanine transaminase elevation, both attributable 
to dexamethasone by the investigator. An additional dose level 4M (including dexamethasone 20 mg or 
10 mg)  was investigated, enrolling 6 patients per protocol; no further DLT was reported in these initial 
6 patients enrolled in phase 1 nor in the subsequent expanded phase 1 cohort, and 4M was established 
as the MTD. 
The rate of partial response was 100% in both the phase 2 population and overall, with 74% and 67% 
achieving at least a very good partial response, respectively.  
Alexanian 1992: Primary Dexamethasone Treatment of Multiple Myeloma 
This was a longitudinal single-arm study. 112 consecutive previously untreated symptomatic multiple 
myeloma patients were enrolled between 1989 and 1991. The dexamethasone dose regimen was 20 
mg/m2 each morning on days 1-4, 9-12, and 17-20. After a 14-day rest, the treatment was repeated 
with downward dose adjustments for side effects.  
Median age was 60 years. The overall response rate was 43% (criteria based on a 75% or greater 
reduction of calculated tumour mass). Response and survival data were compared with those of a VAD 
regimen studied immediately before the dexamethasone program in 177 previously untreated patients. 
In the VAD study the overall response rate was stated to be 55%. All patients responding to VAD or 
dexamethasone showed a tumour halving time of 3.2 months or less, and a remission was confirmed 
in 80% of patients within 2 months.

dexamethasone versus dexamethasone alone in previously treated subjects with multiple 
myeloma. 
The applicant has provided a full clinical study report (dated 09 December 2008), with the consent of 
the sponsor (Celgene Europe Limited).  
Subjects were enrolled from 11 Feb 2003 at 48 sites in U.S. and 4 in Canada. Inclusion criteria were 
prior or current diagnosis of Durie-Salmon stage II or III multiple myeloma and considered to have 
disease progression after at least 2 cycles of anti-myeloma treatment or to have relapsed with 
progressive disease after treatment; measurable levels of myeloma paraprotein (M-paraprotein) in 
serum (≥ 0.5 g/dL) or urine (≥ 0.2 g excreted in a 24-hour collection sample); and an ECOG 
performance status of 0, 1, or 2.   
Eligible subjects were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to lenalidomide + oral dexamethasone (lendex) or 
dexamethasone alone (dex).  
Subjects in the lendex group took 25 mg of lenalidomide orally once daily on Days 1 to 21 and a 
matching placebo capsule once daily on Days 22 to 28 of each 28-day cycle. Subjects in the dex group 
took 1 placebo capsule on Days 1 to 28 of each 28-day cycle. Subjects in both treatment groups took 
40 mg of dexamethasone orally once daily on Days 1 to 4, 9 to 12, and 17 to 20 of each 28-day cycle 
for the first 4 cycles of therapy. Beginning with Cycle 5, the dose of dexamethasone was reduced to 40 
mg orally once daily on Days 1 to 4 every 28 days for the remaining cycles. 
The dexamethasone tablets for the combination therapy were obtained commercially by the subjects 
using prescriptions provided by the investigators. 
The primary objective was to compare the efficacy of lendex with that of dex as treatment for subjects 
with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Thesecondary objective was to compare the safety of 
lendex with that of dex as treatment for subjects with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

Treatment continued until disease progression occurred or until treatment was discontinued for 
another reason. Adjustments of the lenalidomide and/or dexamethasone dose were made based on 
tolerability. The lowest allowable dose of oral dexamethasone was 20 mg daily for 4 days every 4 
weeks.  
The primary endpoint was time to progression (TTP) according to the Bladé criteria, with PFS and time 
to treatment failure as supportive analyses. Secondary endpoints included OS and myeloma response 
rate.  
Randomisation was stratified according to prognostic features. The study was conducted as double-
blind. The study was un-blinded after a pre-specified interim analysis demonstrated a treatment 
benefit in favour of the lendex combination. The study was ongoing (6 subjects in Canada) on the date 
of the study report. Data cut-off for primary analysis was 07 June 2005. Data cut-off for extended 
follow-up for survival was 23 Jul 2008.  
The median age in the lendex and dex was 64.0 and 62.0 years respectively. A higher proportion of 
subjects in the lendex group (80.8%) than in the dex group (70.5%) had received prior therapy with 
dexamethasone (p = 0.026). 353 subjects were enrolled and analysed.  
The median TTP was 60.1 weeks in the lendex group and 20.1 weeks in the dex group (p<0.001). At 
data cut-off for the interim analysis, 20.9% of patients in the lendex group had died compared to 
34.1% in the dex, a statistically significant difference. Results of analysis of other secondary efficacy 
endpoints supported the primary efficacy outcome.

The applicant has provided a full clinical study report (dated 09 December 2008), with the consent of 
the sponsor (Celgene Europe Limited).  This protocol is virtually identical to MM-009 above, except that 
participants were from outside U.S. 
Subjects were enrolled from 22 Sep 2003 at 55 sites in Australia, Europe and Israel. Inclusion criteria 
were prior or current diagnosis of Durie-Salmon stage II or III multiple myeloma and considered to 
have disease progression after at least 2 cycles of antimyeloma treatment or to have relapsed with 
progressive disease after treatment; measurable levels of myeloma paraprotein (M-paraprotein) in 
serum (≥ 0.5 g/dL) or urine (≥ 0.2 g excreted in a 24-hour collection sample); and an ECOG 
performance status of 0, 1, or 2.   
Eligible subjects were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to lendex or dex alone. Subjects in the lendex group 
took 25 mg of lenalidomide orally once daily on Days 1 to 21 and a matching placebo capsule once 
daily on Days 22 to 28 of each 28-day cycle. Subjects in the dex group took 1 placebo capsule on Days 
1 to 28 of each 28-day cycle. Subjects in both treatment groups took 40 mg of dexamethasone orally 
once daily on Days 1 to 4, 9 to 12, and 17 to 20 of each 28-day cycle for the first 4 cycles of therapy. 
Beginning with Cycle 5, the dose of dexamethasone was reduced to 40 mg orally once daily on Days 1 
to 4 every 28 days for the remaining cycles. 
Treatment continued until disease progression occurred or until treatment was discontinued for 
another reason. Adjustments were made in the lenalidomide and/or dexamethasone dose for each 
subject based on tolerability. The lowest allowable dose of oral dexamethasone was 20 mg daily for 4 
days every 4 weeks.

The primary objective was to compare the efficacy of lendex with that of dex as treatment for subjects 
with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. The secondary objective was to compare the safety of 
lendex with that of dex as treatment for subjects with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. 
The primary endpoint was time to progression (TTP) according to the Bladé criteria, with PFS and time

Subjects were enrolled from 18 March 2011 at 68 sites in Europe, 10 sites in Australia, 10 sites in 
Canada, 4 sites in Russia and one site in U.S. Eligible subjects had either refractory, or relapsed and 
refractory disease defined as documented disease progression during or within 60 days of completing 
their last multiple myeloma therapy. All subjects must have failed both lenalidomide and bortezomib. 
ECOG performance score had to be 0, 1 or 2.    
Eligible subjects were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to pomalidomide + low dose oral dexamethasone (Pom 
+ LD-dex) or high dose dexamethasone alone (HD-dex).  
Subjects in the Pom + LD-dex group took 4 mg of pomalidomide orally once daily on Days 1 to 21 and 
dexamethasone 40 mg on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 28-day cycle. Subjects in the HD-dex group took 
40 mg of dexamethasone orally once daily on Days 1 to 4, 9 to 12, and 17 to 20 of each 28-day cycle. 
(Patients > 75 years of age in either treatment arm received dexamethasone 20 mg).   
Treatment continued until disease progression. For subjects in the HD-dex arm whose disease 
progressed, the option was given to enrol in a companion study to receive pomalidomide alone.  
The Sponsor provided commercial supplies of dexamethasone 2 mg and 4 mg tablets for oral 
administration.  
The primary objective was to compare the efficacy of Pom + LD-dex with that of HD-Dex in subjects 
with refractory or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.  The secondary objective was to compare 
the safety of Pom + LD-dex with that of HD-Dex in subjects with refractory or relapsed and refractory 
multiple myeloma.

The primary endpoint was PFS by blinded central review. The study was also powered to show an 
advantage in OS.   
Randomisation was stratified according to prognostic features.  
Data cut-off for primary analysis was 07 Sep 2012. Data cut-off for extended follow-up for survival was 
01 Mar 2013. The majority of patients were male (58.9%) and white (78.5%). The median age was 64 
years.  
455 subjects were enrolled and analysed (ITT population), 302 in Pom + LD-dex arm and 153 in HD-
Dex arm.   The final PFS analysis was based on 267 events and was performed with a data cut-off of 
07 Sep 2012. Median PFS was 15.7 weeks in the Pom + LD-dex arm compared to 8.0 weeks in the HD-
Dex arm. The hazard ratio was 0.49 (95% CI: 0.39, 0.61). At 01 Mar 2013, the median OS was 54.0 
weeks for the Pom + HD-dex arm, compared to 34.9 weeks for the HD-dex arm. The hazard ratio was 
0.70 (95% CI: 0.54, 0.92).  
Based on the PFS results and interim OS analysis, the DMC recommended study completion and cross-
over of subjects from the HD-dex arm to the Pom + LD-dex arm.  
Kobayashi 2010: Bortezomib plus dexamethasone for relapsed or treatment refractory 
multiple myeloma: the collaborative study at six institutes in Kyoto and Osaka 
This is a retrospective observational cohort study investigating the efficacy and safety of patients with 
relapsed or refractory myeloma who had received bortezomib and dexamethasone (BD) therapy.  
88 patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma were treated with BD at 6 independent 
institutions in Kyoto and Osaka between 2003 and 2009. At least one cycle was administered to all 88 
patients.  
Bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2/day) was intravenously administered on days 1, 4, 8 and 11, and 
dexamethasone (20 or 40 mg/day) was administered on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11 and 12, with a 10-
day rest period every 21 days. The dose of dexamethasone was reduced to 2–16 mg/day in 38 
patients who previously experienced Grade 3 corticosteroid-related AEs, such as fluid retention, 
hyperglycemia, psychiatric disorders, or corticosteroid withdrawal symptoms. 
Response was assessed using the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria. PFS and OS 
were also measured. Factors in bortezomib and dexamethasone treatment suspected of having an 
effect on OS and PFS were analyzed by means of univariate analyses using log-rank tests.  
Median age was 68 years. The median daily dose of Dexamethasone was 20 mg/day (range 2–40 
mg/day). Overall ORR (CR + VGPR + PR) was 67.0%. The median OS was 510 days, and the 
estimated OS at 2 years was 41.4%, while the corresponding values for PFS were 113 days and 
14.4%. Dexamethasone over 20 mg per day was associated with improved overall survival.  
Palumbo 2001: Low-dose thalidomide plus dexamethasone is an effective salvage therapy 
for advanced myeloma 
This was a prospective single arm study.  
Between June 1999 and August 2000, 77 consecutive patients with refractory or relapsed myeloma 
were enrolled. At the time of treatment, all patients had progressive disease with a >50% increase in 
myeloma protein or reappearance of Bence Jones proteinuria >0.5 g/24h. 
Thalidomide 100 mg daily was administered daily, in combination with dexamethasone on days 1 to 4 
every month.  
41% showed a myeloma protein decline >50%: in 18% the decline was 75-100%, in 23% it was 50-
75%, and in 25% it was 25-50%. 3% showed complete remission.

Von Lilenfeld-Toal 2008: A systematic review of phase II trials of 
thalidomide⁄dexamethasone combination therapy in patients with relapsed or refractory 
multiple myeloma. 
All trials published in the English language that evaluated combination therapy with thalidomide and 
dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and had a clear definition of 
complete (CR) and partial remission (PR) were included. Trials were excluded if they reported only on 
patients with plasma cell leukaemia, solitary or extramedullary plasmocytoma. 
12 studies, including a total of 451 patients, entered the final analysis. Most studies were single centre 
phase 2; there were no randomised controlled trials. Publication date was between 2000 and 2007. 
Median age was 63 years.  
Dexamethasone regimens varied: 40 mg daily for days 1–4 every month in four studies (181 patients), 
40 mg daily or 20 mg⁄ m2 ⁄ day for days 1–4 every 3 weeks in three studies (66 patients), 12 mg 
daily days 1–4 every 3 weeks in one study (12 patients) and 20 mg⁄ m2 days 1–5 every 15 days (47 
patients). In two studies with 79 patients, the dexamethasone dose (40 mg daily days 1–4 or 20 
mg⁄ m2 ⁄ day) was repeated weekly or biweekly in the beginning of the treatment and then reduced 
to a monthly schedule. One study (n = 66) investigated 4 mg daily dexamethasone in the first month 
with a quick tapering of 1 mg⁄  day ⁄ week to a maintenance dose of 1 mg daily. There was no 
significant effect of dose intensity of dexamethasone on the response rate (P = 0.3). 
Various criteria were used to evaluate response. The median remission rate (CR/PR) was 46% (95% CI 
42-51%).  
Garderet 2012: Superiority of the Triple Combination of Bortezomib-Thalidomide-
Dexamethasone Over the Dual Combination of Thalidomide-Dexamethasone in Patients With 
Multiple Myeloma Progressing or Relapsing After Autologous Transplantation: The 
MMVAR/IFM 2005-04 Randomized Phase III Trial From the Chronic Leukemia Working Party 
of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation 
Between 2006 and 2010, Patients with confirmed multiple myeloma and measurable disease were 
eligible if they had progressed or relapsed after at least one ASCT and provided it was their first 
progression or relapse. 269 patients were enrolled from 69 centres.  
The study was open-label. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2 
intravenous bolus) or no bortezomib for 1 year, in combination with thalidomide (200 mg per day 
orally) and dexamethasone (40 mg orally once a day on 4 days once every 3 weeks). Bortezomib was 
administered on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 with a 10-day rest period (day 12 to day 21) for eight cycles (6 
months), and then on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 with a 20-day rest period (day 23 to day 42) for four 
cycles (6 months). Antithrombotic prophylaxis was mandatory in both arms. No crossover from the TD 
to the VTD arm was permitted.   
This prospective phase III study compared the efficacy and safety of VTD versus TD in patients with 
multiple myeloma progressing or relapsing after ASCT. 
The primary end point was TTP, defined as the interval from random assignment to disease 
progression, and was assessed on the intent-to-treat population. Secondary end points included PFS, 
OS, overall response rate (CR+PR), and safety. Progression and response were determined according 
to EBMT criteria.  
Randomisation was stratified by number of previous ASCTs.  
Baseline demographic data were well-balanced between treatment arms. Median age was 60 years and 
62.6 years in the VTD and TD arms respectively.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/6613/2016

No enrolled patients were excluded from the analysis.  
Median time to progression was significantly longer with VTD than TD (19.5 vs 13.8 months; hazard 
ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.80; p =0.001), the complete response plus near-complete response rate 
was higher (45% vs 25%; p=0.001), and the median duration of response was longer (17.2 vs 13.4 
months; P=0.03).  
The percentage of patients receiving planned doses of dexamethasone was 78.9% when randomly 
assigned to VTD therapy and 76.7% when randomly assigned to TD.  
The most clinically significant AE was peripheral sensory neuropathy (grade 3), which occurred in 29% 
of patients on VTD and 12% on TD. Thromboembolic events were rare: five cases versus 10 cases of 
deep vein thrombosis and five cases versus two cases of pulmonary embolism for VTD versus TD.   
Richardson 2009: Multicenter, phase I, dose-escalation trial of lenalidomide plus bortezomib 
for relapsed and relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.  
38 patients aged > 18 years with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma were enrolled across 6 dose 
cohorts. Median age was 59 years.  
Patients received lenalidomide 5, 10, or 15 mg daily on days 1-14 and received bortezomib 1.0 or 1.3 
mg/m2 on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of 21-day cycles. Dexamethasone (20mg or 40 mg on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 
8, 9, 11, and 12 at the investigator’s discretion) was added for progressive disease after two cycles. 
Dexamethasone dose could be reduced for attributable toxicity.  
The primary objective was to evaluate safety and determine the MTD of lenalidomide + bortezomib in 
patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.  
The MTD was lenalidomide 15 mg/ daily plus bortezomib 1.0 mg/m2. Among 36 response-evaluable 
patients, 61% (90% CI, 46% to 75%) achieved minimal response or better. Among 18 patients who 
had dexamethasone added (for progressive disease after two cycles), 83% (90% CI, 62% to 95%) 
achieved stable disease or better. 6 patients required dexamethasone dose reduction. To date, 13 of 
the 18 patients who received dexamethasone have subsequently experienced progression, and the 
median TTP was 6.1 months (95% CI, 2.7% to 14.6%) from the time of dexamethasone addition. 
Supportive study 
The applicant has submitted a patient questionnaire survey on high dose dexamethasone for subjects 
suffering from multiple myeloma (40 mg tablets).  
The objective of the questionnaire was to evaluate the relevance of a new 40 mg dexamethasone 
tablet formation for high dose regimen for the treatment of patients suffering from multiple myeloma.  
This was a cross-sectional survey using a postal questionnaire. The study participants were all 
members of a French patients organisation (Association Française des Maladies du Myélome Multiple). 
All 600 members of the organisation were sent a questionnaire with a covering letter. Questions 
covered tolerance (of current or most recent dexamethasone treatment), formulation and dose. 
Tolerance included questions regarding convenience, acceptability, preference and ease of 
dexamethasone regimen.  
Of the 600 questionnaires sent, 282 responses were received, of which 260 were analysed (22 
questionnaires did not contain any information regarding dexamethasone). The respondents were 136 
male, 119 female. The median age was 65 years. 36% were taking dexamethasone currently. 49% 
and 17% of patients took one or half a tablet of dexamethasone per administration respectively. The 
remainder either took large numbers of tablets, or non-tablet formulations. 61% took 40 mg per 
administration; 33% took 20 mg per administration.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/6613/2016 
Page 44/61 
 
 
  
The highest acceptability score was associated with taking one tablet per administration (mean score 
2.54 out of possible 3.0). The lowest score was associated with taking 80 tablets per administration 
(mean score 0.29). Around half of respondents answered a question regarding compliance changes 
associated with taking one tablet per administration, of which 44% thought compliance would improve, 
and 55% thought compliance would not change.  However 78% of respondents would wish to receive 
one tablet per administration.

Neofordex (dexamethasone) 40 mg scored tablet was granted a cohort Temporary Authorisation for 
Use (ATU) in France on 19 April 2010 in the following indications:  
‘Neofordex 40 mg is indicated as combination therapy for the treatment of certain forms of multiple 
myeloma, lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in adults.’ 
The applicant has provided post-marketing data. 12,141 patients with multiple myeloma have been 
exposed to Neofordex. Since the start of the ATU, 75 reports of adverse reactions have been collected. 
No amendments to section 4.8 of the SmPC are required in light of the reports received under the ATU. 
2.4.6.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The applicant has submitted data from study CPA 402-11, a single dose bioequivalence study in fasted 
healthy volunteers. The bioavailability of Neofordex 40 mg tablets is comparable to that of the 
reference product Dectancyl 0.5 mg tablets (Sanofi-Aventis France, France), as measured by AUC0-36. 
The Cmax of Neofordex 40 mg tablets is significantly lower than that of Dectancyl 0.5 mg tablets. The 
applicant has provided relevant non-clinical in vitro data to support the low relevance of the Cmax 
value in the clinical efficacy of dexamethasone in multiple myeloma treatment. The extrapolation of 
this non-clinical data to the clinical situation is considered acceptable. The pharmacokinetic study CC-
5013-MM-017-PK provides some data relevant to the target population at the proposed daily dose 
level. AUCt and Cmax after a single dose (day 2) are in line with the values observed for the reference 
product in the bioequivalence study CPA 402-11 in healthy volunteers, when dose-adjusted. The half-
life is also comparable.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/6613/2016

The applicant has submitted clinical study reports from the literature, which include dexamethasone in 
various treatment combinations, or as a single-agent comparator, for previously untreated, or 
relapsed/refractory, multiple myeloma.  Overall, the populations studied, which included a wide range 
of ages, as well as patients considered eligible or ineligible for ASCT, adequately reflect the proposed 
population of ‘symptomatic multiple myeloma’. A wide range of combinations are investigated, 
including the newer immunomodulatory drugs and protease inhibitor, as well as more established 
cytotoxics. There is little evidence for the specific contribution of dexamethasone to efficacy, over and 
above some observed response outcomes in dexamethasone-only arms, or some suggestion of dose 
response. However, taken as a whole, the submitted literature provided evidence that dexamethasone, 
dosed at 20 mg or 40 mg daily, as pulse therapy, is an established therapy in the first line and 
relapsed / refractory settings.   
Based on the literature data submitted, 40 mg once daily, administered as pulse therapy is widely 
used. However regimens using a 20 mg once daily dose are also recommended e.g. an attenuated 
regimen of cyclophosphamide, thalidomide and dexamethasone or CTDa (Ludwig et al 2012). The 
applicant has justified the advice to consider a dose of 20 mg daily in the elderly or frail patient based 
on expert consensus that 20 mg should be used in patients over 75 years (Dimopoulos 2011).  
In addition, the applicant has conducted a questionnaire survey on high-dose oral dexamethasone 
(i.e., 40 mg daily doses, or 20 mg for elderly and/or frail patients) for subjects suffering from multiple 
myeloma in order to show the importance of a suitable dosage forms from a patient perspective. 
In elderly and/or frail patients, the daily dose may be reduced to 20 mg of dexamethasone, according 
to the appropriate treatment regimen (SmPC, section 4.2). 
Tablets may be broken in two equal halves using the score line to provide the 20 mg dose. Due to 
possible stability issues affecting half tablets stored after division, half-tablets that are not taken 
immediately should be discarded in agreement with local precautions for environmental protection 
(SmPC, section 4.2). 
In order to eliminate the need to break the tablets if a 20 mg dose is prescribed, the Applicant 
commits to submit a marketing authorisation application (MAA) for 20 mg oral dosage form with an 
indication in MM. 
A variation application to remove the score line should be submitted within 12 months of the first 
approval of a marketing authorisation for the 20 mg oral dosage form (see Risk Management Plan). 
From the submitted data, 1958 patients with multiple myeloma, newly diagnosed or 
relapsed/refractory, were exposed to dexamethasone during clinical studies. The applicant has also 
submitted data from the Neofordex compassionate use programme set up in France: 12,141 patients 
with multiple myeloma received at least one dose of Neofordex.  
The applicant has provided a description of the frequency of adverse events reported by multiple 
myeloma patients using mainly 40 mg daily as pulse therapy. This supplements the well-known safety 
profile of dexamethasone, for the purposes of the product information. In addition, the applicant has 
provided a summary of adverse reactions that have been observed more frequently and/or severely in 
treatment combinations including dexamethasone. The applicant’s table of adverse reactions (ADRs) 
includes most of the ADRs listed for the reference product SmPC, and other EU marketed 
dexamethasone products. Additional ADRs are included, and frequencies of known ADRs upgraded, on 
the basis of the submitted safety data from dexamethasone only arms of submitted studies. This 
approach is endorsed and the updated frequencies are agreed. Some preferred terms have been 
grouped for the purposes of the SmPC. This is acceptable.

The applicant has highlighted serious adverse events which were reported in the submitted literature 
studies but which were not included in the reference product SmPC. The SmPC section 4.8 adequately 
describes the serious adverse events and deaths reported in the submitted literature. A specific 
warning regarding the risk of pneumonia has been included in Section 4.4 of the SmPC.  
Haematological findings from the submitted literature data are adequately discussed by the applicant, 
and the SmPC updated accordingly. 
The common adverse reactions to systemic corticosteroids may be associated with more serious 
consequences in old age, especially osteoporosis, hypertension, hypokalaemia, diabetes, susceptibility 
to infection and thinning of the skin. Close clinical supervision is required to avoid life-threatening 
reactions (SmPC, section 4.4). 
No new data is submitted concerning the use of dexamethasone in pregnancy.  
Based on human experience, dexamethasone is suggested to cause congenital malformations, 
particularly intra-uterine growth retardation and rarely neonatal adrenal insufficiency, when 
administered during pregnancy. Neofordex should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical 
condition of the woman requires treatment with dexamethasone (SmPC section 4.6). 
Glucocorticoids are excreted in human milk and effects have been shown in breastfed newborns/infants 
of treated women. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to 
discontinue/abstain from Neofordex therapy taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for the 
child and the benefit of therapy for the woman (SmPC, section 4.6). 
Dexamethasone has been used for many years in Europe for a wide-range of indications, and its safety 
profile is well known. The submitted publications provide additional safety data at high dose, for the 
symptomatic multiple myeloma population, and in combination with other medicinal products.  
2.4.7.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
Pharmacokinetic comparability with the reference product has been demonstrated. A summary of the 
literature with regard to clinical data of dexamethasone was provided and was accepted by the CHMP. 
This is in accordance with the relevant guideline and additional clinical studies were not considered 
necessary. 
2.5.  Pharmacovigilance

PSUR submission 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
2.6.  Product information 
2.6.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
3.  Benefit-risk balance  
This application concerns a hybrid version of dexamethasone 40 mg tablets. The reference product 
Dectancyl, is indicated in combination with various types of chemotherapy for the treatment of 
lymphoid malignancies. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/6613/2016 
Page 52/61 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Nonclinical studies have been provided for this application and considered sufficient. From a clinical 
perspective, this application contains new data on the pharmacokinetics of the active substance; the 
applicant’s clinical overview on efficacy and safety clinical aspects based on information from published 
literature was considered sufficient. 
The bioequivalence study forms the pivotal basis with a with cross-over design under fasting 
conditions. The study design was considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this 
formulation and was in line with the respective European requirements. Choice of dose, sampling 
points, overall sampling times as well as wash-out period were adequate. The analytical method was 
validated. Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were adequate. 
The bioavailability of Neofordex 40 mg tablets is comparable to that of the reference product Dectancyl 
0.5 mg tablets (Sanofi-Aventis France, France), as measured by AUC0-36. The Cmax of Neofordex 40 
mg tablets is significantly lower than that of Dectancyl 0.5 mg tablets. The applicant has provided 
relevant non-clinical in vitro data to support the low relevance of the Cmax value in the clinical efficacy 
of dexamethasone in multiple myeloma treatment. The extrapolation of this non-clinical data to the 
clinical situation is considered acceptable. 
A positive benefit/risk ratio can therefore be concluded. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen 
reference medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are 
required beyond those included in the product information. 
In order to eliminate the need to break the tablets if a 20 mg dose is prescribed, the Applicant 
commits to submit a marketing authorisation application (MAA) for 20 mg oral dosage form with an 
indication in MM. 
A variation application to remove the tablet score line should be submitted within 12 months of the 
first approval of a marketing authorisation for the 20 mg oral dosage form (see Risk Management 
Plan). 
4.  Recommendation 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Neofordex is not similar to Revlimid, Thalidomide 
Celgene, Imnovid, Farydak and Kyprolis within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) 
No. 847/200. See Appendix 1. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by majority 
decision that the benefit-risk balance of Neofordex in the treatment of symptomatic multiple myeloma 
in combination with other medicinal products is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of 
the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:

Divergent position 
The undersigned members of the CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s positive opinion recommending 
the 20 mg posology in elderly and/or frail patients. 
The SmPC includes a 20 mg posology which requires halving a 40 mg tablet. The unused unpackaged 
tablet half requires to be discarded as there is no approved in-use stability period for this product. In 
order to protect the environment, unused tablet halves will need to be stored until they can be 
disposed of appropriately. This practice raises a number of issues. There is a risk that tablet halves will 
be taken subsequently, with a potential reduction in efficacy. In addition, unused tablet halves may not 
be stored out of the sight and reach of children.    
The RMP includes medication error related to administration of the 20 mg dose as an important 
potential risk. Consequently, the applicant is requested to develop a 20 mg oral dosage form to 
supplement Neofordex 40 mg Tablets. Upon authorisation of the 20 mg strength oral dosage form, the 
applicant is requested to remove the score line for sub-division of the 40 mg tablet, and delete the 20 
mg posology. These post-authorisation measures are classified as ‘RMP’.  
In order to fulfil the PAMs, the Applicant plans to gain approval for a dexamethasone 20 mg / 5 ml oral 
solution via the decentralised procedure.  The oral solution will contain dexamethasone sodium 
phosphate, a different ester form to that of the Neofordex Tablet, which contains dexamethasone 
acetate. The applicant estimates that it could take up to 29 months for the 20 mg oral dosage form to 
be available in all relevant member states. It will then take a minimum of 6 months to remove the 
score line from the 40 mg tablet. Therefore it could be 3 years before the score line is removed and 
the 20 mg posology deleted.  
The undersigned members of the CHMP believe that the risks associated with halving tablets, in the 
context of a formulation without in-use stability for the remaining tablet, and the approximate 3-year 
timeframe to remove the scoreline based on availability of a more suitable formulation outweigh the 
uncertain benefits of this formulation in terms of patient convenience. The 20 mg posology should be 
deleted prior to approval, and the score line should be removed prior to marketing.

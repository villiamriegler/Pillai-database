4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
PreHevbri is indicated for active immunisation against infection caused by all known subtypes of the 
hepatitis B virus in adults.  
It can be expected that hepatitis D will also be prevented by immunisation with PreHevbri as 
hepatitis D (caused by the delta agent) does not occur in the absence of hepatitis B infection. 
The use of PreHevbri should be in accordance with official recommendations. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Vaccination schedule 
The vaccination schedule consists of 3 doses (1 mL each) given according to the following schedule: 
first dose at an elected date; second dose 1 month after the first dose; third dose 6 months after the first 
dose.  
Booster dose 
The need for a booster dose has not been established. No data are available. 
Elderly population 
No dose adjustments are required in elderly persons aged 65 years and older (see section 5.1).

Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of PreHevbri in children have not yet been established. Limited data are 
available. 
Method of administration  
PreHevbri should be injected intramuscularly (IM) into the deltoid region.   
Do not inject intravascularly, subcutaneously or intradermally. 
For instructions on handling of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
History of severe allergic reaction, such as anaphylaxis, after a previous dose of any hepatitis B 
vaccine. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision must be available to 
manage possible anaphylactic reactions following administration of the vaccine.  
Vaccination should be postponed in subjects suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute 
infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low-grade fever should not delay vaccination. 
Syncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination as a psychogenic response to 
the needle injection. This can be accompanied by several neurological signs such as transient visual 
disturbance, paraesthesia, and tonic-clonic limb movements during recovery. It is important that 
procedures are in place to avoid injury. 
Hepatitis B has a long incubation period. PreHevbri may not prevent hepatitis B infection in 
individuals who have an unrecognised hepatitis B infection at the time of vaccine administration.  
As with any vaccine, a protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccinees. 
The vaccine will not prevent infection caused by other agents such as hepatitis A, hepatitis C and 
hepatitis E or other pathogens known to infect the liver.  
Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders 
As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution in subjects receiving 
anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as 
haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in 
these subjects. 
Immunodeficiency 
Immunocompromised persons may have a diminished immune response to PreHevbri. There are 
limited data available among immunocompromised population. Attention should be given to ensure 
that a protective antibody level is maintained as defined by national recommendations and guidelines. 
Patients with chronic liver disease or with HIV infection or hepatitis C carriers should not be 
precluded from vaccination against hepatitis B. The vaccine could be advised since hepatitis B 
infection can be severe in these patients: the PreHevbri vaccination should thus be considered on a 
case by case basis by the physician.

Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) derived from hepatitis B vaccines has been transiently detected 
in blood samples following vaccination. Serum HBsAg detection may not have diagnostic value 
within 28 days after administration of PreHevbri. 
Renal impairment 
Pre-haemodialysis and haemodialysis patients are at risk of exposure to hepatitis B virus and have a 
higher risk of becoming chronically infected. Attention should be given to ensure that a protective 
antibody level is achieved and maintained as defined by national recommendations and guidelines.  
Excipients with known effect 
Sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. is essentially 
'sodium-free’. 
Potassium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) per dose, i.e. is essentially 
potassium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed.  
There are no data on co-administration of PreHevbri with other vaccines. The concomitant use of 
PreHevbri with other vaccines is not recommended.  
When concomitant administration of PreHevbri and immune globulin is required, they should be given 
with different syringes at separate injection sites.  
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of the vaccine in pregnant women.  
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity 
(see section 5.3).  
Vaccination during pregnancy should only be performed if the benefit/risk ratio at individual level 
outweighs possible risks for the foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether PreHevbri is excreted in human milk. 
A risk to the breastfed newborn/infant cannot be excluded. 
A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to abstain from PreHevbri 
vaccination taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of 
vaccination for the woman. 
Fertility 
There are no data on fertility in humans from the use of PreHevbri.  
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity 
(see section 5.3).

4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
PreHevbri has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of 
the effects mentioned under section 4.8 (e.g. fatigue, headache, dizziness) may temporarily affect the 
ability to drive or operate machines. 
4.8 
Undesirable effects  
Summary of safety profile 
The clinical trial safety profile of PreHevbri is based on two Phase 3 controlled clinical trials 
(Sci-B-Vac-001 and Sci-B-Vac-002) in which 2 920 adults received at least one dose of PreHevbri.  
Local and systemic post-injection reactions were monitored using diary cards for a 7 -day period 
starting on the day of each vaccination (solicited adverse events).  
The most common solicited local reactions were injection-site pain (72.2%), tenderness (71.2%) and 
local pruritus/itching (12.2%). Most common solicited systemic reactions were myalgia (41.7%), 
fatigue (37.5%), and headache (36.3%). 
The frequency and severity of solicited adverse events generally declined or remained similar with 
successive vaccinations. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions  
The information in the table below is taken from data from the two pivotal studies and includes both 
solicited and spontaneously reported adverse reactions.  
The frequency of adverse reactions is defined as follows:  
Very common: (≥1/10)  
Common: (≥1/100 to <1/10)  
Uncommon: (≥1/1000 to <1/100)  
Rare: (≥1/10,000 to <1/1000)  
Very rare: (<1/10,000)  
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Hepatitis B vaccines, purified antigen ATC code J07BC01 
Mechanism of action 
PreHevbri contains the full antigenic composition of the hepatitis B virus surface antigen, including 
the small (S), middle (pre-S2) and large (pre-S1) hepatitis B surface antigens in a virus-like particle 
structure and confers immunity against all known subtypes of hepatitis B virus infection through the 
stimulation of a specific immune response, as measured by the induction of anti-HBs antibodies at a 
level ≥10 mIU/mL 
Clinical immunogenicity 
The immunogenicity of PreHevbri was evaluated in comparison with a licensed hepatitis B vaccine 
(Engerix-B) in two randomised, active controlled, double-blinded, multi-centre Phase 3 clinical trials 
in adults. PreHevbri and Engerix-B were given as a 3-dose regimen at 0, 1, and 6 months. 
Study Sci-B-Vac-001 in adults age ≥18 years 
The primary immunogenicity endpoint of the study was the seroprotection rate (SPR), defined as the 
percentage of subjects with anti-HBs levels of ≥10 mIU/mL The two co-primary analyses, tested 
hierarchically, were: (1) non-inferiority of PreHevbri compared to Engerix B at Day 196, 4 weeks 
after receiving the third dose in all adults age ≥18 years and (2) superiority of PreHevbri compared to 
Engerix-B in subjects ≥45 years old at Day 196.  
Non-inferiority was met if the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference in 
SPR (PreHevbri minus Engerix B) was greater than -5%. Superiority was met if the lower bound of 
the 95% CI of the difference in SPR (PreHevbri minus Engerix B) was greater than 0%. 
The study met both co-primary endpoints. The SPR in subjects ≥18 years of age in the PreHevbri 
group was non-inferior to the Engerix B group at Study Day 196 (91.4% vs. 76.5%) and the SPR in 
subjects ≥45 years of age was superior to the Engerix B group at Study Day 196 (89.4% vs. 73.1%). 
Higher SPR and anti-HBs titres (GMC, geometric mean concentration) were noted for PreHevbri 
compared with Engerix-B at all time points (Table 2), with peak titres at Day 196 (1424.52 mIU/mL 
vs. 235.43 mIU/mL) and persistent titres at Day 336 (546.79 mIU/mL vs. 83.48 mIU/mL). Results 
were consistent across key subgroups based on age, gender, diabetes status, BMI, daily alcohol 
consumption, and smoking status, with all lower bounds of 95% CIs of the difference in SPR being 
above the preset margin of non-inferiority and superiority (Table 2).

Enrolment of subjects in Sci-B-Vac-001 to receive either PreHevbri or Engerix B was stratified by 
three age groups: age 18-44 years (n=125 vs. n=135 subjects), age 45-64 years (n=325 vs. n=322, and 
age 65+ (n=268 vs. n=266. PreHevbri achieved higher seroprotection rates in each of these groups at 
Day 196, four weeks after the third dose (age 18-44: 99.2% vs. 91.1%; age 45-64: 94.8% vs. 80.1%; 
age 65+: 83.6% vs. 64.7%). 
Study Sci-B-Vac-002 in adults age 18-45 years  
The primary endpoint of the study was to compare 3 lots of PreHevbri and Engerix-B for immune 
response assessed by measuring GMC of anti-HBs. The data from the three lots were combined 
(pooled) to demonstrate that the SPR on Study Day 196, 4 weeks after completion of the 3-dose 
regimen of PreHevbri was non-inferior to Engerix-B. Non-inferiority of PreHevbri compared to 
Engerix B was based on the difference in SPR and the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI, using the 
preset margin of -5%. 
The GMC of anti-HBs titres in the PreHevbri groups were consistent across all three lots and higher 
than Engerix B at all time points, including at peak at Study Day 196 (Lot A: 5979.5 mIU/mL; Lot B: 
4855.3 mIU/mL; Lot C: 5553.2 mIU/mL vs. 1526.3 mIU/mL). The SPR in the pooled PreHevbri 
group was also higher at each time point than Engerix B and demonstrated non-inferiority at Day 196 
(99.3 vs. 94.8) after the required 3-dose course (Table 3).

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What PreHevbri is and what it is used for 
PreHevbri is a vaccine which prevents infection caused by the hepatitis B virus. It is used in adults to 
protect from all known types of hepatitis B virus.  
PreHevbri may also protect against hepatitis D which can only occur in people who have hepatitis B 
infection. 
What is hepatitis B 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Hepatitis B is an infectious illness of the liver caused by a virus. Hepatitis B virus infection can 
cause serious liver problems such as “cirrhosis” (scarring in the liver) or liver cancer. 
Some people infected with the hepatitis B virus become carriers, which means that they may not 
feel ill but continue to have the virus in their body and they can still infect other people. 
The disease spreads by the hepatitis B virus entering the body through contact with an infected 
person’s body fluids, such as in the vagina, blood, semen, or spit (saliva). A mother who is a 
carrier of the virus can also pass the virus to her baby at birth. 
The main signs of the illness include mild signs of flu (such as headache and fever, feeling 
very tired, dark urine, pale stools [faeces], and yellowing of the skin and eyes [jaundice]). 
However, some people with hepatitis B do not look or feel ill. 
How PreHevbri works 
When a person is given the PreHevbri vaccine, it helps the body’s natural defence system 
(immune system) produce specific protection (antibodies) against the hepatitis B virus. 
- 
- 
- 
PreHevbri contains a substance (called an ‘adsorbent’)  which improves the body’s production 
of antibodies and makes the protection last for longer. 
A course of three injections of PreHevbri is required to provide full protection against 
hepatitis B. 
PreHevbri is not used to treat a person who is already infected with the hepatitis B virus 
including anyone who has previously been infected and who is now a carrier of the virus.

Prehevbri is a ‘3-antigenic’ vaccine, which contains small amounts of the three antigens 
(pre-S1, pre-S2, S) from the ‘outer coating’ of the hepatitis B virus. This ‘outer coating’ is not 
infectious and cannot make you ill. 
2.  What you need to know before you receive PreHevbri 
You must NOT receive PreHevbri: 
- 
if you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine   
(listed in section 6). Signs of an allergic reaction may include breathing difficulty, swelling, 
light-headedness, fast heartbeat, sweating, and loss of consciousness. 
if you have ever previously had a sudden, life-threatening allergic reaction to any vaccine 
against hepatitis B.  
You must not receive PreHevbri if either of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your 
doctor, pharmacist or nurse before receiving PreHevbri. 
Warnings and precautions  
- 
Your doctor, pharmacist or nurse will make sure that appropriate medical treatment is readily 
available in case you should develop a sudden and rare anaphylactic reaction (a very severe 
allergic reaction with symptoms such as breathing difficulty, swelling, light-headedness, fast 
heartbeat, sweating, and loss of consciousness) after you have been given the vaccine. This 
reaction may occur when any vaccine is injected, including PreHevbri. Seek urgent medical 
attention if you develop any of these symptoms after you are given the injectionas this could be 
a life-threatening allergic reaction.  
Fainting can occur following, or even before, any needle injection, therefore tell the doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse if you fainted with a previous injection. 
If you are ill with a high fever, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse as they may delay the 
vaccination until you are feeling better. A minor infection such as a cold should not be a 
problem, but your doctor, pharmacist or nurse will decide if you could still be vaccinated. 
If you have low blood platelets or any blood-clotting disorders, then bleeding or bruising may 
occur after you are given the injection. Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you have any of 
these conditions.  
PreHevbri may not prevent hepatitis B infection if you already have an unrecognised hepatitis B 
infection at the time of vaccine administration. 
As with any vaccine, PreHevbri may not protect all people who are vaccinated. 
PreHevbri does not protect you against other liver infections such as hepatitis A, C, and E. 
If you are on dialysis for a kidney problem or if you have a weakened immune system your 
doctor may need to do a blood test to check if the vaccination has worked well enough to 
protect you against hepatitis B.  
If you have any concerns or you are not sure about any of the above, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse before receiving PreHevbri.  
Children and adolescents 
PreHevbri has not been fully tested in children under 18 years of age, it should not be used in this age 
group.  
Other medicines and PreHevbri 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other 
medicines, including any other vaccine.  
In addition to PreHevbri, you may be given an injection of hepatitis B 'immuno-globulins'. This will 
give you immediate short-term protection against hepatitis B infection. If this happens your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse will make sure that the two injections are given in different parts of the body. 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, 
ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before being given this vaccine. 
It is unknown whether PreHevbri is excreted in human milk. A risk to the suckling child cannot be 
excluded. Discuss with your doctor or nurse whether the risks and benefits of breast-feeding your child 
outweigh the benefit of vaccination and whether you should stop breast-feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
PreHevbri is unlikely to have any effect on the ability to drive and use machines. If you feel tired, 
or have a headache or feel dizzy after having the vaccine, do not drive or use any machines until you 
feel well again.  
PreHevbri contain sodium and potassium 
This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. that is to say is essentially 
'sodium-free’. 
This vaccine  contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) per dose, i.e. that is to say is essentially 
‘potassium-free’. 
3. 
How PreHevbri is given 
PreHevbri will be given to you as an injection by a doctor, pharmacist or nurse. The vaccine will 
usually be injected into a muscle in your upper arm. 
You will be given a total of three injections. Each injection will be given on separate visits: 
- 
- 
- 
1st injection: on a date agreed with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse;  
2nd injection: 1 month after the 1st injection; 
3rd injection: 6 months after the 1st injection. 
The recommended dose for each injection is 10 micrograms (1 mL of suspension for injection ). 
If you forget a scheduled dose of PreHevbri 
If you miss a scheduled dose, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse to arrange another visit to 
receive the missed dose. 
Make sure you receive the complete course of three injections or you may not be fully protected.  
If you have any further questions on the use of this vaccine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

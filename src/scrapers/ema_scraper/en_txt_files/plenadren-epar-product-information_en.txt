CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment of adrenal insufficiency in adults.
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Posology
Plenadren is given as maintenance therapy. Oral replacement doses must be individualised according 
to the clinical response. A common maintenance dose is 20–30 mg per day, given once daily in the 
morning. In patients with some remaining endogenous cortisol production a lower dose may be 
sufficient. 40 mg is the highest maintenance dose studied. The lowest possible maintenance dosage 
should be used. In situations when the body is exposed to excessive physical and/or mental stress, 
patients may need additional substitution of immediate release hydrocortisone tablets especially in the 
afternoon/evening, see also section ‘Use in intercurrent illness’ where other ways of temporarily 
increasing the dose of hydrocortisone is described.
Changing from conventional oral glucocorticoid treatment to Plenadren
When changing patients from conventional oral hydrocortisone replacement therapy given three times 
daily to Plenadren, an identical total daily dose may be given. Due to a lower bioavailability of the daily 
dose of Plenadren compared to that of conventional hydrocortisone tablets given three times daily (see 
section 5.2) clinical response needs to be monitored and further dose individualisation may be required. 
Changing patients from hydrocortisone tablets given twice daily, cortisone acetate or synthetic 
glucocorticoids to Plenadren has not been studied, but changing to a hydrocortisone equivalent daily 
dose of Plenadren is recommended in these instances; further dose individualisation may be required.
2
Use in intercurrent illness
During intercurrent illness, there should be high awareness of the risk of developing acute adrenal 
insufficiency.
In severe situations, an increase in dose is immediately required and oral administration of 
hydrocortisone must be replaced with parenteral, preferably intravenous treatment. Intravenous
administration of hydrocortisone is warranted during transient illness episodes such as severe infections, 
in particular gastroenteritis associated with vomiting and/or diarrhoea, high fever of any aetiology or 
extensive physical stress, such as for instance serious accidents and surgery under general anaesthesia, 
see section 4.4.
In less severe situations when intravenous administration of hydrocortisone is not required, for instance 
low grade infections, fever of any aetiology and stressful situations such as minor surgical procedures, 
the normal oral daily replacement dose must be increased temporarily; the total daily dose should be 
increased by administering the maintenance dose twice or thrice daily with 8 ±2 hours intervals (an 
increase in number of administrations, not increasing the morning dose). This regimen has been 
documented in over 300 intercurrent illness episodes within the clinical study programme. At the 
discretion of the treating physician, immediate release hydrocortisone tablets can be given instead of 
Plenadren or may be added to treatment. Increasing the dose of hydrocortisone at one dose occasion 
increases the total plasma exposure of cortisol less than proportional, see section 5.2. Once the 
intercurrent illness episode is over, patients can return to the normal maintenance dose.
Special populations
Elderly
In case of age-related low body weight, monitoring of the clinical response is recommended and dose 
adjustment to a lower dose may be required, see section 5.2.
Renal impairment
There is no need for dosage adjustment in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. In patients 
with severe renal impairment monitoring of the clinical response is recommended and dose adjustment 
may be required, see section 5.2.
Hepatic impairment
There is no need for dose adjustment in mild to moderate hepatic impairment. In case of severe hepatic 
impairment, the functional liver mass decreases and thus the metabolising capacity for hydrocortisone. 
Therefore, monitoring of the clinical response is recommended and dose adjustment may be required, 
see section 5.2.
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of Plenadren in children/adolescents aged below 18 years have not yet been 
established. No data are available.
Method of administration
Patients should be instructed to take Plenadren orally with a glass of water on awakening at least 
30 minutes before food intake, preferably in an upright position and between 6.00 am and 8.00 am in the 
morning. It should be swallowed whole; tablets should not be divided, chewed or crushed. If more than 
one daily administration is required the morning dose should be given as instructed, additional doses 
given later during the day can be given with or without food.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Acute adrenal insufficiency
Acute adrenal insufficiency may develop in patients with known adrenal insufficiency who are on 
inadequate daily doses or in situations with increased cortisol need. Events have been reported in 
patients treated with Plenadren. Adrenal crisis can develop in patients with acute adrenal insufficiency. 
Therefore, patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms of acute adrenal insufficiency and of 
adrenal crisis and the need to seek immediate medical attention.
During adrenal crisis parenteral, preferably intravenous administration of hydrocortisone in high 
doses, together with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion, should be administered 
according to current treatment guidelines.
Concomitant infections
During transient illnesses such as low grade infection, fever of any aetiology, stressful situations such 
as minor surgical procedures, the daily replacement dose must be increased temporarily, see 
section 4.2, ‘Use in intercurrent illness’. The patient must be carefully informed how to act in these 
situations and also advised to immediately seek medical attention should an acute deterioration occur; 
especially in cases of gastroenteritis, vomiting and/or diarrhoea leading to fluid and salt loss, as well as 
to inadequate absorption of oral hydrocortisone.
Patients with adrenal insufficiency and concomitant retroviral infection, such as HIV, need careful 
dose adjustment due to potential interaction with antiretroviral medicinal products and increased 
hydrocortisone dose due to the infection.
Scientific reports do not support immunosuppressive effects of hydrocortisone in doses that have been 
used for replacement therapy in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Therefore, there is no reason to 
believe that replacement doses of hydrocortisone will exacerbate any systemic infection or worsen the 
outcome of such an infection. Moreover, there is no reason to believe that doses of hydrocortisone 
used for replacement therapy in adrenal insufficiency may reduce the response to vaccines and 
increase the risk of generalised infection with live vaccines.
Gastric emptying and motility disorders
Modified-release tablets are not recommended in patients with increased gastrointestinal motility, i.e.,
chronic diarrhoea, due to the risk of impaired cortisol exposure. There are no data in patients with 
confirmed slow gastric emptying or decreased motility disease/disorder. The clinical response should 
be monitored in patients with these conditions.
Using higher than normal doses of hydrocortisone
High (supra-physiological) dosages of hydrocortisone can cause elevation of blood pressure, salt and 
water retention, and increased excretion of potassium. Long-term treatment with higher than 
physiological hydrocortisone doses can lead to clinical features resembling Cushing´s syndrome with 
increased adiposity, abdominal obesity, hypertension and diabetes, and thus result in an increased risk 
of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
Old age and low body mass index are known risk factors for common adverse reactions of 
pharmacological doses of glucocorticoids such as osteoporosis, thinning of skin, diabetes mellitus, 
hypertension and increased susceptibility to infections.
All glucocorticoids increase calcium excretion and reduce the bone-remodelling rate. Patients with 
adrenal insufficiency on long-term glucocorticoid replacement therapy have been found to have 
reduced bone mineral density.
Prolonged use of high doses of glucocorticoids may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts, and 
glaucoma with possible damage to the optic nerves. Such effects have not been reported in patients 
receiving replacement therapy with glucocorticoids in doses used in adrenal insufficiency.
4
Psychiatric adverse reactions may occur with systemic glucocorticoids. This may occur during 
commencement of treatment and during dose adjustments. Risks may be higher when high doses are 
given. Most reactions resolve after dose reduction, although specific treatment may be necessary.
Pheochromocytoma crisis, which can be fatal, has been reported after administration of systemic 
corticosteroids. Corticosteroids should only be administered to patients with suspected or identified 
pheochromocytoma after an appropriate risk/benefit evaluation.
Thyroid function
Patients with adrenal insufficiency should be monitored for thyroid dysfunction as both 
hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism may markedly influence the exposure of administered 
hydrocortisone.
Treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency often warrants addition of a mineralocorticoid.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Hydrocortisone interactions listed below have been reported after therapeutic doses of glucocorticoids.
Potent CYP 3A4 inducers such as phenytoin, rifabutin, carbamazepine, barbiturates, rifampicin, 
St. John’s wort and less potent inducers such as the antiretroviral medicinal products efavirenz and 
nevirapine can enhance the metabolic clearance of cortisol, decrease terminal half-life and thus reduce 
circulating levels and increase fluctuations of cortisol (due to shorter terminal half-life). This may 
require dose adjustment of hydrocortisone.
Potent CYP 3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole 
erythromycin, telithromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir and grapefruit juice can inhibit the metabolism 
of hydrocortisone, and thus increase blood levels. During long-term prophylactic treatment with any of 
the antibiotics, adjustment of the hydrocortisone dosage should be considered.
The effect of corticosteroids may be reduced for 3-4 days after treatment with mifepristone.
The clinical response needs to be monitored in patients given medicinal products affecting gastric 
emptying and motility, see section 4.4.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
Plenadren can be used during pregnancy. There is no indication that hydrocortisone replacement 
therapy in pregnant women with adrenal insufficiency is associated with adverse outcome of the 
mother and/or the foetus. Untreated adrenal insufficiency during pregnancy is associated with poor 
outcome of both the mother and the foetus, therefore it is important to continue treatment during 
pregnancy.
Reproductive studies in animals have shown that glucocorticoids can cause foetal abnormalities and 
reproductive toxicity, see section 5.3.
The dose of hydrocortisone should be carefully monitored during pregnancy in women with adrenal 
insufficiency. Dosing according to individual clinical response is recommended.
Breast-feeding
Hydrocortisone is excreted in breast milk. Plenadren can be used during breast-feeding. Doses of 
hydrocortisone used for replacement therapy are unlikely to have any clinically significant impact on 
the child. Infants of mothers taking high doses of systemic glucocorticoids for prolonged periods may 
be at risk of adrenal suppression.
5
Fertility
Patients with adrenal insufficiency have been shown to have reduced parity, which is most likely due 
to the underlying disease, but there is no indication that hydrocortisone in doses for replacement 
therapy will affect fertility. 
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Plenadren has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Fatigue and episodes of 
short-lasting vertigo have been reported.
Untreated and poorly replaced adrenal insufficiency may affect the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
Hydrocortisone is given as replacement therapy aimed at restoring normal cortisol levels. The adverse 
reaction profile in the treatment of adrenal insufficiency is therefore not comparable to that in other 
conditions requiring much higher doses of oral or parenteral glucocorticoids.
Overall, the frequency and type of adverse reactions were similar for Plenadren once daily modified-
release tablets and hydrocortisone tablets given three times daily in a 12-week study. There was an 
initial increase in the frequency of adverse reactions in about one in five patients, observed up to eight 
weeks after first changing from conventional hydrocortisone tablets given three times daily to once 
daily modified-release tablets. However, these adverse reactions (abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea 
and fatigue) are mild or moderate, transient, of short duration but may require dose adjustment or 
additional concomitant medicinal products, see section 4.2. Fatigue has been reported as very 
common.
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
A total of 80 patients (173 patient-years of data) have been treated with modified-release 
hydrocortisone in clinical studies. Adverse reactions from these studies and from postmarketing 
surveillance are listed below by system organ class and frequency as follows:
Very common ( 1/10); common ( 1/100 to < 1/10).

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
Reports of acute toxicity and/or deaths following hydrocortisone overdose are rare. No antidote is 
available. Symptoms may range from excitement/arousal to mania or psychosis. Signs include high 
blood pressure, elevated plasma glucose levels and hypokalaemia. Treatment is probably not indicated 
for reactions due to chronic poisoning unless the patient has a condition that would render him/her 
unusually susceptible to ill effects from hydrocortisone. In which case, symptomatic treatment should be 
instituted as necessary.
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Corticosteroids for systemic use, glucocorticoids, ATC code: H02AB09
Pharmacodynamic effects
Hydrocortisone is a glucocorticoid and the synthetic form of endogenously produced cortisol. 
Glucocorticoids are important steroids for intermediary metabolism, immune function, 
musculoskeletal and connective tissue and the brain. Cortisol is the principal glucocorticoid secreted 
by the adrenal cortex.
Naturally-occurring glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone and cortisol), which also have salt-retaining 
properties, are used as replacement therapy in adrenal insufficiency. They are also used for their potent 
anti-inflammatory effects in disorders of many organ systems. Glucocorticoids cause profound and 
varied metabolic effects. In addition they modify the body's immune responses to diverse stimuli.
Clinical efficacy
The pivotal study was a randomised, two-period 12-week crossover multi-centre trial in 64 patients 
with primary adrenal insufficiency, 11 of whom had concomitant diabetes mellitus and 11 had 
hypertension. The study compared modified-release tablets given once daily with conventional tablets 
given three times daily using the same daily dose of hydrocortisone (20 to 40 mg).
7
Compared to conventional tablets given three times daily, once daily modified-release tablets resulted 
in an increased cortisol exposure during the first four hours after intake in the morning but reduced 
exposure in the late afternoon/evening and over the 24-hour period (Figure 1).
Figure 1. Observed mean serum cortisol concentration versus clock time following single and multiple 
dosing in primary adrenal insufficiency patients (n=62) after oral administration of Plenadren given 
once daily and hydrocortisone thrice daily.
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption
Following oral administration, hydrocortisone is rapidly and well absorbed from the gastrointestinal 
tract and the absorption has been reported to be more than 95% for an oral 20 mg dose (tablets). 
Hydrocortisone is a class II active substance according to the biopharmaceutical classification system 
(BCS) with a high intestinal permeability and a low dissolution rate, especially at higher doses. The 
modified-release tablet has an outer coating layer that provides an immediate release of the drug and 
an extended release core. The immediate-release part provides a rapid onset of absorption and the 
extended-release part provides a more extended plasma profile of cortisol. The bioavailability 
(AUC0-24h) is 20% lower with the modified-release tablet compared to the same daily dose of 
hydrocortisone given as conventional tablets three times daily. When the oral dose is increased the 
total plasma exposure of cortisol increased less than proportional. The exposure increased three-fold 
when the dose of hydrocortisone modified-release increased from 5 mg to 20 mg.
The absorption rate of hydrocortisone was reduced after food intake resulting in a delay in the time to 
maximal concentration in plasma from on average less than 1 hour to over 2.5 hours. On the other 
hand, the extent of absorption and bioavailability was approximately 30% higher for the 20 mg tablet 
after food intake compared to fasting and there was no absorption failure or dose dumping.
Distribution
In plasma, cortisol is bound to corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG, also called transcortin) and 
albumin. The binding is about 90%.
Elimination
The terminal half-life has been reported to be about 1.5 hours following intravenous and oral dosing of 
hydrocortisone tablets. The terminal half-life of cortisol following administration of Plenadren was 
8
about 3 hours and formulation release controlled. This terminal half-life is similar to the 
pharmacokinetics of endogenous cortisol that also is secretion-controlled.
Hydrocortisone (cortisol) is a lipophilic drug that is eliminated completely via metabolism with a low 
clearance and accordingly low intestinal and hepatic extraction ratios.
Hydrocortisone is eliminated completely by metabolism by 11ßHSD type 1 and type 2 enzymes and 
CYP 3A4 in the liver and in peripheral tissue. CYP 3A4 is involved in the clearance of cortisol by the 
formation of 6β-hydroxycortisol which is excreted in urine. The transport of cortisol across 
membranes is expected to be mediated mainly by passive diffusion and therefore renal and biliary 
clearances are negligible.
Special populations
Renal impairment
A small amount of cortisol is excreted in the urine unchanged (<0.5% of the daily production), 
meaning that cortisol is eliminated completely by metabolism. Since severe renal impairment may 
affect medicinal products completely eliminated via metabolism, dose adjustment may be needed.
Hepatic impairment
No study has been performed in patients with hepatic impairment, however data in the literature for 
hydrocortisone support that no dose adjustment is required in mild to moderate hepatic impairment. In 
case of severe hepatic impairment, the functional liver mass decreases and thus the metabolising 
capacity for hydrocortisone. This may require dose individualisation.
Paediatric population
No pharmacokinetic data are available in children or adolescents.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Animal experiments have shown that prenatal exposure to very high doses of glucocorticoids can 
induce malformations (cleft palate, skeletal malformations). Animal studies have also shown that 
prenatal exposure to high doses of glucocorticoids (but lower than teratogenic doses) may be 
associated with increased risk of intrauterine growth retardation, cardiovascular disease in adulthood 
and permanent changes in glucocorticoid receptor density, neurotransmitter turnover and behaviour.

1. What Plenadren is and what it is used for
Plenadren contains a substance called hydrocortisone (sometimes called cortisol). Hydrocortisone is a 
glucocorticoid. It belongs to a group of medicines called corticosteroids. Glucocorticoids occur 
naturally in the body, and help to maintain your general health and well-being.
Plenadren is used in adults to treat a condition known as adrenal insufficiency, or cortisol deficiency. 
Adrenal insufficiency occurs when your adrenal glands (just above your kidneys) do not produce 
enough of the hormone cortisol. Patients suffering from long-term (chronic) adrenal insufficiency need 
a replacement therapy to survive.
Plenadren replaces the natural cortisol that is missing in adrenal insufficiency. The medicine delivers 
hydrocortisone to your body throughout the day. The cortisol levels in your blood increase rapidly to a 
maximum level, about 1 hour after taking the tablet in the morning, and then gradually decrease over 
the day with no or almost no cortisol level in the blood in the late evening and night when the levels 
should be low.
2. What you need to know before you take Plenadren
Do not take Plenadren
-
if you are allergic to hydrocortisone or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).

when you have a condition that makes you unable to take this medicine or when the medicine is 
not absorbed properly from your stomach. This may happen when you have stomach problems 
involving vomiting and/or diarrhoea. In these situations you should seek immediate medical 
care in order to receive treatment with injections of hydrocortisone and extra fluid 
administration.
23
-
-
-
-
if you have short-term or temporary illness such as infections, fever or situations causing a great 
amount of physical stress, such as surgery: your dose of hydrocortisone must be temporarily 
increased. Ask your doctor promptly for information on how you should handle these situations. 
If you are to have surgery, tell your doctor/dentist before the surgery that you are taking this 
medicine.
if for any other reason your general health is declining although you take your medicine as 
prescribed; seek immediate medical care.
if you have pheochromocytoma (a rare tumour of the adrenal glands). 
if your thyroid gland is not working normally tell your doctor since your dose of Plenadren may 
need to be adjusted.
Children and adolescents
Plenadren is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years old as it has not 
been studied in these patients.
Other medicines and Plenadren
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other 
medicines. During long term treatment with medicines treating infections (antibiotics) the dose of 
Plenadren may need adjustment by your doctor. If used with mifepristone, a treatment used to end a 
pregnancy, the effect of Plenadren may be reduced.
In addition, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using any of the following medicines, as the dose 
of Plenadren may need to be changed:






Phenytoin, carbamazepine and barbiturates - used to treat epilepsy
Rifampicin or rifabutin - used to treat tuberculosis
Ritonavir, efavirenz and nevirapine – used to treat HIV infection
St. John’s wort - used to treat depression and other conditions
Ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole and voriconazole - used to treat fungal infections
Erythromycin, telithromycin and clarithromycin - used to treat bacterial infections
Plenadren with food and drink
Do not take this medicine with grapefruit juice as the juice will conflict with the action of this 
medicine.
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.
It is important that you continue treatment with Plenadren during pregnancy. Treatment in pregnant 
women with adrenal insufficiency is unlikely to cause any harmful effects on the mother and/or the 
baby. You should tell your doctor if you become pregnant as the dose of Plenadren may have to be 
adjusted.
You can breast-feed during Plenadren treatment. Hydrocortisone is excreted in breast milk. Doses of 
hydrocortisone used for replacement therapy are unlikely to have any effect on the child. However, 
talk to your doctor if you plan to breast-feed your baby.
Fertility in women with adrenal insufficiency or cortisol deficiency may be reduced. There is no 
indication that Plenadren, in doses used for replacement therapy, will have an effect on fertility.
Driving and using machines
This medicine may have minor influence on your ability to drive and use machines. Extreme tiredness 
and episodes of short-lasting dizziness (vertigo) have been reported. Poorly treated or untreated 
adrenal insufficiency reduces your ability to concentrate and will affect your ability to drive and use 
machines. It is therefore important to take this medicine as directed by your doctor when driving or 
24
using machines. If you are affected do not drive or use machines, until you have discussed the issue 
with your doctor.
3.
How to take Plenadren
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. The dose is specific for you and is decided by your doctor.



When you wake up in the morning swallow Plenadren tablets whole with a glass of water at 
least 30 minutes before your breakfast, preferable between 6.00 am and 8.00 am in the morning.
You should preferably be in an upright position.
Do not divide, crush or chew the tablets. These tablets deliver hydrocortisone to your body 
throughout the day. If divided, crushed or chewed this may prevent the hydrocortisone dose in 
the tablet to cover the whole day, as it should.
The need for additional doses of Plenadren
During short-term or temporary illnesses such as infection, fever, or physical stress such as surgery you 
will need more hydrocortisone since the body cannot produce the additional amount of cortisol required 
in these situations. The dose must therefore be increased temporarily and your doctor may advise you to 
use other hydrocortisone tablets instead of, or in addition to Plenadren. Please discuss this with your 
doctor and follow the instructions on how to act in these situations.
The daily dose of Plenadren may have to be doubled or tripled in milder conditions such as a mild 
infection or stress. You should then take the second dose of this medicine 6 to 10 hours after the morning 
dose. If it is not enough to double the daily dose, you should take a third dose 6 to 10 hours after the 
second dose (6-10 hour intervals between doses). When your illness is over, return to your normal 
maintenance dose of this medicine.
The following signs and symptoms may suggest that you need to take additional doses of Plenadren or 
other forms of hydrocortisone: fatigue, weight loss, stomach discomfort, feeling light headed when you 
change from sitting to standing or dizziness when standing, darkening of your skin particularly skin 
creases and exposed areas. Contact your doctor promptly for advice if you notice any of these.
However, seek immediate medical help if you notice any of the following: severe weakness, fainting, 
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, back pain, confusion, reduced consciousness, delirium (very 
confused state).
If you take more Plenadren than you should
A too high dose of this medicine for more than a few days may be harmful to your health. Your blood 
pressure may increase, you may gain extra weight and your blood sugar may become too high. An 
increased dose is necessary occasionally in order for the body to cope with increased stress such as 
fever. If extra doses are needed frequently and regularly, you should contact your doctor for 
re-evaluation of your maintenance dose.
If you forget to take Plenadren
If you have forgotten to take your tablet in the morning, take it as soon as possible thereafter. Do not 
take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you experience any signs or symptoms listed in 
the section “The need for additional doses of Plenadren”, contact your doctor immediately.
25
If you stop taking Plenadren
Stopping Plenadren may be life threatening. It is therefore important to continue taking this medicine
as prescribed by your doctor. Do not stop taking it without consulting your doctor.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), also known as C. difficile-associated disease or diarrhoea (CDAD) is 
one of the leading courses of nosocomial infections with disease severity ranging from mild diarrhoea 
to fulminant colitis. The disease is caused by infection of the inner lining of the colon by C. difficile 
bacteria, which produces toxins that cause inflammation of the colon, severe diarrhoea and, in the 
most serious cases, death. CDI accounts for approximately 15-35% of cases of antibiotic-associated 
diarrhoea, and for 95% of cases of antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis. Over the last 10-
20 years the incidence and severity of CDI has increased, particularly in elderly, with a substantial 
number of cases being described also outside healthcare settings. A potential cost of CDI per year in 
the EU of €3 billion has been estimated, assuming an EU population of 457 million. 
Clostridium difficile is a spore-forming, anaerobic, gram-positive rod. CDI is caused by an overgrowth 
of C. difficile in the colon most commonly associated with previous antibiotic use which eradicates or 
disrupts the gut flora, allowing C. difficile to proliferate. Antibiotics commonly linked to CDI include 
cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, clindamycin, ampicillin, and amoxicillin, but almost any antibiotic can 
cause CDI. Proliferating C. difficile produces toxins that cause a variety of complications, including 
pseudomembranous colitis, toxic megacolon, perforations of the colon, and sepsis. C. difficile can also 
persist as spores in the stools leading to frequent recurrences after successful initial treatment. 
Outbreaks of CDI with increased morbidity and mortality have increasingly been reported the last 
decade. These outbreaks are generally associated with the emergence and dissemination of a more 
virulent strain characterized variously as restriction endonuclease analysis (REA) type BI, PFGE 
pulsotype 1 (NAP1), PCR ribotype 027, and toxinotype III. This NAP1/BI/027 strain is known to be 
resistant to fluoroquinolone-class antibiotics and has been shown to produce amounts of toxins A and B 
that are 16-23 times greater than those produced by control strains from toxinotype 0; this 
hypervirulent strain also produces binary toxin. To date, these hypervirulent strains of C. difficile have 
been identified in the US, Canada, and 16 European Union (EU) countries, as well as Switzerland. 
Mild cases of CDI may recover after stopping the causative antibiotic therapy, although this approach 
is often not sufficient for more severe cases and targeted antibiotic therapy has to be instituted.  The 
two most commonly used and approved therapies are oral vancomycin and metronidazole. Both agents 
are in most cases effective in treating CDI but approximately one third of patients who initially respond 
to metronidazole or vancomycin suffer a clinical recurrence, probably due to disruption of the normal 
gut flora by these agents and persistence of the spore form of C. difficile. Orally administered 
metronidazole is almost completely absorbed and the systemic exposure is associated with significant 
adverse effects. Vancomycin is one of very few alternatives of antibiotics used to treat some serious 
and life-threatening infections caused by multi-drug resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). There is evidence of emerging resistance to vancomycin among 
various important pathogens such as MRSA and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). In order to 
slow the continuing emergence of glycopeptide-resistant strains, the medical community discourages 
the use of vancomycin except when necessary. Thus an alternative drug with similar or better activity 
and safety profile as metronidazole or vancomycin against CDI is urgently needed.

2.1.2.  About the product 
Fidaxomicin (also known as OPT-80 and PAR-101) is a novel antibiotic agent and the first 
representative of a new class of antibacterials called macrocycles. It has a narrow spectrum 
antibacterial profile mainly directed against Clostridium difficile and exerts a moderate activity against 
some other gram-positive species. Fidaxomicin is bactericidal and acts via inhibition of RNA synthesis 
by bacterial RNA polymerase at a distinct site from that of rifamycins. The drug product is poorly 
absorbed and exerts its activity in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which is an advantage when used in 
the applied indication, treatment of C. difficile infection (CDI) (also known as C. difficile-associated 
disease or diarrhoea [CDAD]). 
Proposed indication (from the applicant): 
Dificlir (fidaxomicin) is indicated for the treatment of Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) also known as 
C. difficile-associated disease (CDAD) and prevention of recurrences (see Section 5.1). 
Proposed posology and method of administration (from the applicant): 
Dificlir is for oral administration. 
Adults and Elderly (≥ 65 years of age): 
The recommended dose for Dificlir is 200 mg administered twice daily (q12h) for 10 days. 
Paediatric Population: 
The safety and efficacy of Dificlir in children has not yet been established. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Dificlir is presented as film-coated tablets containing 200 mg of fidaxomicin as active substance. The 
other ingredients are microcrystalline cellulose, pregelatinised starch, hydroxypropyl cellulose, 
butylated hydroxytoluene, sodium starch glycollate and magnesium stearate.  
The ingredients of the coating are polyvinyl alcohol, titanium dioxide, talc, macrogol and lecithin. 
The medicinal product is packaged in HDPE bottles with tamper-evident, induction-sealed, 
polypropylene child-resistant caps and desiccants or is packaged in aluminum/aluminum blister strips 
with paper backing. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Fidaxomicin is a white to off-white powder, practically insoluble in water. It is also freely soluble in 
tetrahydrofuran, dimethyl sulfoxide and methanol, soluble in acetone, sparingly soluble in ethanol, 
acetone, ethyl acetate, dichloromethane and acetonitrile, slightly soluble in isopropanol. Figure 1 
describes the absolute stereochemistry of fidaxomicin as determined by x-ray. It was noted that this 
active substance has fourteen chiral centres. Only one polymorph form (polymorph form A) is routinely 
produced by the synthetic process described in the dossier and is used in the manufacture of the 
finished product.

Fidaxomicin 
Manufacture 
Fidaxomicin drug substance is a purified fermentation product produced by the organism 
Dactylosporangium aurantiacum. The manufacturing process consists of inoculum expansion, 
production fermentation, isolation and purification. A full description of the manufacturing process was 
provided. Adequate controls of critical steps and intermediates are sufficient to ensure the quality of 
the active substance, and adequate specifications for starting materials, reagents, and solvents have 
been provided. The purified active substance is packed in low density polyethylene (LDPE) bags. Inner 
and outer LDPE bags with a silica gel sachet are placed inside a triple laminated aluminium bag which 
is placed inside of an HDPE container. The chemical structure of fidaxomicin has been confirmed by 
spectroscopy (IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, Raman and x-ray).  
Specification 
The specification of the active substance complies with ICH Q3A and includes tests for appearance 
(visual), identification, (HPLC & TLC), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), acetic 
acid (HPLC), sulphated ash (Ph.Eur.), heavy metals (Ph.Eur.), particle size distribution, microbiology 
test (Ph.Eur.) specific optical rotation (Ph.Eur.), form identity (XRPD) and water content (Ph.Eur.). A 
detailed description for all analytical methods was provided. Full method validation data was provided 
for the in-house analytical methods and are in accordance with the relevant ICH Guidelines. In general 
analytical methods proposed are suitable to control the quality of the active substance. The impurity 
limits are acceptable and there is no concern from the point of view of safety. Batch analysis data have 
been provided and show consistent compliance with the predefined active substance specification. 
Stability 
Stability data for three batches of fidaxomicin, stored for 48 months at 2 to 8°C were provided. 
Furthermore stability results from long-term (25°C/60%RH) and accelerated studies (40°C/75%RH) 
for three production scale batches were completed according to ICH guidelines demonstrated adequate 
stability of the active substance. The following parameters were monitored during the stability studies: 
assay, impurities (HPLC), appearance (visual) and water content. The microbiology test (Ph.Eur.) is 
Dificlir 
Assessment report  
Page 9/83
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
conducted annually. It was noticed that the test methods applied are those used for release of the 
active substance. It can be concluded that the proposed re-test is justified based on the stability 
results when the active substance is stored in the original packing material.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
All information regarding the choice of the active substance and the excipients are sufficiently justified. 
The main aim of the pharmaceutical development was to formulate a conventional film-coated tablet, 
with a relatively rapid drug release containing 200 mg of fidaxomicin as active substance. 
The initial dosage form to be developed for phase IA of the clinical studies was a hard gelatin capsule. 
Due to long-term stability concerns, a capsule containing 50 mg of fidaxomicin and microcrystalline 
cellulose was thus developed for evaluation in subsequent phases 1B and 2A. Based on the results of 
the phase 2A study, the 200 mg dosage strength of fidaxomicin was selected for further clinical 
development. An immediate release uncoated tablet containing 200 mg of fidaxomicin was developed 
for the first phase 3 clinical trial. During phase 3 the immediate release tablet was further optimized 
for longer shelf life. This optimized formulation was used in the second phase 3 clinical trial.  
Manufacture of the product 
The proposed commercial manufacturing process for the film-coated tablets involves standard 
technology and it is divided into the following steps: mixing, wet granulation, drying, milling, blending, 
compression, film coating, and packaging. The equipment used is commonly available in the 
pharmaceutical industry. The manufacturing process has been adequately described and granulation 
process has been identified as critical and optimised during the drug development. The validation 
protocol proposed for the full scale batches has been provided and the quality of the production 
batches will be evaluated through the results of in process testing as well as the results of finished 
product testing. 
Product Specification 
The product specification is standard for film-coated tablets and contains tests with suitable limits for 
appearance, identification (HPLC & UV), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), uniformity of dosage 
(Ph.Eur), dissolution, residual solvent (GC), disintegration (Ph.Eur.), BHT Assay and microbiological 
purity (Ph.Eur). Impurities and degradation products have been evaluated and found to be acceptable 
from the point of view of safety.  No impurities are caused by the interaction with the excipients used 
in the formulation. All analytical procedures that were used for testing the finished product were 
properly described and satisfactorily validated in accordance with the relevant ICH guidelines. The 
batch analysis data for eight pilot batches confirm that the film-coated tablets can be manufactured 
reproducibly according to the agreed finished product specifications.

Stability of the product 
Stability results from long-term (25°C/60%RH) and accelerated studies (40°C/75%RH) for three 
production scale batches were completed according to ICH guidelines demonstrated adequate stability 
of the active substance. Furthermore, stability data were also provided at refrigerated at 5°C up to 24 
months. The following parameters were monitored during the stability studies: assay, impurities, BHT 
assay, appearance, dissolution and water content. The microbiology test (Ph.Eur.) is conducted 
annually and hardness testing was performed at 24 month. It was noted that the test methods applied 
are those used for release of the finished product. All the results remained well within the specification 
limits during all the stability studies. A photostability testing programme was conducted in accordance 
with the recommendations of ICH guideline Q1B. The results were found to meet the specifications and 
the finished product does not require any special light protection. Forced degradation test were 
performed under thermal, acidic, basic, and oxidative conditions. Based on the results, it was noted 
that these stress conditions (thermal, basic, acid and oxidative) can affect the specifications of the 
finished product.  
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC 
are acceptable. A stability study of the finished product under ICH conditions prepared from different 
intermediates that had been stored in bulk, for the maximum holding time has been recommend to be 
conducted as a post-authorisation measure.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
The pharmaceutical development of the formulation, the manufacturing process, control of the active 
substance and the finished product have been presented in a satisfactory manner and justified in 
accordance with relevant CHMP and ICH guidelines. The manufacturing flow-chart was provided with 
suitable in-process controls. The validation protocol proposed for the full scale batches has been 
provided and the quality of the production batches will be evaluated through the results of in process 
testing as well as the results of finished product testing. The routine specifications and tests methods 
proposed for the active substance and finished product will adequately control the quality of the active 
substance and finished product. Analytical methods were well described and validated in agreement 
with relevant guidelines. 
Batch analyses were presented and the results showed that the finished product meets the 
specifications proposed.  
The container-closure system was found to be suitable to ensure the quality of the finished product as 
shown by the stability data.  
The conditions used in the stability studies comply with the ICH stability guideline. The control tests 
and specifications for finished were adequately established. 
The proposed holding times of the different intermediate products stored in bulk, an ICH stability study 
of the finished product, prepared from the different intermediates that had been stored for the 
maximum holding time, has been recommended. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished products 
have been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate satisfactory 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the 
Dificlir 
Assessment report  
Page 11/83
 
 
 
conclusion that the medicinal product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. 
All other quality issues have been resolved. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following point for investigation: 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Pivotal non-clinical studies on the pharmacology and toxicology of fidaxomicin were conducted in 
accordance with principles of GLP. 
However, it was noted that some studies or part of studies were performed by test facilities where the 
GLP inspection results by the US FDA indicated that objectionable conditions or practices were found: it 
concerns genotoxicity studies and the 28-day oral toxicity and toxicokinetics in Cynomolgus Monkeys. 
In the Cynomolgus study, an amendment to the report was issued about 7 years after the end of the 
last bioanalytical results without any clear explanation. 
Furthermore, an ethical concern should be noted in the 3-month repeated-dose oral toxicity study in 
Beagle dogs: for the highest dose, dogs were dosed up to 48 capsules/day. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Fidaxomicin is active against Gram-positive strains only, in particular Clostridium difficile. The mode of 
action is bactericidal and both parent compound and the major metabolite, OP-1118 have antimicrobial 
activity. Fidaxomicin is an inhibitor of the enzyme RNA polymerase. The site of action is different 
from that of rifamycins. 
In vitro microbiological data is further detailed in the clinical pharmacology report. 
In vivo studies 
  Hamster studies 
In the first of these studies, BIO070503A, hamsters were infected with C. difficile ATCC 43255 
(passaged once through a mouse host), and mortality was compared between animals treated for 7 
days with three dose levels of fidaxomicin (0.3, 0.8, and 2.5 mg/kg/day), vancomycin (5 mg/kg) or 
metronidazole (100 mg/kg). In order to avoid cross-contamination, animals were housed singly in 
microisolator cages. The 50% protective dose was lower than the lowest dose tested, 0.3 mg/kg (the 
animal that died due to non-C. difficile related causes is excluded from the ED50 calculation), and no 
animals died during the treatment phase in any of the other groups excluding control. As expected 
from this model, in which hamsters can redevelop infection following treatment removal, some animals 
(1 per group) died after treatment withdrawal.  
A second study, BIO120203A, investigated the impact of different formulations of fidaxomicin on 
efficacy in the hamster model. In this study, hamsters were infected with a clinical isolate of C. difficile 
(TTU614) and the relative efficacies of fidaxomicin suspended in water, xanthan gum, lecithin, and 
Dificlir 
Assessment report  
Page 12/83
 
 
 
 
Labrasol were compared. The efficacies appeared similar, with 0/6 animals surviving in the untreated 
controls, and 1-2 animals dying in each of the treated groups, more often in the weeks following the 
end of treatment (as is common for this model, in which some animals will redevelop C. difficile 
infection.) This study therefore showed that the formulation is relatively unimportant to the efficacy of 
the compound.  
In summary, preclinical in vivo studies using clindamycin sensitised hamsters showed that fidaxomicin 
was effective in protecting animals from lethal infections with an ED50 of less than 0.3 mg/kg.  Overall, 
the non-clinical pharmacology of fidaxomicin has been acceptably characterised and is consistent with 
expected clinical activity. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Pharmacological effects outside of the primary target have not been identified, and thus no mechanistic 
studies of this nature have been conducted.

In an intravenous cardiac telemetry study in dog, transient hypotension was observed immediately 
after dosing of fidaxomicin in Solutol HS 15. However, the excipient was the probable cause of this 
finding. In another cardiovascular study, also performed in dog, where fidaxomicin was given orally at 
a dose which produced systemic levels in excess of those observed in the intravenous cardiovascular 
study, no effects were seen. Neither fidaxomicin nor its main metabolite OP-1118 had an inhibitory 
effect on the hERG channel current (IC50 greater than the highest doses tested; nominal, 10 µg/mL; 
actual, 7.85 µg/mL for fidaxomicin and 8.37 µg/mL for OP-1118). Studies to assess potential effects of 
fidaxomicin on the respiratory and CNS systems in rats were also negative for an effect. No specific 
safety pharmacology studies on the renal/urinary system or the gastrointestinal system were 
conducted but data from toxicity studies in dog showed that high doses (9600 mg/kg) may produce 
gastrointestinal effects such as emesis and diarrhoea. Overall, the non-clinical pharmacology and 
safety pharmacology of fidaxomicin have been acceptably characterised and has not revealed any 
unexpected effects.

Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Studies to determine the potential synergy/antagonism of fidaxomicin and main metabolite OP-1118 
with other antimicrobials are presented in the clinical pharmacology summary. No other 
pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were performed.

Table 2: 
Overview of pharmacokinetics of fidaxomicin 
Low systemic availability after oral administration. 
Absorption 
Distribution  Mainly the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration. 
Metabolism  Main  metabolite  OP-1118,  a  desisobutyryl  hydrolysis  product  is  an  active 
metabolite.  Acyl  migration  to  form  tiacumicins  C  and  F  has  been  observed.  OP-
1118 has a potential to inhibit CYP3A4 dependent hydroxylation of midazolam and 
testosterone (time and metabolism dependent inhibition). 
Primarily in the faeces.  
Excretion 
Pharmacokinetic and/or toxicokinetic studies with fidaxomicin were performed in rat, rabbit and dog 
and monkey. Validated bioanalytical methods for plasma (rat, rabbit, dog, monkey) and faeces (dog) 
were used. 
In in vitro studies on transit of fidaxomicin and its main metabolite OP-1118 across Caco-2 cell 
monolayers the ratio between basolateral to apical (B-A) transit and apical to basolateral (A-B) transit 
was 73.9 for fidaxomicin at a concentration of 5 µM, and 15.7 for OP-1118 at a concentration of 125 
µM. Both cyclosporine A and ketoconazole (known unspecific inhibitors of P-gp) decreased the (B-
A)/(A-B)-ratio indicating that fidaxomicin and OP-1118 are substrates for P-gp. 
Following oral administration of fidaxomicin in rat, plasma concentrations were low (< LLOQ; 0.5 
µg/mL) and very little fidaxomicin (< 0.01 mg/g) was detected in colon or caecum at any time point 
through 24 hours. In an oral study in dogs the fate of 3H-fidaxomicin after administration at 
6.47 mg/kg, or 245.6 µCi per animal were explored. Radioactivity was not detectable in any plasma 
sample. LC-MS/MS analysis detected low levels (~20 ng/mL) of the metabolite OP-1118 in only two 
samples, at 1 and 2 hours post-dose.  
A greater than proportional increase in plasma levels with dose was recorded in rat and dog given 
intravenous doses and the metabolite OP-1118 exhibited similar greater than proportional increase 
with dose, except in dog where saturation was seen at high doses.  
A 3-month repeated dose study in beagle dogs, using the clinical tablet formulation and oral dose 
levels of 0, 1, 3.2, and 9.6 g/day showed that the extent of exposure for both fidaxomicin and OP-
1118 increased with increasing dose, in a nonlinear fashion: AUC0-tlast increased greater than 
proportionally across the dosing range, while Cmax increased greater than proportionally between the 
1 g and 3.2 g doses and usually proportionally between the 3.2 g and 9.6 g doses. A large interanimal 
variability was found, possibly due to differences in local gut pH. Male and female cynomolgous 
monkeys (3/sex/group) were dosed for 28 days with 0, 10, 30, and 90 mg/kg/day of fidaxomicin. 
Plasma levels (C max and AUC) increased approximately proportionately between the doses. It is 
worthwhile to compare these results with those observed in dogs receiving 90 mg/kg fidaxomicin in 
Labrasol where plasma levels were approximately 5-6×higher than those observed in monkeys 
(C max,~0.15 µg/mL), supporting the use of dogs in assessments of toxicity following oral 
administration. 
The volume of distribution was generally less than total body water, indicating that the small amount 
of drug absorbed is not preferentially partitioned out of total body water and that the ng/mL plasma 
Dificlir

concentrations observed are an appropriate measure of systemic exposure. Studies on protein binding 
in plasma from rats, rabbits, dogs, and humans showed no large differences between species. For 
fidaxomicin, the plasma protein binding in rats, rabbits, dogs, and humans was 96.8%, 98.5%, 97.5%, 
and 97.8%, and for OP-1118, 93.5%, 97.7%, 92.0%, and 96.1%, respectively, over the concentration 
ranges tested (0.1-100 µg/mL).   
Fidaxomicin was hydrolysed to the active major metabolite OP-1118 (desisobutyryl fidaxomicin) in rat, 
dog, monkey and human (not studied in vivo in monkey). OP-1118 was the major species produced in 
rabbit (molar AUC ratio 6.55-10.75), but was detected at modest levels in rat (data from pregnant 
animals) and dog (molar AUC ratios of 0.28-0.41 in rat and 0.09-0.33 in dog). The transformation was 
not CYP or NADPH dependent, and is likely to be catalyzed via an esterase. Other minor pathways 
identified in vitro include monohydroxylation, sulphation, and glucuronidation. Among these 
metabolites, only acyl migration and hydrolysis products were detected in plasma, urine, and faeces 
from dogs. The half-life for both parent compound and major metabolite was less than one hour in rat 
and rabbit and somewhat longer in dog. 
A study with radiolabelled compound in dogs, also described in the section on oral absorption, was 
conducted in which dogs were orally administered (gavage) 6.47 mg/kg of [3H]-fidaxomicin, to deliver 
245.6 µCi/dog. Total recovery of radioactivity was 87%; of this, over 99% was recovered in the faeces, 
while < 1% was recovered in the urine. In bile duct cannulated Beagle dogs administered fidaxomicin 
(400 mg/kg as tablets) less than 1% of the administered drug was recovered in the bile as either 
fidaxomicin or OP-1118. The overall recovery in faeces and bile for fidaxomicin and OP-1118 was 
92.1% ± 9.32% in male and 92.3% ± 11.7% in female dogs. Based upon the observation that a 
second concentration peak was observed in the plasma of some dogs following oral administration, 
hepatic recirculation is possible, although the extent is likely to be low. 
Fidaxomicin show mild inhibition of certain CYP enzymes at levels (10 µg/mL) near the solubility limit 
at physiological pH. OP-1118 is, however, an inhibitor of CYP3A4, at concentrations achievable in the 
gastrointestinal tract. Thus, the potential for inhibition of gut CYP3A4 cannot be ruled out. Both 
fidaxomicin and OP-1118 are substrates for efflux pumps, and this efflux is inhibited by cyclosporine A 
and ketoconazole, inhibitors of P-glycoprotein. Fidaxomicin is also an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein, with 
an IC50 of 2.59 µM (2.74 µg/mL), while OP-1118 is a much weaker inhibitor (IC50 > 125 µM, or 
123 µg/mL). The inhibitory effect of fidaxomicin and OP-1118 on other intestinal transporters has not 
been investigated and the applicant is now planning to investigate the effect of fidaxomicin on MRPs, 
OATPs and BCRP in vitro and in addition attempt to analyse possible signs of DDI involving 
transporters in the clinical studies already performed by analysis of co-medications and possible signs 
of reduced or increased absorption. However, it seems unlikely that screening for reduced effect or 
increased adverse events of co-administered medications that are substrates for MRPs, OATPs and 
BCRP will generate data that can lead to any firm conclusion regarding potential for fidaxomicin to 
interact with these transporters. It is therefore considered sufficient with an in vitro study investigating 
the effect of fidaxomicin on MRPs, OATPs and BCRP. If this study shows a risk for significant interaction 
further in vivo evaluation may be needed. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Fidaxomicin has a low bioavailability, partly due to a low solubility and several different vehicles have 
therefore been explored in order to increase the systemic exposure. Difficulties in obtaining high 
enough plasma levels in rat and rabbit led to the use of intravenous administration in these species. 
Low plasma levels after oral administration was also seen in monkeys. Only one species, the dog for 
which oral administration was possible, was therefore used in a 3 month repeat dose study.  In the 
pivotal studies either intravenous administration using Solutol (PEG stabiliser) as vehicle (reproductive 
Dificlir 
Assessment report  
Page 15/83
 
 
 
and developmental toxicity studies in rat and rabbit, and in vivo genotoxicity in rat) or oral 
administration of tablets in capsules (3 month study in dog) were used. All pivotal studies were 
performed according to GLP. 
Except for histamine like reactions, possibly due to a toxic interaction between fidaxomicin and some 
of the vehicles investigated, no adverse effects were generally seen in any of the studies performed, 
except for soft and coloured faeces, diarrhoea and emesis at high doses. Exposure margins were 
generally high for fidaxomicin and its major metabolite. In several studies the margins were greater 
than 20-100x (AUC) compared to levels found in healthy volunteers, although some species variations 
occurred, e.g. with a margin of 4-6x (AUC) for OP-1118 in the dog. However, it is pointed out that 
taking the 3 and 6 times higher exposure levels for fidaxomicin and OP-1118 in CDI patients into 
account the exposure margins are significantly reduced and results in approximately only similar levels 
of OP-1118 being reached in the 3 month dog study as what might be seen in the clinic. In addition the 
lack of complete PK-data from CDI patients together with the possibility of future exposure of CDI 
patients with more severely affected GI-tract (and thus possibly higher absorption of fidaxomicin) as 
compared to patients studied, create an uncertainty in the establishment of “true” exposure margins. 
This uncertainty is addressed in the RMP by a suggested thorough monitoring of this group of patients.

No treatment-related effects were seen at any dose level up to 1000 mg/kg in rats when administered 
as a single oral dose or at doses up to 200 mg/kg intravenously. Fidaxomicin at 200 mg/kg via 
intravenous injection to rats resulted in 50% mortality but this was considered likely to be due to the 
poor solubility and precipitation of fidaxomicin in vasculature at high plasma concentrations. The 
NOAEL for a single i.v. fidaxomicin dose in the rat was 62.5 mg/kg. At this NOAEL dose, a peak plasma 
level of 3000-10200 ng/mL fidaxomicin was noted at 30 minutes after dose, at least ~100-fold higher 
than the Cmax that might be seen in CDI patients.

monkeys no treatment-related effects were observed at any dose level. The highest dose level (90 
mg/kg/day, Cmax 131-417 ng/mL, AUC0-tlast 288-1180 ng-hr/mL) was considered to be the NOEL.  
The pivotal toxicity study was a 3 month repeated-dose study in dogs dosed orally with fidaxomicin at 
doses of up to 9600 mg/day. There were no test-article related effects on body weights, food 
consumption, clinical or anatomic pathology parameters, ECG or any ophthalmic lesions. Effects of 
fidaxomicin administration were limited to GI effects, as evidenced by clinical observations of 
pale/yellow faeces and white emesis which was considered to be a localized effect caused by the high 
number of tablets administered per day to the dogs (total administered drug product was equivalent to 
approximately 5-7% of the daily food intake) rather than an indicator of test article-related toxicity. 
(Tablets were administrated in capsules. Control group received the same number of empty capsules 
as the high dose group.)  The NOEL was defined as 5 tablets/day (1000 mg/animal/day) and the 
NOAEL as 48 tablets/day (9600 mg/animal/day, corresponding to 942 mg/kg/day in males and 1190 
mg/kg/day in females, based on average body weights), the highest dose administered. At the NOAEL 
dose, the lowest average Cmax values measured at either time point (day 0 or day 86) for either sex 
were 3010 ng/mL for fidaxomicin and 361 ng/mL for the metabolite OP-1118, which are ~100-fold and 
~4-fold higher than peak concentrations seen in CDI patients. The lowest average AUC0-tlast values 
measured at either time point for either sex were 8160 ng-hr/mL for fidaxomicin and 945 ng-hr/mL for 
OP-1118, which are ~20-fold and ~0.6-fold, respectively, compared to what might be seen in patients 
at the therapeutic dose.

Neither fidaxomicin nor OP 1118 were mutagenic in the bacterial reverse mutation assay, while an 
increased frequency of cells with chromosomal aberrations was observed in Chinese Hamster Ovary 
(CHO) cells after treatment with fidaxomicin in absence of metabolic activation at concentrations ≥ 100 
µg/mL. Fidaxomicin was administered to rats intravenously with the top dose selected as the maximum 
tolerated dose (75 mg/kg). A statistically significant increase in micronucleated PCEs was observed in 
the 37.5 mg/kg group 24 hours post dose relative to the control group (p ≤ 0.05). However, since 
there was no dose response and the number of MPCEs in all animals in the positive medium dose were 
within the historical range of 0-2.0 MPCE/2000 PCE from 1997-2002 the result of this test is 
considered to be negative. Since fidaxomicin was found to induce structural aberrations in vitro. a 
second in vivo test was also performed in response to a major objection raised by the CHMP. In order 
to reflect the high concentrations of fidaxomicin in the GI tract as opposed to low systemic exposure 
and to evaluate the possible local clastogenic effect of this drug an in vivo comet analysis of liver and 
duodenal cells has been performed. Rats were treated with up to 2000 mg/kg/day (~150-fold over the 
human daily dose when scaled by small intestinal surface area) for two days and the comet analysis 
showed no difference in liver cells while a dose dependent trend in decreased Tail DNA was shown in 
duodenal cells. However, there was no significant difference in Tail DNA between treated and control 
(vehicle treated) rats at any of the doses used and no significant effect on Tail Migration or Tail 
Moment. In addition only two animals had a Tail DNA % outside the historical vehicle control range 
(2.00-9.25%), 1 out of 6 rats in each of the 1000 and 2000 mg/kg/day dose groups, 1.60% and 
1.19%, respectively. 
Possible mechanisms behind the decrease in %Tail DNA discussed by the applicant are cross-linking, 
tissue processing, cytotoxicity, antioxidant properties, and biological and assay variability. The 
standard protocol used in the present Comet study has been shown to be sufficient for detecting cross-
linkers in primary cells from the GI-tract and kidney, suggesting that the protocol used may be 
regarded as appropriate (although not optimal) for detecting a cross-linker in intestinal cells. The 
absence of toxicity in actively proliferating tissues in the performed in vivo studies (e.g. no evidence of 
histopathological changes seen in the gastrointestinal tract in the 3 month study in dog), which would 
have been expected if fidaxomicin were acting via a cross-linking mechanism, together with the fact 
that no statistically significant effects were seen between control or treated animals or in any other 
parameter in the Comet assay clearly support the conclusion that a cross-linking mechanism for 
fidaxomicin is highly unlikely. This conclusion is further supported by the negative findings in the 
bacterial reverse mutation assays performed.  
An effect due to tissue processing would be expected to occur in all samples regardless of dose group 
and is therefore not seen as a likely explanation. On the other hand cytotoxicity and an effect via 
possible antioxidant properties cannot be ruled out at present and are thus considered to be possible 
mechanisms for the decrease in %Tail DNA seen. Biological and assay variability might also be a 
possible explanation. The variability in the present study, which was similar to that reported by others, 
make interpretation of data difficult especially since the decreased trend in %Tail DNA appears to be 
driven by data from a single animal. The impact of a single value on the statistical significance of the 
decrease in %Tail DNA seen in the present study strongly indicates that variability is a likely 
explanation for the response seen. The biological relevance of the decreased trend in %Tail DNA is 
thus highly questionable. 
Carcinogenicity 
Considering the short (10 days) planned duration of dosing, carcinogenicity studies were not conducted 
with fidaxomicin.

Reproduction Toxicity 
Fidaxomicin did not induce any maternal toxicity and had no toxic effects on fertility or early embryonic 
development at the highest dose tested in rats (6.3 mg/kg/day actual dose given). The lowest AUC0- 
last value measured for fidaxomicin for either sex, at any time point, was 2620 ng-hr/mL, 6-fold higher 
than the AUC that might be expected in CDI patients. 
Maternal, reproductive or embryo-foetal developmental toxicity of fidaxomicin was neither detected at 
the highest dose tested in rats (15 mg/kg/day) nor rabbits (7.5 mg/kg/day).  The lowest mean AUC0-
tlast values measured for fidaxomicin at these dose levels (measurements made on the first and last 
days of dosing) were 9350 ng-hr/mL in the rat and 2280 ng-hr/mL in the rabbit, which are 22-fold and 
6-fold higher, respectively, than the AUC that might be expected in CDI patients. At the same doses, 
the lowest measured OP-1118 AUC0-tlast values were 6320 and 21,600 ng-hr/mL in the rat and 
rabbit, which are 4-fold and 13-fold higher respectively. It should be noted that exposure levels equal 
to or higher than those seen in healthy volunteers where generally only achieved during 2-8 hours in 
rats and rabbits. Since a 24 hour exposure is expected in humans and an even higher exposure is 
expected in CDI patients, there is an uncertainty in the interpretation of the negative findings reported 
and the significance for the human situation. However, since the systemic levels of fidaxomicin and 
OP-1118 are in the ng/mL levels (~100 nM and below) and both compounds are substrates for Pgp and 
thus likely to be largely excluded from the foetus due to the high expression of P-gp in the placenta the 
exposure of the foetus at therapeutic doses is expected to be low. The remaining uncertainty is 
reflected in the suggested text for section 4.6 of the SmPC. 
Local Tolerance  
No local tolerance studies were performed. 
The primary site of exposure in humans is the gut. At the highest doses in the 3 month dog study 
emesis and soft stools were observed but these effects were not exacerbated with continued dosing 
and were neither associated with changes in food consumption or weight gain or any histological 
changes. This suggests that high faecal levels of fidaxomicin up to mg/g levels are not associated with 
gastrointestinal toxicity. 
Other toxicity studies 
Phototoxicity 
Possible phototoxicity of fidaxomicin  is not necessary to be explored based on the UV spectra 
presented for this compound, with no or very low absorbance in the 290-700 nM range, together with 
a low bioavailability and low expected systemic exposure 
Evaluation of Impurities and Degradation Products 
Several impurities of fidaxomicin remain in the drug product after the fermentation based development 
process and eleven impurities are included in the proposed specification together with four additional 
degradation products. Exposure margins for the defined impurities have been calculated by comparing 
expected exposures based on analysis of the fidaxomicin lots used in the key qualifying studies (in vivo 
genotoxicity test and 3 month repeated dose in dog) with theoretical maximum exposure levels in 
humans based on a 400 mg daily dose. Data on degradation products has been presented and in order 
to evaluate the impurities at levels higher than those found in clinical batches, genotoxicity studies 
have been conducted using an aged batch of fidaxomicin (approximately 3.5 years). The use of the 3 
month dog study and the two in vivo genotoxicity studies performed (see above) for qualification of 
impurities is considered to be acceptable. In addition the use of the second in vivo assay together with 
Dificlir 
Assessment report  
Page 22/83
 
 
 
an in vitro gene mutation bacterial assay which was performed using an aged batch of fidaxomicin for 
qualification of degradation products is also considered to be acceptable. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The log Kow for fidaxomicin is shown to be below the threshold of 4.5 and there is thus likely no need 
to investigate the persistence, bioaccumulation or toxicity of fidaxomicin (additional log Kow 
determination is part of the planned Tier A evaluation). The calculated PECsurface water is concluded 
to be over the trigger limit and a Tier A evaluation of fidaxomicin will be performed. The applicant has 
provided timelines for the studies necessary to evaluate the environmental fate and effect of 
fidaxomicin including timelines for the Phase II Tier A environmental fate and effect analysis and 
submission of the report. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Fidaxomicin showed low acute toxicity and the only mortalities reported were after intravenous 
administration of 200 mg/kg to rats, which might have been due to a precipitation of fidaxomicin in the 
vasculature (solubility is 18 µg/mL at pH 7 and 104 µg/mL at pH 8). No serious adverse effects were 
either seen after repeat doses of fidaxomicin even though high exposure levels of fidaxomicin and its 
major metabolite OP-1118 were achieved, in rat and rabbit (after intravenous administration of 
fidaxomicin) and in dog (after oral administration of large amounts of tablets). In the pivotal toxicity 
study, a 3 month repeated-dose study in dogs dosed orally with fidaxomicin at doses of up to 9600 
mg/day, there were no test-article related effects. Effects of fidaxomicin were limited to the 
gastrointestinal tract, as evidenced by clinical observations of pale/yellow faeces and white emesis. 
The NOAEL was 9600 mg/animal/day. 
The genotoxic potential of fidaxomicin and the major metabolite OP-1118 is concluded to be non-
significant, based on the overall results from in vitro and in vivo studies (erythrocyte micronucleus test 
and comet analysis of liver and duodenal cells in rat).   
Fidaxomicin had no reproductive, maternal or embryo-foetal developmental toxic effects. The 
conclusion made by the applicant that the exposure margins are sufficient is generally accepted. The 
low systemic exposure combined with the shown affinity of both fidaxomicin and OP-1118 for Pgp, 
which is highly expressed in placenta, is likely to reduce exposure and thus the risk for the foetus at 
therapeutic doses. The remaining uncertainty is reflected in the suggested text for section 4.6 of the 
SmPC. 
Eleven impurities of fidaxomicin are included in the proposed specification of drug substance together 
with four additional degradation products. Exposure margins for the defined impurities have been 
calculated by comparing estimates of exposures based on analysis of the fidaxomicin lots used in the 
key qualifying studies and theoretical maximum exposures in humans. Even though there are 
uncertainties regarding the expected exposure levels in patients (discussed below) the use of the 3 
month dog study together with the two in vivo genotoxicity studies performed for qualification of the 
impurities is considered acceptable. The suggested limit of NMT 0.5% for the degradation products is 
also considered to be justified. 
There are uncertainties regarding exposure levels in CDI patients and especially patients with more 
severely affected GI-tract as compared to patients included in the Phase III studies performed. This 
has also been taken into consideration when exposure margins have been calculated. In addition the 
remaining uncertainty has been addressed in the RMP as well as in recommendations made in the 
SmPC. 
The value of the calculated PECsurface water is over the trigger limit.

As a result of the above considerations, the available data do not allow to conclude definitively on the 
potential risk of fidaxomicin to the environment.  In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take 
due account of technical and scientific progress, the CHMP recommends the following points for further 
investigation to be addressed: 
TierA evaluation of fidaxomicin to be initiated (including an additional determination of log Kow). 
(Timelines have been defined and a final ERA report is expected to be submitted in Q3 2012). 
2.3.7.  Assessment of paediatric data on non-clinical aspects 
No prenatal or postnatal development studies were performed. This is considered acceptable based on 
the reported limited systemic exposure of fidaxomicin and OP-1118 in man and the lack of adverse 
effects on fertility/early embryonic development and embryo-foetal development. Studies in juvenile 
animals were neither performed but will be conducted prior to clinical investigations in paediatric 
populations. 
2.3.8.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical aspects of fidaxomicin have been properly addressed. 
With respect to the ERA, a TierA evaluation of fidaxomicin will be initiated.

Tabular overview of clinical studies 
The clinical development programme for Dificlir (fidaxomicin, also referred to as OPT-80), 200 mg film-
coated tablets consists of three phase 1 studies, one phase 2A study and two phase 3 studies:

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The product is intended for local action but regardless of its physiochemical properties (poor solubility, 
poor permeability and high molecular weight) the parent drug and its main metabolite OP1118 reach 
plasma concentrations in the 30 and 100 ng/ml range after oral administration. The PK of fidaxomicin 
and OP-1118 was characterized in (above tabled) 6 clinical studies. OP-1118 has a narrow spectrum of 
activity comparable to that of fidaxomicin, although with lower activity. Across studies, approximately 
2-fold higher plasma levels of OP-1118 than for those of the parent compound are seen.  
Dificlir 
Assessment report

Several in vitro studies with human biomaterials were also performed to characterize the efflux 
transport and metabolism of fidaxomicin, with the aim of ascertaining the potential for concomitantly 
administered drugs to alter the disposition of fidaxomicin. Conversely, in vitro studies were also 
performed to assess if fidaxomicin (and its main metabolite OP-1118) have the ability to inhibit the 
efflux transport or metabolism of other drugs.  
Several adequately validated bioanalytical methods have been used during the development 
programme. 
Absorption  
There is no estimate of absolute bioavailability in humans but it was determined in several nonclinical 
dog studies, using different formulations with various solubility enhancers, with estimates around 0.2-
3%.  
In a caco-2-assay, the efflux ratio values were markedly in excess of 2 for both fidaxomicin and OP-
1118 (the efflux ratios of fidaxomicin were 44.9 and 24.7 at 5 and 10 μM. For OP-1118, the efflux ratio 
of was 6.36 at 125 μM.), indicating that active transport via efflux proteins was involved. A marked 
decrease on the efflux ratio was seen in the presence of cyclosporin A and ketoconazole indicating that 
fidaxomicin and OP-1118 are P-gp substrates.

There have been numerous changes in the formulations and manufacturers over the development 
programme.  
The initial dosage form evaluated in a Phase 1A clinical trial (OPT-80 1A-SD) was a hard gelatin 
capsule filled with a solution of 50 mg of fidaxomicin in Labrasol. Due to long-term stability concerns, a 
capsule containing 50 mg of fidaxomicin and microcrystalline cellulose, NF (Avicel PH-102) was 
developed for evaluation in subsequent Phase 1B (OPT-80 1B-MD) and 2A (OPT-80 Phase 2A) trials. 
Based upon the results of the Phase 2A trial, the 200 mg dosage strength of fidaxomicin was selected 
for further clinical development; an immediate release uncoated tablet containing 200 mg of 
fidaxomicin was developed for Phase 3 clinical trial (101.1.C.003).  
In the Phase 3 study 101.1.C.003, a modification of the solvent used for crystallization of the drug 
substance was made, and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) was added to the finished drug product with 
the goal of improving stability and extending product shelf-life. In order to evaluate whether this 
change affected the pharmacokinetics of the active drug, the plasma levels were compared between 
the two formulations (Table below). In study 101.1.C.003 the formulation of fidaxomicin was changed 
after approximately the first 100 subjects.

The to-be-marketed formulation (formulation 1, - 200 mg film coated tablet) was used in the phase III 
studies [exclusively for the C.004 and for a high majority of patients in the C.003 (90/287 patients 
were not receiving the formulation 1 in this latter study)]. No bioequivalence studies have been 
performed to bridge between different formulations. The submitted dissolution studies do not 
constitute a sufficiently discriminative bridge between formulations. This has to be kept in mind when 
looking at PK data from early studies with different formulations. However, within-study comparisons 
of factors which do not involve absorption may however be performed. Fidaxomicin tablets and 
Vancocin® capsules were over-encapsulated for blinding purposes during the Phase 3 clinical trials. The 
possible impact of over-encapsulation on efficacy was questioned. As both products met the preset 
criteria of >85% of API released within 30 min and as the drugs are locally acting in the lower GI tract, 
over-encapsulation is not expected to have any effect on the efficacy of the fidaxomicin tablet or 
Vancocin® capsule. 
The formulation with BHT was also used in the food effect study (OPT-80-005). 
Study OPT-80-005 was a single centre, open-label, randomised, two-period, crossover study to 
determine the pharmacokinetics and the effect of food on the bioavailability of fidaxomicin in healthy 
subjects. 
This study also included a lead-in group of six subjects who received a single 200 mg dose of 
fidaxomicin. The purpose of the lead-in group was to ensure sufficient sensitivity for the bioanalytical 
assessment with the tablet formulation to ensure that the food effect portion of the study would 
provide meaningful data for comparison between the fasted and fed arms of the study. Based on the 
results of the lead-in group, the doses for the main study were increased to a supra-therapeutic dose 
of 400 mg. 
The food-effect portion of the study was a randomised, single-dose, two-period (7-day washout), two-
way crossover study of healthy volunteers (N = 28), with safety and PK analysis of plasma after a 
single oral 400 mg dose of study medication during fasting, or within 30 minutes of a high-fat 
breakfast. 
Pharmacokinetic blood samples were collected on Day 1 and Day 8. Faecal collection for PK analysis 
occurred at baseline (first sample on Day -1) and continued for 5 days post-dose in Period 1 only. 
Urine was collected at baseline (first voided sample on Day 1 prior to dosing) up to 24 hours post-dose 
of Period 1 only.

Fidaxomicin and OP-1118 Cmax values were 22% and 33% lower in the fed state compared to the 
fasted state. The AUC0-t for both moieties was equivalent in the fed state compared to the fasted 
state.  Urine data and faecal data did not contribute to the assessment of the food interaction due to 
urine levels of fidaxomicin being undetectable in all samples collected in this study and very variable 
faecal data, respectively. 
No specific food-recommendations were given in the subsequent clinical phase III studies. Due to the 
disease, large meals are not expected and also due to the occurrence of diarrhoea, the potential 
importance of food is likely small. In conclusion, the recommendation to take the product regardless of 
meals is in accordance with the phase III trial recommendations and is considered supported.

Distribution 
Fidaxomicin has not been administered to humans intravenously as its low aqueous solubility makes it 
extremely difficult to solubilise in a formulation acceptable for human use. However, in intravenous 
studies in non-clinical species (e.g., rat, rabbit and dog) where high volumes (10 mL/kg) of dilute 
solution was used, the volume of distribution at steady state was found to be less than or equal to 
body water, suggesting that fidaxomicin does not extensively distribute away from body water. 
Elimination 
The main components of the elimination of systemically available fidaxomicin have not been identified. 
There are however indications of hepatic elimination of some kind, such as biliary excretion (increased 
systemic exposure in patients with signs of hepatic impairment as well as secondary peaks observed in 
the plasma – concentration time curve).  
Most of a 200-300 mg oral dose (93%±42%) is excreted as drug related compounds in faeces (study 
OPT-80-1A-SD).  Approximately 26% of a single oral dose is recovered as unchanged drug in faeces 
and over 66% of the dose is found as OP-1118. Peak concentrations in the faeces are generally 
observed at least 24 hours after single oral doses and concentrations remain detectable in the faeces 
for up to 5 days. Less than 1 % of the dose is excreted in the urine. Fidaxomicin’s half life is 
approximately 8-10 h. 
The metabolism of fidaxomicin has been studied in multiple in vitro systems including phosphate buffer 
solution, human intestinal and liver microsomes, human hepatocytes, and human plasma. A hydrolysis 
reaction (plausibly mediated by esterases) appears to be the main route of metabolism of fidaxomicin 
in vitro. Based on the presented data, it is not possible to say whether OP-1118 has been formed in 
the GI tract or following absorption of fidaxomicin.  
No mass balance study has been conducted. Hence, there was concern regarding an insufficient 
characterisation of the elimination pathways, formation of metabolites and plasma exposure of 
metabolites other than OP-1118.  The applicant has provided some additional information regarding 
known and expected metabolites in dog and human plasma, faeces and urine samples and dog bile. 
Monohydroxylated metabolites were not detectable in any of the in vivo samples examined.  
Glucuronidated and/or sulphated metabolites were not detectable in any matrix except for dog bile. 
Additional analyses of human and dog plasma showed that concentrations of the acyl migration 
product Tiacumicin F were higher in dog than in human plasma. Based on these data it cannot be 
completely excluded that there may be any unknown metabolites formed with exposure greater than 
10% of total drug-related exposure. However, in vitro data do not suggest any difference in metabolic 
profile between human and dog. Furthermore, the absorption is low and Dificlir is to be used only for 
10 days. The lack of characterisation of the human metabolism can therefore be accepted. 
Variability 
Inter-individual variability in systemic exposure to fidaxomicin was generally > 25 % in healthy 
volunteers. There is no valid estimate from patients given the sparse PK sampling applied. No estimate 
of intra-individual variability has been provided. 
Pharmacokinetics of main metabolite 
The PK-characteristics of OP-1118 is fairly well described. The elimination of OP-1118 seems formation 
rate limited as the terminal half life is similar to fidaxomicin’s. The approximately 2-fold higher plasma 
levels of OP-1118 than for those of the parent compound indicate that OP-1118 have a smaller volume 
of distribution than fidaxomicin or/and that OP-1118 to some extent is formed pre-systemically. 
Dificlir 
Assessment report  
Page 29/83
 
 
 
Target population 
There is some degree of uncertainties on to what extent the systemic exposure might increase in case 
of severe degree of inflammatory bowel in CDI patients. Based on very variable data and a between 
study comparison, the maximum plasma concentrations of fidaxomicin and OP-1118 in patients was in 
average 2 times higher than the Cmax values measured in healthy volunteers. The difference is likely 
larger given that only one PK sample was used in the patient study, which makes the estimation of 
Cmax more uncertain. 
The range of plasma concentrations observed in CDI patients could rise up to 237 ng/mL for 
fidaxomicin and 871 ng/mL for the metabolite OP-1118 whereas in healthy individuals in OPT-80-005 
the highest plasma concentrations observed are approximately 10 times lower, at 28.9 ng/mL for 
fidaxomicin and 77.4 ng/mL for OP-1118 (fasted – group 2). This increased absorption is likely due to 
the inflammatory state of the bowels resulting from the infection.  
The levels of fidaxomicin in faecal samples are approximately 2-fold higher than those of the 
metabolite.  
Based on available data faecal concentration does not appear to be predictive of outcome. As a matter 
of fact, regardless the outcome (success, failure) the concentrations are far in excess of MIC (up to> 
30 000 x). Consequently faecal fidaxomicin level/MIC ratio does not appear to be predictive of cure. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Regarding dose proportionality, increasing the dose from 200 to 400 mg did not result in a proportional 
increase in fidaxomicin or OP-1118 Cmax or AUC0-t values.  
The applicant has not discussed the reason for this finding, however, solubility problems is likely one 
part of the explanation. As fidaxomicin is given as a fixed dose, 200 mg, there is no need to follow up 
on this issue. There is no pronounced accumulation of fidaxomicin or OP-1118 following multiple doses. 
Special populations 
Pharmacokinetics in special populations has been investigated using data generated by sparse 
sampling (one sample around predicted Cmax) from the phase III studies.  
Impaired hepatic function 
Hepatic status, based on the Canadian NCI toxicity criteria, seems to affect the elimination of 
fidaxomicin and even more so OP-1118.  In the two Phase III clinical studies in patients with CDI, 
there were 12 patients with hepatic impairment, as determined by the finding of at least one liver 
function test at baseline of toxicity grade 2 or higher where PK data was available. PK data from these 
patients show mean fidaxomicin and OP-1118 levels approximately 2 times higher than those observed 
in patients with liver function test results of toxicity grade 1 or lower.

Amongst the cirrhotic subjects, plasma levels for fidaxomicin and OP-1118 were also presented based 
upon total bilirubin at baseline: <34, 34-50 and >50 µmol/L.  The data suggest increased exposure in 
patients with chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis, approximately 2-fold increase in fidaxomicin and 3-fold 
increase in OP-1118. 
Data are very limited but also suggest an increased exposure with increased bilirubin suggesting 
increased fidaxomicin and OP-1118 exposure in subjects with cholestasis. The applicant suggests 
caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Given the limited data and the difficulty in drawing 
conclusions regarding different stages of hepatic impairment caution should be advised also in patients 
with moderate hepatic impairment. 
Elderly 
Plasma levels also appear to be elevated in the elderly (age > 65 years). When phase III data is 
stratified for age over and under 65 years, fidaxomicin and OP-1118 levels are approximately 2 times 
higher for patients > 65 years compared to patients < 65 years.

Impaired renal function 
Further, there is no strong signal towards renal function influencing the elimination of fidaxomicin or 
OP-1118.  
Gender, weight, race  
There is also no influence of gender on the PK of fidaxomicin or OP-1118. 
Subgroup analyses by gender were carried out in the Phase 3 studies 101.1.C.003 and 101.1.C.004, 
there is no sign that gender would influence PK parameters. Limited data suggest that weight and race 
do not have any major influence on the plasma concentration of fidaxomicin or OP-1118.  
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Dificlir in children has not been established. A deferral on the obligation to 
submit studies from the paediatric population has been granted. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
The applicant has performed an ambitious in vitro programme concluding that systemic interactions 
due to CYP inhibition or induction are not likely given the presented data. 
However, the data from in vitro CYP inhibition studies cannot rule out that fidaxomicin and OP-1118 
inhibit gut CYP3A4 (which is present at significant levels) due to the locally high concentrations of 
fidaxomicin and OP-1118. In order to assess the magnitude of this interaction, the applicant was asked 
by CHMP to perform a clinical pharmacokinetic study assessing the interaction of fidaxomicin on a 
CYP3A4 probe substrate (e.g. oral midazolam). Further, the available in vitro data did also not rule out 
that fidaxomicin and OP-1118 may inhibit gut P-gp given the same argumentation as above. The 
inhibitory effect of fidaxomicin and OP-1118 on other intestinal transporters has not been investigated. 
The applicant is investigating the effect of fidaxomicin on MRPs, OATPs and BCRP transporters in vitro.  
Timelines have been provided, with final reporting scheduled for 4Q2011.  
During assessment of the dossier, the applicant also submitted three additional interaction studies. Co-
administration with a single dose of cyclosporine resulted in a 4.2- and 1.9-fold increase in fidaxomicin 
Cmax and AUC and 9.5- and 4.1-fold increase in OP-1118 Cmax and AUC. Half-life was not affected. 
Hence, the mechanism of the interaction seems to be increased absorption due to inhibition of 
transporter proteins, most likely P-gp, at intestinal level.  
Co-administration of the P-gp substrate digoxin with Dificlir (200 mg twice daily) in healthy volunteers 
resulted in an increase in digoxin Cmax of 14% and AUC of 12%.  
A cocktail interaction study was performed to assess the potential of fidaxomicin to alter the CYP-
mediated metabolism of S-warfarin, omeprazole, and midazolam which are probe substrates for 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4/5, respectively. The study results suggest that fidaxomicin has no 
clinically relevant effect on CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Fidaxomicin is a novel antibiotic agent representing a new class of 18-membered macrocyclic 
antibacterial drugs. It acts via inhibition of RNA synthesis by bacterial RNA polymerase at a distinct site 
from that of the currently used RNA polymerase inhibitors.  Inhibition of the clostridial RNA polymerase 
occurs at a concentration 20-fold lower than that for the E. coli enzyme (1 μM vs. 20 μM), partly 
Dificlir 
Assessment report  
Page 32/83
 
 
 
explaining the significant specificity of fidaxomicin activity. Its mechanism of action is distinct from that 
of any other class of antimicrobials.  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Fidaxomicin is a narrow spectrum antibacterial agent with almost no activity against gram-negative 
organisms (MIC50 and MIC90 values universally above 100 µg/mL) and moderate to good activity 
against gram-positive organisms, but with marked variation between genera.

The main metabolite, OP-1118 has a narrow spectrum of activity comparable to that of fidaxomicin, 
although with lower activity, with an MIC against C. difficile of 8 μg/mL. Given the high faecal 
concentrations of the metabolite, the activity versus C. difficile, and the low activity against other 
organisms, it can be concluded that the metabolite probably plays a role in the microbiologic activity of 
fidaxomicin. 
Data from a recent study, Tannock et al (2010), demonstrate that fidaxomicin’s sparing of flora is not 
limited to Gram-negative bacteria but is also sparing the predominant Gram-positive commensals.  
Using molecular methods, Day 1 and End of treatment faecal samples from 23 CDI subjects, who were 
recruited for the Phase 2 dose-ranging fidaxomicin clinical trial (50 mg, 100 mg, and 200 mg twice a 
day for 10 days), and a control group of 8 patients that received vancomycin (125 mg four times daily 
for 10 days) were analysed for the presence of various phylogenetic microbiota (Bacteroides-
Prevotella; Bifidobacterium; Atopobium; enterobacteria, clostridal clusters XIV and IV, and lactobacilli-
enterococci).  As these subjects entered the study with C. difficile infection (and thus abnormal flora at 
entry), day 365 stool samples were also analyzed to reflect the composition of the normal bowel flora 
and found to be similar to the composition of flora in the stools of eight healthy, untreated volunteers.  
Their data demonstrated little effect by fidaxomicin on the composition of the faecal microbiota in 
terms of its major phylogenetic clusters, which progressed during and after treatment toward a 
composition similar to that observed at day 365.  In addition, vancomycin treatment resulted in 
disruption of the major phylogens. 
Out of 248 patients tested for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) colonization before and after 
treatment in the 101.1.C.003 trial, patients treated with fidaxomicin had a lower likelihood of new 
colonization with VRE than patients treated with vancomycin (7% for fidaxomicin versus 31% for 
vancomycin, p < 0.001) [Nerandzic, 2009].  Among patients with pre-existing VRE, the mean 
concentration of VRE in their stool decreased significantly after 10 days of treatment in the fidaxomicin 
(5.9 versus 3.8 log10 VRE/g stool; P =0.01) but not the vancomycin group (5.3 versus 4.2 log10 VRE/g 
stool; P =0.20).

In vitro testing showed that fidaxomicin had a low level of spontaneous resistance rate, and cross-
resistance testing of fidaxomicin with other antibiotics showed a lack of cross-resistance towards other 
antibiotics tested, including macrolides, β-lactams, fluoroquinolones, rifamycins, vancomycin or 
metronidazole. Sequencing of laboratory-generated mutants with reduced fidaxomicin susceptibility 
has identified mutations in the target enzyme (RNA polymerase) similar to those identified in Bacillus 
strains with low susceptibility to lipiarmycin, a related compound. 
This microbiological activity covers the BI/027/NAP1 isolates which are epidemic hypervirulent C. 
difficile strains, while these bacteria are globally less susceptible to antibiotics. No difference between 
MICs according to serotypes, in particular BI, is observed. 
Regarding bactericidal kinetics, fidaxomicin and its metabolite have a bactericidal activity. The killing is 
time-dependant. Bactericidal activity is obtained in 6 to 24 hours for concentrations from 4 to 32 x 
MIC.  
Bactericidal activity for metronidazole is faster and more complete than this observed for fidaxomicin. 
Considering speed and degree of bactericidal activity, fidaxomicin is placed between metronidazole and 
vancomycin.  
In vitro, the inoculum, the presence of different concentrations of cations and the use of several 
collections of media have no impact on MICs. The only factors decreasing the in vitro fidaxomicin 
activity regarding C. difficile, are increased pH (> 7.2 to 7.9) and the faecal material, factors 
increasing MIC values up to 8-fold. But these findings should be considered regarding fidaxomicin 
faecal concentrations (up to 5 000 x MIC90 for C. difficile).  
Of interest, the applicant has tested the interaction between the excipients of the to-be-marketed 
formulation and the in vitro microbiological activity. There is a lack of drug-excipient interaction (same 
MICs or a difference of one dilution between presence and absence of excipients). 
Fidaxomicin and its main metabolite were demonstrated to have a significant post-antibiotic effect 
(PAE) against C. difficile.  At 4 times the MIC, the post-antibiotic effect is approximately 10 hours for 
fidaxomicin and 3 hours for OP-1118. 
Genotypically distinct strains of C. difficile have been shown to demonstrate a propensity to 
hypersporulate and have been reported to be responsible for outbreaks. The BI/NAP1 strain, like other 
outbreak strains, has demonstrated the capacity to hypersporulate compared with other non-outbreak 
strains. 
The action of fidaxomicin regarding recurrences is important taking into account the high rate of 
recurrences known with vancomycin and metronidazole (both drugs being known as favouring 
sporulation).  
In vitro sporulation inhibition studies have been conducted in hypervirulent C. difficile REA BI strain.  
Sub-MIC concentrations of fidaxomicin, OP-1118, vancomycin, or metronidazole were added to the 
culture 12 hours after inoculation (end of the log-phase growth period), and samples were collected at 
various time points thereafter and plated to quantify both total CFUs and spores.  Sub-MIC 
concentrations of fidaxomicin (Figure 2) and its major metabolite (OP-1118, Figure 3) inhibit spore 
formation in C. difficile.  In contrast, vancomycin and metronidazole do not inhibit sporulation.

The applicant also provided data showing that in contrast to vancomycin or metronidazole, fidaxomicin 
does inhibit production of toxins.  It has been demonstrated that fidaxomicin is able to inhibit toxin 
production in both hypervirulent UK1 strain (an epidemic 027 strain) and the VPI 10463 strain (ATCC 
43255, a high level toxin producing isolate).  Production of both Toxin A and Toxin B, measured via an 
ELISA method, was shown to be inhibited in the presence of sub-MIC concentrations of fidaxomicin.  In 
contrast, vancomycin or metronidazole did not inhibit production of either toxins.  In this study, 
fidaxomicin or other drugs were added at the beginning of stationary phase (24 hours after 
inoculation) and exposure continued through the following 7 days.  Samples were collected at 
timepoints following drug addition and assayed for toxins A and B via ELISA.  The drug concentrations 
used were 0.125 to 0.25 times the MIC, concentrations far below the fidaxomicin concentrations found

in the faeces following treatment.  Despite this, toxin production was nearly completely suppressed in 
the presence of fidaxomicin, even following 1 week of culture.  
The above findings were confirmed via examination of RNA transcripts in presence of fidaxomicin. 
However, the mechanism behind the inhibitory effect on toxins would deserve being elucidated through 
further investigation. 
Breakpoints 
Susceptibility patterns on baseline isolates from the clinical studies indicated the same range of MIC 
values as in published in vitro data. Since fidaxomicin in the treatment of CDI can be considered a 
topical agent and no clear relationship between exposure and efficacy has been demonstrated, it is 
agreed with the Applicant that clinical breakpoints seem not relevant. However, in order to be able to 
monitor any development of resistance, epidemiological breakpoints should be applied. Based on wild-
type distributions MIC data on fidaxomicin and C. difficile, an epidemiological cut-off value of 1.0 mg/L 
seems appropriate.  
Secondary pharmacology 
Fidaxomicin does not appear to have any significant effect on QTc intervals, which is in line with 
preclinical data. A trend for a dose related increase in QTc might be suspected from phase IIA study. 
Data from phase 3 studies did not indicate any clinical relevant effect on cardiac function.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The PK data presented in support of the application does not allow a full in vivo characterisation of the 
PK properties of fidaxomicin and its metabolites. Parts lacking for a full characterisation are mass 
balance data, absolute bioavailability data and protein binding data.  
As fidaxomicin is intended to act locally, it is not possible to draw any firm conclusions on the effect of 
food on other aspects than safety due to systemic exposure based on the food effect study. From this 
perspective, the difference between fasting and fed states is not clinically relevant. 
Plasma protein binding and binding within blood has not been studied. This is considered acceptable. 
As no mass balance study has been performed, it is not possible to conclude that OP-1118 is the only 
major metabolite formed in vivo. In response to CHMP request, the applicant has provided some 
additional information regarding known and expected metabolites in dog and human plasma, faeces 
and urine samples and dog bile. Based on these data it cannot be completely excluded that there may 
be any unknown metabolites formed with exposure greater than 10% of total drug-related exposure. 
However, in vitro data do not suggest any difference in metabolic profile between human and dog. 
Furthermore, the absorption is low and Dificlir is to be used only for 10 days. The lack of 
characterisation of the human metabolism can therefore be accepted 
Limited data suggest increased exposure in patients with chronic hepatitis cirrhosis, approximately 2-
fold increase in fidaxomicin and 3-fold increase in OP-1118. Very limited data also suggest an 
increased exposure with increased bilirubin suggesting increased fidaxomicin and OP-1118 exposure in 
subjects with cholestasis. Given the limited data and the difficulty in drawing conclusions regarding 
different stages of hepatic impairment, caution is advised in patient with moderate or severe hepatic 
impairment. The correlation between PK and age, where exposure is increased in the elderly, is likely 
not clinically relevant given the large inter individual variability in PK. Further, a considerable number 
of elderly patients were included in the phase III studies (median age was 63 years and 66 years in 
the two studies, respectively). 
There is a risk for interaction with P-gp inhibitors. Co-administration with a single dose of cyclosporine 
resulted in a 4.2- and 1.9-fold increase in fidaxomicin Cmax and AUC and 9.5- and 4.1-fold increase in 
OP-1118 Cmax and AUC. The applicant considers this increase in exposure not clinically meaningful as 
Dificlir 
Assessment report  
Page 36/83
 
 
 
adverse events were mild and mainly of gastrointestinal nature. However, it is difficult to draw 
conclusion regarding safety of increased exposure from an interaction study with a low number of 
subjects. Hence, co-administration of potent inhibitors of P-gp should be avoided. This is addressed in 
the RMP as important missing information and the applicant has included an appropriate statement in 
the SmPC. 
Co-administration of the P-gp substrate digoxin with Dificlir (200 mg twice daily) in healthy volunteers 
resulted in an increase in digoxin Cmax of 14% and AUC of 12%. The effect on digoxin is small and not 
considered clinically relevant. However, given the fairly high bioavailability of digoxin (about 60%), this 
is not a very sensitive substrate to evaluate the effect on P-gp in the intestine. A larger effect on more 
sensitive substrates with lower bioavailability such as dabigatranetexilat cannot be excluded. The 
observed interaction with digoxin is however very small. Based on this data, fidaxomicin is in vivo at 
most a mild to moderate P-gp inhibitor. 
Regarding PD, the narrow-spectrum in vitro activity of fidaxomicin and its high activity against the 
target pathogen C. difficile make this drug suitable for the treatment of CDI. Lack of cross-resistance 
with other classes of antimicrobial agents indicates a unique mode of action that is different from 
known RNA polymerase inhibitors. Since resistance against fidaxomicin seems primarily be due to 
single or multiple mutations in target genes, the rate of development of clinical significant resistance is 
hard to predict. Reassuringly, the high intestinal concentrations of fidaxomicin and the large marginal 
to inhibitory concentrations also against C. difficile first step mutants, may provide a sufficient mutant 
prevention concentration during the treatment period. However, susceptibility pattern of C. difficile to 
fidaxomicin should be closely monitored in the future. A post-marketing surveillance programme 
collecting clinical isolates from centres in Europe is planned to monitor strains of C. difficile for changes 
in antimicrobial resistance patterns.   
The Applicant has provided data supporting that treatment with fidaxomicin is less likely to cause 
intestinal colonization or overgrowth with VRE compared to treatment with vancomycin in CDI patients.  
The PK/PD parameter predictive of clinical success is suggested to be time over MIC value and not to 
be concentration dependent. Duration of a specific antibiotic concentration in the gastrointestinal tract 
may be very variable due to the character of diarrheal diseases, in which rapid intestinal transit may 
hasten faecal excretion of drug.  The feature of a significant post-antibiotic effect is favourable, 
indicating that the anti-clostridial activity of fidaxomicin persists also after its removal, which would be 
beneficial in C. difficile infection.  
The superiority over vancomycin in early recurrences, mainly during the first two weeks after EOT, as 
demonstrated in the clinical studies indicates that fidaxomicin also exerts a spore-killing effect, which 
was further supported by in vitro data.  
Susceptibility patterns on baseline isolates from the clinical studies indicated the same range of MIC 
values as in published in vitro data. Since fidaxomicin in the treatment of CDI can be considered a 
topical agent and no clear relationship between exposure and efficacy has been demonstrated, it is 
agreed with the Applicant that clinical breakpoints seem not relevant. However, in order to be able to 
monitor any development of resistance, epidemiological breakpoints should be applied. Based on wild-
type distributions MIC data on fidaxomicin and C. difficile, an epidemiological cut-off value of 1.0 
mg/L seems appropriate. The planned surveillance study will provide further information. 
It is reassuring that the quantitative counts of Bacteroides group during fidaxomicin treatment appear 
rather unaffected. This finding is in line with the spectrum of activity of fidaxomicin and its main 
metabolite (very low activity against Bacteriodes spp.). By using molecular methods to monitor 
alterations in the bowel microflora during and after fidaxomicin and vancomycin administration, 
fidaxomicin was shown to have a less marked effect also on major gram-positive phylogenetic clusters, 
such clostridia and bifidobacteria, compared to vancomycin. 
Dificlir

Fidaxomicin does not appear to have any significant effect on QTc intervals, which is in line with 
preclinical data. A trend for a dose related increase in QTc might be suspected from phase IIA study. 
Data from phase 3 studies did not indicate any clinical relevant effect on cardiac function.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetic documentation is considered sufficient.  
Regarding pharmacodynamics, fidaxomicin is a new anti-C. difficile agent with a unique bactericidal 
mechanism of action. Its pharmacodynamic properties are considered interesting for the treatment of 
patients with CDI, in particular due to the narrow-spectrum activity, spore-killing activity, post-
antibiotic effect and lack of cross-resistance to other classes of antibacterial drugs.  
In contrast to vancomycin or metronidazole, it is interesting to observe that fidaxomicin does inhibit 
production of toxins. 
The CHMP considers the following issues related to pharmacology: 
The applicant should provide the final reports for the in vitro studies investigating the effect of 
fidaxomicin on MRP2, OATP2B1 and BCRP by 4Q 2011 (RMP measure). 
The mechanism behind the inhibitory effect on toxins would deserve being elucidated through further 
investigation (Recommendation) 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
The Phase 2 A dose-finding study (OPT-80 Phase 2A) was an open-label, dose-ranging, randomised, 
safety and clinical evaluation of fidaxomicin tablets in patients with CDI. Fidaxomicin tablets were 
administered to patients at doses of 100 mg/day (50 mg q12h), 200 mg/day (100 mg q12h), and 400 
mg/day (200 mg q12h) for 10 days. The objective was to select the schedule regimen to be used in 
the Phase 3 studies. This study was conducted in mild to moderate CDI patients, with the following 
definition:  
  Diarrhoea (defined as a change in bowel habits, with 3 or more unformed bowel movements 
[UBMs] in 24 hours, or more than 6 loose or watery stools within 36 hours), and 
 
Presence of either toxin A or B of C. difficile in the stool. 
Regarding the primary study endpoints, results are as following:

Note: Clinical cure was imputed to failure for subjects who discontinued the study during treatment. 
Relief of symptoms of CDI was defined as ≤3 bowel movements per day without other associated signs and 
symptoms such as fever, abdominal pain and elevated white blood cells (WBC) by Day 10 of the study. 
Patients with any of these symptoms remaining by Day 10 were considered No Relief. 
Taking into account the limits of this study (critical methodology with an open-label trial, low number 
of patients-16 patients evaluated in each dose level-, different formulation as that used in Phase 3 
studies and in marketing), 400 mg/day (200 mg q 12h) has been considered as the most appropriate 
dose for the treatment of CDI in adults for the following reasons: the dose response for the relief of 
CDI was the most favourable response seen in the 400 mg/day treatment group. This treatment group 
showed no primary failures, shortest time to diarrhoea resolution, and highest percentage of patients 
totally free of CDI symptoms at EOT. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
The efficacy of fidaxomicin is supported by two multi-centre, double-blind, randomised, parallel group 
studies that used a non-inferiority design to compare the safety and efficacy of 400 mg/day 
fidaxomicin (200 mg q12h) with 500 mg/day vancomycin (125 mg q6h) for 10 days in patients with 
CDI (confirmed with positive toxin test).

Methods 
The designs of the two phase 3 studies were almost identical.  Study 04 included study sites from 
Europe and North America while study 03 only included sites from USA and Canada. Both studies 
Dificlir 
Assessment report  
Page 39/83
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
tested a non inferiority hypothesis with a 10% non inferiority margin (assumed to preserve 50% of the 
vancomycin absolute efficacy based on clinical trials in the setting). 
The selected dose of fidaxomicin, 200mg q12h, used in these phase 3 studies is supported by results 
observed with the Phase 2A study: no primary failures, shortest time to diarrhoea resolution, highest 
percentage of subjects totally free of CDI symptoms at EOT and is further reinforced by the reassuring 
microbiological finding on the bowel flora (with Bacteroides counts being used as a marker).  
Vancomycin served as comparator in both phase 3 studies which is endorsed since vancomycin is 
recommended for moderate to severe CDI and for recurrent episodes in many countries. The selected 
dose of vancomycin is in line with current recommendations and clinical practice.  
Study Participants  
Inclusion criteria included male or female adult inpatients or outpatients, who had CDI as defined by: 
  Diarrhoea : defined as a change in bowel habits, with > 3 unformed bowel movements (UBMs; or 
> 200ml unformed stool for subjects having rectal collection devices) in the 24 hours before 
randomisation, and 
 
Presence of either toxin A or B of C.difficile in the stool within 48 hours of randomisation. 
  ≤24 hours pre-treatment with CDI therapy. 
By the time of the original protocol there was a lack of validated severity scale for CDI. However, with 
the publication of results for the Phase 3 trial of tolevamer versus vancomycin and metronidazole 
(Louie 2007), it was decided to adopt a modified severity score based on the published CDI disease 
severity index, i.e.: 
 
 
 
-Mild CDI : 4-5 UBMs or WBC < 12,000/mm3 
-Moderate CDI : 6-9 UBMs or WBC > 12,001-15,000/mm3 
-Severe CDI :10+ UBMs or WBC > 15,001/mm3 
Any one of the 2 defining characteristics could have assigned a subject to a category, with a default to 
the more severe category when signs overlapped. 
Patients with life threatening or fulminant CDI (white blood cell [WBC] count >30 x109/L; temperature 
>40°C; or evidence of hypotension [systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg], and septic shock, 
peritoneal signs, or significant dehydration) or toxic megacolon were excluded from the study. Patients 
with multiple occurrences of CDI (defined as more than 1 prior occurrence within the past 3 months)  
and those suffering Crohn’s disease were also excluded. 
Treatments 
Patients were randomised to receive either fidaxomicin or vancomycin. Subjects allocated to 
fidamoxicin received either a 200-mg capsule fidamoxicin BID with intermittent matching placebo 
doses also administered BID for a total of 4 capsules per day.  Vancomycin subjects received 125-mg 
capsules QID. 
Objectives 
The primary objectives of the phase 3 studies were to 
  Demonstrate that the cure rate of CDI following treatment with fidaxomicin is non-inferior to that 
following treatment with vancomycin. 
Dificlir 
Assessment report  
Page 40/83
 
 
 
  Evaluate the safety and tolerability of fidaxomicin in subjects with CDI. 
The secondary objective was to 
  Evaluate the rate of recurrence and global cure rates of CDI following treatment of fidaxomicin 
compared with vancomycin. 
Subjects were randomised and stratified at each site on the basis of either having a single prior 
episode within 3 months or having no prior occurrence within the last 3 months. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Definition of the analysis populations 
The mITT Population for Cure was the group of subjects with CDI confirmed by positive toxin 
assay and who received at least 1 dose of study medication. 
The mITT Population for Recurrence was the group of subjects in the mITT Population for Cure 
who were classified as cured at the end of therapy. 
The PP Population for Cure was the group of subjects included in the mITT population who met 
the following criteria (referred to as the Microbiologically Evaluable Population in the protocol and 
SAP): 
  Met all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria  
  Subjects required at least 3 complete days for failures and 8 complete days for cures  
  Had an EOT clinical evaluation 
  Did not have significant protocol violations  
The PP Population for Recurrence was the group of subjects in the PP Population for Cure who: 
  Were cured at EOT 
  Were followed for recurrence up to the post-study visit or experienced a recurrence ≤30 days 
post treatment and 
  Did not use concomitant CDI therapy or other drugs which could have confounded the 
assessment of recurrence. 
Primary efficacy variable 
 
The primary cure rate in the PP population and mITT populations. 
Secondary efficacy variables 
 
The recurrence rate in the PP and mITT populations (studies 03 and 04).  
  Global cure rate in the PP and mITT populations (study 04). 
Explorative variables 
  Global cure rate in the PP and mITT populations (study 03). 
 
Time-to-resolution of diarrhoea (TTRD) (studies 03 and 04). 
Cure was defined as: 
Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator required no further CDI therapy 2 days after 
completion of study medication. 
Dificlir 
Assessment report  
Page 41/83
 
 
 
Subjects who had 3 or fewer unformed stools for 2 consecutive days and remained well before the time 
of study medication discontinuation were considered cured. Subjects who were considered cured based 
on stabilization and improvement in CDI signs and symptoms were evaluated 2 to 3 days after the end 
of therapy. If they remained stable and were not considered to require further CDI therapy to maintain 
their stable state, they were to be followed for recurrence as cures. 
Subjects who had rectal collection devices were considered to have resolution of diarrheal when the 
volume (over a 24-hour period) was decreased by 75% compared with the volume observed at 
admission or when the subject was no longer passing liquid stools. 
Failure was defined as: 
Subjects who in the opinion of the Investigator required additional CDI therapy were considered 
failures. 
The Investigator based clinical impressions of the need for additional CDI therapy on subjects’ CDI 
status, inclusive of the presence of diarrhoea and other signs and symptoms of CDI including: 
Fever >38.0°C, not attributable to another clear aetiology (e.g., pneumonia) 
Elevated WBC count >13,000/μL not attributable to another clear aetiology (e.g., pneumonia) 
Abdominal pain of moderate or greater severity lasting 1 hour or more and/or abdominal tenderness of 
at least moderate severity, including any peritoneal signs. 
Recurrence was defined as 
A re-establishment of diarrhoea within 30 days post treatment, to an extent that was greater than the 
frequency noted on the last day of study medication with the demonstration of either toxin A or B (or 
both) of C. difficile. The recurrence also must have, in the Investigator’s opinion, required retreatment 
with CDI anti-infective therapy. Among recurrence, relapse and re-infection could not be distinguished, 
apart indirectly from time of occurrence (re-infection being more likely when occurring beyond 14 days 
post treatment). 
Global cure rate was defined as 
The number of subjects in each treatment group who had been evaluated as cured and who did not 
have a recurrence within 30 days after discontinuation of treatment. 
Time-to-resolution of diarrhoea (TTROD) was defined as  
The time elapsing (days and hours) from start of treatment to resolution of diarrhoea (first of  2 
consecutive days of ≤3 UBMs that are then sustained through EOT). 
The primary endpoint and definition of clinical cure is considered clinically relevant  and has been 
previously used in large CDI studies and are in accordance with the recent ESCMID guidance document 
for CDI (2009). No biological or microbiological endpoint has yet been shown to correlate sufficiently 
well with clinical outcome. TTROD is an interesting endpoint since the anticipated cure rate at day 10 is 
expected to be very high (>90%) meaning that time to resolution may be discriminatory between 
treatments. The endpoint global cure is considered very important since this endpoint may be 
considered most meaningful for the patient.  
Sample size 
Studies 03 and 04: 
The sample size calculation was based on the non-inferior comparison of fidaxomicin with vancomycin 
in the cure rate at the EOT visit for the PP population.  The calculation assumed power of 90% and 
Dificlir 
Assessment report  
Page 42/83
 
 
 
2.5% (1-sided) Type I error rate. A non-inferiority margin of 10% was assumed. It was also assumed 
that the cure rates of fidaxomicin and vancomycin in a population with confirmed CDI meeting the 
study’s entry criteria were both equal to 85%. The choice of a cure rate of 85% for vancomycin was 
chosen as the median value of the cure rates from 7 active-comparator studies evaluated in the 
Cochrane Review of published studies of CDI. A placebo response rate of 10% to 20% is estimated 
based on limited clinical and historical data. 
Study 04: 
 In study 04, prior to study database lock and unblinding, results from study 03 initiated a blinded 
sample size re-assessment for this study and the assumptions for cure and evaluability were updated 
to a 90% cure rate and an 85% evaluability rate. Based on these new assumptions, the sample size 
needed for assessment of non-inferiority in cure rates was approximately 483 subjects. Hence, study 
enrolment for study 04 was stopped in November 2009. 
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomized and stratified at each site on the basis of, either having a single prior 
episode within 3 months, or having no prior occurrence within the last 3 months. 
Blinding (masking) 
Throughout the treatment period, each subject took blinded study medication orally q6h (QID; 40 
doses). Vancomycin, fidaxomicin, and matching placebo capsules were overencapsulated to appear 
identical and were packaged in blister cards. 
Statistical methods 
Methods of analysis for the primary endpoint: 
A non-inferiority design was used to demonstrate the efficacy of fidaxomicin compared to vancomycin 
using a 2-sided 95% CIs for the difference between treatment groups, where the lower limit of the 2-
sided 95% CI is -10%. 
Secondary and explorative endpoints: 
Clinical recurrence: Two-sided 95% CIs were presented in addition to the point estimates of recurrence 
rates for each treatment group. A time-to-recurrence analysis was also conducted, and defined as the 
time in days from the last date of dosing to the assessment date of recurrence. This analysis only 
included patients who were considered cured at the EOT visit. 
Global Cure: A similar approach as performed for clinical recurrences was used. 
Time to resolution of diarrhoea: Summary statistics for the TTROD were provided for each treatment 
group, and included the numbers of patients whose diarrhoea resolved, number censored, median time 
to resolution (50th percentile), and 95% CIs on the median time to resolution. Diarrhoea that did not 
resolve by Day 10 was censored on Day 10 (last day of bowel movement collection on the diary). In 
addition, patients who withdrew were censored on Day 10.

General Protocol Amendments 
Study 03: 
There were 4 amendments of the protocol. All changes were implemented during enrolment before the 
breaking of the blind. Only the most important changes are listed below. 
Amendment 1 (30 April 2006): 
  Modified efficacy criteria to reflect stabilization and improvement in CDI signs and symptoms. 
  Modified definition of SAEs. 
  Modified the time period for observation of AEs such that the observation period for AEs now 
started at the time informed consent was obtained and lasted through 7 days after the last dose of 
study drug or until the last protocol-specified study visit, whichever occurred later. 
Amendment 2 (20 December 2006): 
  Modified inclusion criterion 1 to include the presence of either toxin A or B of C. difficile in the stool 
within 48 hours of randomization. 
  Added two additional inclusion criteria: permitting use of opiates if the subject was on a stable 
dose at randomization, and permitting enrolment if subject had failed a full course of 
metronidazole yet continued to experience diarrhoea as defined in the protocol while remaining 
toxin positive.

Amendment 3 (14 February 2008): 
  Revised the definition of diarrhoea to add a definition for subjects using a rectal collection device. 
The revised definition was a change in bowel habits, with >3 UBM (or >200 mL of unformed stool 
for subjects having rectal collection devices) in the 24 hours before randomization. 
Amendment 4 (5 June 2008): 
  Added procedures to follow in the event of an increase in QTc interval ≥60 msec above baseline or 
>500 msec after treatment to Safety Evaluations. 
Study 04: 
There were 5 protocol amendments for German sites and 4 for other sites. All changes were 
implemented during enrolment before the breaking of the blind. Only important changes not already 
listed for study 03 are listed below. 
Amendment 2 (German sites) 29 May, 2007): 
 
Inclusion criterion 1 was changed to indicate that subjects had to be 18 years of age or older. 
Important amendments to SAP (studies 03 and 04) 
  Added baseline disease severity as a summary variable within demographics and baseline 
characteristics; added additional subgroups to summaries of cure rates. 
  Added categorization of strains (BI/NAP1 versus non-BI/NAP1); added baseline severity and MIC to 
the analysis and added a diagnostics analysis to examine correlation of variables in the logistic 
regression model; updated subgroups for the logistic regression model. 
Study 04 (3 December 2009): Changed global cure from an exploratory endpoint to a secondary 
efficacy endpoint. 
Baseline data 
The treatment groups were generally comparable for demographic characteristics within each study. A 
considerable number of elderly patients were included, median age was 63 years and 66 years in the 
two studies, respectively. 
Compliance in both the phase 3 studies was high with at least 91% of prescribed doses taken in both 
studies and treatment groups. 
In both studies a reasonably limited number of patients prematurely withdrew the study (around 
10%).  
The reasons for non evaluable patients for the PP analysis were not given. However, this should have 
been displayed especially in the light of the apparent imbalance between the two treatment arms in 
study C004 (20% in the fidaxomicin arm vs. 11% in the vancomycin arm). This issue was raised by 
CHMP. It was finally admitted that given the small imbalance and the confidence intervals for cure 
rates and recurrence rates, the results are unlikely to be affected.

Baseline characteristics were generally comparable for patients enrolled in the two phase 3 studies, 
although the patients in study 04 tended to have more severe CDI than those in study 03 on the basis 
of more inpatients. The prior use of antibiotics in study 04 was twice the rate as compared to study 03.

The applicant was asked to further characterize the degree of severity of the enrolled population, 
notably to specify the number of patients with pseudomembranous colitis.  The applicant stated that 
only 8 patients had pseudomembranous colitis (5 in the fidaxomicin and 3 in the vancomycin arms 
respectively).  Moreover, it was clarified that CDI requiring ICU hospitalisation was not recorded in the 
trials. Overall, the relatively limited experience in severely ill patients, including subjects with 
pseudomembranous colitis is added to the SmPC. This population will have to be closely monitored 
through the RMP.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
The clinical cure rates in both the PP and mITT populations were similar in both phase 3 studies. The 
95% CI lower limit was well above the non-inferiority margin of -10%, demonstrating the 
non-inferiority of fidaxomicin relative to vancomycin. For both studies, the point estimate consistently 
favours the fidaxomicin arm whatever the population.  Similar results were seen in sensitivity analyses 
using a modified endpoint based strictly on the objective measure of resolution of diarrhoea (i.e., ≤ 3 
UBMs during treatment that was sustained to the EOT visit), with a difference of 1.86 in favour of 
fidaxomicin (95% CIs -2.94, 6.62) being seen in the PP population.

Secondary endpoints 
In both studies the recurrence rate was significantly lower in the fidaxomicin groups compared to the 
vancomycin groups. The 95% CIs did not contain the value of zero, indicating superiority of 
fidaxomicin over vancomycin in the risk of recurrence. Analysis of time to recurrence showed that 
patients treated with fidaxomicin experienced recurrence of CDI later than patients treated with 
vancomycin (estimated 10% of vancomycin-treated patients had recurrence by Day 8 post-dose versus 
20 days for fidaxomicin-treated patients p = 0.003).

In line with this, the global cure rate in patients treated with fidaxomicin was statistically and clinically 
superior to patients treated with vancomycin.

The activity of fidaxomicin on recurrence was most pronounced in the initial two weeks after 
completing therapy, when only 7.4% of patients treated initially with fidaxomicin experienced a 
recurrence compared with 19.3% of those treated initially with vancomycin (p<0.001).  In the 
following two-week period, the recurrence rates were similar: 6.6% for those originally treated with 
fidaxomicin compared with 8.1% for those treated with vancomycin (p=0.402).  Thus, these results 
indicate that fidaxomicin reduces the risk for relapses (early recurrence, < 2 weeks from EOT) while 
there was a similar rate of late recurrences (probable re-infections) in both treatment arms.

There was no significant difference in time to resolution of diarrhoea (TTROD) between the treatment 
groups. 
Subgroup analyses 
Subgroup analyses indicated an association with cure rate in a number of subgroup variables, such as 
age (worse outcome for the elderly), baseline severity of disease, concomitant systemic antibiotic 
therapy (worse outcome if yes), status of patients (worse outcome in inpatients) as well as type of 
initial C. difficile strain (worse outcome for BI strains). These observations were generally as expected 
based on clinical experience and were observed in both treatment groups. For each of these subgroup 
variables, there did not appear to be any marked difference between treatment groups in observed 
cure rates.  Regarding countries where patients were included, United States sites combined had a 
lower cure rate than those in Canada. This difference is likely explained by the predominance of 
outpatients treated at the Canadian sites. Fidaxomicin treated patients were generally associated with 
a numerically higher cure rate than vancomycin in the pooled analysis in most of the subgroups, 
including age ≥ 65 and inpatient status. 
Subgroup analyses of recurrences and global cure rates indicated consistent numerical superior 
outcome for fidaxomicin treated patients also in subgroups generally associated with inferior cure 
rates, including advanced age, prior episode of CDI, CDI antibiotic within 24 hours of study initiation, 
concomitant systemic antibiotic and inpatient status. In the pooled analyses of the phase 3 studies, 
patients with BI strain at baseline had numerically fewer recurrences if treated with fidaxomicin 
compared to vancomycin. 
Microbiological outcome 
No relationship between MIC and outcome was identified in fidaxomicin treated patients. The 
hypervirulent BI strain which is associated with outbreaks of severe disease was included as a 
subgroup in the outcome analyses. The BI strain trend was towards poorer outcomes and higher MIC 
values. However, even at the same MIC value as for non-BI strains, BI strains performed worse, thus 
the difference in outcome with the BI strain does not appear to be an MIC effect.

In all but one of the 31 fidaxomicin-treated patients with strains isolated post-treatment at failure or 
recurrence the final strain had the same MIC as the baseline strain (or was within a dilution of the 
baseline strain). One patient in study 04 had a baseline isolate with MIC 0.06 µg/mL. The subject was 
a cure but culture was positive at EOT with unchanged MIC. Later the subject recurred with a strain 
with a MIC of 16 µg/mL. REA typing methods could not discriminate whether this was the initial strain 
(recrudescence) or an infection with a new strain. 
Based on available data from the phase 3 studies no correlation between faecal concentrations, MIC 
and outcome could be demonstrated. Thus faecal concentration/MIC does not appear to be a predictive 
pharmacodynamic parameter. However due to limited number of faecal samples at EOT, especially in 
patients with failure and large variations between individuals, these data is not considered conclusive.  
Ancillary analyses 
Additional analysis was carried out using the ESCMID categories of severe and non-severe CDI using 
the pooled data from the two phase 3 studies. The ESCMID definitions of severe CDI used in the 
analysis were based on: fever (core body temperature > 38.5°C); marked leucocytosis (leukocyte 
count >15x109/L) and rise in serum creatinine (≥ 1.5 mg/dL).  According to the ESCMID criteria 
approximately 25% of the mITT patient population were classified as severe CDI. The results in the 
severe and non-severe categories reflected the same trends as seen for the main analysis. Patients 
with non-severe CDI responded better for clinical cure rates than patients with severe CDI, regardless 
of treatment group. For recurrence rates in the fidaxomicin group, similar percentages of patients in 
the severe and non-severe CDI groups had a recurrence of infection, while in the vancomycin group 
patients with severe CDI were more likely to have a recurrence of infection.

Non-inferiority – A lower limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) 
for the difference in treatment cure rates (fidaxomicin - vancomycin) greater 
than -10% would demonstrate non-inferiority and the efficacy of fidaxomicin 
in the treatment of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI).

Definition: Cure 
  Subjects who, in the opinion of the 
Investigator, required no further CDI 
therapy 2 days after completion of study 
medication were considered cured. 
Subjects who had 3 or fewer unformed 
stools for 2 consecutive days and remained 
well before the time of study medication 
discontinuation were considered cured. 
  Alternatively, subjects who at the end of 
treatment had a marked reduction in the 
number of unformed stools but who had 
residual and mild abdominal discomfort 
interpreted as recovering bowel by the 
Investigator could be considered cured at 
that time providing no new anti-infective 
CDI therapy was required. Subjects who 
were considered cured based on 
stabilization and improvement in CDI signs 
and symptoms were evaluated 2 to 3 days 
after the end of study medication. In the 
event that their signs or symptoms of CDI 
worsened, subjects were to be designated 
primary failures. If they remained stable 
and were not considered to require further 
CDI therapy to maintain their stable state, 
they were to be followed for recurrence as 
cures.

Recurrence 
rate 
The recurrence rate of CDI by 28 days ±2 
days after the last dose of study therapy was 
computed for both PP and mITT populations. 
Definition: Recurrence 
  The re-establishment of diarrhoea to an 
extent (frequency of passed unformed 
stools) that was greater than that noted on 
the last day of study medication with the 
demonstration of either toxin A or B or 
both of C. difficile and that, in the 
Investigator’s opinion, required 
retreatment with CDI anti-infective 
therapy. Subjects being considered for 
recurrence must have had positive toxin 
demonstrated in the stool. If a rapid 
screening test was used and failed to 
demonstrate toxin, a confirmatory test 
using a non-rapid kit method was to be 
used. 
The global cure rate (percent of subjects who 
were cured and did not experience a 
recurrence) was computed for both PP and 
mITT populations. 
Definition: Global cure 
  Subject who had been evaluated as cured 
at the end of therapy (EOT) and did not 
have recurrence at any time up to the 
post-study visit.

Hypothesis 
Treatments groups 
Non-inferiority – A lower limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) 
for the difference in treatment cure rates (fidaxomicin - vancomycin) greater 
than -10% would demonstrate non-inferiority and the efficacy of fidaxomicin 
in the treatment of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI).

Definition: Cure 
•  Subjects who, in the opinion of the 
Investigator, required no further CDI 
therapy 2 days after completion of study 
medication were considered cured. 
Subjects who had 3 or fewer unformed 
stools for 2 consecutive days and remained 
well before the time of study medication 
discontinuation were considered cured. 
  Alternatively, subjects who at the end of 
treatment had a marked reduction in the 
number of unformed stools but who had 
residual and mild abdominal discomfort 
interpreted as recovering bowel by the 
Investigator could be considered cured at 
that time providing no new anti-infective 
CDI therapy was required. Subjects who 
were considered cured based on 
stabilization and improvement in CDI signs 
and symptoms were evaluated 2 to 3 days 
after the end of study medication. In the 
event that their signs or symptoms of CDI 
worsened, subjects were to be designated 
primary failures. If they remained stable 
and were not considered to require further 
CDI therapy to maintain their stable state, 
they were to be followed for recurrence as 
cures.

Secondary 
endpoint 
Recurrence 
rate 
The recurrence rate of CDI by 28 days ±2 
days after the last dose of study therapy was 
computed for both PP and mITT populations. 
Definition: Recurrence 
  The re-establishment of diarrhoea to an 
extent (frequency of passed unformed 
stools) that was greater than that noted on 
the last day of study medication with the 
demonstration of either toxin A or B or 
both of C. difficile and that, in the 
Investigator’s opinion, required 
retreatment with CDI anti-infective 
therapy. Subjects being considered for 
recurrence must have had positive toxin 
demonstrated in the stool. If a rapid 
screening test was used and failed to 
demonstrate toxin, a confirmatory test 
using a non-rapid kit method was to be 
used. 
The global cure rate (percent of subjects who 
were cured and did not experience a 
recurrence) was computed for both PP and 
mITT populations. 
Definition: Global cure 
  Subject who had been evaluated as cured 
at the end of therapy (EOT) and did not 
have recurrence at any time up to the 
post-study visit.

Note: Both secondary endpoints used a Chi-square test of difference in 
proportions to test the superiority of fidaxomicin versus vancomycin, along 
with 2-sided 95% CIs being reported for the difference in treatment groups. 
A gate-keeping strategy was employed to maintain overall error rate for 
testing secondary endpoints.

Clinical studies in special populations 
There are no studies performed in special populations. Regarding elderly, patients with hepatic or renal 
impairment, such patients included in Phase 3 studies have been identified and PK results have been 
observed. Efficacy data depending on age can be observed in efficacy results. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The clinical development programme included two well conducted Phase III clinical trials.   
The inclusion and exclusion criteria for the phase 3 studies are considered acceptable and in line with 
previous CDI studies. The studied patient population was generally representative for the target 
population, including a high number of elderly patients with almost 50% being 65 years or older. 
Although more than 70% of included patients were considered by the investigators to have moderate 
to severe infection, there is a lack experience in seriously ill patients. For example, very few (5) 
patients of the fidaxomicin treated patients had a diagnosis of pseudomembranous colitis. 
The applicant was asked to further characterize the degree of severity of the enrolled population, 
notably to specify the number of patients with pseudomembranous colitis. In response, the applicant 
stated that only 8 patients had pseudomembranous colitis (5 in the fidaxomicin and 3 in the 
vancomycin arms respectively). Moreover, it was clarified that CDI requiring ICU hospitalisation was 
not recorded in the trials. Overall, the relatively limited experience in severely ill patients, including 
subjects with pseudomembranous colitis is stated in the SmPC. This population will have to be closely 
monitored through the RMP 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The two randomised double-blind controlled phase 3 trials in patients with mild to moderately severe 
C. difficile infection demonstrated non-inferiority of fidaxomicin compared to vancomycin in the 
primary efficacy variable, clinical cure at end of therapy, and superiority in the secondary endpoints 
recurrence rate and global cure rate within 36 to 40 days after initiation of treatment. 
According to subgroup analyses a number of variables showed an association with cure rate in the 
mITT and PP populations, such as age, baseline severity of disease, inpatient or outpatient status, as 
well as type of initial C. difficile strain. These observations were as expected based on clinical 
experience and were observed in both treatment groups. For each of these subgroup variables, there 
did not appear to be any marked difference between treatment groups in observed cure rates and non-
inferiority to vancomycin was demonstrated. Gender or ethnicity did not have an impact on the clinical 
response. There were no significant differences between treatment groups regarding time to resolution 
of diarrhoea in either of the two phase 3 studies. 
The recurrence rates within 30 days post-treatment were consistently significantly higher in the 
vancomycin groups compared to the fidaxomicin groups in both the PP and mITT populations. 
Subgroup analyses indicated consistent numerical superior outcome for fidaxomicin treated patients 
also in subgroups generally associated with inferior cure rates, including high age, prior episode of 
CDI, concomitant systemic antibiotic and inpatient status. Similar results were obtained regardless of 
prior antibiotic therapy against CDI (maximum 24 hours). Also global cure rates were significantly 
more favourable for fidaxomicin treated patients. Global cure is considered a very crucial endpoint 
since this endpoint may be considered most meaningful for the patient, taking the high recurrence 
rates after current available therapeutic options into account (20 to 30% recurrence rates have been 
Dificlir 
Assessment report  
Page 62/83
 
 
 
reported after initial successful treatment with metronidazole or vancomycin [Aslam S et al. Lancet 
Infect. Dis. 2005; 5(9); 549-557]). The superiority of fidaxomicin compared to vancomycin regarding 
recurrences, were mainly due to a reduction of early recurrences (< 2 weeks after EOT).  Even if 
molecular typing were not successful in distinguishing between relapse and reinfection, it is widely 
acknowledged that relapses with the original strain mainly occur within 14 days after end of treatment. 
Thus, available study data indicate a significant effect on relapses (recurrence < two weeks), but not 
on probable re-infections (recurrences > 2 weeks after EOT). This is further supported by the fact that 
fidaxomicin exerts a limited effect on the normal microflora and also by the probable antispore effect, 
both features that would minimize relapses 
Fidaxomicin may be considered a topical agent and no correlation between baseline MIC values, faecal 
concentrations and outcome could be demonstrated. The trend for patients infected with the 
hypervirulent BI (027) strain that is associated with outbreaks of severe disease was towards poorer 
outcomes and higher MIC values. However, even at the same MIC value as for non-BI strains, BI 
strains performed worse, thus the difference in outcome with the BI strain does not appear to be an 
MIC effect. Patients harbouring the BI strain randomised to fidaxomicin performed at least as well for 
the primary endpoint. The two phase 3 studies are not superimposable as regards the global cure rate. 
Depending on the study results on BI either favour the vancomycin arm (C003) or the fidaxomicin arm 
(C004). Some clarifications were requested to better interpret the outcome depending on the BI/non 
BI strain. In response the applicant underlined that the numbers of patients with BI was small, 
representing approximately one third of the isolable strains (and one quarter of the subjects in the 
studies), and sample size of the trials could not allow to reliably detect differences within the BI 
subgroup. It was acknowledged that within the subset of patients with BI the cure rates were similar 
between fidaxomicin (FDX) and vancomycin (VAN) arms. 
As underlined by the applicant, physicians will not know the strain type at the time of diagnosis and 
that subjects without non-BI strains represent the majority of strains in Europe [Hensgens, 2009; UK 
HSC Public Health Agency, 2010] and in this population better outcomes where reported with 
fidaxomicin vs. vancomycin.   
C. difficile associated diarrhoea may manifest from mild disease where termination of ongoing 
antibiotic therapy will be sufficient for cure, to severe and fulminant cases requiring intensive care. 
Unfortunately, there is no validated severity index for CDI. In the present study patients were 
categorized by the investigators as mild, moderate or severe cases. A high number of elderly patients 
were included. Although not completely standardised, baseline characteristics indicate that a 
substantial number of patients with severe disease were included, also supported by the post-study 
analysis according to ESCMID criteria (25% having severe disease in both treatment groups). 
However, only one of several alternative criteria was to be fulfilled for classification of “severe CDI“.   
A very important future patient population where current treatment options have clear short-comings 
is subjects with previous multiple occurrences of CDI. However, patients with multiple occurrences of 
CDI (defined as more than 1 prior occurrence within the past 3 months) were excluded from the 
studies, which should be stated in the SmPC. This group of patients currently constitutes a real clinical 
challenge and there is an urgent need for improved treatment alternatives leading to sustained cure. 
Data from the present studies indicate that the clinical outcome were similar in patients with one 
previous  CDI episode within 3 months of inclusion compared to those without previous CDI episode 
within this time frame.  Furthermore, no data on repeated treatment with fidaxomicin have been 
presented.  
As part of the RMP, the applicant committed to set up a post-marketing surveillance programme to 
monitor isolated strains of C.difficile for changes in antimicrobial resistance patterns, a post-marketing 
Dificlir 
Assessment report  
Page 63/83
 
 
 
clinical study to investigate the (safety and) efficacy of repeated use of fidaxomicin and a post 
marketing drug utilization study to further assess the use of fidaxomicin in standard clinical practice.   
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of fidaxomicin in the treatment of patients with single episodes of mild to moderately 
severe non-recurrent C. difficile associated disease is considered satisfactorily demonstrated by the 
submitted data.  Based on efficacy data, fidaxomicin seems to have the potential to offer a valuable 
alternative in the treatment of CDI, in particular considering the favourable effect on relapses and the 
unique mode of action suggesting a limited potential for promotion of resistance against established 
antibiotic classes. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The safety of fidaxomicin has been evaluated in three phase 1 studies in healthy subjects, one phase 
2A dose-finding study conducted in patients with CDI and two phase 3 studies conducted in patients 
with CDI. In all studies, the safety population was defined as the patient population that received at 
least one dose of treatment with the study drug fidaxomicin, or with the comparator vancomycin or 
placebo. In the phase 1 studies, 64 subjects received at least one dose fidaxomicin. A total of 660 
patients with C. difficile associated diarrhoea were treated with at least one dose fidaxomicin and up to 
10 days. Of the 1195 patients with CDI randomized to treatment (fidaxomicin or vancomycin) 580 
(48.5%) were aged ≥ 65 years which are considered appropriate considering the nature of the disease. 
Adverse events  
Phase 2 study 
Fidaxomicin was well tolerated by all patients after 10 days consecutive dosing at 100 to 400 mg/day. 
Overall, 9 (18.8%) of the patients reported AEs during the study. The proportion of patients reporting 
AEs was not dose dependent. No subjects withdrew due to AEs. None of the AEs in study OPT-80 Phase 
2A was judged related to study drug by the investigator.  
Phase 3 studies 
In each of the studies and in the pooled data, the overall incidence of treatment-emerging adverse 
events (TEAEs) was similar between the two treatment groups. When comparing the two individual 
studies, it appeared that patients enrolled in both groups in trial 04 experienced more TEAEs than 
patients randomised in 03 study: 62.3 % FID and 60.4 % VAN versus 70.5 % FID and 68.1 % VAN, 
respectively. This difference in TEAEs rates was noteworthy for gastrointestinal disorders (especially 
abdominal pain and constipation, abdominal distension and flatulence), fatigue and ECG QT prolonged. 
In contrast, peripheral oedema, pyrexia and dyspnoea were more frequently reported in study 03 than 
in study 04. 
The most frequent preferred terms in the pooled analysis were nausea, hypokalaemia, vomiting, 
abdominal pain and headache. The TEAEs which occurred more frequently in patients treated with 
fidaxomicin than vancomycin in the pooled analysis (i.e., ≥ 2% difference between the treatment 
groups) were abdominal pain (5.7% versus 3.1%), and constipation (3.7%versus 1.7%). Several of 
these reported AEs like nausea, abdominal pain and hypokalaemia are symptoms of the underlying 
disease. Treatment-related adverse events were reported by 11% of the patients, generally equally 
distributed in the two treatment groups. The most frequent drug-related TEAE in the pooled analysis 
Dificlir 
Assessment report  
Page 64/83
 
 
 
was nausea (3.4% vancomycin; 2.7% fidaxomicin). There were no major differences between the 
fidaxomicin and vancomycin treatment groups in the type of TEAEs considered drug-related by the 
investigators. The incidence of treatment-related dizziness was higher in the fidaxomicin group 
compared to the vancomycin group (5 vs. 1), mainly driven by results from study 03. This AE is listed 
in section 4.8 of the SmPC.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
There were no deaths or serious adverse events (SAE) among the healthy subjects in the phase 1 
studies. In study OPT-80 Phase 2A, one patient died during the study due to a staphylococcal sepsis 
and a cerebral haemorrhage on Day 10, leading to death on Day 16. These events were considered by 
the investigator to be unrelated to study drug.  Five patients were reported as having SAEs during the 
phase 2 study. In the 100 mg/day treatment group, one patient had diarrhoea (subsequently 
diagnosed as nephrolithiasis) of moderate severity and another had severe exacerbation of congestive 
heart failure. In the 200 mg/day treatment group, one patient had a GI haemorrhage of moderate 
severity, and another patient had chest pain of moderate severity. No patients in the 400 mg 
treatment group had an SAE. All SAEs reported in the phase 2 study were considered to be unrelated 
to study drug. 
In the pooled phase 3 studies, a total of 38 and 36 deaths occurred among patients treated with 
vancomycin and fidaxomicin, respectively. The most common cause of death was sepsis, which was 
the cause of death for 7 patients (4 in the vancomycin group and 3 in the fidaxomicin group): followed 
by respiratory failure in 6 patients (2 versus 4), and pneumonia in 5 patients (2 versus 3). None of the 
deaths were considered to be related to administration of the study drug.   
The overall incidence of SAEs in both studies was similar between the two treatment groups. About one 
quarter of patients experienced SAEs in both groups. FID-patients tended to experience more blood 
disorders (especially neutropenia, leucopenia), vascular disorders (1.8 % versus 0.7 %), AEs related to 
the SOC “Investigations” (blood uric acid increased and lymphocyte count), hyponatraemia, 
hypophosphataemia and hyperkalaemia. Only a low number of SAEs was considered as treatment-
related: 4 patients in the FID-group. A causal relationship cannot be firmly excluded although patients’ 
history and the concomitant/underlying medical conditions appeared as important confounding factors.  
Regarding GI bleedings, regardless of causal relationship, 7 (1.2 %) cases of haematochezia were 
reported in FID-patients [versus 1 (0.2 %) in the VAN-group], 5 (0.9 %) cases of gastrointestinal 
haemorrhage [versus 1 (0.2 %) in the VAN-group], 4 (0.7 %) cases of diarrhoea haemorrhagic [versus 
none in the VAN-group], 1 case (0.2 %) of rectal haemorrhage [versus 2 (0.3 %) in the VAN-group] 
and no upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage [versus 1 (0.2 %) in the VAN-group]. An extended safety 
analysis in patients with gastro-intestinal bleeding events in the pooled data demonstrated that the 
incidence of all GI bleeding events was comparable between treatment groups, 4.1% in the fidaxomicin 
group vs. 3.1% in the vancomycin group. More than half of the GI bleeding events in both treatment 
groups occurred more than 5 days after the last dose of study drug.  Amongst the GI bleeding events

Assessment report

that occurred during or closer to the study drug dosing period (i.e., with onset on or before Day 13), 2 
of the 11 “early” GI bleeding events (18%) for fidaxomicin subjects were associated with an SAE, 
compared with  6 of the 10 “early” GI bleeding events (60%) for vancomycin subjects. The two 
fidaxomicin subjects who had “early” GI bleeding associated with an SAE both had undergone recent 
bowel resection prior to study enrolment, were on concomitant medications that could contribute to GI 
bleeding and only received a few doses of study drug. 
In addition, despite fidaxomicin has a low absorption level, systemic AEs considered as drug-related 
were reported (e.g. hallucinations (with positive dechallenge), transaminases increase).  
Nevertheless, no specific pattern and major safety concerns arose from these SAEs.

Cardiac safety 
There were no clinically significant changes in any vital signs parameters in either of the clinical 
studies. Preclinical studies on fidaxomicin do not indicate any signals on cardiac safety. Human clinical 
data on cardiac safety should preferably be based on a thorough QT study in healthy volunteers 
exposed for high doses of the study drug. Small differences in QTc time will be difficult to detect in 
patients due to underlying factors that may affect ECG parameters. Since fidaxomicin is poorly 
absorbed it was not considered feasible to expose healthy volunteers to supra-therapeutic levels 
needed for such a study. This is considered acceptable considering the lack of preclinical signals on 
cardiac safety.  
In the phase IIA study, a trend might be suspected for increase in QT interval (uncorrected and 
corrected) with a dose-relationship. Mean change in QTcF for the 400 mg/day-group was 6.7 ± 20.32 
ms. In addition, 2 patients (including one with a pacemaker for sick sinus syndrome) presented 
changes in QTcF ≥ 30 ms or ≥ 60 ms (1 each). The low number of patients in each treatment-group in 
this phase II study should be kept in mind and precludes any definite conclusions about effects of FID 
on QT-interval.  
In phase III studies, the number of cases of changes of QTc (Bazett’s or Fredericia’s) and cases of QTc 
> 450 ms reported with FID were not statistically different from those reported with VAN. The 
applicant stated that an ad hoc analysis was performed in study 101.1.C.004 according to plasma 
levels of FID and its main metabolite but no details were provided in the submitted dossier. In 
response to the D120, the applicant further substantiated this issue. Overall, non-clinical studies did 
not show any major effect of FID and its main metabolite on QT-interval. Phase 2 study involved a 
limited number of patients and provided poorly suggestive and informative data. Phase 3 studies did 
not allow firm conclusions about the risk of inducing QT-interval prolongation of FID or its main 
metabolite.  
The applicant did not perform any specific QTc study since he considers that very low plasma levels 
seen after FID dosing in healthy subjects makes such a study not feasible, making the necessary 
supratherapeutic exposure not achievable in volunteers. 
Taking account of the poorly suggestive data on QT interval prolongation, no such study appears 
warranted.  However, this issue is worth being closely monitored during postmarketing experience.

An additional subgroup analysis of patients with high plasma levels (fidaxomicin + OP-1118 ≥ 150 
ng/ml) using pooled data from studies 03 and 04 showed no association between QTc prolongation and 
plasma levels of fidaxomicin or its major metabolite. Thus, no correlation between plasma levels of 
fidaxomicin or its main metabolite and QT-prolongation could be demonstrated. 
Figure 5: 
Figure 6: 
From the data available, fidaxomicin and its main metabolite at concentrations up to10 µg/ml did not 
inhibit the hERG current and fidaxomicin had no pharmacologically relevant effect on QT interval, heart 
rate, blood pressure, PR interval, RR interval, QRS complex in conscious dogs. Thus, QT-interval 
prolongation does not seem to be a major safety concern with fidaxomicin.

Laboratory findings 
There were no clinically significant abnormalities, and no consistent, drug-related changes in the serum 
chemistry, haematology, or urine analysis parameters throughout the study period in the phase 1 or 
phase 2 studies.  
In the phase 3 studies, mean values were calculated from pre-treatment and end-of treatment 
measurements. Small changes in clinical laboratory values from baseline to the end of therapy were 
noted for each treatment. Changes in the WBC count, neutrophils, and electrolytes are consistent with 
resolving CDI. 
Although the number of cases reported remained too low to draw definite conclusions, a trend 
appeared in both phase III studies for the FID-group for a higher incidence of low neutrophils count, 
low lymphocytes count, low WBC (some of them also reported as SAEs) and high ASAT/ALAT.  The 
sponsor provided an extended safety analysis of all cases of markedly or clinically significant decreases 
in WBC, neutrophils or lymphocytes. Adverse events associated with a decrease in white blood cell 
(WBC) count parameter were more prevalent in the fidaxomicin arm (23 subjects in the fidaxomicin 
group versus 11 in the vancomycin group). Markedly abnormal low (worsened by two or more grades 
from the baseline toxicity grade) haematology values occurred at a higher incidence in the fidaxomicin 
group than the vancomycin group: lymphocytes (3.9% vs. 2.1%), leukocytes (1.6% vs. 0.8%), and 
neutrophils (1.4% vs. 0.2%). Nearly all of these shifts occurred in subjects with underlying 
haematological malignancies, recent bone marrow transplantation, and/or ongoing chemotherapy.  The 
fidaxomicin arm had a higher incidence of pre-existing active blood and lymphatic disorders at 
enrolment compared to vancomycin subjects (38.7% versus 32.6%).  The fidaxomicin arm also had a 
markedly higher prevalence of subjects concomitantly receiving treatment in the medication class of 
antineoplastic or immunomodulatory agents (67 subjects [11.9%] in the fidaxomicin group versus 48 
subjects [8.2%] in the vancomycin group). None of the cases with a serious or markedly abnormal 
reduction in a WBC parameter in fidaxomicin treated patients were considered as related to the test 
drug by the investigator. Although it is acknowledged that the reduction in WBC was partly attributed 
to imbalances in underlying conditions, there was a consistent but small imbalance between treatment 
groups at fidaxomicin’s disadvantage. Adverse events concerning decrease in white blood cell (WBC) 
count should be closely monitored and cumulatively reported in future PSURs. 
The applicant provided a detailed analysis on cases with markedly or clinically significant changes in 
LFTs. The incidence of AEs involving liver function tests (LFTs; AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and 
bilirubin) were similar between groups, 17 (3%) of the subjects in the fidaxomicin group and 14 
(2.4%) subjects in the vancomycin group had investigations AE related to LFTs.  The number of 
subjects with normal LFTs at baseline but a later LFT at least 3x the upper limit of normal (ULN) was 6 
for fidaxomicin and 5 for vancomycin.  No subjects in either group met Hy’s Law. Five subjects in each 
group had a reported SAE involving abnormal LFTs.  Narratives for these events were submitted, the 
majority were associated with underlying or concomitant conditions and the LFTs were basically 
recovered at the end of the investigation period. Due to the limited clinical experience of this novel 
drug, liver function adverse events shall be closely monitored and cumulatively reported in future 
PSURs.

Safety in special populations 
No analysis of safety data by intrinsic or extrinsic factors was carried out. However, although 
pharmacokinetics did not appear to be influenced by age, gender and race, and even if the number of 
patients was low for some subpopulations, it would be relevant to perform a safety analysis by intrinsic 
factors. According to the applicant, 12 patients with hepatic impairment were enrolled in phase III 
studies but no specific safety analysis has been provided. Although the number of patients with hepatic 
or renal impairment will remain too limited to draw definite conclusions and PK parameters did not 
appear to be influenced by organ impairment, it would be relevant to perform a safety analysis by 
severity of renal/hepatic impairment. The applicant submitted such an analysis on CHMP request. 
Regarding renal insufficiency and hepatic insufficiency, the numbers of FID- and VAN-patients in each 
group are too limited to conclude on a safety profile in these populations (e.g. 63 and 73 for moderate 
renal insufficiency; 74 and 82 for severe renal insufficiency; 17 and 21 for hepatic insufficiency). 
These populations will have to be closely monitored during postmarketing experience (see RMP). 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No drug interaction studies or analyses in relevant patient population have been completed to date. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
No subjects receiving fidaxomicin discontinued participation in the phase 1 studies or phase 2A due to 
an AE. In the phase 3 studies, compliance to treatment was high for both fidaxomicin and vancomycin 
with approximately 91% of the overall prescribed doses administered in both treatment groups.

Discontinuation due to adverse events was low in both studies with no apparent difference between 
treatment groups (< 10% across treatment groups). The TEAEs leading to withdrawal were similar in 
the two studies, and between the two treatment groups in either study.

In addition, treatment-emergent AEs leading to dose reduction or temporary medication stoppage were 
reported in the pooled phase 3 studies by 8 patients in the vancomycin group (bradycardia, 
arteriovenous fistula thrombosis, nausea and vomiting, anaemia, upper abdominal pain, pyrexia, panic 
attack, acute respiratory failure and hypotension) and two patients in the fidaxomicin group (nausea 
and vomiting).  
Post marketing experience 
There was no post-marketing experience for fidaxomicin at time of Marketing Authorisation application. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The current safety data-base consists of a total of 660 patients with mild to moderately severe C. 
difficile associated disease treated up to 10 days with fidaxomicin which may be considered acceptable 
for single treatment episodes of the study drug. The clinical studies included a large number of elderly 
patients and a relatively large number of patients with severe disease according to ECMID criteria. 
Patients with fulminant colitis and patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (ulcerative colitis and 
Crohn’s disease), were excluded from the study.  
Dificlir 
Assessment report  
Page 73/83
 
 
 
 
The clinical studies indicate that both fidaxomicin and vancomycin was well tolerated by the patients, 
which is in line with the low systemic exposure of these drugs when administered orally. The most 
frequent drug-related TEAEs in the pooled analysis were nausea, hypokalaemia, headache, vomiting 
and abdominal pain. The safety profile in general and considering drug-related events was very similar 
between the treatment groups and between studies.  
Adverse events associated with a decrease in white blood cell (WBC) count parameter were more 
prevalent in the fidaxomicin arm (23 subjects in the fidaxomicin group versus 11 in the vancomycin 
group). When analysing underlying haematological malignancies, recent bone marrow transplantation, 
and/or ongoing chemotherapy it was revealed that the difference between the treatment groups can be 
at least partially explained by underlying comorbidities and by the underlying differences in the 
proportion of subjects receiving chemotherapeutic agents.   
A higher number of patients in the fidaxomicin groups presented with increased transaminases, mainly 
driven by study 04. A shift from normal values at baseline to high values at a later time point for ALT 
and AST were seen in approximately 10% of subjects, and was similar in the fidaxomicin and 
vancomycin groups.  Approximately 5% of subjects in each group had a shift from normal to high 
alkaline phosphatise.  The number of subjects with normal LFTs at baseline but a later LFT at least 3x 
the upper limit of normal (ULN) was 6 for fidaxomicin and 5 for vancomycin.  There did not appear to 
be a correlation with plasma concentrations of fidaxomicin.  
Due to the limited clinical experience of this novel drug, close monitoring of laboratory parameter 
events including haematological and hepatic data should be performed with cumulative reporting in 
future PSURs. 
Safety assessment in acutely-ill patients with severe diarrhoea and a significant degree of co-morbidity 
is complex and complicated by the fact that the disease itself can induce reactions such as electrolyte 
disturbances, nausea, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding and other symptoms. Serious events 
including death were reported in the phase 3 studies. However these appear to be consistent with the 
clinical condition of individual patients and were reported by a similar rate in the two treatment arms. 
The highest frequency of serious adverse events (SAEs) was reported in the SOC Infections and 
Infestations. The most frequent preferred terms in the pooled analysis were pneumonia, Clostridium 
difficile colitis, sepsis and respiratory failure. The SAEs neutropenia, blood uric acid increased, 
hypophosphataemia and gastrointestinal haemorrhage occurred more commonly in the fidaxomicin 
group, irrespective of relatedness of the study drug.  Regarding elevated uric acid levels, an imbalance 
of underlying conditions (history of gout, hyperuricaemia and/or other serum chemistry abnormities) 
seem to explain the differences between treatment groups. Fidaxomicin exposure per se, i.e. serum 
levels of the parent compound or the metabolite, does not seem to have an impact on serum uric acid 
levels.  
All but one of hypophosphataemia reports was demonstrated to be attributable to subject’s underlying 
co-morbidity, such as impaired renal function. There was no clear correlation with CDI severity. 
However, as a precautionary measure, due to the limited clinical experience of this novel drug, the 
adverse events blood uric acid increased, hypophosphataemia should be closely monitored with 
cumulative reporting in future PSURs. 
Gastrointestinal bleeding is of specific concern for a drug aimed at treating severe diarrhoea. The 
extended analysis demonstrated that the incidence of all GI bleeding events was comparable between 
treatment groups 4.1% vs. 3.1%, respectively. Amongst the GI bleeding events that occurred during 
or closer to the study drug dosing period (i.e., with onset on or before Day 13), 2 of the 11 “early” GI 
bleeding events (18%) for fidaxomicin subjects were associated with an SAE, compared with  6 of the 
10 “early” GI bleeding events (60%) for vancomycin subjects. Narratives of each GI bleeding event did 
not raise any increased concerns regarding the role of fidaxomicin as a cause to gastrointestinal 
Dificlir 
Assessment report  
Page 74/83
 
 
 
haemorrhage. Although the current data do not indicate any enhanced risk for fidaxomicin to cause GI 
bleeding, a close monitoring of these advert events  with cumulative reports in future PSURs is 
recommended due to the limited clinical data presently available for this new class of drugs. 
There were no clinically significant changes in any vital sign criteria in either of the clinical studies and 
no significant difference between the treatment groups. No QT study in healthy volunteers was 
preformed due to the limited absorption of the drug which is considered acceptable considering the 
lack of preclinical signals on cardiac safety. No clinical significant changes from baseline to EOT in 
mean ECG parameters were seen in patients participating in the phase 3 studies and no evidence of 
QTc prolongation by fidaxomicin was identified. However, due to a trend from phase IIA, this issue will 
have to be monitored in post marketing. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events was low in both phase 3 studies with no apparent difference 
between treatment groups. 
Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases were excluded from the studies. As absorption from the 
gastro-intestinal tract may be increased in these patients, the safety profile may be different in this 
patient population. This is addressed as important missing information in the RMP and the Applicant 
should perform close post-marketing surveillance and report cumulatively in future PSURs, in order to 
generate safety data in this patient group. 
Clostridium difficile associated diarrhoea is associated with a high incidence of recurrences. It is 
reported that up to a third of patients experience recurrences after successful treatment with 
metronidazole or vancomycin. Some patients suffer of repeated treatment failures and frequent 
recurrences leading to a substantial impact on the quality of life. The Applicant has committed to 
perform a post-authorisation clinical study to investigate the safety and efficacy of repeated use of 
fidaxomicin, in patients subjected to repeated treatment with fidaxomicin.  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics.

2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The available safety data, mainly based on two pivotal studies, indicate that fidaxomicin is well 
tolerated with a safety profile similar with that of vancomycin when used in the treatment of C. difficile 
infection. Fidaxomicin is a new drug with no previous clinical experience to support the safety profile. 
However, the available non-clinical and clinical safety data indicate that the benefit-risk balance in the 
applied indication may be considered to be positive.  
A post-authorisation clinical study to investigate the safety (and efficacy) of repeated use of 
fidaxomicin and a post marketing drug utilization study to further assess the use of fidaxomicin in 
standard clinical practice have been planned (RMP measures).

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Fidaxomicin represents a novel class of antibacterials, the 18-membered macrocyclic antibacterial 
drugs. Due to its unique mechanism of action which is distinct from that of any other class of 
antimicrobials the potential of cross-resistance to other antibiotic classes is anticipated to be low. The 
relatively low absorption of fidaxomicin ensures that a high concentration in the entire intestinal tract 
is maintained after oral administration. Its concentrations in the stool largely exceed the MIC of 
C difficile (up to 5 000 x MIC90 for C. difficile). In combination with the narrow spectrum of fidaxomicin 
and its main metabolite directed primarily against Clostridium species, an in vitro demonstrated anti-
spore activity and the significant post-antibiotic effect, these features are beneficial characteristics for 
a drug in the applied indication CDI. 
The non-inferiority of fidaxomicin compared to orally administrated vancomycin was demonstrated in 
two randomized double-blind controlled phase 3 studies in patients with mild to moderately severe C. 
difficile infection. The primary efficacy variable was clinical cure at end of therapy which was achieved 
for 92% in the fidaxomicin group and in 90% in the vancomycin group, in the PP population 
(Difference 1.7; 95% CI -1.7 – 5.3). Superiority was shown for secondary endpoints, recurrence rate 
(14% vs. 26%) and global cure rate (76% vs. 64%) for fidaxomicin and vancomycin, respectively 
(mITT-population), within 30 days after discontinuation of treatment. These results are considered 
highly clinically relevant, since recurrence of CDI is an acknowledged challenge with currently available 
treatments. The reduction in recurrences compared to vancomycin was mainly attributed to fewer 
recurrences the first two weeks after EOT, thus fidaxomicin appears to be associated with lower rate of 
relapses (likely with the same strain) while late recurrences (likely re-infection with a new strain) were 
equally common in both treatment groups. The recurrence rates within 30 days post-treatment were 
consistently significantly higher in the vancomycin groups compared to the fidaxomicin groups in both 
the PP and mITT populations. Subgroup analyses indicated consistent numerical superior outcome for 
fidaxomicin treated patients also in subgroups generally associated with inferior cure rates, including 
severe disease (as judged by the investigator or using ESCMID criteria), high age, prior episode of 
CDI, concomitant systemic antibiotic and inpatient status. Also global cure rates were consistently 
more favourable for the fidaxomicin treated patients. Global cure is considered a crucial endpoint since 
this endpoint may be considered most meaningful for the patient, taking the high recurrence rates 
Dificlir 
Assessment report  
Page 79/83
 
 
 
 
 
after current available therapeutic options into account (20 to 30% recurrence rates have been 
reported after initial successful treatment with vancomycin or metronidazole).  
The studied patient population seems to be generally representative for the target population, 
including a high number of elderly patients with almost 50% of patients ≥ 65 years and approximately 
65% being hospitalised and a sufficient number of patients infected with the hypervirulent BI/027 
strain (approximately 25%). While study 03 only enrolled patients from North America approximately 
40% of patients included in study 04 were from European sites. Gender or ethnicity did not have an 
impact on the clinical response. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
More than 70% of included patients were considered by the investigators to have moderate to severe 
infection, but there is a lack of validated severity scoring index systems. Patients were generally 
comparable between treatment groups for reported baseline characteristics. However, data from 
several important subgroups of patients, such as patients with pseudomembranous colitis, patients 
with multiple recurrences of CDI, patients with IBD and patients with impaired renal and impaired 
hepatic function, are missing, which is addressed in the SmPC and in the RMP.  
Patients with multiple occurrences of CDI (defined as more than 1 prior occurrence within the past 3 
months) were excluded from the studies. This group of patients currently constitutes a real clinical 
challenge and there is an urgent need for improved treatment alternatives leading to sustained cure. 
In addition, no data on repeated treatment with fidaxomicin have been presented. The Applicant has 
committed to perform a post-authorisation study in patients receiving repeated treatment with 
fidaxomicin, which is addressed in the RMP. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Fidaxomicin is an NCE and the first representative in this novel antibacterial class of macrocycles, thus 
no clinical experience of this or similar drugs is available. The current safety data-base may be 
considered very small and consists of a total of 660 patients with mild to moderately severe C. difficile 
associated diarrhoea treated up to 10 days with fidaxomicin. 
The clinical studies indicate that fidaxomicin is well tolerated and has a safety profile in line with that of 
orally administered vancomycin. The most frequent drug-related TEAEs in the pooled analysis were 
nausea, hypokalaemia, headache, vomiting and abdominal pain. The safety profile in general and 
considering drug-related events was very similar between the treatment groups and between studies.  
Serious events including death were reported in both phase 3 studies, however these appear to be 
consistent with the clinical condition of individual patients and were reported by a similar rate in the 
two treatment arms. The highest frequency of serious adverse events (SAEs) was reported in the SOC 
Infections and Infestations. The most frequent preferred terms in the pooled analysis were pneumonia, 
C. difficile colitis, sepsis and respiratory failure. The SAEs neutropenia, blood uric acid increased, 
hypophosphataemia and gastrointestinal haemorrhage occurred more commonly in the fidaxomicin 
group. Although confounding factors such as underlying conditions and concomitant medications 
seemed to at least partly contribute to these imbalances between treatment groups, these adverse 
events should be closely monitored and cumulatively reported in future PSURs.  
There was an imbalance in significant changes in liver function tests parameters between treatment 
groups, with higher number of patients in the fidaxomicin groups presenting increased transaminases, 
mainly driven by study 04. The majority were associated with underlying or concomitant conditions 
Dificlir 
Assessment report  
Page 80/83
 
 
 
and the LFTs were basically recovered at the end of the investigation period. Five subjects in each 
group had a reported SAE involving abnormal LFTs. There did not appear to be a correlation with 
plasma concentrations of fidaxomicin. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Safety assessment in acutely-ill patients with severe diarrhoea and a significant degree of co-morbidity 
is complex and complicated by the fact that the disease itself can induce reactions such as electrolyte 
disturbances, nausea, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding and other symptoms.  
Patients with fulminant colitis and patients with inflammatory bowel diseases were excluded from the 
studies. As absorption from the gastrointestinal tract may be increased in these patients, the safety 
profile may be different in these patient populations, which is addressed in the RMP as well as in the 
Product Information. Exposure is also increased in patients with hepatic impairment and in patients 
with co-administration of P-gp inhibitors. Caution should be advised in patients with moderate to 
severe hepatic impairment and co-administration of potent P-gp inhibitors should be avoided. 
In addition the present uncertainty regarding plasma levels in CDI patients have implications for the 
evaluation of exposure margins. 
Fidaxomicin is a new chemical entity without previous experience in clinical practice and although 
absorption may be considered relatively low, it cannot be ruled out that levels of systemic exposure 
may lead to potential safety effects, especially in patients with damaged intestinal mucosa, such as 
patients with severe CDI and patients with inflammatory intestinal diseases. The presented safety data 
base is considered very small for an NCE and safety data are currently missing in patients subjected to 
repeated use of fidaxomicin.  Also potential emergence of resistance in the clinical setting is unknown 
which is addressed in the RMP and in the SmPC. Information on repeated use of fidaxomicin is missing 
which is addressed in the RMP. The applicant has committed to perform a post-approval study in 
patients receiving repeated use of fidaxomicin as well as performing a post marketing non-
interventional study to further assess the use of fidaxomicin in standard clinical practice. Due to the 
limited clinical experience of this novel drug, monitoring of adverse events concerning laboratory 
parameters including haematological and hepatic data should be performed with cumulative reporting 
in future PSURs. 
Benefit Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The fact that fidaxomicin belongs to a novel antibiotic class is considered important from an antibiotic 
resistance perspective, limiting the risks for cross-resistance.  A limited disruption on the normal 
intestinal flora as well as activity against C. difficile spores is considered valuable, since it may 
contribute to lesser frequency of recurrences. The non-inferiority to vancomycin in clinical cure rates 
and in particular the superiority in global cure rates, in particular concerning relapses, is very 
promising, considering the major negative consequences of repeated recurrences, both for the society 
and for the individual subject. 
Data from the current studies indicate that fidaxomicin is well tolerated with a safety profile in line with 
vancomycin. However, there are several uncertainties remaining, related to potentially increased 
systemic exposure in patients with impaired hepatic function and in patients with increased absorption 
of the drug (either due to damage intestinal mucosa or during co-administration of P-gp inhibitors), as 
well to lack of data in important groups of patients. These uncertainties are stated in the Product 
information and adequately addressed in the RMP.

Assessment report

Benefit-risk balance 
The severity of the disease and the medical need for new agents to treat CDI should be considered 
along with the unknown risks of this novel drug especially related to seriously ill patients with severely 
damaged intestinal mucosa. At the present stage, the benefit – risk relationship for fidaxomicin in the 
treatment of CDI is considered to be favourable. 
Discussion on the Benefit Risk Balance 
The benefit-risk for fidaxomicin should be weighed to that of currently available treatment options for 
CDI, vancomycin and metronidazole. Both these drugs are hampered by several drawbacks. CDI is a 
significant and increasing medical problem, and an effective and safe treatment alternative is urgently 
needed.  The current data base for fidaxomicin may be considered sufficiently demonstrating the 
benefits of fidaxomicin in the sought indication, provided that adequate post-marketing activities, as 
guided in the RMP, are adhered to.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Dificlir indicated in adults for the treatment of Clostridium difficile 
infections (CDI) also known as C. difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD) (see section 5.1) is favourable 
and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription. 
Conditions and requirements of the Marketing Authorisation  
Risk Management System and PSUR cycle 
The MAH must ensure that the system of pharmacovigilance, presented in Module 1.8.1 of the 
marketing authorisation, is in place and functioning before and whilst the product is on the market.

Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Trisenox 
arsenic trioxide 
On 13 October 2016, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
Trisenox. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Teva B.V. 
The CHMP adopted changes to the existing indication as follows2: 
‘‘Trisenox is indicated for induction of remission, and consolidation in adult patients with relapsed: 
•  Newly diagnosed low-to-intermediate risk acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) (white 
blood cell count, ≤ 10 x 103/µl) in combination with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) 
•  Relapsed/refractory acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) (previous treatment should have 
included a retinoid and chemotherapy) 
characterised by the presence of the t(15;17) translocation and/or the presence of the Pro-Myelocytic 
Leukaemia/Retinoic-Acid-Receptor-alpha (PML/RAR-alpha) gene. Previous treatment should have 
included a retinoid and chemotherapy. 
The response rate of other acute myelogenous leukaemia subtypes to Trisenox arsenic trioxide has 
not been examined.’’ 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of 
product characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to 
the marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission.

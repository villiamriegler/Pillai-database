CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) 
Votrient is indicated in adults for the first-line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and 
for patients who have received prior cytokine therapy for advanced disease. 
Soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) 
Votrient is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with selective subtypes of advanced soft-tissue 
sarcoma (STS) who have received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease or who have progressed 
within 12 months after (neo) adjuvant therapy. 
Efficacy and safety has only been established in certain STS histological tumour subtypes (see 
section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Votrient treatment should only be initiated by a physician experienced in the administration of 
anti-cancer medicinal products.

Posology 
Adults 
The recommended dose of pazopanib for the treatment of RCC or STS is 800 mg once daily. 
Dose modifications 
Dose modification (decrease or increase) should be in 200 mg decrements or increments in a stepwise 
fashion based on individual tolerability in order to manage adverse reactions. The dose of pazopanib 
should not exceed 800 mg. 
Paediatric population 
Pazopanib should not be used in children younger than 2 years of age because of safety concerns with 
regard to organ growth and maturation (see sections 4.4 and 5.3). 
The safety and efficacy of pazopanib in children aged 2 to 18 years of age have not yet been 
established. 
Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology 
can be made. 
Elderly 
There are limited data on the use of pazopanib in patients aged 65 years and older. In the RCC studies 
of pazopanib, overall no clinically significant differences in safety of pazopanib were observed 
between subjects aged at least 65 years and younger subjects. Clinical experience has not identified 
differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some 
elderly patients cannot be ruled out. 
Renal impairment 
Renal impairment is unlikely to have a clinically relevant effect on pazopanib pharmacokinetics given 
the low renal excretion of pazopanib and metabolites (see section 5.2). Therefore, no dose adjustment 
is required in patients with creatinine clearance above 30 ml/min. Caution is advised in patients with 
creatinine clearance below 30 ml/min as there is no experience of pazopanib in this patient population. 
Hepatic impairment 
Dosing recommendations in hepatically impaired patients are based on pharmacokinetic studies of 
pazopanib in patients with varying degrees of hepatic dysfunction (see section 5.2). All patients should 
have liver function tests to determine whether they have hepatic impairment before starting and during 
pazopanib therapy (see section 4.4). Administration of pazopanib to patients with mild or moderate 
hepatic impairment should be undertaken with caution and close monitoring of tolerability. 800 mg 
pazopanib once daily is the recommended dose in patients with mild abnormalities in serum liver tests 
(defined either as normal bilirubin and any degree of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation or as 
an elevation of bilirubin (>35% direct) up to 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) regardless of the ALT 
value). A reduced pazopanib dose of 200 mg once daily is recommended in patients with moderate 
hepatic impairment (defined as an elevation of bilirubin >1.5 to 3 x ULN regardless of the ALT value) 
(see section 5.2). 
Pazopanib is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (defined as total bilirubin 
>3 x ULN regardless of the ALT value). 
See section 4.4 for liver monitoring and dose modification for patients with drug-induced 
hepatotoxicity. 
Method of administration 
Pazopanib is for oral use. It should be taken without food, at least one hour before or two hours after a 
meal (see section 5.2). The film-coated tablets should be taken whole with water and not broken or 
crushed (see section 5.2).

4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Hepatic effects 
Cases of hepatic failure (including fatalities) have been reported during use of pazopanib. 
Administration of pazopanib to patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment should be 
undertaken with caution and close monitoring. 800 mg pazopanib once daily is the recommended dose 
in patients with mild abnormalities in serum liver tests (either normal bilirubin and any degree of ALT 
elevation or elevation of bilirubin up to 1.5 x ULN regardless of the ALT value). A reduced pazopanib 
dose of 200 mg once daily is recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (elevation of 
bilirubin >1.5 to 3 x ULN regardless of the ALT value) (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). Pazopanib is not 
recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >3 x ULN regardless of the 
ALT value) (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). Exposure at a 200 mg dose is markedly reduced, though highly 
variable, in these patients, with values considered insufficient to obtain a clinically relevant effect. 
In clinical studies with pazopanib, increase in serum transaminases (ALT, aspartate aminotransferase 
[AST]) and bilirubin were observed (see section 4.8). In the majority of the cases, isolated increases in 
ALT and AST have been reported, without concomitant elevations of alkaline phosphatase or 
bilirubin. Patients over 60 years of age may be at greater risk for mild (>3 x ULN) to severe 
(>8 x ULN) elevation of ALT. Patients who carry the HLA-B*57:01 allele have an increased risk of 
pazopanib-associated ALT elevations. Liver function should be monitored in all subjects receiving 
pazopanib, regardless of genotype or age (see section 5.1). 
Serum liver tests should be performed before initiation of treatment with pazopanib, at weeks 3, 5, 7 
and 9, then at months 3 and 4, with additional tests as clinically indicated. Periodic testing should then 
continue after month 4. 
See Table 1 for dose modification guidance for patients with baseline values of total bilirubin 
1.5 x ULN and AST and ALT 2 x ULN:

Dose modification 
Continue on pazopanib with weekly monitoring of liver function 
until transaminases return to Grade 1 or baseline. 
Interrupt pazopanib until transaminases return to Grade 1 or 
baseline. 
If the potential benefit of reinitiating pazopanib treatment is 
considered to outweigh the risk for hepatotoxicity, then 
reintroduce pazopanib at a reduced dose of 400 mg daily and 
perform serum liver tests weekly for 8 weeks. Following 
reintroduction of pazopanib, if transaminase elevations >3 x ULN 
recur, then pazopanib should be permanently discontinued. 
Permanently discontinue pazopanib. 
Patients should be monitored until return to Grade 1 or baseline. 
Pazopanib is a UGT1A1 inhibitor. Mild, indirect (unconjugated) 
hyperbilirubinaemia may occur in patients with Gilbert’s 
syndrome. Patients with only a mild indirect hyperbilirubinaemia, 
known or suspected Gilbert’s syndrome, and elevation in ALT 
>3 x ULN should be managed as per the recommendations 
outlined for isolated ALT elevations. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Concomitant use of pazopanib and simvastatin increases the risk of ALT elevations (see section 4.5) 
and should be undertaken with caution and close monitoring. 
Hypertension 
In clinical studies with pazopanib, events of hypertension including newly diagnosed symptomatic 
episodes of elevated blood pressure (hypertensive crisis) have occurred. Blood pressure should be well 
controlled prior to initiating pazopanib. Patients should be monitored for hypertension early after 
starting treatment (no longer than one week after starting pazopanib) and frequently thereafter to 
ensure blood pressure control. Elevated blood pressure levels (systolic blood pressure ≥150 mm Hg or 
diastolic blood pressure ≥100 mm Hg) occurred early in the course of treatment (approximately 40% 
of cases occurred by day 9 and approximately 90% of cases occurred in the first 18 weeks). Blood 
pressure should be monitored and managed promptly using a combination of anti-hypertensive therapy 
and dose modification of pazopanib (interruption and re-initiation at a reduced dose based on clinical 
judgement) (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Pazopanib should be discontinued if there is evidence of 
hypertensive crisis or if hypertension is severe and persists despite anti-hypertensive therapy and 
pazopanib dose reduction. 
Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)/Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy 
syndrome (RPLS) 
PRES/RPLS has been reported in association with pazopanib. PRES/RPLS can present with headache, 
hypertension, seizure, lethargy, confusion, blindness and other visual and neurological disturbances, 
and can be fatal. Patients developing PRES/RPLS should permanently discontinue treatment with 
pazopanib. 
Interstitial lung disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis 
ILD, which can be fatal, has been reported in association with pazopanib (see section 4.8). Patients 
should be monitored for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis and pazopanib should be 
discontinued in patients developing ILD or pneumonitis. 
Cardiac dysfunction/Heart failure 
The risks and benefits of pazopanib should be considered before beginning therapy in patients who 
have pre-existing cardiac dysfunction. The safety and pharmacokinetics of pazopanib in patients with 
moderate to severe heart failure or those with a below normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 
have not been studied. 
In clinical studies with pazopanib, events of cardiac dysfunction such as congestive heart failure and 
decreased LVEF have occurred (see section 4.8). In a randomised study comparing pazopanib and 
sunitinib in RCC (VEG108844), subjects had baseline and follow up LVEF measurements. 
Myocardial dysfunction occurred in 13% (47/362) of subjects in the pazopanib arm compared to 11% 
(42/369) of subjects in the sunitinib arm. Congestive heart failure was observed in 0.5% of subjects in 
each treatment arm. Congestive heart failure was reported in 3 out of 240 subjects (1%) in the Phase 
III VEG110727 STS study. Decreases in LVEF in subjects who had post-baseline and follow-up 
LVEF measurement were detected in 11% (15/140) in the pazopanib arm, compared with 3% (1/39) in 
the placebo arm. 
Risk factors 
Thirteen of the 15 subjects in the pazopanib arm of the STS Phase III study had concurrent 
hypertension which may have exacerbated cardiac dysfunction in patients at risk by increasing cardiac 
after-load. 99% of patients (243/246) enrolled in the STS Phase III study, including the 15 subjects, 
received anthracycline. Prior anthracycline therapy may be a risk factor for cardiac dysfunction. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Outcome 
Four of the 15 subjects had full recovery (within 5% of baseline) and 5 had partial recovery (within the 
normal range, but >5% below baseline). One subject did not recover and follow-up data were not 
available for the other 5 subjects. 
Management 
Interruption of pazopanib and/or dose reduction should be combined with treatment of hypertension (if 
present, refer to hypertension warning section above) in patients with significant reductions in LVEF, 
as clinically indicated. 
Patients should be carefully monitored for clinical signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure. 
Baseline and periodic evaluation of LVEF is recommended in patients at risk of cardiac dysfunction. 
QT prolongation and torsade de pointes 
In clinical studies with pazopanib, events of QT prolongation and torsade de pointes have occurred 
(see section 4.8). Pazopanib should be used with caution in patients with a history of QT interval 
prolongation, in patients taking antiarrhythmics or other medicinal products that may prolong QT 
interval and in patients with relevant pre-existing cardiac disease. When using pazopanib, baseline and 
periodic monitoring of electrocardiograms and maintenance of electrolytes (e.g. calcium, magnesium, 
potassium) within normal range is recommended. 
Arterial thrombotic events 
In clinical studies with pazopanib, myocardial infarction, myocardial ischaemia, ischaemic stroke and 
transient ischaemic attack were observed (see section 4.8). Fatal events have been observed. 
Pazopanib should be used with caution in patients who are at increased risk of thrombotic events or 
who have had a history of thrombotic events. Pazopanib has not been studied in patients who have had 
an event within the previous 6 months. A treatment decision should be made based on the assessment 
of individual patient’s benefit/risk. 
Venous thromboembolic events 
In clinical studies with pazopanib, venous thromboembolic events including venous thrombosis and 
fatal pulmonary embolus have occurred. While observed in both RCC and STS studies, the incidence 
was higher in the STS population (5%) than in the RCC population (2%). 
Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) 
TMA has been reported in clinical studies of pazopanib as monotherapy, in combination with 
bevacizumab, and in combination with topotecan (see section 4.8). Patients developing TMA should 
permanently discontinue treatment with pazopanib. Reversal of effects of TMA has been observed 
after treatment was discontinued. Pazopanib is not indicated for use in combination with other agents. 
Haemorrhagic events 
In clinical studies with pazopanib haemorrhagic events have been reported (see section 4.8). Fatal 
haemorragic events have occurred. Pazopanib has not been studied in patients who had a history of 
haemoptysis, cerebral haemorrhage or clinically significant gastrointestinal (GI) haemorrhage in the 
past 6 months. Pazopanib should be used with caution in patients with significant risk of haemorrhage. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Aneurysms and artery dissections 
The use of VEGF pathway inhibitors in patients with or without hypertension may promote the 
formation of aneurysms and/or artery dissections. Before initiating pazopanib, this risk should be 
carefully considered in patients with risk factors such as hypertension or history of aneurysms. 
Gastrointestinal (GI) perforations and fistula 
In clinical studies with pazopanib, events of GI perforation or fistula have occurred (see section 4.8). 
Fatal perforation events have occurred. Pazopanib should be used with caution in patients at risk for 
GI perforation or fistula. 
Wound healing 
No formal studies of the effect of pazopanib on wound healing have been conducted. Since vascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors may impair wound healing, treatment with pazopanib 
should be stopped at least 7 days prior to scheduled surgery. The decision to resume pazopanib after 
surgery should be based on clinical judgement of adequate wound healing. Pazopanib should be 
discontinued in patients with wound dehiscence. 
Hypothyroidism 
In clinical studies with pazopanib, events of hypothyroidism have occurred (see section 4.8). Baseline 
laboratory measurement of thyroid function is recommended and patients with hypothyroidism should 
be treated as per standard medical practice prior to the start of pazopanib treatment. All patients should 
be observed closely for signs and symptoms of thyroid dysfunction on pazopanib treatment. 
Laboratory monitoring of thyroid function should be performed periodically and managed as per 
standard medical practice. 
Proteinuria 
In clinical studies with pazopanib, proteinuria has been reported. Baseline and periodic urinanalysis 
during treatment is recommended and patients should be monitored for worsening proteinuria. 
Pazopanib should be discontinued if the patient develops nephrotic syndrome. 
Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) 
The occurrence of TLS, including fatal TLS, has been associated with the use of pazopanib (see 
section 4.8). Patients at increased risk of TLS are those with rapidly growing tumours, a high tumour 
burden, renal dysfunction, or dehydration. Preventative measures, such as treatment of high uric acid 
levels and intravenous hydration, should be considered prior to initiation of Votrient. Patients at risk 
should be closely monitored and treated as clinically indicated. 
Pneumothorax 
In clinical studies with pazopanib in advanced soft tissue sarcoma, events of pneumothorax have 
occurred (see section 4.8). Patients on pazopanib treatment should be observed closely for signs and 
symptoms of pneumothorax. 
Paediatric population 
Because the mechanism of action of pazopanib can severely affect organ growth and maturation 
during early post-natal development in rodents (see section 5.3), pazopanib should not be given to 
paediatric patients younger than 2 years of age. 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Infections 
Cases of serious infections (with or without neutropenia), in some cases with fatal outcome, have been 
reported. 
Combination with other systemic anti-cancer therapies 
Clinical studies of pazopanib in combination with a number of other anti-cancer therapies (including 
for example pemetrexed, lapatinib or pembrolizumab) were terminated early due to concerns over 
increased toxicity and/or mortality, and a safe and effective combination dose has not been established 
with these regimens. 
Pregnancy 
Pre-clinical studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). If pazopanib is used 
during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant whilst receiving pazopanib, the potential hazard 
to the foetus should be explained to the patient. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to 
avoid becoming pregnant while receiving treatment with pazopanib (see section 4.6). 
Interactions 
Concomitant treatment with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) or breast cancer 
resistance protein (BCRP) should be avoided due to risk of increased exposure to pazopanib (see 
section 4.5). Selection of alternative concomitant medicinal products with no or minimal potential to 
inhibit CYP3A4, P-gp or BCRP should be considered. 
Concomitant treatment with inducers of CYP3A4 should be avoided due to risk of decreased exposure 
to pazopanib (see section 4.5). 
Cases of hyperglycaemia have been observed during concomitant treatment with ketoconazole. 
Concomitant administration of pazopanib with uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase 1A1 
(UGT1A1) substrates (e.g. irinotecan) should be undertaken with caution since pazopanib is an 
inhibitor of UGT1A1 (see section 4.5). 
Grapefruit juice should be avoided during treatment with pazopanib (see section 4.5). 
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per film-coated tablet, that is to say 
essentially ‘sodium-free’.

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Effects of other medicinal products on pazopanib 
In vitro studies suggested that the oxidative metabolism of pazopanib in human liver microsomes is 
mediated primarily by CYP3A4, with minor contributions from CYP1A2 and CYP2C8. Therefore, 
inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 may alter the metabolism of pazopanib. 
CYP3A4, P-gp, BCRP inhibitors 
Pazopanib is a substrate for CYP3A4, P-gp and BCRP. 
Concurrent administration of pazopanib (400 mg once daily) with the strong CYP3A4 and P-gp 
inhibitor ketoconazole (400 mg once daily) for 5 consecutive days resulted in a 66% and 45% increase 
in mean pazopanib AUC(0-24) and Cmax, respectively, relative to administration of pazopanib alone 
(400 mg once daily for 7 days). Pharmacokinetic parameter comparisons of pazopanib Cmax (range of 
means 27.5 to 58.1 µg/ml) and AUC(0-24) (range of means 48.7 to 1040 µg*h/ml) after administration 
of pazopanib 800 mg alone and after administration of pazopanib 400 mg plus ketoconazole 400 mg 
(mean Cmax 59.2 µg/ml, mean AUC(0-24)1300 µg*h/ml) indicated that, in the presence of a strong 
CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitor a dose reduction to pazopanib 400 mg once daily will, in the majority of 
patients, result in systemic exposure similar to that observed after administration of 800 mg pazopanib 
once daily alone. Some patients however may have systemic pazopanib exposure greater than what 
has been observed after administration of 800 mg pazopanib alone. 
Co-administration of pazopanib with other strong inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family (e.g. itraconazole, 
clarithromycin, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, 
voriconazole) may increase pazopanib concentrations. Grapefruit juice contains an inhibitor of 
CYP3A4 and may also increase plasma concentrations of pazopanib. 
Administration of 1500 mg lapatinib (a substrate for and weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 and P-gp and a 
potent inhibitor of BCRP) with 800 mg pazopanib resulted in an approximately 50% to 60% increase 
in mean pazopanib AUC(0-24) and Cmax compared to administration of 800 mg pazopanib alone. 
Inhibition of P-gp and/or BCRP by lapatinib likely contributed to the increased exposure to pazopanib. 
Co-administration of pazopanib with a CYP3A4, P-gp, and BCRP inhibitor, such as lapatinib, will 
result in an increase in plasma pazopanib concentrations. Co-administration with potent P-gp or BCRP 
inhibitors may also alter the exposure and distribution of pazopanib, including distribution into the 
central nervous systems (CNS). 
Concomitant use of pazopanib with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor should be avoided (see section 4.4). If 
no medically acceptable alternative to a strong CYP34A inhibitor is available, the dose of pazopanib 
should be reduced to 400 mg daily during concomitant administration. In such cases there should be 
close attention to adverse drug reaction, and further dose reduction may be considered if possible 
drug-related adverse events are observed. 
Combination with strong P-gp or BCRP inhibitors should be avoided, or selection of an alternate 
concomitant medicinal product with no or minimal potential to inhibit P-gp or BCRP is recommended. 
CYP3A4, P-gp, BCRP inducers 
CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampin may decrease plasma pazopanib concentrations. Co-administration 
of pazopanib with potent P-gp or BCRP inducers may alter the exposure and distribution of pazopanib, 
including distribution into the CNS. Selection of an alternative concomitant medication with no or 
minimal enzyme or transporter induction potential is recommended.

Effects of pazopanib on other medicinal products 
In vitro studies with human liver microsomes showed that pazopanib inhibited CYP enzymes 1A2, 
3A4, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, and 2E1. Potential induction of human CYP3A4 was demonstrated in an 
in vitro human PXR assay. Clinical pharmacology studies, using pazopanib 800 mg once daily, have 
demonstrated that pazopanib does not have a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of 
caffeine (CYP1A2 probe substrate), warfarin (CYP2C9 probe substrate), or omeprazole (CYP2C19 
probe substrate) in cancer patients. Pazopanib resulted in an increase of approximately 30% in the 
mean AUC and Cmax of midazolam (CYP3A4 probe substrate) and increases of 33% to 64% in the 
ratio of dextrometrophan to dextrophan concentrations in the urine after oral administration of 
dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 probe substrate). Co-administration of pazopanib 800 mg once daily and 
paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 (CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 substrate) once weekly resulted in a mean increase of 
26% and 31% in paclitaxel AUC and Cmax, respectively. 
Based on in vitro IC50 and in vivo plasma Cmax values, pazopanib metabolites GSK1268992 and 
GSK1268997 may contribute to the net inhibitory effect of pazopanib towards BCRP. Furthermore, 
inhibition of BCRP and P-gp by pazopanib in the gastrointestinal tract cannot be excluded. Care 
should be taken when pazopanib is co-administered with other oral BCRP and P-gp substrates. 
In vitro, pazopanib inhibited human organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP1B1). It cannot be 
excluded that pazopanib will affect the pharmacokinetics of substrates of OATP1B1 (e.g. statins, see 
“Effect of concomitant use of pazopanib and simvastatin” below). 
Pazopanib is an inhibitor of the uridine diphosphoglucuronosyl-transferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) enzyme in 
vitro. The active metabolite of irinotecan, SN-38, is a substrate for OATP1B1 and UGT1A1. 
Co-administration of pazopanib 400 mg once daily with cetuximab 250 mg/m2 and irinotecan 
150 mg/m2 resulted in an approximately 20% increase in systemic exposure to SN-38. Pazopanib may 
have a greater impact on SN-38 disposition in subjects with the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism relative to 
subjects with the wild-type allele. However, the UGT1A1 genotype was not always predictive of the 
effect of pazopanib on SN-38 disposition. Care should be taken when pazopanib is co-administered 
with substrates of UGT1A1. 
Effect of concomitant use of pazopanib and simvastatin 
Concomitant use of pazopanib and simvastatin increases the incidence of ALT elevations. Results 
from a meta-analysis using pooled data from clinical studies with pazopanib show that ALT >3x ULN 
was reported in 126/895 (14%) of patients who did not use statins, compared with 11/41 (27%) of 
patients who had concomitant use of simvastatin (p = 0.038). If a patient receiving concomitant 
simvastatin develops ALT elevations, follow guidelines for pazopanib posology and discontinue 
simvastatin (see section 4.4). In addition, concomitant use of pazopanib and other statins should be 
undertaken with caution as there are insufficient data available to assess their impact on ALT levels. It 
cannot be excluded that pazopanib will affect the pharmacokinetics of other statins (e.g. atorvastatin, 
fluvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin). 
Effect of food on pazopanib 
Administration of pazopanib with a high-fat or low-fat meal results in an approximately 2-fold 
increase in AUC and Cmax. Therefore, pazopanib should be administered at least 1 hour before or 
2 hours after a meal. 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Medicinal products that raise gastric pH 
Concomitant administration of pazopanib with esomeprazole decreases the bioavailability of 
pazopanib by approximately 40% (AUC and Cmax), and co-administration of pazopanib with medicines 
that increase gastric pH should be avoided. If the concomitant use of a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) is 
medically necessary, it is recommended that the dose of pazopanib be taken without food once daily in 
the evening concomitantly with the PPI. If the concomitant administration of an H2-receptor 
antagonist is medically necessary, pazopanib should be taken without food at least 2 hours before or at 
least 10 hours after a dose of an H2-receptor antagonist. Pazopanib should be administered at least 
1 hour before or 2 hours after administration of short-acting antacids. The recommendations for how 
PPIs and H2-receptor antagonists are co-administered are based on physiological considerations. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy/ Contraception in males and females 
There are no adequate data from the use of pazopanib in pregnant women. Studies in animals have 
shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. 
Pazopanib should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires 
treatment with pazopanib. If pazopanib is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant 
while receiving pazopanib, the potential hazard to the foetus should be explained to the patient. 
Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use adequate contraception during treatment 
and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose of pazopanib and to avoid becoming pregnant while 
receiving treatment with pazopanib. 
Male patients (including those who have had vasectomies) should use condoms during sexual 
intercourse while taking pazopanib and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose of pazopanib to avoid 
potential exposure to the medicinal product for pregnant partners and female partners of reproductive 
potential. 
Breast-feeding 
The safe use of pazopanib during breast-feeding has not been established. It is not known whether 
pazopanib or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. There are no animal data on the excretion of 
pazopanib in animal milk. A risk to the breast-fed child cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be 
discontinued during treatment with pazopanib.  
Fertility 
Animal studies indicate that male and female fertility may be affected by treatment with pazopanib 
(see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Votrient has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. A detrimental effect 
on such activities cannot be predicted from the pharmacology of pazopanib. The clinical status of the 
patient and the adverse event profile of pazopanib should be borne in mind when considering the 
patient’s ability to perform tasks that require judgement, motor or cognitive skills. Patients should 
avoid driving or using machines if they feel dizzy, tired or weak.

4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Pooled data from the pivotal RCC study (VEG105192, n=290), the extension study (VEG107769, 
n=71), the supportive Phase II study (VEG102616, n=225) and the randomised, open-label, parallel 
group Phase III non-inferiority study (VEG108844, n=557) were evaluated in the overall evaluation of 
safety and tolerability of pazopanib (total n=1149) in subjects with RCC (see section 5.1). 
Pooled data from the pivotal STS study (VEG110727, n=369) and the supportive Phase II study 
(VEG20002, n=142) was evaluated in the overall evaluation of safety and tolerability of pazopanib 
(total safety population n=382) in subjects with STS (see section 5.1). 
The most important serious adverse reactions identified in the RCC or STS studies were transient 
ischaemic attack, ischaemic stroke, myocardial ischaemia, myocardial and cerebral infarction, cardiac 
dysfunction, gastrointestinal perforation and fistula, QT prolongation, Torsade de Pointes and 
pulmonary, gastrointestinal and cerebral haemorrhage, all adverse reactions being reported in <1% of 
treated patients. Other important serious adverse reactions identified in STS studies included venous 
thromboembolic events, left ventricular dysfunction and pneumothorax. 
Fatal events that were considered possibly related to pazopanib included gastrointestinal haemorrhage, 
pulmonary haemorrhage/haemoptysis, abnormal hepatic function, intestinal perforation and ischaemic 
stroke. 
The most common adverse reactions (experienced by at least 10% of the patients) of any grade in the 
RCC and STS trials included: diarrhoea, hair colour change, skin hypopigmentation, exfoliative rash, 
hypertension, nausea, headache, fatigue, anorexia, vomiting, dysgeusia, stomatitis, weight decreased, 
pain, elevated alanine aminotransferase and elevated aspartate aminotransferase. 
Adverse drug reactions, all grades, which were reported in RCC and STS subjects or during the 
post-marketing period are listed below by MedDRA body system organ class, frequency and grade of 
severity. The following convention has been utilised for the classification of frequency: very common 
(≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); 
very rare (<1/10,000); and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). 
Categories have been assigned based on absolute frequencies in the clinical trial data. Post-marketing 
data on safety and tolerability across all pazopanib clinical studies and from spontaneous reports have 
also been evaluated. Within each system organ class, adverse reactions with the same frequency are 
presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Paediatric population 
The safety profile in paediatric patients was similar to that reported with pazopanib in adults in the 
approved indications based on data from 44 paediatric patients from Phase I study ADVL0815 and 57 
paediatric patients from Phase II study PZP034X2203 (see section 5.1). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.

4.9  Overdose 
Pazopanib doses up to 2000 mg have been evaluated in clinical studies. Grade 3 fatigue (dose-limiting 
toxicity) and Grade 3 hypertension were each observed in 1 of 3 patients dosed at 2000 mg and 
1000 mg daily, respectively. 
There is no specific antidote for overdose with pazopanib and treatment of overdose should consist of 
general supportive measures.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, other protein kinase 
inhibitors, ATC code: L01EX03 
Mechanism of action 
Pazopanib is an orally administered, potent multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) of vascular 
endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) -1, -2, and -3, platelet-derived growth factor 
(PDGFR) -α and –β, and stem cell factor receptor (c-KIT), with IC50 values of 10, 30, 47, 71, 84 and 
74 nM, respectively. In preclinical experiments, pazopanib dose-dependently inhibited ligand-induced 
auto-phosphorylation of VEGFR-2, c-Kit and PDGFR- receptors in cells. In vivo, pazopanib 
inhibited VEGF-induced VEGFR-2 phosphorylation in mouse lungs, angiogenesis in various animal 
models, and the growth of multiple human tumour xenografts in mice. 
Pharmacogenomics 
In a pharmacogenetic meta-analysis of data from 31 clinical studies of pazopanib administered either 
as monotherapy or in combination with other agents, ALT >5 x ULN (NCI CTC Grade 3) occurred in 
19% of HLA-B*57:01 allele carriers and in 10% of non-carriers. In this dataset, 133/2235 (6%) of the 
patients carried the HLA-B*57:01 allele (see section 4.4). 
Clinical studies 
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) 
The safety and efficacy of pazopanib in RCC were evaluated in a randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled multicentre study. Patients (N = 435) with locally advanced and/or metastatic RCC 
were randomised to receive pazopanib 800 mg once daily or placebo. The primary objective of the 
study was to evaluate and compare the two treatment arms for progression-free survival (PFS) and the 
principle secondary endpoint was overall survival (OS). The other objectives were to evaluate the 
overall response rate and duration of response. 
From the total of 435 patients in this study, 233 patients were treatment-naïve and 202 were 
second-line patients who had received one prior IL-2 or INF-based therapy. The performance status 
(ECOG) was similar between the pazopanib and placebo groups (ECOG 0: 42% vs. 41%, ECOG 1: 
58% vs. 59%). The majority of patients had either favourable (39%) or intermediate (54%), MSKCC 
(Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre) / Motzer prognostic factors. All patients had clear cell 
histology or predominantly clear cell histology. Approximately half of all patients had 3 or more 
organs involved in their disease and most patients had the lung (74%), and/or lymph nodes (54%) as a 
metastatic location for disease at baseline. 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A similar proportion of patients in each arm were treatment-naïve and cytokine pre-treated (53% and 
47% in pazopanib arm, 54% and 46% in placebo arm). In the cytokine pre-treated subgroup, the 
majority (75%) had received interferon-based treatment. 
Similar proportions of patients in each arm had prior nephrectomy (89% and 88% in the pazopanib 
and placebo arms, respectively) and/or prior radiotherapy (22% and 15% in the pazopanib and placebo 
arms, respectively. 
The primary analysis of the primary endpoint PFS is based on disease assessment by independent 
radiological review in the entire study population (treatment-naïve and cytokine pre-treated).

For patients who responded to treatment, the median time to response was 11.9 weeks and the median 
duration of response was 58.7 weeks as per independent review (VEG105192). 
The median overall survival (OS) data at the protocol-specified final survival analysis were 
22.9 months and 20.5 months [HR = 0.91 (95% CI: 0.71, 1.16; p = 0.224)] for patients randomised to 
the pazopanib and placebo arms, respectively. The OS results are subject to potential bias as 54% of 
patients in the placebo arm also received pazopanib in the extension part of this study following 
disease progression. Sixty-six per cent of placebo patients received post-study therapy compared to 
30% of pazopanib patients. 
No statistical differences were observed between treatment groups for Global Quality of Life using 
EORTC QLQ-C30 and EuroQoL EQ-5D.

In a Phase II study of 225 patients with locally recurrent or metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma, 
objective response rate was 35% and median duration of response was 68 weeks, as per independent 
review. Median PFS was 11.9 months. 
The safety, efficacy and quality of life of pazopanib versus sunitinib was evaluated in a randomised, 
open-label, parallel group Phase III non-inferiority study (VEG108844). 
In VEG108844, patients (N = 1110) with locally advanced and/or metastatic RCC who had not 
received prior systemic therapy, were randomised to receive either pazopanib 800 mg once daily 
continuously or sunitinib 50 mg once daily in 6-week cycles of dosing with 4 weeks on treatment 
followed by 2 weeks without treatment. 
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate and compare PFS in patients treated with 
pazopanib to those treated with sunitinib. Demographic characteristics were similar between the 
treatment arms. Disease characteristics at initial diagnosis and at screening were balanced between the 
treatment arms with the majority of patients having clear cell histology and Stage IV disease. 
VEG108844 achieved its primary endpoint of PFS and demonstrated that pazopanib was non-inferior 
to sunitinib, as the upper bound of the 95% CI for the hazard ratio was less than the protocol-specified 
non-inferiority margin of 1.25. Overall efficacy results are summarised in Table 5.

Subgroup analyses of PFS were performed for 20 demographic and prognostic factors. The 95% 
confidence intervals for all subgroups include a hazard ratio of 1. In the three smallest of these 
20 subgroups, the point estimate of the hazard ratio exceeded 1.25; i.e. in subjects with no prior 
nephrectomy (n=186, HR=1.403, 95% CI (0.955, 2.061)), baseline LDH >1.5 x ULN (n=68, HR=1.72,

Soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) 
The efficacy and safety of pazopanib in STS were evaluated in a pivotal Phase III randomised, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled multicentre study (VEG110727). A total of 369 patients with 
advanced STS were randomised to receive pazopanib 800 mg once daily or placebo. Importantly, only 
patients with selective histological subtypes of STS were allowed to participate to the study, therefore 
efficacy and safety of pazopanib can only be considered established for those subgroups of STS and 
treatment with pazopanib should be restricted to such STS subtypes. 
The following tumour types were eligible: 
Fibroblastic (adult fibrosarcoma, myxofibrosarcoma, sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma, malignant 
solitary fibrous tumours), so-called fibrohistiocytic (pleomorphic malignant fibrous histiocytoma 
[MFH], giant cell MFH, inflammatory MFH), leiomyosarcoma, malignant glomus tumours, skeletal 
muscles (pleomorphic and alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma), vascular (epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, 
angiosarcoma), uncertain differentiation (synovial, epithelioid, alveolar soft part, clear cell, 
desmoplastic small round cell, extra-renal rhabdoid, malignant mesenchymoma, PEComa, intimal 
sarcoma), malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours, undifferentiated soft tissue sarcomas not 
otherwise specified (NOS) and other types of sarcoma (not listed as ineligible). 
The following tumour types were not eligible: 
Adipocytic sarcoma (all subtypes), all rhabdomyosarcoma that were not alveolar or pleomorphic, 
chondrosarcoma, osteosarcoma, Ewing tumours/primitive neuroectodermal tumours (PNET), GIST, 
dermofibromatosis sarcoma protuberans, inflammatory myofibroblastic sarcoma, malignant 
mesothelioma and mixed mesodermal tumours of the uterus. 
Of note, patients with adipocytic sarcoma were excluded from the pivotal Phase III study as in a 
preliminary Phase II study (VEG20002) activity (PFS at week 12) observed with pazopanib in 
adipocytic did not meet the prerequisite rate to allow further clinical testing. 
Other key eligibility criteria of the VEG110727 study were: histological evidence of high or 
intermediate grade malignant STS and disease progression within 6 months of therapy for metastatic 
disease, or recurrence within 12 months of (neo) -/adjuvant therapy. 
Ninety-eight percent (98%) of subjects received prior doxorubicin, 70% prior ifosfamide, and 65% of 
subjects had received at least three or more chemotherapeutic agents prior to study enrolment. 
Patients were stratified by the factors of WHO performance status (WHO PS) (0 or 1) at baseline and 
the number of lines of prior systemic therapy for advanced disease (0 or 1 vs. 2+). In each treatment 
group, there was a slightly greater percentage of subjects in the 2+ lines of prior systemic therapy for 
advanced disease (58% and 55%, respectively, for placebo and pazopanib treatment arms) compared 
with 0 or 1 lines of prior systemic therapy (42% and 45%, respectively, for placebo and pazopanib 
treatment arms). The median duration of follow-up of subjects (defined as date of randomisation to 
date of last contact or death) was similar for both treatment arms (9.36 months for placebo [range 0.69 
to 23.0 months] and 10.04 months for pazopanib [range 0.2 to 24.3 months]. 
The primary objective of the study was progression-free survival (PFS assessed by independent 
radiological review); the secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), overall response rate and 
duration of response.

Figure 5  Kaplan-Meier Curve for Progression-Free Survival in STS by Independent 
Assessment for the Overall Population (VEG110727) 
No significant difference in OS was observed between the two treatment arms at the final OS analysis 
performed after 76% (280/369) of the events had occurred (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.67, 1.12 p=0.256). 
Paediatric population 
A Phase I study (ADVL0815) of pazopanib was conducted in 44 paediatric patients with various 
recurrent or refractory solid tumours. The primary objective was to investigate the maximum tolerated 
dose (MTD), the safety profile and the pharmacokinetic properties of pazopanib in children. The 
median duration of exposure in this study was 3 months (1-23 months). 
A Phase II study (PZP034X2203) of pazopanib was conducted in 57 paediatric patients with refractory 
solid tumours including rhabdomyosarcoma (N=12), non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma 
(N=11), Ewing sarcoma/pPNET (N=10), osteosarcoma (N=10), neuroblastoma (N=8) and 
hepatoblastoma (N=6). The study was a single-agent, non-controlled, open-label study to determine 
the therapeutic activity of pazopanib in children and adolescents aged 1 to <18 years of age. Pazopanib 
was administered daily as a tablet at a dose of 450 mg/m2/dose or as an oral suspension at 
225 mg/m2/dose. The maximum daily dose permitted was 800 mg for the tablet and 400 mg for the 
oral suspension. The median duration of exposure was 1.8 months (1 day-29 months). 
Results of this study did not show any meaningful anti-tumour activity in the respective paediatric 
population. Pazopanib is therefore not recommended for treatment of these tumours in the paediatric 
population (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Votrient in all subsets of the paediatric population in treatment of kidney and renal pelvis carcinoma 
(excluding nephroblastoma, nephroblastomatosis, clear cell sarcoma, mesoblastic nephroma, renal 
medullary carcinoma and rhabdoid tumour of the kidney) (see section 4.2 for information on 
paediatric use).

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Upon oral administration of a single pazopanib 800 mg dose to patients with solid tumours, maximum 
plasma concentration (Cmax) of approximately 19 ± 13 µg/ml was obtained after median 3.5 hours 
(range 1.0-11.9 hours) and an AUC0-∞ of approximately 650 ± 500 µg.h/ml was obtained. Daily dosing 
results in 1.23- to 4-fold increase in AUC0-T. 
There was no consistent increase in AUC or Cmax at pazopanib doses above 800 mg. 
Systemic exposure to pazopanib is increased when administered with food. Administration of 
pazopanib with a high-fat or low-fat meal results in an approximately 2-fold increase in AUC and 
Cmax. Therefore, pazopanib should be administered at least two hours after food or at least one hour 
before food (see section 4.2). 
Administration of a pazopanib 400 mg crushed tablet increased AUC(0-72) by 46% and Cmax by 
approximately 2 fold and decreased tmax by approximately 2 hours compared to administration of the 
whole tablet. These results indicate that the bioavailability and the rate of pazopanib oral absorption 
are increased after administration of the crushed tablet relative to administration of the whole tablet 
(see section 4.2). 
Distribution 
Binding of pazopanib to human plasma protein in vivo was greater than 99% with no concentration 
dependence over the range of 10-100 g/ml. In vitro studies suggest that pazopanib is a substrate for 
P-gp and BCRP. 
Biotransformation 
Results from in vitro studies demonstrated that metabolism of pazopanib is mediated primarily by 
CYP3A4, with minor contributions from CYP1A2 and CYP2C8. The four principle pazopanib 
metabolites account for only 6% of the exposure in plasma. One of these metabolites inhibits the 
proliferation of VEGF-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells with a similar potency to that 
of pazopanib, the others are 10- to 20-fold less active. Therefore, activity of pazopanib is mainly 
dependent on parent pazopanib exposure. 
Elimination 
Pazopanib is eliminated slowly with a mean half-life of 30.9 hours after administration of the 
recommended dose of 800 mg. Elimination is primarily via faeces with renal elimination accounting 
for <4% of the administered dose. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
Results indicate that less than 4% of an orally administered pazopanib dose is excreted in the urine as 
pazopanib and metabolites. Results from population pharmacokinetic modelling (data from subjects 
with baseline CLCR values ranging from 30.8 ml/min to 150 ml/min) indicated that renal impairment 
is unlikely to have clinically relevant effect on pazopanib pharmacokinetics. No dose adjustment is 
required in patients with creatinine clearance above 30 ml/min. Caution is advised in patients with 
creatinine clearance below 30 ml/min as there is no experience of pazopanib in this patient population 
(see section 4.2).

bilirubin up to 1.5 x ULN regardless of the ALT value) after administration of 800 mg once daily are 
similar to the median in patients with normal hepatic function (see Table 7). 800 mg pazopanib once 
daily is the recommended dose in patients with mild abnormalities of serum liver tests (see 
section 4.2). 
Moderate 
The maximally tolerated pazopanib dose (MTD) in patients with moderate hepatic impairment 
(defined as an elevation of bilirubin >1.5 x to 3 x ULN regardless of the ALT values) was 200 mg 
once daily. The median steady-state Cmax and AUC(0-24) values after administration of 200 mg 
pazopanib once daily in patients with moderate hepatic impairment were approximately 44% and 39%, 
of the corresponding median values after administration of 800 mg once daily in patients with normal 
hepatic function, respectively (see Table 7). 
Based on safety and tolerability data, the dose of pazopanib should be reduced to 200 mg once daily in 
subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (see section 4.2). 
Severe 
The median steady-state Cmax and AUC(0-24) values after administration of 200 mg pazopanib once 
daily in patients with severe hepatic impairment were approximately 18% and 15%, of the 
corresponding median values after administration of 800 mg once daily in patients with normal hepatic 
function. Based on the diminished exposure and limited hepatic reserve pazopanib is not 
recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (defined as total bilirubin >3 X ULN 
regardless of any level of ALT) (see section 4.2).

Paediatric population 
Upon administration of pazopanib 225 mg/m2 (as oral suspension) in paediatric patients, the 
pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax, Tmax and AUC) were similar to those previously reported in adult 
patients treated with 800 mg pazopanib. Results indicated no marked difference in the clearance of 
pazopanib, normalised by body surface area, between children and adults. 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
The preclinical safety profile of pazopanib was assessed in mice, rats, rabbits and monkeys. In repeat 
dose studies in rodents, effects in a variety of tissues (bone, teeth, nail beds, reproductive organs, 
haematological tissues, kidney and pancreas) appear related to the pharmacology of VEGFR inhibition 
and/or disruption of VEGF signalling pathways, with most effects occurring at plasma exposure levels 
below those observed in the clinic. Other observed effects include body weight loss, diarrhoea and/or 
morbidity that were either secondary to local gastrointestinal effects caused by high local mucosal 
medicinal product exposure (monkeys) or pharmacological effects (rodents). Proliferative hepatic 
lesions (eosinophilic foci and adenoma) were seen in female mice at exposures 2.5 times human 
exposure based on AUC. 
In juvenile toxicity studies, when pre-weaning rats were dosed from day 9 post partum through to 
day 14 post partum, pazopanib caused mortalities and abnormal organ growth/maturation in kidney, 
lung, liver and heart, at a dose approximately 0.1 times the clinical exposure based on AUC in adult 
humans. When post-weaning rats were dosed from day 21 post partum to day 62 post partum, 
toxicological findings were similar to adult rats at comparable exposures. Human paediatric patients 
are at increased risk for bone and teeth effects as compared to adults, as these changes, including 
inhibition of growth (shortened limbs), fragile bones and remodelling of teeth, were present in juvenile 
rats at ≥10 mg/kg/day (equal to approximately 0.1-0.2 times the clinical exposure based on AUC in 
adult humans) (see section 4.4). 
Reproductive, fertility and teratogenic effects 
Pazopanib has been shown to be embryotoxic and teratogenic when administered to rats and rabbits at 
exposures more than 300-fold lower than the human exposure (based on AUC). Effects included 
reduced female fertility, increased pre- and post-implantation loss, early resorptions, embryo lethality, 
decreased foetal body weight and cardiovascular malformation. Decreased corpora lutea, increased 
cysts and ovarian atrophy have also been noted in rodents. In a rat male fertility study, there was no 
effect on mating or fertility, but decreased testicular and epididymal weights were noted with 
reductions in sperm production rates, sperm motility, and epididymal and testicular sperm 
concentrations observed at exposures 0.3 times human exposure based on AUC. 
Genotoxicity 
Pazopanib did not cause genetic damage when tested in genotoxicity assays (Ames assay, human 
peripheral lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay and rat in vivo micronucleus). A synthetic 
intermediate in manufacture of pazopanib, which is also present in the final drug substance in low 
amounts, was not mutagenic in the Ames assay but genotoxic in the mouse lymphoma assay and in 
vivo mouse micronucleus assay. 
Carcinogenicity 
In two-year carcinogenicity studies with pazopanib, there were increased numbers of liver adenomas 
noted in mice and duodenal adenocarcinomas noted in rats. Based on the rodent-specific pathogenesis 
and mechanism for these findings, they are not considered to represent an increased carcinogenic risk 
for patients taking pazopanib.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Votrient is and what it is used for 
Votrient is a type of medicine called a protein kinase inhibitor. It works by preventing the activity of 
proteins that are involved in the growth and spread of cancer cells. 
Votrient is used in adults to treat: 
- 
- 
kidney cancer that is advanced or has spread to other organs. 
certain forms of soft-tissue sarcoma, which is a type of cancer that affects the supportive tissues 
of the body. It can occur in muscles, blood vessels, fat tissue or other tissues that support, 
surround and protect the organs. 
49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  What you need to know before you take Votrient 
Do not take Votrient 
- 
if you are allergic to pazopanib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
Check with your doctor if you think this applies to you. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking Votrient: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
if you have heart disease. 
if you have liver disease. 
if you have had heart failure or a heart attack. 
if you have had prior collapse of a lung. 
if you have had problems with bleeding, blood clots or narrowing of the arteries. 
if you have had stomach or bowel problems such as perforation (hole) or fistula (abnormal 
passages forming between parts of the intestine). 
if you have thyroid problems. 
if you have problems with your kidney function. 
if you have or have had an aneurysm (enlargement and weakening of a blood vessel wall) or a 
tear in a blood vessel wall. 
- 
- 
- 
Tell your doctor if any of these apply to you. Your doctor will decide whether Votrient is suitable for 
you. You may need extra tests to check that your kidneys, heart and liver are working properly. 
High blood pressure and Votrient 
Votrient can raise your blood pressure. Your blood pressure will be checked before you take Votrient 
and while you are taking it. If you have high blood pressure you will be treated with medicines to 
reduce it. 
- 
Tell your doctor if you have high blood pressure. 
If you are going to have an operation 
Your doctor will stop Votrient at least 7 days before your operation as it may affect wound healing. 
Your treatment will be restarted when the wound has adequately healed. 
Conditions you need to look out for 
Votrient can make some conditions worse or cause serious side effects. You must look out for certain 
symptoms while you are taking Votrient to reduce the risk of any problems. See section 4. 
Children and adolescents 
Votrient is not recommended for people aged under 18. It is not yet known how well it works in this 
age group. Moreover it should not be used in children younger than 2 years of age because of safety 
concerns. 
50 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Other medicines and Votrient 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other 
medicines. This includes herbal medicines and other medicines you’ve bought without a prescription. 
Some medicines may affect how Votrient works or make it more likely that you’ll have side effects. 
Votrient can also affect how some other medicines work. These include: 
- 
clarithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, rifamicin, telithromycin, voriconazzole (used to 
treat infection). 
atazanavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir (used to treat HIV). 
nefazodone (used to treat depression). 
simvastatin and possibly other statins (used to treat high cholesterol levels). 
medicines that reduce stomach acid. The type of medicine that you are taking to reduce your 
stomach acid (e.g. proton pump inhibitor, H2 antagonists or antacids) may affect how Votrient is 
taken. Please consult your doctor or nurse for advice. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you take any of these. 
Votrient with food and drink 
Don’t take Votrient with food, as it affects the way the medicine is absorbed. Take it at least two 
hours after a meal or one hour before a meal (see section 3). 
Do not drink grapefruit juice while you are being treated with Votrient as this may increase the 
chance of side effects. 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
Votrient is not recommended if you are pregnant. The effect of Votrient during pregnancy is not 
known. 
- 
- 
Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or planning to get pregnant. 
Use a reliable method of contraception while you’re taking Votrient, and at least for 2 weeks 
after, to prevent pregnancy. 
If you do become pregnant during treatment with Votrient, tell your doctor. 
- 
Don’t breast-feed while taking Votrient. It is not known whether the ingredients in Votrient pass 
into breast milk. Talk to your doctor about this. 
Male patients (including those who have had vasectomies) who have partners who are either pregnant 
or who could become pregnant (including those who use other methods of contraception) should use 
condoms during sexual intercourse while taking Votrient and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose. 
Fertility may be affected by treatment with Votrient. Talk to your doctor about this. 
Driving and using machines 
Votrient can have side effects that may affect your ability to drive or use machines. 
- 
Avoid driving or using machines if you feel dizzy, tired or weak, or if your energy levels are 
low. 
Votrient contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per film-coated tablet, that is to say 
essentially ‘sodium-free’.

3. 
How to take Votrient 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or 
pharmacist if you are not sure. 
How much to take 
The usual dose is 800 mg taken once a day. The dose can be taken as 2 tablets of 400 mg or as 
4 tablets of 200 mg. The dose of 800 mg once a day is the maximum dose per day. Your doctor may 
need to reduce your dose if you get side effects. 
When to take 
Don’t take Votrient with food. Take it at least two hours after a meal, or one hour before a meal. 
For example, you could take it two hours after breakfast or one hour before lunch. Take Votrient at 
about the same time each day.

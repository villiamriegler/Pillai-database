The procedure started on 23 September 1996. 
The  Rapporteur's  first  assessment  report  was  circulated  to  all  CPMP  Members  on 
11  November  1996.  The  Co-Rapporteur’s  first  assessment  report  was  circulated  to  all  CPMP 
Members on 13 November 1996. 
During the plenary meeting on 20-22 January 1997, the CPMP agreed on the consolidated list of 
questions to be sent to the company. 
The company submitted the responses to the consolidated list of questions on 13 February 1997. 
The Rapporteur/Co-Rapporteur circulated a joint assessment report dated 13 March 1997 on the 
company’s responses to the list of questions to all CPMP Members. 
On  25  March  1997,  the  Rapporteur  circulated  further  assessment  report  on  the  company’s 
responses to the remaining clinical issues. 
The  CPMP,  during  its  meeting  on  14-17  April  concluded  that  the  responses  provided  by  the 
company  were  satisfactory.  The  reference  to  one  single  laboratory  for  performance  of  the 
analysis  was  discussed.  It  was  agreed  that  qualified  laboratories  should  be  in  the  position  to 
carry  out  the  analysis  provided  that  a  suitably  validated  method  is  used.  Consequently,  the 
relevant information on Analysis of breath samples and testing specification was included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (section 6.7), and in the Package Leaflet as a tear-off part 
(section 13). 
The  CPMP  adopted  on  16  April  1997  a  positive  opinion  for  granting  of  a  Marketing 
Authorisation for Helicobacter Test INFAI. 
The  CPMP  opinions  were  forwarded,  in  all  official  languages  of  the  European  Union,  to  the 
European Commission, which adopted the corresponding Decision on 14 August 1997.

Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan 
This  is  a  summary  of  the  risk  management  plan  (RMP)  for  SCENESSE®.  The  RMP  details 
important  risks  of  SCENESSE®,  how  these  risks  can  be  minimised,  and  how  more  information 
will be obtained about SCENESSE®'s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
SCENESSE®'s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how SCENESSE® should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for SCENESSE®  should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important  new  concerns  or  changes  to  the  current  ones  will  be  included  in  updates  of 
SCENESSE®'s RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
SCENESSE® is authorised for EPP (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains afamelanotide as 
the active substance and it is given as a controlled release injectable implant. 
Further  information  about  the  evaluation  of  the  benefits  of  SCENESSE®  can  be  found  in  the 
medicine’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under 
the medicine’s webpage https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/scenesse 
II. Risks associated  with the medicine and activities to minimise or further characterise 
the risks  
Important risks of SCENESSE®, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about the risks of SCENESSE®, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific  information,  such  as  warnings,  precautions,  and  advice  on  correct  use,  in  the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
•  Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In the case of  SCENESSE®, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimisation 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly  analysed,  including  PSUR  assessment,  so  that  immediate  action  can  be  taken  as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of SCENESSE® is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below.

II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of SCENESSE® are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate  or  minimise  the  risk,  so  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  safely  administered. 
Important  risks  can  be  regarded  as  identified  or  potential.  Identified  risks  are  concerns  for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of SCENESSE®. Potential risks are concerns 
for  which  an  association  with  the  use  of  this  medicine is  possible  based  on  available  data,  but 
this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information 
refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs 
to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine);

Important identified risk: Change of pigmentary expressions  
Evidence  for  linking  the  risk 
to the medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
SCENESSE® increases the level of melanin pigment in the skin 
and makes the skin darker. When taking SCENESSE® the 
contrast in the colour of already darker skin areas (e.g. 
ephelides, sun spots etc, collectively ‘pigmentary expressions’) 
and the surrounding skin can become more intense. It is 
important to monitor these areas to make sure that any 
change observed is only a result of the drug’s normal activity 
and that is does not mask a skin condition. Any darkening of 
pigmentary expressions induced by SCENESSE® is reversible. 
The risk factors for the development of changes in pigmentary 
expressions are many and varied and largely depend on the 
individual’s phenotype, personal medical history, family 
medical history and environmental factors such as previous 
chronic sunlight exposure.

Special caution is warranted in patients with: 
• 
• 
• 
individual or family history of melanoma (cancer 
that develops from the pigment-containing cells 
known as melanocytes)  
suspected or confirmed susceptibility to melanoma 
(see above) of the skin, and/or 
individual history of basal cell carcinoma 
(cancer that grows on parts of your skin that get a 
lot of sun), squamous cell carcinoma (second most 
common form of skin cancer), or other malignant 
or premalignant skin lesions.

Important identified risk: Allergy and hypersensitivity  
Evidence  for  linking  the  risk 
to the medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
The body’s immune system helps to fight infections by 
recognising unknown substances. However, sometimes the 
immune system can also respond to medicines and this 
reaction is known as an allergy or hypersensitivity. 
SCENESSE® is a new drug which has only been tested in a 
limited number of patients. As with any drug, there is a 
possibility that some patients may experience an allergic 
reaction to the drug or any of its components. 
Patients with a predisposition to allergic reactions and/or a 
history of hyper-reactivity to proteins and/or polymers are 
considered at greater risk. 
Risk minimisation measures  Routine risk minimisation measures: 
SmPC section 4.3. and 4.8. 
SmPC section 4.2. states that the patient needs to be observed 
for 30 minutes to ensure that he/she does not experience

Important potential risk: Administration error 
Evidence  for  linking  the  risk 
to the medicine 
The implant is administered using a catheter needle; the risk 
of damage to the implant during the administration can on 
theoretical grounds not be excluded. The route of 
administration poses a risk for patients with respect to non-
maintenance of sterile conditions in clinical practice and also 
with respect to application site reactions.

Risk factors and risk groups 
SCENESSE® has never been fully evaluated in children. 
Children up to 17 years of age suffering from EPP must not be 
administered SCENESSE® as safety and efficacy in children 
have not been demonstrated. 
It is conceivable that there may be a temptation to treat 
adolescents close to 18 years of age may because of their 
closeness to the adult age threshold. Similar considerations 
may also apply to younger children of a larger body size.

Risk factors and risk groups 
SCENESSE® has never been fully evaluated in conditions other 
than EPP. SCENESSE® should not be used in other patient 
populations as safety and efficacy in these patients have not 
been demonstrated. 
It is theoretically possible that there may be a temptation to 
treat some adult patients off-label because of the perceived 
benefits of afamelanotide. However, the approval procedures 
that have to be followed before SCENESSE® is provided, as 
well as the medical specialisations involved in treating EPP 
patients at EEECs and their patient populations make the 
probability of off-label use other than via an approved 
controlled distribution program negligible.

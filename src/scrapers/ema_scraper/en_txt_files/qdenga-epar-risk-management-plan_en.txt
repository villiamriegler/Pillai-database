Rationale for submitting an updated RMP:  
The rationale of the update of RMP version 0.4 to RMP version 1.0 to remove study DEN-401 from 
the RMP and instead, include the study in the list of post-authorization measures. In addition, RMP 
was updated to reflect the DEN-303 trial protocol amendment (amendment to protocol version 4.0, 
22 February 2021 to version 5.0, 22 August 2022).

Part  II:  Module  SI  -  Epidemiology  of  the  indication(s)  and 
target population(s) 
Qdenga is indicated for the prevention of dengue disease in individuals from 4 years of age. 
Incidence: 
Dengue is caused by infection with the wild-type dengue virus serotype (DENV), a 
ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus that occurs as 4 recognized serotypes, DENV-1, DENV-
2,  DENV-3  or  DENV-4.  These  dengue  viruses  are  transmitted  from  human  to 
human  by  mosquitoes  (primarily  Aedes  aegypti)  [1].  The  4  dengue  viruses  have 
spread  worldwide  and  are  now  endemic  in  more  than  120  countries  throughout 
Asia, the Pacific Islands, the Caribbean, parts of Africa, Australia, and Central and 
South America, with almost 3.9 billion people thought to be at risk [2]. 
Due to under-recognition, under-reporting, and passive surveillance systems at the 
national level, the actual global burden of dengue is difficult to quantify. Access to 
and  the  reliability  of  national  data  poses  additional  challenges  for  estimating  the 
dengue  burden  [3].  The  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  frequently  cites  50  to 
100  million  as  the  annual  number  of  symptomatic  cases  of  dengue  [4].  Using 
geostatistical methods, modelling groups estimated that 294 million asymptomatic 
infections  and  96  million  symptomatic  infections  occurred  in  2010,  of  which  70% 
were in Asia, 16% were in Africa, and 14% were in the Americas [5]. 
Over  the  past  20  years,  the  number  of  dengue  cases  reported  to  the  WHO 
increased more than 8-fold [6], from less than 505,430 cases in 2000, to over 2.4 
million  in  2010,  and  4.2  million  in  2019.  From  a  sub-regional  perspective, 
Southeast  Asia  has  the  highest  age-standardized  incidence,  estimated  at 
34.3 cases/1000  people  annually.  Within  Latin  America,  the  Caribbean  has  the 
highest age-standardized incidence, with 18.2 cases/1000 people [3]. 
Details for some of the highest burdened countries are below: 
Indonesia 
Indonesia, which is comprised of more than 17,000 islands and 260 million people, 
is the most populous country in Southeast Asia. It is hyperendemic for dengue and 
is  consistently  estimated  to  be  among  the  three  countries  in  the  world  with  the 
largest dengue burden [7]. 
In Indonesia, outbreaks of Dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) appear to be cyclical, 
occurring every 6 to 8 years. Since 2000, outbreaks of DHF in Indonesia occurred 
in 2009 (IR  =66/100k)  and 2016 (IR = 78/100k),  which coincided with a shift in 
the  dominant  serotype  from  DENV-3  to  DENV-1  and  DENV-2  [8,9].  In  2017, 
Indonesia  reported  59,047  DHF  cases  and  444  DHF-associated  deaths 
(IR = 23/100k,  Case  Fatality  Rate  (CFR)  =  0.75%)  [8].  However,  dengue 
surveillance  throughout  Indonesia  is  known  to  be  highly  variable  and  incomplete 
[10]. A 2013 cartographical based model estimated that 7.6 million dengue cases 
occurred in Indonesia in 2010 [5]. 
A  seroprevalence  study  in  2014  of  30  geographically  dispersed  clusters  found 
53.1%  of  5  to  9  year  olds  had  previously  been  exposed  to  at  least  one  dengue 
infection, with a median age of seroconversion estimated at 4.8 years [11].

Malaysia 
Malaysia,  a  country  of  31.6  million  inhabitants,  is  spread  across  the  Malay 
Peninsula  and Borneo.  Over  the past 10  years, the  burden  of dengue in  Malaysia 
has  fluctuated  considerably.  From  2009  to  2019,  there  were  on  average 
72,339 suspected  cases  reported  to  the  national  surveillance  system  annually, 
ranging from 19,884 cases in 2011 to 130,101 cases in 2019 [12]. All four dengue 
serotypes circulate in Malaysia, with shifts in dominance. Between 2014 and 2017, 
DENV-1 and DENV-2 were most prominent [13]. 
A seroprevalence survey among 9 to 12-years old in Penang and Kuala Lumpur in 
2011  found  34%  of  children  had  previously  been  exposed  to  dengue  [14].  While 
the majority of dengue cases in Malaysia are among children, in recent years there 
has been a shift in the age profile of cases to individuals older than 15 years [15]. 
A retrospective observational  study  of dengue  mortality in Malaysia in 2013-2014 
found  10%  of  fatal  dengue  cases  to  be  among  children  less  than  15  years,  while 
the majority of deaths were adults from the working age group [16]. 
Singapore 
Singapore  is  an  equatorial  city-state  with  approximately  5.6  million  inhabitants. 
For  the  past  30  years,  Singapore  has  experienced  periodic  dengue  epidemics  of 
increasing  frequency  and  magnitude,  despite  a  strong  vector  control  program 
which  has  reduced  the  percentage  of  houses  infested  with  Aedes  larvae  to  below 
1% [17]. 
Between 2009 and 2019, an average of 9,704 laboratory confirmed dengue cases 
were reported in Singapore, ranging from 2,767 in 2017 to a record high of 22,170 
in 2013. During this time period, DENV-1 and DENV-2 predominated [18]. In 2020, 
Singapore  experienced  its  largest  dengue  outbreak  on  record,  with  more  than 
35,300  cases  reported  [19].  This  record  year  was  driven  in  part  by  a  serotype 
switch  to  DENV-3,  which  had  not  predominated  in  Singapore  for  more  than 
30 years [20]. 
A 2017 seroprevalence survey among Singaporean residents 16 to 74 years found 
a dengue IgG prevalence of 45.7% among persons sampled. Seropositivity ranged 
from  13.8%  among  residents  aged  16  to  20  years  to  85%  among  those  over 
60 years [21]. 
Sri Lanka 
Sri  Lanka  is  an  island  nation  of  21.4  million  inhabitants.  From  2010-2016, 
Sri Lanka reported an average of 38,802 annual suspected dengue cases. In 2017, 
Sri  Lanka  experienced  its  largest  outbreak  on  record,  with  more  than  186,000 
suspected cases. Before the 2017 epidemic, the largest outbreak that occurred in 
Sri  Lanka  was  in  2014,  with  47,502  reported  suspected  cases  [22].  All  four 
serotypes circulate in Sri Lanka annually, but the 2017 outbreak was predominated 
by  DENV-2  [23].  The  majority  of  cases  reported  during  the  2017  outbreak  were 
among working-age adults [24]. 
A  2007  seroprevalence  study  in  Southern  Sri  Lanka  found  that  dengue 
seroprevalence  reached  70%  by  40  years  of  age.  However,  an  updated  study 
conducted  in  the  same  area  in  2012,  found  nearly  70%  of  20  years  olds  to  be 
seropositive, and seropositivity reached 90% among 60 to 65 years olds [25]. 
Thailand 
Across Thailand’s 76 provinces, 13 health regions, and 69.4 million people, there is 
considerable  geographic  and  annual  variation  in  the  burden  of  dengue.  Between

2009  and  2019,  an  average  of  89,846  suspected  dengue  cases  were  reported  in 
Thailand annually, ranging from 41,082 in 2014 to 154,000 in 2013  [26]. Dengue 
has  been  hyperendemic  in  Thailand  since  1958  [27],  and  a  recent  study  found  a 
high incidence of DENV serotype and genotype co-circulation, particularly in urban 
areas [28]. 
Over the past few decades, the age of first infection has increased in Thailand. This 
increase in average age of first infection may in part be due to a significant shift in 
the demographics of the Thai population over the past few decades [29]. However, 
children  are  still  significantly  impacted  by  dengue  in  Thailand.  A  dengue 
seroprevalence  survey  in  Ratchaburi  and  Kamphaeng  Phet  conducted  in  2011 
found nearly 80% of 9 to 12 years old had already been exposed to dengue [14]. 
Argentina 
Argentina,  a  country  of  44.5  million  inhabitants,  remained  free  from  dengue  for 
more than 80 years before the disease was reintroduced in 1997 in Salta Province. 
Since  then,  locally  acquired  dengue  cases  have  only  been  reported  from  the 
northern provinces of the country, though the Aedes aegypti mosquito has spread 
southward to latitude 35°S, near Buenos Aires [30]. 
Between  2009  and  2019  the  average  number  of  reported  cases in  Argentina  was 
17,413,  ranging  from  213  cases  in  2011  to  79,455  cases  (41,211  confirmed)  in 
2016. In 2020, Argentina reported a record dengue season, with 58,415 confirmed 
cases  [31].  Three  serotypes  have  cocirculated  during  2020,  with  DENV-1 
predominating [32]. 
During  the  2020  outbreak,  the  20  to  34-year-old  age  group  had  the  highest 
number  of  cases  and  highest  incidence  rate,  followed  by  35  to  44  and  10  to  19. 
A 2016 seroprevalence survey among 266 affiliates at the Universidad Nacional de 
Misiones  and  Universidad  Católica  de  las  Misiones  found  6.6%  to  be  seropositive 
for dengue [33]. 
Brazil 
Brazil  is  home  to  209.5  million  people  and  is  hyperendemic  for  dengue.  Between 
2009  and  2019,  an  average  of  986,053  suspected  dengue  cases  were  reported 
annually, ranging from 252,054 in 2017 to 2.25 million in 2019 [31]. By far, Brazil 
has the largest dengue burden in Latin America. Among all dengue cases that were 
recorded  in  the  Americas  in  2019,  more  than  70%  were  from  Brazil  [31].  Even 
still,  dengue  is  under  reported  in  Brazil,  with  one  notification  estimated  for  every 
twenty cases of dengue fever [34]. 
Every  year  for  the  past  10  years,  Brazil  has  reported  the  cocirculation  of  all  four 
dengue  serotypes.[31]  Epidemics  occurred  in  2010,  2013,  2015,  2016  and  2019, 
marked  by  reintroduction  of  new  serotypes  (in  2010  and  2013)  as  well  as  the 
introduction  of  new  arboviruses  (Chikungunya  and  Zika  virus  in  2015  and  2016) 
[35]. 
A  recent  dengue  seroprevalence  study  conducted  in  Fortaleza,  Natal,  Vitoria, 
Goiania, and Campo Grande found 68% of 9 to 12-year olds to be seropositive for 
dengue [14]. 
Colombia 
Colombia has a population of 49.7 million people and has historically been among 
the  highest  dengue  burden  countries  in  the  Americas.  Between  2009  and  2019, 
Colombia’s  dengue  surveillance  system  reported  an  average  of  79,634  suspected 
cases,  ranging  from  25,284  in  2017  to  138,188  in  2010.  During  most  years,

Version 1.0 
multiple  dengue  serotypes  circulate  in  Colombia.  In  2019,  DENV-1,  DENV-2,  and 
DENV-3 were detected. DENV-4 was last reported in Colombia in 2016 [36]. 
A  dengue  seroprevalence  study  conducted  in  Bucaramanga,  Armenia,  Tebaida, 
Calarca, Montenegro, Giarardot, Acacias, Yopal and Aguazul found 91% of 9 to 12-
year olds to be seropositive for dengue [14]. 
Mexico 
Dengue  transmission  in  Mexico,  a  country  of  126.2  million  inhabitants,  is 
heterogenous  between  and  within  regions.  Sustained  dengue  transmission  occurs 
on  both  coasts,  as  well  as  in  some  central  states,  namely  Morelos  and  Huasteca 
[37].  Between  2009  and  2019,  the  average  number  of  suspected  dengue  cases 
reported by the national surveillance system was 151,094, ranging from 51,635 in 
2010  to  268,458  in  2019  [31].  All  four  dengue  serotypes  generally  circulate 
annually  in  Mexico.  In  2019,  all  four  serotypes  were  detected,  with  DENV-2 
predominating [38]. 
A dengue seroprevalence study conducted in Temixco, Veracruz, Valladolid, Ciudad 
Mante, and Tizimin  Mexico  found  48%  of 9  to 12-year olds to  be seropositive for 
dengue [14]. 
Travellers 
Travel-acquired  dengue  cases  have  been  increasing  as  the  overall  global  dengue 
burden has expanded. Among travellers returning from Southeast Asia, dengue is 
a  more  frequent  cause  of  febrile  illness  than  malaria  [39],  and  accounts  for  an 
estimated  2%  of  all  febrile  illnesses  in  travellers  returning  from  the  tropics  [16, 
40]. 
tracking  self-limiting 
However, the true burden of dengue among travellers is likely much higher due to 
variability  in  reporting,  misdiagnosis,  and  the  methodological  challenges  involved 
in 
travellers  [39].  A  prospective 
seroconversion  study  of  travellers  to  dengue  endemic  countries  estimated  an 
incidence  of  2.9%  in  Dutch  travellers  who  spent  approximately  1  month  in  Asia 
[41].  Travellers  returning  home  with  dengue  also  contribute  to  the  spread  of  the 
disease  to  non-endemic  areas  where  Aedes  aegypti  and  Aedes  albopictus 
mosquitoes are present [42]. 
illnesses  among 
Dengue in Europe 
Sporadic  dengue  outbreaks  have  been  recorded  over  the  past  decade  in 
continental  Europe,  including  in  Croatia  (2010),  France  (2010,  2013-2015,  2018, 
2019), Spain (2018), and Italy (2020) [43-45]. An outbreak on the Madeira island 
(Portugal) in 2012 resulted in over 2,000 cases and imported cases were detected 
in  mainland  Portugal  and  10  other  European  countries.  In  many  European 
countries, autochthonous cases are observed on an almost annual basis [46]. 
Dengue in European territories 
Several European territories are endemic for dengue: 
Reunion  Island,  a  French  department  in  the  Indian  Ocean  of  about  840,000 
inhabitants,  experienced  an  outbreak  of  dengue  in  2018  with  more  than  6,000 
reported  suspected  infections.  Aedes  albopictus,  the  primary  vector  of  this 
outbreak, are also widely established in the European Union [44]. 
Mayotte is a French territory  between  Madagascar and Mozambique with 256,000 
inhabitants.  A  representative  seroprevalence  study  of  1,154  inhabitants  aged 
≥2 years  in  Mayotte  in  2006  found  23%  IgG  antibody  seropositivity,  indicating

substantial prior exposure of dengue among the population of Mayotte [47]. 
French  Guiana  is  an  overseas  department  of  France  with  nearly  300,000 
inhabitants.  French  Guiana  first  reported  a  case  of  DHF  in  1992.  Over  the  past 
decade,  French  Guiana  has  experienced  dengue  hyperendemicity,  and  reported 
outbreaks in 2009, 2010, 2013 and 2020 [48]. 
Madeira, an autonomous region of Portugal with a population of 289,000, reported 
2,168  probable  dengue  cases  during  its  first  dengue  outbreak  from  September 
2012 to March 2013.  Of the suspected  cases,  1,080  were confirmed. The dengue 
outbreak  in  Madeira  led  to  many  cases  of  imported  cases  in  other  European 
countries including 11 in Portugal, 19 in Germany, 7 in Finland, 5 in Sweden, 3 in 
France, 2 in Denmark, 2 in Austria, 2 in Norway, 1  in Croatia, 1 in Slovenia, 1 in 
Spain, and 1 in Switzerland [43]. 
In  Martinique  and  Guadeloupe,  overseas  regions  of  France,  dengue  is  highly 
endemic.  A  2011  serosurvey  conducted  among  783  adult  blood  donors  in 
Guadeloupe  and  Martinique  found  93.5%  [91.5;  95.1]  samples  were  positive 
for dengue antibodies, 90.7% (350 of 386) in Martinique and  96.2% (382 of 397) 
in Guadeloupe.  Of  the  adults  who  tested  positive,  only  30%  recalled  having 
had dengue [49]. 
In  New  Caledonia,  a  special  collectivity  of  France  with  a  population  of  278,000, 
dengue occurs regularly. In 2018, 20, 30 dengue cases including two deaths were 
reported.  DENV-2  was  the  predominant  circulating  serotype,  comprising  1,149  of 
the 1,336 (86%) typed cases [50]. 
French  Polynesia,  the  only  overseas  country  of  France,  with  118  islands  in  the 
South Pacific Ocean, has 276,000 inhabitants. A 2014-2015 serosurvey across the 
islands  using  a  cluster  sampling  approach  found  the  majority  of  the  general 
population  (96%±3%)  had  been  exposed  to  more  than  one  dengue  serotype  in 
2014.  Among  schoolchildren,  the  seroprevalence  was  60%±5%.  These  rates  of 
seroprevalence  are  indicative  of  high  transmission  rates  throughout  French 
Polynesia [51]. 
In  Wallis  and  Futuna,  a  French  island  collectivity  in  the  South  Pacific  with  about 
12,000  people,  225  cases  were  confirmed  since  November  2017,  putting  the 
islands  above  the  epidemic  threshold.  Young  people  between  5  and  20  years 
represented more than half of all confirmed cases. The death of an 8 year old girl 
due to dengue was also reported during this epidemic [52]. 
Saint Barthelemy, an overseas collectivity of France with about 10,000 inhabitants, 
is endemic for dengue. In 2015, Saint Barthelemy reported 428 cases of dengue to 
PAHO, an incidence rate of 4,280/100,000 [53]. 
Saint  Martin  is  divided  between  the  French  Republic  and  the  Kingdom  of  the 
Netherlands,  with  about  77,000  inhabitants.  The  first  dengue  outbreak  identified 
on Saint Martin occurred in 1997. Since then, many outbreaks have occurred, most 
recently  in  2013  and  2014,  with  4,020  reported  cases,  40  hospitalizations, 
2 deaths.  In  Saint  Martin,  three  serotypes  co-circulated  during  this  outbreak: 
DENV-1, DENV-2 and DENV-4, with serotype 1 predominating [54]. 
Aruba  is  a  constituent  country  of  the  Kingdom  of  the  Netherlands  with  105,000 
inhabitants. In 2011, 2,850 cases of dengue were reported. Over the past decade, 
outbreaks were reported in 2009 (3,210 reported cases) and 2011 (2,850 cases). 
In 2014, 833 cases were reported [55]. 
Curaçao is  a  constituent  country  of  the  Kingdom  of  the  Netherlands  with  a 
population of 160,000. In 2014, Curacao health authorities reported 194 suspected

dengue cases (IR = 131/100,000) and 20 confirmed cases. No information on the 
number of dengue cases reported in subsequent years has been reported [56]. 
Prevalence: 
Dengue  is  an  acute  disease  and  therefore  the  burden  is  best  characterized  by 
incidence.  Seroprevalence  rates,  however,  are  informative  as  a  measure  of  past 
exposure in a specific population at a given time. 
Dengue seroprevalence data from studies in Latin America and Asia in 2011 found 
more  than  75%  of  9  to  12-year-old  children  participating  in  the  study  have 
previously  been  exposed  to  dengue  [14].  However,  dengue  transmission  is 
spatially heterogenous, and the force of infection can be highly variable within and 
across countries. In Singapore, for example, only 16% of 16 to 20 year olds have 
previously  been  exposed,  and  in  Thailand,  schools  located  within  the  same 
municipality  have  been  shown  to  have  significantly  different  transmission 
intensities [29,57]. 
Demographics 
of the target 
population in 
the indication: 
Age: 
People of all ages are at risk of dengue infection [58]. Though the data are limited, 
the results of some studies suggest that elderly dengue patients have the highest 
dengue case-fatality rates [59-61]. 
In  Southeast  Asia,  dengue  has  historically  been  a  paediatric  disease  and  clinical 
dengue  in  adults  has  been  rare  [62].  Throughout  the  region,  the  majority  of 
children in endemic areas have already had a primary dengue infection before the 
age of 9 years [14]. In Asia, DHF and Dengue shock syndrome (DSS) mostly occur 
in  children  aged  2  to  15  years  [63].  However,  data  from  Singapore,  Malaysia, 
Indonesia,  Thailand,  and  Bangladesh  point  to  a  recent  increase  in  dengue 
incidence  among  older  age  groups  [29,64-67].  A  study  from  Thailand  indicated 
that  this  shift  in  age  profile  is,  in  part,  driven  by  changes  in  the  age  structure  of 
the Thai population over the last 30 years [29,68,69]. Other factors contributing to 
this  shift  in  the  age  burden  include  increased  urbanization,  a  decrease  in  mean 
household  size, 
in 
socioeconomics,  increases  in  vector  control,  and  educational  campaigns  against 
dengue [70,71]. 
in  sanitation  and  water, 
improvements 
increases 
In  Latin  America,  first  infections  have  generally  been  among  young  adults  and 
severe  disease  occurs  in  a  significant  number  of  adults  [72].  Recently,  however, 
Latin America has seen an important increase in dengue incidence among children, 
leading to an epidemiological shift that is beginning to resemble the historical age 
profile seen in Southeast Asia [73]. 
In  Brazil,  this  shift  has  been  shown  to  be  partly  attributed  to  an  increase  in 
multitypic  immunity  in  adults  over  time  following the  re-emergence  of  DENV-1  in 
1986,  DENV-2  in  1990,  and  DENV-3  in  2002.  As  such,  the  probability  of  being 
dengue  naive  into  adulthood  has  been  reduced,  resulting  in  a  decrease  in  the 
average  age  of  infection  [74,75].  Increases  in  multitypic  immunity  among  adults 
may also explain the recent increase in severe dengue observed among children in 
Colombia, Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Mexico [76-78]. 
Gender: 
Data  regarding  differences  in  dengue  vulnerability  by  gender  are  mixed  and  vary 
by time, place, and study  methodology.  Whether differences  observed are  due to 
the pathogenesis process, immune response, exposure to the vector, or related to 
treatment seeking behaviour remains unclear [79-82].

Racial and/or ethnic origin: 
Some  association  has  been  described  for  people  of  African  genetic  ancestry  who 
are less affected by severe dengue outcomes [83,84]. No other ethnic groups have 
been identified as being at higher or lower risk of severe disease. 
Risk factors for 
the disease: 
Variations  in  risk  of  dengue  are  influenced  by  rainfall,  temperature,  population 
density,  urbanization,  poverty,  poor  sanitary  conditions,  domestic  water  supplies, 
and  vector  control.  Globalization,  migration,  international  travel  and  climate 
change also play a role in the geographic expansion of dengue [85,86]. 
At  the  individual  level,  the  relative  risk  of  developing  severe  dengue  has  been 
shown to be significantly higher among persons with a secondary dengue infection 
of a heterologous DENV serotype compared to those who have a primary infection 
[78,87-92]. 
Numerous  factors  are  also  known  to  influence  the  severity  of  disease,  including: 
co-morbidities,  nutritional  status,  the  two  extremes  of  age,  genetic  composition, 
pregnancy, and the time interval since primary infection [76,90,93-99]. 
The main 
existing 
treatment 
options: 
There is no specific treatment for dengue. Treatment of dengue is based solely on 
symptoms  and  signs,  with  maintenance  of  the  patient’s  body  fluid  volume  critical 
for haemorrhagic or shock cases [100]. 
Dengvaxia is the only dengue vaccine to have been commercialized  to  date, with 
licensure  by  regulatory  authorities  in  multiple  endemic  countries  [101].  In 
December 2018, Dengvaxia received approval in the EU [102]. 
Natural history 
of the 
indicated 
condition in 
the 
unvaccinated 
population, 
including 
mortality and 
morbidity: 
Twenty-five  percent  of  dengue  infections  are  thought  to  be  symptomatic  [5]. 
Clinically,  infection  with  a  dengue  virus  can  result  in  a  range  of  symptoms,  often 
with unpredictable clinical progression and outcome  [103]. The 2009 WHO clinical 
classification  for  dengue  diagnosis  and  management  divides  dengue  into  two 
groups:  uncomplicated  and  severe.  Uncomplicated  dengue  is  clinically  defined  as 
an  acute  febrile  illness  with  two  or  more  manifestations  (headache,  retro-orbital 
pain,  myalgia,  arthralgia,  rash,  or  haemorrhagic  manifestations)  [100].  Severe 
dengue  occurs  in  a  small  fraction  of  cases  (<5%),  and  is  associated  with  severe 
bleeding,  severe  organ  dysfunction,  and/or  severe  plasma  leakage  [100,104]. 
Illness rarely lasts beyond 10 days, though some symptoms can be persistent and 
debilitating  [100,105].  Without  appropriate  treatment,  fatality  rates  can  exceed 
20%, however, with proper case management, the rate can be less than 1% [46]. 
The  WHO  estimates  about  500,000  people  with  severe  dengue  require 
hospitalization annually, and about 2.5% of those affected die [6]. 
Important co-
morbidities: 
Everyone in dengue endemic areas is deemed to be susceptible to dengue infection 
and disease. There are no known risk groups for uncomplicated dengue. 
Comorbidities  that  may  predispose  individuals  to  severe  forms  of  dengue  include 
cardiovascular  disease,  hypertension,  stroke,  diabetes,  respiratory  disease,  renal 
disease,  hepatitis  B  or  C,  and  Human  immunodeficiency  virus  (HIV)  [106-108]. 
Obesity and advanced  age  are  also associated  with more severe forms of dengue 
[106,109].

All  toxicity  studies  were  Good  Laboratory  Practice  (GLP)  compliant  except  for  the  Pilot  toxicology 
study (DEN-001). 
-  Single-dose toxicity study (DEN-001) 
In  a  non-GLP  pilot  toxicology  study,  toxicity  of  a  single 
subcutaneous  (SC)  dose  of  TDV  was  compared  with  that  of 
wild  type  DENV-2  virus,  vehicle  control  (vaccine  diluent  FTA 
containing 1% F-127, 15% trehalose, and 0.1% human serum 
albumin) or saline placebo. No effect on weight or appearance 
was  observed  in  mice  dosed  with  TDV,  while  mice  receiving 
DENV-2  had  weight  loss  and  poor  appearance.  Toxicological 
findings  for  both  DENV-2  and  TDV  included  a  generalized 
inflammatory response, reduction in alkaline phosphatase  and 
splenic  extramedullary  haematopoiesis.  An  increase  in  the 
number of platelets was observed on Days 7, 9, and 11 in the 
DENV-2  group,  and  on  Days  7  and  9  in  the  TDV  group. 
Adverse  findings  were  of  lesser  severity  and  shorter  duration 
in  TDV  treated  animals  compared  with  DENV-2-treated 
animals. Viremia was of lower magnitude and shorter duration 
in  TDV  treated  animals  compared  with  DENV-2-treated 
animals.  The  results  of  this  pilot  toxicology  study  supported 
use  of the AG129  mouse  model based on  susceptibility to the 
parental wild type DENV-2 16681 strain and TDV strains. 
-  Repeat-dose toxicity studies 
1/ DEN-004 
In a GLP study, repeated administration of TDV by SC injection 
was well tolerated at a target dose (sum of all 4 components) 
of  5.5  log10  PFU/dose  (actual  minimal  dose  administered 
5.9 log10  PFU  per  back  titration)  in  AG129  mice.  Mice  were 
administered  TDV  up  to  three  occasions  on  Days  1,  31,  and 
46. Study animals were then observed after dosing to evaluate 
the  potential  toxicity  of  TDV  until  scheduled  necropsy  on  day

platelets  were  observed  in  the  TDV  group  throughout  the 
study.  No  treatment-related  or  toxicologically  significant 
findings  on  any  coagulation  parameters  were  observed 
throughout  the  study.  Mixed  cell  infiltrates  persisted  at  the 
injection site through study Days 53 and 61 but were deemed 
related  to  the  vaccine  diluent  at  these  later  time  points. 
Administration  of  the  first  dose  of  TDV  did  not  result  in 
enhanced  infectivity  of  subsequent  doses  of  the  vaccine 
viruses. 
In  contrast,  injection  with  wild  type  DENV-2  resulted  in  a 
rough  fur  coat  and  organ  weight  changes  at  necropsy  in 
addition  to  histopathology  and  hematology  observations 
associated with a more severe generalized inflammatory state. 
Injection with wild type DENV-2 resulted in histologic evidence 
of  dengue  virus-associated  encephalitis.  The  observations  of 
this  GLP  toxicology  study  supported  the  findings  of  the  pilot 
toxicology  study 
in  supporting  tolerability  of  TDV  and 
immunogenicity against all 4 DENV serotypes.

-  Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity 
The objective of this study was to assess the potential toxicity 
of TDV on fertility, development of the embryo and fetus, and 
postnatal  development  in  New  Zealand  White  rabbits.  This 
study  was  designed  to  evaluate  International  Conference  on 
Harmonisation  (ICH)  Harmonised  Tripartite  Guideline  S5 
stages A to E of the reproductive process. 
F0  generation  female  rabbits  in  Groups  1  and  2  were  given 
2 dose  administrations  per  day  (once  every  3  weeks)  of  TDV 
(containing  5.4  log  PFU/mL;  TDV-2:  4.8  log  PFU/mL;  TDV-3: 
5.7  log  PFU/mL;  TDV-4:  6.2  log  PFU/mL)  or  saline  control 
article prior to mating on Days 1, 21 and 42 of study, and on 
Days  7  and  28  of  gestation  (GDs  7  and  28).  The  first  day  of 
dosing was considered Day 1 of study (DS 1). 
food  consumption,  and  mating, 
Administration of TDV on study DS 1, 21 and 42 and GD 7 and 
28  did  not  increase  the  incidence  of  clinical  signs,  dermal 
scoring,  or  maternal  gross  lesions  or  have  an  effect  on  body 
weights, 
fertility,  or 
reproduction in the F0 generation, as compared with the group 
administered  the  saline  control  article.  There  were  no  TDV-
related  mortalities.  In  addition,  there  were  no  effects  on  any 
ovarian,  uterine,  or  litter  parameters  following  administration 
of TDV. 
Maternal treatment with TDV did not cause any vaccine-related 
effects  on  clinical  observations,  body  weights,  organ  weights, 
or  gross  pathology  observations  in  the  F1  generation  kits. 
There  were  no  TDV-related  mortalities.  There  were  no  fetal 
gross external, soft tissue, or skeletal abnormalities attributed 
to administration of the vaccine. 
TDV elicited an immune response in 100% of the rabbits on DS 
48  prior  to  mating.  The  F1  generation  from  Group  2 
Caesarean-sectioned fetuses were 100% seropositive while the 
natural  delivery  kits  were  95%,  100%,  83%  and  93% 
seropositive to DENV-1, -2, -3 and -4, respectively. 
In summary, TDV  was well tolerated and did  not  produce  any 
detectable maternal or developmental toxicity in New Zealand 
White rabbits.

- Neurovirulence (DEN-014) 
As  a  part  of  the  characterization  of  the  attenuation  of  TDV

was well tolerated (mortality, clinical signs, body weights, food 
findings,  organ  weights,  and 
consumption,  macroscopic 
microscopic  findings)  and  no  adverse  effects  related  to  TDV 
administration  were  observed.  On  Day  2,  viral  RNA  (vRNA) 
from the four TDV serotypes was detected at low levels at the 
injection  site.  By  Day  6,  vRNA  was  distributed  broadly,  and 
was  detectable  in  most  tissues.  By  Day  14,  vRNA  had  been 
reduced  to  below  the  level  of  detection  in  most  tissues, 
including  serum.  By  Day  42,  most  tissues  were  negative  for 
vRNA, but low levels of TDV-2 vRNA were detected in one skin 
sample  from  the  injection  site,  one  thymus  sample,  and  one 
brain  sample.  There  were  no  TDV-associated  clinical 
observations  or  histopathological  findings  in  the  brain  or 
thymus  at  any  timepoint,  or  in  the  injection  site  on  Day  42, 
including 
in  those  animals  with  detectable  vRNA.  One 
mandibular  lymph  node  was  positive  for  TDV-3  vRNA  on  Day 
42  and  minimal  increased  lymphoid  cellularity  was  present  in 
the mandibular lymph node in a few animals, including the one 
animal with detectable vRNA. 
With  these  data  in  mind,  the  potential  mechanism  of  vRNA 
distributing  to  brain  of  AG129  mice,  and  potential  risk 
associated  with  this  finding,  was  investigated.  Review  of  all 
nonclinical  studies  of  TDV  in  AG129  mice  showed  no  TDV-
related neurological manifestations. TDV  was demonstrated to 
be less neurovirulent than wild-type DENV-2 in newborn mice. 
Both DENV-2 16681 (the  wild-type parental strain of PDK-53) 
and DENV-2 PDK-53 (the attenuated parental strain of TDV-2) 
were  reported  to  have  little  or  no  neurovirulence  in  immune-
competent  rhesus  macaques  when  injected  into  the  brain  or 
spinal cord, and no clinical signs were observed. It may be that 
the  immunocompromised  AG129  mouse  model  chosen  for 
biodistribution  and  shedding  assessment  may  be  sensitive  to 
distribution  or  persistence  of  vRNA  in  brain  due  to  lack  of 
interferon responses and increased vascular permeability. 
Overall,  in  a  single  dose  TDV  nonclinical  biodistribution  and 
shedding study in AG129 mice, the maximal detection of vRNA 
in  serum  was  observed  on  Day  6  and  clearance  from  the 
majority  of  samples  was  noted  by  Day  42.  TDV  was  well 
tolerated, and there was no measurable level of vRNA in feces 
and  urine,  and  a  low  level  of  vRNA  detected  in  saliva  of  one 
animal  early  in  the  study  (Day  6),  confirming  a  low  risk  for 
vaccine  shedding  to  the  environment  or  transmission  from 
vaccinees.

-  Dengue Antibody-dependent disease enhancement (ADE) 
Nonclinical  studies  to  evaluate  (ADE)  were  not  performed 
because nonclinical models are not highly predictive of the risk 
of severe dengue disease in humans. The available models use 
either  immunocompromised  animals,  or  if  immunocompetent 
the  animals  are  not  susceptible  to  symptomatic  dengue 
disease. 
Takeda  has  compiled  supportive 
immunological  data  that  confirms 
a  broad,  multicomponent  immune 
response  is  generated  by  TDV, 
which  indicates  that  the  risk  for 
ADE  is  less  than  that  found  in 
waning  monovalent  infections,  or 
from  vaccination with formulations 
that are unable to activate multiple 
layers  of  protection  (e.g.,  dengue

all  4  serotypes  in  addition  to  that 
afforded by antibodies).

Part II: Module SIV - Populations not studied in clinical 
trials  
SIV.1. Exclusion criteria in pivotal clinical studies within the development 
programme 
Females subjects (post-menarche) who were pregnant or breastfeeding. 
Females of childbearing potential, who are sexually active, and who have not used any of 
the  acceptable  contraceptive  methods  for  at  least  2  months  prior  to  study  entry  or  who 
refuse to use an acceptable contraceptive method or avoid donation of ova up to 6 weeks 
post second vaccination. 
Reason for exclusion 
These subjects were excluded to ensure vaccinee and fetus safety. 
Most  live  attenuated  vaccines  are  not  recommended  or  contraindicated 
during  pregnancy  as 
live  attenuated  virus  vaccines 
administered  to  pregnant  women  might,  be  capable  of  crossing  the 
placenta and infecting the foetus [110]. 
theoretically, 
There  are  conflicting  data  in  the  literature  regarding  the  association 
between  wild  type  dengue  infection  during  pregnancy  and  increased  risks 
of both a more severe course of disease and adverse pregnancy outcomes 
[111-113]. 
Pre-clinical  data  for  TDV  were  not  available  when  most  of  the  studies 
started  (including  the  pivotal  Trial  DEN-301).  Moreover,  it  was  unknown 
whether  TDV  was  excreted  in  human  milk  and  data  on  excretion  of  wild 
type dengue via breastfeeding are limited.

Not  applicable.  Safety  profile  of  inadvertent  use  in  pregnant  or  lactating 
women is included as missing information. 
History of hypersensitivity or allergy to any of the vaccine components. 
Reason for exclusion 
These subjects were excluded to ensure vaccinee safety. 
Is  it  considered  to  be 
included  as  missing 
information? 
No  
Rationale 
There  was  no  evidence  TDV  was  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of 
serious  anaphylactic  shock  or  hypersensitivity  events.  However,  subjects 
who  are  allergic  to  any  vaccine  component  are  at  risk  to  develop 
anaphylactic  reactions.  Anaphylaxis 
is 
classified as an  important  potential risk. Moreover,  hypersensitivity to the 
active  substances  or  to  any  of  the  excipients  of  the  vaccine  or  to  a 
previous  dose  of  TDV  are  listed  as  contraindications  for  TDV  in  the

Reason for exclusion 
These  subjects  were  excluded  to  avoid  confounding  the  assessment  of 
emerging immune response and safety profile of TDV. 
Based on general vaccination guidelines, intervals of 2 or 4 weeks between 
administration  with  inactivated  or  live  vaccines,  respectively,  should  be 
respected to avoid interactions with other vaccines.

Receipt  of  blood  products  and/or  immunoglobulins  within  the  6  months  before  study 
entry. 
Reason for exclusion 
These subjects were excluded to avoid confounding the assessment of TDV 
immunogenicity  in  the  study  population  as  live-attenuated  viruses 
contained  in  TDV  may  be  neutralized  by  circulating  antibodies  in 
immunoglobulin therapy or blood products (such as blood or plasma). 
Is  it  considered  to  be 
included  as  missing 
information? 
No 
Rationale 
As per general vaccination guidelines, for patients receiving treatment with 
immunoglobulins  or  blood  products  containing  immunoglobulins,  it  is 
recommended to defer the administration of live attenuated viral vaccines 
for at least 6 weeks and preferably for 3 months, following the end of the 
treatment before administering TDV, in order to avoid neutralization of the 
attenuated viruses contained in the vaccine. This information is mentioned 
in the SmPC Section 4.5 and PL Section 2. 
Febrile illness (temperature ≥38°C) or moderate or severe acute illness or infection at the 
time of randomization. 
Reason for exclusion 
These subjects were excluded to ensure vaccinee safety and not confound 
the assessment of emerging immunogenicity and safety profile of TDV.  
Is  it  considered  to  be 
included  as  missing 
information? 
No 
Rationale 
As per established vaccination guidelines, administration of vaccines must 
be  postponed  in  individuals  who  present  febrile  illness  or  moderate  to 
severe acute disease. 
SIV.2. Limitations to detect adverse reactions in clinical trial development 
programmes 
Overall,  data  from  27,573  subjects,  from  18  ongoing  or  completed  trials,  as  of  the  overall  safety 
data cut-off date, contributed to the safety evaluation of TDV (20,071 subjects from the pivotal Trial 
DEN-301). These trials covered an age range from 1.5 to 60 years and safety surveillance up to 36 
months after the second dose of trial vaccine in Trial DEN-301. Overall, 19,980 subjects received at 
least 1 dose of TDV in these trials. Among all 19,980 subjects exposed to any TDV, 18,145 subjects 
(90.8%) received at least 1 SC dose of TDV. 
The  clinical  development  program  is  likely  to  provide  data  concerning  serious  rare  adverse  events 
due to size of population and address long-term risks as the planned follow-up period covers up to 
4.5 years after the last TDV injection. Moreover, available follow-up  data are  3  years after  second 
TDV injection for DEN-301 and 4 years after first TDV injection for DEN-204.

Children (<4 years) 
The  overall  clinical  development  of  TDV  comprised  a  population  aged 
1.5 to 60 years; TDV is indicated for the prevention of dengue disease in 
individuals from 4 years of age. 
Number of subjects aged <4 years in the clinical development program: 
- 401 subjects from phase 2 Trial DEN-204 
- 54 subjects from phase 2 Trial DEN-203 
The  evaluation  of  the  safety  profile  of  TDV  in  children  aged  <4  years  is 
limited  to  401  subjects  aged  2  to  3  years  from  phase  2  Trial  DEN-204, 
comprising  354  subjects  exposed  to  TDV  and  47  subjects  exposed  to 
placebo  only.  The  401  children  aged  <4  years  from  Trial  DEN-204  were 
followed  up  until  48  months  after  the  first  vaccine  dose.  All  subjects  in 
Trial DEN-204 were enrolled in dengue-endemic countries: The Philippines, 
Dominican Republic and Panama (Refer to CTD Module 2.7.4). 
The 54 subjects aged <4 years from  Trial DEN-203, comprise 37 subjects 
exposed  to  HD TDV  and  17 subjects  exposed  to  placebo  (none  received 
the final TDV formulation) (Refer to CTD Module 2.7.4). 
For children aged <4 years (not part of the proposed age indication), the 
evaluation  of  the  long-term  safety  data  of  the  401 subjects  from  Trial 
DEN-204 up to 48 months after the first vaccine dose did not identify any 
important safety risks.

Part  II:  Module  SVI  -  Additional  EU  requirements  for  the 
safety specification 
Potential for misuse for illegal purposes 
There is no indication that TDV has potential to be a medicinal product of abuse. 
TDV is indicated for the prevention of dengue disease in individuals from 4 years of age and there is 
no known illegal marketplace. In summary, it is highly unlikely that TDV will be misused for illegal 
purposes.  
Potential for overdose 
TDV is administered by a healthcare professional and using single-dose vials. Therefore, overdosing 
is not anticipated. No cases of overdose have been reported in clinical trials with TDV. 
Potential for transmission of infectious agents 
Transmission of the vaccine viruses to susceptible people or other organisms 
A  range  of  organisms  may  be  exposed  directly  or  indirectly  to  TDV.  Vaccinated  individuals  are 
intentionally  exposed.  Clinical  staff  administering  the  vaccine  or  other  staff  handling  the  vaccine 
during transport may be unintentionally exposed through a spill or needle stick. During the course of 
the  release,  access  to  the  dengue  vaccine  will  be  limited  to  pharmacy  staff,  medical  practitioners 
and  health  care  professionals.  Therefore,  there  is  very  little  potential  for  unintended  exposure  to 
TDV.  Standard  blood  donation  screening  practices  would  prevent  vaccine  recipients  from  donating 
blood during their expected periods of viremia. However, wild type dengue infections resulting from 
needle stick injuries during the care of febrile patients have been reported  [114,115]. In the worst 
case,  a  needle  stick  or  other  unintended  exposure  to  TDV  would  be  expected  to  result  in  the 
symptoms seen during intentional vaccination. 
Waste  management  workers,  insects,  birds  and  animals  may  be  unintentionally  exposed  through 
inadvertent  disposal  of  unused  vaccine  to  landfill.  But  due  to  the  instability  of  dengue  viruses  and 
the vaccine in the environment, there is little risk of waste management workers, insects, birds and 
animals  being  unintentionally  exposed  to  infectious  vaccine  waste  through  inadvertent  disposal  of 
unused vaccine. 
Theoretically accidental exposure could also occur if a mosquito feeds on a vaccinated subject during 
a  period  of  high  TDV  replication.  TDV  uptake  by  the  mosquito  and  subsequent  biting  of  another 
person could transmit TDV unintentionally. Takeda has conducted studies in mosquitoes to evaluate 
the potential of TDV to be transmitted by these vectors. Dengue virus transmission occurs through 
the  bite  of  an  infected  mosquito  vector.  TDV  monovalent  vaccine  strains  were  shown  to  have  a 
reduced ability to replicate and disseminate in Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes [116]. 
Environmental  escape  of  TDV  by  mosquito  transmission  could  only  occur  if  (i)  a  mosquito  vector 
feeds  on  a  vaccinee  with  a  sufficient  viremia  titer  to  infect  the  mosquito  midgut,  (ii)  the  virus  is 
capable  of  replicating  in  the  midgut  epithelium,  (iii)  replicated  virus  is  able  to  subsequently 
disseminate out of the midgut, and (iv) the disseminated virus can replicate in the mosquito salivary 
gland and release sufficient virus in saliva for transmission. In the Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials, TDV 
(mostly TDV-2) replicated in only a portion of the subjects and, the vaccine viral RNA levels were 1 
to  2  logs  lower  than  the  wild  type  dengue  MID50  for  both  Aedes  aegypti  and  Aedes  albopictus 
mosquitoes  [117,118].  With  the  very  low  mosquito  infection,  dissemination  and  transmission 
capacity  of  TDV  in  Aedes  aegypti  and  Aedes  albopictus  and  the  low  levels  of  TDV  viremia  seen  in 
vaccinees, it is highly unlikely that the vaccine viruses would be transmitted by mosquitoes through 
the  natural  infection  route.  In  addition,  TDV  has  an  attenuated  phenotype  for  replication  in  C6/36 
Aedes  albopictus  mosquito  cells.  Although  very  unlikely  given  the  above  considerations,  it  is 
expected that  TDV transmission from  an  infected mosquito’s bite would at worst result in the mild 
symptoms seen during intentional vaccination.

Version 1.0 
The  TDV  viruses  have  been  shown  to  be  attenuated  in  humans,  non-human  primates  and  mice 
[119,120].  In  the  worst  case,  unintended  exposure  to  TDV  is  expected  to  result  in  the  same 
response as intentional inoculation with the vaccine. 
Shedding 
Dengue viruses are transmitted in blood and are not known to spread to other people by shedding 
[10,121].  Although  dengue  virus  RNA  and  NS1  protein  have  been  found  in  the  urine  and  saliva  in 
wild  type  infections  of  humans,  live  dengue  viruses  have  not  been  isolated  [121,122]. In  a  study, 
dengue virus has not been detected in the semen in five patients with acute dengue virus infection 
[123]. Cases of likely sexual transmission and cases of presence of dengue virus in semen or vaginal 
secretions have been reported but are considered anecdotal [124-126]. There is limited data on the 
excretion of wild type dengue via breast  milk.  In  a small study, DENV was detected in breast milk 
samples from 9 (75%) of 12 infected breastfeeding mothers [127]. 
Like  other  flaviviruses,  dengue  virus,  has  low  environmental  stability.  Thus,  if  TDV  would  be  shed 
into the environment, it would likely be unstable. In a single dose TDV nonclinical biodistribution and 
shedding  study  in  AG129  mice  (Study  5002340),  there  was  no  shedding  of  TDV  RNA  in  feces  and 
urine.  These  results  suggest  a  low  risk  for  TDV  shedding  to  the  environment or  transmission  from 
vaccinees by shedding. 
Maternal-fetal transmission of the vaccine viruses 
In  studies  of  dengue  in  pregnancy,  where  maternal-fetal  transmission  of  wild  type  dengue  viruses 
has been demonstrated by the detection of dengue specific IgM in cord blood, rates of transmission 
were  low  [128,129]  (vertical  transmission  1.6%  and  5.6%  respectively).  In  addition,  cases  of 
dengue disease in neonates following transmission of the virus between an infected mother and the 
fetus in utero or as a result of transmission to her infant during labour and delivery, have also been 
reported  rarely  [128-132].  Intrauterine  transmission  of  dengue  has  been  associated  with  high 
maternal  serum  viremia  titers  [132]  and  may  be  related  to  endothelial  damage  and  increased 
vascular permeability caused by the wild type dengue virus infection  [122]. TDV is attenuated and 
replication of the vaccine virus is limited relative to wild type dengue viruses. 
Pregnant women were not included in the clinical development program (See  Part II: Module SIV - 
Populations not studied in clinical trials) and therefore there is limited amount of data from the use 
of  TDV  in  pregnant  women.  These  data  are  not  sufficient  to  conclude  on  the  absence  of  potential 
effects of TDV on pregnancy, embryo-fetal development, parturition and post-natal development. A 
study  in  rabbits  did  not  indicate  direct  or  indirect  harmful  effects  with  respect  to  reproductive 
toxicity. 
Although, live attenuated virus vaccines given to pregnant women might be capable of crossing the 
placenta  and  infecting  the  fetus,  no  evidence  of  increased  adverse  pregnancy  outcomes  has  been 
identified  from  inadvertent  immunisation  of  women  in  early  pregnancy  with  the  first  marketed 
dengue vaccine at this time [133]. 
Potential  for 
in  the 
manufacturing  process  as  well  as  contaminations  introduced  by  the  manufacturing 
process 
infections  caused  by  residuals  of  biological  material  used 
The four TDV viruses are purified. The purified active substance is stabilized in a solution containing 
various salts, Poloxamer 407, Trehalose, and human serum albumin. Both TDV presentations, vial - 
vial  presentation  or  vial  -  prefilled  syringe,  are  sterile.  Therefore,  no  potential  infectious 
contaminants from the manufacturing process are expected. 
Reversion to virulence 
Vaccine viremia and potential reversions in the presence of replication-competent vaccine virus only 
were assessed in several Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials conducted in endemic and non-endemic 
areas (DEN-101, DEN-102, DEN-103, DEN-104, and DEN-203 Part 1). Furthermore, vaccine viremia 
CONFIDENTIAL 
 
Dengue Tetravalent Vaccine (Live, Attenuated) 
Risk Management Plan / 11-October-2022  
Page 35 of 102 
Version 1.0 
and  potential  reversions  independent  of  the  presence  of  replication-competent  vaccine  virus  was 
determined  in  DEN-205.  The  proportion  of  subjects  with  vaccine  viremia  varied  from  one  trial  to 
another likely because of the different trial settings and the different earlier TDV formulations with 
different viral content. In the TDV group of Trial DEN-205, vaccine viremia was observed in 30.9% 
of subjects and occurred mainly after the first dose and peaked 10 to 12 days after vaccination. In 
the vast majority of cases, vaccine viremia occurred for vaccine strain TDV-2. 
In  total,  423/775  (54.6%)  of  subjects  exposed  to  TDV  had  detectable  vaccine  strain  RNA. 
Reversions were detected in 67 subjects; all affected only a single attenuation locus. This included 
23  reversions  detected  in  Trial  DEN-205  for  which  the  presence  of  replication  competent  material 
was  not determined, and  44 reversions detected  in Trials  DEN-101,  DEN-102,  DEN-103,  DEN-104, 
and DEN-203 Part 1. The majority of reversions (n=65) were found in the 5’NCR locus, two affected 
the  NS1  locus  (a  single  partial  reversion  in  subject  from  Trial  DEN-104  and  a  single  reversion  in 
subject from HD TDV group of Trial DEN-205)) and none were found for the NS3 locus. 
Apart from a numerical increase and temporal association of mostly mild and transient solicited and 
unsolicited AEs, no major safety findings were identified for subjects with vaccine viremia. Subjects 
with vaccine viremia may develop systemic symptoms such as headache, arthralgia, or myalgia that 
can also occur in  the absence  of viremia,  illustrating  the  non-specific nature  of  such events.  While 
rashes were rather infrequent (up to 10.2% in vaccine recipients), their occurrence showed a close 
temporal relationship with viremia. 
The  AE  profile  in  the  67  subjects  with  reversions  was  not  indicative  of  an  increased  severity  of 
symptoms.  The  2  reversions  observed  in  the  NS1  locus  (partial  reversion  in  subject  from  Trial 
DEN-104,  second  reversion  in  subject  from  the  HD  TDV  group  of  Trial  DEN-205)  did  not  result  in 
increased virulence: the subject from Trial DEN-104 reported fatigue, rash, and headache (all non-
serious and graded as mild) and no fever; the second subject from Trial DEN-205 did not report any 
AEs (refer to CTD Module 2.7.4). 
In the pivotal efficacy Trial DEN-301, reversions were determined in subjects who reported a febrile 
illness  starting  within  30  days  of  vaccination  and  who  had  replication  competent  vaccine  virus 
detected.  Single  reversions  (all  in  the  5’NCR  locus)  were  identified  in  4  out  of  15  subjects  with 
replication-competent  vaccine  viremia.  All  four  subjects  reported  headache;  two  experienced  in 
addition rash and vomiting. One of the subjects was hospitalized due to dehydration; however, there 
was no evidence of bleeding, low platelet counts or plasma leakage in any of the affected subjects. 
Overall, no important safety risk was identified. 
The presence of two attenuation determinants is sufficient to maintain the attenuation phenotype of 
TDV. Thus, it is unlikely that reversion of only one of the three attenuation loci of TDV would yield 
more virulent viruses that persist for a long time and cause dengue disease [2]. 
Of note, reversion to virulence theoretically may occur by a mechanism other than mutation during 
replication: when two dengue viruses infect a single cell, it is theoretically possible for recombination 
to occur if the RNA polymerase switches between genomes during viral replication. Since all four of 
the  TDV  viruses  share  the  identical  attenuating  mutations,  recombination  between  vaccine  strains 
cannot generate more pathogenic viruses. However, recombination with wild type dengue viruses is 
theoretically  possible  in  TDV  recipients  if  that  person  Recombination  between  two  DENV  genomes 
has been observed, though at a lower frequency than with other RNA viruses such as poliovirus and 
human immunodeficiency virus. In these studies, there was no evidence of recombination leading to 
viruses with greater pathogenicity. The life cycle of DENV requires propagation in both humans and 
mosquitoes,  which  may  restrict  the  virus’  ability  to  mutate  [134].  Thus,  the  genome  tends  to  be 
relatively fixed [135-138]. As the attenuated parental virus DENV-2 PDK-53 does not exist in nature, 
there  are  no  studies  of  natural  recombination  with  wild  type  DENV-2  viruses  available.  However, 
recombination would require co-infection of the same cell with 2 DENVs. The attenuated phenotype 
DENV-2 PDK53 results in less replication, reducing the opportunities for co-infection and therefore of 
recombination.  Even  if  recombination  theoretically  occurred,  the  resulting  virus  would  likely  be 
attenuated (Refer to CTD Module 1.6.2).

Potential for immunisation errors 
During  the  clinical  trial  development  of  TDV,  no  systematic  immunisation  errors  were  found  that 
would  indicate misinterpretation  of  the  product  labelling/handling instructions. However, the ability 
to predict post authorization immunisation errors from experience during the clinical phase is limited 
and an effect on the safety and/or immunogenicity of TDV cannot be excluded. In order to minimise 
immunisation errors in the post-marketing setting, the specific handling, storage and administration 
requirements are described in the SmPC Section 6.4 Special precautions for storage and Section 6.6 
Special  precautions  for  disposal  and  other  handling  and  have  been  taken  into  account  during 
packaging design. 
The potential sources of immunisation errors with TDV are related to the following elements: 
1. TDV must be stored at +2 to +8°C and not frozen. 
Drug product stability data indicate that the lyophilized drug product will remain within the potency 
specification  for  at  least  18  months  when  stored  at  +2  to  +8°C,  depending  on  the  target  starting 
potency titer used to manufacture a given lot (refer to SmPC Section 6.3). 
After  reconstitution  with  the  solvent  provided,  in  general,  Qdenga  should  be  used  immediately.  If 
not used immediately the reconstituted vaccine must be used within 2 hours (refer to SmPC Section 
6.3). 
Safety concerns relating to inappropriate storage are theoretical at this point in time. 
The SmPC (Sections 6.3 and 6.4) includes the recommendations to store the vaccine. 
2. The vaccine is a lyophilized product that needs to be reconstituted in the appropriate solvent 
prior to administration. 
Potential errors include use of the wrong solvent, wrong volume of solvent, administration of solvent 
alone (without reconstituted vaccine), prolonged storage of reconstituted product before vaccination 
or not injecting all 0.5 mL of the reconstituted vaccine. All specific requirements are described in the 
instructions for reconstitution (refer to SmPC Section 6.6). 
3. TDV  is  indicated  for  subcutaneous  administration  in  the  deltoid  region  as  two  doses,  three 
months apart. 
The  SmPC  Section  4.2  includes  the  recommendations  to  carry  out  the  administration  correctly 
(Method of administration). 
4. Syringes and needles. 
The application will include 2 presentations: 
•  Vial/vial presentation: Vial containing lyophilized vaccine packed with vial containing solvent; 
no syringe/needles in the pack 
•  Vial/pre-filled  syringe  presentation:  Vial  containing  lyophilized  vaccine  packed  with  pre-filled 
syringe  containing  solvent;  with  or  without  2  separate  needles  in  the  pack,  but  none 
attached to the syringe 
The SmPC Section 6.6 includes the recommendations to carry out the administration correctly. 
5. Use of expired vaccine or solvent. 
The vaccine should not be used after the expiry date which is stated on the carton. 
6. Confusion with another licensed dengue vaccine (i.e. Dengvaxia®) in countries where both 
vaccines are licensed which may result in incomplete or wrong vaccination schedules.

There  are  no  data  available  on  interchangeability  of  the  two  vaccines  and  whether  the  immune 
response may be impacted. In addition, the separate labelling for each product provides instructions 
on correct usage. 
As recommended by the WHO, errors in immunisation will be considered in the initial evaluation of 
all  adverse  event  following  immunisation  (AEFI)  [139].  Correct  usage  will  be  monitored  within 
routine  pharmacovigilance  activities  and  any  changes  in  the  safety  profile  of  TDV  related  to 
immunisation  errors  will  be  followed  via  periodic  safety  update  reports/periodic  benefit-risk 
evaluation report (PSURs/PBRERs). 
Specific paediatric issues identified in paediatric investigation plans (PIP) 
In  the  current  PIP  Opinion/EMA  Decision  for  TDV  (EMA  decision  dated  30-Oct-2020),  the  following 
potential  long-term  safety/efficacy  issues  were  identified  as  particular  causes  of  concern  in  the 
paediatric population for consideration in the Risk Management Plan/Pharmacovigilance activities: 
•  Potential Antibody-dependent Disease Enhancement (ADE) in subjects not yet immune to all four 
serotypes. 
•  Possible interaction between the vaccine and other flavivirus vaccines 
•  Any possible enhancement of severity of other flavivirus diseases. 
Assessment of potential ADE in subjects not yet immune to all four serotypes: 
The totality of data on virologically confirmed dengue (VCD), hospitalized VCD, and severe forms of 
dengue, along with the clinical characteristics of these cases, as assessed in Trials  DEN-301, DEN-
313,  and  DEN-204,  did  not  reveal  an  identified  risk  of  increased  disease  severity  or  disease 
enhancement  attributable  to  vaccination  in  the  post-vaccination  follow-up  period.  In  baseline 
seronegative  subjects,  an  increased  risk  of  hospitalization  due  to  dengue  and/or  clinically  severe 
forms  of  dengue  caused  by  DENV-3  and  DENV-4  is  considered  an  important  potential  safety  risk. 
This potential risk is under continued monitoring and safety evaluation, based on the ongoing long-
term follow-up in Trial DEN-301. (Refer to CTD Module 2.5 and Module 2.7.4). 
Assessment of possible interaction between the vaccine and other flavivirus vaccines:  
Co-administration  of  TDV  with  yellow  fever  (YF)  and  Hepatitis  A  virus  (HAV)  vaccines  has  been 
evaluated in two phase 3 trials, DEN-305 and DEN-314. In both trials, the co-administration of TDV 
with YF or HAV vaccines was generally well tolerated and had no negative effect on the safety and 
reactogenicity of either vaccine. The trials revealed no identified or potential safety risks in case of 
co-administration.  YF  vaccine  immunogenicity  was  not  affected  when  administered  concomitantly 
with  TDV.  However,  dengue  antibody  responses  were  decreased  to  some  extent  following 
concomitant  administration  of  TDV  with  the  YF  vaccine  compared  with  separately  administered 
vaccines,  with  non-inferiority  shown  for  DENV-2,  DENV-3,  and  DENV-4,  but  not  for  DENV-1.  The 
clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Co-administration of the HAV vaccine with TDV has no 
negative impact  on the  immune response  to either vaccine. The effect of co-administration of  TDV 
with other vaccines currently remains unknown. (Refer to CTD Module 2.5). 
Assessment of any possible enhancement of severity of other flavivirus diseases: 
Overall, the data from the TDV clinical development program do not suggest an increased risk for a 
possible enhancement in severity of non-dengue flavivirus infections following TDV vaccination.

There  were  no  TDV-related  anaphylactic  reactions  or  anaphylactic

However,  anaphylaxis  is  a  severe  and  potentially  fatal  systemic 
reaction which has been reported for most vaccines [140].  
Vaccines  are  not  anticipated  to  be  100%  efficacious.  In  addition, 
most  vaccines  are  not  anticipated  to  provide  lifelong  immunity. 
Vaccine  effectiveness  may  wane  with  increasing  time  since 
vaccination.  Waning  immunity  may  lead  to  a  risk  for  wild  type

The  evaluation  of  the  VE  against  VCD  caused  by  DENV-4  in

Safety profile of inadvertent 
use in pregnant or lactating 
women 
Theoretically  the  live  attenuated  virus  in  the  vaccine  could  cross 
the  placenta  and  result  in  viral  infection  of  the  foetus.  Owing  to 
this  concern,  most 
live  attenuated  vaccines  are  either 
contraindicated or not recommended during pregnancy.

Safety and immunogenicity of 
concomitant administration

HAV and YF 
Safety and reactogenicity of a 
booster dose 
There  is  limited  amount  of  data  from  the  use  of  TDV  in  pregnant 
women.  These  data  are  not  sufficient  to  conclude  on  the  absence 
of  potential  effects  of  TDV  on  pregnancy,  embryo-foetal 
development, parturition and post-natal development. 
It is not known whether TDV is excreted in human milk. 
Immunocompromised  individuals  may  not  respond  adequately  to 
vaccination and potentially the live attenuated virus in the vaccine 
may  become  pathogenic.  Therefore,  as  per  guidelines  on 
vaccination,  live-attenuated  virus  vaccines  are  not  recommended 
for use in severely immunocompromised individuals. The safety of 
TDV in immunocompromised individuals is not known as they were 
excluded from the clinical development program. 
Potential interactions between concomitantly administered vaccines 
may compromise the effectiveness and/or safety. 
A protective immune response with TDV may decline over time. It 
is currently unknown whether a lack of protection could result in an 
increased severity of dengue. The effect of a booster dose is being 
investigated in 2 ongoing clinical trials (DEN-301 and DEN-303).

SVII.3. Details of important identified risks, important potential risks, 
and missing information 
SVII.3.1. Presentation of important identified risks and important potential risks 
Important Potential Risk: Anaphylaxis including anaphylactic shock 
Potential mechanisms: 
Anaphylaxis  is  a  Type  1  immediate  hypersensitivity  reaction  (Geland 
Coombs  classification)  mediated  by  the  interaction  of  IgE  antibodies 
against  a  particular  vaccine  component.  Therefore,  previous  exposure 
and sensitization to the triggering substance or a cross reactive allergen 
is  necessary.  When  a  vaccine  component  (allergen)  binds  to  the  IgE 
receptors on the surface of mast cells and basophils this results in cellular 
activation  and  release  of  preformed  mediators  such  as  histamine  and 
tryptase that elicit the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis [141]. 
Evidence  source(s)  and 
strength of evidence: 
Case descriptions of anaphylaxis for other vaccines exist in the literature 
[140]. 
Characterisation  of  the 
risk: 
TDV  contains  human  serum  albumin  which  has  been  associated  with 
urticarial hypersensitivity reactions to rabies vaccine [142, 143]. Persons 
with  prior  allergic  reactions  to  albumin  containing  products  may  be  at 
higher  risk  of  an  allergic  reaction  to  TDV.  No  published  evidence  for  a 
potential  hypersensitivity  potential  of  other  constituents  of  TDV  was 
identified. 
Anaphylaxis is an acute hypersensitivity reaction with multi-organ-system 
involvement  (≥2)  that  can  present  as,  or  rapidly  progress  to,  a  severe 
life-threatening reaction. It may occur following exposure to the different 
components  of  the  vaccine.  Anaphylactic  shock  is  the  most  severe 
manifestation of anaphylaxis [141]. 
Anaphylaxis  after  vaccination  in  general  occurs  very  rarely  but  is  a 
potentially  life-threatening  medical  emergency  [144-148].  It  has  been 
estimated to occur  at  a  rate  of  approximately  one  to  ten  per 1,000,000 
doses  for  most  commonly  administered  vaccines  [149-151].  The  true 
rate  of  allergic  reactions  is  unknown  because  most  reactions  are  not 
reported [152]. 
No  cases  of  anaphylaxis  have  been  observed  in  the  TDV  pre-clinical 
development program. There were no TDV-related anaphylactic reactions 
or  anaphylactic  shock  events  reported  during  the  clinical  development 
program.  TDV  was  not  associated  with  an  increased  risk  for  serious 
anaphylactic shock or severe hypersensitivity events. 
factors  and  risk 
Risk 
groups: 
Clinical  risk  factors  that  have  been  identified  for  anaphylaxis  are  [153-
155]: 
- History  of  allergies  to  the  active  substances  or  any  of  the  other 
components of the TDV vaccine. 
- History of an allergic reaction after a previous immunisation with TDV. 
- Coexisting atopic disease, particularly asthma. 
However,  allergic  reactions  may  occur  in  patients  without  known  risk 
factors [156].

Version 1.0 
Preventability: 
Predictability/prevention for new onset anaphylaxis is not possible due to 
it being idiosyncratic. 
The  best  practice  to  prevent  anaphylactic  reactions  is  to  identify  at-risk 
individuals  by  obtaining  the  history  of  severe  allergic  reactions  to  any 
component of the vaccine or to previous vaccinations that might indicate 
an underlying hypersensitivity and avoid their vaccination.[157] 
The  SmPC  Section  4.3  contains 
following  contraindication: 
“Hypersensitivity  to  the  active  substances  or  to  any  of  the  excipients 
listed in Section 6.1. or hypersensitivity to a previous dose of Qdenga”. 
the 
As per general recommendations on immunisation, individuals should be 
observed  after  vaccination  and  appropriate  medical  treatment  of 
anaphylaxis  should  always  be  readily  available.  Early  recognition  of 
symptoms and intervention can minimise the reaction sequalae/severity. 
The  SmPC  Section  4.4  contains  the  following  Special  warnings  and 
precautions for use: “As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical 
treatment and supervision must always be readily available in the event 
of a rare anaphylactic reaction following administration of the vaccine.” 
A  severe  anaphylactic  reaction  can  be  life  threatening.  When  promptly 
treated, the prognosis is good. 
Currently,  18,273  doses  of  TDV  were  administered  with  no  anaphylactic 
reactions  to  TDV  reported.  This  potential  risk  is  not  expected  to  have  a 
serious impact on public health.

Public health impact: 
Important  Potential  Risk:  Dengue  disease  due  to  waning  protection  against  dengue  over 
time  
Potential mechanisms:   Waning  protection  against  dengue  over  time  may  leave  the  vaccinee 
susceptible  to  wild  type  dengue  infection,  a  potentially  life-threatening 
illness.  Waning  protection  also  may  render  vaccinees  at  risk  for  ADE  of 
infection. 
Evidence  source(s)  and 
strength of evidence: 
Efficacy  analyses  in  pivotal  Trial  DEN-301  demonstrated  the  Vaccine 
Efficacy  (VE)  of  TDV  in  the  primary  endpoint  of  preventing  VCD  fever 
caused by any dengue serotype from 30 days to 12 months post second 
vaccine  dose,  i.e.,  until  end  of  Part  1  (VE:  80.2%;  95%  CI:  73.3%, 
85.3%)  and  also  for  the  secondary  endpoint  period  from  30 days  to  18 
months post second vaccine dose (VE: 73.3%; 95% CI: 66.5%, 78.8%). 
VE was also seen for hospitalizations due to VCD by all dengue serotypes 
combined. From 30 days to 18 months post second vaccine dose, the VE 
for VCD leading to hospitalization was 90.4% (95% CI: 82.6%, 94.7%). 
From first dose to 4.5 years after second dose, the VE in preventing VCD 
fever  by  any  serotype  was  62.5%  (95%  CI:  56.0%,  65.8%)  and 
hospitalization  due  to  VCD  fever  caused  by  any  serotype  was  84.1% 
(95% CI: 77.8%, 88.6%). 
In  an  exploratory  analysis  at  54  months  post  second  dose  (end  of 
Part 3),  VE  in  preventing  VCD  was  shown  for  all  four  serotypes  in

baseline dengue seropositive subjects. In baseline seronegative subjects, 
VE  was  shown  for  DENV-1  and  DENV-2,  but  not  suggested  for  DENV-3 
and  could  not  be  shown  robustly  for  DENV-4  due  to  lower  incidence  of 
cases.  
VE  varied  in  exploratory  analysis  by  study  intervals:  during  the  third 
year,  although  some  decline  in  efficacy  compared  with  Year  2  was 
observed, largely driven  by  non-hospitalized  VCD  cases, efficacy  against 
VCD  was demonstrated  overall,  as well as in both baseline seronegative 
and seropositive subjects. Efficacy against VCD leading to hospitalization 
remained  robust  with  little  change  compared  with  Year  2.  The  data 
obtained  in  the  last  18  months  of  follow-up  following  Year  3  showed 
continued long-term protection against overall VCD and a sustained high 
level  of  protection  against  hospitalized  VCD  regardless  of  baseline 
serostatus.  
Waning immunity resulting in a loss of protection over time is applicable 
to  all  vaccines.  The  maximum  duration  of  protection  with  TDV  is  not 
known currently. 
In the Trial DEN-301, the exploratory year-by-year analysis of efficacy by 
serotype  and  serostatus,  TDV  efficacy  against  DENV-3  was  seen  in 
baseline  seropositive  subjects  in  Year  1,  Year  2  and  Year  3,  while  in 
baseline  seronegative  subjects,  the  efficacy  against  DENV-3  was  not 
suggested.  There  is  not  enough  data  to  make  an  assessment  against 
DENV-4 in baseline seronegative subjects. The relative risk of VCD (TDV 
versus  placebo,  irrespective  of  hospitalization)  caused  by  DENV-3  in 
baseline seronegative subjects up to 54 months after the second vaccine 
dose was close to 1 (1.11 [95% CI: 0.62, 1.99]). The relative risk of VCD 
caused by DENV-3  in baseline seronegative subjects declined over  time, 
with a relative risk point estimate of <1 during Year 3 (relative risk 0.91 
[95%  CI:  0.34,  2.45])  and  Year  4  (relative  risk  0  [95%  CI:  not 
estimable]);  no  VCD  caused  by  DENV-3  occurred  after  Year  4  up to  the 
end of Part 3. 
Over the years, a meaningful long-term protection was observed against 
VCD  despite  a  pattern  of  some  waning  driven  by  outpatient  cases. 
However,  protection  against  hospitalized  VCD  was  high  and  sustained. 
The  data  obtained  in  the  last  18  months  of  follow-up  up  to  Month  54 
showed  continued  long-term  protection  against  overall  VCD  and  a 
sustained high level of protection against  hospitalized  VCD  regardless of 
baseline serostatus.  
In  year-by-year  analysis  until  four  years  after  the  second  dose,  VE  in 
preventing  VCD  was  shown  for  all  four  serotypes  in  baseline  dengue 
seropositive  subjects.  In  baseline  seronegative  subjects,  VE  was  shown 
for DENV-1 and DENV-2, but not suggested for DENV-3 and could not be 
shown for DENV-4 due to lower incidence of cases. 
The long-term persistence of neutralising antibodies was shown in study 
DEN-301, with titers remaining  well  above the pre-vaccination  levels for 
all four serotypes, up to 51 months after the first dose. 
In  general,  lack  of  response  to  vaccination  can  occur  in  subjects  with 
immunodeficiency  (leading  to  suboptimal  or  even  absent  immune 
response),  elderly  age  and

chronic  disease  and  suboptimal  health  and  nutritional  status, 
immunological  interference  (e.g.,  administration  of  immunoglobulins,  or 
immunosuppressive  medications).  In  addition,  there  may  be  failure  to 
respond due to the normal expected variation in immune response across 
healthy individuals (i.e., a “low responder” or “non-responder) [159]. 
A comprehensive subgroup analysis showed efficacy across the evaluated 
subgroups by age group, region, country and prior vaccination against YF 
or  JE,  with  the  varying  magnitude  of  VE  per  subgroup  to  a  large  extent 
attributable  to  the  serotype  distribution  in  the  respective  subgroup.  No 
risk factors have been identified for TDV vaccination failure. 
In  general,  vaccine  effectiveness  may  wane  with  increasing  time  since 
vaccination. Depending on the vaccine, rates of decline may vary across 
antigens.  A  number  of  variables,  including  subject  age,  serostatus  at 
vaccination,  presence  or  absence  of  exposures  to  circulating  wild  type 
virus  (natural  boosting),  possible  evolution  of  the  wild  type  virus  away 
from  the  targets  of  vaccine  antigens,  as  well  as  unknown  factors, 
influence duration of vaccine protection. 
The  SmPC  includes  in  Section  4.4  the  following  Special  warning  and 
Precaution for use: “A protective immune response with Qdenga may not 
be elicited in all vaccinees against all serotypes of dengue virus and may 
decline  over  time  (see  Section  5.1).  It  is  currently  unknown  whether  a 
lack  of  protection  could  result  in  an  increased  severity  of  dengue.  It  is 
to  continue  personal  protection  measures  against 
recommended 
mosquito  bites  after  vaccination.  Individuals  should  seek  medical  care  if 
they  develop  dengue  symptoms  or  dengue  warning  signs.  There  are  no 
data on the use of Qdenga in subjects above 60 years of age and limited 
data  in  patients  with  chronic  medical  conditions”.  Information  is  also 
provided in PL Section 2. 
The impact of waning protection against dengue over time on the risk-
benefit balance is expected to be minimal.

Potential mechanisms:  
The  2009  WHO  criteria  classify  dengue  infection  according  to  levels  of 
severity:  dengue  without  warning  signs,  dengue  with  warning  signs  and 
severe dengue. Severe dengue is defined by one or more of the following 
criteria:  severe  plasma  leakage  that  may  lead  to  shock  and/or  fluid 
accumulation with or without respiratory distress and/or severe bleeding 
and/or severe organ impairment [100]. The most severe forms of dengue 
infection, dengue  haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and  dengue sock syndrome 
(DSS)  [58],  are  life  threatening.  Primary  infection  with  any  of  the 
4 dengue  serotypes  is  thought  to  result  in  life-long  protection  from 
re-infection  by  the  same  serotype  but  does  not  protect  against  a 
secondary infection by 1 of the 3 other dengue serotype and may lead to 
an increased risk of severe disease over the course of secondary infection

(DHF/DSS) [160]. 
In  wild  type  dengue,  severe  disease  is  mainly  observed  after  secondary 
infections, typically with a different serotype. 
infecting  serotype 
There are 4 distinct, but closely related, serotypes of the virus that cause 
dengue.  Following  a  primary  infection  with  one  dengue  virus  (DENV) 
(homotypic 
the 
serotype,  protection  against 
protection)  is  considered  long-lasting.  Temporary  cross-protection  is 
induced  to  the  other  serotypes  (heterotypic  protection),  lasting  2  years 
on  average.  Following  waning  of  cross-neutralizing  antibodies,  the  host-
immune  response  may  increase  the  severity  of  subsequent  DENV 
infections  with  different  serotypes.  Following  recovery  from  a  second 
infection,  broadly  cross-neutralizing  antibodies  are  induced  (multitypic 
protection),  such  that  severe  disease  with  tertiary  and  quaternary 
infections is considered rare [161]. 
The  mechanism  for  more  severe  disease  associated  with  a  second 
infection  is  not  well  understood  although  ADE  [162],  cytokine  storm 
[163,164] or cross-reactive T cells are hypothesized [165]. 
The  mechanism  for  a  higher  risk  of  severe  and  hospitalized  dengue  in 
seronegative  subjects  after  Dengvaxia  vaccination  is  currently  not 
understood  but  has  been  compared  to  the  phenomenon  of  secondary 
dengue  infection  in  the  wild  type  situation  [166]. Younger  children  may 
be  more  susceptible  to  this  phenomenon  as  this  group  includes  a  high 
proportion of subjects who are dengue seronegative. 
The  recombinant  construct  of  TDV  is  different  from  the  licensed  dengue 
vaccine  Dengvaxia  in  that  the  four  vaccine  viruses  use  the  replicative 
genetic backbone of a dengue virus (DENV-2; PDK 53) instead of the YF 
vaccine virus 17D. These  differences  result  in  an immunogenicity profile 
that  is  unique  to  TDV.  TDV  is  expected  to  elicit  CD8+  T-Cell  response 
directed  at  the  structural  and  non-structural  proteins  of  dengue  virus 
rather than the structural proteins of the dengue virus and non-structural 
proteins  of  the  YF  virus.  Generally,  virus  specific  cytotoxic  T-Cell 
responses  are  thought  to  be  important  for  the  rapid  clearance  of  viral 
infections  and  cytotoxic  T-Cell  responses  directed  against  dengue 
antigens have been associated with sub-clinical second dengue infections 
in children [167]. 
Evidence source(s) and 
strength of evidence: 
Today, severe dengue in the absence of dengue vaccination affects most 
Asian  and  Latin  American  countries  and  has  become  a  leading  cause  of 
hospitalization and death among children and adults in these regions [6]. 
Efficacy  results  by  baseline  dengue  serostatus  (determined  for  all 
subjects),  demonstrated  overall  VE  against  VCD  and  VCD  leading  to 
hospitalization  regardless  of  prior  exposure  to  dengue.  Efficacy  against 
individual  dengue  serotypes  varied.  The  totality  of  data  on  VCD, 
hospitalized  VCD,  and  severe  forms  of  dengue,  along  with  the  clinical 
characteristics  of  these  cases,  as  assessed  in  Trials  DEN-301,  DEN-313, 
and  DEN-204,  did  not  reveal  an  identified  risk  of  increased  disease 
severity or disease enhancement attributable  to vaccination in the post-
vaccination period.

Trial  DEN-301:  Severe  forms  of  dengue  (Dengue  Case  Adjudication 
Committee [DCAC]-defined severe dengue and DHF) from baseline up to 
54  months  after  the  last  vaccine  dose  (safety  set),  irrespective  of 
baseline serostatus and for all serotypes combined: 
•  Relative  risk  of  DCAC-defined  severe  dengue  (95%  CI):  0.30  (0.07, 
1.25) 
•  Relative risk of DHF (95% CI): 0.30 (0.13, 0.68) 
Exploratory efficacy analyses at 54 months after the second vaccine dose 
did not suggest efficacy for VCD caused by serotype DENV-3 in baseline 
seronegative subjects (RR: 1.11 [95% CI: 0.62, 1.99]). An imbalance in 
hospitalized  VCD  caused  by  DENV-3  was  noted  in  baseline  seronegative 
subjects, with 11 cases in the TDV group (0.3%) compared with 3 cases 
in  placebo  group  (0.2%),  with  a  relative  risk  of  1.81  (95%  CI:  0.51, 
6.48). 
In  the  baseline  seronegative  subgroup,  a  total  of  2  subjects  with  VCD 
were assessed as DCAC defined  severe  dengue (both  in the TDV group; 
0.05%  of  3714  subjects).  Both  cases  occurred  early  in  the  trial  during 
Parts  1  and  2  (i.e.,  before  18  months  post  second  dose).  Five  subjects 
experienced DHF as per programmed algorithm, WHO 1997 DHF criteria), 
4  of  3714  subjects  (0.11%)  in  the  TDV  group  and  1  of  1832  subjects 
(0.05%)  in  the  placebo  group.  Of  note,  1  of  these  4  DHF  cases  in  the 
TDV  group  was  also  classified  as  DCAC-defined  severe  dengue.  All  of 
these  cases  in  baseline  seronegative  subjects  were  caused  by  DENV-3. 
The  assessment  of  whether  TDV  may  be  associated  with  an  increased 
risk  of  severe  forms  of  dengue  in  baseline  seronegative  subjects  who 
experience  VCD  caused  by  serotype  DENV-3  remained  inconclusive;  the 
data are limited by the small number of cases. 
In  baseline  seronegative  subjects,  an  increased  risk  of  hospitalization 
and/or  severe  forms  of  dengue  caused  by  serotype  DENV-3  following 
vaccination in baseline seronegative subjects is considered an  important 
potential safety risk. 
The  evaluation  of  VE  against  VCD  caused  by  DENV-4  in  baseline 
seronegative subjects up to 54 months after the second dose was limited 
by  the  overall  small  number  cases  (n=15)  reflective  of  the  generally 
lowest prevalence for this dengue serotype worldwide. Additionally, most 
of  the  DENV-4  cases  occurred  in  the  later  part  of  the  trial  when  data 
indicated waning efficacy against other serotypes, which also precluded a 
robust conclusion. For instance, the VE in Year 1 post second dose could 
not be ascertained for DENV-4 in baseline seronegative subjects because 
no cases were reported in that period. Importantly, none of the DENV-4 
cases  in  the  TDV  group  in  baseline  seronegative  subjects  required 
hospitalization  or  were  a  severe  form  of  dengue,  which  suggested  no 
change in the severity of presentation. 
Conservatively,  risk  of  hospitalization  and/or  clinically  severe  forms  of 
dengue caused by serotype DENV-4 is considered an important potential 
safety risk in individuals not previously infected by dengue virus. 
Characterisation of the 
risk: 
WHO  estimated  that  in  the  absence  of  vaccination  about  3.9  billion 
people, in more than 128 countries, are at risk of dengue infection, with 
CONFIDENTIAL 
 
Dengue Tetravalent Vaccine (Live, Attenuated)

Version 1.0 
approximately 390 million dengue  infections occurring  annually  of  which 
96  million  manifests  clinically  (with  any  severity  of  disease).  About 
500,000  persons  require  hospitalization  due  to  warning  signs  or  severe 
dengue,  and  about  20,000  deaths  are  estimated  to  occur  due  to  severe 
dengue every year [148]. Patients with severe dengue require immediate 
emergency treatment to avert death and those with warning signs should 
be assessed and treated without delay. 
In  Trial  DEN-301,  the  incidence  and  relative  risk  of  VCD  overall  and 
hospitalized  VCD  up  to  54  months  after  the  second  vaccine  dose  (all 
4 serotypes combined) were lower in the TDV group than in the placebo 
group.  Overall,  442  VCD  cases  (0.7  cases  per  100  person-years)  were 
identified in the TDV group compared with 547 cases (1.9 cases per 100 
person-years)  in  the  placebo  group.  The  incidence  of  severe  forms  of 
dengue  (DCAC-defined  severe  dengue  and  DHF)  in  the  TDV  group  was 
<0.1 cases per 100 person-years. 
Up  to  54  months  after  the  second  dose,  the  incidences  of  hospitalised 
VCD  caused  by  DENV-3  were  low  (3  cases  in  the  placebo  group  and  12 
cases  in  the  TDV  group;  2:1  randomization  ratio  to  be  considered)  and 
fluctuated over time depending on local epidemiology and hospitalisation 
practices.  There  was  no  worsening  over  time  in  terms  of  potentially 
increased  severity  of  cases  caused  by  DENV-3  in  the  baseline 
seronegative  subpopulation:  two  cases  in  TDV  recipients  that  were 
assessed as severe by the independent adjudication committee occurred 
early in the trial during Parts 1 and 2 (ie, before 18 months  post second 
dose).  No  hospitalized  or  severe  forms  of  dengue  caused  by  DENV-4 
occurred in the TDV group. 
The  relative  risk  of  VCD  caused  by  DENV-3  in  baseline  seronegative 
subjects  declined  over  time,  with  a  relative  risk  point  estimate  of  <1 
during  Year  3  (relative  risk  0.91  [95%  CI:  0.34,  2.45])  and  Year  4 
(relative  risk  0  [95%  CI:  not  estimable]);  no  VCD  caused  by  DENV-3 
occurred  after  Year  4  up  to  the  end  of  Part  3.  This  is  reflected  in  the 
declining  trend  of  cumulative  relative  risks  assessed  at  12,  24,  36 
months after second dose (refer to CTD Module 2.7.4); the data obtained 
in the last 18 months of follow-up up to month 54 is consistent with this 
trend  (refer  to  CTD  Module  5.3.5.1:  DEN-301  M54  Data  Tables  and 
Graphs). 
Risk factors for severe dengue in unvaccinated subjects are described in 
section  Epidemiology  of  the  indication(s)  and  target  population(s)  (see 
Part II Module SI) and include persons with a secondary dengue infection 
of  a  heterologous  DENV  serotype,  co-morbidities,  nutritional  status,  the 
two  extremes  of  age,  genetic  composition,  pregnancy,  and  the  time 
interval since primary infection. 
The  main  risk  factor  found  for  severe  dengue  following  vaccination  with 
Dengvaxia  was  a  seronegative  baseline  status  [168].  The  risk  of  severe 
dengue  following  vaccination  of  seronegative  subjects  seemed  to  be 
related to the speed of the waning immunity in combination with the local 
dengue epidemiology [169]. 
In  the  Trial  DEN-301  for  TDV,  efficacy  results  by  baseline  dengue 
serostatus,  which  was  determined  for  all  subjects,  demonstrate  overall 
VE against VCD. The trial also showed high overall efficacy against DHF.

Preventability: 
Impact on the risk-
benefit balance of the 
product: 
In  Trial  DEN-301,  TDV  was  shown  to  be  efficacious  in  prevention  of 
symptomatic  dengue  manifesting  as  outpatient  fever,  febrile  illness 
requiring hospitalisation or DHF in subjects 4 to 16 years of age. 
The  SmPC  includes  in  Section  4.4  the  following  Special  warning  and 
Precaution for use: “A protective immune response with Qdenga may not 
be elicited in all vaccinees against all serotypes of dengue virus and may 
decline  over  time  (see  SmPC  Section  5.1).  It  is  currently  unknown 
whether  a  lack  of  protection  could  result  in  an  increased  severity  of 
dengue.  It  is  recommended  to  continue  personal  protection  measures 
against mosquito bites after vaccination. Individuals should seek medical 
care  if  they  develop  dengue  symptoms  or  dengue  warning  signs”. 
Information is also provided in PL Section 2. 
In  Trial  DEN-301,  TDV  was  shown  to  be  efficacious  in  prevention  of 
symptomatic  dengue  manifestations  as  outpatient  fever,  febrile  illness 
requiring  hospitalisation  or  DHF  in  subjects  4  to  16  years  of  age.  There 
was rapid onset of efficacy after the first dose, and efficacy was seen in 
varied epidemiological settings od Asia and Latin America in both dengue 
seropositive and seronegative subjects, while no additional risk of severe 
forms of dengue was identified. TDV has a positive benefit-risk balance in 
the  indication  proposed  and  TDV  could  play  an  important  role  as  a 
component  of  a  multimodal  approach  to  reducing  the  global  burden  of 
dengue. 
Public health impact: 
This  potential  risk  is  not  expected  to  have  a  serious  impact  on  public 
health. The overall  public health  impact  of severe dengue is provided in

SVII.3.2. Presentation of the missing information 
Safety profile of inadvertent use in pregnant or lactating women 
Evidence source: 
Population in need of further characterisation: 
A  study  in  rabbits  did  not  indicate  direct  or  indirect  harmful  effects 
insufficient  of  TDV  with  respect  to  reproductive  toxicity  (Module 
4.2.3.5.1,  Study  Report  20129939).  TDV  has  not  been  studied  in 
pregnant  women  because  pregnancy  was  an  exclusion  criterion  in  all 
clinical  trials.  There  are  limited  data  on  pregnancy  outcomes  following 
vaccine  dose  administration;  these  are  based  on  TDV  or  placebo 
inadvertently administered to women who were pregnant or who became 
pregnant  shortly  after  vaccination  (“exposed  pregnancies”).  These  data, 
however,  are  not  sufficient  to  conclude  on  the  absence  of  potential 
effects of TDV on pregnancy, embryo-fetal development, parturition, and 
postnatal development. 
There  are  conflicting  data  in  the  literature  regarding  the  association 
between wild type dengue infection during pregnancy and increased risks 
of  both  a  more  severe  course  of  disease  and  adverse  pregnancy 
outcomes [111-113]. 
As  with  other  live  attenuated  vaccines,  women  of  childbearing  potential 
should  avoid  pregnancy  for  at  least  1  month  following  vaccination. 
Women  who  intend  to  become  pregnant  should  be  advised  to  delay

vaccination. 
As  of  01  October  2020,  34  pregnancies  were  identified  as  exposed  to 
TDV:  27  had  normal  outcomes,  4  spontaneous  abortion  and  3  elective 
termination. There were no clinically important differences regarding the 
frequencies  of  spontaneous  abortions  or  elective  terminations  between 
women exposed to TDV and women exposed to placebo only. In addition, 
one  neonatal  death  occurred  after  an  exposed  pregnancy.  However,  the 
death was considered not causally related to TDV. 
It is unknown whether TDV is excreted in human milk. There are limited 
data  on  the  excretion  of  wild-type  dengue  via  breast  milk.  In  a  small 
study, dengue virus was detected in breast milk samples from 9 (75%) of 
12 infected breastfeeding mothers [127]. 
Qdenga  is  contraindicated  in  pregnant  and  breast-feeding  women  (see 
SmPC Section 4.3 Contraindications and PL Section 2). 
The SmPC Section 4.4 contains also Special warnings and precautions for 
use:  “As  with  other  live  attenuated  vaccines,  women  of  childbearing 
potential  should  avoid  pregnancy  for  at  least  one  month  following 
vaccination.”  Information  is  also  provided  in  SmPC  Section  4.6  and  PL 
Section 2. 
In  addition  to  the  impact  of  maternal  dengue  infection,  concerns  have 
been raised on  the effect  of  maternal infection on  subsequent infections 
in the infant. Declining levels of maternal antibodies have been shown to 
sensitize  infants  born  to  dengue-immune  mothers  to  severe  disease 
during  primary  infection,  through  the  process  of  antibody-dependent 
enhancement of infection [170,171]. 
Safety and immunogenicity in immunocompromised individuals 
Evidence source:  
Population in need of further characterisation: 
Generally,  live-attenuated  virus  vaccines  are  contraindicated  or  not 
recommended for use in severely immunocompromised individuals due to 
a potential risk of impaired immune response, uncontrolled replication of 
the  attenuated  vaccine  virus  or  vaccine  reversion  to  natural  virulence 
resulting in uncontrolled wild type disease [172]. 
Published  data  on  dengue  virus  infection  and  immunocompromised 
patients  come  from  case  reports  or  small  case  series  [173-178]  often 
with  mixed  patient  populations  (for  example  variability  in  underlying 
conditions  or  interventions,  differing  degrees  of  immunocompromised, 
different ethnic and geographical backgrounds). 
From the limited data available, overall clinical outcomes for dengue virus 
infection  in  immunocompromised  patients  appear  to  be  similar  to  those 
for dengue virus infection in immunocompetent patients. 
For  wild  type  DENV,  there  is  a  theoretical  risk  of  prolonged  dengue 
viremia  in  profoundly  immunocompromised  patients,  and  it  is  not  clear 
whether  dengue  virus  could  persist  in  certain  organs  after  becoming 
undetectable in serum or plasma. 
Ng  et  al.  [179]  reported  a  case  of  persistent  DENV  infection  in  a

renal 
transplant 
recipient  who  was 
lymphopenic 
therapeutically 
immunosuppressed to prevent organ rejection. Authors showed that low 
CD8+  T  cell  count  contributes  to  the  persistence  of  DENV—longer  in 
podocytes  and  coincidence  of  rising  CD8+  T  cell  count  with  viruria 
clearance  suggests that  cytotoxic T cells are  needed  for  sterilizing DENV 
infection. Their role in the clearance of acute human DENV infection has 
remained unclear although CD8+ T cell epitopes have been characterized 
in DENV patients [180] and animal models [165,181,182]. Delayed DENV 
clearance  has  been  observed  previously  in  a  renal  and  bone  marrow 
transplant patients, although the duration of viral persistence lasted only 
19  and  80 days,  respectively  [183,184].  The  patient  remained  RNAemic 
and  viruric  despite  consistently  detectable  levels  of  DENV-3  neutralizing 
antibodies.  Moreover,  the  IgG  subclass  composition  would  also  not 
prevent IgG antibodies from being secreted into the urine. 
These  observations  suggest  that  an  effective  DENV  vaccine  needs  to 
stimulate both humoral and cellular response. 
There  are  no  reliable  data  available  from  any  immunocompromised 
patient  group  to  assess  duration  of  viral  RNA  detection  in  blood,  semen 
or  other  compartments.  It  is  possible  that  severe  immunosuppression 
could  be  associated  with  more  severe  illness  following  flavivirus 
infections, but conclusive data are lacking. 
Immunocompromised  international  travellers  are  potentially  at  risk 
because the vaccine may not elicit a protective immune response and the 
risk of disease acquisition would be high [185]. 
Vaccination  with  TDV  was  not  studied  in  subjects  with  primary  or 
secondary immune deficiencies and is contraindicated in  individuals with 
congenital  or  acquired  immune  deficiency,  including  immunosuppressive 
therapies such as chemotherapy or high doses of systemic corticosteroids 
within  4  weeks  prior  to  vaccination  and  in  individuals  with  symptomatic 
HIV  infection  or  with  asymptomatic  HIV  infection  when  accompanied  by 
evidence of impaired immune function (SmPC Section 4.3)

Safety and immunogenicity of concomitant administration with other vaccines other than 
HAV and YF 
Evidence source:  
Population in need of further characterisation: 
Simultaneous  or  concomitant  administration  of  vaccines  is  defined  as 
administering more than one vaccine on the same clinic day, at different 
anatomic sites, and not combined in the same syringe [186]. 
Potential  interactions  between  concomitantly  administered  vaccines  may 
compromise  the  immunogenicity/effectiveness  (e.g.,  vaccination  failure 
from  interference)  and/or  safety  (e.g.,  increased  rates  or  severity  of 
adverse events). 
Recent  reviews  on  the  simultaneous  administration  of  the  most  widely 
used live and inactivated vaccines has produced seroconversion rates and 
rates for adverse  reactions similar to those  observed when the  vaccines 
are administered separately [187-190]. 
Co-administration of TDV with YF and HAV vaccines was evaluated in two 
phase  3  trials  conducted  in  non-endemic  areas  (DEN-305  and  DEN-314 
respectively). 
TDV  may  be  administered  concomitantly  with  an  HAV  vaccine. 
Coadministration has only been studied in adults. 
TDV  may  be  administered  concomitantly  with  a  YF  vaccine.  In  a  clinical 
study  involving  approximately  300  adult  subjects  who  received  TDV 
concomitantly  with  YF  17D  vaccine,  there  was  no  effect  on  YF 
seroprotection  rates.  Dengue  antibody  responses  were  decreased 
following  concomitant  administration  of  TDV  and  YF  17D  vaccine.  The 
clinical significance of this finding is unknown. (SmPC Section 4.5). 
Co-administration data with other  vaccines,  other  than  YF and  HAV, are 
missing.

Safety and reactogenicity of a booster dose  
Evidence source:  
Population in need of further characterisation: 
Although a generally consistent overall efficacy and continued protection 
against  hospitalised  dengue  is  observed  after  a  2-dose  vaccination 
regimen with TDV (two single doses 3 months apart), data also indicate a 
trend of declining efficacy over time, as reflected in lower vaccine efficacy 
estimates  in  Years  2  and  3  compared  with  the  preceding  period.  This 
observation  suggests  a  waning  in  vaccine  efficacy  and  therefore  the 
effect  of  a  booster  dose  is  being  investigated  in  2  ongoing  clinical  trials 
(DEN-301 and DEN-303). 
Currently,  the  need  for  a  booster  dose  has  not  been  established  (SmPC

III.1. Routine pharmacovigilance activities 
Routine  pharmacovigilance  activities beyond  adverse  reaction  reporting  and  signal  detection  are  in 
place for several safety concerns as described below. 
Other forms of routine pharmacovigilance activities for the following safety concerns: 
Cumulative  reviews  will  be  conducted  for  the  following  safety  concerns:  Anaphylaxis  including

and immunogenicity of concomitant administration with other vaccines. 
The objectives of these activities are to closely monitor the safety concerns mentioned above. These 
analyses will be done every 6 months. 
Any spontaneous reports in the post-marketing setting of inadvertent exposure during pregnancy or 
lactation will be followed as required to ensure adequate and timely collection of case information, 
collation,  follow-up,  assessment  and  reporting  in  accordance  with  regulations.  In  addition,

Rationale and study objectives: 
The WHO recommends a long-term follow-up to evaluate safety of dengue vaccines for 3 to 5 years. 
The total follow-up period including Parts 1, 2 and 3 of this study last 4 to 4.5 years after the second 
dose. Part 3 fulfils the WHO recommendation of long-term follow-up to evaluate safety.  The booster 
phase of this phase III trial is comprised of 2 parts (Parts 4 and 5).  Part 4 includes modified active 
surveillance  post-booster  vaccination  and  lasts  a  minimum  of  13  months  for  each  subject.  Part  5 
includes  modified  active  surveillance  following  the  completion  of  Part  4  and  lasts  1  year  for  each 
subject.

Study design: 
This is a phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with 2 parallel groups. 20,099 
participants were enrolled and randomly assigned 2:1 to receive two doses of TAK-003 or two doses 
of placebo. The trial includes 3 time periods (Parts 1, 2 and 3) for surveillance of febrile illness with 
potential  dengue  aetiology.  The  trial  includes  2  additional  time  periods  (Parts  4  and  5)  for 
surveillance of febrile illness with potential dengue aetiology for subjects participating in the booster 
phase of the trial. 
Part 1 constitutes the primary analysis period, including primary efficacy analysis. 
Part 2 constitutes a period of additional active surveillance for secondary efficacy analyses. 
Part  3  constitutes  modified  active  surveillance  for  the  assessment  of  long-term  safety.  Part  3  is  a 
modified active surveillance for the assessment of safety in all subjects following the completion of 
Part  2  and  lasting  2.5  to  3  years  for  each  subject.  The  modified  surveillance  during  Part  3  will 
maintain at least weekly contacts through Part 3 of the trial, but the intensity of investigation will be 
modified based on the need for hospitalization. Surveillance will identify febrile illness of any severity 
that  could  potentially  be  due  to  dengue.  All  virologically  confirmed  hospitalized  dengue  cases  are 
adjudicated to identify cases of severe dengue. 
Part  4  and  5  constitute  a  period  of  modified  active  surveillance  for  exploratory  efficacy,

Long-term  safety  and  antibody  persistence  of  TDV  and  the  impact  of  a  booster  dose  in 
Trial DEN-303  
Study short name and title: 
DEN-303  -  A Phase 3, Follow-up Trial to Evaluate Long-term Safety and Antibody Persistence, and 
the Impact of a Booster  Dose  of TDV  in  Healthy  Adolescents and  Adults in  Areas Non-Endemic for 
Dengue. 
Rationale and study objectives: 
This Phase 3 trial will evaluate long-term antibody persistence and safety data in healthy subjects in 
areas  non-endemic  for  dengue  who  have  previously  received  a  primary  TDV  vaccination  in  either 
DEN-304  and  DEN-315  trials (termed here as “parent trials”).  The  immunogenicity  and  safety of a 
TDV booster dose in this population will then be assessed. 
The primary objectives are: 
•  To describe antibody persistence  for  each  of the  4 dengue serotypes for up to 63 months after 
the  first  vaccination  in  the  primary  vaccination  series  for  subjects  from  parent  Trial  DEN-315 
(Mexico) and for up to 36 months after the first vaccination in the primary vaccination series for 
subjects from parent Trial DEN-304 (United States). 
•  To describe the impact  of a TDV booster  dose vs placebo  on antibody response  for each of the 
4 dengue  serotypes  at  1  month  and  6  months  post  administration  of  the  TDV  booster  or 
placebo.  
The secondary objectives are: 
Immunogenicity 
Antibody Persistence 
•  To describe the overall trend in antibody decay for all 4 dengue serotypes from values obtained 
after  the  primary  vaccination  series  in  the  parent  trials  through  63  months  after  the  first 
vaccination  in  the  primary  vaccination  series  for  subjects  from  parent  Trial  DEN-315  (Mexico) 
and through 36 months after the first vaccination in the primary vaccination series for subjects 
from parent Trial DEN-304 (United States).

•  To  describe  the  impact  of  a  TDV  booster  on  antibody  response  for  each  of  the  4  dengue 
serotypes for up to 69 months following the first vaccination in the primary vaccination series for 
subjects  from  the  parent  Trial  DEN-315  (Mexico)  and  for  up  to  42  months  following  the  first 
vaccination  in  the  primary  vaccination  series  for  subjects  from  parent  Trial  DEN-304  (United 
States). 
Safety 
•  To  describe  the  long-term  safety  of  TDV  for  up  to  63  months  in  previously  vaccinated  subjects 
from parent Trial DEN-315 (Mexico) and for  up to 36 months in previously vaccinated subjects 
from parent Trial DEN-304 (United States). 
•  To assess safety for 6 months following administration of the TDV booster or placebo in Group 1 
and 2, respectively*. 
*Group 1 = TDV, Group 2 = Placebo 
Exploratory Objectives: 
Applicable to subjects from parent trial DEN-315 (Mexico only): 
•  To evaluate aspects of the long-term humoral immune response to Takeda’s TDV in all subjects 
at 63 months after the first vaccination in the primary vaccination series in the parent trials; this 
is inclusive of, but not restricted to, an assessment of the anti-dengue Non-Structural Protein 1 
(NS1) antibody response. 
Applicable to subjects from parent Trial DEN-304 (United States only): 
•  To evaluate aspects of the long-term humoral immune response to Takeda’s TDV in all subjects 
at  36  months  after  the  first  vaccination  in  the  primary  vaccination  series  in  the  parent  trial 
(DEN-304),  and  in  the  CMI  subset  at  1  month  and  6  months  post  booster  in the  current  trial; 
this  is  inclusive  of,  but  not  restricted  to,  an  assessment  of  the  antidengue  NS1  antibody 
response. 
•  To  evaluate  aspects  of  the  long-term  cell-mediated  immune  response  to  Takeda’s  TDV  up  to 
36 months after the first vaccination in the primary vaccination series in the parent trial (DEN-
304) and at 1 month and 6 months post booster in the current trial; this is inclusive of, but not 
restricted  to,  the  magnitude  (Interferon-gamma  Enzyme-Linked  Immunospot  [IFN-γ  ELISpot]) 
of the long-term T cell-mediated immune response to TDV (CMI subset only). 
Study design:  
This is a Phase 3 follow-up trial that will evaluate the long-term antibody persistence and safety of 
Takeda’s TDV in healthy adolescents and adults in areas non-endemic for dengue in addition to 
assessing the impact of a booster dose in this population. . Subjects who previously received TDV in 
two parent trials, DEN-304 and DEN-315, are invited to participate in this follow-up trial. DEN-303 
will include up to 600 healthy subjects aged ≥13 to ≤63 years at trial entry. To enable the 
assessment of a booster dose, the trial will be double-blinded, randomized, and placebo-controlled 
from Visit 3 onwards.  
Study population: 
Healthy  subjects  aged  ≥13  and  ≤63  years  at  trial  entry  in  areas  non-endemic  for  dengue  who 
received at least one dose of Takeda’s TDV in the parent trial.

Immunogenicity  and  safety  of  TDV  and  9vHPV  in  subjects  aged  ≥9  to  <15  years  in  Trial 
DEN-308 
Study short name and title: 
DEN-308 – A phase 3 open-label, randomised trial to investigate the immunogenicity and safety of 
the  co-administration  of  a  subcutaneous  dengue  tetravalent  vaccine  (live,  attenuated)  and 
intramuscular recombinant  9-valent human  papillomavirus  (9vHPV) vaccine in  subjects aged  ≥9 to 
<15 years in endemic country for dengue. 
Rationale and study objectives: 
The  WHO  recommends  that  new  vaccines  should  be  introduced  according  to  existing  national 
immunisation  programs.  Recombinant  9-valent  human  papillomavirus  (HPV)  vaccine 
is 
recommended  either  in  a  2-dose  or  3-dose  schedule  6  to  12  months  apart  in  subjects  9  through 
14 years  of  age.  Further,  if  the  second  dose  is  administered  earlier  than  5  months  after  the  first 
dose,  then  a  third  dose  should  be  administered  at  least  4  months  after  the  second  dose.  Many 
similarities exist between the proposed vaccination schedule for TDV and the approved schedule for 
9-valent HPV (9vHPV) vaccine, including the overlapping target age group and the potential delivery 
through school immunisation programs. 
In order to avoid barriers to the inclusion of TDV in routine national vaccination programs, the effect 
of adding TDV to such programs needs to be examined. This is particularly relevant for low-income 
countries where the  cost  of a standalone  vaccination could  be too  high,  and  potentially  undermine 
TDV uptake, if inclusion in routine vaccine schedules were not possible. 
Study design:  
This  is  a  phase  3,  open-label,  randomised,  multicentre  trial  in  614  healthy  subjects  aged  ≥9  to 
<15 years  in  endemic  areas  for  dengue  to  investigate  the  immunogenicity  and  safety  of  the 
co-administration  of  TDV  and  9vHPV  vaccine  versus  9vHPV  vaccine  alone.  Subjects  will  be 
randomized equally to 1 of 2 groups (307 subjects per trial group): 
Group  1:  first  doses  of  9vHPV  vaccine  +  TDV  co-administered  on  Day  1  (Month  0  [M0]),  second 
dose of TDV administered on Day 90 (M3), second dose of 9vHPV vaccine administered on Day 180 
(M6). 
Group  2:  first  dose  of  9vHPV  vaccine  administered  on  Day  1  (M0),  second  dose  of  9vHPV  vaccine 
administered on Day 180 (M6). 
The primary objective is: 
•  To  demonstrate  the  non-inferiority  (NI)  of  the  immune  response  (in  terms  of  geometric  mean 
titers [GMTs]) to 2 doses of 9vHPV vaccine, 1 co-administered with TDV, compared with 2 doses 
of 9vHPV vaccine administered alone. 
The secondary objectives are: 
Immunogenicity 
•  To  describe  the  immune  response  to  HPV  (in  terms  of  seroresponse)  in  subjects  administered 
2 doses  of  9vHPV  vaccine,  1  co-administered  with  TDV,  compared  with  subjects  administered 
2 doses of 9vHPV vaccine alone. 
•  To  describe  the  immune  response  to  TDV  at  1  month  following  a  second  dose  of  TDV  given 
3 months after the first dose of TDV administered concomitantly with 9vHPV vaccine. 
Safety 
•  To describe the safety profile after administration of TDV concomitantly with 9vHPV vaccine.

Important  risks  of  Dengue  Tetravalent  Vaccine  (Live,  Attenuated)  Takeda,  together  with  measures 
to  minimise  such  risks  and  the  proposed  studies  for  learning  more  about  Dengue  Tetravalent 
Vaccine (Live, Attenuated) Takeda risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific  information,  such  as  warnings,  precautions,  and  advice  on  correct  use,  in  the  package 
leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The  authorised  pack  size  —  the  amount  of  medicine  in  a  pack  is  chosen  so  to  ensure  that  the 
medicine is used correctly;

II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Dengue Tetravalent Vaccine (Live, Attenuated) Takeda are risks that need special 
risk management activities to further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product 
can  be  safely  administered.  Important  risks  can  be  regarded  as  identified  or  potential.  Identified 
risks  are  concerns  for  which  there  is  sufficient  proof  of  a  link  with  the  use  of  Dengue  Tetravalent 
Vaccine (Live, Attenuated) Takeda. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use 
of  this  medicine  is  possible  based  on  available  data,  but  this  association  has  not  been  established 
yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information  refers  to  information  on  the  safety  of  the 
medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of 
the medicine).

Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Clinical risk factors that have been identified for anaphylaxis are: 
-  history  of  allergies  to  the  active  substances  or  any  of  the  other 
components  of  the  Dengue  Tetravalent  Vaccine  (Live,  Attenuated) 
Takeda referred to as TDV vaccine, 
-  history  of  an  allergic  reaction  after  a  previous  immunisation  with 
TDV, 
-  coexisting atopic disease, particularly asthma. 
However,  allergic  reactions  may  occur  in  patients  without  known  risk 
factors.

Important potential risk: Dengue disease due to waning protection against dengue over time  
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
In  a  year-by-year  analysis  until  4.5  years  after  the  second  dose  in 
Trial DEN-301, VE in preventing VCD was shown for all four serotypes 
in  baseline  dengue  seropositive  subjects.  In  baseline  seronegative 
subjects,  VE  was  shown  for  DENV-1  and  DENV-2,  but  not  suggested 
for DENV-3 and could not be shown robustly for DENV-4 due to lower 
incidence  of  cases.  During  the  third  year  of  Trial  DEN-301,  although 
some decline in efficacy  compared with Year  2 was  observed, largely 
driven  by  non-hospitalized  VCD  cases,  efficacy  against  VCD  was 
demonstrated  overall,  as  well  as  in  both  baseline  seronegative  and 
seropositive  subjects.  Efficacy  against  VCD  leading  to  hospitalization 
remained  robust  with  little  change  compared  with  Year  2.  The  data 
obtained  in  the  last  18 months  of  follow-up  up  to  Month  54  showed 
continued  long-term  protection  against  overall  VCD  and  a  sustained 
high level of protection against hospitalized VCD regardless of baseline 
serostatus. 
Waning  immunity  resulting  in  a  loss  of  protection  over  time  is 
applicable  to  all  vaccines.  The  maximum  duration  of  protection  with 
TDV is not known currently.

pharmacovigilance 
activities 
In  general,  lack  of  response  to  vaccination  can  occur  due  to 
immunodeficiency, elderly age, interference due to wild type infectious 
agents,  acute  or  chronic  disease  and  suboptimal  health,  as  well  as 
nutritional  status,  immunological  interference.  In  addition,  there  may 
be failure to respond due to the normal expected variation in immune 
response  across  healthy  individuals  (i.e.,  a  “low  responder”  or  “non-
responder). 
Additionally,  vaccine  effectiveness  may  wane  with  increasing  time 
since  vaccination.  Depending  on  the  vaccine,  rates  of  decline  of 
vaccine effectiveness may vary across antigens. A number of variables 
influence  duration  of  vaccine  protection,  including  age,  serostatus  at 
vaccination, presence or absence of exposures to circulating wild type 
virus  (natural  boosting),  possible  evolution  of  the  wild  type  virus,  as 
well as unknown factors. 
No risk factors have been identified for TDV vaccination failure.

Risk minimisation 
measures 
Efficacy  results  by  baseline  dengue  serostatus  (determined  for  all 
subjects),  demonstrated  overall  VE  against  VCD  and  VCD  leading  to 
hospitalization regardless of prior exposure to dengue. Efficacy against 
individual  dengue  serotypes  varied.  The  totality  of  data  on  VCD, 
hospitalized VCD, and severe forms of dengue, along with the clinical 
characteristics  of  these  cases,  as  assessed  in  Trials  DEN-301,  DEN-
313,  and  DEN-204,  did  not  reveal  an  identified  risk  of  increased 
disease severity or disease enhancement attributable to vaccination in 
the post-vaccination period. 
Exploratory  efficacy  analyses  at  54  months  after  the  second  vaccine 
dose  did  not  suggest  efficacy  for  VCD  caused  by  serotype  DENV-3  in 
baseline  seronegative  subjects  (RR:  1.11  [95%  CI:  0.62,  1.99]).  For 
hospitalized  VCD  caused  by  DENV-3  there  were  with  11  cases  in  the 
TDV  group  (0.3%)  compared  with  3  cases  in  placebo  group  (0.2%), 
with a relative risk of 1.81 (95% CI: 0.51, 6.48). 
In the baseline seronegative subgroup, a total of 2 subjects with VCD 
were  assessed  as  severe  dengue  as  defined  by  the  Adjudication 
Committee  (both  in  the  TDV  group;  0.05%  of  3714  subjects).  Both 
cases  occurred  early  in  the  trial  during  Parts  1  and  2  (i.e.,  before 
18 months  post  second  dose).  Five  subjects  experienced  DHF  as  per 
programmed  algorithm,  WHO  1997  DHF  criteria),  4  of  3714  subjects 
(0.11%)  in  the  TDV  group  and  1  of  1832  subjects  (0.05%)  in  the 
placebo group. Of note, 1 of these 4 DHF cases in the TDV group was 
also  classified  as  DCAC-defined  severe  dengue.  All  of  these  cases  in 
baseline  seronegative  subjects  were  caused  by  DENV-3.  The 
assessment of whether TDV may be associated with an increased risk 
of  severe  forms  of  dengue  in  baseline  seronegative  subjects  who 
experience  VCD  caused  by  serotype  DENV-3  remained  inconclusive; 
the  data  are  limited  by  the  small  number  of  cases.  In  baseline 
seronegative  subjects,  an  increased  risk  of  hospitalization  and/or 
clinically severe forms of dengue caused by serotype DENV-3 following 
vaccination  in  subjects  not  previously  infected  by  dengue  virus  is 
considered an important potential safety risk. 
Conservatively, due to limited data for DENV-4, risk of hospitalization 
due  to  dengue  and/or  clinically  severe  forms  of  dengue  caused  by 
serotype  DENV-4  in  baseline  seronegative  subjects  is  considered  an 
important  potential  safety  risk,  although  up  the  54  months  after  the 
second vaccine dose no hospitalisations caused by DENV-4 occurred in 
TDV recipients. 
No risk factors for severe dengue with TDV have been identified.

Efficacy, Safety and Immunogenicity of TDV in Trial DEN-301 (Part 4 and 5) 
Purpose of the study: 
WHO recommends long-term follow-up to evaluate the safety of dengue vaccines for 3 to 5 years. 
The total follow-up period including Parts 1, 2 and 3 of this study last 4 to 4.5 years after the second 
dose. For those participants in the booster phase, Parts 4 and 5, there is approximately 2 years of 
additional follow-up. 
Long-term safety and antibody persistence of TDV and the impact of a booster dose (Trial 
DEN-303) 
Purpose of the study: 
This Phase 3 trial will evaluate long-term antibody persistence and safety data in healthy subjects in 
areas  non-endemic  for  dengue  who  have  previously  received  a  primary  TDV  vaccination  in  either 
DEN-304  and  DEN-315  trials  (termed  here  as  “parent  trials”).  It  will  then  go  on  to  assess  the 
immunogenicity and safety of a TDV booster dose in this population. 
Immunogenicity  and  safety  of  TDV  and  9vHPV  in  subjects  aged  ≥9  to  <15  years  (Trial 
DEN-308) 
Purpose of the study: 
The  WHO  recommends  that  new  vaccines  should  be  introduced  according  to  existing  national 
immunisation  programs.  Recombinant  9-valent  human  papillomavirus  (HPV)  vaccine 
is 
recommended either in a 2-dose or 3-dose schedule 6 to 12 months apart in subjects 9 through 14 
years of age. Further, if the second dose is administered earlier than 5 months after the first dose, 
then a third dose should be administered at least 4 months after the second dose. Many similarities 
exist  between  the  proposed  vaccination  schedule  for  TDV  and  the  approved  schedule  for  9-valent 
HPV (9vHPV) vaccine, including the overlapping target age group and the potential delivery through 
school immunisation programs. 
In order to avoid barriers to the inclusion of TDV in routine national vaccination programs, the effect 
of adding TDV to such programs needs to be examined. This is particularly relevant for low-income 
countries where  the cost  of a standalone vaccination  could  be too high, and  potentially undermine 
TDV uptake, if inclusion in routine vaccine schedules were not possible.

Summary  of  risk  management  plan  for  Qdenga  (Dengue 
tetravalent vaccine (live, attenuated)) – EU MAA 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Qdenga. The RMP details important risks 
of  Qdenga,  how  these  risks  can  be  minimised,  and  how  more  information  will  be  obtained  about 
Qdenga's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Qdenga's  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet  give  essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Qdenga should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Qdenga should be read in the context of all this information including 
the  assessment  report  of  the  evaluation  and  its  plain-language  summary,  all  which  is  part  of  the 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Qdenga's RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Qdenga is authorised for the prevention of  dengue  disease in individuals from  4 years of age (see 
SmPC  for the full  indication).  It contains Dengue  virus serotype 1 (live, attenuated), Dengue virus 
serotype 2 (live, attenuated), Dengue virus serotype 3 (live, attenuated) and Dengue virus serotype 
4 (live, attenuated) as the active substances and it is given by subcutaneous injection. 
Further information about the evaluation of Qdenga’s benefits can be found in Qdenga’s EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s 
webpage:  
[ENTER LINK TO THE EPAR SUMMARY LANDING PAGE]. 
II.  Risks  associated  with  the  medicine  and  activities  to  minimise  or 
further characterise the risks  
Important risks of Qdenga, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies 
for learning more about Qdenga's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific  information,  such  as  warnings,  precautions,  and  advice  on  correct  use,  in  the  package 
leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The  authorised  pack  size  —  the  amount  of  medicine  in  a  pack  is  chosen  so  to  ensure  that  the 
medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or without 
prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  reactions  is  collected  continuously  and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. 
These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.

demonstrated  overall,  as  well  as  in  both  baseline  seronegative  and 
seropositive  subjects.  Efficacy  against  VCD  leading  to  hospitalization 
remained  robust  with  little  change  compared  with  Year  2.  The  data 
obtained  in  the  last  18 months  of  follow-up  up  to  Month  54  showed 
continued  long-term  protection  against  overall  VCD  and  a  sustained 
high  level  of  protection  against  hospitalized  VCD  regardless  of

Waning  immunity  resulting  in  a  loss  of  protection  over  time  is 
applicable  to  all  vaccines.  The  maximum  duration  of  protection  with

(0.11%)  in  the  TDV  group  and  1  of  1832  subjects  (0.05%)  in  the 
placebo group. Of note, 1 of these 4 DHF cases in the TDV group was 
also  classified  as  DCAC-defined  severe  dengue.  All  of  these  cases  in 
baseline  seronegative  subjects  were  caused  by  DENV-3.  The 
assessment of whether TDV may be associated with an increased risk 
of  severe  forms  of  dengue  in  baseline  seronegative  subjects  who 
experience  VCD  caused  by  serotype  DENV-3  remained  inconclusive; 
the  data  are  limited  by  the  small  number  of  cases.  In  baseline 
seronegative  subjects,  an  increased  risk  of  hospitalization  due  to 
dengue  and/or  clinically  severe  forms  of  dengue  caused  by  serotype 
DENV-3 is considered an important potential safety risk. 
Conservatively, due to limited data for DENV-4, risk of hospitalization 
due  to  dengue  and/or  clinically  severe  forms  of  dengue  caused  by 
serotype  DENV-4  in  baseline  seronegative  subjects  is  considered  an 
important  potential  safety  risk,  although  up  the  54  months  after  the 
second vaccine dose no hospitalisations caused by DENV-4 occurred in 
TDV recipients. 
Risk factors and risk groups  No risk factors for severe dengue with TDV have been identified.

Efficacy, Safety and Immunogenicity of TDV in Trial DEN-301 (Part 4 and 5) 
Purpose of the study: 
WHO recommends long-term follow-up to evaluate the safety of dengue vaccines for 3 to 5 years. 
The total follow-up period including Parts 1, 2 and 3 of this study last 4 to 4.5 years after the second 
dose. For those participants in the booster phase, parts 4 and 5, there is approximately 2 years of 
additional follow-up. 
Long-term  safety  and  antibody  persistence  of  TDV  and  the  impact  of  a  booster  dose 
(study DEN-303) 
Purpose of the study: 
This Phase 3 trial will evaluate long-term antibody persistence and safety data in healthy subjects in 
areas  non-endemic  for  dengue  who  have  previously  received  a  primary  TDV  vaccination  in  either 
DEN-304  and  DEN-315  trials  (termed  here  as  “parent  trials”).  It  will  then  go  on  to  assess  the 
immunogenicity and safety of a TDV booster dose in this population. 
Immunogenicity  and  safety  of  TDV  and  9vHPV  in  subjects  aged  ≥9  to  <15  years  (study 
DEN-308) 
Purpose of the study: 
The  WHO  recommends  that  new  vaccines  should  be  introduced  according  to  existing  national 
immunisation  programs.  Recombinant  9-valent  human  papillomavirus  (HPV)  vaccine 
is 
recommended either in a 2-dose or 3-dose schedule 6 to 12 months apart in subjects 9 through 14 
years of age. Further, if the second dose is administered earlier than 5 months after the first dose, 
then a third dose should be administered at least 4 months after the second dose. Many similarities 
exist  between  the  proposed  vaccination  schedule  for  TDV  and  the  approved  schedule  for  9-valent 
HPV (9vHPV) vaccine, including the overlapping target age group and the potential delivery through 
school immunisation programs. 
In order to avoid barriers to the inclusion of TDV in routine national vaccination programs, the effect 
of adding TDV to such programs needs to be examined. This is particularly relevant for low-income 
countries where the  cost  of a standalone vaccination  could be  too  high, and  potentially  undermine 
TDV uptake, if inclusion in routine vaccine schedules were not possible.

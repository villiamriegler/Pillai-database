2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Signifor  contains  the  new  chemical  entity  pasireotide  and  is  a  novel  somatostatin  analogue  (SSA) 
exerting its pharmacological activity through binding to somatostatin receptors. Pasireotide is a novel 
cyclohexapeptide containing the amino acids lysine, tryptophane, phenylglycine, aminoethylcarbamoyl-
hydroxyproline, phenylalanine and O-benzyltyrosine. 
Pasireotide is provided as pasireotide diaspartate and has been has been formulated as 0.3 mg/1 ml, 
0.6 mg/1 ml and 0.9 mg/1 ml solution for injection in ampoules.  
The marketing authorisation application concerns the following indication: 
  Signifor  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  Cushing’s  disease  for  whom  surgery  is 
not an option or for whom surgery has failed. 
Signifor is  intended  for  subcutaneous  injections  twice  daily  by  self injection.  The  recommended  initial 
dose is 0.6 mg s.c. twice daily. A dose increase to 0.9 mg may be considered based on the response to 
the  treatment,  as  long  as  the  0.6 mg  dose  is  well  tolerated  by  the  patient.  There  are  no  dose 
adjustments  recommended  in  the  elderly  or  in  renal  impairment.  The  recommended  initial  dose  for 
patients  with  moderate  or  severe  hepatic  impairment  is  0.3 mg  twice  a  day,  with  a  maximum 
recommended dose of 0.6 mg twice a day. 
Cushing’s disease 
Cushing’s  disease  is  a  very  rare,  debilitating,  and  life-threatening  disease  that  is  caused  by  an 
adrenocorticotropic  hormone  (ACTH)-secreting  pituitary  adenoma  most  commonly  affecting  adult 
females. The tumours are usually microadenomas (≤ 1 cm in diameter); macroadenomas are rare. The 
elevated  levels  of  ACTH  secreted  by  these  tumours  stimulate  the  adrenal  glands  to  produce  excess 
cortisol,  thereby  leading  to  the  subsequent  development  of  the  clinical  signs  and  symptoms  of 
hypercortisolism. In patients with Cushing’s disease, most adenomatous cells develop a high set-point 
for feedback inhibition of ACTH secretion by cortisol, which may lead to loss of tumour differentiation 
to the point where increased cortisol levels can no longer suppress ACTH production and release. 
The  most  common  pathologic  finding  in  Cushing’s  disease  patients  is  bilateral  hyperplasia  of  the 
adrenal  cortex  due  to  excessive  stimulation  of  the  adrenal  glands  by  uncontrolled  ACTH  secretion  by 
the  pituitary  adenoma.  The  primary  clinical  symptoms  of  Cushing’s  disease  are  due  to 
hypercortisolism. As a result, patients with Cushing's disease have increased morbidity and a mortality 
rate 4 times higher than age- and gender-matched subjects. 
Pituitary  resection  of  the  adenoma  is  the  current  first-line  therapy  for  Cushing’s  disease,  but  surgical 
failure rates range between 8 to 31% even in the hands of the most experienced neurosurgeons, and 
post-operative recurrence rates are between 5 and 34%. Repeat pituitary surgery may be undertaken 
Page 8/90
 
 
 
if disease persists after initial surgery, although there is an overall lower rate of success than that seen 
after the first operation. 
For  patients  not  cured  by  pituitary  surgery  (either  1  or  multiple  attempts),  irradiation  (fractionated 
external beam radiotherapy or stereotactic radiosurgery) of the pituitary or bilateral adrenalectomy are 
the remaining non-medical treatment options. 
Available medical options generally fill a short-term, palliative role and are rarely used alone as long-
term therapy. The use of these drugs is based on limited data; their safety and efficacy profiles are not 
well established. 
In the following section, the efficacy and safety of commonly used medications are summarised.   
Ketoconazole  is  an  anti-fungal  agent  that  inhibits  the  synthesis  of  cortisol,  adrenal  and  gonadal 
androgens.  It  is  an  11β-hydroxylase  and  17α-hydroxylase  inhibitor,  which  leads  to  a  decrease  in 
cortisol  production.  Published  studies  on  the  use  of  ketoconazole  in  Cushing’s  syndrome  are  small 
and/or  retrospective.  The  initial  efficacy  with  ketoconazole  (normalization  of  UFC)  is  up  to  81%  of 
patients  with  Cushing’s  disease,  but  escape  is  possible  requiring  continued  dose  escalation  with  an 
increased risk of side effects. 
Metyrapone  is  a  pyridine  which  acts  by  blocking  11β-hydroxilase,  thus  inhibiting  aldosterone 
biosynthesis.  There  are  no  large  prospective  studies  on  the  efficacy  of  metyrapone  as  monotherapy. 
Treatment  with  metyrapone  in  combination  with  radiation  therapy  or  other  drugs  normalised  plasma 
cortisol in up to 74% of patients with Cushing’s disease and Cushing’s syndrome. Reduction of cortisol 
levels  may  induce  an  increase  in  pituitary  ACTH  secretion.  Therefore,  like  with  other  steroidogenesis 
directed therapies, escape phenomenon is common. 
Mitotane is a compound with similar chemical structure as the insecticide DDT. It has been used in the 
treatment  of  adrenocortical  carcinomas  due  to  its  adrenolytic  action.  It  also  is  an  inhibitor  of  11β-
hydroxylase,  18-hydroxylase  and  3β-hydroxysteroid  dehydrogenase.  There  are  no  reported  large 
prospective  studies  on  the  use  of  mitotane  in  patients  with  Cushing’s  disease.  In  combination  with 
radiation  therapy,  remission  rates  have  been  seen  in  up  to  81%  of  patients.  Nevertheless,  60%  of 
these patients subsequently relapsed and needed additional courses of drug or radiation therapy. 
Mifepristone  is  a  synthetic  steroid  that  has  high  affinity  for  the  glucocorticoid  and  progesterone 
receptors,  acting  as  a  competitive  antagonist.  Mifepristone  appears  to  inhibit  glucocorticoid  receptor 
activation. The safety and efficacy of mifepristone is currently being studied in a clinical development 
programme in Cushing’s syndrome; results have not yet been published. Mifepristone acts very quickly 
in  decreasing  some  of  the  signs  of  hypercortisolism,  specially  the  psychotic  manifestations. 
Mifepristone causes ACTH levels to increase causing an exacerbation of hypercortisolism. 
Cabergoline  is  a  dopamine  receptor  agonist  used  for  the  treatment  of  prolactinomas  and  (at  high 
doses)  Parkinson’s  disease.  The  rationale  for  the  use  of  cabergoline  in  Cushing’s  disease  is  the 
expression  of  dopamine  receptors  in  some  corticotroph  pituitary  adenomas.  While  there  are  some 
retrospective studies and case reports  in patients with ACTH-dependent Cushing’s syndrome, there is 
only  1  prospective  study  on  the  use  of  cabergoline  as  monotherapy.  In  this  single  center  study  20 
patients with Cushing’s disease were treated with cabergoline. A sustained response (normalization of 
urine free cortisol) was obtained in 8 patients (40%) after 24 months of treatment, however selection 
bias  (patients  with  dopamine-receptor  positive  adenomas)  cannot  be  ruled  out.  The  main  safety 
concern  is  the  association  of  cabergoline  with  increased  prevalence  of  irreversible  cardiac  valve 
insufficiency. 
In  summary,  while  some  evidence  of  efficacy  has  been  reported  with  these  agents  in  patients  with 
Cushing’s disease the data is limited. Furthermore, attenuation of effect and adverse effects limit the 
Page 9/90
 
 
 
usability  of  these  agents.  Thus  there  is  an  unmet  medical  need  in  the  treatment  of  patients  with 
Cushing’s diasease. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Signifor contains the active substance pasireotide, as diaspartate. For other ingredients see the SmPC. 
The  product  is  formulated  as  a  solution  for  injection  in  glass  ampoules  in  the  concentrations  of  0.3 
mg/ml, 0.6 mg/ml and 0.9 mg/ml.  
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Pasireotide  is  a  novel  synthetic  cyclohexapeptide  containing  the  amino  acids  lysine,  D-tryptophane, 
phenylglycine,  aminoethylcarbamoylhydroxyproline,  phenylalanine  and  O-benzyltyrosine,  with 
molecular  formula  C58H66N10O9  ·  2  C4H7NO4.  Pasireotide  free  peptide  contains  7  assymetric  carbon 
atoms (chiral centres) and there is also one chiral centre in aspartic acid.  
The  active  substance  is  an  amorphous  white  to  slightly  greyish  powder.  Molecular  mass  is  1313.41. 
The active substance is freely soluble in water, very slightly soluble in ethanol and acetone, sparingly 
soluble in methanol and insoluble in acetonitrile and isopropylalcohol.   
The  structure  of  pasireotide  diaspartate  was  confirmed  by  elemental  analysis,  and  several 
spectroscopic techniques.  
Manufacture 
Pasireotide diaspartate is manufactured by a solid-phase synthesis. The manufacturing process is well 
described.  The  starting  materials  are  sufficiently  characterised,  specifications  and  testing  procedures 
being  acceptable.  For  major  phases  of  the  synthesis  of  the  active  substance,  appropriate  in-process 
controls are in place.   
Descriptions of the possible impurities which may arise from the route of synthesis and/or storage of 
the drug substance have been presented. This includes structure, origin and methods of analysis, LOD, 
LOQ and the proposed limit in the specification for the drug substance. 
Page 10/90
 
 
 
 
 
Specification 
The active substance is tested for appearance, clarity and colour of the solution, identity by IR and RP-
HPLC,  related  substances  and  assay  by  RP-HPLC,  aspartic  acid  by  ion  chromatography,  amino  acid 
analysis,  residual  solvents  by  GC,  water,  sulphated  ash,  specific  optical  rotation,  heavy  metals, 
microbial  purity  and  endotoxins.  The  analytical  methods  are  suitable  for  testing  the  chosen 
specification parameters and were appropriately validated. 
Detailed  information  on  impurities  was  provided.  Impurity  limits  are  in  line  with  the  Ph.Eur.  general 
monograph  for  substances  for  pharmaceutical  use,  criteria  applicable  to  synthetic  peptides.  The 
specification limits for the impurities were also justified by toxicology studies and found safe.  
Batch analysis results were provided for  development and  commercial batches. All results conform to 
specifications. The reference standard has been appropriately characterised.  
Stability 
Stability  studies  have  been  performed  on  three  batches  of  the  active  substance:  long  term  studies, 
accelerated testing and stress testing.  
For the test parameters monitored during the stability studies, the acceptance criteria and methods are 
the same as for release testing. 
Stability  results  generated  under  the  above  long  term  and  accelerated  conditions  were  all  within  the 
set  specifications.  As  a  result  of  stressed  testing  performed,  the  active  substance  was  found  to  be 
sensitive to light and hygroscopic.  
Based on stability studies, a retest period for the active substance has been established. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Signifor  is  provided  as  solution  for  injection  in  glass  ampoules,  0.3  mg,  0.6  mg  and  0.9  mg  per 
ampoule. The volume of the solution in each ampoule is 1 ml. Each ampoule contains an overfill of 0.1 
ml, to allow withdrawal of 1 ml of the solution from the ampoule. In addition to the active substance, 
the product contains mannitol as tonicity agent, tartaric acid as buffering agent, sodium hydroxide for 
pH adjustment and water for injections as solvent. All excipients are of pharmacopoeial quality.  
Pharmaceutical Development 
Initial  formulations  in  strengths  of  0.15  mg/3  ml  (0.05  mg/ml)  and  3.0  mg/3  ml  (1.0  mg/ml)  were 
prepared as solution for injection in vials. The formulation was optimized after initial Phase 1 studies in 
strengths  0.1  mg/ml,  0.2  mg/ml,  0.3  mg/ml,  0.6  mg/ml  and  0.9  mg/ml  as  a  solution  for  injection  in 
ampoule.  Numerous  studies  investigating  different  pasireotide  salts,  various  pH  ranges  for  the 
formulation and several buffer systems were performed.  
Adventitious agents 
Pasireotide  diaspartate  is  a  fully  synthetic  active  substance.  No  starting  materials,  raw  materials  or 
reagents are of human or animal origin.    
There are no excipients of human or animal origin used in the finished product. 
Therefore, there is no risk of BSE/TSE transmission via this product.  
Page 11/90
 
 
 
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process for Signifor 0.3 mg, 0.6 mg and 0.9 mg solution for injection is a standard 
process  for  parenteral  formulations.  In-process  controls  are  in  place  during  manufacture  of  the 
product.  The  manufacturing  process  has  been  validated  It  has  been  demonstrated  that  the 
manufacturing  process  robustly  and  consistently  yields  a  product  capable  of  meeting  the  predefined 
quality characteristics. 
Product specification 
The  release  and  shelf-life  specification  of  the  finished  product  covers  appropriate  parameters  for  the 
dosage  form.  The  product  is  tested  for  appearance  of  the  container  and  the  solution,  identity  by  TLC 
and  RP-HPLC,  assay  and  degradation  products  by  RP-HPLC,  pH,  extractable  volume,  visible  and 
subvisible particles, bacterial endotoxins and sterility. Several degradation products were identified in 
the product; they are included in the specification, with limits corresponding to ICH Q3B guideline. The 
shelf-life specification is the same as for release. The specification and control tests are in compliance 
with general pharmacopoeial standards and ICH/EU guidelines.  
The analytical methods have been satisfactorily described and validated.   
Batch  results  on  production  batches  of  each  dosage  strength  were  presented.  All  results  comply  with 
the specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability  studies  were  conducted  on  several  batches  of  the  finished  product  in  glass  ampoules.    The 
product  was  stored  at  the  following  conditions:  long  term  (RH),  intermediate  and  accelerated  and 
stress conditions. 
No significant changes were observed at long-term conditions The product is sensitive to light.  
The results of stability studies support the shelf-life and storage conditions as defined in the SmPC. 
2.2.4.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and the finished product 
has  been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory 
consistency  and  uniformity  of  important  product  quality  characteristics,  and  these  in  turn  lead  to  the 
conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.  
2.2.5.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
In  the  context  of  the  obligation  of  the  MAHs  to  take  due  account  of  technical  and  scientific  progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
The Applicant is recommended to re-assess the limits set for residual heavy metals after more 
experience in commercial manufacturing is gained. This re-assessment could be envisaged after having 
data available for additional batches of Pasireotide diaspartate. 
Since the current packaging (glass ampoules) is not considered optimal by the CHMP, the Applicant is 
recommended to further develop and submit an application seeking approval of pasireotide solution for 
injection in pre-filled syringes as soon as appropriate stability data are available.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GLP aspects 
Safety pharmacology studies were performed according to GLP principles apart from three studies (RD-
2010-50430,  RD-2010-50370,  0419101),  for  which  sufficient  justifications  have  been  provided. 
Pharmacokinetic  (ADME)  studies  were  not  GLP-compliant,  but  in  line  with  standard  operation 
procedures, protocols, and/or current scientific standards. All pivotal non-clinical toxicity studies were 
performed  in  accordance  with  GLP  principles  except  two  reproduction  toxicity  studies  (HRA  2914-446 
and HRA 2914-447). The absence of GLP compliance does not affect the conclusions that can be drawn 
from these studies.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
Binding  of  pasireotide  in  vitro  to  somatostatin  receptor  subtypes,  sst1-sst5,  as  well  as  functional 
analysis  has  been  performed  using  cells  expressing  human  recombinant  somatostatin  receptor 
subtypes and mouse pituitary AtT20 cells expressing native somatostatin receptors. Comparisons have 
been made to octreotide (Sandostatin), a substance that binds primarily to sst2, but also to sst3 and 
sst5 with lower affinity, while the affinity to sst1 and sst4 is very low, and SRIF-14, which is a natural 
somatostatin or ”somatotropin release inhibiting factor”.  
In vitro studies 
Competition  binding  experiments  showed  that  pasireotide  binds  with  high  affinity  to  human 
somatostatin receptor subtypes hsst1, hsst2, hsst3, and hsst5. The affinity for hsst1 and hsst5 is 30 to 
40  times  higher,  and  the  affinity  to  hsst3  5  times  higher  than  the  affinity  of  octreotide,  while  the 
affinity for hsst2 was somewhat lower to octreotide. 
Functional  activity  at  human  recombinant  somatostatin  receptor  subtypes  showed  pasireotide  to  be  a 
full  agonist,  with  nanomolar  or  subnanomolar  potency  at  hsst1,  hsst2,  hsst3  and  hsst5  receptor 
subtypes. Pasireotide had no agonistic activity at the hsst4 receptor subtype, which is in line with the 
above  mentioned  binding  data.  Furthermore,  when  investigated  at  somatostatin  receptors  in  mouse 
pituitary TtT20 cells, a high (nanomolar) affinity for somatostatin receptors and an agonistic action was 
demonstrated in vitro. 
The  inhibitory  effect  of  pasireotide,  SRIF-14  and  octreotide  on  ACTH  release  was  investigated  in  cell 
culture  experiments  using  human  adenoma  tissue  and  mouse  AtT20  corticotroph  adenoma  cells. 
Pasireotide and SRIF-14 inhibited ACTH secretion in human adenoma cells and suppressed basal ACTH 
production in AtT20 cells, whereas octreotide had no effect. 
A pivotal study investigated the effect of pasireotide on ACTH secretion and cell proliferation of primary 
human  pituitary  corticotroph  adenomas  obtained 
from  13  patients  with  Cushing’s  disease 
demonstrating that human pituitary corticotroph adenomas display all somatostatin receptor subtypes 
except  for  subtype  3.  Furthermore,  pasireotide  has  ability  in  vitro  to  suppress  cell  proliferation  and 
inhibit ACTH secretion at concentrations approximately at clinical relevant levels.

In vivo study 
There are no relevant animal models available for Cushing’s disease. An in vivo study on the effect of 
pasireotide on CRH-stimulated secretion of ACTH and corticosterone has been performed in adult male 
Sprague-Dawley  rats.  On  day  1,  animals  were  pretreated,  i.v.,  with  either  pasirotide  (1,  3  or  10 
μg/kg), octreotide (10 μg/kg) or 0.9% NaCl 0.9% for one hour. The rats were then injected i.v. with 
CRH  0.5μg/kg  to  stimulate  the  secretion  of  ACTH  and  corticosterone.  The  study  demonstrates  that 
pasireotide  in  vivo  has  a  stronger  inhibitory  effect  on  ACTH  and  corticosterone  secretion  than 
octreotide in rats. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies demonstrated that consistent with its high in vitro binding affinity 
for sst2 and especially sst5, pasireotide inhibits the GHRH-induced GH release from primary cultures of 
rat  pituitary  cells.  In  vivo  in  rats,  pasireotide  inhibited  unstimulated  GH  release  and  caused  a  dose-
dependent decrease in plasma IGF-1 levels following s.c. infusion of 1, 10 or 50 µg/kg/h of pasireotide 
for 7 days. In rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys, pasireotide is also a strong inhibitor of GH and IGF-1. 
The ID50 of pasireotide for the inhibition of GH in Rhesus monkey was 0.4 µg/kg s.c and thus similar to 
the values obtained in rats.  
Pasireotide  caused  a  marked  increase  in  plasma  glucose  concentration  1  hour  after  s.c.  injection  of 
≥10 µg/kg in rats. In contrast, no increase in glucose was observed after injection of the same or even 
up to 50-fold higher doses of octreotide. Doses of pasireotide ≤1 µg/kg, which inhibit GH in vivo (ED50 
=  0.2  µg/kg  s.c.),  did  not  alter  basal glucose  levels.  The  increase  in  glucose  was  primarily  seen  with 
short term application of pasireotide in rats, but not in monkeys. Transient increases in plasma glucose 
have also been observed in clinical studies with Cushing’s patients.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
Safety pharmacology studies were performed in accordance with the ICH S7A and S7B guidelines. In a 
receptor screening assay, low binding affinity was detected to opiate kappa (0.041 μM), ghrelin (0.15 
μM), 5HT1A (0.31 μM) and opiate µ (0.42 μM) receptor binding sites which might indicate potential off 
target effects. However, the binding affinity for sst5 (the main target for Cushing’s disease) was 0.16 
nM  indicating  that  off  target  effects  of  pasireotide  via  these  four  receptors  at  clinical  doses  of 
pasireotide  is  probably  of  minor  importance.  Furthermore,  there  were  no  findings  in  the  non-clinical 
safety studies or in clinical trials that can be explained by actions via these receptors.  
Cardiovascular in vitro studies demonstrated no inhibition of hERG tail currents. No adverse effects on 
QT  interval  prolongation,  interference  with  cardiac  ion  channels,  blood  pressure  or  on  the 
electrocardiogram  have  been  observed.  Pasireotide  when  administered  subcutaneously in  male  albino 
rats  had  no  treatment-related  effects  on  respiratory  function.  However,  safety  pharmacology  studies 
carried out to assess the interference with potassium cardiac KCNQ1 and Kv3.4/Kir3., sodium (Nav1.5) 
and  calcium  (Cav1.2)  channels,  as  well  as  the  rabbit  Purkinje  fiber  assay  were  not  conducted  under 
GLP  conditions.  The  Applicant  warrants  that  the  lack  of  GLP  status  did  not  have  an  impact  on  the 
integrity of the results, a view which is accepted by the CHMP. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No  pharmacodynamic  drug  interaction  studies  have  been  performed  with  pasireotide,  which  is 
acceptable. 
Page 14/90
 
 
 
 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics or toxicokinetics of pasireotide were determined in mice (CD-1, CB6F1/TgrasH2 
and CB6F1/Jic-TgrasH2@Tac), rats (Wistar), rabbits (New Zealand White), dogs (Beagle) and monkeys 
(Cynomolgus).  Absorption,  distribution,  metabolism  and  excretion  of  pasireotide  were  studied  in  rats 
and monkeys using subcutaneous and intravenous dosing. 
Pasireotide was rapidly and almost completely absorbed (84-100%) after subcutaneous administration 
in rats, monkeys and humans. Pasireotide was cleared with half-lives, ranging from approximately 1.3 
hours in rats, 59 hours in monkeys and 8 hours in humans. The elimination of the radioactive half-life 
was  much  longer  in  rats,  monkeys  and  humans  (39,  187  and  211  hours,  respectively), but  since  the 
contribution  of  the  terminal  phase  to  the  total  AUC  was  only  7-20%  (depending  on  the  dose),  the 
effective  apparent  half-life  in  human  was  estimated  to  be  ~12  hours  for  doses  of  0.6-1.5mg. 
Bioavailability was estimated to be 100% in animals.  
Pasireotide  related  radioactivity  was  widely  and  similarly  rapidly  distributed  in  pigmented  and  non-
pigmented rats. The highest concentrations were found in the kidney, cartilage (blood vessel wall, ear 
and  esophagus),  lymph  nodes,  spleen  and  liver.  Radioactivity-derived  material  was  eliminated  slowly 
with total radioactivity in the carcass at 1, 3 and 14 weeks post-dose representing 29%, 14% and 2% 
of the dose, respectively, indicating a potential for drug accumulation. It is also noted that drug-related 
radioactivity remained at significant levels in several endocrine tissues (in addition to adrenals) where 
pasireotide is likely to be pharmacologically active (e.g. pituitary gland, pancreas). The passage of the 
blood-brain  barrier  was  minimal  and  there  was  no  specific  retention  in  melanin  rich  tissue.  Placental 
transfer and distribution to the fetus was shown in rats and rabbits. Pasireotide was excreted into milk 
in  rats.  Pasiretotide  was  shown  to  be  moderately  bound  to  plasma  proteins  in  all  species  tested 
including human with binding of 94%, 93% and 88% in rat, dogs and humans, respectively. 
The metabolism of pasireotide (0.2-0.5 mg protein/mL, 0.15-0.38 µM) was studied in vitro using liver 
microsomes  of  rat,  cynomolgus  monkey  and  human,  hepatocytes  of  rat  and  human  kidney 
microsomes. The only metabolite shown was a NADPH-dependent metabolite in monkeys, the structure 
of  which  could  not  be  determined.  The  metabolism in  vivo  of  pasireotide  in  rat,  monkey,  and  human 
following a s.c. dose was very limited with only a few minor metabolites detected. In the monkey, the 
primary  metabolic  pathway  was  formation  of  metabolite  M27,  an  oxidative  product  followed  by 
deamination  on  the  lysine  moiety  of  pasireotide.  This  metabolite  was  not  detected  in  other  species 
including  humans.  Unchanged  pasireotide  was  the  major  circulating  component  in  the  plasma  of  rat 
(93-95% of AUC), monkey (93% of AUC), and human (100% of AUC). 
The main route of excretion in rats and monkeys was via the faecal route (approximately 88%).  
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Toxicological  and  toxicokinetic  studies  have  been  performed  in  mice,  rats,  rabbits  and  monkeys  to 
support  the  administration  of  pasireotide  aspartate  (tested  mostly  as  base  where  salt/base  ratio  is 
1.25).  These  studies  include  acute,  subchronic  and  chronic  toxicity  studies,  carcinogenicity  studies  in 
transgenic  mice,  local  tolerance  studies,  reproduction  studies,  as  well  as  in  vitro  and  in  vivo 
genotoxicity studies. Most of these studies were performed using the subcutaneous route which is the 
proposed route of administration in patients. In addition, oral and i.v. administration routes were used 
in rats and monkeys.  
Page 15/90
 
 
 
Single dose toxicity 
Acute  toxicity  studies  were  performed  in  rats  and  mice  via  the  subcutaneous  route  with  a  maximum 
dose of 30 mg/kg (corresponding to 30 ml/kg as the maximum practical volume) which was non-lethal. 
In mice, pasireotide only induced crusts at the injection site in one female and no other adverse effects 
were  observed.  In  rats,  sores  were  noted  on  the  application  area  of  all  females  at  15  mg/kg  and  all 
animals at 30 mg/kg. Loss of body weight was observed during the first week following treatment. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Pasireotide has been studied in repeat–dose toxicity studies in mice (up to 4 weeks via the s.c. route), 
rats (up to 26 weeks, 2 weeks and 1 week via the s.c., i.v. and oral routes), dogs (up to ≤one week 
via  the  s.c.  route)  and  monkeys  (up  to  39  weeks,  2  weeks  and  2  weeks  via  the  s.c.,  i.v.  and  oral 
routes). The highest doses chosen in the repeat-dose toxicity studies via the subcutaneous route were 
30 mg/kg for 4 weeks in mice (s.c), 4 mg/kg (b.i.d.) for up to 2 weeks in rats, 5 mg/kg (b.i.d.) for 2 
weeks in dogs and 8 mg/kg (as salt) up to 4 weeks in monkeys. The mortality rate after subcutaneous 
doses of pasireotide was low in mice and rats, and none of the monkeys died. Dogs were shown to be 
the most sensitive species for the adverse effects of pasireotide showing signs of severe GI symptoms. 
Cynomolgus monkey was used as a non-rodent species further to the results of a 2-week study in dogs 
showing  poor  gastro-intestinal  tolerability  of  pasireotide  at  low  exposure  levels.  According  to  the 
Applicant, this is related to an exaggerated pharmacological activity of pasireotide since somatostatin 
is known to increase intestinal transit, which is endorsed. 
Subcutaneous administration of pasireotide by both twice daily (b.i.d.) and once daily (o.d.) regimens 
caused  similar  adverse  findings  and  hence  the  once  daily  s.c.  administration  route  was  chosen  in  the 
chronic toxicity studies.  
There  is  some  evidence  that  the  dose  levels  used  in  repeat-dose  toxicity  and  carcinogenicity  studies 
conducted  in  rats  were  rather  low  since  they  induced  mainly  effects  related  to  the  pharmacological 
activity  of  pasireotide  on  the  neuro-endocrine  system  at  low  exposure  levels.  In  addition,  they  were 
considerably lower than the dose levels used in reproduction toxicity studies. This issue was discussed 
by the Applicant and it is still considered by the CHMP that higher doses could have been used in the 
6-month  rat  study,  and  in  the  rat  carcinogenicity  study.  Nevertheless,  the  toxicological  profile  of 
pasireotide could be defined from the available toxicity studies. In addition, the concern on dose levels 
administered to rats is counterbalanced by the high specificity of pasireotide for sst receptors (notably 
sst5)  and  high  exposure  ratios  reached  in  monkeys.  Regarding  the  carcinogenicity  study,  in  spite  of 
rat-to-human  exposure  ratios  reaching  6.5  in  females  and  13.7  in  males,  this  can  be  considered 
acceptable  taking  also  into  account  the  lack  of  genotoxic  potential  and  results  obtained  in  the  short-
term mouse carcinogenicity study at higher animal-to-human exposure ratios. 
Targets of toxicity after subcutanous administration of pasireotide 
Generally, decreases in body weight gain and food consumption were noted in mice, rats and monkeys 
receiving  subcutaneous  doses  of  pasireotide.  The  LOAEL  effects  for  the  effects  on  the  body  weight  in 
mice  and  rats  were  below  the  expected  clinical  exposure  level  based  on  both  Cmax  and  AUC.  These 
effects were  observed in monkeys at exposure levels of 4.6x and 1.1x the expected clinical exposure 
based on Cmax and AUC, respectively. 
The other main target organs of toxicity identified after a subcutaneous dose were local damage of the 
skin  at  the  injection  sites  (all  species  used  in  the  toxicology  studies),  pituitary  (rats  and  monkeys), 
thyroid  (monkeys),  pancreas  (mice  and  rats),  bone  (rodents),  liver  (mice  and  rats),  female 
reproductive  organs  (mice  and  rats),  lymphoid  and  hematopoietic  organs  (mice,  rats  and  monkey), 
vasculature (rats and monkey) and large intestine (monkey).  
Page 16/90
 
 
 
Injection site 
Irritation of the skin at the injection site was evident in all species used in the repeated dose toxicity 
studies. These changes consisted of inflammation (chronic partially active dermatitis), fibrotic changes, 
hyperkeratosis, hypertrichosis, ulceration and necrosis of the skin and underlying tissue at the injection 
site  in  mice  at  the  LOAEL  of  0.2  mg/kg/day.  In  rats,  subcutaneous  redding  at  the  injection  site, 
inflammation  scab,  alopecia,  fibrosis,  edema,  necrosis,  minimal  to  moderate  mineralization  and 
regeneration  of  skeletal  muscle  myofibers  and  regeneration  of  the  panniculus  muscle  at  the  injection 
site 
and 
underlying 
tissues  was 
observed 
at 
the 
LOAEL 
of  0.008  mg/kg/day.  
In  monkey  studies,  swelling,  redness,  edema,  inflammation,  haemorrhages,  granulation  tissue, 
fibroplasias at the injection site and degradation/regeneration of subcutaneous skeletal muscle at the 
LOAEL of 0.5 mg/kg/day b.i.d.) were also shown. These effects in mice, rats and monkeys are shown 
at  lower  exposure  levels  compared  to  the  roughly  estimated  clinical  exposure.  However,  effects  at 
injection site have been observed in patients receiving pasireotide and there is a warning for these side 
effects in the SmPC.  
Effects on the neuroendocrine system correlated to the pharmacology of pasireotide 
Inhibitory effects on the hypophysis, resulting in lower pituitary weight (rats) and a decrease in size of 
the somatotrophs or decreased (mice, rats) /increased (monkeys) acidophil cells of the pituitary were 
shown  in  the  repeat  dose  toxicity  studies.  The  LOAEL  for  the  effects  on  the  acidophil  cells  of  the 
pituitary  was  2.5  mg/kg/day  in  mice  (higher  exposure  levels  than  the  roughly  estimated  clinical 
exposure), 0.008 mg/kg/day in rats (corresponds to lower exposure levels than the roughly estimated 
clinical  exposure)  and  1.6  mg/kg/day  (monkeys).  The  LOAEL  for  the  decrease  in  pituitary  weight  in 
rats was 0.8 mg/kg/day. 
In the pancreas in rats and mice, increased zymogen granules were observed which was not correlated 
with  any  other  findings  in  the  pancreas.  The  LOAEL  for  the  effects  on  pancreas  was  shown  to  be  2.5 
mg/kg/day for mice and 0.01 mg/kg/day b.i.d in rats. The changes in zymogen content were reversible 
after dose termination. 
In thyroid decreased weight was observed in studies where monkeys were treated for 4 and 39 weeks 
with  the  LOAEL  doses  of  2  and  0.5  mg/kg/day,  respectively.  In  both  studies  these  changes  were 
correlated to histopathological changes of attenuated follicular epithelium and small follicles with foamy 
cytoplasm in follicular epithelium in thyroidea. 
The changes in pituitary, pancreas and thyroid are caused by the pharmacology of pasireotide and are 
known as clinical side effects of somatostatin analogues and are covered in the SmPC sections 4.4 and 
4.8. 
Effects on bone growth including decreased bone formation at the level of the epiphyseal plate of the 
long  bones  were  observed  only  in  rodents.  These  effects  could  be  due  to  the  inhibitory  effects  of 
pasireotide  on  the  secretion  of  GH  from  the  pituitary  and  is  thus  considered  to  be  a  pharmacological 
effect.  
An  increase  in  serum  aspartate  and  alanine  aminotransferase  activity  and  a  decrease  in  both  total 
serum  protein  and  globulin  were  observed  in  both  mice  and  rats,  indicating  adverse  effects  of 
pasireotide  on  the  liver.  No  histopathological  correlates  for  these  changes  were  found  in  the  liver. 
Decrease  in  liver  weight  and  glucagon  and  bilirubin  levels  were  shown  in  rats  with  a  LOAEL  of  0.05 
mg/kg/day  (corresponding  to  0.5  and  0.05x  the  roughly  estimated  clinical  exposure  levels  based  on 
Cmax  and  AUC,  respectively).  In  rats,  an  increase  in  coagulation  parameters  such  as  PT,  APTT  and 
fibrinogen  at  LOAEL  of  0.024  mg/kg/day  (corresponding  to  0.2x  and  0.09x  the  roughly  estimated 
clinical  exposure  levels  based  on  Cmax  and  AUC,  respectively)  in  females  only,  were  also  shown. 
Decreases  in  cholesterol,  triglycerides  and  -1  globulin  have  also  been  shown  in  rats.  These  effects 
Page 17/90
 
 
 
could be secondary to the effects of changes of pituitary GH production by pasireotide and resulting in 
changes in the hepatic lipid metabolism and production of coagulation factor. In any case, a transient 
increase in the liver enzymes and coagulation factors has been shown in the clinic and measurements 
of  these  enzymes  are  recommended  before  and  during  treatment  with  Signifor,  which  is  reflected  in 
the SmPC section 4.4.  
In  female  reproductive  organs,  prolongation  of  estrus  cycle  was  observed  in  females  treated  with 
pasireotide  for  2  weeks  at  5  mg/kg  (rabbit)  and  at  doses  ≥  0.08  mg/kg  for  26  weeks  (rat),  which 
correspond  approximately  to  60x  and  1x  the  intended  clinical  exposure  based  on  Cmax  and  24x  and 
0.3X  based  on  AUC,  respectively.    Morphological  changes  of  the  ovary  (interstitial  cell  hyperplasia, 
minimal  to  slight  decrease  in  weight  and  decreased  number  of  corpora  lutea)  and  genital  tract 
(presence  of  fluid  in  the  uterine  horns  and  uterus  dilatation  and  by  hypertrophy  with  mucification  of 
the superficial cell layers of the vagina) were also observed at the end of 26 weeks.  
The reproductive changes were totally or partially reversible. The inhibitory effects seen on the female 
genital  tract  and  estrus  cycles  in  rat  studies  are  considered  to  result  from  the  pasireotide-induced 
decrease in IGF-1 and GnRH and LH, which causes ovulation and estrus not to occur. It is not known 
whether pasireotide has an effect on human fertility. 
Adverse  effects  in  lymphoid  and  hematopoietic  organs  in  the  order  they  developed  were  decreased 
lymphoid cellularity in spleen in rats at 0.01 mg/kg/day, decreased WEC in rats at 0.024 mg/kg/day, 
decreased  reticulocytes,  thymus  weight  and  bone  marrow  depression  in  rats  at  0.05  mg/kg/day, 
decreased  hematopoietic  activity  in  spleen  in  rat  at  0.5  mg/kg/day,  increased  RBC,  haemoglobin  and 
hematocrit  in  rats  at  1  mg/kg/day  b.i.d,  bone  marrow  depression  in  monkeys  at  2  mg/kg/day, 
decreaed thymus and spleen weight in rats at 5 mg/kg/day, decreased thymus weights in mice at 10 
mg/kg/day and decreased RBC, hematocrit and haemoglobin in mice at 30 mg/kg/day. The first signs 
of  adverse  effects  on  the  hematopoietic  and  lymphoid  organs  were  at  doses  which  gave  rise  to 
exposure  levels  below  the  intended  clinical  exposure  based  on  both  Cmax  and  AUC.  In  monkeys, 
decreased cellularity in bone marrow was observed starting at 2 mg/kg/day  which correspond to 42x 
and  17x  the  intended  clinical  exposure  based  on  Cmax  and  AUC,  respectively.  The  effects  of 
pasireotide  on  the  lymphoid  organs  and  hematopoiesis  are  believed  to  be  related  to  the 
pharmacological  properties  of  the  somatostatin  analogues  specifically  due  to  the  binding  of  these 
compounds  to  the  receptors  of  hematopoietic  precursor  cells  (CD34+  cells),  monocytes  and 
lymphocytes  inhibiting  the  proliferation  of  these  cells.  The  function  of  lymphoid  and  hematopoietic 
organs should be closely monitored in patients, which is reflected in the SmPC. 
Vascular  effects  shortly  after  administering  rats  with  subcutaneous  doses  of  5  mg/kg  of  pasireotide 
consisted of red tail tip, red feet and ears. After approximately 10 days, swollen ear, muzzle and feet 
and  tail  were  observed.  The  effects  on  muzzle  appeared  at  lower  doses  in  twice  daily  administration 
regimen compared to once daily. In monkeys, facial redness was observed after an intravenous dose of 
0.135  mg/kg/day.  These  effects  are  considered  to  be  secondary  to  the  vasodilatory  effects  of 
pasireotide  being  a  somatostatin  analogue  with  release  of  nitric  oxide  as  the  known  class  effect. 
Bradycardia  has  been  reported  as  a  common  adverse  effect  for  patients  receiving  pasireotide. 
Interestingly  PK  distribution  studies  with  radioactive  pasireotide  in  rats  have  shown  high  tissue  to 
blood  concentration  for  the  blood  vessel  wall  based  on  both  Cmax  and  AUC.  The  SmPC  section  4.4 
includes a warning for prescribing pasireotide in patients with cardiac disease. 
As mentioned above, adverse effects on the gastrointestinal tract have been observed in dogs, which 
showed  to  be  the  most  sensitive  species  with  signs  of  severe  GI  symptoms  that  ultimately  lead  to 
discontinuation  of  dosing  of  these  animals.  Gastrointenstinal  disorders  such  as  diarrhea,  nausea  and 
vomiting have frequently been reported in patients receiving pasireotide and a warning of these effects 
are  given  in  the  SmPC  section  4.8.  In  monkeys,  however,  distension  of  the  large  intestine  with  firm 
Page 18/90
 
 
 
fecal material was present in 1-4 monkeys in each dose group of the 4- and 39-week studies. Hence, 
the  adverse  GI  effects  in  monkeys  do  not  correspond  directly  to  the  effects  reported  in  patients 
receiving pasireotide, such as diarrhea (very common) and vomiting (common).  
Effects  on  kidneys  and  excretion  parameters  consisted  of  decrease  in  kidney  weight  (mice  at  10 
mg/kg/day)  and  some  minor  changes  in  the  excretion  parameters  (increase  in  urea,  creatinine, 
phosphorous  and  decreased  pH  in  the  urine)  in  rats  at  doses  ≥0.24  mg/kg/day  and  in  mice  ≥20 
mg/kg/day  were  observed  without  any  histopathological  changes  in  the  kidneys.  These  changes  are 
considered to be prerenal azotemia that occurs when the volume or pressure of blood flow through the 
kidney  drops  which  ultimately  results  in  a  decrease  in  kidneys  filtration  rate.  The  drop  in  the  renal 
blood  flow  is  a  likely  effect  of  pasireotide  since  somatostatin  analogues  cause  vasodilatation  and 
reduction in blood pressure thus affecting highly perfused organs such as kidneys.  
Adverse effects shown using other routes of administration 
Intravenous route, rats were dosed up to 4.5 mg/kg (one dose only) and monkeys up to 0.15 mg/kg 
for  2  weeks).  Intravenous  administration  of  pasireotide  by  bolus  injection  at  a  dose  of  4.5  mg/kg  in 
one  rat  only  was  lethal,  due  to  severe  toxicity  causing  reduced  motor  activity,  recumbency,  rapid 
irregular  breathing,  cyanosis  (at  the  injection  site  and  generalized,  whole  body)  and  the  animal  was 
sacrificed 20 minutes after dosing. In the main study, cyanosis was shown to be dose dependent and 
started at the tip of the tail dose 0.05 mg/kg/day and after 3 doses corresponding to approximately 4x 
the intended clinical exposure based on Cmax. Cyanosis then progressed to the whole body at the dose 
0.15  mg/kg/day  which  corresponds  approximately  to  12x  and  0.9x  the  intended  clinical  exposure 
based on Cmax and AUC, respectively. Hypoactivity, swelling of snout and transient dyspnea were also 
shown after 2-3 days of dosing with 0.15mg/kg/day. In addition, erythema in the eye and recumbancy 
were observed. These effects of pasireotide (cyanosis, irregular breathing, reduced motor activity and 
recumbency)  in  rats  following  intravenous  administration  are  somewhat  concerning  since  the  effects 
start at low exposure levels based on both Cmax and AUC.  
The intravenous administration of pasireotide in monkeys did not cause any mortality. A dose of 0.075 
mg/kg  resulted  in  redness  of  the  face  and  recumbancy  /immobility  immediately  post-dose,  which 
corresponds  approximately  to  19x  the  intended  clinical  exposure  based  on  Cmax.  At  0.15  mg/kg, 
excitement  (3/3),  dilated  pupil  (1/3)  and  laboured  breathing  (1/3)  were  observed  which  corresponds 
approximately  to  40x  the  intended  clinical  exposure  based  on  Cmax.  The  reason  for  pasireotide 
induced  laboured  breathing  in  monkeys  is  not  clear.  However,  when  pasireotide  was  used  in  a 
telemetry  study  (study  010076,  safety  pharmacology  study)  in  monkeys  given  as  a  single 
subcutaneous dose of up to 2 mg/kg, no clinical signs were observed. To relate the dose in this study 
to  exposure  levels,  the  results  of  PK  study  (DMPK  (CH)  R01-01556)  were  used  where  the  exposure 
level after a subcutaneous dose of 1 mg/kg based was shown to be approximately 1217 ng/mg, which 
corresponds  approximately  to  27x  the  intended  clinical  exposure  based  on  Cmax. Showing  no  clinical 
signs  at  this  high  exposure  levels  is  rather  unexpected  since  the  cardiovscular  effects  such  as 
bradycardia  and  QT  prolongation  are  known  clinical  pharmacological  effect  of  somatostatin  analogues 
such  as  lanreotide,  octreotide  and  even  pasireotide.  The  lack  of  response  in  monkeys  makes  the 
suitability  of  this  species  as  a  non-rodent  species  for  evaluating  these  types  of  effects  in  preclinical 
studies questionable. The presence of the somatostatin receptor subtype 5 (SS5) in the heart, and the 
high  potency  of  pasireotide  for  this  receptor,  makes  this  organ  a  plausible  target  of  toxicity  for 
pasireotide.  
Oral  route:  Generally,  doses  chosen  for  the  studies  via  the  oral  route  of  administration  were  much 
higher  than  the  ones  given  by  the  subcutaneous  route.  The  highest  dose  of  pasireotide  given  by  the 
oral route of administration was up to 300 mg/kg for 4 weeks in rat and up to100 mg/kg for 2 weeks 
in monkeys. The MTD and lethal doses in rats were ≥80 mg/kg/day and 300 mg/kg/day, respectively

causing  decreased  body  weight,  poorly  responsive  behaviour,  recumbency  and  decreased  motor 
activity.  Since  the  inter-individual  variability  in  the  pasireotide  concentrations  in  both  clinical  and 
animal  studies  are  very  high,  the  comparison  of  exposure  levels  is  difficult.  However,  the  exposure 
levels  at  MTD  in  rats  (≥80  mg/kg/day)  were  far  below  the  well  tolerated  dose  of  100  mg/kg  in 
monkeys. Since the oral route of administration is not the intended route for patients, a discussion on 
the findings of these studies is not considered necessary.  
Genotoxicity 
Pasireotide  has  been  evaluated  for  its  potential  genotoxic  effects  in  bacteria,  mammalian cells  and  in 
rodents according to guidelines. The studies were performed according to GLP. 
In  the  Ames  test,  pasireotide  was  negative  in  the  presence  and  absence  of  metabolic  activation. 
Pasireotide did not induce structural chromosomal aberrations in human peripheral blood lymphocytes 
cells with or without metabolic activation.  The Micronucleus test was performed using male rats where 
the  doses  in  the  main  study  were  based  on  adequate  preliminary  dose  range  finding  studies  in  male 
and female rats. No genotoxic potential was observed in rats treated with pasireotide up to doses of 50 
mg/kg (subcutaneous administration). Bone marrow toxicity was observed at the highest tested dose.  
Carcinogenicity 
A carcinogenicity study in rats and a short-term carcinogenicity study employing TgrasH2 mouse were 
performed with pasireotide using the clinical administration route.  
In rats, doses of 0.01, 0.05 and 0.3  mg/kg/day pasireotide were administered subcutaneously for 24 
months.  The  results  of  clinical  pathology  examinations  performed  are  only  provided  on  an  individual 
animal  basis  in  the  study  report.  Pasireotide  did  not  induce  tumours  in  female  rats.  In  male  rats  a 
statistically  significant  treatment-related  increase  in  the  incidence  of  fibroma  (whole  body)  was 
observed  in  animals  treated  with  the  high  dose,  0.3  mg/kg/day.  An  increased  incidence  of 
fibroma/sarcoma  was  not  observed.  The  NOAEL  for  the  benign  fibroma  was  0.05  mg/kg/day,  which 
corresponds  to  an  exposure  comparable  to  the  intended  therapeutic  exposure.  It  is  possible  that  the 
finding  is  sporadic  as  the  Applicant  proposes,  however,  considering  the  three  cases  of  fibroma  at  the 
injection site at the high dose group, it is considered more likely that the benign tumours are caused 
by continuous irritation at the injection site. Irritation of the skin at the injections site is evident in all 
species in the repeat dose toxicity studies; thus the cases of fibroma at the injection site would not be 
unexpected. Adequate information has been included in the SmPC to ensure that the patients will not 
inject themselves at sites where skin reaction/inflammation is present.  
In CB6F1/TgrasH2 hemizygous mice doses of 0 (vehicle), 0.5, 1 and 2.5 mg/kg/day pasireotide were 
administred  subcutaneously  for  26  weeks.  CB6F1  wild-type  mice  were  treated  in  parallel  with  0 
(vehicle) and 2.5 mg/kg/day pasireotide. For the CB6F1/TgrasH2 hemizygous mice a positive control, 
N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (75 mg/kg, single i.p. dose on day 1) was included to ensure test sensitivity. 
The TgrasH2 mouse short-term carcinogenicity test is acceptable as valid as an alternative for the 24 
months  mouse  carcinogencity  study.  The  design  of  the  study  was  reasonable  and  included  a  positive 
control  which  induced  neoplatic  tumours.  The  results  from  the  26  week  study  with  TgrasH2  mice 
revealed no neoplastic lesions in the pasireotide treated animals. The NOAEL for this 26-week study is 
>2.5  mg/kg/day,  which  corresponds  approximately  to  20x  the  intended  clinical  exposure  based  on 
Cmax.  Similarly  to  the  rat  carcinogenicity  studies,  an  increased  incidence  in  subcutaneous 
inflammation,  hemorrhage,  fibrosis  and  regeneration  of  the  panniculus  muscle  at  the  injection  site 
were  seen  in  male  CB6F1/TgrasH2  mice  at  pasireotide  doses  of  ≥0.5  mg/kg/day  compared  to 
concurrent controls.

Reproduction Toxicity 
In  the  fertility  and  early  embryonic  development  study  in  rats,  subcutaneous  doses  of  up  to  10  mg 
base/kg/day  were  administrated.  Clinical  signs  consisted  of  decreased  food  consumption  and  body 
weight, swollen and red paws and noses and wounds with subsequent hair loss at the injection sites. In 
females  an  increased  incidence  of  prolonged  estrus  cycles/acyclicity  and  decreased  mean  numbers  of 
corpora  lutea  were  observed  from  0.1  mg/kg.  Effects  on  female  reproduction  were  also  seen  in  the 
repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  and  are  an  expected  pharmacological  effect  of  pasireotide  due  to  an 
induced  decrease  in  IGF-1.  IGF-1  is  crucial  to  the  priming  actions  of  estradiol  in  the  female 
reproductive cycle prior to ovulation. Pasireotide-related impairment of GH-IGF-1 axis may be involved 
in  the  induction  of  female  genital  tract  changes,  but  there  is  no  clear  and  absolute  understanding  of 
pasireotide’s effect on this pathway. 
Male reproductive parameters were not affected by treatment. The no adverse effect level (NOAEL) for 
males  was  set  to  10  mg/kg  which  corresponds  to  a  margin  to  human  exposure  of  approximately  10 
based  on  AUC  at  the  maximum  human  recommended  dose  (MHRD).  No  NOAEL  was  reached  for  the 
females. 
Embryo-foetal  development  was  studied  in  rats  and  rabbits,  with  subcutaneously  administered  doses 
up  to  10  mg/kg  and  5  mg/kg,  respectively.  In  rats,  apart  from  the  previously  seen  clinical  signs, 
increased  absolute  number  of  early/total  resorptions,  decreased  absolute  number  of  viable  foetuses 
and a slight increase in malrotated limbs were observed in combination with maternal toxicity, from 10 
mg/kg.  A  foetal  NOAEL  was  set  to  5  mg/kg,  corresponding  to  an  AUC(0-24h)  value  of  25594  ng*h/mL 
giving a margin to MHRD based on AUC of approximately 60. In rabbit, clinical signs were obvious from 
0.05  mg/kg  and  consisted  of  mucoid  and/or  no  stool  or  urine  and  decreased  food  consumption  and 
body  weight.  Concomitant  with  maternal  toxicity,  at  1.0  and  5.0  mg/kg,  a  decrease  in  foetal  weight 
and in the absolute number of viable foetuses was noted as well as an increase in unossified forepaw 
phalanx  and  talus.    Maternal  and  foetal  NOAEL  was  0.05  mg/kg/day,  corresponding  to  a  AUC(0-24h) 
value of 114ng*h/mL, giving no margin to MHRD based AUC.    
Prenatal  and  postnatal  development  including  maternal  function  was  studied  in  rats,  administered 
subcutaneous doses up to 10 mg/kg. The same clinical signs as observed previously were seen in the 
dams,  however,  maternal  performance  parameters  were  unaffected.  In  the  F1-generation  decreased 
body weight and a slight retardation in the development of pinna detachment were seen at 2 mg/kg. 
There  was  no  effect  on  visual  function,  physical  development,  behavioural  performance,  macroscopic 
findings, parental performance or uterine findings for the F1-generation adults. No NOAEL was reached 
for either generation in this study; the lowest dose of 2 mg/kg gives a margin to human exposure of 2, 
based on AUC. 
No  juvenile  toxicity  study  was  conducted  since  Signifor,  at  present  time,  is  indicated  for  adults  only, 
and this is acceptable. 
Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetic data have demonstrated a discrepancy between the exposure levels measured in rats at 
the high dose levels in the 26-week (0.24 mg/kg/day) and carcinogenicity (0.3 mg/kg/day) studies at 
the final time-points, i.e. week 22 and week 39, respectively. The exact cause of variability observed 
between both studies remains unknown. Some inter-study factors could be involved, or possibly other 
inter-study factors (e.g. variability in pasireotide concentrations in the dosing formulations). Exposure 
levels were measured in both studies, from which adequate safety margins were determined.  
Page 21/90
 
 
 
Based on the shown limited biotransformation of pasireotide in all species investigated, the relevance 
of the use of rat and monkey are supported. However, it should be noted that no GI or cardiovascular 
effects were seen in these species even at high exposure levels, which might have been expected for 
this somatostatin analogue. 
Local Tolerance  
The  performed  local  tolerance  studies  (ocular  irritation  and  skin  irritation/corrosion  in  the  rabbit) 
demonstrated that pasirotide is non-irritating to rabbit skin but slightly irritating to the eye. However, 
as was seen in the repeated dose toxicity studies, pasireotide causes irritation at the injection site in all 
animal species investigated.  
Other toxicity studies 
A  4-week  immunotoxicity  study  in  the  rat  with  pasireotide  0.08,  0.24  and  0.8  mg/kg/day  has  been 
performed.  In  the  study  lymph  node  cell  counting  was  performed  using  a  non-validated  instrument 
(Guava  automatic  counter),  thus  not in  compliance  with  GLP.  The  applicant indicates  that  there is  no 
impact  on  the  integrity  of  the  results  based  on  a  comparison  assessment  with  the  validated  manual 
method  (study  no.  27523)  performed  prior  to  the  main  study,  a  view  which  is  endorsed. 
Histopathological examination of the bone marrow and lymphoid tissues (spleen, thymus and selected 
lymph nodes) demonstrated in females at 0.8 mg/kg/day and in males at doses of ≥0.08 mg/kg/day 
minimal  to  slight  hematopoietic  hypocellularity  and  increased  adipose  tissue  in  the  bone  marrow. 
Decreases  in  splenic  total  lymphocyte  counts  and  absolute  counts  of  all  lymphocyte  subpopulations 
analyzed were observed in males dosed at 0.24 and 0.8 mg/kg/day. Neither the anti-KLH IgM nor the 
anti-KLH IgG responses were affected by pasireotide treatment. The conclusion of the CHMP is that a 
minimal effect of pasireotide on the immune system was observed in the performed immunotox study.  
The Applicant has presented an acceptable argumentation for acceptance of impurities and degradation 
products and specification limits of pasireotide aspartate, which is endorsed by the CHMP. 
The  phototoxicity  study  performed  indicated  no  phototoxic  potential  for  pasireotide.  The  Applicant  in 
agreement  with  the  OECD  test  guideline  432  decided  that  no  further  investigations  were  deemed 
necessary, a view that is shared by the CHMP. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The  predicted  environmental  concentration  (PEC)  for  pasireotide  is  0.000035  μg/L,  which  remains 
below the trigger value of 0.01 μg/L.  
Based  on  its  pharmacological  activity,  pasireotide  should  be  considered  as  a  potential  endocrine 
disruptor.  As  such,  and  in  accordance  with  the  guideline  on  the  environmental  risk  assessment  of 
medicinal  products  for  human  use  (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00),  its  potential  effects  on  the 
environment  should  be  addressed  irrespective  of  the  quantity  released  into  the  environment. 
Consequently, the fact that phase I PECSURFACEWATER is below the action limit does not preclude the 
need  for  additional  investigations.  The  Applicant  acknowledges  that  pasireotide  should  be  tested 
further  in  view  of  its  effects  on  the  endocrine  system.  The  Applicant  considers  that  the  amphibian 
metamorphosis  assay  (OECD  TG  No.  231)  is  the  most  appropriate  test  to  investigate  the  potential 
endocrine  disruptor  activity  of  pasireotide.  This  is  justified  by  the  drug-induced  effects  on  the 
hypothalamo-pituitary  axis,  which  were  mainly  seen  on  growth.  Although  pasireotide  was  shown  to 
affect  the  growth  of  rats  in  a  reproducible  manner,  effects  on  reproduction  cannot  be  excluded  due 
possibly to drug-induced effects on the GH-IGF-1 pathway. 
Page 22/90
 
 
 
The  amphibian  metamorphosis  assay  is  primarily  focused  on  the  detection  of  substances  which  may 
interfere  with  the  normal  function  of  the  hypotalamo-pituitary-thyroid  axis  since  amphibian 
metamorphosis  is  a  thyroid-dependent  process.  Although  thyroid  findings  were  not  reported  in  any 
toxicity  study  conducted  in  rodents  (including  carcinogenicity  studies  in  mice  and  rats),  some  were 
observed  in  monkeys  and  were  graded  minimal  to  slight  (small  follicles).  Therefore,  this  assay  is 
considered  appropriate  to  detect  any  effect  related  to  disruption  of  the  HPT  axis.  However,  this  test 
would be of limited value to detect effects on growth. Therefore, the Applicant is recommended to also 
perform  a  juvenile  Fish  Early  Life-Stage  study  according  to  OECD  210  to  investigate  the  potential 
effects on growth, hatchability, fry survival and abnormal change in eggs and fry.

In  the  context  of  the  obligation  of  the  MAHs  to  take  due  account  of  technical  and  scientific  progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
1.  The amphibian metamorphosis assay; 
2.  Fish Early Life-Stage study according to OECD 210; 
3.  OECD 308 test in line with the ERA guideline. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Non-clinical competition binding experiments showed that pasireotide binds with high affinity to human 
somatostatin receptor subtypes hsst1, hsst2, hsst3, and hsst5. The affinity for hsst1 and hsst5 is 30 to 
40  times  higher,  and  the  affinity  to  hsst3  5  times  higher  than  the  affinity  of  octreotide,  while  the 
affinity  for  hsst2  was  somewhat  lower  and  equal  to  octreotide.  Thus,  the  binding  data  demonstrates 
that  the  mechanism  of  action  for  pasireotide  is  somewhat  different  from  that  of  octreotide,  mainly 
regarding affinity to the hsst5 receptor subtype. Both in vitro and in vivo data give support for the use 
of pasireotide in the proposed indication. 
Page 23/90
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  pharmacokinetics  of  pasireotide  is  uncomplicated.  Rats  and  monkeys  are  the  species  used  in  the 
pivotal repeated dose toxicity studies and based on the shown limited biotransformation of pasireotide 
in all species used, the relevance of the use of rat and monkey are supported by the CHMP. However, 
it  should  be  noted  that  no  GI  or  cardiovascular  effects  were  seen  in  these  species  even  at  high 
exposure levels, which might have been expected for this somatostatin analogue. 
Most findings seen in repeated toxicity studies could be attributed to the pharmacology of pasireotide 
being  a  somatostatin  analogue.  The  somatostatin  neuropeptide  family  and  its  receptors  have  an 
important  physiological  role  in  a  wide  variety  of  biological  functions  in  many  tissues  such  as 
neuroendocrine, vascular, immune, gastrointestinal and reproductive systems. Hence the effects were 
mostly centered on these systems, which in large also have been noted in clinical trials with pasirotide. 
Overall, the toxicity profile regarding effects on the neuroendocrine system is expected for this class of 
compounds.  The  sensitivity  of  rats  exposed  to  pasireotide  has  however  been  shown  to  be  lower  than 
the known clinical GI effects of somatostatin analogues. In the safety pharmacology and repeated dose 
toxicity  studies,  monkeys  did  not  show  the  typical  clinical  cardiovascular  symptoms  of  exposure  to 
somatostatin  and  its  analogues,  even  when  the  monkeys  were  exposed  to  high  levels  of  pasireotide 
based on Cmax and AUC. Additionally, the adverse GI effects of distention of the large intestine with 
firm fecal material induced after exposure to pasireotide in monkeys were not typical of those shown in 
patients  who  commonly  show  diarrhea  and  vomiting.  Therefore,  the  suitability  of  monkeys  as  a  non-
rodent species for evaluating these types of effects in preclinical studies is considered questionable. 
The genotoxicity of pasireotide has been adequately studied and the weight of evidence is sufficient to 
conclude  that  pasireotide  is  not  genotoxic.  Pasireotide  is  not  carcinogenic  in  mice  using  the 
CB6F1/TgrasH2  model  or  in  female  rats.  In  male  rats,  there  were  three  cases  of  benign  fibroma 
probably due to sustained toxic irritating effect at the injection site in the high dose group. Irritation of 
the skin at the injections site is evident in all species in the repeat dose toxicity studies, thus the cases 
of  fibroma  at  the  injection  site  would  not  be  unexpected.  Adequate  information  has  been  included  in 
the  SmPC  to  ensure  that  the  patients  will  not 
inject  themselves  at  sites  where  skin 
reaction/inflammation is present.  
Pasireotide did not affect male fertility, but caused prolonged estrus cycles/acyclicity and a decreased 
mean  numbers  of  corpora  lutea  in  females  due  to  the  pharmacological  activity.  Embryo  toxicity  at 
maternally toxic doses was seen in rat and rabbit, but no teratogenic potential was detected in these 
two  species  under  the  study  conditions.  A  slight  retardation  in  the  development  of  pinna  detachment 
and  reduced  foetal  body  weight  were  observed  in  the  prenatal-  postnatal  development  study.  In  the 
embryo-foetal  study  in  rabbits  and  in  the  prenatal-postnatal  study  in  rats,  the  effects  were  seen  at 
similar exposures as reached in humans after MHRD. In the fertility and embryo-foetal studies in rats, 
the  margins  to  maximum  human  exposure  varied  between  10-60  times.  These  findings  have  been 
correctly reflected in the SmPC.  
The  predicted  environmental  concentration  (PEC)  for  pasireotide  is  0.000035  μg/L,  which  remains 
below  the  trigger  value  of  0.01  μg/L.  Pasireotide  cannot  be  considered  as  readily  biodegradable. 
Therefore,  in  accordance  with  the  guideline  on  the  environmental  risk  assessment  of  medicinal 
products  for  human  use  (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00)  the  CHMP  is  recommending  the  applicant  to 
undertake  a  study  according  to  OECD  308.  Furthermore,  based  on  its  pharmacological  activity, 
pasireotide  should  be  considered  as  a  potential  endocrine  disruptor.  In  accordance  with  the  guideline 
on

for

use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00),  in  addition  to  the  amphibian  metamorphosis  assay  suggested  by  the 
Applicant,  the  Applicant  is  recommended  to  perform  also  a  Fish  Early  Life-Stage  study  according  to 
OECD  210  to  investigate  the  potential  effects  on  growth,  hatchability,  fry  survival  and  abnormal 
change in eggs and fry.

2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Pasireotide is a somatostatin receptor agonist with a slightly different affinity to somatostatin receptors 
compared  to  octreotide.  Non-clinical  safety  data  reveal  no  special  hazard  for  humans  based  on 
conventional  studies  of  safety  pharmacology,  repeated  dose  toxicity,  genotoxicity  and  carcinogenic 
potential,  toxicity  to  reproduction  and  development.  Most  findings  seen  in  repeated  toxicity  studies 
were reversible and attributable to the pharmacology of pasireotide. Effects in non-clinical studies were 
observed  only  at  exposures  considered  sufficiently  in  excess  of  the  maximum  human  exposure 
indicating little relevance to clinical use. 
Although  toxic  effects  noted  in  repeat  dose  toxicity  studies  in  rats  could  largely  be  explained  by  the 
mechanism  of  action  of  pasireotide,  monkeys  did  not  show  the  typical  clinical  cardiovascular  and  GI 
symptoms of exposure to somatostatin and its analogues, which makes the suitability of monkeys as a 
non-rodent  species  for  evaluating  these  types  of  effects  in  preclinical  studies  questionable.  However, 
no serious concerns for human safety have been detected in the non-clinical safety studies.  
The Applicant is recommended to perform an additional in vitro study assessing the inhibitory effect of 
pasireotide  on  a  P-gp  substrate,  preferably  with  another  cell  model  than  Caco-2,  with  a  view  to 
understand the usefulness of performing in vivo studies  
The  Applicant  is  recommended  to  further  investigate  the  potential  mechanisms  of  cardiovascular 
effects of pasireotide as follows: 
1.  A study to explore the effects of pasireotide on additional cardiac ion channels using FASTPatch 
assay. 
2.  A  study  examining  the  expression  profile  of  somatostatin  receptor  subtypes  in  cardiac  tissues 
across species. 
3.  A study to evaluate the effects of pasireotide on hERG-channel trafficking.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Introduction 
The  clinical  pharmacokinetics  (PK)  have  been  investigated  in  healthy  volunteers  and  in  patients 
(Cushing’s disease). In study SOM230C2101, a long acting depot formulation was used, and this study 
is  therefore  not  assessed  in  this  report.  Several  population  PK  models  have  been  developed,  one 
initially on healthy volunteers and eventually two population PK models were developed based on data 
from patients with Cushing’s disease. Of notice is that all healthy volunteer studies with PK assessment 
included  only  male  subjects,  apart  from  the  QTc  study  (SOM230B2113).  Exposure-response  models 
were developed for UFC, QTc and blood glucose.  
The  pharmacokinetic  features  of  pasireotide  have  been  investigated  following  subcutaneous 
administration in healthy volunteers following single (1 to 1500 µg) and repeated doses (50 to 600 µg 
qd over 14 days, 900 to 2100 µg qd for 5 days). In addition, plasma concentrations were measured in 
Cushing’s disease patients following 600 µg bid up to 15 days using a rich sampling schedule. Sparse 
data  was  collected  in  the  phase  3  study  (B2305)  following  600  and  900  µg  bid  up  to  12  months. 
Plasma concentrations were measured using a radioimmunoassay method and the data were analysed 
by means of non-compartmental and/or population PK methods.  
Pasireotide  solution  for  injection  is  an  aqueous  solution  containing  the  drug  substance  pasireotide 
diaspartate  formulated  in  a  buffer  system.  The  composition  of  the  product  and  strengths  used  in  the 
pivotal study supporting this application is identical to the intended market form. 
Page 26/90
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Absorption 
The  absolute  bioavailability  following  subcutaneous  administration  has  not  been  estimated,  which  is 
acceptable.  
In healthy volunteers, following a subcutaneous dose pasireotide is rapidly absorbed and peak plasma 
concentration  is  reached  within  0.25-0.5 h.  Cmax  and  AUC  are  approximately  dose-proportional 
following  administration  of  single  and  multiple  doses  and  plasma  concentrations  decline  tri-
exponentially. Following the highest recommended dose (900 µg bid) maximum plasma concentrations 
in patients are predicted to 45 ng/mL on average but due to variability individuals may exhibit levels of 
70 ng/mL. 
Distribution 
In  study  R99-2082  the  protein  binding  of  pasireotide  was  investigated  in  vitro  through  ultrafiltration 
using  [14C]pasireotide.  The  %recovery  in  the  experiments  was  estimated  to  be  around  70%  and 
independent  of  the  studied  concentration,  indicating  sticking  to  the  filtrate.  The  bound  fraction  was 
found to be on average 883% in human plasma from three individuals over the concentration range 
25 -10000 ng/mL, without a clear concentrations dependence. The free fraction varied between 8.2 to 
16.9%. In the same study, the in vitro distribution of [14C]pasireotide to red blood cells was studied in 
human blood through cell separation by centrifugation and was observed to be very low with fraction in 
plasma of 913% over the concentrations range 100 – 10000 ng/mL. The Cb/Cp was 0.60.05. 
Thus, in healthy volunteers, pasireotide is widely distributed with large apparent volume of distribution 
(Vz/F  >100 litres).  Distribution  between  blood  cells  and  plasma  is  concentration  independent  and 
shows  that  pasireotide  is  primarily  located  in  the  plasma  (91%).  Plasma  protein  binding  is  moderate 
(88%) and independent of concentration. 
The  available  data  indicate  that  the  free  fraction  may  be  around  0.1  but  this  value  contains  some 
uncertainty. The binding protein in plasma has not been identified. 
Based on in vitro data pasireotide appears to be a substrate of efflux transporter P-gp (P-glycoprotein). 
Based  on  in  vitro  data  pasireotide  is  not  a  substrate  of  the  efflux  transporter  BCRP  (breast  cancer 
resistance  protein)  nor  of  the  influx  transporters  OCT1  (organic  cation  transporter 1),  OATP  (organic 
anion-transporting polypeptide) 1B1, 1B3 or 2B1. Pasireotide is also not an inhibitor of OATP, 1B1 or 
1B3. 
Elimination 
In study SOM230B2112 a single subcutaneous injection of [14C]pasireotide (600 μg) was administered 
to  healthy  male  subjects  (n=4).  For  all  four  subjects,  >48%  of  the  administered  dose  radioactivity 
(566.6%  of  dose)  was  recovered  within  10  days  post  dose.  Pasireotide-related  radioactivity  was 
mainly excreted in the faeces, accounting for 38.1–57.2% of the dose elimination (488.2% of dose), 
with  renal  excretion  route  accounting  for  7.62.03%  of  dose.  Based  on  the  metabolite  profiling  of 
excreta  and  plasma,  excretion  of  unchanged  pasireotide  was  considered  to  be  a  major  elimination 
route at least within the period 168 hours post dose. 
Pasireotide  appears  to  be  metabolically  stable  with  little  metabolism  occurring  and  no  metabolites  in 
the systemic circulation. In vitro  data show that pasireotide  is not a substrate, inhibitor or inducer of 
any major enzymes of CYP450. In healthy volunteers, pasireotide is predominantly found in unchanged 
form in plasma, urine and faeces. 
Page 27/90
 
 
 
The  main  elimination  pathway  is  hepatic  clearance  (biliary  excretion)  and  this  pathway  has  been 
roughly  estimated  to  account  for  approximately  86%  of  the  dose,  predominantly  in  the  form  of 
unchanged drug. The only identified transporter protein involved in the biliary excretion appears to be 
P-gp.  Pasireotide  contains  6  chiral  carbon  atoms  and  stereochemical  inter-conversion  in  vivo  is 
unlikely.  
In addition, a small part of the elimination of pasireotide is via the renal route. In a human ADME study 
55.9±6.63%  of  the  radioactive  dose  was  recovered  over  the  first  10 days  after  administration, 
including 48.3±8.16% of the radioactivity in faeces and 7.63±2.03% in urine. 
Pasireotide demonstrates low clearance (CL/F ~6.7 litres/h for healthy volunteers and ~3.8 litres/h for 
Cushing’s disease patients). Based on the accumulation ratios of AUC, the calculated effective half-life 
(t1/2,eff) in healthy volunteers was approximately 12 hours. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Over the studied dose range there may be a slight trend of a decreasing apparent clearance at doses 
above  the  highest  recommended.  Over  the  recommended  dose  range  600  to  900  g  b.i.d.  the  lower 
dose will result in a lower systemic exposure and the decrease is roughly in proportion to dose. On the 
basis of the healthy volunteer data there is no time dependency indicted and an effective half-life of 12 
hours was estimated.  
Pharmacokinetic data in patients indicate that patients have a lower apparent clearance, approximately 
half of that observed in healthy volunteers. No obvious reasons for this difference have been identified. 
In Cushing’s disease patients, pasireotide demonstrates linear and time-independent pharmacokinetics 
in the dose range of 0.3 mg to 1.2 mg twice a day.  
Population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  suggests  that  based  on  Cmax  and  AUC,  90%  of  steady  state  in 
Cushing’s  disease  patients  is  reached  after  approximately  1.5  and  15 days,  respectively.  Therefore, 
steady-state is expected to be reached within 2 weeks in patients. The variability in observed pre-dose 
pasireotide levels in patients ranged from 40-70% CV. 
Special populations 
Children 
No studies have been performed in paediatric patients. 
Impaired renal function 
There was no effect of mild renal impairment on the systemic exposure of pasireotide. Data in patients 
with  moderate  and  severe  renal  impairment  are  lacking,  but  an  effect  is  not  expected  in  moderate 
impairment since the main elimination route is biliary excretion. However, it may not be excluded that 
the biliary excretion is affected by severe renal impairment.  
Impaired hepatic function 
A study in hepatic impairment revealed an increase of 60% and 79% in AUC in moderate and severe 
hepatic  impairment,  respectively,  compared  with  the  control  group.  A  lower  initial  dose  is 
recommended in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment, which is satisfactory. 
Elderly 
Age has been found to be a covariate in the population pharmacokinetic analysis of Cushing’s disease 
patients.  Decreased  total  body  clearance  and  increased  pharmacokinetic  exposures  have  been  seen 
with increasing age. In the studied age range 18-73 years, the area under the curve at steady state for 
Page 28/90
 
 
 
one dosing interval of 12 hours (AUCss) is predicted to range from 86% to 111% of that of the typical 
patient  of  41 years.  This  variation  is  moderate  and  considered  of  minor  significance  considering  the 
wide age range in which the effect was observed. There is however limited data above the age of 73 
years  and  it  is  expected  that  low-weight  elderly  persons  may  exhibit  higher  systemic  exposure  than 
patients of higher body weight and lower age. 
Gender, race and weight 
There  is  no  effect  of  sex  on  the  systemic  exposure  of  pasireotide.  With  respect  to  race,  there  are  no 
data  available.  Effects  of  body  weight  and  age  on  the  systemic  exposure  were  identified  in  the 
population  PK  analyses;  pasireotide  exposure  increased  with  increasing  age  and  decreasing  body 
weight,  respectively.  For  a  range  of  60-100 kg  the  reduction  in  AUCss  with  increasing  weight  is 
predicted  to  be  approximately  27%,  which  is  considered  moderate  and  of  minor  clinical  significance. 
Further, in view of the overall variability, these effects appeared to be of little clinical relevance.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Based  on  in  vitro  inhibition  studies  it  is  considered  unlikely  that  pasireotide  would  inhibit  CYP1A2, 
CYP2B6,  CYP2C8,  CYP2C9,  CYP2C19,  CYP2D6,  CYP2E1,  CYP3A4/5  in  vivo.  In  vitro  data  are  not 
conclusive  concerning  inhibition  of  P-gp  by  pasireotide,  and  the  Applicant  is  recommended  to 
complement  these  data  with  an  in  vitro  study  assessing  the  inhibitory  effect  of  pasireotide  on  a  P-gp 
substrate, preferably with another cell model than Caco-2. Furthermore, pasireotide is not expected to 
induce enzymes regulated via the Ah receptor, CAR or PXR.  
No  drug  interaction  studies  have  been  performed  in  vivo  and  in  general  the  interaction  potential  for 
pasireotide  appears  low  since  there  are  no  strong  indications  that  pasireotide  would  inhibit  or  induce 
enzymes or transporter proteins. Furthermore, pasireotide is mainly excreted unchanged via bile.  
P-gp  seems  to  be  the  only  transporter  that  is  likely  involved  in  the  distribution  and/or  elimination  of 
pasireotide. Since biliary excretion is a major elimination pathway for pasireotide, the consequence of 
an inhibition of this pathway is of importance. From a clinical perspective, the P-gp inhibitor verapamil 
can be anticipated to be co-administered with pasireotide. Therefore, the Applicant is recommended to 
perform  a  clinical  interaction  study  assessing  the  effect  of  the  strong  P-gp  inhibitor  verapamil  on 
pasireotide pharmacokinetics. 
Pasireotide  may  decrease  the  absorption  of  cyclosporine  by  an  unknown  mechanism.  A  cautionary 
statement  suggesting  that  dose  adjustment  of  cyclosporine  may  be  required  upon  concomitant 
administration has been introduced into the SmPC, which is considered sufficient. 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials  
The clinical pharmacology package contains several human biomaterial studies (permeability in Caco-2 
cell  monolayers,  blood  distribution,  plasma  protein  binding,  biotransformation  and  drug-drug 
interactions using human liver microsome and hepatocytes). The relevant results are discussed above. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Pasireotide  (SOM230)  is  a  novel,  injectable,  somatostatin  analogue  with  a  different  receptor  binding 
profile than either octreotide or lanreotide.  
Page 29/90
 
 
 
In  contrast  to  other  somatostatin  analogues  (SRIFa),  pasireotide  has  a  high  affinity  to  4  of  the  5 
known human sst subtypes (sst 1, 2, 3, and 5), thereby resulting in a binding profile that is closest to 
date  to  natural  somatostatin.  As  compared  with  octreotide,  pasireotide  exhibits  a  30-40  times  higher 
binding affinity for sst1 and sst5, 5 times higher binding affinity for sst3, and a comparable (0.4-fold) 
affinity for sst2. Pasireotide inhibits ACTH secretion from human corticotropin adenomas in vitro with a 
greater effect than octreotide, potentially due to the higher binding affinity for the sst5 receptor, which 
is  thought  to  play  an  important  role  in  Cushing’s  disease.  Several  lines  of  functional  pre-clinical  data 
derived from rats, AtT20 cells and human corticotroph adenoma cells support this assumption. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology 
Somatostatin  is  a  hormonal  peptide  that  regulates  the  endocrine  system.  These  principal  effects  are 
the  inhibition  of  the  release  of  GH  and  TSH,  the  suppression  of  the  release  of  gastrointestinal 
hormones  (such  as  gastrin,  secretin,  cholecystokinin)  and  pancreatic  hormones  (inhibition  of  the 
insulin  and  glucagon  release).  Thus,  by  its  mechanisms  of  action  as  analogue  of  somatostatin, 
pasireotide may lead to the same inhibition process.  
Main efficacy assessments in patients with Cushing’s disease were determined by urinary-free cortisol 
(UFC) as the primary endpoint, while serum cortisol and plasma ACTH were chosen as the secondary 
endpoints.  Since  the  effect  of  pasireotide  was  only  investigated  in  patients  with  Cushing’s  disease, 
these data will be discussed in the efficacy section of this report. 
Although the primary target for pasireotide is inhibition of ACTH secretion, ACTH measurement in the 
evaluation  of  pasireotide  efficacy  is  not  feasible  due  to  the  rapid  degradation  of  ACTH  in  plasma.  In 
patients with Cushing’s disease UFC is a surrogate measure for ACTH activity and UFC is accepted as a 
screening test in Cushing’s disease. By applying 24 hour collections and calculation of the mean of two 
or  three  consecutive  collections  the  variability  is  decreased.  The  choice  of  UFC  was  endorsed  by  the 
CHMP. 
Urinary-free cortisol (UFC) response in Cushing’s disease patients 
Exposure-response analyses of UFC versus measures of pasireotide plasma concentrations revealed a 
tendency of a relationship, but the analyses do not provide a firm support for the choice of dose. 
Secondary pharmacology 
Study  B2101  was  a  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  parallel-group,  ascending  single 
dose  study  exploring  the  tolerability,  PK  and  PD  in  72  healthy  volunteers.  The  doses  investigated 
ranged between 1 and 1200 μg. 
In  this  single-dose  study,  pasireotide  did  not  show  any  effect  on  food-induced  changes  in  glucose, 
CKK,  and  insulin  levels  23  hours  post-dose.  The  GHRH  test  (performed  between  2  to  5  hours  post-
dose) demonstrated the ability of single doses of pasireotide to suppress the release of GH.  
This effect started to be observed at doses of 30 μg, showing a clear suppression in the 200 μg dose 
group  and  near  maximal  effects  at  600  to  1200  μg,  in  which  range  it  approached  an  upper  plateau 
region in the dose-response and exposure-response curves. 
Study B2102 was a placebo-controlled randomized, cross-over, double-blind, dose-escalating study to 
evaluate safety, tolerability, PK and PD in 33 healthy volunteers. Doses investigated were 50, 200 and 
600 μg b.i.d. over 14 days. 
Page 30/90
 
 
 
When  repeated  doses  were  given,  glucose  levels  were  elevated  both  prior  to  and  after  a  meal  in 
subjects  receiving  600  μg  pasireotide,  but  this  effect  was  less  prominent  on  Day  14  than  on  Day  1. 
Post-prandial insulin levels until 1 hour post-lunch were elevated after 600 μg.  
Glucagon, gastrin, and thyroid hormones were not significantly affected at any dose. 
Gallbladder  volume  was  increased  post-prandially  at  both  200  and  600  μg,  and  this  appeared  to  be 
correlated  with  reduced  levels  of  CCK  at  these  doses.  Increased  stool  fat  levels  were  observed  in 
subjects  receiving  200  and  600  μg/day.  Despite  reports  of  diarrhoea,  there  was  no  effect  on  overall 
stool weight at any dose.  
Pasireotide significantly inhibited GH-RH-stimulated GH secretion at doses of 200 and 600 μg/day, and 
an  average  pasireotide  concentration  of  approximately  0.7  ng/mL  will  yield  half  of  the  maximal  GH 
reduction.  This  effect  did  not  undergo  tachyphylaxis  after  14  days  of  treatment,  as  the  effect  was 
similar on Day 1 and Day 14. 
These observed effects of pasireotide could be expected considering the mechanism of action.  
Blood glucose metabolism in healthy volunteers - Study B2216 
In Study B2216, a Phase II, double-blinded, single center study to assess the effects of pasireotide on 
insulin  secretion  and  glucose  metabolism  in  healthy  male  volunteers,  the  mechanistic  effects  of 
pasireotide  on  glucose  metabolism  was  examined  in  detail.  In  this  study,  subjects  were  randomized 
into  either  pasireotide  600  μg  b.i.d.  s.c.  or  900  μg  b.i.d.  s.c.  treatment  groups,  which  they  were 
treated with their respective pasireotide dose level for an 8-day period. 
Dose-response  data  obtained  in  this  study  revealed  the  rapid,  transient  increase  in  blood  glucose 
concentration after pasireotide s.c. b.i.d. treatment that was primarily related to a reduction in insulin 
levels  due  to  a  decrease  in  insulin  secretion.  No  changes  in  hepatic  or  peripheral  insulin  sensitivity 
were observed. In addition, pasireotide s.c. was also associated with a significant decrease in incretin 
response (i.e., glucagon-like peptide-1 [GLP-1] and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide [GIP]). 
Increases in blood glucose occurred with initial pasireotide exposure; however, this effect was followed 
by  a  rapid  attenuation,  after  which  the  normalization  of  blood  glucose  levels  was  reached  by  Day  7. 
The  effect  on  post-prandial  blood  glucose  levels,  while  transient,  was  more  pronounced  at  doses 
greater than 600 μg b.i.d. s.c.  
QTcF interval – Study B2113 and Study B2125 
A thorough clinical QT/QTc evaluation was conducted in 128 healthy volunteers to determine whether 
pasireotide  s.c.  at  the  maximum  tolerated  dose  (MTD)  has  an  effect  on  cardiac  repolarization,  as 
detected  by  QT/QTc  prolongation  (study  B2113).  In  this  study,  a  transient  QTcF  prolongation  was 
observed  with  pasireotide,  when  given  at  supra-therapeutic  doses  of  MTD  1950  μg  b.i.d.  Pasireotide 
showed a peak effect on QTcF at 2 hours post-dose. There was a +10.0 ms mean QTcF increase from 
baseline that equated to a 17.5 ms difference versus placebo. A similar effect was observed on QTcI, 
but no effect was observed on the QTcB interval. Pasireotide-treated subjects also showed a reduction 
of  the  heart  rate  at  0  to  4  hours  post-dose  with  the  maximum  change  versus  baseline  of  10.7  bpm. 
There were no outliers (> 60 ms change from baseline or new QTc > 500 ms) identified in this study.  
There was a positive correlation between ΔΔQTcF and pasireotide plasma concentration in the thorough 
QT  study.  The  maximum  plasma  concentrations  observed  in  that  study  may  well  be  observed  in  the 
clinical situation in patients following the highest recommended dose. 
The  results  from  the  thorough  clinical  QT/QTc  study  B2125  confirm  an  effect  of  pasireotide  on  QTc 
interval. 
Page 31/90
 
 
 
The  somatostatin  receptor  5  has  been  shown  to  be  expressed  in  human  heart  tissue.  After  review  of 
the literature the Applicant concluded that no conclusions to support a specific role of SSTR5 in cardiac 
tissue  can  be  drawn  due  to  paucity  of  data.  The  Applicant,  however,  is  recommended  to  explore 
whether  the  cardiac  effect  of  pasireotide  (bradycardia,  QT  prolongation)  pertain  to  any  explorable 
ancillary properties (If, somatostatin receptors) by mean of relevant models. 
Genetic polymorphism 
In  several  PK/PD  and  clinical  studies,  the  Applicant  has  collected  blood  and  urine  samples  to 
investigate the potential impact of genetic polymorphism of pasireotide’s properties related to the drug 
target, the somatostatin receptors (sst1-5), genes related to the mechanism of action, such as GH and 
somatomedin C (IGF-1) and those in drug metabolism genes. The results of these investigations have 
been  submitted  by  the  applicant.  No  formal  relationship  can  be  identified  between  the  responder  or 
non responder status and the genotype. However the Applicant has committed to further explore this 
issue in the RMP by an adequate complementary programme. 
Pharmacodynamics interactions 
Considering  the  effects  of  pasireotide  on  the  glucose  metabolism,  interactions  with  anti-diabetic 
medications  may  be  foreseen.  The  Applicant  has  submitted  the  results  from  study  B2124  which  was 
designed  to  define  the  potential  role  of  different  class  of  anti-hyperglycaemic  agents  in  the 
management  of  hyperglycaemia  induced  by  pasireotide.  The  pharmacodynamic  interaction  between 
pasireotide  and  metformin,  nateglinide,  vildagliptin  and  liraglutide  was  investigated.  The  most 
prominent antihyperglycaemic effect was observed with liraglutide and vildagliptin with the least effect 
observed for metformin. Serum insulin AUC0–4h on Day 7 increased by approximately 71% and 34% 
after  coadministration  of  pasireotide  with  vildagliptin  and  liraglutide,  respectively,  as  compared  to 
pasireotide  alone.  This  effect  was  mostly  achieved during  the  last  2  hours  of  the  4-hour  postprandial 
period,  whereas  almost  no  reversal  of  insulin  suppression  was observed  during  the  first 2  hours.  The 
safety  assessment  of  the  combination  therapies  revealed  no  unforeseen  adverse  events  and  the 
combinations  were  moderately  well  tolerated.  Notably  increases  in  hepatic  enzymes/bilirubin  were 
more  common  in  the  pasireotide  +  liraglutide  arm  indicating  that  this  may  not  be  a  favourable 
combination. 
With  reference  to  pharmacodynamic  interactions,  and  further  to  the  assessment  of  the  QT  studies,  a 
statement on the risk of bradycardia potentiation when this drug is combined with a bradycardic agent 
has been added to section 4.5 of the SmPC. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The  provided  clinical  pharmacokinetic  package  covers  in  general  the  main  issues.  However,  some 
further  studies  are  recommended  concerning  drug  interactions.  The  Applicant  investigated  whether 
pasireotide would be a substrate for several transporter proteins but the only identified is P-gp. Since 
co-administration  with ketoconazole  (P-gp  inhibitor)  may  be  expected,  the  Applicant is  recommended 
to perform an in vivo study with a strong P-gp (verapamil). Furthermore, the results from two in vitro 
studies concerning the inhibitory effect of pasireotide on P-gp point in different directions and it cannot 
be  concluded  that  pasireotide  is  not  a  P-gp  inhibitor.  Therefore,  the  Applicant  is  recommended  to 
perform an additional in vitro study.  
The mechanism of action for pasireotide has been adequately described. The different binding profile of 
pasireotide  compared  to  other  somatostatin  analogues  together  with  the  data  showing  that  sst5  is 
expressed by ACTH producing pituitary adenomas, make an effect in Cushing’s disease plausible.  
Page 32/90
 
 
 
The  pharmacological  effects  of  pasireotide  have  been  adequately  investigated.  Pasireotide  acts  by 
binding on 4 of the 5 known human sst receptors. The main markers of the pharmacological activity of 
pasireotide  are  linked  to  this  mechanism:  decrease  in  level  of  urinary  free  cortisol  in  24h,  serum 
cortisol or plasma ACTH. Another parameter of pharmacological effect of pasireotide, Growth hormone 
(GH) activity, has been measured in healthy volunteers by GHRH stimulation test. A careful follow-up 
of pituitary hormones values before and under treatment should be performed. Adequate information 
on this issue is mentioned in the SmPC.  
Pasireotide in the PD studies has demonstrated an impact on the blood glucose metabolism. In a study 
investigating  the  pharmacodynamic  interactions  between  pasireotide  and  metformin,  nateglinide, 
vildagliptin and liraglutide, respectively, the incretin enhancers were found to be most efficient in the 
treatment  of  pasireotide  induced  hyperglycaemia  with  the  least  effect  observed  with  metformin. 
Hepatobiliary  adverse  events  were,  however,  more  commonly  observed  with  the  pasireotide  + 
liraglutide combination. 
Two thorough QT/QTc studies have shown a QT prolonging potential of pasireotide. This is reflected in 
the SmPC; wording has been introduced to highlight the need for monitoring in the clinical setting. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetic profile of pasireotide has been sufficiently characterised. No major objections are 
identified regarding the pharmacokinetics, but the Applicant is recommended to perform some further 
studies for a further characterisation of the clinical pharmacology of pasireotide. 
The  secondary  pharmacodynamic  effects  observed  with  pasireotide  are  in  line  with  what  could  be 
expected for a somatostatin analogue. Two thorough QT studies indicate that pasireotide induces QT-
prolongation.  Adequate  warnings  in  this  regard  have  been  included  in  the  SmPC.  Warnings  regarding 
effects  on  glucose  metabolism,  other  hormones  such  as  thyroid  hormones  and  GH  as  well  as  cardiac 
effects are also included in the SmPC. In view of the effects of pasireotide on the glucose metabolism, 
interactions with anti-diabetic medications have been investigated. The incretin enhancers were found 
to  be  most  efficient  in  the  treatment  of  pasireotide  induced  hyperglycaemia  with  the  least  effect 
observed with metformin. Hepatobiliary adverse events were, however, more commonly observed with 
the  pasireotide  +  liraglutide  combination.  The  data  is  not  deemed  sufficient  to  make  any  specific 
treatment  recommendations  regarding  pasireotide  induced  hyperglycaemia  beyond  current  guidelines 
on  the  treatment  of  diabetes.  The  SmPC  includes  adequate  information  on  hyperglycaemia  including 
recommendations  concerning  follow-up  in  pasireotide-treated  patients  with  reference  to  glucose 
metabolism, i.e. before and under treatment as well as after discontinuation of treatment. 
The Applicant is recommended to perform a clinical interaction study assessing the effect of a strong P-
gp inhibitor, preferably verapamil, on pasireotide pharmacokinetics. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy  
The efficacy claims of this submission are supported by one pivotal study B2305. 
The  development  program  supporting  this  indication  (Cushing’s  disease)  consisted  of  one  additional 
study:  a  proof-of-concept  study  B2208  and  its  extension  B2208E1.  A  summary  of  these  studies  is 
provided in Table 2.

2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
No formal dose-response  study was performed. Instead the pasireotide dose  selected in study B2208 
was based upon data from healthy volunteer studies, i.e. study B2101, study B2102, study B2106 and 
study  B2107.  PK  simulation  analysis  predicted  that  the  peak  and  trough  levels  at  steady  state  were 
approximately 15 ng/mL and 2 ng/mL, respectively, at 600 μg b.i.d. s.c.. A concentration of 1 ng/mL 
was  thought  to  represent  the  minimally  required  level  of  pharmacologically  active  octreotide 
concentration for GH suppression in plasma. The same concentration was assumed to be necessary for 
suppression of ACTH by pasireotide. However, the higher plasma protein binding of pasireotide (88%) 
relative to octreotide (65%), which translates into approximately a 3-fold difference in free drug level, 
suggested  that  a  target  plasma  level  for  pasireotide  greater  than  1-2  ng/mL  would  be  more 
appropriate. Data from study B2106 in healthy volunteers showed that the tolerability/safety at 600 μg 
b.i.d. s.c. dose was acceptable; therefore, this dose was used in study B2208. Additionally, the b.i.d. 
regimen was chosen based on the effective half-life of pasireotide.  
Page 34/90
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Thus dose selection was largely based on assumptions and safety data. Since it is not feasible to study 
the pharmacological effects of pasireotide on ACTH and cortisol in healthy volunteers and proper dose 
finding  studies  in  Cushing’s  disease  are  not  feasible  due  to  the  rarity  of  the  disease,  this  strategy  is 
acceptable. 
Results  from  study  B2208  corroborated  the  theoretical  considerations  and  suggested  that  a  dose  of 
600 μg b.i.d. or higher was necessary to observe efficacy.  
2.5.2.  Main study(ies)   
Pivotal Study B2305 
Study B2305 was a 12-month Phase III, double- blind, randomized, multi-center study of 2 dose levels 
in  Cushing’s  disease  patients  performed  to  assess  efficacy,  safety,  QoL,  PK,  and  PK/PD  relationship. 
Primary  efficacy  analysis  was  performed  at  Month  6.  The  extension  period  of  the  study  is  currently 
ongoing.  
The  study  included  165  male  and  female  patients,  aged  18  years  and  above,  with  a  confirmed 
diagnosis  of  ACTH-dependent  Cushing’s  disease.  Patients  with  de  novo  Cushing’s  disease  could  be 
included  only  if  they  were  not  considered  candidates  for  pituitary  surgery  (e.g.  poor  surgical 
candidates, surgically unapproachable tumours, patients who refused to have surgical treatment). For 
patients  on  medical  treatment  for  Cushing’s  disease  a  washout  period  had  to  have  been  completed 
before  baseline  efficacy  assessments  were  performed.  Patients  with  a  known  history  of  impaired 
fasting glucose or diabetes mellitus (DM) could be included. Patients were to be excluded if they had 
received  pituitary  irradiation  within  the  last  ten  years.  Patients  with  symptomatic  cholelithiasis, 
uncontrolled diabetes, significant cardiac disease (including risk factors for torsade de pointes) or liver 
disease were also excluded. 
The study design for study B2305 is outlined in Figure 1 below. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio 
at baseline to receive pasireotide either 600 μg b.i.d. or 900 μg b.i.d. s.c. Randomisation and blinding 
procedures  were  adequate.  The  study  drug  was  self-administered  (subcutaneous  injections)  by  the 
patients. No comparator was included in the study since there is no approved or universally accepted 
medical  therapy  for  the  treatment  of  Cushing’s  disease.  Alternative  unapproved  therapies  are 
inadequate  for  long-term  treatment  due  to  the  high  incidence  of  side  effects.  Furthermore,  the 
availability  of  the  medications  used  in  the  management  of  hypercortisolism  is  not  consistent  across 
countries. Placebo was not deemed ethical for the time required for a clinical trial, given the morbidity 
associated  with  extended  state  of  hypercortisolism  and  other  clinical  symptoms  associated  with  this 
disease. 
At Month 3, patients continued at the randomised dose until Month 6 (double-blind treatment) if their 
Month 3 mUFC was a) ≤ 2 x ULN and b) below or equal to their baseline mUFC.  
Patients  not  meeting  these  mUFC  criteria  at  Month  3  were  unblinded  and  were  required  to  increase 
their  dose  by  300  μg  b.i.d.  with  a  maximum  daily  dose  of  2400  μg;  those  whose  dose  was  not 
increased had to be discontinued from the study. Patients who were unblinded and had dose-escalation 
at  Month  3  were  considered  non-responders  in  the  primary  efficacy  analysis,  regardless  of  their  UFC 
levels  at  Month  6.  For  patients  who  were  unable  to  tolerate  the  protocol-specified  dose  level,  dose 
reductions were permitted in order to keep the patient on study drug. During the double-blind phase, 
blinded lower doses were available for blinded dose-reductions. 
After six months of treatment, patients entered an open-label treatment period where they remained 
on  their  current  dose  level  provided  a  response  was  observed.  If  the  patient  did  not  respond,  or  the 
response was not maintained during the open-label treatment period, the dose could be increased by 
Page 35/90
 
 
 
300 μg b.i.d. to a maximum daily dose of 1200 μg b.i.d. Dose decrease by 300 μg b.i.d. was allowed 
any  time  for  lack  of  tolerability.  The  duration  of  the  core  study  was  12  months,  after  which  patients 
could enter an open-ended extension.  
Allowing dose-titration during the study provides information on the usefulness of up- or down-titration 
of pasireotide.

Primary objective and endpoint 
The  primary  objective  was  to  assess  the  efficacy  of  pasireotide  in  the  treatment  of  Cushing’s  disease 
expressed  as  the  proportion  of  responders  to  pasireotide  600  μg  s.c.  b.i.d.  and  900  μg  s.c.  b.i.d. 
independently  in  patients  with  Cushing’s  disease  as  measured  by  mean  UFC  ≤  upper  limit  of  normal 
(ULN) after 6 months of treatment. Thus, no formal comparison between the two doses was planned. 
The Applicant has justified this change in design as compared to the CHMP Scientific advice provided.  
A responder was defined as a patient with Month 6 mUFC ≤ ULN and no dose increase (relative to the 
randomized dose) prior to Month 6 UFC. If Month 6 mUFC was missing then it was imputed by the last 
available mUFC (of at least 3 specimens) between (and including) Month 3 up to Month 6. 
The proportion of responders in each dose group and overall was summarised using the point estimate 
and the 95% CIs. If the lower bound of the 95% CI for a dose group was greater than 15% then that 
dose group was considered to have a significant benefit in terms of UFC reduction. This is acceptable 
taking  into  account  the  seriousness  of  the  disease  and  the  fact  that  other  medications  used  in 
Cushing’s disease are not suitable for long-term treatment due to an unsatisfactory safety profile. 
Based  on  the  null  hypothesis  of  p  =  15%  and  alternative  hypothesis  of  p  =  30%,  enrollment  of  146 
patients  provided  87%  power  to  demonstrate  statistical  significance.  Based  on  these  calculations  a 
larger sample size than originally proposed was planned. 
Page 36/90
 
 
 
 
Prior  to  the  database  lock  and  unblinding,  supportive  analyses  using  the  following  clinical  response 
subgroups were defined in the analysis plan: 
Controlled responders: Month 6 mUFC ≤ ULN (regardless of dose increase). 
Partially  controlled  responders:  Month  6  mUFC  >  ULN  but  mUFC  declined  by  at  least  50%  from 
baseline,  regardless  of  dose  increase.  The  choice  of  50%  was  made  based  on  an  estimate  of  the 
variability  of a  single  sample.  This  was  estimated  via  the  within-patient  co-efficient  of  variation  to  be 
52%.  Thus, a  50%  reduction  from  baseline  was  considered  as  a  reasonable  indication of intervention 
effect. 
Uncontrolled: neither controlled nor partially controlled at Month 6. 
The  primary  objective  was  somewhat  changed  in  relation  to  the  CHMP  scientific  advice  in  that  only 
patients achieving a normalisation of UFC were considered responders, furthermore the endpoint was 
measured  at  six  months  instead  of,  as  initially  proposed,  three  months.  Since  these  changes  are 
conservative they are acceptable to the Committee.  
Secondary objectives and endpoints 
The  secondary  objectives  included  assessment  of  reduction  of  UFC  to ≤  1  x  ULN  at  Month  3  and  12, 
time  to  first  UFC  response,  the  effect  of  pasireotide  s.c.  on  plasma  ACTH  and  serum  cortisol  levels, 
improvement  in  clinical  signs  and  symptoms  of  Cushing’s  disease,  the  effect  of  pasireotide  s.c.  on 
tumour  volume  and  Quality  of  Life.  No  imputations  for  missing  values  were  made  for  the  secondary 
endpoints. 
Exploratory  efficacy  analyses  included  analysis  of  response  by  baseline  mUFC  category  and  clinical 
response status over time 
Additional  unplanned  efficacy  analyses  included  after  the  Month  12  database  lock  included 
predictability of non-response to treatment. Post-hoc analyses explored the relationship between mUFC 
and clinical signs and symptoms of Cushing’s disease by plotting mean mUFC values and the following 
parameters  over  time:  body  mass  index  (BMI),  weight,  HDL,  LDL,  total  cholesterol,  triglycerides, 
systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and HRQL scores. Summary statistics for these parameters were 
also provided. 
Results  
Participant flow  
Overall, 165 patients were randomized into this study, of which 3 did not receive study drug. These 3 
patients  were  screening  failures,  but  were  randomised  by  mistake.  Of  the  162  patients  who  were 
correctly randomized into the study, all were treated. One of the 162 randomized patients had a forced 
randomization: at the time of randomization, blinded drug packages were only available for one of the 
two  randomized  doses  at  the  site.  Thus,  the  IVRS  automatically  randomized  the  patient  to  that  dose 
for which blinded drug was available. 
Details of participant flow are given in Table 3. The proportions of the patients who completed Month 
12  were  similar  in  both  dose  groups,  but  more  patients  from  the  900  μg  b.i.d.  group  entered  in  the 
extension phase.  
Treatment discontinuations at any time up to data cut-off (including discontinuation prior to as well as 
after  the  end  of  the  core  study)  were  similar  in  both  dose  groups.  The  most  common  reasons  for 
discontinuation were unsatisfactory therapeutic effect, AEs and subject withdrew consent.

Note: % for the first three rows based on N. % for the remaining rows based on randomized and treated subjects. *Patients who completed Month 
12 and did not enter extension phase are not counted as discontinuations.  
Discontinuations due to AEs were most common at the beginning of treatment, whereas lack of effect 
became  more  common  later  on.  Patients  who  discontinued  were  considered  to  be  non-responders, 
therefore  the  discontinuations  are  not  considered  to  hamper  the  evaluation  of  the  primary  endpoint; 
however, the outcome of secondary endpoints will be less robust. 
Baseline data 
Baseline demographic data are presented below (Table 4). Considering the small size of the study, the 
two  study  groups  were  well  balanced  with  regards  to  the  baseline  demographic  characteristics.  The 
majority of patients were female which is to be expected in this patient group. Very few patients above 
the age of 65 were included.

  Disease history 
With the exception of baseline mUFC and previous medication for Cushing’s disease, the two treatment 
groups  were  well  balanced  in  terms  of  disease  characteristics  (Table  5).  The  median  time  to  the  first 
dose  of  pasireotide  since  diagnosis  of  Cushing’s  disease  was  34  months  and  ranged  from  0.1  to  372 
months.  The  disease  status  was  persistent/recurrent  for  the  majority  of  patients  in  both  treatment 
groups  (83.3%).  Few  patients  (≤  5%)  in  either  treatment  group  had  received  previous  pituitary 
irradiation.  Most  patients  (79.0%)  had  previous  surgical  intervention  for  the  treatment  of  Cushing’s 
disease. The use of previous medications for Cushing’s disease was slightly lower in the 600 μg b.i.d. 
group than the 900 μg b.i.d. group (43.9 vs. 52.5%). 
Page 39/90
 
 
 
 
Table 5 Disease history and baseline characteristics by randomized dose group (Full analysis 
set – Study B2305) 
The baseline mUFC was considerably higher in the 600 μg b.i.d. group when compared to the 900 μg 
b.i.d.  group  and  a  higher  proportion  of  the  patients  in  the  900  μg  b.i.d.  group  had  been  previously 
medically  treated.  The  wash-out  periods  applied  in  the  study  have  been  adequately  justified  and  it is 
unlikely that the previous medication had any influence on the outcome. 
Primary efficacy results 
The primary efficacy results are summarised in Table 6. Only the 900 μg b.i.d. dose met the primary 
efficacy  endpoint  as  the  lower  limit  of  the  95%  confidence  interval  for  the  pasireotide  900  μg  b.i.d. 
group  was  greater  than  the  pre-specified  null  hypothesis  of  15%.  It  has,  however,  to  be  taken  into 
account that baseline UFC values were lower in this dose group.

The  results  for  the  per-protocol  set  were  consistent  with  those  observed  in  the  FAS,  thus  supporting 
the results of the primary efficacy analysis.  
Page 40/90
 
 
 
 
 
 
From  a  theoretical  viewpoint  it  is  not  possible  to  claim  that  the  higher  dose  met  the  pre-specified 
threshold  of  15%  since  the  two  confidence  intervals  for  the  two  doses  in  study  B2305  are  presented 
without  adjusting  (as  suggested  in  the  study  protocol)  for  multiplicity  issues.  The  responder  rate 
(26.3 %) in the 900 μg b.i.d. group is, however, considered clinically relevant by the CHMP. 
When  analysing  the  primary  endpoint,  imputations  for  missing  values  were  made.  The  Applicant  has 
provided  information  on  the  number  of  values  imputed  and  also  provide  additional  analyses  without 
imputation. The results of the more conservative analysis excluding the imputated data do not change 
the overall conclusion on a relevant effect of pasireotide. No formal comparison was made between the 
two doses. 
Clinical response subgroup rates at Month 6 – supportive analysis 
The  results  of  clinical  response  subgroup  analyses  are  summarized  in  Table  7.  The  proportion  of 
controlled  UFC  responders  was  15.9%  and  28.8%  in  the  600  μg  b.i.d.  and  900  μg  b.i.d.  groups, 
respectively. In this analysis, patients who had had their dose increased at Month 3 were included as 
opposed  to  the  primary  analysis  where  only  patients  maintained  on  the  randomized  dose  were 
included. 
The  number  of  partial  responders  was  higher  in  the  600  μg  b.i.d.  group,  which  indicates  that  the 
difference in baseline UFC levels may have affected the outcome. 
The  proportion  of  patients  who  were  controlled  or  partially  controlled  was  34%  in  the  600  μg  b.i.d. 
group  and  41%  in  the  900  μg  b.i.d  group.  Thus,  a  difference  is  maintained  between  the  two  dose 
levels  when  also  the  partial  responders  are  included.  These  data  also  indicate  that  a  substantial 
number of patients may also benefit form the lower dose. 
The rate of patients that remained uncontrolled was only slightly higher in the 600 μg b.i.d. group.

randomized dose group (Full analysis set) 
Dose changes among controlled and partially controlled responders 
The dose could be increased (by 300 μg b.i.d.) at the Month 3 visit if the patient’s mUFC > 2 x ULN or 
if mUFC was higher than at baseline, and after 6 months if the patient’s mUFC > ULN. 
Dose titration data indicate that very few patients did benefit from a dose increase above 900 μg b.i.d.. 
Furthermore, in some of the responders a dose of 300 μg b.i.d. was sufficient to maintain control.  
Changes in clinical response subgroup status

Change from Month 1, 2 or 3 to Month 6 
Due  to  the  high  drop-out  rate  (which mainly  was  due  to  AEs  or  lack  of  effect)  and  dose  adjustments 
during the study period these data are somewhat difficult to interpret.  
Overall,  most  of  the  patients  (>  80%)  who  were  uncontrolled  at  either  Month  1,  2  or  3  were  also 
uncontrolled at Month 6. About 10% shifted from uncontrolled to controlled status at Month 6, and a 
slightly smaller proportion shifted from uncontrolled to partially controlled status. 
The data indicate that non-responders can be identified after 2-3 months of treatment. 
Table 8 Shifts in clinical response status from Month 1, 2 or 3 to Month 6 (Full Analysis Set – 
Study B2305) 
Change from Month 6 to Month 12 
The  results  are  generally  similar  as  for  the  shifts  from  Months  1,  2  and  3  described  above.  The 
proportions of controlled, partially controlled and uncontrolled patients were similar at Month 6 and at 
Month  12.  Most  (90.1%)  of  the  patients  who  were  uncontrolled  at  Month  6  remained  uncontrolled  at 
Month 12, whereas more than half of the patients who were controlled at Month 6 remained controlled 
at Month 12. 
Predictability of non-response 
The predictive capability of early non-response to identify eventual non-responders at Months 6 and 12 
was explored by analyzing shifts in responder status for patients who were uncontrolled at both Month 
1  and  2,  and  at  Months  1,  2  and  3  vs  response  status  at  Month  6  and  Month  12.  Of  the  72  patients 
who  were  uncontrolled  at  both  Month  1  and  2,  66  (91.7%)  were  uncontrolled  at  Month  6.  Of  the  63 
patients who were uncontrolled at Months 1, 2 and 3, 60 (95.2%) were uncontrolled at 6 months. The 
results were similar for analyses of shifts to Month 12. 
These  data  indicate  that  non-responders  can  be  identified  at  a  relatively  early  stage  of  the  therapy 
which  is  important  in  the  clinical  management  of  the  patient.  Information  that  discontinuation  of 
therapy should be considered in patients who have not responded after two months is included in the 
SmPC. 
Change from baseline in mUFC 
Page 42/90
 
 
 
 
The  mUFC  (±SD)  at  baseline  was  higher  in  the  600  μg  b.i.d.  group  than  in  the  900  μg  b.i.d.  group 
(1155.9 ± 2629.78 vs. 781.9± 926.38 nmol/24h). The mean absolute changes from baseline to Month 
6  in  mUFC  were  -463.4  and  -364.9  nmol/24h,  respectively,  for  the  600  and  900  μg  b.i.d.  groups. 
However,  due  to  the  higher  baseline  level  the  mean  percent  change  from  baseline  in  the  mUFC  was 
lower in the 600 μg b.i.d. group (-27.5% in the 600 μg b.i.d. group and -48.4% in the 900 μg b.i.d. 
group). The median percent change in mUFC was -47.9% in both dose groups. The difference between 
mean and median percent change from baseline in the 600 μg b.i.d. group was due to a few extreme 
values influencing the mean (percent changes of up to +542.2% were observed) at Month 6. 
Overall the median percent change from baseline was similar at all time points after Month 1 between 
the two groups, ranging between -47 and -68%.  
At  Month  12,  the  median  percent  change  in  mUFC  was  available  for  37  patients  in  the  600  μg  b.i.d. 
group  and  for  35  patients  in  the  900  μg  b.i.d.  group.  The  median  changes  from  baseline  were  -67.6 
and -62.4% in the respective groups. 
Figure 2 shows the mUFC values (±SE) over time. In both groups there was a robust decrease in the 
mUFC at Month 1, which appeared to be sustained to Month 12. It is important to note that during the 
course  of  the  study  the  number  of  patients  decreased  from  162  at  the  start  of  treatment  to  74  at 
Month 12. There is no apparent difference in the decrease in mUFC over time between the two doses 
among patients that completed the study. 
Thus  the  600  μg  b.i.d.  dose  apparently  has  an  effect  although;  maybe  due  to  the  higher  baseline 
values the primary endpoint was not met for this dose.

Page 43/90
 
 
 
 
Plasma ACTH 
Mean plasma ACTH levels were below baseline by Month 0.5 in the 900 μg b.i.d. group and by Month 1 
in  the  600  μg  b.i.d.  group  and  remained  below  baseline  levels  at  all  subsequent  time-points  for  both 
dose groups (Figure 3). The median plasma ACTH levels showed a more robust decrease over time in 
both treatment arms, which was evident after the first 15 days of treatment. 
Figure  3  Mean  (+/-SE)  plasma  ACTH  (pmol/L)  levels  at  time  points  up  to  Month  12  by 
randomized dose group (Full analysis set – Study B2305) 
However,  no  imputations  for  missing  values  were  made  for  the  secondary  endpoints  and  due  to  the 
large  drop-out  rate  these  data  represent  a  much  selected  patient  group.  In  order  to  get  a  better 
understanding of the pasireotide effect on ACTH, additional analyses both using imputations (LOCF) for 
missing values and also an analysis only including the patients that completed the study were provided 
by  the  Applicant.  These  analyses  support  the  original  analysis.  Baseline  values  for  completers  were 
somewhat lower than observed in the overall population, however, relevant reductions were observed 
over time for both dose groups with a more prominent effect in the 900 μg b.i.d. group. 
Clinical signs and symptoms of Cushing’s disease 
Continuous parameters 
At  Month  6,  improvements  in  both  treatment  groups  were  observed  for  several  studied  signs  and 
symptoms  of  Cushing’s  disease  (i.e.  sitting  systolic  blood  pressure,  sitting  diastolic  blood  pressure, 
BMI,  waist  circumference,  total  cholesterol,  Beck  depression  inventory  score,  Ferriman-Galway 
hirsutism  score  and  body  composition-region  fat  %).  There  was  a  tendency  for  these  to  be  more 
pronounced  in  the  controlled  subgroup.  The  changes  in  triglyceride  levels  were  small.  Summary 
statistics for clinical signs up to month 12 show that the improvements were maintained at Month 12. 
Categorical parameters 
In  both  dose  groups  there  were  patients  with  favorable  shifts  in  all  the  studied  signs  of  Cushing’s 
disease. Facial rubor improved at Month 6 in 36.7% and 59.6% of patients treated with 600 and 900 
Page 44/90
 
 
 
 
μg b.i.d., respectively. The greatest proportion of patients with improvement in facial rubor were those 
in the controlled response subgroups, 57.1% in the 600 μg b.i.d. group and 72.2% in the 900 μg b.i.d. 
group.  More  than  a  third  of  patients  in  either  treatment  group  also  demonstrated  improvement  in 
supraclavicular  fat  pad  and  dorsal  fat  pad,  and  the  rates  were  more  often  higher  in  patients  with 
complete or partial response than in patients who were uncontrolled. 
The  improvement  observed  in  the  clinical  signs  and  symptoms  of  Cushing’s  disease  supports  that 
pasireotide  has  clinically  relevant  effects  in  patients  with  Cushing’s  disease,  although  data  has  to  be 
interpreted with caution due to the small number of patients in each subgroup. 
Tumour 
volume 
Post-baseline  changes  in  tumour  volume  were  evaluated  by  MRI.  At  the  Month  12  assessment,  both 
dose groups demonstrated decreases in mean tumor volume (mean decreases were 9.1% and 43.8% 
for  the  600  and  900  μg  b.i.d.  groups,  respectively),  showing  a  trend  towards  tumour  reduction.  It  is 
important to note that in this study several patients did not have measurable tumour volume by MRI, 
and the analysis of mean percent change from baseline in tumour volume is based on a small sample 
size (14 and 18 patients for the respective dose groups). Thus the data on the effect of pasireotide on 
tumour  volume  has  to  be  interpreted  with  caution.  It  is,  however,  reassuring  that  a  trend  towards 
tumour reduction was observed. 
Quality of life 
A  novel  single-domain  12  item  Cushing’s  disease  health  related  quality  of  life  (HRQL)  questionnaire 
was  implemented  in  this  trial  and  the  significance  of  the  observed  changes  are  difficult  to  assess. 
Furthermore,  the  drop-out  rate  was  very  high.  Patients  that  continued  in  the  study  are  likely  to  be 
highly motivated and satisfied with the treatment. Thus the data has to be interpreted with caution and 
only lend limited support to this application. 
Baseline mean and median HRQL scores were similar for the two dose groups. Both dose groups had 
increases in the scores at Month 6, showing an improvement in the patient’s perception of their quality 
of life. The mean percent changes from baseline in HRQL scores were 31.3% and 73.0%, respectively, 
for  the  600  and  900  μg  b.i.d.  groups.  The  median  percent  changes  from  baseline  were  13.2%  and 
30.0%, respectively, for the 600 and 900 μg b.i.d. groups. Month 12 HRQL scores showed that patients 
continued to experience improvement in their quality of life.  
Analysis of primary efficacy endpoint by baseline UFC categories 
Overall,  the  highest  response  rates  were  seen  in  patients  with  baseline  mUFC  ≤  5  x  ULN  (25  of  92 
patients, 27.2%). The response rate for patients with baseline mUFC > 5 x ULN was 5 of 61 patients, 
8.2%. 
Although  response  is  to  some  extent  associated  with  the  baseline  value,  the  basline  UFC  does 
apparently  not  entirely  predict  response  since  individual  patients  with  high  levels  did  respond  and 
indeed on the lower dose. 
Correlation between mUFC and improvement in clinical signs and symptoms 
The relationship between mUFC and clinical signs and symptoms of Cushing’s disease was explored as 
post-hoc  analyses  by  plotting  mean  mUFC  values  and  the  following  parameters  over  time:  systolic 
blood  pressure,  diastolic  blood  pressure,  HDL,  LDL,  total  cholesterol,  triglycerides,  BMI,  weight,  and 
HRQL scores (exemplified in Figure 4 below; diastolic blood pressure).  
A  marked  decrease  in  mean  mUFC  values  was  observed  within  the  first  month  of  treatment,  after 
which  mean  mUFC  levels  remained  stable  up  to  12  months  for  those  patients  who  continued  in  the 
study. By visual inspection of the graphs, improvements in blood pressure (both systolic and diastolic) 
Page 45/90
 
 
 
and HRQL were observed within the first 3 months of treatment, concurrent with the decrease in mean 
mUFC.  These  improvements  were  sustained  up  to  12  months.  A  trend  for  improvement  in  lipids  was 
also noted, as was a trend of decreasing weight and BMI over 12 months.  
Although  limited  due  to  the  high  drop-out  rates,  these  data  support  that  pasireotide  has  a  clinically 
relevant effect in patients with Cushing’s disease.

Ancillary analyses 
Methods of subgroup analyses 
The primary efficacy endpoint at Month 6 was analyzed by demographic and disease factors for study 
B2305 using percentages and 95% CI.  
Demographic factors 
Primary efficacy 
The  proportion  of  responders  at  Month  6  in  the  primary  efficacy  analysis  (those  with  a  decrease  in 
mUFC  to  <  ULN  and  with  no  dose  increase)  was  analysed  by  demographic  baseline  factors.  The 
numbers  of  patients  in  the  age  >  65  years,  male,  and  race  subgroups  other  than  Caucasian  were 
relatively small, (especially for the age > 65 years and race subgroups other than Caucasian) and do 
not allow meaningful conclusions to be drawn. 
It is, however, noteworthy that the response rate was very low among males with 15 % responders in 
the  lower  dose  group  and  no  male  responders  in  the  higher  dose  group.  Further  analysis  of  these 
patients could not reveal any explanation for this finding.  
Disease factors 
The  proportion  of  responders  at  Month  6  in  the  primary  efficacy  analysis  is  presented  by  disease 
history  in  Table  9.  Benefit  was  evident  irrespective  of  patients’  Cushing’s  disease  status  or  previous 
medication.  The  proportions  of  patients  with  de  novo  disease  or  previous  pituitary  irradiation  were 
small, and therefore any comparisons must be interpreted with caution. 
Page 46/90
 
 
 
 
The  responder  rate  among  patients  on  previous  medication  was  slightly  higher  than  in  the  overall 
analysis for both doses; however, the wash-out periods applied in the study were reassuring.

Study B2208  
Study  B2208  was  a  multicenter,  open-label,  single-arm,  proof-of-concept  study  to  assess  the  safety 
and  efficacy  of  pasireotide  600  μg  b.i.d.  s.c.  for  15  days  in  patients  with  Cushing’s  disease.  Patients 
were accrued into two cohorts following Simon’s two-stage design. A cohort of 10 patients was enrolled 
at the first stage. If there were at least 2 responders among these patients, then a further cohort of 16 
patients was to be enrolled into the second stage. A patient was considered a responder if the mean of 
UFC levels collected from the 24-hour urine samples from Days 14 and 15 (i.e. completed on Days 15 
and 16, respectively) were within normal limits. The dose could be reduced by 150 μg per injection in 
case of drug-related toxicity. 
Since  this  was  a  short-term  study,  both  de  novo  Cushing’s  disease  patients  who  were  candidates  for 
pituitary surgery and patients with recurrent Cushing’s disease post-pituitary resection who had never 
received pituitary irradiation were eligible for enrolment. 
Diagnosis  of  ACTH-dependent  Cushing’s  disease  must  have  been  verified  within  two  months  of  study 
entry by: a) two consecutive urinary free cortisol (UFC) measurements ≥ 2 x ULN (276 nmol/24h); b) 
morning  plasma  ACTH  within  or  above  normal  range;  and  c)  either  MRI  confirmation  of  a  pituitary 
macroadenoma (≥ 1 cm) or an inferior petrosal sinus gradient greater than three after CRH treatment 
for microadenoma (< 1 cm). 
Key  inclusion  criteria  included:  ≥  18  years  of  age,  diagnosis  of  Cushing’s  disease,  and  a  Karnofsky 
Performance  Status  ≥  60.  Key  exclusion  criteria  included  hypercortisolism  due  to  ectopic  ACTH 
secretion, adrenal tumours, nodular bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, or genetic causes; active gallbladder 
disease,  poorly-controlled  diabetes  mellitus,  cardiac  disease,  and  patients  who  had  received  long-
acting somatostatin anagoges within 8 weeks prior to study initiation. Inclusion and exclusion criteria 
were comparable to those of the pivotal study. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to assess the efficacy of pasireotide in patients with Cushing’s 
disease  as  measured  by  normalization  of  24-hour  urinary  free  cortisol  (UFC)  after  15  days  of 
treatment. The secondary objectives for efficacy were to assess the effect of pasireotide on the clinical 
manifestations  of  excess  cortisol  (such  as  blood  pressure  and  blood  sugar),  to  assess  the  effect  of 
Page 51/90
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
pasireotide  on  plasma  ACTH  and  serum  cortisol,  and  to  monitor  the  trough  plasma  concentrations  of 
pasireotide at steady state. 
Results 
Thirty-nine  patients  were  enrolled  in  this  study  to  ensure  at  least  26  evaluable  patients.  Of  the  39 
patients who enrolled, 38 completed the study. Ten patients were excluded from the primary efficacy 
population due to either having baseline UFC within normal range, or missing UFC at baseline or end-
of-study. Thus, 29 patients were included in the primary efficacy population. 
The  study  was  considered  to  have  met  its  primary  efficacy  endpoint  if  at  least  5  of  the  first  26 
evaluable  patients  responded.  All  5  patients  who  were  responders  were  in  this  group.  Based  on  this 
analysis the response rate was 5/26 (19.2%), and the study met the criteria for success. 
Overall,  there  was  a  tendency  for  mean  serum  cortisol  and  plasma  ACTH  levels  to  decrease. 
Responders achieved a greater mean reduction in both plasma ACTH and serum cortisol than reducers 
or non-responders. 
Based  on  sub-group  analysis,  it  appeared  that  at  the  same  dose  level  UFC  responders  had  higher 
pasireotide  PK  exposure  than  UFC  reducers  and  non-reducers.  These  data  seemed  to  suggest  a 
relationship between PK exposure of pasireotide and PD response of UFC. 
Therefore, 600 μg b.i.d. and higher doses were recommended for Phase III trial B2305. 
Extension study B2208E1 
Study  B2208E1  was  a  Phase  II  extension  to  the  multicenter,  open-label  study  B2208  to  assess  the 
safety and efficacy of pasireotide 600 μg b.i.d. s.c. in patients with Cushing’s disease who had already 
received  15  days  of  pasireotide  treatment  in  the  core  study  and  who  had  either  responded  or 
experienced  significant  clinical  benefit,  defined  as  improvement  in  UFC  levels  or  significant 
improvement  of  symptoms  of  hypercortisolism  such  as  hypertension.  Patients  who  achieved  a 
normalization of UFC levels in the core study could continue on the 600 μg b.i.d. dose. Those who did 
not achieve normalization, or for those whose UFC levels rose during the extension, the dose could be 
increased to 900 μg b.i.d. If this was not tolerated a 600 μg t.i.d. schedule could be adopted. As in the 
core, the dose could be reduced by 150 μg per injection in case of drug-related intolerability. 
The  primary  efficacy  variable  was  the  proportion  of  responders  to  treatment  based  on  the 
normalization of UFC levels after 6 months of treatment in the extension phase. 
Other efficacy assessments included serum cortisol, and plasma ACTH. 
Results 
Of the 38 patients who completed the core B2208, 19 patients entered the extension study B2208E1. 
The  majority  of  patients  were  female  with  a  mean  age  of  43  years.  Patients  remained  on  treatment 
from 2 months to 4.8 years with a mean duration of 16 months. Three patients were still on treatment 
at the time of data cut-off. 
Efficacy was evaluated for 18 patients (one patient whose baseline mUFC was within normal range was 
excluded  from  the  efficacy  population).  At  Month  6,  4  patients  (22%,  95%  CI:  6.4  to  47.6)  were 
responders  and  6  patients  (33.3%)  were  reducers.  Eight  patients  (44.4%)  were  non-reducers,  either 
because  the  Month  6  mUFC  values  were  greater  than  the  baseline  (2  patients),  or  the  patient 
discontinued prior to the Month 6 visit (6 patients). 
Response status at B2208E1 entry vs response status at 6 months: 
Page 52/90
 
 
 
  Of the 3 responders in the core study that entered the extension, 1 was still a responder at 6 
months and 1 patient became a reducer. The 3rd patient discontinued the study prior to Month 
6 and was therefore counted as a non-reducer at 6 months. 
  Of  the  11  reducers  in  the  core  study  that  entered  the  extension,  5  maintained  their  reducer 
status at 6 months. Two of the reducers became responders at 6 months, and 4 became non-
reducers. 
  Of the 4 non-reducers in the core study that entered the extension, 1 became a responder at 6 
months and 3 remained non-reducers. 
Other efficacy results 
For  all  pasireotide  doses  combined,  despite  some  variability  in  the  mUFC  values,  a  consistent  mean 
reduction in mUFC relative to baseline values was maintained throughout the extension study period. 
Mean  reductions  in  mUFC  from  baseline  were  seen  at  most  visits  for  the  responders  and  reducer 
groups.  For  the  non-reducer  group,  mean  reductions  were  observed  at  Day  14/Day  15  of  the  core 
study and at extension Month 3. Furthermore, there was a consistent trend towards reduction in serum 
cortisol relative to baseline which was maintained throughout the extension study period. 
A sustained reduction in mean plasma ACTH was observed across all patients throughout the extension 
study  as  well  as  for  each  UFC  response  subgroup  including  non-responders  at  the  majority  of  visits. 
Generally, the responders showed a greater reduction from baseline in ACTH at every visit compared 
to  the  reducers.  For  the  UFC  non-reducers,  only  one  patient  had  a  plasma  ACTH  at  Month  6  which 
showed a reduction at Month 6 relative to core baseline. 
There  was  a  decrease  in  mean  systolic  and  diastolic  blood  pressure  and  weight  over  time  relative  to 
core baseline levels. 
The extension study provides only very limited data on long-term treatment with pasireotide since very 
few  patients  have  continued  beyond  6  months.  The  data  in  the  extension  study  are  generally  in  line 
with  the  data  from  the  pivotal  study  and  indicate  a  maintained  effect  of  pasireotide  over  time.  
The  clinical  data  for  the  3  patients  of study  B2208  still  on  treatment  at  the cut-off  of  the  study  have 
been provided. All these three patients experienced major decrease and even mUFC/24h normalisation 
over  the  4  years  treatment  duration.  Even  if  limited  in  terms  of  number  of  patients,  these  data 
demonstrate  that  pasireotide  can  be  used  for  long  term  treatment  with  maintained  efficacy  in  some 
patients. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The  application  is  based  on  one  pivotal  study  (B2305).  No  formal  dose-response  studies  were 
performed,  instead  the  dose  was  chosen  based  on  PK  data  from  the  phase  I  studies  in  healthy 
volunteers and theoretical assumptions regarding necessary plasma concentrations needed to suppress 
ACTH levels. These data only lend weak support to the chosen doses. However, due to the rarity of the 
disease in combination with difficulties in evaluating the primary pharmacology in healthy volunteers, 
this strategy is acceptable and in line with the recommendations in the CHMP scientific advice. 
Standard statistical methods cannot be easily applied and no EU recommendations are available for the 
development of medicinal products for Cushing’s disease. The design of the pivotal study is generally in 
line with the recommendations given at the CHMP scientific advice. A major difference compared to the 
study design previously discussed with the CHMP scientific advice working party was the fact that the 
two doses to be investigated were not compared with each other but each dose was tested against the 
Page 53/90
 
 
 
hypothesis that at least 15 % responders (the lower bound of the 95 % CI) should be achieved. The 
absence of statistical comparison between both treatments arms has been sufficiently justified by the 
Applicant. A responder rate of at least 15 % is considered acceptable.  
Furthermore, this cut-off was not modified after the change of the primary endpoint (amendment 6). 
The modification of the primary endpoint has no major impact on the lower bound of minimal efficacy. 
Indeed,  the  conclusions  are  the  same  and  the  lower  limit  of  the  95%  CI  of  the  response  rate  for  the 
higher dose group is greater than 15%.  
In  the  primary  analysis  imputations  for  missing  values  was  made  by  LOCF,  whereas  no  imputations 
were  made  for  the  secondary  endpoints.  When  evaluating  the  primary  endpoint  no  adjustment  for 
multiplicity issues was made.  
Some  changes  to  the  originally  proposed  study  protocol  were  made.  The  number  of  patients  to  be 
included  was  increased  and  the  study  duration  was  extended  to  12  months,  which  is  welcomed.  As 
dose-titration was allowed during the study after three months of treatment, some information on the 
usefulness of up- or down-titration of pasireotide is provided.  
Inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  were  adequate.  Some  deviations  compared  to  the  recommendations 
given in the CHMP scientific advice were noted. Firstly, the mUFC level was lowered to 1.5 times ULN 
as  compared  to  2  times  ULN  due  to  difficulties  in  recruiting  patients.  Secondly,  patients  who  had 
undergone  pituitary  irradiation  at  least  ten  years  before  inclusion  could  be  included.  Both  these 
deviations were deemed acceptable by the CHMP. 
Since  surgery  is  the  primary  treatment  choice  for  Cushing’s  disease  patients  and  given  that  surgery 
has  a  relatively  high  success  rate,  patients  who  were  candidates  for  surgery  were  not  considered 
eligible  for  this  study,  which  is  acceptable.  Patients  who  were  on  medical  treatment  for  Cushing’s 
disease were eligible after a wash-out period. The wash-out periods applied for the listed medications 
have been adequately justified. 
The decision not to include an active comparator or a placebo-arm has been adequately justified by the 
Applicant.  The  primary  objective  was  somewhat  changed  in  relation  to  the  CHMP  scientific  advice  in 
that  only  patients  achieving  a  normalisation  of  UFC  were  considered  responders,  furthermore  the 
endpoint  was  measured  at  six  months  instead  of,  as  initially  proposed,  three  months.  Since  these 
changes  are  conservative  they  are  acceptable.  A  conservative  approach  was  further  taken  in  that 
patients who discontinued were regarded as non-responders.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The drop-out rate in the pivotal study was very high with 34 % of patients having discontinued already 
prior to or at six months. Since patients who discontinued were considered to be treatments failures, 
the  discontinuations  are  not  considered  to  hamper  the  evaluation  of  the  primary  endpoint;  however, 
the  outcome  of  secondary  endpoints  will  be  less  robust.  Discontinuations  were  evenly  distributed 
between the two study groups, both with reference to AEs and lack of effect; however, more patients 
from the 900 μg b.i.d. group entered the extension phase. Overall, 17 % of patients discontinued due 
to  adverse  events  and  25  %  due  to  unsatisfactory  therapeutic  effect.  In  total,  52%  of  patients  had 
withdrawn  from  the  study  at  month  12.  However,  in  the  group  of  patients  who  were  partial  or 
complete responders, the drop-out rate was considerably lower (31.6 % at month 12) compared to the 
uncontrolled group (69.3 % at month 12). 
The  proportion  and  reasons  for  discontinuations  during  this  study  and  particularly  during  the  first 
months  (unsatisfactory  therapeutic  effect  and  adverse  events)  should  be  taken  into  account  for  the 
Page 54/90
 
 
 
efficacy  and  safety  profile  of  pasireotide.  Moreover,  the  main  reasons  for  unsatisfactory  therapeutic 
effect are linked to biological lack of efficacy. 
Considering  the  small  size  of  the  study,  the  two  study  groups  were  well  balanced  with  regards  to 
baseline demographic characteristics. The majority of patients were female, which is to be expected in 
this  patient  group.  Very  few  patients  above  the  age  of  65  were  included.  The  numbers  of  protocol 
deviations were few and  evenly distributed  between the two study groups, thus a large proportion of 
the patients were included in the PP-set. 
No formal comparison was to be made between the two doses; the data provided therefore does not 
allow  for  any  conclusions  regarding  dose-response  or  whether  any  of  the  investigated  doses  are 
superior to the other. Only the 900 μg b.i.d. dose met the primary efficacy endpoint, i.e. normalisation 
of the mUFC in 26.3 % (95 % CI:16.6, 35.9). It should be noted that from a theoretical viewpoint it is 
not  possible  to  claim  that  the  higher  dose  met  the  pre-specified  threshold  of  15%  since  the  two 
confidence intervals for the two doses in study B2305 are presented without adjusting (as suggested in 
the study protocol) for multiplicity issues. The observed response rate is, however, considered clinically 
relevant  in  this  patient  group  where  long-term  treatment  options  are  scarce.  However,  for  both 
dosages, the observed responder rates were below the expected rate (30%), as initially defined by the 
Applicant. 
The baseline mUFC was considerably higher in the 600 μg b.i.d. group when compared to the 900 μg 
b.i.d.  group  and  a  higher  proportion  of  patients  in  the  900  μg  b.i.d.  group  had  been  previously 
medically  treated.  These  observed  differences  may  have  affected  the  outcome.  The  wash-out  periods 
applied in the study were, however, chosen with a sufficient margin to preclude a lingering effect of the 
previous medication.  
When analysing the primary endpoint, imputations for missing values were made. In order to evaluate 
the  robustness  of  the  data,  the  Applicant  has  provided  information  on  the  number  of  values  imputed 
and  has  also  provided  additional  analyses  without  imputation.  The  results  of  the  more  conservative 
analysis  excluding  the  imputated  data  do  not  change  the  overall  conclusion  on  a  relevant  effect  of 
pasireotide. 
The  supportive  primary  outcome  analysis  of  partial  responders  showed  that  the  number  of  partial 
responders  was  higher  in  the  600  μg  b.i.d.  group,  which  may  again  indicate  that  the  difference  in 
baseline UFC levels may have affected the outcome but also that the 600 μg b.i.d. dose has an effect 
on lowering UFC. The rate of patients that remained uncontrolled was only slightly higher in the 600 μg 
b.i.d. group. The exploratory analysis of response by baseline mUFC further showed that the response 
is to some extent associated with the baseline value. The baseline UFC appears, however, not entirely 
predictive of response since individual patients with high mUFC values did respond and indeed on the 
lower dose. 
Dose  titration  data  indicate  that  very  few  patients  had  benefit  from  a  dose  increase  above  900  μg 
b.i.d., whereas an increase from 600 μg b.i.d. to 900 μg b.i.d. did result in an improvement as shown 
by  the  Applicant.  Furthermore,  in  some  of  the  responders  a  dose  of  300 μg  b.i.d. was sufficient.  The 
efficacy data therefore lend support to the recommendation to start with an initial dose of 600 μg b.i.d. 
with an option for uptitration to 900 μg b.i.d. 
The data on patient shifts between different responder groups is somewhat difficult to interpret due to 
the  high  drop-out  rate  (which  mainly  was  due  to  AEs  or  lack  of  effect)  and  dose  adjustments  during 
the study period. The absence of response to pasireotide was observed rapidly in the majority of non-
responders.  In  fact,  of  the  72  patients  who  were  uncontrolled  at  both  Month  1  and  2,  91.7%  were 
uncontrolled  at  Month  6  and  of  the  63  patients  who  were  uncontrolled  at  Months  1,  2  and  3,  95.2% 
were still uncontrolled at 6 months. This indicates that non-responders can be identified at a relatively 
Page 55/90
 
 
 
early stage in therapy, which is important in the clinical management of the patient. Information that 
discontinuation of therapy should be considered in patients who have not responded after two months 
is included in the SmPC.  
The ACTH data show a continuous decrease of ACTH levels in both dose groups over time in support of 
the proposed pharmacodynamic effect of pasireotide. However, no imputations for missing values were 
made  for  the  secondary  endpoint  and  due  to  the  large  drop-out  rate  these  data  represent  a  much 
selected  patient  group.  In  order  to  get  a  better  understanding  of  the  pasireotide  effect  on  ACTH, 
additional  analyses  both  using  imputations  (LOCF)  for  missing  values  and  also  an  analysis  only 
including  the  patients  that  completed  the  study  were  provided  by  the  Applicant.  These  analyses 
support  the  original  analysis.  Baseline  values  for  completers  were  somewhat  lower  than  observed  in 
the  overall  population,  however,  relevant  reductions  were  observed  over  time  for  both  dose  groups 
with a more prominent effect in the 900 μg b.i.d. group. 
The  improvement  observed  in  the  clinical  signs  and  symptoms  of  Cushing’s  disease  supports  that 
pasireotide  has  clinically  relevant  effects  in  patients  with  Cushing’s  disease,  although  data  has  to  be 
interpreted with caution especially as the drop-out rate was high.  
Since  the  drop-out  rate  was  high  and  patients  that  continued  in  the  study  are  likely  to  be  highly 
motivated and satisfied with the treatment, the quality of life data are of limited value. Furthermore a 
new HRQL questionnaire was used in this trial and the clinical significance of the differences observed 
is difficult to assess. Thus the data has to be interpreted with caution and only lend minor support to 
this application. 
Due  to  the  small  sample  of  patients  that  had  measurable  tumour  volume  the  data  on  the  effect  of 
pasireotide  on  tumour  volume  has  to  be  interpreted  with  caution.  It  is,  however,  reassuring  that  a 
trend towards tumour reduction was observed. 
Subgroup  analyses  based  on  demographic  and  disease  history  were  performed.  Due  to  the  small 
numbers,  these  analyses  have  to  be  interpreted  with  caution.  It  is,  however,  noteworthy  that  the 
response  rate  was  very  low  among  males  with  no  male  responder  in  the  higher  dose  group.  Further 
analysis of data, including PK data could not identify any explanation for this finding which may be due 
to chance. 
The small supportive and short-term study B2208 showed results that were comparable to the results 
in  the  pivotal  study  and  is  therefore  supportive.  Limited  efficacy  data  have  been  provided  from  the 
extension study (B2208E1) up to six months of treatment.  
Very  few  patients  (63  in  study  B2305  and  7  in  study  B2208E1)  have  been  treated  for  at  least  12 
months and only four patients in study B2208E1 have been treated for up to 24 months. Efficacy data 
up to 12 months indicate that the effect of pasireotide is maintained in responders to treatment.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In  the  overall  population  pasireotide  globally  reduced  the  24-hour  urinary  free  cortisol  (UFC)  and 
normalised  UFC  levels  in  some  patients,  i.e.  5/29  in  Study  B2208  after  15  days  of  treatment  and 
33/162 patients in Study B2305 after 6 months regardless the dosage received. In the pivotal study, 
only the high dosage (900 µg) met the primary endpoint, but the rate of responders was low (26.3%) 
and  was  even  lower  for  the  600  µg  b.i.d.  dosage  (response  rate  of  14.6%).  Consequently,  a  large 
proportion of patients withdrew from the study due to lack of effect. In total, 52% of the patients had 
withdrawn  from  the  study  at  month  12.  However,  in  the  group  of  patients  who  were  partial  or 
complete responders, the drop-out rate was considerably lower (31.6 % at month 12) compared to the 
uncontrolled  group  (69.3  %  at  month  12).  Both  partial  and  complete  responders  achieved  clinically 
Page 56/90
 
 
 
relevant effects regarding signs and symptoms of Cushing’s disease and thus also patients with partial 
response should be taken into consideration when evaluating the effect of pasireotide. 
The  most  effective  dose  has  not  been  clearly  defined.  An  increase  in  dosage  at  month  3  in  non-
responders to the 900 μg b.i.d. dose did not seem to improve the response to treatment whereas some 
improvement was observed in patients uptitrated from 600 μg b.i.d. to 900 μg b.i.d.. In addition, the 
study  groups  were  imbalanced  with  regards  to  the  baseline  mUFC  (higher  values  in  the  group 
randomised to the 600 μg b.i.d. dose), which may have affected the outcome of the primary endpoint 
in  favour  of  the  higher  dose.  The  results  concerning  mean  reduction  of  mUFC  may  indicate  that  the 
lower  dose  may  be  as  effective  as  the  higher  dose  in  some  patients.  These  data  support  the  SmPC 
recommendation  to  initiate  treatment  at  the  lower  dose  with  an  option  for  uptitration  to  the  higher 
dose. 
Responders  to  treatment  were  mainly  observed  in  the  two  first  months  of  treatment.  The  study  data 
indicate that individual response may vary and although responder rates were highest in patients with 
mUFC  <  5  x  ULN,  baseline  UFC  data  are  not  entirely  predictive  of  response.  Available  data  does  not 
allow  characterisation  of  responders  to  treatment,  however,  since  non-responders  can  be  detected 
early  and  recommendations  on  treatment  discontinuation  are  given  in  the  SmPC,  this  issue  does  not 
preclude safe use of the product. 
Since  very  limited  data  are  available  beyond  one  year,  further  post-approval  follow-up  should  be 
undertaken. 
The efficacy of pasireotide in the treatment of patients with Cushing’s disease has been shown. Taking 
the low response rate into account, the wording of the indication has, however, been strengthened to 
clarify  that  pasireotide  is  a  second  line  therapy  to  surgery.  Thus,  the  following  wording  for  SmPC 
section 4.1 was agreed: 
“Signifor is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with Cushing’s disease for whom surgery has 
failed or for whom surgery is no option.” 
The  Applicant  is  recommended  to  perform  additional  biomarker  investigations  relevant  to  the 
mechanism of action of pasireotide (study G2304). 
The Applicant is recommended to perform study B2219 to further examine the optimal management of 
hyperglycaemia.  In  this  regard,  the  Applicant  is  recommended  to  provide  a  complete protocol  to  the 
CHMP before the start of the study and to provide the results when available. 
Finally,  the  Applicant  is  recommended  to  perform  a  post-marketing  surveillance  study,  to  further 
document  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  pasireotide  s.c. 
in  patients  with  Cushing’s  disease 
(CSOM230B2410).  The  final  protocol  has  been  included  in  the  RMP  and  the  RMP  pharmacovigilance 
plan has been updated accordingly. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The  overall  safety  evaluation  is  based  on  201 Cushing’s  disease  patients  who  participated  in  study 
B2208, its extension B2208E1, and in study B2305 and whom were exposed to pasireotide treatment 
at  various  doses.  No  pooling  of  data  from  these  studies  was  performed  due  to  differences  in  study 
design and patient populations. 
In  addition  to  these  datasets,  safety  data  from the  acromegaly  studies  B2103,  B2201,  and  B2201E1, 
as well as the carcinoid syndrome study B2202, were also evaluated. Seven phase I healthy volunteers 
studies also support the safety evaluation: 4 single dose, 2 multiple dose studies and one continuous 
s.c. infusion study (refer to exposure).  
Page 57/90
 
 
 
Two  special safety  clinical  studies  were  conducted:  one  evaluated  the  QT/QT  interval  corrected  (QTc) 
profile of pasireotide in healthy volunteers (B2113) and the other the safety of pasireotide in subjects 
with varying degrees of hepatic function (B2114). 
Patient exposure 
Exposure  to  pasireotide  was  sufficient  to  allow  for  an  adequate  safety  assessment  in  patients 
representative of the intended target population (Table 11). There were 201 patients in the Cushing’s 
disease  safety  population.  The  mean  durations  of  exposure  to  study  drug  in  study  B2305  were 
comparable  between  the  2  pasireotide  treatment  groups  (10.77  months)  as  were  the  proportions  of 
patients that had at least 6 months’ exposure (68% of all patients). The mean duration of exposure to 
pasireotide  in  study  B2208  was  14.8  days.  In  study  B2208E1,  the  total  treatment  duration  was 
between  2  and  58 months,  with  a  mean  duration  of  16  months;  an  exposure  duration  of  at  least  6 
months was observed in 63% of patients. 
In total 122 patients with Cushing’s disease have been exposed for at least 6 months, 70 patients have 
been exposed for at least 12 months and 17 patients have been exposed for at least 24 months. Only 
6 patients were treated with 600 µg b.i.d. and 7 patients with 900 µg b.i.d. pasireotide for at least 24 
months in the pivotal study B2305. One patient with Cushing’s disease was treated for 4.8 years in the 
extension study B2208E1. The long-term experience is thus limited. 
Of  all  patient  exposure  data  obtained  from  the  acromegaly  (72  patients),  carcinoid  syndrome  (45 
patients),  and  healthy  volunteer  populations  (294  subjects),  study  exposure  ranged  from  single  s.c. 
doses to up to 61 months; the longest median duration of exposure in these studies was 22.7 months 
(range 4 to 61 months) in the acromegaly dataset. In the acromegaly study, 8 patients had more than 
3  years  of  treatment.  In the  carcinoid  syndrome  study,  the  maximal  exposure  was  more  than  1  year 
(85 weeks) for 4 patients.

Adverse events  
Study B2305 
Almost all patients (98.1%) had at least one AE, and the majority of patients (95.7%) had at least one 
AE considered to be related to study drug. A total of 28 patients (17.3%) discontinued due to an AE.  
SAEs  were  reported  for  40  patients  (24.7%);  of  these  there  were  19  patients  that  had  study  drug-
related SAEs.  
The  frequencies  of  AEs  and  SAEs  were  generally  similar  between  both  dose  groups;  however,  SAEs 
related to study drug were slightly more frequent  in the 900 μg b.i.d. group. This was mainly due to 
SAEs  related  to  metabolism  and  nutrition  disorders  (predominantly  diabetes/hyperglycemia),  which 
occurred  more  frequently  in  the  900  μg  b.i.d.  group.  The  following  table  summarises  AEs  and  SAEs 
observed in the pivotal study.

The  SOCs  with  the  highest  frequencies  were  gastrointestinal  disorders  (80.9%),  metabolism  and 
nutrition  disorders  (74.7%),  and  general  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions  (54.3%).  In 
general, the frequencies of AEs by SOC were comparable between the two groups. 
By  preferred  term,  the  most  frequent  AEs  overall  (>  15%  of  patients)  were  diarrhea,  nausea, 
hyperglycemia,  cholelithiasis,  headache,  abdominal  pain,  fatigue  and  diabetes  mellitus.  There  were 
minor  differences  in  frequencies  of  some  preferred  terms  between  the  two  groups.  AEs  that  were 
slightly  more  frequent  in  the  900  μg  b.i.d.  group  included  nausea,  hyperglycemia,  fatigue,  diabetes 
mellitus,  anxiety  and  insomnia.  AEs  that  were  more  frequent  in  the  600  μg  b.i.d.  group  included 
asthenia, hypoglycemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, ALT increased, abdominal pain upper, and myalgia. 
One  patient  (B2305-0701/0002)  became  pregnant  during  the  study  and  as  a  result  was  discontinued 
from the study. The patient had an abortion. 
The most frequent Grade 3/4 AEs were hyperglycemia-related. 
Note  that  multiple  preferred  terms  related  to  the  same  abnormality  may  have  been  reported.  For 
example,  a  patient  may  have  had  AEs  reported  for  glucose  metabolism  abnormalities  with  preferred 
terms  of  hyperglycemia,  diabetes  mellitus  or  type  2  diabetes  mellitus.  That  patient  could  therefore 
have been counted for each of these preferred terms. 
AE suspected to be study drug related 
A summary of most frequent AEs, which were assessed as related to study drug by the investigator is 
provided in Table 13. The frequencies of most study drug-related AEs were comparable in the 2 dose

groups.  The  five  most  frequently  reported  drug-related  AEs  were  diarrhea,  nausea,  hyperglycemia, 
cholelithiasis and abdominal pain.

Other notable AEs, which were assessed as drug-related and reported with a frequency of less than 5% 
and  therefore  not  included  in  the  table  were  (by  preferred  terms)  QT-prolongation  (overall  3.7%); 
sinus  bradycardia  (overall  4.3);  anemia  (overall  0.6%);  prothrombin  time  prolonged  (overall  1.2%) 
and  blood  amylase  increased  (overall  2.5%).  These  AEs  were  selected  either  because  they  could  be 
considered as a class effect for somatostatin analogues (QT-prolongation and sinus bradycardia) or due 
to  their  connection  to  identified  and  potential  risks  as  identified  in  the  RMP  (anemia  [identified  risk: 
hematological  abnormalities];  prothrombin  time  prolonged  potential  [risk:  coagulation  abnormalities] 
and blood amylase increased [potential risk: pancreatitis].  
AEs in other populations including healthy volunteers 
The  most  frequently  reported  AEs  in  acromegaly  patients  were  gastrointestinal  disorders  (50%)  such 
as  nausea,  diarrhoea  as  well  as  nervous  system  disorders  (30%)  and  infections  and  infestations 
(26.7%).  Globally,  blood  glucose  abnormality  was  reported  in  fewer  patients  with  acromegaly  (11 
patients:  18.3%)  than  in  patients  with  Cushing’s  disease  (40%  of  hyperglycaemia).  Hyperglycaemic-
related  preferred  terms  (blood  glucose  increased,  glycosylated  haemoglobin  increased,  diabetes 
mellitus) were reported in 8.3%, 6.3% and 5% of patients, in 3 treatment groups respectively. In the 
extension  phase  of  the  study,  this  number  increased  and  even  14  (46.7%)  patients  reported  such 
hyperglycaemic-related  AEs.  However,  the  total  number  of  patients  that  were  included  and  assessed 
during this extension phase was rather limited. 
The  most  frequently  reported  AEs  in  patients  with  carcinoid  syndrome  were  also  gastrointestinal 
disorders  (75.6%)  such  as  abdominal  pain,  nausea  and  diarrhoea.  Weight  decreased  was  the  most 
common  adverse  event  in  this  dataset  (19  patients:  42.2%).  Hyperglycaemia  and  diabetes  mellitus 
were reported in 15.6% and 8.9% of patients, respectively. More than 60% of General disorders and 
Page 60/90
 
 
 
 
 
 
administration  site  conditions  were  reported  reflecting  probably  the  poor  local  tolerance.  Cardiac 
disorders were reported in 3 patients (6.7%). 
In  the  phase  I  studies,  gastrointestinal  AEs  were  reported  at  all  doses,  for  both  single  doses  and 
multiple doses of pasireotide. Diarrhoea and nausea were the most frequently reported AEs with even 
reports of severe diarrhoea and abdominal distension. Injection site reactions are also considerable as 
well as AE of headache. 
With  regard  to  hyperglycaemia,  both fasting  and  post-prandial  glucose  levels  were  increased  after  all 
pasireotide  doses.  Levels  returned  to  baseline/control  values  by  approximately  10  hours  after 
pasireotide dose.  
AEs of special interest – study B2305 
AEs of special interest are potential safety concerns identified in the pre-clinical programme, and AEs 
expected  with  the  somatostatin  analogue  class  and/or  in  the  treatment  of  Cushing’s  disease.  Twenty 
groups  of  AEs  of  special  interest  were  defined  (Table  14).  The  analysis  of  AEs  of  special  interest 
provides  an  incidence  rate  for  a  particular  AE  in  a  manner  that  is  more  inclusive.  For  example,  all 
preferred terms related to glucose metabolism abnormalities were captured by this analysis to provide 
a  single  incidence  rate,  as  opposed  to  the  individual  incidence  rates  for  each  preferred  term  (e.g. 
hyperglycemia, diabetes mellitus, type 2 diabetes mellitus). This analysis was only performed for study 
B2305.

The majority of patients (96.3%) in study B2305 reported at least 1 AE of special interest regardless of 
study  drug  relationship.  Hyperglycaemia-related,  diarrhoea-related,  nausea-related,  and  gallbladder 
and biliary-related AEs were the most commonly reported AEs of special interest.  
Of note, the incidences of AEs related to injection site reactions were comparable between the 2 dose 
groups in study B2305 and were reported by 14.8% of all patients. AEs that were related to injection 
site reactions and that were considered related to study drug were reported by 13.6% of all patients.

were no findings correlating to the non-clinical findings of fibromas. 
Hyperglycaemia-related AEs 
Hyperglycaemia-related  AEs  (e.g.  hyperglycaemia,  diabetes  mellitus,  blood  glucose  increased)  were 
observed in 72.8% of patients in study B2305 (Table 14, Table 15) and were mostly considered study 
drug-related.

The  proportions  of  patients  who  experienced  these  AEs  were  comparable  between  the  600  µg  b.i.d. 
and 900 µg b.i.d. groups. Most of these patients (approximately two-thirds) had a maximum Grade 1 
or  2  AE.  Grade  3  AEs  were  reported  in  38  patients  and  2  patients  had  Grade  4  events.  Of  the  38 
patients with a Grade 3 AE, 21 had a prior history of diabetes or a pre-diabetic condition. Both patients 
with  a  Grade  4  AE  had  impaired  glucose  tolerance  at  study  baseline.  In  the  majority  of  the  patients 
with  Grade  1  or  2  AEs  the  event  resolved  in  response  to  appropriate  medical  treatment.  In  fact, 
initiation  of  anti-hyperglycaemic  therapy  resulted  in  improvement  of  FPG  in  30  patients,  and  19 
patients  also  demonstrated  improvement  in  HbA1c.  Only  4  patients  with  Grade  1-2  AEs  were 
discontinued from the study due to the hyperglycaemic event and only 5 patients with Grade 3 events 
were discontinued due to the event. 
Of  the  2  patients  with  Grade  4  hyperglycaemia-related  AE  (hyperglycaemia  and  diabetes  mellitus),  1 
was discontinued due to hyperglycaemia and 1 patient was discontinued from the study due to lack of 
efficacy.  There  were  no  patients  with  a  hyperglycaemic  emergency  such  as  diabetic  ketoacidosis  or 
hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar state (hyperosmolar coma). 
The  incidence  of  hyperglycaemia  in  study  B2208  was  similar  to  that  observed  in  study  B2305  (study 
B2208: 35.9%; study B2305: 40.1%). 
In summary, hyperglycaemia-related events were the most frequently reported AEs of special interest. 
There  were  no  cases  of  hyperglycaemic  emergencies,  the  majority  of  the  cases  were  Grades  1  or  2, 
and there is evidence of improvement upon administration of anti-hyperglycaemic therapy.  
Page 62/90
 
 
 
 
 
The  adverse  effects  of  pasireotide  on  glucose  metabolism  are  expected  due  to  the  pharmacodynamic 
action  of  pasireotide  on  insulin  and  incretin  secretion.  As  glucose  metabolism  is  also  affected  by  the 
disease  per  se,  a  worsening  of  a  diabetic  or  pre-diabetic  state  can  be  expected.  It  is  therefore  of 
importance  that  patients  who  experienced  hyperglycaemia  could  be  successfully  treated  by  anti-
hyperglycaemic  therapy,  which  appears  to  have  been  the  case.  Corresponding  warnings  and 
recommendations have been included in the SmPC. 
Gastrointestinal AEs 
Gastrointestinal AEs (especially diarrhoea, nausea) are the most frequently reported events in patients 
treated with somatostatin analogues such as pasireotide. 
In study B2305, the incidence of diarrhoea-related AEs (preferred term: diarrhea) in the 600 µg b.i.d. 
and 900 µg b.i.d. treatment groups was similar (58.5% and 57.5%, respectively), and the majority of 
these  patients  had  events  that  were  suspected  to  be  related  to  study  drug  treatment.  Of  all  patients 
reported with diarrhoea in the Cushing’s disease dataset, there were 5 patients with Grade 3 diarrhoea 
in study B2305 and 1 patient in study B2208.  
Nausea was a consistent finding in all safety datasets. The proportions of patients with nausea-related 
AEs  (preferred  terms:  nausea,  vomiting)  were  higher  in  the  900  µg  b.i.d.  group  (57.5%)  than  in  the 
600 µg b.i.d. group (47.6%). Nausea-related AEs were mostly Grade 1-2 and considered study drug-
related.  The  proportions  of  patients  for  whom  nausea  was  reported  as  an  AE  were  similar  in  the 
Cushing’s  disease  studies:  51.9%  in  study  B2305,  30.8%  in  study  B2208  and  63.2%  in  study 
B2208E1.  
There were 3 patients in study B2305 who discontinued due to diarrhoea-related AEs and two patients 
discontinued due to nausea. Nausea was more common in the higher dose group. It may therefore be 
discussed  if  the  lower  dose  should  be recommended  as  starting  dose  in  order  to  minimise  the  risk  of 
discontinuation due to adverse events. 
Gall bladder and biliary-related AEs 
Gallbladder and biliary-related AEs occurred in 34.6% of all patients and were reported at comparable 
frequencies in the 600 µg b.i.d. and 900 µg b.i.d. groups. Most of the AEs were suspected to be related 
to study drug and were Grade 1-2.  
Cholelithiasis was the most frequent preferred term and was reported overall for 30.2% of patients in 
study  B2305.  Most  AEs  were  asymptomatic,  Grade  1  to  2,  and  were  detected  during  the  scheduled 
ultrasound examinations. One patient discontinued due to this AE. With respect to studies B2208 and 
B2208E1, 2 patients reported cholelithiasis in the extension study.  
In  the  acromegaly,  carcinoid  syndrome,  and  healthy  volunteer  populations,  the  incidence  of 
cholelithiasis was lower than that observed in the Cushing’s disease dataset.  
Cholelithiasis is a well known adverse event with somatostatin analogue treatment. 
Cortisol withdrawal syndrome/hypocortisolism 
Cortisol  withdrawal  syndrome  (hypocortisolism)  was  noted  at  a  low  frequency  in  study  B2305,  with 
hypocortisolism-related AEs being reported in 13 patients (8%). All but 1 of the cases resolved with a 
reduction or temporal interruption in pasireotide dose (pasireotide was discontinued in 1 patient), while 
3  patients  received  a  short-term  course  of  exogenous  steroid  treatment.  In  all  patients,  marked 
reductions in UFC level were observed; in patients with a decrease in pasireotide dose, maintenance of 
UFC normalization in these cases was observed.

Hypocortisolism is a recognized AE associated with any successful pituitary-directed therapy, including 
surgery.  The  rapid,  complete,  or  near  complete  supression  of  the  hypersecretion  of  ACTH  by  the 
adenoma  results  in  decreased  circulating  levels  of  cortisol  and  may  potentially  lead  to  transient 
hypocortisolism/hypoadrenalism, as the normal corticotrophs have been chronically inhibited. Although 
this  is  an  identified  risk,  the  occurrence  further  strengthens  the  notion  that  a  recommendation  to 
introduce therapy with pasireotide at a lower dose than proposed by the Applicant may be preferable. 
Corresponding warnings and recommendations for monitoring have been added to the SmPC. 
Pituitary hormonal deficiency 
Except for the pituitary-thyroid axis, deficiencies in pituitary hormonal axes have not been particularly 
studied  in  the  pasireotide  development  programme  so  far  but  are  expected  in  this  population  due  to 
previous pituitary surgeries and/or radiation therapy. Additionally, due to the mechanism of action of 
pasireotide (as for other somatostatin analogues) inhibition of other hormones (i.e. GH and insulin-like 
growth  factor-1  [IGF-1])  has  been  observed  in  several  studies  performed  during  pasireotide 
development. 
Of  particular  note,  7  patients  had  hypothyroidism-related  AEs  (preferred  terms:  hypothyroidism, 
thyroxine-free  decreased)  in  study  B2305;  all  of  these  patients  had  a  thyroid-stimulating  hormone 
(TSH) level close to the lower limit or at the lower end of normal at study entry. Hypothyroidism was 
not reported as an AE in study B2208 or its extension B2208E1. 
Hypopituitarism  is  an  identified  risk  with  pasireotide  treatment.  In  the  studies  investigating  the 
pharmacodynamics  of  pasireotide  in  healthy  volunteers,  no  effect  was  observed  on  thyroid  hormone 
levels  whereas  suppression  of  GH  could  be  seen.  The  SmPC  has  been  amended  to  include  adequate 
warnings, and long-term effects on GH will be followed as part of the RMP. 
QT prolongation 
AEs related to QT prolongation were observed in 8.0% of all patients in study B2305, and occurred at 
comparable  frequencies  in  the  600  µg  b.i.d.  and  900  µg  b.i.d.  groups.  One  patient  in  study  B2305 
discontinued  due  to  an  AE  of  QT  prolongation.  No  arrhythmias  related  to  QT  prolongation  were 
reported. 
The SmPC has been amended with adequate warnings. 
Bradycardia-related AEs 
In study B2305, bradycardia-related AEs were reported in 14.2% of patients. AEs of bradycardia were 
not  associated  with  clinical  findings  and  were  not  associated  with  adverse  clinical  outcomes.  In  study 
B2208, sinus bradycardia was reported in 1 patient with an SAE of myocardial infarction. 
In the acromegaly dataset, sinus bradycardia was reported in 10 patients but was not reported as an 
AE in any of these cases. 
Bradycardia  has  been  described  also  for  other  somatostatin  analogues  and  the  SmPC  has  been 
amended to include adequate warnings in this regard. 
Liver safety-related AEs 
Liver  safety-related  AEs  occurred  in  16.0%  of  all  patients  in  study  B2305.  Across  all  studies  in  the 
Cushing’s  disease  dataset,  the most  commonly  reported  liver  safety-related  AE  was  an increase  in γ-
glutamyltransferase (GGT) levels.  
In  study  B2305,  increases  in  alanine  aminotransferase  (ALT)  and  aspartate  aminotransferase  (AST) 
were  reported  as  AEs  for  17  patients  (10.5%)  and  9  patients  (5.6%),  respectively.  Liver  function 
abnormalities (primarily GGT level increases) were responsible for the discontinuation of 6 patients. In 
Page 64/90
 
 
 
studies B2208 and B2208E1, ALT increases were reported for 3 patients (there were no patients with 
increases in AST), and no patient discontinued due to a liver function. Most of the AEs in both studies 
were Grade 1-2 and resolved with minimal action taken.  
Although  six  patients  discontinued  due  to  increased  liver  function  tests,  the  adverse  events  were 
generally mild. The SmPC has been amended to include adequate warnings. 
Haematological abnormalities 
In the Cushing’s disease dataset, AEs related to low blood cell or coagulation were infrequent, and the 
majority of these AEs were Grade 1. In study B2305, AEs related to low blood cells (including anemia) 
were reported for 5.6% of patients, and coagulation-related AEs were reported for 1.9% of patients.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
The rate of SAEs was comparable between the two study groups with a tendency for more drug-related 
SAEs in the higher dose group. No deaths were reported within the study period.

Overall,  24.7%  of  all  patients  experienced  at  least  1  SAE.  The  frequencies  of  SAEs  were  comparable 
between the two treatment groups. SAEs leading to discontinuation did not cluster in any specific SOC 
but occurred in several SOCs with maximal 2 patients in each.  
The most common SAE in both dose groups was pituitary-dependent Cushing’s syndrome (3.7% of all 
patients); 3 patients in the 600 μg b.i.d. group and 3 patients in the 900 μg b.i.d. group (Table 17). 
Minor differences were observed between the two groups in terms of SAE frequencies;  in the 900 μg 
b.i.d.  group  diabetes  mellitus,  hyperglycaemia  and  adrenal  insufficiency  occurred  slightly  more  often. 
Conversely, cholelithiasis was reported slightly more frequently in the 600 μg b.i.d. group.

Cushing’s disease reported as a SAE 
There were 9 patients for whom a SAE of “Pituitary-dependent Cushing’s syndrome”, “Pituitary tumour 
benign”  or  “Secretory  adenoma  of  pituitary”  was  reported.  Eight  of  these  patients  were  discontinued 
from  the  study  and  then  had  surgical  interventions  (pituitary  surgery  or  bilateral  adrenalectomy)  for 
the  treatment  of  Cushing’s  disease,  for  which  they  were  hospitalized  within  30  days  of  treatment 
discontinuation;  these  events  were  considered  as  SAEs  due  to  the  hospitalization.  For  1  patient,  the 
SAE “Pituitary tumour benign” was the underlying reason for an SAE of nerve paralysis and was thus 
reported as a SAE as well. 
None of these SAEs were considered related to the study drug by the investigator.  
The  Cushing’s  disease  SAEs  reported  indicate  that  some  patients  were  included  that  eventually  were 
reconsidered for pituitary surgery; furthermore these SAEs indicate that in some patients the effect of 
pasireotide was not satisfactory. However, these SAEs appear not to be related to the study drug. 
SAEs suspected to be study drug-related 
A  total  of  19  patients  (11.7%)  had  study  drug-related  SAEs;  7  patients  (8.5%)  in  the  600  μg  b.i.d. 
group  and  12  patients  (15.0%)  in  the  900  μg  b.i.d.  group.  No  SAE  was  reported  for  more  than  4 
patients (2.5%) in total. 
The  most  frequent  study  drug  related  SAEs  were  related  to  glucose-metabolism  (9  patients)  and 
cholelithiasis (4 patients). SAEs related to glucose metabolism occurred slightly more frequently in the 
900  μg  b.i.d.  group,  whereas  cholelithiasis  was  slightly  more  frequent  in  the  600  μg  b.i.d.  group  as 
described below. 
Cholelithiasis was reported for 3 patients (3.7%) in the 600 μg b.i.d. group and 1 patient (1.3%) in the 
900 μg b.i.d. group. 
A total of 8 patients had SAEs leading to discontinuation; 3 patients (3.7%) in the 600 μg b.i.d. group 
and 5 patients (6.3%) in the 900 μg b.i.d. group. No SAE leading to discontinuation was reported for 
more than one patient and SAEs did not cluster in any specific SOC (maximal 2 patients reported SAEs 
in  any  given  SOC).  SAEs  leading  to  discontinuation  in  the  600  μg  b.i.d.  group  were  lipase  increased, 
diabetes mellitus, and pregnancy, and in the 900 μg b.i.d. group were adrenal insufficiency, pituitary-
dependent  Cushing’s  syndrome,  ECG  QT  prolonged,  hyperglycemia,  pituitary  tumour  benign,  cranial 
nerve paralysis, and tongue paralysis. 
None  of  the  SAEs  that  were  considered  to  be  study  drug  related  were  unexpected  but  were  mostly 
related to the pharmacodynamic effect of pasireotide. It should be noted that one patient in the high 
Page 66/90
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
dose group discontinued due to adrenal insufficiency, which further support the recommendation of a 
lower starting dose. 
Deaths 
No  deaths  were  reported  in  the  clinical  database.  However,  two  cases  of  death  were  reported  to  the 
sponsor’s safety department. One patient died during the screening period due to dementia, pituitary 
tumour  and  hypotension.  The  patient  had  not  received  any  treatment  with  pasireotide.  The  other 
patient  died  approximately  2  months  after  the  last  dose  of  pasireotide  due  to  post-surgical 
complications after bilateral adrenalectomy. SAE narratives have been provided for both cases. None of 
the reported deaths were related to the study drug. 
In the remaining clinical development programme, one death was reported from the phase II study in 
carcinoid syndrome [Study B2202] due to tumour progression (neoplasm) and liver failure. The patient 
experienced  progressive  liver  failure  with  hyperbilirubinemia  and  cholestasis.  The  cause  of  death  was 
reported to be due to disease progression; a relationship to study drug was not suspected. 
No other deaths were reported from any of the other studies included in this submission.

Summary of Results 
Patients with Cushing’s disease have a known predisposition for hyperglycaemia, which was observed 
in this study. 
Following  the  initial  increase  in  FPG  (peaking  at  month  1)  the  FPG  levels  decreased  in  both  groups. 
HbA1c increased within 2 months and remained stable at that level for the duration of the study. 
At  Month  12,  the  adjusted  mean  change  (95%  CI)  from  baseline  in  FPG  was  27.98  mg/dL  (14.57  to 
41.39)  in  the  600 μg  b.i.d.  group  and  25.09  mg/dL  (11.73  to  38.45)  in  the 900 μg  b.i.d.  group.  The 
adjusted  mean  change  from  baseline  were  similar  between  the  two  groups,  except  for  the  Day  15, 
Month 1 and Day 45 time points where the adjusted mean difference tended to be higher in the 900 μg 
b.i.d. group. 
At Month 12, the adjusted mean change (95% CI) from baseline in HbA1c was 1.61% (1.31 to 1.91) in 
the  600  μg  b.i.d.  group  and  1.55%  (1.25  to  1.86)  in  the  900  μg  b.i.d.  group.  The  adjusted  mean 
change from baseline was similar between the two groups. 
Patients who achieved mUFC ≤ ULN in the 600 μg b.i.d. randomized dose group had lower increases in 
glycaemic measures (FPG and HbA1c) than any other clinical response subgroup. 
In  patients  with  Cushing’s  disease  whose  baseline  HbA1c  level  <7%  and  were  not  receiving  any 
antidiabetic  medication  at  baseline  treatment  with  pasireotide  s.c.  for  a  year  results  in  moderate 
increases  in  FPG  and  HbA1c  with  no  differences  between  dose  groups.  In  contrast,  there  was  a 
tendency  for  all  other  ‘diabetic’  patients  at  study  entry  (N=42)  to  experience  more  noticeable 
increases, particularly in HbA1c, following treatment with the 900 μg b.i.d. dose. 
Following treatment with anti-diabetic medication, FPG levels showed a decrease, whilst HbA1c levels 
did not. The HbA1c increases should, however, be viewed with caution due to several limitations in the 
way the data were collected which preclude any firm conclusions. 
Hyperglycaemia  related  AEs  were  frequently  reported  in  both  treatment  groups.  No  clear  dose 
dependency was observed.

It  is  estimated  that  glucose  intolerance  and  frank  diabetes  affect  20-60%  of  patients  with  Cushing’s 
disease.  The  following  comments  are  assessed  from  the  submitted  documentation  on  glucose 
metabolism and hyperglycaemia-related events: 
-  Hyperglycaemia was reported in preclinical studies in rats; 
-  Hyperglycaemia-related events are related to inhibition of insulin secretory capacity and occur with 
increasing doses; 
-  Hyperglycaemia  is  more  significant  in  patients  with  a  history  of  hyperglycaemia  and  diabetes 
mellitus prior to pasireotide treatment; 
-  During phase 2 and phase 3 studies, hyperglycaemia was an AE frequently reported, notably grade 
1  and  2  with  relatively  few  grade  3  and  4;  SAE  and  discontinuations  due  to  AE  related  to 
hyperglycaemia were also reported. 
Page 68/90
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
-  In a phase 3 study, the increase in FPG and HbA1c is to be noticed: adjusted mean changes in FPG: 
27.98  mg/dl  in  600  µg  and  25.09  mg/dl  in  900  µg  b.i.d.  group;  HbA1c:  1.61%  and  1.55%, 
respectively,  in  two  groups  of  treatment.  It  can  be  agreed  that  the  adjusted  mean  changes  from 
baseline in FPG and HbA1c levels were similar between 2 groups of treatment, however, with regard 
to the mean values, neither mean FPG nor mean HbA1c returned to the levels before treatment in 
any group of patients (those whose baseline HbA1c was <7% and did not receive any anti-diabetic 
medication  at  baseline  and  those  whose  FPG  was  >100  mg/dL  at  baseline  and  whose  HbA1c  was 
>7%). The levels of FPG and HbA1c remained increased after the discontinuation of the study drug. 
-  The  applicant  has  performed  a  study  (B2124)  to  define  potential  role  of  different  class  of  anti-
hyperglycaemic agents in the management of hyperglycaemia. Although the study duration of only 
one  week  is  clearly  insufficient,  this  study  gives  some  insight  on  the  different  responses  to  these 
anti-diabetic  medications  in  the  treatment  of  pasireotide  induced  hyperglycaemia.  At  least  in  HV 
(with normal insulin sensitivity) metformin showed a very modest effect, whereas the secretagogue 
nateglinide  and  the  incretin  enhancers  vildagliptin  and  liraglutide  showed  more  prominent  effects 
with high reporting of gastrointestinal adverse events for liraglutide.  
-  Hyperglycaemic  effect  was  less  pronounced  in  patients  with  acromegaly  and  carcinoid  syndrome 
than in Cushing’s patients. 
Overall,  hyperglycaemia-related  AEs  were  frequently  reported  during  the  development  programme  of 
pasireotide.  These  AEs  were  observed  in  118  (72.8%)  patients  in  the  pivotal  study  and  were  more 
significant  in  patients  with  a  history  of  hyperglycaemia  and  diabetes  mellitus  prior  to  pasireotide 
treatment. The percentage of patients taking anti-diabetic treatment significantly increased during the 
pivotal  study.  However,  no  collection  of  data  on  concomitant  medications  was  performed.  This  is  of 
concern notably for the assessment of information on anti-diabetic treatment of patients who reached 
the FBG threshold for treatment intervention. 
In the pivotal study, the increase in FPG and HbA1c levels is notable without return to the levels before 
pasireotide treatment in any group of patients.  Hyperglycaemia appears to stabilise over time and the 
observed  improvement  in  other  risk  factors  may  in  part  out-weigh  the  risk  connected  with  the 
increased  HbA1c.  The  optimal  therapy  in  pasireotide  induced  hyperglycaemia  remains  to  be 
established, however, current guidelines for the management of diabetes are considered sufficient. The 
Applicant  has  proposed  specific  precautions  for  use  that  appear  necessary  in  these  patients.  No 
situations where the use of pasireotide should be contraindicated have been identified. The SmPC has 
been  amended  to  guide  prescribers  in  the  management  of  hyperglycaemic  events,  including 
recommendations on the follow-up required with regard to glucose metabolism. 
Moreover, long-term risk of hyperglycaemia and risks for ketoacidosis or coma are not known as well 
as risk of use of pasireotide in a larger population; these issues will be followed as part of the RMP. 
Clinical chemistry 
In the Cushing’s disease dataset, GGT, ALT, AST, and lipase increases were frequently noted as newly 
occurring  laboratory  abnormalities;  most  of  these  abnormalities  were  Grade  1  or  2.    No  newly 
occurring  or  worsened  Grade  4  biochemistry  abnormalities  were  observed  in  study  B2305,  but  there 
were  1  patient  in  study  B2208  and  2  patients  in  study  B2208E1  with  Grade  4  values.  There  were  no 
patients with concurrent elevations ALT or AST > 3 x ULN and bilirubin ≥ 2 x ULN. 
In the acromegaly dataset a Grade 4 increase was reported for 1 patient in study B2201 (triglycerides) 
and  3  patients  in  study  B2201E1  (alpha-amylase,  glucose,  and  lipase).  In  the  carcinoid  syndrome 
population,  Grade  4  abnormalities  were  noted  for  calcium  increase  (1  patient),  AST  elevation  (1 
patient)  and  glucose  elevation  (2  patients).  While  laboratory  abnormalities  in  these  populations  were 
typically Grade 1-2, they were sporadic in occurrence and did not require treatment for resolution. In 
Page 69/90
 
 
 
the  healthy  volunteer  dataset,  three  subjects  showed  liver  test  abnormalities  fulfilling  the  Hy’s  law 
criteria. All subjects were asymptomatic and the events resolved upon discontinuation of medication. 
Elevations  of  liver  enzymes  have  been  observed  throughout  the  clinical  study  programme.  The 
observed changes appear manageable, however, monitoring of liver function is warranted. Warnings in 
this  regard  have  been  included  in  the  SmPC  as  well  as  a  contraindication  in  patients  with  severe 
hepatic impairment. Lipase increases are expected due to the pharmacodynamic action of pasireotide. 
Fasting blood glucose and HbA1c 
Elevations  in  glucose  levels  were  the  most  frequently  reported  Grade  3  laboratory  abnormality  study 
B2305; the frequency of Grade 3-4 fasting blood glucose and HbA1c abnormalities was slightly higher 
in the 900 µg b.i.d. treatment group than that reported for patients receiving 600 µg b.i.d. pasireotide.  
Diabetic  patients  tended  to  have  larger  increases  in  FPG  and  HbA1c  relative  to  non-diabetic  patients 
and  tended  to  have  larger  increases  in  FPG  and  HbA1c  on  900  µg  b.i.d.  relative  to  600  µg  b.i.d. 
Although the 600 and 900 µg b.i.d. ‘diabetic’ groups contain a relatively small number of patients, the 
tendencies  for  larger  increases  in  glycaemic  parameters  with  900  µg  b.i.d.  appeared  to  be  clinically 
meaningful.  Within  the  limitations  of  the  analysis,  there  is  clear  evidence  for  improvement  in  these 
measures as detailed in the shift tables and effect on FPG after intervention with anti-hyperglycaemic 
medications.  
The increase in blood glucose is expected due to the pharmacodynamic action of pasireotide. This is of 
concern due to the fact that this patient group is prone to have a high prevalence of diabetes due to 
long-standing hypercortisolism. Warnings in this regard have been included in the SmPC. 
Hematology 
Abnormalities in hemoglobin were frequently seen in studies B2305, B2208, and B2208E1; these were 
mostly  Grade  1.  In  both  acromegaly  and  carcinoid  patients,  the  most  commonly  occurring 
abnormalities  were  in  hemoglobin  and  absolute  lymphocytes.  In  study  B2305,  hemoglobin 
abnormalities were more frequent in the 900 µg b.i.d. group than in the 600 µg b.i.d. group. With the 
exception of 1 patient in study B2305 who had Grade 3 hemoglobin abnormality, no further Grade 3 or 
4 hemoglobin abnormalities were reported in any of the Cushing’s studies presented in this submission. 
In study B2305, Grade 4 abnormalities were only reported for lymphocytes (1 patient) and neutrophils 
(2 patients); infrequent Grade 3 abnormalities in hemoglobin and were also noted. The most frequently 
reported  abnormalities  were  partial  thromboplastin  time  and  international  normalized  ratio  (INR),  of 
which  a  Grade  1  abnormality  was  reported  for  33.3%  and  20.0%  of  all  patients,  respectively.  In  the 
600 μg b.i.d. group there were 5 patients with a Grade 3 partial thromboplastin time. Three of these 
patients also had Grade 3 INR. In the 900 μg b.i.d. group 1 patient had a Grade 3 INR, and none had 
Grade  3  partial  thromboplastin  time.  There  were  no  patients  in  either  group  with  Grade  4  partial 
thromboplastin time or INR. 
No Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities were noted in studies B2208 and B2208E1. 
While no Grade 3 or 4 hematology abnormalities were noted in the acromegaly and healthy volunteer 
populations, there were 2 patients with Grade 3 absolute lymphocyte count at higher dose ranges (i.e. 
between 900 and 2400 µg b.i.d. pasireotide) in the carcinoid syndrome patient population. 
No clinically significant hematology changes were evident in any of the healthy volunteer studies. 
Urine analysis 
No clinically relevant findings for any of the clinical studies included in this submission were observed. 
ECGs 
Page 70/90
 
 
 
The complete evaluation of the QT prolongation across the entire pasireotide development programme 
included  central  re-reading  of  all  (available)  locally  read  (i.e.  machine  derived  values)  ECGs.  The 
percentage of healthy volunteers with notable post-baseline QTcF interval values was low. Overall, the 
percentage  of  patients  with  notable  post-baseline  QTcF  interval  values  was  low:  new  QTcF  >  480 
ms=1.2%  (3/257);  new  QTcF  >  500  ms=0.8%  (2/257)  and  QTcF  change  from  baseline  >  60 
ms=1.9% (5/258). No episodes of Torsade de Pointes were observed in the Cushing’s disease studies 
or in any other patient populations.  
The QTcF outlier analysis for study B2305 revealed similar findings relative to that observed across the 
pasireotide development programme i.e. few outlier values (n=3 events > 480 ms; n= 2 events > 500 
ms,  and  n=5  events  for  changes  from  baseline  of  > 60  ms)(note  that  the  exclusion  criteria  allowed 
patients  with  baseline  QTcF  of  up  to  480  ms  to  enrol).  None  of  the  QTcF  values  >  480  ms  were 
associated  with  any  reported  AEs  nor  required  any  medical  intervention  or  interruption  of  study 
medication.  In  addition,  these  events  appeared  to  be  sporadic  (not  related  to  duration  of  exposure) 
and  asymptomatic.  In  addition,  no  discernable  pattern  of  AEs  was  evident,  and  no  dose  dependency 
was observed.  
Therefore,  the  central  tendency  changes  in  QTcF  observed  from  study  B2113  did  not  appear  to 
correlate  with  a  higher  occurrence  of  categorical  outliers  in  either  B2305  or  across  the  entire 
pasireotide development program as might be expected from a drug that prolonged QT/QTc. 
In  the  supportive  Cushing’s  disease  studies  B2208  and  B2208E1,  no  patients  with  a  QTcF  or  QTcB 
value > 480 ms were observed.  
In the acromegaly carcinoid syndrome, and healthy volunteer populations, no clinically significant ECG 
abnormalities were reported. 
Since  the  target  population  can  be  expected  to  be  at  a  high  cardiovascular  risk  due  to  longstanding 
hypercortisolism the prescriber has to be made aware of this potential risk. Appropriate warnings have 
been included in the SmPC. 
Vital signs, body weight, and physical examinations 
Minor fluctuations in blood pressure and body weight were noted, but there were no abnormalities that 
were  considered  to  be  clinically  relevant.  As  discussed  in  the  efficacy  section,  the  majority  of  the 
observed changes were related to improvement of the clinical symptoms of the disease. 
Gallbladder ultrasonography 
Gallbladder ultrasonography was performed in a number of studies supporting the current submission. 
No  clinically  relevant  observations  with  respect  to  gallstone  or  sludge  frequency  were  observed. 
However,  gallstones  or  sludge  were  observed  during  the  ultrasound  evaluation  at  a  slightly  higher 
frequency  after  pasireotide  treatment  compared  to  baseline  in  the  Cushing’s  disease  dataset  and  the 
acromegaly  population.  No  gallbladder  ultrasonography  was  performed  in  the  carcinoid  dataset.  No 
clinically  relevant  changes  were  seen  in  the  healthy  volunteer  population.  Gallstones  and  sludge 
formation is a well known adverse effect of somatostatin analogue treatment. 
Safety in special populations 
Demographics 
Population pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses of pasireotide suggest that race, ethnicity, gender, and liver 
function  do  not  influence  PK  parameters.  The  covariate  effects  of  age  and  body  weight  are  found  to 
influence PK parameters, but considered not to be clinically relevant.  
Elderly patients 
Page 71/90
 
 
 
Age  has  been  found  to  be  a  covariate  in  the  population  PK  analysis  of  Cushing’s  disease  patients. 
Decreased total body clearance and increased PK exposures have been seen with increasing age. The 
AUC  at  steady  state  for  one  dosing  interval  of  12  hours  (AUCss)  is  predicted  to  be  increased 
moderately (25%) when age increased from 18 to 73 years. This increase is moderate and considered 
of  minor  significance  considering  the  wide  age  range  in  which  the  effect  was  observed.  Data  on 
Cushing’s  disease  patients  older  than  65  years  of  age  are  limited  but  do  not  suggest  any  clinically 
significant differences in safety in relation to younger patients. 
Paediatric patients 
No studies have been performed in pediatric patients. 
Patients with renal impairment 
Clinical  studies  have  not  been  performed  in  patients  with  impaired  renal  function.  However,  renal 
clearance  has  a  minor  contribution  to  the  elimination  of  pasireotide  in  humans.  Renal  function  is  not 
expected to significantly impact the circulating levels of pasireotide. 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
In  study  B2114  in  subjects  with  impaired  hepatic  function  (Child-Pugh  A,  B  and  C),  statistically 
significant  differences  were  found  only  in  subjects  with  severe  hepatic  impairment.  These  results 
indicate that hepatic impairment has a moderate impact on the PK profile of pasireotide and is unlikely 
to require dose modification. 
Regarding patients with hepatic impairment, one specific safety study was performed in patients with 
different  levels  of  hepatic  impairment.  This  study  (B2114)  showed  significant  differences  only  in 
patients  with  severe  hepatic  impairment.  Results  of  PK  data  indicate  that  hepatic  impairment  has  a 
moderate impact on the PK profile of pasireotide and is unlikely to require dose modification. However, 
in the pivotal B2305 Study, 6 patients discontinued treatment due to hepatic adverse events. Based on 
these overall data, appropriate warnings have been added to the SmPC as well as a contra indication in 
patients with severe hepatic impairment. 
Patients with established glucose metabolism disorders 
In the pivotal study in patients with Cushing’s disease, patients who had either baseline HbA1c ≥ 7% 
or  were  taking  an  anti-diabetic  medication  prior  to  randomization  tended  to  have  higher  mean 
elevations in FPG and HbA1c relative to patients with a baseline HbA1c < 7% and not taking any anti-
diabetic medication prior to randomization. 
Patients with disorder of pituitary function 
Deficiency  of  pituitary  secreted  hormones  is  common  sequelae  of  transsphenoidal  surgery  and  even 
more  frequently  post-radiation  therapy  of  the  pituitary  gland.  Cushing’s  disease  patients  with 
persistent or recurrent disease might therefore present with deficiency of multiple pituitary hormones. 
As  the  pharmacological  activity  of  pasireotide  mimics  that  of  somatostatin,  inhibition  of  pituitary 
hormones, other than ACTH, cannot be disregarded. In study B2305 in patients with Cushing’s disease, 
hypothyroidism was reported for 7 patients but all presented with a TSH close to the lower limit or at 
the  lower  end  of  normal  at  study  entry  which  precluded  establishing  a  direct  causal  effect  with 
pasireotide. 
Pregnancy, lactation and fertility 
Regarding experimental data, effects on female fertility were observed. In the peri-post-natal toxicity 
study, a slight retardation in the development of rats was noted. 
Page 72/90
 
 
 
The potential risk for humans is unknown since there is no clinical experience. Only 2 pregnancies have 
been reported.  
Immunological events 
The  presence  of  antibodies  was  reported  in  preclinical  studies  in  rats.  No  analysis  on  immunological 
events  or  research  on  antigenicity  has  been  conducted  in  humans.  However,  in  clinical  studies, 
hypersensitivity  and  allergic  reactions  were  reported.  Injection  site  reactions  were  also  reported  very 
frequently  in  the  pivotal  Study  B2305  (13.6%  of  patients).  With  regard  to  immunological  events  in 
Cushing’s  disease,  3  patients  had  an  AE:  1  grade  1  allergy  to  chemicals,  and  2  grade  2  drug 
hypersensitivity,  not  considered  as  related  to  study  drug.  With  regard  to  injection  site  reactions 
reported, they are within what could be expected for a medication given subcutaneously. There were 
no findings correlating to the non-clinical findings of fibromas. Injection site reactions will be followed 
as outlined in the RMP. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Drug-drug interactions are discussed in the clinical pharmacology part of this report. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
There  did  not  appear  to  be  a  difference  in  the  incidence  of  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  in  study 
B2305  between the 2 doses (15.9% and 18.8%, respectively, for the 600 and 900  µg b.i.d. groups). 
The most common AEs leading to discontinuation overall were GGT increased (3 patients [3.7%] in the 
600  μg  b.i.d.  group  and  2  patients  [2.5%]  in  the  900  μg  b.i.d.  group),  hyperglycaemia  (2  patients 
[2.4%]  in  the  600  μg  b.i.d.  group  and  3  patients  [3.8%]  in  the  900  μg  b.i.d.  group),  and  diabetes 
mellitus  (2  patients  [2.4%]  in  the  600  μg  b.i.d.  group  and  2  patients  [2.5%]  in  the  900  μg  b.i.d. 
group).  
In the other studies comprising the Cushing’s disease dataset, there were 2 patients who discontinued 
due to an AE, and in both cases these were related to glucose metabolism: 1 patient in study B2208 
(hyperglycaemia)  and  1  patient  in  study  B2208E1  (type  2  diabetes  mellitus).  The  data  from  study 
B2124 indicate that incretin enhancers may be more efficient than insulin secretagogues or biguanides 
in the treatment of pasireotide induced hyperglycaemia. 
In the acromegaly patient population, AEs related to glucose metabolism were the most frequent AEs 
leading  to  study  discontinuation:  2  patients  in  study  B2201  and  3  patients  in  study  B2201E1 
discontinued  as  a  result  of  a  glucose-metabolism-related  AE.  In  contrast,  AEs  related  to 
gastrointestinal  disorders  were  the  most  common  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  in  the  carcinoid 
syndrome  population  (hyperglycaemia  was  reported  as  an  AE  leading  to  discontinuation  for  only  1 
patient).  
Nine  subjects  had  AEs  leading  to  study  discontinuation  in  the  healthy  volunteer  dataset;  however, 
these were distinct from those reported in all other datasets. 
AEs requiring dose adjustment or interruption 
Nausea,  diarrhoea,  hyperglycaemia,  and  adrenal  insufficiency  were  the  most  common  AEs  requiring 
dose adjustment or interruption in study B2305. A total of 55 patients had at least 1 AE requiring dose 
adjustment or study drug interruption; 31 patients (37.8%) in the 600 µg b.i.d. group and 24 patients 
(30.0%)  in  the  900  µg  b.i.d.  group.  Apart  from  adrenal  insufficiency,  these  findings  were  consistent 
with observations in study B2208; however, each AE was only reported for 1 or 2 patients. 
Page 73/90
 
 
 
The most commonly occurring adverse events were often of a magnitude calling for dose adjustments. 
The treatment should be started at lower dose levels in order to increase tolerability. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  safety  data  available  indicate  that  the  safety  profile  is  largely  similar  to  that  seen  with  other 
somatostatin  analogues  with  a  predominance  of  gastrointestinal  adverse  reactions.  No  unexpected 
adverse events have been detected during the development programme. 
The safety assessment is limited by the rather small number of patients treated with pasireotide. Out 
of the 201 patients with Cushing’s disease treated with pasireotide, 122 patients were exposed for at 
least 6 months, 70 patients were exposed for at least 12 months and 17 patients were exposed for at 
least  24  months.  The  long-term  experience  is  thus  limited.  In  addition,  safety  data  from  studies  in 
patients with acromegaly and carcinoid syndrome have been provided by the Applicant. The main focus 
of this assessment is however on the Cushing’s disease safety population. 
Almost  all  patients  experienced  an  adverse  event, 159  out  of  162  studied  patients  with a  majority  of 
AEs that were study drug-related (95.7%). The number of Grade 3 or 4 AEs was high occurring in one 
half of patient population (48.8%). The number of serious AEs occurred also in high number of patients 
(40 patients: 24.7%). 
Gastrointestinal  and  glycaemia  related  adverse  events  were  most  common  as  could  be  expected 
compared with other somatostatin analogues. Notably not only hyperglycaemia but also hypoglycaemia 
was  reported.  There  was  no  apparent  relationship  with  dose  but  adverse  events  were  comparable 
between the two doses.  
Twenty  adverse  events  of  special  interest  based  on  potential  safety  concerns  identified  in  the  non-
clinical  programme  as  well  as  adverse  events  expected  with  the  somatostatin  analogue  class  were 
defined by the Applicant. One of these selected adverse events was injection site reactions, and it may 
be  concluded  that  these  events  were  within  the  range  that  could  be  expected  for  a  subcutaneously 
injected drug. 
The  adverse  effects  of  pasireotide  on  glucose  metabolism  are  expected  due  to  the  pharmacodynamic 
action  of  pasireotide  on  insulin  secretion  and  incretins.  Hyperglycaemia  was  also  one  of  the  most 
common  reasons  for  discontinuation  due  to  adverse  events  both  in  the  Cushing  and  acromegaly 
populations.  This  is  of  concern  due  to  the  fact  that  the  target  patient  group  is  prone  to  have  a  high 
prevalence  of  diabetes  due  to  long-standing  hypercortisolism.  It  is  therefore  of  importance  that 
patients  who  experienced  hyperglycaemia  could  be  successfully  treated  by  anti-hyperglycaemic 
therapy  which  appears  to  have  been  the  case.  The  data  from  study  B2124  indicate  that  incretin 
enhancers  may  be  more  efficient  than  insulin  secretagogues  or  biguanides  in  the  treatment  of 
pasireotide  induced  hyperglycaemia.  However,  hepatobiliary  adverse  events  were  observed  with  the 
combination of liraglutide and pasireotide. The available data does not allow for any recommendations 
beyond  those  already  given  in  current  guidelines  on  the  treatment  of  diabetes.  Warnings  concerning 
hyperglycaemic events have been included in the SmPC.  
Octreotide, another somatostatin analogue already authorised, was used in the study B2201 involving 
60  patients  with  acromegaly.  However,  this  study  was  not  comparative;  it  was  an  open-label, 
randomized, crossover study in patients treated with octreotide 100 µg t.i.d. for 28 days following by 
pasireotide 200, 400 and 600 µg b.i.d. for 28 days each. Total treatment duration was 16 weeks. Even 
though  no  direct  comparison  between  octreotide  and  pasireotide  was  provided  as  the  treatment 
periods  were  different,  it  can  be  pointed  out  that  more  AEs  were  reported  during  the  phases  with 
pasireotide  treatment  than  during  the  phase  with  octreotide:  86.7%  vs  60%;  hyperglycaemia  was 
Page 74/90
 
 
 
reported  in  8.3%  of  patients  treated  with  pasireotide  vs  1.7%  (1  pts)  with  octreotide;  increase  of 
HbA1c was reported in 6.7% et diabetes mellitus in 5% of patients vs 0% with octreotide. 
As known from the use of other somatostatin analogues, diarrhoea and nausea were common and may 
limit the use of pasireotide. Nausea was more common in the higher dose group. Cholelithiasis is a well 
known adverse event with somatostatin analogue treatment and was also observed with pasireoide. 
Hypocortisolism  was  reported  in  almost  10  %  of  patients  and  is  an  identified  risk  with  pasireotide 
treatment, however, only one patient discontinued due to hypocortisolism. 
Hypopituitarism  is  another  identified  risk  with  pasireotide  treatment.  In  the  studies  investigating  the 
pharmacodynamics  of  pasireotide  in  healthy  volunteers,  no  effect  was  observed  on  thyroid  hormone 
levels  whereas  suppression  of  GH  could  be  seen.  Adverse  events  related  to  hypothyroidism  were 
reported  in  patients  with  low  or  normal  thyroid  function  at  study  entry.  However,  the  impact  of 
pasireotide  therapy  on  this  and  other  pituitary  axes  has  not  been  discussed.  The  potential  impact  on 
the  safety  profile  of  inhibition  of  pituitary  hormones  other  than  ACTH  has  been  explored  by  the 
Applicant. Pasireotide does not seem to alter the levels of thyrotropin or free T4. However, long-term 
effects  on  GH  and  IGF-1  levels  in  patients  with  Cushing’s  disease  have  not  been  studied  and  thus 
cannot  be  ruled  out.  The  issue  of  long-term  inhibition  of  pituitary  hormones  is  adequately  covered  in 
the SmPC with recommendations for periodical monitoring of pituitary function.  
The  SmPC  has  been  amended  to  include  adequate  warnings  regarding  potential  effects  on  TSH  and 
GH; however, long-term effects on GH should be followed as part of the RMP.  
In  the  thorough  QT  study  an  effect  of  pasireotide  on  QT  was  observed,  however,  although  the 
evaluation  of  ECGs  with  regard  to  QT  prolongation  revealed  sporadic  cases  of  QT  prolongations  no 
events  with  arrhythmias  were  reported.  Bradycardia  has  been  described  for  other  somatostatin 
analogues  and  was  observed  in  about  15  %  of  patients;  however,  in  no  case  the  bradycardia  was 
associated  with  clinical  symptoms.  Since  the  target  population  can  be  expected  to  be  at  a  high 
cardiovascular risk due to longstanding hypercortisolism, the prescriber has to be made aware of this 
potential risk. Warnings in this regard have been included in the SmPC.  
The rate of SAEs was comparable between the two study groups with a tendency for more drug-related 
SAEs in the higher dose group. However, due to the small numbers, no firm conclusion can be drawn 
with regard to differences between the two doses. No unexpected SAEs were reported. 
There were SAEs related to Cushing’s disease, apart from lack of effect, these SAEs appear not to have 
been related to the study drug. 
Among  the  SAEs  that  were  considered  to  be  study  drug  related  none  was  unexpected  and  they  were 
mostly related to the pharmacodynamic effect of pasireotide. It should be noted that one patient in the 
high-dose group discontinued due to adrenal insufficiency.  
None of the two reported deaths were related to the study drug. 
With regard to laboratory parameters, elevations of liver enzymes have been observed throughout the 
clinical study programme. Although six patients discontinued treatment due to increased liver function 
tests, the adverse events were generally mild. In the healthy volunteer dataset, three subjects showed 
liver  test  abnormalities  fulfilling  the  Hy’s  law  criteria.  All  subjects  were  asymptomatic  and  the  events 
resolved  upon  discontinuation  of  medication.  The  observed  changes  appear  manageable,  however, 
monitoring of liver function is warranted. Warnings in this regard have been included in the SmPC. The 
SmPC, has been amended to include recommendations on actions to take if elevated liver enzymes are 
detected. The use of pasireotide in patients with severe hepatic impairment has been contraindicated. 
Page 75/90
 
 
 
Lipase  increases  were  also  observed  and  are  expected  due  to  the  pharmacodynamic  action  of 
pasireotide.  Changes  in  hematology  parameters  were  observed  but  were  generally  mild.  No  clinically 
relevant changes in clinical chemistry parameters or urine analysis were observed. 
Due to the size of the study, no meaningful analysis of safety related to gender, age or ethnicity could 
be  made.  A  single  dose  of  pasireotide  given  to  patients  with  hepatic  impairment  did  not  reveal  any 
unexpected  adverse  reactions.  Hyperglycaemia  was  the  most  commonly  reported  event  in  this 
population. 
In  the  pivotal  study  a  rather  large  proportion  of  patients  discontinued  treatment  due  to  adverse 
events.  Furthermore,  the  efficacy  data  indicate  that  some  patients  may  respond  to  lower  doses  than 
the recommended starting dose of 900 μg b.i.d. In order to minimise the risk of discontinuations due 
to adverse events a lower starting dose is now recommended in the SmPC.  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety data-base is limited due to the small size of the pivotal study. The safety profile, however, 
appears  comparable  to  that  of  other  somatostatin  analogues  and  thus  this  limitation  could  be 
acceptable.  The  most  important  adverse  reactions  observed  were  gastrointestinal  events  and 
hyperglycaemia.  In  the  pivotal  study,  the  increase  in  FPG  and  HbA1c  is  noteworthy.  With  regards  to 
the  mean  values,  neither  mean-FPG  nor  mean-HbA1c  returned  to  the  levels  before  pasireotide 
treatment  in  any  group  of  patients.  The  levels  of  FPG  and  HbA1c  remained  increased  after 
discontinuation of the study drug. Long-term risk of hyperglycaemia and risks of ketoacidosis or coma 
are  not  known  as  well  as  the  risks  of  use  of  pasireotide  in  a  larger  population.  Further  data  on  the 
management of pasireotide induced hyperglycaemia from study B2124 indicate that incretin enhancers 
may  be  the  best  option  in  the  treatment  of  pasireotide  induced  hyperglycaemia;  however  the  safety 
profile of the combinations has to be taken into account. 
Other  important  identified  risks  that  need  further  observation  are  the  effects  on  QT  prolongation  as 
well  as  the  observed  increased  incidence  of  bradycardia.  The  potential  long-term  effect  on  pituitary 
hormones, especially GH suppression, could be followed in post-approval studies. Treatment has been 
shown to cause hypocortisolism in some cases which may be handled by dose reduction or temporary 
discontinuation. 
The  Applicant  is  recommended  to  perform  a  post-marketing  surveillance  study,  to  further  document 
the  safety  and  efficacy  of  pasireotide  s.c.  in  patients  with  Cushing’s  disease  (CSOM230B2410).  The 
final  protocol  has  been  included  in  the  RMP  and  the  RMP  pharmacovigilance  plan  has  been  updated 
accordingly.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
In Cushing’s disease, hypercortisolism is caused by ACTH producing pituitary adenomas. The first line 
therapy  is  pituitary  surgery;  however,  the  recurrence  rate  is  high  also  in  the  hands  of  experienced 
neurosurgeons.  Another  option  is  pituitary  irradiation  which  has  the  disadvantage  of  slow  onset  of 
effect 
in  combination  with  effects  on  all  other  pituitary  hormones,  eventually  causing 
panhypopituitarism. There is currently no medical therapy available across the EU. The drugs currently 
used in the treatment of hypercortisolism all share a negative safety profile, making them less suitable 
for  long-term  treatment.  Thus  there  is  an  unmet  medical  need  for  new  medical  therapies  for  the 
treatment of Cushing’s disease. 
Pasireotide  is  a  new  somatostatin  analogue  with  a  different  binding  pattern  to  the  somatostatin 
receptors compared to the currently available somatostatin analogues octreotide and lanreotide. In the 
pivotal  study  (B2305)  162  patients  were  randomised  to  receive  either  600  μg  b.i.d.  or  900  μg  b.i.d. 
The  primary  endpoint  was  responder  rates,  where  responders  were  defined  as  patients  who  had 
normalised  their  mean  UFC  evaluated  after  six  months  of  treatment  with  the  hypothesis  that  a lower 
bound  of  the  95  %  CI  above  15 %  response  rate  would  represent  a  clinically  relevant  effect. 
Normalisation of mean UFC is an important measure as it is expected to translate into alleviation of the 
clinical signs and symptoms of Cushing’s disease. Responder rates are therefore considered a clinically 
relevant measure of efficacy. 
The response rates in the pivotal study were 26.3 % (95 % CI; 16.6, 35.9) and 14.6 % (95 % CI; 7.0, 
22.3)  for  the  900  and  600 μg  b.i.d.  doses,  respectively. Since hypercortisolism,  whatever  UFC  value, 
leads  to  an  increase  in  morbidity  and  mortality  the  aim  of  treatment  should  be  the  normalisation  of 
mUFC. However, also partial response is expected to be of clinical relevance. When partial responders 
(showing  at  least  50  %  reduction  of  their  mUFC  compared  to  baseline)  were  included,  the  response 
rate was 41 % for the higher dose and 34 % for the lower dose.   
All secondary and exploratory endpoint outcomes supported the primary endpoint including beneficial 
and  clinically  relevant  effects  on  objective  parameters  such  as  blood  pressure,  weight  and  Quality  of 
Life  as  well  as  data  suggesting  that  pituitary  tumour  volume  decreases  during  treatment.  This  was 
seen  both  in  patients  who  were  complete  and  partial  responders.  Thus,  the  efficacy  of  pasireotide  is 
considered to have been adequately shown.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
Efficacy  data  is  only  available  up  to  12  months  of  treatment,  although  these  data  indicate  that  the 
effect is maintained. The rate of discontinuation was particularly high in the pivotal trial. Only 48% of 
the  randomised  patients  completed  the  study  at  12  months  with  the  main  cause  of  discontinuation 
being unsatisfactory therapeutic effect (25.3%). However, in the group of patients who were partial or 
complete responders, the drop-out rate was considerably lower (31.6 % at month 12) compared to the 
non-responder group (69.3 % at month 12). 
The  long-term  effects  will  have  to  be  followed  as  post-authorisation  measures.  The  Applicant  will 
perform a post-marketing surveillance study, to further document the safety and efficacy of pasireotide 
s.c.  in  patients  with  Cushing’s  disease  (CSOM230B2410).  The  final  protocol  has  been  included  in  the 
RMP and the RMP pharmacovigilance plan has been updated accordingly. 
Page 85/90
 
 
 
Due to the relatively high rate of non-responders it is considered important that non-responders could 
be  detected  early.  The  data  shows  that  more  than  80  %  of  patients  who  had  not  responded  at  2-3 
months of treatment were still non-responders at month 6; therefore patients that do not benefit from 
treatment can be identified early. This issue is adequately reflected in the SmPC and recommendations 
on when to discontinue treatment are provided.  
Due  to  the  statistical  design  of  the  study  no  formal  comparison  was  made  between  the  two  doses 
investigated.  The  study  groups  were  imbalanced  with  regard  to  the  baseline  mUFC  (higher  values  in 
the group randomised to the 600 μg b.i.d. dose), which may have affected the outcome of the primary 
endpoint. The totality of data indicates that the lower dose may be as effective as the higher dose in 
some  patients.  Further,  the  increase  in  pasireotide  dosages  did  not  translate  into  better  efficacy 
especially  when  increasing  the  dose  beyond  900  μg  b.i.d.  Among  the  36  patients  concerned  by  dose 
increases only 3 experienced UFC normalization, however, additional reductions of mUFC was observed 
when the dose was increased from 600 μg b.i.d to 900 μg b.i.d. Based on the fact that some patients 
did respond to the lower dose, this dose is now recommended as the starting dose in the SmPC with an 
option to uptitrate to the higher dose. 
Factors  that  could  differentiate  patients,  who  may  or  may  not  respond  to  treatment,  have  not  been 
established at the present time. The characteristics (biological or clinical) of patients who would benefit 
from  pasireotide  treatment  are  still  unknown  but  will  be  further  explored  in  the  non-interventional 
post-marketing study. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The  safety  profile  of  pasireotide  appears  comparable  to  that  seen  for  other  somatostatin  analogues. 
The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal (diarrhoea and nausea, 54.9 % and 46.9 %, 
respectively)  and  metabolic  (hyperglycaemia,  38.9  %).  The  adverse  events  clearly  affect  the 
tolerability  and  caused  a  rather  large  number  of  discontinuations  (15.9  %  and  18.8  %  of  patients  in 
the  low  and  high  dose,  respectively).  Hyperglycaemia  is  of  concern  due  to  the  fact  that  the  target 
patient  group  is  prone  to  have  a  high  prevalence  of  diabetes  due  to  long-standing  hypercortisolism. 
The  data  suggests  that  hyperglycaemia  in  most  cases  can  be  successfully  managed  by  anti-diabetic 
treatment. A short-term study (B2124) has investigated different anti-diabetic therapies in pasireotide 
induced hyperglycaemia. However, the importance of the high incidence of hyperglycaemia needs to be 
followed.  The  Applicant  is  recommended  to  perform  study  B2219 to  further  examine  the  optimal 
management  of  hyperglycaemia.  In  this  regard,  the  Applicant  is  recommended  to  provide  a 
complete protocol to the CHMP before the start of the study, and to provide the results when available. 
Cholelithiasis  is  a  well  known  adverse  reaction  of  somatostatin  analogue  treatment  and  was  also 
observed with pasireotide in 30 % of the patients. 
Hypocortisolism was reported for almost 10 % of the patients and is an identified risk with pasireotide 
treatment. 
Hypopituitarism  is  another  identified  risk  with  pasireotide  treatment.  In  the  studies  investigating  the 
pharmacodynamics  of  pasireotide  in  healthy  volunteers,  no  effect  was  observed  on  thyroid  hormone 
levels  whereas  suppression  of  GH  could  be  seen.  Adverse  events  related  to  hypothyroidism  (4.3  %) 
were reported in patients with low or normal thyroid function at study entry.  
Two  thorough  QT  studies  have  been  performed,  both  indicating  that  pasireotide  may  cause  QT-
prolongation  and  sporadic  cases  were  observed  also  in  the  clinical  programme.  QT-prolongation  and 
bradycardia have been described also for other somatostatin analogues.

Increases in liver function tests were observed for 16 % of patients in the pivotal study; however these 
increases  were  generally  mild.  Increases  in  liver  functions  test  were  also  observed  in  asymptomatic 
healthy  volunteers,  all  these  events  resolved  once  medication  was  discontinued.  A  PK  study  was 
performed  in  patients  (without  Cushing’s  disease)  with  different  levels  of  hepatic  impairment  on  the 
effects  of  pasireotide  on  hepatic  function.  Results  showed  significant  differences  only  in  patients  with 
severe  hepatic  impairment.  Moreover,  in  the  pivotal  study  B2305,  6  patients  discontinued  treatment 
due  to  hepatic  adverse  events.  Based  on  these  overall  data,  a  dose  adjustment  for  patients  with 
moderate hepatic impairment as well as recommendations regarding monitoring of liver function have 
been  included  in  the  SmPC.  Adequate  recommendations  regarding  actions  to  take  if  elevated  liver 
enzymes are observed have been included. Furthermore, the use of pasireotide in patients with severe 
hepatic impairment has been contraindicated. 
Injection  site  reactions,  of  a  type  and  severity  to  be  expected  with  a  subcutaneously  injected  drug, 
were reported by 13.6 % of the patients in the pivotal study. 
No unexpected adverse events were reported in the clinical programme.  
The identified risks are all considered possible to handle by following the information in the SmPC; the 
risks should further be followed as outlined in the RMP. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Due to the fact that Cushing’s disease is a rare disease the safety database is small comprising of only 
201 patients with Cushing’s disease, whereof only 70 patients have been treated for up to 12 months. 
Thus it is not possible to detect uncommon adverse events. Therefore post-approval follow-up will be 
needed. 
The long-term effects of pasireotide on GH suppression are not known and will have to be followed as a 
post-authorisation measure. The Applicant will perform a post-marketing surveillance study, to further 
document  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  pasireotide  s.c. 
in  patients  with  Cushing’s  disease 
(CSOM230B2410).  The  final  protocol  has  been  included  in  the  RMP  and  the  RMP  pharmacovigilance 
plan has been updated accordingly. 
No  drug  interaction  studies  have  been  performed  and  in  general  the  interaction  potential  for 
pasireotide appears low from a pharmacokinetic point of view but there are some issues identified that 
may necessitate complementary in vivo interaction studies. Furthermore, interactions with antidiabetic 
agents  are  expected  from  a  pharmacodynamic  perspective.  Data  from  the  study  B2124  indicate  that 
incretin enhancers may be the best choice in the treatment of pasireotide induced hyperglycaemia, and 
that the combinations tested are tolerated. However, hepatobiliary adverse events were seen with the 
combination  pasireotide  and  liraglutide  and  the  available  data  are  not  deemed  sufficient  to  make 
recommendations regarding this combination. The data from B2124 also indicate that metformin may 
not  be  efficient  in  the  treatment  of  pasireotide  induced  hyperglycaemia.  Available  data,  however,  is 
insufficient  to  give  any  recommendations  that  go  beyond  current  guidelines  for  the  treatment  of 
diabetes. Adequate information in this regard is given in the SmPC. 
Non-clinical competition binding experiments showed that pasireotide binds with high affinity to human 
somatostatin  receptor  subtypes  sst1,  sst2,  sst3,  and  sst5.  The  affinity  for  sst1  and  sst5  is  30  to  40 
times higher, and the affinity to sst3 is 5 times higher than the affinity of octreotide, while the affinity 
for  sst2  was  somewhat  lower  and  equal  to  octreotide.  Thus,  the  binding  data  demonstrates  that  the 
mechanism  of  action  for  pasireotide  is  somewhat  different  from  that  of  octreotide,  mainly  regarding 
affinity  to  the  sst5  receptor  subtype,  which  has  a  fairly  large  distribution  in  the  heart.  Therefore, 
pharmacodynamically  mediated  adverse  cardiac  reactions  different  from  those  observed  with 
octreotide may be expected. Currently available published data does not allow for any conclusions on 
Page 87/90
 
 
 
this  issue.  The  Applicant  is  recommended  to  further  explore  whether  the  cardiac  effect  of  pasireotide 
(bradycardia,  QT  prolongation)  pertain  to  any  explorable  ancillary  properties  (If,  somatostatin 
receptors)  by  means  of  relevant  models  and  to  report  the  outcome  to  CHMP  as  post-authorisation 
measures. 
No specific study was performed in specific populations such as elderly, patients with renal and hepatic 
failure, children, pregnant and breast feeding women. 
Pasireotide antibodies were detected in an antigenicity study of pasireotide LAR in the 6-cycle rat. No 
investigations  of  antibodies  and  thus  their  potential  impact  on  efficacy  have  been  conducted  in 
humans.  Thus,  no  formal  conclusion  can  be  drawn,  but  with  regard  to  the  injection  site  reactions 
reported, they are within what could be expected for a medication given subcutaneously. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Cushing’s  disease  is  a  rare  and  life-threatening  disorder  associated  with  an  increase  of  mortality  and 
morbidity. At the present time, no medicinal treatment is registered that could be helpful especially in 
the  event  of  recurrence  or  persistence  of  the  disease  after  surgery,  or  when  surgery  is  impossible. 
Reducing the hypercortisolism in these patients is of outmost importance in order to protect them from 
the  co-morbidities  associated  with  this  condition  such  as  cardiovascular  disease,  diabetes  and 
osteoporosis. In that context, the development and approval of a new therapy is important. 
The  overall  clinical  programme  showed  that  pasireotide,  due  to  its  pharmacological  properties  as 
somatostatin analogues, is effective in reducing UFC and even normalising UFC in a relevant proportion 
of patients suffering from Cushing’s disease. These effects have also been observed on other biological 
parameters  considered  as  markers  of  the  disease  and  its  evolution.  Pasireotide  seems  to  be  also 
effective in improving signs and symptoms and Quality of Life in some patients.  
Further  characterisation  of  responders  to  treatment  is  not  possible  based  on  the  available  data; 
however,  responders  to  treatment  could  be  identified  after  the  two  first  months  of  treatment  after 
which treatment can be discontinued in non-responders. 
With regard to the risks of this new treatment, the safety profile of pasireotide was partly the same as 
the  safety  profile  of  other  somatostatin  analogues;  hypocortisolism,  hyperglycaemia,  bradycardia, 
cholelithiasis,  haematological  abnormalities,  liver  enzymes  increased  and  injection  sites  reactions. 
Further,  a  QT  prolongating  effect  of  pasireotide has  been  observed.  The  SmPC  has  been  amended  to 
adequately cover these identified risks. Taking into consideration that the target population is expected 
to be under close surveillance by specialists in endocrinology, liver safety could be handled by routine 
pharmacovigilance and will also be followed in the planned post-marketing study. Appropriate warnings 
have been added to the SmPC as well as a contraindication in patients with severe hepatic impairment. 
Hyperglycaemia  events  were  reported  with  high  rates.  These  events,  however,  are  manageable  if 
current  treatment  guidelines  are  applied  and  in  view  of  the  fact  that  adequate  information  has  been 
included in the SmPC. The long-term evolution and management will have to be followed as part of the 
RMP.  
Taking  the  low  response  rate  into  account  the  wording  of  the  indication  has  been  strengthened  to 
clarify that pasireotide is a second line therapy to surgery. 
The  initial  marketing  authorisation  application  for  Signifor  was  submitted  for  a  product  in  pre-filled 
syringes.  However,  during  the  procedure,  translucent,  “flake  like”  visible  particles  were  found  in  pre-
filled syringes, for which the initial application was submitted. The cause of forming the particles was 
Page 88/90
 
 
 
identified as combination of silicone coating of the syringes and stoppers and damage of the stoppers 
by gamma-irradiation. The applicant decided to replace the pre-filled syringes by ampoules. As all data 
submitted for the ampoules were satisfactory, this solution was accepted.  
However, since the current packaging (glass ampoules) is not considered optimal by the CHMP, the 
Applicant is recommended to submit an application seeking approval of pasireotide solution for 
injection in pre-filled syringes as soon as appropriate stability data are available, and to keep the CHMP 
informed on the progress of these stability studies.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
From a clinical point of view the benefits of Signifor (pasireotide) in the treatment of Cushing’s disease 
are considered to outweigh the risks. Thus, the benefit-risk balance of Signifor is positive.  
4. Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considers  by  consensus 
that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Signifor  in  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  Cushing’s  disease  for 
whom  surgery  is  not  an  option  or  for  whom  surgery  has  failed,  is  favourable  and  therefore 
recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for palbociclib, the scientific conclusions 
of the CHMP are as follows: 
In view of available data on venous thromboembolism from the literature, clinical trials, spontaneous reports 
including 531 cases with a close temporal relationship, and in view of a possible class effect for CDK4/6 
inhibitors, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between palbociclib and venous tromboembolism is at 
least a reasonable possibility.  
Furthermore, in view of available data on Palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (PPES) from clinical 
trial(s), the literature, spontaneous reports including in some cases a close temporal relationship, a positive 
de-challenge and/or re-challenge and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers a 
causal relationship between palbociclib and PPES is at least a reasonable possibility.  
The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing palbociclib should be amended 
accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s)  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for palbociclib the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product containing palbociclib is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the 
product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) should be varied.

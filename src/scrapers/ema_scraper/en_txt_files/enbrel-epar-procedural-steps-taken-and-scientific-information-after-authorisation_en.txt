etanercept has been detected at low levels in human milk. 
Etanercept could be considered for use during breast 
feeding taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for 
the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. 
While systemic exposure in a breastfed infant is expected 
to be low because etanercept is largely degraded in the 
gastrointestinal tract, limited data regarding systemic 
exposure in the breastfed infant are available. Therefore, 
the administration of live vaccines (e.g., BCG) to a 
breastfed infant when the mother is receiving etanercept 
could be considered 16 weeks after stopping breast-feeding 
(or at an earlier timepoint if the infant etanercept serum 
levels are undetectable).

Of the 127 patients in the parent study (Study B1801014) 
characteristics (SmPC) in order to update clinical 
information based on final results obtained from the 
clinical paediatric study B1801023 (CLIPPER 2). Also, 
the Risk management plan (RMP) was brought up to 
date with version 7.6. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to

data 
109 participated in the open-label extension study (Study 
B1801023 – CLIPPER 2) and were followed for 8 years. The 
extension study was designed to further characterise the 
long-term safety profile, including malignancy and other 
safety adverse events (SAEs), and clinical benefit for those 
paediatric subjects who received at least 1 dose of 
etanercept and completed approximately 96 weeks of 
etanercept treatment in the parent study. At the end of the 
extension study 84/109 (77%) patients had completed the 
study; 27 (25%) while actively taking Enbrel, 7 (6%) had 
withdrawn from treatment due to low/inactive disease; 5 
(5%) had re-started Enbrel following an earlier withdrawal 
from treatment, and 45 (41%) had stopped Enbrel (but 
remained under observation); 25/109 (23%) patients 
permanently discontinued from the study. Improvements in 
clinical status achieved in the parent study were generally 
maintained for all efficacy endpoints during the entire 
follow-up period. Patients actively taking Enbrel could enter 
an optional withdrawal-retreatment period once during the 
extension study based on investigator’s judgment of clinical 
response. 30 patients entered the withdrawal period. 17 
patients were reported to have a flare (defined as ≥ 30% 
worsening in at least 3 of the 6 ACR Pedi components with 
≥ 30% improvement in not more than 1 of the remaining 6 
components and a minimum of 2 active joints); median 
time to flare after Enbrel withdrawal was 190 days. 13 
patients were re-treated and the median time to re-
treatment from withdrawal was estimated as 274 days. Due 
to the small number of data points, these results should be

interpreted with caution. 
The safety profile of the extension study (Study B1801023 
– CLIPPER 2) was consistent with that observed in the 
parent study (Study B1801014).

Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Submission of the second 5-year report from the 
British Society for Rheumatology Biologics Register 
(BSRBR, also referred as study B1801309) listed as a 
category 3 study in the RMP. This is a prospective 
3 study in Enbrel RMP) addressed the following safety 
concerns: malignancy; serious and opportunistic infections; 
central demyelinating disorders; aplastic anaemia; 
congestive heart failure; acute ischemic cardiovascular 
events. 
The review showed that the results are consistent with the 
current overall safety profile of etanercept in the approved

A review of cervical cancer risk was also performed by the 
MAH including data from other registries. A total of 102 
cases of cervical cancer (20 from BSRBR, 2 from RABBIT 
and 76 from ARTIS registries) were retrieved in the 
etanercept exposed cohorts. The results of the analyses 
showed that the incidence rate in the Enbrel-exposed group 
was not significantly higher than the comparator group 
(csDMARD). PRAC agreed that no causal association could 
be established between cervical cancer and etanercept. The 
MAH should continue to monitor cervical cancer events 
using routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
Overall, no new safety concerns were identified and no 
amendments to the product information are warranted in 
this variation.

open-label study which evaluated withdrawal and 
retreatment of etanercept in subjects with non-
radiographic axial spondyloarthritis who achieved an 
adequate response following 24 weeks of treatment. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to make 
some editorial changes and bring the PI in line with 
the latest QRD template version 10.1. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to

data 
retreatment of Enbrel in patients with active non-
radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-AxSpa) who 
achieved an adequate response following 24 weeks of 
treatment.  
At week 24, 119 (57%) patients achieved inactive disease 
and entered into the Period 2 40-week withdrawal phase 
where subjects discontinued etanercept, yet maintained the 
background NSAID. The primary measure of efficacy was 
the occurrence of flare (defined as an ASDAS erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate (ESR) greater than or equal to 2.1) 
within 40 weeks following withdrawal of Enbrel. Patients 
who flared were retreated with Enbrel 50 mg weekly for 12 
weeks (Period 3). 
In Period 2, the proportion of patients experiencing ≥1 flare 
Page 6/81 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
increased from 22% (25/112) at week 4 to 67% (77/115) 
at week 40. Overall, 75% (86/115) patients experienced a 
flare at any time point within 40 weeks following 
withdrawal of Enbrel.  
The key secondary objective of Study 2 was to estimate 
time to flare after withdrawal of Enbrel and additionally 
compare the time to flare to patients from Study 1 who met 
the Study 2 withdrawal phase entry requirements and 
continued Enbrel therapy.   
The median time to flare following withdrawal of Enbrel was 
16 weeks (95% CI: 13-24 weeks). Less than 25% of 
patients in Study 1 who did not have treatment withdrawn 
experienced a flare over the equivalent 40-weeks as in 
Period 2 Study 2. The time to flare was statistically 
significantly shorter in subjects who discontinued Enbrel 
treatment (Study 2) compared to subjects who received 
continuous etanercept treatment (Study 1), p < 0.0001. 
Of the 87 patients who entered Period 3 and were retreated 
with Enbrel 50 mg weekly for 12 weeks, 62% (54/87) 
reachieved inactive disease, with 50% of them reachieving 
it within 5 weeks (95% CI: 4 8 weeks, KM analysis). 
The trend of clinical improvement in Period 1, worsening in 
Period 2, and improvement in Period 3 was observed across 
clinical measures.

The primary objective of this British Association of 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Submission of the final report from study (B1801311 
- BADBIR) listed as a category 3 study in the RMP. 
This is a prospective cohort study that compared 
patients treated with biologic interventions 
(etanercept, adalimumab, and ustekinumab) and 
patients with similar disease characteristics but 
exposed only to conventional non-biologic systemic 
therapies. 
C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority 
Dermatologists Biologics and Immunomodulators Register 
(BADBIR) was to investigate the long-term safety outcomes 
of psoriasis patients treated with biologic therapy. The data 
were collected during the observation of psoriasis patients 
treated with etanercept and conventional therapy who were 
registered in the BADBIR register between 01 September 
2007 and 31 July 2018. As of the 31st of July 2018, 1811 
patients were registered with the etanercept cohort 
(n=1379, 76%) or have switched to etanercept from 
another biologic therapy (n=432, 24%), and 5346 patients 
were registered for the conventional cohort. Patients were 
recruited into the etanercept cohort from 123 centres 
across the UK and the Republic of Ireland. 
The analyses indicated a significantly increased risk of 
serious infection (aHR 1.79; 95% CI 1.37,2.33), respiratory 
(aHR 2.42; 95% CI 1.18, 4.95), cardiac (aHR 1.63; 95% CI 
1.04, 2.57), nervous system (aHR 2.18; 95% CI 1.32, 
3.61), skin (non-cancer; aHR 1.55; 95% CI 1.07, 2.24) and 
malignant events (aHR 1.49; 95% CI 1.13, 1.95) for those 
psoriasis patients currently or previously receiving 
etanercept. Within these categories, psoriasis patients 
currently or previously receiving etanercept had a 
significantly increased risk of pneumonia (aHR 1.68; 95% 
CI 1.02, 2.77), septicaemia (aHR 2.78; 95% CI 1.21, 
6.39), cellulitis (aHR 2.28; 95% CI 1.19, 4.37), other 
serious infection (aHR 1.93; 95% CI 1.33, 2.79), other 
cardiac (aHR 1.79; 95% CI 1.06, 3.04), other nervous

system (aHR 1.92; 95% CI 1.12, 3.30), skin cancer (aHR 
1.75; 95% CI 1.15, 2.66) and solid tumours (aHR 1.52; 
95% CI 1.06, 2.19). A greater incidence of pregnancies 
was reported for female patients receiving etanercept 
during follow-up when compared to those receiving 
conventional therapy (aHR 1.93; 95% CI 1.14, 3.26). No 
other events differed significantly between those receiving 
conventional therapy and those receiving etanercept. 
The findings of the analyses suggest that patients exposed 
to etanercept have an increased risk of developing serious 
infections, respiratory, cardiac, nervous system and skin 
(non-cancer) serious adverse events (SAEs), and 
malignancies as compared with those exposed to 
conventional treatment after adjusting for potential 
confounders. The generalisation and external validity of this 
study results are limited due to the presence of potential 
bias, notably confounding by indication.  
Overall, these findings are consistent with the known safety 
profile of etanercept in the treatment of adult psoriasis. 
These reported risks have been well characterised through 
the risk management plan and are listed in the product 
information. No new safety concerns were identified. 
Overall, the results presented in this application are 
consistent with previous reported data and do not warrant 
amendment to the product information.

whom (87.5%, 28/32) completed a 24-week course of 
therapy. The reasons for not completing a course of 
therapy were treatment being ineffective (3 patients) and 
lost to follow-up (1 patient). Of these 32 patients, 16 
required more than one treatment period with other 
systemic therapies, mostly with other systemic biologics. 
Decrease in severity of plaque psoriasis after treatment 
with etanercept based on the judgment of the investigator 
was observed in 30/32 patients. The effectiveness data 
were too limited to draw conclusions.

The RABBIT register is an on-going long-term observational 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Submission of the final report from study (RABBIT 
register Cohort 2) listed as a category 3 study in the 
RMP. This is a prospective, non-interventional, 
observational, long-term cohort Germanic biologics 
register to evaluate the long-term effectiveness, 
safety, and costs associated with tumour necrosis 
factor (TNF)-inhibitor therapies in the treatment of 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in comparison to cohorts of 
RA patients treated with conventional synthetic 
disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) 
and biologic (b)DMARDs. 
C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority 
cohort study initiated in Germany in 2001. A total of 
10,919 patients with RA were considered for the analyses. 
At enrolment, patients of the three exposure groups 
(Enbrel (n=1,537), other bDMARDs (n=6,030), csDMARDs 
(n=3,349)) had a mean age of 57 - 59 years, and 73 - 
75% of the patients were female. Patients treated with 
Enbrel were comparable to patients treated with other 
bDMARDs in terms of some disease characteristics. 
The fully adjusted analysis of the complete cohort of the 
RABBIT register did not reveal a negative impact of Enbrel 
on the outcomes of hospitalisations due to infection and 
pneumonia. After adjustment for available confounders, 
hazard ratios (HR) for stroke were significantly lower in 
patients treated with Enbrel compared to csDMARDs (on 
drug: HR=0.5 (95% CI 0.3; 0.9)). No effect of Enbrel on 
the outcomes of myocardial infarction, coronary artery 
disease and incident heart failure was observed. There was 
no significant association between patients currently 
exposed (on drug + 3 months risk window) or ever 
exposed to Enbrel and the risk for overall and first 
malignancies, lung cancer, lymphoma, malignant 
melanoma and NMSC. Thus, a reduced risk was seen for 
breast cancer in the group of Enbrel in the ever exposed 
analysis HR=0.5 (95% CI 0.2; 0.97)). Furthermore, a non-
significantly elevated risk of leukaemia was revealed for 
Enbrel users relative to csDMARD treated patients (ever 
exposed: HR 1.9 (95% CI 0.7; 5.3)). Mortality risk was 
significantly reduced in patients currently receiving Enbrel 
(on-drug plus 3-months risk window: HR=0.6 (95%CI 0.4; 
0.8)), but the result did not persist in the ever exposed 
approach. The spectrum of adverse pregnancy in patients 
Page 13/81 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
receiving Enbrel did not differ from the other treatment 
groups. There were low numbers of tuberculosis, 
opportunistic infections, worsening of heart failure, 
glioblastoma, cervical cancer and central demyelination, 
and therefore no adjusted risks for these events were 
analysed. 
Results showed a reduced risk for stroke, breast cancer and 
mortality relative to csDMARD users. In this analysis no 
association with other safety events, including infections, 
cardiovascular outcomes and malignancy, were identified.  
Overall the results of this study do no suggest any new 
safety concerns for etanercept and are in line with the 
known safety profile for etanercept. No changes to the 
product information are deemed necessary as a 
consequence of the findings of this study.

with etanercept compared to patients with the same 
diseases of interest who were treated with non-
biologic systemic drugs, but without etanercept or 
population-based, multi-country, observational cohort 
register study using merged data from Sweden, Denmark

study comparing the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in 
women exposed to etanercept during the first 90 days of 
pregnancy (n=425) to those exposed to non-biologic drugs 
(n=3497), there was no observed increased risk of major 
birth defects (crude odds ratio [OR]= 1.22, 95% CI: 0.79-
1.90; adjusted OR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.58-1.60 after 
adjusting for country, maternal disease, parity, maternal 
age and smoking in early pregnancy). This study also 
showed no increased risks of minor birth defects, preterm 
birth, stillbirth, or infections in the first year of life for 
infants born to women exposed to etanercept during

failure’ has been split into ‘worsening of cardiac failure 
congestive’ with a frequency’ uncommon’ and ‘new cardiac 
onset cardiac failure congestive’ with a frequency ‘rare’.  
In controlled clinical trials of etanercept across all 
indications, the frequency (incidence proportion) of 
interstitial lung disease in patients receiving etanercept 
without concomitant methotrexate was 0.06% (frequency 
rare). In the controlled clinical trials that allowed 
concomitant treatment with etanercept and methotrexate,

In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update

Furthermore, the PI is being brought in line with the

been detected in the serum of infants born to female 
patients treated with Enbrel during pregnancy based on two 
literature reviews indicating that Etanercept concentrations 
are found in maternal serum, cord blood and breast milk.  
No key safety information has been found in the Pfizer 
database and no safety signal was identified. The MAH’s 
proposal is based on published data and one report of a 
medically important adverse event (AE) of neonatal 
asphyxia. Therefore there is evidence in the scientific

Furthermore the Annex II is being brought in line

The data for these cases show there were very low levels of 
etanercept in infant serum suggesting that absorption of 
etanercept present in breast milk by the infant’s 
gastrointestinal system is possible. Thus, the proposed

review of the evidence concerning the association between 
administration of etanercept and the development of 
scleritis. Based upon the reports of positive dechallenge 
and rechallenge identified in the MAH’s pharmacovigilance 
database and the literature, and the fact that other forms 
of ocular inflammation, namely uveitis, are included in the 
current product information for etanercept, the inclusion of 
scleritis in the SmPC is considered justified. This is 
supported by the analysis of MarketScan data, in which 
prevalence estimates of scleritis for patients with 
inflammatory disease receiving etanercept are higher (with 
non-overlapping confidence intervals) than patients with 
inflammatory disease alone. Although it is possible that 
reports of scleritis could have been associated with greater 
disease severity in etanercept-treated patients, a causal 
association could not be ruled out. From the estimated 
exposure in double-blind and open label etanercept clinical 
trials scleritis falls under the CIOMS frequency category of 
“uncommon”.

were searched in the MAH's clinical trials' databases for 
cases of vasculitis and reported 42 cases of systemic 
vasculitis, from which an exposure adjusted event rate of

reports from the MAH database. Based on these data, a 
causal association to etanercept cannot be excluded. The 
cumulative clinical trial exposure for etanercept exceeds 
22600 individuals, and therefore, the estimated frequency

has identified 29 case reports in its database with features 
consistent with inflammatory bowel disease. Treatment 
indications were predominantly JIA (22 case reports).  The 
data provided by the MAH imply that that there could be 
increased risk of IBD associated with administration of 
etanercept to young patients for treatment of JIA. An

leukaemias and paediatric malignancies, it is agreed that 
there are a number of uncertainties regarding whether 
there is or not a causal association between the use of 
etanercept and the development of lymphomas, leukaemias 
or paediatric malignancies. Nevertheless, given the 
mechanism of action of TNF blocker agents, the risks for 
the development of such malignancies cannot be excluded. 
Therefore it has been included in the SmPC that, in the 
post-marketing setting, cases of leukaemia and 
malignancies in children, adolescents and young adults (up 
to 22 years of age) have been reported in patients treated 
with a TNF-antagonist, including etanercept. In paediatric 
patients approximately half the cases were lymphomas. 
The other cases represented a variety of different 
malignancies and included rare malignancies usually 
associated with immunosuppression. Overall, a risk for the 
development of malignancies in children and adolescents 
treated with TNF-blockers cannot be excluded. 
As there is a risk for lymphoma and leukaemia attributable 
to treatment with all TNF inhibitors, and that the risk 
applies equally to all authorised TNF inhibitors, section 4.8 
of the SmPC has been updated to include "lymphoma" and 
"leukaemia". 
Finally the ADR psoriasisis in section 4.8 has been 
expanded to include "worsening" of psoriasis.

term use of etanercept in the treatment of plaque psoriasis 
provides sustained efficacy and safety in the treatment of 
psoriasis with no evidence of increased toxicity. Thus, 
treatment beyond the current restriction of 24 weeks is 
supported, and provides a useful alternative to meeting the 
needs of patients. The removal of a time restriction for 
treatment courses in adult psoriasis is in line with other 
biological immunosuppressive therapies, many of which 
have a smaller safety database. No reliable predictive 
factors were identified, which would provide guidance to 
clinicians regarding those subjects who would be most 
appropriate for continuous therapy. Therefore, the decision 
to use intermittent or continuous therapy should be based

Package Leaflet 
to 2 February 2007), the Marketing Authorisation Holder 
provided a cumulative review of reports of interstitial lung 
disease (ILD) from clinical studies, spontaneous ADR 
reports and from the published literature.  A total of 252 
medically confirmed reports of ILD  (including pulmonary 
fibrosis and pneumonitis), which were reported in 
association with etanercept therapy have been reviewed. 
Many of the reports described a similar presentation of flu-
like symptoms or respiratory symptoms and negative lung 
cultures.  Many of the patients responded to steroid 
treatment; however some were associated with a fatal 
outcome.   Although many of the reports were confounded 
by past medical history of respiratory disorders and use of 
concomitant medications, there were spontaneous reports 
which suggested a causal association with etanercept 
therapy.  The estimated frequency of ILD was determined 
to be uncommon. Thus, section 4.8 of the SPC was updated 
to include the new adverse event "interstitial lung disease 
(including pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis)" under the 
new category "Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal

percentage of patients in whom antibodies to 
etanercept have been detected. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics 
extension EMEA/H/C/262/X/65 (Enbrel solution for injection 
in pre-filled syringes), the MAH presented data on anti-
etanercept antibodies from 5 long-term studies in subjects 
with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and psoriatic arthritis. 
This analysis showed that antibodies to etanercept have 
been detected in the sera of some subjects treated with 
etanercept. These antibodies have all been non-neutralising 
and were generally transient and there appeared to be no 
correlation between antibody development and clinical 
response or adverse events. 
In subjects treated with approved doses of etanercept in 
clinical trials for up to 12 months, cumulative rates of anti-
etanercept antibodies were approximately 6% of subjects 
with rheumatoid arthritis, 7.5% of subjects with psoriatic 
arthritis, 2.0% of subjects with ankylosing spondylitis, 7% 
of subjects with psoriasis, and 3% of subjects with juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis.  
The proportion of subjects who developed antibodies to 
etanercept in longer-term trials (of up to 3.5 years) 
increases over time, as expected. However, due to their 
transient nature, the incidence of antibodies detected at 
each assessment point was typically less than 7% in 
rheumatoid arthritis subjects and psoriasis subjects. In a 
long-term psoriasis study in which patients received 50 mg 
twice weekly for 96 weeks, the incidence of antibodies 
observed at each assessment point was up to

etanercept-treated patients who had chronic viral hepatitis 
prior to the Enbrel therapy.  This review identified reports 
on reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV), in patients who 
were chronic carriers of this virus, and reports of worsening 
of hepatitis C in patients receiving Enbrel. Patients at risk 
for HBV infection should be evaluated for prior evidence of 
HBV infection before initiating Enbrel therapy. Caution 
should also be exercised when administering Enbrel to 
patients identified as carriers of HBV. 
Since serious infections and cases of active tuberculosis 
have been reported in patients treated with Enbrel, 
recommendations, regarding the evaluation of patients for 
infections before, during and after Enbrel use, including 
screening and appropriate treatment for tuberculosis in all 
patients prior to initiating Enbrel therapy, have been added 
to the Enbrel SPC. 
The text in section 4.4 of the SPC has been re-organised 
under two paragraphs, "Immunosuppression" and 
"Malignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders", and 
section 4.8 of the SPC has been revised to focus on serious 
infections. 
A Patient Alert Card has been included in the Product

Clinical and radiographic results from a 2 year clinical study 
reflect 2 year data of a placebo-controlled clinical 
study in the treatment of psoriatic arthritis. Section 1 
of the PL has been updated accordingly.  
Furthermore, the MAH took the opportunity to 
complete the list of local representatives in the PL to 
include the two new EU Member States (Bulgaria and 
Romania) and to amend the name and contact 
in patients with active psoriatic arthritis were assessed. The 
study began with a 6-month double blind, placebo-
controlled period where patients were randomised to 
receive subcutaneous injections of 25 mg etanercept or 
placebo twice weekly.  Patients could then continue in a 
blinded maintenance period of up to 6 months, until all 
patients had completed the initial 6-month period. After the

maintenance period, all subjects received open-label 25 mg 
etanercept twice-weekly for 1 year. Radiographs of hands 
and wrists were obtained at baseline and months 6, 12, 
and 24. In an analysis in which all patients who dropped 
out of the study for any reason were considered to have 
progressed, the percentage of patients without progression 
at 12 months was higher in the Enbrel group compared 
with the placebo group (73% vs. 47%, respectively). The 
effect of Enbrel on radiographic progression was maintained 
in patients who continued on treatment during the second 
year. The slowing of peripheral joint damage was observed 
in patients with polyarticular symmetrical joint 
involvement. Enbrel treatment resulted in improvement in 
physical function during the double blind period, and this 
benefit was maintained during the longer term exposure of 
up to 2 years. 
Therefore section 4.1 "Therapeutic indications" of the SPC 
was updated to include that Enbrel has been shown to 
improve physical function in patients with psoriatic arthritis, 
and to reduce the rate of progression of peripheral joint 
damage as measured by X ray in patients with polyarticular 
symmetrical subtypes of the disease. Additionally, section 
5.1 "Pharmacodynamic properties" of the SPC was updated 
to include the radiographic results observed in this clinical 
study in patients with active psoriatic arthritis. 
As during the open-label period of the study 1 patient 
reported a serious infection (pneumonia), section 4.8

were exposed to significant amounts of Enbrel, and to 
greater amounts of breakdown products, after 
administration of Enbrel to maternal rats. 
The CHMP agreed with the MAH to include in section 4.6

As requested by the CHMP following the assessment

SmPC and PL 
In the reporting period of the PSUR n. 10 (from 20 July 
of PSUR n. 10 (covering the period from 20 July 
2004 to 2 February 2005), the MAH updated section 
4.8 of the SPC to include a new "rare" undesirable 
effect (Elevated liver enzymes) under a new body 
system (Hepatobiliary disorders).  
As requested by the CHMP following the outcome of 
an Ad Hoc Expert Group meeting on TNF-
antagonists, the MAH updated section 4.4 of the SPC 
2004 to 2 February 2005) the MAH received a total of 38 
reports covering 49 medically confirmed suspected adverse 
reactions relating to abnormal liver function tests. The 
reports were similar to those discussed in the cumulative 
review of hepatic disorders that the MAH has provided 
along with PSUR n. 10. 
The CHMP concluded that a large number of reports of 
hepatobiliary disorders have been presented in the PSUR 
Page 68/81 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to include a possible risk for the development of 
lymphomas or other malignancies in patients treated 
with a TNF-antagonist. 
Section 4. of the PL has been amended to reflect the 
new undesirable effect. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to improve the clarity of the instructions 
provided in the section "Instructions for preparing 
and giving an injection of Enbrel" in the PL. 
Additionally, following a request from the CHMP the 
wording of the indication 'polyarticular-course 
juvenile chronic arthritis' has been modified to reflect 
the currently valid definition 'polyarticular juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis'. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet 
n.10, some of which provided reasonable information on 
positive dechallenge and rechallenge. Therefore, the CHMP 
concluded that the MAH should provide a further review of 
hepatobiliary disorders in the next PSUR with a view to 
updating the Product Information with a statement 
regarding this issue. Therefore, the MAH has examined his 
database with a focus on case reports containing at least 
one event coded to MedDRA terms consistent with 
elevation of liver enzymes, without a reasonable alternative 
explanation for the event, and which showed evidence of a 
positive rechallenge or dechallenge. 
The MAH concluded on the basis of this analysis that there 
are reasonable grounds to suspect a causal association 
between etanercept administration and the occurrence of 
elevations of serum concentrations of hepatic enzymes.  
The MAH estimated the frequency of elevation of liver 
enzymes in association with etanercept to be less than 
1/1000 patients exposed, based on an analysis of the 
incidence of adverse events in placebo-controlled clinical 
trials in which methotrexate was not allowed to be 
administered. Therefore section 4.8 "Undesirable effects" of 
the SPC has been updated to include "Hepatobiliary 
disorders: Rare: Elevated liver enzymes" and section 4 
"Possible side effects" of the PL has been updated to 
include "Liver disorders: Rare: Elevated liver blood tests".

The recommended posology for Enbrel in psoriatic arthritis 
and 50 mg to include an alternative 50 mg once 
weekly dosing regimen for the treatment of 
ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis. 
Consequentially changes to sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 
of the SPC for Enbrel 25 mg and 50 mg have also 
been introduced to reflect the submitted supporting 
data. 
 Since this variation is for an alternative 50 mg 
dosage regimen for ankylosing spondylitis and 
psoriatic arthritis, these two indications have been 
added to Section 4.1 of the SPC for Enbrel 50 mg. 
The package leaflets have been amended to reflect

and ankylosing spondylitis is 25 mg Enbrel administered 
twice weekly. The objective of this type II variation is to 
amend the dose regimen for etanercept to include 50 mg 
once per week in the treatment of psoriatic arthritis and 
ankylosing spondylitis in adults in order to increase patient 
convenience and enhance compliance. 
The safety and efficacy of 50 mg Enbrel administered once 
weekly versus 25 mg Enbrel administered twice weekly 
were evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study 
of 356 patients with active ankylosing spondylitis. The 
primary objective of this study was to assess the efficacy 
and safety of etanercept 50 mg once weekly. The 
secondary objective was to evaluate the quality of life and 
pharmacokinetics of etanercept 50 mg once weekly. 
Subjects were randomly assigned to receive either 
subcutaneous injections of etanercept 50 mg once weekly, 
etanercept 25 mg twice weekly or placebo. 
The results from this study indicate that the safety and 
efficacy profiles of the 50 mg once weekly and 25 mg twice 
weekly regimens were similar. In addition the two 
etanercept dosing regimens produce equivalent AUC 
exposure as demonstrated by a population 
pharmacokinetics analysis which found  that in these 
ankylosing spondylitis patients, the etanercept steady state 
AUCs were 466 ug*hr/mL and 474 ug*h/mL for 50 mg

study  comparing Enbrel alone, methotrexate alone, and 
combination therapy with Enbrel and methotrexate have 
been assessed in adults with reumathoid arthritis. 
In this clinical  study, structural joint damage was assessed 
radiographically and expressed as change in Total Sharp 
Score (TSS) and its components, the erosion score and 
joint space narrowing score (JSN). Radiographs of 
hands/wrists and feet were read at baseline, 12, and 24 
months. The results of this 2-year study showed that the 
mean changes from the baseline in TSS were lower for 
patients  in combination therapy with Enbrel and 
methotrexate  and the etanercept group  compared with 
the methotrexate group  and this was confirmed over 24 
months. In an analysis in which all patients who dropped 
out of the study for any reason were considered to have 
progressed, the percentage of patients without progression 
(TSS change = 0.5) at 24 months was higher in the Enbrel 
in combination with methotrexate group compared with the 
Enbrel alone and methotrexate alone groups (62%, 50%, 
and 36%, respectively; p<0.05). The difference between 
Enbrel alone and methotrexate alone was also significant 
(p<0.05). Among patients who completed a full 24 months 
of therapy in the study, the non-progression rates were 
78%, 70%, and 61%, respectively. 
The mean changes from baseline in erosion scores for the

were significantly lower compared with the methotrexate 
group. At 24 months the combination-treated patients had 
significantly lower erosion change scores than patients 
treated with etanercept alone. The mean changes from 
baseline to 12 and 24 months in joint space narrowing were 
significantly lower for patients in the combination group  
compared with the methotrexate group . In conclusion

concerning a trial in which patients with Wegener's 
granulomatosis were treated with etanercept or placebo 
(the Wegener's granulomatosis etanercept trial - WGET).  
WGET was a placebo-controlled trial, in which 89 patients 
were treated with Enbrel in addition to standard therapy 
(including cyclophosphamide or methotrexate, and 
glucocorticoids) for a median duration of 25 months. The 
results of WGET  have not shown Enbrel to be an effective 
treatment for Wegener's granulomatosis.  The incidence of 
non-cutaneous malignancies of various types was 
Page 72/81

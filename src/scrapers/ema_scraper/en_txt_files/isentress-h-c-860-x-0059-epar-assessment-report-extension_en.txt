1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
Merck Sharp & Dohme Limited submitted on 27 May 2016 an extension of the marketing authorisation. 
The MAH applied for a change or addition of a new strength of 600mg film coated tablets. 
The MAH initially applied for the following indication for Isentress 600mg film coated tablets: 
ISENTRESS is indicated in combination with other anti-retroviral medicinal products for the treatment of 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV 1) infection in adults, adolescents, children, toddlers and infants from 
the age of 4 weeks (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2). 
Furthermore, the PI is brought in line with the latest QRD template version 10. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008 and Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008,  (2)

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
HIV is the virus that causes the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). HIV infects and leads to a 
depletion of immune cells (CD4 + cells). As the CD4-positive cells are depleted, the host becomes 
increasingly susceptible to a variety of opportunistic pathogens and immune deficiency related diseases. In 
the absence of treatment, most infected individuals succumb to HIV-related disease.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/294/877/2017 
Page 7/44 
  
  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Since the beginning of the epidemic, more than 70 million people have been infected with HIV, of which 
about 35 million people have died. The epidemic has reached every country and nearly all populations 
throughout the world. The overall prevalence of HIV appears to have stabilized, or increased in some 
countries, likely due to increased survival of infected people because of antiretroviral treatment. However, 
the 2015 incidence of new HIV infections represents a decline of 38 percent from 2001, when there were 3.4 
million new infections. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
HIV-1 infection results in chronic activation of the immune system and a subsequent gradual loss of CD4+ T 
cells eventually leading to a state of acquired immunodeficiency (AIDS). One of the predictors for HIV-1 
disease progression is the level of HIV-1 RNA in the blood (i.g. viral load). The aim of treatment of HIV-1 
infection is therefore to suppress the HIV-1 viral load to levels that are at least below 50 copies/mL of blood. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Initial infection may cause nonspecific febrile illness. The risk of subsequent manifestations is related to 
immunodeficiency and is proportional to the level of CD4+ cell counts. Manifestations range from 
asymptomatic carriage to AIDS, which is defined by serious opportunistic infections or cancers or a CD4 
count of < 200/μL. HIV infection can be diagnosed by antibody, nucleic acid (HIV RNA), or antigen (p24) 
testing. Screening should be routinely offered to all adults and adolescents. Treatment aims to suppress HIV 
replication by using combinations of 3 drugs that inhibit HIV enzymes; treatment can restore immune 
function in most patients if suppression of replication is sustained. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Over 25 individual agents are licensed to treat HIV-1 infection. These agents are members of 6 distinct 
mechanistic classes: nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse 
transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), protease inhibitors (PIs), fusion/entry inhibitors (EIs), integrase strand 
transfer inhibitors (InSTI; also commonly referred to as integrase inhibitors), and pharmacokinetic 
enhancers. Current guidelines for the management of treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected patients in various 
regions including the United States (US), United Kingdom (UK), and Europe (EACS) and elsewhere 
recommend 2 NRTIs and a third agent, generally of the InSTI or PI class. 
HIV infection requires life-long therapy, and patients must be highly adherent to avoid virologic failure and 
the development of resistance. HIV-infected patients often have concomitant medical conditions, 
necessitating the use of multiple medications for non-HIV related conditions. Thus, any measure to simplify 
HIV treatment increases the potential for improved adherence and overall therapeutic success. Raltegravir, 
with a well-established safety and efficacy profile, is currently administered twice daily. Once daily 
administration of raltegravir, as a regimen of two 600 mg tablets, will simplify therapy and thus has the 
potential to increase effectiveness by enhancing adherence. 
For HIV therapy, it is estimated that HIV patients must be at least 95% adherent to maintain long-term 
efficacy. A meta-analysis of 207 studies across multiple socioeconomic cohorts found that although 
adherence is strongly related to psychological factors and beliefs about the necessity of treatment, simpler 
Assessment report

Page 8/44 
  
  
treatment regimens were also significantly related to adherence. Among factors affecting the complexity of a 
dose regimen, pill count, dosing frequency, and adverse experiences are among the most significant in 
affecting adherence 
About the product 
Raltegravir was the first approved InSTI ART. Raltegravir inhibits the HIV integrase enzyme from inserting 
viral DNA into the host genome, an essential step in HIV replication. Raltegravir 400 mg BID has 
demonstrated characteristics which make it a useful option as first-line therapy for HIV-infected patients. 
These characteristics include potent antiviral activity, a favourable tolerability and safety profile, and few and 
manageable drug-drug interactions (DDIs). A once daily raltegravir dosing option would provide a more 
convenient treatment option for HIV-1 infected treatment-naïve patients and for continued treatment in 
patients who are virologically suppressed on an initial regimen of ISENTRESS® 400 mg BID, in adults and 
also in paediatric patients weighing at least 40 kg. It would facilitate adherence and improve the probability 
of achieving and maintaining optimal efficacy while retaining many of the favourable attributes of the 
ISENTRESS® 400 mg BID regimen. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
• 
Legal basis

Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/294/877/2017 
Page 9/44 
  
  
2.2.2.  Active  substance 
General information 
The active substance raltegravir potassium salt is identical to that used in the authorised products (Isentress 
400 mg tablet, 25 and 100 mg chewable tablets and 100 mg /sachet granules for an oral suspension). 
However to improve tensile strength of the formulation the active substance used in the 600 mg  film coated 
tablets is being jet milled which impacts the particle size distribution as well as the hygroscopicity. The milled 
active substance is slightly hygroscopic. The particle size of the milled raltegravir active substance has been 
characterised by laser diffraction technique. The particle size distribution of the milled raltegravir active 
substance is unimodal. 
Raltegravir was characterised by X-Ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD) and shown to be a crystalline material. In 
addition to anhydrous Form C, the potassium salt of raltegravir has two other known crystalline anhydrous 
polymorphs denoted as Form A and Form B.  The XRPD patterns for all crystalline forms are different and 
XRPD has been used to routinely differentiate the multiple crystalline forms. Solubility studies showed Form C 
to be the most thermodynamically stable phase under the commercial crystallisation process conditions.  
Additionally, from hygroscopicity experiments, Form C is not hygroscopic at 95% or lower relative humidities 
at 25°C, and no solid-state inter-conversion between anhydrous Form C and monohydrate has been observed 
under any relative humidity conditions at 25ºC. The potential for the milling operation to result in 
polymorphic form conversion of the active substance was evaluated using XRPD and Differential Scanning 
Calorimetry (DSC). The results for all tests are consistent with Anhydrous Form C, the desired form, 
indicating that polymorphic form conversion does not occur during the milling process.  
For information on the unmilled active substance reference is made to Module 3.2.S of the marketing 
authorisation of the authorised Isentress products. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is manufactured using third generation synthetic route as described in the approved 
registration of already authorised tablet. The active substance manufactured per the approved manufacturing 
process is then milled by passing the material through a jet-mill.  
The active substance is packaged in double LDPE liners closed separately with twist ties inside a HDPE drum. 
The inner liner may be heat sealed. The milled active substance is stored under nitrogen in this container 
closure system. The LDPE liners comply with Ph. Eur. 3.1.3 and European Directive EU 10/2011 including 
modifications with 2015/174 . 
Specification 
The milled active substance specification includes tests for: characteristics, identity (potassium test, IR), 
assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content (KF), particle size (laser diffraction). 
The specifications for the milled raltegravir active substance are identical to those listed in the currently 
approved tablets with the exception of the individual unspecified impurity and particle size distribution for 
which tighter limits are proposed for the active substance used in the new 600mg film coated tablet.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/294/877/2017 
Page 10/44 
  
  
The analytical procedures with the exception of particle size distribution are the same as in the currently 
approved tablets. The analytical method used for particle size distribution has been adequately described and 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. 
Batch analysis data on eight scale batches of the active substance are provided. The results are within the 
specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
A retest period of 36 months when stored below 30°C is approved for un-milled raltegravir active substance 
for the already approved tablets. 
Stability data were provided for nine scale batches of milled active substance, from the proposed 
manufacturers, stored in the intended commercial package for up to 36 months under long term conditions at 
25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the 
ICH guidelines. 
The following parameters were tested: characteristics, assay, impurities, water content, particle size. The 
analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating.  
No significant changes were observed. All tested parameters were within the specifications.  
The stability results indicate that the milled active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 36 months when stored below 
30ºC in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The quantitative composition of the yellow, oval-shaped 600 mg film-coated tablet is provided.  
The aim of this line extension is to introduce a 600 mg strength of raltegravir potassium salt film-coated 
tablets. The new strength was developed for once daily use (two 600 mg tablets taken one time daily) in 
order to reduce the pill burden and offer physicians and patients a more convenient raltegravir regime. The 
pharmaceutical development of the finished product contains QbD elements. Its objective was to develop a 
solid oral dosage form that meets safety and efficacy requirements of the Quality Target Product Profile 
(QTPP) throughout the shelf life of the product. Relevant aspects of the QTPP that influenced commercial 
product development are listed in Table 1.

The critical quality attributes (CQAs) identified were: appearance, degradation products, assay, dissolution, 
dose uniformity and water activity. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards, with the exception of the film-coating material Opadry II yellow which is tested according to an in-
house specification. In addition, the yellow iron oxide (E172) and black iron oxide (E172) used in Opadry II 
yellow  excipient are in compliance with current EU Directives concerning the use of colouring agents. There 
are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 
6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. The role, the choice of the excipients and their 
concentration has been satisfactorily justified. The additional controls on the degree of acid carboxymethyl 
substitution for croscarmellose sodium and particle size for the microcrystalline cellulose have been justified. 
The finished product is also for paediatric use, for paediatric patients weighing at least 40 kg. The tablets are 
yellow, oval-shaped, with the following dimensions 19.1 mm x 9.7 mm x 6.1 mm. The tablets are considered 
age appropriate.   
During pharmaceutical development three different formulations were developed: one for Phase 1, one for 
Phase 3 clinical trials and the formulation proposed for commercial use. The phase 1 and phase 3 tablets 
differed only in minor change to the non-functional film-coat composition (addition of colorant). The tablets 
used in phase 3 and the formulation proposed for commercial use had different OPADRY II non-functional 
film-coatings and were demonstrated to be similar in comparative dissolution studies. The Phase 1 and Phase 
3 tablet formulations had the same core tablet composition as the intended commercial product. 
A fluid bed granulation process was initially developed and utilised to establish the granulation composition. 
Fluid bed granulation was initially preferred over high shear wet granulation (HSWG) due to the perceived 
risk of raltegravir hydrolysis. After further evaluation and establishment of raltegravir stability in a wet 
system, high shear wet granulation was explored and developed as the commercial process for its 
favourability to produce denser granulation. 
Raltegravir 600 mg active product has been developed through a systematic risk-based development 
program to achieve a robust manufacturing process. The development of the intended commercial 
manufacturing process and the studies conducted across a variety of scales is described in detail. The 
objective was to develop a robust process to ensure the finished product consistently meets the critical 
quality attributes (CQA). 
A risk assessment of the major unit operations, high shear wet granulation, blending, lubrication, 
compression, and film coating was performed. The assessment identified areas of risks that needed to be 
addressed during development. Subsequent process development was focused on the risks that had the 
highest potential to impact the CQAs of the finished product.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/294/877/2017 
Page 12/44 
  
  
 
The use of prior knowledge from Isentress 400 mg tablets was limited because the raltegravir granules for 
this product are manufactured using high shear wet granulation vs. roller compaction for Isentress 400 mg 
tablets. 
Process parameter ranges were developed at small and pilot scale and studied again and verified at the 
intended commercial manufacturing site.  
A control strategy has been established at the commercial site to ensure that the process parameters remain 
within the defined process parameter ranges (Proven Acceptable Ranges (PARs)) for commercial production.  
Satisfactory information has been presented on the development of the dissolution test and the test 
conditions have been justified. While the proposed dissolution test has been demonstrated to be sensitive to 
manufacturing parameters for granulation level, compression force, and granulation wet- hold time, the 
Applicant has acknowledged that the limits as proposed fail to discriminate between batches with differences 
in these manufacturing variables as all batches will pass the dissolution criteria. The figures presented 
showed that that the dissolution profiles obtained for the batches with differences in granulation level, 
compression force, and wet-hold time are consistent with the range of dissolution performance obtained for 
batches used in clinical studies. 
However, batches expected to be outside of clinical experience (e.g., open dish storage at 40°C/75% RH) do 
fail the proposed dissolution criteria. Comparative data for the 400 mg and 600 mg formulations using the 
proposed commercial dissolution method for raltegravir 600 mg tablets have been presented and results 
showed that the profiles can be distinguished. The dissolution method is considered acceptable. 
The primary packaging is a HDPE bottle with a child-resistant polypropylene closure, induction seal and silica 
gel desiccant. The bottle materials comply with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The Applicant confirmed the 
child resistant container/closure complies with the International Standard (EN ISO 8317) Child-resistant 
packaging – Requirements and testing procedures for re- closable packages. The choice of the container 
closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  eight  main  steps:  granulation,  wet  milling,  drying,  milling,  blending 
and  lubrication,  compression,  film  coating,  packaging.  The  process  is  considered  to  be  a  standard 
manufacturing process.  
The description of the manufacturing process includes the Normal Operating Ranges (NOR) and target values 
for each of the process parameters in addition to the Proven Acceptable Ranges (PARs). Assurance has been 
provided, as requested, that only one parameter at a time will be varied from the target set points. 
The drying step and the compression step were identified as critical steps. The in-process controls are 
adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form.  
Adequate justification for holding times of intermediates (granulated material, bulk film coated tablet) has 
been provided. Justification has been provided to justify not defining the wet hold time as a Critical Process 
Parameter (CPP). The justification is considered acceptable.  
Process validation will be performed post authorisation and a suitable Process Validation Scheme has been 
provided.

Product specification  
The finished product specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: description, identity 
(HPLC, UV, NIR as an alternative method to UV method), assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), 
uniformity of dosage units –weight variation (Ph. Eur.), dissolution (HPLC), microbial limits (Ph. Eur.).  
The water activity level of the tablets is controlled by manufacturing process conditions, controlled relative 
humidity in the manufacturing and packaging areas, and the product package. These controls consistently 
resulted in batches with water activity ≤ 0.35. The water activity values then only decreased slightly through 
the 9 months formal stability studies as the desiccant in the bottle ensures water activity remains below 
critical levels throughout shelf life. As a result of the various controls, the water activity for the finished 
product was confirmed to be less than critical levels for microbial growth, dissolution slowdown, and 
raltegravir potassium salt disproportionation. Therefore, water activity was accepted not to be included as a 
release or shelf-life test. A finished product test for moisture was also accepted not to be included in the 
specification as moisture levels are controlled by the maintenance of low water activity levels. The moisture 
values have not changed significantly through the 9 month time point of the formal stability studies. 
A small and consistent disproportionation of raltegravir potassium to raltegravir free phenol is observed in the 
finished product. This occurs between the croscarmellose sodium (CCNa) and raltegravir salt dissolved in the 
granulating fluid in the high shear granulation process (maximum predicted free phenol is 2.9%). Additional 
disproportionation may occur in the tablet between raltegravir and the extragranular CCNa, but only at 
humidity levels (>45% RH) which allow sufficient water adsorption to facilitate the reaction. To control the 
formation of free phenol in this product, the degree of acid carboxymethyl substitution in croscarmellose 
sodium is limited and the water activity of the finished product is controlled during manufacturing, packaging 
and storage. Based on the controls implemented and stability results, a finished product test for raltegravir 
free phenol is not proposed.  
A finished product test for hardness is not proposed. Hardness within the proven acceptable range has not 
been shown to significantly impact the dissolution of the product. Also, no significant change in hardness has 
been observed in stability. The in-process hardness controls proposed are considered adequate to ensure 
quality of the product. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities 
testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for six pilot scale batches manufactured at the proposed commercial site 
using both registered active ingredient sources confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and 
its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. Additional batch analysis results are provided 
for batches from other manufacturing sites. 
Stability of the product 
Stability  data  were  provided  for  six  pilot  scale  batches  of  finished  product  manufactured  at  the  proposed 
commercial site using both active ingredient sources. The batches were stored under long term conditions for 
18 months at 25 ºC / 60% RH, under intermediate conditions for 18 months at 30 ºC / 75% RH and for six 
months  under  accelerated  conditions  at  40  ºC  /  75%  RH  according  to  the  ICH  guidelines.  The  batches  of 
medicinal  product  are  identical  to  those  proposed  for  marketing  and  were  packed  in  the  primary  packaging 
representative  of  those  proposed  for  marketing.  Samples  were  tested  for  appearance,  assay,  degradation

products  and  dissolution.  In  addition  to  the  specification  test  methods,  moisture  content,  water  activity, 
hardness,  free  phenol  content  and  microbial  quality  were  evaluated  during  the  formal  stability  studies. The 
analytical procedures used are stability indicating.  
No significant changes in appearance, assay, degradation products, dissolution, moisture, hardness and free 
phenol content were observed at any time point or storage condition. There was a decrease in water activity 
through  the  study.  However,  the  change  in  water  activity  had  no  impact  on  any  of  the  other  quality 
characteristics of the finished product. 
In addition, three batches were exposed to light in accordance with the ICH Guideline on Photostability 
Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. Results showed that the proposed 600mg tablet is stable 
when exposed to light. 
An in-use stability study was carried out by simulating a patient's in-use practice in the 60 count HDPE 
bottles at 30 ºC/75%RH for up to 8 weeks. Results support the proposed in-use stability shelf life as 
mentioned in the SmPC. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months with the following storage statement 
“Keep the bottle tightly closed, with the desiccant in order to protect from moisture.” as stated in the SmPC 
(section 6.3) are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as those 
used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the use of 
ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of 
Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal products. 
It is also confirmed that magnesium stearate is derived from purely vegetable origin. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the 
finished product manufacturing process. However, no design space was claimed. The results of tests carried 
out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to 
the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give 
reassurance on viral/TSE safety.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH did not provide any additional non-clinical data as no new non-clinical studies for raltegravir in 
support of this application were conducted. The raltegravir 1200 mg Once Daily (QD) development program 
and application are fully supported by non-clinical studies previously conducted in support of the raltegravir 
400 mg twice daily (BID) regimen (ISENTRESS).  
Raltegravir for once daily use (a 1200 mg dose consisting of two 600 mg tablets) allows for a simplified 
dosing regimen that will provide a convenient backbone for antiretroviral therapy regimens and will allow 
flexibility in the choice of other additional once daily agents that could improve patient compliance and 
satisfaction. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
No new non-clinical pharmacodynamic studies have been conducted to support the raltegravir 1200 mg QD 
development program. Findings from in vitro studies previously conducted in support of raltegravir 400 mg 
BID regimen pertain to raltegravir 1200 mg QD as they are independent of the formulation or frequency of its 
administration. These studies included: comprehensive evaluation of its in vitro biochemical and antiviral 
activities including its resistance profile, its activity against other enzymes and receptors, and its antiviral 
activity in combination with other antiretroviral agents. The safety pharmacology studies previously 
conducted in support of the raltegravir 400 mg BID application demonstrated that raltegravir evoked no 
significant ancillary pharmacological or behavioural effects when evaluated on a diverse range of 
physiological functions (cardiovascular, neurobehavior, respiratory) in vivo. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No new non-clinical pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted to support the raltegravir 1200 mg QD 
development program. The non-clinical pharmacokinetic studies previously conducted in support of 
raltegravir 400 mg BID regimen included: comprehensive evaluation of absorption, distribution, metabolism, 
and excretion (ADME) of raltegravir in rats and dogs (two species selected for the toxicological evaluation of 
the compound); the metabolism in CD-1 mice, the second species in which the carcinogenic potential of 
raltegravir was studied; evaluation of raltegravir as a substrate, inhibitor and inducer of major cytochrome 
P450 (CYP) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT) enzymes. For the purpose of interspecies comparisons 
between non-clinical animal models and humans, protein binding, metabolism, and excretion of raltegravir in 
humans were also discussed. In addition, the assessment of the inhibitory effect of raltegravir on major 
human drug uptake and efflux transporters was presented in the publication by the Applicant [Ref. 4.3: 
03Z7Q3]. The findings from the above studies conducted in support of raltegravir 400 mg BID regimen, 
including the in vitro assessment of raltegravir drug-drug interaction (DDI) potential, are applicable to 
raltegravir 1200 mg QD. 
Raltegravir is not a substrate of CYP enzymes and therefore, it is not expected to be a victim of DDIs via CYP 
inhibition or induction. Raltegravir is eliminated mainly by metabolism via a UGT1A1-mediated 
glucuronidation pathway and therefore, co-administration of potent UGT1A1 inhibitors or inducers may alter 
plasma levels of raltegravir. In vitro, raltegravir does not inhibit (IC50>100 μM) CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/294/877/2017 
Page 16/44 
  
  
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A, or induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4. In addition, raltegravir is not 
a potent inhibitor (IC50>50 μM) of the UGTs tested (UGT1A1, UGT2B7) or the major human drug efflux and 
uptake transporters in vitro. Raltegravir does not inhibit P˗glycoprotein and inhibits only 22% of breast cancer 
resistance protein (BCRP)-mediated transport at 100 μM. Raltegravir does not inhibit organic anion 
transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1, and it shows 40% inhibition of OATP1B3 and 16% inhibition of organic 
cation transporter (OCT)1 at 100 μM in vitro. In vitro, raltegravir also does not inhibit OCT2 and is not a 
potent inhibitor of organic anion transporter (OAT)1 and OAT3 (IC50 of 108 μM and 18.8 μM, respectively), 
and multidrug and toxin extrusion proteins (MATE)1 and MATE2˗K (52% and 29% inhibition at 100 μM, 
respectively). 
Based on in vitro data, raltegravir has overall, a low propensity to perpetrate clinically meaningful DDIs with 
substrates of major drug metabolizing enzymes or drug transporters at plasma concentrations following 1200 
mg QD administration (median Cmax of 16.8 μM; calculated unbound Cmax of 2.8 μM). The potential for 
raltegravir to inhibit the renal uptake transporter OAT3 at maximal concentrations following 1200 mg QD 
cannot be completely excluded based on in vitro data, however clinically meaningful DDI via this mechanism 
is unlikely. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
No new non-clinical toxicity studies have been conducted to support the raltegravir 1200 mg QD development 
program. The non-clinical toxicity studies previously conducted in support of raltegravir 400 mg BID regimen 
support clinical administration of raltegravir 1200 mg QD. All excipients in the raltegravir 1200 mg QD tablet 
are commonly used in pharmaceutical manufacturing, and no new impurities or degradation products were 
identified in the drug product. 
The previously conducted non-clinical toxicity evaluation demonstrated that raltegravir is generally well-
tolerated. Maximum oral and intravenous doses based on tolerability, formulation feasibility and/or plateau of 
exposure were used in toxicity studies to define the toxicity profile of raltegravir, with safety margins for the 
1200 mg raltegravir dose determined for each of the toxicities identified. Effects in rodents (mortality, body 
weight loss, and non-glandular stomach irritation) were attributed to the non-clinical raltegravir 
formulation’s well-characterized bulk dosing volume and local irritant effect following oral gavage of the 
non-clinical formulation and are not considered of significant risk to humans. There were no adverse effects 
in dogs up to the highest doses tested (plateau in systemic exposure). 
In developmental and reproductive toxicity studies, raltegravir has been shown not to pose a hazard to 
reproduction or to the developing foetus based on studies in rats and rabbits. In developmental toxicity 
studies in rats, a slight increase in the incidence of supernum erary ribs relative to control was found at the 
top dose of 600 mg/kg/day. There were no external or visceral abnormalities and no other fetal or postnatal 
developmental effects at this dose. The safety margin at the NOEL for developmental toxicity in rats is 
approximately 3.5-fold relative to the expected human AUC in patients administered therapeutic doses of 
raltegravir (either raltegravir 1200 mg QD or raltegravir 400 mg BID); in rabbits, no developmental toxicity 
was found at the maximum dose of 1000 mg/kg/day, resulting in a safety margin of about 3.7-fold relative to 
the expected maximal human AUC at the therapeutic dose. In a toxicokinetic study in pregnant and lactating 
rats, raltegravir was shown to cross the placental barrier with foetal exposure values up to 1.5- to 2.5-fold 
greater than in maternal plasma drug concentrations and was also present in rat milk at concentrations about 
3-fold compared to plasma. There were no effects on male or female fertility, on prenatal and postnatal 
development or on juvenile development in rats orally administered raltegravir.

Raltegravir was not genotoxic in a battery of in vitro assays in bacteria and mammalian cells designed to 
detect mutagenicity, direct DNA damage, or clastogenicity. Raltegravir was not shown to be a direct 
carcinogen when administered to rats and mice for 2 years. Localization of raltegravir to the 
nose/nasopharynx was determined to occur from routine techniques of oral gavage with periodic aspiration of 
dosing material into the nose and nasopharynx , resulting in secondary neoplastic findings attributed to 
chronic irritation and inflammation present within the nasopharynx and nose. The irritation potential of 
raltegravir was previously demonstrated in shorter duration rodent studies and in local tolerance studies. 
Based on the proposed mechanism, the observed neoplasia of the nose and nasopharynx of rats is considered 
to have minimal relevance to humans. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Using all default values for market penetration and no removal in the environment, the Predicted 
Environmental Concentration (PEC) based on maximum daily dose for currently marketed productsis 
determined to be 8 μg/L. The maximum daily dose of raltegravir associated with this application is 1200 
mg/day which corresponds to a PEC of 6 μg/L. Therefore, predicted environmental concentrations are 
anticipated to be equal to or lower than those already approved. No significant increase in the environment is 
expected to occur as a result of this application. 
2.3.6.  Conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical studies have been performed in support of this application. The data provided are 
considered to be sufficient to support the proposed use of raltegravir once daily.  
2.4.  Clinical aspects

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Raltegravir 1200mg (QD) given once a day as 2X600mg tablets is absorbed with a median T max of 
approximately 1.5 to 2 hours in the fasted state.  
Bioavailability 
When compared to both raltegravir 400 mg BID (2 x 400 mg tablets) and raltegravir 1200 mg QD (3 x 400 
mg tablets), raltegravir 1200 mg QD (2 x 600 mg tablets) has a higher systemic exposure.  
In Study P291, an open-label, multiple-dose, randomized, three-period, three-treatment, six-sequence, 
crossover, comparative bioavailability study designed to assess the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir after a 
multiple dose administration for five days of reformulated Raltegravir 600 mg Tablets (1200 mg QD) 
(Treatment A) and Isentress® 400 mg Tablets (1200 mg QD (Treatment B) and 400 mg q12 (Treatment C)) 
in which the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters AUC24, Cmax, Ctrough (C24) and T max for Treatments A and B 
and AUC12, Cmax, Ctrough (C12), Tmax and AUC24 (AUC12 x 2) for Treatment C were estimated using a non-
compartmental approach.  
Administration of the 1200 mg dose given as 2 x 600 mg tablets once daily resulted in a GM (CV%) Ctrough of 
81.1nM (72%), AUC0-24 of 59.5μM-hr (34%) and Cmax of 20.6μM (44%) on Day 5 
Administration of the 1200 mg dose given as 3 x 400 mg tablets once daily resulted in a GM (CV%) Ctrough of 
83.5nM (53%), AUC0-24hr of 49.0 μM-hr (73%), and Cmax of 14.1μM (99%) on Day 5 
Administration of the 400 mg dose given twice daily resulted in a GM (CV%) Ctrough of 130.9 nM (56%), 
AUC0-24 (2 x AUC0-12) of 25.4 μM-hr (106%), and Cmax of 3.4 μM (153%) on Day 5

Influence of food 
Study P290 was conducted to the effect of a low-fat and a high-fat breakfast on the pharmacokinetics (Cmax, 
AUCinf and C24) of raltegravir 1200 mg dose (2x600mg) and Isentress® 400 mg Tablets (3 x 400 mg). 
Administration of a 1200 mg dose as 2 x 600 mg tablets in the fasted state resulted in a geometric mean 
(GM) C24hr of 57.7 nM, Cmax of 22.6 μM, and AUC0-last of 56.5 μM-hr. Administration of a low-fat meal 
resulted in a 42% decrease in AUC0-last, 52% decrease in Cmax, and 16% decrease in C24hr. Administration 
of a high-fat meal resulted in a 1.9% increase in AUC0-last, 28% decrease in Cmax, and 12% decrease in 
C24hr. 
Administration of a 1200 mg dose as 3 x 400 mg tablets in the fasted state resulted in a GM C24hr of 46.7 
nM, Cmax of 9.2 μM and AUC0-last of 33.8 μM-hr. Administration of a low-fat meal resulted in a 73% 
decrease in AUC0-last, 75% decrease in Cmax, and 18% decrease in C24hr. Administration of a high-fat 
meal resulted in a 39% increase in AUC0-last, 23% decrease in Cmax, and 70% increase in C24hr. 
Distribution 
Raltegravir is moderately bound (83%) to proteins in human plasma in vitro. Raltegravir does not 
significantly partition into human blood cells in vitro, with a blood-to-plasma concentration ratio of 0.6. In 
vitro studies show that raltegravir is a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate. 
Elimination 
The major elimination pathway of raltegravir is via UGT 1A1-mediated glucuronidation. Similar to the 
raltegravir 400 mg BID formulation, the apparent terminal elimination half-life of the 600 mg tablet 
formulation is approximately 9 to 12 hours with a shorter α-phase half-life (~1 hour) accounting for much of 
the AUC. 
Special populations 
Impaired renal function 
No renal impairment study was performed with the proposed raltegravir 1200 mg QD (as 2 x 600 mg 
tablets). Based on the renal impairment results described in previous raltegravir submissions, no specific 
clinical recommendation is needed for raltegravir 1200 mg QD (2 x 600 mg) dosing. 
Impaired hepatic function 
No hepatic impairment study was performed with the proposed raltegravir 1200 mg QD (as 2 x 600 mg 
tablets).  Based on the hepatic impairment results described in previous raltegravir submissions, no specific 
clinical recommendation is needed for raltegravir 1200 mg QD (2 x 600 mg) dosing.

Children  
Population PK modelling was conducted to define a weight cut-off that will support the use of 1200 mg QD (2 
x 600 mg) in paediatric patients to find a weight range such that raltegravir exposures were contained within 
the exposure range determined to be safe in adults from PN292. The Pop PK model was based on data from 
the five Phase 1 studies (PN290, PN291, PN812, PN823, and PN824) and  the Phase 3 study (PN292) in 
adults. 
A fixed allometric scaling approach was used to simulate steady state exposures in HIV-infected paediatric 
patients following administration of raltegravir 1200 mg QD.  
Results of the paediatric simulations showed that among the various subgroups evaluated, weight cut-offs 
range between 30 to 45 kg when comparing AUC0-24hr,ss in adult and paediatric patients. The highest cut-
offs are identified in Black/other paediatric patients receiving TRUVADA both under fasted or high fat meal 
conditions; in these two groups the immediately lower weight group (≥ 40 and <45 kg) shows exposures that 
are just above the safety threshold but the difference appears to be negligible. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Based on in vitro data, raltegravir is not a substrate of CYP enzymes and therefore, it is not expected to be a 
victim of DDIs via CYP inhibition or induction. Based on in vivo and in vitro studies, raltegravir is eliminated 
mainly by metabolism via a UGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation pathway and co-administration of UGT1A1 
inhibitors or inducers may alter plasma levels of raltegravir.  
The applicant considers that the DDI studies conducted for Isentress can be extended to raltegravir 1200 mg 
QD but notes that that the criteria for a clinically important change in raltegravir PK are different for 1200 mg 
QD in comparison to 400 mg BID.  
The applicant considers that no clinically relevant difference in the efficacy of raltegravir 1200 mg QD is 
anticipated for factors that decrease raltegravir Ctrough by <25%; specifically, the lower bound of the 90% 
confidence interval (CI) of Ctrough geometric mean ratio (GMR) must be >0.75.  Additionally, no clinically 
relevant difference in the safety of raltegravir 1200 mg QD is anticipated for factors that increase raltegravir 
AUC0-24 by <100%; specifically, the upper bound of the 90% CI of AUC0-24 GMR must be <2.00. 
In an open-label randomized, 2-period, fixed-sequence study to evaluate the effect of co-administration of 
efavirenz and (MK-0518) raltegravir on the plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of raltegravir (study PN812), 
Raltegravir was rapidly absorbed with an observed median Tmax of 1.5 hours following both treatments. The 
geometric mean apparent terminal t½ values were similar following raltegravir alone and raltegravir + 
efavirenz (8.95 hours and 8.87 hours, respectively). Co-administration with efavirenz yielded GMRs 
(raltegravir + efavirenz/ raltegravir alone) (90% CIs) for raltegravir AUC0-∞, Cmax, and C24 of 0.86 (0.73, 
1.01), 0.91 (0.70, 1.17), and 0.94 (0.76, 1.17), respectively. 
In another open-label 2-period, fixed-sequence study under fed conditions to evaluate the effect of co-
administration of atazanavir and raltegravir on the plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of raltegravir (PN 
823), Co-administration with atazanavir yielded GMRs (90% CIs) for raltegravir AUC0-∞, Cmax, and C24 of 
1.67 (1.34, 2.10), 1.16 (1.01, 1.33), and 1.26 (1.08, 1.46), respectively. Since the upper 90% CI of the 
raltegravir AUC0-∞ GMR obtained in the presence of atazanavir exceeded the upper clinical bound (2.00), 
therefore co-administration of atazanavir with raltegravir QD is not recommended.

In study PN824 A non-randomized, single-site, open-label, 4-period, fixed sequence trial of 1200 mg 
raltegravir, alone or in combination with metal cation-containing antacids (TUMS® Ultra Strength (US, 
calcium carbonate) or MAALOX Maximum Strength (MS, magnesium/aluminum hydroxide) (or generic 
equivalent) in HIV-infected male and female subjects 18 years of age or older; Steady state Cmax, AUC0-24 
and C24 of raltegravir decreased by approximately 74%, 72% and 48%, respectively when 1200 mg QD 
raltegravir is given concomitantly with 3 tablets of TUMS® Ultra Strength 1000. Median Tmax remained 
unchanged after Three (3) tablets of TUMS Ultra Strength 1000 and 1200 mg QD raltegravir given 
concomitantly relative to 1200 mg QD raltegravir alone. 
Steady state Cmax, AUC0-24 and C24 of raltegravir decreased by approximately 14%, 14% and 58%, 
respectively, when 20 mL MAALOX MS (or generic equivalent) is given 12 hours after administration of 1200 
mg QD raltegravir. Median Tmax remained unchanged after Twenty (20) mL MAALOX® MS (or generic 
equivalent) given 12 hours after administration of 1200 mg QD raltegravir relative to 1200 mg QD raltegravir 
alone. 
Steady state Cmax, AUC0-24 and C24 of raltegravir decreased by approximately 2%, 10% and 57%, 
respectively, when 3 tablets of TUMS® Ultra Strength 1000 is given 12 hours after administration of 1200 
mg QD raltegravir. Median Tmax remained unchanged Three (3) tablets of TUMS® Ultra Strength 1000 given 
12 hours after administration of 1200 mg QD MK-0518 relative to 1200 mg QD raltegravir alone. 
Exposure relevant for safety evaluation 
Exploratory safety analyses based on raltegravir exposure quartiles were conducted using steady state AUC0-
24 and Cmax for each subject in PN292 that were determined using the population PK model described in 
section 2.1.9.  
There was no significant difference was observed in the reports of clinical and laboratory adverse events in 
study PN292 for subjects in the highest quartile of raltegravir exposure (69 μM*hr to 365 μM *hr for AUC0-
24 and 20.5 μM to 48 μM for Cmax) when compared to subjects in the lower quartiles (16.5 to 69 μM*hr for 
AUC0-24 and 1.8 to 20.5 μM for Cmax).  There was no trend observed related to increasing raltegravir 
exposure across the quartiles. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
In previous applications, Ctrough (i.e. C24hr for raltegravir has been noted to be the appropriate PK 
parameter for determining efficacy i.e. in study PN071, A Ctrough of 45 nM was considered to be the cut-off 
below which a greater risk of treatment failure was observed which corresponded closely to the 25th 
percentile of the distribution of Ctrough values (43.28 nM) for raltegravir 800 mg QD. For raltegravir 1200 
mg QD, the 25th percentile value was 62.74 nM and therefore above the cut-off for which there is a higher 
risk of treatment failure. 
Exposure-efficacy analysis was conducted to assess the relationship between PK and efficacy endpoints of 
raltegravir 1200 mg QD (2 x 600 mg) and ISENTRESS 400 mg BID using information from study PN292 in 
order to confirm its consistency with ISENTRESS® 400 mg BID PK/PD relationship. PK and week 48 efficacy 
data from the study were used which included 797 treatment naïve HIV patients; raltegravir 1200 mg QD 
(N=531) and ISENTRESS® 400 mg BID (N=266). PK endpoints were determined using observed sparse 
concentrations from both treatment groups. The following were included in the analyses;

• 
the geometric mean of all observed concentrations for individuals subjects (Call_obs)  
the geometric mean of the observed concentration between 22 and 26 hours post-dose for 1200 mg 
QD (C24_obs) 
the geometric mean of the observed concentration between 11 and 13 hours post-dose for 400 mg 
BID (C12_obs) 
The population PK model developed for raltegravir 1200 mg QD was used to predict the steady-state Ctrough 
values at 24 hour post-dose (C24) in subjects from the QD treatment arm.  
Efficacy endpoints included the primary and secondary endpoints from PN292 i.e. achieving HIV-1 RNA <40 
copies/mL and change from baseline in CD4 cell count, respectively.  
Logistic regression was conducted to examine the relationship between PK and HIV RNA <40 copies/mL, with 
screening viral load (≤ 100,000 or >100,000 copies/mL), baseline CD4 cell count, and hepatitis B and/or C 
co-infection included for covariate evaluation. Additionally, the percent of patients achieving the viral 
suppression target (HIV-1 RNA <40 copies/mL) was also evaluated by quartiles of the PK endpoints. For the 
change from baseline in CD4 cell count, Pearson’s correlation and Spearman’s rank correlation with PK were 
calculated. 
The odds ratios of PK and log-transformed PK parameters showed no statistical evidence of an association 
between any of the raltegravir exposure endpoints and probability of achieving HIV-1 RNA <40 copies/mL. 
In terms of the percent of patients achieving HIV-1 RNA <40 copies/mL there no suggestion of a trend or 
apparent relationship between viral suppression and the range of raltegravir exposures achieved from both 
treatment regimens in PN292. It would appear that a similar degree of viral suppression is achieved across all 
quartiles of the Ctrough values from raltegravir 1200 mg QD, including the lowest quartile (< 25th percentile) 
when compared with ISENTRESS 400 mg BID. 
For the analysis of change from baseline in CD4 cell count (secondary Phase 3 efficacy endpoint), no 
significant correlation was found for the majority of the PK endpoints from both raltegravir treatment 
regimens in PN292. In patients with screening HIV-1 RNA ≤ 100,000 copies/mL and hepatitis B and/or C co-
infection, a trend (p-value <0.05) was observed between change from baseline in CD4 cell count and 
Call_obs (Spearman’s rank correlation = 0.645 and 0.497) for both raltegravir treatment regimens, and 
combined Ctrough values (Spearman’s rank correlation = 0.692) from both treatment regimens. However, 
due to the small sample size in these subgroups (N=11-13). The applicant considers that no clinically 
meaningful correlations were found between raltegravir PK endpoints and change from baseline in CD4 cell 
counts. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
In order to characterise the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir 1200 mg QD, the applicant relies on BA/BE 
studies (PN290 and PN291) conducted to compare the PK of this new proposed posology with that of 
Isentress 400mg b.i.d. This approach is considered acceptable. The results of the studies suggest that 
raltegravir 1200 mg QD (2 x 600 mg tablets) has a higher systemic exposure and Cmax when compared to 
raltegravir 400mg b.i.d. however, the Ctrough for raltegravir 1200 mg QD is lower than the 400mg b.i.d. 
regimen but the mean Ctrough observed in study 291 is higher than the threshold of 45 nM associated with 
reduced efficacy in previous studies.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/294/877/2017 
Page 23/44 
  
  
PKPD modelling focusses on the overall exposure (AUC), however the importance of Ctrough is recognised, 
particularly in terms of defining a weight cut off for dosing children. 
The effect of other drugs on the elimination of raltegravir is well characterised and strong inducers and 
inhibitors of UGT1A1 are not recommended.  However further in vitro work, and a better discussion, is 
required to fully understand the potential for raltegravir to interact on other drugs. 
For the enzymes: 2B6, 2D6 and UGT2B7 and transporters: OATP1B3, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, MATE-1 and 
MATE-2k, further in vitro data at higher substrate concentrations to determine a Ki is required to rule out the 
possibility of DDIs. Alternatively a mechanistic static model may be used to provide further support for a lack 
of interactions. Dependent on the results of these investigations, the maraviroc and tenofovir interactions 
should be reconsidered in mechanistic terms. The MAH committed to submit the results once completed. 
PK/PD viral dynamics modelling  
A PK/PD viral dynamics model was developed linking drug concentrations to viral inhibition thereby to 
treatment outcome in order to characterize the exposure-response relationship for raltegravir efficacy and 
the implications of changes to the PK profile.  The PK/PD viral dynamics model incorporates information 
about the entire concentration time profile of raltegravir. Using an Emax model incorporating an in vivo EC50, 
the raltegravir concentration versus time profile is converted to a profile of percent viral inhibition versus 
time with a calculated average inhibition over the dosing interval. From this average inhibition, again using 
the Emax model, a concentration can be calculated which would result in this same level of average inhibition 
over the dosing interval as if the concentration were held constant over the interval. This concentration is the 
Equivalent Constant Concentration, or ECC, and is the PK parameter which is used as the input in the viral 
dynamics model. 
The in vivo EC50 values (raltegravir concentration resulting in 50% inhibition) for infectivity and cell 
activation were 3.5 ng/ml and 30 ng/ml, respectively, with simulation results being primarily driven by 
changes to the EC50 value associated with inhibition of infectivity. Raltegravir pharmacokinetic data from the 
Phase 1 study PN291 were used to assess the probability that the raltegravir pharmacokinetic profiles 
associated with 1200 mg QD raltegravir would result in efficacy similar to that obtained in adults with the 
recommended dose of 400 mg BID ISENTRESS. The full PK profiles obtained in PN291 were used to calculate 
a distribution of steady state ECC values for each treatment 
The PK profiles for both formulations of raltegravir at a dose of 1200 mg QD are projected to result in 
virologic efficacy similar to that observed in adults taking the 400 mg BID dose. The PK/PD viral dynamics 
model suggested that 1200 mg QD reformulated raltegravir has a high probability of demonstrating non-
inferiority to 400 mg BID 
The PKPD modelling appears to show that responses are at the top of the concentration response curve and 
therefore changes in exposure do not have a big impact on efficacy. 
The viral dynamic model allows a more mechanistic understanding of the PKPD and change in profile shape 
versus efficacy and thus is considered to be useful.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
There are no significant concerns regarding the PK and PD of raltegravir 1200 mg QD.

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Main study 
The efficacy of this new dose strength and dosing schedule was evaluated in a single study (292 - ONCEMRK) 
Study Title: A Phase III Multicenter, Double-Blind, Randomized, Active Comparator-Controlled Clinical Trial 
to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Reformulated Raltegravir 1200 mg Once Daily Versus Raltegravir 400 
mg Twice Daily, Each in Combination With TRUVADA, in Treatment- Naïve HIV-1 Infected Subjects 
Methods 
A Phase 3, multicentre, double-blind, randomised, active comparator controlled clinical study to evaluated the 
safety and efficacy of raltegravir 1200 mg QD (2 x 600 mg tablets) versus raltegravir 400 mg BID, each in 
combination with TRUVADA, was conducted in treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected subjects. 
Study Participants 
HIV-infected (RNA ≥ 1000 copies/mL) subjects who had never received antiretroviral therapy were included 
in the study. Subjects with documented HIV resistance to raltegravir or the NRTI backbone (tenofovir and 
emtricitabine) were excluded. 
Endpoints 
The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects achieving HIV-1 RNA (Ribonucleic acid) < 40 copies/mL 
at Week 48. 
Secondary endpoints  
•  CD4 cell counts 
CD4 cell counts were determined at Screening, Randomisation (Day 1), Weeks 24, 48, 72, and 96, virologic 
failure confirmation, early discontinuation, and at the 14-day post-therapy follow-up. CD4 cell count 
determinations were performed by the central laboratory according to its standard procedures.

Sample size 
The sample size calculation was based on the following assumptions: an overall one-sided 2.5% significance 
level, 90% power, a true response rate of 85% at Week 48 for raltegravir 400 mg b.i.d. arm and no larger 
than 1% lower response rate for the for reformulated raltegravir 1200 mg q.d. arm using the NC=F approach 
as defined by the FDA “snapshot” approach, and a non-inferiority margin of 10%. The study was also 
powered  to declare, with 95% confidence, that the true difference between treatment groups is no more 
than 10.0 percentage points for a reasonably common adverse experience which occurs in 20% of subjects 
receiving either reformulated raltegravir 1200 mg q.d. or raltegravir 400 mg b.i.d., each in combination 
therapy with TRUVADA. 
A total of 802 subjects were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to received Reformulated Raltegravir 1200 mg once 
daily (q.d.) + TRUVADA q.d  (Group 1, n=533) or  Raltegravir 400 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) + TRUVADA™ q.d 
(Group 2, n=269). 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) population consisted of all randomised subjects who: 
• 
• 
received at least one dose of study treatment, and 
had baseline data for those analyses that require baseline data. 
The per-protocol population was initially not defined. Therefore the applicant was requested to provide a PP 
definition retrospectively which is as follows:  
The PP population excludes subjects due to important deviations from the protocol that may substantially 
affect or confound the results of the primary efficacy endpoint(s). Since these criteria were not pre-identified, 
the Applicant developed these criteria based on information about PP analyses gathered from ICH regulatory 
guidance [Ref. 5.4: 03RCZH], recent publications for HIV integrase inhibitors (dolutegravir, elvitegravir) [Ref. 
5.4: 03TFV3] [Ref. 5.4: 03WQHQ] [Ref. 5.4: 04MGY8] [Ref. 5.4: 042KWT] [Ref. 5.4: 04MGYH] [Ref. 5.4: 
04F2P3] and the company’s anti-infective studies. Three high-level categories of exclusion were selected as 
described below: 1) Discontinuation for reasons not related to treatment; 2) Non-compliance with study 
medication; and 3) Identified major protocol deviations that have the potential to impact efficacy. 
One interim analysis was performed for the sole purpose of stopping the study in the event of a lack of 
efficacy (futility) on 30 June 2015. The interim analysis was performed when approximately 375 subjects 
randomised in the study either completed the Week 24 visit or discontinued before Week 24. 
Primary analysis: 
The difference in proportions of subjects achieving HIV-1 RNA < 40 copies / mL between treatment groups 
and the associated 95% confidence interval was calculated using stratum-adjusted Mantel- Haenszel method 
with the difference weighted by the harmonic mean of sample size per arm for each stratum (screening HIV-
1 RNA ≤100,000 copies/mL or HIV-1 RNA >100,000 copies/mL). All missing data were treated as failures 
regardless of the reason. Reformulated raltegravir 1200 mg q.d. was concluded non-inferior to raltegravir 
400 mg b.i.d., each in combination therapy with TRUVADA, if the lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI for 
Assessment report

the difference in proportion of subjects with HIV-1 RNA<40 copies/mL at Week 48 (reformulated raltegravir 
1200 mg q.d. minus raltegravir 400 mg b.i.d.) was greater than -10 percentage points. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
The proportion of subjects achieving HIV RNA <40 copies/mL at Week 48 by the FDA Snapshot approach was 
88.9% and 88.3% for the raltegravir 1200 mg QD and 400 mg BID groups, respectively. The treatment 
difference between the raltegravir 1200 mg QD group and 400 mg BID  was 0.510%, 95% CI: (-4.204, 
5.223). Therefore raltegravir 1200 mg QD group was demonstrated to be non-inferior to raltegravir 400 mg 
BID. 
For the PP population, using the FDA snapshot approach (NC=F) for missing data, similarly high proportions 
of subjects achieved HIV-1 RNA <40 copies/mL at Week 48 in the QD and BID treatment groups: 93.2%

(455/488) versus 91.3% (232/254), respectively, with a treatment difference [95% CI] of 1.891% [-2.249, 
6.032]. This demonstrates the non-inferiority of QD versus BID given the lower bound of the 95% CI is 
greater than -10%. 
CD4 cell counts 
At Week 48, the mean change from baseline in CD4 cells (cells/mm3)(95% CI) was 232.0 (214.6, 249.4) and 
234.1 (212.8, 255.3) in the QD and BID groups, respectively.

Raltegravir 1,200 mg QD and raltegravir 400 mg BID were administered with emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. 
Protocol Defined Virologic Failure and Virologic Resistance (PDVF) 
At Week 48, 36/531 (6.8%) subjects in the raltegravir QD group and 18/266 (6.8%) subjects in the 
raltegravir BID group were identified as PDVFs. In both treatment groups it would appear that half of the 
PDVFs were non-responders and the other half were rebounders.  
It should be noted that in the raltegravir QD group, 27 of the 36 subjects (75.0%) who met PDVF criteria 
later suppressed below 40 copies/mL. 55.6% of these 36 subjects were considered successes at the Week 48

primary analysis. In the BID group, similarly, 13 of the 18 subjects (72.2%) later suppressed (44.4%) were 
considered successes at the Week 48 primary analysis. 
Specimens from 14 subjects in the QD group and 3 subjects in the BID group with protocol-defined virologic 
failure were subjected to resistance testing. 
The overall rate of resistance to any agent among subjects in the raltegravir QD group was 0.9% i.e. (5/531 
of the subjects). All 5 had resistance to raltegravir and/or emtricitabine (FTC): 4 of the 5 had resistance to 
both raltegravir and FTC, and 1 had resistance to FTC only. The 4 subjects with raltegravir and FTC resistance 
had integrase mutations in N155H/I203M, V151I/N155H, N155H, L74M/E92Q as well as RT mutations in 
M184, either M184V or M184M/I/V. The subject with the L74M/E92Q mutation discontinued the study for lack 
of efficacy; this subject’s HIV RNA levels were suppressed to <40 copies/mL at the 14-day follow-up visit. 
The subject with FTC resistance only had M184V and V118I mutations; this subject remained on study 
treatment and HIV RNA was re-suppressed to <40 copies/mL at Weeks 36 and 48.  
No TDF mutations were observed. Among the 3 subjects in the BID group with virologic failure who had 
resistance testing performed, no raltegravir mutations were found. In all subjects with resistance mutations, 
compliance was at least 94%. 
Overall it is considered that the resistance rate and pattern were similar to those described previously in the 
Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies of raltegravir BID conducted in treatment-naïve and treatment experienced 
subjects

Primary Analysis 
HIV-1 RNA 
Statistical methodology: The primary hypothesis on antiretroviral activity was 
assessed by the percentage of subjects achieving plasma HIV RNA <40 copies/mL at 
Week 48. Raltegravir QD was concluded to be non-inferior to raltegravir BID if the 
lower bound of the two-sided exact 95% CI for the difference in response rate 
(raltegravir QD – raltegravir BID) remained above -10 percentage points. The NC=F 
approach as defined by FDA “snapshot” approach was used as the primary approach 
to analysis with respect to the proportion of subjects with virologic response (HIV-1 
RNA <40 copies/mL). All missing data were treated as failures regardless of the 
reason.

Statistical methodology: The treatment difference of changes in CD4 cell counts at 
time points of interest was estimated between the two treatment groups. However, 
these estimates were not subject to an absolute criterion for similarity. The clinical 
interpretation of the treatment difference is dependent upon the absolute value at 
baseline, magnitude and direction of the CD4 changes seen in each treatment arm. 
The OF approach was used for the calculations of change from baseline in CD4 cell 
count. Under this approach, baseline values were carried forward for subjects who 
discontinued due to lack of efficacy.

2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
This application concerns the use of two tablets of raltegravir 600mg film-coated tablet formulation taken 
once a day (1200mg QD) in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. 
The intention is to simplify dosing of raltegravir by providing once daily dosing.  
One phase III clinical study which evaluated the safety and efficacy of raltegravir 1200 mg QD (2 x 600 mg 
tablets) in comparison to raltegravir 400 mg BID, each in combination with TRUVADA™, in treatment-naïve 
HIV-1 infected subjects was provided in support of this application. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
In general, the design of the study including the patient selection criteria, statistical method, the endpoints 
and choice of comparator is acceptable. For the primary outcome, the cut-off of <40copies/ml at 48 weeks 
was used due to the sensitivity of the Abbott Real Time HIV-1 assay. This was considered acceptable. 
Raltegravir 400mg b.i.d is approved for use in treatment-naïve and treatment experienced patients and 
therefore acceptable as a comparator.  
In the statistical analysis, the NC=F approach as defined by FDA “snapshot” approach was used as the 
primary approach to analysis was the proportion of subjects with virologic response. The sensitivity analysis 
was performed using the Observed Failure (OF) approach. Both approaches were considered acceptable.  
The primary outcome was based only on the FAS. However since this is a non-inferiority study, the outcome 
should have been based on both the FAS and PP populations. Therefore the PP was retrospectively defined. 
There were a number of protocol deviations including GCP non-compliance for which a GCP inspection was 
triggered. The results of the triggered inspection d showed no critical findings. However there were a number 
of major and minor findings with respect to eDiary completion and the reliability of the data to assess 
compliance as per the protocol definition. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The proportion of subjects achieving HIV RNA <40 copies/mL at Week 48 by the FDA Snapshot approach was 
88.9% and 88.3% for the raltegravir 1200 mg QD and 400 mg BID groups, respectively.  The treatment 
different was 0.5 95% CI (-4.2 to 5.2). Therefore Raltegravir 1200mg QD was demonstrated to be non-
inferior to Raltegravir b.i.d for the FAS  
For the PP population, using the FDA snapshot approach (NC=F) for missing data, similarly high proportions 
of subjects achieved HIV-1 RNA <40 copies/mL at Week 48 in the QD and BID treatment groups: 93.2% 
(455/488) versus 91.3% (232/254), respectively, with a treatment difference [95% CI] of 1.891% [-2.249, 
6.032]. This demonstrates the non-inferiority of QD versus BID given the lower bound of the 95% CI is 
greater than -10%. 
In terms of secondary endpoints in particular CD4 counts,  time to virologic response (TVR), time to loss of 
virologic response (TLOVR), The proportion of subjects achieving HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL and the 
proportion of subjects achieving HIV-1 RNA <200 copies/mL, the results for Raltegravir 1200mg QD were 
demonstrated to be comparable to Raltegravir  400mg b.i.d.

2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Raltegravir 1200mg QD  has been demonstrated to be non-inferior to Raltegravir bid in achieving HIV-1 RNA 
< 40 copies/mL at week 48 using the NC=F approach as defined by FDA “snapshot” approach and the 
Observed Failure (OF) approach for the FAS and PP population. The benefit risk for the proposed new 
posology is considered to be positive. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
One hundred and thirty-three (133) subjects (39 female; 94 male) received at least one dose of raltegravir 
1200 mg or 1800 mg QD in six Phase 1 studies (PN290, PN291, PN293, PN812, PN823 and PN824). 
In the phase III study PN 292, 531 subjects received raltegravir 1200 mg QD and 266 subjects received 
raltegravir 400 mg BID for 48 weeks. 
Adverse events 
In the phase I studies, the most commonly reported adverse events (those occurring at an incidence ≥ 5%) 
for raltegravir alone were: headache (15%), hypertension (6.8%), myalgia (6%), and abdominal pain 
(5.3%), and for raltegravir + other were: diarrhoea (6%) and upper respiratory tract infection (6%). 
In study PN 292, the proportions of subjects with AEs and with drug-related AEs in the QD group were similar 
to those in the BID group. The frequency of individual clinical AE preferred terms was similar in both 
treatment groups. 
The most frequently reported clinical AEs (reported in ≥ 10% of subjects in one or more treatment groups), 
were: headache (13.4%, 10.9%), nausea (11.3%, 9.8%) and diarrhoea (10.9%, 11.3%). The most 
frequently reported (incidence >2%) drug-related AEs in either group (shown as % for QD, % for BID) were 
nausea (7.3%, 6.8%), headache (3.0%, 4.5%), and dizziness (2.3%, 3.0%) 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
There were 3 fatal AEs in the study: tuberculosis and immunoblastic lymphoma in the QD group, and AIDS 
(worsening) in the BID group. Each of these AEs was early onset (by Day36 of the study) and may represent 
immune reconstitution system (IRS), although not reported as such by the investigator. The case of 
tuberculosis occurred in a subject with prior pulmonary TB, the case of immunoblastic lymphoma was newly 
diagnosed in the region of the kidney in a subject with lumbar pain at study entry, and the case of AIDS 
presented as progression of cryptococcal meningitis in a subject reported as having inadequately treated 
prior cryptococcal meningitis. None of these fatal adverse events was considered to be drug related 
Serious drug-related clinical AEs were very infrequent (1/531 [0.2%] QD; 2/266 [0.8%] BID). The 1 serious 
drug-related AE in the QD group was headache, and was considered related to TRUVADATM and not 
raltegravir. The 2 serious drug-related AEs in the BID group included a transient increase in RNA (drug 
ineffective), and vomiting considered related to an overdose (2 extra tablets of placebo). No subjects 
discontinued from the study due to serious drug-related adverse events. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/294/877/2017 
Page 32/44 
  
  
Clinical AEs leading to discontinuation (0.8% QD, 2.3% BID) or clinical AEs associated with IRS (2.1% QD, 
1.1% BID) or AIDS defining condition (1.3% QD, 2.3% BID) occurred at similar and low frequencies in both 
treatment groups. 
Laboratory findings 
The frequencies of treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities were similar for raltegravir 1200 mg QD (2 x 
600 mg tablets) and raltegravir 400 mg BID Laboratory adverse events (7.0% QD; 11.3% BID) and drug-
related laboratory adverse event (1.5% QD; 1.5% BID) were reported at low and comparable frequencies in 
the raltegravir 1200 mg QD (2 x 600 mg tablets) and raltegravir 400 mg BID groups. 
Of the tests performed in routine monitoring, the most frequently (≥ 2% of subjects in one or more 
treatment groups) reported laboratory adverse events, regardless of drug relationship, were blood creatine 
phosphokinase increased (3.4%, 6.4%), and AST increased (2.6%, 1.9%) in the QD and BID groups, 
respectively. 
Overall the frequencies of Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities were similar in the two groups: AST (8/530 
QD group, 1/266 BID group), ALT (7/530 QD group, 1/266 BID group), and CPK (16/530 QD group, 11/266 
BID group) occurred at similar frequencies in both treatment groups. Grade 3 or 4 ALT elevations occurred 
concurrently with Grade 2, 3 or 4 AST in a number of subjects in both groups (7/530 QD group and 1/266 
BID group. In most cases, Grade 3 or 4 ALT elevations (with or without AST elevations) were self-limited and 
did not recur or require treatment interruption or had alternative aetiologies, such as viral hepatitis or use of 
hepatotoxic drugs. 
Of the 7 cases of ALT elevations to Grade 3 or above in the QD group; three cases were associated with viral 
hepatitis – 2 with acute hepatitis C infection (which, in one case, led to discontinuation), and 1 with flare of 
hepatitis B infection.  
Grade 3 or 4 CPK elevations occurred concurrently with Grade 2, 3, or 4 AST elevations in a number of 
subjects in both groups (6/530 [0.7%] QD; 4/266 [0.4%]). In most cases, Grade 3 or 4 CPK elevations (with 
or without AST elevations) were self-limited and did not recur or require treatment interruption. There were 
no cases associated with significant muscular conditions such as myositis or rhabdomyolysis. One subject in 
the QD group with Grade 3 or 4 CPK was discontinued due to recurrent CPK elevation without any associated 
clinical findings. 
While Grade 3 and 4 lipase elevations were observed in both groups (13/530 [2.4%] QD; 1/266 [0.4%]), this 
was generally clinically silent, other than one subject in the QD group who had Grade 3 lipase with a 
concurrent diagnosis of pancreatitis, which persisted after resolution of the elevated lipase. No specific 
symptomatology was reported, no imaging was performed and amylase was not reported. 
Safety in special populations 
Adverse events were generally similar in patient sub-groups based on gender, age, ethnicity and race 
although there were very small sample sizes for some categories.  
The safety profile of raltegravir QD was not affected by the presence of chronic hepatitis B and/or C virus co-
infection, or by the use of gastric proton pump inhibitors and H2 blockers. Raltegravir 1200 mg QD (2 x 600 
mg tablets) was generally well tolerated in these subgroups

Page 33/44 
  
  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In study 292, it is noted that 4 (0.8%) and 6 (2.3%) subjects discontinued study therapy due to a clinical AE 
through Week 48 in the QD and BID groups respectively. These AEs included tuberculosis and other 
infections. There were no drug-related AEs that led to discontinuation in the QD group. In the BID group, 2 
drug-related AEs led to discontinuation: early-onset drug eruption (resolved) and late-onset 
thrombocytopenia (ongoing). 
Post marketing experience 
Raltegravir 600mg tablets have not been previously marketed. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The applicant has provided a scanty description of the safety profile. This is not considered to be a significant 
concern as the safety of raltegravir 400mg b.i.d is well known.  
The most frequently reported clinical adverse events were headache, nausea and diarrhoea. The incidence of 
these comparable in the two treatment groups i.e. the 1200mg QD and 400mg bid groups.   
Serious drug related adverse events are generally low in both treatment groups. However, there were three 
fatal adverse events tuberculosis and immunoblastic lymphoma in the QD group, and AIDS (worsening) in 
the BID group. These events were of early onset.  
In terms of laboratory findings, the frequency of treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities were similar 
for raltegravir 1200 mg QD (2 x 600 mg tablets) and raltegravir 400 mg BID.  
Clinical AEs leading to discontinuation occurred at similar and low frequencies in both treatment groups. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
From the limited information provided by the applicant, there are no particular concerns to highlight. 
Raltegravir 1200 QD (600mg X 2) appears comparable to raltegravir 400mg b.i.d

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
HIV is the virus that causes the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).  HIV infects and leads to a 
depletion of immune cells (CD4 + cells). As the CD4-positive cells are depleted, the host becomes 
increasingly susceptible to a variety of opportunistic pathogens and immune deficiency related diseases. 
ISENTRESS® is currently approved for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in patients 4 weeks of age or older. It 
is dosed twice daily (BID) in all current formulations. It is available and marketed as a 400 mg film-coated 
tablet formulation for patients weighing at least 25 kg, as a chewable tablet formulation in 100 mg (scored) 
and 25 mg strengths for patients weighing at least 10 kg, and as granules for suspension in patients 
weighing at least 3 kg.  This particular application concerns a 600 mg film-coated tablet formulation which 
has been developed for use as two tablets (1200 mg) taken once daily (QD). The intention is to simplify and 
provide a more convenient treatment option by providing a once daily dosing for HIV-1 patients both infected 
treatment-naïve patients and patients who are virologically suppressed on an initial regimen of ISENTRESS® 
400 mg BID as it is considered that this might facilitate and improve the probability of achieving and 
maintaining optimal efficacy.

3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
A number of agents are licensed to treat HIV-1 infection  which include 6 distinct mechanistic classes: 
nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors 
(NNRTIs), protease inhibitors (PIs), fusion/entry inhibitors (EIs), integrase strand transfer inhibitors (InSTI; 
also commonly referred to as integrase inhibitors), and pharmacokinetic enhancers. Current guidelines 
recommend 2 NRTIs and a third agent, generally of the InSTI or PI class. 
HIV infection requires life-long therapy, and patients must adhere to treatment to avoid virologic failure and 
the development of resistance. HIV-infected patients often have concomitant medical conditions, 
necessitating the use of multiple medications for non-HIV related conditions. Thus, any measure to simplify 
HIV treatment increases the potential for improved adherence and overall therapeutic success. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The pivotal study was a Phase 3, multicentre, double-blind, randomised, active comparator controlled clinical 
study which evaluated the safety and efficacy of raltegravir 1200 mg QD (2 x 600 mg tablets) versus 
raltegravir 400 mg BID, each in combination with TRUVADA, in treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected subjects.  
A total of 802 subjects were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to Raltegravir 1200 mg once daily (QD; 2 x 600 mg 
tablets) or Raltegravir 400 mg twice daily (BID; 1 x 400 mg tablet in combination with TRUVADA™.  
Randomisation was stratified by RNA levels at screening and hepatitis B/C status, using centralised 
randomisation. 
The study was designed to evaluate the antiretroviral activity of reformulated raltegravir 1200 mg QD, 
compared to raltegravir 400 mg BID, each in combination therapy with TRUVADA, as measured by the 
proportion of subjects achieving HIV-1 RNA <40 copies/mL at Week 48. The FDA snapshot approach was 
used to determine virologic response (HIV RNA < 40 copies/mL) at Week 48.   
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary analysis was based on the FAS (n=797), which included all randomised subjects who were 
treated. Similar rates for sustained virologic success were achieved through Week 48 in both treatment 
groups. Estimates of the difference (95% CI) in the proportions of subjects with HIV RNA < 40 copies / mL at 
Week 48, based on the FDA snapshot approach was 0.510 (-4.204, 5.223).  The lower limit of the 95% 
confidence interval excluded the pre-defined margin of -10%.  For the PP population, using the FDA snapshot 
approach (NC=F) for missing data, similarly high proportions of subjects achieved HIV-1 RNA <40 copies/mL 
at Week 48 in the QD and BID treatment groups: 93.2% (455/488) versus 91.3% (232/254), respectively, 
with a treatment difference [95% CI] of 1.891% [-2.249, 6.032]. This demonstrates the non-inferiority of QD 
versus BID given the lower bound of the 95% CI is greater than -10%. 
In terms of secondary endpoints in particular CD4 counts,  time to virologic response (TVR), time to loss of 
virologic response (TLOVR), The proportion of subjects achieving HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL and the 
proportion of subjects achieving HIV-1 RNA <200 copies/mL, the results for Raltegravir 1200mg QD were 
demonstrated to be comparable to Raltegravir  400mg b.i.d. 
The results from the sensitivity and subgroup analyses are generally consistent with the primary analysis.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The primary outcome has been based only on the FAS. However since this is a non-inferiority study, the 
outcome should have been based on both the FAS and PP populations. Therefore the PP population was 
defined retrospectively 
Compliance with study treatment was good overall and the dropout rates were low and similar in both 
treatment groups (less than 10%).  However, there were a number of protocol deviations including GCP non-
compliance, assessment of efficacy, and violations of the entry criteria.   
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The most frequently reported clinical adverse events were headache, nausea and diarrhoea. The incidence of 
these comparable in the two treatment groups i.e. the 1200mg QD and 400mg bid groups.  The incidence of 
headache (13.4% in the 1200mg QD group and 10.9% in the 400mg bid group, nausea (11.3% in the 
1200mg QD group and 9.8% in the 400mg bid group and diarrhoea (10.9% in the 1200mg QD group 11.3% 
in the 400mg bid group).  
Serious drug related adverse events are generally low in both treatment groups. However, there were three 
fatal adverse events: tuberculosis and immunoblastic lymphoma in the QD group, and AIDS (worsening) in 
the BID group. These events were of early onset and probably IRS.   
In general, adverse events were generally similar in patient sub-groups based on gender, age, ethnicity and 
race.  Overall, the safety profile of raltegravir 1200 QD (600mg X 2) appear comparable to that of raltegravir 
400mg b.i.d. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There are no limitations and uncertainties about unfavourable effects that have an impact on the benefit-risk 
balance

3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Evidence of clinical efficacy is provided from a single pivotal study in treatment-naïve HIV infected subjects. 
The primary analysis was based on the FAS (n=797), which included all randomised subjects who were 
treated. Similar rates for sustained virologic success were achieved through Week 48 in both treatment 
groups. Estimates of the difference (95% CI) in the proportions of subjects with HIV RNA < 40 copies / mL at 
Week 48, based on the FDA snapshot approach was 0.510 (-4.204, 5.223).  The lower limit of the 95% 
confidence interval excluded the pre-defined margin of -10% and was well away from the pre-defined non-
inferiority margin. However since this is a non-inferiority study, the outcome should have been based on both 
the FAS and PP populations. Therefore the PP population will need to be defined retrospectively using a 
standard definition from published trials.  
In terms of the adverse events these were generally low in both treatment groups and the adverse events 
were generally similar in patient sub-groups based on gender, age, ethnicity and race.  Overall, the safety 
profile of raltegravir 1200 QD (600mg X 2) appear comparable to that of raltegravir 400mg b.i.d.  
There are no significant concerns to note regarding the unfavourable effects that have a negative impact on 
the benefit risk of raltegravir 1200 QD.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Raltegravir 1200mg QD  has been demonstrated to be non-inferior to Raltegravir bid in achieving HIV-1 RNA 
< 40 copies/mL at week 48 using the NC=F approach as defined by FDA “snapshot” approach and the 
Observed Failure (OF) approach for the FAS  and for the PP population.  In terms of the adverse events, 
there are no significant concerns to note. 
The benefit risk for the proposed new posology is considered to be positive. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Isentress is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
risk-benefit balance of Isentress 600 mg film-coated tablets is favourable in the following indication: 
Isentress 600 mg film coated tablets is indicated in combination with other anti-retroviral medicinal products 
for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV 1) infection in adults, and paediatric patients 
weighing at least 40 kg (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2). 
The CHMP therefore recommends extension of the marketing authorisation for Isentress subject to the 
following conditions:

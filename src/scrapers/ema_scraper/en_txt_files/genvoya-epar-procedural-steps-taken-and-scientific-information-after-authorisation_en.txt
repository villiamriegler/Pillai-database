Co-administration of clopidogrel with cobicistat is expected 
to decrease clopidogrel active metabolite plasma 
concentrations, which may reduce the antiplatelet activity 
of clopidogrel. Co-administration of Genvoya with 
clopidogrel is not recommended. 
Genvoya is not expected to have a clinically relevant effect 
on plasma concentrations of the active metabolite of 
prasugrel. No dose adjustment of prasugrel is required.

in these patients. No clinically relevant differences in 
tenofovir alafenamide pharmacokinetics were observed in 
patients with end stage renal disease on chronic 
haemodialysis as compared to those with normal renal 
function. Efficacy was maintained through 48 weeks but 
emtricitabine exposure was significantly higher than in 
patients with normal renal function. Although there were no 
new safety issues identified, the implications of increased 
emtricitabine exposure remain uncertain.  
Therefore, it is recommended that Descovy, Genvoya and 
Odefsey should generally be avoided but may be used in 
adults with end stage renal disease (estimated CrCl < 15 
mL/min) on chronic haemodialysis if the potential benefits 
are considered to outweigh the potential risks. No dose 
adjustment is required in these patients. Based on this,

wording, as per the revised Annex to the European 
Commission guideline on ‘Excipients in the labelling

The results from a prospective study (IMPAACT P1026s) 
showed that treatment with cobicistat and elvitegravir-
containing regimens during pregnancy results in lower 
elvitegravir and cobicistat exposures. Cobicistat levels 
decrease and may not provide sufficient boosting.  The 
substantial reduction in elvitegravir and darunavir exposure 
may result in virological failure and an increased risk of 
mother-to-child transmission of HIV infection.  Based on 
this, the product information for Genvoya, Stribild and 
Tybost have been updated to recommend that therapy with 
these therapies should not be initiated during pregnancy, 
and women who become pregnant during therapy should 
be switched to an alternative regimen.

Elvitegravir/Cobicistat/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Alafenamide 
(E/C/F/TAF) evaluated in 72 adult patients co infected with 
Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV 1) and chronic 
hepatitis B (HBV) in the open label Study GS-US-
29201249. Tenofovir alafenamide is active against hepatitis 
B virus (HBV). 
Of the patients who were HBeAg positive at baseline, 1/30 
(3.3%) achieved seroconversion to antibodies against 
hepatitis B e antigen (anti HBe) at Week 48. Of the patients 
who were HBsAg positive at baseline, 3/70 (4.3%) 
achieved seroconversion to anti HBs at Week 48. At Week 
48, 92% of patients (66/72) maintained HIV 1 RNA < 50 
copies/mL after switching to E/C/F/TAF. The mean change 
from baseline in CD4+ cell count at Week 48 was  2 
cells/mm3.  Ninety two percent (66/72 patients) had HBV

baseline, 59 remained suppressed and 3 had missing data. 
Of the 10 patients who were not HBV suppressed at 
baseline (HBV DNA ≥ 29 IU/mL), 7 became suppressed, 2 
remained detectable, and 1 had missing data.  Alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) normalisation was achieved in 40% 
(4/10) of subjects with ALT greater than upper limit of 
normal (ULN) at baseline. There are limited clinical data on 
the use of E/C/F/TAF in HIV/HBV co infected patients who 
are treatment naïve. 
The safety profile of emtricitabine and tenofovir 
alafenamide in combination with elvitegravir and cobicistat 
as a fixed dose combination tablet, in patients with 
HIV/HBV co infection, was similar to that in patients with 
HIV 1 monoinfection.

increases in serum creatinine occurred by Week 2 of 
treatment and remained stable through 144 weeks.  In 
treatment-naïve patients, a mean change from baseline of 
0.04 ± 0.12 mg/dL (3.5 ± 10.6 μmol/L) was observed after 
144 weeks of treatment.  Mean increases from baseline in 
the Genvoya group were smaller than in the elvitegravir

In studies in treatment naïve patients, increases from 
baseline were observed in both treatment groups for the 
fasting lipid parameters total cholesterol, direct low density 
lipoprotein (LDL)  and high density lipoprotein (HDL) 
cholesterol, and triglycerides at Week 144.  The median 
increase from baseline for those parameters was greater in 
the Genvoya group compared with the E/C/F/TDF group at 
Week 144 (p < 0.001 for the difference between treatment 
groups for fasting total cholesterol, direct LDL  and HDL 
cholesterol, and triglycerides).  The median (Q1, Q3) 
change from baseline in total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol 
ratio at Week 144 was 0.2 ( 0.3, 0.7) in the Genvoya group 
and 0.1 ( 0.4, 0.6) in the E/C/F/TDF group (p = 0.006 for 
the difference between treatment groups). 
In a pooled analysis, genotyping was performed on plasma 
HIV 1 isolates from antiretroviral-naïve patients receiving 
Genvoya in Phase 3 studies GS US 292 0104 and GS US 
292 0111 with HIV 1 RNA ≥ 400 copies/mL at confirmed 
virologic failure, Week 144, or time of early study drug 
discontinuation.  Up to Week 144, the development of one

or more primary elvitegravir, emtricitabine, or tenofovir 
alafenamide resistance-associated mutations was observed 
in HIV 1 isolates from 12 of 22 patients with evaluable 
genotypic data from paired baseline and Genvoya 
treatment-failure isolates (12 of 866 patients [1.4%]) 
compared with 12 of 20 treatment failure isolates from 
patients with evaluable genotypic data in the E/C/F/TDF 
treatment group (12 of 867 patients [1.4%]).  Of the HIV 1 
isolates from 12 patients with resistance development in 
the Genvoya group, the mutations that emerged were 
M184V/I (n = 11) and K65R/N (n = 2) in RT and 
T66T/A/I/V (n = 2), E92Q (n = 4), Q148Q/R (n = 1) and 
N155H (n = 2) in integrase.  Of the HIV 1 isolates from 12 
patients with resistance development in the E/C/F/TDF 
group, the mutations that emerged were M184V/I (n = 9), 
K65R/N (n = 4), and L210W (n = 1) in RT and E92Q/V (n = 
4), and Q148R (n = 2), and N155H/S (n = 3) in integrase.  
Most HIV 1 isolates from patients in both treatment groups 
who developed resistance mutations to elvitegravir 
developed resistance mutations to both emtricitabine and 
elvitegravir. 
In phenotypic analyses of patients in the final resistance 
analysis population, 7 of 22 patients (32%) had HIV 1 
isolates with reduced susceptibility to elvitegravir in the 
Genvoya group compared with HIV 1 isolates from 7 of 20 
patients (35%) in the E/C/F/TDF group, HIV 1 isolates from 
8 patients (36%) had reduced susceptibility to 
emtricitabine in the Genvoya group compared with HIV 1 
isolates from 7 patients (35%) in the E/C/F/TDF group. One 
patient in the Genvoya group (1 of 22 [4.5%]) and 2 
patients in the E/C/F/TDF group (2 of 20 [10%]) had 
Page 27/35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reduced susceptibility to tenofovir. 
Genvoya met the non inferiority criteria demonstrated 
statistical superiority in achieving HIV 1 RNA < 50 
copies/mL when compared to E/C/F/TDF at Week 144.  The 
difference in percentage was 4.2% (95% CI: 0.6% to 
7.8%).   
Changes in measures of bone mineral density 
In studies in treatment naïve patients, Genvoya was 
associated with smaller reductions in bone mineral density 
(BMD) compared to E/C/F/TDF as measured by DXA 
analysis of hip (mean change: −0.8% vs −3.4%, p < 
0.001) and lumbar spine (mean change: −0.9% vs −3.0%, 
p < 0.001) after 144 weeks of treatment.   
Improvements in BMD were noted at 96 weeks after 
switching to Genvoya from a TDF-containing regimen 
compared to maintaining the TDF-containing regimen. 
In studies in treatment naïve patients, Genvoya was 
associated with a lower impact on renal safety parameters 
(as measured after 144 weeks treatment by estimated 
glomerular filtration rate by Cockcroft Gault method, and 
urine protein to creatinine ratio and after 96 weeks 
treatment by urine albumin to creatinine ratio) compared to 
E/C/F/TDF (see also section 4.4). Through 144 weeks of 
treatment, no subject discontinued Genvoya due to a 
treatment emergent renal adverse event compared with 12 
subjects who discontinued E/C/F/TDF (p < 0.001).

Update of section 4.5 of the SmPC for Genvoya, 
Descovy and Odefsey with new information regarding 
interactions with  oral contraceptives norgestimate 
and ethinyl estradiol, from the final clinical study 
report (CSR) for Study GS-US-311-1790: "A Phase 
1, Randomized, Open Label, Drug Interaction Study

contraceptives have been listed as having an interaction 
with the individual components of Descovy, Genvoya and 
Odefsey: Norgestimate (0.180/0.215/0.250 mg once daily), 
ethinylestradiol (0.025 mg once daily). 
The recommendation concerning their co-administration 
with Descovy is that no dose adjustment of 
norgestimate/ethinylestradiol is required.  Descovy should 
be dosed according to the concomitant antiretroviral in line 
with section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
The recommendation concerning their co-administration 
with Odefsey is that no dose adjustment is required. 
The recommendation concerning the co-administration of a 
hormonal contraceptive with Genvoya is that caution should 
be exercised.  The hormonal contraceptive should contain 
at least 30 µg ethinylestradiol and contain norgestimate as 
the progestagen or patients should use an alternative 
reliable method of contraception. 
The long-term effects of substantial increases in 
progesterone exposure are unknown.  The effect of co 
administration of Genvoya with oral contraceptives 
containing progestagens other than norgestimate is not 
known and therefore should be avoided.

suppressed (n = 242) with mild to moderate renal 
impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate by 
Cockcroft Gault method [eGFRCG]: 30 69 mL/min) received 
emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide in combination 
with elvitegravir and cobicistat as a fixed-dose combination 
tablet. 
At Week 96, 88.4% (214/242 patients) maintained HIV 1 
RNA < 50 copies/mL after switching to emtricitabine and 
tenofovir alafenamide given with elvitegravir and cobicistat 
as a fixed-dose combination tablet.   
Nucleos(t)ide analogues may impact mitochondrial function 
to a variable degree, which is most pronounced with 
stavudine, didanosine and zidovudine. There have been 
reports of mitochondrial dysfunction in HIV negative infants 
exposed in utero and/or postnatally to nucleoside 
analogues; these have predominantly concerned treatment 
with regimens containing zidovudine. The main adverse 
reactions reported are haematological disorders (anaemia, 
neutropenia) and metabolic disorders (hyperlactatemia, 
hyperlipasemia). These events have often been transitory. 
Late onset neurological disorders have been reported rarely

current national recommendations to use antiretroviral 
therapy in pregnant women to prevent vertical 
transmission of HIV. 
If you have taken Genvoya during your pregnancy, your 
doctor may request regular blood tests and other diagnostic 
tests to monitor the development of your child.  In children 
whose mothers took NRTIs during pregnancy, the benefit 
from the protection against HIV outweighed the risk of side 
effects.

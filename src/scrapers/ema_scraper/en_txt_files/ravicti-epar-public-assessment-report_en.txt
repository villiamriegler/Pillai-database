1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Horizon Therapeutics Limited submitted on 2 June 2014 an application for Marketing 
Authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for RAVICTI, through the centralised procedure 
falling within the Article 3(1) and point 4 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to 
the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 27 June 2013. 
RAVICTI, was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/10/733-739 on 10/06/2010. RAVICTI 
was designated as an orphan medicinal product in the following indication:  treatment of the following 
UCD sub-types: 
• Treatment of carbamoyl –phosphate- synthase 1 deficiency. (CPS) 
• Treatment of ornithine carbamoyltransferase deficiency (OTC), 
• Treatment of argininosuccinic aciduria(ASS), 
• Treatment of hyperargininaemia 
• Treatment of ornithine translocase deficiency (hyperornithinaemia-hyperammonaemia 
homocitrullinuria (HHH) syndrome) 
• Treatment of citrullinaemia (CITRIN) type 1 and type II   
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
“RAVICTI is indicated for use as a nitrogen-binding agent for chronic management of adult and 
paediatric patients ≥2 months of age with urea cycle disorders (UCDs – including deficiencies of 
carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (CPS), ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), argininosuccinate 
synthetase (ASS, also called citrullinemia I), argininosuccinate lyase (ASL, also called arginosuccinic 
aciduria), arginase I (ARG), CITRIN (also called citrullinemia II) and ornithine translocase (also called 
HHH [Hyperammonaemia-Hyperornithinemia-Homocitrullinemia Syndrome]) who cannot be managed 
by dietary protein restriction and/or amino acid supplementation alone. RAVICTI must be used with 
dietary protein restriction and, in some cases, dietary supplements (e.g., essential amino acids, 
arginine, citrulline, protein-free calorie supplements). 
Limitations of Use: RAVICTI is not indicated for the treatment of acute hyperammonemia in patients 
with UCDs because more rapidly acting interventions are essential to reduce plasma ammonia levels. 
The safety and efficacy of RAVICTI for the treatment of patient less than 2 months of age and/or 
patients with N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS) deficiency has not been established.” 
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan 
Medicinal Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Ravicti as an orphan medicinal product in the 
approved indication. The outcome of the COMP review can be found on the Agency's website: 
ema.europa.eu/Find medicine/Rare disease designations. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application. The applicant indicated 
Assessment report  
EMA/676925/2015  
Page 7/89 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
that glycerol phenylbutyrate was considered to be a new active substance. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0068/2014 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0068/2014 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indication. 
Applicant’s request for consideration 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance glycerol phenylbutyrate contained in the above medicinal 
product to be considered as a new active substance in comparison to sodium glycerol phenylbutyrate 
previously authorised in the Union and claimed that glycerol phenylbutyrate differs significantly in 
properties with regard to safety and efficacy from the already authorised substances. 
Protocol Assistance 
The applicant received Protocol Assistance from the CHMP on 18/11/2010. The Protocol Assistance 
pertained to quality, non-clinical and clinical aspects of the dossier.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Urea cycle disorders (UCDs) are very rare, serious and life threatening disorders comprising a group of 
inherited deficiencies of one of the enzymes or transporters involved in the urea cycle, which converts 
ammonia to urea. The absence or severe dysfunction of the enzymes or transporters results in the 
accumulation of toxic levels of ammonia in the blood and brain of affected patients (Brusilow, 1996). 
Although genetically distinct, the UCDs share important features and are therefore typically considered 
as a group. The most important clinical manifestations common to UCDs are attributable to 
hyperammonaemia. Management of the individual UCD subtypes is generally similar and involves 
decreasing ammonia production through reduction of protein in the diet, removal of excess ammonia 
via waste nitrogen scavenging drugs (e.g., NaPBA) and replacement of certain urea cycle 
intermediates (Table 2 below). 
Only a minority of UCD patients are diagnosed based on newborn screening (i.e., argininosuccinate 
synthetase (ASS), argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) and arginase (ARG) deficiency subtypes), and 
most UCD patients are therefore diagnosed after presenting with symptoms of hyperammonaemia. 
Because even severe (e.g., seizures, cerebral oedema, hyperventilation, posturing, coma) as well as 
more subtle (e.g., loss of appetite, headache, cyclical vomiting, somnolence, lethargy, fatigue,

disorientation, behavioural abnormalities, sleep disorders, delusions, hallucinations, psychosis, 
headaches, nausea, vomiting) manifestations are nonspecific, long delays in diagnosis are common 
(Rüegger, 2014, Nassogne, 2005). Some critically ill infants are misdiagnosed, for example, with 
sepsis, resulting in delayed treatment or death (Leonard, 2002).

management. For each subtype information whether the orphan designation was requested is also

In the EU, the only drug therapy approved for the treatment of UCDs include sodium phenylbutyrate 
(NaPBA) or carglumic acid for treatment of N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS) deficiency (approved 
both in the EU and US as CARBAGLU®). The tablet and powder formulations of sodium phenylbutyrate 
(NaPBA) were approved in the US in 1996 as BUPHENYL®, in the EU in 1999 as AMMONAPS® and in 
2013 as PHEBURANE® (different -formulation of the AMMONAPS powder) as adjunctive therapy in the 
chronic management of patients with carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (CPS), ornithine 
transcarbamylase (OTC), or  argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS) deficiencies with neonatal onset 
deficiency and in patients with late-onset disease (presenting after the first month of life) who have a 
history of hyperammonaemic encephalopathy. 
Based on data from various sources including the UCD Consortium sponsored and NIH-funded 
Longitudinal Study is estimated that there are approximately 2000 patients with UCDs in the US, 
approximately half of whom are diagnosed and approximately 400 of whom are taking NaPBA. The 
number of undiagnosed patients represents an educated guess based on estimates of incidence and 
the fact that only about one-third of UCD patients are detected by current newborn screening 
techniques (Summar, 2013).   
Since currently available data suggest that the overall prevalence of UCDs and distribution of subtypes 
is similar in Japan, North America and Europe (Summar, 2013, Auray-Blais, 2007, Applegarth, 2000), 
it is estimated that the number of UCD patients in EU member states is about 3400 patients, 
approximately half of whom are diagnosed and  less than 700 patients taking NaPBA).  
Elevated blood ammonia; i.e., hyperammonaemia, is the central problem in patients with impaired 
urea formation.  A complete inability to synthesize urea can result in dramatic hyperammonaemia 
leading to coma and death shortly after birth, whereas less severe defects in urea formation are 
typically associated with lesser degrees of hyperammonaemia and often present somewhat later in life. 
UCD management is aimed at prompt diagnosis and reducing production of ammonia through dietary 
protein restriction and, for patients in whom dietary measures are insufficient, control of blood 
ammonia through the use of waste nitrogen–scavenging drugs such as HPN-100 and NaPBA.  
RAVICTIi (HPN-100) is a prodrug of phenylbutyric acid (PBA) and shares the same mechanism of 
action and metabolic pathway as NaPBA. It is hydrolyzed to glycerol and PBA in the gastrointestinal 
tract via pancreatic lipases. Because hydrolysis presumably only begins after HPN-100 exits the 
stomach and enters the proximal small intestine where it is exposed to pancreatic lipases, PBA 
delivered orally as HPN-100 enters the circulation about 75% more slowly than when delivered orally 
as NaPBA. Intact HPN-100 is not detected in the circulation of animals or humans. 
PBA is converted via β-oxidation to its active metabolite phenylacetic acid (PAA) (Kormanic, 2012), 
which is conjugated with glutamine to form phenylacetylglutamine (PAGN), which mediates waste

nitrogen removal through urinary excretion. Because glutamine contains two nitrogen atoms, excretion 
of one mol of PAGN results in removal of two moles of nitrogen, the same as when urea is excreted in 
urine. Not only does glutamine participate in this alternative pathway for elimination of waste nitrogen, 
but glutamine levels correlate with plasma ammonia levels and symptoms in UCD patients, and its 
intracellular accumulation in glial cells is believed to mediate cerebral oedema (Butterworth, 2009; 
Maestri, 1992; Tuchman, 2008). 
The development of HPN-100 builds upon more than 30 years of published clinical experience with the 
use of sodium phenylacetate (NaPAA) and NaPBA for treatment of UCDs as well as 15 years of post-
marketing experience with NaPBA. The rationale for clinical development of HPN-100 was to offer to 
UCD patients an alternative to NaPBA with sustained-release characteristics that would provide better 
nitrogen-scavenging and ammonia control, in a formulation that does not contain sodium or sugar, 
eliminates the substantial pill burden, as well as the bad taste and odour associated with NaPBA, which 
are reported to compromise compliance in many patients. 
2.2.  About the product 
Glycerol phenylbutyrate (HPN-100) is a nitrogen-binding agent.  HPN-100 consists of three molecules 
of phenylbutyric acid (PBA) joined to glycerol by ester linkage to form a short-chain triglyceride, which 
appears to be digested by pancreatic lipases to release PBA (Lowe, 2009).  Because the synthesis of 
each molecule of glutamine requires two nitrogen molecules, the body excretes two nitrogen molecules 
with each molecule of phenylacetylglutamine (PAGN). This is the same stoichiometry as for urea, each 
molecule of which also contains two nitrogen molecules.  The biotransformation of HPN-100 is 
summarized in the following figure:

a This conversion likely involves more than one enzyme present in liver and kidney 
(Moldave 1957) 
Overall, plasma concentrations of PBA and its metabolites in adults generally displayed less fluctuation 
following HPN-100 as compared to NaPBA treatment. In studies involving a comparison of TID dosing 
with HPN-100 versus NaPBA, the fluctuation between minimum and maximum metabolite levels in 
Assessment report

plasma (Cmin-ss versus Cmax-ss and decreasing again to Cmin-ss) was less pronounced in adult patients 
with UCDs after dosing TID with HPN-100 than with NaPBA. These differences in plasma fluctuation are 
consistent with the conclusion that in adults, PBA delivered as HPN-100 is absorbed more slowly from 
the gastrointestinal tract than when delivered as NaPBA, presumably reflecting the time required for 
digestion of HPN-100 by pancreatic lipases. Slower absorption of PBA results in more sustained levels 
of the active downstream metabolites, PAA and PAGN. The results suggest further that despite 
differences in plasma metabolite levels with HPN-100 and NaPBA, the extent of PBA absorption as 
measured by U-PAGN is very similar for the two drugs. This disparity in plasma level and U-PAGN likely 
reflects the fact that PBA undergoes variable fractional conversion to PAA and PAGN during first-pass 
metabolism and prior to reaching the systemic circulation.

2.3.2.  Active Substance 
General information

phenylbutyrate) and has the following structure: 
Molecular formula: C33H38O6
Assessment report  
EMA/676925/2015

Glycerol phenylbutyrate is a clear, colourless to pale yellow liquid with a density of 1.1 g /ml which is 
insoluble in water, but freely soluble in toluene and acetone. 
Glycerol phenylbutyrate has a non-chiral molecular structure.  
The methods used for elucidation of structure and characterisation were elemental analysis, infrared 
(IR) spectroscopy, ultraviolet (UV)-visible spectroscopy, mass spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic 
resonance spectroscopy  (1H-NMR and 13C-NMR), optical rotation, thermal analysis and residue on 
ignition all of which support the chemical structure. 
In accordance with Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC, New Active Substance status was claimed.  
Glycerol phenylbutyrate is considered as a derivative of sodium phenylbutyrate.   
Significant differences in part are linked to the modified release characteristics to provide better 
efficacy throughout the day vis-à-vis sodium phenylbutyrate and thereby reducing the number of 
hyperammonemia crisis, whereas reference is made to the clinical assessment and difference observed 
in the clinical efficacy/safety of glycerol phenylbutyrate compared to sodium phenylbutyrate.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Originally 2 sources of glycerol phenylbutyrate were proposed. However, one of them has been 
withdrawn after implementation of an improved manufacturing process by the current manufacturer. 
Therefore, a number of issues related to the withdrawn manufacturer became obsolete, whereas some 
data are still used as supportive where applicable.   
Glycerol phenylbutyrate is synthesized in multiple steps using well defined starting materials with 
acceptable specifications.  
Information on starting materials is considered acceptable after provision of further information upon 
request of the CHMP. Sufficient information on raw materials, synthesis and specifications of 4-PBA has 
been provided and accepted.  
No intermediates are isolated in the manufacturing process of glycerol phenylbutyrate. The identified 
critical steps for the process and their means of control are presented.  The process is controlled by a 
combination of acceptable material specifications and in-process controls (IPCs).   
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances.  
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised.  
The majority of active substance used in non-clinical and clinical material was then produced by the 
former manufacturer. In late 2009, an alternative active substance process was developed at the 
current manufacturer for the proposed commercial manufacturing process with the goal to use a 
commercially available catalyst and to improve the impurity profile. The synthetic routes are slightly 
different between the 2 manufacturers. However, characterisation studies revealed the same structure 
of active substance and comparable impurity profile for the current manufacturer due to the use of 
different solvents.  
All components used in storage of the active substance are safe for pharmaceutical and food use. 
Specification 
Assessment report  
EMA/676925/2015  
Page 14/89 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, solubility, identification (IR, HPLC), 
Water Content (Karl Fischer), Assay (HPLC), Related Substance/Impurities (HPLC), Sulphated Ash, 
Heavy Metals and Residual Solvent (GC). Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold 
according to ICH Q3A were qualified and appropriate specifications have been set. The analytical 
methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately validated in 
accordance with ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for 
assay and impurities testing has been presented.  
The limit set for unknown/unspecified impurities had initially not been considered acceptable and it has 
been requested to tighten this limit in line with the ICH Q3A guideline ‘impurities in new drug 
substance’. 
An impurity was identified during the stability program and is therefore monitored.  Based on in silico 
assessment, no structural alerts were identified for this impurity which has been controlled 
quantitatively based on additional justification. 
Batch analyses data of seven commercial-scale drug substance batches including 3 registration 
batches, 3 process validation batches and one commercial batch, were provided and demonstrated 
that the active substance can be manufactured reproducibly. 
Stability 
Satisfactory stability data according to ICH Q1A on 6 commercial scale batches (3 registration batches, 
3 process validation batches) of active substance stored in a representative container closure system 
for 48 months under long term conditions at 25°C/60% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated 
conditions at 40°C/75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The following parameters 
were tested: appearance, water content, assay, related substances/impurities (HPLC), microbial limits 
(total aerobic count, total yeast and mold) and specific pathogens. Glycerol phenylbutyrate (GPB) 
active substance stability will be continued to be monitored in accordance with the proposed protocol. 
Photostability testing was performed according to ICH Q1B. Results showed a very low increase in total 
impurities when the product is exposed to direct, high intensity light. 
The stability results support the proposed retest period of 12 months when stored between 15-30°C. 
2.3.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is intended for oral administration only and is composed of pure glycerol 
phenylbutyrate (GPB) active substance, a clear colourless to pale yellow liquid. The finished product is 
undiluted and unformulated GPB drug substance filled into glass bottles.  
Glycerol phenylbutyrate active substance is a nearly odourless, tasteless liquid that is insoluble in 
water.  
The primary packaging is a 25 ml clear glass bottle capped with a reclosable bottle cap adaptor. Each 
carton contains 1 bottle of 25 ml.  The material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The choice 
of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended 
use of the product.

In order to address the requirement of supplying liquid paediatric medicine with a measuring device as 
outlined in the Guideline on pharmaceutical development of medicines for paediatric use, a starter pack 
consisting of syringes (1ml, 3ml, or 5 ml) and corresponding to 7 syringes of an appropriate size per 
prescribed dose in total, is proposed for the first prescription (after initiation of treatment only the 
bottle and cap adapter are provided and syringes need to be bought from the pharmacy).  The starter 
pack will be used for all age groups including paediatric population. 
The container closure system was tested for extractables and leachables as well as deliverable volume. 
The results revealed no safety concern and were deemed satisfaocry. 
Dose accuracy with the proposed delivery devices (as described in Section 4.2. of the SPC) has been 
properly investigated and found acceptable. However dose recovery through feeding tube was only 
70% for a 0.5 ml dose. This issue is  reflected in Section 4.2. and 6.5. of the SPC. The root cause of 
the 70% dose recovery for the 0.5 ml dose should be investigated and nasogastric tubes made of 
alternate materials such as polyvinylchloride or polyurethane should be explored (see 2.3.6. 
Recommendations for future quality development). 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product manufacturing process consists of the filling of unformulated, neat glycerol 
phenylbutyrate (GPB) active substance into bottles. In-process checks include fill weight, cap torque 
removal, and label verification and are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and 
pharmaceutical form. 
Process validation demonstrates that the packaging process for the 25 ml fill bottle is suitable to meet 
predetermined criteria for fill volume (volume by weight), torque removal testing, and neck banding. 
Three batches of drug product ranging in scale from 300 kg to 700 kg were used for validation studies. 
It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product 
of intended quality in a reproducible manner.  
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: 
Appearance (Visual), Identification (FTIR), Identification (HPLC), Water Content (Karl Fischer), Assay 
(HPLC) and Related Substances/Impurities (HPLC). 
In-house HPLC methods are used for assay, identification and related substances and have been 
validated according to ICH Q2 (R1). All other tests carried out on the finished product are in 
accordance with the European Pharmacopoeia. Satisfactory information regarding the reference 
standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented.  
Batch analysis results are provided for 3 process validation batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
Stability of the product 
Originally, the proposed shelf life was suggested as 36 months at not more than 25°C. 
Stability data of 3 finished product batches produced by the previous finished product manufacturer 
(but with the active substance from the current active substance manufacturer) stored under long term 
Assessment report  
EMA/676925/2015  
Page 16/89 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
conditions for 24 months at 25°C / 60% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 
40°C / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
Stability studies have been carried out on batches of the finished product packaged in the proposed 
container closure system (upright and inverted). 
The following parameters were investigated, using the analytical methods for release of the finished 
product: appearance, water content, assay, related substances/impurities and microbial limits. The 
analytical methods were shown to be stability indicating. 
Initially, 24 months stability data generated by the previous finished product manufacturer could not 
be considered as fully supportive as the site has never been registered. A protocol for stability testing 
with process validation batches manufactured at the approved finished product manufacturer and in 
accordance with ICH guidelines has been provided. Upon request, further updated stability data (12 
months for one batch, 9 months for two batches) from the approved finished product manufacturer 
have been provided, but the AS had been manufactured by the AS manufacturer no longer used. 
Scientific discussion on comparative stability data, manufacturing process and container closure 
system supported the use of the stability data generated by previous finished product manufacturer 
and eventually a tightened shelf-life of 12 months was considered acceptable. A commitment to 
provide real time stability data as they become available from the approved manufacturers is also 
provided. 
A photostability study according to ICH Q1B has been undertaken. Clarification with regard to slight 
increase of impurities in samples exposed to light has been provided and is deemed acceptable.  
An in-use stability study was conducted on one batch of finished product. Two bottles of finished 
product were fitted with reclosable bottle cap adapter, kept in inverted position for 3 days and tested 
for potency and purity. The results of testing revealed no change in potency and no signs of 
degradation (impurities) for the duration of the study and support the instruction in the SPC section 
6.3 “After the first opening of the medicinal product container, the medicinal product must be used 
within 3 days”. However the extension of the in-use shelf-life should be investigated to avoid wastage 
of the finished product when used in paediatric population (see 2.3.6 Recommendations for future 
quality development).  
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life as stated in the SPC (1 year without any special storage 
conditions) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No materials of human or animal origin are used in the active substance or finished product 
manufacture. A compliance statement certifying the TSE status of the glycerol phenylbutyrate has 
been provided. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Ravicti is a clear colourless to pale yellow liquid containing 1.1 g glycerol phenylbutyrate per ml. The 
finished product is intended for oral administration only and is composed of undiluted and 
unformulated glycerol phenylbutyrate active substance. After implementation of an improved active 
substance manufacturing process, proof of similarity of active substance has been provided. 
Satisfactory stability data including comparative stability data support a shelf life that has been

tightened to currently 12 months, whereas real time stability data will be submitted upon availability. A 
reclosable bottle cap adaptor will be supplied in the outer carton with the medicinal product. For the 
initial prescription, CE marked oral dosage syringes will be provided as a starter pack (after initiation of 
treatment syringes need to be bought from the pharmacy).  
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.3.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation:  
1-  The root cause of the 70% dose recovery for the 0.5 ml dose should be investigated and 
nasogastric tubes made of alternate materials such as polyvinylchloride or polyurethane should 
be explored. 
2-  The extension of the in-use shelf-life should be investigated to avoid wastage of the finished 
product when used in paediatric population. 
2.4.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
2.4.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
No primary pharmacodynamic studies were performed with GPB or its metabolites (PBA and PAA).  
This has mainly been described from the scientific literature on PBA, PAA, and PAGN, supplemented in 
parts with pharmacokinetic and toxicological study observations.   
Glycerol phenylbutyrate (GPB) is designed to be a prodrug of PBA, and it consists of three PBA 
molecules linked via an ester bond to a glycerol backbone.  In the gastrointestinal tract digestive 
lipases facilitate rapid and extensive hydrolysis of GPB, resulting in the production of PBA (Lowe 2009 
and Study A3091-11).  Recombinant human pancreatic lipases, which are present in the 
gastrointestinal tract of adults and neonates, were shown in vitro to hydrolyse GPB to PBA (Figure 
2.1.1).  The pancreatic lipase related protein 2, carboxyl ester lipase, and pancreatic triglyceride lipase 
were all shown to cleave PBA from GPB.   
Figure 2.1.1:  Biochemical Formation of GPB to PBA and Glycerol 
Assessment report  
EMA/676925/2015  
Page 18/89 
 
 
 
 
 
According to Raper (1928), following oral absorption, PBA undergoes β-oxidation to PAA.  PAA is the 
substrate for the metabolic processes that conjugate glutamine in the liver (and kidney) through the 
enzyme phenylacetyl-coenzyme A (CoA):L-glutamine-N-acetyltransferase to form PAGN (Batshaw, 
2001; Moldave, 1957; Webster, 1976), which is subsequently eliminated by glomerular filtration and 
renal tubular secretion in the urine (James, 1972).  An exogenous source of PAA is believed to arise as 
a breakdown product of phenylalanine by bacteria in the intestine; the endogenous source is from 
oxidative deamination of phenethylamine (from phenylalanine) and in primates is conjugated with 
glutamine (Seakins, 1971).  PAGN is formed only in higher primates and humans (James, 1972; 
Kasumov, 2004).  
Phenylacetyl-CoA + L-glutamine  CoA + α-N-phenylacetyl-L-glutamine 
In animals other than primates, PAA conjugates with glycine (instead of glutamine) to form PAG 
instead of PAGN (Moldave, 1957).  Oral administration of PAA to dogs has there to be increased 
urinary excretion of glycine 7-fold over 24 h (Quick, 1933).  It is noted that this difference in PAA 
conjugation between primates (including humans) and other mammalian species is related to the 
substrate specificity of phenylacetyl CoA:acetyltransferase, which is located in the mitochondria of the 
liver and kidney (Schachter, 1954; Webster, 1976).  PAA is also found in urine, conjugated to either 
glutamine in primates or to glycine in other species, and conjugated to glucuronide (McQuade, 1984; 
Teuchy, 1971). 
Figure 2.1.2:  Biochemical Formation of PAGN (Phenylacetylglutamine) 
The review is limited, however given the extensive knowledge accumulated for PAA and PBA this is 
sufficient to demonstrate the pharmacological effect of PBA (pro-drug) and PAA (active moiety) to bind 
waste nitrogen, and that this is then excreted into the urine as PAGN.

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamic studies were performed with GPB or its metabolites. Given the 
pharmacological nature of GPB and its metabolites this is acceptable.   
Safety pharmacology programme 
A range of GLP safety pharmacology studies has been performed with GPB using both in vitro and in 
vivo models.  The organ systems evaluated include the CNS, cardiovascular system and respiratory 
system (Table 2.3.1). 
Cardiovascular system:  
An in vitro hERG study was completed using concentrations of PBA (pro-drug) and PAA (active 
constituent) well in excess of peak plasma exposures observed in clinical studies.  Concentrations 
shown to inhibit peak currents in the hERG assay were 46-fold (PBA) and 24-fold (PAA) in excess to 
clinically observed levels.  The potential of PBA and PAA to affect potassium channel current was 
reviewed using rabbit cardiac myocytes.  It was observed that concentrations of up to 1591.8 µg/mL of 
PBA and 305.2 µg/mL of PAA caused no change in cardiac myocyte tail currents.   
Two in vivo studies have been completed.  In the first in telemetered monkeys dosed orally with up to 
4 g/kg GPB. No significant treatment-related changes in heart rate or blood pressure were seen at any 
dose.  Treatment with 4 g/kg (48 g/m2) GPB affected cardiac ion channels (PR, QRS and QTc), and as 
confirmed below was also associated with CNS depressive effects such as hypo-activity, hunched 
posture, unsteady gait, piloerection, emesis, and loose faeces.  It is possible that these CNS effects 
may have influenced the cardiac changes, and so a second study to assess the arrhythmogenic 
potential of GPB was conducted in a Carlsson rabbit model.  Rabbits were treated with up to 300 
mg/kg GPB and there was no apparent change in cardiac parameters (heart rate, PR interval and QRS 
duration) detected. A significant increase in arterial blood pressure was observed at both doses tested 
in this study; the investigators and applicant suggest that this may be confounded by anaesthetic 
effects (methoxamine and/or the ketamine/xylazine).  Blood pressure changes have not been observed 
in associated studies and this explanation is considered acceptable in view of the limited cardiovascular 
changes observed. 
Central Nervous System:  
Adult cynomolgus monkeys were dosed orally with 1 and 4 g/kg GPB. No changes in behaviour or body 
temperature were detected at 1 g/kg, however at the higher dose there distinct signs of CNS 
depression occurring up to 24 hours after dosing, including a significant reduction in body temperature. 
The likelihood for CNS effects following GPB treatment is limited given the high margin of safety.  
Respiratory system: 
The effect on the respiratory system was investigated using conscious adult cynomolgus monkeys.  
Oral gavage dosing with GPB had little effect on any respiratory parameter at the high 4 g/kg dose. 
Overall, there are no issues regarding safety pharmacology identified. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No studies have been conducted to review pharmacodynamic interactions due to the mechanism of 
action GPB and its downstream products, PBA and PAA.  This is considered acceptable based on the 
pharmacological nature of the product. 
Assessment report  
EMA/676925/2015  
Page 20/89 
 
 
 
 
 
2.4.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of GPB was investigated after oral administration in the rat and cynomolgus 
monkey and in vitro by using animal and human tissues.   
Absorption  
In rats, oral administration at up to 650 mg/kg in male rats and 900 mg/kg in female rats resulted in 
similar exposure between single and repeat doses.  PBA exposure appeared to be lower in males as 
was total radioactivity, PBA, and PAA compared to females.  PAG levels were clearly higher in females 
after repeated dosing.  Radioactivity was rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, distributed 
widely throughout body organs and tissues.  
In the cynomolgus monkey, oral administration of a single GPB dose (600 mg PBA equivalents/kg) 
resulted in systemic exposure to about 10% PBA and to around 40% and 20% of its known 
metabolites PAA and PAGN, respectively. 
Distribution 
Oral administration of radiolabeled GPB in the cynomolgus monkey resulted in wide distribution of 
GPB-related material throughout the body (although the large intestine wall at 8 h post-dose was the 
only tissue to contain greater than 1% of the administered dose).  Tissue concentrations were 
generally highest at 8 h post-dose and were highest in the large intestine wall, bile, plasma, kidney, 
liver, urinary bladder, and whole blood.  Concentrations generally declined throughout the 72-h period, 
indicating no accumulation of radioactivity, but radioactivity was still measurable in all but the eyes, 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and brain at sacrifice.  
Overall, concentrations in the tissues of the central nervous system (CNS) were generally one of the 
lowest measured, indicating that GPB and/or its metabolites did not readily penetrate the blood–brain 
barrier.  Whole blood and blood cell /plasma ratios were <1 at all times, indicating that association of 
drug-derived material with red blood cells was limited.   
In a few tissues, particularly the major excretory organs (i.e., kidney and liver) and the more lipophilic 
tissues (i.e., skin, fat [peri-renal], and lymph nodes [mesenteric]), the tissue/plasma ratio increased 
from less than one at 8 h post-dose to 7.9–87 at over 72 h, indicating that drug-derived material was 
eliminated more quickly from the systemic circulation than from these tissues. 
Plasma protein binding 
In in vitro studies, plasma protein binding of PBA was moderate to high (up to 87.9–98%) for all 
species evaluated (mouse, rat, rabbit, monkey, and human).  For mouse, rat, monkey, and human 
plasma, plasma protein binding decreased with increasing dose so that the free fraction increased with 
PBA concentration.  For PAA, plasma protein binding was low to moderate (up to 15.2–76.4%) for all 
species.  Increasing free fractions were noted with increasing concentrations for all species, but only at 
higher concentrations in mouse and rat plasma.  For PAGN, the extent of plasma protein binding was 
low (1.3–12%) in rats, monkeys, and humans and exhibited no concentration effects. 
Metabolism 
A series of in vitro studies was conducted to determine the primary enzyme involved in the hydrolysis 
of GPB and to evaluate the relative risk of metabolism-based drug–drug interaction.  The results of 
these experiments showed that digestive lipases are the main enzymes responsible for hydrolysis of 
GPB.   
Assessment report  
EMA/676925/2015  
Page 21/89 
 
 
 
 
 
The metabolism of GPB was evaluated in vitro using hepatocytes from mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, 
monkeys, and humans.  The results of in vitro and in vivo studies show that in terms of metabolism of 
PBA and GPB, non-human primates are more closely aligned with human metabolism than are the 
mouse, rat, and rabbit.  As a result the toxicology program has been completed with cynomolgus 
monkeys (as non-rodent species).  This is adequate justification for use of chosen toxicological species.  
An in vitro evaluation of the pancreatic lipase activity against GPB showed that pancreatic lipase 
related protein 2 (PLRP2), carboxyl ester lipase (CEL), and pancreatic triglyceride lipase (PTL) can 
cleave PBA from GPB.  These data suggest that PLRP2 and CEL enzymes play a role in GPB hydrolysis 
in vivo and may contribute to effective digestion of GPB in the early neonatal period before PTL is 
present. 
Elimination 
In rats, PBA/PAA was almost exclusively excreted in urine, with 90-98% total urinary radioactivity 
recovered by 24 hours post-dose.  Approximately 60-90% of the administered dose was excreted in 
urine as PAG and 3 to 16% as hydroxylated PBA following single and repeat oral doses.  
Minor elimination of GPB occurred via faeces, which contained the metabolites PAA and PBA, and in 
bile, with the major components PAG and PAA. The levels of PAG were higher than PAA following 
repeat administration in males at the low and high dose, which is consistent with PAA levels increasing 
over time and indicated a capacity limited step in the metabolism of PAA to PAG.  Intact GPB was not 
detected within the systemic circulation or in any tissues or excreta analysed. 
After oral GPB administration, approximately 45% of the dose was eliminated in urine, of which about 
87% was in the form of PAGN.  A large fraction of the remaining dose (about 25%) was excreted in 
faeces, of which approximately 85% was in the form of PBA and likely represented unabsorbed GPB 
that had been hydrolysed after passing through the gastrointestinal tract. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
In vitro studies were conducted to evaluate the potential for GPB and PBA to induce and inhibit the 
cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes.  In human liver microsomes, both PBA and PAA were reversible 
inhibitors of human CYP.  GPB did not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4/5.  GPB 
treatment resulted in only slight (19–35%) inhibition of CYP2C9. An in vivo study to examine CYP2C9 
inhibition has been initiated by the applicant. The applicant is requested to submit the results by 
October 2015. 
The effects of PBA and PAA on CYP activity were greater than that seen with GPB.  With PBA, more 
than 60% inhibition occurred with CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5 (testosterone 6β-hydroxylase 
activity only).  PAA treatment resulted in ≥ 37% inhibition for CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, 
CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5.  Generally, inhibition at the 0 time point was similar to or less than at the 30-
min incubation time point, indicating that there was no time-dependent inhibition with GPB, PBA, or 
PAA and that inhibition was reversible.  
In cultured human hepatocytes, both PBA and PAA exhibited minimal induction of CYP1A2 and 
CYP3A4/5.   
It is noted that in human plasma and microsomes the half-lives for GPB hydrolysis were longer than 
that seen with lipase, so suggests that GPB is most likely hydrolysed in the gut lumen by digestive 
lipase, and therefore preventing direct intestinal absorption of GPB.  As a result the applicant suggests 
that there may be limited risk of esterase or CYP450 drug–drug interactions attributable to GPB.  This 
seems plausible. 
Assessment report  
EMA/676925/2015  
Page 22/89 
 
 
 
 
 
An investigation of PAA as an inhibitor of the drug transporters Pgp, BCRP, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, 
OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OCT1 has been initiated.  In addition the inhibition of Pgp and BCRP by GPB 
(HPN-100) will be examined.   
Other pharmacokinetic studies  
An in vitro study was completed to examine the hydrolysis of GPB and two impurities - tetra-ester 1 
and tetra-ester 2.  Each was rapidly hydrolysed to PBA in the presence of pancreatin or pancrelipase, 
indicating that GPB and tetra-esters are rapidly converted to PBA in the gut lumen before they can 
permeate the intestinal membrane. 
2.4.4.  Toxicology 
Single and repeated oral dose studies were conducted using GPB, in accordance with GLP in mice, rats, 
and monkeys. A full battery of genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, reproductive and developmental, and 
juvenile toxicity studies was also conducted using GPB. In addition, the genotoxic potential of the GPB 
metabolites PBA, PAA, PAGN, and PAG were assessed. 
Single dose toxicity 
Single dose toxicity studies have been conducted in rats and monkeys.  Tolerance to GPB was less so 
for rats, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) to rats was 0.9 g/kg/day (5.4 g/m2), and compared to 
monkeys which was > 6.5 g/kg (> 78 g/m2).  The applicant has related this potentially due to 
differences in glycine stores and relative systemic levels of PBA and PAA.   
Repeat dose toxicity 
The applicant has completed mid to long term repeat dose toxicity studies in three species: mice, rats 
and monkeys.  Mouse studies were designed primarily to establish condition suitable for the 6 month 
carcinogenicity study in transgenic (Tg.rasH2) mice.  Studies in rats were completed with dosing of up 
to 26 weeks, and in cynomolgus monkeys the duration was extended to 52 weeks.   
The data in mice has been utilised in the main to optimise dosing in the 26 week carcinogenicity study 
in transgenic (Tg.rasH2) mice.  Rats were treated with GPB for up to 26 weeks and monkeys for up to 
52 weeks.   
The applicant has performed a detailed level of studies to investigate potential toxicological 
consequences of repeated treatment with GPB, and thus extended exposure to its metabolites and 
active constituent, PBA and PAA, respectively.   
The NOAEL in the rat was 0.65 g/kg (3.9 g/m2); in the monkey, it was 4.5 g/kg (54 g/m2). 
The predominant changes noted in the general toxicology studies following GPB treatment relate to 
three aspects – changes to the CNS, the liver and the haematopoietic system.  It is noted that these 
studies have been conducted in healthy animals, and differences in the metabolic processes (rats), and 
retention of nitrogen (monkey) from UCD patients may help explain some of the adverse changes 
observed in these studies.   
Central Nervous System:  
Changes to the CNS were first observed in the safety pharmacology studies, in which neuro-
behavioural function was affected following acute treatment in monkey studies.  This was further 
observed in mice, rats and monkeys toxicity studies.  The CNS effects noted in these studies included 
tremors, hypoactivity, muscle rigidity, impaired equilibrium and impaired muscle coordination. These

effects were seen across species however they do not appear to be exacerbated on extended 
treatment with GPB.  NOAELs have been established for each species, each being in excess of 
anticipated clinical exposure. The safety margins from the pivotal chronic studies in rats and monkeys 
are 5.8 and 4.9 respectively.  
Liver:  
All species treated with GPB exhibited increased liver weights and this was associated with minimal to 
mild centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy (mice and monkeys).  Due to the metabolic process of 
converting GPB to the PAA, the applicant has detailed that the changes to the liver are the result of 
adaptive changes occurring in generating PAA, and are the result of hepatic enzyme induction. These 
changes are seen across species and are further confounded by the use of GPB in animals with a 
normal functioning urea cycle. It is also considered that the established NOAELs in each species 
provide a sufficient margin for safety, so these adaptive changes may be of limited concern.   
Haematopoietic system:  
Changes to the haematopoietic system were generally seen to be mild and not associated with 
histological correlates as no distinct changes were seen in the bone marrow. In rats and monkeys, the 
general trend was for reduced RBCs, haemoglobin, haematocrit and platelets. Thymus weights were 
reduced in rats treated with GPB over 14 days, however this was not seen in the longer duration 
studies and had no histological correlate so is of limited significance.  In addition in monkeys treated 
for 13-week dosing, 1 male and female each at 1.75 g/kg exhibited a small thymus that correlated 
with minimal lymphoid depletion.  Some females in this study also exhibited enlarged and discoloured 
lymph nodes at 1.75 g/kg/day.  It is agreed that haematopoietic changes can be considered to be mild 
and sufficient margins for safety are demonstrated.  
Genotoxicity 
GPB was shown to be non-mutagenic in both in vitro and in vivo studies.  Additional in vitro studies 
were conducted to examine the potential mutagenicity of its metabolites, in which it was shown that 
PBA, PAA, PAGN, and PAG were negative in Ames, and PAA, PAGN, and PAG were not mutagenic in 
chromosomal aberration assay.  Although PBA was shown to be positive for the induction of structural 
chromosome aberrations following metabolic activation, these findings were seen at potentially 
cytotoxic concentration levels, and further clastogenic examination using human peripheral blood 
lymphocytes was negative.  The weight of evidence would suggest negative potential clastogenicity 
with PBA. 
Carcinogenicity 
The long term safety of administering GPB was evaluated as part of a standard assay to examine 
potential carcinogenicity.  Two carcinogenicity studies were conducted.  The first is a 26 week oral 
carcinogenicity study in male and female hemizygous Tg.rasH2 mice.  Animals were treated daily with 
oral doses of GPB up to 1 g/kg/day for 26 weeks.  No evidence of tumour formation was detected in 
this study. 
In the second study, rats were dosed daily with 0.07, 0.21 and 0.65 g/kg/day to males and 0.10, 0.30 
and 0.90 g/kg/day to females of oral GPB for 104 weeks.  A number of neoplasms were detected in 
this study that can be attributed to treatment.  It is noted that GPB (PBA/PAA) has already been 
determined to be non-genotoxic.  These include findings of tumours in the adrenal gland, pancreas, 
thyroid, uterus, Zymbal’s gland, and cervix.   
Assessment report

In male rats, there were significant increases in incidence of pancreatic acinar cell adenomas (0.21 
g/kg/day), pancreatic acinar cell carcinomas (0.65 g/kg/day), adrenal cortical carcinomas (0.21 
g/kg/day), thyroid follicular cell adenomas (0.65 g/kg/day) and Zymbal’s gland carcinomas (≥0.21 
g/kg/day).  Pre-neoplastic findings in male rats were also observed as pancreatic acinar cell 
hyperplasia (0.65 g/kg/day), focal hypertrophy of the zona fasciculata in the adrenal cortex (0.65 
g/kg/day) and thyroid follicular cell hyperplasia (≥0.07 g/kg/day).   
In female rats, neoplastic changes were noted in the following tissues: pancreatic acinar cell adenomas 
(0.30 g/kg/day), pancreatic acinar cell carcinomas (0.90 g/kg/day), adrenal cortical carcinomas (0.90 
g/kg/day), thyroid follicular cell adenomas and carcinomas (0.90 g/kg/day), Zymbal’s gland 
carcinomas (0.90 g/kg/day), benign endometrial stromal polyps in the uterus (0.90 g/kg/day) and 
malignant schwannomas in the cervix (0.30 g/kg/day).  Pre-neoplastic findings in female rats were 
also observed as pancreatic acinar cell hyperplasia (0.90 g/kg/day), focal hypertrophy of the zona 
fasciculata in the adrenal cortex ((≥0.30 g/kg/day), thyroid follicular cell hyperplasia (≥0.10 
g/kg/day), cystic endometrial hyperplasia in the uterus (0.90 g/kg/day), increased hepatocellular 
basophilic foci (≥0.30 g/kg/day) and retinal atrophy in the eyes (0.90 g/kg/day). 
The applicant provided a detailed discussion of the neoplastic and pre-neoplastic findings observed in 
the rats.  In addition a Scientific Advisory Panel (SAP) was convened as organised by the MAH, in order 
to classify the risk associated with each tumour type for the study.  The following was concluded for 
each tumour type: 
Adrenal Cortical Lesions: The no tumour effect dose level was considered to be 0.070 g/kg/day in 
males and 0.3 g/kg/day in females.  The proliferative lesions of the adrenal cortex were nonspecific 
and can be one of the most common findings in endocrine tissues of aged rats.  It was acknowledged 
that previous rodent endocrine tumours seen with non-genotoxic compounds have not been relevant 
for humans.  
Pancreatic Lesions: The no tumour effect dose level was considered to be 0.070 g/kg/day in males and 
0.3 g/kg/day in females.  Pancreatic acinar cell proliferation appears to be unique in the rat (Dominick 
et al., 1990; Klaunig et al., 2003).  It is noted that acinar cell hyperplasia and adenoma are not 
precursors of acinar cell carcinomas in humans.  The panel highlight the presence of glycerol and 
butyrate may influence release of cholecystokinin (CCK), which is only mitogenic to rat pancreatic 
acinar cells, leading to their stimulation and progression from hyperplasia to carcinoma.   
Thyroid Lesions:  
The no tumour effect dose level was considered to be 0.21 g/kg/day in males and 0.3 g/kg/day in 
females.  It is noted that thyroid tumours lack relevance in humans (Alison et al., 1994; Cohen, 2004) 
- literature suggest that neoplasia of the thyroid gland has only been observed in humans following 
exposure to radiation, and not with any chemical.  This suggests no relevancy of this finding for human 
use.   
Uterine Lesions:  
Cystic endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial stromal polyps were observed with increased incidence 
in all GPB treated female groups.  These findings are commonly seen in aging female rats.  Uterine 
endometrial lesions in humans are mediated by estrogen stimulation and there is no evidence of 
stimulation of estrogenic activity with GPB in any species in the animal toxicology studies.  The 
presence of endometrial stromal polyps are also common in aging rats, formed possibly due to changes 
in uterine stromal remodeling that tends to occur in aging rats (Suckow et al. 2006). In addition, there

appears to be no direct histomorphic counterpart in humans to the rat endometrial stromal polyp. It is 
agreed that there is a case that a carcinogenic risk for humans would be limited.   
Zymbal’s Gland: Tumours of Zymbal’s gland are uncommon in rodents, and additionally there is no 
corresponding organ in humans so the risk for humans may not be relevant.   
Cervical Schwannoma: A non-dose-related increase in malignant schwannomas was observed in the 
cervix of mid-dose (0.3 g/kg) female rats.  The report reviewed by the SAP suggests that the 
morphology of the rodent neoplasms is not the same lesion as human schwannomas.  In these cases, 
such as in the reproductive tract, they may appear more like primitive mesenchymal tumours than the 
well-organised structures present in human (Wippold et al., 2007).  It is highlighted that there is no 
dose-response relationship seen in the rat carcinogenicity study, the incidence of cervical 
schwannomas is highest at 0.3 g/kg/day.   
Reproduction Toxicity  
Developmental toxicity has been examined in pregnant rats and rabbits in appropriately conducted GLP 
studies. 
A single study was conducted in male and female rats to determine any potential effect GPB (HPN-100) 
had on reproductive performance and fertility.  Animals were treated with GPB with dosing of up to 1.2 
g/kg/day.  In male rats, there appeared to be no effect of GPB on fertility, on the appearance of male 
reproductive organs, and on sperm motility and counts.  In females all oestrous cycling and mating 
and fertility parameters were unaffected by dosages of GPB as high as 1.2 g/kg/day.   
General toxicity signs were seen in both sexes, predominantly in increased liver weights, decreased 
weight gain and decreased motor activity. The NOAEL in both male and female rats for general toxicity 
signs was established as the low dose, 0.65 mg/kg/day, for reproductive performance this was at the 
mid dose of 0.9 mg/kg/day. These values are supported and allow for sufficient safety margins to the 
anticipated clinical dose.  In rats the applicant has conducted a definitive study in which pregnant rats 
were orally treated with up to 0.9 g/kg/day GPB once daily gestation days 7–17.  Maternal toxic levels 
were seen at the mid and high doses (0.65 and 0.9 g/kg/day) in which maternal weight gains were 
reduced.  This resulted in reduced fetal weights in these treatment groups (up to 10% loss in fetal 
weight compared to controls).  Fetuses in these dose groups also demonstrated increased incidences of 
skeletal variations and incomplete ossifications.  Based on these results, the developmental and 
maternal NOAELs of 0.3 g/kg/day (1.8 g/m2/day) are supported.   
In rabbits, in the definitive study pregnant rabbits were treated with up to 0.35 g/kg/day GPB once 
daily on gestation day 7 through day 19.  No developmental effects were observed at any dose in this 
study, there was no evidence of maternal adverse effects, nor were there any signs to indicate 
developmental toxicity.  There were no changes in fetal weight and no evidence of fetal gross external, 
visceral, or skeletal malformations or variations.  The maternal and developmental NOAEL is agreed as 
0.35 g/kg/day (4.2 g/m2/day).  In the earlier conducted dose range finding study in rabbits, adverse 
changes were observed at doses of 0.6 g/kg/day and mortality was observed at 0.4 g/kg/day, so there 
is some support that the dose of 0.35 g/kg/day may be a valid estimation for a NOAEL.  
There were limited adverse changes observed in the perinatal/postnatal toxicity study conducted in 
rats.  Pregnant rats were administered GPB at 0.3, 0.6, or 0.9 g/kg/day once daily by gavage to 
pregnant females from GD 7 through lactation day 20.  Similar adverse effect seen in the 
developmental toxicity study was observed at doses of 0.6 and 0.9 g/kg/day, although no changes 
were observed on pregnancy outcomes.  Effects on the F1 generation, i.e. sexual maturation, learning,

memory, and reproductive capacity were absent on all doses tested.  The maternal NOAEL for GPB was 
0.3 g/kg/day (1.8 g/m2/day) and the NOAEL for growth and viability of the F1 pups was 0.9 g/kg/day 
(5.4 g/m2/day). 
In summary, maternal toxicity and adverse effects on embryofoetal development (foetal weights and 
cervical ribs) were observed in the rat study. 
Overall, the risk for developmental toxicity as the result of treatment with GPB at clinical doses is 
considered to be limited, it is agreed that restrictions to not use RAVICTI during pregnancy and for use 
of contraception in women of childbearing potential is appropriate.  
Juvenile toxicity: 
Two studies were completed to examine the effects of GPB on neonatal/ juvenile animals.  
In the 13 week repeat dose study in juvenile cynomolgus monkeys  previously discussed , the toxicity 
profile in juvenile animals did not significantly differ from that establish with adult monkey studies with 
GPB.  
The neonatal rat studies were in two parts:  the first part of the study conducted from postnatal Day 2-
50 examined clinical signs of toxicity to the animals.  Rats were treated with up to 1.2 g/kg/day GPB, 
and the main findings were related to changes to liver markers (ALT and AST were increased in 
females), reduction in leucocyte counts, and lowered adrenal and ovarian weights.  Most of the 
adverse findings were observed in the high dose group animals, and so a NOAEL for general toxicity in 
neonatal rats is 0.9 g/kg/day (5.4 g/m2/day).  All treated animals however demonstrated microscopic 
findings of minimal to mild periductular mixed cellular infiltrates in the liver.  These findings were seen 
in earlier studies with GPB and may be considered to be an adaptive response. 
In the second part of this study, pre/post natal development was further examined in the F1 
generation of these neonatal rats.  Following treatment with GPB some changes were noted in the mid 
and high dose groups such as reductions in litter size and live foetuses in addition to gross external 
alterations (umbilical hernia and tail anomalies).  A NOAEL for developmental toxicity could not be 
determined as adverse fetal findings (loss of foetal weight) was observed in all treated groups, so a 
dose below 0.65 g/kg/day, similar to that seen in the earlier pre/post natal study in rats is most likely.   
In summary, the neonatal studies are sufficient to support the proposed paediatric dosing with GPB, 
toxicity profiles are not adversely different between neonatal and adult rats. 
Other toxicity studies 
No concerns were raised for local tolerance or immunotoxicity following review of the repeat dose 
toxicity studies. 
Impurities in the drug substance have been adequately qualified in toxicological studies, batch details 
have been provided in the dossier to support the argument for qualification.   
2.4.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An appended ERA report has been provided, detailing some of the pharmacokinetics of the active 
substance, glycerol phenylbutyrate, i.e. its active degradation in vivo to PAA and PBA, and the 
assessment of these components in the ERA as a result.   
The result of Phase I assessment reveals that PAA and PBA cannot be considered to be PBT’s, although 
the estimation for PEC surfacewater (3.345 µg/L) is above the action limit to trigger further

investigation in a Phase II environmental fate and effects assessment.  Further justification to support 
the endogenous formation of PAA in animals and humans was provided and the discussion was 
acceptable, further examination of glycerol phenylbutyrate (PAA/PBA) in a Phase II assessment was 
deemed unnecessary.  The use of glycerol phenylbutyrate, and generation of its metabolites, PBA and 
PAA, will not pose a risk to the environment. It is agreed that the use of glycerol phenylbutyrate, and 
generation of its metabolites, PBA and PAA will not pose a risk to the environment.

2.4.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The applicant has performed an adequate non-clinical development programme for GPB, which 
consisted of a range of safety pharmacology, pharmacokinetic (PK) and toxicology studies.  
Pharmacodynamic studies have not been conducted by the Applicant but literature and extensive 
clinical experience is available for PBA which is licensed in the EU in the form of sodium phenylbutyrate 
(NaPBA) for the treatment of urea cycle disorders.  
Toxicity studies were conducted in mice, rats and monkeys, including a full battery of genotoxicity, 
carcinogenicity and reproductive toxicity studies. The genotoxicity of the GPB metabolites PBA, PAA, 
PAGN, and phenylacetylglycine (PAG) was assessed in in vitro genotoxicity studies.  
The main toxicities observed during the non-clinical development were related to reduced body weight 
or body weight gain along with microscopic changes in the liver and spleen.  The latter toxicities were 
considered adaptive and secondary to metabolic alterations. Overall, the reviews of the general toxicity 
studies do not reveal any additional concerns in relation for safety for human administration. 
In the rat carcinogenicity study, a number of neoplasms were detected that can be attributed to 
treatment.  These include findings of tumours in the adrenal gland, pancreas, thyroid, uterus, Zymbal’s 
gland, and cervix.  The applicant has provided a detailed discussion of the neoplastic and pre-
neoplastic findings observed in the rats.  In addition a Scientific Advisory Panel (SAP) was convened in 
order to classify the risk associated with each tumour type.  
Assessment report

The applicant has addressed the concern raised for relevance of the tumour findings with greater 
emphasis attached to the use of historical control incidences and additional literature provided.  More 
in-depth discussions have been provided to explain the relevance of tumours observed in the adrenal 
gland, the pancreas, thyroid, uterus, Zymbal’s gland, and cervix.  Potential rat–specific mechanisms 
for tumour formation were also explored.  Overall, it is agreed that the relevance of lesions in the 
adrenal gland, pancreas, thyroid, uterus and Zymbal’s gland to humans would be limited.  It is also 
acknowledged that NaPBA (AMMONAPS), the precursor to the active PAA moiety has been on the 
market in the EU since 1996 without any significant finding for neoplastic lesions. There is also some 
limited literature evidence presented to suggest that exposure to PBA may demonstrate some modest 
improvement in different types of cancer.  Further discussion is provided concerning the increased 
incidence of schwannomas observed in the completed rat carcinogenicity study (Study WIL-671007).  
A non-dose-related increase in malignant schwannomas was observed in the cervix of mid-dose (8/65 
animals, 300 mg/kg) female rats, compared to incidences in the two female control groups (2/65 and 
0/65).  It is also highlighted that in humans, malignant schwannomas are thought to occur in patients 
with neurofibromatosis at an incidence of 2-13%.   
In summary, most of the Scientific Advisory Panel discussions are supported, including the limited 
human relevance for malignant cervical schwannomas. The non-clinical data have also been 
adequately reflected in the SmPC.   
Overall no concerns for genotoxicity were raised with GPB and its main metabolites in the completed in 
vitro and in vivo studies. Further examination of the completed long term studies in rats and the 6 
month transgenic mouse study reveals a lack of carcinogenic potential, and it is further confirmed that 
these rodent studies would have included adequate exposure to all relevant human metabolites.  Given 
the added discussion from the non-clinical studies and lack of malignancy signal observed following 
clinical exposure to NaPBA, this can be considered sufficiently addressed in the non-clinical part of the 
application. 
Toxicokinetic evaluations were included in all of the repeat dose toxicology studies, in each of the 
embryo-foetal toxicity study in rats and rabbits and also in the 2 year carcinogenicity study in rats.  
Exposure to GPB (PBA/PAA/PAG/PAGN) was confirmed in all dosed animals and exposure generally 
increased on increased dose.  There was limited gender variation in exposure and no evidence of 
accumulation. Overall the Applicant has provided an adequate toxicokinetic programme. 
In reprotoxicity studies, maternal toxicity was observed as all as reduced weight in foetuses and 
cervical ribs. This is adequately described in the SmPC.  
Overall, the risk for developmental toxicity as the result of treatment with GPB at clinical doses is 
considered to be limited, it is agreed that restrictions to not use RAVICTI during pregnancy and for use 
of contraception in women of childbearing potential is appropriate.  
Assessment of paediatric data on non-clinical aspects 
In addition, to support the use in paediatric patients the effects of GPB were assessed in juvenile 
toxicity studies in neonatal rats and juvenile monkeys.  This is adequately addressed.  
2.4.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
From a non-clinical point of view, the CHMP considered that the data have been adequately addressed 
and there are no non- clinical objections to the grant of a marketing authorisation.

2.5.  Clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
The rationale for clinical development of HPN-100 was to offer to UCD patients an alternative to NaPBA 
with sustained-release characteristics that would provide better nitrogen-scavenging and ammonia 
control, in a formulation that does not contain sodium or sugar, eliminates the substantial pill burden, 
as well as the bad taste and odour associated with NaPBA, which are reported to compromise 
compliance in many patients. 
The Clinical Development Program includes 10 controlled and uncontrolled clinical studies as 
summarized in Table 1 below. These studies were performed across three populations (UCD patients, 
hepatic impaired patients and healthy volunteers); collectively these studies comprise 359 
patients/subjects who have received at least one dose of Ravicti. The portion that comprises the target 
UCD population includes 114 patients with deficiencies in CPS, OTC, ASS, ASL, ARG, or HHH syndrome 
across five short- and long-term clinical studies (UP 1204-003, HPN-100-005, HPN-100-006, HPN-100-
007, HPN-100-012), as well as a continued access protocol (HPN-100-011), which is ongoing for six 
patients in Canada. The portion that comprises the hepatic impaired patient population includes 
129 patients from two studies (UP 1204-002, HPN-100-008) and the portion that comprises healthy 
volunteers includes 116 adults from two Phase 1 single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic 
(PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) studies (UP 1204-001, UP 1204-002) and a thorough QT/QTc study 
(HPN-100-010). 
The four short-term UCD studies compared 24-hour ammonia control during equivalent steady state 
dosing with HPN-100 and the approved comparator, NaPBA, in UCD patients ranging in age from two 
months to over 70 years. In addition, there were three 12-month open label studies.

2.5.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption 
Ravicti Glycerol phenylbutyrate (HPN-100) is a nitrogen-binding agent AND is a pro-drug of PBA.  HPN-
100 consists of three molecules of phenylbutyric acid (PBA) joined to glycerol by ester linkage to form 
a short-chain triglyceride, which appears to be digested by pancreatic lipases to release PBA (Studies 
Lowe 2009; A3091-11).  Because the synthesis of each molecule of glutamine requires two nitrogen 
molecules, the body excretes two nitrogen molecules with each molecule of phenylacetylglutamine 
(PAGN). This is the same stoichiometry as for urea, each molecule of which also contains two nitrogen

a This conversion likely involves more than one enzyme present in liver and kidney (Moldave 1957) 
Upon oral ingestion, PBA is released from the glycerol backbone in the gastrointestinal tract by 
pancreatic lipases. PBA derived from RAVICTI is further converted by β-oxidation to PAA. 
In healthy, fasting adult subjects receiving a single oral dose of 2.9 ml/m2 of RAVICTI, peak plasma 
levels of PBA, PAA, and PAGN occurred at 2 h, 4 h, and 4 h, respectively. Upon single-dose 
administration of RAVICTI, plasma concentrations of PBA were quantifiable in 15 of 22 participants at 
the first sample time post dose (0.25 h). Mean maximum concentration (Cmax) for PBA, PAA, and PAGN 
was 37.0 μg/ml, 14.9 μg/ml, and 30.2 μg/ml, respectively. In healthy subjects, intact glycerol 
phenylbutyrate was not detected in plasma.  
In healthy subjects, the systemic exposure to PAA, PBA, and PAGN increased in a dose dependent 
manner. Following 4 ml of RAVICTI for 3 days (3 times a day [TID]), mean Cmax and AUC were 66 
μg/ml and 930 μg•h/ml for PBA and 28 μg/ml and 942 μg•h/ml for PAA, respectively. In the same 
study, following 6 ml of RAVICTI for 3 days (TID), mean Cmax and AUC were 100μg/ml and 1400 
μg•h/ml for PBA and 65 μg/ml and 2064 μg•h/ml for PAA, respectively. 
In adult UCD patients receiving multiple doses of RAVICTI, maximum plasma concentrations at steady 
state (Cmaxss) of PBA, PAA, and PAGN occurred at 8 h, 12 h, and 10 h, respectively, after the first dose 
in the day. Intact glycerol phenylbutyrate was not detectable in plasma in UCD patients. 
Metabolism 
Overall, plasma concentrations of PBA and its metabolites in adults generally displayed less fluctuation 
following HPN-100 as compared to NaPBA treatment. (see further information in the target population 
later in the report). 
In studies involving a comparison of TID dosing with HPN-100 versus NaPBA, the fluctuation between 
minimum and maximum metabolite levels in plasma (Cmin-ss versus Cmax-ss and decreasing again to 
Cmin-ss) was less pronounced in adult patients with UCDs after dosing TID with HPN-100 than with 
NaPBA.  
Assessment report

These differences in plasma fluctuation are consistent with the conclusion that in adults, PBA delivered 
as HPN-100 is absorbed more slowly from the gastrointestinal tract than when delivered as NaPBA, 
presumably reflecting the time required for digestion of HPN-100 by pancreatic lipases. Slower 
absorption of PBA results in more sustained levels of the active downstream metabolites, PAA and 
PAGN. The results suggest further that despite differences in plasma metabolite levels with HPN-100 
and NaPBA, the extent of PBA absorption as measured by U-PAGN is very similar for the two drugs. 
This disparity in plasma level and U-PAGN likely reflects the fact that PBA undergoes variable fractional 
conversion to PAA and PAGN during first-pass metabolism and prior to reaching the systemic 
circulation. 
Food effect 
The study results suggest that food intake may slightly reduce the absorption of HPN-100 but this may 
also reflect faster metabolism due to the presence of increased nitrogen levels following food. 
However, in the clinical development programme, HPN-100 has been administered with meals in each 
of the clinical trials and is expected to be administered with meals in clinical practice to mitigate post-
prandial ammonia production. This approach is based on the rationale that it is the formation of PAGN 
from PAA and the amino acid glutamine that constitutes the nitrogen-scavenging step and the 
excretion of PAGN in urine that mediates waste nitrogen removal. As the effects of food intake shown 
in these studies appear to be small it is unlikely to be clinically significant. 
Distribution 
The binding was dependent on concentration for PBA and PAA, as shown by the higher levels of free 
fraction with increasing concentrations over the ranges investigated. This has an impact on the 
assessment of linearity of pharmacokinetics. 
Elimination  
Excretion of PAGN rids the body of waste nitrogen that UCD patients who genetically are unable to 
excrete in the form of urea.  Elimination pathways are similar to that of NaPBA. However it is noted 
that only 70% of the administered drug is accounted for.   
Dose proportionality and dose dependency 
The non-linearity in the pharmacokinetics of PAA and the decreased protein binding with time suggests 
that dose escalations should be performed with caution.  Multiple dose studies in healthy volunteers 
used a different dose regimen from that proposed in the clinical. However the profiles provided in 
patients and from the population analysis there does not appear to be any unexpected changes in the 
pharmacokinetics with time. 
 Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Pharmacokinetics of RAVICTI in Adult Patients  
•  Study UP 1204-003 
Absorption/exposure 
In Study UP 1204-003, when HPN-100 was administered to adults with UCD, the systemic exposure 
(AUC0-24) of PBA was 27% lower than that observed with NaPBA (540 versus 739 μg∙h/mL, 
Assessment report  
EMA/676925/2015  
Page 33/89 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
respectively), whereas exposure levels of PAA (575 versus 596 μg∙h/mL, respectively) and PAGN (1098 
versus 1133 μg∙h/mL, respectively) were very similar.  
Mean peak (Cmax-ss) plasma concentrations of PAA following HPN-100 therapy were 23.5% lower than 
those observed with NaPBA (i.e., 40.5 and 53.0 μg/mL, respectively), and minimum plasma 
concentrations (Cmin-ss) of PAA following HPN-100 therapy were approximately 2-fold higher than those 
observed with NaPBA (i.e., 7.06 versus. 3.56 μg/mL).  
Overall, in Study UP 1204-003 plasma concentrations of PAA following HPN-100 treatment displayed a 
lower fluctuation between peak and trough as compared to the NaPBA formulation. The mean % 
fluctuation in PBA concentrations following NaPBA was around 61% higher than that observed after 
HPN-100 therapy. For PAA, mean % fluctuation in PAA concentrations was around 13% higher 
following NaPBA as compared to HPN-100 therapy (956% versus 843%, respectively). The mean 
fluctuation in PAGN concentrations was around 17% lower following NaPBA as compared to HPN-100 
therapy (952% versus 1145%, respectively).  
All PK parameters of PAA were associated with very high inter-patient variability. This variability is in 
part due to the range of doses of NaPBA and HPN-100 (7 to 18 g equivalent PBA) that were 
administered in this study and reflects as well inter-individual differences in PAA to PAGN conversion 
rate. The U-PAGN0-24 following HPN-100 treatments was slightly lower (11% lower) than that 
observed for NaPBA. 
•  Study HPN-100-006 
In Study HPN-100-006, mean systemic exposure of plasma PBA was also lower (15%) after HPN-100 
compared with NaPBA treatment (433 versus 508 μg∙h/mL, respectively), but the decrease was not 
significant. Mean systemic exposure to PAA was significantly lower, by approximately 25%, for HPN-
100 versus NaPBA (447 versus 599 μg∙h/mL), as was the mean PAA Cmax-ss (38.5 versus 52.2 μg/mL). 
The highest individual PAA level in any patient during HPN-100 or NaPBA treatment was 178 and 213 
μg/mL, respectively, well below the levels reported by Thibault (1994; 1995) to be associated with 
toxicity (499–1285 μg/mL). 
The mean % fluctuation in PBA concentrations in plasma following NaPBA was around 38% higher than 
that observed after HPN-100 therapy. Mean % fluctuation in PAA concentrations was around 57% 
higher following NaPBA as compared to HPN-100 therapy (2150% versus 1368%, respectively). For 
PAGN, mean fluctuation in PAGN concentrations was around 63% higher following NaPBA as compared 
to HPN-100 therapy (1434% versus 881%, respectively). Overall, plasma concentrations of PBA and its 
metabolites generally displayed less fluctuation following the administration of HPN-100 as compared 
to NaPBA treatment. 
In conclusion, the systemic exposure of PAGN following HPN-100 and NaPBA treatments among adult 
patients in Study UP 1204-003 (1098 and 1133 μg∙h/mL, respectively) were very similar to HPN-100-
006 values (1127 and 1252 μg∙h/mL). In addition, the U PAGN0-24 for patients on HPN-100 treatment 
was essentially identical to that of patients on NaPBA (mean excretion = 13.50 and 13.62 g, 
respectively). Based on results from the ANOVA, the geometric least-squares mean ratio for Ae was 
101% and that for Fe was 97.7%, with the 90% confidence intervals around the least-squares mean 
ratios for both parameters completely contained within the 80–125% interval.  
Although treatment with HPN-100 resulted in significantly lower systemic exposure when compared 
with that of PAA and PAGN than NaPBA and thus is considered not bioequivalent in plasma, it was 
bioequivalent to NaPBA in terms of U-PAGN, which represents the extent of absorption of PBA. While 
the total PAGN excretion was essentially the same for both drugs, less PAGN was excreted in urine

during the 12–24-h (overnight) period than during the 0–12-h period following NaPBA treatment while 
excretion of PAGN in urine was more evenly distributed over 24 h after treatment with HPN-100 
(Figure 2.7.2-8). 
Collectively, these findings indicate that in adults, PBA delivered in the form of HPN-100 is absorbed 
more slowly from the gastrointestinal tract when compared to NaPBA, presumably reflecting the time 
required for conversion of HPN-100 to PBA by intestinal lipases and possibly greater amount of 
conversion of PBA to PAA and PAGN before it reaches the systemic circulation. Slower absorption of 
PBA into the circulation results in more sustained levels of the active downstream metabolites PAA and 
PAGN.  
Pharmacokinetics of RAVICTI in Paediatric Patients 
•  Study HPN-100-005 
In paediatric study HPN-100-005, the exposure (AUC0-24 and Cmax-ss) of the metabolites PBA, PAA, and 
PAGN in plasma was not significantly greater in paediatric patients (6–17 years of age) after dosing 
with HPN-100 compared to NaPBA.  The results are contrary to those observed after dosing in adult 
patients, who demonstrated greater exposure of these metabolites after dosing with NaPBA versus 
HPN-100. In addition, exposure of PAA in paediatric patients was greater than that observed in adults 
after dosing with both treatments. However, the differences between PAA levels during dosing with 
NaPBA and HPN-100 were small relative to the inter-patient variability observed.  
Comparative PAA exposure among paediatric patients during dosing with HPN-100 and NaPBA was 
further explored by Pop PK modeling and dosing simulations. In brief, the results of these analyses, 
along with the non-compartmental PK analyses in UCD patients ages 2 months through 5 years, 
indicate that PAA exposure is very similar during dosing of paediatric patients with NaPBA and HPN-
100 and that the rate of conversion of PBA to PAA varies directly with BSA, a finding which explains the 
generally higher PAA levels among 
•  Study HPN-100-012 
In paediatric study HPN-100-012 the mean systemic exposure (AUC0-24) during dosing with HPN-100 
and NaPBA was generally similar for the two drugs for PBA (255 vs. 483 μg•h/mL, respectively), PAA 
(1096 vs. 1458 μg•h/mL, respectively) and PAGN (1130 vs. 946 μg•h/mL, respectively), both among 
all patients and among the age subgroups (< 2 years and 2 to < 6 years).  
The concentration of urinary PAGN, as well as the ratio of the concentrations of urinary PAGN to 
urinary creatinine, which corrects for any drug-related differences in urine volume, was higher during 
treatment with HPN-100 than with NaPBA and exhibited less variability. 
Since patients received a wide range of HPN-100 doses, which corresponded to the PBA equivalent of 
their prescribed doses of NaPBA ranging from 0.7 g to 8 g, total systemic exposure (AUC0-24) and 
maximum concentration (Cmax) varied widely. Many samples, primarily fasting samples, had 
undetectable PBA or PAA; up to 75% for PBA and 46% for PAA after NaPBA treatment with fewer 
concentrations below the limit of quantitation (LOQ) after HPN-100 treatment. PAGN was measurable 
in nearly all samples. Even patients with the highest PBA and PAA levels had plasma samples with non-
measurable or very low PBA and PAA levels, indicating a  lack of accumulation of these metabolites in 
this population. The observed variability in plasma metabolites levels can be explained by high 
fluctuation index (calculated as a percentage as the difference between minimum plasma concentration 
(Cmin) and Cmax divided by Cmin x 100), the wide range of doses administered and the wide range of 
ages and body size in the study population.  
Assessment report  
EMA/676925/2015

Patients under two years of age showed higher overall PAA exposure as reflected by higher AUC0-24 and 
Cmax levels after treatment with both drugs as compared with older children. As with paediatric patients 
ages 6 through 17, the data among this group exhibited considerable variability. Of four patients in 
this age category, two patients showed similar patterns to the older children ages two to under six. 
However, two patients with the highest PAA values on NaPBA or HPN-100 were both under two years 
of age. The highest PAA value was seen in Patient 05-1209, a two month old ASS female receiving 
2.728 g of PBA (8.28 g/m2) in the form of NaPBA treatment. Due to difficulty obtaining venous access 
on Day 10, PK parameters could not be calculated for this patient after HPN-100 treatment. However, 
the one blood sample drawn on HPN-100 at the 24-hr time point showed lower PAA levels than the 
corresponding 24-hr value on NaPBA treatment. In one male patient of one year old with ASS 
deficiency the highest PAA values after HPN-100 with overall higher AUC0-24 and Cmax on HPN-100 were 
observed. He received 7.344 g (13.11 g/m2) of PBA as HPN-100 (the PBA equivalent of the maximum 
labelled dose for NaPBA). 
Pharmacokinetic Comparisons between Adult and Paediatric UCD Patients 
The metabolite exposure after either NaPBA or HPN-100 across age groups shows high levels of 
variability and high fluctuation indices. The mean exposure to PBA, the parent metabolite, and mean 
exposure to PAGN, the terminal metabolite, show no systematic variation across age groups, while PAA 
exposure tended to decrease with increasing age, a finding consistent with those from population PK 
modeling which indicate that the rate of clearance/metabolism of PAA varies directly with body size. 
While, systemic metabolite exposure, assessed as Cmax or AUC, is generally similar for HPN-100 and 
NaPBA, the minimum concentration (Cmin-ss) is generally higher for all metabolites in all age groups 
during HPN-100 treatment, a finding consistent with slower gastrointestinal absorption of PBA when 
administered orally as HPN-100.  
In all studies involving a comparison of TID dosing with HPN-100 versus NaPBA, the fluctuation 
between minimum and maximum metabolite levels in plasma (Cmin-ss versus Cmax-ss and decreasing 
again to Cmin-ss) was less pronounced in patients with UCDs after dosing TID with HPN-100 than with 
NaPBA. These results are consistent with slower input of PBA into the systemic circulation when 
delivered orally as HPN-100 versus NaPBA. Despite differences in plasma metabolite levels with HPN-
100 and NaPBA, the extent of PBA absorption as measured by U-PAGN excretion is very similar for the 
two drugs, which likely reflects the fact that PBA undergoes variable fractional conversion to PAA and 
PAGN during first-pass metabolism and prior to reaching the systemic circulation. 
Overall, the results from these studies demonstrated that HPN-100 is equivalent to NaPBA in terms of 
waste nitrogen scavenging, as reflected by the nearly identical urinary output of PAGN during 
treatment with the two drugs. The findings further suggest that the extent of PBA absorption is similar 
when given orally as HPN-100 versus NaPBA, based on similar U-PAGN output, but that the rate of PBA 
absorption is slower when given as HPN-100 versus NaPBA, based on lesser % fluctuation in plasma 
metabolite levels and more evenly spaced day–night output of U-PAGN with HPN-100 dosing. Finally, 
the results suggest that variable presystemic conversion of PBA to PAA and subsequently to PAGN 
explains the considerable variability during dosing with both drugs in the levels of plasma metabolites, 
particularly PBA, despite very similar output of U-PAGN. Because U- PAGN is an important marker of 
the pharmacologic ammonia-trapping properties of HPN-100 and NaPBA, whereas plasma 
concentrations of the metabolites are not, it follows that U-PAGN is a more useful biomarker for 
assessing compliance and dosing. 
The Pop PK modeling corroborates with, and strengthens the principal conclusions drawn from the PK 
analyses from these individual UCD studies, including a similar extent but slower rate of PBA 
absorption when given orally as HPN-100 versus NaPBA and variable presystemic conversion of PBA to

PAA and PAGN during dosing with both drugs. The modelling and simulations also confirm the lower 
PAA values in adults during dosing with HPN-100 as compared with NaPBA, predict very similar PAA 
values for the two drugs in paediatric patients, and provide additional information relevant to proposed 
dosing based on PAA and U-PAGN.  
Pharmacokinetics interaction studies 
Drug–drug interaction is not expected for concomitantly administered drugs that are not themselves 
P450 substrates, such as dietary supplements commonly taken by UCD patients including arginine or 
citrulline. Because HPN-100 and its metabolites do not induce P450 enzymes, administration of HPN-
100 is unlikely to attenuate the effect of concomitantly administered drugs that are substrates for P450 
enzymes. However, because PBA and PAA do inhibit CYP enzymes, an exaggerated drug effect is 
theoretically possible for concomitantly administered drugs that are also P450 substrates. Therefore an 
in vivo drug interaction study to evaluate the effect of HPN-100 on the PK of a drug that is sensitive 
substrate of CYP3A4/5 (e.g., midazolam) was initiated in study HPN-100-019.   
Study HPN-100-019 was open-label, monosequence crossover, drug-drug interaction study of RAVICTI 
and midazolam in 24 healthy male and female subjects.  
All subjects received all treatments in a sequential order. Subjects received a single oral dose of 3 mg 
midazolam liquid on the morning of Day 1 following an approximate 10-hour fast and just prior to 
administration of breakfast. Subjects received oral doses of 4.4 g RAVICTI as a liquid 3 times a day on 
Days 2 to 5, doses were administered just prior to a standard meal with the first dose of each day 
following an approximate 10 hour fast from food. On Day 5, a single oral dose of 3 mg midazolam was 
coadministered with the morning dose of RAVICTI.  
Blood samples for analysis of plasma concentrations of midazolam and its metabolite, 1’ OH 
midazolam, were collected on Days 1 and 5, for 24 hours postdose.  
The results of the HPN-100-019 study indicate that exposure to RAVICTI results in decreased systemic 
exposure to midazolam and increased exposure to the 1-hydroxy metabolite of midazolam which is 
consistent with an induction of CYP3A4 enzyme.  
These findings are contrary to those anticipated based on the in vitro studies, which demonstrated 
significant inhibition of CYP3A4 by PBA and PAA and, instead, suggest that steady state dosing of 
RAVICTI results in mild CYP3A4 induction. Specifically, as compared with systemic midazolam exposure 
prior to HPN-100 dosing, analyses following HPN-100 dosing indicated decreased exposure to intact 
midazolam as well as the increased exposure to its hydroxy metabolite (Table 2).

Induction of CYP3A4, which catalyzes the hydroxylation of midazolam, would explain both the 
decreased exposure to intact midazolam as well as the increased exposure to its metabolite. In 
general, physicians prescribing RAVICTI along with any of the drugs would need to be alert to the 
possibility of accelerated metabolism and decreased drug effect. Among the possible pharmacological 
agents, only proton pump inhibitors, known to have a wide therapeutic margin, were used among 
greater than 10% of patients in the RAVICTI clinical trials. 
While CYP3A4 is involved in the metabolism of a substantial fraction of currently used pharmacological 
agents, drug–drug interaction is not expected for concomitantly administered drugs that are not 
themselves CYP substrates, such as the dietary supplements arginine or citrulline. However, it is 
possible that HPN-100 and its metabolites may induce CYP enzymes and therefore attenuate the effect 
of concomitantly administered drugs that are substrates for CYP enzymes. This is adequately described 
in the SmPC. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Ravicti (HPN-100) is a prodrug of PBA and shares the same mechanism of action and metabolic 
pathway as NaPBA approved by the European Medicines Agency [EMA] as AMMONAPS® in 1999 but 
differ in terms of absence of sodium. It is hydrolyzed to glycerol and PBA in the gastrointestinal tract 
via pancreatic lipases. Because hydrolysis presumably only begins after HPN-100 exits the stomach 
and enters the proximal small intestine where it is exposed to pancreatic lipases, PBA delivered orally 
as HPN-100 enters the circulation about 75% more slowly than when delivered orally as NaPBA. Intact 
HPN-100 is not detected in the circulation of animals or humans.  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
PBA is converted via β-oxidation to phenylacetic acid (PAA), which is conjugated enzymatically with 
glutamine to form phenylacetylglutamine (PAGN), which is excreted in the urine and thereby mediates 
excretion of waste nitrogen ( Moldave, 1957). Because glutamine contains two nitrogen atoms, 
excretion of one mol of PAGN results in removal of two moles of nitrogen, the same as when urea is 
excreted in urine. Not only does glutamine participate in this alternative pathway for elimination of 
waste nitrogen, but glutamine levels correlate with plasma ammonia levels and symptoms in UCD 
patients, and its intracellular accumulation in glial cells is believed to mediate cerebral oedema 
(Butterworth, 2009; Maestri, 1992; Tuchman, 2008). 
Blood ammonia was the pharmacodynamics efficacy surrogate in each of the short term studies 
evaluating 24-hour AUC of ammonia concentration between RAVICTI and sodium phenylbutyrate at 
steady state. In the combined pooled analysis of these short-term studies, ammonia AUC0-24 h was

774.11 and 991.19 [(µmol/L)*hour] during treatment with RAVICTI and sodium phenylbutyrate, 
respectively (n = 80, ratio of geometric means 0.84; 95% confidence intervals 0.740, 0.949). 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Ravicti (HPN-100) is a prodrug of PBA and shares the same mechanism of action and metabolic 
pathway as NaPBA. It is hydrolyzed to glycerol and PBA in the gastrointestinal tract via pancreatic 
lipases. Because hydrolysis presumably only begins after HPN-100 exits the stomach and enters the 
proximal small intestine where it is exposed to pancreatic lipases, PBA delivered orally as HPN-100 
enters the circulation about 75% more slowly than when delivered orally as NaPBA. Intact HPN-100 is 
not detected in the circulation of animals or humans. 
Although no formal studies have been performed, the pharmacodynamics of this class of compounds 
(HPN-100 & NaPBA) is well known. PBA is converted via β-oxidation to its active metabolite PAA 
(Kormanic, 2012), which is conjugated with glutamine to form phenylacetylglutamine (PAGN), which 
mediates waste nitrogen removal through urinary excretion.  
The compound, although it largely shares the same mechanism of action as sodium phenylbutyrate 
(NaPBA) AMMONAPS®, differ in terms of absence of sodium.  Its PK programme has been limited to 
only one or two formal studies. However, in consideration of the shared structural features with a 
known compound (NaPBA) and taking into account the nature of the disease condition, this is 
considered to be overall acceptable.  
The observed reduction in blood ammonia is consistent with the expected therapeutic effects of the 
two compounds. The blood ammonia levels and urinary PAGN are therefore important determinants of 
treatment outcomes and reflect the patients’ clinical response to RAVICTI, although the correlation 
between determinants and clinical outcomes does not appear to have been fully investigated in this 
case.  
Overall, the plasma concentration–time profiles of HPN-100 and NaPBA are comparable in terms of the 
extent of exposure. However it is acknowledged that due to sustained release characteristics ofRavicti  
a better removal of waste nitrogen throughout the day is observed.   
A relevant interaction with the concomitant food has been found to slightly reduce the absorption of 
HPN-100. The mechanism of has not been elucidated. However, in the clinical development 
programme, HPN-100 has been administered with meals in each of the clinical trials and is expected to 
be administered with meals in clinical practice to mitigate post-prandial ammonia production. As the 
effects of food intake shown in these studies appear to be small it is unlikely to be clinically significant 
although the company has not appeared to have explored whether the chosen approach is completely 
without any detrimental effect. 
The applicant has submitted only one formal interaction study.  Based on this and other findings 
including population PK, the potential for any interaction with other compounds appears to be relatively 
small. Nevertheless the mode of action of the compound could theoretically influence the absorption of 
other medicinal products administered concomitantly. This aspect has been adequately described in the 
SmPC.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Despite some limitations due to the limited studies submitted, the CHMP considered the clinical 
pharmacology has been sufficiently investigated, taking into account the data available and the

knowledge of the already authorised as Ammonaps with which Ravicti shares the same mechanism of

2.6.  Clinical efficacy 
The applicant had previously received CHMP advice regarding the efficacy and safety evaluation 
measures contained in the development programme and this programme was found to be suitable for 
such an evaluation, and in accordance with the relevant CHMP guidelines in operation at the time. 
2.6.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
No  formal  dose  ranging  study  has  been  performed  or  reported  in  the  literature  regarding  the  use  of 
glycerol phenylbutyrate in patients with urea cycle disorders. Considering the prevalence and rarity of 
the  disease  condition  the  absence  of  formal  dose  finding  studies can  be  considered  acceptable  based 
on the discussion below. 
The selection of RAVICTI (HPN-100) treatment dose was empirically derived based on the current 
sodium phenylbutyrate (NaPBA) SmPC dosing recommendations which in turn are based on the weight 
of the UCD patient.  RAVICTI (HPN-100) dosing regimen in Clinical Trials is summarised in Table 2 
below.

Rationale for Dosing Based on Body Surface Area:  
The current NaPBA SmPC recommends that dosing be based on weight for UCD patients weighing less 
than 20 kg (which corresponds to approximately 6 years of age) and on Body Surface area (BSA) for 
patients weighing 20 kg or above. Based on normal weight and height growth charts, BSA calculated 
using Mosteller’s formula decreases in proportion to weight as children grow, such that dosing based 
on BSA relative to dosing based on weight ranges from approximately 20% greater at 2 months of age 
to approximately equal at 1 year to approximately 17% less at age 6, for which the normal (50 
percentile) weight is approximately 20-kg.  
Dosing in UCD patients must be individualized based on a variety of factors including UCD subtype, 
growth requirements, dietary protein intake, and the severity of that patient’s urea synthetic defect 
(which varies even for patients with the same subtype). The proposed dose range for HPN-100 (4.5 
mL/m2 to 11.2 mL/m2) based on BSA covers these variations in younger children.  
Assessment report  
EMA/676925/2015  
Page 40/89 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The applicant BSA-based dosing of all ages down to 2 months is further supported by:  
(a) the similarity of observed dosing normalized by BSA across paediatric (age groups <2, 2-5, 6-11 
and 12-17 years old) and adult UCD patients enrolled in the clinical studies, 
 (b) the similarity of projected PAA levels based on simulated dosing at the upper end of the proposed 
maximum range for HPN-100 versus NaPBA and (c) the avoidance of an abrupt and ‘artificial’ 15-20% 
decrease in dose as patients reach 20 kg in weight and are transitioned from dosing based on weight 
to dosing based on BSA. 
Rationale for Starting Dose:  
To achieve satisfactory ammonia control as quickly as possible, it is important to recommend having a 
starting dose and not only a dose range. The proposed starting dose for HPN-100 corresponds to the 
median dose (rounded) used among the 100 UCD patients in the pooled safety analysis; i.e., 7.8 g/m2 
for adult patients, 7.9 g/m2 for paediatric patients with a BSA of ≥ 1.3 m2, and 9.6 g/m2 for paediatric 
patients with a BSA of ≤ 1.3.  
It is understood that this is a guideline and that individual patient considerations will be required. This 
needs to be clearly mentioned in the SmPC.  
For example, patients being switched from NaPBA to HPN-100 would ordinarily be switched to the PBA 
equivalent dose, just as in the clinical trials. For patients initiating therapy, the dose of HPN-100 would 
be expected to be somewhat lower among adult heterozygous females with presumed significant 
residual urea synthetic capacity and potentially higher for patients with  neonatal-onset disease, which 
generally corresponds to little or no residual synthetic capacity. 
Rationale for Upper End of the Dose Range  
The upper end of the proposed HPN-100 dose range is 12.4 g/m2. This is the PBA equivalent of the 
upper end of the currently approved dose range for NaPBA. 
The projected PAA exposure, assessed either as Cmax or AUC0-24 with dosing of HPN-100 at the upper 
end of the maximum range (12.4 g/m2/day), is generally similar to the highest levels observed among 
paediatric and adult patients in the applicant clinical trials and similar for HPN-100 and NaPBA.  
Of importance, fewer than 5% of patients would be expected to be exposed to Cmax values above 500 
μg/mL that could theoretically be associated with reversible neurological AE. Moreover, analysis of data 
showed no relationship between PAA Cmax and neurological AEs among the 80 patients who 
participated in short-term controlled studies (UP 1204-003, the switch-over part of HPN-100-005 and 
HPN-100–012, and HPN-100-006). 
Rationale for Lower End of the Dose Range:  
The lower end of the proposed range (5mg/m2/day) is less than that currently recommended for 
NaPBA, however this is not based on any difference in behaviour between the two drugs.  
Rather, it is based upon a more complete understanding of the UCD clinical spectrum than was 
available at the time of NaPBA approval in 1996 and on the recognition that UCD patients with residual 
urea synthetic capacity who may benefit from therapy, would need less drug than patients with no 
Assessment report  
EMA/676925/2015  
Page 41/89 
 
 
 
 
 
residual capacity, which was by and large the population that Brusilow studied when formulating his 
dosing recommendations.  
The proposed range is also based on the observed NaPBA dose range in clinical practice and, in fact, 
reflects the actual HPN-100 dose range employed among the UCD patients in the applicant studies, 
with exclusion of the lowest 25th percentile whose data were analysed for purposes of dosing in the 
Pop PK modelling. The proposed minimum dose for HPN-100 corresponds to the 25th percentile dose 
used among the adult UCD patients in the clinical trials (i.e., 5.32 g/m2) and is very similar to that for 
all patients (5.31 g/m2).   
Rationale for Dose Adjustment and Monitoring 
The recommendations for dose adjustment in the SmPC propose three approaches to therapeutic 
monitoring. One utilizes plasma ammonia, a mainstay for clinical management of UCD patients; one 
utilizes U-PAGN as a direct measure for waste nitrogen excretion and the last one utilizes plasma PAA 
levels and/or plasma PAA:PAGN ratio for assessment of potential toxicity when symptoms of vomiting, 
nausea, headache with somnolence, confusion or sleepiness are present in the absence of high 
ammonia. This is acceptable and adequately addressed in the SmPC.  
2.6.2.  Main studies 
The clinical trials aimed at the demonstration of efficacy and safety as the primary objective are 
summarised in Table 3 below:  These summaries should be read in conjunction with the discussion on 
clinical efficacy as well as the benefit risk assessment (see later sections). 
The clinical development programme comprised 6 of 7 UCD subtypes for which approval is sought.

The comparative clinical efficacy of RAVICTI and sodium phenylbutyrate (NaPBA) was evaluated in 54 
adult and 26 paediatric UCD patients who completed one of four short-term studies.  
HPN-100-006 is considered to be the pivotal Phase 3 study in adults; HPN-100-005 and HPN-100-012, 
both a Phase 2 paediatric study; and UP 1204-003, a Phase 2 study in adults are all supportive.  
Methods 
HPN 100-006 was a Randomized, double-blind, crossover study to assess safety or efficacy of HPN-100 
in adult patients with UCD. 
Study Participants  
Adult patients with UCD 
Treatments / Choice of Control Treatment 
Placebo control was not feasible as any interruption of medication in patients with UCDs could lead to 
hyperammonaemic crisis and irreversible neurologic sequelae or death. Therefore, NaPBA was selected 
as the active-control in all studies. 
Assessment report  
EMA/676925/2015

NaPBA was administered orally three times daily (TID), with meals, as a 500-mg tablet (via mouth). 
Delivery via nasogastric or gastrostomy tube (G-tube) was permitted for patients who were unable to 
swallow. Patients who could not comply with taking NaPBA tablets were permitted to take NaPBA 
powder upon sponsor approval. 
Objectives/ Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
Blood ammonia, assessed as AUC0-24 at the end of each treatment period (Days 14 and 28), i.e., 
during steady-state dosing with HPN-100 or NaPBA, was selected as the primary efficacy endpoint in 
the pivotal efficacy study, HPN-100-006.  
Secondary Endpoints 
Maximum ammonia values observed on HPN-100 versus NaPBA, Rate (percentage) of ammonia values 
above the upper limit of normal (ULN) on HPN-100 versus NaPBA, Number and severity of 
symptomatic hyperammonaemic crises, Correlation between urinary PAGN (U-PAGN) excreted over 24 
hours (U-PAGN0-24) and blood ammonia AUC0-24, PK parameters including Cmax for major urinary and 
plasma metabolites (PAA, PBA, and PAGN), Urinary PAA, PBA, PAGN levels 
Post hoc efficacy analyses included the following:  
Correlation of total dose administered with urine and plasma metabolites, Plasma ammonia AUC0-24 
and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) by age at UCD onset (< 2 or ≥ 2 years of age), Glutamine 
levels on HPN-100 versus NaPBA. 
Assessment of blood ammonia is central to the evaluation of efficacy and safety in UCDs, as it is the 
signature biochemical abnormality common to these disorders and believed to be a surrogate for 
outcomes.  Control of blood ammonia is a primary objective of clinical management, and blood 
ammonia levels have been shown to correlate with clinical outcome.  
The outcome of the CHMP & COMP Protocol Assistance was that this was regarded as a surrogate 
parameter; however; long term ammonia control has been clearly demonstrated in both the short term 
and long term studies. The timing of the ammonia measurements for measurement of AUC of blood 
ammonia was discussed and the overall analytical approach to assessing efficacy based on blood 
ammonia was agreed upon in the context of the Scientific Protocol Assistance. In the Phase 2 
supportive efficacy studies, blood ammonia AUC0-24 on Day 7 and Day 14 was evaluated by post hoc 
efficacy analysis in adult UCD patients in UP 1204-003 and was pre-specified as an efficacy endpoint in 
paediatric UCD patients in HPN-100-005 and HPN-100-012.  
Statistical methods 
An ANOVA model for the natural log-transformed blood ammonia AUC0-24 was used to evaluate the 
non-inferiority of HPN-100 to NaPBA in controlling blood ammonia (as AUC0-24) in the intent-to-treat 
(ITT) population. The 95% CIs of the treatment difference between the least squares mean (LSMs) 
(HPN-100 minus NaPBA) on the natural log scale were used to evaluate non-inferiority in the individual 
studies and after pooling the data across the three studies. Non-inferiority was concluded when the 
upper bound of the 95% CI was ≤ 1.25. Superiority was concluded when the upper bound of the 95% 
CI was < 1.0.

In Study HPN-100-006, the Hochberg procedure was employed to control the overall type I error rate 
(Hochberg, 1988) for the secondary efficacy analyses. No adjustments for multiple comparisons were 
made in UP 1204-003, HPN-100-005 or HPN-100-012. 
In HPN-100-006 and HPN-100-005 missing ammonia data were imputed for patients who did not have 
a calculable blood ammonia AUC0-24 (< 12 h of ammonia data or patients missing both time 0 and 24 h 
values), or if the time 0 or time 24 h values were missing. In fact, very few ammonia samples were 
missed in either study, and little or no imputation was required. In HPN-100-012 each potential AUC 
was classified as either “incalculable” or “calculable”. An AUC was calculable if both 0 and 24 hr time 
points and at least one other time point (8 or 12 hr) was available; otherwise it was deemed as 
“incalculable” and no imputation of missing data was planned in the study. In UP 1204-003, missing 
data were imputed using the last-observation-carried-forward method for patients who had at least 
one blood ammonia 24 h AUC value after HPN-100 dosing 
In Study HPN-100-006, the Hochberg procedure was employed to control the overall type I error rate 
(Hochberg, 1988) for the secondary efficacy analyses. No adjustments for multiple comparisons were 
made in UP 1204-003, HPN-100-005 or HPN-100-012. 
Handling of Missing Data:  
From the sequence of ammonia level concentrations, the AUC0-24 was calculated. However, if the 
ammonia level for any of the time points was missing, the calculation of the AUC0-24 was affected.  
Each potential AUC was classified as either “incalculable” or “calculable.” An AUC was “incalculable” if 
either of the following conditions applied to the ammonia level data: Both measurements from predose 
and 24 hours were missing. 
The sampling interval was < 12 hours, e.g., the last available measurement was collected before the 
nominal 12-hour time point. 
An AUC was “calculable” if neither of the above two conditions were met. 
If a patient had both the AUC0-24 for HPN-100 and NaPBA as “incalculable,” then the patient was 
excluded from the analysis, e.g., AUC data were not imputed and AUC values were set to missing for 
both HPN-100 and NaPBA. 
If an AUC was “calculable” but with some missing measurements, the following imputation was 
applied: 
If either (not both) the predose or the 24-hour assessment was missing, then the predose or 24-hour 
assessment was imputed using the 24-hour and predose assessment, respectively. The nominal times 
of 0 hour and 24 hours were used for the imputed values of predose and 24-hour measurements, 
respectively. 
No imputation was applied to missing measurements that occurred between predose and 24 hours 
exclusively. The calculation of AUC was based on available data. If an AUC was “incalculable,” then the 
following resampling approach was used for imputation:  
The treatment (NaPBA or HPN-100) and dose level of the patient with the “incalculable” AUC was 
obtained. 
Patients within ± 20% of the dose of the identified treatment in Step 1 were identified. If no patients 
were available, then all patients with the closest two doses were chosen. 
Assessment report  
EMA/676925/2015  
Page 45/89 
 
 
 
 
 
Missing data were imputed by randomly selecting comparable data from patients in Step 2. The 
corresponding nominal times of the imputed values were used to impute the measurement times, 
which were needed in calculating the AUC. 
After missing data were imputed as above, the actual collection times for available samples were used, 
and the trapezoidal rule was employed to calculate the AUC. 
The proposed methods of analysis are acceptable. The results have been pooled for the Phase II and 
III studies and this approach is not supported. The results of the pivotal randomised Phase III study 
should be used as the main evidence to support this application. The non-inferiority margin of 1.25 
was discussed in the CHMP scientific advice. It was considered that this margin was too wide and 
therefore for this single pivotal study to provide compelling evidence of non-inferiority it would be 
expected that the observed upper limit of the confidence interval will be well away from 1.25. 
Overview across studies 
Eligibility criteria and dosing as well as efficacy measures and analyses were similar across the studies; 
the main differences were patient ages (adults in HPN-100-006 and UP 1204-003 and paediatric 
patients in HPN-100-005 and HPN-100-012), method of treatment assignment (double-blind, 
randomized crossover versus open label fixed sequence), and duration of dosing with each study 
treatment (2 weeks in HPN-100-006, 1 week in HPN-100-005 HPN-100-012 and UP 1204-003).  
In HPN-100-006, UCD subtypes were restricted to CPS, OTC, or ASS; i.e., those for which the active 
comparator, NaPBA, is approved, while all UCD subtypes were permitted in the Phase 2 and long-term 
studies (HPN-100-005 SE, HPN-100-007 and HPN-100-012 SE). 
Each study included patients whose UCDs were well controlled on a stable dose of NaPBA before study 
entry. In each study, patients were administered study treatment (HPN-100 and NaPBA) orally with 
meals, TID, and were converted from NaPBA to the PBA-equivalent dose of HPN-100 using the same 
approach (i.e., for each patient, the HPN-100 dose was calculated from the prescribed NaPBA dose 
before study enrolment).  
The persistence of efficacy of HPN-100 in controlling blood ammonia levels for up to one year was 
evaluated in 51 adult and 49 paediatric patients across the three similar uncontrolled open-label long-
term studies: HPN-100-007, HPN-100-005 SE and HPN-100-012 SE.  
Similarities in study design permitted pooling of the data for the comparative analyses of HPN-100 and 
NaPBA during the short-term controlled studies as well as pooling of data from the three open-label 
long-term periods during which only HPN-100 was administered.

Table 3b: Non-Inferiority Analysis of Blood Ammonia AUC0-24 by Treatment (ITT, MITT and 
PP Populations) 
The primary analysis to assess the non-inferiority of HPN-100 to NaPBA in controlling blood ammonia 
(assessed as AUC0-24 levels) was performed in the ITT population. An ANOVA model for the natural log-
transformed blood ammonia AUC0-24 was constructed with factors for treatment, sequence, patient 
nested in a sequence as a random effect, and period. The 95% CI for the difference between the HPN-
100 and NaPBA means (HPN-100 minus NaPBA) on the natural log scale were constructed. Missing 
ammonia level measurements were imputed as described in the SAP. 
The pre specified primary objective of the study was met. In the ITT population, HPN-100 achieved 
non-inferiority to NaPBA as the upper bound of the 95% CI was 1.034, i.e., well below the predefined 
non-inferiority margin of 1.25. 
Non-inferiority of HPN-100 to NaPBA in controlling blood ammonia (assessed as AUC0-24) was also 
evaluated in the MITT and PP populations. As shown in Table 3b, a consistent treatment effect was 
seen, with HPN-100 shown to be non-inferior to NaPBA in controlling blood ammonia in the MITT

• 
a) Effect on Blood Ammonia: AUC0-24 (Primary Efficacy Analysis) 
A clinically meaningful and statistically robust difference in favour of HPN-100 versus NaPBA in 
controlling blood ammonia levels, as measured by AUC0-24 (774.11 vs. 991.19 μmol∙h/L, respectively), 
was shown in the pooled analysis (Figure 1). 
The mean difference between HPN-100 and NaPBA in the ITT population (n = 78) was -178.99 
μmol∙h/L (p = 0.004, paired t-test; p = 0.002, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). The upper bound of the 
95% CI was 0.949. Results of sensitivity analyses on the primary efficacy endpoint were almost 
identical to the pooled analysis as the upper bound of the 95% CI was 0.945 when only including 
patients who had at least 4 blood ammonia samples (including the 8- or 12-hour samples) (n = 76) 
and when excluding the single patient with a randomization error (n = 77). Moreover, the 24-hour 
profile was similar among the four studies, with ammonia values consistently lower late afternoon and 
overnight during dosing with HPN-100. 
Across these studies, mean blood ammonia AUC0-24 values for each treatment at steady state ranged 
from 602.17–865.85 μmol∙h/L for HPN-100 and 813.48–1303.48 μmol∙h/L for NaPBA. The 
non-inferiority of HPN-100 to NaPBA in controlling blood ammonia assessed as AUC0-24 was 
demonstrated in each study, with the upper bound of the 95% CI below the predefined non-inferiority 
margin of 1.25: 1.116 in Study UP 1204-003, 1.095 in Study HPN-100-005, 1.034 in 
Study HPN-100-006, and 1.055 in Study HPN-100-012.

Evidence of a treatment benefit of HPN-100 versus NaPBA in controlling maximum blood ammonia 
levels was similarly demonstrated in the pooled analysis of Cmax, which was significantly lower in the 
ITT population by 12.29 ± 42.885 μmol/L during HPN-100 treatment compared with NaPBA treatment 
(p = 0.012, paired t-test; p = 0.030, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Mean blood ammonia Cmax values for

Mean blood ammonia Cmax concentrations ranged from 39.39–66.21 μmol/L for HPN-100 and 52.74–
98.40 μmol/L for NaPBA. 
c) Effect on Blood Ammonia: Blood Ammonia Values over 24 Hours  
The 24-hour blood ammonia pattern with HPN-100 treatment compared with NaPBA in the pooled 
analysis was consistent with the individual study results.  
Post-prandial increases in mean blood ammonia levels were higher early in the day with HPN-100 
(from 4 to 5 hours after dosing) and lower in the afternoon and overnight (from 6 to 12 hours after 
dosing) compared with NaPBA treatment. Mean 24-hour blood ammonia levels in the pooled analysis 
were lower on HPN-100 compared with NaPBA treatment at most time points (Figure 2).  These 
differences in the 24-hour blood ammonia profile during dosing with HPN-100 versus NaPBA are 
explained by differences in the PK of the two study treatments.

Average daily ammonia in the pooled analysis was significantly lower on HPN-100 versus NaPBA 
treatment: 31.20 ± 21.026 versus 38.29 ± 29.143 μmol/L (p = 0.008, paired t-test; p = 0.027, 
Wilcoxon signed-rank test). In all of the studies, daily average blood ammonia levels during steady-
state treatment were within the normal range (35 μmol/L) with HPN-100 treatment (range: 23.91–
34.71 μmol/L) and were slightly higher with NaPBA (range: 31.34–45.84 μmol/L).  
d) Effect on Blood Ammonia: Blood Ammonia Values above ULN 
The mean percentage of blood ammonia samples (per patient) with a value above the ULN was non-
significantly lower with HPN-100 treatment than NaPBA treatment: 28% versus 37% of samples (Table 
5). Similarly, in the pooled analysis, the percentage of all blood ammonia samples above the ULN at all 
time points was lower with HPN-100 treatment compared with NaPBA treatment: 30% (173/573 
samples) versus 37% (219/592 samples), respectively.  
Blood ammonia levels above the ULN across individual studies were similar to that of the pooled 
analysis. The mean percentage of blood ammonia samples above the ULN (per patient) was lower with 
HPN-100 treatment compared with NaPBA treatment in the open-label switch-over studies: 27% 
versus 43% in UP 1204-003, 18% versus 31% in HPN-100-005, and 13% versus 38% in 
HPN-100-012. None of the differences were statistically significant. The mean percentage of blood 
ammonia values above the ULN was similar in HPN-100-006: 36% (122/343) with HPN-100 versus 
36% (125/345) with NaPBA. Similarly, the percentage of all blood ammonia samples above the ULN at 
steady state was lower after patients switched to HPN-100 treatment from NaPBA treatment: 29% of 
HPN-100 samples (29/101) versus 43% of NaPBA samples (48/113) in UP 1204-003, 18% (14/76) 
versus 32% (24/76) of samples in HPN-100-005, and 15% (8/53) versus 38% (22/58) of samples in 
HPN-100-012.

From the pooled analysis provided, the blood ammonia lowering capacity is superior for the HPN-100 
group compared to the NaPBA group. However, it is not considered acceptable to make this claim in 
the SmPC and it is acceptable that the Applicant has not referred to the pooled analysis in the section 
5.1 of the proposed SmPC. 
e) Effect on Blood Glutamine 
Blood glutamine levels have been shown to correlate with plasma ammonia levels and symptoms in 
UCD patients and are actively involved in the alternative pathway for elimination of waste nitrogen 
through combination with PAA to form PAGN (Maestri, 1992; Tuchman, 2008). Therefore, the relative 
effect of HPN-100 and NaPBA on blood glutamine levels was evaluated in each study. The mean 
difference between the study treatments in blood glutamine levels was analyzed using the paired t-test 
and the nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test and are presented for the pooled analysis and across 
studies are presented in Figure 3.  
Results of the pooled analysis provide further evidence that HPN-100 treatment lowers blood glutamine 
levels as effectively as with NaPBA treatment (Figure 3). Mean blood glutamine levels were 
significantly lower after HPN-100 treatment compared with NaPBA treatment by 50.4 ± 154.78 μmol/L 
(p = 0.006, paired t-test; p = 0.004, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). The significant decreases in blood 
glutamine were consistent with the significant decreases in blood ammonia AUC0-24 levels of 178.99 ± 
525.964 μmol∙h/L after HPN-100 treatment compared with NaPBA in the pooled analysis of the primary 
efficacy endpoint (p = 0.004, paired t-test; p = 0.002, Wilcoxon signed-rank). Slightly fewer patients 
had glutamine levels above 1000 μmol/L on HPN-100 (9 patients [12%]) compared with NaPBA (11 
patients [14%]).

Normal range 700-740 umol/L depending on the age. 
In the open-label, fixed-sequence studies, mean blood glutamine levels on HPN-100 treatment were 
lower than on NaPBA treatment (decrease of 106.4 ± 205.34 μmol/L with HPN-100 treatment in 
UP 1204-003, 74.8 ± 134.95 μmol/L in HPN-100-005, and 20.1 ± 149.99 µmol/L in HPN-100-012), 
but the differences were not statistically significant. 
In the pivotal Phase 3 study HPN-100-006, the treatment difference in blood glutamine values was 
nearly statistically significant (decrease of 44.3 ± 154.43 μmol/L after HPN-100 compared with NaPBA; 
p = 0.064, paired t-test; p = 0.048, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Note that this statistical analysis 
differs from that in the HPN-100-006 CSR (-51.2 μmol/L; p = 0.031 paired t-test; p = 0.017 Wilcoxon 
signed-rank test), because the SAP for HPN-100-006 stipulated analysis based on treatment group 
assignment, whereas the SAP for the pooled analysis stipulated analysis based on treatment actually 
received, and 1 patient in HPN-100-006 (02-601) received the wrong treatment. Moreover, blood 
glutamine levels were lower with HPN-100 treatment than with NaPBA in each treatment period of the 
crossover study regardless of the treatment sequence (Figure 4). The bidirectional changes in 
glutamine relative to randomized treatment group assignment constitute persuasive evidence of a 
differential effect on glutamine of HPN-100 relative to NaPBA.

Note: Data for the ‘HPN-100 followed by NaPBA’ group are displaced slightly to the right to avoid 
overlap of the SE bars; baseline, Day 14, and Day 28 visits all occurred at the same time in both 
treatment arms. 
f) Urinary PAGN Analyses 
On the last day of treatment with HPN-100 and NaPBA (i.e., at steady state), U-PAGN0-24 was 
evaluated as a secondary efficacy analysis in Studies UP 1204-003, HPN-100-005, HPN-100-006, and 
in the pooled ISE analysis excluding HPN-100-012. U-PAGN0-24 was not assessed in HPN-100-012 
because timed urine collections are not possible in young children without external or internal 
catheterization, which is not ethically justifiable. Instead, spot urine samples of PAGN and PAA were 
collected, allowing for measurement of PAGN and creatinine concentrations and the PAGN-to-creatinine 
ratio. Comparison of the PAGN-to-creatinine ratio was intended to correct for any spurious differences 
between the two drugs due to differences in, for example, urine volume, because of the higher salt 
content of NaPBA, which could result in greater urine output and lower PAGN concentration.  
Mean urine PAGN concentration and urine-to-creatinine ratio were higher during treatment with 
HPN-100 than during treatment with NaPBA. Mean PAGN concentration was 13,544 mg/L during 
HPN-100 treatment versus 9665 mg/L with NaPBA, and PAGN-to-creatinine ratio was 27.6 g/g with 
HPN-100 versus 18.2 g/g with NaPBA. The results of the urine data analyses from HPN-100-012 
demonstrated that urinary PAGN output was at least as high during dosing with HPN-100 compared 
with NaPBA and varied less over 24 hours, and are consistent with those in older paediatric patients 
ages 6–17 years (HPN-100-005) and adults (UP 1204-003 and HPN-100-006) as well as the findings 
from population PK modelling. 
U-PAGN 0-24was evaluated on Day 7 and Day 14 in adult UCD patients in UP 1204-003 and in 
paediatric UCD patients ≥ 6 years of age in HPN-100-005. In the pivotal Phase 3 crossover study 
(HPN-100-006), U-PAGN0-24 was evaluated on Days 14 and 28 in adult UCD patients. In addition to 
analysis of 24-hour excretion, U-PAGN excretion during the day (0–12 hours) and night (12–24 hours) 
was evaluated. In general, U-PAGN0-24 = U-PAGN0-12 + U-PAGN12-24.  
U PAGN0-24 output was also summarized by treatment group, and the natural log-transformed value 
was analyzed using ANOVA. The ANOVA model included factors for treatment, sequence, subject 
nested in sequence (as a random effect), period, and study. The 95% CI for the difference between 
Assessment report

HPN-100 and NaPBA means (HPN-100 minus NaPBA) on the natural-log scale was constructed using 
the least square means from the ANOVA model. The difference and lower and upper CI values were 
exponentiated to express the results as geometric means, ratio of geometric means, and 
corresponding CI on the original scale. The two treatment groups also were compared using the paired 
t-test and the nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test. 
Mean U-PAGN0-24 excretion at steady state and treatment differences in pooled analysis are 
summarized in Table 6.  The amount of U-PAG N0-24 excreted in the urine after HPN-100 treatment 
was nearly identical to the amount excreted after NaPBA treatment.  
Across the studies, mean U-PAGN 0-24 hour excretion during steady-state treatment was very similar 
between the treatments and ranged from 10,960,292.73 μg to 14,050,389.39 μg with HPN-100 
treatment, and from 11,793,116.71 μg to 14,182,358.15 μg with NaPBA treatment.

Maintenance of Long Term Efficacy 
Long-Term Effect on Ammonia:  
The long-term effect on ammonia was evaluated in 51 adult and 49 paediatric UCD patients treated 
with HPN-100 in the long-term open-label studies HPN-100-005 SE, HPN-100-012 SE, and 
HPN-100-007. Among patients undergoing long-term HPN-100 treatment, all UCD subtypes, with the 
exception of CITRIN and NAGS, are represented. The relative number of patients with each subtype 
corresponds with their relative prevalence, except that a greater number of patients with ASS and ASL 
deficiencies were enrolled in HPN-100-012, as these are the subtypes that are identified by newborn 
screening. 
Over 12 months of treatment with HPN-100, mean ammonia values were within normal limits for both 
paediatric and adult patients at each monthly visit and overall were very similar to the mean fasting 
values (times 0 or 24 hours) observed during the short-term, switch-over studies (HPN-100-006, HPN-

100-005, HPN-100-012, and UP 1204-003). The mean ammonia ranged from 20.382 μmol/L (Month 
10) to 29.593 μmol/L (Month 11) across 12 months of treatment with HPN-100. 
These data collectively provide strong evidence that HPN-100 is effective in controlling ammonia for up 
to at least 12 months of treatment.

ITT = intent-to-treat; SE = standard error. Note: Mean upper limit of normal among participating sites around 35 
μmol/L. 
Long-Term Effect on Hyperammonaemic Crisis:  
The rate of hyperammonaemic events per patient during the long-term safety studies HPN-100-005 
SE, HPN-100-007 and HPN-100-012SE, is presented in Figure 6.  Hyperammonaemic crises were most 
frequent in patients aged 2–5 years who are more susceptible to toxic effect of high ammonia, both in 
the 12 months preceding the studies (1.44/patient versus. 0.53/patient overall) and during long-term 
treatment with HPN-100 (0.63/patient versus. 0.27/patient overall).  
Overall, 30 patients experienced a total of 53 hyperammonaemic events in the 12 months preceding 
enrolment in the HPN-100 studies, which represents on average 0.53 events per patient per year. With 
long-term treatment with HPN-100 in these studies, 19 patients experienced 27 hyperammonaemic 
crises, which represents on average 0.27 events per patient per year.

HAC were recorded retrospectively for 12 months prior to enrolment. 30 patients had 53 HAC over the 
previous year on NaPBA. During HPN-100 treatment over 12months, 19 patients had 27 HAC over the 
year on GPB 
When the rate of hyperammonaemic was evaluated in the 88 patients who continued to received HPN-
100 through the continued access study (HPN-100-011; mean duration 552.0 days), where they were 
followed less frequently (i.e., per standard of care or every 6 months), the rate of HAC remained 
similar to the long-term studies (HPN-100-005 SE, HPN-100-007 and HPN-100-012SE). For paediatric 
patients the rate of crises decreased from 0.78 crisis per year during the 12 months preceding 
enrolment in Hyperion trials when the patients were being treated with NaPBA to 0.36 and 0.38 during 
12-month controlled study and expanded access treatment with HPN-100, respectively, indicating the 
durability of the effect of HPN-100 during extended period of time in the most vulnerable group of 
patients (Figure 7).

Clinical Relevance of the Observed Effects 
The  slower gastrointestinal absorption of PBA given orally (75%) as HPN-100 vs. NaPBA is associated 
with more even day-night distribution of urinary PAGN excretion and significantly lower ammonia levels 
(as reflected by the results of 80 patients ages 2 months to over 70 years who underwent 24 hour 
ammonia monitoring during steady state equivalent dosing of HPN-100 and NaPBA).  
These lower ammonia levels were observed among all patient subgroups based on gender, age 
(paediatric vs. adult), UCD subtype (OTC vs. non-OTC) and age of onset, which is an indicator of 
severity. This excellent ammonia control was also maintained over 12 months of dosing in both adult 
and paediatric studies.  
The clinical relevance of the ammonia control is reflected in improved long-term outcomes, including 
approximately 50% fewer total hyperammonaemic crises during 12 months of dosing with HPN-100 as 
compared with the prior 12 months during dosing with NaPBA and improved executive function among 
children ages 6 through 17. 
The analysis of fasting ammonia in relation to both short term ammonia exposure and 
hyperammonaemic crises indicate that the fewer crises observed on HPN-100 is presumably a result of 
the better ammonia control, this is considered clinically relevant.  
Clinical studies in special populations 
No studies in special populations have been performed. However, the company has evaluated the 
results according to several post-hoc defined subgroups/criteria such as gender, age, race and 
subtype.

No hyperammonemic crises were reported with HPN-100 and no patients 
discontinued HPN-100 treatment because of a treatment emergent adverse 
event (TEAE). One patient had a treatment emergent serious adverse events 
(TESAE) of acute gastroenteritis while on HPN-100 that was attributed to food 
poisoning. In the NaPBA treatment arm, one patient had a TESAE of 
hperammonemic crisis that was related to noncompliance with diet, and one 
patient discontinued NaPBA treatment because of high blood ammonia levels 
(123 µmol/L) and headache on Day 1 of the study. 
51.1% (23/45) of patients reported TEAEs while receiving NaPBA. 61.4% 
(27/44) of patients reported TEAEs while receiving HPN-100. Most TEAEs were 
considered by the investigator to be mild in intensity. Symptoms suggestive of 
lower GI disorders (diarrhoea and flatulence) were reported more frequently on 
HPN-100 treatment whereas symptoms suggestive of upper GI disorders 
(abdominal discomfort, dyspepsia, nausea and oral discomfort) were reported 
more frequently on NaPBA treatment. 
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The design of the clinical studies had previously been discussed and for the most part the applicant has 
conducted the trials in accordance with previous scientific advice received. 
The applicant provided results from one pivotal study in adult patients with UCD and supportive studies 
in the paediatric population. The clinical programme comprised of 6 subtypes of UCD.  
As study HPN-100-006 was the only randomized study this study is considered pivotal to this 
application.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The results of the primary analysis of the pivotal study provide evidence of non-inferiority of HPN-100 
to NaPBA in terms of levels of blood ammonia. Consistent results were seen for analyses of the mITT 
and PP populations. Only 2 subjects withdrew from the study; one withdrew on Day 1 before receiving 
any study medication because she had uncontrolled blood ammonia levels and patient 07-617 
withdrew on Day 1 after receiving one dose of study drug (NaPBA) because of adverse events due to 
noncompliance with diet.  
Based on individual studies and pooled analyses of all patients, as well as separate pooled analyses of 
all adult patients and all paediatric patients, HPN-100 has been shown to provide ammonia control that 
is comparable to NaPBA. In short term studies, a statistical difference in favour of HPN-100 versus 
NaPBA in controlling blood ammonia levels, as measured by AUC0-24 (774.11 versus 991.19 μmol∙h/L, 
respectively), was shown in the pooled analysis of 80 patients, ages 2 months through over 70 years 
who underwent 24-hour ammonia monitoring during equivalent, steady state dosing of both drugs. 
The lack of controlled long term study data is a limitation in the data provided considering the urea 
cycle disorders are chronic conditions which require long term treatment, hence the need for proper 
investigation during chronic administration.  The applicant should therefore provide suitable long term 
study data during the post approval setting to further characterise long term use. Collection of the 
information will be done through the disease registry for 10 years.  
Notwithstanding, the database for long term continuous treatment in open label studies provides 
further information on RAVICTI when administered chronically, although with limitations due to the 
open design.

Comments overall across studies 
Overall, the use of both RAVICTI and NaPBA offer a benefit across the majority of the efficacy outcome 
measures. In particular, efficacy was demonstrated in the reduction for both blood ammonia and 
glutamine. 
There were no significant differences between treatment groups either patients who received RAVICTI 
and those who received the active comparator, NaPBA. However, it is acknowledged that the sustained 
release characteristics provided a better control during the day allowing nitrogen waste removal to 
occur more evenly. 17. 
The analysis of fasting ammonia in relation to both short term ammonia exposure and 
hyperammonaemic crises indicate that the fewer crises observed on HPN-100 is presumably a result of 
the better ammonia control. In the long term studies, the clinical relevance of the ammonia control is 
reflected in improved long-term outcomes, including approximately 50% fewer total 
hyperammonaemic crises during 12 months of dosing with HPN-100 as compared with the prior 12 
months during dosing with NaPBA and improved executive function among children ages 6 and above. 
As with the other efficacy measurement outcomes discussed above, across the studies, the mean 
urinary PAGN0- 24 excretion was similar between the two (HPN-100 and NaPBA) treatment groups. 
There were no apparent differences in response to the study medication between the different 
subgroups. More importantly, the numbers of the subgroups are quite small for any meaningful 
interpretation of the results. 
As only 6 of 7 UCD subtypes for which approval is sought have actually been investigated, the CHMP 
considered that there was no sufficient justification for the inclusion of the subtype of citrullinaemia 
deficiency in the indication.   
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
The pivotal and supportive clinical studies provided in the application included paediatric patients from 
the 2 months of age. 
Despite the limited number of patients this is considered acceptable to support an indication in 
paediatric patients from 2 months of age. 
The total daily dose should be individually adjusted according to the patient's protein tolerance and the 
daily protein intake needed to promote growth and development.  
The applicant demonstrated the possibility of using nasogastric tube or gastrostomy tube 
administration if oral administration would be difficult in very young patients. This is adequately 
addressed in the SmPC.  
2.6.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, the efficacy data generated from the clinical evaluation programme suggest that RAVICTI is 
effective in treatment of patients with urea cycle disorders (UCDs) as demonstrated by the results of 
the controlled short term studies. The efficacy has been demonstrated in the following subgroups of 
patients older than 2 months and suffering from UCD: including  deficiencies of carbamoyl phosphate-
synthase-I (CPS), ornithine carbamoyltransferase (OTC), argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS), 
argininosuccinate lyase (ASL), arginase I (ARG) and ornithine translocase deficiency 
hyperornithinaemia-hyperammonaemia homocitrullinuria syndrome (HHH) who cannot be managed by 
dietary protein restriction and/or amino acid supplementation alone.

2.7.  Clinical safety 
The overall safety evaluation of RAVICTI (HPN-100) consisted of pooled analyses in three different 
populations for which clinical studies involving HPN-100 were conducted as follows: studies conducted 
in Urea Cycle Disorder (UCD) patients (target population); studies conducted in healthy volunteers 
(HV); and studies conducted in patients with hepatic impairment (HI). This safety summary focuses 
primarily on the pooled analysis in the UCD target population, with some reference to the analyses 
conducted in the HV and HI population, as applicable.   
The safety evaluation of HPN-100 in the target UCD population included a pooled analysis of the four 
short-term controlled studies (UP 1204-003, HPN-100-005, HPN-100-006, and HPN-100-012) and a 
separate pooled analysis of three 12-month open-label safety studies (HPN-100-005 safety-extension 
[SE], HPN 100-012 SE, and HPN-100-007). Collectively, these studies enrolled 121 UCD patients, of 
which 114 received at least one dose of HPN-100. 
Patient exposure 
A total of 359 patients/subjects have received at least one dose of HPN-100, 114 of who were UCD 
patients, as part of the clinical development programme. 
In the pooled analyses, 85 UCD patients (59 adults, 26 paediatric patients) received at least one dose 
of HPN-100 or NaPBA in the short-term controlled studies. A total of 100 UCD patients (51 adults, 49 
paediatric patients) enrolled in one of the long-term open-label studies, including 66 patients who had 
completed one of the short-term controlled studies and 34 newly enrolled patients.  
The mean total daily dose of HPN-100 was around 11 g in the short-term controlled and long-term 
open-label studies.  Paediatric patients tended to receive larger mean total daily doses per kg of body 
weight or BSA than adult patients in the short-term controlled studies (HPN-100: 9.88 g/m2/d versus 
7.45 g/m2/d, respectively; NaPBA: 10.19 g/m2/d versus 7.73 g/m2/d, respectively). 
The median duration of exposure to HPN-100 was 51 weeks and 90 patients completed the long-term 
(12 month) open-label safety studies, of whom 88 enrolled into the continued access protocol (HPN-
100-011) to continue receiving HPN-100 until commercialization.  The mean duration of treatment 
during HPN-100-011 was 552.9 days (range: 0–957 days), and the mean total duration of treatment in 
all HPN-100 studies (i.e., including the previous study HPN-100-005SE, HPN-100-007, or HPN-100-
012SE) was 916.2 days (range: 349–1318 days). 
Since US approval in February 2013, 70 of the HPN-100-011 patients transitioned to RAVICTI, (note 
that six Canadian patients continue to receive HPN-100 under HPN-100-011) bringing the total during 
exposure in some patients to more than four years. 
Adverse events 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
For the purposes of the pooled analysis, the applicant has defined the incidence of common treatment-
emergent adverse event (TEAEs) as TEAEs occurring in ≥ 10% of patients or subjects.  These are 
presented in Table 7 for the pivotal study HPN-100-006 and the pooled short-term controlled safety 
analysis and the pooled long-term safety studies.

During short-term controlled studies (UP 1204-003, HPN-100-005, HPN-100-006 and HPN-100-012) 
53.8% (43/80) and 38.8% (33/85) of patients taking HPN-100 and NaPBA, respectively, experienced 
at least one TEAE. There were no deaths. No patient discontinued from HPN-100 treatment due to a 
TEAE, while 2 patients discontinued from NaPBA treatment because of high ammonia levels. Most 
TEAEs were considered by the investigator to be mild in severity and only one patient on HPN-100 and 
2 patients on NaPBA had a severe TEAE. Treatment-related TEAEs were reported in 33.8% and 25.9% 
of patients on HPN-100 or NaPBA treatment, respectively. The safety profile in the pooled analysis of 
the short-term controlled studies is similar to that in the short-term, double blind double dummy, 
pivotal crossover study HPN-100-006. 
The only TEAE occurring at a rate of ≥ 10% with HPN-100 treatment in the pooled short-term analysis 
was flatulence (10.0%). The most common TEAE during short-term treatment with NaPBA was nausea 
(8.2%). The most frequently reported treatment-related TEAEs reported by patients taking HPN-100 
included diarrhoea, and headache (7 [8.8%] for each). 
A larger proportion of adult than paediatric patients reported TEAEs with both HPN-100 (61.1% versus 
38.5%, respectively) and NaPBA (52.5% versus 7.7%, respectively) during the short-term controlled 
studies, although the duration of treatment differed across the studies from 10 days in paediatric 
patients ages 29 days to 5 years (1 day of NaPBA followed by 9 days of HPN-100 in HPN-100-012), 2 
weeks (1 week of NaPBA followed by 1 week of HPN-100) in adults and paediatric patients ages 6 to 17 
years (UP 1204-003 and HPN-100-005), and 4 weeks (2 weeks of HPN-100 and 2 weeks of NaPBA) in 
adults (HPN-100-006).  
Assessment report

Less common TEAEs were defined as those occurring in < 10%, but that occurred in more than 1 adult 
or more than 1 paediatric patient. Less common treatment-related TEAEs (Table 10) occurring with 
HPN-100 treatment included diarrhoea, flatulence, and headache each in 7 patients (8.8%); abdominal 
pain, fatigue, and increased appetite each in 3 patients (3.8%); and abdominal distension, upper 
abdominal pain, and dyspepsia each in 2 patients (2.5%). Less common treatment-related TEAEs 
occurring with NaPBA treatment included dyspepsia in 5 patients (5.9%); nausea in 4 patients (4.7%); 
decreased appetite, increased appetite, and food aversion each in 3 patients (3.5%); and abdominal 
discomfort, diarrhoea, gastroesophageal reflux disease, oral discomfort, dizziness, headache, and skin 
odor abnormal each in 2 patients (2.4%). 
Long-Term Safety Studies: 
While most patients (98.0%) in the open-label HPN-100 extension studies [HPN-100-005 SE, HPN-00-
007 and HPN-00-012 SE] reported at least one TEAE, only 5 (5.0%) patients discontinued study 
treatment due to a TEAE. No deaths or life-threatening TEAEs were reported. Most of the TEAEs were 
mild or moderate in severity; 20.0% of patients had a severe TEAE. 
Common TEAEs reported during long-term open-label treatment with HPN-100 included upper 
respiratory tract infection (37%), vomiting (35%), hyperammonaemia (19%), diarrhoea (16%), 
nausea and pyrexia (15% each), nasopharyngitis and decreased appetite (13% each) and headache 
(12%). 
TEAEs were reported by a slightly greater proportion of adult than paediatric patients during long-term 
open-label treatment with HPN-100 (100% and 95.9%, respectively).  
TEAEs that were notably more frequent in paediatric patients included pyrexia (22.4% paediatric, 7.8% 
adult), hyperammonaemia (24.5% paediatric, 13.7% adult), and streptococcal pharyngitis (10.2% 
paediatric, no adult). TEAEs that were notably more frequent in adults included nausea (21.6% adult, 
8.2% paediatric), fatigue (11.8% adult, 4.1% paediatric), dizziness (15.7% adult, 2.0% paediatric), 
and oropharyngeal pain (13.7% adult, 2.0% paediatric).

There were no deaths. During short-term controlled studies, three of 85 UCD patients (3.5%) reported 
a treatment-emergent serious adverse event (TESAE) in the short-term controlled studies. One patient 
(20-639) had a TESAE of acute gastroenteritis while on HPN-100 treatment, and 2 patients (06-608, 
03-001/03-004) had a TESAE of hyperammonaemia on NaPBA treatment. 
TESAEs were reported in 26 of 100 patients (26.0%) in the long-term open-label studies. None of the 
TESAEs occurring during the long-term open-label studies was considered by the investigator to be 
related to HPN-100 treatment. The most common TESAE was hyperammonaemia, which was reported 
in 18 patients. Other TESAEs included gastroenteritis in 3 patients; vomiting, hypophagia, and 
convulsion in 2 patients each; and the following in 1 patient each: abdominal pain, aggression, 
chemical burn of skin, dizziness, lobar pneumonia, lung infiltration, peripheral neuropathy, psychotic 
disorder, and pelvic pain in 1 patient each. 
Eighty-eight UCD patients from the long-term safety extension studies enrolled in the continued access 
study, HPN-100-011, which is currently ongoing for 6 Canadian patients. As of 19 February 2014, no 
patient has died. Thirty patients have experienced TESAEs.  The only TESAEs that were reported in 
more than 1 patient were hyperammonaemia (21 patients [23.9%]), abdominal pain (3 patients 
[3.4%]), and dehydration (2 patients [2.3%]). 
Adverse Event in Population Subgroups 
Differences in common TEAEs based on demographic factors and baseline characteristics were 
analysed using pooled data from the short-term controlled studies (UP 1204-003, HPN-100-005, 
HPN-100-006, HPN-100-012) separately from the long-term open-label studies (HPN-100-005 SE, 
HPN-100-007, HPN-100-012 SE) using the following demographic factors and baseline characteristics: 
age (29 days–< 2 years, 2–5 years, 6–11 years, 12–17 years, or ≥ 18 years); sex (male or female); 
race (white or non-white); UCD type (OTC or non-OTC); and age at onset of UCD (neonatal or infantile 
[birth to ≤ 2 years] or childhood or adult [> 2 years]). 
Analysis by Age: TEAEs—In the short-term controlled studies, a smaller proportion of paediatric than 
adult patients reported a TEAE with HPN-100 and NaPBA treatments. HPN-100: 38.5% of paediatric 
versus 61.1% of adult patients. NaPBA: 7.7% of paediatric versus 52.5% of adult patients. The only 
TEAEs reported in paediatric patients with HPN-100 in the short-term controlled studies that were not 
also reported in adult patients were lymphadenopathy, ear infection, cardiac murmur, and papular rash 
in 1 patient each. 
In the long-term open-label studies, a similar percentage of adult and paediatric patients reported a 
TEAE with HPN-100 treatment regardless of relationship to treatment (95.9% of paediatric versus 
100.0% of adult patients). TEAEs reported in more than one paediatric patient that were not reported

in adult patients in the long-term open-label studies included pharyngitis streptococcal (5 [10.2%]), 
ear infection (3 [6.1%]), aggression (2 [4.1%]), anion gap increased (2 [4.1%]), blood alkaline 
phosphatase increased (2 [4.1%]), dermatitis (2 [4.1%]), lymphadenopathy (2 [4.1%]), 
gastroesophageal reflux disease (2 [4.1%]), hypokalaemia (2 [4.1%]), hypophagia (2 [4.1%]), 
hyporeflexia anion gap increased (2 [4.1%]), neutropenia (2 [4.1%]), and viral infection (2 [4.1%]).   
Analysis by Gender: TEAEs— In the short-term controlled studies, a similar percentage of male and 
female patients reported a TEAE with HPN-100 and NaPBA treatments. HPN-100: 42.3% of male and 
59.3% of female patients. NaPBA: 32.1% of male and 42.1% of female patients. In the long-term 
open-label studies, a similar percentage of male versus female patients reported a TEAE with HPN-100 
treatment (97.0% of male and 98.5% of female patients). 
Analysis by Race: TEAEs— In the short-term controlled studies, a higher proportion of white than 
non-white patients reported a TEAE with HPN-100 treatment whereas a lower percentage of white than 
non-white patients reported a TEAE with NaPBA treatment. HPN-100: 54.8% of white versus 50.0% of 
non-white patients. NaPBA: 35.4% of white versus 50.0% of non-white patients. In the long-term 
open-label studies, a similar percentage of white versus non-white patients reported a TEAE with HPN-
100 treatment (97.5% of white and 100% of non-white patients). 
Analysis by UCD Type: TEAEs— In the short-term controlled studies, a similar percentage of patients 
with OTC versus non-OTC deficiency reported a TEAE with HPN-100 treatment whereas a larger 
percentage of patients who had OTC deficiency compared with non-OTC deficiency reported a TEAE 
with NaPBA treatment. HPN-100: 55.0% of OTC and 50.0% of non-OTC. NaPBA: 42.2% of OTC versus 
28.6% of non-OTC. In the long-term open-label studies, a similar percentage of OTC versus non-OTC 
patients reported a TEAE with HPN-100 treatment (98.6% of OTC and 96.8% of non-OTC). 
Analysis by Age of Onset of UCD: TEAEs— In the short-term controlled studies, a smaller 
percentage of patients diagnosed with UCD at ≤ 2 years of age versus patients diagnosed at > 2 years 
reported a TEAE with either HPN-100 or NaPBA treatments. HPN-100: 44.1% of patients diagnosed 
≤ 2 years versus 60.9% diagnosed > 2 years. NaPBA: 22.9% of patients diagnosed ≤ 2 years versus 
50.0% diagnosed > 2 years. In the long-term open-label studies, a similar percentage of patients 
diagnosed ≤ 2 years and patients diagnosed > 2 years reported a TEAE with HPN-100 treatment 
(95.9% of patients diagnosed ≤ 2 years and 100% diagnosed > 2 years). 
Adverse Events in Relation to Duration of Treatment 
The proportion of patients with new-onset TEAEs decreased during long-term use of HPN-100; TEAEs 
were reported by 77.0%, 68.4%, 57.0%, 71.4%, and 38.5% of patients treated from 0 to 3; 3 to less 
than 6; 6 to less than 9; 9 to less than 12; and greater than or equal to 12 months, respectively. 
Similarly adverse events designated as related to study drug decreased from 33% during the first 3 
months to 9.2% to 7.7% in subsequent quarters. Common TEAEs were more frequently reported 
during the first 3 months of HPN-100 treatment than at later time periods. While the incidence of the 
most common TEAEs tended to decrease with longer exposure, the incidence of respiratory tract 
infection, hyperammonaemia, headache, and diarrhoea generally remained steady over the 12 months 
of HPN-100 exposure.  
There was no increase in the number of patients who experienced a TESAE with long-term HPN-100 
exposure or who discontinued from treatment because of a TEAE with long-term exposure to HPN-100. 
Fifteen patients experienced a TESAE, and only two patients discontinued from treatment due to a 
TEAE during the long-term open-label period.

Laboratory findings 
No relevant influence of RAVICTI was found on laboratory parameters such as blood cell parameters, 
and clinical chemistry, including parameters related to electrolyte, water, and bicarbonate balance. 
Although some clinically relevant changes could be found, these were deemed not significant and not 
related to the study medication.  
The evaluation of vital signs, and ECGs did not reveal any abnormalities. The ECG evaluation also 
comprised a formal QTc study whose results were negative. 
Liver Function 
No clinically significant changes from baseline in biochemical liver tests were observed with either HPN-
100 or NaPBA. Mean changes in liver function parameters from baseline to end of treatment were 
largely similar between NaPBA and HPN-100.  
Safety in special populations 
Please refer to discussion above under sub groups 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The results of in vitro analyses of the effects of HPN-100 and its reactive metabolites indicate that PBA 
and PAA do not result in significant induction of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes commonly involved in 
drug metabolism. There was minimal induction of CYP3A4/5 by either PBA (<31% relative potency) or 
PAA (<19% relative potency) not considered enzyme inducers per 2006 Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) guidelines. Since HPN-100 was insoluble in aqueous solutions, it was therefore not possible to 
test for induction in vitro in human hepatocytes (CFU0004). By contrast, an in vitro analysis of the 
effect of HPN-100 and its metabolites PBA and PAA demonstrated that PBA and PAA, but not HPN-100, 
were reversible inhibitors (>40%) of human CYP enzymes.  
PBA was found to be a reversible inhibitor of CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5. The inhibitor constants 
(Ki) calculated for CYP2C9 and CYP2D6 were 1.3 mM and 1.5 mM, respectively (approximately 0.2 
mg/mL for both). PAA is a reversible inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and 
CYP3A4/5. The Ki calculated for CYP2C9 was 15.1 mM (approximately 2.056 mg/mL).  
Drug–drug interaction is not expected for concomitantly administered drugs that are not themselves 
P450 substrates, such as dietary supplements commonly taken by UCD patients including arginine or 
citrulline. Because HPN-100 and its metabolites do not induce P450 enzymes, administration of HPN-
100 is unlikely to attenuate the effect of concomitantly administered drugs that are substrates for P450 
enzymes. However, because PBA and PAA do inhibit CYP enzymes, an exaggerated drug effect is 
theoretically possible for concomitantly administered drugs that are also P450 substrates. Therefore an 
in vivo drug interaction study to evaluate the effect of HPN-100 on the PK of a drug that is sensitive 
substrate of CYP3A4/5 (e.g., midazolam) was initiated in January 2014 as part of post marketing 
commitment for US approval of RAVICTI (Protocol HPN-100-019).   
Results from Study HPN-100-019 described earlier in the PK section, indicate that exposure to RAVICTI 
results in decreased systemic exposure to midazolam and increased exposure to the 1-hydroxy 
metabolite of midazolam which is consistent with an induction of CYP3A4 enzyme. These findings are 
contrary to those anticipated based on the in vitro studies, which demonstrated significant inhibition of 
CYP3A4 by PBA and PAA and, instead, suggest that steady state dosing of RAVICTI results in mild 
CYP3A4 induction. Specifically, as compared with systemic midazolam exposure prior to HPN-100 
Assessment report  
EMA/676925/2015  
Page 67/89 
 
 
 
 
 
dosing, analyses following HPN-100 dosing indicated decreased exposure to intact midazolam as well 
as the increased exposure to its hydroxy metabolite. 
A clinically significant drug–drug interaction is most likely to occur with administration of drugs that are 
both CYP substrates and exhibit a narrow therapeutic range, and the dose of such drugs must be 
titrated accordingly if co-administered with HPN-100 or NaPBA. However, none of the medications 
concomitantly prescribed in >10% of the 100 UCD patients in the long-term open-label studies 
(citrulline, amino acids, other nutrients, ibuprofen, multivitamin, paracetamol, amoxicillin, 
ondansetron, ergocalciferol, calcium, and loratadine) ) or other potentially commonly used drugs in 
this population (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, proton pump inhibitors, selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors, and drugs for treating attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder) have a narrow 
therapeutic range, and no AEs were reported that could be attributed to high levels of such co-
administered drugs. 
Other Potential Drug Interactions 
The concomitant use of drugs known to cause hyperammonaemia (such as valproate) or increase 
protein catabolism (such as corticosteroids), and drugs that significantly affect renal clearance (such as 
probenecid) were prohibited in the clinical studies of patients with UCDs studies. Caution should be 
used when administering corticosteroids, probenecid, haloperidol, or valproate with HPN-100 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
TEAEs leading to early discontinuation of study treatment in the pooled analysis from the short term 
controlled studies and long-term open-label studies are summarized in Table 15. Also discussed in this 
section are TEAEs leading to early discontinuation of study treatment in the ongoing continued access 
study (Treatment Protocol HPN-100-011) in UCD patients. 
Short-Term Controlled Studies:  No patient discontinued from HPN-100 treatment because of a 
TEAE in the short term controlled studies. Two patients discontinued from NaPBA treatment because of 
a TEAE: one because of high blood ammonia levels (123 μmol/L) and headache and one because of 
severe hyperammonaemia.  
Long-Term Open-Label Studies: Five patients (5.0%) had TEAEs that led to temporary or 
permanent withdrawal from study treatment in the long-term open-label studies. No AE preferred term 
led to study drug withdrawal in more than 1 patient.  
Three of the 5 patients had study drug held or withdrawn for TEAEs considered related to study 
treatment and consistent with the known toxicity profile of HPN-100. All 3 patients had dose 
reductions. Two of these patients were newly enrolled in the safety extension, were not being treated 
with NaPBA at the time of enrolment, and experienced improvement in their symptoms following dose 
reductions of 50% during the first month of treatment. One patient subsequently completed the study, 
while the other patient remained on study for an additional 3 months on the reduced dose before 
withdrawing consent. One had a small dose reduction (from 18 to 16 mL/day) at Month 2 of treatment, 
but was withdrawn for AEs after 2 months of treatment at the reduced dose level. From the remaining 
2 patients, one withdrew due to an TESAE of unspecified psychosis, intercurrent illness unrelated to 
study drug), and then withdrew consent for reasons unrelated to toxicity (study participation required 
travel too difficult to maintain), and the other patient (3 months old at study entry) withdrew for 
hyperammonaemia during the third month of treatment. 
Continued Access Protocol HPN-100-011 — Of the 88 patients who had enrolled in the continued 
access study HPN-100-011 as of 19 February 2014, 2 patients had TEAEs leading to temporary

discontinuation of study treatment (one patient (pancreatitis) and one patient (hypocapnia)). Both 
were SAEs. The pancreatitis was considered unrelated to study drug and the hypocapnia was 
considered possibly related.

2.7.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The clinical safety database of UCD patients treated with HPN-100 over short and long term safety 
extension studies is reasonable and includes representation of 6 out of the 7 subtypes for which 
approval is sought. 
Overall HPN-100 is shown to be well tolerated. TEAEs reported by patients during HPN-100 treatment 
in short term studies were generally similar both in frequency and type to those reported by patients 
during NaPBA treatment.  
Most events were generally mild and there were no deaths or life-threatening TEAEs.  The severity and 
nature of the adverse events tended to decrease with continued exposure.  
Similarly, no clinically significant HPN-100 treatment–associated laboratory abnormalities have been 
observed. Several patients have had increased AST and or ALT; however, these were mostly 
attributable to concomitantly administered medications and/or liver test abnormalities known to be 
associated with the underlying UCD (Nagamani 2012; Gallagher 2014).  
Analysis of shift tables indicates an overall effect on transaminase levels, with no differences between 
HPN-100 and NaPBA during comparative short-term studies. 
In short term controlled studies, several (8) patients on NaPBA and none on HPN-100 discontinued 
treatment due adverse events. Given the relatively small number of patients and the lack of controlled 
data in long-term studies, no definite conclusions can be drawn on discontinuation due to adverse 
events. 
The incidences of adverse events were similar across the population subgroups including gender’ race 
or UCD subtype and there was no trend toward an increase in the incidence of any TEAE with long-
term exposure with study medications. 
Seemingly, a larger proportion of patients developed serious adverse events in open label studies even 
when taking into account the longer duration of exposure the study medication.  Although due to lack 
of controlled data in long-term studies, no definite conclusions can be drawn on the occurrence of 
these serious adverse events in the long term studies. 
Overall, the most frequently reported adverse reactions were diarrhoea, flatulence, headache (8.8%), 
decreased appetite (7%), vomiting (6.1%), fatigue, nausea and abnormal skin odour (5.3%). 
The safety data show that HPN-100 have minimal effects on the hepatic function. However, the 
converse is not the case since conversion of PAA to PAGN occurs in the liver.  In which case patients 
with hepatic impairment would be expected to have reduced conversion capability and higher plasma 
PAA and plasma PAA to PAGN ratio. Therefore, dosage for patients with mild, moderate to severe 
hepatic would need to be reduced. It is recommended to start at the lower range of the recommended 
dose. This is appropriately described in the SmPC (posology section). 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
In the safety pooled analyses of UCD patients, 26 paediatric patients received at least one dose of 
HPN-100 or NaPBA in the short-term controlled studies. A total of 49 UCD paediatric patients were 
enrolled in one of the long-term open-label studies. 
Assessment report  
EMA/676925/2015  
Page 70/89 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the short-term controlled studies, a smaller proportion of paediatric than adult patients reported a 
TEAE with HPN-100 and NaPBA treatments. 
HPN-100: 38.5% of paediatric versus 61.1% of adult patients. NaPBA: 7.7% of paediatric versus 
52.5% of adult patients.  
The only TEAEs reported in paediatric patients with HPN-100 in the short-term controlled studies that 
were not also reported in adult patients were lymphadenopathy, ear infection, cardiac murmur, and 
papular rash in 1 patient each. 
In the long-term open-label studies, a similar percentage of adult and paediatric patients reported a 
TEAE with HPN-100 treatment regardless of relationship to treatment (95.9% of paediatric versus 
100.0% of adult patients). TEAEs reported in more than one paediatric patient that were not reported 
in adult patients in the long-term open-label studies included pharyngitis streptococcal, ear infection, 
aggression, anion gap increased, blood alkaline phosphatase increased, dermatitis, lymphadenopathy, 
gastroesophageal reflux disease, hypokalemia , hypophagia, hyporeflexia anion gap increased, 
neutropenia and viral infection.  
2.7.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Generally, the safety profile of  RAVICTI appears to be acceptable and seems to be overall well 
tolerated. The safety database is appropriate for both adults and paediatric populations although the 
duration of the long term studies remains limited. However, considering the rarity of the disease, this 
is acceptable in support of an approval. The Company is proposing a disease registry. This will enable 
long term collection of safety data especially in young paediatric patients over 10 years to further 
characterise the safety profile of Ravicti. The CHMP agrees to have this registry as a condition to the 
marketing authorisation. 
2.8.  Risk Management Plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 3 could be acceptable. The PRAC 
endorsed PRAC Rapporteur assessment report is attached.

levels may be useful to guide dosing. The plasma PAA to 
PAGN (both measured in mcg/ml) ratio has been 
observed to be generally less than 1 in patients without 
PAA accumulation. In patients with a PAA to PAGN 
ratio exceeding 2.5, a further increase in RAVICTI dose 
may not increase PAGN formation, even if plasma PAA 
concentrations are increased, due to saturation of the 
conjugation reaction. In such cases, increasing the dosing 
frequency may result in a lower plasma PAA level and 
PAA to PAGN ratio. Ammonia levels must be monitored 
closely when changing the dose of RAVICTI. 
Adjustment based on urinary phenylacetylglutamine 
U-PAGN measurements may be used to help guide 
RAVICTI dose adjustment and assess compliance. Each 
gram of U-PAGN excreted over 24 hours covers waste 
nitrogen generated from 1.4 grams of dietary protein. If 
U-PAGN excretion is insufficient to cover daily dietary 
protein intake and the fasting ammonia is greater than 
half the recommended ULN, the RAVICTI dose should 
be adjusted upward. The amount of dose adjustment

should factor in the amount of dietary protein that has not 
been covered, as indicated by the 24-h U-PAGN level 
and the estimated RAVICTI dose needed per gram of 
dietary protein ingested. 
Spot U-PAGN concentrations below the following levels 
may indicate improper medicinal product administration 
and/or lack of compliance:  
•  9000 microgram (mcg/ml) for patients under 2 
years of age  
•  7000 microgram (mcg/ml) for patients >2 years of 
age with a BSA of ≤1.3  
•  5000 microgram (mcg/ml) for patients >2 years of 
age with a BSA of >1.3 
If spot U-PAGN concentrations fall below these levels, 
assess compliance with medicinal product and/or 
effectiveness of medicinal product administration (e.g., 
via feeding tube) and consider increasing the RAVICTI 
dose in compliant patients to achieve optimal ammonia 
control (within normal limit for patients under 2 years of 
age and less than half ULN in older patients when 
fasted). 
SmPC, Section 4.4 
PAA Toxicity 
Reversible clinical manifestations suggestive of 
neurotoxicity (e.g., nausea, vomiting, somnolence) have 
been reportedly associated with phenylacetate levels 
ranging from 499-1285 mcg/ml in cancer patients who 
received PAA intravenously. Although these have not 
been seen in clinical trials involving UCD patients, high 
PAA levels should be suspected in patients with 
unexplained somnolence, confusion, nausea and lethargy 
who have normal or low ammonia. 
If symptoms of vomiting, nausea, headache, somnolence, 
confusion, or sleepiness are present in the absence of high 
ammonia or other intercurrent illnesses, measure plasma 
PAA and plasma PAA to PAGN and consider reduction 
of RAVICTI dosage or increase the frequency of dosing 
if the PAA level exceeds 500 mcg/L and the plasma PAA 
to PAGN ratio exceeds 2.5. 
SmPC, Section 4.9 
PAA, the active metabolite of glycerol phenylbutyrate, is 
associated with signs and symptoms of neurotoxicity (see 
section 4.4) and could accumulate in patients who receive 
an overdose. In case of overdose, discontinue the drug 
and monitor the patient for any signs or symptoms of 
adverse reactions.

concomitant use of medicinal products known to inhibit 
lipase given that glycerol phenylbutyrate is hydrolysed by 
digestive lipase into phenylbutyrate acid and glycerol. 
This may be associated with increased risk of medicinal 
product interactions with lipase inhibitors and with lipase 
contained in pancreatic enzyme replacement therapies.  
A potential effect on CYP2D6 isoenzyme cannot be 
excluded and caution is advised for patients who receive 
medicinal products that are CYP2D6 substrates.  
Glycerol phenylbutyrate and/or its metabolites, PAA and 
PBA, have been shown to be weak inducers of CYP3A4 
enzyme in vivo. In vivo exposure to glycerol 
phenylbutyrate has resulted in decreased systemic 
exposure to midazolam of approximately 32% and 
increased exposure to the 1-hydroxy metabolite of 
midazolam, suggesting that steady-state dosing of 
glycerol phenylbutyrate results in CYP3A4 induction. 
The potential for interaction of glycerol phenylbutyrate as 
a CYP3A4 inducer and those products predominantly 
metabolised by the CYP3A4 pathway is possible. 
Therefore, therapeutic effects and/or metabolite levels of 
medicinal products, including some oral contraceptives  
that are substrates for this enzyme may be reduced and 
their full effects cannot be guaranteed, following co-
administration with glycerol phenylbutyrate. 
Effects of glycerol phenylbutyrate on other CYP

be excluded.

SmPC, Section 4.2 
Hepatic impairment 
Because conversion of PAA to PAGN occurs in the liver, 
patients with severe hepatic impairment may have 
reduced conversion capability and higher plasma PAA 
and plasma PAA to PAGN ratio. Therefore, dosage for 
adult and paediatric patients with mild, moderate or 
severe hepatic impairment should be started at the lower 
end of the recommended dosing range (4.5 ml/m2/day) 
and kept at the lowest dose necessary to control the 
patient’s ammonia levels. A plasma PAA to PAGN ratio 
exceeding 2.5 may indicate saturation of PAA to PAGN 
conversion capacity and the need for reduced dosing 
and/or increased frequency of dosing. The plasma PAA 
to PAGN ratio may be useful in dosage monitoring. (see 
section 5.2). 
SmPC, Section 5.2 
Hepatic impairment 
In a study in patients with clinically decompensated 
cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy (Child-Pugh B and 
C), mean Cmax of PAA was 144 microgram/ml (range: 14-
358 microgram /ml) after daily dosing of 6 ml of glycerol 
phenylbutyrate twice daily, while mean Cmax of PAA was 
292 micrograms /ml (range: 57-655 microgram/ml) after 
daily dosing of 9 ml of glycerol phenylbutyrate twice 
daily. The ratio of mean values for PAA to PAGN among 
all patients dosed with 6 ml BID ranged from 0.96 to 1.28 
and for patients dosed with 9ml twice daily ranged from 
1.18-3.19.After multiple doses, a PAA concentration 
>200 microgram /L was associated with a ratio of plasma 
PAA to PAGN concentrations higher than 2.5.  
These findings collectively indicate that conversion of 
PAA to PAGN may be impaired in patients with severe 
hepatic impairment and that a plasma PAA to PAGN 
ratio > 2.5 identifies patients at risk of elevated PAA 
levels.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Urea Cycle Disorders are very rare, serious and life threatening disorders comprising a group of 
inherited deficiencies of one of the enzymes or transporters involved in the urea cycle, which converts 
ammonia to urea. Absence or severe dysfunction of the enzymes or transporters results in 
accumulation of toxic levels of ammonia in the blood and brain of affected patients.  Although 
genetically distinct, the Urea Cycle Disorders share important features and are therefore typically 
considered as a group. The most important clinical manifestations common to Urea Cycle Disorders are 
attributable to hyperammonaemia.  
Although the less severe Urea Cycle Disorders subtypes can be managed by dietary protein restriction 
and/or amino acid supplementation alone, for most of them, this therapy is less than satisfactory, thus 
an unmet medical need has therefore to be considered. NaPBA is the only currently approved 
treatment in EU for the treatment UCDs since 1999 (AMMONAPS) and more recently as PHEBURANE. 
RAVICTI (HPN-100) consists of three molecules of phenylbutyric acid (PBA) joined to glycerol to form a 
short-chain triglyceride, which appears to be digested by pancreatic lipases to release PBA. Regarding 
the pharmacodynamics activity of the compound, RAVICTI (HPN-100) has the same mechanism of 
action as sodium phenylbutyrate (NaPBA). 
The applicant provided results from one pivotal randomised study in adults patients (study HPN -100-
006) with Urea Cycle Disorders and five supportive studies in the paediatric population in children 
above 2 months of age. Short term results and long term are provided in the application. The studies 
investigated the use in patients with Urea Cycle Disorders in the following subgroups of patients older 
than 2 months and suffering from UCD: including deficiencies of carbamoyl phosphate-synthase-I, 
ornithine carbamoyltransferase, argininosuccinate synthetase, argininosuccinate lyase, arginase I,

ornithine translocase deficiency and hyperornithinaemia-hyperammonaemia homocitrullinuria 
syndrome. 
RAVICTI is intended for the treatment of urea cycle disorders in adults and on children over 2 months. 
There are no data provided for children less than two months. 
The results of the primary analysis of the pivotal study (HPN 100-006) including 51 adult patients  
provide evidence of non-inferiority of HPN-100 to NaPBA in terms of levels of blood ammonia. 
Consistent results were seen for analyses of the mITT and per protocol populations. Overall, there 
were no significant differences between treatment groups either patients who received RAVICTI and 
those who received the active comparator NaPBA. However, it is acknowledged that the sustained 
release characteristics provided a better control during the day allowing nitrogen waste 
removal to occur more evenly.  
Overall, the use of both RAVICTI and NaPBA offer a benefit across the majority of the efficacy outcome 
measures. In particular, efficacy was demonstrated in the reduction for both blood ammonia and 
glutamine. 
The analysis of fasting ammonia in relation to both short term ammonia exposure and 
hyperammonaemic crises indicate that the fewer crises observed on HPN-100 is a result of the better 
ammonia control. In the long term studies, the clinical relevance of the ammonia control is reflected 
in improved long-term outcomes, including approximately 50% fewer total hyperammonaemic crises 
during 12 months of dosing with HPN-100 as compared with the prior 12 months during dosing with 
NaPBA. 
In short term studies performed in the paediatric population (49 patients from 2 months of age), a 
statistical difference in favour of HPN-100 versus NaPBA in controlling blood ammonia levels, as 
measured by AUC0-24 (774.11 versus 991.19 μmol∙h/L, respectively), was shown in the pooled analysis 
of 80 patients aged 2 months through over 70 years who underwent 24-hour ammonia monitoring 
during equivalent, steady state dosing of both drugs. 
Across the studies, the mean urinary PAGN 0- 24 excretion (secondary endpoint) was similar between 
the two HPN-100 and NaPBA treatment groups. 
There were no apparent differences in response to the study medication between the different 
subgroups of UCDs. More importantly, the numbers of the subgroups are quite small for any 
meaningful interpretation of the results per subgroup. 
RAVICTI offers advantages over NaPBa in terms of absence of sodium, removal of pill burden as it 
administered in the form of a solution, and may therefore be more palatable particularly to children.   
Additionally, for patients who have compromised neurological functioning due to their inherent UCD, 
Ravicti is an improved formulation with flexibility to be easily administered either via nasogastric tube 
or gastrostomy tube compared with the current approved product formulations.  
The use of RAVICTI is however  limited to the chronic management of UCDs  in specific subtypes and 
not for the treatment of patients with acute hyperammonaemia as more rapidly acting interventions 
are essential to reduce plasma ammonia levels.  
Ravicti must be used with dietary protein restriction and sometimes dietary supplements based on the 
UCD subtype. A total daily range dose is recommended between 4.5 ml/m2/day and 11,2 mL/m2/day. 
The daily dose should be individually adjusted according to the patient’s protein tolerance and the daily 
dietary protein intake needed.

Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
The long term data provided are based on uncontrolled studies.  The lack of controlled long term study 
data is obviously unsatisfactory and contributes significantly to the uncertainty regarding the 
knowledge about the beneficial effects.  Although it is recognised that the urea cycle disorders are rare 
diseases, with patient recruitment difficulties, these are nevertheless chronic conditions which require 
to be studied over long term treatment.   
The database for long term continuous treatment in open label studies shows that RAVICTI may be 
effective when administered chronically.  However, in the absence of controlled study data, this is 
difficult to draw definite conclusions.  Therefore there is a need to gather further long term efficacy 
data in the post marketing setting. A disease registry has been agreed as part of the Marketing 
authorisation in order to follow patients and provide results regular results on efficacy and safety data. 
Additionally only 6 subtypes of Urea cycle disorders have been studied. Therefore the indication is 
limited in these subtypes including deficiencies of carbamoyl phosphate-synthase-I, ornithine 
carbamoyltransferase, argininosuccinate synthetase, argininosuccinate lyase, arginase I and ornithine 
translocase deficiency hyperornithinaemia-hyperammonaemia homocitrullinuria syndrome . 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The clinical safety database of UCD patients treated with HPN-100 over short and long term safety 
extension studies is adequate in both adults and paediatric populations above 2 years and includes 
representation of 6 out of the 7 subtypes.  The adverse events reported by patients during short term 
treatment with RAVICTI were generally similar both in frequency and type to those reported by 
patients receiving the active comparator, NaPBA.  
The most frequently reported adverse reactions were diarrhoea, flatulence, headache (8.8%), 
decreased appetite (7%), vomiting (6.1%), fatigue, nausea and abnormal skin odour (5.3%). 
The incidences of adverse events were similar across the population subgroups including gender’ race 
or UCD subtype and there was no trend toward an increase in the incidence of any TEAE with long-
term exposure with study medications. 
Seemingly, a larger proportion of patients developed serious adverse events in open label studies even 
when taking into account the longer duration of exposure the study medication.  Although due to lack 
of controlled data in long-term studies, no definite conclusions can be drawn on the occurrence of 
these serious adverse events in the long term studies. 
The safety data show that HPN-100 have minimal effects on the hepatic function. In patients with 
hepatic impairment, reduced conversion capability is expected resulting in higher plasma phenylacetic 
acid (PAA) and plasma PAA to phenylacetylglutamine ratio. Therefore, dosage for patients with mild, 
moderate to severe hepatic would need to be reduced. It is recommended to start at the lower range 
of the recommended dose.  
In the paediatric short-term controlled studies, a smaller proportion of paediatric than adult patients 
reported a TEAE with HPN-100 and NaPBA treatments. The safety profile appears similar than in adults 
with however few ADRs not observed in adults. However, due to the limited exposure no definite 
conclusion can be drawn.

Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
There is limited formal pharmacokinetic study data which tend to suggest that the pharmacokinetics of 
RAVICTI may not have been fully characterised. However, the data available and the knowledge about 
the currently authorised product containing NaPBa, provide further scientific data taking into account 
the similarity of RAVICTI and NaPBa in term of mechanism of action.  
Apart from the one study no other interaction studies have been performed. However, the potential for 
adverse interaction with some other preparations commonly used in these disease conditions may 
exist.  
The safety profile over long term remains not fully characterised in the subtypes studied. Therefore the 
company is requested to provide long term data for a period of 10 years through a disease registry. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The results of the primary analysis of the pivotal study provide evidence of non-inferiority of HPN-100 
to NaPBA in terms of levels of blood ammonia. Consistent results were seen for analyses of the mITT 
and per protocol populations. Ravicti has been shown to exert beneficial effects in a consistent manner 
in form of reduction for both blood ammonia and glutamine on adult and paediatric patients.  Overall, 
the results of short term studies provide clinically relevant results in some subtypes of UCD. 
The observed favourable effects are considered to be clinically relevant in the adult and paediatric 
population above 2 months of age.  
The unfavourable effects appear to be restricted to relatively minor complaints of body odour, 
abdominal pain and nausea for patients of all age groups.  In paediatric patients, vomiting, body odour 
and abdominal pain/distress were most common.  However, there is some uncertainty regarding the 
adverse events profile especially in the long term as no definite conclusions can be drawn on the 
incidence of the serious adverse events in open label studies. 
The safety and efficacy of RAVICTI for the treatment of patient less than 2 months of age and/or 
patients with N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS) deficiency has not been established. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The observed favourable effects are considered to be clinically relevant in the adult and paediatric 
population above 2 months of age and sufficiently demonstrated in sub group of patients with Urea 
cycle disorders (eg in patients with deficiencies in CPS, OTC, ASS, ASL, ARG, or HHH syndrome). 
There are however no data in paediatric patients below 2 months of age. Further studies will be 
provided in the post approval setting.  
The sustained release characteristics of RAVICTI allow waste nitrogen removal, which occurs evenly 
throughout the day. This effect results in better blood ammonia control throughout the day with 
reduction in hyperammonaemic events observed in UCD patients.   
Finally, there is limited information in relation to chronic use on patients with UCDs. The disease 
registry requested by CHMP will provide further information in the post authorisation setting.

“RAVICTI is indicated for use as adjunctive therapy  for chronic management of adult and paediatric 
patients ≥2 months of age with urea cycle disorders (UCDs) including deficiencies of carbamoyl 
phosphate-synthase-I (CPS), ornithine carbamoyltransferase (OTC), argininosuccinate synthetase 
(ASS), argininosuccinate lyase (ASL), arginase I (ARG) and ornithine translocase deficiency 
hyperornithinaemia-hyperammonaemia homocitrullinuria syndrome (HHH) who cannot be managed by 
dietary protein restriction and/or amino acid supplementation alone. 
RAVICTI must be used with dietary protein restriction and, in some cases, dietary supplements (e.g., 
essential amino acids, arginine, citrulline, protein-free calorie supplements).” 
is favourable and therefore recommends  the granting of the  marketing authorisation subject to the 
following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Conditions and requirements of the Marketing Authorisation  
• 
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation.  
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
• 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
• 
• 
At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.

• 
Obligation to complete post-authorisation measures 
The MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the below measures: 
Description 
Non-interventional post-authorisation safety study (PASS):  
Multi-centre prospective non-interventional registry in patients with urea cycle 
disorders on treatment with glycerol phenylbutyrate to characterise patients` 
demographics, and to document long-term safety and clinical outcomes  
Due date 
Final study report 
expected in July 
2030. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the review of data on the quality, non-clinical and clinical properties of the active substance, 
the CHMP considers that the active substance glycerol phenylbutyrate is to be considered a new active 
substance in comparison to the known substance, sodium phenylbutyrate previously authorised in the 
European  Union,  as  it  differs  significantly  in  properties  with  regard  to  safety  and  efficacy  from  the 
previously authorised substance. 
Paediatric Data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0068/2014 and the results of these studies are reflected in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive genetic condition with an incidence of approximately 
1:3500 in most European and North American countries and 1:5000 to 1:20,000 in Latin America, the 
Kalydeco II-09  
EMA/CHMP/360053/2014 
Page 6/90 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Middle East, and South Africa. Progressive obstructive lung disease causes over 90% of deaths in 
patients with CF. Mutations in the gene coding for the CF Transmembrane Conductance Regulator 
(CFTR) result in an absent or dysfunctional protein at the surface of certain epithelia. Although CF 
affects multiple organs, the leading cause of mortality is the progressive loss of lung function. 
CFTR is a 1480–amino acid ATP-binding cassette transporter protein that contains two membrane-
spanning domains (MSD1 and MSD2) that form the chloride channel pore, two nucleotide-binding 
domains (NBD1 and NBD2) that bind and hydrolyse ATP to open and close the channel pore (channel 
gating), and a regulatory domain with several protein kinase A phosphorylation sites. Formation of the 
CFTR channel requires the coordinated folding and assembly of the individual membrane and 
cytoplasmic domains. Each MSD is composed of six transmembrane segments (TM1–6 and TM7–12) 
that are associated with long α-helical cytosolic extensions known as coupling helices, which are 
connected by intracellular loops (ICLs). Contact formation between the ICLs and NBDs is critical for the 
proper assembly and Cl− channel function of CFTR.  
CFTR normally transports chloride to regulate salt, fluid, and pH balance in multiple organs. In people 
with CF, the loss of chloride transport due to defects in the CFTR protein results in the accumulation of 
thick, sticky mucus in the bronchi of the lungs, loss of exocrine pancreatic function, impaired intestinal 
absorption, reproductive dysfunction and elevated sweat chloride concentration2.  
More than 1500 CFTR mutations have been identified, but the functional importance is known only for 
a small number. Evaluation of the molecular defect in the CFTR protein caused by CFTR mutations has 
shown that the loss of chloride transport can be due to a reduction in the quantity and/or function of 
CFTR channels at the cell surface. Gating mutations result in a CFTR protein with a primary defect of 
low channel open probability compared to normal CFTR. Gating refers to the amount of time in which 
the CFTR channel is open and can transport chloride. Ten CFTR mutations that lead to a CFTR gating 
functional defect have been identified: G551D, G178R, G551S, S549N, S549R, G970R, G1244E, 
S1251N, S1255P, and G1349D3.  
Gating mutations are present in about 5% of the CF patient population worldwide and in the EU. 
Approximately 4% of patients have the G551D mutation (approximately 1083 patients in the EU and 
2374 worldwide), and the remaining 1% has other gating mutations (205 subjects in the EU and 370 
worldwide; see table below).

Table 1.  Prevalence of the G551D-CFTR and Other CFTR Gating Mutations in Patients with Cystic 
Fibrosis 
The G551D mutation is the most common gating mutation worldwide. While reports of individual cases 
and small cohorts of patients show variable phenotypes in patients carrying the G551D mutation the 3 
largest genotype-phenotype association studies that evaluate patients from different geographical 
regions have classified the G551D mutation as being associated with a severe phenotype with rates of 
lung disease progression and mortality that are similar to other severe phenotypes. There are few 
published reports on the clinical features of patients with other non-G551D gating mutations; however 
an analysis of the US CF Foundation Patient Registry data revealed that the rates of lung disease 
progression in patients with these mutations are similar to that of patients with the G551D mutation. 
Ivacaftor, also referred to as VX-770, is an orally bioavailable small molecule that claims to provide a 
new therapeutic approach to the treatment of CF by targeting the pathophysiology of cystic fibrosis – 
the dysfunctional CFTR protein. Ivacaftor represents a proposed new class of drugs, CFTR modulators, 
which restore the function of the CFTR protein. Ivacaftor is a type of CFTR modulator known as a CFTR 
potentiator. Ivacaftor acts on the CFTR protein to increase the channel open probability (or gating) to 
enhance chloride transport. Ivacaftor was found to be highly selective for CFTR in vitro, as determined 
Kalydeco II-09  
EMA/CHMP/360053/2014 
Page 8/90 
 
 
 
 
 
 
by its lack of ability to interact with, or modulate the activities of, a broad panel of receptors and 
enzymes. In vitro, ivacaftor increased the channel activity of G551D-CFTR protein expressed in 
recombinant cell and primary human bronchial epithelial cell cultures. In vitro results showed that 
ivacaftor increased chloride transport also in other CFTR gating mutations. 
Ivacaftor is the first CFTR modulator to show an improvement in CFTR function and clinical benefit in 
subjects with CF who have a gating mutation in the CFTR gene. Kalydeco was authorised in the EU on 
23 July 2012 for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients age 6 years and older who have a 
G551D mutation in the CFTR gene. The initially proposed extension to the indication is for the 
treatment of CF in patients age 6 years and older who have a G551D or other gating (or Class III, also 
referred as non-G551D gating mutation) in the CFTR gene. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
The Applicant submitted results of an in vitro study (study CBDM304464 “Evaluation of the Substrate 
and Inhibitor Potential of VX-770, VRT-842917, and VRT-837018 of Organic Anion Transporting 
Polypeptide 1B1 and 1B3”) that is described in the clinical section as it may have clinical relevance. No 
other new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable 
by the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The MAH stated that the environmental assessment of ivacaftor submitted in the initial MAA is still 
applicable to the current submission, since the patient population considered in calculations of the 
initial assessment included all CF patients in the EU aged 6 years and over, so individuals with Gating 
mutations, which are included in the claimed indication, represent a small sub-set of the all CF 
patients. Therefore, the PECsw value for ivacaftor of 0.009 μg/L as derived from the initial assessment 
remains a conservative estimate, even if the extension of the indication is granted. 
2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The study to investigate the substrate and inhibitor potential of ivacaftor and its metabolites M1 and 
M6 for OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 transporters in HEK cells is evaluated in the clinical part of this 
assessment report. Absence of other new non-clinical studies is accepted in the light of non-clinical 
data provided in the initial application and post-authorisation. 
Regarding the environmental assessment of ivacaftor, the MAH pointed that the environmental 
assessment of ivacaftor submitted in the initial MAA is still applicable to the current submission, since 
the patient population considered in calculations of the initial assessment included all CF patients in the 
EU aged 6 years and over, so individuals with Gating mutations, which are included in the claimed 
indication, represent a small sub-set of the all CF patients. This justification for the lack of an update 
ERA assessment is adequate. Therefore, the PECsw value for ivacaftor is 0.009 μg/L as derived from 
the initial assessment. 
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Please refer to clinical section for discussion on in vitro study CBDM304464. Absence of any other new 
non-clinical data is considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
Considering the available data, ivacaftor is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The pivotal study for the proposed extension to the indication of Kalydeco is study VX12-770-111 
(study 111), a phase 3, two-part, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study with 
an open-label period to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ivacaftor in subjects with cystic fibrosis who 
have a non-G551D-CFTR gating mutation. Only the results of the crossover part of the study (Part 1) 
are discussed in this report. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
No new pharmacokinetic data are discussed in the documentation provided in support of this extension 
of the indication with the exception of a population PK/PD model based on the prior model for ivacaftor 
and incorporating data from Part 1 of study 111 (Report J106). In addition, an update on the analytical 
methods is presented as well as a final report (dated September 17, 2013) of an in vitro study entitled 
“Evaluation of the Substrate and Inhibitor Potential of VX-770, VRT-842917, and VRT-837018 of 
Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide 1B1 and 1B3” that is addressed in this section of the report. 
Analytical methods 
The Applicant has submitted the final bioanalytical study report J094 in which the calibration curve and 
quality control data met the pre-specified acceptance criteria for all batches of samples analysed.  
An analytical method was developed and validated for the determination of ivacaftor, M1, and, M6 in 
K3EDTA or K2EDTA human plasma using d4-VX-770, d4-VRT-837018 (d4-M1) or d4-VRT-842917 (d4-
M6) for ivacaftor, M1 and M6 ISTDs, respectively. The method was validated over the range of 2.00 to 
2000 ng/mL (slightly lower for M1 after adjustment) for all analytes using LC-MS/MS. This method is 
described in Standard Analytical Method VX-770-008 and was validated in study VX-770-DMPK-VAL-
033 (report number E053) and in several addenda. 
The performance of this assay was carried out in line with international bioanalytical guidelines (Food 
and Drug Administration Bioanalytical Method Validation, 2001). The pre-study validations of the 
analytical methods are satisfactory. In-study validation was conducted for the individual studies, and 
validation data are submitted and included in the respective bioanalytical study summaries. The 
calibration curve and quality control data met the pre-specified acceptance criteria for all batches of 
samples analysed and are described in the bioanalytical report in Report IJ094. The QCs used are 
representative of the calibration range. Dilution samples were not necessary. No Incurred sample 
reanalysis (ISR) was performed as the ISR was performed in previous studies. For all analytes, the 
maximum storage period between collection and analysis was no longer that the current validated 
storage period at -80 ºC. All samples were analysed within the demonstrated long-term stability 
period. Chromatograms of calibrators, QCs, and subject samples (and corresponding sample 
sequences) from at least 20% of the subject samples analysed were included.

The MAH stated that in study 111 there were approximately 50% lower M1 metabolite exposure 
compared to studies in the original MAA submission. The apparent difference in M1 exposure has been 
attributed to the implementation of a new M1 reference standard lot. The purity of an older M1 
reference standard used for analysis of samples in the original submission (Lot H04966-106) has been 
found to be significantly lower than originally measured, resulting in an overestimation of M1 
concentrations in the studies supporting the original submission. How to deal with this issue is 
currently being discussed and is not in the scope of the current procedure as the lower purity of the old 
reference standard lot does not affect study 111. In this study, the lot REF-10-011 (P10525-015) has 
been used and the residue of ignition (ROI) has been taken into account for purity calculation. No 
correction due to the purity correct assay value is needed. 
Interaction with Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide 1B1 and 1B3 
Considering that hepatic metabolism and elimination in the faeces are the predominant routes of 
elimination for ivacaftor and its metabolites, involvement of QATP1B1 and 1B3 uptake transporters 
should have been investigated. Within the current submission the MAH submitted the final report 
(dated September 17, 2013) of an in vitro study entitled “Evaluation of the Substrate and Inhibitor 
Potential of VX-770, VRT-842917, and VRT-837018 of Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide 1B1 and 
1B3”, that is discussed in this section as even though it is an in vitro study it addresses potential 
interactions that may have clinical relevance.  
The uptake transporter substrate and inhibition potential of ivacaftor (VX-770), VRT-837018 (M1), and 
VRT-842917 (M6) was evaluated in a cellular uptake assay. HEK cells transfected with human 
OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 were run in parallel with vector control (non-transfected) cells according to the 
Guideline on drug interactions. The IC50 values for OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 inhibition by M1 were 12.1 
μM and 39.8 μM and for M6 were 23.9 μM and 86.5 μM, respectively. 
It was concluded that ivacaftor and its metabolite M1 are not substrates of OATP1B1 or OATP1B3, 
whereas the metabolite M6 is a substrate for both OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. In addition, ivacaftor is not 
an inhibitor of OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 since the inhibition did not exceed 50%, whereas M1 and M6 
showed greater than 50% inhibition towards OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. 
The MAH was further requested to discuss the potential clinical relevance of the in vitro results of 
ivacaftor, M1 and M6 given that according to the Guideline on Investigations of Drug Interactions 
(EMA/CHMP/EWP/125211/2010) potential inhibition of hepatic uptake transporters should be based on 
comparison with a 25-fold unbound hepatic inlet concentration. For the unbound Cmax or Iin, max values 
for M1 and M6 were 0.0713 μM and 0.0578 μM, respectively. The multiplication by a factor of 25 will 
lead to unbound Cmax or Iin, max values of 1.78 μM and 1.45 μM. Since the 25-fold unbound hepatic inlet 
concentrations for both the M1 and M6 metabolites are much lower than IC50 values, clinically relevant 
interactions are not expected between ivacaftor or its metabolites and OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 
substrates. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
As for pharmacokinetics, no new pharmacodynamic data has been submitted in support of the 
indication extension with the exception of a population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) 
analysis including data from study 111, Part 1. The objectives of this PK/PD analysis are mainly 
descriptive. Available pharmacodynamic data (mainly from the initial MAA submission) supporting the 
use of ivacaftor in class III gating mutations other than G551D is presented and discussed below.

Primary pharmacodynamics 
Ivacaftor has been shown in cell-based assays to increase CFTR channel gating and enhance chloride 
transport. However, the exact mechanism leading ivacaftor to prolong the gating activity of some 
mutant CFTR forms has not been completely elucidated. Taking into account that in recently published 
papers the mechanism of action of ivacaftor is further investigated the MAH was requested to provide 
an update of the mechanism of action of ivacaftor that focuses on CFTR gating mutations. If ivacaftor 
was shown to interact with the mechanisms involved in channel gating this would have provided 
further reassurance that all gating mutations are indeed suitable for treatment with ivacaftor from a 
mechanistic point of view. 
The in vitro pharmacological activity of ivacaftor on multiple mutant CFTR forms has been 
characterized in electrophysiological and immunoblot studies using recombinant cell lines, such as 
Fischer rat thyroid (FRT) cells, or cultured CF HBE cells isolated from donor bronchi obtained from 
patients with CF. Each FRT cell line was engineered to express a single human mutant CFTR form. The 
use of recombinant cells to profile the activity of ivacaftor against multiple mutant CFTR forms was 
necessary as cultured CF human bronchial epithelia (HBE) cells were available only for a limited 
number of CFTR mutations. When available, cultured HBE provided a physiologically relevant cell 
system to monitor the pharmacological action of ivacaftor, as cultured CF HBE exhibit several defects 
in airway epithelial cell function that are believed to contribute to the development of CF lung disease, 
including low chloride transport, excessive sodium transport, defective fluid regulation, and decreased 
cilia beating. 
Experimentally, CFTR-mediated chloride transport was measured in Ussing chamber studies as a 
change in the short circuit current (ISC) following addition of a cyclic adenosine monophosphate 
(cAMP) agonist, such as forskolin. To directly measure the channel open probability and conductance of 
a single CFTR channel at the cell surface, single-channel patch clamp techniques were used. The 
quantity of CFTR at the cell surface was assessed in immunoblot studies to measure the steady-state 
levels of extensively glycosylated, mature CFTR (170 - 180 kDa band), which is indicative of CFTR exit 
from the endoplasmic reticulum, passage through the Golgi complex, and subsequent delivery to the 
cell surface. 
The selection of the missense CFTR mutations to be tested in the in vitro experiments performed was 
based on the presence of 10 or more alleles in the North American and European CF patient population 
or on a known molecular defect of interest. In addition to G551D, several other CF-causing CFTR 
mutations have been shown to produce a CFTR protein for which the predominant defect is a low 
channel open probability compared to normal CFTR. These include, G178R, G551S, G970R, G1244E, 
S1255P, and G1349D. Like G551D-CFTR, FRT cells expressing G178R-, G551S-, G970R-, G1244E-, 
S1255P-, and G1349D-CFTR had a low (< 10% of normal) level of baseline chloride transport in Ussing 
chamber studies. In addition to the previously described CFTR gating mutations, it is stated that the 
predominant defect associated with the S549N, S549R, and S1251N CFTR gene mutations is also a low 
channel open probability. 
According to the MAH, CF-causing CFTR gating mutations as a group shared the following common 
functional and clinical characteristics: 
•  Residual or normal amounts of CFTR at the cell surface; 
•  Minimal baseline levels of CFTR chloride transport (<10% normal) in vitro; 
•  A large fold (>10-fold) increase over baseline chloride transport in response to ivacaftor in vitro.

Based on genotype-phenotype studies correlating in vivo CFTR function with the severity of CF, an 
increase in CFTR-mediated chloride transport by ≥10% of normal CFTR chloride transport was used as 
an in vitro threshold to distinguish between levels of CFTR function that may be associated with less 
severe CF. 
The table below shows the in vitro effect of ivacaftor on chloride transport in Fischer rat thyroid (FRT) 
cells engineered to express the selected CFTR gating mutations. 
Table 2.  In vitro effects of ivacaftor on CFTR-gating mutations 
In vitro, ivacaftor stimulated chloride transport in cells expressing the G551S-CFTR mutant protein 
with a fold increase over baseline of 16.2 (the lowest fold change) while in cells expressing the 
G1244E-CFTR mutant the highest fold increase was achieved (i.e. 129.7). The difference between the 
two extreme values was 8-fold. Similar data with estimated EC50 values have been published4. Please 
note that for mutation S549R the fold increase over baseline value quoted in table above is 1050.0 
while in the study by Yu et al the value quoted is >20 which represents a more conservative approach.  
The MAH was requested to discuss if there exists a possible relationship between the observed 
obtained in vivo results (e.g. ΔFEV1 >5% improvement of baseline, decrease in CL, maximal CL 
concentration sweat etc.) and the in vitro restoration of the CTFR/chloride transport toward normal 
with ivacaftor. The analysis of the raw data does not show any apparent trend regardless of how the in 
vitro data of chloride transport is expressed, i.e. percent of normal or fold change over baseline. Table 
below show the data provided by the MAH in response to the above issue.

*n=3 available for the analysis of absolute change in sweat chloride 
A linear regression model was also applied to determine whether the absolute or relative change in 
either PPFEV1 or sweat chloride could be predicted by the absolute change in (in vitro) chloride 
transport after treatment with ivacaftor where the absolute change in chloride transport corresponds to 
the absolute difference before and after treatment with ivacaftor (both in % normal). The MAH justify 
the use of % normal (rather than the fold change) due to the fact that baseline values are usually only 
a few percent of normal for almost all mutations and therefore it was felt that fold change was not the 
most reliable and robust measure to express the effect of ivacaftor on chloride transport. This type of 
analysis did not show any significant linear correlation between the in vitro chloride transport and 
sweat chloride or PPFEV1 in vivo. The MAH states that the possibility that a relationship exists cannot 
be disproven by this limited data set. This is agreed, i.e. the lack of statistical significance does not 
mean that it does not exist. In addition, only linear relationship has been addressed. The MAH is 
encouraged to further explore an understanding of the relationships between in vitro and in vivo data.  
Literature5 shows that the gating mutations above considered cause protein alterations in the ATP 
binding pockets formed by the two NBDs required for normal CFTR channel gating (G551S, G1244E, 
S1255P, G1349D S549N, S549R, and S1251N) while the G178R and G970R CFTR mutations alter the 
intracellular cytoplasmic loops that are believed to link the ATP-driven conformational changes in the 
NBDs to the opening of the CFTR channel pore formed by the membrane spanning domains. 
Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutations may cause CF or be associated 
with CFTR-related disorders but they also may have no clinical consequences or have unknown or

uncertain clinical relevance. All of the non-G551D gating mutations above considered are missense 
mutations for which the clinical role is difficult to anticipate6.  
A search has been performed in the Clinical and Functional Translation of CFTR (CFTR2) website 
(www.CFTR2.org) on the non-G551D gating mutations characterised in vitro by the MAH as well as on 
the mutations identified in the second allele of the CFTR of patients enrolled in study 111. CFTR2 is a 
project that assembled clinical data and accompanying CFTR variants from individuals with cystic 
fibrosis enrolled in national registries and large clinical centres from 24 countries. By focusing on 
variants present in individuals with a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis ascertained by expert clinicians, the 
project used a ‘phenotype-driven’ approach to data collection7. 
The non-G551D gating mutations that have been characterised by the MAH are all missense mutations 
for which the CFTR2 website states that they “would cause CF”, i.e. they can cause CF when combined 
with another CF-causing mutation although the level of evidence does not seem to be the same for all 
of them, e.g. G551S is associated with borderline normal sweat electrolyte levels while for G178R and 
S549N CFTR2 it is stated that “The research published is insufficient to clearly determine whether or 
not the mutation is disease-causing”.  
It has to be noted that only two of the mutations identified in the second allele of the CFTR in patients 
enrolled in study 111 are missense mutations (L1077P and N1303K). They are also said to cause CF 
when combined with another CF-causing mutation. The remaining are nonsense (Y913X, G542X, 
Q1313X, R1158X), insertion/deletion (F508del, 2183AA->G, 2896insAG) and splice (621+1G->T, 
2789+5G->A) mutations that are known to significantly disrupt CFTR protein production and result in 
little or no functional CFTR protein in the cell.  
The identification of gating mutations as proposed by the MAH relies on in vitro work that may be not 
available for all the potential mutations as almost 2,000 variants have been reported in the CFTR 
coding and flanking sequences but only the functional importance of a small number is known. The 
MAH was initially proposing an indication for all gating mutations but the mutations that have been 
characterised in vitro and assessed in study 111 represent only a number of the possible gating 
mutations. Given the variable clinical consequences of missense mutations, the heterogeneity of the 
disease and the doubts raised on whether all of the non-G551D mutations above considered are 
disease-causing the MAH was requested to further address this issue. The MAH was also encouraged to 
develop an approach to keep treatment with ivacaftor only in those patients who really benefit from it, 
i.e. to develop a response-guided therapy. In response to CHMP Major Objection the MAH provided an 
extensive response and restricted the proposed indication, i.e. it was proposed to list the individual 
non-G551D gating mutations that have been studied in study 111.  
Regarding whether all the non-G551D gating mutations are cystic fibrosis-causing, two mutations were 
in particular questioned, i.e. G178R and S549N.  
The analysis of the CFTR2 data shows that there are 48 patients carrying the G178R mutation. Their 
average sweat chloride is 103 mmol/L, their PPFEV1 ranges from 28% to 107% (depending on age), 
63% are pancreatic insufficient and 66% are colonised by P aeruginosa. Six patients with this CFTR 
mutation were enrolled in study 111. Their baseline sweat chloride ranged from 90.5 to 121.5 mmol/L 
and their PPFEV1 between 42.9% and 118.7%. The subgroup analysis by non-G551D gating mutation 
showed that at week 8 of study 111 the mean (SD) absolute change in PPFEV1 was -2.4 (4.9) and 8.4 
(7.9) for the placebo (n=6)- and ivacaftor- (n=5) treated patients, respectively. Similarly, the mean

(SD) absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride was -5.42 (8.5) and -52.50 (13.5) mmol/L, 
respectively. Overall, it is believed that patients with the G178R-CFTR mutation can benefit from 
ivacaftor.  
As for S549N, the analysis of the CFTR2 data shows that there are 83 patients carrying this mutation. 
Their average sweat chloride is 99 mmol/L, their PPFEV1 ranges from 35% to 117% (depending on 
age), 90% are pancreatic insufficient and 52% are colonised by P aeruginosa. Six patients with this 
CFTR mutation were enrolled in study 111. Their baseline sweat chloride ranged from 89.0 to 118.0 
mmol/L, i.e., in the range of pathological values, although 89 mmol/L corresponds to the upper limit of 
residual CFTR function (from 40 to 89 mmol/L), and their PPFEV1 between 77.9% to 102.9%. The 
subgroup analysis by non-G551D gating mutation showed that at week 8 the mean (SD) absolute 
change in PPFEV1 was -8.9 (9.9) and 11.3 (9.8) for the placebo (n=6)- and ivacaftor (n=6)-treated 
patients, respectively. At week 8 the mean (SD) absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride was -
7.6 (10.8) and -74.3 (15.4) mmol/L, respectively. Overall, it is believed that patients with the S459N-
CFTR mutation can benefit from ivacaftor.  
In addition, the MAH acknowledged that two of the mutations considered are in the range of residual 
CFTR function, i.e. G551S and S1251N.  
Regarding G551S-CFTR mutation, there are data from 8 patients carrying this mutation in CFTR2. Their 
average sweat chloride is 63 mmol/L, their PPFEV1 ranges from 65% to 91% for patients above 20 
years old, 57% are pancreatic insufficient and 43% are colonised by P aeruginosa. The literature 
review of CFTR2 includes a reference to a paper describing three delta-F508/G551S compound 
heterozygous siblings with a mild CF phenotype, characterized by mild chronic pulmonary disease, 
pancreatic sufficiency and increased sweat chloride levels8. Overall, the available data suggest that 
patients with this genotype seem to have a mild disease phenotype. Two subjects were enrolled in 
study 111 with this mutation but only the results of one of them are available for analysis at week 8 in 
the placebo and ivacaftor groups. For both of them the second CFTR mutation was F508del. Their 
baseline sweat chloride ranged from 75.5 to 86.5 mmol/L. The mutation seems to be disease-causing 
but the evidence of efficacy of ivacaftor is weak in that only two patients were enrolled in study 111 
and just one analysed. The only strong proof of activity of ivacaftor is found in the mean absolute 
change in sweat chloride of -68 mmol/L in the ivacaftor-treated patient versus -11.50 mmol/L in the 
placebo-treated patient. The analysis of the remaining endpoints assessed, i.e. PPFEV1, BMI and CFQ-
R respiratory domain shows very modest improvements except in the CFQ-R respiratory domain. 
However, the limitation imposed by the single patient assessed precludes drawing firm conclusions.  
As for S1251N, the analysis of CFTR2 shows that there are 69 patients with the same genotype 
(S1251N/F508del) as the one of patients enrolled in study 111. Their average sweat chloride is 91 
mmol/L, the PPFEV1 for those older than 20 years old ranges from 34% to 91%, 87% are pancreatic 
insufficient and 54% are colonised by P aeruginosa. When considering all patients with the S1251N-
CFTR mutation in CFTR2 data are available for 85 patients with an average sweat chloride of 89 
mmol/L, a PPFEV1 ranging between 35% to 95%, 83% of them are pancreatic insufficient and 55% are 
colonised by P aeruginosa. Eight patients with this non-G551D gating mutation were enrolled in study 
111. Their baseline sweat chloride ranged from 79.5 to 97.5 mmo/L (excluding the single patient with 
a normal sweat chloride value at baseline). The analysis by non-G551D gating mutation supports the 
efficacy of ivacaftor in this mutation. Lung disease in the patient with a normal baseline sweat chloride 
of 12 mmol/L can be mainly attributed to concomitant comorbidity, i.e. hyperimmunoglobulin E 
syndrome.

The information currently included in SmPC section 5.1 regarding the mechanism of action is rather 
unspecific, therefore an update of this section of the SmPC is proposed. This is supported by the CHMP 
but the proposal of the MAH, reflecting the artificial conditions in which the in vitro experiments were 
performed, was felt to convey information that was not useful for physicians. As a consequence, this 
subsection has been only slightly amended to reflect the current lack of demonstration of relationship 
between in vitro and in vivo data. 
Antibacterial activity 
Ivacaftor has a quionoline ring in its molecule and has been shown to have direct antibacterial activity 
against Gram-positive bacteria9. The MAH was requested to discuss whether the effect of ivacaftor may 
be mediated by its antibacterial activity. 
Ivacaftor has antibacterial activity against gram-positive microorganisms, particularly S aureus which is 
one of the main pathogens colonising the lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis, specially the youngest 
ones. It is somehow reassuring that no effect has been shown (in vitro) against P aeruginosa.  
Data from the GOAL (G551D, observational) study10, a prospective, multi-centre observational study in 
CF subjects with the G551D-CFTR mutation, conducted by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation in the United 
States, showed that patients treated with ivacaftor had reduced P aeruginosa infections. The reduction 
in P aeruginosa infection suggests a positive effect from ivacaftor. However, according to the MAH this 
effect is judged to be independent of any direct antibacterial activity since ivacaftor was not shown to 
impact gram negative bacteria. The data from the GOAL study are reassuring. 
Although the MAH does not believe that the effect of ivacaftor is mediated by its (in vitro) antibacterial 
activity this cannot be completely excluded with the data provided. 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
A population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model has been developed to describe ivacaftor 
plasma concentrations and the effects observed on percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one 
second (PPFEV1) and on sweat chloride that includes data from different studies in healthy volunteers 
and patients with cystic fibrosis and a gating mutation in one allele of the CFTR gene. This model builds 
up on the prior model, i.e. data from Part 1 of study 111 have been added to update the model and its 
objectives are mainly descriptive in terms of ivacaftor pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. 
Ivacaftor PK was described by a 2-compartment model with zero-order delivery to the absorption 
compartment and subsequent first-order absorption. Body weight was the most important predictor of 
ivacaftor disposition while gender, patient status (CF versus non-CF subject), age, and formulation did 
not account for variability in ivacaftor PK in a clinically meaningful manner after accounting for weight. 
Ivacaftor CL/F was 39% and 131% of the reference value of 18.8 L/h for the typical 20 kg and 100 kg 
subject, respectively, when compared to the reference subject (70 kg). 
A pop PK model has been developed for ivacaftor but not for metabolites M1 and M6 since lower M1 
concentrations were observed in Study 111 when compared to previous studies. This difference 
prompted the MAH to search for the cause of this difference and was attributed to the actual content of 
the reference Lot H04966-106 being only 36% of the stated value. This reference standard was used in

some of the previous studies and due to this error, M1 concentrations were overestimated. It is unclear 
whether only Lot H04966-106 was the only one where actual and nominal contents differed several 
fold or other lots are also involved. Currently the misreporting of M1 concentrations is not a major 
concern given that the true M1 concentrations are lower than the reported ones. However, the overall 
clinical implications of this finding as well as possible changes needed in the Product Information of 
Kalydeco should be addressed outside the scope of the current procedure.  
M1 has not been incorporated into the population-PK model but the MAH indicate that the population-
PK model will be updated with accurate M1 values from all available studies to allow modelling of the 
metabolites to proceed for the ongoing study in subjects with CF who have a gating mutation age 2 to 
5 years. Updating the model as proposed is endorsed. Current model-based simulations and 
predictions should be viewed with caution. Overall, this issue is considered not to have a major impact 
on the current application, but in a separate procedure the MAH is expected to address the 
bioanalytical issue of M1 and the changes needed in the SmPC to accurately reflect the available data. 
For the covariate model the approach taken has been to predefine covariate-parameter relationships 
based on exploratory graphics, scientific interest and mechanistic plausibility of prior knowledge rather 
than using a stepwise hypothesis testing. According to the Modelling and Simulation Plan of analysis 
the following covariates were pre-defined to be included: sex, weight, age, drug formulation, genotype 
(G551D gating mutation vs. non-G551D gating mutations), creatinine clearance and race. Since the 
majority of subjects were Caucasian with little representation in other race categories, race was not 
finally considered as a descriptor in the covariate model. This is acceptable. However, creatinine 
clearance and, most importantly, genotype have not been incorporated into the model. Creatinine 
clearance was inadvertently included in the Modelling and Simulation Plan for study 111. Given the 
small contribution of renal mechanisms to ivacaftor clearance and the fact that most of the included 
participants had creatinine clearance values >80 mL/min it is considered that there is no need to test 
creatinine clearance as a covariate. This is acceptable. Genotype was also included as a possible 
covariate in the Modelling and Simulation Plan. However, it was not incorporated for evaluation in the 
population-PK model. Rather, the individual estimates of ivacaftor CL/F were used to calculate the 
mean CL/F in G551DCFTR vs. non- G551D-CFTR gating mutations (19.2 L/hr vs. 15.4 L/hr, 
respectively) and to conclude that there does not seem to be differences between both groups. As 
already stated, the current model should not be used to support dosing recommendations and model-
based simulations should be viewed with caution. 
The pop PK/PD report state that PK parameter values for ivacaftor were similar in CF subjects in study 
111 compared to previous studies. There seems to be a lack of consistency when deciding the final 
covariates to be kept into the model, i.e. the final model includes some covariates in spite of the fact 
that they are expected not to have any impact into the model. Additional inconsistencies already 
highlighted at the time of MAA is that being body weight one of the main factors explaining variability 
in ivacaftor clearance dosing recommendations for Kalydeco are based on age rather than on body 
weight. In the case of children aged 6 years to less than 12 years the updated model again predicts 
that systemic exposure in these children is higher than in adults. Therefore, the same measures that 
have been adopted in the Risk Management Plan for children with a G551D mutation should be applied 
to children with a non-G551D-CFTR gating mutation.  
Pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic models were constructed to describe the concentration–response 
relationships for PPFEV1 and sweat chloride. Instead of using FEV1 (L) as a PD endpoint, the current 
model uses PPFEV1. The prior PD model was used as a starting point for the PPFEV1 analysis. The 
typical estimates (90% CI) of PD model parameters for the reference covariate effects (male, 18 
years) were 73.9 (69.3, 76.9) for E0, 0.124 (0.104, 0.147) for Emax, and 74.2 ng/mL (37.1, 147) for 
Kalydeco II-09  
EMA/CHMP/360053/2014 
Page 18/90 
 
 
 
 
 
EC50. The Emax estimate of 0.124 (0.104, 0.147) translates to an absolute increase in PPFEV1 of 9.16% 
(7.69%, 10.9%) from the population mean baseline of 73.9%. Age was the most important predictor 
for PPFEV1 at baseline, but instead of using age as a continuous variable it has been categorised into 
less than 18 years old and equal or older than 18 years old on grounds that PPFEV1 would be different 
in children below 18 years of age versus adult patients. The MAH stated that since the decline in 
PPFEV1 from 6 to 17 years was followed by a more rapid decline after 18 years of age, and the decline 
in the random effect for baseline PPFEV1 changed between 16 and 20 years of age, two separate 
relationships including both a continuous and a categorical (<18 years or ≥18 years) variable were 
incorporated into the PK/PD model to describe age effects on baseline PPFEV1. This selection was 
considered to be consistent with standard clinical age categorization. However, no mathematical data 
have been provided or clinical reasoning discussed to support the decision. The issue can be 
considered solved but the model should not be used to support dosing recommendations and model-
based simulations should be viewed with caution. The MAH was asked using the pop-PK/PD model 
parameter estimates to predict the PPFEV1 improvements by different age groups such as 6, 8, 10, 12, 
14, 16, 18, 20, 30 years and with different baseline PPFEV1 values such as 50%, 60%, 70%, 75% 
80%, 85% and 90%. The requested predictions were provided. However, given the lack of robustness 
of the model they should be viewed with caution. 
The sweat chloride base model was identical to the prior model, consisting of an Emax model with 
estimated baseline, and an effect compartment. The typical estimates (90% CI) of PD model 
parameters for the reference covariate effects (male, 18 years) were 102 mM (100,103) for E0, -51.4 
mM (-56.2, -46.2) for Emax, 92.9 ng/mL (57.3, 143) for EC50, and 0.0213 h-1 (0.0157, 0.0266) for KE0. 
Females had an 18% increase in sweat chloride Emax when compared to males, translating to an Emax 
value of -60.1 (-64.0, -56.5) mM for females.  
The pop PK/PD modelling report states that for both PPFEV1 and sweat chloride, model runs were 
performed where a separate Emax or EC50 value was estimated for study 111 subjects (non-G551D 
gating mutation) and that these estimates were comparable to those obtained from G551D subjects. 
The information provided about intermediate models supports the lack of differences regardless of the 
underlying type of mutation, i.e. G551D or non-G551D gating mutations; however, it is not conclusive 
due to the limited sample size and range of exposure in study 111. 
The stated objectives of the present model were not intended to give support to dose selection, 
something that certainly seems difficult with the model developed that shows differences in potency of 
the drug. In this regard, EC90 (90%CI) values for PPFEV1 and sweat chloride values from the current 
analysis are 668 ng/mL (334, 1323) and 836 ng/mL (516,1287), respectively while EC90 values from 
the prior analysis for FEV1 (L) and sweat chloride were 423 ng/mL (45.3, 865) and 900 ng/mL (766, 
1008). The EC90 value for PPFEV1 is higher in the current analysis relative to that of the prior model for 
FEV1. The MAH has explained that such differences may be due to (i) inherent differences in the 
endpoints: FEV1 is an absolute measure, with a fixed upper limit dictated by lung size and baseline 
lung defect volume, but PPFEV1 has no upper limit and is based on a comparison to a population 
average for gender, age, and height; (ii) and difficulties to properly estimate it in the model due to the 
limited data in the lower exposure range. This answer further reinforces the limitations of the current 
pop PK-PD model. 
The MAH has recognised that a precise PK threshold has not been identified as being predictive of 
clinical response in patients (e.g. Cmin > EC90). The MAH proposed to remove information on EC50 and 
EC90 from the SmPC. MAH’s proposal to delete the information on pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic 
relationship in section 5.2 of the SmPC is agreed.

Overall, the MAH’s responses in relation to the pop PK-PD model make it clear that a better 
characterisation of ivacaftor PK in patients (including rich sampling) is highly desirable and that the 
PK/PD model lacks robustness in that: 
•  M1 concentrations cannot be incorporated into the model for the time being.  
• 
• 
The covariate modelling approach is questionable.  
The EC90 values estimated by the model are imprecise and not useful for physicians or for 
supporting the dose selection. 
•  Median Cmin which was previously considered the target PK parameter for efficacy is no longer 
considered as such due to differences in drug potency seen when the model was updated with data 
from study 111.  
No dose-response studies have been performed given the rarity of patients who have non-G551D CFTR 
gating mutations. The MAH considers that similar in vitro potency of ivacaftor towards non-G551D 
gating mutations relative to G551D and the efficacy and safety results obtained in studies 102 and 103 
supported evaluation of 150 mg q12h in study 111. In addition, it is postulated that ivacaftor PK is 
similar in healthy subjects and patients with CF, and therefore differences in PK are not anticipated 
between patients with other gating mutations relative to patients with the G551D mutation.  
In section 5.2 of the SmPC most pharmacokinetic data correspond to healthy volunteers. The MAH was 
asked to provide tabular quantitative information of the following PK parameters Cmax, Cmin, AUC, t1/2, 
Cl and V calculated by non-compartmental methods in healthy volunteers, and sorted by study (studies 
102 and 103 in patients with a G551D mutation versus study 111) and by age group (6 to less than 12 
years old, 12 to less than 18 years old and 18 years old and older). The MAH has provided the 
requested data (see table below). The PK parameters were calculated by means of non-compartmental 
analysis. Since studies 102, 103 and 111 did not include extensive sampling, t1/2 and Vz/F could not be 
calculated, and Ctrough instead of Cmin is reported. Moreover, Cmax is an approximate value due to the 
limited sample points during the absorption phase in the above mentioned studies.  
Table 4.  Mean (SD) Steady-State Ivacaftor PK Parameters in CF Subjects and Healthy Subjects 
following VX_770 150 mg q12h 
According to the MAH the above PK parameters indicate similar levels of exposure in G551D and non-
G551D adult CF subjects relative to healthy adult subjects. Exposure is also similar in adolescents and 
children with a G551D-CFTR mutation relative to those with a non-G551D gating mutation. This is 
agreed. However, it should also be pointed out that ivacaftor systemic exposure in children 6 to 12 
year old with either a G551D- or non-G551D-CFTR gating mutation is approximately 2-fold higher than 
in adults. This makes it desirable that further dosing recommendations (in particular for children below

5 years old) are aimed at targeting adult exposures taking into account that Cmin is no longer the 
target PK parameter for efficacy.  
Based  on  the  results  discussed  above  the  information  in  SmPC  section  5.2  has  been  updated  with  a 
general  statement.  Detailed  quantitative  data  are  to  be  included  when  the  bioanalytical  issue  of  M1 
overestimation in prior studies is resolved. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Only limited pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic data have been provided with this submission. 
Analytical methods used for the measurement of ivacaftor and metabolites M1 and M6 in 
plasma 
As requested the MAH has submitted the final bioanalytical study report J094 in which the calibration 
curve and quality control data met the pre-specified acceptance criteria for all batches of samples 
analysed. Lower concentrations of M1 were detected in study 111 as compared to previous studies. 
The apparent difference in M1 exposure has been attributed to the implementation of a new M1 
reference standard lot. The composition of an older M1 reference standard lot used for analysis of 
samples in the original submission has been found to be significantly lower than originally measured, 
resulting in an overestimation of M1 concentrations in the studies supporting the original submission. 
The overall clinical implications of this finding as well as possible changes needed in the Product 
Information of Kalydeco should be addressed outside the scope of the current procedure, but currently 
do not warrant an immediate regulatory action. The MAH has confirmed that the PK/PD model will be 
updated with data from studies where M1 has been accurately determined. This is endorsed. However, 
it has to be noted that whether the ratio ivacaftor:M1 is similar across healthy volunteers and patients 
with cystic fibrosis is still questionable. This is expected to be addressed in the planned separate 
procedure mentioned above. 
Population PK-PD modelling 
A population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model has been developed to describe ivacaftor 
plasma concentrations and the effects observed on percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one 
second (PPFEV1) and on sweat chloride that includes data from different studies in healthy volunteers 
and patients with cystic fibrosis and a gating mutation in one allele of the CFTR gene. This model builds 
up on the prior model, i.e. data from Part 1 of study 111 have been added to update the model and its 
objectives are mainly descriptive in terms of ivacaftor pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. The 
current model lacks robustness and should not be used to support dosing recommendations and 
model-based simulations should be viewed with caution. Indeed, the model was not intended to 
support dose selection for study 111 and its objectives are descriptive. 
Ivacaftor PK parameters calculated by non-compartmental analysis show that the systemic exposure to 
ivacaftor is similar in G551D and non-G551D adult CF patients relative to healthy adult subjects. 
Exposure is also similar in adolescents and children regardless of whether the CFTR mutation is G551D 
or non-G551D gating mutation. However, in patients with G551D- and non-G551D-CFTR gating 
mutations, the exposure to ivacaftor is almost 2-fold higher in children 6-12 years old relative to that 
seen in adults. This information is reflected in section 5.2 of the SmPC for the time being as a general 
statement.

Interactions with Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide 1B1 and 1B3 
Metabolite M6 has been shown in vitro to be a substrate for the transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. 
In addition, metabolites M1 and M6 have been shown in vitro to be inhibitors of both transporters 
OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Conclusions about potential clinical relevant DDIs should be based on 
comparison with a 25-fold unbound hepatic inlet concentration according to the Guideline on 
Investigations of Drug Interactions (EMA/CHMP/EWP/125211/2010). 
The IC50 values for OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 inhibition by M1 were 12.1 μM and 39.8 μM and for M6 
were 23.9 μM and 86.5 μM, respectively (use IC50 instead Ki was found acceptable as for competitive 
inhibition if Km >> S, the IC50 values are expected to be approximately Ki). New calculations for the 
unbound Cmax or Iin, max resulted in values of 0.0713 μM and 0.0578 μM, respectively. The multiplication 
by a factor of 25 leads to unbound Cmax or Iin, max values of 1.78 μM and 1.45 μM. Since the 25-fold 
unbound hepatic inlet concentrations for both the M1 and M6 metabolites are much lower than IC50 
values, clinically relevant interactions are not expected between ivacaftor or its metabolites and 
OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 substrates. 
In vitro data on the effect of ivacaftor in non-G551D gating mutations 
In vitro data on the effect of ivacaftor in non-G551D gating mutations that are the subject of the 
present submission initially were not re-discussed by the MAH. The MAH was requested to provide a 
comprehensive review of the mechanism of action of ivacaftor in CFTR gating mutations that also 
includes a discussion on its antibacterial properties and the role that this property may have in 
treatment outcomes in patients. Information in section 5.1 on ivacaftor mechanism of action was 
proposed to be updated according to currently available data, but for the reasons discussed above it 
has amended only slightly to indicate the lack of demonstration of a relationship between  in vitro and 
in vivo data. 
Regarding the antibacterial properties of ivacaftor it has been shown that in vitro ivacaftor has 
antibacterial activity against gram-positive microorganisms, particularly S aureus which is one of the 
main pathogens colonising the lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis, specially the youngest ones. It is 
somehow reassuring that no effect has been shown (in vitro) against P aeruginosa. The data from the 
GOAL study are also reassuring. Although the MAH do not believe that the effect of ivacaftor is 
mediated by its (in vitro) antibacterial activity this cannot be completely excluded with the data 
provided. 
Information obtained from the CFTR2 website suggests that the evidence supporting that all of the 
non-G551D gating mutations assessed in study 111 are disease-causing is inconsistent. However, 
based on the reanalysis of this information and the subgroup analysis by non-G551D gating mutation it 
is concluded that there is no reason to exclude any of the non-G551D gating mutations based on these 
arguments. Nevertheless, whether ivacaftor is equally beneficial in all gating mutations has been 
questioned based on the in vitro and in vivo results presented. The main consequence is that the 
initially proposed unrestricted indication covering all non-G551D gating mutations could not be 
accepted, which was reflected in a Major Objection pertaining to clinical efficacy. In response to the 
CHMP objection the MAH proposed to restrict the indication to those mutations that have been 
investigated in study 111. Whether all the CFTR-mutations studied in this trial can be included in the 
indication is addressed in the section on clinical efficacy.

2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The current PK/PD model lacks robustness and should not be used to support dosing recommendations 
while model-based simulations should be viewed with caution.  
Non-compartmental analysis shows that ivacaftor pharmacokinetics is similar in patients with cystic 
fibrosis and healthy volunteers and also similar regardless of whether the underlying mutation is a 
G551D or a non-G551D gating mutation. However, in patients with G551D- and non-G551D-CFTR 
gating mutations, the exposure to ivacaftor is almost 2-fold higher in children 6-12 years old relative to 
that seen in adults. 
Metabolite M6 has been shown in vitro to be a substrate for the transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. 
In addition, metabolites M1 and M6 have been shown in vitro to be inhibitors of both transporters 
OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. However, since the 25-fold unbound hepatic inlet concentrations for both the 
M1 and M6 metabolites are much lower than IC50 values, clinically relevant interactions are not 
expected between ivacaftor or its metabolites and OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 substrates. 
The clinical implications and possible changes in the Product Information of Kalydeco related to the 
finding that M1 concentrations were overestimated in prior studies of ivacaftor need to be addressed 
outside the current procedure as in study 111 the analysis for M1 is acceptable.  
An in vitro antibacterial activity of ivacaftor against Gram positive microorganisms has been observed, 
and contribution of this activity to the mechanism of action cannot be completely excluded based on 
the data available. 
Doubts were raised regarding whether all of the gating mutations characterised in vitro are cystic 
fibrosis-causing. In particular, G178R- and S549N-CFTR mutations have been questioned as being 
disease-causing. As for G551S-CFTR mutation the average sweat chloride of patients carrying this 
mutation in CFTR2 is 63 mmol/L (a borderline value). However, based on responses provided by the 
MAH, it is agreed that all non-G551D mutations assessed in study 111 can be considered as disease-
causing although the available evidence supporting this is variable and stronger for some mutations 
than for others. The proposed indication was, however, amended from an unrestricted one to a more 
specific one where the individual mutations are listed (please see further discussion in the section on 
clinical efficacy). 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response studies 
No dose-response studies have been performed given the rarity of patients who have non-G551D-CFTR 
gating mutations. The MAH considered that similar in vitro potency of ivacaftor towards non-G551D 
gating mutations relative to G551D and the efficacy and safety results obtained in studies 102 and 103 
supported evaluation of 150 mg q12h in study 111. In addition, it is argued that ivacaftor PK is similar 
in healthy subjects and patients with CF, and therefore differences in PK are not anticipated between 
patients with other gating mutations relative to patients with the G551D mutation.  
As previously discussed, the systemic exposure to ivacaftor is similar in G551D and non-G551D adult 
CF patients relative to healthy adult subjects. Exposure is also similar in adolescents and children 
regardless of whether the CFTR mutation is G551D or non-G551D gating mutation. However, in 
patients with G551D- and non-G551D-CFTR gating mutations, the exposure to ivacaftor is almost 2-
fold higher in children 6-12 years old relative to that seen in adult patients. This information is included 
in section 5.2 of the SmPC.

2.4.2.  Main study 
Study 111 
The pivotal study for the proposed extension to the indication of Kalydeco is study VX12-770-111 
(study 111), a phase 3, two-part, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study with 
an open-label period to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ivacaftor in subjects with cystic fibrosis who 
have a non-G551D-CFTR gating mutation. The crossover period was immediately followed by a 16-
week open-label period to provide efficacy and safety results for a total of 24 weeks. This submission is 
based on the double-blind crossover period data (Treatment Period 1 through Treatment Period 2) 
assessing the primary efficacy endpoint. A schematic of the study design is provided in the figure 
below.  
Figure 1.  Schematic of Phase 3 Study Design of Ivacaftor in Subjects with a Non-G551D Gating 
Mutation 
Based on the time frame of response in studies 102 and 103 of CF patients with a G551D-CFTR 
mutation, the 8-week duration of the placebo-controlled treatment periods was expected to be 
sufficient to demonstrate a treatment effect and pattern of response in CF patients with a gating 
mutation other than G551D. The 16-week Open-label Period in Part 2 will allow for the assessment of 
ivacaftor effect over a 24-week period.

Endpoints in Part 2 of the study 
Primary Endpoint was absolute change from baseline in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 
1 second (PPFEV1) through 24 weeks of treatment. 
Secondary Endpoints were:

concentration-time data 
Pulmonary exacerbations 
•  Change from baseline in non-respiratory domains of the CFQ-R through 24 weeks of treatment

Sweat chloride values were analysed at a central laboratory. It has been clarified that collection of 
sweat followed a standardized procedure and that study 111 site personnel were trained and qualified 
on this procedure by approved trainers. Collection of sweat samples were performed using a collection 
device, the Macroduct Model 3700 Sweat Collection System. The analytic measurement range for the 
sweat chloride assay was 10 to 160 mM/L. If samples fell outside that range, the result was reported 
as <10 mM/L or >160 mM/L, as appropriate. 
Sample size 
A minimum of 20 subjects up to a maximum of approximately 40 subjects were planned. A sample size 
of 20 subjects was expected to provide sufficient power for the mean change from baseline in PPFEV1. 
Table below presents the estimated study power for detecting different treatment effect sizes between 
ivacaftor and placebo in the change in PPFEV1, assuming 20 (minimum possible enrolment) or 40 
(maximum possible enrolment) subjects. An SD of 8% and within-subject SD of 5% were assumed in 
the calculation. Enrolment of approximately 40 subjects allowed for a larger number of subjects with 
each of the non-G551D-CFTR gating mutations to be included.

Randomisation 
Subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive 1 of 2 Treatment Sequences during the Treatment Periods: 
• 
• 
Treatment Sequence 1: ivacaftor in Treatment Period 1 → washout period → ivacaftor-matched 
placebo in Treatment Period 2 
Treatment Sequence 2: ivacaftor-matched placebo in Treatment Period 1 → washout period → 
ivacaftor in Treatment Period 2. 
In addition, patients were stratified for age (6 to 11 years, 12 to 17 years, and ≥18 years) and FEV1 
severity (<70%, ≥70% to ≤90%, and >90%). 
The randomization codes were generated by Vertex or a designated vendor. To protect the study blind 
and maintain the scientific integrity of the study data, 3 biostatisticians were involved in the 
randomization process: a study biostatistician who was blinded to the actual treatment code, an 
unblinded biostatistician not associated with the study, and an unblinded quality check (QC) 
biostatistician. The study biostatistician created the randomization specification and dummy 
randomization codes, which were reviewed and approved by the unblinded biostatistician. After 
approval of the dummy codes, the unblinded biostatistician generated the final randomization list. The 
QC unblinded biostatistician reviewed and approved the final randomization list.  
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind study. The subjects and all site personnel, including the investigator and the 
study monitor, were to remain blinded to treatment assignments until database lock. The MAH’s study 
team remained blinded to treatment assignments until all subjects completed Part 1 of the study, and 
with the exception of the following:

but remained blinded to treatment assignment. 
A single member of Vertex DMPK Sample Management, independent from the study team, was 
unblinded, having access to the IVRS/IWRS, for the purpose of assembling samples intended for 
bioanalysis. PK samples collected from placebo-dosed subjects were not analysed in this study. All 
other MAH’s DMPK laboratory personnel and MAH’s Quality Compliance Management personnel were 
blinded to the treatment assignment. A clinical pharmacologist not involved in the conduct of the study 
may have reviewed the bioanalytical results on an ongoing basis but remained blinded to the subjects’ 
identities (i.e., unique subject number and treatment assignment) in the clinical database.  
Subjects and their parent/caregiver should not have been informed of their study-related spirometry 
results during the Treatment Periods and the Open-label Period. 
Statistical methods 
The primary analysis of study 111 was based on data from Part 1.  
The following analysis sets were defined:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) – all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study 
medicine. All analyses of background data and efficacy data were based on the FAS.  
The Per Protocol Set (PPS) – all FAS subjects without major protocol violations (i.e., subjects who 
had not been determined to have violated protocol requirements). Major protocol violations were 
defined as violations that may have had a substantial impact on efficacy assessment. The criteria 
used for excluding subjects from the PPS were determined before the database lock and were 
documented. The PPS analyses were only performed for primary and selected secondary endpoints 
to provide supportive evidence for efficacy. 
The Complete Case Set (CCS) – all subjects in the FAS who completed both Treatment Periods in 
Part 1. The analyses of primary and selected secondary endpoints were based on the CCS, in 
addition to the FAS. 
The Safety Set – all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study medicine (i.e., ivacaftor or 
placebo). 
The primary analysis for the primary efficacy variable (absolute change in PPFEV1) was based on a 
mixed effects models for repeated measures (MMRM). The model included the absolute change from 
Kalydeco II-09  
EMA/CHMP/360053/2014 
Page 29/90 
 
 
 
 
 
the baseline in each Treatment Period as the dependent variable, with sequence, treatment, period, 
and visit within period as fixed effects, study baseline PPFEV1 and age as covariates, and subject 
nested within sequence as the random effect. In the model, visit was treated as a class variable. 
Compound symmetry covariance matrix was assumed for the repeated measurements on the same 
subject within each period. This model assumed equal variances of the repeated measures and equal 
covariances between each pairs of measures within each subject. Denominator degrees of freedom for 
the F-test for fixed effects were estimated using the Kenward-Roger approximation. With a mixed-
effects model as the primary analysis model based on maximum likelihood estimation and assuming 
that data are missing at random conditional on fixed and random effects, no imputation of missing 
data were done. 
The main effect of treatment obtained from the model was interpreted as the average treatment effect 
(effect of ivacaftor) across all post-baseline visits within the treatment period. The estimated mean 
treatment effect, a 95% confidence interval (CI), and a 2-sided P value were provided. 
Sensitivity analyses including first-order autoregressive covariance in an otherwise identical model to 
the primary analysis, Wilcoxon signed ranksum, and analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) were 
implemented for primary variable. 
With a mixed-effects model as the primary analysis model, no imputation of missing data was done. 
However, the sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the impact of missing efficacy evaluations 
on the treatment effect estimated through a mixed-effects repeated measures model: 
• 
LOCF-based MMRM analysis 
•  Worst-case based MMRM analysis 
•  Dropout reason-based imputation MMRM analysis:  
The primary analysis was repeated based on the PPS and CCS. No sensitivity analysis was performed 
based on the PPS and CCS. 
A carryover effect was not expected since the Washout Period occurred between Treatment Period 1 
and Treatment Period 2. However, to provide a back-up analysis in the case when there was a strong 
carryover effect, analysis based on MMRM using data from Treatment Period 1 only was conducted. 
The model included absolute change from baseline in PPFEV1 as the dependent variable, treatment 
(ivacaftor versus placebo) and visit (Weeks 2, 4, and 8) as fixed effects, subject as a random effect, 
with adjustment for the continuous baseline value of age and PPFEV1. In the model, visit was treated 
as a class variable and a compound symmetry covariance matrix was assumed to model the within-
subject variability. This analysis was based on the FAS. 
In addition, change from baseline in PPFEV1 at Week 8 was categorized by the following rules: ≥5% or 
<5%, ≥7.5% or <7.5%, ≥10% or <10% and summarized as categorical variables. 
Due to small sample size, subgroup analyses were primarily descriptive in nature and consisted of 
summary statistics. These subgroup analyses were used to examine the ability to generalize the 
findings across subgroups. If an adequate sample size (i.e., ≥5 subjects in both treatment groups) was 
available in any of the subgroups described below, model-based analysis similar to that described for 
the primary analysis was conducted within the subgroup. Minimally, summary statistics were provided 
by treatment group at each visit. 
The following subgroups were used: 
•  Age Group at Baseline (6 to 11 [inclusive], 12 to 17 [inclusive], and ≥18 years) 
Kalydeco II-09  
EMA/CHMP/360053/2014 
Page 30/90 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
PPFEV1 Severity at Baseline (<70%, 70% to 90% [inclusive], and >90% of the predicted value) 
•  Geographic Region (North America and Europe) 
•  Sex (Female and Male) 
• 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P aeruginosa) infection status at Baseline (Yes and No) 
All subgroup summaries were provided only for the FAS. 
For Part 1, the safety analysis was based on the set of data associated with the period from signing of 
informed consent through the end of the Treatment Period 2. Summaries were by treatment received. 
The overall safety profile of ivacaftor versus placebo was assessed in terms of incidence of treatment-
emergent adverse event (TEAEs), clinical laboratory values (haematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, 
and coagulation studies), ECGs, vital signs. Safety variables were analysed based on the Safety Set. 
Only descriptive analysis of safety was performed (i.e., no formal between-treatment statistical testing 
was performed). 
To control the overall type I error rate at 0.05, the primary endpoint and key secondary endpoints 
were tested in sequence as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
Test 1: The primary efficacy endpoint was tested at significance level α = 0.05. 
Test 2: If a statistically significant result was obtained from Test 1, the change from baseline in 
BMI through Week 8, and change from baseline in sweat chloride through Week 8 were tested 
using Hochberg’s step-up procedure at significance level α = 0.05. 
Test 3: If a statistically significant result was obtained from Test 2, change from baseline in CFQ-R 
respiratory domain score through Week 8 was tested.

Three subjects discontinued the study before Treatment Period 2; their genotypes were 
G551S/DELF508, G178R/DELF508 and G970R/2789+5G>A. Therefore, a total of 38 subjects who 
received ivacaftor treatment and 37 subjects who received placebo were evaluated for efficacy.

One patient per treatment sequence discontinued the intervention for “Other reasons”, e.g. due to the 
need to extend the Washout Period (“washout extended due to antibiotic usage” and “per sponsor, did 
not qualify to continue”). An additional patient was lost to follow-up. 
Recruitment 
Study Part 1 was initiated on 11 July 2012 (date first eligible subject signed informed consent form) 
and study Part 1completion was on 31 May 2013 (date last subject completed the last visit in Part 1).  
Subjects were randomized at 8 study sites in the US, 3 in France and one in Belgium. The number of 
patients randomised was 22, 8 and 9 respectively. 
Conduct of the study 
The study protocol was amended 4 times by the time of the data cut for the Part 1 clinical study 
report. The final protocol (Version 5.0) is dated 05 December 2012. 
Protocol Amendment 1 
Version 2.0 of Protocol VX12-770-111, dated 17 February 2012, was the first amendment of the 
protocol (replacing Version 1.0, dated 07 February 2012) and was finalized before study initiation on 
11 February 2012. 
The main change implemented with this amendment related to the inclusion criterion for PPFEV1 that 
was changed from “40% to 90% inclusive for subjects age 12 years or older” and “40% to 105% 
inclusive for subjects age 6 to 11 years” to “FEV1 ≥40% predicted normal for age, sex, and height 
(Hankinson or Wang equations) at screening.” This was changed because the original PPFEV1 range 
was included in error. This was also clarified in the randomization strata. 
Protocol Amendment 2 
Version 3.0 of Protocol VX12-770-111, dated 21 March 2012, was the second amendment of the 
protocol. The principal changes included the following but are not limited to them: 
•  Due to recent preliminary finding of a dose-related increase in cataracts in juvenile rats identified 
in a nonclinical study conducted to support clinical studies in patients with cystic fibrosis younger 
than 2 years of age, an additional screening assessment of a comprehensive ophthalmologic 
examination was added for all subjects. 
•  Clarification about cycling antibiotic therapy was added. 
• 
The blinding process for the bioanalysis samples was updated. 
•  Clarification about collection of blood samples for the optional pharmacogenomic analysis was 
provided. 
Protocol Amendment 3 
Version 4.0 of Protocol VX12-770-111, dated 07 September 2012, was the third amendment of the 
protocol. The principal changes included the following but are not limited to them: 
•  Subjects who complete the Open-label Period and the Follow-up Visit and who choose not to enrol 
in the open-label treatment arm of Study VX12-770-112 (Study 112) were to be offered enrolment 
in the observational arm of Study 112. 
Kalydeco II-09  
EMA/CHMP/360053/2014 
Page 32/90 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
It was clarified that subjects who prematurely discontinue treatment and have received study drug 
for more than 4 weeks will be offered enrolment in the observational arm of Study 112. 
•  Ophthalmologic examinations were added as a safety endpoint for safety monitoring. 
•  Based on feedback from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics Development Network and in 
order to reduce the number of assessments, the sweat chloride test at screening was made 
optional for subjects who have sweat chloride values documented in their medical records or if it is 
not needed to establish eligibility. 
• 
The collection of qualitative microbiology culture samples at the Follow-up Visit was changed for 
subjects who prematurely discontinue treatment; if a sample was collected at the Early 
Termination Visit, the sample at the Follow-up Visit did not need to be collected. 
•  An assessment of a comprehensive ophthalmologic examination was added at the Week 36 Visit for 
subjects who are aged 6 to 11 years (inclusive) at the time of the Day 1 Visit. 
•  Unblinding of treatment assignments was changed specifying that the MAH’s study team will 
remain blinded until all subjects have completed Part 1 of the study. 
•  Handling of sweat samples by a central laboratory was clarified to align with current central 
laboratory practices. 
Protocol Amendment 4 
Version 5.0 of Protocol VX12-770-111, dated 05 December 2012, was the fourth amendment of the 
protocol. The principal change implemented with this amendment was related to the following: 
• 
It was corrected that the collection of sweat chloride at screening is required for subjects only if 
the value is not available in the subject’s medical records and the value is needed for the diagnosis 
of CF to fulfill inclusion criterion 1. Collection of sweat chloride at screening is not required, but is 
optional, for those subjects who have sweat chloride values documented in their medical records 
and it is not needed to establish eligibility. 
Changes to Planned Analyses 
The Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) was finalized before database lock and unblinding for this study and 
provides the final planned statistical analyses for Part 1. Difference from the last approved clinical 
study protocol (Version 5.0) included the following: 
•  Change covariance matrix from “unstructured covariance matrix” to “compound symmetry 
covariance matrix” for all MMRM models. This modification was made to ensure model 
convergence. 
Difference from the last approved statistical analysis plan (dated 13 June 2013) included the following: 
•  Removed the baseline of analysed variables from model covariates for all LMM models. This 
modification was made to align the statistical methodology with desired clinical interpretability. 
•  Removed ‘period’ from the negative binomial regression model for count variables. This 
modification was made to ensure model convergence. 
•  Before Part 1 data lock, analysis of the responder category <5 mmol/L or ≥5 mmol/L to evaluate a 
lower range of sweat chloride response was added, and the responder category <15 mmol/L or 
≥15 mmol/L was removed since any sweat chloride value that fell within this range would have 
Kalydeco II-09  
EMA/CHMP/360053/2014 
Page 33/90 
 
 
 
 
 
been reflected in the pre-specified responder categories <10 mmol/L or ≥10 mmol/L and <20 
mmol/L or ≥20 mmol/L. 
Baseline data 
The majority of subjects in both Treatment Sequences were White (75.0% in Treatment Sequence 1 
and 73.7% in Treatment Sequence 2) and of non-Hispanic or Latino ethnicity (75.0% in Treatment 
Sequence 1 and 68.4% in Treatment Sequence 2).  
The mean age was 23.8 years (range: 6 to 57) in Treatment Sequence 1 and 21.7 years (range: 6 to 
47) in Treatment Sequence 2; there were 19 subjects overall in the <18 years subgroup and 20 
subjects overall in the ≥18 years subgroup. Mean baseline sweat chloride values (overall 97.54 
mmol/L) and mean PPFEV1 at baseline (overall 78.3806%) were similar between the 2 Treatment 
Sequences. 
Baseline data for the FAS are provided in the table below.

Numbers analysed 
Table below shows the number of patients analysed per study population. 
Table 1. 
Subject Disposition, Part 1 
A total of 39 subjects were included in the Full Analysis Set (FAS) and the Safety Set: 20 subjects in 
Treatment Sequence 1 (ivacaftor in Treatment Period 1 → Washout → placebo in Treatment Period 2) 
and 19 subjects in Treatment Sequence 2 (placebo in Treatment Period 1 → Washout → ivacaftor in 
Treatment Period 2). Three subjects discontinued the study before Treatment Period 2 (2 subjects in 
Treatment Sequence 1 and 1 subject in Treatment Sequence 2); therefore, a total of 38 subjects who 
received ivacaftor treatment and 37 subjects who received placebo were evaluated for efficacy.  
Seven subjects in Treatment Sequence 1 and 3 subjects in Treatment Sequence 2 were excluded from 
the PPS due to major protocol violations. Of these, 8 subjects were excluded from the PPS for 
prohibited medications (i.e., ciprofloxacin, erythromycin ethylsuccinate, fluconazole, hypertonic saline, 
pentobarbital, prednisolone, Prozac); 1 subject was excluded because of the timing of his inhaled 
antibiotic use (TOBI) relative to study drug dosing on Day 1 (i.e., the subject was randomized at the 
end of an “on” cycle instead of an “off” cycle; and 1 subject (in Treatment Sequence 2) was excluded 
for study drug compliance <80% in Treatment Period 1. Three additional subjects were excluded from 
the PPS because they discontinued before Treatment Period 2 (2 subjects in Treatment Sequence 1; 1 
subject in Treatment Sequence 2). These three subjects were also excluded from the CCS because 
they discontinued before Treatment Period 2. 
A total of 18 subjects in each Treatment Sequence completed the full assigned duration of dosing. 
Outcomes and estimation  
Change from baseline in PPFEV1 
Primary efficacy variable was absolute change from baseline in PPFEV1 through Week 8 in each 
Treatment Period of Part 1. The table below shows the results of the absolute change from baseline in 
PPFEV1.  
Kalydeco II-09  
EMA/CHMP/360053/2014 
Page 40/90 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 10.  Absolute Change From Baseline in PPFEV1 by MMRM, Part 1, Full Analysis Set 
The mean absolute change from baseline in PPFEV1 through Week 8 by MMRM was greater during 
ivacaftor treatment (7.4868%) than during placebo treatment (-3.1912%). The estimated treatment 
difference (95% CI) for ivacaftor versus placebo was 10.6780% (7.2559, 14.1000). To assess potential 
carryover effects, treatment sequence and treatment period were included in the MMRM analysis of the 
primary efficacy endpoint. No significant effects of treatment sequence or treatment period were 
observed for the primary efficacy endpoint, suggesting no carryover effect. 
The consistency of treatment effect over study visits for the absolute change from baseline in PPFEV1 
by MMRM is presented in the table below. Statistically significant treatment differences (P <0.0001) 
were observed by Week 2 (first post-baseline time point assessed; 8.3142% [95% CI: 4.5109, 
12.1175]) and were sustained through Week 8 (13.7554% [95% CI: 9.9414, 17.5694]. 
Table 11.  Absolute Change From Baseline in PPFEV1 by MMRM, Consistency of Treatment Effect Over 
Visits, Part 1, Full Analysis Set 
To evaluate individual subject response to ivacaftor and placebo, a waterfall plot showing the absolute 
change from baseline in PPFEV1 at Week 8 by treatment is presented in the figure below.

Figure 2.  Waterfall Plot of Absolute Change From Baseline in PPFEV1 at Week 8 by Treatment, Part 1, 
Full Analysis Set 
The pattern of response suggests a clear distinction in treatment effect between ivacaftor and placebo. 
One subject had -19.573% decrease from baseline in PPFEV1 at Week 8 of ivacaftor treatment but this 
was attributed to an adverse event of infective pulmonary exacerbation that was not related to 
ivacaftor. 
The results of sensitivity analyses performed to assess the robustness of the primary analysis are 
shown in the table below.

Table 12.  Absolute Change From Baseline in PPFEV1, Sensitivity Analysis, Part 1, Full Analysis Set 
A supportive analysis based on MMRM using data only from Treatment Period 1 was conducted to 
explore if any carryover effect between Treatment Period 1 and Treatment Period 2 was evident. 
Results from the analysis are presented in the table below. 
Table 13.  Absolute Change From Baseline in PPFEV1 by MMRM, Treatment Period 1, Part 1, Full 
Analysis Set 
To provide additional supportive information, a responder analysis was conducted by categorizing the 
absolute change from baseline in PPFEV1 at Week 8 as ≥5% or <5%, ≥7.5% or <7.5%, ≥10% or 
<10%. Results are presented in the table below and show that only a single subject on placebo had a 
≥5% response compared to almost half the ivacaftor subjects. Over 40% of ivacaftor subjects 
responded by ≥10% after 8 weeks of treatment.

Table 14.  Responder Analysis of Absolute Change at Week 8 in PPFEV1 Part 1, Full Analysis Set 
Both the responder analysis of changes in PPFEV1 and the waterfall plot show that there were a 
number of patients who improved on placebo as well as some who deteriorated on ivacaftor. As a 
consequence, and upon request of the CHMP, the MAH provided the individual narratives of these 
patients. The narratives of seven patients were discussed. Two of these patients with genotypes 
S1251N/F508del and S549N/G542X had the maximum decreases during ivacaftor treatment, i.e. -
19.57 at week 8 and -6.97 at week 4, respectively. While it was stated that patient S1251N/F508del 
experienced a pulmonary exacerbation during ivacaftor treatment, the narrative of the patient with the 
genotype S549N/G542X did not offer any reasonable explanation for the observed decrease in FEV1 at 
week 4 but the patient experienced a much more pronounced decline in FEV1 during placebo-
treatment (-21.55). The remaining patients with genotypes S549R/F508del, G178R/L1077P, 
G1244E/F508del, S1255P/Q1313X and G970R/F508del had more limited decreases in lung function 
that ranged from -3.53 to -0.78. 
Change from baseline in BMI 
The mean absolute change from baseline in BMI at Week 8 (rate of change difference) by LMM is 
shown in the table below.

Mean (standard error, SE) changes from baseline in BMI at study visits across the Treatment Periods 
are presented in the figure below. Increases from baseline in BMI during treatment with ivacaftor were 
observed at Week 2 (first post-baseline time point assessed) and continued through Week 8. 
Figure 3.  Mean Absolute Change From Baseline in BMI (kg/m2) by Treatment, Part 1, Full Analysis 
Set 
BMI-for-age z-scores were calculated using the CDC growth chart for the 19 subjects who were 20 
years of age or younger. The mean absolute change from baseline in BMI-for-age z-score at Week 8 by 
LMM was greater during treatment with ivacaftor (0.2437 points) than during placebo treatment (-
0.0392 points) (see table below).

Statistically significant treatment differences were detected by Week 2 (first post-baseline time point 
assessed; -45.7161 mmol/L [95% CI: -53.9486, -37.4836]) and were sustained through Week 8 (-
49.6331 mmol/L [95% CI: -57.7951, -41.4711]) (see table below). 
Table 18.  Absolute Change From Baseline in Sweat Chloride (mmol/L) by MMRM, Consistency of 
Treatment Effect Over Visits, Part 1, Full Analysis Set 
A responder analysis was conducted by categorizing absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride 
values at Week 8 as ≥5 mmol/L or <5 mmol/L decrease, ≥10 mmol/L or <10 mmol/L decrease, and 
≥20 mmol/L or <20 mmol/L decrease. Results of this analysis are presented in the table below and 
show that the majority of subjects treated with ivacaftor who had ≥5 mmol/L decrease at Week 8 also 
had ≥20 mmol/L decrease at Week 8.

Table 19.  Responder Analysis of Absolute Change at Week 8 of Sweat Chloride (mmol/L), Part 1, Full 
Analysis Set 
The responder analysis of changes in sweat chloride at week 8 showed that three subjects had a >20 
mmol decrease in sweat chloride while on placebo and three subjects had <5 mmol decrease in sweat 
chloride while receiving ivacaftor. Upon request of the CHMP the MAH provided the individual 
narratives of these patients as well as waterfall plots of changes in sweat chloride at weeks 2, 4 and 8. 
The narratives provided for patients who had the smallest decreases in sweat chloride values while on 
treatment with ivacaftor showed that all of them carried the G970R-CFTR mutation. The analysis at 
week 8 of the mean absolute change in sweat chloride showed that in 3 out of the 4 patients enrolled 
in study 111 the reduction was below 5 mmol/L and between 5 and 20 mmol/L for the remaining 
patient. Similarly, the mean (SD) absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 at week 8 was 0.4 (3.7) 
and 2.6 (2.7) for placebo- and ivacaftor-treated patients. These results are comparatively inferior to 
those achieved by patients with other non-G551D gating mutations.  
The analysis of patients with a decrease in sweat chloride above 20 mmol/L while on placebo (i.e., 
higher than anticipated in the absence of an active treatment) did not suggest any specific pattern in 
terms of genotype. Narratives were provided for three patients with the following genotypes: 
G1349D/2183AA>G, S549R/F508del and S549N/N1303K. All three of them had pancreatic 
insufficiency.  
The patient with the genotype S549N/N1303K had at Day 1 (start of ivacaftor dosing) a sweat chloride 
of 118 mmol/L that after 8 weeks of treatment decreased to 31 mmol/L. At Week 12 (start of placebo 
dosing) his sweat chloride has increased to 105.5 mmol/L and decreased after 8 weeks of placebo 
treatment to 93.5 mmol/L.  
For the patient with the genotype S549R/F508del the amount of sweat chloride was not sufficient for 
analysis in most of the study visits where this measurement was performed. At baseline his sweat 
chloride was 105 mmol/L and 80 mmol/L during the run-in. The first day of ivacaftor-treatment the 
value was 103.5 mmol/L and after 8 weeks of placebo treatment it was 79.5 mmol/L. The lack of 
quantifiable sweat chloride amounts in most of the study visits precludes a clear interpretation of the 
data.

Patient with the genotype G1349D/2183AA>G had while on ivacaftor a decrease in sweat chloride from 
102 to 20.5 mmol/L. At week 12 (at the time of starting placebo treatment) his sweat chloride value 
had returned to the run in value prior study initiation. After 8 weeks of placebo treatment his sweat 
chloride dropped from 97 to 79 mmol/L. 
The waterfall plots provided of change in sweat chloride at weeks 2, 4, and 8 showed that the majority 
of the patients had a clear reduction in sweat chloride during ivacaftor treatment, i.e. almost all 
mutations consistently displayed a decrease in sweat chloride well above 20 mmol/L with ivacaftor. 
The only exceptions were G970R patients and single examples for S1251N subjects (see figure below).

Change from baseline in CFQ-R Respiratory Domain Score 
Four versions of the questionnaire were used: 3 in which the subject was interviewed or information 
was self-reported (Children of Ages 6 to 11 Years, Children of Ages 12 to 13 Years, and Adolescents 
and Adults) and 1 in which the subject's parent or caregiver was the respondent (Parents and 
Caregivers). Pooled questionnaire analyses were defined as all questionnaire versions except for the 
Parents and Caregivers version. 
Results of the mean absolute change from baseline in the respiratory domain score of the CFQ-R 
through Week 8 by MMRM and by questionnaire version are shown in the table below.

Table 20.  Absolute Change From Baseline in CFQ-R Respiratory Domain Score by MMRM, Part 1, Full 
Analysis Set 
The Children of Ages 12 to 13 Years version was not analysed with MMRM due to sample size 
constraints. 
A responder analysis was conducted by categorizing the absolute change from baseline in the pooled 
CFQ-R respiratory domain score through Week 8 as either ≥4 points or <4 points (which is considered 
the minimal clinically important difference). During treatment with ivacaftor, the majority of subjects 
(73.7%) had a ≥4 point increase from baseline in the CFQ-R respiratory domain score at Week 8; 
during treatment with placebo, the majority of subjects (70.3%) had <4 point increase from baseline. 
Tertiary Efficacy Variables 
Pulmonary exacerbations 
The number of events and model-based estimates of event rates of pulmonary exacerbations through 
Part 1 (Week 20) are summarized in table below.

Table 21.  Number of Pulmonary Exacerbations, Part 1, Full Analysis Set 
The mean (SD) duration of pulmonary exacerbations was lower during treatment with ivacaftor (2.92 
[6.027] days) compared with placebo (4.43 [9.487] days), but this difference was not statistically 
significant (P = 0.2166). 
Figure below presents the survival curves by treatment group for time-to-first pulmonary exacerbation 
in Part 1. Subjects received ivacaftor or placebo during the first 8 weeks of the curve; subsequent time 
points represent the Washout Period when subjects did not receive study drug. The Washout Period 
duration may have extended beyond 4 to 8 weeks for some subjects due to acute illness.

Change from baseline in height 
Change from baseline in height through Week 8 by LMM is summarized in the table below.  
Table 24.  Absolute Change From Baseline in Height (cm) by LMM, Part 1, Full Analysis Set  
Change from baseline in height through Week 8 was slightly greater during ivacaftor treatment 
(0.7709 cm) than during placebo treatment (0.5877 cm), but the treatment difference (95% CI) of 
0.1832 cm (-0.3807, 0.7471) was not statistically significant (P = 0.5207). The lack of statistical 
significance may be attributed, in the MAH’s opinion, to the short duration of study drug treatment 
(i.e., 8 weeks) and that the majority of subjects were adults (i.e., ≥18 years of age). 
For subjects 20 years of age or younger, height-for-age z-scores were calculated using the CDC growth 
chart. Change from baseline in height through 8 weeks of treatment is summarized by treatment group 
in the table below. The treatment difference (95% CI) of 0.0209 cm (-0.0607, 0.1024) was not 
statistically significant (P = 0.6130).

Change from baseline in qualitative microbiological cultures 
Shift from period baseline in qualitative microbiology cultures from throat swabs and sputum samples 
is presented by treatment in the table below for 8 common or important microbiological organisms that 
affect patients with CF: Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Burkholderia cenocepacia, Haemophilus 
influenzae, P aeruginosa (small colony variant), P aeruginosa (mucoid), P aeruginosa (non-mucoid), 
Staphylococcus aureus, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. 
In general, shifts to higher or lower amounts of each microbe were sporadic and did not show any 
patterns across the treatment groups; however, this analysis is limited by the small number of 
subjects and a high incidence of unknown results for sputum samples.  
Additional efficacy variables 
Relative change from baseline in PPFEV1 
The mean relative change from baseline in PPFEV1 through Week 8 was greater during ivacaftor 
treatment (10.7549%) than during placebo treatment (-3.4147%); the treatment difference (95% CI) 
of 14.1696% (9.8953, 18.4439) was statistically significant (P <0.0001). 
Statistically significant treatment differences in relative change from baseline in PPFEV1 were detected 
by Week 2 (first post-baseline time point assessed; 11.2346% [95% CI: 6.3175, 16.1517]; P 
<0.0001) and increased through Week 8, with the largest treatment difference observed at Week 8 
(17.7334% [95% CI: 12.8020, 22.6649]; P <0.0001).

Change from baseline in additional spirometry endpoints (FEV1 (L), FVC, FEF25%-75%, 
FEV1/FVC, Percent Predicted FVC, Percent Predicted FEF25%-75%, and PPFEV1/FVC) 
The mean changes from baseline through Week 8 was greater in the ivacaftor group than in the 
placebo group for all parameters analysed; these differences were statistically significant (P <0.01).  
Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analyses were performed for primary and secondary endpoints. Comparisons were made 
between treatment groups within subgroup categories as follows for both the primary and secondary 
endpoints: 
•  Age Group at Baseline (6 to 11 years [inclusive], 12 to 17 years [inclusive], and ≥18 years) 
• 
PPFEV1 Severity at Baseline (<70%, 70% to 90% [inclusive], and >90% predicted) 
•  Geographic Region (North America and Europe) 
•  Sex (Female and Male) 
• 
P aeruginosa Infection Status at Baseline (Yes and No) 
The following subgroup comparison was made between treatment groups only for the secondary 
endpoints: 
•  Change From Baseline in PPFEV1 at Week 8 During Ivacaftor Treatment (≥5% and <5%)

Predictability of the effect of ivacaftor 
To give further support to the results obtained in study 111 after 8 weeks of treatment with ivacaftor, 
predictability of efficacy results through week 24 based on results through week 8 has been assessed 
by the MAH in two ways. First by providing a correlation between the Week 8 and Week 24 value for 
absolute change in PPFEV1 for the ivacaftor group that was 0.67884 (P <0.0001) in study 102 and 
0.86614 (P <0.0001) in study 103, supporting in the MAH’s opinion the utility of the Week 8 values in 
predicting the Week 24 treatment effect. And second, by performing a post-hoc analysis on the 
persistence of FEV1 response for subjects in the ivacaftor treatment group based on the value 
observed at Week 8. This analysis found that 60 (72%) of 83 subjects in study 102 maintained the 
same status of improvement at Week 24: 52 who had a ≥5 percentage-point improvement at both 
time points and 8 who had a ≥0 to <5 percentage-point improvement at both time points. In Study 
103, 19 (73%) of 26 subjects maintained the same Week 8 status of improvement at Week 24: 16 
who had a ≥5 percentage-point improvement at both time points and 3 who had ≤0 percentage-point 
improvement at both time points. Secondary efficacy variables in study 102 and 103 have also been 
analysed in this regard.  
Predictive potential of the sweat chloride test 
The MAH was requested to discuss the predictive potential of the sweat chloride test in identifying 
which patients would benefit from continuation of the therapy. This has been accomplished by the MAH 
as follows. First, an analysis of data from ivacaftor treated patients in study 111 has been performed 
aimed at determining the correlation of (change in) sweat chloride values with changes in FEV1, BMI 
and the respiratory domain of CFQ-R at week 8. No correlation was found as shown by Pearson’s 
correlations of -.0931, -.0473 and -.0877 respectively indicating that there is no linear relationship 
between the variables studied. Other analyses using changes in PPFEV1 did not show any correlation 
Kalydeco II-09

either. The MAH also discussed 3 papers where this concept has been investigated. Two of them11 12 
conclude that there is no correlation between the reduction in sweat chloride seen with ivacaftor in 
phase 3 studies in patients with a G551D-CFTR mutation and improvement in lung function (measured 
as FEV1). Third paper13 reached the same conclusion using a different patient population. The paper by 
Seliger et al (2013) investigated additionally the use of sweat chloride changes at day 15 as a 
predictive marker of response (i.e. an increase in FEV1 ≥ 5%) to ivacaftor at week 16 using data from 
phase 3 studies in patients with a G551D-CFTR mutation. Two thresholds (sweat chloride concentration 
≤ 80 mmol/L, and a raw change in sweat chloride ≥ 20 mmol/L) were used to calculate Positive 
Predictive Value (86.3%), sensitivity (73.9%), Negative Predictive Value (65.5%), and specificity 
(80.9%) for an improvement in FEV1 of ≥5% from baseline at week 16. The Negative Predictive Value 
of both thresholds combined is 65.5%, i.e. if the combined threshold is not reached the probability that 
the improvement in lung function can be achieved is still high, discouraging (in the opinion of the 
authors) the use of sweat chloride as a tool to identify ivacaftor non-responsive patients. Of note is 
that the improvement in FEV1 of equal or above 5% is based on FEV (L) rather than on PPFEV1.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study VX12-770-111 (study 111) was a phase 3, two-part, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, crossover study with an open-label period to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ivacaftor in 
subjects with cystic fibrosis who have a non-G551D-CFTR gating mutation. The crossover period (Part 
1) was immediately followed by a (currently) finished 16-week open-label period (Part 2) to provide 
efficacy and safety results for a total of 24 weeks of treatment with ivacaftor. This submission is based 
on the double-blind crossover period data (Part 1). 
In Part 1 of the study patients were randomized 1:1 to receive 1 of 2 Treatment Sequences during 8-
week Treatment Periods. The washout period lasted for 4 to 8 weeks. Based on the time frame of 
response in studies 102 and 103, the 8-week duration of the Treatment Periods was expected to be 
sufficient to demonstrate a treatment effect and pattern of response in CF patients with a CFTR gating 
mutation other than G551D. This study was the subject of a CHMP Follow-Up Protocol Assistance 
where the short term duration was endorsed provided that results were consistent with those of prior 
studies in patients with a G551D-CFTR mutation.  
Part 2 of study 111 has finished and the final CSR is expected to be available by June 2014. It should 
be provided as soon as it is available. Submission of results of this study is foreseen in the RMP. 
Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of CF (defined as chronic sinopulmonary disease AND a sweat 
chloride value ≥60 mmol/L or 2 CF-causing mutations), aged 6 years and older, with at least 1 allele of 
the following CFTR gating mutations G178R, S549N, S549R, G551S, G970R, G1244E, S1251N, 
S1255P, and G1349D were enrolled. In addition, patients must have had ≥40% predicted FEV1 based 
on the Hankinson (male subjects 18 years and older and female subjects 16 years and older) or Wang 
(male subjects aged 6 to 17 years and for female subjects aged 6 to 15 years) equations. Patients 
having a G551D mutant CFTR allele were excluded as its presence was expected to hamper the 
interpretation of the study results.  
A minimum of 20 subjects and a maximum of approximately 40 subjects were planned to be enrolled 
but no criterion was given upfront to determine the final sample size. Therefore, the MAH was 
requested to provide justification for the Standard Deviation (SD) used to estimate the study sample 
size. The MAH have clarified that the standard deviation of 8% corresponds to the mean of the SD of 
the ivacaftor and placebo groups at week 8 in studies 102 and 103. This is acceptable.  
Forty-two patients were screened and 39 randomised in a 1:1 ratio to Treatment Sequence 1 (ivacaftor 
150 mg every 12 hours → washout period → placebo) or Treatment Sequence 2 (placebo → washout 
Kalydeco II-09

period → ivacaftor 150 mg every 12 hours). In addition, patients were stratified for age (6 to 11 years, 
12 to 17 years, and ≥18 years) and FEV1 severity (<70%, ≥70% to ≤90%, and >90%). 
Three screened patients were not randomised and three randomised patients discontinued Part 1 of 
study 111. As not all of the patients enrolled received study drug treatment in Treatment Period 2, the 
numbers per treatment were lower than the total number of subjects enrolled in the study. Thirty-eight 
(38) patients who received ivacaftor and 37 patients who received placebo were evaluable for efficacy 
analysis.  
The majority of patients in both Treatment Sequences were White (75.0% in Treatment Sequence 1 
and 73.7% in Treatment Sequence 2) and of non-Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean age was 23.8 
years (range: 6 to 57) in Treatment Sequence 1 and 21.7 years (range: 6 to 47) in Treatment 
Sequence 2; there were 19 patients overall in the <18 years subgroup and 20 patients overall in the 
18 years subgroup. Patients were enrolled in North America (22 [56.4%] subjects) and the EU (17 
[43.6%] subjects). 
Mean baseline sweat chloride value (overall 97.54 mmol/L) and mean PPFEV1 at baseline (overall 
78.39%) were similar between the two Treatment Sequences. However, in Treatment Sequence 1 the 
minimum sweat chloride value was 12 mmol/l, i.e. completely within the normal range. This patient 
was a 57-year-old White female with CFTR genotype S1251N/F508del. At Day 1 (start of study drug 
dosing), she had a PPFEV1 value of 43.27% and a sweat chloride value of 12 mmol/L. After 8 weeks of 
ivacaftor treatment her PPFEV1 was 53.91% and her sweat chloride 5 mmol/L. The low baseline sweat 
chloride value and the presence of a hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome that courses (among others) 
with sinus and lung (staphylococcal) infections of repetition that lead to chronic cystic lung disease as 
one of the later features of the disease question whether the lung phenotype of this patient indicates 
cystic fibrosis. However, the subgroup analysis by non-G551D gating mutation supports the efficacy of 
ivacaftor in patients with the S1251N-CFTR mutation and an exploratory analysis excluding this patient 
showed consistency with those of the analysis including this patient.  
Maximum PPFEV1 was 118.7%. Distribution per PPFEV1 category was as follows: 7 patients (35%) in 
Treatment Sequence 1 and 6 (31.6%) in Treatment Sequence 2 had a baseline PPFEV1 of less than 
70%. In the category from ≥70% to ≤90% these figures were 6 (30%) and 6 (31.6) respectively. 
Last, the number and percentage of patients with a PPFEV1 higher than 90% was 7 (35%) and 7 
(36.8%) in Treatment Sequences 1 and 2, respectively.  
The study intended to enrol a minimum of 2 patients per non-G551D mutation. The most frequent 
CFTR genotype was S1251N/F508del with 4 patients per Treatment Sequence, i.e. a total of 8 patients. 
Most subjects had the class II F508del mutation on the second CFTR allele (24 out of the 39 subjects).  
Although the MAH concluded that the demography of subjects was generally balanced between the two 
treatment sequences there seems to be an uneven distribution of some factors between treatment 
sequences. 
Mean body weight (Kg) was 59.8 Kg in Treatment Sequence 1 as compared to 55.1 in Treatment 
Sequence 2. However, the maximum body weight quoted in Treatment Sequence 2 is 126 kg. This 
body weight corresponds to a 39-year-old White male patient whose CFTR genotype was 
F508del/G1349D. At Day 1 (start of placebo dosing), he had a PPFEV1 value of 84.5%, a sweat 
chloride value of 104.5 mmol/L, and a BMI of 38.5 kg/m2. After 8 weeks of ivacaftor treatment his BMI 
was 40.0 kg/m2, his PPFEV1 was 85.0% and his sweat chloride value was 15 mmol/L. Concomitant 
medications as well as his medical history support the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis with pancreatic 
insufficiency. The MAH states that obesity is increasingly seen among patients with cystic fibrosis and

refer to literature14 where the prevalence of overweight/obesity in a cross-sectional study of 68 
patients with cystic fibrosis at a single centre in Greece was  reported as 13.2% (9/68) using the 2005 
Cystic Fibrosis Foundation criteria. The authors conclude that certain degree of obesity (i.e. below 23 
kg/m2) in CF appears to exert a rather positive effect on lung function contrary to what is known about 
its role in non-CF populations. Overweight/obese patients in this study had pancreatic sufficiency 
(89.9%), mutations other than F508del (66.7%) and no traits of the metabolic syndrome. This does 
not seem to be the case of the obese patient enrolled in study 111 as he had pancreatic insufficiency 
and carried an F508del-CFTR mutation. There seems to be two additional patients with a BMI above 30 
kg/m2 with a genotype that involves the CFTR mutations G1244E and S549N. There are also a number 
of patients in study 111 with a BMI above 25 kg/m2.  
Genotype by gating mutation was evenly distributed except for G1244E-CFTR mutation (one patient in 
Treatment Sequence 1 and 4 patients in Treatment Sequence 2).  
CFTR mutations may cause CF or be associated with CFTR-related disorders but they also may have no 
clinical consequences or have unknown or uncertain clinical relevance15. All of the non-G551D gating 
mutations discussed are missense mutations for which the clinical role is difficult to assess. Therefore, 
it seems important to ensure that patients enrolled in study 111 had a clinical phenotype that is 
consistent with the clinical picture of CF as requested per inclusion criteria. The diagnostic criteria used 
in study 111 are in line with consensus recommendations. However, of the three main pillars on which 
the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis is based the great are of uncertainty is related to the decision on 
whether the mutations present are disease-causing. This is particularly the case of missense mutations 
such as the non-G551D gating mutations considered in this procedure. Therefore, it would appear that 
requiring two disease-causing mutations and a compatible clinical (lung disease) and biochemical (i.e. 
sweat chloride values well in the range of the disease) phenotype (rather than two disease-causing 
mutations or a sweat chloride ≥60 mmol/L) could have overcome issues related to patients/mutations 
having a normal sweat chloride or borderline values.  
The data provided show that 14 (70%) patients in Treatment Sequence 1 and 17 (89.5%) in 
Treatment Sequence 2 were pancreatic insufficient while 19 (95%) and 19 (100%) had CF lung 
disease.  
The number of patients receiving pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy was 26, below the number 
of 31 who had pancreatic insufficiency. Overall, 65% (13) of patients and 36.8% (7) of patients in 
Treatment Sequences 1 and 2 respectively received or were receiving inhaled antibiotics. The number 
of bacterial carriers per Treatment Sequence was 4 (20.0%) and 2 (10.5%) respectively. On the other 
hand, the subgroup analysis by P aeruginosa infection status at baseline shows that the percentage of 
patients on placebo and ivacaftor who were positive for this variable was 54.1% (20 patients) and 
47.4% (19), respectively. Nine patients on placebo (24.3%) and 8 on ivacaftor (21.1%) were receiving 
tobramycin while these figures for colistimethate sodium were 24.3% (9 patients) and 18.4% (7 
patients), respectively.  
Overall, there seems to be some mismatch between the number of patients with the above conditions 
and the numbers receiving medications intended for these conditions, e.g. there seems to be 
discrepancies between the numbers of patients who were positive at baseline for P aeruginosa infection 
and the number of patients who received inhaled antibiotics. It would have been desirable that the

patient population had been better characterised in terms of P aeruginosa lung infection/colonisation 
and in terms of patients receiving inhaled antibiotics for this reason.  
The primary efficacy variable of study 111 was the absolute change from baseline in PPFEV1 through 8 
weeks of treatment which is the recommended primary clinical endpoint in efficacy studies for CF given 
that lung function in CF declines with age and is a significant predictor of mortality. The primary 
efficacy analysis was based on a Mixed Effects Model for Repeated Measures (MMRM) in the Full 
Analysis Set. Sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the primary analysis were also 
performed.  
Overall, the methods of the study 111 are considered acceptable and this study is deemed suitable to 
investigate efficacy in the particular CF genotypes. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The mean absolute change from baseline in PPFEV1 through Week 8 by MMRM was greater during 
ivacaftor treatment (7.4868%) than during placebo treatment (-3.1912%). The estimated treatment 
difference (95%CI) for ivacaftor versus placebo was 10.6780% (7.2559, 14.1000). Statistically 
significant treatment differences were observed by Week 2 (first post-baseline time point assessed; 
8.3142% [95% CI: 4.5109, 12.1175]) and were sustained through Week 8 (13.7554% [95% CI: 
9.9414, 17.5694]. Sensitivity analyses supported the results of the main analysis.  
The responder analysis of changes in PPFEV1 as well as the waterfall plot provided showed, however, 
that there were a number of patients whose FEV1 deteriorated while on ivacaftor. As a consequence, 
the MAH was asked to provide the individual narratives of these patients. The narratives of seven 
patients were discussed. Two of these patients with genotypes S1251N/F508del and S549N/G542X had 
the maximum decreases during ivacaftor treatment, i.e. -19.57 at week 8 and -6.97 at week 4, 
respectively. While it was stated that patient S1251N/F508del experienced a pulmonary exacerbation 
during ivacaftor treatment, the narrative of the patient with the genotype S549N/G542X did not offer 
any reasonable explanation for the observed decrease in FEV1 at week 4, nevertheless, the patient 
experienced a much more pronounced decline in FEV1 during placebo-treatment (-21.55).The 
remaining patients with genotypes S549R/F508del, G178R/L1077P, G1244E/F508del, S1255P/Q1313X 
and G970R/F508del had more limited decreases in lung function that ranged from -3.53 to -0.78. 
Patients in the placebo group showed a decline in PPFEV1 that seems relatively rapid and consistent, 
but that has not been observed in the placebo arm of studies 102 and 103. In case this trend had 
continued during the 4-8 weeks washout period, the baseline PPFEV1 values of these patients in 
Sequence 2 would have been significantly lower than those of patients who were treated with ivacaftor 
in Sequence 1. As a consequence, the MAH was requested to address a possible inconsistency across 
studies in this regard and to provide the baseline characteristics and efficacy data separately for 
Sequence 1 and Sequence 2 (for both groups of patients, i.e. placebo-treated and ivacaftor-treated). It 
has been shown that outcomes at week 8 in studies 102 and 103 are similar to those observed in 
study 111. This is the case not only for the point estimates of the difference between treatments but 
also for the 95% confidence intervals that show a high degree of overlap. However, the absolute 
change from baseline trough week 8 in the placebo group differs between study 111 and studies 102 
and 103 as shown by a mean change of -0.2 and -1.7 in studies 102 and 103 respectively and -5.85 in 
study 111. This relatively rapid and consistent decrease in FEV1 in study 111 could not be fully 
explained by the MAH. It is argued that likely the small numbers and the inherent variability in the 
disease may partially explain this issue. The response also shows that variability (assessed based on 
standard deviations) was systematically lower in the placebo group of the three studies than in the 
ivacaftor group.

Regarding the placebo group, the statistical MMRM model included sequence, treatment, period, and 
visit within period as fixed effects, study baseline value and age as covariates, and subject nested 
within sequence as the random effect. Therefore and taking into account the effects included in that 
model, it would be the sequence effect, confounded with a carry-over effect in a 2x2 design, which 
might be considered as a potential source of concern in the analysis but not the period effect. In 
principle, despite the lack of statistical significance of the sequence effect, that term might be still 
considered as a source of concern in case of relevant clinical magnitude. However, given the relatively 
small sample size and the observed magnitudes this is not the case. In summary, with the current data 
there is no evidence of a statistically or clinically relevant carry-over effects which could impair the 
interpretation of the study results.  
Subgroup analyses of the main efficacy variable should be viewed with caution due to the small 
numbers but it is noticed that patients enrolled in the USA showed a lower mean absolute change from 
baseline in PPFEV1 of 6.1% as compared to that of patients enrolled in Europe (11.8%). No full 
explanation for the observed numerical difference in response seen between the two regions was 
provided, but this difference, in the opinion of the MAH, lacks clinical relevance given the overlap in the 
95%CI intervals of the difference between treatments in the two regions. This can be accepted but it 
cannot be excluded that the patient population enrolled in these two regions could differ in some 
characteristics (e.g. the 4 patients with the G970R-CFTR mutation have been all enrolled in Europe) or 
that there could be differences in the standard of care that may help to explain this observation. As the 
overall results of the trial should be considered, no additional issues are raised in this regard. 
Children aged 6 to less than 12 years showed a smaller change in PPFEV1 (5.2%) as compared to 
adolescents (9.2%) and adults (8.7%). The small number of children (overall n=8) and often the poor 
reproducibility of pulmonary function in them likely influenced the change in PPFEV1 seen in this 
population.  
The presence of P aeruginosa infection at baseline (20 patients on placebo and 19 patients on 
ivacaftor) had little impact on the change in PPFEV1 (7.5% vs. 8.1% for those not having P aeruginosa 
infection at baseline). 
Subgroup analysis by the non-G551D gating mutation was not initially performed. The MAH rationale 
that “… a reliable analysis of efficacy and safety results by genotype was not feasible because each 
mutation was only represented by a small number of patients” is acknowledged. However, given the 
potential heterogeneity of the patient population it was considered that an analysis by non-G551D 
gating mutation considering also the mutation in the second allele should have been provided and 
discussed as this could facilitate a more detailed evaluation on the consistency of efficacy across 
genotypes. As a consequence, these subgroup analyses were performed and discussed by the MAH. 
Efficacy results were presented and summarised at different points in time for the endpoints studied 
and for every non-G551D mutation. Results (confined to the changes in sweat chloride and PPFEV1) 
are shown for patients treated with ivacaftor in Table 29 of this report. 
As stated in the section on clinical pharmacology the analysis of the relationship between in vitro 
(either as fold change over baseline in chloride transport or as percent of normal with ivacaftor) and in 
vivo data (absolute change from baseline at week 8 of ivacaftor treatment in any of the primary or 
secondary variables assessed in study 111) did not show a correlation or trend.  
Summary statistics for absolute change in BMI by treatment arms and type of non-G551D mutation 
showed that the smallest increase in BMI was observed in patients with the G551S- and G970R-CFTR 
mutations. The smallest decrease in sweat chloride values during ivacaftor treatment was also seen in 
patients with the G970R-CFTR mutation compared to subjects with other CFTR mutations. This was 
Kalydeco II-09

also the case of the respiratory domain of the CFQ-R, i.e. the smallest change in this parameter was 
observed in patients with the G970R mutation. The results by non-G551D gating mutation are included 
in Section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
The overall conclusion is that patients carrying non-G551D gating mutations constitute a 
heterogeneous population. As part of the response to the CHMP Major Objection the MAH proposed to 
detail the individual CFTR gating mutations in section 4.1 of the SmPC (instead of the initial 
unrestricted indication proposed for all non-G551D gating mutations). However, for listing all 
mutations studied in trial 111 there are some signals which cannot be ignored, such as the consistent 
lower efficacy of ivacaftor in patients carrying a G970R-CFTR mutation. 
Given this heterogeneity and as far as the rationale behind the lack of response to ivacaftor for specific 
mutations is unclear changes in sweat chloride and PPFEV1 by non-G551D gating mutation (including 
G970R) are being included in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Analysis by the mutation affecting the second allele of the CFTR gene has been performed but not 
discussed by the MAH on grounds that about 75% of the study 111 patients had a second allele 
genotype that could be considered unresponsive to ivacaftor (i.e. F508del-CFTR and stop codon 
mutations) and, consequently, it is unlikely that the second allele had any substantial effect on the 
overall efficacy outcomes in this study. The results provided indicate that patients with a stop codon 
mutation are the ones who have the greatest reduction in sweat chloride with ivacaftor (-74.75 
mmol/L) while at the same time experienced the smallest change in PPFEV1 (1.73). The stop codon 
mutations concerned are Y913X, G542X, or Q1313X. An additional stop codon mutation (R1158X) was 
mistakenly included in a different category for the analysis. The MAH stated that this does not impact 
the interpretation of the data for either grouping category. 
Secondary endpoints were change from baseline in BMI at 8 weeks of treatment, change from baseline 
in sweat chloride through 8 weeks of treatment, change from baseline in the respiratory domain of the 
CFQ-R through 8 weeks of treatment and safety. As it can be seen for most efficacy variables the 
change from baseline is calculated through 8 weeks of treatment while for BMI it is estimated at week 
8 suggesting that the expected change in BMI may be achieved later. 
The mean absolute change from baseline in BMI at Week 8 (rate of change difference) by LMM was 
greater during ivacaftor treatment (0.6787 kg/m2) than during placebo treatment (0.0163 kg/m2). The 
treatment difference (95%CI) was 0.6624 kg/m2 (0.3366, 0.9881). The mean absolute change from 
baseline in BMI-for-age z-score (CDC growth chart for the 19 subjects who were 20 years of age or 
younger) at Week 8 by LMM was greater during treatment with ivacaftor (0.2437 points) than during 
placebo treatment (-0.0392 points). The treatment difference (95%CI) was 0.2830 points (0.1167, 
0.4492). Change from baseline in weight through Week 8 (tertiary endpoint) was greater during 
ivacaftor treatment (2.0099 kg) than during placebo treatment (0.3425 kg). The treatment difference 
(95% CI) was 1.6674 kg (0.7098, 2.6250).  
The change from baseline in BMI was relatively rapid and the highest (0.9) in patients of 6-11 years of 
age. The MAH was requested to comment the possible role of water retention. The MAH response 
focused on showing that there is no signal that suggests problematic fluid retention in ivacaftor-treated 
patients. However, assessment of the nutritional status requires (in addition to weight or BMI) 
measurements of body composition, anthropometric and other measurements that have not been 
collected in the ivacaftor trials so far. 
It can be suggested that the beneficial effect of ivacaftor on the nutritional status i.e. clinically 
meaningful increase in body weight is an indirect proof of the better absorption of lipids and proteins. 
In study 111, 63-65% of patients were treated with pancreatic enzymes for their insufficient enzyme

secretion. In order to refine evaluation of the effect of ivacaftor on the exocrine pancreatic function the 
MAH was requested to provide an analysis on BMI-z-scores by baseline use of pancreatic enzymes. The 
MAH’s data and analyses showed that ivacaftor therapy should be optimized with exogenous pancreatic 
enzyme therapy in the majority of CF patients. An indirect proof that ivacaftor may improve the 
impaired exocrine pancreatic function (pancreatic bicarbonate secretion) has been provided16. 
The mean absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride (mmol/L) through Week 8 was greater 
during ivacaftor treatment (-52.2801 mmol/L) than during placebo treatment (-3.1134 mmol/L). The 
estimated treatment difference (95%CI) for ivacaftor versus placebo was -49.1667 mmol/L (-56.9527, 
-41.3807). Statistically significant treatment differences were detected by Week 2 (first post-baseline 
time point assessed). 
The responder analysis of absolute change at Week 8 in sweat chloride shows that three subjects had a 
>20 mmol decrease in sweat chloride on placebo while similarly three subjects had <5 mmol decrease 
in sweat chloride while receiving ivacaftor. The waterfall plots provided of change in sweat chloride at 
weeks 2, 4, and 8 show that the majority of the patients had a clear reduction in sweat chloride during 
ivacaftor treatment, i.e. almost all mutations consistently displayed a decrease in sweat chloride well 
above 20 mmol/L with ivacaftor (see Figure 4). 
Patients who had the smallest decreases in sweat chloride values while on treatment with ivacaftor all 
carried the G970R-CFTR mutation. The analysis at week 8 of the mean absolute change in sweat 
chloride shows that in 3 out of the 4 patients enrolled in study 111 the reduction was below 5 mmol/L 
and between 5 and 20 mmol/L for the remaining patient. Similarly, the mean (SD) absolute change in 
PPFEV1 at week 8 was 0.4 (3.7) and 2.6 (2.7) for placebo- and ivacaftor-treated patients. These 
results are comparatively inferior to those achieved by patients with other non-G551D gating 
mutations and, therefore, patients with a G970R-CFTR gating mutation should be excluded from the 
proposed indication given these consistent findings.  
There were three patients with a decrease in sweat chloride above 20 mmol/L while on placebo. All of 
them had pancreatic insufficiency and their genotype (G1349D/2183AA>G, S549R/F508del and 
S549N/N1303K) did not suggested a specific pattern. The MAH has not provided any suitable 
explanation for this finding (methodological or otherwise). In spite of that, for all the mutations to be 
included in the indication there are patients substantially reducing their sweat chloride with ivacaftor 
even in relation to the placebo patients above mentioned. Given the small numbers it is considered 
that this evidence is sufficient.  
The mean absolute change from baseline in the pooled (excluding the Parents and Caregivers version) 
CFQ-R respiratory domain score through Week 8 by MMRM was greater during ivacaftor treatment 
(8.9385 points) than during placebo treatment (-0.6720 points). The estimated treatment difference 
(95%CI) for ivacaftor versus placebo was 9.6105 points (4.4874, 14.7336) and exceeds the defined 
minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 4 points. Subgroup analysis by age show that the 
change in CFQ-R respiratory domain score was not statistically significant in subjects aged 6-11 years 
and also in subjects who had ≥70% of PPFEV1 baseline values. CFQ-R is a relatively insensitive 
instrument, particularly in children and adolescents and therefore the lack of significant effect in these 
populations is not surprising. 
A number of tertiary endpoints have been also assessed in study 111. Overall, their results are 
consistent with the analysis of the main and secondary endpoints although for some of them

statistically significant differences versus placebo were not shown (e.g. pulmonary exacerbations event 
rate) but trends are not unfavourable for ivacaftor.  
A tertiary endpoint assessed was change from baseline in qualitative microbiological cultures but the 
analysis was limited by the small number of subjects and a high incidence of unknown results for 
sputum samples. This is unfortunate as ivacaftor has a quionoline ring in its molecule and has been 
shown to have direct antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria17.  
In conclusion, statistically significant differences in favour of ivacaftor 150 g every 12 hours versus 
placebo were seen in the primary and secondary endpoints of study 111. Results of the primary 
endpoint are not only statistically significant but also clinically relevant. However, the narratives 
provided for patients with unexpected results in sweat chloride while on treatment with ivacaftor or 
placebo and the analysis by specific non-G551D gating mutation show that the patient population is 
likely very heterogeneous and consequently a broader indication for patients with any non G551D-
CFTR gating mutation cannot be accepted. The MAH’s latest proposed indication is limited to the 
specific mutations that have been studied in study 111 and excluding the G970R mutation in which 
efficacy could not be demonstrated. This is endorsed. 
Based on information provided on predictability of efficacy results in other studies through week 24 
based on results through week 8, there seems to be a good agreement between results at week 8 and 
week 24. However, this is based on post-hoc analyses and as such conclusions should be drawn with 
caution.  
The MAH stated that in their view the mutation-by-mutation approach to implementing personalized 
medicine for CF is not optimal as there will continue to be rare mutations discovered, including severe 
gating mutations, which can be functionally characterized but would have no practical pathway for 
being included in the label. This is acknowledged. However, as far as the rationale behind the lack of 
response to ivacaftor of specific mutations/patients is unclear it is not possible to ignore the consistent 
effect seen in patients with the G970R-CFTR mutation treated with ivacaftor. If a response-guided 
therapy were available (see below) this would be less of a concern as patients could be assessed 
individually. Overall, the MAH is encouraged to further pursue the characterisation of the mechanism of 
action of ivacaftor as well as the identification of individual factors that may be predictive of response 
to it. 
The MAH was asked to elaborate and discuss a rule of decision that may help physicians to decide 
whether to keep or to interrupt treatment with ivacaftor based on these results, e.g. similarly to what 
has been done by Van Goor et al18 for the predictive potential of the sweat chloride test in cystic 
fibrosis patients with the G551D mutation. However, as explained by the MAH a suitable response-
guided therapy cannot be identified. Therefore, the indication for ivacaftor in patients with cystic 
fibrosis carrying a non-G551D-CFTR mutation should be based on the identification of those individual 
mutations for which a benefit is seen in a clinical study. As a consequence, the individual mutations 
have been listed in section 4.1 of the SmPC excluding, as previously discussed, the G970R-CFTR 
mutation. Data for this mutation are still included in section 5.1 of the SmPC.

and a non-G551D gating mutation in an allele of the CFTR gene were enrolled. Overall, these patients 
seem to have a mild to moderate disease phenotype. Consistency has been observed between the 
primary and secondary endpoints in study 111. This seems also to be the case across studies, i.e. with 
studies 102 and 103 in patients with a G551D mutation. In spite of the above results concerns were 
raised regarding the potential heterogeneity of gating mutations and the patient population enrolled in 
study 111, as well as on whether all of the non-G551D gating mutations assessed in this study were 
disease-causing. The narratives provided for patients with unexpected results in changes in sweat 
chloride while on treatment with ivacaftor or placebo and the analysis by specific non-G551 gating 
mutation show that the patient population is indeed heterogeneous and consequently a broader 
indication for patients with any non G551D-CFTR gating mutation could not be accepted. As a 
consequence, the MAH proposed to limit the indication to the specific mutations that were assessed in 
study 111, excluding patients carrying the G970R gating mutation as for this mutation efficacy could 
not be demonstrated. 
The discussion of a possible response guided therapy (i.e. a rule to identify patients who benefit from 
treatment with ivacaftor) was requested, however, a suitable response-guided therapy could not be 
identified. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The MAH provided in the current submission short-term safety data from patients with CF aged 6 years 
and older and a non-G551D gating mutation in an allele of the CFTR gene exposed to ivacaftor and/or 
placebo in Part 1 (20 to 24 week crossover study) of study 111.  
Patient exposure 
A  total  of  38  subjects  who  received  ivacaftor  treatment  and  37  subjects  who  received  placebo  were 
evaluated  for  safety.  Table  below  provides  summary  statistics  for the  mean duration  of  ivacaftor  and 
placebo treatment. 
Table 31.  Study Drug Exposure, part 1, Safety Set 
The mean treatment duration (SD) was similar for both ivacaftor (54.7 [6.56] days) and placebo (56.4 
[2.14] days). The maximum study drug exposure was 60 days for ivacaftor and 62 days for placebo. 
Most  subjects  received  at  least  8  weeks  of  treatment;  all  but  1  subject  received  at  least  4  weeks  of 
treatment.

Subject disposition and the reasons provided by the investigator for the premature discontinuation of 
study drug in the non-pooled Phase 3 study (Study 111) are provided in the table below. In Part 1 of 
Study 111, 1 subject was lost to follow-up and 2 subjects discontinued for “other” reasons (“washout 
extended due to antibiotic usage” and “per sponsor, did not qualify to continue”).

Adverse events 
In this crossover study, adverse events were attributed to the study drug (ivacaftor or placebo) the 
subject received during the treatment period in which the event occurred. Adverse events that started 
(or increased in severity) during the Washout Period between Treatment Period 1 and Treatment 
Period 2 were attributed to the treatment received in Treatment Period 1. Adverse event summary 
tables include TEAEs only. The incidence of adverse events is provided for Study 111 in the table 
below.

Table 33.  Summary of Adverse Events Incidence: Phase 3 Crossover study 111 
The proportion of subjects with adverse events during ivacaftor treatment was 73.7% while the 
proportion of subjects with adverse events in the placebo group was 83.8%. The incidence of subjects 
with adverse events considered by the investigator to be related to the study drug was higher during 
ivacaftor (21.1%) than during placebo treatment (8.1%).  
The adverse events with an incidence of at least 3% of subjects during either treatment are presented 
by SOC and PT in table below.

The SOC with the highest incidence of adverse events during both treatments was infections and 
infestations (39.5% during ivacaftor and 45.9% during placebo treatment). Other classes with an 
incidence of at least 10% during ivacaftor treatment and a higher incidence than during placebo 
treatment were as follows: 
•  General disorders and administration site conditions (23.7% during ivacaftor treatment and 5.4% 
during placebo) 
• 
Investigations (10.5% during ivacaftor treatment and 5.4% during placebo) 
•  Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (10.5% during ivacaftor treatment and 2.7% 
during placebo) 
By PT, the adverse events with the highest incidence during both treatments were infective pulmonary 
exacerbation of CF and cough. The incidence of both events was lower during ivacaftor than placebo 
treatment:  
• 
Infective pulmonary exacerbation of CF (23.7% of subjects during ivacaftor treatment and 29.7% 
of subjects during placebo) 
•  Cough (13.2% of subjects during ivacaftor treatment and 18.9% of subjects during placebo) 
Adverse events for which the incidence was at least 5% higher with ivacaftor than placebo treatment 
were as follows: 
• 
Fatigue (5.3% [2 subjects] ivacaftor treatment and 0 subjects during placebo treatment) 
•  Constipation (5.3% [2 subjects] during ivacaftor treatment and 0 subjects during placebo 
treatment)

•  Arthralgia (5.3% [2 subjects] during ivacaftor treatment and 0 subjects during placebo treatment) 
• 
Pyrexia (7.9% [3 subjects] during ivacaftor treatment and 2.7% [1 subject] during placebo 
treatment) 
The majority of adverse events during both treatments were considered by the investigator to be not 
related or unlikely related to the study drug (not related: 28.9% during ivacaftor and 40.5% during 
placebo treatment; unlikely related: 23.7% during ivacaftor and 35.1% during placebo treatment). The 
proportion of subjects who had adverse events considered by the investigator to be possibly related to 
the study drug was higher during ivacaftor (21.1% [8 subjects]) than during placebo treatment (8.1% 
[3 subjects]). 
The incidence of all adverse events considered related or possibly related to the study drug by SOC 
and PT is presented in table below.  
Table 35.  Related or Possibly Related Adverse Events by System Organ Class and Preferred Term by 
Treatment, Part 1, Safety Set 
During both treatments, the majority of subjects had adverse events that were mild or moderate in 
severity. Compared with placebo, ivacaftor was associated with a lower incidence of moderate and 
severe events (moderate: 18.4% during ivacaftor treatment versus 35.1% during placebo treatment; 
severe: 10.5% during ivacaftor treatment versus 21.6% during placebo treatment). There were no 
life-threatening adverse events in this study.  
The severe adverse events that occurred during the study are presented by SOC and PT in table below.

Serious adverse events, deaths, other significant events 
There were no deaths in this study. 
The proportion of subjects with at least 1 serious adverse event (SAE) during ivacaftor treatment was 
10.5% as compared to 18.9% of patients in the placebo group. The incidence of SAEs considered by 
the investigator to be related to the study drug was similar during the 2 treatments: 2.6% during 
ivacaftor and 2.7% during placebo treatment. During each treatment, 1 subject had a SAE considered 
possibly related to study drug (paranasal cyst during placebo treatment and DIOS during ivacaftor 
treatment). Table below presents the incidence of SAEs by SOC and PT.

Laboratory findings 
Clinical laboratory evaluations were conducted at baseline and at 2, 4, and 8 weeks following the first 
dose of each treatment.  
Liver Function Tests 
Mean absolute changes from baseline for LFT parameters are presented in table below.  
Table 42.  Liver Function Test Parameter Absolute Changes From Baseline at Week 8, Part 1, Safety 
Set 
Most subjects had maximum on-treatment ALT, AST, and total bilirubin results ≤2 × ULN (94.7%, 
100.0%, and 100.0%, respectively, on ivacaftor treatment and 91.9%, 97.3%, and 100.0%, 
respectively, on placebo treatment). No differences >5% were noted between the placebo and 
ivacaftor treatments for any category (≤2 × ULN, >2 × to ≤3 × ULN, >3 × to ≤5 × ULN, >5 × to ≤8 
× ULN, and >8 × ULN).  
During ivacaftor treatment, no subjects had a maximum ALT or AST value that was >5 × ULN. Two 
(5.3%) subjects had at least 1 maximum ALT value >3 x ULN to ≤5 x ULN. During placebo treatment, 
1 subject (2.7%) had ALT >2 x ULN to ≤3 x ULN, 1 subject (2.7%) had ALT >3 x ULN to ≤5 x ULN, 
and 1 subject (2.7%) had a maximum on-treatment ALT and AST values >8 × ULN. No subjects had a 
maximum total bilirubin value >2 × ULN during either treatment. 
One subject had normal ALT (24 U/L) and AST (33 U/L) values at baseline and received placebo during 
Treatment Period 1. At Week 2 (Day 15 after the first dose of placebo), the subject’s ALT and AST 
values were found to be elevated: ALT of 558 U/L (>8 × ULN) and AST of 955 U/L (>8 × ULN). An 
adverse event of increased hepatic enzymes occurred, and study drug was interrupted. Results of 
laboratory assessments obtained at the local laboratory within 2 days (Study Day 17) of the initial 
elevation showed that ALT was 288 U/L (>3 x ULN to ≤5 x ULN) and AST was 63 U/L (≤2 x ULN). At 
the next assessment on Study Day 22, ALT had further declined to 114 U/L, and AST was 90 U/L. By 
Week 4, ALT was 69 U/L (>2 × ULN), and by Week 8, it had further decreased to 34 U/L (≤2 × ULN). 
AST values returned to ≤2 × ULN by Week 8 (48 U/L). Study drug was resumed on Day 28, and the 
subject continued in the study with no further LFT increases. Bilirubin values were not elevated at any 
time during this placebo treatment. 
None of the subjects had elevations of LFTs that met the criteria for Hy’s Law.

Other clinical chemistry parameters (creatinine, total protein, and albumin) 
The mean values for all parameters fluctuated during each treatment but remained within normal limits 
at all time points. The slight changes in each parameter were generally consistent for both treatments, 
and no notable trends were observed over time. Overall, shifts to low or high values were infrequent 
throughout the study, and the incidence of shifts was similar for both treatments. 
Adverse events associated with abnormal chemistry values occurred infrequently, and none resulted in 
the discontinuation of study drug. Adverse events of ALT increased, blood creatinine increased, CRP 
increased, and GGT increased were each reported by 1 subject (2.6%) during ivacaftor treatment; 
hypoglycaemia and hepatic enzyme increased were each reported by 1 subject (2.7%) during placebo 
treatment. 
Haematology 
Mean concentrations for all parameters remained relatively stable and within normal limits through 
Week 8. The slight changes from baseline in most parameters were similar for both treatments. During 
ivacaftor treatment, mean values for haemoglobin, neutrophils, platelets, and leukocytes demonstrated 
a trend toward decreases from baseline up to Week 4 and remained relatively stable thereafter. The 
magnitude of the mean change for these same parameters was smaller during placebo treatment. The 
incidence of shifts to low or high values was generally similar during both treatments. 
Adverse events associated with abnormal haematology values were infrequent, and none resulted in 
the discontinuation of study drug. Adverse events associated with abnormal haematology values 
included neutrophil count increased, WBC count increased, and anaemia, each reported by 1 subject 
(2.6%) during ivacaftor treatment.  
Coagulation 
Mean absolute changes from baseline in prothrombin time remained relatively stable throughout both 
treatments. Twenty subjects had at least 1 abnormal thromboplastin or prothrombin time value during 
the study; however, these abnormalities occurred with similar incidence during both treatments, and 
none of the subjects had adverse events related to abnormal coagulation parameters during either 
treatment. 
ECG 
There were no clinically important trends attributable to ivacaftor treatment identified in the standard 
digital ECGs. None of the patients had a QTc interval >450 msec during the ivacaftor or placebo 
treatment. Two patients (5.3%) had maximum increases of >30 to ≤60 msec in QTcF during the 
ivacaftor treatment. Increases in QTcB of >30 to ≤60 msec were observed in 3 patiens (8.1%) during 
the placebo treatment and 3 patients (7.9%) during the ivacaftor treatment. None of the patients had 
a QTcF or QTcB increase of >60 msec during either treatment. There were no adverse events 
associated with ECG abnormalities in study 111.

Adverse events of interest – increased airway secretions 
Due to a report in literature19 that “increased bronchial secretions may warrant increased 
physiotherapy and intravenous antibiotic treatment in these patients when ivacaftor is initiated” the 
MAH was asked to discuss increased airway secretions. 
According to the MAH, the review of the available clinical data did not suggest that the first 8 weeks of 
ivacaftor treatment was associated with increased airway secretions or increased secretions that would 
lead to the need for clinical intervention, including additional intravenous antibiotic therapy in subjects 
with severe CF (<40% predicted FEV1). In placebo-controlled, Phase 3 studies, no increase in the 
incidence of events associated with increased airway secretions in ivacaftor-treated subjects (10.0%) 
compared with placebo (11.5%) was observed. Several other literature reports describe the clinical 
experience of compassionate use ivacaftor in patients with an FEV1 <40%, and do not include mention 
an increase in airway secretions. In preliminary data from the US expanded access programme, 4 out 
of 44 (9.1%) patients had increased secretions (comprising preferred terms of respiratory tract 
congestion and sputum increased) comparable to the rate observed in the first 8 weeks of treatment in 
the Phase 3 studies. Additionally, events with onset within 8 weeks of the start of ivacaftor treatment 
were all non-serious, mild in severity, and most resolved without treatment. 
Safety in special populations 
In Study 111, the incidence of adverse events was summarized for subgroups based on age at baseline 
(6 to 11 years [inclusive], 12 to 17 years [inclusive], and ≥18 years at baseline), sex (female and 
male), PPFEV1 severity at baseline (<70%, ≥70% to ≤90%, and >90% predicted), and geographic 
region (North America and Europe). While small sample sizes in the subgroups preclude definitive 
conclusions, subgroup analyses did not suggest any notable differences in safety based on age, sex, 
baseline FEV1 severity, or geographic region. A meaningful analysis of safety by genotype was not 
feasible because each mutation was only represented by a small number of subjects. Safety results of 
the subgroup analyses based on age, sex, baseline PPFEV1, and geographic region have been 
presented previously.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
No subjects had adverse events that led to study drug interruption during ivacaftor treatment. During 
placebo treatment, 1 subject (2.7%) had an adverse event of increased hepatic enzymes that led to 
study drug interruption. The event resolved and the subject resumed dosing and continued in the 
study following the interruption. 
During placebo treatment, 3 other subjects had an interruption of study drug coincident with adverse 
events (Subject [missed 18 doses], Subject [missed 9 doses], and Subject [missed 1 dose]). However, 
the investigator reported the interruptions as “missing doses” and not as study drug interruptions for 
adverse events.  
Post marketing experience 
Ivacaftor is marketed in the US, European Union, Canada, and Australia. A cumulative and interval 
summary tabulation of serious and non-serious adverse reactions was provided in second Periodic 
Safety Update Report (24 January 2013 to 23 July 2013), which covered a total of 1789 patients and 
19 Hebestreit et al. Effects of ivacaftor on severely ill patients with cystic fibrosis carrying a G551D mutation. Journal of

489018 person-days (286 patients 6 to 11 years of age) who received at least 1 dose of ivacaftor 
during the time period from the International Birth Date of ivacaftor (31 January 2012) to 23 July 
2013. There has been no significant change in the potential or identified risks and no new potential or 
identified risks. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Short-term safety data from patients with CF aged 6 years and older and a non-G551D-CFTR gating 
mutation exposed to ivacaftor and/or placebo in Part 1 of study 111 were provided. 
The Safety Set includes 39 patients who were randomised to Treatment Sequence 1 (n=20) and 
Treatment Sequence 2 (n=19). Twenty-seven (73%) placebo-treated patients and 26 (68.4%) 
ivacaftor-treated patients received at least 8 weeks of treatment while the median length of therapy in 
10 (27.0%) and 11 (28.9) patients respectively was from 4 to less than 8 weeks. All patients but 1 
subject received at least 4 weeks of treatment. 
The proportion of patients with adverse events during ivacaftor treatment was 73.7% (28/38) while 
the proportion of patients with adverse events in the placebo group was 83.8% (31/37). Twenty-eight 
ivacaftor-treated patients reported a total of 91 adverse events while 31 placebo-treated patients 
reported 109 adverse events. 
The SOC with the highest incidence of adverse events during both treatments was Infections and 
Infestations (39.5% during ivacaftor and 45.9% during placebo treatment). Within this SOC infective 
pulmonary exacerbation of CF were reported by 9 (23.7%) patients during ivacaftor treatment and 11 
(29.7%) patients during placebo. Sputum increased was reported by 3 (7.9%) ivacaftor-treated 
patients and 3 (8.1%) placebo-treated patients.  
By Preferred Term the incidence of the following adverse events was higher in ivacaftor-treated 
patients than in placebo-treated patients: rhinitis was reported by 3 (7.9%) ivacaftor patients and 2 
(5.4%) placebo patients; pyrexia was reported by 3 (7.9%) ivacaftor patients and 1 (2.7%) placebo 
patient; fatigue and constipation were reported by 2 (5.3%) ivacaftor patients each; in the SOC 
Investigations 4 (10.5%) ivacaftor patients reported some adverse event versus 2 (5.4%) placebo 
patients. The adverse events that belong to the SOC Investigations will be addressed later (see Liver 
Function Tests). Arthralgia was reported by 2 (5.3%) ivacaftor patients. However, the number of 
adverse events reported in the SOC Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders is 4 in the 
ivacaftor group. The remaining adverse events reported were intervertebral disk protrusion (1 event), 
back pain (1 event) and torticollis (1 event). Pyrexia is described within the SOC General Disorders and 
Administration Site Conditions. The number of patients reporting adverse events in this SOC is 9 
(23.7%) for ivacaftor and 2 (5.4%) for placebo. Other Preferred Terms used within this SOC are 
malaise and fatigue that have been reported only by ivacaftor-treated patients.  
The incidence of patients with adverse events considered by the investigator to be related to the study 
drug (i.e. adverse reactions) was higher during ivacaftor (21.1% [8 patients]) than during placebo 
treatment (8.1%, [3 patients]). By Preferred Term sputum increased was reported by 2 (5.3%) 
ivacaftor-treated patients while none of the placebo patients reported this adverse reaction. 
Treatment-related investigations (increased ALT, increased blood creatinine, increased GGT) only 
occurred during ivacaftor treatment (5.3% [2 patients]) while treatment-related skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders only occurred during placebo treatment (5.4% [2 patients]). The 
incidence of adverse reactions in all other SOCs was 1 patient during ivacaftor treatment and the 
Preferred Terms include anaemia, dysgeusia, distal ileal obstructive syndrome and metrorrhagia. The 
Kalydeco II-09  
EMA/CHMP/360053/2014 
Page 80/90 
 
 
 
 
 
incidence of adverse events considered related or possibly related to study drug during placebo 
treatment was 1 patient (2.7%) each for paranasal cyst, rash, and urticaria. 
Regarding the severity of the adverse events reported, compared with placebo, ivacaftor was 
associated with a lower incidence of moderate and severe events (moderate: 18.4% during ivacaftor 
treatment versus 35.1% during placebo treatment; severe: 10.5% during ivacaftor treatment versus 
21.6% during placebo treatment). There were no life-threatening adverse events in study 111. There 
was a severe adverse event of headache in an ivacaftor-treated patient that apparently was not 
considered treatment related although headache is listed in section 4.8 of the Kalydeco SmPC as a 
very common adverse reaction.  
There were no deaths in study 111. The number of patients with at least 1 serious adverse event (SAE) 
during ivacaftor treatment was 4 (10.5%) as compared to 7 (18.9%) patients in the placebo group. 
The most common SAE during both treatments was infective pulmonary exacerbation of CF (5.3% [2 
patients] during ivacaftor treatment and 16.2% [6 patients] during placebo treatment). SAEs of DIOS 
and intervertebral disc protrusion were each reported for 1 patient during ivacaftor treatment; 
appendiceal mucocele, intussusception, paranasal cyst, and pneumothorax were each reported for 1 
patient during placebo treatment. During each treatment, 1 patient had a SAE considered possibly 
related to study drug (paranasal cyst during placebo treatment and DIOS during ivacaftor treatment). 
Interpretation of safety analysis by subgroups is hampered by the small number of patients and 
therefore it should be considered exploratory only.  
A total of 8 patients aged 6 to 11 years (inclusive) received ivacaftor and placebo; among patients 
aged 12 to 17 years (inclusive), 9 patients received placebo and 11 patients received ivacaftor 
treatment. In the subgroup ≥18 years, 20 patients received placebo and 19 patients received ivacaftor 
treatment. The overall incidence of patients with adverse events was lower in the ≥18 years subgroup 
than in the other two age subgroups during both ivacaftor and placebo treatment.  
During ivacaftor treatment, the incidence of infective pulmonary exacerbation of CF in the ≥18 years 
subgroup was 15.8% (3 patient, 4 events) compared to 25.0% (2 patients, 2 events) in the 6 to 11 
years (inclusive) subgroup and 36.4% (4 patients, 4 events) in the 12 to 17 years (inclusive) 
subgroup. During placebo treatment, the incidence of infective pulmonary exacerbation of CF in the 
≥18 years subgroup was 25.0% (5 patients, 7 events) compared to 37.5% (3 patients, 4 events) in 
the 6 to 11 years (inclusive) subgroup and 33.3% (3 patients, 3 events) in the 12 to 17 years 
(inclusive) subgroup. Adverse events more commonly reported by ivacaftor-treated patients (as 
compared to placebo) were as follows: Upper respiratory tract infection (2 events), pruritus (2 events), 
investigations (2 events), pyrexia (1 event) and arthralgia (1 event) in the 6 to 11 years (inclusive) 
age subset. For adolescents these adverse events were sputum increased (2 events), pyrexia (2 
events), fatigue (1 event), malaise (1 event), arthralgia (1 event), back pain (1 event), torticollis (1 
event) and headache (3 events). As previously stated headache is listed in section 4.8 of the Kalydeco 
SmPC as a very common adverse reaction. A serious adverse event occurred in one ivacaftor-treated 
child as compared to 3 placebo-patients.  
A total of 16 female patients received ivacaftor while 15 received placebo. The overall incidence of 
adverse events was slightly lower for male patients than for female patients during both treatments 
(male: 72.7% [16 patients, 45 events] during ivacaftor treatment and 81.8% [18 patients, 64 events] 
during placebo; female: 75.0% [12 patients, 46 events] during ivacaftor treatment and 86.7% [13 
patients, 45 events] during placebo). The incidence of serious adverse events was higher in the 
placebo group than in the ivacaftor group and higher in females than in males, i.e. placebo group: 
26.7% (4/15) of females versus 13.6% (3/12) of males; ivacaftor group: 12.5% (2/16) versus 9.1%

(2/22), respectively. The absolute numbers are, however, too small. In both males and females 
pulmonary exacerbations were the most frequent serious adverse events. 
A total of 13 patients with a baseline FEV1% predicted <70% received ivacaftor; in the categories of 
≥70% to ≤90% and >90% this number was 11 and 14, respectively. These figures for patients 
receiving placebo were 13, 11 and 13, respectively. The overall incidence of patients with any adverse 
events was lower during ivacaftor than during placebo treatment in the FEV1 <70% and in the FEV1 
≥70% to ≤90% predicted subgroups: 53.8% (7 patients, 27 events) during ivacaftor treatment and 
84.6% (11 patients, 43 events) during placebo treatment in the FEV1 <70% subgroup and 72.7% (8 
patients, 24 events) during ivacaftor treatment and 81.8% (9 patients, 33 events) during placebo 
treatment in the FEV1 ≥70% to ≤90% predicted subgroup. In the FEV1 >90% predicted subgroup, the 
incidence of patients with adverse events was higher during ivacaftor treatment (92.9% [13 patients, 
40 events]) than during placebo treatment (84.6% [11 patients, 33 events]). The incidence of infective 
pulmonary exacerbation of CF was lower during ivacaftor treatment (4 patients) than during placebo 
treatment (6 patients) in the <70% subgroup. The incidence was the same during both treatments in 
the ≥70% to ≤90% subgroup and similar during both treatments in the >90% subgroup. 
Twenty-one patients from North America and 16 from Europe received placebo and 21 and 17 received 
ivacaftor, respectively. The overall incidence of subjects with adverse events during ivacaftor 
treatment was 71.4%, (15 patients, 46 events) in North America and 76.5% (13 patients, 45 events) 
in Europe. The overall incidence of infective pulmonary exacerbations of CF during ivacaftor treatment 
was 19.0% (4 patients, 5 events) in North America and 29.4% (5 patients, 5 events) in Europe. During 
placebo treatment, the overall incidence of patients with adverse events was 76.2% (16 patients, 68 
events) in North America and 93.8% (15 patients, 41 events) in Europe; the incidence of infective 
pulmonary exacerbation of CF was 42.9% (9 patients, 11 events) in North America and 12.5% (2 
patients, 3 events) in Europe. 
The subgroup analysis by region suggests a different behaviour in the reporting system between the 
two regions. It is somehow difficult to understand the high number of adverse events reported in 
Europe by placebo patients as compared to North America (almost a 20% difference between the two 
regions). Similarly, the difference between the two regions regarding the percentage of infective 
pulmonary exacerbation of CF reported is surprising. The MAH was requested to discuss the 
differences. The MAH acknowledged that there is a numerical difference in reporting rates for the AE of 
infective pulmonary exacerbation of CF reported in EU by placebo patients as compared to North 
America. No consistent pattern could be found between regions when compared the ivacaftor and 
placebo treatment periods. The MAH stated that this may be a chance finding due to multiple 
comparisons in small numbers. This may be the case but as previously stated it cannot be completely 
excluded that the patient population enrolled in these two regions differs in some characteristics 
and/or that there are differences in the standard of care that may help to explain this observation. No 
further questions are raised as the overall results of the trial are considered.  
For the above mentioned subgroups of patients the MAH was requested to provide also the incidence of 
serious adverse events. The only trend clearly seen was the higher incidence of pulmonary 
exacerbations considered as serious adverse events reported for placebo-treated patients from North 
America (28.6% [6/21]) versus that reported for patients from Europe (0 events [0/16]). Five of these 
pulmonary exacerbations met the protocol definition of pulmonary exacerbation. The incidence in the 
ivacaftor group was similar in both regions (a serious pulmonary exacerbation in each region). The 
interpretation of the MAH was again that this may represent a chance finding when making multiple 
comparisons in relatively small samples. This may be the case but it cannot be completely excluded 
that the patient population enrolled in these two regions differs in some characteristics and/or that

there are differences in the standard of care that may help to explain this observation. As in the 
previous case the overall results of the trial are to be considered.  
Liver functions tests (LFT), haematology, chemistry and coagulation tests were collected at several 
study visits and analysed to describe changes in laboratory parameters over time and with treatment.  
Regarding liver function tests, 2 ivacaftor-treated patients reported an adverse event of increased 
alanine aminotransferase and increased GGT each. Both were considered by the investigator to be 
related or possibly related to ivacaftor. The analysis of the maximum on-treatment liver function tests 
results show that most ivacaftor-treated patients had ALT, AST and total bilirubin ≤ 2 x Upper Limit 
(94.7%, 100.0%, and 100.0%, respectively, on ivacaftor treatment and 91.9%, 97.3%, and 100.0%, 
respectively, on placebo treatment). During ivacaftor treatment, two (5.3%) patients had at least 1 
maximum ALT value >3 x ULN to ≤5 x ULN.  
During placebo treatment, 1 patient (2.7%) had a maximum on-treatment ALT and AST values >8 × 
ULN. Study drug was interrupted at Week 2 and resumed on Day 28, and the patient continued in the 
study with no further LFT increases.  
Plots of mean changes in liver function tests over time showed that with the exception of alkaline 
phosphatase all other LFT parameters suffered an increase that was in general higher in ivacaftor-
treated patients than in placebo patients. The magnitude of the increases was, however, limited.  
Changes in other chemistry parameters, haematology and coagulation were descriptively addressed by 
the MAH. The data provided (mean changes and shifts from normal to low and high values) do not 
suggest any specific pattern in the lab parameters discussed. 
There were no clinically important trends attributable to ivacaftor treatment identified in the standard 
digital ECGs and no adverse events associated with ECG abnormalities in study 111.  
No patients had adverse events that led to study drug interruption during ivacaftor treatment. During 
placebo treatment, 1 patient (2.7%) had an adverse event of increased hepatic enzymes that led to 
study drug interruption. As previously stated, the event resolved and the patient resumed dosing and 
continued in the study following the interruption. 
In conclusion, the safety profile of ivacaftor in patients with non-G551D gating mutations included in 
study 111 was consistent with that observed in studies 102 and 103 in patients with a G551D 
mutation. However, it was noted that in the literature20 describing the experience of the use of 
ivacaftor in 14 patients on a named patient program in Germany it has been reported that “increased 
bronchial secretions may warrant increased physiotherapy and intravenous antibiotic treatment in 
these patients when ivacaftor is initiated”. The MAH was asked to discuss whether in the clinical trials 
so far conducted, i.e. not limited to study 111, similar observations have been made (i.e. in close 
relationship with the start of ivacaftor treatment). Sputum increased was one of the commonly seen 
adverse events in previous trials. Overall, the MAH provided a comprehensive overview of the adverse 
events of interest, but the analysis was limited to patients with FEV1 below 40%. The safety profile of 
ivacaftor includes respiratory symptoms and signs such as sinus congestion, rhinitis, sputum increased, 
rhinorrhoea etc., all of them compatible with an increased hydration of the sinopulmonary secretions. 
This issue should be addressed in the successive PSURs and the discussion should not be limited to 
patients with FEV1 less than 40%.  
Further safety data will be gathered in the open label extension of study 111. The MAH also plans to 
rollover patients from study 111 to study 112 for an additional period of two years to generate long

2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
In conclusion, the safety profile of ivacaftor in cystic fibrosis patients aged 6 years and older with non-
G551D-CFTR gating mutations studied in Part 1 of trial 111 was consistent with that observed in 
studies 102 and 103 in patients with a G551D mutation. No new safety concerns emerge from the 
review of this safety data. There seems to be some differential effect between the two regions in the 
reporting of some adverse events, in particular pulmonary exacerbations that were more frequently 
reported by patients in the placebo group in North America. It is speculated that this may be the 
consequence of performing multiple comparisons in small numbers. This may well be the case but it 
cannot be completely ruled out that the patient population enrolled in the two regions differs in some 
characteristics and/or that there are differences in the standard of care that may help to explain this 
observation. The overall results of the trial should be considered and, therefore, no further issues are 
raised in this respect. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
The annex II related to the PSUR refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged.  
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management system version 2.7 is acceptable. In addition, 
minor revisions were recommended to be taken into account at the next RMP update. The 
PRAC endorsed PRAC Rapporteur assessment report is attached. 
The CHMP endorsed the PRAC advice without changes. The MAH consolidated the changes in the RMP 
introduced in other procedures concluding at the same time (variations II/0013 and II/0015/G). The 
CHMP endorsed the consolidated Risk Management Plan version 2.8.

As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have 
been updated. Particularly, a new warning with regard to lack of clinically relevant improvement from 
treatment in patients with G970R mutation in the CFTR gene has been added to the product 
information.  
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Ivacaftor 150 mg every 12 hours has been shown in a short-term, placebo-controlled cross-over study 
(Part 1 of study 111) to be statistically different from placebo in a number of efficacy variables 
including PPFEV1 in patients with cystic fibrosis with non-G551D-CFTR gating mutations included in this 
study. The primary endpoint was the mean absolute change from baseline in PPFEV1 which is the 
recommended primary clinical endpoint in efficacy studies for CF given that lung function in CF declines 
with age and is a significant predictor of mortality. The observed treatment difference (95%CI) 
between ivacaftor and placebo was 10.7 % (7.3, 14.1) and is not only statistically significant but also 
clinically relevant.  
Positive outcomes were also observed for the secondary endpoints mean absolute change from 
baseline in BMI and mean absolute change in the respiratory domain of the CFQ-R. These results were 
also statistically significant and consistent with the primary endpoint. The effect of ivacaftor on CFTR 
function was also assessed by the mean absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline through 8 
weeks, for which a statistically significant difference versus placebo was also observed.  
In conclusion, consistency has been observed not only between the primary and secondary endpoints 
in Part 1 of study 111 but also across studies, i.e. studies 102 and 103 in patients with a G551D 
mutation, another gating mutation for which ivacaftor is already indicated.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The efficacy of ivacaftor for patients with the studied non-G551D-CFTR gating mutations with mild to 
moderate lung disease has been shown in a limited number of patients (n=39) and for a short time. 
Therefore, efficacy data on the maintenance of the effect is lacking and is especially relevant given the 
chronic condition of the disease.  
The initially claimed indication covered all gating mutations despite that only a limited number of them 
have been characterised in vitro and assessed in vivo, i.e. G178R, S549N, S549R, G551S, G970R, 
G1244E, S1251N, S1255P, S1255P and G1349D. All of them are missense mutations for which the 
clinical consequences are difficult to anticipate. Concerns were raised regarding whether all of the 
mutations considered were disease-causing and also regarding the heterogeneity of the patient 
population enrolled in study 111 and patients with gating mutations in general.  
Narratives provided for patients with an unexpected small reduction in sweat chloride while on 
ivacaftor and analyses by specific non-G551D gating mutation showed that patients with a G970R-
CFTR mutation consistently respond to ivacaftor with a limited reduction in sweat chloride when 
compared to patients with other non-G551D gating mutations. The analysis also showed that indeed 
patients with a non-G551D gating mutation constitute a heterogeneous population in terms of clinical 
response to ivacaftor. As a consequence and in spite of the fact that an indication limited to the specific 
mutations assessed in study 111 was proposed by the MAH, it was considered that the G970R-CFTR 
mutation should not be part of the indication. The MAH latest proposal for section 4.1 of the SmPC is in 
line with this.  
The uncertainties about the exact mechanism of action (the interaction with CFTR protein) and lack of 
a demonstrated strong correlation between the in vitro and in vivo results for particular mutations at 
Kalydeco II-09  
EMA/CHMP/360053/2014 
Page 87/90 
 
 
 
 
 
present prevent considering potential in vitro data driven extrapolation of the demonstrated efficacy to 
other mutations. 
No suitable response guided therapy has been identified by the MAH as all the analyses performed 
suggest that there is no correlation between sweat chloride levels and changes in FEV1 improvement. 
As the dataset is still limited the MAH is encouraged to further pursue an understanding of potential 
relationships.  
Regarding the maintenance of the effect, the MAH performed a post-hoc analysis of the efficacy data of 
studies 102 and 103 (pivotal studies that assessed the efficacy and safety of ivacaftor for 48 weeks in 
patients with a G551D gating mutation) and have shown that the majority of patients who respond to 
ivacaftor at Week 8 keep this improvement at Week 24. This is also expected for patients with a non-
G551D gating mutation. The 16-week open label extension of study 11 could help to address whether 
the effect of ivacaftor is kept up to 24 weeks of treatment (8 weeks in the cross-over portion of the 
trial plus 16 weeks in the open label extension). This open-label extension has finished and the final 
CSR of study 111 is expected in June 2014. It should be made available as soon as possible. 
Furthermore, patients will be rolled over to an extension study (study 112) for an additional 2-year 
period after the last dose of study drug in study 111. Submission of results for studies 111 and 112 is 
foreseen in the RMP. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of ivacaftor in cystic fibrosis patients aged 6 years and older with a non-G551D-CFTR 
gating mutation in Part 1 of study 111 was consistent with that observed in studies 102 and 103 in 
patients with a G551D mutation. No new safety concerns emerge from the review of the safety data.  
The incidence of the following adverse events was higher in ivacaftor-treated patients than in placebo-
treated patients: rhinitis (7.9%), pyrexia (7.9%); fatigue and constipation were reported by 2 (5.3%) 
ivacaftor patients each; in the SOC Investigations 4 (10.5%) ivacaftor patients reported some adverse 
event versus 2 (5.4%) placebo patients. Arthralgia was reported by 2 (5.3%) ivacaftor patients.  
Sputum increased (considered treatment related) was reported by 2 (5.3%) ivacaftor-treated patients 
while none of the placebo patients reported this adverse reaction. Treatment-related investigations 
(increased ALT, increased blood creatinine, increased GGT) only occurred during ivacaftor treatment 
(5.3% [2 subjects]). 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
It is likely that the short-term duration of the trial limits the number of adverse events reported. 
Similarly, the low number of patients enrolled would make it difficult that the less frequent adverse 
reactions appear. Further safety data from the studies ongoing is expected to become available and 
will increase the safety database. 
Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in CF. Patients with CF 
typically experience a progressive loss of lung function ultimately resulting in respiratory failure and 
Kalydeco II-09  
EMA/CHMP/360053/2014 
Page 88/90 
 
 
 
 
 
death. The rate of decline in FEV1 may be variable depending on several factors such as genotype and 
environmental factors. Correlation between the genotype and the lung disease phenotype is 
particularly weak. CFTR mutations may cause CF or be associated with CFTR-related disorders but they 
also may have no clinical consequences or have unknown or uncertain clinical relevance. All of the non-
G551D gating mutations assessed in study 111 are missense mutations for which the clinical 
implications are difficult to assess. Narratives provided for patients with an unexpected small reduction 
in sweat chloride while on ivacaftor and analyses by specific non-G551D gating mutations show that 
patients with a G970R-CFTR mutation consistently respond to ivacaftor with a limited reduction in 
sweat chloride when compared to patients with other non-G551D gating mutations. As a consequence 
and in spite of the fact that an indication limited to the specific mutations assessed in study 111 was 
already proposed by the MAH, this was considered insufficient and the G970R-CFTR mutation was 
excluded from the proposed indication. 
However, the MAH expressed their concern that this mutation-by-mutation approach (rather than 
grouping them) would preclude the inclusion of new mutations in the labelling given their rarity. This is 
acknowledged, however, it would not be acceptable to ignore the results of ivacaftor in patients 
carrying the G970R mutation. Overall, the MAH is encouraged to further pursue the characterisation of 
the mechanism of action of ivacaftor as well as the identification of individual factors that may be 
predictive of response to it.  
The effect of ivacaftor in lung function (measured as FEV1% predicted) in a patient population with 
mild to moderate lung disease is clinically relevant in terms of the treatment effect observed. A smaller 
effect has been observed in children who are more likely to have a mild lung disease. This is not 
unexpected. Positive effects have been also observed on extrapulmonary outcomes such as BMI and 
quality of life. These effects are in line with what is already known for ivacaftor in patients with a 
G551D-CFTR mutation. The analysis by specific non-G551D mutation, however, showed that the 
magnitude of the response to ivacaftor varies among the different mutations likely reflecting the 
heterogeneity of this patient population.  
Although CF is a chronic condition the long-term data are limited. Nevertheless, post-hoc analyses 
performed in studies 102 and 103 in patients with a G551D gating mutation suggest that the majority 
of patients who respond to ivacaftor at Week 8 keep this improvement at Week 24. This is also 
expected for patients with a non-G551D gating mutation but needs to be confirmed. Results from the 
extension phase (Part 2) of study 111 could help to confirm the effect of ivacaftor up to 24 weeks of 
treatment.  
No new safety concerns have emerged from the review of the safety data of Part 1 of study 111. 
Overall, the safety profile is consistent with what is known for patients with a G551D gating mutation 
for whom data on the long term are available. There is no reason to believe that this would not be the 
case for patients with a non-G551D gating mutation but the open label extension of study 111 and the 
rollover study 112 will address this issue. 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
Cystic fibrosis represents an area of a high-unmet medical need for specific targeted therapies. In 
patients with cystic fibrosis lung function declines with age and is a significant predictor of mortality. 
Ivacaftor has been shown to improve lung function in patients with mild to moderate disease and the 
following gating mutations in the CFTR gene: G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, G970R, 
S1251N, S1255P, S549N, or S549R. Gating mutations as a group do not have high prevalence (when 
compared with the prevalence of F508del) and, consequently, the number of subjects who can benefit 
from treatment with ivacaftor for the time being is limited. 
Kalydeco II-09  
EMA/CHMP/360053/2014 
Page 89/90 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall, the results of Part 1 of study 111 demonstrate that patients with the non-G551D gating 
mutations mentioned above can be expected to benefit from treatment with ivacaftor, and these 
benefits outweigh the risks identified in the safety profile of the product, which in this population does 
not considerably differ from the profile in patients with G551D mutation (for which ivacaftor is already 
authorised). 
As previously discussed the therapeutic indication has been amended from an unrestricted indication to 
a more specific one to address the heterogeneity of the different mutations and the consistent findings 
that patients carrying the G970R-CFTR gating mutation respond less to ivacaftor. The MAH has agreed 
to that and the current proposal for section 4.1 of the SmPC is in line with this.  
The overall benefit/risk balance of Kalydeco in treatment of CF patients from age of 6 with respective 
gating mutations in the CFTR gene (G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N and 
S549R) is considered positive.  
In addition, the CHMP considered that the applicant should submit the following safety data the next 
PSUR: in future PSURs the MAH should analyse the events of increased respiratory secretions, not 
limiting the analysis to patients with FEV1 below 40% predicted. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP is of the opinion that Kalydeco is not similar to Bronchitol (mannitol) within the meaning of 
Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1. 
Final Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change(s):

As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been updated. 
Particularly, a new warning with regard to lack of clinically relevant improvement from treatment in 
patients with G970R mutation in the CFTR gene has been added to the product information. The 
Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the SmPC and Package Leaflet.

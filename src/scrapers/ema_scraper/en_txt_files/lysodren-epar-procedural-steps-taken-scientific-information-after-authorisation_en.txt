The MAH applied to remove the restriction of indication 
based on the results of the FIRM-ACT study. The PL

“The effect of Lysodren on non-functional adrenal cortical 
has been updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH

carcinoma is not established’’ thus for the use of mitotane 
took the opportunity to update the list of local 
representatives with Croatia in the Package Leaflet. 
Furthermore, the PI is being brought in line with the 
latest QRD template version 9. Finally the MAH made 
some editorial changes to the SmPC. 
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - 
in non-functional adrenal cortical carcinomas. 
This application was supported the FIRM-ACT (First 
International Randomized trial in locally advanced and 
Metastatic Adrenocortical Carcinoma Treatment) study. 
Further to the assessment of the CHMP and their 
conclusions as detailed in this report that this extension of 
the indication was not considered approvable, the MAH

Addition of a new therapeutic indication or 
modification of an approved one 
decided not to pursue with the proposed change to the 
indication. 
However, the CHMP agreed to the proposal from the MAH 
to update the sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC based 
on the results of the FIRM-ACT study.

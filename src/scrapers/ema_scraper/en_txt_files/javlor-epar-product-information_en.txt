CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Javlor is indicated in monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with advanced or metastatic 
transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelial tract after failure of a prior platinum-containing regimen 
Efficacy and safety of vinflunine have not been studied in patients with performance status ≥ 2. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Vinflunine treatment should be initiated under the responsibility of a physician qualified in the use of 
anticancer chemotherapy and is confined to units specialised in the administration of cytotoxic 
chemotherapy. 
Before each cycle, adequate monitoring of complete blood counts should be conducted to verify the 
absolute neutrophil count (ANC), platelets and haemoglobin as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and 
anaemia are frequent adverse reactions of vinflunine. 
Posology 
The recommended dose is 320 mg/m² vinflunine as a 20 minute intravenous infusion every 3 weeks. 
In case of  WHO/ECOG performance status (PS) of 1 or PS of 0 and prior pelvic irradiation, the 
treatment should be started at the dose of 280 mg/m². In the absence of any  haematological toxicity 
during the first cycle causing treatment delay or dose reduction, the dose will be increased to 
320 mg/m² every 3 weeks for the subsequent cycles. 
Recommended co-medication  
In order to prevent constipation, laxatives and dietary measures including oral hydration are 
recommended from day 1 to day 5 or 7 after each vinflunine administration (see section 4.4).

Special populations 
Patients with hepatic impairment  
A pharmacokinetic and tolerability phase I study in patients with altered liver functions test has been 
completed (see section 5.2). Vinflunine pharmacokinetics was not modified in those patients, however 
based on hepatic biologic parameter modifications following vinflunine administration (gamma 
glutamyl transferases (GGT), transaminases, bilirubin), the dose recommendations are as follows: 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- No dose adjustment is necessary in patients: 
- with a prothrombin time > 70% NV (Normal Value) and presenting at least one of the 
following criteria: [ ULN (Upper Limit of Normal) < bilirubin ≤ 1.5×ULN and/or 
1.5xULN < transaminases ≤ 2.5×ULN and/or ULN < GGT ≤ 5×ULN ]. 
- with transaminases ≤ 2.5xULN ( < 5xULN only in case of liver metastases). 
- The recommended dose of vinflunine is 250 mg/m² given once every 3 weeks in patients with mild 
liver impairment (Child-Pugh grade A) or in patients with a prothrombin time ≥ 60% NV and 
1.5×ULN < bilirubin ≤ 3×ULN and presenting at least one of the following criteria:  
[ transaminases > ULN and/or GGT > 5×ULN ]. 
- The recommended dose of vinflunine is 200 mg/m² given once every 3 weeks in patients with 
moderate liver impairment (Child-Pugh grade B) or in patients with a prothrombin time ≥ 50% NV 
and bilirubin > 3×ULN and transaminases > ULN and GGT > ULN. 
Vinflunine has not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh grade C), or 
in patients with a prothrombin time < 50%NV or with bilirubin > 5xULN or with isolated 
transaminases > 2.5xULN ( ≥ 5xULN only in case of liver metastases) or with GGT > 15xULN. 
Patients with renal impairment 
In clinical studies, patients with CrCl (creatinine clearance) > 60 mL/min were included and treated at 
the recommended dose. 
In patients with moderate renal impairment (40 mL/min ≤ CrCl≤ 60 mL/min), the recommended dose 
is 280 mg/m² given once every 3 weeks.  
In patients with severe renal impairment (20 mL/min ≤ CrCl < 40 mL/min) the recommended dose is 
250 mg/m² every 3 weeks (see section 5.2). 
For further cycles, the dose should be adjusted in the event of toxicities, as shown in table 3 below. 
Elderly patients (≥ 75 years) 
No age-related dose modification is required in patients less than 75 years old (see section 5.2).  
The doses recommended in patients of at least 75 years old are as follows: 
- in patients of at least 75 years old but less than 80 years, the dose of vinflunine to be given is 
280 mg/m² every 3 weeks. 
- in patients 80 years old and above, the dose of vinflunine to be given is 250 mg/m² every 3 weeks.  
For further cycles, the dose should be adjusted in the event of toxicities, as shown in table 3 below:

Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of Javlor in the paediatric population. 
Method of administration 
Precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product 
Javlor must be diluted prior to administration. Javlor is for single use only. 
For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
Javlor MUST ONLY be administered intravenously.  
Javlor should be administered by a 20-minute intravenous infusion and NOT be given by rapid 
intravenous bolus. 
Either peripheral lines or a central catheter can be used for vinflunine administration. When infused 
through a peripheral vein, vinflunine can induce venous irritation (see section 4.4). In case of small or 
sclerosed veins, lymphoedema or recent venipuncture of the same vein, the use of a central catheter 
may be preferred. To avoid extravasations it is important to be sure that the needle is correctly 
introduced before starting the infusion. 
In order to flush the vein, administration of diluted Javlor should always be followed by at least an 
equal volume of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for infusion or of glucose 50 mg/mL (5%) 
solution for infusion.  
For detailed instructions on administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or other vinca alkaloids. 
Recent (within 2 weeks) or current severe infection. 
Baseline ANC < 1,500/mm3 for the first administration, baseline ANC < 1,000/mm3 for subsequent 
administrations (see section 4.4). 
Platelets < 100,000/mm3(see section 4.4). 
Breast-feeding (see section 4.6). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Hematological toxicity 
Neutropenia, leucopenia, anaemia and thrombocytopenia are frequent adverse reactions of vinflunine. 
Adequate monitoring of complete blood counts should be conducted to verify the ANC, platelet and 
haemoglobin values before each vinflunine infusion (see section 4.3). 
Initiation of vinflunine is contraindicated in subjects with baseline ANC < 1,500/mm3 or 
platelets < 100,000/mm3. For subsequent administrations, vinflunine is contraindicated in subjects 
with baseline ANC < 1,000/mm3 or platelets < 100,000/mm3. 
The recommended dose should be reduced in patients with haematological toxicity (see section 4.2). 
Gastrointestinal disorders 
Grade ≥ 3 constipation occurred in 15.3% of treated patients. NCI CTC Grade 3 constipation is 
defined as an obstipation requiring manual evacuation or enema, Grade 4 constipation as an 
obstruction or toxic megacolon. Constipation is reversible and can be prevented by special dietary 
measures such as oral hydration and fibre intake, and by administration of laxatives such as stimulant 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
laxatives or faecal softners from day 1 to day 5 or 7 of the treatment cycle. Patients at high risk of 
constipation (concomitant treatment with opiates, peritoneal carcinomas, abdominal masses, prior 
major abdominal surgery) should be medicated with an osmotic laxative from day 1 to day 7 
administered once a day in the morning before breakfast.  
In case of Grade 2 constipation, defined as requiring laxatives, for 5 days or more or Grade ≥ 3 of any 
duration, the dose of vinflunine should be adjusted (see section 4.2).  
In case of any Grade ≥ 3 gastrointestinal toxicity (except vomiting or nausea) or of mucositis (Grade 2 
for 5 days or more or Grade ≥ 3 of any duration) dose adjustment is required. Grade 2 is defined as 
“moderate”, Grade 3 as “severe” and Grade 4 as “life-threatening” (see Table 2 in section 4.2).  
Cardiac disorders 
Few QT interval prolongations have been observed after the administration of vinflunine. This effect 
may lead to an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias although no ventricular arrhythmias were 
observed with vinflunine. Nevertheless, vinflunine should be used with caution in patients with 
increase of the proarrhythmic risk (e.g. congestive heart failure, known history of QT interval 
prolongation, hypokalaemia) (see section 4.8). The concomittant use of two or more QT/QTc interval 
prolonging substances is not recommended (see section 4.5). 
Special attention is recommended when vinflunine is administered to patients with prior history of 
myocardial infarction/ischaemia or angina pectoris (see section 4.8). Ischaemic cardiac events may 
occur, especially in patients who have underlying cardiac disease. Thus, patients receiving Javlor 
should be vigilantly monitored by physicians for the occurrence of cardiac events. Caution should be 
exercised in patients with a history of cardiac disease and the benefit / risk assessment should be 
carefully evaluated regularly. Discontinuation of vinflunine should be considered in patients who 
develop cardiac ischaemia. 
Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) 
Cases of PRES have been observed after administration of vinflunine. 
The typical clinical symptoms are, with various degrees: neurological (headache, confusion, seizure, 
visual disorders), systemic (hypertension), and gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting). 
Radiological signs are white matter abnormalities in the posterior regions of the brain. Blood pressure 
should be controlled in patients developing symptoms of PRES. To confirm the diagnosis, brain 
imaging is recommended.  
Clinical and radiological features usually resolved rapidly without sequelae after treatment 
discontinuation. 
Discontinuation of vinflunine should be considered in patients who develop neurological signs of 
PRES (see section 4.8). 
Hyponatraemia 
Severe  hyponatraemia,  including  cases  due  to  syndrome  of  inappropriate  antidiuretic  hormone 
secretion (SIADH), has been observed with the use of vinflunine (see section 4.8). Therefore, regular 
monitoring of serum sodium levels is recommended during treatment with vinflunine.   
Hepatic impairment 
The recommended dose should be reduced in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 4.2). 
Renal impairment 
The recommended dose should be reduced in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (see 
section 4.2). 
Elderly patients (≥ 75 years) 
The recommended dose should be reduced in patients 75 years old and beyond (see section 4.2). 
Interactions 
The concomitant use of potent inhibitors or potent inducers of CYP3A4 with vinflunine should be 
avoided (see section 4.5). 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Administration 
Intrathecal administration of Javlor may be fatal. 
When infused through a peripheral vein, vinflunine can induce Grade 1 (22% of the patients, 14.1% of 
the cycles), Grade 2 (11.0% of the patients, 6.8% of the cycles) or Grade 3 (0.8% of the patients, 0.2% 
of the cycles) venous irritation. All cases resolved rapidly without treatment discontinuation.  
Instructions for administration should be followed as described in section 6.6. 
Contraception 
Men and women with reproductive potential must use an effective method of contraception during the 
treatment and up to 3 months after the last vinflunine administration (see section 4.6). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
In vitro studies showed that vinflunine had neither inducing effects on CYP1A2, CYP2B6 or CYP3A4 
activity nor inhibition effects on CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and 
CYP3A4. 
In vitro studies showed that vinflunine is a Pgp-substrate like other vinca alkaloids, but with a lower 
affinity. Therefore, risks of clinically significant interactions should be unlikely. 
No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed in patients when vinflunine was combined with either 
cisplatin, carboplatin, capecitabine or gemcitabine. 
No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed in patients when vinflunine was combined with 
doxorubicin. However, this combination was associated with a particularly high risk of haematological 
toxicity. 
A phase I study evaluating the effect of ketoconazole treatment (a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor) on 
vinflunine pharmacokinetics indicated that co-administration of ketoconazole (400 mg orally once 
daily for 8 days) resulted in a 30% and 50% increase in blood exposures to vinflunine and its 
metabolite 4Odeacetyl-vinflunine (DVFL), respectively. 
Therefore the concomitant use of vinflunine and potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir, 
ketoconazole, itraconazole and grapefruit juice) or inducers (such as rifampicin and Hypericum 
perforatum (St John’s wort)) should be avoided since they may increase or decrease vinflunine and 
DVFL concentrations (see section 4.4 and 5.2).  
The concomitant use of vinflunine with others QT/QTc interval prolonging medicinal products should 
be avoided (see section 4.4). 
A pharmacokinetic interaction between vinflunine and pegylated/liposomal doxorubicin was observed, 
resulting in a 15% to 30% apparent increase in vinflunine exposure and a 2 to 3-fold apparent decrease 
of doxorubicin AUC, whereas for doxorubicinol, the concentrations of the metabolite were not 
affected. According to an in vitro study, such changes could be related to adsorption of vinflunine on 
the liposomes and a modified blood distribution of both compounds. Therefore, caution should be 
excercised when this type of combination is used. 
A possible interaction with paclitaxel and docetaxel (CYP3 substrates) has been suggested from an in 
vitro study (slight inhibition of vinflunine metabolism). No specific clinical studies of vinflunine in 
combination with these compounds have been carried out yet. 
The concomitant use of opioids could enhance the risk of constipation.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Contraception in males and females 
Both male and female patients should take adequate contraceptive measures up to three months after 
the discontinuation of the therapy.  
Pregnancy 
There are no data available on the use of vinflunine in pregnant women. Studies in animals have 
shown embryotoxicity and teratogenicity (see section 5.3). On the basis of the results of animal studies 
and the pharmacological action of the medicinal product, there is a potential risk of embryonic and 
foetal abnormalities. 
Vinflunine should therefore not be used during pregnancy, unless it is strictly necessary. If pregnancy 
occurs during treatment, the patient should be informed about the risk for the unborn child and be 
monitored carefully. The possibility of genetic counselling should be considered. Genetic counselling 
is also recommended for patients wishing to have children after therapy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether vinflunine or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Due to the possible 
very harmful effects on the infants, breast-feeding during treatment with vinflunine is contraindicated 
(see section 4.3).  
Fertility  
Advice on conservation of sperm should be sought prior to treatment because of the possibility of 
irreversible infertility due to therapy with vinflunine. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Javlor may cause adverse reactions such as fatigue (very common) and dizziness (common) which 
may lead to a minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines..Patients should be 
advised not to drive or use machines if they experience any adverse reaction with a potential impact on 
the ability to perform these activities (see section 4.8). 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most frequent treatment-related adverse reactions reported in the two phase II and one phase III 
trials in patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium (450 patients treated with 
vinflunine) were haematological disorders, mainly neutropenia and anaemia; gastrointestinal 
disorders, especially constipation, anorexia, nausea, stomatitis/mucositis, vomiting, abdominal pain 
and diarrhoea, and general disorders such as asthenia/fatigue. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions are listed below by System Organ Class, frequency and grade of severity (NCI CTC 
version 2.0). Frequency of adverse reactions is defined using the following convention: very common 
(≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to 
< 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from available data). Within each 
frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

patients with other disease than this indication and potentially severe or adverse reactions that are a 
class effect of the vinca alkaloids are described below: 
Blood and lymphatic system disorders 
Grade 3/4 neutropenia was observed in 43.8% of patients. Severe anaemia and thrombocytopenia were 
less common (respectively 8.8 and 3.1 %). Febrile neutropenia defined as ANC < 1,000/mm3and 
fever ≥ 38.5°C of unknown origin without clinically microbiologically documented infection (NCI 
CTC version 2.0) was observed in 5.2% of patients. Infection with Grade 3/4 neutropenia was 
observed in 2.8% of patients. 
10 
 
 
Overall 8 patients (0.6% of the treated population) died from infection as a complication occurring 
during neutropenia. 
Gastrointestinal disorders 
Constipation is a class effect of the vinca alkaloids: 11.8% of patients experienced severe constipation 
during treatment with vinflunine. Grade 3/4 ileus reported in 1.9% of patients was reversible when 
managed by medical care. Constipation is managed by medical care (see section 4.4). 
Nervous system disorders 
Sensory peripheral neuropathy is a class effect of the vinca alkaloids. Grade 3 was experienced by 
0.6% patients. All resolved during the study. 
Rare cases of Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome have been reported (see section 4.4). 
Cardiovascular disorders 
Cardiac effects are a known class effect of the vinca alkaloids. Myocardial infarction or ischaemia 
were experienced by 0.5% of the patients and most of them had a pre-existing cardiovascular disease 
or risk factors. One patient died after myocardial infarction and another one due to a cardiopulmonary 
arrest. 
Few QT interval prolongations have been observed after the administration of vinflunine. 
Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders 
Dyspnoea occurred in 3.2% of the patients but was rarely severe (Grade 3/4: 1.2%). 
Bronchospam was reported in one patient treated with vinflunine for a different setting from the 
indication. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions  
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V 
4.9  Overdose 
The main toxic effect due to an overdose with vinflunine is bone marrow suppression with a risk of 
severe infection. 
There is no known antidote for vinflunine overdose. In case of overdose, the patient should be kept in 
a specialised unit and vital functions should be closely monitored. Other appropriate measures should 
be taken, such as blood transfusions, administration of antibiotics and growth factors. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplasic agents, vinca alkaloids and analogues, ATC code: 
L01CA05 
Mechanism of action 
Vinflunine binds to tubulin at or near to the vinca binding sites inhibiting its polymerisation into 
microtubules, which results in treadmilling suppression, disruption of microtubule dynamic, mitotic 
arrest and apoptosis. In vivo, vinflunine displays significant antitumor activity against a broad 
spectrum of human xenografts in mice both in terms of survival prolongation and tumour growth 
inhibition.

Clinical efficacy and safety 
One phase III and two phase II trials support the use of Javlor for treatment of advanced or metastatic 
transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium as second-line therapy after failure of a prior platinum-
containing regimen. 
In the two multi-centre open-label, single-arm phase II clinical trials a total of 202 patients were 
treated with vinflunine. 
In the multi-centre, open-label controlled phase III clinical trial, 253 patients were randomised to 
treatment with vinflunine + BSC (best supportive care) and 117 patients to the BSC arm.  
The median overall survival was 6.9 months (vinflunine + BSC) vs. 4.6 months (BSC), but the 
difference did not reach statistical significance; hazard ratio 0.88 (95% CI 0.69, 1.12). However a 
statistically significant effect was seen on progression-free survival. Median PFS was 3.0 months 
(vinflunine + BSC) vs 1.5 months (BSC) (p=0.0012). 
In addition a pre-specified multivariate analysis performed on the ITT population demonstrated that 
vinflunine had a statistically significant treatment effect (p=0.036) on overall survival when prognostic 
factors (PS, visceral involvement, alkaline phosphatases, haemoglobin, pelvic irradiation) were taken 
into consideration; hazard ratio 0.77 (95% CI 0.61, 0.98). A statistically significant difference on 
overall survival (p=0.040) was also seen in the eligible population (which excluded 13 patients with 
clinically significant protocol violations at baseline who were not eligible for treatment); hazard 
ratio 0.78 (95% CI 0.61, 0.99). This is considered the most relevant population for the efficacy 
analysis, as it most closely reflects the population intended for treatment.  
Efficacy was demonstrated in both patients with or without prior cisplatin use.  
In the eligible population, the subgroup analyses according to the prior cisplatin use versus BSC on 
overall survival (OS) showed a HR (95% CI) = [0.64 (0.40 – 1.03); p=0.0821] in the absence of prior 
cisplatin, and a HR (95% CI) = [0.80 (0.60 – 1.06); p=0.1263] in the presence of prior cisplatin. When 
adjusted on prognostic factors, the analyses of OS in the subgroups of patients without or with prior 
cisplatin showed a HR (95% CI) = [0.53 (0.32 – 0.88); p=0.0143] and a HR (95% CI) = [0.70 (0.53 – 
0.94); p=0.0174], respectively. 
In the subgroup analyses of prior cisplatin use versus BSC for progression free survival (PFS), the 
results were: HR (95% CI) = [0.55 (0.34 – 0.89); p=0.0129] in the absence of prior cisplatin, and a HR 
(95% CI) = [0.64 (0.48 – 0.85); p=0.0040] in the presence of prior cisplatin. When adjusted on 
prognostic factors, the analyses of PFS in the subgroups of patients without or with prior cisplatin 
showed a HR (95% CI) = [0.51(0.31 – 0.86); p=0.0111] and a HR (95% CI) = [0.63(0.48 – 0.84); 
p=0.0016], respectively. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Javlor 
in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of ureter and bladder carcinoma and the 
treatment of breast carcinoma (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties 
Vinflunine pharmacokinetics is linear in the range of administered doses (from 30 mg/m² to 
400 mg/m2) in cancer patients. 
Blood exposure to vinflunine (AUC), significantly correlated with severity of leucopenia, neutropenia 
and fatigue. 
Distribution  
Vinflunine is moderately bound to human plasma proteins (67.2±1.1%) with a ratio between plasma 
and whole blood concentrations of 0.80±0.12. Protein binding mainly involves high density 
lipoproteins and serum albumin and is non-saturable on the range of vinflunine concentrations 
observed in patients. Binding to alpha-1 acid glycoprotein and to platelets is negligible (< 5%). 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The terminal volume of distribution is large, 2422±676 litres (about 35 l/kg) suggesting extensive 
distribution  into tissues.  
Biotransformation 
All metabolites identified are formed by the cytochrome CYP3A4 isoenzyme, except for 
4-O-deacetylvinflunine (DVFL), the only active metabolite and main metabolite in blood which is 
formed by multiple esterases.  
Elimination  
Vinflunine is eliminated following a multi-exponential concentration decay, with a terminal half-life 
(t1/2) close to 40 h. DVFL is slowly formed and more slowly eliminated than vinflunine (t1/2 of 
approximately 120 h). 
The excretion of vinflunine and its metabolites occurs through faeces (2/3) and urine (1/3).  
In a population pharmacokinetic analysis in 372 patients (656 pharmacokinetic profiles), the total 
blood clearance was 40 L/h with low inter and intra-individual variability (25% and 8%, respectively, 
expressed as coefficient of variation). 
Pharmacokinetics in special populations 
Hepatic impairment 
No modification of vinflunine and DVFL pharmacokinetics was observed in 25 patients presenting 
varying degrees of hepatic impairment, compared to patients with normal hepatic function. This was 
further confirmed by the population pharmacokinetic analysis (absence of relationship between 
vinflunine clearance and biology markers of hepatic impairment). However, dose adjustments are 
recommended in patients with liver impairment (see section 4.2).  
Renal impairment 
A pharmacokinetic phase I study was performed in 2 groups of patients with renal impairment 
classified according to the calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) values: group 1 (n=13 patients) with 
moderate impairment (40 mL/min ≤ CrCl ≤ 60 mL/min) and group 2 (n=20 patients) with severe 
impairment (20 mL/min ≤ CrCl < 40 mL/min). The pharmacokinetic results of this study indicated a 
reduction of vinflunine clearance when CrCl is decreased. This is further confirmed by the population 
pharmacokinetic analysis (56 patients with CrCl between 20 mL/min and 60 mL/min), showing that 
vinflunine clearance is influenced by the creatinine clearance value (Cockcroft and Gault formula). 
Dose adjustments are recommended in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment (see 
section 4.2).  
Elderly (≥ 75 years) 
A pharmacokinetic phase I study of vinflunine was performed in elderly patients (n=46). Vinflunine 
doses were adjusted according to 3 age groups as shown below:  
Age (y) 
[ 70 – 75 [   
[ 75 – 80 [ 
≥ 80 
Number of 
patients 
17 
15 
14 
Vinflunine (mg/m²) 
320 
280 
250 
Vinflunine clearance was significantly decreased in patients ≥ 80 years old as compared to a control 
group of younger patients < 70 years.  
Pharmacokinetics of vinflunine was not modified for patients 70 ≤ age < 75 years and 
75 ≤ age < 80 years.  
Based on both PK and safety data, dose reductions are recommended in the elder groups: 
75 ≤ age < 80 years; and age ≥ 80 years.  
For further cycles the dose should be adjusted in the event of toxicities (see section 4.2).  
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Others 
According to the population pharmacokinetic analysis, neither gender nor performance status (ECOG 
score) had an impact on vinflunine clearance which is directly proportional to body surface area. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Imaging distribution studies following radioactive vinflunine in rats, illustrated that the compound 
levels in lungs, kidneys, liver, salivary and endocrine glands, and gastrointestinal tract were rapidly 
higher than those in blood.  
Preclinical data revealed moderate to severe neutropenia and mild anaemia, in all species tested, with  
liver toxicity in dogs and rats (characterized by dose-dependent increases in liver transaminases and 
hepatic necrosis/hepatocellular alterations at high doses). These toxic effects were dose-related and 
fully or-partially reversible following a 1-month recovery period. Vinflunine did not induce peripheral 
neuropathy in animals. 
Vinflunine has shown to be clastogenic (induces chromosome breakage) in the in vivo micronucleus 
test in rat as well as mutagenic and clastogenic in a mouse lymphoma assay (without metabolic 
activation). 
The carcinogenic potential of vinflunine has not been studied.  
In the reproduction studies, vinflunine appeared to be embryolethal and teratogenic in rabbits and 
teratogenic in rats. During the pre- and post-natal development study in rat, vinflunine induced 
malformations of the uterus and vagina in 2 females, and adversely affected mating and/or ovule 
implantation and markedly lowered the number of concepti.

Not all pack sizes may be marketed. 
6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
General precautions for preparation and administration. 
Vinflunine is a cytotoxic anticancer medicinal product and, as with other potentially toxic compounds, 
caution should be exercised in handling Javlor. Procedure for proper handling and disposal of 
anticancer medicinal products should be considered. All transfer procedures require strict adherence to 
aseptic techniques, preferably employing a vertical laminar flow safety hood. Javlor solution for 
infusion should only be prepared and administered by personnel appropriately trained in the handling 
of cytotoxic agents. Pregnant staff should not handle Javlor. The use of gloves, goggles and protective 
clothing is recommended. 
If the solution comes into contact with the skin, this should be washed immediately and thoroughly 
with soap and water. If it comes into contact with mucous membranes, the membranes should be 
flushed  thoroughly with water.  
Dilution of the concentrate  
The volume of Javlor (concentrate) corresponding to the calculated dose of vinflunine should be 
mixed in a 100 mL bag of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for infusion. Glucose 50 mg/mL 
(5%) solution for infusion may also be used. The diluted solution should be protected from light until 
administration (see section 6.3). 
Method of administration 
Javlor is for intravenous use ONLY. 
Javlor is for single use only. 
After dilution of the Javlor concentrate, the solution for infusion will be administered as follows: 
•  A venous access should be established for a 500 mL bag of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) 
solution for injection or glucose 50 mg/mL (5%) solution for infusion, on a large vein 
preferably in the upper part of the forearm or using a central venous line. The veins of the 
hand dorsum and those close to joints should be avoided. 
•  The intravenous infusion should be started with half of the 500 mL bag of sodium chloride 
9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for infusion or of glucose 50 mg/mL (5%) solution for infusion, i.e. 
250 mL, at a free flowing rate to flush the vein. 
•  The Javlor solution for infusion should be piggy-backed to the side injection port closest to the 
500 mL bag to further dilute Javlor during administration.  
•  The Javlor solution for infusion should be infused over 20 minutes. 
•  The patency should be assessed frequently and extravasation precautions should be 
maintained throughout the infusion. 
•  After the infusion is completed, the remaining 250 mL from the sodium chloride 9 mg/mL 
(0.9%) solution for infusion or of glucose 50 mg/mL (5%) solution for infusion bag should be 
run at a flowing rate of 300 mL/h. In order to flush the vein, administration of Javlor solution 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
for infusion should always be followed by at least an equal volume of sodium chloride 
9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for infusion or of glucose 50 mg/mL (5%) solution for infusion. 
Disposal 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements for cytotoxic medicinal products.

Content of the pack and other information 
1.  What Javlor is and what it is used for 
Javlor contains the active substance vinflunine, which belongs to a group of anticancer medicines 
called  vinca alkaloids. These medicines affect cancer cell growth by stopping cell division, leading to 
cell death (cytotoxicity). 
Javlor is used to treat advanced or metastatic cancer of the bladder and urinary tract when a previous 
therapy with platinum-containing medicines has failed. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Javlor 
Do not use Javlor 
- 
if you are allergic to the active substance (vinflunine) or to other vinca alkaloids (vinblastine, 
vincristine, vindesine, vinorelbine), 
 if you have had (in the last 2 weeks) or currently have a severe infection, 
if you are breast-feeding, 
if your levels of white blood cells and/or platelets are too low 
Warnings and precautions 
Tell your doctor: 
- 
- 
if you have liver, kidney or heart problems, 
if you experience any neurological symptoms such as headaches, changed mental state which may 
lead to confusion and coma, convulsions, blurred vision and high blood pressure as you may need 
to stop taking this medicine, 
if you are taking other medicines mentioned in “Using other medicines” below, 
if you have constipation, or if you are treated with medicines against pain (opioids), or if you have 
an abdominal cancer, or if you had abdominal surgery, 
if you would like to father a child (see “Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility” below). 
Your blood cell counts will be checked regularly before and during your treatment, since low counts 
of blood cells is a very common side effect with Javlor. 
Constipation is a very common side effect of Javlor. To prevent constipation you may be given 
laxatives.

The following information is intended for medical or healthcare professionals only: 
INSTRUCTION FOR USE 
General precautions for preparation and administration. 
Vinflunine is a cytotoxic anticancer medicinal product and, as with other potentially toxic compounds, 
caution should be exercised in handling Javlor. Procedure for proper handling and disposal of 
anticancer medicinal products should be considered. All transfer procedures require strict adherence to 
aseptic techniques, preferably employing a vertical laminar flow safety hood. Javlor solution for 
infusion should only be prepared and administered by personnel appropriately trained in the handling 
of cytotoxic agents. Pregnant staff should not handle Javlor. The use of gloves, goggles and protective 
clothing is recommended. 
If the solution comes into contact with the skin, this should be washed immediately and thoroughly 
with soap and water. If it comes into contact with mucous membranes, the membranes should be 
flushed  thoroughly with water.  
Dilution of the concentrate  
The volume of Javlor (concentrate) corresponding to the calculated dose of vinflunine should be 
mixed in a 100 mL bag of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for infusion. Glucose 50 mg/mL 
(5%) solution for infusion may also be used. The diluted solution should be protected from light until 
administration (see section 6.3). 
Method of administration 
Javlor is for intravenous use ONLY. 
Javlor is for single use only.  
After dilution of the Javlor concentrate, the solution for infusion will be administered as follows: 
•  A venous access should be established for a 500 mL bag of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) 
solution for injection or glucose 50 mg/mL (5%) solution for infusion, on a large vein 
preferably in the upper part of the forearm or using a central venous line. The veins of the 
hand dorsum and those close to joints should be avoided. 
•  The intravenous infusion should be started with half of the 500 mL bag of sodium chloride 
9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for infusion or of glucose 50 mg/mL (5%) solution for infusion, i.e. 
250 mL, at a free flowing rate to flush the vein. 
•  The Javlor solution for infusion should be piggy-backed to the side injection port closest to the 
500 mL bag to further dilute Javlor during administration.  
•  The Javlor solution for infusion should be infused over 20 minutes. 
•  The patency should be assessed frequently and extravasation precautions should be 
maintained throughout the infusion. 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  After the infusion is completed, the remaining 250 mL from the sodium chloride 9 mg/mL 
(0.9%) solution for infusion or of glucose 50 mg/mL (5%) solution for infusion bag should be 
run at a flowing rate of 300 mL/h. In order to flush the vein, administration of Javlor solution 
for infusion should always be followed by at least an equal volume of sodium chloride 
9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for infusion or of glucose 50 mg/mL (5%) solution for infusion. 
Disposal 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements for cytotoxic medicinal products.

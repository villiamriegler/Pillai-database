the combination of liver stiffness measurement and a blood test improves accuracy and should be undertaken 
prior to 8 week treatment in all patients with moderate fibrosis.
For specific dosage instructions for dasabuvir and ribavirin, including dose modification, refer to the 
respective Summaries of Product Characteristics.
Missed doses
In case a dose of Viekirax is missed, the prescribed dose can be taken within 12 hours. If more than 12 
hours have passed since Viekirax is usually taken, the missed dose should NOT be taken and the patient 
should take the next dose per the usual dosing schedule. Patients should be instructed not to take a double 
dose.
Special populations
HIV-1 Co-infection
The dosing recommendations in Table 1 should be followed. For dosing recommendations with HIV 
antiviral medicinal products, refer to sections 4.4 and 4.5. See sections 4.8 and 5.1 for additional 
information.
Liver transplant recipients 
Viekirax and dasabuvir in combination with ribavirin is recommended for 24 weeks in liver transplant 
recipients with genotype 1 HCV infection. Viekirax in combination with ribavirin is recommended in
genotype 4 infection. Lower ribavirin dose at initiation may be appropriate. In the post-liver transplant 
study, ribavirin dosing was individualized and most subjects received 600 to 800 mg per day (see section 
5.1). For dosing recommendations with calcineurin inhibitors see section 4.5. 
Elderly
No dose adjustment of Viekirax is warranted in elderly patients (see section 5.2).
3
Renal impairment
No dose adjustment of Viekirax is required for patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment, 
or end-stage-renal disease on dialysis (see section 5.2). For patients that require ribavirin, refer to the 
ribavirin Summary of Product Characteristics for information regarding use in patients with renal 
impairment.
Hepatic impairment
No dose adjustment of Viekirax is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A). 
Viekirax is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C)
(see sections 4.3 and 5.2).
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of Viekirax in children less than 18 years of age have not been established. No 
data are available.
Method of administration
The film-coated tablets are for oral use. Patients should be instructed to swallow the tablets whole (i.e. 
patients should not chew, break or dissolve the tablet). To maximise absorption, Viekirax tablets should be 
taken with food, without regard to fat and calorie content (see section 5.2).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
Patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C) (see section 5.2).
Use of ethinyloestradiol-containing medicinal products such as those contained in most combined oral 
contraceptives or contraceptive vaginal rings (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).
Medicinal products that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma 
levels are associated with serious events must not be co-administered with Viekirax (see section 4.5).
Examples are provided below.
CYP3A4 substrates:
 alfuzosin hydrochloride
 amiodarone, disopyramide, dronedarone, quinidine, ranolazine
 astemizole, terfenadine

 ticagrelor
4
Co-administration of Viekirax with or without dasabuvir with medicinal products that are strong or 
moderate enzyme inducers is expected to decrease ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir plasma 
concentrations and reduce their therapeutic effect and must not be co-administered (see section 4.5). 
Examples of contraindicated strong or moderate enzyme inducers are provided below. 
Enzyme inducers:
 carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital
 efavirenz, nevirapine, etravirine
 apalutamide,enzalutamide
 mitotane
 rifampicin 
 St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum)
Co-administration of Viekirax with or without dasabuvir with medicinal products that are strong inhibitors 
of CYP3A4 is expected to increase paritaprevir plasma concentrations and must not be co-administered 
with Viekirax (see section 4.5). Examples of contraindicated strong CYP3A4 inhibitors are provided 
below.
CYP3A4 inhibitors:
 cobicistat
 indinavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, saquinavir, tipranavir, 
 itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole
 clarithromycin, telithromycin
 conivaptan
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
General
Viekirax is not recommended for administration as monotherapy and must be used in combination with 
other medicinal products for the treatment of hepatitis C infection (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).
Risk of hepatic decompensation and hepatic failure in patients with cirrhosis
Hepatic decompensation and hepatic failure, including liver transplantation or fatal outcomes, have been 
reported postmarketing in patients treated with Viekirax with and without dasabuvir and with and without 
ribavirin. Most patients with these severe outcomes had evidence of advanced or decompensated cirrhosis 
prior to initiating therapy. Although causality is difficult to establish due to background advanced liver 
disease, a potential risk cannot be excluded.
Viekirax is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C) 
(see sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.8 and 5.2).
For patients with cirrhosis:
• Monitoring should be performed for clinical signs and symptoms of hepatic decompensation (such 
as ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, variceal haemorrhage).
• Hepatic laboratory testing including direct bilirubin levels should be performed at baseline, during 
the first 4 weeks of starting treatment and as clinically indicated thereafter.
• Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop evidence of hepatic decompensation.
5
ALT elevations
During clinical trials with Viekirax and dasabuvir with or without ribavirin, transient elevations of ALT to 
greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal occurred in approximately 1% of subjects (35 of 3,039). 
ALT elevations were asymptomatic and generally occurred during the first 4 weeks of treatment, without 
concomitant elevations of bilirubin, and declined within approximately two weeks of onset with continued 
dosing of Viekirax and dasabuvir with or without ribavirin. 
These ALT elevations were significantly more frequent in the subgroup of subjects who were using 
ethinyloestradiol-containing medicinal products such as combined oral contraceptives or contraceptive 
vaginal rings (6 of 25 subjects); (see section 4.3). In contrast, the rate of ALT elevations in subjects using 
other types of oestrogens as typically used in hormonal replacement therapy (i.e., oral and topical 
oestradiol and conjugated oestrogens) was similar to the rate observed in subjects who were not using 
oestrogen-containing products (approximately 1% in each group). 
Patients who are taking ethinyloestradiol-containing medicinal products (i.e. most combined oral 
contraceptives or contraceptive vaginal rings) must switch to an alternative method of contraception (e.g., 
progestin only contraception or non-hormonal methods) prior to initiating Viekirax with or without
dasabuvir therapy (see sections 4.3 and 4.5).
Although ALT elevations associated with Viekirax and dasabuvir have been asymptomatic, patients 
should be instructed to watch for early warning signs of liver inflammation, such as fatigue, weakness, 
lack of appetite, nausea and vomiting, as well as later signs such as jaundice and discoloured faeces, and 
to consult a doctor without delay if such symptoms occur. Routine monitoring of liver enzymes is not 
necessary in patients that do not have cirrhosis (for cirrhotics, see above). Early discontinuation may result 
in drug resistance, but implications for future therapy are not known.
Pregnancy and concomitant use with ribavirin
Also see section 4.6. 
Extreme caution must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female patients and female partners of male patients 
when Viekirax is taken in combination with ribavirin, see section 4.6 and refer to the Summary of Product 
Characteristics for ribavirin for additional information.
Use with tacrolimus, sirolimus and everolimus
Co-administration of Viekirax and dasabuvir with systemic tacrolimus, sirolimus or everolimus increases 
the concentrations of the immunosuppressant due to CYP3A inhibition by ritonavir (see section 4.5). 
Serious and/or life threatening events have been observed with co-administration of Viekirax and 
dasabuvir with systemic tacrolimus, and a similar risk can be expected with sirolimus and everolimus.
Avoid concomitant use of tacrolimus or sirolimus with Viekirax and dasabuvir unless the benefits 
outweigh the risks. If tacrolimus or sirolimus are used together with Viekirax and dasabuvir, caution is 
advised, and recommended doses and monitoring strategies can be found in section 4.5. Everolimus 
cannot be used due to lack of suitable dose strengths for dose adjustments.
Tacrolimus or sirolimus whole blood concentrations should be monitored upon initiation and throughout 
co-administration with Viekirax and dasabuvir and the dose and/or dosing frequency should be adjusted as 
needed. Patients should be monitored frequently for any changes in renal function or tacrolimus or 
6
sirolimus associated adverse reactions. Refer to the tacrolimus or sirolimus Summary of Product 
Characteristics for additional dosing and monitoring instructions.
Genotype-specific activity
Concerning recommended regimens with different HCV genotypes, see section 4.2. Concerning 
genotype- specific virological and clinical activity, see section 5.1.
The efficacy of Viekirax has not been established in patients with HCV genotypes 2, 3, 5 and 6; therefore 
Viekirax should not be used to treat patients infected with these genotypes.
Co-administration with other direct-acting antivirals against HCV
Viekirax safety and efficacy have been established in combination with dasabuvir and/or ribavirin. Co-
administration of Viekirax with other antivirals has not been studied and, therefore, cannot be 
recommended.
Retreatment
The efficacy of Viekirax in patients previously exposed to Viekirax, or to medicinal products of the same 
classes as those of Viekirax (NS3/4A inhibitors or NS5A inhibitors), has not been demonstrated. 
Concerning cross-resistance, see also section 5.1.
Use with glucocorticoids metabolised by CYP3A (e.g. fluticasone)
Caution should be used when administering Viekirax with fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are 
metabolised by CYP3A4. Concomitant use of inhaled glucocorticoids metabolised with CYP3A can 
increase systemic exposures of the glucocorticoids, and cases of Cushing’s syndrome and subsequent 
adrenal suppression have been reported with ritonavir-containing regimens. Concomitant use of Viekirax
and glucocorticoids, particularly long-term use, should only be initiated if the potential benefit of 
treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see section 4.5).
Use with colchicine
The interaction between Viekirax with or without dasabuvir and colchicine has not been evaluated. A 
reduction in colchicine dosage or an interruption of colchicine treatment is recommended in patients with 
normal renal or hepatic function if treatment with Viekirax with or without dasabuvir is required (see 
section 4.5). In patients with renal or hepatic impairment, use of colchicine with Viekirax with or without 
dasabuvir is contraindicated (see sections 4.3 and 4.5).
Use with statins 
Simvastatin, lovastatin and atorvastatin are contraindicated (see sections 4.3 and 4.5).
Rosuvastatin
Viekirax with dasabuvir is expected to increase the exposure to rosuvastatin more than 3-fold. If 
rosuvastatin treatment is required during the treatment period, the maximum daily dose of rosuvastatin 
should be 5 mg (see section 4.5, Table 2).The increase in rosuvastatin when combined with Viekirax 
without dasabuvir is less pronounced. In this combination, the maximum daily dose of rosuvastatin should 
be 10 mg (see section 4.5, Table 2).
7
Pitavastatin and fluvastatin
The interactions between pitavastatin and fluvastatin and Viekirax have not been investigated. 
Theoretically, Viekirax with and without dasabuvir is expected to increase the exposure to pitavastatin and 
fluvastatin. A temporary suspension of pitavastatin/fluvastatin is recommended for the duration of 
treatment with Viekirax. If statin treatment is required during the treatment period, a switch to a reduced 
dose of pravastatin/rosuvastatin is possible (see section 4.5, Table 2).
Treatment of patients with HIV co-infection
Low dose ritonavir, which is part of the fixed dose combination Viekirax, may select for PI resistance in 
HIV co-infected patients without ongoing antiretroviral therapy. HIV co-infected patients without 
suppressive antiretroviral therapy should not be treated with Viekirax.
Drug interactions need to be carefully taken into account in the setting of HIV co-infection (for details see 
section 4.5, Table 2).
Atazanavir can be used in combination with Viekirax and dasabuvir, if administered at the same time. To 
be noted, atazanavir should be taken without ritonavir, since ritonavir 100 mg once daily is provided as 
part of Viekirax. The combination carries an increased risk for hyperbilirubinemia (including ocular 
icterus), in particular when ribavirin is part of the hepatitis C regimen.
Darunavir, dosed 800 mg once daily, if administered at the same time as Viekirax and dasabuvir, can be 
used in the absence of extensive PI resistance (darunavir exposure lowered). To be noted, darunavir 
should be taken without ritonavir, since ritonavir 100 mg once daily is provided as part of Viekirax.
HIV protease inhibitors other than atazanavir and darunavir (e.g., indinavir, saquinavir, tipranavir, 
lopinavir/ritonavir) are contraindicated (see section 4.3).
Raltegravir exposure is substantially increased (2-fold). The combination was not linked to any particular 
safety issues in a limited set of patients treated for 12-24 weeks.
Rilpivirine exposure is substantially increased (3-fold) when rilpivirine is given in combination with 
Viekirax and dasabuvir, with a consequent potential for QT-prolongation. If an HIV protease inhibitor is 
added (atazanavir, darunavir), rilpivirine exposure may increase even further and is, therefore, not 
recommended. Rilpivirine should be used cautiously, in the setting of repeated ECG monitoring.
NNRTIs other than rilpivirine (efavirenz, etravirine and nevirapine) are contraindicated (see section 4.3).
Hepatitis B virus reactivation
Cases of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, some of them fatal, have been reported during or after 
treatment with direct-acting antiviral medicinal products. HBV screening should be performed in all 
patients before initiation of treatment. HBV/HCV co-infected patients are at risk of HBV reactivation, and 
should, therefore, be monitored and managed according to current clinical guidelines.
Depression or psychiatric illness
Cases of depression and more rarely of suicidal ideation and suicide attempt have been reported with 
Viekirax with or without dasabuvir treatment in combination with ribavirin in the majority of the cases. 
Although some cases had previous history of depression, psychiatric illness and/or substance abuse, a 
causal relation with Viekirax with or without dasabuvir treatment cannot be excluded. Caution should be 
used in patients with a pre-existing history of depression or psychiatric illness. Patients and caregivers 
8
should be instructed to notify the prescriber of any changes in behaviour or mood and of any suicidal 
ideation.
Use in diabetic patients 
Diabetics may experience improved glucose control, potentially resulting in symptomatic hypoglycaemia, 
after initiating HCV direct acting antiviral treatment. Glucose levels of diabetic patients initiating direct 
acting antiviral therapy should be closely monitored, particularly within the first 3 months, and their 
diabetic medicinal products modified when necessary. The physician in charge of the diabetic care of the 
patient should be informed when direct acting antiviral therapy is initiated. 
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Viekirax may be administered with or without dasabuvir. When co-administered, they exert mutual effects 
on each other (see section 5.2). Therefore, the interaction profile of the compounds must be considered as 
a combination.
Pharmacodynamic interactions
Coadministration with enzyme inducers may increase the risk of adverse reactions and ALT elevations 
(see Table 2). Coadministration with ethinyloestradiol may increase the risk of ALT elevations (see 
sections 4.3 and 4.4). Examples of contraindicated enzyme inducers are provided in section 4.3.
Pharmacokinetic interactions
Potential for Viekirax to affect the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products
In vivo drug interaction studies evaluated the net effect of the combination treatment, including ritonavir.
The following section describes the specific transporters and metabolizing enzymes that are affected by 
Viekirax with or without dasabuvir. See Table 2 for guidance regarding potential interactions with other 
medicinal products and dosing recommendations.
Medicinal products metabolised by CYP3A4
Ritonavir is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A. Co-administration of Viekirax with or without dasabuvir with 
medicinal products primarily metabolized by CYP3A may result in increased plasma concentrations of 
these medicinal products. Medicinal products that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for 
which elevated plasma levels are associated with serious events are contraindicated (see section 4.3 and 
Table 2). 
CYP3A substrates evaluated in drug interaction studies which may require dose adjustment and/or clinical 
monitoring include (see Table 2) ciclosporin, sirolimus, tacrolimus, amlodipine, rilpivirine and
alprazolam. Examples of other CYP3A4 substrates which may require dose adjustment and/or clinical 
monitoring include calcium channel blockers (e.g. nifedipine), and trazodone. Although buprenorphine 
and zolpidem are also metabolized by CYP3A, drug interaction studies indicate that no dose adjustment is 
needed when co-administering these medicinal products with Viekirax with or without dasabuvir (see 
Table 2). 
Medicinal products transported by the OATP family and OCT1
Paritaprevir is an inhibitor of the hepatic uptake transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, and paritaprevir 
and ritonavir are inhibitors of OATP2B1. Ritonavir is an in vitro inhibitor of OCT1, but the clinical 
relevance is unknown. Co-administration of Viekirax with or without dasabuvir with medicinal products 
9
that are substrates of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OATP2B1 or OCT1 may increase plasma concentrations of 
these transporter substrates, potentially requiring dose adjustment/clinical monitoring. Such medicinal 
products include some statins (see Table 2), fexofenadine, repaglinide and angiotensin II receptor 
antagonists (e.g., valsartan).
OATP1B1/3 substrates evaluated in drug interaction studies include pravastatin and rosuvastatin (see 
Table 2). 
Medicinal products transported by BCRP
Paritaprevir, ritonavir and dasabuvir are inhibitors of BCRP in vivo. Co-administration of Viekirax with or 
without dasabuvir together with medicinal products that are substrates of BCRP may increase plasma 
concentrations of these transporter substrates, potentially requiring dose adjustment/clinical monitoring.  
Such medicinal products include sulfasalazine, imatinib and some of the statins (see Table 2).
BCRP substrates evaluated in drug interaction studies include rosuvastatin (see Table 2).
Medicinal products transported by P-gp in the intestine
While paritaprevir, ritonavir and dasabuvir are in vitro inhibitors of P-gp, no significant change was 
observed in the exposure of the P-gp substrate digoxin when administered with Viekirax and dasabuvir. 
However, co-administration of digoxin with Viekirax without dasabuvir may result in increased plasma 
concentrations (see Table 2). Viekirax may increase the plasma exposure to medicinal products that are 
sensitive for changed intestinal P-gp activity (such as dabigatran etexilate).
Medicinal products metabolised by glucuronidation (UGT1A1)
Paritaprevir, ombitasvir and dasabuvir are inhibitors of UGT1A1. Co-administration of Viekirax with or 
without dasabuvir with medicinal products that are primarily metabolized by UGT1A1 result in increased 
plasma concentrations of such medicinal products; routine clinical monitoring is recommended for narrow 
therapeutic index medicinal products (i.e. levothyroxine). See also Table 2 for specific advice on 
raltegravir and buprenorphine, which have been evaluated in drug interaction studies.
Medicinal products metabolised by CYP2C19
Co-administration of Viekirax with or without dasabuvir can decrease exposures of medicinal products 
that are metabolized by CYP2C19 (e.g. lansoprazole, esomeprazole, s-mephenytoin), which may require 
dose adjustment/clinical monitoring. CYP2C19 substrates evaluated in drug interaction studies include 
omeprazole and escitalopram (see Table 2).
Medicinal products metabolised by CYP2C9
Viekirax administered with or without dasabuvir did not affect the exposures of the CYP2C9 substrate, 
warfarin. Other CYP2C9 substrates (NSAIDs (e.g. ibuprofen), antidiabetics (e.g. glimepiride, glipizide) 
are not expected to require dose adjustments. 
Medicinal products metabolised by CYP2D6 or CYP1A2
Viekirax administered with or without dasabuvir did not affect the exposures of the CYP2D6/CYP1A2 
substrate, duloxetine. Exposures of cyclobenzaprine, a CYP1A2 substrate, were decreased. Clinical 
monitoring and dose adjustment may be needed for other CYP1A2 substrates (e.g. ciprofloxacin, 
cyclobenzaprine, theophylline and caffeine). CYP2D6 substrates (e.g. desipramine, metoprolol and 
dextromethorphan) are not expected to require dose adjustments. 
Medicinal products renally excreted via transport proteins
Ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir do not inhibit organic anion transporter (OAT1) in vivo as shown 
by the lack of interaction with tenofovir (OAT1 substrate). In vitro studies show that ombitasvir, 
paritaprevir, and ritonavir are not inhibitors of organic cation transporters (OCT2), organic anion 
10
transporters (OAT3), or multidrug and toxin extrusion proteins (MATE1 and MATE2K) at clinically 
relevant concentrations. 
Therefore, Viekirax with or without dasabuvir is not expected to affect medicinal products which are 
primarily excreted by the renal route via these transporters (see section 5.2). 
Potential for other medicinal products to affect the pharmacokinetics of ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and 
dasabuvir
Medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A4
Co-administration of Viekirax with or without dasabuvir with strong inhibitors of CYP3A may increase 
paritaprevir concentrations (see section 4.3 and Table 2).
Enzyme inducers
Co-administration of Viekirax and dasabuvir with medicinal products that are moderate or strong enzyme 
inducers is expected to decrease ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir and dasabuvir plasma concentrations 
and reduce their therapeutic effect. Contraindicated enzyme inducers are provided in section 4.3 and Table 
2.
Medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A4 and transport proteins
Paritaprevir is eliminated via CYP3A4 mediated metabolism and biliary excretion (substrate of the hepatic 
transporters OATP1B1, P-gp and BCRP). Caution is advised if co-administering Viekirax with medicinal 
products that are both moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 and inhibitors of multiple transporters (P-gp, BCRP 
and/or OATP1B1/ OATP1B3). These medicinal products may show clinically relevant increases in 
exposures of paritaprevir (e.g., ritonavir with atazanavir, erythromycin, diltiazem or verapamil).
Medicinal products that inhibit transport proteins
Potent inhibitors of P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1 and/or OATP1B3 have the potential to increase the exposure 
to paritaprevir. Inhibition of these transporters is not expected to show clinically relevant increases in 
exposures of ombitasvir and dasabuvir.
Patients treated with vitamin K antagonists
As liver function may change during treatment with Viekirax administered with or without dasabuvir, a 
close monitoring of International Normalised Ratio (INR) values is recommended.
Drug interaction studies
Recommendations for co-administration of Viekirax with and without dasabuvir for a number of 
medicinal products are provided in Table 2.
If a patient is already taking medicinal product(s) or initiating a medicinal product while receiving 
Viekirax with or without dasabuvir for which potential for drug interaction is expected, dose adjustment of 
the concomitant medicinal product(s) or appropriate clinical monitoring should be considered (Table 2).
If dose adjustments of concomitant medicinal products are made due to treatment with Viekirax or 
Viekirax with dasabuvir, doses should be re-adjusted after administration of Viekirax or Viekirax with
dasabuvir is completed.
Table 2 provides the Least Squares Means Ratio (90% Confidence Interval) effect on concentration of 
Viekirax with or without dasabuvir and concomitant medicinal products. 
11
The magnitude of interaction when administered with medicinal products listed in Table 2 are similar 
(≤25% difference in the Least Square Means ratio) for Viekirax with or without dasabuvir, unless 
otherwise noted. Drug interactions were evaluated for the Viekirax and dasabuvir regimen, but not for the 
Viekirax without dasabuvir, with carbamazepine, furosemide, zolpidem, darunavir twice daily, darunavir 
(evening administration), atazanavir (evening administration), rilpivirine, abacavir/lamivudine, 
dolutegravir, metformin, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, cyclobenzaprine, carisoprodol, hydrocodone/
paracetamol or diazepam. Thus, for these medicinal products, results and dosing recommendations of the 
Viekirax and dasabuvir regimen can be extrapolated to Viekirax without dasabuvir.
The direction of the arrow indicates the direction of the change in exposures (Cmax, and AUC) in 
paritaprevir, ombitasvir, dasabuvir and the co-administered medicinal product (↑ = increase (more than 
20%), ↓ = decrease (of more than 20%), ↔ = no change or change less than 20%). This is not an 
exclusive list.

300 mg once 
daily (given at 
the same 
time)
Mechanism: 
Increase in 
paritaprevir 
exposures 
may be due to 
inhibition of 
OATP1B1/B3 
and CYP3A 
by atazanavir.
The recommended dose of 
atazanavir is 300 mg, 
without ritonavir, in 
combination with Viekirax 
with dasabuvir. Atazanavir 
must be administered at 
the same time as Viekirax 
with dasabuvir. Ritonavir 
dose in Viekirax will 
provide atazanavir 
pharmacokinetic 
enhancement). 
No dose adjustment 
needed for Viekirax with 
dasabuvir.
Treatment with atazanavir 
+ Viekirax without 
dasabuvir is not 
recommended-(↑ 
paritaprevir).
The combination of 
atazanavir and Viekirax + 
dasabuvir increase 
bilirubin levels, in 
particular when ribavirin is 
part of the hepatitis C 
regimen (see sections 4.4 
and 4.8).

carbamazepine, gemfibrozil, ketoconazole, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim..
Paediatric population
Drug interaction studies have only been performed in adults.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Women of childbearing potential / contraception in males and females
Extreme caution must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female patients and female partners of male patients 
when Viekirax is taken in combination with ribavirin. Significant teratogenic and/or embryocidal effects 
have been demonstrated in all animal species exposed to ribavirin; therefore, ribavirin is contraindicated in 
women who are pregnant and in the male partners of women who are pregnant. Refer to the Summary of 
Product Characteristics for ribavirin for additional information.
Female patients: Women of childbearing potential should not receive ribavirin unless they are using an 
effective form of contraception during treatment with ribavirin and for 4 months after treatment.
Ethinyloestradiol is contraindicated in combination with Viekirax (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).
Male patients and their female partners: Either male patients or their female partners of childbearing 
potential must use a form of effective contraception during treatment with ribavirin and for 7 months after 
treatment. 
Pregnancy
There are very limited data from the use of Viekirax in pregnant women.  Studies with ombitasvir and 
paritaprevir/ritonavir in animals have shown malformations (see section 5.3). The potential risk for 
humans is unknown. Viekirax should not be used during pregnancy or in women of childbearing potential 
not using effective contraception.
37
If ribavirin is co-administered with Viekirax, the contraindications regarding use of ribavirin during 
pregnancy apply (see also the Summary of Product Characteristics of ribavirin).
Breast-feeding
It is not known whether paritaprevir /ritonavir or ombitasvir and their metabolites are excreted in human 
breast milk. Available pharmacokinetic data in animals have shown excretion of active substance and 
metabolite in milk (see section 5.3). Because of the potential for adverse reactions from the medicinal 
product in breastfed infants, a decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or discontinue 
treatment with Viekirax, taking into account the importance of the therapy to the mother. For patients co-
administered ribavirin refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of ribavirin.
Fertility
No human data on the effect of Viekirax on fertility are available. Animal studies do not indicate harmful 
effects on fertility (see section 5.3).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Viekirax has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  Patients should be 
informed that fatigue has been reported during treatment with Viekirax in combination with dasabuvir and 
ribavirin (see section 4.8).
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
In subjects receiving Viekirax and dasabuvir with ribavirin, the most commonly reported adverse 
reactions (greater than 20% of subjects) were fatigue and nausea. The proportion of subjects who 
permanently discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions was 0.2% (5/2,044) and 4.8% (99/2,044) of 
subjects had ribavirin dose reductions due to adverse reactions.
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
The safety summary is based on pooled data from phase 2 and 3 clinical trials in subjects who received 
Viekirax and dasabuvir with or without ribavirin. The majority of adverse reactions presented in Table 3 
were of grade 1 severity in Viekirax and dasabuvir-containing regimens.
The adverse reactions are listed below by system organ class and frequency. Frequencies are defined as 
follows: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare 
(≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000) or very rare (<1/10,000).

Compared to subjects without cirrhosis, in subjects with compensated cirrhosis there was an increased rate 
of indirect hyperbilirubinemia when ribavirin was part of the regimen. 
Laboratory abnormalities
Changes in selected laboratory parameters are described in Table 4. A side-by-side tabulation is shown to

Serum ALT elevations
In a pooled analysis of clinical trials with Viekirax and dasabuvir with and without ribavirin, 1% of 
subjects experienced serum ALT levels greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) after starting 
treatment. As the incidence of such elevations was 26% among women taking a concomitant 
ethinyloestradiol-containing medicinal product, such medicinal products are contraindicated with Viekirax 
with or without dasabuvir. No increase in incidence of ALT elevations was observed with other types of 
estrogens commonly used for hormone replacement therapy (e.g. oestradiol and conjugated estrogens). 
ALT elevations were typically asymptomatic, generally occurred during the first 4 weeks of treatment 
(mean time 20 days, range 8-57 days) and most resolved with ongoing therapy. Two patients discontinued 
Viekirax and dasabuvir due to elevated ALT, including one on ethinyloestradiol. Three interrupted 
Viekirax and dasabuvir for one to seven days, including one on ethinyloestradiol. The majority of these 
ALT elevations were transient and assessed as drug-related. Elevations in ALT were generally not 
associated with bilirubin elevations. Cirrhosis was not a risk factor for elevated ALT (see section 4.4).
Serum bilirubin elevations
Transient elevations in serum bilirubin (predominantly indirect) were observed in subjects receiving 
Viekirax and dasabuvir with ribavirin, related to the inhibition of the bilirubin transporters OATP1B1/1B3 
by paritaprevir and ribavirin-induced haemolysis. Bilirubin elevations occurred after initiation of 
treatment, peaked by study Week 1, and generally resolved with ongoing therapy. Bilirubin elevations 
were not associated with aminotransferase elevations. The frequency of indirect bilirubin elevations was 
lower among subjects who did not receive ribavirin.
Liver transplant recipients
The overall safety profile in HCV-infected transplant recipients who were administered Viekirax and 
dasabuvir and ribavirin (in addition to their immunosuppressant medications) was similar to subjects 
40
treated with Viekirax and dasabuvir and ribavirin in phase 3 clinical trials, although some adverse 
reactions were increased in frequency. 10 subjects (29.4%) had at least one post baseline haemoglobin 
value of less than 10 g/dL. 10 of 34 subjects (29.4%) dose modified ribavirin due to decrease in 
haemoglobin and 2.9% (1/34) had an interruption of ribavirin. Ribavirin dose modification did not impact 
SVR rates. 5 subjects required erythropoietin, all of whom initiated ribavirin at the starting dose of 1000 to 
1200 mg daily. No subject received a blood transfusion.
HIV/HCV co-infected patients
The overall safety profile in HCV/HIV-1 co-infected subjects was similar to that observed in HCV mono-
infected subjects. Transient elevations in total bilirubin >3 x ULN (mostly indirect) occurred in 17 
(27.0%) subjects; 15 of these subjects were receiving atazanavir. None of the subjects with 
hyperbilirubinemia had concomitant elevations of aminotransferases.
GT1-infected subjects with or without cirrhosis with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease 
(ESRD)
Viekirax and dasabuvir with or without ribavirin were assessed in 68 subjects with genotype 1 infection 
with or without cirrhosis who have severe renal impairment or ESRD (see Section 5.1). The overall safety 
profile in subjects with severe renal impairment was similar to that seen in prior Phase 3 studies in 
subjects without severe renal impairment, except that a greater proportion of subjects required intervention 
due to ribavirin-associated decreases in serum haemoglobin. The mean baseline haemoglobin level was 
12.1 g/dL and the mean decline in haemoglobin at the end of treatment for subjects taking RBV was 1.2 
g/dL.  Thirty-nine of the 50 subjects who received ribavirin required interruption of ribavirin, and 11 of 
these subjects were also treated with erythropoietin. Four subjects experienced a haemoglobin level < 8 
g/dL.  Two subjects received a blood transfusion.  Adverse events of anaemia were not seen in the 18 
GT1b-infected subjects who did not receive ribavirin. Viekirax with or without dasabuvir was also 
evaluated without ribavirin in 18 GT1a- and GT4-infected patients; no adverse events of anaemia were 
seen in these subjects.
Paediatric population
The safety of Viekirax in children and adolescents aged < 18 years has not yet been established. No data 
are available.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are 
asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
The highest documented single dose administered to healthy volunteers was 400 mg for paritaprevir (with 
100 mg ritonavir), 200 mg for ritonavir (with 100 mg paritaprevir) and 350 mg for ombitasvir. No study 
related adverse reactions with paritaprevir, ritonavir, or ombitasvir were observed. Transient increases in 
indirect bilirubin were observed at the highest doses of paritaprevir/ritonavir. In case of overdose, it is 
recommended that the patient be monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions or effects and 
appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted immediately.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use; direct-acting antivirals, ATC code: J05AP53
Mechanism of action
Viekirax, when co-administered with dasabuvir, combines three direct-acting antiviral medicinal products
with distinct mechanisms of action and non-overlapping resistance profiles to target HCV at multiple steps 
in the viral lifecycle. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of dasabuvir for its 
pharmacological properties.
Ritonavir
Ritonavir is not active against HCV. Ritonavir is a CYP3A inhibitor that increases the systemic exposure 
of the CYP3A substrate paritaprevir. 
Ombitasvir
Ombitasvir is an inhibitor of HCV NS5A which is essential for viral replication. 
Paritaprevir
Paritaprevir is an inhibitor of HCV NS3/4A protease which is necessary for the proteolytic cleavage of the 
HCV encoded polyprotein (into mature forms of the NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B proteins) and 
is essential for viral replication.
Activity in cell culture and/or biochemical studies
Ombitasvir
The EC50 of ombitasvir against genotype 1a-H77 and 1b-Con1 strains in HCV replicon cell culture assays 
was 14.1 and 5 pM, respectively. The activity of ombitasvir was attenuated 11- to 13-fold in the presence 
of 40% human plasma. The mean EC50 of ombitasvir against replicons containing NS5A from a panel of 
treatment-naïve genotype 1a and 1b isolates in the HCV replicon cell culture assay was 0.66 pM (range 
0.35 to 0.88 pM; n=11) and 1.0 pM (range 0.74 to 1.5 pM; n=11), respectively. Ombitasvir has EC50
values of 12, 4.3, 19, 1.7, 3.2, and 366 pM against replicon cell lines constructed with NS5A from single 
isolates representing genotypes 2a, 2b, 3a, 4a, 5a, and 6a, respectively.
Paritaprevir
The EC50 of paritaprevir against genotype 1a-H77 and 1b-Con1 strains in the HCV replicon cell culture 
assay was 1.0 and 0.21 nM, respectively. The activity of paritaprevir was attenuated 24 to 27 -fold in the 
presence of 40% human plasma. The mean EC50 of paritaprevir against replicons containing NS3 from a 
panel of treatment-naïve genotype 1a and 1b isolates in the HCV replicon cell culture assay was 0.86 nM 
(range 0.43 to 1.87 nM; n=11) and 0.06 nM (range 0.03 to 0.09 nM; n=9), respectively. Paritaprevir had 
an EC50 value of 5.3 nM against the 2a-JFH-1 replicon cell line, and EC50 values of 19, 0.09, and 0.68 nM 
against replicon cell lines containing NS3 from a single isolate each of genotype 3a, 4a, and 6a, 
respectively
Ritonavir did not exhibit a direct antiviral effect on the replication of HCV subgenomic replicons, and the 
presence of ritonavir did not affect the in vitro antiviral activity of paritaprevir.
42
Resistance
In cell culture
Genotype 1
Resistance to paritaprevir and ombitasvir conferred by variants in NS3 and NS5A respectively, selected in 
cell culture or identified in Phase 2b and 3 clinical trials were phenotypically characterised in the 
appropriate genotype 1a or 1b replicons.
In genotype 1a, substitutions F43L, R155K, A156T, and D168A/F/H/V/Y in HCV NS3 reduced 
susceptibility to paritaprevir. In the genotype 1a replicon, the activity of paritaprevir was reduced 20-, 37-, 
and 17-fold by the F43L, R155K and A156T substitutions, respectively. The activity of paritaprevir was 
reduced 96-fold by D168V, and 50- to 219-fold by each of the other D168 substitutions. The activity of 
paritaprevir in genotype 1a was not significantly affected (less than or equal to 3-fold) by single 
substitutions V36A/M, V55I, Y56H, Q80K or E357K. Double variants including combinations of 
V36LM, F43L, Y56H, Q80K or E357K with R155K or with a D168 substitution reduced the activity of 
paritaprevir by an additional 2 to 3-fold relative to the single R155K or D168 substitution. In the genotype 
1b replicon, the activity of paritaprevir was reduced 76- and 159-and 337- fold by D168A, D168H, 
D168V, and D168Y respectively. Y56H alone could not be evaluated due to poor replication capacity, 
however, the combination of Y56H and D168A/V/Y reduced the activity of paritaprevir by 700- to 4118-
fold.
In genotype 1a, substitutions M28T/V, Q30E/R, L31V, H58D, Y93C/H/N, and M28V + Q30R in HCV 
NS5A reduced susceptibility to ombitasvir. In the genotype 1a replicon, the activity of ombitasvir was 
reduced by 896-, 58- and 243-fold against the M28T/V and H58D substitutions, respectively, and 1326-, 
800-, 155-foldand 1675- to 66740- fold by the Q30E/R, L31V and Y93C/H/N substitutions, respectively. 
Y93H, Y93N or M28V in combination with Q30R reduced the activity of ombitasvir by more than 
42,802-fold. In genotype 1b, substitutions L28T, L31F/V, as well as Y93H alone or in combination with 
L28M, R30Q, L31F/M/V or P58S in HCV NS5A reduced susceptibility to ombitasvir. In the genotype 1b 
replicon, the activity of ombitasvir was reduced by less than 10-fold by variants at amino acid positions 30 
and 31. The activity of ombitasvir was reduced by 661-, 77-, 284- and 142-fold against the genotype 1b 
substitutions L28T, Y93H, R30Q in combination with Y93H, and L31M in combination with Y93H, 
respectively. All other double substitutions of Y93H in combination with substitutions at positions 28, 31, 
or 58 reduced the activity of ombitasvir by more than 400-fold.
Genotype 4
In genotype 4a, resistance to paritaprevir or ombitasvir by variants in NS3 or NS5A, respectively, selected 
in cell culture were phenotypically characterised. Substitutions R155C, A156T/V, and D168H/V in HCV 
NS3 reduced susceptibility to paritaprevir by 40- to 323-fold. Substitution L28V in HCV NS5A reduced 
the susceptibility to ombitasvir by 21-fold.
Effect of baseline HCV substitutions/polymorphisms on treatment outcome
A pooled analysis of subjects with genotype 1 HCV infection, who were treated with ombitasvir, 
paritaprevir, and dasabuvir (a non-nucleotide NS5B inhibitor) with or without ribavirin in the Phase 2b 
and 3 clinical trials was conducted to explore the association between baseline NS3/4A, NS5A or NS5B 
substitutions/polymorphisms and treatment outcome in recommended regimens.
In the greater than 500 genotype 1a baseline samples in this analysis, the most frequently observed 
resistance-associated variants were M28V (7.4%) in NS5A and S556G (2.9%) in NS5B. Q80K, although a 
highly prevalent polymorphism in NS3 (41.2% of samples), confers minimal resistance to paritaprevir. 
43
Resistance-associated variants at amino acid positions R155 and D168 in NS3 were rarely observed (less 
than 1%) at baseline. In the greater than 200 genotype 1b baseline samples in this analysis, the most 
frequently observed resistance-associated variants observed were Y93H (7.5%) in NS5A, and C316N 
(17.0%) and S556G (15%) in NS5B. Given the low virologic failure rates observed with recommended 
treatment regimens for HCV genotype 1a- and 1b-infected subjects, the presence of baseline variants 
appears to have little impact on the likelihood of achieving SVR.
In clinical studies
Of the 2,510 HCV genotype 1 infected subjects who were treated with regimens containing ombitasvir, 
paritaprevir, and dasabuvir with or without ribavirin (for 8, 12, or 24 weeks) in Phase 2b and 3 clinical 
trials, a total of 74 subjects (3%) experienced virologic failure (primarily post-treatment relapse). 
Treatment-emergent variants and their prevalence in these virologic failure populations are shown in 
Table 5. In the 67 genotype 1a infected subjects, NS3 variants were observed in 50 subjects, NS5A 
variants were observed in 46 subjects, NS5B variants were observed in 37 subjects, and treatment-
emergent variants were seen in all 3 drug targets in 30 subjects. In the 7 genotype 1b infected subjects, 
treatment-emergent variants were observed in NS3 in 4 subjects, in NS5A in 2 subjects, and in both NS3 
and NS5A in 1 subject. No genotype 1b infected subjects had treatment-emergent variants in all 3 drug 
targets.

a. Observed in at least 2 subjects of the same subtype.
b. N=66 for the NS5B target.
c. Substitutions were observed in combination with other emergent substitutions at NS3 position 
R155 or D168.
d. Observed in combination in genotype 1b-infected subjects.
e. Observed in combination in 6% (4/67) of the subjects.
Note: The following variants were selected in cell culture but were not treatment-emergent: NS3 
variants A156T in genotype 1a, and R155Q and D168H in genotype 1b; NS5A variants Y93C/H in 
44
genotype 1a, and L31F/V or Y93H in combination with L28M, L31F/V or P58S in genotype 1b; and 
NS5B variants Y448H in genotype 1a, and M414T and Y448H in genotype 1b.
Persistence of resistance-associated substitutions
The persistence of paritaprevir, ombitasvir, and dasabuvir resistance-associated amino acid substitutions in 
NS3, NS5A, and NS5B, respectively, was assessed in genotype 1a-infected subjects in Phase 2b trials. 
Paritaprevir treatment-emergent variants V36A/M, R155K or D168V were observed in NS3 in 47 
subjects. Ombitasvir treatment-emergent variants M28T, M28V or Q30R in NS5A were observed in 32 
subjects. Dasabuvir treatment-emergent variants M414T, G554S, S556G, G558R or D559G/N in NS5B 
were observed in 34 subjects.
NS3 variants V36A/M and R155K and NS5B variants M414T and S556G remained detectable at post-
treatment Week 48, whereas NS3 variant D168V and all other NS5B variants were not observed at post-
treatment Week 48. All treatment-emergent variants in NS5A remained detectable at post-treatment Week 
48. Due to high SVR rates in genotype 1b, trends in persistence of treatment-emergent variants in this 
genotype could not be established.
The lack of detection of virus containing a resistance-associated substitution does not indicate that the 
resistant virus is no longer present at clinically significant levels. The long-term clinical impact of the 
emergence or persistence of virus containing Viekirax- and dasabuvir-resistance-associated substitutions
on future treatment is unknown.
Cross-resistance
Cross-resistance is expected among NS5A inhibitors, NS3/4A protease inhibitors, and non-nucleoside 
NS5B inhibitors by class. The impact of prior ombitasvir, paritaprevir or dasabuvir treatment experience 
on the efficacy of other NS5A inhibitors, NS3/4A protease inhibitors, or NS5B inhibitors has not been 
studied.
Clinical efficacy and safety
Clinical studies in subjects with genotype 1 hepatitis C infection
The efficacy and safety of Viekirax in combination with dasabuvir with and without ribavirin was 
evaluated in eight Phase 3 clinical trials, including two trials exclusively in subjects with cirrhosis (Child-
Pugh A), in over 2,360 subjects with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C infection as summarised in Table 6.

In all eight trials, the Viekirax dose was 25 mg/150 mg/100 mg once daily and the dasabuvir dose was 
250 mg twice daily. For subjects who received ribavirin, the ribavirin dose was 1000 mg per day for 
subjects weighing less than 75 kg or 1200 mg per day for subjects weighing greater than or equal to 75 kg.
Sustained virologic response (SVR) was the primary endpoint to determine the HCV cure rate in the Phase 
3 studies and was defined as unquantifiable or undetectable HCV RNA 12 weeks after the end of 
treatment (SVR12). Treatment duration was fixed in each trial and was not guided by subjects’ HCV RNA 
levels (no response guided algorithm). Plasma HCV RNA values were measured during the clinical trials 
using the COBAS TaqMan HCV test (version 2.0), for use with the High Pure System (except GARNET 
which used COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HCV Test v2.0). The High Pure system assay had a 
lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 25 IU per mL and the AmpliPrep assay had a LLOQ of 15 IU per 
mL.

Durability of response
Overall, 660 subjects in Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials had HCV RNA results for both the SVR12 and 
SVR24 time points. Among these subjects, the positive predictive value of SVR12 on SVR24 was 99.8%.
Pooled efficacy analysis
In Phase 3 clinical trials, 1075 subjects (including 181 with compensated cirrhosis) with genotype 1 HCV 
infection received the recommended regimen (see section 4.2). Table 16 shows SVR rates for these 
subjects.
In subjects who received the recommended regimen, 97% achieved SVR overall (among which 181
subjects with compensated cirrhosis achieved 97% SVR), while 0.5% experienced virologic breakthrough 
and 1.2% experienced post-treatment relapse.

Viekirax without ribavirin and without dasabuvir was also evaluated in genotype 1b infected subjects in 
Phase 2 studies M13-393 (PEARL-I) and M12-536. PEARL I was conducted in the US and Europe, M12-
536 in Japan. The treatment-experienced subjects studied were primarily pegIFN/RBV null responders. 
The doses of ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir were 25 mg 150 mg, 100 mg once daily in PEARL-I, while 
the dose of paritaprevir was 100 mg or 150 mg in study M12-536. Treatment duration was 12 weeks for 
treatment naïve subjects, 12-24 weeks for treatment experienced subjects and 24 weeks for subjects with 
cirrhosis. Overall, 107 of 113 subjects without cirrhosis and 147 of 155 subjects with cirrhosis achieved 
SVR12 after 12-24 weeks of treatment.
Viekirax with ribavirin & without dasabuvir was evaluated for 12 weeks in genotype 1 treatment naive 
and treatment experienced non-cirrhotic subjects in a phase 2 study M11-652 (AVIATOR). The doses of 
paritaprevir were 100 mg and 200 mg and ombitasvir 25 mg. Ribavirin was dosed based on weight (1000 
mg – 1200 mg per day). Overall, 72 of 79 treatment-naive subjects (45 of 52 GT1a and 27 of 27 GT1b) 
and 40 of 45 treatment-experienced subjects (21 of 26 GT1a and 19 of 19 GT1b) achieved SVR12 after 12 
weeks of treatment. 
Impact of ribavirin dose adjustment on probability of SVR
In Phase 3 clinical trials, 91.5% of subjects did not require ribavirin dose adjustments during therapy. In 
the 8.5% of subjects who had ribavirin dose adjustments during therapy, the SVR rate (98.5%) was 
comparable to subjects who maintained their starting ribavirin dose throughout treatment.

Treatment: 
for 12 or 24 weeks
randomised, global multicentre, open-label
Viekirax with or without dasabuvir coadminstered with or without weight-based ribavirin 
See section 4.2 for dosing recommendations in HCV/HIV-1 co-infected patients. HCV GT1- or 4-infected 
subjects with HIV-1 coinfection were on a stable HIV-1 antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen that 
included ritonavir-boosted atazanavir, raltegravir, dolutegravir (Part 2 only), or darunavir (Part 1b and Part 
2 GT4 only)-, co-administered with a backbone of tenofovir plus emtricitabine or lamivudine.
Part 1 of the study was a Phase 2 pilot cohort consisting of 2 parts, Part 1a (63 subjects) and Part 1b (22 
subjects). Part 2 was a Phase 3 cohort consisting of 233 subjects.  
In Part 1a, all subjects received Viekirax and dasabuvir with ribavirin for 12 or 24 weeks.  
Treated subjects (N = 63) had a median age of 51 years (range: 31 to 69); 24% were Black; 19% had 
compensated cirrhosis; 67% were treatment-naïve; 33% had failed prior treatment with pegIFN/RBV; 
89% had HCV genotype 1a infection. 
In Part 1b, all subjects received Viekirax and dasabuvir with ribavirin for 12 weeks.  Treated subjects (N = 
22) had a median age of 54 years (range: 34 to 68); 41% were Black; 14% had compensated cirrhosis; 
86% were HCV treatment-naïve; 14% had failed prior treatment with pegIFN/RBV; 68% had HCV 
genotype 1a infection.
In Part 2, subjects with HCV GT1 received Viekirax and dasabuvir with or without ribavirin for 12 or 24 
weeks.  Subjects with HCV GT4 received Viekirax with ribavirin for 12 or 24 Weeks.  Treated subjects 
(N = 233) had a median age of 49 years (range: 26 to 69); 10% were Black; 12% had compensated 
cirrhosis; 66% were treatment-naïve; 32% had failed prior treatment with pegIFN/RBV; 2% had failed 
prior treatment with sofosbuvir.

Efficacy analyses performed on other parts of the study demonstrated similarly high SVR12 rates. In Part 
1a, SVR12 was achieved by 29/31 (93.5%) subjects on the 12-week arm (95% CI: 79.3%, 98.2%) and by 
29/32 (90.6%) subjects on the 24-week arm (95% CI: 75.8% – 96.8%). There was 1 relapse in the 12-
week arm and 1 on-treatment virologic failure in the 24-week arm. In Part 1b, SVR12 was achieved by 
22/22 (100%) subjects (95% CI: 85.1%, 100%). In Part 2, SVR12 was achieved by 27/28 (96.4%) subjects 
with HCV GT4/HIV-1 coinfection (95% CI: 82.3%, 99.4%) with no virologic failures.
The SVR12 rates in HCV/HIV-1 co-infected subjects were thus consistent with SVR12 rates in the phase 
3 trials of HCV mono-infected subjects.

randomised, global multicentre, open-label
Viekirax and dasabuvir for 12 or 24 weeks with or without ribavirin ( investigator chosen 
In subjects with liver transplant, no cirrhosis and GT1 infection, patients were dosed with Viekirax and 
dasabuvir for 12-24 weeks, with and without RBV. Liver transplant subjects with cirrhosis were dosed 
with Viekirax and dasabuvir with RBV (GT1a for 24 weeks [n=4], GT1b for 12 weeks [n=2]). Subjects 
with renal transplant and no cirrhosis were dosed for 12 weeks (with RBV for GT1a [n=9], without RBV 
for GT1b [n=3]). Subjects with liver transplant and GT4 infection were dosed with Viekirax with RBV 
(non-cirrhotic for 12 weeks [n=2] and cirrhotic for 24 weeks [n=1]. The dose of ribavirin was left to the 
discretion of the investigator, with most subjects receiving 600 to 800 mg per day as a starting dose, and 
most subjects also receiving 600 to 800 mg per day at the end of treatment.
A total of 129 subjects were treated, 84 with GT1a, 41 with GT1b, 1 with GT1 other, 3 with GT4 
infection. Overall, 61% had fibrosis stage F0-F1, 26% F2, 9% F3, and 4% F4.  61% had prior HCV 
treatment experience before transplant. For immunosuppressive medication, most subjects were taking 
tacrolimus (81%), with the remainder taking cyclosporine.
Among all GT1 subjects who were post liver transplant, 111/114 (97.4%) achieved SVR12; with 2 
relapsing post treatment and 1 breakthrough on treatment.  Among the GT1 subjects who were post renal 
transplant, 9/12 (75%) achieved SVR12; however, there were no virologic failures. All 3 (100%) subjects 
with GT4 infection who were post liver transplant achieved SVR12.
Clinical trial in patients receiving opioid substitution therapy
In a phase 2, multicentre, open-label, single arm study, 38 treatment-naïve or pegIFN/RBV treatment 
experienced, non-cirrhotic subjects with genotype 1 infection who were on stable doses of methadone 
(N=19) or buprenorphine +/- naloxone (N=19) received 12 weeks of Viekirax and dasabuvir with 
ribavirin. Treated subjects had a median age of 51 years (range: 26 to 64); 65.8% were male and 5.3% 
were Black. A majority (86.8%) had baseline HCV RNA levels of at least 800,000 IU/mL and a majority 
(84.2%) had genotype 1a infection; 15.8% had portal fibrosis (F2) and 5.3% had bridging fibrosis (F3); 
and 94.7% were naïve to prior HCV treatment. 
Overall, 37 (97.4%) of 38 subjects achieved SVR12. No subjects experienced on-treatment virologic 
failure or relapse.

Severe renal impairment or ESRD includes CKD Stage 4 defined as eGFR <30-15 mL/min/1.73 m2 or 
CKD Stage 5 defined as <15 mL/min/1.73 m2 or requiring haemodialysis. Treated subjects (N=68) had a 
median age of 58 years (range: 32-77 years); 83.8% were male; 58.8% were Black; 73.5% of subjects 
were infected with HCV GT1a; 75.0%% had Stage 5 CKD and 69.1% were on haemodialysis. 
Sixty four of 68 (94.1%) subjects achieved SVR12. One subject experienced relapse at Post-Treatment 
Week 4, 2 subjects prematurely discontinued study drug and 1 subject had missing SVR12 data.
See also Section 4.8 for discussion of safety information for RUBY-I.
In another open-label phase 3b study evaluating 12 weeks of Viekirax with or without dasabuvir and 
without RBV in non-cirrhotic, treatment-naive GT1a and GT4 patients with CKD stage 4 or 5 (Ruby II), 
the SVR12 rate was 94.4% (17/18), with no subjects experiencing on-treatment virologic failure or 
relapse.

Pharmacokinetic properties
The pharmacokinetic properties of the combination of Viekirax with dasabuvir have been evaluated in 
healthy adult subjects and in subjects with chronic hepatitis C. Table 20 shows mean Cmax and AUC of 
Viekirax 25 mg/150 mg/100 mg once daily with dasabuvir 250 mg twice daily following multiple doses 
with food in healthy volunteers.

Ombitasvir
Paritaprevir
Ritonavir
Absorption
Ombitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir were absorbed after oral administration with mean Tmax of 
approximately 4 to 5 hours. While ombitasvir exposures increased in a dose proportional manner, 
paritaprevir and ritonavir exposures increased in a more than dose proportional manner. Accumulation is 
57
minimal for ombitasvir and approximately 1.5- to 2-fold for ritonavir and paritaprevir. Pharmacokinetic 
steady state for the combination is achieved after approximately 12 days of dosing.
The absolute bioavailability of ombitasvir and paritaprevir was approximately 50% when administered
with food as Viekirax.
Effect of paritaprevir/ritonavir on ombitasvir and dasabuvir 
In the presence of paritaprevir/ritonavir, dasabuvir exposures decreased by approximately 50% to 60% 
while ombitasvir exposures increased by 31-47%.
Effect of ombitasvir on paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir
In the presence of ombitasvir, paritaprevir exposures were minimally affected (5% to 27% change) while 
dasabuvir exposures increase by approximately 30%.
Effect of dasabuvir on paritaprevir/ritonavir and ombitasvir
In the presence of dasabuvir, paritaprevir exposures increased by 50% to 65% while there was no change 
in ombitasvir exposures.
Effects of food
Ombitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir should be administered with food. All clinical trials with ombitasvir, 
paritaprevir and ritonavir have been conducted following administration with food.
Food increased the exposure (AUC) of ombitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir by up to 82%, 211% and 
49%, respectively relative to the fasting state. The increase in exposure was similar regardless of meal 
type (e.g., high-fat versus moderate-fat) or calorie content (approximately 600 Kcal versus approximately 
1000 Kcal). To maximise absorption, Viekirax should be taken with food without regard to fat or calorie 
content.
Distribution
Ombitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir are highly bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is not 
meaningfully altered in subjects with renal or hepatic impairment. The blood to plasma concentration 
ratios in humans ranged from 0.6 to 0.8 indicating that ombitasvir and paritaprevir were preferentially 
distributed in the plasma compartment of whole blood. Ombitasvir was approximately 99.9% bound to 
human plasma proteins. Paritaprevir was approximately 97-98.6% bound to human plasma proteins. 
Ritonavir was greater than 99% bound to human plasma proteins.
In vitro data indicate that paritaprevir is a substrate for the human hepatic uptake transporters, OATP1B1 
and OATP1B3.
Biotransformation
Ombitasvir
Ombitasvir is metabolised via amide hydrolysis followed by oxidative metabolism. Following a 25 mg 
single dose of 14C-ombitasvir given alone, unchanged parent drug accounted for 8.9% of total radioactivity 
in human plasma; a total of 13 metabolites were identified in human plasma. These metabolites are not 
expected to have antiviral activity or off-target pharmacologic activity.
58
Paritaprevir
Paritaprevir is metabolised predominantly by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent CYP3A5. Following 
administration of a single 200 mg/100 mg oral dose of 14C paritaprevir /ritonavir to humans, the parent 
drug was the major circulating component, accounting for approximately 90% of the plasma radioactivity. 
At least 5 minor metabolites of paritaprevir have been identified in circulation that accounted for 
approximately 10% of plasma radioactivity. These metabolites are not expected to have antiviral activity.
Ritonavir
Ritonavir is predominantly metabolised by CYP3A and to a lesser extent, by CYP2D6. Nearly the entire 
plasma radioactivity after a single 600 mg dose of 14C-ritonavir oral solution in humans was attributed to 
unchanged ritonavir.
Elimination
Ombitasvir
Following dosing of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with or without dasabuvir, mean plasma half-life of 
ombitasvir was approximately 21 to 25 hours. Following a single 25 mg dose of 14C- ombitasvir
approximately 90% of the radioactivity was recovered in faeces and 2% in urine. Unchanged parent drug 
accounted for 88% of total radioactivity recovered in faeces, indicating that biliary excretion is a major 
elimination pathway for ombitasvir. 
Paritaprevir
Following dosing of ombitasvir/paritaprevir /ritonavir with or without dasabuvir, mean plasma half-life of 
paritaprevir was approximately 5.5 hours. Following a 200 mg 14C -paritaprevir dose with 100 mg 
ritonavir, approximately 88% of the radioactivity was recovered in faeces with limited radioactivity 
(8.8%) in urine. Metabolism as well as biliary excretion of parent drug contribute to the elimination of 
paritaprevir.
Ritonavir
Following dosing of ombitasvir/paritaprevir /ritonavir, mean plasma half-life of ritonavir was 
approximately 4 hours. Following a 600 mg dose of 14C -ritonavir oral solution, 86.4% of the radioactivity 
was recovered in the faeces and 11.3% of the dose was excreted in the urine.
In vitro interaction data
Ombitasvir and paritaprevir do not inhibit organic anion transporter (OAT1) in vivo and are not expected 
to inhibit organic cation transporters (OCT1 and OCT2), organic anion transporters (OAT3), or multidrug 
and toxin extrusion proteins (MATE1 and MATE2K) at clinically relevant concentrations. Ritonavir does 
not inhibit OAT1 and is not expected to inhibit OCT2, OAT3, MATE1 and MATE2K at clinically 
relevant concentrations.
Special populations
Elderly
59
Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis of data from Phase 3 clinical studies, a 10 year increase or 
decrease in age from 54 years (median age in the Phase 3 studies) would result in approximately 10% 
change in ombitasvir exposures, and ≤20% change in paritaprevir exposures. There is no pharmacokinetic 
information in patients >75 years.
Sex or body weight
Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis of data from Phase 3 clinical studies, female subjects 
would have approximately 55% higher, 100% higher and 15% higher ombitasvir, paritaprevir and 
ritonavir exposures than male subjects. However, no dose-adjustment based on gender is warranted. A 
10 kg change in body weight from 76 kg (median weight in the Phase 3 studies) would results in <10% 
change in ombitasvir exposures, and no change in paritaprevir exposures. Body weight is not a significant 
predictor of ritonavir exposures.
Race or ethnicity
Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis of data from Phase 3 clinical studies, Asian subjects had 
18% to 21% higher ombitasvir exposures, and 37% to 39% higher paritaprevir exposures than non-Asian 
subjects. The ritonavir exposures were comparable between Asians and non-Asians.
Renal impairment
The changes in ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir exposures in subjects with mild, moderate and 
severe renal impairment are not considered to be clinically significant. Limited data in patients with end-
stage renal disease indicate no clinically significant changes in exposure also in this patient group. No 
dose adjustment of Viekirax with and without dasabuvir is required for patients with mild, moderate or 
severe renal impairment , or end-stage-renal disease on dialysis (see section 4.2). 
Pharmacokinetics of the combination of ombitasvir 25 mg, paritaprevir 150 mg, and ritonavir 100 mg, 
with or without dasabuvir 400 mg were evaluated in subjects with mild (CrCl: 60 to 89 ml/min), moderate 
(CrCl: 30 to 59 ml/min) and severe (CrCl: 15 to 29 ml/min) renal impairment.
Following administration of Viekirax and dasabuvir
Compared to the subjects with normal renal function, ombitasvir exposures were comparable in subjects 
with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment. Compared to the subjects with normal renal function, 
paritaprevir Cmax values were comparable, but AUC values were 19%, 33% and 45% higher in mild, 
moderate and severe renal impairment, respectively. Ritonavir plasma concentrations increased when 
renal function was reduced: Cmax and AUC values were 26% to 42% higher, 48% to 80% higher and 66% 
to 114% higher in subjects with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, respectively.
Following administration of Viekirax
Following administration of Viekirax, the changes in ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir exposures in 
subjects with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment were similar to those observed when Viekirax
was administered with dasabuvir, and are not considered to be clinically significant. 
Hepatic impairment
60
Following administration of Viekirax and dasabuvir
Pharmacokinetics of the combination of ombitasvir 25 mg, paritaprevir 200 mg, and ritonavir 100 mg, 
with dasabuvir 400 mg were evaluated in non-HCV infected subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A), moderate 
(Child-Pugh B) and severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment.
In subjects with mild hepatic impairment, paritaprevir, ritonavir and ombitasvir mean Cmax and AUC 
values decreased by 29% to 48%, 34% to 38% and up to 8%, respectively, compared to subjects with 
normal hepatic function.
In subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, ombitasvir and ritonavir mean Cmax and AUC values 
decreased by 29% to 30% and 30 to 33%, respectively, while paritaprevir mean Cmax and AUC values
increased by 26% to 62% compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. (see sections 4.2, 4.4, and 
4.8).
In subjects with severe hepatic impairment, paritaprevir mean Cmax and AUC values increased by 3.2-to 
9.5-fold; ritonavir mean Cmax values were 35% lower and AUC values were 13% higher and ombitasvir
mean Cmax and AUC values decreased by 68% and 54%, respectively, compared to subjects with normal 
hepatic function, therefore, Viekirax must not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see 
sections 4.2 and 4.4).
In HCV-infected subjects, in comparison to those without cirrhosis, paritaprevir AUC increased to 2.2- to 
2.4-fold for those with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A) and 3- to 4-fold for those with Child-Pugh B 
cirrhosis.
Following administration of Viekirax
Pharmacokinetics of the combination of ombitasvir 25 mg, paritaprevir 200 mg, and ritonavir 100 mg 
were not evaluated in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A), moderate (Child-Pugh B) and severe (Child-
Pugh C) hepatic impairment. Results from the pharmacokinetic evaluation of the combination of 
ombitasvir 25 mg, paritaprevir 200 mg, and ritonavir 100 mg, with dasabuvir 400 mg can be extrapolated 
to the combination of ombitasvir 25 mg, paritaprevir 200 mg, and ritonavir 100 mg.
Paediatric population
The pharmacokinetics of Viekirax in paediatric patients has not been established (see section 4.2).
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Ombitasvir
Ombitasvir and its major inactive human metabolites (M29, M36) were not genotoxic in a battery of in 
vitro or in vivo assays, including bacterial mutagenicity, chromosome aberration using human peripheral 
blood lymphocytes and in vivo mouse micronucleus assays.
Ombitasvir was not carcinogenic in a 6-month transgenic mouse study up to the highest dosage tested 
(150 mg/kg/day), resulting in ombitasvir AUC exposures approximately 26-fold higher than those in 
humans at the recommended clinical dose of 25 mg.
Similarly, ombitasvir was not carcinogenic in a 2-year rat study up to the highest dose tested (30 mg per 
kg per day), resulting in ombitasvir exposures approximately 16-fold higher than those in humans at 25 
mg.
61
Ombitasvir has shown malformations in rabbits at maximal feasible exposures 4-fold higher than the AUC 
exposure at recommended clinical dose. Malformations at low incidence were observed mainly in the eyes 
(microphthalmia) and teeth (absent incisors). In mice, an increased incidence of open eye lid was present 
in foetuses of dams administered ombitasvir; however, the relationship to treatment with ombitasvir is 
uncertain. The major, inactive human metabolites of ombitasvir were not teratogenic in mice at exposures 
approximately 26 times higher than in humans at the recommended clinical dose. Ombitasvir had no effect 
on fertility when evaluated in mice.
Unchanged ombitasvir was the predominant component observed in the milk of lactating rats, without 
effect on nursing pups. Ombitasvir-derived material was minimally transferred through the placenta in 
pregnant rats.
Paritaprevir/ritonavir
Paritaprevir was positive in an in vitro human chromosome aberration test. Paritaprevir was negative in a 
bacterial mutation assay, and in two in vivo genetic toxicology assays (rat bone marrow micronucleus and 
rat liver Comet tests).
Paritaprevir /ritonavir was not carcinogenic in a 6-month transgenic mouse study up to the highest dosage 
tested (300 mg/30 mg/kg/day), resulting in paritaprevir AUC exposures approximately 38-fold higher than 
those in humans at the recommended dose of 150 mg. Similarly, paritaprevir/ritonavir was not 
carcinogenic in a 2-year rat study up to the highest dosage tested (300 mg/30 mg/kg/day), resulting in 
paritaprevir AUC exposures approximately 8-fold higher than those in humans at 150 mg.
Paritaprevir/ritonavir has shown malformations (open eye lids) at a low incidence in mice at exposures 
32/8-fold higher than the exposure in humans at the recommended clinical dose. Paritaprevir/ritonavir had 
no effects on embryo-foetal viability or on fertility when evaluated in rats at exposures 2- to 8-fold higher 
than the exposure in humans at the recommended clinical dose.
Paritaprevir and its hydrolysis product M13 were the predominant components observed in the milk of 
lactating rats, without effect on nursing pups.  Paritaprevir -derived material was minimally transferred 
through the placenta in pregnant rats.

Possible side effects
1. What Viekirax is and what it is used for
Viekirax contains the active substances ombitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir. It is an antiviral medicine 
used to treat adults with chronic (long-term) hepatitis C (an infectious disease that affects the liver, caused 
by the hepatitis C virus). 
The combined action of the three active substances stops the hepatitis C virus from multiplying and 
infecting new cells, thus clearing the virus from your blood over a period of time. Ombitasvir and
paritaprevir block two proteins essential for the virus to multiply. Ritonavir acts as a ‘booster’ to prolong 
the action of paritaprevir in the body.
Viekirax tablets are taken with other antiviral medicines such as dasabuvir and ribavirin. Your doctor will 
talk with you about which of these medicines to take with Viekirax.
It is very important that you also read the package leaflets for the other antiviral medicines that you take 
with Viekirax. If you have any questions about your medicines, please ask your doctor or pharmacist.
2. What you need to know before you take Viekirax

thoughts and behaviours, has been reported in some patients taking this medicine, particularly in patients 
with a prior history of depression or psychiatric illness or in patients taking ribavirin with this medicine. 
You or your caregiver should also immediately inform your doctor of any changes in behaviour or mood 
and of any suicidal thoughts you may have.
Blood tests
Your doctor will test your blood before, during and after your treatment with Viekirax. This is so that your 
doctor can:
 Decide what other medicines you should take with Viekirax and for how long.
 Confirm if your treatment has worked and if you are free of the hepatitis C virus.
 Check for side effects of Viekirax or other antiviral medicines your doctor has prescribed for you to 
use with Viekirax (such as “dasabuvir” and “ribavirin”).

Pregnancy and contraception 
The effects of Viekirax during pregnancy are not known. Viekirax should not be used during pregnancy or 
in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception.
 You or your partner must use an effective method of contraception during treatment. Contraceptive 
medicines that contain ethinyloestradiol cannot be used in combination with Viekirax. Ask your 
doctor about the best contraception for you.
77
Extra precautions are needed if Viekirax is taken together with ribavirin. Ribavirin may cause severe birth 
defects. Ribavirin stays for a long time in the body after treatment is stopped, and effective contraception 
is therefore needed both during treatment and for some time afterwards.
 There is a risk for birth defects when ribavirin is given to a female patient that becomes pregnant. 
 There may also be a risk for birth defects if ribavirin is taken by a male patient, whose female 
partner becomes pregnant. 
 Read the “Contraception” section of the package leaflet for ribavirin very carefully. It is important 
that both men and women read the information.
 If you or your partner becomes pregnant during treatment with Viekirax and ribavirin or in the 
months that follow, you must contact your doctor immediately.
Breastfeeding
You should not breast-feed during treatment with Viekirax. It is not known whether the active substances 
in Viekirax (ombitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir) pass into breast milk.
Driving and using machines 
Some patients have reported feeling very tired when taking Viekirax with other medicines for their hepatitis 
C infection. If you feel tired, do not drive or use machines.
3.

You will take Viekirax for 8, 12 or 24 weeks. Your doctor will tell you how long your treatment will last.
Do not stop taking Viekirax unless your doctor tells you to. It is very important that you complete the full 
course of treatment. This will give the medicines the best chance to clear the hepatitis C virus infection.
If you take more Viekirax than you should
If you accidentally take more than the recommended dose, you should contact your doctor or go to the 
nearest hospital straight away. Keep the medicine pack with you so that you can easily describe what you 
have taken.

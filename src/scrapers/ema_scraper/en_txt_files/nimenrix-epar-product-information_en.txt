4.   CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1   Therapeutic indications 
Nimenrix is indicated for active immunisation of individuals from the age of 6 weeks against invasive 
meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis groups A, C, W-135, and Y. 
4.2   Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Nimenrix should be used in accordance with available official recommendations. 
Primary immunisation 
Infants from 6 weeks to less than 6 months of age: two doses, each of 0.5 ml, should be administered 
with an interval of 2 months between doses. 
Infants from 6 months of age, children, adolescents and adults: a single 0.5 mL dose should be 
administered.  
An additional primary dose of Nimenrix may be considered appropriate for some individuals (see 
section 4.4). 
Booster doses 
Long-term antibody persistence data following vaccination with Nimenrix are available up to 10 years 
after vaccination (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
After completion of the primary immunisation course in infants 6 weeks to less than 12 months of age, 
a booster dose should be given at 12 months of age with an interval of at least 2 months after the last 
Nimenrix vaccination (see section 5.1). 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In previously vaccinated individuals 12 months of age and older, Nimenrix may be given as a booster 
dose if they have received primary vaccination with a conjugated or plain polysaccharide 
meningococcal vaccine (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Method of administration 
Immunisation should be carried out by intramuscular injection only. 
In infants, the recommended injection site is the anterolateral aspect of the thigh. In individuals from 
1 year of age, the recommended injection site is the anterolateral aspect of the thigh or the deltoid 
muscle (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3   Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Nimenrix should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly, intradermally or 
subcutaneously. 
It is good clinical practice to precede vaccination by a review of the medical history (especially with 
regard to previous vaccination and possible occurrence of undesirable effects) and a clinical 
examination. 
Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare 
anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. 
Intercurrent illness 
Vaccination with Nimenrix should be postponed in subjects suffering from an acute severe febrile 
illness. The presence of a minor infection, such as a cold, should not result in the deferral of 
vaccination. 
Syncope 
Syncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination especially in adolescents as 
a psychogenic response to the needle injection. This can be accompanied by several neurological 
signs such as transient visual disturbance, paraesthesia and tonic-clonic limb movements during 
recovery. It is important that procedures are in place to avoid injury from faints. 
Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders 
Nimenrix should be given with caution to individuals with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation 
disorder since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration to these subjects.

Immunodeficiency 
It may be expected that in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment or patients with 
immunodeficiency, an adequate immune response may not be elicited. 
Persons with familial complement deficiencies (for example, C5 or C3 deficiencies) and persons 
receiving treatments that inhibit terminal complement activation (for example, eculizumab) are at 
increased risk for invasive disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis groups A, C, W-135 and Y, even 
if they develop antibodies following vaccination with Nimenrix. 
Protection against meningococcal disease 
Nimenrix will only confer protection against Neisseria meningitidis groups A, C, W-135 and Y. The 
vaccine will not protect against any other Neisseria meningitidis groups. 
A protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccinees. 
Effect of prior vaccination with plain polysaccharide meningococcal vaccine 
Subjects previously vaccinated with a plain polysaccharide meningococcal vaccine and vaccinated 
with Nimenrix 30 to 42 months later had lower Geometric Mean Titres (GMTs) measured with a 
serum bactericidal assay using rabbit complement (rSBA) than subjects who had not been vaccinated 
with any meningococcal vaccine in the preceding 10 years (see section 5.1). The clinical relevance of 
this observation is unknown. 
Effect of pre-vaccination antibody to tetanus toxoid 
The safety and immunogenicity of Nimenrix was evaluated when it was sequentially administered or 
co-administered with a vaccine containing, diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, acellular pertussis, 
inactivated polioviruses (1, 2 and 3), hepatitis B surface antigen and Haemophilus influenzae type b 
polyribosyl ribose phosphate conjugated to tetanus toxoid (DTaP-HBV-IPV/Hib) in the second year of 
life. The administration of Nimenrix one month after the DTaP-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine resulted in 
lower rSBA GMTs against groups A, C and W-135 compared with co-administration (see section 4.5). 
The clinical relevance of this observation is unknown. 
Immune response in infants aged 6 months to less than 12 months 
A single dose administered at 6 months was associated with lower human complement serum 
bactericidal assay (hSBA) titres to groups W-135 and Y compared with three doses administered at 2, 
4, and 6 months (see section 5.1). The clinical relevance of this observation is unknown. If an infant 
aged 6 months to less than 12 months is expected to be at particular risk of invasive meningococcal 
disease due to exposure to groups W-135 and/or Y, consideration may be given to administering a 
second primary dose of Nimenrix after an interval of 2 months. 
Immune responses in toddlers aged 12-14 months 
Toddlers aged 12-14 months had similar rSBA titres to groups A, C, W-135 and Y at one month after 
one dose of Nimenrix or at one month after two doses of Nimenrix given two months apart. 
A single dose was associated with lower hSBA titres to groups W-135 and Y compared with two 
doses given two months apart. Similar responses to groups A and C were observed after one or two 
doses (see section 5.1). The clinical relevance of this observation is unknown. If a toddler is expected 
to be at particular risk of invasive meningococcal disease due to exposure to groups W-135 and/or Y, 
consideration may be given to administering a second dose of Nimenrix after an interval of 2 months. 
Regarding waning of antibody against group A or group C after a first dose of Nimenrix in children 
aged 12-23 months, see under Persistence of serum bactericidal antibody titres. 
Persistence of serum bactericidal antibody titres 
Following administration of Nimenrix there is a waning of serum bactericidal antibody titres against 
group A when using hSBA (see section 5.1). The clinical relevance of this observation is unknown. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
However, if an individual is expected to be at particular risk of exposure to group A and received a 
dose of Nimenrix more than approximately one year previously, consideration may be given to 
administering a booster dose. 
A decline in antibody titres over time has been observed for groups A, C, W-135 and Y. The clinical 
relevance of this observation is unknown. A booster dose might be considered in individuals 
vaccinated at toddler age remaining at high risk of exposure to meningococcal disease caused by 
groups A, C, W-135 or Y (see section 5.1). 
Effect of Nimenrix on anti-tetanus antibody concentrations 
Although an increase of the anti-tetanus toxoid (TT) antibody concentrations was observed following 
vaccination with Nimenrix, Nimenrix does not substitute for tetanus immunisation. 
Giving Nimenrix with or one month before a TT-containing vaccine in the second year of life does not 
impair the response to TT or significantly affect safety. No data are available beyond the age of 
2 years. 
Sodium content 
This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’.  
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
In infants, Nimenrix can be given concomitantly with combined DTaP-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccines and 
with 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. 
From age 1 year and above, Nimenrix can be given concomitantly with any of the following vaccines: 
hepatitis A (HAV) and hepatitis B (HBV) vaccines, measles - mumps - rubella (MMR) vaccine, 
measles - mumps - rubella - varicella (MMRV) vaccine, 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine or 
unadjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine. 
In the second year of life, Nimenrix can also be given concomitantly with combined diphtheria - 
tetanus - acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccines, including combination DTaP vaccines with hepatitis B, 
inactivated poliovirus or Haemophilus influenzae type b (HBV, IPV or Hib) such as DTaP-HBV-
IPV/Hib vaccine, and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. 
In individuals aged 9 to 25 years, Nimenrix can be given concomitantly with human papillomavirus 
bivalent [Type 16 and 18] vaccine, recombinant (HPV2). 
Whenever possible, Nimenrix and a TT containing vaccine, such as DTaP-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine, 
should be co-administered or Nimenrix should be administered at least one month before the TT 
containing vaccine. 
One month after co-administration with a 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, lower 
Geometric Mean antibody Concentrations (GMCs) and opsonophagocytic assay (OPA) antibody 
GMTs were observed for one pneumococcal serotype (18C conjugated to tetanus toxoid carrier 
protein). The clinical relevance of this observation is unknown. There was no impact of 
co-administration on immune responses to the other nine pneumococcal serotypes. 
One month after co-administration with a combined tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid and 
acellular pertussis vaccine, adsorbed (Tdap) in subjects aged 9 to 25 years, lower GMCs were 
observed to each pertussis antigen (pertussis toxoid [PT], filamentous haemagglutinin [FHA] and 
pertactin [PRN]). More than 98% of subjects had anti-PT, FHA or PRN concentrations above the 
assay cut-off thresholds. The clinical relevance of these observations is unknown. There was no 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
impact of co-administration on immune responses to Nimenrix or the tetanus or diphtheria antigens 
included in Tdap. 
If Nimenrix is to be given at the same time as another injectable vaccine, the vaccines should always 
be administered at different injection sites. 
It may be expected that in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment, an adequate response may 
not be elicited. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There is limited experience with use of Nimenrix in pregnant women. 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, 
embryo/foetal development, parturition or post-natal development (see section 5.3). 
Nimenrix should be used during pregnancy only when clearly needed, and the possible advantages 
outweigh the potential risks for the foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether Nimenrix is excreted in human milk. 
Nimenrix should only be used during breast-feeding when the possible advantages outweigh the 
potential risks. 
Fertility 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
No studies on the effects of Nimenrix on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. 
However, some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 “Undesirable effects” may affect the ability 
to drive or use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The safety of Nimenrix presented in the table below is based on two clinical study datasets as follows:  
  A pooled analysis of data from 9,621 subjects administered a single dose of Nimenrix. This total 
included 3,079 toddlers (12 months to 23 months), 909 children between 2 and 5 years of age, 
990 children between 6 and 10 years of age, 2,317 adolescents (11 to 17 years) and 2,326 adults 
(18 to 55 years). 
  Data from a study in infants aged 6 to 12 weeks at the time of the first dose (Study 
MenACWY-TT-083), 1,052 subjects received at least one dose of a primary series of 2 or 3 
doses of Nimenrix and 1,008 received a booster dose at approximately 12 months of age. 
Safety data have also been evaluated in a separate study, in which a single dose of Nimenrix was 
administered to 274 individuals aged 56 years and older.

Local and general adverse reactions 
In the 6-12 weeks and in the 12-14 months age groups who received 2 doses of Nimenrix given 
2 months apart, the first and second doses were associated with similar local and systemic 
reactogenicity. 
The local and general adverse reaction profile of a booster dose of Nimenrix given to subjects from 
12 months through 30 years of age after primary vaccination with Nimenrix or other conjugated or 
plain polysaccharide meningococcal vaccines, was similar to the local and general adverse reaction 
profile observed after primary vaccination with Nimenrix, except for gastrointestinal symptoms 
(including diarrhoea, vomiting, and nausea), which were very common among subjects 6 years of age 
and older.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: vaccines, meningococcal vaccines, ATC code: J07AH08 
Mechanism of action 
Anti-capsular meningococcal antibodies protect against meningococcal disease via complement 
mediated bactericidal activity. Nimenrix induces the production of bactericidal antibodies against 
capsular polysaccharides of Neisseria meningitidis groups A, C, W-135 and Y when measured by 
assays using either rSBA or hSBA. 
Immunogenicity in infants 
In Study MenACWY-TT-083, the first dose was administered at 6 to 12 weeks of age, the second after 
an interval of 2 months, and a third (booster) dose administered at approximately 12 months of age. 
DTaP-HBV-IPV/Hib and a 10-valent pneumococcal vaccine were co-administered. Nimenrix elicited 
rSBA and hSBA titres against the four meningococcal groups as shown in Table 2. The response 
against group C was non-inferior to the one elicited by licensed MenC-CRM and MenC-TT vaccines 
in terms of percentages with rSBA titres ≥8 at 1 month after the second dose.  
Data from this study support the extrapolation of the immunogenicity data and posology to infants 
from 12 weeks to less than 6 months of age.

In Study MenACWY-TT-087, infants received either a single primary dose at 6 months followed by a 
booster dose at 15-18 months (DTaP-IPV/Hib and 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was 
co-administered at both vaccination time points) or three primary doses at 2, 4, and 6 months followed 
by a booster dose at 15-18 months. A single primary dose administered at 6 months of age elicited 
robust rSBA titres to the four meningococcal groups, as measured by the percentage of subjects with 
rSBA titres ≥8, that were comparable to responses after the last dose of a three-dose primary series. A 
booster dose produced robust responses, comparable between the two dosing groups, against all four 
meningococcal groups. Results are shown in Table 3.

The analysis of immunogenicity was conducted on the primary ATP cohort. 
*rSBA analysis performed at PHE laboratories in UK 
**hSBA analysis performed at Neomed in Canada 
(1) blood sampling performed 1 month post vaccination  
Measurement of hSBA titres was a secondary endpoint in Study MenACWY-TT-087. Although 
similar responses to groups A and C were observed with both dosing schedules, a single primary dose 
in infants at 6 months was associated with lower hSBA titres to groups W-135 and Y as measured by 
the percentage of subjects with hSBA titres ≥8 [87.2% (95% CI: 74.3, 95.2) and 92.3% (95% CI: 81.5, 
97.9), respectively] compared with three primary doses at 2, 4, and 6 months of age [100% (95% CI: 
96.6, 100) and 100% (95% CI: 97.1, 100), respectively] (see section 4.4). After a booster dose, hSBA 
titres to all four meningococcal groups were comparable between the two dosing schedules. Results 
are shown in Table 3.

Immunogenicity in toddlers aged 12-23 months 
In clinical studies MenACWY-TT-039 and MenACWY-TT-040, a single dose of Nimenrix elicited 
SBA titres against the four meningococcal groups, with group C rSBA titres that were comparable to 
those elicited by a licensed MenC-CRM vaccine in terms of the percentage of subjects with rSBA 
titres ≥8. In Study MenACWY-TT-039, hSBA was also measured as a secondary endpoint. Results are 
shown in Table 4.

Long-term immunogenicity in toddlers 
Study MenACWY-TT-104 evaluated the immunogenicity after 1 month and the persistence of the 
response up to 5 years following 1 or 2 doses (given 2 months apart) of Nimenrix in toddlers aged 
12 to 14 months. One month following one or two doses Nimenrix elicited rSBA titres against all four 
meningococcal groups that were similar in terms of the percentage of subjects with rSBA titre ≥8 and 
GMT. As a secondary endpoint hSBA titres were measured. One month post dose one or two 
Nimenrix elicited hSBA titres against groups W-135 and Y that were higher in terms of the percentage 
of subjects with hSBA titre ≥8 when two doses were given compared with one (see section 4.4). 
Nimenrix elicited hSBA titres against groups A and C that were similar in terms of the percentage of 
subjects with hSBA titre ≥8 when two doses were given compared with one. At Year 5 only a small 
difference in antibody persistence between one and two doses was observed, in terms of percentages 
of subjects with hSBA titres ≥8 against all groups. Antibody persistence was observed at Year 5 
against groups C, W-135 and Y. After one and two doses the percentages of subjects with hSBA titres 
≥8 for group C were 60.7% and 67.8%, group W-135 were 58.9% and 63.6% and group Y were 61.5% 
and 54.2%, respectively. For group A, 27.9% and 17.9% of subjects receiving one or two doses, 
respectively, had hSBA titres ≥8. Results are shown in Table 5.

*rSBA analysis performed at PHE laboratories 
**hSBA analysis performed at GSK laboratories 
rSBA and hSBA titres were determined over a period of 10 years in children initially vaccinated with 
one dose of Nimenrix or MenC-CRM at 12 to 23 months of age in Study MenACWY-TT-027. 
Persistence of SBA titres was evaluated in two extension studies: MenACWY-TT-032 (up to 5 years) 
and MenACWY-TT-100 (up to 10 years). Study MenACWY-TT-100 also evaluated the response to a 
single booster dose of Nimenrix administered 10 years following the initial vaccination with Nimenrix 
or MenC-CRM. Results are shown in Table 6 (see section 4.4).

The analysis of immunogenicity was conducted on the ATP cohorts for 1 month and 5 years post vaccination 
and the booster ATP cohort. Subjects with a suboptimal response to meningococcal group C (defined as SBA 
titre below the pre-defined assay cut-off) were to receive an additional dose of MenC vaccine before Year 6. 
These subjects were excluded from the analysis at Years 4 and 5 but included in the analysis at Year 10.

(3)  Study MenACWY-TT-100 
(4)  Blood sampling was performed 1 month after a booster dose at Year 10.  
*rSBA analysis performed at GSK laboratories for 1 month post primary vaccination samples and at PHE 
laboratories in UK for subsequent sampling time points. 
** hSBA analysis performed at GSK laboratories and at Neomed in Canada for time points in Study 
MenACWY-TT-100. 
Persistence of booster response 
Study MenACWY-TT-102 evaluated the persistence of SBA titres up to 6 years after a booster dose of 
Nimenrix or MenC-CRM197 administered in Study MenACWY-TT-048 to children who initially 
received the same vaccine at 12 to 23 months of age in Study MenACWY-TT-039. A single booster 
dose was administered 4 years after the initial vaccination. Results are shown in Table 7 
(see section 4.4).

Immunogenicity in children aged 2-10 years 
In Study MenACWY-TT-081, a single dose of Nimenrix was demonstrated to be non-inferior to 
another licensed MenC-CRM vaccine in terms of vaccine response to group C [94.8% (95% CI: 91.4; 
97.1) and 95.7% (95% CI: 89.2; 98.8), respectively]. The GMT was lower for the Nimenrix group 
[2795 (95% CI: 2393; 3263)] versus the MenC-CRM vaccine [5292 (95% CI: 3815; 7340)]. 
In Study MenACWY-TT-038, a single dose of Nimenrix was demonstrated to be non-inferior to the 
licensed ACWY-PS vaccine in terms of vaccine response to the four meningococcal groups as shown 
in Table 8.

VR: vaccine response defined as the proportion of subjects with: 
 
 
rSBA titres ≥32 for initially seronegative subjects (i.e., pre-vaccination rSBA titre <8) 
at least a 4-fold increase in rSBA titres from pre- to post-vaccination for initially seropositive 
subjects (i.e., pre-vaccination rSBA titre ≥8) 
* rSBA analysis performed at GSK laboratories 
Persistence of SBA titres was evaluated in children initially vaccinated in Study MenACWY-TT-081 
as shown in Table 9 (see section 4.4).

The analysis of immunogenicity was conducted on the ATP cohort for persistence at Year 1. 
hSBA analysis was not performed for children aged 2 to <6 years (at time of vaccination).  
* hSBA analysis performed at GSK laboratories 
SBA titres were determined over a period of 10 years in children initially vaccinated with one dose of 
Nimenrix or ACWY-PS at 2 to 10 years of age in Study MenACWY-TT-027. Persistence of SBA 
titres was evaluated in two extension studies: MenACWY-TT-032 (up to 5 years) and MenACWY-
TT-100 (up to 10 years). Study MenACWY-TT-100 also evaluated the response to a single booster 
dose of Nimenrix administered 10 years following the initial vaccination with Nimenrix or ACWY-
PS. Results are shown in Table 11 (see section 4.4).

The analysis of immunogenicity was conducted on the ATP cohort for each time point. Subjects with a 
suboptimal response to meningococcal group C (defined as SBA titre below the pre-defined assay cut-off) were 
to receive an additional dose of MenC vaccine before Year 6. These subjects were excluded from the analysis at 
Year 5 but included in the analyses at Years 6 and 10.

Immunogenicity in adolescents aged 11-17 years and adults aged ≥18 years 
In two clinical studies, conducted in adolescents aged 11-17 years (Study MenACWY-TT-036) and in 
adults aged 18-55 years (Study MenACWY-TT-035), either one dose of Nimenrix or one dose of the 
ACWY-PS vaccine was administered. 
Nimenrix was demonstrated to be immunologically non-inferior to the ACWY-PS vaccine in terms of 
vaccine response as shown in Table 12.

The analysis of immunogenicity was conducted on the ATP cohorts. 
(1)  Blood sampling performed 1 month post vaccination 
VR: vaccine response defined as the proportion of subjects with: 
  rSBA titres ≥32 for initially seronegative subjects (i.e., pre-vaccination rSBA titre <8) 
  at least a 4-fold increase in rSBA titres from pre- to post-vaccination for initially seropositive subjects (i.e., 
pre-vaccination rSBA titre ≥8) 
*rSBA analysis performed at GSK laboratories 
rSBA titres were determined over a period of 10 years in subjects initially vaccinated with one dose of 
Nimenrix or ACWY-PS at 11 to 17 years of age in Study MenACWY-TT-036. Persistence of rSBA 
titres was evaluated in two extension studies: MenACWY-TT-043 (up to 5 years) and MenACWY-
TT-101 (at 10 years). Study MenACWY-TT-101 also evaluated the response to a single booster dose 
of Nimenrix administered 10 years following the initial vaccination with Nimenrix or ACWY-PS. 
Results are shown in Table 13.

The analysis of immunogenicity was conducted on the ATP cohorts for 1 month and 5 years post vaccination 
and the booster ATP cohort. 
(1)  Study MenACWY-TT-015 
(2)  Study MenACWY-TT-020 
(3)  Study MenACWY-TT-099 
(4)  Blood sampling was performed 1 month after a booster dose at Year 10. 
* rSBA analysis performed at GSK laboratories for 1 month post primary vaccination samples and at PHE 
laboratories in UK for the subsequent sampling time points. 
In a separate study (MenACWY-TT-085), a single dose of Nimenrix was administered to 194 
Lebanese adults aged 56 years and older (including 133 aged 56-65 years and 61 aged >65 years). The 
percentage of subjects with rSBA titres (measured at GSK’s laboratories) ≥128 before vaccination 
ranged from 45% (group C) to 62% (group Y). Overall, at 1 month post-vaccination the percentage of 
vaccines with rSBA titres ≥128 ranged from 93% (group C) to 97% (group Y). In the subgroup aged 
>65 years the percentage of vaccines with rSBA titres ≥128 at 1 month post-vaccination ranged from 
90% (group A) to 97% (group Y). 
Booster response for subjects previously vaccinated with a conjugate meningococcal vaccine against 
Neisseria meningitidis 
Nimenrix booster vaccination in subjects previously primed with a monovalent (MenC-CRM) or a 
quadrivalent conjugate meningococcal vaccine (MenACWY-TT) was studied in subjects from 
12 months of age onwards who received a booster vaccination. Robust anamnestic responses to the 
antigen(s) in the priming vaccine were observed (see Tables 6, 7, 11, 13, and 15). 
Response to Nimenrix in subjects previously vaccinated with a plain polysaccharide vaccine against 
Neisseria meningitidis 
In Study MenACWY-TT-021 conducted in subjects aged 4.5-34 years, the immunogenicity of 
Nimenrix administered between 30 and 42 months after vaccination with a ACWY-PS vaccine was 
compared to the immunogenicity of Nimenrix administered to age-matched subjects who had not been 
vaccinated with any meningococcal vaccine in the preceding 10 years. An immune response (rSBA 
titre ≥8) was observed against all four meningococcal groups in all subjects regardless of the 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
meningococcal vaccine history. The rSBA GMTs were significantly lower in the subjects who had 
received a dose of ACWY-PS vaccine 30-42 months prior to Nimenrix, however 100% of subjects 
achieved rSBA titres ≥8 for all four meningococcal groups (A, C, W-135, Y) (see section 4.4). 
Children (2-17 years) with anatomical or functional asplenia 
Study MenACWY-TT-084 compared immune responses to two doses of Nimenrix given 2 months 
apart between 43 subjects aged 2-17 years with anatomic or functional asplenia subjects and 
43 age-matched subjects with normal splenic function. One month after the first vaccine dose and 
1 month after the second dose similar percentages of subjects in the two groups had rSBA titres ≥8 and 
≥128 and hSBA titres ≥4 and ≥8. 
Impact of a single dose of Nimenrix 
In 2018, the Netherlands added Nimenrix to the national immunisation programme as a single dose for 
toddlers at 14 months of age to replace the meningococcal C conjugate vaccine. A catch-up campaign 
with a single dose of Nimenrix for adolescents 14-18 years of age also initiated in 2018, and it became 
routine in 2020 leading to a toddler and adolescent national immunisation programme. Within two 
years, the incidence of meningococcal disease caused by groups C, W, and Y was significantly 
reduced by 100% (95% CI: 14, 100) in individuals 14-18 years of age, 85% (95% CI: 32, 97) in all 
vaccine eligible ages (direct effect), and 50% (95% CI: 28, 65) in non-vaccine eligible ages (indirect 
effect). The impact of Nimenrix was primarily driven by a reduction in group W disease.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Nimenrix is indicated for active immunisation of individuals from the age of 6 weeks against invasive 
meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis groups A, C, W-135, and Y. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Nimenrix should be used in accordance with available official recommendations. 
Primary immunisation 
Infants from 6 weeks to less than 6 months of age: two doses, each of 0.5 ml, should be administered 
with an interval of 2 months between doses. 
Infants from 6 months of age, children, adolescents and adults: a single 0.5 mL dose should be 
administered.  
An additional primary dose of Nimenrix may be considered appropriate for some individuals (see 
section 4.4). 
Booster doses 
Long-term antibody persistence data following vaccination with Nimenrix are available up to 10 years 
after vaccination (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
After completion of the primary immunisation course in infants 6 weeks to less than 12 months of age, 
a booster dose should be given at 12 months of age with an interval of at least 2 months after the last 
Nimenrix vaccination (see section 5.1). 
29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In previously vaccinated individuals 12 months of age and older, Nimenrix may be given as a booster 
dose if they have received primary vaccination with a conjugated or plain polysaccharide 
meningococcal vaccine (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Method of administration 
Immunisation should be carried out by intramuscular injection only. 
In infants, the recommended injection site is the anterolateral aspect of the thigh. In individuals from 
1 year of age, the recommended injection site is the anterolateral aspect of the thigh or the deltoid 
muscle (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Nimenrix should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly, intradermally or 
subcutaneously. 
It is good clinical practice to precede vaccination by a review of the medical history (especially with 
regard to previous vaccination and possible occurrence of undesirable effects) and a clinical 
examination. 
Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare 
anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. 
Intercurrent illness 
Vaccination with Nimenrix should be postponed in subjects suffering from an acute severe febrile 
illness. The presence of a minor infection, such as a cold, should not result in the deferral of 
vaccination. 
Syncope 
Syncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination especially in adolescents as 
a psychogenic response to the needle injection. This can be accompanied by several neurological 
signs such as transient visual disturbance, paraesthesia and tonic-clonic limb movements during 
recovery. It is important that procedures are in place to avoid injury from faints. 
Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders 
Nimenrix should be given with caution to individuals with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation 
disorder since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration to these subjects. 
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Immunodeficiency 
It may be expected that in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment or patients with 
immunodeficiency, an adequate immune response may not be elicited. 
Persons with familial complement deficiencies (for example, C5 or C3 deficiencies) and persons 
receiving treatments that inhibit terminal complement activation (for example, eculizumab) are at 
increased risk for invasive disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis groups A, C, W-135 and Y, even 
if they develop antibodies following vaccination with Nimenrix. 
Protection against meningococcal disease 
Nimenrix will only confer protection against Neisseria meningitidis groups A, C, W-135 and Y. The 
vaccine will not protect against any other Neisseria meningitidis groups. 
A protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccinees. 
Effect of prior vaccination with plain polysaccharide meningococcal vaccine 
Subjects previously vaccinated with a plain polysaccharide meningococcal vaccine and vaccinated 
with Nimenrix 30 to 42 months later had lower Geometric Mean Titres (GMTs) measured with a 
serum bactericidal assay using rabbit complement (rSBA) than subjects who had not been vaccinated 
with any meningococcal vaccine in the preceding 10 years (see section 5.1). The clinical relevance of 
this observation is unknown. 
Effect of pre-vaccination antibody to tetanus toxoid 
The safety and immunogenicity of Nimenrix was evaluated when it was sequentially administered or 
co-administered with a vaccine containing, diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, acellular pertussis, 
inactivated polioviruses (1, 2 and 3), hepatitis B surface antigen and Haemophilus influenzae type b 
polyribosyl ribose phosphate conjugated to tetanus toxoid (DTaP-HBV-IPV/Hib) in the second year of 
life. The administration of Nimenrix one month after the DTaP-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine resulted in 
lower rSBA GMTs against groups A, C and W-135 compared with co-administration (see section 4.5). 
The clinical relevance of this observation is unknown. 
Immune response in infants aged 6 months to less than 12 months 
A single dose administered at 6 months was associated with lower human complement serum 
bactericidal assay (hSBA) titres to groups W-135 and Y compared with three doses administered at 2, 
4, and 6 months (see section 5.1). The clinical relevance of this observation is unknown. If an infant 
aged 6 months to less than 12 months is expected to be at particular risk of invasive meningococcal 
disease due to exposure to groups W-135 and/or Y, consideration may be given to administering a 
second primary dose of Nimenrix after an interval of 2 months. 
Immune responses in toddlers aged 12-14 months 
Toddlers aged 12-14 months had similar rSBA titres to groups A, C, W-135 and Y at one month after 
one dose of Nimenrix or at one month after two doses of Nimenrix given two months apart. 
A single dose was associated with lower hSBA titres to groups W-135 and Y compared with two 
doses given two months apart. Similar responses to groups A and C were observed after one or two 
doses (see section 5.1). The clinical relevance of this observation is unknown. If a toddler is expected 
to be at particular risk of invasive meningococcal disease due to exposure to groups W-135 and/or Y, 
consideration may be given to administering a second dose of Nimenrix after an interval of 2 months. 
Regarding waning of antibody against group A or group C after a first dose of Nimenrix in children 
aged 12-23 months, see under Persistence of serum bactericidal antibody titres. 
Persistence of serum bactericidal antibody titres 
Following administration of Nimenrix there is a waning of serum bactericidal antibody titres against 
group A when using hSBA (see section 5.1). The clinical relevance of this observation is unknown. 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
However, if an individual is expected to be at particular risk of exposure to group A and received a 
dose of Nimenrix more than approximately one year previously, consideration may be given to 
administering a booster dose. 
A decline in antibody titres over time has been observed for groups A, C, W-135 and Y. The clinical 
relevance of this observation is unknown. A booster dose might be considered in individuals 
vaccinated at toddler age remaining at high risk of exposure to meningococcal disease caused by 
groups A, C, W-135 or Y (see section 5.1). 
Effect of Nimenrix on anti-tetanus antibody concentrations 
Although an increase of the anti-tetanus toxoid (TT) antibody concentrations was observed following 
vaccination with Nimenrix, Nimenrix does not substitute for tetanus immunisation. 
Giving Nimenrix with or one month before a TT-containing vaccine in the second year of life does not 
impair the response to TT or significantly affect safety. No data are available beyond the age of 
2 years. 
Sodium content 
This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’.  
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
In infants, Nimenrix can be given concomitantly with combined DTaP-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccines and 
with 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. 
From age 1 year and above, Nimenrix can be given concomitantly with any of the following vaccines: 
hepatitis A (HAV) and hepatitis B (HBV) vaccines, measles - mumps - rubella (MMR) vaccine, 
measles - mumps - rubella - varicella (MMRV) vaccine, 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine or 
unadjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine. 
In the second year of life, Nimenrix can also be given concomitantly with combined diphtheria - 
tetanus - acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccines, including combination DTaP vaccines with hepatitis B, 
inactivated poliovirus or Haemophilus influenzae type b (HBV, IPV or Hib) such as DTaP-HBV-
IPV/Hib vaccine, and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. 
In individuals aged 9 to 25 years, Nimenrix can be given concomitantly with human papillomavirus 
bivalent [Type 16 and 18] vaccine, recombinant (HPV2). 
Whenever possible, Nimenrix and a TT containing vaccine, such as DTaP-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine, 
should be co-administered or Nimenrix should be administered at least one month before the TT 
containing vaccine. 
One month after co-administration with a 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, lower 
Geometric Mean antibody Concentrations (GMCs) and opsonophagocytic assay (OPA) antibody 
GMTs were observed for one pneumococcal serotype (18C conjugated to tetanus toxoid carrier 
protein). The clinical relevance of this observation is unknown. There was no impact of 
co-administration on immune responses to the other nine pneumococcal serotypes. 
One month after co-administration with a combined tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid and 
acellular pertussis vaccine, adsorbed (Tdap) in subjects aged 9 to 25 years, lower GMCs were 
observed to each pertussis antigen (pertussis toxoid [PT], filamentous haemagglutinin [FHA] and 
pertactin [PRN]). More than 98% of subjects had anti-PT, FHA or PRN concentrations above the 
assay cut-off thresholds. The clinical relevance of these observations is unknown. There was no 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
impact of co-administration on immune responses to Nimenrix or the tetanus or diphtheria antigens 
included in Tdap. 
If Nimenrix is to be given at the same time as another injectable vaccine, the vaccines should always 
be administered at different injection sites. 
It may be expected that in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment, an adequate response may 
not be elicited. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There is limited experience with use of Nimenrix in pregnant women. 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, 
embryo/foetal development, parturition or post-natal development (see section 5.3). 
Nimenrix should be used during pregnancy only when clearly needed, and the possible advantages 
outweigh the potential risks for the foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether Nimenrix is excreted in human milk. 
Nimenrix should only be used during breast-feeding when the possible advantages outweigh the 
potential risks. 
Fertility 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
No studies on the effects of Nimenrix on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. 
However, some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 “Undesirable effects” may affect the ability 
to drive or use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The safety of Nimenrix presented in the table below is based on two clinical study datasets as follows:  
  A pooled analysis of data from 9,621 subjects administered a single dose of Nimenrix. This 
total included 3,079 toddlers (12 months to 23 months), 909 children between 2 and 5 years of 
age, 990 children between 6 and 10 years of age, 2,317 adolescents (11 to 17 years) and 2,326 
adults (18 to 55 years). 
  Data from a study in infants aged 6 to 12 weeks at the time of the first dose (Study 
MenACWY-TT-083), 1,052 subjects received at least one dose of a primary series of 2 or 3 
doses of Nimenrix and 1,008 received a booster dose at approximately 12 months of age. 
Safety data have also been evaluated in a separate study, in which a single dose of Nimenrix was 
administered to 274 individuals aged 56 years and older. 
33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Local and general adverse reactions 
In the 6-12 weeks and in the 12-14 months age groups who received 2 doses of Nimenrix given 
2 months apart, the first and second doses were associated with similar local and systemic 
reactogenicity. 
The local and general adverse reaction profile of a booster dose of Nimenrix given to subjects from 
12 months through 30 years of age after primary vaccination with Nimenrix or other conjugated or 
plain polysaccharide meningococcal vaccines, was similar to the local and general adverse reaction 
profile observed after primary vaccination with Nimenrix, except for gastrointestinal symptoms 
(including diarrhoea, vomiting, and nausea), which were very common among subjects 6 years of age 
and older.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: vaccines, meningococcal vaccines, ATC code: J07AH08 
Mechanism of action 
Anti-capsular meningococcal antibodies protect against meningococcal disease via complement 
mediated bactericidal activity. Nimenrix induces the production of bactericidal antibodies against 
capsular polysaccharides of Neisseria meningitidis groups A, C, W-135 and Y when measured by 
assays using either rSBA or hSBA. 
Immunogenicity in infants 
In Study MenACWY-TT-083, the first dose was administered at 6 to 12 weeks of age, the second after 
an interval of 2 months, and a third (booster) dose administered at approximately 12 months of age. 
DTaP-HBV-IPV/Hib and a 10-valent pneumococcal vaccine were co-administered. Nimenrix elicited 
rSBA and hSBA titres against the four meningococcal groups as shown in Table 2. The response 
against group C was non-inferior to the one elicited by licensed MenC-CRM and MenC-TT vaccines 
in terms of percentages with rSBA titres ≥8 at 1 month after the second dose.  
Data from this study support the extrapolation of the immunogenicity data and posology to infants 
from 12 weeks to less than 6 months of age.

In Study MenACWY-TT-087, infants received either a single primary dose at 6 months followed by a 
booster dose at 15-18 months (DTaP-IPV/Hib and 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was 
co-administered at both vaccination time points) or three primary doses at 2, 4, and 6 months followed 
by a booster dose at 15-18 months. A single primary dose administered at 6 months of age elicited 
robust rSBA titres to the four meningococcal groups, as measured by the percentage of subjects with 
rSBA titres ≥8, that were comparable to responses after the last dose of a three-dose primary series. A 
booster dose produced robust responses, comparable between the two dosing groups, against all four 
meningococcal groups. Results are shown in Table 3.

The analysis of immunogenicity was conducted on the primary ATP cohort. 
*rSBA analysis performed at PHE laboratories in UK 
**hSBA analysis performed at Neomed in Canada 
(1) blood sampling performed 1 month post vaccination  
Measurement of hSBA titres was a secondary endpoint in Study MenACWY-TT-087. Although 
similar responses to groups A and C were observed with both dosing schedules, a single primary dose 
in infants at 6 months was associated with lower hSBA titres to groups W-135 and Y as measured by 
the percentage of subjects with hSBA titres ≥8 [87.2% (95% CI: 74.3, 95.2) and 92.3% (95% CI: 81.5, 
97.9), respectively] compared with three primary doses at 2, 4, and 6 months of age [100% (95% CI: 
96.6, 100) and 100% (95% CI: 97.1, 100), respectively] (see section 4.4). After a booster dose, hSBA 
titres to all four meningococcal groups were comparable between the two dosing schedules. Results 
are shown in Table 3.

Immunogenicity in toddlers aged 12-23 months 
In clinical studies MenACWY-TT-039 and MenACWY-TT-040, a single dose of Nimenrix elicited 
SBA titres against the four meningococcal groups, with group C rSBA titres that were comparable to 
those elicited by a licensed MenC-CRM vaccine in terms of the percentage of subjects with rSBA 
titres ≥8. In Study MenACWY-TT-039, hSBA was also measured as a secondary endpoint. Results are 
shown in Table 4.

Long-term immunogenicity in toddlers 
Study MenACWY-TT-104 evaluated the immunogenicity after 1 month and the persistence of the 
response up to 5 years following 1 or 2 doses (given 2 months apart) of Nimenrix in toddlers aged 
12 to 14 months. One month following one or two doses Nimenrix elicited rSBA titres against all four 
meningococcal groups that were similar in terms of the percentage of subjects with rSBA titre ≥8 and 
GMT. As a secondary endpoint hSBA titres were measured. One month post dose one or two 
Nimenrix elicited hSBA titres against groups W-135 and Y that were higher in terms of the percentage 
of subjects with hSBA titre ≥8 when two doses were given compared with one (see section 4.4). 
Nimenrix elicited hSBA titres against groups A and C that were similar in terms of the percentage of 
subjects with hSBA titre ≥8 when two doses were given compared with one. At Year 5 only a small 
difference in antibody persistence between one and two doses was observed, in terms of percentages 
of subjects with hSBA titres ≥8 against all groups. Antibody persistence was observed at Year 5 
against groups C, W-135 and Y. After one and two doses the percentages of subjects with hSBA titres 
≥8 for group C were 60.7% and 67.8%, group W-135 were 58.9% and 63.6% and group Y were 61.5% 
and 54.2%, respectively. For group A, 27.9% and 17.9% of subjects receiving one or two doses, 
respectively, had hSBA titres ≥8. Results are shown in Table 5.

rSBA and hSBA titres were determined over a period of 10 years in children initially vaccinated with 
one dose of Nimenrix or MenC-CRM at 12 to 23 months of age in Study MenACWY-TT-027. 
Persistence of SBA titres was evaluated in two extension studies: MenACWY-TT-032 (up to 5 years) 
and MenACWY-TT-100 (up to 10 years). Study MenACWY-TT-100 also evaluated the response to a 
single booster dose of Nimenrix administered 10 years following the initial vaccination with Nimenrix 
or MenC-CRM. Results are shown in Table 6 (see section 4.4).

The analysis of immunogenicity was conducted on the ATP cohorts for 1 month and 5 years post vaccination 
and the booster ATP cohort. Subjects with a suboptimal response to meningococcal group C (defined as SBA 
titre below the pre-defined assay cut-off) were to receive an additional dose of MenC vaccine before Year 6. 
These subjects were excluded from the analysis at Years 4 and 5 but included in the analysis at Year 10.

(2)  Study MenACWY-TT-032 
(3)  Study MenACWY-TT-100 
(4)  Blood sampling was performed 1 month after a booster dose at Year 10.  
*rSBA analysis performed at GSK laboratories for 1 month post primary vaccination samples and at PHE 
laboratories in UK for subsequent sampling time points. 
** hSBA analysis performed at GSK laboratories and at Neomed in Canada for time points in Study 
MenACWY-TT-100. 
Persistence of booster response 
Study MenACWY-TT-102 evaluated the persistence of SBA titres up to 6 years after a booster dose of 
Nimenrix or MenC-CRM197 administered in Study MenACWY-TT-048 to children who initially 
received the same vaccine at 12 to 23 months of age in Study MenACWY-TT-039. A single booster 
dose was administered 4 years after the initial vaccination. Results are shown in Table 7 
(see section 4.4).

Immunogenicity in children aged 2-10 years 
In Study MenACWY-TT-081, a single dose of Nimenrix was demonstrated to be non-inferior to 
another licensed MenC-CRM vaccine in terms of vaccine response to group C [94.8% (95% CI: 91.4; 
97.1) and 95.7% (95% CI: 89.2; 98.8), respectively]. The GMT was lower for the Nimenrix group 
[2795 (95% CI: 2393; 3263)] versus the MenC-CRM vaccine [5292 (95% CI: 3815; 7340)]. 
In Study MenACWY-TT-038, a single dose of Nimenrix was demonstrated to be non-inferior to the 
licensed ACWY-PS vaccine in terms of vaccine response to the four meningococcal groups as shown 
in Table 8.

The analysis of immunogenicity was conducted on the ATP cohort for persistence at Year 1. 
hSBA analysis was not performed for children aged 2 to <6 years (at time of vaccination).  
* hSBA analysis performed at GSK laboratories 
SBA titres were determined over a period of 10 years in children initially vaccinated with one dose of 
Nimenrix or ACWY-PS at 2 to 10 years of age in Study MenACWY-TT-027. Persistence of SBA 
titres was evaluated in two extension studies: MenACWY-TT-032 (up to 5 years) and MenACWY-
TT-100 (up to 10 years). Study MenACWY-TT-100 also evaluated the response to a single booster 
dose of Nimenrix administered 10 years following the initial vaccination with Nimenrix or ACWY-
PS. Results are shown in Table 11 (see section 4.4).

to receive an additional dose of MenC vaccine before Year 6. These subjects were excluded from the analysis at 
Year 5 but included in the analyses at Years 6 and 10.

Immunogenicity in adolescents aged 11-17 years and adults aged ≥ 18 years 
In two clinical studies, conducted in adolescents aged 11-17 years (Study MenACWY-TT-036) and in 
adults aged 18-55 years (Study MenACWY-TT-035), either one dose of Nimenrix or one dose of the 
ACWY-PS vaccine was administered. 
Nimenrix was demonstrated to be immunologically non-inferior to the ACWY-PS vaccine in terms of 
vaccine response as shown in Table 12.

The analysis of immunogenicity was conducted on the ATP cohorts. 
(1)  Blood sampling performed 1 month post vaccination 
VR: vaccine response defined as the proportion of subjects with: 
  rSBA titres ≥32 for initially seronegative subjects (i.e., pre-vaccination rSBA titre <8) 
  at least a 4-fold increase in rSBA titres from pre- to post-vaccination for initially seropositive subjects (i.e., 
pre-vaccination rSBA titre ≥8) 
*rSBA analysis performed at GSK laboratories 
rSBA titres were determined over a period of 10 years in subjects initially vaccinated with one dose of 
Nimenrix or ACWY-PS at 11 to 17 years of age in Study MenACWY-TT-036. Persistence of rSBA 
titres was evaluated in two extension studies: MenACWY-TT-043 (up to 5 years) and MenACWY-
TT-101 (at 10 years). Study MenACWY-TT-101 also evaluated the response to a single booster dose 
of Nimenrix administered 10 years following the initial vaccination with Nimenrix or ACWY-PS. 
Results are shown in Table 13.

The analysis of immunogenicity was conducted on the ATP cohorts for 1 month and 5 years post vaccination 
and the booster ATP cohort. 
(1)  Study MenACWY-TT-015 
(2)  Study MenACWY-TT-020 
(3)  Study MenACWY-TT-099 
(4)  Blood sampling was performed 1 month after a booster dose at Year 10. 
* rSBA analysis performed at GSK laboratories for 1 month post primary vaccination samples and at PHE 
laboratories in UK for the subsequent sampling time points. 
In a separate study (MenACWY-TT-085), a single dose of Nimenrix was administered to 194 
Lebanese adults aged 56 years and older (including 133 aged 56-65 years and 61 aged >65 years). The 
percentage of subjects with rSBA titres (measured at GSK’s laboratories) ≥128 before vaccination 
ranged from 45% (group C) to 62% (group Y). Overall, at 1 month post-vaccination the percentage of 
vaccines with rSBA titres ≥128 ranged from 93% (group C) to 97% (group Y). In the subgroup aged 
>65 years the percentage of vaccines with rSBA titres ≥128 at 1 month post-vaccination ranged from 
90% (group A) to 97% (group Y). 
Booster response for subjects previously vaccinated with a conjugate meningococcal vaccine against 
Neisseria meningitidis 
Nimenrix booster vaccination in subjects previously primed with a monovalent (MenC-CRM) or a 
quadrivalent conjugate meningococcal vaccine (MenACWY-TT) was studied in subjects from 
12 months of age onwards who received a booster vaccination. Robust anamnestic responses to the 
antigen(s) in the priming vaccine were observed (see Tables 6, 7, 11, 13, and 15). 
Response to Nimenrix in subjects previously vaccinated with a plain polysaccharide vaccine against 
Neisseria meningitidis 
In Study MenACWY-TT-021 conducted in subjects aged 4.5-34 years, the immunogenicity of 
Nimenrix administered between 30 and 42 months after vaccination with a ACWY-PS vaccine was 
compared to the immunogenicity of Nimenrix administered to age-matched subjects who had not been 
51 
 
 
 
 
 
vaccinated with any meningococcal vaccine in the preceding 10 years. An immune response (rSBA 
titre ≥8) was observed against all four meningococcal groups in all subjects regardless of the 
meningococcal vaccine history. The rSBA GMTs were significantly lower in the subjects who had 
received a dose of ACWY-PS vaccine 30-42 months prior to Nimenrix, however 100% of subjects 
achieved rSBA titres ≥8 for all four meningococcal groups (A, C, W-135, Y) (see section 4.4). 
Children (2-17 years) with anatomical or functional asplenia 
Study MenACWY-TT-084 compared immune responses to two doses of Nimenrix given 2 months 
apart between 43 subjects aged 2-17 years with anatomic or functional asplenia subjects and 
43 age-matched subjects with normal splenic function. One month after the first vaccine dose and 
1 month after the second dose similar percentages of subjects in the two groups had rSBA titres ≥8 and 
≥128 and hSBA titres ≥4 and ≥8. 
Impact of a single dose of Nimenrix 
In 2018, the Netherlands added Nimenrix to the national immunisation programme as a single dose for 
toddlers at 14 months of age to replace the meningococcal C conjugate vaccine. A catch-up campaign 
with a single dose of Nimenrix for adolescents 14-18 years of age also initiated in 2018, and it became 
routine in 2020 leading to a toddler and adolescent national immunisation programme. Within two 
years, the incidence of meningococcal disease caused by groups C, W, and Y was significantly 
reduced by 100% (95% CI: 14, 100) in individuals 14-18 years of age, 85% (95% CI: 32, 97) in all 
vaccine eligible ages (direct effect), and 50% (95% CI: 28, 65) in non-vaccine eligible ages (indirect 
effect). The impact of Nimenrix was primarily driven by a reduction in group W disease.

Package leaflet: Information for the user 
Nimenrix powder and solvent for solution for injection in pre-filled syringe 
Meningococcal groups A, C, W-135 and Y conjugate vaccine 
Read all of this leaflet carefully before you receive this vaccine because it contains important 
information for you. 
 
 
 
 
Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. 
If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
This vaccine has been prescribed for you or your child. Do not pass it on to others. 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Nimenrix is and what it is used for 
What Nimenrix is and what it is used for 
Nimenrix is a vaccine which helps protect against infections caused by bacteria (germs) called 
“Neisseria meningitidis" types A, C, W-135 and Y. 
“Neisseria meningitidis" types A, C, W-135 and Y bacteria can cause serious illnesses such as: 
  meningitis - an infection of the tissue that lines the brain and spinal cord. 
  septicaemia - an infection of the blood. 
These infections are passed easily from person to person and can cause death if not treated. 
Nimenrix may be given to adults, adolescents, children and infants over the age of 6 weeks. 
How Nimenrix works 
Nimenrix helps your body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the bacteria. These 
antibodies help protect you against the diseases. 
Nimenrix will only protect against infections caused by the bacteria “Neisseria meningitidis” types A, 
C, W-135 and Y. 
2.  What you need to know before you receive Nimenrix 
Nimenrix should not be given if: 
 
you are allergic to the active substances or any of the other ingredients in this vaccine (listed in 
section 6). 
Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the 
face or tongue. See your doctor immediately if you notice any of these. 
If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before you receive Nimenrix. 
68 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Warnings and precautions: 
Check with your doctor or nurse before you receive this vaccine if: 
 
you have an infection with a high temperature (over 38°C). If this applies to you, the 
vaccination will not be given until you are feeling better. A minor infection such as a cold 
should not be a problem. However, talk to your doctor or nurse first. 
you have a bleeding problem or you bruise easily. 
 
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse before you receive 
Nimenrix. 
Nimenrix may not fully protect everyone who is vaccinated. If you have a weak immune system (such 
as due to HIV infection or medicines that affect the immune system) you may not get a full benefit 
from Nimenrix. 
Fainting can occur (mostly in adolescents) following, or even before, any needle injection. Therefore 
tell the doctor or nurse if you or your child fainted with a previous injection. 
Other medicines and Nimenrix 
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including other 
vaccines and medicines obtained without a prescription. 
Nimenrix may not work as well if you are taking medicines that affect your immune system. 
In infants, Nimenrix can be given concomitantly with combined diphtheria - tetanus - acellular 
pertussis (DTaP) vaccines, including combination DTaP vaccines with hepatitis B, inactivated 
poliovirus or Haemophilus influenzae type b (HBV, IPV or Hib) such as DTaP-HBV-IPV/Hib 
vaccine, and with 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. 
From age 1 year and above, Nimenrix can be given concomitantly with any of the following vaccines: 
hepatitis A (HAV) and hepatitis B (HBV) vaccines, measles - mumps - rubella (MMR) vaccine, 
measles - mumps - rubella - varicella (MMRV) vaccine, 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine or 
unadjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine. 
In the second year of life, Nimenrix can also be given concomitantly with combined diphtheria - 
tetanus - acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccines, including combination DTaP vaccines with hepatitis B, 
inactivated poliovirus or Haemophilus influenzae type b (HBV, IPV or Hib) such as DTaP-HBV-
IPV/Hib vaccine, and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. 
In individuals aged 9 to 25 years, Nimenrix can be given concomitantly with human papillomavirus 
vaccine [Types 16, 18] and a combined diphtheria (reduced antigen content), tetanus and acellular 
pertussis vaccine. 
Whenever possible, Nimenrix and a TT containing vaccine, such as DTaP-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine, 
should be co-administered or Nimenrix should be administered at least one month before the TT 
containing vaccine. 
A different injection site will be used for each vaccine. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, plan to become pregnant or are breast-feeding, you 
must tell your doctor before receiving Nimenrix. 
Driving and using machines 
Nimenrix is not likely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. However, do not drive or use any 
machines if you are feeling unwell. 
69 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Nimenrix contains sodium 
This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
3.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Nimenrix is and what it is used for 
What Nimenrix is and what it is used for 
Nimenrix is a vaccine which helps protect against infections caused by bacteria (germs) called 
“Neisseria meningitidis” types A, C, W-135 and Y. 
“Neisseria meningitidis" types A, C, W-135 and Y bacteria can cause serious illnesses such as: 
 
 
These infections are passed easily from person to person and can cause death if not treated. 
Nimenrix may be given to adults, adolescents, children and infants over the age of 6 weeks. 
meningitis - an infection of the tissue that lines the brain and spinal cord. 
septicaemia - an infection of the blood. 
How Nimenrix works 
Nimenrix helps your body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the bacteria. These 
antibodies help protect you against the diseases. 
Nimenrix will only protect against infections caused by the bacteria “Neisseria meningitidis” types A, 
C, W-135 and Y. 
2.  What you need to know before you receive Nimenrix 
Nimenrix should not be given if: 
 
you are allergic to the active substances or any of the other ingredients in this vaccine (listed in 
section 6). 
Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the 
face or tongue. See your doctor immediately if you notice any of these. 
If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before you receive Nimenrix. 
75 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Warnings and precautions: 
Check with your doctor or nurse before you receive this vaccine if: 
  you have an infection with a high temperature (over 38°C). If this applies to you, the 
vaccination will not be given until you are feeling better. A minor infection such as a cold 
should not be a problem. However, talk to your doctor or nurse first. 
  you have a bleeding problem or you bruise easily. 
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse before you receive 
Nimenrix. 
Nimenrix may not fully protect everyone who is vaccinated. If you have a weak immune system (such 
as due to HIV infection or medicines that affect the immune system) you may not get a full benefit 
from Nimenrix. 
Fainting can occur (mostly in adolescents) following, or even before, any needle injection. Therefore 
tell the doctor or nurse if you or your child fainted with a previous injection. 
Other medicines and Nimenrix 
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including other 
vaccines and medicines obtained without a prescription. 
Nimenrix may not work as well if you are taking medicines that affect your immune system. 
In infants, Nimenrix can be given concomitantly with combined diphtheria - tetanus - acellular 
pertussis (DTaP) vaccines, including combination DTaP vaccines with hepatitis B, inactivated 
poliovirus or Haemophilus influenzae type b (HBV, IPV or Hib) such as DTaP-HBV-IPV/Hib 
vaccine, and with 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. 
From age 1 year and above, Nimenrix can be given concomitantly with any of the following vaccines: 
hepatitis A (HAV) and hepatitis B (HBV) vaccines, measles - mumps - rubella (MMR) vaccine, 
measles - mumps - rubella - varicella (MMRV) vaccine, 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine or 
unadjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine. 
In the second year of life, Nimenrix can also be given concomitantly with combined diphtheria - 
tetanus - acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccines, including combination DTaP vaccines with hepatitis B, 
inactivated poliovirus or Haemophilus influenzae type b (HBV, IPV or Hib) such as DTaP-HBV-
IPV/Hib vaccine, and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. 
In individuals aged 9 to 25 years, Nimenrix can be given concomitantly with human papillomavirus 
vaccine [Types 16, 18] and a combined diphtheria (reduced antigen content), tetanus and acellular 
pertussis vaccine. 
Whenever possible, Nimenrix and a TT containing vaccine, such as DTaP-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine, 
should be co-administered or Nimenrix should be administered at least one month before the TT 
containing vaccine. 
A different injection site will be used for each vaccine. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, plan to become pregnant or are breast-feeding, you 
must tell your doctor before receiving Nimenrix.

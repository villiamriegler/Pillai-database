Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for dulaglutide, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Based on the review of a cumulative review provided by the Marketing Authorisation Holder and 
further analysis of EudraVigilance reports, the PRAC concluded that a causal relationship between 
dulaglutide and the adverse reactions hypersensitivity, anaphylactic reaction and angioedema cannot 
be excluded. Therefore, section 4.8 of the Summary of Product Characteristics will be updated to 
reflect these adverse reactions, with frequencies of uncommon, rare and rare, respectively. The 
Package Leaflet is updated in accordance.   
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for dulaglutide the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing dulaglutide is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

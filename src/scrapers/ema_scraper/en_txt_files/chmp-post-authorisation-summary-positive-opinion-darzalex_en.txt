EMA/CHMP/126505/2017   
Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) 
Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Darzalex 
daratumumab 
On 23 February 2017, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending changes to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
Darzalex. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Janssen-Cilag International NV. 
The CHMP adopted an extension to the existing indication as follows2: 
“Darzalex is indicated: 
• 
• 
as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, 
whose prior therapy included a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent and who have 
demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy. 
in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, or bortezomib and dexamethasone, 
for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one 
prior therapy.” 
In addition, since all specific obligations of the conditional marketing authorisation have been fulfilled, the 
marketing authorisation for Darzalex will be switched from conditional to full approval. 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of 
product characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to 
the marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission. 
1 Summaries of positive opinion are published without prejudice to the Commission decision, which will normally be issued 67 
days from adoption of the opinion

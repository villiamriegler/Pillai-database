2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) is an acute systemic febrile syndrome caused by Ebola Virus (EBOV). To date, 
six species of EBOV have been identified: Zaïre, Bundibugyo, Sudan, Taï Forest, Reston and Bombali, with 
the first four known to cause human disease. Case fatality of EVD varies with the EBOV species and 
ranges from 25% to 90% and incubation period ranges from 2 to 21 days. The disease-to-infection ratio 
is generally described as being 1:1 but some EVD asymptomatic and pauci-symptomatic infections are 
increasingly acknowledged. 
While, historically, children have represented a small number of total cases of EVD, in recent outbreaks 
up to a quarter of cases have been in children. The largest outbreak to date was in West Africa from 2013 
to 2016. This multi-country outbreak of Zaïre EBOV which included cases outside Africa resulted in 
28,616 cases, of whom approximately 18–20% were children, with a reported mortality rate of 42–63% 
in children <18 years and of 73–86% in children <5 years. 
Younger children appear to have shorter mean incubation periods than adults, with an average of 7 days 
in children younger than 1 year, 8-9 days in children 1-9 years, and 11 days in patients aged 45 years or 
older. The disease in children also tends to have a shorter time course from symptom onset to 
hospitalisation and/or death compared to adults. 
EBOV is highly contagious and spreads through human-to-human transmission directly or indirectly via 
blood or body fluids (e.g., urine, saliva, sweat, faeces, vomit, breast milk, and semen) of living or dead 
infected persons, or any soiled material. Most contacts are with close family members living in the same 
household. Vertical and sexual transmission through vaginal secretions, semen and breast milk can also 
occur as the virus can persist in these sites. The duration of persistence and the magnitude of risk of 
transmission through survivors is currently unknown. 
The pathogenesis of EVD is characterised by an intense inflammatory process, impaired haemostasis, and 
capillary leaks, with mortality resulting from septic shock and multi-organ system failure. Initial signs and 
symptoms are nonspecific (e.g., fever, headache, myalgia, fatigue) and may mimic other more common 
conditions such as malaria. After a week, haemorrhagic manifestations can appear in more than half of 
the patients. EVD progresses with gastrointestinal symptoms, internal and external bleeding, and in some 
cases, rash, and neurologic involvement. The varying spectrum of EVD severity is increasingly described.  
Claimed indication 
The MAH claims an extension of Ervebo’ s approved indication to children and adolescents from 1 to 17 
years of age for active immunisation to protect against EVD caused by Zaire EBOV. 
Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Since the initial identification of EBOV in 1976, more than 25 outbreaks of Ebola disease have been 
reported, a majority caused by Zaïre EBOV and at least 6 caused by Sudan EBOV, mainly occurring in 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/372877/2023 
Page 9/81 
 
 
 
 
 
sub-Saharan Africa, mostly in Sudan, Uganda, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Gabon. Most of these 
outbreaks have occurred in isolated rural areas, but the outbreak in Gulu in 2000 was in a semi-urban 
area of Uganda. It is conceivable that small outbreaks might not have been detected. The largest Ebola 
outbreak to date occurred from 2013 to 2016 in West Africa, predominantly affecting Guinea, Sierra 
Leone, and Liberia affecting both rural and urban areas with very high incidence and mortality (more than 
28 000 cases with more than 11 000 deaths). Due to potential under-reporting the true burden might 
have been even higher. In this outbreak, the overall mean case fatality in confirmed cases with recorded 
clinical outcomes was 62,9%. The epidemic peaked in August through October 2014. In March 2016, the 
WHO declared the end of the PHEIC. Sierra Leone was declared free of Ebola transmission in March 2016. 
After a few sporadic cases in Liberia and Guinea in March/April 2016, these two countries were also 
declared free of Ebola transmission in June 2016. 
Most recent outbreaks were declared in the Democratic Republic of Congo and were caused by Zaïre 
EBOV. Recently, on 20-Sep-2022, Uganda declared an outbreak of Ebola disease, caused by Sudan EBOV. 
Beyond the direct morbidity and mortality due to Ebola, large outbreaks of the disease have indirect 
effects on population health based on the diversion of resources from programmes aimed at controlling 
other diseases of major importance.  
EVD is not an airborne disease and only symptomatic patients are contagious. As transmission requires 
direct contact with bodily fluids, the risk of infection is considered very low if precautions are strictly 
followed. The probability that EU/EEA citizens living or travelling in EVD-affected areas will be exposed to 
the virus is low provided they adhere to recommended precautionary measures. Nosocomial transmission 
can occur. Healthcare workers can be infected through close contact with infected patients. However, 
health worker infections are preventable, and the risk for infection can be significantly reduced through 
the appropriate use of infection control precautions and adequate barrier procedures. 
The risk of EBOV spreading from an EVD patient who arrives in the EU as result of a planned medical 
evacuation is considered extremely low. If a symptomatic case of EVD presents in an EU Member State, 
secondary transmission to the family and in healthcare facilities cannot be ruled out. 
Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Aetiology 
EBOV belong to the genus Ebolavirus of the Filoviridae family in the order Mononegavirales. All members 
of this order possess a non-segmented, negative-sense RNA genome of 19 kb with seven open reading 
frames, that is encapsulated by the viral nucleoprotein (NP). The NP–RNA complex acts as the template 
for genome replication and assembles into a helical nucleocapsid (NC) along with accessory proteins. 
EBOV has a striking, filamentous structure of about 800 nm in length and 80 nm in diameter. The helical 
NC acquires an envelope by budding from the plasma membrane. The viral envelope contains spikes 
consisting of the glycoprotein (GP) trimer. This GP molecule achieves the combined functions of 
attachment to host cells, endosomal entry, and membrane fusion.  
The genus Ebolavirus includes six distinct species. Zaire, Sudan, Bundibugyo and Taï Forest EBOV occur 
in Africa and cause serious illness in humans. Reston does not cause illness in humans and Bombali has 
been identified in bats, but it is unclear if it can cause disease in humans. The first three, Bundibugyo, 
Zaire, and Sudan EBOV have been associated with large outbreaks in Africa. EBOV persists in the 
environment in a still unidentified animal reservoir, most likely the fruit bats, which maintains the virus in 
an enzootic cycle. Human infection represents a sporadic event taking place in the context of a human 
animal interface. Transmission is mainly due to the contact with blood or body fluids from infected 
humans or animals.

Pathogenesis 
The tropism of EBOV gives some clues as to pathogenic mechanisms. The major route of infection is 
through the mucosa or skin from where the virus reaches macrophages, monocytes, and dendritic cells, 
leading to spread to regional lymph nodes, liver, and spleen. Macrophages and monocytes stimulated by 
EBOV release “cytokine storm” thereby damaging tissues and blood vessels. Death occurs due to blood 
loss and/or coagulation. Coagulopathy occurs due to thrombocytopenia, loss of anticoagulant protein C, 
destruction of clotting factors, and due to the destruction of fibrin. Damage to blood vessels causes 
disseminated intravascular coagulation as well as renal failure. Antibodies developed against EBOV bind 
with the complement C1q and reach to the binding sites on dendritic cells and macrophages, leading to 
damage of these cells. Lesions related to EVD include extensive haemorrhages of the mucosa, necrosis of 
different organs like liver, kidney, testes, and ovaries. Necrotic foci with inflammatory cells can be found 
in hepatic lobules, and there may be multinucleated syncytia formation in the hepatic cells. Necrosis of 
red pulp and fibrin deposition are the characteristic lesions seen in the spleen. Splenic macrophages 
reveal big, acidophilic particles in their cytoplasm which are similar to intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies. 
Gastrointestinal tract shows mononuclear infiltration into the submucosa and lamina propria. Mild 
emphysema, oedema in the terminal alveoli, and stasis of blood can be noticed in the lung parenchyma. 
It has also been shown that macrophages in the chambers of the eye, brain, and epididymis are sites of 
viral persistence (sanctuary sites). 
Clinical presentation and diagnosis  
Clinical presentation 
Adults 
Following an incubation period of 2–21 days, EVD typically starts as a non-specific viral syndrome with 
abrupt onset. At this stage the most frequent symptoms are high fever, malaise, fatigue, and body aches. 
These symptoms usually develop after a few days into gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, 
vomiting, and diarrhoea. These manifestations can range from mild-to-severe, with body fluid loss of up 
to 5–10 L/day. Other, rarer, symptoms are cough and dyspnoea, conjunctival injection, hiccups, or 
localised pain of chest, abdomen, muscles, or joints.  
Part of the patients may recover from this stage, others however will experience deterioration of 
symptoms finally going into shock, possibly due to hypovolaemia and a systemic inflammatory response. 
Around this time, patients can present with haemorrhagic events, such as conjunctival bleeding, 
petechiae, gastrointestinal bleeding, mucosal haemorrhage. Neurological events are rare and include 
confusion, delirium, and convulsions. Cases of EVD-related encephalitis have been reported. Other late 
symptoms include dysphagia, throat pain, and oral ulcers. A maculopapular rash has been described. 
Exceptionally, sudden death can occur in recovering patients, possibly due to cardiac arrhythmias. If 
patients survive the stage of shock, gradual recovery can occur.  
Laboratory features include variable degrees of anaemia and thrombocytopenia as well as changes in 
number and type of white blood cells. Renal dysfunction (in up to 50% of case) and substantial increases 
in liver enzymes are common. Likewise, creatine phosphokinase and amylase concentrations can be 
increased. Electrolyte abnormalities are common, especially hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia, and 
hypocalcaemia. Clotting tests can indicate a varying degree of intravascular coagulation. Metabolic 
acidosis can occur, particularly in cases of shock and renal failure. 
High viral loads, combined with severe muscle breakdown and renal impairment, have consistently been 
predictive of death. Differences in severity of clinical events and outcome might exist between young

children, young adults, and older people. Pregnant women face higher mortality and risk of miscarriage 
and stillbirth. Clinical presentation can be aggravated by concurrent comorbidities and infections, such as 
malaria and bacterial sepsis. Clinical signs and symptoms have varied across the different Ebola 
outbreaks reported during the last decades.  
Children 
Clinically, many signs and symptoms of EVD in children are difficult to differentiate from other infections 
and these include fever, anorexia, weakness, diarrhoea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Based on the 
largest collection of EVD data reported to date (2014-2016 outbreak), children are more likely to present 
with constitutional and gastrointestinal symptoms as well as fever but less likely to report abdominal, 
chest, and joint pain than adults. Mortality is high (ranging from 42–63% in children <18 years), 
especially in children <5 years old (with rates of 73–86%). 
Diagnosis 
Diagnosis based on clinical symptoms can be difficult as clinical manifestations are like those of other 
infectious diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever and meningitis. Confirmation that symptoms are 
caused by EBOV infection are made using diagnostic laboratory methods: ELISA, antigen-capture 
detection tests, serum neutralization test, RT-PCR, electron microscopy, virus isolation by cell culture.  
When patients with EVD present at a hospital, typically 3–6 days after the onset of the symptoms, the 
viral load is already high and detectable in the patient’s blood by RT-PCR in most cases. Viral load peaks 
3–7 days after the onset of symptoms. In fatal cases, viraemia is usually 10–100 fold higher than in 
survivors. IgG and IgM humoral responses develop in survivors but not in all fatal cases thus, diagnosing 
of EVD using serology is only possible in a fraction of symptomatic patients and requires seroconversion 
or a substantial increase in antibody titre in paired serum samples. However, serology is the method of 
choice to diagnose asymptomatic EBOV infections characterised by extremely low viraemia and 
development of IgG and IgM about 3 weeks after infection. Another technique also used for post-mortem 
diagnosis is antigen detection by immunohistochemistry on a skin biopsy.  
During the acute phase of the disease and convalescence, viral RNA can be detected by RT-PCR in other 
body fluids, such as saliva, tears, sweat, breast milk, urine, CSF, ocular fluid, amniotic fluid, vaginal fluid, 
and seminal fluid. Viral RNA can remain detectable in these fluids after the RT-PCR on blood becomes 
negative. Irrespective of the severity of the acute disease, EBOV tends to persist, specifically in 
immunologically privileged sites (such as the eye, central nervous system, and testis) where antiviral 
immune response is less effective. Persistence is associated with clinical sequelae, disease reactivation, 
long-term virus shedding, and virus transmission. Virus found in the seminal fluid can still be infectious 
and be sexually transmitted for more than a year after disease onset. Cases of women transmitting the 
virus via breastfeeding have been reported, although the duration of infectivity by this route is unknown. 
Reports suggest that other reservoirs and other human-to-human transmission routes of persisting virus 
in humans could still be uncovered. 
Management 
Treatments 
The US FDA approved 2 monoclonal antibody therapies, REGN-EB3 (Inmazeb) and ansuvimab (Ebanga), 
for the treatment of infection caused by ZEBOV in adult and paediatric patients. REGN-EB3 is a 
combination of 3 fully human monoclonal antibodies that received approval in October 2020. The 3 
monoclonal antibodies bind simultaneously to non-overlapping epitopes on the EBOV GP yielding 
neutralising activity to prevent entry of the virus into the host cell. Ansuvimab is a human monoclonal 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/372877/2023

IgG1 antibody that received approval in December 2020. Ansuvimab blocks binding between the EBOV GP 
and host cell receptor protein in the late endosomes. 
Both REGN-EB3 and ansuvimab are administered intravenously. Results from the PALM Phase 2/3 study 
showed a lower incidence in mortality at 28 days (primary endpoint) for participants treated with REGN-
EB3 and participants treated with ansuvimab compared with participants in the control group treated with 
ZMapp, an experimental triple monoclonal antibody which had shown a favourable trend in survival in a 
previous study.  
Nonetheless, 34% and 67% of patients with higher viral loads who received ansuvimab and REGN-EB3, 
respectively, in the study died and there remains an unmet medical need for more efficacious 
interventions. 
Other vaccines 
Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo, also known as Zabdeno and Mvabea, respectively, is a 2-component vaccine 
regimen that was authorised under exceptional circumstances in the EU and prequalified by the WHO for 
the prevention of disease caused by ZEBOV in individuals 1 year of age and older. Ad26.ZEBOV is 
administered first followed by MVA-BN-Filo approximately 8 weeks later as a booster. Ad26.ZEBOV 
encodes the Zaire ebolavirus Mayinga variant GP. MVA-BN-Filo encodes 4 filovirus antigens, namely GP 
from Zaire ebolavirus Mayinga variant, GP from Sudan ebolavirus Gulu variant, GP from Marburgvirus 
Musoke variant, and the Nucleoprotein from Taï Forest ebolavirus. Clinical studies demonstrated that 
Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo is safe and elicits strong neutralising and non-neutralising antibody responses. 
In the paediatric population vaccinated with Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo, EBOV GP-specific binding 
antibody responses were tested in respectively 123 children aged 1-3 years (study EBL3001), 182 
children aged 4-11 years (52 in study EBL2002 and 130 in study EBL3001), and in 195 adolescents aged 
12-17 years (53 in study EBL2002 and 142 in study EBL3001). However, protective efficacy against EVD 
in humans has not been demonstrated. Also, the need for more than 1 dose and the length of time 
between doses make this vaccine regimen less suitable for an outbreak response in which immediate 
protection is necessary. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Ervebo vaccine (hereinafter also referred to as V920) is a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) 
which has the gene encoding for the VSV glycoprotein G deleted from its RNA and replaced with the gene 
encoding for the ZEBOV (Kikwit strain) glycoprotein (rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP). The vaccine is a genetically 
engineered, replication-competent, attenuated live vaccine that induces immune responses after a single 
dose.  
The relative contributions of innate, humoral and cell-mediated immune responses to protection from 
ZEBOV are unknown. 
The pharmacotherapeutic group (ATC Code) is viral vaccines (J07BX02). 
The vaccine is manufactured in serum-free Vero cell cultures. The virus is harvested from the cell culture 
medium, purified, and frozen to produce the Bulk Drug Substance (BDS). The vaccine Drug Product is a 
solution for injection manufactured by aseptic addition of the BDS to the Drug Product Stabilizer Solution, 
which contains 2.5 mg/mL rice derived recombinant human serum albumin (rHSA) and 10 mM Tris buffer. 
This vaccine contains a trace amount of rice protein. The vaccine must be transported and stored frozen 
at -80°C to -60ºC. 
The vaccine is currently approved for active immunisation of individuals 18 years of age or older to 
protect against EVD caused by ZEBOV. The MAH is claiming an extension of indication to include the 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/372877/2023

paediatric population from 1 year to less than 18 years of age. The proposed posology in children is the 
same as in adults, 1 mL of ≥72 million plaque forming units (pfu) administered as a solution for injection 
through intramuscular administration. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The EMA decision (P/0095/2017) regarding the agreement of a PIP, the granting of a deferral, and the 
granting of a waiver for rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP (EMEA-001786-PIP01-15) in accordance with Regulation (EC) 
No 1901/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council was adopted in April 2017. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The MAH claimed that the clinical studies were conducted in a manner commensurate with the principles 
of Good Clinical Practice including Independent Ethics Committee review, informed consent, and the 
protection of human subjects participating in biomedical research. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No new non-clinical studies have been conducted since 2019 that would change or impact the ERA. Two 
clinical trials were completed since ERA approval:  
Study V920-016 
This clinical study (also known as PREVAC) submitted to support this extension of indication application 
was designed and initiated by external partners in 2017 following the 2014 to 2016 outbreak in West 
Africa.  
Shedding, but not viremia, was assessed in saliva samples from a subset of 60 children in V920-016 
(refer to Clinical Safety section for more information about the estimate proportion of children with 
detectable V920 virus in saliva and quantification of V920 shed in saliva by children after each 
vaccination). 
Study V920-018 
This was an open-label trial implemented as Part B of the Phase 3 ring vaccination trial for V920 (Part A, 
V920-010) that was conducted in Guinea during the 2014 to 2016 Ebola outbreak. The purpose of this 
trial was to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of V920 in vaccinated frontline workers 18 years of 
age and older. Safety was assessed for all vaccinated subjects from Days 1 through 85 postvaccination 
and a subset of subjects from Days 1 through 180 postvaccination. 
Shedding and viremia were not assessed in V920-018. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/372877/2023 
Page 14/81 
 
 
 
 
 
2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
From these studies, the MAH concluded that shedding would not contribute to the environmental spread 
of V920, and therefore, risk to humans and the environment from exposure to the vaccine is expected to 
be negligible.  
The MAH’s statement on environmental spread cannot be supported as the high-level description of data 
obtained with study V920-016 indicate that shedding is occurring. Therefore, the dissemination of V920 in 
the human population from the vaccinees cannot be ruled out.  
Risk management measures as described in the label should further limit exposure to V920 to the full 
extent possible. As a precaution vaccinees should attempt to avoid exposure of livestock to blood and 
bodily fluids for at least 6 weeks following vaccination to avoid the theoretical risk of spread of the 
rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine virus. Individuals who develop vesicular rash after receiving the vaccine 
should cover the vesicles until they heal. These recommendations have not changed based on results of 
V920-016. 
It is also important to consider that shedding of V920 does not necessarily involve a risk. Shedding is a 
mechanism by which adverse effects for close contacts or the environment may occur depending on the 
stability of shed viral particles under environmental conditions outside the host, the route of transmission 
(e.g., spreading through aerosols, fecal-oral route of transmission via direct contact or contaminated 
fluids, vector-borne transmission, through parenteral exposure), the capacity to infect cells of other 
persons or animals and, as a last element in the chain of events for environmental risk to occur, the 
pathogenicity of the vaccine virus in the novel host organism (see Clinical Safety section for more 
information). 
The MAH improved the ERA addendum by providing more detailed information and implemented 
additional clarifications to have a critical appraisal of the viral shedding results and modified relevant 
sections in the SmPC with clear instructions for parents and caregivers caring for recent young vaccinees. 
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus - Zaire ebolavirus vaccine (live).  
Considering the above data, recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus - Zaire ebolavirus vaccine (live) 
should be used according to the precautions stated in the SmPC to minimise any potential risks to the 
environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/372877/2023 
Page 15/81 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 1: Tabular overview of clinical studies (V920-016 Protocol version 4.0) 
A single phase 2 clinical trial V920-016 (PREVAC) was included in the application in support to the 
extension of indication to the paediatric population. No efficacy study was conducted in the new targeted 
population. Enrollment in the V920-016 study included V920 and Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo vaccine arms 
with matched placebos.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Since the V920 vaccine contains a genetically modified organism, assessment of the risks to human 
health and to the environment was required. The main characteristics of the in vivo behaviour of the live 
V920 vaccine were previously evaluated through the assessment of vaccine viremia and shedding in 
adults at the initial marketing authorisation application.   
Viral shedding/secondary transmission to close contacts, particularly immunocompromised hosts is listed 
as an important potential risk in the RMP to be addressed in the clinical studies V920-015 and V920-016 
as an additional pharmacovigilance activity. 
Another clinical study (EBOLAPED - NCT05130398) that aims to assess the clinical significance of 
shedding of rVSV RNA following vaccination with the V920 in children is also ongoing in Gabon.  
In the V920-016 study, shedding in saliva of V920 was evaluated in a single-site (Redemption Hospital, 
Liberia) substudy to estimate the proportion of children with detectable V920 virus in saliva by qRT-PCR 
and to quantify V920 shed in saliva by children after each vaccination. 
Vaccine shedding was assessed using a qRT-PCR developed to specifically detect and quantitate the 
rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP in human urine, plasma, swabs, skin, and synovial fluid. The assay primer set and 
probes target the junction of the VSV and ZEBOV-GP sequences in the vaccine such that this assay was 
specific for the V920 vaccine and did not detect wild-type VSV or ZEBOV. The assay consisted of 
extraction of RNA from clinical specimens using the Roche MagNa Pure 96 total nucleic acid isolation kit; 
one-step reverse transcription of mRNA to complementary DNA followed by amplification and detection of 
rVSVΔG-ZEBOV on the ABI QuantStudio 6. Results were reported as copies/mL using an external 
standard curve of rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP calibrators. To verify RNA extraction from the specimen and 
successful RT-PCR amplification, an internal control (MS2 RNA phage) was spiked into each sample prior 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/372877/2023

to RNA extraction and was amplified in parallel with the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP target with each specimen for 
the entire assay procedure. The saliva matrix is currently being qualified in support of V920-016. 
The sample size and results of the saliva shedding substudy are addressed in Clinical Safety section. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Humoral immune responses induced by V920 in adults and children were investigated in the V920-016 
study. Cell mediated immune responses were investigated in a single site substudy (only in adults) and 
results of this substudy were not submitted by the MAH. Please refer to the Clinical Immunogenicity 
section for further details on immunogenicity assessment. 
Mechanism of action 
V920 consists of a live, attenuated recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus-based vector expressing the 
envelope glycoprotein gene of Zaire Ebola virus (rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP). Protective immunity against EBOV 
is not well understood. EBOV GP is the major antigen in the vaccine and has been shown to induce virus-
neutralising antibodies as well as non-neutralising antibodies. 
There is currently no established immunological correlate of protection against ZEBOV. The relative 
contributions of innate, humoral and cell-mediated immunity to protection from ZEBOV are unknown. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
At the time of marketing authorisation, V920 shedding was observed in urine and saliva samples 
(respectively from Day 1 through Day 7 in urine and from Day 1 through Day 14 in saliva). V920 
shedding was detected in a higher proportion of school-age children and adolescents (n=39, V920-007 
study) compared to adults in general (all studies). At Day 7, V920 RNA was detectable in saliva in 35% of 
school-age children and in 88% of adolescents, and in a urine sample from 1 school-age child. Although, 
shedding in urine could have been investigated for better characterisation, evaluation of shedding only in 
saliva sample is deemed acceptable, as being the more relevant one based on the limited data available. 
A limitation of this shedding substudy is that it did not include vaccinated adults. Including also the adult 
population would have allowed to compare proportions of shedding and levels of detected vaccine virus in 
paediatric and adult populations in a single study, with the same qualified analytical methods. 
The qRT-PCR method used for the shedding substudy is comparable to the one applied at time of 
marketing authorisation and deemed acceptable. The MAH provided the LLOD and LLOQ values of the 
qualified assay to detect and measure rVSV∆G-ZEBOV-GP vaccine virus in human saliva specimens, which 
are respectively 100 copies/mL and 200 copies/mL.  
As already discussed at the time of marketing authorisation, qRT-PCR cannot distinguish between live 
virus/vector and degraded virus/vector. It therefore remains difficult to define the risks associated to 
shedding based on qRT-PCR results. 
The selected saliva sampling time-points after the first vaccination are considered acceptable, additional 
time-points should have been tested after the second vaccination to exclude delayed shedding in the 
participants randomised to 2 doses of V920.  
The data submitted (proportion of tested participants with shedding > 0 and quantitative data submitted 
in this second round) are summarized and assessed in the Clinical Safety section.  
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/372877/2023 
Page 17/81 
 
 
 
 
 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The characteristics of the in vivo behaviour of the live V920 vaccine were evaluated in children and 
adolescents through the assessment of vaccine shedding in a single site substudy (refer to the Clinical 
Safety section for further details).  
Humoral immune responses induced by V920 in adults and children were investigated in the V920-016 
study. Cell mediated immune responses were investigated in a single site substudy (only in adults) and 
results of this substudy were not submitted by the MAH. There are no established immunological 
correlates of protection (ICP) against EVD (refer to the Clinical Immunogenicity for further details).  
2.4.  Clinical immunogenicity 
2.4.1.  Dose response studies 
No dose response studies were conducted in the paediatric population to support the requested extension 
of the approved therapeutic indication of Ervebo to include the paediatric population aged ≥1 year. 
2.4.2.  Main study – PREVAC (V920-016) 
The study was designed to evaluate immunogenicity and safety in healthy children and adolescents from 
1 to 17 years of age and adults 18 years of age and older.  
The three vaccine strategies studied were: 
• 
• 
• 
a single dose of V920 (i.e., approved regimen for active immunisation in individuals ≥18 year of 
age) 
two doses of V920 administered with 56 days interval 
the 2-dose heterologous vaccination regimen Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo administered with 56 
days interval (i.e., approved regimen for active immunisation in individuals ≥1 year of age) 
A single site substudy was also conducted to estimate the proportion of children who shed vaccine virus in 
saliva after each vaccination. 
The base study for V920-016 was a 12-month period after randomisation (first vaccination) for the 
assessment of primary and secondary safety and immunogenicity objectives. Enrolment and 12-month 
safety follow-up in the base study were complete. The CSR summarizes results from the base study. No 
data for participants who received Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo were submitted. 
All participants will be followed-up annually through 60 months (ongoing as per protocol version 5.0) to 
evaluate the durability of immune response and SAE.  
Methods 
Trial design 
The original study protocol (version 1.0, 8-Oct-2016) was amended four times. In the initial study design, 
a total of 4,900 participants (3,500 adults and 1,400 children) were to be randomly allocated to one of 
the three vaccine strategies or placebo. The study size was powered to assess immune responses and 
safety outcomes separately in adults and children. However, protocol version 1.0 was never implemented, 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/372877/2023 
Page 18/81 
 
 
 
 
 
as the protocol was amended to begin the study with randomisation to the Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo or 
matching placebo arm only (protocol version 2.0, 27-Feb-2017).  
Under amended protocol version 3.0 (5-May-2017), randomisation to the two different V920 arms and 
V920-matching placebo was open. As the release potency of the V920 lot was higher, the sponsors 
decided to proceed with enrolment using a dilution of V920. Therefore, participants in the 1-dose V920 
group and 2-dose V920 group were administered 1.0 mL of 2-fold diluted V920 corresponding to a 
potency level of approximately 5.0E7 pfu/mL. Enrolment of children was staged by age group. Children 
from 12 to 17 years of age were enrolled first (along with participants ≥18 years of age) and upon review 
of safety data and agreement by the DSMB, children 5 to 11 years of age were enrolled. Children 1 to 4 
years of age were enrolled after review of prior safety in the older 2 age groups and agreement by the 
DSMB. No changes were made to the data collection plan. 
Based on the safety experience with 2-fold diluted V920 considered acceptable by the DSMB for the 
children enrolled under protocol version 3.0 in the 3 age subgroups (1–4, 5–11, and 12–17 years), the 
protocol was amended to version 4.0 (15-Mar-2018):  
• 
• 
• 
• 
The dose of V920 was changed from the diluted dose level to the licensed dose of V920 (1.3E8 
pfu/mL, with the geometric mean of available assay results of 9.4E7 pfu/mL). 
The target adult enrolment was reduced from 3,500 to 1,400. 
The target sample size for the saliva substudy was changed to 140 children (protocol versions 3.0 
and 4.0) with approximately equal distribution of children in each of the 3 child age groups. 
The protocol and SAP were amended to state that the primary objectives would be accomplished 
with participants enrolled under version 4.0. Participants enrolled under version 3.0 would provide 
information on the safety and immunogenicity of diluted V920 compared with placebo for adults 
and children in each of the three age groups. 
Figure 1: PREVAC study design – Protocol version 4.0 
Finally, the protocol was amended (version 5.0, 3-Oct-2019) to add a long-term follow-up period 
consisting of annual visits for an additional 4 years after the Month 12 visit, which was instituted for all

participants. The secondary and exploratory objectives were updated accordingly. Data from this long-
term follow-up period are not included in the CSR and will be summarised in a future report.

•  GP-EBOV antibody response at Day 28, Month 3, and Month 12 after randomisation (first 
vaccination) as measured by GP-ELISA 
•  Neutralizing antibody response at Day 28, Month 3, and Month 12 after randomisation (first 
vaccination), as measured by PRNT 
•  SAEs, including death, occurring through Month 12 
• 
• 
Injection-site reactions and targeted symptoms of any grade severity and Grade 3 or 4 unsolicited 
AEs after first vaccination and through 7, 14, and 28 days after first vaccination 
Injection-site reactions and targeted symptoms of any grade severity and Grade 3 or 4 unsolicited 
AEs after second vaccination, through 7 days after second vaccination (63 days after first 
vaccination), and through approximately 28 to 35 days after second vaccination (Month 3 after 
first vaccination). 
Other secondary safety endpoints: 
•  Maximum intensity of injection-site reactions and targeted symptoms 
•  Vaccine-related AEs 
•  Changes in vital signs (e.g., temperature) 
•  Changes in body measurements (in children only) 
•  Clinically significant changes from baseline in biochemical markers and CBC measurements (in 
children only) 
•  Shedding in saliva of rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP recombinant virus through Month 3 (in a subsample of 
children). 
Immunogenicity assessment 
Blood sampling in adults and children for immunogenicity testing and future research were planned at 
baseline, at Day 7, 14, 28, 56, 63, and at Months 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60. 
Immunogenicity data was obtained using validated GP-ELISA and PRNT for specimens sampled at 
baseline, Day 28, Month 3, and Month 12 after randomisation (initial vaccination) in subjects that 
received one dose of V920, two doses of V920, or 1.0 mL placebo. Validated immunogenicity data were 
not obtained for the 0.5 mL placebo. 
Serum samples were gamma irradiated to inactivate EBOV that may have been present before they were 
tested at laboratory. Gamma irradiation has been shown to result in an approximately 20% elevation in 
measured antibody response for negative clinical specimens and an approximately 20% reduction in 
postvaccination antibody response (1.21-fold decrease [95% CI = 1.15, 1.27
fold]) in the GP
ELISA. The 
effect of gamma irradiation on PRNT showed a similar reduction in postvaccination PRNT (1.19-fold 
‑
‑
decrease [95% CI = 1.06, 1.34-fold decrease]) without the elevation in measured antibody response for 
negative clinical samples. The effect of gamma-irradiation was discussed during the initial MAA 
procedure: “elevation in baseline and reduction in post-vaccination concentrations measured by GP ELISA 
(EU/ml) as a consequence of gamma-irradiation might result in a reduced estimation of the percentage of 
subjects achieving a 4-fold rise in response to vaccination”.

GP-ELISA testing was conducted on all samples, whereas PRNT testing was conducted on samples from a 
randomly selected 50% subgroup of participants.  
ZEBOV Anti-GP IgG Human ELISA 
To measure and quantify total IgG antibodies against V920, an indirect ELISA which utilizes a purified 
recombinant Ebola Zaire glycoprotein (rGP) as the coating antigen was validated. Briefly, microtiter plates 
are coated with purified recombinant ZEBOV-rGP. Serum samples and controls are then incubated with 
the rGP coated wells allowing ZEBOV-GP specific antibodies to bind. A serial diluted reference standard, 
obtained from a pool of vaccinated human donors is also included. Each well is then incubated with goat 
anti-human IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate, which enzymatically reacts with the 
tetramethylbenzidine substrate to form a coloured solution. After incubation, the enzymatic reaction is 
stopped using a sulfuric acid solution. The optical density (OD) is measured on an ELISA plate reader and 
serum sample titer concentrations are calculated from the standard curve using a 4-parameter logistic 
(4PL) curve fit. Titers are reported as ELISA units/mL (EU/mL). The assay was qualified and validated, 
and assessed at initial MAA and deemed acceptable.   
One half of LLOQ was used when a sample result was below LLOQ (36.11 EU/mL). 
rVSVΔG -ZEBOV-GP PRNT60 
A PRNT60 was validated to determine the neutralizing antibody levels in human sera following the 
administration of V920. In this assay, serum was diluted from 1:5 to 1:10240 and mixed with an equal 
volume of diluted V920 for final dilutions of 1:10 to 1:20480. Neutralization is allowed to proceed over an 
18-hour period at 2-8ºC after which the serum/virus mixture is used to inoculate Vero cells monolayers. 
Viral adsorption is done at 37±2ºC for 60 minutes followed by a methylcellulose overlay. The infected 
cells are incubated at 37±2ºC for 2 days. Plaques are visualized by crystal violet stain and are counted 
using the ViruSpot. Determination of the PRNT60 was based upon the percent reduction in viral plaques in 
the presence of serum compared to that of the virus control without serum. The PRNT60 assay was 
qualified and validated, and assessed concluding that the assay was suitable for its intended use.   
One half of LLOQ was used when a sample result was below LLOQ (PRNT60 35). 
Sample size 
In the protocol version 1.0, sample size was established to provide power to compare safety and 
immunogenicity separately for adults (N=3,500) and children (N=1,400). Among these participants, 
1,000 adults and 400 children were to be respectively randomised to the V920 (1 dose) or the 
Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo interventions; and 500 adults and 200 children were to be respectively 
randomised to the V920 (2 dose) or placebo (0.5 mL) or placebo (1.0 mL) interventions.  
The minimum number of paediatric subjects was approximately 1,000 based on a conservative projection 
of approximately 20% unevaluable data (e.g., dropout, missing samples, etc.) in studies conducted by 
sponsors other than the MAH. 
The planned sample size was greater than what required to address the primary objectives and in order 
to permit the exploration of subgroups and preserve power in the event there were more participants with 
elevated antibodies at baseline than anticipated. 
In protocol version 4.0, sample size was modified for the adult population from N=3,500 to N=1,400. The 
planned size for the paediatric population was not modified. The power was maintained. The multiplicity 
adjusted power for the primary hypotheses is at least 96% (0.99*0.99*0.99*0.99). For safety, the 
sample sizes allow at least 99% power to detect a 4% difference between V920 and placebo (5% vs 1%). 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/372877/2023 
Page 24/81 
 
 
 
 
 
For the saliva shedding substudy, the planned sample-size was of approximately 140 children in each of 
versions 3.0 and 4.0 (280 in total). For both versions, efforts were to be made to enrol 1/3 of the total 
number of children in each age group (i.e., 1-4, 5-11, and 12-17 years). 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Randomisation for V920 followed a 1:2:1:1 ratio (Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo matching placebo (0.5 mL): 
V920 (1-dose): V920 (2 dose): V920 matching placebo (1.0 mL)) under protocol version 3.0 and 4.0. 
Syringes were pre-labelled with a unique SID number according to a centrally prepared randomisation 
schedule. The tear-off label also included a bar code identifier. For each vaccination centre, the 
randomisation schedule was prepared using block randomisation to ensure the desired allocation ratio for 
the five arms of the study for each vaccination centre.  
The person administering the vaccination could be able to differentiate syringes by the fill volume, which 
was respectively 1.0 mL for V920 and matching placebo or 0.5 mL for Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo and 
matching placebo. However, vaccinators could not be aware whether the assignment was to active 
vaccine or placebo. 
At the time of vaccination, a tear-off label on the syringe that included the SID was to be attached to the 
baseline CRF. This was the primary link used between the vaccine administered and the PID, and PIDs 
associated with SIDs were to be available to the pharmacy. The syringe used at 56 days was to be 
labelled with the volunteer’s PID. 
With this approach, randomisation did not occur until the participant was vaccinated with the prime 
vaccine. 
Study participants and clinical staff assessing the study participants for safety and laboratory outcomes 
had to be fully blinded until all participants completed 12 months of follow-up. The laboratories carrying 
out the safety and immunogenicity analyses were to be blinded to the vaccine assignment.  
The study was unblinded after 12-month follow-up visits were completed for all participants.  
Statistical methods 
Analysis populations 
- Per-Protocol population (PP) was used as the primary population for the analysis of immunogenicity 
data in this study. The PP population consisted of all randomised and vaccinated subjects who meet the 
inclusion criteria, did not meet exclusion criteria, and did not have major protocol deviations. Subjects 
who were seronegative (baseline ELISA <200 EU/mL) and seropositive (baseline ELISA ≥200 EU/mL) 
were included in the PP population. 
- Full Analysis Set (FAS) was the secondary population for the analysis of immunogenicity data in this 
study. The FAS population consisted of all randomised and vaccinated subjects with serology data 
according to the treatment they actually received. The FAS was used if the difference in the number of 
subjects between the PP and FAS was ≥10%.  
PRNT testing was only done on a 50% randomised subgroup of samples (N=approximately 1214). The 
subgroup had to consist of 100% samples from children aged 1-17. The remainder had to consist of a 
random sample of adults. Adjustments to this strategy were made to accommodate actual enrolment and 
ensure approximately 300 adult samples. To perform the PRNT selection, after enrolment completed, the 
study sponsor provided the MAH a blinded allocation list of all V920 and 1 mL placebo subjects. Additional 
variables included protocol amendment version 3.0 or 4.0, age, and number of aliquots at baseline. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/372877/2023 
Page 25/81 
 
 
 
 
 
- All Subjects as Treated (ASaT) was used for the analysis of safety data in this study. The ASaT 
population consisted of all randomised subjects who received at least one dose of study vaccination and 
had follow-up of least one timepoint. 
Subjects who did not receive 1 of the 5 treatments were excluded from all analyses. 
Statistical methods for key immunogenicity analyses 
Analysis of antibody titers for the primary and secondary hypotheses were conducted by log-transforming 
the data, performing analysis of variance (ANOVA) on the log-transformed data, model, and un-
transforming the statistics. The ANOVA model included treatment group as a covariate. 
For multiplicity, a fixed sequence test was used to test the 5 immunogenicity hypotheses to control the 
overall type 1 error rate at a 1-sided α=0.025. 
The following immunogenicity summaries were provided: 
•  Means and 95% CIs of the GMT and GMFI from baseline 
•  Counts, percentages, and 95% CIs of the proportion of subjects who achieve a: 
-  Seroresponse at any time during study and for each timepoint defined as: 
o  ELISA: Primary: ≥2-fold increase from baseline and ≥200 EU/mL; Secondary: ≥4-fold 
increase from baseline 
o  PRNT: ≥4-fold increase from baseline 
GMT and GMFI summaries were based on ANOVA on log-transformed data and exponentiating the 
summary statistics. The ANOVA model included treatment group as a covariate. 
Seroresponse summaries were based on frequencies and exact 95% CIs. The V920 groups were 
summarised separately and pooled. 
The estimate of the percent difference for the 2 definitions of ELISA seroresponse between adults and 
children at Day 28 with the associated Miettinen and Nurminen 95% CI had to be provided. 
Formal superiority and non-inferiority hypotheses were tested for children, and for children compared to 
adults, for key primary and secondary objectives. For the superiority objectives, rejecting the null 
hypothesis required the lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI of the GP-ELISA V920 / Placebo GMT ratio 
to be greater than 1. 
For the NI primary objective, rejecting the null hypothesis required that the lower bound (LB) of the 95% 
CI for the ratio of the GMT in children 1 to 17 years of age / GMT in adults was greater than 0.5 for the 
antibody response (GP-ELISA GMT) on Day 28 after randomisation (initial vaccination). For the NI 
secondary objectives, the LB of the 95% CI for the NI hypotheses had to be greater than 0.67. 
Formal superiority and non-inferiority hypotheses are considered appropriate.

Demographic and baseline characteristics, subgroup analyses and effect of baseline factors 
Demographic variables (e.g., age, sex, race/ethnicity, protocol version), baseline characteristics, and 
prior and concomitant therapies/vaccinations were summarized by treatment either by descriptive 
statistics or categorical tables.

Subgroup included age, gender, HIV status, baseline seronegativity and seropositivity (baseline ELISA 
<200 EU/mL and baseline ELISA ≥200 EU/mL) and protocol version. The age groups were defined <3, 3 
to 11, 12 to 17 and adults. 
Subgroup analyses for protocol version 3.0 versus 4.0 could be done for selected analyses. All 
immunogenicity endpoints were summarised by subgroups. 
Results 
Participant flow 
The study results focused on the protocol version 4.0 population (licensed dose of V920). Analysis tables 
for the protocol version 3.0 population and the combined protocol version 3.0 and 4.0 population were 
also presented in the CSR. 
A total of 3,036 participants were randomised to the V920 and placebo groups across 6 study sites in 4 
countries.  
Under protocol version 4.0, a total of 2,002 participants (998 children, 1,004 adults) were randomised to 
the V920 and placebo groups and 1,919 participants (95.9%) received both vaccinations to which they 
were randomised and completed the study. A majority of participants was recruited in Guinea 
(approximately 35% equally distributed between the two sites), 25% were recruited in Sierra Leone, 22% 
in Mali (equally distributed between the two sites) and 17% recruited in Liberia. A total of 1,551 
participants were included in the PP Immunogenicity Population for GP-ELISA and a total of 821 
participants were included in the PP Immunogenicity Population for PRNT.  
Among the 998 children, 40.8% (n=407) were randomised to V920 (1 dose), 20.2% (n=202) were 
randomised to V920 (2 dose), 39.0% (n=389) were randomised to placebo (0.5 and 1.0 mL), and 96.6% 
(n=964) completed the study. 
Among the 1,004 adults, 39.34% (n=395) were randomised to V920 (1 dose), 19.62% (n=197) were 
randomised to V920 (2 dose), 41.04% (n=412) were randomised to placebo (0.5 and 1.0 mL), and 
95.1% (n=955) completed the study. 
Among the paediatric participants contributing to the primary GP-ELISA analysis and vaccinated with 1 
dose of V920, 52 were aged 1 to <3 years of age, 203 were aged 3 to <12, and 131 were aged 12 to 
<18. For the primary PRNT analysis, numbers of participants randomised to 1 dose V920 were 
respectively 40, 140 and 130 in the 3 age sub-categories. In addition, among children aged 1 to <3 
years, there were respectively 22/52 aged 1 to <2 years and 30/52 aged 2 to <3 years contributing to 
GP-ELISA analysis and respectively 19/40 aged 1 to <2 years and 21/40 aged 2 to <3 years contributing 
to PRNT analysis.

Figure 2: V920-016 Participant disposition (Protocol version 4.0) 
Under Protocol version 3.0, a total of 1,034 participants (559 children, 475 adults) were randomised to 
the V920 and placebo groups and 1,021 participants (98.7%) received both vaccinations to which they 
were randomised and 1,001 (96.8%) completed the study. A majority of approximately 75% of 
participants were recruited in Guinea (equally distributed between the two sites). The MAH specified that 
eligibility for enrolment was assessed on a first-come, first-serve basis. Among the randomised paediatric 
participants, a total of 18 were aged 1 to >3 years, 246 were aged 3 to <12 years and 295 were aged 12 
to <18 years.

The category of “other deviation” included such deviations as the use of the wrong sampling kit (i.e., 
mixing up a minor child and adult sampling kit), the collection of an additional blood sample, failure to 
collect a sample (e.g., saliva), or insufficient blood volume collection, a missing laboratory test result, an 
abnormal test result that was not transmitted by the laboratory to the investigator, a failure to retest a 
Grade 3 laboratory test result, or use of the wrong normal range, an out-of-window visit, the 
administering of the wrong second vaccination, etc.

Conduct of the study 
Major amendments made to the protocol 
The initial study protocol (version 1.0) was amended four times and the main changes are summarised in 
the Trial Design and Statistical Methods sections. 
Post-hoc analyses 
Since the dates of collection of a substantial number of samples were outside of the prespecified day 
ranges for the immunogenicity analyses in the SAP, post hoc analyses that removed restrictions for the 
prespecified day ranges at each immunogenicity analysis time point were conducted for key primary and 
secondary immunogenicity analyses for both GP-ELISA and PRNT. 
Protocol compliance and GCP inspection findings 
According to the MAH, investigative study sites were monitored to assess compliance with the study 
protocol and with GCP. Study data were reviewed for accuracy, completeness, and consistency and 
verified versus source documentation according to study SOPs and the Monitoring Plan. 
An audit was conducted by a third party at 2 sites: site 102 in Guinea and site 304 in Sierra Leone. 
During the credential verification process at site 102, it was discovered that an investigator falsified 
her/his diploma. This investigator oversaw the signing of 35 ICFs, carried out 6 medical consultations, 
reported approximately 10 targeted symptoms, and oversaw 376 follow-up visits. A CAPA plan was 
implemented to manage impact and validate study activities, including the verification of the reconsents 
and other corrective actions performed at an on-site monitoring visit. Following the on-site monitoring 
visit, 1 of 35 consents was missing. The affected participant’s data was not transferred from the sponsor 
to the MAH and was therefore excluded from all the analyses of the CSR. 
Baseline data 
Subject Characteristics 
Under protocol version 4.0, a total of 2,002 participants (998 children, 1,004 adults) were randomised to 
the V920 (1 dose), V920 (2 dose), placebo (0.5 mL) and placebo (1.0 mL) interventions. 
Among the 998 randomised children, 54.7% were male (n=546) and 45.3% were female (n=452), all 
were HIV negative. Median age was 8.0 years (range: 1 to 17 years), with 15.5% (n=155) aged 1 to <3 
years, 51.6% (n=515) aged 3 to <12 years, and 32.9% (n=328) aged 12 to <18 years.

Under Protocol Version 4.0, participants <3 years of age were 88 males and 67 females (participants 1 to 
<2 years of age were 34 males and 30 females and participants ≥2 to <3 years of age were 54 males 
and 37 females), participants 3 to 11 years of age were 264 males and 251 females and participants 12 
to 17 years of age were 194 males and 134 females.  
Only a total of 155 children aged 1-3 years were enrolled under protocol version 4.0, with 56 randomised 
to the V920 (1 dose) intervention and 60 randomised to placebo (0.5 and 1.0 mL). The additional 39 
children aged 1 to <3 years randomised to the V920 (2 dose) under protocol version 4.0 only contributed 
to the Day 28 objectives/endpoints and cannot support immunogenicity and safety assessment at Month 
12 for this extension of indication application.  
Overall, the following numbers of participants aged ≥1 to <3 years were randomised in the APaT 
population: 
- Protocol Version 4.0: 64 randomised participants from 1 to <2 years of age (referred to as aged 1 year) 
and 91 participants from ≥2 to <3 years of age (referred to as aged 2 years). Among those aged 1 to <2 
years, 25 were allocated to V920 (1 Dose), 16 to V920 2 Dose and 23 to placebo. Among those aged ≥2 
to <3 years, 33 were allocated to V920 (1 Dose), 21 to V920 2 Dose and 37 to placebo. 
- Protocol Version 3.0: 8 randomised participants from 1 to <2 years of age and 10 participants from ≥2 
to <3 years of age. Among those aged 1 to <2 years, 2 were allocated to V920 (1 Dose), 2 to V920 2 
Dose and 4 to placebo. Among those aged ≥2 to <3 years, 6 were allocated to V920 (1 Dose), none to 
V920 2 Dose and 4 to placebo.  
Among the 1,004 randomised adults, 54.6% were male (n=548) and 45.4% were female (n=456) and 
1.9% were HIV positive. Median age was 27.0 years (range: 18 to 76 years); with 98.2% (n=986) of 
adults between the ages of 18 and 65 years and only 1.8% (n=18) adults older than 65 years. 
Table 7: Participant characteristics (All randomised participants – Protocol version 4.0 – Adults)  
Under protocol version 3.0, a total of 1034 participants (559 children, 475 adults) were randomised to the 
V920 (1 dose), V920 (2 dose), placebo (0.5 mL) and placebo (1.0 mL) interventions. Among these 53% 
were male (n=549) and 47% were female (n=485) 
Paediatric participants <3 years of age were 7 males and 11 females (participants 1 to <2 years of age 
were 3 males and 5 female, participants ≥2 to <3 years of age were 4 males and 6 females), participants 
3 to 11 years of age were 134 males and 112 females, and participants 12 to 17 years of age were 145

Baseline serology  
Of the 1,551 participants in the GP-ELISA PP population of protocol version 4.0:  
•  321 (20.7%) were seropositive for GP-ELISA (defined as ≥200 EU/mL) at baseline 
•  1,087 (70.1%) were seronegative for GP-ELISA (defined as <200 EU/mL) 
•  143 (9.2%) had missing or unevaluable baseline serology samples/results.  
Numbers analysed 
Immunogenicity data for the V920 (1 dose), V920 (2 dose) and 1.0-mL placebo groups were obtained 
from samples tested in the validated GP-ELISA and PRNT at the central laboratory. Participants 
randomised to the 0.5 mL placebo were not included in the GP-ELISA PP Immunogenicity Population (but 
both 0.5 mL and 1.0 mL placebo arms were included in the safety endpoints). 
GP-ELISA testing was conducted on all samples and overall, 1,551 out of 1,602 (96.8%) participants 
contributed to these analyses for the PP population of protocol version 4.0.

PRNT testing was conducted on samples from 631 children and on samples from 190 adult under protocol 
version 4.0. These numbers correspond to 63.2% of the children and 18.9% of the adults randomised to 
V920 or 1.0-mL placebo under protocol version 4.0. Overall, 731 participants had no serology data 
available for the PRNT analyses.

Table 10: Participant accounting for the PRNT in the Per-Protocol immunogenicity population by 
vaccination group (All randomised or enrolled participants – Protocol version 4.0) 
Children accounting for the GP-ELISA or PRNT in the Per-Protocol Immunogenicity Population by 
vaccination group (Protocol version 4.0):  
- 1 to <2 years of age: 48 were included in GP-ELISA and 38 in PRNT. Among these, for GP ELISA, 22 
were treated with V920 (1 Dose), 14 with V920 (2 Doses) and 12 with placebo. For PRNT, 19 were 
treated with V920 (1 Dose), 9 with V920 (2 Doses) and 10 with placebo. 
- ≥2 to <3 years of age: 67 were included in GP-ELISA and 49 in PRNT. Among these, for GP ELISA, 30 
were treated with V920 (1 Dose), 20 with V920 (2 Doses) and 17 with placebo. For PRNT, 21 were 
treated with V920 (1 Dose), 16 with V920 (2 Doses) and 12 with placebo. 
- 3 to 11 years of age: 413 were included in GP-ELISA and 290 in PRNT. Among these, for GP ELISA, 203 
were treated with V920 (1 Dose), 96 with V920 (2 Doses) and 114 with placebo. For PRNT, 140 were 
treated with V920 (1 Dose), 68 with V920 (2 Doses) and 82 with placebo. 
- 12 to 17 years of age: 256 were included in GP-ELISA and 254 in PRNT. Among these, for GP ELISA, 
131 were treated with V920 (1 Dose), 65 with V920 (2 Doses) and 60 with placebo. For PRNT, 130 were 
treated with V920 (1 Dose), 65 with V920 (2 Doses) and 59 with placebo. 
This corresponds to a total PP GP ELISA paediatric population of 784 and a total PP PRNT paediatric

The MAH also provided the numbers of participants (adults and children) randomised for the PP 
population of protocol version 3.0 and protocol version 4.0 combined. Overall, 2,342 out of 2,430 
vaccinated participants (96.4%) were included in the GP-ELISA PP Immunogenicity Population and 1,226 
out of 2,430 vaccinated participants (50.4%) were included in the PRNT analyses under combined 
protocols. 
It is estimated that under protocol version 3.0 respectively 791 participants were included in the GP-
ELISA and 405 in PRNT PP Immunogenicity Populations.  
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary immunogenicity endpoints for superiority analyses 
In children 1 to 17 years of age, the Day 28 GP-ELISA GMT for participants vaccinated with 1 dose or 2 
doses of V920 (pooled V920) was superior to the placebo GMT (p<0.001). Superiority was met under 
protocol version 4.0 (Table 11) and when data combined from both protocol version 3.0 and 4.0 (Table 
12) were analysed.

In children 1 to 17 years of age, the Month 12 GP-ELISA GMT for participants vaccinated with 1 dose of 
V920 was superior to the placebo GMT (p<0.001). Superiority was met under protocol version 4.0 (Table 
13) and when data combined from both Protocol version 3.0 and 4.0 (Table 14) were analysed.

Subgroup analyses in children 1 to 17 years of age (analyses by child age group, sex, and baseline 
serostatus) for the primary superiority analyses showed that the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI of 
the estimated GP-ELISA GMT ratio (V920 group/placebo) was greater than 1 for the antibody response 
for all subgroups at Day 28 for the pooled V920 group/placebo and at Month 12 for the 1-dose V920 
group/placebo.  
Primary and secondary immunogenicity endpoint for non-inferiority analyses 
In children 1 to 17 years of age, the Day 28 GP-ELISA GMT for participants randomised to 1 or 2 doses of 
V920 (pooled V920) was non-inferior to the GP-ELISA GMT of adults participants randomised to 1 or 2 
doses of V920 (pooled V920) with a non-inferiority margin of 0.5 (p<0.001) and with a non-inferiority 
margin of 0.67 (p<0.001).  
The GMT ratio for children/adults was 1.42 (95% CI: 1.24, 1.62) under protocol version 4.0 (Table 15) 
and the GMT ratio for children/adults was 1.34 (95% CI: 1.20, 1.50) (Table 16) when data combined 
from both Protocol Version 3.0 and 4.0 were analysed.

In children 3 to 17 years of age, the Day 28 GP-ELISA GMT for participants randomised to 1 or 2 doses of 
V920 (pooled V920) was non-inferior to the GP-ELISA GMT of adults participants randomised to 1 or 2 
doses of V920 (pooled V920) with a non-inferiority margin of 0.67 (p<0.001).  
The GMT ratio for children (3-17 years)/adults was 1.50 (95% CI: 1.30, 1.72) under protocol version 4.0 
and the GMT ratio for (3-17 years)/adults was 1.38 (95% CI: 1.23, 1.55) when data combined from both 
protocol versions 3.0 and 4.0 were analysed. 
Subgroup analyses (analyses by sex and baseline serostatus) for the primary non-inferiority analysis 
showed that, in children (1-17 or 3-17 years of age) vs adults, the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI of 
the estimated GP-ELISA GMT ratio (pooled V920 [children/adults]) was greater than 1.0 (with a

Descriptive antibody responses data 
GMT GP-ELISA 
Vaccination with V920 elicited an increase in humoral immune response as observed at Day 28 through 
Month 12 post-vaccination, as measured by GP-ELISA, when compared to baseline. 
For the overall GP-ELISA PP Immunogenicity population (children and adults combined), GP-ELISA GMTs 
increased after the first vaccination in the separate (1- and 2-dose V920) and pooled V920 groups, but 
not in the placebo group (Table 17). The GP-ELISA GMTs were higher than baseline at Day 28 for the 
pooled V920 group and at Month 3 and Month 12 for the 1-dose V920 group. 
The GMT for the 2-dose V920 group further increased after the second vaccination (Day 56), with a 3-4 
fold higher GMT measured at Month 3 as compared to Day 28 in the 2 dose V920 group. In this group, 
GMT decreased at Month 12 to a level comparable with the Day 28 2-dose V920 group GMT and the 
Month 12 1-dose V920 group GMT. 
Table 17: Summary of Geometric Mean Titers (GP-ELISA Per-Protocol Immunogenicity Population - 
Protocol version 4.0) 
For children aged 1-17 years (Table 18) and adults (Table 19), GP-ELISA GMTs were higher than baseline 
at Day 28 for the pooled V920 group and at Month 3 and Month 12 for the 1-dose V920 group. GP-ELISA 
GMTs were higher for children (1 to 17 years of age) compared with adults.

GMT PRNT 
Vaccination with V920 elicited a humoral functional immune response through Month 12 post-vaccination 
as measured by the PRNT assay. 
For the overall PRNT PP Immunogenicity population (children and adults combined), PRNT GMTs 
increased after the first vaccination in the separate (1- and 2-dose V920) and pooled V920 groups, but 
not in the placebo group (Table 21). The PRNT GMTs were higher than baseline at Day 28 for the pooled 
V920 group and at Month 3 and Month 12 for the 1-dose V920 group. 
The GMT for the 2-dose V920 group further increased after the second vaccination (Day 56), with a 3-4 
fold higher GMT measured at Month 3 as compared to Day 28 in the 2 dose V920 group. In this group, 
PRNT GMT decreased at Month 12 to levels comparable with the Day 28 2-dose V920 group GMT and the 
Month 12 1-dose V920 group GMT.

Seroresponse rates 
GP-ELISA seroresponse rates 
Most (>94%) participants vaccinated with V920 in the overall GP-ELISA PP immunogenicity population 
had a seroresponse defined as ≥2-fold increase from baseline and ≥200 EU/mL at any time post-
vaccination. The majority (>85%) had a seroresponse defined as ≥4-fold increase from baseline at any 
time postvaccination. Few (<11%) participants who received placebo had a seroresponse by either 
definition. 
The proportions of participants with a seroresponse (≥2-fold increase from baseline and ≥200 EU/mL or 
≥4-fold increase from baseline) were generally comparable for all V920 groups at Day 28. Following 
Extension of indication variation assessment report

second vaccination in the 2-dose V920 group, the proportion of participants with a seroresponse by either 
definition increased at Month 3. At Month 12, the proportion of participants in the 2-dose V920 group with 
a seroresponse by either definition was comparable with the proportion at Day 28 and with the 1-dose 
V920 group at Month 12. 
Table 25: Summary of seroresponse rates (4-Fold Increase from Baseline) (GP-ELISA Per-Protocol 
Immunogenicity Population - Protocol Version 4.0) 
The proportions of participants with a GP-ELISA seroresponse by either definition in the V920 groups 
were lower for baseline seropositive participants (GP-ELISA ≥200 EU/mL) compared with baseline 
seronegative participants (GP-ELISA <200 EU/mL). The proportions of participants with a GP-ELISA 
seroresponse by either definition was comparable for females and males in the V920 groups. 
Concerning GP-ELISA seroresponse rates in the paediatric population, most (>95%) children (1 to 17 
years of age) vaccinated with V920 had a seroresponse defined as ≥2-fold increase from baseline and 
≥200 EU/mL at any time postvaccination and >92% of children had a seroresponse defined as ≥4-fold 
increase from baseline at any time postvaccination.

Most (>96%) participants vaccinated with V920 in the overall PRNT PP immunogenicity population had a 
seroresponse defined as ≥4-fold increase from baseline at any time postvaccination. Few (<3%) 
participants who received placebo had a seroresponse (Table  28). 
The proportions of participants with a seroresponse were comparable for all V920 groups at Day 28. 
Following the second vaccination in the 2-dose V920 group, the proportion of participants with a 
seroresponse increased at Month 3. At Month 12, the proportion of participants in the 2-dose V920 with a 
seroresponse was comparable with the proportion at Day 28 and to the 1-dose V920 group at Month 12.

•  GP-ELISA and PRNT GMTs increased after vaccination in the 1- and 
2 dose V920 groups, but not in the placebo group.  
•  GP-ELISA and PRNT GMTs were higher to baseline and to placebo at 
M12 both in 1-dose and 2-dose V920 
•  GP-ELISA and PRNT GMTs were higher for children (1 to 17 years of 
age) compared with adults at the postvaccination timepoints 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical immunogenicity 
No efficacy studies were conducted in the new targeted population. However, as recommended by the 
SAGE on immunisation, V920 was administered in children over 6 months old and in pregnant and 
lactating women under a compassionate use clinical protocol during the 2018-2020 outbreak in the DRC. 
The MAH is asked to provide available effectiveness data for the paediatric population from V920-EAP5 
(category 3 study of the RMP).  
Hence this application is supported by safety and immunogenicity outcomes. Immune response in 
vaccinated children and in placebo as well as in vaccinated children and adults were compared based on 
comparing ELISA IgG antibody titres. Neutralising Ab was also measured in a subset of participants. In 
the absence of a defined ICP for EVD, it is deemed acceptable to rely on the humoral immunogenicity 
outcomes to reasonably assume a benefit of V920 in protecting children. 
Design and conduct of PREVAC/V920-016 
This study was designed as a Phase II, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 
2 leading Ebola vaccine candidates (Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo and V920) and 3 vaccine strategies 
(Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo, 1-dose V920, and 2
dose V920 administered with a 56 days interval). 
The selected populations are overall deemed as adequate. The study was conducted in four West African 
‑
countries historically at risk of ZEBOV outbreaks and several other clinical trials to study vaccines against 
EVD have been conducted or are ongoing in these countries. Participants with previous history of EVD or 
vaccination against Ebola were to be excluded. The intended study population thus reflected the 
population who might benefit from vaccination. It is however noted that region (urban or rural) was not 
included as a covariate in the ANOVA model used for the immunogenicity analyses, which is considered a 
study limitation. 
Overall, the trial design is deemed acceptable to reach the primary and secondary immunogenicity 
outcomes, but some limitations in the conduct of the study have been noted.  
The study protocol was amended 4 times and V920 was only administered under amended protocol 
version 3.0 (5-May-2017) and amended protocol version 4.0 (15-Mar-2018). 
Participants randomised to V920 under protocol version 4.0 were not all administered identical actual doses 
of  V920.  Two  different  lots  were  used,  i.e.,  lot  WL00063635  corresponding  to  a  final  potency  of 
approximately 1.3E8 pfu/mL and lot WL00067929 corresponding to a final potency of approximately 3.0E8 
pfu/mL. Under protocol version 3.0, 2-fold diluted V920 from an identical drug product lot irrespective from 
trial site (corresponding to a potency level of approximately 5E7 pfu/mL) was administered. 
Dose-adjustment recommendations were issued by WHO during the DRC outbreaks (SAGE on 
immunisation interim recommendations on vaccination against EVD on 7-May-2019) and head-to-head 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/372877/2023

comparisons of V920 adjusted doses with full dose of V920 (to be conducted preferably in Africa) was 
identified as a research need by WHO. As it is considered likely that similar dose-adjustment strategies 
might be recommended in future EVD outbreaks, immunogenicity data generated under protocol version 
3.0 were considered relevant supportive data in the context of this extension of indication application.  
The overall sample size calculation is deemed appropriate. However, a major limitation of the study 
design is that no sample size for each paediatric age category (1 to <3, 3 to <12 and 12 to <18 years of 
age) was pre-specified. The age stratification for enrolment was as per protocol, i.e., 12 to 17, 5 to 11, 
and 1 to 4 years of age whereas the safety and immunogenicity analyses were performed on the age 
strata according to the SAP, following the PDCO request (i.e., 1 to <3, 3 to <12 and 12 to <18 years of 
age). This resulted in different number of subjects included in each of the 3 paediatric age categories and 
in a very limited number of children aged 1 to <3 years of age randomised (in total 155 randomised 
children aged 1 to <3 years of age, as compared to 515 aged 3 to <12 years and 328 aged 12 to <18 
years). It is therefore difficult to draw firm conclusions on the safety and immunogenicity in this 
subpopulation. Moreover, number of participants aged 1 to <3 years included in the PP immunogenicity 
populations were even more limited with 115 included in the GP-ELISA PP immunogenicity population 
(among which 52 randomised to V920 [1 dose]) and 87 included in the PRNT PP immunogenicity 
population (among which 40 randomised to V920 ([1 dose]). In this age subgroup, relative distribution of 
age was however acceptable, with approximately 40% aged ≥1 to <2 years and approximately 60% aged 
≥2 to <3 years in both GP-ELISA and PRNT PP immunogenicity populations. An additional study in young 
children is ongoing (V920-014) and final CSR is expected in 2024 (REC).  
The primary and secondary objectives are endorsed. The primary immunogenicity outcomes rely on the 
comparison of the ZEBOV GP specific humoral immune response in children as compared to placebo 
(superiority) and in vaccinated children as compared to vaccinated adults (non-inferiority) based on GP-
ELISA IgG antibody titres. Moreover, neutralising antibody-responses were also measured in a subset of 
participants to address secondary immunogenicity outcomes (by using PRNT60). Whether GP-ELISA 
and/or PRNT correlate with protection is not known, but in the absence of a defined ICP for EVD, it is 
deemed acceptable to rely on the humoral immunogenicity outcomes to reasonably assume a benefit of 
V920 in protecting children. The margin chosen to demonstrate the NI (lower bound of the 2-sided 95% 
CI greater than 0.5) of the immune response in children compared to adults as part of the primary 
objective is considered not very stringent as it is expected that the children mount a higher antibody 
response following vaccination compared to adults. However, as a more stringent margin (lower bound of 
the 2-sided 95% CI greater than 0.67) is used to demonstrate NI of the immune response in children 
comparted to adults as secondary endpoint, this is considered acceptable. NI was not planned to be 
calculated for age subgroup which would have been valuable. 
The PP population was the primary population for the analysis of immunogenicity data. Primary 
immunogenicity results were based on data from protocol version 4.0. PRNT testing was conducted on 
more than half of children included in the PP GP-ELISA immunogenicity population. This is in accordance 
with the request from the PDCO to test at least 50% of the sera by virus neutralisation. Supportive 
immunogenicity data were also generated under version 3.0 and detailed descriptive data was not 
submitted.  
The statistical methods are overall appropriate.  
Immunogenicity had to be summarized by presenting different parameters including seroprotection if an 
immunological correlate of protection was found based on data of previous studies. Data of study V920-
018 were previously submitted and an attempt to define an ICP (in conjunction with the results of V920-
010) was done (procedure EMEA/H/C/004554/II/0007/G). There were various limitations of the approach 
for the analysis of the correlate of protection. Whether GP-ELISA and/or PRNT are a correlate of 
protection is not known.

The seroresponder definitions are arbitrary, but similar to those used at MAA, hence deemed acceptable. 
Blood sampling in adults and children for immunogenicity testing and future research were planned at 
baseline, Day 7, Day 14, Day 28, Day 56, Day 63, Month 3, Month 6, Month 12. The following day ranges 
were allowed: ±6 for Day 28, ±16 for Month 3 and ±21 for Month 12 timepoints. However, a substantial 
number of samples were out-of-day range, and thus excluded from the PP immunogenicity population. To 
include more participants in the key primary and secondary immunogenicity analyses, post hoc analyses 
that removed restrictions for the prespecified day ranges at each immunogenicity analysis time point 
were conducted. 
Blood samples obtained at early time-point after first vaccination (Day 7 and Day 14) were to be used to 
address immediacy of immune responses by comparing the antibody responses between V920 vaccinated 
participants and the placebo group. The MAH was requested to provide additional antibody responses 
data (Day 7 and Day 14 time-points but was unable to provide such data, as Day 7 and Day 14 samples 
were not tested with validated GP-ELISA and PRNT assays. 
Some secondary objectives described in the protocol that are not addressed by the MAH are considered 
relevant to support this application (refer to blood samples above).  
Another secondary objective described in the protocol but not addressed by the MAH relates to the 
comparison of T cell and memory B cell responses for the three vaccine strategies versus placebo in a 
subsample of adults. Such objective would have been relevant also for younger participants, which have 
an immature / in development immune system as compared to adults. 
In the SAP and in the Protocol version 5.0, long-term follow up of antibody responses at 24, 36, 48 and 
60 months following randomisation is mentioned as a secondary objective. This application is supported 
only by results from the base-study, which is deemed acceptable, but the results of the long-term 
antibody response follow-up should be provided as soon as available (REC).  
Results 
Data obtained for the base study (12-months period after randomisation) for V920 and placebo mainly 
related to protocol version 4.0 were submitted, and data related to version 3.0 were partially presented in 
the CSR and during the assessment of this application. 
Under protocol version 4.0, participant characteristics of the randomised children and adults (for all 
randomised participants and for GP-ELISA PP immunogenicity population) were comparable across study 
intervention groups. In the different age subgroups males were in general overrepresented, but their 
percentages never exceed 60%.  
Concerning protocol version 3.0, only combined (children and adults) demographic characteristics of all 
randomised participants were reported in the CSR and these were overall comparable across the study 
interventions to those of version 4.0. Only 18 children aged 1 to <3 years were recruited (8 were aged 1 
to <2 and 10 were aged 2 to <3), females were overrepresented in this age subgroup.   
Mean BMI in the paediatric and adult population were comparable across study interventions. Mean BMI 
for children was of 16.5 (SD=2.6, median=15.9) with a wide range of 9 to 33. A higher mean BMI of 23.6 
(SD=4.8, median=22.3) was reported for adults, also with a wide BMI range (16 to 50). 
Data on race and prior and concomitant medications/vaccinations were not collected and are therefore 
not reported in the CSR. Participants having received or having taken their own medication for fever and 
pain following vaccination were to be recorded according to the protocol. Fever was reported with a 
higher frequency in children <3 years of age when compared to both other age strata. It is not known if 
Extension of indication variation assessment report

Page 51/81 
 
 
 
 
 
medication against fever and pain was more often/systematically offered to children <3 years of age 
during the conduct of the study. The impact on immunogenicity is neither known. 
Baseline serology results obtained are consistent to those observed in adults at the time of MAA (studies 
V920-009 and V920-011), with a higher proportion of adults seropositive at baseline (23.7%) as 
compared to the paediatric subjects (17.7%), which is expected and acceptable. 
As in the CSR, impact of baseline serostatus is addressed in detail in subgroup analyses, this is deemed 
acceptable. 
Primary immunogenicity endpoints for superiority analyses 
Superiority was formally demonstrated at Day 28 for children randomised to 1 and 2 doses of V920 as 
compared to placebo (1.0 mL) and at Month 12 separately for children respectively randomised either to 
1 or 2 doses of V920 as compared to placebo (p<0.001). 
It seems that superiority as compared to placebo was met also under Protocol Version 3.0. With 
vaccination with 1 dose of V920 in children 1 to 17 years of age resulting in superior GP-ELISA GMT as 
compared to placebo (1.0 mL) both at Day 28 and Month 12 after randomization. Fold Differences were of 
15.56 (95% CI: 12.04, 20.12) and of 15.87 (95% CI: 12.50, 20.15) respectively for Day 28 (pooled 
V920) and Month 12 (1 dose V920) after randomisation. The lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI of the 
estimated GP-ELISA GMT ratio (V920 group/placebo) was greater than 1 for both Day 28 and Month 12. 
For Protocol Version 3.0, the MAH did not provide the p-value for the comparison of the GMT ratio to the 
lower bound as provided for Protocol Version 4.0 and for combined Protocol Version 3.0 and 4.0. 
Post hoc analyses that removed restrictions for the prespecified day ranges at each immunogenicity 
analysis time point were conducted for key primary and secondary immunogenicity analyses of protocol 
version 4.0. Similar results as for the primary analysis were obtained. In the Post-hoc analysis, fold 
differences were of 17.22 (95% CI: 14.31, 20.72) for Day 28 (pooled V920) as compared to 18.15 (95% 
CI: 14.96, 22.01) in the primary analysis (pooled V920). For Month 12 after randomization, fold 
Differences were of 14.29 (95% CI: 12.21, 16.74) in the post-hoc analysis (1 dose V920) as compared to 
14.30 (95% CI: 11.88, 17.20) in the primary analysis (1 dose V920). 
Subgroup analyses in children 1 to 17 years of age (analyses by child age group, sex, and baseline 
serostatus) for the primary superiority analyses for protocol version 4.0 and for combined protocol 
versions 3.0 and 4.0 were presented. For protocol version 3.0, no such subgroup analyses in children 1 to 
17 years of age were presented. 
The presented data showed higher responses in V920 vaccinated as compared to placebo in children 1-17 
years of age with a lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI of the estimated GP-ELISA GMT ratio (V920 
group/placebo) ˃1 for the antibody response for all subgroups at Day 28 for the pooled V920 
group/placebo and at Month 12 for the 1-dose V920 group/placebo. 
Fold Differences for Day 28 (pooled V920) after randomisation were of 25.20 (95% CI: 14.66, 43.31) for 
children younger than 3 years; of 18.02 (95% CI: 13.70, 23.70) for children aged 3 to 11 years; and of 
14.78 (95% CI: 10.97, 19.93) for children aged 12 to 17 years. Fold Differences for Month 12 (1 dose 
V920) after randomisation were of 22.26 (95% CI: 12.73, 38.93) for children younger than 3 years; of 
13.69 (95% CI: 10.82, 17.31) for children aged 3 to 11 years; and of 11.90 (95% CI: 8.44, 16.79) for 
children aged 12 to 17 years. 95% CI were particularly wide for children younger than 3 years. 
For the children aged 1 to <3 years, less than 80 children contributed to the Day 28 subgroup analysis 
and less than 50 children contributed to the Month 12 subgroup analysis under protocol version 4.0. 
These numbers are limited. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/372877/2023 
Page 52/81 
 
 
 
 
 
Moreover, such low numbers might not allow robust conclusion on potential differences in immune 
responses to V920 stratified by sex in children aged 1 to <3 years, which is deemed important to 
investigate. Higher responses to some vaccines in young girls as compared to young boys were 
documented. The requested additional data provided support sex-dependent differences in humoral 
immune responses to V920, with trends towards higher responses in female (maintained up to 12 months 
post-vaccination with a single dose of V920) as compared to male of all age categories.  
It is agreed with the MAH that sample size does not allow to draw any firm conclusions with respect to 
different levels of humoral responses induced by V920 in male as compared to female participants of 
different age categories. In the absence of ICP, the clinical relevance is unknown. 
Primary and secondary immunogenicity endpoint for non-inferiority analyses 
When humoral responses measured in the paediatric population were compared to those in the adult 
population (formal non-inferiority tested only for Day 28 after randomisation, non-inferiority margins of 
0.5 and 0.67), it can be concluded that GP-ELISA GMTs are non-inferior in children as compared to 
adults. Obtained data are rather indicative of higher humoral (binding and neutralizing antibodies) 
responses in vaccinated children as compared to adults. Increased immunogenicity to vaccines is in 
general expected when lowering the age of vaccinees. 
For Protocol Version 3.0, it seems that non-inferiority in Day 28 GP-ELISA GMT of children aged 1-17 
years or 3-17 years as compared to adults were also met. With lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI 
greater than 1 and identical Day 28 GMT ratios of 1.23 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.50) for children (1-17 
years)/adults and for children (3-17 years)/adults. The MAH did not provide the p-value for the 
comparison of the GMT ratio to the lower bound (0.5 or 0.67) as provided for protocol version 4.0 and for 
combined protocols.  
Concerning post-hoc analysis (removing restrictions for the prespecified day ranges) conducted only for 
protocol version 4.0, similar results were obtained. At Day 28 after vaccination, GMT ratios were of 1.43 
(95% CI: 1.26, 1.63) in the post-hoc analysis as compared to 1.42 (95% CI: 1.24, 1.62) in the primary 
analysis for vaccinated children aged 1-17 years compared to adults. 
The MAH specified that sample size did not allow to apply in subgroup non-inferiority analyses the same 
age stratification used in the subgroup superiority analyses (namely 1 to <3, 3 to <12 and 12 to <18 
years of age).  
Descriptive antibody responses data 
Vaccination with V920 elicits a humoral (binding and neutralising) immune response as observed at Day 
28 through Month 12 as measured by GP-ELISA and by PRNT is endorsed. This is true for the overall PP 
Immunogenicity population, when combining the paediatric and adult participants and when analysing 
separately adults and children and consistent also with respect to the submitted GP-ELISA GMFI and 
PRNT GMFI results and with the data of the post-hoc analyses. GP-ELISA GMTs and PRNT GMTs levels 
measured after vaccination appear comparable to the levels reported for adults at the time of the initial 
MAA. 
A similar conclusion can be drawn based on the GP-ELISA GMT, GP-ELISA GMFI, PRNT GMT and PRNT 
GMFI results of the overall PP Immunogenicity population of protocol version 3.0, which indicate that 
vaccination with V920 elicits a durable immune response from Day 28 through Month 12. 
When GP-ELISA results of protocol version 4.0 are compared to those of version 3.0, it seems that 
comparable GMTs were measured. This is further corroborated by the reverse cumulative distribution 
curves of GP-ELISA Titers are overlapping both at Day 28 and Month 12 for participants vaccinated with a 
single dose of V920 under protocol version 3.0 and 4.0. despite administration of a dose of V920 that is 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/372877/2023 
Page 53/81 
 
 
 
 
 
below the minimum licensed potency value under protocol version 3.0 (final potency of administered dose 
of approximately 5E7 pfu).  
When PRNT60 results of protocol version 4.0 are compared to those of version 3.0, it seems however that 
higher GMTs were measured under protocol version 4.0. Under both versions, PRNT baseline immunity 
was comparable. The fact that neutralizing antibody responses measured by PRNT60 following vaccination 
with a single dose of V920 are higher for protocol version 4.0 is further corroborated by the reverse 
cumulative distribution curves of PRNT Titers that are non-overlapping both at Day 28 and Month 12 for 
participants vaccinated with a single dose of V920. Statistical significance of the differences in the PRNT60 
results was not discussed by the MAH and clinical relevance of the differences in PRNT60 results is 
unknown in the absence of a defined ICP for EVD. 
Under protocol version 4.0, participants were recruited in all the 4 countries and 6 sites (35% in Guinea, 
25% in Sierra Leone, 22% in Mali, and 17% in Liberia), while under protocol version 3.0 a majority of 
approximately 75% of participants were recruited in Guinea and the remaining in Liberia. In addition, 
participants randomised to V920 under protocol version 4.0 were not all administered identical actual 
doses of V920. The 204 participants randomised to V920 in Liberia were administered undiluted V920 Lot 
WL00063635 and the 996 participants randomised to V920 in Guinea Country, Mali, and Sierra Leone 
(respectively 428, 265 and 303) were administered undiluted V920 lot WL00067929. On the other hand, 
all participants randomised to V920 under protocol version 3.0 (Guinea Country and Liberia) were 
administered identical actual doses of V920 from an identical drug product lot.  
In order to rule out a country-bias and a drug product lot bias in the measured antibody responses, the 
MAH was requested to provide descriptive GP-ELISA and PRNT GMT data for participants randomised in 
Guinea and Liberia separately for Protocol Version 3.0 and 4.0.  
Overall, submitted data do not indicate major country- and drug product lot- biases in antibody measured 
immune responses. 
The MAH stated that GP-ELISA GMTs and PRNT GMTs were higher for children (1 to 17 years of age) 
compared with adults. The MAH did not clarify if GP-ELISA GMTs were higher for children (1 to 17 years 
of age) compared with adults also under protocol version 3.0. 
Overall, submitted graphs for protocol version 4.0 support the MAH’s conclusion that vaccination with 
V920 elicits a humoral (binding and neutralising) immune response at Day 28 and Month 12 in all 
paediatric age-categories (as measured by GP-ELISA and by PRNT assays), with no major notable 
differences in the different paediatric age-categories. 
However, when GP-ELISA GMT are compared in the different paediatric age subgroups (namely 1 to <3, 3 
to <12, and 12 to <18 years of age) randomised to 1 dose V920 under Protocol Version 4.0, it was noted 
that in children aged 3 to <12 years and in children aged 12 to <18 years GMTs decrease between Day 
28 and Month 3 and that GMTs are comparable between Month 3 and Month 12. However, in children 
aged 1 to <3 years, GP-ELISA GMTs were comparable between Day 28 and Month 3 but GMTs increased 
between Month 3 and Month 12, which is an unexpected trend of the antibody response following 
vaccination. The MAH provided graphs representing individual trajectories of GP-ELISA and PRNT 
responses for children aged 1 to <3 years and children aged ≥3 to <18 years, which indicated that trends 
in the immunogenicity responses measured by GP-ELISA and PRNT assays are comparable and consistent 
for both age categories. 
Concerning PRNT GMT, the MAH was requested to provide an explanation for the fact that a drop in PRNT 
titres at Month 3 followed by an increase in PRNT titers at Month 12 was observed in all age groups. In 
that respect, data of the primary analysis and of the post-hoc analysis were consistent. Such kinetic of 
the PRNT response was consistent with clinical previously generated. The mechanisms behind this kinetic 
of PRNT responses following vaccination with V920 are not elucidated. The MAH hypothesises that initial 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/372877/2023 
Page 54/81 
 
 
 
 
 
elevation in PRNT responses is driven by low affinity IgG and IgM neutralising antibodies, which wanes 
prior to subsequent affinity maturation. The latter would lead to an overall increase in binding affinities 
and neutralisation potency at the later timepoints. It is not fully clear to which previous clinical data (with 
the licensed dose level) the MAH refers (Month 3 PRNT data not found) but it is agreed with the MAH that 
the clinical relevance of the observed kinetic of PRNT responses is unknown. 
When GP-ELISA and PRNT results were analysed by baseline serostatus of participants (baseline 
seronegative or baseline seropositive GP-ELISA ≥200 EU/mL), GP-ELISA GMTs were generally higher for 
baseline seropositive participants as compared to baseline seronegative participants and GP-ELISA GMFIs 
were impacted by baseline serostatus. Noteworthy, baseline serostatus of participants did not have a 
pronounced impact on PRNT GMTs or PRNT GMFIs.  
The observation that baseline serostatus of participants did not have a pronounced impact on PRNT GMTs 
or PRNT GMFIs, along with the observation that PRNT GMTs measured under Protocol Version 3.0 were 
lower as compared to those measured under protocol version 4.0, while GP-ELISA GMTs are comparable 
between versions 3.0 and 4.0 is unexpected. Binding and nAb might have a different kinetic of response 
following vaccination or such difference might also be due to the limited sample size. The clinical 
relevance of this observation is not known. 
Seroresponse rates 
Overall, the GP-ELISA seroresponse rates by either definition (≥2-fold increase from baseline and ≥200 
EU/mL or ≥4-fold increase from baseline) measured in adults of the PREVAC/V920-016 study was 
comparable to the seroresponse rates that were reported at the time of MAA. A trend for slightly higher 
PRNT seroresponse rates measured at Day 28 and Month 12 in adults of the PREVAC/V920-016 were 
observed when compared to the seroresponse rates that were reported at the time of MAA (V920-009). 
95% CI overlapped. 
When GP-ELISA seroresponse rates measured under protocol version 4.0 are compared to those of 
version 3.0, it seems that very comparable seroresponse rates by either definition was achieved. 
Under protocol version 4.0, the proportions of participants with a GP-ELISA seroresponse defined as ≥4-
fold increase from baseline were generally higher for children as compared to adults in the V920 groups 
at all time-points after vaccination. This was also observed under protocol version 3.0.  
A drop at Month 3 followed by an increase at Month 12 was also observed for PRNT seroresponse rates in 
all age groups. Higher rates were observed under protocol version 4.0 as compared to version 3.0. This is 
also consistent with descriptive PRNT antibody responses data discussed previously. 
Concerning the impact of baseline immunity on GP-ELISA seroresponse rates and PRNT seroresponse 
rates, as expected the proportions of participants with a GP-ELISA seroresponse by either definition in the 
V920 groups were lower for baseline seropositive participants (GP-ELISA ≥200 EU/mL) compared with 
baseline seronegative participants (GP-ELISA <200 EU/mL). Nevertheless, the proportions of PRNT 
responders were comparable for baseline seronegative and baseline seropositive (GP-ELISA ≥200 EU/mL) 
participants. This is also consistent with descriptive GP-ELISA and PRNT antibody responses data 
described previously.  
Comparable data were obtained in the primary and post-hoc analyses (removing restrictions for the 
prespecified day ranges) for GP-ELISA seroresponse rates by definition and PRNT seroresponse rates. No 
comparison of GP-ELISA seroconversion and PRNT seroconversion rates of protocol versions 3.0 and 4.0 
was provided. 
Booster dose 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/372877/2023 
Page 55/81 
 
 
 
 
 
Humoral immunogenicity data was generated in subjects randomised to 2 doses of V920 (administered 
with an interval of 56 days). Increased GP-ELISA GMTs and GMFIs, and increased PRNT GMTs and GMFIs 
were measured at Month 3 as compared to participants vaccinated with a single dose of V920. However, 
humoral responses measured at Month 12 indicate that comparable responses were induced in 
participants randomised to 1 dose of V920 as compared to 2 doses of V920 at this later time-point. 
Therefore, the MAH concluded that though the second dose of V920 was immunogenic, no advantage of 
the booster dose (administered with an interval of 56 days) was observed at 12 months as compared to a 
single dose of V920. This conclusion is endorsed. The MAH mentioned that a clinical study determining 
the effect of a booster V920 dose given at a wider interval (18 months) is ongoing (PREPARE - V920-013) 
but no data were submitted in this application (already requested as a REC before this application).  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical immunogenicity 
The reported humoral immunogenicity data collectively indicate that immunisation with 1 dose of V920 
induces an increase in both neutralising and binding antibody titers against the vaccine virus and ZEBOV-
GP, respectively, when compared to baseline, both in children 1 to 17 years of age and adults. Responses 
in children are non-inferior to those measured in adults and humoral responses higher than baseline 
values are maintained up to 1-year post-vaccination. 
Limited number of children aged 1 to <3 years of age were randomised in V920-016 study, with for 
example less than 50 children contributing to GP-ELISA subgroup analysis. These numbers are considered 
limited to draw firm conclusions on the immunogenicity in this subpopulation and additional 
immunogenicity data from ongoing studies should be submitted when available. However, immune 
responses were detected in the majority of children less than 3 years following vaccination, with no major 
concern and seroresponse rates were higher than 80% at Day 28. 
Recommendations (REC) are considered necessary to address issues related to immunogenicity (see 
section 3.8 – Conclusions).  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Brief summary of the existing safety profile of Ervebo in the existing indication: 
Anaphylaxis was reported very rarely (0.006%) in clinical trials. The most common injection-site adverse 
reactions were injection-site pain (70.3%), swelling (16.7%) and erythema (13.7%). The most common 
systemic adverse reactions reported following vaccination were headache (36.9%), pyrexia (34.3%), 
myalgia (32.5%), fatigue (18.5%), arthralgia (17.1%), nausea (8.0%), chills (6.3%), arthritis (3.7%), 
rash (3.6%), hyperhidrosis (3.2%), and abdominal pain (1.4%). 
In general, these reactions were reported within 7 days after vaccination, were mild to moderate in 
intensity, and had short duration (less than 1 week). 
Key safety endpoints: 
- Solicited injection-site AEs and solicited systemic AEs of any grade severity, and Grade 3 or 4 
unsolicited AEs after first vaccination and through Days 7, 14, and 28 after first vaccination 
- Solicited injection-site AEs and solicited systemic AEs of any grade severity, and Grade 3 or 4 
unsolicited AEs after second vaccination, through Day 7 after second vaccination, and through 
Month 1 after second vaccination

- SAEs through Month 12. 
Exposure 
In the study V920-016, a total of 2002 participants (998 children, 1004 adults) were randomised to the 
V920 and placebo groups under Protocol Version 4.0 (approved dose). All participants received the first 
vaccination and most (95.9%) received both vaccinations to which they were randomised. 
The APaT population consisted of 2000 randomised participants (996 children, 1004 adults) who received 
at least 1 dose of V920, 0.5-mL placebo, or 1.0-mL placebo. 
Two participants (1 child in the 1-dose V920 group and 1 child in the placebo group) received an incorrect 
study intervention and were excluded from the APaT population. 
Demographic and other characteristics of study population 
Demographic characteristics were generally comparable across study intervention groups for children. The 
median age for children was 8.0 years (range: 1 to 17 years); 15.5% of children randomised were 1 to 
<3 years of age, 51.6% were 3 to <12 years of age, and 32.9% were 12 to 17 years of age. 
Approximately half (54.7%) were male, and none were HIV-positive. 
Table 30 Participants Characteristics 
With Protocol Version 4, the number of children by age categories are: 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/372877/2023 
Page 57/81 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- From 12 to 17 years of age: 204 who received 1 dose of V920 (138 children in the 1 dose group 
and 66 children in the 2-dose group) 
- From 3 to 11 years of age: 310 who received 1 dose of V920 (213 children in the 1 dose group 
and 97 children in the 2-dose group) 
- From 1 to 3 years of age: 95 who received 1 dose of V920 (56 children in the 1 dose group and 
39 children in the 2-dose group): 
- From 2 to 3 years of age: 54 children were vaccinated with V920 
- From 1 to <2 years of age: 41 children were vaccinated with V920 
With Protocol Version 3, the number of children by age categories are approximatively: 
- From 12 to 17 years of age: 181 who received 1 dose of V920 (127 children in the 1 dose group 
and 54 children in the 2-dose group) 
- From 3 to 11 years of age: 152 who received 1 dose of V920 (103 children in the 1 dose group 
and 49 children in the 2-dose group) 
- From 1 to 3 years of age: 10 who received 1 dose of V920 (8 children in the 1 dose group and 2 
children in the 2-dose group) 
Demographic characteristics were generally comparable across study intervention groups for adults. The 
median age for adults was 27.0 years (range: 18 to 76 years); 98.2% of adults were between the ages of 
18 and 65 years. Approximately half (54.6%) were male, and 1.9% were HIV-positive. 
Adverse events 
The pooled V920 group was used to describe the safety of V920 compared with placebo in the safety 
follow-up period after the first vaccination and the 2 dose V920 group was used to describe the safety of 
V920 in the safety follow-up period after the second vaccination. Results were considered comparable if 
the percent difference between groups was <10% and higher or lower if the percent difference was 
>10%. 
The analyses of AEs for participants randomised under protocol version 3.0 (diluted V920) and protocol 
version 4.0 indicate that V920 was generally well tolerated in children and adults who received a 1-dose 
or 2-dose regimen. No vaccine-related SAEs were reported for any participants. 
With protocol version 4.0, the majority of children and adults experienced 1 or more AEs from the first 
vaccination visit to Day 28 after first vaccination. The proportions of children (85%) and adults (76%) 
who experienced an injection-site AE or non injection-site AE were higher in the pooled V920 group 
compared with the placebo group (+/- 66%), with the greatest difference observed for injection-site AEs. 
Fewer than half of children and adults in the pooled V920 and placebo groups experienced 1 or more 
injection-site AE; the majority (>60%) reported 1 or more non injection site (systemic) AE. 
The proportions of children and adults who experienced 1 or more AEs from the second vaccination visit 
to Day 28 after the second vaccination were generally comparable across intervention groups and AE 
categories with the exception of injection-site AEs, which were higher in the 2-dose V920 group compared 
with the 1-dose V920 and placebo groups. 
The proportions of children and adults who experienced a SAE were low and comparable for the pooled 
V920 and placebo groups from the first vaccination to the end of the base study. No participants 
discontinued from study intervention due to an AE or SAE.

Five children (3 in the 1-dose V920 group, 2 in the placebo group) and 4 adults (3 in the 1-dose V920 
group, 1 in the placebo group) died during the study. None of the SAEs or deaths were considered related 
to study intervention by the investigator. 
Summary of AEs in children compared with adults 
In the pooled V920 group after the first vaccination, the proportion of children who experienced 1 or more 
AEs was higher than adults mainly due to a higher proportions of children with injection-site AEs 
compared with adults (17.7% difference [95% CI: 12.4, 23.0]). The proportions of children with non-
injection site AEs and non-serious AEs were also higher compared with adults. 
The AE profiles for children and adults in the 2-dose V920 group after the second vaccination were 
generally comparable.

Participants as Treated – Protocol Version 4) (Children) 
Table 32 Adverse Event Summary (First Vaccination Visit to Day 28 After First Vaccination) (All 
Participants as Treated – Protocol Version 4) (Adults) 
Both injection-site reactions and targeted symptoms were solicited in this study. All solicited injection-site 
and systemic AEs were collected regardless of grade and were considered related to study intervention 
per protocol. 
The most commonly reported AEs for children and adults were solicited injection-site AEs and solicited 
systemic AEs. The majority of participants in the pooled V920 and placebo groups for children and adults 
experienced 1 or more solicited injection-site AEs or solicited systemic AEs from Day 1 to Day 28 after the 
first vaccination. Lower proportions of children and adults in the 2-dose V920 group and placebo group 
reported 1 or more solicited AEs from the Day 1 visit to the Month 1 visit after the second vaccination.

Solicited Injection-site Adverse Events (injection-site reaction) 
Less than half of children and adults reported solicited injection-site AEs from the Day 1 visit to the Day 
28 visit after the first vaccination. Injection-site AEs were reported for a higher proportion of participants 
in the pooled V920 group compared with the placebo group for both children and adults. In the pooled 
V920 group, solicited injection-site AEs were reported more frequently for children compared with adults. 
The proportions of participants in the 2-dose V920 group with solicited injection-site AEs from Day 1 after 
the second vaccination to Month 1 after the second vaccination (20.7% children, 16.0% adults) were 
lower as compared with after first vaccination (37.4% children, 25.1% adults) but higher compared with 
placebo (8.5% children, 8.3% adults). 
Injection-site pain was the most frequently reported injection-site AE for both children and adults and 
was reported more frequently for children compared with adults. 
Injection-site pain was reported for 41.6% of children and 21.5% of adults in the pooled V920 group from 
the first vaccination visit to Day 28 after the first vaccination visit. Most AEs of injection-site pain were 
reported in the first 7 days after the first vaccination visit for both children and adults. The highest 
frequency of reported injection-site pain in children during this time period based on daily contacts was 
32.6% for the pooled V920 group and 6.7% for the placebo group at the Day 1 visit. At the Day 7 visit, 
injection-site pain was reported for 18.4% of children in the pooled V920 group and 3.4% in the placebo 
group. At the Day 7 visit for adults (retrospective since the first vaccination visit), injection-site pain was 
reported for 18.4% in the pooled V920 group and 2.4% in the placebo group. 
Injection-site pain was reported less frequently in the 2-dose V920 group after the second vaccination 
compared with after first vaccination. 
Solicited Systemic Adverse Events (targeted symptoms) 
The following solicited systemic AEs were collected as one line item in the CRF and were reported as a 
single term in the solicited systemic AE tables in this Summary of Clinical Safety: 
- “Reduced activity, somnolence, fatigue” are reported as the term “somnolence”. 
- “Skin lesions (macules, papules, purpura, petechiae)” are reported as the term “skin lesion”. 
- “Irritability/fussiness” are reported as the term “irritability”. 
After First Vaccination 
The proportions of children and adults with solicited systemic AEs were higher for the pooled V920 group 
compared with the placebo group from the Day 1 visit to the Day 28 visit after the first vaccination. The 
most commonly (>20%) reported solicited systemic AEs in children were pyrexia, headache, somnolence, 
and decreased appetite. In adults, headache, pyrexia, myalgia, and somnolence. For the individual events 
in children and adults, the proportions of participants were comparable across intervention groups with 
the exception of pyrexia, headache, somnolence, and myalgia, which were reported with a higher 
incidence in V920 groups compared with placebo. Overall, solicited systemic AEs were reported most 
frequently at the Day 7 visit in children (59.0% pooled V920 group, 41.2% placebo group) and adults 
(65.5% pooled V920 group, 43.4% placebo group). 
After Second Vaccination 
Solicited systemic AEs were reported less frequently after the second vaccination compared with the first 
vaccination for children and adults. The incidence of solicited systemic AEs in the 2 dose V920 group was 
comparable with the placebo group for both children and adults after the second vaccination. The most

commonly (>20%) reported solicited systemic AEs in the 2-dose V920 group for children were pyrexia 
and headache (with comparable incidences in the placebo group). Only the solicited systemic AE of 
headache was reported at an incidence >20% in the 2-dose group for adults (with comparable incidence 
in the placebo group).

Unsolicited adverse events 
Only Grade 3 and Grade 4 unsolicited AEs were reported during the study. Four participants (2 children 
and 2 adults) reported a Grade 3 or Grade 4 unsolicited AE: 
- One child in the 2-dose V920 group with Grade 4 unilateral blindness. This SAE was considered 
not related to study intervention by the investigator  
- One child in the 2
dose V920 group with Grade 3 insomnia 
- One adult in the 1-dose V920 group with Grade 3 hypertension 
‑
- One adult in the placebo group with Grade 3 toothache 
The MAH confirmed that no cases of vesicular rash were observed in children nor in adults:  
Skin lesion was reported for 22 (5.4%) children in the V920 1-Dose group, 8 (4.0%) children in the V920 
2-dose group, and 32 (8.2%) children in the placebo group. Skin lesion was reported for 12 (3.0%) 
adults in the V920 1-Dose group, 3 (1.6%) adults in the V920 2-dose group, and 10 (2.4%) adults in the 
placebo group. 
Joint swelling was reported for 2 (0.5%) children in the V920 1-Dose group, 1 (0.5%) child in the V920 
2-dose group, and 2 (0.5%) children in the placebo group. Joint swelling was reported for 3 (0.7%) 
adults in the V920 1-Dose group, 1 (0.5%) adult in the V920 2-dose group, and 0 (0.0%) adults in the 
placebo group. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
Nine deaths were reported, and were considered not related to the study intervention by the investigator:   
Children (n=5): 
- 1-dose V920 group: drowning (n=1); “death”, with primary cause of death reported as pyrexia 
(n=1); and “death”, with primary cause of death reported as unknown (n=1) 
- Placebo group: sickle cell anaemia with crisis (n=1); and “death”, with primary cause of death 
reported as unknown (n=1) 
Adults (n=4): 
- 1-dose V920 group: sepsis (n=1), HIV infection (n=1), and appendicitis (n=1) 
- Placebo group: anaemia (n=1) 
The primary cause of death was unknown for 1 child in the 1-dose V920 group (Day 164 after the second 
vaccination, with placebo) and 1 child in the placebo group (Day 51 after the first vaccination). The death 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/372877/2023 
Page 62/81 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reported with primary cause of pyrexia for 1 child in the 1-dose V920 group occurred on Day 110 after 
the second vaccination, with placebo. The relative days of death were remote from the day of vaccination 
with V920 and past the postvaccination time period for reporting of AEs. These participants did not 
experience any vaccine-related non-serious AEs during the time period in which they were observed at 
the healthcare centres.  
Two adult participants randomised to the 1-dose V920 group under Protocol Version 4.0 did not have an 
outcome of “fatal” recorded for the SAE resulting in death at the time of data entry and therefore, were 
not included in AE summary tables. The causes of death for these participants were reported in the Death 
Declaration CRFs as HIV infection and appendicitis. 
Other SAE 
The proportions of children and adults who experienced one or more SAEs from the first vaccination to 
the end of the base study were low and comparable for the pooled V920 and placebo groups. 
SAEs reported for children and adults from the first vaccination to the end of the base study were mostly 
single events with the exception of death, appendicitis, malaria, and ill-defined disorder (1 participant in 
the 1-dose V920 group with polycystic ovary and appendicitis; 1 participant in the 2-dose V920 group 
with severe malaria, anaemia, prostration, and hypoglycaemia; 1 participant in the placebo group with 
hematoma of soft tissue). Two participants had laboratory-confirmed malaria requiring hospitalisation. 
After the second vaccination, the proportions of children and adults who experienced SAEs were 
comparable for the 2-dose V920 and placebo groups. 
No participants had an SAE considered by the investigator to be vaccine related and no SAEs led to 
discontinuation from the study. With the exception of a single event of pyrexia in a child in the 1-dose 
V920 group, all of the SAEs were unsolicited events. 
The assessment of SAEs for the protocol version 4.0 and 3.0 population showed no emergent pattern of 
SAEs after participants were administered either dose of V920 during the study.

V920 shedding in children (Study V920-016 PREVAC) 
V920 shedding was assessed at baseline and Days 7, 14, 28, 56 (day of second vaccination), and 63, and 
month 3. Overall, 31.7% (19/60) of children in the pooled V920 group shed vaccine virus after the first 
vaccination under protocol version 4.0. Submitted data indicate that in children aged 3-17 years, 
shedding peaked between Day 7 and Day 14 following administration of the first dose of V920 both for 
protocol version 3.0 and 4.0, with no shedding detected in either the 1- or 2-dose V920 groups at Day 
56. No shedding was observed after the second vaccination (Day 56) in the children in this subset who 
received 2 doses of V920 (n=21). 
The results observed for the subgroups of children 3 to <12 and 12 to 17 years of age were comparable 
with those observed for children overall. No shedding was detected in children 1 to <3 years of age. 
Numbers of participants aged 1 to <3 years included in the shedding substudy were as follow: 
Under protocol version 4.0: 
•  1-dose V920 group: 2 participants (1 year: n=0; 2 years: n=2) 
•  2-dose V920 group: 3 participants (1 year: n=1; 2 years: n=2) 
• 
Placebo group: 3 participants (1 year: n=1; 2 years: n=2) 
Under protocol version 3.0: 
•  1-dose V920 group: 1 participant (1 year: n=0; 2 years: n=1) 
•  2-dose V920 group: 0 participants (1-2 years, n=0) 
• 
Placebo group: 0 participants (1-2 years, n=0)

Quantitative RT-PCR data and individual trajectories of copies/mL over time indicate that in children aged 
3-17 years, shedding peaked at a mean of Day 8.7 and 10.8 post dose 1 for the V920 1-dose and 2-dose 
groups under protocol version 4.0. Under protocol version 3.0, shedding peaked at a mean of Day 9.7 
and Day 11.0 post dose 1 for the V920 1-dose and 2-dose groups, respectively.

Laboratory findings 
No clinically significant changes in biochemical markers or complete blood count over time were observed 
for children in any of the study intervention groups. 
Vital signs, physical findings and other observations 
Solicited maximum temperature 
Body temperature measurements (temporal) were obtained from children at daily contacts and study 
visits and adults at study visits. Participants did not record daily temperatures outside of the scheduled 
visits for children and adults and daily contacts for children. 
Overall, the majority (94.3%) of children and most (99.6%) adults had a maximum body temperature of 
<38.0°C from the first vaccination visit to Day 28 after the first vaccination. The remainder experienced 
at least one occurrence of elevated body temperature (maximum body temperature ≥38.0°C) after the 
first vaccination. For both children and adults, the proportions of participants with elevated body 
temperature were generally similar for the pooled V920 and placebo groups. 
The proportion of participants in the pooled V920 group with elevated body temperature (maximum body 
temperature ≥38.0°C) after the first vaccination was higher for children compared with adults (7.4% vs 
0.5%). The proportion of participants with elevated body temperatures in the 2-dose V920 group was 
lower after the second vaccination compared with the first vaccination (1.0% children, 0.0% adults).

In the pooled V920 group, 10.9% of children who took an antipyretic and 2.7% of children who did not 
take an antipyretic experienced elevated body temperature (maximum body temperature ≥38.0°C) after 
the first vaccination. 
Participants were queried regarding feverishness since their last visit to determine AEs of pyrexia. The 
vast majority of AEs of pyrexia (>98%) were Grade 1 or Grade 2.

Physical examinations in children 
There were no clinically meaningful safety-related findings in children as a result of the physical 
examination assessments (height, weight, and mid-upper arm circumference). The assessments were 
comparable across intervention groups. 
Safety in special populations 
Safety analyses were conducted for children based on the following age subgroups: 1 to <3 years, 3 to 
<12 years, and 12 to 17 years. 
Version 4 (main data) 
The percentage of subjects with one or more adverse events was 88% in the age category below 3 years, 
86% between 3 to 11 years, and 83% in the age category 12 to 17 years of age. 
The safety profile in the different age categories was in general comparable apart from pyrexia which was 
observed more frequently in the youngest age category (1 to 3 years of age: 83% of subjects, 3 to 11 
years of age: 65%, 12 to 17 years of age: 48%). But pyrexia was also observed more frequently in the 
placebo arm in this population (1 to 3 years of age: 67% of subjects, 3 to 11 years of age: 37%, 12 to 17 
years of age: 28%). 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/372877/2023 
Page 66/81 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Only small number of patients did experience a SAE (1 to 3 years of age: 1.1% of subjects, 3 to 11 years 
of age: 1.9%, 12 to 17 years of age: 2.5%). 
Pooled version 3 (supportive data) and 4 (main data) 
The percentage of subjects with one or more adverse events was 92.4% in the age category below 3 
years, 89.6% between 3 to 11 years, and 81.6% in the age category 12 to 17 years of age. 
The safety profile in the different age categories was in general comparable apart from pyrexia which was 
observed more frequently in the youngest age category (1 to 3 years of age: 87.6% of subjects, 3 to 11 
years of age: 70.1%, 12 to 17 years of age: 43.1%). But pyrexia was also observed more frequently in 
the placebo arm in this population (1 to 3 years of age: 75% of subjects, 3 to 11 years of age: 45.8%, 12 
to 17 years of age: 30.6%). 
Concerning the solicited events per grade, similar patterns were seen in the different age categories. Only 
small number of patients did experience a SAE (1 to 3 years of age: 1% of subjects, 3 to 11 years of age: 
1.9%, 12 to 17 years of age: 2.3%). 
V920 was generally well tolerated by participants in each age subgroup. The AE profiles (in terms of AE 
categories and frequency) for the subgroups of children were generally consistent with the population of 
children 1 to 17 years of age with the exception of injection-site AEs in the V920 groups, which were 
reported less frequently in children 1 to <3 years of age. 
The proportions of participants who experienced 1 or more AEs from the first vaccination to the end of the 
base study were generally comparable for the pooled V920 group and placebo group in children 1 to <3 
years of age but higher for the pooled V920 group compared with the placebo group in children 3 to <12 
years of age and 12 to 17 years of age. Across age subgroups, the proportions of children with SAEs were 
low and generally comparable for the pooled V920 and placebo groups; no vaccine-related SAEs, vaccine-
related deaths, or discontinuations from study intervention due to an AE were reported. The proportions 
of participants who died were comparable for the pooled V920 and placebo groups for children 3 to <12 
years of age and 12 to 17 years of age; no deaths were reported for children 1 to <3 years of age. 
Trends toward higher proportions of participants with injection-site AEs but lower proportions of 
participants with non-injection-site AEs were observed in the oldest subgroup of children (12 to 17 years 
of age) compared with the youngest (1 to <3 years of age). 
The most commonly (>20% in one or more vaccination groups) reported solicited injection site AE after 
the first vaccination among the subgroups of children was injection site pain. Injection-site pain was more 
frequently reported for children 3 to 11 and 12 to 17 years of age than in children 1 to <3 years of age. 
The 3 most commonly reported solicited systemic AEs in the pooled V920 group were pyrexia, crying, and 
decreased appetite for children 1 to <3 years of age; pyrexia, headache, and decreased appetite for 
children 3 to <12 years of age; and headache, pyrexia, and myalgia for children 12 to 17 years of age. 
Pyrexia was reported for a higher proportion of children 1 to <3 years of age compared with children 3 to 
<12 and 12 to 17 years of age.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
V920 was not administered concomitantly with any other vaccines in the V920-016 study. Therefore, 
vaccine interactions were not evaluated. 
Post marketing experience 
As of the PSUR covering the reporting period from 11-May-2021 to 10-Nov-2021, cumulatively, 
approximately 4800 subjects (non-study) were estimated to have been vaccinated with licensed doses of 
V920, based on the assumption that every dose released from the licensed dose stockpiles was used in a 
non-study setting, and each subject received one dose. There were no records of any registration being 
revoked or withdrawn for safety reasons. During the reporting interval of this PSUR, there were no 
safety-related updates to the CCSI for V920. It was concluded that overall, the previously established 
favourable benefit-risk profile for V920 was reconfirmed by the efficacy and safety data that became 
available during this reporting interval. 
There was no published literature that described new and potentially important safety information on 
Ebola Zaire vaccine. 
Using an aggregate data analysis tool, the company safety database was searched for spontaneous 
reports cumulatively through 31-Jan-2022. A total of 16 spontaneous reports containing 63 events (1 
serious, 62 non-serious) were identified.

Extension of indication variation assessment report

There were 7 female and 8 male subjects in the 16 cases, with gender information not provided in 1 case. 
Subject age (available in 14 cases) ranged from 28 to 46 years.  
The only serious event (PT hypoxia) was from literature report which included 5 subjects who received 
V920 as post-exposure prophylaxis after a potential exposure to EBOV in West Africa. Limited details 
were provided concerning this event (including no information on time-to-onset, clinical course, medical 
history, or concomitant medications), which precludes meaningful assessment. 
Of the 62 non-serious events, event outcome was reported as recovering/recovered in 59 events, not 
recovered for 1 event, and unknown for 2 events. 41 of the 62 non-serious events (PT nausea, chills, 
fatigue, injection-site pain, pyrexia, vaccination-site pain, vaccination-site reaction, arthralgia, myalgia, 
headache, rash, hyperhidrosis) are listed or consistent with listed events in the CCSI for V920. Of the 
remaining 21 events, 2 events (which were reported in the same case) with the PT ADR and ill-defined 
disorder are non-specific and provide limited information which precludes meaningful assessment. 
Conclusions from the review of the cases containing the remaining 19 non-serious events were that there 
was insufficient information to assess a causal relationship between the events and V920. 
An analysis of post-marketing data received from spontaneous sources did not identify any cases in 
paediatric subjects. No new safety issues were identified from this review. The MAH will continue to 
monitor the safety of V920 through routine pharmacovigilance. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
As presented by the MAH, data obtained with protocol version 4.0 (approved dose) are mainly shown in 
this report while data obtained with protocol version 3.0 are considered as supportive.  
For adults and children, the MAH pooled the data after dose 1 (1st group) with data after dose 1 in the 2-
dose group (2nd group) as the approved posology is only one dose (protocol version 4.0). This is 
considered acceptable and therefore, the data after 2 doses of V920 are not discussed in this report. 
The safety profile in the different age categories is in general comparable apart from pyrexia which was 
observed more frequently in the youngest age category (1 to 3 years of age). But pyrexia was also 
observed more frequently in the placebo arm in this population. 
The proportions of children and adults who experienced an SAE were low and comparable for the pooled 
V920 and placebo groups from the first vaccination to the end of the base study. No participants 
discontinued from study intervention due to an AE or SAE. Five children (3 in the 1-dose V920 group, 2 in 
the placebo group) and 4 adults (3 in the 1 dose V920 group, 1 in the placebo group) died during the 
study. None of the SAEs or deaths were considered related to study intervention by the investigator. 
Overall, no differences were identified between the safety data with protocol version 4.0 compared to the 
pooled version 3.0 (supportive data) and version 4.0. 
Shedding 
The aim of the saliva shedding substudy was to estimate the proportion of children who have detectable 
vaccine virus by qRT-PCR but also to quantify vaccine virus levels shed after a prime and a boost vaccine 
dose. The MAH only submitted data on the proportion of tested participants with shedding > 0 and was 
requested to also submit quantitative data and individual trajectories of copies/mL over time, with data 
stratified by age and presented separately for protocol versions 3.0 and 4.0.  
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/372877/2023 
Page 70/81 
 
 
 
 
 
Under protocol version 4.0, a total of 5 participants aged 1 to <3 years were randomised to V920 (1 or 2 
doses) and under version 3.0, just one participant. Given the limited sample size, no conclusions can be 
drawn for this age category and data from the V920-014 trial should be submitted when available (REC). 
In study V920-007, V920 shedding was detected in the saliva of a higher proportion of school-age 
children and adolescents compared to adults in general (all studies).  
At Day 7, V920 RNA was detectable in saliva in 35% of school-age children and in 88% of adolescents. 
The maximum shedding value was 7x104 copies/mL in adolescent saliva. The proportion of V920 positive 
saliva samples at Day 7 is lower in the V920-016 study. The MAH hypotheses that this difference could be 
the result of a lower age range for children in V920-016 (1 to 17 years of age) compared with V920-007 
(6 to 17 years of age) and/or differences in the assays used may have contributed to the different results 
obtained. Difference might also be due to the limited sample sizes. In addition, in one vaccinated 
participant of protocol version 3.0, 331284 copies/mL of vaccine virus were detected on Day 7. This was 
classified as anomalous by the MAH. It is however noted that this higher value is observed for a child of 9 
years of age (and not an adolescent, as observed for study V920-007). 
The proposed statement in SmPC section 4.4. related to viremia and viral shedding with the changes 
proposed is accepted. However, a special warning was added for parents or caregivers of young vaccinees 
to minimise exposure to shed vaccine virus. See section 2.7 (update of the product information) to see 
the complete details on transmission and transmission to animals and livestock.  
Viral shedding/secondary transmission to close contacts, particularly immunocompromised hosts is an 
important potential risk in the RMP. The V920-015 ACHIV trial, conducted in Canada, Burkina Faso, and 
Senegal will study the safety and tolerability (including viral shedding) of V920 in HIV-positive adults and 
adolescents 13 to 70 years of age. Moreover, another trial, EBOLAPED (not specified in RMP), will 
evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP EBOV vaccine candidate in healthy 
children aged 1 to 12 years and in their adults and/or children relatives living in Lambaréné, Gabon. The 
available results on the shedding of EBOLAPED should be provided (REC). 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The overall safety profile in the paediatric population is in accordance with the safety data in adults after 
one dose of V920. No new safety signals were identified. 
In the V920 pooled group, in general the most common injection-site AE and systemic AE were reported 
within 7 days after vaccination and were mild to moderate in intensity. The safety profile in the different 
age categories was in general comparable apart from pyrexia, which was observed more frequently in the 
youngest age category (1 to 3 years of age). However, pyrexia was more frequent in the placebo arm in 
this population. 
The number of subjects in the age category from 1 to 3 years of age was rather limited: 41 children 
between 1 and 2 years of age and 54 children between 2 and 3 years of age vaccinated with V920 (total 
of 95 children 1-3 as expected), versus 23 children between 1 and 2 years of age and 37 children 
between 2 and 3 years of age vaccinated with placebo (total of 60 children 1-3 as expected).  
Recommendations (REC) are considered necessary to address issues related to safety (see section 3.8 – 
Conclusions).

V920-015 African-Canadian Study 
of HIV-Infected Adults and a 
Vaccine for Ebola (ACHIV-Ebola) 
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.3 of the SmPC have been 
updated. Changes related to SmPC sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.4 are summarised below (new text in bold and 
deleted text marked as strikethrough):  
      Section 4.1 
Ervebo is indicated for active immunisation of individuals 18 years of age or older to protect 
against Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) caused by Zaire Ebola virus (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). 
      Section 4.2 
Ervebo should be administered by a trained healthcare worker. 
Posology 
Individuals 18 years of age or older: one dose (1 mL) (see section 5.1). 
Booster dose 
The need and appropriate timing for a booster dose(s) has have not been established. 
Current available data are included in section 5.1.  
Paediatric population 
The posology in children 1 to 17 years of age is the same as in adults. sSafety, 
immunogenicity and efficacy of Ervebo in children aged less than 1 to 17 years of age have not 
yet been established (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). […] 
     Section 4.4 
[…] Duration of protection 
Vaccination with Ervebo may not result in protection in all vaccinees. Vaccine efficacy in adults 
has been established in the period ≥10 to ≤31 days after vaccination, however the duration of 
protection is not known (see section 5.1). […]

[…] In a Phase 1 study, vaccine viremia and Vviral shedding was were observed more 
frequently (28/39) in children and adolescents 6 to 17 years of age (28/39) compared to 
adults. In a subsequent Phase 2 study, 31.7% (19/60) of children and adolescents 1 to 
17 years of age enrolled in a shedding sub-study shed vaccine virus in saliva following 
vaccination. Viral shedding was observed more frequently on Day 7 and declined 
thereafter, with no shedding detected at Day 56.  
[…] Parents and caregivers of young vaccinees should observe careful hygiene 
especially when handling bodily waste and fluids for a minimum of 6 weeks after 
vaccination. Disposable nappies can be sealed in double plastic bags and disposed of in 
household waste. See section 5.3. 
Refer to the full PI for changes in sections 4.8, 5.1. and 5.3.  
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
The MAH took the opportunity to correct the prescription status to “Medicinal product subject to medical 
prescription” in the Annex II of the PI. Therefore, the restriction, mistakenly included at the time of the 
initial MA, is deleted. CHMP agreed with this correction.  
In addition, the list of local representatives in the package leaflet has been revised to amend contact 
details for the representative(s) of Germany and Italy.   
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report making reference to the currently approved package leaflet for Ervebo. The 
bridging report submitted by the MAH has been found acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
EVD is an acute systemic febrile syndrome caused by EBOV with case fatality ranging from 25% to 90%. 
EBOV is highly contagious and spreads through human-to-human transmission directly or indirectly via 
blood or body fluids (e.g., urine, saliva, sweat, faeces, vomit, breast milk, and semen) of living or dead 
infected persons, or any soiled material.  
While, historically, children have represented a small number of total cases of EVD, in recent outbreaks 
up to a quarter of cases have been in children. The largest outbreak, in West Africa, resulted in 28,616 
cases, of whom approximately 18–20% were children, with a reported mortality rate of 42–63% in 
children <18 years and of 73–86% in children <5 years. 
Younger children appear to have shorter mean incubation periods than adults and the disease also tends 
to have a shorter time course from symptom onset to hospitalisation and/or death compared to adults. 
The pathogenesis of EVD is characterised by an intense inflammatory process, impaired haemostasis, and 
capillary leaks, with mortality resulting from septic shock and multi-organ system failure. Initial signs and 
symptoms are nonspecific (e.g., fever, headache, myalgia, fatigue) and may mimic other more common 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/372877/2023 
Page 75/81 
 
 
 
 
 
conditions such as malaria. After a week, haemorrhagic manifestations can appear in more than half of 
the patients. EVD progresses with gastrointestinal symptoms, internal and external bleeding, and in some 
cases, rash, and neurologic involvement. The varying spectrum of EVD severity is increasingly described.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Treatments 
Treatment consists primarily of supportive therapy and is less than ideally effective, with case fatality 
rates remaining high even with intensive supportive care. The US FDA approved 2 monoclonal antibody 
therapies, REGN-EB3 (Inmazeb) in Oct-2020 and ansuvimab (Ebanga) in Dec-2020, for the treatment of 
infection caused by ZEBOV in adult and paediatric subjects. There are currently no specific approved 
medical interventions licensed to treat EVD in the EU.   
Results from the PALM Phase 2/3 study showed a lower incidence in mortality at 28 days (primary 
endpoint). Nonetheless, 34% and 67% of patients with higher viral loads who received ansuvimab and 
REGN-EB3, respectively, in the study died and there remains an unmet medical need for more efficacious 
interventions. 
Other vaccines 
Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo, also known as Zabdeno and Mvabea, respectively, is a 2-component 
vaccine regimen that was authorised under exceptional circumstances in the EU on 01-Jul-2020 and 
prequalified by the WHO for the prevention of disease caused by ZEBOV in individuals 1 year of age and 
older. Ad26.ZEBOV is administered first followed by MVA-BN-Filo approximately 8 weeks later as a 
booster. Clinical studies demonstrated that Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo is safe and elicits strong 
neutralising and non-neutralising antibody responses; however, protective efficacy against EVD in 
humans has not been demonstrated. 
Unmet medical need 
EVD affects both adults and children. Younger children appear to have shorter mean incubation periods 
than adults, and the disease tends to have a shorter time course from symptom onset to hospitalisation 
and/or death compared to adults. Children < 5 years of age are especially vulnerable to EVD, with a 
reported mortality rate of 73-86% during the outbreak in West Africa from 2013 to 2016.  
Only one prophylactic vaccine is available for preventing EVD in the paediatric population but the need for 
more than one dose and 2-month interval between doses make this vaccine regimen less suitable for an 
outbreak response in which immediate protection is necessary. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical study 
The main clinical study is the V920-016 (PREVAC). The characteristics of this study are summarised in 
table 1 of section 2.3.1 (Clinical aspects introduction).   
3.2.  Favourable effects 
V920 induces an increase in both neutralising and binding antibody titers against the vaccine virus and 
ZEBOV-GP, respectively, when compared to baseline, both in children and adults. Higher antibody titers 
than baseline values were observed up to 1-year post-vaccination. 
The superiority of Day 28 and Month 12 GP-ELISA GMT in children 1 to 17 years of age vaccinated with 1 
dose of V920 as compared with placebo was demonstrated, with a lower bound of the 2 sided 95% CI for 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/372877/2023 
Page 76/81 
 
 
 
 
 
GMTR >1. Higher immune responses at Day 28 and Month 12 were also achieved for subgroup analyses 
by child age group, sex, and baseline serostatus. 
Superior immune responses at 12 months were also achieved after 2 doses of V920 compared with 
placebo. However, humoral responses measured at Month 12 indicate that comparable responses were 
induced in participants randomised to 1 dose of V920 as compared to 2 doses of V920 at this later time-
point. 
The non-inferiority of the Day 28 GP-ELISA GMT in children (1-17 or 3-17 years of age) as compared to 
adults was demonstrated (lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI greater than 0.67). Comparable immune 
responses at Day 28 were also achieved for subgroup analyses by sex, and baseline serostatus. 
Seroresponse rates defined as a 2-fold increase from baseline and ≥200 EU/mL for GP-ELISA were high 
(>94%) at any time post-vaccination, and the majority (>85%) had a seroresponse defined as ≥4-fold 
increase from baseline. The proportions of participants with a GP-ELISA seroresponse defined as ≥4-fold 
increase from baseline were generally higher for children as compared to adults in the V920 groups at all 
time-points after vaccination. Most (>95%) children vaccinated with V920 had a PRNT seroresponse 
defined as ≥4-fold increase from baseline at any time post-vaccination. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Clinical efficacy of V920 was not assessed in children and adolescents. Clinical efficacy of V920 was 
assessed in adults, in the ring vaccination study (Protocol 010). Vaccine efficacy was 100% (unadjusted 
95% CI: 63.5% to 100%; 95% CI adjusted for multiplicity: 14.4% to 100%) (0 cases in the immediate 
arm; 10 cases in 4 rings in the delayed arm). Vaccine efficacy was only demonstrated in the period ≥10 
to ≤31 days after vaccination. Uncertainties remain as to the actual level of protection, the duration of 
protection and the type of protection (pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis) given the methodological 
peculiarities of the ring vaccination design and the fact that the study was conducted during a declining 
Ebola epidemic.  
It is currently not known if V920 protects against other EVD causing viruses. 
The number of children and adolescents included in each age strata are limited, in particular children < 3 
years. If considering the 1 dose V920 group only (as currently reflected in the SmPC), less than 50 
children contributed to the Day 28 and Month 12 GP-ELISA and PRNT subgroup analyses. Immunogenicity 
data from ongoing trials are needed to confirm the level of immune responses induced by V920, in 
particular for the children <3 years of age. A better characterisation of the immune responses of V920 is 
also expected from the ongoing trials (kinetic, breath, booster response). 
The immunogenicity data indicate a sustainable humoral immune response induced by V920 through one 
year, with antibody titers lower than at Day 28 but still higher than at pre-vaccination timepoint. The 
clinical relevance is unknown because of a lack of an ICP.  
Long-term immunogenicity and the need/optimal timepoint for a booster dose are currently unknown. 
No cell-mediated immunity data after vaccination in children are currently available. 
There are no data on co-administration with other vaccines, hence co-administration is not 
recommended. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In children and adolescents 1 to 17 years of age (in the V920 pooled group), the most common injection-
site AE reported following vaccination with Ervebo were injection site pain (41.6%), injection-site pruritus 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/372877/2023 
Page 77/81 
 
 
 
 
 
(4.1%), injection-site swelling (3.0%) and injection-site erythema (0.5%). The most common systemic 
AE (>7%) were pyrexia (62.2%), headache (45.7%), somnolence, reduced activity, fatigue (23.5%), 
decreased appetite (23.4%), abdominal pain (16.3%), myalgia (15.8%), chills (14.5%), dizziness 
(9.9%), vomiting (9.5%), and nausea (7.1%). In general, these reactions were reported within 7 days 
after vaccination and were mild to moderate in intensity. 
The safety profile in the different age categories was in general comparable apart from pyrexia which was 
observed more frequently in the youngest age category (1 to 3 years of age). However, pyrexia was more 
frequent in the placebo arm in this population. 
The proportions of children and adults who experienced an SAE were low and comparable for the pooled 
V920 and placebo groups from the first vaccination to the end of the base study.  
Five children (3 in the 1-dose V920 group, 2 in the placebo group) and 4 adults (3 in the 1 dose V920 
group, 1 in the placebo group) died during the study.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The number of subjects in the age category from 1 to 3 years of age is rather limited. All safety data for 
the children vaccinated with V920 such as the long-term follow up of V920-016 (Protocol Version 5.0), 
studies V920-014 (CSR expected in 2024) and V920-015 (CSR expected in 2024), and the data set 
presented to SAGE by WHO, should be provided as soon as available.  
With protocol version 3.0 (supportive data), there were only 10 children aged <3 years vaccinated with 
V920 (8 in the 1 dose group, and 2 in the 2-dose group).  
Viral shedding/secondary transmission to close contacts, particularly immunocompromised hosts, is an 
important potential risk in the RMP.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Although there are no established immunological correlates of protection, the demonstration of (at least) 
comparable humoral immune responses (both GP-ELISA and PRNT) in children versus adults is deemed 
appropriate to reasonably assume a benefit of V920 in protecting children. The actual level of protection 
is unknown as well as the duration of protection. 
The unfavourable effects that were identified in the paediatric population were in accordance with what 
was seen in adults.  
The safety profile in the different age categories is in general comparable apart from pyrexia which was 
observed more frequently in the youngest age category (1 to 3 years of age). However, pyrexia was also 
more frequent in the placebo arm in this population. 
The number of subjects <3 years of age was limited but deemed acceptable to support the requested 
extension of indication given that children <5 years of age are especially vulnerable to EVD, with a 
reported mortality rate of 73-86% during the outbreak in West Africa from 2013 to 2016. In addition, the 
use of V920 within the European context is considered to be very specific, i.e., mainly Health Care 
Workers.

Safety and immunogenicity data from the 5-years ongoing follow-up of V920-016 and from ongoing trials 
(V920-014 and V920-015) are requested to be submitted as available. Effectiveness and safety data for 
the paediatric population of the V920-EAP5 study (included in the RMP) are also to be provided. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The immunogenicity of 1 dose of V920 was shown to be (at least) comparable in children 1 to 17 years of 
age and in adults, which shows a benefit of V920 in protecting children. 
The overall safety profile in the paediatric population (from 1 to 17 years of age) is in accordance with the 
safety data in adults after 1 dose of V920. No new safety signal was identified. 
The number of subjects in the age category from 1 to 3 years of age is rather limited but deemed 
acceptable to support the requested extension of indication. The safety and immunogenicity profiles will 
be further confirmed with the results of ongoing studies. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Ervebo in the sought after indication is positive.  
The following measures are considered necessary to address issues related to immunogenicity and safety: 
Recommendation (REC):  
•  REC 1: Results of the long-term follow up of PREVAC/V920-016 (Protocol Version 5.0) should be 
submitted as soon as available. 
•  REC 2: Results of V920-014 (CSR expected in 2024) should be submitted as soon as available. 
•  REC 3: Results of V920-015 (CSR expected in 2024) should be submitted as soon as available. 
•  REC 4: Analysis of safety data set presented to SAGE by WHO (March 2021) should be submitted 
as soon as available. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends, by consensus, the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, 
concerning the following change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I, II and IIIB 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
Extension of indication to include the paediatric population from 1 year to less than 18 years of age based 
on final results from study V920-016 (PREVAC); this is a phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled study of 2 leading Ebola vaccine candidates (Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo and V920) and 3 
vaccine strategies (Ad26.ZEBOV/MVABN-Filo, 1-dose V920, and 2 dose V920) to evaluate immunogenicity 
and safety in healthy children and adolescents from 1 to 17 years of age and adults 18 years of age and

older. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, and 5.3 of the SmPC are updated.  
The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance.  
Version 2.0 of the RMP has also been approved.  
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the Annex II and the list of local representatives in 
the Package Leaflet. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I, II and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
This recommendation is subject to the following amended condition: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription.

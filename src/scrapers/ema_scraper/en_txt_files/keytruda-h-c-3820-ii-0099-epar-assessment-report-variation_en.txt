Epidemiology  
Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer mortality in women. In Europe, 
the expected number of new cases and deaths from breast cancer is 522,500 and 137,700, respectively1. 
TNBC represents 15% to 20% of all breast cancers2.  
Biologic features 
TNBC is phenotypically defined by a lack of ER and PgR expression and the absence of HER2 
overexpression and/or amplification4 3. TNBC is overlapping, but not synonymous, with the basal-like 
subtype defined by gene expression, as about 70% of TNBCs have basal-like characteristics according to 
gene-expression profiling4. TNBC is a heterogeneous entity that encompasses several subtypes with 
distinct molecular characteristics (basal-like 1 and 2, mesenchymal, mesenchymal stem-like, 
immunomodulatory, luminal androgen receptor)5. Actionable somatic mutations are generally low-
frequency events in TNBC6. TNBCs are significantly associated with BRCA1-germline mutations and high 
levels of genomic instability, TP53 (82%) and PIK3CA (10%) being the two most frequently mutated 
somatic genes7. Approximately 15% of subjects with TNBC carry deleterious BRCA mutations8. 
TNBC is characterized by the presence of TILs and gene signatures enriched for cytotoxic CD8+ T cell and 
NKC activity, suggesting that this cancer subtype may be an immunoreactive disease and may be 
amenable to immune modulation of the tumor microenvironment9. Published studies report PD-L1 
positivity ranging from 20% to 60% in all breast cancers10 11, which have been associated to good or bad 
prognosis in different studies12. In addition, PD-L1 positivity in breast cancer is often associated with TILs 
or TIL activity9 and the presence of other immune regulators13, although there is a noteworthy 
heterogeneity between breast tumors even within the same molecular subtype14. 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
TNBC occur more frequently in younger patients and it is associated with higher tumor grade at 
diagnosis, a higher risk of distant disease recurrence, occurring earlier with a peak of recurrence within 1

to 3 years after initial diagnosis, more likely develop of visceral and CNS metastases, and poorer OS 
compared to other breast cancer subtypes15. 
Management 
Treatment of TNBC is challenging, as these tumors lack therapeutic targets, such as ER and HER2. 
Chemotherapy is considered the standard of care, although become rapidly resistant to chemotherapy 
upon local recurrence and/or metastasis, even though they are often sensitive to cytotoxic drugs at initial 
presentation5.  
When KEYNOTE-355 started in 2016, recommendations for advanced TNBC included sequential 
monotherapy as the preferred choice, reserving combination chemotherapy to patients with rapid clinical 
progression, life-threatening visceral metastases, or need for rapid symptom and/or disease control. 
Anthracyclines and taxanes were the preferred option. Anthracyclines and taxanes were also suggested 
as rechallenge regimens in patients with 6–12 months of disease free survival following completion of 
neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy, whichever was completed last. In patients with advanced HER2- 
negative breast cancer, who were pre-treated in the adjuvant or metastatic setting with anthracycline and 
taxane and not in need of combination chemotherapy, single agent capecitabine, vinorelbine or eribulin 
were possible choices. As TNBC was a putatively BRCA-deficient population, platinum doublets were 
studied with some evidence of activity16 17.  
According to the latest European treatment guidelines18, for most patients with advanced TNBC, 
chemotherapy remains the only available non-investigational systemic treatment option for non-BRCA-
mutated, with no specific recommendations regarding types of agents, with the possible exception of 
platinum compounds for patients with BRCA-mutated.  
Based on the results of IMpassion130 study, atezolizumab in combination with nab-paclitaxel may be 
considered an option in the 1L setting for de-novo advanced/metastatic disease or disease that has 
developed at least 12 months after completion of (neo)adjuvant ChT in tumours that have PD-L1 
expression≥1% on immune cells. This treatment was approved in EU in 2019 based on PFS advantage 
[updated PFS analysis in PD-L1 positive population: median PFS 7.46 (95%CI 6.7, 9.23) vs 5.29 (95%CI 
3.81, 5.55), HR 0.63 (95%CI 0.5, 0.8), p<0.0001] and positive OS trend [not formally tested; median 
OS in the PD-L1 positive population 25.03 (95%CI 19.55, 30.65) vs 17.97 months (95%CI 13.63, 20.07), 
HR 0.71 (95%CI 0.54, 0.93)]19.  
In contrast, atezolizumab + paclitaxel did not improve PFS or OS in participants with a recurrence-free 
interval of ≥12 months and PD-L1 positive tumors (IC ≥1%) enrolled in IMpassion131. 
In patients with germline BRCA mutation, a PARP inhibitor is a preferred treatment option. Olaparib and 
talazoparib were approved in EU in 2019 for the treatment of germline BRCA1/2-mutations HER2 
negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer; patients should have been previously treated with 
an anthracycline and a taxane in the (neo)adjuvant or metastatic setting unless not suitable for these 
treatments.

Table: Efficacy of Chemotherapy as 1L Treatment for mTNBC  
Table from KEYNOTE-355 study protocol  
2.1.2.  About the product 
Keytruda (pembrolizumab) is a humanized mAb IgG4/kappa isotype directed against PD-1. By blocking 
the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands PD-L1/2, pembrolizumab enhances T cell lymphocyte activity 
with consequent stimulation of the immune-mediated anti-tumour activity. Pembrolizumab also 
modulates the level of IL-2, TNFα, IFNγ, and other cytokines. The antibody potentiates existing immune 
responses in the presence of antigen only; it does not non-specifically activate T cells. 
Pembrolizumab is currently EU approved as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy or other 
agents for the treatment of melanoma, NSCLC, RCC, HNSCC, urothelial cancer, cHL and MSI-H mCRC.  
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The MAH for Keytruda applied for an extension of indication of pembrolizumab in combination with 
chemotherapy for the 1L treatment of patients with locally recurrent unresectable or metastatic TNBC 
whose tumors express PD-L1 (CPS ≥10). This application is based on the efficacy and safety results of 
IA2 (data cutoff date 11-DEC-2019) of the pivotal phase III double-blind randomized KEYNOTE-355 study 
which evaluated pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy compared with placebo plus chemotherapy as 
treatment for locally recurrent inoperable or metastatic TNBC who had recurrence-free interval of ≥6 
months from completion of treatment with curative intent. In both arms, chemotherapy was a physician’s 
choice between paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel, or gemcitabine plus carboplatin. During the procedure, the MAH 
submitted also the results of the final analysis for overall survival of KEYNOTE-355 (data cut-off date 15-
JUN-2021). 
No scientific advice was requested to CHMP on the design of the pivotal study KEYNOTE-355, which was 
obtained from the US FDA. A pre-submission TC meeting was held with Rapporteurs and EMA on 26 
October 2020 regarding content and format of the submission.

2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The MAH stated that all studies were conducted according to current standard research approaches and 
following appropriate GCP standards and considerations for the ethical treatment of human participants 
that were in place at the time the studies were performed. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
According to the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00) proteins are exempted from the submission of ERA studies because they are 
unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. Pembrolizumab is a protein, therefore an ERA has 
not been submitted by the MAH. This is acceptable. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Comprehensive review of the key clinical pharmacology findings for pembrolizumab as monotherapy (200 
mg Q3W dosing regimen) from melanoma, NSCLC, HNSCC, HL, UC, GEJ adenocarcinoma, HCC, MSI-H 
mCRC and HL indications have been discussed extensively in previous submissions. The key clinical 
pharmacology characteristics are summarized in the SmPC. 
Absorption 
Pembrolizumab is dosed via the intravenous route and therefore is immediately and completely 
bioavailable. 
Distribution 
Consistent with a limited extravascular distribution, the volume of distribution of pembrolizumab at 
steady state is small (6.0 L; coefficient of variation [CV]: 20%). As expected for an antibody, 
pembrolizumab does not bind to plasma proteins in a specific manner. 
Elimination 
Pembrolizumab CL is approximately 23% lower (geometric mean, 195 mL/day [CV%: 40%]) after 
achieving maximal change at steady state compared with the first dose (252 mL/day [CV%: 37%]); this 
decrease in CL with time is not considered clinically meaningful. The geometric mean value (CV%) for the 
terminal half-life is 22 days (32%) at steady-state. 
Pharmacokinetic in target population 
A substantial characterization of the key clinical pharmacology and immunogenicity findings of 
pembrolizumab as monotherapy has been provided in previous submissions. 
The updated clinical pharmacology results pertaining to the current submission include: 
• 
PK data from subjects with from subjects with previously untreated locally recurrent inoperable or 
metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) (KEYNOTE-355) 
•  A comparison of KEYNOTE-355 observed PK data with reference model (TDPK) predicted PK. 
•  A comparison of KEYNOTE-355 observed PK concentrations with observed PK concentrations from 
subjects from historical data. 
Pembrolizumab PK data from KEYNOTE-355 study 
PK samples with a 15-June-2020 visit cut-off date were measured for a total of 221 subjects in KEYNOTE-
355. The PK analysis dataset was constructed from the final locked SDTM datasets using SAS version 9.4 
and contains observed MK-3475 serum concentrations and actual elapsed blood sampling times relative 
to the corresponding time of dose. 
Summary statistics were calculated based on nominal time after first dose. Safety follow up and 
discontinuation visits, as well as PK results from subjects dosed with placebo instead of pembrolizumab 
were omitted from the PK analysis.

concentrations (Ctrough) were obtained within 24 hours prior to dosing at Cycle 1, 2, 4, and 8 and every 
8 cycles (6 months) thereafter. 
PK samples were also collected at discontinuation and at 30 days after discontinuation of trial treatment. 
Phoenix™ WinNonlin® (Version 8.1.0.3530) software was used for pharmacokinetic analysis. 
RESULTS 
Individual predose serum pembrolizumab concentration-time profiles with mean ± SE profile overlaid are 
shown in [Figure 1], mean predose serum pembrolizumab concentration-time profile is shown in [Figure

Over the course of clinical development of pembrolizumab, PK has been robustly characterized. Using a 
dataset with sample size of 2993 participants, a time-dependent PK model was created to describe the PK 
profile as indicated in the USPI and EU SmPC. This model is used as the reference PK model to support 
pembrolizumab submissions across indications worldwide. 
Observed pembrolizumab concentration data in KEYNOTE-355 for pembrolizumab + Chemotherapy group 
are overlaid on the simulated profile using the reference PK model as shown in [Figure 3]. While the 
majority of the observed serum concentration values in KEYNOTE-355 are above the median of the 
predicted interval, most are contained within the boundaries of the predicted interval using the reference 
PK model.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
KEYTRUDA is an antibody that binds to the programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor and blocks its 
interaction with ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. The PD-1 receptor is a negative regulator of T-cell activity that 
has been shown to be involved in the control of T-cell immune responses. KEYTRUDA potentiates T-cell 
responses, including anti-tumour responses, through blockade of PD-1 binding to PD-L1 and PD-L2, which 
are expressed in antigen presenting cells and may be expressed by tumours or other cells in the tumour 
microenvironment. 
Dose regimen 
Pembrolizumab is approved at a 2 mg/kg or 200 mg Q3W dosing regimen for multiple indications as 
monotherapy and in combination with small molecule or chemotherapy worldwide (e.g., melanoma, 
NSCLC, HNSCC, HL, UC, gastric cancer, MSI-H cancer, HCC and RCC). 
Pembrolizumab is also approved at 400 mg Q6W in the EU for monotherapy and combination indications. 
A dosing regimen of 200 mg Q3W or 400 mg Q6W is recommended for pembrolizumab in the treatment 
of adult subjects with TNBC in combination with chemotherapy. The 200 mg Q3W dosing regimen is 
approved for use in multiple indications globally as monotherapy as well as in combination with small 
molecule or chemotherapy based on a large, integrated body of evidence at this dose level across 
indications. 
2.3.4.   PK/PD modelling 
No new information regarding PK/PD modelling for pembrolizumab is available within this extension of 
indication. 
Immunogenicity 
The existing immunogenicity assessment for pembrolizumab for the monotherapy setting is based on a 
sufficiently large dataset of patients across several indications, with very low observed rates of total 
treatment ADA across different pembrolizumab regimens (1.4 – 3.8%) as well as of neutralizing 
antibodies (0.4 – 1.6%). This analysis has not demonstrated impact on efficacy or safety, as currently 
summarized in the SmPC. This low rate of immunogenicity has been shown to be consistent across tumor 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/563896/2021 
Page 19/163 
 
 
 
 
 
type and no clinically meaningful consequences have been observed in the subjects with a positive 
immunogenicity reading. Based on the existing robust characterization of immunogenicity potential, 
alignment has been obtained with the US FDA and EMA that the current assessment of immunogenicity 
for pembrolizumab is adequate for non-adjuvant monotherapy settings. 
No new ADA data are provided in this submission based on the robust characterization of immunogenicity 
potential with trials in non-adjuvant monotherapy setting. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Clinical pharmacology results in support of the current extension of indication of pembrolizumab in 
combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of locally recurrent inoperable or metastatic TNBC 
derive from study KEYNOTE-355. Data were collected on a total of 221 subjects with a visit cut-off date of 
15-June-2020. 
The MAH presented a descriptive PK analysis based on predose pembrolizumab serum concentrations 
(Ctrough) obtained within 24 hours prior to dosing at Cycles 1, 2, 4, 8 and every 8 cycles (6 months) 
thereafter. The observed pembrolizumab serum concentration values at cycle 2 and cycle 8 are consistent 
with other globally approved studies in different cancer indications. 
A comparison was conducted between the observed PK of pembrolizumab for the current indication and 
the predictions from the reference PK model developed with pembrolizumab monotherapy data 
(KEYNOTE-001, -002, -006, -010, and -024). The observed concentrations in patients with 
advanced/metastatic TNBC with Pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W generally fall within the 90% CI of the 
model predicted median concentration, both after first dose and at steady state. 
In a comparative exercise with prior conducted clinical studies of pembrolizumab in monotherapy, the PK 
data at both Cycle 2 and Cycle 8 from KEYNOTE-355 show consistency with the established PK profile 
observed across the different clinical settings for which approval has been granted. Similarity in PK profile 
between KEYNOTE-355 and other clinical trials has also been confirmed in an analysis restricted to female 
subjects only. 
Overall, the PK in participants with metastatic TNBC in KEYNOTE-355 after combination therapy of 
pembrolizumab with chemotherapy is generally consistent with monotherapy PK, as previously 
established. This refers also to the comparison of female patients only. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of pembrolizumab has been sufficiently investigated for the 
extension of the indication of pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks in combination with chemotherapy 
for the treatment of TNBC. The PK profile that emerges from KEYNOTE-355 testing pembrolizumab 200 
mg Q3W in combination with chemotherapy in patients with locally recurrent inoperable or metastatic 
TNBC is consistent with the established pharmacology of pembrolizumab as observed across different 
cancer subtypes.

2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
No specific dose response study have been performed. Pembrolizumab dose and regimen used in the 
pivotal KEYNOTE-355 study 200 mg Q3W IV is one of the dosages currently approved in combination with 
chemotherapy for other indications (NSCLC, HNSCC). 
2.4.2.  Main study 
A Randomized, Double-Blind, Phase III Study of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) 
plus Chemotherapy vs Placebo plus Chemotherapy for Previously Untreated 
Locally Recurrent Inoperable or Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer – 
(KEYNOTE-355) 
The study included 2 parts: 
•  Part 1 – safety run-in: unblinded, open-label, safety run-in that monitored participants (N=35) for 
unacceptable toxicities to study treatment (pembrolizumab + chemotherapy). Participants were 
assigned by forced randomization to ensure at least 10 participants were included in each treatment 
group (pembrolizumab + gemcitabine/carboplatin or pembrolizumab + taxane [paclitaxel or nab-
paclitaxel]). 
•  Part 2 – phase 3 study: double-blind, placebo-controlled study on a background of chemotherapy, 
with 847 eligible participants randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive pembrolizumab + 
chemotherapy or placebo + chemotherapy, respectively.  
The efficacy data are based on Part 2 results (all data described in the efficacy section below 
are related to Part 2).

Outcomes/endpoints 
The dual primary endpoints, evaluated for all participants and for those participants whose tumors 
express PD-L1 (CPS≥1 and CPS≥10), were the following:  
• 
PFS, defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression as 
measured by BICR per RECIST 1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. 
•  OS, defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. 
Secondary efficacy and PRO endpoints, evaluated for all participants and for those participants whose 
tumors express PD-L1 (CPS≥1 and CPS≥10), were as follows: 
•  ORR, defined as the proportion of participants in the analysis population who had a response (CR or 
PR) as measured by BICR per RECIST 1.1. 
•  DOR, defined as the time from the first documented evidence of CR or PR until disease progression as 
measured by BICR per RECIST 1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. 
•  DCR, defined as the percentage of participants who had achieved CR or PR or had demonstrated SD 
for at least 24 weeks, as measured by BICR per RECIST 1.1. 
•  QoL, defined as changes from baseline using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ BR23 
questionnaires. 
Imaging assessment: 
Tumor imaging were acquired by computed tomography (CT, strongly preferred). Brain imaging (MRI 
preferred) was required at screening and during the study for subjects with known brain metastases and 
those with worsening and/or new neurological symptoms. A bone scan was required prior to study entry if 
a subject had a history of bone metastases and/or suggestive symptoms/signs, and during the study if 
clinically indicated or if the site believed a subject attained a CR.  
Baseline tumor imaging were performed during the 28-day screening window prior to randomization to 
confirm measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1 as assessed by local radiology review, then submitted 
to central imaging vendor (CIV) for retrospective review. Post-baseline imaging assessments were be 
performed at 8, 16, and 24 weeks post randomization, and then every 9 weeks during the first year. After 
1 year, imaging were performed every 12 weeks. Imaging were not discontinued until PD verified by CIV 
or start of new anti-cancer treatment, consent withdrawal, death, or end of study, whichever occurs first.  
RECIST 1.1 were applied by local radiology for assessing subject eligibility and by CIV as the primary 
measure for assessing efficacy parameters, allowing a maximum of 10 target lesions in total and 5 per 
organ. irRECIST, adapted to account for the unique tumor response seen with immunotherapeutic drugs, 
were used by site/investigator to assess tumor response and make treatment decisions both before and 
after PD is verified by CIV. 
Based on RECIST 1.1, PRs and CRs were confirmed by repeat tumor imaging studies at ≥4 weeks from 
the date response was first documented.  
Site/investigator-assessed first radiologic evidence of PD was also evaluated by the CIV in real time, and 
the results of central imaging review were expeditiously communicated to the study site and the Sponsor. 
Imaging flow algorithm for verification of PD by CIV for clinically stable subjects is illustrated in figure 
below.

Sample size 
Part 1: Approximately 30 subjects will be enrolled. 
Part 2: It was expected that ~ 664 OS events among all subjects, ~ 482 OS events among subjects with 
CPS ≥1, and ~ 240 OS events among subjects with CPS ≥10 have been observed at the FA. The planned 
sample size was approximately 828 subjects:  
(1) PFS in all subjects: at IA2 the analysis has ~ 89% power at a one-sided 0.111% alpha level, if the 
true HR is 0.70. At IA2, with ~ 634 events the HR at boundary for success is ~ 0.77 (~ 1.6 months 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/563896/2021 
Page 26/163 
 
 
 
 
 
 
improvement over control median PFS of 5.5 months). At IA2, PFS in all subjects can only be tested if 
both hypotheses of PFS in subjects with CPS ≥10 and PFS in subjects with CPS ≥1 are supported. 
(2) PFS in subjects with CPS ≥1: at IA2 the analysis has ~ 97% power at a one-sided 0.111% alpha level, 
if the true HR is 0.62. At IA2, with ~ 463 events the HR at boundary for success is ~ 0.74 (~ 1.9 months 
improvement over control median PFS of 5.5 months). At IA2, PFS in all subjects with CPS ≥1 can only be 
tested if the hypothesis of PFS in subjects with CPS ≥10 is supported.  
(3) PFS in subjects with CPS ≥10: at IA2 the analysis has ~ 86% power at a one-sided 0.411% alpha 
level, if the true HR is 0.60. At IA2, with ~ 235 events the HR at boundary for success is ~ 0.69 (~ 2.4 
months improvement over control median PFS of 5.5 months).  
(4) OS in all subjects: the trial has ~ 60% power at a one-sided 0.75% alpha level, if the true HR is 0.80. 
With ~ 664 events, the HR at boundary for success at FA is ~ 0.81 (~ 4.0 months improvement over 
control median OS of 17.5 months). After IA1, OS in all subjects can be tested if hypothesis of OS in 
subjects with CPS ≥1 is supported.  
(5) OS in subjects with CPS ≥1: the trial has ~ 87% power at a one-sided 0.75% alpha level, if the true 
HR is 0.71. With ~ 482 events, the HR at boundary for success at FA is ~ 0.78 (~ 4.8 months 
improvement over control median OS of 17.5 months).  
(6) OS in subjects with CPS ≥10: the trial has ~ 79% power at a one-sided 1.011% alpha level, if the true 
HR is 0.65. With ~ 240 events, the HR at boundary for success at FA is ~ 0.72 (~ 6.8 months 
improvement over control median OS of 17.5 months). 
Randomisation 
Treatment allocation/randomization occurred centrally using an interactive voice response system / 
integrated web response system (IVRS/IWRS). 
Part 1 used partial randomization with forced allocation depending on prior (neo)adjuvant treatment and 
disease-free interval, to stop enrollment into a specific treatment once ≥10 subjects are enrolled in that 
treatment. 
In Part 2 randomization was stratified for: 
• 
• 
chemotherapy on study (paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel vs gemcitabine/carboplatin),  
tumor programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) status (combined positive score [CPS]≥1 vs CPS <1),  
•  prior treatment with same class of chemotherapy in the (neo)adjuvant setting (yes vs no). 
Blinding (masking) 
Part 1 was open label. 
Part 2 was double-blinded. Details regarding trial blinding/unblinding including unblinding required for 
operational purposes (e.g., unblinded pharmacist) were described in Protocol and Statistical analysis plan. 
Statistical methods 
Part 1 and part 2 were planned to be analysed separately. 
Part 1: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/563896/2021 
Page 27/163 
 
 
 
 
The efficacy population were all subjects as treated (ASaT), who received at least one dose of study 
treatment. Patients were analysed in the treatment group correspondingly to the study treatment they 
actually received. The primary objective of safety and tolerability were addressed by performing 
descriptive summary statistics for safety endpoints by treatment. One interim analysis was planned for 
safety evaluation after the last subject have completed the first 21 or 28 days of study treatment, which 
was approximately 3 months after the first subject randomized reviewed by the DMC. Continuous safety 
monitoring were performed by the study team. No multiplicity correction was performed. Efficacy 
endpoints were secondary endpoints and analysed descriptively. 
Part 2: 
There are three planned interim analyses (IA) in addition to the final analysis for this study. The trial 
continues until the number of death is approximately equal to the targeted number for the final analysis, 
irrespective of the outcome from the interim analyses. The analyses planned, endpoints evaluated, and 
drivers of timing are summarized in the table below.

Final OS 
IA2 was performed after approximately 185 OS events had been observed among participants with PD-L1 
positive tumors (CPS≥10). A multiplicity strategy was applied to the 6 primary hypotheses (superiority of 
pembrolizumab + chemotherapy with respect to PFS and OS in All Participants, and in the PD-L1 positive 
subgroups [CPS≥1 and CPS≥10]), and the 2 secondary hypotheses of superiority of pembrolizumab + 
chemotherapy in ORR in All Participants and in the PD-L1 positive subgroup (CPS≥1). The family-wise 
Type-I error rate over the 6 primary hypotheses and 2 secondary hypotheses was strongly controlled at 
2.5% (1-sided). The OS hypotheses were tested following a group sequential approach, with 3 IAs and a 
final analysis planned. The PFS hypotheses were tested with an interim analysis performed at IA1 and a 
final analysis at IA2. The ORR hypotheses were tested with a single analysis each at IA1.  
Based on emerging biomarker data external to this study, the initial alpha allocation among the 6 primary 
hypotheses and 2 secondary hypotheses was revised in Protocol Amendment 05. The revision of the alpha

allocation occurs after the conduct of efficacy IA1. The family-wise Type-I error rate for this study was 
strongly controlled at 2.5% (one-sided) across all 6 primary hypotheses on PFS and OS as well as 2 
secondary hypotheses on ORR. Figure below displays the revised multiplicity strategy diagram of the 
study. The initial one-sided alpha allocation for each hypothesis is shown in the rectangle representing 
the hypothesis. The weights for re-allocation from each hypothesis to the others are represented in the 
numbers along the lines connecting hypotheses. Overall, a total of 0.5% alpha was allocated to PFS 
endpoints, a total of 1.8% alpha was allocated to OS endpoints, and a total of 0.2% alpha was allocated 
to ORR endpoints.  
Figure: multiplicity strategy (protocol 05) 
a)  Nominal  alpha  for  testing  will  be  calculated  based  on  Spiessens  and  Debois  method  accounting  for  correlation  between  ORR  in  all 
subjects and ORR in subjects with CPS ≥1. Of note, while the nominal alpha will be calculated and used for testing, the allocated alpha 
(0.001) will be passed to H7 when applicable.  
b) H5 α=0.0075 which includes 0.00036 already spent at IA1. Note: The shaded boxes in this figure represent alpha that has already 
been spent at IA1 and will be considered lost for future analyses. These alphas will no longer be re-allocated to other hypotheses under 
the graphical approach, nor can they be used to account for correlation among group sequential tests within each endpoint across different 
time points.  
The study uses the graphical method of Maurer and Bretz to control multiplicity for multiple hypotheses 
as well as interim analyses. According to this approach, study hypotheses may be tested more than once, 
and when a particular null hypothesis is rejected, the alpha allocated to that hypothesis can be 
reallocated to other hypothesis tests.  
The boundary properties for each of these alpha-levels for the OS interim analyses were derived using a 
Lan-DeMets O'Brien-Fleming spending function.  
Further details of statistical analyses were described in the SAP. 
The Part 2 ITT population served as the population for the primary efficacy analyses. All randomly 
assigned participants were included in this population. The efficacy analyses in this submission were 
based on IA2, which was the final analysis of PFS and second interim analysis for OS. Participants 
enrolled in Part 1 were excluded from the efficacy analyses. 
A summary of the analysis strategy for key efficacy endpoints is presented in the following table:

PRO analyses were based on the PRO FAS population, defined as all randomized participants who received 
at least 1 dose of study intervention and had completed at least 1 PRO assessment. Participants were 
included in the treatment arm to which they were randomly assigned in the PRO analyses. 
The safety analyses were based on the ASaT populations. 
The non-parametric Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the PFS and OS curve in each treatment 
group. The treatment difference in PFS and OS was assessed by the stratified log-rank test. For PFS and 
OS a stratified Cox proportional hazard model with Efron's method of tie handling was used to assess the 
magnitude of the treatment difference between the treatment arms. The hazard ratio and its 95% 
confidence interval from the stratified Cox model with Efron's method of tie handling and with a single 
treatment covariate was reported. The same stratification factors used for randomization were applied to 
both the stratified log-rank test and the stratified Cox model. The PFS and OS HRs were estimated for 
several subgroups based on baseline prognostic variables and demographic characteristics. 
In order to evaluate the robustness of the PFS endpoint per RECIST 1.1 by a blinded independent central 
imaging vendor, sensitivity analyses with a different set of censoring rules was applied. 
The stratified Miettinen and Nurminen method was used for the comparison of the ORR and DCR between 
the two treatment groups. The difference in ORR/DCR and its 95% confidence interval from the stratified 
Miettinen and Nurminen method with strata weighting by sample size with a single treatment covariate 
was reported. The stratification factors used for randomization were applied to the analysis.  
If sample size permits, it was planned to summarize DOR descriptively using Kaplan-Meier medians and 
quartiles. Only the subset of patients who show a complete response or partial response were to be 
included in this analysis. 
The analysis of safety results followed a tiered approach. There were no Tier 1 endpoints in this study, 
and Tier 2 parameters were assessed via point estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) provided 
for between-group comparisons; only point estimates by intervention arm were provided for Tier 3 safety 
parameters. The 95% CIs for the between-treatment differences in percentages were provided using the 
Miettinen and Nurminen method. 
Results 
Note: Efficacy analyses to support this extension of indication are based on the Part 2 ITT population (N = 
847). Participants enrolled in Part 1 (safety run-in; n=35) were excluded from the efficacy analyses. 
Therefore, the following sections are focused on the presentation of Part 2 results.

Recruitment 
This study was conducted at 251 centers in 29 countries. First subject in part 2 was randomized on 9-Jan 
2017, last subject randomized was on 12 Jun 2018.  
A total of 525 patients were not randomized due to screen failure, the most common being not having 
centrally confirmed TNBC (38%) and not having measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1 as determined 
by local radiology review (10.5%). About 7% of subjects were not included due to ECOG ≥2 and about 
6% due to symptomatic/unstable CNS disease. 
A total of 847 participants were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to pembrolizumab + chemotherapy (566 
participants) or placebo + chemotherapy (281 participants). Enrolment in Part 2 of the study was from 
09-JAN-2017 to 12-JUN-2018. 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments: a total of 5 protocol amendments were released. Main changes are summarised 
below:  
Original protocol (21-Apr-2016) 
Amendment 1 (06-Dec-2016) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/563896/2021 
Page 34/163 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Update  of  pneumonitis  exclusion  criterion  and  permanent  discontinuation  of  subjects  with  Grade  2 
pneumonitis 
•  Clarifications  regarding  visit  schedule,  review  of  safety  labs  and  washout  period  for  prior  radiation 
therapy 
•  Clarification  that  adjuvant  radiation  therapy  is  not  considered  treatment  with  curative  intent  for  the 
purpose of calculating the ≥6 month interval requirement between completion of surgery or adjuvant 
chemotherapy  (whichever  occurred  last)  and  first  disease  recurrence.  Therefore,  a  subject  who  was 
treated  with  adjuvant  radiation  therapy  within  the  6-month  interval  requirement  may  be  eligible  for 
study participation. 
Amendment 2 (05-Feb-2018) 
•  Added guidelines for dose modification in the event of myocarditis and updated guidelines for several 
other conditions to align with the most current label and safety information for pembrolizumab. 
•  Clarification regarding the imaging assessments required to demonstrate stable brain metastases 
•  Clarification for requirements of non-emergent unblindings, imaging assessments and survival FU 
Amendment 3 (31-Aug-2018) 
• 
• 
To allow testing of the hypotheses for ORR at IA1 independent of the outcome of the other hypotheses, 
the allocation of alpha was adjusted over the dual primary and key secondary endpoints. 
The timing of Interim analysis 1 (IA1) was changed from being driven by PFS events to occur ~9 months 
after 640 subjects were randomly assigned in Part 2 to ensure adequate follow-up time for the ORR 
analysis. 
•  Updated the censoring rules for PFS and DOR, to closely follows recent regulatory guidance (primary 
PFS analysis), and the “intent-to-treat complete follow-up principle” (first PFS sensitivity analysis). 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Interim  analysis  2  (IA2)  was  changed  from  OS  event  driven  (estimated  ~28  months  after  the  first 
subject randomized) to calendar time driven (~12 months after the last subject randomized) to allow 
IA2 be conducted at a pre-specified time point so that subjects will have sufficient follow-up time for 
analysis. 
The final analysis timing was changed from “~39.5 months after the first subject randomized” to “~23 
months after the last subject randomized” to accommodate the new assumptions for the enrollment 
period. 
To  prevent  alpha  over-spending  at  interim,  alpha  and  beta-spending  were  updated  to  use  the  time 
spending approach. 
Power for ORR, PFS and OS have been updated to be in alignment with the updated multiplicity strategy, 
and to accommodate the new assumptions for the enrollment duration and the prevalence of PD-L1 
positivity (from 60% to 75%) in mTNBC subjects updated based on recent available data. 
•  QoL evaluation has been promoted from an exploratory to a secondary objective. 
•  Removal of exploratory evaluation of efficacy endpoints based on irRECIST. 
Amendment 4 (20-Mar-2019) 
• 
The timing of the final analysis was changed from OS event driven to both OS event and follow-up time 
driven to ensure adequate follow-up duration at time of the final analysis.

•  Addition of a third efficacy interim analysis (IA3) between IA2 and FA. The added IA3 also matched the 
timing of a periodical safety interim analysis.  
Amendment 5 (04-Oct-2019) 
•  Data from external studies, including other indications of pembrolizumab monotherapy, demonstrated 
an enriched treatment effect with increasing PD-L1 expression. To identify an enriched population of 
subjects  that  could  potentially  benefit  more  from  pembrolizumab  plus  chemotherapy  in  metastatic 
TNBC,  the  objectives,  hypotheses,  and  statistical  analysis  plan  was  revised  to  include  primary  and 
secondary endpoints in participants with PD-L1 positive tumors with CPS≥10. 
•  Revised efficacy interim analyses plan, and updated multiplicity strategy to allocate initial alpha to PFS 
and OS in subjects with CPS≥10 to allow testing of added primary endpoints. 
• 
Extended trial follow-up time, to ensure adequate power for the testing of OS and PFS endpoints in the 
smaller CPS≥10 population. 
•  Revised multiplicity strategy to allocate initial alpha to PFS and OS in subjects with CPS ≥10, to allow 
testing of added primary endpoints. 
•  Revised hazard ratio, trial follow-up duration, and PFS dropout rate assumptions for power calculations 
to  reflect  information  from  latest  external  data  and  updated  statistical  analysis  plan  and  strategy. 
Revised power calculation based on the revised statistical analysis plan. 
•  Added  subgroup  analysis  to  examine  different  CPS  cutoffs,  and  to  align  with  the  updated  analysis 
strategy. 
Additional information regarding protocol amendment 5 and the choice of the PD-L1 CPS≥10 cut-off:  
Amendment 05 (4-Oct-2019) was initiated and finalized after efficacy IA1 had occurred (actual LPLV: 18 
Oct 2018). Following review and recommendation by an independent, external DMC at IA1, the study 
continued to IA2. Per protocol, the Sponsor remained blinded to IA1 efficacy and safety study results, 
including individual treatment assignment and CPS scores. A conservative Bonferroni approach was 
implemented for Type-I error control in amendment 05 by eliminating alpha spent at IA1. The MAH stated 
that the timing of amendment 05 had no impact on the results or integrity of the study.  
To minimize bias, all images for PFS (primary endpoint) evaluation were assessed by independent central 
reviewer who was blinded to both treatment assignment and PD-L1 status. Therefore, the MAH stated 
that the integrity of the study was preserved. 
The MAH stated that the DMC decision, based on IA1, did not drive the decision to proceed with 
amendment 05. Amendment 05 was based on the totality of scientific evidence from emerging clinical 
data from studies in metastatic TNBC external to KEYNOTE-355, namely KEYNOTE-119 and 
IMpassion130, which were not fully available to the Sponsor until June 2019. Both studies demonstrated 
an enriched treatment effect of PD-1/L1 inhibition in a PD-L1-enriched patient population.  
An enriched treatment effect in OS with increasing PD-L1 level was seen in other indications (HNSCC, 
urothelial carcinoma, gastric cancer). KEYNOTE-355 prospectively included the CPS cut-off ≥1 based on 
preliminary evidence from KEYNOTE-086 (Cohort B, 1L mTNBC CPS≥1). The addition of the additional 
cut-off CPS≥10 was related to data from 2 studies in the metastatic setting becoming available while 
KEYNOTE-355 was being conducted. KEYNOTE-119 demonstrated that pembrolizumab monotherapy 
provided a trend for improved OS with enrichment of tumor PD-L1 expression levels (CPS≥1 to CPS≥10) 
in recurrent locally advanced or metastatic TNBC tumors. In addition, as noted above, IMpassion130 
demonstrated that atezolizumab + nab-paclitaxel significantly prolonged PFS in PD-L1 positive tumors,

defined as PD-L1 stained tumor-infiltrating immune cells of any intensity covering ≥1% of the tumor area 
by the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP142) assay. The PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx assay used in KEYNOTE-355 uses 
the combined score of tumor and immune cells that stain positive for PD-L1 expression. Previous studies 
have shown that the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP142) assay produces lower PD-L1 numerical scores compared 
with the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx assay20 21 22, expected based on differences in the antibodies and IHC 
platforms as well as intrinsic differences in the definitions of the scores (IC vs CPS) themselves; 
therefore, it is not possible to substitute cut-offs across assays. The prevalence of participants identified 
as PD-L1 positive (IC≥1%) in IMpassion130 by the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP142) assay and the prevalence of 
participants with tumors that express PD-L1 with CPS≥10 by the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx assay in 
KEYNOTE-355 was similar between the 2 studies. 
Protocol deviations: 
Important protocol deviations (i.e. “those that may significantly impact the quality or integrity of key 
study data or that may significantly affect a participant’s rights, safety, or well-being”) were reported for 
83 (9.8%) participants in Part 2 of the study (10.6% vs 8.2% in the pembrolizumab + chemo vs chemo 
arm). Seven participants received incorrect study intervention (pembrolizumab or placebo); 6 participants 
received the incorrect study invention for 1 cycle and 1 participant for 6 cycles. 
Of the important protocol deviations, 27 (3.2%) participants had deviations that were considered to be 
clinically important (i.e. “deviations that may compromise critical data analyses pertaining to primary 
efficacy and/or safety endpoints or the participant’s safety”) (see table below).

No participant’s data were excluded from the Part 2 analyses due to an important protocol deviation.  
Overall, in the PD-L1 CPS ≥10 subgroup 9.6% of patients had an important protocol deviation, and 3.6% 
had a clinically important protocol deviation, which were similarly distributed in both treatment arms and 
were similar to the ITT population, 
No important protocol deviations that occurred during Part 2 of the study were classified as a serious GCP 
compliance issue. 
Premature unblinding  
A total of 125 participants were prematurely unblinded during Part 2, as follows: 
•  Sponsor-approved  non-emergency  unblinding  requests  for  discontinued  participants  to  determine 
subsequent therapy in participants failing study intervention; N = 102 
• 
• 
Inadvertent unblinding; N = 11 
Emergency unblinding through the call centre; N = 12.

BRCA mutations: Of the 847 enrolled subjects, 100 have known BRCA mutational status assessed locally 
(12%), of whom 17 were BRCA positive. Most of the BRCA mutant patients have PD-L1 positive tumors. 
BRCA mutational status is under investigation as part of the planned exploratory biomarker research, 
which is due to be completed and provided in 2023. 
Concomitant treatments:  
The reported concomitant interventions were generally balanced between the 2 treatment groups, except 
for the following that were higher (≥5% point difference) in the pembrolizumab + chemotherapy group: 
• Antidiarrheals, intestinal anti-inflammatory/anti-infective medications (16.9% vs 9.3%) 
• Medications for constipation (30.4% vs 24.6%)

• Systemic antibacterial medications (55.2% vs 47.3%) 
• Topical corticosteroids (18.1% vs 12.5%) 
Subsequent anticancer treatments:  
Subsequent anticancer treatments were received by 57.5% vs 66.2% of participants in the 
pembrolizumab + chemotherapy group vs placebo + chemotherapy group, respectively. The most 
common type of therapy administered in both treatment groups were antineoplastic agents, including 
capecitabine (29.4% vs 33.8%), carboplatin (10.7% vs 13.2%), cyclophosphamide (13.0% vs 15.3%), 
eribulin mesylate (13.7% vs 16%), gemcitabine (8.9% vs 12.1%), and paclitaxel (13.3% vs 12.8%). 
More participants in the placebo + chemotherapy group received subsequent immunotherapy, including 
atezolizumab (0.4% vs 2.1%), pembrolizumab (1.1% vs 4.3%) and nivolumab (0% vs 1.1%). 
Numbers analysed 
Efficacy analyses were based on the Part 2 ITT population (n=847), which included participants in the 
treatment arm to which they were randomly assigned, regardless of whether they received treatment. 
Participants enrolled in Part 1 were excluded from the efficacy analyses. According to PD-L1 expression, 
CPS≥1 patients were n=636, and CPS≥10 patients were n=323. 
PRO analyses were based on the PRO FAS population, defined as all randomized participants who received 
at least 1 dose of study intervention and had completed at least 1 PRO assessment. 
Outcomes and estimation 
The efficacy analyses were based on IA2, which was the final analysis of PFS and the second interim 
analysis of OS. Data cut-off date was 11-Dec-2019, approximately 18 months after the last participant 
was randomized. Median follow-up duration was 16.8 months (range 0.2, 35) in the ITT population 
(n=847) and 19.2 months (range 0.3, 35) in the CPS≥10 population (n=323). 
For the dual primary endpoints PFS and OS, PFS in the CPS≥10 population was statistically significant. OS 
in CPS≥10, as well as PFS and OS in CPS≥1 did not cross the prespecified efficacy boundary at IA2. PFS 
and OS in the ITT population were not statistically tested at the IA2 per the prespecified multiplicity 
strategy.  
For the secondary endpoint ORR, ORR in all participants and in the CPS≥1 population were only tested at 
IA1 and the success criterion were not met. ORR in all the three populations was not formally tested at 
IA2 per the prespecified multiplicity strategy.  
During the procedure, the MAH submitted the results of the final analysis for Overall Survival with data 
cut-off date 15-JUN-2021 (summarised at the end of this section).

PFS - Dual primary endpoint 
Pembrolizumab + chemotherapy demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS compared 
with placebo + chemotherapy in participants with tumors that express PD-L1 with CPS ≥10. With about 
67% of events/patients, the PFS HR was 0.65 (95%CI 0.49, 0.86), p=0.0012 [pre-specified boundary 
0.00411]; median PFS was 9.7 (95%CI 7.6, 11.3) vs 5.6 (95%CI 5.3, 7.5) months in the pembrolizumab 
+ chemotherapy vs placebo + chemotherapy, respectively.

OS 23 months (95%CI 18.8, 27.5) vs 16.1 (95%CI 12.6, 18.8), number of events 55% vs 68.9% in the 
pembrolizumab + chemotherapy vs placebo + chemotherapy arm. However, the observed p-value of 
p=0.0066 did not cross the prespecified efficacy boundary at IA2 (the multiplicity adjusted, one-sided 
nominal alpha level was 0.00472).

Secondary endpoints 
•  ORR 
Pembrolizumab + chemotherapy provides an improvement in ORR (per RECIST 1.1 by BICR) compared 
with placebo + chemotherapy (53.2% vs 39.8%) in participants with tumors that express PD-L1 with CPS 
≥10 (difference 13.6% [1.9, 24.8]; p=0.0115). ORR was only tested at IA1 and not formally tested at IA2 
per the prespecified multiplicity strategy, therefore the results of IA2 data may only be interpreted in 
exploratory manner.

10)

The results by Investigator assessment per RECIST 1.1 for confirmed responses were similar (ORR 53.2% 
vs. 34.0% in the pembrolizumab + chemotherapy group vs. the placebo + chemotherapy group; 
difference 19.1%); however reported ORR rates in the placebo + chemotherapy arm were numerically 
lower compared to the independent assessment. 
•  DOR 
In responders with tumors that express PD-L1 with CPS ≥10, the responses in the pembrolizumab + 
chemotherapy group were durable relative to those observed in the placebo + chemotherapy group 
(median DOR, 19.3 months vs 7.3 months). 
The results for DOR based on investigator assessment per RECIST 1.1 for confirmed responses in 
participants with PD-L1 positive tumors (CPS ≥10) showed the same trend as the primary results for DOR 
by BICR (median response duration 11.3 months vs. 8.0 months in the pembrolizumab + chemotherapy 
group vs. the placebo + chemotherapy group), but the difference between the treatment arms were 
smaller.

Analysis (HR and 95% CI) in the overall population is based on the stratified Cox regression model with Efron’s method of tie handling 
stratified by chemotherapy on study (taxane vs gemcitabine/carboplatin) and prior treatment with same class of chemotherapy in the 
(neo)adjuvant setting (yes vs no); analysis in the subgroups is based on the unstratified Cox model. If any level of a subgroup variable

The analyses of PFS and OS with CPS as a continuous score (after square root transformation) in a Cox 
regression model using IA1 data suggest that CPS score is a strong predictive factor in the 
pembrolizumab + chemotherapy group, while there is no evidence suggesting CPS affects the efficacy in 
the placebo + chemotherapy group (tables not shown). 
Ancillary analyses 
Patients reported outcomes 
Completion rates of the EORTC QLQ-C30 were above 93% in both the pembrolizumab + chemotherapy 
and placebo + chemotherapy groups at baseline among participants with PD-L1 positive tumors (CPS≥10 
and CPS≥1) and in All Participants, and remained high at Week 15 (between 70 and 77%).  
Compliance rates of the EORTC QLQ-C30, defined as the percentage of participants completing the 
measure among those expected to complete the measure (i.e. not missing by design) were similar at 
baseline in both arms among participants with CPS≥10 and CPS≥1 and in All Participants (above 93%) 
and remained high at Week 15 (between 81% and 88%). In the PD-L1 CPS≥10 population, at week 51 
compliance rate was approximately 90% in both arms.    
Similar rates of completion and compliance were observed for the EORTC QLQ-BR23 and EQ-5D. 
The time frame of 15 weeks for the change from baseline analysis was selected based on a prespecified 
required minimum completion rate of 60% and compliance rate of 80% to minimize the impact of missing 
data. 
EORTC QLQ-C30 Analysis 
•  Change from Baseline 
Baseline EORTC QLQ-C30 global health status/QoL scores were similar between the 2 treatment groups 
among participants with PD-L1 positive tumors (CPS ≥10 and CPS ≥1) and in All Participants. Over 15 
weeks of follow-up, there was either no decrease or a similar decrease in the pre-specified global health 
status/QoL, Physical Functioning and Emotional Functioning scores observed for both treatment groups.

• 
Time to Deterioration (TTD) 
In participants with PD-L1 positive tumors (CPS ≥10), there were no differences in TTD in the EORTC 
QLQ-C30 global health status/QoL [median TTD 6.4 vs. 5.6 months, HR 0.99] and Physical Functioning 
scores [median TTD 5.6 vs. 6.2 months, HR 1.27] between the pembrolizumab + chemotherapy and 
placebo + chemotherapy groups. A directional difference in favor of the placebo + chemotherapy group 
was observed for the TTD in the Emotional Functioning score [median TTD 9.6 vs. 15.3 months, HR 1.26 
[0.86, 1.84]; however, the 95% CI for the HR includes 1. 
TTD analyses in participants with PD-L1 positive tumors using the cutoff of CPS ≥1 and in All Participants 
showed similar trends for global health status/QoL, Physical Functioning, and Emotional Functioning 
scores.

EORTC QLQ-BR23 
In participants with PD-L1 positive tumors (CPS ≥10 and CPS ≥1) and in All Participants, the LS mean change 
from  baseline  to  Week  15  in  scores  for  EORTC  QLQBR23  functional  scales/items  (Body  Image,  Sexual 
Functioning,  Sexual  Enjoyment  and  Future  Perspective)  and  in  symptom  scales  (Systemic  Therapy  Side 
Effects, Breast Symptoms, Arm Symptoms and Upset by Loss of Hair) were similar between the 2 treatment 
groups. 
Exploratory Subgroup Analyses– EU Region 
The prespecified subgroups for geographic region was North America/Europe/New Zealand + Australia vs 
Asia  vs  Rest  of  World.  Post-hoc  analyses  of  the  EU  subpopulation  are  presented  to  further  examine  the 
treatment effect in this group. EU participants in the CPS≥10 population were n=64 in the pembrolizumab

+ chemotherapy group vs n=28 in the placebo + chemotherapy group; the results of these exploratory 
analyses should be interpreted with caution. 
Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics 
For participants with tumors that express PD-L1 with CPS ≥10 enrolled in the EU, intervention groups were 
generally balanced for most baseline characteristics and prognostic factors and were generally similar to 
the overall population of participants with tumors that express PD-L1 with CPS ≥10. Some differences are 
noted for participants enrolled in the EU: 
•  More participants in the pembrolizumab + chemotherapy group received paclitaxel (14.1%) compared 
with the placebo + chemotherapy group (7.1%) 
• 
Fewer  participants  in  the  pembrolizumab  +  chemotherapy  group  received  gemcitabine/carboplatin 
(43.8%) compared with the placebo + chemotherapy group (57.1%)  
•  More participants in the pembrolizumab + chemotherapy group had de novo metastatic disease (25.0% 
vs 17.9%) whereas more participants in the placebo + chemotherapy group had recurrent metastatic 
disease (68.8% vs 75.0%)  
•  More participants in the pembrolizumab + chemotherapy group had an ECOG of 1 (37.5%) compared 
with the placebo + chemotherapy group (28.6%)  
• 
• 
Fewer  participants  in  the  pembrolizumab  +  chemotherapy  had  an  LDH  level  within  normal  limits  at 
baseline (45.3%) compared with the placebo + chemotherapy group (60.7%)  
Fewer participants in the pembrolizumab + chemotherapy group received prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant 
chemotherapy (60.9%) compared with the placebo + chemotherapy group (75%).

The MAH presented during the procedure the Final Analysis (FA) for overall survival with a data cutoff 
date of 15-JUN-2021, with a median follow-up of 16.7 months (range 0.2, 53.1) in the ITT population 
(n=847) and 20.2 months (range 0.3, 53.1) in the CPS≥10 population (n=323). 
The testing of the primary hypotheses of PFS was completed at interim analysis 2 (FA of PFS) and was 
met at the IA2; PFS was not tested at the FA, although updated descriptive PFS analyses have been also 
provided. The key secondary hypotheses of ORR were only tested at IA1. 
Per protocol, this event-driven FA was triggered by ~240 OS events in participants with CPS≥10, ~482 
OS events in participants with CPS≥1, and ~664 OS events in All Participants. 
The overall type I error over the primary endpoints PFS and OS and the secondary endpoint ORR was 
strongly controlled at 2.5% (one-sided), with initially 0.5% allocated to the PFS hypothesis, 1.8% to the 
OS hypothesis, and 0.2% to the ORR hypothesis. 
At the FA, the primary endpoint of OS in participants with CPS≥10 was met. OS in the CPS≥1 population 
was not met at the FA, while OS in the ITT population was not statistically tested per multiplicity strategy.

Overall survival (final analysis) 
Pembrolizumab + chemotherapy was statistically superior to chemotherapy alone with respect to OS in 
participants with PD-L1 positive tumors (CPS ≥10). The observed p-value of p=0.0093 successfully 
crossed the prespecified efficacy boundary at the FA (the multiplicity adjusted, one-sided nominal alpha 
level was 0.0113); the OS HR was 0.73 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.95), with longer median OS in the 
pembrolizumab + chemotherapy group compared with the placebo + chemotherapy group (23.0 vs 16.1 
months), and OS rates by KM estimation at month 18 and 24 favouring the experimental arm.

Analysis (HR and 95% CI) in the overall population is based on the stratified Cox regression model with Efron’s method of tie handling stratified by 
chemotherapy on study (taxane vs gemcitabine/carboplatin) and prior treatment with same class of chemotherapy in the (neo)adjuvant setting (yes vs 
no); analysis in the subgroups is based on the unstratified Cox model. If any level of a subgroup variable has fewer than 30 subjects, subgroup analysis 
is not performed in that level of the subgroup variable. Database Cutoff Date: 15JUN2021.

There was a directional improvement in the OS HR that favored the pembrolizumab + chemotherapy 
group in participants with PD-L1 CPS≥1; however, the observed p-value of p=0.0563 did not cross the 
prespecified efficacy boundary at FA (the multiplicity adjusted, one-sided nominal alpha level was 
0.0172). OS HR was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.72, 1.04) in CPS≥1. 
Figure: Kaplan-Meier Estimates of Overall Survival (PD-L1 CPS ≥1) (data cut-off 15 Jun 2021)   
The primary hypothesis pertaining to OS in All Participants was not formally tested as per multiplicity 
strategy because the success criterion for the primary hypothesis of OS in participants CPS ≥1 was not 
met. The OS HR in all participants was 0.89 (95% CI: 0.76, 1.05).

The median DOR for responders with PD-L1 positive tumors (CPS ≥10) was 12.1 months (range: 1.6+ to 
45.9+ months) in the pembrolizumab + chemotherapy group and 7.3 months (range: 1.5 to 46.6+ 
months) in the placebo + chemotherapy group.

stratified by chemotherapy on study (taxane vs. gemcitabine/carboplatin), 
tumor PD-L1 status (CPS≥1 vs CPS <1 for ITT), and prior treatment with same 
class of chemotherapy in the (neo)adjuvant setting (yes vs no).

Clinical studies in special populations 
No data in special populations have been provided. Efficacy data of KN355 by age in the subgroup of 
patients with PD-L1 CPS ≥10 are summarized in the following table. 
Approximately 20% of patients in KEYNOTE-355 were aged ≥65 years, of those 16% were ≥65-<75 
years and about 5% were ≥75-<85 years. There was only one 85 years old patient in the pembrolizumab 
+ chemotherapy arm. No patients aged over 77 years of age was enrolled in the control arm. Efficacy 
results in patients <65 and ≥65 years were overall consistent.

Supportive studies 
Note: The MAH did not present any studies as supportive for the sought indication, although the clinical 
study reports of KEYNOTE-119, KEYNOTE-086 and KEYNOTE-012 in metastatic TNBC were included in the 
dossier. Brief summaries of these studies are presented below.  
KEYNOTE-119 
KEYNOTE-119 is a Phase 3 randomized, multicenter, open-label study of pembrolizumab versus single 
agent chemotherapy per physician’s choice [TPC] (capecitabine, eribulin, vinorelbin, gemcitabine) for 
participants receiving 2L or 3L treatment for mTNBC.

Primary objectives were OS in subjects with PD-L1 positive tumors CPS≥10, CPS≥1 and in all subjects. 
PFS, ORR and DOR were secondary endpoints. 622 participants were enrolled (312 in the pembrolizumab 
arm, 310 in the TPC arm). First participant first visit was on 27 Oct 2015; the CSR included results as of 
the 11-APR-2019 data cutoff. Approximately 65% of patients had CPS≥1 and 30% had CPS≥10 tumors. 
Pembrolizumab monotherapy as 2/3L treatment for metastatic TNBC did not demonstrate a statistically 
significant improvement in OS compared to TPC in all participants or in participants with PD-L1 positive 
tumors (CPS≥1 or CPS≥10). Main results are summarized below:  
OS HRs: ITT 0.97; CPS≥1 0.86; CPS≥10 0.78. 
PFS HRs: ITT 1.60; CPS≥1 1.35; CPS≥10 1.14. 
ORR: ITT 9.6% vs 10.6%; CPS≥1 12.3% vs 9.4%; CPS≥10 17.7% vs 9.2%. 
DOR: ITT 12.2 vs 8.3 months; CPS≥1 12.2 vs 6.5 months; CPS≥10 NR vs 7.1 months.

as 2L or 3L treatment of patients with mTNBC in its primary endpoint OS; a short overview is presented 
since KN119 results might support an association between PD-L1 expression status and efficacy outcomes 
(with the largest treatment effect in the not prespecified subgroup of patients whose tumors express PD-
L1 CPS ≥20). Data further provide indirect evidence that monotherapy with pembrolizumab in the 1L TNBC 
setting would not be considered appropriate.  
KEYNOTE-086 
KEYNOTE-086 was planned as an open-label, nonrandomized, single-arm, multicenter, multicohort, Phase 
2 study conducted in participants with centrally confirmed mTNBC, evaluating the efficacy and safety of 
pembrolizumab monotherapy as second line or above (2L+) in mTNBC with PD-L1 expression CPS≥1 and 
independent of PD-L1 expression (Cohort A), and as first line (1L) in mTNBC with PD-L1 expression CPS≥1 
(Cohort B). ORR was the primary endpoint. Overall, 170 participants and 84 participants were allocated to 
treatment in Cohort A and Cohort B, respectively. 
Cohort A (2L+): in the total population, ORR was 5.3% (95%CI 2.7%, 10%), Median DOR was not reached 
(range 1.2+ - 21.5+). Median PFS was 2.0 months, and median OS was 9.0 months. Results were similar 
regardless of PD-L1 status.   
Cohort B (1L): ORR of 21.4% (95%CI 13.9%, 31.4%). Median DOR was 10.4 months (range: 4.2 – 19.2+ 
months). Median PFS was 2.1 months and median OS was 18.0 months. 
KEYNOTE-012 
KEYNOTE-012  is  a  Phase  Ib  Multi-Cohort  Study  of  pembrolizumab  (10  mg/kg  Q2W)  in  subjects  with 
advanced solid tumors. The CSR presented the results of 32 subjetcs from Cohort A, where patients with 
TNBC were enrolled. Safety and tolerability was the primary objective of this study. Of the 32 TNBC Cohort 
subjects in the ASaT population, 15.6% (5/32) had either a CR or PR as measured by RECIST 1.1 by BICR. 
Of the 5 responders, 3 had 5 or more prior lines of therapy for metastatic breast cancer, 1 had 3 prior lines, 
and 1 had 1 prior line. Median DOR was not reached as of the data cutoff.  
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
This is an extension of indication for Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy for patients with locally 
recurrent unresectable or metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) with PD-L1 CPS≥10 and who 
have not received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease, based on the IA2 (final analysis for PFS and 
IA2 for OS) results of Part 2 of the pivotal study KEYNOTE-355, with data cut-off date 11-Dec-2019 
(approximately 18 months after the last participant was randomized). Median follow-up duration was 16.8 
months in the ITT population and 19.2 months in the CPS≥10 population. During the procedure, the MAH 
submitted also the final analysis for overall survival, with data cut-off date 15-Jun-2021 (3 years after 
last participant randomised), with median follow-up of 16.7 months. Part 1 of the study was an 
unblinded, open-label, safety run-in with 35 participants. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study KEYNOTE-355 is a randomized 2:1, double-blind, phase III study in previously untreated locally 
recurrent inoperable or metastatic TNBC comparing pembrolizumab (200 mg q3w) plus chemotherapy 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/563896/2021 
Page 85/163 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel or carboplatin/gemcitabine) vs placebo plus chemotherapy. The double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, add-on design of KEYNOTE-355 is endorsed. 
Adult patients with PS 0-1 and measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 were eligible. The diagnosis of TNBC 
was centrally confirmed in line with most recent ASCO/CAP guidelines. If previously treated with curative 
intent, such treatment should have been completed ≥6 months earlier (12 months if retreated with the 
same class of chemotherapy within the study), and if treated with (neo)adjuvant systemic treatment, 
anthracycline should have been given unless not indicated. The study allowed re-treatment with same 
class of chemotherapy (taxane or gemcitabine/carboplatin), if ≥12 months had elapsed between the 
completion of treatment with curative intent and first documented local or distant disease recurrence. If 
chemotherapy options included more than one regimen, choice of study chemotherapy was at physician’s 
discretion. Patients with early recurrences (i.e. between 6 and 12 months following completion of 
definitive treatment for early disease) were allowed. Other key eligibility criteria accounted for the known 
safety profile of pembrolizumab. Overall inclusion/exclusion criteria are considered acceptable and reflect 
the intended target population. The diagnosis of TNBC was centrally confirmed in line with most recent 
ASCO/CAP guidelines. 
The comparator, and backbone chemotherapy administered with pembrolizumab, was an investigator’s 
choice between 3 different chemotherapy options (paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel or carboplatin plus 
gemcitabine). The dosing regimens proposed of the chemotherapy drugs can be considered acceptable. 
Chemotherapy on study (taxane vs gemcitabine/carboplatin) was one of the stratification factors as was 
prior treatment with same class of chemotherapy in the (neo)adjuvant setting and PD-L1 status (CPS cut 
off 1). Overall, stratification factors are considered appropriate, however the randomization was not 
stratified according to PD-L1 positive tumors CPS≥10 (see below).  
Patients received treatment until confirmed disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of 
consent, or physician’s decision, with up to 35 cycles (2 years) for pembrolizumab/placebo.  
The MAH justified the inclusion of two different taxane options based on differential availability and 
clinical use worldwide and similar efficacies in terms of OS in mBC. Nab-paclitaxel is however not formally 
approved in EU as 1L treatment for metastatic breast cancer, although it was recently authorized in 
combination with atezolizumab in the same setting.  
Overall, 55% of KN355 study patients received gemcitabine/carboplatin and 45% received taxane as 
chemotherapy regimen. ESMO and NCCN guidelines recommend use of combination chemotherapy only 
for patients with “high tumor burden, rapidly progressing disease, and visceral crisis” and “taxane-based 
therapy would usually be considered as treatment of choice” for taxane-naïve and anthracycline non-
eligible patients according to ESMO guidance. Since nearly half of the study population were taxane-naïve 
(47%) and only 21% of patients had an early disease recurrence <12 months, the low proportion of 
patients treated with taxane (and the high proportion of patients treated with combination chemotherapy) 
does not appear in line with current guidelines. It was noted, however, that it was the sole responsibility 
of the physicians to choose between the different chemotherapy options.  
The choice of OS and PFS as primary objectives can be considered appropriate. Assessments of PFS, ORR 
and DOR were measured independently by BICR per RECIST 1.1 which is endorsed. 
The primary objectives/endpoints of KEYNOTE-355 were modified while the study was ongoing. Patients 
were enrolled regardless of PD-L1 biomarker status but were required to provide tumor tissue sample 
(unless contraindicated) for central testing and stratified according to PD-L1 tumor status (CPS ≥1 vs. 
CPS <1) in line with the biomarker plan of the original protocol that determined PD-L1 positive vs PD-L1 
negative subpopulation by a PD-L1 CPS cutoff of 1. The addition of a higher PD-L1 CPS cut-off of ≥10 
and the inclusion of subjects with PD-L1 CPS ≥10 in the primary analysis plan was introduced with 
amendment 5 (Oct 2019); it needs to be noted that Amendment No. 5 was finalised one year after the 
Assessment report

first interim analysis had occurred (18 Oct 2018). Although KEYNOTE-355 is a double-blind trial, the late 
changes in an ongoing study raise concern over the risk of a data driven approach, taking also into 
account that this study would have been negative based on the initial hypotheses. The MAH provided a 
justification that the selection of the CPS cut-off of 10 was not driven by any knowledge of IA1 results (IA 
conducted by independent DMC while the sponsor remained blinded to study results per protocol, 
including individual treatment assignment and CPS scores; the statistical criterion for success at IA1 was 
not met and the DMC recommended study continuation). The MAH documented that they did not have 
access to the IA1 DMC at the time point where the primary hypotheses testing was modified (Amendment 
5), and that the choice of the additional cut-off of CPS≥10 was based on external results from studies 
KEYNOTE-119 and IMpassion130, showing improved benefit with enrichment of tumor PD-L1 expression 
levels in TNBC. Meeting minutes of the eDMC from 3 Dec 2018 and the DMC recommendation form of IA1 
show that there was no content-related communication with the MAH. The DMC charter provides 
information about the DMC members and unblinded study statistician, and their confidential agreement 
about the obligation to keep all information related to the eDMC confidential and not to discuss 
information to anyone other than DMC members. The results of IA2 using the SAP specified in 
Amendment 4 versus that specified in Amendment 5 confirmed that without the inclusion of OS and PFS 
hypotheses for the PD-L1 positive CPS≥10 population with amendment 5 none of the primary endpoints 
would have been met under amendment 4. Regarding KEYNOTE-119, a trend toward numerically better 
results for pembrolizumab was seen in a PD-L1 enriched population of recurrent locally advanced or 
metastatic TNBC tumors in (2L+), not reaching statistical significance though. IMpassion130 study 
demonstrated that atezolizumab + nab-paclitaxel significantly prolonged PFS in participants with PD-L1 
positive tumors, defined as PD-L1 stained tumor-infiltrating immune cells of any intensity covering ≥1% of 
the tumor area by the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP142) assay. It is acknowledged that the timing the external 
results were publicly available is compatible with the date of Amendment 5 (IMpassion130 data were first 
publicly presented in Oct 201823, KEYNOTE-119 data cut-off was 11 Apr 2019). It is also acknowledged 
that published studies indicated that the VENTANA PD-L1 SP142 assay (used for atezolizumab) detects 
lower PD-L1 expression compared to the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx assay (used in pembrolizumab 
studies), although there is no exact correspondence between score and cut-offs. In particular, literature 
suggests that there is greater variability in immune-cell staining between the two assays. The prevalence 
of participants identified as PD-L1 positive (IC ≥1%) in IMpassion130 by the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP142) 
assay and the prevalence of participants with tumors that express PD-L1 with CPS ≥10 by the PD-L1 IHC 
22C3 pharmDx assay in KEYNOTE-355 was similar between the two studies (41% and 38%, 
respectively). In addition to the consideration regarding the choice of the PD-L1 cut-off, it is noted that 
the target magnitude of PFS and OS improvements was reduced in Amendment 5 compared to the 
original protocol success criteria (e.g. success criteria for PFS in the ITT population was 0.70 in the latest 
amendment, compared to 0.64 in prior protocol version). 
The explanation for adding the CPS≥10 population as a confirmatory hypothesis seems reasonably 
justified by external studies and biological rationale. The results of PFS and OS with CPS as a continuous 
score show that CPS is a strong predictive factor for the pembrolizumab + chemotherapy group, but not 
for the placebo + chemotherapy group. Therefore, the treatment effect increases with increasing CPS 
values. Beneficial treatment effect for subgroups with CPS values lower than 10 is currently not proven 
and the treatment effect does not improve meaningfully for patients with CPS values higher than 10. With 
the given results it is comprehensible to set the cutoff at CPS = 10.

The assumptions for median PFS of 5.5 months and OS of 17.5 months in the control arm were 
appropriately based on literature data available at the time of study initiation 24 25.   
The change in the multiplicity approach after interim analysis 1 was considered in the power calculation. 
For OS only the power calculation for the final analysis was described, not for the interim analyses. 
However, the provided power calculations are acceptable. Statistical methods were well reported in the 
protocol section and in the SAP, and considered appropriate. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Part 1 of KEYNOTE-355 was open-label safety run-in, where a total of 34 subjects received 
pembrolizumab + one of the three chemotherapy options (paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel, 
carboplatin/gemcitabine). Safety was the primary objective of this part: no new safety concerns were 
identified in part 1. Overall, the data can be considered in line with what observed in part 2, however 
efficacy results of part 1 are descriptive in nature and based on a limited number of subjects.   
Part 2 was the phase 3 study, on which efficacy data are based. At the data cut-off for IA2, more than 
90% of patients in both arms have discontinued treatment, mostly due to PD. In the ITT population, a 
higher number of patients discontinued pembrolizumab combination due to AE compared to 
chemotherapy alone, as well as due to patient or physician decision, while in the control arm more 
patients stopped study medication due to radiological and clinical progression. Similar trends are 
observed in the CPS≥10 population. 
Patients in the ITT population (566 vs 281 in the pembro+chemo vs placebo+chemo arm) were well 
balanced with regard to baseline characteristics in the two arms. All patients were female with median 
age of 53 (about 20% >65 years), approximately 70% were post-menopausal. About 60% had ECOG 0 
and 40% ECOG 1. Overall, 30% had de-novo metastatic disease. Of the remaining patients who received 
prior treatment for early disease, 20% had disease free interval between 6 and 12 months (i.e. early 
progressors), and about 20% received treatment with the same class chemotherapy used in the study in 
the (neo)adjuvant setting. Only few patients (3%) had history of brain metastases, therefore it is not 
possible to make any conclusion on efficacy/safety data in this subgroup. 
Study KEYNOTE-355 enrolled patients with previously untreated metastatic TNBC or locally recurrent 
inoperable breast cancer who could not be treated with curative intent. A low proportion of only 3% of 
study participants (n=25) were recruited with locally recurrent inoperable breast cancer. The MAH did not 
provide efficacy data for this subgroup of patients. Considering the limitations of the small patient 
numbers with locally recurrent disease it is acknowledged that no reliable conclusions could be drawn 
from these analyses. In view of the MoA and the disease characteristics of TNBC, extrapolation of efficacy 
data from metastatic to locally recurrent disease is considered possible. 
In the CPS≥10 subset, representing about 38% of the ITT population (220 vs 103 patients), baseline 
characteristics were overall similar to the ITT population. Although stratified by CPS with cut-off of 1 (and 
not 10), no pronounced unbalances in baseline characteristics are seen between the two arms clearly 
favouring the experimental arm. Few differences are however noted, such as age, number of patients 
receiving nab-paclitaxel or paclitaxel, patients with metastatic de novo/recurrence and DFI <12 months 
or history of brain metastases. Only 12% of enrolled subjects had mutational status assessed locally, of 
those 17% were positive, and most of the BRCA mutant patients have PD-L1 positive tumors. Due to the

limited data, no conclusion can be drawn at this stage, and the CHMP recommended that BRCA analyses 
could be provided as part of exploratory biomarker research in the future.  
Baseline characteristics were generally representative of a patient population with advanced TNBC, the 
majority of patients were <65 years of age, postmenopausal, had recurrent disease and visceral 
metastasis. However, only 3.4% of patients had a history of brain metastasis. Only 4% of patients were 
enrolled with locally recurrent inoperable disease.  
To summarize IA2 results (i.e. final analysis for PFS, interim for OS), PFS in the CPS≥10 population 
was the only endpoint reaching statistical significance. OS in CPS≥10, as well as PFS and OS in CPS≥1 
did not cross the prespecified efficacy boundary at IA2. PFS and OS in the ITT population were not 
statistically tested at the IA2 per the prespecified multiplicity strategy. For the secondary endpoint ORR, 
ORR in all participants and in the CPS≥1 population were only tested at IA1 and the success criterion 
were not met. ORR was not formally tested at IA2 per the prespecified multiplicity strategy in all the 
three populations.  
In the CPS≥10 population, with approximately 62% vs 77% of PFS events, a PFS advantage for 
pembrolizumab combo over chemotherapy was shown (HR=0.65, 95%CI 0.49, 0.86, p=0.0012), 
corresponding to gain in median PFS of about 4 months (9.7 vs 5.6 months). PFS curves were 
overlapping up to month 3, then diverged with a 15% improvement in PFS rate in favour of the 
pembrolizumab arm, which is maintained in the long term. A high number of censored events observed in 
the PFS curves in the two arms up to month 6 was similar in both arms and mainly due to subjects 
starting a new anticancer treatment before radiological disease progression. An updated PFS analysis 
performed at the time of the final analysis for OS, with nominal p-values only, was consistent with the 
primary PFS analysis.  
With more than half of the population experiencing an OS event, a numerical OS advantage was observed 
at IA2 in the PD-L1 CPS≥10 population, with a gain in median survival of about 7 months: HR 0.69 
(95%CI 0.51, 0.93), median OS 23 months (95%CI 18.8, 27.5) vs 16.1 (95%CI 12.6, 18.8). However, 
the observed p-value of p=0.0066 did not cross the prespecified efficacy boundary at IA2 (the multiplicity 
adjusted, one-sided nominal alpha level was 0.00472). The KM curves for OS separated since month 6 in 
favour of pembrolizumab + chemotherapy and remained separated over time; although curves tend to 
come closer toward the end, curves are no more interpretable after 18 months due to censoring. During 
the procedure, the MAH submitted the final analysis (FA) for OS. In the CPS≥10 population, OS result 
reached statistical significance. With 70.5% vs 81.6% of patients experiencing an OS event in the 
pembrolizumab + chemotherapy vs placebo + chemotherapy arm, the OS HR was 0.73 (95% CI: 0.55, 
0.95), with the observed p-value of p=0.0093 successfully crossing the prespecified efficacy boundary at 
the FA (the multiplicity adjusted, one-sided nominal alpha level was 0.0113). Longer median OS in the 
pembrolizumab + chemotherapy group compared with the placebo + chemotherapy group was seen 
(23.0 vs 16.1 months), and OS rates by KM estimation at month 18 and 24 favoured the experimental 
arm. The KM OS separate starting at approximately 6 months in favor of pembrolizumab + chemotherapy 
in participants with PD-L1 positive tumors (CPS ≥10) and remained clearly separated over time 
(censoring observed after month 36). At the final analysis, OS did not reach statistical significance in the 
CPS≥1 population, and was not formally tested in the overall population.  
In the CPS≥10 population, a numerical advantage in the secondary endpoint ORR was observed (53.2% 
vs 40%) for the experimental arm, including some more CRs (16.8% vs 12.6%). Durable (SD≥6 months) 
stable disease rate was similar in both arms, although more SD were recorded in the comparator arm 
(28% vs 44%).  
As expected, median DOR for responders was longer for the pembrolizumab containing arm compared to 
placebo+chemotherapy. In the pembrolizumab combination arm, median DOR was longer in the CPS≥10 
(19.3 months) than in the ITT population (10.1 months).

double-blind study was high and similar in both arms. Overall, in the CPS≥10, no relevant differences 
were observed between treatment arms in the various PRO scores and parameters examined. These 
results do not provide supportive evidence for the clinical relevance of the combination therapy in the 
claimed indication. However, they also do not raise concerns about intolerable toxicities that would 
interfere with patients’ quality of life. 
PFS2 analysis by investigator showed a numerical advantage for the experimental treatment over the 
control arm, which was more pronounced in the CPS≥10 population and can be considered supportive of 
the benefit of pembrolizumab + chemotherapy over placebo + chemotherapy in higher PD-L1 expressors: 
HR 0.69 (95%CI 0.49, 0.87), median PFS2 16.9 months (95%CI 13.8, 19.9) vs 10.9 (95%CI 9.1, 13.2).  
Various PFS sensitivity analyses were presented. Firstly, an analysis taking into account the few 
discrepancies between the stratification factors data entered in the IVRS and the actual data had almost 
the same results of the primary analyses, thus not raising concern. PFS assessed by investigator showed 
(unexpectedly) worse results compared to BICR assessment. Worse HR was noted in the most 
conservative sensitivity analysis 2 as a higher number of subjects in the experimental combination arm 
than in the chemotherapy arm started a new anticancer treatment before radiological progression 
(considered as events in this analysis). It is acknowledged that the PFS primary analysis censoring by 
BICR was prespecified in the protocol. The results of the provided sensitivity analyses overall, however, 
do not fully support the primary analysis, which is not very reassuring. 
The mostly used chemotherapy backbone was carboplatin/gemcitabine (about 55% of patients), 
followed by nab-paclitaxel (about 30%) and paclitaxel (15%). It is of concern that patients randomized to 
carboplatin/gemcitabine, representing more than half of the population, obtained limited or no benefit at 
all in all efficacy endpoints (PFS, OS and ORR) from the addition of pembrolizumab to backbone 
chemotherapy, differently from what observed in patients receiving taxanes. In particular, it seems that 
patients who received carboplatin/gemcitabine in the control arm performed better than patients treated 
with taxanes. Some differences in baseline characteristics between chemotherapy backbones were 
notable, as well as some differences between the pembrolizumab + chemotherapy arm and the placebo + 
chemotherapy as to be expected. Cox regressions showed however that the difference between treatment 
effects of patients treated with Gemcitabine/Carboplatin and Taxane cannot be explained by baseline 
characteristics, even by adjusting for disease free interval. Based on an inter-trial comparison, the 
outcome in the placebo + carboplatin/gemcitabine or pemetrexed arms in KEYNOTE-355 was not 
necessarily very consistent with external data. However, due to the small number of patients in the 
placebo + chemotherapy arms (especially paclitaxel, n=11) and the limitations of indirect study 
comparisons, conclusions are hampered, and results are prone to random variations. The question 
whether gemcitabine/carboplatin would be less effective than pembrolizumab + taxanes when 
administered to patients with tumors that express PD-L1 (CPS ≥10) is clinically relevant. However, it is 
acknowledged that there are many uncertainties around this question and maybe available data are not 
sufficient to draw reliable conclusions. In conclusion, the criteria used to choose one of the chemotherapy 
regimens remain not fully clear. Differences in baseline and prognostic criteria are notable, though 
measured characteristics do not seem to have an impact on the results. The performance of the different 
chemotherapy backbones in the control arm is variable. Numbers are small in subgroups and differences 
cannot be explained. Given the experience with pembrolizumab as add-on to platinum compounds in 
other disease settings, it would not be biologically plausible to assume a lack of treatment effect with 
carboplatin/gemcitabine as backbone. When considering the relevance to add information in the SmPC 
about the different treatment effects per chemotherapy regimen, it was agreed that, based on the 
available evidence, such information might not be appropriate.  
The benefit of the addition of pembrolizumab to paclitaxel vs paclitaxel alone seems more pronounced 
than for pembrolizumab + nab-paclitaxel vs nab-paclitaxel. This is in contrast with what observed in

studies IMpassion-13026 27and IMpassion-13128 29 (atezolizumab + nab-paclitaxel or paclitaxel, 
respectively). While no concern is raised by KEYNOTE-355 results over the use of pembrolizumab 
combined with paclitaxel in this setting, limitations of subgroup analyses are acknowledged, especially for 
the limited number of patients receiving paclitaxel (33 vs 11 in the experimental and control arm, 
respectively, of the CPS≥10 population).  
Patients with early recurrences (i.e. between 6 and 12 months following completion of definitive 
treatment for early disease) were enrolled in KEYNOTE-355 and represented about 20% of the total 
population, while not included instead in similar trials in the same setting (e.g. IMpassion-130 and -131). 
According to subgroup analyses, pembrolizumab on top of chemotherapy appears not to give survival or 
response advantage compared to chemotherapy alone in this subgroup. However, it is acknowledged the 
limited number of subjects who had early recurrence, especially in the CPS≥10 population and in the 
control arm (n=17), and the lack of support from other trials, limiting the possibility to draw conclusions 
in this population.  
Regarding age, efficacy results were overall consistent in patients <65 and ≥65 years. No conclusions 
can be drawn regarding efficacy in patients ≥75 years (n=10). 
Heterogeneous treatment effects were further observed taking prior (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy 
treatments into consideration. Patients with prior chemotherapy (n=193) had a smaller additional 
benefit by adding pembrolizumab compared with patients without prior (neo)adjuvant therapy (n=130): 
PFS HR 0.78 vs. 0.47, OS HR 0.90 vs. 0.46, and ORR difference 3.8% vs. 27.7% for patients with and 
without prior treatment, respectively. The same was observed in the analogous IMpower130 study. 
Assessment of baseline characteristics and prognostic factors for patients with and without prior 
(neo)adjuvant chemotherapy and sensitivity analyses to account for possible differences in baseline 
factors did not identify a single factor that could explain the observed differences in efficacy outcomes 
between both subgroups. Only “number of metastatic organ sites at baseline” changed the HR estimates 
in participants with prior (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy (PFS 0.78 to 0.66; OS 0.90 to 0.76), likely due to 
baseline imbalances, as a higher proportion of participants in the pembrolizumab arm had ≥3 metastatic 
organ sites as compared to the placebo arm in this subgroup.  
In addition, no clear benefit was observed for the European population based on a post-hoc analysis (PFS 
HR 1.02; OS HR 1.41; ORR difference – 5.8% for the comparison of pembrolizumab + chemotherapy arm 
compared to the placebo + chemotherapy arm in the CPS ≥10 subgroup), within the limit of small 
number of EU patients (64 vs 28 in the CPS≥10 population). Compared to the ITT population, an 
outperformance of the control arm and more modest results in the experimental group were noted. Such 
negative trend was however not observed in the pre-specified subgroup Europe + North America + 
Australia (which includes EU patients). Some differences were observed in baseline characteristics 
between the two arms for participants enrolled in EU, as expected due to small number, but no single 
baseline factor seems to explain the observed results in the EU subgroup. Overall, within each region, 
intervention groups were generally well-balanced for all baseline characteristics and prognostic factors. 
Considering that the larger subgroup “Europe/ North America / Australia” with CPS ≥10 (n=212) derived 
a benefit, and that there is no biological plausible rationale that the European TNBC patients would derive 
an inferior benefit, the results in the European CPS ≥10 population could theoretically be a chance finding 
due to random variation.

2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The pivotal double-blind KEYNOTE-355 study, at the IA2 (final analysis for PFS), showed a statistically 
significant improvement in PFS for pembrolizumab+chemotherapy compared to placebo+chemotherapy 
as 1L treatment of locally recurrent unresectable/metastatic TNBC patients only in the subset whose 
tumor has high PD-L1 expression (CPS≥10) (HR=0.65, gain in median PFS of 4 months). This result is 
supported by a statistically significant OS advantage at the final analysis for OS. ORR, DOR and PFS2 
were also in favour of the combination. The main concern derived from the late addition of the 
hypotheses in CPS≥10 population one year after conducting IA1, in an otherwise negative trial. The claim 
that the rational of the additional CPS≥10 cut off was based only on external results (KEYNOTE-119 and 
IMpassion-130) and no data from KEYNOTE-355 study itself was used is accepted. The biological rationale 
for an enriched pembrolizumab efficacy with higher PD-L1 expression is considered supported by the 
above external data, whose timing is also compatible with the amendment released, and by 
pembrolizumab data in various diseases. Additional data provided reassured that the MAH was blinded to 
data and that was comprehensible to set the cutoff at CPS 10. It is acknowledged that there are many 
uncertainties around the observed lower benefit of pembrolizumab in combination with 
carboplatin/gemcitabine and available data are not sufficient to draw reliable conclusions on this aspect. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety data of pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA, MK-3475) in combination with chemotherapy 
(nab-paclitaxel, paclitaxel, or gemcitabine/carboplatin) in the context of its intended use for the 
treatment of patients with locally recurrent inoperable or metastatic TNBC, derive from the pooled data 
from Part 1 and Part 2 of study KEYNOTE-355.  
Part 1 – safety run-in: unblinded, open-label, safety run-in that monitored participants (N=35) for 
unacceptable toxicities to study treatment (pembrolizumab + chemotherapy). Participants were assigned 
by forced randomization to ensure at least 10 participants were included in each treatment group 
(pembrolizumab + gemcitabine/carboplatin or pembrolizumab + taxane [paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel]). 
Part 2 – phase 3 study: double-blind, placebo-controlled study on a background of chemotherapy, with 
847 eligible participants randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive pembrolizumab + chemotherapy or 
placebo + chemotherapy, respectively.

Upon request, the MAH provided a pooled analysis of safety data by age categories (<75 years and ≥ 75 
years of age) comprising all pembrolizumab combination studies conducted across different indications. 
The sample size consisted of a total of 1871 patients aged <75 years and 162 patients aged ≥ 75 years 
who were exposed to the combination pembrolizumab+chemotherapy, compared to 1359 patients aged 
<75 years and 123 patients aged ≥ 75 years who were assigned to chemotherapy only. Data were pooled 
from individual studies conducted in lung, HNSCC, esophaegeal and TNBC tumours. The MAH also 
presented a pooled analysis related to pembrolizumab monotherapy across tumours.

Table 6 
Adverse Event Summary by Age  
(ASaT Population) 
Exposure in patients aged ≥ 75 years is generally lower than those with age <75 years, in both combination 
and monotherapy pooled datasets. This can be partly attributable to a higher rate of fatalities and drug 
discontinuation due to AEs, including SAEs, in older than younger participants. 
In looking at the combined therapeutic scheme, it should be recognised that within the comparator arm 
(chemotherapy  only)  these  events  were  generally  more  frequent  in  patients  older  than  75  years  with 
respect  to  their  younger  counterpart,  in  line  with  the  age-dependent  frailty  that  clearly  affects  drug 
tolerability. However, the rate of fatalities and drug discontinuation increases with the combined therapy 
vs chemotherapy in both age categories. When considering AEOSI only, ageing in itself seems to increase 
the rate of these events in the control group (chemotherapy only); however, pembrolizumab in addition to 
Assessment report

Page 126/163 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
chemotherapy further amplifies the occurrence of events in both age categories, particularly in the oldest 
group.    
The age-dependent increase in AEOSI that emerges in pembrolizumab+chemotherapy pooled dataset, is 
not  observable  in  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  since  an  equal  rate  of  events  was  reported  in  both  age 
categories.  
The analysis of specific AEs by age reveals that CNS, AE related to falling, CV and cerebrovascular events 
were  all  increased  by  pembrolizumab  when  added  to  chemotherapy  in  the  group  of  patients  ≥75  years, 
while  a  similar  frequency  of  these  events  is  recognisable  between  pembrolizymab+chemotherapy  and 
chemotherapy alone in patients <75 years. Of note, within the comparator arm (chemotherapy only) there 
is  no  difference  in  the  incidence  of  these  events  between  age  categories.  In  the  monotherapy  pooled 
dataset, patients ≥75 years experienced more numerous CNS, AE related to falling, CV and cerebrovascular 
events than their younger counterpart. However, as these are events commonly associated with ageing, 
disantangling  the  effect  of  age  from  drug  is  challenging.  Taken  together,  these  data  suggest  that 
pembrolizumab as add-on to chemotherapeutic agents is less tolerated in patients ≥75 years of age than 
their younger counterpart. This pooled analysis corroborates the consistent trend observed across individual 
studies showing increased toxicity of pembrolizumab as add-on to chemotherapy by age. Amendments to 
the SmPC to appropriately reflect these data has been requested (please refer to the PI)

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The overall incidence of drug-related AEs resulting in discontinuation of any study intervention was higher 
in the pembrolizumab + chemotherapy group (18.6%) compared with the placebo + chemotherapy group 
(11.0%). The higher incidence of drug-related AEs resulting in discontinuation of study intervention in the 
pembrolizumab + chemotherapy group were primarily driven by pneumonitis and events that occurred in 
<1%  of  participants.  Pneumonitis  is  a  known  AEOSI  for  pembrolizumab  and  the  observed  incidence  of 
pneumonitis  leading  to  discontinuation  of  any  study  intervention  was  similar  to  the  pembrolizumab 
monotherapy RSD (1.2% vs 1.5%, respectively). There were no trends observed suggesting a new safety 
concern for pembrolizumab + chemotherapy. 
The overall incidence of drug-related AEs leading to the discontinuation of any study treatment was higher 
in  the  pembrolizumab  +  chemotherapy  group  (18.6%)  compared  with  the  pembrolizumab  monotherapy 
RSD  (6.9%).  The  higher  incidence  was  primarily  driven  by  the  following:  neutropenia  (1.7%  vs  0%), 
increased ALT (2.0% vs 0.3%), increased AST (1.5% vs 0.3%), decreased neutrophil count (1.2% vs 0%), 
neuropathy peripheral (1.3% vs 0%), and peripheral sensory neuropathy (1.0% vs 0%). These differences 
were consistent with the established safety profiles of the chemotherapies administered.

UPDATED SAFETY RESULTS - FINAL ANALYSIS 
During the procedure, the MAH submitted the results of the final analysis (FA) for OS with data cut-off 
date 15 Jun 2021.  
The safety profile of pembrolizumab in combination chemotherapy observed at the FA is generally 
consistent with the known safety profiles of pembrolizumab monotherapy and the chemotherapies 
administered and is consistent with safety at IA2. No new safety concerns were identified at the FA for 
pembrolizumab. 
A summary of the updated safety data is presented in the tables below:

Post marketing experience 
The safety profile of pembrolizumab was summarized in the Periodic Safety Update Report covering the 
period 04-SEP-2019 through 03-SEP-2020. There are no records of any pembrolizumab registration being 
revoked or withdrawn for safety reasons in any country. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety data in support of the new indication of pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®, MK-3475) in 
combination with chemotherapy (nab-paclitaxel, paclitaxel, or gemcitabine/carboplatin) for the treatment 
of patients with locally recurrent inoperable or metastatic TNBC, derive from the pooled data from Part 1 
and Part 2 of study KEYNOTE-355. With a cutoff date of 11 DEC 2019, the safety database includes a 
total of 596 participants who were exposed to the drug combination for a median length of 6.2 months 
(50.7% had > 6-month exposure), compared to a total of 281 subjects recruited in the placebo arm for 
which exposure slightly shorter, i.e. 5.3 months in median (44.5% had >6-month exposure).  
As an indirect comparative analysis, the MAH also presented data on pembrolizumab monotherapy in 
participants with metastatic TNBC as derived from studies KEYNOTE-012, KEYNOTE-086, and KEYNOTE-
119, for a total of 595 subjects who, however, received treatment for a considerably short time course of 
only 2.1 months in median (only 17.6% of total subjects has exposure >6 months). Therefore, the 
information provided by this safety dataset is limited to a short-term estimation of the safety profile of 
pembrolizumab as add-on to chemotherapy vs pembrolizumab alone in the target population. More 
informative, for the long-term evaluation, is the reference safety dataset (RSD, N=5884) including all 
currently approved indications for pembrolizumab monotherapy, that provides data for an exposure 
median length of 4.9 months. However, given the underlying disease, study KEYNOTE-355 offers a safety 
analysis specifically restricted to female subjects who generally constituted a minority of previous safety 
database (33.9% of RSD), and younger patients than previously treated (median age of 54 and 53 years 
in the pembrolizumab and placebo arm, respectively, vs 62 years in RSD). 
In the pivotal trial, the main demographic characteristics appeared generally well-balanced between 
pembrolizumab+ chemotherapy and placebo+chemotherapy groups. Overall features were: 100% 
females, 78% <65 years, 68% White race, 60% ECOG PS 1. When compared to the pooled 
pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD, TNBC patients were younger. 
The majority of patients (55%) received pembrolizumab in combination with carboplatin/gemcitabine, 
32% of the patients were treated with the combination of pembrolizumab and nab-paclitaxel and only 
13% of the patients were treated with pembrolizumab and paclitaxel. 
The analysis of summary of adverse events revealed an unfavourable toxicity profile for the 
experimental therapy, based on significant between-treatment arm differences in terms of SAEs (30.4% 
vs 23.8%), drug-related SAEs (17.6% vs 12.1%), pembrolizumab/placebo dose modifications (52.7% vs 
47.7%) and paclitaxel dose modification (10.1% vs 7.5%), any drug discontinuation due to adverse 
events (21.5% vs 13.2%) with particular reference to pembrolizumab/placebo (10.1% vs 5.3%) and, to a 
less extent, nab-paclitaxel (4.4% vs 1.4%), paclitaxel (3.2% vs 2.1%), gemcitabine (6.5% vs 5.7%) and 
carboplatin (7.4% vs 6.0%) discontinuations; a similar trend was observable for drug discontinuations 
due to drug-related adverse events (18.6% vs 11%), including serious drug-related adverse events 
(8.6% vs 3.2%). Of note, fatalities (2.5% vs 1.8%) were also more frequent in the experimental vs 
control arm.  
In the comparison with pembrolizumab monotherapy as based on the RSD, all the above mentioned AE 
categories occurred at higher rate in the pembrolizumab+chemotherapy arm of KEYNOTE-355, with the 
exception of SAEs (38.3% in RSD) and deaths (5.3% in RSD), likely due to the older age of patients and

the different tumour-related symptoms and severity of disease of the RSD database. These finding were 
confirmed in the exposure-adjusted analysis.  
The most common AEs (incidence ≥40%) that occurred at a similar rate in both arms were anaemia, 
nausea and neutropenia, likely associated to chemotherapy side effects. Alopecia, fatigue, diarrhoea, 
constipation and vomiting were also very common (incidence ≥20%) and comparable between treatment 
groups. Significantly more frequent in the pembrolizumab+chemotherapy arm were alanine (24.5% vs 
19.6%) and aspartase (23% vs 16.7%) aminotransferase increase, decreased appetite (21.5% vs 
13.9%), cough (21.1% vs 17.4%), rash (19.6% vs 11.7%), pruritus (15.6% vs 11.4%), hypothyroidism 
(15.9% vs 3.2%) and upper respiratory tract infections (11.4% vs 8.9%). Data suggest a potentiating 
effect of pembrolizumab on chemotherapy-associated toxicities, as previously observed in other 
indications.  
The drug-related AEs observed for participants treated with pembrolizumab + chemotherapy (96.3% vs 
95%) were consistent with the known safety profiles of chemotherapy, being blood disorders (anemia, 
neutropenia, thrombocytopenia), nausea, alopecia and liver toxicity (ALT and AST increase) the prevailing 
reported events in both arms; rash (15.4% vs 9.3%) and hypothyroidism (13.4% vs 2.8%), that are 
known side effects of pembrolizumab, also presented with common frequency (>10% in rate) in the 
experimental but not the placebo arm; and with higher frequency than the RSD (11.4% and 9.5% for 
rash and hypothyroidism, respectively). 
In terms of severity, the majority of patients experienced Grade 3-5 AEs (78% vs 73.7% in 
pembrolizumab+chemotherapy and placebo+chemotherapy, respectively). Blood disorders and liver 
toxicity were the most frequently reported AEs with a comparable rate (>5% incidence rate) in both 
arms.  Most of these were drug-related Grade 3-5 AEs (68.3% vs 66.9%). Their incidence was 
substantially higher than what observed in the RSD (47.8% and 15.4% for grade 3-5 AEs and drug-
related grade 3-5 AEs, respectively). 
As regards SAEs (30.4% vs 23.8%), events demonstrated a pattern that is consistent with 
chemotherapy-associated toxicities (anaemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, sepsis, 
pneumonia were among the most prevalent cases); colitis, which is a known AEOSI for pembrolizumab, 
occurred with an incidence of 0.2%, below the previously reported rate of 1% in the RSD. Drug-related 
SAEs occurred more frequently in the pembrolizumab+chemotherapy arm than chemotherapy alone; 
they were mostly related to the blood disorder (5.7% vs 4.6%), gastrointestinal (2.9% vs 2.1%), 
laboratory investigation (2.5% vs 1.4%) and liver (1.3% vs 0.7%) categories; however, also, renal 
(0.8% vs 0.7%) and endocrine (0.5% vs 0%) toxicities were registered with higher rate in the 
experimental arm than either control of KN-355 or RSD, except for endocrine disorders that were more 
frequent in RSD (1%). 
The overall incidence of AEs resulting in death was worse in the combination pembrolizumab + 
chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone (15 vs 5 patients, 2.5% vs 1.8%). The majority of fatal 
AEs were related to cardiovascular events, but also septic shock and acute kidney injury occurred, both of 
them in the experimental arm and none in the placebo group. Two deaths in the pembrolizumab plus 
chemotherapy group were considered drug-related by the investigator. One event (pneumonia) was 
considered related to pembrolizumab and nab-paclitaxel and one event (acute kidney injury) was 
considered related to pembrolizumab.  
The incidence of AEOSI in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group was 28.2% (vs 10.7% in the 
control arm), which is similar to the previous experience with pembrolizumab monotherapy (24.9%). In 
study KEYNOTE-355, less SAEs (3.4% vs 6.4%) and drug-related SAEs (3% vs 5.7%) were reported in 
the experimental arm compared to the RSD. There were no deaths related to AEOSIs. The rate of any 
study drug dose modification (10.2% vs 8.9%) or discontinuation (4% vs 3.9%) was similar between 
pembrolizumab+chemotherapy and pembrolizumab monotherapy as reported in the RSD. The addition of 
Assessment report

chemotherapy apparently did not increase the risk and severity of AEOSI related to pembrolizumab 
compared to pembrolizumab monotherapy. The pattern of events is typical of pembrolizumab 
monotherapy; this consideration also applies to time of onset and event duration of events. There is, 
however, a higher incidence of hypothyroidism (15.9% vs 11%), with more events requiring 
corticosteroids (5.3% vs 1.5%) in KEYNOTE-355 relative to RSD. The exposure and sex-adjusted analysis 
confirmed no differences in the rate of AEOSI between KEYNOTE-355 and RSD. In terms of laboratory 
finding, blood cell count decrease and transaminase increase were the prevailing events, that were more 
marked in the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group than in control; the pattern is typical of 
chemotherapy-induced toxicities, so they occurred significantly more frequently than what observed in 
the RSD with pembrolizumab monotherapy.  
Discontinuation of any study intervention due to drug-related AEs was higher in the pembrolizumab 
+ chemotherapy group (18.6%) compared with the placebo + chemotherapy group (11.0%); the 
comparison with pembrolizumab monotherapy also demonstrated a worse profile in the experimental arm 
than previously reported in the RSD (6.9%). Neutropenia (1.7% vs 0%), increased ALT (2.0% vs 0.3%), 
increased AST (1.5% vs 0.3%), decreased neutrophil count (1.2% vs 0%), neuropathy peripheral (1.3% 
vs 0%), and peripheral sensory neuropathy (1.0% vs 0%) were the most common reasons for drug 
discontinuation, which is consistent with the safety profile of chemotherapeutics co-administrated. 
However, the tolerability of pembrolizumab +paclitaxel compared to pembrolizumab+ nab-paclitaxel and 
also to pembrolizumab +platinum-based chemotherapy is worrisome. 29.6% of the subjects discontinued 
any drug in the pembrolizumab + paclitaxel group (compared to 12.5% in the placebo + paclitaxel 
group). 16% discontinued pembrolizumab which is twice as high as the proportion of pembrolizumab 
discontinuations in the pembrolizumab + nab-paclitaxel group (7.6%) and the pembrolizumab + 
carboplatin/gemcitabine group (8.1%). The incidences of AEs and drug-related AEs leading to 
discontinuation of pembrolizumab were higher in the pembrolizumab + paclitaxel group compared to the 
pembrolizumab + nab-paclitaxel group. This was primarily driven by AEs of ALT increased (3.7% vs 
1.7%) and AST increased (6.2% vs 1.7%), which all occurred in ≤5 participants. Overall, the addition of 
pembrolizumab to paclitaxel is less tolerable than the addition of pembrolizumab to nab-paclitaxel. 
However, as the numbers are limited this should be interpreted with caution. 
Safety profile by subgroups 
Age: In study KN-355, a similar age-dependent increase in toxicity can be observed in both treatment 
arms when safety is analysed by using a cut-off of 65 years. The analysis by age groups <65, 65-74, 75-
84, 85+ revealed that pembrolizumab augmented the rate of CNS disorders, AEs related to falling and 
infections across all patient categories; particularly marked is the increase in CNS (24.1% vs 0%), AEs 
related falling (24.1% vs 0%) and infections (79.3% vs 44.4%) that is observable in the oldest patient 
group receiving the combined therapy compared to the corrispective in the chemotherapy arm. The 
comparison between pembrolizumab + chemotherapy and pembrolizumab monotherapy revealed an 
increase in events across all AEs categories, which is particularly evident marked for the group of >75-
year old. As previously observed in other indications for which combined regimens have been approved or 
are currently under review, the tolerability of pembrolizumab + chemotherapy is a concern for patients 
aged ≥75 years.  Given the limited number of subjects in this category within individual trials, a pooled 
analyses of pembrolizumab + chemotherapy across indications was requested. Data suggested that 
pembrolizumab as add-on to chemotherapeutic agents is less tolerated in patients ≥75 years of age than 
their younger counterpart. The pooled analysis corroborates the consistent trend observed across 
individual studies showing increased toxicity of pembrolizumab as add-on to chemotherapy by age. On 
this basis, a revision of section 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC was deemed necessary.   
Chemotherapy: Pembrolizumab generally increased the toxicity of all chemotherapeutic agents tested in 
the trial. The different drug combinations were overall comparable in terms of incidence of AEs. However, 
given the better tolerability of nab-paclitaxel compared to the other agents when used alone, the most

relevant impact of pembrolizumab on safety appears within the nab-paclitaxel groups, with a worsening 
in toxicity grade 3-5 events (62.8% vs 49.5%), drug-related grade 3-5 events (48.3% vs 36.8%), SAEs 
events (30.2% vs 17.9%) and drug-related SAEs (14.5% vs 7.4%), discontinuation due to adverse 
(16.3% vs 5.3%) or drug-related events (14% vs 4.2%) in patients treated with pembrolizumab+nab-
paclitaxel versus nab-paclitaxel alone. The frequency of these events, however, was similar compared to 
the other combinations.  
ECOG score: As expected, participants with a higher (1 vs 0) ECOG PS at baseline reported higher 
frequencies AEs across all categories and in both treatment arms; pembrolizumab slightly augmented the 
toxicity of therapy in both ECOG score categories.  
Race: Race does not seem to influence the toxicity profile of either regimens since similar rate of events 
is observable in white and non-white across all AEs categories; pembrolizumab worsened the toxicity of 
chemotherapy regardless of race.  
Region: the pattern of AEs as stratified by EU vs non-EU is similar. 
Updated safety data 
During the procedure, the MAH submitted the results of the final analysis for OS (data cut-off date 15 Jun 
2021). Overall, the updated safety results at the FA were generally consistent with those observed at IA2, 
with no new safety concerns identified.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Pembrolizumab as adds-on to chemotherapy presents an unfavourable profile compared to chemotherapy 
alone or pembrolizumab in monotherapy. The pattern of observed AEs is consistent with chemotherapy-
related toxicities; AEOSIs associated to the known safety profile of pembrolizumab were also observed 
and generally occurred at a similar rate than previously reported. The tolerability of the combined 
regimen appears worse in the oldest group of patients.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The sought indication is for Keytruda, in combination with chemotherapy, for the treatment of locally 
recurrent unresectable or metastatic triple negative breast cancer in adults whose tumours express PD-L1 
with a CPS ≥ 10 and who have not received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Due to the ER, PgR and HER-2 negativity, treatment of TNBC is challenging due to the lack of therapeutic 
target. In the sought locally advanced unresectable/metastatic first line setting, chemotherapy remains 
the only available non-investigational systemic treatment option for non-BRCA-mutated patients, with no 
specific recommendations regarding types of agents, with the possible exception of platinum compounds 
for BRCA-mutated patients. Anthracyclines and taxanes are preferred (depending on prior use), single 
agent capecitabine, vinorelbine or eribulin are also possible choices. In 2019, Tecentriq in combination 
with nab-paclitaxel was approved in the 1L TNBC setting for tumours having PD-L1 expression ≥1%, 
based on PFS advantage and positive OS trend shown in the pivotal IMpassion130 study30. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
KEYNOTE-355: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Phase III Study of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) plus 
Chemotherapy vs Placebo plus Chemotherapy for Previously Untreated Locally Recurrent Inoperable or 
Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer. Results of Interim Analysis 2 (IA2, i.e. final for PFS, interim for 
OS) with data cut-off date 11 Dec 2019, median follow up of 19.2 months (range 0.3, 35) in the CPS≥10 
population, have been submitted. During the procedure, the final analysis (FA) for OS was also submitted 
(data cut-off date 15 Jun 2021), with median follow up of 20.2 months (range 0.3, 53.1) in the CPS≥10 
population. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In participants whose tumors express PD-L1 CPS≥10, pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy provided: 
•  Statistically significant PFS by BICR per RECIST 1.1 benefit of pembrolizumab+chemotherapy vs 
placebo+chemotherapy: HR=0.65, 95%CI 0.49, 0.86, p=0.0012, corresponding to gain in median 
PFS of about 4 months (9.7 vs 5.6 months) at the IA2 (final for PFS), confirmed in an updated PFS 
analysis. 
•  Statistically significant OS results at the FA, with a gain in median survival of about 7 months: OS HR 
of 0.73 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.95), median OS 23 months (95%CI 19, 26.3) vs 16.1 (95%CI 12.6, 18.8). 
KM curves separate at month 6 and remain separated over time.  
•  Numerical advantage in ORR based on BICR assessment (52.7% vs 40.8%), including higher CRs 
(16.8% vs 12.6%).

•  Median DOR longer in the CPS≥10 (12.1 months) than in the ITT population (7.3 months).   
•  Supportive PFS2 trend: HR 0.69 (95%CI 0.49, 0.87), median PFS2 16.9 vs 10.9 months.  
•  No relevant differences were observed between treatment arms in the various PRO scores and 
parameters examined, neither supporting a benefit nor indicating a detrimental effect of additional 
toxicity by the addition of pembrolizumab 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
• 
There are many uncertainties around the observation in KEYNOTE-355 that gemcitabine/carboplatin 
would be less effective than pembrolizumab + taxanes and maybe available data are finally not 
sufficient to draw reliable conclusions.  
•  A post-hoc analysis on EU patients showed PFS and OS HR >1 and negative ORR difference. The 
small number of patients however (64 vs 28 in the CPS≥10 population) preclude further 
investigation, and it could be agreed that differences noted are likely due to random variation. 
• 
The treatment benefit is uncertain for patients with disease free interval <12 months [n=66]: PFS HR 
1.0, OS HR 1.19, ORR diff. minus 14.2%. Numbers are limited (especially in the control arm n=17), 
and there is no support from external studies, therefore no conclusions can be drawn in this 
population. 
•  A smaller treatment effect was also observed for patients with prior (neo)adjuvant treatment 
(n=193): PFS HR 0.78, OS HR 0.90, ORR difference 3.8%, similarly observed in the IMpower130 
study in the same setting. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
•  Overall AEs were more frequent with the addition of pembrolizumab to chemotherapy compared to 
chemotherapy alone, based on significant between-treatment arm differences in terms of SAEs 
(30.4% vs 23.8%), drug-related SAEs (17.6% vs 12.1%), pembrolizumab/placebo dose modifications 
(52.7% vs 47.7%) and paclitaxel dose modification (10.1% vs 7.5%), any drug discontinuation due 
to adverse events (21.5% vs 13.2%) with particular reference to pembrolizumab/placebo (10.1% vs 
5.3%) and, to a less extent, nab-paclitaxel (4.4% vs 1.4%), paclitaxel (3.2% vs 2.1%), gemcitabine 
(6.5% vs 5.7%) and carboplatin (7.4% vs 6.0%) discontinuations; a similar trend was observed for 
drug discontinuations due to drug-related adverse events (18.6% vs 11%), including serious drug-
related adverse events (8.6% vs 3.2%). Of note, fatalities (2.5% vs 1.8%) were also more frequent 
in the experimental vs control arm. 
•  The most common AEs (incidence ≥40%) that occurred at a similar rate in both arms were anaemia, 
nausea and neutropenia, likely associated to chemotherapy side effects. Alopecia, fatigue, diarreha, 
constipation and vomiting were also very common (incidence ≥20%) and comparable between 
treatment groups. 
•  Significantly more frequent in the pembrolizumab+chemotherapy arm were alanine (24.5% vs 
19.6%) and aspartase (23% vs 16.7%) aminotransferase increase, decreased appetite (21.5% vs 
13.9%), cough (21.1% vs 17.4%), rash (19.6% vs 11.7%), pruritus (15.6% vs 11.4%), 
hypothyroidism (15.9% vs 3.1%) and upper respiratory tract infections (11.4% vs 8.9%). 
•  The drug-related AEs observed for participants treated with pembrolizumab + chemotherapy (96.3% 
vs 95%) were consistent with the known safety profiles of chemotherapy, being blood disorders 
Assessment report

(anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia), nausea, alopecia and liver toxicity (ALT and AST increase) 
the prevailing reported events in both arms; rash (15.4% vs 9.3%) and hypothyroidism (13.4% vs 
2.8%), that are known side effects of pembrolizumab, also presented with common frequency (>10% 
in rate) in the experimental but not the placebo arm;  
•  Drug-related SAEs occurred more frequently in the pembrolizumab+chemotherapy arm than 
chemotherapy alone; they were mostly related to the blood disorder (5.7% vs 4.6%), gastrointestinal 
(2.9% vs 2.1%), laboratory investigation (2.5% vs 1.4%) and liver (1.3% vs 0.7%) categories. The 
overall incidence of AEs resulting in death was worse in the combination pembrolizumab + 
chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone (15 vs 5 patients, 2.5% vs 1.8%). The majority of 
fatal AEs were related to cardiovascular events, but also septic shock and acute kidney injury 
occurred, both of them in the experimental arm and none in the placebo group. 
•  The incidence of AEOSI in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group was 28.2% (vs 10.7% in the 
control arm), which is similar to the previous experience with pembrolizumab monotherapy (24.9%). 
In study KEYNOTE-355, less SAEs (3.4% vs 6.4%) and drug-related SAEs (3% vs 5.7%) were 
reported in the experimental arm compared to the RSD. There were no deaths related to AEOSIs. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
•  Data demonstrate a potentiating effect of pembrolizumab on chemotherapy-associated toxicities, as 
previously observed on other indications for which combined regimens have been approved. The 
tolerability of pembrolizumab + chemotherapy is a concern for patients aged ≥75 years. Relevant 
wording in the SmPC has been included on this aspect.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy showed PFS and OS advantage compared to 
chemotherapy in the subgroup with PD-L1 expression CPS≥10 as first line treatment of locally advanced 
unresectable/metastatic TNBC in the pivotal KEYNOTE-355 study. The statistically significant PFS benefit 
seen at the IA2 was later supported by a statistically significant OS at the FA, and supportive ORR, DOR 
and PFS2 results. The PFS and OS hypotheses in the CPS≥10 subgroup, defining about 38% of the ITT 
population, were however added with a protocol amendment one year after the IA1 conduction. The MAH 
claims that the choice of the additional CPS≥10 cut off was based only on external results (KEYNOTE-119 
and IMpassion130) and that no data from KEYNOTE-355 study itself was used. The biological rationale for 
an enriched pembrolizumab efficacy with higher PD-L1 expression is indeed considered supported by the 
above mentioned external data, whose timing is also compatible with Amendment 5 release, and by 
pembrolizumab study results in various diseases. At the same time, pembrolizumab monotherapy in 
pretreated TNBC in KEYNOTE-119 did not show outstanding results in this disease. 
As expected, pembrolizumab as add-on to chemotherapy presents an unfavourable profile compared to 
chemotherapy alone or pembrolizumab in monotherapy. The pattern of observed AEs is consistent with 
chemotherapy-related toxicities; AEOSIs associated to the known safety profile of pembrolizumab were 
also observed and generally occurred at a similar rate as previously reported. The tolerability of the 
combined regimen appears worse in the oldest group of patients. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy showed significant OS and PFS advantage compared to 
chemotherapy as 1L treatment in TNBC with PD-L1 CPS≥10 based on KEYNOTE-355 study. This 
outweighs the unfavourable profile compared to chemotherapy alone or pembrolizumab in monotherapy, 
and it can be concluded that the benefit/risk balance is positive. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The relevance of the generic wording “pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy” proposed 
in the indication was considered in view that the pivotal study KEYNOTE-355 was performed with 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/563896/2021 
Page 161/163 
 
 
 
 
pembrolizumab in combination with specific chemotherapy drugs. According to EMA guideline on the 
Wording of therapeutic indication (EMA/CHMP/483022/2019), “From a regulatory point of view, the 
therapeutic indication should be clearly stated in section 4.1 of the SmPC to reflect in which 
disease/condition and target population the benefit/risk balance is established to be positive.” 
Furthermore, “If there is a need to specify use in combination therapy in SmPC section 4.1: Is there a 
need to specify particular combinations (e.g. the studied combinations if it is expected that the 
benefit risk balance may differ with other combinations) or could a general statement ("in 
combination with other products") be used (with information on combinations studied reflected in other 
parts of the SmPC)? If so, since the description of performed studies in section 5.1 cannot be 
seen as restricting or broadening the indication, restriction or extrapolation in section 4.1 in 
terms of combination therapy should be justified in the assessment report.” The possibility to 
extrapolate the use of pembrolizumab in combination with any chemotherapy currently used in TNBC was 
supported by efficacy shown in available clinical trials in TNBC, although in different setting, such as 
KEYNOTE-522 (phase III, carboplatin-paclitaxel, doxorubicin or epirubicin-ciclophosphamide in the 
neoadjuvant setting) and ENHANCE-1 (phase Ib/II single arm, pembrolizumab+eribulin). It was agreed 
that there are no data to suggest that the benefit of adding pembrolizumab to any of recommended 
treatment regimens for patients with locally recurrent unresectable or metastatic TNBC would be altered 
depending on the chemotherapy backbone chosen. 
According to current guidelines (ESMO ABC 5th) for most patients, “chemotherapy remains the only 
available non-investigational systemic treatment option for non-BRCA-mutated triple-negative ABC, with 
no specific recommendations regarding types of agents, with the possible exception of platinum 
compounds for patients with BRCA-mutated triple-negative ABC.” Chemotherapy regimens that can be 
used include anthracyclines, taxanes, antimetabolite (capecitabine, gemcitabine), eribulin, platinum, and 
combination chemotherapies in patients with rapid clinical progression, life-threatening visceral 
metastases, or need for rapid symptom and/or disease control. 
On the one hand, there are previous experiences in other trials (atezolizumab + nab-paclitaxel and 
atezolizumab + paclitaxel in IMpassion130 and IMpassion 131 studies) showing a different outcome 
according to backbone chemotherapy in the same setting, that could suggest caution in extrapolation. On 
the other hand, the pembrolizumab study KEYNOTE-355 study showed no concern over the use of 
paclitaxel in combination with pembrolizumab (contrary to atezolizumab), though based on subgroup 
data.  
With regard to pembrolizumab in combination with carboplatin-gemcitabine, where a lower treatment 
effect was seen, it is considered that it is unlikely from a biological perspective to assume a lack of 
treatment effect with carboplatin/gemcitabine as backbone, given prior experience with this combination. 
The same reasoning could potentially apply to other chemotherapies. Although not all drugs have been 
combined with pembrolizumab, and there are not necessarily safety data available for each combination, 
it is not expected that the benefit/risk balance will differ with other combinations, therefore, in line with 
EMA guidelines, the use of “chemotherapy” in SmPC 4.1 can be considered acceptable. A reference to 
SmPC 5.1 was added at the end of the wording of the indication to raise awareness of the chemotherapy 
drugs used in the pivotal KEYNOTE-355 study (see SmPC section 4.1). It can be expected that physicians 
will use the combinations for whom there is clinical trial experience, although as noted in the EMA 
guidelines, 5.1 section does not restrict the indication. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy for the 1L treatment of locally recurrent 
unresectable or metastatic TNBC in subjects with PD-L1 positive tumours (CPS ≥10) is positive.

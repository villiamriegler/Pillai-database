Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for cabazitaxel, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
A cumulative query in Eudravigilance database had retrieved several serious cases of interstitial lung 
disease (16 cases) and pneumonitis (8 cases). A fatal outcome was reported in 6 cases out of the 16 
interstitial lung disease cases. In some patients who developed an interstitial lung disease 
/pneumonitis following a previous docetaxel treatment, an aggravation or a recurrence of the 
interstitial lung disease /pneumonitis was observed after cabazitaxel introduction (4 out of 16 
interstitial lung disease cases). Among these 4 cases, 3 had a fatal outcome. Therefore, the PRAC 
considered that the sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC should be updated to include interstitial 
pneumonia/pneumonitis and interstitial lung disease. The package leaflet should be updated 
accordingly.  
During the reporting period, a new signal “Pancytopenia/Bone marrow suppression” was detected 
following a request during the review of the additional precaution on anemia. According to cumulative 
tabulations, 7 serious bone marrow failure adverse drug reactions were reported during the reporting 
period, and 24 serious cases in total from post marketing sources. In addition, 3 cases of bone 
marrow failure or aplasia had a fatal outcome during the reporting period. All were unsolicited cases 
for which the marketing authorisation holder causality was “possible” for cabazitaxel. The PRAC 
therefore considered that the section 4.4 of the SmPC should be updated to add a warning on bone 
marrow suppression.  
Therefore, in view of the data presented in the reviewed PSUR(s), the PRAC considered that changes 
to the product information of medicinal products containing cabazitaxel were warranted. 
Based on the renewal procedure which was completed in November 2015 and after review of data on 
safety and efficacy, the PRAC considered that cabazitaxel should be removed from the list of products 
requiring additional monitoring.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for cabazitaxel the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing cabazitaxel is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) should be varied.

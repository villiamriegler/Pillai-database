CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Koselugo as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of symptomatic, inoperable plexiform 
neurofibromas (PN) in paediatric patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) aged 3 years and 
above.
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Treatment with Koselugo should be initiated by a physician experienced in the diagnosis and the 
treatment of patients with NF1 related tumours.
Posology
The recommended dose of Koselugo is 25 mg/m2 of body surface area (BSA), taken orally twice daily 
(approximately every 12 hours).
Dosing is individualised based on BSA (mg/m2) and rounded to the nearest achievable 5 mg or 10 mg 
dose (up to a maximum single dose of 50 mg). Different strengths of Koselugo capsules can be 
combined to attain the desired dose (Table 1).

a The recommended dose for patients with a BSA less than 0.55 m2 has not been established.
Treatment with Koselugo should continue as long as clinical benefit is observed, or until PN 
progression or the development of unacceptable toxicity. There is limited data in patients older 
than 18, therefore continued treatment into adulthood should be based on benefits and risks to the 
individual patient as assessed by the physician. However, start of treatment with Koselugo in adults is 
not appropriate. 
Missed dose
If a dose of Koselugo is missed, it should only be taken if it is more than 6 hours until the next 
scheduled dose. 
Vomiting
If vomiting occurs after Koselugo is administered, an additional dose is not to be taken. The patient 
should continue with the next scheduled dose.
Dose adjustments 
Interruption and/or dose reduction or permanent discontinuation of selumetinib may be required based 
on individual safety and tolerability (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Recommended dose reductions are 
given in Table 2 and may require the daily dose to be divided into two administrations of different 
strength or for treatment to be given as a once daily dose.

* Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)
Dose modification advice for left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) reduction
In cases of asymptomatic LVEF reduction of ≥ 10 percentage points from baseline and below the 
institutional lower level of normal (LLN), selumetinib treatment should be interrupted until resolution. 
Once resolved, selumetinib should be reduced by one dose level when resuming therapy (see Table 2).
In patients who develop symptomatic LVEF reduction or a grade 3 or 4 LVEF reduction, selumetinib 
should be discontinued and a prompt cardiology referral should be carried out (see section 4.4).
Dose modification advice for ocular toxicities
Selumetinib treatment should be interrupted in patients diagnosed with retinal pigment epithelial 
detachment (RPED) or central serous retinopathy (CSR) with reduced visual acuity until resolution; 
reduce selumetinib by one dose level when resuming therapy (see Table 2). In patients diagnosed with 
RPED or CSR without reduced visual acuity, ophthalmic assessment should be conducted every 
3 weeks until resolution. In patients who are diagnosed with retinal vein occlusion (RVO), treatment 
with selumetinib should be permanently discontinued (see section 4.4).
Dose adjustments for co-administration with CYP3A4 or CYP2C19 inhibitors 
Concomitant use of strong or moderate CYP3A4 or CYP2C19 inhibitors is not recommended and 
alternative agents should be considered. If a strong or moderate CYP3A4 or CYP2C19 inhibitor must 
be co-administered, the recommended Koselugo dose reduction is as follows:


If a patient is currently taking 25 mg/m2 twice daily, dose reduce to 20 mg/m2 twice daily.
If a patient is currently taking 20 mg/m2 twice daily, dose reduce to 15 mg/m2 twice daily (see 
Table 4 and section 4.5).

Special populations
Renal impairment
Based on clinical trials no dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild, moderate, severe 
renal impairment or those with end stage renal disease (ESRD) (see section 5.2).
Hepatic impairment
Based on clinical trials, no dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild hepatic impairment. 
The starting dose should be reduced in patients with moderate hepatic impairment to 20 mg/m2 BSA, 
twice daily (see Table 4). Koselugo is contraindicated for use in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment (see sections 4.3 and 5.2).
Ethnicity
Increased systemic exposure has been seen in adult Asian subjects, although there is considerable 
overlap with Western subjects when corrected for body weight. No specific adjustment to the starting 
dose is recommended for paediatric Asian patients, however these patients, should be closely 
monitored for adverse events (see section 5.2).
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of Koselugo in children less than 3 years of age has not been established. No 
data are available.
Method of administration
Koselugo is for oral use. It can be taken with or without food (see section 5.2).
The capsules should be swallowed whole with water. The capsules should not be chewed, dissolved, 
or opened, because this could impair drug release and affect the absorption of selumetinib. 
Koselugo should not be administered to patients who are unable or unwilling to swallow the capsule 
whole. Patients should be assessed for their ability to swallow a capsule before starting treatment. 
Standard medicine swallowing techniques are expected to be sufficient to swallow selumetinib 
capsules. For patients who have difficulties swallowing the capsule, referral to an appropriate health 
care professional such as a speech and language therapist could be considered to identify suitable 
methods that can be tailored to the particular patient.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
Severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).

4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) reduction
Asymptomatic decreases in ejection fraction have been reported in 26% of paediatric patients in the 
pivotal clinical trial. Median time to initial onset of these adverse reactions was 232 days. A small 
number of serious reports of LVEF reduction associated with selumetinib have been reported in 
paediatric patients who participated in an expanded access program (see section 4.8).
Paediatric patients with a history of impaired left ventricular function or a baseline LVEF below 
institutional LLN have not been studied. LVEF should be evaluated by echocardiogram before 
initiation of treatment to establish baseline values. Prior to starting selumetinib treatment, patients 
should have an ejection fraction above the institutional LLN.
LVEF should be evaluated at approximately 3-month intervals, or more frequently as clinically 
indicated, during treatment. Reduction in LVEF can be managed using treatment interruption, dose 
reduction or treatment discontinuation (see section 4.2).
Ocular toxicity
Patients should be advised to report any new visual disturbances. Adverse reactions of blurred vision 
have been reported in paediatric patients receiving selumetinib. Isolated cases of RPED, CSR and 
RVO in adult patients with multiple tumour types, receiving treatment with selumetinib monotherapy 
and in combination with other anti-cancer agents, and in a single paediatric patient with pilocytic 
astrocytoma on selumetinib monotherapy, have been observed (see section 4.8).
In line with clinical practice an ophthalmological evaluation prior to treatment initiation and at any 
time a patient reports new visual disturbances is recommended. In patients diagnosed with RPED or 
CSR without reduced visual acuity, ophthalmic assessment should be conducted every 3 weeks until 
resolution. If RPED or CSR is diagnosed and visual acuity is affected, selumetinib therapy should be 
interrupted and the dose reduced when treatment is resumed (see section 4.2). If RVO is diagnosed, 
treatment with selumetinib should be permanently discontinued (see section 4.2).
Liver laboratory abnormalities 
Liver laboratory abnormalities, specifically AST and ALT elevations, can occur with selumetinib (see 
section 4.8). Liver laboratory values should be monitored before initiation of selumetinib and at least 
monthly during the first 6 months of treatment, and thereafter as clinically indicated. Liver laboratory 
abnormalities should be managed with dose interruption, reduction or treatment discontinuation (see 
Table 2 in section 4.2).
Skin and subcutaneous disorders 
Skin rash (including maculopapular rash and acneiform rash), paronychia and hair changes have been 
reported very commonly in the pivotal clinical study (see section 4.8). Dry skin, hair colour changes, 
paronychia and rash maculo-papular were seen more frequently in younger children (age 3-11 years) 
and acneiform rash was seen more frequently in post-pubertal children (age 12-16 years).
Vitamin E supplementation
Patients should be advised not to take any supplemental vitamin E. Koselugo 10 mg capsules contain 
32 mg vitamin E as the excipient, D-alpha-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS). 
Koselugo 25 mg capsules contain 36 mg vitamin E as TPGS. High doses of vitamin E may increase 
the risk of bleeding in patients taking concomitant anticoagulant or antiplatelet medicinal products 
(e.g., warfarin or acetylsalicylic acid). Anticoagulant assessments, including international normalised 
ratio or prothrombin time, should be conducted more frequently to detect when dose adjustments of 
the anticoagulant or antiplatelet medicinal products are warranted (see section 4.5).
Risk of choking
Selumetinib is available as a capsule which must be swallowed whole. Some patients, in particular 
children < 6 years of age, may be at risk of choking on a capsule formulation due to developmental, 
6
anatomical or psychological reasons. Therefore, selumetinib should not be administered to patients 
who are unable or unwilling to swallow the capsule whole (see section 4.2).
Women of child bearing potential
Koselugo is not recommended in women of child bearing potential who are not using contraception 
(see section 4.6).
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Interaction studies have only been performed in healthy adults (aged ≥ 18 years).
Active substances that may increase selumetinib plasma concentrations
Co-administration with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (200 mg itraconazole twice daily for 4 days) 
increased selumetinib Cmax by 19% (90% CI 4, 35) and AUC by 49% (90% CI 40, 59) in healthy adult 
subjects.
Co-administration with a strong CYP2C19/moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (200 mg fluconazole once 
daily for 4 days) increased selumetinib Cmax by 26% (90% CI 10, 43) and AUC by 53% (90% CI 44, 
63) in healthy adult subjects, respectively.
Concomitant use of erythromycin (moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor) or fluoxetine (strong 
CYP2C19/CYP2D6 inhibitor) is predicted to increase selumetinib AUC by ~30-40% and Cmax by 
~20%.
Co-administration with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., clarithromycin, grapefruit juice, oral 
ketoconazole) or CYP2C19 (e.g., ticlopidine) should be avoided. Co-administration with moderate
inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin and fluconazole) and CYP2C19 (e.g., omeprazole) should 
be avoided. 
If co-administration is unavoidable, patients should be carefully monitored for adverse events and the 
selumetinib dose should be reduced (see section 4.2 and Table 4).
Active substances that may decrease selumetinib plasma concentrations
Co-administration with a strong CYP3A4 inducer (600 mg rifampicin daily for 8 days) decreased 
selumetinib Cmax by -26% (90% CI -17, -34) and AUC by -51% (90% CI -47, -54).
Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., phenytoin, rifampicin, carbamazepine, St. John’s 
Wort) or moderate CYP3A4 inducers with Koselugo should be avoided.
Active substances whose plasma concentrations may be altered by selumetinib
In vitro, selumetinib is an inhibitor of OAT3. The potential for a clinically relevant effect on the 
pharmacokinetics of concomitantly administered substrates of OAT3 (e.g., methotrexate and 
furosemide) cannot be excluded (see section 5.2).
TPGS is a P-gp inhibitor in vitro and it cannot be excluded that it may cause clinically relevant drug 
interactions with substrates of P-gp (e.g., digoxin or fexofenadine). 
The effect of selumetinib on the exposure of oral contraceptives has not been evaluated. Therefore, use 
of an additional barrier method should be recommended to women using hormonal contraceptives (see
section 4.6). 
Effect of gastric acid reducing agents on selumetinib
Selumetinib capsules do not exhibit pH dependent dissolution. Koselugo can be used concomitantly 
with gastric pH modifying agents (i.e., H2-receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors) without 
restrictions, except for omeprazole which is a CYP2C19 inhibitor.
Vitamin E
7
Koselugo capsules contain vitamin E as the excipient TPGS. Therefore, patients should avoid taking 
supplemental vitamin E and anticoagulant assessments should be performed more frequently in 
patients taking concomitant anticoagulant or antiplatelet medicinal products (see section 4.4).
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females
Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving 
Koselugo. It is recommended that a pregnancy test should be performed on women of childbearing 
potential prior to initiating treatment.
Both male and female patients (of reproductive potential) should be advised to use effective 
contraception during and for at least 1 week after completion of treatment with Koselugo. It cannot be 
excluded that selumetinib may reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptives, therefore women using 
hormonal contraceptives should be recommended to add a barrier method (see section 4.5).
Pregnancy
There are no data on the use of selumetinib in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown 
reproductive toxicity including embryofoetal death, structural defects and reduced foetal weights (see 
section 5.3). Koselugo is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential 
not using contraception (see section 4.4).
If a female patient or a female partner of a male patient receiving Koselugo becomes pregnant, she 
should be apprised of the potential risk to the foetus.
Breast-feeding
It is not known whether selumetinib, or its metabolites, are excreted in human milk. Selumetinib and 
its active metabolite are excreted in the milk of lactating mice (see section 5.3). A risk to the breast-fed 
child cannot be excluded, therefore breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with 
Koselugo.
Fertility
There are no data on the effect of Koselugo on human fertility. Selumetinib had no impact on fertility 
and mating performance in male and female mice, although a reduction in embryonic survival was 
observed in female mice (see section 5.3).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Koselugo may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Fatigue, asthenia and 
visual disturbances have been reported during treatment with selumetinib and patients who experience 
these symptoms should observe caution when driving or using machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
The safety profile of selumetinib monotherapy in paediatric patients with NF1 who have inoperable 
PN has been determined following evaluation of a combined safety population of 74 paediatric 
patients (20-30 mg/m2 twice daily). This paediatric ‘pool’ of patients comprised 50 patients in 
SPRINT Phase II Stratum 1, treated with selumetinib 25 mg/m2 twice daily (the pivotal dataset) and 
24 patients in SPRINT Phase I treated with 20 to 30 mg/m2 selumetinib twice daily (the dose finding 
study). There were no clinically relevant differences in the safety profile between SPRINT Phase I and 
SPRINT Phase II Stratum 1. This safety profile was also substantiated by a pool of safety data from 
7 AstraZeneca sponsored studies in adult patients with multiple tumour types (N = 347) who received 
75 to 100 mg twice daily). 
8
In the paediatric pool, the median total duration of selumetinib treatment in paediatric patients with 
NF1 who have PN was 55 months (range: < 1 to 97 months), 61% of patients were exposed to 
selumetinib treatment for > 48 months and 16% for >72 months. Patients aged ≥ 2 to 11 years 
(N = 45) had a higher incidence of the following adverse drug reactions (ADRs) compared to patients 
aged 12 to 18 years (N = 29): hypoalbuminaemia, dry skin, pyrexia, hair colour changes, rash maculo-
papular and paronychia.
In the paediatric pool (N = 74; comprising 50 patients from the pivotal SPRINT Phase II 
Stratum 1 dataset and 24 patients from the supportive SPRINT Phase I dataset), the most common 
adverse reactions of any grade (incidence ≥ 45%) were vomiting (86%), diarrhoea (81%), blood 
creatine phosphokinase increased (77%), nausea (77%), dry skin (65%), pyrexia (61%), dermatitis 
acneiform (61%), asthenic events (59%), paronychia (57%), stomatitis (55%), haemoglobin decreased 
(54%), non-acneiform rashes (53%), hypoalbuminaemia (51%), and aspartate aminotransferase 
increased (51%). Dose interruptions and reductions due to adverse events were reported in 82% and 
39% of patients, respectively. The most commonly reported ADRs leading to dose modification (dose 
interrupted or dose reduced) of selumetinib were vomiting (32%), paronychia (23%), nausea (19%), 
diarrhoea (15%) and pyrexia (11%). Permanent discontinuation due to adverse events was reported in 
12% of the patients. The following serious adverse reactions were reported: diarrhoea (3%), 
anaemia (3%), pyrexia (3%), blood CPK increased (3%), blood creatinine increased (1%), oedema 
peripheral (1%) and vomiting (1%).
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
Table 5 presents the adverse reactions identified in the paediatric population with NF1 who have
inoperable PN and in adult patients (see footnote to Table 5). The frequency is determined from the 
paediatric pool (N = 74); comprising 50 patients from the pivotal SPRINT Phase II Stratum 1 dataset 
and 24 patients from the supportive SPRINT Phase I dataset. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are 
organised by MedDRA system organ class (SOC). Within each SOC, preferred terms are arranged by 
decreasing frequency and then by decreasing seriousness. Frequencies of occurrence of adverse 
reactions are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 
to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated 
from available data), including isolated reports.

Description of selected adverse reactions
Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) reduction 
In SPRINT, Phase II Stratum 1, LVEF reduction (PT: ejection fraction decreased) was reported in 
13 (26%) patients; all cases were grade 2, asymptomatic and did not lead to discontinuation; 
one (2%) case led to dose interruption then reduction. Of the 13 patients, 11 patients recovered and for 
2 patients the outcome was not reported. The median time to first occurrence of LVEF reduction was 
232 days (median duration 252 days). The majority of LVEF reduction adverse reactions were 
reported as reductions from baseline (≥ 10% reduction) but were considered to remain in the normal 
range. Patients with LVEF lower than the institutional LLN at baseline were not included in the 
pivotal study. In addition, a small number of serious cases of LVEF reduction associated with 
selumetinib have been reported in paediatric patients who participated in an expanded access program.
For clinical management of LVEF reduction (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).
Ocular toxicity
In SPRINT, Phase II Stratum 1, grade 1 and 2 adverse reactions of blurred vision were reported in 
7 (14%) patients. Two patients required dose interruption. All adverse reactions were managed 
without dose reduction. For clinical management of new visual disturbances (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).
In addition, a single event of RPED was reported in a paediatric patient receiving selumetinib 
monotherapy (25 mg/m2 twice daily) for pilocytic astrocytoma involving the optic pathway in an 
externally sponsored paediatric study (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).
Paronychia
In SPRINT, Phase II Stratum 1, paronychia was reported in 28 (56%) patients, the median time to first 
onset of maximum grade paronychia adverse reaction was 423 days and the median duration of 
adverse reactions was 51 days. The majority of these adverse reactions were grade 1 or 2 and were 
treated with supportive or symptomatic therapy and/or dose modification. Grade ≥ 3 events occurred 
in 4 (8%) patients. Ten patients (3 with a maximum grade 3 adverse reaction and 7 with a maximum 
grade 2 adverse reaction) had a selumetinib dose interruption for adverse reactions of paronychia, of 
whom 5 had dose interruption followed by dose reduction (2 patients required a second dose 
reduction). In one patient (2%) the event led to discontinuation.
Blood creatine phosphokinase (CPK) increase 
Adverse reactions of blood CPK elevation occurred in 39 (78%) of patients in SPRINT Phase II 
Stratum 1. The median time to first onset of the maximum grade CPK increase was 112 days and the 
median duration of adverse reactions was 153 days. The majority of adverse reactions were grade 1 or 
2 and resolved with no change in selumetinib dose. Grade ≥ 3 adverse reactions occurred in 
3 (6%) patients. A grade 4 adverse reaction led to treatment interruption followed by dose reduction.
Gastrointestinal toxicities
In SPRINT, Phase II Stratum 1, vomiting (43 patients, 86%, median duration 3 days), diarrhoea 
(37 patients, 74%, median duration 6 days), nausea (36 patients, 72%, median duration 15 days), and 
stomatitis (26 patients, 52%, median duration 27 days) were the most commonly reported 
gastrointestinal (GI) reactions. The majority of these cases were grade 1 or 2 and did not require any 
dose interruptionsor dose reductions.
Grade 3 adverse reactions were reported for diarrhoea (8 patients, 16%), nausea (2 patients, 4%), and 
vomiting (4 patients, 8%). For one patient diarrhoea led to dose reduction and subsequent 
discontinuation. No dose reduction or discontinuation was required for adverse reactions of nausea, 
vomiting or stomatitis. 
Skin toxicities
In SPRINT, Phase II Stratum 1, dermatitis acneiform was observed in 28 (56%) patients (median time 
to onset 43 days; median duration of 202 days for the maximum CTCAE grade event). The majority of 
these cases were grade 1 or 2, observed in post-pubertal patients (> 12 years) and did not require any 
dose interruptions or reductions. Grade 3 adverse reactions were reported in 3 (6%) patients.
11
Other (non-acneiform) rashes were observed in 27 (54%) patients in the pivotal study and were 
predominantly grade 1 or 2.
Hair changes
In SPRINT, Phase II Stratum 1, 16 (32%) of patients experienced hair changes (reported as hair 
lightening [PT: hair colour changes] in 12 patients (24%) and hair thinning [PT: alopecia] 
in 12 patients (24%)); in 8 patients (16%) both alopecia and hair colour changes were reported during 
treatment. All cases were grade 1 and did not require dose interruption or dose reduction.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
There is no specific treatment for overdose. If overdose occurs, patients should be closely monitored 
for signs and symptoms of adverse reactions and treated supportively with appropriate monitoring as 
necessary. Dialysis is ineffective in the treatment of overdose.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitor, ATC code: L01EE04
Mechanism of action
Selumetinib is a selective inhibitor of mitogen activated protein kinase kinases 1 and 2 (MEK 1/2).
Selumetinib blocks MEK activity and the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway. Therefore, MEK inhibition can 
block the proliferation and survival of tumour cells in which the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway is 
activated.
Clinical efficacy
The efficacy of Koselugo was evaluated in an open-label, multi-centre, single-arm study (SPRINT)
Phase II Stratum 1 of 50 paediatric patients with NF1 inoperable PN that caused significant morbidity. 
Inoperable PN was defined as a PN that could not be surgically completely removed without risk for 
substantial morbidity due to encasement of, or close proximity to, vital structures, invasiveness, or 
high vascularity of the PN. Patients were excluded for the following ocular toxicities: any current or 
past history of CSR, current or past history of RVO, known intraocular pressure > 21 mmHg (or upper 
limit of normal adjusted by age) or uncontrolled glaucoma. Patients received 25 mg/m2 (BSA) twice 
daily, for 28 days (1 treatment cycle), on a continuous dosing schedule. Treatment was discontinued if 
a patient was no longer deriving clinical benefit, experienced unacceptable toxicity or PN progression, 
or at the discretion of the investigator.
The target PN, the PN that caused relevant clinical symptoms or complications (PN-related 
morbidities), was evaluated for response rate using centrally read volumetric magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) analysis per Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis 
(REiNS) criteria. Tumour response was evaluated at baseline and while on treatment after every 
4 cycles for 2 years, and then every 6 cycles.
Patients had target PN MRI volumetric evaluations and clinical outcome assessments, which included 
functional assessments and patient reported outcomes.
12
At enrolment, the median age of the patients was 10.2 years (range: 3.5 to 17.4 years), 60% were male 
and 84% were Caucasian.
The median target PN volume at baseline was 487.5 mL (range: 5.6 - 3820 mL). PN-related
morbidities that were present in ≥ 20% of patients included disfigurement, motor dysfunction, pain, 
airway dysfunction, visual impairment, and bladder/bowel dysfunction.
The primary efficacy endpoint was objective response rate (ORR), defined as the percentage of 
patients with complete response (defined as disappearance of the target PN) or confirmed partial 
response (defined as ≥ 20% reduction in PN volume, confirmed at a subsequent tumour assessment 
within 3-6 months), based on National Cancer Institute (NCI) centralised review. Duration of response 
(DoR) was also evaluated. 
Efficacy results are provided based on a data cut-off of March 2021, unless stated otherwise.

a Responses required confirmation at least 3 months after the criteria for first partial response were met. 
b Complete response: disappearance of the target lesion; partial response: decrease in target PN volume by

An independent centralized review of tumour response per REiNS criteria (data cut-off June 2018) 
resulted in an ORR of 44% (95% CI: 30.0, 58.7).
The median time to onset of response was 7.2 months (range: 3.3 months to 3.2 years). The median 
(min-max) time to the maximal PN shrinkage from baseline was 15.1 months (range: 3.3 months to 
5.2 years). The median DoR from onset of response was not reached; at the time of data cut-off the 
median follow-up time was 41.3 months. The median time from treatment initiation to disease 
progression while on treatment was not reached.
At the time of data cut-off or last scan on treatment for patients who had discontinued treatment, 
25 (50%) patients remained in confirmed partial response, 1 (2%) had unconfirmed partial responses, 
12 (24%) had stable disease and 10 (20%) had progressive disease.
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Koselugo in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in NF1 PN (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use).
This medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called “conditional approval” scheme. This 
means that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited. The European Medicines Agency 
will review new information on this medicinal product at least every year and this SmPC will be 
updated as necessary.
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
13
At the recommended dose of 25 mg/m2 twice daily in paediatric patients (3 to ≤ 18 years old), the 
geometric mean (coefficient of variation [CV%]) maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) was 
731 (62%) ng/mL and that of the area under the plasma drug concentration curve (AUC0-12) following 
the first dose was 2009 (35%) ng·h/mL. Minimal accumulation of ~1.1-fold was observed at steady 
state upon twice daily dosing.
In paediatric patients, at a dose level of 25 mg/m2, selumetinib has an apparent oral clearance of 
8.8 L/h, mean apparent volume of distribution at steady state of 78 L and mean elimination half-life of 
~6.2 hours. 
Absorption
In healthy adult subjects, the mean absolute oral bioavailability of selumetinib was 62%.
Following oral dosing, selumetinib is rapidly absorbed, producing peak steady state plasma 
concentrations (tmax) between 1-1.5 hours post-dose.
Effect of food 
In separate clinical studies, in healthy adult subjects and in adult patients with advanced solid 
malignancies at a dose of 75 mg, co-administration of selumetinib with a high-fat meal resulted in a 
mean decrease in Cmax of 50% and 62%, respectively, compared to fasting administration. Selumetinib 
mean AUC was reduced by 16% and 19%, respectively, and the time to reach maximum concentration 
(tmax) was delayed by approximately 1.5 to 3 hours (see section 4.2).
In healthy adult subjects at a dose of 50 mg, co-administration of selumetinib with a low-fat meal 
resulted in 60% lower Cmax when compared to fasting administration. Selumetinib AUC was reduced 
by 38%, and the time to reach maximum concentration (tmax) was delayed by approximately 0.9 hours 
(see section 4.2).
In adolescent patients with NF1 and inoperable PN treated with multiple doses of 25 mg/m2 bid, 
co-administration of selumetinib with a low-fat meal resulted in 24% lower Cmax when compared to 
fasting administration. Selumetinib AUC was reduced by 8%, and tmax was delayed by approximately 
0.57 hours (see section 4.2).
A population PK analysis including children and adolescent patients with NF1 and inoperable PN, 
adult patients with advanced solid malignancies and healthy adult subjects taken from 15 studies 
showed that concomitant administration of a low or high fat meal resulted in a mean decrease in the 
exposure (AUC) of selumetinib when compared to fasted administration (23.1% and 20.7%, 
respectively) which was not considered clinically relevant.
Distribution
The mean apparent volume of distribution at steady state of selumetinib across 20 to 30 mg/m2 ranged 
from 78 to 171 L in paediatric patients, indicating moderate distribution into tissue. 
In vitro plasma protein binding is 98.4% in humans. Selumetinib mostly binds to serum albumin 
(96.1%) than α-1 acid glycoprotein (< 35%).
Biotransformation
In vitro, selumetinib undergoes phase 1 metabolic reactions including oxidation of the side chain, 
N-demethylation, and loss of the side chain to form amide and acid metabolites. CYP3A4 is the 
predominant isoform responsible for selumetinib oxidative metabolism with CYP2C19, CYP2C9, 
CYP2E1 and CYP3A5 involved to a lesser extent. In vitro studies indicate that selumetinib also 
undergoes direct phase 2 metabolic reactions to form glucuronide conjugates principally involving the 
enzymes UGT1A1 and UGT1A3. Glucuronidation is a significant route of elimination for selumetinib 
phase 1 metabolites involving several UGT isoforms.
Following oral dosing of 14C-selumetinib to healthy male subjects, unchanged selumetinib (~40% of 
the radioactivity) with other metabolites including glucuronide of imidazoindazole metabolite (M2; 
22%), selumetinib glucuronide (M4; 7%), N-desmethyl selumetinib (M8; 3%), and N-desmethyl 
14
carboxylic acid (M11; 4%) accounted for the majority of the circulating radioactivity in human 
plasma. N-desmethyl selumetinib represents less than 10% of selumetinib levels in human plasma but 
is approximately 3 to 5 times more potent than the parent compound, contributing to about 21% to 
35% of the overall pharmacologic activity.
Interactions
In vitro, selumetinib is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 and CYP2E1. In vitro, selumetinib is not an inducer of CYP1A2 and 
CYP2B6. Selumetinib is an inducer of CYP3A4 in vitro, this is however not expected to be clinically 
relevant. 
In vitro, selumetinib inhibits UGT1A3, UGT1A4, UGT1A6 and UGT1A9 however these effects are
not expected to be clinically relevant.
Interactions with transport proteins
Based on in vitro studies, selumetinib is a substrate for BCRP and P-gp transporters but is unlikely to 
be subjected to clinically relevant drug interactions. In vitro studies suggest that selumetinib does not 
inhibit the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), P-glycoprotein (P-gp), OATP1B1, OATP1B3, 
OCT2, OAT1, MATE1 and MATE2K at the recommended paediatric dose. A clinically relevant effect 
on the pharmacokinetics of concomitantly administered substrates of OAT3 cannot be excluded.
Elimination
In healthy adult subjects, following a single oral 75 mg dose of radiolabelled selumetinib, 59% of the 
dose was recovered in faeces (19% unchanged) while 33% of the administered dose (< 1% as parent) 
was found in urine by 9 days of sample collection.
Special populations
Renal impairment
The exposure of 50 mg oral selumetinib was investigated in adult subjects with normal renal function 
(n = 11) and subjects with ESRD (n = 12). The ESRD group showed 16% and 28% lower Cmax and 
AUC, respectively, with the fraction of unbound selumetinib being 35% higher in ESRD subjects. As 
a result, the unbound Cmax and AUC ratios were 0.97 and 1.13 in the ESRD group when compared to 
the group with normal renal function. A small increase, approximately 20% AUC, in the N-desmethyl 
metabolite to parent ratio was detected in the ESRD group when compared to the normal group. As 
exposure in ESRD subjects was similar to those with normal renal function, investigations in mild, 
moderate and severe renally impaired subjects were not performed. Renal impairment is expected to 
have no meaningful influence on the exposure of selumetinib (see section 4.2).
Hepatic impairment
Adult subjects with normal hepatic function (n = 8) and mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A, 
n = 8) were dosed with 50 mg selumetinib, subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B, 
n = 8) were administered a 50 or 25 mg dose, and subjects with severe hepatic impairment 
(Child-Pugh C, n = 8) were administered a 20 mg dose. Selumetinib total dose normalised AUC and 
unbound AUC were 86% and 69% respectively, in mild hepatic impairment patients, compared to the 
AUC values for subjects with normal hepatic function. Selumetinib exposure (AUC) was higher in 
patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) and severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment; the total AUC 
and unbound AUC values were 159% and 141% (Child-Pugh B) and 157% and 317% (Child-Pugh C), 
respectively, of subjects with normal hepatic function (see section 4.2). There was a trend of lower 
protein binding in subjects with severe hepatic impairment although the protein binding remained 
> 99% (see section 4.3).
Ethnicity
Following a single-dose, selumetinib exposure appears to be higher in Japanese, non-Japanese-Asian 
and Indian healthy adult subjects compared to Western adult subjects, however, there is considerable 
overlap with Western subjects when corrected for body weight or BSA (see section 4.2).
15
Adult patients (> 18 years old)
The PK parameters in adult healthy subjects and adult patients with advanced solid malignancies, are 
similar to those in paediatric patients (3 to ≤ 18 years old) with NF1.
In adult patients, Cmax and AUC increased dose proportionally over a 25 mg to 100 mg dose range.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Genotoxicity
Selumetinib was positive in the mouse micronucleus study via an aneugenic mode of action. The free 
mean exposure (Cmax) at the no observed effect level (NOEL) was approximately 27-times greater than 
clinical free exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 25 mg/m2.
Carcinogenicity
Selumetinib was not carcinogenic in rats or transgenic mice. 
Repeat-dose toxicity
In repeat-dose toxicity studies in mice, rats and monkeys, the main effects seen after selumetinib 
exposure were in the skin, GI tract and bones. Scabs associated with microscopic erosions and 
ulceration at a free exposure similar to the clinical exposure (free AUC) at the MRHD were seen in 
rats. Inflammatory and ulcerative GI tract findings associated with secondary changes in the liver and 
lymphoreticular system at free exposures approximately 28 times the clinical free exposure at the 
MRHD were observed in mice. Growth plate (physeal) dysplasia was seen in male rats dosed for up to 
3 months with selumetinib at a free exposure 11 times the clinical free exposure at the MRHD. 
GI findings showed evidence of reversibility following a recovery period. Reversibility for skin 
toxicities and physeal dysplasia was not evaluated. Vascular engorgement of the corpus cavernosum of 
the bulbocavernosus muscle were observed in male mice in a 26-week study at a dose of 40 mg/kg/day
(28 times the free AUC in humans at the MRHD) leading to significant urinary tract obstruction as 
well as inflammation and luminal hemorrhage of the urethra leading to early death in male mice.
Reproductive toxicology
Developmental and reproduction toxicity studies were conducted in mice. Fertility was not affected in 
male mice at up to 40 mg/kg/day (corresponding to 22-fold the free AUC in humans at the MRHD). In 
females, mating performance and fertility were not affected at up to 75 mg/kg/day, but a reversible 
decrease in the number of live foetuses was observed at this dose level; the NOAEL for effects on 
reproductive performance was 5 mg/kg/day (approximately 3.5-fold the free AUC in humans at the 
MRHD). A treatment-related increase in the incidence of external malformations (open eye, cleft 
palate) was reported in absence of maternal toxicity in embryofoetal development studies at 
> 5 mg/kg/day, and in the pre- and post-natal development study at ≥ 1 mg/kg/day (corresponding to
0.4-fold the free Cmax in humans at the MRHD). The other treatment related effects observed at 
non-maternotoxic dose levels in these studies consisted of embryo-lethality and decreased foetal 
weight at ≥ 25 mg/kg/day (corresponding to 22-fold the free AUC in humans at the MRHD), 
reductions in post-natal pup growth and at weaning a lower number of pups met the pupil constriction 
criterion at 15 mg/kg/day (corresponding to 3.6-fold the free Cmax in humans at the MRHD). 
Selumetinib and its active metabolite were excreted in the milk of lactating mice at concentrations 
approximately the same as those in plasma.

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What Koselugo is and what it is used for
What Koselugo is and how it works
Koselugo contains the active substance selumetinib. 
Selumetinib is a type of medicine called a MEK inhibitor. It works by blocking certain proteins 
involved in the growth of tumour cells. 
Koselugo is expected to shrink tumours that grow along nerves, called plexiform neurofibromas. 
These tumours are caused by a genetic condition called neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).
What Koselugo is used for
Koselugo is used to treat children aged 3 years and above with plexiform neurofibromas that cannot be 
completely removed by surgery.
If you have any questions about how Koselugo works or why this medicine has been prescribed for 
you, ask your doctor.

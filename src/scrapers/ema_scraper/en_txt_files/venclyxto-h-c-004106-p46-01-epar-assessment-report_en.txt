Methods 
Objective(s) 
The primary objectives of the study were: 
• 
• 
Evaluate the safety of venetoclax in combination with navitoclax 
Evaluate the safety of venetoclax in combination with navitoclax and chemotherapy 
•  Determine DLTs of venetoclax, navitoclax, and chemotherapy 
•  Assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of venetoclax in combination with navitoclax 
The secondary objectives of the study were: 
•  Determine the anti-tumour activity of venetoclax in combination with navitoclax 
•  Determine the anti-tumour activity of venetoclax, navitoclax, and chemotherapy, after the first 
cycle of chemotherapy 
•  Determine the number of subjects who proceeded to stem cell transplantation or chimeric 
antigen receptor t-cell (CAR-T) therapy 
•  Changes from baseline in laboratory determinations 
Study design 
This was an open-label, Phase 1 dose escalation study in paediatric and adult subjects with R/R ALL or 
R/R LL.  On Day 1, venetoclax was administered once daily (QD) at the 200 mg adult equivalent dose.  
On Day 2, venetoclax was administered QD at the 400mg adult equivalent dose.  Venetoclax was 
continued QD at the 400 mg adult equivalent dose for 37 weeks. Navitoclax QD dosing began on Day 3 
and continued throughout the 37 weeks treatment period.  Navitoclax was administered at 3 dose 
levels (25, 50, 100 mg) in subjects weighing ≥ 45 kg, and up to 2 dose levels (25, 50 mg) in subjects 
weighing < 45 kg. 
The first subject's first visit occurred on 27 Nov 2017 and the last subject's last visit occurred on 
14 Nov 2020. 
Study population /Sample size 
This study is designed to enrol approximately 50 subjects with relapsed/refractory ALL or 
relapsed/refractory lymphoblastic lymphoma across 15 study centers in the dose escalation portion of 
the study to meet scientific and regulatory objectives without enrolling an undue number of subjects in 
alignment with ethical considerations.  Therefore, if the target number of subjects has been enrolled, 
there is a possibility that additional subjects in Screening will not be enrolled.  In addition, 
approximately 20 additional subjects may be enrolled in a safety expansion cohort. Subjects will 
undergo screening procedures within 28 days prior to initial study drug administration. 
Key Inclusion Criteria

Treatments 
Venetoclax 
On Day 1, venetoclax was administered once daily (QD) at the 200 mg adult equivalent dose. On Day 
2, venetoclax was administered QD at the 400 mg adult equivalent dose. Venetoclax was continued QD 
at the 400 mg adult equivalent dose for 37 weeks. All subjects received venetoclax, adjusted by 
weight, to match the exposure of the adult equivalent target doses as shown in the table below. 
Table 2.  
Venetoclax Dosing Table (mg) 
CHMP comments 
The MAH has used different doses of venetoclax within the different weight groups with the aim “to 
match the exposure of the adult equivalent target doses”. It is however not clear what was the 
actual basis for the calculation/estimation of the proposed venetoclax doses in the two sub-groups of 
study subjects weighing less than 45 kg as proposed by the above mentioned table (i.e. if it was 
prior clinical data in this patient population below 45 kg, modelling and simulation, etc.)

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/425184/2021  
Page 6/25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It is worth noting that 72% (13 out of 18) paediatric subjects which were enrolled in the present 
clinical study belonged to the weight range 20-45 kg, thus requiring adjusted venetoclax doses 
according to the MAH’s study protocol. 
Navitoclax 
For subjects in the dose escalation portion of the study, navitoclax QD dosing began on Day 3 and 
continued throughout the 37-week treatment period. Navitoclax was administered at 3 dose levels 
(DLs) (25, 50, 100 mg) in subjects weighing ≥ 45 kg, and up to 2 dose levels (25, 50 mg) in subjects 
weighing < 45 kg, as shown in the table below. Subjects weighing ≥ 45 kg were the first subjects to 
enrol into the study. These subjects were enrolled at a navitoclax dose of 25 mg (DL1). After 
escalation proceeded to 50 mg (DL2) in the ≥ 45 kg weight group, enrolment of subjects weighing 
< 45 kg began at a navitoclax dose of 25 mg (DL2). 
Table 3.  
Navitoclax Dose Level – Day 3 and Onwards 
Subjects who experienced a 10% change in weight were permitted to increase or decrease to the next 
weight group for the appropriate venetoclax and navitoclax dosing. Subjects who had a 10% decrease 
in weight while receiving 170 mg of venetoclax or 25 mg of navitoclax continued to receive the same 
dose. 
CHMP comments 
According to the MAH, selected doses of navitoclax in the present study were based on previous 
knowledge about its safety profile: “The doses of navitoclax explored in this study (25 to 100 mg) 
were less than the recommended doses (250 to 325 mg) in adult studies and were, therefore, 
expected to decrease the risk of severe thrombocytopenia”. 
Moreover, the MAH has used different doses of navitoclax within the different weight groups. It is 
however not clear what was the actual basis for calculation/estimation of the proposed navitoclax 
doses in the study subjects weighing less than 45 kg (i.e. if it was prior clinical data in this patient 
population below 45 kg, modelling and simulation, etc.) 
Of note, the present study design did not enable/provide PK data for navitoclax alone, i.e. the study 
has only generated PK navitoclax data with the concomitant venetoclax administration. 
Chemotherapy 
Subjects were permitted to begin the following chemotherapy schedule on Day 1. The chemotherapy 
regimen with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) for subjects with ALL with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph+) 
or with an Abelson murine leukemia (ABL) class targetable fusion is detailed in Protocol Section 5.5.2. 
• 
Peg-asparaginase 1,250 International Unit (IU)/m2 (maximum 3,750 IU) intravenous (IV) or 
intramuscular (IM) equivalent, on Day 1 and Day 15. 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/425184/2021  
Page 7/25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
o  For subjects with allergy or intolerance to peg-asparaginase, Erwinia asparaginase was 
acceptable (dosing regimen for Erwinia asparaginase could follow local standard of 
care). 
o  Other forms of asparaginase could be used in place of peg-asparaginase, per local 
standard of care. 
•  Vincristine 1.5 mg/m2 (maximum 2 mg) IV, weekly on Days 1, 8, 15, 22. 
•  Dexamethasone 20 mg/m2/day orally (PO) divided twice daily, on Days 1 to 5 and Days 15 to 
19. 
o  Alternatively, a flat dose of 40 mg once a day was allowed. 
o 
Lower doses of dexamethasone could be given for subjects who were not able to 
tolerate these doses. 
o  The PO equivalent could be given as IV dose. 
o  Alternative steroids could be given if dexamethasone was not tolerated. 
This regimen was permitted to be repeated for a second cycle. Peg-asparaginase (or any other forms 
of asparaginase), vincristine, dexamethasone, and/or TKI may have been delayed, reduced, or omitted 
from the regimen at the discretion of the investigator. Chemotherapy was permitted to continue after 
Cycle 2 at the discretion of the investigator if the subject was remaining on study and receiving clinical 
benefit. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Safety: Adverse event monitoring and laboratory assessments will be summarized throughout the 
study.   
Pharmacokinetic: Pharmacokinetic samples from peripheral blood will be collected for venetoclax and 
navitoclax at designated time points throughout the study.  PK samples from cerebrospinal fluid may 
be collected if a lumbar puncture is performed for clinical reasons.  Pharmacokinetic parameters, 
including maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax), the time to Cmax(peak time, Tmax), area 
under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), and apparent oral clearance (CL/F) will be 
determined as applicable, using non-compartmental methods.  Additional parameters may be 
calculated if useful for data interpretation. 
Efficacy: 
The following efficacy evaluations/endpoints were collected during the study: overall response rate (CR 
+ CRi+ complete response without platelet recovery [CRp] for ALL and CR + partial response [PR] for 
LL), rates of CR, CRi, CRp, PR, progression-free survival (PFS),OS, and minimal residual disease 
(MRD). 
Tumor assessments consisted of bone marrow aspiration with morphological or flow cytometry analysis 
(for ALL subjects or LL subjects with bone marrow involvement), lab collection, physical exam (data 
from physical exam was not captured in electronic data capture [EDC]), and when clinically indicated, 
bone marrow biopsy, and radiographic imaging, if appropriate (computed tomography [CT] scan, 
magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], or positron emission tomography [PET]).  Tumour assessments for 
LL subjects required radiographic imaging.  Minimal residual disease assessment in peripheral blood 
and/or bone marrow by flow cytometry, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), or sequencing

of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH)/T cell receptor (TCR) rearrangements was performed by local 
laboratories on available samples at times of disease assessment, if clinically indicated.  Minimal 
residual disease negativity was defined as less than 10–4 threshold. 
Biomarkers: 
Exploratory research will be conducted to study biomarkers that may be associated with PK, safety 
and/or efficacy.  Peripheral blood and bone marrow will be collected for biomarker research at 
designated time points throughout the study. 
CHMP comment: 
The endpoints are acceptable for the proposed study design. 
Statistical Methods 
Safety 
Safety analyses will be performed for all subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug.  Safety 
will be assessed by evaluating study drug exposure, adverse events, serious adverse events, deaths, 
and changes from baseline in laboratory determinations. 
Pharmacokinetic 
Plasma concentrations and pharmacokinetic parameter values for venetoclax and navitoclax (and 
possible metabolite[s]) will be tabulated for each subject and each dose combination.  Summary 
statistics will be computed for each sampling time and each pharmacokinetic parameter.  Additional 
analyses may be performed if useful and appropriate.  
Efficacy 
The following efficacy analyses will be completed for subjects who receive at least one dose of 
venetoclax:  objective response rate:(CR + CRi + CRp) for ALL and (CR + PR) for LL, CR rate, PR rate, 
and MRD status.  Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) will be evaluated. 
CHMP comment: 
All analyses were descriptive or exploratory in nature. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 69 subjects, including 36 with B cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL), 27 with T cell 
acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL), and 6 with LL were enrolled in the study (table 4).  Eighteen 
paediatric subjects and 51 adult subjects were enrolled.  Forty-seven subjects were included in the 
dose escalation portion of the study and 22 subjects were included in the safety expansion cohort. 
All subjects discontinued the study for 1 or more reasons. Reasons for study discontinuation were 
similar across primary disease type, age, dose escalation cohort, and safety expansion cohort. The 
most common (> 10% of subjects) primary reasons for study discontinuation across all subjects were 
death (71.0%) and study termination by the Sponsor (26.1%). Of note, all subjects who discontinued 
due to study termination by the Sponsor were in survival follow-up, not actively dosing. One adult 
subject enrolled in DL3 discontinued from the study due to non-compliance after receiving 1 dose of

venetoclax and never received any navitoclax. Hence, for the purpose of the data analysis, this subject 
is included in the "total" column, but not the DL3 dose cohort. 
The study was terminated as planned after the last subject received study drug for 37 weeks. 
A total of 14 sites in the US and Australia participated in this study.

Pharmacokinetic results 
Venetoclax Pharmacokinetics 
The overall mean + SD venetoclax plasma concentration-time profiles obtained at Days 1, 2, 3, 8, and 
9 across all study subjects are presented on a linear scale in the figure below. Venetoclax plasma 
concentrations peaked at approximately 6 to 8 hours (median Tmax). The arithmetic mean ± SD Cmax 
and AUC24 for a 400 mg equivalent dose at steady state (Cycle 1 Day 8) were 1.92 ± 1.53 μg/mL and 
30.0 ± 25.2 μgh/mL, respectively.

Venetoclax PK parameters presented by navitoclax dose level (25, 50 or 100 mg) and two weight 
groups (20 to <45 kg, and ≥45 kg) at Day 8 across dose escalation and safety expansion phases 
combined are shown in the table below.

Day 8 presented by Navitoclax Dose Level, and Weight Group. 
Overall, based on the available PK data the MAH has concluded that pharmacokinetic exposures of 
400 mg equivalent dose of venetoclax were comparable across different navitoclax dose levels and 
weight groups. Furthermore, MAH concludes that venetoclax PK was not affected by coadministration 
of navitoclax.

CHMP comments 
Venetoclax exposure appeared to increase dose-proportionally from Day 1 (200 mg dose) to Day 2 
(400 mg) and showed some accumulation after reaching its expected steady state at Day 8. This is 
in accordance with venetoclax PK properties as stated in its current SmPC.  
Only Cmax, Tmax and corresponding AUC parameters were presented. No CL, t1/2 or other relevant PK 
parameters were provided based on the PK data obtained in the present study. 
Venetoclax exposure appeared to be slightly lower in paediatric patients weighing less than 45 kg 
(i.e. study subjects with the adjusted venetoclax dosing) compared to the corresponding venetoclax 
exposures in adults weighing ≥45 kg (e.g. differences observed in AUC and Cmax values obtained at 
Day 1 and Day 2). However, due to the limited number of study subjects as well as the variability in 
PK parameters, it is difficult to draw conclusions whether the dose adjustment for venetoclax in sub-
groups weighing less than 45 kg was appropriately selected. 
The MAH has concluded that venetoclax PK was not affected by the coadministration of navitoclax. 
However, this conclusion can only be partially agreed on because the present study was not 
designed in accordance with the EMA DDI guideline to be able to make statements about potentially 
present PK interactions. The present study has provided venetoclax data at steady-state (i.e. Day 8) 
with the co-administration of navitoclax, however no corresponding data for venetoclax alone at 
steady-state (i.e. Day 8) were generated within the same study to make relevant comparisons. 
Moreover, it is not clear whether venetoclax (as a perpetrator drug) could also potentially impact the 
PK of navitoclax, and this cannot be answered by the present study design because it did not 
generate navitoclax PK data alone (i.e. data without co-administered venetoclax). Importantly, 
navitoclax is not an approved agent at present, and it is therefore unclear which enzymes, 
transporters and/or other factors could impact its disposition and thereby be responsible for the 
potential pharmacokinetic interactions. Finally, it is also worth mentioning that the present study 
design also allowed for simultaneous administration of other drug therapies (i.e. chemotherapy 
regimen as described in the study protocol) which makes the data interpretation more difficult in 
terms of potentially present pharmacokinetic interactions. 
Navitoclax Pharmacokinetics 
The mean + SD navitoclax plasma concentration-time profiles for Days 3, 8, and 9 obtained with 
different dose levels (25, 50 and 100 mg) are presented on a linear scale in the figures below. 
Navitoclax plasma concentrations peaked at approximately 6 to 8 hours (median Tmax) across all three 
dose levels. The arithmetic mean ± SD Cmax values at steady state (Cycle 1 Day 8) for the three dose 
levels were 0.390 ± 0.244, 1.29 ± 0.971, and 1.95 ± 1.35 μg/mL, respectively and the AUC24 values 
at steady state (Cycle 1 Day 8) for the three dose levels were 5.92 ± 3.48, 19.9 ± 16.4, and 27.6 ± 
17.1 μgh/mL, respectively.

CHMP comments 
When considering overall data for navitoclax, it appears that its exposure was not increasing 
proportionally between the three dose levels (25, 50 and 100 mg).  
Only Cmax, Tmax and corresponding AUC parameters were presented. No CL, t1/2 or other relevant PK 
parameters were provided based on the PK data obtained in the present study. 
Navitoclax is not approved agent at present, and it is therefore unclear which enzymes, transporters 
and/or other factors could impact its disposition and thereby be responsible for the potential 
pharmacokinetic interactions. As already mentioned above, it is not clear whether venetoclax (as a 
perpetrator drug) could also potentially impact the PK of navitoclax (as a victim drug). This cannot

Across all subjects, the ORR was 66.7% (95% CI: 54.3% to 77.6%) and ranged from 47.4% to 81.8% 
across cohorts (Table 9). The ORR was higher among pediatric than adult subjects, higher among 
subjects with B-ALL or LL than subjects with T-ALL, and higher among subjects enrolled in the DL1 or 
DL2 dose cohorts than subjects enrolled in the DL3 dose or safety expansion cohorts. 
Complete Remission 
Across all subjects, the CR rate (including CR, CRi, or CRp) was 56.5% (95% CI: 44.0% to 68.4%) and 
ranged from 42.1% to 75.0% across study cohorts (Table 9). The pattern of results for the CR rate for 
subgroups generally paralleled that observed with the ORR. The CR rate was high and similar among 
pediatric and adult subjects, higher among subjects with B-ALL or LL than subjects with T-ALL, and 
higher among subjects enrolled in the DL1 or DL2 dose cohorts than subjects enrolled in the DL3 dose 
or the safety expansion cohort. 
For subjects who achieved CR, the estimated median DoCR across all subjects was 6.5 months (95% 
CI: 2.1 to 9.5 months) and ranged from 2.1 to 10.3 months across cohorts (Table 10). Estimated 
median DoCR were similar among paediatric and adult subjects, longer among subjects with B-ALL 
than subjects with T-ALL or LL, and longer among subjects enrolled in the DL2 or DL3 dose cohorts 
than subjects enrolled in the DL1 dose or safety expansion cohorts.

Overall survival 
Across all subjects, the estimated median OS was 6.6 months (95% CI: 4.0 to 9.7 months) and ranged 
from 4.3 to 11.4 months across cohorts (Table 11). The estimated median OS was higher among 
paediatric than adult subjects, higher among subjects with B-ALL or LL than subjects with T-ALL, and 
higher among subjects enrolled in the DL1 or DL2 dose cohorts than subjects enrolled in the DL3 dose 
or safety expansion cohorts.

Progression-Free Survival 
Across all subjects, the estimated median duration of PFS was 3.0 months (95% CI: 1.8 to 4.7 
months) and ranged from 1.7 to 8.8 months across cohorts (Table 12). The estimated median duration 
of PFS was lower among paediatric subjects than adult subjects, higher among subjects with B-ALL 
than subjects with T-ALL or LL, and higher among subjects enrolled in the DL1 and DL2 dose cohorts 
than subjects enrolled in the DL3 dose or the safety expansion cohorts. 
Use of Subsequent Therapy 
Data on the use of subsequent SCT and CAR-T therapy are presented in Table 13. Across all subjects, 
18.8% of subjects received subsequent SCT therapy and 7.2% of subjects received subsequent CAR-T 
therapy. Rates of proceeding to subsequent SCT or CAR-T therapy were higher among pediatric than 
adult subjects. 
Evaluations of the MRD conducted during this study were considered to be exploratory in nature. 
Across all subjects, the MRD negativity rate was 11.6% (95% CI: 5.1% to 21.6%) and ranged from 
0% to 27.8% across cohorts. The MRD negativity rate was higher among pediatric than adult subjects 
and higher among subjects with B-ALL than subjects with T-ALL or LL. The MRD negativity rate among 
subjects achieving CR/CRi/CRp was 20.5%, whereas no subjects achieving PR or other responses 
achieved MRD negativity.

The efficacy conclusions from this study are as follows: 
•  Across all treated subjects, the ORR and CR rates were 66.7% and 56.5%, respectively, with 
an estimated median DoR and DoCR of 3.8 and 6.5 months, respectively. 
• 
The median OS was 6.6 months, and the median PFS was 3.0 months. 
•  Approximately 18.8% of subjects received subsequent SCT and 7.2% received subsequent 
CAR-T therapy. 
•  Across all subjects, exploratory analyses of MRD status revealed a bone marrow MRD 
negativity rate of 11.6%. The MRD negativity rate among subjects achieving CR/CRi/CRp was 
20.5%. 
• 
Examination of efficacy parameters in subgroups of subjects based on age, disease, and dose 
level revealed differences between subgroups: 
o  Age: Although the rates of response were generally high and DoR and DoCR were 
similar between paediatric and adult subjects, the duration of OS was higher among 
paediatric subjects, and the duration of PFS was higher among adult subjects. In 
addition, the percentage of subjects proceeding to subsequent SCT or CAR-T therapy 
and achieving MRD negativity was higher for paediatric than adult subjects. 
o  Disease: For all efficacy parameters assessed, efficacy was greater among subjects 
with B-ALL than among subjects with T-ALL. 
o  Dose level: The ORR, OS rate and duration, and PFS rate and duration were higher 
among subjects in DL1 and DL2 cohorts compared with DL3 or safety expansion 
cohorts. In addition, a greater proportion of subjects in DL2 than the other cohorts 
proceeded to subsequent SCT or CAR-T. 
•  Overall, the treatment regimen of venetoclax and navitoclax with chemotherapy showed 
evidence of anti-tumour activity in paediatric and adult subjects with R/R ALL or R/R LL. 
CHMP comments 
Across all treated subjects, the ORR and CR rates were 66.7% and 56.5%, respectively, with an 
estimated median DoR and DoCR of 3.8 and 6.5 months, respectively. The median OS was 6.6 months, 
and the median PFS was 3.0 months. 
Although the rates of response were generally high and DoR and DoCR were similar between paediatric 
and adult subjects, the duration of OS was higher among paediatric subjects, and the duration of PFS 
was higher among adult subjects. The higher percentage of paediatric subjects compared to adults 
proceeded to subsequent SCT or CAR-T therapy and achieved MRD negativity. 
With regard to the disease, efficacy was greater among subjects with B-ALL than among subjects with 
T-ALL. 
The ORR, OS rate and duration, and PFS rate and duration were higher among subjects in DL1 and DL2 
cohorts compared with DL3 or safety expansion cohorts. In addition, a greater proportion of subjects in 
DL2 than the other cohorts proceeded to subsequent SCT or CAR-T. 
However, taking into account very limited number of patients in different age or disease groups, no 
conclusion on efficacy can be made.

Safety results 
All 69 subjects reported at least 1 treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) during the study. The 
most commonly reported (≥ 40% of subjects overall) TEAEs were hypokalaemia, nausea, diarrhoea, 
febrile neutropenia, abdominal pain, and vomiting. A majority (97.1%) of subjects reported Grade 3 or 
4 TEAEs. The most commonly reported (> 20% of subjects overall) Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs were febrile 
neutropenia, neutropenia, anaemia, hypokalaemia, and increased alanine aminotransferase. Similar 
proportions of subjects had TEAEs that were considered by the investigator to have a reasonable 
possibility of being related to venetoclax or navitoclax (79.7% vs. 73.9%, respectively) 
Table 14. Overview of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (All Treated Subjects) 
A total of 52 subjects (75.4%) had at least 1 serious adverse event (SAE). The most commonly 
reported (> 5% of subjects) SAEs were febrile neutropenia, sepsis, septic shock, pneumonia, and 
upper respiratory tract infection. Safety results are summarized in Table 15, with the most commonly 
reported TEAEs and SAEs shown.

There were 49 deaths (71.0%) during the study. Thirty-seven subject deaths were due to disease 
progression. Ten treatment-emergent fatal adverse events were reported in adult subjects, with 1 
subject reporting more than 1 event leading to death. Aside from sepsis (3 subjects, 4.3%) and septic 
shock (2 subjects, 2.9%), all TEAEs leading to death were reported in a single subject each. Three

subjects experienced 4 fatal events that were considered to have a reasonable possibility of being 
related to study drug or chemotherapy. One subject had a fatal event of intestinal ischemia that was 
considered related to venetoclax, navitoclax, and asparaginase. One subject had a fatal event of 
multiple organ dysfunction syndrome considered related to the study drug combination venetoclax, 
navitoclax, vincristine, and asparaginase; this subject also had a fatal event of pneumonia considered 
related to asparaginase. One subject had a fatal event of sepsis that was considered related to 
dexamethasone and asparaginase. 
Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were reported in 8 subjects in this study (5 adult subjects and 3 
pediatric subjects). At dose level (DL) 3 (50 mg navitoclax for < 45 kg and 100 mg navitoclax for ≥ 45 
kg), for subjects < 45 kg, 2 of 4 DLT-evaluable subjects had DLTs. For subjects ≥ 45 kg at DL3, 3 of 9 
DLT-evaluable subjects had DLTs. Dose level 3 was deemed by the Sponsor and the principal 
investigators to be too toxic for subjects < 45 kg. For subjects ≥ 45 kg, with 3 DLTs in 9 evaluable 
patients, additional patients could have been enrolled to assess if this dose was too toxic; however, 
due to the higher efficacy observed in DL2 and the trend to more toxicity, DL2 (25 mg navitoclax for < 
45 kg and 50 mg navitoclax for ≥ 45 kg) was deemed the maximally tolerated dose and the 
recommended dose for future studies. 
CHMP comments 
All subjects experienced at least one TEAE. A majority (97.1%) of subjects reported Grade 3 or 4 
TEAEs. The most commonly reported Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs were febrile neutropenia, neutropenia, 
anaemia, hypokalaemia, and increased alanine aminotransferase. At least one SAE was reported by 
52 subjects. The most commonly reported SAEs were febrile neutropenia, sepsis, septic shock, 
pneumonia, and upper respiratory tract infection. There were 49 deaths (71.0%) during the study. 
Thirty-seven subject deaths were due to disease progression. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were 
reported in 8 subjects in this study (5 adult subjects and 3 paediatric subjects). 
All subjects in this study were heavily pre-treated, all of them had at least 1 prior antitumor therapy, 
with the number of prior cancer therapy regimens ranging from 1 to 12. Overall, 23 subjects had prior 
transplant and 10 subjects had prior CAR-T therapy. The use of chemotherapy was also permitted 
during the study.  
Venetoclax was used in combination with navitoclax and chemotherapy in this study in patients with 
R/R T-ALL, B-ALL and LL (unapproved indications). Navitoclax is an experimental medicine, not yet 
approved, and its safety profile is not established. Despite this, the observed safety profile was 
consistent with the known safety profile of venetoclax. No new safety signals were identified.

All 18 paediatric subjects experienced at least 1 TEAE.  The most commonly reported (> 40% of 
subjects) TEAEs in paediatric subjects were febrile neutropenia, hyperglycaemia, hyperkalaemia, and 
vomiting.  A majority (88.9%) of paediatric subjects reported Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs.  The most 
commonly reported (> 20% of subjects) Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs included anaemia, febrile neutropenia, 
leukopenia, neutropenia, and hyperglycaemia.  Eleven paediatric subjects (61.1%) experienced at 
least 1 TEAE with a reasonable possibility of being related to venetoclax or navitoclax. 
A total of 12 paediatric subjects (66.7%) experienced at least 1 SAE.  The most commonly reported 
(> 10% of paediatric subjects) SAEs were febrile neutropenia, sepsis, and septic shock.  All other SAEs 
occurred in 1 paediatric subject each.  No paediatric subjects died due to AEs during the study.  Safety

Based on these data, no additional safety measures are judged to be necessary. 
CHMP comments 
Eighteen paediatric patients aged 6-18 years have been enrolled to the study. Median exposure to 
venetoclax and navitoclax was 43 days (1-148 days and 5-146 days respectively). Efficacy and safety 
results were similar to those of adults. However, due to limited number of subjects no firm conclusion 
can be made. 
2.3.2.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Pharmacokinetics 
The MAH has concluded that venetoclax PK was not affected by the coadministration of navitoclax. 
However, this conclusion can only be partially agreed on because the present study was not designed 
in accordance with the EMA DDI guideline to be able to make clear statements about potentially 
present PK interactions. Therefore, a dedicated clinical DDI study in accordance with the current EMA 
DDI guideline might be required to elucidate potentially present (mutual) PK interaction(s) between 
venetoclax and navitoclax. Importantly, navitoclax is not an approved agent at present, and it is 
therefore unclear which enzymes, transporters and/or other factors could impact its disposition and 
thereby be responsible for the potentially present pharmacokinetic interactions. 
Efficacy and safety 
The study M16-106 was an open-label, Phase 1 dose escalation study in paediatric and adult subjects 
with R/R ALL or R/R LL. These are unapproved indication for venetoclax. Navitoclax is not approved for 
any indication yet.  
Sixty-nine subjects were enrolled to the study, eighteen of them were paediatric patients aged 6 to 
18 years. Out of 69 subjects, 36 were with B cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL), 27 with T cell 
acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL), and 6 with LL. Forty-seven subjects were included in the dose 
escalation portion of the study and 22 subjects were included in the safety expansion cohort.  
Overall, the combination of venetoclax and navitoclax with chemotherapy was tolerated in both 
paediatric and adult subjects with relapsed/refractory (R/R) ALL or R/R LL. The observed safety profile 
was consistent with the known safety profile of venetoclax. No new safety signals were identified. The 
treatment regimen of venetoclax and navitoclax with chemotherapy showed preliminary clinical 
evidence of anti-tumour activity in paediatric and adult subjects with R/R ALL or R/R LL. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

Information on Paediatric requirements 
This application has been subject to a PIP compliance verification (Compliance report EMEA-C2-
000827-PIP01-09-M01). 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP was not yet completed as some measures were 
deferred. 
The PDCO issued an opinion on partial/interim compliance. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
The present type II variation EMEA/H/C/000996/II/0018 pertains to  
1.  the extension (to include paediatric patients aged 6 years to 17 years) and rewording of the 
currently approved indication,  
2.  change of posology based on long term data and  
3.  to include appropriate information in sections 4.4 and 5.1 of the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC). 
The CHMP issued a final positive Opinion for granting a conditional Marketing Authorisation to Cayston 
on 21 September 2009. The conditional Marketing Authorisation was renewed on 26 August 2010. On 
5 September 2011 the conditional marketing authorisation was lifted in a marketing authorisation not 
subject to specific obligations. 
The product was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/04/204 on 21 June 2004. 
Cayston is currently available in the following EU countries:

Assessment report  
EMA/571864/2012  
Page 4/80
 
 
 
 
 
 
from 01 September 2011: Spain 
Furthermore Cayston is available on a named-patient or equivalent programme in several other EU 
countries. 
Currently approved indication(s): Cayston is indicated for the suppressive therapy of chronic 
pulmonary infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) aged  
18 years and older. 
The primary support for this indication is based on two single 28-day course placebo-controlled 
studies.  The data to support the sustainability of the observed short term benefit over subsequent 
courses of treatment are limited (see section 5.1). Consideration should be given to official guidance 
on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. 
Posology: The currently recommended standard dosage of Cayston is limited to adults. The 
recommended dose is 75 mg three times per 24 hours for 28 days. Doses should be taken at least 
4 hours apart. 
Multiple course, controlled efficacy data are not yet available (see section 5.1).  Additional courses, 
beyond the initial 28-day course, should be considered only at the discretion of the physician.  If 
additional courses are prescribed, a minimum of 28 days without Cayston is recommended. 
Paediatric development 
Paediatric development is ongoing in PA infected paediatric CF patients.  
Seven phase 2/3 Gilead-sponsored clinical studies of aztreonam lysine (AZLI) which included paediatric 
patients aged 6 years and older have been completed (CP-AI-003, CP-AI-005, CP-AI-007, CP-AI-006, 
GS-US-205-0117, GS-US-205-0110 and EA-US-205-0111), and one study is ongoing (EA-US-205-
0122).  
The approved Cayston PIP includes an exploratory Phase 2 study (GS-US-205-XXX1 [GS-US-205-
0162]), a deferral to conduct a subsequent Phase 3 study (GS US 205-XXX2) to evaluate initial PA 
infection in paediatric subjects (aged 3 months to 17 years), a Phase 3 study (GS-US-205-XXX3 [GS-
US-205-0160]) to evaluate long-term safety in paediatric subjects (aged less than 13 years) with 
chronic PA infection/colonization, and completed study GS-US-205-0110, which included children with 
CF 6 years or older. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Aztreonam Lysine 75 mg Powder and solvent for Nebuliser Solution is a novel formulation of the 
monobactam antibiotic aztreonam, developed by Gilead for aerosol administration. Aztreonam has 
been approved for IV administration (Azactam) in the EU in the 1980’s. The approved formulation 
contains approximately 780 mg arginine per gram of aztreonam. However, aerosolized arginine has 
been tested as a mucolytic in CF patients, and was shown to be unsafe, resulting in inflammatory 
adverse reactions when inhaled by CF patients. The applicant developed a lysine salt of aztreonam, 
Aztreonam lysine (AZLI) in order to eliminate the inflammatory component of the IV (arginine 
containing) formulation, making it suitable for airway administration, while preserving its antimicrobial 
activity against P. aeruginosa. 
AZLI is administered with the eFlow family of electronic nebulizers (Altera) with a handset customized 
for the delivery of AZLI. The Altera is a nebulizer that uses a vibrating perforated membrane to 
generate the aerosol. Conventional nebulizers use pneumatic processes to generate the aerosol, 
Assessment report  
EMA/571864/2012  
Page 5/80
 
 
 
 
requiring bulky compressors or a compressed air source. The Altera creates an aerosol using a 
vibrating membrane that has over 4,000 holes. The membrane is driven by a piezoelectric crystal, 
allowing the nebulizer to be battery powered and portable. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
General comments on compliance with GMP, GLP, GCP 
In the original MAA the MAH states that trials were performed with the ethical principles that are 
consistent with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and according to the International Conference on 
Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines. 
Significant problems have been detected in one of the approved manufacturing sites of the finished 
product, Ben Venue Laboratories Inc. at 650 Cliffside Drive in San Dimas, California.  Gilead Sciences 
International Ltd. notified EMA about the intent to delete Ben Venue Laboratories Inc as manufacturer 
site (grouped type IA variation).  Following review of the notification, a favourable opinion on the 
deletion of aforementioned manufacturer was provided on 11 May 2012.  
2.1.4.  Type of application and other comments on the submitted dossier 


2.2.  Quality  aspects 
No new data were submitted. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new data were submitted. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
No new efficacy data has been put forward by the Marketing Authorisation holder (MAH). Subgroup 
analyses of already available data in paediatric patients have been performed and evaluated separately 
by the MAH. 
During the initial MAA, CP-AI-005, CP-AI-007 and then ongoing CP-AI-006 were assessed. In the 
Rapporteur’s first (annual) renewal assessment report dated 31 March 2010 
(EMEA/H/C/000996/R/0006), the clinical efficacy with respect to Study CP-AI-006, Study GS-US-205-
0117 (AIR-CF4) and the, at that moment, ongoing Study GS-US-205-0110 were thoroughly discussed. 
During the last annual renewal (EMEA/H/C/000996/R/0015) Specific Obligation (SO2), Study GS-US-
Assessment report  
EMA/571864/2012

205-0110 was assessed. 
Furthermore, on 19 August 2011, the safety data from study EA-US-205-0111 (eCTD sequence 0076) 
was submitted, which is regarded as supportive. 
The following sections review the efficacy data of AZLI in paediatric patients (< 18 years of age) 
enrolled in completed controlled efficacy studies (CP-AI-003, CP-AI-005, CP-AI-007, GS-US-205-0117, 
and GS-US-205-0110). In addition, while not controlled, Study CP-AI-006 was an open-label extension 
study of up to 9 courses of AZLI in 274 subjects who had participated in studies CP-AI-005 and CP-AI-
007; therefore, data from this study are also presented. For background information a short summary 
is provided for each efficacy study.

2.4.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Children 
Literature data indicates no significant age dependency in the pharmacokinetics following i.v. 
administration, besides the influence of renal function. 
Study -002 included adolescent CF patients, whose sputum aztreonam concentrations were evaluated 
after a single 75 mg inhalation dose. In studies -003, -005 and -007, children and adolescents were 
included, receiving b.i.d. or t.i.d. treatment of aztreonam by inhalation. Pooled data show no difference 
in aztreonam plasma concentrations between adolescents and adults (Table PK 1). In children there is 
some indication of lower aztreonam plasma concentrations. For aztreonam measured in sputum, no 
clear difference was observed between the different age groups. 
Table PK 1: 
Plasma aztreonam concentrations 1 h post-dose by age in studies -003, -005 and -007. 
No clear differences in plasma and sputum aztreonam concentrations are observed between children, 
adolescents and adults; however this conclusion is hampered due to the high inter-subject variability.  
The proposed SmPC indicates that the posology in children > 6 years of age is the same as for adults, 
and that dosage is not based on weight or adjusted for age. Taking into account the indication and the 
low systemic exposure after inhalation, this is considered acceptable, based upon a pharmacokinetic 
point of view.

2.4.2.  Clinical efficacy aspects 
Dose-response studies and main clinical studies 
Overview 
GS-US-205-0110 (long term study) 
In GS-US-205-0110, 268 patients with CF and chronic P. aeruginosa lung infection were randomised 
and received Cayston (N=136) or Tobramycin Nebuliser Solution (TNS) (N=132).  Fifty-nine paediatric 
patients aged 6 to 17 years were included in the trial.  Patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to 
receive either Cayston (75 mg) administered by inhalation 3 times a day or TNS (300 mg) 
administered 2 times a day.  Treatments were administered for three cycles of 28 days on therapy 
followed by 28 days off therapy.  The co-primary endpoints were non-inferiority of Cayston to TNS in 
relative change from baseline to Day 28 in Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) % predicted 
and superiority of Cayston to TNS in actual change from baseline in FEV1 % predicted across 
3 treatment courses (the average of the actual change in FEV1 % predicted observed at the end of 
each treatment course). 
The secondary endpoints in this study were: 
  Relative change from baseline in FEV1 percent predicted at Day 28 in subjects who received 
inhaled tobramycin for ≥84 days in the 12 months prior to study enrollment (non-inferiority 
analysis) 
  Actual change from baseline in FEV1 percent predicted across 3 treatment courses in subjects who 
received inhaled tobramycin for ≥84 days in the 12 months prior to study enrollment (superiority 
analysis) 
  Time to need for IV antipseudomonal antibiotic for respiratory events among all subjects 
(superiority analysis) 
  Time to first respiratory hospitalisation among all subjects (superiority analysis)  
The tertiary efficacy endpoints were as follows: 
  Change from baseline in FEV1 percent predicted at each study visit (exclusive of Day 28)  
  Change from baseline in FEV1, FVC (forced vital capacity), and FEF25-75 (forced expiratory flow 
during the middle half of the forced vital capacity) at each study visit  
  Change from baseline in Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire Quality of Life – Revised (CFQ R) Respiratory 
Symptoms Scale (RSS) at each study visit  
  Change from baseline in other domains as assessed by the CFQ-R at each study visit 
  Hospitalizations Days 0 to 168  
  Use of additional antipseudomonal antibiotics (other than randomized treatment) Days 0 to 168  
  Change in weight/body mass index (BMI) at Week 20  
  Missed school/work days, Days 0 to 168  
  Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) at Day 28 and either Day 140 or Early 
Termination (ET)

CP-AI-007 
CP-AI-007 enrolled 164 adult (predominantly) and paediatric patients randomised in a 1:1 ratio 
comparing inhaled Cayston 75 mg (80 patients) or placebo (84 patients) administered 3 times a day 
for 28 days (one course).  Patients were required to have been off antipseudomonal antibiotics for at 
least 28 days before treatment with study drug. 
Pulmonary function and respiratory symptoms significantly improved from baseline to Day 28 in 
patients treated with one course of Cayston. 
CP-AI-005 
CP-AI-005 enrolled 246 adult (predominantly) and paediatric patients.  All patients were treated with 
Tobramycin Nebuliser Solution (TNS) 300 mg, 2 times a day in the four weeks immediately prior to 
receiving Cayston or placebo either 2 or 3 times a day for 28 days.  Patients continued on their 
baseline medications, including macrolide antibiotics.  Patients were randomised in a 2:2:1:1 ratio to 
be treated with Cayston 75 mg 2 or 3 times a day or volume-matched placebo 2 or 3 times a day for 
28 days immediately following the 28-day lead-in course of open-label TNS. 
Cayston therapy resulted in significant improvements in pulmonary function and respiratory symptoms 
at Day 28 in the 66 patients treated with one course Cayston 75 mg 3 times a day. 
CP-AI-006 (long term study) 
CP-AI-006 was an open-label follow-on study to CP-AI-005 and CP-AI-007 evaluating the safety of 
repeated exposure to Cayston and the effect on disease-related endpoints over multiple 28-day 
courses.  Patients received Cayston at the same frequency (2 or 3 times a day) as they took Cayston 
or placebo in the randomised studies.  Patients continued on their baseline medications and whenever 
indicated additional antibiotics were used in the majority of patients to treat exacerbations.  Each 
28-day course of Cayston was followed by a 28-day off drug period.  Over nine 28-day courses of 
therapy, measures of pulmonary function (FEV1), CFQ-R respiratory symptoms scores, and 
P. aeruginosa sputum density showed a trend to improvement while the patients were on treatment 
compared with off treatment.  However, due to the uncontrolled nature of the study and concomitant 
medications no conclusion can be drawn on the sustainability of the observed short term benefit over 
subsequent courses of treatment. 
Review of Efficacy Results in Paediatric patients 
In total, 179 unique paediatric patients (49 subjects aged 6 to 12 years, 130 subjects aged 13 to 
17 years) have received AZLI in these trials (Table 2). The numbers of paediatric patients included in 
each efficacy study are summarized below. The reported efficacy results are reported in table 3a-3c.

Dose finding and short term studies 
Study CP-AI-003 
Study CP-AI-003 enrolled 27 (26%) paediatric patients (13 to 17 years old). Overall, 6 paediatric 
patients were treated with placebo, 9 were treated with 75 mg AZLI twice daily (BID), and 12 were 
treated with 225 mg AZLI BID. Among the 27 paediatric patients, 4 subjects had baseline FEV1 < 75% 
predicted and 23 subjects had baseline FEV1 ≥ 75% predicted. 
Among paediatric patients, there was a mean increase in percent change in FEV1 from Day 0 to Day 14 
in the AZLI treatment groups and a slight decline in the placebo group (-1.2% in the placebo group, 
9.1% in the 75 mg AZLI BID group, and 3.4% in the 225 mg AZLI BID group). 
A statistically significant mean reduction in log10 PA CFU/g was observed in the overall study 
population in both AZLI treatment groups compared with placebo following a 14-day treatment course. 
At Day 14, the mean (confidence interval [CI]; p-value) difference between AZLI and placebo in 
change in log10 PA CFU/g was -1.6 (-2.4, -0.7; p = 0.0005) for the 75 mg AZLI group and -2.3 (
1.5; p < 0.0001) for the 225 mg AZL
I group.

Comment: 
Study CP-AI-003 was a dose finding 75 mg AZLI BID versus 225 mg AZLI BID. The ITT population 
included 105 patients of which only 9 paediatric patients (13-17 years; none in the age group 6-12 
years) were treated with AZLI 75 mg BID. Compared to placebo this group showed a mean percentage 
change in FEV1 from Day 0 to Day 14 of -1.2% in the placebo group and 9.1% in the 75 mg AZLI BID 
group. In the total paediatric population, 4 subjects had baseline FEV 1 < 75% predicted and 23 
subjects had baseline FEV1 ≥ 75% predicted. 
At Day 14, the mean difference between AZLI and placebo in change in log10 PA CFU/g was -1.6 (CI; -
2.4, -0.7; p = 0.0005) for the 75 mg AZLI BID group. 
However, as this study was not conducted with the final dose of 75mg TID this study does not 
contribute to the evaluation the efficacy of the approved 75 mg AZLI TID dosage for Cayston.   
Study CP-AI-005 
In study CP-AI-005, 211 subjects completed the 28-day TNS run-in period and were treated with 
75 mg AZLI BID, 75 mg AZLI TID, or placebo. Study CP-AI-005 enrolled 46 (21.8%) paediatric 
patients (10 [4.7%] aged 6 to 12 years, 36 [17.1%] aged 13 to 17 years). Overall, 12 paediatric 
patients were treated with placebo (1 aged 6 to 12 years, 11 aged 13 to 17 years), 17 were treated 
with 75 mg AZLI BID (4 aged 6 to 12 years, 13 aged 13 to 17 years), and 17 were treated with 75 mg 
AZLI TID (5 aged 6 to 12 years, 12 aged 13 to 17 years). 
The primary endpoint was time to need for IV or inhaled anti-PA antibiotics other than trial drug with 
documented symptom(s) predictive of pulmonary exacerbation (such as decreased exercise tolerance, 
increased cough, increased sputum/chest congestion, decreased appetite) following start of blinded 
study drug. If the patient needed inhaled or IV antibiotics for at least one of the reasons above, he/she 
was withdrawn from the trial. If at least one of thee four symptoms was present, he/she was 
considered an event patient for the primary analysis. 
There were only 10 subjects between the ages of 6 and 12 years in Study CP-AI-005, so analyses of 
treatments within this youngest subgroup were not feasible. The proportion of subjects under 18 years 
of age who required inhaled or IV antibiotics was lower than that of subjects aged 18 years or older. In 
both age subgroups, the proportion of subjects in the pooled AZLI group who required inhaled or IV 
antibiotics was lower than that of subjects in the pooled placebo group (<18 years of age: 9/34 [26%] 
pooled AZLI vs. 5/12 [42%] pooled placebo;  18 years of age: 34/101 [34%] pooled AZLI vs. 33/64

[52%] pooled placebo). Among those subjects 18 years of age or older, the time to need for inhaled or 
IV antibiotics was prolonged for the pooled AZLI treatment group compared to the pooled placebo 
group, and this difference was statistically significant (p = 0.0207). In the subgroup of subjects 
< 18 years of age, the difference was not statistically significant, but was of a similar magnitude to 
that seen in subjects 18 years of age or older. 
Comment: 
In the double blind, placebo controlled study CP-AI-005, 211 subjects completing a 28-day TNS run-
in period were randomised to 75 mg AZLI BID, 75 mg AZLI TID, or placebo. The primary endpoint 
was time to need for intravenous or inhaled antipseudomonal antibiotics. Secondary endpoints were 
e.g. FEV 1% and CFQ-R.  This study enrolled 46 (21.8%) paediatric patients (10 [4.7%] aged 6 to 12 
years, 36 [17.1%] aged 13 to 17 years). Overall, 17 were treated with selected dose of 75 mg AZLI 
TID (5 aged 6 to 12 years, 12 aged 13 to 17 years). 
In the original MAA, data per subgroup was provided.  
In both age subgroups, the proportion of subjects in the pooled AZLI group who required inhaled or IV 
antibiotics was lower than that of subjects in the pooled placebo group. In patients <18 years of age 
this was 9/34 [26%] for the pooled AZLI vs. 5/12 [42%] in the placebo group. In the subgroup of 
subjects <18 years of age, there was no significant difference in time to need for inhaled or IV 
antibiotics between pooled AZLI and placebo, a similar trend was observed as seen in subjects 18 
years of age or older. This might be due to less compromised lung function or better physical condition 
of paediatric patients. 
Study CP-AI-007 
In study CP-AI-007, overall 164 subjects were treated with 75 mg AZLI TID or placebo. In this 
study 37 (22.5%) paediatric patients (15 [9.1%] aged 6 to 12 years, 22 [13.4%] aged 13 to 17 years) 
were enrolled. Overall, 16 paediatric patients were treated with placebo (4 aged 6 to 12 years, 12 aged 
13 to 17 years) and 21 were treated with 75 mg AZLI TID (11 aged 6 to 12 years, 10 aged 13 to 17 
years). 
The primary endpoint was change from Day 0 (baseline) to Day 28 in clinical symptoms as assessed by 
the respiratory domain of the CFQ R. The CFQ-R was administered at Days 0, 14, 28, and 42/Early 
Termination in a similar fashion as in study CP-AI-005. 
Efficacy subgroup analyses by age group were conducted for FEV1 and CFQ-R RSS. Although 
statistically significant improvement in children was not demonstrated due to the small sample size, 
robust clinical significance was observed and the magnitude of improvement among children was 
greater than that seen among adults. Data are presented for 3 age groups, 6 to 12 years, 13 to 17 
years, and ≥ 18 years, in Table 4.

Comment:  
Study CP-AI-007 was a placebo controlled double blind trial. This study was already discussed during 
the initial Marketing Authorisation Application. The study included in total 164 subjects of which 16 
paediatric patients were treated with placebo (4 aged 6 to 12 years, 12 aged 13 to 17 years) and 21 
were treated with 75 mg AZLI TID (11 aged 6 to 12 years, 10 aged 13 to 17 years).  
In the overall population the adjusted mean percent change in FEV1 from baseline at Day 28 
(adjusted for disease status and baseline value) was 7.9% for AZLI-treated subjects and -2.4% for 
placebo-treated subjects versus placebo. The treatment difference of 10.3% reflected a clinically 
significant improvement in pulmonary function. The percent of subjects who used any antipseudomonal 
antibiotics was higher in the placebo group (36%) compared with the AZLI group (18%), and this 
difference was statistically significant. Also there was a trend towards more subjects being hospitalized 
from Day 0 to 42 in the placebo group than in the AZLI group: 4 subjects (5.0%) were hospitalized in 
the AZLI group compared with 12 subjects (14%) in the placebo group. In addition to fewer 
hospitalizations, the mean number of hospitalization days was lower for subjects in the AZLI group 
than in the placebo group 
In the paediatric subpopulation there is lack in power to detect significant differences due to the 
small numbers. However with respect to FEV1
 and CFQ-R RSS a similar trend is observed as in adults.  
It is noted that in table 4 in the subheading “CFQ-R RSS” the numbers of patients in the column 
“adults” report different patient number compared to the subheading “FEV ”.

Integrated Studies CP-AI-007 and CP-AI-005 
Subgroup analyses of the efficacy endpoints (FEV1 and CFQ-R RSS) were conducted for subjects aged 
6 to 12 years, 13 to 17 years, < 18 years and  18 years in a pooled analysis of the Phase 3 placebo-
controlled registration studies (Table 3). Despite robust clinical significance, where the magnitude of 
improvement was greater than that seen in adults, the small number of paediatric patients precluded 
the ability to demonstrate statistically significant improvement in children (aged 6-12 years); however, 
statistically significant improvements were demonstrated for FEV 1 and CFQ-R RSS in the adolescent 
subgroup (table 5). 
There was a significant treatment difference for change in log10 PA CFU/g sputum between the AZLI 
TID and placebo groups only for adult subjects ( 18 years old) following a 28-day treatment course 
Assessment report  
EMA/571864/2012

(treatment difference: -0.795, p = 0.0001); change in log10 PA CFU/g approached significance for 
paediatric patients < 18 years old (treatment difference: -1.213, p = 0.0824); treatment differen
ces in 
the paediatric patients 6 to 12 and 13 to 17 were -2.173 and -0.824, respectively. Although the 
treatment differences did not reach statistical significance for younger subjects (< 18 years), AZLI-
treated subjects in these subgroups demonstrated greater CFU reductions than adults ( 18 years). 
This apparent discrepancy may be due to the small number of paediatric patients and/or the decrease 
in sputum PA density observed among placebo-treated subjects < 18 years old whic
h is in contrast to 
the increase in sputum PA density observed among adult placebo-treated subjects.

In order to increase power to detect any significance the MAH pooled the paediatric patients from bot

studies CP-AI-005 and CP-AI-007. It should be noted that in study CP-AI-005 4 subjects (aged 6-12 
years; 4/20=20%) and 13 subjects (13-17 years; 13/35=37.1%) received 75 mg AZLI BID treatment
. 
These BID-treated patients were included as well in the pooled dataset. Moreover in study CP-AI-005 
patients received a 28 day run-in treatment with TNS, whilst in study CP-AI-007 patients did not. To 
support the final dose recommendation of 75 mg TID only data of children with this dosing scheme is
of interest. However, further breakdown of this population to even smaller subgroups will not reve
al 
any meaningful results because of lack of power. Generally it is questionable whether any further 
placebo controlled data will add relevant information, since a 
differential effect on FEV1 by suppression 
of chronic infection of Pseudomonas most likely will appear.  
It appears that in the paediatric subpopulations a similar trend in FEV1 and CFQ-R is observed as seen 
in the adult population, which appears to be more pronounced in the 13-17 year old subjects. Ho
wever 
this result
 might be overestimated as these studies included both the BID and TID treated AZLI 
patients.

Study GS-US-205-0117 
In Study GS-US-205-0117, 157 subjects were treated with 75 mg AZLI TID or placebo. This study 
enrolled 
89 (56.7%) paediatric patients (47 [29.9%] aged 6 to 13 years, 42 [26.8%] aged 14 to 17 
years). 
This study enrolled subjects with CF and chronic PA infection at high risk for disease progression, whi
ch 
included those with moderate to severe lung function impairment and limited treatment options and 
those who had completed participation in Study CP AI 006. Study GS-US-205-0117 did not meet its 
primary endpoint of change in CFQ-R RSS at Day 28 from Day 0. In the overall study population, 
AZLI-treated subjects did not demonstrate clin
ically significant improvement in CFQ-R RSS, although 
there was an overall improvement in scores.  
No statistically significant differences in respiratory symptoms (as measured by the CFQ-R RSS) were 
observed between treatment groups for paediatric or adult subjects. There was a greater improvemen
t 
in the CFQ-R RSS for adults (≥ 18 years) than for paediatric patients (< 18 years). At Day 28, adult 
subjects (aged ≥ 18 years; n = 68: 34 AZLI and 34 placebo) showed an adjusted mean change of 5.11 
on AZLI compared with 0.44 on placebo for the CFQ-R RSS scores (treatment effect: 4.67; p = 0.183)
. 
The adjusted mean change for younger subjects (aged < 18 years; n = 87: 41
 AZLI and 46 placebo) 
was 1.54 on AZLI and 1.77 on placebo (treatment effect: -0.23; p
 = 0.
942). 
Among children (aged 6 to 13 years), adjusted mean change (log10 CFU/g) at Day 28 was -0.29 on 
AZLI compared with 0.46 on placebo (treatment effect: -0.76; p = 0.556), and among adolescents 
(aged 14 to 17 years), adjusted mean change at Day 28 was -2.05 on AZLI compared with -0.01 on
placebo (treatment effect: -2.03; p = 0.082). In adults no significance could be shown, although a 
treatment effect was present (-0.9
2; p=0.125). The smaller sample size in each subgroup may explain 
the lack o

tical significance.

Comment:  
In double blind, placebo controlled study GS-US-205-0117, 157 subjects were treated with 75 mg AZLI 
TID or placebo. This study enrolled 89 (56.7%) paediatric patients (47 [29.9%] aged 6 to 13 years, 42 
[26.8%] aged 14 to 17 years). NOTE: Inclusion criteria >75% FEV 1, which is different compared to 
the other studies (FEV 1 ≥25% ≤75%) 
Study GS-US-205-0117 was already assessed within the context of Specific Obligation SO2 (AR dated 
February 2010). The primary objective of Study GS-US-205-0117 was to assess the safety and efficacy 
of a 28 day course of AZLI in patients with CF, mild lung disease (forced expiratory volume in 1 second 
[FEV1] > 75% predicted), and chronic PA infection of the lung. This population is significantly different 
from the populations in the other controlled trials. The modest effect seen with AZLI in this study is 
most probably due to the high baseline value of FEV1 % predicted (95.1%). Lung function is 
considered normal by the CF Foundation if FEV1 > 90% p
redicted.  
This study did not meet its primary endpoint of change in CFQ-R RSS at Day 28 from Day 0 in the 
overall population. Also in the paediatric subpopulation, AZLI-treated subjects did not demonstrate 
clinically significant improvement in CFQ-R RSS as well. Data on FEV 1 % was not provide for paediatric 
patients. It must be borne in mind that the usefulness of CFQ-R as a primary endpoint in confirmatory 
clinical trials is not sufficiently validated as discussed in earlier assessments of the original 
registrational studies for Cayston. 
Although the reduction in Log10 PA CFU/g sputum for AZLI- versus placebo-treated subjects was 
statistically significant for the overall population (treatment difference: -1.21, p = 0.016), in the 
paediatric subpopulations (6-12 years and 13-17 years) and the adult population (≥18 years), 
however, this was not achieved.

Study CP-AI-006 was an open-label follow-on study to CP-AI-005 and CP-AI-007 evaluating the safety 
of repeated exposure to Cayston and the effect on disease-related endpoints over nine 28-day 
courses.  Patients received Cayston at the same frequency (2 or 3 times a day) as they took Cayston 
or placebo in the randomised studies.  Patients continued on their baseline medications and 
whenever indicated, additional antibiotics were used in the majority of patients to treat 
exacerbations.  Each 28-day course of Cayston was followed by a 28-day off drug period. In Study 
CP-AI-006, patients were allowed to be treated as needed with any antipseudomonal antibiotics other 
than IV aztreonam therapy.  
Study CP-AI-006 was designed to assess the long term safety of AZLI (over 9 courses of treatment), 
with primary endpoints being adverse events, airway reactivity, vital signs and laboratory analyses. 
Study CP-AI-006 enrolled 274 subjects, 85 on AZLI BID and 189 on AZLI TID. Study CP-AI-006 
enrolled 55 (20.1%) paediatric patients (18 [6.6%] aged 6 to 12 years, 37 [13.5%] aged 13 to 17 
years). Overall, 19 were treated with 75 mg AZLI BID (4 aged 6 to 12 years, 15 aged 13 to 17 years) 
and 36 were treated with 75 mg AZLI TID (14 aged 6 to 12 years, 22 aged 13 to 17 years).

For subjects <18 years of age who received 75 mg AZLI TID, the mean percent change in FEV1 of 
predicted was positive at the end of every on-treatment interval and negative at the end of every off-
treatment interval (with the exception of the end of Treatment Course 7 [Visit 13] and the start of 
Treatment Courses 3 and 8, respectively). Overall, the mean percent change from baseline in FEV1 
percent of predicted at the end of each on-treatment interval was greater in subjects ≥18 years of age 
than subjects <18 years of age. 
Decreases from baseline in log10 PA CFU/g sputum were observed in the overall study population 
over the 9 treatment courses (28 days on treatment followed by 28 days off treatment) in both the 
AZLI BID and TID groups. The mean changes at the end of each treatment course were generally 
greater for subjects in the AZLI TID group relative to the AZLI BID group. 
Mean PA CFU changes in sputum for children treated with AZLI TID, aged 6 to 12 years old (N= 14), 
were similar in magnitude and direction to those of adults; mean decreases from baseline (-0.29 to -
1.69 log10 CFU/g) in sputum PA density following 28 days of AZLI were generally observed. Unlike the 
adult population, no changes or increases in sputum PA density were generally observed at the end of 
off AZLI periods in the AZLI TID paediatric patients aged 6 to 12 years old.  
Mean PA CFU changes in sputum for adolescents treated with AZLI TID, aged 13 to 17 years old 
(n=22), were similar in magnitude and direction to those for adults; mean decreases from baseline (-
0.13 to -0.75 log10 CFU/g) in sputum PA density following 28 days of AZLI were generally observed. 
Similar to adult subjects and indicative of continuous PA suppression, mean decreases from baseline in 
sputum PA density at the end of off AZLI periods were generally observed.

CP-AI-006 was a long-term open-label follow-on study to CP-AI-005 and CP-AI-007 evaluating the 
safety and tolerabilty of repeated exposure to Cayston and the effect on disease-related endpoints over 
multiple 28-day courses. This study was already extensively discussed in the original MAA. The 
patients from study CP-AI-007 did not have a run-in treatment. Patients received Cayston at the same 
frequency (2 or 3 times a day) as they took Cayston or placebo in the randomised studies. Patients 
continued on their baseline medications and whenever indicated additional antibiotics were used in the 
majority of patients to treat exacerbations.  Each 28-day course of Cayston was followed by a 28-day 
off drug period.

It is noticed that in the paediatric subgroup 6 to 12 years old from the end of course 8 no reduction in 
Log10 PA sputum is observed. Whereas in the subpopulation 13 to 17 years old it appears to show the 
same trend as in adults, although at course 5 to 7, it appears that AZLI treatment had no effect on the 
reduction of PA in sputum. 
This open uncontrolled follow-on study provides some insight into the long term effect, and particularly 
raises some concern with regard to the potential decrease in efficacy, especially in the youngest age 
groups. Comparative data are needed to ascertain whether this is different from other PA treatments. 
Study GS-US-205-0110 
In long term follow up study GS-US-205-0110, a subpopulation of 28 paediatric patients were treated 
with 75 mg AZLI TID (8 subjects aged 6 to 12 years; 20 subjects aged 13 to 17 years) and 31 were 
treated with TNS (5 subjects aged 6 to 12 years; 26 subjects aged 13 to 17 years) during the 
randomised phase. Demographic and baseline characteristics were generally balanced between 
treatment and age stratified groups. Statistically significant differences between treatment groups 
were noted in the CFQ-R RSS score for the  18 years subgroup. The mean baseline CFQ-R RSS score 
was higher for subjects  18 years treated with AZLI than for subjects  18 years treated with TNS.  
Subjects <18 years had higher baseline FEV1 % predicted and CFQ-R RSS score and lower log10 PA 
CFU compared to subjects  18 years (<18 years Log10 PA sputum 5.11 (sd 2.97); 18 years Log10 PA 
sputum 6.68 (sd 1.69)). Mean (SD) FEV1 % predicted for subjects < 18 years was 56.32 (14.19) 
compared to 51.15 (15.13) for subjects  18 years.  
Study GS-US-205-0110 is a long-term, double blind, active controlled, safety/efficacy study comparing 
AZLI with TNS. This study was critically discussed in the SO2 and renewal procedure R-15 with respect 
to the adult data. Main points of criticism were the lack of benefit of ALZI in CF patients who had 
received minimal pre-treatment with TNS before inclusion in the trial, the increase in resistance to 
aztreonam and disagreement on possible superiority claims based on 3 months data. 
Analysis of FEV1 % Predicted Change from Baseline at Day 28 and Across 3 Courses of Treatment  
Subjects < 18 years treated with AZLI showed improvement in lung function by Day 28 that was 
statistically non-inferior to TNS-treated subjects. The adjusted mean (SE) relative change from 
baseline in FEV 1 % predicted at Day 28 based on LOCF imputed data was 9.08 (3.37) for subjects 
treated with AZLI compared to 2.80 (3.28) for subjects treated with TNS; the treatment difference of -
6.28 was not statistically significant (95% CI: -13.8, 1.2; p-value: 0.0982). The magnitude of relative 
change in FEV1 % predicted in paediatric patients treated with AZLI was numerically greater compared 
to adult subjects treated with AZLI.

Subjects < 18 years treated with AZLI also showed improvement in lung function across 3 treatment 
courses that was greater than TNS-treated subjects, although no statistical differences were detected 
between treatment groups. The adjusted mean (SE) actual change from baseline in FEV1 % predicted 
across 3 treatment courses for this age group was 2.23 (1.73) for subjects treated with AZLI and 0.10 
(1.67) for subjects treated with TNS (treatment difference: -2.14, p-value: 0.3085). The magnitudes 
of change in paediatric patients were similar to those seen in adult subjects, but the small number of 
paediatrics limits the ability to detect statistical differences. 
Comment:  
Based on tables below it is shown that the treatment effect of AZLI versus TNS in paediatric patients 
(<18 years) follows the same trend  as in adults over 3 courses (treatment difference -2.14 versus -
2.98) in favour of AZLI over TNS. AZLI was non-inferior compared to TNS in both adults and children. 
The same effect is observed at day 28. This might be due to the small paediatric population and thus 
there is lack of power to detect any significance.

Figure 1 shows the effect of AZLI versus TNS in the overall population. The treatment effect in FEV1% 
is comparable in both adults and children, this applies to both AZLI treated as TNS treated patients. It 
is noticed that FEV1% declines in the TNS-treated patients after one on-off cycle. 
Time to Need for Antipseudomonal Antibiotics for Respiratory Events 
The time to need for IV antipseudomonal antibiotics for a respiratory event by age group is presented 
in Table 9. 
This endpoint was determined through the adjudication of events by a sponsor-independent, blinded 
review committee. There were no differences detected between AZLI and TNS-treated subjects 
< 18 years in the time to need for IV antipseudomonal antibiotic use for respiratory events. The 
median time to need for IV antibiotics for a respiratory event among these subjects was 177 days (i.e., 
~6 months) for subjects treated with AZLI and was not estimable for subjects treated with TNS. 
Kaplan Meier event rates at Day 168 for respiratory hospitalizations were estimated as 43% and 39% 
for AZLI and TNS-treated subjects, respectively. The same number of subjects < 18 years treated with 
AZLI (11) experienced respiratory events requiring IV antipseudomonal antibiotics as subjects treated 
with TNS.

The median time to first hospitalization for a respiratory event by age group is presented in table 10. 
This endpoint was determined through the adjudication of events by a sponsor-independent, blinded 
review committee. No differences were detected between AZLI and TNS-treated subjects < 18 years in 
the time to first respiratory hospitalization. The median time to first hospitalization for a respiratory 
event among subjects < 18 years was not estimable for subjects treated with AZLI or TNS. Kaplan 
Meier event rates at Day 168 were estimated as 36% and 23% for AZLI and TNS-treated subjects, 
respectively. The number of subjects < 18 years with a respiratory related hospitalization was 
comparable between treatment groups with 10 subjects treated with AZLI and 8 subjects treated with 
TNS.

Efficacy in Subjects Aged 6 to 12 Years and 13 to 17 Years  
Subgroup analyses of the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints were also conducted for 
subjects aged 6 to 12 years and 13 to 17 years (Table 11). None of the subgroup analyses reached 
statistical significance although some endpoints showed a favorable trend towards AZLI. Although time 
to need for IV antipseudomonal antibiotics suggested a benefit for AZLI there were no or only slight 
numerical differences between the group. 
There were no 6-year-old subjects reported in the pivotal studies (CP-AI-005 and CP-AI-007); and only 
one 6-year-old subject (Subject 1401-640) was enrolled in Study GS-US-205-0110 and completed 
3 courses of AZLI. The subject had improvement in lung function from baseline at all visits (Table 11).

Comment:  
Based on the subpopulation analysis it is shown that the FEV 1% improves in both paediatric 
subpopulations compared to TNS. This effect is the same as seen in adults. 
Based on the Kaplan Meier estimates at day 168 for Time to Need for IV Anti-PA Antibiotics for 
Respiratory Event (table 11), no difference was observed in the numbers of events between the AZLI 
and TNS treated paediatric patients. 6-12 years: ALZI 13% (n=2 events); TNS 40% (n=2 events). 13-
17 years: ALZI 56% (n=11 events); TNS 39% (n=11 events). However in adults, AZLI was in favour 
over TNS (36 versus 56 events; table 8). 
The Kaplan Meier event rates for Time to First Respiratory Hospitalization (table 11) suggest that AZLI- 
treated paediatric patients required more often hospitalisation. 6-12 years: ALZI 13% (n=1 event); 
TNS 0% (n=0 events). 13-17 years: ALZI 45% (n=9 events); TNS 27% (n=8 events). Interpretation 
should be done cautiously as only small numbers of paediatric patients were included. In adults, the 
number of events and the Time to first hospitalisation were significantly lower and longer, respectively, 
when ALZI was compared the TNS (22 versus 33 events) at day 168 (week 24), however these 
benefits can not be reproduced in younger patients. 
Regarding the other tertiary (Change in weight/body mass index (BMI) at Week 20; Missed 
school/work days, Days 0 to 168; Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) at Day 
28 and either Day 140 or Early Termination (ET) and Change in PA colony-forming units (CFUs) in 
sputum at the end of each on-drug cycle) the MAH did not provide data in the paediatric subgroups. 
However based on the data in the overall population which showed no significant differences in the 
aforementioned tertiary endpoints (exception is the TSQM which was considered significantly different), 
the same is expected in the paediatric subgroups.  
Within the subpopulations (6-12 and 13-17 years) no significant reduction in Log10 PA CFU/g was 
noticed. On average sputum PA in the subpopulation 6-12 years decreases in the same order of 
magnitude treatment difference 0.259 [mean (SE) for AZLI -3.487 (2.760); TNS -3.228 (2.701)]. In 
the subpopulation 13-17 years the treatment difference was -0.535 in favour of TNS [mean (SE) for

AZLI 0.053 (0.647); TNS -0.482 (0.494)].  
Supplementary information provided during this procedure 
The impact of AZLI treatment on hospitalization rates compared to CF patients receiving standard of 
care management was however further demonstrated in a case-matched controlled study utilizing data 
from the US CFF Registry.  In this study, the durability of AZLI efficacy overall and across age groups 
was evaluated by comparing hospitalization data from the subset of subjects in Study CP-AI-006 
originating from Study CP-AI-005 (AZLI group; N = 148; courses 1 to 6) to matched control data from 
the CFF Registry (control group; N = 444). The control group consisted of patients from the 2006 CFF 
Registry who met eligibility requirements for the CP-AI-005 trial, namely, that they had been 
prescribed TNS as a chronic therapy for ≥ 3 courses over the past 12 months. This group was matched 
against the AZLI group based on age, gender, baseline FEV1 % predicted, baseline visit quarter (to 
account for seasonality), geographic region, concomitant medications (azithromycin, pancreatic 
enzymes), and the presence or absence of CF-related diabetes. Patients in the control group were 
matched in a 3:1 ratio to subjects in the AZLI group having 1-year follow-up at the time of the 
analysis. 
Table 13 presents a comparison of hospitalizations over a 12-month period for the CP-AI-005 subset of 
Study CP-AI-006 (AZLI group) and the CFF Registry control group. The percent of patients hospitalized 
at least once was higher in the control group (54.7%) compared to the AZLI group (36.5%). These 
differences were more pronounced in the subgroups of subjects aged < 18 years. The mean number of 
hospitalization days was also lower overall for the AZLI group (6.8 days versus 11.3 days) and again, 
even greater differences were observed in the < 18 year old subgroups. Hospitalization rates 
(hospitalizations/patient-year) for subjects aged < 18 years were 0.96 for the AZLI group vs. 1.80 for 
the control group.

Study EA-US-205-0111 
Although Study EA-US-205-0111 was not included in the agreed AZLI Paediatric Investigation Plan, the 
results are used as supportive data in this Type II Variation to expand the indication to paediatric 
patients. 
Study EA-US-205-0111 was an open-label, expanded access program for subjects ≥6 years of age with 
CF and chronic PA infection that were at high risk for disease progression. 
The primary objective of this programme was to provide expanded access to AZLI 75 mg TID prior to 
its commercial availability to patients in the US with CF and chronic PA airway infection who had 
limited treatment options and were at risk for disease progression. This was an open-label programme 
with no formal hypothesis testing planned. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were collected and data 
were summarized descriptively. 
Subjects with CF and chronic PA cultured from either sputum or throat swab and limited treatment 
options were eligible in the following cohorts: 
1.  Those who were waitlisted or eligible for lung transplant based on forced expiratory volume in 1 
second (FEV1) criteria, or completed participation in the open-label trial CP-AI-006; subjects who 
had a level of lung function impairment consistent with lung transplantation criteria, but who were 
ineligible for transplantation for other reasons, could enrol in this program. 
2.  FEV 1 ≤ 40% predicted; 
3.  FEV 1 ≤ 50% predicted 
Subjects who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria could receive AZLI 75 mg TID in 56-day cycles of 
therapy (28 days on AZLI followed by 28 days off) until 1 of the following events occurred: voluntary 
withdrawal from study, the investigator requested withdrawal for subject benefit, death, new drug 
application (NDA) approval by the FDA, or study termination by Gilead.  EA-US-205-0111 had no limit 
on the number of patients who could participate and the study is now complete.

EA-US-205-0111 was thus a compassionate-use programme in which no efficacy data were collected. 
The safety results are discussed in the clinical safety section. 
Discussion 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
During the initial MAA, the indication in adults was granted based on two short term placebo controlled 
studies (CP-AI-005 and CP-AI-007) and an open-label long term study (CP-AI-006). During that time 
only data on 83 paediatric patients was available. As long term data from the pivotal study were 
lacking and taking into account the small numbers of paediatric patients, the indication granted 
referred to “short term treatment in adults only”. Long term data from the pivotal study GS-US-205-
0110 became available after granting the MAA. Furthermore additional safety data has become 
available (GS-US-205-0111, and GS-US-205-0117). 
Based on the presented data on paediatric patients (aged 6-17 years), it is concluded that still only 
small numbers of paediatric patients were included in the clinical studies and no studies focused on 
paediatric patients only.  Of the 681 patients enrolled in these trials, only 179 comprised unique 
paediatric patients. From these 179 paediatric patients only 59 were enrolled in the double blind, 
active comparator controlled study GS-US-205-0110.  
Based on the paediatric data from all efficacy studies, a similar trend is observed as in the adult 
population, although results in the paediatric populations generally did not reach statistical 
significance. FEV 1 percentage predicted and the change in log10 PA CFU/g were better in the AZLI 
treated group compared to placebo (pooled study CP-AI-005 and CP-AI-007). The same trend was 
observed in study CP-AI-006, although the value of the latter study can be questioned, due to factors 
such as open-label design, heterogenicity of the included patients and use of co-medication. 
In study GS-US-205-0117 the log10 PA CFU/g sputum significantly decreased at day 28 for the 
Assessment report

Page 32/80
 
 
 
 
 
 
overall AZLI treated population (paediatric patients and adults) compared to placebo.  
The pivotal comparative study GS-US-205-0110 showed that patients <18 years (n=28) treated with 
AZLI TID showed improvement in FEV1 % predicted both at day 28 and after 3 treatment courses 
compared to TNS treated patients (treatment difference -6.26, -2.14, respectively). The improvement 
in FEV 1 followed the same trend as in adults. 
For time to Need for IV Anti-PA Antibiotics for Respiratory Event and Time to first respiratory 
hospitalisation, no difference in the events between the AZLI and TNS treated paediatric patients was 
observed.  
The MAH further provided supplementary data from 30 paediatric subjects as a subset from another 
study that compared hospitalization rates with an external data source to refute the findings from 
study GS-US-205-0110. The presented open label study CP-IA-006 was a comparison of BID and TID 
during different periods of follow up, which might give an indication of the eventual translation of FEV1 
changes into the reduction of need of additional treatment/hospitalisation, but the study was not 
designed for these purposes. Furthermore, the comparison with data from CF patients included in other 
(non-study) settings with different treatment modalities might also be illustrative, but cannot be used 
to support or deny any claim of reduced rates of hospitalization in this age group compared to 
standard of care (i.e. TNS). 
Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
In general, the interpretation of the results from all subgroup analyses should be done cautiously as 
only small numbers of paediatric patients were included in the different trials and inclusion criteria and 
co-medication were different.

For the integrated Phase 2/3 placebo-controlled studies (CP-AI-003, CP-AI-005, and CP-AI-007), the 
incidence of many respiratory AEs and ADRs was higher among adult subjects (≥ 18 years of age), 
consistent with the general observation of increased disease severity in adult patients with CF (Table 
15).

Those preferred terms considered ADRs are presented in italicized text. ADRs were those events reported in more than 5% of 
subjects treated with AZLI TID in the placebo-controlled Phase 3 trials. 
Bronchospasm in clinical trials of AZLI was defined as a reduction of 15% or more in FEV 1 immediately following administration 
of study medication after pretreatment with a bronchodilator. 
Some AEs were observed in a higher overall proportion of paediatric patients treated with AZLI. Of 
particular interest were the AEs that were previously identified as possible ADRs to AZLI. Among these 
ADRs, higher percentages were observed in children (compared to adults) for certain events, namely 
cough (59.2% of paediatric patients vs. 48.8% of adults), pyrexia (18.4% vs. 8.5%), 
pharyngolaryngeal pain (15.8% vs. 10.8%), nasal congestion (18.4% vs. 14.1%), and rhinorrhoea 
(14.5% vs. 6.1%). 
Fever is a common symptom among patients with CF, as evidenced by the TOBI registration trials in 
which fever was reported in 44% of placebo-treated subjects (TOBI Package Insert).  In studies with 
AZLI, pyrexia occurred in similar proportions of adult subjects in the pooled AZLI (9%) and placebo 
(7%) groups. However, among AZLI-treated subjects < 18 years of age, the incidence of pyrexia was 
16% for adolescents (13 to 17 years of age) and 25% for children (6 to 12 years of age), but no AEs of 
pyrexia were reported for subjects treated with placebo < 18 years of age. One interpretation of these 
observations is that AEs of pyrexia may be a response to endotoxin release from bacterial killing and 
that children are more likely to exhibit a febrile response than adults, who may have developed 
endotoxin tolerance (West, Michael A, Heagy, Wyrta Endotoxin tolerance: A review; Critical Care 
Medicine, Volume 30, Issue 1 [January 2002], SS64-S73).

Comment: 
Based on table presented above no extra AEs or ADRs are observed in study CP-AI-003, CP-AI-005 
and CP-AI-007. “Haemoptysis” frequency within the paediatric and adult population appears to be 
similar compared to the corresponding placebo group (table 15). Although “pyrexia” shows similar 
frequencies in the adult population, in paediatric patients pyrexia shows higher frequencies (6-12 
years: 25% (n=5) and 13-17 years: 16.1%, n=9). 
Study GS-US-205-0117 
This study enrolled subjects with CF and chronic PA infection at high risk for disease progression, which 
included those with moderate to severe lung function impairment and limited treatment options and 
those who had completed participation in Study CP AI 006. 
The most commonly reported treatment-emergent AE in this study was cough, which occurred in 
35 (46%) AZLI-treated subjects and 31 (38%) placebo-treated subjects. Productive cough was the 
next most common AE (18 [23.7%] AZLI-treated subjects and 3 [16.0%] placebo-treated subjects), 
followed by nasal congestion (13 [17.1%] AZLI-treated subjects and 15 [18.5%] placebo-treated 
subjects). A greater percentage of AZLI-treated subjects reported treatment-related AEs (13 [17.1%]) 
compared to placebo-treated subjects (7 [8.6%]) (p = 0.151). Related cough was reported by 7 
(9.2%) AZLI-treated subjects and 4 (4.9%) placebo-treated subjects. An equal number of subjects in 
each treatment group reported related productive cough, 3 (3.9%) AZLI-treated subjects and 3 (3.7%) 
placebo-treated subjects. Pyrexia was reported for 8 (9.9%) placebo-treated subjects and 6 (7.9%) 
AZLI-treated subjects. All incidences of pyrexia were considered unlikely to be related to study drug. 
None of the differences in AEs were statistically significant between the AZLI and placebo groups.

The AEs of cough and pulmonary function test decreased were observed at a higher frequency in 
paediatric patients compared to adults; however, these events occurred at a similar frequency between 
AZLI- and placebo-treated paediatric patients. Pyrexia occurred at similar rates between placebo- and 
AZLI-treated subjects and no age-related differences were observed.  
Comment: 
The reported AEs from study GS-US-205-0117 do not raise any concern as AEs reported for AZLI are 
comparable to the frequency reported in the placebo group. AZLI related AEs are comparable between 
adults and the paediatric patients. Pyrexia was observed in both the paediatric and adult population in 
equal frequencies.  
Interestingly enough, although only small numbers are reported, both in placebo and in AZLI, similar 
frequencies of “Pulmonary Function Test Decreased” are observed. 
Haemoptysis is not listed in table 16. As haemoptysis was observed in the other studies, the MAH was 
requested to submit the data on haemoptysis in children, if available.

Supplementary information provided during this procedure 
A total of 3 subjects reported haemoptysis during Study GS-US-205-0117, only 1 of whom was treated 
with AZLI (Table 17). The remaining two reports of haemoptysis occurred in placebo-treated subjects 
and are not discussed further.

The AZLI-treated subject was a 17-year-old female with a medical history that included hemoptysis 
prior to study enrollment, bronchiectasis, Staphylococcus aureus, and multiple hospitalizations for CF 
exacerbations. The subject experienced 2 episodes of haemoptysis that were non-serious and mild. 
One episode occurred during the on-treatment cycle of AZLI therapy; no action was taken with AZLI 
and the subject recovered while AZLI therapy continued unchanged. The other episode occurred during 
the off-treatment cycle. Neither episode of haemoptysis was associated with bronchospasm. The 
investigator assessed both episodes of haemoptysis as not related to AZLI. 
Long term Studies 
Study CP-AI-006 
Although not a controlled study, the overall AE profile observed in Study CP-AI-006 was generally 
similar among adult and paediatric patients. Of the 274 subjects participating in Study CP-AI-006, 55 
(20%) were paediatric patients (age < 18 years) and 219 were adults (age ≥ 18 years) (80%). 
For the study as a whole, 213 of 219 (97.3%) adult subjects (≥ 18 years of age) reported at least one 
AE versus 55 of 55 (100.0%) paediatric patients (<18 years of age). Of the AEs reported with an 
incidence rate ≥ 10% in either age group, the following AEs occurred in a higher percentage (≥ 5% 
difference) of subjects <18 years of age than adult subjects: cough, pharyngolaryngeal pain, pyrexia, 
headache, rhinorrhea, crackles lung, pulmonary function test decreased, vomiting, non-cardiac chest 
pain, weight decreased, abdominal pain, abdominal pain upper, constipation, epistaxis, blood glucose 
increased, and rhonchi. In contrast the following AEs occurred in a higher percentage (≥ 5% 
difference) of adult subjects than subjects < 18 years of age: respiratory tract congestion, wheezing, 
chest discomfort, sinus congestion, diarrhea, sinus headache, back pain, dyspnea exacerbated, chills, 
and myalgia.  
Comments: 
Previously (PSUR1- assessment report dated May 2010) the CHMP concluded: Overall, safety data 
from the completed Study CP-AI-006 in which patients were treated with up to 9 courses of Cayston 
over 18 months did not reveal new safety concerns. No drug-related systemic SAEs occurred, and 
there were no meaningful haematological or chemistry findings. 
Haemoptysis was reported in both adults (≥18 years) and children (<18 years) 73/219 (33.3%) 
versus 19/55 (34.5%) respectively. 
It is noticed that in paediatric patients the AE pulmonary function test decreased (40%) which was 
Assessment report  
EMA/571864/2012

remarkably higher than in adults (18.3%). Furthermore it was also noticed that the AEs appeared 
more frequently in AZLI compared to placebo: crackles lung (34.5% vs 21.0%), vomiting (38.2% vs 
18.3%), pyrexia (54.5% vs 43.3%). The MAH should state these AEs in the SmPC.  
Study GS-US-205-0110, Randomised Phase 
Treatment-emergent AEs are presented by SOC and age in Table 18. All subjects under 18 years of 
age reported at least one AE compared to 94.4% and 96.0% of AZLI- and TNS-treated subjects  18 
years of age, respectively. The most common treatment-emergent AEs in all age groups were 
respiratory, most frequently cough and productive cough. Higher percentages of adolescents (< 18 
years of age) reported pyrexia in the AZLI- and TNS-treated groups (46.4% and 41.9%, respectively) 
than adults (27.8% and 26.7%, respectively). Also, in adolescents aged 13 to 17 years, a higher 
percentage of AZLI-treated subjects reported haemoptysis than TNS-treated subjects (21.4% [5 
subjects] vs. 3.2% [1 subject], respectively). One of the haemoptysis events resulted in hospitalization 
for an AZLI-treated subject (0602-621); the event was judged by the investigator to be severe but 
unrelated to study drug.

Comment:  
The reported AEs in study GS-US-205-0110 are in the same order of frequency between paediatric 
patients and adults. Cough and reproductive cough were most commonly reported. Pyrexia and 
haemoptysis were reported more frequently in paediatric patients treated with AZLI compared to both 
the TNS treated patients and the patients >18 years.  
Pyrexia was reported more frequently in paediatric patients (<18 years of age) both in the AZLI- and 
TNS-treated groups (46.4% and 41.9%, respectively compared to the adults (27.8% and 26.7%, 
respectively).  
In AZLI treated adolescents aged 13 to 17 years haemoptysis was reported more frequently than 
TNS-treated subjects (21.4% [5 subjects] vs. 3.2% [1 subject], respectively). Most likely, AZLI will not 
directly damage the bronchial wall resulting in haemorrhage and subsequent haemoptysis. Whether 
haemoptysis results from the induced bronchospasms due to the rapid administration of AZLI remains 
to be determined. Support for this hypothesis may be derived from decreases in lung function in AZLI-
treated paediatric patients compared to TNS. This identified safety risk is to be addressed in the RMP 
and to be mentioned in the SmPC. 
Study GS-US-205-0110, Extension Phase 
In the extension phase of Study GS-205-0110, all subjects under 13 years of age reported at least 
1 AE compared to 100% and 93.3% of AZLI/AZLI- and TNS/AZLI-treated subjects  13 to 18 years of 
age, respectively. The most common treatment-emergent AEs in both subjects under 13 years of age 
and in subjects  13 to 18 years of age were cough (57.1% and 73.9%), productive cough (42.9% and 
47.8%), and pyrexia (42.9% and 30.4%, respectively).

Comments: 
Overall the patients <18 years experienced less frequently AEs. The most common treatment-
emergent AEs in both subjects under 13 years of age and in subjects > 13 to 18 years of age were 
cough (57.1% and 73.9%), productive cough (42.9% and 47.8%), and pyrexia (42.9% and 30.4%, 
respectively). 
Summary of Adverse Event Data 
The safety results from Study GS-US-205-0110 are consistent with results from the previously 
reported Phase 2/3 clinical studies of AZLI and support the use of Cayston in patients  6 years of age 
over repeated courses of treatment. In the randomised phase of Study GS-US-205-0110, AZLI was 
well-tolerated over 3 treatment courses with an AE profile consistent with the previously established 
clinical trial experience for AZLI. Respiratory AEs were the most frequently reported treatment-
emergent AEs. A significantly higher percentage of subjects in the AZLI group reported drug-related 
AEs in comparison to subjects in the TNS group. In this unblinded study, investigators familiar with 
TNS may have attributed more AEs to a less familiar antibiotic (AZLI). In the extension phase, a 
similar percentage of subjects reported at least 1 AE in each treatment group and phase (range: 
92.6% to 97.0%). The percentages of subjects reporting respiratory AEs overall (range: 86.8% to 
93.9%) and cough (range: 69.1% to 78.8%) were similar, regardless of randomised treatment group 
and phase. In both cases the lowest percentage of subjects reporting these did so during the extension 
phase after treatment with AZLI during the randomized phase.  Similarly, productive cough and 
hemoptysis were reported by the lowest percentage of subjects (38.2% and 11.8%, respectively) 
during the extension phase after treatment with AZLI in the randomized phase. The percentage of 
subjects reporting pyrexia was highest (40%) in the extension phase among subjects who received 
TNS during the randomized phase. Percentages for pyrexia for the 3 remaining treatment and phase 
subgroups ranged from 29.4% to 31.6%. Treatment-emergent AE rates adjusted for duration on study 
were lower during the extension phase regardless of randomized treatment with the exception of 
pyrexia, diarrhea, weight decreased, and arthralgia, although the rate differences for these exceptions 
were less than 3%. 
Based on the review of the safety profile of AZLI in paediatric patients, AZLI is well-tolerated in 
paediatric patients aged 6 years and older and no new safety concerns have arisen following a review 
of the safety data from paediatric patients. In the Phase 2/3 controlled clinical registration studies of 
AZLI, the incidence of many respiratory AEs was higher among adult subjects (≥ 18 years of age) than 
paediatric patients (< 18 years of age); however, pyrexia was observed at a higher incidence rate in 
paediatric patients (18%) compared to adults (8%). The higher incidence of respiratory AEs in adults is 
consistent with the general observation of increased disease severity in adult patients with CF. In the 
randomized phase of Study GS-US-205-0110, the most common treatment-emergent AEs in paediatric 
patients were respiratory, most frequently cough and productive cough; consistent with the findings of 
previously completed AZLI studies (Studies CP-AI-003, CP-AI-005, CP-AI-006, CP-AI-007, and GS-US-
205-0117). 
Comment: 
In general the observed AEs in paediatric patients are comparable to the AEs observed in adults.  
Haemoptysis is of concern especially in children, an increase in frequency has been observed in the 
long term study GS-US-205-0110. Although the MAH explained in the SO2 that haemoptysis is not an 
ADR but related to bronchospasm, the CHMP is of the opinion that haemoptysis must be included in the 
SmPC and RMP as an identified risk. 
Assessment report  
EMA/571864/2012  
Page 40/80
 
 
 
 
 
Besides this concern on increased occurrence of haemoptysis in AZLI-treated paediatric patients, the 
CHMP agrees with the conclusion of the MAH that based on the review of the safety profile of AZLI in 
paediatric patients, AZLI is generally well-tolerated in paediatric patients aged 6 years and older and 
no new safety concerns have arisen following a review of the safety data from paediatric patients. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Short term studies 
Phase 2/3 Placebo-Controlled Studies (CP-AI-003, CP-AI-005, and CP-AI-007) 
Most SAEs that occurred during the Phase 2/3 placebo-controlled studies were attributable to 
pulmonary exacerbations. Overall a higher incidence of SAEs in paediatric patients was observed in the 
Phase 2/3 placebo-controlled studies, with the highest incidence occurring in children aged 6 to 12 
years. Serious adverse events were reported for 16% of children aged 6 to 12 years, 8% of 
adolescents, and 7% of adults. Although the number of subjects aged 12 years and younger is small, 
and must be interpreted with caution, the higher incidence of SAEs may be at least partially 
attributable to the number of hospitalizations for exacerbations that occur as children are less likely to 
be treated as outpatients when they require intravenous (IV) antibiotics. No particular patterns of 
specific SAEs were noted. 
Hospitalizations within the clinical trial setting can be considered to reflect both the safety and efficacy 
of the study drug. As anticipated for a population of patients with CF, hospitalizations for symptoms of 
CF pulmonary exacerbation accounted for the majority of SAEs in the AZLI clinical trials. For these 
analyses, hospitalization was defined as the formal admittance of a subject into a hospital for any 
medical reason for more than 1 calendar day. Table 19 summarizes hospitalizations by age group for 
the Phase 3 placebo-controlled registration studies (CP-AI-007 and CP-AI-005).

Higher proportions of AZLI-treated children (aged 6 to 12 years; n = 20) and adolescents (aged 13 to 
17 years; n = 35) were hospitalized compared with adults (20% children vs. 11% adolescents vs. 6% 
adults). However, no statistically significant differences were observed in any age subgroup for 
comparison of pooled AZLI versus pooled placebo groups in the number of subjects hospitalized, and 
the results must be interpreted with caution due to the small numbers of paediatric patients studied in 
these placebo-controlled AZLI trials. The mean number of days hospitalized was 2.1 days for children, 
0.5 days for adolescents, and 0.7 days for adults.  
Comments:  
The MAH concluded that the overall higher incidence of SAEs in paediatric patients was observed in the 
Phase 2/3 placebo-controlled studies, with the highest incidence occurring in children aged 6 to 12 
years. Serious adverse events were reported for 16% of children aged 6 to 12 years, 8% of 
adolescents, and 7% of adults. These events were reported to be related to pulmonary exercabations 
(cough, crackles lung, dyspnoea, productive cough). The SAEs were reported in both adults and 
paediatric patients in comparable frequencies.  
Higher proportions of AZLI-treated children (aged 6 to 12 years; n = 20) and adolescents (aged 13 to 
17 years; n = 35) were hospitalized compared with adults (20% children vs. 11% adolescents vs. 6% 
adults). However, no statistically significant differences were observed in any age subgroup for 
comparison of pooled AZLI versus pooled placebo groups in the number of subjects hospitalized. This 
may be attributed to the small number of subjects. 
Study GS-US-205-0117 
Overall, 12 subjects experienced a total of 20 treatment-emergent SAEs. Serious adverse events were 
associated with hospitalizations in all cases. Twelve subjects experienced 14 hospitalizations in total. At 
the time of the SAEs, no subject was 6 to 12 years of age, 7 subjects were 13 to 17 years of age, and 
5 subjects were ≥ 18 years of age. In the AZLI group, 9 (11.8%) subjects reported SAEs compared 
with 3 (3.7%) subjects in the placebo group (p = 0.073). The most frequently reported SAEs occurred 
in the respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders SOC, with 6 (7.9%) subjects in the AZLI group 
reporting SAEs in this SOC compared with 2 (2.5%) subjects in the placebo group, with the most 
common SAE overall being cough. Three (3.9%) subjects in the AZLI group reported an SAE of cough 
compared with 1 (1.2%) subject in the placebo group. None of the SAEs were considered by the 
investigators to be related to study drug. 
Long term studies 
Study CP-AI-006 
A higher incidence of SAEs in paediatric patients was also noted in Study CP-AI-006 as a whole; 
however, the overall AE profile was otherwise generally similar among adult and paediatric patients. 
Overall, SAEs were reported for 56% of children aged 6 to 12 years, 51% of adolescents, and 38% of 
adults. Most SAEs were attributable to hospitalization for symptoms of pulmonary exacerbation. Of the 
SAEs occurring in ≥ 3% of subjects in any age subgroup, most events were reported at a higher 
incidence in paediatric patients. Within the paediatric subgroup, comparisons of the overall subgroups 
of children (aged 6 to 12 years; n = 18) and adolescents (aged 13 to 17 years; n = 37) generally 
showed a higher incidence of some SAEs among children, but these observations must be interpreted 
with caution because the number of subjects in each subgroup is small. 
Of the subjects <18 years of age, 65.5% were hospitalized at least once compared with 45.7% of 
subjects ≥18 years of age. The overall hospitalization rates per subject year were 1.299 and 0.830 for 
Assessment report

subjects <18 years of age and subjects ≥18 years of age, respectively. In both age groups, the cause 
of hospitalization was primarily lower respiratory tract symptoms with hospitalization rates for 
respiratory events at 1.219 and 0.775 for subjects <18 years of age and subjects ≥18 years of age, 
respectively. As stated above, the higher incidence of hospitalizations in paediatric patients in the AZLI 
trials may reflect the subjects’ relatively severe underlying CF disease, the prevailing standard of care 
in which paediatric patients are more likely to be hospitalized compared to adults, and parental 
concerns. 
Based on the long-term data from Study CP-AI-006, the repeated use of AZLI over nine 28-day 
intermittent treatment courses (18 months) is well-tolerated for adult and paediatric patients aged 6 
years and older. 
Comment: 
The higher incidence of hospitalisation in paediatric patients can be attributed to the severity of CF in 
children and the prevailing standard of care. Data on admission due to haemoptysis should be 
provided.  
With respect to the safety no additional concerns are raised based on study CP-AI-006. 
Study GS-US-205-0110, Randomised Phase 
In subjects < 18 years, a greater percentage of subjects reported SAEs in the AZLI treated group (12 
[42.9%]), than in the TNS treated group (8 [25.8%]). In subjects 13 to 17 years, a greater 
percentage of subjects reported SAEs in the AZLI treated group (10 [50.0%]), than in the TNS treated 
group (8 [30.8%]). In subjects 6 to 12 years, a greater percentage of subjects reported SAEs in the 
AZLI treated group (2 [25.0%]), than in the TNS treated group (0). Among subjects ≥ 18 years, a 
lower percentage of subjects reported treatment-emergent SAEs in the AZLI treated group (30 
[27.8%]), than in the TNS treated group (36 [35.6%]). 
Among subjects < 18 years of age, cough was reported by 8 subjects (28.6%) treated with AZLI and 5 
subjects (16.1%) treated with TNS.  Cough was reported among subjects ≥ 18 years of age by a 
similar percentage of subjects treated with AZLI (19 [17.6%]) and TNS (21 [20.8%]). 
Productive cough was reported among subjects ≥ 18 years of age by a lower percentage of subjects 
treated with AZLI (12 [11.1%]) compared to subjects treated with TNS (18 [17.8%]). Similar 
percentages of subjects in each treatment group reported productive cough among subjects < 18 
years of age (AZLI: 4 [14.3%], TNS: 5 [16.1%]), subjects 13 to 17 years of age (AZLI: 4 [20.0%], 
TNS: 5 [19.2%]), and subjects 6 to 12 years of age  
(AZLI: 0, TNS: 0). 
Dyspnea was reported among subjects ≥ 18 years of age by a lower percentage of subjects treated 
with AZLI (8 [7.4%]) compared to subjects treated with TNS (12 [11.9%]). Similar percentages of 
subjects in each treatment group reported dyspnea among subjects < 18 years of age (AZLI: 2 
[7.1%], TNS: 3 [9.7%]), subjects 13 to 17 years of age (AZLI: 2 [10.0%], TNS: 3 [11.5%] and 
subjects 6 to 12 years of age (AZLI: 0, TNS: 0). 
Among subjects ≥ 18 years of age, pyrexia was reported by a similar percentage of subjects treated 
with AZLI (8 [7.4%]) and TNS (8 [7.9%]).  Among subjects < 18 years of age, pyrexia was reported 
by a greater percentage of subjects treated with AZLI (3 [10.7%]) than subjects treated with TNS (0). 
Of the 3 subjects < 18 years of age who reported pyrexia, all 3 were 13 to 17 years of age.

Comment: 
Pyrexia was reported by a similar percentage of subjects treated with AZLI (8 [7.4%]) and TNS (8 
[7.9%]).  Among subjects <18 years of age, pyrexia was reported by a greater percentage of subjects 
treated with AZLI (3 [10.7%]) than subjects treated with TNS (0%). 
Study GS-US-205-0110, Extension Phase 
In the extension phase of Study GS-205-0110, 1 AZLI/AZLI-treated subject (25.0%) and 1 TNS/AZLI-
treated subject (33.3%) under 13 years of age reported at least 1 SAE compared to 1 AZLI/AZLI-
treated (12.5%) subject and 4 TNS/AZLI-treated subjects (26.7%)  13 to 18 years of age, 
respectively. The most common treatment-emergent SAEs in subjects under 18 years of age were 
productive cough (1 TNS/AZLI-treated subject under 13 years of age; 4 TNS/AZLI-treated subjects 
 13 to 18 years of age) and cough (1 TNS/AZLI-treated subject under 13 years of age; 3 TNS/AZLI-
treated subjects  13 to 18 years of age), and decreased appetite (1 TNS/AZLI-treated subject under 
13 years of age; 1 AZLI/AZLI- and 1 TNS/AZLI-treated subject  13 to 18 years of age). 
Study EA-US-205-0111 
A total of 626 subjects were screened at 65 study sites in the US. Of the 603 treated subjects, 344 
subjects (57.0%) prematurely discontinued study treatment, primarily due to subject request. Subjects 
ranged in age from 6 to 66 years, with a mean (SD) age of 28.8 (11.68) years. Twenty-six subjects 
(4.3%) were 6 to 12 years of age and 82 subjects (13.6%) were 13 to 17 years of age. Three hundred 
fourteen subjects (52.1%) were female. Five hundred seventy-six subjects (95.5%) were white. The 
mean (SD) FEV1 % predicted at baseline was 40.37 (16.13); 494 subjects (82.4%) had baseline FEV1 
≤ 50% predicted, including 338 subjects (56.4%) with baseline FEV1 ≤ 40% predicted. 
In Study EA-US-205-0111, 108 paediatric patients received at least 1 dose of AZLI, 26 subjects aged 6 
to 12 years and 82 subjects aged 13 to 17 years. The safety data from this study are consistent with 
results from the previous Phase 2/3 studies and support the use of AZLI in CF subjects ≥ 6 years of 
age over repeated courses of treatment. 
Discontinuations due to SAEs 
A total of 37 subjects (6.1%) discontinued study drug as a result of SAEs. Lung disorder was the most 
frequent SAE leading to discontinuation (29 subjects [4.8%]). 
No subjects in the 6 to 12 year age group discontinued due to SAEs. In the 13 to 17 year age group 
and ≥18 year age group, 10 subjects (12.2%) and 27 subjects (5.5%) discontinued due to SAEs, 
respectively, predominantly due to lung disorder (9 subjects [11.0%] and 20 subjects [4.0%], 
respectively). 
The 3 subjects (0.5%) who experienced 1 drug-related SAE each during the study also withdrew from 
the study.  Reasons for withdrawal associated with these SAEs (spontaneous abortion, lung disorder, 
and haemoptysis) were recorded as pregnancy, death, and haemoptysis, respectively.

Hospitalizations 
A total of 358 subjects (59.4%) experienced 1016 hospitalizations (both treatment-emergent and 
nontreatment-emergent). In the < 18 year age group, 87 subjects (80.6%) were hospitalized 
compared to 271 subjects (54.7%) in the ≥ 18 year age group. Overall, the hospitalization rate per 
subject year was 1.4 (1.7 for subjects 6 to 12 years of age, 2.5 for subjects 13 to 17 years of age, 2.3 
for subjects < 18 years of age, and 1.3 for subjects ≥ 18 years of age). 
Table 21: 
EA-US-205-0111: Hospitalizations by Age Group (Safety Analysis Set) 
Comment:  
EA-US-205-0111 was a compassionate-use programme in which no efficacy data were collected. 495 
adults, 26 children 6-12 years and 82 children 13-17 years were included. Although Study EA-US-205-
0111 was not included in the agreed AZLI Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP; EMEA-000827-PIP01-09), 
the results were submitted as supportive data by the MAH. 
Serious adverse events were similar across age groups with the exception of lung disorders which was 
reported with higher incidence among subjects < 18 years of age (74.1% <18 years versus 44.6% in 
adults). This may reflect the current standard of care in which pulmonary exacerbations in paediatric 
patients are more likely to be reported and treated compared to adults. 
Haemoptysis was reported in similar frequencies in children and adults (4.6% versus 5.3%). 
More children were hospitalised (80.6%) compared to adults (54.7%). Hospitalisation rate per subject 
was 2.3 for children compared to adults 1.3. 
Summary of Serious Adverse Events Data 
The SAE data from Study GS-US-205-0110 are consistent with results from the previously reported 
Phase 2/3 clinical studies of AZLI (Studies CP-AI-003, CP-AI-005, CP-AI-006, CP-AI-007, and GS-US-
205-0117) and support the use of Cayston in all patients (including paediatrics  6 years of age) over 
repeated courses of treatment. In the randomised phase, a similar percentage of subjects reported 
SAEs in the AZLI-treated and the TNS-treated groups.  In the extension phase, rates of SAEs did not 
increase with increased exposure to AZLI, and no differences in safety profiles were observed when 
subjects treated with TNS switched to AZLI.   
Most of the SAEs that have occurred in adult and paediatric patients during clinical studies of AZLI 
were attributable to pulmonary exacerbations; the most common SAE reported in both age groups was 
cough. Cayston continues to be a generally well-tolerated and effective inhaled antipseudomonal 
antibiotic therapy for both adults and children aged 6 years and older over multiple treatment courses.

Paediatric Deaths 
No paediatric patients died during Phase 2/3 clinical studies of AZLI. However, in Study EA US 205-
0111 a total of 33 subjects (5.5%) died on study (post-baseline visit), including 1 subject (3.8%) in 
the 6 to 12 year age group, 3 subjects (3.7%) in the 13 to 17 year age group, and 29 subjects in the ≥ 
18 year age group, respectively. five paediatric patients died after screening.  
All deaths were reported not to be related to AZLI.

Discontinuation due to AES 
Four patients in the placebo controlled studies [two placebo and two AZLI treated patients (1 rash, 
urticaria, dizziness and 1 headache)] discontinued because of study drug intolerance. In the open 
follow on study 2 and 5 patients in the AZLI BID and AZLI TID groups respectively discontinued 
because of study drug intolerance (mostly due to chest or lung function AE and single case of tinnitus, 
arthralgia or hemoptysis. 
Study GS-US-205-0110, Randomised Phase 
There were 9 subjects (6.6%) treated with AZLI and 1 subject (0.8%) treated with TNS who 
discontinued study drug due to AEs. Six subjects (4.4%) treated with AZLI and 1 subject (0.8%) 
treated with TNS discontinued due to respiratory AEs, most frequently productive cough and 
hemoptysis (AZLI: 3 subjects (2.2%), TNS: 0 subjects for each PT). Additional respiratory events 
experienced by the 6 AZLI-treated subjects included dyspnea (2 SAEs), oropharyngeal pain (1 AE, 1 
SAE), bronchial secretion retention (1 AE), cough (2 SAEs), rales (1 SAE), sputum discolored (1 SAE), 
and wheezing (1 SAE). The 1 TNS-treated subject who withdrew experienced fatigue, rhinorrhea, and 
oropharyngeal pain. 
The CHMP commented on the higher rates of patients reporting drug-related AEs (including severe AEs 
and discontinuations) in the AZLI group after 3 courses of treatment in their Request for 
Supplementary Information (Question 3) dated 22 December 2010 (EMA Ref. EMA/841208/2010). 
Gilead responded stating that the Data Safety Monitoring Committee had evaluated the safety data 
during the trial and did not recommend any changes and that placebo-controlled studies of AZLI are 
the most informative with regard to evaluating drug-related AEs. Full details can be found in Gilead’s 
response to the CHMP Request for Supplementary Information (Question 3) submitted on 16 March 
2011 and this question was deemed resolved in the Specific Obligation assessment report dated 17 
June 2011.

Study GS-US-205-0110, Extension Phase 
One subject (1.5%) in the AZLI/AZLI treatment group and 5 subjects (7.7%) in the TNS/AZLI 
treatment group discontinued study drug due to AEs. Three of the TNS/AZLI-treated subjects and the 1 
AZLI/AZLI-treated subject discontinued due to AEs assessed by the investigator as related to study 
drug. The AZLI/AZLI-treated subject experienced 2 events of pyrexia (mild) and 1 event of fatigue 
(mild).  Two subjects (3.1%) in the TNS/AZLI treatment group discontinued due to respiratory AEs 
(bronchial obstruction [moderate] and productive cough [severe]). The subject who experienced 
bronchial obstruction also experienced a moderate decrease in exercise tolerance (1.5%).  Two 
subjects (3.1%) in the TNS/AZLI treatment group experienced tongue disorder (mild), 1 of these 
subjects also experienced oral discomfort (mild) and the other subject also experienced mouth 
ulcerations (mild), diarrhea (mild), lip swelling (mild), dysgeusia (mild), and vaginal haemorrhage 
(mild). One subject in the TNS/AZLI treatment group experienced decreased pulmonary function test 
(severe). 
Expanded Access Programme, Protocol EA-US-205-0111 
In study EA-US-205-011 lung disorder was the most frequent SAE leading to discontinuation 
(29 subjects [4.8%]).  
Expanded Access Programme (Protocol EA-US-205-0122) 
As of 06 July 2011, 2 subjects (5.7%) have discontinued study drug as a result of SAEs (chronic 
respiratory failure and lung infection “pseudomonal” in Subject 406-12 and lung disorder in Subject 
410-02). The SAEs for both subjects were assessed by the investigator as not being related to study 
drug. 
Comment:  
Data from the overall patient population suggests that AZLI is well tolerated. Discontinuation was 
caused due to pulmonary disorders. No specific paediatric data was submitted by the MAH.

MIC 50 and MIC 90 values PA isolates, GS-US-205-0110 randomised phase 
The MIC 50 (the minimum concentration of an agent that inhibits 50% of isolates from a particular 
organism) and MIC 90 (the minimum concentration of an agent that inhibits 90% of isolates from a 
particular organism) of aztreonam for all PA isolates in the randomised phase of the study are 
presented in Table 22. The aztreonam MIC50 for all PA isolates was identical at baseline (2 g/mL) and 
remained unchanged ( 2-fold changes) in both treatment groups throughout the study. There was a 
4-fold difference at baseline in the aztreonam MIC90 for all PA isolates between the AZLI treatment 
group (32 g/mL) and the TNS (128 g/mL) treatment group. The aztreonam MIC90 remained 
unchanged ( 2-fold changes) in the TNS treatment group throughout the study. In the AZLI treatment 
group, persistent increases in the aztreonam MIC90 were observed. At the end of study (Week 24), 
however, the aztreonam MIC90 in the AZLI treatment group (128 g/mL) was within a 2-fold difference 
of the TNS treatment group (64 g/mL).

Comment:  
Of concern are the observed increases (4-fold) in the MIC 90 of aztreonam for all PA isolates 
in the AZLI treatment group, from baseline 32 μg/ml to 128 μg/ml at week 24.  In contrast MIC90 
for TNS decreased from 128 μg/ml at baseline to 64 μg/ml at week 24. 
Similarly, the increases (4-fold) in the MIC for the least susceptible PA isolate to aztreonam in the 
AZLI-treated patients are of concern.  A 4-fold increase in MIC for aztreonam in the least susceptible 
PA isolate was reported for 35% of subjects at week 24, whereas in the TNS group only 20% of 
subjects that were exposed to tobramycin demonstrated a 4-fold increase in MIC for tobramycin. 
Similar effects in the AZLI group were observed when the established parenteral resistance breakpoint 
for aztreonam (MIC >8 μg/mL) was considered in the analysis: At baseline, 39 AZLI-treated patients 
(34%) and 38 TNS-treated patients (35%) had a PA isolate with aztreonam MIC >8 μg/mL. At the end 
of the first course of treatment (Week 4), 45 AZLI-treated patients (40%) had a PA isolate with 
aztreonam MIC >8 μg/mL. Throughout the study, this percentage remained above the baseline value. 
At Week 24, 56 patients (49%) treated with AZLI had a PA isolate with aztreonam MIC > 8 μg/mL. In 
the TNS group the percentage of patients with PA isolate with aztreonam MIC > 8 μg/mL remained 
below the baseline value after the first course, ranging from 26% to 32%. 
MIC 50 and MIC 90 of Aztreonam and Tobramycin for all PA Isolates, GS-US-205-0110 overall study 
There was a ≥2-fold difference at Randomized Week 0 in the aztreonam MIC50 for all PA isolates 
between the AZLI/AZLI (2 µg/mL) and TNS/AZLI (≤1 µg/mL) treatment groups as well as a 4-fold 
difference at baseline in the aztreonam MIC90 between the AZLI/AZLI (32 µg/mL) and TNS/AZLI 
(128 µg/mL) treatment groups. During the randomised phase, the aztreonam MIC50 for all PA isolates 
remained unchanged (≤ 2-fold changes) in the AZLI/AZLI and TNS/AZLI treatment groups. During the 
extension phase, the aztreonam MIC50 for all PA isolates remained unchanged (≤ 2-fold changes) in 
the TNS/AZLI treatment group.  Three intermittent increases (4-fold changes) in the aztreonam MIC50 
were observed over the 12-month study in the AZLI/AZLI treatment group.  However, at Extension 
Week 24, the aztreonam MIC50 remained unchanged (≤ 2-fold change) from Randomised Week 0. 
During the randomised phase, the aztreonam MIC90 for all PA isolates increased (≥ 4-fold changes) 5 
times in the AZLI/AZLI treatment groups and remained unchanged (≤ 2-fold changes) in the TNS/AZLI 
treatment group.  During the extension phase, the aztreonam MIC90 for all PA isolates remained 
unchanged (≤ 2-fold changes) in the TNS/AZLI treatment group.  Frequent increases (≥4-fold 
changes) in the aztreonam MIC90 were observed in the study overall for the AZLI/AZLI treatment 
group.  However, at Extension Week 24, the aztreonam MIC90 remained unchanged (≤ 2-fold change) 
from Randomised Week 0.

GS-US-205-0110 Study Overall: MIC 90 of Aztreonam for all PA Isolates 
There was a 2-fold difference at Randomised Week 0 in the tobramycin MIC50 for all PA isolates 
between the AZLI/AZLI (1 µg/mL) and TNS/AZLI (2 µg/mL) treatment groups but no difference at 
baseline in the aztreonam MIC90 (32 µg/mL) between the AZLI/AZLI and TNS/AZLI treatment groups.  
During the randomised phase, the tobramycin MIC50 and MIC90 for all PA isolates remained unchanged 
(≤ 2-fold changes) in the AZLI/AZLI and TNS/AZLI treatment groups.  During the extension phase in 
the TNS/AZLI treatment group (when the subjects were treated with AZLI), the tobramycin MIC 50 for 
all PA isolates remained unchanged (≤ 2-fold changes) while a single 4-fold decrease in tobramycin 
MIC 90 was observed at Extension Week 4.  In the AZLI/AZLI treatment group, the tobramycin MIC50 
and MIC 90 remained unchanged for the study overall, while two 4-fold decreases in the tobramycin 
MIC 90 were observed at Extension Weeks 12 and 16.

Comment:  
The increased MIC 90 in the AZLI group remained elevated in the extension phase, whereas the initial 
MIC 90 for Aztreonam also showed a general increase without further linear progression during the 
extension phase with AZLI in subjects initially treated with TNS. 
The percentage increased MIC50 to aztreonam remained the same during the randomisation period and 
during the extension period in both groups TNS/AZLI and AZLI/AZLI. 
The increase in MIC90 in the AZLI group - as observed during the 24 weeks of the randomisation period 
- remained elevated in the extension phase in the AZLI/AZLI group.  In the TNS/AZLI group the initial 
MIC 90 for Aztreonam also showed a mild increase during the extension phase in which AZLI was 
administered to subjects initially treated with TNS. 
During the extension period the MIC90 of tobramycin remained unchanged.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
Ninety-seven percent (97.0%) of AZLI-treated subjects and 92.3% of TNS-treated subjects tested 
positive for PA at Week -2 and/or Week 0 (baseline) (Table 22).  Of the 14 subjects who tested 
negative for PA at baseline [AZLI (n=4); TNS (n=10)], all but 4 TNS-treated subjects tested positive 
for PA at one or more visits during the study.  Of the AZLI-treated subjects (n=128) and TNS-treated 
subjects (n=120) who tested positive for PA at baseline, 23 (18.0%) and 27 (22.5%) tested negative 
for PA at one or more visits during the study (Weeks 2-24). Disappearance data was not available for 
one TNS-treated subject. Study inclusion criteria were designed to guide enrolment of subjects with 
chronic PA infection.  Subjects who tested negative for PA at baseline or during the study may be more 
reflective of poor sputum sampling than true absence of the pathogen. Further, eradication of PA is not 
expected in subjects with chronic infection.

Comment:  
Based on the table above it is shown that patients treated with AZLI have a decrease in presence of PA 
from baseline (week -2) 97.0% to 91.3% in week 24. Patients treated with TNS showed a reduction in 
PA from baseline (week -2) 92.3% to 85.8% in week 24. These data demonstrate once more that in 
most CF patients chronic infection with PA cannot be eradicated by inhalation of antibiotics, but that 
bacterial load reductions of PA by suppressive antibiotic therapy may at most prevent exacerbations 
and reduce the rate of progressive decline of lung function. Considering this lack of eradication and the 
decrease in susceptibility to aztreonam in the persistent bacteria colonizing the airways, patients end 
up with resistant PA. 
Methicillin-Sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) 
Thirty-six percent (36.4%) of AZLI-treated subjects and 39.2% of TNS-treated subjects tested positive 
for MSSA at Week -2 and/or Week 0 (baseline) (table 23).  Of the 48 AZLI-treated subjects and 51 
TNS-treated subjects with MSSA present at baseline, 25 (52.1%) and 30 (58.8%), respectively, tested 
negative for MSSA at 1 or more visits during the study (Weeks 2-24). Of the 84 AZLI-treated subjects 
with a negative culture for MSSA at Week -2 and Week 0, 22 (26.2%) were culture positive at 1 or 
more visits throughout the study, while 62 (73.8%) remained culture negative throughout the study. 
Of the 79 TNS-treated subjects with a negative culture for MSSA at Week -2 and Week 0, 15 (19.0%) 
were culture positive at 1 or more visits throughout the study, while 63 (79.7%) remained culture 
negative throughout the study. Appearance data was not available for 1 TNS-treated subject.

All subjects were treated with AZLI during the extension phase of the study.  
Most subjects attended Randomized Week 24 and Extension Week 0 visits on the same day and thus have identical data values 
summarized at both visits.  
For a defined period, a pathogen was counted as being present if there was ever a positive isolation detected. Presence at multiple 
visits was counted only once.   
For a defined period, a pathogen was counted as being absent if there was never a positive isolation detected. 
n = the number of subjects with available data at each visit and was used as the denominator for the calculation of percentage. 
Comment: 
In the randomised phase of GS-US-205-0110 (Table 26) both the AZLI- and TNS-treated patient 
groups showed reductions in the presence of MSSA from baseline (week -2) till week 24. In the AZLI 
group a reduction from 36.4% to 31.7% was shown versus a reduction in the TNS group 39.2% to 
31.0%.   
In the extension phase all patients were switched on AZLI, either after AZLI pre-treatment (AZLI/AZLI) 
or after TNS pre-treatment (TNS/AZLI). In AZLI/AZLI, MSSA remained present in about one third of all 
subjects both at the end of the randomisation period of 24 weeks and after conclusion of the extension 
period of 24 weeks. However, an increase in the presence of MSSA was seen in the extension phase

(table 27) for TNS/AZLI patients (n=65) from 36.2% at week 24 of the TNS treatment period to 42.9% 
in extension period at week 24 after treatment with AZLI. 
Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) 
Seventeen percent (17.4%) of AZLI-treated subjects and 20.0% of TNS-treated subjects tested 
positive for MRSA at Week -2 and/or Week 0 (baseline) (table 28).  Of the 23 AZLI-treated subjects 
and 26 TNS-treated subjects with MRSA present at baseline, 9 (39.1%) and 13 (50.0%), respectively, 
tested negative for MRSA at 1 or more visits during the study (Week 2-24). Of the 109 AZLI-treated 
subjects with a negative culture for MRSA at Week -2 and Week 0, 13 (12%) were culture positive at 1 
or more visits throughout the study, while 96 (88.1%) remained culture negative throughout the 
study. Of the 104 TNS-treated subjects with a negative culture for MRSA at Week -2 and Week 0, 1 
(1.0%) was culture positive at 1 or more visits throughout the study, while 102 (98.1%) remained 
culture negative throughout the study. Appearance data was not available for 1 TNS-treated subject. 
The percentage of AZLI-treated subjects with a positive culture for MRSA remained relatively constant 
(16 to 20%) from Weeks 2 to 24 and similar to the baseline (Week -2/0) value (17%). The percentage 
of TNS-treated subjects with a positive culture for MRSA remained relatively constant (11 to 16%) 
from Weeks 2 to 24 but was always lower than the baseline value (20%).

Treatment-emergent Isolation of MRSA was more pronounced in AZLI treated patients compared to 
TNS (AZLI 6.8% versus TBS 0.8%). 
Comment:  
The treatment emerging isolation of MRSA was most pronounced in the AZLI group: 17% of subjects 
isolated MRSA at baseline and 20% at week 24, whereas in the TNS group the proportion dropped 
from 20% at baseline to 11% at week 24 of TNS treatment. In 12% of AZLI patients this pathogen 
appeared during the study period, whereas it was only newly isolated in 1% of the TNS-treated 
subjects. 
The isolation of MRSA in increasing numbers of AZLI patients is worrisome, because MRSA will result in 
increased disease severity (Sawicki, Pediatr Pulmonol, 2008) and is associated with decreased survival. 
The attributable risk of death associated with MRSA was 34% in the trial of Dasenbrook, JAMA, 2010. 
Temporary gains in FEV 1 while on treatment with AZLI might therefore be compromised in the near 
future by treatment-emerging MRSA, more frequent than with TNS, which is particularly worrisome 
because of the young age of these CF patients. 
A warning referring to the association between persistent isolation of MRSA and worse clinical 
outcome, as reported in the literature, is added to the Product Information. 
PA Resistance to Antibiotic Class 
GS-US-205-0110 Randomised Phase 
Subjects with MIC for PA greater than the parenteral breakpoint of amikacin, cefepime, ceftazidime, 
piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid, meropenem and ciprofloxacin for their 
PA isolate with the highest MIC at each visit are presented in the Study GS-US-205-0110 CSR.  
The 8 antibiotics listed in the paragraph above and tobramycin were grouped according to antibiotic 
class. Those subjects with MIC greater than the parenteral breakpoint of amikacin and tobramycin, 1 
or more of the beta-lactams, all 6 beta-lactams, and ciprofloxacin (PA isolate with the highest MIC at 
each visit) were identified. In addition, subjects with multi-drug resistant PA (MDRPA) are presented 
according to two definitions: 1) subjects with at least 1 PA isolate resistant to all antibiotics tested in 2 
of the 3 drug classes, and 2) subjects with at least 1 PA isolate resistant to at least 1 antibiotic tested 
in 2 of the 3 drug classes. 
At baseline (Week 0), similar percentages of subjects in the AZLI and TNS treatment groups had PA 
isolates with antibiotic resistance to beta-lactams, aminoglycosides and quinolones. The percentage of 
subjects with at least one PA isolate resistant to 1 or more beta-lactams was nearly identical between 
treatment groups (AZLI: 64 subjects [55.7%], TNS: 63 subjects [57.3%]). The percentage of subjects 
with at least 1 PA isolate resistant to tobramycin and amikacin was nearly identical between treatment 
groups (AZLI: 36 [31.3%], TNS: 32 [29.1%]). Subjects with at least 1 PA isolate resistant to 
ciprofloxacin were nearly identical between treatment groups (AZLI: 68 [59.1%]; TNS: 63 [57.3%]). 
Subjects with at least 1 PA isolate resistant to all antibiotics tested in 2 of the 3 drug classes (Cystic 
Fibrosis Foundation definition of MDRPA) were nearly identical between treatment groups (AZLI: 35 
[30.4]%; TNS: 35 [31.8%]) and subjects with at least 1 PA isolate resistant to at least 1 antibiotic 
tested in 2 of the 3 drug classes (alternate definition of MDRPA) were nearly identical between 
treatment groups (AZLI: 67 [58.3]%; TNS: 66 [60%]). 
At the end of the first treatment course (Week 4) through Week 24, the percentage of subjects with at 
Assessment report  
EMA/571864/2012

least 1 PA isolate resistant to 1 or more beta-lactams increased from the baseline value (55.7%) to 
61% to 72% and was 66.7% at Week 24. The percentage of TNS-treated subjects with at least 1 PA 
isolate resistant to 1 or more beta-lactams increased from the baseline value (57.3%) to 62.5% at the 
end of the first TNS treatment course, decreased at the end of the last treatment course to 47.8%, and 
returned to the baseline value at Week 24. At the end of the first and last AZLI courses, the 
percentage of subjects with at least 1 PA isolate resistant to all beta-lactams increased from the 
baseline value (13%) to 18% and 21%, respectively, and was 18.4% at Week 24. The percentage of 
TNS-treated subjects with at least 1 PA isolate resistant to all beta-lactams increased from the baseline 
value (17%) to 21% at the end of the first TNS treatment course but decreased at the end of the last 
treatment course to 12.3%. At the end of all 3 TNS treatment courses, the percentage of subjects with 
at least 1 PA isolate resistant to tobramycin and amikacin increased from the baseline value (29%) to 
35% to 37%. At the end of all 3 AZLI treatment courses, the percentage of subjects with at least 1 PA 
isolate resistant to tobramycin and amikacin decreased from the baseline value (31%) to 21% to 27%. 
Throughout the study, the percentage of subjects in both treatment groups with at least 1 PA isolate 
resistant to ciprofloxacin remained similar to their baseline values.  
Based on either definition of MDRPA, the percentage of subjects with MDRPA did not change 
throughout the study in either treatment group. The percentage of AZLI subjects with MDRPA ranged 
from 25% to 34% from Week 0 to 24 while the percentage of TNS-treated subjects with MDRPA 
ranged from 27% to 34%. 
In their Request for Supplementary Information (Question 4c-d), dated 22 December 2010 (EMA Ref. 
EMA/841208/2010), the CHMP commented on the changes in the susceptibility of PA to cefepime and 
piperacillin in AZLI-treated subjects during the randomised phase, as well as increases in the 
percentage of AZLI-treated subjects with parenteral resistance to all beta-lactams during the 
randomised phase of the study.  Gilead responded stating that cross-resistance to other antibiotics in 
the same class is a likely consequence of suppressive antibiotic therapy in which eradication of PA is 
unexpected, but that the data suggest that the availability of two inhaled antibiotics from different 
classes (AZLI and TNS) provides physicians with a means to better manage the development of 
resistance.  
Comment: 
Bêta lactam antibiotics, especially third generation cephalosporines, are frequently administered 
intravenously in case of pulmonary infections and especially in case of Pseudomonas infections. An 
increase in PA resistance rates to at least 1 beta lactam antibiotic during treatment was demonstrated 
in AZLI: from baseline (week 0/2) 55.7% to 66.7% in week 24, whereas in TNS this proportion 
remained the same (baseline 57.3% to 58.3% in week 24). 
Resistance to all beta lactam antibiotics in at least 1 isolate was demonstrated in 13% in the AZLI 
group at baseline which increased to 18.4% at week 24. However, in the TNS group this proportion of 
subjects decreased from 17% at baseline to 12.3% at week 24. 
Resistance to tobramycin increased after exposure to TNS from 29% at baseline to 37% of subjects at 
week 24, whereas in AZLI-treated subjects without TNS exposure during the trial this proportion with 
resistance to TNS slightly decreased from 31% at baseline to 27% of subjects at week 24. 
These microbiological findings were already reported as a serious risk in previous assessment reports. 
The combination of a lack of eradication of PA in lungs of CF patients, with increasing MICs for 
aztreonam and appearance of cross resistance to bêta-lactam antibiotics after exposure to aztreonam 
in the resident PA colonies – all more frequent than after treatment with TNS – plus an increase in 
MRSA isolation in AZLI treated subjects, is of major concern as it may compromise future treatment

options and thus worsen lung function.  
These perspectives seriously influence the risk-benefit ratio of AZLI as a treatment option in young 
AZLI patients and should be included as a warning in the SmPC.  RMP needs to be updated.  
Supplementary information provided during this procedure 
In submitted supplementary information, the MAH re-iterated that AZLI treatment was not associated 
with a strong decrease in aztreonam susceptibility or the development of cross-resistance to IV beta-
lactam antibiotics among paediatric subjects in GS-US-205-0110. Importantly, PA parenteral 
resistance to aztreonam in paediatric subjects was not predictive of clinical efficacy, an observation 
that is consistent with previous findings that there is no correlation between in vitro PA susceptibility 
and clinical response to antibiotics in patients with CF. Furthermore, it was argued that AZLI treatment 
did not lead to the emergence of MRSA in paediatric subjects.  
Comment: 
Treatment of chronic PA infection in CF requires repeated courses of antibiotics (both inhalational and 
intravenous) which inherently result in increased MICs of PA to those antibiotics and to selection of 
other multidrug resistant microorganisms (e.g. Burkholderia, MRSA). Regardless of these issues, 
considering the increased survival of CF-patients due to administration of antibiotics, this strategy is 
now mainstay of guidelines. 
However, the development of (cross)-resistance progresses differently between various antibiotics and 
these relative differences were evident in the comparison of AZLI and TNS, although the clinical 
consequences were not noticed during the period of the study of maximum 48 weeks. Since the 
resistance-trends in AZLI-treated subjects were unfavorable compared to those treated with TNS, the 
risk of development of (cross)-resistance in the initial stage of disease negatively influenced the benefit 
risk ratio of AZLI as a treatment of chronic PA infection in pediatric patients as compared to TNS, 
because of the life long treatment and decrease in therapeutic options. 
1.  MIC: various parameters were explored in the total study population as extensively evaluated in 
the assessment report: a) MIC50 and MIC90 changes in all PA isolates and b) those in the least 
susceptible PA isolate, and c) increases in the proportion of PA isolates with MIC>8 (= parenteral 
breakpoint). Different measures, such as geometric MIC in paediatric subjects were not part of the 
initially presented data. 
a.  Ad a): MIC90 increased more than 4 fold after repeated courses of AZLI in some 
subjects.  
b.  Ad b): a 4-fold increase in MIC for aztreonam in the least susceptible PA isolate was 
reported for 35% of subjects at week 24, whereas in the TNS group only 20% of 
subjects that were exposed to tobramycin demonstrated a 4-fold increase in MIC for 
tobramycin. 
c.  Ad c): At baseline 39 AZLI-treated patients (34%) had a PA isolate with aztreonam MIC 
>8 μg/mL and at week 24 in total 56 patients (49%) treated with AZLI had a PA isolate 
with aztreonam MIC > 8 μg/mL. 
As such, these data should be included in the SmPC. Based on these observations a good monitoring of 
the emergence of PA resistance to aztreonam after AZLI treatment and consequences for the 
treatment of systemic infections warrants inclusion of appropriate information in section 4.4 and 5.1 of 
the SmPC in the upcoming Variation application. These sections should contain information on the: 
 
increase in MIC90 of Aztreonam in PA, 
Assessment report  
EMA/571864/2012  
Page 60/80
 
 
 
 
 
 
increase in the proportion of subjects with MIC > 8 (parenteral breakpoint) 
after repeated administration of AZLI. The MAH is requested to add these relevant warnings to the 
SmPC, since repeated determination of susceptibility of PA to administered antibiotics is part of the 
diagnostic routine in most CF centres. These observations did not influence the increase in FEV1 during 
the study period, but are clinically relevant. 
2.  Based on 48 week data, the MAH claims that the decrease in susceptibility to aztreonam of PA does 
not translate into clinical deterioration per se, which has not been evaluated over decades in 
paediatric patients who require repeated courses of inhalation antibiotics during their life with CF. 
Furthermore, two other concerns negatively influenced the risk benefit ratio of AZLI in paediatric 
patients: 
a.  Increase in MIC in other bêta-lactam antibiotics was shown in all subjects (adults and 
children): an increase in PA resistance rates to at least 1 bêta-lactam antibiotic during 
treatment was demonstrated in AZLI: from baseline (week 0/2) 55.7% to 66.7% in 
week 24, whereas in TNS this proportion remained the same (baseline 57.3% to 
58.3% in week 24). In addition, resistance to all bêta-lactam antibiotics in at least 1 
isolate was demonstrated in 13% in the AZLI group at baseline which increased to 
18.4% at week 24. However, in the TNS group this proportion of subjects decreased 
from 17% at baseline to 12.3% at week 24. The now presented data on the subgroup 
of paediatric patients is not sufficiently powered to diminish the concern based on the 
overall observations. Consequently,  
  Monitoring of MICs of bêta-lactams should be part of the RMP and be part of 
the PIP 
 
In the SmPC these proportions should be mentioned to inform physicians on 
possible changes in susceptibility of PA isolates, even though the clinical 
consequences are not known at this stage  
b.  MRSA: more treatment emergent isolation MRSA was reported in the AZLI-treated 
patients compared to TNS (12% versus 1%). Extension data did not reveal worsening 
trends. The total number of subjects in GS-US-250-110 with persistent colonization 
with MRSA was low (n=4). MRSA eradication is only possible with aggressive treatment 
and rigorous patient segregation and might only then result in clearance in up to 80% 
of subjects in some CF centers (Doe, J Cyst Fibr, 2010), but no data is provided 
whether TNS-treated patients were subject to such treatment regimens, although 
reportedly more anti-Staphylococcus concomitant medication usage was used by TNS-
treated subjects (9.1%) compared to AZLI-treated subjects (4.4%). This imbalance in 
use of anti-MRSA drugs is unlikely of influence on the different treatment emergent 
MRSA isolation rates and should not be incorporated in the SmPC as an explanation of 
differences in MRSA isolation rates, but the isolation of MRSA should. 
  Monitoring of persistent colonization with MRSA should be part of the RMP

Discussion on clinical safety 
No additional AEs or ADRs are observed in study CP-AI-003, CP-AI-005 and CP-AI-007. Although 
pyrexia show similar frequencies in the adults population, in paediatric patients pyrexia shows higher 
frequencies (6-12 years: 25% (n=5) and 13-17 years: 16.1%, n=9). Study CP-AI-006 did not show 
any extra AEs or ADRs. 
The reported AEs in study GS-US-205-0110 are in the same order of frequency between paediatric and 
adults. Cough and reproductive cough most commonly reported. Pyrexia and haemoptysis was 
reported more frequently in paediatric patients. Pyrexia was reported in children <18 years of age in 
46.4% of the AZLI- and 41.9% of the TNS treated groups. Haemoptysis was reported in adolescents 
aged 13 to 17 years in 21.4% of the AZLI-treated subjects vs 4.3% of the TNS-treated subjects.  
Pyrexia is stated in section 4.8 of the SmPC, as “very common”. 
Based  on  the  review  of  the  safety  profile  of  AZLI  in  paediatric  patients,  AZLI  appears  to  be  well-
tolerated  in  paediatric  patients  aged  6  years  and  older,  although  exposure  was  limited.  However 
haemoptysis  is  of  concern  especially  in  children.  An  increase  in  frequency  has  been  observed  in  the 
long  term  study  GS-US-205-0110.  Although  the  MAH  explained  that  haemoptysis  is  not  an  ADR  but 
related  to  bronchospams,  haemoptysis  must  be  included  in  the  RMP  as  an  identified  risk.  Moreover 
haemoptysis is to be included in section 4.8 of the SmPC and a warning should be added to section 4.4 
preferably with a subsection labeled “Haemoptysis”.  
The CHMP agrees with the MAH that the higher incidence of hospitalization in paediatric patients can be 
attributed to the severity of CF in children and the prevailing standard of care. 
No specific microbiology data with respect to paediatric patients was provided for this variation. 
From the long term study GS-US-205-0110, it can be concluded that in the TNS-treated patient group 
that the MSRA reduced from 20.0% at baseline (week -2) to 10.6% by week 24. In the AZLI-treated 
group the presence of MRSA was 17.4% at baseline (week -2) and remained similar in week 24 
(19.8%). However in the extension phase of the same study (where all patients were continued on 
AZLI) it is shown that the reduction of MRSA remains similar for all patients (AZLI/AZLI and 
TNS/AZLI). With respect to MSSA it was observed that in the extension phase patients on AZLI/AZLI 
had same frequencies of MSSA, however an increase in the presence of MSSA was noticed in patients 
previously on TNS. 
Furthermore it is shown that patients treated with AZLI had increasing PA from baseline (week -2) 
97.0% to 91.3% in week 24. In contrast patients treated with TNS showed a reduction in PA from 
baseline (week -2) 92.3% to 85.8% in week 24. 
Conclusions on clinical safety 
Haemoptysis is of concern, especially in children. The RMP and SmPC are updated in this respect. 
Differential development of increases in MIC, appearance of cross resistance and possibly persistent 
colonization with MRSA is evident in the CF patients treated with AZLI compared to TNS. The long term 
clinical outcomes and differences (i.e., decrease in FEV1 and possible increased need of respiratory 
hospitalizations) beyond 48 weeks are not known. By adding this information in the SmPC in section 
4.4 and 5.1 physicians should be informed about the changes in MICs that can be expected in 
diagnostic routine. The RMP should contain plans for the observation of these changes and MRSA

Allergic Reactions 
If an allergic reaction to Cayston does 
occur, stop administration of the 
medicinal product and initiate treatment 
as appropriate. The occurrence of rash 
may be indicative of an allergic reaction 
to Cayston. 
Cross-reactivity may occur in patients 
with a history of allergy to beta-lactam 
antibiotics, such as penicillins, 
cephalosporins, and/or carbapenems. 
Animal and human data demonstrate low 
risk of cross-reactivity between 
aztreonam and beta-lactam antibiotics. 
Aztreonam, a monobactam, is only 
weakly immunogenic. Caution is advised 
when administering Cayston to patients if 
they have a history of beta-lactam 
allergy. 
The following rare and severe adverse 
reactions, although these have not been 
observed to date with Cayston, have 
been reported after parenteral use of

Section 5.1 of Cayston SmPC: 
Mechanisms of resistance 
Loss of susceptibility to aztreonam in CF 
patients with P. aeruginosa occurs either 
through selection of strains with 
mutations located on the chromosome or 
rarely through acquisition of 
plasmid/integrin mediated genes. 
Known mechanisms of resistance to 
aztreonam mediated by mutation of 
chromosomal genes include: 
hyperexpression of the Class C 
beta-lactamase AmpC and up-regulation 
of the efflux pump MexAB OprM. The 
known mechanism of resistance to 
aztreonam mediated by acquisition of 
genes involves acquisition of extended 
spectrum beta-lactam enzymes (ESBLs) 
that hydrolyse the four-member, 
nitrogen-containing ring of aztreonam. 
ESBLs from Class A, B and D beta-
lactamases generally have little or no 
activity against aztreonam. Class A beta-
lactamases reported to hydrolyse 
aztreonam include the VEB type 
(primarily Southeast Asia), PER type 
(Turkey), and GES and IBC types 
(France, Greece, and S. Africa). There are 
rare reports of organisms with metallo-
beta-lactamases (MBLs), Class B, that are 
resistant to aztreonam, VIM 5 
(K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa -

Turkey), VIM 6 (P. putida - Singapore) 
and VIM 7 (P. aeruginosa - United 
States), however, it is possible that these 
organisms were expressing multiple 
resistance mechanisms and thus a MBL 
was not responsible for the observed 
resistance to aztreonam. There are rare 
reports of Class D beta-lactamases from 
clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa, OXA 11 
(Turkey) and OXA 45 (United States) that 
hydrolyse aztreonam. 
Microbiology 
A single sputum sample from a CF patient 
may contain multiple isolates of 
P. aeruginosa and each isolate may have 
a different level of in vitro susceptibility 
to aztreonam. The in vitro antimicrobial 
susceptibility test methods used for 
parenteral aztreonam therapy can be 
used to monitor the susceptibility of 
P. aeruginosa isolated from CF patients. 
In the Phase 3 placebo-controlled studies 
of Cayston, local aztreonam 
concentrations generally exceeded 
aztreonam MIC values for P. aeruginosa, 
regardless of the level of P. aeruginosa 
susceptibility. 
Treatment with up to nine 28 day 
courses of 75 mg 3 times a day Cayston 
therapy resulted in clinically important 
improvements in respiratory symptoms, 
pulmonary function, and sputum P. 
aeruginosa CFU density; no increases in 
P. aeruginosa MIC 50 (± 2 dilution 
change) were observed, whereas 
MIC90 increased intermittently to 4 
times the initial MIC. In a 24-week 
active-controlled study of Cayston 
therapy, no increases in P. 
aeruginosa MIC50 (± 2 dilution 
change) were observed, whereas 
MIC90 increased to 4 times the initial 
MIC. At the end of the study, the 
percentage of patients with 
aztreonam MIC for P. aeruginosa 
above the parenteral breakpoint (> 8 
µg/ml) increased from 34% at 
baseline to 49%, the percentage of 
patients with P. aeruginosa resistant 
to at least 1 beta-lactam antibiotic 
increased from 56% at baseline to 
67%, and the percentage of patients 
with P. aeruginosa resistant to all 6 
beta-lactam antibiotics tested 
increased from 13% at baseline to 
18%. There is a risk that P. 
aeruginosa isolates may develop

resistance to aztreonam or other

treated with Cayston. The emergence 
of parenteral P. aeruginosa 
resistance to aztreonam and other 
beta-lactam antibiotics may have 
potential consequences for the 
treatment of acute pulmonary 
exacerbations with systemic 
antibiotics. However, similar 
improvements in lung function were 
seen after treatment with Cayston 
among patients with aztreonam 
susceptible or resistant P. aeruginosa 
isolates. 
In studies of up to nine 28-day 
courses of Cayston therapy, no 
increases of clinical significance were 
observed in the treatment-emergent 
isolation of other gram-negative 
bacterial respiratory pathogens 
(Burkholderia species, 
Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and 
Alcaligenes species). During the 6-
month randomised phase of Study 
GS-US-205-0110, treatment-
emergent isolation of MSSA and 
MRSA was observed more commonly 
among Cayston-treated patients than 
Tobramycin Nebuliser Solution 
(TNS)-treated patients. The majority 
of the treatment- emergent isolations 
were intermittent. Treatment-
emergent persistent isolation 
(defined as absent at 
screening/baseline then present at 3 
or more subsequent consecutive 
visits) of MSSA occurred in 6% of 
Cayston-treated patients compared 
to 3% of TNS-treated patients. 
Treatment-emergent persistent 
isolation of MRSA occurred in 3% of 
Cayston-treated patients compared 
to no TNS-treated patients. An 
association between persistent 
isolation of MRSA and more severe 
disease and increased mortality has 
been reported in the literature. 
During clinical studies of Cayston, 
isolation of MRSA did not result in 
worsening of lung function.

aeruginosa in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) aged 6 years and older. 
Assessment report

Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Patients should use a bronchodilator before each dose of Cayston.  Short acting bronchodilators can be 
taken between 15 minutes and 4 hours and long acting bronchodilators can be taken between 
30 minutes and 12 hours prior to each dose of Cayston. 
For patients taking multiple inhaled therapies, the recommended order of administration is as follows: 
bronchodilator 
1. 
2.  mucolytics 
3. 
and lastly, Cayston. 
Adults 
The recommended dose for adults is 75 mg three times per 24 hours for 28 days. 
Doses should be taken at least 4 hours apart. 
Cayston may be taken in repeated cycles of 28 days on therapy followed by 28 days off Cayston 
therapy. 
Paediatric population 
Cayston is indicated in children aged 6 years and older.  In clinical studies with Cayston patients 
younger than 6 years of age were excluded.  The safety and efficacy of Cayston in children younger 
than 6 years of age has not been established.  The dosing in children aged 6 years and older is the 
same as for adults.  Dosage is not based on weight or adjusted for age. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
[…] 
The following rare and severe adverse reactions have not been observed to date with Cayston, but 
have been reported after parenteral use of other aztreonam containing products: toxic epidermal 
necrolysis, anaphylaxis, purpura, erythema multiforme, exfoliative dermatitis, urticaria, petechiae, 
pruritus, diaphoresis. 
Bronchospasm 
Bronchospasm is a complication associated with nebulised therapies.  Patients were pre-treated with a 
bronchodilator before dosing with study therapy.  In placebo-controlled studies, an acute reduction of 
≥ 15% in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) following administration of study therapy was 
observed in 3% of patients treated with Cayston and 4% of patients receiving placebo despite pre-
treatment with a bronchodilator before dosing with study therapy.  Patients should use a 
bronchodilator before each dose of Cayston.  If a case of bronchospasm is suspected to be part of an 
allergic reaction appropriate measures should be taken (see “allergic reactions” paragraph above). 
Other precautions 
Efficacy has not been established in patients with FEV1 > 75% predicted.  Patients with Burkholderia 
cepacia isolated from sputum within the previous 2 years were excluded from the clinical studies. 
Aztreonam for injection must not be used in the Altera or other nebulisers.  Aztreonam for injection 
has not been formulated for inhalation, and contains arginine, a substance known to cause pulmonary 
inflammation.

The development of antibiotic-resistant P. aeruginosa and superinfection with other pathogens 
represent potential risks associated with antibiotic therapy.  Development of resistance during inhaled 
aztreonam therapy could limit treatment options during acute exacerbations.  A decrease in 
P. aeruginosa susceptibility to aztreonam and other beta-lactam antibiotics was observed in clinical 
studies of Cayston.  In a 24-week active-controlled clinical study of Cayston therapy, increases were 
observed in the MIC90 for all P. aeruginosa isolates as well as in the percentages of patients with 
P. aeruginosa resistant (MIC above the parenteral breakpoint) to aztreonam, to at least 1 beta-lactam 
antibiotic, and to all 6 beta-lactam antibiotics tested (see section 5.1).  However, decreased 
P. aeruginosa susceptibility was not predictive of clinical efficacy of Cayston during the study. Among 
patients with multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa, improvements in respiratory symptoms and pulmonary 
function were observed following treatment with Cayston.  The emergence of parenteral P. aeruginosa 
resistance to aztreonam or other beta-lactam antibiotics may have potential consequences for the 
treatment of acute pulmonary exacerbations with systemic antibiotics. 
An increased prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-sensitive S. 
aureus (MSSA), Aspergillus and Candida species was observed over time in patients treated with 
several Cayston treatment courses.  An association between persistent isolation of MRSA and worse 
clinical outcome has been reported in the literature.  During clinical studies of Cayston, isolation of 
MRSA did not result in worsening of lung function. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
a. Summary of the safety profile 
Assessment of adverse reactions is based on experience in four Phase 3 clinical studies involving 
CF patients (n = 539) and post-marketing spontaneous reporting.  In two Phase 3 placebo-controlled 
studies patients received Cayston 75 mg 2 times (69 patients) or 3 times a day (146 patients) for 
28 days.  In one Phase 3 open-label follow-on study 274 patients received up to nine 28-day treatment 
courses of Cayston 75 mg 2 times or 3 times a day.  In one Phase 3 active-controlled study, 
136 patients received up to three 28-day courses of Cayston 75 mg 3 times a day during the 
randomised phase; an additional 65 patients received up to three 28-day courses in an open-label 
extension phase. 
c. Description of selected adverse reactions 
[…] 
The following rare and severe adverse reactions have not been observed to date with Cayston, but 
have been reported after parenteral use of other aztreonam containing products: toxic epidermal 
necrolysis, anaphylaxis, purpura, erythema multiforme, exfoliative dermatitis, urticaria, petechiae, 
pruritus, diaphoresis. 
d. Paediatric population 
A total of 137 paediatric patients aged 6 to 17 years with FEV1 ≤ 75% predicted have received 
Cayston in Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies (6-12 years, n = 35; 13-17 years, n = 102). 
In Phase 2 and Phase 3 placebo-controlled clinical studies of Cayston, pyrexia was observed at a higher 
incidence rate in paediatric patients aged 6 to 17 years (18%) compared to adults (8%).

however, it is possible that these organisms were expressing multiple resistance mechanisms and thus 
a MBL was not responsible for the observed resistance to aztreonam.  There are rare reports of Class D 
beta-lactamases from clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa, OXA-11 (Turkey) and OXA-45 (United States) 
that hydrolyse aztreonam.

Treatment with up to nine 28-day courses of 75 mg 3 times a day Cayston therapy resulted in clinically 
important improvements in respiratory symptoms, pulmonary function, and sputum P. aeruginosa CFU 
density; no increases in P. aeruginosa MIC50 (± 2 dilution change) were observed, whereas MIC90 
increased intermittently to 4 times the initial MIC.  In a 24-week active-controlled study of Cayston 
therapy, no increases in P. aeruginosa MIC50 (± 2 dilution change) were observed, whereas MIC90 
increased to 4 times the initial MIC.  At the end of the study, the percentage of patients with 
aztreonam MIC for P. aeruginosa above the parenteral breakpoint (> 8 µg/ml) increased from 34% at 
baseline to 49%, the percentage of patients with P. aeruginosa resistant to at least 1 beta-lactam 
antibiotic increased from 56% at baseline to 67%, and the percentage of patients with P. aeruginosa 
resistant to all 6 beta-lactam antibiotics tested increased from 13% at baseline to 18%.  There is a risk 
that P. aeruginosa isolates may develop resistance to aztreonam or other beta-lactam antibiotics in 
patients treated with Cayston.  The emergence of parenteral P. aeruginosa resistance to aztreonam 
and other beta-lactam antibiotics may have potential consequences for the treatment of acute 
pulmonary exacerbations with systemic antibiotics.  However, similar improvements in lung function 
were seen after treatment with Cayston among patients with aztreonam susceptible or resistant 
P. aeruginosa isolates. 
In studies of up to nine 28-day courses of Cayston therapy, no increases of clinical significance were 
observed in the treatment-emergent isolation of other gram-negative bacterial respiratory pathogens 
(Burkholderia species, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Alcaligenes species).  During the 6-month 
randomised phase of study GS-US-205-0110, treatment-emergent isolation of MSSA and MRSA was 
observed more commonly among Cayston-treated patients than Tobramycin Nebuliser Solution (TNS)-
treated patients.  The majority of the treatment-emergent isolations were intermittent.  Treatment-
emergent persistent isolation (defined as absent at screening/baseline then present at 3 or more 
subsequent consecutive visits) of MSSA occurred in 6% of Cayston-treated patients compared to 3% of 
TNS-treated patients.  Treatment-emergent intermittent isolation of MRSA occurred in 7% of Cayston-
treated patients compared to 1% of TNS-treated patients and treatment-emergent persistent isolation 
of MRSA occurred in 3% of Cayston-treated patients compared to no TNS-treated patients.  An 
association between persistent isolation of MRSA and more severe disease and increased mortality has 
been reported in the literature.  During clinical studies of Cayston, isolation of MRSA did not result in 
worsening of lung function. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Cayston was compared to TNS over three 28-day courses of treatment in a randomised, active-
controlled, multicenter study (GS-US-205-0110).  Patients participating in this study in Europe who 
completed at least 1 course of Cayston or TNS during the randomised phase could subsequently 
receive up to three 28-day courses of Cayston in an open-label extension phase.  Entry criteria 
included CF, FEV1 ≤ 75% predicted, stable pulmonary disease, a recent positive sputum culture for 
P. aeruginosa, and previous treatment with aerosolised antibiotics without demonstration of drug 
intolerance. 
Cayston was evaluated over a period of 28-days of treatment (one course) in two randomised, double-
blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre studies (CP-AI-005 and CP-AI-007).  Patients participating in 
these studies could subsequently receive multiple courses of Cayston in an open-label follow-on study 
(CP-AI-006).  Entry criteria included CF, baseline FEV1 between 25% and 75% predicted, and chronic 
P. aeruginosa lung infection. 
Overall, 539 patients (78% adults) were treated in these studies.  Studies were conducted using the 
Altera Nebuliser System to administer Cayston.

GS-US-205-0110 
In GS-US-205-0110, 268 patients with CF and chronic P. aeruginosa lung infection were randomised 
and received Cayston (n = 136) or TNS (n = 132).  Fifty-nine paediatric patients aged 6 to 17 years 
were included in the study.   
Patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Cayston (75 mg) administered by inhalation 
3 times a day or TNS (300 mg) administered 2 times a day.  Treatments were administered for three 
cycles of 28 days on therapy followed by 28 days off therapy.  The co-primary endpoints were non-
inferiority of Cayston to TNS in relative change from baseline to Day 28 in FEV 1 % predicted and 
superiority of Cayston to TNS in actual change from baseline in FEV1 % predicted across 3 treatment 
courses (the average of the actual change in FEV1 % predicted observed at the end of each treatment 
course). 
The adjusted mean percent change from baseline to Day 28 in FEV1 % predicted was 8.35 and 0.55 in 
the Cayston and TNS groups, respectively (treatment difference: 7.80; p = 0.0001; 95% CI: 3.86, 
11.73).  The adjusted mean actual change from baseline in FEV1 % predicted across 3 treatment 
courses was 2.05 and -0.66 in the Cayston and TNS groups, respectively (treatment difference: 2.70; 
p = 0.0023; 95% CI: 0.98, 4.43).  Patients treated with Cayston experienced a longer time to need for 
i.v. antipseudomonal antibiotics related to respiratory events compared to TNS-treated patients 
(p = 0.0025).  The Kaplan-Meier estimates for this event rate at week 24 were 36% in Cayston-treated 
patients and 54% in TNS-treated patients.  Additionally, Cayston-treated patients had fewer 
hospitalisations due to respiratory events (40 versus 58, p = 0.044) and fewer respiratory events 
requiring the use of i.v. or inhaled antipseudomonal antibiotics (84 versus 121, p = 0.004) than TNS-
treated patients.  Cayston-treated patients also demonstrated larger mean improvements in CFQ-R 
respiratory symptoms scores compared to TNS-treated patients across 3 treatment courses (6.30 
versus 2.17, p = 0.019).

previous 12 months (n = 40), lung function improvements at Day 28 and across three 28-day 
treatment courses were numerically smaller among Cayston-treated patients than TNS-treated patients.

Over nine 28-day courses of therapy, measures of pulmonary function (FEV1), CFQ-R respiratory 
symptoms scores, and P. aeruginosa sputum density showed a trend to improvement while the 
patients were on treatment compared with off treatment. 
[…] 
Paediatric population 
A total of 137 paediatric patients aged 6 to 17 years with FEV1 ≤ 75% predicted have received Cayston 
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies.  Paediatric patients had clinical improvements with Cayston as 
determined by an increase in FEV1, improvement in CFQ-R respiratory symptoms scores and decline in 
P. aeruginosa sputum density.  Cayston is indicated for use in paediatric patients aged 6 years and 
older based on the above clinical experience. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
[…] 
Paediatric population 
The Phase 2 and 3 placebo-controlled, registrational studies permitted comparison of plasma 
concentrations 1 hour post dose of Cayston by age (6 to 12 years, 13 to 17 years, and ≥ 18 years).  
Data from these studies revealed minimal differences in mean plasma aztreonam concentrations 
between age groups in patients receiving Cayston 75 mg 3 times a day.

Pooled sputum concentration data from the Phase 2 and 3 registrational studies revealed some 
evidence of lower mean sputum concentrations in patients aged 13 to 17 years following one dose of 
Cayston 75 mg 3 times a day.  However, all mean sputum concentration values were associated with 
relatively large standard deviations. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data

Fertility, teratology, perinatal and postnatal studies were conducted with aztreonam for i.v. injection in 
rats at daily doses up to 750 mg/kg without adverse effects. 
During the procedure, the CHMP requested further amendments to the PI as discussed in detail above. 
The following additional amendments to the Product Information have been agreed:

Haemoptysis 
Inhalation of nebulised solutions may induce a cough reflex.  The use of Cayston in paediatric 
CF patients has been associated with haemoptysis during treatment cycles and could have aggravated 
underlying conditions.  Administration of Cayston in CF patients with active haemoptysis should be 
undertaken only if the benefits of treatment are considered to outweigh the risks of inducing further 
haemorrhage.

Bronchospasm 
Nebulised therapies, including Cayston, may be associated with bronchospasm (an acute reduction of 
≥ 15% in FEV1).  In placebo-controlled studies, bronchospasm was observed in 3% of patients treated 
with Cayston versus 4% of patients treated with placebo, despite pre-treatment with a bronchodilator 
before dosing with study treatment (see section 4.4).

conditions (see section 4.4). 
Allergic reactions 
Rash has been reported with the use of Cayston and may be indicative of an allergic reaction to 
Cayston (see section 4.4). 
Lung function test decreased 
Lung function test decreased has been reported with use of Cayston, but was not associated with a 
sustained decrease in FEV1 (see section 5.1). 
Changes were also made to the PL to bring it in line with the amended SmPC. 
2.7.  Significance of paediatric studies 
The obligation to submit the results of studies with Cayston in one or more subsets of the paediatric 
population in cystic fibrosis patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa pulmonary infection/colonisation 
has been deferred. 
3.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
Cayston (Aztreonam lysine) 75 mg TID (AZLI) has been approved for adult patients with Cystic Fibrosis 
for the suppressive therapy of chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) infection. The current variation 
concerns the extension of use of AZLI to children and adolescents. 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Conservation of lung function in children and adolescents was demonstrated in GS-US-205-0110 that 
was in line with the non-inferiority results in adults compared to TNS. These effects translated into 
favourable CFQ-R RSS scores in paediatric patients and hospitalization rates similar to TNS. The MAH 
has demonstrated that these data were applicable to all subgroups including children and adolescents, 
including patients with increased MIC to aztreonam during the period of observation. Also, in the 24 
week extension phase after the randomisation phase, lung function as measured by FEV1 (expected) 
was maintained after administration of each cycle of AZLI during one month.  
As such, Cayston has demonstrated non-inferiority to Tobramycin inhalation for the same indication: 
“suppressive therapy of chronic PA infection”. 
Risks  
Unfavourable effects 
Repeated rounds of administration of AZLI resulted in the total group (adults and children) in an 
increase in MIC90 to aztreonam in some individuals, an increase in proportions of patients with PA with 
MIC to aztreonam above the parenteral breakpoint (>8 µg/ml), an increase in numbers of PA isolates 
with cross-resistance to betalactam antibiotics, treatment-emerging isolation of MRSA, occurrence of

haemoptysis and direct post-treatment decrease of lung function test 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
MIC to aztreonam: Also in the pivotal trial of tobramycin inhalation in CF patients (Ramsey, NEJM, 
1999), a trend towards an increase in the MIC of tobramycin in the PA isolates from the patients 
receiving tobramycin but not in the isolates from the patients receiving placebo was observed. 
Therefore, these findings are not unexpected. However, although an increase in the MIC90 to 
aztreonam was measured, FEV1 changes were not reversed in these subjects when AZLI was 
administered during the study period. Long term consequences due to acquisition of PA isolates with 
increased MIC to aztreonam associated with inhalation of AZLI in young CF patients are unknown, but 
unfavourable effects might be overcome by alternating antibiotic classes. 
Beta lactam cross resistance: the trends as reported for the total group (adults and children) are 
related to extensive pre-exposure to antibiotics or healthcare associated transmission. Subgroup 
analysis in paediatric patients did not reveal these trends, because of very small numbers and because 
pre-study exposure to antibiotics is more limited than in adult CF patients. Long term consequences 
(i.e., decrease of therapeutic options in case of exacerbations) due to acquisition of PA isolates with 
increased MIC to bêta-lactam antibiotics associated with inhalation of AZLI in young CF patients are yet 
unknown. 
MRSA: most treatment-emergent isolation of MRSA was temporary in the total study population, but 
trends appeared unfavourable in the AZLI-arm. Whether this effect was related to MRSA-suppressive 
therapy with tobramycin in the comparator arm or due to other anti-MRSA medication or healthcare 
associated acquisition is unknown. 
Haemoptysis: in the clinical manifestations of CF, haemoptysis is a common symptom due to 
damaged airways, but causes can be multiple and are not necessarily associated with cough reflex 
provoked by inhalational antibiotics. The latter factor could have contributed to some of the 12 
episodes of haemoptysis in the paediatric AZLI-arm in 8 on-treatment episodes, but the MAH attributes 
other factors to these occurrences, since in placebo-controlled studies an increased incidence of 
haemoptysis was not noticed in the AZLI-arm.  
Lung function test decreased: during repeated cycles of administration a substantial proportion 
(40%) had an immediate post-treatment decreased lung function, which did not negatively influence 
the FEV 1 endpoint. This effect is a known temporary consequence of inhalation antibiotics, but clinical 
consequences (e.g. haemoptysis) are unknown. Regardless of this AE in a substantial proportion of 
subjects, the TID administration of AZLI compared to BID TNS apparently didn’t result in lower patient 
satisfaction as measured by CFQ-R RSS score. 
Balance 
The conservation of lung function in young CF patients due to AZLI was evident in the comparison with 
TNS, whereas the observed negative clinical consequences of MIC changes are yet unknown. 
Concerning the two AEs (haemoptysis, lung function test decreased), the issue is not whether AZLI is 
associated with an increased frequency of these symptoms compared to other agents or placebo, but 
at least the reported association in CF patients should be mentioned in the SmPC. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Since the benefits of adding an additional inhalational antibiotic of a different class to the therapeutic 
Assessment report

arsenal in the treatment of chronic PA infection in CF patients have been established and antibiotic 
therapy courses of different classes may be alternated, the observed risks may be limited. The 
observations of MIC changes and haemoptysis/decreased lung function test are included in the SmPC 
(sections 4.4 and 4.8 respectively). 
Discussion on the benefit-risk assessment 
The benefit risk is considered positive. Regardless of a potential negative effect of observed 
microbiological trends, FEV 1 function was maintained or showed favourable results during at least 48 
weeks. Whether these trends, observed in the total population (adults and children) in the comparative 
study of AZLI versus TNS, might compromise future treatment strategies of chronic PA infection in 
paediatric CF patients is yet unknown. Likely developments will include alternating treatment regimens 
using various antibiotics for the treatment of chronic PA infection in CF. Since various classes are now 
approved, (temporary) class-resistance might be counteracted by switching between classes if 
tolerated by patients. As one of the treatment options, AZLI can decrease the decline of lung function 
deterioration in CF resulting from chronic PA infection and has shown to delay hospitalization due to 
respiratory events. 
Long term data of the influence of the trends in increase of MIC of aztreonam and bêta-lactams on 
both hospitalization rates or lung function deterioration will be collected as outlined in the RMP, since 
the long term consequences in the young population of CF patients are yet unknown. The MAH is 
requested to specifically monitor these issues in the approved PIP-studies as well.  Since MRSA was 
mostly intermittently isolated and permanent isolation was rather rare, at least monitoring of MRSA 
isolation rates in the PIP-studies, in larger groups and during longer periods is required.

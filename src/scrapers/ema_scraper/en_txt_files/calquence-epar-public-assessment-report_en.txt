2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most common form of leukaemia in Europe and North 
America, and mainly, though not exclusively, affects older individuals. The World Health Organization 
(WHO) classification of hematopoietic neoplasias describes CLL as leukemic, lymphocytic lymphoma, 
being only distinguishable from SLL (small lymphocytic lymphoma) by its leukemic manifestation. In 
the WHO classification, CLL, by definition, is always a disease of neoplastic B-cells, while the entity 
formerly described as T-CLL is now called T-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia (T-PLL). 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
CLL is a malignancy of B cells that predominantly affects an elderly population. It is the most prevalent 
form of adult leukaemia, with an age-adjusted incidence of 3.3–6.4 per 100,000 person-years and a 
median age at diagnosis of 70 years. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
The leukaemia cells found in the blood smear are characteristically small, mature lymphocytes with a 
narrow border of cytoplasm and a dense nucleus lacking discernible nucleoli and having partially 
aggregated chromatin. Gumprecht nuclear shadows, or smudge cells, found as cellular debris, are 
additional morphologic features commonly associated with CLL. A small percentage of larger or atypical 
cells or prolymphocytes can be found admixed with morphologically typical CLL cells. Finding ≥ 55% 
prolymphocytes would favour a diagnosis of prolymphocytic leukaemia (B-cell PLL). However, the 
diagnosis of B-cell PLL remains difficult and is solely based on morphological criteria, because no 
reliable immunological or genetic marker has been identified. A significant proportion of circulating 
prolymphocytes (≥ 10%) seems to indicate a more aggressive form of CLL (with NOTCH1 or genetic 
TP53 aberrations). 
The definition of SLL requires the presence of lymphadenopathy and the absence of cytopenias caused 
by a clonal marrow infiltrate. Additionally, the number of B lymphocytes in the peripheral blood should 
be < 5.000/µL. In SLL, the diagnosis should be confirmed by histopathological evaluation of a lymph 
node biopsy or biopsy of other tissues. Some patients may present with enlarged lymph nodes that are 
not suspicious for solid tumours and with peripheral blood B lymphocytes < 5.000/µL that carry a 
typical CLL immunophenotype. In these cases, a tissue or lymph node biopsy to establish the diagnosis 
of SLL may have limited clinical consequences and be omitted.  
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
The diagnosis of CLL requires the presence of ≥ 5.000 B-lymphocytes/µL in the peripheral blood, 
sustained for at least 3 months. The clonality of these B-lymphocytes needs to be confirmed by 
demonstrating immunoglobulin light chain restriction using flow cytometry.  
Diagnosis is established using peripheral blood and immunophenotyping and requires a minimum of 5 
x 109 monoclonal B cells that co-express the surface antigens CD5, CD19, CD20, and CD23. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/458179/2020  
Page 10/147 
 
 
 
CLL has a variable course, with survival ranging from months to decades. Major progress has been 
made in identification of molecular and cellular markers that could predict disease progression in 
patients with CLL. In particular, the mutational profile of immunoglobulin genes and some cytogenetic 
abnormalities are important predictors of prognosis. Available treatments generally induce remission, 
although nearly all patients relapse, and CLL remains an incurable disease.  
2.1.5.  Management 
The treatment of CLL has evolved significantly over the last several decades. While alkylator therapy 
was used in the past (O'Brien et al. 1995), randomised trials have demonstrated a higher response 
rate and longer progression-free survival (PFS) with fludarabine-and cyclophosphamide-based 
combinations in young, fit patients with CLL (Johnson et al. 1996; Raiet al. 2000;Leporrier et al. 
2001;Eichhorst et al. 2006;Catovsky et al. 2007; Flinnet al. 2007).  
At the same time, the chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab was introduced for the 
treatment of CLL (Byrd et al. 2001, O'Brien et al. 2001). The efficacy of rituximab has been improved 
by combining it with traditional cytotoxic agents such as fludarabine (Byrd et al. 2003, Byrd et al. 
2005) or fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide (Wierdaet al. 2005), which have produced high complete 
remission (CR) rates and extended PFS compared with historical controls. A large randomised clinical 
trial, reported by the German CLL study group, has shown the benefit of the addition of rituximab to 
fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FCR) in PFS and overall survival (OS) in patients with previously 
untreated CLL (Hallek et al. 2010). Bendamustine in combination with rituximab (BR) has also been 
studied in frontline CLL and was found to be less toxic, but also less efficacious than FCR (Eichhorst et 
al. 2016. 
Patients who have high risk cytogenetics such as deletions in the long arm of chromosome 11 (11q 
del) or in the short arm of chromosome 17 (17p del) have inferior outcomes and may prove to be 
refractory to therapy and/or experience short remission durations and rapid progression of disease 
when treated with standard and currently available treatment regimens (Halleket al. 2010, Hillmenet 
al. 2007). In addition, elderly patients and those with comorbidities are often unable to tolerate 
combination chemoimmunotherapy regimens, or experience inferior clinical outcomes when treated 
with these regimens. 
Currently, CLL remains an incurable disease with relapse inevitable and most patients requiring 
multiple lines of therapy. Therapeutic choice after relapse requires the evaluation of the intensity of the 
previous therapies, the duration of response (DOR) to those therapies, and patient comorbidities. 
Allogeneic stem cell transplant is only recommended in eligible patients with high-risk disease failing 
novel targeted therapies (i.e. BTK and BCL2 inhibitors). In the last decade, anti-CD20 monoclonal 
antibodies (obinutuzumab, ofatumumab) were added to new and effective combination regimens. The 
development of targeted therapies against B cell markers/antigens or against components of the B-cell 
receptor (BCR) such as BTK inhibitor (ibrutinib), BCL2 inhibitor (venetoclax) or PI3Kδ inhibitor 
(idelalisib) have demonstrated efficacy with less toxicity (Wiestner 2015).

About the product 
Acalabrutinib (ACP-196), known chemically as (S)-4-(8-amino-3-(1-but-2-ynoylpyrrolidin-2- yl)-
imidazo[1,5-α]pyrazin-1-yl)-N-(pyridin-2-yl)-benzamide, is a highly selective, potent, orally 
bioavailable, covalent inhibitor of BTK. Acalabrutinib forms a covalent bond with Cys481 in the BTK 
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) pocket, permanently inactivating the enzyme and resulting in the 
inhibition of proliferation and survival signals in malignant B cells. Acalabrutinib has an active 
metabolite, ACP-5862, that is also a covalent inhibitor of BTK. Biochemical profiling showed that the 
Assessment report

pharmacological activity and kinase selectivity profile for ACP-5862 was comparable to that of 
acalabrutinib.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of acalabrutinib is 4-{8-amino-3-[(2S)-1-(but-2-ynoyl)pyrrolidin-2-yl]imidazo[1,5-
a]pyrazin-1-yl}-N-(pyridine-2-yl)benzamide and its molecular formula and relative molecular mass are 
C26H23N7O2 and 465.51 respectively. Acalabrutinib has one chiral centre and is the (S)-enantiomer. Its 
chemical structure is presented in Figure 2. 
Figure 2: active substance structure 
Full information on the active substance has been provided in the dossier by the MAH. The chemical 
structure of acalabrutinib was inferred from the route of synthesis and elucidated by a combination of 
mass spectrometry (MS), 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), infrared 
spectroscopy (IR), elemental analysis, and ultraviolet spectroscopy (UV). In addition, the (S)-
configuration of acalabrutinib was confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/458179/2020  
Page 13/147 
 
 
 
 
The solid-state properties of the active substance were measured by gravimetric vapour sorption, 
differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis. Acalabrutinib is a non-hygroscopic 
white to yellow crystalline powder. It exhibits pH-dependent solubility in aqueous media. Extensive 
polymorph screening identified several metastable anhydrous forms as well as hydrates and solvates.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Acalabrutinib is synthesised using well-defined starting materials with acceptable specifications. The 
applicant sought scientific advice on the choice of starting materials and CHMP recommended that they 
be re-defined. During this procedure, the applicant was able to able to provide data on impurity fate 
and purge and an updated control strategy was presented in order to justify the originally proposed 
starting materials. This was accepted by CHMP and they are considered to be acceptable in line with 
the principles of ICH Q11 and its Q&A.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials, reagents, solvents and auxiliary materials have been 
presented and are found acceptable. Risk management and scientific knowledge have been used to 
understand process parameters and unit operations that impact critical quality attributes (CQAs) of the 
active substance and to develop the proposed control strategy. The control strategy consists of control 
of process parameters, raw material quality, in-process controls (IPCs) and release testing of the 
active substance. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with 
regards to their origin, fate and purge and are adequately characterised.  
The manufacturing process development work has been described in sufficient detail. The commercial 
manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the clinical development 
program and changes introduced were not extensive and were designed to improve the robustness of 
the manufacturing process and active substance. The changes have been presented in sufficient detail 
and have been justified. The proposed late development process can be considered suitable and results 
in a reproducible active substance with high purity. 
The  active  substance  is  packaged  in  double  LDPE  bags  inside  a  rigid  drum.  The  primary  packaging 
material complies with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identity (IR), assay (HPLC), impurities 
(HPLC), mutagenic impurity (LCMS), enantiomeric purity (chiral HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water 
content (KF), particle size distribution (laser diffraction) and residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.). 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. The limit for the 
mutagenic impurity has been set in line with ICH M7 and considering the 1-10 year treatment duration. 
The limits for particle size are set in line with the clinical batches, also considering the high aqueous 
solubility at gastric pH. 
The absence of tests for elemental impurities, some residual solvents used early in the process, 
polymorphism and microbial testing has been acceptably justified by the applicant.

The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data from several pilot to production scale batches of active substance from the 
proposed commercial manufacturer are provided. The results are within the specifications and 
consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from 3 pilot scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored in 
the intended commercial package for up to 24 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) 
and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines 
were provided. In addition, supportive data from 3 larger scale batches from a previous manufacturer 
were provided as supporting information. The following parameters were tested: description, assay, 
impurities, enantiomeric purity, particle size, and water content. The supportive batches were also 
studied for polymorphic form and microbiological content. No significant changes to any of the studied 
attributes were observed. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on 1 batch. Acalabrutinib is not 
photosensitive. 
Results under stressed conditions were also provided. No significant degradation was observed in the 
solid state (up to 50 °C for 3 months). Forced degradation studies were performed to elucidate 
degradation pathways and to conform the suitability of the analytical methods applied. Studies were 
performed using acalabrutinib in aqueous solutions or suspensions at pH 1, 7, and 13 and under 
oxidative conditions. Degradation was observed under acidic, basic, and oxidative conditions.  
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 36 months stored below 30 
°C in the proposed container.

The formulation development was performed to meet the criteria described in the Quality Target 
Product Profile (QTPP): an oral immediate release capsule containing acalabrutinib able to meet the 
clinical need and quality and pharmacopoeial requirements including purity and free from microbial 
contamination. 
Acalabrutinib is soluble in aqueous acidic conditions. Acalabrutinib is a BCS class 2 compound with BCS 
class 1 like behaviour in vivo under normal stomach pH conditions with rapid and complete dissolution. 
During the course of the development programme two different immediate release capsule 
formulations were produced. 
The development of acalabrutinib capsules for use in pivotal clinical studies and for commercial supply, 
was focused on the identification of a more suitable formulation. The compatibility of acalabrutinib was 
evaluated with a range of commonly used excipients for the development of solid oral dosage forms, 
including diluents, binders, disintegrants, lubricants, glidants and surfactants. The knowledge gained 
through excipient compatibility studies was key in defining the composition of both clinical and 
commercial acalabrutinib capsule formulations. The robustness of the proposed commercial capsules 
formulation to changes in excipient suppliers/grades and active substance particle size has been 
studied. These studies demonstrate the robustness of the acalabrutinib capsules formulation to 
variation in input materials. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality 
is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product 
formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this 
report. 
Comparison of pharmacokinetic parameters for the two formulations was conducted in healthy 
volunteers and indicates that exposure is similar between the formulations.

The dissolution method consists of the paddle apparatus, considered the most biorelevant pH since 
dissolution occurs in the stomach. The discriminatory power of the method was investigated. The 
method is deemed sufficiently discriminatory. 
A range of development batches ranging from pilot to production scale were manufactured in order to 
investigate ranges of different parameters associated with the different process unit operations 
(blending, roller compaction, lubrication and encapsulation). These studies allowed optimisation of the 
various parameters although all batches manufactured complied with the release specification. 
Robustness was studied by deliberately varying certain parameters and material attributes from their 
set-points with no significant impact on product quality. 
The primary packaging is aluminium/aluminium blisters. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC 
requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of 4 main steps: blending of dry ingredients and lubrication; roller 
compaction and further lubrication; encapsulation; packaging. The process is considered to be a standard 
manufacturing process. 
The manufacturing process has been validated at the proposed lower scale on 3 consecutive batches of 
finished product. A validation protocol has been provided to document prospective validation at the 
higher scale. The developmental robustness studies and process validation data provided to date 
demonstrate that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing 
process and pharmaceutical form. In addition, the applicant will apply a continued process verification 
approach to monitoring the manufacturing process and further ensure the quality of the finished 
product throughout its lifecycle. 
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form: 
description, identification (UV, HPLC), assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), dissolution (Ph. Eur.), 
uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.) and microbiological quality (Ph. Eur.). 
The specified degradation products are also impurities carried over from the active substance process. 
The wider shelf-life limits have been justified by extrapolation from the stability studies. 
No routine test for microbiological quality is deemed necessary due to the low water activity of the 
active substance and based on data collected during stability studies indicating that microbial growth is 
not supported. Enantiomeric purity and polymorphic form were both monitored during stability studies 
indicating that these parameters are stable and do not need to be tested at release.  
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product was assessed using a risk-based 
approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities and no significant risk was 
identified. Batch analysis data on 3 batches using a validated ICP-MS method was provided, 
demonstrating that each relevant elemental impurity was well below 30% of the respective PDE. Based 
on the risk assessment and the presented batch data, it was concluded that no controls for elemental 
impurities are needed. 
The applicant submitted a risk evaluation on the potential presence of nitrosamines in Calquence. Both 
active substance and finished product manufacturing processes were considered, along with raw

materials and packaging. The analysis was deemed acceptable and no specific test or control measures 
for nitrosamine impurities are deemed necessary. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for several pilot to production batches confirming the consistency of 
the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 3 production scale batches of finished product stored for up to 36 months under long 
term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH), 36 months under intermediate conditions (30 ºC / 75% RH),  and for 
up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were 
provided. The batches of Calquence are representative of those proposed for marketing and were packed 
in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. The only differences were small changes in the extra-
capsular image. In addition, more data from 3 pilot scale batches with the final commercial image was 
provided. 
Samples  were  tested  for  appearance,  assay,  degradation  products,  dissolution,  water  content  and 
microbiological  quality.  The  analytical  procedures  used  are  stability  indicating.  There  were  small  but 
observable increases in the specified impurities over time, more so at elevated temperature, which justify 
the wider shelf-life limits. No significant changes to any other measured parameters were observed. 
In addition, 1 batch was  exposed to light as defined in the ICH  Guideline on  Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. Calquence is photostable. 
An open dish study was conducted to assess the of humidity on the capsules. Samples were stored under 
intermediate conditions for a month without an increase in impurities. The only change was an increase 
in water content which had no impact on the product quality. 
Finally, a study was conducted to justify bulk storage for up to 2 years in aluminium foil bags. Data from 
production  scale  batches  stored  for  up  to  2  years  under  long  term,  intermediate  and  accelerated 
conditions support the proposed bulk shelf-life.  
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months in the blister pack without 
special storage conditions as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
Gelatine obtained from bovine sources is used in the product. Valid TSE CEPs from the suppliers of the 
gelatine used in the manufacture were provided. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. The major objections 
Assessment report

relating to the choice of starting materials and the nitrosamines risk assessment have been adequately 
resolved. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety.

Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The pharmacokinetics and metabolism of acalabrutinib were studied in mouse, rat, dog, monkey, and 
human tissues in vitro and in mouse, rat, dog, monkey and human in vivo. The species and strains 
used were the same as those used in pharmacology and toxicology studies except for a rat quantitative 
whole-body autoradiography (QWBA) study, which used a partially pigmented strain. The nonclinical 
toxicology profile of acalabrutinib (ACP-196) has been evaluated in mice, rats, rabbits, and dogs in 
agreement with relevant guidelines. A number of process intermediates/impurities have been studied. 
The pivotal studies were conducted in compliance with GLP.

Potency of Acalabrutinib, Ibrutinib, Ibrutinib M37, and Spebrutinib on BTK using IMAP Assay Platform 
Acalabrutinib, ibrutinib and its active major metabolite M37, and spebrutinib were evaluated using 
multiple platforms to assess the potency and target binding mechanism.  BTK potency was evaluated 
for acalabrutinib and its main metabolite ACP-5862 (M27). BTK enzymatic activity was measured using 
an immobilized metal ion affinity-based fluorescence polarization (IMAP) assay.

Broad Kinome Selectivity of Acalabrutinib and ACP-5862 
A wider kinome screen was performed for acalabrutinib, ibrutinib, and their major metabolites in 
commercial kinase panels at ThermoFisher (282 mammalian kinases) and DiscoveRx (384 or 392 
wild-type mammalian kinases). The ThermoFisher profiling was conducted as a high-dose (10 µM) 
screen, using Z’-LYTE™, LanthaScreen, or Adapta assay technology.   
To further investigate the kinase selectivity of acalabrutinib and ACP-5862, IC50 values were 
generated on 32 kinases identified from the initial screen, using ≥70% inhibition at 10 µM as 
selection criteria (and excluding the 3F-Cys kinases).  
Results for all kinases with IC50 values of less than 1 µM for either acalabrutinib or ACP-5862 are:

Selectivity versus SRC Family Kinases 
Some Src family of proto-oncogene nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases showed potent inhibition with 
ibrutinib in both the ThermoFisher and DiscoveRx scans. As Src-family kinases are broadly expressed 
and important for many functions in cells of hematopoietic origin, the BTK inhibitors and ibrutinib M37 
were tested in kinase inhibition assays with human members of the Src family

In vivo studies 
Single-Dose Activity in Mice: Dose-Response Comparison with Ibrutinib 
In vivo potency of BTK inhibition was tested in ex-vivo assays of B-cell function. Mice (5 per group) 
were gavaged with acalabrutinib, ibrutinib, spebrutinib, or vehicle over a concentration range. After 3 
hours, spleens were extracted and splenocytes stimulated with anti-IgM for 18 hours. Expression levels 
of the B-cell activation marker CD69 were measured in gated B cells by flow cytometry.

Evaluation of Efficacy of Acalabrutinib and Ibrutinib in Mouse Xenograft Models of DLBCL and MCL 
Acalabrutinib was evaluated in human xenograft models of MCL and DLBCL in mice to demonstrate 
antitumor activity in vivo. OCI-Ly10 human DLBCL or Jeko-1 human MCL cells (5 x 106/mouse) were 
implanted subcutaneously in female CB.17 SCID mice. Acalabrutinib was dosed at 12.5 mg/kg BID and 
ibrutinib was dosed at 12 mg/kg QD.

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Evaluation of the secondary pharmacology for acalabrutinib and ACP-5862 was performed using two 
radioligand binding assays across a diverse set of 80 receptors, ion channels, and transporters. No 
acalabrutinib activity of ≥50% was detected on 79 of the 80 tested targets.  Interaction (was detected 
only on adenosine A3 receptor (A3), with a Ki value of 2.7 µM in the first assay and 0.91 µM in the 
second assay. Acalabrutinib showed some inhibition on adenosine 2A (A2A, 35.1% inhibition, Ki=17 
µM). 
The pharmacology interaction profile of the major metabolite ACP-5862 was comparable to that 
observed with acalabrutinib. No interaction was observed at 77 of the 80 receptors tested. Inhibition of 
specific ligand binding of ≥50% was identified for A2A, A3, and neurokinin 2 (NK2) in the 10 µM 
screen. The Ki values for ACP-5862 were determined to be 12 µM for A2A, 4.8 µM for A3 and 5.8 µM 
for NK2. 
The acalabrutinib unbound Cmax in patients at the intended therapeutic dose was 27-fold lower than the 
Ki for the A3 receptor. The ACP-5862 unbound Cmax in patients at the intended therapeutic dose was 
321-fold lower than the Ki for the A3 receptor.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
CNS  
Modified Irwin test in rats, Study 503222, GLP 
The potential effects of acalabrutinib on neurobehavior (modified Irwin’s test) and on body 
temperature were assessed after a single oral administration to male Sprague-Dawley rats.  Animals (8 
per group) were dosed once by oral gavage with vehicle, 30, 100, or 300 mg/kg acalabrutinib or with 
20 mg/kg chlorpromazine as reference substance. Animals were evaluated at predose and 1, 2, 4, 6, 
and 24 hours after dosing. Single oral administration of acalabrutinib at doses up to 300 mg/kg did not 
elicit any neurobehavioral effects, or effects on rectal temperature. 
Cardiovascular 
Effect on hERG channel, Study 503219, GLP 
The in vitro effect of acalabrutinib on hERG channel activity was investigated in human embryonic 
kidney (HEK) cells stably transfected with hERG.  The effect of acalabrutinib at 10 μM on the hERG tail 
current was measured in 5 cells. Acalabrutinib at a concentration of 10 μM showed an inhibition of 
25.1±1.3% of the hERG tail current 
Effect on hERG channel, Study 794950, GLP 
The potential of acalabrutinib alone and in combination with ACP-319, a selective PI3Kδ inhibitor, to 
cause inhibition at the hERG channel was investigated using the whole-cell patch clamp 
electrophysiology technique in CHO-K1 (Chinese Hamster Ovary) cells stably transfected with hERG. 
Acalabrutinib at 1 µM and 10 µM inhibited the hERG tail current by 8.2 ± 3.7% and 24.9 ± 6.9%, 
respectively. 
Single dose cardiovascular telemetry study in beagle dogs, Study 491868, non-GLP 
This was a pilot study conducted before selection of acalabrutinib for development. The results showed 
that oral administration of acalabrutinib at doses of 10 and 30 mg/kg did not result in changes in the 
ECG parameters, heart rate, and mean arterial blood pressure up to 24 hours after administration in 
radiotelemetry-implanted male beagle dogs. 
Cardiovascular Effects of ACP-196 after Oral Administration to Dogs, Study 594019, GLP 
A single oral gavage dose of 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg acalabrutinib did not significantly affect the

cardiovascular system, body temperature, ECG intervals, or physical condition of the animals. Mean 
total blood concentrations of 188, 679, and 3442 ng/mL acalabrutinib were noted at 3 hours 
postdosing after administration of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg, respectively. 
Respiratory 
Effects on Respiration by Means of Head-Out Plethysmography in male Sprague-Dawley Rats, Study 
503221, GLP 
There were no statistically significant changes in any respiratory parameters in acalabrutinib-treated 
groups at 0 (vehicle), 30, 100, and 300 mg/kg when compared with the vehicle control group at each 
time interval.

Protein binding 
The plasma protein binding characteristics of acalabrutinib were investigated in several studies using 
ultrafiltration, equilibrium dialysis, and ultracentrifugation methodologies. The ultracentrifugation 
technique was superior and used to determine plasma protein binding.

Quantitative Whole-Body Autoradiography in SD Rats, Study ESN0329 
Following the administration of single oral doses of [14C]acalabrutinib, radioactivity (representing 
acalabrutinib and/or its metabolites) was rapidly absorbed and widely distributed into tissues with 
maximum concentrations of radioactivity in almost all tissues being measured at 0.25 or 1 hour after 
dosing. During 0.25– 24 h after dosing the distribution pattern of radioactivity at each time point was 
similar with most tissues containing radioactivity concentrations, similar to or, less than that observed 
in whole blood. Greatest radioactivity concentrations were present in the small intestine wall (generally 
about 20-fold greater than in whole-blood), liver (approximately 6-fold greater than in whole-blood) 
and kidney (approximately 4-fold greater than in whole blood), adrenal gland, stomach wall, spleen, 
lacrimal glands and pancreas. Acalabrutinib and metabolite ACP
5862 were present in plasma of 
fetuses on GD 18 and were secreted into the milk of lactating rats.

Metabolism 
Metabolism of [14C]acalabrutinib was determined in vitro in hepatocytes from mouse, rat, dog, 
monkey, and human. Rat, dog, and human ADME of acalabrutinib was determined in definitive 
radiolabelled studies at doses of 100 mg/kg, 30 mg/kg, and 100 mg, respectively.

The primary metabolic pathways were characterized for acalabrutinib, with secondary and tertiary 
metabolites arising from sequential metabolism and/or combinations of the 3 major routes.

The most abundant circulating metabolite in human was ACP-5862 (M27), which was formed by 
CYP3A-mediated oxidation. No other quantitatively significant acalabrutinib metabolites were observed 
in human plasma. 
Metabolism of [14C]acalabrutinib has been evaluated in vivo in rat (100 mg/kg PO), dog (30 mg/kg 
PO), and human (100 mg PO) with characterization of metabolites in plasma, urine and faeces.  Over 3 
dozen metabolites were characterized in the plasma and excreta of rat, dog, and human following an 
oral dose of [14C]acalabrutinib.  
The metabolic fate of [14C]acalabrutinib was characterized in a formal mass balance study in human 
(ACE-HV-009).

↑BUN, CREA in 2 F at week 2. Not observed at later time points. 
And multiple statistically significant differences in K, CA, ALP, AST, ALT that were not considered 
relevant based on sporadic nature, lack of a dose response, small magnitude, lack of findings among 
other correlative endpoints.

Microscopic 
Pancreas: ≥30 mg/kg (M): haemorrhage/pigment/inflammation/fibrosis; varying presence and severity 
of lymphocytes and plasma cells that invaded the islets. Shrunken exocrine pancreatic cells with 
decreased secretory and apoptotic bodies (acinar atrophy) 
Kidney: ≥100 mg/kg (F) tubular degeneration/necrosis. Findings in the kidneys were most severe in in 
the animals that died preterm.  
Liver: DOS (F): individual hepatocyte degeneration/necrosis. Increased mitotic figures were present in 
4 of the 6 DOS females. Similar findings were noted in females at 100 mg/kg and in both sexes at 
300/200 mg/kg. 
Heart: In the heart of 10 out of 11 DOS females, there were multiple areas of myocardial loss of 
varying degrees, with replacement by a mixed inflammatory cell population and extravasated red blood 
cells.  
Mesenteric lymph node: erythrocytosis/erythrophagocytosis. Increased in incidence as the dose 
increased in males. Similar incidence and severity in F 
Lymphoid organ: 300/200 mg/kg (F): generalized lymphoid depletion in the thymus and/or spleen. 
Considered related to stress and the other related systemic findings 
Recovery: Findings were present in the pancreas of M and kidneys of F, but at lower incidence and 
lesser severity than in terminal animals. 
The microscopic lesions in the liver (individual hepatocyte degeneration/necrosis) in females at 100 
mg/kg/day and both sexes at 300/200 mg/kg/day and in the kidney (tubular degeneration/necrosis) at 
100 and 300/200 mg/kg/day (females only) were considered adverse. Therefore, the NOAEL is 100 
mg/kg/day ACP-196 in males and 30 mg/kg/day in females.

Outcome: Negative 
Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with acalabrutinib (see discussion on non-clinical 
aspects). 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Studies were conducted to evaluate the standard reproductive and developmental toxicity profile of 
acalabrutinib: one combined segment I ‘fertility’ and segment II ‘EFD’ study (Sprague-Dawley rats), 
one segment II ‘EFD’ study (New Zealand white rabbits), and one segment III ‘prenatal/postnatal 
study (Sprague Dawley rats).  
Male and female fertility 
Male and female fertility and early embryonic development were evaluated in rats after administration 
of acalabrutinib at 0, 30, 100, 300 (M)/200 (F) mg/kg/day. 
In males, the highest tested dose (300 mg/kg) was not tolerated. The findings in the animals that 
were found dead were similar as observed in the repeat dose toxicity studies and are considered 
related to acalabrutinib and adverse. However, no influence was noted on the fertility index and sperm 
parameters in the surviving animals or in the animals administered lower doses. The NOAEL for fertility 
suggested by the applicant, 300 mg/kg, is accepted. This corresponds to an exposure margin of 
19900/1893 = 10.5 times (based on AUC) when compared with the exposure observed in patients.  
In the female rats, acalabrutinib was administered at doses up to 200 mg/kg/day starting 14 days 
prior to mating through gestational day 17. No acalabrutinib related changes were noted on mating, 
fertility, and fecundity indices, mean number of implantation sites, viable foetuses, nonviable foetuses, 
litter size or resorption sites. A decreased cycle count (2.1 cycles vs 2.6 in controls) during the 
premating period in animals administered 100 and 200 mg/kg, and increased cycle length (5.0 days vs 
4.1 days in controls) in animals administered 100 mg/kg were observed. However, since these values 
were within historical control range and since no effects on fertility were observed, the findings were 
not considered test article related or adverse. The NOAEL for fertility parameters was 200 mg/kg. This 
dose level corresponds to 17500/1893 = 9.2 times the exposure observed in patients, based on AUC.

Embryo-foetal development 
Embryo-foetal development was investigated in rats and rabbits. Dose range finding studies were 
conducted in both species. The investigation in rats was conducted as a combination study including 
investigation of fertility parameters. 
In the female rats, acalabrutinib was administered at doses up to 200 mg/kg/day starting 14 days 
prior to mating through gestational day 17. A higher top dose (200 mg/kg/day) was selected for the 
pivotal fertility and embryo-foetal study than in the DRF study (100 mg/kg/day) since no test article 
related effects were observed in the DRF study. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity and embryo-foetal 
development was considered by the applicant to be 200 mg/kg. One female in the 200 mg/kg group 
was euthanised in extremis on GD19. The death was considered to be related to dystocia, and not 
considered by the applicant to be test article related. However, dystocia was also observed in the PPND 
study (see below) and should be considered related to the test article and adverse. The maternal 
NOAEL and NOAEL for embryo-foetal development and survival was thus lowered to 100 mg/kg. This 
dose level corresponds to 6830/1893 = 3.6 times the exposure observed in patients, based on AUC. 
In the embryo-foetal study in rabbits, pregnant animals were administered acalabrutinib at doses up to 
200 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis (GD6-18). The highest dose was not tolerated and 
several animals were found dead, which lead to the decision to terminate the whole group earlier. 
Maternal toxicity was also observed at 100 mg/kg/day, a dose that resulted in decreased foetal body 
weights and delayed skeletal ossification. The maternal and developmental NOAEL was set at 50 
mg/kg/day which corresponds to an exposure similar to what is seen in patients based on AUC (2030 
in animals vs 1893 in humans). 
Prenatal and postnatal development 
The potential effects of acalabrutinib on development, growth, behaviour, reproductive performance 
and fertility of F1 generation were evaluated in rats after administration of 0, 50, 100 and 150 
mg/kg/day to F0 females from gestation day 6 through day 20 post-partum. In the study, only F0 
dams were administered acalabrutinib. Dystocia (prolonged or difficult labor) and mortality of offspring 
were observed at doses ≥100 mg/kg/day. At the highest dose decreased liver weights were observed 
in the offspring.  
Dystocia and mortality of offspring were observed at exposures corresponding to 4470/1893 = 2.4 
times the exposure observed in patients. The exposure at NOAEL is at exposures lower than what is 
observed in patients (1420/1893 = 0.75).  
In a preceding pilot study, the concentrations of ACP-196 and the human metabolite ACP-5862 were 
measured in maternal milk and plasma and fetal and pup plasma. Both acalabrutinib and the active 
metabolite were measured in foetal plasma. Furthermore, both substances were observed in milk with 
higher concentrations in milk than plasma 3 h post dose, indicating that the pups were exposed also 
during lactation although the mean plasma concentrations in the pups 1 hour after the dose was less 
than 1% of what was observed in the dams.

Other toxicity studies 
Metabolites 
No specific studies were conducted with the acalabrutinib metabolite (ACP-5862). The exposure of the 
metabolite ACP-5862 was not measured in any of the pivotal toxicity studies.  
Impurities 
Several GLP nonclinical studies have been performed to qualify acalabrutinib process-related 
substances, impurities and degradation products. 
Process impurities/degradants ACP-5134, ACP-1049, ACP-5541, and ACP-2009 did not induce a 
mutagenic response in the bacterial reverse mutation assay. 
One process impurity of ACP-196, ACP-5187, induced a positive mutagenic response in the bacterial 
reverse mutation assay. ACP-5187 is controlled at a level of no more than 50 ppm, which corresponds 
to the Threshold of Toxicological Concern of 10 µg/day for drugs where the total expected duration of 
use is between 1 and 10 years. 
The process impurity ACP-2009 was investigated in the bacterial reverse mutation assay, in vitro 
mammalian chromosomal aberration test, and a 14-days repeat dose toxicity study in rats. ACP-2009 
was not tested as a pure substance but was present in ACP-196 (6.49% w/w) in all three studies. ACP-
2009 was found to be non-genotoxic. In the in vivo study in rat, the total daily intake of ACP-2009 was 
0.0649x25 mg/kg= 1.6 mg/kg. The conversion factor 0.16 could be used to convert the dose to a 
human equivalent dose based on body surface area: 1.6 mg/kgx0.16= 0.256 mg/kg, assuming a 60 kg 
human the daily intake of ACP-2009 would thus be 15.4 mg/day. ACP-2009 is controlled at a level of 
no more than 0.3%, with the maximum daily dose of 200 mg a human daily intake of ACP-2009 would 
be 0.3%x200 mg/day= 0.6 mg/day. The specification limit of 0.3% w/w could thus be considered 
supported by toxicological qualification. 
Phototoxicity 
The chemical structure of acalabrutinib contains a conjugated aromatic system with Molar extinction 
coefficient >1000 cm-1M-1 between 290 and 700 nM. Peak maxima were observed at approximately 
197, 230, and 283 nm. In vitro phototoxicity screens were performed with mouse fibroblasts (3T3 
cells) to determine the relative cytotoxicity of acalabrutinib with or without of UVA radiation. In 
addition, an Ames test was conducted with UV activation of acalabrutinib to evaluate photo-activation 
of mutagenic potential. 
Acalabrutinib absorbs light within the range of natural sunlight, with molar extinction coefficient >1000 
cm-1M-1 between 290 and 700 nM. In other words, acalabrutinib has a photoreactive potential. 
Testing for photogenotoxicity is not recommended as a part of the standard photosafety testing 
program. Acalabrutinib was however investigated for photogenotoxicity in a bacterial reverse mutation 
assay and found not mutagenic in the S. typhimurium reverse mutation assay under the influence of 
UV irradiation (315-690 nm). 
Acalabrutinib was positive in the 3T3 neutral red uptake assay. The EC50 was 32.7 µg/mL which is 
higher than the observed clinical Cmax= 466 ng/mL.  
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In the Phase I exposure assessment, the PECSURFACEWATER for acalabrutinib 0.048 µg/L exceeded the 
action limit of 0.01 µg/L. Therefore, a Phase II Tier A assessment was triggered. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/458179/2020  
Page 42/147 
 
 
 
The Log Dow was <2 at relevant pH values and acalabrutinib was thus not considered a PBT substance 
in the screening for persistence, bioaccumulation, and toxicity (PBT). Acalabrutinib is however very 
persistent in sediment according to the OECD 308 study.  
The organic content solid adsorption coefficient for acalabrutinib was below 10000 L/kg for sludge, not 
triggering the Tier B for the terrestrial compartment. Acalabrutinib was primarily partitioned to the 
sediment layers. A Phase II Tier B extended effects on the sediment compartment was therefore 
triggered. 
Based on the Phase I PECSW, the applicant has provided a set risk quotients/ratios that are below 0.1 
for sludge micro-organisms and below 1 for other compartments. 
Acalabrutinib is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Acalabrutinib is a highly selective inhibitor of BTK. The pharmacological relevance of the toxicology 
species was established in animal models where BTK inhibition is at play. 
In the rat, acalabrutinib showed activity in the adjuvant arthritis model. In this study it was 
demonstrated that therapeutic doses were associated with complete BTK occupancy. In the dog, a 
veterinary study showed anti-tumour effect in dogs with spontaneous B-cell lymphoma. Complete BTK 
occupancy was demonstrated in both species.   
No effects were reported on CNS and respiratory system. For the cardiovascular system, an inhibition 
of the hERG current tail has been described and significant findings have been reported in in vivo 
studies (QTc changes in in vivo study 2219-015; changes in relevant parameters in cardiovascular 
study 594019; and heart findings in repeat dose toxicity studies and atrial fibrillation/flutter in 
humans; actions of other BTK inhibitors on PI3K/Akt pathway and its role as a critical regulator of 
cardiac tissues) (see SmPC section 4.4).  
The non-clinical pharmacokinetics for acalabrutinib was adequately evaluated. Of importance for the 
safety assessment, a distribution study in the pigmented rat demonstrated binding to melanin leading 
to retention in skin and eye, which led to a need for investigation of the phototoxic potential.  
In a human mass balance study, ACP-5862 was identified as the only metabolite that accounted for 
>10% of total acalabrutinib-related radioactivity in human plasma. Due to late identification of this 
main metabolite, exposure to the metabolite was not addressed in pivotal toxicity studies. Based on 
data from mass balance studies it is concluded that the metabolite is present in both species. In rat, 
exposure ratio metabolite / parent is higher than in humans. In dogs the ratio is lower than in humans, 
resulting in approximately the same exposure at the high dose in the repeat dose toxicity studies and 
clinical exposure. It is considered that the main metabolite is adequately qualified in the toxicology 
program with rat and dog. No information is provided on in vivo metabolism in rabbit, a species used 
for the evaluation of embryofetal toxicity. However, the main metabolite ACP-5862 was formed in vitro 
with rabbit hepatocytes, and it is likely that it is present in vivo.

Acalabrutinib was not tolerated in rats and dogs at high doses. Acute kidney failure and/or myocardial 
haemorrhage/inflammation/necrosis were considered the cause of death. The mechanism that would 
lead to these conditions is not understood.  
In rats, microscopic findings of minimal to mild severity were observed in the pancreas 
(haemorrhage/pigment/inflammation/ fibrosis in islets) at all dose levels. Non-adverse findings of 
minimal to mild severity in the kidneys (tubular basophilia, tubular regeneration, and inflammation) 
were observed in studies of up to 6-month duration with a No Observed Adverse Effect level (NOAEL) 
of 30 mg/kg/day in rats. The mean exposures (AUC) at the NOAEL in male and female rats correspond 
to 0.6x and 1x, respectively, the clinical exposure at the recommended dose of 100 mg twice daily, 
respectively. The Lowest Adverse Observed Effect Level (LOAEL) at which reversible renal (moderate 
tubular degeneration) and liver (individual hepatocyte necrosis) findings were observed in the chronic 
rat study was 100 mg/kg/day and provided an exposure margin 4.2 times greater than the clinical 
exposure at the recommended dose of 100 mg twice daily. In studies of 9 months duration in dogs, the 
NOAEL was 10 mg/kg/day corresponding to an exposure 3x the clinical AUC at the recommended 
clinical dose. Minimal tubular degeneration in kidney, slight decreases in spleen weights and transient 
minimal to mild decreases in red cell mass and increases in ALT and ALP were observed at 30 
mg/kg/day (9x the clinical AUC) in dogs.  
Although the pancreatic findings are considered of low clinical relevance to humans, the findings are 
considered adverse and are included in the SmPC section 5.3.    
Cardiac toxicities in rats (myocardial haemorrhage, inflammation, necrosis) and dogs 
(perivascular/vascular inflammation) were observed only in animals that died during studies at doses 
above the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The exposures in rats and dogs with cardiac findings was at 
least 6.8 times and 25 times the clinical AUC, respectively. Reversibility for the heart findings could not 
be assessed as these findings were only observed at doses above the MTD (see SmPC section 5.3). 
Cardiac function was also monitored in the clinical studies (see discussion on Clinical Safety).  
In the repeated dose toxicity studies in dog, findings such as haematology findings, increased ALT and 
ALP, and lower spleen weights were observed in acalabrutinib-treated animals. (See also Clinical safety 
discussion and the RMP).  
No effects on fertility were observed in male or female rats at exposures 10 or 9 times the clinical AUC 
at the recommended dose, respectively. No effects on embryofoetal development and survival were 
observed in pregnant rats, at exposures approximately 9 times the AUC in patients at the 
recommended dose of 100 mg twice daily. In two rat reproductive studies, dystocia (prolonged/difficult 
labour) was observed at exposures >2.3 times the clinical exposure at 100mg twice daily. The 
presence of acalabrutinib and its active metabolite were confirmed in foetal rat plasma. Acalabrutinib 
and its active metabolite were present in the milk of lactating rats. Recommendation to not breast-feed 
during treatment and for 2 days after the last dose is included under SmPC section 4.6.  
In an embryofoetal study in pregnant rabbits, decreased foetal body weight and delayed ossification 
were observed at exposure levels that produced maternal toxicity which were 2.4 times greater than 
the human AUC at the recommended dose.  
Acalabrutinib was not genotoxic in the conducted genotoxicity studies. The genotoxic potential of the 
human major metabolite ACP-5862 was not specifically addressed. However, the in vitro genotoxicity 
studies contained rat S9 mix, and the in vivo genotoxicity study was conducted in rat. It is not known 
at what levels the metabolite ACP-5862 could be found in the in vitro set up with S9. However, in in 
vitro studies with human microsomes ACP-5862 is formed. Furthermore the metabolite is found in vivo 
in rats and presumably also formed by rat S9 in vitro. The metabolite ACP-5862 can be considered 
non-genotoxic.

Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with acalabrutinib. Second primary malignancies 
(SPM) have been detected in acalabrutinb patients (see discussion on clinical safety) and can be 
considered treatment related. It is agreed that rodent carcinogenicity studies investigating 
acalabrutinib would be of limited value and is not required. The existing literature indicates that both 
the inherent risk in the disease itself and the B-cell role in both promoting and inhibiting cancer 
progression could be involved in the mechanism.   
Acalabrutinib is not recommended to be used during pregnancy (see SmPC section 4.6). In the most 
sensitive species, the rabbit, decreased foetal body weights and delayed skeletal ossification were 
observed at similar exposure levels as in human patients. Due to maternal toxicity, it was not possible 
to increase the exposure in the rabbits further. In the rat PPND study, dystocia and mortality of the 
offspring was noted at doses corresponding to 2.4 times the exposure observed in patients. No further 
discussions on the mechanistic aspects were provided.   
No local tolerance studies have been conducted. Acalabrutinib will be administered via the oral route. 
There are no findings from the repeat-dose toxicity studies that are indicative of low local tolerance. 
The lack of separate local tolerance studies is acceptable. 
Immunotoxicity of acalabrutinib has not been assessed although BTK is known to play a relevant role 
in B-cell activation and immunological endpoints were reported in repeated dose toxicity studies. The 
observed effects are described to be partially or completely reversed during the recovery period. In the 
clinical trials, no changes in serum IgM and IgG were reported. 
No specific studies were conducted with the human major metabolite (ACP-5862). Characterization of 
ACP-5862 following a single oral dose has been conducted. The applicant refers to data suggesting that 
the main human metabolite is formed by rabbit hepatocytes in vitro. It is agreed that rabbits were 
most likely exposed to ACP-5862 in the embryo foetal toxicity study; data indicates adequate exposure 
of the metabolite in the toxicological studies. 
Both degradation impurities in the final product: ACP-1049 and ACP-5134 were found negative in the 
bacterial reverse mutation assay. ACP-1049 and ACP-5134 were present in the 13 weeks repeat dose 
toxicity study in rats. NOAEL was not established in the study, but the highest tested dose was 100 
mg/kg/day. The level of the impurities was 0.21 and 0.12 %, and thus administered at 0.21 and 0.12 
mg/kg/day. These levels would represent 5.3 and 3.0%, if transformed to a 200 mg dose per day in a 
50 kg person. Levels which are 8 and 5 times the proposed specification limit (0.6 %), which were 
margins that were previously unclear. ACP-5541 was present in the 26 weeks repeat dose toxicity 
study in rats. The NOAEL was not established in male rats. The qualification level was calculated at 100 
mg/kg, which is accepted. ACP- 5812 was present in the designated impurity repeat dose study in rats. 
The applicant justified the proposed dose-free period by claiming at least 5 half-lives for acalabrutinib 
and the metabolite ACP-5862. The recommendation of 2 days is endorsed.  
Acalabrutinib was positive in the 3T3 neutral red uptake assay. The applicant claims that the 
concentration that caused the positive reaction (32.7 µg/mL) is well above the clinical Cmax (0.47 
µg/mL). Currently, a phototoxic potential of acalabrutinib is possible, but due to lack of further 
phototoxicity testing, the clinical relevance of the 3T3 data is not possible to adequately assess. It is 
agreed that UVB -induced phototoxicity rarely is a problem for pharmaceuticals with systemic exposure 
due to the limited penetration beyond epidermis. However, acalabrutinib is shown to bind to melanin 
which is formed in the basal layer of the epidermis, there is a concern for a possible potential 
phototoxicity of acalabrutinib. In SmPC section 4.4 advice on protection from sun exposure is included. 
The applicant was also asked to complete the information about potential phototoxicity by performing 
an in vitro GLP 3T3 phototoxicity study. The results will be reported post authorization, by Q2 2021 as 
recommended by the CHMP.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Methods 
Plasma and urine concentrations of acalabrutinib and plasma concentrations of its metabolite ACP-5862 
were determined with LC-MS/MS methods. Standard non-compartment analysis was performed in all 
studies where rich sampling was applied. 
PBPK modelling and simulations using Simcyp were undertaken to predict the DDI potential between 
acalabrutinib and CYP3A modulators, including effect on the active metabolite ACP-5862, and to assess 
the inhibition potential of acalabrutinib and ACP-5862 on CYP3A4 or CYP2C8 substrates.   
A population PK analysis was undertaken to characterize the pharmacokinetics of acalabrutinib and 
ACP-5862 in healthy subjects and subjects with B-cell malignancies including CLL and identify 
covariate effects on the PK parameters; estimate acalabrutinib/ACP-5862 individual empirical Bayes 
estimates and exposures to enable subsequent exposure-efficacy and exposure-safety analyses in 
subjects with B-cell malignancies. 
Data from 12 clinical studies were integrated in the population PK analysis: 5 Phase 1 studies in 
healthy subjects (ACE-HV-001, -004, -112, and -113) and 8 Phase 1b/2/3 studies in subjects with B-

cell malignancies (ACE-CL-001, -CL-003, -CL-007, ACE-LY-002, -003, -004, -MY-001, and -WM-001).  
The pooled analysis dataset comprised acalabrutinib and ACP-5862 plasma concentrations (metabolite 
measurements were not available across all clinical studies) and relevant covariates from 138 healthy 
subjects and 575 subjects with B cell malignancies. 
Acalabrutinib concentration-time data was best characterized by a 2-compartment structural model 
with transit chain absorption (5 transit compartments and first-order absorption) and linear 
elimination. The model was parameterized in terms of MTT, Ka, CL/F, Vc/F, apparent inter-
compartmental clearance (Q/F), and Vp/F. Between occasion variability (BOV) was included on MTT 
and F1 and between subject variability (BSV) was estimated for CL/F, Vc/F and Vp/F. The estimated 
population means of CL/F, Vc/F, Q/F, Vp/F, MTT and Ka were: 133.7 L/h, 30.95 L, 20.93 L/h, 109.5 L, 
0.4587 hours, and 1.478 hours-1, respectively. BSV in CL/F, Vc/F and Vp/F were 24 (% coefficient of 
variation [CV]), 270(%CV) and 34 (%CV), respectively. BOV in MTT and F1 were 118 (%CV) and 
56(%CV), respectively.  
ACP-5862 concentration-time data was best characterized by a 2-compartment structural model with a 
first-order production rate of 0.4*CL/F and linear elimination. The model was parameterized in terms 
of apparent clearance (CLM/F), apparent volume of central compartment (VcM/F), apparent 
intercompartmental clearance (QM/F), and apparent volume of peripheral compartment (VpM/F). BSV 
was estimated for all four parameters. The estimated population means of CLM/F, VcM/F, QM/F, and 
VpM/F were: 21.7 L/h, 22.6 L, 26.7 L/h, and 89.2 L, respectively. BSV in CLM/F, VcM/F, QM/F, and 
VpM/F were 12 (%CV), 47 (%CV), 41 (%CV), and 19 (%CV), respectively.  
Proton-pump inhibitors (PPI) were included as covariates on F1. The baseline ECOG score and health 
status were included as covariates on CL/F. In addition, health status was included as covariate on 
Vp/F. 
Absorption  
The absolute bioavailability of acalabrutinib following a single 100 mg oral dose was 25.3% (range 
20.7% to 31.3% in individual subjects) (study ACE-HV-009). 
The absorption of acalabrutinib is rapid with maximum plasma concentrations occurring generally 
between 0.5 and 1.5 hours after single and repeated doses. 
Based on the aqueous solubility across the physiological pH range, acalabrutinib has low solubility, but 
the solubility is high in acidic conditions up to pH 4 (e.g., normal gastric pH). 
•  Bioequivalence 
No bioequivalence study has been performed. An initial “blend in capsule” formulation was used in 
early clinical studies and initial stages of pivotal studies, but the commercially representative “capsule” 
formulation was used in the pivotal phase 3 studies.  
• 
Food interaction 
The effect of food on the initial “blend in capsule” formulation was investigated in study ACE-HV-001. 
There was a significant decrease in Cmax (69% decrease) and a delay in tmax from 0.5 to 2.5 hours 
when the product was taken with a high-fat meal compared to the fasted state, while there was no 
significant effect on AUC (results slightly outside BE acceptance criteria).

•  Effect of gastric pH 
Acalabrutinib is a weakly basic drug that exhibits 2 basic moieties (pKa=3.5 and 5.8) and one acidic 
moiety at pKa 12.1.  Its solubility is pH-dependent across the physiological pH range.  Based on a dose 
of 100 mg, acalabrutinib can be described as highly soluble in aqueous media at pH 4 and below but 
with low solubility above pH 4. Thus, acalabrutinib is soluble in the stomach, and in vivo absorption is 
decreased by substances that increase gastric pH (such as PPIs, H2-receptorantagonists and antacids), 
(see also section on Drug – drug interactions).  
Helicobacter pylori infection 
The healthy subject study population was enriched in Hispanic subjects, a population known to have an 
increased incidence of H. pylori infection, which might influence the PK of drugs that have pH-
dependent dissolution. Therefore, the H. pylori status in healthy subjects was tested in several healthy 
volunteer studies. There was no consistent effect of H. pylori infection on acalabrutinib exposure. 
Distribution  
The volume of distribution (Vz) of acalabrutinib was 98.0 L (42.8%) (geometric mean [CV%]), and the 
volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) was 34.2 L (40.2%) after an IV microtracer dose (<10 µg; 
≤1 µCi) of [14C]acalabrutinib (Study ACE-HV-009). The Vz/F was 344 L (36.2%) (geometric mean 
[CV%]), after the oral acalabrutinib dose coadministered with the 14C-labeled IV tracer dose in Study 
ACE-HV-009. 
Plasma protein binding has been evaluated for acalabrutinib and its metabolite ACP-5862 with 
ultracentrifugation using low-binding polycarbonate tubes. The fraction unbound was 2.5% for 
acalabrutinib and 1.4% for ACP-5862. 
The in vitro mean blood-to-plasma ratio was 0.8 for acalabrutinib and 0.7 for the metabolite ACP-5862. 
In the mass balance study, the blood/plasma ratio of total radioactivity was 0.86 based on AUC0-12 h, 
and increased over time, likely due to covalent binding to BTK in blood cells. 
Elimination 
The main route of elimination for acalabrutinib is metabolism followed by excretion in faeces.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/458179/2020  
Page 50/147 
 
 
 
 
Based on study ACE-HV-009 (cohort 1, IV tracer dose), total CL and CLr for acalabrutinib (geometric 
mean [CV%]) was 39.4 L/h (30.6%) and 0.654 L/h (55.6%), respectively. The apparent clearance 
(CL/F) after the oral administration of 100-mg (capsule) acalabrutinib was 163 L/h (CV 35.7%), and 
CLR was 1.33 L/h (CV 32.8%).  
The terminal t1/2 of acalabrutinib (geometric mean [CV%]) was similar between oral and IV doses, 1.57 
(0.60%) hours for oral administration and 1.78 (0.46%) hours for IV administration (Cohort 1; Study 
ACE HV 009), ie approximately 1-2 hours. After single or repeated oral 100-mg acalabrutinib doses the 
mean terminal t1/2 of acalabrutinib ranged from 0.965 hour to 2.64 hours in healthy subjects. 
•  Mass balance 
Cohort 2 of study ACE-HV-009 was a single-dose mass balance study conducted in 6 healthy 
volunteers (4 male and 2 female) in the fasted state. Each subject received a single oral 100 mg dose 
of acalabrutinib (1 mg/ml oral solution) containing a microtracer (<10 µg, ≤1 µCi [14C]acalabrutinib). 
The majority of the total radioactivity was eliminated in the faeces, with geometric mean (CV%) 
recoveries of total radioactivity in urine and faeces of 12.0% (15.9%) and 83.5% (5.1%), respectively.  
Less than 1% (0.5%) of the dose was excreted as unchanged acalabrutinib in urine. Acalabrutinib 
accounted for 1.2% of the excreted dose in faeces.

•  Metabolism 
CYP3A-mediated oxidation is the major route of metabolism in humans. Glutathione conjugation and 
amide hydrolysis are minor metabolism pathways. In vitro reaction phenotyping data indicated 
conjugation of acalabrutinib with GSH is mediated primarily by human glutathione transferases M1 and 
M2 (GSTM1, GSTM2).  
In vitro data shows that the formation of the major metabolite ACP-5862 from acalabrutinib are 
mediated by CYP3A4. Also the metabolism of the metabolite ACP-5862 appears to be mediated by 
CYP3A4. 
Acalabrutinib was extensively metabolised following an oral dose of 14C-acalabrutinib, with 15 
metabolites identified in plasma, urine and faeces. In plasma, parent acalabrutinib accounted for 8.6% 
of total radioactivity and the most abundant metabolite was M27 (ACP-5862), representing 34.7% of 
total radioactivity. M27 was the only single human metabolite representing >10% of radioactivity and 
was about 4-fold the amount of parent acalabrutinib. The next most abundant plasma metabolite 
components after M27 were 10.8% (M7, M8, M9, M10, and M11, collectively) of radioactivity in the 
plasma profile. In urine, parent acalabrutinib accounted for 0.5% of excreted dose. The most abundant 
metabolite component co-eluted and was 2.7% of excreted dose, representing mainly M7, M10, and 
M11, collectively. Metabolite M27 (ACP-5862) represented 0.5% of excreted dose. In faeces, parent 
acalabrutinib accounted for 1.2% of excreted dose. The most abundant metabolite component co-
eluted and was 12.1% of excreted dose, representing M22, M45, and M23, collectively.

The mean acalabrutinib (ACP-196) to total 14C radioactivity ratio was 0.0635 for AUC0-∞ indicating that 
acalabrutinib contributed only a small proportion of total 14C radioactivity exposure with the majority of 
total 14C radioactivity arising from metabolites. 
The mean terminal t1/2 of total radioactivity in plasma was 46.5 hours while the half-life for parent drug 
was 1.47 hours. The t1/2 value for total radioactivity in whole blood was >2 times the sampling interval 
in 5 of the 6 subjects in Cohort 2, and mean half-life was not calculated. See Figure 12.

conversion. 
• 
Pharmacokinetics of metabolites 
A longer t1/2 and higher AUC or AUC0-last for the metabolite were observed relative to parent drug, with 
no meaningful accumulation of ACP-5862 after repeated BID dosing. In this study, the metabolite 
exposure increased roughly proportional to the increase in dose from 100 to 400 mg (while parent 
drug increased more than dose-proportional), the metabolite to parent (M/P) ratio of AUC values were 
2.36 following a single dose of 100-mg acalabrutinib and the half-life was similar for metabolite as for 
parent (2.54 hours for metabolite and 2.64 hours for parent drug after the 100-mg dose). In study 
ACE-CL-001 the half-life for the metabolite was around 2 hours, compared to around 1 hour for the 
parent drug. In study ACE- ACE-HV-113, the half-life was clearly longer for parent than for metabolite 
(6.8 hours vs 1.9 hours), the M/P ratio of AUC was 2.69 and tmax was 1 hour.

Dose-proportionality and time dependency 
In study ACE-HV-001, increases in AUC relative to the increases in dose administered were linear 
between 2.5 mg and 100 mg while the increase in mean Cmax values was greater than dose 
proportional over the studied dose range. In study ACE-HV-005, the increase in AUCs was greater than 
proportional between 100 mg and 400 mg in healthy subjects, where mean plasma acalabrutinib AUC0-
last, and AUC0-inf were 5.9-, and 7-fold higher, respectively, after oral administration of 400 mg 
compared to 100 mg acalabrutinib. Cmax was closer to dose proportional, 3.6-fold higher after 400 mg 
compared to 100 mg. In study ACE-CL-001, there was a less than dose-proportional increase of AUC 
and Cmax with increasing dose in the interval 100 QD to 400 mg QD and a roughly proportional increase 
in AUC and Cmax in the interval 100 mg BID to 200 mg BID. 
A cross-study comparison of AUC0-last over the acalabrutinib dose range 2.5 mg to 400 mg from the 
noncompartmental analyses in healthy subjects is presented below. Over the dose range of 2.5 mg to 
400 mg, the increase of acalabrutinib exposure (AUC0-last) was slightly greater than dose-proportional 
(slope estimate of 1.18 based on power model analysis). Based on population PK modelling, 
acalabrutinib exposure increased proportional to dose over the dose range 75 mg to 250 mg.

Figure 14: Acalabrutinib AUC0-last versus Dose Levels in Healthy Subjects (Monotherapy) 
No accumulation of acalabrutinib is observed during repeated dosing, which is in line with expectations 
based on the short half-life (1-2 hours) and dosing interval. There is no sign of time-dependency in the 
PK of acalabrutinib. There are no signs of auto-induction of acalabrutinib clearance. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
In the population PK analysis, predicted median (90%PI) acalabrutinib AUC24h,ss and maximum 
plasma concentration at steady state (Cmax,ss) values for the reference population following 
acalabrutinib 100 mg BID (subject with B-malignancies, ECOG ≤1, without concomitant intake of PPIs) 
were 1668 (1094-2536) ng*h/mL and 461 (199.8-783.3) ng/mL. The popPK analysis detected a 
difference between healthy subjects and patients in acalabrutinib clearance (CL/F), where healthy 
subjects have slightly higher clearance. Furthermore ECOG 2+ status had a statistically significant 
effect on acalabrutinib clearance where patients with ECOG 2+ had slightly lower clearance. In terms 
of exposure this translates into that healthy subjects, acalabrutinib AUC24h,ss was 1135 (745.7–1732) 
ng*h/mL and Cmax,ss: 348.3 (165.3–578.9) ng*h/mL, which is a decrease by 32% and 24%, 
respectively. In subjects with B-cell malignancies and ECOG ≥2 acalabrutinib AUC24h,ss was 2012 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/458179/2020  
Page 56/147 
 
 
 
 
 
(1319-3056) ng*h/mL and Cmax,ss: 527.7 (214.5–909.3) ng*h/mL, which is an increase by 21% and 
14%, respectively. 
The model predicted ACP-5862 AUC24h,ss and Cmax,ss for the reference population at 100 mg BID 
were 4175 (3256-5430) ng*h/mL and 461.3 (263.7- 678.4) ng/mL, respectively. Health status did not 
translate into the same impact on exposures of ACP-5862. In healthy subjects, ACP-5862 AUC24h,ss 
was 4177(3255–5432) ng/mL*h and Cmax,ss: 491.7 (289.2– 710.1) ng/mL, which is a change of 0% 
and 7%, respectively. In subjects with B-cell malignancies and ECOG ≥2 AUC24h,ss was 4177 (3256-
5430) and Cmax,ss: 444.2 (251.7– 658.9), which is an decrease by 0% and 4%, respectively.  
Special populations 
•  Renal impairment 
A formal clinical study to investigate the impact of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of 
acalabrutinib/ACP-5862 has not been performed.  In Study ACE-HV-009 the renal excretion of 
acalabrutinib was negligible (<2% after both oral and IV administration). The mean recovery of total 
radioactivity in urine was 12.0% (range 10.3% to 14.7%); the majority of total radioactivity was 
excreted in faeces. Based on the population PK analysis, including data for acalabrutinib [ACP-5862] 
from 408 [185] subjects with mild renal impairment (eGFR 60 to <89 mL/min/1.73 m2), 109 [50] 
subjects with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to <59 mL/min/1.73 m2), and 2 [1] subjects with 
severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2) and 192 [68] subjects with normal renal 
function (≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2), there was a trend of slightly increasing acalabrutinib exposure with 
decreasing renal function but not in ACP-5862, however no statistically significant effect of renal 
function on clearance was detected. Subjects with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (end stage renal disease 
or on dialysis) were not included in the clinical trials. The applicant concludes that acalabrutinib can be 
administered to subjects with mild and moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥30 mL/min) without any 
dose adjustments. The effects of severe renal impairment (very limited data) or hemodialysis on the 
pharmacokinetics of acalabrutinib/ACP-5862 have not been studied. 
•  Hepatic impairment 
Two studies investigated the effect of impaired hepatic function: Study ACE-HI-001 (investigating the 
effect of mild and moderate HI on acalabrutinib exposure) and study ACE-HI-102 (investigating the 
effect of severe HI on acalabrutinib and ACP-5862 exposure). 
In study ACE-HI-001, acalabrutinib Cmax values were 1.90-fold greater in subjects with mild hepatic 
insufficiency and similar (1.02-fold) in subjects with moderate hepatic insufficiency compared to 
subjects with normal hepatic function. AUC0-last values were 1.90-fold greater in subjects with mild 
hepatic insufficiency and 1.48-fold in subjects with moderate hepatic insufficiency, compared to 
subjects with normal hepatic function. 
In study ACE-HI-102, geometric mean total acalabrutinib Cmax, AUC0-inf and AUC0-last values were 4.92 -
fold, 5.16 -fold and 5.28 -fold, respectively, greater in subjects with severe hepatic insufficiency 
compared to subjects with normal hepatic function.  Geometric mean unbound acalabrutinib Cmax and 
AUC0-last values were 3.77 -fold and 3.55 -fold, respectively, greater in subjects with severe hepatic 
insufficiency compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. 
Geometric mean total and unbound ACP-5862 Cmax, AUC0-inf and and AUC0-last values in subjects with 
severe hepatic insufficiency were similar to those in subjects with normal hepatic function (between 
0.88- to 1.01-fold of healthy subjects).  
Assessment report

Thus, a 5-fold increase in Cmax and total exposure of acalabrutinib was seen in subjects with severe 
hepatic impairment. The exposure of the active metabolite ACP-5862 was however similar in subjects 
with severe hepatic impairment as in healthy volunteers. See Figure 15 and Figure 16.

•  Sex, race/ethnicity, weight, age 
The effect of demographic covariates on acalabrutinib/ACP-5862 were investigated in the population PK 
analysis. According to the covariate analysis the effect of sex, race/ethnicity, body weight and age 
were not found to be statistically significant on any PK parameters. The population PK analysis, based 
on a population with a mean ± SD age of 61.0±14.5 years (range 18.0–90.0 years of age) for 
acalabrutinib, and 68.1±9.70 years (range 18.0–88.0 years of age) for ACP-5862. The 
pharmacokinetics of acalabrutinib/ACP-5862 has not been studied in subjects less than 18 years of 
age.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Acalabrutinib as victim of drug interactions 
Acalabrutinib and the active metabolite ACP-5862 (formed via CYP3A4 metabolism) are substrates for 
CYP3A4, P-gp and BCRP in vitro.  
Itraconazole (strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitor) increased acalabrutinib Cmax and AUC 3.7- and 5.1-
fold respectively. No marked differences in half-life values were observed (3.3 vs 2.5 hours). 
Following a single dose of rifampicin (inhibitor of OATP1B1/1B3, P-gp and BCRP), peak exposure of 
acalabrutinib was approximately 1.23-fold higher than with acalabrutinib alone and the overall 
exposure was 1.36- and 1.29-fold higher (AUC0-last and AUC0-inf respectively).  
Multiple doses of rifampicin (strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inducer) decreased acalabrutinib Cmax and AUC 
by 68 and 77% respectively. The half-life was somewhat shorter following rifampicin treatment, 0.8 vs 
1.6 hours.

The active metabolite was not measured in the interaction studies, but the applicant has attempted to 
simulate metabolite exposure following treatment with strong (and moderate) CYP3A4 inhibitors and 
inducers and to suggest SmPC recommendations based on these simulations. However, the model was 
not sufficiently qualified and is not currently used to support any claims. 
Absorption of acalabrutinib is affected by substances increasing gastric pH. Concomitant administration 
with calcium carbonate resulted in 75% lower Cmax and 53% lower AUC of acalabrutinib. Following pre-
treatment with omeprazole, acalabrutinib had 43% lower AUC0-t, 36% lower AUC0-inf and 72% lower 
Cmax. Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) were found to be a statistically significant covariate in the 
population PK analysis. The results indicate that acalabrutinib exposures were lower with concomitant 
PPI use (36% decrease).  
Acalabrutinib as perpetrator of drug interactions 
Based on in vitro data, for acalabrutinib inhibition cannot be completely excluded for intestinal CYP3A4 
since the IC50 values for direct inhibition and TDI of CYP3A4 were below the cut-off value for 
interaction risk at the intestinal level (86 µM).  
In vitro studies indicate that acalabrutinib does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, CYP2D6, UGT1A1 or UGT2B7 at clinically relevant concentrations.  
In vitro studies indicate that ACP-5862 does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, 
CYP2D6, CYP3A4/5, UGT1A1 or UGT2B7 at clinically relevant concentrations. 
In vitro studies indicate that acalabrutinib induces CYP1A2.  
Based on in vitro data, the risk of induction of intestinal CYP3A4 by acalabrutinib cannot be excluded 
since a 2.44-fold increase was seen in one donor at the highest concentration (50 µM) and the cut-off 
for intestinal enzymes are 86 µM. 
For CYP2B6, induction by acalabrutinib was observed at the highest concentration but no signs of 
induction were seen at the lower concentrations which is most relevant, and consequently no 
evaluation of interaction potential of CYP2B6 in vivo is necessary. 
ACP-5862 did not induce CYP1A2 or CYP2B6. For CYP3A4 induction was observed at the highest 
concentration but no signs of induction were seen at the lower concentrations which are most relevant. 
For BCRP, in vivo inhibition by acalabrutinib cannot be excluded as the in vitro IC50 value of 40.9 µM is 
lower than the cut-off used for evaluation of intestinal interaction potential in vivo (0.1*Dose/250 mL 
= 86 µM). 
Metabolite ACP-5862 was shown in vitro to be an inhibitor of MATE1 with an IC50 value of 0.2 µM.  
Acalabrutinib and ACP-5862 do not inhibit P-gp, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3 or MATE2-K 
at clinically relevant concentrations. Acalabrutinib does not inhibit MATE1 and ACP-5862 does not 
inhibit BCRP at clinically relevant concentrations. 
No study with oral contraceptives has been submitted.

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Exposure-efficacy relationship 
The exposure metric used for the exposure-response analyses was steady state cumulative AUC 
estimated over 24h (AUC24h,ss). To account for contribution of the major active metabolite, ACP-
5862, to overall efficacy and safety, acalabrutinib and ACP-5862 molar exposures were adjusted with

received oral doses of acalabrutinib 100-mg BID. 
Exposure-safety relationship 
Exposure-safety analyses were performed on a pooled dataset (overall population; n=573) and 
predefined subsets of subjects with B-cell malignancies who received acalabrutinib as monotherapy or 
in combination, across 8 clinical studies. In the studies, acalabrutinib was administered orally as once-
daily (QD; 100 mg, 175 mg, 200 mg, and 250 mg) or twice-daily (BID; 100 mg and 200 mg) 
regimens. The relationships between acalabrutinib AUC24h,ss and the incidence of selected AEs 
(percentage of subjects with a specific AE) are shown below. Acalabrutinib AUC24h,ss were comparable 
regardless of whether Grade ≥2 or Grade ≥3 any AEs were present or absent. With the exception of 
Grade ≥2 infection, there were no trends between higher acalabrutinib exposures and the selected 
ECIs. These results (in the overall population) were consistent across all safety sub-populations, 
including CLL Naive, Total CLL, CLL Mono, CLL Combo, and Mono HemMalig.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of acalabrutinib and its active metabolite, M27 (ACP-5862), were studied in 
healthy subjects and in patients with B-cell malignancies. Acalabrutinib exhibits dose-proportionality, 
and both acalabrutinib and ACP-5862 exhibit almost linear PK across a dose range of 75 to 250 mg. 
Population PK modelling suggests that the PK of acalabrutinib and ACP-5862 is similar across patients 
with different B-cell malignancies. At the recommended dose of 100 mg twice daily in patients with B-
cell malignancies (including, CLL), the geometric mean steady state daily area under the plasma 
concentration over time curve (AUC24h) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) for acalabrutinib 
were 1679 ng•h/mL and 438 ng/mL, respectively, and for ACP-5862 were 4166 ng•h/mL and 
446 ng/mL, respectively. The metabolite, M27 is approximately 50% less potent than acalabrutinib but 
with higher plasma exposure (AUC 2-3-fold higher than parent). The metabolite was not measured in 
for example the interaction studies, which is a great weakness, attempts to simulate metabolite 
exposure following co-administration with CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers as discussed where the active 
moiety concept was used. 
A physiologically based pharmacokinetic model approach has been used to describe the effects of 
CYP3A4 inhibition and induction, both with acalabrutinib as a victim and perpetrator. Furthermore, the 
PBPK model has been used to investigate the behaviour of the active metabolite in combination with 
CYP3A4 inhibition/induction. A population PK analysis has been used to mainly describe covariate

effects; demographic as well as intrinsic/extrinsic factors. The results from the analysis indicate that 
the final model describes patient PK data well but there are some indications of model misspecification 
for the healthy subject data. As the main objective was to describe CLL patient PK the final PK model 
as presented is accepted.  
The time to peak plasma concentrations (Tmax) was 0.5-1.5hours for acalabrutinib, and 1.0 hour for 
ACP-5862. The absolute bioavailability of Calquence is estimated to 25.3%. It can be concluded that 
the degree of absorption is larger than what the absolute bioavailability would indicate, and together 
the available data show that the degree of absorption is rather high, but it cannot be clearly concluded 
that the absorption can be classified as complete according to the BCS concept (above 85%).  
There was a significant decrease in Cmax by 69% and a delay in tmax by 1-2 hours when the product 
was taken with a high-fat meal compared to the fasted state, while there was no significant effect on 
AUC (results slightly outside BE acceptance criteria). The food effect study was not performed with the 
commercial formulation but with the previous blend in capsule formulation, however, based on a cross-
study comparison the effect of omeprazole seems to be lower on the final formulation compared to the 
earlier formulation. Thus it is not considered likely that the effect of food (due to increased pH) would 
be larger on the commercial formulation than on the earlier formulation. It is agreed that acalabrutinib 
can be taken with or without food, since the effect of food on Cmax is not likely to be clinically relevant 
and considering the food recommendations in the phase 3 studies (see section 5.2 of the SmPC). 
Reversible binding to human plasma protein was 97.5% for acalabrutinib and 98.6% for ACP-5862. 
The in vitro mean blood-to-plasma ratio was 0.8 for acalabrutinib and 0.7 for ACP-5862. The mean 
steady state volume of distribution (Vss) was approximately 34 L for acalabrutinib. 
In vitro, acalabrutinib is predominantly metabolised by CYP3A enzymes, and to a minor extent by 
glutathione conjugation and amide hydrolysis. ACP-5862 was identified as the major metabolite in 
plasma, that was further metabolized primarily by CYP3A-mediated oxidation, with a geometric mean 
exposure (AUC) that was approximately 2- to 3-fold higher than the exposure of acalabrutinib. ACP-
5862 is approximately 50% less potent than acalabrutinib with regard to BTK inhibition. 
In vitro studies indicate that acalabrutinib does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, CYP2D6, UGT1A1 or UGT2B7 at clinically relevant concentrations and is unlikely to affect 
clearance of substrates of these CYPs. 
In vitro studies indicate that ACP-5862 does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, 
CYP2D6, CYP3A4/5, UGT1A1 or UGT2B7 at clinically relevant concentrations and is unlikely to affect 
clearance of substrates of these CYPs. 
In vitro studies indicate that acalabrutinib and ACP-5862 are P-gp and BCRP substrates. Co-
administration with BCRP inhibitors is however unlikely to result in clinically relevant drug interactions. 
Co-administration with an OATP1B1/1B3 inhibitor (600 mg rifampin, single dose) resulted in an 
increase in acalabrutinib Cmax and AUC by 1.2-fold and 1.4-fold (N=24, healthy subjects), respectively, 
which is not clinically relevant. Acalabrutinib and ACP-5862 do not inhibit P-gp, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, 
OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and MATE2-K at clinically relevant concentrations. Acalabrutinib may inhibit 
intestinal BCRP, while ACP-5862 may inhibit MATE1 at clinically relevant concentrations (see section 
4.5). Acalabrutinib does not inhibit MATE1, while ACP-5862 does not inhibit BCRP at clinically relevant 
concentrations. 
Following a single oral dose of 100 mg acalabrutinib, the terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of 
acalabrutinib was) 1 to 2 hours. The t1/2 of the active metabolite, ACP-5862, was approximately 7 
hours. The mean apparent oral clearance (CL/F) was 134 L/hr for acalabrutinib and 22 L/hr for ACP-
5862 in patients with B-cell malignancies.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/458179/2020  
Page 65/147 
 
 
 
The elimination pathways of acalabrutinib have been sufficiently elucidated. Following administration of 
a single 100 mg radiolabelled [14C]-acalabrutinib dose in healthy subjects, 84% of the dose was 
recovered in the faeces and 12% of the dose was recovered in the urine, with less than 2% of the dose 
excreted as unchanged acalabrutinib; thus metabolism is the main elimination pathway.  
The plasma protein binding results are from different studies and according to the CHMP guideline on 
DDI (CPMP/EWP/560/95 Rev1) it is recommended to determine the protein binding in the same study 
if the protein binding of parent and metabolite is high so as not to introduce inter-study variability. In 
addition, the studied concentration interval (1, 3 and 10 µM) is high compared to plasma 
concentrations seen in clinical studies (Cmax of 466 ng/ml = 1 µM). New plasma protein binding data 
including acalabrutinib and its metabolite ACP-5862 in the same study using clinically relevant 
concentration range of acalabrutinib and ACP-5862 should be submitted post-approval as 
recommended by the CHMP. 
The mean terminal t1/2 of total radioactivity in plasma was 46.5 hours while the half-life for parent drug 
was 1.47 hours, indicating presence of metabolites with longer half-life than parent drug. In whole 
blood, the terminal half-life could not be calculated but is clearly long - likely due to covalent binding of 
acalabrutinib to BTK in blood cells. M27 is a major metabolite (representing 34.7% of total 
radioactivity), that needs to be screened for enzyme inhibitory potential, but no other metabolites need 
to be further characterised. Approximately 67% of the total radioactivity in plasma is identified. This is 
considered acceptable since the metabolite M27 contributing more than 10% of the AUC of drug 
related material has been structurally characterised. The non-identified drug radioactivity is likely 
numerous trace amount metabolites. 
Based on population PK analysis, age (>18 years of age), sex, race (Caucasian, African American) and 
body weight did not have clinically meaningful effects on the PK of acalabrutinib and its active 
metabolite, ACP-5862. No pharmacokinetic studies were performed with Calquence in patients under 
18 years of age. 
Given the differences in exposures (AUC and Cmax) between the capsule and blend-in-capsule 
formulations, the impact of formulation was evaluated in the population PK model and its inclusion did 
not statistically improve the model performance and parameter precision. The simulation-based 
analysis showed that no significant impact on the exposure metrics is expected due to the influence of 
formulation effect, demonstrating the lack of any clinically relevant effect.  
There is a tendency to more than dose-proportional increase in exposure with increasing dose in the 
dose range 2.5 to 400 mg (although the study Study ACE-CL-001 showed less than dose-proportional 
increase in the dose range 100 QD to 400 mg QD). However, there seems to be no major deviation 
from dose-proportionality in the dose range 75 to 250 mg. 
Renal clearance following IV administration was 0.654 L/h and filtration (fu*GFR) is expected to be 
around 0.2 L/h, thus active renal secretion seems to be included in the renal elimination of 
acalabrutinib. However, renal clearance of unchanged parent drug is a very minor elimination pathway 
and thus any effect on renal transporters is not likely to affect the elimination of acalabrutinib. In vivo 
interconversion of acalabrutinib to the other enantiomer is unlikely to be clinically relevant.  
It can be agreed that no dedicated renal study is needed, since renal elimination is a minor pathway. A 
large proportion of the patients in the pop PK analysis had mild RI, so this is covered in the safety 
population (see discussion on Clinical safety). Based on population PK analysis, no clinically relevant PK 
difference was observed in 408 subjects with mild renal impairment (eGFR between 60 and 
89 mL/min/1.73m2 as estimated by MDRD), 109 subjects with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 
between 30 and 59 mL/min/1.73m2) relative to 192 subjects with normal renal function (eGFR greater 
than or equal to 90 mL/min/1.73m2). The PK of acalabrutinib has not been characterised in patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/458179/2020  
Page 66/147 
 
 
 
with severe renal impairment (eGFR less than 29 mL/min/1.73m2) or renal impairment requiring 
dialysis. Patients with creatinine levels greater than 2.5 times the institutional ULN were not included in 
the clinical studies (see SmPC section 4.2 and 5.2). 
Acalabrutinib is metabolised in the liver. In dedicated hepatic impairment (HI) studies, compared to 
subjects with normal liver function (n=6), acalabrutinib exposure (AUC) was increased by 1.9-fold, 
1.5-fold and 5.3-fold in subjects with mild (n=6) (Child-Pugh A), moderate (n=6) (Child-Pugh B) and 
severe (n=8) (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment, respectively. Subjects in the moderate HI group were 
however not significantly affected in markers relevant for the elimination capacity of drugs, so the 
effect of moderate hepatic impairment was likely underestimated in this study. Based on a population 
PK analysis, no clinically relevant difference was observed between subjects with mild (n=79) or 
moderate (n=6) hepatic impairment (total bilirubin between 1.5 to 3 times ULN and any AST) relative 
to subjects with normal (n=613) hepatic function (total bilirubin and AST within ULN) (see SmPC 
section 4.2). 
Subjects in the moderate HI group were however mainly affected in aspects not primarily related to 
elimination capacity of drugs (such as encephalopathy and ascites) and not in markers that are likely 
to be relevant for the elimination capacity of drugs (such as albumin, bilirubin and prothrombin time), 
so the effect of moderate HI is likely underestimated in the submitted study. The number of subjects 
with moderate (and severe) HI in the population PK-analysis was very low, and thus this analysis 
cannot contribute much in concluding about the effect of moderate HI. Acalabrutinib is not 
recommended in severe HI, but can be given without dose adjustment in patients with mild and 
moderate HI; the risk of increased exposure of acalabrutinib in patients with moderate HI that are 
affected in markers relevant for the elimination capacity, was analysed in two subjects from the 
moderate HI cohorts (Child-Pugh B) that were affected regarding albumin, and two subjects from the 
severe HI cohorts that were closest to the Child-Pugh B classification. The expected daily exposure 
following normal dosing (based on the mean AUC0-last obtained for these 4 subjects) is within the 
established exposure-safety relationship. However, the variability is large and the data is based on 
very few subjects. Thus, as a precaution a recommendation to monitor patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment closely for signs of toxicity has been included in the SmPC (see section 4.2 and 4.4).  
The effect of severe HI on the parent drug acalabrutinib was similar to the effect of a strong CYP34 
inhibitor on acalabrutinib exposure. The applicant has simulated metabolite exposure with concomitant 
CYP3A4 inhibition, where a significant decrease in metabolite exposure was predicted, in contrast to 
the metabolite results from the study in severe HI where the metabolite exposure was unchanged. One 
explanation for this deviation in results could be that in patients with severe HI, intestinal CYP3A4 
metabolism would likely not be affected, while concomitant treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors would 
also affect intestinal CYP3A4 metabolism. However, this discrepancy contributes to the doubts 
regarding the PBPK model and the uncertainty regarding the effect of CYP3A4 inhibition on metabolite 
exposure and also regarding the relative contribution of intestine versus liver to the metabolism. 
There is an ongoing study that will provide information regarding the effect of moderate CYP3A 
inhibitors on parent as well as on metabolite exposure. Until data from this study is available, and 
considering the safety profile as well as the uncertainty regarding the lower limit of exposure in 
relation to efficacy, the suggested recommendation to use the normal dose but monitor patients 
closely for adverse reactions in case of concomitant treatment with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors can be 
agreed. The results from the currently ongoing drug-drug interaction (DDI) study (ACE-HV-115; 
evaluating the pharmacokinetics of acalabrutinib and ACP-5862 administered alone or in combination 
with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors fluconazole or isavuconazole), the updated PBPK model based on the 
results of Study ACE-HV-115 and possible suggested revisions of recommendations for co-
administering acalabrutinib with CYP3A inhibitors should be submitted post-approval as recommended 
by the CHMP. It is not assumed that any revisions regarding recommendations for CYP3A inducers will 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/458179/2020  
Page 67/147 
 
 
 
be possible based on this study and the revised model. Concomitant use with strong CYP3A4 inducers 
should be avoided (see SmPC section 4.5).   
Concomitant use of PPIs is not recommended, and for antacids and H2-blockers, staggered dosing is 
suggested. The effect of antacids on gastric pH has short duration, and thus administration of 
acalabrutinib 2 hours after administration of an antacid will likely not result in clinically relevant effects 
on the bioavailability of acalabrutinib due to effects on gastric pH. Also, since acalabrutinib is quickly 
absorbed, administration of antacids (or H2 blockers with slower onset of effect than antacids) 2 hours 
after acalabrutinib administration will also likely not result in clinically relevant effects on the 
bioavailability of acalabrutinib. It is not entirely clear if a 10 hour interval between a H2 blocker and 
the next acalabrutinib dose is sufficient in order to completely avoid an effect on acalabrutinib 
absorption, but this limit is considered reasonable and will likely not result in clinically relevant effects 
on acalabrutinib exposure. (see section 4.5 of the SmPC). 
The in vitro results of acalabrutinib as a substrate for OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3 or OCT2 is 
inconclusive since the tested concentrations are too high and may saturate the transporters. The risk 
of interaction with OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 inhibitors do not need to be repeated as an in vivo study with 
rifampicin has been performed showing a small not clinically relevant interaction. In vitro studies for 
the transporters OAT1, OAT3 and OCT2 do not need to be repeated since the renal secretion is 
estimated to be <25%. 
Acalabrutinib and ACP-5862 are substrates for BCRP, but available data do not suggest that BCRP 
transport in the gut would limit the absorption of acalabrutinib to a large extent, given the signs of 
fairly high degree of absorption, linear pharmacokinetics in the clinical dose range. In addition, 
available pharmacogenetic data do not indicate that a clinically relevant effect of BCRP inhibitors is 
likely. Thus, in the SmPC it is stated that a clinically relevant interaction is unlikely. 
Based on a cross-study comparison, the exposure of the sensitive CYP3A4 substrate venetoclax was in 
the same range following co-administration with acalabrutinib as without acalabrutinib, indicating no 
large potential for acalabrutinib to inhibit intestinal CYP3A4 in vivo. However, the risk of a weak 
inhibition of CYP3A substrates cannot be completely excluded and a warning is included in section 4.5 
of the SmPC.  
Co-administration of acalabrutinib with CYP1A2 substrates (e.g. theophylline, caffeine) may decrease 
their exposure, which is reflected in the SmPC. 
Based on in vitro DDI data for acalabrutinib, a risk for induction of intestinal CYP3A4 could not be 
excluded. However, considering the totality of data (vague in vitro signal, venetoclax data and no signs 
of auto-induction of acalabrutinib clearance) it´s considered unlikely that acalabrutinib will induce 
intestinal CYP3A4 and result in clinically relevant interactions when co-administered with CYP3A 
substrates. 
Acalabrutinib is not teratogenic according to preclinical studies but causes embryo/foetal toxicity. It 
should therefore not be used during pregnancy, and women of childbearing potential should be advised 
to avoid becoming pregnant. The proposed indication is not expected to include women of childbearing 
potential to a large extent. Based on the submitted data it is unlikely that acalabrutinib will induce 
intestinal CYP3A4 and result in clinically relevant interactions when co-administered with CYP3A 
substrates, and thus efficacy of oral contraceptives is not expected to be affected during acalabrutinib 
treatment (see SmPC section 4.5 and 4.6).   
The dose-BTK occupancy analyses across doses and populations indicate that the proposed 100 mg 
BID dose result in a consistent high occupancy (>95%) with the least amount of variability between 
individuals.

The exposure-efficacy relationship has been analysed with total active AUC, where the concentration of 
the active metabolite has been adjusted for the relative potency which is accepted. Furthermore, the 
applicant states that a wide range of exposure has been used in the exposure-efficacy analysis. 
However only one dose level was included in study ACE-CL-007 which makes it difficult to separate the 
exposure effect from other confounding factors. Although no apparent relationship between exposure 
and efficacy was detected, as the exposure range was related to one dose level the exposure-efficacy 
results should be interpreted with caution. 
An increase in acalabrutinib exposure of up to approximately 2.5-fold can be expected to be safe and 
well-tolerated and that a decrease in exposure of up to approximately 50% can be expected to have no 
clinically relevant impact on efficacy. The exposure-safety analyses indicate that acalabrutinib is safe 
over a wide exposure range based on a pooled dataset which included several dose levels and multiple 
safety endpoints. Model-based exposure-safety analyses (logistic regression) were subsequently 
performed between AUC24h,ss and infections, where no statistically significant relationship was detected. 
Overall, it is agreed that no alarming exposure-safety relationships were detected. In the exposure-
safety analyses, the exposure range was (min to max) AUC0-24h of 559.2 – 4744 ng*h/mL for a dose 
range of 100 mg once daily to 200 mg twice daily, including the highest dose of 400 mg once daily. 
Hence, it is indicated that an AUC24h,ss up to approximately 4500 ng/mL*h remains safe. However, the 
lower limit of exposure in relation to efficacy remains unknown. 
The CHMP recommended that additional long-term stability data for the metabolite should be 
submitted post-approval. Overall, the presented dosing rationale to support the fixed 100-mg BID 
acalabrutinib dose seems reasonable. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology aspects of acalabrutinib are sufficiently studied; all relevant information is 
included in the SmPC. Further, the CHMP recommends that the applicant submits:   
• 
The results from the currently ongoing drug-drug interaction (DDI) study (ACE-HV-115; 
evaluating the pharmacokinetics of acalabrutinib and ACP-5862 administered alone or in 
combination with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors fluconazole or isavuconazole), the updated PBPK 
model based on the results of Study ACE-HV-115 and possible suggested revisions of 
recommendations for co-administering acalabrutinib with CYP3A inhibitors should be submitted.  
•  Additional long-term stability data for the metabolite ACP-5862, up to 1224 days (i.e., 75 
additional days), in order to cover the maximum storage from collection to extraction for the

Improvement of Disease-Related Symptoms 
-  Sustained Hematologic Improvement 
Assessment for tumor response and progression will be conducted in accordance with the IWCLL 2008 
criteria until disease progression. Disease assessments will be done every 12 weeks (± 14 days) with 
the first on-treatment radiologic assessment occurring on Cycle 4 Day 1, the second on-treatment scan 
on Cycle 7 Day 1, and so on through Cycle 25, and then every 24 weeks (± 14 days) thereafter for all 
subjects (including subjects who discontinue from study treatment due to an AE or any reason) until 
confirmation of disease progression or death, consent withdrawal, or lost to follow up. Subjects from 
Arm A who have IRC-confirmed disease progression may be eligible to receive single agent 
acalabrutinib at 100 mg PO BID at investigator discretion. 
Sample size  
The study was expected to enrol approximately 510 subjects with a 1:1:1 randomization ratio between 
the  3  treatment  arms  (approximately  170  subjects  per  arm).  The  study  was  sized  to  achieve 
approximately  90%  power  to  detect  a  hazard  ratio  (acalabrutinib  +  obinutuzumab/  obinutuzumab  + 
chlorambucil) of 0.6 for PFS which, under the model assumptions, translates into a 67% relative and 
17.8  months  absolute  increase  in  median  PFS  time:  a  median  of  26.7  months  for  subjects  in  the 
obinutuzumab+chlorambucil arm vs. 44.5 months for subjects in the acalabrutinib+obinutuzumab arm.  
Given the study assumptions, the minimum detectable treatment difference at the final analysis of PFS 
corresponds to a hazard ratio (HR) of approximately 0.735.

Randomisation  
Randomisation was stratified by presence versus absence of 17p deletion by central laboratory, ECOG 
performance status (0, 1 versus 2) and geographic region (North America and Western Europe versus 
Other).   
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
The primary efficacy analysis was to compare PFS as assessed by IRC between 
obinutuzumab+chlorambucil (arm B) and acalabrutinib+obinutuzumab (arm A) in the ITT population 
using a stratified log rank test adjusting for randomization stratification factors. 
The null and alternative hypotheses are as follows:  
H0:  
𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 𝐵𝐵 = 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 𝐴𝐴
HA:  
𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 𝐵𝐵 ≠ 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 𝐴𝐴
The test will be conducted to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative while showing that Arm 
B is superior to Arm A.   
Analyses using the ITT population included data only prior to treatment switch for obinutuzumab + 
chlorambucil subjects who crossed over to acalabrutinib monotherapy.   
One interim analysis and one final analysis for PFS are planned. The data submitted from study ACE-
CL-007 was from a pre-planned interim analysis.  
The final analysis of PFS is planned to occur when a total of 167 PFS events have been observed, which 
is anticipated to occur at 49 months after the first subject is randomized. 
The interim analysis of PFS will be conducted when approximately two-thirds of the final analysis PFS 
event goal (i.e., 111 events across Arms A and B) have been observed, which is expected to occur 
approximately 34 months after the first subject has been randomized. 
Alternatively, a time-based interim analysis may be conducted if the required number of events have 
not occurred by 24 months after the last subject randomized.  
The applicant split α into α1 and α2 for interim and final analyses. Secondary endpoints were tested in 
a hierarchical order separately for interim and final analyses.

Nine subjects were randomized but did not receive study drug; 1 subject in the acalabrutinib 
monotherapy arm (withdraw consent) and 8 subjects in the Obin+Clb arm (5 withdraw consent, 2 
deaths (car accident and sepsis), and 1 ineligible per sponsor). Thus, given the open-label design of 
the study, biased early censoring, although limited, cannot be excluded. 
Recruitment 
The study enrolled 535 subjects at 142 centres in 18 countries between 14 September 2015 and 08 
February 2017, and 526 subjects received study treatment. The regions with the highest percentage of 
enrolled subjects included North America (36.4%), Western Europe (26.7%), Central and Eastern 
Europe (25.0%), Australia and New Zealand (8.0%), and South America (3.7%). 
Conduct of the study 
There were 5 global protocol amendments undertaken, none deemed critical.

Secondary Variables 
PFS by IRC Assessment – Key Secondary Endpoint 
The key secondary efficacy endpoint was IRC-assessed PFS comparing obinutuzumab+chlorambucil (Arm 
A) with acalabrutinib monotherapy (Arms C). With a median follow-up of 28.4 months in the acalabrutinib 
monotherapy arm (Arm C) and 28 months in the obinutuzumab+chlorambucil arm (Arm B), the median 
estimated PFS for acalabrutinib monotherapy (Arm C) was not reached; the median estimated PFS for 
obinutuzumab+chlorambucil (Arm A) was 22.6 months (95% CI: 20.2–27.6). 
Based  on  the  stratified  analysis,  acalabrutinib  monotherapy  showed  a  statistically  significant 
improvement in IRC-assessed PFS compared with obinutuzumab + chlorambucil, with an 80% reduction 
in risk of disease progression or death (HR=0.2 [95% CI: 0.13–0.3]; p<0.0001). 
The KM estimate of the proportion of subjects without a PFS event at 12 months was 92.9% (95% CI: 
87.8–95.9) 
for 
acalabrutinib  monotherapy 
and

Exploratory Variables 
Investigator-Assessed PFS and ORR 
Based  on  the  stratified  analysis,  both  acalabrutinib+obinutuzumab  and  acalabrutinib  monotherapy 
demonstrated  a  statistically  significant  improvement  in  investigator-assessed  PFS  compared  with 
obinutuzumab+chlorambucil (HR=0.12 [95% CI: 0.07–0.21]; p<0.0001) and (HR=0.16 [95% CI: 0.1–
0.27];  p<0.0001),  respectively.  The  unstratified  analysis  was  also  statistically  significant  for  both 
treatment  arms  (p<0.0001).  As  of  the  data  cut-off  date,  the  median  estimated  PFS  for 
acalabrutinib+obinutuzumab  and  acalabrutinib  monotherapy  was  not  reached;  the  median  estimated 
PFS for obinutuzumab+chlorambucil was 27.8 months (95% CI: 22.6–28.8). 
Assessment report

The  KM  estimate  of  the  proportion  of  responders  without  an  investigator-assessed  PFS  event  at  12 
months was 95.4% (95% CI: 91.1–97.7) for acalabrutinib+obinutuzumab, 94.7% (95% CI: 90.1–97.2) 
for acalabrutinib monotherapy, and 85.5% (95% CI: 79.1–90) for obinutuzumab+chlorambucil. The KM 
estimate of the proportion of responders without a PFS event at 36 months was 90.9% (95% CI: 85.3–
94.5),  87.6%  (95%  CI:  81–92.1),  and  36.9%  (95%  CI:  26.6–47.1)  for  acalabrutinib+obinutuzumab, 
acalabrutinib monotherapy, and obinutuzumab+chlorambucil, respectively. 
Concordance between IRC-Assessed and Investigator-Assessed Progressive Disease  
The overall concordance rates between the IRC-assessed and investigator-assessed progressive disease 
for  acalabrutinib+obinutuzumab,  acalabrutinib  monotherapy,  and  obinutuzumab+chlorambucil  were 
96.6%, 93.3%, and 89.3%, respectively. 
Concordance between IRC-and Investigator-Assessed Progressive Disease (ITT Population) 
Investigator-Assessed ORR 
Investigator-assessed ORR (CR+CRi+nPR+PR) and ORR including partial response with lymphocytosis 
(CR+CRi+nPR+PR+PRL) were consistent with the analysis of the secondary variable (IRC-assessed ORR 
and ORR including PRL).  
Per investigator assessment, CR was achieved in 38 subjects in the acalabrutinib+obinutuzumab arm, 
13 subjects in acalabrutinib monotherapy arm, and 23 subjects in the obinutuzumab+chlorambucil arm. 
PR was achieved in 117 (65.4%) subjects in the acalabrutinib+obinutuzumab arm, 138 (77.1%) subjects 
in  the  acalabrutinib  monotherapy  arm,  and  112  (63.3%)  subjects  in  the  obinutuzumab+chlorambucil 
arm. 
The  investigator-assessed  ORR  for  acalabrutinib+obinutuzumab,  acalabrutinib  monotherapy,  and 
obinutuzumab+chlorambucil was 96.1% (95% CI: 92.1–98.1), 89.4% (95% CI:84.0–93.1), and 82.5% 
(95%  CI:  76.2–87.4), 
respectively.  The 
investigator-assessed  ORR  difference  between 
acalabrutinib+obinutuzumab  and  obinutuzumab+chlorambucil  was  13.6%(95%  CI:  7.3–19.9),  which 
was statistically significant (p<0.0001). The investigator-assessed ORR difference between acalabrutinib 
monotherapy and obinutuzumab+chlorambucil was 6.9% (95% CI: -0.3–14.1) (p=0.0522). 
The 
investigator-assessed  ORR 
including  PRL 
for  acalabrutinib+obinutuzumab,  acalabrutinib 
monotherapy,  and  obinutuzumab+chlorambucil  was  96.6%  (95%  CI:  92.9–98.5),  92.2%  (95%  CI: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/458179/2020

87.3–95.3), and 82.5% (95% CI: 76.2–87.4). Per the investigator assessment, PRL was achieved in 1 
subject in the acalabrutinib+obinutuzumab arm, 5 subjects in the acalabrutinib monotherapy arm, and 
no  subjects  in  the  obinutuzumab+chlorambucil  arm.  The  investigator-assessed  ORR  including  PRL 
difference between acalabrutinib+obinutuzumab and obinutuzumab+chlorambucil was 14.2% (95% CI: 
8.0–20.4),  which  was  statistically  significant  (p<0.0001).  The  investigator-assessed  ORR  difference 
between  acalabrutinib  monotherapy  and  obinutuzumab+chlorambucil  was  9.7%  (95%  CI:  2.8–16.5), 
which was also statistically significant (p=0.0048). 
Concordance Between IRC-Assessed and Investigator-Assessed CR/CRi and Best Overall Response 
The  overall  concordance  rates  between  the  IRC-assessed  and  investigator-assessed  CR/Cri  for 
acalabrutinib+obinutuzumab, acalabrutinib monotherapy, and obinutuzumab+chlorambucil were 86%, 
92.7%, and 90.4%, respectively. Overall rates between the IRC-assessed and investigator-assessed best 
overall 
response 
for 
acalabrutinib+obinutuzumab, 
acalabrutinib  monotherapy, 
and 
obinutuzumab+chlorambucil were 97.8%, 92.7%, and 83.6%, respectively. 
Improvement of Disease-Related Symptoms 
The  number  of  subjects  with  constitutional  symptoms  (fatigue,  fever,  night  sweats,  or  weight  loss) 
present  at  baseline  was  similar  for  acalabrutinib+obinutuzumab,  acalabrutinib  monotherapy,  and 
obinutuzumab+chlorambucil  at  baseline  (96,  104,  and  88  subjects,  respectively).  There  was  a  trend 
toward an improvement in (absence of) constitutional symptoms during treatment across all 3 treatment 
arms for any constitutional symptoms, as well as for individual constitutional symptoms.  
Sustained Hematologic Improvement 
Sustained hematologic improvement was a hematologic improvement that persisted continuously ≥56 
days  (8  weeks)  without  blood  transfusion  or  growth  factors.  Among  subjects  with  cytopenia(s)  at 
baseline, sustained hematologic improvement was similar in the acalabrutinib+obinutuzumab arm and 
acalabrutinib monotherapy arm, but lower in the obinutuzumab+chlorambucil for ANC (88.9%, 90.0%, 
and  50.0%,  respectively),  hemoglobin  (77.6%,  64.7%,  and  49.3%,  respectively),  and  platelet  count 
(81.8%, 87.9%, and 50.0%, respectively). 
Minimal Residual Disease Analysis:  
Peripheral  blood  or  bone  marrow  MRD  negativity  was  observed  in  56%  (24/43)  of  subjects  with 
investigator-assessed CR/CRi who were treated with acalabrutinib in combination with obinutuzumab. In 
the acalabrutinib monotherapy arm, 7%(1/14) of subjects with investigator-assessed CR/CRi were MRD 
negative in peripheral blood, whereas 61%(14/23) of subjects treated with chlorambucil+obinutuzumab 
were MRD negative in peripheral blood or bone marrow as assessed by flow cytometry. 
Overall, there was a 79% concordance (27 of 34 samples) of MRD status between peripheral blood and 
bone marrow as assessed by flow cytometry. 
Ancillary analyses 
Sensitivity Analyses - Primary Endpoint 
The following sensitivity analyses were performed for acalabrutinib+obinutuzumab (Arm B) compared 
with obinutuzumab+chlorambucil (Arm A): unstratified analysis, inclusion of PFS without censoring for 
subsequent anticancer therapy, inclusion of PFS events after 2 or more consecutively missed visits, and 
exclusion of subjects with important protocol deviations.

The key sensitivity analysis of PFS without censoring for subsequent anticancer therapy was consistent 
with the primary analysis and showed similar PFS for acalabrutinib+obinutuzumab (Arm B) compared 
with  obinutuzumab+chlorambucil  (Arm  A)  (stratified:  HR=0.11  [95%  CI:  0.06–0.18];  p<0.0001  and 
unstratified: HR=0.11 [95% CI: 0.06–0.19]; p<0.0001). 
All other sensitivity analyses were also consistent with the primary analysis, with HR ranging from 0.08–
0.11, which was statistically significant for all analyses (p<0.0001).

Hypothesis 
Superiority 
The study is expected to randomize approximately 510 subjects. Subjects will be randomized 
in a 1:1:1 ratio to Arm A, Arm B, or Arm C. Approximately 170 subjects will be randomized 
to each arm. The sample size calculation is driven by hypothesis test between Arm B and 
Arm  A.  The  study  is  sized  to  achieve  approximately  90%  power  to  detect  a  hazard  ratio 
(Arm B/Arm A) of 0.60 for PFS assuming a median PFS of 26.7 months for subjects in Arm 
A (Goede 2014) versus 44.5 months for subjects in Arm B.

Primary Analysis 
To  evaluate  the  efficacy  of  obinutuzumab  in  combination  with  chlorambucil  (Arm  A) 
compared with acalabrutinib in combination with obinutuzumab (Arm B) based on IRC 
assessment of progression-free survival (PFS). 
PFS, defined as the time from date of randomization to the date of first IRC-assessed 
disease  progression  or  death  due  to  any  cause,  whichever  comes  first.  The  primary 
efficacy  analysis  will  be  performed  using  a  stratified  log-rank  test  adjusting  for 
randomization stratification factors.  
The estimate of the hazard ratio (Arm B/Arm A) and its corresponding 95% CI will be 
computed  using  a  Cox  Proportional  Hazards  model  stratified  by  randomization 
stratification factors. KM curve was used to estimate the distribution of PFS. 
Intent-to-treat population is the primary analysis population.

Objectives 
Primary Objective was to evaluate the efficacy of acalabrutinib monotherapy (Arm A) compared with IR 
or BR (Arm B) based on IRC assessment of PFS per IWCLL 2008 criteria (Hallek et al. 2008) with 
incorporation of the clarification for treatment-related lymphocytosis (Cheson et al. 2012), hereafter 
referred to as IWCLL 2008 criteria, in subjects with R/R CLL. 
Secondary Objectives  
To evaluate Arm A compared with Arm B in terms of: Investigator-assessed PFS per IWCLL 2008 
criteria Investigator- and IRC-assessed ORR per IWCLL 2008 criteria (defined as the proportion of 
subjects who achieve a best response of CR, CRi, nPR, or PR) OS; PROs by FACIT-Fatigue ; 
Investigator- and IRC-assessed DOR (defined as the time from the first documentation of objective 
response to the earlier time of disease progression or death from any cause) ; TTNT (defined as the 
time from randomization to institution of non-protocol-specified treatment for CLL) 
Safety Objective 
Incidence and severity of AEs and SAEs 
Exploratory Objectives 
To evaluate Arm A compared with Arm B in terms of: Improvement and/or resolution of disease-
related symptoms; PROs by EORTC QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D-5L ; MRU ; Potential predictive biomarkers 
and mechanisms of resistance for the disease

Secondary endpoints:  
PFS, defined as the time from date of randomization to the date of first investigator assessed disease 
progression or death due to any cause, whichever comes first. KM curve was used to estimate the 
distribution of PFS. 
Best overall response was defined as the best response as assessed by the investigator or IRC on or 
before the initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy. 
 OS was defined as the time from date of randomization to death due to any cause.  
Change from baseline in GFS at Week 24 and Week 48, proportion of subjects with 
improvement/stable/deterioration in GFS, and time to first clinically meaningful improvement in GFS. 
 DOR determined by IRC and by investigators was analyzed in the same fashion as PFS described 
above  
TTNT was analyzed in the same fashion as PFS described above. 
Sample size 
The study was expected  to enrol approximately 306 subjects with a 1:1 randomization ratio between 
Arm-A and Arm-B. With an event-driven design, the final analysis of PFS was planned when a total of 
119 IRC-assessed PFS events had been observed.  
Randomisation 
Subjects in this study were randomized in a 1:1 ratio into the 2 treatment arms using an interactive 
voice/web response system (IXRS). Randomization was stratified by the following factors: Presence of 
17p deletion; ECOG performance status (0 or 1 versus 2); Number of prior therapies (1, 2, or 3 versus 
≥4). 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open label trial. 
Statistical methods 
In analysis of PFS as assessed by IRC subjects were censored at treatment switch. Sensitivity analysis 
without censoring for subsequent anticancer therapy was however performed. In the primary analyses 
of IRC PFS, there were no subjects who were censored due to consecutively missing 2 or more visits. 
In arm A 3 patients withdrew consent, and in arm B 10 patients withdrew consent. The number of 
patients randomised but not treated was 1 in arm A and 2 in arm B.  
The data submitted from study ACE-CL-309 was from a pre-planned interim analysis. The applicant 
split α into α1 and α2 for interim and final analyses. Secondary endpoints were tested in a hierarchical 
order separately for interim and final analyses. It is worth noting that since the test of ORR was not 
statistically significant (p= 0.2248), it will not be possible to formally test OS in the final analysis. 
A cut-off was determined for the interim analysis when approximately 79 IRC-assessed PFS events had 
occurred.  A  snapshot  of  the  database  occurred  after  all  data  through  the  visit  cutoff  date  had  been 
entered and cleaned. The interim analysis was conducted based on a snapshot of the database, which 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/458179/2020  
Page 103/147 
 
 
 
included all available PFS events up to the visit cut-off date. The interim analysis was conducted using 
Lan and DeMets alpha-spending function with O’Brien-Fleming boundaries (O’Brien and Fleming 1979; 
Lan and DeMets 1983).  
Table 21: summary of the planned PFS analyses 
If the primary efficacy endpoint achieved statistical significance, then selected secondary endpoints were 
to be tested in a manner that would preserve the overall Type I error rate at the 2-sided significance 
level of 0.05. The DMC members used their expertise, experience, and judgment to evaluate the safety 
data  from  the  study  on  a  regular  basis  and  to  recommend  to  the  sponsor  whether  the  study  should 
continue  or  be  stopped  early  for  safety.  No  formal  statistical  rules  recommending  early  stopping  for 
safety were planned. 
If the study did not cross the boundary at the interim analysis, the study was to proceed to final analysis. 
A visit cutoff date was to be determined when approximately 119 IRC-assessed PFS events had occurred.  
To control the overall Type I error at 0.05 level, the Lan-DeMets alpha-spending function based on the 
O’Brien-Fleming boundary was used to split α into α1 and α2 for the interim and final analyses, 
respectively. The nominal α1 and α2 levels were determined based on the actual information fraction 
at the time of the interim analysis. If the primary endpoint achieved statistical significance, tests of key 
secondary endpoints of IRC-assessed ORR and OS were to be performed in a sequential hierarchical 
manner based on a closed testing procedure specified as: 1. IRC-assessed ORR; 2. OS 
If the primary endpoint of IRC-assessed PFS achieved statistical significance at the interim analysis, 
the IRC-assessed ORR was to be tested at an α level of 0.05, given that almost all responses would 
have been observed at that time (thus the interim and final analyses of IRCassessed ORR would be the 
same). If the IRC-assessed ORR achieved statistical significance, the OS was to be tested at the same 
α level spent for the primary endpoint of IRC-assessed PFS at interim and final analyses, respectively.

One subject in the acalabrutinib arm and two in the IR/BR arm withdrew consent before receiving any 
study treatment. Within the control arm, 119 subjects were assigned to IR and 36 to BR. The 
assignment per investigator’s choice was performed pre-randomisation. 
Thirty-five subjects (11%) in the control arm (29 subjects (19%) previously on IR and 6 subjects (4%) 
previously on BR) crossed over to acalabrutinib monotherapy. 
Withdrawal of consent was more commonly noted in the control arm, 6.5% vs 1.9%. 
Recruitment 
The study enrolled and randomized 310 subjects at 102 centres in 25 countries between 01 December 
2016 and 17 January 2018, and 307 subjects received study treatment. Countries with the highest 
percentage of enrolled subjects were Poland (22.3%), Czech Republic (19.4%), Ukraine (8.1%), 
Russian Federation (5.2%), Italy (4.8%), Spain (4.5%), Canada (4.2%), and Australia (3.9%). 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments were not considered significant. 
Baseline data 
The median age for all subjects was 67 years (range: 32-90) with 63% of subjects ≥65 years old. Most 
subjects were enrolled in Central and Eastern Europe (64%) or Western Europe (21%). The median

time from initial CLL diagnosis to randomization in the study was 79.0 months. 17p deletion, 11q 
deletion, unmutated IGHV, and TP53 mutation were seen in 16%, 27%, 78%, and 24% of subjects, 
respectively, and 88% of subjects had at least one of these chromosomal characteristics. 
Median number of prior therapies were 1 in the experimental arm and 2 in the control arm. Median 
time since the most recent therapy in the study was 24 months.

Outcomes and estimation 
Study 309 
• 
Primary endpoint: IRC-assessed PFS for control vs acalabrutinib monotherapy using a two-
sided log-rank test, stratified by randomization stratification factors. 
With a median-follow up of 16 months and an event rate of only 44% in the control arm IRC-assessed 
PFS showed a HR of 0.31 [95% CI: 0.20, 0.49]; p<0.0001, in favour of the experimental arm. This 
estimation is based on 19 PD events and 8 deaths in the experimental arm, with the corresponding 
figures for the control arm being 59 and 9, respectively. The median estimated PFS for the 
experimental arm was not reached; the median estimated PFS for the control arm was 16.5 months 
(95%CI: 14.0, 17.1).   
The subgroup analyses consistently favour the experimental arm. It is noted that the point estimate for 
PFS HR is 0.21 for the subgroup of subjects with del 17p or TP53 mutation (n=87) while 0.36 in the 
complementary group. 
Updated results (cutoff 1 August 2019) based on investigator’s assessment: With a median follow-up 
of 22.1 months (range: 0.53-29.11) in the acalabrutinib arm and 21.9 months (range: 0.03-27.73) in 
the IR/BR arm, and event rates of 58% in the control arm and 23% in the experimental arm, the PFS 
HR was 0.27 [95% CI: 0.18, 0.40]; p<0.0001. The outcome is supported by the performed sensitivity 
analyses. The median estimated PFS for acalabrutinib was not reached; the median estimated PFS for 
IR/BR was 16.8 months (95% CI: 14.1, 22.4). 
With 6 months longer follow-up, and an acceptable PFS maturity of 58% in the control arm, outcomes 
remain essentially stable. For the SmPC 5.1, the inferential as well as the updated analysis should be 
presented.

•  Secondary endpoint: IRC-assessed ORR 
In terms of ORR, and ORR including partial response with lymphocytosis, no statistically significant 
difference between study arms was noted, neither per IRC nor per investigator. The ORR per IRC was 
81% in the experimental arm, with no subject reaching CR or CRi. As expected for a BTK inhibitor the 
activity was retained, and numerically higher than for the control, in subjects with del 17p or TP53 
mutation. 
As the ORR by IRC did not reach statistical significance the downstream outcomes are only nominally 
reported. 
•  Secondary endpoint: Time to next treatment 
Based on event fractions of 34% in the control arm, including cross-over (23%), and 14% in the 
experimental arm, the median time to next treatment was not reached for any of the study arms. The 
HR was 0.35 (0.21, 0.58). The median time from first dose to subsequent anticancer therapy was 10 
months in the experimental arm. 
•  Secondary endpoint: OS 
With a median follow-up of around 16 months event rates were low, 12% in the control arm and 10% 
in the experimental arm. Updated information is presented above.

Design 
This randomized, global, multicenter, open-label, Phase 3 study will evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of acalabrutinib monotherapy versus Investigator’s choice of either 
idelalisib/rituximab or bendamustine/rituximab in subjects with R/R CLL.

Duration of main phase: 
The maximum duration of the study is 
approximately 48 months from the first subject 
randomized. Therefore, the end of study will occur 
approximately 48 months after the first subject is 
randomized. Subjects who are still on treatment 
at the end of the study and deriving clinical 
benefit from acalabrutinib treatment may be 
eligible to enroll in a separate rollover study.

Duration of Extension phase: 
Under the model assumption of a median PFS of 31 months for subjects in Arm A 
versus 17 months for subjects in Arm B, the study is sized to achieve approximately 
90% power to detect a hazard ratio (HR; Arm A/Arm B) of 0.55 for PFS. 
The study is expected to enroll approximately 306 subjects with a 1:1 randomization 
ratio between Arm A and B.   
With an event-driven design, the final analysis of PFS is planned when a total of 
119 IRC-assessed PFS events have been observed which is anticipated to occur 
approximately 27 months after the first subject is randomized. The interim analysis of 
PFS will be conducted when approximately two-thirds of the IRC-assessed PFS events 
for the final analysis (i.e., 79 events) have been observed.  
Arm A: Acalabrutinib 100 mg 
orally (PO) twice per day (BID)  
Arm B: Investigator’s choice of: 
• Idelalisib 150 mg PO BID in 
combination rituximab  
or  
• Bendamustine in combination 
with rituximab  
Acalabrutinib 100 mg orally (PO) twice per day 
(BID) administered until an 
unacceptable drug-related toxicity occurs or until 
disease progression (n=155) 
• Idelalisib 150 mg PO BID administered in 
combination with ≤ 8 doses of intravenous 
(IV) rituximab (first dose at 375 mg/m2, 
subsequent doses at 500 mg/m2 IV every 
2 weeks for 4 infusions, then every 4 weeks for an 
additional 3 infusions) until 
disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
• Bendamustine 70 mg/m2 IV (Day 1 and 2 of 
each cycle) in combination with 
rituximab IV (375 mg/m2/500 mg/m2) on Day 1 
of each cycle for up to 6 cycles.

on the actual information fraction at the time of the interim analysis. Within each analysis, 
the fixed sequence procedure would be utilized to adjust for multiple comparisons. The

Supportive study ACE-CL-001 
Title: A Phase 1/2, Multicentre, Open-label, and Dose-escalation Study of ACP-196 in Subjects with 
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, Richter’s Syndrome or Prolymphocytic Leukemia.  
This is an ongoing Phase1/2, multicentre, open-label, nonrandomized, sequential group, dose-
escalation study designed to evaluate the safety, PK, and pharmacodynamics of acalabrutinib in 
subjects with CLL/SLL, Richter’s syndrome, or PLL. The study enrolled 306 subjects at 12 centres in the 
US, UK, and Italy; 301 subjects received study treatment. The primary objectives were to establish the 
safety and the maximum tolerated dose of orally administered acalabrutinib in subjects with CLL/SLL, 
and to determine the PK of orally administered acalabrutinib and identify its major metabolite. The 
secondary objective was to evaluate tumour response by ORR, DOR, and PFS. In the Phase 1 portion 
of the study, subjects with CLL and SLL received acalabrutinib at once daily (QD) doses of 100 mg, 175 
mg, 250 mg and 400 mg, and BID doses of 100 mg and 200 mg, for 28 days (1 cycle).  
Radiologic tumour assessment was done at screening and at the end of Cycles 2, 4, and 6; then every 
6 cycles until Cycle 36; and then every 12 cycles thereafter. Tumour response was assessed by the 
investigator based on IWCLL 2008 criteria per Hallek et al. 2008 with incorporation of the clarification 
for treatment-related lymphocytosis per Cheson et al. 2012. Confirmation of CR required bone marrow 
analysis and radiologic tumour assessment. 
No dose-limiting toxicities were observed in the Phase 1 dose escalation portion of the study, and the 
maximum tolerated dose was not reached at doses up to 400 mg QD. 
In R/R subjects, ORR for the Efficacy Evaluable Population (N=130) was 90.8% (95% CI: 84.4, 95.1), 
including 6 subjects (4.6%) with CR and 112 subjects (86.2%) with PR. For subjects with 17p deletion, 
ORR was 92.3% (95% CI: 74.9, 99.1).  
In previously untreated subjects, ORR for the Efficacy Evaluable Population (N=97) was 99.0% (95% 
CI: 94.4, 100), including 5 subjects (5.2%) with CR and 91 subjects (93.8%) with PR. For subjects 
with 17p deletion, the ORR was 100% (95% CI: 66.4, 100).  
The median time to initial response for the responders was 4.7 months (range: 1.6–43.7 months) in 
R/R subjects and 3.7 months (range: 1.7-22.1 months) in previously untreated subjects.  
With a median follow-up of 41.7 months (range: 0.56-58.48 months) in the R/R subjects and 45.6 
months (range: 0.92-52.34 months) in the previously untreated subjects, the median DOR for the 
Efficacy Evaluable Population in both the R/R and previously untreated subgroups was not reached.

Using KM point estimates, 58.1% (R/R) and 92.3% (previously untreated) of subjects were event-free 
at 48 months. 
These single-arm data with long follow-up support retained activity in del 17p disease, although 
number of subjects are limited; 9 in the previously untreated group and 24 in the r/r group. Regarding 
duration of response no medians (overall or for the del 17p subgroup) were reached for the previously 
untreated group or overall for the r/r group but was 31 months in the del 17p subgroup of the latter. 
Thus, del 17p disease may be associated with shorter DOR also when treated with acalabrutinib but 
longer follow-up is needed. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The application rests on two pivotal trials in two different populations. In previously untreated CLL trial 
ACE-CL-007 was a Randomized, Multicentre, Open-Label, 3 Arm Phase 3 Study of Obinutuzumab 
in Combination with Chlorambucil, ACP-196 in Combination with Obinutuzumab, and ACP- 196 
Monotherapy in Subjects with Previously Untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia. The study enrolled 
previously untreated subjects who were unfit based on the inclusion criterion of age ≥65 years or age 
<65 years with a Cumulative Illness Rating Score Geriatric (CIRS-G) score of >6 or a creatinine 
clearance of 30-69 mL/min (using the Cockcroft-Gault equation). 
In Relapsed or refractory CLL trial ACE-CL-309 was a Randomized, Multicentre, Open-Label, Phase 3 
Study of Acalabrutinib (ACP-196) Versus Investigator’s Choice of Either Idelalisib Plus Rituximab or 
Bendamustine Plus Rituximab in Subjects with Relapsed or Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia. 
Subjects were required to have received ≥1 prior systemic therapy for CLL to be eligible to enrol. Prior 
exposure to a B-cell lymphoma (BCL)-2 inhibitor (e.g., venetoclax/ABT-199) or a B-cell receptor (BCR) 
inhibitor (e.g., BTK inhibitors or PI3K inhibitors) was not allowed. 
An active comparator has been chosen for each study. In ACE-CL-007 in subjects with previously 
untreated CLL, acalabrutinib+obinutuzumab as well as acalabrutinib monotherapy were compared with 
obinutuzumab+chlorambucil. Obinutuzumab+Chlorambucil is one of the standard treatments for low 
risk patients or patient with comorbidities, thus the chosen comparator is supported for unfit patients. 
Other options as for first line treatment are ibrutinib, FCR (Rituximab-Fludarabine and 
cyclophosphamide) for patients < 65 years or Rituximab–Bendamustine (R-B) for patients ≥65 years. 
However, in presence of TP53 mutation or del(17p) ibrutinib had been the preferred choice. 
In ACE-CL-309 in subjects with R/R CLL, acalabrutinib monotherapy was compared with investigator’s 
choice of idelalisib+rituximab (IR) or bendamustine+rituximab (BR), as BR is mostly used as first line, 
idelalisib –Rituximab or ibrutinitb are mostly used in R/R CLL. Even when the proposed active 
comparators are supported, it would be ideally preferred a direct comparison to the standard BTK 
inhibitor ibrutinib. Additionally, for the indication in R/R CLL the main drawback of the control arm 
being the doctor's choice makes the results of this group more heterogeneous than desirable.  
At both studies, a crossover period has been proposed at investigator discretion for those patients not 
receiving acalabrutinib, once progression has been confirmed by IRC, to receive treatment with single-
agent acalabrutinib at 100 mg BID until next disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. This cross-
over will have an impact on the survival outcomes comparison. 
For both studies primary efficacy endpoint was based on IRC assessment of PFS per IWCLL criteria 
(Hallek et al. 2008) with incorporation of the clarification for treatment-related lymphocytosis (Cheson 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/458179/2020  
Page 115/147 
 
 
 
et al. 2012). Even when the choice of primary endpoint seems adequate, a clarification by the 
applicant about the applied “IWCLL criteria (Hallek et al. 2008) with incorporation of the clarification 
for treatment-related lymphocytosis (Cheson et al. 2012)” would be acknowledged. From the statistical 
assessment point of view the applicant split α into α1 and α2 for interim and final analyses. Secondary 
endpoints were tested in a hierarchical order separately for interim and final analyses. It is however 
noting that since the test of ORR between acalabrutinib monotherapy and obinutuzumab+chlorambucil 
was not statistically significant (p=0.0763), it will not be possible to formally test OS in the final 
analysis. 
Sensitivity analysis for PFS as assessed by IRC without censoring for subsequent anticancer therapy 
were performed. The performed sensitivity analysis for subsequent anticancer therapy differed from 
what was specified in the SAP. An additional analysis for PFS without censoring for subsequent 
anticancer and without censoring of events after 2 or more consecutively missed visits (i.e. combining 
sensitivity analyses with numbers 2 and 3 in the company’s documentation) has been provided and 
supports the robustness of the primary outcome. 
The number of patients that were randomised but not treated were more frequent in the control arm, 
Arm A (8/177, 4.5%) than in acalabrutinib combination arm, Arm B (0/179, 0%) and in acalabrutinib 
monotherapy Arm C (1/179, 0.6%). In the control arm one patient did not fulfil the inclusion criteria 
and two died before treatment start. The other 5 dropped out of other reasons. The study was open 
label, and knowledge of the allocated treatment may have affected the dropout rate. The applicant has 
provided a sensitivity analysis for PFS, arm A vs B, where the patients that did not fulfil the inclusion 
criteria and the two that died before treatment start were excluded, and where the 5 other patients 
who dropped out were analysed as if they were followed without event until end of study. The results 
of this analysis were generally consistent with what was observed in the primary analysis. 
Updated results reported for both pivotal studies are based on pre-specified interim analyses and data 
cutoff date of 08 February 2019 for study 007 and 15 January 2019 for study 309. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In previously untreated CLL (study 007), with a median-follow up of 28 months and an event rate 
of 52% in the control arm IRC-assessed PFS for Acala+Obin vs clb+obi, the primary outcome, showed 
a HR of 0.10 [95% CI: 0.06, 0.17]; p<0.0001, in favour of the Acala+Obin arm. The sensitivity 
analyses are supportive of this outcome. The median estimated PFS for the experimental arm was not 
reached; the median estimated PFS for the control arm was 22.6 months (95%CI: 20.2, 27.6). In 
terms of HR for PFS, the subgroup analyses consistently favour the experimental arm.  
With a median-follow up and event rate for the control arm as above, IRC-assessed PFS for 
acalabrutinib monotherapy vs clb+obi, the key alpha-controlled secondary outcome, showed a HR of 
0.20 [95% CI: 0.13, 0.30]; p<0.0001 in favour of the experimental arm. The sensitivity analyses are 
supportive of this outcome. The median estimated PFS for acalabrutinib monotherapy was not reached; 
the median estimated PFS for the control arm was 22.6 months (95%CI: 20.2, 27.6). In terms of HR 
for PFS, the point estimates for the subgroup analyses consistently numerically favour the 
acalabrutinib monotherapy arm.  
The IRC-assessed ORR for Acala+Obin, acalabrutinib monotherapy, and the control arm was 93.9% 
(95% CI: 89.3–96.5), 85.5% (95% CI: 79.6–89.9), and 78.5% (95% CI: 71.9–83.9), respectively. As 
expected for a BTK inhibitor, the fraction of subjects reaching CR was less than 1% in the acalabrutinib 
monotherapy arm and not higher than 13% in the Acala+Obin combination arm. The ORR difference 
between Acala+Obin and the control arm was 15.3% (95% CI: 8.3–22.3), p<0.0001; the difference 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/458179/2020  
Page 116/147 
 
 
 
between the acalabrutinib monotherapy arm and the control arm was not statistically significant, 
meaning that the downstream secondary endpoints in the hierarchy are only nominally reported. 
Although the subgroup analyses generally are consistent with the overall outcome, some analyses are 
of special interest, particularly regarding del 17p/TP53 mutation y/n: The activity of the acalabrutinib 
combination is slightly higher in the del17p/TP53 mutation-negative subgroup (95% vs 84% in the 
positive subgroup), while similar for the subgroups with acalabrutinib monotherapy where the activity 
corresponds to the activity of the acalabrutinib combination in the del17p/TP53 mutation-positive 
subgroup. The ORR of the control regimen is roughly similar to what is noted with acalabrutinib 
monotherapy in the negative subgroup but considerably lower than both experimental arms in positive 
disease, 56%. 
The time to next treatment was numerically prolonged compared with control for both Acala+Obin 
(HR=0.14 [95% CI: 0.08–0.26]) and acalabrutinib monotherapy (HR=0.24 [95% CI: 0.15–0.40]). The 
median time to next treatment was not reached for any treatment arm. 
With an event rate of only 10% in the control arm, and 5% in the Acala+Obin arm and 6% in the 
monotherapy arm, data on OS is, as expected for a first-line treatment of CLL with a median of 28 
months of follow-up, immature. In addition, the massive cross-over from the control arm to 
acalabrutinib monotherapy makes relative OS data practically non-interpretable. Nevertheless, a HR of 
0.47 (0.21, 1.06) is reported for the acalabrutinib combination vs control, and a HR of 0.60 (0.28, 
1.27) for acalabrutinib monotherapy vs control, both in favour of the experimental regimens.   
Study enrolment in the 007 study (previously untreated patients) was restricted to subjects ≥65 years 
of age or younger with comorbidity. As an indication encompassing the whole population is sought 
extrapolation was discussed and considered acceptable (see also discussion on Benefit / risk). 
With the possible exception of biased early censoring of limited size in the control arm (6% vs 0.6% in 
the Acala+Obin arm and 3% in the acalabrutinib monotherapy arm) in this open study, no worrisome 
censoring is noted.  
Inspection of the KM curves shows that the down-flection of the control arm starts some months after 
cessation of therapy. This is not surprising and emphasises the need for data on OS/PFS2. Given the 
massive cross-over from the control arm robust data on OS will never be achieved. 
Comparing Acala+Obin vs Clb+Obin, notably, the point estimate for PFS HR is similar (0.1) for subjects 
with (25 subjects in each arm) or without (154 in the experimental arm and 152 in the control arm) 
del 17p or TP53 mutation. This might be surprising considering the suboptimal control regimen 
Clb+Obin for subjects with these genomic aberrations, but numbers are low. Expanding the analysis to 
encompass subjects with all genetic high-risk features (del 17p, TP53 mutation, del 11q and/or 
unmutated IGHV; n=117 in the experimental arm and 129 in the control arm) the corresponding point 
estimate is 0.08 vs 0.22 in the complementary group.  
When comparing acalabrutinib monotherapy vs Clb+Obin, as noted for the primary analysis comparing 
Acala+Obin vs Clb+Obin, the PFS HR for subjects with del 17p or TP53 mutated disease (n=23 
subjects in the experimental arm and 25 in the control arm) is approximately the same as for the 
complementary group. A numerically substantial difference between the groups is however noted when 
mutational status of IGHV and all genetic high-risk features together (as defined above) are 
considered.  
In Relapsed or refractory CLL (study 309) with a median-follow up of 16 months and an event rate 
of only 44% in the control arm IRC-assessed PFS showed a HR of 0.31 [95% CI: 0.20, 0.49]; 
p<0.0001, in favour of the experimental arm. The median estimated PFS for the experimental arm was 
not reached; the median estimated PFS for the control arm was 16.5 months (95%CI: 14.0, 17.1).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/458179/2020  
Page 117/147 
 
 
 
The performed sensitivity analyses are supportive of the primary outcome. The subgroup analyses 
consistently favour the experimental arm. It is noted that the point estimate for PFS HR is 0.21 for the 
subgroup of subjects with del 17p or TP53 mutation (n=87) while 0.36 in the complementary group. 
With an event rate of 44% in the control arm, similar as for the primary analysis, the HR for 
investigator-assesses PFS, a secondary endpoint, was 0.28 (0.18, 0.45), p <0.0001, and thus 
consistent with the primary analysis.  
With the possible exception of biased early censoring of limited size in the control arm (6% vs 0.6% in 
the Acala+Obin arm and 3% in the acalabrutinib monotherapy arm) in this open study, no worrisome 
censoring is noted. A sensitivity analysis showed results generally consistent with was observed in the 
primary analysis.  
Inspection of the KM curves shows that the down-flection of the control arm starts some months after 
cessation of therapy. This is not surprising and emphasises the need for data on OS/PFS2. Given the 
massive cross-over from the control arm robust data on OS will never be achieved. 
In terms of ORR, and ORR including partial response with lymphocytosis, no statistically significant 
difference between study arms was noted, neither per IRC nor per investigator. The ORR per IRC was 
81% in the experimental arm, with no subject reaching CR or CRi. As expected for a BTK inhibitor the 
activity was retained, and numerically higher than for the control, in subjects with del 17p or TP53 
mutation. As the ORR by IRC did not reach statistical significance the downstream outcomes are only 
nominally reported. 
With a median follow-up of around 16 months event rates for OS were low, 12% in the control arm 
and 10% in the experimental arm. HR was 0.84 (0.42, 1.66). 
Given the low maturity at the time of this interim analysis in study 309, performed in January 2019, an 
update of the primary and the time-dependent analyses was requested and with 6 months longer 
follow-up, and an acceptable PFS maturity of 58% in the control arm, outcomes remain essentially 
stable. 
Patients previously treated with ibrutinib or venetoclax were excluded from the r/r CLL study. While 
treatment with acalabrutinib would be considered irrational after progression under or after ibrutinib 
drug pressure, it is unknown whether prior exposure to venetoclax might impact response to 
acalabrutinib. The applicant presented external data reasonably supporting the use of BTK inhibitors in 
subjects previously treated with venetoclax, and the use of acalabrutinib in subjects intolerant, but not 
resistant, to ibrutinib. This is in line with what could mechanistically be expected. 
Updated results (cut-off 1 August 2019) based on investigator’s assessment: With a median follow-up 
of 22.1 months (range: 0.53-29.11) in the acalabrutinib arm and 21.9 months (range: 0.03-27.73) in 
the IR/BR arm, and event rates of 58% in the control arm and 23% in the experimental arm, the PFS 
HR was 0.27 [95% CI: 0.18, 0.40]; p<0.0001. The outcome is supported by the performed sensitivity 
analyses. The median estimated PFS for acalabrutinib was not reached; the median estimated PFS for 
IR/BR was 16.8 months (95% CI: 14.1, 22.4). 
With 6 months longer follow-up, and an acceptable PFS maturity of 58% in the control arm, outcomes 
remain essentially stable.   
With a median follow-up of around 16 months event rates for OS were low, 12% in the control arm 
and 10% in the experimental arm. HR was 0.84 (0.42, 1.66). At the updated analysis, with a median 
follow-up of 22 months and 21 events in the acalabrutinib arm and 26 events in the control arm, HR 
was 0.78 (0.44, 1.40).

Per IRC assessment, the median duration of response was 13.6 months in the control arm and not 
reached in the experimental arm; HR 0.33 (0.19, 0.59); at the updated analysis using investigator-
assessed DOR, the corresponding figures were 18 months, not reached, 0.19 (0.11, 0.33) 
Based on event fractions of 34% in the control arm, including cross-over (23%), and 14% in the 
experimental arm, the median time to next treatment was not reached for any of the study arms. The 
HR was 0.35 (0.21, 0.58). The median time from first dose to subsequent anticancer therapy was 10 
months in the experimental arm. At the updated analysis, the HR was 0.30 (0.20, 0.46). 
Further, in terms of HR for PFS, the subgroup analyses consistently favour the experimental arm. 
Notably, the point estimate for PFS HR is similar (0.1) for subjects with (25 subjects in each arm) or 
without (154 in the experimental arm and 152 in the control arm) del 17p or TP53 mutation. This 
might be surprising considering the suboptimal control regimen for subjects with these genomic 
aberrations, but numbers are low. Expanding the analysis to encompass subjects with all genetic high-
risk features (del 17p, TP53 mutation, del 11q and/or unmutated IGHV; n=117 in the experimental 
arm and 129 in the control arm) the corresponding point estimate is 0.08 vs 0.22 in the 
complementary group. The control regimen, Clb+Obin, is deemed suboptimal for subjects with del 
17p/TP53 mutation, even at the time of study initiation (September 2015).  
The applicant has provided compiled absolute data on PFS and ORR with DOR per treatment arm and 
genetic risk status (del 17p or TP53-mutation vs the complementary group). These data suggest that 
also the acalabrutinib-containing study arms performed numerically inferior in subjects with del 17p or 
TP53 mutation-positive disease. The applicant’s justification for the use of chl+obi in the control arm, 
alluding to historical reasons, is acknowledged and accepted. 
In study 309 censoring is higher in the control arm during the first 9 months, it was argued that the 
higher frequency of study treatment discontinuation in the control arm contributed to the observed 
unevenly distributed censoring time the differing censoring pattern between study arms beyond 9 
months. Bias in terms of informative censoring beyond the first 9 months of the study does not seem 
to confound the outcomes. With the possible exception of biased early censoring of limited size, as 
discussed above, possibly also influencing the higher fraction of “no post-baseline assessment” in the 
control arm (6 vs 0.6%), no worrisome censoring is noted. Inspection of the KM curves shows that the 
down-flection of the control arm starts some months after cessation of therapy. This is not surprising 
and emphasises the need for data on OS/PFS2.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Calquence (acalabrutinib) has demonstrated efficacy in terms of PFS and supportive secondary 
endpoints both as monotherapy and in combination with obinutuzumab in patients with previously 
untreated or having received at least 1 prior treatment for CLL.  
The final Clinical study reports for studies ACE-CL-007 (including data on time to second subsequent 
therapy) and ACE-CL-309 are expected to be submitted by Q3 2022 (see RMP) as post approval data.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The assessment of safety of acalabrutinib is based two pivotal studies presented separately, ACE-CL-
007 performed in treatment naïve CLL subjects (elderly or patients with comorbidities) and ACE CL-
309, in R/R CLL subjects (subjects were required to have received ≥1 prior systemic therapy for CLL). 
The MAH also presents safety data as integrated analysis of pooled safety data from, in total, 10 open-

Page 119/147 
 
 
 
 
label efficacy and safety studies, (phase 1 to phase 3) in subjects with hematologic malignancies 
treated with acalabrutinib, including the two pivotal studies.  
Both studies are ongoing, and the present application presents pre planned interim analyses for the 
respective pivotal study.  
The safety population consists of all subjects who received any amount of study drug. 
The 10 studies include the following: 
- 
- 
- 
Two Phase 3 pivotal studies in R/R CLL (ACE-CL-309) and previously untreated CLL (ACE-CL-
007) 
Three supportive CLL studies evaluating acalabrutinib monotherapy (15-H-0016 and ACE-CL-
001) and acalabrutinib+obinutuzumab (ACE CL 003) 
Five supportive studies evaluating acalabrutinib monotherapy in other hematologic 
malignancies (ACE-LY-002 [activated B-cell diffuse large B-cell lymphoma], ACE LY 003 
[follicular lymphoma], ACE-LY-004 [mantle cell lymphoma], ACE MY 001 [multiple myeloma] 
and ACE WM 001 [Waldenström macroglobulinemia]) 
The data from these 10 studies were analysed in 5 analysis pools as follows: 
-  Mono Pivotals (N=333): This population consists of all subjects from CLL pivotal studies (ACE-
CL-007 and ACE-CL-309) who received at least 1 dose of acalabrutinib monotherapy. 
-  Mono CLL (N=762): This population consists of subjects from CLL pivotal studies (ACE CL-007 
and ACE-CL-309) and CLL supportive studies (ACE-CL-001 and 15 H 0016) who received at 
least 1 dose of acalabrutinib monotherapy including subjects who crossed over from any 
control arm. 
-  Combo CLL (N=223): This population consists of subjects from Studies ACE CL 007 and ACE-
CL-003 who received at least 1 dose of combination therapy of acalabrutinib and 
obinutuzumab. 
- 
Total CLL (N=985): This population consists of subjects from Mono CLL and Combo CLL 
populations described above. 
-  Mono HemMalig (N=1040): This population consists of subjects from all hematologic 
malignancy studies in which subjects received at least 1 dose of acalabrutinib monotherapy 
including subjects who crossed over from any control arm. 
Patient exposure 
Pivotal study ACE-CL-007 
The median duration of exposure to acalabrutinib was 27.7 months (range: 0.7–40.3 months) in the 
acalabrutinib+obinutuzumab (Acala+Obin) arm and 27.7 months (range 0.3–40.2 months) in the 
acalabrutinib monotherapy (Acala-mono) arm, with 83.1% and 81.0% of subjects in the 2 arms, 
respectively, receiving ≥2 years of acalabrutinib therapy. The median duration of obinutuzumab 
treatment was 5.5 months (range: 0.9–7.1 months) in the Acala+Obin arm and 5.6 months (range: 
0.9–7.4 months) in the chlorambucil+obinutuzumab (Clb+Obin) arm. The median duration of 
chlorambucil treatment was 5.5 months (range: 0.5–7.2 months) in the Clb+Obin arm.  
The median relative dose intensity was in the two Acala containing arms >98 %.  
Pivotal study ACE-CL-309 
The median duration of monotherapy acalabrutinib treatment was 15.7 months (range: 1.1-22.4 
months) with 85.7% of subjects receiving ≥1 year of therapy. In the idelalisib+rituximab (IR) group, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/458179/2020  
Page 120/147 
 
 
 
the median duration of idelalisib treatment was 11.5 months (range: 0.1-21.1 months) and the median 
duration of rituximab was 5.5 months (range: 0.9-8.5 months). In the bendamustine+rituximab (BR) 
group, the median duration of bendamustine treatment was 5.6 months (range: 1.0-7.1 months) and 
the median duration of rituximab treatment was 5.5 months (range: 0.9-7.1 months).  
The median dose intensity of acalabrutinib was 99.5%. 
Pooled populations 
Median durations of exposure for the different pools ranged from 19.3 to 29.8 months. Median duration 
of exposure to acalabrutinib in Mono HemMalig population was 24.6 months and in ComboCLL 
(combination with obinutuzumab) 29.8 month. 
In summary, the acalabrutinib exposure presents altogether sufficient data for safety assessment. 
Data on exposure has been presented for several time intervals and most patients in all five pools were 
exposed to acalabrutinib for >12 months. Together with the high relative dose intensity, i.e. > 98%, 
this indicates an acceptable tolerability. 
The safety database includes CLL subjects covering the proposed target population, possibly with a 
retrenchment in a younger, treatment naïve, fit population. However, there is little diffidence of worse 
outcome, with respect to safety, in this subgroup. 
At the time of data cut-off, >88% of the subjects in Mono Pivotal and Combo CLL, were still on 
treatment.  
From here on, pooled data reported will only be those collected from the Mono Pivotal and Combo CLL 
populations. 
Adverse events 
ACE-CL-007 
In the Acala-Obin arm the most frequent (>20%) TEAEs were (by PT) headache (39.9%), diarrhea 
(38.8%), neutropenia (31.5%), fatigue (28.1%), contusion (23.6%), arthralgia (21.9%), cough 
(21.9%), upper respiratory tract infection (21.3%), and nausea (20.2%). All of these frequent AEs 
were Grade 1 or 2, with the exception of neutropenia. 
In the Acala-mono arm the most frequent TEAEs were headache (36.9%), diarrhea (34.6%), and 
nausea (22.3%). Almost all of these frequent TEAEs were Grade 1 or 2, with the exception of 2 
subjects (1.1%) with Grade 3 TEAEs of headache and 1 subject (0.6%) with a Grade 3 TEAE of 
diarrhea. None of these frequent TEAEs were Grade 4. 
In the Clb+Obin arm the most frequent TEAEs were neutropenia (45.0%), infusion related reaction 
(39.6%), nausea (31.4%), diarrhea (21.3%), and pyrexia (20.7%). Most of these frequent TEAEs were 
Grade 1 or 2, with the exception of neutropenia (Grade ≥3, 41%).

Treatment-Emergent CTCAE Grade ≥3 Adverse Events Reported in ≥2% of Subjects in Any 
Treatment Arm (Safety Population, ACE-CL-007)
ACE-CL-309 
The treatment in the Acala arm in ACE-CL-309 was continued until PD or unacceptable toxicity while 
the IR received idelalisib until PD or unacceptable toxicity but rituximab for 6 cycles. The BR group 
received maximum 6 cycles of both drugs. The actual median time on treatment at DCO for Acala was 
(15.7 months), for idelalisib treatment was 11.5 months and for Clb+Obin 5.6 months.  
The most common TEAEs among subjects treated with monotherapy acalabrutinib, (≥10% of subjects) 
were: headache (22.1%), neutropenia (19.5%), diarrhoea (18.2%), anaemia and cough (14.9% 
each), upper respiratory tract infection (14.3%), pyrexia (12.3%), thrombocytopenia (11.0%) and 
pneumonia and respiratory tract infection (10.4% each). The majority of these TEAEs were Grade 1 or 
2. One subject in the acalabrutinib group had febrile neutropenia Grade ≥3. 
In the IR group, the most common TEAEs (≥10% of subjects) were: diarrhoea (46.6%), neutropenia 
(44.9%), pyrexia (17.8%), cough (15.3%), upper respiratory tract infection (14.4%), 
thrombocytopenia and rash (13.6% each), nausea (12.7%), and pneumonia and increased alanine 
aminotransferase (11.9% each). Most of these AEs were Grade 1 or 2. 
In the BR group, the most common TEAEs (≥10% of subjects) were: neutropenia (34.3%), fatigue, 
and infusion-related reaction (22.9% each), nausea (20.0%), pyrexia (17.1%), constipation, 
diarrhoea, and thrombocytopenia (14.3% each), and anaemia and upper respiratory tract infection 
(11.4% each). Most of these AEs were Grade 1 or 2.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
ACE-CL-007 
Out of the 33 deaths (6.3%) recorded in the ACE-CL-007 study until DCO, there were 4, 6 and 10 
death due to AE in the Acala+Obin, Acala-mono and Clb+Obin arm, respectively. No Grade 5 
TEAE/fatal by PT occurred in more than 1 subject, except for Grade 5 events of sepsis (2 [(1.1%]) in 
the Acala+Obin arm, however, not considered related to treatment. AE Grade 5/fatal outcome that 
occurred beyond the treatment-emergent period (>30 days after the last study treatment) occurred at 
the highest rate in the Clb+Obin arm and a higher rate in the Acala mono arm than in the Acala+Obin 
arm. Two deaths occurred in the crossover population, 1 death due to Richter’s transformation (>30 
days of last acalabrutinib dose) and the other was due to the TEAE of acute myocardial infarction 
(within 30 days of last acalabrutinib dose).  
The frequency of patients with ≥ 1 SAE any grade was highest in the Acala+Obin combination arm, 
with focus on SOC infection and infestations. However, SAE Grade ≥3 was in the same range in the 2 
acalabrutinib containing arms, 32% and 29%, compared to 19% in the Clb+Obin arm. PT Grade ≥3 
Febrile neutropenia (4.1%), was most notable in the Clb+Obin arm, as were tumor lysis syndrome 
(TLS, 4.7%). SAE TLS occurred in ≤1% in the 2 acalabrutinib containing arms, which is in the same 
range as for the approved BTK inhibitor (Imbruvica SmPC). 
ACE-CL-309 
Fifteen (9.7%) subjects who received acalabrutinib and 18 (11.8%) subjects who received IR or BR 
had died as of the DCO, including 3 subjects in the IR group who died after crossover to acalabrutinib 
treatment. The most common primary cause of death in all treatment groups was AEs, however, AEs 
as primary cause of death was less frequent in the Acala-mono arm. PD as primary cause of death was 
more common in the Acala-mono group; 5 (3.2%), whereof 4/5 (2.6%) during the period beyond 30 
days after last dose of study drug, which contrasted with the IR/BR arm, where no deaths due to PD

occurred during the studied period. However, deaths due to Richter’s transformation occurred > 30 
days after last dose of study drug in the IR/BR arm in 3/1 subjects. 
SAEs occurred in 28.6%, 55.9%, and 25.7% of subjects who received Acala, IR, and BR, respectively, 
and most SAEs were Grade ≥3. The rate of SAEs resolved/unresolved in the different study arms, 
needs to be clarified. Among subjects treated with Acala, the most common SAE was pneumonia (8 
subjects [5.2%]). Among subjects treated with IR, the most common SAEs were diarrhoea (16 
[13.6%] subjects), pneumonia (10 [8.5%] subjects), pyrexia (8 [6.8%] subjects), anaemia (4 
[3.4%]), and colitis and pneumococcal pneumonia (3 [2.5%] each). Among subjects treated with BR, 
no SAE occurred in ≥1 subject. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
The following Events of Clinical Interest (ECIs) have been identified based on nonclinical findings, 
emerging data from clinical studies relating to acalabrutinib, and pharmacological effects of approved 
BTK inhibitor. The AEs selected for dedicated analysis were evaluated using Standardized MedDRA 
Queries (SMQs), where available, by SOC, or by sponsor-defined baskets of MedDRA Adverse Event 
Grouped Terms. The definition of ECIs are identical for study ACE-CL-007 and study ACE-CL-309 and 
therefor also used for the pooled populations. 
Patients with significant cardiovascular disease were excluded from the pivotal studies. 
ACE-CL-007 
Cardiac events (any grade) were reported in the same fequency,14.0%, in both the Acala+Obin arm 
and the Acala-mono arm. Cardiac events (any grade) in the Clb+Obin arm were reported at a lower 
frequency than in either of the Acala arms, 7.7%. 
TEAE Atrial fibrillation (any grade) was recorded in 3.4% and 3.9% of the patients in the Acala+Obin 
and the Acala-mono arm, respectively. In the Clb+Obin arm, atrial fibrillation was recorded only in 1 
patient (0.6%).   
Other cardiac events occurred in 11.8%, 12.8% and 7.7% in the Acala+Obin, Acala-mono and 
Clb+Obin treatment arms, respectively. PT Myocardial infarction (inclusive PT acute myocardial 
infarction) Grade ≥3 occurred in 3 subjects in the Acala+Obin arm, 4 subjects in the Acala-mono arm 
and 1 subject in the Clb+Obin arm. Except for cardiac failure in 2 patients in the Acala-mono arm, no 
other cardiac event occurred more than in 1 patient in any treatment arm.  
ACE-CL-309 
Cardiac events were reported more often in the Acala arm, 13.0%, compared to IR 7.6% or BR 8.6%. 
Grade ≥3 cardiac events were reported with similar frequency in the Acala and the IR groups, 3.2% 
and 3.8%, respectively. All cardiac events in the BR group, 8.6%, were of Grade ≥3.  
The most common cardiac event by PT was atrial fibrillation, reported in 8 (5.2%, 2 were Grade 3), 3 
(2.5%) and 1 (2.9%; Grade 3) subjects in the Acala, IR, and BR treatment groups, respectively. None 
of the atrial fibrillation events lead to study drug discontinuation.   
Other cardiac events occurred in 9.7%, 5.9% and 5.7% in the acalabrutinib, IR, and BR treatment 
groups, respectively. 
In the Acala treatment arm, 6 subjects had SAEs of cardiac events. Three SAEs of atrial fibrillation, one 
a Grade 3 angina unstable and one Grade 3 acute coronary syndrome, both reported as related to 
acalabrutinib and the sixth patients had a SAE of Grade 4 cardiac arrest (reported as not related). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/458179/2020  
Page 124/147 
 
 
 
Among subjects who received IR, 4 subjects had SAEs of cardiac events and among subjects who 
received BR, 3 subjects had SAEs of cardiac events. 
Pooled populations: The rate of any grade cardiac events (SOC cardiac disorders) occurred at a slightly 
increased in Mono HemMalig, 15.6% and Combo CLL 19.7%, possibly due to, in part, inclusion of a 
different study population in the added studies. However, atrial fibrillation occurred at the same level 
as reported for the pivotal Acala arms, Mono HemMalig (4.5%) and Combo CLL (4.5%). The time from 
first acalabrutinib dose to onset of atrial fibrillation event ranged from 8 to 1280 days, with a median 
onset of 521.5 days for subjects in Mono HemMalig.  
Regarding other BTK inhibitors, a risk of cardiac arrhythmia, including atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter 
and cases of ventricular tachyarrhytmia have been reported in patients treated with ibrutinib. 
However, no causal relationship between acalabrutinib and cardiac arythmias, other than atrial 
fibrillation/flutter, can be established and since no significant effects were observed in ECG with 
acalabrutinib in a QT/QTc study, ventricular fibrillation can be monitored with routine 
pharmacovigilance activities.  
Hypertension 
ACE-CL-007  
Hypertension events (any grade) were infrequent and occurred in 7.3% in the Acala+Obin arm, 4.5% 
in the Acala-mono arm and 6 subjects 3.6% in the Clb+Obin arm. Grade 3 hypertension was seen in 
2.8%, 2.2% and 3.9% subjects in the Acala+Obin, Acala-mono and Clb+Obin treatment arms, 
respectively and no Grade 4 or 5 events occurred.  
ACE-CL-309 
Hypertension events were equally infrequent in the pivotal study ACE-CL-309. Hypertension (all 
grades) occurred in 3.2%, 4.2% and 0 subjects treated with Acala, IR or BR, respectively. Three 
subjects treated with acalabrutinib and 1 subject treated with IR had Grade 3 hypertension. 
Pooled populations: In the Mono HemMalig pool frequency of hypertension 7.1% of the patients 
reported with hypertension any grade, Grade ≥3, 3.5%. A higher frequency was reported in the 
Combo CLL pool, 12.6% and Grade ≥3, 3.6%. For the presently only approved BTK where 
hypertension is reported (Imbruvica SmPC) with a prevalence increasing for every year of exposure. 
Presented data on hypertension from the large pool of patients treated with acalabrutinib monotherapy 
(MonoHemMalig pool), does not indicate, so far, that continuous exposure (<12 months, >12 months 
< 24 months or >24 months <36 months) to acalabrutinib is accompanied with an increased risk for 
hypertension. 
Haematology/cytopenia 
ACE-CL-007 
The acalabrutinib containing arms, in general, had less events of cytopenia compared to the Clb+Obin 
arm. However, the addition of Obin to Acala increased the frequency of cytopenia compared to Acala 
alone. Neutropenia all grades occurred at the highest rate in the Clb+Obin arm (49.1%) and the rates 
were 33.1% and 11.7% the Acala+Obin arm and Acala-mono arm respectively. Almost all events were 
Grade ≥3. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/458179/2020  
Page 125/147 
 
 
 
ACE-CL-309 
Leukopenia was the most frequently reported category of cytopenia in all 3 treatment groups, with a 
lower occurrence in subjects treated with acalabrutinib (21.4%) than IR (53.4%) or BR (37.1%). 
Neutropenia events (including PTs neutropenia, decreased neutrophil count, and febrile neutropenia) 
stood for almost all reported Leukopenia events. The almost double rate of neutropenia in the 
acalabrutinib arm in ACE-CL-307, compared to the Acala-mono of ACE-CL-007, can be explained by 
the study population, i.e. previously treated CLL patients.  
In the acalabrutinib arm 17.5% was Grade ≥3 neutropenia events including 11 subjects with Grade 4 
events. There was no Grade 5 neutropenia event, and no neutropenia events led to discontinuation of 
acalabrutinib. 
In subjects treated with IR, Grade ≥3 neutropenia events occurred in 55 (46.6% plus 3 subjects with 
PT granulocytopenia) and in the BR group 12 (34.3%) subjects. Among subjects in the IR/BR arm, 3 
subjects had SAEs of neutropenia or febrile neutropenia.  
According to information provided by the applicant, in both pivotal trials, almost all patients with TEAEs 
Grade≥3 of anaemia (5.6%, 6.7% in the Acala+Obin and Acala mono arm in 007 and 11.7% in the 
Acala mono arm in 309) received transfusions and/or EPO for the management of the AE anemia. 
Pooled populations: In the Mono HemMalig population the rates of anemia, neutropenia and 
thrombocytopenia were reported in 13.8%, 15.7%, and 8.9%, respectively. Out of these, 7.8%, 
14.2%, and 4.8% were Grade ≥3. Of note, the rates of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in the 
ComboCLL population were notably higher. The applicant has clarified that also the recurrence rate of 
neutropenia grade ≥3 TEAE, was higher in the acalabrutinib + obinutuzumab combination arm 
compared to the acalabrutinib monotherapy arm (ACE-CL-007). The rate of G-CSF usage in subjects in 
with at least 1 Grade ≥3 TEAE was 46% and 37% respectively (combination vs monotherapy). 
The rate, of at least 1 Grade ≥3 TEAE of neutropenia in ACE-CL-309, in the acalabrutinib monotherapy 
arm (16%) and the rate of G-CSF usage in subjects in Study ACE-CL-309 with at least 1 Grade ≥3 
TEAE of neutropenia was 52.0%.  
Haemorrhage 
ACE-CL-007 
Haemorrhage (SMQ term) occurred in 42.7%, 39.1% and 11.8% in the Acala+Obin arm, Acala-mono 
arm and the Clb+Obin arm, respectively. The most frequent haemorrhage event was contusion (PT) 
23.5%, 15.1% and 4.1% in the three treatment arms respectively. The majority of haemorrhage event 
in Acala containing arms and all events in the Clb+Obin arm, were of Grade 1-2 and. Major 
haemorrhage Grade ≥3 occurred in 3 patients in each of the two acalabrutinib containing arms and no 
patient in the Clb+Obin arm. 
With respect to reported ischemic cerebrovascular event in study 007 (4 events) it has been difficult to 
reach a conclusion on the potential relationship with acalabrutinib treatment due to confounding 
factors. It is, therefore, proposed to include ischemic cerebrovascular events as an important potential 
risk in the RMP, to further characterise it.  
ACE-CL-309 
Haemorrhage events occurred more frequently in subjects who received acalabrutinib (26.0%) than in 
subjects who received IR (7.6%) or BR (5.7%). Grade ≥3 haemorrhage events occurred with similar 
frequency in subjects treated with acalabrutinib (1.9%), IR (2.5%), and BR (2.9%). Major 
Assessment report

haemorrhage events also occurred with similar frequency in the acalabrutinib, IR and BR treatment 
groups (1.9%, 2.5%, and 2.9%, respectively).  
The most common haemorrhage event by PT was contusion, reported in 13 subjects (8.4%) in the 
acalabrutinib treatment arm and 3 (2.5%) in IR treated subjects and none in the BR group. This was 
followed by PT haematoma in 5.8%, 1.7% and 2.9% in the acalabrutinib, IR and BR group 
respectively. 
The pattern of haemorrhage events in ACE-CL-007 is the same as in ACE-CL-309 but occurring at a 
clearly higher frequency in ACE-CL-007. The Acala median exposure time differs in the two pivotal 
studies (27.7 months vs 15.7 months). The question on incidence over time arises and data has been 
provided during the present round.  
Pooled populations: The frequency of haemorrhage events in Mono HemMalig was 46.3% and Combo 
CLL, 48.4%. In the Mono HemMalig population, the median time to onset for Grade ≥3 haemorrhage 
event was 174.0 days (range:4 to 1327 days). Major haemorrhage events were reported for Mono 
HemMalig in 3.6% and Combo CLL in 3.6%. Four (4) subjects had their study treatment permanently 
discontinued due to a haemorrhage event. All were assessed as related to acalabrutinib (3) or 
acalabrutinib and obinutuzumab (1), three were reported resolved and one continuous (ITP). The most 
frequently reported major haemorrhage was haematoma (n=5), followed by epistaxis and retinal 
haemorrhage (n=4 each), gastrointestinal haemorrhage (n=3), and gastric haemorrhage, haematuria, 
and intracranial haemorrhage (n=2 each). Other major haemorrhage events occurred in 1 subject 
each, including 4 events in the CNS (cerebral microhaemorrhage, intracranial haematoma, 
subarachnoid haemorrhage, and traumatic intracranial haemorrhage). 
Hepatotoxicity 
ACE-CL-007 
Since patients with AST/ALT >3.0 x ULN and total bilirubin >1.5 x ULN were excluded from study ACE-
CL-007 no subject entered the study with significant hepatic impairment, no analysis on TEAEs by 
baseline hepatic function is feasible. 
With respect to ALT and AST, no temporal trend is noted. A slight increase over time, in mean bilirubin 
is noted. Judging by the total level of bilirubin, this is presently of no clinical concern.  
The Acala-mono arm had a lower frequency of hepatotoxicity events than subjects in the other 2 
treatment arms. Subjects in the Acala+Obin treatment arm had the highest frequency of 
hepatotoxicity events across the 3 treatment arms. Grade ≥3 hepatotoxicity events occurred in 5.1% 
in the Acala+Obin arm, compared to 0.6% in the Acala mono arm.  
A total of 6 subjects (2 subjects in each treatment arm) fulfilled the biochemical criteria for Hy’s law 
(elevations ≥3×ULN in ALT or AST concurrent with total bilirubin ≥2×ULN). In four subjects no action 
was taken with study medication, in 1 subject, acalabrutinib therapy was interrupted but restarted and 
in 1 patient acalabrutinib was discontinued. The applicant conducted a review of the laboratory and 
clinical data for each case described above and determined that these were not true Hy’s law cases. 
This conclusion is agreed.

ACE-CL-309 
Hepatotoxicity was much less common in the Acala arm compared to the IR/BR arm. Hepatic toxicity is 
however, a known ADR with the frequency very common, with respect to idelalisib, and for 
bendamustin with the frequency common.  
No SAEs of hepatotoxicity events or Grade 4 or Grade 5 hepatotoxicity events occurred in the 
acalabrutinib arm in ACE-CL 309, while three subjects treated with IR had serious hepatotoxicity 
events and four additional subjects had non-serious Grade 4 hepatotoxicity.  
Pooled populations: In the Mono HemMalig population, hepatotoxicity events were reported in 3.7% of 
subjects. Grade ≥3 TEAEs of hepatotoxicity occurred in 1.7% of subjects. In the Mono HemMalig 
population, the most common hepatic AE (all grades) was ALT increased (2.0%). The frequency of all 
grades and Grade ≥3 hepatic AEs higher in the Combo CLL (7.2%, 4.0%) population. 
Infections 
ACE-CL-007 
Infections occurred more frequently in the two acalabrutinib containing arms, 69.1% in the Acala+Obin 
arm and 65.4% in the Acala-mono arm. The most frequent infection events, in both arms, were upper 
respiratory infections, and second in order, urinary tract infections. Grade ≥3 events occurred in 
20.8% and 14.0%, respectively.  
One case of PML (Grade 3 SAE) was reported in a patient in the Acala+Obin arm, who earlier had 
discontinued obinutuzumab after just one dose, due to neutropenia. The event was reported as related 
to acalabrutinib. The event led to discontinuation of study drug.  
Hepatitis B reactivation (Grade 2) was reported in 2 cases in the Acala+Obin arm and considered 
related to obinutuzumab and acalabrutinib. This led to discontinuation of study drug in both subjects. 
Subjects in the Clb+Obin arm had infection events at lower rates than subjects in the other 2 
treatment arms. The most frequent infection events were upper respiratory infections in 8.3% and 
urinary tract infections in 4.7%. Grade ≥3 events occurred in 8.3%. 
ACE-CL-309 
Infections occurred in 56.5%, 65.3%, and 48.6% of subjects treated with Acala, IR, or BR, 
respectively, and Grade ≥3 infections occurred in 14.9%, 28.0%, and 11.4% of subjects in the 3 
treatment groups, respectively. The most common infections in all treatment groups were upper 
respiratory tract infection, reported in 22 (14.3%), 17 (14.4%), and 4 (11.4%) subjects in the 3 
treatment groups, respectively.  
Twenty subjects who received acalabrutinib had SAEs of infection, of which the most common of which 
was pneumonia (8 subjects).  
Hepatitis B reactivation was reported for 2 patients in the acalabrutinib arm. One was of Grade 3 
Hepatitis B reactivation and 1 of Grade 1. None were reported as SAEs. 
Pooled populations: In the Mono HemMalig population infections occurred in 66.7% with the most 
common event upper respiratory tract infection (22%). In the Combo CLL infections occurred in 74% 
with the most common event upper respiratory tract infection (31.4%). 
Herpes zoster reactivation was reported in all pooled populations but with a higher frequency in the 
Combo CLL pool (4.9%). In Mono HemMalig and ComboCLL populations, there were also Grade ≥3 
HZV/HSV infections reported. Since both HBV and HSV/ Herpes zoster reactivations have been

reported in acalabrutinib combination treatment and acalabrutinib mono treatment this should be 
clarified in the SmPC. 
Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis 
Interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis in Acala-mono and Acala+Obin treatment, was reported ~1%, 
The IR group had a significantly higher ILD frequency, 6.8%, Grade ≥3 events in 3.4%. The data does 
not support inclusion of ILD in the SmPC, however, the applicant presented arguments against 
including ILD as an important potential risk in the RMP. The arguments are accepted. Routine 
pharmacovigilance activities are expected to suffice. 
Second Primary Malignancies (Including and Excluding Skin) 
ACE-CL-007 
Second primary malignancies (any grade) occurred in 19 (10.7%), 15 (8.4%) and 6 (3.6%) subjects in 
the Acala+Obin arm, Acala-mono arm, and Clb+Obin arm, respectively. Basal cell carcinoma was the 
most frequent second primary malignancy (any grade) in the Acala+Obin and Acala-mono treatment 
arms (7 subjects [3.9%] and 8 subjects [4.5%], respectively). All Grade ≥3 events of second primary 
malignancies (by PT) occurred in ≤2 subjects with the exception of basal cell carcinoma. The median 
time to first onset of SPMs was in the Acala+Obin arm 226 d, in the Acala-mono arm 136 d and in the 
Clb+Obin arm 41 d.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/458179/2020  
Page 129/147 
 
 
 
 
Further, 13 events of SPMs were identified outside the treatment-emergent period or were preferred 
terms of second primary malignancy not captured by the ECI definition criteria. Eleven of these 
occurred in the Clb+Obin arm, (not counting patients the cross-over cohort) and 2 in the Acala-mono 
arm. Out of these eleven cases in the Clb+Obin arm, only two were SPMs not counting non-melanomas 
skin cancer.     
ACE-CL-309 
Treatment-emergent second primary malignancies occurred in 11.7%, 2.5% and 1 (2.9%) subjects in 
the acalabrutinib, IR, and BR treatment groups, respectively. Grade ≥3 events occurred in 6 (3.9%) 
subjects treated with acalabrutinib and 1 (2.9%) subject treated with BR. Seven Acala-treated subjects 
had SAEs of second primary malignancies, including 2 subjects with Grade 5 events (lung neoplasm 
malignant [1] and neuroendocrine carcinoma [1]). One subject had a non-serious event of Grade 3 
bladder transitional cell carcinoma, that was reported as related to acalabrutinib treatment. 
In the pooled populations the frequency of SPMs (nonmelanoma skin only) increased every year from 
initiation of study treatment. Likewise, the frequency of second primary malignancy (excluding 
nonmelanoma skin) increased every year from initiation of study treatment. 
Tumour Lysis Syndrome 
In the Acala mono arms, TLS occurred in either 0% or ≤1%. In the Acala+Obin groups, TLS occurred 
with a slightly higher frequency. Of the both pivotal studies all treatment arms, subjects receiving the 
combination of Clb+Obin were at the highest risk of experiencing TLS. 
Laboratory findings 
Among subjects treated with acalabrutinib, there were no clinically meaningful trends in haematology 
or clinical laboratory values, serum immunoglobulin values, or vital sign values. In the acalabrutinib-
containing treatment arms, the trend toward worsening of baseline toxicity grade was limited to 
decreased neutrophils and platelets, and increased leukocytes. In the obinutuzumab-containing 
treatment arms, a trend toward worsening of baseline toxicity grade for the haematology parameters 
of decreased neutrophils, haemoglobin and platelets. With respect to baseline level of CD4+, CD8+ 
lymphocytes (T-lymphocytes) and NK cells, a slight decrease was seen in the Acala+Obin and Acala-
mono arm. A more obvious decrease was, however, seen in the Clb+Obin arm. CD19+ (B-cells) cells 
decreased in all three treatment arms but was most pronounced in the Clb+Obin arm. 
The most common Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormality was increased urate, reported in 29.2%, 
22.3% and 37.3% of subjects in the Acala+Obin, Acala-mono, and Clb+Obin treatment arms, 
respectively. This was sees without any change in S-Creatinine. In Study ACE-CL-007, the median time 
to maximum increase in urate varies between the three treatment groups but seems to be more 
related to study treatment initiation in the two obinutuzumab containing arms, rather than related to 
acalabrutinib. Surprisingly, no clear conclusion can be drawn, with respect to relationship between TLS 
and urate increased, from study ACE-CL-007.  
Abnormalities in ALT, alkaline phosphatase and AST occurred notably less frequently the acalabrutinib 
arm compared to the IR and BR groups. In addition, albumin was decreased in a higher rate, in the 
latter two groups. Laboratory shifts ≥3 were significantly more frequent in the IR/BR arm. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/458179/2020

Compared to the Mono HemMalig pool, the ComboCLL pool had higher rates of shifts in laboratory 
parameters. However, the clinical importance concerning shifts in laboratory levels, without knowledge 
of concurrent clinical events cannot be concluded. 
In the pivotal study ACE-CL-007, treatment induced lymphocytosis only occurred in the two 
acalabrutinib containing arms, slightly more in the monotherapy arm, compared to the combination 
arm. The onset and duration of lymphocytosis in Acala-mono arms are in concordance between the two 
pivotal studies and repeated in the pooled populations. However, duration of lymphocytosis was 
shorter when acalabrutinib and obinutuzumab was combined. Lymphocytosis was less marked and with 
shorter duration, in the IR treated group in pivotal study ACE-CL-309 and more or less absent in 
Clb+Obin and BR treatment. The were no reports of leukostasis.  
Vital signs, ECG, blood pressure and related observations 
Based on the findings of a Phase 1 thorough QT/QTc study, conducted in 48 healthy adult subjects 
(Study ACE-HV-005), therapeutic or supratherapeutic plasma acalabrutinib concentrations in healthy 
subjects and previously treated CLL subjects, did not prolong the QTc interval in a thorough QT study, 
nor cause any shift in relevant electrocardiographic measurements. 
ECGs were performed at Screening only, in two pivotal studies. During screening for the study ACE-CL-
007, 4 patients in the Acala+Obin arm, 3 subjects in the Acala-mono arm and 2 subjects in the 
Clb+Obin arm met the criteria of QTcF or QTcB >480 msec. All these 9 subjects were enrolled under 
Protocol Amendment 2.0 which did not have an exclusion for QTcF or QTcB >480 msec, hence these 
were not considered to be important protocol deviations. However, no ventricular tachyarrhythmias 
were reported in any of the study arms during the treatment period. 
In the study ACE-CL-309, no patients met the criteria of QTcF >480 ms. One patient had a significant 
abnormal ECG at baseline. No ventricular tachyarrhythmias were reported in study ACE-CL-309.  
Safety in special populations 
Renal impairment 
Patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine >2.5×ULN, estimated CrCl <30 (using Cockcroft-
Gault formula i.e. Grade ≥3 renal impairment), were not included in the clinical development program. 
In the Mono HemMalig population, 33.3% of the subjects had normal renal function, 40.9% of the 
subjects had mild renal dysfunction and 24.1% of the subjects had moderate renal dysfunction. 
Anemia, neutropenia, decreased appetite, and pneumonia were Grade ≥3 AEs reported in ≥2 
percentage points more subjects with moderate renal dysfunction than subjects with normal renal 
function. 
Hepatic impairment 
The two pivotal studies included only patients with a baseline hepatic impairment Grade ≤1. This was 
also the case with the supportive studies included in the pooled populations. 12 subjects with mild to 
moderate hepatic impairment, received acalabrutinib in PK/pharmacodynamics studies.  
In Mono HemMalig population 858 (82.0%) subjects with normal hepatic function, 160 (15.3%) 
subjects with mild hepatic function, and 9 (0.9%) subjects with moderate hepatic function were 
enrolled. The incidence in subjects with normal hepatic function, mild hepatic function and moderate 
hepatic function (n=1), experiencing any AE, and the proportions of subjects with specific AEs, were 
generally similar between the hepatic function subgroups. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/458179/2020  
Page 131/147 
 
 
 
Sex 
Male subjects were 67.9% in the Mono HemMalig population. Most of male and female subjects 
experienced any AE, and the proportions of subjects with specific AEs were generally similar between 
the sexes. The most common AEs (all grades), that were reported in ≥ 5 % more in female than male 
subjects were anaemia (16.7% vs 11.6%), neutropenia (16.4% vs 10.4%), petechiae (14.3% vs 
8.9%), and urinary tract infection (14.9% vs 5.4%). In addition, Grade ≥3 AEs reported in ≥2 % more 
in female than male subjects were anaemia and neutropenia. 
Age 
In the Mono HemMalig population, 37.5% of the subjects were ≤65 years old, 41.1% of the subjects 
≥65 years but ≤75 years and 22.0% were≥75 years.   
The proportion of patients experiencing any AE were generally similar between the age groups, as 
were the proportions of subjects with specific AEs. Headache and sinusitis were reported in more 
subjects (≥10 %) in the younger category. Grade ≥3 anaemia was reported in more subjects in the 
oldest category, compared to subjects in the younger categories.   
Immunological events 
No relevant findings were seen, immunological events were not specifically studied.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the Acala mono arms in the two pivotal studies, dose interruptions occurred due to AEs in 15.6%, 
18.8%, in ACE-CL-007 and ACE-CL-309, respectively. The events of infusion related interruptions

occurred to a notably lesser extent in the Acala+Obin combination compared to Clb+Obin combination 
(21.3% versus 49,1%). Similar data was shown in the pooled populations. 
The rate of study drug discontinuations in the acalabrutinib arms in the pivotal studies as well as the 
pooled populations was at the range of 9-10%. In addition, the discontinuation rate due to AEs in the 
crossover group in study ACE-CL-007 was 6.7% and the crossover group in study ACE-CL-309 was 
8.6%. Chlorambucil was discontinued in 14% of the patients while any discontinuation in the IR/BR 
arm (combined), was 44.4%. Discontinuation of obinutuzumab in the 2 obinutuzumab-containing arms 
was 6% and the most common reasons were infusion related reactions and neutropenia.    
Post marketing experience 
No further safety findings were identified from marketing experience.  
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The application is based on interim analyses of 2 pivotal studies, relevant to the claimed indication, i.e. 
CLL and additional 8 supportive studies, together making up the different pooled populations. The 
largest pool, Mono HemMalig consists of 1040 subjects, from all hematologic malignancy studies in 
which subjects received at least 1 dose of acalabrutinib monotherapy including subjects who crossed 
over from any control arm in the pivotal trials. The majority in the pool was CLL patients. The size of 
the safety data base is deemed adequate to assess the tolerability of acalabrutinib. 
The mean duration of acalabrutinib exposure, combined for the two monotherapy arms was, as of the 
primary analysis, in the pivotal studies 19.3 months and in the Mono HemMalig pool, 24.6 months. In 
the Mono HemMalig pool, 72% were exposed >12 months and 51% more than 24 months. The time of 
exposure is considered adequate to assess TEAEs during short and medium time of exposure. The final 
reports and outstanding data on long-term safety, should be part of post-authorisation measures.  
In the pivotal study ACE-CL-007 (previously untreated), the substantially longer duration of treatment 
in the two acalabrutinib containing arms vs the Clb-Obin arm, should be noted when comparing AE 
rates. The same applies to the second pivotal study, ACE-CL-309 (relapsed/refractory) in which the BR 
group in arm B had a 6 months treatment period while the IR population received treatment until PD or 
unacceptable toxicity. 
ACE-CL-007 (first line): In the Acala+Obin arm, fatal events occurred in the absence of disease 
progression in 6/178 (3.4%) of the patients and in the Acala-mono arm in 10/179 (5.6%) patients. In 
the Obin+Clb arm there were 12/169 (7.1%) deaths in the absence of disease progression. TEAEs 
leading to dose discontinuation of acalabrutinib were comparable in both acalabrutinib containing arms 
(Acala+Obin:10.7% and Acala-mono:9.5%) and the discontinuation rates for Obin were comparable in 
both obinutuzumab containing arms (Acala+Obin: 6.5% and Obin+Clb: 5.9%). TEAEs leading Clb 
discontinuation was 14.2%. TEAEs Grade ≥3 were reported in 70.2% in the Acala+Obin arm, with the 
most common AE neutropenia (29.8%) and infections (20.8%). In the Acala-mono arm, the TEAEs 
Grade ≥3 event rate was 49.7%, with the most common AEs infections (14%) and neutropenia 
(9.5%). For the Obin+Clb arm TEAEs Grade ≥3 was 69.8% with the most commonly reported AE 
Grade ≥3 neutropenia (41.1%) and thrombocytopenia (11.8%).  
SAEs Grade ≥3 were reported in 38.8%, 29.6% and 19.5% in the Acala+Obin arm, Acala-mono arm 
and Obin+Clb arm, respectively. Infusion related reactions (Obin) occurred in 13.5% in the Acala+Obin 
arm (Grade ≥3, 2.2%) and in 39.6% in the Obin+Clb arm (Grade ≥3, 5.3%). SPMs were reported in 
5.6% in the Acala+Obin arm, 2.8% in the Acala-mono arm and 1.8% in the Obin+Clb arm.    
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/458179/2020  
Page 133/147 
 
 
 
ACE-CL-309 (relapsed/refractory): In the Acala arm, fatal events occurred in the absence of disease 
progression in 9/154 (5.8%) patients and in the IR/BR arm in 10/4 (n=118/35; 8.4%/11.4%) 
patients. TEAEs leading to dose discontinuation occurred in 10.4% in the Acala arm and in 52.5% 
/17.1% in the IR/BR arm. TEAEs Grade ≥3 were reported in the Acala arm in 49.4%, the most 
common AEs neutropenia (15.6%) and anaemia (11.7%). In the IR group TEAE Grade ≥3 occurred in 
89.8%, with the most common AEs neutropenia (39.8%) and diarrhoea (27%). In the BR group TEAEs 
Grade ≥3 were reported in 48.6% with the most common AEs neutropenia 31.4% and anaemia in 
8.6%. SAEs Grade ≥3 were reported in the Acala arm in 26.6% and in IR/BR in 50.8% /25.7%.  
The major safety issues noted with acalabrutinib as events of clinical interest in the Mono HemMalig 
population include: Atrial fibrillation/flutter, any grade, was reported in 4.4% of subjects. Grade ≥3 
events were reported in 1.3% of subjects. Anaemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia were reported 
in 13.8%, 15.7%, and 8.9% of subjects, respectively. Overall frequency of haemorrhage events; 
46.3%. Major haemorrhage event was reported in 3.6%, with the most frequently reported sites; the 
GI tract, the CNS and epistaxis. SPMs were reported in 12.2% whereof the most frequent were skin 
malignancies (BCC 3.8% and SCCS 2.9%). SPMs, excluding nonmelanoma skin neoplasms, were 
reported in 6.5% of the subjects. 
Overall, the size of the database suggest confidence with respect to most safety issues, further data 
will be provided with the submission of the final study reports (see RMP).  
The nonclinical program has identified kidney, liver and heart as target organs of toxicity of 
acalabrutinib in rats and dogs. Macroscopic and microscopic findings in these organs were observed at 
doses above the maximum tolerated dose.  
With respect to kidney and liver, the clinical relevance of the non-clinical findings is unclear. From the 
data submitted, no safety signals/ concerns have been evoked relevant to these findings. Subjects with 
severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease have not been studied. Furthermore, it is not 
recommended to administer acalabrutinib in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.2 
and 4.4 of the SmPC). 
Cardiac events, beyond atrial fibrillation, occurred at a higher rate in acalabrutinib containing arms in 
both pivotal studies, compared to the comparator arms and must be further characterized. Use in 
patients with moderate to severe cardiac impairment is included in the safety specifications as missing 
information. Therefore, data from the final reports for the ongoing studies, will be informative for 
further characterisation of the safety profile of acalabrutinib. Hypertension is an Important Identified 
Risk, with an increasing prevalence over time exposed, for the approved BTK inhibitor, Ibrutinib. 
However, at this point, continuous exposure to acalabrutinib does not seem to increase the risk for 
hypertension.   
The inherent risk, for CLL patients, to develop SPMs makes the true acalabrutinib related increase of 
SPM still not fully characterised and SPMs are presently included as Important identified risk in the 
safety specification. It has been identified that the applicant does not plan to follow the patients with 
respect to SPMs, for the duration of the in the pivotal study ACE-CL-007, after a PFS event. SPMs will 
be further characterized within the scope of clinical Study D8220C00008 (see RMP) 
With respect to the updated safety analysis, with a data cut-off date of 01 August 2019, providing 
around 6 months of additional follow-up and an increase in median duration of treatment exposure of 6 
months, the safety profile seems to be consistent with the primary analysis. With regards to the 
proposed extrapolation to more fit patients than those studied in first line, this does not present a 
problem from the safety point of view, as greater rather than lesser tolerability of AE’s is assumed.  
Overall, acalabrutinib presents with an acceptable safety profile, while the addition of obinutuzumab 
was associated with, in some respects, a substantial increase in toxicity. However, the higher 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/458179/2020

frequency and grade of severities of the TEAEs reported, in the combination group, did not translate 
into a corresponding high proportion of permanent discontinuations or a decreased relative dose 
intensity. Furthermore, the chosen comparators, in the pivotal studies did in many aspects appear to 
have a less favourable safety profile, also compared to the acalabrutinib+obinutuzumab combination 
group. Long term safety data will be provided (see RMP). 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
In the safety database assessed acalabrutinib presents with a manageable safety profile.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing information regarding 
long term safety and second primary malignancies:  
•  Submission of clinical Study D8220C00008; Submission of final CSRs of the pivotal studies 007

Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is IBD is 31 October 2017. The new EURD list 
entry will therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of acalabrutinib with active substances contained in authorised 
medicinal products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, 
mixture of isomers, complex or derivative of any of them.  
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Calquence (acalabrutinib) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.  
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Calquence as monotherapy or in combination with obinutuzumab is indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL).  
Calquence as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic 
leukaemia (CLL) who have received at least one prior therapy.  
Assessment report

Page 138/147 
 
 
 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
In the frontline setting, the treatment approach is determined by several key factors which include 
prognostic molecular markers such as cytogenetic abnormalities and mutational status of the B-cell 
receptor (BCR) immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable (IGHV) genes, age, and co-morbidities. 
While fludarabine-based chemoimmunotherapy is standard for treatment-naive younger/fitter patients 
with  CLL,  the  therapy  for  older  patients  or  patients  with  co-morbidities  is  less  well  defined.  The 
combination  of  obinutuzumab+chlorambucil  is  indicated  in  patients  with  comorbidities  making  them 
unsuitable for full-dose fludarabine. According to the current ESMO guideline, it is recommended that 
patients with TP53 deletion/mutation are treated with ibrutinib in front-line. Because of severe infectious 
complications, the PI3K inhibitor idelalisib combined with rituximab is only recommended for frontline 
therapy in patients not suitable for Btk inhibitors.  
In the relapse and refractory disease, targeted therapies against B cell markers/antigens (venetoclax) 
or against components of the B cell receptor such as BTK (ibrutinib) or phosphoinositide-3 kinase 
(PI3K)δ (idelalisib) have demonstrated efficacy with less toxicity. Bendamustine in combination with 
rituximab is also an alternative in this population. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
ACE-CL-007 was a Randomized, Multicenter, Open-Label, 3 Arm Phase 3 Study of Obinutuzumab 
in Combination with Chlorambucil, ACP-196 in Combination with Obinutuzumab, and ACP- 196 
Monotherapy in Subjects with Previously Untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia. 
ACE-CL-309 was a Randomized, Multicenter, Open-Label, Phase 3 Study of Acalabrutinib (ACP-
196) Versus Investigator’s Choice of Either Idelalisib Plus Rituximab or Bendamustine Plus Rituximab in 
Subjects with Relapsed or Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia. Subjects were required to have 
received ≥1 prior systemic therapy for CLL to be eligible to enrol. Prior exposure to a B-cell lymphoma 
(BCL)-2 inhibitor (e.g., venetoclax/ABT-199) or a B-cell receptor (BCR) inhibitor (e.g., BTK inhibitors or 
PI3K inhibitors) was not allowed. 
Both studies excluded subjects with significant cardiovascular disease, history of stroke or intracranial 
haemorrhage within 6 months before randomization, or known history of a bleeding diathesis, and 
subjects who required anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists, treatment with proton-pump 
inhibitors or a strong CYP3A inhibitor/inducer. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In previously untreated CLL (study 007) with a median-follow up of 28 months and an event rate of 
52% in the control arm IRC-assessed PFS for Acala+Obin vs clb+obi, the primary outcome, showed a 
HR of 0.10 [95% CI: 0.06, 0.17]; p<0.0001, in favour of the Acala+Obin arm. The sensitivity analyses 
are supportive of this outcome. The median estimated PFS for the experimental arm was not reached; 
the median estimated PFS for the control arm was 22.6 months (95%CI: 20.2, 27.6). In terms of HR 
for PFS, the subgroup analyses consistently favour the experimental arm. IRC-assessed PFS for 
acalabrutinib monotherapy vs clb+obi, the key alpha-controlled secondary outcome, showed a HR of 
0.20 [95% CI: 0.13, 0.30]; p<0.0001 in favour of the experimental arm. The sensitivity analyses are 
supportive of this outcome. The median estimated PFS for acalabrutinib monotherapy was not reached; 
the median estimated PFS for the control arm was 22.6 months (95%CI: 20.2, 27.6). In terms of HR 
for PFS, the point estimates for the subgroup analyses consistently numerically favour the 
acalabrutinib monotherapy arm.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/458179/2020  
Page 139/147 
 
 
 
The activity of the acalabrutinib combination is slightly higher in the del17p/TP53 mutation-negative 
subgroup (95% vs 84% in the positive subgroup), while similar for the subgroups with acalabrutinib 
monotherapy where the activity corresponds to the activity of the acalabrutinib combination in the 
del17p/TP53 mutation-positive subgroup. The ORR of the control regimen is roughly similar to what is 
noted with acalabrutinib monotherapy in the negative subgroup but considerably lower than both 
experimental arms in positive disease, 56%. HR of 0.47 (0.21, 1.06) is reported for the acalabrutinib 
combination vs control, and a HR of 0.60 (0.28, 1.27) for acalabrutinib monotherapy vs control, both 
in favour of the experimental regimens. 
In relapsed or refractory CLL (study 309) with a median-follow up of 16 months (cutoff January 2019) 
and an event rate of only 44% in the control arm IRC-assessed PFS showed a HR of 0.31 [95% CI: 
0.20, 0.49]; p<0.0001, in favour of the experimental arm. The median estimated PFS for the 
experimental arm was not reached; the median estimated PFS for the control arm was 16.5 months 
(95%CI: 14.0, 17.1). The performed sensitivity analyses are supportive of the primary outcome. The 
subgroup analyses consistently favour the experimental arm. It is noted that the point estimate for PFS 
HR is 0.21 for the subgroup of subjects with del 17p or TP53 mutation (n=87) while 0.36 in the 
complementary group. With an event rate of 44% in the control arm, similar as for the primary 
analysis, the HR for investigator-assesses PFS, a secondary endpoint, was 0.28 (0.18, 0.45), p 
<0.0001, and thus consistent with the primary analysis. Updated results (cutoff 1 August 2019) based 
on investigator’s assessment: With a median follow-up of 22.1 months (range: 0.53-29.11) in the 
acalabrutinib arm and 21.9 months (range: 0.03-27.73) in the IR/BR arm, and event rates of 58% in 
the control arm and 23% in the experimental arm, the PFS HR was 0.27 [95% CI: 0.18, 0.40]; 
p<0.0001. The outcome is supported by the performed sensitivity analyses. The median estimated PFS 
for acalabrutinib was not reached; the median estimated PFS for IR/BR was 16.8 months (95% CI: 
14.1, 22.4). With 6 months longer follow-up, and an acceptable PFS maturity of 58% in the control 
arm, outcomes remain essentially stable.   
With a median follow-up of around 16 months event rates for OS were low, 12% in the control arm 
and 10% in the experimental arm. HR was 0.84 (0.42, 1.66). At the updated analysis, with a median 
follow-up of 22 months and 21 events in the acalabrutinib arm and 26 events in the control arm, HR 
was 0.78 (0.44, 1.40). 
Per IRC assessment, the median duration of response was 13.6 months in the control arm and not 
reached in the experimental arm; HR 0.33 (0.19, 0.59); at the updated analysis using investigator-
assessed DOR, the corresponding figures were 18 months, not reached, 0.19 (0.11, 0.33). The HR was 
0.35 (0.21, 0.58). At the updated analysis, the HR was 0.30 (0.20, 0.46). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
In study 007 with an event rate of only 10% in the control arm, and 5% in the Acala+Obin arm and 
6% in the monotherapy arm, data on OS is, as expected for a first-line treatment of CLL with a median 
of 28 months of follow-up, immature. In addition, the massive cross-over from the control arm to 
acalabrutinib monotherapy makes relative OS data practically non-interpretable. 
In study 309 based on event fractions of 34% in the control arm, including cross-over (23%), and 
14% in the experimental arm, the median time to next treatment was not reached for any of the study 
arms. The median time from first dose to subsequent anticancer therapy was 10 months in the 
experimental arm. Further follow up with special emphasis on time to subsequent therapy will be 
needed and this is expected to be included in the final clinical study report of the pivotal studies.

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety database comprises 1,040 subjects from 9 studies (Mono HemMalig) in patients receiving 
monotherapy acalabrutinib and 2 studies (ComboCLL, n=223) in patients receiving the combination of 
acalabrutinib and obinutuzumab, in total 10 studies. Median time of FU is 24.6 months for the Mono 
HemMalig pooled population. All studies were still ongoing at respective DCO, ranging from Oct 2017 
and Feb 2019. With respect to the two randomised pivotal studies (ACE-CL-007 DCO 08 Feb 2019 and 
ACE-CL-309 DCO 15 Jan 2019), both efficacy and safety data are derived from the first interim 
analyses.  
TEAEs leading to dose discontinuation of acalabrutinib in ACE-CL-007 were comparable in both 
acalabrutinib containing arms (Acala+Obin:10.7% and Acala-mono:9.5%) and the discontinuation 
rates for Obin were comparable in both obinutuzumab containing arms (Acala+Obin: 6.5% and 
Obin+Clb: 5.9%). TEAEs leading Clb discontinuation was 14.2%. TEAEs Grade ≥3 were reported in 
70.2% in the Acala+Obin arm, with the most common AE neutropenia (29.8%) and infections 
(20.8%). In the Acala-mono arm, the TEAEs Grade ≥3 event rate was 49.7%, with the most common 
AEs infections (14%) and neutropenia (9.5%). For the Obin+Clb arm TEAEs Grade ≥3 was 69.8% with 
the most commonly reported AE Grade ≥3 neutropenia (41.1%) and thrombocytopenia (11.8%).  
SAEs Grade ≥3 were reported in 38.8%, 29.6% and 19.5% in the Acala+Obin arm, Acala-mono arm 
and Obin+Clb arm, respectively. Infusion related reactions (Obin) occurred in 13.5% in the Acala+Obin 
arm (Grade ≥3, 2.2%) and in 39.6% in the Obin+Clb arm (Grade ≥3, 5.3%). 
SPMs were reported in 5.6% in the Acala+Obin arm, 2.8% in the Acala-mono arm and 1.8% in the 
Obin+Clb arm.    
In the Acala arm in ACE-CL-309, fatal events occurred in the absence of disease progression in 9/154 
(5.8%) patients and in the IR/BR arm in 10/4 (n=118/35; 8.4%/11.4%) patients. TEAEs leading to 
dose discontinuation occurred in 10.4% in the Acala arm and in 52.5% /17.1% in the IR/BR arm. 
TEAEs Grade ≥3 were reported in the Acala arm in 49.4%, the most common AEs neutropenia (15.6%) 
and anemia (11.7%). In the IR group TEAE Grade ≥3 occurred in 89.8%, with the most common AEs 
neutropenia (39.8%) and diarrhea (27%). In the BR group TEAEs Grade ≥3 were reported in 48.6% 
with the most common AEs neutropenia 31.4% and anemia in 8.6%.  SAEs Grade ≥3 were reported in 
the Acala arm in 26.6% and in IR/BR in 50.8% /25.7%. The major safety issues noted with 
acalabrutinib treatment based on ECI: Mono HemMalig population. Atrial fibrillation/flutter, any grade, 
was reported in 4.4% of subjects. Grade ≥3 events were reported in 1.3% of subjects. Anemia, 
neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia were reported in 13.8%, 15.7%, and 8.9% of subjects, 
respectively. Overall frequency of haemorrhage events; 46.3%. Major haemorrhage event was 
reported in 3.6%, with the most frequently reported sites; the GI tract, the CNS and epistaxis. SPMs 
were reported in 12.2% whereof the most frequent were skin malignancies (BCC 3.8% and SCCS 
2.9%). SPMs, excluding nonmelanoma skin neoplasms, were reported in 6.5% of the subjects. 
The frequencies in the Mono HemMalig population were consistent with what was observed in the Acala 
mono arms of the 2 pivotal studies. The most commonly reported TEAEs any grade in the Mono 
HemMalig population, were headache (37.8%), diarrhea (36%7), upper respiratory tract infection 
(22.0%), nausea (21.7%), fatigue and asthenia (26.6%), most of which were of severity Grade 1 or 2. 
Frequently occurring event were also; cough, rash, musculoskeletal pain. SOC Bleeding events 
occurred in (46.3%; e.g. haematuria, epistaxis, bruising, etc), Fatal TEAE occurred in 4.5%. 
With respect to differences between the Mono HemMalig population and the ComboCLL population, the 
following aspect are worth noticing: neutropenia: ComboCLL 31.8% (Gr≥3: 30.0%); Mono HemMalig 
15.7% (Gr≥3:14.2%); thrombocytopenia: ComboCLL 13.9% (Gr≥3: 6.7%); Mono HemMalig 8.9% 
(Gr≥3: 3.6%); infections: ComboCLL 74.0% (Gr≥3: 21.5%); Mono HemMalig 66.7% (Gr≥3:~8%); 
Assessment report

hepatotoxicity: ComboCLL 7.2%; Mono HemMalig 3.7%; hypertension: ComboCLL 13.5%; Mono 
HemMalig 7.6%; infusion related reactions: ComboCLL 19.3%; Mono HemMalig 0.8%; Any Grade ≥3 
AE: ComboCLL (70.4%); Mono HemMalig (54.1%). The rate of Atrial fibrillation, Haemorrhage and 
Major haemorrhage and anemia occurred at a similar rate in both populations. 
3.5.   Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The size of the database suggests confidence with respect to most safety issues, but final study reports 
from the pivotal studies and safety updates from Study D8220C00008, a Phase 3b, multicentre, open-
label, single-arm study of CALQUENCE (ACP-196) in subjects with CLL are awaited (see RMP).  
Cardiac events, beyond atrial fibrillation, occurred at a higher rate in acalabrutinib-containing arms in 
both pivotal studies, compared to the comparator arms and must be further characterised. Use in 
patients with moderate to severe cardiac impairment is included in the safety specifications as missing 
information. Therefore, data from the final reports for the ongoing studies will be informative to further 
characterise the safety profile of acalabrutinib. Report from a cohort to Study D8220C00008 with the 
primary objective the safety of Calquence in patients with moderate to severe cardiac impairment will 
be provided in Q3 2020 (see RMP).  
The inherent risk, for CLL patients, to develop SPMs makes the true acalabrutinib-related increase of 
SPM still not fully characterised and SPMs are presently included as Important identified risk in the 
safety specification. SPMs will also be further characterised in the upcoming PAM (Study 
D8220C00008), see RMP.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The PFS benefit noted with both experimental regimens, Acala+Obin and acalabrutinib monotherapy, is 
deemed robust and of clear clinical relevance. The safety profile is in line with the known safety of a 
BTK inhibitor. With respect to safety, the AE burden is higher in the combination arm, but both arms 
display a reasonable side effect profile given the intended use and both regimens can be approvable; 
the selection of that considered most suitable for the individual patient should be based on the data 
generated in study 007. 
The pivotal study 007 only enrolled subjects ≥65 years of age or younger with comorbidities. However, 
extrapolation of efficacy also to younger and more fit patients is considered acceptable. Regarding 
subjects with del 17p/TP53-mutated disease data from the 007 study show similar point estimates for 
HR PFS in the group with these genomic aberrations as in the group without for both the Acala+Obin 
and the acalabrutinib monotherapy arm, and ORR for both the combination and the acalabrutinib 
monotherapy was as high as 83-84% in del 17p/TP53-mutated disease, similar as for acalabrutinib 
monotherapy in del 17p/TP53-negative disease, while only 56% in the control arm. Thus, data on ORR 
support retained activity in del 17p/TP53-mutated disease for both Acala+Obin and acalabrutinib 
monotherapy, but as data relative to a suboptimal control are of limited use, absolute data on PFS and 
ORR with DOR per treatment arm and genetic risk status (del 17p or TP53-mutation vs the 
complementary group) suggest that also the acalabrutinib-containing study arms performed

numerically inferior in subjects with del 17p or TP53 mutation-positive disease. The acalabrutinib 
monotherapy indication in previously untreated disease also lends support from the data obtained in 
the relapsed/refractory setting. 
In relapsed or refractory CLL the PFS benefit noted with the experimental regimen, acalabrutinib 
monotherapy, is deemed robust with retained activity in del 17p/TP53-mutated disease, and of clear 
clinical relevance. No major unfavourable effects unexpected for a BTK inhibitor have been observed. 
At an updated analysis per investigator assessment with 6 months longer follow-up, and PFS maturity 
of 58% in the control arm, outcomes remain essentially stable.  
The proposed indication for Calquence in the relapsed/refractory setting includes patients previously 
treated with ibrutinib or venetoclax; external data reasonably support the use of BTK inhibitors in 
subjects previously treated with venetoclax, and the use of acalabrutinib in subjects intolerant, but not 
resistant, to ibrutinib. This is deemed in line with what could mechanistically be expected.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The benefits of Calquence either in monotherapy or in combination with obinutuzumab outweigh the 
risks. As per the above discussion, extrapolation to the full treatment-naïve population is deemed 
reasonable. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Calquence:  
as monotherapy or in combination with obinutuzumab is indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL);  
as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic 
leukaemia (CLL) who have received at least one prior therapy; 
is positive.  
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Calquence is not similar to Gazyvaro and Imbruvica 
within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.  
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/458179/2020  
Page 145/147 
 
 
 
 
 
that the benefit-risk balance of Calquence is favourable in the following indication: 
“Calquence as monotherapy or in combination with obinutuzumab is indicated for the treatment of 
adult patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). 
Calquence as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic 
leukaemia (CLL) who have received at least one prior therapy.” 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription. 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Conditions or restrictions with regards to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
Conditions or restrictions with regards to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product to be implemented by the Member States 
Not applicable. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that acalabrutinib is a new active

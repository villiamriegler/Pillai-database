Introduction 
On March 21 2016, the MAH submitted the final clinical study report for study NO1364, in accordance 
with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical clinical overview has also been provided. 
1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that study NO1364 is a stand alone study. 
1.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
The study medications were levetiracetam (LEV) 1000 mg/day and carbamazepine immediate-
release (CBZ-IR) 400mg/day. 
1.3.  Clinical aspects 
1.3.1.  Description of the study 
Title:  
“A Multicenter, Open-Label, Randomized, Parallel-Group, Active-Controlled Study Comparing the 
Efficacy and Safety of Levetiracetam to Carbamazepine Used as Monotherapy in Subjects (≥16 Years) 
Newly or Recently Diagnosed as Suffering from Epilepsy and Experiencing Partial Seizures.” 
Methods 
Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate the non-inferiority of the efficacy of 
LEV (1000mg/day) versus CBZ-IR (400mg/day) used as monotherapy for at least 6 months. 
Efficacy was measured as a primary variable by 6-month seizure freedom in adult subjects 
(≥16 years of age) who were newly or recently diagnosed with epilepsy and were experiencing 
POS with or without secondarily generalized seizures. 
The secondary objective was to compare the safety and tolerability of both drugs in the same 
population. 
Study design 
This was a Phase 3, multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel-group, active-controlled study 
comparing the efficacy and safety of LEV to CBZ-IR as monotherapy in adult subjects 
(≥16 years of age) newly or recently diagnosed with epilepsy and experiencing POS. Subjects 
were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to treatment with LEV 1000mg/day or CBZ-IR 400mg/day. 
The study consisted of the following periods: 
EMA/489130/2016  
Page 2/15 
 
 
 
 
 
 Screening Period (up to 1 week): The Screening Period allowed the Investigator to evaluate 
subjects for suitability for study enrollment. It was acceptable for this visit to be conducted 
on more than 1 day, although it should not have extended over a period longer than 1 week. 
 Up-Titration Period (2 weeks): The Up-Titration Period started with Visit 2. At this time, 
subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to their drug treatment (LEV 1000mg/day or 
CBZ-IR 400mg/day). The randomization was stratified by the number of seizures in the 
3-month period prior to Visit 1 (≤2 seizures and >2 seizures). Subjects started receiving study 
drug at half the randomized target dose (LEV 250mg bid or CBZ-IR 200mg once daily [qd]). 
At the end of the Up-Titration Period, subjects started receiving the full target dose 
(LEV 500mg bid or CBZ-IR 200mg bid). Subjects who did not reach or tolerate the target 
dose were withdrawn. 
 Stabilization Period (1 week): 1 Stabilization Visit was conducted at the end of the 
Stabilization Period, 1 week after the end of the Up-Titration Period. 
 Evaluation Period (26 weeks): Following completion of the Stabilization Period, subjects 
began the Evaluation Period. Two Interim Evaluation Visits (IEVs) were conducted 8 weeks 
apart. A Full Evaluation Visit (FEV) was conducted 10 weeks after the second IEV. 
A subject continued to be treated in the Evaluation Period for up to 26 weeks unless a seizure 
occurred or the subject needed to be withdrawn from the study. In these cases, the subject 
had an Early Discontinuation Visit (EDV). If a seizure occurred during the Evaluation Period 
and the subject was entering the Named Patient Program (NPP), a dose titration was planned. 
If the subject was withdrawn, the dose was down-titrated at the discretion of the Investigator. 
 Named Patient Program: Subjects in the LEV treatment group who were seizure free during 
the 26-Week Evaluation Period or who had a seizure and needed further dose titration had 
the opportunity to continue taking LEV in the NPP until the monotherapy indication was 
approved in China or until UCB terminated the development of this indication in China. 
Patients may have had their dose up-titrated to 3000mg/day (refer to the NPP Guidance Book 
for details). Visits were planned according to the routine clinical practice. 
Subjects in the CBZ-IR treatment group who were seizure free at the end of the Evaluation 
Period, or who had a seizure and needed further dose titration, had the opportunity to 
participate in the NPP for a maximum of 6 months. Subjects may have had their dose 
up-titrated to 1600mg/day (refer to the NPP Guidance Book for details). After 6 months, 
subjects switched to prescribed marketed CBZ-IR at the discretion of the Investigator. 
Subjects who did not enter the NPP entered the Down-Titration Period and stopped 
EMA/489130/2016

randomized study drug treatment. 
 Down-Titration Period (including Safety Follow-Up [SFU] Visit): Following the EDV, 
subjects who did not enter the NPP entered a Down-Titration Period over a maximum of 
3 weeks. An SFU Visit was scheduled 2 weeks after the last study drug intake.

Study duration per subject 
The maximum duration of study participation per subject was expected to be up to 33 weeks 
including the Screening Period (up to 1 week), Up-Titration Period (2 weeks), Stabilization 
Period (1 week), Evaluation Period (26 weeks), and Down-Titration Period (up to 3 weeks). 
The end of the study was defined as the date of the last visit of the last subject in the Evaluation 
Period or Down-Titration Period. 
Planned number of subjects and sites 
Approximately 550 subjects were planned to be enrolled in the study at approximately 28 sites in 
order to randomize 436 subjects. 
Anticipated regions and countries 
The study was conducted in mainland China.

Investigator. 
Treatment 
The study medications were Oral tablets of LEV (250mg and 500mg) and oral tablets of CBZ-IR (200 
mg). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy  
The primary efficacy variable was the proportion of subjects remaining seizure free during the 6-month 
(26 weeks) Evaluation Period. 
Results 
Subject disposition 
A total of 436 subjects in the Randomized Set started the study; 220 subjects in the LEV group 
and 216 subjects in the CBZ-IR group. A total of 218 subjects (50.0%) discontinued from the 
study; 127 subjects (57.7%) in the LEV group and 91 subjects (42.1%) in the CBZ-IR group. 
The most frequently reported reasons for discontinuation in all subjects were lack of efficacy 
(LOE) (135 subjects [31.0%]), adverse events (AEs) (33 subjects [7.6%]), and consent 
withdrawn (not due to AE) (30 subjects [6.9%]). More subjects in the LEV group discontinued 
from the study due to LOE compared with the CBZ-IR group (94 subjects [42.7%] vs 41 subjects 
[19.0%], respectively), and fewer subjects discontinued from the study due to AEs in the LEV 
group compared with the CBZ-IR group (7 subjects [3.2%] vs 26 subjects [12.0%], respectively). 
A total of 337 subjects (77.3%) entered the NPP; 179 subjects (81.4%) in the LEV group and 
158 subjects (73.1%) in the CBZ-IR group. 
Paediatric subjects

A total of 28 subjects were <18 years old at study entry (19 subjects were 17 years old; 9 were 
16 years old). Twelve of these subjects were female; 16 were male. Fourteen subjects were 
randomized to LEV 1000mg/day, and 14 subjects were randomized to CBZ-IR 400mg/day 
(Table 4‒1).

Fifteen subjects discontinued the study: 8 in the LEV group and 7 in the CBZ-IR group. The 
most common reason for discontinuation in the LEV group was LOE (8 subjects, compared with 
3 subjects in the CBZ-IR group). The most common reasons for discontinuation in the CBZ-IR 
group were adverse event and LOE (3 subjects each in the CZB-IR group, compared with no 
subjects in the LEV group). Thirteen subjects completed the study, 6 subjects in the LEV group 
and 7 subjects in the CBZ-IR group 
Efficacy results 
The analysis of the primary efficacy variable, the proportion of subjects remaining seizure free 
during the 6-month Evaluation Period, indicated that fewer subjects in the LEV group reached 
6 months of seizure freedom compared with the CBZ-IR group (88 subjects [47.3%] vs 
117 subjects [68.4%]). The adjusted 6-month seizure freedom rate was 47.7% for LEV and 
70.6% for CBZ-IR with an adjusted difference of -22.9%; the 95% confidence interval (CI) was 
-33.1% to -12.6%. The lower bound of the 95% CI of this difference was not above the 
noninferiority margin of -20%, indicating that noninferiority of LEV compared with CBZ-IR 
could not be established at the administered doses. 
The results of the sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy variable, conducted on the Full 
Analysis Set (FAS), were similar to the primary analysis results observed for the Per Protocol Set 
(PPS). The adjusted 6-month seizure freedom rate was 46.9% for the LEV group and 68.8% for 
the CBZ-IR group with an adjusted difference of -21.9%; the 95% CI was -32.0% to -11.9%. A 
similar result was observed in both of the historical seizure count strata (≤2 seizures, >2 
seizures), with fewer subjects achieving 6 months of seizure freedom in the LEV group 
compared with the CBZ-IR group. 
A smaller proportion of subjects were retained in the study for the 30-week period in the LEV 
group (90 subjects [48.4%]) compared with the CBZ-IR group (120 subjects [70.2%]).

Safety results 
Overall, the mean duration of exposure to LEV for subjects in the LEV group was 128.7 days (range: 1 
to 226 days). The mean duration of exposure to CBZ-IR for subjects in the CBZ-IR group was 148.0 
days (range: 1 to 241 days). 
A total of 135 subjects (61.9%) in the LEV group reported 464 treatment-emergent adverse 
events (TEAEs) and 146 subjects (67.9%) in the CBZ-IR group reported 469 TEAEs. The 
incidence of serious TEAEs and severe TEAEs was similar between the LEV and CBZ-IR 
groups (4.1% vs 5.1% and 4.6% vs 5.6%, respectively). Discontinuations due to TEAEs, 
permanent withdrawal of study drug due to TEAEs, TEAEs requiring dose change, and adverse 
drug reactions (ADRs) were reported with lower incidence in the LEV group (12 subjects 
[5.5%], 12 subjects [5.5%], 22 subjects [10.1%], and 61 subjects [28.0%], respectively) 
compared with the CBZ-IR group (29 subjects [13.5%], 29 subjects [13.5%], 43 subjects 
[20.0%], and 80 subjects [37.2%], respectively). 
In general, the pattern observed when TEAEs were assessed by study period was similar to the 
pattern observed for TEAEs overall. 
The most frequently reported TEAEs by preferred term (PT) in the LEV group were 
nasopharyngitis (40 subjects [18.3%]), dizziness (33 subjects [15.1%]), and somnolence 
(20 subjects [9.2%]). The most frequently reported TEAEs in the CBZ-IR group were 
nasopharyngitis (32 subjects [14.9%]), dizziness (18 subjects [8.4%]), upper respiratory tract 
infection, and headache (both 16 subjects [7.4%]). By PT, the incidences of TEAEs were similar 
between treatment groups with the exceptions of GGT increased, white blood cell count 
decreased, and liver function test abnormal which were reported at lower incidences by subjects 
in the LEV group (0.9%, 0.5%, and 0, respectively) compared with the CBZ-IR group (5.1%, 
5.1%, and 4.2%, respectively). Dizziness and somnolence were reported at higher incidences by 
subjects in the LEV group (15.1% and 9.2%, respectively) compared with the CBZ-IR group 
(8.4% and 3.3%, respectively). 
The majority of TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity and were reported at a similar 
incidence in the LEV group (58.3% and 8.3%, respectively) and CBZ-IR group (61.4% and 
13.5%, respectively). During the study, 10 subjects (4.6%) in the LEV group reported a total of 
15 severe TEAEs and 12 subjects (5.6%) in the CBZ-IR group reported a total of 17 severe 
TEAEs. All of the severe TEAEs were reported by only 1 subject each per group, with the 
exceptions of status epilepticus, reported by 2 subjects in the LEV group, and abortion induced 
reported by 2 subjects in the CBZ-IR group.

Sixty-one subjects (28.0%) in the LEV group and 80 subjects (37.2%) in the CBZ-IR group 
reported ADRs during the study; 158 events were reported in each group. By PT, the ADRs most 
commonly reported were dizziness and somnolence (9.6% and 9.2%, respectively) in the LEV 
group, and dizziness (6.0%) in the CBZ-IR group. The incidence of ADRs was slightly lower in 
the LEV group compared with the CBZ-IR group with the exceptions of dizziness (9.6% vs 
6.0%, respectively) and somnolence (9.2% vs 2.8%, respectively), which were higher in the LEV 
group compared with the CBZ-IR group. 
The majority of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were mild or moderate in intensity; ADRs that 
were mild in intensity were reported at similar incidences in the LEV and CBZ-IR groups 
(27.1% and 30.7%, respectively). 
One death occurred during the study. One subject in the LEV group had a single TEAE of 
epilepsy on Day 132 during the Evaluation Period; the event was considered not related to study 
drug by the investigator. A full narrative for this subject is provided in N01364 CSR Section 12. 
Serious TEAEs were reported at similar incidences between the LEV group (9 subjects [4.1%]) 
and the CBZ-IR group (11 subjects [5.1%]). Serious TEAEs by PT were reported by no more 
than 1 subject in either treatment group, with the exceptions of status epilepticus (2 subjects 
[0.9%] in the LEV group and 1 subject [0.5%] in the CBZ-IR group) and abortion induced 
(1 subject [0.5%] in the LEV group and 2 subjects [0.9%] in the CBZ-IR group). No subjects in 
the LEV group and 4 subjects (1.9%) in the CBZ-IR group reported serious ADRs. 
Overall, TEAEs leading to discontinuation were reported at a lower incidence by subjects in the 
LEV group (12 subjects [5.5%]) compared with the CBZ-IR group (29 subjects [13.5%]). 
Similarly, ADRs leading to discontinuation were reported at a lower incidence by subjects in the 
LEV group (5 subjects [2.3%]) compared with the CBZ-IR group (25 subjects [11.6%]). 
There were 4 pregnancies reported during the study; 3 subjects discontinued the study and 
3 subjects (1 subject in the LEV group and 2 subjects in the CBZ-IR group) reported induced 
abortions. 
There was no evidence of clinically relevant effects of LEV treatment on laboratory parameters, 
vital signs, ECG evaluations, or neurological examinations. Laboratory abnormalities related to 
CBZ-IR included PCS GGT values in 2 subjects and TEAEs of drug induced liver injury related 
to elevated AST and ALT in 1 subject. Few relevant effects of CBZ-IR treatment on vital signs, 
ECG evaluations, or neurological examinations were observed. 
Paediatric subjects 
EMA/489130/2016

Of the 28 subjects aged <18 years, 21 subjects reported 101 TEAEs; 11 subjects in the LEV 
group reported 47 TEAEs, and 10 subjects in the CBZ-IR group reported 54 TEAEs. Most 
TEAEs were mild or moderate. One subject in the LEV group had an SAE (seizure); 1 subject in 
the CBZ-IR group had 2 SAEs (lung infection and rash). The event of rash was considered drug 
related; the other SAEs were considered not related to study drug by the Investigator. All SAEs 
were severe and resolved. One subject in the LEV group and 4 subjects in the CBZ-IR group 
discontinued due to an AE (N01364 CSR Listing 7.2). The AEs that led to discontinuation were 
seizure in the LEV group, and pruritus, 2 events of rash, and seizure in the CBZ-IR group. The 
events of pruritus and rash in the CBZ-IR group were considered drug related. No subjects aged 
<18 years died during the study. 
Conclusion of the MAH 
Results from N01364 show that non-inferiority of monotherapy LEV 1000mg/day compared with 
CBZ-IR 400mg/day could not be established with respect to effectiveness in Chinese subjects ≥16 
years of age recently diagnosed with epilepsy with POS. However, UCB believes that the 
result of the benefit risk consideration of the monotherapy indication of Keppra in adolescents 
(aged 16 and 17 years) is positive. 
Previous studies have demonstrated that over the complete dose range, LEV is as efficacious as 
CBZ; however, this could not be demonstrated in N01364 due to the study design, where only 
the lowest efficacious daily doses of LEV (1000mg) and CBZ-IR (400mg) were assessed. At 
1000mg/day, the 6-month seizure freedom rate of LEV in N01364 (47.3%) was lower than in the 
European PBO-controlled noninferiority study N01061 (59.1%), but very similar to the one 
(49.2%) seen in the open-label Japanese study N01375. The safety results from the current study 
support the results from previous LEV studies. Levetiracetam has a good safety profile and is 
better tolerated than CBZ-IR, with a lower incidence of TEAEs leading to discontinuation and 
ADRs in N01364. 
UCB has investigated possible explanations for why the primary objective was not met in 
N01364 and concluded that it is likely due to different aspects of the study design. The 
open-label design includes several sources of potential bias that might have impacted efficacy. 
Only the lowest efficacious daily doses of LEV and CBZ-IR were assessed in this study, and 
uptitration was not allowed if a subject experienced a seizure during the Evaluation Period. The 
criterion excluding subjects who tested positive for human leukocyte antigen major 
histocompatibility complex, class I, B (HLA-B)* 1502 allele may have biased the results toward 
CBZ. Subjects with this genotype and randomized to CBZ would have been more likely to 
EMA/489130/2016  
Page 14/15 
 
 
 
 
 
discontinue the study due to hypersensitivity reactions (ie, rash). In addition, the difference in 
seizure freedom at the dose of LEV 1000mg/day comparing studies N01364 and N01061 might 
be caused by a higher average disease severity of subjects in N01364, as indicated by slightly 
higher historical 1-year and 3-month seizure counts for the N01364 study population when 
compared with the N01061 population. 
No changes to the approved EU Product Information for Keppra are proposed following the 
completion of this study. 
2.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall conclusion 
Although the results from N01364 show that non-inferiority of monotherapy LEV 1000mg/day 
compared with CBZ-IR 400mg/day could not be established with respect to effectiveness in Chinese 
subjects ≥16 years of age recently diagnosed with epilepsy with POS, the evaluation of the safety data 
demonstrated that LEV was well tolerated and that the safety profile for LEV monotherapy was similar 
to the known data. No new safety concerns were identified in this study. 
Consequently, the rapporteur agrees with the MAH that no changes to the approved EU Product

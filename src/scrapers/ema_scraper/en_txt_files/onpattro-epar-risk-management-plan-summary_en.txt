Indication in adults for the treatment of: 
Epidemiology of the Indication and Target Population 
Hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR amyloidosis) in adult patients 
with stage 1 or stage 2 polyneuropathy 
Hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR amyloidosis) is a rapidly progressive, 
multisystem, debilitating, and ultimately fatal disease.[Adams 2021; Gertz 2017; Grodin 2019; 
Lane 2019; Parman 2016] hATTR amyloidosis results from genetic variants in the transthyretin 
(TTR) gene.  In hATTR amyloidosis, the tetrameric TTR protein becomes destabilized and 
disassociates into dimers and monomers, which subsequently misfold and deposit as amyloid in 
various organs and tissues, including the heart, peripheral nerves, and the gastrointestinal 
tract.[Hou 2007]  Progressive, chronically debilitating morbidity and mortality ensue.  
Historically, 2 clinical syndromes of hATTR amyloidosis have been described:  hATTR 
amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (also known as familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy [FAP]) 
and hATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy (also known as familial amyloidotic 
cardiomyopathy [FAC]), both of which are characterized by TTR amyloid deposits.[Ando 2013]  
As hATTR amyloidosis is a systemic disease with amyloid deposition in multiple organs, 
individual patients with hATTR amyloidosis often manifest signs and symptoms of both 
neuropathy and cardiomyopathy and thus the terminology has evolved, referring to 1 hereditary 
disease with a spectrum of clinical manifestations rather than attempting to classify the disease 
into 2 distinct syndromes.[Swiecicki 2015]  
The literature provides very limited incidence and prevalence data for hATTR amyloidosis.  This 
is due to the fact that this is a rare disease with varying endemicity by region.  For instance, 
hATTR amyloidosis is familial and therefore is identified with elevated prevalence in certain 
endemic foci within specific regions (each associated with a specific TTR genotype).  Due to its 
rarity, hATTR amyloidosis is not yet well known outside of certain specialty centers in a limited 
number of countries.  Often this disease is misdiagnosed, adding to the challenge in providing 
accurate incidence and prevalence data, and individuals carrying a TTR variant may not 
necessarily manifest the disease, further contributing to the challenges in estimating incidence 
and prevalence of the disease. 
The epidemiology of hATTR amyloidosis is summarized in Table 2. 
Table 2: 
Epidemiology of hATTR Amyloidosis  
Incidence 
Estimates of incidence of hATTR amyloidosis are scarce.  Prevalence has been reported somewhat 
more commonly and is discussed below.  While incidence may be estimated from prevalence data in 
conjunction with survival data, the usefulness of doing so is limited by variability in both regional 
prevalence estimates and estimates of survival. 
Prevalence 
hATTR amyloidosis 
The prevalence of hATTR amyloidosis varies depending on the prevalence of individual TTR 
genotypes and the penetrance of those genotypes in a given population.  As the prevalence and 
penetrance of individual TTR genotypes differ across geographic regions, the overall prevalence of the 
disease also shows regional variation.  Further, although terminology has evolved to refer to 
1 hereditary disease with a spectrum of symptoms, as most patients with hATTR amyloidosis 
experience both cardiomyopathy and polyneuropathy over the course of their disease, prevalence data 
often distinguish between hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy and hATTR amyloidosis with 
cardiomyopathy, reflecting a historical view of the disease as having these 2 distinct subtypes, or are 
reported in a genotype-specific manner.  Accordingly, the estimated prevalence of hATTR amyloidosis 
by dominant phenotype at diagnosis (polyneuropathy or cardiomyopathy) or by genotype is presented 
below for various regions.  
hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy: 
In Europe, the largest endemic foci of hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy are in areas with an 
elevated prevalence of carriers of the change from valine to methionine at position 30 (V30M) TTR 
variant.  These foci include Portugal (Póvoa de Varzim and Vila do Conde), where the prevalence of 
the V30M variant is estimated to be 1 in 538 individuals,[Sousa 1995] and northern Sweden where the 
estimated number of V30M TTR carriers was 7500 in a total population of 500,000 .[Holmgren 1994]  
As the phenotypic penetrance of the V30M variant in Northern Portugal was not reported in association 
with the variant prevalence estimate of 1 in 538, it is not possible to discriminate between healthy 
V30M variant carriers and individuals with V30M-hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy, and thus 
estimate the actual prevalence of clinically evident disease, in this population.  In the previously 
mentioned northern Swedish population of 500,000, there were 152 known prevalent cases of V30M-
hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy, corresponding to a disease prevalence rate of 31 cases per 
100,000 population (and a phenotypic penetrance rate of approximately 2% among the 7500 V30M 
carriers). 
The prevalence of hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy in other European countries including 
France, Italy, and Germany is lower than that reported in endemic areas, ranging from 0.06 to 0.82 per 
100,000.  Estimation of prevalence across the European Union (EU) based on available by-country 
prevalence data, together with application of reported prevalence from France (which has a national 
referral network, high disease awareness among physicians, and no endemic foci) to other countries 
without a directly estimated, country-specific prevalence figure, resulted in an estimated overall 
prevalence of hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy of 1.02 per 100,000 in the EU.[Dardiotis 2009; 
Lobato 2003; Munar-Ques 2005; Parman 2016; Plante-Bordeneuve 2007; Rapezzi 2013; Reilly 1995] 
In Japan, hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy is also endemic in some areas as it is in Portugal 
and Sweden; however, the overall prevalence throughout Japan is estimated to be lower than in Europe, 
at approximately 1 in 1,000,000 individuals (0.1 in 100,000).[Kato-Motozaki 2008] 
In the United States (US), the prevalence of hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy is estimated to 
be approximately 2 in 100,000 individuals, based on a 2018 estimate from Coelho and colleagues of 
6400 patients nationwide.[Coelho 2016] 
hATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy: 
The worldwide prevalence of hATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy is unknown, but it is almost 
certainly underdiagnosed, particularly in individuals of African descent who carry the change from 
valine to isoleucine at position 122 (V122I) TTR variant and are older than 65 years.[Buxbaum 2010; 
Dharmarajan 2012] 
The frequency of the V122I TTR genotype in the African American population is 3% to 3.9%, with 
most individuals developing late-onset cardiac amyloidosis in cases where this genotype is clinically 
penetrant.  The frequency of V122I in Caucasian and Hispanic populations in the US is 0.44% and 0%, 
respectively.[Jacobson 1997; Yamashita 2005]  Data on disease penetrance in V122I carriers suggests 
that hATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy in the US population is prevalent in as many as 52,000 
patients (approximately 16 per 100,000).  This is an indirect estimate calculated using the total number 
of African American residents 65 or older, an allele frequency of 3.43%, and a clinical penetrance (that 
is, a probability of the mutation causing the disease) of 33%.  This method is contrasted with the 
method used below to estimate the prevalence of cardiomyopathy in the European Community, which 
relied on directly estimated, country-specific prevalence figures obtained from the published literature 
and other sources.  Therefore, the calculated estimate of prevalence of hATTR amyloidosis with 
cardiomyopathy in the US is likely to be an overestimate of the actual prevalence.  
The prevalence of hATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy is lower in the European Community 
with an estimated prevalence of 0.12 per 100,000; this estimate is based on data in the 
literature,[Frederiksen 1962; Rapezzi 2013] data from the National Amyloidosis Centre in the UK, and 
information from recognized European experts in the field of amyloid transthyretin (ATTR) 
amyloidosis. 
Summary: 
The genotypes that tend to present initially with polyneuropathy contribute more to the overall 
prevalence of hATTR amyloidosis in the EU, while the genotypes that present initially with 
cardiomyopathy are estimated to be more prevalent in the US.  The overall prevalence of hATTR 
amyloidosis can be estimated as approximately 1.02 in 100,000 in the EU and 18 in 100,000 in the US.  
As noted above, the estimate of prevalence of hATTR amyloidosis in the US is likely to be higher than 
the actual prevalence because of the indirect method utilized to derive the US population prevalence of 
hATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy.  The prevalence of hATTR amyloidosis with 
polyneuropathy in Japan is estimated to be approximately 0.1 in 100,000; Japanese prevalence 
estimates for hATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy are not available.  While prevalence data are 
not readily available for regions other than Europe, US, and Japan, it can be concluded that hATTR 
amyloidosis is a rare disease worldwide. 
Demographics of the Target Population (Age, Sex, Race/Ethnic Origin) 
hATTR amyloidosis 
Sex and age at disease onset and diagnosis: 
Overall, hATTR amyloidosis clinical symptoms tend to manifest in adults, and thus the disease is 
typically diagnosed at the adult stage of life.[Ando 2013]  The onset of disease-related symptoms 
varies across different populations and genotypes, with the onset of symptoms potentially occurring 
anywhere from 20 years of age onward.  Adult patients with the V30M TTR genotype can manifest the 
disease at age 30-50 years (early onset) or after age 50 years (late-onset).  Patients with non-V30M 
TTR genotypes typically manifest the disease after age 50 years.  The Transthyretin Amyloidosis 
Outcomes Survey is a global, multicenter, longitudinal, observational survey to collect data on TTR 
amyloidosis (both hereditary and wt).  An evaluation of patients with hATTR amyloidosis who 
enrolled in this registry between December 2007 and September 2011 illustrated the variability among 
different countries and genotypes in not only age at onset, but distribution between male and female 
patients.  The median age of onset of symptoms for patients with the V30M mutation was 33.9 years, 
compared with 54.5 years for patients with other variants, producing a bimodal age-of-onset 
distribution overall.  The male-to-female ratios reported in countries other than the US ranged from 0.7 
in Portugal to 1.9 in Germany.  The male-to-female ratio of patients from the US was 4.6.[Coelho 
2013]  The age, gender distribution, and percentage of patients with V30M in the 225 patients with 
hATTR amyloidosis in the randomized, global, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 pivotal study 
of patisiran (ALN-TTR02-004; Study 004) further illustrate the variability among analyses of 
populations of patients with hATTR amyloidosis.  Median age at entry was 62 years (range 24 to 83), 
median time since diagnosis was 1.37 years, and 74.2% of patients were male.  A total of 96 patients 
(42.7%) possessed the V30M variants. 
Race/ethnic origin of patients with hATTR amyloidosis: 
Hereditary ATTR amyloidosis is a world-wide disease and therefore occurs in patients across a range 
of races and ethnic origins.   
The V30M variants occurs primarily in families with heritage from Portugal, Sweden, and Japan.  
Those patients with the V30M variant and a relatively early age of disease onset (30-50 years) are 
usually from endemic regions within those 3 countries and present with sensory neuropathy, autonomic 
dysfunction, and cardiac conduction disturbances.[Carvalho 1992; Soares 2005] 
Patients with late onset V30M (after age 50) and most non-V30M variants, found in multiple different 
non-endemic regions throughout the world, typically present with motor neuropathy, in addition to 
sensory and autonomic neuropathy, and often have cardiomyopathy and/or heart wall thickening from 
cardiac amyloid involvement.[Ando 2013] 
Certain genotypes, such as the T60A variant, which is associated with persons of Irish descent, the 
I68L variant in Italy, and the V122I variants in persons of west African descent, manifest as hATTR 
amyloidosis that usually starts with a cardiac-predominant phenotype but can include polyneuropathy 
in a large fraction of patients.[Buxbaum 2017; Jacobson 1997; Maurer 2016]  
Existing Treatment Options 
The treatment of hATTR amyloidosis requires a multidisciplinary approach primarily involving 
neurology, gastroenterology, and cardiology specialties.  Historically, palliative/symptomatic therapies 
directed at specific symptoms such as pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea have been the mainstay of 
treatment. 
Patisiran and vutrisiran, RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutics, are approved in the US, EU, Japan, 
and other regions for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hATTR amyloidosis in adults.  These 
therapeutics suppress the production of TTR in the liver by targeting the messenger RNA (mRNA) for 
degradation through RNAi.  Treatment with patisiran or vutrisiran, has been shown to result in 
improvements in neuropathy (modified neuropathy impairment score +7 [mNIS+7]), quality of life 
(Norfolk Quality of Life-Diabetic Neuropathy [Norfolk QOL-DN]), and multiple other disease 
manifestations compared to placebo in patients with hATTR amyloidosis who exhibited a broad range 
of disease severity and TTR genotypes.[Adams 2018; Adams 2021; Adams 2023]  In Study 004 
(APOLLO; which was the basis for the approval of patisiran), the magnitude of TTR reduction 
correlated with the improvement in mNIS+7 score at 18 months, where a higher magnitude of TTR 
reduction led to greater improvements in mNIS+7 score at a population level.  In a threshold analysis 
of mNIS+7 (change from baseline of < 0 points), 56.1% of patisiran-treated patients compared to only 
3.9% of placebo-treated patients experienced improvement in polyneuropathy based on mNIS+7 score 
at 18 months.  In ALN-TTRSC02-002 (HELIOS-A; which was the basis for the approval of vutrisiran), 
treatment with vutrisiran led to rapid and sustained lowering of circulating TTR across all TTR variants 
studied.   
TTR tetramer stabilizers (including tafamidis and diflunisal) act by binding to the thyroxine-binding 
site on TTR to reduce the dissociation of TTR tetramers into misfolded amyloidogenic monomers.  
Tafamidis, an oral TTR tetramer stabilizer, received approval from the European Medicines Agency 
under exceptional circumstances in November 2011 ‘for the treatment of transthyretin amyloidosis in 
adult patients with stage I symptomatic polyneuropathy to delay peripheral neurologic 
impairment.[Pfizer Limited 2011]  Tafamidis has also been authorized for the treatment of hATTR 
amyloidosis with polyneuropathy in Japan and a number of other countries; however, tafamidis has not 
been approved for this use in the US.  Long-term follow-up of early stage patients with the V30M 
variant after initiating tafamidis treatment showed continued neuropathy progression over 
time.[Barroso 2017]  Tafamidis has been reported to be generally well tolerated.[Coelho 2012] 
Diflunisal, a generic, oral, nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory drug that has been demonstrated to bind to 
and stabilize the TTR tetramer in a manner similar to tafamidis, was shown to slow neuropathy 
progression compared with placebo in patients with V30M and non-V30M hATTR amyloidosis with 
both early and late stage neuropathy in a Phase 3 US National Institutes of Health-sponsored study 
(N=130).[Berk 2013]  While used off-label in some countries where available, diflunisal is not an 
approved treatment for hATTR amyloidosis in any country.[Berk 2013]  In the US, diflunisal carries 
boxed warnings for cardiovascular thrombotic events, gastrointestinal risk, and renal injury.[Cadila 
Healthcare Limited 2017]  Overall, the data to date with TTR tetramer stabilizers indicate some 
slowing of neuropathy progression, with effects limited in the case of tafamidis to early stage V30M 
patients. 
The TTR-targeting antisense oligonucleotide inotersen, was authorized in the European Economic Area 
(EEA) on 05 July 2018 for the treatment of hATTR amyloidosis in adult patients with stage 1 or stage 
2 polyneuropathy and authorized in the US on 05 October 2018 for the treatment of the polyneuropathy 
of hATTR amyloidosis in adults.  It is also approved for marketing in Brazil for the treatment of stage 
1 or 2 polyneuropathy in adult patients with hATTR amyloidosis and in Canada for the treatment of 
polyneuropathy of hATTR in adults.  Inotersen showed statistically significant slowing of neuropathy 
progression (measured using a version of the modified Neurologic Impairment Score +7) and quality of 
life (Norfolk QOL-DN) relative to placebo in a randomized Phase 3 trial,[Dyck 2017].  From the Phase 
3 clinical trial, 28 adverse event (AE) data including thrombocytopenia, glomerulonephritis, liver 
enzyme elevations, and 1 case of fatal intracranial hemorrhage have resulted in regulatory requirements 
for routine laboratory monitoring (eg, platelets, kidney function, and liver function) and dosing 
adjustments for at-risk patients. The fibril-disrupting drug combination of doxycycline and 
tauroursodeoxycholic acid,[Adams 2012] is also currently under development, which to date has only 
been tested in small single-arm Phase 2 studies.  A small molecule and an antibody against serum 
amyloid P, a component common to amyloid deposits in systemic amyloidosis, are also in early-stage 
development for the treatment of hATTR amyloidosis.[Pepys 2017; Pepys 2002; Richards 2015]   
Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) eliminates variant TTR from the circulation but does not affect 
the production of wt TTR, which continues to be made by the transplanted liver.  Orthotopic liver 
transplantation is only effective in slowing the progression of disease in patients with an early age of 
onset (<50 years of age),[Okamoto 2009] especially for those with the V30M variant and short disease 
duration before transplant.  Consequently, almost two-thirds of patients with hATTR amyloidosis are 
not transplant-eligible.  Even when OLT is possible, morbidity and mortality are substantial; patients 
require life-long immunosuppressive medications, with their attendant risks of infection and renal 
injury.  One-year mortality rates of up to 10% have been reported.[Bispo 2009; Herlenius 2004; 
Okamoto 2009] 
Natural History of hATTR Amyloidosis 
Overall, hATTR amyloidosis is a rapidly progressive, multisystem disease that results in poor quality 
of life and premature death.  
Polyneuropathy classically manifests as a length-dependent, symmetrical sensorimotor neuropathy 
involving large and small peripheral nerve fibers.[Ando 2013; Benson 2007; Carvalho 1992; Connors 
2004; Soares 2005]  Patients experience painful dysesthesias, loss of sensation, progressive muscle 
atrophy, and motor weakness in both lower and upper limbs.  These symptoms subsequently lead to 
ambulation impairment, frequent falls, and inability to perform activities of daily living such as holding 
eating utensils, buttoning a shirt, or zipping a coat.  Loss of sensation can lead to burns and joint injury 
in the lower limbs.  Furthermore, sensorimotor neuropathy is accompanied by autonomic dysfunction, 
which results in debilitating orthostatic hypotension, severe gastrointestinal symptoms (including early 
satiety, chronic nausea/vomiting, and both diarrhea and constipation), and bladder dysfunction with 
recurrent urinary tract infections.  Amyloid infiltration into cardiac tissue leads to cardiomyopathy 
characterized by heart failure due initially to diastolic dysfunction, followed by systolic dysfunction, as 
well as conduction disturbances, and arrhythmias.[Ando 2013; Benson 2007; Carvalho 1992; Connors 
2004; Soares 2005]  Renal amyloid deposition resulting in proteinuria and renal insufficiency can occur 
with V30M as well as other genotypes such as Gly47Glu and Ser77Tyr.[Lobato 2012]  Ocular 
abnormalities such as keratoconjunctivitis sicca, secondary glaucoma, vitreous deposits, and pupillary 
abnormalities are commonly observed in patients with hATTR amyloidosis due to the underlying 
disease.[Conceicao 2016; Martins 2015; Rousseau 2013]  The constellation of progressive morbidity 
from amyloid infiltration results in severe disability, wasting due to gastrointestinal malabsorption, 
malnutrition, and cardiac cachexia, and profound loss of quality of life.  Death usually results from 
heart failure (including sudden death caused by ventricular arrhythmias or electromechanical 
dissociation) or infection.  The median survival is 4.7 years following diagnosis, [Plante-Bordeneuve 
2011; Swiecicki 2015] with a reduced survival (3.4 years) for patients with ATTR 
cardiomyopathy.[Gertz 1992; Sattianayagam 2012; Swiecicki 2015] 
Important comorbidities 
Patients with hATTR amyloidosis often have poor nutritional status and overall wasting due in part to 
severe gastrointestinal manifestations including frequent episodes of diarrhea.[Ando 2013]  
Furthermore, as late-onset disease manifests in the elderly, diseases commonly associated with aging 
such as osteoarthritis, ocular events, thyroid dysfunction, and malignancies are important co-
morbidities.  Depression may also be an important co-morbidity as a result of this debilitating 
disease.[Lopes 2015] 
In addition to the ocular symptoms that present as manifestations of hATTR amyloidosis,[Rousseau 
2013] dry eye has been reported as well, and decreases in visual acuity are noted as the disease 
progresses.[Ando 2013] 
Neuromuscular diseases are known risk factors for osteoporosis, which may be further exacerbated by 
the gastrointestinal manifestations of the disease leading to malabsorption.  In a study conducted on 
12 patients with V30M FAP, 6 were diagnosed as osteoporotic, and 2 had osteopenia.[Conceicao 2005]  
In a study of patients with diabetes who had neuropathy (N=19) or did not have neuropathy (N=22), 
cortical bone mass in hands and feet was found to be significantly lower in patients with neuropathy.  
Metatarsal fractures were reported in 6 out of 19 patients who had neuropathy, but in none of the 22 
patients who did not have neuropathy.[Cundy 1985] 
Baseline comorbidities in patients in the Phase 3 study of patisiran in patients with hATTR amyloidosis 
with polyneuropathy (Study 004 described above; N=225), as reported in medical history at baseline 
(according to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities [MedDRA] System Organ Classes [SOCs] 
and High-Level Terms), were consistent with those reported in the literature and included cardiac 
disorders in 67% (myocardial disorders, cardiac conduction disorders, supraventricular arrhythmias, 
among others); eye disorders in 44% (including cataracts in 24% and dry eye in 8% of patients); 
gastrointestinal disorders in 71% (primarily diarrhea and gastrointestinal atonic and hypomotility 
disorders); general disorders and administration site conditions in 27% (including asthenic conditions 
in 12% and oedema in 12%); renal and urinary disorders in 28% (bladder and urethral symptoms in 
11%); and vascular disorders in 56% (28% with vascular hypertensive disorders and 28% with vascular 
hypotensive disorders).  Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders were reported in 45% of 
patients at baseline, including intervertebral disc disorders in 9% and metabolic bone disorders in 8%. 
Part II: Module SII 
Nonclinical Part of the Safety Specification 
Executive Summary of Important Nonclinical Findings 
The siRNA in patisiran binds to a conserved sequence in humans and monkeys, and thus is 
pharmacologically active in humans and monkeys, but not in rodents or rabbits.  Liver and 
spleen were the primary organs of toxicity in nonclinical species following intravenous (IV) 
administration of patisiran.  The liver is the primary site of patisiran uptake and accumulation.  
Hepatotoxicity determined the no observed adverse effect levels (NOAELs) in all of the 
nonclinical species.  Other target organs included the lymph nodes (rats only), adrenal gland, 
infusion sites, and testes and epididymis (rats only).  Adverse microscopic changes in the liver 
were correlated with increases in liver-related enzymes in serum and were reversible.  In the 
spleen, histomorphological changes associated with toxicity included lymphoid hyperplasia as 
well as atrophy and necrosis; these changes also tended to recover after treatment.  The incidence 
and severity of these findings did not progress with increased study duration.  Adrenal gland, 
lymph node, and testicular/epididymal findings were confined to the 6-week studies only.  The 
toxicities observed in rats and in monkeys with patisiran were similar to those seen for 
AF-011-1955 (same LNP formulation as patisiran but containing an siRNA directed against 
insect luciferase), overall suggesting that the toxicity is primarily due to the LNP, and potentially 
mostly contributed by the DLin-MC3-DMA component of the LNP rather than the siRNA.  
Transient activation of complement was observed in cynomolgus monkeys, but did not result in 
long-term complement depletion.  Transient increases in some circulating cytokines 
(interleukin-1RA and interleukin-6) were also observed but were not associated with any adverse 
clinical signs.   
Given the role of TTR as a carrier of retinol binding protein (RBP) and thus vitamin A, and of 
thyroxine, studies in monkeys with ALN-TTR01 (a first generation LNP with same siRNA 
[ALN-18328] as patisiran) or with patisiran, confirmed the secondary pharmacological effects 
associated with reductions in TTR, namely reductions, relative to baseline, in RBP (60%), 
vitamin A (90%), and thyroxine (41%).  There were no toxic sequelae to the reductions of 
vitamin A or thyroxine in monkeys after chronic administration of patisiran. 
In safety pharmacology studies in monkeys, there were no observed effects on electrocardiogram 
parameters (including QT intervals) and mean arterial blood pressure at ≤6 mg/kg, although heart 
rate and body temperature were increased at ≥3 mg/kg.  Respiratory parameters and neurological 
examinations were not affected at 3 mg/kg, the only dose evaluated. 
Patisiran was not mutagenic or clastogenic in genetic toxicity studies and was not carcinogenic in 
TgRasH2 mice.  There were no developmental, reproductive, or perinatal/postnatal effects of 
patisiran (or its pharmacologically active rodent surrogate) in rats or rabbits at minimally toxic 
maternal doses.  However, in a dose range-finding embryo-fetal toxicity study in rabbits, 
increases in spontaneous abortions, early resorptions, post-implantation loss, and reductions in 
litter size, embryo-fetal survival, and fetal body weights were observed at doses ≥1 mg/kg, but 
were considered to be secondary to the maternal toxicity observed at these doses. 
Key safety findings from nonclinical studies and the relevance to human usage are summarized 
in Table 3.

Studies 
Relevance to Human Usage 
Toxicity: 
Target Organ Toxicity Identified from Acute and Repeat-Dose Toxicity Studies 
Liver: 
Necrosis (single cell and/or hepatocellular) 
was observed in mice, rats, and monkeys and 
was considered adverse when accompanied 
by increases in 1 or more liver-associated 
enzymes in serum (eg, alanine 
aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate 
aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase 
[ALP], gamma-glutamyltransferase, lactate 
dehydrogenase) and/or total bilirubin 
(TBILI).  The high dose in the 39-week 
monkey study was lowered from 3.0 to 2.0 
mg/kg once every 3 weeks (q3w) after the 
first dose because of adverse elevations in 
ALT and AST.  Increased hepatocellular 
vacuolation was observed in mice, rats, and 
monkeys.  Inflammatory changes were seen 
in mice, rats (highest severity), and monkeys 
and were often accompanied by changes in 
hematology (eg, total and/or differential white 
blood cell counts), fibrinogen, and serum 
chemistry (albumin and globulin).  Sinus 
histiocytosis and reactive sinusoidal lining 
cells (including Kupffer cells) were seen in 
nonclinical species.  Hepatic findings were 
partially or completely reversible.  Maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) or no observed adverse 
effect levels (NOAELs) in repeat-dose studies 
were based on hepatotoxicity observed at 
higher doses and were 6 mg/kg once every 2 
weeks (q2w) (MTD) in mice, 0.1 mg/kg/q2w 
(NOAEL) in rats, and 1.0 mg/kg/q2w or q3w 
in monkeys. 
Spleen and Lymph Nodes: 
Lymphoid depletion/atrophy/necrosis was 
seen in the white pulp and marginal zone of 
the spleen in mice at 10 mg/kg/q2w and rats 
(≥0.15 mg/kg/q2w and 1 mg/kg once every 
4 weeks [q4w]) and was considered adverse 
at ≥0.8 mg/kg/q2w in rats because of marked 
The liver and spleen are the primary target organs of 
patisiran uptake and target organs of toxicity in rats 
and monkeys.  There was no progression of toxicity 
with chronic dosing, and there appeared to be a trend 
toward recovery/reversibility in the nonclinical 
studies.  In the clinical trials, analysis of hepatic AEs 
has shown no clinically important difference between 
placebo- and patisiran-treated patients and no increase 
in the overall pooled experience across the studies.  A 
small increase of ALT and AST was observed in the 
patisiran group compared to placebo that remained 
stable over the 18-month treatment period.  The mean 
change from baseline in ALT and AST was not 
associated with changes in ALP or TBILI. Across the 
3 studies, ALT and AST have continued to remain 
stable over time for periods up to 84.9 months.  
As hepatotoxicity was observed in the nonclinical 
studies in rodents and monkeys and clinical data on 
longer term use are unknown, hepatic disorders are 
addressed as an important potential risk as 
summarized in Section Part II: Module SVII. 
Evaluation of AE data from the clinical trials reveals 
no safety concerns with respect to infections or 
malignancies related to abnormal lymphoid function. 
Relevance to Human Usage 
Clinical trial data revealed no safety concerns related 
to decreased adrenal cortical function. 
Clinical trial data revealed no safety concerns related 
to the infusion sites. 
Clinical trial data revealed no safety concerns related 
to nonclinical findings in the testes and epididymis.

Studies 
severity.  Histiocytosis was observed in the 
white pulp of spleen in rats at 
≥0.15 mg/kg/q2w and at 0.1 mg/kg/q4w.  No 
decreases in circulating lymphocytes or other 
signs of immunotoxicity were seen.  
Increased extramedullary hematopoeisis, at 
times deemed secondary to inflammation, 
was seen in rats at ≥0.15 mg/kg/q2w and 
mice at ≥1 mg/kg/q2w.  Non-adverse red pulp 
hypocellularity was seen in monkeys at 
3 mg/kg/q2w and 3.0/2.0 mg/kg/q3w.  
Splenic changes in rodents and monkeys were 
reversible.  In rats, reversible lymphoid and 
stromal cell hyperplasia, histiocytosis, and 
inflammation in lymph nodes were observed 
in the 6-week toxicity study at 
≥0.15 mg/kg/q2w only.  No lymph node 
findings were noted in mice or monkeys. 
Adrenal Gland: 
In a 6-week rat study, reversible cortical 
hypertrophy was observed at the end of the 
dosing phase at ≥0.8 mg/kg/q2w; 
degeneration/necrosis at corticomedullary 
junction was observed after 60-day recovery 
period at ≥0.15 mg/kg/q2w.  In a 6-week 
monkey study, reversible decreases in cortical 
vacuolation were observed at 3 mg/kg/q2w.  
No findings were noted in subsequent rat and 
monkey studies of longer duration.  
Injection/Infusion Sites: 
Reversible vascular/perivascular 
inflammation occurred in mice at ≥1 
mg/kg/q2w, in rats at ≥0.03 mg/kg/q2w, and 
in monkeys at 3 mg/kg/q2w and was 
associated with inflammatory changes in 
hematology (total and differential white blood 
cell count), fibrinogen, and serum chemistry 
(albumin and globulin). 
Testes and Epididymis: 
In a 6-week rat study, adverse uni- or bilateral 
degeneration/atrophy of seminiferous 
epithelium and oligo/aspermia in epididymis 
were observed at low incidence at the end of 
dosing and recovery phases at 
≥0.15 mg/kg/q2w.  No findings were noted in 
subsequent rat studies or in any of the 
Relevance to Human Usage 
In animal studies, patisiran had no adverse effects on 
male or female fertility, pregnancy, or embryo-fetal 
development at doses that did not result in maternal 
toxicity.  Despite marked reductions in circulating 
vitamin A in rats after administration of the rodent-
specific surrogate, there were no effects on fertility, 
reproductive outcomes, embryo-fetal or 
postnatal/perinatal development.  Components of the 
LNP formulation were detected in the milk of rats in low 
levels relative to their concomitant plasma levels. 
No data are available on the use of patisiran in 
pregnant or lactating women.  The effects of maternal 
serum TTR reduction or serum vitamin A reduction on 
the human fetus are unknown. 
There are no data on the effects of patisiran on human 
fertility.  No impact on male or female fertility was 
detected in animal studies. 
The use of patisiran in pregnant or lactating women is 
considered missing information as summarized in Part 
II: Module SVII. 
Key Safety Findings from Nonclinical 
Studies 
monkey studies, including the 39-week study 
that employed sexually mature animals in 
which male reproductive parameters (ie, 
volume, color, appearance, sperm 
concentration, motility and morphology, and 
testis measurement) and spermatogenic cycle 
were evaluated.  No effects were observed in 
a male fertility study at ≤0.3 mg/kg/q2w 
(highest dose tested) in which rats were dosed 
for 10 weeks (a full cycle of spermatogenesis) 
prior to mating. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity: 
Fertility: 
No effects on mating or fertility were 
observed at ≤0.3 mg/kg/q2w (highest dose 
tested) in male rats (patisiran was 
administered q2w for 10 weeks prior to 
mating) or on estrus cycling, mating, or 
fertility at ≤1.5 mg/kg (highest dose tested) in 
female rats (patisiran was administered 15, 8, 
and 1 day prior to mating).  No effects on 
male reproductive parameters in sexually 
mature monkeys were observed at 
≤3.0/2.0 mg/kg/q3w (highest dose tested). 
Embryo-Fetal and Developmental 
Toxicology: 
Little to no fetal exposure to ALN-18328, 
DLin-MC3-DMA, or PEG2000-C-DMG was 
observed in rats and rabbits. 
No effects on pregnancy or embryo-fetal 
development were observed in rats at 
≤1.5 mg/kg when patisiran was administered 
15, 8, and 1 day prior to cohabitation and on 
Gestation Days (GDs) 6, 13, and 19.  No 
effects were observed on pregnancy or 
embryo-fetal development when a rodent-
specific surrogate formulated in the same 
LNP as patisiran was administered at 1.5 
mg/kg by the same schedule and elicited 
reductions in serum TTR protein (>95% from 
baseline) and vitamin A (88% from controls).  
No effects were observed on embryo-fetal 
development in rabbits at ≤0.6 mg/kg 
(patisiran administered on GDs 7, 13, and 
19).  In a dose range-finding study in rabbits, 
increases in spontaneous abortions, early

Studies 
resorptions, postimplantation loss, reductions 
in litter size, embryo-fetal survival, and fetal 
body weights at ≥1 mg/kg (patisiran 
administered on GDs 7, 13, and 19) were 
considered to be secondary to the maternal 
toxicity observed at these doses.  
Peri/Postnatal Developmental Toxicity in 
Rats: 
No ALN-18328 was detected in milk from 
rats at 2 hours post-dose on Lactation Day 
(LD) 12.  Milk DLin-MC3-DMA and 
PEG2000-C-DMG concentrations were ≤7% of 
concomitant maternal plasma concentrations. 
There were no effects on gestation, 
parturition, lactation, or maternal behavior or 
on peri/postnatal development in offspring at 
≤1.5 mg/kg (highest dose tested) when 
patisiran administered on GDs 7, 13, and 19 
and on LDs 6, 12, and 18.  No effects were 
observed on these parameters in rats 
administered the rat-active surrogate LNP at 
1.5 mg/kg by the same schedule despite 
reductions in serum TTR protein (90-100% 
from baseline), vitamin A (67-75% from 
control), and thyroxine (66% from baseline). 
Carcinogenicity and Genotoxicity 
Patisiran was not carcinogenic at 
≤6 mg/kg/q2w (highest dose tested) in a 
26-week study in TgRasH2 mice.
Patisiran was not genotoxic in bacterial 
mutagenesis, chromosomal aberration, or 
mouse bone marrow micronucleus tests. 
Drug Abuse and Liability Assessment 
Based on a review of the nonclinical 
findings, there was no evidence of significant 
drug distribution to the brain, effects on 
central nervous system (CNS) activity, 
behavior, or neurological examinations. 
Relevance to Human Usage 
There is no evidence that patisiran is carcinogenic in 
humans based on the nonclinical studies.  The 
pharmacologic mode of action does not pose an 
increased risk for carcinogenicity.  In clinical studies, 
malignancies were reported in similar percentages of 
patients treated with patisiran and placebo and were at 
a rate consistent with the expected rate for the general 
population.  No cases of malignancy were considered 
related to treatment. 
There is no evidence that patisiran has a potential for 
abuse in humans, based on findings in both the 
nonclinical and clinical programs. 
Key Safety Findings from Nonclinical 
Studies 
Safety Pharmacology: 
Based on its physiochemical properties, 
patisiran has a low likelihood of direct 
cardiac ion channel interactions or delaying 
ventricular repolarization.  Single intravenous 
(IV) doses at ≤6 mg/kg (highest dose tested)
did not result in QT prolongation or
electrocardiogram abnormalities in monkeys.
Heart rate and body temperature were
increased at ≥3 mg/kg; these did not fully
recover to baseline values.  No effects were
seen on the respiratory or central nervous
systems at 3 mg/kg (only dose tested).  No
CNS-related or respiratory system-related
clinical observations were noted in repeat-
dose monkey toxicity studies at ≤3
mg/kg/q2w or at ≤3/2 mg/kg/q3w (highest
doses tested).
Other Toxicity-related Information: 
Drug-drug interactions: 
The components of patisiran were not 
inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450 
(CYP) enzymes or transporters in in vitro 
assays.  ALN-18328 and PEG2000-C-DMG are 
not substrates of CYP enzymes.  Although 
approximately 26% of DLin-MC3-DMA was 
metabolized by CYP3A4 (in an in vitro assay 
with human CYP supersomes), clinically 
relevant drug-drug interactions are not 
expected. 
Secondary pharmacology: 
Repeated administration of patisiran to 
monkeys at ≤3 mg/kg/q2w or ≤3/2 
mg/kg/q3w resulted in mean maximum 
reductions, relative to baseline, in vitamin A 
(90%) and thyroxine (41%) as well as mean 
maximum reductions in the primary 
pharmacodynamics effect of serum TTR 
(98%).  No effects were noted on the eye or 
thyroid gland. 
Relevance to Human Usage 
There is no evidence that patisiran causes corrected 
QT interval prolongation, as findings from nonclinical 
and clinical studies do not suggest that patisiran has 
the potential to delay ventricular repolarization. 
No formal drug interaction clinical studies have been 
performed.  Patisiran is not expected to cause drug-
drug interactions or to be affected by inhibitors or 
inducers of CYP.  The components of patisiran are not 
inhibitors or inducers of CYP enzymes or transporters. 
The risk of development of vitamin A deficiency in 
patients receiving patisiran is expected to be low, as 
transport and tissue uptake of vitamin A can occur in 
the absence of RBP.[Biesalski 1999; Episkopou 1993; 
van Bennekum 2001]  In the patisiran program, there 
have been no safety concerns related to apparent 
vitamin A deficiency, either in the evaluation of 
reported AEs or in serial ophthalmic evaluations 
(including electroretinography).  As was done in the 
clinical studies, patients should be instructed to take 
the daily recommended amount of supplemental 
vitamin A.  Because of a theoretical risk, despite the 
lack of evidence in the clinical development program, 
consequences of vitamin A deficiency is addressed as

an important potential risk as summarized in Part II: 
Module SVII. 
Immunogenicity to biotherapeutic drugs in 
nonclinical species is not generally predictive of the 
potential immunogenicity in humans.  The 
immunogenic response to patisiran in humans was 
evaluated in a placebo-controlled Phase 3 study 
through measurement of ADA directed against 
PEG2000-C-DMG, a lipid component of patisiran.  The 
overall frequency of treatment-emergent ADAs in 
patients treated with patisiran group was 3.6%. ADA 
titers were low and transient with no evidence of an 
effect on clinical response or on the pharmacokinetic 
and pharmacodynamic profiles of patisiran.  There 
was no association of ADA with any safety concerns, 
including infusion-related reactions (IRRs), 
anaphylactic reactions, or hypersensitivity events. 
Changes in CRP and complement split product Bb 
were seen in early clinical studies; however, these 
findings were not correlated with clinical signs. 
Immunogenicity: 
Antidrug antibodies (ADA) measured as IgG, 
IgM, or IgG+IgM directed against the 
PEG2000-C-DMG component of patisiran were 
observed in rats and monkeys.  In the 6- and 
4-week rat and in the 6-and 39-week studies
in monkeys, there were no apparent effects on
exposure or any associated clinical signs.  In
the 26-week study in rats, ADA were detected
in approximately 50% of the rats (all dose
groups), and systemic exposure to
ALN-18328, DLin-MC3-DMA, and
PEG2000-C-DMG was altered.  This may have
explained the lack of target organ toxicity
observed in this study
(NOAEL=0.3 mg/kg/q2w, the highest dose
tested).
Immunostimulation: 
Transient (<24 h) increases, relative to 
control, were observed in circulating 
interleukin 6, interferon gamma-induced 
protein 10, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 
1, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, 
in mice after a single dose at ≥7.5 mg/kg.  
Increased serum/plasma levels of 
complement split product Bb and/or C3a, 
cytokines interleukin-6 and interleukin-1 
receptor antagonist, and C-reactive protein 
(CRP) were observed in monkeys 15 min to 
48 h after patisiran at ≥1.0 mg/kg/q2w.  No 
associated clinical signs were observed.  No 
depletion of Factor B, C3, and CH50 
(functional complement) occurred in 
monkeys dosed for 39 weeks at ≤3.0/2.0 
mg/kg/q3w (highest dose tested). 
Nonclinical findings that may have relevance to humans are the following: 
•
Important potential risks:
− Consequences of vitamin A deficiency
− Hepatic Disorders
• Missing information:  Use in pregnancy and lactation
Part II: Module SIII  Clinical Trial Exposure 
The clinical development program for patisiran consists of 2 clinical trials in healthy volunteers 
(ALN-TTR02-001; Study 001 and ALN-TTR02-005; Study 005), 5 clinical trials in patients with 
hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy:  a Phase 2 multiple ascending dose study (ALN-
TTR02-002; Study 002), a Phase 2 open-label extension study (ALN-TTR02-003; Study 003), a 
double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled pivotal Phase 3 study (ALN-TTR02-004 
[APOLLO]; Study 004), a global open-label Phase 3 extension study (ALN-TTR02-006; Study 
006), and an open-label study in patients post liver transplant (ALN-TTR02-008; Study 008), 
and 1 clinical trial in patients with ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy: a Phase 3, 
double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter study in patients with ATTR 
amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy (ALN-TTR02-011 [APOLLO-B]; Study 011).  Patisiran was 
also given as a reference comparator in Study ALN-TTRSC02-002 in patients with hATTR 
amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. See Table 4 for study details.   
In addition to the clinical trials described above, patisiran was also administered to patients with 
hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy via an Expanded Access Protocol (EAP, 
ALN-TTR02-007; Study 007) in the US and under Compassionate Use Programs (CUPs) 
worldwide and to patients with ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy via EAP, 
ALN-TTR02-014; Study 014) conducted in the US.  These programs are further described in 
Part II: Module SV.

b  The rate of infusion was approximately 3.3 mL/min in Study ALN-TTR02-001.  In Study ALN-TTR02-002, Cohorts 1 through 6 received the IV infusion at 
the rate of 3.3 mL/min (approximately 60-minute infusion), while a rate of 1.1 mL/min during the first 15 minutes, and approximately 3.3 mL/min for the 
remainder of the infusion (approximately 80-minute infusion) was used with Cohorts 7 through 9.  For all other studies, the rate of approximately 1 mL/min for 
the first 15 minutes followed by approximately 3 mL/min for the remainder of the infusion was utilized; the total infusion time was approximately 80 minutes. 
c  This includes all patients who received at least 1 dose of patisiran, including patients treated with patisiran during the DB Period (N=181) and patients initially 
treated with placebo during the DB Period and switched to patisiran during the OLE Period (N=166; data cutoff date 09 August 2023). 
Sources:  Study 004 (final data:  14 September 2017), Study 003 (final data:  27 September 2016), Study 006 (final database lock:  07 December 2022), Study 
008 (final data: 11 December 2020), ALN-TTRSC02-002 (interim data: 20 October 2021; all active patients who received patisiran as a reference comparator 
have been switched to vutrisiran), and Study 011 (interim data: 09 August 2023). 
In the patisiran development program, a total of 291 patients with hATTR amyloidosis with 
polyneuropathy (Studies 002, 003, 004, 006, 008, and the patisiran arm of ALN-TTRSC02-002), 
347 patients with ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy (Study 011), and 22 healthy 
volunteers have received at least 1 dose of patisiran.  The healthy volunteers received single 
doses as described in Table 4.   
The 29 patients in Study 002 each received 2 doses in the dosing groups described above.  All 
but 2 of those patients enrolled in the completed Phase 2 extension study (Study 003) and, as for 
all remaining patients receiving patisiran in the clinical development program (Study 004 and 
Study 006), received doses of 0.3 mg/kg every 3 weeks.  Exposure data from the 2 patients from 
Study 002 who did not enroll in Study 003 are not included in the pooled data (see below).  One 
of the patients in the 0.3 mg/kg dose q3w cohort withdrew from Study 002 early after receiving 1 
dose of patisiran, and 1 patient in the 0.3 mg/kg q4w cohort completed the 2 doses of patisiran in 
Study 002 then moved to another country and did not wish to continue patisiran treatment. 
A total of 23 patients with hATTR amyloidosis with disease progression post-OLT received at 
least 1 dose of patisiran (0.3 mg/kg every 3 weeks) in Study 008.  Twenty-two patients 
completed the study.  One of the patients discontinued study treatment after receiving 1 dose of 
patisiran due to a patient decision.  Exposure data from Study 008 are included in the pooled 
data. 
Additionally, 42 patients have been exposed to patisiran as the comparator in an ongoing 
Phase 3, global, randomized, open-label clinical study investigating vutrisiran with hATTR 
amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (ALN-TTRSC02-002) during the 18 months treatment period.  
Vutrisiran is being developed for the same indication as patisiran but with a subcutaneous route 
of administration.  In ALN-TTRSC02-002, patients were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive 
vutrisiran or patisiran, respectively, and patient enrollment is complete.  Patisiran exposure data 
from ALN-TTRSC02-002 are included in the pooled data. 
Exposure data are summarized in further detail for the 289 patients with hATTR amyloidosis 
with polyneuropathy who have been exposed to at least 1 dose of patisiran in Studies 003, 004, 
006, 008, or ALN-TTRSC02-002.  All exposure data are final with Study 006 (open-label Phase 
3 extension study) completed on 23 November 2022 (Final Database lock: 07 December 2022). 
Exposure data are also summarized for the 347 patients with wt transthyretin-mediated 
amyloidosis (wtATTR) or hATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy who have been exposed to 
at least 1 dose of patisiran in Study 011 as of the data cutoff date of 09 August 2023. 
Clinical trial exposure to patisiran in ATTR amyloidosis patients is presented in Table 5, 
Table 6, and Table 7. 
The overall cumulative patient exposure to patisiran based on the Pooled Data (N=636) was 
1887.1 patient-years.

SIV.1 
Exclusion Criteria in the Pivotal Clinical Studies within the Development 
Program  
The exclusion criteria used in the pivotal Phase 3 placebo-controlled Study 004 in 
polyneuropathy were selected primarily to enroll patients able to withstand the rigors of 
participating in a clinical study and to avoid enrolling patients with medical conditions or 
treatments that could potentially confound the assessment of the safety or efficacy of patisiran. 
Key exclusion criteria from the pivotal Phase 3 Study 004 are presented in Table 8 with a 
determination of whether the criterion is considered as missing information. 
Other exclusion criteria from Study 004 that were designed to ensure patients could participate in 
the study or to avoid confounding efficacy and safety results not presented in Table 8 are listed 
below.  Based on nonclinical and clinical observations, patients with these criteria are not 
expected to be at a higher risk of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) from patisiran than the overall 
population. 
• Other known causes of sensorimotor or autonomic neuropathy (Study 004).
• Type I diabetes (any length of time)
• Type II diabetes (for ≥5 years)
• Vitamin B12 deficiency
• Untreated hypo- or hyperthyroidism
• Previous investigational agents or devices (within 30 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is
longer), antisense oligonucleotide therapy (within 3 months), or (Study 004) TTR tetramer
stabilizers (within 14 days [3 days for diflunisal])
• Has had (within 3 months) or was planning a major surgery
• HIV or any infections requiring systemic antiviral treatment
• Malignancies  within  2  years  (except  for  basal  or  squamous  cell  carcinoma  of  the  skin  or
carcinoma in situ of the cervix that was successfully treated),
• Acute coronary syndrome within 3 months
• Uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia or unstable angina
• Known history of alcohol abuse within the past 2 years or daily heavy consumption
• An anticipated survival less than 2 years

polyneuropathy due to 
causes other than 
hATTR amyloidosis.  
Furthermore, patisiran 
is not distributed to the

Limitations to Detect Adverse Reactions in the Clinical Trial Development 
Program  
In the pooled data across Studies 003, 004, 006, 008, 011, and the patisiran arm of ALN-
TTRSC02-002, 636 patients with wtATTR or hATTR amyloidosis were exposed to patisiran for 
approximately 1887.1 person-years (Table 5); the clinical safety data would enable detection of 
very common (incidence of ≥1/10) and common (≥1/100 to <1/10) ADRs and ADRs with a 
frequency as low as 1 in 514 per patient-years of exposure associated with patisiran.  The 
patisiran clinical safety data are unlikely to allow detection of ADRs that are rare (≥1/10,000 to 
<1/1000) or very rare (<1/10,000). 
In the pooled patient population, 580 patients have been exposed to patisiran for ≥12 months, 
366 patients for ≥24 months, 195 patients for ≥36 months, 167 patients for ≥48 months, 
144 patients for ≥60 months, 125 patients for ≥72 months, and 24 patients for ≥84 months 
(Table 5).  Based on the available data, there are no known patisiran ADRs that have a long 
latency, are due to prolonged exposure, or are due to cumulative effects.

Part II: Module SV 
Post-Authorization Experience 
Patisiran is indicated for the treatment of hATTR amyloidosis in adult patients with stage 1 or 
stage 2 polyneuropathy.  Cumulative global patient exposure to patisiran from marketing 
experience was calculated from internal sales data and patient counts collected since the 
International Birth Date of patisiran through 09 August 2023 (sales data) and 31 July 2023 
(patient counts). 
The following methodology for estimating post-marketing patient-years exposure to patisiran 
was used. 
Patisiran is supplied in vials, each containing 10,000 µg patisiran.  The recommended dose of 
patisiran is 300 µg/kg administered via IV infusion once every 21 days.  Considering the average 
patient weight of 68 kg, the average daily dose of patisiran taken by a single patient is 
approximately 971.43 µg/day.  The 365.25 days per year estimate was used to convert exposure 
from patient-days to patient-years. 
Therefore, the following formula was used for the calculation of the estimated patient-years 
exposure to patisiran in the post-marketing experience: 
Number of 
patient-years=
Number of vials sold×10,000 µg patisiran 
Average daily dose×365.25 days 
The estimate of the number of patients treated with patisiran is based on the best available 
information from multiple sources, from firm and verifiable numbers to unverifiable numbers 
(eg, internal sources at a region or country level). 
SV.1 
Post-authorization Exposure 
Commercial exposure to patisiran 
Cumulatively, as of 09 August 2023, 297,025 vials of patisiran had been sold worldwide, 
corresponding to an estimated 8371.27 patient-years exposure, and cumulatively, as of 
31 July 2023, it was estimated that 2834 patients had been treated with patisiran. 
The cumulative number of patisiran vials sold, estimated patient-years exposure, and estimated

Exposure from Early Access Programs in patients with hATTR Amyloidosis with 
polyneuropathy 
Prior to being marketed, an open-label expanded access protocol ALN-TTR02-007 in the US and 
CUPs in Europe for patisiran generated preliminary safety data comparable to the information 
collected in the post-authorization setting.  Exposure information pertaining to these programs is 
presented in this section.  
The EAP Study ALN-TTR02-007 in patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy had 
a first patient enrolled in December 2016 in the US.  Exposure data as of 28 January 2021 (ALN-
TTR02-007 summary report date) were calculated based on 154 patients enrolled and dosed in 
the EAP.  The median duration of patisiran exposure in Study ALN-TTR02-007 was 336 days 
(range, 21 to 777), with 41 (26.6%) patients receiving 271 to 360 days of patisiran.  Cumulative 
study drug exposure was 159.3 patient-years. 
The EAP Study ALN-TTR02-014 in patients with ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy had 
an additional 191 new patients that received patisiran as of the DLP of this report. 
Cumulatively, as of 09 August 2023, 25,243 vials of patisiran had been distributed to 572 
patients enrolled in early access programs and CUPs worldwide, corresponding to an estimated 
711.44 patient-years exposure.

Part II: Module SVI  Additional EU Requirements for the Safety 
Specification 
SVI.1 
Potential for Misuse for Illegal Purposes 
Patisiran is a double-stranded, liver-directed siRNA that reduces TTR.  Given the size of 
patisiran drug substance (~14 kDa), it is unable to pass through the blood-brain barrier and is not 
expected to exert any direct effect on the central nervous system.  As such, patisiran is unlikely 
to affect neurotransmitter systems associated with abuse potential.  From the clinical trial data, 
the safety profile does not suggest any type of rewarding/stimulatory effects or other abuse-
related behaviors with patisiran use. 
Based on the chemical properties, mechanism of action, route of administration, and evaluations 
of AEs associated with the potential for drug abuse, patisiran has a low potential for abuse, and 
there is no potential for misuse of patisiran for illegal purposes. 
Other Safety Topics 
The following safety topics are also considered unlikely to pose a risk with patisiran:  overdose, 
transmission of infectious agents, medication errors, off-label use, and pediatric issues.  Patisiran 
is manufactured and prepared in controlled settings and administered by healthcare 
professionals; these measures minimize the potential for overdose, medication errors, misuse, 
abuse, off-label use, and transmission of infectious agents.  Because hATTR amyloidosis 
manifests in adults, patisiran is not anticipated nor recommended to be administered to pediatric 
patients. 
Part II: Module SVII   Identified and Potential Risks 
SVII.1 
Identification of Safety Concerns in the Initial RMP Submission 
Potential safety areas of interest based on therapeutic class, observations from nonclinical 
studies, the mechanism of action of patisiran-LNP, and disease-related pathophysiology of 
hATTR amyloidosis were identified and evaluated in the patisiran-LNP clinical development 
program.  Particular attention was given to the double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled 
pivotal Phase 3 study ALN-TTR02-004 (Study 004), because this study afforded an opportunity 
to compare AEs in patients receiving patisiran-LNP with those in patients receiving placebo, thus 
isolating drug effects from disease- and age-related effects.  Among the areas of interest listed 
below, only infusion-related reactions (IRRs) emerged as an important identified risk, due to an 
imbalance in the occurrence of IRRs between treatment groups (see Observed Adverse Drug 
Reactions, below).  The other categories of events listed occurred in similar percentages of 
patients in both treatment groups and are therefore not considered safety concerns for 
patisiran-LNP.  Hepatic disorders has been included as an important potential risk based on the 
nonclinical observations.  Refer to 2.7.4, Section 2.1.5 Analysis of Adverse Events by Organ 
System or Syndrome. 
• Based on nonclinical observations:  hepatobiliary events and thyroid disorders
• Based on known occurrence with lipid nanoparticle drugs:  IRRs
• Based on disease manifestations:  cardiac events, renal events, ocular events, and
metabolic bone disorders
• Considering a common comorbidity of hATTR amyloidosis:  depression/suicidality
• Considering the overall age of the patient population:  malignancies.
The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) groupings of System Organ 
Classes (SOCs) and Standardized MedDRA Queries (SMQs) were utilized to summarize 
groupings of AEs, as were individual preferred terms and, in the case of IRRs, specific 
instructions were given to investigators to evaluate whether an AE was considered an IRR. 
Observed Adverse Drug Reactions: 
In addition to the groupings above, which allow for identification of possible safety concerns by 
evaluating the occurrence of similar AEs, an imbalance between treatment arms of individual 
treatment-emergent AEs can indicate that they might be related to the treatment. 
Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) identified in Study 004 are listed below.  These are treatment-
emergent AEs that occurred more frequently in patients in the patisiran-LNP group compared to 
patients in the placebo group by at least 3 percentage points, and they include IRRs, listed above. 
•
Infusion-related reactions (IRRs:  18.9% vs 9.1%)
• Oedema peripheral (29.7% vs 22.1%)
• Vertigo (5.4% vs 1.3%)
• Dyspnoea (6.8% vs 0)
• Muscle spasms (8.1% vs 1.3%)
• Dyspepsia (8.1% vs 3.9%)
• Arthralgia (7.4% vs 0)
• Erythema (6.8% vs 2.6%)
• Bronchitis (6.1% vs 2.6%)
• Sinusitis (4.1% vs 0)
• Rhinitis (4.1% vs 0)
In addition, extravasation can occur with any medicinal product administered by intravenous 
(IV) infusion.  Extravasation was observed in <0.5% of infusions. Signs and symptoms included
phlebitis or thrombophlebitis, infusion or injection site swelling, dermatitis (subcutaneous
inflammation), cellulitis, erythema, or injection site redness, burning sensation, or injection site
pain.

Adverse Drug Reactions Not Considered Important for Inclusion in the List 
of Safety Concerns in the RMP 
The identified ADRs above that are not considered important for inclusion in the list of safety 
concerns for patisiran-LNP are outlined below.   
Reason for Not Including an Identified ADR in the List of Safety Concerns in the RMP: 
• ADRs with minimal clinical impact on patients (in relation to the severity of the
indication treated):  muscle spasms, dyspepsia, arthralgia, erythema, bronchitis,
sinusitis, and rhinitis.  None of these AEs caused discontinuation and with the
exception of 1 case of severe dyspepsia, all events were mild or moderate in severity.
Events of extravasation were mild or moderate in severity.  There have been no
reports of tissue injury or damage and all events resolved.  Considering the severe,
progressive, and ultimately fatal nature of hATTR amyloidosis, these risks are
considered to have minimal clinical impact.
• Risks evaluated in further detail and also determined not to represent important
identified risks:
− Oedema peripheral:  In Study 004, oedema peripheral was reported in 29.7% of
patients in the patisiran-LNP group and 22.1% of patients in the placebo group.
In this study, 56.0% of patients overall met predefined criteria for cardiac
involvement (baseline left ventricular wall thickness ≥1.3 cm and no aortic valve
disease or hypertension in medical history), and in this cardiac subpopulation,
oedema peripheral was reported in 32.2% of patients in patisiran-LNP group vs
25.0% in the placebo group.  In the overall population, the proportion of patients
who experienced oedema peripheral in the patisiran-LNP group decreased over
the course of the study:  during the first 9 months, the percentage of patients with
oedema peripheral during each 3-month interval had a range of 7.6% to 10.8%;
during the second 9 months, the percentage during each 3-month interval had a
range of 2.1% to 6.5%.  In contrast, in the placebo group, the proportion of
patients with reports of oedema peripheral showed an increasing trend.  During
the first 9 months oedema peripheral reports had a range of 4.0% to 7.5%, and 
during the second 9 months had a range of 5.9% to 12.5%.  All the AEs of 
oedema peripheral were mild or moderate in severity.  Oedema peripheral was 
considered related to study drug in only 1 patient in the patisiran-LNP group and 
in 5 patients in the placebo group.  No patients discontinued treatment due to 
oedema peripheral; 1 patient in the placebo group had an infusion cycle delay.  
Data from the pooled analysis of the 218 patients treated with patisiran-LNP in 
completed Study 003, completed Study 004, and interim data (14 July 2017) from 
Study 006 are consistent with the placebo-controlled data with respect to reported 
events of oedema peripheral; there were no discontinuations due to oedema 
peripheral.  Refer to 2.7.4, Section 2.1.1.2 Adverse Events. 
− Vertigo:  In Study 004, vertigo was reported for 8 patients in the patisiran-LNP
group (5.4% of patients) and 1 in the placebo group (1.3% of patients).  A review
of individual patient profiles revealed that in the patisiran-LNP group, 7 of 8
patients who reported vertigo had symptoms in the context of orthostatic
hypotension, systemic cardiovascular disorders, fatigue, and asthenia, all related
to hATTR amyloidosis.  These events reported as vertigo did not lead to specific
investigations to validate a true vertigo diagnosis as they were mild, transient, and
assessed by the investigator as not related to study drug.  One patient who had an
ongoing medical history of dizziness due to nervous disorders related to
amyloidosis, cardiomyopathy, heart failure, heart conduction disorders, and
episodes of syncope experienced 2 episodes of vertigo on study, 1 severe and 1
mild.  Both events were transient, and no specific investigations were conducted
to validate a diagnosis of vertigo.  Both reported events for this patient were
deemed not related to study drug, but rather related to orthostatic hypotension due
to amyloidosis.  These events did not result in any change of dose or study drug
administration process.  Data from the pooled analysis of 218 patients who
received patisiran-LNP in completed Study 003, completed Study 004, and
interim data (14 July 2017) from Study 006 are consistent with the placebo-
controlled data with respect to reported events of vertigo.  Vertigo did not cause
discontinuation in this larger group of patients exposed to patisiran-LNP for a
longer time.  Overall, it is not clear that most of these events were true vertigo,
but rather may have been dizziness related to underlying disease manifestations.
Refer to 2.7.4, Section 2.1.1.2 Adverse Events.
− Dyspnoea:  In Study 004, 10 patients (6.8%, 14 events) in the patisiran-LNP
group reported dyspnoea, compared with no patients in the placebo group.  All of
the events were considered by the investigators to be not related or unlikely
related to study drug.  The majority of the patients had a medical history of
cardiac disorders, with dyspnoea reported by 6 patients (6.7%, 8 events) in the
patisiran-LNP group in the predefined cardiac subpopulation.  When dyspnoea
was analyzed over time, the proportion of patients and number of events
decreased over time (first 9 months:  2.0-2.1%, 10 events; second 9 months:
0.7-1.4%, 4 events).  Most of the events were mild or moderate in severity, none
caused discontinuation, and none were deemed related to study treatment.  Two
patients in the patisiran-LNP group had single events of dyspnoea that were
considered severe.  Neither of the events was considered an IRR, and no action 
was taken with the study drug (ie, dose not changed).  One patient who had been 
having worsening dyspnoea due to congestive heart failure and associated chest 
discomfort was admitted to the hospital (thus meeting a criterion for a serious 
adverse event [SAE]) for evaluation and treatment of worsening orthostatic 
hypotension.  The patient’s medications were adjusted, and the event resolved.  
The event was considered not related to study drug.  These data suggest that 
during patisiran-LNP study treatment, dyspnoea was often indicative of 
underlying cardiac disease.  Refer to 2.7.4, Section 2.1.1.2 Adverse Events.   
SVII.1.2 
Risks Considered Important for Inclusion in the List of Safety Concerns in 
the RMP  
The following important identified risks, important potential risks, and missing information have 
been determined after a detailed analysis of the double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled 
pivotal Phase 3 study (Study 004), the pooled safety data across the patisiran-LNP studies in 
patients with hATTR amyloidosis (218 patients from completed Studies 003 and 004 and from  
an interim data cut [14 July 2017] of ongoing open-label extension Study 006 who received 
patisiran-LNP), and findings from the nonclinical studies. 
Important Identified Risks 
Infusion-related Reactions 
Infusion-related reactions (IRRs) have been observed in a higher proportion of patisiran-LNP-
treated patients compared with placebo-treated patients.  IRRs have been reported during IV 
administration of lipid-containing products,[Doessegger 2015; Salvador-Morales 2009] 
suggesting that one or more of the lipid excipients of patisiran-LNP could be responsible for 
these reactions. 
Risk-benefit impact: 
IRRs can be mitigated by treating patients with premedication (corticosteroid, antihistamines, 
and paracetamol) on the day of infusion; other suggested management practices include adjusting 
the rate of infusion.[Doessegger 2015; Szebeni 2014]  All patients receiving patisiran-LNP (as 
well as patients receiving placebo) received premedication regimens.  In the pooled dataset of 
218 patients treated with patisiran-LNP, IRRs were mild or moderate in severity and resolved.  
There were no severe IRRs or serious adverse events (SAEs).  The proportions of patients 
reporting IRRs and number of symptoms associated with IRRs decreased over time.  Among a 
total of 6954 doses given to the 218 patients; 25 doses were interrupted for 13 patients, with most 
interruptions coming early in treatment, and with only 2 incomplete doses given.  One patient 
discontinued treatment due to an IRR.  Given the significance of the disease and the benefit of 
patisiran-LNP treatment, the benefit of treatment outweighs the risk posed by IRRs that can be 
managed in clinical practice.   
IRRs observed in the patisiran-LNP clinical program are further characterized in Table 12. 
Important Potential Risks 
Consequences of Vitamin A Deficiency 
Because of the mechanism of action of patisiran-LNP, there is a theoretical risk of vitamin A 
deficiency.  Given the role of TTR as a carrier of RBP and thus vitamin A,[van Bennekum 2001] 
studies in monkeys with patisiran-LNP confirmed the secondary pharmacological effects 
associated with reductions in TTR, namely reductions, relative to baseline, in circulating RBP 
and vitamin A.  There were no sequelae due to the reductions of vitamin A in monkeys after 
chronic administration of patisiran-LNP.  In the clinical studies, reductions in circulating vitamin 
A have also been observed but without any manifestations of vitamin A deficiency.  Vitamin A 
transport and tissue uptake can occur in the absence of RBP.[Biesalski 1999; van Bennekum 
2001]  As a precaution, vitamin A supplementation at the usual daily recommended amount was 
advised in the clinical studies and will continue to be recommended to patients undergoing 
treatment with patisiran-LNP.   
Risk-benefit impact: 
The impact of this important potential risk on the risk-benefit balance of patisiran-LNP is 
expected to be negligible.  There is no safety concern relative to vitamin A deficiency in the 
clinical study data.  As a precaution, patients will be advised to take vitamin A supplementation 
of approximately 2500 IU per day. 
If a patient develops ocular symptoms suggestive of vitamin A deficiency (e.g., night blindness), 
referral to an ophthalmologist is recommended. 
Vitamin A levels that are too high or too low may be associated with an increased risk of foetal 
malformation. Information regarding recommended action for vitamin A supplementation and 
monitoring of vitamin A levels in the event of pregnancy, both planned and unplanned, are 
provided in the Product Information. 
Observations regarding vitamin A deficiency are described in Table 13. 
Severe Hypersensitivity 
Severe hypersensitivity reactions can occur due to a variety of immune mediated (eg, antibody 
mediated or T cell) and non-immune mediated (eg, pseudoallergy) responses that are often drug 
specific.[Dezsi 2014; Pichler 2007; Szebeni 2014]  
Risk-benefit impact: 
In the patisiran-LNP clinical studies, an increased risk of serious or severe hypersensitivity 
reactions has not been observed, and no specific risk factors have been identified.  However, as 
with all drugs, severe hypersensitivity reactions are possible.  Therefore, patisiran-LNP is 
contraindicated in patients with severe hypersensitivity (eg, anaphylaxis) to the active substance 
or any of the excipients.  Given a lack of observed serious and severe hypersensitivity in the 
patisiran-LNP clinical development program and the contraindication for patients with severe 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients, the impact of this important 
potential risk on the risk-benefit balance of patisiran-LNP is expected to be negligible. 
Observations related to severe hypersensitivity are described in Table 14. 
Hepatic Disorders 
In the nonclinical studies in rodents and monkey, patisiran-LNP revealed changes in serum liver 
markers and liver histopathology.  In the patisiran-LNP clinical studies, an increased risk of 
hepatic adverse events (AEs) has not been observed; the frequency of hepatic AEs has been low 
with no imbalances noted between the treatment groups in the placebo-controlled Study 004 and 
across the overall pooled experience.  In Study 004, a small increase (≤4.1 U/L) from baseline in 
mean absolute values of alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 
observed in the patisiran-LNP group compared with placebo that remained stable over the 18-
month treatment period.  The mean change from baseline in ALT and AST was not associated 
with mean changes from baseline in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) or total bilirubin.  Similar 
results were observed in Studies 003 and 006.  Across the 3 studies, ALT and AST have 
continued to remain stable over time for periods up to 49.5 months.  Given the significance of 
the disease and the benefit of patisiran-LNP treatment, the impact of this important potential risk 
on the benefit-risk balance of patisiran-LNP is expected to be negligible. 
Observations related to hepatic disorders are described in Table 15. 
Missing Information 
All missing information is summarized in Table 16. 
Longer-term Safety (>3 years) 
In clinical studies, patisiran-LNP has been administered to 218 patients with hATTR amyloidosis 
for periods up to 3.74 years.  There is limited information regarding the safety of patisiran-LNP 
for periods longer than 3 years.  Patisiran is indicated for the treatment of adults with hereditary 
transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR amyloidosis), a chronic disease with high morbidity 
and mortality.  As such, it is expected that patients would require long-term or perhaps life-long 
treatment for their disease.  
Risk-benefit impact: Although the side effects following chronic treatment with patisiran-LNP 
are unknown, based on the current clinical experience, additional safety concerns with long term 
treatment are not anticipated.  Patisiran-LNP is indicated to treat hATTR amyloidosis, a 
progressive and ultimately fatal disease.  Therefore, the impact of a lack of longer-term safety 
data on the risk-benefit balance, while unknown, is not expected to significantly affect the known 
safety profile of patisiran-LNP. 
Use in Patients with Moderate or Severe Hepatic Impairment 
Patients were excluded from patisiran-LNP studies if they had aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 
or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels >2.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN), total bilirubin 
(TBILI) >ULN (with a higher level allowed for Gilbert’s syndrome), and international 
normalized ratio ≤2.0 (≤3.5 allowed if on anticoagulant therapy).  In the pooled population 
(N=218), 13 patients (6.0%) had mild (TBILI=ULN and AST/ALT >ULN or TBILI >1.0×ULN 
to ≤1.5×ULN and any AST/ALT) and 2 patients (0.9%) had moderate (TBILI >1.5×ULN to 
≤3.0×ULN and any AST/ALT) hepatic impairment at baseline.  Therefore, data on patisiran-
LNP in patients with moderate hepatic impairment are limited, and patisiran-LNP has not been 
studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. 
Risk-benefit impact:  There have been no reports of Hy’s law cases (ALT or AST >3×ULN 
concurrent with TBILI >×2ULN).  The frequency of hepatic AEs was low and balanced between 
treatment groups, and no significant changes in liver function tests were reported in patients 
treated for up to 3.74 years.  Based on these results, there were no hepatic safety concerns in the 
population studied, and no specific monitoring of liver function tests beyond routine standard of 
care have been proposed.  Patisiran-LNP has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment, and in very few patients with moderate hepatic impairment.  The effect of this 
missing information on the risk-benefit balance for patients with moderate or severe hepatic 
impairment is unknown but is not expected to significantly affect the known safety profile of 
patisiran-LNP.   
Use in Patients with Severe Renal Impairment or End-stage Renal Disease 
In the pooled patient population (N=218), 68 patients (31.2%) had mild (estimated glomerular 
filtration rate [eGFR] ≥60 to <90 mL/min/1.73 m2) to moderate (eGFR ≥30 to 
<60 mL/min/1.73 m2) renal impairment, and only 1 patient had severe renal impairment.  
Therefore, the effect of patisiran-LNP on patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage 
renal disease (ESRD) has not been studied. 
Risk-benefit impact:  Patients with hATTR amyloidosis may have amyloid deposition in the 
kidney, and severe renal impairment that can progress to ESRD has been reported.[Lobato 2012]  
Clinical pharmacology data have shown that urinary excretion is a minor clearance pathway for 
patisiran and its components.  Therefore, exposure to patisiran-LNP is not expected to be greatly 
affected by reduced renal function.  Patients with mild or moderate renal impairment did not 
require dose adjustments.  The effect of this missing information on the risk-benefit balance for 
patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD, while unknown, is not expected to be 
significantly different from that for the overall population.   
Use in Patients with Prior Liver Transplant 
Patients who had undergone a liver transplant or who were planning to undergo this procedure 
were excluded from participation in patisiran-LNP clinical studies to avoid confounding the 
assessment of efficacy and safety.   
Risk-benefit impact: Patisiran-LNP targets the liver and has not been studied in patients after 
liver transplantation.  The effect of this missing information on the risk-benefit balance for 
patients with prior liver transplant is unknown, but is not expected to significantly affect the 
overall known safety profile of patisiran-LNP.   
Use in Pregnancy and Lactation 
In the clinical studies with patisiran-LNP, women of child-bearing potential were required to use 
contraception, and women who were pregnant or lactating were excluded from participation.  
Thus, there are no data on the safety of patisiran-LNP in this population.   
Risk-benefit impact:  While patisiran-LNP is expected to have low risk for reproductive and 
developmental toxicity based on available data from nonclinical studies, the effects of maternal 
serum TTR reduction or serum vitamin A reduction on a fetus are unknown.  Vitamin A levels 
that are too high or too low may be associated with foetal malformations.  The effect of possible 
risks of patisiran-LNP on the risk-benefit balance during pregnancy is unknown, and 
contraception is recommended for women of child-bearing potential. 
In lactating rats, while patisiran itself was not present in milk, small amounts of the lipid 
components were present.  Negligible transfer of patisiran-LNP to human milk is expected, and it 
would be digested upon consumption.  Therefore, the risk of systemic exposure in a 
breastfeeding child is likely to be low.  The impact of this missing information on the risk-
benefit balance of patisiran-LNP is unknown; however, consideration of the development and 
health benefits of breast-feeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need of 
patisiran-LNP.

Clinical safety data are summarized from the completed double-blind, randomized, placebo-
controlled pivotal Phase 3 study ALN-TTR02-004 (referred to as Study 004) and a pooled 
dataset (referred to as the pooled population) from Studies 003, 004, 006, 008, 011, and the 
patisiran arm of the vutrisiran study, ALN-TTRSC02-002.  The pooled population includes data 
from 636 patients who have received patisiran for up to 88.6 months (as of the final database 
lock for Study 006 of 07 December 2022 and the interim data cut for Study 011 of 
09 August 2023).

Presentation of Important Identified Risk and Important Potential Risks 
Details of the important identified risk are provided in Table 12.   
Details of the important potential risks are provided in Table 13 and Table 14. 
Table 12: 
Important Identified Risk: Infusion-related Reactions (IRRs) 
Potential mechanisms 
Evidence source(s) and 
strength of evidence 
Infusion-related reactions (IRRs) can occur during IV administration of 
lipid-containing products,[Doessegger 2015; Salvador-Morales 2009] 
suggesting that 1 or more of the lipid excipients of patisiran could be 
responsible for these reactions.  
Infusion-related reactions (IRRs) were reported in clinical studies of 
patisiran and included such signs and symptoms as back pain, flushing, 
nausea, and headache.  This group of symptoms was reported more 
frequently in patients receiving patisiran than in patients receiving 
placebo in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled pivotal 
Phase 3 clinical study.  IRRs were noted in other clinical studies of 
patisiran.  Patients received premedications (corticosteroid, 
antihistamines, and paracetamol) to reduce the risk of IRRs.  IRRs 
were mostly mild in severity and decreased in frequency over time.  
Few infusions had to be interrupted, and among those that were, most 
were resumed, and the full dose was administered. 
Characterization of the risk 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Study 004:  In the double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled 
pivotal Phase 3 study (N=225; 148 patisiran and 77 placebo), 18.9% of 
patients in the patisiran group and 9.1% of patients in the placebo 
group reported at least 1 IRR.   
In the patisiran group, signs and symptoms of IRRs reported in ≥2% of 
patients were back pain (6.1%), flushing (4.1%), nausea (3.4%), 
headache (2.7%), arthralgia and dyspnoea (2.0% each).  Flushing was 
reported in 7.8% of patients in the placebo group as well, indicating 
that this AE is most likely due to the premedication regimen or causes 
other than patisiran. 
None of the IRRs in the patisiran group were severe; all IRRs were 
mild or moderate in severity. None were reported as SAEs.  One 
patient reported an IRR that led to discontinuation of study treatment.  
All reported IRRs in the patisiran treatment group resolved without 
sequelae. 
Among patients in the patisiran treatment group who experienced 
IRRs, 78.6% of patients had their first IRR within the first 2 doses.  
There was little evidence that symptoms increased in frequency with 
repeated doses.  The overall proportion of patients reporting IRRs and 
number of symptoms associated with IRRs decreased over time. 
The number of infusion interruptions due to IRRs was low (17 
infusions in 8 patients in the patisiran group out of a total of 3740 
infusion interruptions in 148 patients).  Most patients with an 
interruption were able to receive a complete dose, with only 2 
incomplete doses due to IRRs.  
Pooled population:  The pattern of IRRs in the pooled patisiran 
population (N=636) is consistent with that seen in the placebo-
controlled studies.  IRRs were reported in 20.4% of patients and were 
mostly (14.0%) mild in severity, with 39 patients (6.1%) reporting 
moderate IRRs, and 2 patients (0.3%) reporting a severe IRR.  Among 
a total of 32,009 doses given to the 636 patients, 94 infusions were 
interrupted due to IRRs for 35 patients.  Most infusions (92.6%) that 
were interrupted were completed and the full dose was administered.  
A total of 4 (0.6%) patients in the Pooled Population discontinued 
treatment due to an IRR that was either mild or moderate in severity.  
As with the placebo-controlled study, the number of patients 
experiencing IRRs and the number of IRRs decreased over time.  Refer 
to 2.7.4, Section 2.7.1 Infusion-Related Reactions and 2.5, 
Section 5.7.1 Infusion-Related Reactions. 
In general, it is difficult to predict which patients in a population may 
be more susceptible to IRRs.  However, it is known that the IRRs may 
be prevented or the symptoms made less severe by the administration 
of premedication.[Doessegger 2015; Szebeni 2014]  Controlling how 
fast the drug is infused is also important to help decrease the number 
and severity of IRRs. 
Preventability 
Impact on the risk-benefit 
balance of the product 
Premedicating patients with a corticosteroid and/or antihistamines, or 
slowing of the infusion rate, are approaches that have been taken to 
reduce the incidence and/or severity of IRRs of lipid-containing 
drugs.[Doessegger 2015; Szebeni 2014]  The incidence and severity of 
patisiran can be prospectively mitigated via administration of 
premedications and also by adjusting the rate of infusion. 
Therefore, all patients should receive premedication prior to patisiran 
administration to reduce the risk of IRRs.  Premedications 
(corticosteroid, paracetamol, H1/H2 blockers) should be given on the 
day of patisiran infusion at least 60 minutes prior to the start of 
infusion. 
Patisiran should be infused intravenously over approximately 80 
minutes at an initial infusion rate of approximately 1 mL/min for the 
first 15 minutes, then increasing to approximately 3 mL/min for the 
remainder of infusion.  
If an IRR occurs, slowing or temporarily stopping the infusion should 
be considered.  Additional medical management (eg, corticosteroids or 
other symptomatic treatment) should be provided as medically 
indicated by the patient’s symptoms and status.  Some patients who 
experience IRRs may benefit from a slower infusion rate or additional 
or higher doses of 1 or more of the premedications with subsequent 
infusions to reduce the risk of IRRs. 
The IRRs observed with patisiran were manageable with 
premedications and infusion-rate adjustments.  There has been no 
evidence that IRRs worsen over time or with subsequent infusions.  
Given the significance of the disease and the benefit of patisiran 
treatment, the benefit of treatment outweighs the risk posed by IRRs. 
Public health impact 
The public health impact of IRRs due to patisiran is considered 
negligible.  
Table 13: 
Important Potential Risk: Consequences of Vitamin A Deficiency 
Potential mechanisms 
Because of the mechanism of action of patisiran, there is a theoretical 
risk of vitamin A deficiency.  Given the role of TTR as a carrier of 
RBP and thus vitamin A,[van Bennekum 2001] studies in monkeys 
with patisiran confirmed the secondary pharmacological effects 
associated with reductions in TTR, namely reductions, relative to 
baseline, in circulating RBP and vitamin A.  There were no sequelae 
due to the reductions of vitamin A in monkeys after chronic 
administration of patisiran.  In the clinical studies, reductions in 
circulating vitamin A have also been observed but without any 
manifestations of vitamin A deficiency.  Vitamin A transport and tissue 
uptake can occur in the absence of RBP.[Biesalski 1999; van 
Bennekum 2001] 
Evidence source(s) and 
strength of evidence 
Characterization of the risk 
The primary mechanism of action of patisiran is to reduce the level of 
TTR in the serum and reduction of amyloid deposits in the tissues.  
One function of TTR is to carry retinol binding protein (RBP), which 
distributes vitamin A in serum.  There is, therefore, a theoretical risk of 
vitamin A deficiency.  However, vitamin A can be distributed into 
tissues without RBP.[Biesalski 1999; van Bennekum 2001]  RBP and 
serum vitamin A were reduced in studies of patisiran in monkeys; 
however, no evidence of vitamin A deficiency was observed.  Patients 
in the clinical studies were advised to take vitamin A supplementation 
at the usual recommended daily amount.  No symptoms of vitamin A 
deficiency such as night blindness or other eye conditions were seen in 
patients receiving patisiran. 
In the placebo-controlled study (Study 004) at 18 months, a mean 
percent reduction from baseline of serum RBP of 45.3±22.4% (range 
7.3 to 78.6%) was observed in the patisiran group, compared with a 
mean reduction of 0.5±14.3% (range: 36.8 to 30.5%) in the placebo 
group.  The mean percent reductions of serum vitamin A at 18 months 
were 62.4±14.4% (range: 9 to 84%) in the patisiran group and 
0.1±15.7% (range:  53 to 29%) in the placebo group.  Refer to CSR 
Study 004 Table 14.2.3.6, Table 14.2.3.7. 
Patients experiencing selected ocular AEs:  Because ocular 
abnormalities are commonly observed in patients with vitamin A 
deficiency, particular attention was paid to the AEs in the Eye 
Disorders SOC.  Patients with hATTR amyloidosis also report eye 
disorders due to their underlying disease or consistent with their 
advanced age.[Conceicao 2016; Martins 2015]  In Study 004, 
treatment-emergent AEs in this SOC occurred in similar proportions of 
both treatment groups (27.7% in the patisiran group and 26.0% in the 
placebo group), with night blindness experienced by 1 (1.3%) patient 
in the placebo group.  In the pooled population of patients treated with 
patisiran (N=636), 199 (31.3%) patients experienced treatment-
emergent eye disorders, with night blindness reported in 3 (0.5%) 
patients.  None of the cases of reported night blindness were confirmed 
by the ophthalmological evaluation.  All cases reporting the preferred 
term of night blindness were nonserious, mild, reported limited 
information regarding the event and did not lead to change in dosing. 
Therefore, an analysis of AEs in the Eye Disorders SOC did not 
suggest an effect from vitamin A deficiency. 
Serial ophthalmology examinations performed in Study 004, including 
electroretinography, did not suggest changes related to vitamin A 
deficiency.  Overall, the examination findings remained stable 
throughout treatment. 
Refer to 2.7.4, Section 2.7.8 Ocular Events. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Prolonged dietary deficiency and other conditions such as 
gastrointestinal malabsorption due to a variety of causes can lead to 
vitamin A deficiency in the hATTR amyloidosis population.  
Preventability 
Impact on the risk-benefit 
balance of the product 
As transport and tissue uptake of vitamin A can occur through 
alternative mechanisms in the absence of RBP,[Biesalski 1999; 
Episkopou 1993; van Bennekum 2001] and because some patients may 
not get adequate vitamin A from their diet due to hATTR amyloidosis-
related gastrointestinal symptoms, supplementation at the 
recommended daily amount of vitamin A is recommended.  Laboratory 
tests for serum vitamin A do not reflect the total amount of vitamin A 
in the body during treatment with patisiran and should not be used to 
guide vitamin A supplementation. 
The impact of this important potential risk on the risk-benefit balance 
of patisiran is expected to be negligible.  There is no safety concern 
relative to vitamin A deficiency in the clinical study data.  As a 
precaution, patients are advised to take vitamin A supplementation at 
the usual recommended daily amount. 
If a patient develops ocular symptoms suggestive of vitamin A 
deficiency (e.g., night blindness), referral to an ophthalmologist is 
recommended. 
Public health impact 
The public health impact of vitamin A deficiency due to patisiran is 
considered negligible.  
Table 14: 
Important Potential Risk: Severe Hypersensitivity 
Potential mechanisms 
Severe hypersensitivity reactions can occur due to a variety of immune 
mediated (eg, antibody mediated) and non-immune mediated 
(eg, pseudoallergy) responses that are often drug specific.[Dezsi 2014; 
Pichler 2007; Szebeni 2014]  
Evidence source(s) and 
strength of evidence 
Severe hypersensitivity is a theoretical risk for any drug but has not 
been observed in patients taking patisiran. 
Characterization of the risk 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Preventability 
There were 10 (1.6%) patients with 12 severe events mapped to the 
Hypersensitivity SMQ (scope: narrow and broad) among patients in the 
pooled population (N=636).  Hypersensitivity AEs categorized as 
severe were acute respiratory failure (2 [0.3%] patients with 3 events), 
IRR (2 [0.3%] patients with 2 events), shock, respiratory arrest, 
generalised oedema, skin necrosis, dermatitis, respiratory failure, and 
circulatory collapse (1 [0.2%] patient each).  All were considered not 
related to patisiran, with the exception of the 2 IRRs. 
Patients with severe hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of 
the excipients are clearly at higher risk.  Patients with a personal 
history of atopy may be at higher risk in general; however, there are no 
specific data to suggest that these patients would be at higher risk of a 
reaction to patisiran. 
As with all drugs, severe hypersensitivity reactions are possible.  
Therefore, patisiran is contraindicated in patients with severe 
hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylaxis) to the active substance or any of the 
excipients, as described in the SmPC (Section 4.3). 
Impact on the risk-benefit 
balance of the product 
Public health impact 
In the patisiran clinical development program, no reports of severe 
hypersensitivity to patisiran have been observed.  Patisiran is 
administered by healthcare professionals, allowing for intervention if 
an immediate hypersensitivity reaction should occur.  Given a lack of 
observed hypersensitivity in the patisiran clinical development program 
and the contraindication for patients with severe hypersensitivity, the 
impact of this important potential risk on the risk-benefit balance of 
patisiran is expected to be negligible. 
Severe hypersensitivity reactions to patisiran have not been observed.  
Therefore, the public health impact is expected to be low.  
Table 15: 
Important Potential Risk: Hepatic Disorders 
Potential mechanisms 
Evidence sources and 
strength of evidence 
Characterization of the risk 
Patisiran is an siRNA that uses RNAi to inhibit the synthesis of wt and 
variant TTR protein in hepatocytes. Patisiran is formulated as lipid 
nanoparticles for delivery to the liver. 
Hepatoxicity was observed in the nonclinical studies in rat and monkey 
(see Table 3 for details). In Study 004, a small increase (≤4.1 U/L) 
from baseline in mean absolute values of ALT and AST was observed 
in the patisiran group compared to the placebo group that remained 
stable over the 18-month treatment period.  The mean change from 
baseline in ALT and AST was not associated with mean changes from 
baseline in ALP or TBILI.  Similar results were observed in Studies 
003 and 006. Across the 3 studies, ALT and AST levels remained 
stable over time for periods up to 84.9 months. 
Study 004:  In Study 004. the mean change from baseline in absolute 
values of ALT in the patisiran group ranged from 1.8 to 3.8 U/L and 
for AST ranged from 2.3 to 4.1 U/L across the visits over the 18-month 
duration of the study.  The majority of patients had ALT and AST 
values <ULN in Study 004.  Overall, 12 (15.6%) patients in the 
placebo group and 47 (31.8%) patients in the patisiran group had at 
least 1 ALT or AST value >ULN.  All of the elevations were ≤3×ULN, 
except for 1 (0.7%) patient in the patisiran group who had a transient 
elevation of ALT of 4.2×ULN on Day 84 without changes in AST, 
ALP, and TBILI.  There have been no patients with ALT or AST 
values >3×ULN with concurrent elevation of TBILI >2×ULN at any 
time in any of the studies.   
The proportion of patients with hepatic events mapping to the Drug 
related hepatic disorders - comprehensive search SMQ was 5.4% in the 
patisiran group and 9.1% in the placebo group.  Within the SMQ, the 
frequency of AEs in the Hepatobiliary disorders SOC (1.4% patisiran, 
1.3% placebo) and Investigations SOC (3.4% patisiran, 3.9% placebo) 
were similar across the 2 treatment groups.  Most of the hepatic AEs 
were mild or moderate in severity, and considered not related or 
unlikely related to study drug.  Hepatic AEs considered possibly 
related to study drug were hepatic enzyme increased and blood ALP 
increased in the patisiran group (1 patient [0.7%] each) and 
hypoalbuminemia in the placebo group (1 patient [1.3%]), all of which 
were mild in severity.  Hepatic SAEs were reported in 3 patients in the 
placebo group (LFTs abnormal, hypoalbuminemia, and liver transplant; 
1 patient each) and in 1 patient in the patisiran group (ascites).  All 
hepatic SAEs were considered unlikely or not related to study drug. 
Pooled population:  There were 66 (10.4%) patients with hepatic 
events mapped to the Drug related hepatic disorders - comprehensive 
search SMQ among patients in the pooled population (N=636).  Most 
hepatic events reported were laboratory elevations within the 
investigations SOC, which occurred in 6.1% of subjects.  A total of 7 
patients in the Pooled Population had hepatic events that were serious.  
One patient in Study 011 had a severe SAE of hepatic enzyme 
increased that was considered related to study drug.  Another patient in 
Study 011 had an AE of hepatic enzyme increased that led to 
discontinuation of study drug.  Hepatic events reported in ≥1% of 
patients were transaminases increased (1.7%), blood ALP increased 
(1.4%), ALT increased (1.3%), hepatic enzyme increased (1.3%), 
ascites (1.3%), and blood AST increased (1.1%); most AEs were mild 
or moderate in severity and not considered related to study treatment.  
In general, people with alcoholism, autoimmune diseases, bile duct 
disorders, exposure to hepatotoxins or hepatotoxic materials, hepatitis 
viruses, hereditary traits, obesity are considered to be risk factors for 
developing hepatic disorders. No risk factors have been identified in 
the clinical trials. 
Clinically significant changes in liver function tests or hepatic 
disorders attributable to patisiran have not been observed in clinical 
studies to date. 
Given the significance of the disease and the benefit of patisiran 
treatment, the benefit of treatment outweighs the risk posed by hepatic 
AEs; the impact of this important potential risk on the benefit-risk 
balance of patisiran is expected to be negligible. 
The public health impact is expected to be low.

Presentation of Missing Information 
The areas of missing information selected to be part of the list of safety concerns are presented in 
Table 16 .

Missing Information 
Details 
Longer-term safety 
(>3 years) 
Use in patients with 
moderate or severe 
hepatic impairment 
Use in patients with 
severe renal impairment 
or end-stage renal 
disease  
Evidence Source: 
In the pooled patient population, 580 patients have been exposed to 
patisiran for ≥12 months, 366 patients for ≥24 months, 195 patients for 
≥36 months, 167 patients for ≥48 months, 144 patients for ≥60 months, 
125 patients for ≥72 months, and 24 patients for ≥84 months (Table 5).  
Based on the available data, there are no known patisiran adverse drug 
reactions that have a long latency, are due to prolonged exposure, or are 
due to cumulative effects. 
Population in Need of Further Characterization: 
The recently completed open-label extension study (Study 006) gathered 
safety data in patients exposed up to 5 years to characterize the longer-term 
safety profile of patisiran. 
Evidence Source: 
Among the 636 patients who received patisiran in the pooled population, 
71 (11.2%) had mild, 14 (2.2%) had moderate, and 1 (0.2%) had severe 
hepatic impairment at baseline.  Therefore, data on patisiran in patients 
with moderate or severe hepatic impairment are limited.  There have been 
no Hy’s law cases (ALT or AST >3×ULN concurrent with TBILI 
>2×ULN) in clinical studies of patisiran.  The frequency of hepatic AEs
was low and balanced between treatment groups, and no clinically
significant changes in liver function tests were reported in patients.  Refer
to 2.5, Section 5.7.4 Hepatic Events and to Table 15.
Anticipated risk/consequence of the missing information: 
There have been no hepatic safety concerns in the population studied, and 
no specific monitoring of liver function tests beyond routine standard of 
care have been proposed.  Patisiran has been studied in very few patients 
with moderate or severe hepatic impairment; the risk of its use in these 
patients is unknown.   
Evidence Source: 
Clinical pharmacology data have shown that urinary excretion is a minor 
clearance pathway for the siRNA (ALN-18328) and the lipid 
DLin-MC3-DMA components of patisiran.  In the pooled population of 
patients treated with patisiran (N=636), 219 (34.4%) patients had mild 
renal impairment, 171 (26.9%) patients had moderate renal impairment, 
and 8 (1.3%) patients had severe renal impairment at baseline.  No 
increased risk was associated with administration of patisiran to patients 
with renal impairment, and no dose adjustments were necessary.   
Anticipated risk/consequence of the missing information: 
There have been no renal safety concerns in the patisiran clinical studies.  
Patisiran has been studied in very few patients with severe renal 
impairment or end-stage renal disease; therefore, the risk of its use in these 
patients is unknown.   
Missing Information 
Details 
Use in patients with 
prior liver 
transplantation 
Use in pregnancy and 
lactation 
Evidence Source: 
Patients who had previously undergone a liver transplant for treatment of 
hATTR amyloidosis or who were planning to undergo this procedure were 
excluded from participation in the patisiran clinical studies, with the 
exception of the completed Study ALN-TTR02-008, which was a Phase 3b, 
open-label study to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of 
patisiran in patients with hATTR amyloidosis with disease progression 
post-OLT.  In Study 008, a total of 23 patients received at least 1 dose of 
patisiran, 22 of whom completed the study, with 1 patient having 
discontinued the study after receiving 1 dose of patisiran, due to patient 
decision. 
Population in Need of Further Characterization: 
The final data from Study 008 indicate that patisiran has an acceptable 
safety profile in the treatment of hATTR amyloidosis with disease 
progression post-OLT, and results were consistent with the established 
safety profile of patisiran in patients with hATTR amyloidosis and 
polyneuropathy without a history of OLT.  However, the data on the use of 
patisiran in this patient population are limited and therefore the risk of the 
use of patisiran in this patient population requires further characterization.   
Evidence Source: 
In the clinical studies with patisiran, women of child-bearing potential were 
required to use contraception, and women who were pregnant or lactating 
were excluded from participation.  Thus, there are no data on the safety of 
patisiran in this population.   
In nonclinical studies, patisiran had no adverse effects on male or female 
fertility, pregnancy, or embryo-fetal development at doses that did not 
result in maternal toxicity.  While patisiran is expected to have low risk for 
reproductive and developmental toxicity based on available data from 
nonclinical studies, the effects of maternal serum TTR reduction or serum 
vitamin A reduction on a fetus are unknown. Vitamin A levels that are too 
high or too low may be associated with an increased risk of fetal 
malformation.  In lactating rats, while patisiran itself was not present in 
milk, small amounts of the lipid components were present. 
Anticipated risk/consequence of the missing information: 
The risk to pregnancy outcomes and to the fetus and infant are unknown.  
Patisiran is not recommended for use in pregnancy and contraception is 
recommended for women of child-bearing potential. It is unknown whether 
patisiran is excreted in human milk.

PART III.  PHARMACOVIGILANCE PLAN (INCLUDING POST-
AUTHORIZATION SAFETY STUDIES) 
III.1
Routine Pharmacovigilance Activities 
Routine pharmacovigilance, including AE collection and reporting, signal detection, and signal 
evaluation will be conducted as described in the Pharmacovigilance System Master File. Specific 
targeted follow-up of questionnaires for IRRs and severe hypersensitivity will be analyzed and 
presented in the periodic safety update reports (PSURs) to inform further risk management 
(see Annex 4).  Reports of exposure during pregnancy will be routinely collected, reported, and 
followed up for pregnancy and infant outcomes. 
III.2
Additional Pharmacovigilance Activities 
Additional Pharmacovigilance activities include an ongoing global pregnancy surveillance 
program Study 010, and a planned prospective observational cohort Study 009: 
• ALN-TTR02-010 (Study 010) is a global pregnancy surveillance program being
conducted as part of an FDA postmarketing requirement to collect and evaluate
information on exposure during pregnancy and infant outcomes in hATTR
amyloidosis patients exposed to patisiran.  As of the data lock point of this risk
management plan (RMP), no patients have enrolled in Study ALN-TTR02-010 (see
Table 19).
• Study ALN-TTR02-009 (Study 009) is a non-interventional observational cohort
study that is being conducted over a period of 10 years and will provide real-world
safety experience from patisiran use, as well as provide comparative safety data from
other treatments, or no treatment, that can be used to further assess the findings and
any association with patisiran.  The study cohort will include all patients with hATTR
amyloidosis under care at the participating clinics, as no exclusion criteria are
intended with this observational cohort.  Patients treated at home, as well as patients
with hepatic or renal impairment, and patients with prior liver transplantation will be
observed as part of the cohort.  The planned size of the total hATTR amyloidosis
study cohort is 300 patients and will include 150 patients exposed to patisiran over a
period of up to 10 years from the time the first patient is treated with patisiran post-
authorization. The study is targeting to evaluate at least 900 patient-years of patient
experience on patisiran.
Studies 010, and 009 are described in Table 18.  Annex 2 provides additional details for the 
completed Study 006, and Ongoing Studies 010, and 009, and Annex 3 provides a copy of the 
Study 010, and Study 009 protocols.

PART IV.  PLANS FOR POST-AUTHORIZATION EFFICACY STUDIES 
No post-authorization efficacy studies have been imposed for patisiran that are conditions of the 
marketing authorization or that are specific obligations. 
PART V.  RISK MINIMIZATION MEASURES 
Routine Risk Minimization Measures 
V.1 
Careful consideration of the benefit-risk balance for patisiran leads to the conclusion that routine 
risk minimization activities are sufficient to manage the majority of the safety concerns 
associated with patisiran.  Routine risk communication through product labeling describes the 
safety profile for the product and communicates to healthcare professionals the appropriate 
actions to prevent or mitigate risks, where those recommendations exist.  In addition to the 
routine risk minimization measures, Educational Materials will be provided to health care 
professionals and patients to support the home administration of patisiran (Section V.2).   
Routine pharmacovigilance activities as summarized in Section III.1 , and if through routine 
pharmacovigilance new risks are identified, the risk communication and minimization measures 
will be updated as necessary. 
An overview of the proposed risk minimization activities for the important identified risk, 
important potential risks, and missing information for patisiran are provided in Table 20. 
Table 20: 
Risk Minimization Measures by Safety Concern 
Safety Concern 
Risk Minimization Activities 
Important identified 
risk:   
Infusion-related 
reactions (IRRs) 
Routine risk communication: 
• Description of the proportion of patients with, frequency, nature and
severity of IRRs is provided in Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 of the
SmPC
• Description of IRRs is provided in Section 2 and Section 4 of the
Package Leaflet
Routine risk minimization activities recommending specific clinical measures 
to address the risk: 
• Onpattro therapy should be initiated under the supervision of a
physician knowledgeable in the management of amyloidosis
(Section 4.2 of the SmPC)
•
•
Premedication is required, and recommended medications, dosages,
and timing are described in Section 4.2 of the SmPC and Section 3 of
the Package Leaflet
Instructions on the recommended rate of infusion are provided in
Section 4.2 of the SmPC
• Recommendations for medical management of an IRR, if it occurs,
including interruption or slowing of the Onpattro infusion rate and/or
instituting medical management as clinically indicated (Section 4.4 of
the SmPC)
•
•
Information that some patients who experience IRRs may benefit
from a slower infusion rate or additional or higher doses of one or
more of the premedications with subsequent infusions to reduce the
risk of IRRs (Section 4.4 of the SmPC)
Instructions that the decision for whether a patient can receive
infusions at home should be made by the treating physician and may
Safety Concern 
Risk Minimization Activities 
Important potential 
risk:  
Consequences of 
vitamin A deficiency 
be considered for patients who have tolerated at least 3 infusions well 
in the clinic (Section 4.2 of the SmPC).  Home infusion should be 
performed by a healthcare professional 
Other routine risk minimization measures beyond the Product Information: 
• Legal status:  restricted medical prescription
Additional risk minimization measures: 
• Educational Materials for HCPs and patients to ensure the safe and
sustainable administration of Onpattro in the home
Routine risk communication: 
• The secondary pharmacologic effect of Onpattro on serum vitamin A
levels is described in Section 4.4, Section 4.5, Section 4.6, and
Section 5.1 of the SmPC, and in Section 2 of the Package Leaflet
Routine risk minimization activities recommending specific clinical measures 
to address the risk: 
• Recommendation that serum vitamin A levels below lower limit of
normal should be corrected and any ocular symptoms due to vitamin
A deficiency be evaluated prior to initiation of treatment (Section 4.4
of the SmPC and Section 2 of the Package Leaflet)
• Recommendation for vitamin A supplementation of approximately
2500 IU per day (Section 4.2 and Section 4.4 of the SmPC and
guidance for patients in Section 2 of the Package Leaflet)
• Recommendation not to use serum vitamin A levels to guide vitamin
A supplementation (Section 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC)
•
If a patient develops ocular symptoms suggestive of vitamin A
deficiency (e.g., night blindness), referral to an ophthalmologist is
recommended (Section 4.4 of the SmPC) and patients are advised to
talk to their doctor if they notice symptoms suggestive of vitamin A
deficiency (Section 2 of the Package Leaflet)
• A statement that vitamin A levels that are too high or too low may be
associated with an increased risk of foetal malformation has been
added in Section 4.4 and 4.6 of the SmPC and Section 2 of the
Package Leaflet, and recommendation that pregnancy should be

PART VI.  SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR 
ONPATTRO (PATISIRAN) 
This is a summary of the RMP for Onpattro.  The RMP details important risks of Onpattro, how 
these risks can be minimized, and how more information will be obtained about Onpattro’s risks 
and uncertainties (missing information). 
Onpattro’s Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and its Package Leaflet (PL) give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Onpattro should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Onpattro should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Onpattro’s 
RMP. 
I.
The medicine and what it is used for
Onpattro is authorized for the treatment of hATTR amyloidosis in adult patients with stage 1 or 
stage 2 polyneuropathy.  It contains patisiran as the active substance and it is given by 
intravenous infusion. 
Further information about the evaluation of Onpattro’s benefits can be found in Onpattro’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the 
medicine’s webpage https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/onpattro. 
II.
Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimize or
further characterize the risks
Important risks of Onpattro, together with measures to minimize such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Onpattro’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
• Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the
Package Leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;
•
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
• The authorized pack size - the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure
that the medicine is used correctly;
• The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with
or without prescription) can help to minimize its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In the case of Onpattro, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimization 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analyzed, including PSUR assessment, so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary.  These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Onpattro is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’. 
II.A
List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Onpattro are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered.  
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential.  Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Onpattro.  Potential risks are concerns for which 
an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation.  Missing information refers 
to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine);

Summary of important risks 
Important Identified Risk:  Infusion-Related Reactions (IRRs) 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Infusion-related reactions (IRRs) were reported in clinical studies of 
Onpattro and included such signs and symptoms as back pain, flushing, 
nausea, and headache.  This group of symptoms was reported more 
frequently in patients receiving Onpattro than in patients receiving 
placebo in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled pivotal Phase 3 
clinical study.  IRRs were noted in other clinical studies of Onpattro.  
Patients received premedications (corticosteroid, antihistamines, and 
paracetamol) to reduce the risk of IRRs.  IRRs were mostly mild in 
severity and decreased in frequency over time.  Few infusions had to be 
interrupted, and among those that were, most continued until the full dose 
was administered. 
In general, it is difficult to predict which patients in a population may be 
more susceptible to IRRs.  However, it is known that IRRs may be 
prevented or the symptoms made less severe by the administration of

Important Potential Risk:  Consequences of Vitamin A Deficiency 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
The primary mechanism of action of Onpattro is to reduce the level of 
TTR.  One function of TTR is to carry retinol binding protein, which 
distributes vitamin A in serum.  There is, therefore, a theoretical risk of 
vitamin A deficiency.  However, vitamin A can distribute into tissues by 
TTR-independent mechanisms.  Retinol binding protein and serum 
Important Potential Risk:  Consequences of Vitamin A Deficiency 
vitamin A were reduced in studies of Onpattro in monkeys; however, no 
evidence of vitamin A deficiency was observed.  Patients in the clinical 
studies were advised to take vitamin A supplementation at the usual 
recommended daily dose.  No symptoms of vitamin A deficiency such as 
night blindness or other eye conditions were seen in patients receiving 
Onpattro. 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Prolonged dietary deficiency and other conditions such as gastrointestinal 
malabsorption due to a variety of causes can lead to vitamin A deficiency 
in the hATTR amyloidosis population.

Important Potential Risk:  Severe Hypersensitivity 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Severe hypersensitivity is a theoretical risk for any drug, but has not been 
observed in patients taking Onpattro. 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Risk minimization 
measures 
Patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity to patisiran or any of the 
excipients are clearly at higher risk.  Patients with a personal history of 
atopy may be at higher risk in general; however, there are no specific data 
to suggest that these patients would be at higher risk of a reaction to 
Onpattro. 
Routine risk minimization measures: 
• Statement that Onpattro is contraindicated in patients with severe
hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylaxis) to the active substance or any of the
excipients in Section 4.3 of the SmPC and Section 2 of the Package

Hepatoxicity was observed in the nonclinical studies in rodents and 
monkey. In the placebo-controlled Phase 3 study, there was no increase in 
hepatic AEs in patients treated with patisiran compared to patients treated 
with placebo.  A small increase of ALT and AST from baseline was 
observed in the patisiran group compared with placebo that remained 
stable for the 18-month treatment period.  The changes in ALT and AST 
were not associated with changes in ALP or TBILI.  Similar results were 
observed in the open-label extension studies. Across the 3 studies, ALT 
and AST levels remained stable over time for periods up to 84.9 months. 
Patients with hepatic impairment or liver transplants may be at higher risk 
for hepatic disorders.

measures 
Routine risk minimization measures: 
• Information on the absence of clinical data in pregnant and lactating
women is included in Section 4.6 of the SmPC, with a cross-reference
to nonclinical data on embryo-fetal development, lactation, and fertility
in Section 5.3 of the SmPC
• Recommendation for use of effective contraception in women of
childbearing potential is provided in Section 4.4 and Section 4.6 of the
SmPC and Section 2 of the Package Leaflet

Study ALN-TTR02-009, Prospective Observational Cohort Study 
This non-interventional observational cohort study will provide real-world experience from 
patisiran use, as well as provide comparative safety data from other treatments, or no treatment, 
that can be used to further assess the findings and any association with patisiran.  The study 
cohort will include all patients with hATTR amyloidosis under care at the participating clinics, 
as no exclusion criteria are intended with this observational cohort.  Patients treated at home, as 
well as patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and patients with prior liver transplantation 
will be observed as part of the cohort.  The planned size of the total hATTR amyloidosis study 
cohort is 300 patients and will include 150 patients exposed to patisiran over a period of up to 
10 years from the time the first patient is treated with patisiran post-authorization. The study is 
targeting to evaluate at least 900 patient-years of patient experience on patisiran. 
Study ALN-TTR02-010, Global Pregnancy Surveillance Program 
This global pregnancy surveillance program will collect and evaluate information on exposure 
during pregnancy and infant outcomes in patients with hATTR amyloidosis who are exposed to 
patisiran.  As of the data lock point of this RMP, no patients have enrolled in 
Study ALN-TTR02-010.

Annex 6 
Details of Proposed Additional Risk Minimization Activities 
Educational Materials for healthcare providers and patients to ensure the safe and sustainable 
administration of patisiran in the home in the post-marketing setting will be submitted to the 
national competent authorities.  The Educational Materials are intended to supplement the 
information provided in the SmPC and the Package Leaflet and will convey the important key 
concepts outlined below. 
The Educational Materials for HCPs should include information about: 
• Suitability of the patient for home infusion;
• Requirements for home infusion, including availability and timely administration of the
appropriate premedication;
• The appropriate infusion rate;
• Signs and symptoms of IRRs;
• Action to take in the event of an IRR and in case of emergency;
• Steps to consider to prevent further IRRs;
• Reasons triggering HCPs to consider whether the patient should stop home infusions and
return to the clinic to have their infusions.
The Educational Materials for patients (a home infusion guide detailing the steps to undertake 
during home infusion) should include information about: 
• How the infusion is given;
• The potential for IRRs to occur;
• Signs and symptoms of IRRs;
• Patients to inform immediately the HCP if they experience any of the signs and symptoms of
IRRs.

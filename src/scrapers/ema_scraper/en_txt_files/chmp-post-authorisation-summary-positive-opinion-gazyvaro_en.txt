On 28 April 2016, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion 
recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Gazyvaro. 
The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Roche Registration Limited. 
The CHMP adopted a new indication as follows:  
“Follicular Lymphoma (FL)  
Gazyvaro in combination with bendamustine followed by Gazyvaro maintenance is indicated for the 
treatment of patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) who did not respond or who progressed during 
or up to 6 months after treatment with rituximab or a rituximab-containing regimen.” 
For information, the full indications for Gazyvaro will be as follows2: 
“Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL) 
Gazyvaro in combination with chlorambucil is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and with comorbidities making them 
unsuitable for full-dose fludarabine based therapy (see section 5.1).

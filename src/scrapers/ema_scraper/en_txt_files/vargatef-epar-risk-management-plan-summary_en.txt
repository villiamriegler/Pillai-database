SUMMARY OF RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR VARGATEF (NINTEDANIB)
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Vargatef. The RMP details 
important risks of Vargatef, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information 
will be obtained about Vargatef's risks and uncertainties (missing information).
Vargatef's Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Vargatef should be used.
This summary of the RMP for Vargatef should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which 
is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Vargatef's RMP.
I.
THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Vargatef is authorised in combination with docetaxel for the treatment of adult patients with 
locally advanced, metastatic or locally recurrent NSCLC of adenocarcinoma tumour 
histology after first line chemotherapy (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains 
nintedanib as the active substance and it is given orally.
Further information about the evaluation of Vargatef’s benefits can be found in Vargatef’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the 
medicine’s webpage https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/vargatef.

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND ACTIVITIES TO 
MINIMISE OR FURTHER CHARACTERISE THE RISKS
Important risks of Vargatef, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Vargatef's risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
-
-
-
-
Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in 
the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly;
The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. 
with or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.
If important information that may affect the safe use of Vargatef is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below.
II.A
List of important risks and missing information
Important risks of Vargatef are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Vargatef. Potential risks are concerns 
for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but 
this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing 
information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently 
missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

Summary of important risks
Diarrhoea
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine
Risk factors and risk groups
Risk minimisation measures
In the main (pivotal) clinical trial of Vargatef 
(trial 1199.13), diarrhoea was more frequent in 
patients treated with nintedanib in combination 
with docetaxel as compared to patients treated with 
docetaxel alone. In the post-marketing setting, 
diarrhoea is among the most frequently reported 
events. Diarrhoea was non-serious in more than 
85% of the reported cases. Serious cases of 
diarrhoea leading to dehydration and electrolyte 
disturbances have been reported with nintedanib. 
Cases of renal impairment / failure, in some cases 
with fatal outcome, have been reported with 
nintedanib use.
Possible causes and risk factors for diarrhoea in 
cancer patients include the type and location of the 
cancer, surgery, chemotherapy, effects of other 
drugs, radiotherapy, diet, infection, and 
comorbidities. Diarrhoea is a known adverse effect 
of docetaxel.

Risk factors and risk groups
Risk minimisation measures
In the pivotal clinical trial of Vargatef (trial 
1199.13), elevations of liver enzymes and total 
bilirubin were more frequent in patients treated 
with nintedanib in combination with docetaxel as 
compared to patients treated with docetaxel alone. 
Furthermore, liver enzyme elevations are among 
the most frequently reported events in the post-
marketing setting. Cases of DILI have been 
observed with nintedanib treatment. In the post-
marketing period, severe liver injury with fatal 
outcome has been reported in a patient with IPF 
after treatment with Ofev (nintedanib approved in 
the indication of IPF).
Population pharmacokinetics analyses in patients 
with NSCLC and IPF revealed that female and 
Asian patients have a higher risk of elevations in 
liver enzymes upon nintedanib treatment. 
Nintedanib exposure increased linearly with 
patients’ age and was inversely correlated to 
weight. The increased nintedanib exposure may 
result in a higher risk of developing liver enzyme 
elevations.

Labelling in SmPC Sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, and 4.9.
Prescription only medicine. Treatment with

Neutropenia
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine
Risk factors and risk groups
Risk minimisation measures
In the pivotal clinical trial of Vargatef (trial 
1199.13), neutropenia AEs of CTC AE grade ≥3 
(moderate to severe intensity) and decreased 
neutrophil count grade ≥3 measured as laboratory 
value were slightly more frequent in patients 
treated with nintedanib in combination with 
docetaxel as compared to patients treated with 
docetaxel alone.
Docetaxel (which is used in combination with 
nintedanib for treatment of NSCLC) has 
myelosuppressive effects, and is associated with 
neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and infection. 
In a review of cancer patients, commonly identified 
risk factors for neutropenia or febrile neutropenia, 
other than the chemotherapy type, generally 
included advanced age, low performance status
(decreased general condition), high serum lactate 
dehydrogenase level, low pre-treatment leukocyte 
count, low serum albumin, and severe neutropenia 
or decreased haemoglobin level during a previous 
chemotherapy cycle (in the absence of subsequent 
chemotherapy dose reduction or use of myeloid 
growth factors to mitigate the risk).
All grade and severe grade neutropenia due to 
docetaxel is increased in Asian patients compared 
to white/Caucasian patients.
Routine risk minimisation measures:
Labelling in SmPC Sections 4.2, 4.4, and 4.8.

Sepsis

Risk minimisation measures
In the pivotal clinical trial of Vargatef (trial 
1199.13), sepsis was more frequent in patients 
treated with nintedanib in combination with 
docetaxel compared to patients treated with 
docetaxel alone. Cases of sepsis have also been 
reported in the post-marketing setting.
Factors that can predispose lung cancer patients to 
infection include neutropenia, chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease, obstructive lesions, advanced 
age, and altered immune function. Because 
neutropenia is a common adverse drug reaction for 
many chemotherapeutic agents and neutropenia is a 
major risk factor for sepsis, the chemotherapy 
regimen administered (specific drugs, doses, and 
schedule) is an important determinant of sepsis risk 
among patients with cancer.
Older age and male gender have also been reported 
as risk factors for sepsis among lung cancer 
patients.

therapies.
Additional risk minimisation measures:
None
VTE
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine
Risk factors and risk groups
Risk minimisation measures
The medical concept of VTE includes venous 
thrombotic events and pulmonary embolism. In the 
pivotal clinical trial of Vargatef (trial 1199.13), 
venous thromboembolic events were more frequent 
in patients treated with nintedanib in combination 
with docetaxel as compared to patients treated with 
docetaxel alone. Venous thromboembolic events 
have also been reported in the post-marketing 
setting.
Reasons leading to the development of VTE in 
cancer patients are frequently categorised as 
cancer-related (with rates highest in lung cancer 
patients, patients with any cancer of the 
adenocarcinoma subtype, and patients with 
advanced stage disease), treatment-related (with 
higher rates seen with the use of chemotherapy, 
antiangiogenic medications, and erythropoiesis-
stimulating agents), and patient-related (with high 
rates among the obese, those with prolonged 
immobility, and those with a history of VTE). The 
risk of VTE varies over time after a diagnosis of 
cancer. The risk is highest early after diagnosis, 
and there is a strong correlation between 
metastatic-stage cancer and risk of VTE. 
Hospitalised patients, patients undergoing surgery, 
and patients receiving chemotherapy are at 
particularly high risk for VTE.
Routine risk minimisation measures:
Labelling in SmPC Sections 4.2, 4.4, and 4.8.
Prescription only medicine. Treatment with 
Vargatef should be initiated and supervised by a

Additional risk minimisation measures:
None
Perforation (GI and non-GI)
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine
Risk factors and risk groups
Risk minimisation measures
Perforation is a rare event. In the pivotal clinical 
trial of Vargatef (trial 1199.13), the frequency of 
GI perforation events was balanced between the 
treatment arms. Cases of GI perforation, some of 
which were fatal, have been reported infrequently 
in the pivotal clinical trial of Vargatef and in the 
post-marketing setting.
The medical concept of non-GI perforation 
includes perforations, fistulae, and abscesses 
outside the GI tract. In the pivotal clinical trial of 
Vargatef (trial 1199.13), AEs in the medical 
concept of ‘non-GI perforation’ were more 
frequent in patients treated with nintedanib in 
combination with docetaxel as compared to 
patients treated with docetaxel alone. The majority 
of AEs were abscesses with a preferred location in 
the lung or the chest, and mainly of CTC AE grade 
1 and 2 (mild intensity). 
Risk factors for perforation include cancer-related 
conditions (e.g. abdominal carcinomatosis), other 
underlying diseases (peptic ulcer disease, 
diverticulitis, bowel obstruction), chemotherapy-
induced colitis, abdominal irradiation, history of 
bowel surgery, and drugs (steroids, non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs).

Bleeding

Risk minimisation measures
In the pivotal clinical trial of Vargatef (trial 
1199.13), bleeding was slightly more frequent in 
patients treated with nintedanib in combination 
with docetaxel as compared to patients treated with 
docetaxel alone. The imbalance in the overall 
population was driven by patients with squamous 
NSCLC. In patients with adenocarcinoma, the 
frequency of bleeding in both treatment arms was 
comparable. Serious and non-serious bleeding
events, some of which were fatal, have been 
reported in the pivotal clinical trial of Vargatef and 
in the post-marketing setting. Post-marketing 
bleeding events include, but are not limited to, GI, 
respiratory and central nervous system organs, with 
the most frequent being respiratory.
Common risk factors for bleeding include inherited 
predisposition to bleeding, advanced age, 
hypertension, invasive procedures, injuries, and use 
of anticoagulants. The risk of bleeding in advanced 
NSCLC patients appears to depend on the tumour 
histology; studies in advanced NSCLC have 
suggested that patients with squamous cell 
carcinoma and large cell carcinoma have a higher 
risk of bleeding than patients with adenocarcinoma 
or non-squamous cell carcinoma. Epidemiological 
studies suggest that patients with tumour 
cavitation, prophylactic anticoagulation therapy, 
and age >65 years with CNS metastases may also 
be at increased risk of bleeding events.

In the pivotal clinical trial of Vargatef (trial 
1199.13), hypertension was more frequent in 
patients treated with nintedanib in combination 
with docetaxel as compared to patients treated with 
docetaxel alone. Hypertension has been reported in 
the post-marketing setting. In the vast majority of 
cases, the reported events of hypertension are non-
serious.
Common risk factors for hypertension are smoking 
(history of), overweight/obesity, not being 
physically active, stress, metabolic disorders 
(dyslipidaemia, diabetes mellitus), advanced age, 
male gender, and race (Black).

Myocardial infarction
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine
Risk factors and risk groups
Risk minimisation measures
In the pivotal clinical trial of Vargatef (trial 
1199.13), AEs reflecting MI were infrequently 
reported and slightly less frequent in the Vargatef 
arm compared to the placebo arm. In the post-
marketing setting, cases of MI have been 
infrequently reported, some of the cases being in 
patients with risk factors.
Patients who have experienced ATE, including MI, 
are at an increased risk to experience further 
thromboembolic events. Chemotherapy itself is 
considered to be one of the most important risk 
factors for venous and arterial thromboembolic 
events in the cancer setting. Cancer patients on 
chemotherapy presenting predisposing factors in 
their medical history (such as smoking history, 
obesity, diabetes, and previous cardiovascular 
disease) are at a higher risk to experience ATE, 
including MI.

Risk minimisation measures
In the pivotal clinical trial of Vargatef (trial 
1199.13), in NSCLC the frequency of ATE was 
comparable between the 2 treatment arms. 
However, in the pivotal clinical trials in IPF, an 
increased frequency of ATE was observed in 
patients treated with nintedanib monotherapy as 
compared to patients treated with placebo. 
Different medical history and risk factors of the 
IPF patient population need to be taken into 
consideration. 
In the post-marketing setting in NSCLC, a low 
number of ATE cases has been reported, mainly in 
patients with risk factors.
Patients who have experienced ATE (including MI
and coronary artery disease) are at an increased risk 
of experiencing further thromboembolic events. 
Chemotherapy itself is considered to be one of the 
most important risk factors for venous and arterial 
thromboembolic events in the cancer setting. 
Cancer patients on chemotherapy presenting 
predisposing factors (such as smoking history, 
obesity, diabetes, and previous cardiovascular 
disease) in their medical history are at higher risk 
of experiencing ATE.

Risk factors and risk groups
Risk minimisation measures
Angiogenesis is critical to foetal development. 
Following administration of nintedanib to rats, the 
inhibition of angiogenesis resulted in absorption of 
foetuses and increased incidence of malformations. 
These effects occurred at dose levels resulting in 
plasma drug concentrations comparable to, or 
lower than, those reached in humans during 
treatment with Vargatef.
Women of childbearing potential are at risk to 
become pregnant, if they do not use effective 
contraception or failure of contraception occurs.

Hepatic failure
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine
‘Liver enzyme elevations and hyperbilirubinaemia 
including DILI’ is an important identified risk of 
Vargatef. DILI can be severe and can lead to 
hepatic failure.
In the pivotal clinical trial of Vargatef (trial 
1199.13), the majority of the AEs included in the 
medical concept of ‘hepatic failure’ (including 
precursors and symptoms), were liver enzyme 
elevations which were reversible in the majority of 
cases. In the post-marketing setting, reported 
events comprised liver enzyme elevations and/or 
hepatic events as a consequence of the underlying 
malignancy. None of the reported events met the 
medical definition of hepatic failure.

Cardiac failure
Evidence for linking the risk to the

Risk factors and risk groups
Risk minimisation measures
Some approved VEGF inhibitors (bevacizumab, 
sorafenib, sunitinib, and pazopanib) are associated 
with undesirable effects such as cardiac failure, 
congestive cardiac failure, or decrease in left 
ventricular ejection fraction. The range of kinases 
inhibited by TKIs is variable. It is currently not 
possible to define a specific class of typical TKIs 
that may be considered to have a higher risk of 
inducing cardiovascular events.
Main risk factors for cardiac failure are increasing 
age, family history, hypertension, and coronary 
artery disease, including a history of MI. Other risk 
factors are diabetes mellitus, obesity, metabolic 
syndrome, and other cardiac disorders (e.g. 
arrhythmia, cardiac valve disorder). Additional risk 
factors in cancer patients are previous cardiotoxic 
anticancer therapies.

QT prolongation
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine
Risk factors and risk groups
Risk minimisation measures
QT prolongation and/or torsades de pointes have 
been reported with some VEGF inhibitors (e.g. 
sunitinib, vandetanib, sorafenib, and pazopanib). 
Nintedanib did neither show inhibition of the 
hERG channel nor unequivocally drug-related 
effects on heart rate, QT interval, or any other ECG 
parameter in vivo at relevant human therapeutic 
plasma concentrations.
In a dedicated clinical trial of nintedanib 
monotherapy in patients with renal cell carcinoma, 
single oral doses, as well as multiple oral doses, of 
200 mg nintedanib administered twice daily for 
15 days did not prolong the QTcF interval.
In the pivotal clinical trial of Vargatef (trial 
1199.13) and in the post-marketing setting, no AEs 
indicating QT prolongation have been reported. 
Risk factors for QT prolongation are female 
gender, low serum potassium, low serum 
magnesium, bradycardia, left ventricular 
hypertrophy, congestive heart failure, recent 
conversion from atrial fibrillation, a family history 
of long QT syndrome, and use of QT prolonging 
drugs.

Risk minimisation measures
There is no information on the excretion of 
Vargatef and its metabolites in human breast milk. 
Data from non-clinical studies showed that only 
small amounts (<0.5% of the administered dose of 
the mother substance and its metabolites) were 
secreted into the milk of lactating rats. No 
administration of Vargatef during breastfeeding has 
been reported.

In patients with moderate hepatic impairment 
classified as Child Pugh B, limited safety data are 
available; the efficacy of Vargatef has not been 
investigated. In patients with severe hepatic 
impairment classified as Child Pugh C, the safety 
and efficacy of Vargatef have not been 
investigated. No patients with moderate or severe 
hepatic impairment have been identified among the 
reported post-marketing cases.

Treatment of patients with renal impairment
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine
Risk minimisation measures
The safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of 
Vargatef have not been studied in patients with 
compromised renal function. Less than 1% of a 
single dose of Vargatef is excreted via the kidney. 
Thus, renal function is not thought to have an 
impact on elimination and/or Vargatef plasma 
levels. The reported events from post-marketing in 
patients with renal impairment are consistent with 
the known safety profile of nintedanib 
administered in combination with docetaxel and 
the advanced tumour disease, with no information 
to suggest any new safety concern.

Treatment of patients with healing wounds
Evidence for linking the risk to the

Risk minimisation measures
Due to its mechanism of action, Vargatef may 
impair wound healing. Consequently, patients with 
major injuries and/or surgery within 10 days prior 
to trial randomisation, or with incomplete wound 
healing, were excluded from trial 1199.13. No 
formal studies investigating the effect of Vargatef 
on wound healing have been performed. The 
available information about the safety of Vargatef 
in patients with healing wounds from post-
marketing is very limited.

Treatment of subpopulations with co-morbid CNS conditions such as dementia, 
depression, brain metastasis, or with co-morbid conditions such as arthritis and 
osteoporosis
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine
Risk minimisation measures
Patients with active brain metastases were 
excluded from trial 1199.13 because of a potential 
risk of intracranial bleeding and a potential for 
progression of neurological symptoms. 
In trial 1199.13, a limited number of patients in 
both treatment arms had stable brain metastases. 
No intracranial haemorrhage has been reported in 
trial 1199.13. In cases from post-marketing, it is 
not possible to identify whether a patient had active 
or stable brain metastases. The reported events in 
patients with brain metastases reflect the advanced 
tumour disease or consequences of the brain 
metastases. Otherwise, the reported events are 
consistent with the known safety profile of 
nintedanib administered in combination with 
docetaxel.
In trial 1199.13, there were no patients with 
dementia at baseline. The available information 
about the safety of Vargatef in patients with 
dementia from post-marketing is very limited.
In trial 1199.13, the number of patients with 
depression, arthritis, and osteoporosis was too 
small to allow for a meaningful analysis. The 
events reported from post-marketing in patients 
with depression and in patients with osteoporosis 
are consistent with the known safety profile of 
Vargatef and the advanced tumour disease. The 
events reported in patients with arthritis are 
consistent with the known safety profile of 
Vargatef, the advanced tumour disease, and pre-
existing disorders/concomitant medications in 
these patients.

Treatment of patients weighing <50 kg
Evidence for linking the risk to the

Risk minimisation measures
In the pivotal clinical trial of Vargatef (trial 
1199.13), only a small number of patients weighed 
less than 50 kg, both in the overall population 
(Vargatef: 32 patients; placebo: 34 patients) and in 
the adenocarcinoma population (Vargatef: 
17 patients; placebo: 20 patients). Population PK 
analyses showed an inverse correlation between 
body weight and exposure to nintedanib.
In the post-marketing setting, many patients with a 
weight lower than 50 kg are experiencing tumour 
progression or consequences of tumour 
progression. The remaining events are consistent 
with the known safety profile of Vargatef, and 
docetaxel or events that are related to the 
underlying NSCLC.

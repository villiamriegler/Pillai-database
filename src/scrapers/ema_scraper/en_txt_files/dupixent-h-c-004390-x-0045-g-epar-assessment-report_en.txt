2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
The purpose of this application is to extend the initially authorised indication of Dupixent to include the 
treatment of Asthma in children from 6 to 11 years old as add-on maintenance treatment for severe 
asthma with type 2 inflammation characterised by raised blood eosinophils and/or raised fraction of 
exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) who are inadequately controlled with medium to high dose ICS plus 
another medicinal product for maintenance treatment. The MAH also applied for a new strength 
(100mg) to be used in the posologic regimen proposed for this new indication. 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Asthma is a complex, heterogeneous disease that can affect persons of all ages. Asthma is 
characterized by chronic airway inflammation and variable expiratory airflow limitation that is often 
reversible. Symptoms vary over time and in intensity and can include wheezing, shortness of breath, 
chest tightness, and cough. Children with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma are at risk for 
future respiratory complications, including asthma exacerbations, which can be life-threatening at 
times, and progressive lung function decline. These children are at increased risk for abnormal patterns 
of lung growth, including reductions in maximal lung function achieved or early decline in lung 
function. Progressive lung function decline can lead to fixed airflow obstruction or even the 
development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at a young age. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood, affecting over 8% of children in the United 
States (US), and over 9% of children in the European Union (EU), with a worldwide prevalence 
estimated at almost 12%. Over one-third of children with asthma in the US and Western Europe have 
a disease that can be characterized as moderate-to-severe, with around 19% of children having a 
disease characterized as moderate, and around 2% with severe disease.  
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
While asthma is heterogeneous with multiple environmental and intrinsic causes, the most common 
driver in children is type 2 inflammation. Type 2 inflammation is the most common underlying driver of 
asthma and is present in up to 80% of children and half of all adults with asthma. This inflammatory 
process involves the downstream effects of both type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) and T-helper type 
2 (Th2) cell activation and is characterized by the release of signature cytokines interleukin (IL)-4, IL-
13, and IL-5. IL-5 plays a role in type 2 inflammation by promoting eosinophil maturation, 
proliferation, as well as activation and migration. IL-4 is a key driver of T-cell differentiation and 
induces the production of type-2-associated cytokines and chemokines. Both IL-4 and IL-13 are 
involved in B cell class switching from immunoglobulin G (IgG) to immunoglobulin E (IgE), and 
activation of mast cells, basophils, eosinophils, and IgE-producing plasma cells. Interleukin-13 
additionally mediates goblet cell hyperplasia, mucus production, and airway hyper-responsiveness. IL-
13 upregulates inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene expression, leading to increased nitric oxide 
(NO) release from respiratory epithelium, which can then be measured as fractional exhaled nitric 
oxide (FeNO), reflecting the degree of airway inflammation. In concert, these inflammatory pathways 
Assessment report  
EMA/98744/2022  
Page 8/88 
 
 
 
 
 
produce the clinical features of asthma, including variable airflow obstruction, airway hyper-
responsiveness, and mucus production. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation 
Asthma is characterized by airway inflammation with edema, cellular infiltrations and mucus plugging, 
variable airway obstruction and bronchial hyperresponsiveness in response to various triggers. Typical 
symptoms of asthma are wheezing, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and cough, especially 
nocturnal. Asthma is increasingly recognized as a heterogeneous disease and not all patients may 
respond similarly to current therapies or have the same clinical course. While current treatment 
options are fairly satisfactory for patients with milder disease, they are insufficient for 50% of adult 
asthma patients with moderate-to-severe uncontrolled disease. Low forced expiratory volume in 1 
second (FEV1) is a strong predictor of asthma exacerbations and progressive lung function decline, 
independent of symptom levels, especially if FEV1 is <60% predicted. FEV1 is a powerful predictor of 
general, pulmonary, and cardiovascular mortality. Research indicates that asthma itself and the use of 
asthma medications may be independently associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Studies of 
patients with asthma selected from the general population have shown increased all-cause mortality 
due to pulmonary causes, especially in patients with reduced lung function. These findings underscore 
the importance of preserving normal lung function in the management of asthma. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Current treatment guidelines 
The primary goal of asthma management in children is to achieve control of symptoms, optimize lung 
function, and decrease or eliminate asthma exacerbations while balancing the potential side effects of 
therapy. In addition, management of childhood asthma aims to reduce chronic underlying inflammation 
that, if left uncontrolled, may lead to non-reversible airflow limitation. The Global Initiative for Asthma 
(GINA) guidelines for the management of asthma in children age 6 to <12 years old centre on a 
stepwise approach to therapy, with incremental adjustments in controller therapy for each step (1-5) 
reflecting the frequency and extent of underlying symptoms. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the 
primary controller medication, and additional controllers include long-acting β2 agonists (LABAs), 
leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs), or long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs). Short-acting 
beta-2 agonists are used as-needed for rescue medication. Children meeting criteria for Step 4 and 5 
therapy experience symptoms most days, and standard of care treatment as of the GINA 2020 
includes medium-dose ICS plus a LABA, with other options including a high-dose ICS alone or with a 
second controller therapy. For children uncontrolled with this approach, additional add-on therapy 
options at Step 5 include systemic corticosteroids (SCS), anti-IgE (omalizumab) for patients with 
moderate-to-severe persistent or allergic asthma and elevated IgE, or anti-IL-5 (mepolizumab) for 
patients with elevated blood eosinophils. 
Inhaled corticosteroids(ICS) and Systemic Corticosteroids (SCS) carry known side effects, and 
therefore guidelines recommend using the minimum effective dose to maintain asthma control. While 
there is strong evidence that both ICS and SCS can prevent exacerbations and preserve lung function, 
there is little data to support added clinical benefit from increasing ICS above medium dose in children. 
In children, the long-term use of ICS can have negative impacts on growth, bone metabolism, and 
adrenal function. In addition to these adverse effects, short courses of SCS are additionally associated 
with acute mood changes and sleep disturbances.

Biomarker-led management approaches 
Predictive response biomarkers can aid in the diagnosis of asthma as well as the selection of 
appropriate targeted therapies for appropriate patients. The GINA guidelines for the management of 
asthma recommend using blood or sputum eosinophils, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), or other 
clinical characteristics to select the appropriate biologic therapy for patients with severe type 2 asthma 
that is not responding to the standard of care therapies. FeNO is produced at the respiratory 
epithelium as a direct result of IL-13 activation, and therefore uniquely reflects the level of type 2 
inflammation in the airways. FeNO levels have been associated with disease severity including 
exacerbation frequency, lung function, and mucosal airway inflammation. FeNO levels not only support 
the diagnosis of asthma in children and adults but can also identify patients that are likely to respond 
to ICS therapy. FeNO testing is simple, safe, and well-tolerated, even in patients with severe airflow 
obstruction and can be easily measured in children as young as 4 years old. FeNO levels ≥20 ppb are 
considered the cut-off for characterizing type 2 inflammation in paediatric and adult patients with 
asthma. American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society (ERS) recommends a similar 
cut-point of 20 ppb in children (25 ppb in adults) to identify the upper limit of “normal” FeNO values. 
Unmet medical need 
For paediatric patients with uncontrolled asthma, the options for add-on therapies beyond the standard 
of care therapies are relatively limited. A few targeted biologic therapies are available; however, the 
intended patient population for these therapeutics may be narrow, or clinical efficacy has yet to be 
demonstrated in randomized-controlled trials. The anti-IgE omalizumab has been approved for patients 
aged 6 years and older with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma (US), severe allergic asthma (EU), 
and evidence of positive skin test or in vitro reactivity to a perennial aeroallergen. In clinical trials, 
omalizumab reduced the annualized rate of exacerbation events in this population by 31%. The 
applicant states that the anti-IL-5 antibody mepolizumab has been approved in the US and EU for 
patients 6 to <12 years of age with severe refractory asthma and an eosinophilic phenotype and that 
this approval was based on a partial extrapolation approach from the adult population with limited 
placebo-controlled efficacy and safety data in the paediatric population. However, severe eosinophilic 
asthma is a rare disease (see also conclusion B/R) which hampers the recruitment for clinical studies 
and therefore extrapolation was performed. While it is known that children who have impaired lung 
function have a higher risk of significant fixed airflow obstruction as adults, neither anti-IgE nor anti-
IL-5 therapeutics has demonstrated a sustained ability to improve lung function in paediatric 
populations. Therefore, for patients with moderate-to-severe asthma who remain uncontrolled despite 
standard of care therapy, there is a need for a safe and effective therapy that can both effectively 
reduce exacerbations and improve lung function. 
2.2.  About the product 
Dupilumab is a human monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the IL-4 receptor alpha subunit 
(IL-4Rα), which is a component of IL-4 heterodimeric Type I (IL-4-ligand only) and Type II (both IL-4 
and IL-13 ligands) receptors. The binding of dupilumab to IL-4Rα results in blockade of downstream 
signalling initiated by both IL-4 and IL-13. IL-4 and IL-13 are key type 2 cytokines involved in type 2 
inflammatory diseases. 
Dupilumab is authorized for marketing in the US for use as an add-on maintenance treatment in 
patients aged 12 years and older with moderate-to-severe asthma with an eosinophilic phenotype or 
with oral corticosteroids (OCS)-dependent asthma; in the EU as an add-on maintenance treatment for 
adult and adolescent (12 years and older) patients with severe asthma with type 2 inflammation 
characterized by raised blood eosinophils and/or raised FeNO who are inadequately controlled with 
high-dose ICS plus another medicinal product, and in Japan for use in adults and adolescents (≥12 
Assessment report  
EMA/98744/2022  
Page 10/88 
 
 
 
years of age) with severe or refractory bronchial asthma. Dupilumab is also approved in multiple 
regions for the treatment of adults and adolescents with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) 
and the treatment of patients aged 6 to <12 years old with moderate-to-severe AD in the US or with 
severe AD in the EU. In addition, dupilumab is approved for the treatment of adult patients with 
inadequately controlled chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) in the US, EU, and Japan.  
It is of note that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi continue to explore dupilumab as a potential 
treatment for additional type 2 inflammation-mediated disorders. 
2.3.  Type of Application and aspects on development 
The current submission dossier is an extension of the Marketing Authorization application for asthma 
patients 6 to <12 years of age. The results of the completed Phase 3 efficacy/safety study (EFC14153) 
and the ongoing open-label extension study (LTS14424) in patients aged 6 to <12 years are presented 
in this application. 
In the EFC14153 study, patients with asthma aged 6 to <12 years on background controller therapy 
with medium or high dose ICS in combination with a second controller or with high dose ICS alone 
were evaluated. The clinical benefits of dupilumab were observed both for patients on medium or high 
dose ICS at baseline. In children, providers must limit the use of high dose ICS unless clearly 
indicated. Studies have demonstrated that there is limited data to support additional clinical benefit 
with increasing ICS from medium to high dose ICS in this population, while side effects of higher dose 
ICS can include reduced growth velocity and impact on the HPA axis. Hence, the applicant is proposing 
for this extension an indication similar to the adults and adolescents in severe asthma with type 2 
inflammation with the exception that the population 6 to <12 years of age includes patients on 
medium to high dose ICS; ie, Dupixent is indicated in children aged 6 to <12 years old as add-on 
maintenance treatment for severe asthma with type 2 inflammation characterized by raised blood 
eosinophils and/or FeNO, who are inadequately controlled with medium to high dose ICS plus another 
medicinal product for maintenance treatment. According to GINA severe asthma is a condition that 
remains uncontrolled despite high dose ICS-LABA or that requires high dose ICS-LABA to prevent 
becoming uncontrolled. 
Finally, the submission dossier, written in a global context, proposes to update the adult and 
adolescent US and US reference countries’ indication statement to reflect the demonstration of both 
blood eosinophils and FeNO as predictive biomarkers. Both of these biomarkers are already 
incorporated into the approved indication statement in the EU and EU reference countries.  
Dupilumab was approved by the US FDA on 19 October 2018 for the treatment of adults and 
adolescents with moderate-to-severe asthma with an eosinophilic phenotype or with OCS-dependent 
asthma. Dupilumab was also approved by the European Commission (EC) on 6 May 2019 for use in 
adults and adolescents 12 years and older as an add-on maintenance treatment for severe asthma 
with type 2 inflammation characterized by raised blood eosinophils and/or raised FeNO, who are 
inadequately controlled with high dose ICS plus another medicinal product for maintenance treatment, 
and in Japan on 26 March 2019, for use in adults and adolescents (≥12 years) with severe or 
refractory bronchial asthma.

2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The proposed finished product is presented as a solution for subcutaneous injection containing 100 mg 
of dupilumab (150 mg/mL) as active substance.  
Other ingredients are: arginine hydrochloride, histidine, polysorbate 80 (E433), sodium acetate 
trihydrate, glacial acetic acid (E260), sucrose and water for injections. 
The product is available in a siliconised type-1 clear glass pre-filled syringe (PFS) with needle shield, 
with a fixed 27 gauge 12.7 mm (½ inch), thin wall stainless steel staked needle as described in section 
6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.4.2.  Active Substance 
2.4.2.1.  General information 
There is no change to the active substance information or quality. The authorised formulated active 
substance dupilumab 150 mg/mL is used for the manufacture of the proposed new dose Dupixent 100 
mg and is the same as used for the manufacture of the authorised dose Dupixent 300 mg. Therefore, 
the approved active substance and formulated active substance sections are applicable and no 
additional sections are needed to support the present submission. 
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
This line extension application includes the addition of the new dosage strength 100 mg in a pre-filled 
syringe with safety system (PFS-S). The same active substance and 150 mg/mL dupilumab formulated 
active substance is used to manufacture 100 mg Dupixent as is currently authorised for the 
manufacture of 300 mg Dupixent. Essentially, the 150 mg/mL dupilumab formulated active substance 
is aseptically filled at a lower volume (0.67 mL) in a smaller primary container to yield the new 100 mg 
dose.  
The filled volume and the syringe size (1 mL) have been adjusted for the lower volume (0.67 mL) used 
for the 100 mg dose.  
The 100 mg bulk PFS uses the same primary container closure components (syringe, needle shield, 
and plunger stopper) as the authorised 200 mg bulk PFS which uses the 175 mg/mL dupilumab 
concentration with a slightly different formulation. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. Dupilumab finished 
product contains no excipients of human or animal origin. 
The primary packaging is a siliconised type-1 clear glass pre-filled syringe (PFS) with needle shield, 
with a fixed 27 gauge 12.7 mm (½ inch), thin wall stainless steel staked needle. The material complies 
with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by 
stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.

The primary packaging of the 100 mg bulk PFS with rigid needle shield (RNS) is the same as the 200 
mg bulk PFS with RNS. Device constituent parts of the PFS-S for the 100 mg dupilumab PFS-S are the 
same as for the commercialized 200 mg dupilumab PFS-S: syringe glass barrel with staked needle and 
RNS, plunger stopper, plunger rod, finger flange, safety system. The device has no CE mark.  
The applicant confirmed that the pre-filled syringe used for the delivery of dupilumab 100 mg is a 
device that is fully integrated at the time of placing on the market (i.e. no assembly of the medicine 
part is needed before administration). 
This device has been developed under applicable good manufacturing practice (GMP) and all applicable 
medical device regulations including design control, risk management and relevant purchasing control 
provisions such as 21 CFR part 4 – Regulation of Combination Products and applicable parts of ISO-
13485 Medical devices – Quality management systems – Requirements for regulatory purposes. 
Device requirements of the device constituent parts of the bulk PFS with RNS fulfill ISO 11040 – Pre-
filled Syringes Part 4: Glass Barrels for injectables and sterilized sub-assembled syringes ready for 
filling and FDA Guidance for Industry Container Closure Systems for Packaging Human Drugs and 
Biologics; and are classified according to the five categories as described per FDA Guidance plus 
sterilisation item. 
The leachable evaluation of the bulk PFS container closure did not identify any leachables of 
toxicological concern. 
Manufacturing process development 
Dupilumab 150 mg/mL is currently filled into a 2.25 mL syringe (300 mg dose) ; the dupilumab 100 
mg dose (0.67 mL of dupilumab 150 mg/mL in 1 mL syringe) is introduced with the same 
manufacturing process. 
The current manufacturing process of dupilumab 150 mg/mL consists of the following steps: 
• Step I - Thawing of dupilumab 150 mg/mL formulated drug substance 
• Step II - Pooling and mixing of dupilumab 150 mg/mL formulated drug substance 
• Step III - Prefiltration of formulated drug substance 
• Step IVa - In-line sterilizing filtration 
• Step IVb - Filling and stoppering 
• Step V - 100% Visual Inspection 
Manufacturing operations of thawing, pooling and mixing, prefiltration and in-line sterilisation remain 
the same. There is no change to the currently approved areas, equipment and process parameters of 
these manufacturing steps. 
The filling and stoppering process for the 100 mg dose syringe uses the same trained pool of 
personnel; the 100 mg dose consists of filling and stoppering a new volume of dupilumab 150 mg/mL 
in a new container closure system. 
Capability studies demonstrated the ability of the filling machine to meet the defined filling volume 
specifications. 
The presented data of the dupilumab bulk PFS lots filled showed similar stability profiles under long-
term storage conditions, thereby confirming the similar nature of the material and that the differences 
between processes at the two sites did not affect protein quality up to 36 months under long-term 
storage conditions. In the D120 response document, the MAH provided a comparison of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/98744/2022

degradation profiles of the 100 mg dupilumab bulk PFS lots filled after storage at accelerated 
conditions which demonstrated that finished product manufactured degraded as expected and had 
similar degradation profiles to one another during the accelerated stability studies. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product manufacturers involved in the manufacture of 100 mg Dupixent are authorised 
finished product manufacturers currently involved in the manufacture of the authorised doses of 
Dupixent 300 mg and 200 mg. There are no new active substance, formulated active substance or 
finished product manufacturers involved in the manufacture of 100 mg Dupixent. 
Compared with the batch size for 300 mg Dupixent, the batch size for the manufacture of 100 mg 
Dupixent is smaller. A batch size range of, expressed as the amount of 150 mg/mL formulated drug 
substance (FDS) used to manufacture a batch of 100 mg bulk PFS has been defined based on 
validation studies. Mixing of more than one batch of FDS is allowed to reach the batch size. 
The differences in manufacturing process conditions (Critical Process Parameters (CPPs), Critical in-
process controls (CIPCs), Holding times (HTs) and Time out of refrigeration (TOR)) between the 100 
mg dose and the 300 mg dose were adequately described and defined/verified following process 
validation. 
The manufacturing process and process controls for the dupilumab 100 mg PFS-S assembly process is 
the same as for the authorised dupilumab 200 mg PFS-S. There is no change to the currently approved 
process parameters and in-process controls (IPC) of these manufacturing steps except for the global 
time out of refrigeration (TOR) validated for the 100 mg PFS-S during the assembly process validation 
and applicable in routine manufacturing. 
Validation of manufacturing occurred on three batches of dupilumab 100 mg solution in bulk PFS 
followed by assembly process validation on three batches. The collection and evaluation of in-process 
controls and release testing data from the validation batches of dupilumab demonstrated that the 
process operated within the defined process parameters while applying maximum hold times and time 
out of refrigeration. All validation batches confirmed that the process can consistently produce bulk PFS 
and final finished product as PFS-S in a robust manner, meeting quality release specifications. 
Filled bulk PFS (RNS) syringes were used for the assembly of the PFS-S. The PFS-S validation batches 
confirmed that the process can consistently reproduce assembly operations and is capable of producing 
finished product in PFS-S in a robust manner thus meeting quality release specifications. 
Release results of the 100 mg Bulk PFS and PFS-S process validation (PV) batches met the 
specifications valid at time of validation runs and the stricter acceptance criteria of current 
specifications and demonstrated satisfactory consistency among the three batches. 
The dupilumab 300 mg critical process parameters have been confirmed to also be appropriate for 
dupilumab 100 mg with a lower batch size and lower filling volume with a different plunger stopper 
position.  
Studies have been conducted to provide evidence for manufacturing process asepsis of 100 mg bulk 
PFS. Validation of aseptic processing filling lines includes a process simulation test using microbial 
growth medium (Media Fill Tests). The maximum holding time of the prefiltered solution storage into 
the single-use bag assembly applicable for commercial production is limited by storage holding time 
validated during aseptic process simulation runs (Media Fill). 
As part of microbiological attributes, the sterility (in conjunction with the Container Closure Integrity 
Test (CCIT) is monitored as part of batch release and stability testing.

The 100 mg PFS-S simulated shipping validation studies were performed according to ASTM D4169 
Standard Practices for Performance Testing of Shipping Containers and Systems, including road, air 
and sea freight. Simulated shipping validation results are acceptable. 
Product specification  
The formulation and therefore all excipients and their concentrations used in 100 mg Dupixent are 
identical to those used in the authorised 300 mg Dupixent since both finished products are 
manufactured from 150 mg/mL dupilumab formulated active substance.  
Resulting from the same concentration of the active ingredient (150 mg/mL dupilumab) and identical 
formulation, the specifications and acceptance criteria for 100 mg PFS-S are identical to the authorised 
specifications and acceptance criteria for the 300 mg PFS-S, except for expellable volume. 
The specifications covers product solution properties, identity, strength, purity, potency and syringe 
with safety system performance properties. The specifications and acceptance criteria for 100 mg bulk 
PFS and 100 mg PFS-S are satisfactorily justified in CTD 3.2.P.5.6. Specifications for 100 mg bulk PFS 
are provided in the CTD section P.3.4. 
The device-related functional performance specific specifications among 100 mg PFS-S and 300 mg 
PFS-S are the same irrespective of the different syringe size used. 
The key elements described for the active substance specifications are also in many cases applicable 
for the finished product. 
Analytical methods 
Brief information on the analytical procedures applied for the 100 mg Dupixent has been provided. 
New method summary attachments for container closure integrity, and for sterility are provided. 
Container closure integrity (CCI) is introduced for 100 mg primary stability testing only. Descriptions of 
other analytical procedures applicable for 100 mg Dupixent have already been approved for either 300 
mg or 200 mg Dupixent. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data on three batches of the finished product were provided. The results are within the 
specifications and confirm consistency of the manufacturing process.  
Stability of the product 
A shelf life of 36 months is claimed for the 100 mg bulk PFS when stored at 2°C - 8°C. 
The new strength 100 mg Dupixent uses the primary container closure system authorised for 200 mg 
Dupixent (175 mg/mL dupilumab in 1 mL syringe). Bulk PFS batches used in the stability studies were 
manufactured at two sites. The comparability of the syringes is appropriately addressed and a 
comparable stability profile has been confirmed. 
The test parameters and test intervals for the primary stability lot long-term, accelerated, and stress 
stability studies are satisfactory.

Three lots of dupilumab 100 mg bulk PFS were selected as primary stability batches. These lots are 
considered representative of the intended commercial process and presentation with minor differences 
in the non-product contacting components. 
A shelf life of 36 months is proposed for 100 mg bulk PFS when stored at 5 ± 3 °C based on 36 
months of acceptable data for three representative primary stability 100 mg bulk PFS lots.  
Stability data from bulk PFS lots manufactured at demonstrate stability over 24 months at 2-8°C. 
Additional bulk PFS batch demonstrates stability up to the 36-month time point. 
Minimal dupilumab degradation and little change in any attribute was observed in primary and 
confirmatory stability batches during storage at the long-term condition of 5 ± 3°C up to the latest 
time points tested. No significant changes were observed in the primary stability lots during storage. 
No change was observed in expellable volume. No changes indicating loss of container closure integrity 
(sterility or endotoxin) were observed in any stability lots during storage at the long-term condition, to 
date. Out of specification (OOS) results for were observed which were adequately discussed in the Day 
120 response document. The conclusions from the investigation can be accepted and the issue be 
considered as solved. The MAH confirmed that the discussion of the OOS will be implemented in 
3.2.P.8.1 Stability Summary and Conclusions – Bulk PFS – 100 mg with the submission of the 
completed stability data for the 100 mg bulk PFS. An OOS was observed for expellable volume for one 
batch which was back in specification at later time points. The potential root cause is the filling 
machine scale. The corrective action was implemented on the filling line. An additional commercially 
representative batch was manufactured to confirm the effectiveness of the corrective action. 
Following storage under stress conditions, the expected degradation profile was observed. Little to no 
change was observed in tests related to performance after storage at the stress condition. 
Stability studies under accelerated (6 months) and stress conditions (3 months) have been completed. 
For 100 mg bulk PFS, the claimed shelf life of 36 months is acceptable based on satisfactory 36 
months stability data of primary 100 mg bulk PFS batches and confirmatory 100 mg bulk PFS data. 
For 100 mg PFS-S, a shelf life of 36 months from the date of fill is proposed when stored at 5 ± 3 °C 
and protected from light during storage.  
Stability data are available through the 24-month time point for lots of 100 mg dupilumab in PFS-S 
after storage at the long-term condition at 5 ± 3°C. Dupilumab continued to meet the acceptance 
criteria for the monitored attributes after storage at 5 ± 3 °C up to the 24-month time point. Overall 
little degradation was observed to date in any of the batches following 24 months of storage at the 
long-term condition.  
The proposed shelf life for 100 mg Dupixent PFS-S of 3 years from the date of fill when stored at 2°C - 
8°C and protected from light during storage can be accepted based on 100 mg PFS-S stability batches 
demonstrating satisfactory stability at real-time conditions 2-8°C for 24 months and 100 mg bulk PFS 
batches demonstrating stability at 2-8°C for 36 months.  
The MAH is recommended to provide an update of primary and confirmatory stability studies in 
sections P.8.1 and P.8.3 upon completion of the studies. (Recommendation) 
Based on available stability data, the shelf life of 3 years when stored at 2°C - 8°C as stated in the 
SmPC are acceptable. If necessary, pre-filled syringes may be kept at room temperature up to 25°C 
for a maximum of 14 days. It should not be stored above 25°C. After removal from the refrigerator, 
Dupixent must be used within 14 days or discarded.

Adventitious agents 
There is no change to the approved adventitious agents safety evaluation and the existing data 
adequately covers also the new strength. 
Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
This line extension application includes the addition of a new dosage strength of 100 mg in pre-filled 
syringe with safety system (PFS-S). The same active substance and 150 mg/mL dupilumab formulated 
active substance is used to manufacture 100 mg Dupixent as is currently authorised for the 
manufacture of 300 mg Dupixent. Essentially, the 150 mg/mL dupilumab FDS is aseptically filled at a 
lower volume (0.67 mL) in a smaller primary container to yield the new 100 mg dose. 
Finished product specifications for 100 mg Dupixent match those of 300 mg Dupixent except for the 
parameter expellable volume. The primary container used for 100 mg Dupixent PFS-S is the same 1-
mL syringe as that authorised for 200 mg Dupixent PFS-S.  
The manufacturing process steps of the 100 mg bulk PFS dose are the same as for the 300 mg dose 
(2.0 mL of dupilumab 150 mg/mL in a 2.25 mL syringe) except for batch size, filling (weight range) 
and stoppering recipe (plunger stopper position). The differences in manufacturing process conditions 
(CPPs, CIPCs, HTs and TOR) between the 100 mg dose and the 300 mg dose were adequately 
described and defined/verified following process validation. 
The manufacturing process and process controls for the dupilumab 100 mg PFS-S assembly process is 
the same as for the authorised dupilumab 200 mg PFS-S. There is no change to the currently approved 
process parameters and in-process controls (IPC) of these manufacturing steps except for the Global 
Time Out of Refrigeration (TOR) validated for 100mg PFS-S during assembly process validation and 
applicable in routine manufacturing. 
The clarification provided with the response on D120 LoQ on a new analytical procedure added for 
container closure integrity used in stability testing is acceptable.  
Stability data have been updated for 100 mg bulk PFS and PFS-S as well as regarding the 
comparability of commercial and clinical finished product.  
The proposed shelf life for 100 mg Dupixent PFS-S of 3 years from the date of fill when stored at 2°C - 
8°C and protected from light during storage can be accepted based on 100 mg PFS-S stability batches 
demonstrating satisfactory stability at real-time conditions 2-8°C for 24 months and 100 mg bulk PFS 
batches demonstrating stability at 2-8°C for 36 months. The MAH committed to provide an update of 
primary and confirmatory stability studies in sections P.8.1 and P.8.3 upon completion of the studies. 
The letter of recommendation has been updated accordingly. 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
as defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
The package on clinical pharmacology regarding children aged ≥6 to <12 years with uncontrolled 
moderate-to-severe asthma comprises two phase-3 clinical studies with SC dupilumab in which PK and 
PD data have been collected. In the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study EFC14153, 
patients were treated with either 100 mg dupilumab (body weight ≤30 kg) (n=91), 200 mg dupilumab 
(body weight >30 kg) (n=179) or placebo (n=135) q2w for a maximum of 52 weeks (in sum, 405 
were treated, 270 with dupilumab and 135 with placebo). Eligible patients who completed the 
treatment period of this study (including patients of the placebo group) were offered the opportunity to 
participate in the ongoing 1-year long-term open-label extension study LTS14424 (n=365), during 
which dosing regimens of 100 mg q2w or 300 mg q4w for children with a body weight ≤30 kg (n=62) 
and 200 mg q2w for children with a body weight >30 kg (n=303) were assessed. Patients with body 
weight ≤30 kg were treated with 100 mg q2w prior to protocol amendment 03, dated 12 December 
2019. After the amendment approval, children with body weight ≤30 kg with ≥8 weeks remaining 
before the planned end of treatment were switched to 300 mg q4w, based on data from the pivotal 
study R668-AD-1652 in children with AD.  
Sparse sampling schemes were utilized in both of the studies, EFC14153 and LTS14424, with samples 
collected at weeks 0 (predose), 6 (study EFC14153 only), 12, 24, 52 (on-treatment) and 64 (follow-
up). 
Analytical methods 
The method applied for detection of functional dupilumab was employed in previous dupilumab 
applications and has been accurately validated. Incurred sample reanalysis was conducted in asthma 
study EFC14153 and confirmed that the assay produced robust and reproducible results in the 
paediatric asthma population with an ISR passing rate of 98%. 
In general, the methods applied for the detection of anti-dupilumab antibodies and neutralizing 
antibodies correspond to methods already utilized and described in previous applications.  
For the detection of ADAs in paediatric asthma studies EFC14153 and LTS14424, updated assay 
method REGN668-AV-15153-VA-01V2 was employed. Assay updates were associated with the ADA 
assay cut point for the asthma population, selection of a lower level of low-quality control (LQC), and 
an assessment of sensitivity and drug tolerance level (DTL) using the screening asthma ADA cut point 
factor (CF). 
Pop PK 
A pop PK analysis was conducted using pooled data from the Phase 3 studies in children 6 to <12 
years of age with asthma to characterize dupilumab PK, compare exposure between indication (Asthma 
vs AD) and across age groups, and assess the influence of extrinsic and intrinsic factors on dupilumab 
PK variability. In addition, this model was used to simulate dupilumab concentrations over time for the 
alternative regimen of 300 mg q4w in children 6 to <12 years of age with asthma. 
The final pop PK dataset contained 1772 dupilumab concentrations from 377 children 6 to <12 years of 
age with asthma with a body weight range of 16.4 kg to 67.2 kg. In the final dataset, PK data following 
300 mg q4w dose was very limited (N=2 patients in weight group of ≤30 kg, one from dupilumab 
treatment group and the other from placebo group of study EFC14153), which resulted in only two PK 
samples. 
Assessment report  
EMA/98744/2022  
Page 20/88 
 
 
 
The pop PK model in the paediatric population with asthma used the same model structure as the 
previously developed global base model.  
The PK of dupilumab in children 6 to <12 years of age with asthma was described by a 2-compartment 
model with first-order absorption kinetics, and parallel linear and nonlinear elimination parameterized 
in terms of a first-order Ke and Michaelis-Menten parameters. 
Among the tested covariates, only body weight was identified to be a statistical significant covariate on 
dupilumab PK in children 6 to <12 years of age with asthma, and included as a time-varying covariate 
on V2, Ke, and Vmax. 
Overall, model diagnostics indicate no major deviations or miss-specifications. Nevertheless, PK data is 
indicated to be highly variably. 
ADME 
Population PK model estimates for SC bioavailability and absorption rate constant were comparable 
between adults/adolescents and children 6 to < 12 years of age with asthma (SC bioavailability is 63% 
in children and 61% in adults/adolescents; Ka is 0.252/day in children and 0.263/day in 
adults/adolescents). 
Dupilumab distributes primarily within the vascular compartment. Model-estimated volume of 
distribution at steady state (Vss) in children 6 to <12 years of age is 3.7 L. 
The PK of dupilumab is characterized as nonlinear with parallel linear and nonlinear elimination 
pathways (target-mediated clearance).  
Based on pop PK results, the derived linear clearance (CL), based on normalization by the median 
weight of the respective age group increases with age because of CL increase with body weight and 
body weight increase with age. 
Dose proportionality and time dependency 
Exposure in terms of AUC, Cmax and Ctrough_ss increased less than proportional with dose (100 mg 
q2w, 200 mg q2w) as indicated by Phase 3 data and exposure simulations. 
In Study EFC14153, steady-state was achieved by Week 12 and was maintained up to 52 weeks during 
treatment with 100 mg q2w and 200 mg q2w in children 6 to <12 years of age with asthma. The 
observed steady-state trough concentrations were consistent between Study EFC14153 and Study 
LTS14424. 
Based on the Pop PK model, the median time to steady-state was 14 weeks for 100 mg q2w and 200 
mg q2w, and up to 18 weeks (300 mg q4w) in children 6 to <12 years of age with asthma as reflected 
in section 5.2. of the SmPC. As no loading dose was administered time to steady-state is prolonged 
compared to adults and adolescents with asthma (8 weeks) where a loading dose was used. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
The observed variability (total %CV) of Ctrough,ss after repeated SC doses of dupilumab 100 mg q2w 
or 200 mg q2w in the children 6 to <12 years of age with asthma was in the range of 47.9% to 52.8% 
(study EFC14153).  
The magnitude of estimated IIV was modest for the central volume of distribution V2 (CV% = 25.4%) 
and elimination rate Ke (CV% = 16.1%). 
While IIV on Ke was decreased by introducing time-varying weight effects, IIV on the central volume of 
distribution was increased (from 10.4 to 16.1 %CV).

Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Mean (SD) predicted steady-state exposure in children 6 to <12 years of age with asthma 
Following administration of 100 mg q2w and 200 mg q2w doses of dupilumab in children 6 to <12 
years of age with a body weight ≤30 kg and >30 kg, dupilumab Ctrough,ss values (mean ± SD) were 
58.4 ± 28.0 mg/L and 85.1 ± 44.9 mg/L, respectively.  
Model-based simulations overall indicate dupilumab exposure at the doses tested in the Phase 3 study 
EFC14153 in children 6 to <12 years of age with asthma (100 mg q2w in children with body weight ≤ 
30 kg and 200 mg q2w in children with body weight >30 kg) to be lower than the Cmax achieved in 
adults with asthma treated with 300 mg qw, and exceeded the exposure (Ctrough,ss) achieved with 
200 mg q2w in adults with asthma.  
Following 300 mg q4w, median Ctrough ss was estimated to 42.7 mg/L (30-60 kg) and 91.7 mg/L (15-
30 kg), with percentiles to 14.6 mg/L (p5) and 96.4 mg/L (p95) and  41.9 mg/L (p5) and 177.2 (p95), 
respectively. The mean Ctrough,ss in children with body weight ≥30 kg to <60 kg receiving 300 mg 
q4w (48.0 mg/L) was similar to the observed Ctrough, ss in adolescent patients receiving 200 mg q2w 
(50.7 mg/L). The mean Cmax, ss in children with body weight ≥30 kg to <60 kg receiving 300 mg q4w 
(102 mg/L) was 40% lower than that observed in adult patients receiving 300 mg qw (171 mg/L). The 
mean Cmax,ss in children with body weight ≥15 kg to <30 kg receiving 300 mg q4w (170 mg/L) was 
similar to that observed in adult patients receiving 300 mg qw (171 mg/L). 
Ctrough at steady state was within the range of the two regimens approved in adults and adolescents 
with asthma (200 mg q2w and 300 mg q2w). 
Comparison of pop PK models reflects the fact the weight influence on Vmax (target-mediated CL) was 
needed and kept in the asthma pop PK model in contrast to AD. That might also be the source of 
variability in exposure in asthma vs AD. Simulations show that exposure in the asthma population is 
constantly slightly below the one in the corresponding AD weight category. 
Overall, PK data and pop PK indicates similarity in PK across indication and age groups (after 
accounting for differences in body weight). 
Mean (SD) trough concentration-time profiles in children 6 to <12 years of age, adults and adolescents 
with asthma 
Special populations  
Besides weight, all other tested covariates, were not found to have a statistically significant effect on 
dupilumab PK in children 6 to <12 years of age with asthma. 
Prominent impact of weight on PK parameters (linear, non-linear clearance and volume of distribution) 
and consequently on exposure in each weight category (15-30 kg, 30-60 kg) was observed. This also 
led to the proposed weight tierd posology in children 6 to <12 years of age with asthma is: 
• For children with body weight ≥15 kg to <30 kg: 100 mg q2w or 300 mg q4w 
• For children with body weight ≥30 kg to <60 kg: 200 mg q2w or 300 mg q4w 
• For children with body weight ≥60 kg: 200 mg q2w. 
For 100 mg q2w dose regimen, dupilumab exposures increased with a decrease in body weight over 
the analysis range of 19.6 - 29.8 kg (median 26 kg). For a decrease in body weight from 26 kg to 19.6 
kg (the 5th percentile weight of 100 mg q2w), the increase in AUCτ,ss and Ctrough,ss was 41.7% and 
45.8%, respectively. For an increase in body weight from 26 kg to 29.8 kg (the 95th percentile weight

Page 22/88 
 
 
 
of 100 mg q2w), the decrease in AUCτ,ss and Ctrough,ss was 14.8% and 16.0%, respectively. Similar 
trend was found for Cmax,ss. 
For 200 mg q2w dose regimen, dupilumab exposures increased with a decrease in body weight over 
the analysis range of 31- 59.3 kg (median 38.6 kg). For a decrease in body weight from 38.6 kg to 31 
kg (the 5th percentile weight of 200 mg q2w), the increase in AUCτ,ss and Ctrough,ss was 32.0% and 
35.2%, respectively. For an increase in body weight from 38.6 kg to 59.3 kg (the 95th percentile 
weight of 200 mg q2w), the decrease in AUCτ,ss and Ctrough,ss was 42.6% and 45.9%, respectively. 
Similar trend was found for Cmax,ss. 
For 300 mg q4w dose regimen in 15-<30 kg group, dupilumab exposures increased with a decrease in 
body weight over the analysis range of 19.6-29.8 kg (median 26 kg). The body weight effect translated 
to a 15.6% lower steady-state AUCτ,ss for a typical patient with a body weight of 29.8 kg (the 95th 
percentile of the weight range) and a 37.5% higher AUCτ,ss for a typical patient with a body weight of 
19.6 kg (the 5th percentile), as compared with a typical patient with a body weight of 26.0 kg (the 
median weight). Similar trend was found for Ctrough,ss and Cmax,ss. 
For 300 mg q4w dose regimen in 30-<60 kg group, dupilumab exposures increased with a decrease in 
body weight over the analysis range of 31-59.3 kg (median 38.6 kg). The body weight effect translated 
to a 45.1% lower steady-state AUCτ,ss for a typical patient with a body weight of 59.3 kg (the 95th 
percentile of the weight range) and a 33.4% higher AUCτ,ss for a typical patient with a body weight of 
31.0 kg (the 5th percentile), as compared with a typical patient with a body weight of 38.6 kg (the 
median weight). Similar trend was found for Ctrough,ss and Cmax,ss. 
With regards to disease, for the 100 mg q2w or 200 mg q2w dose regimens, the observed dupilumab 
Ctrough-values in children 6 to <12 years of age with asthma are similar to those with AD. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Based on the comparison of Pop PK predicted post hoc estimates of individual steady-state exposure, 
the concomitant use of controller medications (LABA, and systemic corticosteroids) had no apparent 
effect on dupilumab PK. 
The impact of methylxanthines and leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) on dupilumab PK exposure 
could not be assessed due to limited data. 
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Biomarkers 
Biomarkers of type 2 inflammation, including blood eosinophils, serum IgE, serum TARC, and the 
FeNO, were assessed in study EFC14153, and blood eosinophil and serum IgE measurement was 
continued in study LTS14424. 
Dupilumab has been shown to consistently induce a rapid and sustained reduction in FeNO and TARC, 
as well as a progressive reduction of total IgE., while blood eosinophils was not a response PD 
biomarker for dupilumab treatment. In study LTS14424, mean total IgE in dupilumab-treated patients 
enrolled from study EFC14153 continued to decrease throughout the study treatment period. As 
expected, the mean total IgE in placebo-treated patients enrolled from Study EFC14153 decreased 
following dupilumab treatment in study LTS14424.  
The treatment effect of dupilumab on type 2 inflammation biomarkers over time was similar in children 
6 to <12 years of age to that observed in adults and adolescents with asthma.

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Immunogenicity 
Immunogenicity was analysed in both Phase 3 clinical studies children ≥6 to <12 years of age with 
asthma. The ADA response in children with asthma was low and consistent with that observed in 
children with AD of the same age group and at the same dupilumab dose. It was further consistent 
across age groups in patients with asthma. 
PK/PD and exposure-response 
Overall, PK/PD analyses indicated a clinically significant reduction in severe exacerbation rate and 
improvement in per cent predicted FEV1 change from baseline for both the 100 mg q2w and 200 mg 
q2w dose regimens in children 6 to <12 years of age with asthma. Treatment effect approaches near 
plateau of the E-R curve over the exposure range achieved at 100 mg q2w and 200 mg q2w. PK/PD 
relationships of key efficacy endpoints in children 6 to <12 years of age and in adult and adolescent 
patients with asthma are considered comparable in the exposure range at the therapeutic doses (dose 
regimens evaluated in the pivotal Phase 3 studies) across age groups in asthma populations.  
As similarity in exposure-response relationships across age groups in asthma population is indicated, 
no meaningful difference between the proposed alternative dose regimen of 300 mg q4w and the 100 
mg q2w/200 mg q2w evaluated in Study EFC14153 is expected. 
No definite exposure-response relationship concerning safety was provided. Given the acceptable 
safety profile and exposure predicted to be lower than that at the highest dose tested (300 mg qw in 
adults), this is acceptable. 
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Clinical studies 
Up to the updated data cut-off date of 26 May 2021, 18 patients with body weight ≤ 30kg were 
exposed to the 300 mg q4w schedule in study LTS14424. PK data of 17 patients out of 18 patients 
treated with the 300mg q4w dose regimen are now available. 
All of the patients that were treated with the 300 mg q4w scheme switched from other regimes (100 
mg q2w regimen in almost all cases, placebo regimen in one case) the timepoints of switching to the 
300 mg q4w regime were disclosed. The closest time interval between the switch to the 300 g q4w 
regimen and first PK sampling after it was 4 weeks in 3 cases. All other patients switched 8 weeks 
(N=5) or longer prior to the next scheduled PK sampling. Thus, some of the samples are not collected 
under steady-state conditions. However, this was recognized by the applicant as the observed 
Ctrough,ss was calculated from samples in a steady-state only. Moreover, an external validation has 
been provided by the MAH and VPC plots indicate that all the observed concentrations were within in 
the prediction range [5th-95th] percentiles. 
ADME 
Population PK model estimates for SC bioavailability and absorption rate constant were comparable 
between adults/adolescents and children 6 to < 12 years of age with asthma. 
The absorption rate constant in children (6-11 years) with AD was about 2-fold as high (0.641/day) 
than that in the same age group of children with asthma (0.252/day). The difference in absorption rate 
constant between both paediatric populations was discussed. The absorption rate constants were 
comparable between children and adolescents/adults with asthma, as it was described differently for 
the AD population that the estimated rate of absorption in children ≥6 to <12 years of age was higher 
Assessment report  
EMA/98744/2022  
Page 24/88 
 
 
 
than in adults and that was consistent with the higher reported absorption rates in children (Robbie, 
2012). It is agreed that the 2-fold difference in absorption rate between children 6 to <12 years of age 
with AD and asthma is expected to result in no clinically relevant impact on steady-state trough 
concentrations and in a small effect on steady-state maximum concentrations. 
Dupilumab distributes primarily within the vascular compartment. Model-estimated volume of 
distribution at steady state (Vss) in children 6 to <12 years of age is 3.7 L.as reflected in the section 
5.2 of the SmPC. 
The measure of variability of V2, and of the derived PK Parameters CL (0.133 L/day), Q (0.209 L/day), 
V3 (1.39 L) and Vss (3.74 L) were provided.  
The derived linear clearance (CL), based on normalization by the median weight of the respective age 
group (adults, adolescent, children with asthma 6 to <12 years) increases with age as the CL is 
correlated to body weight in the popPK analyses and body weight increases with the age.    
PK in the target population 
In contrast to all other age groups and indications, no loading dose has been foreseen. In 
consequence, time to steady-state is indicated to be prolonged for paediatric patients with asthma (6-
12 years of age). A discussion of loading dose or, in other words time to steady state with respect to 
efficacy was considered to be needed given that treatment of “severe” status of disease is indicated. 
The MAH’s reasoning for not considering a loading dose in EFC14153 can be followed and is supported. 
A rapid onset of action across several efficacy endpoints and in type 2 biomarkers are indicated when 
no load dose was given supporting that the differences that might be observed with or without loading 
dose are deemed not clinically relevant. 
Pop PK analysis 
The final pop PK dataset contained 1772 dupilumab concentrations from 377 children 6 to <12 years of 
age with asthma with a body weight range of 16.4 kg to 67.2 kg. In the final dataset, PK data following 
300 mg q4w dose was very limited (N=2 patients in weight group of ≤30 kg, one from dupilumab 
treatment group and the other from placebo group of study EFC14153), which resulted in only two PK 
samples. The applicant provided an update using PK data following 300 mg q4w including external 
validation of the pop PK model. The updated data set comprises a total of 36 post-300 mg q4w 
treatment concentration data of dupilumab collected from 17 out of 18 patients 6 to <12 years of age 
exposed to dupilumab 300 mg q4w in Study LTS14424 by the PK data cut-off date of 26 May 2021. 7 
post-dose samples that had dupilumab were classified below limit of quantification (BLQ). One patient 
was excluded from the Pop PK analysis, as dupilumab concentrations in all PK samples (collected at 
Week 52 and at Week 64) were BLQ. Thus the PK analysis dataset for 300 mg q4w regimen from 
Study LTS14424 contained 29 dupilumab concentrations from 16 children 6 to <12 years of age with 
asthma. 
Observed trough concentrations following 300 mg q4w in LTS14424 showed that the 300 mg q4w (≤30 
kg) dose regimen achieved dupilumab exposure similar to that for 200 mg q2w (≥30 kg) dose regimen 
in children 6 to <12 years of age with asthma. The requested external validation has been provided by 
the MAH. VPC plots indicate that all the observed concentrations were within in the prediction range 
[5th-95th] percentiles. 
Overall, model diagnostics indicate no major deviations or miss-specifications.  
All the fixed effect parameters and IIV terms estimated using final model estimates, were included in 
the 2.5th-97.5th interval calculated from the bootstrap. For the power coefficients of weight on Ke and 
V2, these intervals however are very broad. A sensitivity analysis, where the final Pop PK model was 
compared with a Pop PK model without considering weight effect on V2 and Ke. The results showed 
Assessment report  
EMA/98744/2022  
Page 25/88 
 
 
 
that inclusion of weight effect on V2 and Ke resulted in a reduction in inter-individual variability, from 
25.5% to 16.2% for V2 and from 34.6% to 25.4% for Ke. This is expected, as weight has been found 
as predictive covariate on PK for dupilumab and other mabs. However, as the pop PK model is used for 
exposure prediction regarding a paediatric subgroup, it is of importance to adequately include weight 
effects on PK.  
The applicant was also asked to provide a comparison of pop PK modelling using a 2 compartment 
model, assuming non-linear clearance and a parameterization with CL and V instead of Ke. Model 
performance and diagnostics should be compared assuming fix allometry (0.75 for CL, 1 for V), 
estimated allometric exponents, as well as with the selected final pop PK model.  To address the raised 
issue on pop PK model structure, the MAH provided a comparison of PK parameter estimates in 
different Pop PK models, including selected final asthma Pop PK model in children 6 to <12 years of 
age (Model 1), asthma Pop PK model using parameter CL instead of Ke (Model 3), and asthma Pop PK 
model using parameter CL and fixed allometry for CL and V2 (Model 4).  
Weight effects on Ke, CL, respectively and volumes of distribution were compared. As weight effect on 
Vmax was fixed, and scaling of V3 and Q was not considered and or not provided in the Table of 
parameter estimates, the comparison is expected to be biased. Nevertheless, estimated influence of 
weight on V2 is comparable, regardless of the way of model parameterization, and a prominent 
influence of weight on Clearance (CL, Ke) is indicated in the data (1772 concentrations from 377 
patients) used for building the model over a wide weight range (16.4-67.2 kg), as reflected in the 
estimated allometric exponents.  
It is agreed, that the primary conclusions from the model would be similar, regardless of the way of 
model parameterization. 
No significant bias in fit when examined across the predicted concentration range and the time after 
dose could be detected from GOF plots. Nevertheless, PK data is indicated to be highly variably.  
The results of the VPC showed that a large majority of the observed concentrations were within in the 
prediction range [5th-95th percentiles] and a few concentration points outside of the percentile range 
appeared to distribute evenly on either side. The applicant was asked to provide VPC plots stratified by 
dosing regimens which were provided accordingly. A large majority of the observed concentrations 
were within the prediction range [5th-95th percentiles] for both dosing regimens. 
BLQ data: The applicant was asked to state the number of <LLOQ data and respective % of total 
number of PK samples per dose. The exclusion of <LLOQ samples while using the pop PK model for the 
300 mg Q4W regimen was acknowledged. An even greater range in exposure and potential increase in 
<LLOQ samples for paediatric patients at higher weight due to the extended dosing interval was 
expected. However, given the lack of influence of exclusion of BLQ values on PK parameter estimates 
and a similar percentage of BLQ values in children across dose regimens and across AD and asthma 
populations, no meaningful impact is expected on the predicted 300 mg q4w PK exposures with the 
final selected Pop PK model in children 6 to <12 years of age with asthma. 
The number of BLQ values has been provided. There were 465 (267 pre-first dose and 198 post-first 
dose) out of 2250 concentrations (20.7%) in the dataset from the two clinical studies EFC14153 
(completed) and LTS14424 (PK cut-off date of 18 August 2020) used for Pop PK model development in 
children 6 to <12 years of age with asthma. Out of these BLQ data, 120 and 345 records were from 
100 mg q2w and 200 mg q2w regimens, respectively. For these data, M3 likelihood-based method was 
used to evaluate the influence of excluding BLQ observations on final Pop PK model performance and 
the results revealed that there were no appreciable changes in parameter estimates. The use of this 
method is supported. 
Assessment report  
EMA/98744/2022  
Page 26/88 
 
 
 
For the 300 mg q4w regimen, the percentage of BLQ values was 21.1% (124/588 samples), which is 
deemed comparable with 22.0% (67/305 samples), 21.0% (60/286 samples), as observed for the 
dosing regimens 100 mg q2w (<30 kg) and 200 mg q2w (≥30 kg); as well as with the 6-<12 years of 
age population with asthma (% BLQ: 19.4% following 300 mg q4w, Study LTS14424). 
Special populations 
Prominent impact of weight on PK parameters (linear, non-linear clearance and volume of distribution) 
and consequently on exposure in each weight category (15-30 kg, 30-60 kg) was observed.  
Weight effect on steady-state exposure was presented for 100 mg q2w and 200 mg q2w regimens 
considering median weight, and p5 and p95 weight percentiles. The applicant was asked to 
complement with expected exposure following 300 mg q4w for both weight categories, which has been 
provided accordingly.  
Pharmacodynamics 
Dupilumab has been shown to consistently induce a rapid and sustained reduction in FeNO and TARC, 
as well as a progressive reduction of total IgE. 
Post-treatment biomarker data were limited to only a small number of patients of study EFC14153, as 
most participants switched to the LTS14424 study and were only reported for FeNO. A sustained effect 
on FeNO levels after dupilumab treatment discontinuation was not observed.  
Immunogenicity 
The ADA response in children with asthma was low and consistent with that observed in children with 
AD of the same age group and at the same dupilumab dose. It was further consistent across age 
groups in patients with asthma. 
Moreover, immunogenicity data across all dosing regimens were in general similar.  
PK/PD and exposure-response 
The relationship between pre-bronchodilator FEV1pp (change from baseline at Week 12) and functional 
dupilumab Ctrough at Week 12, and the exposure-response relationships between severe exacerbation 
(annualized event rate) and average concentration (C average) over the event observation period, 
were best described by a log-linear model. 
Results indicate the trend in lower predicted range in effect. Observed variability in results in terms of 
95% CI is larger.  
No definite exposure-response relationship with respect to safety was provided. Given the acceptable 
safety profile and exposure predicted to be lower than that at the highest dose tested (300 mg qw in 
adults), this is acceptable. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Phase 3 PK data are deemed sufficient to characterize the pharmacokinetics following 100 mg q2w and 
200 mg q2w of dupilumab in the proposed indication.  
A pop PK analysis was conducted using pooled data from the Phase 3 studies in children 6 to <12 
years of age with asthma to characterize dupilumab PK, compare exposure between indication (Asthma 
vs AD) and across age groups, and assess the influence of extrinsic and intrinsic factors on dupilumab 
PK variability. In addition, this model was used to simulate dupilumab concentrations over time for the 
Assessment report  
EMA/98744/2022  
Page 27/88 
 
 
 
alternative regimen of 300 mg q4w in children 6 to <12 years of age with asthma, for which PK data 
were very few (N=2 subjects and PK samples in total). 
Overall, model diagnostics indicate no mayor deviations or miss-specifications. Nevertheless, PK data is 
indicated to be highly variably. 
With regard to pharmacodynamics, the treatment effect of dupilumab has been shown on type 2 
inflammation biomarkers serum IgE, serum TARC, and the FeNO. This is supported by PK/PD and E-R 
analyses in terms of reduction in severe exacerbation rate and improvement in percent predicted FEV1 
change from baseline for both the 100 mg q2w and 200 mg q2w dose regimens in children 6 to <12 
years of age with asthma. 
Off-treatment results for FeNO revealed no sustained effect of dupilumab on this type 2 biomarker.  
With regard to immunogenicity, the ADA response in children with asthma was low and consistent with 
that observed in children with AD of the same age group and at the same dupilumab dose. It was 
further consistent across age groups in patients with asthma. Moreover, immunogenicity data across 
all dosing regimens were in general similar. 
The  clinical  pharmacology  properties  are  considered  sufficiently  characterised and  reflected  in  section 
5.2. of the SmPC.

vaccines: any vaccination for tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis and/or seasonal trivalent/quadrivalent 
influenza vaccine.  
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was the annualized rate of severe exacerbation events during the 52-week 
treatment period. 
A severe exacerbation event was defined as a deterioration of asthma requiring: 
-Use of SCS for ≥3 days; or, 
-Hospitalization or emergency room visit because of asthma, requiring SCS. 
Two events were considered as different if the interval between their start dates was ≥28 days. 
The annualized rate of severe exacerbation events during the 52-week treatment period was 
defined as the number of severe exacerbation events with onset during the 52-week treatment 
period per patient-year. 
The key secondary endpoint was the change from baseline in percent predicted pre-BD FEV1 at 
Week 12. 
Other secondary endpoints were as follows:

•  Sample size 
Overall 402 patients were planned to be randomized in a 2:1 allocation to dupilumab versus 
placebo. The sample size is powered for the primary endpoint of annualized rate of severe 
exacerbations over 52 weeks for 3 populations of interest (patients with baseline blood 
eosinophils ≥0.3 Giga/L, patients with baseline blood eosinophils ≥0.15 Giga/L, and Type 2 
inflammatory asthma phenotype populations) tested in a hierarchical testing approach. The power 
calculation bases on the assumption that the number of severe exacerbations follow a negative 
binomial distribution. 
With a 2-sided 5% significance level, the study can fulfil the following power considerations: 
- 
- 
- 
Patients with Type 2 inflammatory asthma phenotype: assuming a placebo annualized severe 
exacerbation rate of 0.7, and a dispersion parameter of 1.5, with approximately 345 patients 
randomized (230 for dupilumab and 115 for matching placebo group), the study had 
approximately 94% power to detect a 54% relative risk reduction (ie, annualized rate of 0.322 
for the dupilumab group) in the annualized rate of severe exacerbations at the 2-tailed 
significance level of α=0.05 among these patients. 
Patients with baseline blood eosinophils ≥0.3 Giga/L: Assuming a placebo annualized severe 
exacerbation rate of 0.8 and a dispersion parameter of 1.5, with approximately 255 patients 
randomized (170 for dupilumab and 85 for matching placebo group), the study had 
approximately 96% power to detect a 60% relative risk reduction (ie, annualized rate of 0.32 
for the dupilumab group) in the annualized rate of severe exacerbations at the 2-tailed 
significance level of α=0.05 among these patients. 
Patients with baseline blood eosinophils ≥0.15 Giga/L: Aassuming a placebo annualized severe 
exacerbation rate of 0.7, and a dispersion parameter of 1.5, with approximately 327 patients 
randomized (218 for dupilumab and 109 for matching placebo group), the study will have 
approximately 93% power to detect a 54% relative risk reduction (ie, annualized rate of 0.322 
for the dupilumab group) in the annualized rate of severe exacerbations at the 2-tailed 
significance level of α=0.05 among these patients. 
The sample size calculation assumes a linear discontinuation rate (20% at 1 year), thus the 
average exposure duration for patients is 0.9 year. The assumed relative risk reductions are based 
on the results in the Phase 3 asthma study EFC13579 (QUEST). 
To achieve target sample size for each of the populations stated above, at least a total of 402 
patients in the overall population (268 for dupilumab and 134 for placebo) needed to be 
randomized assuming approximately 86% of the randomized patients had the Type 2 inflammatory

asthma phenotype baseline blood eosinophils ≥0.15 Giga/L or baseline FeNO ≥20 ppb), 
approximately 81% of the randomized patients had the baseline blood eosinophils ≥0.15 Giga/L, 
and approximately 64% of the randomized patients had the baseline blood eosinophils ≥0.3 Giga/L. 
•  Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
Randomization 
Patients were planned to be randomized in a 2:1 randomisation ratio for dupilumab and placebo, 
stratified by ICS dose level at screening (medium, high), eosinophil count at screening (<0.3/≥0.3 
Giga/L), and regions (Latin America vs. Eastern Europe vs. Western Countries). Randomisation 
was conducted centrally via an Interactive Voice Response System/Interactive Web Response 
system (IVRS/IWRS). This was a double-blind study. Both investigator and patients were 
unblended to the dose level of dupilumab 200mg/matching placebo or dupilumab 100mg/matching 
placebo due to different volume (1.14 mL vs. 0.67 mL). 
Blinding (masking) 
In case of an AE, the code was only planned to be broken in circumstances when knowledge of the IMP 
is required for treating the patient. Only investigators (at site level) may break the blind in an 
emergency unblinding transaction, no one on the study level. 
•  Statistical methods

•  Baseline data 
Demographics and patient characteristics 
Demographics and patient characteristics at baseline were balanced among the treatment groups 
and were similar across all 4 populations identified by baseline type 2 biomarkers, as well as the 
ITT population. In the population with type 2 inflammatory asthma phenotype, the mean 
(standard deviation [SD]) age of the patients was 8.9 (1.6) years, 65.7% were males, and the 
majority of patients (88.6%) were Caucasian/White. There were 32.0% of patients with weight 
≤30 kg and 68.0% of patients with weight >30 kg at baseline. 
In the population with baseline blood eosinophil ≥0.3 Giga/L, the mean (SD) age of the patients 
was 9.0 (1.6) years, 67.2% were males, and the majority of patients (87.3%) were 
Caucasian/White. There were 32.4% of patients with weight ≤30 kg and 67.6% of patients with 
weight >30 kg at baseline.  
Disease characteristics at baseline 
The disease characteristics for the other populations defined by type 2 inflammatory 
biomarkers as well as the ITT population (cf. CSR) were overall similar to the primary 
populations. 
Assessment report  
EMA/98744/2022

In the type 2 inflammatory asthma phenotype population, baseline disease characteristics were 
well balanced between treatment arms. The mean (SD) age at onset of asthma was 3.4 (2.6) 
years. At baseline, 43.4% of patients were on high dose ICS, 55.7% were on medium dose ICS 
(plus 1 additional controller), and 0.9% of patients were on low dose ICS (in violation of the 
protocol). The mean number of severe asthma exacerbations in the prior year was 2.47. The 
mean pre-BD FEV1 was 1.49 L and the mean percent predicted pre-BD FEV1 was 77.89%, with 
50.0% of patients having a percent predicted pre-BD FEV1 <80%. The mean baseline FEV1 
reversibility was 19.61% in the population overall and numerically greater in the dupilumab 
group compared to the placebo group (21.47% versus 15.81%). The enrolled population had 
evidence of uncontrolled asthma including a mean ACQ-7-IA total score of 2.14 . The majority 
of patients (94.0%) reported having an ongoing comorbid atopic disease, including 82.6% with 
allergic rhinitis and 38.9% with atopic dermatitis. The baseline disease characteristics were 
similar in the populations defined by baseline blood eosinophil ≥0.3 Giga/L. 
Baseline biomarkers 
In the population with the type 2 inflammatory asthma phenotype, the mean baseline level of 
biomarkers, including blood eosinophils, serum total IgE, serum thymus and activation-
regulated chemokine (TARC), and FeNO, were balanced between treatment groups and were 
elevated. The mean eosinophil count at baseline was 0.57 Giga/L (median: 0.49 Giga/L), the 
mean FeNO was 30.71 ppb (median: 24 ppb), and the mean serum total IgE at baseline was 
905.52 IU/mL (median: 483.00 IU/mL). 
Overall, 259 (74.0%) patients had baseline eosinophil counts ≥0.3 Giga/L, 331 (94.6%) 
patients had baseline eosinophil counts ≥0.15 Giga/L, and 203 (58.0%) patients had baseline 
FeNO ≥20 ppb.  
In the population with baseline blood eosinophils ≥0.3 Giga/L, the baseline type 2 
inflammatory biomarkers were as expected numerically higher than the population with the 
type 2 inflammatory asthma phenotype. The mean eosinophil count at baseline was 0.71 
Giga/L (median:0.62 Giga/L), the mean FeNO was 33.50 ppb (median: 27 ppb), and the mean 
serum total IgE at baseline was 1077.00 IU/mL (median: 586.00 IU/mL). Overall, 166 (64.1%) 
patients had baseline FeNO ≥20 ppb. 
Background medication 
All patients were receiving background asthma controller therapy at stable doses at study 
entry and continued with these medications throughout the study.  
In the population with the type 2 inflammatory asthma phenotype, there were 43.4% of 
patients on high-dose ICS and 55.7% were on medium-dose ICS.  
In the population with baseline blood eosinophils ≥0.3 Giga/L, there were 44.4% of patients 
on high-dose ICS and 54.4% on medium-dose ICS. Most of the patients (84.9% and 83.8.% in 
the populations with the type 2 inflammatory asthma phenotype and with baseline blood 
eosinophils ≥0.3 Giga/L, respectively) received ICS in combination with LABA, a small number 
of patients received high dose ICS alone (2.6% and 2.3%, respectively).   
•  Numbers analysed 
The 2 primary efficacy populations consisted of the population with the type 2 inflammatory 
asthma phenotype, which was comprised of 350 patients and accounted for 85.8% of the ITT 
population, and the population with baseline blood eosinophils ≥0.3 Giga/L, which was 
comprised of 259 patients and accounted for 63.5% of the ITT population. The 2 other efficacy 
populations of interest consisted of the population with baseline blood eosinophils ≥0.15 
Giga/L, which was comprised of 331 patients and accounted for 81.1% of the ITT population, 
and the population with baseline FeNO ≥20 ppb, which was comprised of 203 patients and 
accounted for 49.8% of the ITT population. In the population with baseline FeNO ≥20 ppb, the

majority of patients (184 [90.6%]) had baseline blood eosinophils ≥0.15 Giga/L and 19 (9.4%) 
had baseline blood eosinophils <0.15 Giga/L. The population with baseline blood eosinophils 
≥0.3 Giga/L accounted for 74.0% of the type 2  inflammatory asthma phenotype population. 
The population with baseline blood eosinophils≥0.15 Giga/L accounted for the majority 
(94.6%) of the type 2 inflammatory asthma phenotype population, and the population with 
baseline FeNO ≥20 ppb constituted 58.0% of the type 2 inflammatory asthma phenotype 
population. 
•  Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoint - Annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbation events 
In the population with the type 2 inflammatory asthma phenotype, the adjusted annualized rate 
of severe asthma exacerbation events during the 52-week treatment period was lower in the 
dupilumab group compared with placebo group (0.305 and 0.748, respectively). The relative risk 
reduction versus placebo was 59.3% (p <0.0001). The percentage of patients who remained free 
of severe asthma exacerbation events during the 52-week treatment period was greater for 
patients in the dupilumab group in comparison with the placebo group (77.1% and 59.6%, 
respectively). Among the patients who had at least one severe asthma exacerbation, a lower 
percentage of patients in the dupilumab group had multiple exacerbations compared with the 
placebo group. 
In the population with baseline blood eosinophils ≥0.3 Giga/L, the adjusted annualized rate of 
severe asthma exacerbation events during the 52-week treatment period was lower in the 
dupilumab group compared with placebo group (0.235 and 0.665, respectively). The relative risk 
reduction versus placebo was 64.7% (p <0.0001). The percentage of patients who remained free 
of severe asthma exacerbation events during the 52-week treatment period was greater for 
patients in the dupilumab group in comparison with the placebo group (78.9% and 58.3%, 
respectively). Among the patients who had at least one severe asthma exacerbation, a lower 
percentage of patients in the dupilumab group had multiple exacerbations compared with the 
placebo group. 
This same pattern was observed in populations identified on the basis of individual markers of 
type 2 inflammation. 
The relative risk in annualized rate of severe exacerbation events during the 52-week treatment 
is shown for all 5 efficacy populations in Figure 1.

Key secondary efficacy endpoint - Change from baseline in percent predicted pre-bronchodilator FEV1 
at Week 12 
In the population with the type 2 inflammatory asthma phenotype, the least square (LS) mean change 
from baseline in percent predicted pre-BD FEV1 at Week 12 was 10.53% in the dupilumab group 
versus 5.32% in the placebo group; the difference was statistically significant (5.21%, [95% CI:2.14, 
8.27%], p=0.0009) (Figure 2). The least square (LS) mean change in percent predicted pre-BD FEV1 
from baseline to Week 52 was 12.15% in the dupilumab group and 4.36% in the placebo group, 
resulting in an LS mean difference versus placebo of 7.79% (nominal p <0.0001). 
In the population with baseline blood eosinophils ≥0.3 Giga/L, the LS mean change from baseline in 
percent predicted pre-BD FEV1 at Week 12 was 10.15% in the dupilumab group versus 4.83% in the 
placebo group; the difference was statistically significant (5.32%, [95% CI: 1.76, 8.88%], p=0.0036) 
(Figure 2). The LS mean change in percent predicted pre-BD FEV1 from baseline to Week 52 was 
12.43% in the dupilumab group and 4.08% in the placebo group, resulting in an LS mean difference 
versus placebo of 8.35% (nominal p=0.0001). 
In contrast, in the population with both baseline blood eosinophils <0.15 Giga/L and baseline 
FeNO <20 ppb, the LS mean difference between dupilumab versus placebo in percent predicted pre-BD 
FEV1 at Week 12 was not clinically meaningful (1.38% [95% CI: -6.13, 8.90]) (Figure 2). 
Type 2 inflammatory asthma phenotype population is defined as the randomized patients with baseline blood 
eosinophils >= 0.15 Giga/L or baseline FeNO >= 20 ppb.

Supportive analyses to key secondary endpoint: Other lung function measurements 
Further parameters that were analysed regarding the treatment effect on lung function were the mean 
(SD) baseline absolute pre-BD FEV1 (L), percent predicted post-BD FEV1, in forced vital capacity 
(FVC); and in forced expiratory flow (FEF) 25-75%.

During treatment period, pre-BD FEV1 (L) of patients with type 2 inflammatory asthma phenotype 
improved with an LS mean change from baseline at Week 12 of 0.22 L in the dupilumab group and 
0.12 L in the placebo group, and an LS mean difference versus placebo of 0.10 L ([95% CI: 0.04, 
0.16], nominal p=0.0012). The treatment effect was sustained over the 52-week treatment period, 
with an LS mean difference versus placebo at Week 52 of 0.17 L ([95% CI: 0.09, 0.24], nominal 
<0.0001). 
In the population with baseline blood eosinophils ≥0.3 Giga/L, the LS mean change from baseline at 
Week 12 was 0.22 L in the dupilumab group and 0.12 L in the placebo group, with an LS mean 
difference versus placebo of 0.10 L ([95% CI: 0.03, 0.17], nominal p=0.0042). The treatment effect 
was sustained over the 52-week treatment period, with an LS mean difference versus placebo at Week 
52 of 0.17 L ([95% CI: 0.09, 0.26], nominal p=0.0001). 
Improvements in predicted post-BD FEV1, forced vital capacity (FVC), and in forced expiratory flow 
(FEF) 25-75% (see. Fig. 4, 5) were observed in both primary efficacy populations. 
There was no difference versus placebo for the endpoint of change from baseline in FVC across these 
populations, nor for morning or evening peak expiratory flow (PEF) over time.

Efficacy within subgroups defined by baseline ICS dose 
Among the patients treated with high-dose ICS at baseline, dupilumab led to a 63.3% (p=0.0004) and 
64.0% (p=0.0019) reduction compared to placebo at Week 52 in the annualized rate of severe asthma 
exacerbation events for the population with type 2 inflammatory asthma phenotype and the population 
with baseline blood eosinophils ≥0.3 Giga/L, respectively (Figure 5). A similar magnitude of reduction 
in severe asthma exacerbations was observed for the populations with baseline blood eosinophils 
≥0.15 Giga/L, the population with baseline FeNO ≥20 ppb, and the ITT population. Among the patients 
treated with medium-dose ICS at baseline, dupilumab led to a 59.5% (nominal p=0.0025) and 65.8% 
(nominal p=0.0021) reduction compared to placebo at Week 52 in the annualized rate of severe 
asthma exacerbation events for the population with type 2 inflammatory asthma phenotype and the 
population with baseline blood eosinophils ≥0.3 Giga/L, respectively (Figure 5).

Effect on percent predicted pre-bronchodilator FEV1 in patients on high- or medium-dose 
ICS at baseline 
Among the high-dose ICS subgroups, the percent predicted pre-BD FEV1 in the dupilumab and placebo 
groups improved over time, and the dupilumab group had a numerically greater improvement in lung 
function, but this was not significantly different between the dupilumab group compared to the placebo 
group at Week 12. Among patients in the type 2 inflammatory asthma phenotype population on high-
dose ICS at baseline, dupilumab led to an LS mean difference versus placebo of 2.47% (nominal 
p=0.3152) in the percent predicted pre-BD FEV1 at Week 12, and of 5.70% (nominal p=0.0180) at 
Week 52. In the population with baseline blood eosinophil ≥0.3 Giga/L dupilumab led to an LS mean 
difference versus placebo of 3.02% (nominal p=0.2843) in the percent predicted pre-BD FEV1 at Week 
12, and of 6.48% (nominal p=0.0203) at Week 52. 
In the medium-dose ICS subgroup, there was a nominally significant and clinically meaningful 
improvement in the percent predicted pre-BD FEV1 in the dupilumab groups compared to placebo. For 
the population with the type 2 inflammatory asthma phenotype, the LS mean difference in the percent 
predicted pre-BD FEV1 versus placebo at Week 12 was 7.19% (nominal p=0.0006). For the population 
with baseline blood eosinophil ≥0.3 Giga/L, the LS mean difference in the percent predicted pre-BD 
FEV1 versus placebo at Week 12 was 6.73% (nominal p=0.0064) (Figure 6).

 Subgroup analyses based on markers of Type 2 inflammation 
In order to evaluate the independent role of either biomarker to appropriately select patients aged 6 to 
<12 years old that would respond to dupilumab, additional subgroup analyses were performed. 
Biomarker subgroup analysis 
To further support the ability of either blood eosinophils or FeNO to identify dupilumab responders in a 
reliable and independent manner, the following analyses were performed:  
• Prespecified biomarker subgroup analyses, to evaluate the response within categories of baseline 
biomarker level  
• Prespecified treatment-by-biomarker interaction testing, to evaluate the strength of the statistical 
evidence supporting the independent role of individual baseline biomarker level for the observed 
differences in treatment effect 
• Prespecified quadrant analyses, to descriptively demonstrate that elevated biomarkers of type 2 
inflammation as measured by either elevated blood eosinophils and/or FeNO predict efficacy 
• Post-hoc penalized spline regression model analysis to explore the association between exacerbations 
or percent predicted pre-BD FEV1 and continuous baseline biomarker level in dupilumab and placebo 
arms  
• Post-hoc evaluation of the correlation of blood eosinophils or FeNO over time in the placebo-exposed 
population to explore the stability of these biomarkers in a population with moderate-to-severe asthma 
Treatment effect by baseline type 2 biomarkers 
The effect of dupilumab on the annualized rate of severe exacerbation events and on the change from 
baseline in percent predicted pre-BD FEV1 at Week 12 was analyzed in the ITT population across 
subgroups defined by baseline type 2 biomarker level, including blood eosinophils (<0.15 Giga/L, 
≥0.15-0.3 Giga/L, ≥0.3-0.5 Giga/L, and ≥0.5 Giga/L) and FeNO (<20 ppb and ≥20 ppb). Baseline

levels of blood eosinophils or FeNO independently predicted the magnitude of response to dupilumab 
for both exacerbation reduction and lung function improvement.  
For exacerbation reduction, subgroup analyses by baseline blood eosinophils showed a clinically 
meaningful exacerbation reduction compared to placebo for all subgroups with baseline blood 
eosinophils ≥0.15 Giga/L and for both subgroups defined by baseline FeNO. The magnitude of 
response increased with increasing baseline blood eosinophil or FeNO level. There was no meaningful 
treatment effect in annualized rate of severe exacerbation events for the subgroup with baseline blood 
eosinophils <0.15 Giga/L. The efficacy observed in the population with baseline FeNO <20 ppb was 
likely driven by patients with baseline eosinophils ≥0.15 Giga/L, which, because of the recruitment cap 
on patients with blood eosinophils <0.15 Giga/L, accounted for 90.6% of patients in the FeNO <20 ppb 
subgroup. 
For lung function improvement, dupilumab showed a consistent improvement in the percent predicted 
pre-BD FEV1 compared to placebo across all subgroups defined by baseline blood eosinophils, with the 
greatest magnitude of effect observed in patients with baseline blood eosinophils ≥0.5 Giga/L. There 
was a nominally significant improvement in lung function for the population with baseline FeNO ≥20 
ppb, and no meaningful change observed in the population with baseline FeNO <20 ppb (see Figure 7 
and Figure 8).

Summary of efficacy by type 2 biomarkers   
Taken together, this set of analyses support the role of blood eosinophils and FeNO as independent 
patient selection biomarkers. Subgroup analyses demonstrate a greater magnitude of response in 
subgroups defined by baseline biomarker, with no meaningful exacerbation reduction observed in the 
population with baseline blood eosinophils <0.15 Giga/L. Despite the fact that enrollment in the 
paediatric population limited the proportion of patients with baseline eosinophils <0.15 Giga/L, FeNO 
thresholds were still able to identify subgroups with greater response to dupilumab. Interaction testing 
supports the independence of these biomarkers, even adjusting for baseline biomarker and treatment-
by-biomarker interactions, and the independent predictive ability of these biomarkers is further 
supported by quadrant analyses that show similar treatment effects across populations identified by 
either baseline blood eosinophils ≥0.15 Giga/L or FeNO ≥20 ppb or both, and minimal treatment 
effect in populations with baseline blood eosinophils <0.15 Giga/L and FeNO <20 ppb. This concept, 
further visualized by spline models, showed that baseline blood eosinophils and FeNO independently 
predict the response to treatment. Finally, blood eosinophils and FeNO are demonstrated to be stable 
biomarkers in this population, with potentially greater stability demonstrated for FeNO compared to 
blood eosinophils.  
Taken together, these data support the findings from the primary analysis showing significant and 
clinically meaningful treatment effects in populations defined by either blood eosinophils ≥0.15 Giga/L 
or FeNO ≥20 ppb.  
•  Ancillary analyses 
Analyses of any association between ADA and efficacy 
The relationship between anti-drug antibodies (ADA) and clinical response (annualized rate of severe 
exacerbation events and change from baseline in pre-BD FEV1) was investigated in patients with 
treatment-emergent ADA responses.   
As exacerbations are a highly variable endpoint, evaluation of the association between ADA and the 
annualized rate of severe exacerbations did not yield meaningful results. 
The evaluation of the association of a treatment-emergent ADA response with the change in percent 
predicted pre-BD FEV1 at Week 12 is based on a small population (17 patients in the dupilumab group 
and 4 patients in the placebo group). As a result, there is limited data for comparison.   
In the dupilumab group, mean changes from baseline in percent predicted pre-BD FEV1 to Week 12 
were 12.29% for the ADA-positive patients (N=17) and 10.09% for the ADA-negative patients 
(N=248). The individual profiles of percent predicted pre-BD FEV1 in ADA-positive patients were 
generally within the range observed in ADA-negative patients. 
Analysis of clinical information relevant to dosing recommendations 
Supportive efficacy data include  
The recommended dose for paediatric patients with asthma age 6 to <12 years old is:  
• 
• 
• 
For patients with body weight ≥15 to <30kg: 100 mg q2w or 300 mg q4w;  
For patients with body weight ≥30kg to <60 kg: 200 mg q2w or 300 mg q4w;  
For patients with body weight ≥60 kg: 200 mg q2w.   
The results of the Phase 3 studies, along with supporting PK and exposure-response analyses, 
provide the basis for the proposed dosing regimens in children 6 to <12 years of age with

uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma. The 100 mg q2w and 200 mg q2w regimen is supported 
by observed clinical efficacy and safety. The 300 mg q4w dose is supported by population 
pharmacokinetic (Pop PK) and exposure-response analyses in children 6 to <12 years of age with 
asthma, and PK, PK/PD relationships, safety profile in adult and adolescent with asthma, as well as 
the acceptable safety profile for this dose regimen in children 6 to <12 years of age with AD. The 
300 mg q4w dose regimen has been shown to have an acceptable safety and efficacy profile in the 
AD paediatric (6 to <12 year old) population and is included in the approved posology for AD.  
The choice of dose options in a given weight category provides flexibility for the provider and patient, 
and includes an option that can reduce patient burden by reducing the frequency of injections while 
also providing improved consistency with AD dosing for same age/weight, which is desirable due to 
the high co-morbid occurrence of these conditions.  
To support simplification of dosing across indications, the proposed weight threshold has been 
slightly adjusted from the threshold used in Study EFC14153, to be consistent with the approved 
posology for AD. The weight cut-offs of the proposed regimens differ from what was studied in the 
pivotal Study EFC14153. A minor change in the body weight cut-off (≥15 kg to <30 kg instead of 
≥16 kg to ≤30 kg) is proposed to be consistent with the approved posology for the AD paediatric 
population. This update is supported by PK simulations that show there are no meaningful 
differences in steady state trough concentration when using the updated threshold compared to the 
threshold used in the clinical trials. This minor change is not anticipated to have any impact on 
efficacy or safety.  
Significant and clinically meaningful improvements were observed across multiple endpoints for 
both the 100 mg q2w dose regimen for children ≤30 kg and the 200 mg q2w dose regimen for 
children >30 kg, and the magnitude of responses were similar between weight/dose groups (see 
Figure 9). In the population with the type 2 inflammatory asthma phenotype, the relative risk 
versus placebo for adjusted annualized severe exacerbation event rate in the ≤30 kg subgroup and 
the >30 kg subgroup was 0.317 (95% CI: 0.157, 0.640) and 0.449 (95% CI: 0.278, 0.724), 
respectively. In the population with baseline blood eosinophils ≥0.3 Giga/L, the relative risk versus 
placebo for adjusted annualized severe exacerbation event rate in the ≤30 kg subgroup and the 
>30 kg subgroup was 0.344 (95% CI: 0.164 ,0.720) and 0.353 (95% CI: 0.196, 0.636), 
respectively. In the population with the type 2 inflammatory asthma phenotype, the percent 
predicted pre-BD FEV1 LS mean difference from placebo in the change from baseline to Week 12 in 
the ≤30 kg subgroup and the >30 kg subgroup was 6.52% (95% CI: 0.71, 12.33) and 4.47% 
(95% CI: 0.91, 8.03), respectively. In the population with baseline blood eosinophils ≥0.3 Giga/L, 
the LS mean difference in the ≤30 kg subgroup and the >30 kg subgroup was 7.94% (95% CI: 
1.01, 14.87) and 3.94% (95% CI: -0.24, 8.12), respectively.   
The introduction of the 300 mg q4w dose is supported by PK and PK/PD analyses and simulations in 
children 6 to <12 years of age and in adults and adolescents with asthma. Additional supportive data 
is provided by the descriptive efficacy of patients exposed to 300 mg q4w in Study LTS14424. This 
study included 14 patients aged 6 to <12 years with body weight ≤30 kg who were exposed to 300 
mg q4w for a total of 1.6 patient-years. Over the time period evaluated, these 14 patients 
experienced no severe asthma exacerbations and their lung function remained stable.  
In summary, the results from the paediatric asthma studies together with the PK and exposure 
response analysis support the recommended weight tiered doses for children age 6 to <12 years with 
uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma and evidence of type 2 inflammation: for children with body 
weight 15 to <30 kg, 100 mg q2w or 300 mg q4w; for children with body weight 30 kg to <60 kg, 200 
mg q2w or 300 mg q4w, and for children with body weight >60 kg, 200 mg q2w.

The Sponsor declares the analysis of primary and key secondary endpoints on 
populations with type 2 inflammatory asthma phenotype and with baseline 
blood eosinophil count ≥ 0.3 Giga/L as primary efficacy analysis. However, in 
the hierarchical testing procedure the population of patients with baseline 
blood eosinophils ≥ 0.15 Giga/L needed to be significant first in order to test 
the population of patients with baseline blood eosinophils ≥ 0.3 Giga/L. In this 
Table all results up to order 9 plus those for the ITT population are shown. As 
multiplicity is controlled by hierarchical testing, all p-values can be compared 
with a 5 % significance level. All hypotheses tests show significant results.  
Notes 
Table 3: Summary of efficacy results from the main studies 
Efficacy analysis performed across trials 
Study EFC13579 was a pivotal Phase 3 study that enrolled adults and adolescents with uncontrolled 
moderate-to-severe asthma without a minimum threshold for baseline blood eosinophil count or any 
other type 2 biomarkers. Efficacy was demonstrated in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma with 
type 2 inflammation, including patients with baseline blood eosinophils ≥0.15 Giga/L as part of the 
testing hierarchy, or patients with baseline FeNO ≥25 ppb in a prespecified analysis.   
The paediatric Study EFC14153 was designed to provide confirmatory evidence that both eosinophils 
and FeNO can identify patients with type 2 inflammation that respond to dupilumab. The approach to 
using data across both studies to support FeNO in both populations comes from the understanding that 
type 2 inflammation is present across all age groups with asthma. This is demonstrated below by a 
descriptive comparison of the clinical features and magnitude of response to dupilumab between both 
the paediatric and adult/adolescent populations with the type 2 inflammatory asthma phenotype.  
In addition to the primary efficacy evaluation, additional analyses were conducted to demonstrate the 
independent role and added value of FeNO as a patient selection biomarker, using the data from Study 
EFC14153. These analyses show 1) the primary efficacy results from Study EFC14153 confirm the 
observation in Study EFC13579, that in addition to blood eosinophil counts, FeNO is an appropriate 
predictive biomarker; and 2) the subgroup and interaction testing from Study EFC13579 strengthen 
the conclusion from the similar analyses for Study EFC14153: that FeNO is an independent predictive 
biomarker for dupilumab response that provides added value beyond eosinophils alone.

Treatment effect in the paediatric and adolescent/adult patient population 
Dupilumab reduced exacerbations in both the adult/adolescent and paediatric (aged 6 to <12 years) 
populations with the type 2 inflammatory asthma phenotype across both studies. The magnitude of 
effect was similar across both populations. In the adult/adolescent study, the exacerbation reduction 
was 54.2% and 57.7% in the 200 mg q2w and 300 mg q2w groups, respectively and this was 59.3% 
for the paediatric population. Similar patterns were observed across populations selected by individual 
markers of type 2 inflammation including baseline eosinophils alone (eosinophils ≥0.15 Giga/L or 
eosinophils ≥0.3 Giga/L) or by baseline FeNO alone (≥20 ppb in children and ≥25 ppb in adolescents 
and adults). 
Dupilumab improved lung function in both the adult/adolescent and paediatric (aged 6 to 12 years) 
populations with the type 2 inflammatory asthma phenotype across both studies. Despite the higher 
baseline mean percent predicted pre-BD FEV1 in the paediatric population, the magnitude of 
improvement was consistent across both populations. In the adult/adolescent study, the LS mean 
difference from placebo at Week 12 in percent predicted pre-BD FEV1 was 5.41% and 4.84% for the 
200 mg q2w and 300 mg q2w groups, respectively and this was 5.21% for the paediatric population. 
Similar patterns were observed for patients identified by baseline eosinophils alone (eosinophils ≥0.15 
Giga/L or eosinophils ≥0.3 Giga/L) or by baseline FeNO alone (≥20 ppb in children and ≥25 ppb in 
adolescents and adults). 
Supportive study LTS14424 (Open-label extension study) 
•  Study period 
Date first patient enrolled: 21 June 2018 (date of first signed informed consent)  
Date last patient completed: Ongoing study; cutoff date for interim analysis: 18 August 2020 
•  Study design 
Study LTS14424 is an ongoing open-label, single-arm, 1-year treatment study designed to evaluate 
the long-term safety and tolerability of dupilumab as well as its long term efficacy, pharmacokinetic 
(PK), and immunogenicity in paediatric patients 6 to <12 years of age in the parent Study EFC14153 
with asthma who participated in a previous dupilumab asthma study(EFC14153). The study consisted 
of 3 periods with a total duration of up to 64 weeks for each patient: enrollment visit, randomized 
treatment (52 weeks), and post-treatment follow-up (12 weeks). 
In Study LTS14424, patients were treated with dupilumab with dose level assigned based on body 
weight (100 mg q2w or 300 mg once every 4 weeks (q4w) after amended protocol 03 for children with 
weight ≤30 kg; 200 mg q2w for children with weight >30 kg), in combination with medium- or high-
dose ICS with a second controller or high-dose ICS alone (5.3.5.2 Study Reports of Uncontrolled 
Clinical Studies, Study LTS14424 [Section 8.2.1] and [Section 8.4.1]). Amended protocol 03 (12 
December 2019) introduced the dose of 300 mg q4w for children with body weight ≤30 kg, which 
replaced the 100 mg q2w dose for all patients with weight ≤30 kg with more than 8 weeks remaining 
in the study. This dose was introduced in order to be proposed as an alternative, convenient option, for 
less frequent dosing to decrease injection burden for children with moderate-to-severe asthma. 
Amendment 03 followed the results from the Atopic Dermatitis (AD) 6 to <12 years study (R668-AD-
1652) which evaluated both the 100 mg q2w and 300 mg 
q4w doses  for patients with body weight ≥15 to <30 kg. Both doses demonstrated clinical efficacy 
with an acceptable tolerability and safety profile. Given that the PK of dupilumab is similar across the 
diseases for which dupilumab is indicated (AD, asthma, CRSwNP), it was predicted that 300 mg q4w 
for children with body weight ≤30kg with asthma would also be safe and effective.

to the COVID-19 pandemic were allowed to enroll into Study LTS14424. 
•  Treatments 
Investigational medicinal product (IMP): dupilumab 
Formulation: Sterile dupilumab was supplied as a 150 mg/mL solution in pre-filled syringe to deliver 
a single 100 mg dose via a 0.67 mL injection or a 300 mg dose via a 2 mL injection, or as a 175 
mg/mL solution in pre-filled syringe to deliver a single dose of 200 mg via a 1.14 mL injection. 
Route of administration: Subcutaneous (SC)

protocol amendment 03, dated 12 December 2019) or 300 mg SC once every 4 weeks (q4w) (after 
protocol amendment 03). Patients with body weight >30 kg: 200 mg SC q2w. Of note: patients who 
started with or switched to 200 mg q2w continued the same dose regimen through the remaining 
treatment period irrespective of whether they remained >30 kg or not. 
Duration of treatment: 52 weeks 
Duration of observation: 64 weeks, including a 52-week treatment period and a 12-week follow-up 
period. 
•  Objectives 
Primary objective:  
•  To evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of dupilumab in paediatric patients with 
asthma who participated in a previous dupilumab asthma clinical study (EFC14153). 
Secondary objectives:

participated in a dupilumab in paediatric patients with asthma clinical study, 
•  To evaluate dupilumab in paediatric patients with asthma who participated in a previous 
dupilumab asthma clinical study with regard to systemic exposure, anti-drug antibodies 
(ADAs), and biomarkers. 
•  Outcome/endpoints 
Efficacy: 
-  Annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbation events during the treatment period.

Safety: The primary endpoint for this study was the number (n) and percentage (%) of patients 
experiencing any treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). 
Pharmacokinetics: Serum dupilumab concentrations and ADAs 
•  Statistical methods 
Analysis populations: 
The primary analysis population was the safety population, which was defined as all patients exposed 
to at least 1 dose or part of a dose of dupilumab during the LTS14424 study regardless of the amount 
of treatment administered. Enrolled patients for whom it was unclear whether or not they took the IMP 
were included in the safety population. The efficacy population was the same as the safety population 
in this study. 
The PK population consisted of all the patients in the safety population who had at least 1 non-missing 
and evaluable predose serum concentration value after the first dose of dupilumab in this study. 
The ADA population consisted of all the patients in the safety population with at least 1 non-missing 
result in the ADA assay following the first dose of dupilumab in this study.  
For each analysis population (safety, efficacy, PK, and ADA), the planned analyses were conducted in 
the following 2 analysis sets, respectively: 
- Full analysis set: all data observed in the study. The analyses performed on the full analysis set were 
to evaluate the long term safety, efficacy, PK, immunogenicity, and PD of all the dose regimens that 
were investigated in the LTS14424 study, ie, dupilumab 100 mg q2w and 300 mg q4w for patients ≤30 
kg and 200 mg q2w for patients >30 kg. 
- Modified analysis set: 1) For patients never exposed to 300 mg q4w: all observed data were 
included, 2) For patients who switched from 100 mg q2w to 300 mg q4w in LTS14424: data were 
included up to the date of first dose of 300 mg q4w with censoring data observed on and after this 
date, 3) If any patients initiated the study on 300 mg q4w (ie, received 300 mg q4w at Week 0), no 
data were to be included in this analysis set. The analyses performed on the modified analysis set were 
to focus on the long-term safety, efficacy, PK, immunogenicity, and PD of the same regimens as the 
parent study, ie, dupilumab 100 mg q2w and 200 mg q2w. 
Analyses: 
For each analysis set, the planned analyses are presented by the treatment categories according to the 
actual treatment group in the parent study EFC14153. 
Efficacy endpoints were all secondary endpoints in this study. All efficacy and safety analyses were 
descriptive and performed on the safety population for each analysis sets and presented by treatment 
category. 
Results 
Efficacy results: 
The results of this study support the long-term sustained efficacy of dupilumab, when added on top of 
medium or high dose ICS plus another controller or ICS alone, in children 6 to <12 years with 
moderate to-severe uncontrolled asthma. 
This report provides the results from the interim database lock for Study LTS14424, which includes 
data from 365 patients including 196 (53.7%) who had completed the 52-week treatment period. 
Patients treated with dupilumab for up to an additional year after the parent study demonstrated a low 
severe asthma exacerbation event rate and persistent improvement in lung function. These results 
were observed regardless of the treatment arm in the parent study. For those patients that rolled over 
from the placebo arm, there was a rapid onset of action, as demonstrated by the improvement in 
percent predicted FEV1 at Week 2. 
Patients treated long-term with dupilumab demonstrated a low rate of severe asthma exacerbations 
with an unadjusted annualized event rate in the overall population of 0.134. Consistent with the low

exacerbation rate, the majority of patients did not experience any exacerbations during the study. 
Among the 365 patients, 336 (92.1%) had no asthma exacerbations over a mean exposure to 
dupilumab of 283.8 days. This low rate of severe exacerbations was observed regardless of the 
treatment arm in the parent study (dupilumab-dupilumab or placebo-dupilumab). The majority of 
exacerbations were treated with systemic 
oral corticosteroids and only 1 patient required hospitalization or emergency room visit. 
The low exacerbation rate was observed in the full analysis set, as well as across multiple subgroups 
identified by markers of type 2 inflammation, including the two primary populations from the parent 
study, the type 2 inflammatory asthma phenotype (0.146) and the patients with baseline blood 
eosinophils ≥0.3 Giga/L (0.144). The unadjusted severe exacerbation rate was similarly low across 
patients selected by baseline eosinophils ≥0.15 Giga/L and FeNO ≥20 ppb. The exacerbation rate was 
also low among subgroups defined by the use of either high dose (0.178) or medium dose (0.105) ICS 
at baseline of the parent study. 
Dupilumab also demonstrated sustained improvement in lung function compared to the baseline of the 
parent study. There was a mean improvement in percent predicted FEV1 from baseline of +9.84% at 
Week 2 of this study, and this was maintained for the 52-week treatment period. The rapid onset in 
lung function improvement that was observed for dupilumab treated patients in the parent study was 
replicated for placebo-dupilumab patients in LTS14424. The mean change from baseline in this group 
was +3.64% at Week 0 and +7.89% at Week 2, and this was sustained over 52 weeks. The 
improvement in percent predicted FEV1 was observed in the full analysis set as well as across multiple 
subgroups identified by markers of type 2 inflammation, including the two primary populations from 
the parent study, the type 2 inflammatory 
phenotype (+10.21% at Week 2) and the patients with baseline blood eosinophils ≥0.3 Giga/L 
(+10.77% at Week 2). There was a similar improvement across patients selected by baseline 
eosinophils ≥0.15 Giga/L and FeNO ≥20 ppb. The sustained improvement in percent predicted FEV1 
was also observed among subgroups defined by the use of either high-dose ICS (+8.63% at Week 24) 
or medium-dose ICS (+10.16% at Week 24) at baseline of the parent study. There was also sustained 
improvement across other measures of lung function. The FEV1, FVC, and FEF25-75% continued to 
improve throughout the study. 
There were 14 patients that were exposed to the 300 mg q4w dose for a limited cumulative exposure 
of 1.6 patient-years as of the cutoff date for this report. Among these patients, no severe 
exacerbations were reported and the lung functions remained stable. 
As of the cut-off date of 25 June 2021, a total of 18 patients (8 in the placebo-dupilumab category and 
10 in the dupilumab-dupilumab category) had been exposed to dupilumab 300 mg q4w for a 
cumulative exposure of 10.5 patient-years (mean [SD] duration of exposure: 213.9 [104.5] days). 
There were no severe asthma exacerbations among the 18 patients that were exposed to 300 mg q4w 
dose regimen. Overall, the percent predicted FEV1 remained stable for these individual patients over 
the timepoints evaluated after the switch to the dupilumab 300 mg q4w regimen in LTS14424. 
In summary, this study supports the long-term sustained efficacy of dupilumab, both in the full 
analysis set as well as subgroups defined by markers of type 2 inflammation.

Immunogenicity results: 
The incidence of treatment-emergent positive ADA responses was low, reported in 3.8% of patients 
(7.3% in placebo-dupilumab category and 1.9% in dupilumab-dupilumab category) at the time of this 
report. Positive NAb responses were detected in 1.9% of patients. The majority of the positive ADA

responses had low to moderate ADA titers. Dupilumab exposure largely overlapped between patients 
with treatment-emergent positive ADA response and patients who were negative for ADA, except for 1 
patient with high titer ADA response. 
Among the limited number of patients with ADA positivity, no apparent associations between ADA 
positivity and PK, safety, or efficacy were observed. 
2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The main clinical trial conducted in support of this marketing authorisation application is the pivotal 
Phase 3 study EFC14153, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of dupilumab in children 6 to <12 years of age with uncontrolled 
persistent asthma (EFC14153/LIBERTY ASTHMA VOYAGE). Dupilumab was tested against placebo as 
add-on therapy in combination with standard-of-care medication. 
Supportive long-term safety and efficacy data comes from the ongoing open-label extension study 
LTS14424, a one-year study to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of dupilumab in 
paediatric patients with asthma who participated in a previous dupilumab asthma clinical study 
(LTS14424/LIBERTY ASTHMA EXCURSION). 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The pivotal study EFC14153 (VOYAGE) was adequately designed to investigate the efficacy of 
dupilumab in the defined target population based on the EMA Clinical investigation of medicinal 
products for the treatment of asthma (CHMP/EWP/2922/01 Rev.1).  
The eligibility criteria appropriately defined the target population suffering from refractory asthma, 
requiring treatment step 4 or 5 according to GINA2015 Guideline. The required evidence of 
uncontrolled asthma adheres to the GINA guideline definitions based on aspects of asthma symptom 
control. The study objectives are reflected by the chosen endpoints; these are in line with the EMA 
Guideline on Clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of asthma 
(CHMP/EWP/2922/01 Rev.1) and represent relevant factors for asthma symptom control. A broad 
range of secondary outcomes were analyzed which is standard for the evaluation of chronic asthma 
treatment. 
Overall, there was a low number of major protocol deviations in the ITT population (DUP 2.6% vs. PLC 
2.2%) mainly due to treatment incompliance, hampered assessments/procedures and violations of 
eligibility criteria. However, the patient numbers within the different categories were small and 
balanced between treatment groups and thus, a significant impact on efficacy and safety results seems 
unlikely. A sensitivity analysis to account for the use of SCS showed results similar to those of the 
primary efficacy analysis for both primary efficacy populations.  
As to demographics and patient characteristics at baseline, patients included the combined pre-
specified primary efficacy populations, i.e. the populations with type 2 inflammatory asthma phenotype 
defined by baseline blood eosinophils ≥0.15 Giga/L or FeNO ≥20 ppb and the population defined by 
baseline blood eosinophils ≥0.3 Giga/L (n=259) had a median age of 9.0 years. The majority of 
subjects enrolled to this study were white, two thirds were male and had a body weight >30 kg at 
baseline. Overall, demographics and patient characteristics are relatively similar between the 
treatment arms of all analysed populations apart from the sex. Boys have an increased prevalence of 
childhood asthma compared to girls which have led to the inclusion of lower female patient numbers. 
Regarding the different efficacy outcomes in male and female study participants, a more balanced 
gender ratio would have been beneficial as to interpretation of the results that are reflected below. 
Regarding baseline disease characteristics for two primary efficacy populations, the median age at 
onset of asthma was 3.0 years and 5.7 years had elapsed between the first diagnosis of asthma and 
Assessment report

study entry. The number of severe asthma exacerbations within the last year before study entry had 
been 2, one exacerbation thereof had required hospitalisation or urgent medical care, and 20.8% had 
experienced ≥4 exacerbations (median). Baseline pre-bronchodilator FEV1 percent was 79.0% with a 
reversibility of 16%, these values qualified for expiratory airflow limitation with a positive 
bronchodilator reversibility test. 44.4% of all patients had a high and 54.5% a medium ICS dose level 
at baseline. These facts mirror the disease severity in the included paediatric study population. As to 
disease characteristics at baseline, the applicant was asked to provide extra information on pre-
existent asthma triggers such as seasonal and perennial allergens and their elimination before study 
entry, exposition to passive smoke, exacerbations based on viral infections, and adherence to inhaler 
technique before enrolment in order to evaluate the medical need for therapy escalation. Additionally, 
the optimal treatment duration was to be clarified. However, as this information was not collected 
during the studies, no specific information on these aspects could have been provided by the applicant. 
As to baseline biomarkers, the median baseline eosinophil count was (mean) 0.57 G/l in the population 
with the type 2 inflammatory asthma phenotype, which is to be classified as mild peripheral 
eosinophilia in children aged 6-11years based on the literature. Mean FeNO values were elevated 
(mean 30.7 ppb, normal <20 ppb) and the majority (74.0%) had baseline eosinophil counts ≥0.3 
Giga/L. 
In the efficacy population defined as those with baseline blood eosinophils ≥0.3 Giga/L, mean 
eosinophil count at baseline was 0.71 Giga/L (hypereosinophilia >1.5 G/l). Dupilumab’s effect seems to 
increase proportionally with increasing eosinophil counts similar to the effect observed in adults.  
At baseline, the majority of patients in the population with the type 2 inflammatory asthma phenotype 
and with baseline blood eosinophils ≥0.3 Giga/L, respectively (96.9% in each population) were using 2 
types of controller medications. Similar percentages used medium (54.4%) or high-dose (44.4%) ICS, 
most patients in combination with LABA (83.8%). Only 2 patients applied a third type of controller. 
Results were consistent with those of the ITT population. 6/259 (2.3%) were treated with ICS only at 
baseline and this is not representative for GINA Step 4 +5. The evaluated patient population is 
considered representative as regards patient and disease characteristics. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The full intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy population includes all randomized patients and consists of 408 
patients, 273 of these were randomized to the dupilumab group and 135 to the placebo group (2:1). 
The majority had Type 2 inflammatory asthma phenotype (85.8%) and Baseline blood eosinophils 
≥0.15 Giga/L (81.1%), 63.5% had Baseline blood eosinophils ≥0.3 Giga/L and Baseline FeNO ≥20 
ppb. The percentage allocation of the different efficacy populations, identified by baseline type 2 
biomarkers, was fairly balanced across treatment groups.  
Overall, 248/273 (90.8%) of the ITT population completed the study treatment period after 52 weeks 
and slightly more patients assigned to the dupilumab group prematurely discontinued the study drug 
(DUP 8.1% vs. PLC 3.7%), however, no specific reason prevailed. 87.5% of all patients and slighty 
more patients of the placebo group continued dupilumab treatment in the open-label extension study 
LTS14424 study, which is still ongoing. 
As mentioned above, 2 primary efficacy populations were defined, i.e. the population with the type 2 
inflammatory asthma phenotype defined as the randomized patients with baseline blood eosinophils 
≥0.15 Giga/L or baseline FeNO ≥20 ppb and the population with baseline blood eosinophils ≥0.3 
Giga/L defined as the randomized patients with baseline blood eosinophils ≥0.3 Giga/L. The patients’ 
disposition and the participant flow were very similar for the 2 primary efficacy populations and the full 
intention-to-treat (ITT) population. The primary analysis of both pre-specified populations is endorsed 
as these form the correct database with regard to the indication wording that is analogous to that for 
the adolescent/adult patient population. Thus, these results are further discussed here.

The mean compliance with administration of the IMP was high (around 99%). ICS and controller 
medication use were relatively steady (approximately 80% for all medications). Thus, reliable data are 
provided for assessment.  
The primary endpoint for the EFC1415 study was the annualized rate of severe exacerbation events 
during the 52-week treatment period. 
The annualized rate of severe exacerbation events during pivotal study EFC14153 was lower in both 
verum groups of the primary efficacy populations, i.e. the type 2 inflammatory asthma phenotype and 
the baseline blood eosinophils ≥0.3 Giga/L, respectively (DUP 0.305 vs. PLC 0.748 and DUP 0.235 vs. 
PLC 0.665). The overall relative risk reduction versus placebo was 59.3% and 64.7%, respectively. 
Meaningful differences as to gender were observed, i.e. 65% (p-value vs. placebo <0.0001) for male 
and 27 % for female (p-value vs. placebo <0.5) participants. The MAH reasoned this by the lower 
exacerbation rate and disease severity in the year prior to enrollment observed in the female subgroup 
of the placebo arm. This may have led to an unexpectedly low exacerbation rate in the placebo group 
and thus, to the smaller treatment effect in the female participants. Based on the literature (Bonini et 
al., 2020) it is concurred that the relative risk reduction in the annualized rate of severe exacerbations 
is still clinically meaningful.  
A specific treatment effect was also observed within the other efficacy populations (cf. statistical 
methods of study EFC14153 above) including patients exhibiting baseline blood eosinophils ≥0.15 
Giga/L (DUP 0.318 vs. PLC 0.816) or baseline FeNO ≥20 ppb (DUP 0.271 vs. PLC 0.705). All these 
results were statistically significant (p<0.0001). Over time (cf. correspondent plot), the cumulative 
mean number of severe exacerbations was lower in the verum groups in all four biomarker-based 
efficacy populations. Similarly, the relative risk in annualized rate of severe exacerbation events during 
the 52-week treatment period is lower for all 5 efficacy populations that received dupilumab. 
Consistent with these results, in dupilumab treated patients the time-to-first severe exacerbation event 
was prolonged in all analysed efficacy populations. The sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of 
the efficacy results indicating a clinically meaningful efficacy in the claimed indication.  
Supportive information on efficacy data include subgroup analysis as to gender, region, race and body 
weight. Regarding the gender, the adjusted annualized severe exacerbation event rate was lower for 
males and females assigned to the dupilumab treatment groups of both primary efficacy populations 
compared to the placebo groups. Similarly, to the results concerning the primary endpoint, the effect 
for females was lower than for males (see above). This was also observed for other secondary 
endpoints including ACQ-7-IA and PAQLQ(S)-IA where no benefit (with a tendency to even negative 
effects) was observed in female subjects. Based on the additionally submitted data, it is concurred that 
these findings may be explained by the reasons mentioned for the divergent results of the primary 
endpoint, as eg. PAQLQ(S)-IA includes an item related to the symptom severity and thus, the 
endpoints are interdependent. 
Study treatment was administered according to the body weight, i.e. for patients with body weight ≥
16 to <30kg: 100 mg q2w or 300 mg q4w; for patients with body weight ≥30kg to <60 kg: 200 mg 
q2w or 300 mg q4w and for patients with body weight ≥60 kg: 200 mg q2w.  
The efficacy results were consistent and statistically significant in both primary efficacy populations 
with regard to baseline weight groups, i.e. ≤30 kg bw (type 2 inflammatory asthma phenotype: DUP 
0.196 vs. PLC 0.618; baseline blood eosinophils ≥0.3 Giga/L: DUP 0.244 vs. PLC 0.710) and ≥30 kg 
bw (type 2 inflammatory asthma phenotype: DUP 0.344 vs. PLC 0.766; baseline blood eosinophils 
≥0.3 Giga/L: DUP 0.209 vs. PLC 0.594). 
The key secondary endpoint was defined as the change from baseline in percent predicted pre-
bronchodilator FEV1 at Week 12.  
In the efficacy population with the type 2 inflammatory asthma phenotype, the LS mean change from 
baseline in percent predicted pre-BD FEV1 at Week 12 was 10.53% (DUP) vs. 5.32% (PLC). Very 
similar results were observed in the population with baseline blood eosinophils ≥0.3 Giga/L, i.e. 
Assessment report  
EMA/98744/2022  
Page 56/88 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10.15% (DUP) vs. 4.83% (PLC) as well as in the population with baseline blood eosinophils ≥0.15 
Giga/L (DUP 10.36% vs. 5.65%) or baseline FeNO ≥ 20 ppb (DUP 11.36% vs. PLC 4.62%) indicating 
that the forced expiratory volume after 1 second hat improved after 12 weeks of dupilumab treatment. 
All results are statistically significant (p<0.005). In the combined efficacy population characterized by 
baseline FeNO ≤ 20 ppb and Baseline blood eosinophils ≤0.15 Giga/, no significant treatment effect 
could be detected, which is plausible considering the fact that no correlation with disease severity is to 
be expected in these patients. A sustained treatment effect was observable over time also reflected by 
the maintained LS mean change from baseline in PP FEV1 placebo after 52 weeks in all five efficacy 
populations.  
Other secondary endpoints were effects on asthma control as measured by ACQ-7-IA including a ACQ-
7-IA responder analysis, effects on PAQLQ(S)-IA, loss of asthma control (LOAC) events, type 2 airway 
inflammation, exposure to systemic corticosteroids and reliever medication, disease specific health-
related quality of life (EQ-VAS), allergic rhinitis specific health-related quality of life in patients with 
comorbid allergic rhinitis. 
More significant reductions from baseline in Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-7-IA) scores at Week 
24 were observed in all dupilumab-treated patients compared with placebo, mirrored by higher LS 
mean changes in all 5 pre-defined efficacy populations and higher responder percentages in the verum 
groups. A clinically relevant change was defined as the minimum clinically important difference of 0.5 
based on ‘The Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention’ (GINA2021) which is 
acceptable. All results were statistically significant or relevant. Another aspect of treatment benefit of 
dupilumab was also shown by reduction of the annualized rate of loss of asthma control events (LOAC) 
during the treatment period and by delay of the time to LOAC events during the treatment period and 
during the overall study period compared with placebo in both primary efficacy populations. The 
applicant was asked to submit the corresponding results of the remaining three efficacy populations 
taking into account the different dose groups; these confirmed a consistent efficacy.  
Additionally, dupilumab’s effect on airway inflammation was investigated by measuring the fractional 
concentration of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) levels, a marker that is increased in eosinophilic asthma 
and other atopic conditions. LS mean change from baseline in FeNO at Week 12 was higher in the 
verum groups, i.e. for the efficacy population with type 2 inflammatory asthma phenotype 18.94 ppb 
(DUP) compared to 0.98 ppb (PLC) and for patients included in the population with baseline blood 
eosinophil ≥0.3 Giga/L -21.85 ppb (DUP) compared to 0.89 (PLC). Similar effects were observed in the 
other efficacy populations suggesting an adequate short- and long-term effect on airway inflammation. 
Patients assigned to the dupilumab groups of both primary efficacy populations had a lower intake of 
systemic corticosteroids compared with those of the placebo groups during the pivotal study as 
reflected by a slightly shorter annualized total SCS duration, for instance.  
Dupilumab’s effect on health-related quality of life was assessed by evaluating the LS mean change of 
Paediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire Scores with Standardized Activities (PAQLQ(S)-IA) at 
Weeks 12, 24, 36, and 52, for children ≥7 years. The questionnaire is considered to have a relatively 
good validity as regards the measurement of functional problems in daily life of children suffering from 
asthma. In both primary efficacy populations clinically important changes in scores were observed in 
favour of dupilumab treatment, however, results became nominally significant after 24 weeks (Baseline 
blood eosinophils >=0.3 Giga/L population) and after 36 weeks (Type 2 inflammatory asthma 
phenotype population). Hence, these results are considered clinically relevant after long-term therapy 
with dupilumab. This is also reflected by the PAQLQ(S)-IA responder analysis and an overall 
improvement in EQ-VAS in the 2 primary efficacy populations.  
Several pre-specified subgroup analyses were performed. The biomarker subgroup analyses evaluated 
dupilumab’s effect on the annualized rate of severe exacerbation events and on the change from 
baseline in percent predicted pre-BD FEV1 at Week 12 in the ITT population defined by baseline type 2 
biomarker level, including blood eosinophils (<0.15 Giga/L, ≥0.15-0.3 Giga/L, ≥0.3-0.5 Giga/L, and 
≥0.5 Giga/L) and FeNO (<20 ppb and ≥20 ppb). Results showed exacerbation reduction compared to 
placebo for all subgroups with baseline blood eosinophils ≥0.15 Giga/L and for both subgroups defined 
Assessment report

by baseline FeNO. Again, no treatment benefit was observed for patients in the subgroup with baseline 
blood eosinophils <0.15 Giga/L or with baseline FeNO <20 ppb. Pre-specified treatment-by-biomarker 
interaction effects were detected in the ITT population for continuous baseline FeNO and blood 
eosinophils on the annualized severe exacerbation rate and LS mean change in percent predicted pre-
BD FEV1. Hence, both biomarkers serve independently for the identification of dupilumab responders. 
This is also supported by the quadrant analysis. 
Thus, a treatment-by-subgroup interaction was observed in patients with elevated blood eosinophils 
and FeNO, meaning that the treatment effect differs depending on baseline biomarker values, i.e. 
decreases in patients with eosinophils < 0.15 Giga/L and FeNO < 20 ppb.  
The applicant suggested a weight-based dosing for paediatric patients with asthma age 6 to <12 years 
as already existent for other indications, i.e. for patients with body weight ≥15 to <30kg: 100 mg q2w 
or 300 mg q4w; for those ≥30kg to <60 kg: 200 mg q2w or 300 mg q4w and for patients with body 
weight ≥60 kg: 200 mg q2w and it was reflected as reflected in  section 4.2. of the SmPc . Efficacy 
results related to the diverse dose regimes of the Phase 3 studies were consistent for all efficacy 
populations. Data on the 300 mg q4w dose regimen are uncontrolled and limited to 18 patients 
weighing <30 kg that were treated during OLE study LTS14424 (see below). Efficacy and safety results 
do not give rise to any objections against this dose regimen which is already authorized for AD patients 
with a body weight of 15-≤60 kg following a split loading dose of 300 mg each on Day 1 and 15. Thus, 
this alternative dose regimen is acceptable. 
The applicant’s analysis on efficacy results across the adult/adolescent and paediatric population 
delivered similar results. The underlying disease characteristics in terms of severe asthma 
exacerbations frequencies before study entry, asthma control, comorbid atopic conditions and type 2 
inflammatory biomarkers were relatively similar, if applicable.  
The ongoing open-label extension study in children 6 to <12 years who participated in pivotal Phase 3 
study EFC14153 evaluating the long-term safety, tolerability of dupilumab, long term efficacy, 
pharmacokinetic (PK), and immunogenicity provides supportive data up to 104 weeks of treatment 
with dupilumab. Analysed efficacy endpoints were the annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbation 
events and change in percent predicted FEV. Dose adjustments were performed at study entry, if 
needed. Long-term data is available from 189/365 (51.8%) patients that were treated for additional 52 
weeks. The unadjusted annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbations during the treatment period in 
LTS14424 for all exposed patients was 0.134 and very similar for both pre- and newly exposed 
patients (cf. primary efficacy population of pivotal study adjusted annualized rate was 2.24-0.3). The 
majority had no severe asthma exacerbations throughout the study (336/365 patients (92.1%)). 
Regarding the 300 mg q4w dose regimen, no exacerbation was recorded, however, the duration of 
exposure was limited to 42.6 days (mean). 
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The superiority of dupilumab over placebo is demonstrated for both dose regimens (100/200 mg q2w 
and 300 mg q4w) regarding the primary and key secondary endpoints.  
Overall, dupilumab appears to be efficacious in paediatric patients with severe asthma with type 2 
inflammation that is characterized by elevated blood eosinophils and /or raised FeNO.

 Disposition of study subjects and extent of exposure 
Study EFC14153   
A total of 408 patients were randomized (273 patients in the dupilumab group and 135 patients in the 
placebo group). Among them, 405 were treated (3 patients, all in the dupilumab group, were 
randomized but not treated, 2 due to not meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria and 1 due to patient’s 
decision). Among the 405 patients treated, 392 completed the study and 27 prematurely discontinued 
treatment. Early treatment discontinuation rate was higher in the dupilumab group compared to the 
placebo group (22 [8.1%] versus 5 [3.7%] patients, respectively). The main reasons for treatment 
discontinuation were AE (1.8 % in the dupilumab group and 1.5% in the placebo group) and 
vaccination prohibited by protocol (yellow fever vaccine or MMR) (6 patients in the dupilumab group).   
Study duration was similar between placebo and dupilumab treatment groups, with a median of 365 
days for each treatment group, and a mean of 364.93 in the placebo group and 361.75 in the 
dupilumab group.  
Study LTS14424   
Among the 405 patients randomized and treated in Study EFC14153, 365 rolled over to the OLE (Study 
LTS14424), all receiving open-label study treatment with dupilumab (at either 100 mg q2w, 200 mg 
q2w, or 300 mg q4w).  
As of the study data cut-off date (18 August 2020), 196 patients completed the 52-week open-label 
study treatment period (70 in the placebo-dupilumab category and 126 in the dupilumab-dupilumab 
category), 155 were still ongoing (52 in the placebo-dupilumab category and 103 in the dupilumab-
dupilumab category), and 14 patients prematurely discontinued treatment. Study duration was similar 
between placebo and dupilumab treatment groups, with a median of 375.0 days in the placebo-
dupilumab category and 371.5 days in the dupilumab-dupilumab category, and a mean of 339.2 in the 
placebo-dupilumab category and 329.7 in the dupilumab-dupilumab category.  
2.6.8.2.   Disease characteristics 
EFC14153: The patients’ disease characteristics at baseline were consistent between dupilumab and 
placebo groups. Approximately 44.1% of patients were on high dose ICS at baseline, 55.1% were on 
medium dose ICS (plus 1 additional controller), and 0.7% (all in the dupilumab group) were on low 
dose ICS (in deviation of the protocol). The mean number of severe asthma exacerbation in the prior 
year was slightly higher in the dupilumab group as compared to placebo group (2.56 versus 2.19), 
however, median values were similar between treatment groups (2.0). Other asthma-specific baseline 
characteristics were similar between treatment groups and indicative of an enrolled population 
comprised of patients with moderate-to-severe uncontrolled disease.  
The majority of patients (92.4%) reported having an ongoing atopic disease, allergic rhinitis being the 
most frequent (81.9%). Atopic dermatitis was reported in 36.3% of patients. All patients were 
receiving background asthma controller therapy at stable doses at study entry and continued with 
these medications throughout the study.

LTS14424: The disease characteristics at baseline of the parent study EFC14153 for the population 
enrolled in Study LTS14424 were similar between the two treatment categories.  
Asthma-specific characteristics were similar between the two treatment groups at the baseline of the 
parent study, with an overall mean percent predicted pre-BD FEV1 of 77.68% (14.68). At Week 0 of 
the OLE study LTS14424, the mean percent predicted pre-BD FEV1 was higher in the dupilumab-
dupilumab category (89.16%) than in the placebo-dupilumab category (82.97%), reflecting the 
differential treatment effects of dupilumab versus placebo in the parent study.   
The profile of medical/surgical history was similar between the initial randomized population (Study 
EFC14153) and the population that rolled-over into Study LTS14424.  
2.6.8.3.  Adverse Events 
Study EFC14153 
The percentage of patients with any TEAE was similar in the dupilumab group compared with the 
placebo group (83.0% and 79.9%, respectively). There were no deaths reported during the study and 
the incidence of treatment-emergent SAEs was 4.8% in the dupilumab group versus 4.5% in the 
placebo group. The overall rate of treatment discontinuation due to TEAEs was 1.8% in the dupilumab 
group and 1.5% in the placebo groups (Table 5).  
Table 5: Overview of adverse event profile: Treatment-emergent adverse events in 
Study EFC14153 – Safety population  
The number (%) of patients with at least 1 TEAE by primary SOC is presented in Table 6. The SOCs 
with the highest proportion of patients with TEAEs (≥10% of patients in either treatment group) were 
infections and infestations (65.3% in the dupilumab group versus 70.1% in the placebo group), 
General disorders and administration site conditions (22.5% versus 18.7%), Respiratory, thoracic and 
mediastinal disorders (17.7% versus 26.9%, respectively), Gastrointestinal disorders (14.8% versus 
9.7%, respectively), Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (12.5% versus 10.4%, respectively), and 
Injury, poisoning and procedural complications (15.1% versus 14.2%, respectively).  
The incidence of TEAEs at the SOC level was similar between the dupilumab and placebo groups, with 
the exception of the following SOCs for which a ≥5% difference between treatment groups was 
observed. The SOC with TEAEs more frequently reported in the dupilumab group compared to placebo 
were as follows:  
•  Blood and lymphatic system disorders (8.5% in the dupilumab group versus 3.0% in the 
placebo group), driven by eosinophilia PT (5.9% versus 0.7%).  
•  Gastrointestinal disorders (14.8% in the dupilumab group versus 9.7% in the placebo group), 
mainly driven by abdominal pain, nausea, and constipation. All events reported in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/98744/2022  
Page 60/88 
 
 
 
 
 
gastrointestinal disorders SOC were mild to moderate in intensity, none were serious or led to 
permanent treatment discontinuation. All events were assessed by the Investigator as not 
related to the IMP except for 1 event of nausea.

The following TEAEs were reported more frequently in the dupilumab group when compared with the 
placebo group (≥5% in the dupilumab group and a difference of ≥1% versus the placebo group at the 
PT level, cf. Table 7): 
•  Viral upper respiratory tract infection (dupilumab: 12.2%, placebo: 9.7%); however, the 
incidence of TEAEs in the HLT of upper respiratory tract infections (40.2% in the dupilumab 
group versus 44.0% in the placebo group) and in the HLT of lower respiratory tract infections 
NEC (not elsewhere classified) (7.7% versus 11.2%, respectively) was comparable between 
treatment groups  
•  Eosinophilia (dupilumab: 5.9%, placebo: 0.7%)  
• 
• 
• 
Injection site erythema (dupilumab: 12.9%, placebo: 9.7%)  
Injection site edema (dupilumab: 10.3%, placebo: 5.2%)  
Injection site nodule (dupilumab: 6.3%, placebo: 2.2%).  
In contrast, the following TEAEs were reported less frequently in the dupilumab group compared with 
the placebo group (≥5% in the placebo group and a difference of ≥1% versus the dupilumab group at 
the PT level):  
•  Nasopharyngitis (dupilumab: 18.5%, placebo: 21.6%)  
•  Pharyngitis (dupilumab: 8.9%, placebo: 10.4%)  
Influenza (dupilumab: 7.4%, placebo: 9.0%)  
• 
•  Bronchitis (dupilumab: 6.3%, placebo: 10.4%) • Rhinitis allergic (dupilumab: 5.9%, placebo: 
11.9%)  
•  Cough (dupilumab: 5.5%, placebo: 6.7%).  
•  Sinusitis (dupilumab: 3.3%, placebo: 5.2%)  
•  Accidental overdose (dupilumab: 1.1%, placebo: 5.2%).

population 
An imbalance between treatment groups was observed for parasitic infections which was reported in 7 
(2.6%) patients in the dupilumab group versus 1 (0.7%) patient in the placebo group (parasitic 
gastroenteritis erroneously not recorded as AESI). Among the events reported in the dupilumab group, 
there were 5 events of enterobiasis and all were assessed as not related to the IMP by the 
Investigator. However, a possible causal relationship between parasitic infection and dupilumab cannot 
be excluded. The PT of enterobiasis was designated as an adverse drug reaction (ADR) from Study 
EFC14153.

Most TEAEs were mild in intensity (38.7% in the dupilumab group and 38.1% in the placebo group) or 
moderate (41.3% and 37.3%, respectively). Severe TEAEs were reported for 8 (3.0%) patients in the 
dupilumab group and 6 (4.5%) patients in the placebo group.  
Most TEAEs were considered by the Investigator to be unrelated to the IMP. The most frequently 
reported TEAEs (≥1% at PT level) that were considered by the Investigator to be related to the IMP 
were injection site erythema (12.9% in the dupilumab group versus 9.7% in the placebo group), 
injection site edema (10.3% versus 5.2%), injection site nodule (6.3% versus 2.2%), injection site 
pruritus (2.2% versus 2.2%), injection site pain (1.8% versus 1.5%), eosinophilia (1.8% versus 0), 
headache (1.5% versus 0.7%), injection site inflammation (1.5% versus 0), injection site urticaria 
(1.1% versus 1.5%), and accidental overdose (1.1% versus 0.7%).  
No clinically meaningful differences were observed between subgroups based on body weight except 
for a higher incidence of injection site reactions observed in the subgroup of patients with baseline 
body weight >30 kg. 
Study LTS14424 
As of the data cut-off date of Study LTS14424, there were no death reported, and the incidence of 
both treatment-emergent SAE and TEAE leading to permanent treatment discontinuation was 1.4% 
and 0.5%, respectively. Overall, 201 (55.1%) patients experienced at least 1 TEAE during the study 
(Table 8). When adjusted by exposure, the incidence rate for patients with any TEAEs was higher in 
patients previously treated with placebo (153.1 patients per 100 PY) compared to those previously 
treated with dupilumab (102.0 patients per 100 PY) in the parent study.   
The overall exposure-adjusted incidence for patients with at least 1 TEAE was lower in Study LTS14424 
(117.4 per 100 PY) compared to the dupilumab group in Study EFC14153 (220.2 per 100 PY). The 
profile of TEAE by SOC was similar to the parent study (Study EFC14153), with Infections and 
infestations being the most frequently reported SOC (40.8%). At the SOC level, the incidence of TEAEs 
was similar between the dupilumab-dupilumab and placebo-dupilumab categories (Table 8).

by primary SOC and PT is presented in Table 10. Most of the TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity 
and 76.6% of patients had TEAEs that were considered as not related to the IMP by the Investigator. 
As for the parent study (Study EFC14153), the most frequently reported TEAEs (≥2% at PT level) that 
were assessed by the Investigator as related to the IMP were injection site reaction (4.4%) and 
injection site erythema (2.2%).

Among the 14 patients who were exposed to 300 mg q4w, 4 patients experienced TEAEs during their 
exposure to 300 mg q4w:1 in the placebo-dupilumab category (skin laceration) and 3 in the 
dupilumab-dupilumab category (headache and abdominal pain, injection site reaction, and scratch 
[right leg]). Of these 4 patients, 1 patient had a similar TEAE (injection site reaction) before switching 
to 300 mg q4w. None of the TEAEs reported during the 300 mg q4w exposure were serious or led to 
permanent treatment discontinuation.    
2.6.8.4.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
 Deaths 
There were no deaths reported during Study EFC14153 and LTS14424 (up to the Study LTS14424 data 
cut-off date of 18 August 2020).  
Serious Adverse Events 
Study EFC14153 
Most treatment-emergent SAEs occurred in 1 patient each, with the exception of asthma exacerbation 
(PT: asthma) that was reported by 4 (1.5%) patients in the dupilumab group (versus none in the 
placebo group) and eosinophilia that was reported by 2 (0.7%) patients in the dupilumab group 
(versus none in the placebo group). 4/271 patients (1.5%) in the dupilumab group and 0/134 patients 
in the placebo group experienced SAEs of asthma exacerbation requiring hospitalization. 3 out of 4 
patients with SAEs of asthma reported at least 5 severe asthma exacerbations in the prior year, and in 
these 3 patients, the number of severe exacerbations observed during the course of the study 
significantly decreased compared to that observed in the prior year. When referring to severe

exacerbations leading to hospitalization or emergency room visit during the study in the intent to treat 
population, the overall rate was comparable between treatment groups (9 [3.3%] in the dupilumab 
group and 6 [4.4%] in the placebo group). As per protocol, only asthma exacerbations fulfilling 
seriousness criteria qualified for safety reporting, and as such, asthma exacerbations leading to an 
emergency room visit for less than 24 hours that was not considered as a medically important event by 
the Investigator were not reported as SAEs. Two patients, both in the dupilumab group, had 
treatment-emergent SAEs that were considered by the Investigator to be related to the IMP: 
pneumonia and eosinophilia with headache and blurred vision. 
Study LTS14424 
No patients experienced SAE of asthma exacerbation.  
The other SAEs (complicated appendicitis, pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infection, and 
atelectasis) did not lead to treatment discontinuation, resolved with corrective treatment, and were 
assessed as not related to the IMP.  There were no treatment-emergent SAE in the patients exposed to 
the 300 mg q4w regimen.   
Adverse Events leading to permanent treatment discontinuation 
Study EFC14153 
The overall treatment discontinuation rate due to AEs was low and similar between treatment groups 
(1.8% in the dupilumab group versus 1.5% in the placebo group).  
Most of the TEAEs that led to discontinuation occurred in only 1 patient each in any given treatment 
group, with the exception of:  
• 
Injection site erythema and injection site edema PTs (2 patients in the dupilumab group versus 
none in the placebo group). Both cases were severe injection site reaction lasting for at least 24 hours 
and meeting AESI criteria. 
• 
• 
Neutropenia (dupilumab200 mg q2w).  
In addition, in the dupilumab group, 1 patient experienced erythema multiforme and 1 patient 
experienced eosinophilia, both leading to permanent treatment discontinuation.  
Study LTS14424 
The number of TEAE leading to treatment discontinuation was very low. Two (0.5%) patients, who 
both received dupilumab in the parent study (dupilumab-dupilumab category), experienced TEAEs 
leading to permanent treatment discontinuation (Pulmonary tuberculosis and Conjunctivitis allergic, 
both events assessed by the Investigator as related to the IMP. When adjusted by exposure, the 
incidence rate for patients with any TEAE leading to treatment discontinuation was 0.0 patients per 
100 PY in patients previously treated with placebo and 0.9 patients per 100 PY in those previously 
treated with dupilumab in the parent study.  
There were no TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation reported in patients exposed to the 300 mg 
q4w regimen.  
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Study EFC14153 
There were no opportunistic infections, no malignancy, no pregnancy, and no symptomatic overdose to 
IMP or non-investigational medicinal product (NIMP) reported.  
Assessment report

Study LTS14424 
There were no AESI in the patients exposed to the 300 mg q4w regimen. As in the parent study, no 
malignancy, no pregnancy, and no symptomatic overdose to IMP or non-investigational medicinal 
product were reported. 
Adverse drug reactions 
The primary assessment for ADRs was conducted in the placebo-controlled Study EFC14153. Analysis 
was based on individual PTs and selected AE groupings (predefined SMQs/CMQs) in the Study 
EFC14153 safety population (N=405 patients). 
The qualification of a TEAE PT as an ADR is based on the following quantitative and qualitative criteria: 
• Quantitative Criteria: The PTs with incidence ≥1% in the dupilumab group and difference ≥1% 
versus placebo group and with lower bound of the 95% CI of relative risk >1 compared to placebo. 
• Qualitative Criteria: Medical judgement was applied to confirm the PTs which met quantitative criteria 
as well as for qualifying the PTs, which did not meet the quantitative threshold, but deemed medically 
important to be made an ADR. The seriousness, severity, outcome of the TEAE and impact on IMP 
administered were also considered.  
Despite not meeting the quantitative threshold for ADRs, enterobiasis is considered an ADR based on 
the numerical imbalance between treatment groups (1.8% in the dupilumab group versus 0% in the 
placebo group) and the theoretical mechanism that suppression of IL-4 and IL-13 may impair immune 
responses against helminthic infection. All events of enterobiasis recovered with anthelminthic 
treatment. The potential safety concern of helminthic infections is already included in the warning 
section of the current labeling. In addition, injection site reactions are considered as ADR despite not 
meeting the quantitative criteria based on the observed imbalance between treatment groups and 
because injection site reactions are considered as ADRs across indications for dupilumab. No additional 
ADRs were identified in the OLE study (Study LTS14424). 
2.6.8.5.  Laboratory findings 
Mean blood eosinophil counts were elevated in both groups, with higher baseline values in the 
dupilumab versus placebo group (mean [SE]: 0.527 [0.410] Giga/L versus 0.446 [0.358] Giga/L, 
respectively). In the dupilumab group, a transient increase in the mean blood eosinophil count was 
observed at the first post-baseline assessment at Week 12; the mean eosinophil count returned to the 
baseline values by Week 36 (0.536 [0.584]. 
Overall, eosinophilia was considered as a TEAE in 18 patients in the dupilumab group and 1 patient in 
the placebo group, and were mainly self-limiting laboratory findings without any associated symptoms. 
Eosinophilia events with associated clinical symptoms were rarely reported, one case of serious 
eosinophilia led to permanent treatment discontinuation and was assessed as related to the IMP. Two 
cases of neutropenia led to treatment discontinuation (1 in the placebo and 1 in the dupilumab group). 
During LTS14424, Changes in blood eosinophil mean or median from baseline were the same as the 
dupilumab group in the parent study. 
As to clinical chemistry, dupilumab treatment did not result in changes in electrolytes or metabolic 
parameters in both studies. Moreover, Dupilumab treatment did not result in changes in liver or renal 
function tests over the course of both studies.

2.6.8.6.  Immunological events 
Immunogenicity 
The ADA incidence in Study EFC14153 and Study LTS14424 is presented in Table 11. 
Table 11: ADA incidence in Study EFC14153 and Study LTS14424 
In the dupilumab group, 14 out of the 17 (82.4%) ADA-positive patients and 210 out of the 252 
(83.3%) ADA-negative patients experienced at least 1 TEAE during the study. There was no apparent 
pattern or increase in TEAE incidence in the ADA-positive patients compared with the ADA-negative 
patients. The TEAEs that occurred on or after the first postdose ADA positive response with a higher 
frequency in the dupilumab-treated ADA-positive subgroup compared to ADA-negative or placebo 
group (≥10% difference) were AEs that are not usually associated with ADA-positive response and 
consisted of pharyngitis, headache, and vomiting. However, due to small number of patients with an 
ADA positive response (N=17) versus ADA negative response (N=252), it is difficult to draw any 
definitive conclusion on the potential influence of treatment-emergent ADA response on the incidence 
of TEAEs. Among patients with a treatment-emergent ADA response, none had events that were 
considered SAEs and 1 patient had a TEAE that resulted in permanent treatment discontinuation. This 
patient was ADA negative around the time of the event and had a transient treatment-emergent ADA 
response with low titer (30) around 5 months later. 
The frequency of TEAEs was examined in patients who were positive in the NAb assay. The number of 
patients with positive NAb status was low (6) and does not allow for any meaningful interpretation of 
the impact of NAb on TEAEs. In patient with positive NAb status, there were no anaphylactic reaction, 
hypersensitivity or injection sire reactions. Two patients with negative Nab status experienced injection 
site reactions of which 1 was severe and led to treatment discontinuation. There was also 1 patient 
who experienced moderate urticarial. 
Of the 10 patients who had a persistent treatment-emergent positive ADA response, 7 out of 9 patients 
in the dupilumab group and 1 out of 1 patient in the placebo group experienced at least 1 TEAE. No 
particular pattern of AEs was observed.

In Study LTS14424, the treatment-emergent ADA incidence in the placebo-dupilumab category (8 
[7.3%]) was similar to that observed in the dupilumab group from the parent study EFC14153 (17 
[6.3%]). The treatment-emergent ADA incidence of 4 (1.9%) in the dupilumab-dupilumab category 
was lower than that observed in the dupilumab group from the parent study EFC14153 (17 [6.3%]) 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety data base comprises a total of evaluable 770 patients that were included in pivotal study 
EFC14153, a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled phase 3 study with 52 weeks treatment 
duration and in LTS14424, an ongoing, open-label extension study for patients previously enrolled in 
Study EFC14153. 
In study EFC14153, 405 patients were treated (273 patients in the dupilumab group and 135 patients 
in the placebo group) and 96.8% (392/405) completed the study. Slightly more patients assigned to 
the dupilumab group prematurely discontinued the study treatment (8.1% vs. 3.7%). The study 
duration was balanced between both treatment groups.  
90.1% (365/405) transitioned into the open-label extension study LTS14424 and 53.7% (196/365) 
patients thereof completed the 52-week treatment phase. 34.3% (93/271) of the dupilumab-treated 
patients rolling over from the parent study completed more than 52 weeks of treatment during the 
open-label extension study LTS14424. Thus, regulatory requirements as to long-term safety data are 
met. Demographics, patient and disease characteristics were fairly balanced between the treatment 
groups and categories, respectively, of both studies. 
Patients were assigned to three different dose regimens receiving dupilumab at either 100 mg q2w ≤ 
30 kg bw or 200 mg q2w ≥ 30 kg bw. As per protocol amendment 03 for study LTS14424, patients ≤ 
30 kg bw received an additional treatment regimen, i.e. 300 mg q4w. 
Overall, the percentage with any TEAE was slightly higher in the dupilumab treatment group, i.e. 
(DUP/PLC) 83.0% vs. 79.9%. Most TEAEs were reported in primary SOCs infections and infestations 
(65.3% vs. 70.1%), General disorders and administration site conditions (22.5% vs. 18.7%) and 
Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (17.7% vs. 26.9%, respectively).  
A higher TEAE frequency in the verum group was observed for SOCs Blood and lymphatic system 
disorders (8.5% vs. 3.0%) and Gastrointestinal disorders (14.8% vs. 9.7%). At PT level, eosinophilia 
and injection site reactions occurred more often in the dupilumab treatment group. Regarding viral or 
bacterial infections, no relevant imbalance was observed. However, more cases of parasitic infections 
such as enterobiasis were reported in the verum group (2.6% vs. 0.7%); despite a lacking causal 
relationship by medical judgement, the applicant suggests the designation of an ADR which is 
considered acceptable with regard to the numerical imbalance of this controlled data.  
In children 6 to 11 years of age with moderate-to-severe asthma (VOYAGE), the additional adverse 
reaction of enterobiasis was reported in 1.8 % (5 patients) in the dupilumab groups and none in the 
placebo group. All enterobiasis cases were mild to moderate and patients recovered with anti-helminth 
treatment without dupilumab treatment discontinuation as reflected in section 4.8 of the SmPC  
Most TEAEs were mild-to-moderate and considered unrelated to the study drug. The most frequently 
reported TEAEs (≥1% at PT level) that were considered by the Investigator to be related to the IMP 
were: Injection site erythema (12.9% vs. 9.7%), injection site edema (10.3% vs. 5.2%), injection site 
nodule (6.3% versus 2.2%), injection site pain (1.8% versus 1.5%), eosinophilia (1.8% versus 0), 
headache (1.5% versus 0.7%). Single events of allergic conjunctivitis, nausea and skin disorders were 
assessed as related.  
The overall TEAE frequency decreased over time, as reflected by the lower exposure-adjusted 
incidence rate for patients with at least 1 TEAE during study LTS14424 (117.4 per 100 PY) compared 
to the dupilumab group in Study EFC14153 (220 per 100 PY).

The results are consistent with the TEAE profiles that were analyzed during previous marketing 
authorization procedures. 
In children 6 to 11 years of age with moderate-to-severe asthma, eosinophilia (blood eosinophils 
≥ 3,000 cells/mcL or deemed by the investigator to be an adverse event) was reported in 6.6 % of the 
dupilumab groups and 0.7% in the placebo group. Most eosinophilia cases were mild to moderate and 
not associated with clinical symptoms. These cases were transient, decreased over time, and did not 
lead to dupilumab treatment discontinuation. 
During study LTS14424, overall, 55.1% patients experienced at least 1 TEAE and 12.9% were 
assessed as possibly related to dupilumab.Generally, patients that had received dupilumab in the 
parent study reported TEAEs less frequently (50.8% vs. 63.2%). Single cases of ascariasis, 
enterobiasis, hordeolum, pulmonary tuberculosis, rash and headache were deemed related to the IMP. 
Most related TEAEs were reported for PTs Injection site reaction (4.4%), Injection site erythema 
(2.2%), Injection site nodule (1.4%), Accidental overdose (1.6%) and Eosinophilia (1.1%).  
These results are consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent and corresponding ADRs are 
largely reflected in the PI.  
During study EFC14153 the numbers of patients with treatment-emergent SAEs were generally low 
and comparable between both treatment groups (DUP 4.8% vs. PLC 4.5%). The individual cases were 
evenly distributed on the different SOCs and no specific pattern is evident. Two cases of pneumonia 
and eosinophilia with headache and blurred vision were assessed as possibly related to dupilumab. 
Another case of pulmonary tuberculosis was reported during LTS14424.  
There were no deaths during Study EFC14153 and LTS14424 until the data cut-off. 
Discontinuation rates were low in both studies and treatment groups. Individual TEAEs leading to 
permanent study drug discontinuation were attributed to different SOCs. No specific safety issue arises 
from these data. 
Predefined Adverse events of special interest (AESI) based on the safety profile observed with dupilumab 
in  adult  patients  were  the  following:  Systemic  or  extensive  hypersensitivity  reactions  including 
anaphylactic reactions, parasitic infections, symptomatic overdose and pregnancy. 
Numerical differences of AESI were observed at PT levels ‘Injection site reactions’ (17.7% DUP vs. 13.4% 
PLC) and eosinophilia (6.6% DUP vs. 0.7% PLC). Regarding the subgroup analysis, more patients ≤30 
kg bw experienced parasitic infections (5.5% vs. 1.1%) and eosinophilia (9.9% vs. 5.0%) than those ≥ 
30 kg bw. Conversely, injection site reactions occurred more often within the higher weight class (20.0% 
vs. 13.2%). It is concurred that this phenomenon could be partially linked to the higher injection volume 
as a similar percentage difference is present between the placebo groups of both weight cohorts. The 
number  of  patients  with  treatment-emergent  AESI  were  generally  low  in  LTS14424  with  qualitatively 
similar results.   
Specific AESI were further analyzed. One dupilumab-related case of erythema multiforme was reported 
during study EFC14153 that recovered under OCS. Individual cases of dupilumab-related injection site 
reactions, opportunistic infections and conjunctivitis occurred. 18/271 patients (6.6%) experienced 
TEAE eosinophilia in the dupilumab group vs. 1/134 patients (0.7%) in the placebo group. 6 cases 
were assessed as treatment-related TEAE and one led to discontinuation. Most were mild-to-moderate, 
only 1 severe case was reported, all patients recovered without sequelae, 2 needed corrective 
treatment. In study LTS14424 similar results were obtained. As to eosinophilia, 13/365 (3.6%) were 
reported. All events were transient, without associated symptoms and decreased over time. The 
majority was mild to moderate. The results are consistent with those of the adolescent and adult 
CRSwNP and AD population and listed as common ADR in the SmPC. No cases of pregnancy, 
symptomatic overdose or malignancy were reported.

Slightly more patients assigned to the dupilumab 200 mg Q2W group (>30 kg) had treatment-
emergent ADA response compared with the patients treated with 100 mg Q2W (≤30 kg), i.e. 7.3% vs. 
4.4%. However, the former included twice as many patients making ADA detection more likely in this 
group. The persistent ADA responses were balanced across the dupilumab groups and ADA response 
gradually decreased during LTS14424. Around 2% had neutralizing antibodies during both studies. 
These results are in line with previous study results of different study populations and do not raise new 
safety concerns (cf. SmPC).  
The safety profile cumulative exposure of 10.5 patient-years based on the data cut-off date of 
25 June 2021 including 18 patients with body weight ≤30 kg exposed to 300 mg q4w in LTS14424, has 
not changed from the time of the initial paediatric asthma 6 to 11 years old application with cumulative 
exposure of 1.6 patient-years. 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety database of the pivotal placebo-controlled phase 3 study EFC14153 comprises 405 
dupilumab-treated patients. Supportive long-term safety data of 196 patients that completed the 52-
week treatment phase of OLE study 14424 are additionally provided. Based on the Guideline on the 
clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of asthma (CHMP/EWP/2922/01 Rev.1.) 
the provided size of the data base is considered sufficient to assess the long-term safety of dupilumab 
in the claimed indication. 
Based on the data available, the overall risk of systemic hypersensitivity reactions, 
opportunistic/severe/serious infections, suicidal behaviour and conjunctivitis as well as malignancy with 
dupilumab appears low. Currently, no negative consequences on immune defence are obvious. The 
overall safety results are consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent, especially regarding the 
frequencies of Injection site reactions (ISR) and conjunctivitis under dupilumab treatment. It is 
concurred that ADRs enterobiasis and eosinophilia are included in the SmPC based on the provided 
data. 
2.7.  Risk Management Plan 
The MAH submitted RMP versions 6.0 and 6.1 with this application. The proposed RMP changes in RMP 
v. 6.0 were:

2.7.1.  Safety concerns 
The applicant proposed the following changes to the safety specification (RMP table SVIII.1) in the RMP 
v. 6.0 and 6.1:  
Data lock-point for the current RMP version 6.1 is 28-Sep-2020. 
Discussion of the safety specification 
New safety concerns and reclassification with a submission of an updated RMP  
The MAH concludes that “With reference to the final assessment report of procedure 
EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010645/202003, an amendment of the RMP safety specification has been 
requested, specifically the missing information “Conjunctivitis related events in AD patients” should be 
replaced with “Conjunctivitis and keratitis related events in AD patients”. Furthermore, in view of 
agreement from PRAC to include keratitis and ulcerative keratitis as ADRs in the EU SmPC sections 4.4 
and 4.8 (see last approved SmPC), the MAH proposes to re-classify “Conjunctivitis and keratitis related 
events in AD patients” from missing information to an important identified risk.” 
The MAH proposed the reclassification of “Conjunctivitis and keratitis related events in AD patients” 
from missing information to an important identified risk. As sufficient evidence has been accumulated 
to conclude that a causal relationship exists, and the events have been listed in the SmPC section 4.8, 
the proposed re-classification is justified. This safety concern will be further characterised in the 
ongoing additional PhV activity, namely in Ophthalmology substudy LTS14041 of R668-AD-1225, and 
therefore the safety concern should still remain in the RMP list of safety concerns. Therefore, MAH’s 
justification and the proposed new RMP list of safety concerns are endorsed. 
Conclusions on the safety specification  
Having considered the data in the safety specification the CHMP agreed that the safety concerns listed 
by the applicant are appropriate.

2.7.2.1.  Routine pharmacovigilance activities 
MAH reports the following routine PhV activities beyond adverse reactions reporting and signal 
detection:  
- 
Analysis of systemic hypersensitivity events in ongoing clinical studies: To detect any 
modifications in the risk characterization. 
-  Hypersensitivity questionnaire for systemic hypersensitivity (including events associated with 
immunogenicity) to collect data from healthcare professionals for serious hypersensitivity 
events received in post-marketing setting and detect any modifications in the risk 
characterization. 
- 
Pregnancy questionnaire for post-marketing events: To monitor pregnancy and infant 
outcomes in women exposed to commercially supplied dupilumab.

2.7.2.3.  Overall conclusions on the PhV Plan  
The routine PhV activities beyond adverse reactions reporting and signal detection have been agreed in 
previous processes of dupilumab, and no new routine activities are proposed in the current procedure, 
no changes are necessary. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, is of the opinion that the proposed post-
authorisation PhV development plan is sufficient to identify and characterise the risks of the product. 
The CHMP also considered that routine PhV remains sufficient to monitor the effectiveness of the risk 
minimisation measures.  
2.7.2.4.  Summary of Post authorisation efficacy development plan 
MAH states that no imposed post-authorization efficacy studies as a condition of the MA or which are 
specific obligations in the context of conditional MA or MA under exceptional circumstances are planned 
or ongoing for dupilumab.

2.7.3.3.  Discussion on risk minimisation measures 
Eosinophilia 
As per MAH’s protocol description, on-treatment eosinophil counts >3.0 Giga/L were to be reported as 
AEs, even if they were not associated with symptoms. An analysis on a selected grouping of 
“eosinophilia” TEAEs was performed, including the HLT “eosinophilic disorders” plus the PT “eosinophil 
count increased”. 
In EFC14153, the MAH reported that 6.6% (n=18) vs. 0.7% (n=1) experienced TEAE eosinophilia in 
the dupilumab group vs. placebo; 6 cases thereof in the dupilumab group were assessed as treatment-
related TEAE. According to MAH, most TEAEs of eosinophilia (16 out of 18) were self-limiting laboratory 
findings without any associated symptoms. Two patients, both in the dupilumab group, required 
corrective treatment. All patients except one recovered (1 was recovering). MAH reports that all events 
were mild to moderate and did not require treatment discontinuation, except for one patient, for whom 
the event was considered serious, severe in intensity and led to treatment discontinuation. MAH 
considered two events of eosinophilia as SAEs, both in the dupilumab group: One of them was 
associated with clinical symptoms (headache and dizziness [reported as blurred vision]), was severe 
and led to permanent treatment discontinuation; In the other event, the patient was hospitalized to 
rule out suspected parasitic infection, the IMP was continued, and the patient recovered.  
As per the MAH’s PSUR list of safety concerns, the MAH has included ‘eosinophilia associated with 
clinical symptoms in patients with asthma’ as an important potential risk; (not applicable to EU-RMP 
version 5.0 as per prior PRAC agreement). Therefore, the MAH has described, and is expected to 
Assessment report  
EMA/98744/2022  
Page 78/88 
 
 
 
 
 
continue to do so, the up-to-date risk characterization of eosinophilia across all approved indications in 
the PSUR submissions. The MAH has not reported a change in the characterization of this risk. 
As has been addressed in prior dupilumab MAA and extensions of indication in the adult AD and 
adult/adolescent asthma population, the transient increase in eosinophil counts during the first weeks 
of treatment is a known phenomenon caused by dupilumab treatment. Accordant and appropriate 
measures have been previously implemented in the RMP and SmPC in order to avert possible risks in 
patients with hyper-eosinophilic conditions. 
The current SmPC section 4.4 gives a warning in regard to clinically significant eosinophilia 
(pneumonia, vasculitis, EGPA) in adult patients in previous clinical studies. In the current application, 
the MAH has proposed to the CHMP to include in section 4.8 a statement describing that eosinophilia 
(blood eosinophils ≥ 3,000 cells/mcL or deemed by the investigator to be an adverse event) was 
reported in 6.6 % of the dupilumab groups and 0.7% in the placebo group of paediatric patients. 
Furthermore, within the current process information regard the adverse event of eosinophilia was 
included in SmPC 4.8 in the paediatric population. 
Parasitic infections (enterobiasis) 
In EFC14153, more dupilumab-treated patients experienced parasitic infections (2.6% (n=7) vs. 0% 
(n=0)). The most frequently reported parasitic infection was enterobiasis (5/7 patients). None of the 
events were considered as treatment-emergent SAEs by MAH and none resulted in permanent 
treatment discontinuation or were assessed by the Investigator as related to the IMP. Despite a lacking 
causal relationship by medical judgement, MAH has suggested the designation of an ADR for the SmPC 
based on the numerical imbalance of this controlled data. 
As per the MAH’s PSUR list of safety concerns, the MAH has included ’Helminthic infections’ as missing 
information (not applicable to EU-RMP version 5.0 as per prior PRAC agreement). Therefore, the MAH 
has described, and is expected to continue to do so, the up-to-date risk characterization of helminthic 
infections across all approved indications in the PSUR submissions. The MAH considers that data are 
missing for populations who reside in endemic regions for helminth infections, including children 
between the ages of 5 and 15 years who experience the highest rates of specific helminthic 
(roundworm, hookworm, and whipworm) infections. The MAH reports in the recently submitted PSUR 
(PSUSA/00010645/202103) that a review of clinical trial and post-marketing data up to the DLP of 28-
Mar-2021 identified no change in the characterization of this safety concern. 
The current SmPC section 4.4 gives a warning in regard to helminthic infections, and that patients with 
pre-existing helminth infections should be treated before initiating dupilumab. Further, the SmPC 
instructs that “If patients become infected while receiving treatment with dupilumab and do not 
respond to anti-helminth treatment, treatment with dupilumab should be discontinued until the 
infection resolves”. The MAH has now proposed to the CHMP addition of following information in section 
4.4 “Cases of enterobiasis were reported in children 6 to 11 years old who participated in the paediatric 
asthma development program”. Cross-reference is made to section 4.8. where the MAH has proposed 
addition of text “In children 6 to 11 years of age with moderate-to-severe asthma (VOYAGE), the 
additional adverse reactions of enterobiasis and eosinophilia were reported. Enterobiasis was reported 
in 1.8 % (5 patients) in the dupilumab groups and none in the placebo group. All enterobiasis cases 
were mild to moderate and patients recovered with anti-helminth treatment without dupilumab 
treatment discontinuation”. Of note and to be taken into consideration, the dupilumab SmPC section 
4.8 has recently been updated to replace ADR tables per indication with a consolidated table of ADRs 
across all approved indications (EMEA/H/C/004390/II/0039). 
In light of current knowledge and results, the risks of eosinophilia and parasitic infections can be 
appropriately addressed by routine RMMs, i.e. SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8, were updated according to 
Assessment report  
EMA/98744/2022

the consideration to reflect the current clinical trial findings. It is noted that the RMP no longer is a 
document describing the product and all the risks that may be associated with the product, but rather 
a planning tool for additional PhV activities and RMM. Neither additional PhV-activities nor additional 
RMMs have been considered necessary or have been planned for the topics of eosinophilia or parasitic 
infections in the past in the EU. The current results on the paediatric asthma patients do not for the 
time being change that consideration. Meanwhile, the MAH has been instructed in prior PSURs to 
continue to monitor these subjects by means of routine pharmacovigilance and report any concerns in 
future PSURs. No additional PhV activities or RMMs are deemed necessary in light of the present 
information. 
2.7.3.4.  Overall conclusions on risk minimisation measures 
The CHMP had considered the data submitted and was of the opinion that the proposed risk 
minimisation measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed indication. 
2.7.4.   Conclusion 
The CHMP considered that the risk management plan version 6.1 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
2.8.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the MAH fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.8.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood affecting over 8% of children in the United-
States (US), and over 9% of children in the European Union (EU), with a worldwide prevalence 
estimated at almost 12%. Over one-third of children with asthma in the US and Western Europe have 
a disease that can be characterized as moderate-to-severe, with around 19% of children having a 
disease characterized as moderate, and around 2% with severe disease.  
Asthma is a complex, heterogeneous disease that can affect persons of all ages. Asthma is 
characterized by chronic airway inflammation and variable expiratory airflow limitation that is often 
reversible. Symptoms vary over time and in intensity and can include wheezing, shortness of breath, 
chest tightness, and cough. Children with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma are at risk for 
future respiratory complications, including asthma exacerbations which can be life-threatening at 
times, and progressive lung function decline. These children are at increased risk for abnormal patterns 
of lung growth, including reductions in maximal lung function achieved or early decline in lung 
function. Progressive lung function decline can lead to fixed airflow obstruction or even the 
development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at a young age. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The primary goal of asthma management in children is to achieve the control of symptoms, optimize 
lung function, and to decrease or eliminate asthma exacerbations while balancing the potential side 
effects of therapy. In addition, management of childhood asthma aims to reduce the chronic underlying 
inflammation process that if left uncontrolled may lead to non-reversible airflow limitation. The GINA 
guidelines for the management of asthma in children age 6 to <12 years old centre on a stepwise 
approach to therapy, with incremental adjustments in controller therapy for each step (1-5) reflecting 
the frequency and extent of underlying symptoms. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the primary 
controller medication, and additional controllers include long-acting β2 agonists (LABAs), leukotriene 
receptor antagonists (LTRAs), or long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs). Short-acting beta-2 
agonists (SABA) are used as needed for rescue medication. Children meeting criteria for Step 4 and 5 
therapy experience symptoms most days, and standard of care treatment as of the GINA 2020 
includes medium-dose ICS plus a LABA, with other options including the combination of several 
controller therapies. For children uncontrolled with this approach, additional add-on therapy options at 
Step 5 include systemic corticosteroids (SCS), anti-IgE (omalizumab) for patients with moderate-to-
severe persistent IgE-mediated asthma, or anti-IL-5 (mepolizumab) for patients with elevated blood 
eosinophil counts.  
Inhaled corticosteroids and SCS carry known side effects, and therefore guidelines recommend using 
the minimum effective dose to maintain asthma control. While there is strong evidence that both ICS 
and SCS can prevent exacerbations and preserve lung function, there is little data to support added 
clinical benefit from increasing ICS above medium dose in children. In children, the long-term use of 
ICS can have negative impacts on growth, bone metabolism, and adrenal function. In addition to these 
adverse effects, short courses of SCS are additionally associated with acute mood changes and sleep 
disturbances. 
Assessment report  
EMA/98744/2022  
Page 81/88 
 
 
 
For paediatric patients with uncontrolled asthma, add-on therapies beyond the standard of care 
therapies are currently still limited. Mentioned targeted biologic therapies for treating IgE-mediated 
and eosinophilic asthma are intended for specific patient populations, or clinical efficacy has yet to be 
demonstrated in randomized-controlled trials. Predictors of good asthma response to dupilumab are 
higher blood eosinophils and FeNo.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Table 12 List of Phase 3 asthma pediatric (6 to ˂12 years) studies evaluated in the 
Summary of Clinical Safety and study status 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Compared with placebo, the annualized rate of severe exacerbation events during pivotal study 
EFC14153 was significantly reduced in patients assigned to both the dupilumab 100 mg Q2W and 200 
mg Q2W dupilumab groups of the pre-defined primary efficacy populations, i.e. 0.305 (dupilumab) vs. 
0.748 (placebo) (type 2 inflammatory asthma phenotype) and 0.235 (dupilumab) vs. 0.665 (placebo) 
(baseline blood eosinophils ≥0.3 Giga/L phenotype). The relative risk reduction versus placebo was 
59.3% and 64.7%, respectively. 
These results were consistent across all efficacy populations, i.e. 0.318 vs. 0.816 (dupilumab/placebo) 
in patients exhibiting blood eosinophils ≥0.15 Giga/L at baseline and 0.271 vs. 0.705 
(dupilumab/placebo) in those with baseline FeNO ≥20 ppb 0.271. 
The long-term efficacy of dupilumab is substantiated by the fact that the cumulative mean number of 
severe exacerbations, as well as the relative risk in annualized rate of severe exacerbation, were lower 
Assessment report  
EMA/98744/2022  
Page 82/88 
 
 
 
 
 
in the dupilumab-treated patients of all four biomarker-based efficacy populations compared to placebo 
over 52 treatment weeks.  
Consistent with these results, in dupilumab-treated patients the time-to-first severe exacerbation 
event was prolonged in all analysed efficacy populations.  
Efficacy was also demonstrated by a statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement (LS) 
mean change from baseline) in percent predicted pre-BD FEV1 at Week 12 in both primary efficacy 
populations, i.e. 10.53% (dupilumab) vs. 5.32% (placebo) (type 2 inflammatory asthma phenotype) 
and 10.15% (dupilumab) vs. 4.83% (placebo) (baseline blood eosinophils ≥0.3 Giga/L phenotype). 
These effects were maintained up to treatment week 52.  
Dupilumab’s clinical benefit is also reflected by significant change from baseline in Asthma Control 
Questionnaire (ACQ-7-IA) scores at Week 24 and in Paediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire 
Scores with Standardized Activities (PAQLQ(S)-IA) at Weeks 12, 24, 36, and 52, as well as reduction of 
the annualized rate of loss of asthma control events (LOAC).  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Regarding the gender, the adjusted annualized severe exacerbation event rate was lower for males 
and females assigned to the dupilumab treatment groups of both primary efficacy populations 
compared to the placebo groups. The effect for females was lower compared to males, most likely due 
to a lower exacerbation rate in the female placebo subgroup and sample size imbalances with regards 
to gender. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Pivotal Phase 3 study EFC14153: 
A higher TEAE frequency in the verum group was observed for SOCs ‘Blood and lymphatic system 
disorders’ (8.5% vs. 3.0%) and ‘Gastrointestinal disorders’ (14.8% vs. 9.7%). At PT level, 
‘eosinophilia’ and ‘injection site reactions’ occurred more often in the dupilumab treatment group. More 
cases of parasitic infections such as enterobiasis were reported in the verum group (2.6% vs. 0.7%). 
The following drug-related TEAEs occurred more often in the dupilumab group (PT level): ‘Injection site 
erythema’ (12.9% vs. 9.7%), ‘injection site edema’ (10.3% vs. 5.2%), ‘injection site nodule’ (6.3% 
versus 2.2%), ‘injection site pain’ (1.8% versus 1.5%), ‘eosinophilia’ (1.8% versus 0), and ‘headache' 
(1.5% versus 0.7%). Single cases of ascariasis, enterobiasis, hordeolum, pulmonary tuberculosis, rash 
and headache were deemed related to the IMP.  
Two SAEs of pneumonia and eosinophilia with headache and blurred vision were assessed as possibly 
related to dupilumab.  
Numerical differences of AESI were observed at PT levels ‘Injection site reactions’ (17.7% DUP vs. 
13.4% PLC) and ‘eosinophilia’ (6.6% DUP vs. 0.7% PLC). Regarding the subgroup analysis, more 
patients ≤30 kg bw experienced parasitic infections (5.5% vs. 1.1%) and eosinophilia (9.9% vs. 5.0%) 
than those ≥ 30 kg bw. Conversely, injection site reactions occurred more often within the higher 
weight class (20.0% vs. 13.2%).  
Open-label extension study LTS14424: 
During study LTS14424, overall, 55.1% patients experienced at least 1 TEAE and 12.9% were 
assessed as possibly related to dupilumab. Generally, patients that had received dupilumab in the 
parent study reported TEAEs less frequently (50.8% vs. 63.2%). Single cases of ascariasis, 
Assessment report  
EMA/98744/2022  
Page 83/88 
 
 
 
enterobiasis, hordeolum, pulmonary tuberculosis, rash and headache were deemed related to the IMP. 
Most related TEAEs were reported for PTs ‘Injection site reaction’ (4.4%), ‘Injection site erythema’ 
(2.2%), ‘Injection site nodule’ (1.4%), ‘Accidental overdose’ (1.6%) and ‘Eosinophilia’ (1.1%).  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of dupilumab is well-characterized, also in the targeted disease, and no new safety 
concerns were observed in the pivotal study.

3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Results of the pivotal Phase 3 study EFC14153 show that dupilumab-treated paediatric patients aged 
6-11 years with severe type 2 asthma had significantly lower rates of severe asthma exacerbations 
than those who received placebo and these results were substantiated by long-term data coming from 
study LTS14424.  
Moreover, dupilumab improved lung function as measured by changes in pre-bronchodilator FEV1. The 
results were consistent in the primary pre-specified efficacy populations defined by type 2 biomarkers. 
The patient reported outcomes showed an improvement in quality of life of the patient population. 
Consistency of the results was demonstrated for the different dose groups (100/200 mg q2w and 300 
mg q4w) regarding all efficacy endpoints and additional spirometric parameters that were added to the 
SmPC upon request. Note that efficacy and safety results were regarding the 300 mg q4w are based 
on uncontrolled data of 18 patients. This dose regimen, however, is already approved for AD patients 
≥15 kg bw. 
The most relevant safety concerns associated with dupilumab treatment identified during the 
development programs are related to immunogenicity and associated (systemic) hypersensitivity 
reactions, infections, eosinophilia and related conditions, eye disorders, injection site reactions, 
parasitic infection, risk of malignancy, as well as uncertainties about the impact of dupilumab on

pregnancies and their outcomes. These risks are commented below, mainly based on analyses of the 
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI): 
During EFC14153 study, slightly more patients assigned to the dupilumab 200 mg Q2W group (>30 
kg) had treatment-emergent ADA response compared with the patients treated with 100 mg Q2W 
(≤30 kg) and with placebo. Persistent ADA responses were balanced across the dupilumab groups and 
ADA response gradually decreased over time. There was no apparent pattern or increase in TEAE 
incidence in the ADA-positive patients compared with the ADA-negative patients; no anaphylactic 
reaction, hypersensitivity or injection sire reactions occurred in patients with neutralizing antibodies. 
Thus, the immunogenic risk associated with dupilumab remains low.  
Events of hypersensitivity reactions occurred at a lower frequency in the dupilumab group of the 
pivotal study EFC14153 and only one event of moderate drug hypersensitivity in the dupilumab group 
was considered serious and led to treatment discontinuation. No anaphylactic reaction was observed in 
the verum group. Thus, the risk for developing hypersensitivity or anaphylactic events seems to be low 
under dupilumab treatment in the paediatric asthma population.  
Similarly, dupilumab seems not to increase the risk for infections in general. The overall rate was lower 
in the dupilumab treated patients compared with the placebo group. Most TEAEs were mild-to-
moderate and considered unrelated to the study drug. Results were similar in the open-label extension 
study. 
As to injection site reactions (ISR), the following drug related TEAEs occurred more often in the 
dupilumab group during EFC141453 study. During study LTS14424, most related TEAEs were reported 
for PTs Injection site reaction, Injection site erythema and Injection site nodule, no severe or serious 
ISR occurred.  
Eosinophilia was reported more frequently in the dupilumab group and again more frequently in 
children with baseline weight ≤30 kg. 2 events in the verum group were considered serious, one 
thereof was associated with headache and dizziness, assessed as related to dupilumab and lead to 
treatment discontinuation. The frequency decreased over time. Eosinophilia is a known ADR and listed 
in section 4.8 of the SmPC; no update of the frequency was considered necessary. 
More dupilumab-treated patients experienced parasitic infections. The most frequently reported 
parasitic infection was enterobiasis. None of the events were considered as treatment-emergent SAEs 
and none resulted in permanent treatment discontinuation or were assessed by the Investigator as 
related to the IMP.  
Eye disorders and especially conjunctivitis (narrow and broad) were reported less frequently in the 
dupilumab group when compared with the placebo group. 
No event of malignancy was identified. 
These results are consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent and corresponding ADRs are 
reflected in the PI.  
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
For paediatric patients with uncontrolled asthma, add-on therapies beyond the standard of care 
therapies are currently still limited. Considering the efficacy and safety results, the CHMP is of the 
opinion that the favourable effects outweigh the unfavourable effects. The benefit-risk balance is 
positive and the same as the one observed in the adolescent and adult populations.

3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Dupixent is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
POSITIVE OPINION  
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality and safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by 
consensus that the benefit-risk balance of Dupixent 100 mg solution for injection is favourable in the 
following indication: 
Treatment of Asthma in children from 6 to 11 years old as add-on maintenance treatment for severe 
asthma with type 2 inflammation characterised by raised blood eosinophils and/or raised fraction of 
exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) who are inadequately controlled with medium to high dose ICS plus 
another medicinal product for maintenance treatment. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension(s) of the marketing authorisation for Dupixent subject 
to the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
•  Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and 
interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and 
any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
to be implemented by the Member States. 
Not applicable.

Paediatric Data  
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0404/2020 and the results of these studies are reflected in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet. 
In addition, CHMP recommends the variations to the terms of the marketing authorisation concerning 
the following changes: 
Variations requested 
Type 
Annexes

one 
Adopted scope: 
Extension application to add a new strength of 100 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe with 
safety system (PFS-S) grouped with a type II variation (C.I.6.a) to include the treatment of asthma in 
children from 6 to 11 years old as add-on maintenance treatment for severe asthma with type 2 
inflammation characterised by raised blood eosinophils and/or raised fraction of exhaled nitric oxide 
(FeNO), who are inadequately controlled with medium to high dose ICS plus another medicinal product 
for maintenance treatment. 
As a consequence, SmPC sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 have been updated and the Package 
Leaflet has been updated accordingly. Furthermore, the PI is brought in line with the latest QRD 
template version 10.2 Rev1.The RMP has been amended (version 6.1).

1.  Introduction 
Study  VX13-809-011  (Study  011)  was  submitted  under  Article  46  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  1901/2006 
(the ‘Paediatric Regulation’). There were two parts in the study: Part A & Part B.  
Part A: A Phase 1, Open-Label Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics (PK) and Safety of Lumacaftor 
in Combination with Ivacaftor in Subjects 6 through 11 Years of Age with Cystic Fibrosis, Homozygous 
for the F508del-CFTR Mutation, was initiated on 12 July 2013 and completed on 25 October 2013. Ten 
patients received at least 1 dose of LUM/IVA (LUM 200 mg/IVA 250 mg q12h) for 14 days. 
Part  B:  A  Phase  3,  Open-Label  Study  to  Evaluate  the  Pharmacokinetics,  Safety  and  Tolerability  of 
Lumacaftor in Combination  with  Ivacaftor in  Subjects 6 through 11 Years of  Age with  Cystic Fibrosis, 
Homozygous  for  the  F508del-CFTR  Mutation,  was  added  in  September  2013,  initiated  on  15  January 
2015,  and  completed  on  28  October  2015.  Fifty-eight  patients  received  at  least  1  dose  of  LUM/IVA 
(LUM 200 mg/IVA 250 mg q12h) for 24 weeks. 
Study  011  Part  A  was  included  in  the  original LUM/IVA  paediatric  investigation  plan  (PIP)  and  results 
were  reviewed  by  the  Paediatric  Committee  (PDCO)  in  the  PIP  compliance  check  (C1-001582-PIP01-
13), which was confirmed on 14 November 2014 (EMA/604209/2014). 
Study 011 Part B was not included in the original LUM/IVA PIP. Results from both Parts A and B were 
submitted to the PDCO on 4 April 2016 with LUM/IVA PIP Modification 4 (EMEA-001582-PIP01-13-M04) 
for supporting the initiation of Study VX15-809-115 (PIP Study 15), a safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) 
study evaluating LUM/IVA in subjects 2 through 5 years of age, with cystic fibrosis (CF), homozygous 
for  F508del,  which  was  initiated  in  the  USA  already.  The  PDCO  was  not  able  to  agree  with  the  dose 
proposed,  because  Study  VX14-809-109  was  still  ongoing,  and  the  validity  of  pop  PK  model  and  the 
body weight distribution for children with CF aged 2-6 years were not fully clarified. The discussion in 
the PDCO will continue in 2017. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
Information on the development program 
Orkambi™ (LUM 200 mg/IVA 125 mg FDC tablet) was approved in the European Union (EU) through a 
centralized  procedure  on  19  November  2015  for  the  treatment  of  CF  in  patients  aged  12  years  and 
older with a homozygous F508del mutation in the CFTR gene.  
The Applicant continued the development program in patients aged 6-11 years. In addition to Study 
011, two other studies targeted the same population: 
-  Study VX14-809-109 (Study 109; study completed, data analysis ongoing): a Phase 3, double-
blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LUM/IVA 
combination therapy in subjects 6 through 11 years of age with CF, homozygous for F508del. 
Study 109 enrolled more than 200 subjects; subjects were administered LUM 200 mg/IVA 250 
mg q12h for 24 weeks. 
-  Study VX15-809-110 (Study 110; ongoing): a Phase 3 rollover study to evaluate the safety 
and efficacy of long-term treatment with LUM/IVA combination therapy in subjects aged 6 
years and older with CF, homozygous for F508del. Study 110 has enrolled subjects from 
Studies 011 Part B and 109. Subjects are administered LUM 200 mg/IVA 250 mg q12h 
(subjects 6 through 11 years of age) or LUM 400 mg/IVA 250 mg q12h (subjects 12 years of 
age and older) for 96 weeks.

Page 4/50 
 
 
 
 
The Applicant intends to submit a Line Extension to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in Q2 2017 
to extend the current indication to include CF patients aged 6 through 11 years, homozygous for 
F508del, with new tablet strength (LUM 100 mg/IVA 125 mg FDC tablets). The extension of this 
indication will be supported by final results from Studies 011 and 109, and interim analysis results 
from Study 110. 
Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Subjects in Studies 011 received LUM 200 mg/IVA 250 mg q12h. 
- 
Part A: lumacaftor (LUM) 200-mg/ivacaftor (IVA) 125-mg fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet 
+ IVA 125-mg tablet 
- 
Part B: LUM 100 mg/IVA 125-mg FDC tablet 
For completeness, a summary of the LUM/IVA and IVA formulations used in Studies 011, 109, and 110 
is provided in Table 1: 
Pharmacokinetics 
There is no clinically relevant difference in PK parameters for lumacaftor or ivacaftor between males 
and female subjects. 
•  Absorption 
After twice-daily dosing, steady-state plasma concentrations of lumacaftor and ivacaftor were 
generally reached after approximately 7 days of treatment. The steady-state exposure of 
ivacaftor is lower than that of Day 1 due to the CYP3A induction effect of lumacaftor. 
Following multiple oral doses of lumacaftor, the exposure of lumacaftor generally increased 
proportional to dose over the range of 50 mg to 1000 mg every 24 hours. The exposure of 
lumacaftor increased approximately 2.0-fold when given with fat-containing food relative to 
fasted conditions.  
CHMP assessment report for paediatric studies submitted in accordance with article 46 
of regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended  
Orkambi 
Page 5/50 
 
 
 
 
 
Following multiple oral dose administration of ivacaftor in combination with lumacaftor, the 
exposure of ivacaftor generally increased with dose from 150 mg every 12 hours to 250 mg 
every 12 hours. The exposure of ivacaftor when given in combination with lumacaftor 
increased approximately 3-fold when given with fat-containing food. 
•  Distribution 
Lumacaftor is approximately 99% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to albumin.  
Ivacaftor is approximately 99% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to alpha 1-acid 
glycoprotein and albumin.  
•  Biotransformation 
Lumacaftor is not extensively metabolised in humans, with the majority of lumacaftor excreted 
unchanged in the faeces.  
Ivacaftor is extensively metabolised in humans, primarily by hepatic CYP3A. M1 and M6 are the 
two major metabolites of ivacaftor in humans. M1 has approximately one-sixth the potency of 
ivacaftor and is considered pharmacologically active. M6 has less than one-fiftieth the potency 
of ivacaftor and is not considered pharmacologically active. 
• 
Elimination 
Following oral administration of lumacaftor, the majority of lumacaftor (51%) is excreted 
unchanged in the faeces. There was negligible urinary excretion of lumacaftor as unchanged 
drug. The apparent terminal half-life is approximately 26 hours.  
Following oral administration of ivacaftor, the majority of ivacaftor (87.8%) is eliminated in the 
faeces after metabolic conversion. There was negligible urinary excretion of ivacaftor as 
unchanged drug. In healthy subjects, the half-life of ivacaftor when given with lumacaftor is 
approximately 9 hours.  
•  Hepatic impairment 
Following multiple doses of lumacaftor/ivacaftor for 10 days, subjects with moderately 
impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh Class B, score 7 to 9) had higher exposures (AUC0-12hr 
by approximately 50% and Cmax by approximately 30%) compared with healthy subjects 
matched for demographics. 
Pharmacodynamics 
• 
Effects on Sweat Chloride: 
Changes in sweat chloride in response to lumacaftor alone or in combination with ivacaftor 
were evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with CF 
age 18 years and older. In this trial, 10 patients (homozygous for F508del-CFTR mutation) 
completed dosing with lumacaftor alone 400 mg q12h for 28 days followed by the addition of 
ivacaftor 250 mg q12h for an additional 28 days, and 25 patients (homozygous or 
heterozygous for F508del) completed dosing with placebo. The treatment difference between 
lumacaftor 400 mg q12h alone and placebo evaluated as mean change in sweat chloride from 
baseline to Day 28 was statistically significant at -8.2 mmol/L (95% CI: -14, -2). The 
treatment difference between the combination of lumacaftor 400 mg/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h 
and placebo evaluated as mean change in sweat chloride from baseline to Day 56 was 
statistically significant at -11 mmol/L (95% CI: -18, -4).

•  Changes in FEV1: 
The treatment difference between lumacaftor 400 mg q12h alone and placebo evaluated as 
mean absolute change in ppFEV1 was -4.6 percentage points (95% CI: -9.6, 0.4) from 
baseline to Day 28, 4.2 percentage points (95% CI: –1.3, 9.7) from baseline to Day 56, and 
7.7 percentage points (95% CI: 2.6, 12.8; statistically significant) from Day 28 to Day 56. 
•  Decrease in Heart Rate 
During the 24-week, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 studies, a maximum decrease in mean heart 
rate of 6 beats per minute (bpm) from baseline was observed on Day 1 and Day 15 around 4 
to 6 hours after dosing. From Week 4, the change in mean heart rate at pre-dose ranged from 
1 to 2 bpm below baseline among patients treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor. The percentage 
of patients with heart rate values <50 bpm on treatment was 11% for patients who received 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor, compared to 4.9% for patients who received placebo. 
Safety 
Orkambi is generally well tolerated; the most frequently reported adverse events by patients aged 12 
years and older in the pooled, placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies, were dyspnoea (14.0% versus 7.8% 
on placebo), diarrhoea (11.0% versus 8.4% on placebo), and nausea (10.2% versus 7.6% on placebo). 
Serious adverse reactions occurring in at least 0.5% of patients included hepatobiliary events, e.g., 
transaminase elevations, cholestatic hepatitis and hepatic encephalopathy. 
•  Hepatic Events 
During the 24-week, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 studies, the incidence of maximum 
transaminase (ALT or AST) levels >8, >5, and >3 x ULN were 0.8%, 2.0%, and 5.2% in 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor treated patients vs. 0.5%, 1.9%, and 5.1% in placebo-treated patients. 
The incidence of transaminase-related adverse reactions was 5.1% vs. 4.6% in 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor vs. placebo. Following discontinuation of lumacaftor/ivacaftor, liver 
function tests returned to baseline or improved substantially in all patients. 
•  Respiratory Events 
During the 24-week, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 studies, the incidence of respiratory adverse 
reactions (e.g., chest discomfort, dyspnoea, and respiration abnormal) was 26.3% vs, 17.0% 
in lumacaftor/ivacaftor vs. placebo. Approximately three-quarters of the events began during 
the first week of treatment, and in most patients the events resolved without dosing 
interruption.  
•  Cardiovascular Events 
During the 24-week, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 studies, adverse reactions related to 
increased blood pressure (BP) (e.g., hypertension, BP increased) were reported in 0.9% 
(7/738) of patients treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor vs. none who received placebo.

To evaluate the PK of multiple doses of lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor 
Secondary: 
- 
- 
To investigate the PK of a lumacaftor metabolite, M28 (M28-lumacaftor), and ivacaftor 
metabolites, M1 and M6 (M1-ivacaftor and M6-ivacaftor) 
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of lumacaftor in combination with 
ivacaftor 
Part B 
Primary:  
- 
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor through 
Week 24. 
Secondary:  
- 
- 
- 
To evaluate the PD of lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor through Week 24 
To evaluate the off-drug response after the Washout Period (Week 24 to Week 26) 
To evaluate the PK of lumacaftor, M28-lumacaftor, ivacaftor, M1-ivacaftor, and M6-ivacaftor for 
lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor 
Study design 
This was a 2-part (Part A and Part B), open-label, multicenter study that evaluated the PK, safety, 
tolerability, and PD of multiple doses of LUM/IVA in subjects 6 through 11 years of age (inclusive) with 
CF who are homozygous for the F508del-CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutation. 
Part A 
Screening Visit assessments were completed at any time during the period of 4 weeks (Day -28 
through Day -1) before the first dose of the study drug (Day 1). During the Treatment Period, subjects 
were administered LUM 200 mg every 12 hours (q12h)/IVA 250 mg q12h for 14 days. A Safety Follow-
up Visit was scheduled to occur 10 (± 4) days after the last dose of study drug. 
Part A evaluated PK, safety, and tolerability for 14 days. Primary endpoints of Part A were LUM and IVA 
PK parameters, including maximum observed concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration 
versus time curve from time of dosing to time tau (AUC0-τ). Based on confirmation of safety and 
adequate exposure (i.e., comparable exposure with subjects 12 years of age and older) with LUM 200 
mg/IVA 250 mg q12h in Part A, this dose regimen was selected for Part B.

Part B 
Screening Visit assessments were completed at any time during the period of 4 weeks (Day -28 
through Day -1) before the first dose of study drug (Day 1). During the Treatment Period, subjects 
were administered LUM 200 mg q12h/IVA 250 mg q12h for 24 weeks. A 2-week Washout Period (Week 
24 ± 5 days to Week 26 ± 3 days) was included in order to evaluate the off-drug response.  
Primary endpoints for Part B were safety and tolerability assessments based on adverse events (AEs), 
clinical laboratory values (serum chemistry, hematology, coagulation studies, and urinalysis), standard 
12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital signs, pulse oximetry, ophthalmological examinations, and 
spirometry.
An independent data monitoring committee (DMC) was formed using the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation 
Data Safety Monitoring Board. The DMC objectives and operational details were defined in a separate 
document (DMC Charter), which was finalized before the first subject is enrolled in Part B of the study.

of regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended  
Orkambi 
Page 9/50 
 
 
 
 
The DMC conducted one review of the study safety data, with the same data snapshot date as the one 
used for the interim analysis. Details of the DMC analysis followed IA Analysis as provided in the IA 
Analysis Plan Version 2 (dated Aug. 26, 2015). 
An interactive web response system (IWRS) was used to assign subject identification numbers and 
manage drug supply at the site. From the time of subject identification number assignment, and 
throughout the duration of the study, subjects were identified by their initials and assigned subject 
identification number.  
Subjects and their legally appointed and authorized representative (e.g., parent or legal guardian) 
should not have been informed of their study-related spirometry and LCI (Part B only) results during 
the Treatment Period, regardless of whether the subject permanently discontinued treatment.   
Statistical Assessor's Comment:   
The involvement of DCM to monitor safety is endorsed.  The Applicant is requested to provide the 
minutes from the DCM meeting. 
The strategies used by the Applicant to minimise bias are acknowledged. 
Study population  
Subjects who are homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation (genotype was confirmed at the 
Screening Visit) in Part A may wish to participate in Part B. 
Key exclusion criteria: 
-  Subjects with a history of any illness or condition that could confound study results or pose an 
additional safety risk. 
-  Subjects with protocol-defined laboratory values indicative of abnormal liver function or 
abnormal renal function. 
Abnormal liver function was defined as any 3 or more of the following: 
Part A only  
≥3 × upper limit of normal (ULN) aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 
≥3 × ULN alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
≥3 × ULN gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase 
≥3 × ULN alkaline phosphatase 
≥2 × ULN total bilirubin

Part B only  
ALT or AST >5 × ULN, or bilirubin >2 × ULN 
Sample Size and Power 
Part A 
•  No formal sample size calculations; the size is deemed adequate to meet the PK objectives. 
Part B 
•  With a total sample size of 50 subjects completed, there is a 92.3% chance of observing AEs in 
at least 1 subject if the true incidence rate is 5%, and a 99.5% chance of observing AEs in at 
least 1 subject if the true incidence rate is 10%. The probabilities are binomial, determined 
based on expected availability of subjects at the sites with the capability of assessing LCI.  
Statistical Assessor's Comment:   
The strategy used to determine sample size is in line with the primary objective of Part B of the study. 
Treatments 
Part A 
LUM 200 mg q12h/IVA 250 mg q12h (1 × LUM 200-mg/IVA 125-mg fixed-dose tablet [lot B13030] 
q12h + 1 × IVA 125-mg tablet [lot 3106243R] q12h) was administered orally. 
Part B 
LUM 200 mg q12h/IVA 250 mg q12h (2 × LUM 100-mg/IVA 125-mg fixed-dose tablet [lot 6041337] 
q12h) was administered orally.

Part B 
Primary Endpoint 
-  Safety and tolerability assessments based on adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory values, 
standard 12-lead ECGs, vital signs, pulse oximetry, ophthalmological examinations, and 
spirometry 
Secondary Endpoints 
-  Average absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride at Day 15 and at Week 4 
-  Absolute change from baseline in body mass index (BMI) and BMI-for-age z-score at Week 24 
- 
PK parameters of lumacaftor, M28-lumacaftor, ivacaftor, M1-ivacaftor, and M6-ivacaftor 
-  Absolute change from baseline in weight and weight-for-age z-score at Week 24 
-  Absolute change from baseline in height and height-for-age z-score at Week 24 
-  Absolute change from baseline in Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) respiratory 
domain score at Week 24 
-  Absolute change from baseline in Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) 
domains at Week 24 
-  Absolute change in sweat chloride from Week 24 at Week 26 
Sweat samples were sent to a central laboratory for testing and interpretation of results. Individual 
sweat chloride test results were not to be disclosed to the study sites. Specific instructions for 
collection, handling, processing, and shipping of sweat chloride samples to the central laboratory were 
provided separately. The sweat chloride test must have been conducted pre-dose relative to the 
morning dose of study drug during the Treatment Period. At each time point, 2 samples were collected, 
1 sample from each arm (left and right). Of the 2 measurements, only the sweat chloride value 
obtained from a sample volume ≥15 μL was included in any analysis. If a subject has replicated 
measurements at a post-baseline time point, then the median of the values was used in data analyses. 
The sweat chloride results for the left and right arms were averaged and used in the analysis, if the 
sweat chloride values for the left and right arms were both ≥15 μL; if only 1 arm is ≥15 μL, then only 
that value will be used. The baseline was defined as the average of the measurements at screening 
and on Day 1 pre-dose. 
The z-score for BMI, weight, and height were calculated using Centre for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) growth charts. 
To calculate the score for each domain, the response scores on the negatively phrased questions were 
reversed (reversed scores = 5 – response scores). Therefore, 1 always represents the worst condition 
and 4 always represents the best condition. In each domain, in cases where individual questions were 
skipped, the missing scores were imputed with the mean score of the non-missing questions for that 
domain rounded to the nearest integer. The scaled score for each domain ranges from 0 (worst 
condition) to 100 (best condition). 
Statistical Assessor's Comment:   
The use of central laboratory for assessment of sweat is endorsed, especially given the open label 
nature of the study design. When replicate measurements are available, the Applicant is requested to 
use the worst values rather the median values in the analysis.

Sampling  
PK Assessments 
Part A 
For the evaluation of plasma concentrations of LUM, M28-LUM, IVA, M1-IVA, and M6-IVA, blood 
samples were collected from all subjects as follows:

Part B 
For the evaluation of plasma concentrations of LUM, M28-LUM, IVA, M1-IVA, and M6-IVA, blood 
samples were collected from all subjects as follows: 
• Day 1 and Week 4: before the morning dose and 3 to 6 hours after the morning dose 
• Day 15: any time 3 to 6 hours after the morning dose 
• Week 16: before the morning dose 
• Week 24: collected at the same time as other blood collections 
Statistical Methods 
Pharmacokinetics: 
Part A and Part B 
Phoenix® WinNonlin® Professional Edition Version 5.3 or higher, located on the validated Citrix 
Production Server, was used for evaluating drug concentrations and generating PK parameters. PK 
analyses were performed on the entire population given a dose of LUM, whether the subject completed 
dosing or not and if the dataset(s) supported those analyses. PK parameters were determined using 
standard non-compartmental analysis (NCA). 
Pharmacodynamics (Part B only): 
PD analyses were performed using the FAS for the following secondary PD endpoints:

(1)  average absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride at Day 15 and at Week 4;  
(2)  absolute change from baseline in BMI and BMI-for-age z-score at Week 24;  
(3)  absolute change from baseline in weight and weight-for-age z-score at Week 24;  
(4)  absolute change from baseline in height and height-for-age z-score at Week 24;  
(5)  absolute change from baseline in CFQ-R respiratory domain score at Week 24;  
(6)  absolute change from baseline in TSQM domains at Week 24; and  
(7)  absolute change in sweat chloride from Week 24 at Week 26. 
The analysis for the average absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride at Day 15 and at Week 4 
is based on a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM), including absolute change from baseline in 
sweat chloride as the dependent variable (including all measurements up to Week 24 [inclusive], both 
on-treatment measurements and measurements after treatment discontinuation), visit as fixed effects, 
with adjustment for sex (male versus female), baseline weight group (< median versus ≥ median), 
and percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (ppFEV1) severity at screening (<90, and 
≥90); baseline sweat chloride as a covariate; and subject as a random effect. The primary result 
obtained from the model was the average treatment effect at Day 15 and at Week 4. 
Analyses for other PD endpoints are based on similar MMRMs, with the baseline sweat chloride 
replaced by baseline of the corresponding variable. For the analysis of BMI, weight, and their z-scores, 
the MMRM models remove the baseline weight group from the covariates.  
The absolute change in sweat chloride from Week 24 at Week 26 was analyzed using a linear 
regression. The regression model included the absolute change in sweat chloride from Week 24 at 
Week 26 as the dependent variable; with adjustment for sex (male versus female), baseline weight 
group (< median versus ≥ median), and ppFEV1 severity at screening (<90, and ≥90); and sweat 
chloride at Week 24 as a covariate. 
Statistical Assessor's Comment: 
The use of MMRM model is appropriate for analysing longitudinal data as it accounts for the 
correlations within subjects and allow unequal number of observations per subject. However, the 
issues of how missing data were handled in these analyses should be explored, as the MMRM model 
assumes data that are missing are missing at random. This assumption cannot be checked but it is 
possible to conduct alternative analyses that do not make this assumption, for example by imputing 
missing data using the baseline observation carried forward (BOCF) and see if the conclusions drawn 
from these analyses are similar to this analysis. Given the very low number of missing data in this 
study, additional analyses are unlikely to change the study conclusion. 
The inclusion of prognostic variable in the model enhances precision and is therefore supported. 
The Applicant is requested to explain why the change from baseline to Day 15 and Week 4 was 
calculated using the average of Day 15 and Week 4.   
Exploratory LCI Analyses (Part B only) 
The analyses of LCI (LCI2.5 and LCI5.0) are based on MMRMs similar to the primary analysis for sweat 
chloride, replacing baseline sweat chloride with baseline LCI.  
Subgroup analysis  
Subgroup analyses were performed for the following groups:

Safety: 
For both Part A & Part B 
Safety analyses were performed for the Safety Set. Only a descriptive analysis of safety was performed. 
Rapporteur’s Comments 
This is a PK/dose and safety study to be followed by -  Study VX14-809-109 (Study 109; study 
completed, data analysis ongoing): a Phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. 
Neither Part A nor Part B was an efficacy-confirmatory study.  
The eligibility criteria seemed to allow patients who completed Part A to continue Part B, though the 
long-term safety profile in the target population was not yet defined. Further, it is not clear why the 
exclusion criterion based on hepatic transaminase was less stringent in Part B than in Part A. It is not 
clear why Part B was not included in the PIP, given the PIP compliance check was conducted in 2014.  
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Part A 
A total of 10 subjects, including 5 aged 6 through 8 years and 5 aged 9 through 11 years, were 
enrolled, completed dosing and the study. These 10 subjects were included in all Data Sets. 
Part B 
A total of 58 subjects were enrolled from 20 sites in North America, with 54 (93.1%) subjects 
completing treatment and completing the study.

The Full Analysis Set (FAS) and the Safety Set included all 58 enrolled subjects exposed to any 
quantity of study drug. The PK Set included 57 enrolled subjects for whom the primary PK data were 
considered to be sufficient and interpretable.  
A total of 30 subjects were enrolled in the LCI Sub-study, exposed to study drug, with 28 (93.3%) 
subjects completing treatment and 27 (90.0%) subjects completing the study. 
Statistical Assessor's Comment:  
Only 7% (4/58) who received treatment withdrew prior to Week 24. 
There were 7 subjects with important protocol deviations during Part B of the study. The impact of 
these deviations on the assessment of secondary endpoints should be investigated.

Baseline data 
Part A 
The median weight across all 10 subjects was 26.50 kg at baseline. 
The mean FEV1 and ppFEV1 values across all 10 subjects were 1.521 L and 89.42 at baseline. 
• 
• 
Part B 
•  Subjects enrolled were male (27 [46.6%] subjects) and female (31 [53.4%] subjects). All 
subjects were White.  
• 
• 
• 
The median age was 9 years (range: 6 to 12 years) with 22 (37.9%) subjects <9 years of 
age and 36 (62.1%) subjects ≥9 years of age.  
The median weight was 30.6 kg (range: 18.2 to 57.0 kg) with 28 subjects < median 
weight and 30 subjects ≥ median weight.  
The mean values were 105.9 mmol/L (sweat chloride), 91.4 (ppFEV1), 16.89 kg/m2 
(BMI), 0.01 (BMI z-score), -0.03 (weight z-score), and 0.03 (height z-score).  
•  A total of 25 (43.1%) subjects were positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa at baseline. 
PHARMACOKINETIC EVALUATION 
Part A 
• 
The PK Set contained data for 10 subjects. 
•  Day 1 pre-dose samples from one Subject and another Subject and Day 7 pre-dose samples 
from a different Subject were excluded from the calculation due to the PK samples being taken 
after the dose was administered. The samples were included for the NCA using the actual 
sampling time.  
• 
The Day 14, 4-hour time point value from one Subject and the Day 14, 12-hour time point 
value for another Subject were missing because the subjects did not have a PK sample drawn 
at the specified time points on Day 14.

Rapporteur’s Comments 
It is agreed that the concentrations of lumacaftor (LUM) following a LUM 100 mg/IVA 125-mg FDC 
tablet q12h in Subjects 6 through 11 Years of Age with Cystic Fibrosis (Part B) appear comparable to 
concentrations in observed in adolescents and adult subjects with cystic fibrosis administered LUM 400 
mg q12h/IVA 250 mg q12h. For ivacaftor (IVA) steady state levels appear to be higher in the Part B 
study compared to the pooled data from study 103 and 104.  
Similar to previous studies, decreases in the levels of IVA due to induction by LUM were observed. 
It is recommended to pool these data with the data from other studies into a population PK model in 
order to support a line extension.

Sweat Chloride 
A reductions in sweat chloride was seen as early as Day 15, i.e., -19.7 mmol/L (P<0.0001), and 
seemed to sustain through Week 24, i.e., -24.8 mmol/L (P<0.0001). Following a 2-week Washout 
Period, there was a complete reversal at Week 26, i.e., -3.1 (10.4) mmol/L. 
Nutritional Status 
Increases in BMI and weight were seen as early as Day 15 and continued through the study period. 
The mean absolute change from baseline at Week 24 was 0.64 kg/m2 (P<0.0001) for BMI and 0.15 
(P<0.0001) for BMI-for-age z-score. The mean absolute change from baseline at Week 24 was 2.6 kg 
(P<0.0001) for weight and 0.13 (P<0.0001) for weight-for-age z-score. 
Increases in height were seen at Week 24, i.e., 2.9 cm (P<0.0001) for height and 0.03 (P = 0.2249) 
for height-for-age z-score. 
The mean (SD) absolute changes from baseline at the Week 26 Safety Follow-up Visit were 0.58 (0.66) 
kg/m2 (BMI), 0.11 (0.28) (BMI-for-age z-score), 2.6 (1.5) kg (weight), 0.11 (0.22) (weight-for-age z-

the 2-week Washout Period, ppFEV1 values returned to baseline, i.e., the mean absolute change from 
Week 24 to Week 26 was -3.2 percentage points (P = 0.0003).

A favourable change in the CFQ-R respiratory domain score was seen at Week 24, i.e., 5.4 points (P = 
0.0085). 
A favorable trend for changes in the TSQM domains was seen at Week 24, i.e., 9.2 points (P = 0.0005) 
for the effectiveness domain, -0.3 points (P = 0.5270) for the side effects domain, 11.1 points 
(P<0.0001) for the convenience domain, and 3.6 points (P = 0.2018) for the global satisfaction 
domain.  
Exploratory LCI Substudy 
A reduction in LCI was seen as early as Day 15, i.e., -0.97 (P = 0.0002), and sustained through Week 
24, i.e., -0.88 (P = 0.0018), and after the 2-week Washout Period, i.e., -0.80. 
Rapporteur’s Comments 
Although the PD effects observed seem to be consistent with the observed PD effects of LUM/IVA in 
older populations for most parameters, given a single-arm study design, it is not possible to exclude 
effects from bias, i.e., Hawthorne effect during data collection from questionnaire, bias from other 
adjunctive therapies, or bias from natural growth. However, the complete reversal of sweat chloride 
following a two-week washout period is considered to be more robust evidence. Further, the clinical 
relevance of the observed change from baseline in secondary endpoints should be discussed in detail. 
The Applicant should also clarify the observed “deterioration” in ppFEV1 at Week 8. 
SAFETY EVALUATION 
Safety Results 
Part A 
No deaths, other serious AEs (SAEs), or AEs leading to premature treatment discontinuation occurred 
during Part A.  
Overall, the most common AEs were cough (4 [40.0%] subjects) and headache (3 [30.0%] subjects).  
There were no clinically meaningful results or clinically significant abnormalities in hematology and 
coagulation studies, urinalysis, vital signs, height, weight, BMI, or ECGs.

A few subjects had <3 × upper limit of normal (ULN) elevations in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) on 
Day 7 or Day 14. None of these elevations were associated with an increase in bilirubin. There was 1 
clinically significant hepatic enzyme increase but was considered not related to study drug.  
While declines in ppFEV1 were noted in 9 of 10 subjects 4 hours post-dose (mean [standard 
deviation]) absolute change in ppFEV1 of 10.07 [10.290] percentage points), the mean ppFEV1 
returned to near baseline by Day 7 and was approximately 3 percentage points above baseline at the 
Safety Follow-up Visit. A similar pattern was observed for percent predicted forced vital capacity 
(ppFVC) and percent predicted forced expiratory flow (ppFEF25%-75%). There was one AE of forced 
expiratory volume decreased was moderate in severity, it was considered not related to study. The 
etiology of the declines in ppFEV1 is unclear. The temporal nature (onset within 4 hours of dosing and 
resolution by Day 7) suggests airway narrowing (bronchoconstriction).  
Part B 
A total of 55 (94.8%) subjects had at least 1 AE. 
• The most common AEs (≥15%), mostly expected manifestations of CF disease: 
o  Cough (29 [50.0%] subjects),  
o  Nasal congestion (12 [20.7%] subjects),  
o 
Infective pulmonary exacerbation of CF (12 [20.7%] subjects),  
o  Headache (12 [20.7%] subjects). 
o  Six (10.3%) subjects had AEs leading to treatment interruption. 
• The majority of AEs were mild or moderate in severity (mild: 22 [37.9%] subjects and moderate: 29 
[50.0%] subjects). No life-threatening AEs occurred. 
• A total of 20 (34.5%) subjects had at least 1 AE considered related or possibly related to study drug. 
• Two (3.4%) subjects had AEs that led to treatment discontinuation  
o  ALT increased and AST increased in 1 [1.7%] subject 
o  Urticaria in 1 [1.7%] subject.  
• A total of 4 (6.9%) subjects had SAEs 
o  2 [3.4%] subjects had SAEs of infective pulmonary exacerbation of CF that were considered 
not related or unlikely related to study drug,  
o  1 [1.7%] subject had an SAE of ileus that was considered unlikely related to study drug,  
o  1 [1.7%] subject had SAEs of ALT increased and AST increased that were considered possibly 
related to study drug (see below).

There were no clinically meaningful trends identified from serum chemistry, hematology, coagulation 
studies, urinalysis, pulse oximetry, ECG, spirometry, or ophthalmological examination results. 
Rapporteur’s Comments 
The study report stating, in Part B, “The most common AEs (≥15%) by PT were cough (29 [50.0%] 
subjects), nasal congestion (12 [20.7%] subjects), infective pulmonary exacerbation of CF (12 
[20.7%] subjects), and headache (12 [20.7%] subjects). These AEs were mostly expected 
manifestations of CF disease.” should be clarified, i.e., whether they are related to the IMP or not. As 
according to guidance CT1 section 2.3. (32.), CT3 sections 7.2.3.1. and 7.2.3.2., AEs should be 
categorised as expected vs. unexpected to the IMP by the nature or severity of which not consistent 
with the applicable product information (e.g. investigator’s brochure for an unauthorised investigational 
product or summary of product characteristics for an authorised product)’ and an increase of 
occurrence, or severity of a known, already documented serious adverse reaction constitute 
unexpected events. 
Although LUM 100 mg/IVA 125-mg FDC tablet q12h seems to be well tolerated in subjects aged 6 
through 11 years with CF, there are serious safety concerns, especially on the hepatic events: 
- Given Part B designed to capture potential adverse reactions, i.e., a 92.3% chance of observing AEs 
in at least 1 subject if the true incidence rate is 5%, and a 99.5% chance of observing AEs in at least 1 
subject if the true incidence rate is 10%, the observed 7 (12.1%) subjects with elevated 
transaminases (AST or ALT >5x ULN) in the study suggest a significant incidence of hepatic injury.  
- The rates of observed AST or ALT >3x ULN or above are much higher than those described in the 
SPC, i.e., clinical studies with 24 weeks of treatment with lumacaftor/ivacaftor in patients aged 12 
years and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene. The study report also 
states “Although the incidences of transaminases elevations (ALT or AST) appeared to be higher than 
that observed in subjects aged 12 years and older (Studies VX12-809-103 and VX12-809-104), these 
are generally consistent with observations in subjects of the same age group from previously 
completed placebo-controlled IVA monotherapy studies and the information available in the published 
literature that indicates transaminase elevations are more common in younger patients with CF than in 
adults.” Given that ivacaftor (IVA) steady state levels appear to be higher in the Part B study 
compared to the pooled data from study 103 and 104, the observed higher incidence of transaminases 
elevations seems to be relevant. Further, according to Flass T, J Cyst Fibros 2013 Mar;12(2):116-24 
and Woodruff SA, J Cyst Fibros 2016 Aug 20. pii: S1569-1993(16)30571-9, among 298 children with 
CF born in Colorado from 1982 to 2005, of which 80.5% were identified by newborn screen, a small 
number of AST/ALT >3x ULN generally occurred during the first 2 years of life; none of which occurred 
at an annual visit beyond 2 years of age. Persistent elevations of AST, ALT or GGT more than 3 times 
the upper limit of normal were very rare. Therefore, the statement “transaminase elevations are more 
common in younger patients with CF than in adults” for rationalizing the observed elevated AST/ALT 
cannot be agreed.

- The reported Case had re-elevation of AST/ALT after resumption of LUM/IVA and hence the treatment 
was withdrawn. The causal relationship suggests a drug-induced liver injury. 
- Given the SAE of Case was considered to be possibly related to study drug, the Applicant should 
clarify whether the SAE was an expected adverse event as per Investigator’s brochures, or a 
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSAR) report had been submitted. 
The statement, “The overall data acquired to-date does not suggest an association between IVA 
treatment and cataract development” is contradictory to “a potential association has not been fully 
excluded” and should be deleted, given an adverse event of cataract considered by the investigator to 
be possibly related to study drug and the juvenile rat toxicity study demonstrating lens opacities in 
some animals. 
The Statistical Analysis Plan Part B states “One unplanned interim analysis (IA) was conducted after all 
subjects completed Week 4, with a data snapshot date of 19 June 2015.” and “The DMC conducted one 
review of the study safety data, with the same data snapshot date as the one used for the interim 
analysis.” The Applicant should provide the minutes from the IDMC. 
2.1.1.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Design 
The study design is not considered to be in line with the guidance for children with CF 
EMEA/CHMP/EWP/9147/2008-corr*. The study titled as “Phase 3” did not reflect correctly with the 
study objectives since none of the study objectives were subjected to confirmatory testing. 
Given that both Parts were single-arm, it is difficult to scrutinize the observed PD effects. The Applicant 
did not discuss the clinical relevance of the observed PD effects. It is not clear why the study allowed 
patients who have completed Part A to continue Part B and patients with transaminase levels as high 
as 5x ULN to be included in Part B without the safety profile in the target population being defined at 
that time. Further, it is not clear why Part B included in the PIP before initiation.  
Pharmacokinetics 
The concentrations of lumacaftor (LUM) following a LUM 100 mg/IVA 125-mg FDC tablet q12h in 
Subjects 6 through 11 Years of Age with Cystic Fibrosis (Part B) appear comparable to concentrations 
in observed in adolescents and adult subjects with cystic fibrosis administered LUM 400 mg q12h/IVA 
250 mg q12h. The ivacaftor (IVA) steady state levels appear to be higher in the Part B study compared 
to the pooled data from study 103 and 104.  
Similar to previous studies, decreases in the levels of IVA due to induction by LUM were observed. 
It is recommended to pool these data with the data from other studies into a population PK model in 
order to support a line extension.  
Pharmacodynamics 
Although the PD effects observed seem to be consistent with those from previous studies, the clinical 
relevance of the observed change from baseline have not been discussed in detail. Given a single-arm 
design, it is not possible to exclude effects from potential bias. However, the complete reversal of 
sweat chloride following a two-week washout period seems to be robust. There is a lack of full 
explanation on the deterioration in ppFEV1 at Week 8.

Safety 
Although LUM 100 mg/IVA 125-mg FDC tablet q12h seems to be well tolerated in subjects aged 6 
through 11 years with CF, there are serious safety concerns, especially on the hepatic events: 
- Given Part B designed to capture adverse reactions, i.e., a 92.3% chance of observing AEs in at least 
1 subject if the true incidence rate is 5%, and a 99.5% chance of observing AEs in at least 1 subject if 
the true incidence rate is 10%, the observed 7 (12.1%) subjects with elevated transaminases (AST or 
ALT >5x ULN) suggest a significant incidence of hepatic injury.  
- The rates of observed AST or ALT >3x ULN or above are much higher than those described in the 
SPC, i.e., clinical studies with 24 weeks of treatment with lumacaftor/ivacaftor in patients aged 12 
years and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene. The study report also 
states “Although the incidences of transaminases elevations (ALT or AST) appeared to be higher than 
that observed in subjects aged 12 years and older (Studies VX12-809-103 and VX12-809-104), these 
are generally consistent with observations in subjects of the same age group from previously 
completed placebo-controlled IVA monotherapy studies and the information available in the published 
literature that indicates transaminase elevations are more common in younger patients with CF than in 
adults.” Given that ivacaftor steady state levels appear to be higher in the Part B study compared to 
the pooled data from study 103 and 104, the observed higher incidence of transaminases elevations 
seems to be relevant to IVA. Further, according literature, persistent elevations of AST, ALT or GGT 
more than 3 times the upper limit of normal in children aged > 2 years with CF were very rare. 
Therefore, the statement “transaminase elevations are more common in younger patients with CF than 
in adults” for rationalizing the observed elevated AST/ALT cannot be agreed. 
- The reported Case had re-elevation of AST/ALT after resumption of LUM/IVA and hence the treatment 
was withdrawn. The causal relationship suggests a drug-induced liver injury. 
- Given the SAE of Case was considered to be possibly related to study drug, the Applicant should 
clarify whether the SAE was an expected adverse event as per Investigator’s brochures, otherwise a 
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSAR) report should have been submitted. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall conclusion 
Data from Study VX13-809-011 (Study 011) suggest potential drug-induced liver injury in subjects 
aged 6 through 11 years with CF and higher ivacaftor (IVA) steady state levels. These findings should 
be re-assessed along with results from Study VX14-809-109 (Study 109) and Study VX14-809-110 
(Study 110) when available. The risk-benefit assessment in subjects aged 6 through 11 years with CF 
is hence unable to be determined. 
Recommendation  
Depending on the Applicant’s response, further action may be required. 
Additional clarifications requested 
1. The clinical relevance of the observed change from baseline in secondary endpoints should be 
discussed in detail.

disease.” should be clarified, i.e., whether they are related to the IMP or not. As according to guidance 
CT1 section 2.3. (32.), CT3 sections 7.2.3.1. and 7.2.3.2., AEs should be categorised as expected vs. 
unexpected to the IMP by the nature or severity of which not consistent with the applicable product 
information (e.g. investigator’s brochure for an unauthorised investigational product or summary of 
product characteristics for an authorised product)’ and an increase of occurrence, or severity of a

Clinical aspects 
Question 1  
The clinical relevance of the observed change from baseline in secondary endpoints should be 
discussed in detail.  
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Sweat chloride 
Sweat chloride is an in vivo measure of CFTR function; therefore a reduction in sweat chloride indicates 
an improvement in CFTR function. Data from natural history indicate that improving CFTR function in 
patients homozygous for F508del by 10% to 20% would result in meaningful clinical benefit. 
In Study 011, treatment with LUM/IVA resulted in a reduction in sweat chloride at Day 15 and at Week 
4 that was sustained through Week 24. The within-group least squares (LS) mean absolute change 
from baseline was -19.7 mmol/L (P<0.0001) for the average at Day 15 and at Week 4 and -24.8 
mmol/L (P<0.0001) at Week 24, reflecting an improvement of approximately 20% in the dysfunctional 
F508del-CFTR protein. Assessment of sweat chloride at Week 26 Safety Follow-up Visit, following a 2-
week Washout, demonstrated nearly complete reversal of the changes in sweat chloride. 
After re-initiation of LUM/IVA by Study 011B subjects in Study 110, the mean (SD) absolute change 
from baseline in sweat chloride was -28.9 (12.3) mmol/L on Day 15, was generally stable during the 
Treatment Period, and was -29.0 (15.7) mmol/L at Week 24.  
Nutritional Status (Measured as Weight and BMI) 
CHMP assessment report for paediatric studies submitted in accordance with article 46 
of regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended  
Orkambi 
Page 32/50 
 
 
 
Malnutrition is common in patients with CF because of fat malabsorption and increased energy 
expenditures due to lung disease. Improved nutritional status, defined as an increase in body mass 
index (BMI) and/or weight, is considered an appropriate endpoint for therapies targeting pancreatic 
insufficiency and therapies targeting CF lung disease.  
In Study 011B, treatment with LUM/IVA resulted in improvements in measures of nutritional status 
(BMI and weight and associated z-scores) as early as Day 15 and continued to improve through all 
visits up to Week 24. The within-group LS mean absolute change from baseline at Week 24 was 0.64 
kg/m2 (P<0.0001) for BMI, 0.15 (P<0.0001) for BMI-for-age z-score, 2.6 kg (P<0.0001) for weight, 
and 0.13 (P<0.0001) for weight-for-age z-score. 
Mean BMI remained stable during the 2-week Washout Period between treatment in Study 011B and 
Study 110. After re-initiation of LUM/IVA administration in Study 110, the mean (SD) change from 
baseline in BMI was 0.63 (0.65) kg/m2 on Day 15, showed a general trend of increase, and was 1.17 
(1.13) kg/m2 at Week 36. Mean BMI-for-age z-score generally remained stable during the 2-week 
Washout Period and in Study 110. A similar pattern was observed for weight and weight-for-age z-
score. 
Patient-reported Outcomes 
The CFQ-R measures quality-of-life domains, including respiratory symptoms, digestive symptoms, 
emotion, and health perception. The TSQM encompasses measures of effectiveness, side effects, 
convenience, and global satisfaction, and is a widely used measure of satisfaction with medication. 
In Study 011B, treatment with LUM/IVA resulted in a favourable change in the CFQ-R respiratory 
domain score (Version: Children Ages 6 to 11) at Week 24. The within-group LS mean absolute change 
from baseline in the CFQ-R respiratory domain score at Week 24 was 5.4 points (P = 0.0085). 
Treatment with LUM/IVA also resulted in a favourable trend for changes in the TSQM domains at Week 
24. The within-group LS mean absolute change from baseline at Week 24 was 3.6 points (P = 0.2018) 
for the global satisfaction domain.  
Lung Function (Spirometry and LCI) 
Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) is linked to mortality, thus, any significant difference 
between placebo and active treatment is potentially clinically relevant. LCI is a measure of ventilation 
inhomogeneity that is based on tidal breathing techniques that has been evaluated in patients as 
young as infants. LCI correlates with FEV1 in its ability to measure airway disease and can detect lung 
disease at an earlier stage than spirometry. Effect sizes in studies have ranged from -1 to -2 
depending on the type of intervention and the duration of treatment. Overall, an improvement in LCI 
indicates an improvement in the ventilation inhomogeneity that is characteristic of CF lung disease and 
thus has the potential for long-term benefit, including impacting the progressive and irreversible loss of 
lung function that is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with CF. 
Given the potential advantages of a more sensitive measurement of early airway disease in younger 
children, LCI was assessed as an exploratory endpoint in Study 011B. LCI2.5 (the number of lung 
turnovers required to reduce the end tidal inert gas concentration to 1/40th of its starting value) is the 
most commonly used multiple-breath washout parameter. LCI5.0 (the number of lung turnovers 
required to reduce the end tidal inert gas concentration to 1/20th of its starting value) was also 
assessed as an exploratory endpoint.  
In Study 011B, subjects had a mean (SD) baseline ppFEV1 of 91.4 (13.7) and a mean (SD) baseline 
LCI2.5 of 9.99 (2.67), demonstrating that CF subjects with normal ppFEV1 values still have significant 
CF lung disease. Treatment with LUM/IVA demonstrated an improvement (reduction) in LCI2.5 as early 
as Day 15 that was sustained through Week 24. The within-group LS mean absolute change from 
CHMP assessment report for paediatric studies submitted in accordance with article 46 
of regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended  
Orkambi 
Page 33/50 
 
 
 
baseline in LCI2.5 was -0.86 (P = 0.0007) at Day 15, -0.88 (P = 0.0018) at Week 24, and -0.94 (P = 
0.0002) through Week 24. A similar trend was observed for LCI5.0. Consistent with the finding that 
improvements in LCI are correlated to changes in FEV1, treatment with LUM/IVA also resulted in an 
improvement in ppFEV1 at Week 24. The magnitude of the improvement in ppFEV1 in Study 011B was 
consistent with the statistically significant improvements in ppFEV1 that were rapid and sustained 
across all visits during the 24-week Treatment Period in studies in subjects 12 years of age and older. 
At the Week 26 Safety Follow-up Visit, following the 2-week Washout Period, ppFEV1 values returned 
to baseline, providing confidence that the improvement during the 24-week Treatment Period was 
treatment related. Mean LCI2.5 generally remained stable during the 2-week Washout Period between 
treatments in Study 011B. The LS mean treatment difference was -1.22 (P<0.0001) for the absolute 
change in LCI2.5 at Week 24 and 3.0 percentage points (P = 0.0195) for the absolute change in 
ppFEV1 at Week 24.  
In summary, results from Study 011B demonstrated that treatment with LUM/IVA resulted in rapid and 
sustained effects on multiple PD endpoints of CFTR modulation in multiple organ systems over 24 
weeks of treatment, supporting the clinical relevance of the changes. These changes include 
improvements in sweat chloride, nutritional status (BMI and weight and associated z-scores), and lung 
function (spirometry and LCI). There are no established minimum clinically important differences for 
these endpoints; however, the changes observed in Study 011B demonstrate a consistent, multi-
system impact of CFTR modulation in a population of subjects with severe disease.  
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
Although there are no established minimum clinically important differences for the secondary 
endpoints, it can be agreed that the observed effects are corroborative to the drug mechanism and 
pathophysiology of CF and therefore could be beneficial in the target population. The point is 
considered resolved. 
Question 2 
The Applicant should provide a full explanation on the deterioration in ppFEV1 at Week 8. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The decline in ppFEV1 noted at Week 8 of Study 011B likely represents the intrinsic variability of FEV1 
measurements, rather than a genuine clinically relevant event. This is particularly likely given that the 
mean ppFEV1 change from baseline was greater than zero at all other time points where it was 
assessed, including Weeks 16 and 24. The decline is not considered a significant safety concern 
because it resolved while administration of LUM/IVA continued and was generally not associated with 
clinical manifestations. There were no increases in pulmonary exacerbations (PExs), respiratory 
adverse events of special interest (AESIs), or other clinically meaningful findings at Week 8.  
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The explanation on the deterioration in ppFEV1 at Week 8 is not satisfactory. If the decline in ppFEV1 
measurement at Week 8 of Study 011B is considered to be attributed to an intrinsic variability in FEV1 
measurements, the MAH should investigate further by auditing. The point is not considered 
resolved.

Question 3 
The study report stating, in Part B, The most common AEs (≥15%) by PT were cough (29 [50.0%] 
subjects), nasal congestion (12 [20.7%] subjects), infective pulmonary exacerbation of CF (12 [20.7%] 
subjects), and headache (12 [20.7%] subjects). These AEs were mostly expected manifestations of CF 
disease.” should be clarified, i.e., whether they are related to the IMP or not. As according to guidance 
CT1 section 2.3. (32.), CT3 sections 7.2.3.1. and 7.2.3.2., AEs should be categorised as expected vs. 
unexpected to the IMP by the nature or severity of which not consistent with the applicable product 
information (e.g. investigator’s brochure for an unauthorised investigational product or summary of 
product characteristics for an authorised product)’ and an increase of occurrence, or severity of a 
known, already documented serious adverse reaction constitute unexpected events. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The MAH clarified that the above AEs are “typical” manifestations in patients with CF. The term 
“expected” does not refer to the expectedness assessment of AEs according to the reference safety 
information for expedited reporting purposes. Given these AEs are common manifestations in patients 
with CF and Study 011B was an open-label study enrolling a relatively small number of subjects, the 
ability to establish an association between these AEs and LUM/IVA treatment is limited. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The Applicant clarifies that the term “expected” does not refer to the expectedness assessment of AEs 
based on the Reference Safety Information (RSI); however, the above AEs are consistent with those 
described in the RSI of the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) which the MAH quoted in the response to 
Question No. 5: 
It is acknowledged that Study 011B was a study enrolling a relatively small number of subjects. Given 
an open-label nature without a control group of the study, adhering to the RSI for determining 
expectedness of AEs is crucial. The response above is therefore not considered satisfactory.  The point 
is not resolved.

The Applicant is required to address the following comments based on the data provided: Although 
LUM 100 mg/IVA 125-mg FDC tablet q12h seems to be well tolerated in subjects aged 6 through 11 
years with CF, there are serious safety concerns, especially on the hepatic events: 
- Given Part B designed to capture adverse reactions, i.e., a 92.3% chance of observing AEs in at least 
1 subject if the true incidence rate is 5%, and a 99.5% chance of observing AEs in at least 1 subject if 
the true incidence rate is 10%, the observed 7 (12.1%) subjects with elevated transaminases (AST or 
ALT >5x ULN) suggest a significant incidence of hepatic injury.  
- The rates of observed AST or ALT >3x ULN or above are much higher than those described in the 
SPC, i.e., clinical studies with 24 weeks of treatment with lumacaftor/ivacaftor in patients aged 12 
years and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene. The study report also 
states “Although the incidences of transaminases elevations (ALT or AST) appeared to be higher than 
that observed in subjects aged 12 years and older (Studies VX12-809-103 and VX12-809-104), these 
are generally consistent with observations in subjects of the same age group from previously 
completed placebo-controlled IVA monotherapy studies and the information available in the published 
literature that indicates transaminase elevations are more common in younger patients with CF than in 
adults.” Given that ivacaftor steady state levels appear to be higher in the Part B study compared to 
the pooled data from study 103 and 104, the observed higher incidence of transaminases elevations 
seems to be relevant to IVA. Further, according literature, persistent elevations of AST, ALT or GGT 
more than 3 times the upper limit of normal in children aged >2 years with CF were very rare. 
Therefore, the statement “transaminase elevations are more common in younger patients with CF than 
in adults” for rationalizing the observed elevated AST/ALT cannot be agreed. 
- The reported Case had re-elevation of AST/ALT after resumption of LUM/IVA and hence the treatment 
was withdrawn. The causal relationship suggests a drug-induced liver injury. 
And the Applicant is required to provide the following information: 
1)  Comparing above liver events with similar events in adults and adolescents [including any 
safety paediatric reports received by the company and any included in the Periodic Safety 
Update Reports (PSURs)]. 
2)  Comparing above liver events with those in pivotal studies, i.e., Study VX14-809-109 and 
Study VX15-809-110 from minutes of IDMC and Development Safety Update Reports (DSURs). 
3)  Implications for the SmPC, PIL, and future paediatric studies, and proposal for amendments 
with justification. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
To further evaluate the data related to liver function tests (LFTs) in subjects aged 6 through 11 years 
who were treated with LUM/IVA, analyses of clinical data across studies with varying age groups were 
conducted. Data of Study 109 and an interim report from Study 110 were used rather than data from a 
Data Monitoring Committee (DMC). Findings: 
1) The background incidence rate of transaminase elevations and similar AEs was more common in 
subjects with CF, aged 6 through 11 years, than in subjects with CF, aged 12 years or older. 
2) In subjects aged 6 through 11 years, the overall incidence rate of transaminase elevations and 
similar AEs that occurred during LUM/IVA treatment was similar to the background (placebo) incidence 
rate of this same population. 
3) In subjects aged 6 through 11 years, all LFT abnormalities had isolated transaminase elevations

of regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended

without concurrent elevations in total bilirubin. 
Background Incidence Rates by Age Group 
In the CF population aged 6 through 11 years, the background incidence rate of transaminase 
elevations was determined based on placebo data from 24-week Study 109 and the first 24 weeks of 
Study 770-103 (Phase 3 placebo-controlled IVA monotherapy study in subjects aged 6 through 11 
years with CF and the G551D mutation that is provided here for comparison of LFT data in the CF 
population). The placebo group in Study 109 had incidence rates of AST/ALT elevations above 
threshold (i.e., 3 ×, 5 ×, and 8 × ULN) that were 7.9%, 3.0%, and 2.0%, respectively (Table 2) 
whereas the placebo group in Study 770-103 had incidence rates of 15.4%, 3.8%, and 0%, 
respectively. Together, the data from these studies suggest elevated transaminases are common 
background events in the CF population aged 6 through 11 years. 
In the CF population aged 12 years and older, the background incidence rate of transaminase 
elevations was determined based on the pooled placebo data from two 24-week studies, Studies 
103/104. In the placebo group of Studies 103/104, the incidence rates of AST/ALT elevations above 
threshold (i.e., 3 ×, 5 ×, 8 × ULN) were 5.1%, 1.9%, and 0.5%, respectively (Table 2). 
Overall, when comparing the background incidence rates of transaminase elevations above these 
thresholds among the different age groups, the data showed the incidence was higher in the CF 
population aged 6 through 11 years. 
LUM/IVA versus Placebo Incidence Rates in Subjects Aged 6 Through 11 Years  
In subjects aged 6 through 11 years, the incidence rate of elevated transaminases was compared 
between the LUM/IVA groups of Studies 109 and 011B and the placebo groups of Studies 109 and 770-
103 (Table 2). 
Overall, the results showed the incidence rate of AST/ALT elevations above threshold that occurred 
during LUM/IVA treatment was generally similar to the background (placebo) incidence rate in this 
age group. 
LFTs are also being assessed in ongoing Study 110. Based on the first 36 weeks of data from Study 
011B subjects in Study 110 IA1, the incidence of LFT results that met threshold criteria was lower in 
Study 110 than during the initial 24 weeks of treatment in Study 011B; the incidence rates of AST/ALT 
elevations above threshold (i.e., 3 ×, 5 ×, 8 × ULN) were 12.2%, 6.1%, and 4.1%, respectively

Elevated Transaminases Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Background Incidence Rates by Age Group 
In the placebo group of Study 109, the overall background incidence rate of elevated transaminase 
AESIs was 9.9%, while the incidence rate for these same AESIs that led to treatment discontinuation 
or that were considered serious was 2.0% each (Table 3). Overall, the data suggest the background 
prevalence of elevated transaminase AESIs, including those leading to treatment discontinuation or 
considered serious, is relatively common in this younger CF population. In the CF population aged 12 
years and older, the background incidence rate of transaminase elevation AESIs was determined based 
on the placebo data from Studies 103/104. In the placebo group of Studies 103/104, the overall 
background incidence rate of elevated transaminase AESIs was 4.6% (Table 3). There were no AESIs 
that led to treatment discontinuation or that were considered serious in this age group. 
Overall, when comparing the background incidence rate of elevated transaminase AESIs, including 
those leading to treatment discontinuation or considered serious, among the different age groups, the 
results showed the incidence was higher in the younger CF population. 
LUM/IVA versus Placebo Incidence Rates in Subjects Aged 6 through 11 Years 
In subjects aged 6 through 11 years, the incidence rate of elevated transaminase AESIs between the 
LUM/IVA groups of Studies 011B and 109 and the placebo group of Study 109 was compared. Overall, 
the results showed the incidence rates of elevated transaminase AESIs, including those leading to 
treatment discontinuation or considered serious, were generally similar between both the LUM/IVA and 
placebo treatment groups in this age group.

Other Hepatobiliary Events 
In Studies 103/104, conducted in subjects aged 12 years and older, there were 3 subjects with serious 
AEs involving concurrent elevations in transaminases (ALT or AST) and total bilirubin, which were 
reported as cholestasis, hepatitis, or hepatitis cholestatic. In Studies 011B and 109, conducted in 
subjects aged 6 through 11 years, all LFT abnormalities had isolated transaminase elevations without 
concurrent elevations in total bilirubin. 
Ivacaftor Exposure in the LUM/IVA Combination Regimen 
The association between IVA and LFT abnormal is yet to be confirmed. 
Although the IVA exposure in the LUM/IVA combination dosing regimen for subjects aged 6 through 11 
years is higher than that in subjects aged 12 years and older, it is still substantially lower than that of 
IVA monotherapy. As such, the IVA exposure is not considered as a potential contributing factor for 
these LFT elevations.  
Conclusion 
The background incidence rate of transaminase elevations and similar AEs was more common in 
subjects with CF aged 6 through 11 years than in subjects aged 12 years and older. The higher 
incidence rate of elevated transaminases observed in Studies 011B and 109 compared to Studies 
103/104 is likely attributable to the higher background incidence rate seen in the younger CF 
population. However, the potential for drug-induced liver injury cannot be excluded. Therefore, the 
Orkambi SmPC contains warnings for elevated transaminases, including those with concurrent bilirubin 
elevations, while on LUM/IVA treatment and recommends routine LFT monitoring. Based on review of 
available clinical data in subjects aged 6 through 11 years, the warnings and recommendations with 
regard to hepatobiliary events in the current product labelling are considered sufficient. 
A submission for a proposed indication extension of Orkambi for the treatment of CF in patients 6 
through 11 years of age who are homozygous for F508del included further details summarizing the 
hepatobiliary data in subjects aged 6 through 11 years from Studies 011B and 109, and a proposed 
revision to the SmPC (Section 4.8) that includes descriptions of hepatobiliary data for subjects aged 6 
through 11 years. In ongoing and future studies involving pediatric subjects, LFTs will be closely 
monitored. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
Despite the data provided suggest higher background incidence rates of transaminase elevations in the 
CF population aged 6 through 11 years vs. patients aged 12 years or above, the Applicant still has not

of regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended

Page 39/50 
 
 
 
 
explained why the observed incidence rates of transaminase elevations in Study 011B are higher than 
those of the active group in Study 109. Further, data shown in Table 2 above does not support the 
claim on “the incidence rate of AST/ALT elevations above threshold that occurred during LUM/IVA 
treatment was generally similar to the background (placebo) incidence rate in this age group”. 
Although the potential for drug-induced liver injury in patients 6 through 11 years of age will be 
acknowledged in the proposed revised SPC of the extension for indication, no specific risk mitigation 
strategies will be adopted as per request. Therefore, the response above is not considered satisfactory. 
The point is not resolved. 
Question 5 
Given the SAE of Case was considered to be possibly related to study drug, the Applicant should clarify 
whether the SAE was an expected adverse event as per Investigator’s brochures, or a Suspected 
Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSAR) report had been submitted. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The LUM/IVA Investigator’s Brochure (IB) is the reference safety information for clinical studies using 
LUM/IVA (LUM/IVA IB, version 1.0, dated 16 June 2015). Elevations in transaminases, including AST 
and ALT, are described as ADRs in the IB. Therefore, the event for one Subject was assessed as 
expected and was not reported as a SUSAR. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
Given Study 011B was initiated on 15 January 2015, it would not be possible to apply LUM/IVA IB, 
version 1.0, dated 16 June 2015, as the Reference Safety Information (RSI). Further, the RSI in IB, 
i.e., Table 8-1 Incidence of Adverse Drug Reactions, and Section 8.6.1.1 Description of Selected 
Adverse Drug Reactions of IB does not include such SAE occurred in one Subject. Therefore, as per 
guidance CT1 section 2.3. (32.), CT3 sections 7.2.3.1. and 7.2.3.2., a SUSAR report should have been 
submitted. Hence the response is not satisfactory. The point is not resolved. 
Question 6 
The statement, “The overall data acquired to-date does not suggest an association between IVA 
treatment and cataract development” is contradictory to “a potential association has not been fully 
excluded” and should be deleted, given an adverse event of cataract considered by the investigator to 
be possibly related to study drug and the juvenile rat toxicity study demonstrating lens opacities in 
some animals. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Although cases of cataracts have been reported in both programs, the overall findings have not yet 
indicated a likely causal association with IVA or LUM/IVA treatment. Nearly all cataracts reported in 
humans have been associated with confounding risk factors, such as steroid use, exposure to radiation, 
or diabetes. When coupled with the high background prevalence of lens opacities in patients with CF, 
the overall clinical evidence accumulated to date does not support a direct association between IVA or 
LUM/IVA and cataracts. Nevertheless, the nonclinical findings of cataracts in newborn rats present a 
potential association with IVA treatment that cannot be completely excluded in humans at this time. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response

of regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended

The response above is contradictory to itself, as “a potential association between cataracts and IVA 
treatment still cannot be completely excluded in humans”. The point is not resolved. 
Question 7 
The Statistical Analysis Plan Part B states “One unplanned interim analysis (IA) was conducted after all 
subjects completed Week 4, with a data snapshot date of 19 June 2015.” and “The DMC conducted one 
review of the study safety data, with the same data snapshot date as the one used for the interim 
analysis.” The Applicant should provide the minutes from the IDMC. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The unplanned interim analysis was conducted to address a DMC review of Study 011 data and to 
provide sample size information potentially relevant to Study 109. The DMC recommendation was to 
allow the study to go forward per protocol without changes. Minutes (dated 14 September 2015) from 
the DMC review of the interim analysis data and the v1.0 and v2.0 SAPs for IA1, dated 18 June 2015 
and 26 August 2015are included with this response.  
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The Applicant provided the DMC meeting minutes that took place on 14 September 2015, which 
confirm the DMC recommendations as stated by the Applicant. The point is resolved. 
Question 8 
The Applicant is requested to present the results for the secondary endpoints as well as the 
characteristics of the patients before and after the unplanned interim analysis to provide reassurance 
that the integrity of the trial has not been compromised.  
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Study 011B was an open-label study, thus, the integrity of the trial, including the secondary endpoints, 
was not compromised by the interim analysis, which was conducted to address a DMC review of Study 
011 data. In addition, the data were reviewed internally to provide sample size information potentially 
relevant to Study 109 (no changes were made to the Study 109 protocol as a result of the review). 
The interim analysis was conducted after all subjects completed at least the Week 4 Visit of Study 
011B. As the interim analysis was conducted after all subjects were enrolled and had completed at 
least the Week 4 Visit, the characteristics, including demographic and baseline characteristics and PD 
outcomes, were not meaningfully different from those reported at the corresponding time point in the 
final clinical study report. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The Applicant states that the interim analysis took place after all subjects had completed at least the 
Week 4 Visit of Study 011B. Therefore it is agreed that the characteristics of subjects before and after 
the interim analysis will remain the same. The point is resolved. 
Question 9 
The Applicant is requested to present analysis for sweat chloride where the worst value is used instead 
of the median values, when replicate values are available.

of regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended

Summary of the MAH’s response 
There were no subjects with multiple measurements at any time point. Therefore only 1 sweat chloride 
measurement per subject was used for all analyses. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The Applicant confirms that all subjects had only one sweat chloride measurement. The point is 
resolved. 
Question 10 
The Applicant is requested to justify why change from baseline to Day 15 and Week 4 was calculated 
using the average of Day 15 and Week 4 for sweat chloride. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The main statistical analysis for this endpoint was performed on the basis that a similar effect was 
anticipated for the sweat chloride response at Day 15 and Week 4; the estimated treatment effects 
were averaged to reduce variability and increase the confidence in the point estimate. Supportive 
analyses were also conducted to summarize the absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride at 
each visit, which confirmed the anticipated similar effect at each time point. The within-group LS mean 
absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride was -20.4 mmol/L (95% CI: -23.9, -16.9; P<0.0001) 
at Day 15 and -19.0 mmol/L (95% CI: -22.9, -15.2; P<0.0001) at Week 4. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The Applicant explains that similar effect was anticipated for sweat chloride response at Day 15 and 
Week 4. It is agreed that taking the average value decreases the uncertainty in the estimate. The point 
is resolved. 
Question 11 
There were seven subjects with important protocol violations. The Applicant is requested to assess the 
impact of these violations on the assessment of secondary endpoints. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Based on the intention-to-treat principle, all available data were included in the analyses to provide a 
conservative approach for data interpretation. The impact of the important protocol deviations (IPDs) 
on the secondary endpoints is considered minimal to negative. 
The following 7 subjects had IPDs during Study 011B (VX13-809-011/Section 10.5.2): 
Two subjects had treatment compliance <80%: 1 subject (treatment compliance of 75%) had 
treatment interrupted for a total of 42 days due to AEs of increased ALT and AST values; 1 subject 
(treatment compliance of 38.1%) had treatment interrupted for a total of 13 days and was 
discontinued from treatment due to an AE of urticaria. Given that these subjects had lower exposure to 
LUM/IVA, including these subjects in the analyses could have reduced the apparent treatment effect 
observed. 
Four subjects did not have an ophthalmologic examination at the Week 24 Visit or the Week 26 Safety 
Follow-up Visit. These IPDs would not have impacted the assessment of the secondary endpoints, 
CHMP assessment report for paediatric studies submitted in accordance with article 46 
of regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended  
Orkambi 
Page 42/50 
 
 
 
 
 
which evaluated the PD and PK of LUM/IVA treatment. Two of the 4 subjects rolled over to ongoing 
Study 110 and had a follow-up ophthalmologic examination in the study. 
One subject did not meet an inclusion criterion (inclusion criterion 5: subjects who are homozygous for 
the F508del-CFTR mutation) and was enrolled. This subject was discontinued from treatment and the 
study (the last dose was Day 18). The limited data included for this subject are unlikely to have 
impacted the results in a meaningful way. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The exclusion of two subjects for compliance <80% and one subject who did not meet the inclusion 
criterion 5 from analysis of secondary endpoints is contradictory to the stated intention-to-treat 
principle, and therefore is not considered as a conservative approach for data interpretation. Further, 
the study protocol does not explicitly allow such exclusion from analysis. The claim on “the impact of 
the important protocol deviations (IPDs) on the secondary endpoints is considered minimal to 
negative” is lacking supportive evidence. The point is not resolved. 
Conclusion 
The response to the request for supplementary information from the MAH is not considered 
satisfactory, as the safety concerns have not been fully addressed and there seems to be issues of trial 
conduct. 
Safety: 
Despite the data provided suggest higher background incidence rates of transaminase elevations in the 
CF population aged 6 through 11 years vs. patients aged 12 years or above, the Applicant has not 
explained why the observed incidence rates of transaminase elevations in Study 011B are higher than 
those of the active group in Study 109. Further, data shown in Table 2 above does not support the 
claim on “the incidence rate of AST/ALT elevations above threshold that occurred during LUM/IVA 
treatment was generally similar to the background (placebo) incidence rate in this age group”. 
Although the potential for drug-induced liver injury in patients 6 through 11 years of age will be stated 
in the proposed revised SPC of the extension for indication, no specific risk mitigation strategies will be 
adopted. The response regarding a potential association between cataracts and IVA treatment in 
humans is contradictory to itself. 
Trial Conduct: 
The MAH claims that the decline in ppFEV1 measurement at Week 8 only could be attributable to an 
intrinsic variability in FEV1 measurements, rather than a genuine clinically relevant event. However, 
the MAH has not yet  fully investigated this.  
Given Study 011B was initiated on 15 January 2015, it would not be possible to apply LUM/IVA IB, 
version 1.0, dated 16 June 2015, as the Reference Safety Information (RSI). Given an open-label 
nature without a control group of the study, adhering to the RSI for determining expectedness of AEs 
is crucial. On the basis of information provided, the SAE of one Case should have been reported as a 
SUSAR. 
The exclusion of two subjects for compliance <80% and one subject who did not meet the inclusion 
criterion 5 from analysis of secondary endpoints is not in line with the study protocol which does not

of regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended

explicitly allow such exclusion. The claim on “the impact of the important protocol deviations (IPDs) on 
the secondary endpoints is considered minimal to negative” is lacking supportive evidence. 
The risk-benefit assessment in subjects aged 6 through 11 years with CF is hence still not 
determinable. The data of Study 011B should be scrutinised along with results from Study VX14-809-
109 (Study 109) and Study VX14-809-110 (Study 110).

4.  Assessment of the second responses to the request for 
supplementary information  
BACKGROUND 
Study 011 was submitted to the EMA under Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 on 15 
November 2016. Following Day 60 of the procedure the CHMP assessment report (dated 26 January 
2017) included a Request for Supplementary Information. The MAH provided responses to the 
requested clarifications (dated 17 March 2017). 
The Rapporteur’s second assessment report (dated 21 April 2017) considered Questions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 
and 11 to remain unresolved, and requested further responses. In a teleconference on 26 May 2017 
with the Rapporteur’s assessment team, the MAH sought clarification on 3 of the outstanding questions 
(Questions 3, 5, and 6 [Module 1.2/Annex 5.14 - MHRA Rapporteur Clarification Meeting Minutes]). 
The MAH acknowledged that some of the previous responses could have been clearer and were not 
considered to fully address the questions. This document provides further responses to the 6 questions 
considered unresolved in the Rapporteur’s assessment report dated 21 April 2017 (Questions 2, 3, 4, 
5, 6, and 11). 
Question 2 
The Applicant should provide a full explanation on the deterioration in ppFEV1 at Week 8. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The MAH acknowledged that the value for ppFEV1 at Week 8 of Study 011B was lower than those at 
other time points during the Treatment Period. However, it represented -1.2 percentage points below 
the baseline and was not statistically significant. The variability in FEV1 is a known characteristic in 
patients with CF, which can lead to inter- and/or intra-individual fluctuations in measurements over 
time as presented in Figure 1, rather than to variability in the spirometry measurements in the study. 
CHMP assessment report for paediatric studies submitted in accordance with article 46 
of regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended  
Orkambi 
Page 45/50 
 
 
 
 
 
Further, among the 31 subjects who had an absolute change in ppFEV1 ≤0 at Week 8, the ppFEV1 
values for 15 subjects returned near to or above baseline at the next visit and the ppFEV1 values for 
the other 16 subjects remained below baseline at the next visit. Only 1 (1.7%) of the 31 subjects 
discontinued treatment due to adverse events (AEs) (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and aspartate 
aminotransferase [AST] increased). The ad-hoc analysis revealed neither any consistent trend across 
subjects or time points, or any evidence suggesting that AEs of respiratory events, PExs of CF, or 
upper respiratory infection led to a symptomatic ppFEV1 decline at Week 8.  
Given the spirometry methods used in the study were standardized and validated, the lack of evidence 
for clinically meaningful findings associated with the mean ppFEV1 value at Week 8, and considering 
that the mean data points for ppFEV1 at all other time points were positive, the MAH did not believe 
that the mean ppFEV1 measurement at Week 8 would be clinically meaningful. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
Given above explanation, it can be agreed that the observed lower values of ppFEV1 at Week 8 could 
be inter- and intra-individual fluctuations in measurements over time, rather than having any 
statistical or clinical significance. The MAH also clarified that the spirometry methods used in the study 
were standardized and validated. The point is considered resolved. 
Question 3 
The study report stating, in Part B, the most common AEs (≥15%) by PT were cough (29 [50.0%] 
subjects), nasal congestion (12 [20.7%] subjects), infective pulmonary exacerbation of CF (12 
[20.7%] subjects), and headache (12 [20.7%] subjects). These AEs were mostly expected 
manifestations of CF disease.” should be clarified, i.e., whether they are related to the IMP or not. As 
per guidance CT1 section 2.3. (32.), CT3 sections 7.2.3.1. and 7.2.3.2., AEs should be categorised as 
expected vs. unexpected to the IMP by the nature or severity of which not consistent with the 
applicable product information (e.g. investigator’s brochure for an unauthorised investigational product 
or summary of product characteristics for an authorised product)’ and an increase of occurrence, or 
severity of a known, already documented serious adverse reaction constitute unexpected events. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The MAH acknowledged that use of the word “expected” in this response was unclear in the context of 
the requirements of CT-3 and confirmed that the expectedness was assessed according to the RSI in 
the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) during Study 011B as per EU Clinical Trial Guidance. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH has clarified that the trial safety assessment for Study 011B was in line with the EU CT 
guidance. The point is resolved. 
Question 4 
The Applicant is required to address the following comments based on the data provided: 
Although LUM 100 mg/IVA 125-mg FDC tablet q12h seems to be well tolerated in subjects aged 6 
through 11 years with CF, there are serious safety concerns, especially on the hepatic events: 
CHMP assessment report for paediatric studies submitted in accordance with article 46 
of regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended  
Orkambi 
Page 46/50 
 
 
 
 
 
- Given Part B designed to capture adverse reactions, i.e., a 92.3% chance of observing AEs in at least 
1 subject if the true incidence rate is 5%, and a 99.5% chance of observing AEs in at least 1 subject if 
the true incidence rate is 10%, the observed 7 (12.1%) subjects with elevated transaminases (AST or 
ALT >5x ULN) suggest a significant incidence of hepatic injury. 
- The rates of observed AST or ALT >3x ULN or above are much higher than those described in the 
SPC, i.e., clinical studies with 24 weeks of treatment with lumacaftor/ivacaftor in patients aged 12 
years and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene. The study report also 
states “Although the incidences of transaminases elevations (ALT or AST) appeared to be higher than 
that observed in subjects aged 12 years and older (Studies VX12-809-103 and VX12-809-104), these 
are generally consistent with observations in subjects of the same age group from previously 
completed placebo-controlled IVA monotherapy studies and the information available in the published 
literature that indicates transaminase elevations are more common in younger patients with CF than in 
adults.” 
Given that ivacaftor steady state levels appear to be higher in the Part B study compared to the pooled 
data from study 103 and 104, the observed higher incidence of transaminases elevations seems to be 
relevant to IVA. Further, according literature, persistent elevations of AST, ALT or GGT more than 3 
times the upper limit of normal in children aged >2 years with CF were very rare. Therefore, the 
statement “transaminase elevations are more common in younger patients with CF than in adults” for 
rationalizing the observed elevated AST/ALT cannot be agreed. 
- One Case had re-elevation of AST/ALT after resumption of LUM/IVA and hence the treatment was 
withdrawn. The causal relationship suggests a drug-induced liver injury. 
And the Applicant is required to provide the following information: 
1) Comparing above liver events with similar events in adults and adolescents [including any safety 
paediatric reports received by the company and any included in the Periodic Safety Update Reports 
(PSURs)]. 
2) Comparing above liver events with those in pivotal studies, i.e., Study VX14-809-109 and Study 
VX15-809-110 from minutes of IDMC and Development Safety Update Reports (DSURs). 
3) Implications for the SmPC, PIL, and future paediatric studies, and proposal for amendments with 
justification. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The MAH discussed the differences in transaminase elevations between Study 011B and Study 109 and 
between lumacaftor/ivacaftor (LUM/IVA) and placebo treatments. 
LUM/IVA Treatment: Study 011B Versus Study 109 LUM/IVA Group 
Overall, there were no meaningful differences in the subject profiles between studies that would 
explain the difference in incidence of treatment-emergent transaminase elevations in LUM/IVA-treated 
subjects. Following a LUM 200 mg/IVA 250 mg every 12 hours (q12h) regimen for 24 weeks, the 
concentrations of LUM and IVA were similar in Study 011B and Study 109. Given the relatively small 
numbers of subjects with transaminase elevations in both studies, the difference in transaminase 
elevations was considered likely to be due to inter-study variability in this population who had high 
background liver function abnormalities associated with CF liver disease.

of regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended

The MAH acknowledged that the percentage of subjects with transaminase elevations was numerically 
higher in LUM/IVA-treated subjects in Study 011B and Study 109 relative to the placebo group in 
Study 109. Transaminase elevations across both Study 011B and Study 109 were isolated lab 
abnormalities (i.e., without concurrent bilirubin elevation) and most subjects remained on treatment or 
resumed treatment after interruption without further elevations. As summarized in Table 3, the 
percentage of subjects who had discontinuations due to AEs of special interest (AESIs) of elevated 
transaminases was low and comparable between the LUM/IVA-treated subjects and the placebo group 
Study 109 (3 of 161 LUM/IVA-treated subjects in Study 011B and Study 109, and 2 of 101 placebo 
subjects in Study 109). In addition, the percentage of subjects with AESIs of elevated transaminases 
was comparable between the LUM/IVA-treated subjects and the placebo group Study 109 (17 of 161 
LUM/IVA-treated subjects in Study 011B and Study 109, and 10 of 101 placebo subjects in Study 109). 
In the proposed SmPC submitted in the Line Extension on March 03 2017 and currently under review 
(EMEA/H/C/003954/X/0020), the monitoring recommendations were proposed to be unchanged but a 
description of the transaminase elevations in Study 011B and Study 109 was added, to ensure that 
appropriate information will be available for prescribers, caregivers, and patients.  
In conclusion, the MAH considers that the current warnings and precautions, including monitoring 
recommendations, are appropriate and sufficient to monitor and manage transaminase elevations in 
patients of this age group. The MAH will continue to monitor transaminase elevations as part of post-
marketing pharmacovigilance surveillance, and evaluate the need for additional risk management or 
other actions, as appropriate. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH explained that the small number of subjects with transaminase elevations in both studies was 
likely to be due to inter-study variability in this population who had high background liver function 
abnormalities associated with CF liver disease and would like to continue monitoring transaminase 
elevations as part of post-marketing pharmacovigilance surveillance and evaluating the need for 
additional risk management or other actions, as appropriate. The relevant sections in the SmPC are 
under review (EMEA/H/C/003954/X/0020). This can be accepted. The point is resolved.

Question 5 
Given the SAE of one Case was considered to be possibly related to study drug, the Applicant should 
clarify whether the SAE was an expected adverse event as per Investigator’s brochures, or a 
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSAR) report had been submitted. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The MAH clarified that the case was in fact assessed against the RSI in place at the time (LUM IB, 
version 7.0 [dated 27 March 2014]) as unexpected and expedited as a SUSAR (case number: XXXX) 
on 06 May 2015 with follow-up reports on 14 May 2015, 28 May 2015, and 22 June 2015. In the 
response dated 17 March 2017, the MAH stated “the event for one Subject was assessed as expected” 
in error. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH has confirmed that the queried case had been submitted as a SUSAR. This is acceptable. The 
point is resolved. 
Question 6 
The statement, “The overall data acquired to-date does not suggest an association between IVA 
treatment and cataract development” is contradictory to “a potential association has not been fully 
excluded” and should be deleted, given an adverse event of cataract considered by the investigator to 
be possibly related to study drug and the juvenile rat toxicity study demonstrating lens opacities in 
some animals. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The MAH clarified that the statement “The overall data acquired to-date does not suggest an 
association between IVA treatment and cataract development" was not intended as to refute the 
potential association between cataracts and IVA treatment. Although risk factors were present in some 
cases, a possible risk attributable to IVA cannot be excluded. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
Given above clarification, the MAH did not intend to refute the potential association between cataracts 
and IVA treatment, the point is considered resolved. 
Question 11 
There were seven subjects with important protocol violations. The Applicant is requested to assess the 
impact of these violations on the assessment of secondary endpoints. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Consistent with the intention-to-treat principle, all subjects (including the 7 with important protocol 
deviations (IPDs)) were included in the analyses as defined by the Study 011 protocol and statistical 
analysis plan. Therefore, all available data for the 2 subjects with compliance <80% and the subject 
who did not meet inclusion criterion 5 were included in the analysis. None of the subjects with IPDs 
were excluded from the analysis.

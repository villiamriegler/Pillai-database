Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) 
That with other epoetin products, the risk of immunogenicity in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) 
is increased with the subcutaneous (sc) route. 
There is insufficient data on Abseamed to know the size of any increased immunogenicity risk 
with sc use 
Therefore, the sc route is not recommended for patients with CKD 
The loss of efficacy or other symptoms of the development of immunogenicity should be 
investigated 
Any suspected case of  Pure Red Cell Aplasia or development of immunogenicity should be 
reported to the MAH

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Narcolepsy is a rare, chronic neurological disorder, known as an “orphan disease”, frequently occurring 
from childhood and persisting through adolescence and adulthood. Individuals suffering from narcolepsy 
exhibit excessive daytime somnolence, sleep attacks, cataplexy and dyssomnia where nocturnal sleep is 
usually fragmented and may be associated with sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucinations.  
Claimed therapeutic indication 
Wakix is indicated in adults, adolescents and children from the age of 6 years for the treatment of 
narcolepsy with or without cataplexy (see also section 5.1).   
Epidemiology  
The prevalence of narcolepsy in childhood is not known but can be estimated from adult studies to be 
greater than 20-60 per 100,000 (0.02% to 0.06%) in Western countries. [Longstreth, 2007; Lecendreux 
et al. 2013; Partinen, 2014]. 
Initial symptoms of narcolepsy occur before the age of 18 in over 50% of patients and may start at a 
very young age also before puberty onset, often with stronger symptoms than in adults [Bassetti et al. 
2021]. On average, the prevalence is reported to be approximately 0.025-0.05%, and in at least half 
the cases the disease starts in childhood and adolescence [Plazzi et al. 2018]. 
Most  studies  assessing  the  prevalence  of  narcolepsy  are  questionnaire-based  or  interview-  based, 
without a formal diagnosis being known, therefore the prevalence estimates could reflect a mixture of 
subtypes 1 and 2. In addition, the long diagnostic delay (8–12 years from disease onset) could cause an 
underestimation  of  the  prevalence.  However,  in  recent  years,  probably  owing  to  increasing  disease 
awareness, more cases have been diagnosed sooner after onset, especially in children. 
Although the onset of narcolepsy can occur at any age (ranging from 3 to 80 years), in most patients, 
disease onset is in adolescence or early adulthood [Ohayon et al. 2005]. The onset of symptoms tends 
to be bimodal: the highest peak is around 15 years of age, and a smaller peak around 36 years of age 
[Dauvilliers et al. 2001, Thorpy et al. 2014]. In fact, it was shown in one study that more than one third 
of  narcoleptic  patients  experienced  the  first  symptoms  of  their  disease  before  the  age  of  15  years 
[Challamel et al. 1994], which is particularly invalidating at the age of learning. 
Paediatric  narcolepsy  is  also  associated  with  comorbidities  including  rapid  weight  gain,  precocious 
puberty, and ADHD, and increased risk for deficits in social functioning, depression, and anxiety. School 
performance is also typically impaired, requiring special education services [Plazzi et al. 2018]. A recently 
published systematic review of the literature showed that more than 30% of children with narcolepsy 
presented symptoms of ADHD [Kim et al. 2020].

Biologic features 
Narcolepsy with or without cataplexy can be secondary to brain tumors or several rare diseases, but in 
most cases it is a primary condition, better explained by the selective loss of hypocretin neurons in the 
posterolateral hypothalamus. [Lecendreux et al. 2014] 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
The presentation of narcolepsy can be very variable, making the diagnosis difficult. Narcolepsy is a long-
term sleep disorder which affects the brain’s ability to regulate the normal sleep-wake cycle. This leads 
to symptoms such as an irresistible urge to sleep, even at inappropriate times and places, and disturbed 
night-time  sleep.  Some  patients  also  have  episodes  of  severe  muscle  weakness  (cataplexy)  that  can 
cause  collapse.  Narcolepsy  occurs  during  childhood  in  combination  with  cataplexy  in  two-thirds  of 
patients. Symptoms may develop rapidly over a few weeks or months, with excessive daytime sleepiness 
(EDS) and cataplexy being the most dramatic and observable symptoms.  
The  diagnosis  criteria  have  been  defined  in  the  revised  International  Classification  of  Sleep  Disorders 
(ICSD- 3, AASM 2014) and separate the narcolepsy with cataplexy (Type 1) and the narcolepsy without 
cataplexy (Type 2) as presented in Table 1. 
Table 1: Narcolepsy according to the International Clasification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD—3) 
The onset of type 1 narcolepsy (NT1) usually begins when the patient is from 10 to 20 years old, while 
narcolepsy type 2 (NT2) seems to be less frequent compared with NT1 [Franceschini et al. 2020]. 
Management 
According to guidelines published by the European task force [Billiard et al. 2006, Bassetti et al. 2021], 
management  of  narcolepsy  with  or  without  cataplexy  relies  on  several  classes  of  drugs,  namely 
stimulants  for  EDS,  antidepressants  for  cataplexy,  and  hypno-sedative  drugs  for  disturbed  nocturnal 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/180217/2023  
Page 8/70 
 
 
 
 
sleep  [Dauvilliers  et  al.  2003].  However,  the  use  of  these  treatments  may  be  limited  by  associated 
adverse effects and because the dosing regimen may require a nocturnal intake. 
Treatment  options  for  children  with  narcolepsy  are  largely  managed  by  sleep  specialists  and  involve 
management  of  alertness  and  sleep.  Off-label  medications  for  alertness  include  stimulants 
(amphetamine  and  non-amphetamine),  and  wake-promoting  agents  such  as  modafinil,  and  the 
histamine receptor antagonists – pitolisant [Inocente et al. 2012, Lecendreux et al. 2020].  
Cataplexy  may  be  managed  with  serotonin  reuptake  inhibitors  (fluoxetine),  tricyclic  antidepressants 
(clomipramine), or selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (venlafaxine) [Franceschini et al. 2020]. 
Cataplexy,  daytime  sleepiness,  and  night-time  sleep  quality  can  be  managed  with  sodium  oxybate  in 
paediatrics > 7 years of age. Some drugs, like sodium oxybate, have high potential for abuse and require 
careful oversight [Thorpy et al. 2020]. Pitolisant showed absence or low abuse potential  according to 
clinical data (Setnik, 2020). 
According to the current European guidelines for treatment for EDS in narcolepsy in paediatrics [Bassetti 
et al. 2021], sodium oxybate (authorised in the EU and US), or methylphenidate, modafinil, pitolisant 
and  amphetamine  derivates  are  recommended  as  first  line  monotherapy  treatment.  Combination 
therapies including pitolisant are recommended for EDS with cataplexy, associated or not with disturbed 
nocturnal sleep. 
In addition to symptoms, narcolepsy has often a negative impact on the child’s psychological well-being, 
and non-pharmacological treatment, such as cognitive behavioural therapy, or counselling, may also be 
necessary. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
WAKIX was authorised by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2016 and is indicated in adults for 
the treatment of narcolepsy with or without cataplexy.  
Pitolisant  is  a  potent,  orally  active  histamine  H3-receptor  antagonist/inverse  agonist  which,  via  its 
blockade  of  histamine  auto-receptors  enhances  the  activity  of  brain  histaminergic  neurons,  a  major 
arousal system with widespread projections to the whole brain.  
Pitolisant also modulates various neurotransmitter systems, increasing acetylcholine, noradrenaline and 
dopamine release in the brain. However no increase in dopamine release in the striatal complex including 
nucleus  accumbens  was  evidenced  for  pitolisant.  Pitolisant  has  been  developed  in  adult  patients  with 
narcolepsy with or without cataplexy through Phase II and Phase III clinical studies, with an overall good 
tolerance  and  favourable  efficacy  results.  Pitolisant  significantly  reduced  the  diurnal  somnolence 
compared to placebo, confirming its wakening effect against EDS on the ESS and demonstrating its anti-
cataplectic effect when administrated on an individual titration scheme established on basis of individual 
benefit/tolerance ratio. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The MAH did not seek Protocol assistance at the CHMP. 
A Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) for pitolisant was submitted in 2012 and granted for paediatric age 
subsets 6 to less than 18 years, and with a waiver granted in 0 to less than 6 years based on the grounds 
that the disease practically does not occur in this paediatric age subset. 
Recently,  in  May  2022,  the  compliance  was  checked  and  considered  fulfilled,  once  some  requests 
Assessment report

regarding the Statistical Analysis Plan and change of the primary endpoint have been solved. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
A pharmacokinetic study (P11-11, single oral dose of 20 mg pitolisant) in patients with narcolepsy aged 
6 to less than 18 years was conducted as a prerequisite for the paediatric trial P11-06 and has already 
been  submitted  and  assessed  in  2017  (variation  EMEA/H/C/002616/II/0007).  The  study  was  also 
recently published by Lecendreux and colleagues [Lecendreux et al. 2020] and the conclusion was “After 
single-dose  administration,  the  exposure  parameters  of  pitolisant  were  significantly  greater  in  the 
younger  paediatric  patients  (aged  6  to<12  years)  compared  with  older  paediatric  patients  (aged  12 
to<18  years)  with  narcolepsy.  Compared  with  adults,  pitolisant  exposure  was  approximately  twofold 
higher in the older paediatric group and approximately threefold higher in the younger paediatric group, 
which  was  partially  explained  by  differences  in  body  weight.  Titration  of  pitolisant  to  17.8  mg/d  was 
considered appropriate for younger children (body weight<40 kg), and dose increases up to a maximum 
of 35.6 mg/d for older adolescents who are approaching the adult range of body weight”.  
The analysis of clinical information relevant to dosing recommendations for children and adolescents 6-
18  years  is  based  on  the  results  of  the  pharmacokinetics  study  (P11-11)  and  information  already 
presented for Wakix and authorised in adults (not exceeding the dose of 40 mg/d). Overall, for the same 
weight, pitolisant exposure was roughly comparable, regardless of the age, suggesting that body weight 
was of more influence on PK variation than age. Therefore, in order to not overexpose paediatric patients 
with a body weight below 40 kg, the maximum daily dose of pitolisant was limited to 20 mg for those 
patients.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new information on pharmacodynamics are provided which is acceptable. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The aim of study P11-11 study was to specify the PK parameters of pitolisant administered on a single 
oral dose of 20 mg in patients from 6 to less than 18 years. For the same weight pitolisant exposure was 
roughly comparable, regardless of the age, suggesting that body weight was of more influence on PK 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/180217/2023  
Page 10/70 
 
 
 
variation than age. Thus, it seemed reasonable, in order to not overexpose paediatric patients with a 
body weight below 40 kg, to limit the maximum daily dose of pitolisant to 20 mg. For paediatric patients 
with a body weight > 40 kg, the recommended posology scheme as displayed for adults in the SmPC is 
applicable.  This  single  oral  daily  dose  is  in  accordance  with  the  PK  conclusion  of  variation 
EMEA/H/C/002616/II/0007. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacology aspect of this application are addressed sufficiently.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Main study 
Title of Study: P11-06 Study 
Double-blind,  multicentre,  randomized,  placebo-controlled  trial  to  evaluate  safety  and  efficacy  of 
pitolisant in children from 6 to less than 18 years with narcolepsy with/without cataplexy, followed by a 
prolonged open-label period.   
Methods 
This  is  a  double-blind,  multicentre,  randomized,  placebo-controlled  study  to  evaluate  the  safety  and 
efficacy  of  pitolisant  in  children  aged  from  6  to  less  than  18  years  with  narcolepsy  with  or  without 
cataplexy  meeting  the  International  Classification  of  Sleep  Disorders  Third  Edition  (ICSD-3)  criteria 
(narcolepsy type 1 and type 2). 
The study was planned to include 108 patients, more or less (at least 40%) equally balanced between 
age groups (6 to 11 years and 12 to17 years) and sex.  
A schematic of the study design for the double-blind period is presented in Figure 1: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/180217/2023  
Page 11/70 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1: Study Design – Part 1 Double-Blind Period 
The  study  comprised  a  28-day  screening  period  that  included  a  2-week  baseline  period,  an  8-week 
double blind period (treatment with pitolisant or placebo, from V2 [D0] to V7 [D56]), a 1-week single 
blind washout period (placebo treatment, from V7 [D56] to V8 [D63]), and a currently ongoing prolonged 
open-label period with pitolisant treatment for patients willing to continue in the study. 
There were 3 protocol amendments, with amendment 1 applicable only in France and amendments 2 
and 3 applicable in all participating countries: 
• Protocol Version 1.01 (France) dated 01 February 2016, 
• Protocol Version 2.0 (all countries) dated 19 June 2018, 
• Protocol Version 3.0 (all countries) dated 30 September 2020. 
The main changes were summarized in Table 2: 
Assessment report

Table 2: Protocol Amendments 
The main issue was the change of the primary endpoint scale to UNS instead of PDSS and update of the 
main secondary endpoints accepted within the framework of the third amendment.  Their justification is 
described in the endpoint criteria section below. 
For the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, some special measures were introduced to limit the risk for 
the patient to spread/acquire the infection (Protocol Amendment 3 dated 30 September 2020): 
• Study site visits could be replaced by telephone visits. During these calls, the investigator assessed 
the efficacy and tolerance and adjusted the dose of treatment accordingly, when relevant; 
• Direct shipment of study treatment from the site, or hospital pharmacy, to the patient’s home. Patients 
returned all medication at their subsequent site visit. Diaries to be documented daily were sent to the 
patient with the study treatment. 
An independent DSMB followed the progress of the clinical study and monitored safety data. 
Study participants 
The main inclusion criteria for this study were as follows: 
1. Male and female children from 6 to less than 18 years of age (at V8) suffering from narcolepsy with 
or  without  cataplexy  –  meeting  the  ICSD-3  criteria  (narcolepsy  type  1  and  type  2).  The  diagnosis  is 
confirmed with polysomnography and Multiple Sleep Latency Test MSLT for patients without cataplexy if 
these examinations had not been performed within the last 12 months. 
2. PDSS score ≥ 15 during baseline period (V1+V2)/2. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/180217/2023  
Page 13/70 
 
 
 
 
3.  Patients  free  of  non-authorized  medication,  in  particular  psychostimulant  treatments  as  from  the 
screening visit (V0) onwards. 
4.  Use  of  an  efficient  birth  control  method,  throughout  the  study  and  during  the  month  following 
treatment discontinuation, for pubescent female. 
The main specific non-inclusion criteria are as follows:  
1.  Any  other  conditions  that  could  have  been  considered  the  primary  causes  of  EDS  (sleep  related 
breathing  disorders,  chronic  sleep  deprivation,  circadian  sleep  wake  rhythm  disorder,  or  any  other 
medical or neurological causes);  
- Treatment by anticataplectics, if not stable since at least 4 weeks at the time of inclusion 
- Treatment by tricyclic antidepressants (clomipramine, imipramine …) because they display histamine 
H1 receptor antagonist activity. They can possibly interfere with the effect of pitolisant by abrogating 
the effect of endogenous histamine released in brain by pitolisant. 
- Any significant abnormality of the ECG and particularly QTcF (QTcF=QT/3√ 60/HR) higher than 450 
ms. 
The inclusion and non-inclusion criteria are appropriate for the aim of the study.  
Patients were allowed to continue their anti-cataplectic drugs (including sodium oxybate) if they were at 
a stable dosage for at least 4 weeks before the inclusion visit (V2) and maintained at a stable dosage 
throughout the study (from V2 to V8). The previous use of drugs with a psychotropic effect, including 
psychostimulants  for  the  treatment  of  EDS  (amphetamine  and  amphetamine-like  CNS  stimulants, 
methylphenidate,  or  others  such  as  modafinil)  or  medication  with  sedating  properties  (e.g., 
benzodiazepines,  non-benzodiazepine  anxiolytics,  hypnotics  sedatives,  neuroleptics,  opioids, 
antihistaminic products (1st generation), and anticonvulsants) should have been discontinued at V0 (D-
28). 
Treatments 
Following the completion of inclusion procedures, patients were randomized to treatment with pitolisant 
or  placebo  in  a  2:1  ratio.  Study  treatment  was  to  be  taken  orally  every  day  in  the  morning  before 
breakfast. 
The  total  treatment  duration  of  the  double-blind  period  was  8  weeks.  Patients  started  pitolisant  or 
placebo treatment with escalating doses scheme on the first 4 weeks. The dosage regimen during the 8-
week double-blind period is described below. 
•  Week 1: Pitolisant at 5 mg/day (1 tablet of pitolisant 5 mg) or placebo for 7 days. 
•  Week 2: Pitolisant at 10 mg/day (2 tablets of pitolisant 5 mg) or placebo for 7 days. 
•  Week  3:  The  dose  could  be  increased  to  20  mg/day,  or  maintained  at  the  same  level  i.e.  10 
mg/day,  or  reduced  to  5  mg/day,  depending  on  investigator’s  assessment  of  efficacy  and 
tolerability or placebo for 7 days. 
•  Week 4: The dose could be increased to up to 40 mg/day, or maintained at the same level i.e. 
20 mg/day, or reduced to 10 or 5 mg/day, depending on investigator’s assessment of efficacy 
and tolerability or placebo for 7 days: 
The dosing scheme with a weekly uptitration is in accordance with the SmPC currently recommendations 
for adults. Treatment dosage at 40 mg/day was not allowed for patients with a weight of ˂40 kg. Indeed, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/180217/2023  
Page 14/70 
 
 
 
for these patients, the maximum allowed dosage is 20 mg/day (in agreement with PK data as assessed 
in 2017 from study P11-11). 
The  use  of  a  placebo  group  in  this  study  was  justified  to  obtain  reliable  scientific  evidence  for  the 
evaluation of pitolisant in this pediatric population. Given the small population size and the rarity of the 
disease, the choice of this study design (2:1 ratio for pitolisant or placebo) was deemed appropriate, to 
ensure minimal exposure to placebo for a vulnerable population. 
Objectives 
Primary objective 
The primary objective of this study is to compare pitolisant to placebo, with regard to EDS on the one 
hand, and to the number of cataplexy episodes, if any, on the other hand. 
This study is characterizing the efficacy of pitolisant (5-, 10-, 20-, 40 mg/day in the double-blind period 
and  5-,  10-,  15-,  20-,  30-,  40  mg/day  in  the  open-label  period)  compared  to  placebo  in  showing  an 
incremental improvement to the situation particularly in terms of a reduction of EDS as measured by the 
Ullanlinna Narcolepsy Scale (UNS), and also on the number of cataplexy episodes, if any. 
Secondary objectives 
The secondary objectives of this study are to assess, between groups: 
• Changes in EDS measured: 
− By the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT); 
− By the Pediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale (PDSS); 
− By the Child and Adolescent Sleepiness Scale (CASS); 
• Changes in number of cataplexy episodes per weeks, recorded in sleep diary by patient 
and/or parent/teacher; 
• Severity of EDS and cataplexy measured by the Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-
S) and Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C); 
• Differences in weekly frequency of cataplexy episodes, recorded in sleep diary by patient 
and/or parent/teacher; 
• Changes in the Test of Everyday Attention for Children (TEA-Ch) test; 
• Comparison in withdrawal symptoms questionnaire; 
• Comparison in patient’s global opinion (PGO) on treatment effect at the end of treatment; 
• Clinical and biological tolerance of pitolisant. 
The secondary objectives (changes in EDS, changes in number of cataplexy episodes per weeks, severity 
of  EDS  and  cataplexy,  differences  in  weekly  frequency  of  cataplexy  episodes,  changes  in  the  Test  of 
Everyday Attention for Children and comparison in patient’s global opinion)  are relevant  objectives in 
accordance with the requested assessments for this kind of condition in support to the primary objective.  
The comparison in withdrawal symptoms and the clinical and biological tolerance of pitolisant are further 
assessed in the safety part of this AR.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  changes  in  UNS  measuring  the  intensity  and  frequency  of 
symptoms of narcolepsy (EDS and cataplexies), based on the change from baseline (mean of two pre-
treatment measures at [(V1 + V2)/2]) of the UNS score and at the end of double-blind period (mean of 
the last two measures [(V6 + V7)/2]). 
- The UNS is an 11-item scale used to measure the intensity and frequency of symptoms of narcolepsy 
(EDS and cataplexy) which was validated in 1994 by Hublin et al with high level of sensitivity and of 
specificity therefore considered as an accurate scale for assessment of the symptoms of the narcoleptic 
syndrome. The first 4 items address typical manifestations of cataplexy occurring when laughing, 
becoming glad or angry, or in an exciting situation. The 7 other items measure the sleep latency and 
the propensity to fall asleep in various situations.  
The response to treatment according to UNS was categorized as follows: 
• The cataplexy score (UNS-CTP): Sum of the first 4 items (knees unlocking symptoms, mouth opening 
symptoms, head nodding symptoms, and falling down symptoms); 
• The EDS score (UNS-EDS): Sum of the other 7 items (fall asleep during reading, fall asleep during 
travelling, fall asleep during standing, fall asleep during eating, fall asleep during other unusual, fast to 
fall asleep the evening, and sleep during the day). 
The total score varies from 0 to 44, with higher scores denoting greater narcoleptic tendencies. The 
UNS was evaluated at V1 and V2 (i.e., prior to randomization) as baseline evaluation and at V6 and V7 
(i.e., end of the double-blind period). 
A responder was defined by a score reduction of at least 3 points between the PDSS at baseline and 
the PDSS final value. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was initially planned to be the PDSS, which evaluates EDS. The protocol 
was later amended (third protocol amendment) to use the UNS as the primary efficacy endpoint. The 
rationale for this change was that the UNS demonstrates better reliability, does not vary with 
unspecific conditions (demographic variables), and has higher sensitivity to change compared with the 
PDSS. In addition, the UNS evaluates both therapeutic targets i.e., the major narcolepsy symptoms of 
EDS and cataplexy.  
Secondary endpoints 
The following secondary efficacy endpoints in pitolisant and placebo groups were assessed in the Part 1 
Double-Blind Period of the study: 
• Changes in EDS measured by the PDSS between baseline ([V1 score (D-14) + V2 score (D0)]/2) and 
the end of treatment ([V6 score (D49) + V7 score (D56)]/2); 
• Changes in Ullanlinna Narcolepsy Scale-cataplexy (UNS-CTP) between baseline ([V1 score (D-14) + 
V2 score (D0)]/2) and the end of treatment ([V6 score (D49) + V7 score (D56)]/2). This subscore is 
defined as the sum of the first 4 items of the UNS; 
• Changes in the average number of cataplexy episodes per weeks (weekly rate of cataplexy [WRC]) 
(recorded in  sleep diary by patient and/or parent/teacher) between the 2 weeks of baseline (V1, V2) 
and the 2 weeks of end study treatment period (V6, V7); 
•  Differences  in  weekly  frequency  of  cataplexy  episodes  (recorded  in  sleep  diary  by  patient  and/or 
parent/teacher) between baseline and the 4 weeks of stable treatment period (V5 to V7); 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/180217/2023  
Page 16/70 
 
 
 
• Changes in EDS as measured by the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) between baseline (V2) 
and V7. 
- The PDSS (Pediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale) is a sum score with 8 items leading to a score range 
of 0 to 32. A score >13 is considered as abnormal sleepiness. This scale has been validated in 2003 by 
Drake et al. (The Pediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale (PDSS): Sleep habits and school outcomes in 
middle-school children. Sleep 2003). 
The PDSS is a simple instrument constituted by 8 items: “How often do you fall asleep or get drowsy 
during class periods”; “How often do you get sleepy or drowsy while doing your homework”; “Are you 
usually alert most of the day”; “How often are you ever tired and grumpy during the day”... 
Each of the 8 questions is rated from 0=never, 1=seldom, 2=sometimes, 3=often, frequently to 
4=very often, always. The total score ranges between 0 and 32 with higher scores representing 
greater sleepiness. A score >13 is considered as abnormal sleepiness. 
The PDSS was evaluated at each study visit from V1 to V8, or at the early withdrawal visit and 
reviewed by the investigator. The PDSS should have been administrated to the patient at 
approximately the same time of the visit day and with same delay after the investigational treatment 
intake in order to standardize the possible impact of the treatment on the evaluation. 
The patient should have been helped in the comprehension of the questionnaire until he/she fully 
understood the 8 questions of the score. The patient was to be reminded that the PDSS measures the 
subjective sleepiness with regard to the immediate past week. 
- The cataplexy score (UNS-CTP): see above, a component of the primary endpoint focused on 
cataplexy. 
- The WRC (Weekly Rate of Cataplexy) is the weekly frequency of cataplexy episodes, recorded in 
sleep diary by patient and/or parent/teacher whose differences are measured at different steps, either 
at the end of treatment compared to baseline or during the 4 weeks of stable treatment period 
compared to baseline.  
- The MWT was used in this study to assess an individual’s ability to remain awake while resisting the 
pressure to fall asleep. Patients were administrated four 30-minute MWT sessions at 2-hour intervals 
at the inclusion visit (V2) and at the endpoint visit (V7 or the last on-study visit), according to 
validated standard (Doghramji et al. 1997 where the MWT appears to be a useful procedure in 
differentiating groups with normal daytime wake tendency from those with impaired wake tendency). 
Sample size 
The  initial  protocol  was  based  in  assuming  a  Pearson  correlation  coefficient  of  R=0.5  between  pre-
baseline and final values of PDSS, two pre-baseline measurements [(V1+V2)/2] and two post-baseline 
measurements [(V6+ V7)/2]. A standardized mean difference of at least 0.5 (considered as the minimum 
clinically significant difference) would have been detected at a two-sided 0.05 confidence level with a 
power of at least 0.8, when the sample size/group was at least 20 and 40 patients for control and tested 
drug groups, respectively. 
The sample size was based on the value of the assumed standardize mean difference and the correlation 
between baseline and final values (R). Over- or under-estimation or R was possible. An estimation of R 
would be found, blind to treatment, when at least 20 patients had completed the study producing an 
80%  half  interval  length  of  R.  In  case  where  the  difference  between  the  observed  R’  values  and  the 
expected R was such that |R-R’|>1 the sample size was to be recalculated and discussed with the DSMB. 
Initially,  at  least  60  patients  were  required  to  evaluate  the  primary  endpoints  (40  patients  being 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/180217/2023  
Page 17/70 
 
 
 
administered pitolisant, and 20 patients receiving placebo). Besides, the analysis of sample size justified 
in the context of an adaptive sample size was performed on 29 enrolled patients including 27 randomized 
patients and among them 25 patients provided endpoints values at V6 and V7. The statistical outcomes 
highlighted the need for increase of the sample size. At least 96 patients (64 patients being administrated 
pitolisant,  and  32  patients  receiving  placebo)  were  needed  for  a  power  of  at  least  0.75,  given  the 
observed values of standard deviation (SD) and baseline correlation. 
At a later stage, UNS measuring EDS and cataplexy was used as the primary outcome instead of the 
PDSS. As UNS was expected with a residual variability larger than PDSS, the initial power of 0.75 was 
judged  as  too  small,  and  a  recalculation  of  the  sample  size  was  performed  on  a  standardized  mean 
difference of 0.5 on the UNS (considered as the minimum clinically significant difference), a ratio 1:2, 
and a correlation R=0.4. Under these assumptions, and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) test at 0.05 
two-sided confidence level, the probability of a significant effect would be found with a power of 0.85 
when the sample size exceeded 36+72 patients for control and tested drug groups, respectively, thus a 
total of 108 patients. 
The sample size was planned to show with 85% power and a 5% 2-sided type 1 error rate, a standardized 
mean  difference  of  0.5  (effect  size)  based  on  the  UNS  score,  with  a  ratio  of  1:2  and  a  correlation 
coefficient of 0.4, which is considered acceptable.  
Sample size calculation is based on the standardized mean difference which is not easily interpretable 
from a pure clinical point of view.  
Randomisation 
During the double-blind period patients were randomized to treatment with pitolisant or placebo in a 2:1 
ratio  according  to  a  pre-defined  randomization  list.  Randomization  and  double-blinding  were  used  to 
minimize bias in treatment allocation and in the assessment of safety and efficacy, and minimize bias 
arising from the expectations of the investigators, individuals who collected the study data, and patients 
and/or  their  parent(s)/guardian(s).  Randomization  was  stratified  by  study  centre.  There  was  no  pre-
allocation  of  randomization  blocks  to  a  specific  centre.  Allocation  of  randomization  blocks  was  made 
automatically by the system during randomization. 
Blinding (masking) 
The patient, investigator, and other study personnel remained blinded regarding the treatment assigned 
to the patients throughout the 8-week double-blind period. 
Packaging and treatment boxes were identical in appearance in pitolisant and placebo groups. 
In the situation where the knowledge of the treatment appeared imperative and urgent, a procedure to 
open  the  code  for  the  individual  patient  existed.  A  set  of  sealed  envelopes,  identified  by  the  study 
number, contained the type of treatment assigned to the corresponding patient. These envelopes must 
have only been opened in cases where there was an imperative need to know the assigned treatment to 
protect the patient’s health and well-being, such as voluntary or involuntary overdosing. The code break 
was to be documented on the envelope and in the patient’s eCRF, with date and time and reasons of 
disclosure  and  signed  by  the  investigator.  All  envelopes  were  to  be  tracked  by  the  Sponsor  at  the 
completion of the study.

Statistical methods 
Analysis Sets and Subgroups: 
• Screened Set: all patients with an ICF signed; 
• Randomized Set (RS): all randomized patients; 
• Full Analysis Set (FAS): in accordance with the ITT principle and Section 5.2.1 of the ICH E9 guideline, 
all  randomized  patients  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  study  treatment and  who  had  at  least  one 
baseline value of UNS (primary efficacy criterion) 
• Per Protocol Set (PPS): all patients in the FAS without any major protocol deviation and having one 
total score UNS value at V6 or V7. A protocol deviation was major when it had a possible effect on the 
outcome. As to whether a deviation was major or minor was agreed during the Blind Review Meeting. 
The Per Protocol (PP) analysis was conducted at the condition that its sample size should be less than 
90% of the FAS. 
• Safety Set: all patients who received at least one treatment dose. 
All  efficacy  analyses  were  performed  by  randomized  treatment  group  in  the  FAS  and  PPS.  All  safety 
analyses were performed by actual treatment group in the Safety Set. There were no interim analyses 
planned for this study. 
The following four subgroups were used in some analyses: 
• Age at baseline ([6-11], [12-18[). 
• Sex. 
• Body mass index (BMI) at baseline (underweight, normal, overweight, and obese). 
• Type of narcolepsy (type 1 or type 2). 
Descriptive Statistics 
Continuous  variables  were  described  using  number  of  non-missing  observations,  number  of  missing 
observations, arithmetic mean, standard deviation (SD), minimum, quartile 1 (Q1), median, quartile 3 
(Q3), and maximum. The 95% two-sided confidence interval (CI) was calculated when appropriate using 
the standard method (Standard normal distribution). 
Categorical  variables  were  presented  using  number  of  non-missing  observations,  number  of  missing 
observations, and percentages (%). 
Pitolisant  and  placebo  groups  comparison  –  main  inferential  model:  The  significance  of  the 
difference between pitolisant compared with placebo was assessed through a general model of analysis 
of covariance (ANCOVA) in which the studied endpoint at final time (noted Yf) constituted the dependent 
variable of the model. Independent variables were (1) the baseline value of the studied endpoint (noted 
Yb) analyzed as a fixed covariate, (2) the treatment effect (Noted Trt) coded 0 (placebo) or 1 (pitolisant) 
(cell  mean  contrast  formulation),  and  (3)  the  center  considered  as  a  random  factor  of  the  intercept 
constituted by a fixed part k0 and a random component N(0,σc). 
This model is summarized by the following expression: 
Yif=(k0+ζ) + kb Yb + kt Trt + ϵi ϵi=N(0,σ ) and ζ=N(0,σc) [general Model -1 ] 
-This  model  does  not  assume  a 
treatment-baseline 
interaction 
term 
(as 
required 
in 
EMA/CHMP/295050/2013). The decision of using center as a random factor is justified by the useless

Page 19/70 
 
 
 
estimate of each center, in focusing on the measurement of the SD of the intercept. The treatment was 
considered as fixed factor without center random component. 
-This model is a linear mixed model (LMM) as it combines random and fixed factors, assumes linearity 
of  baseline  and  hypothesizes  the  studied  endpoint  distributed  according  to  a  normal  (Gaussian) 
distribution. This model constitutes the main model used in this study for all the studied endpoints unless 
otherwise specified. 
Pitolisant and placebo groups comparison – multiple testing: The main analysis was defined as 
the ANCOVA following general Model 1 conducted on the main selection (FAS), on the primary endpoint 
(UNS)  considered  as  a  global  endpoint  aggregating  both  EDS  and  cataplexy  symptoms.  Secondary 
endpoints were PDSS and the UNS-CTP subscale measuring the pitolisant effect on EDS and cataplexy, 
respectively. Two other secondary endpoints were the WRC measured by the patient diary and the MWT. 
All the other endpoints were considered as exploratory and supportive. 
The main endpoint (UNS) and the four secondary  endpoints necessitated 5  tests. The fixed-sequence 
strategy was used testing the endpoints in the pre-defined order UNS, PDSS, UNS-CTP, WRC, and MWT, 
each one tested at two-sided alpha=0.05 significance, moving to the following endpoint conditionally to 
a  significant  difference  reached  on  the  previous  endpoints  (Food  and  Drug  Administration.  Multiple 
endpoints in clinical trials guidance for industry, 2017, section C.5). This strategy protected the results 
with type 1 risk bounded by p=0.05. 
Missing data: Missing data were imputed for the five main endpoints of this study (UNS, PDSS, UNS-
CTP, WRC, and MWT). For the other endpoints, no missing value was imputed. A multiple imputation 
(MI) procedure was used to impute the missing evaluations, as a prior step, assuming that those patients 
would be in their randomized arm.  
Primary Efficacy Endpoint Methodology  
The primary efficacy endpoint was defined as the change from baseline to final value in the total UNS 
raw score. 
1-Primary Analysis  
In order to meet the primary objective of the study, the superiority of pitolisant compared to placebo on 
efficacy after an 8-week treatment period was assessed, from the UNS total score expressed in terms of 
change from baseline to final value. After a MI, the main inferential model with the centre as random 
effect was used.  
The  primary  estimand  for  the  primary  endpoint  of  the  study  is  defined  with  mixed  strategies  for 
intercurrent events (based on the estimand terminology).  
A summary of the main endpoint according to the Estimand Notation (ICH E9R1) is provided in Table 3.

Page 20/70 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 3: Primary Endpoint According to the Estimand Notation 
2-Sensitivity and Other Analyses 
Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the primary analysis results:  
• Using MNAR option of the MI imputation (removing the treatment effect in the imputation model of the 
partially complete data sets);  
•  Using  the  same  model  as  for  the  primary  analysis,  with  the  center  as  fixed  factor  effect  instead  of 
random effect;  
•  Using  the  same  model  as  for  the  primary  analysis,  with  in  addition  the  oxybate  sodium  intake  and 
treatment-by-oxybate sodium intake interaction as fixed effects;  
•  Using  an  observed  cases  analysis,  the  same  model  as  for  the  primary  analysis  was  performed  in 
patients  having  a  value  of  UNS  total  score  at  V6  or  V7  (i.e.,  in  this  case  analysis  was  restricted  to 
completers of the double-blind period);  
• Using the same model as for the primary analysis performed by actual treatment group, only if the 
actual group was different from the randomized group.  
The same statistical elements to estimate the treatment effect as for primary analysis were provided.  
Intermediate Analyses  
A  one–stage  futility  stopping  was  based  on  Conditional  Power  (CP),  probability  to  detect  a  significant 
result at the end of the study, given the results observed at an intermediate time. CP was estimated 
through B-values [29, 30]. This analysis was originally planned when at least 20 patients were available, 
and  futility  threshold  was  Cpmin=.10  involving  a  slight  increase  of  type  2  error  (β=0.1/.9=.111-
.10
.01).  
≅
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/180217/2023  
Page 21/70 
 
 
 
 
This analysis was delayed due to necessity of reconsideration of the sample size and a proposal of change 
of the main endpoint to be approved by the European Medicines Agency.  
The futility analysis was performed through treatment-blind computerized calculation. The futility test 
did  not  detect  a  value  of  CP  ˂0.05  and  the  conclusion  was  that  the  study  may  resume  following  the 
current conditions. 
Overall, the statistical plan is considered acceptable. A linear mixed model was used to evaluate the UNS 
total score expressed in terms of change from baseline to final value after imputation of missing data. 
The center was included in the model as a random variable which is considered appropriate. However, 
there  was  a  discrepancy  in  the  planning  and  the  reporting  of  the  results  of  the  intermediate  futility 
analysis.

Table 4: Disposition of Patients in the Part 1 Double-Blind Period 
A total of 110 patients were enrolled and randomized in the study: 72 patients in the pitolisant group 
and 38 patients in the placebo group. 
107 patients (97.3%) completed Part 1 of the study to V7 (to the end of the 8-week double blind period), 
including a similar percentage of patients in the pitolisant group (97.2%) and the placebo group (97.4%). 
Three patients withdrew consent and discontinued from the study during this period (2 patients in the 
pitolisant group and 1 patient in the placebo group). 
106  patients  (96.4%)  completed  Part  1  of  the  study  to  V8  (to  the  end  of  the  1-week  single  blind 
washout),  including  a  similar  percentage  of  patients  in  the  pitolisant  group  (95.8%)  and  the  placebo 
group (97.4%). One patient in the pitolisant group withdrew consent and discontinued from the study 
during the 1-week single blind washout period. 
The patients’ disposition is well-balanced in both treatment groups. The sample size was increased 
twice through amendment 2 and 3 to get at least 108 patients assessed, which is reached with 110 
patients enrolled and randomized. 
Recruitment 
Conduct of the study 
This study was conducted in 11 centres (with screened patients) in 5 countries (France, 3 centres; 
Finland, 1 centre; Italy, 1 centre; Netherlands, 1 centre; Russia, 5 centres). 
The first patient was included on 06 Jun 2016 and the last patient was included on 09 Jan 2021. The 
last patient completed the follow-up at V8 on 03 Apr 2021. 
The efficacy results should not be affected by the change of the primary endpoint in the middle of the 
study for two main reasons: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/180217/2023  
Page 23/70 
 
 
 
 
1) 
 The change was made when the blinding was maintained (the sponsor was not aware of 
efficacy results and of the differences between groups for each outcome) 
2) 
 The primary endpoint that was chosen lately (UNS) was already considered as a secondary 
endpoint in the first version of the protocol (p11-06-app1611 page 55) which means that it was 
recorded for the patients that were already enrolled in the trial. 
According to the reflection paper on methodological issues in confirmatory clinical trials planned with 
an adaptive design (https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/scientific-guideline/reflection-paper-
methodological-issues-confirmatory-clinical-trials-planned-adaptive-design_en.pdf), as a general rule, 
changing a primary endpoint during the trial is not easy to accept (see ICHE9 statistical principles for 
clinical trials). However, in this trial, 2 criteria were considered to evaluate the efficacy of the 
treatment, UNS measuring EDS and cataplexy, and PDSS measuring EDS. Besides, the change of the 
order of these criteria was done in order to adapt to the evolution of the population, the majority of 
whom were with cataplexy. In addition, the trial was blinded and the endpoint that was primary is now 
key secondary. Therefore, in this case, nothing formally opposes the change even if not recommended 
and efficacy results could be considered reliable throughout the study. 
Baseline data 
• 
The demographic characteristics at inclusion in both treatments groups are displayed in Table 5: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/180217/2023  
Page 24/70 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 5: Demographic Characteristics at Inclusion (RS) 
-  More male than female patients (55.5% and 45.5%, respectively) were randomized in the study. 
This difference was also observed in the two treatment groups: in the pitolisant group, 51.4% 
of patients were male and 48.6% female and, in the placebo group, 63.2% of patients were male 
and 36.8% female.  
According to the protocol, the study was planned to include 108 patients, more or less (at least 40%) 
equally balanced between age groups (6 to 11 years and 12 to 17 years) and sex. Unfortunately, in 
the placebo group, there were only 36.8% female. The MAH did not succeed in getting balance 
between male and female in the placebo group. However, the difference between the sex ratio is 
purely random because there is a satisfactory randomization; this difference may be the consequence 
of the small number of patients in the study (around 100 patients); it is clearly specified in the 
guideline “Guideline on adjustment for baseline covariates in clinical trials, 26 February 2015 
EMA/CHMP/295050/2013 Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use that “Statistical testing for 
baseline imbalance has no role in a trial where the handling of the randomization and blinding has 
been fully satisfactory”. Therefore, only particular attention will be given to the effect of the treatment 
in each of the sex subgroups since the baseline data were not well-balanced. 
- 
The mean (SD) and median (range) age of all patients was 12.9 (3.0) years and 13 (6 to 17) 
years, respectively, and was comparable for patients in the pitolisant group (13.0 [3.0] years) 
and placebo group (12.5 [3.0] years).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/180217/2023  
Page 25/70 
 
 
 
 
Regarding the age distribution, 35 patients (31.8%) were aged 6 to 11 years and 75 patients (68.2%) 
were aged 12 to 18 years. A comparable age group distribution (one third, two thirds) was observed in 
the two treatment groups: in the pitolisant group, 30.6% of patients were aged 6 to 11 years and 69.4% 
aged 12 to 18 years, and in the placebo group, 34.2% of patients were aged 6 to 11 years and 65.8% 
aged 12 to 18 years. 
The proportion of males and females is displayed in Table 6. Patients aged ˂12 years were 62.9% male 
and 37.1% female and patients aged ≥12 years were 52.0% male and 48.0% female 
Table 6: Gender by Age Group at Inclusion – Post-Hoc Analysis (FAS) 
Contrary to what the MAH estimated, the CHMP considered that the gender distribution by age group is 
not well-balanced in both treatment groups since there are around 10% more female in patients aged 
≥12 years or patients aged ˂12 years in the pitolisant group vs placebo group. The same reasoning is 
applied for male distribution, with around 10% less male in patients aged ≥12 years or patients aged 
˂12 years in the pitolisant group vs placebo group. However, since the pathophysiology of narcolepsy 
is not different between male and female, this observation is not likely to have an influence on the 
efficacy results. 
Otherwise 2/3 of patients were over 12 year of age.  
- 
For body mass index (BMI), 48 patients (43.6%) were in normal class, 26 patients (23.6%) were 
in the overweight class, and 36 patients (32.7%) were in the obese class: in the pitolisant group, 
41.7% of patients were in the BMI normal class, 26.4% were in the overweight class, and 31.9% 
were in the obese class and, in the placebo group, 47.4% of patients were in the BMI normal, 
18.4% were in the overweight class, and 34.2% were in the obese class. Slightly (around 6%) 
more patients in the placebo group were in normal class whereas slightly (8%) more patients in 
the pitolisant group were in the overweight class.  
If this BMI distribution would have an impact on efficacy results, a particular attention will be given to 
the effect of the treatment in each of the BMI subgroups. 
- 
The mean (SD) DBP, SBP, and HR were comparable for patients in the pitolisant group and in 
the placebo group. The BP was interpreted as normal for the majority of patients (97.3% overall) 
and was interpreted as abnormal, not clinically significant for 3 patients (2.7%) who were all in 
the placebo group. 
The majority of physical examination results were normal (i.e., without a significant clinical abnormality). 
Clinically significant abnormalities were reported in the following body systems: Neurological in 3 patients 
(2.7%), including 2 patients in the pitolisant group and 1 patient in the placebo group; Dermatologic in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/180217/2023  
Page 26/70 
 
 
 
 
2  patients  (1.8%),  including  2  patients  in  the  pitolisant  group;  General  status  in  2  patients  (1.8%), 
including 1 patient in the pitolisant group and 1 patient in the placebo group and Cardiovascular in 1 
patient (0.9%), including 1 patient in the pitolisant group. 
The interpretation of the ECG was normal for 77 patients (70.0%), including 53 patients (73.6%) in the 
pitolisant  group  and  24  patients  (63.2%)  in  the  placebo  group.  The  ECG  result  was  abnormal,  non-
clinically significant for 32 patients (29.1%), including 18 patients (25.0%) in the pitolisant group and 
14 patients (36.8%) in the placebo group. The ECG could not be evaluated for 1 patient in the pitolisant 
group.  
The fact that the QTCF class was ≤450 msec for all 110 patients (100.0%) is reassuring. 
• 
The patient disease baseline characteristics (narcolepsy baseline disease severity and duration, 
UNS and PDSS scores) are displayed in Table 7: 
Table 7: Narcolepsy Disease, UNS and PDSS Scores at Study Inclusion (RS) 
The baseline disease characteristics were overall comparable between the pitolisant and placebo 
groups. 
The majority of patients (90 patients [81.8%]) had type 1 narcolepsy and 20 patients (18.2%) had 
type 2 narcolepsy. In the pitolisant group, 84.7% of patients had type 1 and 15.3% of patients had 
type 2 narcolepsy. In the placebo group, 76.3% of patients had type 1 and 23.7% of patients had type 
2 narcolepsy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/180217/2023  
Page 27/70 
 
 
 
 
The mean (SD) duration of narcolepsy since confirmed diagnosis for all patients was 1.6 (2.2) years 
(range, 0 to 9 years), and was 1.5 (2.0) years for patients in the pitolisant group and 1.8 (2.5) years 
for patients in the placebo group. 
Consistent with a diagnosis of narcolepsy, the mean (SD) UNS total score for all patients was 24.30 
(8.23), and it was 24.63 (7.80) for patients in the pitolisant group and 23.68 (9.08) for patients in the 
placebo group, considering a cut-off score of 14 for narcolepsy designation when using the UNS scale 
UNS was not an eligibility criteria but an assessment criteria.  
Consistent with the study eligibility criteria, the PDSS score was ≥15, with a mean (SD) PDSS score of 
20.10 (3.57) for all patients, and was 20.16 (3.64) for patients in the pitolisant group and 20.00 
(3.49) for patients in the placebo group. The PDSS total score can range from 0 and 32 and a score 
>13 is considered abnormal sleepiness. 
The narcolepsy-associated symptoms that were recorded at baseline included: hallucinations in 45 
patients (40.9%); automatic behaviour in 39 patients (35.5%); dyssomnia in 68 patients (61.8%) and 
sleep paralysis in 29 patients (26.4%). Most of these narcolepsy-associated events were ongoing in 
around 80% of these patients. 
• 
Prior treatment for narcolepsy 
Overall, 38 patients (34.5%) reported previous treatments for narcolepsy. The percentage of patients 
reporting previous treatments for narcolepsy was slightly higher in the pitolisant group (36.1%) than 
the placebo group (31.6%). 
The  most 
frequently 
reported  previous 
treatments 
for  narcolepsy  were  centrally  acting 
sympathomimetics  reported  by  26  patients  (23.6%)  overall,  including  19  patients  (26.4%)  in  the 
pitolisant group and 7 patients (18.4%) in the placebo group.  
Since the percentage of patients reporting previous treatments for narcolepsy was slightly higher in 
the pitolisant group (36.1%) than the placebo group (31.6%), patients in the pitolisant group may be 
more severe and are mainly treated by centrally acting sympathomimetics. The previous treatment by 
sodium oxybate is similar between pitolisant (15.3%) and placebo group (15.8%).  
Overall, 30 patients (27.3%) reported concomitant treatments during the treatment period (up to V8). 
This was comparable in the pitolisant group (26.4%) and the placebo group (28.9%). 
The most frequently reported concomitant treatment for narcolepsy during the treatment period 
(reported by ≥10% of patients overall) was Sodium oxybate reported by 11 patients (10.0%) overall, 
including 9 patients (12.5%) in the pitolisant group and 2 patients (5.3%) in the placebo group. 
Numbers analysed 
A total of 115 patients were screened and 110 patients were enrolled and randomized. The analysis sets 
were as follows: 
A total of 110 patients were randomized to receive pitolisant (72 patients) or placebo (38 patients) and 
received at least one dose of study treatment, and were therefore included in the RS (randomized set) 
and the FAS. The populations in the RS and FAS were identical. 
Overall,  12  patients  (10.9%)  had  at  least  1  major  protocol  deviation  during  the  study,  with  a  lower 
proportion  of  patients  in  the  pitolisant  group  (8.3%  of  patients)  than  the  placebo  group  (15.8%  of 
patients). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/180217/2023  
Page 28/70 
 
 
 
A total of 97 patients (88.2%) in the FAS did not have any major protocol deviations and had one total 
score  UNS  value  at  V6  or  V7,  and  were  therefore  included  in  the  PPS.  The  PPS  included  65  patients 
(90.3%) in the pitolisant group and 32 patients (84.2%) in the placebo group. 
The Safety Set included 73 patients in the pitolisant group and 37 patients in the placebo group. Five 
(5) patients were provided the treatment kit without the correct randomization procedure (IWRS); 5 
patients did not receive the correct planned treatment. 
Table 8: Summary of Analysis Sets 
The randomized Set is similar to the FAS Set, to the PP Set and to the Safety Set. The number of 
withdrawals is rather low, which could partly be explained by the short duration of study. 
Outcomes and estimation 
•  Extent of exposure 
Treatment duration during the study is summarized by treatment group and for both groups in Table 9. 
The median treatment duration was 56 days for all patients and for patients in the two treatment groups. 
Table 9: Extent of Exposure of Pitolisant (FAS) 
In this 8-week, randomized, double-blind study, patients started with escalating doses of pitolisant or 
placebo from 5 mg/day up to a maximum of 40 mg/day (for patients with a weight of ≥ 40 kg) for the

first 4 weeks, followed by treatment administration at a stable dose for 4 weeks and a 1-week placebo 
period.  Study  treatment  was  taken  every  day  in  the  morning  before  breakfast,  according  to  the 
Investigator’s prescription regarding the dose regimen of patients, based on efficacy and tolerability. 
Overall,  during  the  treatment  stable  dose  period,  1.4%  of  patients  received  5  mg  pitolisant,  15.5% 
received 10 mg pitolisant, 23.9% received 20 mg pitolisant, and 59.2% received 40 mg pitolisant. 
The actual treatment intake in the pitolisant group during the stable dosing period according to age was 
as follows: 
• For patients aged ˂12 years, 22.7% received 10 mg pitolisant, 45.5% received 20 mg pitolisant, 
and 31.8% received 40 mg pitolisant during the stable dose period. 
•  For  patients  aged  ≥12  years,  2.0%  received  5  mg  pitolisant,  12.2%  received  10  mg  pitolisant, 
14.3% received 20 mg pitolisant, and 71.4% received 40 mg pitolisant during the stable dose period. 
The actual treatment intake in the pitolisant group during the stable dosing period according to weight 
was as follows: 
•  For  patients  weighing  ˂40  kg,  30.8%  received  10  mg  pitolisant  and  69.2%  received  20  mg 
pitolisant  during  the  stable  dose  period.  More  than  30%  of  patients  received  a  dose  lower  than  the 
therapeutic dose. 
•  For  patients  weighing  ≥40  kg,  1.7%  received  5  mg  pitolisant,  12.1%  received  10  mg  pitolisant, 
13.8% received 20 mg pitolisant, and 72.4% received 40 mg pitolisant during the stable dose period. 
Table 10: Actual Treatment Intake During the Stable Dose Period According to Weight – 
Post-Hoc Analysis (Safety Set) 
Most patients received a daily dose of 20 mg (23.9%) or 40 mg (59.2%) whatever the age group. As 
recommended, no patient weighing ˂40 kg received a dose > 20 mg daily. For patients weighing ≥ 40 
kg, the majority received a daily dose of 40 mg (72.4%).

Figure 3: Change in the Mean Ullanlinna Narcolepsy Scale Total Score from Baseline to the End of 
Treatment (Full Analysis Set) 
UNS total score by sex: For both male and female patients, the mean change from baseline to end of 
treatment in UNS total score was greater in the pitolisant group than the placebo group. 
UNS total score by age: For patients aged ˂12 years and ≥12 years, the mean change from baseline to 
end of treatment in UNS total score was greater in the pitolisant group than the placebo group, although 
the difference between groups was smaller in the patients aged ˂12 years. 
UNS total score by BMI:  The mean change from baseline to  end of treatment in UNS total score was 
greater in the pitolisant group than the placebo group for patients in the BMI normal and obese classes 
and was similar for patients in the BMI overweight class. 
For the overall population, the mean (SD) UNS scores at baseline were 23.68 (9.08) in the placebo 
group and 24.63 (7.80) in the pitolisant groups. After 8 weeks of treatment, change from baseline to 
end of treatment in UNS total score was - 6.36 (8.59) in the pitolisant group (N=70) and -2.46 (5.55) 
in the placebo group (N=37), indicating a greater improvement in the pitolisant group compared with 
the placebo group (see Figure 3).  
The applicant performed the subgroup analyses for the primary endpoint. In view of the results 
displayed in Table 5 above, the mean UNS change scores are rather consistent in each subgroup (sex, 
age and BMI) with those observed in the main analysis. Sex, age and/or BMI did seemingly have no 
influence on the UNS scores. However the evolution of UNS scores by sex, age and BMI should be 
interpreted with caution because of the low patient numbers in each subgroup and are only of 
descriptive value.  
The primary analysis of the UNS total score between group comparisons in the FAS is summarized in 
Table 12. The UNS total score least squares (LS) mean (SE) of the adjusted difference from baseline to 
the end of treatment was -6.29 (1.14) in the pitolisant group and -2.60 (1.35) in the placebo group. The 
estimate LS means difference (SE) [95% CI] between treatment groups (pitolisant minus placebo) was 
-3.69 (1.37) [-6.38; -0.99], p=0.0073. The UNS total score change between pitolisant and placebo after 
an 8-week treatment period is statistically significant.

Table 12: Ullanlinna Narcolepsy Scale Total Severity Score – Between Group Comparison 
Main Analysis (Full Analysis Set) 
The UNS total score at the end of the double blind period, measured by the difference in LS means 
between pitolisant and placebo (-3.69 (1.37) [-6.38; -0.99]) shows that the difference is statistically 
significant (p=0.0073) and that pitolisant is superior to placebo for the primary outcome measure.  
Some further analyses were conducted for the PPS and the difference in LS means between treatment 
groups (pitolisant minus placebo) was -4.01 (1.52) [-7.03; -0.98], p=0.0100. 
The primary analysis results were supported by the results of all the sensitivity analyses of the UNS 
total score between group comparisons in the FAS (MNAR imputation [p = 0.0079], MAR imputation 
with centre as fixed effect [p = 0.0079], MAR imputation with interaction treatment-by-oxybate 
sodium intake [p = 0.0023], main model in patients without oxybate sodium intake [p = 0.0023], 
observed cases (i.e., completers) [p = 0.0071], and MAR imputation – actual treatment group [p = 
0.0148]). 
•  Secondary endpoints 
1.  Paediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale (PDSS) 
The mean (SD) change from baseline to end of treatment (EoT) in PDSS total score was -5.54 (5.31) in 
the  pitolisant  group  (N=70)  and  -2.09  (6.47)  in  the  placebo  group  (N=37),  indicating  a  greater 
improvement in the pitolisant group compared with the placebo group (Table 13).

The analysis of the PDSS total score between group comparisons in the FAS is summarized in Table 14. 
The PDSS total score LS mean (SE) of the adjusted difference from baseline to the end of treatment was 
-5.53 (0.66) in the pitolisant group and -2.11 (0.89) in the placebo group. After 8 weeks of treatment, 
there was a statistically significant difference between pitolisant and placebo groups on the change in 
PDSS total score (LS means difference (SE) [95% CI]: -3.41 (1.07) [-5.52; -1.31], p = 0.0015). 
Table 14: Paediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale Total Score – Between Group Comparison 
Main Analysis (FAS) 
A  greater  proportion  of  patients  in  the  pitolisant  group  (64.3%  [45/70])  than  in  the  placebo  group 
(40.5% [15/37]) were responders according to the PDSS total score (i.e. patients with a change from 
baseline to end of treatment of at least 3 points on the PDSS). The estimated difference (23.75%; SE 
9.90; 95%CI 4.35; 43.14) was statistically significant in favour of pitolisant after an 8 week treatment 
period (p=0.0186) as seen in Table 15 below:

Table 15: Paediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale Total Score – Response to Treatment Between 
Group Comparison (FAS) 
The mean (SD) change from baseline to end of treatment (EoT) in PDSS total score was -5.54 (5.31) 
in the pitolisant group (N=70) and -2.09 (6.47) in the placebo group (N=37), indicating a greater 
improvement in the pitolisant group compared with the placebo group 
After analysis, the PDSS total score at the end of the double blind period, measured by the difference 
in LS means between pitolisant and placebo (-3.41 (1.07) [-5.52; -1.31]) shows that the difference is 
statistically significant (p=0.0015) and that pitolisant is superior to placebo for the treatment of 
daytime sleepiness associated with narcolepsy. 
The rate of responder (i.e. patients with a change from baseline to end of treatment of at least 3 
points on the PDSS) is of 64.3% [45/70] in the pitolisant group vs 40.5% [15/37] in the placebo 
group, which is statistically significant. 
Similar results were observed in the PPS with a statistically significant difference in favour of pitolisant 
after an 8-week treatment period on the change in PDSS total score. 
The main analysis results were also supported by the results of the sensitivity analyses (MNAR 
imputation [p=0.0021], observed cases (i.e., completers) [p=0.0020] and MAR imputation – actual 
treatment group [p=0.0031]). 
2.  UNS-Cataplexy (UNS-CTP) Subscore 
In patients with type 1 narcolepsy, the mean (SD) change from baseline to end of treatment in UNS CTP 
subscore are displayed in Table 16.

The analysis of the UNS CTP subscore between group comparisons in patients with type 1 narcolepsy in 
the  FAS  using  the  LS  means  of  the  adjusted  difference  from  baseline  to  the  end  of  treatment  is 
summarized in Table 17. 
Table 17: Ullanlinna Narcolepsy Scale-Cataplexy Subcore – Between Group Comparison in 
Patients with Type I Narcolepsy Main Analysis (FAS) 
In patients with type 1 narcolepsy, the mean (SD) change from baseline to end of treatment in UNS 
CTP subscore was -2.83 (3.96) in the pitolisant group (N=60) and -1.27 (3.17) in the placebo group 
(N=28), indicating a greater improvement in the pitolisant group compared with the placebo group 
There was a statistically significant difference in favour of pitolisant after the 8-week treatment period 
on the change in UNS CTP subscore in patients with type 1 narcolepsy (LS means difference (SE) [95% 
CI]: -1.77 (0.78) [-3.29; -0.24]; p = 0.0229). 
The effect of pitolisant remained significant in the PPS (p = 0.0295) and in the sensitivity analyses in 
the FAS (MNAR imputation [p=0.0277], completers (observed cases) imputation [p=0.0284], MAR 
imputation – actual treatment group [p=0.0301]). 
3.  Weekly rate of cataplexie 
In patients with type 1 narcolepsy, the decrease in the WRC was comparable between the two treatment 
groups. The difference between pitolisant and placebo groups on the WRC during the last week of the 
treatment period in the double-blind period was not significant, in patients with type 1 narcolepsy in the 
FAS (p = 0.0540). 
As shown in Table 18 below, in the pitolisant group (N=61), the mean (SD) WRC during baseline, the 
stable dose period and during the last week of the treatment period was 8.63 (17.73), 6.81 (19.73) and 
5.39 (16.52) episodes, respectively. In the placebo group (N=29), the mean (SD) WRC during baseline, 
the stable dose period and the last week of the treatment period, was 13.44 (26.92), 12.29 (22.79) and 
10.73  (18.05)  episodes,  respectively.  The  decrease  in  the  WRC  was  comparable  between  the  two 
treatment groups.

Table 19: Patient Sleep diary – The weekly rate of cataplexy (WRC) – Between group 
Comparison – In type I Narcolepsy patients – Periods calculated according to the first and 
last treatment intake dates – Full Analysis set 
The  LS  mean  (SE)  of  the  WRC  during  the  last  week  of  the  treatment  period  was  2.14  (0.27)  in  the 
pitolisant group and 5.05 (0.37) in the placebo group. The rate defined as the ratio between the WRC 
found on pitolisant group and the WRC found on placebo group adjusted for baseline was 0.42 [95% CI: 
0.18 to 1.01], p=0.0540. This difference is not significant. 
The difference between pitolisant and placebo groups [2.14 (0.27) in the pitolisant group and 5.05 
(0.37) in the placebo group] on the WRC during the last week of the treatment period in the double-
blind phase (D49 to D56) was not significant (p=0.0540), in patients with type 1 narcolepsy in the FAS 
and similar results were observed in the analysis in patients with type 1 narcolepsy in the PPS. The 
results of the main analysis were confirmed in the sensitivity analyses in patients with type 1 
narcolepsy in the FAS. 
A complementary, post-hoc analysis was done on the most severe patients with regards to WRC. The 
proportion of patients with a WRC >15 decreased during the study in the pitolisant group and 
remained stable in the placebo group. Indeed, in the pitolisant group, a WRC >15 was reported for 
16.9% of patients at baseline and 6.7% of patients during the last week of the treatment period. In 
the placebo group, a WRC >15 was reported for 24.1% of patients at baseline and 25.0% of patients 
during the last week of the treatment period. The value of this complementary, post-hoc analysis is 
only descriptive and does not allow to draw any robust conclusion. This could in particular not be used 
as a claim in the SmPC. 
Moreover, considering a hierarchical strategy was used for strategy of controlling the test multiplicity, 
it is worth noting that any significant statistical result beyond this WRC criteria (i.e for the further 
secondary endpoints described below) cannot be taken into account and may only have a descriptive 
value. Since no statistically significant difference in WRC was observed between pitolisant and placebo, 
therefore no efficacy claim on the further criteria is possible from a methodological point of view which

is fortunately the case since clinical results as described in section 5.1 only refer to the primary 
endpoint. 
Of note, in type 1 narcolepsy patients from the FAS, the proportion of patients with no cataplexy all 
along the study (D-14 to D63) was 23.0% in the pitolisant group and 20.7% in the placebo group. 
4.  Weekly frequency of cataplexy episodes 
5.  Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) 
The  MWT  was  used  in  this  study  to  assess  an  individual’s  ability  to  remain  awake  while  resisting  the 
pressure to fall asleep. Patients were administrated four 30-minute MWT sessions at 2-hour intervals at 
the inclusion visit (V2) and at the endpoint visit (V7 or the last on-study visit). 
In the FAS, the mean (SD) of sleep onset latency slightly increased during the study for patients in the 
pitolisant  group  and  remained  more  or  less  stable  for  patients  in  the  placebo  group:  in  the  pitolisant 
group, the mean (SD) of sleep onset latency was 10.14 (7.24)  minutes at baseline and  11.47 (9.08) 
minutes at V7. In the placebo group, the mean (SD) of sleep onset latency was 10.61 (8.26) minutes at 
baseline and 10.19 (8.66) minutes at V7. 
The MWT between group comparison of time to sleep onset analysis in the FAS is summarized in Table 
20. 
Table 20: Maintenance of Wakefulness – Between Group Comparison Time to Sleep Onset 
(FAS) 
According to the MAH, the results of the analysis of the MWT demonstrated favourable efficacy for 
pitolisant compared with placebo. The hazard ratio [95% CI] for the MWT time to sleep onset 
comparison between treatment groups (pitolisant minus placebo) was 0.748 [0.616; 0.903], p=0.004, 
meaning that at every moment of the MWT experiment, about 25% fewer patients in the pitolisant 
group compared with the placebo group fell asleep. 
However, these results are only of descriptive value, all the more considering the hierarchical 
methodology of statistical tests. 
6.  Other efficacy parameters 
The following exploratory efficacy endpoints have been analysed: UNS – Excessive Daytime Sleepiness 
(UNS-EDS) subscore, Clinical Global Impressions (CGI), Child and Adolescent Sleepiness Scale (CASS), 
Test of Everyday Attention for Children (TEA-Ch), Sleep parameters calculated from the patient sleep 
diary and Patient’s Global Opinion (PGO) on the effect of treatment. 
The favourable efficacy results for pitolisant compared with placebo on EDS reduction were also 
supported by exploratory efficacy endpoints measuring the changes in EDS (Child and Adolescent 
Sleepiness Scale [CASS] and UNS-EDS subscore), the severity of EDS assessed by the Investigator 
(Clinical Global Impression of Change [CGI-C]) and the comparison in patient’s global opinion (PGO) 
on treatment effect at the EoT.

This  is  a  double-blind,  multicenter,  randomized,  placebo-controlled  study  to 
evaluate the  safety and efficacy of pitolisant in children aged from 6 to less 
than  18  years  with  narcolepsy  with  or  without  cataplexy  meeting  the 
International  Classification  of Sleep  Disorders  Third  Edition  (ICSD-3)  criteria 
(narcolepsy type 1 and type 2). 
Patients were randomized to treatment with pitolisant or placebo in a 2:1 ratio 
at  the  end  of  the  screening  period  at  study  inclusion.  Randomization  was 
stratified by study center. The study was planned to include 108 patients, more 
or  less  (at  least  40%)  equally  balanced  between  age  groups  (6  to  11  years 
and 12 to 17 years) and sex.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
P11-06  Study,  a  double-blind,  multicentre,  placebo-controlled,  randomised-withdrawal  design  study 
provided some insights into the magnitude of effect of pitolisant that could be seen in children from 6 to 
less  than  18  years  with  narcolepsy  with/without  cataplexy.  The  study  comprised  a  28-day  screening 
period that included a 2-week baseline period, an 8-week double blind period and a 1-week single blind 
washout  period  and  a  currently  ongoing  prolonged  open-label  period  with  pitolisant  treatment  for 
patients willing to continue in the study. 
Given the small population size and the rarity of the disease, the choice of this study design (pitolisant 
or  placebo  in  a  2:1  ratio)  was  deemed  appropriate,  to  ensure  minimal  exposure  to  placebo  for  a 
vulnerable population. 
The inclusion and non-inclusion criteria are appropriate for the aim of the study. Patients were allowed 
to continue their anti-cataplectic drugs (including sodium oxybate) if they were at a stable dosage for at 
least 4 weeks before the inclusion visit and maintained at a stable dosage throughout the study.  
There were three amendments whose main topics were to enhance twice the number of enrolled patients 
as well as to change the primary endpoint from Pediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale (PDSS) to Ullanlinna 
Narcolepsy Scale (UNS), considered more reliable and specific for the paediatric population. The study 
was compliant with the PIP requirements and the requests regarding the SAP and the endpoint reversal 
between the primary and the key secondary endpoint were resolved. 
A total of 110 patients were enrolled and randomized in the study: 72 patients in the pitolisant group 
and 38 patients in the placebo group and three patients withdrew consent and discontinued from the 
study (2 patients in the pitolisant group and 1 patient in the placebo group). The majority of patients 
(90 patients [81.8%]) had type 1 narcolepsy and 20 patients (18.2%) had type 2 narcolepsy reflecting 
the current epidemiology in paediatrics. Two thirds of the patients in the study were over 12 year of age. 
Assessment report

Most patients received a daily dose of 20 mg (23.9%) or 40 mg (59.2%) whatever the age group. As 
recommended, no patient weighing ˂40 kg received a dose > 20 mg daily. For patients weighing ≥ 40 
kg, the majority received a daily dose of 40 mg (72.4%). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Regarding the primary endpoint, for the overall population, change from baseline to end of treatment in 
UNS total score was - 6.36 (8.59) in the pitolisant group (N=70) and -2.46 (5.55) in the placebo group 
(N=37), indicating a greater improvement in the pitolisant group compared with the placebo group. The 
UNS total score at the end of the double blind period, measured by the difference in LS means between 
pitolisant and placebo (-3.69 (1.37) [-6.38; -0.99]) shows that the difference is statistically significant 
(p=0.0073) and that pitolisant is superior to placebo for the primary efficacy outcome. 
Some further analyses were conducted for the PPS and the difference in LS means between treatment 
groups  (pitolisant  minus  placebo)  was  -4.01  (1.52)  [-7.03;  -0.98],  p=0.0100.  The  primary  analysis 
results were supported by the results of all the sensitivity analyses of the UNS total score between group 
comparisons in the FAS (MNAR imputation [p = 0.0079], MAR imputation with centre as fixed effect [p 
=  0.0079], MAR  imputation  with  interaction  treatment-by-oxybate  sodium  intake  [p  = 0.0023],  main 
model in patients without oxybate sodium intake [p = 0.0023], observed cases (i.e., completers) [p = 
0.0071], and MAR imputation – actual treatment group [p = 0.0148]). 
Regarding the secondary endpoints: 
-  PDSS: The mean (SD) change from baseline to end of treatment in PDSS total score was -5.54 
(5.31) in the pitolisant group (N=70) and -2.09 (6.47) in the placebo group (N=37), indicating 
a greater improvement in the pitolisant group compared with the placebo group. After analysis, 
the  PDSS  total  score  at  the  end  of  the  double  blind  period,  measured  by  the  difference  in  LS 
means between pitolisant and placebo (-3.41 (1.07) [-5.52; -1.31]) shows that the difference is 
statistically significant (p=0.0015) and that pitolisant is superior to placebo for the treatment 
day  time  sleepiness  associated  with  narcolepsy.  The  rate  of  responder  (i.e.  patients  with  a 
change from baseline to end of treatment of at least 3 points on the PDSS) is of 64.3% [45/70] 
in the pitolisant group vs 40.5% [15/37] in the placebo group, which is statistically significant. 
Similar  results  were  observed  in  the  PPS  with  a  statistically  significant  difference  in  favour  of 
pitolisant after an 8-week treatment period on the change in PDSS total score. The main analysis 
results  were  also  supported  by  the  results  of  the  sensitivity  analyses  (MNAR  imputation 
[p=0.0021],  observed  cases  (i.e.,  completers)  [p=0.0020]  and  MAR  imputation  –  actual 
treatment group [p=0.0031]). 
-  UNS-CTP: In patients with type 1 narcolepsy, the mean (SD) change from baseline to end of 
treatment in UNS CTP subscore was -2.83 (3.96) in the pitolisant group (N=60) and -1.27 (3.17) 
in the placebo group (N=28), indicating a greater improvement in the pitolisant group compared 
with the placebo group. There was a statistically significant difference in favour of pitolisant 
after the 8-week treatment period on the change in UNS CTP subscore in patients with type 1 
narcolepsy (LS means difference (SE) [95% CI]: -1.77 (0.78) [-3.29; -0.24]; p = 0.0229). The 
effect of pitolisant remained significant in the PPS (p = 0.0295) and in the sensitivity analyses 
in the FAS (MNAR imputation [p=0.0277], completers (observed cases) imputation [p=0.0284], 
MAR imputation – actual treatment group [p=0.0301]). 
-  WRC: The difference between pitolisant and placebo groups [2.14 (0.27) in the pitolisant group 
and 5.05 (0.37) in the placebo group] on the WRC during the last week of the treatment period 
in the double-blind phase (D49 to D56) was not significant (p=0.0540), in patients with type 
1  narcolepsy  in  the  FAS.  A  complementary,  post-hoc  analysis  was  done  on  the  most  severe 
Assessment report

patients with regards to WRC. The proportion of patients with a WRC >15 decreased during the 
study in the pitolisant group and remained stable in the placebo group. Indeed, in the pitolisant 
group, a WRC >15 was reported for 16.9% of patients at baseline and 6.7% of patients during 
the last week of the treatment period. In the placebo group, a WRC >15 was reported for 24.1% 
of patients at baseline and 25.0% of patients during the last week of the treatment period. The 
value of this complementary, post-hoc analysis is only descriptive and does not allow to draw 
any robust conclusion. This could in particular not be used as a claim in the SmPC.  
The Applicant provided clarification and justification to the uncertainties and limitations about favourable 
effects regarding the UNS. 
First, the switch from the paediatric daytime sleepiness scale to the Ullanlinna narcolepsy scale score 
has been clarified and justified by the Applicant. Indeed, the design of the paediatric study focused on 
EDS  and  not  on  cataplexy,  with  the  PDSS  as  the  primary  endpoint  to  evaluate  in  this  population  the 
change  in  EDS  and  not  the  cataplexy  before  changing  the  primary  endpoint  according  to  the  efficacy 
results in 2015 of pitolisant on cataplexy in adults. Moreover, the Paediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale 
(PDSS) as primary outcome in pediatrics was approved on 6 July 2012 by the PDCO and the detailed 
justification  for  the  replacement  of  the  PDSS  by  the  Ullanlinna  narcoleptic  scale  as  the  new  primary 
endpoint was approved by the PDCO in June 2020 (EMEA-001176-PIP01-11-M05). Both endpoints were 
present since the beginning of the study.  
Second, the data displaying a summarized comparison of metric characteristics of PDSS and UNS scales, 
show that the UNS scale seems more reliable than the PDSS scale, as an overall symptom measurement 
tool for narcolepsy, based on blinded data from 91 patients analyzed in Lehert 2022 and supplementary 
materials. In agreement with the Applicant's response, UNS scale can be considered as reliable: indeed, 
reliability is measured by the Cronbach alpha which is greater than 0.6 for the UNS scale of 0.80 [0.75, 
0.85], and the intra-class correlation (ICC) which is close to 1, of 0.87. These two metrics for the UNS 
scale are higher than those for the PDSS scale with an alpha Cronbach of 0.72 [0.66, 0.76] and an ICC 
of 0.60. Moreover, the validity measured by the standardized sensitivity and correlation coefficient (R) 
with perceived status seem similar for both scales. The standardized sensitivity of the UNS scale of 0.55 
[0.44, 0.59] is very close to that of the PDSS scale of 0.53 [0.43, 0.58]. The correlation coefficient of 
the UNS scale of 0.64 is close to that of the PDSS scale of 0.55. 
Third, the determination of the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of UNS total score of -3.3 
and its 2 sub-scores were performed with a justification based on a statistical model (Lehert 2022 and 
supplementary materials) without argument and clinical data. However, based on standardized results 
(see statistical aspects below), a medium clinically relevant and statistically significant treatment effect 
has  been  observed  with  UNS  and  PDSS  scales.  It  would  have  been  preferable  if  the  Applicant  had 
mentioned  the  validation  of  the  UNS  scale  in  the  pediatric  population,  based  on  Lehert  2022  and 
supplementary materials, as well as the MID for the total score of -3.3 and its 2 sub-scores, and also its 
reproducibility, even though it was not yet published, so that it would not have been the subject of a 
remark by the authorities. 
Fourth,  the  validation  of  the  UNS  scale  in  the  paediatric  population  is  based  on  Lehert  data  and  UNS 
proposed to the EMA as primary endpoint was endorsed by the PDCO in April 2020. 
The Applicant substantiated the clinical relevance of the effect on cataplexy in type I narcolepsy patients, 
as measured by the qualitative Ullanlinna narcolepsy scale score and discussed the discrepancy between 
the paediatric and adult studies. 
First, Lehert 2022 provided evidence that the UNS can be considered as a reliable and sensitive multi-
symptom measurement tool with a minimal important difference (MID) of 3.3 for the UNS total score. 
In  addition,  authors  established  that  the  UNS-CTP  sub-score  allows  the  accurate  and  sensitive 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/180217/2023  
Page 45/70 
 
 
 
measurement of cataplexy alone. Regarding that sub-score, they identified an MID of 1.5. In study P11-
06, the analysis of the UNS-CTP sub-score between group comparison in type 1 narcolepsy patients from 
the FAS, showed a significant LS means difference (SE) [95% CI] between treatment groups (pitolisant 
minus  placebo)  of  -1.77  (0.78)  [-3.29;  -0.24],  p=0.0229.  (P11-06  CSR  Table  32)  which  reached  the 
MID of 1.5 established by Lehert 2022. 
Second, regarding the discrepancy on the cataplexy rate between the paediatric and adult studies, the 
Applicant provided overall acceptable arguments i.e.:  
1) the inclusion criteria are not identical between the paediatric and adult studies (only NT1 for 
adult  studies  and  NT1  /  NT2  for  paediatric  study)  with  a  more  stringent  and  higher  rate  of 
cataplexy for inclusion in adult studies, and on the opposite a potential underestimation of the 
count of cataplexy episodes in the paediatric study  
2) the adults’ study P11-05 (the HARMONY CTP study) was sized and powered based on the WRC 
as the primary endpoint whereas in the paediatric study P11-06, it was sized and powered based 
on the UNS total score with WRC as a secondary endpoint,  
3) although results on the WRC in the NT1 paediatric population remain in favour of pitolisant 
(rate Ratio of 0.42 [95% CI: 0.18 to 1.01], p=0.0540) it was close to significance,  
4) a simple comparison of point estimate rate Ratio and 95%confidence interval results in adult 
studies of rR=0.52 [95%CI: 0.37 to 0.74] with results in the paediatric population of rR=0.42 
[95% CI: 0.18 to 1.01] p=0.0540, did not show a difference between these two populations,  
5) an initially post-hoc analysis performed on the most severe patients (WRC > 15) showed a 
similar decrease of the proportion of severe patients between pitolisant and placebo groups, for 
both adults and paediatrics (in adults, a reduction in the proportion of patients with a WRC >15, 
between baseline and the end of the study of 6.7% in pitolisant group vs 25.0% in placebo group 
and in paediatrics, a reduction in the proportion of patients with a WRC >15 , between baseline 
and the end of the study of 5.6% in pitolisant group vs 23.5% in placebo group). 
Third, considering the relevance of the Ullanlinna narcolepsy scale in paediatric patients and especially 
its cataplexy subscore, whose positive result was not confirmed by the result on the secondary endpoint 
WRC,  the  Applicant  justified  that  the  UNS  was  developed  by  Hublin  1994,  as  a  highly  specific  and 
sensitive qualitative and quantitative tool for assessing narcoleptic symptoms in comparison to the WRC, 
considered as only a quantitative tool for cataplexy episodes. The data based on the reference by Hublin 
1994 have already been partially discussed previously and are considered acceptable. 
The Applicant performed post-hoc subgroups’ analyses to discuss the favourable effects of the primary 
endpoint (UNS) and the first key secondary endpoint (PDSS) in type I and II narcolepsy subgroups. 
The CHMP agreed with the Applicant's interpretation from the descriptive post-hoc analyses. Indeed, in 
the overall population, the mean differences from baseline to the end of treatment for UNS and PDSS 
total scores were numerically greater and statistically significant in the pitolisant group (N=70) compared 
to the placebo group (N=37): for UNS scale -3. 90 (7.69), CI95%: -7.00, -0.80 and for PDSS scale -3. 
45 (5.74), CI95%: -5.76, -1.14. These above described post-hoc results confirm the result of treatment 
effect  observed  in  the  FAS  population  previously  assessed,  in  favour  of  the  pitolisant  group,  in  the 
primary analysis for UNS scale, -3. 69 (1.37), CI95%: -6.38, -0.99, p=0.0073, and -3. 41 (1.07) and 
for PDSS scale CI95%: -5.52, -1.31, p=0.0015. 
Despite the lack of information of the precise statistical method used to estimate the CI95% related to 
the descriptive analyses on UNS and PDSS scores by type of Narcolepsy, the mean difference of UNS 
total score change from baseline to the end of treatment for the pitolisant group vs placebo group was 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/180217/2023  
Page 46/70 
 
 
 
much lower and not statistically significant for type I narcolepsy (NT1) subgroup (N=88) -2.49 (7.24), 
CI95%: -5.78, 0.80 but significant statistically for type II narcolepsy (NT2) subgroup (N=19) -11. 04 
(8.72), CI95%: -19.50, -2.59. Indeed, the small effect of pitolisant of --2.49 (7.24) for NT1 subgroup 
compared to -11.04 (8.72) for the NT2 subgroup may be explained as follows: The NT2 subgroup is very 
small  (N=19)  therefore  the  treatment  effect  based  on  a  mean  difference,  is  very  sensitive  to  a  few 
pitolisant patients very responders with extreme values of the UNS change from baseline (median (q1-
q3):-5.25  (-31.50,-3.50)).  However,  the  NT1  subgroup  is  four  times  larger  (N=88)  than  the  NT2 
subgroup,  therefore,  the  mean  difference  is  less  sensitive  to  a  few  patients  treated  by  pitolisant  with 
extreme values of the UNS change from baseline (median (q1-q3):-3.75 (-32.50,11.0)). 
The PDSS total score results were comparable to the UNS total score but were statistically significant in 
the two subgroups, for NT1 subgroup, the mean difference was -2.45 (5.05), CI95%:-4.75, -0.15, and 
for NT2 subgroup of -8.94 (7.56), CI95%: -16.28, -1.61. The statistically significant treatment effect for 
both NT1 and NT2 subgroups for the PDSS total score shows that pitolisant is effective in both kinds of 
narcolepsy. 
The Applicant provided new sensitivity analyses to ensure the lack of interaction between the type of 
narcolepsy and the treatment effect, measured by UNS total and PDSS scales. For this analysis, random 
meta-analytical model has been applied and the simple model was selected according to the Bayesian 
Information criterion (BIC). No significant heterogeneity of the treatment effect between NT1 and NT2 
subgroups has been identified for UNS total score (I2=55%, χ2 test, p=0.136) and for PDSS total score 
(I2=45%,  χ2  test,  p=0.178).  In  agreement  with  the  Applicant’s  response,  these  results  support  the 
effect of pitolisant vs placebo without significant heterogeneity across NT1 and NT2 subgroups. 
In  the  complementary  analysis,  related  to  descriptive  post-hoc  analyses  based  on  the  severity  of  the 
disease  (mild,  moderate  and  severe)  based  on  CGI-S  at  baseline,  for UNS  total  and  for PDSS  scales, 
there is a benefit in favour of pitolisant for each severity subgroups which is not statistically significant. 
It could be related to a lack of power, due to small size of the subgroups.  
As with the analysis by type of narcolepsy, the Applicant provided new sensitivity analyses to ensure the 
lack of interaction between the severity of the disease and the treatment effect, measured by UNS total 
and PDSS scales. For this analysis, random meta-analytical model has been applied and the simple model 
was  selected  according  to  the  Bayesian  Information  criterion  (BIC).  No  significant  heterogeneity  has 
been identified between the treatment effect of pitolisant and the severity of the disease for UNS scale 
and PDSS scale. 
The  Applicant  provided  an  overview  of  the  interactions  between  pitolisant  and  current  concomitant 
treatments  of  narcolepsy  (methylphenidate,  modafinil,  solriamfetol,  sodium  oxybate,  dexamfetamine 
and venlafaxine) in the adult population by WHO preferred term, with no/low /medium risk of interaction. 
The Applicant considered that these interactions could be extrapolated to the paediatric population i.e. 
children  and  adolescents  which  is  agreed  as  there  is  no  metabolic  immaturity  for  involved  metabolic 
pathways. 
Overall, the anticipated medium risk of DDI between venlafaxine and pitolisant is already described in 
the  current  SmPC  for  Wakix®  as  follows:  “CYP2D6  inhibitors:  Co-administration  of  pitolisant  with 
paroxetine significantly increases pitolisant mean C max and AUC0—72h ratio about 47% and 105%, 
respectively. Given the 2-fold increase of pitolisant exposure, its coadministration with CYP2D6 inhibitors 
(e.g.  paroxetine,  fluoxetine,  venlafaxine,  duloxetine,  bupropion,  quinidine,  terbinafine,  cinacalcet) 
should  be  done  with  caution.  A  dosage  adjustment  during  the  combination  could  eventually  be 
considered”.

2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The UNS total score at the end of the double blind period in the pivotal study shows that the difference 
is statistically significant (p=0.0073) and that pitolisant is superior to placebo for the primary efficacy 
outcome measure. 
The  PDSS  total  score  at  the  end  of  the  double  blind  period  indicates  a  greater  improvement  in  the 
pitolisant group compared with the placebo group which was statistically significant (p=0.0015) showing 
that  pitolisant  is  superior  to  placebo  the  secondary  efficacy  outcome  measure.  The  rate  of  responder 
(i.e. patients with a change from baseline to end of treatment of at least 3 points on the PDSS) is of 
64.3%  [45/70]  in  the  pitolisant  group  vs  40.5%  [15/37]  in  the  placebo  group,  which  is  statistically 
significant. 
In patients with type 1 narcolepsy, the change in UNS-CTP subscore in patients with type 1 narcolepsy 
shows a statistically significant difference in favour of pitolisant at the end of the double blind period (p 
= 0.0229). 
The  difference  between  pitolisant  and  placebo  groups  on  the  WRC  was  not  significant  (p=0.0540),  in 
patients  with  type  1  narcolepsy.  A  complementary,  post-hoc  analysis  was  done  on  the  most  severe 
patients  with  regards  to  WRC.  The  value  of  this  complementary,  post-hoc  analysis  is  only  descriptive 
and does not allow to draw any robust conclusion.  
Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
All  safety  analyses  were  performed  by  actual  treatment  group  in  the  Safety  Set  (i.e.  all  patient  who 
received at least one treatment dose). The Safety Set included 73 patients in the pitolisant group and 
37 patients in the placebo group. The provided data were collected up to the end of the Part 1 Double-
Blind Period of the study (i.e., the 8-week randomized, double-blind period and the 1-week single-blind 
washout period).  
The patient exposure is 73 paediatric patients in the pitolisant group and 37 paediatric patients in the 
placebo group. 
Patients  were  exposed  for  8  weeks  to  study  treatment  (double-blind  period),  and  safety  data  were 
collected until 1 week after treatment discontinuation (washout period). 
Adverse events 
•  Brief Summary of Adverse Events 
All AEs (Adverse Events) were collected from the time the patient gave informed consent until 1 month 
after the last drug administration. A TEAE (Treatment-Emergent Adverse event) corresponded to an AE 
that occurred on or after first dose of treatment up to 7 days post-last dose. 
See below an overview of AEs in the Safety Set:

•  Most Frequently Reported Adverse Events 
The most frequently reported (≥5% of patients by treatment group) TEAEs reported in the Safety Set 
are summarized by SOC and PT in the below table: 
Table 23: Most Frequently Reported (≥5% of Ptients) Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events 
by System Organ Class and preferred Term (Safety Set) 
The  most  frequently  reported  (≥5%  of  patients  overall)  TEAEs  were  headache  (15.5%)  and  insomnia 
(5.5%). 
Overall, 28 events of “headache” were reported in 17 patients (15.5, 17/110): 
-  24 events in 14 patients (19.2%, 14/73) from the pitolisant group 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/180217/2023  
Page 51/70 
 
 
 
 
 
-  4 events in 3 patients (8.1%, 3/37) from the placebo group 
Overall, 6 events of “insomnia” were reported in 6 patients (5.5, 6/110): 
-  5 events in 5 patients (6.8%, 5/73) from the pitolisant group 
-  1 event in 1 patient (2.7%, 1/37) from the placebo group 
Overall, the most frequently reported AEs and TEAEs (corresponding to AEs that occurred on or after 
first dose of treatment up to 7 days post-last dose) were “headache” and “insomnia”. 
This  is  in  line  with  the  known  safety profile  in  the  adult  population:  the  current  SmPC  for  WAKIX 
indicates  that  the  most  frequent  adverse  drug  reactions  (ADRs)  reported  with  pitolisant  in  adult 
patients were “insomnia” (8.4%) and “headache” (7.7%). 
Besides the TEAEs of “headache” and “insomnia”, another TEAE was reported in the pitolisant group: 
2 events of “influenza” were reported in 2 patients. 
No other TEAEs were reported in the pitolisant group. 
•  Categorization of All Adverse Events 
o  Adverse Events by Severity 
The majority of TEAEs were of mild (62/89 events, 69.7%) or moderate (24/89 events, 27.0%) intensity.  
89 TEAEs were reported in 35 patients: 
-  60 TEAEs in 22 patients (30.1%, 22/73) from the pitolisant group 
o  70% of the TEAEs in the pitolisant group were of mild intensity (reported in 27.4% of 
the patients, 20/73) 
o  25% of the TEAEs in the pitolisant group were of moderate intensity (reported in 11.0% 
of the patients, 8/73) 
-  29 TEAEs in 13 patients (35.1%, 13/37) from the placebo group 
o  69% of the TEAEs in the placebo group were of mild intensity (reported in 27.0% of the 
patients, 10/37) 
o  31% of the TEAEs in the placebo group were of moderate intensity (reported in 16.2% 
of the patients, 6/37) 
Three (3) TEAEs of severe intensity (5.0%) were reported by 2 patients (2.7%) in the pitolisant group 
(pyrexia and headache in 1 patient, insomnia in 1 patient). The 2 patients were in the group age ≥12 
years old: 
- 
The  first  case  concerned  a  16-year-old  female  patient  with  medical  history  of  narcolepsy  and 
severe obesity. She experienced severe pyrexia and headache, 19 days after pitolisant initiation. 
The events resolved on the same day with paracetamol. Pitolisant treatment was maintained and 
then the dose was increased, without recurrence of the events. 
- 
The second case involved a 14-year-old female patient with narcolepsy, who presented severe 
insomnia 22 days after pitolisant initiation, with positive dechallenge. 
Of the 2 cases reporting severe TEAEs, only the event of “insomnia” appears to be related to pitolisant 
(positive dechallenge). According to the current SmPC for WAKIX, “insomnia” is the most reported ADR 
in the adult population. This can be explained by the mechanism of action of pitolisant. 
There were no TEAEs of severe intensity reported in the placebo group.

o  Adverse Events by Relationship to Treatment 
47 treatment-related TEAEs were reported in 22 patients: 
-  35 treatment-related TEAEs in 14 patients (19.2%, 14/73) from the pitolisant group 
-  12 treatment-related TEAEs in 8 patients (21.6%, 8/37) from the placebo group 
The  proportion  of  patients  with  at  least  1  treatment-related  TEAE  was  comparable  between  the  two 
groups. 
The most frequently reported treatment-related TEAEs in the pitolisant group were “headache” (11%), 
“insomnia” (5.5%) and “hypertension” (2.7%), respectively.  
According  to  the  current  SmPC  for  WAKIX,  the  most  frequent  ADRs  reported  with  pitolisant  in  adult 
patients were insomnia (8.4%) and headache (7.7%). In the SmPC, the ADR of “hypertension” is listed 
as uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100) in the adult population. 
Data on treatment-related TEAEs are reassuring.  
o  Adverse Events by Outcome 
There was 1 TEAE in 1 patient in the pitolisant group that was not resolved (pruritis of moderate intensity, 
not related to study treatment). All other TEAEs were resolved (88/89 events, 98.9%). 
o  Adverse Events During the Stable Dose Period (V5 to V7) 
30 TEAEs were reported in 14 patients in the stable dose period: 
-  15 TEAEs in 6 patients (8.2%, 6/73) from the pitolisant group 
-  15 TEAEs in 8 patients (21.6%, 8/37) from the placebo group 
The most frequently reported TEAEs in the stable dose period (more than in 1 patient from the safety 
set) were: 
-  Headache 
o  3 events in 2 patients (2.7%, 2/73) from the pitolisant group 
o  3 events in 3 patients (8.1%, 3/37) from the placebo group 
-  Cataplexy 
o  1 event in 1 patient (1.4%, 1/73) from the pitolisant group 
o  1 event in 1 patient (2.7%, 1/37) from the placebo group 
-  Somnolence 
o  2 events in 1 patient (1.4%, 1/73) from the pitolisant group 
o  1 event in 1 patient (2.7%, 1/37) from the placebo group 
- 
Influenza 
o  2 events in 1 patient (1.4%, 1/73) from the pitolisant group 
o  1 event in 1 patient (2.7%, 1/37) from the placebo group 
-  Upper respiratory tract infection: 
o  No event from the pitolisant group 
o  3 events in 2 patients (5.4%, 2/37) from the placebo group 
All other TEAEs recorded in the stable dose period were each reported by 1 patient overall. 
In  the  pitolisant  group,  the  proportion  of  patients  reporting  TEAEs  during  the  stable  dose  period  was 
comparable in patients receiving daily 40 mg, 20 mg or 10 mg doses:

-  40 mg dose (n=42): 7 TEAEs were reported by 4 patients (9.5%); 
-  20 mg dose (n=17): 3 TEAEs were reported by 2 patients (11.8%); 
-  10 mg dose (n=11): 5 TEAEs were reported by 1 patient (9.1%). 
The proportion of patients with at least 1 TEAE in the stable dose period was lower in the pitolisant 
group. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
There were no TEAEs leading to death and no SAEs. 
Treatment-emergent AESI in the Safety Set are summarized by SOC and PT in the table below: 
Table 24: Treatment-Emergent Aadverse Events of Special Interest by System Organ Class 
and Preferred Term (Safety Set) 
Overall,  9  patients  (8.2%)  reported  9  treatment-emergent  AESI.  The  proportion  of  patients  with 
treatment-emergent AESI was higher in the pitolisant group (7 patients [9.6%], 7 events) than in the 
placebo group (2 patients [5.4%], 2 events). 
The most frequently reported AESI was insomnia, with 6 events reported in 6 patients (5.5%) overall. 
The proportion of patients with insomnia was higher in the pitolisant group (5 patients [6.8%], 5 events) 
than in the placebo group (1 patient [2.7%], 1 event). Only 1 event of insomnia was reported during 
the  stable  dosing  period.  The  intensity  of  insomnia  was  severe  for  1  patient  (the  patient  was  in  the 
pitolisant group and the event was considered to be related to treatment), moderate for 2 patients, and 
mild for 3 patients. Insomnia was considered to be related to treatment for 4 events in the pitolisant 
group and for the event in the placebo group. 
Anxiety was reported by 1 patient (1.4%) in the pitolisant group and 1 patient (2.7%) in the placebo 
group. These events were not reported during the stable dose period, were of mild intensity, and were 
considered to be related to study treatment. 
Dyspepsia was reported by 1 patient (1.4%) in the pitolisant group. This event was not reported during 
the stable dose period, was of mild intensity, and was not considered to be related to study treatment. 
The proportion of patients with an AESI was higher in the pitolisant group. However, all reported AESIs 
are known frequent ADRs in the adult population (listed in the current SmPC for WAKIX).

Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
Haematology results were normal for the majority of the patients. However, 1 patient in the pitolisant 
group presented a value of 102.0 g/L for hemoglobin at V7 (reported AE: “iron deficiency anaemia”, mild 
intensity, not recovered), not considered related to study treatment.  
Blood chemistry 
There were no abnormal, clinically significant blood chemistry values. 
Urinalysis 
Urinalysis results were normal for the majority of the patients (expect for 1 patient in the placebo group, 
and the events recovered). 
Urine test of drug abuse 
Tests of drug abuse were all negative. 
Serum pregnancy test 
Pregnancy tests were all negative. 
No abnormal laboratory values were considered to be related to treatment study. 
•  Other observations related to safety 
o  Vital Signs 
There were no notable changes in SBP, DBP, HR, or BMI during the study. 
Hypertension  of  mild  intensity,  considered  to  be  related  to  study  treatment  and  noted  as  ‘recovered 
without  sequelae’  for  both  patients,  was  reported  as  a  TEAE  in  2  patients  in  the  pitolisant  group. 
Hypertension was described in 1 female patient aged 17 years, in the BMI class overweight and height 
of 163 cm (corresponding to normal arterial pressure [SBP-DBP] <120-79 mmHg); she presented for 1 
day, between V3 and V4 (at 10 mg daily) a slight increase of SBP (SBP-DBP, 122-78 mmHg), while at 
baseline  her  SBP  was  already  abnormal  (SBP-DBP,  122-68  mmHg).  She  normalized  blood  pressure 
without treatment during all following visits of study (except at V5, where SBP was 120 mmHg, below 
the baseline value). Another case of hypertension was reported in 1 male patient aged 16 years, in the 
BMI  class  normal  range  and  height  of  183  cm  (corresponding  to  normal  arterial  pressure  [SBP-DBP] 
<129-82  mmHg);  he  presented  after  6  days  of  placebo  treatment,  between  V7  and  V8,  arterial 
hypertension at SBP-DBP, 145-90 mmHg, improving 3 days later, at V8 with SBP-DBP, 131-86 mmHg. 
There was no anti-hypertensive medication prescribed but diet. To be noted, at baseline, his SBP was 
just above normal value for sex and height (SBP-DBP, 129-79 mmHg).  
o  Electrocardiograms 
There were no notable changes in the ECG results during the study and all except 1 evaluable ECG which 
was was interpreted as abnormal, clinically significant in 1 patient in the pitolisant group at V5; the HR 
was decreased from 87 bpm at V1 to 59 bpm at V5 and there was no concomitant medication intake. 
There were no patients with a QTcF post-dose >450 msec, a difference in QTcF post-dose versus pre-
dose ≥60 msec, or QT post-dose ≥500 msec during the study.

o  Childhood Depression Inventory (CDI) 
The  CDI  scale  is  a  27-item  self-administrated  questionnaire  commonly  used  in  research  to  assess 
depression. The short version of 12 items was used in the study. The patient was asked to pick out the 
statement in each of the items which best described the way he/she felt right now at the moment of the 
assessment. The range of scores for the scale are 0-3=none or minimal; 4-7=mild; 8-15=moderate; ≥
16=severe depression. 
The mean (SD) CDI total score decreased during the double-blind period of the study for patients overall 
and in each treatment group: 
- 
- 
- 
The mean (SD) CDI total score for all patients was 4.2 (3.3) at baseline and 3.6 (3.0) at V6; 
The mean (SD) CDI total score for patients in the pitolisant group was 4.4 (3.5) at baseline and 3.6 
(3.2) at V6; 
The mean (SD) CDI total score for patients in the placebo group was 3.8 (3.0) at baseline and 3.5 
(2.8) at V6. 
The mean (SD) CDI total score at V8 after the 1-week washout period was decreased from baseline for 
patients in both the pitolisant group (4.0 [3.7]) and the placebo group (3.1 [2.7]). 
The CDI range of scores is presented for the Safety Set in the below table: 
Table 25: Childhood Depression Inventory – Range of Final Score (Safety Set) 
The  percentage  of  patients  reporting  none  or  minimal  depression  increased  from  baseline  during  the 
study: 
- 
Patients overall: 45.5% of patients at baseline and 56.1% of patients at V6; 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/180217/2023  
Page 56/70 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
Pitolisant group: 46.6% of patients at baseline and 57.7% of patients at V6; 
Placebo group: 43.2% of patients at baseline and 52.8% of patients at V6. 
The percentage of patients reporting none or minimal depression at V8 after the 1-week washout period 
was  increased  from  baseline  for  patients  in  both  the  pitolisant  group  (56.5%)  and  the  placebo  group 
(61.1%). 
The percentage of patients reporting mild depression was decreased from baseline during the study: 
- 
- 
- 
Patients overall: 37.3% of patients at baseline and 32.7% of patients at V6; 
Pitolisant group: 32.9% of patients at baseline and 28.2% of patients at V6; 
Placebo group: 45.9% of patients at baseline and 41.7% of patients at V6. 
The  percentage  of  patients  reporting  mild  depression  at  V8  after  the  1-week  washout  period  was 
decreased  from  baseline  for  patients  in  both  the  pitolisant  group  (21.7%)  and  the  placebo  group 
(33.3%). 
Moderate depression at baseline was reported by a higher proportion of patients in the pitolisant group 
(20.5%)  than  in  the  placebo  group  (10.8%).  At  V6,  the  proportion  of  patients  reporting  moderate 
depression  was  decreased  from  baseline  in  both  the  pitolisant  group  (14.1%)  and  the  placebo  group 
(5.6%).  The  percentage  of  patients  reporting  moderate  depression  at  V8  after  the  1-week  washout 
period was similar to baseline for patients in the pitolisant group (21.7%) and decreased from baseline 
in the placebo group (5.6%). 
There were no patients with severe depression according to the CDI.  
o  Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale 
The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) was evaluated at all visits of the study and used 
by  individuals  who  have  received  training.  Ultimately,  the  determination  of  the  presence  of  suicidal 
ideation or behavior depends on the judgment of the individual administering the scale. The C-SSRS was 
described, in terms of Suicidal risk (Yes/No), at baseline and at each post-baseline visit. 
All  except  3  patients  were  determined  not  to  have  engaged  in  any  suicidal  behavior  and/or  ideation 
during the study. Three (3) patients (1 patient in the pitolisant group, 2 patients in the placebo group) 
were considered to be at suicide risk during the study: 1 patient in the placebo group at V3, 1 patient in 
the pitolisant group at V7, and 1 patient in the placebo group at V7. These patients all declared no suicide 
risk at the following study visits, without anti-depressant treatment. 
o  Withdrawal Symptoms Questionnaire (DSM IV) 
The amphetamine-like withdrawal symptoms questionnaire was used during a placebo wash-out week 
after the abrupt interruption of study drug intake at the end of the double-blind treatment period, on 
two occasions: 3 days after the interruption by phone (T1) and 7 days after the interruption during the 
last visit (V8). 
According to the DSM IV, an amphetamine-like withdrawal syndrome is confirmed if during the first days 
following the abrupt discontinuation of study treatment dysphoria appears accompanied by at least two 
symptoms  among  fatigue,  increased  appetite,  insomnia  or  hypersomnia,  psychomotor  retardation  or 
agitation, and vivid and unpleasant dreams. 
At both T1 (3 days after the interruption) and V8 (7 days after the interruption), the proportion of 
patients reporting each withdrawal symptom was higher in the pitolisant group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/180217/2023  
Page 57/70 
 
 
 
However, the proportion was similar: 
- 
- 
- 
For “dysphoria” at T1 (11.5% in the pitolisant group; 9.4% in the placebo group) 
For “psychomotor retardation or agitation” at T1 (8.2% in the pitolisant group; 6.3% in the 
placebo group) 
For “fatigue” at V8 (30.0% in the pitolisant group; 27.8% in the placebo group) 
In the pitolisant group, the most frequently reported withdrawal symptoms were: “insomnia or 
hypersomnia” (27.9% at T1 and 30.0% at V8) and “fatigue” (26.2% at T1 and 30.0% at V8). 
The proportion of patients who met the definition of amphetamine-like withdrawal syndrome was 
higher in the pitolisant group at T1 and V8: 
- 
- 
Pitolisant group: 9.6% at T1 and 16.4% at V8 
Placebo group: 5.4% at T1 and 8.1% at V8 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
There were no discontinuations due to AEs.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The patient exposure in study P11-06 is 73 paediatric patients in the pitolisant group and 37 paediatric 
patients  in  the  placebo  group.  Patients  were  exposed  for  8  weeks  to  study  treatment  (double-blind 
period), and safety data were collected until 1 week after treatment discontinuation (washout period). 
Between baseline and after the 1-week washout period, the proportion of patients from the pitolisant 
group in the range “none or minimal depression” increased. The proportion of patients in the range “mild 
depression” decreased, and remained similar in the range “moderate depression”. Detailed analysis of 
comorbidity depression was provided and showed that overall throughout the study, the CDI score for 
patients  in  both  group  (pitolisant  and  placebo)  decreased  However  globally,  the  mean  CDI  score  was 
higher in the pitolisant group, but remained in the range “none or minimal” or “mild”. 
Regarding the assessment of withdrawal symptoms, the proportion of patients reporting each withdrawal 
symptom  was  higher  in  the  pitolisant  group  than  in  the  placebo  group,  both  3  days  and  7  days  after 
pitolisant  discontinuation.  In  the  pitolisant  group,  the  most  frequently  reported  withdrawal  symptoms 
were:  “insomnia  or  hypersomnia”  and  “fatigue”.  The  proportion  of  patients  who  met  the  definition  of 
amphetamine-like withdrawal syndrome was higher in the pitolisant group than in the placebo group, 
both  3  days  and  7  days  after  pitolisant  discontinuation.  Pitolisant  may  induce  withdrawal  syndrome; 
however the difference in the proportion of patients with amphetamine-like withdrawal syndrome was 
not significant (Chi-2 test, p=0.229). 
No new safety concern emerged from the paediatric population in the P11-06 study. The safety profile 
for pitolisant seems similar between the adult and paediatric populations. There were no deaths, no SAEs 
and  no  patient  discontinued  the  treatment  due  to  AEs.  The  most  frequently  reported  AEs  were 
“headache” and “insomnia” (respectively in 11% and 5.5% of the patient in the pitolisant group). This 
is in line with the known safety profile in the adult population. 
Regarding  the  severity  of  AEs,  the  proportion  of  AEs  of  mild  or  moderate  intensity  was  comparable 
between the pitolisant group and the placebo group. Of the 2 cases reporting severe AEs, both in the 
pitolisant group (events of pyrexia and headache in 1 patient, and event of insomnia in another patient), 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/180217/2023  
Page 58/70 
 
 
 
 
 
only the event of “insomnia” appears to be related to pitolisant (positive dechallenge). This is consistent 
with the mechanism of action of the substance. 
No abnormal laboratory values were considered to be related to treatment study. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
This  assessment  of  safety  has  not  identified  new  risks  in  children/adolescents  regarding  the  use  of 
pitolisant. In the P11-06 study, the safety profile in paediatric population appears to be comparable to 
the safety profile in adult population. 
The  present  type  II  variation  lacks  robust  safety  information  on  long-term  follow-up  although  some 
interim long-term safety data (up to 72 months) from the open-label extension study currently ongoing 
in paediatric patients have been provided over the course of the assessment. 
 “Long-term safety” is already a missing information in the RMP and PSURs and will be also applicable 
to paediatric population. The RMP was updated accordingly.  
2.4.6.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.  
2.5.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version with this application.  
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 7.1 is acceptable.  
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes.

do not require user consultation with target patient groups. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Narcolepsy is a rare, chronic neurological disorder, frequently occurring from childhood and persisting 
through adolescence and adulthood. The prevalence of narcolepsy in childhood is not known but can be 
estimated from adult studies to be greater than 0.02% to 0.06% in Western countries. Initial symptoms 
of narcolepsy occur before the age of 18 in over 50% of patients and may start at a very young age also 
before puberty onset, often with similar but stronger symptoms than in adults.  
The  diagnosis  criteria  have  been  defined  in  the  revised  International  Classification  of  Sleep  Disorders 
(ICSD- 3, AASM 2014) and separate the narcolepsy with cataplexy (Type 1) and the narcolepsy without 
cataplexy (Type 2). 
The presentation of narcolepsy can be very variable, making the diagnosis difficult. Narcolepsy is a long-
term sleep disorder which affects the brain’s ability to regulate the normal sleep-wake cycle. This leads 
to symptoms such as an irresistible urge to sleep, even at inappropriate times and places, and disturbed 
night-time  sleep.  Some  patients  also  have  episodes  of  severe  muscle  weakness  (cataplexy)  that  can 
cause  collapse.  Narcolepsy  occurs  during  childhood  in  combination  with  cataplexy  in  two-thirds  of 
patients. Symptoms may develop rapidly over a few weeks or months, with excessive daytime sleepiness 
(EDS) and cataplexy being the most dramatic and observable symptoms.  
Paediatric  narcolepsy  is  also  associated  with  comorbidities  including  rapid  weight  gain,  precocious 
puberty, and ADHD (recently published systematic review of the literature showed that more than 30% 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/180217/2023  
Page 64/70 
 
 
 
of  children  with  narcolepsy  presented  symptoms  of  ADHD  [Kim  et  al.  2020]),  and  increased  risk  for 
deficits in social functioning, depression, and anxiety. School performance is also typically impaired.  
Therefore,  the  burden  of  this  disorder  in  children  is  higher  than  in  adults.  Consequently,  an  early 
diagnosis with appropriate treatment, is fundamental to allow children or adolescents with narcolepsy to 
potentially reach a normal school performance and to reduce social impairment. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
According to guidelines published by the European task force, management of narcolepsy with or without 
cataplexy relies on several classes of  drugs, namely stimulants (amphetamine and non-amphetamine 
like methylphenidate) for EDS, wake-promoting agents such as modafinil, histamine receptor antagonists 
such  as  pitolisant  in  adults,  antidepressants  for  cataplexy,  and  hypno-sedative  drugs  for  disturbed 
nocturnal sleep. However, the use of some of these treatments may be limited due to off-label use or 
by  associated  adverse  effects  and  because  the  dosing  regimen  may  require  a  nocturnal  intake  for 
children. 
Cataplexy  may  be  managed  off  label  with  serotonin  reuptake  inhibitors  (fluoxetine),  tricyclic 
antidepressants (clomipramine), or selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (venlafaxine). Cataplexy 
can also be managed with sodium oxybate in paediatrics > 7 years of age. However sodium oxybate has 
high  potential  for  abuse  and  respiratory  depression  and  sedation  that  require  careful  oversight,  in 
particular in paediatrics. Considering the current unmet medical need in the management of narcolepsy 
in  paediatric  population,  combination  therapies  including  pitolisant  could  be  an  interesting  option  for 
treatment of EDS with or without cataplexy to expand the treatment panel options, all the more that 
pitolisant showed absence or low abuse potential according to clinical data. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
P11-06  Study,  a  double-blind,  multicentre,  placebo-controlled,  randomised-withdrawal  design  study 
provided some insights into the magnitude of effect of pitolisant that could be seen in children from 6 to 
less  than  18  years  with  narcolepsy  with/without  cataplexy.  The  study  comprised  a  28-day  screening 
period that included a 2-week baseline period, an 8-week double blind period and a 1-week single blind 
washout  period  and  a  currently  ongoing  prolonged  open-label  period  with  pitolisant  treatment  for 
patients willing to continue in the study. 
A total of 110 patients were enrolled and randomized in the study: 72 patients in the pitolisant group 
and 38 patients in the placebo group and three patients withdrew consent and discontinued from the 
study (2 patients in the pitolisant group and 1 patient in the placebo group). The majority of patients 
(90 patients [81.8%]) had type 1 narcolepsy and 20 patients (18.2%) had type 2 narcolepsy reflecting 
the current epidemiology in paediatrics. Two thirds of the patients in the study were over 12 year of age. 
Most patients received a daily dose of 20 mg (23.9%) or 40 mg (59.2%) whatever the age group. As 
recommended, no patient weighing ˂40 kg received a dose > 20 mg daily. For patients weighing ≥ 40 
kg, the majority received a daily dose of 40 mg (72.4%). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Regarding the primary endpoint, for the overall population, change from baseline to end of treatment in 
UNS total score was - 6.36 (8.59) in the pitolisant group (N=70) and -2.46 (5.55) in the placebo group 
(N=37), indicating a greater improvement in the pitolisant group compared with the placebo group. The 
UNS total score at the end of the double blind period, measured by the difference in LS means between 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/180217/2023  
Page 65/70 
 
 
 
pitolisant and placebo (-3.69 (1.37) [-6.38; -0.99]) shows that the difference is statistically significant 
(p=0.0073) and that pitolisant is superior to placebo for the primary efficacy outcome measure. 
Further analyses were conducted for the PPS and the difference in LS means between treatment groups 
(pitolisant minus placebo) was -4.01 (1.52) [-7.03; -0.98], p=0.0100. The primary analysis results were 
supported by the results of all the sensitivity analyses of the UNS total score between group comparisons 
in the FAS (MNAR imputation [p = 0.0079], MAR imputation with centre as fixed effect [p = 0.0079], 
MAR  imputation  with  interaction  treatment-by-oxybate  sodium  intake  [p  =  0.0023],  main  model  in 
patients without oxybate sodium intake [p = 0.0023], observed cases (i.e., completers) [p = 0.0071], 
and MAR imputation – actual treatment group [p = 0.0148]). 
Regarding the secondary endpoints: 
-  PDSS: The mean (SD) change from baseline to end of treatment in PDSS total score was -5.54 
(5.31) in the pitolisant group (N=70) and -2.09 (6.47) in the placebo group (N=37), indicating 
a greater improvement in the pitolisant group compared with the placebo group. After analysis, 
the  PDSS  total  score  at  the  end  of  the  double  blind  period,  measured  by  the  difference  in  LS 
means between pitolisant and placebo (-3.41 (1.07) [-5.52; -1.31]) shows that the difference is 
statistically significant (p=0.0015) and that pitolisant is superior to placebo for the daytime 
sleepiness associated with narcolepsy. The rate of responder (i.e. patients with a change from 
baseline to end of treatment of at least 3 points on the PDSS) is of 64.3% [45/70] in the pitolisant 
group vs 40.5% [15/37] in the placebo group, which is statistically significant. Similar results 
were observed in the PPS with a statistically significant difference in favour of pitolisant after an 
8-week treatment period on the change in PDSS total score. The main analysis results were also 
supported  by  the  results  of  the  sensitivity  analyses  (MNAR  imputation  [p=0.0021],  observed 
cases (i.e., completers) [p=0.0020] and MAR imputation – actual treatment group [p=0.0031]). 
-  UNS-CTP: In patients with type 1 narcolepsy, the mean (SD) change from baseline to end of 
treatment in UNS CTP subscore was -2.83 (3.96) in the pitolisant group (N=60) and -1.27 (3.17) 
in the placebo group (N=28), indicating a greater improvement in the pitolisant group compared 
with the placebo group. There was a statistically significant difference in favour of pitolisant 
after the 8-week treatment period on the change in UNS CTP subscore in patients with type 1 
narcolepsy (LS means difference (SE) [95% CI]: -1.77 (0.78) [-3.29; -0.24]; p = 0.0229). The 
effect of pitolisant remained significant in the PPS (p = 0.0295) and in the sensitivity analyses 
in the FAS (MNAR imputation [p=0.0277], completers (observed cases) imputation [p=0.0284], 
MAR imputation – actual treatment group [p=0.0301]). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
-  UNS: The switch from the paediatric daytime sleepiness scale to the Ullanlinna narcolepsy scale 
score  required  further  clarification  and  justification,  given  that  the  switch  occurred  when  the 
study  was  nearly  completed  and  reported  outcome  differences.  A  detailed  discussion  was 
requested about the validity, accuracy, applicability, credibility of the Ullanlinna scale score and 
the  comparability  with  PDSS.  A  difference  in  scale  score  corresponding  to  a  minimal  clinically 
important difference was discussed and substantiated.  
-  Cataplexy: For medicines effective in narcolepsy, an effect is seen on both daytime sleepiness 
as well as cataplexy rate. Therefore the Applicant had to substantiate the clinical relevance of 
the effect on cataplexy in type I narcolepsy patients, as measured by the qualitative Ullanlinna 
narcolepsy  scale  score  and  discuss/explain  the  discrepancy  between  the  paediatric  and  adult 
studies.  Indeed,  in  the  paediatric  study,  the  effect  on  the  cataplexy  rate  is  almost  none.  In 
contrast in the adult studies, the cataplexy rate decreased from 9 per week to less than 4 per 
Assessment report

week (Wakix SmPC). Further uncertainty was related to the relevance of cataplexy subscore of 
the Ullanlinna narcolepsy scale in paediatric patients, since the positive result on this subscore 
in the type 1 narcolepsy subgroup was not confirmed by the result on the secondary endpoint 
weekly cataplexy attacks. Indeed, the difference between pitolisant and placebo groups [2.14 
(0.27) in the pitolisant group and 5.05 (0.37) in the placebo group] on the WRC during the last 
week  of  the  treatment  period  in  the  double-blind  phase  (D49  to  D56)  was  not  significant 
(p=0.0540), in patients with type 1 narcolepsy in the FAS. 
-  Statistical aspects: The sponsor performed the subgroup analyses for the primary endpoint. 
In view of the results, the mean UNS change scores are rather consistent in each subgroup (sex, 
age and BMI) with those observed in the main analysis. Sex, age and/or BMI did seemingly have 
no influence on the UNS scores. However the evolution of UNS scores by sex, age and BMI should 
be interpreted with caution because of the low patient numbers in each subgroup and are only 
of descriptive value. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Assessment of safety has not identified new risks in children/adolescents regarding the use of pitolisant. 
In the P11-06 study, from this short term 8 week study the safety profile in paediatric population appears 
to be comparable to the safety profile in adult population. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Limited long-term safety data have been provided in the original submission and uncertainties regarding 
long  term  safety  of  pitolisant  in  paediatric  patients  are  an  issue.  An  open-label  extension  study  is 
currently ongoing in this patient population.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The UNS total score at the end of the double blind period shows that the difference is statistically 
significant (p=0.0073) and that pitolisant is superior to placebo for the primary efficacy outcome 
measure. 
The PDSS total score at the end of the double blind period indicates a greater improvement in the 
pitolisant group compared with the placebo group which was statistically significant (p=0.0015) 
showing that pitolisant is superior to placebo the secondary efficacy outcome measure. The rate of 
responder (i.e. patients with a change from baseline to end of treatment of at least 3 points on the 
PDSS) is of 64.3% [45/70] in the pitolisant group vs 40.5% [15/37] in the placebo group, which is 
statistically significant. 
In patients with type 1 narcolepsy, the change in UNS-CTP subscore in patients with type 1 narcolepsy 
shows a statistically significant difference in favour of pitolisant at the end of the double blind period (p 
= 0.0229). 
The concerns related to the choice and validity of the primary endpoint UNS have been solved and the 
effect of pitolisant on cataplexy in paediatrics have been described.  
Indeed, the switch from the paediatric daytime sleepiness scale to the Ullanlinna narcolepsy scale 
score have been clarified and justified. Moreover a detailed discussion has been provided about the 
validity, accuracy, applicability, credibility of the Ullanlinna scale score and the comparability with 
PDSS. A difference in scale score corresponding to a minimal clinically important difference has also 
been discussed and substantiated as well as the validation of this scale in the paediatric population.

Regarding cataplexy, the Applicant has substantiated the clinical relevance of the effect on cataplexy in 
type I narcolepsy patients, as measured by the qualitative Ullanlinna narcolepsy scale score and 
discussed the discrepancy between the paediatric and adult studies.  
This assessment of safety has not identified new risks in children/adolescents regarding the use of 
pitolisant. At this stage, the safety profile for pitolisant seems comparable between the adult and 
paediatric population. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The overall benefit/risk balance is considered positive in the paediatric population. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Wakix in the paediatric population is considered positive.

1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Requested type II variation 
Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Novartis Europharm Ltd submitted to 
the European Medicines Agency on 9 November 2016 an application for a variation.  
The following changes were proposed:

C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new 
Type II 
I, II, IIIA and

IIIB 
Update of sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC based on safety and efficacy results of the primary analysis from 
the Specific Obligation study A2303 (SOB 004). The Package Leaflet and Labelling are updated accordingly. 
The Annex II and the Risk Management Plan are also proposed to be updated to reflect the potential 
fulfilment the only outstanding specific obligation and the efficacy and safety results of Study A2303, 
respectively. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II, 
Labelling and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
1.2.  Rationale for the proposed change 
The European Commission granted conditional approval to Zykadia on 6 May 2015. Currently, only one of 
the two specific obligations agreed upon at the time of the initial conditional marketing authorisation is still 
outstanding, for which Novartis committed to submitting the final results of a study by September 2018: 
 “In order to further confirm the efficacy of ceritinib in the treatment of patients previously treated with 
crizotinib, the MAH should submit the final results of the phase III efficacy study A2303 comparing ceritinib 
to chemotherapy” (SOB004, due date 30 September 2018). 
With this Type II variation, the MAH provided an update on the results of the progression free survival (PFS) 
from the study A2303 (not the final results of the Study). The MAH, nevertheless, asked the CHMP whether 
the data provided can be considered to fulfil SOB004. 
Annex II and the Risk Management Plan were proposed to be updated to reflect fulfilment of the only 
outstanding specific obligation and the efficacy and safety results of Study A2303, respectively. 
2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
In the EU, Zykadia was granted conditional marketing authorisation on 6 May 2015 for the treatment of adult 
patients with ALK positive advanced NSCLC previously treated with crizotinib, with the original dossier 
supplemented at Day 120 based on data from the Phase II Study A2201 and Study CLDK378A2203 (referred 
to as Study A2203) and updated data from the Phase I Study X2101. 
On July 2016, the MAH submitted the final analysis of the study A2201. Results from this final analysis were 
in line with those previously known from the primary analysis. Both the outcome from primary endpoint and 
values from the secondary endpoints, were maintained.  
The MAH has now submitted a clinical study report from study A2303, which could fulfil the remaining 
Specific Obligation in Annex II. 
Assessment report  
EMA/367341/2017 
Page 3/94 
 
  
  
 
Study A2303 is a Phase III, global, randomized, open-label study of oral ceritinib (750 mg qd fasted) versus 
standard chemotherapy (pemetrexed/docetaxel) in adult patients with ALK positive NSCLC previously 
treated with chemotherapy and crizotinib. 
The inclusion/exclusion criteria allowed the recruitment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic 
ALK-positive NSCLC, previously treated with crizotinib and one or two chemotherapy lines for advanced 
disease (including a platinum-based doublet). 
In terms of primary endpoint (PFS by BIRC), the use of ceritinib is associated to a longer PFS, with a HR of 
0.49 (95% CI 0.36, 0.67). The almost 4 months in the delay of tumour progression or death is considered 
clinically meaningful. Results for OS are not conclusive, with no differences between groups (HR 1.00 95%CI 
0.67, 1.49). Objective Response Rate (ORR) was higher for those patients treated with ceritinib, with almost 
40% of responders vs 7% in the chemotherapy arm. 
Overall, the results from this phase III confirmatory trial are in line with those obtained from previous 
studies. ORR seems similar to response rate seen in the study A2201 (35.7%) and the median PFS by BIRC 
was 7.1 months in the A2201 trial and 5.4 months according to investigator’s assessment. 
From an efficacy perspective, data from the phase III study A2303, show a clinically meaningful result, both 
in terms of PFS and ORR. 
OS data were immature at the time of the primary PFS analysis. With an event rate of 42% and 43% for 
ceritinib and chemotherapy arm respectively, no conclusive results in terms of OS were observed (HR 1.00 
95% CI 0.67, 1.49). The high cross-over rate (65% of patients had crossed over to ceritinib arm along with 
the subsequent therapy with ALK inhibitors) likely impacted study results, however a sensitivity analysis 
carried out as an attempt to correct for crossover, showed similar results (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.65, 1.45). The 
second OS interim analysis will not be available until the end of 2018 and final OS analysis is expected 
around May 2021. However, final OS data are not expected to modify the benefit/risk balance, given the 
likely absence of relevant findings in survival due to the high rate of crossover. For this reason, the final CSR 
is only requested as a recommendation for information and completeness.  
The safety profile of ceritinib in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC characterised in study A2303 seems 
consistent with the known safety of ceritinib in this patient population. The adverse events (AEs) are 
manageable and reversible within the clinical setting with dose reduction/interruption and/or use of 
concomitant medication; only very few patients discontinued study treatment due to ceritinib associated 
AEs. No new safety signals or concerns have been identified in Study A2303 except one new ADR (weight 
decreased) and one additional term for the already existing ADR of liver laboratory test abnormalities was 
identified (i.e, GGT and ALP increased). In support of this risk assessment of ceritinib, the evaluation of the 
information received from the MAH global pharmacovigilance safety database until 10 August 2016 in 22 
ongoing studies did not reveal any new safety concern or a change in frequency or severity of AEs, and does 
not suggest an update to the characterisation of the risks is needed. No new information has emerged based 
on post-marketing usage of ceritinib that would substantially alter the known safety profile. In conclusion, 
the safety data is consistent with the known safety profile of ceritinib. No untoward effects have been 
reported in ongoing trials and pharmacovigilance activities that would alter the established safety profile of 
ceritinib. Routine pharmacovigilance activities, including regular targeted follow-up, should continue to be 
performed. 
In summary, results from the phase III study A2303, have shown a clinically meaningful result both in PFS 
and ORR. These results are in line with data from the previous studies which were the basis of the conditional 
MA and appear sufficient so as to positively conclude about the benefit/risk of ceritinib.  
The MAH´s request to switch from a CMA to a full marketing authorisation based on the results presented is 
accepted. Since these are primarily PFS and ORR, a recommendation to present the two pending analyses 
for OS is proposed. This is based on the fact that no new safety concerns have been identified and that 
Assessment report  
EMA/367341/2017 
Page 4/94 
 
  
  
results from the phase III trial (including the primary endpoint) are consistent with the efficacy results 
supporting the initial MA and by complementing the previously available data constitute comprehensive data 
for the currently approved indication.  
In conclusion, the SOB004 could be considered fulfilled at this point in time as the primary analysis of the 
phase III study A2303 has been submitted, confirming the positive Benefit/Risk of ceritinib for the treatment 
of adult patients with ALK positive advanced NSCLC previously treated with crizotinib. The clinical data 
package supporting the B/R of ceritinib can now be considered comprehensive even though final results for 
OS data are not yet available (secondary endpoint) and the Conditional marketing authorisation can be 
switched to a full MA.  
The MAH should provide the results of the foreseen second interim analysis and final analysis for the 
secondary endpoint of overall survival which are expected by the end of 2018 (interim analysis) and 2022 
(final OS analysis), respectively.

4.  Scientific discussion 
4.1.  Introduction 
Ceritinib was granted accelerated approval in the USA under the trade name of Zykadia on 29 Apr 2014 for 
the treatment of patients with ALK positive metastatic NSCLC who have progressed or are intolerant to 
crizotinib. In the EU/ European Economic Area, Zykadia was granted conditional marketing authorization on 
6 May 2015 for the treatment of adult patients with ALK positive advanced NSCLC previously treated with 
crizotinib, with the original dossier supplemented at Day 120 based on data from the Phase II Study A2201 
and Study CLDK378A2203 (referred to as Study A2203) and updated data from the Phase I Study X2101. 
These data were also submitted to other countries worldwide. To date, Zykadia has been approved in more 
than 50 countries worldwide. 
This clinical assessment report presents and discusses clinical data from the Phase III, multi-center, 
randomized, open-label, confirmatory Phase III Study CLDK378A2303 (referred to as Study A2303) 
supporting the use of ceritinib (LDK378, Zykadia) for the treatment of patients with anaplastic lymphoma 
kinase (ALK) positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have progressed or are intolerant 
to crizotinib.

• 
Treatments 
In this study, ceritinib was administered orally (fasted), once-daily at a planned dose of 750 mg. This dose 
was selected based on the results from the dose-escalation phase of the ongoing Phase I study X2101 
wherein the maximum tolerated dose and recommended dose for the expansion phase were determined to 
be 750 mg once-daily fasted. This recommended dose 750 mg was used in subsequent Phase II and III 
studies. Pemetrexed and docetaxel was administered to the patient as per label instructions by the 
Investigator’s designated staff. 
Table 1: Dose and treatment schedule 
CYP3A enzymes, thereby increasing the risk of reducing ceritinib drug exposure to sub-therapeutic levels. If 
possible, systemic corticosteroid treatment was not allowed during the study, except for: Topical 
applications (e.g., rash), inhaled sprays (e.g., obstructive airways diseases), eye drops or local injections 
(e.g., intra-articular); Stable doses of corticosteroid therapy such as dexamethasone and prednisone (e.g., 
for tumor associated symptoms) were permitted during the course of the study. The corticosteroid dose was 
stabilized (or decreasing) for at least five days before resuming the next dose of study treatment. 
Concomitant treatment of ceritinib with weak inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4/5 was permitted. Caution was 
advised when ceritinib was co-administered with drugs that are moderate inhibitors or inducers of 
CYP3A4/5. Duration of concomitant treatment was kept as short as possible, or completely avoided

whenever possible. Patients receiving such medications were monitored closely for any potentiation of 
toxicity or decrease of clinical benefit due to any individual concomitant medications, and might require dose 
titration or adjustment. Co-administration of ceritinib with strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4/5 was 
prohibited. 
Concomitant treatment of ceritinib with medications known to be metabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 was 
allowed with caution, except for drugs which have narrow therapeutic index/sensitive substrates for this CYP 
isoform. 
The use of gastric protection agents including antacids, H2-antagonists, and proton pump inhibitors were 
allowed. However proton pump inhibitors were used with caution due to the theoretical effects of long-acting 
pH elevating agents (i.e., prolonged acid suppression) on reducing ceritinib absorption. When the concurrent 
use of a H2-antagonist or an antacid with ceritinib was necessary, the H2 blocker was administered 10 hours 
before or two hours after the ceritinib dose, and the antacid was administered two hours before or two hours 
after the ceritinib dose

Objectives 
Primary objective 
To compare the antitumor activity of ceritinib versus chemotherapy, as measured by PFS determined by a 
BIRC. 
Secondary Objectives 
To compare overall survival (OS) in patients treated with ceritinib versus chemotherapy 
To assess the antitumor activity of ceritinib versus chemotherapy, as measured by overall response rate 
(ORR), duration of response (DOR), disease control rate (DCR), and time to response (TTR) determined by 
BIRC and by Investigators. 
To assess the antitumor activity of ceritinib versus chemotherapy in the brain, as measured by overall 
intracranial response rate (OIRR), intracranial disease control rate (IDCR) and duration of intracranial 
response (DOIR), as determined by BIRC neuro-radiologist  
PFS determined by Investigators. 
To evaluate the safety profile of ceritinib versus chemotherapy. 
To assess the effect of ceritinib versus chemotherapy on Patient reported outcomes (PROs), including 
disease-related symptoms, functioning, and health-related quality of life. 
Pharmacokinetics (PK) of ceritinib 
Exploratory objectives included exposure/response relationships including plasma concentration- QTc, and 
biomarker analysis. Exploratory biomarker analyses were not performed at the time of this CSR, and are 
planned to be performed subsequently and documented in a separate report. 
• 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
The primary endpoint used to evaluate the anti-tumor activity of ceritinib versus chemotherapy was PFS, 
defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first radiologically documented PD per 
BIRC assessment or death due to any cause. 
Assessment report  
EMA/367341/2017 
Page 10/94 
 
  
  
The primary efficacy analysis was performed on the FAS according to the treatment arm and randomization 
strata (WHO performance status: 0 vs. 1-2; presence or absence of brain metastases) to which patients 
were assigned at randomization. 
PFS and tumor response was assessed locally and by BIRC based on (RECIST) 1.1. Patients had to have at 
least one documented measurable lesion at study entry (by local assessment). Tumor evaluation was 
performed at baseline and then every six weeks (two cycles) after randomization during the first 18 months, 
and every nine weeks (three cycles) thereafter and at end of treatment (EOT) for response determination. 
Intracranial efficacy was assessed by an independent central neuro-radiologist (intracranial BIRC) for all 
patients with known baseline brain metastasis using modified RECIST 1.1 (up to five target lesions allowed). 
PFS was censored at the date of the last adequate tumor evaluation before the cut -off date or before the 
start of the new anticancer therapy date, whichever was earlier. Clinical deterioration was not considered as 
a qualifying event for progression. In particular, PFS was censored at the last adequate tumor assessment 
if one of the following occurred: absence of event; the event occurred after a new anticancer therapy is 
given; the event occurred after two or more missing tumor assessments. 
Patients were treated until progression of disease (PD, BIRC assessed), unacceptable toxicity, or other 
discontinuation criteria were met (treatment phase). Patients randomized to chemotherapy (pemetrexed or 
docetaxel) treatment were allowed to cross-over to receive ceritinib treatment after BIRC-confirmed 
RECIST-defined PD (extension phase). 
Table 2: Outcome and event dates for PFS and DOR analyses 
Secondary endpoints 
The key secondary endpoint, OS, was defined as the time from date of randomization to date of death due 
to any cause. If the patient was alive at the date of the analysis cut -off or lost to follow-up, then OS was 
censored at the last contact date prior to data cut-off date. Patients who discontinued study treatment, were 
assessed for survival status every three months; OS follow-up will continue until the final OS analysis (when 
approximately 196 deaths are observed). 
Other secondary endpoints included ORR, duration of response (DOR), DCR, time to response (TTR), OIRR, 
IDCR, DOIR and were evaluated by BIRC and Investigator assessment per RECIST 1.1, PFS by Investigator 
assessment per RECIST 1.1, and patient reported outcomes using the European Organization for Research 
and Treatment of Cancer’s core quality of life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30)/lung cancer specific 
questionnaire (LC13), lung cancer symptom scale (LCSS), and EuroQOL five dimensions index (EQ-5D) 
questionnaires

Sample size 
PFS 
Under the assumption that the median PFS in the control arm was three months, it was expected that 
treatment with ceritinib would result in at least a 40% reduction in the hazard rate (corresponding to an 
increase in the median PFS from three months to five months under the exponential model assumption). 
Assuming that the true hazard ratio was 0.60 (under the alternative hypothesis), a total of 161 progression 
events were required to have 90% power at a one-sided 2.5% level of significance to reject the null 
hypothesis (HR=1) using a log –rank test. Assuming a recruitment period of approximately 17 months, with 
a six-month accrual ramp-up period (where the accrual rate increases as additional sites initiate 
recruitment) followed by a steady accrual period (where the accrual rate stabilizes at a uniform rate of 15 
patients/month after the first six months), along with an assumed 15% dropout rate, approximately 236 
patients were needed to be randomized to the two treatment arms in a 1:1 ratio. Given the above 
assumptions it was estimated that the 161st progression event would occur approximately 21 months from 
the date of when the first patient randomized in the study. 
OS 
With 196 deaths the study had 80% cumulative power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.667 using a log-rank test 
and a 3-look Lan-DeMets group sequential design with O’Brien-Fleming type boundary at one-sided 2.5% 
level of significance. If the median OS in the control arm was 8 months (Hanna et al 2004), a 33.3% 
reduction in hazard rate corresponded to an increase in median OS from 8 months to 12 months under the 
exponential model assumption.

Analysis sets 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) consisted of all patients to whom study treatment had been assigned by 
randomization. According to the intent to treat principle, patients were analyzed according to the treatment 
and strata to which they had been assigned during the randomization procedure. 
The Per-Protocol Set (PPS) consisted of a subset of patients in the FAS who had an adequate tumor 
assessment by Investigator at Baseline, a follow-up tumor assessment by Investigator greater than five 
weeks after starting treatment (unless disease progression assessed by Investigator or death was observed 
before that time), received study drug only from the treatment arm they were randomized to prior to 
cross-over and had no protocol deviations that led to exclusion. 
The Cross-over Analysis set consisted of patients randomized to the chemotherapy arm who crossed over to 
receive at least one dose of ceritinib. This analysis set was used for all safety evaluations collected after

Statistical hypothesis, model, and method of analysis 
The distribution of PFS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The median PFS along with 95% CI 
was presented by treatment arm using the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley 1982. Kaplan-Meier 
estimates with 2-sided 95% CIs at specific time points (including at least 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months) were 
summarized. The CIs were constructed using Greenwood’s formula (Kalbfleisch and Prentice 2002) for the 
standard error of the Kaplan-Meier estimate. The Kaplan-Meier curves were displayed by treatment. 
PFS was tested using the stratified log-rank test (stratified according to randomization stratification factors). 
The statistical basis for a claim of efficacy was the statistical significance (at the 2.5% one-sided level of 
significance) for PFS in favor of the ceritinib arm. A Cox regression model stratified by randomization 
stratification factors was used to estimate the HR of PFS, along with 95% CI based on the Wald test. 
Interim analysis 
No interim analysis was planned for PFS. 
Three analyses were planned for OS: 1) an interim analysis at the projected time of the final analysis for PFS 
(provided PFS is significant); 2) an additional interim analysis when approximately 171 deaths were 
observed; 3) a final analysis for OS when approximately 196 deaths were observed. 
An α-spending function for OS according to Lan-DeMets (O’Brien-Fleming) along with the testing strategy 
outlined below was to be used to maintain the overall type-I error rate (Lan and DeMets 1983). This 
guaranteed the protection of the overall level α=2.5% across the two hypotheses and the repeated testing 
of the OS hypotheses in the interim and the final analyses (Glimm 2010). The trial allowed for the stopping 
of the study for a superior OS result, provided the primary endpoint PFS had already been shown to be 
statistically significant favoring the ceritinib treatment arm. Further, the exact nominal p-values that was 
needed to be observed to declare statistical significance at the time of these analyses for OS depended on 
the number of OS events that had been observed at the time of these analyses and the α for OS already 
spent at the time of earlier analyses. 
If OS was tested alone, independent of the testing strategy for PFS,. At the time of final PFS analyses, both 
PFS and interim OS analysis were performed by the Sponsor's clinical team. All patients continued to be 
followed for OS until the final OS analysis (or earlier if OS reached statistical significance at any of the interim 
analysis).

Recruitment 
This study is being conducted in 99 centers across 20 countries. Betwe en 2-Jul-2013 and 2-Nov- 2015, a 
total of 231 patients with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC were randomized to either ceritinib (n=115) or 
chemotherapy (n=116), stratified by WHO performance status [“0”: n=109 (47.2%); “1-2”: n=122 
(52.8%)] and brain metastases at Screening [“Absence”: n=99 (42.9%); “Presence”: n=132 (57.1%)]. The 
cut-off date for this primary analysis was 26-Jan-2016 when 172 PFS events had been documented by BIRC 
and all randomized patients had completed at least 12 weeks of follow-up or had discontinued earlier. The 
analyses are presented using data locked on 22-Apr-2016. The study is ongoing. 
The median duration of follow-up (from randomization to data cut-off date) for all patients was 16.5 months.

Conduct of the study 
The study protocol was amended four times. 
Amendment 1 (27-Aug-2013). At the time of the release of this amendment, two patients had been 
screened for enrollment and treated. The amendment had been implemented to address the availability of 
new safety data, to amend the eligible study population, and to clarify sections of the protocol where 
additional guidance was required. 
Amendment 2 (20-May-2014). At the time of the release of this amendment, 88 patients had been screened 
for enrollment and 67 patients had been randomized. This amendment was updated to change prior one 
platinum-based doublet to one or two prior chemotherapy regimens (including one platinum-based 
doublet). It was implemented to expand the inclusion criteria to allow for one or two prior regimens of 
cytotoxic chemotherapy (one regimen must include a platinum-based doublet) for the treatment of locally 
advanced or metastatic ALK - positive NSCLC and to allow more than one course of prior crizotinib 
treatment. Additional amendment items include updated safety information and clarification of sections of 
the protocol where additional guidance was required. Also clarified that no particular sequence of prior 
crizotinib and chemotherapy was required for enrollment, and either could comprise the last treatment 
received by the patient. 
Amendment 3 (23-Apr-2015). At the time of the release of this amendment, 257 patients had been screened 
for enrollment and 191 patients had been randomized. Included the following key items: Delete the 
requirement for patients randomized to the chemotherapy arm to wait 31 days before crossing over to the 
ceritinib treatment arm and provided guidance on ceritinib treatment initiation for cross-over patients to 
allow patients to cross-over earlier if eligible. The time window for cross-over to ceritinib treatment arm was 
increased from 56 days to 84 days, to allow for resolution of any AEs to grade ≤ 1 (CTCAE v 4.03). In 
addition, patients who had a WHO performance status above two or a history of interstitial lung disease or 
interstitial pneumonitis was not allowed to cross-over. Remove “start of new anti-cancer therapy” as an 
allowable reason to stop collecting tumor assessments to enable sensitivity analysis of PFS following a pure 
intent -to-treat principle where start of new antineoplastic therapy did not result in censoring for PFS. 
Include an additional condition for the final analysis of PFS, requiring that all randomized patients had to 
complete at least 12 weeks of follow-up or had discontinued earlier. 
Amendment 4 (11-Dec-2015). As of 18 November 2015, 327 patients had been screened for enrollment and 
231 patients had been randomized. The primary purpose of this amendment provides follow up evaluations 
for hepatic toxicities and work-up guidelines for potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) cases in order to 
optimize the patient safety. 
At least one protocol deviation was reported in 48.7% of patients in the ceritinib arm and 47.4% of patients 
in the chemotherapy arm.

Baseline data 
The demographic characteristics of the patients in this study were consistent with those observed in patients 
with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC previously treated with multiple lines of therapy. The two treatment 
arms were well-balanced for the demographic characteristics except for race (70.4% vs. 58.6% Caucasian 
in the ceritinib arm vs. the chemotherapy arm, respectively) and ex-smokers (33.9% vs. 44.0% in the 
ceritinib arm vs. the chemotherapy arm, respectively). 
The disease characteristics of patients in this study were representative of the population of ALK-positive 
advanced NSCLC patients previously treated with multiple lines of therapy including crizotinib. Baseline 
disease characteristics were well-balanced between the two treatment arms. 
All except two patients (0.9%) had metastatic disease at study entry (two patients had Stage IIIB disease at 
study entry), with a metastatic pattern typical of patients with NSCLC. The most frequent metastasis sites 
were similar between treatment arms with lung metastases (100% vs. 99.1%), brain metastases (56.5% 
vs. 59.5%), bone metastases (53.9% vs. 50.9%), lymph nodes metastases (51.3% vs. 53.4%) in the 
ceritinib arm vs. chemotherapy arm, respectively

Primary efficacy endpoint – Progression-free survival 
The study met its primary objective showing a statistically significant and clinically meaningful benefit of 
ceritinib over chemotherapy in PFS by BIRC. 
Ceritinib was associated with a 51% PFS risk reduction (HR=0.49; 95% CI: 0.36, 0.67); this result was 
statistically significant (log-rank test stratified by WHO performance status and baseline brain metastases, 
p-value <0.001, one-sided)  
The median PFS as assessed by BIRC was 5.4 months (95% CI: 4.1, 6.9) and 1.6 months (95% CI: 1.4, 2.8) 
for the ceritinib arm and chemotherapy arm, respectively. There were 83 patients (72.2%) with events in 
the ceritinib arm and 89 patients (76.7%) with events in the chemotherapy arm.

•  Supportive analyses 
The results of the PFS analysis using the PPS were consistent with that of the primary analysis based on the 
FAS. The results yielded a HR of 0.50 (95% CI: 0.36, 0.69; p<0.001); the median PFS as assessed by BIRC 
(95% CI) was 5.4 months (95% CI: 4.1, 7.0) and 1.6 months (95% CI: 1.4, 2.8) for the ceritinib arm and 
chemotherapy arm, respectively. 
The following baseline covariates were included in a stratified multivariate Cox proportional hazard 
regression model for PFS by BIRC: stage of disease, geographic region, age, race, gender and previous 
response to crizotinib. The treatment effect hazard ratio (HR=0.49, 95% CI: 0.35, 0.68) after adjusting for 
the baseline covariates was similar to the stratified Cox regression model hazard ratio from the primary PFS 
analysis

start of anti-neoplastic therapy as a PFS event, excluding the start of anti-neoplastic therapy as a reason for 
censoring, including events for patients with at least two consecutive tumor assessments missing prior to 
the PFS events. PFS was also compared between the treatment arms including PD events assessed by either 
BIRC or Investigator as PFS events (whichever occurred earlier). The results of the predefined sensitivity 
analyses were consistent with the primary analysis. 
Secondary endpoints (OS) 
As pre-specified in both the protocol and the statistical analysis plan, OS was formally tested, based on a 
50% information fraction, as the primary efficacy endpoint PFS by BIRC assessment was statistically 
significant favoring the ceritinib arm. 
As of the data cut-off date, the median follow-up time for OS (from randomization to last contact date on or 
prior to the data cut-off date) was 10.9 months (range: 0.1 to 27.9 months) for the ceritinib arm and 9.3 
months for the chemotherapy arm (range: 0 to 29.2 months).

Figure 4 - Kaplan-Meier plot of overall survival by treatment arm (FAS) 
A total of 67 patients (58.3%) in the ceritinib arm were censored for survival including 60 patients who were 
alive and seven patients who were lost to follow-up as of the data cut-off date. In the chemotherapy arm, 66 
patients (56.9%) were censored for survival including 55 patients who were alive and 11 patients who were 
lost to follow-up as of the data cut-off date. 
The results for the supportive analysis for OS based on the PPS were similar to those assessed on the FAS 
(HR=0.99 with 95% CI: 0.65, 1.49; p=0.474) using stratified log-rank test and stratified Cox model. 
The following baseline covariates were included in a stratified multivariate Cox regression model for OS: 
stage of disease, geographic region, age, race, gender and previous response to crizotinib. The treatment 
effect hazard ratio after adjusting for these baseline covariates was comparable to the stratified Cox 
regression model hazard ratio from the primary OS analysis. 
A final analysis for OS is planned to be conducted when approximately 196 deaths are observed.

Seventy-five (65%) patients from the chemotherapy arm crossed-over to the ceritinib arm after 
BIRC-confirmed PD as part of the extension treatment phase, one patient died before receiving the first dose 
of ceritinib. In addition, nine patients who did not cross-over received an ALK-inhibitor as their first therapy 
after treatment discontinuation (seven ceritinib, two crizotinib). Thus, overall 83 patients (71.6%) in the 
chemotherapy arm have received an ALK-inhibitor as their first antineoplastic medication after 
discontinuation of the chemotherapy. After discontinuation of ceritinib, 17 patients (14.8%) received 
chemotherapy, of which eight patients (7.0%) received pemetrexed and six patients (5.2%) received 
docetaxel.  
Table 14: Selected first antineoplastic medications since treatment discontinuation 
A sensitivity analysis using rank-preserving structural failure time (RPSFT) was performed to correct for 
confounding introduced by the change of treatment when patients crossed-over. After adjustment for 
cross-over with the RPSFT model, the HR estimate from the RPSFT analysis was similar to the one from the 
primary OS analysis (HR=0.97; 95% CI: 0.65, 1.45).

Progression-free survival by Investigator assessment 
With a median follow-up for PFS of 5.4 months for the ceritinib arm and 1.5 months for the chemotherapy 
arm (range: 0.0 to 22.1) by Investigator assessment, the results of this PFS analysis corroborated the 
primary PFS analysis based on BIRC assessment. Ceritinib treatment demonstrated a statistically and 
clinically meaningful benefit over chemotherapy in prolonging PFS based on Investigator assessment 
(HR=0.40; 95% CI: 0.29, 0.54; stratified log-rank test, one-sided p<0.001). The estimated median PFS was 
6.7 months (95% CI: 4.4, 7.9) in the ceritinib arm vs. 1.6 months (95% CI: 1.4, 2.6) in the chemotherapy 
arm. The concordance rate for PFS between Investigator and BIRC assessments was a high (87.4%). 
Subgroup and sensitivity analyses of PFS by Investigator assessment were similar to those by BIRC. 
Figure 5 - Kaplan-Meier plot of progression-free survival per Investigator assessment by 
treatment arm (FAS) 
Overall response rate (BIRC and Investigator assessment) 
The ORR as assessed by BIRC was higher in the ceritinib arm compared to the chemotherapy arm (39.1% 
vs. 6.9%). Of the eight responders in the chemotherapy arm, seven patients were on pemetrexed and one 
patient was on docetaxel. The ORR was also higher in the ceritinib arm compared to the pemetrexed group 
(17.5%), and compared to the docetaxel group (1.4%). The BOR in both arms included PRs and no CRs. Of 
note, 16.5% and 51.7% of patients in the ceritinib and chemotherapy arm, respectively, had PD as BOR.  
Similar results were obtained for ORR when tumor responses were assessed by the Investigator. Of the 
seven responders in the chemotherapy arm, five patients were on pemetrexed and two patients were on 
docetaxel.

Table 15: Best overall response per BIRC assessment by treatment arm (FAS) 
Disease control rate (BIRC and Investigator assessment) 
Disease control rate (CR+PR+stable disease+Non-CR/Non-PD) as assessed by BIRC was nearly twice as 
high in the ceritinib arm compared to the chemotherapy arm (76.5% vs. 36.2%). Disease control rate was 
also higher in the ceritinib arm compared to the pemetrexed group (52.5%), and compared to the docetaxel 
group (28.8%). 
Similar results were obtained for DCR when tumor responses were assessed by the Investigator. 
Duration of response (BIRC and Investigator assessment) 
The responses were durable with a median DOR per BIRC assessment of 6.9 months (95% CI: 5.4, 8.9) in 
the ceritinib arm and 8.3 months (95% CI: 3.5, NE) in the chemotherapy arm in patients with a BOR of 
confirmed CR or PR (N=45 in the ceritinib arm, N=8 in the chemotherapy arm). Of these patients, 64.4% 
and 50.0% (ceritinib arm and chemotherapy arm, respectively) had an event (progression or death) at the 
date of the last tumor assessment prior to the data cut-off.  
The median DOR based on Investigator assessment was 5.9 months (95% CI: 5.4, 9.7) in the ceritinib arm 
and 4.3 months (95% CI: 2.8, NE) in the chemotherapy arm in patients with a BOR of confirmed CR or PR 
(N=45 in the ceritinib arm, N=8 in the chemotherapy arm). 71.4% patients in both treatment arms achieved 
a response of confirmed CR or PR had an event (progression or death) prior to the data cut-off.

Page 31/94 
 
  
  
 
 
Of note, the number of responders in the chemotherapy arm was very small, and consequently the 95% CI 
for the estimate of median DOR was wide. 
Time to response (BIRC and Investigator assessment) 
The onset of response was rapid; in patients with confirmed PR by BIRC, 80% of patients achieved the 
response during the first 12 weeks on treatment with ceritinib. The median time to first response was 6.7 
weeks in the ceritinib arm and 7.4 weeks in the chemotherapy arm. Using the Kaplan-Meier approach, the 
estimated probability of having a response within the first 18 weeks of treatment was 36.2% (95% CI: 28.1, 
46.0) for the ceritinib arm and 7.6% (95% CI: 3.9, 14.7) for the chemotherapy arm. 
Similar results were observed with Investigator’s assessed responses. Of note, the number of responders in 
the chemotherapy arm was very small, and consequently the 95% CI for the estimate of median DOR was 
wide.

Responses in patients with brain metastases 
Overall intracranial response rate, intracranial disease control rate (IDCR) and duration of intracranial 
response (DOIR) were assessed by an independent neuro-radiologist (intracranial BIRC) in a subset of 
patients with baseline brain metastases, and were calculated based on modified RECIST 1.1 to assess 
activity in the brain. 
• 
Patients with brain metastases at baseline 
Of a total of 133 patients with ALK-positive NSCLC and brain metastases at baseline, 66 patients (49.6%) 
were randomized in the ceritinib arm and 67 patients (50.4%) in the chemotherapy arm. Baseline and 
disease characteristics, relevant medical history, current medical conditions, prior anti-neoplastic therapies 
in this sub-population were consistent with the overall population and were well-balanced between the two 
treatment arms. Approximately 56% of patients in each treatment arm had received prior radiation to the 
brain. The median time from end of radiation to the brain to randomization was 3.9 months (range: 0.2 to 
44.7 months) in the ceritinib arm vs. 5.5 months (range: 0.0 to 23.8 months) in the chemotherapy arm.

Two patients in the chemotherapy arm were randomized but not treated. Forty-six patients (34.6%) had 
measurable lesions at baseline (23 patients each arm). Ten out of 46 patients (21.7%) with measurable 
disease had no valid post-baseline tumor assessment (6/23 in the ceritinib arm, 4/23 in the chemotherapy 
arm). 
•  Overall intracranial response 
The OIRR in patients with measurable disease (at least one target lesion) in the brain at baseline was higher 
in the ceritinib arm (26.1%, 95% CI: 10.2, 48.4) as compared to the chemotherapy arm (4.3%, 95% CI: 
0.1, 21.9). A high number of patients had unknown response, 26.1% in both the ceritinib arm and in the 
chemotherapy arm, mostly due to missing post-BL assessments. Excluding patients with no post-BL 
assessments from the analysis (n=6 in the ceritinib arm and n=3 in the chemotherapy arm), the OIRR was 
35.3% (95% CI: 14.2, 61.7) in the ceritinib arm and 5.0% (95% CI: 0.1, 24.9) in the chemotherapy arm. 
• 
Intracranial disease control rate 
The IDCR (ceritinib vs the chemotherapy) was 56.5% (95% CI: 34.5, 76.8) vs. 52.2% (95% CI: 30.6, 73.2) 
in patients with measurable disease. However, in the chemotherapy arm, only one patient had a PR in the 
brain, therefore, the IDCR was primarily driven by stable disease. Moreover, the median PFS in patients with 
baseline brain metastases (as per case report form [CRF] data) was much shorter in the chemotherapy arm 
compared to the ceritinib arm (1.5 months vs. 4.4 months) suggesting disease control in the brain was not 
durable with chemotherapy.

•  Duration of intracranial response 
Intracranial responses with ceritinib were durable, with a median DOIR of 6.9 months (95% CI: 2.7, 8.3) in 
the ceritinib arm in patients with measurable disease in the brain at baseline. The DOIR was not reached in 
the chemotherapy arm as the only patient eligible for analysis was censored (patient was ongoing without an 
event). 
Of note, the number of patients in subgroups and number of events (i.e. number of responders and number 
of intracranial PD events) were small. Since no tumor assessments were required after BIRC confirmed PD, 
this might have led to censoring of patients (in the DOIR analysis) who had extracranial but no intracranial 
progression, and did not die. Thus, the DOIR results have to be interpreted with caution.

Progression-free survival in patients with brain metastases 
In the subgroup of patients with brain metastases (based on CRF data) and the subgroup of patients without 
brain metastases at baseline, a positive treatment effect (based on median PFS) was demonstrated in favor 
of ceritinib vs. chemotherapy with the estimated HR of 0.54 and 0.41, respectively. The median PFS by BIRC 
and Investigator was longer in the ceritinib arm compared to the chemotherapy arm both in patients with 
brain metastases (based on CRF data) and without brain metastases. 
Patient reported outcomes 
Two instruments (LCSS and EORTC QLQ-C30/LC13) frequently used in clinical lung cancer studies and 
specifically designed to analyze lung cancer symptom changes were used to assess patient reported 
outcomes in Study A2303. In addition, EQ-5D, a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic 
appraisal was used to further assess patient reported outcomes. 
The compliance of patients completing the LCSS was high, ≥ 75% of patients in the ceritinib and 
chemotherapy arms completed the LCSS questionnaires at most of the time points during the course of the 
study. Significant improvements were reported for the majority of lung cancer specific symptoms for 
Zykadia compared to chemotherapy (four out of six LCSS and 10 out of 12 QLQ-LC13 symptom scores). 
Ceritinib significantly prolonged time to deterioration for the lung cancer specific symptoms of interest of 
cough, pain and dyspnoea (composite endpoint LCSS: HR=0.40; 95% CI: 0.25, 0.65, median Time to 
Deterioration [TTD] 18.0 months [95% CI: 13.4, NE] in the ceritinib arm versus 4.4 months [95% CI: 1.6, 
8.6] in the chemotherapy arm; LC13: HR=0.34; 95% CI: 0.22, 0. 52, median TTD 11.1 months [95% CI: 
7.1, 14.2] in the ceritinib arm versus 2.1 months [95% CI: 1.0, 5.6] in the chemotherapy arm). The EQ-5D 
questionnaire showed a significant overall health status improvement for Zykadia in comparison to the 
chemotherapy. 
Results for QLQ-LC13 questionnaire are consistent with the findings of the LCSS and show significant 
improvements in most symptoms. 
The QLQ-C30 questionnaire revealed improvements in half of its scales (7 out of 15) in patients treated with 
ceritinib; two scores related to nausea and vomiting as well as diarrhea showed better outcomes for 
chemotherapy arm.  
The EQ-5D questionnaire showed a significant overall health status improvement for ceritinib in comparison 
to the chemotherapy.

4.2.2.  Discussion 
Design 
In the EU, Zykadia was granted conditional marketing authorisation on 6 May 2015 for the treatment of adult 
patients with ALK positive advanced NSCLC previously treated with crizotinib, based on data from the Phase 
II Study A2201 and Study CLDK378A2203 (referred to as Study A2203) and updated data from the Phase I 
Study X2101. 
On July 2016, the MAH submitted the final analysis of the study A2201. Results from this final analysis were 
in line with those previously known from the primary analysis. Both the outcome from primary endpoint and 
values from the secondary endpoints, were maintained.  
Now, the MAH has submitted the data of the study A2303, which could fulfil the remaining Specific Obligation 
in Annex II. 
Study A2303 is a Phase III, global, randomized, open-label study of oral ceritinib (750 mg qd fasted) versus 
standard chemotherapy (pemetrexed/docetaxel) in adult patients with ALK positive NSCLC previously 
treated with chemotherapy (one or two prior regimens, including one platinum-based doublet) and 
crizotinib. 
The inclusion/exclusion criteria allowed the recruitment of Patients ≥ 18 years with locally advanced or 
metastatic ALK-positive (confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization test) NSCLC, prior therapy with 
crizotinib and one or two chemotherapy lines for advanced disease (including a platinum-based doublet), 
WHO PS 0-2, documented disease progression at study entry with at least one measurable lesion, adequate 
organ and bone marrow function; patients with symptomatic brain metastasis or carcinomatous meningitis

were excluded. Importantly, no particular sequence of prior crizotinib and chemotherapy was required for 
enrollment, and either could comprise the last treatment received by the patient. Even though, the inclusion 
criteria overall seem to reproduce someway the wording of the indication granted to ceritinib, would not be 
the clear reflection of the current clinical practice, given the treatments algorithms for stage IV ALK NSCLC, 
with crizotinib in first line and ceritinib after progression. 
Regarding the comparators used, pemetrexed (500 mg/m2 as an iv infusion over 10 minutes on Day 1 of 
each 21-day cycle) or docetaxel (75 mg/m2 infused iv over one hour on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle) can be 
considered as acceptable comparators as there seem to be a non-inferiority between pemetrexed and 
docetaxel in OS, even though pemetrexed would have a better tolerability with a significantly lower rate of 
neutropaenia and gastrointestinal AEs. Apparently, the choice of pemetrexed or docetaxel treatment in the 
chemotherapy arm was made by the Investigator taking into account prior therapy. 
The primary endpoint, PFS by BIRC, was evaluated (tumour evaluation) every six weeks (two cycles) after 
randomization during the first 18 months, and every nine weeks (three cycles) thereafter and at end of 
treatment. This approach is considered acceptable, seeing as response evaluation is recommended after 2–
3 cycles of chemotherapy (Novello et al. Ann Oncol 2016). PFS as primary endpoint with OS as key 
secondary endpoint, are agreeable, especially bearing in mind, firstly, the already known results from the 
phase II study A2201 and the cross-over design used in the A2303 study. 
Randomisation (1:1) was stratified by performance status and presence of brain metastases. Performance 
status and brain metastases are two well-known prognostic factors.  
According to the statistical analysis plan, the final PFS analysis was to be conducted when approximately 161 
BIRC-confirmed PFS events had been documented and all randomized patients completed at least 12 weeks 
of follow-up or discontinued earlier. 
Results 
From the 326 patients who were screened, 29.1% did not complete that phase, mainly due to screen failure. 
231 patients were randomised. One hundred and fifteen (115) patients received ceritinib and 116 patients 
received chemotherapy; among the 116 patients randomized to chemotherapy, 40 patients received 
pemetrexed, 73 patients received docetaxel. It is reassuring that at the time of the main analysis (PFS) more 
patients were ongoing in the ceritinib arm than in the chemotherapy group (28.7% vs 6.9%). Looking at the 
reasons for discontinuations, progressive disease was the main reason, followed by death and 
subject/physician’s decision. However, the latter, is not considered representative enough due to the 
relatively low number of deaths. 
The protocol was amended four times. Of them the most important when it comes to assessing the primary 
endpoint was the third one. In this one, after 191 patients had been randomised, the criterion to stop 
collecting tumor assessment, “start of new anti-cancer therapy”, was removed. The aim of this amendment 
was to enable sensitivity analysis of PFS following a pure intent -to-treat principle where start of new 
antineoplastic therapy did not result in censoring for PFS. 
Regarding the baseline characteristics (demographics), overall they seem to be evenly balanced, with a few 
imbalances in race and smoking status. All patients but two had metastatic disease, with brain metastases 
in half of patients approximately. Adenocarcinoma was the more predominant histology. Crizotinib was 
received by all patients, and 82% of them as last treatment. There is a slight imbalance in the response 
obtained from crizotinib; 46.9% vs 36.2% in ceritinib arm and chemotherapy group respectively showed 
response. 
In terms of primary endpoint (PFS by BIRC), the use of ceritinib is associated to a longer PFS, with a HR of 
0.49 (95%CI 0.36, 0.67). There is a clear separation of the curve from the beginning. The almost 4 months 
in the delay of tumour progression or death is considered clinically meaningful. These results seem robust

enough, both in number of events (72% for ceritinib arm and 76% for chemotherapy) and 
supportive-sensitivity analyses. More patients were censored in the ceritinib arm (27.8% vs 23.3%) with 
ongoing without event as main reason of censoring (19.1% vs 6.0% ceritinib vs chemotherapy 
respectively). Initiation of new anticancer therapy was the main reason for censuring in the control group. 
The PFS by investigator, in the PP population and in all the sensitivity analyses carried out by the MAH were 
consistent with the BIRC analysis. Even the stratified multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression model 
for PFS by BIRC, did not show any dissimilar result. On splitting the control group in the two different 
regimens used (pemetrexed and docetaxel) a better results seems to observe vs docetaxel (HR 0.32 95%CI 
0.22, 0.47) than with pemetrexed (HR 0.73 95%CI 0.47, 1.13) although the study was not designed to find 
differences with each regimen. The median PFS as assessed by BIRC was 2.9 months (95% CI: 1.5, 5.1) and 
1.5 months (95% CI: 1.4, 1.8) for pemetrexed and docetaxel, respectively, versus 5.4 months (95% CI: 
4.1, 6.9) for ceritinib. Finally, the PFS results in the different subgroups analysed (including the 
stratifications strata) were consistent with the whole population 
Results for OS are not conclusive, with no differences between groups (HR 1.00 95%CI 0.67, 1.49). The 
percentage of events (42% and 43%) and number of patients (75 [65%]) who crossed-over to ceritinib 
along with the subsequent therapy with ALK inhibitors (71.6% vs 14.8% ceritinib vs chemotherapy 
respectively), are likely to have influenced the absence of differences in OS. Nevertheless, after a sensitivity 
analysis with the aim of correcting for crossover was carried out, the HR remained similar to the original (HR 
0.97 95%CI 0.65, 1.45). The latter warrants even more an update of the OS data. 
ORR was higher for those patients treated with ceritinib, with almost 40% of responders vs 7% in the 
chemotherapy arm. Of note, no complete responses were observed in any arm. Despite this higher ORR, the 
duration of the response was pretty similar between groups with 7 and 8 months in ceritinib and 
chemotherapy groups respectively. A more interesting fact of the antitumor activity of ceritinib is the effect 
on brain metastases. The overall intracranial response by BIRC was 26% vs 4 % in ceritinib vs control group. 
Despite the limited sample size of this subset of patients (46) this is considered an added value, since the 
high prevalence of brain metastases in those patients with ALK positive (around 50%) and the low 
bioavailability of crizotinib in the cerebrospinal fluid. 
Overall, results from this phase III confirmatory trial are in line with those obtained from previous studies. 
ORR seems similar to response rate seen in the study A2201 (35.7%) and the median PFS by BIRC was 7.1 
months in the A2201 trial and 5.4 months according to investigator’s assessment. 
In conclusion, data from the phase III trial, study A2303, show a clinically meaningful result, both in PFS and 
ORR. OS data are not mature enough and the applicant is recommended to submit updates. These results 
confirm the preliminary data from the previous studies which were the basis of the conditional MA and 
constitute a comprehensive data package. 
4.3.  Clinical Safety aspects 
This Summary of Clinical Safety (SCS) is primarily based on data from Phase III Study A2303 to further 
confirm  the  safety  of  ceritinib  in  the  target  population  of  patients  with  locally  advanced  or  metastatic 
ALK-positive NSCLC disease previously treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy and crizotinib.  
The SCS reviews the safety data from the confirmatory, randomized Phase III Study A2303 comprising of 
231 patients, which were randomized (1:1 ratio) to receive either ceritinib 750 mg once daily fasted (n=115, 
consisted of all patients who received at least one dose of study drug) or chemotherapy (n=116; including 
40 patients and 73 patients treated with pemetrexed and docetaxel respectively, three patients were not 
treated). Additional safety information (cumulative line listings of deaths and SAEs) were reported in the 
Applicant global pharmacovigilance safety database (ARGUS) for the other ongoing studies in the ceritinib 
program until 10-Aug-2016. There was no pooling of safety data. 
Assessment report  
EMA/367341/2017

Patients randomized to chemotherapy were allowed to cross-over and receive ceritinib after BIRC-confirmed 
disease progression (extension-treatment phase). Seventy-five patients crossed over to ceritinib, and 
entered the extension-treatment phase. One patient died before starting the first dose of ceritinib in the 
extension-treatment phase and 74 received ceritinib. 
The median duration of follow-up (from randomization to data cut-off date 26-Jan-2016) for all patients was 
16.5 months for Study A2303, and the median duration of exposure to ceritinib was 30.3 weeks (range: 0.3 
to 122.9) and to chemotherapy was 6.3 weeks (range: 3.0 to 69.1), more patients discontinued treatment 
with chemotherapy (108 patients, 93.1%) than with ceritinib (82 patients, 71.3%) at the time of the data 
cut-off (26-Jan-2016). Treatment was ongoing for 33 patients (28.7%) in the ceritinib group and for eight 
patients (6.9%) in the chemotherapy group at the time of the data cut-off. 
No specific long-term studies were conducted, and there is limited information regarding prolonged 
exposure of patients to ceritinib in clinical trials. In Study A2303, 47% of patients were exposed to ceritinib 
for a period of ≥ 33 weeks. 
4.3.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Study A2303 is an open-label, randomized, active-controlled, global Phase III study to compare the efficacy 
and safety of ceritinib to standard, second-line, chemotherapy (pemetrexed or docetaxel) in patients with 
ALK-positive advanced NSCLC (harboring a confirmed ALK rearrangement). Patients were previously treated 
with chemotherapy (one or two prior regimens, including one platinum-based doublet) and crizotinib. No 
particular sequence of prior chemotherapy and crizotinib was required for enrollment, and either could 
comprise the last treatment received by the patient. 
Patients were treated until Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) confirmed disease 
progression by BIRC, unacceptable toxicity, or other discontinuation criteria were met. Patients in the 
chemotherapy arm were allowed to cross -over and receive ceritinib after BIRC-confirmed disease 
progression (extension-treatment phase). Moreover, patients in either arm of the study with 
BIRC-confirmed disease progression were allowed to continue the assigned study treatment beyond initial 
progression in case of continued clinical benefit as per the Investigator's opinion. 
Safety data in the present SCS was analysed using the Safety set consisting of all patients who received at 
least one dose of study drug. Patients were analyzed as applicable according to the study treatment or the 
study drug they received, where treatment received was defined as (i) the intended treatment if it was 
received at least once, or (ii) the first treatment received when starting therapy with study medication if 
intended treatment was never received. Each patient was classified into and analyzed consistently within 
one (and only one) treatment group. 
The Cross-over analysis set consisted of patients randomized to the chemotherapy who crossed over to 
receive at least one dose of ceritinib. This analysis set was used for all safety evaluations collected after 
patients crossed over into the extension-treatment phase. 
The key study design features and safety endpoints are summarized in Table 18.

The Safety set (ceritinib group: N=115; chemotherapy group: N=113) consisted of all patients who 
received at least one dose of study drug. Patients were analyzed as applicable according to the study 
treatment or the study drug they received. 
The Cross-over analysis set (N=74) consisted of patients randomized to the chemotherapy who crossed 
over to receive at least one dose of ceritinib. This analysis set was used for all safety evaluations collected 
after patients crossed over into the extension treatment phase.

Additional safety information (cumulative line listings of deaths and SAEs) reported in the Novartis global 
pharmacovigilance safety database (ARGUS) for the other ongoing studies received as of the 10-Aug-2016 
are also provided. 
The latest [Zykadia PSUR 4] provides additional information in post-marketing setting as follows: 
•  A review of post-marketing data, including the spontaneous reports, the reports received directly from 
the worldwide regulatory authorities. 
•  A review of SAE reported from ongoing studies submitted to the Novartis Drug Safety and Epidemiology 
department. 
•  A  worldwide  literature  search,  to  capture  any  Investigator  published  reported  on  safety  aspects  not 
included in the study reports. 
4.3.2.  Results 
This overall safety evaluation is based on data from 228 patients (115 received ceritinib and 113 patients 
received chemotherapy) from the comparative Study A2303. Patients treated with ceritinib have been 
exposed to the drug at the recommended dosing regimen of 750 mg once daily (fasted condition). 
Assessment report  
EMA/367341/2017 
Page 39/94 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
In addition, the analysis of safety data (n=74) after cross-over from chemotherapy to ceritinib was 
conducted separately, based on extension-treatment period i.e., from day of first dose of extension ceritinib 
treatment to 30 days after the last dose of extension ceritinib treatment. This allows an informed 
assessment of the safety profile of ceritinib and a judgment of the overall benefit-risk of ceritinib in patients 
with ALK-positive NSCLC. 
Exposure to treatment - Patient disposition 
Overall, 231 patients were randomized; 115 were randomized to treatment with ceritinib and 116 to 
treatment with chemotherapy. Three patients in the chemotherapy group (two patients due to Investigators 
decision and one due to subject/guardian’s decision) were not treated. With a median duration of follow-up 
of 16.5 months (from randomization to data cut-off date) for Study A2303, more patients discontinued 
treatment with chemotherapy (108 patients, 93.1%) than with ceritinib (82 patients, 71.3%) at the time of 
the data cut-off (26-Jan-2016). Treatment was ongoing for 33 patients (28.7%) in the ceritinib group and 
for eight patients (6.9%) in the chemotherapy group at the time of the data cut-off. 
In the treatment phase, the primary reason for treatment discontinuation in both the treatment groups was 
disease progression, although there were a greater proportion of discontinuations in chemotherapy group 
attributable to progression (82 patients (70.7%) in chemotherapy vs. 56 patients (48.7%) in the ceritinib 
group). Treatment discontinuation attributable to AEs was comparable between the chemotherapy and 
ceritinib groups (eight patients (6.9%) in chemotherapy vs. six patients (5.2%) in ceritinib group) (Table 
20). Overall 14 patients (nine patients (7.8%) in ceritinib group, and five patients (4.3%) in the 
chemotherapy group) discontinued due to death; 12 of these 14 deaths were attributed to the underlying 
malignancy. Causes of death for the remaining two cases (both in ceritinib group) included respiratory 
failure and cerebrovascular accident, were consistent with what would be expected in a population with 
advanced cancer and with other comorbid conditions, and were not study drug-related. In addition, more 
than half of the ceritinib patients continued the treatment beyond BIRC –confirmed PD (for more than 6 
weeks) while none of chemotherapy patients did continue beyond PD (for more than 6 weeks). 
Seventy-five patients (74 patients from treatment phase and one from post-treatment followup phase) from 
the chemotherapy group (48 patients from the docetaxel group and 27 patients from the pemetrexed group) 
crossed over to ceritinib, and entered the extension-treatment phase. All the 75 patients who crossed-over 
had BIRC-confirmed PD at the time of cross-over, except for one patient who was reported as a protocol 
deviation. One of these 75 patients died before starting the first dose of ceritinib in the extension-treatment 
phase, and 74 received ceritinib. At the time of the data cut-off, 28/75 patients (37.3%) in the 
extension-treatment phase were still ongoing. Forty-seven of the 75 patients discontinued the 
extension-treatment phase, and the primary reasons for discontinuation were disease progression (24 
patients) or deaths (15 patients) (Table 20).

Dose reductions and interruptions 
The dose interruptions and dose reductions were more frequent among patients receiving ceritinib than for 
the chemotherapy group. These dose adjustments were primarily attributable to AEs.  
Overall, 70 patients (60.9%), seven patients (17.5%), and 19 patients (26.0%) required at least one dose 
reduction for ceritinib, pemetrexed, and docetaxel, respectively; with 29.6%, 15.0%, and 21.9% of patients 
requiring only one dose reduction for ceritinib, pemetrexed, and docetaxel. Among the patients with at least 
one dose reduction, the primary reason for dose reductions were AEs (ceritinib group: 90.0%, pemetrexed 
group: 100%, and docetaxel group: 94.7%). In the ceritinib group, the dose adjustments were primarily due 
to hepatotoxicity and GI AEs. 
Dose reductions occurred throughout the treatment period with a higher percentage of dose reductions 
occurring during Weeks 3 to 6. The median time to first dose reduction in the ceritinib group was 7.0 weeks 
(range: 0.4 to 46.0 weeks), in pemetrexed group was 6.0 weeks (range: 3.3 to 45.1 weeks), and in 
docetaxel group was 3.1 weeks (range: 2.9 to 15.1 weeks). 
Overall, 88 patients (76.5%), 10 patients (25.0%), and four patients (5.5%) required at least one dose 
interruption/delay of ceritinib, pemetrexed, and docetaxel, respectively; with 26.1%, 22.5%, and 5.5% of 
patients requiring only one dose interruption/delay for ceritinib, pemetrexed, and docetaxel. Among the 
patients with at least one dose interruption/delay, the primary reason were AEs (ceritinib group: 96.6%, 
pemetrexed group: 90.0%, and docetaxel group: 75.0%). In the ceritinib group, the dose interruptions or 
delay were primarily due to hepatotoxicity and GI AEs. The median time to first dose interruption was 5.9 
weeks (range: 0.3 to 75.1 weeks) in the ceritinib group and 6.4 weeks (range: 3.1 to 33.4 weeks) in the 
pemetrexed group and 8.4 weeks (range: 3.1 to 18.0 weeks) in the docetaxel group.

Demographic and other characteristics of study population 
The demographic, disease, and other baseline characteristics of patients recruited into Study A2303 are 
consistent with the targeted population of patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC previously treated 
chemotherapy and crizotinib.  
The two treatment groups were well-balanced for the demographic characteristics assessed except for race 
and smoking history. There were a higher proportion of Caucasian in the ceritinib group vs. chemotherapy 
group (70.4% vs. 58.6%). Ex-smokers were lower in the ceritinib group vs. chemotherapy group (33.9 vs. 
44.0%). 
In the ceritinib group, the median age was 54.0 years (range: 30 -77 years) and 77.4% of the patients were 
<65 years old. In line with the geographical location of the enrolling sites, the majority of the patients were 
Caucasian (70.4%) followed by Asian (26.1%), and a broad representation of ethnicities reflects the 
countries who participated in this study. In addition, 48.7% of the patients entered the study with a WHO PS 
score of 0 and 51.3% with a WHO PS score of 1-2. The proportion of patients who had never smoked was 
61.7%; 3.5% patients were current smokers at the time of study entry. The demographic characteristics 
were generally similar between each of the chemotherapy types (pemetrexed and docetaxel) with some 
difference noted with respect to age, gender and ex-smokers. 
• 
• 
• 
Age:  There  were  a  higher  proportion  of  patients  with  ≥  65  years  in  the  docetaxel  group  vs. 
pemetrexed group (27.4% vs. 15.0%). 
Gender: Females were higher in pemetrexed vs. docetaxel group (62.5% vs. 49.3%). 
Ex-smokers: 52.5% of patients in the pemetrexed group vs. 41.1% of patients in the docetaxel group. 
The demographic characteristics of the patients in the chemotherapy group who crossed–over to ceritinib 
treatment in the extension-treatment phase were consistent with those observed in patients in the 
treatment phase, except for the WHO PS which was worse at the time of crossover as compared to at the 
time of enrollment into the chemotherapy group. The proportion of patients with WHO PS at start of 
extension-treatment phase vs. at the time of enrollment into chemotherapy group was as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
WHO PS 0: 21.6% vs 44.0% 
WHO PS 1: 63.5% vs. 51.7% 
WHO PS 2: 10.8% vs. 4.3% 
WHO PS >2: 4.1% vs. 0 
Disease characteristics were representative of the population of ALK-positive NSCLC patients with 
metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy (one or two prior regimens, including one 
platinum-based doublet) and crizotinib. Baseline disease characteristics were well-balanced between the 
two treatment groups. Almost all patients (99.1%) presented with Stage IV disease at the time of study 
entry, two patients (0.9%) had Stage IIIB disease. All patients had metastatic disease, with a metastatic 
pattern typical of patients with NSCLC – lung metastases (100% vs. 99.1%), brain metastases (56.5% vs. 
59.5%), bone metastases (53.9% vs. 50.9%), lymph nodes metastases (51.3% vs. 53.4%), and liver 
metastasis (38.3% vs. 32.8%) in ceritinib arm vs chemotherapy arm. The median time from initial diagnosis 
of the primary site was 19.4 months (range: 5.5 to 153.3) and for chemotherapy was 19.8 months (range: 
6.5 to 115.9). The median time since the most recent recurrence/relapse to randomization was same for 
both the treatment groups (0.8 months). 
Previous antineoplastic treatments administered were representative of those routinely used for the 
treatment of NSCLC, and were generally well-balanced between treatment arms. All patients were treated 
with at least one prior regimen of crizotinib for advanced disease as per the inclusion criteria, of which three 
patients (1.3%) had received crizotinib more than once. A total of 189 (81.8%) patients took crizotinib as 
their last treatment prior to study enrollment. All patients received chemotherapy including a 
platinum-based doublet (one patient did not received prior platinum-based doublet therapy) for advanced

NSCLC as per the inclusion criteria; 11.7% of patients had received two lines of prior chemotherapy, and 
none of the patient received three lines of prior chemotherapy for advanced disease. Most patients had 
received approved/commonly used drugs for the treatment of NSCLC, the most frequently (in ≥ 10% of 
patients) used medications included: crizotinib (100%), pemetrexed (70.6%), cisplatin (63.6%), 
carboplatin (42.4%), gemcitabine (16.9%), paclitaxel (14.3%), and bevacizumab (13.4%). 
A total of 29.4% patients had prior surgery and 55.4% patients had been treated with prior radiotherapy, 
35.9% of the patients had received prior radiation therapy to the brain. The median time from the end date 
of radiotherapy to the brain to randomization was 6.4 months (range: 0.0 to 44.7). With the exception of 
prior taxanes and pemetrexed, prior antineoplastic therapies (including surgery, radiation and medication) 
in the patients who were treated with pemetrexed or docetaxel were similar and consistent with the overall 
population. 
Adverse events 
The overall incidence of AEs was similar for ceritinib (100%) and chemotherapy group (99.1%); however, 
grade 3/4 AEs, suspected AEs, SAEs, AEs requiring dose adjustments, interruptions/delay were reported 
more frequently in the ceritinib group (with a difference of ≥ 10% relative to chemotherapy group).  
The AEs by treatment group are presented in Table 21.

Common adverse events 
Adverse events regardless of study drug relationship were experienced by 100% of patients ceritinib group 
and 99.1% of the chemotherapy group. The SOCs where AEs were reported in ≥ 30% of patients in either of 
the treatment groups included (Table 22):

GGT increased, creatinine increased) 
Gastrointestinal disorders (+36.4%) (primarily diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting) 
Metabolism and nutrition disorders (+26.4%) (primarily decreased appetite) 
These toxicities are manageable in clinical setting and treatment discontinuation due to these was low: only 
two patients (1.7%) discontinued the treatment due to transaminitis (suspected to be study drug-related) 
and one patient (0.9%) due to vomiting (not suspected to be study drug-related). 
As expected, AEs of the SOC blood and lymphatic system disorders were reported more frequently in the 
chemotherapy group compared to the ceritinib group (+29.4% of patients). 
The SOCs where grade 3/4 AEs were reported in ≥ 10% of patients in either of the treatment groups

Alopecia (31.5%), neutropenia (27.4%), diarrhea (26.0%), fatigue (24.7%), and decreased 
appetite (23.3%) were the most frequently reported AEs (in ≥ 20% of patients) in the patients 
receiving docetaxel. 
The majority of patients (77.4%) receiving ceritinib therapy had grade 3/4 AEs regardless of study drug 
relationship; of these, 61.7% and 15.7% of patients had a grade 3 event and a grade 4 event, respectively. 
In comparison, grade 3/4 events were reported in 63.7% of patients in the chemotherapy treatment group;

Events suspected to be drug-related 
Overall, 95.7% of patients treated with ceritinib had AEs suspected to be study drug –related compared to 
78.8% of patients treated with chemotherapy. The most frequently reported AEs (in ≥ 20% of patients) 
suspected as being drug-related in the ceritinib group included: diarrhea (63.5%), nausea (60.9%),

Fatigue (23.9%) was the most commonly occuring AE suspected as being drug-related in the chemotherapy 
group (Table 24). The AEs suspected to be related to ceritinib treatment are consistent with the known 
safety profile of ceritinib. 
Grade 3/4 AEs suspected to be related to study treatment were reported in 52.2% and 36.3% of patients in 
the ceritinib group and chemotherapy group, respectively. The most frequently reported (in ≥ 10% of 
patients) grade 3/4 AEs suspected as being drug-related in the ceritinib included: ALT increased (20.9%),

In Study A2303, any terms not listed in the current reference safety information and occurring in more than 
2% of patients and/or in at least 3 patients in the ceritinib group (n=115) compared to the chemotherapy 
group (n=113) were selected as new potential adverse drug reaction (ADR) candidates.  
One new ADR and one additional term for the already existing ADR of liver laboratory test abnormalities was 
identified (Table 25). 
Table 25: Newly identified adverse drug reactions for ceritinib treatment 
Serious adverse events 
Serious adverse events regardless of study drug relationship were reported in 42.6% of patients in the 
ceritinib group and 31.9% of patients in the chemotherapy group, with majority (39.1% vs. 30.1%) of these 
were grade 3/4 in both the treatment groups (Table 26). 
The incidence of individual SAEs was low for both treatment groups, and commonly associated with 
underlying disease progression. The most frequently reported (in ≥ 2% of patients) SAEs in patients 
receiving ceritinib treatment were dyspnea (6.1%); nausea (5.2%); general physical health deterioration, 
pleural effusion, pneumonia, and vomiting (each 4.3%), pericardial effusion and pyrexia (each 3.5%), and 
respiratory failure (2.6%). Whereas in chemotherapy group dyspnea (4.4%) and asthenia (2.7%) were 
reported most frequently (Table 26). 
Thirteen patients (11.3%) from the ceritinib group and 12 patients (10.6%) from the chemotherapy group 
experienced SAEs that were suspected by the Investigator to be related to study treatment. The most 
commonly reported (in ≥ 2% of patients) study drug-related SAEs in the ceritinib group were nausea (four 
patients, 3.5%) and vomiting (three patients, 2.6%). 
Majority of these SAEs suspected to be drug-related were grade 3/4 in severity in both the treatment groups 
(10.4% vs. 9.7% in ceritinib vs. chemotherapy). Most of these events were single occurrences except for 
few of the events in the ceritinib group: nausea (three patients, 2.6%), vomiting and general health 
deterioration (two patients, 1.7% each). 
There were no drug related SAEs with fatal outcome except one patient in the ceritinib group; this patient 
[A2303-1255-002] had an SAE of general status health deterioration in the context of disease progression 
and subsequently died. The SAE was considered to be study drug related as the Investigator could not 
exclude some contribution of study treatment to general status health deterioration; however the patient 
died due to disease progression. 
The incidence of serious AESIs in the ceritinib group (irrespective of causality) in the Study A2303 included: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Hepatotoxicity: one patient (0.9%) 
ILD/pneumonitis: two patients (1.7%) 
QT prolongation: two patients (1.7%)

None of the drug-related AESIs were the primary cause of death.  
Table 26: Serious adverse events regardless of study drug relationship, by treatment group, and 
preferred term (Safety set) 
Deaths 
As of the data cut-off of 26-Jan-2016, 98 deaths were reported in the study. The incidence of deaths was 
similar in the two treatment groups, 48 patients (41.7%) and 50 patients (44.2%) died in the ceritinib and 
chemotherapy groups, respectively. Majority of these deaths in both the treatment groups (42/48 deaths in 
ceritinib and 43/50 deaths in chemotherapy group) were attributed to underlying disease. There were no 
deaths due to study drug-related AEs, except for one patient who died in the extension-treatment phase. 
This patient was initially treated with pemetrexed and crossed-over to ceritinib after disease progression in 
the lung. On Day 101, the patient was noted with Grade 3 hypertension and received the first dose of 
ceritinib on the same day. Two weeks later, the patient was hospitalized due to nausea, and was diagnosed 
with pulmonary embolism the next day. Due to further worsening of the clinical condition and respiratory 
insufficiency, palliative sedation was started, and the patient died on Day 121 due to the event (pulmonary 
embolism). The investigator could not exclude a possible relationship with study drug. 
The on-treatment deaths were reported for 20 patients (15 patients (13.0%) and five patients (4.4%) in the 
ceritinib and chemotherapy treatment groups, respectively) (Table 27). Eighteen of these 20 on-treatment 
deaths were attributed to the underlying malignancy/or disease progression. Cause of death for the 
remaining two cases (both in ceritinib group) were reported as “other causes” which included

cerebrovascular accident and respiratory failure (in the context of disease progression), and were assessed 
as not related to ceritinib by the Investigator. Overall, the causes of death were consistent with what would 
be expected in a population with NSCLC and with other comorbid conditions. The slightly higher frequency of 
on-treatment deaths in the ceritinib could be attributed to the high rate of early disease progression in the 
chemotherapy group resulting short treatment exposure (6.3 weeks for chemotherapy vs. 30.3 weeks for 
ceritinib). In addition patients with disease progression in the chemotherapy group discontinued study 
treatment while more than half of the patients in the ceritinib group continued treatment with ceritinib 
beyond disease progression. On-treatment deaths occurred throughout the treatment period with a 
mean/median time from treatment start until occurrence of on-treatment death of 137/52 days and 70/28 
days in the ceritin ib and chemotherapy groups, respectively; the frequency of on-treatment deaths during 
the first 6 weeks of study treatment was similar between the two groups. 
Narratives of patients who died due to other causes in Study A2303 are presented in Table 28.

Adverse events leading to discontinuation 
The frequency AEs leading to study drug discontinuation was similar in both the treatment groups (18 
patients [15.7%] vs. 11 patients [9.7%] in ceritinib vs. chemotherapy group), and majority of these AEs 
were grade 3/4 in both the treatment groups (15 patients [13.0%] vs. nine patients [8.0%]). 
The AEs reported (in ≥ 1% of the patients) leading to discontinuation in the ceritinib group were dyspnea 
(three patients, 2.6%), ALT increased, AST increased, pericardial effusion, general physical health 
deterioration, and pleural effusion (two patients, 1.7% each). 
In the chemotherapy group, with the exception of asthenia and dyspnea which led to the discontinuation of 
study treatment in four and two patients, respectively, all other AEs leading to study drug discontinuation 
were single events. 
Of the 18 patients who discontinued study treatment due to AEs in the ceritinib group, on medical review 
most of the AEs were related to disease progression and/or the underlying disease and were not considered 
causally related to study treatment as per Investigator assessment. Six patients had AEs which were 
considered to be drug-related by the Investigator which included transaminitis (n=2), general physical 
health deterioration (n=1), pericarditis (n=1), ILD (n=1), and pleural effusion (n=1). The reasons for other 
patients could be attributed to worsening of underlying disease and other co-morbidities.

Adverse events requiring dose adjustment or interruption 
Adverse events regardless of study drug relationship requiring dose adjustment were more frequent in the 
ceritinib group (36.5% vs. 21.2% in chemotherapy group) (Table 30). The most frequently occurring AEs (in 
≥ 2% of patients) that required dose adjustments in either treatment group included: 
• Ceritinib: ALT increased (9.6%), vomiting (8.7%), nausea (7.8%), and diarrhea (5.2%), AST increased 
and decreased appetite (3.5% each), blood creatinine increased, fatigue, and weight decreased (2.6% 
each). 
• Chemotherapy: neutropenia (6.2%), fatigue and neutrophil count decreased (3.5% each) 
Grade 3/4 events requiring dose adjustments were reported in 9.6% patients in the ceritinib group and in 
18.6% patients in the chemotherapy group. The incidence of individual grade 3/4 AEs requiring a dose 
adjustment was low. The most frequent AEs (in ≥ 2% of patients) requiring a dose adjustment in the 
ceritinib group were ALT increased and vomiting (2.6% each), and in the chemotherapy group were 
neutropenia (5.3%) and neutrophil count decreased (3.5%) (Table 30).

more frequently in the ceritinib group (73.0% vs. 23.9% in chemotherapy treatment group). The most 
frequently occurring AEs (in ≥2% of patients) requiring ceritinib dose interruption or delay in either 
treatment group included (Table 31):

Grade 3/4 events requiring dose interruption or delay were reported in 50.4% of patients in the ceritinib 
group and 10.6% of patients in the chemotherapy group. The most frequent grade 3/4 AEs (in ≥ 2% of 
patients) requiring an interruption or delay in the ceritinib group were ALT increased (18.3%), AST increased 
(12.2%), GGT increased (8.7%), nausea (6.1%), vomiting and fatigue (4.3% each), diarrhea and asthenia 
(3.5% each), blood ALP increased and pneumonia (2.6% each). None of the patients in the chemotherapy

Adverse events requiring additional therapy (which included all non-drug therapy in addition to concomitant 
medications) were reported in 92.2% of patients in the ceritinib group and in 88.5% of patients in the

49.6% of patients in the chemotherapy group. The most frequently grade 3/4 AEs (in ≥ 2% of patients) 
requiring additional therapy included (Table 32):

Ceritinib group: nausea (7.8%), vomiting (7.0%), hypokalaemia (5.2%), dyspnea (4.3%), and ALT 
increased (2.6%)

(5.3%), anemia (3.5%), dyspnea, back pain, and arthralgia (each 2.7%). 
Table 32: Adverse events requiring additional therapy, regardless of study drug relationship, by 
preferred term and treatment group (with a frequency cut-off of 5% in any group) (Safety set) 
Adverse events of special interest  
The  AEs  of  special  interest  (AESI)  are:  hepatotoxicity,  interstitial  lung  disease/pneumonitis,  QTc 
prolongation, hyperglycemia, bradycardia, GI toxicity (nausea, diarrhea, vomiting) and pancreatitis. 
None of the study drug-related AESIs were the primary cause of death. 
Hepatotoxicity 
The SMQ (narrow) ‘Cholestasis and jaundice of hepatic origin’, SMQ (narrow) ‘Hepatic failure, fibrosis and 
cirrhosis and other liver damage-related conditions’, SMQ (narrow) ‘Hepatitis, non-infectious’, and SMQ 
(narrow) ‘Liver related investigations, signs and symptoms’ were used to identify and define the frequency 
of hepatotoxicity events. 
Assessment report  
EMA/367341/2017 
Page 56/94 
 
  
  
 
Hepatotoxicity AEs were reported in 61 patients (53.0%), with grade 3/4 hepatotoxicity AEs reported in 44 
patients (38.3%). As per Investigator assessment hepatotoxicity AEs were suspected to be drug-related in 
56 patients (48.7%). The hepatotoxicity AEs required dose adjustments or interruptions/delay in 42 patients 
(36.5%) and led to discontinuations in two patients (1.7%). The event was serious in one patient (0.9%). 
The most frequent (in ≥ 20% of patients) hepatotoxicity AEs (all grades, regardless of study drug 
relationship) by preferred term were: ALT increased (42.6%), AST increased (36.5%), and GGT increased 
(22.6%). 
Hepatotoxicity SAE was reported only in one patient [A2303-1250-001], who developed grade 3 jaundice on 
Day 668 due to biliary obstruction, and was not suspected to be drug-related, and resolved upon biliary 
stent. 
Two patients (1.7%) discontinued ceritinib treatment due to ALT and AST increased, which were suspected 
to be drug-related and recovered after treatment discontinuation. 
Of the 115 patients treated with ceritinib, the majority of patients (89 patients, 77.4%) had grade 0 ALT at 
baseline, 25 patients (21.7%) had grade 1 and one patient (0.9%) and had grade 2 elevations at baseline. 
Post-baseline, 93 patients (80.9%) had ALT elevation of any grade, of which 37 patients (32.2%) had grade 
1, 28 patients (24.3%) had grade 2, 26 patients (22.6%) had grade 3, and two patients (1.7%) had grade 
4 ALT elevations, respectively. Of the 26 patients who worsened to grade 3, 21 patients worsened from 
baseline grade 0 and five patients worsened from baseline grade 1. Two patients worsened from baseline 
grade 0 to grade 4 post-baseline. 
Of the 115 patients treated with ceritinib, the majority of patients had grade 0 (93 patients, 80.9%) at 
baseline, and 22 patients (19.1%) grade 1 AST elevation at baseline. Post-baseline, 87 patients (75.7%) 
had AST elevation of any grade, 52 patients (45.2%) had grade 1, 18 patients (15.7%) had grade 2, 16 
patients (13.9%) had grade 3, and one patient (0.9%) had grade 4 AST elevation, respectively. Of the 16 
patients who worsened to grade 3, 13 patients worsened from baseline grade 0 and three patients worsened 
from baseline grade 1. One patient worsened from baseline grade 0 to grade 4 post-baseline. 
Overall increases in transaminases (ALT or AST) >3 x ULN (grade 2), were seen in 48.7% of patients, with 
26.1% and 1.7% of patients having an increase of >5 x ULN (grade 3) and >20 x ULN (grade 4), respectively 
in the ceritinib group. 
The median time to first elevation of grade 2 or worse AST or ALT increase was 27.0 weeks (95% CI: 15.3, 
45.9). The median time to first elevation of grade 3 or worse AST or ALT was not reached in the ceritinib 
group. Among the 30 patients with grade 3 or worse AST or ALT elevations, 23 patients (77%) had the 
elevation before 24 weeks. 
All patients treated with ceritinib had grade 0 total bilirubin at baseline. Post-baseline, one patient (0.9%) 
had grade 3 total bilirubin (TBILI) increases. Patient [A2303-1250-001] had jaundice due to biliary 
obstruction, which was not considered to be study drug-related. There were no grade 4 cases. 
No Hy’s law case was observed in either treatment group (i.e. concurrent AT >3xULN and TBILI >2xULN and 
ALP <2xULN). Further there were no cases of concurrent AT >3ULN and TBILI >2xULN in the ceritinib group. 
One patient [A2303-1250-001] in the ceritinib group had elevation of total bilirubin >2xULN and ALT or AST 
>3xULN at any time during the study (not necessarily concurrently). This patient had jaundiced due to 
biliary obstruction (not suspected to be study drug-related) and elevated alkaline phosphate during the 
event. The patient recovered upon biliary stent placement. 
The review of the overall safety profile of ceritinib in patients with mild hepatic impairment at baseline versus 
patients with normal hepatic function at baseline did not reveal any clinically relevant differences or new 
safety concerns, and is consistent with the known safety profile of ceritinib. No patients with 
moderate/severe hepatic impairment at baseline were enrolled into Study A2303. 
Assessment report  
EMA/367341/2017 
Page 57/94 
 
  
  
The interpretation of the slightly higher incidence of on-treatment deaths in ceritinib treated patients with 
mild hepatic impairment at baseline compared to patients with normal hepatic function at baseline is limited 
due to the small subgroup size and limited number of patients with an event. All deaths were due to study 
indication. 
Interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis 
The SMQ (narrow) “Interstitial lung disease” and the PT ‘Acute lung injury’ were used to identify and define 
the frequency of interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis events. 
Interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis AEs were reported in two patients (1.7%). The events were of grade 3 
severity and serious in both the patients. One patient each had grade 3 AE of ILD (suspected to be 
drug-related) and lung infiltration (not suspected to be drug-related). Both the patients discontinued the 
treatment due to respective events. None of the patient required any dose adjustments or 
interruptions/delay. 
QT prolongation 
The SMQ (broad) “Torsade de pointes/QT prolongation” was used to identify and define the frequency of QT 
prolongation events. 
QT prolongation AEs (primarily ECG QT prolonged) were reported in 14 patients (12.2%). Majority of these 
AEs were of grade 1/2 severity, and grade 3/4 events were reported in two patients (1.7%). The QT 
prolongation AEs in 13 patients (11.3%) were suspected to be drug-related by the Investigator. Serious 
events were reported in two patients (1.7%). AE requiring dose adjustments or interruptions was reported 
in two patients. No patient discontinued treatment due to QT prolongation AEs. No grade 4 QT prolongation 
or torsade de pointes case were reported; no patients with AE of QT prolongation (preferred term) had 
syncope/loss of consciousness. 
The reported QT prolongation AEs by PT were ECG QT prolonged (13 patients; 11.3%, regardless of 
correction method) and loss of consciousness (one patient; 0.9%). Two patients had grade 3/4 QT 
prolongation AEs which were also reported as SAEs, in one of these patients the event was suspected to be 
study drug-related. 
ECG interval abnormalities 
Previous studies have shown that QTcB and QTcF did not appropriately correct QT for heart rate in ceritinib 
studies. Thus, QTcP correction (based on a population linear regression methodology) is considered the most 
appropriate correction to characterize the effect of ceritinib on the QT interval. Evaluable patients for 
analyses based on changes from baseline are those with a baseline ECG and at least one post-baseline ECG. 
QTcP/QTcF values >480 ms and >500 ms were observed in four patients (3.5%) and one patient (0.9%), 
respectively (Table 33). 
One patient (0.9%) had a QTcP/QTcF interval >500 ms in the ceritinib group.  
Six (5.5%) patients in the ceritinib group had a decrease in the heart rate (HR) of >25% from baseline and 
to <50 beats per minute (Table 33).

Table  33:  Number  and  percentage  of  patients  with  notable  ECG  values  by  treatment  group 
(Safety set) 
Change in QTc versus ceritinib PK concentration 
Changes from baseline in heart rate corrected QT interval were plotted against the time-matched ceritinib 
plasma concentrations, and the relationship was assessed using a linear mixed effects model. 
Based on 86 patients, the PK/PD analysis of the QTcP data, at median steady-state Cmin (1090.0 ng/mL) 
suggested a concentration-dependent QTcP interval prolongation with an estimated 14.0 ms mean QTcP 
increase from baseline, with the upper bound of the 2-sided 90% CI for mean QTcP change from baseline 
<20 ms. 
Bradycardia 
The Novartis MedDRA query (broad) “Bradyarrhythmias and bradycardia” was used to identify and define 
the frequency of bradycardia events. This query includes the PT of “QT prolongation” which has also been 
included in the search for AESI of QT prolongation mentioned above. 
Bradycardia events category were reported in 17 patients (14.8%) ceritinib group. Majority of these AEs 
were of grade 1/2 severity, and grade 3/4 events were reported in one patient (0.9%). These included the 
AE of ECG QT prolonged reported in 13 patients (11.3%) which has also been reported under QT 
prolongation AESI category. 
Only three patients in the ceritinib group had actual AE of bradycardia, none of which was grade 3/4 or 
serious or led to study treatment discontinuation; two of these three cases were suspected to be study 
drug-related. 
Based on ECG data, there were six (5.5%) patients in the ceritinib group having a decrease in the heart rate 
(HR) more than 25% and to less than 50 beats per minute compared to baseline.

Hyperglycaemia 
The SMQ (narrow) “Hyperglycaemia/new onset diabetes mellitus” was used to identify and define the 
frequency of hyperglycaemia events. Additional PTs related to hyperglycaemia laboratory values were used 
to identify the AESI hyperglycaemia. 
Hyperglycaemia AEs were reported in 10 patients (8.7%), which included events of hyperglycaemia in eight 
patients (7.0%) and diabetes mellitus in two patients (1.7%). Six patients (5.2%) had grade 3/4 
hyperglycaemia AEs. Five of the six patients with grade 3/4 hyperglycaemia had confounding factors 
(concomitant medications and/or pre-existing/newly occurring disease conditions). Five patients had brain 
metastasis at baseline, two patients developed brain metastasis during the study, five patients had 
concomitant use steroids during the study and one patient [A2303-1254-003] had a single isolated 
increased glucose value where it is not clear if the sample was taken fasted or fed (no other AEs reported). 
Additionally three patients had elevated fasting plasma glucose at baseline. Additionally three patients had 
elevated fasting plasma glucose at baseline. No action was taken with study treatment except in one patient 
and five patients received anti-hyperglycaemic agents for treatment. None of the hyperglycaemia AEs were 
suspected to be drug-related by the Investigator. The event was considered serious in one patient (0.9%). 
None of the patient discontinued treatment due to hyperglycaemia AEs. 
One patient (0.9%) (A2303-1201-002) in the ceritinib group had grade 3 hyperglycaemia (Day 287) which 
was serious. This event was not suspected to be drug-related by the Investigator, and no action was taken 
with study drug. The patient discontinued the study due to disease progression on Day 451, and the patient 
had received last dose of ceritinib at Day 441. 
Blood glucose laboratory abnormalities 
Based on the laboratory parameters, of the 115 patients treated with ceritinib the majority of patients (96 
patients, 83.5%) had normal blood glucose at baseline (grade 0). Post-baseline, 57 patients (49.6%) had 
increased blood glucose, of which 40 patients (34.8%), six patients (5.2%), and 11 patients (9.6%) had 
grade 1, grade 2, and grade 3 hyperglycaemia respectively. Of the 11 patients who worsened to grade 3 in 
the ceritinib group; eight, two, and one patient worsened from baseline grade 0, 1, and 2, respectively. No 
patient had grade 4 increase in glucose. 
In the chemotherapy group, the majority (77 patients, 68.1%) of patients had normal blood glucose at 
baseline. Similar to the ceritinib group, 52 patients (46.0%) had hyperglycaemia of any grade post-baseline, 
of which 40 patients (35.4%), five patients (4.4%), six patients (5.3%), and one patient (0.9%) had grade 
1, 2, 3, 4 hyperglycaemia respectively. 
Analysis of median/mean blood glucose levels at screening and during the course of the study further did not 
show any increase with start of ceritinib treatment or later during the study. Blood glucose levels in the 
ceritinib group were also not higher compared to the chemotherapy group. 
Gastrointestinal toxicity 
The PTs used to identify and define the frequency of GI toxicity events were ‘Diarrhoea’, ‘Nausea’, and 
‘Vomiting’. 
Gastrointestinal AEs were reported in 107 patients (93.0%) in the ceritinib group, with grade 3/4 AEs 
reported in 15 patients (13.0%). These events were suspected to be drug-related in 99 patients (86.1%). 
The events required dose adjustment or interruption/delay in 40 patients (34.8%), and one patient (0.9%) 
in the discontinued treatment due to grade 3 vomiting (not suspected to be related to ceritinib). 
GI toxicity SAEs were reported in eight patients (7.0%). In six patients the GI toxicity SAEs had resolved, 
one patient it was not resolved at the time of the report, and one patient [A2303- 1356-001] died due to 
Assessment report  
EMA/367341/2017 
Page 60/94 
 
  
  
disease progression with the event (vomiting, not related to study drug) ongoing at the time of death. In 
seven patients the GI toxicity SAEs were considered suspected to be study drug-related. 
Pancreatitis 
The Novartis MedDRA Query (broad) ‘Acute pancreatitis (excl. non-specific symptoms)’ was used to identify 
and define the frequency of pancreatitis events. This query comprises the SMQ (narrow) ‘Acute Pancreatitis’ 
and the PTs related to pancreatic enzyme abnormalities including lipase and amylase increase. 
Pancreatitis AEs were reported in seven patients (6.1%) in ceritinib, with grade 3/4 AEs reported in five 
patients (4.3%). The AEs reported were amylase increased in all seven patients (6.1%). No AEs with PT of 
“pancreatitis” was reported. In four patients (3.5%) the pancreatitis AEs were suspected to be study 
drug-related. Two patients (1.7%) required dose adjustments or interruptions/delay. None of the 
pancreatitis AEs were serious or led to treatment discontinuation. 
None of the seven cases in the ceritinib group are suggestive of (acute) pancreatitis based on medical 
review; 6/7 patients had brain metastasis at baseline of which four received brain radiotherapy around the 
event; in addition, 2/7 patients had grade 3 and 2/7 patients had grade 2 amylase elevation at baseline, 
respectively. 
Pancreatitis is an important identified risk in the current risk management plan (RMP) and has been included 
in the Section “Special warnings and precautions for use” and in the ADR Table of the current SmPC. Patients 
should be monitored for lipase and amylase elevations prior to the start of the treatment with ceritinib, and 
periodically thereafter as clinically indicated. 
Amylase/lipase laboratory abnormalities 
Based on the laboratory parameters, of the 115 patients treated with ceritinib the majority of patients (98 
patients, 85.2%) had normal amylase (grade 0) at baseline. Post-baseline, 43 patients (37.4%) had 
amylase increase of any grade, of which 29 patients (25.2%), eight patients (7.0%), three patients (2.6%) 
and three patients (2.6%) had grade 1, grade 2, grade 3, and 4 amylase increase, respectively. Of note, 17 
patients (14.8%) had elevated amylase levels already at baseline; in particular, one out of the three grade 
3 cases had grade 2 amylase increase at baseline and two had normal amylase (grade 0) at baseline, and 
two out of the three grade 4 cases had grade 3 amylase increase at baseline and one had normal amylase 
(grade 0) at baseline. 
Lipase values were available for few patients only since this parameter was not routinely collected as part of 
the initial protocol. Of the 115 patients treated with ceritinib, majority of the patients (110 patients, 95.7%) 
had missing values and five patients (4.3%) had grade 0 lipase at baseline. Post-baseline, three (2.6%) 
patients had lipase elevations of any grade, of which two patients had grade 1 lipase elevations and one 
patient had grade 2 lipase elevation and no patients had grade 3 or 4 elevations. 
AEs and laboratory abnormalities associated with creatinine increase and renal function 
Twenty-two (19.1%) patients in the ceritinib vs. none in the chemotherapy group had creatinine elevations 
based on AEs. All were grade 1 or 2 in severity, none were reported as SAEs or led to study drug 
discontinuation, and 19/22 were considered study drug-related as per the Investigator. Most of the patients 
had GI toxicity (18/22 diarrhea, 9/22 vomiting) preceding and/or around the event as possible contributing 
factor, however, none of these patients had an AE of dehydration. Furthermore, 9/22 patients had grade 1 
creatinine increase, and 1/22 patients had grade 2 creatinine increases at baseline as per laboratory data. 
Based on laboratory assessments, 91 patients (79.1%) had creatinine increase of any grade post-baseline, 
of which 37 patients (32.2%) and 54 patients (47.0%) had grade 1 and grade 2 creatinine increase, 
respectively. There were no grade 3 and 4 cases of creatinine increase. In the chemotherapy group, 
Assessment report  
EMA/367341/2017 
Page 61/94 
 
  
  
post-baseline 23 patients (20.3%) had creatinine increase of any grade, of which 21 patients (18.6%) had 
grade 1 and two patients (1.8%) had grade 2 postbaseline creatinine increase. 
Analysis of mean/median blood creatinine levels at screening and during the course of the study showed an 
early increase after start of ceritinib (i.e. Day 15) with steady levels thereafter without further accumulation, 
and recovery upon treatment discontinuation. In contrast, levels of BUN did not increase. 
Under the SOC of “renal and urinary disorders”, AEs were reported in 10 patients (8.7%) in the ceritinib 
group. The AEs by preferred term included: dysuria (n=3), acute kidney injury (n=1), chromaturia (n=1), 
chronic kidney disease (n=1), nocturia (n=1), polyuria (n=1), renal failure (n=1), renal impairment (n=1), 
and urinary bladder rupture (n=1). In 2/10 patients the event was grade 3 (chronic kidney disease and 
urinary bladder rupture); there were no Grade 4 events. One patient [A2303-1254-003] had urinary bladder 
rupture on Day 389 which reported as SAE (not related to study drug). Only one patient required study drug 
adjustment, and three patients required study drug interruption. None of the events led to study drug 
discontinuation. 
In addition to the 22 patients with blood creatinine increase reported under the SOC of “Investigations”, 
creatinine renal clearance decreased was reported in three patients of which one patient had grade 3 event 
(A2303-1254-001; patient had grade 2 creatinine clearance decrease reported prior to start of study drug). 
All three events were suspected to be study drug related. None of the events were SAEs, lead to study drug 
discontinuation or required dose adjustment/ interruption. No patients died due to creatinine increased or 
renal function AEs while on ceritinib. 
Renal impairment related AEs in the ceritinib treated patients showed an increased frequency of AEs with the 
PT of creatinine increased and hyper-creatininemia (any grade: 30.0% mild, 44.4% moderate vs 3.5% 
normal renal function). Elevations of creatinine were transient and reversible upon treatment 
discontinuation. 
There were no grade 3/4 events of acute kidney injury, renal failure or renal impairment reported in the 
ceritinib group in Study A2303. 
A slightly higher frequency of QT prolongation AEs was found among patients with mild renal impairment 
compared to patients with normal renal function (17.5% mild and 8.8% normal respectively). None of these 
events were grade 3/4, and no SAEs occurred. 
Testosterone and Gonadotropin level changes 
Testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and sex hormone-binding 
globulin (SHBG) were measured in male patients to assess potential impact of ceritinib on male hormone 
levels. 
Analysis of total testosterone (free and bound), free testosterone index, LH, FSH and SHBG did not show 
significant changes between baseline and post-baseline measurement (i.e. D15), and was also similar 
between the ceritinib and chemotherapy group. 
Clinical laboratory evaluations 
Laboratory assessments in the Study A2303 consisted of monitoring of haematology, biochemistry 
(including liver laboratory tests). Data from all sources (central and local laboratories) were combined. 
Haematology 
The grade 3/4 haematology laboratory abnormalities were generally reported more frequently in 
chemotherapy-treated patients compared to ceritinib. 
In the ceritinib group, the haematological abnormalities were predominantly grade 1 or 2, the grade 3/4 
abnormalities were not reported in more than two patients (1.7%), except for decreased lymphocytes. 
Assessment report  
EMA/367341/2017 
Page 62/94 
 
  
  
Grade 3 lymphopenia was observed in 17.4% patients in the ceritinib group vs. 23.0% in the chemotherapy 
group. Only one patient (0.9%) in the ceritinib group had grade 4 haematological abnormality (decreased 
lymphocytes) (Table 34). The following grade 3 and 4 abnormalities were observed in the ceritinib group: 
two patients (1.7%) had grade 3 absolute neutrophils decreased (one patient each worsened from grade 0 
and grade 2), one patient (0.9%) each had grade 3 decreased haemoglobin (worsened from grade 0), 
thrombocytopenia (worsened from grade 0) and decreased WBCs (worsened from grade 1) during the study 
(no grade 4). Grade 3 absolute lymphocytes decrease was observed in 20 patients (17.4%) (eight, four, and 
seven patients worsened from grade 0, 1, and 2 respectively, and one patient had grade 3 abnormality at 
baseline), and one patient had grade 4 absolute lymphocytes decrease (worsened from grade 1). 
Table 34: Haematology worst post-baseline laboratory value based on CTC grade by treatment 
group (Safety set) 
Clinical chemistry 
Grade 3/4 liver parameter abnormalities (elevated ALT, AST, ALP, and GGT) were higher in the ceritinib 
group as compared to the chemotherapy group (Table 35); however, bilirubin increase was noted in three 
patients (2.6%) and there were no Hy’s law cases. The frequency hyperglycaemia post-baseline, was similar 
in ceritinib (49.6%) and chemotherapy group (46.0%). Eleven (9.6%) vs. seven (6.2%) patients had grade 
3/4 glucose increase in the ceritinib and chemotherapy group, respectively; most of these cases were 
confounded by concomitant medications (i.e. steroids) and/or underlying disease conditions. Post-baseline, 
although creatinine increase was noted in 91 patients (79.1%), none of the patient had grade 3/4 
elevations, the creatinine increase was generally not associated with clinical events, and was reversible upon 
treatment discontinuation.

Table 35: Biochemistry shift table based on CTC grade by treatment group (Safety set) 
Based on laboratory data review, 12/26 (47.2%) and 15/26 (57.7%) of patients with an event of ALP and 
GGT increased, respectively, had an abnormal baseline value of the corresponding laboratory parameter 
prior to treatment start with ceritinib. The event of ALP increased resolved in 18/26 (69.2%) patients and 
GGT increased in 16/26 patients (61.5%). None of the AEs were SAEs, and no study drug discontinuations 
occurred due specifically to ALP or GGT increase, furthermore, generally do not require specific management 
guidelines. No association was found with bilirubin increase, and the abnormalities were reversible with no 
evidence for prolonged or severe cholestatic injury despite treatment continuation. 
Based on a comprehensive review of the available safety information from Study A2303, “blood ALP 
increased” has been added as a new term to the existing ADR “Liver laboratory test abnormalities”. 
Furthermore, in the update SmPC, “ALP increased” has been identified as a new ADR and has been proposed 
to be added to Table 2 of Section 4.8 “Undesirable effects” of the SmPC under the term “Liver laboratory test 
abnormalities” in the system organ class (SOC) “Investigations”. “GGT increased” was already included in 
Table 2 of the SmPC under the same term and SOC at the time of the initial Marketing Authorization 
Application. Increases in ALP and GGT are managed in the context of hepatotoxicity and no additional 
guidance is needed in the SmPC.

Vital signs, physical findings, and other observations related to safety 
Vital signs 
Vital sign assessments were performed in order to characterize basic body function. The parameters 
collected were weight (kg), body temperature (°C), pulse rate (beats per minute), systolic and diastolic 
blood pressure (mmHg), and respiration rate (breaths per minute). 
Descriptive statistics were tabulated for baseline and change from baseline to worst post-baseline value for 
each vital sign measurement. Further, vital signs shift table based on clinically notable values at baseline 
and worst post-baseline were produced. 
Changes in vital signs, weight, and physical examination findings that were considered abnormal by the 
Investigator were reported as AEs. 
Most of the vital signs did not change notably from baseline, with the exception of weight and blood 
pressure. 
•  Weight: In the ceritinib group, of the 115 patients with a normal weight at baseline, 34 patients (29.6%) 
had a post-baseline decrease in weight of ≥ 10% compared to baseline, and six patients (5.2%) had a 
post-baseline increase in weight of ≥ 10%. 18.3% of patients was suspected to be related to study 
treatment by the Investigator and the events were resolved in 38.2% of patients. No SAEs have been 
described. Based on body weight measurements, the mean highest change (standard deviation [SD]) in 
weight post-baseline was 0.5 kg (4.1) and the mean lowest change (SD) was −5.5 kg (4.2) in the 
ceritinib group. More than one third of patients recovered from the initial event of weight decrease. In the 
chemotherapy group, of the 113 patients with a normal weight at baseline, two patients (1.8%) had a 
post-baseline decrease in weight of ≥ 10% compared to baseline and four patients (3.5%) had a 
post-baseline increase in weight of ≥ 10%.  
 “Weight decreased” was included in section 4.8, Table 2 of the SmPC. 
•  Sitting systolic blood pressure: In the ceritinib group, of the 110 patients with a normal sitting 
systolic blood pressure (BP) at baseline, 11 patients (10.0%) had a post-baseline decrease in systolic BP 
to ≤ 90 mmHg and a decrease of ≥ 20 mmHg compared to baseline, and eight patients (7.3%) had a 
post-baseline increase in systolic BP to ≥ 160 mmHg and an increase of 20 mmHg compared to baseline. 
In the chemotherapy group, of the 112 patients with a normal sitting systolic BP at baseline, one patient 
(0.9%) had a postbaseline decrease in systolic BP to ≤ 90 mmHg and a decrease of ≥ 20 mmHg 
compared to baseline, and three patients (2.7%) had a post-baseline increase in systolic BP to ≥ 160 
mmHg and an increase of 20 mmHg compared to baseline. The mean change (SD) in sitting systolic BP 
from baseline for the worst post-baseline value was 12.8 mm Hg (15.77). 
•  Sitting diastolic blood pressure: In the ceritinib group, of the 111 patients with a normal sitting 
diastolic BP at baseline, eight patients each (7.2%) had notable post-baseline decrease (diastolic BP of ≤ 
50 mmHg and decrease of ≥ 15 mmHg compared to baseline) and increase (diastolic BP of ≥ 100 mmHg 
and increase of ≥ 15 mmHg compared to baseline) relative to baseline. In the chemotherapy group, of 
the 112 patients with a normal sitting diastolic BP at baseline, two patient (1.8%) had a post-baseline 
decrease in diastolic BP to ≤ 50 mmHg and decrease of ≥ 15 mmHg compared to baseline -, and five 
patients (4.5%) had a post-baseline increase in diastolic BP to ≥ 100 mmHg and increase of ≥ 15 mmHg 
compared to baseline. The mean change (SD) in sitting diastolic BP from baseline for the worst 
post-baseline value was 9.9 mmHg (9.27). 
Electrocardiograms 
The ECG data was analyzed based on central laboratory reported results. 
QTcP is considered the most appropriate correction to characterize effect of ceritinib on the QT internal.

In the ceritinib group, of 114 patients (99.1%) with QTcP ≤ 450 ms at baseline, 32 patients (28.1%), three 
patients (2.6%), and one patient (0.9%) were noted with post-baseline QTcP value of >450-480 ms, 
>480-500 ms, and >500 ms, respectively. One of the three patients with >480-500 ms post-baseline 
already had an elevated QTcP of 463.4 ms at baseline. 
In the chemotherapy group, of 111 patients with QTcP ≤ 450 ms at baseline,10 patients (9.0%) and one 
patient (0.9%) were noted with post-baseline QTcP values of >450-480 ms, and >480-500 ms, respectively. 
Safety in special groups and situations 
Analyses of AEs by region, age, gender, race, presence or absence of brain metastases, and  WHO PS (0 vs. 
≥ 1) showed patterns that were generally consistent with those of the overall population, and no relevant 
clinically meaningful differences were observed. 
In Study A2303, the median age of patients randomized to the ceritinib group was 54 years (range: 30 to 77 
years; n=89 <65 years, n=26 ≥ 65 years). Among the patients ≥ 65 years, two patients were ≥ 75 -84 
years and none were ≥ 85 years old. In the subgroup analysis of safety by age (<65 years vs. ≥ 65 years) 
that was performed in Study A2303, the safety profile of patients ≥ 65 years was generally consistent with 
that of the overall population, and did not reveal any relevant clinically meaningful differences (≥ 10%). The 
incidence of most AESIs was similar between the two age groups (<65 years vs. ≥ 65 years) except for GI 
toxicity (96.6% vs. 80.8%) and hepatotoxicity (56.2% vs. 42.3%), where the incidence was higher in 
patients <65 years compared to patients ≥ 65 years.  
The incidence of AESIs were generally similar across the different subgroups, with few differences (>10%) 
observed in the frequency of occurrence of the certain AESIs as mentioned below (Table 36). As stated 
above these results should be interpreted with caution due to the small size of the various subgroups and the 
limited number of patients with certain AESIs (e.g. bradycardia, QT prolongation). 
The incidence of most AESIs was similar across regions except for bradycardia events (30.8% vs. 8.8%) and 
QTc prolongation (23.1% vs 7.5%), where the incidence of these events was higher in the patients from Asia 
pacific compared to Europe. North America region is excluded from this comparison as the sample size was 
very small (n=9). 
Of note, bradycardia AESI also includes QT prolongation which was the most common AE in this category; 
the same patients are also included in the QT prolongation AESI; the number of patients with actual 
bradycardia was low. 
The incidence of most AESIs was similar between age groups except for GI toxicity (96.6% vs 80.8%) and 
hepatotoxicity (56.2% vs 42.3%) where the incidence was higher in patients <65 years compared to 
patients ≥ 65 years of age. 
The incidence of most AESIs was similar for both males and females, although differences were apparent in 
the incidences of bradycardia events (8.5% vs 19.1%). 
Analyses of AESIs by race showed that incidences of hepatotoxicity (66.7% vs 46.9%), bradycardia (30.0% 
vs 8.6%), and QTc prolongation (20.0% vs 8.6%) events were higher in Asians vs. Caucasian. 
There were generally no differences in the incidences of AESIs with respect to ECOG status of 0 vs. ≥ 1, 
except for bradycardia events (21.4% vs. 8.5%) and QTc prolongation (17.9% vs. 6.8%) which were more 
frequent in patients with ECOG status 0. 
There was no difference in the incidence of AESIs in patients with or without brain metastasis at screening.

Table 36: AESIs in ceritinib treatment group by subgroups (Safety set) 
No specific analyses were conducted to evaluate the use of other drugs, tobacco, alcohol on the tolerability 
and safety of ceritinib. 
Safety in the subgroup of patients who cross-over to ceritinib in Study A2303 
Patients randomized to the chemotherapy group were allowed to cross-over to receive ceritinib therapy in 
the extension-treatment phase only after BIRC-confirmed RECIST- defined disease progression. 
Seventy-five patients from the chemotherapy group crossed over to ceritinib, and entered the 
extension-treatment. One of these 75 patients died before starting the first dose of ceritinib in the 
extension-treatment phase. At the time of the data cut-off, 28/75 patients (37.3%) in the 
extension-treatment phase were still ongoing. Forty-seven of the 75 patients discontinued the 
extension-treatment phase, and the primary reasons for discontinuation were disease progression (24 
patients) (Table 1-3). 
The median duration of exposure was 6.1 weeks (min-max: 3.0 to 59.9 weeks) and 28 patients (37.8%) 
were exposed to ceritinib 750 mg for a period of ≥ 12 weeks in the extensiontreatment phase. 
In the extension-treatment phase, the pattern in incidence of the various AE categories were generally 
consistent with those observed during the treatment phase of the study, with numerical differences (<10%) 
when compared to treatment phase in all the AE categories, except for AEs requiring dose interruption/delay 
Assessment report  
EMA/367341/2017 
Page 67/94 
 
  
  
 
which were reported higher during the treatment phase (73.0% vs. 56.8% in the extension-treatment 
phase) (Table 37, Table 21). 
Sixteen patients died on-treatment in the extension-treatment phase. The majority of the ontreatment 
deaths (11/16) were attributed to disease progression, and cause of death for the remaining five deaths 
were reported as “other causes”, which were consistent with what would be expected in a population with 
NSCLC and with other comorbid conditions. The five deaths which were reported due to “other” causes were 
due: renal failure, intestinal perforation, hyperglycemia, pulmonary embolism, and sudden death. Of these 
five deaths, one death due to pulmonary embolism was suspected to be study drug-related by the 
Investigator. 
Table 37: Overall summary of AEs (Cross-over analysis set) 
Overall, the pattern of AEs was also consistent with that observed in the treatment phase, although 
individual frequencies are slightly lower, which could be due to the shorter median duration of exposure of 
ceritinib in the extension-treatment phase (6.1 vs. 30.3 weeks in treatment phase). 
The most frequently observed AEs (in >20% of patients) (regardless of study drug relationship) in the 
extension-treatment phase were: diarrhea (71.6%), nausea (56.8%), vomiting (47.3%), ALT increased 
(29.7%), decreased appetite (27.0%), AST increased (25.7%), blood creatinine increased (24.3%), 
abdominal pain (23.0%), fatigue and constipation (each 21.6%), and GGT increased (20.3%) (Table 38). 
The most frequently observed grade 3/4 AEs (in >10% of patients) (regardless of study drug relationship) 
in the extension-treatment phase were: ALT increased (17.6%), nausea, AST increased, and GGT increased 
(10.8% each) (Table 38). 
No Hy’s law case was observed in the extension-treatment phase (i.e. concurrent AT >3xULN and TBILI 
>2xULN, and ALP <2xULN).

Drug interactions 
Potential for drug-drug interaction is adequately reflected in the label. 
Avoid co-administration of ceritinib with strong CYP3A inhibitors and inducers. If concomitant use with 
strong CYP3A inhibitors is unavoidable, reduce the ceritinib dose by approximately one-third, rounded to the 
nearest multiple of the 150 mg dosage strength. Avoid co-administration of ceritinib with CYP3A and CYP2C9 
substrates with narrow therapeutic indices. Exercise caution with concomitant use of P-gp inhibitors and 
inducers.Exercise caution with concomitant use of CYP2A6 and CYP2E1 substrates. 
Drug-food/drink interactions 
The bioavailability of ceritinib is increased in the presence of food depending on the fat content in the meal. 
Ceritinib should be taken on an empty stomach. No food should be eaten for at least two hours before and 
two hours after the dose of ZYKADIA is taken. 
Patients should be instructed to avoid grapefruit or grapefruit juice as they may inhibit CYP3A in the gut wall 
and may increase the bioavailability of ceritinib.

Use in pregnancy and lactation 
Because of the potential risks to the human fetus, women of child-bearing potential were advised to avoid 
becoming pregnant and to use highly-effective contraception during treatment and up to 3 months following 
treatment discontinuation. In case pregnancy occurs, risk benefit evaluations must be carried out on an 
individual basis with careful counselling regarding potential risk to the fetus. 
Mothers should avoid breast-feeding while receiving ceritinib, as it is not known whether ceritinib is excreted 
in milk. The potential for ceritinib to cause infertility in male and female patients is unknown. 
Overdose 
No new information about overdose has been generated in support of this application; recommendations are 
described in the approved prescribing information. 
Drug abuse 
No new information about abuse/dependence potential has been generated in support of this application. 
There is no known potential for abuse of ceritinib and no abuse studies have been performed. 
Withdrawal and rebound 
No studies have been conducted to assess withdrawal and rebound effects of ceritinib. 
Effects on ability to drive or operate machinery or impairment of mental ability 
No studies have been performed on the effects of ceritinib on the ability to drive or operate machinery. 
Nevertheless, patients who receive ceritinib could experience fatigue and should drive and operate 
machinery with caution. 
Post-marketing data 
Relevant publications containing important new safety information published are regularly retrieved from 
the three publicly accessible, bibliographic databases Medline, Embase and Biosis Previews or by full text 
screenings in subscribed medical journals. The search criteria was inclusive of pregnancy outcomes 
(including termination) with no adverse outcomes, use in pediatric populations, compassionate supply, 
named patient use, lack of efficacy, asymptomatic overdose, abuse or misuse, medication error where no 
AEs occurred, or “near misses” and important non-clinical safety results. The search criteria used were 
LDK378, ceritinib, ALK inhibitor, anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitor, and various selective ALK inhibitors. 
With the exclusion of publications describing individual case reports which have been included in PSURs, 
there were no new and significant safety findings published in the peerreviewed scientific literature or made 
available as unpublished manuscripts in PSUR 2, 3 and 4 and from 29 April 2016 to 10 August 2016. 
Data from Novartis global pharmacovigilance safety database 
Cumulative listings of SAE and death reports that were reported to the Novartis global pharmacovigilance 
database (ARGUS) from 23 ongoing Novartis-sponsored studies up to 10-Aug-2016. The evaluation of the 
information received until 10-Aug-2016 in 23 Novartis ongoing studies did not reveal any new safety 
concern or a change in frequency or severity, and does not suggest an update to the characterization of the 
risks is needed. It did not reveal any new relevant data impacting on the positive benefit/risk balance of 
Zykadia. The safety data is consistent with the known safety profile of ceritinib. 
No untoward effects have been reported in ongoing trials that would materially alter the established safety 
profile of ceritinib.

Post-marketing surveillance 
Ceritinib was granted accelerated approval in USA under the trade name of Zykadia on 29-Apr-2014 for the 
treatment of patients with ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC who have progressed on or are intolerant to 
crizotinib. In EU, Zykadia was granted conditional marketing authorization on 06-May-2015 for the 
treatment of adult patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC previously treated with crizotinib. Meanwhile, 
it has been approved in more than 50 countries including Switzerland, Japan, and Canada. 
Routine pharmacovigilance activities, including regular targeted follow-up, are continuously performed by 
Novartis. If new safety data emerge providing evidence of increased severity, specificity, or frequency of a 
safety event, Health Authorities will be notified and the Risk Management/Risk Minimization Plan reviewed 
and updated. 
An estimate of patient exposure was based on worldwide sales volume in kilogram (kg) of active substance 
sold cumulatively, and on the Defined Daily Dose of 750 mg. The cumulative exposure since the 
International Birth Date (IBD, 29-Apr-2014) is estimated to be approximately 1214 patient-treatment-year 
(28-April-2016). 
The post-marketing experience with ceritinib has been reviewed on an ongoing basis and the results 
available in Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs). No new information has emerged based on 
post-marketing usage of Zykadia that would substantially alter the known safety profile of ceritinib. The 
overall benefit-risk balance of ceritinib for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic ALK 
positive NSCLC remains positive. 
4.3.3.  Discussion 
The MAH has submitted the confirmatory Study A2303. This was a Phase III, multi-center, randomized, 
open-label study of ceritinib in patients with ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC who have progressed or are 
intolerant to crizotinib.  
The median duration of exposure to chemotherapy was 6.3 weeks compared to 30.3 weeks with ceritinib. 
The median duration of exposure was 14.1 weeks and 6.1 weeks for patients who took pemetrexed and 
docetaxel, respectively. 
AEs: The most frequently reported AEs (in ≥ 20% of patients) of any grade in the ceritinib group were 
diarrhea (72.2%), nausea (66.1%), vomiting (52.2%), ALT increased (42.6%), decreased appetite 
(41.7%), AST increased (36.5%), weight decreased (29.6%), fatigue (27.0%), asthenia (22.6%), ALP 
increased (22.6%), GGT increased (22.6%), abdominal pain (21.7%), and back pain (21.7%). These AEs 
are consistent with the known safety profiles of ceritinib, and can be effectively managed dose 
reduction/interruption and/or use of concomitant medication. 
Based on body weight measurements, the mean highest change (standard deviation [SD]) in weight 
post-baseline was 0.5 kg (4.1) and the mean lowest change (SD) was −5.5 kg (4.2) in the ceritinib group. 
More than one third of patients recovered from the initial event of weight decrease.“Weight decreased” was 
included in section 4.8, Table 2 of the SmPC. 
AEs suspected to be drug-related: The most frequently (in ≥ 20% of patients) reported AEs of any grade 
suspected to be related to study drug included diarrhea (63.5%), nausea (60.9%), vomiting (47.8%), ALT 
increased (41.7%), AST increased (35.7%), and decreased appetite (33.0%).in the ceritinib group, and 
fatigue (23.9%) in the chemotherapy group. 
AESI: Hepatotoxicity, ILD/pneumonitis, QT prolongation, hyperglycemia, bradycardia, GI toxicity and 
pancreatitis have been identified as AESIs for ceritinib, and are known to occur with other tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors. These were manageable with dose adjustments and/or dose interruptions (with or without use of 
Assessment report  
EMA/367341/2017

concomitant medication). Five patients in the ceritinib group discontinued study treatment due to AESIs. No 
Hy’s law cases and none of the study drug-related AESIs were the primary cause of death. No deaths due to 
AESIs occurred in Study A2303. 
Gastrointestinal toxicity AEs, although occurred the most frequently (reported in 93.0% of patients) in the 
ceritinib group. Majority of these events were grade 1 or 2. Grade 3/4 GI AEs were reported in 13.0% of 
patients. Majority of GI events were clinically managed by dose adjustment or interruption/delay, and/or 
concomitant medications as appropriate. Only one patient in the ceritinib group discontinued due to GI 
toxicity (grade 3 vomiting, not considered to be study drug-related as per Investigator assessment). 
Hepatotoxicity AEs were reported in 53.0% of patients, with grade 3/4 reported in 38.3% of patient, and 
consisted mostly of isolated, transient and reversible increases of transaminases without clinical symptoms 
that were manageable with dose adjustment and/or dose interruptions. None of the patient presented with 
other concurrent observations related to impaired liver function. Only one patient reported a hepatotoxicity 
SAE (not related to study drug), and only two patients discontinued study treatment. No cases of Hy’s law 
were reported and no patient with concurrent transaminase and bilirubin increase. Two patients in the 
ceritinib group discontinued treatment due to these events (increased ALT/AST). Based on biochemistry 
data, overall increases in AT >3 x ULN (grade 2), AT >5 x ULN (grade 3), AT >20 x ULN (grade 4) were seen 
in 48.7%, 26.1%, and 1.7% of patients ceritinib group. Regular monitoring of transaminase levels allows 
early intervention (i.e. dose adjustments or interruptions/delay) for effective management of the event. 
Based on laboratory data review, 12/26 (47.2%) and 15/26 (57.7%) of patients with an event of ALP and 
GGT increased, respectively, had an abnormal baseline value of the corresponding laboratory parameter 
prior to treatment start with ceritinib. The event of ALP increased resolved in 18/26 (69.2%) patients and 
GGT increased in 16/26 patients (61.5%). None of the AEs were SAEs, and no study drug discontinuations 
occurred due specifically to ALP or GGT increase, furthermore, generally do not require specific management 
guidelines. No association was found with bilirubin increase, and the abnormalities were reversible with no 
evidence for prolonged or severe cholestatic injury despite treatment continuation. 
Based on a comprehensive review of the available safety information from Study A2303, “blood ALP 
increased” has been added as a new term to the existing ADR “Liver laboratory test abnormalities”. 
Furthermore, in the update SmPC, “ALP increased” has been identified as a new ADR and has been proposed 
to be added to Table 2 of Section 4.8 “Undesirable effects” of the SmPC under the term “Liver laboratory test 
abnormalities” in the system organ class (SOC) “Investigations”. “GGT increased” was already included in 
Table 2 of the SmPC under the same term and SOC at the time of the initial Marketing Authorization 
Application. Increases in ALP and GGT are managed in the context of hepatotoxicity and no additional 
guidance is needed in the SmPC. 
The review of the overall safety profile of ceritinib in patients with mild hepatic impairment at baseline versus 
patients with normal hepatic function at baseline did not reveal any clinically relevant differences or new 
safety concerns, and is consistent with the known safety profile of ceritinib. No patients with 
moderate/severe hepatic impairment at baseline were enrolled into Study A2303. 
The interpretation of the slightly higher incidence of on-treatment deaths in ceritinib treated patients with 
mild hepatic impairment at baseline compared to patients with normal hepatic function at baseline is limited 
due to the small subgroup size and limited number of patients with an event. All deaths were due to study 
indication. 
Ceritinib is known to have a relevant QT prolonging effect. QT prolongation suspected to be related to 
ceritinib was observed in 11.3% patients. Only one patient reported a grade 3 AE of QT prolongation 
(confounded by grade 4 hypokalemia), and only one patient had QTcP prolongation > 500 msec based on 
ECG, which was not reported as an SAE. There were no cases of torsade de pointes or grade 4 AEs. 
No case of clinically relevant consequences has been reported. None of the QT prolongation AEs led to study 
Assessment report  
EMA/367341/2017 
Page 73/94 
 
  
  
drug discontinuation. There were no grade 4 QT prolongation AEs or Torsade de points, and no patients with 
AE of QT prolongation (preferred term) had syncope/loss of consciousness in Study A2303. No deaths 
associated with QT prolongation were reported.  
Bradycardia AEs were reported in 17 patients (14.8%) in ceritinib group. These included the AE of ECG QT 
prolonged in 11.3% of patients (same as presented in QT prolongation category). Only three patients in the 
ceritinib group had actual AE of bradycardia, none of which was grade 3/4 or serious or was leading to study 
treatment discontinuation; one of these three cases was suspected to be study drug-related. 
ILD/pneumonitis AEs were low and observed in two patients in the ceritinib group; both were grade 3/4, 
were considered serious, and led to study treatment discontinuation. One event of ILD was suspected to be 
study drug-related by the Investigator. “Lung infiltration” was considered to be of infectious origin (not study 
drug related). No deaths were reported due to ILD/pneumonitis. 
Hyperglycemia AEs were reported in 10 patients (8.7%) of which six patients (5.2%) had a grade 3/4 AE. 
Only one patient (0.9%) had a hyperglycemia SAE (grade 3 glucose increase in the context of brain 
metastasis treated with radiotherapy and dexamethasone). Five of the six patients with grade 3/4 
hyperglycemia received concurrent corticosteroids and/or had other underlying disease conditions. None of 
the hyperglycemia AEs was suspected to be study drug related and none of the events led to study drug 
discontinuation. As per laboratory assessment, the frequency of hyperglycemia was similar between the 
ceritinib and chemotherapy groups (49.6% vs. 46.0% with worst grade ≥ 1 post baseline). In the ceritinib 
group, grade 3 hyperglycaemia was reported in 11 patients (9.6%), there were no grade 4 events. In the 
chemotherapy group, six patients (5.3%) and one patient (0.9%) had grade 3 and grade 4 hyperglycaemia 
respectively. Analysis of median/mean blood glucose levels at screening and during the course of the study 
further did not show any increase with start of ceritinib treatment or later during the study. Blood glucose 
levels in the ceritinib group were also not higher compared to the chemotherapy group. 
Pancreatitis AEs were observed in 6.1% of patients in the ceritinib group all of which reported amylase 
increased as preferred term, and no AEs with PT of pancreatitis were reported. None of the events were 
serious and none led to treatment discontinuation. Based on medical review, none of these cases with 
amylase increase were suggestive of (acute) pancreatitis.  
Pancreatitis is an important identified risk in the current risk management plan (RMP) and has been included 
in the Section “Special warnings and precautions for use” and in the ADR Table of the current SmPC. Patients 
should be monitored for lipase and amylase elevations prior to the start of the treatment with ceritinib, and 
periodically thereafter as clinically indicated. 
Ninety-one patients (79%) in the ceritinib group had elevations in blood creatinine levels (all grade 1 and 2) 
based on laboratory assessment of which 22 (19%) were reported as AE. None of these were severe (grade 
3 or 4) or serious (SAE) or lead to study drug discontinuation, and the vast majority of these patients had 
concurrent GI toxicity as potential contributing factor.  
Renal impairment related AEs in the ceritinib treated patients showed an increased frequency of AEs with the 
PT of creatinine increased and hyper-creatininemia (any grade: 30.0% mild, 44.4% moderate vs 3.5% 
normal renal function). Elevations of creatinine were transient and reversible upon treatment 
discontinuation. 
There were no grade 3/4 events of acute kidney injury, renal failure or renal impairment reported in the 
ceritinib group in Study A2303. 
A slightly higher frequency of QT prolongation AEs was found among patients with mild renal impairment 
compared to patients with normal renal function (17.5% mild and 8.8% normal respectively). None of these 
events were grade 3/4, and no SAEs occurred. 
Assessment report  
EMA/367341/2017

In the ceritinib group, one patient each had grade 3 decreased hemoglobin, thrombocytopenia and 
decreased WBCs during the study (no grade 4). Grade 3 absolute lymphocytes (hypo) was reported in 
17.4% of patients with only one grade 4 event. Similar rate of grade ¾ lymphopenia was reported for 
chemotherapy group (23.9%). 
All AESIs are already reflected into de SPC (especially in the section 4.4). 
SAEs: were reported more frequently in the ceritinib group (42.6% ceritinib vs. 31.9% chemotherapy) and 
were commonly associated with progression and/or the underlying disease condition. The frequency of study 
drug-related SAEs was low and similar in both groups with approximately 10% of patients. 
The incidence of study-drug related SAEs was low (11.3%) and included, nausea, vomiting, general physical 
health deterioration, dyspnea, pleural effusion, and pneumonia. There were very few discontinuations due to 
AEs which were suspected to be drug-related (5.2%). 
Deaths: Twenty patients died on-treatment, 15 patients (13.0%) in the ceritinib group and five patients 
(4.4%) in the chemotherapy group. Deaths were mostly related to the underlying disease. The higher 
proportion of on-treatment deaths in the ceritinib group is likely related to the longer exposure and 
substantial number of patients continuing beyond disease progression in the ceritinib group compared to the 
chemotherapy group. The frequency of on-treatment deaths during the first 6 weeks of study treatment was 
similar between the two groups. 
There were no deaths due to study drug-related AEs in the ceritinib group. 
AEs drug-discontinuation: The frequency of study drug discontinuation attributable to AEs was 15.7% vs. 
9.7% in ceritinib vs. chemotherapy group. Most of these AEs in the ceritinib group were related to disease 
progression and were not considered causally related to study drug. Only six patients (5.2%) in the ceritinib 
group discontinued treatment due to AEs which were suspected to be drug-related, compared to 9 patients 
(8.0%) in the chemotherapy group. 
Dose reductions and interruptions were primarily attributable to AEs (hepatotoxicity and GI AEs in the 
ceritinib group). The higher rate of dose reductions and interruptions in the ceritinib group is acceptable for 
a highly active daily treatment that is administered for a prolonged period of time. 
Overall the frequency of AEs and AE leading to treatment interruption, dose modification, was higher in the 
ceritinib group. This could be attributed to the fact that exposure to study treatment in the chemotherapy 
group was very short potentially impacting the frequency of AEs in the chemotherapy group, and therefore, 
should be considered when making comparisons between the two groups. In addition, many patients with 
BIRC-confirmed PD in the ceritinib group continued study treatment while patients with PD in the 
chemotherapy group commonly crossed over to ceritinib or discontinued study treatment. 
The subgroup analysis of safety by region, age, gender, race, presence or absence of brain metastases, and 
WHO PS (0 vs. ≥ 1) at baseline did not reveal any relevant clinically meaningful differences. Potential 
differences were observed in the AESIs in different subgroups, however, this should be interpreted with 
caution due to the small size of the various subgroups and the limited number of patients with certain AESIs 
(e.g. bradycardia, QT prolongation). 
In Study A2303, the median age of patients randomized to the ceritinib group was 54 years (range: 30 to 77 
years; n=89 <65 years, n=26 ≥ 65 years). Among the patients ≥ 65 years, two patients were ≥ 75 -84 
years and none were ≥ 85 years old. In the subgroup analysis of safety by age (<65 years vs. ≥ 65 years) 
that was performed in Study A2303, the safety profile of patients ≥ 65 years was generally consistent with 
that of the overall population, and did not reveal any relevant clinically meaningful differences (≥ 10%). The 
incidence of most AESIs was similar between the two age groups (<65 years vs. ≥ 65 years) except for GI 
toxicity (96.6% vs. 80.8%) and hepatotoxicity (56.2% vs. 42.3%), where the incidence was higher in 
patients <65 years compared to patients ≥ 65 years.

The safety profile of patient who crossed over to ceritinib in the extension-treatment phase was similar to 
the safety profile of patients in the ceritinib group in the treatment phase. 
In summary, the safety profile of ceritinib in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC has been characterized in 
Study A2303, and is consistent with the known safety of ceritinib in this patient population. The adverse 
events (AEs) are manageable and reversible within the clinical setting with dose reduction/interruption 
and/or use of concomitant medication; only very few patients discontinued study treatment due to ceritinib 
associated AEs. No new safety signals or concerns have been identified in Study A2303 except one new ADR 
(weight decreased) and one additional term for the already existing ADR of liver laboratory test 
abnormalities was identified (i.e, GGT and ALP increased). The safety profile of pemetrexed and docetaxel in 
this study was also in line with the expected safety profile of both drugs, however, the frequency of AEs 
tended to be lower, possibly related to the rapid disease progression observed in the chemotherapy group 
resulting in short treatment exposure. 
Based on laboratory data review, 12/26 (47.2%) and 15/26 (57.7%) of patients with an event of ALP and 
GGT increased, respectively, had an abnormal baseline value of the corresponding laboratory parameter 
prior to treatment start with ceritinib. The event of ALP increased resolved in 18/26 (69.2%) patients and 
GGT increased in 16/26 patients (61.5%). None of the AEs were SAEs, and no study drug discontinuations 
occurred due specifically to ALP or GGT increase, furthermore, generally do not require specific management 
guidelines. No association was found with bilirubin increase, and the abnormalities were reversible with no 
evidence for prolonged or severe cholestatic injury despite treatment continuation. 
Based on a comprehensive review of the available safety information from Study A2303, “blood ALP 
increased” has been added as a new term to the existing ADR “Liver laboratory test abnormalities”. 
Furthermore, in the update SmPC, “ALP increased” has been identified as a new ADR and has been proposed 
to be added to Table 2 of Section 4.8 “Undesirable effects” of the SmPC under the term “Liver laboratory test 
abnormalities” in the system organ class (SOC) “Investigations”. “GGT increased” was already included in 
Table 2 of the SmPC under the same term and SOC at the time of the initial Marketing Authorization 
Application. Increases in ALP and GGT are managed in the context of hepatotoxicity and no additional 
guidance is needed in the SmPC. 
In support of this risk assessment of ceritinib, the evaluation of the information received from the MAH 
global pharmacovigilance safety database until 10-Aug-2016 in 22 ongoing studies did not reveal any new 
safety concern or a change in frequency or severity of AEs, and does not suggest an update to the 
characterization of the risks is needed. No new information has emerged based on post-marketing usage of 
ceritinib that would substantially alter the known safety profile. In conclusion, the safety data is consistent 
with the known safety profile of ceritinib. No untoward effects have been reported in ongoing trials and 
pharmacovigilance activities that would materially alter the established safety profile of ceritinib. Routine 
pharmacovigilance activities, including regular targeted follow-up, should be continued to be performed.

Clinical aspects 
Question 1  
The second and final analysis of OS should be provided when available along with an update of the overall 
efficacy results. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
At the time of the primary progression-free survival (PFS) analysis, the first pre-planned interim OS analysis 
was conducted. The OS data were still immature at the time of the data cut-off (26-Jan-2016) with a total of 
67 patients (58.3%) in the ceritinib arm and 66 patients (56.9%) in the chemotherapy arm censored for 
survival [Study A2303 CSR]. 
Based on the current information available, the next planned OS interim analysis (with approximately 171 
OS events) is expected to be performed around December 2018. The final OS analysis (with approximately 
196 OS events) is expected to be performed around May 2021. Due to the event-driven nature of these 
analyses, the actual timing could differ from the projections. 
As specified in the protocol, no further analyses of PFS are planned as the primary PFS objective has been 
met. At the time of the cut-off for the primary analysis (26-Jan-2016), there were 22 patients (19.1%) in the 
ceritinib arm and 7 patients (6.0%) in the chemotherapy arm censored as “ongoing without an event” for 
PFS by BIRC [Study A2303 CSR-Section 11.4.1.1]. Hence, longer follow-up of ongoing patients for PFS is not 
expected to change the primary PFS analysis results substantially. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
OS data were immature at the time of the primary PFS analysis.  With an event rate of 42% and 43% for 
ceritinib and chemotherapy arm respectively, no conclusive results in terms of OS were observed (HR 1.00 
95%CI 0.67, 1.49). The high cross-over rate (65% of patients had crossed over to ceritinib arm along with 
the subsequent therapy with ALK inhibitors) likely impacted study results, however a sensitivity analysis 
carried out as an attempt to correct for crossover, showed similar results (HR 0.97 95%CI 0.65, 1.45). 
Although these results even stressed more the need of submission of mature OS data, it does not seem 
possible to assess mature OS data within the current variation procedure according to the applicant´s 
response. The second OS interim analysis will not be available until the end of 2018 and final OS analysis is 
expected around May 2021. Importantly, more mature data are not expected to modify the Benefit risk 
balance, given the likely absence of relevant findings in survival due to the high rate of crossover. So, even 
further updates are recommendable, a significant effect on OS is not foreseen. 
Results from the phase III trial, study A2303, showed a clinically meaningful result, both in PFS and ORR. 
These results are in line with data from the previous studies which were the basis of the conditional MA and 
appear sufficient so as to positively conclude about the benefit/risk of ceritinib, however submission of 
mature OS data is recommended, when available (recommendation, see section 3). The data supporting 
the benefit/risk of ceritinib can be considered comprehensive and supporting the switch from conditional to 
full MA.   
Conclusion:  
Issue solved

Question 2  
One new ADR (weight decreased) and one additional term for the already existing ADR of liver laboratory 
test abnormalities were identified. Given the high incidence of GGT and ALP increased and weight decreases, 
more recommendations regarding management, severity and expected duration in the SmPC.  
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Liver laboratory test abnormalities 
Hepatotoxicity is a known side effect of ceritinib, and mainly characterized by asymptomatic, transient liver 
enzyme increases. In Study A2303, one hepatotoxicity adverse event (AE) (grade 3 jaundice) was serious 
[Study A2303 CSR]; this event was not suspected to be study drug-related, occurred in the context of biliary 
obstruction, and resolved upon biliary stent placement. In addition, 2 patients (1.7%) had hepatotoxicity AE 
leading to treatment discontinuation [Study A2303 CSR]. The events, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
increased and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased, of both patients resolved after treatment 
discontinuation. No Hy’s law cases (i.e. concurrent aminotransferases >3× upper limit of normal (ULN) and 
total bilirubin (TIBLI) >2×ULN and ALP <2×ULN) and no concurrent aminotransferases >3×ULN and TBILI 
>2×ULN have been observed with ceritinib in Study A2303 [Study A2303 CSR-Section 12.3.3.4.1]. 
The current SmPC clearly lists AEs of liver toxicity as common side effects of ceritinib. These AEs are included 
in the “Special warnings and precautions for use” in Section 4.4, in the dose modification guidance in Section 
4.2, and in the ADR Table in Section 4.8 (“Liver Laboratory Test Abnormalities” such as ALT increased, AST 
increased, GGT increased, blood bilirubin increased, transaminases increased, hepatic enzyme increased, 
and liver function test abnormal, and “Hepatotoxicity” including drug-induced liver injury, hepatitis 
cholestatic, hepatocellular injury, hepatotoxicity). Based on a comprehensive review of the available safety 
information from Study A2303 using the ADR selection criteria outlined in [Study A2303 CO-Section 5.5] 
(i.e. event occurring in >2% of patients and/or at least 3 more patients in the ceritinib group compared to 
the chemotherapy group and reasonable relationship with ceritinib by medical assessment), “blood ALP 
increased” has been added as a new term to the existing ADR “Liver laboratory test abnormalities”. 
GGT/ALP together with AST/ALT and bilirubin were part of the liver panel used in Study A2303 and other 
certinib studies to help better characterize liver toxicity and rule out other causes (i.e. obstruction, 
cholestasis, bone or liver metastasis), which are common in this patient population and can be confounding 
factors. GGT/ALP on their own have limited clinical value and generally do not require specific management 
guidelines. 
ALP and GGT increased 
In Study A2303, of the 115 patients treated with ceritinib, 26 patients (22.6%) reported at least one AE each 
of blood ALP increased or GGT increased (any grade, regardless of causality) compared to 0.9% and 1.8% 
in the chemotherapy group, respectively [Study A2303 CSR]. Most of these (in 18.3% and 15.7% patients, 
respectively) were suspected to be related to study treatment [Study A2303 CSR]. None of the AEs were 
SAEs [Study A2303 CSR], and no study drug discontinuations occurred due specifically to ALP or GGT 
increase [Study A2303 CSR]. 
Based on AE data amongst patients who had an event of ALP increased (n=26), the median time to onset of 
the first ALP increase regardless of causality with study treatment was 25.5 days (range: 10 to 296 days) 
(Table 5-1). Most of these events were grade 1 or 2; seven patients (6.1%) reported grade 3 events; no 
grade 4 blood ALP increase was reported. The event resolved in 18/26 (69.2%) patients with a median time 
to recovery of 27.0 days (range: 17 to 123 days); in the remaining 8 patients the event was improving or

ongoing at the time of the data cut-off (6/8 patients discontinued the study due to disease progression or 
death, two patients were ongoing). 
Amongst patients who had an event of GGT increased (n=26), the median time to onset of the first GGT 
increase (regardless of causality with study treatment)) was 22.0 days (range: 1 to 294 days) (Table 42). 
Twenty-one patients (18.3%) had grade 3 GGT increased, and 3 patients (2.6%) had a grade 4 event. As 
mentioned above, none of these were SAEs. The events resolved in 16/26 patients (61.5%) with a median 
time to recovery of 63.5 days (range: 22 to 279 days), in the remaining 10 patients the event was improving 
or ongoing at the time of data cut-off (8/10 patients discontinued the study due to disease progression or 
death, two were ongoing). 
Based on laboratory data review, 12/26 (47.2%) and 15/26 (57.7%) of patients with an event of ALP and 
GGT increased, respectively, had an abnormal baseline value of the corresponding laboratory parameter 
prior to treatment start with ceritinib [CSR A2303-Listing 16.2.8-1.4], [CSR A2303-Listing 16.2.8-1.7]. In 
addition, most of the patients with ontreatment ALP/GGT increase had concurrent transaminitis (24/26 
patients with ALP increase and 25/26 patients with GGT increase); however, there were no cases of 
concurrent bilirubin increase. 
Table 42: Characteristics of first on-treatment adverse event "ALP increased" and “GGT 
increased”, regardless of study drug relationship in the ceritinib group of Study A2303 (Safety 
set) 
In summary, while common, GGT and ALP increases are transient and asymptomatic laboratory changes 
typically associated with transaminitis in patients treated with ceritinib (cholestatic component or mixed 
type injury); no association was found with bilirubin increase, and the abnormalities were reversible with no

evidence for prolonged or severe cholestatic injury despite treatment continuation. In addition, > 30% of 
patients with GGT and ALP increase had abnormal values at baseline. The incidence of ALP/GGT increased 
was consistent with the incidence observed in a more recent, larger safety pool (N=925) of ceritinib treated 
patients with ALK-positive NSCLC [Study A2301 SCS-Section 2.1.6.1]. 
“ALP increased” has been identified as a new ADR and has been proposed to be added to Table 2 of Section 
4.8 “Undesirable effects” of the SmPC under the term “Liver laboratory test abnormalities” in the system 
organ class (SOC) “Investigations”. “GGT increased” was already included in Table 2 of the SmPC under the 
same term and SOC at the time of the initial Marketing Authorization Application. In addition, the current 
monitoring and risk management guidelines on hepatocellular injury are deemed adequate as (1) both GGT 
and ALP are routine parameters in hepatic laboratory test panels and (2) GGT and ALP typically present with 
concurrent transaminitis. Increases in these liver enzymes are therefore managed in the context of 
hepatotoxicity and no additional guidance is needed in the SmPC. 
Weight decreased 
“Weight decreased” has been identified as a new ADR based on the selection criteria outlined in [Study 
A2303 CO-Section 5.5]. 
In Study A2303, 29.6% of patients in the ceritinib group had weight decreased (any grade, regardless of 
causality with study treatment) compared to 6.2% in the chemotherapy group [Study A2303 CSR]. 18.3% 
of patients on ceritinib and 2.7% on chemotherapy had weight decreased which was suspected to be related 
to study treatment by the Investigator [Study A2303 CSR]. Of note, median duration of treatment exposure 
(6.3 weeks chemotherapy vs 30.3 weeks ceritinib) and with that the observation time was very short in the 
chemotherapy group compared to ceritinib [Study A2303 CSR]. Weight decrease was generally mild or 
moderate (grade 1 or 2); 3 patients had grade 3 weight decrease (compared to one patient in the 
chemotherapy group). No grade 4 weight decrease was reported, and none of the events was considered 
serious. 
Based on body weight measurements, the mean highest change (standard deviation [SD]) in weight 
post-baseline was 0.5 kg (4.1) and the mean lowest change (SD) was −5.5 kg (4.2) in the ceritinib group.  
The mean highest change (SD) in weight post-baseline was 0.8 kg (3.2) and the mean lowest change (SD) 
was −1.2 kg (2.7) in the chemotherapy group [Study A2303 CSR]. Based on AE data amongst patients who 
had an event of weight decreased (n=34), the median time to onset of first weight decrease regardless of 
causality with study treatment was 45.0 days (range: 1 to 439 days) (Table 43). The events resolved in 
13/34 patients (38.2%) with a median time to recovery of 24.5 days (range: 8 to 232 days); in the 
remaining 21 patients the event was ongoing at the time of the data cut-off (15/21 patients discontinued the 
study due to disease progression or death, three patients due to subject decision, and three were ongoing; 
in 1/21 patients, the event had improved from grade 2 to grade 1) [Study A2303 CSR-Listing 16.2.7-1.1]. 
Assessment report  
EMA/367341/2017 
Page 83/94 
 
  
  
Table 43: Characteristics of first on-treatment adverse event "weight decreased", regardless of 
study drug relationship for ceritinib (Safety set) 
In summary, mild to moderate weight decrease has been observed in approximately one quarter of patients 
treated with ceritinib; no SAEs have been described, and 3 patients reported grade 3 weight decrease during 
the course of the study. Frequency and severity of weight decreased was consistent with the incidence 
observed in a more recent, larger safety pool (N=925) of ceritinib treated patients with ALK-positive NSCLC 
[Study A2301 SCS-Section 4.1.2]. 
Weight loss may be linked to a variety of causes including tumor cachexia-anorexia, malnutrition, 
comorbidities and disease progression, all of which are expected to be observed in an advanced NSCLC 
patient population like in Study A2303. In addition, treatment-related side effects such as asthenia, 
decreased appetite or gastro-intestinal toxicity (all known ADRs of ceritinib) may be (temporary) 
contributing factors. More than one third of patients recovered from the initial event of weight decrease. 
Most of the patients with an ongoing event at the time of the data cut-off, progressed and discontinued the 
study. The relatively low frequency of weight decrease in the chemotherapy group is likely explained by the 
very short treatment duration and observation time. 
At this stage, Novartis is of the opinion that additional recommendations regarding management, severity or 
duration of weight decreased are not needed in the SmPC. Weight decreased is a common observation in the 
advanced oncology setting that requires individualized management depending on the underlying causes. 
The event has been newly listed as a very common ADR in the ceritinib SmPC. In addition, adequate 
guidance is provided for relevant ADRs such as gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity including dose 
adjustment/interruptions that should be applied for any clinically relevant ADR based on individual 
tolerability.

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
Based on laboratory data review, 12/26 (47.2%) and 15/26 (57.7%) of patients with an event of ALP and 
GGT increased, respectively, had an abnormal baseline value of the corresponding laboratory parameter 
prior to treatment start with ceritinib. The event of ALP increased resolved in 18/26 (69.2%) patients and 
GGT increased in 16/26 patients (61.5%). None of the AEs were SAEs, and no study drug discontinuations 
occurred due specifically to ALP or GGT increase, furthermore, generally do not require specific 
management guidelines. No association was found with bilirubin increase, and the abnormalities were 
reversible with no evidence for prolonged or severe cholestatic injury despite treatment continuation. 
Based on a comprehensive review of the available safety information from Study A2303, “blood ALP 
increased” has been added as a new term to the existing ADR “Liver laboratory test abnormalities”. 
Furthermore, in the update SmPC, “ALP increased” has been identified as a new ADR and has been 
proposed to be added to Table 2 of Section 4.8 “Undesirable effects” of the SmPC under the term “Liver 
laboratory test abnormalities” in the system organ class (SOC) “Investigations”. “GGT increased” was 
already included in Table 2 of the SmPC under the same term and SOC at the time of the initial Marketing 
Authorization Application. Increases in ALP and GGT are managed in the context of hepatotoxicity and no 
additional guidance is needed in the SmPC. 
Based on Study A2303 data, 29.6% of patients in the ceritinib group had weight decreased (any grade, 
regardless of causality with study treatment), 18.3% of patients was suspected to be related to study 
treatment by the Investigator and the events were resolved in 38.2% of patients. No SAEs have been 
described. Based on body weight measurements, the mean highest change (standard deviation [SD]) in 
weight post-baseline was 0.5 kg (4.1) and the mean lowest change (SD) was −5.5 kg (4.2) in the ceritinib 
group. More than one third of patients recovered from the initial event of weight decrease. Thus, additional 
recommendations regarding management, severity or duration of weight decreased are not needed in the 
SmPC, because the individualized management is required and “Weight decreased” was already included in 
section 4.8, Table 2 of the SmPC. 
Conclusion:  
Issue solved 
Question 3  
The Applicant should provide a more detailed assessment of AEs occurring in elderly patients, broken down 
in different age subgroups (Age <65 yrs, 65-74 yrs, 75-84 yrs, ≥ 85 yrs). 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
In Study A2303, the median age of patients randomized to the ceritinib group was 54 years (range: 30 to 77 
years; n=89 <65 years, n=26 ≥ 65 years) [Study A2303 CSR]. Among the patients ≥ 65 years, two patients 
were ≥ 75 -84 years and none were ≥ 85 years old [Study A2303 CSR-Listing 16.2.4-1.1]. 
For the 2 patients ≥ 75 years age enrolled in Study A2303, a summary of key safety findings is provided 
below; for detailed narratives, see [Study A2303 CSR-Section 14.3.3]: 
•  Patient [A2303-1202-003] was a 77 year old male patient with NSCLC adenocarcinoma metastatic to 
bone, brain, lung and mediastinal lymph nodes at study entry; no relevant medical history was reported. 
-  On Day 127, the patient reported one SAE of grade 3 hyponatremia suspected to be possibly 
treatment related as per the Investigator, upon which the patient was hospitalized and ceritinib 
temporarily interrupted. Prior to that, the patient was diagnosed with disease progression in the 
Assessment report

brain (Day 85), however, treatment with ceritinib was continued as the Investigator judged it to be 
in the best interest of the patient. Between Day 105 and 116, the patient received palliative brain 
radiotherapy. Hyponatremia was reported to have occurred in the context of a syndrome of 
inappropriate diuretic hormone (SIADH) as a consequence of cerebral irradiation. 
-  Grade 4 serum amylase increased was reported on Day 107. The event was not suspected to be 
treatment related, and recovered after 20 days with no action taken. The event was likely a 
consequence of the brain radiotherapy involving the salivary glands; there was no clinical evidence 
for (acute) pancreatitis such as vomiting or abdominal pain and lipase values were normal. 
-  On Day 211, study treatment was permanently discontinued due to patient's decision. 
•  Patient [A2303-1254-001] was a 76 year old female patient with NSCLC adenocarcinoma metastatic to 
the bone lymph nodes, lung and pleura at study entry; no relevant medical history was reported. The 
patient had normal glucose value at baseline, and received supportive prednisolone prior/during the 
study; she also had grade 2 decreased creatinine clearance prior to randomization. 
-  No SAEs were reported for this patient. 
-  On Day 29, the patient was noted with grade 2 weight decrease, and creatinine clearance worsened 
to grade 3. No action was taken. The event was suspected to be related to study treatment. 
-  On Day 46, a computed tomography scan revealed disease progression (worsening pleural effusion 
and bronchopulmonary lymph nodes, and new lesions in the brain). 
-  On Day 57, the patient developed grade 3 hyperglycemia (14.2 mmol/L) which was not suspected to 
be treatment related as per investigator assessment; the patient had also elevated white blood cells 
(13.9 × 109/L) and absolute neutrophil counts (13.27 × 109/L), indicative of a possible infection. On 
the same day, the patient was discontinued due to disease progression and died 33 days later due 
to NSCLC. 
In the subgroup analysis of safety by age (<65 years vs ≥ 65 years vs) that was performed in Study A2303, 
see clinical study report), the safety profile of patients ≥ 65 years was generally consistent with that of the 
overall population, and did not reveal any relevant clinically meaningful differences (≥ 10%) [Study A2303 
CSR]. The incidence of most AESIs was similar between the two age groups (<65 years vs ≥ 65 years) 
except for GI toxicity (96.6% vs 80.8%) and hepatotoxicity (56.2% vs 42.3%), where the incidence was 
higher in patients <65 years compared to patients ≥ 65 years. Of note, the overall incidence of GI toxicity 
AESIs was high, and the subgroups relatively small [Study A2303 CSR]. In summary, the overall safety 
profile in the subgroup of patients <65 years is similar to the safety profile in the subgroup of patients ≥ 65 
years. 
A clinically meaningful and consistent PFS benefit was observed across both age categories in Study A2303 
[Study A2303 CSR]. A subgroup analysis by age (i.e. ≥ 65 years vs <65 years and ≥ 70 years vs <70 years) 
in a more recent, larger safety pool (N=925) of ceritinib treated patients with ALK-positive NSCLC did not 
identify any clinically relevant differences within the subgroups [Study A2301 CSR], [Study A2301 
SCS-Section 5.1.1]. 
This suggests that the risk/benefit profile of ceritinib is consistent in ALK-positive NSCLC patients ≥ 65 years 
old with that of patients <65 years.

Question 4  
In study 2303, 17 patients (14.8%) had elevated amylase levels already at baseline; in particular, one out 
of the three grade 3 cases had grade 2 amylase increase at baseline and two had normal amylase (grade 0) 
at baseline, and two out of the three grade 4 cases had grade 3 amylase increase at baseline and one had 
normal amylase (grade 0) at baseline. Post-baseline, three (2.6%) patients had lipase elevations of any 
grade, of which two patients had grade 1 lipase elevations and one patient had grade 2 lipase elevation and 
no patients had grade 3 or 4 elevations. The Applicant is requested to submit and analyze available safety 
results in patients with hepatic impairment. The applicant is asked to update report about pancreatitis 
events that occurred during the clinical study. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Safety in patients with hepatic impairment 
Safety data from Study A2303 were analyzed by baseline hepatic function based on the liver function 
classification from the National Cancer Institute Organ Dysfunction Working Group (NCI-ODWG 2009): 
-  Normal hepatic function: TBILI ≤ ULN and AST ≤ ULN; 
-  Mild hepatic impairment: TBILI ≤ ULN and AST >ULN or TBILI >ULN and TBILI ≤ 1.5xULN and AST any 
value); 
-  Moderate hepatic impairment: TBILI >1.5xULN and TBILI ≤ 3.0×ULN and AST any value; 
-  Severe hepatic impairment: TBILI >3xULN and AST any value. 
Of note, patients with AST/ALT >2.5xULN (except for patients with liver metastases: >5xULN) or bilirubin 
>1.5xULN (except Gilbert's disease: >3xULN) were excluded from the study as per protocol, hence, no 
patients with moderate/severe hepatic impairment at baseline were enrolled into Study A2303; 184 patients 
(n=92 in each treatment group) had normal liver function , and 40 patients (n=22 in the ceritinib group, 
n=18 in the chemotherapy group) had mild hepatic impairment at baseline. 
The overall frequency of all grade AEs, grade 3/4 AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, and AEs 
requiring dose adjustments or delays was similar in patients with mild hepatic impairment at baseline 
compared to patients with normal hepatic function at baseline in both treatment groups in Study A2303 
(Table 44). The interpretation of the slightly higher incidence of on-treatment deaths in ceritinib treated 
patients with mild hepatic impairment at base 
line compared to patients with normal hepatic function at baseline is limited due to the small subgroup size 
and limited number of patients with an event, and is in line with the overall patient population. All deaths 
were due to study indication. The same trend was seen in the chemotherapy group [Study A2303 CSR]. 
A review of AEs by SOC in patients with mild hepatic impairment and normal hepatic function at baseline did 
not reveal any differential safety profile in the two patient populations in the ceritinib group [Study A2303 
RSI Appendix 1-CHMP Table 26]. The frequency and severity of AESIs were similar in patients with mild

hepatic impairment compared to patients with normal hepatic function at baseline in the ceritinib group in 
Study A2303 [Study A2303 RSI Appendix 1-CHMP]. 
In summary, the review of the overall safety profile of ceritinib in patients with hepatic impairment at 
baseline versus patients with normal hepatic function at baseline did not reveal any clinically relevant 
differences or new safety concerns, and is consistent with the known safety profile of ceritinib. 
Table 44: Overview of adverse events in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC, subgroup of hepatic 
impairment (Study A2303, safety set) 
Pancreatitis 
The Novartis MedDRA Query (broad) ‘Acute pancreatitis (excluding non-specific symptoms)’ was used to 
identify and define the frequency of pancreatitis events. This query comprises the standardized MedDRA 
query (SMQ) (narrow) ‘Acute Pancreatitis’ and the preferred terms (PT) related to pancreatic enzyme 
abnormalities including lipase and amylase increase. 
In the Novartis global safety database (Argus), there have been no reports on pancreatitis related SAEs in 
Study A2303 from the data lock point of 26-Jan-2016 until 03-Feb-2017. 
In a more recent, larger safety pool (N=925) of ceritinib treated patients with ALK-positive NSCLC, 
pancreatitis grouped AEs (all grades, regardless of study drug relationship) were reported in 89 patients 
(9.6%), with the majority of patients having laboratory test abnormalities (i.e. amylase/lipase increase) 
without reported evidence of pancreatitis [Study A2301 SCS Appendix 1]. 
In summary, the frequency and type of AEs of pancreatitis are consistent with the established safety profile 
of ceritinib and can be effectively managed with dose reductions/interruptions and/or use of concomitant 
Assessment report

medication. Pancreatitis AEs mainly comprised asymptomatic increases in amylase/lipase levels. None of the 
pancreatitis AEs were serious or led to treatment discontinuation, and none of these were suggestive of 
pancreatitis. No new cases have been reported in Study A2303 since the data cut-off for the primary 
analysis. 
Pancreatitis has been included in the Section “Special warnings and precautions for use” and in the ADR 
Table of the current SmPC. Patients should be monitored for lipase and amylase elevations prior to the start 
of the treatment with ceritinib, and periodically thereafter as clinically indicated. In addition, pancreatitis is 
an important identified risk in the current risk management plan (RMP). 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
As requested, the applicant submits and analyzes available safety results in patients with hepatic 
impairment. The review of the overall safety profile of ceritinib in patients with mild hepatic impairment at 
baseline versus patients with normal hepatic function at baseline did not reveal any clinically relevant 
differences or new safety concerns, and is consistent with the known safety profile of ceritinib. No patients 
with moderate/severe hepatic impairment at baseline were enrolled into Study A2303. 
The interpretation of the slightly higher incidence of on-treatment deaths in ceritinib treated patients with 
mild hepatic impairment at baseline compared to patients with normal hepatic function at baseline is limited 
due to the small subgroup size and limited number of patients with an event. All deaths were due to study 
indication. 
As requested, the applicant is update report about pancreatitis events that occurred during the clinical 
study. In a larger safety pool (N=925) of ceritinib treated patients with ALK-positive NSCLC, pancreatitis 
grouped AEs (all grades, regardless of study drug relationship) were reported in 89 patients (9.6%). No 
new cases have been reported in Study A2303 since the data cut-off for the primary analysis. 
Pancreatitis is an important identified risk in the current risk management plan (RMP) and has been

Conclusion:  
Issue solved 
Question 5  
In study 2303, twenty-two (19.1%) patients in the ceritinib vs. none in the chemotherapy group had 
creatinine elevations based on AEs. In 2/10 patients the event was grade 3 (chronic kidney disease and 
urinary bladder rupture). In addition to the 22 patients with blood creatinine increase reported under the 
SOC of “Investigations”, creatinine renal clearance decreased was reported in three patients of whom one 
patient had grade 3 event. All three events were suspected to be study drug-related. The Applicant is 
requested to submit and analyze available safety results in patients with renal impairment. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Safety data from Study A2303 were analyzed by baseline renal function based on the definitions from the 
Food and Drug Administration renal guidance (FDA PK Renal Guidance 2010): 
•  Normal renal function: Creatinine clearance ≥ 90 mL/min; 
•  Mild renal impairment: Creatinine clearance ≥ 60 and <90 mL/min; 
Assessment report  
EMA/367341/2017 
Page 89/94 
 
  
  
•  Moderate renal impairment: Creatinine clearance ≥ 30 and <60 mL/min; 
•  Severe renal impairment: Creatinine clearance <30 mL/min. 
Patients with serum creatinine >1.5 g/dL and/or calculated clearance <50 mL/min were excluded from the 
study as per protocol. 
In Study A2303, 106 patients (n=57 in the ceritinib group, n=49 in the chemotherapy group) with normal 
renal function were enrolled, 90 patients (n=40 in the ceritinib group, n=50 in the chemotherapy group) had 
mild renal impairment, and 31 patients (n=18 in the ceritinib group, n=13 in the chemotherapy group) had 
moderate renal impairment at baseline. One patient randomized to the chemotherapy arm had severe renal 
impairment at baseline. A review of the baseline patient and disease characteristics showed that patients 
with impaired baseline renal function were older compared to those with normal renal function (the median 
age for patients with moderate renal impairment was 65.5 years compared to 60.0 years for mild 
impairment and 48 years for patients with normal renal function) [Study A2303 RSI Appendix 1-CHMP], 
[Study A2303 RSI Appendix 1-CHMP]. 
"Renal failure", "renal impairment" and "blood creatinine increased" are listed as ADRs in the SmPC. Of note, 
creatinine increase is mainly considered a pharmacologic effect of ceritinib (i.e. inhibition of tubular 
creatinine secretion), and not due to direct nephrotoxicity (see detailed discussion in [Study A2303 CSR – 
Section 13]). Elevations of creatinine were transient and reversible upon treatment discontinuation. None of 
these events were grade 3 or 4, or serious. In addition, there were no grade 3/4 events of acute kidney 
injury, renal failure or renal impairment reported in the ceritinib group in Study A2303. 
More details for the three grade 3 events that were specifically mentioned in Question 5 are provided below: 
•  Patient [A2303-1851-002] with grade 3 chronic kidney disease was a 66 year old man with a history of 
hypertension; baseline creatinine clearance was decreased (grade 2); creatinine clearance was 
fluctuating between grade 2 and 3 during the study; grade 3 chronic kidney disease was reported on Day 
14 and resolved on Day 28 (suspected to be study drug related by the Investigator); the patient was 
ongoing at time of data cut-off (Day 608); the last creatinine value prior to discontinuation (Day 586) was 
normal, and creatinine clearance was back to baseline (grade 2). 
•  Patient [A2303-1254-003] with grade 3 iatrogenic bladder rupture (Day 389) following a urogram; the 
event was not related to study treatment. 
•  Patient [A2303-1254-001] with grade 3 creatinine renal clearance decreased was a 76 year old women 
with grade 2 creatinine clearance decreased at baseline; on Day 29 the event worsened to grade 3 
(suspected to be study drug related by the Investigator); the patient discontinued the study on Day 57 
due to disease progression (worsening of pleural effusion, pulmonary lymph nodes and new brain 
metastasis); the event was ongoing at time of discontinuation. 
Overall, the AE pattern was similar in patients with mild and moderate renal impairment compared to 
patients with normal renal function at baseline in the ceritinib group in Study A2303 (Table 45). A similar 
trend was seen in the chemotherapy group.

Table 45: Overview of adverse events in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC, subgroup of renal 
impairment (Study A2303, safety set) 
In patients with mild and moderate renal impairment at baseline compared to patients with normal renal 
function, renal impairment related AEs in the ceritinib treated patients showed an increased frequency of 
AEs with the PT of creatinine increased and hyper-creatininemia (any grade: 30.0% mild, 44.4% moderate 
vs 3.5% normal renal function) [Study A2303 RSI Appendix 1-CHMP]. No grade 3/4 AEs of creatinine 
increase occurred in any subgroup, and there were no SAEs. This is in line with the baseline renal status of 
the different patient populations. In addition, single events of renal impairment, acute kidney injury, and 
renal failure (all grade 1/2) were reported in patients with baseline mild and moderate renal impairment, 
none of these events were reported as SAEs. One SAE of urinary bladder rupture was reported as an SAE in 
the subgroup of patients with moderate renal impairment (see above) No such events were reported from 
patients with baseline normal renal function (events reported only related to creatinine increased). 
The frequency and severity of AESIs (hepatoxicity, gastrointestinal toxicity, QT prolongation, 
pneumonitis/ILD, pancreatitis, hyperglycemia, bradycardia) in patients with mild and moderate renal 
impairment at baseline was overall similar compared to patients with normal renal function at baseline in the 
ceritinib group in Study A2303 [Study A2303 RSI Appendix 1-CHMP]. A trend of higher frequency of GGT and 
ALP increase was seen in the mild and moderate renal impairment populations in comparison with patients 
with normal renal function at baseline (GGT: 12.3% normal vs 32.5% mild vs 33.3% moderate; ALP: 10.5% 
normal vs 30.0% mild vs 44.4% moderate [Study A2303 RSI Appendix 1-CHMP]), however, there was no 
major difference in the overall hepatotoxicity events [Study A2303 RSI Appendix 1-CHMP]. None of these 
events were reported as SAEs. Two events of study drug discontinuation were reported, one event each in 
a patient with normal renal function and moderate renal impairment. Both discontinuations were due to 
AST/ALT increase. No study drug discontinuation due to hepatotoxic events was reported in the group of 
patients with baseline mild renal impairment. 
A slightly higher frequency of QT prolongation AEs was found among patients with mild renal impairment 
compared to patients with normal renal function (17.5% mild and 8.8% normal respectively, [Study A2303 
Assessment report  
EMA/367341/2017 
Page 91/94 
 
  
  
 
RSI Appendix 1-CHMP]). One QT prolongation AE was reported in a patient (5.6%) with moderate renal 
impairment. None of these events were grade 3/4, and no SAEs occurred. 
In summary, an examination of the overall safety profile of ceritinib in patients with renal impairment versus 
patients with normal renal function at baseline did not reveal any clinically relevant differences in the safety 
risks or any new safety concerns.

Question 6  
In study 2303, the number and percentage of patients with increase from baseline QTcF > 30 msec were 
71/114 (62.3%) in ceritinib group vs. 7/112 (6.3%) in chemotherapy group, from baseline QTcF > 60 msec 
were 7/114 (6.1%) in ceritinib group vs. 0/112 (0%) in chemotherapy group and new QTcF > 450 msec 
were 37/113 (32.7%) vs. 11/109 (10.1%) in chemotherapy group. The number and percentage of patients 
with increase from baseline QTcP > 30 msec were 66/115 (57.4%) in ceritinib group vs. 6/112 (5.4%) in 
chemotherapy group, from baseline QTcP > 60 msec were 7/115 (6.1%) in ceritinib group vs. 0/112 (0%) 
in chemotherapy group. The Applicant is asked to discuss in detail these results. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Ceritinib is known to have a relevant QT prolonging effect, thus, a higher percentage of patients with a 
prolonged QTc interval is expected in the ceritinib group compared to the chemotherapy group [Study A2303 
CSR]. 
An analysis of ECG data from 86 patients with time-matched ceritinib plasma concentrations in Study A2303 
showed a concentration-dependent QTcP interval prolongation with an estimated 14.0 ms mean QTcP 
increase from baseline at median steady-state Cmin, with the upper bound of the 2-sided 90% confidence 
interval (18.1 ms) for mean QTcP change from baseline <20 ms [Study A2303 CSR-Section 12.3.3.4.3], 
Assessment report  
EMA/367341/2017 
Page 92/94 
 
  
  
 
[Study A2303 CSR], [Study A2303 CSR]. These data are consistent with previous studies as well as the 
recently completed Phase III Study A2301, where a central tendency analysis at average steady-state 
concentrations (Cycle 2, Day 1) demonstrated that the mean QTcP change from baseline was 13.5 ms (90% 
CI: 11.8, 15.3) [Study A2301 SCS-Section 2.1.6.3]. 
Pronounced cases of QTcF or QTcP prolongation (i.e. >500 ms or >60 ms increase from baseline) were rare 
(see Table 46). Three (3) patients (2.6%) in the ceritinib group had a postbaseline QTcP in the interval >480 
– 500 ms, and one patient (0.9%) had a post-baseline QTcP >500 ms in the ceritinib group. The latter was 
a 67-year-old female patient with active medical condition of left ventricular dysfunction, atherosclerosis, 
hypertension, and thalassemia. The patient had a QTcP interval of 436 ms at baseline; on Day 382, the ECG 
showed a QTcP of 502 ms which returned to 442 ms on the end-of-study (Day 430). Based on an internal 
cardiologist review of this patient, it was noted that the ECG tracings were of poor quality with prominent 
U-waves that could limit the ability to measure QTc accurately (QT offset) [Study A2303 CSR-Section 
12.3.3.4.3]. In addition, one of the 3 patients with postbaseline QTcP >480 – 500 ms had already a grade 2 
(>450 – 480 ms) QTcP prolongation at baseline [Study A2303 CSR]. 
Out of the 7 patients with QTcP increases from baseline >60 ms, all had a baseline QTcP ≤ 450 ms; one of 
these patients had a post-baseline increase in QTcP >500 ms (described above), two had a post-baseline 
increase in QTcP >480 – 500 ms, three had QTcP >450 – 480 ms, and one had QTcP <450 ms [Study A2303 
CSR-Listing 16.2.9-1.2]. Similar results were observed based on QTcF (Table 46). 
Table 46: Patients with notable ECG values in Study A2303 and Pooled Dataset 
Based on AE data (SMQ broad “Torsade de pointes/QT prolongation”), grade 3 QT prolongation AEs were 
reported in two (1.7%) patients. None of the QT prolongation AEs led to study drug discontinuation. There 
were no grade 4 QT prolongation AEs or Torsade de points, and no patients with AE of QT prolongation 
(preferred term) had syncope/loss of consciousness. Two patients had grade 3 QT prolongation AEs which 
were also reported as SAEs and are described in detail in the CSR/narratives. In brief, one patient had grade 
3 QT prolongation with concurrent grade 4 hypokalemia in the context of vomiting and dehydration; the 
event was diagnosed based on local ECG (not supported be central ECG) and resolved upon potassium 
substitution. The other patient had abnormal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suggestive of disease 
progression on Day 43, and new lesions in the liver, lung, and calvarium (with soft tissue component on 
brain MRI) as per RECIST; treatment was interrupted on Day 61 due to creatinine increase and upon 
confirmation of disease progression by BIRC. Three days later, the patient experienced grade 4 loss of 
consciousness and was taken to intensive care, however, he died the next day due to disease progression. 
The last ECG done on Day 43 was normal. The event was not suspected to be study drug related.

(N=925) of ceritinib treated patients with ALK-positive NSCLC were consistent with those reported in study 
A2303 [Study A2301 SCS-Section 2.1.6.3]. 
Overall, post-baseline QTcP values >480 ms and >500 ms were observed in 52/919 patients (5.7%) and 
12/919 patients (1.3%), respectively; 58/919 patients (6.3%) had >60 ms increase from baseline [Study 
A2301 SCS Appendix 5]. 
In conclusion, the available data in Study A2303 confirm that ceritinib has a moderate QT prolonging effect, 
although no case of clinically relevant consequences has been reported. 
Importantly, no cases of ventricular arrhythmias (Torsade de pointes), and no patients with QT prolongation 
had syncope/loss of consciousness. No discontinuations due to QT prolongation, and no deaths associated 
with QT prolongation were reported. These results are consistent with previous experience and the larger 
safety pool of patients treated with ceritinib. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
Ceritinib is known to have a relevant QT prolonging effect.  
The available data in Study A2303 confirm that ceritinib has a QT prolonging effect, although no case of 
clinically relevant consequences has been reported. None of the QT prolongation AEs led to study drug 
discontinuation. There were no grade 4 QT prolongation AEs or Torsade de points, and no patients with AE 
of QT prolongation (preferred term) had syncope/loss of consciousness in Study A2303. No deaths 
associated with QT prolongation were reported.

1.  Introduction
On 7 March 2023, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Bexsero, in accordance with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion
2.1.  Information on the development program
The MAH stated that MENB REC 2ND GEN-038 (V72_72), number 205416 is a stand-alone study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study
Meningococcal Group B vaccine (rMenB+OMV NZ; Bexsero): The formulation used in the study is the 
same as the commercially available formulation. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects
2.3.1.  Introduction
The MAH submitted a final report for:
205416: A phase III, randomized, controlled, observer-blind study to demonstrate effectiveness, 
immunogenicity and safety of GSK's meningococcal Group B and combined ABCWY vaccines when 
administered to healthy adolescents and young adults.
The rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine was approved in the US under the accelerated approval regulation in 
2015. As part of the post-approval requirements set forth by the guideline, the Company was required 
to conduct post-marketing confirmatory study V72_72 to verify and describe the clinical benefit of the 
vaccine by demonstrating vaccine effectiveness using serum bactericidal assay with endogenous 
human complement (enc-hSBA). Study V72_72 for the rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine was later merged with 
the Phase 3 study, planned at that time for GSK pentavalent investigational meningococcal vaccine, 
MenABCWY, that combines the same drug substances in the same amounts as included in the licensed 
MenACWY vaccine and the licensed rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine. During the protocol negotiations with US, 
GSK was required to include 3 rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine schedules, 0,2-months, 0,6-months and 0,2,6-
months, along with the MenACWY vaccine as a control for vaccine effectiveness in the study.
Of note, Bexsero was the control vaccine for evaluation of objectives pertaining to the MenB 
component of the MenABCWY vaccine. Only results relevant to Bexsero will be described in this report.

2.3.2.  Clinical study
205416: A phase III, randomized, controlled, observer-blind study to demonstrate 
effectiveness, immunogenicity and safety of GSK's meningococcal Group B and combined 
ABCWY vaccines when administered to healthy adolescents and young adults.
Description
Methods
Study participants
The study was conducted in healthy male and female adolescents and young adults 10 to 25 years of 
age at the time of the first vaccination. 
Treatments
Participants were randomized to one of the 6 parallel study groups
 MenB_0_2_6 group: subjects received 3 doses of rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine (Bexsero) at Day 
1, Day 61 and Day 181 (0,2,6-months schedule). These subjects received 1 dose of the 
MenACWY vaccine (Menveo) at Day 211. Data from this group was used to assess both the 
0,2-months and 0,2,6-months schedules; the 0,2-months schedule was assessed 1 month 
after the second rMenB+OMV NZ vaccination administered at Day 61 (Visit 3), and the 0,2,6-
months schedule was assessed 1 month after the third rMenB+OMV NZ vaccination at Day 181 
(Visit 5), in the same group.
 MenB_0_6 group: subjects received 2 doses of rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine at Day 1 and Day 
181 and 1 dose of MenACWY vaccine at Day 61 (rMenB+OMV NZvaccine, 0,6-months 
schedule). These subjects received 1 dose of placebo at Day 211.
 ABCWY-1: subjects received 2 doses of MenABCWY vaccine 6 months apart (0,6-months 
schedule), at Day 1 and 181 with Lot 1 of the MenACWY lyophilized vial component of the 
vaccine. They received 1 dose of placebo at Day 61 and at Day 211.
 ABCWY-2: subjects received 2 doses of MenABCWY vaccine 6 months apart (0,6-months 
schedule), at Day 1 and 181 with Lot 2 of the MenACWY lyophilized vial component of the 
vaccine. They received 1 dose of placebo at Day 61 and at Day 211.
 ABCWY-3: subjects received 2 doses of MenABCWY vaccine 6 months apart (0,6-months 
schedule), at Day 1 and 181 with Lot 3 of the MenACWY lyophilized vial component of the 
vaccine. They received 1 dose of placebo at Day 61 and at Day 211.
 ACWY group: subjects received 1 dose of MenACWY vaccine at Day 1, 1 dose of placebo at 
Day 61 and 2 doses of rMenB+OMV NZ at Day 181 and Day 211
The currently approved posology for Bexsero from 11 years of age is 2 doses at least one month apart. 
Thus, the most relevant group is the second from above in the list (MnB_0_6 group).

Sample size
A total of 3657 subjects were enrolled, and 3638 subjects were randomized and received at least 1 
dose of study vaccination.
Randomisation and blinding (masking)
This was a phase III, randomized, controlled, observer-blind, multicenter, self-contained study. 
Participants were randomized (5:5:3:3:3:1 ratio, Fig.1). Data were collected in an observer-blind 
manner.  To do so, vaccine preparation and administration were done by qualified healthcare 
professional who did not participate in any of the study clinical evaluation. The serological data, which 
could have led lead to the unblinding of the study groups, were not available during the course of the 
study to any investigator or any person involved in the clinical conduct of the study or analysis.

Statistical Methods
Three thousand six hundred fifty-one (3,651) subjects were to be enrolled in the study with the 
breakdown of sample size per study arm according to the following: 
 MenB_0_2_6: 912 subjects
 MenB_0_6: 912 subjects




ABCWY-1: 548 subjects
ABCWY-2: 548 subjects
ABCWY-3: 548 subjects
ACWY: 183 subjects.
It was assumed that 25% of the subjects would drop-out. The remaining subjects who would give an 
evaluable result would provide 90% power to reject all hypothesis for the primary objectives of 
rMenB+OMV NZ and 92% power to reject all hypotheses for the primary objectives of MenABCWY 
vaccine. Additionally, the study was powered to reject key secondary objective for three N. 
meningitidis serogroup B indicator strains (96217 (NadA), M14459 (fHbp), and M13520 (NHBA)) with 
81% power. 
Immunogenicity and effectiveness methods
Serum bactericidal activity is a functional measure of the ability of antibodies, in conjunction with 
human complement, to kill meningococci, and it is widely accepted as the serological surrogate marker 
for protection.
Effectiveness of the MenB component was evaluated with serum bactericidal assays using endogenous 
source of human complement (enc-hSBA), on a panel of 110 US representative N. meningitidis 
serogroup B invasive disease strains.
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted in accordance with article 46 of 
regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended 
EMA/326330/2023 
Page 8/15
Immunogenicity of the vaccine against serogroups A, B, C, W and Y was evaluated by serum 
bactericidal assays using exogenous source of human complement (hSBAs), using indicator strains 
representing serogroups A, B, C, W and Y.
An Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), or equivalent, was used to evaluate the serotype-
specific IgG responses to A, C, W, and Y. The intent was to characterize whether the immunogenicity 
measured by hSBA using the MenA, C, W and Y indicator strains may be confounded by the 
contribution of the responses against the MenB antigens of the combination vaccine. The ELISA 
procedure was used to detect the amount of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies in response to 
specific N. meningitidis polysaccharide antigens.
Effectiveness testing by enc-hSBA and MenACWY immunogenicity testing by hSBA was prioritised over 
any other assays using exogenous source of human complement, or ELISA (or equivalent), based on 
the volume of serum available for a visit from one subject.
The methods for immunogenicity testing and estimation of effectiveness were similar to what was done 
in the studies assessed in the initial MAA, although a different strain panel and hSBA were used. The 
study report does not provide details regarding the strains used in the assays, and mostly the methods 
section of the study report refers to the study protocol. 
Results
Participant flow and numbers analysed
A total of 3657 subjects were enrolled in the study. Overall, 3638 (99.5%) subjects received at least 
one dose of study vaccine. Of these, a total of 3333 (91.6%) subjects were included in the full analysis 
set (FAS), from which a total of 2994 (89.8%) subjects were included in the per protocol set (PPS). 
The most common reasons for elimination from PPS were out of window treatment administration 
(3.5%, overall) and out of window assessment for immunogenicity (3.0%, overall). A total of 370 
subjects (10.2%) withdrew prematurely from the study. The most common reasons for premature 
withdrawal throughout the study were withdrawal of consent, not due to an (S)AE (4%, overall) and 
lost to follow-up (3.9%, overall). A total of 3619 (99.5%) and 3618 (99.5%) subjects were included in 
the Exposed Set for the Unsolicited Safety Set and Solicited Safety Set, respectively. No safety follow-
up was the reason for the elimination of a few subjects from both these sets.  
The participant flow is adequately described, and generally as expected in terms of drop-outs. 
Baseline data
Demography and baseline characteristics were comparable across study groups. 

The mean age of subjects who participated in this study was 16.5 (SD, 4.7) years across 
groups. There was a slightly higher percentage of 10–17-year-olds (59.3%) than 18–25-year-
olds (40.6%). 
 Overall, 53.5% of enrolled subjects in the study were women.


A total of 89% of subjects were of White heritage and the majority (93.7%) identified as Not 
Hispanic or Latino ethnicity.
Thirty percent of the enrolled subjects were from US and the rest of the subjects were from 
Australia, Canada, Czechia, Estonia, Finland and Turkey.

Efficacy results
Primary confirmatory objectives:
Test-based and responder-based vaccine effectiveness (VE) of rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine were 
demonstrated against a randomly selected panel of endemic US N. meningitidis serogroup B invasive 
disease strains, as assessed by the endogenous hSBA (enc-hSBA), as the LL of the 2-sided 97.5% CI 
for VE was above the pre-defined criterion of 65%, whether administered as a 2-dose (2 or 6 months 
apart), or a 3-dose schedule (at 0, 2, and 6 months) 
The estimated efficacy (97.5% CI) for each schedule were:
Test based (Per protocol set):
0, 2, 6 month schedule: 83.2% (81,9%; 84.4%)
0,6 month schedule:81.8% (80.4%;83.1%)
0,2 month schedule: 78.7% (77.2%; 80.1%)
Responder based: (Full analysis set)
0, 2, 6 month schedule: 93.4% (91.2%; 95.2%)
0,6 month schedule:89.8% (87.2%;92.0%)
0,2 month schedule: 84.8% (81.8%; 87.5%)
Secondary objectives:


At baseline, the hSBA GMTs were low in MenB and ACWY groups and increased following the 
vaccinations in all groups.
The overall percentages of subjects with 4-fold rise for serogroup B indicator strains fHbp, 
NadA, NHBA and PorA ranged from 56.5% to 98.7% for MenB_0_2_6 group (0,2,6-months 
schedule), 53.5% to 96.3% for MenB_0_2_6 group (0,2-months schedule) and 57.2% to 
95.3% for MenB_0_6 group.
The percentages of subjects with hSBA titers ≥LLOQ for serogroup B indicator strains ranged 
from 85.8% to 100% for MenB_0_2_6 group (0,2,6-months schedule), 80% to 99.5% for 
MenB_0_2_6 group (0,2-months schedule) and 82.6% to 98% for MenB_0_6 group. 
The percentages of subjects with hSBA titers ≥LLOQ for all serogroup B indicator strains 
(composite response) ranged from 75.5% to 83.3% for the rMenB+OMV NZ 3-dose and 2-
dose schedules. 
Efficacy conclusions
It is agreed that the pre-defined vaccine effectiveness endpoints were met. The results are generally in 
agreement with those in the initial MAA (Marketing Authorisation application), as well as observational 
effectiveness results. 
Safety results
Solicited AEs (7-day post-vaccination period): Pain, fatigue and headache were the most reported 
solicited AEs in the MenB_0_2_6, MenB_0_6 and ACWY groups. 

Severe (grade 3) pain was reported by 5.5% and 10.6% of subjects in the MenB_0_2_6 and 
MenB_0_6 groups, respectively and was not reported in the ACWY group.


Severe fatigue was reported by 1.2% and 2.9% of subjects in the MenB_0_2_6 and MenB_0_6 
groups, respectively and by 2.2% of subjects in ACWY group. 
Severe headache was reported by 1.1% and 2.4% of subjects in the MenB_0_2_6 and 
MenB_0_6 groups, respectively and by 2.2% of subjects in ACWY group
Most of the other solicited local and systemic AEs were mild to moderate in intensity and severe 
solicited local and systemic AEs were reported in less than 3% of subjects in MenB and ACWY groups. 
The mean duration was less than 4 days for any solicited local or systemic AE. Overall, no increase in 
the frequency of reporting of solicited AEs was observed with subsequent doses of the vaccine.
Unsolicited AEs (30-day post-vaccination period): During the 30-day follow-up period after any 
vaccination, at least one unsolicited AE was reported by 29.6% to 31.7% of subjects in MenB and 
ACWY groups.

The most commonly reported unsolicited AE after any vaccination, by preferred term (PT), was 
COVID-19 followed by upper respiratory tract infection in the MenB_0_2_6 and MenB_0_6 
groups. In ACWY group, nasopharyngitis was the most commonly reported unsolicited AE 
followed by headache and COVID-19.

Unsolicited AEs assessed as causally related to vaccination were reported by 7.4%, 6.2% and 
5.6% of subjects in the MenB_0_2_6, MenB_0_6 and ACWY groups, respectively. The most 
commonly reported causally related unsolicited AEs, by PT, was injection site induration in the 
MenB_0_2_6 group (8 subjects) and ACWY group (2 subjects). In the MenB_0_6 group, the 
most commonly reported causally related unsolicited AE, by PT, was injection site pain (8 
subjects). 
 Overall, no increase in the frequency of reporting of unsolicited AEs was observed after 
subsequent doses of the vaccine. 

SAEs (throughout the study period): A total of 20, 22 and 5 subjects reported at least 1 SAE in 
the MenB_0_2_6, MenB_0_6 and ACWY groups, respectively. There were 2 fatal events 
(poisoning [subject in MenB_0_2_6 group] and overdose in MenB_0_6 group]) in the study. 
Both these events were assessed as not causally related to vaccination by the investigator. For 
2 subjects in MenB_0_6 group, the following SAEs were assessed as causally related to 
vaccination by the investigator: nausea, vomiting, pyrexia and headache, all in 1 subject, and 
colitis ulcerative in 1 subject. 
Withdrawals due to AEs/SAEs (throughout the study period): A total of 11 subjects withdrew/were 
withdrawn from the study due to an AE (6 from MenB_0_2_6 group, 4 from MenB_0_6 group and 1 
from ACWY group). Seven subjects experienced at least one SAE that led to withdrawal from the 
study, none of these SAEs were assessed as causally related to vaccination by the investigator. Three 
of the non-serious AEs (arthritis reported in 1 subject in MenB_0_2_6 group, pyrexia and injection site 
hematoma reported in 1 subject each in MenB_0_6 group) leading to premature withdrawal were 
assessed as causally related to vaccination by the investigator. 
Other significant AEs: Two subjects reported an AESI (non-serious arthritis in 1 subject in the 
MenB_0_2_6 group which led to premature withdrawal from study and colitis ulcerative (SAE) in 1 
subject in the MenB_0_6 group). Both the AESI were classified as NOCDs and were considered as 
causally related to vaccination by the investigator.

One case of arthritis leading to premature withdrawal from the study and one case of ulcerative colitis 
were reported. Both cases were considered causally related to vaccination by the investigators. 
Narratives for the cases of arthritis and ulcerative colitis were requested to be submitted within this 
procedure to evaluate whether there was a clustering in time to onset after vaccination and if the cases 
resolved spontaneously. These cases have been submitted. No safety signal was detected.
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects
Bexsero is a vaccine used to protect individuals from the age of two months against invasive 
meningococcal disease caused by group Neisseria meningitidis. In the study MENB REC 2ND GEN-038 
(V72_72), Bexsero was the study vaccine and was also used as one of the active comparator vaccines 
to the investigational MenABCWY vaccine.
In the current study, vaccine effectiveness (test-based and responder-based) of rMenB+OMV NZ was 
evaluated against a randomly selected panel of N. meningitidis serogroup B invasive disease strains 
(110-MenB strain panel), administered as a 2-dose (2- or 6-months apart), or as a 3-dose (at 0, 2, 
and 6 months) schedule. All 3 schedules met the pre-defined criterion for success (LL of the 2-sided 
97.5% CI for VE >65%) for both effectiveness endpoints, showing that rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine, 
whether administered as a 2-dose, or a 3-dose schedule is effective against disease causing MenB 
strains. The rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine was generally well tolerated in the study. The safety results were 
generally found to be in line with the established safety profile of the rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine, 
irrespective of the dosing schedule. However, narratives for one case of arthritis and one case of 
ulcerative colitis should be submitted, along with a discussion on the relevance of these cases.

Arthritis
Summary of the case
A case of arthritis was reported by a 24-year-old male subject who was enrolled in
study MENB REC 2ND GEN-038 (V72_72). The subject received the first dose of the study vaccine

regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended 
EMA/326330/2023

(rMenB + OMV NZ) on 2021 and the second dose of the study vaccine (rMenB+OMV NZ) two months 
after. 10 days after receiving the first dose of the study vaccine, the subject had pain in the left 
metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint of the fourth toe, fluctuating swelling and redness of the joint; there 
were no symptoms in the other joints. According to the subject, there was no trauma. Two months 
after laboratory tests were performed due to these symptoms, showing leukocytopenia and 
lymphocytopenia. The left foot x-ray was normal while the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed 
signs of arthritis, mild subluxation of the joint, hydrops and synovitis in the joint and reactive edema in 
the surroundings. A month after, human leukocyte antigen B27 (HLA- B*27) assay result was positive 
and Monoarthritis (Grade 2, moderate) was diagnosed. The event was considered non serious. Onset 
or relation to previous exercise could not be verified from site
source documents; anamnesis states that there was no atypical physical exertion before. The etiology 
of the subluxation and inflammation captured by the MRI at the involved joint is unknown and could
be either secondary to arthritis or previous trauma and instability. The subject was treated with
cortisone and etoricoxib. The outcome of the event was reported as resolved 4 months after the first 
dose. The administration of study vaccine was discontinued due to the event.
Investigator’s assessment
The event of arthritis was assessed by the investigator as non-serious adverse event of special interest
(AESI). In the opinion of the investigator, the arthritis was considered related to the study vaccine.
Company medical assessment
The company considers that there is insufficient evidence to conclude on the causal association
between the event “arthritis” and rMenB+OMV NZ. The aetiology of the subluxation and
inflammation captured by the MRI is unknown and according to radiologist's evaluation it could be
due to arthritis or previous unperceived trauma and instability. Moreover, the time-to-onset (TTO)
seems to be biologically implausible (i.e., too short) for a possible vaccine-induced possible immune-
mediated disorder (pIMD). It is worth mentioning that arthritis constitutes an important potential risk 
for Bexsero in the European Union Risk Management Plan (EU-RMP) and Periodic Benefit-Risk 
Evaluation Report (PBRER). Events of arthritis are monitored through the AESI collection in the 
Bexsero clinical trials. As part of the risk mitigation strategies, GSK has developed an ad hoc eCRF 
page to further characterize this risk. The investigators are asked to compile the ad hoc eCRF page and 
to report the events of arthritis to GSK within 24 hours (regardless of the seriousness of the event). 
Cases of arthritis are also monitored as part of routine pharmacovigilance (PV) activities which include 
the use of a targeted follow up questionnaire for the collection of information from spontaneous 
sources and the periodic monitoring through PBRER. Based on the available data, no safety issue 
relating to this important potential risk is identified. The Company will continue to closely monitor 
arthritis through routine PV.
Assessor's comment:
The patient was positive for HLA-B27, which is known to be associated with reactive arthritis. A 
causal relationship between vaccination and arthritis therefore not be established. The arthritis was 
assessed as a non-serious and resolved during the reporting period. 
Ulcerative colitis
Summary of the case
A case of ulcerative colitis was reported by a 25-year-old male subject who was enrolled in study MENB 
REC 2ND GEN-038 (V72_72). The subject received the first vaccination (rMenB+OMV NZ) on 2020, the 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted in accordance with article 46 of 
regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended

second vaccination (MenACWY) two months after, the third vaccination (rMenB+OMV NZ) six months 
after and the fourth injection (Placebo) seven months after. The subjects concurrent medical condition 
included dislocation and subluxury of shoulder joint. Family medical history included Crohn’s disease. 
The subject’s concomitant medication included tozinameran ([Covid-19 Vaccine]), esomeprazole 
magnesium, proctosedyl nos (l) and citric acid, magnesium oxide, picosulfuric acid sodium. Five 
months after the first dose, the subject experienced bloody diarrhea, loss of weight, fatigue and 
anorexia. Stool analysis result was positive. 44 days after receiving the third vaccination, the subject 
was diagnosed with colitis ulcerative (Grade 3, severe), as diagnosed through rectoscopy, colonoscopy 
and abdominal biopsy. The event was considered serious as it required hospitalization and clinically 
significant/intervention. Blood iron result was 3.7 mmol/L (normal range: 11.6 to 31) and hemoglobin 
(Hb) result was 117 g (normal range 134 to 170). The subject was hospitalized: CRP 25.7, leucocytes 
10.7*10/9/l, Hgb 109g/l. Colonoscopy showed left side colitis, high activity, pseudo polyposis, ulcers, 
crypt abscesses.
The subject received intravenous infusion of Prednisolon 75mg. Four days after hospitalization, the 
subject was discharged from the hospital. The subject was treated with azathioprine, pantoprazole, 
metronidazole, prednisolone, sodium chloride, iron polymaltose, esomeprazole magnesium , 
metronidazole, ciprofloxacin , budenoside, and mesalazine .
106 days after receiving the third vaccination), colonoscopy morphology showed active chronic 
inflammation coli, foci destructions and granulations, crypt abscesses. Given the chronic nature of the 
ulcerative colitis, the outcome of the event was reported as not resolved at the time of this report.
Investigator’s assessment
The event of colitis ulcerative was assessed by the investigator as serious pIMD. In the opinion of the
investigator, the colitis ulcerative was considered related to the study vaccine.
Company medical assessment
The company considers that there is insufficient evidence to conclude on the causal association
between the event “colitis ulcerative” and rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine as the concomitant
administration of the Covid -19 vaccine and the positive family history of Crohn’s disease (patient’s
sister) represent confounding risk factors. Events of ulcerative colitis are monitored through pIMDs 
collection, as part of AESI collection in the Bexsero clinical trials. A non-exhaustive list of pIMDs is 
included in the protocols of Bexsero trials; the investigator may exercise his/her medical and scientific 
judgement in deciding whether other diseases have an autoimmune origin. For these events the 
investigator is asked to compile an ad hoc eCRF page and to report the events to GSK within 24 hours 
(regardless of the seriousness of the event). A continuous update on pIMD cases following Bexsero 
vaccination is provided by the company to Health Authorities through periodic pharmacovigilance 
reports (i.e., DSUR). From the review of the most up-to-date available information, as reported in the 
latest DSUR (reporting period 14 Jan 2022-13 Jan 2023), no safety issue was identified and the 
previously established favourable benefit-risk profile for Bexsero remains unchanged. Cases of pIMDs 
will continue to be monitored as part of routine PV.

Assessor's comment:
One patient was reported with ulcerative colitis. The condition was assessed as serious by the 
investigator. The patient also received Comirnaty in conjunction with Bexero vaccination. An 
association between Comirnaty and inflammatory bowel disease has not been established. The 
patient did report a family history of IBD. A causal relationship between Bexero vaccination and 
ulcerative colitis cannot therefore be established.

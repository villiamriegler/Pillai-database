1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Blueprint Medicines (Netherlands) B.V. submitted on 1 July 2019 an application for 
marketing authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Avapritinib Blueprint Medicines, 
through the centralised procedure falling within the Article 3(1) and point 4 of Annex of Regulation 
(EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 
18 October 2018 -  
Avapritinib Blueprint Medicines, was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/17/1889 on 17 
July 2017 in the following condition: Treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumours. 
The  applicant  applied  for  the  following  indication  “treatment  of  adult  patients  with  unresectable  or 
metastatic GIST who have been treated with at least 3 prior lines of therapy” and “treatment of adult 
patients with unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) harbouring the platelet-
derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) D842V mutation, regardless of prior therapy.” 
The name of Avapritinib Blueprint Medicines was changed to Ayvakyt during the procedure. Reference 
of both names appear throughout the assessment. 
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan 
Medicinal Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Ayvakyt as an orphan medicinal product in the 
approved indication. More information on the COMP’s review can be found in the Orphan maintenance 
assessment report published under the ‘Assessment history’ tab on the Agency’s website: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/ayvakyt. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0026/2019 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0026/2019 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The intended indication is:  
“treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST who have been treated with at least 
3 prior lines of therapy” And “treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic 
gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) harbouring the platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha 
(PDGFRA) D842V mutation, regardless of prior therapy.” 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Gastrointestinal stromal tumour is a rare sarcoma that arises from the interstitial cells of Cajal and 
occurs throughout the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (Miettinen and Lasota, 2006; Rammohan et al, 2013). 
Gastrointestinal stromal tumour is most commonly diagnosed between the ages of 50 and 80 years 
and represents approximately 0.1% to 3.0% of all GI malignancies (Nilsson et al, 2005).  
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
More than 85% of patients with GIST have an oncogenic KIT (~75% of cases), or PDGFRA (~10% of 
cases) mutation that drives tumour growth (Antonescu, 2011). While patients with metastatic GIST 
clearly benefit from imatinib and may derive some benefit with other available TKIs, as described 
above; this advantage is limited to patients with KIT-mutant GIST. Importantly, patients with disease 
bearing the PDGFRA D842V [substitution of aspartic acid with valine at 842 position] mutation typically 
do not obtain clinical benefit with any of the approved therapies, including imatinib, and the degree of 
activity in patients with disease bearing other mutations in exon 18 of PDGFRA, which encodes the 
activation loop, is uncertain, as these mutations are very rare. 
Assessment report  
EMA/451735/2020  
Page 10/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Primary  and  acquired  KIT  and  PDGFRA  resistance  mutations  (Figure  2)  appear  closely  linked  with 
therapeutic  failure  in  advanced  GIST.  The  presence  of  mutations  in  specific  regions  of  the  KIT  and 
PDGFRA genes are correlated with response (or lack of response) to specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors 
(NCCN,  2018).  Acquired  resistance  occurs  after  initial  response  or  disease  stabilization  in  KIT-driven 
GIST  and  relates  to  acquisition  of  a  second  mutation  that  impairs  binding  of  approved  TKIs. 
Acquired/secondary resistance mutations involving the adenosine triphosphate binding pocket (exons 13 
and 14) and activation loop (exons 17 and 18) of KIT are common (Heinrich et al, 2008). Activation loop 
mutations  accumulate  with  increasing  frequency  after  second-line  therapy  (sunitinib),  which  also  has 
inadequate activity on activation loop mutant proteins (Heinrich et al, 2008; Liegl et al, 2008). By fourth 
line  therapy,  multiple  resistance  mutations  are  often  present,  and  no  agents  have  demonstrated 
significant clinical activity. Primary resistance due to mutation in the PDGFRA activation loop, particularly 
the D842V mutation occurs in 5-6% of patients with advanced GIST.  
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
Some GISTs are asymptomatic and are discovered incidentally during an endoscopic study (where they 
typically present as subepithelial masses) or on cross-sectional imaging done for another purpose. 
More often, they are associated with nonspecific symptoms (ie, early satiety, bloating), unless they 
ulcerate, bleed, or grow large enough to cause pain or obstruction. 
The median overall survival (OS) in patients with metastatic disease decreases quickly with multiple 
lines of therapy from 7 to 8 years after starting initial treatment for metastatic disease to only 1.4 
years after starting treatment with fourth line therapy (Life Raft Group Patient Registry; data on file). 
The short survival may account for the fact that only about 50% of patients receive treatment with a 
second line of therapy. Imatinib is the clear standard of care for first-line therapy being used in about 
85% of patients seeking first-line treatment for metastatic disease. Sunitinib is the most commonly 
used agent in the second-line setting, with utilization in approximately 50% of patients; however, 
approximately 15% of patients still receive imatinib at different doses in the second-line setting. In the 
third-line setting, regorafenib is used in approximately 45% of patients. These data indicate that 
although sunitinib and regorafenib are approved for second- and third-line treatment, respectively, 
Assessment report  
EMA/451735/2020  
Page 11/144 
 
 
 
 
neither is used in the majority of patients, and there is no dominant standard of care or preferred 
treatment regimen after first-line therapy with imatinib (Kantar Health 2018). This is consistent with 
the low response rates and short PFS seen with these agents. 
2.1.5.  Management 
For  localized,  potentially  resectable  disease,  initial  treatment  includes  surgery,  followed  by  adjuvant 
therapy with imatinib for patients with increased risk of recurrence due to poor prognostic factors, such 
as high mitotic index and large tumour size (NCCN, 2018). As chemotherapy and radiation are ineffective, 
the current treatment paradigm (Figure 1) for advanced GIST involves sequential administration of the 
tyrosine  kinase  inhibitors  (TKIs),  imatinib,  sunitinib,  and  regorafenib  (Antonescu,  2011;  Casali  et  al, 
2018; NCCN, 2018). First-line treatment with imatinib is effective with a 60% response rate and median 
progression free survival (PFS) of 18 to 24 months (Demetri et al, 2002; Blanke et al, 2008). Subsequent 
treatment with sunitinib and regorafenib is markedly less effective with a response rate of 5% to 7%, 
and a median PFS of 5-6 months. Once patients experience progressive disease (PD) following treatment 
with imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib, no agents are effective; therefore, the National Comprehensive 
Cancer  Network  and  European  Society  for  Medical  Oncology  guidelines  recommend  a  clinical  trial  or 
palliative care for fourth-line patients (Casali et al, 2018; ESMO, 2018; NCCN, 2018). For example, in a 
randomized study imatinib re-treatment in the third or fourth-line setting resulted in an overall response 
rate (ORR) of zero and a median PFS of 1.8 months compared to 0.9 months for placebo (Kang et al, 
2013). Therefore, there remains a high medical need for the development of novel therapies for fourth-
line  patients  with  GIST.  The  D842V  mutation  is  insensitive  to  imatinib  and  other  approved  agents 
(Heinrich et al, 2003a; Cassier et al, 2012), which rarely induce response, and provide a median PFS of 
only 3 to 5 months, OS of approximately 15 months (Cassier et al, 2012; Yoo et al, 2016). 
About the product 
All  oncogenic  kinases  signal  via  the  active  conformation  of  the  kinase.  Avapritinib  is  a  Type  1  kinase 
inhibitor designed to potently and selectively inhibit oncogenic KIT and PDGFRA mutants by targeting 
the active conformation of the kinase. Avapritinib shows broad inhibitory activity against both primary 
and secondary KIT and PDGFRA mutants with most potent activity against activation loop mutants, which 
approved therapies do not inhibit. Based on nonclinical models, exposures achieved in the clinical studies 
are  projected  to  be  active  across  a  broad  range  of  mutations  seen  in  patients  with  GIST.  Avapritinib 
Assessment report

shows marked selectivity for KIT and PDGFRA within the kinome, as demonstrated via comprehensive 
kinome screening. 
The indication approved by the CHMP is:  
Ayvakyt is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic 
gastrointestinal  stromal  tumours  (GIST)  harbouring  the  platelet-derived  growth  factor  receptor  alpha 
(PDGFRA) D842V mutation.  
Therapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the administration of anticancer therapy. 
Patient  selection  for  treatment  of  unresectable  or  metastatic  GIST  harbouring  the  PDGFRA  D842V 
mutation should be based on a validated test method. The recommended starting dose of avapritinib is 
300 mg  orally  once  daily,  on  an  empty  stomach.  The  dose  should  be  adjusted  based  on  safety  and 
tolerability 
Treatment should be continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
Concomitant  use  of  avapritinib  with  strong  or  moderate  CYP3A  inhibitors  should  be  avoided.  If 
concomitant  use  with  a  moderate  CYP3A  inhibitor  cannot  be  avoided,  the  starting  dose  of  avapritinib 
should be reduced from 300 mg orally once daily to 100 mg orally once daily (see section 4.5 of the 
SmPC). 
If vomiting occurs after taking a dose of avapritinib, the patient should not take an additional dose but 
continue with the next scheduled dose. 
If  a  dose  of  avapritinib  is  missed,  the  patient  should  make  up  for  the  missed  dose  unless  the  next 
scheduled dose is within 8 hours (see Method of administration of the SmPC). If the dose has not been 
taken at least 8 hours prior to the next dose, then that dose should be omitted and the patient should

Type of Application and aspects on development 
The  applicant  requested  consideration  of  its  application  intended  for  the  treatment  of  gastrointestinal 
stromal tumor, a life threatening disease, for a Conditional Marketing Authorisation in accordance with 
Article 14-a of the above mentioned Regulation, based on the following criteria: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive. 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data. The Applicant claims that 
for both populations included in the intended indication, longer term follow-up data from the 
Phase 1 study BLU-285-1101 would be available and were planned to be submitted during the 
evaluation. In addition, a confirmatory Phase 3 randomized controlled study BLU-285-1303 is 
currently ongoing. The study is designed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of avapritinib 
compared to regorafenib in patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic GIST 
previously treated with at least 2 TKIs including imatinib (3L and 4L). Approximately 5% of 
patients (n=20) in the confirmatory study are expected to carry the D842V mutation.  
Unmet medical needs will be addressed, as there are no approved and appropriate therapies for 
patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST harboring the PDGFRA D842V mutation nor for 
the 4L+ GIST patients who are at their last line of therapy. 
 The benefits to public health of the immediate availability of avapritinib outweigh the risks 
inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. The Applicant claims that the overall 
safety profile consistent with inhibition of KIT and PDGFRA, oral kinase inhibitors in general, 
and underlying disease and the unprecedented activity observed in the PDGFRA D842V-mutant 
GIST population and significant activity in the 4L+ population, immediate availability of 
avapritinib, outweighs the risk to wait until the confirmatory data are fully available.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of avapritinib is (S)-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1-(2-(4-(6-(1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-
yl)pyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazin-4-yl)piperazin-1-yl)pyrimidin-5-yl)ethan-1-amine corresponding to the 
molecular formula C26H27FN10 has a relative molecular mass of 498.57 g/mol  and the following 
structure: 
Figure 1: Active substance structure 
The chemical structure of active substance was elucidated by a combination of single crystal X-ray 
crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), mass spectrometry (MS), elemental 
analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy 
(UV). The solid state properties of the active substance were measured by XRPD. 
The active substance is a non-hygroscopic white to off-white to light yellow solid, practically insoluble 
in water and slightly or very slightly soluble in buffer solutions of pH 1 to 5. At higher pHs the solubility 
of the molecule decreases. Avapritinib is very soluble in acetonitrile and methanol. 
Avapritinib contains a single asymmetrically substituted tetrahedral carbon of the ‘S’ absolute 
configuration. 
Polymorphism has been observed for the active substance. Two polymorphs have been observed, Form 
A is the polymorph which is manufactured consistently using the commercial process and is the form 
that was used exclusively throughout the development process. Form A is also the thermodynamically 
stable form. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is manufactured in one manufacturing site. 
Avapritinib is manufactured via a convergent route, sub-divided into three major process steps using 
commercially available well-defined starting materials with acceptable specifications.  
Assessment report  
EMA/451735/2020  
Page 15/144 
 
 
 
 
 
The manufacturing process consists of three starting materials. There are multiple isolated 
intermediates, the manufacturing process uses multiple purifications including precipitations, organic-
aqueous extractions, crystallizations, recrystallizations, and triturations to generate a highly pure 
active substance. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. Acceptable information on impurities (covering starting 
materials, intermediates, reagents, catalysts, solvents, and other related potential impurities arising 
from the synthesis) and the proposed control strategy for these impurities have been provided. The 
identified impurities are limited either through the starting materials and intermediates specifications 
or by in-process controls. The active substance is intended for cancer therapy, so is outside of the 
scope of ICH M7. Nevertheless, the presence of potential genotoxic impurities arising from the active 
substance manufacture has been addressed. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with 
regards to their origin and characterised. 
The  development  history  of  the  active  substance  has  been  described.  Throughout  development, 
avapritinib  has  been  produced  by  two  different  multi-step,  convergent  synthetic  routes.  The  process 
development  studies  for  each  step  of  the  manufacturing  process  included  laboratory  experiments 
performed to optimise reaction and isolation conditions. Spike, fate, and purge studies that demonstrated 
the capability of the manufacturing process to remove the impurities were also performed. A combination 
of both traditional (one-variable-at-a-time, OVAT) and multi-variate process mapping studies (DoE) were 
conducted to identify critical process parameters during development. Parameters included in the process 
mapping studies were those identified (in a prior risk analysis) as presenting potential risks to the critical 
material attributes (CMAs) or active substance CQAs. Interaction effects within different PARs have been 
analysed. In order to support the designation of PARs and CPPs confirmatory runs (at manufacture scale) 
were carried out. No design space is claimed. 
The active substance is packaged in LDPE bags which complies with the Regulation (EU) 10/2011. The 
LDPE bags are closed with cable ties (with one bag inside the other) and placed into a HDPE secondary 
container.  
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for description (visual), identity (FTIR, HPLC), assay 
(HPLC), impurities (HPLC), chiral impurity (chiral HPLC) residual solvents (HS-GS), residual 
diisopropylethylamine (GC), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), solid form confirmation (PXRD), and particle 
size distribution (laser diffraction). 
Impurities are controlled in accordance with ICH Q3A and Q6A.  A single impurity present at higher 
than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by toxicological and clinical studies 
and appropriate specifications have been set 
An assessment of the manufacturing process for avapritinib active substance concludes that the risk 
for the presence of nitrosamines impurities is low in the current manufacturing process. There are no 
recommended process or analytical method changes required to further mitigate this risk. 
Water content is not included in the active substance specification as the active substance is non-
hygroscopic. A review of the available microbial enumeration data alongside results from water activity 
testing and the lack of hygroscopicity of avapritinib indicates that the amount of water available in the 
active substance is insufficient to support the growth of microorganisms and therefore the risk of 
microbial contamination is low, therefore microbial enumeration is not part if the commercial 
specification of the active substance. Class 1 and 2A elements (Cd, Pb, As, Hg, Co, V, and Ni) are not

used in the avapritinib manufacturing process. Based on release data from avapritinib clinical batches 
and upstream control of metals used in manufacturing process, elemental impurities testing is not 
included in the commercial specification. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data 26 pilot and commercial scale batches of the active substance are provided. The 
results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from 3 pilot scale batches of active substance from the  manufacturer stored in the 
intended commercial package for up to 24 months under long term conditions (25ºC / 60% RH) and 
for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were 
provided.  
In addition, supportive stability data is provided in one batch manufactured prior to implementation of 
optimised recrystallisation step through 36 months and 6 months at the long term and accelerated 
storage conditions, respectively. 
The parameters included in the stability program and their acceptance criteria are the same as those 
used for release testing. In addition, water content and microbial enumeration are tested during 
stability studies. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability 
indicating. Results from stability studies under long term and accelerated stability conditions show no 
changes in any of the parameters tested. 
Stress study results demonstrated sensitivity to oxidative and acidic stress conditions, however, the 
finished product is stable.  
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. No significant 
degradation was observed after exposure to light stress. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period, when stored at 15 - 25°C in 
the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is an immediate release tablet for oral administration. It is a white film-coated 
tablet, printed in blue ink with “BLU” on one side and the tablet strength on the other side. 
All tablet strengths are manufactured using a common blend and are therefore quantitatively 
proportional in active substance and excipient content.  
The active substance has low solubility and high permeability and is classified as a Biopharmaceutical 
Classification System (BCS) Class 2 based on criteria for solubility and intestinal permeability in the 
ICH M9 Guideline Biopharmaceutics Classification System-based Biowaivers. Avapritinib is slightly 
soluble to practically insoluble in aqueous media. Avapritinib shows polymorphism, Form A being the 
most thermodynamically stable form. Solid Form A is used for the finished product manufacturing. 
Assessment report  
EMA/451735/2020

Compatibility studies were undertaken to assess the compatibility of the active substance with a range 
of commonly used pharmaceutical excipients. The data obtained were used to aid selection of 
appropriate excipients during formulation development.  The excipients compatibility study was 
designed to focus on excipients that are commonly used in dry granulation, immediate release tablet 
formulations. Binary blends of avapritinib and the excipients were prepared and stored at 60°C/75% 
RH through 4 weeks. After chemical and manufacturability assessments were completed, the excipients 
selected for the finished product were microcrystalline cellulose (diluent), copovidone (binder), 
croscarmellose sodium (disintegrant), magnesium stearate (lubricant) and Opadry II (film-coat). 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
Based on the clinical development program, a solid oral dosage form was the starting point and initial 
objective  of  pharmaceutical  development  for  the  finished  product.  The  quality  target  product  profile 
(QTPP) was an integral part of the development process that expanded on the initial objective to guide 
the selection and optimisation of desirable attributes and quality targets for the finished product. The 
QTPP connects the desired product attributes with specific development targets and then links them to 
the resulting qualities of the intended commercial product.  
Potential finished product critical quality attributes (CQA) have been derived from the QTPP and/or prior 
knowledge  to  design  a  quality  product  and  a  manufacturing  process  which  consistently  delivers  the 
intended  performance  of  the  product.  The  preliminary  identification  of  finished  product  CQAs  was 
performed  with  consideration  for  relevant  quality  attributes  of  the  finished  product  components  (e.g. 
active substance), process development studies, and process knowledge based on previous experience. 
In  addition,  ICH  Harmonised  Guidelines  Q8  (R2),  Q9  and  Q10  were  used  as  benchmarks  to  guide 
development with the aim of enabling continuous improvement in the context of a lifecycle approach to 
product development and process validation.  
Based  on  these  assessments,  the  following  qualities  were  identified  as  potentially  critical  to  finished 
product:  description,  identification,  assay,  degradants,  uniformity  of  dosage  units,  moisture  content, 
dissolution,  and  microbial  purity.  These  attributes  were  selected  in  accordance  with  ICH  Q6A 
Specifications:  Test  Procedures  and  Acceptance  Criteria  for  New  Drug  Substances  and  New  Drug 
Products:  Chemical  Substances,  including  consideration  of  analytical  and  manufacturing  capabilities, 
desired product quality attributes, and intended product performance with regard to safety and efficacy. 
All finished product CQAs were monitored by means of a comprehensive control strategy that includes 
process design and validated methods for process inputs, in-process controls and final product release 
tests. 
The development of the dissolution method was described. The data provided confirm that the method 
is able to discriminate between batches showing differences in those parameters/attributes.  
The  finished  product is  manufactured using  a  common  blend  which  is  prepared  through intragranular 
blending  of  diluent,  binder,  disintegrant  and  lubricant,  followed  by  dry  granulation  using  roller 
compaction and then extragranular blending with diluent, disintegrant and lubricant. The common blend 
is compressed into the different tablet strengths that are then aesthetically film-coated and printed with 
a unique identifier for each tablet strength.  
The  initial  tablets  were  manufactured  in  one  manufacturing  site.  The  manufacturing  process  was 
transferred  to  the  manufacturing  site  of  the  commercial  finished  product.  The  manufacturing  process 
flow  remained  unchanged  and  the  equipment  was  similar  with  some  exceptions.  During  the 
manufacturing  process  transfer,  the  data  from  in-process  testing  and  release  testing  was  used  to 
determine if the tablets manufactured by both manufacturers were comparable.  
Assessment report  
EMA/451735/2020  
Page 18/144 
 
 
 
Characterisation and optimisation studies were performed to ensure that the process was suitably robust 
and well-controlled prior to validation. After the completion of the process transfer, the manufacturing 
process  was  evaluated  from  a  technical  perspective  before  manufacturing  the  registration  batches. 
Observations from the process transfer and the results of the technical risk assessment were used to 
design experiments to further optimise the process. The details of each unit operation were considered 
along  with  the  QTPP,  and  the  manufacturing  process  was  evaluated  to  identify  potential  risk  to  drug 
product CQAs. A FMEA based approach with a defined process was used to rank all potential risks for 
each unit operation. The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the finished product 
and the manufacturing process. However, the process description is traditional, and no design space was 
claimed for the manufacturing process of the finished product.  
The  primary  packaging  is  high-density  polyethylene  (HDPE)  bottle  with  child-resistant  cap  with  foiled 
induction seal liner and a desiccant in canister. The material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. 
The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the 
intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
All three tablet strengths are dose-weight proportional and are manufactured using a common blend. 
The manufacturing process of avapritinib tablets consists of 6 main steps. The process is considered to 
be a standard manufacturing process 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing 
process. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process. 
Product specification  
The finished product release and stability specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage 
form: appearance (visual), identity (FTIR, HPLC), assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), content 
uniformity (Ph. Eur.), dissolution (Ph. Eur.), water content (KF), and microbial enumeration (Ph. Eur.). 
Degradants were evaluated according to procedures described in ICH Q6A.  
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. In compliance with ICH 
Q3D, all Class 1 and 2A elements and intentionally added or those with the potential to be present 
were considered in the risk assessment. The risk assessment has concluded that the potential risk of 
elemental impurities in the finished product is low and no additional controls are required to further 
minimize this risk. 
In the context of the on-going review under Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 related to the 
potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products applicants were requested by 
CHMP  to  review  their  products  for  potential  presence  of  nitrosamine  impurities  and  to  conduct  risk 
evaluations/risk  assessments  as  appropriate.    Risk  assessments  from  the  suppliers  of  the  active 
substances, excipients and finished product manufacturer were provided. Based on the risk assessments 
provided, a risk for nitrosamine formation can be excluded.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for testing has been presented.

Batch analysis results are provided for 23 commercial and pilot scale batches confirming the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product 
specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability  data  from  3  pilot  scale  batches  of  finished  product  for  100  mg  and  400  mg  tablet  strengths 
stored for up to 24 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under 
accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of 
medicinal  product  are  identical  to  those  proposed  for  marketing  and  were  packed  in  the  primary 
packaging proposed for marketing.  
Four strengths (100 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg and 400 mg) of the finished product were developed initially, 
although only 100 mg, 200 mg and 300 mg strengths will be authorised / marketed. Since all strengths 
are dose-weight proportional, manufactured with a common blend and the container closure system and 
units per container are the same across all strengths, a bracketing design has been applied in which the 
100 mg and 400 mg represent the extremes of the design, i.e. 100 mg and 400 mg are placed on formal 
stability studies where the intermediate strengths (i.e. 200 mg and 300 mg) are considered bracketed. 
Taking into account the principles defined in the ICH Q1D guideline, the proposed bracketing design is 
acceptable. The fact that the 400 mg strength will not be commercialised does not impact the validity of 
the proposed design. In addition, the applicant commits to place production batches of the marketed 
extremes (i.e. 100 mg and 300 mg) on stability studies post-approval. 
In addition to the parameters included in the product specifications, enantiomer impurity, hardness, and 
solid form are tested in the stability studies. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. All 
the stability results comply with the proposed specifications.  
A photostability study using Option 2 as described in ICH Q1B was performed on two batches (100 mg 
and 400 mg strength). The photostability data shows that the finished product is not sensitive to light. 
A simulated in-use study was initiated for the 100 mg and 300 mg strengths to study the effect of use 
of  the  product  in  practice  via  opening  and  closing  the  bottle  daily  at  15.0  –  25.0°C  over  75  days. 
Negligible  change  was  seen  in  assay,  moisture,  and  dissolution  results.  No  degradant  growth  was 
detected. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months without special storage 
conditions as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the active substance and finished 
product and their manufacturing process. However, no design spaces were claimed for the 
manufacturing process of the active substance, nor for the finished product.

Not applicable 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
In vivo and in vitro studies were submitted, additionally toxicology studies were also presented. 
Avapritinib showed broad inhibitory activity against a panel of GIST relevant KIT and PDGFRα mutant 
enzymes including the KIT exon 11 mutants found in >60% of newly diagnosed GIST, all KIT exon 17 
and 18 mutants tested and all PDGFRα exon 18 mutants tested. While potent on these KIT and 
PDGFRα mutants, avapritinib was demonstrated to be selective against a panel of 456 human kinases 
and disease-relevant mutants.  
Avapritinib demonstrated inhibition of KIT and PDGFRα mutant activity in the cellular setting and 
efficacy in some KIT mutant-driven mouse xenograft models. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Inhibition of KIT and PDGFRα Mutants In Vitro 
Avapritinib has demonstrated biochemical in vitro activity on KIT exon 17 mutant enzymes including KIT 
D816V  (IC50=  0.27  nM)  and  PDGFRα  exon  18  mutant  enzymes  including  D842V  (IC50=  0.24  nM). 
Imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib, all approved to treat patients with GIST, were over 400-fold less 
potent against these clinically relevant mutations (Table 1). 
Table 1. Biochemical activity of avapritinib and approved GIST agents against KIT D816V and PDGFRα 
D842V Mutants 
Further  biochemical  testing  against  a  panel  of  GIST  relevant  KIT  and  PDGFRα  mutant  enzymes 
demonstrated avapritinib was potent against all KIT mutants tested, with subnanomolar IC50 on KIT exon

11, 17 and 18 mutants (Table 2). In addition, avapritinib demonstrated potent subnanomolar activity 
against all PDGFRα exon 18 mutants tested (Table 2). 
Table 2: Biochemical Activity of Avapritinib and Imatinib Against a Panel of GIST relevant mutants 
The selectivity of avapritinib was characterized by profiling its binding across a panel of over 450 human 
kinases and disease-relevant kinase mutants at 3 μM. Avapritinib had a high degree of selectivity for the 
KIT  exon  11,  13  and  17  mutant  proteins  in  this  assay.  As  a  control,  four  reference  compounds  were 
included in the study and the obtained data were comparable to historic percent of control values for 
each reference control in all 456 assays. 
The dissociation constant (Kd) was determined for wild-type kinases that avapritinib significantly bound 
(i.e., < 10% of control) in the human kinome screen. Measurement of Kd demonstrated that in addition 
to the KIT exon 17 mutants (KIT D816V Kd= 0.3 nM, KIT D816H Kd= 0.4 nM), avapritinib demonstrated 
binding  affinity  for  the  small  group  of  highly  related  class  III  receptor  tyrosine  kinases  to  which  KIT 
belongs:  KIT  wild  type  (Kd=  17  nM),  PDGFRα  wild  type  (Kd=  1  nM),  platelet-derived  growth  factor 
receptor beta (PDGFRβ) (Kd= 1 nM), colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) (Kd= 6 nM) and Fms-
like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) (Kd= 31 nM). All other kinases demonstrated Kd greater than 50 nM. These 
data demonstrate that avapritinib has limited potential for kinome activity outside of the related class 
III receptor tyrosine kinases.  
Avapritinib cellular activity was measured by inhibition of KIT exon 17 mutant autophosphorylation and 
inhibition  of  cellular  proliferation.  In  the  human  mast  cell  leukemia  (MCL)  cell  line  HMC1.2,  which 
harbours  an  activated  KIT  exon  11/exon  17  (V560G/D816V)  mutant  kinase,  treatment  with  low 
nanomolar  concentrations  of  avapritinib  potently  inhibited  the  KIT  V560G/D816V  mutant  protein 
measured by both AlphaLISA® and immunoblotting (IC50=4.0 nM). Avapritinib antiproliferative activity 
was also demonstrated in this KIT mutant dependent cell line (IC50= 125 nM). In P815 cells, a mouse

mastocytoma cell line driven by a KIT exon 17 mutation (mouse KIT D814Y) equivalent to the human 
KIT D816Y mutation, avapritinib potently inhibited signalling of mutant KIT measured by inhibition of 
KIT  autophosphorylation  (IC50=  22  nM)  or  cellular  proliferation  (IC50=  202  nM)  and  induced  caspase 
activation (half maximal effective concentration [EC50=36 nM]), indicating apoptosis was induced with 
avapritinib.  Consistent  with  the  selectivity  observed  in  biochemical  binding  and  enzymatic  assays, 
avapritinib inhibited SCF-stimulated KIT wild type activity in M-07e cells less potently as measured by 
KIT autophosphorylation with IC50= 192 nM (Figure 1), compared to the autophosphorylation IC50= 4 
and  22  nM  in  the  KIT  exon  17  mutant  cell  lines  HMC1.2  and  P815  cells,  respectively.  Inhibition  of 
proliferation in the non-stem cell factor/KIT-driven cell line UT7 grown in the presence of granulocyte-
macrophage  colony-stimulating 
factor  (GM-CSF)  demonstrated  avapritinib 
lacked  nonspecific 
antiproliferative activity and was not broadly cytotoxic.

The circulating metabolite M499, formed by oxidative deamination of avapritinib, has been shown to be 
pharmacologically active. Compared to avapritinib (IC50=4 nM), the (S) - and (R) - enantiomers of M499 
(BLU-111208; IC50=12.4 nM and BLU-111207; IC50=41.8 nM) are 3.1- and 10.5-fold less potent against 
KIT D816V in HMC1.2 cell assay. Metabolites M484 (formed by N-demethylation) and M485 (formed by 
oxidative deamination, N-demethylation) also demonstrated activity against KIT D816V. The IC50 values 
for M484 and the (S) - and (R)-enantiomers of M485 were 7.1, 16.1 and 94.5 nM, respectively.  
KIT  and  PDGFRα  are  2  highly-related  class  III  receptor  tyrosine  kinases.  The  KIT  exon  17  D816V 
activating mutation occurs at the same amino acid position structurally as the PDGFRα exon 18 D842V 
mutation  that  is  found  in  5%  of  unresectable  or  metastatic  GISTs  (Liang  et  al.,  2016).  Avapritinib 
potently  inhibited  signalling  of  the  oncogenic  PDGFRα  D842V  mutant  protein  when  expressed  in  an 
engineered  cell  line  as  measured  by  inhibition  of  autophosphorylation  (IC50=  30  nM)  (Figure  2).  In 
contrast,  the  approved  GIST  therapy  imatinib  was  unable  to  inhibit  the  mutant  kinase  in  the  cellular 
setting,  even  at  concentrations  of  1  μM,  consistent  with  imatinib’s  reported  inactivity  in  this  patient 
population.

Inhibition of KIT Mutant Activity In Vivo 
Antitumor efficacy with avapritinib was demonstrated in a P815 mouse mastocytoma cell line xenograft 
model in which tumour growth was driven by a KIT exon 17 mutation (D816Y). Avapritinib administered 
orally at doses including 0.3, 1, 3, 10 or 30 mg/kg/day resulted in robust and dose-dependent growth 
inhibition of P815 xenograft tumours when assayed after 10 days. At doses of 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg 
QD, avapritinib caused complete tumour growth inhibition and regression (Table 3, Figure 3). Avapritinib 
10  mg/kg  treatment  lasted  for  17  days.  Tumour  growth  was  inhibited  from  day  0  to  day  9,  and  the 
tumours began to grow rapidly from day 10 to day  16. Avapritinib 30 mg/kg  treatment lasted for 31 
days. Tumours almost disappeared as early as day 4, but began to reappear at day 18 and grew to the 
end of the study (Figure 3).

Data points represent group mean of 10 mice per cohort, error bars represent standard error of the mean (SEM). 
Two mice in vehicle and avapritinib 0.3 mg/kg groups, one mouse in avapritinib 1 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg 
groups  died  on  day  9  and  one  mouse  in  avapritinib  3  mg/kg  group  died  on  day  8.  All  other  animals 
tolerated the treatment well with no impact on animal body weight (Figure 4). In contrast, the maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) of the nonselective kinase inhibitor dasatinib (25 mg/kg twice daily [BID]) resulted 
in  only  marginal  tumor  growth  inhibition  and  rapid  body  weight  loss  throughout  the  course  of  the 
experiment (Figure 4).

Direct inhibition of mutant KIT activity in P815 xenograft tumours was assessed after oral administration 
of 0.3, 1 and 3 mg/kg of avapritinib to tumour bearing mice. Avapritinib did not show significant inhibition 
on both p-c-kit and p-Akt at 4 hours and 24 hours post administration as compared with vehicle controls 
at these doses. The PD results were consistent with the in vivo efficacy in-life part (Figure 5).

In the same mouse model, the therapeutic efficacy of avapritinib at 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg was evaluated 
after nine days of treatment. The mean tumour sizes of avapritinib 10 mg/kg, 30 mg/kg, and 100 mg/kg 
QD groups were 28 mm3, 0 mm3 and 0 mm3 on Day 8, respectively. The tumors in avapritinib 30 mg/kg 
and 100 mg/kg QD groups almost disappeared both on Day 4, while these tumours began to reappear 
on Day 11 and Day 14, respectively, after the Day 9 treatment termination (Figure 6). All the mice in 
avapritinib  10  mg/kg,  30  mg/kg  and  100  mg/kg  QD  groups  died  on  Day  16,  Day  22,  and  Day  27, 
respectively. The median survival times of avapritinib 10 mg/kg, 30 mg/kg, and 100 mg/kg QD groups 
were  14  days,  19  days,  and  22  days,  respectively.  Avapritinib-treated  groups  statistically  prolonged 
survival  time  in  comparison  with  the  vehicle  group  (p  <  0.001).  Avapritinib  10  mg/kg  and  30  mg/kg 
were well tolerated during the dosing period, while avapritinib 100 mg/kg caused 7.2% body weight loss 
on Day 6 after the start of treatment (Figure 7).

inhibition of KIT mutant signaling in the tumour tissue was assessed by immunoblot. Quantitation of the 
phospho-KIT  signal  on  the  immunoblot  determined  the  percent  KIT  mutant  inhibition  in  avapritinib-
treated  animals  as  compared  with  vehicle-treated  control  animals.  A  dose-  and  time-dependent 
correlation  was  observed  between  the  concentration  of  avapritinib  in  mouse  plasma  and  the  level  of 
phosphorylated  KIT.  When  dosed  with  3  mg/kg  avapritinib  orally,  in  vivo  KIT  mutant  activity  was 
inhibited by at least 44% over the 24-hour dosing period. At 10 and 30 mg/kg avapritinib, doses that 
produced 100% tumour growth inhibition in efficacy studies, sustained inhibition of KIT activity reached 
75%  and  90%,  respectively  (Figure  8).  Dose-dependent  inhibition  of  the  downstream  biomarker 
phospho-AKT was also detected in P815 tumour homogenates after treatment with avapritinib (Figure 
8).

A  compilation  of  97  pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic  (PK/PD)  data  points  collected  after  oral 
administration  of  avapritinib  in  multiple  P815  xenograft  experiments  is  shown  in  Figure  9  and 
demonstrates a robust decrease in KIT mutant activity with increasing plasma drug levels. As efficacy 
was  associated  with  doses  producing  at  least  75%  KIT  mutant  inhibition,  the  plasma  concentration 
required  for  75%  inhibition  in  all  experiments  was  calculated  using  4-parameter  nonlinear  regression 
curve fitting and was determined to be 448 ng/mL. Similarly, the plasma concentration of avapritinib 
required for 90% KIT mutant inhibition was determined to be 923 ng/mL (Figure 9).

Compilation  of  avapritinib  pharmacokinetic  and  pharmacodynamic  measurements  in  P815-tumor  bearing  mice. 
P815  tumors  were  collected  after  oral  administration  of  avapritinib.  Tumor  homogenates  were  assayed  for  KIT 
inhibition with specific phospho-KIT antibodies by immunoblot analysis. The plasma concentration of each sample 
was  determined  by  liquid  chromatography/tandem  mass  spectrometry.  Percent  KIT  inhibition  and  plasma 
concentrations  from  97  tumor/plasma  pairs  from  multiple  individual  experiments  were  plotted.  The  plasma 
concentrations  required  for  75%  or  90%  KIT  mutant  inhibition  were  calculated  using  4-parameter  nonlinear 
regression curve fitting.  
Antitumor  efficacy  was  demonstrated in  an  imatinib-resistant  GIST  PDX  model  that  was  driven  by  an 
activated KIT exon 11/exon 17 double mutant (delW557K558/Y823D). In this model, the KIT exon 17 
mutant was an alternate amino acid substitution at residue 823 (Y823D) that is also observed in imatinib-
relapsed/refractory  KIT-driven  GIST.  Two  experiments  were  performed  in  this  model.  In  the  first, 
avapritinib administered orally for 27 days at either 30 or 100 mg/kg QD, resulted significant tumour 
growth  suppression  compared  to  vehicle  treatment.  Tumour  growth  inhibition  was  not  significantly 
different between 30 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg doses. Tumour suppression that was observed in all mice 
treated with 100 mg/kg dose of avapritinib was maintained for at least 4 weeks after the completion of 
avapritinib  dosing.  Tumour  regrowth  was  observed  in  6  of  8  mice  treated  with  30  mg/kg  dose  of 
avapritinib,  at  the  end  of  the  study  (study  day  57)  (Figure  10).  Direct  inhibition  of  KIT  activity  and 
downstream signalling (Erk and Akt phosphorylation) in the PDX tumour was measured by immunoblot 
in  tumour  lysates  collected  after  7  days  of  avapritinib  oral  dosing,  24  hours  after  the  last  dose. 
Immunoblot analysis of tumour homogenate revealed that avapritinib maintained >75% inhibition of KIT 
mutant activity with the 100 mg/kg dose and > 40% inhibition at the 30 mg/kg dose, 24 hours after the 
last dose. Similarly, downstream signalling components p-ERK and p-AKT were also inhibited in a dose-
dependent manner (Figure 10).

Mice bearing KIT exon 11/exon 17 mutant GIST PDXs were dosed once daily, orally with vehicle, 30 mg/kg, or 100 
mg/kg avapritinib for 27 days.  
Left  panel:  Tumor  growth  was  measured  twice  weekly  for  the  27-day  dosing  period  followed  by  a  28-day 
observation  period.  Avapritinib  induced  tumor  regression  and  sustained  tumor  growth  inhibition  at  both  doses 
tested.  Avapritinib  antitumor  activity  was  highly  statistically  significant  (P  <  0.0001  by  one-way  analysis  of 
variance). Data points represent group mean and error bars represent standard error of the mean for 9 mice per 
cohort.  
Right  panel:  After  7  days  of  once-daily  dosing  with  vehicle,  30  mg/kg  avapritinib,  or  100  mg/kg  avapritinib, 
tumors were harvested from 3 mice per group, 24 hours after the last dose. Tumor homogenates demonstrated 
inhibition of KIT signaling by analysis of KIT autophosphorylation and downstream signaling markers p-ERK and p-
AKT. 
A second experiment performed in the KIT exon 11/exon 17 mutant (delW557K558/Y823D) imatinib-
resistant GIST PDX model demonstrated antitumor activity with avapritinib at doses similar to that seen 
in the KIT D816Y driven P815 allograft tumors. Avapritinib administered orally for 27 days with 3, 10 or 
30 mg/kg QD, resulted in significant dose dependent antitumor activity compared to vehicle treatment. 
Treatment with the low dose of avapritinib (3 mg/kg, QD) resulted in minimal tumor growth over the 
28-day  period  whereas  treatment  with  higher  doses  of  avapritinib  (10  mg/kg  and  30  mg/kg,  QD) 
produced  tumor  regression.  Avapritinib  was  well  tolerated  with  no  adverse  effect  on  body  weight 
observed at any dose level. As expected, imatinib was not active in this model; regorafenib produced 
only tumor stasis and > 5% body weight loss at its maximum tolerated dose in mice. 
Figure 11. Dose Dependent Efficacy in a KIT Exon 11/17 Mutant GIST PDX Model 
Mice bearing KIT exon 11/exon 17 mutant GIST PDXs were dosed once daily, orally with vehicle, 3, 10 or 30 mg/kg 
avapritinib, 50 mg/kg imatinib BID or 30 mg/kg QD regorafenib for 28 days. Tumor growth was measured twice 
weekly  for  the  28-day  dosing  period.  Avapritinib  induced  tumor  regression  at  either  10  mg/kg  or  30  mg/kg. 
Avapritinib antitumor activity at 10 and 30 mg/kg QD was highly statistically significant (P < 0.001 by one-way 
analysis of variance). Data points represent group mean and error bars represent standard error of the mean for 
8 mice per cohort. 
In a KIT exon 11/exon 13 mutant (delW557K558/V654A) imatinib-resistant GIST PDX model, avapritinib 
demonstrated antitumor activity with doses of 30 mg/kg QD. Treatment with a 10 mg/kg QD dose of 
avapritinib resulted in minimal tumour growth inhibition over the 28-day period whereas treatment with 
30 mg/kg QD of avapritinib produced tumour regression. At 30 mg/kg QD, avapritinib was well tolerated 
with no adverse effect on body weight. As expected, imatinib was not active in this model; 40 mg/kg QD 
sunitinib produced tumour regression (Figure 12).

Mice bearing KIT exon 11/exon 13 mutant GIST PDXs were dosed once daily, orally with vehicle, 10, 30, or 80* 
mg/kg avapritinib, 50 mg/kg imatinib BID or 40 mg/kg QD sunitinib for 28 days. Tumour growth was measured 
twice weekly for the 28-day dosing period. Avapritinib induced tumour regression at either the 30 mg/kg or 80* 
mg/kg  QD  dose.  Avapritinib  antitumor  activity  at  30  and  80*  mg/kg  QD  was  statistically  significant  (Tukey’s 
multiple comparisons test). Data points represent group mean and error bars represent standard error of the mean 
for 8 mice per cohort. 
Avapritinib also demonstrated in vivo anti-tumour activity against GIST xenografts with other KIT mutant 
genotypes  including  primary  exon  9  and  exon  11  mutant  models  (UZLX-GIST9KIT  11+17  [p.P577del; 
W557LfsX5;D820G], UZLX-GIST3KIT 11 [p.W557_V559delinsF] and UZLX-GIST2BKIT 9 [p.A502_Y503dup]). 
In all three xenograft models, avapritinib (10 mg/kg) resulted in tumour volume stabilization compared 
with the baseline value. This effect was comparable to the effects induced by the higher dose of imatinib 
in UZLX-GIST2BKIT 9 (100 mg/kg) or to regorafenib in UZLX-GIST9KIT 11+17 (Fig. 10). Remarkably, at the 
dose  of  30  mg/kg,  avapritinib  treatment  resulted  in  substantial  tumour  regression  as  compared  with 
baseline in two of the tested models, to 27% in UZLX-GIST9KIT 11+17 (P = 0.005) and to 26% in GIST3KIT 
11 (P = 0.008, both WMP), and tumour volume stabilization (90%) in UZLX-GIST2BKIT 9 (P = 0.08, WMP). 
Similarly,  in  UZLX-GIST3KIT  11,  higher  dose  of  avapritinib  (100  mg/kg),  led  to  a  significant  tumour 
regression to 26% of baseline value (P = 0.005, WMP), which was similar to the effect of imatinib in this 
model  (Fig.  13B).  In  addition,  in  UZLX-GIST2BKIT  9,  avapritinib  at  a  dose  of  60  mg/kg  led  to  tumour 
shrinkage, which was significantly better than imatinib (at both doses) and comparable with sunitinib 
(Fig. 13C). Taken together, avapritinib induced remarkable and dose-dependent effects on tumor volume 
in all three models. 
During the course of this study, the treatment with avapritinib was well tolerated, and mice had a stable 
body weight within ethically acceptable limits.

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The  pharmacologic  specificity  of  avapritinib  was  assessed  against  a  panel  of  pharmacological  targets 
including receptors, transporters, and enzymes. Compound binding was calculated as a percent inhibition 
of the binding of a radioactively labelled ligand specific for each target. Assays for the following targets 
showed  >50%  inhibition  by  avapritinib  at  a  10  μM  screening  concentration:  5-  hydroxytryptamine 
transporter,  adenosine  A2A  receptor,  gamma  aminobutyric  acid-gated  chloride  channel,  dopamine 
transporter,  histamine  H2  receptor,  kappa  opioid  receptor,  muscarinic  acetylcholine  M2  and  M3 
receptors, norepinephrine transporter, mu opioid receptor, and the type 2 sodium channel. In subsequent 
studies, avapritinib had biochemical IC50 values of 280, 2900, 5800, and 2200 nM against the type 2 
sodium channel, histamine H2 receptor, muscarinic acetylcholine M2 receptor, and the norepinephrine 
transporter, respectively.

Irwin test assessment following 15-day oral administration of avapritinib to Sprague-Dawley 
rats. 
Oral (gavage) administration of avapritinib to female Sprague-Dawley rats at a dose level of 30 mg/kg 
for 15 consecutive days resulted in increased corneal reflex and increased pinna reflex in 1 of 6 animals. 
These signs were first observed on Day 7 and had resolved by Day 10. A dose level of 45 mg/kg resulted 
in  increased  touch  response,  increased  corneal  reflex,  increased  pinna  reflex,  head  flicking, 
exophthalmos, increased startle response, aggressiveness, vocalization, increased pain response, and/or 
tremors in up to 2 of 6 animals. These signs were first observed on Day 11, peaked at Day 13 and were 
still present on Day 14, the last day of the study. These findings show an increase in sensitivity to stimuli 
and are potentially underlying indicators of preconvulsive activity. These signs, although observed in a 
minority of treated animals, were considered test article-related. No avapritinib–related effects on the 
gross  behavioral,  physiological,  or  neurological  state  of  the  animals  were  noted  at  a  dose  level  of  15 
mg/kg. Based on the results of this study, the no-observed-effect level was 15 mg/kg avapritinib. 
Cardiovascular  and  respiratory  assessment  following  oral  gavage  administration  of 
avapritinib to conscious, radiotelemetry instrumented Beagle dogs. 
Administration of avapritinib via oral gavage to male Beagle dogs at dose levels of 15, 30, or 45 mg/kg 
did not result in avapritinib–related effects on any cardiovascular parameter (heart rate, mean arterial 
blood  pressure,  and  systolic,  diastolic,  and  pulse  pressure),  body  temperature,  ECG  waveform 
morphology,  duration  of  PR,  QRS,  RR,  QT,  and  QTcV  intervals,  respiratory  parameters  (respiratory 
frequency, tidal volume, and minute volume), or the clinical condition of the animals. Based on these 
results,  the  no-observed-effect  level  (NOEL)  for  cardiovascular  and  respiratory  function  following  oral 
gavage administration of avapritinib to male radiotelemetry-instrumented Beagle dogs was 45 mg/kg. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have not been performed with avapritinib. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion profiles of avapritinib have been characterized 
in nonclinical species both in vitro and in vivo and in human in vitro studies. 
Avapritinib is expected to be well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract in humans, as suggested by 
the high oral bioavailability (77-81%) and high fraction absorbed (fa*fg) in nonclinical species. 
Furthermore, based on these findings from MDCK-MDR1 and Caco-2 assays, efflux transport in gut is 
not expected to limit the oral bioavailability of avapritinib in humans. In addition, the plasma PK of 
avapritinib was not altered by pretreatment with pentagastrin or famotidine in dogs.  
Plasma clearance (CLplasma) of avapritinib was low in mouse and rat (≤ 10% liver blood flow) and was 
moderate in dog and monkey (≤ 40% liver blood flow). The apparent volume of distribution at a steady 
state (Vdss) was moderate to high in every species. 
Avapritinib displayed dose-proportional pharmacokinetics over a range of doses in rats and dogs 
including and above the therapeutic range. Accumulation was evident in rats after repeated doses. 
Difference in plasma exposure of avapritinib after repeated oral administrations was observed between 
male and female rats where the exposure was higher in female rats. On the other hand, plasma 
exposures in dogs were similar among the sexes.

After single-dose administration of avapritinib across the dose range of 30 to 400 mg in patients with 
GIST, the mean t1/2 was longer than in animals, ranging from 32 to 57 hours (Study BLU-285-1101). 
A longer half-life is expected to result in a higher accumulation ratio after repeated dosing. Steady 
state is however established in patients within 15 consecutive days of daily treatment.  
Plasma protein binding is high (>99 %) across all species tested (mouse, rat, dog, monkey, and human). 
Overall, the fraction unbound in plasma from human and dog was similar, and 2-3 fold higher than in 
plasma from mouse and rat. Distribution of avapritinib to red blood cells is low (blood to plasma ratio < 
1). Avapritinib was found to be stable in human, rat and dog plasma. 
Avapritinib  was  widely  distributed  to  majority  of  tissues.  The  distribution  of  [14C]-avapritinib-related 
radioactivity in nonpigmented rats was the highest in the lung, adrenal gland, and liver, and was the 
lowest in uveal tract and adipose. In gastrointestinal tissues like stomach wall, small intestine and large 
intestine, tissue to plasma ratios of 3.5, 5.8 and 6.8, respectively, are reported. The concentration of 
[14C]-avapritinib-derived  radioactivity  in  the  uveal  tract  and  skin  of  pigmented  Long  Evans  rats  was 
eliminated  more  slowly  and  was  approximately  2  to  330-fold  higher  than  in  these  tissues  in 
nonpigmented  rats.  These  results  suggest  that  avapritinib  may  have  an  affinity  to  these  melanin-
containing  tissues.  In  rats,  unbound  avapritinib  brain-to-plasma  ratio  was  approximately  8,  which 
indicated a potential for high brain penetration of avapritinib. 
The metabolic pathways in vitro for avapritinib are comparable between rat, dog, and human. It included 
N-demethylation  (M484),  oxidation  of  the  primary  amine  to  a  tertiary  alcohol  (M499)  whereby  the 
primary  amine  was  oxidized  to  an  alcohol,  and  oxidized  N-demethylated  metabolite  (M485)  and 
hydroxylation/oxidation  (M514a/b).  CYP3A4  (84.9%)  and  CYP2C9  (15.1%)  are  the  main  enzyme 
involved in the metabolism of avapritinib in vitro. 
The major component in plasma of rat, dog and human was unchanged avapritinib. Data from the [14C] 
avapritinib human ADME study, indicates that metabolites M690 (34.8%; hydroxy glucuronide) and M499 
(14.1%) are major circulating radioactive components. M499 was observed in rat plasma (31% of total 
radioactivity), and at lower levels in dog.M690 was detected in trace amounts in rats and dog plasma.  
Concomitant treatment with drugs that are strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers may alter 
the  PK  of  avapritinib  by  either  increasing  or  decreasing  plasma  concentrations.  The  potential  for 
avapritinib to inhibit  or induce  activity of  human  CYP  enzymes  and to inhibit human  transporters has 
been assessed in the Clinical part. PK interactions mediated by M690 and M499 were studied. 
The  excretion  data  indicate  that  biliary  excretion  is  the  major  route  of  elimination;  however,  the 
reproducible detection of [14C]-avapritinib-derived radioactivity in the feces of BDC rats also indicates 
active intestinal epithelial excretion. There are no data on excretion routes in dog.  
Excretion studies in milk have not been conducted in animals. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Although  dedicated  single-dose  toxicity  studies  were  not  conducted,  clinical  observations  of  poor 
toleration were noted in the single-dose PK studies in rats and dogs. In a non–GLP-compliant PK study, 
4 groups of male Sprague Dawley rats (n= 3/group) were administered single oral gavage doses of 10, 
30, 100, or 300 mg/kg of avapritinib. No clinical signs were noted in rats at doses up to 100 mg/kg; at 
Assessment report

Page 34/144 
 
 
 
a dose of 300 mg/kg, clinical signs of twitching, unsteady gait, hypersensitivity to touch, and vocalization 
upon handling were noted at the 24-hour time point.  
In a non–GLP-compliant PK study, 2 groups of male Beagle dogs (n= 3/group) were administered single 
oral gavage doses of 25 or 50 mg/kg of avapritinib. Emesis was noted in 5 of 6 dogs 1-hour postdose 
and 2 of 3 dogs at 50 mg/kg had loose stools 4-hours postdose. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
The following table resume the findings in repeat dose toxicity studies.

Clinical signs: Clinical observations included central nervous system findings (tremors, clonic convulsions, 
vocalization, vocalization upon handling, and hyper-reactivity to touch), cardio-pulmonary findings (cool and 
pale extremities and cool body), hunched posture, thin body condition, dermal atonia, and coloured material 
on various body surfaces. These avapritinib-related effects were generally noted with greatest incidence 
and/or severity in high dose group males and females, and took less time to be expressed in comparison to 
the mid-dose groups, suggesting that the effects were the result of total drug exposure over time.  
Food consumption, body weight and weight gain: Lower body weight gains and and/or body weight losses in 
the mid and high dose groups were accompanied by lower food consumption and frequently preceded death.  
Haematology: Alterations in the low, mid and high-dose groups, included reduced RBC, WBC (lymphocyte, 
neutrophil, monocyte, and eosinophil counts), haematocrit and haemoglobin; increased reticulocytes; 
increased platelet counts and prothrombin time (PT). At the recovery necropsy, avapritinib-related lower 
RBC counts and higher MCV, MCH, and RDW values persisted in the low-dose groups with partial 
improvement compared with the primary necropsy. 
Clinical chemistry and urinalysis: Alterations in all avapritinib groups, included increased serum chemistry 
parameters (ALP, ALT, AST, total bilirubin, glucose (not the low dose group), cholesterol, bicarbonate (not 
the low dose group)) and decreased phosphorus; change in cation/anion clearance in urine (total and 
corrected total increases in sodium, potassium, and chloride clearance values). Most changes in serum

chemistry were completely reversed in recovery though a few parameters (specifically phosphorus) were 
reversing, but not complete. Urine perturbations were reversed in recovery. 
Organ weight changes: Avapritinib-related changes in organ weights noted at the primary necropsy included 
higher adrenal gland, ovaries/oviducts, and uterus weights, and lower spleen and thymus weights.  
Microscopic changes: Microscopic changes were found in the hematopoietic and lymphoid systems (bone 
marrow with decreased cellularity and haemorrhage, spleen with increased extramedullary haematopoiesis, 
thymic cortex with decreased cellularity and increased apoptosis, and lymph nodes with decreased 
cellularity); in the femur with medullary hyperostosis and fibrosis and growth plate perturbation; in the 
adrenal cortex with hypertrophy; in reproductive tissues with reduced sperm in epididymis and seminal 
vesicles and prostate atrophy, ovaries with haemorrhagic luteal cysts, vagina with evidence of altered 
cyclicity; and, stomach with atrophy (only in unscheduled deaths). At the recovery necropsy, minimal 
increased extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen (1 male rat), severe bilateral testicular degeneration 
(1 male rat), and severe reduced luminal sperm and mild luminal cellular debris in the epididymis (1 male 
rat) were noted in the low-dose group males, and minimal to moderate hemorrhagic and cystic 
degeneration of the corpora lutea in the ovaries were noted in the low-dose group females. In the main 
study recovery groups, all anatomic pathologic changes were reversed, reversing, or compensatory to the 
effects of treatment, with the potential exceptions of the female gonadal effects, likely requiring a longer 
recovery period for return to normal. 
Toxicokinetics: The severely toxic dose with lethality in 10% of the animals (STD10) was greater than 30 
mg/kg/day in males and 20 mg/kg/day in female rats, based on the supplemental study and absence of 
convulsions (or other neurologic signs) or lethality after dose adjustment (in the final 2 weeks) in the main 
study at the mid dose of 75/50/30 mg/kg/day in males and 50/40/20 mg/kg/day in female rats. The dose 
levels of 30 mg/kg/day in male rats and 20 mg/kg/day in female rats did not result in severe toxicity, thus 
representing the HNSTD level and exposure values. The female rat is confirmed as the more sensitive sex, 
based on the dose administered. After 28-days of dosing, the exposure values at the HNSTD in the main 
study mid-dose group with ending dose of 30/20 mg/kg/day (males/females) are 7760/7500 ng/mL for Cmax 
and 136,000/137,000 ng·h/mL for AUC0-24.

Mortality: Several toxicological effects were observed in the animals that were found dead or euthanized, 
including body weight losses, clinical observations (behavioural/central nervous system findings (tremors, 
prostration, hunched posture, vocalization upon handling, and hyper-reactivity to touch), cardio-pulmonary 
findings (cool body to touch), decreased defecation, red discharge on the eye, red material on various body 
surfaces (forelimbs, hindlimbs, nose, and/or mouth), and yellow material on the urogenital area), and

haematological changes (lower red blood cell counts (RBC), haemoglobin values, and haematocrit values, 
higher mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH) values, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) values, and platelet 
counts), lower total leukocyte counts (white blood cell) and/or lower absolute lymphocyte and monocyte 
counts. Serum chemistry alterations included higher total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and/or gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) 
values, lower chloride, and higher potassium and bicarbonate values. Macroscopic test article-related 
changes in the unscheduled death animals were confined to the ovaries and consisted of dark red 
discoloration, enlargement, and/or cysts. These changes correlated with microscopic changes of 
haemorrhagic and cystic degeneration in the ovaries. Microscopic changes included hypertrophy of the zona 
fasciculata in the adrenal gland; decreased hematopoietic cellularity in the femoral or sternal bone marrow; 
increased thickness of the zone of hypertrophy or the primary spongiosa of the physeal growth plate in the 
femur; hyperostosis in the femur; haemorrhagic and cystic degeneration of the ovaries, lymphoid depletion 
of the thymus, spleen, and/or lymph nodes; increased extramedullary haematopoiesis in the spleen; and 
increased mucification with or without neutrophilic infiltrates in the vaginal mucosa.  
Food consumption, body weight and weight gain: There were no test article-related effects on body weights 
or food consumption in the animals that survived to the scheduled necropsies.  
Coagulation: There were no test article-related effects on coagulation. 
Ophthalmology: There were no test article-related effects on ophthalmology. 
Clinical observations: Test article-related clinical observations for animals in the 45/30 mg/kg/day group 
that survived to the scheduled necropsies included red material around the nose in a single animal from 
study days 14-26. Test article-related clinical observations for animals in the 30 mg/kg/day group that 
survived to the scheduled necropsies included vocalization upon handling and hyper-reactivity to touch in a 
single animal on study day 28, and red material around the eye in a different animal from study days 24-28. 
Haematology: Test article-related alterations in haematology parameters included the following: red blood 
cell parameters (minimally to mildly lower RBC counts, haemoglobin values, haematocrit values, and 
lower/higher reticulocyte [45/30 mg/kg/day group only; lower on study day 14 and mildly higher on study 
day 28] and platelet counts [45/30 mg/kg/day group only on study day 14]; and minimal to mild higher 
MCV, MCH, and red blood cell distribution width [RDW], and/or haemoglobin distribution width [HDW] 
values) were noted in the 30 and 45/30 mg/kg/day groups on study day 14 and at the study day 28 
primary necropsy. At the study day 42 recovery necropsy, minimally lower RBC counts were noted in the 30 
and 45/30 mg/kg/day groups indicating partial recovery. In addition, higher reticulocyte counts and MCV, 
MCH, RDW, and HDW values were noted in the 30 and 45/30 mg/kg/day groups, indicating continued bone 
marrow response consistent with a rebound effect, consistent with a partial recovery. 
Serum chemistry: Test article-related alterations in serum chemistry parameters noted in the 30 and 45/30 
mg/kg/day groups on study day 14 and/ at the study day 28 primary necropsy included higher ALP (45/30 
mg/kg/day group only on study day 28), ALT, AST, GGT (study day 28 only), total bilirubin, cholesterol, and 
triglyceride values. At the study day 42 recovery necropsy, these alterations had reversed with the 
exception of higher cholesterol values in the 30 and 45/30 mg/kg/day groups, which had partially reversed. 
Urine chemistry parameters: Test article-related alterations in urine chemistry parameters on study day 28 
in the 30 and 45/30 mg/kg/day groups included higher mean total sodium, corrected total sodium, total 
potassium, corrected total potassium, total chloride, and corrected total chloride values. At the study day 42 
recovery necropsy, these alterations had reversed in the 30 mg/kg/day group, with the exception of higher 
sodium values. At the study day 42 necropsy, none of the alterations in urine chemistry parameters in the 
45/30 mg/kg/day group had reversed.

Macroscopic findings: Test article-related macroscopic findings noted at the primary necropsy included an 
enlarged adrenal gland in a single 30 mg/kg/day group animal, and dark red discoloration and enlarged 
ovaries in the 30 and 45/30 mg/kg/day groups. Findings of dark red discoloration and enlarged ovaries in 
the ovaries persisted, and cysts in the ovaries were noted in the 30 and 45/30 mg/kg/day groups at the 
recovery necropsy. 
Organ weights: Test article-related higher adrenal gland and ovaries/oviduct weights and lower spleen and 
thymus weights were noted in the 30 and 45/30 mg/kg/day groups at the primary necropsy at 
approximately the same magnitude. Lower ovaries/oviducts weights were noted in the 30 and 45/30 
mg/kg/day groups on study day 42, but were partially recovered. 
Microscopic changes: Test article-related microscopic changes were noted at a similar incidence and severity 
in the 30 and 45/30 mg/kg/day groups at the primary necropsy and included the following: mild 
haemorrhagic and cystic degeneration in the ovaries (marked in a single 45/30 mg/kg/day animal), minimal 
to mild increased mucification and neutrophilic infiltrates in the vagina; mild increased mucification of the 
cervix in the 45/30 mg/kg/day group only; minimal to moderate decreased hematopoietic cellularity of the 
femoral and sternal bone marrow, and minimal hyperostosis (45/30 mg/kg/day group only) of the femoral 
bone marrow; increased thickness of the hypertrophic zone cartilage and primary spongiosa of the femur 
and minimally increased thickness of the physeal growth plate of the femur; minimal to mild hypertrophy of 
the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex; minimal increased extramedullary haematopoiesis in the spleen 
in the 30 mg/kg/day group only; and minimal lymphoid depletion of the axillary lymph node and minimal to 
mild lymphoid depletion of the spleen and thymus (30 mg/kg/day group only). At the study day 42 recovery 
necropsy, mild to moderate haemorrhagic and cystic degeneration in the ovaries was noted in the 30 and 
45/30 mg/kg/day groups (partially reversed), and minimal hyperostosis in the femoral bone marrow was 
noted in a single 45/30 mg/kg/day group animal. 
Toxicokinetics: All rats dosed orally by gavage with avapritinib were systemically exposed to avapritinib. 
Exposure increased with increasing dosage on study day 0 in terms of AUC0-24 and Cmax. The increase in 
exposure to avapritinib was nearly proportional to the increase in dosage. The Tmax for avapritinib in plasma 
was generally observed at 3 or 6 hours post-dose for rats. Based on the unscheduled deaths in 2 female 
rats, including an additional animal with a single incidence of neurologic signs (vocalization and 
hypersensitivity to touch), the STD10 dose in female rats is 30 mg/kg/day. The terminal Day 27 steady 
state AUC0-24 and Cmax at the STD10 dose of 30 mg/kg/day are 208,000 ng·h/mL and 11,200 ng/mL, 
respectively.

General toxicological considerations: Test article-related findings generally increased in incidence and/or 
severity with increasing dosage with even the lowest dosage levels in males and females having multiple, 
albeit less severe, test article-related effects. At the 10 mg/kg/day dosage level in males and 5 mg/kg/day 
dosage level in females, test article-related findings still included minimal to mild haematology, coagulation, 
Assessment report

and urinalysis parameter alterations; presence of gross observations (limited to ovaries); and minimal to 
mild histologic changes in multiple tissues. 
Food consumption and body weight/weight gain: There were no test article-related effects on food 
consumption. Test article-related higher body weights were noted in all test article-treated male and female 
groups. 
Ophthalmology: There were no test article-related effects on ophthalmic findings. 
Clinical observations: Test article-related clinical observations included red material around the eyes (mid 
and high dose males) and red material around the nose (low, mid and high dose males). The incidence of 
these observations increased with increasing dosage level. 
Haematology: Red blood cell parameter alterations (lower RBC count, haemoglobin, and haematocrit 
values; reticulocyte value alterations; higher MCV, MCH, RDW, and HDW values); coagulation parameter 
alterations (higher platelet count and MPV); leukogram parameter alterations (lower monocyte and 
eosinophil counts); 
Serum chemistry: Serum chemistry parameter alterations (higher total protein, albumin, globulin, A/G ratio, 
ALT, AST, GGT, total bilirubin, and cholesterol); 
Urine chemistry parameters: Urinalysis parameter alterations (higher urine pH and increased leukocytes on 
macroscopic urinalysis) 
Macroscopic findings: Gross observations of enlarged adrenal glands, small thymus, and several ovarian 
changes (cysts, dark red areas, dark red discoloration, and enlarged) 
Organ weights: Organ weight differences including higher adrenal gland, heart, kidney, liver, and 
ovaries/oviducts weights 
Microscopic changes: Histologic changes involving the hematopoietic and lymphoid systems (decreased 
cellularity of hematopoietic cells and haemorrhage in the bone marrow [femur and sternum], increased 
bone formation and fibroplasia in the bone marrow [femur], increased extramedullary haematopoiesis and 
increased pigmented macrophages in the spleen, and decreased lymphoid cellularity in the thymic cortex), 
femur (increased thickness of the zone of hypertrophic cartilage), adrenal cortex (hypertrophy and cystic 
degeneration), and reproductive tissues (haemorrhagic and cystic degeneration of the ovarian corpora lutea, 
reproductive cycle alteration, and vaginal mucification). 
Toxicokinetics: The increase in exposure to avapritinib, in terms of AUC0-24 and Cmax, was nearly 
proportional to the increase in dosage from 10 to 30 mg/kg/day for males, except on study day 90, where 
the relationship was less than dose-proportional. For females, the increase in exposure to avapritinib was 
nearly proportional to the increase in dosage. Accumulation was evident at all dosage levels, with 
accumulation ratios that ranged from 1.6 to 2.4 for males and from 1.7 to 2.1 for females. Exposure (AUC0-
24) was higher in females than in males at all dosage levels on both evaluation days. The Tmax for avapritinib 
in plasma was generally observed at 3 or 6 hours post-dose for both genders at all dosage levels. The 
severely toxic dose in 10% of animals (STD10) was not defined. The highest nonseverely toxic dose 
(HNSTD) was considered to be ≥30 mg/kg/day for the males and ≥25 mg/kg/day for the females, the 
highest dose administered in this study. This dosage corresponded to mean AUC0-24 values of 68,100 and 
117,000 ng*h/mL and mean Cmax values of 3870 and 6740 ng/mL for males and females, respectively, on 
study day 90.

Mortality: Prior to euthanasia, pertinent clinical observations noted in these animals included emesis, 
injected sclera, thin body condition, dermal atonia, changes in faecal consistency (diarrhoea), wet clear 
material on various body surfaces (mouth, ventral neck, and/or forelimbs), salivation, and/or reddened 
ears. Test article-related changes in haematology parameters for these early death animals included lower 
red blood cell (RBC) counts, haemoglobin, haematocrit, absolute reticulocytes (females only), red cell 
distribution width, haemoglobin distribution width, and mean corpuscular volume (females only) and higher 
mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration. In addition, both animals showed lower absolute lymphocytes 
and eosinophils. Changes in serum chemistry parameters included lower values for albumin, globulin, total 
protein, alkaline phosphatase, phosphorus, and calcium and higher values for total bilirubin, aspartate 
aminotransferase, gamma glutamyltransferase, and creatine kinase in both animals, and higher sorbitol 
dehydrogenase and chloride in the female. Small thymus was noted in the male which correlated with test 
article-related thymic atrophy, decreased lymphoid cellularity, and increased lymphoid apoptosis. A 
microscopic finding specific to animals euthanized in extremis was minimal to mild oesophageal erosion at 
the junction of the oesophagus and stomach. Other avapritinib-related changes in the 2 early death animals 
consisted of increased severity of hypospermatogenesis of the testis, decreased cellularity and haemorrhage 
in the bone marrow, and a plethora of changes in lymphoid organs (decreased lymphoid cellularity, 
increased lymphoid apoptosis, decreased germinal centers, decreased size of lymphoid follicles, and/or 
atrophy). The cause of moribundity necessitating euthanasia was considered to be due to inanition.  
Ophthalmology: There were no test article-related ophthalmic findings. 
ECG: There were no test article-related effects on electrocardiographic parameters. 
Clinical observations: In the mid- and high-dose groups (M and F), avapritinib-related clinical observations 
included emesis (containing white material, yellow material, and/or food), clear material on various body 
surfaces (mouth, ventral neck, and/or forelimbs), and/or salivation generally from study day 0 through 12. 
These clinical observations were generally not noted after lowering the dosage level to 15 mg/kg/day and 
were not noted during the recovery period. 
Food consumption, body weight gain and body weight: Avapritinib-related mean body weight losses and 
corresponding lower mean food consumption were generally noted in both high-dose groups through study 
day 10. Lower food consumption was also noted for a single female in the mid dose group. To limit the

impact of body weight loss and low food consumption, the daily feed ration for all animals was 
supplemented with moist food. 
Haematology: On study day 28 lower red blood cells (RBC), haemoglobin, and haematocrit values and 
higher haemoglobin distribution width (HDW) were seen at all dosage levels. In the low dose group, higher 
absolute reticulocytes and red cell distribution width (RDW) were observed. In the mid and high-dose 
groups, lower reticulocyte values and higher corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC) were seen. A 
lower total white blood cells counts (WBC), neutrophil, eosinophil, and basophil values, and higher platelet 
counts were observed at all dosage levels. After the 14-day recovery period, reduced eosinophil and 
monocyte (males only) values and higher platelet values in males and females were still observed. Higher 
RBC, haemoglobin, haematocrit, absolute reticulocytes, RDW, HDW, MCV (females only), WBC, absolute 
neutrophils, and absolute eosinophil (females only) values were also observed as rebound effects. 
Clinical chemistry: Avapritinib-related changes in serum chemistry parameters on study day 28 were noted 
as lower calcium, phosphorus, total protein, albumin, globulin, creatinine, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 
cholesterol, and triglyceride values and higher chloride, total bilirubin, and urea nitrogen values at all 
dosage levels; and higher aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and creatine kinase (CK), sorbitol 
dehydrogenase (SDH), and glucose values in the mid and high-dose groups. All changes were slight. After 
the 14-day recovery period, lower albumin, cholesterol, triglyceride, and ALP values and a higher urea 
nitrogen value were still observed in the mid-dose group.  
Urinalysis: A possible avapritinib-related change on study day 28 was observed as lower urine osmolality in 
the mid and high-dose group males and females. The urine osmolality value in the mid-dose group males 
remained lower on study day 42. 
Necropsy and organ weight changes: Avapritinib-related small spleen and small thymus were each observed 
in a high-dose group male. There were no macroscopic observations noted at the study day 42 recovery 
necropsy. Avapritinib-related organ weight changes included the following: higher heart weights in the mid-
dose group females and the high-dose group males and females; lower spleen weights in all avapritinib-
treated male and females groups; lower thymus weights in all test article-treated male groups and the mid 
and high-dose group females; and lower testes weights in all test article-treated male groups. At the study 
day 42 recovery necropsy, avapritinib-related organ weight changes consisted of lower thymus weights in 
males and females and lower spleen weights in males, and higher heart weights in males and higher spleen 
weights in females in the mid dose-group. 
Microscopic findings: Avapritinib-related microscopic findings consisted of the following: mild haemorrhage

minimal to severe hypospermatogenesis in the testis, minimal increased lymphoid apoptosis, minimal or 
mild decreased lymphoid cellularity, and minimal extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen, mild to 
severe decreased cellularity of hematopoietic cells and minimal or mild haemorrhage in the femoral and/or 
sternal bone marrow, minimal or mild increased lymphoid apoptosis, mild decreased lymphoid cellularity, 
and minimal to moderate decreased germinal centers in the axillary lymph nodes, minimal or mild increased 
lymphoid apoptosis, minimal or mild decreased size of lymphoid follicles, and minimal or mild neutrophil 
infiltrate in the Peyer’s patches, minimal increased apoptosis and minimal or mild decreased lymphoid 
cellularity in the gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) in the stomach, and/or minimal to severe atrophy, 
minimal increased lymphoid apoptosis, and minimal decreased lymphoid cellularity in the thymus at all 
dosage levels. At the study day 42 recovery necropsy, avapritinib-related microscopic findings consisted of 
the following: mild haemorrhage of the brain, mild to severe hypospermatogenesis in the testis, immature 
epididymis, minimal increased cellularity of hematopoietic cells in the femoral bone marrow, minimal and/or 
mild extramedullary haematopoiesis in the spleen and axillary lymph node, minimal or mild decreased size 
of the lymphoid follicles in the Peyer’s patches, and minimal to moderate atrophy and minimal increased

lymphoid apoptosis in the thymus in the mid-dose group. In 1 dog, a mature thrombus was in the plane of 
section, suggesting infarction as the cause of the haemorrhage.  
Toxicokinetics: Exposure (AUC0-24 and Cmax), increased with increasing dosage on study day 0 and study day 
27 for male and female dogs. The increase in exposure was less than proportional to the increase in dosage 
from 15 to 60 mg/kg/day on study day 0, and nearly dose proportional to the increase in dosage from 7.5 
to 15 mg/kg/day on study day 27. Exposure (AUC0-24) was similar between genders. The Tmax was generally 
observed at 1 or 2 hours post-dose for male and female dogs. Plasma avapritinib concentrations increased 
through 1 or 2 hours post-dose and remained relatively level or decreased slowly through 24 hours post-
dose. The terminal elimination phase was inadequate to determine half-life for all groups. Based on the 
results of this study and given the indication of the test article, the highest non-severely-toxic dosage 
(HNSTD) level was considered to be 7.5 mg/kg/day. At this dosage level, mean Cmax values were 462 and 
475 ng/mL and mean AUC0-24 values were 5820 and 6410 ng·hr/mL for males and females, respectively, on 
study day 27.

Mortality: Prior to death or euthanasia, these animals were noted with avapritinib-related clinical 
observations of laboured respiration, clear ocular discharge, emesis (containing food, white material, or 
yellow material), salivation, tremors, hypoactivity, partial closure of the eyes, prominent nictitating 
membranes, ataxia, vocalization, vocalization upon handling, hunched posture, injected sclerae, cool 
extremities, white frothy material around the mouth, and/or pale nose, gums, body, and/or extremities. In 
addition, these animals were noted with macroscopic findings in the adrenal glands, brain, gastrointestinal 
tract, gingiva, joint, liver, pituitary gland, skin, spleen, thymus, and/or trachea and microscopic findings in 
the brain, spinal cord, bone marrow, spleen, thymus, lymph nodes, Peyer’s patches, adrenal cortex, adrenal 
medulla, gastrointestinal tract, and/or testes. Brain haemorrhage was considered the cause of death or 
moribundity for all animals in the high-dose groups. A single mid-dose group male was found dead on study 
day 80; however, the cause of death for this male was oral gavage error and was not test article-related.  
Clinical observations: Avapritinib-related clinical observations were noted for the low and mid-dose group 
males and females and included clear ocular discharge, emesis (containing white material), and pale nose, 
gums, and extremities. In addition, test article-related pale body was noted for two mid-dose group males. 
Food consumption and body weight: Test article-related lower body weights and corresponding lower food 
consumption values were noted for the high-dose group females beginning during the second week of 
dosing. Mean body weights in this group were 6.3% to 10.0% lower than the control group during study 
weeks 4-6. 
Ophthalmology: There were no avapritinib-related ophthalmic findings.  
ECG: There were no avapritinib-related alterations in electrocardiography parameters. 
Urinalysis: There were no test article-related alterations in urinalysis parameters.

Haematology and clinical chemistry: Avapritinib-related clinical pathology alterations were noted in all 
groups, and included lower red blood cells, haemoglobin, haematocrit, white blood cells, neutrophils, 
lymphocytes, total protein, albumin, cholesterol, and calcium and higher platelets, prothrombin time and 
aspartate aminotransferase for males and/or females. Higher red cell distribution width, haemoglobin 
distribution width, activated partial thromboplastin time, and sorbitol dehydrogenase values were also noted 
for the high-dose group males and/or females. In addition, higher mean corpuscular volume was higher and 
reticulocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils were lower for the low and mid-dose group males and/or 
females; phosphorus and globulin were lower for the low-dose group males and females and the high-dose 
group males; potassium was higher for the mid-dose group males and females and the high-dose group 
males and lower for the high-dose group females; and alkaline phosphatase was lower for the mid-dose 
group males and females. The high-dose group males and females were also noted with higher or lower 
reticulocyte values in several animals. 
Necropsy and organ weight changes: Avapritinib-related macroscopic findings were noted for the low and 
mid-dose group males and females at the scheduled necropsy and included small thymus, oedematous 
thymus, and pale gingiva, skin, thymus, and/or thyroid. Avapritinib-related organ weight alterations 
included lower spleen weights for the low and mid-dose group males and females and lower thymus weights 
for the mid-dose group males and females. 
Microscopic findings: Avapritinib-related microscopic findings in the following tissues were noted for the low 
and mid-dose groups at the scheduled necropsy: bone marrow (decreased cellularity of hematopoietic cells 
and/or haemorrhage), spleen (increased extramedullar hematopoiesis and/or increased pigmented 
macrophages), Peyer’s patches (decreased lymphoid cellularity and/or increased lymphoid apoptosis), 
thymus (decreased lymphoid cellularity and/or increased lymphoid apoptosis), lymph nodes (increased 
pigmented macrophages, increased lymphoid apoptosis, decreased lymphoid cellularity, sinus 
erythrocytosis, and/or brown pigment), gastrointestinal tract (mucosal oedema, neutrophil infiltrate, and/or 
glandular dilation), testes (hypospermatogenesis), and brain (choroid plexus oedema). Males and/or 
females in the mid-dose group were also noted with additional findings in the brain (haemorrhage), adrenal 
cortex (angiectasis, haemorrhage, and brown pigment), pituitary gland (angiectasis), and gastrointestinal 
tract (mucosal atrophy). 
Toxicokinetics: The increase in exposure to avapritinib was nearly proportional to the increase in dosage 
from 7.5 to 30 mg/kg/day in terms of AUClast and Cmax on study days 0 and 41. On study day 90, the 
increase in AUClast and Cmax was approximately 2-fold in males and <1.5-fold in females over the 2-fold 
increase in dosage from 7.5 to 15 mg/kg/day. Exposure (AUClast) was similar between genders, differences 
were <2-fold. The Tmax for avapritinib in plasma was observed at 1, 2, or 4 hours following dose 
administration for individual male and female dogs. The terminal elimination phase was inadequate to 
determine half-life for both genders and all groups on all evaluation days. The highest non-severely toxic 
dose (HNSTD) was considered to be 7.5 mg/kg/day for males and females. The dosage level of 7.5 
mg/kg/day corresponded to mean AUClast values of 6090 ng·hr/mL and 6330 ng·hr/mL and Cmax values of 
456 ng/mL and 485 ng/mL for males and females, respectively, on study day 90.

Avapritinib was not mutagenic in the bacterial reverse mutation assay. The Ames test was negative up 
to maximal tested concentration, but limited by cytotoxicity. It was positive in the in vitro chromosomal 
aberration assay, however, no evidence of clastogenicity was noted in vivo in the repeated dose rat bone 
marrow  micronucleus  assay.  Therefore,  taking  into  consideration  all  the  three  genotoxicity  studies, 
avapritinib is not mutagenic and nonclastogenic in vivo, and thus, overall non-genotoxic. 
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies have been conducted with avapritinib.  
Reproduction Toxicity 
No studies to investigate fertility and early embryonal development have been conducted. 
The objectives of the GLP-compliant embryo-foetal developmental toxicity study were to determine the 
potential of avapritinib to induce developmental toxicity after maternal exposure during the critical period 
of organogenesis and to characterize maternal toxicity at the exposure levels tested. In addition, a TK 
assessment  of  avapritinib  was  performed  on  Gestation  Days  6  and  17  in  a  satellite  group  of  8 
animals/dose.  
Avapritinib  was  administered  orally  by  gavage  to  4  groups  (n=10/group)  of  time-mated  female 
Crl:CD(SD) rats once daily from Gestation Days 6-17. Dose levels were 0 (vehicle control), 5, 10, 20, 
and 30 mg/kg/day. The female rats were approximately 12–13 weeks of age at the initiation of dose 
administration.  
All rats survived to the scheduled necropsy. There were no avapritinib-related clinical observations noted 
at the daily examinations at any dose level. Mean body weight losses and/or lower mean body weight 
gains,  and  corresponding  lower  mean  food  consumption  were  variably  noted  in  the  10,  20  and  30

mg/kg/day groups during the dosing phase, but comparable to control and 5 mg/kg/day groups. The 
lower mean body weight gains late in gestation in the 10, 20, and 30 mg/kg/day groups were attributed 
to  avapritinib-related  higher  mean  post-implantation  loss  and/or  lower  mean  fetal  body  weights. 
Furthermore, the 10, 20, and 30 mg/kg/day doses resulted in lower mean gravid uterine weights than 
the control group in a dose-related manner as a result of the post-implantation loss and/or lower mean 
fetal body weights. The 5 mg/kg/day group was unaffected. Dark red discoloration and/or enlargement 
(30 mg/kg/day group only) were noted in the ovaries of 2, 2, and 4 nongravid rats in the 10, 20, and 
30 mg/kg/day groups, respectively, and in one rat in the 20 mg/kg/day group that was determined to 
be  gravid  (single  implantation  that  resulted  in  an  early  resorption).  Dark  red  discoloration  and  the 
enlarged ovary corresponded to ovarian hemorrhages based on microscopic examinations. Avapritinib-
related  minimal  to  marked  hemorrhages  were  observed  microscopically  in  the  ovaries  and  were 
characterized  by  enlarged  corpora  lutea  with  central,  dilated  blood-filled  cavities,  dilated  vasculature 
throughout  the  ovarian  tissue,  and  rarely  extravasated  red  blood  cells  that  were  present  free  in  the 
ovarian tissue. A clear dose response was apparent. 
As  a  result  of  the  reduced  fetal  viability  noted  in  the  current  study  at  doses  >10  mg/kg/day,  10 
mg/kg/day  dose  was  determined  to  be the  highest feasible dose  from  a  fetal assessment  standpoint. 
Intrauterine growth and survival and fetal morphology at 5 mg/kg/day were unaffected by test article 
administration.  
Following oral administration of avapritinib to pregnant rats, all animals were exposed to avapritinib in 
a dose-dependent manner. Exposure was nearly dose proportional in terms of AUClast and Cmax over the 
6-fold  increase  in  dose  from  5  to  30  mg/kg/day  on  Gestation  Days  6  and  17.  There  was  no  notable 
accumulation  of  avapritinib  in  terms  of  AUClast  following  repeated  administration  for  12  days.  The  TK 
parameters are summarized in Table 15. 
Table 15. Summary of Toxicokinetic Parameters 
Based on adverse ovarian hemorrhages that likely resulted in an increase in non-gravid rats in the 10, 
20, and 30 mg/kg/day groups, a dose level of 5 mg/kg/day was the NOAEL for maternal toxicity. Based 
on adverse avapritinib related effects on fetal weights, viability (higher mean litter proportions of post-
implantation  loss  and  lower  mean  litter  proportions  and/or  mean  numbers  of  viable  fetuses),  and/or 
increases in visceral and skeletal malformations in the 10, 20, and 30 mg/kg/day groups, 5 mg/kg/day 
was the NOAEL for embryo/fetal development. On Gestation Day 17, the AUClast and Cmax at the NOAEL 
of 5 mg/kg/day were 19,300 ng.h/mL and 1190 ng/mL, respectively.

Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance was assessed by reviewing the digestive track changes in the GLP-compliant 28-day and 
3-month toxicology studies in rats and dogs. No evidence of local gastrointestinal effects occurred in the 
rat at minimally lethal doses or lower. In the Beagle dog, at lethal exposures diarrhea (without histologic 
correlate) and esophageal and stomach erosions occurred. Emesis was noted in dogs at the HNSTD and 
the severely toxic dose levels. 
Other toxicity studies 
Ten specific impurities were identified in avapritinib drug substance. 
In silico safety and in vitro genotoxicity assessments were conducted per ICH M7 (R1). The standard in 
silico  structure  activity  relationship  software  programs  DEREK  and  SARAH  concluded  three  of  the  10 
impurities (C458/BLU133737, C613/BLU136700 and D147/ BLU136707) were negative, one was positive 
(C377/ BLU133735) and the genotoxic potential of 6 impurities (C402/ BLU110570, C614/ BLU110498, 
C827/ BLU112883, C358/ BLU133730, C359/ BLU133732, and C360/ BLU133733) could not be predicted 
by QSARs because they were negative for DEREK and equivocal for SARAH, or out of domain for both. 
Three of the 10 impurities (C377, C402, and C614) were tested in the GLP-compliant bacterial reverse 
mutation assays and were demonstrated to be nonmutagenic. 
Despite impurity BLU112316 level (0.55%) is above the qualification thresholds defined in ICH Q3A 
(0.15%), it is qualified up to 0.78% based on the 3-month rat toxicity study. BLU-112316 can be 
considered non genotoxic based on in vitro (Ames and micronucleus test) and in vivo (rat bone marrow 
and the liver comet assays) studies.

An environmental risk assessment report of avapritinib has been submitted. 
The  assessment  of  environmental  risk  of  avapritinib  was  based  in  prevalence  data.  The  predicted 
environmental  concentration  (PEC)  for  avapritinib  is  0.0041  μg/L,  which  is  below  the  trigger  value  of 
0.01 μg/L as given by EMEA (2018). The assessment therefore does not proceed to Phase II – Tier A.

The logDow for avapritinib was determined experimentally using a shake flask method (OECD 107). The 
logDow value was determined to be 3.6.  
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The  primary  non-clinical  pharmacodynamic  data  submitted  as  part  of  this  application  support  a 
therapeutic rationale in the proposed indications.  
Avapritinib showed broad inhibitory activity against a panel of GIST relevant KIT and PDGFRα mutant 
enzymes  including  the  KIT  exon  11,  17  and  18  mutants,  and  all  PDGFRα  exon  18  mutants  tested. 
Avapritinib demonstrated lower binding affinity for the small group of highly related class III receptor 
tyrosine  kinases  to  which  KIT  belongs  as  KIT  wild  type  (Kd=  17  nM),  PDGFRα  wild  type  (Kd=  1  nM), 
PDGFRβ  (Kd=  1  nM),  CSF1R  (Kd=  6  nM)  and  FLT3  (Kd=  31  nM),  but  all  other  456  human  kinases 
demonstrated  Kd  greater  than  50  nM,  demonstrating  that  avapritinib has  limited  potential  for  kinome 
activity outside of the related class III receptor tyrosine kinases. 
In in vivo studies avapritinib produced significant antitumor activity, including partial regression at higher 
doses,  in  several  KIT  mutant  driven  tumours  models,  with  inhibition  of  KIT  mutant  activity  and 
downstream signaling markers (Erk and Akt phosphorylation).  
Tumour regrowth was observed in the P815 xenograft model before treatment termination. Levels of KIT 
phosphorylation and genetic analysis of samples from these animals suggest that a secondary KIT exon 
14 mutation (human equivalent of T670I) or KIT-independent alternate resistance mechanisms may be 
responsible for the increased tumour proliferation.  
The Applicant was requested to analyse the levels of KIT phosphorylation in samples from P815 xenograft 
in  which  tumour  regrowth  was  observed.  The  analysis  showed  avapritinib  treatment  inhibited  KIT 
phosphorylation at more than 70%, which can be associated to antitumor efficacy, based on the PK/PD 
model. Additionally the genetic analysis of the samples showed the tumour with the lowest degree of 
KIT  phosphorylation  inhibition  showed  a  heterozygous  T669I  mutation,  equivalent  to  the  human  KIT 
T670I mutation in exon 14, for which avapritinib has shown a potency shift in a biochemical panel of KIT 
mutants and may represent an avapritinib resistance mutation. The rest of tumours (16/17) developed 
uncharacterized  KIT  mutations  or  no  additional  KIT  mutations  were  detectable,  suggesting  that  KIT-
independent alternate resistance mechanisms may be responsible for the increased tumour proliferation 
in those samples. Data for patients with KIT D816Y mutation are limited to two patients with different 
progression of the disease after treatment with avapritinib. Therefore, no conclusion on the resistance 
to avapritinib can be reached based on clinical data. 
Although  inhibition  of  PDGFRα  exon  18  mutants  by  avapritinib  at  low  nM  concentrations  has  been 
demonstrated, the effect of avapritinib in PDGFRα driven in vivo animal tumour models have not been 
examined. According to the ICH S9 Q&A document, the lack of in vivo characterization can be accepted 
if in vitro systems used for pharmacology studies of anti-tumour activity are demonstrated to generate 
relevant  data.  This  is  considered  fulfilled  in  the  non-clinical  dossier  for  avapritinib.  Furthermore,  the 
clinical efficacy data for patients with identified PDGFRα D842V mutation are considered to provide proof 
of concept. 
Adverse effects on cardiovascular or respiratory parameters have not been observed in non-clinical in 
vitro  or  in  vivo  studies.  There  were  however  findings  in  rat  studies  indicating  an  avapritinib  induced 
increase in sensitivity to stimuli that are considered as potentially underlying indictors of preconvulsive 
activity. 
Avapritinib demonstrated high oral bioavailability across preclinical species (77-81%). Avapritinib was 
not a human P-gp substrate and efflux transporters in gut are not expected to limit the oral bioavailability

of avapritinib. In addition, the plasma PK of avapritinib was not altered by pretreatment with pentagastrin 
or famotidine in dogs, suggesting that the use of gastric pH altering medications such as proton-pump 
inhibitor is not expected to change the absorption of avapritinib.  
Plasma clearance of avapritinib was low in mouse and rat and moderate in dog and monkey. The apparent 
volume of distribution at steady state was moderate to high in all species, which is indicative of extensive 
tissue distribution.  
Plasma protein binding is high (>99 %) across all species tested and given the small differences between 
dog and human, there is no need to compare free concentrations between these species. The 2-3 fold 
higher unbound fraction in rat plasma compared to human plasma may however be relevant to consider 
in calculation of exposure margins between rat and human.  
Avapritinib was distributed widely to most tissues in rats, including the brain. This finding is of relevance 
to consider in relation to the serious avapritinib associated adverse CNS effects observed in dogs and 
patients. The distribution of [14C]-avapritinib-related radioactivity in nonpigmented rats was the highest 
in the lung, adrenal gland, and liver, and was the lowest in uveal tract and adipose. Distribution to target 
organs  for  GIST  and  metastases  (stomach  wall,  small  intestine  and  large  intestine)  is  confirmed. 
Avapritinib also showed a potential affinity to melanin-containing tissues such as skin and uveal tract in 
pigmented male Long Evans rats. 
Avapritinib  metabolism  is  mainly  mediated  by  CYP3A4  and  by  CYP2C9  to  a  minor  extent.  In  vitro 
metabolism of avapritinib in human, rat, and dog hepatocytes occurred via phase I metabolic pathways 
and was characterized by oxidation, N-demethylation, and oxidative deamination. There were no unique 
metabolites  observed  in  vitro  in  human  hepatocytes  or  liver  microsomes.  One  of  the  major  human 
metabolites (M690) was only detected at trace levels in rat and dog, but it is a water-soluble phase 2 
conjugation hydroxyl glucuronide and therefore it is expected to pose minimal human safety risk. With 
respect to the other major human metabolite (M499), the exposure is a mixture of two pharmacologically 
active  enantiomers,  BLU111207  (R)  and  BLU111208  (S).  The  (S)-  and  (R)-enantiomers  are  3.1-  and 
10.5-fold less potent against KIT D816V, respectively. Exposure to both enantiomers in rat and dog can 
be anticipated, but the relative exposure to the S- and R-form has not been determined. This is however 
not  considered  to  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  calculation  of  exposure  margins  since  the 
pharmacological activity of both enantiomers is lower than for the parent compound. Furthermore, the 
ratio avapritinib/M499 in dog plasma is lower than the ratio in human plasma. In conclusion, all important 
human avapritinib metabolites are considered qualified from a non-clinical point of view. 
Pattern  of  excretion  has  only  been  investigated  in  rat.  In  the  absence  of  toxicity  to  kidneys  or  renal 
function in either rat or dog, there are however no signals of species related differences. Consequently, 
the lack of an excretion study in dog is acceptable. Biliary excretion was the major route of elimination 
with a minor contribution by active gut secretion in rats. 
There  is  no  information  available  on  excretion  of  avapritinib  or  metabolites  into  milk.  Adequate 
information and warnings have been included in section 4.6 of the SmPC. 
The  adverse  effects  noted  in  rats  and  dogs  were  generally  comparable  (including  metabolic 
perturbations, and inanition, reduced hematopoiesis and lymphopoiesis and effects in the gonads and 
adrenal  gland)  and  likely  pharmacologically  driven.  Key  exceptions  were  that  rats  (and  not  dogs) 
manifested convulsions, potentially secondary to inhibition of Nav 1.2. 
The potential for avapritinib to induce seizures in rats was monitorable with EEG and ameliorated with 
the  anti-convulsive  drug,  diazepam.  Despite  the  risk  of  convulsions  in  humans  seem  low,  the  risk 
management  plan  (RMP)  describes  two  non-serious  events  of  seizure  and  epilepsy  reported  in  two 
patients and thus, related findings in rats are described in section 5.3 of the SmPC.

Repeat dose studies in dogs indicated haemorrhage and choroid plexus oedema in the brain at ≥ 0.4 
times the human exposure at the clinical dose of 300 mg once daily. Rats manifested convulsions, which 
was  potentially  secondary  to  inhibition  of  Nav  1.2  at  systemic  exposures  ≥8-fold  higher  than  the 
exposure in patients at the clinical dose of 300 mg once daily. This effect was not seen in dogs. Since 
intracranial haemorrhage has been reported as a serious adverse event in patients receiving avapritinib, 
it  is  necessary  to  clarify  the  mechanism  in  order  to  determine  potential  risk  factors  and  support  risk 
minimisation measures. The applicant has not provided data indicating that the thrombocytosis seen in 
dogs is related to ICB. In patients with AdvSM, avapritinib-induced thrombocytopenia is considered as a 
major risk factor for ICB. A similar decrease in thrombocyte number is not detected in dogs. Changes in 
vascular  integrity  through  altered  pericyte  function  induced  by  inhibition  of  PDGFRB,  is  on  the  other 
hand,  a  more  likely  cause  for  brain  haemorrhage  in  dogs  than  thrombocytosis.  This  is  based  on 
experience from other PDGFR inhibitors, and the observation that level of PDGFRB in mice brain decrease 
after avapritinib treatment. There are some obvious missing information that would help support this 
hypothesis,  such  as  data  about  changes  to  the  pericytes  in  CNS  after  avapritinib  treatment,  and  the 
susceptibility of pericytes in different tissues/organs. This is information that can be acquired in in vivo 
studies, but based on the 3R’s it is not recommended to do animal studies solely to investigate this issue. 
However, appropriate endpoints should be considered included if in vivo animal studies are initiated for 
other reasons.  
All effects were reversible or reversing with three notable exceptions: effects in the lymphoid system 
(spleen and thymus), brain and the gonads. 
Avapritinib was not genotoxic overall when tested in a panel of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies.  
Avapritinib  reduced  fetal  viability  and  caused  fetal  malformations  in  a  study  in  gravid  rats.  Adequate 
information about reproductive toxicity is included in the section 5.3 of the SmPC. Women of childbearing 
potential should be informed that avapritinib may cause foetal harm. The pregnancy status of women of 
reproductive potential should be verified prior to initiating avapritinib treatment. Women of childbearing 
potential  should  use  effective  contraception  during  treatment  and  for  1  month  after  the  last  dose  of 
avapritinib.  Patients  should  be  advised  to  contact  their  healthcare  professional  immediately  if  they 
become pregnant, or if pregnancy is suspected, while taking avapritinib (see section 4.6 of the SmPC). 
The absence of carcinogenicity studies is acceptable. Such studies are not required for a product for an 
advanced cancer indication. 
Avapritinib demonstrated the potential for phototoxicity in vitro and in vivo. According to information in 
the  RMP,  treatment  related  grade  1  or  2  photosensitivity  reactions  were  observed  in  3%  of  patients 
included in trials with avapritinib. It is noted that due to the potential for phototoxicity identified in non-
clinical studies, patients were advised to wear protecting clothing and sunscreen, and to avoid direct sun 
exposure. Taken together, a potential for phototoxicity has been established.  An in vitro phototoxicity 
study  in  3T3  mouse  fibroblasts  as  well  as  a  phototoxicity  study  in  pigmented rats  demonstrated  that 
avapritinib has a slight potential for phototoxicity.  
Nonclinical  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  studies  could  not  establish  a  model  or  a  mechanism  for  the  memory 
impairment observed in patients. 
Since the experimental value of logDow has been determined to be 3.6 for avapritinib, and this value is 
below the action limit of 4.5, a PBT assessment is not required. Based on log Dow value (3.6 at pH 7) 
and the PEC (0.0041µg/L) avapritinib is of no concern for the environment.

In addition to the listed studies, there is an ongoing Phase III study (Study BLU-285-1303, the 
VOYAGER study) where avapritinib is compared to regorafenib in patients with GIST who have 
progressed on imatinib and sunitinib. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Analytical Methods 
Validated LC/MS-MS assays were used in all clinical studies for determining concentrations of avapritinib 
(BLU-285) and the constituent enantiomers BLU111207 and BLU111208 of the pharmacologically active 
metabolite M499 (BLU136707) in human plasma. All bioanalytical methods were validated successfully. 
The LTS does cover the maximum storage period for avapritinib, although the LTS of 558 days does not 
cover the maximum storage period of 765 days for the enantiomers. The applicant should provide in the 
Q1 2021 the LTS to cover the maximum storage period of 765 days for the enantiomers (See section on 
post authorization measures including recommendations). 
The  in-study  validation  shows  acceptable  calibration  standards  and  QCs  and  the  reasons  for  the  re-
analysis of samples are considered acceptable. 
The  incurred  sample  re-analysis  was  performed  for BLU-285  in  all  clinical  studies  and  for  BLU111207 
and BLU111208 in study BLU-285-1101. The ISR results were acceptable since at least 66.7% of the 
samples re-analysed were within the acceptance range (± 20%) for all analytes in all studies. 
Absorption  
•  Bioavailability 
Across the dose range of single doses of 30 to 400 mg in patients with GIST in Study BLU-285-1101, 
avapritinib was rapidly absorbed following oral administration in patients with GIST, with a median 
Tmax of 2.0 to 4.1 hours after single-dose administration.  
Assessment report  
EMA/451735/2020  
Page 52/144 
 
 
 
 
After a single oral dose of approximately 310 mg (100 μCi) [14C]avapritinib in healthy subjects, the 
mean radioactive dose recovery was 88.2% (70.3% feces and 17.9% urine). Metabolic profiling of 
pooled fecal homogenates (representing > 90% of fecal excretion) indicated that 59.6% of the 
radioactive dose was recovered in feces (11.0% unchanged avapritinib). Subtracting the fecal 
excretion portion of avapritinib (11.0%) from the overall recovered dose (59.6%), and taking into 
account (adding) the excretion of unchanged avapritinib in urine (14.4%), suggests that at least 70% 
of the total administered dose of avapritinib is absorbed. This conservative estimate for the degree of 
absorption indicates that avapritinib exhibits moderate-to-high intestinal permeability. 
•  Bioequivalence 
•  Influence of food 
Avapritinib Cmax and AUCinf were increased by 59% and 27%, respectively, in healthy subjects 
administered avapritinib after a high fat meal (approximately 909 calories, 58 grams carbohydrate, 56 
grams fat and 43 grams protein) compared to the Cmax and AUCinf after overnight fasting. 
Assessment report  
EMA/451735/2020

Distribution 
Extensive in vitro plasma protein binding of avapritinib was observed in human plasma (98.8% at 
nominal concentrations of 1 and 10 μM). Plasma protein binding was comparable in human plasma 
from healthy volunteers and subjects with severe renal impairment.  No concentration-dependence in 
binding was observed. Avapritinib was minimally associated with human red blood cells in vitro; the 
human blood-to-plasma ratio was 0.95. In patients with GIST, following a single 300 mg oral dose of 
avapritinib, the geometric mean apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) of avapritinib was 17 L/kg, 
indicating extensive distribution into tissues from plasma. 
Elimination 
•  Excretion 
After single-dose administration of avapritinib across the dose range of 30 to 400 mg in patients with 
GIST, the mean t1/2 was long, ranging from 32 to 57 hours. The geometric mean CL/F ranged 
between 17.2 and 28.6 L/h after the single-dose administration of avapritinib and between 17.3 to 
24.6 L/h after repeat-dose administration, indicating that avapritinib is a low clearance drug. Following 
oral administration of avapritinib 300 mg once daily, the steady state geometric mean apparent oral 
clearance (CL/F) was 19.5 L/h.

Following a single oral dose of approximately 310 mg (~100 µCi) [14C]avapritinib to healthy subjects, 
70% of the radioactive dose was recovered in faeces and 18% excreted in urine. Unchanged 
avapritinib accounted for 11% and 0.23% of the administered radioactive dose excreted in faeces and 
urine, respectively (see section 5.2 of the SmPC).

Pharmacokinetics of metabolites 
Following administration of single oral doses of avapritinib ranging from 30 to 400 mg, BLU111207 and 
BLU111208 formation was rapid, with quantifiable concentrations at approximately 0.5 hours postdose. 
The median Tmax for BLU111207 and BLU111208 ranged from 3.0 to 24 hours and 3.0 to 16 hours 
postdose, respectively, across dose levels. The mean apparent terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of 
BLU111207 and BLU111208 ranged from 36 to 65 hours and 37 to 90 hours postdose, respectively. 
Following repeat QD dosing of avapritinib 30 to 400 mg, the observed geometric mean accumulation 
ratio for BLU111207 and BLU111208 ranged from 3.1 to 14.3 and 4.4 to 15.7, respectively.

Concomitant PPI use was included as a covariate on F, as shown below: 
where GISTF was the covariate effect of being a GIST patient on F (see Section 3.5.1.3), and PPIF is 
the estimated covariate effect of concomitant PPI use, where it is 1 if there was no concomitant PPI 
use (0 to less than 5 consecutive days of PPI use prior to the PK sample), and 0.769 if there was equal 
or more than 5 consecutive days of PPI use prior to the PK sample.  
Patient population was included as a covariate on F, as shown in Equation 2, where GISTF was set to 1 
for healthy volunteers, and estimated to be 0.846 for patients with GIST.  
Formulation of avapritinib was included as a covariate on KTR, as shown in the equation below:

Tumour growth model development 
Tumor size was modeled using the SLD of all target lesions, with data measured across study BLU-
285-1101 at baseline (before start the treatment), and thereafter every 6 – 8 weeks during treatment. 
The TGI model was used to describe tumor growth and is shown by the following differential equation 
where SLD(t) is the tumor SLD at time t. The TGI model assumes that, in the absence of treatment, 
tumor SLD increases exponentially according to a disease-specific first-order growth rate constant 
(kgrowth). Drug-related tumor shrinkage is accounted for by drug exposure and a drug-specific kill rate 
constant (kkill). A decrease in drug effect is described by a time-dependent mono-exponential function, 
the resistance rate (λ) parameter. The parameter is assumed to start at the start of treatment and to 
be independent of the dosing schedule and drug exposure.

• 
Impaired renal function 
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, avapritinib exposures were similar among 88 subjects 
with mild renal impairment (CLcr 60-89 mL/min), 24 subjects with moderate renal impairment (CLcr 
30-59 mL/min) and 230 subjects with normal renal function (CLcr ≥90 mL/min), suggesting that no 
dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment.  The PK of 
avapritinib in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr 15 to 29 mL/min) or end-stage renal disease 
(CLcr < 15 mL/min) has not been studied.

subjects with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin within upper limit of normal [ULN] and AST > 
ULN or total bilirubin >1 to 1.5 times ULN and any AST), 6 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment 
(total bilirubin >1.5 to 3.0 times ULN and any AST), and 284 subjects with normal hepatic function

(total bilirubin and AST within ULN). The PK of avapritinib in patients with severe (total bilirubin > 3.0 
× ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment has not been studied. 
•  Gender 
PopPK modelling showed that gender did not influence avapritinib PK. 
•  Race 
PopPK modelling showed that race did not influence avapritinib PK. 
•  Weight 
The median value of the 95% PI in patients with low lean body weight (30 kg) showed a 25% increase 
in Cmax, suggesting that half of the patients with low lean body weight will show exposure changes 
greater than ±30%. Nevertheless, considering that %CV in Cmax and AUC was 52.2 and 48.3% in 
patients receiving avapritinib 300 mg QD, its impact in patients with low lean body weight might be of 
minor relevance.   
•  Elderly 
PopPK modelling showed that age did not influence avapritinib PK.

Children 
No clinical study with avapritinib has been conducted in children. The PK of alpelisib in children is 
unknown. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
• 
In vitro 
Effect of Avapritinib on the Pharmacokinetics of CYP450 substrates 
In vitro studies with recombinant human CYP450 enzymes demonstrated that avapritinib Phase I 
metabolism is predominantly mediated by CYP3A4, and to a minor extent by CYP2C9 
The potential of avapritinib to inhibit the major CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5) in vitro in human liver microsomes was evaluated. Avapritinib 
inhibited CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, and CYP2C19 with IC50 values ≥ 28 μM. IC50 values for inhibition 
of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4/5 in vitro were 15.2 μM (inhibition constant [Ki] = 11.9 μM), 29.9 μM 
(testosterone 6β-hydroxylation), and 21.6 μM (midazolam 1’-hydroxylation). The R1 values for CYP2C9

and CYP3A4 inhibition and R1, gut value for CYP3A4 inhibition for avapritinib are either at or above the 
threshold for a potential clinical drug-drug interaction (R1 ≥ 1.02 and R1,gut >11).  
Avapritinib was not a time-dependent inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or 
CYP2D6 catalyzed activities in vitro; however, avapritinib demonstrated time-dependent inhibition of 
CYP3A4 activity with a maximal inactivation rate constant (Kinact)and the inhibitor concentration 
causing half-maximal inactivation [KI] of 0.0301 min-1 and 12.3 μM, respectively. The estimated R2 
value is above the threshold for a potential drug-drug interaction (≥ 1.25). 
Effect of Avapritinib on the Pharmacokinetics of Transporter substrates 
In vitro, avapritinib (0.03 to 10 μM) did not significantly inhibit human organic anion transporting 
polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1), human organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B3 (OATP1B3), organic 
anion transporter 1 (OAT1), organic anion transporter 3 (OAT3), organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) 
or organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2), hence the likelihood of drug-drug interactions at clinically 
relevant concentrations is considered to be low. In vitro IC50 values for inhibition of P-gp, BCRP, bile 
salt export pump (BSEP), multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 1 (MATE1), and multidrug toxin and 
extrusion protein 2-K (MATE2-K) by avapritinib were 0.696, 3.67, 2.59, 0.825, and 0.128 μM, 
respectively. Estimated intestinal luminal concentration of drug (Igut)/IC50 values for P-gp and BCRP 
and maximal unbound plasma concentration of drug (Imax,u)/IC50 values for MATE1 and MATE2-K 
exceeded the regulatory threshold of > 10 and > 0.02, respectively. Avapritinib may have the potential 
for drug-drug interactions with P-gp, BCRP, MATE1, and MATE2-K substrates.

Effect of Gastric Acid Reducing Agents on the Pharmacokinetics of Avapritinib 
The established PBPK model adequately simulated the plasma concentration-time profiles of avapritinib 
after a single oral dose of 200 mg in healthy subjects in the fasted state, and avapritinib exposure 
metrics were within 1.1-fold of observed data. The simulated effect of food on the PK of a single oral 
dose of 200 mg avapritinib in healthy subjects was also consistent with the observed data: the AUC 
ratio (fed to fast) was 1.26 (predicted) versus 1.28 (observed); the Cmax ratio (fed to fast) was 1.59 
(predicted) versus 1.51 (observed), respectively. The model was then qualified using PK profiles from 
patients with GIST. The PBPK model was able to recover the plasma concentration-time profiles and 
exposure levels of avapritinib after a single and repeat oral dose of 300 or 400 mg QD in patients with 
GIST in the fasted state, and were within 1.25-fold of observed data, thus validating the accuracy of 
the model. 
The most common PPI taken by patients with GIST in Study BLU-285-1101 was omeprazole, which has 
been shown to be associated with elevated gastric pH values of 3.6 to 4.5 (Miner et al, 2003; Dodd et 
al, 2019). Hence, the verified PBPK model was subsequently applied to assess the impact of increase in 
gastric pH (range: 3.5 to 4.8) on the PK/fraction absorbed of avapritinib via manipulation of system 
parameters. The model predicted a 1.23- to 2.16-fold change in fraction absorbed of avapritinib as a 
consequence of elevating gastric pH. The discrepancy in the results of the sensitivity analysis versus 
results of the population PK and NCA PK analyses may be partially explained by the elevated gastric pH 
associated with gastric/intestinal cancer. A significant increase in mean gastric pH values from 2.9 in 
healthy subjects (n = 165) to 6.6 in patients with gastric/intestinal cancer (n = 89) has been reported 
(Lu et al, 2010). Thus, patients with cancer may have smaller PPI effects, compared to healthy 
subjects, due to an elevated gastric pH.

In vivo 
Effect of CYP3A4 inhibitors on the Pharmacokinetics of Avapritinib 
Avapritinib Phase I metabolism is predominantly mediated by CYP3A4, so strong CYP3A inhibitors may 
affect the plasma exposure of avapritinib. In a clinical drug-drug interaction study, coadministration of 
Assessment report  
EMA/451735/2020  
Page 70/144 
 
 
 
 
itraconazole (200 mg twice daily on Day 1 followed by 200 mg QD for 13 days), a strong CYP3A 
inhibitor, with a single 200 mg dose of avapritinib increased avapritinib Cmax by 1.4-fold and AUC0–∞ 
by 4.2-fold, relative to a 200 mg dose of avapritinib administered alone. 
The concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors, including grapefruit or grapefruit juice, with 
avapritinib should be avoided. 
Effect of CYP3A4 inducers on the Pharmacokinetics of Avapritinib 
Avapritinib Phase I metabolism is predominantly mediated by CYP3A4, so CYP3A inducers may affect 
the plasma exposure of avapritinib. In a clinical drug-drug interaction study, coadministration of 
rifampin (600 mg QD for 18 days), a strong CYP3A inducer, with a single 400 mg dose of avapritinib 
decreased avapritinib Cmax by 74% and AUC0-∞ by 92%, relative to a 400 mg dose of avapritinib 
administered alone. 
The concomitant use of strong and moderate CYP3A inducers, including St. John’s Wort, should be 
avoided. 
Effect of Gastric Acid Reducing Agents on the Pharmacokinetics of Avapritinib 
Coadministration of avapritinib with drugs that elevate the gastric pH was not evaluated in a clinical 
drug-drug interaction study. However, altered avapritinib absorption that is clinically significant or 
relevant was not observed in patients with GIST in Study BLU-285-1101. Seventy seven out of 221 
patients (34.8%) had concomitant PPI use for ≥ 5 consecutive days during the analysis period. The 
effect of concomitant PPI use, as defined by the event level classification system, was determined to 
be 0.736 (95% PI, 0.263 to 1.95) for AUC and 0.725 (95% PI, 0.261 to 1.98) for Cmax. Overall, the 
magnitude of the effect on avapritinib AUC and Cmax was minor (< 0.5-fold change) and is not 
considered clinically relevant when taking into consideration the observed interindividual variability in 
steady state PK in patients receiving 300 mg QD (%CV for Cmax and AUC of 52.2% and 48.3%, 
respectively). A significant increase in mean gastric pH values from 2.9 in healthy subjects (n = 165) 
to 6.6 in patients with gastric/intestinal cancer (n = 89) has been reported (Lu et al, 2010). Thus, 
cancer patients may have smaller PPI effects, compared to healthy subjects, due to an elevated gastric 
pH. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Avapritinib has been developed as a type 1 kinase inhibitor to selectively inhibit oncogenic KIT and 
PDGFRα mutants by targeting the kinase active conformation. In particular, the potential of avapritinib 
to inhibit KIT and PDGFRα mutants resistant to tyrosine kinase inhibitors already approved for 
treatment of GIST has been investigated. 
Nearly 80% of GIST patients have a primary activating mutation in KIT exon 9 or 11. These tumours 
initially respond well to imatinib therapy, but secondary resistance mutations in the KIT may develop 
and result in relapse. Secondary KIT resistance mutations include mutations in KIT exon 17 (mutations 
at the D816 position, among others) and are found with increasing frequency after imatinib and 
second-line sunitinib treatment (Heinrich et al., 2008; Antonescu et al., 2005; Leigl et al., 2008). In 
the 10-15% of GIST driven by PDGFRα, the most common mutations occur in exon 18, particularly the 
D842V substitution in exon 18 (Corless et al., 2005; Cassier et al., 2012). This mutation is structurally 
similar to the KIT exon 17 D816V mutant and is found in 5% of unresectable or metastatic GIST

patients (Cassier et al., 2012). Furthermore, PDGFRα D842V mutant GIST is insensitive to imatinib and 
all other agents approved for GIST (Cassier et al., 2012).  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology  
Primary pharmacology 
In the E-R analyses for Study BLU-285-1101, the relationship of a number of PK exposure variables 
(Steady state [C1D15] Cmax, C24 & AUC0−τ) to efficacy and safety endpoints was examined. Due to 
multiple dose adjustments during treatment, systemic exposure at steady state (C1D15) was not 
considered to truly represent the individual patient avapritinib exposure prior to an adverse event (AE) 
or measure of efficacy. Subsequently, a model predicted average plasma concentration (Cave) was 
derived from the start of treatment until the first occurrence of an event of interest as detailed below. 
Avapritinib cumulative area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUCcum) and Cave were 
required for each patient at each day of study participation. 
The model predicted Cave for efficacy (progression-free survival [PFS], duration of response [DOR] 
and overall response rate [ORR]) was calculated as AUCcum,event/duration of event/24 h. The model 
predicted Cave used in the safety analysis was calculated as AUCcum,AE/treatment duration/24 h. 
Treatment duration was defined as the number of days between the first dose of avapritinib and the 
first occurrence of the AE of interest. If the patient did not experience the AE of interest throughout the 
study, the treatment duration was defined as the number of days of study participation. For change 
from baseline hemoglobin and bilirubin, treatment duration was defined as the number of days 
between the first dose of avapritinib and the final hemoglobin or bilirubin observation. 
Secondary pharmacology 
Avapritinib had a small effect on the QTc interval at steady state plasma concentrations after 
administration at doses of 300/400 mg QD. The mean baseline QTcF (on Day 1) was 411.9 ms. On Day 
15 (steady state), the mean change from baseline in QTcF (ΔQTcF) was 7.0 ms at the predose time 
point, and above 5 ms at all postdose time points except 4 hours postdose (4.6 ms) (Figure 7). The 
largest mean ΔQTcF was observed at 1 hour (9.9 ms) and 8 hours (9.5 ms) postdose. Only 3 patients 
had a ΔQTcF of > 30 ms, and no patients had a ΔQTcF of > 60 ms (BLU-285-1101, Cardiac Safety 
Report, Section 5.3). No patients had a QTcF of > 450 ms. 
The observed mean plasma concentrations were similar for the 300 and 400 mg QD treatments (BLU-
285-1101, Cardiac Safety Report). For the combined data from both dose levels (ie, at clinical doses of 
300/400 mg QD), mean plasma concentrations of avapritinib at steady state (Day 15) were 
substantially higher than on Day 1 (Figure 7), with the more than 3-fold accumulation observed on Day 
15 being consistent with the long half-life of avapritinib (Section 2.1.1). On Day 15, the peak mean 
Assessment report

Page 72/144 
 
 
 
plasma concentration was observed at 4 hours postdose.
This analysis confirmed observations in a by-time point analysis, with a very shallow but statistically 
significant positive slope (0.007 ms per ng/mL [90% CI: 0.003, 0.012]) and a small, statistically 
nonsignificant intercept (-0.2 ms [90% CI: -2.26, 1.89]) (BLU-285-1101, Cardiac Safety Report). The 
predicted ΔQTcF effect using this model was 6.55 ms (90% CI: 1.80, 11.29) at the steady state 
geometric mean Cmax of avapritinib (899 ng/mL). A mean QT effect (ΔQTcF) exceeding 20 ms can be 
excluded at avapritinib plasma concentrations up to 1645 ng/mL. 
Avapritinib at clinical doses of 300/400 mg QD had no effect on cardiac conduction (pulse rate and QRS 
intervals). Mean change from baseline pulse rate varied between -2.8 and 1.5 ms on Day 1 and 
between -3.8 and 0.5 ms on Day 15 (BLU-285-1101 Cardiac Safety Report, Section 5.4). Mean change 
from baseline QRS (ΔQRS) varied between -1.3 and 0.2 ms across all time points on both study days. 
There were no pulse rate or QRS outliers. 
In conclusion, avapritinib administered at clinical doses of 300/400 mg QD resulted in a small increase 
in QTc that was not clinically relevant. The estimated mean ΔQTcF was 6.55 ms (90% CI: 1.80 to 
11.29 ms) at the observed steady state geometric mean avapritinib Cmax of 899 ng/mL. A QT effect 
(ΔQTcF) exceeding 20 ms can be excluded at avapritinib plasma concentrations up to 1645 ng/mL. No 
effect on heart rate or cardiac conduction was observed.

•  Overall Response Rate 
Overall, the ORR was > 80% in patients with PDGFRA D842V mutation. Therefore, interpretation of the 
E-R relationship is challenging because the majority of patients are in the partial response (PR) group 
(n = 43, Figure below).

•  Progression Free Survival 
No significant relationship in median PFS (p-value > 0.05, log-rank test) was evident in the PDGFRA 
D842V mutation or 4L+ non-D842V patient subpopulation by age, BSA, sex, prior number of unique 
TKIs, race, region, and baseline tumor size (plots not shown). A trend of shorter PFS with higher ECOG 
performance was evident (Figure 27 in the 201802I E-R report), although subject numbers are low and 
these results should be interpreted with caution.

Duration of Response 
Kaplan-Meier curves of DOR by quartiles of Cave and analysis subpopulation are displayed in Figure 2. 
As the DOR analysis was restricted to a subset of patients with confirmed CR or PR, patient numbers 
were limited. A possible difference in DOR was observed between the 1st and 2nd quartile of Cave to the 
3rd and 4th quartile of Cave in the patients with PDGFRA D842V mutation, however should be interpreted 
with caution due to limited subject numbers.  
Kaplan-Meier curves of DOR for patients with PDGFRA D842V mutation stratified by covariates were 
explored. No significant relationship in DOR was evident by BSA, age group, sex, prior number of 
unique TKIs, race, region, or baseline tumor size. A significant trend was evident in DOR was evident 
when stratifying by baseline ECOG performance status, although subject numbers are low and these 
results should be interpreted with caution.

•  Grade 3 or 4 Adverse Events 
Kaplan-Meier curves of time to first Grade 3 or 4 AE by quartiles of Cave, stratified by analysis 
population, are shown in Figure 13. A clear trend was observed in both subpopulations, with a median 
time to a Grade 3 or 4 AE of approximately 10 months for the 1st quartile of Cave and approximately 2 
to 3 months for the 4th quartile of Cave. The empiric probabilities of Grade 3 or 4 AEs by quartiles of 
Cave at 3, 6, and 9 months, stratified by analysis population, are presented in Table 13. 
Differences in time to event between the subpopulations were observed for Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, race, region, and sex; however, none of the differences 
appeared to be clinically relevant or the sample size was too low to be confident in an interpretation of 
the results. There was no significant relationship (p > 0.05, log-rank test) between time to first Grade 
3 or 4 AE and BSA, age groups, race, prior number of unique tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), and 
baseline tumor size in either subpopulation. 
•  All Cognitive Effects 
Boxplots of all cognitive effect AEs (all grades) versus Cave stratified by analysis populations are 
shown in Figure 14. A trend was evident between an increased Cave and the occurrence of a cognitive 
effect AE at any stage throughout the study. The trend was greater in the 4L+ subpopulation. No clear 
trends were evident between steady state (C1D15) exposure metrics and the occurrence of a cognitive 
effect AE in either subpopulation. 
Kaplan-Meier curves of time to first cognitive effect AE (all grades) by quartiles of Cave, stratified by 
PDGFRA exon 18 mutation and 4L+ subpopulations, are shown in Figure 15. A clear trend was evident 
in the 4L+ subpopulation, with a median time to a cognitive effect AE of approximately 4 to 5 months 
for the 3rd and 4th quartiles of exposure compared to approximately15 months for the 2nd quartile of 
exposure, with few patients in the 1st quartile of Cave experience a cognitive effect. The relationship 
Assessment report

for the time to first cognitive effect AE was less clear in the PDGFRA exon 18 mutation subpopulation. 
The empiric probabilities of all cognitive effects AE (all grades) by quartiles of Cave at 3, 6, and 9 
months, stratified by analysis population, are presented in Table 14. 
•  Edema 
Kaplan-Meier curves of time to first Grade 2 or higher edema AE by quartiles of Cave, stratified by 
PDGFRA exon 18 mutation and 4L+ subpopulations, are shown in Figure 17. A trend was apparent in 
the 4L+ subpopulation, with a faster onset of any Grade 2 or higher edema AE associated with a higher 
avapritinib Cave. However, no relationship was present in the PDGFRA exon 18 mutation 
subpopulation. The empiric probabilities of grouped edema AE (Grade 2+) by quartiles of Cave at 3, 6, 
and 9 months, stratified by analysis population, are presented in Table 15. 
Full details of the exposure-response analyses of Grade 2 or higher edema events by predefined 
covariates are available in E-R Report BLUE201802 Section 10.3.1. Kaplan-Meier curves of time to the 
first Grade 2 or higher edema AE by region showed a significant relationship in the 4L+ subpopulation. 
Patients from Europe appeared to have a faster time to a Grade 2 or higher edema AE compared with 
patients from the US or Asia. However, the effect may be in part due to differences in average 
avapritinib exposure. Additionally, in the PDGFRA exon 18 mutation subpopulation, a significant 
relationship was present between time to the first Grade 2 or higher edema AE by baseline ECOG 
performance status. Patients with a baseline ECOG performance status of 0 appeared to have a faster 
onset than patients with a baseline ECOG performance status of 1. The effect appeared to be largely 
independent of avapritinib exposure. 
•  Hemoglobin and Bilirubin 
In both subpopulations, a possible trend was apparent with an increase in change from baseline 
bilirubin as Cave increased. Additionally, a change from baseline was apparent at lower Cave, 
indicating the possibility of disease progression and liver involvement rather than an avapritinib 
exposure effect. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Avapritinib has been characterized using in vitro and in vivo data from several clinical trials. The 
methodology applied to characterize the pharmacokinetics and interactions through non-
compartmental analysis and population approach is mainly endorsed.  
Absorption 
The information given in the SmPC describes only the time to reach Cmax and should be updated to 
reflect that the absolute bioavailability has not been determined.   
Formulation bridge and food effect 
Two biopharmaceutical studies have been performed in healthy individuals: A 6% to 10% lower 
exposure (Cmax, AUC0-24, AUC0-72) was observed for the 200 mg tablet compared to the 2 x 100 mg 
capsules in study BLU-285-0101. The AUC parameters were contained within the acceptance limits of 
0.8-1.25, however Cmax was not (90%CI: 78.5-102.7). Bioequivalence between the 100 mg and 400 
mg tablet strengths was demonstrated in study BLU-285-0105. A strength-based biowaiver was 
confirmed at pH 4.5 for the additional 200 and 300 mg tablets intended for marketing.  
In the food-effect study, BLU-285-0102, samples were reanalysed due to uncertainty regarding the 
terminal slopes of the time-concentration profiles, which is an obvious PK reason. Furthermore the 
applicant states that the geometric means of AUC0-24h (n=30) is similar to AUC0-inf (n=23). Firstly, 
Assessment report  
EMA/451735/2020  
Page 79/144 
 
 
 
AUC0-24h was, in contrast to AUC0-T and AUC0-inf, not a primary endpoint of the food effect study. 
Secondly, it is not possible to assess the impact of omitting 23% of the patients without doing a 
sensitivity analysis. The geometric mean ratio of the 30 individual values was 126%, showing that 
AUC0-inf increases by 26% in fed vs fasted conditions.  
Elimination 
The PK of the pharmacologically active metabolites BLU111207 and BLU111208 and the have been 
studied in GIST patients and pharmacokinetic data have been provided. The Applicant intends to 
evaluate the pharmacological activity for M690 in Q2 2020. In case the pharmacological activity index 
is greater than 20%, steady-state concentrations will be collected in patients, which seems acceptable. 
The potential impact of polymorphisms on CYP2C9 has not been further explored. The applicant argues 
that clinically relevant effects are not expected as the relative contribution of 2C9 to overall 
metabolism is minor at approximately 15%. CYP2C9 polymorphisms are likely to be one of the sources 
of intra-individual variability for avapritinib. However, as a single contributor to variability, the impact 
on the exposure levels of avapritinib is not expected to be major. The SmPC text has been updated 
with percentage per metabolizing pathway.  
The potential impact of genetic polymorphisms in CYP3A5 was investigated in an in vitro study (Report 
2001071). The study design and conduct is considered adequate for the purpose; using CYP3A5 cDNA 
expressed enzymes and human liver microsomes (HLM) of various CYP3A5 genotypes (CYP3A5*1*1, 
*1*3, *3*3) to understand their contribution to the metabolism of avapritinib. The study results show 
a negligent contribution of the CYP3A5 genotypes to the metabolism of avapritinib and support that 
clinical relevant effects would not be expected for CYP3A5 as single contributor to variability on 
exposure. The SmPC section 5.2 has been updated to reflect that CYP3A5 also metabolizes avapritinib.  
Overall, the polymorphisms discussed above are not expected to majorly impact the exposure levels of 
avapritinib as single contributors to variability. However, genetic polymorphisms are likely to contribute 
to the inter-individual variability of avapritinib. The relative impact of the various polymorphisms have 
not been investigated and can accordingly not be used longside the other source of variability for 
avapritinib PK to inform an individualized dosing algorithm. This should be reflected in the EPAR in 
order to allow both a reflection of the current knowledge and the gaps in knowledge as well as inform 
potentially personalized dosing algorithms or TDM studies. 
The applicant should provide in the Q1 2021 the LTS to cover the maximum storage period of 765 days 
for the enantiomers (See section on post authorization measures including recommendations). 
To better understand the metabolizing pathways leading to glucuronidation for avapritinib an in vitro 
study (BLU-R8399) was conducted. The study design and conduct is considered adequate for the 
explorative purpose. The study indicates that the CYP3A4 formed metabolite M514 is further converted 
to the glucuronide and could also be the precursor to a carbocation intermediate which can undergo 
reaction with water to form M499. The applicant argues that the results indicate that any downward-
regulation of glucuronidation rate of M514 to M690 due the genetic polymorphism will shift the 
metabolism toward the formation of M499 (no activity) and major impact on exposure levels are not 
expected from UGT polymorphisms as single source of variability. The relative percentage that is 
metabolized per pathway has not been determined. Further, M690 is a major metabolite and the 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacological properties of M690 is largely unknown. The applicant conducted 
in vitro studies of avapritinib hydroxylamine (M514) with human rUGTs that suggested that the 
formation of the glucuronide M690 is catalyzed mainly by UGT1A3, but also UGT1A4 and UGT2B7 to a 
lesser extent.  
Population pharmacokinetic models 
Assessment report  
EMA/451735/2020  
Page 80/144 
 
 
 
Model building and evaluation 
A population PK model for avapritinib following oral administration was developed using data from 4 
Phase 1 studies consisting of both healthy volunteers and patients with GIST. The PK of avapritinib was 
best described by a two compartment model, with absorption described using 4 or 5 transit 
compartments, depending upon formulation of tablets or capsules, respectively. LBW on Vc/F, capsule 
formulation on transit time, GIST patients and concomitant PPI administration on bioavailability were 
identified as the main significant covariates. The final population PK model seems able to describe the 
observed data. 
Intra-patient variability (between-occasion variability) in apparent oral clearance (CL/F) and volume of 
the central compartment (Vc/F) was unknown based on the figures presented. The applicant provided 
intra-individual %CV for CL/F and VC/F, which ranged from 1.2% to 37.9% with a median of 8.9%.  
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Avapritinib demonstrated proportional pharmacokinetics in both HV and the target population. The 
population-PK analysis shows decreased BA in patients compared to HV and differences in CL between 
ethnic groups. The effect of intrinsic factors affecting the PK of avapritinib has been sparsely 
investigated.  
PK/PD model of tumour dynamics 
The applicant has presented a tumour dynamics model in patients with GIST. Simulations show that 
increasing doses may lead to median reduction in absolute (mm) and relative (%) tumour diameters. 
However, the distributions of change in tumour size are to a large extent overlapping between the 100 
mg, 200 mg and 300 mg doses.  
Renal impairment 
Dedicated clinical study investigating the impact of renal impairment have not been conducted. Based 
on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, no dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild 
and moderate renal impairment [creatinine clearance (CLcr) 30-89 mL/min estimated by Cockcroft-
Gault]. Avapritinib has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr 15-29 mL/min) 
or end-stage renal disease (CLcr <15 mL/min), therefore its use in patients with severe renal 
impairment or end-stage renal disease cannot be recommended (see sections 4.2 and 5.2 of the 
SmPC). 
Impaired hepatic function 
As hepatic elimination is a major route of excretion for avapritinib, hepatic impairment may result in 
increased plasma avapritinib concentrations. Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, no dose 
adjustment is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin within upper limit 
of normal [ULN] and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > ULN or total bilirubin greater than 1 to 1.5 
times ULN and any AST) and moderate hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >1.5 to 3.0 times ULN and 
any AST). Avapritinib has not been studied in subjects with severe (Child-Pugh class C) hepatic 
impairment and therefore its use in patients with severe hepatic impairment cannot be recommended 
(see sections 4.2 and 5.2 of the SmPC). A dedicated study in hepatic impairment will be conducted to 
evaluate the pharmacokinetics of avapritinib in hepatically impaired subjects  and the results will 
become available in Q1 2024 (see section on Post Authorization Measures and RMP).  
Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicate that age, race, sex, body weight, and albumin 
concentration have no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of avapritinib. No dose 
adjustment is recommended for patients aged 65 years and above. 
Interactions 
Assessment report  
EMA/451735/2020  
Page 81/144 
 
 
 
In vitro 
There are some limitations in the conducted in vitro studies. 
Estimation of intestinal luminal concentration (Igut), maximal unbound plasma concentration (Imax,u) 
and maximal unbound hepatic inlet concentration (Iu,inlet,max) is poorly described. Additional 
information was requested from the applicant at D120. For instance, the applicant concluded that the 
R1 value for CYP2C9 inhibition by avapritinib is either at or above the threshold for a potential clinical 
drug-drug interaction (R1 ≥ 1.02), whereas the assessors found the R1 value to be below the 
threshold. This was clarified (R<1) along with several aspects on the interaction potential of 
avapritinib.  
In vivo 
Victim: 
The conducted clinical DDI study investigated the effect of CYP3A/p-gp inhibition and induction, 
however at different dose levels than intended for clinical use. The effect of a strong inhibitor was 
investigated at a lower dose (200 mg) and the effect of a strong inducer was investigated at a higher 
dose (400mg). The applicant has discussed this deviation from Guideline requirements and has built a 
PBPK model to estimate the effect of strong inhibitors and inducers at 300mg, estimate the interaction 
at steady state vs single dose as well as to estimate the effect of concomitant use of moderate 
inducers and inhibitors. The SmPC has been updated to include a recommendation of avoiding the 
concomitant use of avapritinib with strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors/inducers or in case 
moderate CYP3A inhibitors use cannot be avoided, to reduce the starting dose of avapritinib to 100 mg 
orally once daily. 
Perpetrator: 
In vitro data demonstrate that avapritinib may have the potential for DDIs with P-gp, BCRP, MATE1 
and MATE2-K substrates. The Applicant recognized the value of glucose monitoring to prevent any 
hypoglycemic event in patients. (SmPC section 5.2). 
The combined inhibition and induction of CYP3A4 by avapritinib is difficult to interpret based on the in 
vitro data alone. The Applicant has planned to conduct a post-authorization DDI study to assess the 
effect of concomitant inhibition and induction of CYP3A4 by avapritinib. Results will be expcted in Q2 
2024 (refer to post authorization measures section). 
Dose 
The applicant states that “vigilant dose modification is important for improvement/resolution to 
improve tolerability” is needed. Of 28 patients initiating therapy with 300 mg dose, only 5 patients 
(18%) could maintain the dose without interruption or dose reduction. It is worrisome that 80% of 
patients have to develop toxicities for the dosing to be reduced. The current strategy of starting at 300 
mg, wait for toxicity, and then reduce the dose, is not considered optimal.  
Avapritinib has a large interpatient PK variability, with an 8-10 fold range in the exposure following 300 
mg doses. The applicant has simulated if this affects the efficacy in patients receiving 100 mg, 200 mg 
and 300 mg doses. For each dose level (100 mg, 200 mg and 300 mg), the 75th percentile had a 
higher probability of tumour response compared to the 25th percentile. However, the 75th percentile 
receiving 200 mg had higher efficacy than the 25th percentile receiving 300 mg. This finding supports 
that the efficacy of avapritinib can be improved by prospectively adjusting the dose according to 
exposure (therapeutic drug monitoring, TDM). 
On the other hand, there are confirmed relationships between higher avapritinib exposure and 
cognitive effects, increased bilirubin and decreased haemoglobin (Figure 3, Figure 5 and Figure 6). It 
Assessment report  
EMA/451735/2020  
Page 82/144 
 
 
 
also seems to be a relationship between steady-state exposure at day 15 and time to dose interruption 
or reduction of the 300 mg dose (Figure 7). All patients in the quartile with the lowest exposure 
withstood the 300 mg dose for 2 months, while patients in the 2nd to 4th quartile had to start reducing 
doses after 1 month, supporting that there is a relationship between higher exposure and adverse 
events leading to dose reductions. This finding, taken together with the fact that there is a high 
proportion patients with objective response, but no apparent exposure-efficacy relationship for the 
investigated dose, supports that individualised dosing according to exposure may reduce the risk of 
adverse events, while maintaining optimal efficacy. At this stage, a prospective clinical trial to test a 
TDM regimen in the small patient population with the D842V mutation seems unfeasible. The applicant 
was requested to, but has not provided substantial information for clinicians to explore the use of TDM 
in individual patients. 
QTc effect analysis 
Avapritinib had an effect on the QTc interval at steady state plasma concentrations, following once 
daily administration of 300 or 400 mg. On Day 15 (steady state), the mean ∆QTcF was 7.0 msec (90% 
CI 2.84 – 11.14) at the predose time point. The largest mean ∆QTcF was observed at 1 hour and 8 
hours postdose: 9.9 (90% CI 5.72 – 14.03) and 9.5 (90% CI 5.30 – 13.62) msec, respectively. Three 
patients had a ∆QTcF > 30 msec, and no patients had a ∆QTcF > 60 msec. No patients had a QTcF > 
450 msec. Flat T-waves were observed in 5 subjects at a total of 8 time points. 
The relationship between ∆QTcF and concentration of avapritinib was investigated by linear mixed-
effects modelling. The concentration-QTc analysis confirmed the observations in the by-time point 
analysis with a shallow, statistically significant positive slope. The predicted ∆QTcF effect using this 
model was 6.55 msec (90% CI: 1.80 to 11.29) at the steady state geometric mean Cmax of avapritinib 
(899 ng/mL). The estimated worst-case (concomitant use of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and a high fat 
meal) Cmax (582.4 ng/mL) is actually lower than the observed mean steady-state Cmax after 300 mg 
dosing (905 ng/mL; refer to clinical PK data), and is therefore not considered to be a reasonable worst-
case scenario. Considering that PK data show large variability in Cmax at steady-state, it is expected 
that a proportion of patients treated with avapritinib will reach Cmax concentrations with associated 
predicted ∆QTcF > 20 ms (within the 90% CI). The applicant has included a warning in the SmPC 
section 4.4 on the QT-prolonging potential of avapritinib.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The applicant has committed to perform a clinical CYP3A drug-drug interaction study of avapritinib and 
midazolam, and a study to evaluate the PK of avapritinib in hepatically impaired subjects. 
From the presented data, it cannot be excluded that patients would benefit from a lower starting dose, 
and it is possible that prospective individualised dosing (TDM) would lead to fewer adverse events 
while maintaining efficacy. However, from a clinical pharmacology perspective, avapritinib is 
approvable. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
Dose response study(ies) 
Study BLU-285-1101 Part 1 
A  formal  dose-finding  study  has  not  been  conducted.  The  dose  intended  for  marketing  was  selected 
based on the MTD from Part 1 of the phase 1 study (NAVIGATOR), an ongoing Phase 1, first-in-human, 
Assessment report  
EMA/451735/2020  
Page 83/144 
 
 
 
open-label  study  to  evaluate  the  safety,  tolerability,  pharmacokinetics  (PK),  pharmacodynamics  and 
efficacy of avapritinib, administered orally, in adult patients with unresectable GIST or other relapsed or 
refractory  solid  tumors.  The  study  design  consists  of  a  dose  escalation  part  (Part  1),  which  is  now 
complete, and an ongoing dose expansion (Part 2). 
The  primary  objectives  of  Part  1  were  to  determine  the  maximum  tolerated  dose  (MTD)  and 
recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of avapritinib and to determine initial safety and tolerability.  
The primary endpoints were: 
• MTD and RP2D of avapritinib 
• Overall safety profile of avapritinib, as assessed by the type, frequency, severity, timing, and 
relationship to study drug of any AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), and changes in vital signs, 
ECGs, and safety laboratory tests 
The dose escalation part of the study was designed to allow enrollment of patients with unresectable or 
metastatic  GIST  or  other  relapsed  or  refractory  solid  tumors;  however,  no  patients  with  relapsed  or 
refractory solid tumors were enrolled.  
Patients with GIST must have had disease that progressed after treatment with imatinib and at least 1 
of  the  following:  sunitinib,  regorafenib,  sorafenib,  dasatinib,  pazopanib,  or  an  experimental  kinase 
inhibitor agent, or disease with a D842V mutation in the PDGFRA gene.  
A standard 3+3 dose escalation design was employed. The first cohort of patients received avapritinib 
at a starting dose of 30 mg QD. The dose escalation increment for the first escalation step was to be a 
maximum  of  100%.  However,  if  ≥1  patient  treated  at  the  starting  dose  level  had  a  ≥Grade  2  non-
hematologic AE or a ≥ Grade 3 hematologic AE that was not clearly attributable to a cause other than 
avapritinib, then the maximum dose escalation increment for the first escalation step was to be 50%. 
All subsequent dose escalation increments were to be maximum of 50%. 
Three patients were to be enrolled initially in each cohort and an additional 3 patients (for a total of 6) 
were to be enrolled should the cohort require expansion due to a DLT. 
After the current escalation cohort was full, up to 3 additional patients, all with diagnosis of GIST, could 
have been enrolled into an enrichment cohort at a lower dose that was reviewed at a dose escalation 
meeting, and did not exceed the MTD.  
Dose-Limiting Toxicity 
Toxicities were graded and documented according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology 
Criteria  for  Adverse  Events  (NCI  CTCAE),  version  4.03.  Dose-limiting  toxicity  was  defined  as  any 
treatment-emergent AE of Grade ≥ 3 occurring during C1 and not clearly attributable to a cause other 
than avapritinib.  
Maximum Tolerated Dose 
The MTD was defined as the highest dose level at which ≤1 patient experienced DLTs in Cycle 1 during 
Part 1 of the study. At least 6 patients must have been treated at this dose in order to determine that it 
was the MTD. 
Selection of Dose for Expansion Part of the Study 
A total of 43 patients were initially treated with avapritinib 400 mg QD (MTD) in Part 2 of the study. 
However, emerging data at the time suggested a trend toward higher incidence of Grade 3 neurologic 
AEs and more dose reductions at 400 mg QD after multiple cycles of treatment. Based on these factors, 
as well as the observed exposure levels and efficacy of avapritinib at 300 mg, 300 mg QD was selected 
as the RP2D and starting dose for further enrollment. Per protocol, if avapritinib was tolerated at 300 
Assessment report  
EMA/451735/2020  
Page 84/144 
 
 
 
 
mg QD for 2 consecutive cycles and specific safety and response criteria were met, then Investigators 
could subsequently increase the patient’s dose to the MTD of 400 mg QD.  
Dose modifications 
The majority of patients needed dose modifications during the expansion part of the study, especially 
in the patients with D842V mutation (table below). In the groups of patients initiating therapy with 300 
mg and 400 mg, 20% and 22% of the patients permanently discontinued therapy due to adverse 
events. Of 84 patients starting on 300 mg QD, seven 4L+ patients increased the dose from 300 mg to 
400 mg. None of the D842V patients increased the dose from 300 mg to 400 mg.

Methods 
An open-label, multicenter study of avapritinib in adult patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST or 
other  relapsed  or  refractory  solid  tumours.  The  study  was  initiated  as  a  Phase  1,  FIH  study  but  was 
expanded with registrational intent in advanced GIST based on initial efficacy data. The study included 
a dose escalation part (Part 1) to determine the MTD and/or RP2D; and an expansion part (Part 2) to 
further  evaluate  the  safety  and  tolerability,  and  to  assess  the  clinical  efficacy  of  avapritinib  at  the 
MTD/RP2D.

Dosing was to be continuous, with no inter-cycle rest periods. 
Assessment report  
EMA/451735/2020  
Page 87/144 
 
 
 
A temporary discontinuation (up to 2 weeks) in avapritinib dosing was allowed for patients who required 
an interruption (eg, for surgery or other procedure) during the treatment period. Avapritinib was to be 
discontinued 48 hours before the procedure and resumed 48 hours after the procedure was completed. 
Objectives 
The primary objectives were: 
•  To  determine  the  ORR  by  mRECIST  version  1.1  criteria  at  the  MTD/RP2D  of  avapritinib  in 
patients with GIST who had a D842V mutation in PDGFRA. 
•  To  determine  the  ORR  by  mRECIST  version  1.1  criteria  at  the  MTD/RP2D  of  avapritinib  in 
patients with GIST that had progressed following treatment with imatinib and at least 1 other 
kinase inhibitor, and who are not known to have a D842V mutation in PDGFRA. 
•  To  determine  the  ORR  by  mRECIST  version  1.1  criteria  at  the  MTD/R2PD  of  avapritinib  in 
patients with GIST who had progressed or who experienced intolerance to imatinib, including in 
the adjuvant setting, and who had not received additional kinase inhibitor therapy and did not 
have a known D842V mutation in PDGRA. 
• To determine the safety and tolerability of avapritinib. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoints were: 
• ORR, defined as the rate of centrally confirmed CR or PR by mRECIST version 1.1 
Overall safety profile of avapritinib, as assessed by the type, frequency, severity, timing, and 
relationship  to  study  drug  of  any  AEs,  SAEs,  and  changes  in  vital  signs,  ECGs,  and  safety 
laboratory tests. 
The secondary endpoints were: 
• PK parameters of avapritinib 
• DOR, PFS, and CBR, as per mRECIST version 1.1  
• Response rate as defined by Choi Criteria 
• PFS on last prior anti-cancer therapy 
• KIT, PDGFRA, and other cancer relevant mutations present in tumor tissue at baseline and EOT 
• Change from baseline in the levels of KIT, PDGFRA, and other cancer relevant mutant allele 
fractions in peripheral blood 
Exploratory Endpoints were:  
• OS 
•  Correlation  of  baseline  KIT,  PDGFRA,  and  other  cancer  relevant  mutation  status  with 
antineoplastic activity. 
• Correlation of KIT, PDGFRA, and other cancer relevant mutant allele fractions in ctDNA with 
antineoplastic activity. 
• Levels of exploratory blood and tumor markers.

Time to response was not specified in the protocol as an exploratory endpoint but was included in the 
statistical analysis plan (SAP) as it was considered to be helpful in the interpretation of study results. 
Sample size 
Sample size calculations were carried out separately for three groups and were based on exact 
binomial tests of ORR with 90% power and assuming a 2-sided Type I error of 0.05 for each separate 
group. An ORR with a lower bound of the 95% confidence interval above the ‘Null ORR’ was considered 
clinically meaningful and to exceed expected ORR with available therapies.  
Amendment 6 (14th Feb 2017) changed the number of patients in Group 2 from “approximately 15” to 
50, when the primary objective changed from safety to ORR.  
Amendment 7 (01 Sept 2017) changed the sample size of Group 1 from 50 to 100 based on observed 
PFS of 9.3 months and 8% response rate.  
The sample size for Group 2 was changed from 50 to 31 in Amendment 8 (28th Feb. 2018) where Table 
2, section 1.4 of the protocol already presents an ORR of 71% (95% CI: 52% - 86%) based on 31 
PDGFRα D842V patients with ≥ 1 radiographic assessment.

Statistical methods 
The study data were analyzed and reported based on all patients’ data from the Part 1 dose escalation, 
and the combined Part 1 and Part 2 data by mutation type and/or line of therapy and dose levels. 
All primary analyses were conducted and presented by starting daily dose, grouped as ‘300 mg’, ‘400 
mg’, and ‘300/400 mg’ for the Safety Population and/or its subpopulations.  
Analysis Populations 
The following analysis populations were defined for the presentation of efficacy and safety data: 
• Safety Population: All patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug. This was the primary 
population for efficacy and safety analyses unless otherwise specified. Patients were analyzed 
based on the dose they received on Day 1. 
Selected analyses were conducted on subpopulations of safety population based on lines of TKI therapy 
and GIST mutation types, which were determined in the order of QIAGEN, Sysmex or PGDx, and local 
assays when available. These patients can be identified by currently available validated and standardised 
laboratory tests as well as commercially available IVD’s. 
• Fourth-line or later (4L+): all patients regardless of mutation type, who received 3 or more 
prior lines of TKI 
− Non-D842V 4L+: non-PDGFRA D842V 4L+ patients 
• Exon 18: PDGFRA exon 18 patients 
− D842V: PDGFRA D842V patients 
− QIAGEN D842V: PDGFRA D842V patients determined by the QIAGEN assay

For the 121 patients in the 4L+ population who received a 300 or 400 mg starting dose, the primary 
tumor site of GIST was stomach (34 patients, 28%) and small intestine (34 patients, 28%) at the time 
of study entry. At study entry, the largest target lesion was > 5 cm for 65%. Metastatic disease was 
reported  in  119  patients  (98%),  primarily  to  the  liver  (65%);  88%  of  patients  had  prior  surgical 
resection.  
Of them, 91% (110 patients) of the 4L+ population had KIT mutations, primarily at exon 11 (61%) and 
exon 17 (46%) and 9% (11 patients) had PDGFRA mutations at exon 18. Of the 11 patients with PDGFRA 
mutations at exon 18, 8 had PDGFRA D842V mutations and 3 had PDGFRA non-D842V mutations. 
A  total  of  40  (33%)  and  81  (67%)  patients  received  3  or  ≥  4  lines  of  prior  TKI  therapy.  The  median 
number  of  prior  TKI  therapies  was  4  (range  3  to  11)  indicating  patients  in  the  4L+  population  have 
exhausted all available treatment options with a clinical trial or palliative care remaining the only options. 
Very few patients in the 4L+ population had objective response reported with their last prior TKI therapy; 
the best response to last prior TKI therapy was PD in 44 (36%), SD in 43 (36%), PR in 4 (3%), and CR 
in 1 (< 1%) patient. 
In the population of patients with a PDGFRA D842V mutation(n=38), the demographic and baseline 
characteristics were: most patients were male (25 patients, 66%), white (25 patients, 66%), and < 65 
years of age (22 patients; 58%). The median age was 64 years and ranged from 29 to 90 years. Most 
patients (36 patients, 95%) had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 at baseline. Overall, 22 (58%) 
patients were treated at study sites in Europe, 11 (29%) patients were treated at study sites in the US, 
and 5 (13%) patients were treated at study sites in Asia. 
Baseline disease characteristics of the 38 patients with PDGFRA D842V mutations are summarized in 
Table 16. 
Assessment report

For the 38 patients with PDGFRA D842V mutations population, the primary tumor site of GIST was most 
commonly reported as the stomach (76%); the largest target lesion was > 5 cm for 55% of patients. 
Metastatic  disease  was  reported  in  37  patients  (97%)  primarily  to  the  peritoneum  (53%)  and  liver 
(50%); 90% of patients had prior surgical resection. 
Prior TKI therapies received by the PDGFRA D842V mutations population who received starting doses of 
300 or 400 mg avapritinib for the underlying malignancy are summarized in Table 17.

A total of 18 (47%), 7 (18%), 4 (11%), and 4 (14%) patients received 1, 2, 3, or ≥ 4 lines of prior TKI 
therapy; 5 (13%) of 38 patients received no prior lines of TKI therapy. The median number of prior TKI 
therapies was 1 (range 0 to 5) for the PDGFRA D842V mutant patients.

Outcomes and estimation 
4L + population 
The indication in 4L+ population was withdrawn by the applicant during the procedure. Therefore, this 
section is focused in the population of patients with a PDGFRA D842V mutation.  
PDGFRA D842V patients  
Efficacy data from 38 patients with unresectable or metastatic PDGFRA D842V-mutant GIST treated at 
300 mg/400 mg QD were updated serval times during the procedure. The most current results for ORR 
and OS, confirming the data below, were provided with a cut-off date of 17 April 2020 (data snapshot). 
Median follow-up time was 26 months. 
Primary endpoint:  
The ORR was 95% (n=38; 95% CI: 82.3, 99.4).  
Secondary endpoints: 
Median  PFS  and  duration  of  response  (DOR)  had  been  reached  at  the  time  of  the  17  January  2020 
snapshot and were 24 months (95% CI: 18.4, NE) and 22.1 months (95% CI: 14.1, NE), respectively.  
Exploratory endpoint (OS): 
Assessment report

Based on the most recent snapshot date, median OS has not been reached, but OS rate was estimated 
to be 88.6% (95% CI: 78.0, 99.1) at 18 months, and 70.6 % (95% CI: 55.2,86.0) at 24 and 36 months.

Assessment of PDGFRA D842V mutation status 
In  partnership  with  Blueprint,  QIAGEN  is  developing  an  in  vitro  diagnostic  (IVD)  device,  therascreen 
PDGFRα Polymerase Chain Reaction Kit, to detect the D842V single point mutation in the PDGFRα gene 
in DNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded GIST tumor tissue. Banked tumor samples from 
dose escalation and expansion patients were used to support development of this IVD. Patient samples 
were tested locally, and local results were used to assign patients to the appropriate expansion group. 
Samples  were  also  tested  retrospectively  at  a  central  laboratory,  MolecularMD,  as  part  of  the 
development of the QIAGEN assay, see BLU-285-1101 CSR. The development of the QIAGEN assay is 
ongoing and CE marking is planned for the EU. 
These patients can be identified by currently available laboratory tests as well as commercially available 
IVD’s. The applicant is partnering with QIAGEN to develop a CE marked IVD. In line with current practice 
in  the  EU  and  prescribing  information  precedents,  the  proposed  prescribing  information  indicates  the 
need to test for mutational status with a validated test without mentioning any specific tests as several 
suitable tests are commercially available in the EU.  
During  Part  1,  KIT  mutations  in  tumor  tissue  was  evaluated  using  KIT  Plasma-Seq  assay  (Sysmex, 
Hamburg,  Germany),  PDGFRA  mutations  were  evaluated  using  OncoBEAM™  PDGFRA  assay  (Sysmex, 
Hamburg, Germany). 
In Part 2, a next generation sequencing panel was used to detect KIT, PDGFRA, and other cancer relevant 
mutations.  Tumor tissue  for  both  KIT  and  PDGFRA  patients  was  evaluated using the  CancerSELECT™ 
125 assay PGDx, Baltimore, MD). 
Summary of main efficacy results 
The  following  table  summarises  the  efficacy  results  from  the  main  study  supporting  the  present 
application. This  summary should be read in conjunction with the discussion  on clinical  efficacy as 
well as the benefit risk assessment (see later sections).

Title: A Phase 1 Study of BLU-285 in Patients with Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumours (GIST) 
and other Relapsed and Refractory Solid Tumours. 
Study identifier 
BLU-285-1101 
EudraCT Number: 2015-001660-18 
Design 
Phase 1, open-label, first-in-human (FIH) dose-escalation study (Part 1) which 
was expanded to evaluate efficacy and safety of avapritinib in patients with 
unresectable GIST (Part 2). 
Hypothesis 
Duration of main phase:   
ongoing, patients may continue to receive 
avapritinib until precluded by toxicity, 
noncompliance, withdrawal of consent, 
physician decision, progressive disease, 
death, or closure of the study by the Sponsor  
Duration of Run-in phase: 
Duration of Extension phase: 
not applicable 
not applicable 
To evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, PD and preliminary antineoplastic 
activity of avapritinib, administered orally (PO), in adult patients with 
unresectable GIST (Part 1). 
The study was further expanded to include approximately 185 number of 
patients to evaluate efficacy and safety of 3 populations (Part 2).  
The final pivotal analyses were performed on two populations: the 4L+ and 
PDGFRA D842V GIST populations.

 The primary efficacy endpoint of ORR was 
defined as the proportion of patients with a 
confirmed best response of CR or PR, where 
CR or PR had to be confirmed at a subsequent 
assessment without intervening progression. 
The primary analysis of ORR was conducted 
by central radiology per mRECIST v1.1. 
Overall response rate was estimated using 
frequency, percentage, and 2-sided 95% CIs 
based on the exact binomial distribution 
(Clopper-Pearson) for the safety population. 
Duration of response was defined as the 
time from first documented response 
(CR/PR) to the date of first documented 
disease progression or death due to any 
cause, whichever occurred first. 
Disease control rate was defined as the 
proportion of patients with a confirmed 
CR,PR, or SD lasting for 4 cycles (16 weeks). 
The response was assessed per mRECIST 
v1.1 by central radiology and Investigator. 
Disease Control rate was estimated using 
frequency, 
percentage, and two-sided 95% CI based on 
the exact binomial distribution.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The proposed indication in this application are supported solely by the results of NAVIGATOR Study (BLU-
285-1101).  The  Applicant  has  provided  the  table  below,  showing  side-by-side  the  results  in  PDGRFA 
D842V patients from their study, the supportive study BLU-285-1002 and others from literature. Taking 
into account all the inherent limitations of indirect comparisons, the data presented is merely informative. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
N/A 
Supportive study(ies)  
Study (BLU-285-1002): A Retrospective Natural History Study of Patients with PDGFRA D842 
Mutant Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST) Previously Treated with a Kinase Inhibitor.  
Retrospective data were collected from 22 patients at 3 study centers. To prevent bias in the collection 
of information, case selection was based on a sequential, look-back approach. In particular, information 
regarding  any  treatment  outcomes  was  not  to  be  used  for  selection  purposes.  The  intention-to-treat 
(ITT)  and  FPT  populations  included  all  22  (100%)  patients  for  whom  data  were  collected.  The  SPT 
population, a subset of the ITT population, was comprised of 19 (86%) patients who received second-
line TKI treatment. The TPT population, also a subset of the ITT population, was comprised of 16 (73%) 
patients who received third-line TKI treatment. Of note, most patients (73%) included in this study were 
in the TPT population suggesting many GIST patients are not genotyped prior to treatment with approved 
inhibitors in the US (NCCN, 2018). 
The demography and baseline characteristics of patients enrolled were consistent with that expected for 
patients  with  unresectable  or  metastatic  GIST  and  the  main  study;  most  patients  with  data  available

were  male  (68%),  white  (95%),  and  not  Hispanic  or  Latino  (100%).  The  median  age  at  the  time  of 
diagnosis was 57 years and ages ranged from 31 years to 72 years.  
Per inclusion criteria, all patients included had a confirmed PDGFRA D842 mutation. The mutation in all 
patients was D842V. The primary tumor location in most patients (68%) was the stomach. Overall the 
patients studied had high disease burden with poor prognostic features. More than half of the patients 
(65%)  had  a  primary  tumor  size  >  10  cm;  96%  of  patients  had  prior  surgical  resection.  A  total  of  3 
(14%), 3 (14%), 5 (23%), and 11 (50%) patients received 1, 2, 3, or ≥ 4 lines of prior TKI therapy, 
respectively.  
The  efficacy  analysis  across  the  first-line  treatment,  second-line  treatment,  and  third-line  treatment 
populations was based principally on best overall response/ORR, DOR, and PFS with OS investigated as 
a secondary efficacy endpoint.  
The ORR, as calculated for all patients who received first-line treatment, was 4.5% (95% CI: 0.1, 22.8). 
No response was observed for the second-line or third-line treatment (ORR 0%). 
Overall, across all lines of treatment, including those beyond third-line that were not included in the FPT, 
SPT, and TPT population analyses, 2 patients had a CR or PR. One patient achieved CR for 11.9 months 
after  a  partial  omental  resection  and  first-line  treatment  with  imatinib.  The  other  patient  had  an 
unconfirmed  PR  for  less  than  a  month  (0.6  months)  in  duration  during  fourth-line  treatment  with 
crenolanib. 
The median PFS was 5.6  months (95% CI: 3.1, 16.2) after initiating first-line treatment, 2.6 months 
(95%  CI:  1.4,  5.9)  after  initiating  second-line  treatment,  and  5.6  months  (95%  CI:  2.1,  11.5)  after 
initiating third-line treatment. Figure 13 presents the Kaplan-Meier curve of PFS by line of prior therapy. 
The median OS was 44.5 months (95% CI: 20.4, 69.6) after initiating first-line treatment, 28.1 months 
(95% CI: 12.6, 56.7) after initiating second-line treatment, and 25.5 months (95% CI: 10.5, 55.0) after 
initiating third-line treatment.  
D180 Update 
The Applicant has provided an efficacy update from study BLU-285-1101 (the main clinical study included 
in the original submission), as well as topline results from the phase III, randomized, active controlled 
(vs. regorafenib) study BLU-285-1303, and preliminary results from study BLU-285-1105 (a phase I/II, 
open label, single arm study  in Chinese patients).  
Topline Results from Study BLU-285-1303 (VOYAGER) 
Study BLU-285-1303 (VOYAGER) is a global, open-label, randomized, Phase 3 trial designed to evaluate 
the  efficacy  and  safety  of  avapritinib  versus  regorafenib  in  patients  with  ≥3L  GIST.  Patients  were 
randomized 1:1 to receive either avapritinib (300 mg QD dosing) or regorafenib (160 mg QD dosing for 
3 out of every 4 weeks). The primary efficacy endpoint was PFS by blinded, independent central radiology 
review,  based  on  mRECIST  v1.1  criteria  for  GIST.  Patients  were  allowed  to  enroll  regardless  of  their 
PDGFRA-D842V mutation status, the mutation status being a pre-specified stratification factor. Overall, 
a total of 13 patients with a PDGFRA-D842V mutation were included, 7 in the avapritinib group and 6 in 
the regorafenib group. 
Based on the data from the 09 March 2020 DCO date, the study did not meet the primary endpoint in 
the ITT population (≥3L GIST patients). However, there was a statistically significant difference in PFS 
observed  in  the  subset  of  patients  with  PDGFRA  D842V  mutations  between  the  avapritinib  and 
regorafenib arms (see Table 5 and Figure 1). 
Assessment report  
EMA/451735/2020  
Page 100/144 
 
 
 
Among the patients with the D842V mutation, ORR (secondary endpoint) in the avapritinib group is 
42.9%, all of which were partial responses (i.e., 0% complete responses). None of the patients in the 
regorafenib group responded (0% ORR).  
Among avapritinib-treated patients, 1 patient had PD after ~10 months, but continued on avapritinib 
post-progression, 3 patients had PR and 3 patients had SD. Two of the 6 regorafenib-treated patients 
crossed-over to avapritinib after centrally confirmed PD as per protocol. One of them achieved a CR, 
whereas the other did not have a disease assessment before DCO.

• Study BLU-285-1105 
Study BLU-285-1105 is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1/2 study designed to evaluate the safety, 
PK and clinical efficacy of avapritinib in Chinese patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST. The 
study consists of a dose escalation part (Phase 1) and dose expansion (Phase 2) part. The Phase 1 
portion was a modified 3+3 dose escalation design with a starting dose of 200 mg QD, escalating to 
300 mg QD. The lower starting dose was used to assess for differences in tolerability in the Chinese 
population. As no dose limiting toxicities were observed, the Phase 2 portion of the study enrolled 
patients at the recommended Phase 2 (RP2D) dose of 300 mg QD. 
The Phase 2 portion of the study began enrolling in December 2019 and a cohort of 25 patients with 
PDGFRA D842V mutations regardless of previous lines of therapy is expected to be complete with data 
available in Q4 2022.  
Eight patients with unresectable or metastatic PDGFRA D842V-mutant GIST have been enrolled into 
the study (Phase 1 and Phase 2), all receiving a starting dose of 300 mg QD. At the time of the DCO 
date of 31 March 2020, 5 out of 8 patients had an objective response (62.5%), all of them as a PR. 
Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Dose-response 
No formal Phase II dose-ranging studies have been conducted. The dose finding was conducted with a 
3+3 dose escalation based on dose-limiting toxicities in the first treatment cycle (28 days). The 
optimal biologically active dose, i.e. the dose level where an increase in dose does not further improve 
effect outcomes, is not known. The MTD was initially set to 400 mg QD due to dose-limiting toxicities 
seen at 600 mg QD. However, after initiation of the study extension, the recommended starting dose 
was subsequently reduced to 300 mg QD. This reduction was not predefined in the study protocol. Of 
the patients with GIST harbouring the PDGFRA D842V mutation, 34 of 38 patients (90%) had a partial

or complete response even though 82% had dose interruptions and 63% had dose reductions due to 
adverse events. It was not investigated if lower initial doses can lead to similar efficacy with a lower 
risk of dose limiting adverse events.  
Avapritinib is given as a flat dose to all patients even though it has a high pharmacokinetic variability. 
The population pharmacokinetic model showed that the apparent oral clearance had inter-patient 
variability of 44%, and there is an eight to ten-fold difference in exposure (AUC0-T) at steady state 
between individual patients. There are known covariates affecting avapritinib exposure (PPI treatment, 
concomitant food intake, CYP3A inhibitors and -inducers) and several not yet investigated covariates 
that may affect the variability (e.g. CYP2C9 and CYP3A5-genotypes, UGT-genotypes and liver 
transporters). 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The  Applicant  initially  applied  for  a  Conditional  Marketing  Approval  (CMA)  based  on  a  single  “pivotal” 
study (study BLU-285-1101, NAVIGATOR) for the intended indication:  
“treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST who have been treated with 
at least 3 prior lines of therapy. 
And  
“treatment  of  adult  patients  with  unresectable  or  metastatic  gastrointestinal  stromal  tumours 
(GIST) harbouring the platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) D842V mutation, 
regardless of prior therapy.” 
During  the  procedure,  the  applicant  notified  the  withdrawal  of  the  4L  indication  from  this  MAA.  As  a 
result, the study population are 38 patients carrying the PDGFRA D842 mutation.  
The  NAVIGATOR  study  is  an  ongoing  Phase  1,  first-in-human,  dose-escalation,  expansion,  open-label 
study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, PD and efficacy of avapritinib in adults with unresectable 
GIST.  At  the  time  of  the  MAA  submission,  efficacy  data  have  been  provided  with  a  DCO  date  of  16 
November 2018. Additional follow-ups were provided during the procedure with a DCO date: 17 January 
2020 (+14 months), and data snapshot cut-off: 17 April 2020 (+4 months). 
The study design consisted of two parts: a dose escalation part (Part 1, completed), and a dose expansion 
part  (Part  2,  ongoing).  The  open-label,  uncontrolled  design  of  the  NAVIGATOR  study,  along  with  the 
reduced sample size, pose relevant limitations to the interpretation of the results. 
Following the results from Part 1, the initial study design was modified to increase the sample size in 
part 2 and to add the central assessment of ORR (by mRECIST v1.1) as a primary objective of Part 2. 
As a result, there are 3 expansion groups in cohort 3: the original expansion groups 1 (+3L non PDGFRA 
D842V  patients)  and  2  (PDGFRA  D842V  patients,  regardless  of  prior  therapy)  and  a  new  group, 
expansion group 3 (+2L non PDGFRA D842V patients).   
Assessment report  
EMA/451735/2020  
Page 103/144 
 
 
 
The population included in the study is composed mainly by two different patient subsets:  
- GIST patients who had received 3L+ of prior therapies (4L+ GIST population, n=121); 
- GIST patients carrying the PDGFRA D842V mutation, regardless of number of prior therapies 
(n=38).  
Five extra patients had PDGFRA exon 18 mutations different from D842V.  
Efficacy results have been presented for the 300mg and 400mg doses separately and by pooling both 
together. This approach is considered acceptable. 
Key  eligibility  criteria  for  part  2  included  age  ≥  18  years,  unresectable  GIST,  progressing  following 
imatinib and at least 1 subsequent treatment, ECOG 0-2. Patients with D842 mutation in PDGFRA were 
allowed to enrol regardless of prior therapy. Patients with known brain metastasis, and relevant CNS, 
cardiovascular disorders or other relevant comorbidity were excluded.  
The primary efficacy endpoint was ORR (CR+PR), by central radiology per mRECIST v1.1. Key secondary 
efficacy endpoints were DOR, PFS, and CBR, as per mRECIST v1.1; OS was included as an exploratory 
efficacy endpoint.  
Overall, the selection of primary endpoint is in line with phase 1 development. In the context of a CMA 
in a setting where there are no alternative treatments with proven clinical benefit, this endpoint selection 
could be considered acceptable.  
Regarding the patients carrying the PDGFRA D842V mutation (n=38), their demographics and disease 
characteristics were similar to those of the overall 4L+ population in terms of age, race, gender, ECOG 
performance status, and presence of metastatic disease at the time of study entry. The median number 
of  treatment  lines  received,  was  1  (range  0-5),  with  only  15.8%  of  patients  having  been  exposed  to 
regorafenib in the subgroup of patients with the PDGFRA D842V mutation. Five patients were TKi-naïve.  
An  additional  phase  III  study  (BLU-285-1303)  is  currently  ongoing.  This  is  a  global,  open-label, 
randomized  (1:1),  Phase  3  trial  designed  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  avapritinib  versus 
regorafenib in patients with ≥3L disease. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either avapritinib (300 
mg QD dosing) or regorafenib (160 mg QD dosing for 3 out of every 4 weeks). Patients are allowed to 
enroll  regardless  of  their  PDGFRA-D842V  mutation  status,  although  the  mutation  status  was  a  pre-
specified stratification factor. The primary efficacy endpoint was PFS as assessed by blinded, independent 
central radiology review, based on mRECIST v1.1 criteria for GIST. Per the design of the trial, patients 
with PDGFRA D842V-mutant GIST were eligible, but given the rarity of this mutation, only 13 patients

Page 104/144 
 
 
 
 
 
(~3%) were randomized. The PDGFRA D842V mutation status was a stratification factor, thus patients 
were evenly distributed between the 2 treatment arms. 
This study did not meet the primary endpoint of an improvement in PFS for avapritinib versus regorafenib 
in the general patient population (ITT) with third- or fourth-line GIST. Available PFS results in the subset 
of patients with the PDGFRA D842V mutation, although immature, are presented as supportive to the 
benefit-risk balance in the target patient population with PDGFRA D842V mutated GIST. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Results in the population of patients with the PDGFRA D842V mutation  
BLU-285-1101 (NAVIGATOR) study 
At the time of the most recent DCO available (data snapshot: 17 April 2020), median follow up time was 
26 months. The results show an outstanding efficacy with an ORR of 95% (95% CI: 82.3, 99.4), a DOR 
of  22.1  months  (95%  CI:  14.1,  NE)  and  a  median  PFS  of  24  months  (95%  CI:  18.4,  NE),  while  the 
median OS has not been reached yet (36-months OS rate is 70.6% [95% CI: 55.2, 86.0]). 
ORR  results  in  the  patients  with  the  PDGFRA  D842V  mutation,  are  outstanding  in  this  patient 
population.  Data  on  patients  naïve  to  TKIs  appear  consistent  with  that  of  the  overall  D842V-mutant 
group, but is even more limited (n=5). However, it is agreed that in the D842V mutant GIST patient 
population, ORR results are unprecedented and results would not be expected to be of a lesser magnitude 
in the 1L setting, and the benefit is considered to be demonstrated regardless of the line of treatment. 
In addition, the reported durable responses compare favourably with that reported from the literature 
for other TKIs in the target population. Overall, the reported results in the population with the PDGFRA 
D842V mutation are considered relevant in the context of a patient population with limited treatment 
options and poor responses to approved TKI agents. This benefit is considered clinically meaningful. 
BLU-285-1303 (VOYAGER) study 
The topline results in the subset of patients with PDGFRA D842V mutations (DCO date: 09 March 2020) 
show an ORR (secondary endpoint) in the avapritinib group of 42.9% (all partial responses), while none 
of the patients in the regorafenib group responded (0% ORR). The magnitude of these results is smaller 
than those reported in study BLU-285-1101 (NAVIGATOR), and the reason behind it remains unclear. 
Several factors could have played a role in the differences observed, such as the small sample size and 
different therapy settings in terms of prior TKI treatments across all studies, since most patients from 
BLU-285-1101 were either TKI naïve or had received 1 prior TKI (13.2% and 47.4%, respectively), while 
patients in study BLU-285-1303 are at a later stage of the disease (≥3L).  
Regarding  median  PFS  in  the  patients  with  the  PDGFRA  D842V  mutation  ,  there  was  a  statistically 
significant difference, with a not estimable median PFS in the subset of patients with PDGFRA D842V 
mutations who were randomized to avapritinib (95% CI: 9.7, NE) compared to 4.5 months in patients 
receiving regorafenib (95% CI: 1.7, NE). 
Results from study BLU-285-1105, although limited (n=8), are considered supportive of the benefit-risk 
of avapritinib in the target patient population: 5 patients achieved a PR (62.5% ORR) and 3 had a SD. 
All of the mutant GIST patients in this study received a starting dose of 300 mg avapritinib QD. 
Overall, the reported results in the patients with the PDGFRA D842V mutation are considered relevant 
in the context of a patient population with limited treatment options and poor responses to approved 
TKI agents.

Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA  
In order to provide comprehensive efficacy and safety data and being able to address remaining 
uncertainties needed to support the switching from conditional to normal marketing authorisation, the 
following SOBs are proposed:  
• Study BLU-285-1101: Final CSR by 2H 2021 
• Study BLU-285-1303: Final CSR by 1H 2021 
Final CSRs from the ongoing studies BLU-285-1101 and BLU-285-1303 will include all available data on 
the safety and efficacy of avapritinib in patients with PDGFRA D842V-mutant GIST (n=51). Study 
results in the 2L+ GIST patients demonstrate an equivalent median duration of exposure to avapritinib 
as those in the 1L setting (23.2 months in both populations), indicating that safety and efficacy are 
similar despite prior line of treatment, and are therefore considered relevant when assessing 
avapritinib in the 1L disease setting. 
• Study BLU-285-1406: this is a newly proposed observational study to assess long-term safety and 
efficacy in treatment naïve patients with unresectable or metastatic PDGFRA D842V-mutant GIST. Final 
study report to be provided by December 2027. Draft protocol: to be submitted at the latest 2 months 
after EC Decision. Enrollment update to be provided within each PSUR cycle. Annual interim reports will 
be provided within the annual renewal as of the second annual renewal.  
This proposed study will be set up to collect long-term (minimum 2 years) safety and efficacy data in 
approximately 50 GIST patients in the 1L disease setting harbouring the PDGFRA D842V mutation.  
Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Avapritinib  has  shown  an  outstanding  and  durable  ORR  in  patients  expressing  the  PDGFRA  D842V 
mutation  regardless  of  prior  line  of  therapy,  which  is  unprecedented  in  a  population  subset  that 
traditionally is unresponsive to TKI therapy. Even acknowledging the limitations associated to the low 
number of patients treated, the clinical benefit of this treatment in the intended target population has 
been shown.

The  primary  evidence  of  safety  for  the  registration of  avapritinib  is  Study  BLU-285-1101,  an  ongoing 
Phase  1,  open-label  study  designed  to  evaluate  the  safety,  tolerability,  pharmacokinetics  (PK), 
pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of avapritinib administered orally (PO), which enrolled a total of 237

patients  with  unresectable  or  metastatic  GIST.  Additional  safety  data  for  avapritinib  from  an  ongoing 
Phase 3 study in patients with advanced GIST (Study BLU-285-1303) and an ongoing Phase 1 study in 
patients with AdvSM (Study BLU-285-2101) are provided. Safety data from these 3 studies were pooled 
for  analysis.  Data  are  presented  as  of  16  November  2018,  the  data  cutoff  date  for  this  marketing 
application. An updated safety database with a cut-off date 9th March 2020 has been submitted during 
the procedure and is presented at the end of this section. 
The Safety Population includes all patients who received at least 1 dose of avapritinib. All analyses are 
based on the Safety Population, and/or its subgroups, unless otherwise specified. Discussion of results

focuses  on  patients  with  GIST  whose  starting  dose  of  avapritinib  was  300/400  mg,  unless  otherwise 
specified. 
A  total  of  335  patients  with  GIST  or  AdvSM  across  all  doses  were  included  in  the  Safety  Population. 
Among the patients with GIST, 234 patients received a starting dose of 300/400 mg avapritinib.  
Studies BLU-285-1101 and BLU-285-1303 contributed 237 and 30 patients with GIST, respectively, and 
Study  BLU-285-2101  contributed  68  patients  with  AdvSM  to  the  Safety  Population.  Studies  BLU-285-
1101 and BLU-285-2101 contributed 44 and 31 patients, respectively, to the DD Population. 
As of the data cutoff date, 83 (35.5%) of these patients continued to receive avapritinib.  
A  total  of  151  (64.5%)  of  the  234  patients  had  discontinued  treatment.  The  primary  reason  for 
discontinuation of treatment was disease progression (41.9%), followed by AE (15.4%). As of the data 
cutoff date, 94/234 GIST patients exposed to 300/400mg (40.2%) had discontinued from the study. The 
primary reason for study discontinuation was death (30.8%), followed by withdrawal by subject (6.0%).  
The  majority  of  patients  with  GIST  (234/  267,  87.6%)  received  a  starting  dose  of  300/400  mg  of 
avapritinib.  The  median  duration  of  treatment  for  these  patients  was  17.5  weeks  (range:  0.1,  107.1 
weeks), with 61/234 (26.1%) and 33/234 (14.1%) having been exposed to avapritinib for >24 to ≤48 
weeks and >48 weeks, respectively. The median relative dose intensity was 90%, indicating good overall 
compliance with dosing.  
For patients whose starting dose was 400 mg, the median relative dose intensity was 73% compared 
with 94% for patients whose starting dose was 300 mg.  
A majority of patients (63.7%) had at least 1 dose interruption or missed dose due to an AE, and nearly 
half (47.0%) had at least 1 dose reduction due to an AE. 
Demographics  and  disease  baseline  characteristics  have  been  extensively  presented  in  the  Efficacy 
Section. From the safety point of view, it is relevant to note that up to 107 (40.1%) of patients with 
GIST were older than 65 years old, and that 96 (36.0%) of patients with GIST had received 4 or more 
prior lines of TKIs. Among the patients with GIST whose starting dose was 300/400 mg, 96.2% had at 
least 1 ongoing medical condition at baseline (GI disorders (66.7%) and Vascular Disorders (55.1%), 
the  most  frequent),  and  98.7%  took  at  least  1  concomitant  medication,  including  paracetamol, 
furosemide, ondansetron red blood cells, etc.

 The safety database includes a total of 585 patients with GIST (all doses), of which 550 patients received 
avapritinib at a starting dose of 300 mg or 400 mg. This includes 250 patients in study BLU-285-1101, 
239  patients  in  study  BLU-285-1303  who  received  treatment  with  avapritinib,  and  96  patients  who 
received regorafenib in study BLU-285-1303 and then crossed over to receive avapritinib treatment due 
to disease progression on the regorafenib control treatment.  
The most frequently reported adverse reactions of any Grade during treatment with Ayvakyt were nausea 
(45%), 
fatigue  (40%),  anaemia  (39%),  periorbital  oedema  (33%), 
face  oedema  (27%), 
hyperbilirubinaemia (28%), diarrhoea (26%), vomiting (24%), oedema peripheral (23%), lacrimation 
increased (22%), decreased appetite (21%) and memory impairment (20%).  
Serious adverse reactions occurred in 23% of patients receiving avapritinib. The most common serious 
adverse reactions during treatment with avapritinib were anaemia (6%), and pleural effusion (1%).  
The  most  common  adverse  reactions  leading  to  permanent  treatment  discontinuation  were  fatigue, 
encephalopathy  and  intracranial  haemorrhage  (<  1%  each).  Adverse  reactions  leading  to  a  dose 
reduction  included  anaemia,  fatigue,  neutrophil  count  decreased,  blood  bilirubin  increased,  memory 
impairment, cognitive disorder, periorbital oedema, nausea and face oedema.

Serious adverse events and deaths 
•  Deaths 
Table 12 provides a summary of AEs leading to death for all patients in the Safety Population.  
--Patients with GIST  
Of the 27 patients who experienced on-treatment death, over half (15 of 27) of the deaths occurred at 
least 7 days after the last dose of avapritinib (range: 7, 30 days). For the majority of patients (20 of 
27), the cause of these on-treatment deaths was assessed by the Investigator as progressive disease.  
•  Other serious adverse events 
Assessment report  
EMA/451735/2020  
Page 113/144 
 
 
 
 
 
--Patients with GIST  
A  total  of  20.1%  of  patients  experienced  SAEs  that  were  considered  treatment-related.  Treatment-
related SAEs experienced by ≥1% of patients were anaemia (4.3%), pleural effusion (1.7%), and acute 
kidney  injury  (1.3%).  The  incidence  of  these  most  commonly  reported  treatment-related  SAEs  was 
generally similar between patients whose starting dose was 300 mg and those whose starting dose was 
400 mg with the exception of anaemia, although the difference was small (5.4% vs 0%). Most of these 
commonly reported SAEs and treatment-related SAEs are consistent with inhibition of KIT and PDGFRA, 
oral kinase inhibitors in general, and the underlying disease.  
•  Other significant adverse events: Adverse Events Leading to Study Drug Discontinuation  
A  total  of  19.7%  of  patients  with  GIST  discontinued  study  drug  due  to  an  AE,  which  appeared  to  be 
predominantly  related  to  the  patients’  underlying  disease.  The  most  commonly  (≥1%)  reported  AEs 
leading to study drug discontinuation by PT were disease progression (3.0%), general physical health 
deterioration (1.7%), and abdominal pain, acute kidney injury, anaemia, fatigue, and sepsis (1.3%).  
For these patients, 9.0% discontinued study drug due to an AE that was considered treatment-related. 
The following treatment-related AEs led to study drug discontinuation in >1 patient: fatigue (1.7%) and 
confusional state, encephalopathy, nausea, and vomiting (<1% each)  
•  Other significant adverse events: Adverse Events Leading to Dose Modification  
A total of 65.0% of patients experienced AEs leading to dose interruption. The most commonly (≥5%) 
reported AEs leading to dose interruption by PT were anaemia (10.3%), fatigue (9.8%), nausea (7.7%), 
vomiting (5.6%), and blood bilirubin increased (5.1%).  
Assessment report  
EMA/451735/2020  
Page 114/144 
 
 
 
 
 
The incidence of AEs leading to dose interruption was similar for patients whose starting dose was 300 
mg compared with those whose starting dose was 400 mg except for the PT of fatigue (7.1% vs 20.0%).  
A  total  of  46.2%  of  patients  experienced  AEs  leading  to  dose  reduction.  The  most  commonly  (≥5%) 
reported AEs leading to dose reduction by PT were fatigue (9.8%) and anaemia (5.6%).  
The incidence of AEs leading to dose reduction was lower for patients whose starting dose was 300 mg 
(40.8%) than for those whose starting dose was 400 mg (66.0%). For most AEs leading to dose reduction 
by  PT,  the  incidence  was  similar  between  the  2  dose  groups  with  the  exception  of  fatigue  (5.4%  vs 
26.0%).  
•  Adverse Events of Special Interest  
The  AESIs  identified  for  the  avapritinib  clinical  development  program  include  cognitive  effects  and 
intracranial bleeding. The  PTs  for the AESI of cognitive effects include memory impairment, cognitive 
disorder, confusional state, and encephalopathy. The PTs for the AESI of intracranial bleeding include 
haemorrhage intracranial, cerebral haemorrhage, and subdural haematoma.

Cognitive disorders 
Overall, 36% of patients who received treatment with avapritinib experienced cognitive effects, including 
38%  of  patients  with  GIST  and  31%  of  patients  with  AdvSM.  The  majority  of  the  events  in  both 
indications were nonserious. Most patients (25% of patients with GIST and 19% of patients with AdvSM) 
experienced Grade 1 (mild) cognitive effects, which according to the CTCAE definition did not interfere 
with ADLs. Approximately 13% of patients with GIST and 12% of patients with AdvSM experienced Grade 
2  or  Grade  3  cognitive  effects,  which  according  to  the  CTCAE  definition  had  clinical  relevance  (eg, 
interfered with ADLs or self-care). No patients reported Grade 4 or Grade 5 cognitive effects. The most 
frequently reported cognitive effect was memory impairment reported in 20% of patients with GIST and 
19% of patients with AdvSM. The other cognitive effect terms were reported at a lower incidence and 
included cognitive disorder (12% and 10% in patients with GIST and AdvSM, respectively), confusional 
state (5% and 7% in patients with GIST and AdvSM, respectively) and encephalopathy (<1% and 3% 
in patients with GIST and AdvSM, respectively). 
Overall, 3% of patients reported serious events of cognitive effects, including 3% of patients with GIST 
and 4% of patients with AdvSM. The majority of the serious cognitive effects in both indications were 
Grade 3 (73%) and assessed as related to study drug (82%). Slightly less than half of the serious events 
resolved or resolved with sequelae.  
Confounders were present in 10 of the 11 patients who experienced serious events and included a history 
of psychiatric conditions or insomnia, psychiatric or opioid concomitant medication use, polypharmacy, 
poor sleep hygiene, concurrent illness/infection/dehydration, and cognitive symptoms occurring in the 
setting of disease progression leading to imminent death. 
The majority of patients with cognitive effects continued dosing with avapritinib with only 2% of patients 
overall experiencing cognitive effects leading to permanent discontinuation of study treatment (2% and 
3% of patients with GIST and AdvSM, respectively). This observation implies that the cognitive effects 
appeared to be tolerated by the physicians and patients as the benefit/risk profile of continued treatment 
with avapritinib was positive. 
Additional variables identified that may have a potential impact on cognitive effects included age (≥65 
years)  and  medical  history  of  cognitive  effects.  Thirty-five  percent  of  patients  with  GIST  and  53%  of 
patients  with  AdvSM  had  a  medical  history  of  events  within  the  SOC  of  Psychiatric  Disorders  (eg, 
Assessment report  
EMA/451735/2020

insomnia, anxiety, and depression). Patients in North America also had a higher incidence of cognitive 
effects  compared  with  patients  in  Europe  or  RoW;  however,  this  observation  may  be  influenced  by 
reporting bias. Logistic regression modeling showed a significant effect for maximum dose of avapritinib 
on the odds ratio of cognitive effects of Grade ≥2: the odds of patients with a maximum dose of ≤300 
mg experiencing a Grade ≥2 cognitive effect were reduced by a multiplier of 33% compared with patients 
with a maximum dose of >300 mg. 
An analysis of time to onset and improvement of cognitive effects in patients with GIST was performed. 
Of the 234 patients with GIST whose starting dose was 300/400 mg, 89 patients experienced cognitive 
effects of any grade. In the patients who had an event, the median time to onset was 9 weeks. Kaplan-
Meier analyses of time to onset of these events demonstrated that if patients have not experienced a 
cognitive effect over the initial 7 to 8 months of treatment, they are unlikely to experience an event. Of 
the  234  patients  with  GIST  whose  starting  dose  was  300/400  mg,  29  patients  experienced  Grade ≥2 
cognitive effects. The median time to improvement to Grade ≤1 for these patients was 13 weeks. Because 
cognitive  effects  of  Grade  ≤1  do  not  affect  ADLs  or  self-care,  improvement  to  Grade  ≤1  is  clinically 
important to patients. Additional data on long-term outcome and additional risk factors are needed to 
further understand the long-term impact of cognitive effects associated with avapritinib. 
Nonclinical mechanistic studies could not clearly identify the underlying mechanism for cognitive effects 
(ie, memory impairment). Review of brain imaging results during the clinical studies did not reveal any 
anatomical changes associated with cognitive effect symptoms. 
The Applicant proposes that patients should be informed about potential cognitive effects, and the dose 
of  avapritinib  should  be  interrupted  and  reduced  according  to  the  severity  of  the  events.  The  SmPC 
includes  dose-adjustment  recommendations  (Section  4.2.)  and  a  precautionary  statement  in  Section 
4.4. to manage this AE. 
Intracranial Bleeding 
Overall, 3.0% of the 335 patients who received treatment with avapritinib for the indications of GIST 
and  AdvSM  experienced  events  of  intracranial  bleeding  (Table  19).  Three  patients  with  GIST  (1.1%) 
experienced  subdural  haematoma,  haemorrhage  intracranial,  and  cerebral  haemorrhage  (1  patient 
each),  and  10.3%  of  patients  with  AdvSM  (7  patients)  experienced  subdural  haematoma  (5.9%)  and 
haemorrhage intracranial (4.4%). 
Six patients (1.8%) reported serious events of intracranial bleeding (2 patients with GIST and 4 patients 
with  AdvSM),  and  3  patients  (<1%)  experienced  intracranial  bleeding  events  leading  to  permanent 
discontinuation  of  study  treatment  (2  patients  with  GIST  and  1  patient  with  AdvSM)  (Table  20).  In 
addition to the serious AESIs of intracranial bleeding discussed in this section, 2 additional events were 
reported after the data cutoff date of 16 November 2018;  
Thus, in the avapritinib clinical trials, so far 12 events of intracranial bleeding have been reported, 5 in 
the  GIST  population  and 7  in  the  Advanced  Systemic  Mastocytosis  (AdvSM)  population  of  which  nine 
were considered related to treatment with avapritinib.  
Serious  adverse  reactions  of  intracranial  haemorrhage  were  reported in  patients  with  unresectable  or 
metastatic  GIST  receiving  avapritinib.  The  exact  mechanism  is  unknown.  However,  some  risk  factors 
were identified. Therefore, a precautionary statement has been included in the SmPC in order to minimise 
the  risk,  which  recommends  particular  caution  in  patients  with  risk  factors  such  as  severe 
thrombocytopenia, and in patients with increased risk of intracranial haemorrhage such as those with a 
vascular  aneurysm  or  a  history  of  intracranial  haemorrhage  within  the  prior  year,  a  history  of  a 
cerebrovascular accident or transient ischaemic attack. In addition, a recommendation to seek medical 
advice  to  patients  who  experience  clinically  relevant  neurological  signs  and  symptoms  (e.g.  severe 
headache, vision problems, somnolence, or focal weakness) during treatment with Ayvakyt, to perform

brain MRI or CT at the discretion of the physician based on severity and the clinical presentation, and to 
permanently  discontinue  treatment  for  patients  with  observed  intracranial  haemorrhage  during 
treatment with avapritinib, regardless of Grade are now included (Section 4.4, 4.2, and 4.8). 
In  addition,  appropriate  information  is  now  included  in  the  SmPC  concerning  other  relevant  risks 
identified or potential for avapritinib treatment, including the risk for hemarraghic events other than IC 
bleedings,  cognitive  events,  fluid  retention  (e.g.  including  facial,  peripheral,  and  pleural  effusion),  GI 
disorders,  photosensitivity  reactions,  the  risk  for  prolonging  QT  effects,  as  well  as  relevant  DDI  with 
CYP3A  inhibitors  /inducers,  and  liver  enzyme  and  bilirubin  elevations,  which  require  particular 
monitoring.   
• 
Late-breaking safety data 
Between  database  cutoff  (16  November  2018)  and  the  late-breaking  data  cutoff  (28  February  2019) 
deaths and treatment-related SAEs were reported for patients participating in ongoing studies (BLU-285-
1101, BLU-285-1303, and BLU-285-2101). A total of 4 deaths (6 fatal events) and 31 treatment-related 
SAEs (in 18 patients) have been reported. One of these deaths was considered to be related to avapritinib 
treatment. There were 4 serious AESIs reported during the late-breaking period, 2 intracranial bleedings 
and 2 cognitive effects, all of which occurred in patients with GIST, and related to avapritinib (discussed 
above). 
•  Analysis of Adverse Events by Organ System or Syndrome 
An analysis of AEs was performed for those SOCs that included any PT (all grades) experienced by ≥
10% of all patients in the Safety Population (Table 27). The results of this analysis are presented in the 
subsections that follow in order of descending frequency. 
Assessment report  
EMA/451735/2020  
Page 118/144 
 
 
 
 
 
By Organ System or Syndrome, GI disorders SOC were the most commonly reported AEs (89.1%), 
among all GIST patients, followed by general disorders and administration site conditions (82.2%), and 
nervous system disorders (65.9%).  
The most common treatment-related GI AEs (≥10%) among patients with GIST 300/400mg were nausea 
(57.3%), vomiting (29.9%), and diarrhoea (28.6%). The majority of GI disorders were Grade 1 or 2 in 
severity; Grade ≥3 GI AEs were reported in 22.6% of patients. Serious AEs were experienced by 14.5% 
of patients, including GI haemorrhages. Most AEs in this SOC did not result in dose modification. Of the 
234  patients,  8.5%  had  a  dose  reduction  (primarily  due  to  AEs  of  nausea)  and  22.6%  had  dose 
interruptions.  
Among the 234 patients with GIST whose starting dose was 300/400 mg, 82.1% had at least 1 AE within 
the General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions SOC.  The most common AEs (≥10%) within 
this  SOC  were  fatigue  (53.0%),  oedema  peripheral  (27.8%),  face  oedema  (24.4%),  and  pyrexia 
(12.8%).  The  majority  of  general  disorders  AEs  were  Grade  1  or  2  in  severity;  Grade  ≥3  AEs  were 
Assessment report  
EMA/451735/2020  
Page 119/144 
 
 
 
 
 
reported  in  17.5%  of  patients,  primarily  reports  of  fatigue  (6.8%),  disease  progression  (5.1%),  and 
general physical health deterioration (2.6%). Serious AEs were experienced by 10.7% of patients.  
Treatment-related  respiratory  AEs  were  reported  in  19.2%  of  patients;  the  majority  of  respiratory 
disorders  were  Grade  1  or  2  in  severity;  Grade  ≥3  AEs  were  reported  in  6.8%  of  patients,  primarily 
reports of dyspnoea (2.6%) and pleural effusion (2.1%). Pleural effusion is an expected toxicity that is 
likely related to inhibition of wild-type KIT/PDGFRA in patients with advanced GIST.  
Laboratory findings 
•  Serum Chemistry 
Shifts in selected serum chemistry parameters from Grade ≤2 at baseline to Grade ≥3 at the worst value 
on treatment are summarized in Table 28 for patients with GIST whose starting dose was 300/400 mg, 
patients with AdvSM, and the overall population. 
Assessment report  
EMA/451735/2020  
Page 120/144 
 
 
 
 
 
In patients with GIST, there were no shifts in laboratory values from any grade at baseline to Grade 4 
for any of these selected serum chemistry parameters except for decreased potassium. Mean values of 
ALT initially decreased from baseline at Week 1, increased from baseline from Weeks 2 through 12, and 
then generally stabilized near or below baseline thereafter. Mean values of AST increased slightly from 
baseline  at  Week  1,  increased  more  notably  at  Weeks  2  through  8,  and,  remained  above  baseline 
thereafter,  although  generally  lower  than  Weeks  2  through  8.  Mean  values  of  total  bilirubin  initially 
showed a small decrease at Week 1, increased notably at Weeks 2 through 12, and generally decreased 
and  remained  below  20  μmol/L  after  Week  24.  Increased  bilirubin  was  generally  not  associated  with 
transaminase or alkaline phosphatase elevation, and there were no cases that met Hy’s law criteria. The 
increases  in  total  bilirubin  were  consistent  with  avapritinib’s  known  inhibition  of  hepatic  BSEP.  Mean 
values of potassium increased very slightly at Week 1 and then decreased at Week 2 and remained below 
baseline, although never less than 3.5 mmol/L, thereafter. The decreases in potassium levels may be 
related to diarrhea and vomiting, which are commonly reported for patients with GIST.  
•  Hematology 
Shift analyses from baseline to worst value on treatment based on the NCI CTCAE were conducted for 
hematology parameters; Shifts in selected hematology parameters from Grade ≤2 at baseline to Grade 
≥3 at the worst value on treatment are summarized in Table 30 for patients with GIST whose starting 
dose was 300/400 mg, patients with AdvSM, and the overall population. 
--Patients with GIST 
As shown in Table 30, 24.4% of patients had decreased hemoglobin values that shifted from Grade ≤2 
at  baseline to  Grade ≥3  on  study.  For  decreased neutrophil  and  leukocyte  counts,  5.6%  and  4.3%  of 
Assessment report  
EMA/451735/2020  
Page 121/144 
 
 
 
 
 
patients, respectively, had values that shifted from Grade ≤2 at baseline to Grade ≥3 on study. Only 1 
patient had decreased platelet counts that shifted from Grade ≤2 at baseline to Grade ≥3 on study. There 
were  no  shifts  in  laboratory  values  from  any  grade  at  baseline  to  Grade  4  for  any  of  these  selected 
hematology  parameters  except  for  decreased  neutrophil  count.  One patient  had  decreased neutrophil 
counts that shifted from Grade 2 at baseline to Grade 4 as the worst value on study. 
Consistent  with  the  known  effects  of  KIT  inhibition  on  hematopoiesis,  avapritinib  treatment  led  to 
decreases in hemoglobin, neutrophil count (and subsequently leukocyte count), and platelet count. Mean 
hemoglobin values decreased from Weeks 2 through 16 and generally stabilized after Week 20. Mean 
neutrophil counts decreased notably at Week 2, continued to decrease slightly through Week 12, and 
generally stabilized after Week 16. Mean leukocyte counts followed a pattern similar to neutrophil counts. 
Mean platelet counts increased markedly at Week 1, decreased to near baseline and then below baseline 
at Weeks 2 through Week 12 and generally stabilized after Week 16. 
•  Vital signs and physical findings, and other observations related to safety 
There were no relevant changes in mean systolic blood pressure and mean diastolic blood pressure from 
baseline at week 52.  
--CV findings 
Cardiovascular and vital sign assessments of avapritinib have been conducted in a hERG assay in vitro 
and, subsequently, in vivo in dogs implanted with radiotelemetry and administered single PO doses of 
avapritinib  in  a  Good  Laboratory  Practice-compliant  cardiopulmonary  safety  pharmacology  study  and 
ECG assessments in the 28-day and 3-month oral toxicity studies in dogs. There were no observations 
of QT prolongation or other negative cardiovascular signals.  
In addition, an analysis of continuous ECG (Holter) data from the expansion part (Part 2) of Study BLU-
285-1101 was performed to satisfy the requirement for a definitive QT assessment of avapritinib: 
A total of 27 patients at selected sites participated in continuous ECG (Holter) monitoring in Study BLU-
285-1101.  Avapritinib  had  a  small  effect  on  the  QTc  at  steady-state  plasma  concentrations,  after  QD 
administration of 300 or 400 mg:  
On C1D15 (steady state), the mean ΔQTcF was 7.0 msec (90% CI: 2.84, 11.14) at the time point before 
dosing, and above 5 msec at all time points after dosing, except at 4 hours after dosing (4.6 msec; 90% 
CI: 0.50, 8.65). The largest mean ΔQTcF was observed at 1 hour and 8 hours after dosing: 9.9 and 9.5 
msec, respectively (90% CIs: 5.72, 14.03 and 5.30, 13.62, respectively). Three patients had a ΔQTcF 
>30 msec, and no patients had a ΔQTcF >60 msec. No patients had a QTcF >450 msec.  
In the concentration-QTc analysis of data, a linear model was used to establish the relationship between 
plasma concentrations of avapritinib and ΔQTcF. The predicted ΔQTcF effect using this model was 6.55 
msec (90% CI: 1.80 to 11.29) at the steady-state geometric mean maximum observed concentration of 
avapritinib (899 ng/mL) for the pooled 300/400 mg doses. A QT effect (ΔQTcF) exceeding 20 msec can 
be excluded at avapritinib plasma concentrations up to 1645 ng/mL. No effect on heart rate or cardiac 
conduction (PR, RR, and QRS intervals) was observed.  
In addition, 3.9% of patients overall reported events within the SMQ Torsade de pointes/QT prolongation 
(3.0% and 7.4% of patients with GIST and AdvSM, respectively), including events of electrocardiogram 
QT prolonged, ventricular arrhythmia, and syncope. The majority of events were nonserious, Grade 1 or 
2, resolved, and assessed as not related to study drug. Events of pericardial effusion were reported for 
2 patients with GIST. For Patient BLU-285-1101-05-2001-005, a patient with GIST whose starting dose 
was <300 mg, the event of pericardial effusion was Grade 4, serious, and considered to be related to 
avapritinib; the event led to study drug interruption.

Safety in special populations 
In NAVIGATOR and VOYAGER (N=550), 39% of patients were 65 years of age and older, and 9% were 
75  years  of  age  and  older.  Compared  with  younger  patients  (<65),  more  patients ≥65  years  old  had 
reported adverse reactions that led to dose reductions (55% versus 45%) and dose discontinuation (18% 
versus  4%).  The  types  of  adverse  reactions  reported  were  similar  regardless  of  age.  Older  patients 
reported more Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions compared to younger patients (63% versus 50%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/451735/2020  
Page 123/144 
 
 
 
 
 
In general, the types of AEs reported was similar between patients ≥65 years in all age categories and 
patients <65 years with the exception of events within the Cardiac disorders SOC which had a higher 
incidence in patients ≥65 years (6% vs 11%, 19%, 33%) and increased with increasing age. The SmPC 
includes relevant available information on the elderly population. 
In general, no relevant differences, or a clear trend in a particular direction, were observed in the AE 
profiles by gender, race, region, prior lines of TKIs, prior distinct TKIs, total duration of prior TKIs. With 
caution, given the limitations of the safety database, it is noted that patients who had received 4+ prior 
distinct TKIs (49.1%) were more likely to experience AESIs of cognitive effects than were patients who 
had received 2 (36.0%), 3 (33.8%), or 1 TKI(s) (30.2%); Similarly, patients who had received 3 or 4+ 
prior  lines  of  TKI  therapy  were  more  likely  to  experience  treatment-related  Grade  ≥3  AEs  and  SAEs, 
predominantly events of anaemia.

Drugs That May Increase Avapritinib Plasma Concentrations 
CYP3A Inhibitors 
In  vitro  studies  demonstrated  that  avapritinib  Phase  I  metabolism  is  predominantly  mediated  by 
cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, and to a minor extent by CYP2C9. 
In a crossover clinical DDI study in healthy subjects (N=20), coadministration of itraconazole (200 mg 
twice daily on Day 1 followed by 200 mg QD for 13 days) with a single 200 mg dose of avapritinib on 
Day 4 increased avapritinib Cmax by 1.4-fold and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) 
by 4.2-fold, relative to a 200 mg dose of avapritinib administered alone, and may result in increased 
adverse  reactions.  Based  on  physiologically-based  pharmacokinetic  (PBPK)  modelling  and  simulation, 
the increase in avapritinib AUC in patients with GIST treated with 300 mg QD is estimated to be 7.5-fold 
and  3.9-fold  at  steady  state  with  concomitant  used  of  strong  CYP3A  inhibitors  itraconazole  and 
Assessment report

ketoconazole, respectively. PBPK modelling and simulation predicted a 1.7-fold and 1.1-fold increase in 
avapritinib AUC from concomitantly used moderate (fluconazole) or mild (cimetidine) CYP3A inhibitors. 
The  Applicant  proposes  that  concomitant  use  of  strong  CYP3A  inhibitors  with  avapritinib  should  be 
avoided as a risk minimisation measure (Section 4.5 SmPC), which appears insufficient considering the 
relevance of the DDI.  
Drugs That May Decrease Avapritinib Plasma Concentrations 
CYP3A Inducers 
In a crossover clinical DDI study in healthy subjects (N=20), coadministration of rifampin (600 mg QD 
for 18 days) with a single 400 mg dose of avapritinib on Day 9 decreased avapritinib Cmax by 74% and 
AUC by 92%, relative to a 400 mg dose of avapritinib administered alone, and may result in decreased 
efficacy. Based on PBPK modeling and simulation, the decrease in avapritinib AUC in patients with GIST 
treated with 300 mg QD is estimated to be 77% at steady state with concomitant use of a moderate 
CYP3A inducer (efavirenz). The Applicant proposes that concomitant use of strong and moderate CYP3A 
inducers should be avoided, which appears of little clinical value.  
Given  the  clinical  relevance  of  these  DDIs,  and  consistent  with  prior  decisions  for  other  TKIs,  the 
Applicant  has  been  requested  to  review  current  information  in  the  SmPC  and  include  appropriate 
information to warm prescribing physicians on this risk, including appropriate risk minimisation measures 
in  Sections  4.4  and  4.5.    The  possibility  to  provide  recommendations  for  dose  adjustments  in  any 
situation is discussed. 
Drugs That May Have Their Plasma Concentrations Altered/Affected by Avapritinib 
Sensitive CYP3A Substrates 
Avapritinib is a direct and time-dependent inhibitor and an inducer of CYP3A in vitro. Caution should be 
exercised with concomitant use of sensitive CYP3A substrates because their plasma concentrations may 
be altered.  
CYP2C9 Substrates 
Avapritinib  is  a  direct  inhibitor  of  CYP2C9  in  vitro.  Therefore,  avapritinib  may  have  the  potential  to 
increase plasma concentrations of drugs that are substrates of CYP2C9. Caution should be exercised with 
coadministration of avapritinib with CYP2C9 substrates. 
Transporter Substrates 
In  vitro,  avapritinib  is  an  inhibitor  of  P-glycoprotein  (P-gp),  breast  cancer  resistance  protein  (BCRP), 
BSEP, multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 1 (MATE1) and 2-K (MATE2-K). Estimated intestinal luminal 
concentration (Igut)/half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values for P-gp and BCRP and maximal 
unbound plasma concentration (Imax,u)/IC50 values for MATE1 and MATE2-K exceeded the regulatory 
thresholds of ≥10 and ≥0.02, respectively. Avapritinib may have the potential for PK drug interactions 
with P-gp, BCRP, MATE1, and MATE2-K substrates. However, clinical studies to investigate the potential 
for transporter-mediated DDIs have not been pursued.  
Avapritinib is an inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP, MATE1, MATE2-K, and BSEP in vitro. Therefore, avapritinib has 
the potential to alter concentrations of co-administered substrates of these transporters. 
At  the  same  time,  avapritinib is  an in  vitro inducer of  CYP3A,  inhibitor  of  CYP2C9,  and  inhibitor  of  P-
glypoprotein  (and  other  transporters).  These  DDIs  have  not  been  investigated  in  vivo,  and  thus,  its 
clinical relevance is uncertain. In vitro studies demonstrated that avapritinib is a direct inhibitor of CYP3A 
and  a  time-dependent  inhibitor  of  CYP3A.  Therefore,  avapritinib  may  have  the  potential  to  increase 
plasma concentrations of co-administered medicinal products that are substrates of CYP3A. 
Assessment report  
EMA/451735/2020  
Page 125/144 
 
 
 
In vitro studies indicated that avapritinib is an inducer of CYP3A. Therefore, avapritinib may have the 
potential to decrease plasma concentrations of co-administered medicinal products that are substrates 
of CYP3A. 
Caution should be exercised with co-administration of avapritinib with narrow therapeutic index CYP3A 
substrates as their plasma concentrations may be altered.  
Discontinuation due to AES 
Patients with GIST  
A total of 19.7% of patients discontinued study drug due to an AE, which appeared to be predominantly 
related to the patients’ underlying disease. The most commonly (≥1%) reported AEs leading to study 
drug  discontinuation  by  PT  were  disease  progression  (3.0%),  general  physical  health  deterioration 
(1.7%), and abdominal pain, acute kidney injury, anaemia, fatigue, and sepsis (1.3%).  
For these patients, 9.0% discontinued study drug due to an AE that was considered treatment-related. 
The following treatment-related AEs led to study drug discontinuation in >1 patient: fatigue (1.7%) and 
confusional state, encephalopathy, nausea, and vomiting (<1% each).  
Post marketing experience 
There is no marketing experience to report for avapritinib.  
During the procedure, two updates of the safety database were provided, one at D120 with the 8th 
July 2019 as new data cut-off and a second one as of cut-off date 9th March 2020. Information in the 
SmPC correspond with the most updated data cut-off point presented as follows:  
Update of the Safety database with cut-off date 9th March 2020 
The  safety  profile  of  avapritinib  has  been  characterized  in  585  patients  with  GIST.  This  includes  250 
patients in  study  BLU-285-1101 who  received treatment  with  avapritinib,  and  473  patients in  study 
BLU-285-1303 who received study treatment, including 239 patients who received avapritinib and 234 
patients who received regorafenib. Of note, 96 patients who received regorafenib in study BLU-285-1303 
crossed  over  to  receive  avapritinib  treatment  due  to  disease  progression  on  the  regorafenib  control 
treatment. This provides an additional 8 months of follow-up for study BLU-285-1101 and an additional 
6 months of follow-up for study BLU-285-1303 compared to the safety data presented in the Applicant’s 
responses to the D120 LoQ. The median treatment duration is 23.2 months both in 1L and 2L+ GIST 
patients included in study BLU-285-1101 and 8.9 months in the GIST patients included in study BLU-
285-1303. 
Safety data from study BLU-285-1101 showed that all patients except for one (>99%) reported any 
AEs, where 80% were ≥G3 (13% fatal G5 AEs), 65% reported SAEs and 27% experienced AEs that led 
to permanent discontinuation. The most common AEs leading to death were disease progression (15/32), 
general physical health deterioration (6/32), sepsis (3/32), and tumor haemorrhage (2/32). Cognitive 
effects were reported by 46% (115/250) of the patients, most cases were mild-moderate AEs (90% G1-
2 AEs, 10% G3 AEs), with a median time to onset of 8.3 weeks and median treatment duration was 12.4 
months in patients who experienced cognitive effects (n=115), and 3.8 months in those patients (54%; 
n=135)  who  did  not  experience  cognitive  effects.  Intracranial  haemorrhages  were  reported  by  3% 
(7/250) of the patients. No fatal cognitive or IC bleeding events were reported. As expected, the safety 
data in the subset of 56 GIST patients with mutation PDGFRA D842V showed consistent results to the 
overall  study  population:  100%  experienced  AEs,  80%  (45/56)  ≥G3  AEs,  57%  (32/56)  SAEs,  21% 
(12/56) AEs that lead to permanent treatment discontinuation.

The safety analysis from BLU-285-1303 is consistent with the safety results reported from BLU-285-
1101 and no new safety signals were identified. Overall, 99% of the patients reported any AEs in the 
avapritinib treatment arm, including 75% ≥G3 AEs (4% G5 AEs), 41% SAEs, and 13% AEs that lead to 
treatment  discontinuation.  The  safety  profile  in  this  study  is  similar  to  that  observed  in  the  phase  1 
study. The figures for regorafenib were: 100% AEs, 70% ≥G3 AEs (5% G5AEs), 36% SAEs, and 11% 
AEs that lead to discontinuation, which are comparable to the safety profile observed for the avapritinib 
treatment arm. Consistent with the overall trend of a slightly less severe safety profile observed in the 
phase 3 trial, cognitive effects were reported by 26% of the patients, 95% G1-2 AEs and 5% G3 AEs, 
and intracranial bleedings were reported in 1% of the patients. No fatal cognitive or IC bleeding events 
were reported. 
Preliminary  safety  data  from  a  total  of  50  unresectable  or  metastatic  GIST  patients  enrolled  in  study 
BLU-285-1105 (in Chinese patients) with the DCO of 31 March 2020, where 8 patients had PDGFRA 
D842V mutations, were largely consistent with those reported in the other avapritinib studies BLU-285-
1101 and BLU-285-1303, and also for other TKIs. Overall, 98% of the patients reported ≥1AE, 38% G1-
2 AEs, 46% G3 AEs and 14% G5 AEs, SAEs were reported by 28% of the patients. No IC bleeding events 
were observed and only 1 cognitive effect (2%) was reported. Although no observations of ICBs and the 
very low number of cognitive effects in this study are fortunate, these results should be interpreted with 
caution as they are only preliminary, and the studied patient population had received the study treatment 
for a short duration of time at the DCO. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  safety  profile  of  avapritinib  has  been  characterized  in  585  patients  with  GIST.  This  includes  250 
patients in  study  BLU-285-1101 who  received treatment  with  avapritinib,  and  473  patients in  study 
BLU-285-1303 who received study treatment, including 239 patients who received avapritinib and 234 
patients who received regorafenib. In total, 96 patients who received regorafenib in study BLU-285-1303 
crossed  over  to  receive  avapritinib  treatment  due  to  disease  progression  on  the  regorafenib  control 
treatment. The median treatment duration is 23.2 months both in 1L and second-line and beyond (2L+) 
GIST patients included in study BLU-285-1101 and 8.9 months in the GIST patients included in study 
BLU-285-1303. 
Safety data from study BLU-285-1101 showed that all patients except for one (>99%) reported any 
AEs, where 80% were ≥G3 (13% fatal G5 AEs), 65% reported SAEs and 27% led to permanent 
discontinuation. The most common AEs leading to death were disease progression (15/32), general 
physical health deterioration (6/32), sepsis (3/32), and tumor haemorrhage (2/32). Cognitive effects 
were reported by 46% (115/250) of the patients, most cases were mild-moderate AEs (90% G1-2 
AEs, 10% G3 AEs), with a median time to onset of 8.3 weeks and median treatment duration  was 12.4 
months in patients who experienced cognitive effects (n=115), and 3.8 months in those patients (54%; 
n=135) who did not experience cognitive effects. Intracranial haemorrhages were reported by 3% 
(7/250) of the patients. No fatal cognitive or IC bleeding events were reported. As expected, the safety 
data in the subset of 56 GIST patients with mutation PDGFRA D842V showed consistent results to the 
overall  study  population:  100%  experienced  AEs,  80%  (45/56)  ≥G3  AEs,  57%  (32/56)  SAEs,  21% 
(12/56) experienced AEs that lead to permanent treatment discontinuation.  
The  safety  analysis  from  the  ongoing  phase  3  study  BLU-285-1303,  that  compares  avapritinib  vs 
regorafenib in GIST patients >2L, is consistent with the safety results reported from BLU-285-1101 and 
no  new  safety  signals  were  identified.  Overall,  99%  of  the  patients  reported  any  AEs  in  the 
avapritinib treatment arm, including 75% ≥G3 AEs (4% G5 AEs), 41% SAEs, and 13% AEs 
that lead to treatment discontinuation. The safety profile in this study is similar to that observed in 
the phase 1 study. The figures for regorafenib were: 100% AEs, 70% ≥G3 AEs (5% G5AEs), 36% SAEs, 
Assessment report  
EMA/451735/2020

and 11% AEs that lead to discontinuation, which are comparable to the safety profile observed for the 
avapritinib  treatment  arm.  Consistent  with  the  overall  trend  of  a  slightly  less  severe  safety  profile 
observed in the phase 3 trial, cognitive effects were reported by 26% of the patients, 95% G1-2 
AEs  and  5%  G3  AEs,  and  intracranial  bleedings  were  reported  in  1%  of  the  patients.  No  fatal 
cognitive  or  IC  bleeding  events  were  reported.  The  Applicant  argues  that  early  recognition  and 
management  of  cognitive  effects  as  a  consequence  of  more  careful  attention  to  instructions  for  dose 
modification of cognitive effects might explain the lower incidence. Although this argumentation may be 
true,  it  is  noticed  that  the  treatment  duration  in  the  -1303  study  compared  to  the  -1101  study  is 
considerably shorter, see above. 
Preliminary  safety  data  from  a  total  of  50  unresectable  or  metastatic  GIST  patients  enrolled  in  study 
BLU-285-1105 (in Chinese patients) with the DCO of 31 March 2020, where 8 patients had PDGFRA 
D842V mutations, were largely consistent with those reported in the other avapritinib studies BLU-285-
1101 and BLU-285-1303, and also for other TKIs. 
The safety profile observed in studies BLU-285-1101 and BLU-285-1303 showed that almost all patients 
reported AEs, and the most commonly reported AEs were largely consistent with that reported for other 
TKIs. The distribution of AEs by severity appear similar between the studies and across treatment arms. 
Based on the pooled analysis of studies BLU-285-1101 and BLU-285-1303 (as now included in section 
4.8 of the SmPC), the most frequently reported treatment related AEs of any grade during treatment 
with  avapritinib  were  nausea  (45%),  fatigue  (40%),  anaemia  (39%),  periorbital  oedema  (33%), 
hyperbilirubinaemia  (27%),  face  oedema  (27%),  diarrhoea  (26%),  vomiting  (24%),  blood  bilirubin 
increased  (24%),  oedema  peripheral  (23%),  lacrimation  increased  (22%),  and  decreased  appetite 
(21%) and memory impairment (20%). Among these, anaemia, abdominal pain, sepsis, physical health 
deterioration,  and  GI  haemorrhages  were  commonly  reported  as  SAEs  during  avapritinib  treatment, 
some leading to permanent discontinuation or even had a fatal outcome. 
In summary, avapritinib presents substantial toxicity, as shown by the high incidence of severe, including 
life-threatening and fatal, adverse events. The safety profile is consistent with that seen for other TKIs, 
with significant gastrointestinal and hematological toxicities. Haemorrhages, including IC bleedings, and 
cognitive  effects  are  AEs  of  particular  concern.  The  update  of  safety  data  provided  is  somewhat 
reassuring  given  that  the  frequency  of  G5  AEs,  SAEs,  and  AEs  leading  to  treatment  discontinuation 
tended to be lower in the controlled phase 3 trial than those initially reported in the phase 1 study, and 
similar  to  the  frequencies  observed  in  the  regorafenib  control  arm.  Similarly,  less  AESIs  of  cognitive 
effects and intracranial bleeding were reported in the phase 3 trial. Thus, it can be argued that to some 
extent the toxicity is manageable with appropriate risk minimization measures, including lower starting 
dose and restrictions for dose escalation, closer monitoring of AEs, and careful selection of candidates to 
treatment.  However,  long-term  follow-up  is  still  needed  to  properly  characterise  the  safety  profile  of 
avapritinib, particularly for patients in the 1L disease setting.  
There  are  no  data  from  the  use  of  avapritinib  in  pregnant  women.  Studies  in  animals  have  shown 
reproductive toxicity (see section 2.3.4. Toxicology). Avapritinib is not recommended during pregnancy 
and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception.  
If avapritinib is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking avapritinib, the 
patient should be advised of the potential risk to the foetus. 
It  is  unknown  whether  avapritinib/  metabolites  are  excreted  in  human  milk.  A  risk  to  the 
newborns/infants  cannot  be  excluded.  Breast-feeding  should  be  discontinued  during  treatment  with 
avapritinib and for 2 weeks following the final dose (see section 4.6 of the SmPC). 
Avapritinib may cause adverse reactions such as cognitive effects that may influence the ability to drive 
and use machines. Patients should be made aware of the potential for adverse effects that affect their 
Assessment report  
EMA/451735/2020  
Page 128/144 
 
 
 
ability to concentrate and react. Patients who experience these adverse effects should take special care 
when driving a car or operating machinery (see section 4.7 of the SmPC). 
The  observed  higher  incidence  of  SAEs,  including  fatal  events,  and  AEs  leading  to  treatment 
discontinuation  in  the  elderly  population  is  considered  relevant  information  for  prescribing  physicians 
and has been appropriately reflected in Section 4.8 of the SmPC. I 
Additional safety data needed in the context of a conditional MA  
In the context of a CMA additional safety data will be provided as SOBs:  
• Study BLU-285-1101: Final CSR by 2H 2021 
• Study BLU-285-1303: Final CSR by 1H 2021 
Final CSRs from studies BLU-285-1101 and BLU-285-1303 will include all available data on the safety 
and efficacy of avapritinib in patients with PDGFRA D842V-mutant GIST (n = 51).  
• Study BLU-285-1406: A new observational long-term safety and efficacy study in treatment naïve 
patients with unresectable or metastatic PDGFRA D842V-mutant GIST. Final study report to be provided 
by December 2027. This proposed study will be set up to collect long-term (minimum 2 years) safety 
and efficacy data in approximately 50 GIST patients in the 1L disease setting harbouring the PDGFRA 
D842V mutation. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety database includes a total of 585 patients with GIST (all doses), of which 550 patients received 
avapritinib at a starting dose of 300 mg or 400 mg. This includes 250 patients in study BLU-285-1101, 
239  patients  in  study  BLU-285-1303  who  received  treatment  with  avapritinib  and  96  patients  who 
received regorafenib in study BLU-285-1303 and then crossed over to receive avapritinib treatment due 
to disease progression on the regorafenib control treatment. 
Based  on  the  totality  of  the  evidence  available,  it  is  concluded  that  avapritinib  presents  substantial 
toxicity, as shown by the high incidence of severe, including life-threatening and fatal adverse events. 
The safety profile is nevertheless consistent with that seen for other TKIs, with significant gastrointestinal 
and  haematological  toxicities.  Haemorrhages,  including  IC  bleedings,  and  cognitive  effects  are  AEs  of 
particular concern. The most updated data provided are somewhat reassuring given that the frequency 
of  G5  AEs,  SAEs,  and  AEs  leading  to  treatment  discontinuation  tended  to  be  lower  to  those  initially 
reported in the phase 1 study, and similar to the frequencies observed in the regorafenib control arm. 
Similarly,  less  AESIs  of  cognitive  effects  and  intracranial  bleeding  were  reported  in  the  phase  3  trial. 
Thus, it can be argued that to some extent the toxicity is manageable with appropriate risk minimization 
measures, including lower starting dose and restrictions for dose escalation, closer monitoring of AEs, 
and careful selection of candidates to treatment.  
Nevertheless,  although  considered  acceptable  in  view  of  the  high  efficacy  shown,  and  overall 
manageable, the substantial toxicity of avapritinib requires an adequate selection and close monitoring 
of patients. To this aim, information in sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC has been notably extended 
in order to provide accurate and useful information for the prescribing physician.  
Finally, long-term follow-up is still needed as uncertainties still remain on the safety profile of 
avapritinib, particularly in patients treated in the 1L GIST disease setting. In order to address 
remaining uncertainties, the Applicant has committed to provide additional evidence on safety (and 
efficacy) during the post-marketing. In particular, final study results of the two ongoing studies will be

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 0.4 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 09.01.2020. The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers avapritinib to be a new active substance as it is not 
a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
Assessment report  
EMA/451735/2020  
Page 134/144 
 
 
 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Avapritinib Blueprint Medicines (avapritinib) 
is included in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 
2011, was not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The following indication is being sought:  
Treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) 
harbouring the platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) D842V mutation. 
Gastrointestinal stromal tumour is a rare sarcoma that arises from the interstitial cells of Cajal and 
occurs throughout the GI tract. 
The indication in 4L+ GIST population was withdrawn by the applicant during the procedure. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Chemotherapy and radiation therapy are ineffective in the population with GIST harbouring the platelet-
derived  growth  factor  receptor  alpha  (PDGFRA)  D842V  mutation,  so  the  current  treatment  scheme 
involves sequential administration of the TKIs imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib. In the general GIST 
population, ORR and median PFS decrease with each subsequent TKI, from 60% ORR and median PFS 
of 18-24 months (Demetri et al, 2002; Blanke et al, 2008) with imatinib down to 5-7% ORR and median 
PFS of 5-6 months with sutinib  and regorafenib (Demetri et al, 2006; Demetri et al, 2013). Once the 
patient continues to progress while on regorafenib, the options are TKI re-challenge, best supportive or 
inclusion in a clinical trial (Casali et al, 2018; ESMO, 2018; NCCN, 2018). 
The GIST patients carrying the PDGFRA D842V mutation are described as refractory to TKI treatment 
(Heinrich et al, 2003a; Cassier et al, 2012). In studies conducted in 1L patients, the ORR ranged from 
0-12%, with median PFS of only 3 to 5 months, OS of approximately 15 months (Cassier et al, 2012; 
Yoo et al, 2016). Therefore, patients with PDGFRA D842V mutated GIST represent an unmet medical 
need that avapritinib attempts to fulfil. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The Applicant provided one single pivotal study (NAVIGATOR study) to support the claimed indication. 
This is an on-going Phase 1, first-in-human, dose-escalation, expansion, open-label study to evaluate 
the safety, tolerability, PK, PD and efficacy of avapritinib in adults with unresectable GIST. The population 
included in the initial proposed indication is composed by two different patient subsets:  
- GIST patients who had received 3L+ of prior therapies (4L+ population, n=121); 
- GIST patients carrying the PDGFRA D842V mutation, regardless of number of prior therapies 
(n=38).  
Study BLU-285-1303 (VOYAGER) is a global, open-label, randomized, Phase 3 trial designed to evaluate 
the  efficacy  and  safety  of  avapritinib  versus  regorafenib  in  patients  with  ≥3L  GIST.  Patients  were 
randomized 1:1 to receive either avapritinib (300 mg QD dosing) or regorafenib (160 mg QD dosing for 
3 out of every 4 weeks).  
During the procedure, the Applicant withdrew the 4L+ indication from this MAA. 
Assessment report  
EMA/451735/2020  
Page 136/144 
 
 
 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In the PDGFRA D842V mutated GIST population (n=38), initial ORR was 90% (95% CI: 75.2%, 
97.1%), while median DOR, PFS and median OS were not reached (PFS rate at 18 months of 71%). 
The most recent data (snapshot DCO date: 17-04-2020) is consistent with the previously submitted 
one and confirm a high and durable response : ORR of 95% (95% CI: 82.3, 99.4), median PFS of 24 
months (95% CI: 18.4, NE), and a DOR of 22.1 months (95% CI: 14.1, NE), while the median OS has 
not been reached yet (36-months OS rate is 70.6% (95% CI: 55.2, 86.0). 
Among the patients with the PDGFRA D842V mutation from the ongoing, controlled, phase III study 
BLU-285-1301 (VOYAGER), ORR in the avapritinib group is 42.9% (all partial responses) while none of 
the patients in the regorafenib group responded (0% ORR). Regarding median PFS in the population 
with the PDGFRA D842V mutation, there was a statistically significant difference, with a non estimable 
median PFS in patients with PDGFRA D842V mutations randomized to avapritinib (95% CI: 9.7, NE) 
compared to 4.5 months in patients receiving regorafenib (95% CI: 1.7, NE). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Results from the phase III study (VOYAGER) are of a smaller magnitude than those reported in study 
BLU-285-1101 (NAVIGATOR). Several factors could have played a role in the differences observed, such 
as the small sample size across, shorter duration of follow-up and different therapy settings in terms of 
prior TKI treatments, since most patients from BLU-285-1101 were either TKI naïve or had received 1 
prior TKI (13.2% and 47.4%, respectively), while patients in study BLU-285-1301 are at a later stage of 
the disease (≥3L). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety database includes a total of 585 patients with GIST (all doses), of which 550 patients received 
avapritinib at a starting dose of 300 mg or 400 mg.  This includes 250 patients in study BLU-285-1101 
who received treatment with avapritinib, and 473 patients in study BLU-285-1303 who received study 
treatment, including 239 patients who received avapritinib and 234 patients who received regorafenib. 
In total, 96 patients who received regorafenib in study BLU-285-1303 crossed over to receive avapritinib 
treatment  due  to  disease  progression  on  the  regorafenib  control  treatment.  The  median  treatment 
duration is 23.2 months both in 1L and second-line and beyond (2L+) GIST patients included in study 
BLU-285-1101 and 8.9 months in the GIST patients included in study BLU-285-1303 (patients with the 
D842V mutation). 
Safety data from study BLU-285-1101 showed that all patients except for one (>99%) reported any 
AEs, where 80% were ≥G3 (13% fatal G5 AEs), 65% reported SAEs and 27% led to permanent 
discontinuation.  
The  most  common  AEs  leading  to  death  were  disease  progression  (15/32),  general  physical  health 
deterioration (6/32), sepsis (3/32), and tumor haemorrhage (2/32). Cognitive effects were reported 
by 46% (115/250) of the patients, most cases were mild-moderate AEs (90% G1-2 AEs, 10% G3 AEs), 
with a median time to onset of 8.3 weeks and median treatment duration was 12.4 months in patients 
who experienced cognitive effects (n=115), and 3.8 months in those patients (54%; n=135) who did 
not experience cognitive effects. Intracranial haemorrhages were reported by 3% (7/250) of the 
patients.  No  fatal  cognitive  or  IC  bleeding  events  were  reported.  As  expected,  the  safety  data  in  the 
subset of 56 GIST patients with mutation PDGFRA D842V showed consistent results to the overall study 
population: 100% experienced AEs, 80% (45/56) ≥G3 AEs, 57% (32/56) SAEs, 21% (12/56) AEs that 
lead to permanent treatment discontinuation.  
Assessment report  
EMA/451735/2020  
Page 137/144 
 
 
 
The  safety  analysis  from  the  ongoing  phase  3  study  BLU-285-1303,  that  compares  avapritinib  vs 
regorafenib in GIST patients >2L, is consistent with the safety results reported from BLU-285-1101 and 
no  new  safety  signals  were  identified.  Overall,  99%  of  the  patients  reported  any  AEs  in  the 
avapritinib treatment arm, including 75% ≥G3 AEs (4% G5 AEs), 41% SAEs, and 13% AEs 
that lead to treatment discontinuation.   
Based on the pooled analysis of studies BLU-285-1101 and BLU-285-1303 (as now included in section 
4.8 of the SmPC), the most frequently reported treatment related AEs of any grade during treatment 
with  avapritinib  were  nausea  (45%),  fatigue  (40%),  anaemia  (39,6%),  periorbital  oedema  (33%), 
hyperbilirubinaemia  (27%),  face  oedema  (27%),  diarrhoea  (26%),  vomiting  (24%),  blood  bilirubin 
increased  (24%),  oedema  peripheral  (23%),  lacrimation  increased  (22%),  decreased  appetite  (21%) 
and  memory  impairment  (20%).    Among  these,  anaemia,  abdominal  pain,  sepsis,  physical  health 
deterioration,  and  GI  haemorrhages  were  commonly  reported  as  SAEs  during  avapritinib  treatment, 
some leading to permanent discontinuation or even had a fatal outcome. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The main limitations of the safety database are related to difficulties in establishing a causal relationship 
with avapritinib for key adverse events in the context of non-controlled studies and of a severe underlying 
condition. In addition, the limited exposure data, raise important uncertainties on the actual safety profile 
of avapritinib. The new information presented, which includes preliminary comparative (vs regorafenib) 
safety data from the ongoing phase 3 trial, alleviates to some extent the concerns given that the overall 
incidence of AEs, SAEs, >G3 AEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation tended to be lower in the phase 3 
trial and comparable to those seen in the regorafenib treatment arm. 
There are uncertainties about the mechanism behind the IC bleeding serious risk, possible risk factors, 
and the potential relation between avapritinib and bleedings in various locations with focus on potential 
underlying  patterns  and  mechanisms.  Although  uncertainties  still  remain,  the  new  data  submitted 
showed lower incidences and severity of these AEs, which is somewhat reassuring and may indicate that 
appropriate risk minimisation measures including lower starting dose and restrictions for dose escalation 
may be implemented to reduce the risk.  Interruption of treatment with or without dose reduction may 
be considered to manage adverse reactions based on severity and clinical presentation (section 4.2 of 
the SmPC).  
Therefore, information in the SmPC has been substantially extended to provide an accurate and helpful 
information to physicians. In addition, to address remaining uncertainties, the Applicant has committed 
to further assess these risks within the agreed SOBs.  
However,  long-term  safety  data  are  still  limited,  which  is  an  important  uncertainty  in  particular  for 
patients treated in first line due to longer exposure to the drug. This uncertainty will be further evaluated 
in the context of the agreed SOBs. 
There are remaining uncertainties related to the appropriateness and usefulness of the risk minimisation 
measures proposed to manage some key adverse events, including cognitive disorders, GI events, and 
fluid retention. However, based on current knowledge, the SmPC has been updated to include appropiate 
precautionary  statements  concerning  the  most  relevant  risks  and  where  possible,  appropriate  risk 
minimization  measures,  including  lower  starting  dose  and  restrictions  for  dose  escalation,  closer 
monitoring of AEs, and careful selection of candidates to treatment.  
The actual risk for QT prolongation and arrhythmias during avapritinib treatment is uncertain, given that 
a dedicated QT study has not been conducted, patients with risk factors were systematically excluded 
from  study  participation,  results  of  the  ECG  substudy  have  not  been  presented  according  to  ICH 
Assessment report  
EMA/451735/2020  
Page 138/144 
 
 
 
requirements, and simulations conducted do not cover exposures that could be found in clinical practice 
(e.g.  concomitant  use  with  strong  CYP3A4  inhibitors).  This  risk  has  been  included  as  an  important 
potential safety risk in the Safety Specifications and the studies agreed as SOBs will provide additional 
data  to  better  characterise  the  risk.  The  SmPC  has  also  been  updated  to  include  accurate  and  useful 
information to the prescribing physicians.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
GIST is a rare disorder and the proportion of patients expressing the PDGFRA D842V mutation is even 
smaller.  It  is  acknowledged  that  the  presence  of  the  D842V  mutation  seems to  provide  resistance  or 
very  little  response  to  TKI  (Farag  et  al.,  JCO  2016  34:15_suppl,  11011-11011).  Furthermore,  even 
though  data  is  mainly  focused  on  imatinib  and  to  a  lesser  extent  on  sunitinib  (Hirota  et  al. 
Gastroenterology 2003), the D842V mutant GIST do not show any actionable recurrent molecular events 
of therapeutic significance (Indio et al. Int J Mol Sci. 2018).  
Overall,  the  efficacy  of  avapritinib  is  currently  based  on  results  from  a  total  of  59  patients  (from  the 
NAVIGATOR, VOYAGER and BLU-285-1105 studies). The pivotal evidence supporting this application is 
a  single  arm  trial  (NAVIGATOR)  with  ORR  as  primary  endpoint  in  a  limited  sample  size  (n=38).  ORR

results  in  the  population  with  the  PDGFRA  D842V  mutation,  are  unprecedented  in  this  patient 
population, with 36 (94.7%) out of 38 patients achieving an ORR (81.6% PR), with a median DOR of 22 
months  and  median  PFS  of  24  months  (median  OS  not  yet  reached).  Data  on  patients  naïve  to  TKIs 
appear  consistent  with  that  of  the  overall  D842V-mutant  group,  but  is  even  more  limited  (n=5). 
However, it is agreed that in the D842V mutant GIST patient population ORR results are unprecedented 
and  results  would  not  be  expected  to  be  of  a  lesser  magnitude  in  the  1L  setting,  and  the  benefit  is 
considered to be demonstrated regardless of the line of treatment. 
Supportive data from the phase III, controlled study and the phase I study in Chinese patients also show 
favourable and clinically relevant results, although of smaller magnitude. 
- The available data support the benefit of avapritinib in the intended target population. 
In addition, the impressive result in term of durable responses compares favourably with that reported 
from the literature for other TKIs in the target population. Overall, the reported results in the population 
with  the  PDGFRA  D842V  are  considered  relevant  in  the  context  of  a  patient  population  with  limited 
treatment  options  and  poor  responses  to  approved  TKI  agents.  This  benefit  is  considered  clinically 
meaningful. 
The safety database has been substantially extended throughout the procedure, and the safety profile 
of avapritinib has now been characterized based on 585 patients with GIST. As of the last DCO, 9th March 
2020, the median treatment duration is 23.2 months both in 1L and 2L and beyond (2L+) GIST patients 
included in study BLU-285-1101 and 8.9 months in the GIST patients included in study BLU-285-1303, 
which provides some preliminary comparative safety data. The safety profile is largely consistent with 
that reported for other TKIs. Based on the pooled analysis of studies BLU-285-1101 and BLU-285-1303, 
the most frequently reported treatment related AEs of any grade during treatment with avapritinib were 
nausea (45%), fatigue (40%), anaemia (39%), periorbital oedema (33%), hyperbilirubinaemia (27%), 
face  oedema  (27%),  diarrhoea  (26%),  vomiting  (24%),  blood  bilirubin  increased  (24%),  oedema 
peripheral (23%), lacrimation increased (22%), and decreased appetite (21%) and memory impairment 
(20%).  Among  these,  anaemia,  abdominal  pain,  sepsis,  physical  health  deterioration,  and  GI 
haemorrhages  were  commonly  reported  as  SAEs  during  avapritinib  treatment,  some  leading  to 
permanent discontinuation or even had a fatal outcome. 
For avapritinib, intracranial bleedings and GI/tumour haemorrhages have been reported, which remain 
as  AEs  of  important  concern.  Cognitive  disorders  were  very  frequently  reported,  ranging  from  mild 
memory impairment events (mostly) to severe encephalopathy (few cases). Finally, as for other TKIs, 
reduced 
appetite 
and 
laboratory 
changes 
including  hypokalaemia,  hypophosphatemia, 
hyperbilirubinemia and ALT increases have been reported and monitoring activities have been proposed.  
Avapritinib  presents  substantial  toxicity,  as  shown  by  the  high  incidence  of  severe,  including  life-
threatening  and  fatal  adverse  events.  The  safety  profile  is  nevertheless  consistent  with  that  seen  for 
other TKIs, with significant gastrointestinal and haematological toxicities. Haemorrhages, including IC 
bleedings,  and  cognitive  effects  are  AEs  of  particular  concern.  The  most  updated  data  provided  are 
somewhat  reassuring  given  that  the  frequency  of  G5  AEs,  SAEs,  and  AEs  leading  to  treatment 
discontinuation tended to be lower to those initially reported in the phase 1 study, and similar to the 
frequencies  observed  in  the  regorafenib  control  arm.  Similarly,  less  AESIs  of  cognitive  effects  and 
intracranial bleeding were reported in the phase 3 trial. Thus, it can be argued that to some extent the 
toxicity is manageable with appropriate risk minimization measures, including lower starting dose and 
restrictions for dose escalation, closer monitoring of AEs, and careful selection of candidates to treatment 
as described in the SmPC.  
Finally,  longer-term  follow-up  is  still  needed  as  uncertainties  still  remain  on  the  safety  profile  of 
avapritinib, particularly in patients treated in the 1L GIST disease setting.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
In view of the substantial, although manageable, toxicity of avapritinib, adequate patient selection and 
surveillance are important. In addition, this safety profile should be considered within the context of the 
substantial  efficacy  shown,  with  high  and  durable  responses,  which  are  unprecedented  in  a  patient 
population resistant to traditional TKI therapy. Therefore, the CHMP consider the benefit-risk balance of 
avapritinib in patients with unresectable or metastatic PDGFRA D842V-mutant GIST to be positive. 
Conditional marketing authorisation 
As comprehensive clinical data on the safety and efficacy of the medicinal product are not available, a 
conditional marketing authorisation was requested by the applicant in the initial submission. 
The  product  falls  within  the  scope  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  507/2006  concerning  conditional  marketing 
authorisations, as it aims at the treatment of a life-threatening disease and is designated as an orphan 
medicinal product.  
Results in the population with the PDGFRA D842V mutation 
1)  Positive Risk Benefit Profile: the Applicant has presented high and durable tumour responses in 
a  small  sample  size  (n=38),  which  represent  an unprecedented  clinical  activity  in  this  patient 
population regardless of prior line of therapy. Preliminary results from the controlled, randomized 
phase 3 VOYAGER study (n=13) show supportive ORR data (42.9% vs. 0%, for avapritinib and 
regorafenib, respectively) and statistically significant differences in terms of median PFS in favour 
of avapritinib (NE vs 4.5 months, respectively). 
It  is  acknowledged that  GIST  is  a  rare  disorder  and  the proportion  of  patients  expressing  the 
PDGFRA D842V mutation is even smaller. Nevertheless, the available data continue to support 
the outstanding  benefit  of  avapritinib  in  the intended  target  population.  This  requirement has 
been met. 
2)  Likelihood that Comprehensive Clinical Data will be Provided:  
In  order  to  provide  comprehensive  efficacy  and  safety  data  and  to  address  remaining 
uncertainties  needed  to  support  the  switching  from  conditional  to  normal  marketing 
authorisation, the following SOBs are proposed:  
• Study BLU-285-1101: Final CSR by 2H 2021. This study is currently ongoing and recruitment 
has been completed, with a total of 38 patients with the PDGFRA D842V mutation being included. 
The Applicant has committed to provide the final CSR by 2021.  
• Study BLU-285-1303: Final CSR by 1H 2021. The Applicant included approximately 3% (n=13) 
of  patients  with  the  PDGFRA  D842V  mutationin  the  VOYAGER  study.  Mutation  status  is  a 
stratification factor, so patients have been evenly balanced between both treatment groups. This 
study  is  also  currently  ongoing  and  the  Applicant  has  committed  to  provide  the  final  CSR  by 
2021.  
• Study BLU-285-1406: A new observational long-term safety and efficacy study in treatment 
naïve patients with unresectable or metastatic PDGFRA D842V-mutant GIST. Final study report 
to be provided by December 2027. Draft protocol: to be submitted at the latest 2 months after 
EC Decision. Enrolment update to be provided within each PSUR cycle. Annual interim reports 
will be provided within the annual renewal as of the second annual renewal.  
Final CSRs from studies BLU-285-1101 and BLU-285-1303 will include all available data on the 
safety and efficacy of avapritinib in patients with PDGFRA D842V-mutant GIST (n=51). The final 
study results in the 2L+ GIST patients demonstrate an equivalent median duration of exposure 
Assessment report

Page 142/144 
 
 
 
to avapritinib as those in the 1L setting (23.2 months in both populations), indicating that safety 
and  efficacy  are  similar  despite  prior  line  of  treatment,  and  are  therefore  considered  relevant 
when assessing avapritinib in the 1L disease setting. The newly proposed study BLU-285-1406 
will contribute with long-term (minimum 2 years) safety and efficacy data in approximately 50 
GIST patients in the 1L disease setting harbouring the PDGFRA D842V mutation.  Overall, the 
proposed  SOBs  will  contribute  to  obtaining  comprehensive  clinical  data  in  approximately  100 
patients with PDGFRA D842V-mutant GIST. It appears likely that the Applicant will be able to be 
provide these data and feasibility will not be an issue. 
3)  Unmet Need Fulfilled: this requirement could be considered fulfilled since the activity of currently 
used treatments is almost negligible in GIST patients with the D842V mutation. 
4)  Benefit to Public Health of Immediate Availability Outweighs Risk that Additional Data are Still 
Required: The outstanding activity shown in the context of a population with an unmet medical 
need  renders  the  limited  evidence  acceptable  to  grant  approval.  In  addition,  the  positive  B/R 
balance has been demonstrated in the intended indication. Therefore, this requirement has been 
met. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Avapritinib Blueprint Medicines is positive.

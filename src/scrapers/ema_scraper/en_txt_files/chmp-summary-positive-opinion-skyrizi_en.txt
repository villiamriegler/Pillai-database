Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Skyrizi 
risankizumab 
On 28 February 2019, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Skyrizi, intended 
for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis. The applicant for this medicinal product is AbbVie 
Deutschland GmbH & Co. KG. 
Skyrizi will be available as a 75 mg solution for injection. The active substance of Skyrizi is risankizumab, a 
monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to the p19 subunit of human interleukin 23 (IL-23), a cytokine 
involved in inflammatory and immune responses (ATC code: L04AC). 
The benefits with Skyrizi are its ability to block IL-23 from binding to its receptor, therefore inhibiting the 
release of proinflammatory cytokines involved in psoriasis disease. The most common side effects are upper 
respiratory infections, which occurred in 13% of patients. 
The full indication is: “Skyrizi is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults 
who are candidates for systemic therapy”.  
It is proposed that Skyrizi be prescribed by physicians experienced in the treatment of psoriasis. 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the European public assessment report (EPAR) and made 
available in all official European Union languages after the marketing authorisation has been granted by the 
European Commission.

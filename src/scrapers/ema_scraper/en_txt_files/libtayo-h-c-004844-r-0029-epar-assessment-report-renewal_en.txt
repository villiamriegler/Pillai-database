1.  Background information on the annual renewal 
The European Commission issued on 28 June 2019, a conditional marketing authorisation (MA) for 
LIBTAYO This implied that, pursuant to Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and Article 5 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 507/2006, the marketing authorisation holder (MAH) has to complete 
ongoing studies, or to conduct new studies, as listed in Annex II.E of the MA, the so-called Specific 
Obligations (SOBs). These data form the basis of the renewal of the conditional MA. 
A conditional MA is valid for one year and may be renewed annually upon request by the MAH. 
Therefore, pursuant to Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and Article 6(2) of Commission 
Regulation (EC) No 507/2006, the MAH Regeneron Ireland Designated Activity Company (DAC), 
submitted to the Agency on 6 January 2022 an application for renewal of the conditional MA for 
LIBTAYO. The expiry date of the MA is 2 July 2022. 
While the final CSR is not yet available for Groups 1 to 3, the MAH considers that the additional 
Group 1 to 3 data further confirm the efficacy and safety of cemiplimab for the treatment of patients 
with mCSCC or laCSCC who are not candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation. As such, the 
MAH proposes that this SOB (ANX/FSR 002) be re-categorised as a post-authorisation efficacy study to 
be included under commitments in Annex IID of the LIBTAYO EU Product Information, retaining the 
same due date of 31 Oct 2022, and that the corresponding sections of the EU RMP be updated 
accordingly. This proposal was agreed upon with the EMA Rapporteurs in May 2021. 
The MAH considers that each of the aspects of the 2 SOBs are fulfilled by the data included in the 
present dossier. The data further confirm the efficacy and safety of cemiplimab for the treatment of 
patients with metastatic or locally advanced CSCC who are not candidates for curative surgery or 
curative radiation. The data further confirm that PD-L1 expression is not predictive of efficacy in 
advanced CSCC. Furthermore, positive data in additional tumor types (NSCLC and BCC) have further 
contributed to our understanding of the benefit/risk profile of cemiplimab since the initial CMA was 
granted. As such, the position of the MAH is that sufficient data are available to grant a standard MA 
for LIBTAYO within the present annual renewal. The MAH proposes to maintain a commitment to 
submit the final CSR for Groups 1 to 3 by 31 October 2022. 
The application contained a justification in support of the possible granting of a marketing authorisation 
not subject to specific obligations. 
2.  Overall conclusions and benefit-risk balance 
As part of the CMA two SOBs where adopted. The MAH was asked to provide the final CSR for Groups 
1-3 and to add a Group 6 in order to confirm efficacy and safety of cemiplimab in CSCC. As agreed at a 
meeting in May 2021, the MAH provides updated results from Groups 1-3 and the interim results of 
Group 6. With the submission of these data, the MAH is proposing is seeking a standard MA for Libtayo 
within the annual renewal. The MAH commits to submitting the final CSR for Groups 1-3 by 31 October 
2022. This can be submitted as a PAM-REC. 
The data show overall comparison between Groups 1-3 and Group 6 in terms of baseline 
characteristics. With regards to efficacy, the updated ORR and DOR from Groups 1-3 continue to show 
clinically meaningful benefit, and the ORR and DOR observed in Group 6 are in line with Group 1-3. 
The MAH has excluded two patients from the efficacy evaluation in Group 6. Both patients didn’t 
receive any treatment with cemiplimab. Thus, their exclusion is endorsed. 
Approximately half of the 84 patients in scope of the interim analysis in Group 6 had an available 
baseline tumor sample. The numbers are small, but it can with reasonable likelihood be concluded that 
Assessment report  
EMA/665912/2022 
Page 5/128 
 
 
 
 
efficacy of cemiplimab is not predicted by PD-L1 expression in CSCC. The results show clinical benefit 
irrespective of PD-L1 expression. This supports the continued use of cemiplimab in all-comers in this 
specific clinical setting. 
In terms of safety, the observed safety findings in Group 6 are in line with the known safety profile of 
cemiplimab. Almost all patients experienced an TEAE (98.8%). Approximately 39% experienced a 
Grade ≥3 AEs, and 40.2% an SAE. The most common AEs continue to be fatigue, pruritus, rash and 
diarrhoea. There are no new safety findings. A few OCs have been identified and were addressed by 
the MAH.  
Since the last annual renewal in January 2021, the CHMP has given positive opinion for two additional 
indications in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC), resulting in 
approvals by the European Commission in June 2021. Furthermore, two procedures are ongoing in 
CHMP at the moment.  
Overall, the efficacy of cemiplimab has been confirmed in several different settings, and with the 
submission of updated data from Groups 1-3 and interim data from Group 6, there are no longer any 
regulatory nor clinical arguments to keep cemiplimab on CMA. 
In conclusion, the Rapporteur is of the opinion that Specific Obligation has been fulfilled, and therefore 
recommends its deletion from the Annex II.  
The B/R balance of Libtayo remains unchanged and positive in the approved indications. 
2.1.  Specific Obligations (SOBs) 
Compliance of SOB data submitted 
During the period covered by this annual renewal data on the SOBs have been submitted that overall 
are compliant in terms of adherence to deadlines and are compliant in terms of acceptability of data 
submitted. 
As part of this annual renewal the CHMP is of the opinion that the following obligations have been 
fulfilled, and therefore recommends their deletion from the Annex II: 
1.  In order to confirm the efficacy and safety of cemiplimab for the treatment of patients with 
metastatic or locally advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma who are not candidates for 
curative surgery or curative radiation, the MAH should provide interim data of a single-arm trial 
in the same population [study 1540 group 6]. The MAH should investigate biomarkers in order 
to confirm that PD-L1 expression is not predictive of efficacy. The study should be conducted 
according to an agreed protocol. 
2.  In order to confirm the efficacy and safety of cemiplimab for the treatment of patients with 
metastatic or locally advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma who are not candidates for 
curative surgery or curative radiation, the MAH should submit the final study report for Groups 
1-3 in the phase 2 pivotal study 1540. 
The last SOB has been fulfilled and the data available concerning this product is considered 
comprehensive; therefore, there are no remaining Specific Obligations.

EMA/665912/2022 
Page 6/128 
 
 
 
 
 
2.2.  Benefit-risk Balance 
During the period covered by this annual renewal, new data have emerged. However, these data do 
not have an impact on the benefit-risk of LIBTAYO in the approved indications. 
The data collected as part of the specific obligations for LIBTAYO during the period covered by this 
annual renewal supported its positive benefit-risk balance in the approved indications. 
3.  Recommendations 
Based on the review of the available information on the status of the fulfilment of Specific Obligations, 
the benefit-risk balance for LIBTAYO in its approved indication(s) (please refer to the Summary of 
Product Characteristics) continues to be favourable and all specific obligations have been fulfilled, and 
therefore the granting of a marketing authorisation no longer subject to specific obligations is 
recommended, subject to the conditions and obligations as detailed in this assessment report. 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of new data submitted as part of the renewal application amendments to Annexes I, II and IIIB 
are recommended. 
Updates to the Product Information were made in line with the SmPC guideline and the latest QRD 
template (version 10.2). 
The following obligations has been fulfilled, and therefore it is recommended that it be deleted from the 
Annex II to the opinion: 
1.  In order to confirm the efficacy and safety of cemiplimab for the treatment of patients with 
metastatic or locally advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma who are not candidates for 
curative surgery or curative radiation, the MAH should provide interim data of a single-arm trial 
in the same population [study 1540 group 6]. The MAH should investigate biomarkers in order 
to confirm that PD-L1 expression is not predictive of efficacy. The study should be conducted 
according to an agreed protocol. 
2.  In order to confirm the efficacy and safety of cemiplimab for the treatment of patients with 
metastatic or locally advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma who are not candidates for 
curative surgery or curative radiation, the MAH should submit the final study report for Groups 
1-3 in the phase 2 pivotal study 1540. 
Please refer to the Attachment which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information.

receptor.  Study 1540 is evaluating efficacy, safety, and PK of cemiplimab in patients with either 
mCSCC or with laCSCC.  The patient population for Groups 1, 2, 3, and 6 are as follows: 
•  Group 1 consists of patients with mCSCC who received cemiplimab 3 mg/kg as an intravenous 
(IV) infusion over 30 minutes every 2 weeks (Q2W).  
•  Group 2 consists of patients with laCSCC who were not candidates for surgery or radiation, and 
received cemiplimab 3 mg/kg as an IV infusion over 30 minutes Q2W.  
•  Group 3 consists of mCSCC patients who received cemiplimab 350 mg as an IV infusion over 
30 minutes Q3W. 
•  Group 6 consists of both mCSCC and laCSCC patients who are receiving cemiplimab 350 mg as 
an IV infusion over 30 minutes Q3W.  
The primary objective of this study was to estimate the clinical benefit of cemiplimab monotherapy for 
patients with mCSCC treated with 3 mg/kg Q2W (Group 1), laCSCC treated with 3 mg/kg Q2W 
(Group 2), or mCSCC treated with 350 mg Q3W (Group 3), as measured by the objective response 
rate (ORR) according to independent central review (ICR) in each group. For Group 6, the primary 
objective was to provide additional efficacy and safety data for cemiplimab monotherapy in patients 
with advanced CSCC (metastatic [nodal or distant] or locally advanced) treated with cemiplimab 
350 mg Q3W.   
The secondary objectives for all groups included the following: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To estimate the ORR according to investigator review 
To estimate the duration of response (DOR) and progression-free survival (PFS) by central and 
investigator review and overall survival (OS) 
To estimate the complete response (CR) rate by ICR 
To assess the safety and tolerability of cemiplimab 
To assess the PK of cemiplimab  
To assess the immunogenicity of cemiplimab  
For Groups 1 to 3 only: To assess the impact of cemiplimab on quality of life (QoL) using European 
Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-
C30)  
For Group 6 only: To assess relationships between PD-L1 status (by IHC) and efficacy measures (ORR, 
DOR, PFS).  
Methods 
Study Participants  
Inclusion Criteria 
A patient must have met the following criteria to be eligible for inclusion in the study: 
1.  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of invasive CSCC. 
Notes on tumor primary site: Patients whose primary site of squamous cell carcinoma was the dry 
red lip (vermillion) were not eligible. Patients with tumors arising on the cutaneous hair bearing 
Assessment report  
EMA/665912/2022 
Page 12/128 
 
 
 
 
 
(nonglabrous) lip with extension onto dry red lip (vermillion) may have been eligible after 
communication with and approval from medical monitor.  
Patients for whom the primary site of squamous cell carcinoma was the anogenital area (penis, 
scrotum, and perianal region) were not eligible. Patients for whom the primary site was nose were only 
eligible if the investigator was able to establish unambiguously that the primary site was the skin, not 
nasal mucosa with outward extension to skin.  
Notes on tumor histology: Patients with mixed histologies (eg, sarcomatoid, adenosquamous) 
generally were not eligible. Patients with mixed histology in which the predominant histology was 
invasive CSCC (with only a minimal component of mixed histology) may have been eligible, after 
communication with and approval from medical monitor. 
2.  At least 1 lesion that was measurable by study criteria. If a previously radiated lesion was to 
be followed as a target lesion, progression must have been confirmed by biopsy after radiation 
therapy. Previously radiated lesions may have been followed as non-target lesions if there was 
at least 1 other measurable target lesion. 
For patients with metastatic (nodal or distant) CSCC: There had to be at least 1 baseline 
measurable lesion ≥10 mm in maximal diameter (1.5 cm for lymph nodes) according to RECIST 1.1 
(Appendix 1 of the study protocol [Appendix 1.1]) 
Note: In the case of patients with metastatic disease that did not meet target lesion criteria by RECIST 
1.1 (eg, bone only lesions, perineural disease; Appendix 1 of the study protocol [Appendix 1.1]) and 
with externally visible CSCC target lesion(s), Appendix 2 of the study protocol (Appendix 1.1) may 
have been used, in which bi-dimensional measurements were required (at baseline, perpendicular 
diameters must both be ≥10 mm). The patient would then have been enrolled with the plan to 
measure externally visible target lesion(s) by photography with bi-dimensional measurements; the 
metastatic lesions not measurable by RECIST 1.1 criteria would have been followed as non-target 
lesions on scans. 
For patients with laCSCC: There must have been at least 1 measurable baseline lesion in which the 
longest diameter and the perpendicular diameter were both ≥10 mm if followed by digital medical 
photography (Appendix 2 of the study protocol [Appendix 1.1]). Non-measurable disease was defined 
as either unidimensionally measurable lesions, tumors with margins that were not clearly defined, or 
lesions with maximum perpendicular diameters less than 10 mm. Patients without measurable disease 
at baseline were not eligible for the study. 
3.  ECOG performance status ≤1 (ECOG PS 1 definition: Restricted in physically strenuous activity 
but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature, eg, light house work, 
office work; Appendix 7 of the study protocol [Appendix 1.1]). Note: Patients with ECOG PS >1 
were ineligible. 
4.  ≥18 years old. 
5.  Hepatic function: 
a. Total bilirubin ≤1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN); if liver metastases ≤3 × ULN). Patients 
with Gilbert’s Disease and total bilirubin up to 3 × ULN may have been eligible after 
communication with and approval from the medical monitor. 
b. Transaminases ≤3 × ULN (or ≤5.0 × ULN, if liver metastases). 
c. ALP ≤2.5 × ULN (or ≤5.0 × ULN, if liver or bone metastases). 
Assessment report  
EMA/665912/2022 
Page 13/128 
 
 
 
 
 
Note for patients with hepatic metastases: If transaminase levels (AST and/or ALT) were >3 × 
but ≤5 × ULN, total bilirubin was to be ≤1.5 × ULN. If total bilirubin was >1.5 × but ≤3 × ULN, both 
transaminases (AST and ALT) were to be ≤3 × ULN. 
6.  Renal function: Serum creatinine ≤1.5 × ULN or estimated creatinine clearance >30 mL/min. 
7.  Bone marrow function: 
a. Hemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dL. 
b. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.5 × 109/L. 
c. Platelet count ≥75 × 109/L. 
8.  Ability to provide signed informed consent. 
9.  Ability and willingness to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans, laboratory tests, and 
other study-related procedures. 
10. Anticipated life expectancy >12 weeks. 
11. Patients with laCSCC: Surgery was deemed contraindicated in the opinion of a Mohs 
dermatologic surgeon, a head and neck surgeon, or plastic surgeon. A copy of the surgeon’s 
consultation note from a clinical visit within 60 days of enrollment was submitted. 
Acceptable contraindications in the surgeon’s note included the following: 
•  CSCC that recurred in the same location after 2 or more surgical procedures and 
• 
curative resection was deemed unlikely. 
•  CSCCs with significant local invasion that precluded complete resection. 
•  CSCCs in anatomically challenging locations for which surgery may have resulted in 
severe disfigurement or dysfunction (eg, removal of all or part of a facial structure, 
such as nose, ear, or eye; or requirement for limb amputation). 
•  Other conditions deemed to be contraindicating for surgery were discussed with the 
medical monitor before enrolling the patient. 
12. Patients with laCSCC: Patients were deemed as not appropriate for radiation therapy. 
Specifically, patients met at least 1 of the following criteria: 
a. A patient previously received radiation therapy for CSCC, such that further radiation therapy 
exceeded the threshold of acceptable cumulative dose, per the radiation oncologist. A copy of 
the radiation oncologist’s consultation note, from a clinical visit within 60 days of enrollment, 
was to be submitted.  
b. Judgment of radiation oncologist that such tumor was unlikely to respond to therapy. A copy 
of the radiation oncologist’s consultation note, from a clinical visit within 60 days of enrollment, 
was to be submitted. 
c. A clinic note from the investigator indicating that an individualized benefit:risk assessment 
was performed by a multidisciplinary team (consisting of, at minimum, a radiation oncologist, 
and either a medical oncologist with expertise in cutaneous malignancies or a dermato-
oncologist, or a head and neck surgeon) within 60 days prior to enrollment in the proposed 
study, and the radiation therapy was deemed to be contraindicated. 
Assessment report  
EMA/665912/2022 
Page 14/128 
 
 
 
 
 
Acceptable contraindications to radiation therapy in the investigator’s note for patients 
who had not received any prior radiation included the following: 
• CSCCs in anatomically challenging locations for which radiation therapy would be 
associated with unacceptable toxicity risk in the context of the patient’s overall medical 
condition in the opinion of the multidisciplinary team (eg, a neck tumor for which 
radiation therapy would have resulted in potential need for a percutaneous 
gastrostomy tube). A copy of the investigator’s consultation note documenting the 
multidisciplinary assessment was to be submitted. 
• Other conditions deemed to be contraindicating for radiation therapy were discussed 
with the medical monitor before enrolling the patient. 
13. Groups 1, 2 and 3: All patients in either group consented to provide archived or newly obtained 
tumor material (either FFPE block or 10 unstained or stained slides) for central pathology 
review for confirmation of diagnosis of CSCC. This material was received by the sponsor prior 
to enrollment. 
14. Group 2 only (laCSCC patients): Patients consented to undergo biopsies of externally visible 
CSCC lesions at baseline, cycle 1 day 29 (±3 business days), at time of tumor progression, and 
at other time points that were clinically indicated in the opinion of the investigator. 
15. Patients with laCSCC: An investigator note which stated that the natural history of the patient’s 
advanced CSCC would likely be life-threatening within 3 years with currently available 
management options outside of a clinical study or cemiplimab. 
16. Group 6 only: Patients had to consent to undergo biopsies of CSCC lesions at baseline (and at 
time of tumor progression, if possible), unless the investigator communicated to the medical 
monitor that there was unacceptable safety risk associated with tumor biopsy in a particular 
patient, and at other time points that might be clinically indicated in the opinion of the 
investigator. 
Exclusion Criteria 
A patient who met any of the following criteria was excluded from the study: 
1.  Ongoing or recent (within 5 years) evidence of significant autoimmune disease that required 
treatment with systemic immunosuppressive treatments, which may suggest risk for irAEs. The 
following were not exclusionary: vitiligo, childhood asthma that had resolved, type 1 diabetes, 
residual hypothyroidism that required only hormone replacement, or psoriasis that did not 
require systemic treatment. 
2.  Prior treatment with an agent that blocks the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. 
3.  Prior treatment with other immune modulating agents that was (a) within fewer than 
1.  4 weeks (28 days) prior to the first dose of cemiplimab, or (b) associated with immune-related 
AEs that were grade ≥1 within 90 days prior to the first dose of cemiplimab, or (c) associated 
with toxicity that resulted in discontinuation of the immune-modulating agent. Examples of 
immune modulating agents included therapeutic anticancer vaccines, cytokine treatments 
(other than G-CSF or erythropoietin), or agents that target cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4, 
4-1BB (CD137), PI 3-K-delta, or OX-40. 
4.  Untreated brain metastasis(es) that were considered active. (Note: patients with brain 
involvement of CSCC due to direct extension of invading tumor, rather than metastasis, were 
Assessment report  
EMA/665912/2022 
Page 15/128 
 
 
 
 
allowed to enroll if they did not require greater than 10 mg prednisone daily, after discussion 
and approval of the medical monitor). Patients with previously treated brain metastases could 
participate provided that the lesion(s) was (were) stable (without evidence of progression for 
at least 6 weeks on imaging obtained in the screening period), and there was no evidence of 
new or enlarging brain metastases, and the patient did not require any immunosuppressive 
doses of systemic corticosteroids for management of brain metastasis(es) within 4 weeks of 
first dose of cemiplimab. 
5.  Immunosuppressive corticosteroid doses (>10 mg prednisone daily or equivalent) within 4 
weeks prior to the first dose of cemiplimab. 
Note: Patients who required brief course of steroids (eg, as prophylaxis for imaging studies due to 
hypersensitivity to contrast agents) were not excluded. 
6.  Active infection requiring therapy, including known infection with human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV), or active infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV). 
7.  History of pneumonitis within the last 5 years. 
8.  Grade ≥3 hypercalcemia at time of enrollment. 
9.  Any systemic anticancer treatment (chemotherapy, targeted systemic therapy, photodynamic 
therapy), investigational or standard of care, within 30 days of the initial administration of 
cemiplimab or planned to occur during the study period (patients receiving bisphosphonates or 
denosumab were not excluded), radiation therapy within 14 days of initial administration of 
cemiplimab or planned to occur during the study period. 
Note: For patients with multiple CSCCs at baseline that were not designated by the investigator as 
target lesions, treatment of these non-target CSCCs with surgery could be permitted but must have 
been discussed with the medical monitor prior to any surgical procedure. 
10. History of documented allergic reactions or acute hypersensitivity reaction attributed to 
antibody treatments. 
11. Patients with allergy or hypersensitivity to cemiplimab or to any of the excipients were 
excluded. 
12. Breastfeeding. 
13. Positive serum pregnancy test (a false positive pregnancy test, if demonstrated by serial 
measurements and negative ultrasound, was not exclusionary, upon communication with and 
approval from the medical monitor). 
14. Concurrent malignancy other than CSCC and/or history of malignancy other than CSCC within 
3 years of date of first planned dose of cemiplimab, except for tumors with negligible risk of 
metastasis or death, such as adequately treated BCC of the skin, carcinoma in situ of the 
cervix, or ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast; low-risk early stage prostate adenocarcinoma 
(T1-T2aN0M0 and Gleason score ≤6 and prostate specific antigen [PSA] ≤10 ng/mL) for which 
the management plan was active surveillance; or prostate adenocarcinoma with biochemical-
only recurrence with documented PSA doubling time of >12 months for which the management 
plan was active surveillance (D'Amico, 2005) (Pham, 2016). Patients with hematologic 
malignancies (eg, chronic lymphocytic leukemia) were excluded. 
15. Any acute or chronic psychiatric problems that, in the opinion of the investigator, made the 
patient ineligible for participation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/665912/2022 
Page 16/128 
 
 
 
 
16. Continued sexual activity in men** or women of childbearing potential (WOCBP)* who were 
unwilling to practice highly effective contraception prior to the initial dose/start of the first 
dose, during the study and until 6 months after the last dose. 
Highly effective contraceptive measures include: 
a. stable use of oral contraceptives such as combined estrogen and progestogen and 
progestogen only hormonal contraception or other prescription pharmaceutical contraceptives 
for 2 or more menstrual cycles prior to screening. 
b. intrauterine device (IUD); intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS); 
c. bilateral tubal ligation; 
d. vasectomized partner (provided that the male vasectomized partner was the sole sexual 
partner of the WOCBP study participant and that the vasectomized partner had obtained 
medical assessment of surgical success for the procedure) 
e. and/or sexual abstinence†, ‡. 
* WOCBP was defined as women who were fertile following menarche until becoming postmenopausal, 
unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods included hysterectomy, bilateral 
salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy. 
** A postmenopausal state was defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical 
cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range could be used to 
confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement 
therapy. However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement was 
insufficient to determine the occurrence of a postmenopausal state. The above definitions are 
according to Clinical Trial Facilitation Group (CTFG) guidance. Pregnancy testing and contraception 
were not required for women with documented hysterectomy or tubal ligation. 
† Sexual abstinence was considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drugs. The reliability 
of sexual abstinence had to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the 
preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. 
‡ Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus 
interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea method (LAM) were not acceptable 
methods of contraception. Female condom and male condom could not be used together. 
17. Patients with a history of solid organ transplant (patients with prior corneal transplant[s] may 
have been allowed to enroll after discussion with and approval from the medical monitor). 
18. Prior treatment with a BRAF inhibitor.  
19. Any medical co-morbidity, physical examination finding, or metabolic dysfunction, or clinical 
laboratory abnormality that, in the opinion of the investigator, rendered the patient unsuitable 
for participation in a clinical trial due to high safety risks and/or potential to affect 
interpretation of results of the study. 
Note in clarification: The investigator must have contacted the sponsor’s medical monitor regarding 
any patients that the investigator felt could not provide the required baseline tumor biopsies. 
20. Inability to undergo any contrast-enhanced radiologic response assessment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/665912/2022 
Page 17/128 
 
 
 
 
Notes regarding imaging options: A patient who was unable to undergo computed tomography 
(CT) with iodinated contrast (eg, due to contrast allergy) was not excluded if his/her disease could be 
measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadolinium. A patient who was unable to 
undergo MRI with gadolinium was not excluded if his/her disease could be measured by CT scan with 
contrast. 
Note regarding laCSCC patients only: In selected cases, a patient who was unable to undergo any 
contrast enhanced radiographic imaging (neither CT with iodinated contrast nor MRI with gadolinium) 
may have been eligible if the patient’s disease could be comprehensively assessed with digital medical 
photography, after communication with and approval from medical monitor. 
Assessment comment 
As discussed in the initial approval the inclusion and exclusion criteria seem to represent the patient 
population afflicted by either locally advanced or metastatic CSCC. The same inclusion/exclusion were 
applied to Group 6. 
Treatments 
Cemiplimab was supplied as a liquid in sterile, single-use vials. Each vial of cemiplimab contained a 
concentration of 50 mg/mL for IV infusion, 
Instructions on dose preparation were provided in the pharmacy manual. 
Cemiplimab was administered in an outpatient setting as a 30-minute (±10 minutes) IV infusion. 
Longer infusion durations were acceptable if interruption was required or if a patient had a previous 
infusion reaction during treatment. Patient doses in Groups 1 and 2 depended on their individual body 
weight (3 mg/kg). The dose of cemiplimab was adjusted each cycle for changes in body weight of 
≥10%. Dose adjustments for changes in body weight of <10% were at the discretion of the 
investigator. Groups 3 and 6 received a fixed dose of cemiplimab. 
Objectives 
Primary Efficacy Analyses 
Best overall response (BOR: CR/PR/SD/PD/NE) per ICR was summarized by group: 
•  NE response included the missing and unknown responses. 
•  CR/PR was confirmed by repeated assessments no less than 4 weeks apart. 
•  SD criterion was met at least once for a minimum duration of 39 days 
(7 days/week * 6 weeks–3 days) after the first dose date. 
Patients with the BOR of NE were considered as nonresponders in the calculation of ORR.  The primary 
analysis of efficacy was based on the exact binomial CI approach of ORR.  The 2-sided 95% exact 
binomial CIs were derived using the Clopper-Pearson method (Clopper, 1934). If the lower limit of 
95% CI of observed ORRs excluded 15% for Group 1 (mCSCC cemiplimab 3 mg/kg Q2W IV) or 
Group 3 (mCSCC cemiplimab 350 mg Q3W IV) or excluded 25% for Group 2 (laCSCC cemiplimab IV 
3 mg/kg Q2W), the study drug was deemed effective for that group. 
In addition, ORR along with 2-sided 95% exact binomial CIs for all patients treated with cemiplimab 
was presented. 
Assessment report  
EMA/665912/2022 
Page 18/128 
 
 
 
 
 
Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
•  ORR was derived from the objective response that was based on investigator review and was 
analyzed similarly as the primary efficacy variable. 
•  DOR was summarized by estimated median using the Kaplan-Meier approach.  Observed DOR 
was summarized by range. 
•  TTR was displayed using swimmer plots and summarized by descriptive statistics. 
•  PFS was summarized by median (if observed) and PFS rate at milestone time points (4, 6, 8, 
12, and 16 months, etc), and displayed by the Kaplan-Meier approach. 
•  OS was summarized by median (if observed) and OS rate at milestone time points (4, 6, 8, 12, 
and 16 months, etc) and displayed by the Kaplan-Meier approach.  A variant of OS defined by 
censoring patients at the start date of subsequent therapy was summarized and displayed by 
Kaplan-Meier approach as a sensitivity analysis. 
•  Depth of tumor response was displayed using waterfall plots and swimmer plots and 
summarized by descriptive statistics. 
•  CR rate with 95% CI was estimated using the Clopper-Pearson method.  Absence of residual 
CSCC in biopsy samples (obtained post-response) from patients with laCSCC achieving a 
clinical response to cemiplimab, as measured by independent central pathological review, was 
summarized descriptively. 
•  Disease control rate (DCR) was determined by the proportion of patients with BOR of CR, PR, 
or SD. 
•  Durable disease control rate (dDCR) was defined as the proportion of patients best overall 
response of CR, PR, or SD without progression for at least 16 weeks (allowing tumor 
assessment made 1 week earlier than week 16). 
Interim Analysis for Group 6 
Per the sample size calculation, 167 patients in total were planned for Group 6. A pre-specified interim 
analysis of the first 84 patients in Group 6 was performed after they had the opportunity to be followed 
up for a minimum of 28 weeks (27 weeks for 3 tumor assessments + 1-week assessment window). 
This interim analysis was to include a minimum of 20 locally advanced CSCC patients.  
Assessment comment 
The objectives of the study are endorsed and considered suitable for an uncontrolled study. In the initial 
application PD-L1 characterization of the entire population was of particular interest. The MAH was asked 
to investigate the relationship between PD-L1 expression and efficacy post-approval.  
This will be discussed in other sections of this AR. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint for this study was overall response based on independent central review 
evaluation at each time point at which response assessment occurs using the RECIST version 1.1 
(Module 5.3.5.2 R2810-ONC-1540 Group 6 Interim CSR Appendix 1.1 [Appendix 1]) or the composite 
response criteria (Module 5.3.5.2 R2810-ONC-1540 Group 6 Interim CSR Appendix 1.1 [Appendix 2]). 
Assessment report  
EMA/665912/2022 
Page 19/128 
 
 
 
 
Best overall response (BOR) was determined based on all response assessments until the data cutoff 
date (11 Oct 2020 for Groups 1 to 3 and 19 Apr 2021 for Group 6).  Best overall response of complete 
response (CR) or PR had to be confirmed by consecutive evaluations of overall response of CR or PR at 
time points at least 4 weeks apart.  Best overall response of stable disease (SD) must have met the 
response SD criteria at least once ≥39 days (6 weeks*7 days/week -3 days) after start of study 
treatment.  Best overall response of (early) PD did not require confirmation using the RECIST or the 
composite response criteria.  The BOR for patients who did not have any post-baseline tumor 
assessment was NE. 
Objective response rate was determined by the proportion of patients with BOR of CR or PR in the FAS 
by group.  Patients with BOR of NE were considered as not reaching an objective response of CR or PR.  
Not evaluable response included missing and unknown tumor response. Non-CR/Non-PD is for patients 
with non-measurable disease only. 
Analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint are detailed in the SAP for Study 1540 (Module 5.3.5.2 
R2810-ONC-1540 Group 6 Interim CSR Appendix 1.9.1 [Section 5.8.1]). 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
The secondary endpoints were the following: 
•  ORR based on investigator-assessed evaluation  
•  DOR by independent central review and investigator review 
•  PFS by central review and investigator review 
•  OS 
•  CR rate by independent central review 
•  TTR by independent central review and by investigator assessment  
•  DCR 
•  DDCR 
• 
For Group 6 only: assessment of the relationship between PD-L1 status (by IHC) and efficacy 
measures (ORR, DOR, PFS) 
•  Change in scores of patient-reported outcomes on EORTC QLQ-C30 (except Group 6) 
Analyses of the secondary efficacy endpoints are detailed in the SAP for Study 1540 (Module 5.3.5.2 
R2810-ONC-1540 Group 6 Interim CSR Appendix 1.9.1 [Section 5.8.2]).   
Assessment comment 
The primary endpoint was endorsed in the initial MAA application. Secondary endpoints included ORR 
assessed by the investigators, DOR, PFS and CR rate. The secondary endpoints were also endorsed but 
only considered exploratory since no multiplicity corrections were made.   
Sample size 
For Group 6, 150 patients were required to provide at least 85% power to reject a null hypothesis of 
an ORR of 28% at a 2-sided significance level of no more than 5% if the true ORR is 40%. The sample 
size was further increased by 10% to account for patients who withdrew prematurely from the study. 
Hence, the total planned sample size is approximately 167 patients for Group 6. The ORR of 28% for 
Assessment report  
EMA/665912/2022

Group 6 will be excluded using the lower limit of 95% exact CI if the observed ORR is 35.3% or more, 
ie, the ORR for Group 6 was significantly different from 28% (Table 10). 
In Group 6, enrollment of metastatic CSCC patients was capped at 133 patients to allow for at least 34 
patients with locally advanced CSCC to be enrolled. This mirrors the real-world distribution of 
metastatic (80%) and locally advanced (20%) patients with CSCC described in retrospective study of 
advanced CSCC in the US Oncology Network (Cowey, manuscript in preparation). Appendix 10 of the 
study protocol (Appendix 1.1) presents reference tables for Group 6 subgroup analyses. However, the 
primary analysis for Group 6 is based on all advanced CSCC patients, both metastatic and locally 
advanced. These subgroup analyses are descriptive only. 
Assessment comment 
The sample size for Group 6 was previously endorsed in relation to the assessment of the protocol.

Statistical methods 
The efficacy analysis is based on the full analysis set (FAS). The FAS for Groups 1 to 3 included all 
patients who passed screening and were deemed to be eligible for this study.  The FAS for the interim 
analysis of Group 6 (mCSCC + laCSCC) included all enrolled patients who had passed screening, were 
eligible for the study, and who had the potential for 3 tumor assessments (28 weeks) on study.

Change to Study Conduct Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic 
Portions of this study were conducted during the “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID-19) pandemic. 
The sponsor made a decision that this study would continue based on the assessment that the study 
Assessment report  
EMA/665912/2022

could be conducted without potentially jeopardizing patient safety, data integrity, or compliance with 
recent Regulatory Guidance. 
In light of the public health emergency related to COVID-19, the continuity of clinical study conduct 
and oversight required implementation of temporary or alternative mechanisms. 
Formal documentation of deviations to Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) or other controlled 
procedural documents can be found in Appendix 1.13. 
Other mechanisms employed included: 
Phone contact, virtual visits, telemedicine visits, online meetings, non-invasive remote monitoring 
devices, use of local clinic or laboratory locations, and home visits by skilled staff. 
Additionally, no waivers to deviate from protocol enrollment criteria due to COVID-19 were granted. All 
temporary mechanisms utilized, and deviations from planned study procedures were documented as 
being related to COVID-19 and remained in effect only for the duration of the public health emergency. 
Assessment comment 
Previous protocol amendments have been assessed in relation to the initial MAA. The latest change to 
the protocol was made in 2019 and introduced Group 6 as requested by the CHMP. The additional 
changes are considered minor.

Assessment comment 
In total 10 patients had major protocol deviations. However, no clear pattern is observed. The individual 
protocol deviations will not impact the overall result, even if these patients were excluded. 
Baseline data 
Groups 1 to 3 
Overall, baseline demographic characteristics were similar among all groups.  The majority of patients 
were white (96.9% [187/193]) and/or male (83.4% [161/193]) (Module 5.3.5.2 Study 1540 Group 6 
Interim CSR Table 22).  The majority of the patients were 65 years of age or older (74.6% [144/193]), 
with a mean (standard deviation) age of 71.1 (11.35) years. Patient demographics were consistent 
with the expected population of patients with advanced CSCC. 
In Groups 1 to 3, most patients 67.9% (131/193) had a primary cancer site of head and neck (Module 
5.3.5.2 Study 1540 Group 6 Interim CSR Post-text Listing 16.2.4.2 and Post-text Table 14.1.2.2f).  
Group 6 (Interim Analysis) 
All patients were White and a majority of patients were male (79.8% [67/84]) (Module 5.3.5.2 Study 
1540 Group 6 Interim CSR Table 23).  The majority of the patients were 75 years of age or older 
(54.8% [46/84]), with a mean (standard deviation) age of 74.1 (11.07) years.  Patient demographics 
were consistent with the expected population of patients with advanced CSCC. 
In Group 6, 64.3% (54/84) of patients had metastatic disease and 35.7% (30/84) of patients had 
locally advanced disease.  In Group 6 most patients 65.5% (55/84) had a primary cancer site of head

and neck (Module 5.3.5.2 Study 1540 Group 6 Interim CSR Post text Listing 16.2.4.2.g6 and Post-text 
Table 14.1.2.2f.g6). 
Previous Anticancer Therapy 
A greater percentage of patients in Group 1 (55.9% [33/59]) and Group 3 (35.7% [20/56]) received 
prior cancer-related systemic therapy than those in Group 2 (15.4% [12/78]) (Module 5.3.5.2 Study 
1540 Group 6 Interim  CSR Table 26).  The most common prior systemic therapies reported in each 
group were platinum-based antineoplastic agents; (35.6% [21/59] in Group 1, 9.0% [7/78] in 
Group 2, and 32.1% [18/56] in Group 3) (Module 5.3.5.2 Study 1540 Group 6 Interim CSR Post-text 
Table  14.1.3.2f).  Prior mAb therapy was received by 9.3% (18/193) of all patients ; the mAb was 
cetuximab in each case (Module 5.3.5.2 Study 1540 Group 6 Interim  CSR Post-text Listing 16.2.4.4). 
In Group 6, there was 1 patient that received prior cancer related systemic therapy.  This patient 
received the mAb cetuximab (Module 5.3.5.2 Study 1540 Group 6 Interim CSR Post-text 
Listing 16.2.4.4fg6).  
Previous Surgeries and Radiotherapy 
Groups 1 to 3 
The majority of patients in Group 1, Group 2, and Group 3 had at least 1 prior cancer-related surgery 
(88.6% [171/193]) (Module 5.3.5.2 Study 1540 Group 6 Interim CSR Post-text Table 14.1.3.3f).  The 
median number of prior cancer-related surgeries was 5 (range: 1 to 28).  
The majority of patients had prior cancer-related radiotherapy (67.9% [131/193]) (Module 5.3.5.2 
Study 1540 Group 6 Interim CSR Post-text Table 14.1.3.4f).  More patients in Groups 1 and 3 had 
prior cancer-related radiotherapy compared to Group 2, which was expected because patients in these 
groups had metastatic cancer. 
Group 6 (Interim Analysis) 
The majority of patients in scope of the interim analysis for Group 6 had at least 1 prior cancer-related 
surgery (84.5% [71/84]) (Module 5.3.5.2 Study 1540 Group 6 Interim CSR Post-text 
Table 14.1.3.3f.g6).  The median number of prior cancer-related surgeries was 4 (range: 2 to 6).  
The majority of patients had prior cancer-related radiotherapy (52.4% [44/84]).

Outcomes and estimation 
Groups 1 to 3 
The ORR by ICR, according to intention-to-treat (ITT) for patients in Group 1 was 50.8% (95% CI: 
37.5 to 64.1), Group 2 was 44.9% (95% CI: 33.6 to 56.6), and Group 3 was 46.4% (95% CI: 33.0% 
to 60.3%) (Table 3).  Among 193 patients in the pooled FAS, ORR was 47.2% (95% CI: 39.9 to 54.4). 
The prespecified threshold for clinically meaningful ORR was defined as the lower bound of the 95% 
CIs to be analyzed separately for each group.  The prespecified efficacy thresholds were exceeded (ie, 
the lower bounds of the 95% CIs) exceeded 15% for Groups 1 and 3 and exceeded 25% for Group 2) 
(Module 5.3.5.2 Study 1540 Group 6 Interim CSR Section 8.3.1). 
Clinically meaningful treatment effect (also described by durable DCR) as presented in Table 3 was 
61.0% (95% CI: 47.4 to 73.5) for Group 1, 62.8% (95% CI: 51.1 to 73.5) for Group 2, and 57.1% 
(95% CI: 43.2 to 70.3) for Group 3.  The durable DCR for the pooled FAS of Groups 1, 2, and 3 was 
60.6% (95% CI: 53.3 to 67.6) (Table 3).

Data cutoff as of 11 Oct 2020. 
Waterfall plot displays the best percentage change in the sum of target lesion diameters during study period from baseline, based on radiologic imaging.  Lesion measurements after 
progression are excluded.  Patients with new lesions or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions are considered as PD (red bars) regardless of target lesion response.  Patients 
with a single assessment with ≥30% reduction of target lesion(s) are considered SD (blue bars) if there is not confirmatory assessment to establish PR.  One patient is NR; this 
patient had radiologic and photographic data and was, therefore, reviewed by ICRC and assessed as NE (yellow bar).  Increase in sum of target lesion diameters greater than 100% 
is reported as 100%.

measurements  after  progression  are  excluded.    Eight  of  35  patients  with  objective  response  are  not  shown  in  this  plot  because  the  response  assessments  per  ICRC  included 
consideration of radiologic results.  Patients with a single assessment with ≥50% reduction of target lesion(s) are considered SD (blue bars) if there is not confirmatory assessment 
to establish PR or if the ICRC adjudicated best overall response status of SD after reviewing radiologic data for the case.  Patients with 100% reduction of target lesions but without 
pathologic confirmation of histologic negativity (CR) were considered to have PR.  Increase in sum of product of the skin target lesion diameters greater than 100% is reported as 
100%.

Group 6 (Interim Analysis) 
Two of the 84 patients treated with cemiplimab in Group 6 in scope of the pre-specified Group 6 
interim analysis were enrolled but did not receive any cemiplimab dose. Although these patients 
appeared to meet eligibility at time of enrollment, both patients were unable to receive study 
treatment because of AEs which, had they occurred prior to study enrollment, would have rendered 
both patients ineligible for the study: One patient presented tachycardia on day 1 of cycle 1 prior to 
cemiplimab infusion; the patient progressed rapidly and died; The other patient experienced worsening 
health status (ECOG PS of 3) after enrollment; the patient presented a SAE of grade 3 hypercalcemia, 
progressed rapidly and died. These AEs occurred after enrollment but prior to first planned dose of 
study drug (Module 5.3.5.2 Group 6 Interim CSR Section 8.3.3.2).  
Therefore, the efficacy evaluation presented in Table 5 represents data collected for the first 
82 patients. For the 82 patients who received at least 1 dose of cemiplimab in Group 6, ORR was 
40.2% (95% CI: 29.6 to 51.7).

Data cutoff as of 19 Apr 2021 
Waterfall plot displays the best percentage change in the sum of target lesion diameters during study period from baseline, based on radiologic imaging.  Lesion measurements after 
progression are excluded.  Patients with new lesions or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions were considered as PD (red bars) regardless of target lesion response.  Patients 
with a single assessment with ≥30% reduction of target lesion(s) are considered SD (blue bars) if there is not confirmatory assessment to establish PR.  One patient is NE (yellow 
bar); this patient had both radiologic and photographic data and was assessed by the ICRC as NE, due to surgical debridement of target lesion after initial imaging evidence of 
response but prior to confirmatory imaging.   Increase in sum of target lesion diameters greater than 100% was reported as 100%.  Patients with no measurable target lesions or with 
baseline target lesion measurements but no post-baseline tumor assessments were not included.

Assessment comment 
The updated ORR and DOR from Groups 1-3 continue to show clinically meaningful benefit, and the ORR 
and DOR observed in Group 6 are in line with Group 1-3. The MAH has excluded two patients from the 
efficacy evaluation in Group 6. Both patients didn’t receive any treatment with cemiplimab. Thus, their 
exclusion is endorsed. 
Subgroup Analyses 
Groups 1 to 3 
Exploratory subgroup analyses demonstrated antitumor activity of cemiplimab in all subgroups in 
Groups 1 to 3. However, there was a numerical difference in ORR related to prior systemic therapy.  
The ORR in patients within Groups 1 to 3 who had received prior systemic anticancer therapy was 
41.5% (27/65; 95% CI: 29.4% to 54.4%) and, in those who had not received prior systemic 
anticancer therapy, ORR was 50.0% (64/128; 95% CI: 41.0% to 59.0%) (Module 5.3.5.2 Study 1540 
Group 6 Interim CSR Post-text Table 14.2.1.1.s6). 
Group 6 (Interim Analysis) 
Exploratory subgroup analyses demonstrated antitumor activity of cemiplimab in all clinically relevant 
subgroups in Group 6. These subgroup results should be interpreted with caution due to the small 
patient numbers in some of the subgroups.  The ORR in mCSCC patients in Group 6 (n=54) was 42.6% 
(23/54; 95% CI: 29.2%, 56.8%) and the ORR in laCSCC patients in Group 6 (n=30) was 33.3% 
(10/30; 95% CI: 17.3%, 52.8%); (Module 5.3.5.2 Study 1540 Group 6 Interim CSR Post-text Table 
14.2.1.1.s11.g6).   
Secondary Endpoints 
Objective Response Rate and Duration of Response by Investigator Assessment 
Groups 1 to 3 
Investigator-assessed ORR was prospectively defined as a secondary endpoint.  These data are 
considered supportive to those obtained by ICR and relevant to clinical practice, where treatment 
decisions are guided by physician assessment and not central review.  Point estimates of ORR per 
investigator assessments in Groups 1, 2, 3, and overall were 50.8% (95% CI: 37.5 to 64.1), 56.4% 
(95% CI: 44.7 to 67.6), 55.4% (95% CI: 41.5 to 68.7) and 54.4% (95% CI: 47.1 to 61.6), 
respectively (Module 5.3.5.2 Study 1540 Group 6 Interim  CSR Post-text Table 14.2.1.2f). 
Group 6 (Interim Analysis) 
Point estimates of ORR per investigator assessments for the interim analysis of Group 6 was 52.4% 
(95% CI: 41.1% to 63.6%) (Module 5.3.5.2 Study 1540 Group 6 Interim  CSR Post-text 
Table 14.2.1.2af.g6) for the 82 patients who had received at least 1 dose of cemiplimab and 51.2% 
(95% CI: 40.0% to 62.3%) (Module 5.3.5.2 Study 1540 Group 6 Interim CSR Post-text Table 
14.2.1.2f.g6) for all 84 patients in Group 6.

For all 193 patients in Groups 1, 2, and 3, the median duration of follow-up was approximately 15.74 
months (range: 0.6 to 43.2).  
The median PFS at the time of data cutoff per ICR, was 18.4 months for Group 1, 18.5 months for 
Group 2, and 21.7 months for Group 3 (Table 8 and Figure 9). The estimated event-free probability 
from baseline through 12 months was 53.0% (95% CI: 39.0% to 65.1%) for patients in Group 1, 
60.5% (95% CI: 47.5% to 71.3%) for patients in Group 2, and 52.4% (95% CI: 38.4% to 64.6%) for 
patients in Group 3.  For all 3 groups combined, the estimated event-free probability from baseline 
through 12 months was 55.8% (95% CI: 48.1% to 62.8%). 
The estimated event-free probability from baseline through 24 months was 43.1% (95% CI: 29.8% to 
55.8%) for patients in Group 1, 48.5% (95% CI: 35.1% to 60.7%) for patients in Group 2, and 48.4% 
(95% CI: 34.6% to 60.9%) for patients in Group 3.  For all 3 groups combined, the estimated 
event-free probability from baseline through 24 months was 46.9% (95% CI: 39.2 to 54.3).

Group 6 (Interim Analysis) 
The median duration of follow-up for the 82 patients who received cemiplimab was approximately 6.64 
months (range: 0.3 to 13.1). Per the SAP, PFS can only be calculated for patients treated with 
cemiplimab, so the 2 patients in Group 6 who were not dosed are not included. 
The median PFS at the time of data cutoff per independent central review, was 10.3 months for 
Group 6 (Table 9).  The estimated event-free probability from baseline through 6 months was 63.1% 
(95% CI: 51.2% to 72.8%) for patients in Group 6.   
Only 40.2% of patients had PFS events and therefore the KM estimate of PFS is not stable at the time 
of this interim analysis (Module 5.3.5.2 Study 1540 Group 6 Interim CSR Post-text Figure 
14.2.2.1.8.g6).

Group 6 (Interim Analysis) 
The median duration of follow-up for 82 patients was approximately 6.64 months (range: 0.3 to 13.1). 
Per the SAP, OS can only be calculated for patients treated with cemiplimab, so the 2 patients in Group 
6 who were not dosed are not included. Median OS was not reached in Group 6 at the time of the data 
cutoff. 
The estimated probability of survival from baseline through 6 months for patients in Group 6 who had 
received at least 1 dose of cemiplimab was 83.8% (95% CI: 73.7 to 90.3) (Table 11). The estimated 
probability of survival from baseline through 12 months for patients in Group 6 who had received at 
least 1 dose of cemiplimab was 67.7% (95% CI: 51.5 to 79.5) (Table 11). Only 24.4% of patients had 
OS events and therefore the KM estimate of OS is not stable at the time of this interim analysis 
(Module 5.3.5.2 Study 1540 Group 6 Interim Analysis CSR Post-text Figure 14.2.2.1.8.g6).

Complete Response Rate per Independent Central Review 
Groups 1 to 3 
For patients in Group 1, the CR rate was 20.3% (12/59; 95% CI: 11.0 to 32.8%) (Table 3). S 1-3 
For patients in Group 2, the CR rate was 12.8% (10/78; 95% CI: 6.3% to 22.3%) (Table 3).  
Complete response rate for Group 3 was 19.6% (11/56, 95% CI: 10.2% to 32.4%) (Table 3).   
For all 193 patients combined from Groups 1, 2, and 3, the CR rate was 17.1% (33/193; 95% CI: 
12.1% to 23.2%) (Table 3). As discussed in Section 4, CR rates for Group 1 to 3 patients have 
increased with longer follow up after the primary analyses for these groups. 
Observed median time to CR per ICR was 11.30 months (95% CI: 1.8 to 22.8) for the 3 groups, 11.09 
months (95%CI: 3.7 to 22.1) for Group 1, 10.48 months (95% CI: 1.8 to 14.8) for Group 2, and 12.65 
months (95%CI: 6.2 to 22.8) for Group 3 (Module 5.3.5.2 Study 1540 Interim Group 6 CSR Post-text 
Table 14.2.1.17f).

Complete response rate for the 82 patients who had received at least 1 dose of cemiplimab in Group 6 
was 6.1% (5/82, 95% CI: 2.0% to 13.7%) (Table 5).  Complete response rate for the first 84 patients 
in Group 6 was 6.0% (5/84, 95% CI: 2.0% to 13.3%) (Table 6).   
Given that median follow up in Group 6 is 6.64 months, and median time to CR was 11.3 months in 
Groups 1 to 3, the Group 6 CR rate will be re-assessed at future data cut.  
Time to Response per Independent Central Review 
Groups 1 to 3 
Combining the data for all 91 patients with confirmed CR or PR in Groups 1 to 3, the median observed 
TTR was 2.07 months (range: 1.7 to 22.8 months) (Module 5.3.5.2 Study 1540 Group 6 Interim CSR 
Table 45), which corresponds to the timing of the first response assessments, approximately 8 weeks 
(1.8 months) in Groups 1 and 2 , and approximately 9 weeks (2.1 months) in Group 3.  The observed 
TTR supplements evidence of the efficacy of cemiplimab in patients with advanced CSCC.  Details are 
provided in Module 5.3.5.2 Study 1540 Group 6 Interim CSR Section 8.4.5.1. 
Group 6 (Interim Analysis) 
For patients in Group 6 with confirmed CR or PR, median observed TTR was 2.10 months (range: 1.4 
to 6.2 months) (Module 5.3.5.2 Study 1540 Group 6 Interim CSR Table 46).  The observed median 
TTR corresponds to the timing of the first response assessments, approximately 9 weeks (2.1 months) 
in Group 6.  Details are provided in Module 5.3.5.2 Study 1540 Group 6 Interim CSR Section 8.4.5.2. 
Assessment comment 
The secondary endpoints are not controlled for multiplicity and the time-to-event endpoints should be 
interpreted with caution. Nonetheless, the results in Groups 1-3 continue to show clinical benefit and 
support the primary endpoint, and results from Group 6 are in line with Groups 1-3. Given the short 
follow-up in Group 6 any firm conclusions should be avoided. 
Ancillary analyses 
Groups 1 to 3 
Tumoral PD-L1 expression (TPS) was evaluated on an exploratory basis among advanced CSCC 
patients in Group 2.  PD-L1 expression in tumor cells by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in pretreatment 
tumor samples was done on an exploratory basis, without formal validation.  Pretreatment tumor 
samples were available for PD-L1 IHC testing in 48 of 78 patients in Group 2. 
The samples of the remaining 30 patients were excluded from PD-L1 analysis because the slides were 
expired (>6 months since slide cut date) or because there were an insufficient number of cells (<100 
viable cells) on the slide.  Table 12 presents centrally reviewed ORR data and PD-L1 TPS at different 
cutoffs.  Responses are noted at all PD-L1 cutoffs. Among 17 patients in the PD-L1 negative group 
(TPS <1%), ORR was 35.3% (6/17 patients). Combining data for all PD-L1 positive patients (TPS 
≥1%), ORR was 58.06% (18/31 patients). The ORR data demonstrate that PD-L1 is not a useful 
marker for selection of advanced CSCC patients for cemiplimab therapy.  Cemiplimab is active against 
advanced CSCC in all PD-L1 strata. 
In summary, there was no consistent association between baseline PD-L1 status and clinical response, 
suggesting that baseline PD-L1 testing will have little or no clinical utility in advanced CSCC.  Objective

Group 6 (Interim Analysis) 
Tumoral PD-L1 expression (TPS) was a secondary endpoint in Group 6.  Biomarker data are presented 
for PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC).  
Among the 84 patients in scope for the interim analysis in Group 6, a baseline tumor sample for PD-L1 
analysis was available for 40 patients.  Among 16 patients in the PD-L1 negative group (TPS <1%), 
ORR was 31.3% (5/16 patients).  In PD-L1 positive patients (TPS ≥1%), ORR was 37.5% (9/24 
patients) (Table 13). A breakdown of the data for positive patients (TPS ≥1%), showed an ORR of 
20.0% (1/5) for patients with TPS ≥1% and <5%, an ORR of 14.3% (1/7) for patients with TPS ≥5% 
and <50%, and an ORR of 58.3% (7/12) for patients with TPS ≥50% (Table 14). Overall, the ORR 
data demonstrated that PD-L1 is not a useful marker for selection of advanced CSCC patients for 
cemiplimab therapy.  Cemiplimab is active against advanced CSCC in all PD-L1 strata.  Group 6 results 
were consistent with results from Groups 1 to 3.

Assessment comment 
Approximately half of the 84 patients in scope of the interim analysis in Group 6 had an available baseline 
tumor sample. The numbers are small, but it can be reasonably concluded that efficacy of cemiplimab is 
not  predicted  by  PD-L1  expression  in  the  CSCC  clinical  setting.  This  supports  the  continued  use  of 
cemiplimab in all-comers in CSCC. 
Safety 
All patients who received at least 1 dose of cemiplimab in Study 1540 Groups 1, 2, 3 and 6 (interim 
analysis), Study 1423, Study 1676, Study 1620, and Study 1624 (excluding crossover cemiplimab 
treatment) are included in the analysis. Integrated databases by each pool are presented in Table 2   
and described below. 
•  Safety Pool 1 (CSCC population): All patients who received at least 1 dose of cemiplimab 
monotherapy in Study 1540 (Groups 1 to 3 and Group 6 [interim analysis]). This pool included 
275 patients. This is the primary pool for the analysis of safety of cemiplimab in patients with 
CSCC.  
•  Safety Pool 2 (cemiplimab monotherapy population): All patients (N=1198) who received at 
least 1 dose of cemiplimab as monotherapy in Study 1540 (Groups 1, 2, 3 and 6 [interim 
analysis], n=275), Study 1676 (n=300), Study 1423 (n=130), Study 1620 (n=138) and Study 
1624 (excluding crossover cemiplimab treatment, n=355). This pool is used to evaluate the 
frequency and characteristics of important risks of cemiplimab (imAEs and IRRs) and allows a 
broader assessment of the safety profile of cemiplimab monotherapy across solid tumor 
indications. 
The safety data from Study 1540 (Safety Pool 1) is presented side-by-side with integrated safety data 
from Study 1540 and 4 supportive studies (Safety Pool 2 [cemiplimab monotherapy]).  
Exposure 
Groups 1 to 3 
In Groups 1 to 3, 193 patients were treated with at least 1 dose of cemiplimab, including 137 patients 
treated with 3 mg/kg Q2W (59 patients in Group 1 and 78 patients in Group 2) and 56 patients with 
mCSCC treated with 350 mg Q3W (Group 3). 
The median duration of exposure was 51.1 weeks (range: 2.0 to 109.3 weeks) and the median number 
of doses administered was 18.0 (range: 1 to 48 doses) (Table 9).  Per group, the median duration of 
exposure was: 
•  65.0 weeks (range: 2.0 to 100.6 weeks) for Group 1  
•  49.5 weeks (range: 2.0 to 105.1 weeks) for Group 2  
•  48.0 weeks (range: 2.6 to 109.3 weeks) for Group 3

Assessment comment 
The observed safety findings in Group 6 are in line with the known safety profile of cemiplimab. Almost 
all patients experienced an TEAE (98.8%). Approximately 39% experienced a Grade ≥3 AEs, and 40.2% 
an SAE. The most common AEs continue to be fatigue, pruritus, rash and diarrhea. There are no new 
safety findings. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
Groups 1 to 3 
For Groups 1 to 3, 10.9% (21/193) of all patients died during the on-treatment period (Table 20).  The 
most frequently reported primary cause of death was progression of disease (7.3% [14/193]).  Most 
deaths due to progression of disease occurred in the mCSCC groups (10.2% [6/59] in Group 1 and 
12.5% [7/56] in Group 3) versus laCSCC (1.3% [1/78]) in Group 2.

*A  Patient  died  as  a  result  of  Grade  5  meningitis  on  study  day  22,    however,  the  cause  of 
death was reported as “other” as the investigator could not say if the death was due to sepsis 
[infectious]  or  carcinomatous  meningitis  [progression],  and  no  lumbar  puncture  was  done.  
Another Patient experienced sudden death on study day 139. The death certificate states the 
cause of death as ‘elderly subject’. These 2 patients are included in Table 23.

In Group 6, 11.0% (9/82) of patients experienced TEAEs resulting in death (Table 23).  None of the 
TEAEs resulting in death were considered related to cemiplimab treatment (Module 5.3.5.2 Study 1540 
Interim Group 6 CSR Post-text Table 14.3.2.3.2.g6). No patients died due to treatment-emergent 
sponsor identified imAEs (Module 5.3.5.2 Study 1540 Interim Group 6 CSR Post-text Table 
14.3.2.10.1.g6). Six of the 9 patients were aged ≥79 years old and the remaining 3 patients were >60

years old. Out of the 9 fatal TEAEs, 4 TEAEs (Sepsis, Meningitis, Cardiac failure, and COVID-19 
pneumonia; Module 5.3.5.2 Study 1540 Interim Group 6 CSR Post-text Listing 16.2.7.4.g6) occurred 
on or before study day 25 and the deaths could be attributed to the patient’s underlying medical 
condition, disease progression, or concomitant/intercurrent illnesses.  
Advanced age of the patients, concurrent comorbidities intercurrent illnesses, and the disease severity 
at the time of screening (63.4% [52/82] of patients had mCSCC of which the majority [80.8% 
(42/52)] had distant metastasis, and 41.5% [34/82] of patients had T3 or T4 stage disease at 
screening; Module 5.3.5.2 Study 1540 Interim Group 6 CSR Post-text Table 14.1.2.2.g6), are some 
possible contributory factors for the deaths in this group. Full details, including disease stage are 
included in the patient narratives provided in Module 5.3.5.2 Study 1540 Interim Group 6 CSR Section

Assessment comment 
There  were  slightly  more  TEAE  resulting  in  death  in  Group  6.  The  MAH  claim  that  none  of  them  are 
treatment related. The MAH is asked to provide brief case narratives and discuss these in more detail.

Groups 1 to 3 
For Groups 1 to 3, 38.9% (75/193) of patients experienced at least 1 serious TEAE (Table 24).   
The serious TEAEs by PT occurring in ≥2% of all patients were Cellulitis and Pneumonia (3.6% [7/193] 
each), and Sepsis (2.1% [4/193]) (Table 24). 
Overall, 11.4% (22/193) of patients experienced at least 1 treatment-related serious TEAE (Module 
5.3.5.2 Study 1540 Interim Group 6 CSR Post-text Table 14.3.2.2.3). Of those, Pneumonitis (3.1% 
[6/193]) and Autoimmune hepatitis (1.0% [2/193]) were the serious treatment-related TEAEs Grade 
≥3 reported in more than 1 patient (Module 5.3.5.2 Study 1540 Interim Group 6 CSR Post-text 
Table 14.3.2.2.4). Both Pneumonitis and Autoimmune hepatitis are listed as adverse reactions in the

Four patients (4.9%) experienced at least 1 treatment-related serious TEAE namely Febrile 
neutropenia, Adrenal insufficiency, Hypophysitis, Fatigue and Dermatitis bullous (Module 5.3.5.2 Study 
1540 Interim Group 6 CSR Post-text Table 14.3.2.2.3.g6). 
Overall, the proportion of patients who experienced at least 1 treatment-related serious TEAE and the 
proportion of patients with treatment-emergent sponsor identified serious imAEs was lower in Group 6 
than Groups 1 to 3 (treatment-related serious TEAE:  4.9% [4/82; Section 0] vs 11.4% [22/193; 
Section  0]; treatment-emergent sponsor identified serious imAEs: 2.4% [2/82; Section 0] vs 7.8% 
[15/193; Section 0]). No sponsor identified serious imAEs in Group 6 or Groups 1 to 3 had a fatal 
outcome.

Treatment-Emergent Sponsor Identified Immune-Mediated Adverse Events 
The Sponsor used the following approach to identify imAEs: 
•  The sponsor created a customized list of MedDRA PTs for the identification of imAEs called 
“Sponsor List of Potential imAE PTs”. 
•  Any treatment-related PT that was included in the sponsor list of potential imAE PTs was 
assessed as a “potential imAE” (Module 5.3.5.2 Study 1540 Interim Group 6 Analysis CSR 
Section 5.2.1.6.2.1). 
•  Any potential imAE that required treatment with systemic corticosteroid and/or other 
immunosuppressants or was an immune-mediated endocrinopathy was assessed as an 
“identified imAE” (Module 5.3.5.2 Study 1540 Interim Group 6 Analysis CSR 
Section 5.2.1.6.2.2). 
Groups 1 to 3 
In Groups 1 to 3, 21.8% (42/193) of patients experienced at least 1 treatment-emergent sponsor 
identified imAE; 5.2% (10/193) of patients discontinued study treatment due to imAEs.  
Overall, 9.8% (19/193) had treatment-emergent sponsor identified imAE of Grade ≥3 and 7.8% 
(15/193) of patients had serious treatment-emergent sponsor identified imAEs .There were 2 patients 
in Group 2 with a Grade 4 treatment-emergent sponsor identified imAE of Pneumonitis. No patient had 
a Grade 5 imAE. 
The most common (≥5% of patients) sponsor identified imAEs of any grade was Pneumonitis (6.7% 
[13/193) of patients). 
Group 6 (Interim Analysis) 
A total of 17.1% (14/82) of patients experienced a treatment-emergent sponsor identified imAE  
A total of 2.4% (2/82) of patients had a serious Grade 3 treatment-emergent sponsor identified imAEs 
and no patient had a Grade 4 or Grade 5 treatment-emergent sponsor identified imAE.  
The treatment-emergent sponsor identified imAEs of any grade reported in more than 1 patient were 
hypothyroidism (3.7% [3/82]) and arthralgia (2.4% [2/82]).

In Study 1540, there were no clinically meaningful trends in mean or median changes from baseline in 
any hematology parameters in any treatment group by study visit The majority of hematology 
abnormalities were lower than Grade 3.  
Overall, 73.7% (140/190) of patients with at least 1 postbaseline value experienced at least 
1 laboratory abnormality in hematology parameters.  
The incidence of Grade 3/4 new or worsened hematology laboratory abnormalities was 12.6% 
(24/190) of patients.  Grade 3/4 Lymphocyte count decreased (parameter lymphocytes) was reported 
by 10.0% patients (19/190 ) and Grade 3/4 Anemia (parameter hemoglobin) was reported by 5.3% 
(10/190) patients.  Grade 3/4 Neutrophil count decreased and Platelet count decreased were reported 
by 1/189 patients (0.5%) and 1/190 patients (0.5%), respectively. 
There were few incidences of TEAEs associated with hematology abnormalities.  Anemia was 
considered a TEAE in 22 patients (Module 5.3.5.2 Study 1540 Interim Group 6 CSR Post-text

1540 Interim Group 6 CSR Post-text Table 14.3.4.4).  
Clinically significant ECG abnormalities were seen in a patient in Group 1 on study day 114 within the 
context of an IRR.  The abnormalities included the following values: ECG ventricular rate 
(52 beats/minute), PR duration (224 msec), QRS duration (106 msec), QT duration (466 msec; 
baseline value was 464 msec), and RR duration (1153 msec).  The repeat ECG, which was taken 1 
minute after the clinically significant ECG abnormalities were observed, did not have clinically 
significant abnormalities (Module 5.3.5.2 Study 1540 Interim Group 6 CSR Post-text Listing 16.2.9.3).  
An IRR of Atrioventricular Block First Degree was reported for this patient (Module 5.3.5.2 Study 1540 
Interim Group 6 CSR Post-text Listing 14.3.2.9.1).  At the time of data cutoff, the patient had received 
another 10+ months of cemiplimab without other IRRs or cardiac events and continued study 
treatment (Module 5.3.5.2 Study 1540 Interim Group 6 CSR Post-text Listing 16.2.5.1 and Post-text 
Listing 16.2.7.3). 
Group 6 (Interim Analysis) 
ECG was only collected at screening (per protocol) and therefore no summary tables were generated.  
Physical Examination 
Groups 1 to 3 
There were no clinically meaningful trends in physical findings from baseline in any physical 
examination parameters in any treatment group (Module 5.3.5.2 Study 1540 Interim Group 6 CSR 
Post-text Table 14.3.4.2).  Following the data cut for this report, an error was discovered in the 
electronic data capture (EDC) pages for limited physical exams that occur during mid-cycle (Module 
5.3.5.2 Study 1540 Interim Group 6 CSR Section 9.5.1.4.1).  These pages lacked the log line for the 
heart, although heart findings were captured on EDC pages for complete physical exams that occur at 
screening, at start of each cycle, and at the end of study.  All clinically significant physical exam 
abnormalities were reported as AEs. Therefore, this deviation did not impact data integrity or patient 
safety. 
Group 6 (Interim Analysis) 
There were no clinically meaningful trends in physical findings from baseline in any physical 
examination parameters in any treatment group (Module 5.3.5.2 Study 1540 Interim Group 6 CSR 
Post-text Table 14.3.4.2g6).

Immunogenicity 
Groups 1 to 3 
One hundred and fifty-eight patients (Group 1, N=50, Group 2, N=67, Group 3, N=41) were included 
in the anti-drug antibody (ADA) population.  None of these patients (0%) experienced ADA or 
neutralizing antibody (Nabs) to cemiplimab.  Overall, the results indicate that the immunogenicity 
associated with the current dosing regimen of cemiplimab is very low in adult patients with advanced 
CSCC.  Additional details may be found in the CP report R2810-ONC-1540 02V2 available as an 
appendix of the Primary analysis CSR (approval date: 09 Jul 2019). 
Group 6 (Interim Analysis) 
Overall, immunogenicity in patients with advanced CSCC in Group 6 was low. Treatment emergent ADA 
with indeterminate response was observed in 3 patients at low titer (titer 30), with no presence of 
NAbs. No association between immunogenicity and cemiplimab concentrations in serum was observed, 
when evaluable. The presence of ADA was not associated with significant AEs or imAEs.  
Additional details including a summary table of immunogenicity results across Groups 1 to 3 and Group 
6, may be found in Module 5.3.5.2 Study 1540 Interim Group 6 CSR Appendix 5.   
Summary for Vital Signs, Physical Findings, and Other Observations Related to Safety 
Cemiplimab treatment generally did not result in clinically significant changes in vital signs or ECG 
findings. 
Assessment comment 
Overall, there seems to be no clinically meaningful differences between Groups 1-3 and Group 6. 
However, the MAH is asked to provide a tabulated overview of laboratory values for Group 1-3 and 
Group 6 side by side, and discuss any relevant difference (OC). 
Safety in special populations 
Intrinsic Factors 
Age  
Safety analyses according to age are applicable to Pool 2. There was a trend towards an increasing 
frequency of serious TEAEs and discontinuations due to TEAEs with increasing age, which is expected 
given the increase in comorbidities with increasing age in the general population. In addition, the 
sample size (n=44, 3.7%) in the age group ≥85 years is small and this limits the ability to draw 
conclusions in this age group (Table 29). There was no pattern in the reported events which would 
suggest a different risk profile in the elderly population, and the events were generally consistent with 
concomitant diseases in an elderly population. Overall, there was no clinically meaningful difference in 
the safety profile across the age groups beyond what would be expected for elderly patients with 
advanced solid malignancies.

Sex  
Safety analyses according to sex are applicable to Pool 2. There were more male patients (n=721) 
than female patients (n=477) in Pool 2 (ISS Table 14.1.2.1.s2).  
There was no apparent difference in the AE profile with regard to sex (ISS Table 14.3.1.2.1.s2). In 
Pool 2, the number of patients with any TEAE was 94.2% (42.7% of which were Grade ≥3) in males 
and 90.8% (43.0% of which were Grade ≥3) in females (ISS Table 14.3.1.2.4.s2). Similar proportions 
(<65%) of males and females in Pool 2 experienced treatment-related TEAEs of any grade (ISS Table 
14.3.1.3.4.s2), approximately 30% in each sex had serious TEAEs and <10% discontinued study 
treatment due to a TEAE (<10%) (ISS Table 14.3.1.2.1.s2). 
Race 
The demographic and baseline characteristics by race are displayed in ISS Table 14.1.2.1.s4. Most 
patients were White (269 patients in Pool 1; 982 patients in Pool 2); the remaining patients reported

“Other” (5 patients in Pool 1; 168 patients in Pool 2) or unknown/not reported (1 patients in Pool 1; 
48 patients in Pool 2) race. Patient disposition and treatment exposure by race are presented for Pool 2 
in ISS Table 14.1.1.1.s4 and ISS Table 14.1.4.1s4, respectively. 
Pool 2 TEAEs are summarized by SOC, PT, and NCI grade by race in ISS Table 14.3.1.2.4.s4. 
Treatment-related TEAEs, serious TEAEs, and treatment-related serious TEAEs are summarized by race 
in ISS Table 14.3.1.3.4.s4, ISS Table 14.3.2.1.2.s4, and ISS Table 14.3.2.2.2.s4, respectively. 
In Pool 2, there was no apparent difference in the AE profile with regard to race (ISS 
Table 14.3.1.2.1.s4). The number of patients with any TEAE was 93.1% (41.5% of which were Grade 
≥3) in white patients, 89.9% (47.6% of which were Grade ≥3) in patients of other race, and 97.9% 
(52.1% of which were Grade ≥3) in patients whose race was reported as missing. Treatment-related 
TEAEs were comparable between patients who were White (623 [63.4%] patients) and those of other 
race (104 [61.9%] patients); for those with missing race data treatment-related TEAEs were reported 
in 40 (83.3%) patients (ISS Table 14.3.1.3.4.s4). There were no apparent differences in the incidence 
of serious TEAEs regardless of race (299 [30.4%] in white patients and 59 [35.1%] patients in those of 
other race) in Pool 2; for those with missing race data serious TEAEs were reported in 16 (33.3%) 
patients (ISS Table 14.3.2.1.2.s4). The proportion of patients who discontinued study treatment due to 
a TEAE was <9% regardless of race (White and Other); 16.7% of patients with missing race had TEAEs 
leading to discontinuation of study treatment (ISS Table 14.3.1.2.1.s4). 
Assessment comment 
As expected TEAEs are observed more frequently with higher age due to comorbidities. According to 
the MAH there continues to be no clinically relevant differences in terms of race and sex. Nonetheless, 
the MAH is asked to provide a tabulated overview with regards to sex and race, and discuss the 
differences. Also, the MAH is asked to provide updated safety with regards to patients with hepatic and 
renal impairment (OC). 
Extrinsic Factors 
Region 
The demographic and baseline characteristics by region are displayed in ISS Table 14.1.2.1.s5a. Most 
patients in Pool 1 were from North America (111 patients), Europe (74 patients) followed by rest of the 
world (ROW; 90 patients). In Pool 2, most patients were from Europe (600 patients), North America 
(298 patients) and then ROW (300 patients). 
Pool 2 TEAEs are summarized by SOC, PT, and NCI grade by region in Table 14.3.1.2.4.s5a. 
Treatment-related TEAEs, serious TEAEs, and treatment-related serious TEAEs are summarized by 
region in ISS Table 14.3.1.3.4.s5a, ISS Table 14.3.2.1.2.s5a, and ISS Table 14.3.2.2.2.s5a, 
respectively. 
In Pool 2, there was no apparent difference in the AE profile with regard to region (ISS 
Table 14.3.1.2.1.s5a). The number of patients with any TEAE was 97.0% (44.3% of which were Grade 
≥3) in those from North America, 90.0% (41.2% of which were Grade ≥3) in those from Europe, and 
94.3% (44.7% of which were Grade ≥3) in those from ROW. Treatment-related TEAEs of any grade 
were reported in fewer patients from Europe (57.3%) than in ROW (67.3%) or North America (74.2%) 
(ISS Table 14.3.1.3.4.s5a). A lower proportion of patients in North America (26.5%) had serious TEAEs 
compared with Europe (32.0%) and ROW (34.3%), (ISS Table 14.3.2.1.2.s5a). A similar proportion of 
patients from the 3 regions discontinued study treatment due to a TEAE (ISS Table 14.3.1.2.1.s5a).

systemic therapy and prior radiotherapy (OC). 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with cemiplimab. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Groups 1 to 3 
For Groups 1 to 3, 10.4% (20/193) of patients experienced at least 1 TEAE resulting in discontinuation 
of study treatment (10.2% [6/59] of patients in Group 1 [mCSCC], 12.8% [10/78] of patients in 
Group 2 [laCSCC], and 7.1% [4/56] patients in Group 3 [mCSCC] [Module 5.3.5.2 Study 1540 Interim 
Group 6 CSR Table 61]). 
Most (16/20, 80%) TEAEs leading to discontinuation were considered by the investigator to be 
treatment-related (Study 1540 Interim Group 6 CSR Post text Table 14.3.2.3.6). 
The most common TEAE leading to discontinuation was Pneumonitis (3.1%), reported by 6 patients 
(6.8% [4/59] in Group 1, 2.6% [2/78] in Group 2, 0% [0/56] in Group 3) (Module 5.3.5.2 Study 1540 
Interim Group 6 CSR Table 61).  All other TEAEs that resulted in discontinuation were reported by 
1 patient each. 
Group 6 (Interim Analysis) 
For Group 6, 14.6% (12/82) of patients experienced at least 1 TEAE resulting in discontinuation of 
study treatment (Module 5.3.5.2 Study 1540 Interim Group 6 CSR Table 62). 
Seven of the 12 (58%) TEAEs leading to discontinuation were considered by the investigator to be 
treatment-related (Cortisol decreased, Dermatitis bullous, Febrile neutropenia, Immune-mediated 
gastritis, Neuropathy peripheral, Pneumonitis, and Pruritus). TEAEs leading to treatment 
discontinuation that were not considered treatment related were General physical health deterioration 
(2 patients), Duodenal ulcer hemorrhage, Cardiac failure, and Fall. 
In Group 6 [interim], fewer TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation were considered treatment 
related (58% [7/12]) compared with Groups 1 to 3 (80% [16/20]; Module 5.3.5.2 Study 1540 Interim 
Group 6 CSR Post-text Table 14.3.2.3.6.g6). 
Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Leading to Dose Reductions 
In Groups 1 to 3, there were 4 (2.1%) patients with TEAEs that resulted in dose reductions (Module 
5.3.5.2 Study 1540 Interim Group 6 CSR Table 49 and Post-text Table 14.3.1.2.1).  
In Group 6, there were no patients with TEAEs that resulted in dose reductions (Module 5.3.5.2 Study 
1540 Interim Group 6 CSR Table 51 and Post-text Table 14.3.1.2.1.g6). Of note, dose reductions were 
not part of the AE management plan for Group 6. 
Treatment Emergent Adverse Events Leading to Dose Delays or Interruptions 
Groups 1 to 3 
Assessment report  
EMA/665912/2022 
Page 90/128 
 
 
 
Overall, 39.4% (76/193) of patients experienced at least 1 TEAE resulting in dose interruption or delay 
(39.0% [23/59] in Group 1, 44.9% [35/78] in Group 2, and 32.1% [18/56] in Group 3 (Module 5.3.5.2 
Study 1540 Interim Group 6 CSR Table 63).   
The 3 most frequently reported TEAEs (PT) resulting in dose interruption or delay were Diarrhea (5.7% 
[11/193]), Pneumonitis (3.6% [7/193]), and Infusion-related Reaction (3.6% [7/193]). Post-IRR, 
infusion was restarted in all 7 patients (at a slower rate for 4 patients) and completed on the day of 
administration.  These events are listed as ADRs in the product information. 
Group 6 (Interim Analysis) 
There were 29.3% (24/82) of patients experienced at least 1 TEAE resulting in dose interruption or 
delay (Module 5.3.5.2 Study 1540 Interim Group 6 CSR Table 64).  The TEAEs (PTs) resulting in dose 
interruption or delay that occurred in more than 1 patient were Diarrhea and Infusion related reaction 
(2.4% each [2/82] each). These events are listed as ADRs in the product information. Twenty-one (21) 
of the 24 TEAEs leading to dose interruption/delay were considered treatment-related, which occurred 
in 14.6% (12/82) of patients (Module 5.3.5.2 Study 1540 Interim Group 6 CSR Post-text 
Table 14.3.2.3.13.g6). 
Assessment comment 
Overall, there are no clinically meaningful differences between Groups 1-3 and Group 6. 
Discussion 
As part of the CMA two SOBs where adopted. The MAH was asked to provide the final CSR for Groups 
1-3 and to add a Group 6 in order to confirm efficacy and safety of cemiplimab in CSCC. As agreed at a 
meeting in May 2021, the MAH provides updated results from Groups 1-3 and the interim results of 
Group 6. With the submission of these data, the MAH is proposing is seeking a standard MA for Libtayo 
within the annual renewal. The MAH commits to submitting the final CSR for Groups 1-3 by 31 October 
2022.  
The data show overall comparison between Groups 1-3 and Group 6 in terms of baseline 
characteristics. With regards to efficacy, the updated ORR and DOR from Groups 1-3 continue to show 
clinically meaningful benefit, and the ORR and DOR observed in Group 6 are in line with Group 1-3. 
The MAH has excluded two patients from the efficacy evaluation in Group 6. Both patients didn’t 
receive any treatment with cemiplimab. Thus, their exclusion is endorsed. 
Approximately half of the 84 patients in scope of the interim analysis in Group 6 had an available 
baseline tumor sample. The numbers are small, but it can with reasonable likelihood be concluded that 
efficacy of cemiplimab is not predicted by PD-L1 expression in CSCC. The results show clinical benefit 
irrespective of PD-L1 expression. This supports the continued use of cemiplimab in all-comers in this 
specific clinical setting. 
In terms of safety, the observed safety findings in Group 6 are in line with the known safety profile of 
cemiplimab. Almost all patients experienced an TEAE (98.8%). Approximately 39% experienced a 
Grade ≥3 AEs, and 40.2% an SAE. The most common AEs continue to be fatigue, pruritus, rash and 
diarrhoea. There are no new safety findings. 
Since the last annual renewal in January 2021, the CHMP has given positive opinion for two additional 
indications in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC), resulting in 
approvals by the European Commission in June 2021. Furthermore, two procedures are ongoing in 
CHMP at the moment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/665912/2022 
Page 91/128 
 
 
 
Overall, the efficacy of cemiplimab has been confirmed in several different settings, and with the 
submission of updated data from Groups 1-3 and interim data from Group 6, there are no longer any 
regulatory nor clinical arguments to keep cemiplimab on CMA. 
In conclusion, the Rapporteur is of the opinion that Specific Obligation has been fulfilled, and therefore 
recommends its deletion from the Annex II, if satisfactory responses are given to the few OCs that 
have been identified. 
5.3.  Overall conclusion on Specific Obligations 
During the period covered by this annual renewal, new data regarding the following SOBs have emerged. 
The  SOBs  are  considered  fulfilled,  if  satisfactory  responses  are  given  to  the  few  OCs  that  have  been 
identified.

Since the last annual renewal in January 2021, the CHMP has given positive opinion for two additional 
indications in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC), resulting in 
approvals by the European Commission in June 2021.  
Furthermore, two procedures are ongoing in CHMP at the moment; cemiplimab monotherapy for the 
treatment of recurrent/metastatic cervical cancer was submitted in November 2021, and cemiplimab in 
combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of locally advanced/ metastatic NSCLC was 
submitted in January 2022. Thus, the totality of evidence for cemiplimab in different cancer patient 
populations continue to show clinically meaningful results.  
In conclusion, the efficacy of cemiplimab has been confirmed in several different settings, and with the 
submission of updated data from Groups 1-3 and interim data from Group 6, there are no longer any 
regulatory nor clinical arguments to keep cemiplimab on CMA.

Since the last annual renewal with DLP 27 September 2020, the fourth PSUR (reporting period from 28 
September 2020 to 27 March 2021; EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010780/202103) has been assessed and the 
fifth PSUR (reporting period from 28 March 2021 to 27 September 2021; 
EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010780/202109) is currently under review.  
Based on the data submitted in this annual renewal procedure, the cumulative exposure to cemiplimab 
in clinical studies is estimated to be 122,151 patient-weeks (104595.7 patient-weeks in Regeneron 
studies and 17555.3 patient-weeks in non-Regeneron studies). The cumulative postmarketing 
exposure to cemiplimab is estimated to be 9,867 patient-years.  
Actions taken for safety reasons in the reporting interval 
On 08 July 2021, PRAC recommended submission of a variation with the agreed changes to the 
product information in relation to signal evaluation procedure (EPITT ref. No. 19610) on noninfective 
cystitis for the class of checkpoint inhibitors. The variation was subsequently submitted.  
On 11 Nov 2021, following PRAC review of PBRER#4 (PSUSA/00010780/202103), the CHMP adopted a 
positive opinion in relation to the addition of agreed language on diabetic ketoacidosis to the Libtayo 
PL.  
Identification important risks 
A detailed review of the safety concerns have been submitted in the PSURs and have been assessed in 
PSUSA procedures (EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010780/202103 and EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010780/202109). 
No new important risk was identified. 
Signals 
A total of four signals have been discussed in the PSURs covering the review period of this renewal. 
One signal (immune-mediated cystitis) was assessed in separate procedure (EPITT no: 19610) and led 
to an SmPC update. The review of two signals (scleroderma and scleroderma-like events and 
sclerosing cholangitis) did not lead to any new concern. Closure of these signals was accepted. The 
assessment of the last signal (Tumour Lysis Syndrome) is ongoing. The review of this signal will be 
provided as part of the next PSUSA. 
Monitored events 
From the previous PSUSA, the MAH was requested to continue to monitor the risk of rhabdomyolysis 
and return to the topic in future PSURs should relevant new information arise. No new significant 
safety concerns have been identified for risk of rhabdomyolysis, and other topics under review from 
previous PSURs (cholestasis, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, eosinophilic fasciitis, vitiligo and 
scleroderma/scleroderma like events). 
Conclusion on Safety: 
Overall, no new relevant safety information became available from the post-marketing experience 
during the reporting period of this annual renewal procedure. Of note: The fifth PSUR is currently 
under assessment (PSUSA/00010780/202109). 
7.  Risk management plan 
The MAH states that an updated RMP (v4.0), among others also related to this renewal procedure, has 
been submitted as part of an ongoing variation procedure (EMEA/H/C/004844/II/0028) with the 
purpose of extending the indication to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in combination with 
chemotherapy. Note that RMP version 3.0 to add the cervical cancer (CC) indication is currently under 
review under Procedure Number EMEA/H/C/004844/II/0026. 
The summary of safety concerns is not amended in RMP version 3.0 and 4.0.

As part of RMP version 4.0, the MAH states that the conversion of the conditional MA into a standard 
MA is requested. Furthermore, RMP Part III is updated to reflect completion of additional PV activities: 
Study R2810-ONC-1540 (A Phase 2 Study of REGN2810, A Fully Human Monoclonal Antibody to 
Programmed Cell Death-1 (PD-1), in Patients with Advanced Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma-

Medications ongoing on study day 1 included the following: carmellose sodium, irbesartan, 
paracetamol, spironolactone, apixaban, prochlorperazine, and zinc. 
Advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma was diagnosed on 02 May 2018. At the time of 
enrollment, the patient had target lesions in subcutaneous tissue, and zygoma and non-target lesion in 
the subcutaneous tissue. 
Previous cancer treatment included 6000 cGy radiation therapy to the left side of head alone (from 
study day -575 to study day -534). 
Previous procedures included shave biopsy of the left zygoma (study day -757), punch biopsy of the 
left zygoma (study day -743), excision of the left zygoma (study day -686), and fine needle aspiration 
of the left zygoma (study day -49). 
The patient was enrolled in the Group 6 cohort and was assigned to receive cemiplimab 350 mg IV 
administered over 30 minutes (±10 minutes) every 21 days for up to 108 weeks. The patient received 
the first dose of cemiplimab on study day 1 and the final dose on study day 190 for a total of 10 doses. 
Other TEAEs complicating the patient’s course included cough, dizziness, fall, fatigue, hypothyroidism, 
and rash maculo-papular. 
SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT: SMALL INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION 
SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT/ ADVERSE EVENT LEADING TO DEATH: PULMONARY EMBOLISM 
In the morning of study day 206, 16 days after the tenth dose of the study drug, the patient 
experienced umbilical pain, nausea, vomiting, and was admitted to the hospital for investigation. He 
was diagnosed with Grade 3 small intestinal obstruction (small bowel obstruction). An 
electrocardiogram (ECG) was done, and venous blood gases were tested (results not reported).  
On study day 207, a computerized tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed small bowel 
obstruction. A nasogastric tube was inserted, and paracetamol (1g PRN) and ondansetron (8 mg PRN) 
were started as treatment for the small intestinal obstruction. On the same day, a urine analysis was 
done (results not reported), and an indwelling urinary catheter was placed. On study day 208, 
additional treatment for the event of small intestinal obstruction included ondansetron (4 mg PRN) and 
buprenorphine (0.2 mg BID). On the same day, an abdominal Xray was done (results not reported). 
On study day 210, a peripherally inserted central catheter was inserted for venous access. On the 
same day, the patient underwent laparotomy, small bowel resection, and division of peritoneal 
adhesions, with additional treatment medication ondansetron (4 mg PRN) for the event of small 
intestinal obstruction. Histopathology results of the bowel resection indicated that the cause of the 
small bowel obstruction was ischemic necrosis. 
On study day 211, 21 days after the tenth dose of the study drug, the patient developed a non-serious 
event of Grade 1 cough (cough). Later the patient became unresponsive and cyanotic with episodes of 
apnea. The patient’s blood pressure was unreadable. An ECG was done (results not reported). The 
patient was not for cardiopulmonary resuscitation as per the acute resuscitation plan. The patient 
became persistently apneic, developed pallor, and had no carotid pulse present. On the same day, at 
23:35 hours, the patient was pronounced dead as a result of a serious event of Grade 5 pulmonary 
embolism (pulmonary embolism) [initially Grade 4]. No treatment was reported for the event of 
pulmonary embolism. An autopsy was not performed. 
At the time of the patient’s death, the events of small intestinal obstruction and cough were considered 
not recovered/not resolved. 
Assessment report

Action taken with study drug as a result of the event of small intestinal obstruction was drug 
interrupted/delayed. Dosing of the study drug was not resumed. Action taken with study drug as a 
result of the event of pulmonary embolism was not applicable. 
The investigator assessed the event of small intestinal obstruction as Grade 3, serious, and not related 
to study drug. The event was not suspected to be immune-related and was reported to be due to 
ischemic necrosis. 
The investigator assessed the event of pulmonary embolism as Grade 5 (initially Grade 4), serious, and 
not related to study drug. The event was not suspected to be immune-related and was reported to be 
due to a blood clot. 
The sponsor agrees with the investigator’s causality assessments.

■ SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT/ ADVERSE EVENT LEADING TO DEATH 
■ NARRATIVE SUMMARY 
A 61-year-old White, Hispanic or Latino, male, was enrolled in the Phase 2 study R2810-ONC-1540 in 
patients with advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and experienced a serious event of sepsis 
(sever sepsis) [Grade 5, initially Grade 4]. 
Relevant medical history included ischemic cardiopathy, arterial hypertension, hepatic cytolysis, 
hypercholesterolemia, anemia, suspected herpetic infection, hidradenitis suppurativa, malnutrition, and 
malignant tumoral pain. 
Medications ongoing on study day 1 included the following: acetylsalicylic acid, bisoprolol, ramipril, 
simvastatin, paracetamol, enoxaparin, dietary supplement, macrogol 3350/potassium chloride/sodium 
bicarbonate/sodium chloride, sodium phosphate dibasic/sodium phosphate dibasic dodecahydrate, 
potassium bitartrate/sodium bicarbonate, pregabalin, nefopam, liquid paraffin, clonazepam, 
cyamemazine, pantoprazole, oxycodone hydrochloride, oxycodone, and gabapentin. 
Advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma was diagnosed on 14 May 2020. Stage at screening was 
Stage IV. Metastasis was detected on 12 Aug 2020. At the time of enrollment, the patient had target 
lesions in the retroperitoneal lymph node, left iliac lymph node, and left and right inguinal lymph nodes 
and a non-target lesion on the skin of the left buttock.  
No previous cancer treatments were reported. 
Previous procedure included carcinoma resection of the skin lesion on the left lower back (study day -
120). 
The patient was enrolled in the Group 6 cohort and was assigned to receive cemiplimab 350 mg IV 
administered over 30 minutes (±10 minutes) every 21 days for up to 108 weeks. The patient received 
the first and only dose of cemiplimab on study day 1. 
Other TEAEs complicating the patient’s course included hepatocellular injury and vitamin K deficiency. 
SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT/ ADVERSE EVENT LEADING TO DEATH: SEPSIS 
On study day 1, the patient experienced non-serious events of Grade 1 hepatocellular injury (hepatic 
cytolysis) and Grade 2 vitamin K deficiency (vitamin K deficiency). Laboratory test results included 
elevated alkaline phosphatase 240 IU/L (normal range: 40 to 150 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT) 145 IU/L (normal range: 0 to 55 IU/L), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 99 IU/L (normal 
range: 5 to 34 IU/L) and normal bilirubin 7 μmol/L (normal range: 3 to 21 μmol/L) [vitamin K levels 
not reported]. Treatment included phytomenadione for the event of vitamin K deficiency, while no 
treatment was provided for the event of hepatocellular injury. On the same day, the event of vitamin K 
deficiency was considered recovered/resolved. 
On study day 4, 3 days after the first and only dose of the study drug, the patient was hospitalized due 
to a serious event of Grade 4 sepsis (severe sepsis), which most likely originated from the patient’s 
Assessment report  
EMA/665912/2022 
Page 99/128 
 
 
 
 
necrotizing dermo-hypodermitis on the left thigh coming from an inguinal fistulized tumor adenopathy. 
On the same day, the event of hepatocellular injury worsened to Grade 3. A computed tomographic 
scan with contrast showed new lesions in the left adrenal gland and mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes. 
Upon a multi-disciplinary decision, supportive treatments were given along with antibiotic therapy, 
including gentamicin (210 mg QD), piperacillin sodium/tazobactam sodium (4 g TID), and vancomycin 
(875 mg BID). On the same day, study drug was withdrawn due to progressive disease as confirmed 
by a radiologic/photographic assessment. 
On study day 6, the patient experienced a non-serious event of Grade 3 cardiac failure (cardiac 
decompensation), which was considered recovered/resolved on the same day after treatment with 
furosemide. 
On study day 10, the event of hepatocellular injury was considered recovered/resolved; however, the 
patient died due to the serious event of Grade 5 sepsis on the same day. An autopsy was not 
performed. 
No records of infectious work-up (chest X-ray or cultures of blood, urine, or wound) were provided. 
Action taken with study drug as a result of the event of sepsis was dose not changed. 
The investigator assessed the event of sepsis as Grade 5 (initially Grade 4), serious, and not related to 
study drug. The event was not immune-related and was reported to be due to an infection. The sepsis 
origin was most probably the patient’s necrotizing hypodermitis on the left thigh, which came from an 
inguinal fistulized tumoral adenopathy. Other suspected cause included the patient’s disease under 
study as the event occurred because of the disease, but it would not necessarily happen as a typical 
progression of the event. It was rather an unexpected and clinically important event as it resulted to 
the patient’s death. 
The sponsor agreed with the investigator’s assessment.

A 64-year-old White, not Hispanic or Latino, female, was enrolled in the Phase 2 study R2810-ONC-
1540 in patients with advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and experienced serious events of 
general physical condition abnormal (alteration of general state) [Grade 3, initially Grade 2] and Grade 
5 pulmonary oedema (pulmonary edema). 
Relevant medical history included hypoalbuminemia, anemia, pain of left arm, C-reactive protein 
increased, gamma-glutamyltransferase increase, and iron deficiency. 
At the time of enrollment, pain medications were oxycontin LP 10 mg PO BID and oxynormoro 10 mg 
PO Q4h. 
Advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma was diagnosed on 01 Sep 2020. Stage at screening was 
Stage III. Metastasis was detected on an unknown date. At the time of enrollment, the patient had a 
skin target lesion in the left shoulder. 
No previous cancer treatments were reported. 
Previous procedures included skin biopsy of the left shoulder (study day -24). 
The patient was enrolled in the Group 6 cohort and was assigned to receive cemiplimab 350 mg IV 
administered over 30 minutes (±10 minutes) every 21 days for up to 108 weeks. The patient received 
the first dose of cemiplimab on study day 1 and the final dose on study day 63 for a total of 4 doses. 
Other TEAEs complicating the patient’s course included xerosis, hyponatraemia, vulvovaginal mycotic 
infection, lymphopenia, presyncope, folliculitis, hypokalaemia, tongue coated, anxiety, and 
lymphoedema. 
SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS: GENERAL PHYSICAL CONDITION ABNORMAL AND PULMONARY 
OEDEMA 
During the first week on the study, fentanyl 100 mg buccal prn was added. On study day 50, 9 days 
after the third dose of the study drug, the patient experienced a serious event of Grade 2 general 
physical condition abnormal (alteration of general state) as well as events of Grade 1 diarrhoea 
(diarrhea) and Grade 1 vomiting (vomiting). 
On study day 55, stool culture was negative. 
On study day 60, the serious event of general physical condition abnormal became Grade 3, and the 
patient was subsequently hospitalized with severe pain localized on the malignancy site (left arm), 
diarrhea, and vomiting. On the same day, the patient also experienced an event of Grade 2 atrial 
fibrillation (paroxysmal atrial fibrillation). The patient was treated with diosmectite for the event of 
diarrhoea, metoclopramide hydrochloride for the event of vomiting, as well as bisoprolol, enoxaparin 
sodium, and tinzaparin sodium for the event of atrial fibrillation. Morphine IV Patient Controlled 
Anesthesia was introduced during hospitalization to reduce the pain. 
On study day 61, blood cortisol was 206.4 ng/mL (normal range: 62.4 to 180 ng/mL). 
On study day 63, blood cortisol was 192.3 ng/mL, blood thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was 2.10 
IU/mL (normal range: 0.2 to 4 IU/mL), and thyroxine was 11.1 pg/mL (normal range: 8.5 to 18 
pg/mL). 
On study day 64 (27 Nov 2020), the serious event general physical condition abnormal became less 
than Grade 3, pain was controlled, and patient was discharged from the hospital. 
On study day 71 (04 Dec 2020), the patient died due to a serious event of Grade 5 pulmonary oedema 
(pulmonary edema), which was reported to be probably caused by a new episode of atrial fibrillation.

No treatment was reported for the event of pulmonary oedema, but morphine was administered to 
treat symptom of dyspnea. The high dose of morphine caused the patient to lose alertness. Autopsy 
was not performed. No further details were reported. 
An X-ray or a computed tomography scan of the chest or an echocardiogram were not done. 
At the time of the patient’s death, the events of general physical condition abnormal, diarrhoea, 
vomiting, and atrial fibrillation were considered not recovered/not resolved. 
Action taken with study drug as a result of the events of general physical condition abnormal and 
pulmonary oedema was dose not changed. 
The investigator assessed the events as follows: 
•  General physical condition abnormal: Grade 3 (initially Grade 2), serious, and not related to 
study drug. The event was not immune-related but due to the symptoms of malignancy. 
Other suspected causes included disease under study and concurrent illness of anemia. 
•  Pulmonary oedema: Grade 5, serious, and not related to study drug. The event was not 
immune-related but probably caused by an atrial fibrillation. 
The sponsor agreed with the investigator’s assessment 
■ SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS/ADVERSE EVENT LEADING TO DEATH 
■ NARRATIVE SUMMARY 
A 67-year-old White, (ethnicity not reported), male, was enrolled in the Phase 2 study R2810-

Advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma was diagnosed on 12 Oct 2018. Stage at screening 
was Stage IV. Metastasis was detected on 21 Apr 2020.  At the time of enrollment, the patient had a 
target lesion in the neck measuring 96 mm and non-target lesions in left necrotic temporal bone 
lymph node and right cervical lymph node. 
Previous cancer treatments included the following: 5400 cGy radiation therapy to the cervical 
lymph node alone and 6000 cGy radiation therapy to the skin lesion on the back of the neck and 
vertex alone (from study day -351 to study day -302). 
Previous procedures included exeresis of the skin lesion on the back of the neck (study day - 566), 
back of the neck wide margin exeresis (study day -496 and study day -447), and biopsy of the skin 
lesion on the back of the neck (study day -36). 
The patient was enrolled in the Group 6 cohort and was assigned to receive cemiplimab 350 mg IV 
administered  over  30  minutes  (±10  minutes)  every  21  days  for  up  to  108  weeks.  The  patient 
received the first and only dose of cemiplimab on study day 1. 
Other TEAE complicating the patient’s course included impetigo. 
SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT: DYSPHAGIA 
SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT/ADVERSE EVENT LEADING TO DEATH: MENINGITIS 
On study day 2, 1 day after the first and only dose of the study drug, the patient experienced a serious 
event of Grade 3 dysphagia (dysphagia worsening) and a non-serious event of Grade 2 headache 
(acute cephalgia). 
On study day 12, the patient was hospitalized to identify the origin of the event of worsening 
dysphagia. On the same day, the patient experienced a non-serious event of Grade 1 impetigo (back of 
hand impetigo). Physical examination upon admission showed sclerous neck; facial asymmetry, which 
was probably caused by facial paralysis; and extreme difficulty in eating, drinking, and taking oral 
treatments. Treatment included nefopam hydrochloride, morphine, and diazepam for the event of 
headache and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid for the event of impetigo; no treatment medication was 
provided for the event of dysphagia. 
On study day 13, a gastronomy tube insertion was planned but was deemed impossible. 
On study day 16, the patient underwent digestive fibroscopy and gastronomy tube installation as 
treatment for the event of dysphagia. 
On study day 19, 18 days after the first and only dose of the study drug, the patient experienced a 
serious event of Grade 3 meningitis (suspected carcinomatous meningitis) and a non-serious event of 
Grade 3 malnutrition (phosphore carency due to denutrition). On the same day, a cerebral angiography 
scan showed no cerebral thrombophlebitis. A lumbar puncture was 
indicated, but the patient’s family disagreed with the procedure. The patient received antibiotic therapy 
with meropenem (2 g Q8H) and vancomycin (1 g Q12H) for the event of meningitis. 
Additional treatment for the event of malnutrition included glucose 1-phosphate disodium. On study 
day 20, the event of malnutrition improved to less than Grade 3. 
On study day 21, antibiotic therapy was stopped and only palliative care was given as the patient’s 
general state worsened. 
On study day 22, the patient died as a result of the serious event of Grade 5 meningitis. Cancer was a 
contributing factor to the patient’s death, and cause of death may be due to sepsis (infectious) or 
carcinomatous meningitis (disease progression). The cause of death was reported as “other” because 
Assessment report  
EMA/665912/2022

the investigator cannot definitively say whether the death is due to sepsis (infectious) or 
carcinomatous meningitis (disease progression) and no lumbar puncture, brain imaging or neurology 
consult was performed. It was unknown whether an autopsy was performed. 
At the time of the patient’s death, the events of dysphagia, headache, impetigo, and malnutrition were 
considered not recovered/not resolved. 
Action taken with study drug as a result of the events of dysphagia and meningitis was not applicable. 
The investigator assessed the events as follows: 
•  Dysphagia: Grade 3, serious, and not related to study drug. The event was assessed as not 
immune-related but due to a post-radiotherapy complication. Other suspected cause was the 
patient’s medical history of dysphagia due to mucositis, which occurred post-radiotherapy. The 
origin of the worsening dysphagia was unknown but could also be due to a local inflammation 
or tumoral infiltration. 
•  Meningitis: Grade 5 (initially Grade 3), serious, and not related to study drug. The event was 
assessed as not immune-related but possibly due to infectious meningitis or carcinomatous 
meningitis; precise diagnosis was impossible since no lumbar puncture was performed. Other 
suspected causes were the patient’s disease under study and concurrent illness of acute 
cephalgia. 
The sponsor agreed with the investigator’s assessment.

necrotic lymph node, left supraclavicular lymph node, left pleura, pectoral external (left side) lymph 
node, subcutaneous thickening on the left arm, and thickening on the left thoracoabdomen.  
Previous cancer treatments included radiation therapy to the left elbow (on an unknown date in 2017). 
Previous procedures included exeresis in the left elbow (study day -1106), and left arm trans humeral 
amputation and biopsy of the left axilla, left arm, and left internal face (study day -63). 
The patient was enrolled in the Group 6 cohort and was assigned to receive cemiplimab 350 mg IV 
administered over 30 minutes (±10 minutes) every 21 days for up to 108 weeks. The patient received 
the first dose of cemiplimab on study day 1 and the final dose on study day 190 for a total of 10 doses. 
Other AEs complicating the patient’s course included lymphocele, pruritus, and depression.  
SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT/ADVERSE EVENT LEADING TO STUDY DRUG 
DISCONTINUATION/ADVERSE EVENT LEADING TO DEATH: DUODENAL ULCER 
HAEMORRHAGE 
On study day -6, laboratory test results at screening included hemoglobin 141 g/L (normal range: 130 
to 160 g/L) and platelet count 280 g/L (normal range: 150 to 400 g/L). 
On study day 64, a computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast revealed new lesions in the pleura 
and left supraclavicular lymph node. 
On study day 105, the patient experienced an event of Grade 1 weight decreased (weight loss). 
On study day 127, a CT scan with contrast revealed new lesions in the left osteolytic iliac, osteolytic 
rachis, osteolytic ribs, and osteolytic sternum. 
On study day 169, the patient experienced an event of Grade 2 decreased appetite (anorexia). No 
treatment was reported for the events of weight decreased and decreased appetite. 
On study day 190, the patient experienced an event of Grade 3 general physical health deterioration 
(general state alteration), for which no treatment was reported. 
On study day 194, 4 days after the tenth dose of study drug, the patient experienced a serious event 
of Grade 3 duodenal ulcer haemorrhage (hemorrhagic duodenal bulbar ulcer) and was hospitalized due 
to general health deterioration. Laboratory test results included hemoglobin 6 g/dL (normal range not 
reported), and the patient received a transfusion of red blood cells (RBC) as treatment for the event. 
On the same day, the study drug was withdrawn due to the adverse event of duodenal ulcer 
haemorrhage. 
On study day 198, the patient received another transfusion of RBC as treatment for the event of 
duodenal ulcer haemorrhage. 
On study day 199, an esophagogastroduodenoscopy confirmed a hemorrhagic ulcer and the patient 
was diagnosed with Grade 3 oesophagitis (oesophagitis). No treatment was reported for the event of 
oesophagitis. After a review, it was decided that the patient will receive palliative care; however, the 
patient’s condition rapidly deteriorated, and the patient died on the same day. An autopsy was not 
performed. 
At the time of the patient’s death, the events of weight decreased, decreased appetite, general 
physical health deterioration, and oesophagitis were considered not recovered/not resolved. 
The investigator assessed the event of duodenal ulcer haemorrhage as Grade 5 (initially Grade 3), 
serious, and not related to study drug. The event was due to hemorrhagic ulcer of unknown origin and

■ NARRATIVE SUMMARY 
A 90-year-old White, not Hispanic or Latino, male, was enrolled in the Phase 2 study R2810-ONC-1540 
in patients with advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and experienced a serious event of 
cardiac failure (worsening heart insufficiency) [Grade 5, initially Grade 4] 
Relevant medical history included anaemia, coronary heart disease, gout, hyperkalaemia, 
hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, hyperuricemia, and lung embolism. 
Medications ongoing on study day 1 included the following: bisoprolol, hydrochlorothiazide, 
simvastatin, pantoprazole, ramipril, allopurinol, paracetamol, tramadol, pregabalin, and rivaroxaban. 
Advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma was diagnosed on 29 Jan 2020. Stage at screening was 
Stage IV. Metastasis was detected on 03 Jul 2020. At the time of enrollment, the patient had a target 
lesion in the left parotid; no non-target lesions were reported. 
No previous cancer treatments were reported. 
Previous procedures included squamous cell carcinoma excision of the skin lesion on the right hand 
(study day -193), SCC excision of the skin lesion on the left forehead (unknown study day [Feb 
2020]), and SCC metastasis biopsy of the skin lesion on the left forehead (study day -18). 
The patient was enrolled in the Group 6 cohort and was assigned to receive cemiplimab 350 mg IV 
administered over 30 minutes (±10 minutes) every 21 days for up to 108 weeks. The patient received 
the first and only dose of cemiplimab on study day 1. 
Other TEAEs complicating the patient’s course included rash. 
■ SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT/ ADVERSE EVENT LEADING TO STUDY DRUG 
DISCONTINUATION/ADVERSE EVENT LEADING TO DEATH: CARDIAC FAILURE 
On study day 18, 17 days after the first and only dose of the study drug, the patient fell asleep and 
died at home due to a serious event of Grade 5 cardiac failure (worsening heart insufficiency) [initially 
Grade 4]. No treatment was provided for the event, and no further information was available. 
Echocardiogram and chest X-ray were not done. Troponin level was not reported. 
Action taken with study drug as a result of the event of cardiac failure was drug withdrawn 
permanently. 
The investigator assessed the event of cardiac failure as Grade 5 [initially Grade 4], serious, and   
not related to study drug. The event was not suspected to be immune-related but was suspected

On study day 17, the patient started to experience fever (body temperature of 37.5°C), cough, and 
rhinorrhea. 
On study day 20, 19 days after the first and only dose of the study drug, the patient presented to the 
emergency room with fever (body temperature of 38°C), chills, liquid stool without pathological 
products, and skin dehydration. Oxygen saturation (SpO2) was 92%, which later improved to 97%. 
The patient was diagnosed with a serious event of Grade 3 COVID-19 pneumonia (bilateral pneumonia 
due to COVID-19) and was hospitalized. A polymerase chain reaction test was positive for severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The patient’s SpO2 ranged from 95% to 96% following 
administration of oxygen 2 L/minute via nasal cannula. A thoracic X-ray showed pulmonary 
parenchyma with patchy and poorly defined increases in density, bilateral and peripheral distribution. 
An abdominal X-ray was also performed (results not reported). A blood culture was positive for an 
unknown species and was negative for Staphylococcus plasmocoagulase. A stool culture was negative 
for Clostridium difficile, salmonella, shigella, yersinia, campylobacter, and aeromonas. A urine 
ionogram results included urea/creatinine 7.89 mg/mg, sodium/creatinine 1.8 mol/mol, and 
potassium/creatinine 
3.6 mol/mol (normal ranges not reported). Treatment for the event included azithromycin 
(500 mg QD), ceftriaxone (1 g QD), hydroxychloroquine (400 mg BID), lopinavir (400 mg QD), and 
ritonavir (100 mg QD). 
On study day 22, the patient’s renal function impairment persisted with blood creatinine value of 
2.9 mg/dL (normal range not reported). 
On study day 25, the patient died due to the adverse event of Grade 5 COVID-19 pneumonia (bilateral 
pneumonia due to COVID-19). An autopsy was not performed, and discharge summary was not 
provided. 
Action taken with study drug as a result of the event of COVID-19 pneumonia was dose not changed. 
The investigator assessed the event of COVID-19 pneumonia as Grade 5 (initially Grade 3), serious, 
and not related to study drug. The event was not immune-related but due to an infection. There were 
no other suspected causes. 
The sponsor agrees with the investigator’s assessment. Risk factors included the history of cancer, 
advanced age, and obesity.

Stage IV. Metastasis was detected on 05 Jul 2020. At the time of enrollment, the patient had a target 
lesion in the left laterocervical mass and a non-target lesion in the left bone. 
Previous cancer treatments included 5510 cGy radiation therapy to the cervical lymph node alone and 
6380 cGy radiation therapy to the left retroauricular region alone (from study day -226 to study day -
178) and 1200 cGy radiation therapy to the cervical lymph node alone and 3000 cGy radiation therapy 
to the left retroauricular region alone (from study day -61 to study day -43). 
Previous procedures included retroauricular lesion resection (study day -778) and retroauricular 
relapse resection (study day -301). 
The patient was enrolled in the Group 6 cohort and was assigned to receive cemiplimab 350 mg IV 
administered over 30 minutes (±10 minutes) every 21 days for up to 108 weeks. The patient received 
the first dose of cemiplimab on study day 1 and the final dose on study day 85 for a total of 5 doses. 
Other TEAEs complicating the patient’s course included post procedural infection, dyspnoea, mucosal 
inflammation, and blood phosphorus decreased. 
SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT: PNEUMONIA 
On study day 24, 1 day after the second dose of the study drug, the patient went to the 
emergency room (ER) due to dyspnea and total impossibility of ingestion. The patient was 
hospitalized due to a serious event of Grade 3 pneumonia (left basal pneumonia), which was 
confirmed by a chest X-ray. On the same day, the patient underwent a percutaneous endoscopic 
gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement for the underlying cancer. Treatment for the event of 
Assessment report

pneumonia included ceftriaxone (2 g QD), clindamycin (600 mg Q8H), and amoxicillin/clavulanic 
acid (875/125 mg QD). 
On study day 34, the patient developed a non-serious event of Grade 2 post procedural infection 
(percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy infection) at the site of the PEG tube. Treatment for the 
event of post procedural infection included amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. 
On study day 35, a port-a-cath was placed for the patient’s underlying cancer. 
On study day 36, the event of pneumonia was considered recovered/resolved. On the same day, 
the patient had a good clinical progress and was discharged from the hospital. 
On study day 41, the event of post procedural infection was considered recovered/resolved. 
Action taken with study drug as a result of the event of pneumonia was dose not changed. 
The investigator assessed the event of pneumonia as Grade 3, serious, and not related to study 
drug. The event was not suspected to be immune-related but due to an infection. Other suspected 
cause included tumoral obstruction. 
The sponsor agreed with the investigator’s assessment. 
SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT/ADVERSE EVENT LEADING TO DEATH: PNEUMONIA 
On study day -13, laboratory test result at screening included phosphate 3.3 mg/dL (normal 
range: 2.7 to 4.5 mg/dL). 
On study day 62, the patient experienced a non-serious event of Grade 1 dyspnoea (dyspnea). 
Treatment for the event of dyspnoea included amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. 
On study day 63, the event of dyspnoea was considered recovered/resolved. 
On study day 106, 21 days after the fifth dose of the study drug, the patient went to a scheduled 
oncology visit, and a physical examination showed clinically significant abnormality of the lungs. The 
patient was then referred to the ER and was diagnosed with a serious event of Grade 3 pneumonia 
(bronchoaspiratory pneumonia). On the same day, a non-serious event of Grade 1 blood 
phosphorus decreased (phosphorus decreased) was noted. The patient had an Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group performance status of 2 to 3, worsening of respiratory problems, and cough. Vital 
signs included blood pressure 80/52 mmHg, heart rate 104 beats per minute, respiratory rate 16 
breaths per minute, and body temperature 36.1°C. A chest X-ray showed no parenchymal infiltrates 
and no pleural effusion. A polymerase chain reaction test for COVID-19 was negative, which also 
confirmed the diagnosis of pneumonia. Laboratory test results showed low phosphate 2.2 mg/dL, 
albumin 2.28 g/dL (normal range: 3.50 to 5.00 g/dL), magnesium 
1.36 mg/dL (normal range: 1.40 to 2.40 mg/dL), and lymphocyte count 0.68 × 109/L (normal 
range: 1.00 to 4.50 × 109/L) and elevated urea 72 mg/dL (normal range: 15 to 45 mg/dL). 
Treatment for the event of pneumonia included piperacillin/tazobactam (4/0.5 g Q6H). No treatment 
was reported for the event of blood phosphorus decreased. The patient’s condition did not improve with 
rapid clinical deterioration. 
On study day 108, the patient died due to the adverse event of Grade 5 pneumonia  
bronchoaspiratory pneumonia). An autopsy was not performed. 
At the time of the patient’s death, the event of blood phosphorus decreased was considered not 
recovered/not resolved. 
Assessment report  
EMA/665912/2022

Action taken with study drug as a result of the event of pneumonia was not applicable. 
The investigator assessed the event of pneumonia as Grade 5 [initially Grade 3], serious, and not 
related to study drug. The patient’s death was due to bronchoaspiratory pneumonia, which was not 
suspected to be an immune-related event. There were no other suspected causes. 
The sponsor assessed the event of fatal aspiration pneumonia on study day 108 as not related to 
study drug. The patient had prior hospitalization for pneumonia (study day 24) in which PEG tube 
was placed due to inability to tolerate oral intake. This clinical situation is a well established clinical 
risk factor for subsequent aspiration pneumonia, which caused death on study day 108. 
■ SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT/ ADVERSE EVENT LEADING TO DEATH 
■ NARRATIVE SUMMARY 
An 88-year-old White, not Hispanic or Latino, male, was enrolled in the Phase 2 study R2810-ONC-
1540 in patients with advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and experienced a serious event of 
Grade 5 sudden death (sudden death). 
Relevant medical history included arterial hypertension, diuresis, hypocalcemia, hypothyroidism, 
insomnia, and ulcer malignant tumor right ear (confirmed focus of cutaneous squamous cell 
carcinoma). 
Medications ongoing on study day 1 included the following: aliskiren, diazepam, furosemide, 
lercanidipine, tramadol, venlafaxine, levothyroxine, imiquimod, and ferrous sulfate. 
Advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma was diagnosed on 12 Jun 2009. Stage at screening was 
Stage III. Metastasis was detected on an unknown date. At the time of enrollment, the patient had a 
left retroauricular target lesion (110 X 80mm) and non-target lesions in regional lymph nodes. 
No previous cancer treatments were reported. 
Previous procedures included left auricular pavilion lesion exeresis of the head and neck (study day -
4060) and Mohs surgery of the head and neck (study day -164). 
The patient was enrolled in the Group 6 cohort and was assigned to receive cemiplimab 350 mg IV 
administered over 30 minutes (±10 minutes) every 21 days for up to 108 weeks. The patient received 
the first dose of cemiplimab on study day 1 and the final dose on study day 109 for a total of 6 doses. 
No other AEs complicating the patient’s course were reported during the study. 
SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT/ ADVERSE EVENT LEADING TO DEATH: SUDDEN DEATH 
On study day 126, the patient’s Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors showed progressive 
disease per investigator assessment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/665912/2022 
Page 111/128 
 
 
 
 
On study day 139, 30 days after the sixth dose of the study drug, the patient experienced a serious 
event of Grade 5 sudden death (sudden death). No treatment was reported. The patient died at home 
and was visited by a primary care staff from a different sanitary department. No autopsy was 
performed, and the death certificate supported cause of death as due to old age. No other possible 
reasons for the event of sudden death were reported. The patient had not experienced any adverse 
events related to cemiplimab prior to his death. 
Action taken with study drug as a result of the event of sudden death was not applicable. 
Per the study site: The death certificate supports the cause of ‘elderly subject’ for this SAE and no 
other possible reasons for the sudden death are reported. 
The investigator assessed the event of sudden death as Grade 5, serious, and not related to study 
drug. Other suspected causes included disease under study, concurrent illness, and old age.  
The sponsor assessed the event of sudden death as not related to study drug. Limited information on 
the circumstances surrounding the event was provided, but the event was presented 1 month after the 
administration of the last dose. The sponsor concurs with the investigator’s assessment that there is no 
evidence that sudden death was related to study drug in this 88 year-old patient with progressive 
advanced CSCC and no prior cemiplimab toxicity. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH has provided brief case narratives for the 9 patients. These have been carefully reviewed and 
the MAH’s position is endorsed. There seems to be no relationship between these TEAEs leading to 
death and the use of cemiplimab. 
Conclusion 
Issue resolved.  
Question 2  
Overall,  there  seems  to  be  no  clinically  meaningful  differences  between  Groups  1-3  and  Group  6. 
However, the MAH is asked to provide a tabulated overview of laboratory values for Group 1-3 and Group 
6 side by side, and discuss any relevant difference. 
MAH’s response 
The Applicant has provided the requested tables in Table 1 (hematology), Table 2 (electrolytes), Table 
3 (liver function), and Table 4 (chemistry; other). Clinically relevant laboratory abnormalities were 
captured in the proposed ADR table in the SmPC. While there appear to be heterogeneity within 
expected variability between the groups, excluding laboratory abnormalities associated with identified 
immune-mediated adverse events (imAEs), there are no clinically relevant differences in laboratory 
values for Groups 1 to 3 and Group 6.

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH has provided the requested tables. Despite small differences, none are considered clinically 
meaningful. It seems to be confirmed that no clinically meaningful differences between Groups 1-3 and 
Group 6 exist.

Conclusion 
Issue resolved.  
Question 3  
As expected TEAEs are observed more frequently with higher age due to comorbidities. According to the 
MAH there continues to be no clinically relevant differences in terms of race and sex. Nonetheless, the 
MAH is asked to provide a tabulated overview with regards to sex and race, and discuss the differences. 
Also,  the  MAH  is  asked  to  provide  updated  safety  with  regards  to  patients  with  hepatic  and  renal 
impairment. 
MAH’s response 
The Applicant has provided tabulated overviews for Pool 1 (all CSCC patients) and Pool 2 (all 
cemiplimab monotherapy patients) based on: 
Sex 
There were minor numerical differences between gender groups (males compared to females) for 
both the CSCC population and Pool 2, which were not clinically relevant. For the CSCC patients 
the comparisons are summarised below. 
•  Number of patients with any TEAE (99.6% vs. 98.0%) 
•  Number of patients with any TEAE ≥ grade 3 (46.9% vs. 42.9%) 
•  Number of patients with any serious TEAE (38.5% vs. 42.9%) 
•  Number of patients who discontinued treatment due to TEAE (11.1% vs. 14.3%) 
•  Number of patients with any TEAE leading to drug interruption/delay (35.0% vs. 42.9%) 
•  Number of patients with any TEAE leading to death (5.3% vs. 4.1%)

Race 
Due to the nature of the underlying disease, CSCC, the vast majority (267/269) of patients in Pool 1 
were white, with only 5 patients with “Other” race, and one patient with “Missing” race. The small 
number of patients with “Other” or “Missing” race limits the ability to make comparisons between 
groups. Most patients in Pool 2 were also white (n=982), with fewer patients in "Other" (n=168) and 
"Missing" (n=48) race. Overall, there were no relevant differences in the safety profile based on race. 
Assessment report  
EMA/665912/2022

Renal and Hepatic Impairment 
In general, there was a slight trend towards a higher proportion of patients with any TEAE across all 
categories of organ function, including normal organ function, in Pool 1 compared with Pool 2, which 
likely reflects the higher median age and associated burden of comorbidities of patients in Pool 1 (all 
CSCC patients) compared with Pool 2 (all cemiplimab monotherapy patients). The trend is not 
considered to be clinically relevant. There was no relevant difference in the type of TEAEs observed 
based on severity of organ impairment.

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH has provided the requested tables and a short discussion. There are no clinically meaningful 
difference between men and women. With regards to race, most patients are white, so no firm 
conclusions can the drawn. Concerning, renal and hepatic impairment, no new signal are observed.  
Conclusion 
Issue resolved.  
Question 4  
The MAH is asked to provide a tabulated overview of updated safety as function of region, prior 
systemic therapy and prior radiotherapy. 
MAH’s response 
The Applicant has provided a tabulated overview in Table 5 (region), Table 6 (Prior systemic therapy), 
and Table 7 (Prior radiotherapy), respectively.

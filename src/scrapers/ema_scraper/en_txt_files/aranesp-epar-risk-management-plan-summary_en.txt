PART VI:  SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
Summary of Risk Management Plan for Aranesp (darbepoetin alfa) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Aranesp.  The RMP details 
important risks of Aranesp, how these risks can be minimized, and how more information 
will be obtained about Aranesp's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Aranesp's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet (PL) give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Aranesp should be 
used. 
This summary of the RMP for Aranesp should be read in the context of all this 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all of which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Aranesp's RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Aranesp is authorized for the treatment of symptomatic anemia associated with chronic 
kidney failure (renal failure) in adults and pediatric patients (nephrology indication) and 
treatment of symptomatic anemia in adult cancer patients with non-bone marrow 
cancers (non-myeloid malignancies) receiving chemotherapy (oncology indication) (see 
SmPC for the full indication).  It contains darbepoetin alfa as the active substance and it 
is given by injection either into a vein (intravenous) or under the skin (subcutaneous). 
Further information about the evaluation of Aranesp’s benefits can be found in Aranesp’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the European Medicines 
Agency (EMA) website, under the medicine’s webpage:  
https://www.ema.europa.eu/medicines/human/EPAR/Aranesp. 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimize or further 
characterize the risks  
Important risks of Aranesp together with measures to minimize such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about Aranesp's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in 
the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorized pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the public (eg, with 
or without prescription) can help to minimize its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In the case of Aranesp, these measures are supplemented with additional risk 
minimization measures mentioned under relevant risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse events is collected 
continuously and regularly analyzed including periodic safety update report (PSUR) 
assessment so that immediate action can be taken as necessary.  These measures 
constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
II.A.  List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of Aranesp are risks that need special risk management activities to 
further investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely 
administered.  Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential.  Identified risks 
are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Aranesp.  
Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is 
possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and 
needs further evaluation.  Missing information refers to information on the safety of the 
medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (eg, on the 
long-term use of the medicine). 
List of important risks and missing information 
Important identified risks 
•  Antibody-mediated pure red cell aplasia (nephrology 
indication only) 
Important potential risks 
•  Mortality and/or tumor progression or recurrence in 
patients with cancer or a history of cancer 
•  Antibody-mediated pure red cell aplasia (oncology 
• 
indication only) 
Incorrect use of the pre-filled pen device associated with 
adverse reactions, including underdose and drug dose 
omission 
II.B.  Summary of Important Risks 
Important identified risk:  Antibody-mediated pure red cell aplasia (development of antibodies 
to the hormone that stimulates the production of red blood cells, which causes the body to stop 
the production of red blood cells) (nephrology indication only) 
Evidence for 
linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Risk factors and 
risk groups 
This risk was identified in the postmarketing setting.  Most cases of pure 
red cell aplasia were reported for patients with chronic kidney disease.  
Antibody-mediated pure red cell aplasia is considered an important 
identified risk in the nephrology indication and an important potential risk 
in the oncology indication since only a small number of cases have been 
identified in cancer patients. 
Pure red cell aplasia, in association with antibodies to the hormone that 
stimulates the production of red blood cells, has been observed in 
patients treated with medicines that stimulate the production of red blood 
cells in the body (erythropoiesis-stimulating agents), including 
darbepoetin alfa.  Pure red cell aplasia has been reported predominantly 
in patients with chronic kidney disease and in patients with hepatitis C 
treated with interferon and ribavirin.  Most cases have been associated 
with under-the-skin administration of medicines that stimulate the 
production of red blood cells in the body (erythropoiesis-stimulating 
agents). 
No other risk factor has been identified with darbepoetin alfa.

Risk factors and 
risk groups 
Risk minimization 
measures 
This potential risk was identified in the clinical trial setting.  Increased 
death or adverse cancer outcomes were observed with medicines that 
stimulate the production of red blood cells in the body 
(erythropoiesis-stimulating agents) in 8 clinical studies conducted in 
subjects with cancer.  In the nephrology indication, the potential risk of 
death in subjects with a history of malignancy was identified based on a 
post-hoc subgroup analysis of a randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study called the Trial to Reduce Cardiovascular (heart 
and blood vessel) Events with Aranesp Therapy (TREAT). 
There are no data available describing risk factors for death among 
patients with chronic renal failure who have a history of cancer and are 
receiving medicines that stimulate the production of red blood cells in the 
body (erythropoiesis-stimulating agent therapy). 
In patients with cancer, adverse tumor outcomes and death are closely 
linked with tumor characteristics including tumor type, stage, 
responsiveness to therapy, and where the cancer has spread, and patient 
factors including age, nutritional status, comorbidity, and weakness of the 
body’s immune system (immune suppression).

•  SmPC Section 5.1 
•  SmPC Section 5.3

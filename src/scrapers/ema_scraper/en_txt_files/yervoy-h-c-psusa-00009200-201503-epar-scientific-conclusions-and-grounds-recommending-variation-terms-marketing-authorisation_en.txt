Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for ipilimumab, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
The MAH has presented a review of cases of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome. Although the number 
of cases is limited, the prevalence is twice higher than that reported for VKH in the general 
populations. In addition, there is evidence of a possible immune-related mode of action involving 
Th17 cells that may justify a causal role of ipilimumab. Based on this evidence a causal relationship 
between VKH syndrome and ipilimumab treatment cannot be refuted. Therefore, the Summary of 
Product Characteristics (SmPC) should be updated with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome as an 
adverse drug reaction in sections 4.4 and 4.8. The Package Leaflet already covers adequately 
immune related adverse reactions, therefore no updates are necessary. 
Therefore, in view of available data regarding ipilimumab, the PRAC considered that changes to the 
product information were warranted.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for ipilimumab the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product containing ipilimumab is favourable subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.

1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Taiho Pharma Europe Ltd. submitted on 27 February 2015 an application for Marketing 
Authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Lonsurf, through the centralised procedure falling 
within the Article 3(1) and point 3 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised 
procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 21 November 2013. On 19 October 2015, the marketing 
authorisation application was transferred to Les Laboratoires Servier. 
The applicant applied for the following indication. 
Lonsurf is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) who have been 
previously treated with, or are not considered candidates for, available therapies including fluoropyrimidine-, 
oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based chemotherapy, an anti-VEGF biological therapy, and an anti-EGFR therapy.  
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application. The applicant indicated that tipiracil 
was considered to be a new active substance. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical and 
clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature substituting/supporting 
certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) CW/1/2011 
on the granting of a class waiver.  
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan 
medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the 
proposed indication. 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance tipiracil (as hydrochloride) contained in the above medicinal 
product to be considered as a new active substance in itself, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent 
of a product previously authorised within the Union.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in men and the second most common cancer in women 
worldwide (Globocan 2012). In Europe, CRC is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the second leading 
cause of cancer death. CRC was responsible for 215 000 deaths in Europe in 2012. The stage of disease at the 
time of diagnosis represents the most relevant prognostic factor. Five-year survival rates range from 93% for 
stage I disease to less than 10% for stage IV1.  
Surgery, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy in certain cases, represents the standard therapeutic approach for 
patients with loco-regional disease. However, approximately 25% of patients present with metastases at initial 
diagnosis and almost 50% of patients with CRC will develop metastases, contributing to the high mortality rates 
reported for CRC. The CRC-related 5-year survival rate approaches 60%2. 
At present, there is no curative treatment for patients with mCRC. When left untreated, patients have a poor 
prognosis, with a median survival of about 6 months. With the exception of few selected patients where 
resection of metastases is indicated, the standard treatment for patients with metastatic disease is represented 
by systemic chemotherapy, which has demonstrated to significantly improve overall survival to an average of 20 
months. The currently available systemic chemotherapeutic options for patients with mCRC consist essentially 
of fluoropyrimidine based regimens alone or in combination with oxaliplatin (FOLFOX, CAPOX) or irinotecan 
(FOLFIRI, CAPIRI). Fluoropyrimidine based regimens have demonstrated similar activity when given as first or 
second line therapy. Addition of the anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody bevacizumab to the above mentioned first 
or second line chemotherapies has been approved. In patients with RAS wild-type mCRC, the anti-epidermal 
growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibodies cetuximab or panitumumab can also be administered as 
monotherapy or in combination with fluoropyrimidine-based regimens. 
Aflibercept has been registered in combination with irinotecan/5-fluorouracil/folinic acid (FOLFIRI) 
chemotherapy in adults with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) that is resistant to or has progressed after an 
oxaliplatin-containing regimen. Regorafenib is an oral tumour deactivation agent that potently blocks multiple 
protein kinases, including kinases involved in tumour angiogenesis (VEGFR1, -2, -3, TIE2), oncogenesis (KIT, 
RET, RAF-1, BRAF, BRAFV600E), and the tumour microenvironment (PDGFR, FGFR). Regorafenib was approved 
for the treatment of patients with mCRC who have been previously treated with, or are not considered 
candidates for, available therapies. These include fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy, an anti-VEGF therapy 
and an anti-EGFR therapy.

About the product 
TAS-102 (trifluridine/tipiracil, Lonsurf) 15 and 20 mg tablets, is a new antineoplastic agent. Lonsurf is comprised 
of an antineoplastic thymidine-based nucleoside analogue, trifluridine, and the thymidine phosphorylase 
(TPase) inhibitor, tipiracil hydrochloride, at a molar ratio 1:0.5 (weight ratio, 1:0.471).  
Following uptake into cancer cells, trifluridine, is phosphorylated by thymidine kinase, further metabolised in 
cells to a deoxyribonucleic acid DNA substrate, and incorporated directly into DNA, thereby interfering with DNA 
function to prevent cell proliferation.  However, trifluridine is rapidly degraded by TPase and readily metabolised 
by a first-pass effect following oral administration, hence the inclusion of the TPase inhibitor, tipiracil 
hydrochloride.  In nonclinical studies, trifluridine/tipiracil hydrochloride demonstrated antitumour activity 
against both 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) sensitive and resistant colorectal cancer cell lines. The cytotoxic activity of 
trifluridine/tipiracil hydrochloride against several human tumour xenografts correlated highly with the amount 
of trifluridine incorporated into DNA, suggesting this as the primary mechanism of action. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
Lonsurf is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) who have been 
previously treated with, or are not considered candidates for, available therapies including fluoropyrimidine-, 
oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based chemotherapy, an anti-VEGF biological therapy, and an anti-EGFR therapy. 
The recommended indication is: 
Lonsurf is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) who have been 
previously treated with, or are not considered candidates for, available therapies including fluoropyrimidine-, 
oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based chemotherapies, anti-VEGF agents, and anti EGFR agents. 
The recommended starting dose of Lonsurf in adults is 35 mg/m2/dose administered orally twice daily on Days 
1 to 5 and Days 8 to 12 of each 28-day cycle as long as benefit is observed or until unacceptable toxicity occurs 
(see section 4.4). 
The dosage is calculated according to body surface area (BSA).  The dosage must be rounded to the nearest 5 
mg increment.  The dosage must not exceed 80 mg/dose. If doses were missed or held, the patient must not 
make up for missed doses.

2.2.2.  Active  substance 
Trifluridine  
General information 
The chemical name of trifluridine is 2'-deoxy-5-(trifluoromethyl)uridine corresponding to the molecular formula 
C10H11F3N2O5. It has a relative molecular mass of 296.20 g/mol and the following structure: 
The active substance is a non-hygroscopic white crystalline powder soluble in water and buffer solution at pH 
2-12.   
Trifluridine exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of 3 chiral centres in the sugar moiety. 
Stereoisomerism is controlled by starting material specifications and process reaction conditions. In addition, 
enantiomeric purity is controlled routinely by specific optical rotation. 
Polymorphism has been observed for active substance. The chosen crystal form is consistently manufactured

2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Trifluridine/Tiparacil Hydrochloride (FTD/TPI) is an immediate release film-coated tablet. The different tablet 
strengths are appropriately differentiated by their colour and imprinting as follows: 
15/7.065 mg film-coated tablets are white, round, biconvex, imprinted with "15" on one side, and "102" and "15 
mg" on the other side, in gray ink. The tablets have a diameter of approximately 7.1 mm and a thickness of 
approximately 2.7 mm. 
EMA/CHMP/287846/2016 
Page 16/106 
  
  
  
20/9.420 mg film-coated tablets are pale red, round, biconvex, imprinted with "20" on one side and "102" and 
"20 mg" on the other side in gray ink. The tablets have a diameter of approximately 7.6 mm and a thickness of 
approximately 3.2 mm. 
Both active substances are BCS class III compounds.  The influence of the particle size distribution of both active 
substances on the content uniformity of tablets, the dissolution profile and the tablet hardness was studied. 
Based on the study results the particle size of FTD was not considered to be critical. Regarding TPI, the results 
indicated that particle size distribution of this API has an impact on the content uniformity of tablets.  
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards. 
The colorants used comply with EU regulation 231/2012. There are no novel excipients used in the finished 
product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this 
report. The choice of the excipients has been satisfactorily justified and their levels have been chosen based on 
formulation optimisation studies. The compatibility of the active substance with the excipients and the 
compatibility of active substance with each other have been adequately demonstrated. 
Both formulations (15/7.065 mg and 20/9.420 mg tablets) are dose proportionate. 
For the finished product, the base formulation used in clinical studies for other clinical indications formed the 
starting point for the development of tablets for the proposed indication. Using this base formulation, an early 
clinical trial formulation was developed in order to optimize the manufacturing method.   The process employed 
to produce the base formulation was chosen in view of excipient compatibility results. Lactose monohydrate as 
a diluent, carmellose as a disintegrant and stearic acid as a lubricant were selected as the excipients based on 
compatibility test results for the base formulation. In addition, a film coating was applied to prevent any hazard 
due to dusting of high potency active substances. Because carmellose in the base formulation was not a 
compendial article in Europe or the US at the time of development, to facilitate regulatory approval, the 
disintegrant was changed from non-compendial carmellose to compendial pregelatinized starch. Furthermore 
there was a concern regarding exposure to the active ingredients during manufacturing. Thus, the 
manufacturing method was changed to a direct compression method that is simpler and causes less dusting and 
minimizes exposure to the active ingredients. Associated with the change in the manufacturing method, a 
different type of lactose monohydrate was used as the diluent. After that, minor changes were made (e.g. for 
both strength magnesium stearate was added; for the 20 mg strength, the shape of the tablet was changed and 
red ferric oxide was added) to develop the late clinical trial formulation used in the Phase III clinical study. The 
compositions of the phase III clinical batches are the same as the to-be marketed formulation, with the 
exception regarding the imprinting on the tablet surface. The manufacturing process is the same with the 
difference of the batch scale (four-fold increase), and the manufacturing site. 
The comparative dissolution profiles of phase I/II formulation vs phase III formulation using the Quality Control 
(QC) method and the following medium: water, buffered media at pH 1.2/4.5/6.8, FaSSIF (fasted state 
simulated intestinal fluid, pH 6.5) and FeSSIF (fed state simulated intestinal fluid, pH 5.0) showed that the 
differences between phase I/II formulation and phase III formulation do not affect dissolution.  To provide 
further assurance that phase I/II formulation and phase III formulation are comparable, a bioavailability study 
was performed using the highest dose strength tablets (20 mg). It was concluded that the differences in the 
formulation and tablet shape had no influence on in vivo absorption. 
The comparative dissolution profiles of phase III formulation vs proposed formulation using the QC method and 
the QC medium (0.1 N HCl) showed that the differences between phase III formulation and the proposed 
formulation do not affect dissolution.   
The discriminatory power of the dissolution method has been demonstrated.

FTD/TPI film-coated tablets are manufactured by a standard compression process. The studies performed 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process posed no risk to content uniformity. 
The primary packaging is aluminium/aluminium blister with laminated desiccant (calcium oxide). The material 
complies with EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data 
and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of four main steps: milling of the two active substances, mixing of the raw 
materials, tableting and film-coating. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies on three production scale 
batches per tablet strength. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing 
the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The critical steps have been identified .The 
in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. Information 
about the storage and transportation of the bulk tablet are provided. The maximum holding time for the bulk 
tablets is validated. 
Product specification  
The finished product release and shelf-life specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form : 
description, identification (HPLC, UV), dissolution (HPLC, Ph. Eur.), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), 
elemental impurities (Ph. Eur.), related substances (HPLC), assay (HPLC), water content  (Ph. Eur.), and 
microbial test (Ph. Eur.).  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the 
ICH guidelines.  Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities 
testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for several development batches including clinical batches and for three 
production scale batches per strength confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to 
manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data were provided for three production scale batches of each strength stored under long term 
conditions for 18 months at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH 
according to the ICH guidelines. The batches of medicinal product are identical to those proposed for marketing 
and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested according to shelf-life specifications described in the section above. The analytical 
procedures used are stability indicating. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug 
Substances and Products. 
No significant changes have been observed in the long term and accelerated stability studies. Photostability 
results demonstrated that the product is not light sensitive. 
EMA/CHMP/287846/2016 
Page 18/106 
  
  
  
To support the storage and shipment of bulk tablets to the packaging site, the following studies have been 
performed: bulk stability studies, thermal cycle study (-20˚C - 40˚C/75% RH), bulk shipping studies. No 
significant changes have been observed.  
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 30 months with no special storage precaution as 
stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as those used 
to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the use of ruminant 
material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of Transmitting Animal 
Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal products. 
The magnesium stearate and stearic acid are of vegetable origin. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have 
a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
TAS-102 has undergone a series of nonclinical studies to support its use in adult patients with metastatic 
colorectal cancer who have been previously treated with, or are not candidates for, standard chemotherapies. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro studies 
The IC50 values of FTD and 5-Fu for inhibition of cultured human cancer cell line investigated in study 
20061-004, were in a similar range, varying from 0.214-24.4 µM for FTD and from 3.18-17.7 µM for 5-FU. 
However, the IC50s against cell lines DU145 and CCRF-CEM differed markedly between FTD (1.48 and 0.214 
µM) and 5-FU (7.70 and 8.40 µM). 
Table 10: Influence of FTD and 5-FU (IC50 µM) on the proliferation of human cancer cell lines in vitro 
In a study investigating the sustainability of inhibitory effect of FTD on TS by measurement of intracellular dTTP 
pool in HeLa cells (study 20111-003), the dTTP pool was reduced during exposure to both FTD and FdUrd, but 
the dTTP pool following drug washout recovered markedly better with FTD than with FdUrd. TS inhibitory action 
was cancelled more quickly following drug washout with FTD than with FdUrd.

Figure  4:  Influence  of  FTD  or  FdUrd  on  the  dTTP  pool  (T/C%)  after  4  h  incubation  (Pre-drug 
washout) and following 4 h washout (Post-drug washout) n=3 
Upon uptake of FTD in NUGC-3 and MCF-7 cells, the amount of FTD uptake into DNA was much greater than that 
of the other nucleosides, Ara-C, dFdC and FdUrd (study M01-2006-0025).  
In vivo studies 
The antitumor efficacy of oral administration (twice daily) and continuous infusion (osmotic pump) of FTD for 14 
days in MX-1 human breast cancer xenografted nude mice was evaluated in study 11TA03. Approximately one 
month after inoculation, 2 mm fragments of tumour were excised and subcutaneously implanted into the right 
chest of male BALB/cAJclnu/ nu mice. Groups were formed such that mean tumour volume (TV) between groups 
was equal. Then administration with either TAS-102 or its anti-tumour component FTD or a comparator followed 
for 14 or 28 days. Relative tumour volume (RTV) was calculated from each calculated tumour volume (TV) 
calculated on certain days (n) The inhibition rate of tumour growth (IR) was calculated from the RTV most often 
at Day 15. RTV and IR were calculated using the following formulas:  RTVn = (TV on Day n) / (TV on Day 0) and 
IR (%) = [1-(mean RTV15 of treatment group) / (mean RTV15 of control group)] × 100. As indicator for toxicity, 
changes in body weight (reductions of >20 %) were taken. 
A comparison of the RTV between the oral administration group and the continuous infusion group showed that 
oral administration resulted in significantly higher anti-tumour efficacy (p<0.01). Oral administration of FTD 
seems to be superior to continuous infusion, confirming the validity of oral administration 
The anti-tumour efficacy between once daily and twice daily oral administration of TAS-102 for 14 days in MX-1 
human breast cancer xenografted nude mice was evaluated in study 11TA04 . The anti-tumour efficacy of 
TAS-102 is higher when the compound is given as a divided daily dose compared to a single dose in human 
breast tumour MX-1 xenografts in nude mice, suggesting that administration of TAS-102 using a divided-dosing 
regimen may result in greater efficacy. 
The effective dose levels of TAS-102 that could be administered to substantially reduce the growth of human 
gastric carcinoma SC-2 xenografts in nude mice were determined in study 20061-003. Tumour volume 
reduction following treatment with TAS-102 (500 mg/kg/day) was associated with significant toxicity (23.5% 
EMA/CHMP/287846/2016 
Page 21/106 
  
  
  
 
weight loss) at Day 15. In comparison, weight loss following treatment with 250 mg/kg/day was circa 5%, 
suggesting that the optimum dose level of TAS-102 against SC-2 human gastric cancer xenografts in nude mice 
lies between 250 and 500 mg/kg/day. 
In nude mice bearing intraperitoneally implanted human colon adenocarcinoma (KM20C) tumours, TAS-102 
showed superior prolongation of survival compared with CPT-11 and S-1-treated mice (28 days) bearing human 
colon adenocarcinoma (KM20C) xenografts (study 11TA05). These findings suggest that TAS-102 may be 
effective in prolonging survival of advanced and recurrent colorectal cancer in patients.   
In mice bearing human colon cancer (KM20C), human breast cancer (MC-2) and human lung cancer (Lu-134) 
xenografts, treatment with TAS-102 (150 mg/kg/day, b.i.d.) for 14 consecutive days, showed significant (p < 
0.01) anti-tumour activity against all three tested human cancer xenografts in nude mice (study 03-09-008). TP 
expression was observed in KM20C, MC-2, and Lu-134 tumours, with the highest expression in MC-2 tumours.  
Figure 5: Expression levels of TP in human KM20C, MC-2 or Lu-134 tumor cells (all n=3/group) 
However, whilst TP was expressed in all three tumour types investigated, TPI showed no anti-tumour efficacy in 
this study, suggesting that TPI acts solely as a modulator to inhibit the degradation of FTD (the TAS-102 
effector) in blood, with little or no direct involvement in the anti-tumour efficacy of TAS-102. MC-2 and Lu-134 
human xenografts in nude mice seem to be more effectively inhibited by TAS-102 in comparison to KM20C 
human xenograft. 
The anti-tumour effect of TAS- 102 on the human colon cancer-derived cell line COL-1 and the mutant 
KRAS-containing cell line HCT-116 was evaluated in nude mice bearing subcutaneously implanted tumours 
(study 11TA01). TAS-102 is more effective than cetuximab on cetuximab insensitive colorectal cancer xenograft 
in nude mice, which may suggest that TAS-102 will be effective in treating patients with progressive, recurrent 
colorectal cancer and KRAS mutations that do not respond to cetuximab.

The anti-tumour activity of TAS-102 and TS-1 against MX-1 human breast cancer xenografts in nude mice was 
evaluated in study 11TA02. The IR of the TAS-102 (150 mg/kg/day) treated group was 64.3 % and of the TS-1 
(8.3 mg/kg/day) treated group 10.5%. Compared to control, both TAS-102 and TS-1 produced significant

anti-tumour activity (RTV), which was significantly higher for TAS-102 over TS-1 against MX- 1 human breast 
cancer xenografts in this model. 
A correlation analysis between the anti-tumour efficacy of TAS-102 in vivo and the amount of FTD incorporated 
into DNA was conducted (study 03-12-003). The high degree of association (R2 = 0.84) between the 
anti-tumour efficacy of TAS-102 and the amount of FTD incorporated into DNA confirms incorporation of FTD 
into DNA as the main effector mechanism for the anti-tumour activity of TAS-102.

g DNA) on Day 7, in mice subcutaneously implanted with various human-derived tumour cell lines 
(table) and the correlation between these two (graph) 
The mechanism(s) underlying the anti-tumour efficacy of TAS-102 were investigated by means of transcription 
analysis using mice bearing subcutaneously implanted KM20C human colon tumour xenografts (study 
EMA/CHMP/287846/2016 
Page 23/106 
  
  
  
 
 
 
03-12-012). On the basis of a transcription study in cells from mice bearing KM20C tumour and treated with 
TAS-102, it is suggested that the decreased expression of genes under control of TBP observed following 
TAS-102 administration could be attributable to the incorporation of FTD into A-T-rich promoter regions, thus 
influencing the interactions between DNA and transcription factors 
Which TBP regulated genes are expressed to a lesser extent in tumours inhibited by TAS-102 and how decrease 
in expression of these genes leads to tumour inhibition is not unravelled. This lack of information will not 
influence the benefit/risk balance of this product.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The applicant has conducted receptor screening studies for FTD, FTY and TPI at concentrations of 10μM.  
No significant interaction between FTD, TPI, FTY and different receptors, enzymes and channels tested has been 
reported up to the tested concentration of 10μM, which is in excess of the free maximum concentration of FTD, 
FTY and TPI in human serum upon dosing with Lonsurf according to the clinical dosing regimen. It can thus be 
anticipated that no secondary pharmacological effects will occur.

Effects on CNS, respiratory and cardiovascular systems have been studied in rat and monkey for TAS-102, FTD 
and TPI. Effect of FTD and TPI on hERG current has been studied in HEK293T cells.  
Oral administration of TAS-102 at dose levels of up to 435 mg/kg of FTD, or TPI at dose levels of up to 2000 
mg/kg produced no treatment related behavioural, physiological, body temperature changes or respiratory 
parameters in the rat when compared to the vehicle treated group (studies B040836, B061097, B050588, 
B040837, B061098 and B050587). 
Oral administration of TAS-102 at dose levels of up to 108.8 mg/kg of FTD and oral administration of TPI at dose 
levels of up to 1000 mg/kg produced no effects on cardiovascular parameters in the conscious monkey (studies 
B040835, B061099 and B050589). 
The effect of FTD was assessed in vitro on the peak hERG tail current recorded from a HEK293 cell line stably 
expressing the hERG (human ether a go go related gene) potassium channel (studies B050268 or B050270). 
FTD is considered to have no effect on hERG current at concentrations up to 300 µmol/L (88.86 mg/L) and TPI 
is considered to have no effect on hERG current at concentrations up to 100 μmol/L (24.3 mg/L). Human Cmax 
for FTD is 4.8 mg/L and for TPI 0.068 mg/L.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
The inhibitory effects of FTD on cell proliferation when used concomitantly with dThd analog-type antiviral drugs 
in  vitro  were  determined  in  study  03-13-004.  None  of  the  tested  zidovudine  (AZT),  stavudine  (d4T)  or 
EMA/CHMP/287846/2016

telbivudine (LdT) influenced the inhibitory action of FTD on cell growth at clinically relevant concentration with 
HCT116 and NUGC-3 cancer cell lines. Zidovudine (AZT) attenuated the cell growth inhibitory effects of FTD, 
mainly at near clinical concentration of AZT. This would suggest that the possibility that the anti-tumour effects 
of Lonsurf could be attenuated when AZT is used concomitantly in clinical practice. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Single dose pharmacokinetics were studied in mice, rats and monkeys. Tissue distribution was studied in rats. 
Metabolism and excretion were studied in rats and monkeys. 
Analytical methods 
In toxicokinetic studies, FTD, FTY and TPI in plasma were measured by LC-MS/MS methods in rats, by HPLC-UV 
methods in dogs and by LC-MS/MS or HPLC-UV in monkeys. The methods were sufficiently validated. 
FTD 
Absorption 
Based on excretion in urine and expired air and in rats also bile, at least 77% and 79% of FTD was absorbed in 
rat and monkey respectively. After oral administration, Tmax of FTD was similar among animal species (mouse 
0.17 – 0.33 h, rat 0.25 – 0.5 h, monkey 0.9 – 1.5 h) and slightly longer in humans (1.3 – 2.1 h), indicating rapid 
absorption. FTD was rapidly metabolised into FTY (Tmax after oral administration mouse 0.33 – 2 h, rat 1 h, 
monkey 1.1 – 1.8 h, human 2.0 – 2.7 h). Absorption in humans appears much lower than in rats and monkeys, 
based on low excretion of FTD + metabolites in urine and low membrane permeability in Caco-2 cells. 
Oral bioavailability of FTD (administered without TPI) was low (3.0% in monkeys) due to a high first-pass effect. 
The exposure to FTD (based on AUC(0-inf) increased 2.5 times in mice and 100 times in monkeys due to the 
co-administration with TPI. Molar ratios for FTD/TPI of 1:1 and 1:0.5 provided a significantly higher exposure to 
FTD in monkeys than a ratio of 1:0.2.  
Elimination half-life of FTD was short, 0.21 h in rats and 0.22 h in monkeys following IV administration. In mice, 
conversion into FTY was too quick to determine a half-life for FTD. In humans, half-life was also short (1.4 – 1.7 
h following oral administration). 
Vd and CL were only provided for monkeys. CL/F was much higher for FTD alone (44.4 L/h/kg) than for FTD 
combined with TPI (0.35 L/h/kg), probably due to the fast conversion of FTD to FTY when FTD is administered 
without TPI. Vd/F for FTD alone (20.7 L/kg) was higher than total body water. Vd/F for FTD combined with TPI 
(0.585 L/kg) was lower than total body water.  
Repeated  dose  plasma  pharmacokinetics  studies  were  not  performed.  Toxicokinetic  studies  showed  no 
consistent  gender  effects  in  the  exposure  to  FTD  and  FTY  in  rats  and  monkeys.  Exposure  to  FTD  increased 
approximately dose-proportionally at lower doses and less than dose-proportionally at higher doses in rats and 
monkeys. Exposure to FTD and FTY in rats showed some potential for accumulation following repeated dosing. 
In monkeys, no effect was observed from repeated dosing. 
Distribution 
Plasma protein binding of FTD was 83%, 72%, 45%, 91% and 97% in mouse, rat, dog, cynomolgus monkey and 
human. The high protein binding for humans compared to the animal species provides extra safety margins: 
factor 5.7 for the mouse, 9.3 for the rat, 18 for the dog, and 3.0 for the monkey at clinical concentrations. 
EMA/CHMP/287846/2016 
Page 25/106 
  
  
  
In blood of rats, cynomolgus monkeys and humans, 14C-FTD did not distribute to blood to a significant extent, 
at  clinically  relevant  concentrations  (blood/plasma  ratios  were  around  0.6  –  0.8  in  vitro  and  comparable  or 
slightly higher in vivo). 
14C-FTD was found at the highest concentrations in large intestine, urine in bladder, uveal tract, bone marrow, 
and thymus. Low concentrations were found in the brain. The reliability of this study is however limited because 
measurements were started several hours after the plasma peak and because total radioactivity was measured, 
which at 4 h after dosing consisted mainly of FTY. There was no evidence of significant binding to melanin. 
FTD and metabolites distributed to rat foetal tissues in substantial amounts. At 48 h after dosing, still substantial 
amounts remained. FTD (including metabolites) was excreted in milk of rats. 
Metabolism 
In  vitro  studies:  FTD  was  not  metabolized  by  human  liver  microsomes.  FTD  was  metabolized  into  FTY 
(44.5-92.3%  of  the  total  radioactive  peak  area)  and  5-CU  (2.1-7.8%  of  total  radioactive  peak  area)  by 
cryopreserved human hepatocytes. 5-CdUrd was formed non-enzymatically (0.0-2.3% of total radioactive peak 
area).  FTD  was  primarily  metabolized  by  thymidine  phosphorylase.  Published  in  vitro  data  indicate  that  the 
metabolism of FTD into FTY s not inhibited by TPI in dogs. 
In  vivo studies: In rats,  monkeys and  humans FTY is the major metabolite. In plasma of rats, also a  minor 
unknown  metabolite  was  found.  Urine  excretion  data  in  rats  treated  with  radio-labelled  TAS-102  vs 
radio-labelled FTD indicate that metabolism of FTD into FTY is inhibited by TPI in rats, though to a limited extent. 
In  plasma  of  monkeys,  also  hydrolysed  FTY  and  glucuronides  of  FTD  were  found,  as  well  as  other  minor 
metabolites. In humans, 5-CU and 5-CdUrd are minor metabolites. These were not found in plasma of rats or 
monkeys. This is however not a problem, as they are only very minor metabolites in humans. 
Excretion 
Excretion of radioactivity following the oral administration of 14C-FTD to non-fasted male rats in urine, faeces, 
expired air and bile was 61%, 21%, 16% and 0.4% respectively. Considering the low excretion in bile, excretion 
in faeces probably mainly consisted of unabsorbed dose. In cynomolgus monkeys, 79% of radioactivity was 
excreted in urine following the oral administration of 14C-FTD. Excretion in faeces was 4%. Excretion was almost 
complete in 7 days. In humans, 1.5% of the administered dose of TAS-102 was excreted as unchanged FTD in 
urine and 21.0% of the administered dose was excreted as unchanged FTD + metabolites, which is much lower 
than in rats and monkeys. Excretion in faeces was not determined in humans. 
TPI 
Absorption 
Based on excretion in urine and expired air and in rats also bile, approximately 15-24% and 27% of TPI was 
absorbed  in  rat  and  monkey  respectively.  In  rats,  absorption  was  19%  based  on  the  ratio  of  AUCs  of  total 
radioactivity following oral and IV administration. After oral administration, Tmax of TPI was short in mice and 
rats (0.33 h and 0.5 – 1 h resp.) and slightly longer in monkeys and humans (2.3 h and 2.3 – 3.5 h resp.), 
indicating rapid absorption. 
Bioavailability of TPI was low in rats (9%), probably mainly due to the low absorption. 
Elimination half-life of TPI following IV administration was approximately 1.5 h in rats. Half-life following oral 
administration was 2.4 – 3.5 h in mouse and 1.8 h in monkey (no half-life after IV administration available in 
these species). This was similar to humans (1.7 – 2.2 h).  
EMA/CHMP/287846/2016 
Page 26/106 
  
  
  
CL/F was higher in the mouse (73.3 – 73.7 L/h/kg) than in the monkey (2.14 L/h/kg). Vd/F was high in the 
mouse and far beyond total body water (258 – 372 L/kg). Vd/F in the monkey was 5.56 L/kg which was higher 
than total body water. 
Toxicokinetic studies showed no consistent gender effect in rats except at the highest dose (2000 mg/kg/day) 
where exposure was higher in females. In monkeys, no consistent gender effect was visible after treatment with 
TAS-102. After administration of TPI alone (at higher doses than in the studies with TAS-102), exposure was 
lower in female monkeys than in males. Exposure to TPI increased approximately dose-proportionally in rats 
after administration of TAS-102 and less than dose-proportionally in the study with administration of TPI alone 
(at higher doses than in the studies with TAS-102). Exposure to TPI increased less than dose-proportionally in 
monkeys. There was no evidence of accumulation or induction of TPI in rats and monkeys. 
Distribution 
Plasma protein binding of TPI was low, 5.5%, 1.9%, 3.1%, 3.0% and 7.1% in mouse, rat, dog, cynomolgus 
monkey and human. 
In blood of rats, cynomolgus monkeys and humans, 14C-TPI did not distribute to blood to a significant extent, at 
clinically relevant concentrations (blood/plasma ratios were around 0.6 – 0.8 in vitro and comparable or slightly 
higher in vivo). 
14C-TPI was mainly found in large intestine, small intestine and liver. There was no distribution of TPI to the brain. 
The  reliability  of  this  study  is  however  limited  because  measurements  were  started  several  hours  after  the 
plasma peak. There was no evidence of significant binding to melanin. 
TPI and metabolites were distributed to rat fetal tissues in small quantities. TPI (including metabolites) was 
excreted in milk of rats.  
Metabolism 
In vitro studies: TPI was not metabolized by rat and human liver S9 or by cryopreserved human hepatocytes. 
In vivo studies: 6-hydroxymethyluracil (6-HMU) was the main metabolite of TPI in rats. In monkeys, uracil was 
an important metabolite. The parent compound was also an important component in monkey plasma. There 
were also other metabolites in plasma of monkeys which were not further identified. In humans, no metabolites 
of TPI were found in plasma except that 6-HMU was found at very low amounts. 6-HMU was also found in rats. 
There are therefore no unique human metabolites of TPI.  
Excretion 
Excretion of radioactivity following the oral administration of 14C-TPI to non-fasted male rats in urine, faeces, 
expired air and bile was 14-24%, 68-83%, 0.4% and 0.2% respectively. Considering the low excretion in bile, 
excretion in faeces probably mainly consisted of unabsorbed dose. Following the oral administration of 14C-TPI 
to monkeys, 27% of radioactivity was excreted in urine and 68% in faeces. Excretion was complete in 7 days. 
In humans, approximately 29% of the administered dose of TPI was excreted in urine in its unchanged form, 
which is higher than in rats and monkeys. Excretion in faeces was not determined in humans. 
FTD and TPI 
Based on plasma pharmacokinetics and metabolism, rat and monkey are suitable animal species for the pivotal 
toxicology studies. Dog would have been a less suitable species because FTD metabolism is not inhibited by TPI 
in dogs. 
EMA/CHMP/287846/2016 
Page 27/106 
  
  
  
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
In vitro studies with human biomaterials showed no evidence that trifluridine, FTY and tipiracil are metabolized 
by  the  CYP  enzymes  tested  (CYP1A2,  CYP2A6,  CYP2B6,  CYP2C8,  CYP2C9,  CYP2C19,  CYP2D6,  CYP2E1  and 
CYP3A4/5). In vitro evaluation indicated that trifluridine and FTY had no inductive effect on human CYP1A2, 
CYP2B6 or CYP3A4/5 suggesting that neither trifluridine, FTY, nor tipiracil would cause, or be affected by, a 
CYP-mediated drug interaction.  
In  vitro  evaluation  of  trifluridine  and  tipiracil  hydrochloride  was  conducted  using  human  uptake  and  efflux 
transporters (trifluridine with MDR1, OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and BCRP; tipiracil hydrochloride with OAT1, OAT3, 
OCT2, MATE1, MDR1 and BCRP). Neither trifluridine nor tipiracil hydrochloride was an inhibitor of or substrate 
for  human  uptake  and  efflux  transporters  based  on  in  vitro  studies,  except  for  OCT2  and  MATE1.  Tipiracil 
hydrochloride was an inhibitor of OCT2 and MATE1 in vitro.

Genotoxicity 
TAS-102 and FTD scored positive in all three pivotal genotoxicity assays, with and without metabolic activation 
and are therefore considered genotoxic. TPI scored negative in all three pivotal genotoxicity assays, with or 
without metabolic activation and is therefore considered not genotoxic.  
Carcinogenicity 
In accordance with ICH S9, no carcinogenicity studies have been performed. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
The effect on fertility and reproduction of TAS-102 were performed in accordance with ICH M3(R2). Fertility in 
male  and  female  Sprague-Dawley  rat  was  not  affected  up  to  a  dose  of  450  and  150  mg/kg/day  TAS-102, 
respectively. In a 2-week repeated dose study, 450 mg/kg/day FTD alone was observed to induce atrophy of 
seminiferous  tubules,  decreased  sperm,  increased  cellular  debris  in  epididymis  tubules,  swelling  of  liver 
sinusoidal lining cells. These effects are expected due to the mechanism of action of FTD. Effects are observed

at systemic concentrations below the human recommended dose.  
TAS-102  induced  teratogenicity  and  embryo  foetal  mortality  at  150  mg/kg/day  and  impaired  embryo-foetal 
growth  in  absence  of  maternal  toxicity  at  50  mg/kg/day.  Developmental  toxicity  is  expected  due  to  the 
mechanism of action of TAS-102 and is observed in animals at a concentration lower than the human intended 
dose. 
No peri- and postnatal toxicology studies have been performed.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Lonsurf or TAS-102 is a combination of trifluridine (FTD) and tipiracil hydrochloride (TPI). FTD is an 
antineoplastic thymidine-based nucleoside analogue, which is incorporated into deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in 
tumour cells following phosphorylation and metabolism.  
TPI inhibits degradation of FTD by inhibiting thymidine phosphorylase (TPase), thus increasing systemic 
exposure to FTD when FTD and TPI are given together. This pharmacodynamic action follows from data 
submitted in the pharmokinetic part of the dossier.  
In vitro evaluation indicated that trifluridine and FTY had no inductive effect on human CYP1A2, CYP2B6 or 
CYP3A4/5. Thus trifluridine is not expected to cause or be subject to a significant medicinal product interaction 
mediated by CYP. In the in vitro induction study evaluating the inductive effect of tipiracil on human CYP 
isoforms, the concentration of tipiracil in the study was too low to investigate the potential induction in intestinal 
cells. Inductive effect of tipiracil on human CYP isoforms cannot be excluded (see section 5.2 of the SmPC). The 
applicant is recommended to further investigate the potential induction of intestinal CYP3A4 by tipiracil at 
relevant concentrations. 
Tipiracil hydrochloride was an inhibitor of OCT2 and MATE1 in vitro, but at concentrations substantially higher 
than human plasma Cmax at steady state. Thus it is unlikely to cause an interaction with other medicinal 
products, at recommended doses, due to inhibition of OCT2 and MATE1. Transport of tipiracil hydrochloride by 
OCT2 and MATE1 might be affected when Lonsurf is administered concomitantly with inhibitors of OCT2 and 
MATE1. 
Humans exposed to single dose of FTD have AUC of 7120-10082 ng.h/ml and when exposed to a single dose of 
TPI have an AUC of 302-392 ng.h/ml. Doses tested in Safety pharmacology studies resulted in more than 5 
times higher exposure than human exposure, thus dose levels are regarded to be sufficiently high.  
EMA/CHMP/287846/2016 
Page 34/106 
  
  
  
It can be anticipated from the conducted secondary pharmacology screen that no secondary pharmacological 
effects will occur in human upon dosing with Lonsurf according to the clinical dosing regimen. 
Toxicology  assessment  of  trifluridine/tipiracil  hydrochloride  was  performed  in  rats,  dogs  and  monkeys.  The 
target  organs  identified  were  the  lymphatic  and  haematopoietic  systems  and  the  gastrointestinal  tract.  All 
changes,  i.e.,  leucopenia,  anaemia,  bone  marrow  hypoplasia,  atrophic  changes  in  the  lymphatic  and 
haematopoietic tissues and the gastrointestinal tract, were reversible within 9 weeks of drug withdrawal. The 
fact that a large relative portion of the drug is taken up into DNA may contribute to the MoA, which may also 
explain observed toxicity effects in GI tract and the hematopoietic system consisting of rapidly dividing cells. 
Whitening,  breakage,  and  malocclusion  were  observed  in  teeth  of  rats  treated  with  trifluridine/tipiracil 
hydrochloride, which are considered rodent specific and not relevant for human (see section 5.3 of the SmPC). 
Corrected for protein binding, exposure to FTD when given TAS-102 in rat and monkeys at the NOAEL was, 
respectively, 0.03-0.16 times and 0.06-0.2 times the exposure in humans at the intended dose. 
Dogs appear to be very sensitive to TAS-102 and FTD. Target organs affected by TAS-102 in dogs are similar 
compared  to  those  affected  in  rat  and  monkey,  however,  adverse  effects  in  dogs  seem  to  be  more  severe 
compared  to  rat  and  monkey.  Corrected  for  protein  binding,  exposure  to  FTD  by  TAS-102  in  dog  at  17 
mg/kg/day is ca. 4x higher than in human at the recommended dose.  However, 17 mg/kg/day is not the NOAEL. 
In the repeated dose study with FTD in dogs, the NOAEL was established at 2 mg/kg/day, which corresponded 
to a safety factor of 0.004. Corrected for protein binding, the safety factor is 0.07. Although the Applicant does 
not discuss the increased sensitivity of dogs to TAS-102, the dog can be regarded as a too sensitive model in 
view of scientific relevance and animal welfare.  
In rat, the type of adverse effects observed after FTD exposure alone were similar, but more severe compared 
to TAS-102. Furthermore, FTD levels were 2x lower in FTD exposure alone compared to TAS-102 exposure. Also 
in dog, at comparable levels of FTD, adverse effects observed after FTD exposure alone were more severe than 
after exposure to TAS-102.  The cause of more severe effects observed in rat and dog at a similar or lower AUC 
after FTD exposure compared to TAS-102 is not clear, but may be related to relatively high scatter in AUC-data. 
After  one  week  exposure,  at  a  dose  of  25  mg/kg/day  FTD  in  TAS-102,  adverse  toxicological  effects  were 
observed in the monkey, whereas no effects were observed after treatment with FTD alone. This is due to the 
decreasing metabolization of FTD by TPI in TAS-102 as the concentration ratio FTD:FTY is 1:50 in FTD exposure 
alone (based on Cmax) and 4:1 in TAS-102 (based on concentration 2 hours after exposure). Due to absence of 
any effect in the one month monkey study, FTD was tested in one monkey at 100 and 150 mg/kg/day, which 
proved to be lethal. In our opinion, it was not necessary to perform a subsequent study in monkey, as severe 
toxicity was already established in the study with one monkey. The added value of the additional study in light 
of scientific relevance and animal welfare is therefore highly questioned.  
In rat and monkey models, at similar doses of FTD, less FTY metabolite was formed after exposure to TAS-102 
compared to FTD alone, whereas in dog, no difference in FTY formation was observed between exposure to FTD 
alone and TAS-102. This indicates the intended mechanism of action of TPI is observed in rat and monkey, but 
not in dog. 
Animal: human exposure multiples corrected for protein binding were less than 1 for FTD after exposure to 
TAS-102 and FTD, whereas the major metabolite FTY was below 1 only in monkey after exposure to TAS-102. 
TPI was found not to induce adverse effects at exposure multiples of at least 11x. As adverse effects induced by 
FTD are part of its mechanism of action, the low exposure multiples after treatment with TAS-102 in monkeys 
may be of relevance for the human situation.

No long term studies evaluating the carcinogenic potential of trifluridine/tipiracil hydrochloride in animals have 
been performed. Trifluridine was shown to be genotoxic in a reverse mutation test in bacteria, a chromosomal 
aberration test in mammal-cultured cells, and a micronucleus test in mice. Therefore, Lonsurf should be treated 
as a potential carcinogen (see section 5.3 of the SmPC). 
Results of animal studies did not indicate an effect of trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride on male and female 
fertility in rats. The increases in the corpus luteum count and implanting embryo count observed in female rats 
at high doses were not considered adverse). Lonsurf has been shown to cause embryo-foetal lethality and 
embryo-foetal toxicity in pregnant rats when given at dose levels lower than the clinical exposure. No 
peri/post-natal developmental toxicity studies have been performed. 
Trifluridine may cause foetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Women should avoid becoming 
pregnant while taking Lonsurf and for up to 6 months after ending treatment. Therefore, women of child-bearing 
potential must use highly effective contraceptive measures while taking Lonsurf and for 6 months after stopping 
treatment. It is currently unknown whether Lonsurf may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives, 
and therefore women using hormonal contraceptives should add a barrier contraceptive method. Male patients 
should be using effective contraception during treatment and for up to 6 months after discontinuation of 
treatment.  
It is unknown whether Lonsurf or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Studies in animals have shown 
excretion of trifluridine, tipiracil hydrochloride and/or their metabolites in milk. A risk to the suckling child cannot 
be excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Lonsurf (see sections 4.6 and 5.3 of 
the SmPC). 
The absence of local tolerance studies was considered acceptable as the clinical route of administration of 
TAS-102 is oral, and histopathological evaluation of the tongue, oesophagus and gastro-intestinal tract were 
assessed as part of the repeated dose toxicity studies. 
Trifluridine and Tipiracil are both considered not to be a PBT or vPvB substance.  
The refined PECsw is 0.002 and 0.0009 µg/L for trifluridine and tipiracil, respectively. This is below the action 
limit of 0.01 µg/L. Therefore, a Phase II assessment is not warranted for trifluridine and tipiracil . 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical data submitted are considered sufficient to support the evaluation of the benefit risk of Lonsurf.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The clinical pharmacology program has been conducted for TAS-102 in patients with advanced solid tumours, 
and in patients with metastatic CRC. Given the anti-neoplastic character of trifluridine, no studies have been 
conducted in healthy volunteers. 
The clinical pharmacology program consisted of basic pharmacokinetic (single- and multiple-dose, absorption, 
distribution, metabolism, and excretion, drug-drug interaction, food effect and relative bioavailability, and 
pharmacokinetics in Japanese and Caucasian patients) properties of trifluridine and tipiracil in patients with 
advanced solid tumours or metastatic CRC, population PK analysis, exposure-effect relationships in patients, 
exposure QTc relationships in patients. Additionally, in vitro studies with human biomaterials were performed in 
order to assess the potential of trifluridine and tipiracil to act either as a substrate, inhibitor, or inducer of drug 
metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters. 
Ongoing or planned studies include studies to evaluate the PK of Lonsurf components/metabolites in patients 
with renal impairment (TO-TAS-102-107) and hepatic impairment (TO-TAS-102-106), a Phase I 
dose-escalating, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic study of TAS-102 with CPT-11 in patients with 
advanced gastrointestinal tumours (TPU-TAS-102-109), a Phase I, open-label, non-randomised, 
pharmacokinetic study of TAS-102 in Chinese patients with solid tumours (10040100), a randomized, 
EMA/CHMP/287846/2016

double-blind, Phase III Study of TAS-102 versus placebo in Asian (China, South Korea and Thailand) patients 
with metastatic CRC refractory or intolerable to standard chemotherapies (10040090), and an open-label 
expanded access Phase IIIb study of TAS-102 in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer refractory to or 
failing standard chemotherapy (TO-TAS-102-401). A study to assess the mass balance of orally administered 
trifluridine and tipiracil as components of TAS-102 (TPU-TAS-102-108) was submitted during the procedure. 
Methods 
The plasma and urine concentrations of the parent compound trifluridine, its major metabolite 5 
trifluoromethyluracil (FTY), and tipiracil were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry 
(LC/MS/MS) after administration of TAS-102. Analytical methods for trifluridine (and its metabolites) and 
tipiracil were adequately validated. 
PopPK analysis  
The structural model for trifluridine was a 1-compartment disposition model with transit absorption model 
(nt=4). A covariance structure for the IIV between Vd/F and CL/F was included in the base and final model.  
The structural model for tipiracil was a two-compartment disposition model with transit absorption model 
(nt=4). A covariance structure for the IIV between Vd/F and CL/F was included in the base and final model. 
In the popPK model no single dose data have been included in the model. Single dose data were not included 
because the 3-fold increase in trifluridine could not be modelled according to the applicant and the multiple dose 
data were considered more relevant for correlation with efficacy and safety. Sufficient PK rich data set was 
available following multiple dosing to develop a popPK model. 
Goodness-of-fit plots for population was not impressive but the popPK model predicted the individual plasma 
concentration reasonably well; there is underestimation of the higher concentrations of trifluridine and tipiracil 
and some overestimation of the lower concentrations. VCP plots and individual overlay plots confirmed that 
plasma samples were sufficiently well predicted although the exposure in subjects with slow absorption was less 
well predicted. Vd/F, CL/F, MTT parameters seem to be estimated with acceptable precision because their 
relative standard errors (%) and shrinkages (%), and residual errors were below 30%.  
Absorption  
Following Lonsurf administration, trifluridine and tipiracil are rapidly absorbed with mean Tmax values of 1-2 
hours for trifluridine and 2-3.5 hours for tipiracil. At day 12 of cycle 1, treatment with TAS-102 35 
mg/m2 resulted in mean trifluridine AUC values ranging from 20950 and 24546 ng*h/ml, Cmax from 4752 and 
5548 ng/ml for studies  in Japanese as well as Caucasian patients (J001-10040010, TAS-102-102, and 
TAS-102-103). Mean tipiracil AUC values varied between 317-382 ng*h/ml and mean Cmax between 69 and 79 
ng/ml. 
No absolute bioavailability study has been conducted with TAS-102 to evaluate the oral bioavailability of 
trifluridine and tipiracil. Absorption of trifluridine is estimated >57% to almost complete and >27% but <50% 
for tipiracil based on urinary and fecal excretion of trifluridine related compounds and tipiracil related 
compounds in the mass balance study TAS-102-108.  
Trifluridine and tipiracil are high soluble, i.e., 60 mg/ml and 120 mg/ml, respectively, in aqueous solutions over 
pH range pH 1.2-7.5. Based on the estimated absorption from the mass balance study and the high solubility, 
trifluridine and tipiracil are classified as BCS class 3 substances.

Permeability of trifluridine in Caco-2 was concentration dependent, more pronounced in the B-A direction and 
was affected by inhibitors verapamil and 2,4-dinitrophenol. These results indicate the involvement of 
transporter in bidirectional fluxes of trifluridine across Caco-2 cell monolayers.  
Bioavailability 
Trifluridine is rapidly degraded by intestinal and liver thymidine phosphorylase (thymidine phosphorylase). 
Tipiracil is an inhibitor of thymidine phosphorylase.  Study TAS-102-102evaluated the effect of tipiracil on the 
bioavailability of trifluridine at a TAS-102 dose of 35 mg/m2. Trifluridine AUC was 37-fold higher following 
administration of TAS-102 than following administration of trifluridine alone. The trifluridine Cmax was 22-fold 
higher for TAS-102 compared to trifluridine alone. These findings support the contribution of tipiracil, in the 
combination of trifluridine and tipiracil (Lonsurf). 
Figure 7. Mean trifluridine Plasma Concentrations Time Profile after Single Dose of TAS-102 or 
trifluridine Alone (Study TAS-102-102) 
Study TAS-102-104 evaluated the relative bioavailability of TAS-102 tablets compared to an oral solution in 
patients with advanced solid tumours. Bioavailability of trifluridine and tipiracil was comparable following 
TAS-102 60 mg administration as tablets or solution.   
Food 
The effect of a high-fat, high-calorie meal on the pharmacokinetics of trifluridine and tipiracil was studied in 
Study J004-10040040. Trifluridine area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) did not change, but 
trifluridine Cmax, tipiracil hydrochloride Cmax and AUC decreased by approximately 40% compared to those in a 
fasting state.

Distribution 
The  blood/plasma  concentration  ratios  for  trifluridine  and  tipiracil  were  0.6  over  the  concentration  range  of 
0.5-50 μg/mL for trifluridine and 0.010- 1 µg/mL of tipiracil (Study 11DA34), indicating that in human blood, 
trifluridine and tipiracil are distributed mainly in the plasma fraction. 
The plasma protein binding of trifluridine and tipiracil in human serum was determined by ultrafiltration methods 
(studies  AE-2350-2G  and  AE-2350-3G).  The  plasma  protein  binding  for  trifluridine  was  high  (96%)  and 
independent  of  the  concentration  0.5-50  μg/mL;  trifluridine  was  primarily  bound  to  HSA.  The  extent  of 
trifluridine binding to plasma protein was not affected by the presence of other albumin-bound drugs (Study No. 
12DA05) or tipiracil. Trifluridine did not displace the albumin-bound drug warfarin in human plasma (Study No. 
12DA05).    Plasma  protein  binding  for  tipiracil  was  low  (<8%)  over  the  concentration  range  0.05-  5  μg/mL. 
Tipiracil is a substrate for OCT2 and MATE1 transporters (studies 09DB12 and 12DB11, data not shown). These 
transporters can be involved in the elimination of tipiracil in urine. 
A potential drug interaction caused by plasma protein displacement is low. In the mass balance study using 
a 14C-trifluridine, > 90% of radioactive material could be recovered from plasma at 2 hours after dosing, but the 
recovery declined to < 1% at 96 hours and later time points indicating covalent binding of trifluridine related 
substance with proteins.  
Trifluridine is a substrate for nucleoside transporters CNT1, ENT1 and ENT2 (Takahashi K, 2015; Sakamoto K, 
2015) which may be involved in the absorption and distribution of trifluridine. 
Volume of distribution and oral clearance of trifluridine and tipiracil across studies are summarised in the table 
below.

Elimination 
Following a single dose of Lonsurf (35 mg/m2) in patients with advanced solid tumours, the oral clearance (CL/F) 
for trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride were 10.5 L/hr and 109 L/hr, respectively. 
The estimated apparent systemic trifluridine CL/F was 2.9 L/h at day 12 of a treatment cycle (popPK analysis).  
The estimated tipiracil CL/F following multiple dosing was 88.7 L/h for a typical cancer patient (popPK analysis).  
Following the multiple-dose administration of Lonsurf at the recommended dose and regimen, the mean 
elimination half-life (t 1/2) for trifluridine on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and on Day 12 of Cycle 1 were 1.4 hours and 2.1 
hours, respectively.  The mean t 1/2 values for tipiracil hydrochloride on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and on Day 12 of Cycle 
1 were 2.1 hours and 2.4 hours, respectively. 
Metabolism 
In vitro studies showed that trifluridine and tipiracil are not metabolized by CYP enzymes. It was demonstrated 
that trifluridine is primarily metabolized by thymidine phosphorylase.  
In  the  mass  balance  study,  trifluridine  and  FTY  were  the  major  circulating  moieties  with  53%  and  33%, 
respectively, of extractable radioactivity. No other peaks greater than 5% of radioactive material were detected. 
In  urine,  53%  -  57%  of  the  administered  dose  was  excreted  as  trifluridine  related  compounds:  ~1%  as 
unchanged trifluridine, ~25% as FTY, ~18% as 2 trifluridine-glucuronide isomers. Other minor metabolites, 5 
carboxyuracil and 5-carboxy-2’-deoxyuridine, were detected, but those levels in plasma and urine were at low 
or trace levels. 
TPI is a specific inhibitor of TPase and consequently an inhibitor of the metabolism of trifluridine in the intestinal 
tract and liver. Due to the low absorption of tipiracil, its activity might be focus in the intestinal tract. In the mass 
balance study, 6-HMU was the only major metabolite of tipiracil in plasma, urine and faeces: plasma 
radioactivity consisted of 30.9% 6-HMU and 53.1% tipiracil, radioactivity in urine consisted of 14.0% 6-HMU and 
79.1% tipiracil, and the faecal radioactivity consisted of 34.4% 6-HMU and 48.2% tipiracil. 6-HMU appeared in 
plasma or in blood after disappearance of tipiracil, which indicates that 6-HMU was slowly produced. No other 
metabolites greater than 5% were observed in plasma, urine and faeces. 
Polymorphism 
Trifluridine  is  a  substrate  for  thymidine  phosphorylase  and  thymidine  kinase  and  for  human  nucleoside 
transporters. Polymorphism of these enzymes and transporters has not been investigated. 
Inter-conversion 
Trifluridine and tipiracil are polymorphic; however, given the high solubility of these compounds there is no

difference in the dissolution rate between the polymorphic forms. 
Pharmacokinetic of metabolites 
The main metabolite of trifluridine is FTY, which in detected in plasma and urine in a relevant concentration. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters of FTY are summarized in Table 25. The trifluridine-glucuronide isomers were not 
detected in plasma only in urine.  
Table 25: Single-dose TAS-102 PK studies – Mean ± SD (%CV) 
Concentrations  of  tipiracil  metabolite,  6-HMU,  were  low  in  plasma  and  Cmax  was  reached  48h  after 
administration of TAS-102.  Approximately 17% of the tipiracil dose was excreted 6-HMU in the feces. tipiracil 
Excretion 
Urinary excretion of trifluridine, FTY, tipiracil and trifluridine metabolites was evaluated after single dose 
TAS-102 in relative bioavailability study-TAS-102-104 in the US and in the dose finding study J001-10040010 in 
Japanese patients. 
Of the administered dose, 21% - 25% was excreted as trifluridine related compounds but only a small fraction 
of the administered dose of TAS-102 was excreted as unchanged trifluridine (1.5 and 3.7%). 
Twenty seven (27) % - 29% of the administered dose of tipiracil was excreted in its unchanged form. Renal 
clearance of tipiracil was 293 ml/min, exceeding the glomular filtration rate suggesting a transporter mediated 
excretion of tipiracil in the urine, presumably OCT2. 
In the mass balance study TAS-102-108, an oral solution incorporating a light tracer dose of either 
[14C]-trifluridine or [14C]-tipiracil and 60 mg TAS-102 was administered on Day 1 in 8 patients (4 patients 
received [14C]-trifluridine / 60 mg TAS-102 and 4 patients received [14C]-tipiracil /60 mg TAS-102). Of the 
administered [14C]-trifluridine, on average, 60% of the radioactivity was recovered, consisting of 54.8% urinary 
excretion, 2.6% fecal excretion, and 2.4% expired CO2 (see Table 26).The overall recovery of radioactivity was 
relatively poor  probably due to covalent binding to proteins and incorporation in DNA.

Results of the mass balance study in the subjects administered a tracer dose of or [14C]-tipiracil and 60 mg 
TAS-102 is shown in the below table. Fecal excretion represented 50 ± 22% of total excretion of the 
administered dose, while renal excretion accounted for 27 ± 8%. In 1 patient, the overall recovery was 
extremely poor at 36.3% of the dose (18.8% urine and 17.5% feces), probably due to poor fecal production. For 
the other 3 patients, the overall recoveries were > 85% and similar across the remaining patients.

Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality 
In a dose finding study (15 to 35 mg/m2 twice daily), the AUC from time 0 to 10 hours (AUC0-10) of trifluridine 
tended  to  increase  more  than  expected  based  on  the  increase  in  dose;  however,  oral  clearance  (CL/F)  and 
apparent  volume  of  distribution  (Vd/F)  of  trifluridine  were  generally  constant  at  the  dose  range  of  20  to 
35mg/m2.  As for the other exposure parameters of trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride, those appeared to be 
dose proportional. 
Time dependency 
In the pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses of the multiple dose administration of Lonsurf (35 mg/m2/dose, twice daily 
for 5 days a week with 2 days rest for 2 weeks followed by a 14-day rest, repeated every 4 weeks), trifluridine 
area  under  the  concentration-time  curve  from  time  0  to  the  last  measurable  concentration  (AUC0-last)  was 
approximately 3-fold higher and maximum concentration (Cmax) was approximately 2-fold higher after multiple 
dose administration (Day 12 of Cycle 1) of Lonsurf than after single-dose (Day 1 of Cycle 1) (see section 5.2 of 
the SmPC). 
There was no indication of further accumulation of trifluridine with successive cycles of TAS-102 administration 
(i.e. Day 12 of Cycle 2 and of Cycle 3 compared to that of Cycle 1). 
The AUC for FTY was also increased (1.5-fold) after multiple dosing of TAS-102 compared to Day 1 in studies 
TPU-TAS-102-102, TPU-TAS-102-103 but not in Study J001-10040010; Cmax values for FTY were similar after 
single and multiple dosing. Elimination half-life of FTY was increased following multiple dosing. On Day 1, the 
t1/2  ranged  from  1.5  to  1.8  hours  on  average,  and,  on  Day  12,  the  t1/2  ranged  from  4.1  to  7.3  hours  on 
average. 
For tipiracil, AUC, and Cmax were similar after single and multiple dosing of TAS-102. There was no accumulation 
for tipiracil hydrochloride, and no further accumulation of trifluridine with successive cycles (Day 12 of Cycles 2 
and 3) of administration of Lonsurf.  
Following multiple doses of Lonsurf (35 mg/m2/dose twice daily) in patients with advanced solid tumours, the 
mean times to peak plasma concentrations (tmax) of trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride were around 2 hours 
EMA/CHMP/287846/2016 
Page 44/106 
  
  
  
 
and 3 hours, respectively. 
Endogenous  thymidine  exposure  increased  considerably  by  TAS-102  35  mg/m2;  plasma  concentrations 
increased from 2 ng/ml to 97 ng/ml. 
Intrasubject variability 
Study TPU-TAS-102-104 was a partial replicate design study, allowing for intra-subject variability estimation. 
There is a considerable intersubject variability for both trifluridine and tipiracil. The intra-subject variability, 
however, is low to moderate for trifluridine AUC 16.4% and Cmax 25.4%, respectively, while the intra-subject 
variability of tipiracil is moderate to high 28.9% for AUC and 36% for Cmax. 
Target populations 
Pharmacokinetic parameters CL/F and Vd/F estimated by popPK analysis were in agreement with the 
pharmacokinetic parameters determined by non-compartmental analysis in patients with solid tumours.  
Exposure of trifluridine and tipiracil in patients with CRC has been determined in the phase 3 study RESOURSE 
by means of popPK analysis.  
Special populations 
Population PK analysis was conducted to evaluate intrinsic and extrinsic factors that may influence trifluridine 
and tipiracil exposure. The comparable exposure of trifluridine and tipiracil in patients with different BSA 
supports TAS-102 dosing based on BSA. In addition, creatinine clearance was a significant covariate for CL/F of 
trifluridine and tipiracil, and serum albumin was a significant covariate for CL/F of trifluridine. Other covariates 
tested such as age, gender, race, hepatic function parameters, and concomitant administration of OCT2 inhibitor 
were not significant covariates for either trifluridine or tipiracil PK parameters. 
Impaired renal function 
No formal renal impairment study has been conducted for Lonsurf. Based on a population PK analysis, the 
exposure of Lonsurf in patients with mild renal impairment (CrCl = 60 to 89 mL/min) was similar to those in 
patients with normal renal function (CrCl ≥ 90 mL/min). A higher exposure of Lonsurf was observed in 
moderate renal impairment (CrCl = 30 to 59 mL/min). Estimated (CrCl) was a significant covariate for CL/F in 
both final models of trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride. The mean relative ratio of AUC in patients with mild 
(n=38) and moderate (n=16) renal impairment compared to patients with normal renal function (n=84) were 
1.31 and 1.43 for trifluridine, respectively, and 1.34 and 1.65 for tipiracil hydrochloride, respectively.  The PK of 
trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride have not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment or 
end-stage renal disease (see section 5.2 of the SmPC).  
Impaired hepatic function 
No formal hepatic impairment study has been conducted for Lonsurf. Based on the population PK analysis, liver 
function parameters including alkaline phosphatase (ALP, 36-2322 U/L), aspartate aminotransferase (AST, 
11-197 U/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT, 5-182 U/L) , and total bilirubin (0.17-3.20 mg/dL) were not 
significant covariates for PK parameters of either trifluridine or tipiracil hydrochloride. The PK of trifluridine and 
tipiracil hydrochloride have not been studied in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (NCI 
Criteria Group C and D). Serum albumin was found to significantly affect trifluridine clearance, with a negative 
correlation. For low albumin values ranging from 2.2 to 3.5 g/dL, the corresponding clearance values range from 
4.2 to 3.1 L/h (see sections 4.4 and 5.2 of the SmPC).

The comparable exposure of trifluridine and tipiracil in patients with different BSA supports TAS-102 dosing 
based on BSA. 
In relation with age, number of patients ≥65 years of age included in population PK analysis should be broken 
down by the following ranges of age: 65-74, 75-84 and >85. 
Age 
The age of the patients ranged from 33 to 82 years old in the dataset analysed. Age was not a significant 
covariate for PK parameters of either trifluridine or tipiracil. Therefore, the PK of trifluridine and tipiracil are not 
expected to be affected by age. 
Table 28: Number of elderly patients in TAS-102 PK studies 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No dedicated in vivo drug interaction studies were conducted. 
In vitro studies with human biomaterials showed no evidence that trifluridine and tipiracil are metabolized by the 
CYP enzymes tested. Neither trifluridine, FTY, nor tipiracil had an inhibitory or inducing effect on CYP suggesting 
that neither trifluridine, FTY, nor tipiracil would cause, or be affected by, a CYP-mediated drug interaction. The 
concentration of tipiracil in the induction study was too low to investigate the potential induction in intestinal 
cells. Potential induction of intestinal, renal and hepatic CYP3A4 by tipiracil relevant concentrations should be 
investigated.  
Trifluridine seems to be no substrate for OATP1B1, OATP1B3, P-glycoprotein, BCRP. In vitro studies indicated 
that trifluridine is a substrate for the nucleoside transporters CNT1, ENT1 and ENT2. Tipiracil was a substrate for 
OCT2 and MATE1 but not for OAT1, OAT3, P-glycoprotein, and BCRP.  
Although tipiracil is also an in vitro inhibitor of OCT2, it is not considered to be an in vivo inhibitor, due to the 
relative high inhibition constant compared to the in vivo exposure to tipiracil.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Trifluridine is an antineoplastic thymidine-based nucleoside analogue, which is incorporated into 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in tumour cells following phosphorylation by thymidine kinase 1. TAS-102 
demonstrated antitumour activity against both 5-FU sensitive and resistant colorectal cancer cell lines. The 
cytotoxic activity of TAS-102 against several human tumour xenografts correlated with the amount of trifluridine 
incorporated into DNA, confirming this as the primary mechanism of action. These data provide support for 
rationale of treatment of patients with metastatic CRC with TAS-102 after initial treatment with conventional 
fluoropyrimidines. 
Tipiracil inhibits degradation of trifluridine by inhibiting thymidine phosphorylase (thymidine phosphorylase), 
thus increasing systemic exposure to trifluridine when trifluridine and tipiracil are given together. 
Co-administration of tipiracil resulted in a 37-fold increase in trifluridine exposure 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Biomarkers  
In RECOURSE, patients were stratified for KRAS status. BRAF status was reported when status was available. No 
biomarker analysis was planned for RECOURSE. 
Exposure-effect relationship  
Specific dose-response and blood level-response analyses of efficacy with TAS-102 have not been completed. A 
PK/PD analysis of data obtained in the pivotal Phase 3 study (TPU-TAS-102-301; RECOURSE) was submitted 
with the response to D120 LoQ. 
This report evaluated the PKPD data collected during the RECOURSE trial. A total of 138/534 (25.8%) patients 
in the TAS-102 group had evaluable parameters (estimated trifluridine AUC and tipiracil AUC) and are included 
in the PK/PD analysis. Patients in the TAS-102 treatment group who participated in the optional PK assessment 
were  categorised  into  two  groups,  a  high-exposure  group  (>median)  and  a  low-exposure  group  (≤median) 
based on median AUC values of trifluridine (43.51 hr*µg/mL) and tipiracil (0.65 hr*µg/mL).  
Patient demographics and baseline characteristics for most parameters were comparable for the 2 groups and 
within the patient subgroups defined according to median trifluridine or tipiracil  AUCs. In the trifluridine and 
tipiracil high AUC groups, there were more patients ≥65 years of age (trifluridine, 50.7%; tipiracil, 46.4%) and 
more patients with mild to moderate renal impairment at baseline based on creatinine clearance (trifluridine, 
56.5%; tipiracil, 56.5%) and baseline eGFR (trifluridine, 49.3%; tipiracil, 50.7%) compared to the respective 
low AUC group with baseline based on creatinine clearance (trifluridine, 21.7%; tipiracil, 21.7%) and baseline 
eGFR  (trifluridine,  21.7%;  tipiracil,  20.3%).  In  the  trifluridine  high  AUC  subgroup  there  were  more  females 
47.8% vs the low AUC subgroup 26.1%, while there was no difference for the tipiracil high/low subgroups 36.2% 
vs. 37.7%. 
The subpopulation included in the PKPD analysis is not fully representative for the TAS-102 treated subgroup as 
overall survival seems higher in in this PKPD population vs. TAS-102 ITT population in RECOURSE (8.9 vs 7.1 
months and HR 0.53 vs. 0.68). This trend was observed also for radiologic PFS as the TAS-102 PK/PD group 
median PFS (3.3 months) was longer for TAS-102 and placebo (2.0 and 1.7 months, respectively). Therefore, 
the data should be interpreted with caution. 
In the trifluridine group, OS appeared more favourable in the high AUC group compared to the low AUC group 
EMA/CHMP/287846/2016 
Page 47/106 
  
  
  
(HR, 0.72 [CI: 0.46, 1.11]) and the associated OS medians were 9.3 vs. 8.1 months, respectively. PFS also 
appeared more favourable in the high AUC group compared to the low AUC group (HR, 0.82 [CI: 0.57, 1.18]) 
and the associated PFS medians were 3.7 vs. 2.0 months, respectively. 
In the tipiracil group, the direction of the OS effect was not as pronounced, but was in favour of the low tipiracil 
AUC group (HR, 1.09 [CI: 0.70, 1.69]) and median OS was 7.8 months in the high AUC group compared with 9.2 
months in the low AUC group. No specific pattern emerged in the PFS results with a HR 0.97, [CI: 0.67, 1.41] 
and median PFS of 2.0 months in the high AUC group compared to 3.7 months in the low AUC group. 
Consistent with the OS and PFS results for the overall PK/PD Population, all AUC groups performed better than 
placebo throughout the follow-up period. 
QTc prolongation  
Pre-clinical  studies  indicate  that  trifluridine  and  tipiracil  have  no  effect  on  hERG  channel.  Also  other 
fluoropyrimidines are not known to prolongate QTc prolongation.  
Based  on  the  results  of  the  linear  model  for  the  relationship  between  plasma  trifluridine,  FTY,  and  tipiracil 
concentrations  and  the  placebo-adjusted  baseline-subtracted  QTc  intervals,  no  concentration  dependent 
QT-prolonging effect was observed.   
Haematologic toxicities  
In  the  dose  finding  study  J001-10040010,  Cmax  and  AUC  of  trifluridine  were  associated  with  haematologic 
toxicities. In RECOURSE study, PKPD analysis indicated that the incidence of Grade ≥3 neutropenia and any 
Grade ≥3 drug related AE was higher (>10%) in the trifluridine high AUC group compared with the low AUC 
group. Any dose reduction was higher in the trifluridine high AUC group (23%) compared with the low AUC group 
(9%). However, no apparent difference was seen between the tipiracil high AUC group and the low AUC group. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions  
Trifluridine, like other thymidine analogues such as the anti-viral agent AZT, is phosphorylated by thymidine 
kinase  prior  to  incorporation  into  DNA.  Attenuation  of  the  inhibitory  effect  of  trifluridine  on  tumour  cell 
proliferation in the presence of AZT was considered due to competition for thymidine kinase in vitro (Study No. 
03-13-004). However, treatment with TAS-102 in combination with AZT in rats did not influence the toxicity 
relative to TAS-102 alone (Study No.13CC20). 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Trifluridine is an antineoplastic thymidine-based nucleoside analogue, which is incorporated into 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in tumour cells following phosphorylation by thymidine kinase 1. TAS-102 
demonstrated antitumour activity against both 5-FU sensitive and resistant colorectal cancer cell lines. The 
cytotoxic activity of TAS-102 against several human tumour xenografts correlated with the amount of trifluridine 
incorporated into DNA, confirming this as the primary mechanism of action. These data provided support for 
rationale of treatment of patients with metastatic CRC with TAS-102 after initial treatment with conventional 
fluoropyrimidines.  
In the pivotal study RECOURSE, patients were stratified for KRAS status. No further biomarker analysis was 
planned for RECOURSE. Relation of expression of thymidine phosphorylase and thymidine kinase, two enzymes 
known to play an essential role in the mechanism of action of trifluridine, with efficacy has not been discussed. 
In cell lines development of resistance to trifluridine involved decreased activity of thymidine kinase 1 and 
EMA/CHMP/287846/2016 
Page 48/106 
  
  
  
nucleoside transporter (Temmink 2010). In xenografts, antitumor activity of TAS-102 was best related to the 
thymidine kinase and thymidine phosphorylase ratio (Emura 2004). Furthermore, deficient mismatch repair 
enzyme status (dMMR) is associated with sensitivity to fluoropyrimidine-based adjuvant treatment of CRC 
(Sargent 2010) and, given the mechanism of action of trifluridine, MMR status could be an important marker for 
TAS-102 treatment. MSI status and TK1 as possible biomarkers will be further explored in a selected Japanese 
subpopulation from the phase III RECOURSE study.  
The oral bioavailability of trifluridine is low due to degradation by thymidine phosphorylase, therefore 
monotherapy with trifluridine is not feasible. Tipiracil prevents degradation of trifluridine by inhibiting thymidine 
phosphorylase (thymidine phosphorylase), thus increasing systemic exposure to trifluridine when trifluridine 
and tipiracil are given together. Co-administration of tipiracil resulted in a 37-fold increase in trifluridine 
exposure. This demonstrates the rationale for addition of tipiracil, in the combination of trifluridine and tipiracil 
(TAS-102).  
Trifluridine and tipiracil have high solubility and low/moderate permeability characteristics. Permeability of 
trifluridine and tipiracil is the rate limiting step for absorption. 
The to-be marketed formulation has not been used in clinical studies. The composition of the to-be marketed 
formulation is identical to the late formulation except for imprinting. No bioequivalence study is considered 
necessary for the to-be market formulation, because trifluridine and tipiracil are BCS class III compounds, the 
composition of the tablets was identical and dissolution of all formulations was very fast at all pH tested, i.e. 
dissolution ≥85% at 15min.  
Selection of the tipiracil dose in TAS-102 was based on a single dose finding study in 4 male cynomolgous 
monkeys 4 using one trifluridine dose with 3 different tipiracil doses (molar ratio trifluridine:tipiracil 1:0.2, 1:0.5 
and 1:1). All three doses of tipiracil greatly enhanced the oral bioavailability of trifluridine in monkeys. The 
applicant did not provide in vitro data on the inhibition of thymidine phosphorylase by tipiracil to support dosing 
based on molar ratio rather than using a high flat tipiracil dose that maximally inhibits thymidine phosphorylase. 
No studies in humans were conducted to confirm the appropriate dose of tipiracil. Although study TAS-102-102 
showed that bioavailability of trifluridine was greatly increased in presence of tipiracil a more than dose 
proportional increase in trifluridine was observed over the dose range 15-35 mg/m2 suggesting that inhibition of 
thymidine phosphorylase by tipiracil is not maximal. tipiracil is an competitive inhibitor of TPase with a Ki of 5 
ng/ml. Because tipiracil was shown to be a competitive inhibitor of TPase, the dose administration of tipiracil as 
a molar ratio to trifluridine is considered acceptable. However, it was shown that there is a positive correlation 
between trifluridine and tipiracil exposure. The estimated 1.5-2 fold higher trifluridine exposure as results of a 
higher tipiracil exposure is small compared to the 37-fold increase in exposure of trifluridine as result of 
co-administration with tipiracil. Therefore, inhibition of TPase by tipiracil is probably near maximal. 
The clinical dose and dosing interval of Lonsurf has been supported by non-clinical studies but final dose and 
dosing interval i.e. 35 mg/m2 bid for 5 days a week with 2 days rest for 2 weeks, followed by a 14-day rest, 
repeated every 4 weeks, has been selected based on tolerability in patients with solid tumours and CRC. Given 
the high number of dose delay in the phase 3 study and the two different MTD determined, the applicant was 
requested to discuss the selected dose and dosing interval further (see clinical efficacy part). Exposure effect 
relationship indicated that higher exposure to trifluridine was associated with longer overall survival and greater 
risk of safety events, but exposure to tipiracil was not. 
The applicant claims that 80 mg/dose should not be exceeded as included in the protocol for RECOURSE study. 
However ASCO guideline (2012) recommends the use of actual body weight to calculate appropriate dose of 
chemotherapy drugs for obese patients. Additional PopPK analysis indicated that capping of the dose to 80 mg 
in the current dosing regimen is unlikely to result in underexposure of FTD in obese adult patients.

The applicant recommended TAS-102 to be administered in a fed state because C max and AUC of trifluridine were 
associated with haematologic toxicities (Study J001-100400100) and Cmax of trifluridine was lower under fed 
conditions. When taken within one hour after completing a meal, trifluridine and tipiracil are rapidly absorbed 
with Tmax of around 2 hours and 3 hours, respectively. After peak concentrations are reached, trifluridine and 
tipiracil plasma concentrations declined rapidly with an elimination half-life of 2 hours. In the clinical dose range 
20-35 mg/m2, trifluridine pharmacokinetics can be considered dose proportional.  The AUC of trifluridine was 
not decreased after a meal and, therefore, the applicant considered it unlikely that efficacy is affected when 
TAS-102 is administered with a meal. The dosing recommendation in the SmPC to take TAS-102 after a meal 
reflect the conditions it has been administered in the pivotal and most other clinical studies. 
Exposure of trifluridine was 2 to 3-fold higher following multiple dosing (Day 12 cycle 1) compared to single dose 
administration of TAS-102. This is unexpected given the short elimination half-life of trifluridine 2 h and the 
twice daily dosing. There was no indication of further accumulation of trifluridine with successive cycles of 
TAS-102 administration (i.e. Day 12 of Cycle 2 and of Cycle 3 compared to that of Cycle 1). Pharmacokinetics of 
tipiracil were dose proportional and  exposure was similar after single and multiple dosing of TAS-102. Therefore 
a more profound inhibition of thymidine phosphorylase by tipiracil following multiple dosing is not expected. 
Reasons for the time dependent pharmacokinetics of trifluridine is not known. Because maximal accumulation 
was reached by the end of the first cycle and did not further increase in following cycles and the accumulation 
was consistent among patients, the accumulation of trifluridine after repeated administration is considered not 
to be a safety or efficacy risk of TAS-102.  
Major elimination pathway for trifluridine seems degradation by thymidine phosphorylase to metabolite FTY. FTY 
does not show anti-tumour activity.  Of the administered dose, 55% of the administered dose was excreted as 
trifluridine related compounds but only a small fraction of the administered dose of TAS-102 was excreted as 
unchanged trifluridine (1.5 and 3.7%). Nevertheless, trifluridine exposure was approximately 50% higher in 
patients with moderate renal impairment compared to patients with normal renal function. Trifluridine exposure 
was correlated with tipiracil exposure. Therefore, the increased trifluridine exposure in patients with moderate 
renal impairment might (in part) be due to the higher tipiracil exposure in patients with moderate renal 
impairment.  
Excretion of tipiracil in the urine is probably the primary elimination pathway of tipiracil but 17% of the 
administered dose was excreted as 6-HMU metabolite in faeces, indicating a secondary elimination pathway. 
27% - 29% of the administered dose of tipiracil was excreted in its unchanged form. Renal clearance of tipiracil 
was 293 ml/min, exceeding the glomerular filtration rate suggesting a transporter mediated excretion of tipiracil 
in the urine. Tipiracil is a substrate for OCT2 and MATE1. These transporters may be involved in the excretion of 
tipiracil in urine.  
In the popPK analysis, no patients with severe renal impairment and moderate or severe hepatic impairment 
were included. Lack of efficacy and safety data in patients with severe renal impairment and moderate and 
severe hepatic impairment has been acknowledged in the SmPC. Trifluridine exposure was approximately 50% 
higher in patients with moderate renal impairment compared to patients with normal renal function. Patients 
with moderate renal impairment experienced more adverse events and should be more often monitored for 
haematological toxicities (see section 4.4 of the SmPC). The applicant will conduct a renal impairment study 
(TPU-TAS-102-107), which results will be available by December 2017. In addition, a formal hepatic impairment 
study is considered necessary. The applicant will conduct a hepatic impairment study (TPU-TAS-102-106) and 
submit the results by December 2017 (see RMP).

There was a negative correlation between serum albumin and CL/F of trifluridine. In vitro studies indicated that 
protein binding was not concentration dependent. Ex vivo protein binding in plasma from subjects in the renal 
and hepatic impairment studies may further elucidate this issue. 
No adjustment of the starting dose is required on the basis of patient’s race. 
The influence of gastrectomy on PK parameters could not be examined in the population PK analysis because 
there were few patients who had undergone gastrectomy (1% of overall). This is adequately reflected in section 
5.2 of the SmPC. 
Potential interactions involving CYP450 enzymes is considered low as trifluridine and tipiracil are no substrate, 
inhibitor or inducer of CYP450 enzymes. However, inductive effect of tipiracil on human CYP isoforms cannot be 
excluded.  
In vitro transport studies indicated that trifluridine and tipiracil are no substrates for P-glycoprotein and BCRP 
and trifluridine is not likely to be a substrate for OATP1B1. OATP1B3, OAT1, and OAT3 transporters. 
Trifluridine is intracellularly activated by thymidine kinase. Nucleoside transporters mediate the uptake of 
trifluridine into the cells (Takahashi 2015, Sakamoto 2015) In vitro studies have indicated that expression of 
thymidine kinase and expression of nucleoside transporters may be involved in resistance to trifluridine. Effect 
of polymorphisms on trifluridine function is not known but for gemcitabine, expression of hENT1 and 
polymorphism of hENT1 has been associated with efficacy and toxicity of gemcitabine (Tanaka et al 2010).  
Trifluridine, like other thymidine analogues such as the anti-viral agent AZT, is phosphorylated by thymidine 
kinase prior to incorporation into DNA. Caution is required when using medicinal products that are human 
thymidine kinase substrates, e.g., zidovudine.  Such medicinal products, if used concomitantly with Lonsurf, 
may compete with the effector, trifluridine, for activation via thymidine kinases.  Therefore, when using antiviral 
medicinal products that are human thymidine kinase substrates, monitor for possible decreased efficacy of the 
antiviral medicinal product, and consider switching to an alternative antiviral medicinal product that is not a 
human thymidine kinase substrate, such as lamivudine, zalcitabine, didanosine and abacavir (see sections 4.5 
and 5.1 of the SmPC). 
Study J001-100400100 showed that endogenous thymidine exposure increased considerably by Lonsurf 35 
mg/m2 from 2 to 97 ng/ml. However, the increased concentration of thymidine following multiple dosing of 
Lonsurf is still much lower than the plasma concentrations of trifluridine Cmax 2381 ng/mL, therefore, 
competition for phosphorylation by thymidine kinase 1 or nucleoside transporters seems unlikely. 
As trifluridine was shown to be a substrate for the nucleoside transporters CNT1, ENT1 and ENT2, caution is 
required when using medicinal products that interact with these transporters. 
No dedicated in vivo drug interaction studies were conducted. Tipiracil hydrochloride was a substrate for OCT2 
and MATE1, therefore, the concentration might be increased when Lonsurf is administered concomitantly with 
inhibitors of OCT2 or MATE1. 
It is unknown whether Lonsurf may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. Therefore, women 
using hormonal contraceptive must also use a barrier contraceptive method (see section 4.6 of the SmPC). 
The efficacy and safety of Lonsurf was compared between a high-exposure group (>median) and a 
low-exposure group (≤median) based on the median AUC value of trifluridine. OS appeared more favourable in 
the high AUC group compared to the low AUC group (median OS of 9.3 vs. 8.1 months, respectively). All AUC 
groups performed better than placebo throughout the follow-up period. The incidences of Grade ≥3 neutropenia 
were higher in the high-trifluridine AUC group (47.8%) compared with the low-trifluridine AUC group (30.4%).

2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacology package supporting the pharmacokinetic & pharmacodynamic characterisation of trifluridine 
and tipiracil is comprehensive and in general well executed. Studies in patients with renal and hepatic impaired 
function are ongoing and results are awaited (see RMP). Induction of CYP enzymes by tipiracil cannot yet be 
excluded and the applicant is recommended to conduct an additional in vitro CYP induction study using the 
appropriate concentration of tipiracil. In addition, the applicant is recommended to further evaluate biomarkers 
involved in the mechanism of action of trifluridine.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
This application is supported by the results of one pivotal phase III TPU-TAS-102-301 RECOURSE study and 
supportive data from a Phase II trial conducted in Japan (Study J003-10040030). 
2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
A series of initial dose-finding Phase 1 studies were conducted in the US in patients with solid tumours. Based on 
preclinical findings (Study M96-029), these studies used daily dosing of TAS-102 in order to facilitate FTD 
incorporation into tumour cells. In the first 3 studies initiated (Studies TAS102-9801, TAS102-9802, and 
TAS102-9803), TAS-102 was administered once daily (QD) using various dosing schedules of 3- or 4-week 
cycles. The initial starting dose in the first human study (TAS102-9801) was 100 mg/m2/day, which was 1/3 of 
the toxic low dose in a 4-week toxicity study in monkeys. The results of these studies indicated that TAS-102 
was better tolerated when administered for 5 consecutive days rather than for 14 consecutive days, and a dose 
regimen of 5 days a week with 2 days rest for 2 weeks, repeated every 4 weeks was determined to be the 
optimal dosing regimen. 
While these initial 3 studies were on-going, results of non-clinical studies became available that demonstrated 
significantly greater tumour reduction in mice following BID dosing compared with QD dosing. Therefore, 2 
additional studies were initiated to evaluate BID and three times daily (TID) dosing (Studies TAS102-9804 and 
TAS102-9805, respectively) using the regimen of 5 days a week with 2 days rest for 2 weeks, repeated every 4 
weeks. In Study TAS102-9804, which was conducted in heavily pre-treated breast cancer patients, the 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was 50 mg/m2/day, while in study TAS102-9805, which was conducted in a 
patient population of primarily mCRC patients, the MTD was 70 mg/m2/day. 
In a subsequent Phase 1 dose-finding study conducted in Japan (Study J001-10040010), a TAS-102 regimen of 
35 mg/m2 BID (70 mg/m2/day) administered for 5 days a week with 2 days rest for 2 weeks, followed by a 
14-day rest (1 treatment cycle) repeated every 4 weeks, was well tolerated in patients with advanced solid 
tumours. The efficacy and safety of this regimen was established in the Japanese Phase 2 study in patients with 
mCRC (Study J003-10040030). The tolerability of this regimen in Western patients with refractory metastatic 
colorectal cancer was confirmed in a Phase 1 dose-finding study conducted in the US (Study TPU-TAS-102-101). 
Therefore, this regimen was selected for evaluation in the pivotal, global, Phase 3 study (RECOURSE). 
Selection of the tipiracil dose in TAS-102 was based on a single dose finding study in 4 male cynomolgous 
monkeys 4 using one trifluridine dose with 3 different tipiracil doses (molar ratio trifluridine:tipiracil 1:0.2, 1:0.5 
and 1:1). All three doses of tipiracil greatly enhanced the oral bioavailability of trifluridine in monkeys. Because 
the difference in AUC of trifluridine was not statistically significant different for 1:0.5 and 1:1 ratio, TAS-102 was 
optimized at a molar ratio of 1:0.5 (trifluridine:tipiracil).

Treatments 
Patients  received  TAS-102  35  mg/m2/dose  or  placebo,  administered  orally  BID  (after  morning  and  evening 
meals) for 5 days a week and 2 days of rest (during weeks 1 and 2), followed by a 14-day rest (1 treatment 
cycle), repeated every 4 weeks. 
Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment 
Once patient confirmation of eligibility and the criteria for randomisation had been met, patients were centrally 
randomised in a 2:1 ratio to TAS-102 or placebo via an Interactive Voice/Web Response System (IWRS) based 
on a dynamic allocation method (biased coin). The IWRS assigned kit numbers corresponding to the patient’s 
treatment assignment and informed the study site user of the kit number that had been assigned to the patient 
for the dispensing of study drug. 
Duration  
EMA/CHMP/287846/2016 
Page 54/106 
  
  
  
Patients received study medication until any of the discontinuation criteria were met:  
•  Patient request at any time irrespective of the reason; 
•  RECIST-defined or clinical disease progression; 
•  Patient experienced an irreversible, treatment-related, Grade 4, clinically relevant, non-haematologic 
event; 
•  Unacceptable toxicity, or change in underlying condition such that the patient could no longer tolerate 
therapy; 
•  Physician’s decision (includen the need for other anticancer treatments); 
•  Pregnancy. 
Dose reductions/Interruptions 
Study medication dose reductions were allowed in the case of toxicity. A maximum of 3 dose reductions of study 
medication  were  permitted,  in  5  mg/m2  steps,  to  a  minimum  dose  of  20  mg/m2  (40  mg/m2/day).  Dose 
escalations (on a “mg/m2” basis) were not permitted at any time. 
Objectives 
The  primary  objective  of  the  RECOURSE  trial  was  to  compare  the  overall  survival  (OS)  for  TAS-102  +  best 
supportive  care  (BSC)  (experimental  arm)  with  placebo  +  BSC  (control  arm)  in  patients  with  refractory 
metastatic colorectal cancer.  
Secondary  objectives  included  the  comparison  of  TAS-102  and  placebo  for  Progression-free  survival  (PFS); 
Safety and tolerability. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint: 
Overall survival was defined as the time [in months] from the date of randomisation to the date of death for each 
patient in the ITT population. 
Secondary endpoint: 
-  PFS  was  defined  as  the  time  (in  months)  from  the  date  of  randomisation  until  the  date  of  the 
investigator-assessed radiological disease progression or death due to any cause. 
- Time to treatment failure was defined as the time (in months) from the date of randomisation until the date of 
radiologic disease progression, permanent discontinuation of study treatment, or death due to any cause. 
- Overall response rate was defined as the proportion of patients with objective evidence of complete response 
(CR)  or  partial  response  (PR)  with  no  confirmatory  scan  required.  The  assessment  of  ORR  was  based  on 
Investigator  review  of  radiologic  images  following  RECIST  criteria  (version  1.1,  2009)  and  was  restricted  to 
patients with measurable disease (at least 1 target lesion) at baseline and with at least one tumour evaluation 
while on study treatment. 
- Disease control rate was defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall response of CR, PR, or SD. 
- Duration of response, derived for patients with a best overall response of PR or CR, was defined as the time 
from the first documentation of response (CR or PR) to the first documentation of objective tumour progression 
or to death due to any cause.

Sample size 
The study was designed to detect with 90% power a hazard ratio for OS of 0.75 (25% risk reduction) in the 
TAS-102 arm compared with the placebo arm with a 1-sided type 1 error of 0.025. A variable accrual period of 
18 months and a 3% per year loss to survival follow-up rate was assumed. Using a treatment allocation of 2:1 
(TAS-102: placebo) of 800 patients, a target of 571 events (deaths) was required for the primary analysis. 
Based  on  these  design  operating  characteristics  and  assuming  a  median  survival  time  of  approximately  5 
months  in  the  control  arm,  the  primary  analysis  target  events  milestone  was  projected  to  be  reached 
approximately 5 months after the last patient was randomised in the study. The median OS in the control arm 
was estimated based on the observed median of 4.6 months in a similar control arm of the Phase 3 cetuximab 
study. The estimate was rounded to 5 months to reflect a higher control median in the Japanese population, as 
observed in the Phase 2 study (J003-10040030). 
Randomisation 
Patients  were  randomised  (2:1)  to  receive  TAS-102  or  placebo.  In  order  to  ensure  comparability  of  the 
treatment groups, patients were to be stratified by KRAS status (wild-type, mutant), time since diagnosis of 
metastasis (<18 months,  ≥18 months),  and geographic region (Region 1: Asia [Japan]; Region 2: Western 
[Australia, Europe, US]). 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind study. TAS-102 tablets of each of the strengths and the corresponding placebo tablets 
were identical in appearance and were packaged in identical containers. During the conduct of the study, the 
treatment assignment was unknown to all patients, investigators, and ancillary study personnel at each study 
site.  
Statistical methods 
Analysis sets 
The primary population for the efficacy analysis was the ITT population, which was defined as all randomized 
patients, independently on whether they received or not study medication.  
The population for safety analysis comprised all patients who received at least 1 dose of study medication. 
Analysis methods 
The difference in OS between the two treatment arms was assessed in the ITT population using the stratified 
log-rank test and the HR was estimated using a Cox proportional hazards (CPH) model including treatment and 
the 3 stratification factors in the model.  Overall survival for each arm was summarised using Kaplan Meier 
curves and was further characterised in terms of the median and survival probability at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months, 
along with the corresponding 2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the estimates.  
The primary analysis of OS includes follow-up data (including death events) obtained through the date of the 
571st death observed in the study. Patients having a documented survival status (alive or dead) after this date 
were censored at the cut-off date. 
For  analyses  of  PFS,  the  two  treatment  groups  were  compared  using  a  log-rank  test  stratified  by  the  same 
stratification factors as used in the analyses of the primary endpoint. The HR (TAS-102 plus BSC group/placebo 
plus BSC group) and 95% confidence interval were provided. KM estimates and KM curves were also presented 
for each treatment group. ORR and DCR were compared between treatments. The differences in ORR between 
EMA/CHMP/287846/2016 
Page 56/106 
  
  
  
the TAS-102 and placebo group and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals were also calculated. Several 
sensitivity analyses for PFS have been performed. 
Interim analyses  
No interim analyses for efficacy or futility were planned or performed during this study.

The original study protocol dated 23 February 2010 was subsequently amended 8 times, including 3 worldwide 
amendments and 5 country-specific amendments. 
Amendment  1  (dated  28  March  2012)  essentially  clarified  inclusion/exclusion  criteria,  and  clarification  of 
stratification variables 
Amendment 2 (dated 22 April 2012) essentially was implemented to remove carbon dioxide measurements from 
clinical chemistry tests 
Amendment  3    (dated  13  November  2012)  essentially  was  implemented  for  clarification  of  end  of  study 
treatment, exclusion criteria and to exclude interacting thymidine analogous during study treatment.

Baseline data 
Table 29: Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics (ITT Population) – RECOURSE study 
More  patients  with  KRAS  wild  type  (85.5%)  were  ≥18  months  post  time  since  diagnosis  of  metastases  
compared to patients with KRAS mutant tumours (73.2%) , consistent with the availability of EGFR-inhibitors for 
patients with KRAS wild-type tumours. ifteen percent of tumours harboured a BRAF wild type and in only 0.7% 
(TAS-102) and 1,5% (placebo)  tumours had a BRAF mutation.

Table 31: Prior Cancer Therapies (ITT Population) – RECOURSE study 
The  median  number  of  prior  lines  of  therapy  for  metastatic  disease  was  3.  All  patients  had  received  prior 
treatment with fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-based chemotherapy; and all but 1 patient had 
received  bevacizumab.  All  but  2  patients  with  KRAS  wild-type  tumours  had  received  panitumumab  or 
cetuximab. The majority of patients (60.9%) had received ≥4 prior systemic cancer therapies. Sixty one percent 
(61%, N = 485) of all randomised patients received a fluoropyrimidine as part of their last treatment regimen 
prior to randomisation, of which 455 (94%) were refractory to the fluoropyrimidine at that time.

Post-study treatments 
Post-treatment included use of regorafenib (Table 32) and was equally distributed between the TAS-102 and 
placebo groups. More than 40% of patients actually received post-study treatments.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint:  
Overall survival 
A total of 574 deaths were included in the primary analysis of OS based on a cut-off date of 24 January 2014. For 
patients alive on the survival cut-off date, survival was censored on the cut-off date. Among patients with 
censored survival data, the median follow-up for OS was 8.29 months (range: 1.8 to 19.0 months).

The overall survival benefit was maintained after adjusting for all significant prognostic factors, namely, time 
since diagnosis of first metastasis, ECOG PS and number of metastatic sites (hazard ratio: 0.69; 95% CI [0.58 
to 0.81]).

Time to treatment failure (TTF) 
Median TTF was 1.9 months for the TAS-102 group versus 1.7 months for the placebo group with a HR of 0.50 
(95% CI: 0.42, 0.58), p<0.0001), consistent with PFS results, considering the small number of patients who 
discontinued treatment for reasons other than disease progression or death.

Clinical studies in special populations 
TAS-102 has not been studied in children (< 18 years) or in pregnant or lactating women. TAS 102 has been 
given to patients ≥75 years of age, but experience is limited. 
Table 39: Summary table of older subjects included in the clinical development of TAS-102 
The effect of TAS-102 on overall survival was similar in patients <65 years and ≥65 years of age. There were no 
patients 85 years or older in the RECOURSE study and the Japanese phase 2 study.  
Table 40: Overall survival by age subgroup (ITT population) – Recourse study 
Moreover the majority of patients enrolled in the studies performed with TAS 102 to date were Caucasian/Whites 
and Asians (57.3% and 34.5% respectively), with data essentially lacking in patients with other races (e.g., 
blacks, etc.).Despite the low number of patients OS and PFS HRs in African Americans are in line with HRs in the 
overall study population and PK data support the potential benefit in this particular population. 
For patients with moderate renal impairment, efficacy seems to be less compared to patients with normal to mild 
renal impairment. However, the small sample size for patients with moderate renal impairment might affect this 
result.  
Table 41: Overall Survival by Renal Function Subgroup (ITT Population) – Recourse study 
In RECOURSE, there were 303 patients with mild hepatic impairment (203 patients treated with TAS-102 and 
100 patients on placebo) and an additional 5 patients who had moderate impairment (1 patient treated with 
TAS-102 and 4 patients on placebo). In patients with mild hepatic impairment, benefit was also demonstrated.

Supportive study 
Study J003-10040030 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study evaluating the 
efficacy and safety of TAS-102 versus placebo in Japanese patients with mCRC who had received prior two or 
more  chemotherapeutic  regimens  including  fluoropyrimidine,  irinotecan,  and  oxaliplatin.  One  hundred  and 
seventy-two (172) Japanese patients were randomised (2:1) to receive TAS-102 (35 mg/m2/dose BID) given 
orally twice daily for 5 days a week with 2 days rest for 2 weeks, repeated every 4 weeks; or placebo.  Patients 
were  stratified by  baseline  ECOG  performance  status  (PS=0,  PS=1  or  2).  The  primary  endpoint  was  overall 
survival. Of the 172 patients randomised, 2 patients discontinued prior to treatment and 1 treated patient was 
not eligible; All patients had received prior treatment with fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-based 
chemotherapy;  82%  of  patients  had  received  ≥3  prior  chemotherapy  regimens.  Demographic  and  other 
baseline characteristics The patients were generally comparable. 
Median  OS  (9.0  months)  was  higher  in  the  TAS-102  group  compared  to  the  placebo  group  (6.6  months  ; 
HR=0.56; 95% CI: [0.39, 0.81]; p = 0.0011). Median PFS assessed by independent review committee was 2.0 
months in the TAS-102 group compared with 1.0 month in the placebo group (HR=0.41; 95% CI: [0.28, 0.59]; 
p < 0.0001).Overall response rate was 0.9% (1/112) in the TAS-102 group and 0.0% (0/57) in the placebo 
group. Disease control rate was 43.8% (49/112) in the TAS-102 group and 10.5% (6/57) in the placebo group 
(p<0.0001). The expression of TK1 and TPase proteins were not related to efficacy endpoints (DCR, PFS and OS) 
in either group. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The clinical dose and dosing interval of TAS-102 has been supported by non-clinical studies but final dose and 
dosing interval i.e. 35 mg/m2 bid for 5 days a week with 2 days rest for 2 weeks, followed by a 14-day rest, 
repeated every 4 weeks, has been selected based on tolerability in patients with solid tumours and CRC.  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The  evidence  of  efficacy  of  TAS-102  in  patients  with  mCRC  is  based  on  the  results  of  one  pivotal  study 
(RECOURSE), supported by the data of phase III study J003-1004030, enrolling Japanese patients with mCRC.  
RECOURSE  is  a  pivotal,  phase  III,  multicentre,  multinational,  randomized,  double  blind,  placebo-controlled 
study. The two arms design of the study with placebo plus BSC as comparator is considered acceptable, as 
patients enrolled in the trial had received all the standard treatment options currently available in EU except for 
the multikinase inhibitor regorafenib, which has not been granted MA at the time of the beginning of the study. 
However, with the enrolment of patients, 18% of patients in the RECOURSE study actually received regorafenib 
as prior therapy.  
Half of patients in both groups had KRAS mutant and these were balanced between the two groups. 
Although in the minority of patients, BRAF data were available and collected (15.5%). BRAF mutations were 
EMA/CHMP/287846/2016 
Page 73/106 
  
  
  
 
found in 8 of the 124 subjects (6.5%), which is in line with the reported range in the literature. It is not likely that 
missing data on BRAF status would have led to a serious mismatch of assignment for this prognostic factor. 
The selection of OS as primary endpoint of the pivotal RECOURSE study corresponds to the accepted standards 
of  clinical  cancer  research  and  is  in  accordance  with  EMA  guidelines  (CPMP/EWP.205/95/Rev.3; 
CHMP/EWP/2330/99).  Additionally,  it  needs  to  be  noted  that  regorafenib  became  available  after  the  pivotal 
study was already on-going, with enrolment almost completed. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The study population in RECOURSE was similar to the general patient population with mCRC in several aspects. 
The treatment groups were comparable with respect to demographic and baseline characteristics. 
The majority of patients (60.9%) had received ≥4 prior systemic cancer therapies, and over 45% of patients in 
each group had also received ≥4 lines in the metastatic setting, indicating that this was a heavily pretreated 
population. Of note, approximately 44% of the patients in both treatment groups were over the age of 65. Since 
elderly patients represent a large portion of the target population, this is considered acceptable.  
The study did not included ECOG PS 2 patients which can be considered a limitation, due to the advanced disease 
setting, and that patients with ECOG PS 2 might represent a considerable proportion of the potential target 
population. 
There  was  a  significant  improvement  in  overall  survival  of  2.0  months  (median  7.2  months)  for  Lonsurf 
compared to the placebo (median OS 5.2 months; HR 0.69, p<0.0001).  The percentage of patients surviving at 
1 year was 27% in the Lonsurf group and 17% in the placebo group. The observed OS benefit is considered 
clinically  relevant.  The  effect  on  OS  was  observed  in  several  subgroups  of  the  population  (including  race, 
geographic  region,  age,  sex,  ECOG  PS,  KRAS  status,  time  since  diagnosis  of  first  metastasis,  number  of 
metastatic sites, and primary tumour site), with the exception of patients from Australia. The small sample size 
could potentially explain the lack of effect in this subgroup. No imbalance in post-study therapies between the 
two study arms was observed from the data provided. No OS benefit was observed in the subgroup of patients 
who received two or less prior therapies, and since PFS is consistent between subgroups with different lines of 
treatment,  the  lack  of  OS  benefit  in  this  subgroup  is  therefore  considered  to  be  caused  by  post-study 
treatments. 
Among patients who received fluoropyrimidines at their last treatment and were resistant to this last regimen, 
treatment  with  Lonsurf  was  still  efficacious  (HR=0.75,  95%  CI  [0.59  to  0.94]).  In  addition,  patients  who 
received prior treatment with regorafenib (18%) benefit of TAS 102 was similar to patients who were not treated 
with this drug (HR=0.69). 
In order to put the observed results into perspective, it is worth mentioning the results from the phase III study 
that led to the approval of regorafenib (Lancet.2013 Jan 26;381(9863):303-12), the only other agent currently 
marketed in the intended indication. Median OS was 6.4 months (IQR 3.6-11.8) in the regorafenib group and 5.0 
months (IQR 2.8-10.4) in the placebo group (HR 0.77 for regorafenib vs. placebo, 95%CI 0.64-0.94; p=0.0052). 
Median  PFS  was  1.9  months  (IQR  1.6-3.9)  and  1.7  months  (IQR  1.4-1.9)  for  regorafenib  and  placebo, 
respectively. ORR were low for both groups (1.0% and 0.4%, respectively, p=0.19) with no CR and a total of 6 
PR  (5  in  regorafenib-treated  patients  and  1  in  placebo).  Aside  from  race  and  prior  cancer  therapy,  both 
populations are very similar in terms of baseline demographic and disease characteristics. The main differences 
reside in the proportion of Asian patients included in the Lonsurf studies (approximately 34%, vs. 14% in the 
regorafenib study), minimum number of prior therapies (patients in TAS-102 study had received at least two 
prior  regimens,  vs.  at  least  1  prior  regimen  in  the  regorafenib  study)  and  the  proportion  of  patients  with 
EMA/CHMP/287846/2016 
Page 74/106 
  
  
  
available KRAS/BRAF status.  
The  OS  results  of  TAS-102  appear  to  be  supported  by  the  investigator-assessed  PFS  data.  A  statistically 
significant  increase  in  PFS  was  observed  with  TAS-102  compared  with  placebo  (HR  0.48  [0.41,  0.57],  p< 
0.0001). Median PFS was 2.0 months (95% CI 1.9-2.1) in the TAS-102 arm and 1.7 months (95% CI 1.7-1.8) 
in  the  placebo  arm.  Results  of  supportive  analyses  of  PFS  including  clinical  progression  and  initiation  of 
anti-tumour therapy as PFS events were consistent with that of the primary analysis of PFS. PFS benefit was 
maintained  across  all  specified  subgroups  (KRAS  status,  time  since  diagnosis  of  first  metastasis  and 
geographical region). 
The median time to ECOG PS ≥2 (ECOG PS 2 = ambulatory and capable of all self-care but unable to carry out 
any work activities) was longer for the Lonsurf group (5.7 months) than for the placebo group (4.0 months, HR 
of 0.66 (95% CI: 0.56, 0.78), p<0.0001). Unfortunately quality of life data was not planned when the study was 
designed as at that time, QoL instruments were not considered sensitive enough in such an advanced CRC 
patient population. Assessment of ECOG performance status might be subject of inter-physician differences.  
Other patient reported outcomes able to indirectly assess clinical benefit for patients (e.g. use of analgesics, 
pain control, other specific disease related symptoms) have not been evaluated. 
The supportive study J003-10040030 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study 
entirely conducted in Japan. A total of 172 patients who had received at least two or more chemotherapeutic 
regimens,  including  fluoropyrimidine,  irinotecan,  and  oxaliplatin,  were  randomised.  Study  design,  baseline 
population and disease characteristics (other than race and inclusion of ECOG PS 2 patients) were comparable 
with  those  of  the  pivotal  study.  In  the  supportive  study,  patients  with  ECOG  PS  =2  were  allowed  to  enrol; 
however, the total number (n=4, 3 in TAS-102, 1 in placebo) is too limited to reach any conclusions.  
In terms of efficacy results, the majority of the key results were mainly consistent with those obtained in 
RECOURSE. TAS-102 improved OS compared with placebo (median OS 9.0 and 6.6 months in the TAS-102 and 
placebo groups, respectively (HR=0.56; 95% CI: [0.39, 0.81]; p =0.0011). 
From the data presented to date a subgroup benefiting most could not be identified. Unfortunately, no 
biomarker analysis has been provided by the applicant. 
Based on the mechanism of action of FTD, the relationship between efficacy endpoints (PFS, and OS) and the 
expressions of thymidine kinase 1 (TK1, FTD activating enzyme) or thymidine phospholyrase (TP, FTD 
metabolizing enzyme) in tumours were investigated in an exploratory manner in Study J003-10040030. Using 
median cut-off data for tumour TK1 and TP, the correlation between Lonsurf clinical effects and the expression 
of TK1 or TP proteins was not observed.  
Currently, there does not appear to be a predictive marker in the metastatic CRC setting to clearly define 
subpopulations that would derive greater or no benefit from TAS-102. The applicant is recommended to submit 
the results of a biomarker study in Japanese patients evaluating the TK1 protein expression and the following 
genes ABL1, AKT1, ALK, APC, ATM, BRAF, CDH1, CDKN2A, CSF1R, CTNNB1, EGFR, ERBB2, ERBB4, FBXW7, 
FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, FLT3, GNA11, GNAQ, GNAS, HNF1A, HRAS, IDH1, JAK2, JAK3, KDR, KIT, KRAS, MET, 
MLH1, MPL, NOTCH1, NPM1, NRAS, PDGFRA, PIK3CA, PTEN, PTPN11, RB1, RET, SMAD4, SMARCB1, SMO, SRC, 
STK11, TP53, VHL and MSI status. 
The effect of TAS 102 on overall survival was similar in patients <65 years and ≥65 years of age. There were no 
patients 85 years or older in the RECOURSE study and the Japanese phase 2 study.  
EMA/CHMP/287846/2016 
Page 75/106 
  
  
  
No formal hepatic or renal impairment studies have been performed with TAS-102. The results of two PK studies 
investigating the PK of TAS-102 components/metabolites in patients with renal impairment (TO-TAS-102-107) 
and hepatic impairment (TO-TAS-102-106) will be submitted by December 2017 (see RMP).  
For patients with moderate renal impairment, efficacy seems to be less compared to patients with normal to mild 
renal impairment. However, the small sample size for patients with moderate renal impairment might affect this 
result. In patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment, benefit was also demonstrated. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The 2.0 months gain in median OS associated to treatment with TAS-102 appears to be of clinical relevance 
considering the lack of subsequent therapies. A minority (18%) of patients received regorafenib as a prior 
treatment, which has not been granted MA at the beginning of the trial. However, the benefit in OS in patients 
who received this drug was comparable to those who did not receive regorafenib. Patients who received only 2 
regimens did not benefit from TAS-102, which is considered to be due to the effect of post-study treatments, 
which are common available in these patients. No specific biomarker predictive for response to TAS-102 has 
been identified in RECOURSE. Additional analysis will be conducted post-approval as part of the exploratory 
genomic study. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The safety database of TAS 102 consisted of data from 8 clinical studies including 6 open label studies  and 2 
randomized studies (safety database group 2), in which a total of 761 mCRC patients (safety data group 1) were 
exposed to TAS 102 in the proposed dose of 35 mg/m2 bid.  
Table 43: Overview of Clinical Studies Included in Integrated Safety Database - Patients with mCRC Receiving 
Starting Dose of 35 mg/m2 BID 
Moreover, deaths and SAEs as observed in other studies performed with TAS-102 administered in with other 
dose schedules or in other indications than mCRC were reported. 
However, the safety analysis is focused on the data available from the phase 3 pivotal RECOURSE study, in 
which TAS-102 was compared with placebo in the target population. 
EMA/CHMP/287846/2016 
Page 76/106 
  
  
  
 
Patient exposure 
In  the  RECOURSE  study  798  patients  received  at  least  one  dose  of  study  medication  (533,  Lonsurf;  265, 
placebo). In patients receiving Lonsurf the average duration of treatment was higher than for patients receiving 
placebo (12.65 and 6.76 weeks, respectively). Patients who were treated with Lonsurf had a mean relative dose 
intensity per cycle of 0.886 compared to 0.944 in the placebo group.  
At the time of clinical cut-off for reporting of non-survival data (31-January 2014), 759 (95.1%) patients in the 
AT Population had discontinued study treatment and 39 patients (37, Lonsurf; 2, placebo) were continuing on 
treatment. The observed small differences in primary reasons for discontinuation of study treatment between  
the two treatment groups are not considered significant. 
Table 44: Primary Reasons for Discontinuation from Study Treatment (AT Population) 
a  NOTE:  Death  was  not  a  pre-specified  reason  for  discontinuation  on  the  eCRF.  Patients  with  reason  for  discontinuation 
indicated as “Other” with verbatim of "death" or "died" in the description field are counted here. 
b Patient 1: PI decision – “Progression due to decision of radiologist and Investigator” 
   Patient 2: Need for radiotherapy 
   Patient 3: Patient withdrew consent – “Patient decision not to continue on trial treatment” 
   Patient 4: PI decision – “Investigator decision to stop the treatment because of the hepatic progression” 
   Patient 5: Need for radiotherapy 
   Patient 6: PI decision – “Per physician discretion, overall tumor burden was increasing. It was not 
   RECIST specific, but clinically significant” 
   Patient  7:  CT  scan  report  unavailable  –  “As  suggested  by  the  Sponsor we  have changed  the reason  for     stopping  the 
treatment to Other because we do not have the Tc scan report; rdp was referred by phone” 
   Patient 8: Lack of compliance 
   Patient 9: PI decision 
c Patient 10: Radiologic progression 
In safety data group 2, more patients discontinued treatment in the placebo group (99.4%) than in the Lonsurf 
group (93.7%). The most common reason for treatment discontinuation was progression of disease, which was 
reported in 96% of patients in the placebo group compared to 84.8% of patient in the Lonsurf group. As of the 
database  cut-off,  more  patients  in  the  Lonsurf  group  (6.3%)  compared  to  placebo  group  (0.6%)  continued 
treatment. The average number of weeks of exposure per patient in Safety Data Group 2 was 12.9 weeks in the 
Lonsurf group and 6.4 weeks in the placebo group, and the median was 6.7 weeks and 5.7 weeks, respectively. 
Treatment discontinuation due to death was equally distributed between the two groups. More patients in the 
Lonsurf  group  (3.4%)  discontinued  treatment  due  to  an  AE/SAE  than  in  the  placebo  group  (1.6%),  but  the 
overall incidence was low. 
Adverse events 
Overall the type of AEs reported among Lonsurf - treated patients as observed across both safety data-groups 
was consistent.

The most frequently reported AEs in patients treated with Lonsurf were nausea, anaemia, decreased appetite, 
fatigue,  diarrhoea,  neutropenia,  neutrophil  count  decreased,  vomiting,  and  white  blood  cell  (WBC)  count 
decreased as an AE.  
The most frequently reported ≥Grade 3 treatment-related AEs were neutropenia, neutrophil count decreased,

Table 47: Treatment-Related Adverse Events Reported in ≥5% of Subjects – RECOURSE study (AT Population) 
Liver impairment 
Liver impairment-related AEs, such as jaundice and ascites were almost as frequently reported in the placebo 
group (32.3%, grade ≥3 15.8%) as in the TAS-102 group (31.8%, grade ≥3 13.2%) in safety database group 
2. Liver impairment-related AEs leading to discontinuation of treatment were more common observed in the 
placebo group (5.0%) than in the TAS-102 group (1.4%). Fatal liver impairment occurred also more frequently 
in the placebo group (2.2%) than in the TAS-102 group (0.5%). 
Renal impairment 
Renal impairment-related AEs were more frequent in the Lonsurf group (9.0% of patients) compared to the 
placebo  group  (4.9%  of  patients).  The  renal  impairment-related  AEs  with  the  greatest  frequency  difference 
between groups were proteinuria (Lonsurf, 22 [4.1%]; placebo, 5 [1.9%]); all of these AEs were of Grade 1 or 
2 severity. Renal impairment led to treatment discontinuation in 0.4% of patients in both Lonsurf and placebo 
group.

Infection related AEs 
In the TAS-102 group, infection-related AEs (including leukopenia and neutropenia) were more frequent than in 
the placebo group (73.7% and 33.2%, respectively); however, only 6 (1.1%) patients in the TAS-102 group 
discontinued treatment due to infection related AEs). Three patients in the TAS-102 group experienced fatal 
infections (i.e. sepsis, liver abscess and pneumonia).  
Table 49: Sponsor-defined Infection-related Adverse Events (AT Population) 
Treatment-related infections occurred more frequently in Lonsurf-treated patients (5.6%) compared to those 
receiving placebo (1.9%). 
Bleeding events 
Bleeding events occurred at similar rates in the TAS-102 (9.0%; grade ≥3 0.8%) and placebo group (8.7%) in 
safety database group 2.. However, the incidence of events ≥Grade 3 was lower in TAS-102 (0.8%) than on 
placebo group (3.1%). 
Thromboembolic events 
EMA/CHMP/287846/2016 
Page 81/106 
  
  
  
 
 
Thromboembolic  events  (TEEs)  were  more  frequent  in  the  TAS-102  group  (3.7%)  compared  to  the  placebo 
group (1.9%) in safety database group 2.. Of these events, nine patients experienced a pulmonary embolism 
(PE), whereas no PEs were reported in the placebo group. All PEs were ≥Grade 3, including one fatal case. Seven 
out of the 9 cases were considered unrelated to study medication, including the fatal case.  
Handfoot syndrome 
In  RECOURSE,  hand-foot  syndrome  was  equally  distributed  in  2.3%  patients  in  the  TAS-102  and  2.3%  of 
patients in the placebo group and was of low grade (1-2). 
Fatigue 
In both study groups, (35.3% (3.9% grade 3-4) for patients receiving TAS-102 and 23.4% (5.7% grade3-4) of 
patients receiving placebo, fatigue was commonly reported and in the majority of cases was considered related 
to treatment. Asthenia  was reported in 18.2% (grade 3 and 4 3.4%) of patients in the TAS-102 group  and 
11.3% (grade 3 and 4: 3.0%) of patients in the placebo group.  
QT prolongation 
In Study TPU-TAS-102-103, cardiac safety and QT prolongation correlated to PK of Lonsurf was investigated in 
30  patients    following  a  single  dose  and  following  multiple  doses  (BID  on  Days  1through  5,  followed  by  a 
recovery period from Day 6 through Day 7 and BID dosing on Days 8 through 12).  No patient had a QT, QTcF, 
or QTcB interval >500 msec at any time point; TAS-102 did not appear to be arrhythmogenic. 
Other Cardiac events 
In RECOURSE study, the overall incidence of cardiac AEs was low in both treatment groups (Lonsurf, 3.9%; 
placebo, 4.5%). In order to further examine the incidence of events related to arrhythmia versus those related 
to  cardiac  ischaemia,  AE  preferred  terms  categorized  as  either  arrhythmic  or  ischaemic  events 
(Sponsor-identified) were summarized. The overall incidence of arrhythmic events was 2.8% in the TAS-102 
group and 3.4% in the placebo group, while the incidence of cardiac ischaemic events was 0.6% and 0.4%, 
respectively. 
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) 
Consistent with the pharmacology of TAS-102, the pre-clinical toxicology profile and the mechanism of action of 
TAS-102  and  the  population  treated,  AEs  of  special  interest  (AESI)  included  myelosuppression,  and 
gastro-intestinal disorders. 
Myelosuppression 
In the pivotal RECOURSE trial, the frequency of haematologic impairment-related AEs, primarily neutropenia, 
anaemia and other events associated with myelosuppression, was much higher in the TAS-102 group (70.9%) 
than in the placebo group (15.5%). 
In 0.3% of patients in the TAS-102 group, the occurrence of anaemia led to treatment discontinuation in the 
TAS-102 group.  Blood transfusion was administered to 16.9% of patients. 
Treatment  related  neutropenia  events  were  generally  manageable  with  reductions  in  dose,  delays  in  cycle 
initiation  and  occasional  use  of  granulocyte  colony-stimulating  factor  (G-CSF;  9.4%  of  patients  receiving 
TAS-102. The incidences of febrile neutropenia leading to hospitalisation in the TAS-102 and placebo groups 
were 2.6% and 0.0%, respectively. In 0.2% neutropenia led to treatment discontinuation of TAS-102. Three 
(0.5%) patients died of fatal infections related to TAS-102. 
Gastro-intestinal disorders 
EMA/CHMP/287846/2016 
Page 82/106 
  
  
  
In the RECOURSE study, treatment related GI disorders occurred more frequently in the TAS-102 arm compared 
to the placebo arm. Stomatitis was reported in 7.9% of patients receiving TAS-102 compared to 6.0% of those 
receiving  placebo,  with  a  very  low  rate  of  Grade  3/4  stomatitis  (0.4%)  in  the  TAS-102  group,  which  was 
manageable.  Mucosal  inflammation  was  reported  for  5.6%  of  patients  in  the  TAS-102  group  and  4.5%  of 
patients in the placebo group. 
Dose reduction and dose delays 
In the TAS-102 group of Safety Data Group 2, a total of 95 (14.7%) patients had dose reductions: 69 (10.7%) 
patients  had  a  single  dose  reduction,  23  (3.6%)  patients  had  2  reductions,  and  3  (0.5%)  patients  had  ≥3 
reductions. In the placebo group, 0.9% of patients had one dose reduction. The median number of cycles until 
the first dose reduction was 3.0 (range 2 to 13). In RECOURSE study, The most frequent AEs leading to dose 
reduction  in  the  TAS-102  group  were:  neutropenia  (17  [3.2%]),  anaemia  (11  [2.1%]),  neutrophil  count 
decreased (10 [1.9%]), febrile neutropenia (10 [1.9%),] fatigue (8 [1.5%]), and diarrhoea (7 [1.3%]) 
Dose delays occurred frequently in the TAS-102 group: More than half (56.0%) of patients experienced a delay 
of ≥4 days in initiation of at least 1 cycle, and 26.4% of patients who initiated ≥2 cycles) experienced a delay of 
≥8 days in initiation of at least 1 cycle. Almost half of the total of TAS-102 cycles ( 49.1%) were delayed by at 
least 4 days and 13.8% were delayed by at least 8 days. The median number of cycles delayed by ≥4 days was 
2.0 (range 1-14); and the median number of cycles delayed by ≥8 days was 1.0 (range: 1-6) Delays in cycle 
initiation were primarily due to neutropenia/decreased neutrophil count and anaemia. 
Adverse drug reactions as reflected in the product information 
The following criteria were used to establish causal relationship of the AE with Lonsurf: 
AEs  were  considered  as  related  if  it  follows  a  reasonable  temporal  sequence  from  administration  of  study 
medication and, one of the following conditions is true: positive de-challenge or re-challenge or the event cannot 
be reasonably explained by the patient’s clinical state and/or other administered therapies. 
AEs were considered as not related when there is no reasonable possibility that the study medication caused the 
event. Reasonable possibility is illustrated by the following examples:  
- a single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with drug exposure; 
- one or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly associated with drug exposure, but is otherwise 
uncommon in the population exposed to drug  
-  an  aggregate  analysis  of  specific  events  in  a  clinical  trial  (such  as  known  consequences  of  the  underlying 
disease  or  condition  under  investigation  or  other  events  that  commonly  occur  in  the  study  population 
independent of drug therapy) that indicates those events occur more frequently in the drug treatment group 
than in a concurrent or historical control group. 
The table below provides the list of ADRs and their respective frequencies.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Data from randomized trials (Safety Data Group 2) showed that SAEs were reported for 27.7% of patients in the 
Lonsurf group and 29.2% of patients in the placebo group, while treatment-related SAEs were reported for 9.8% 
of patients in the Lonsurf group and 0.6% of patients in the placebo group. Most common treatment related 
SAEs for TAS-102 were febrile neutropenia (2.8%) and anaemia (1.5%).  
Gastrointestinal  SAEs  were  reported  for  7.1%  of  patients  in  the  Lonsurf  group  and  8.4%  of  patients  in  the 
placebo group, but were considered treatment-related in only 2.2% of patients in the Lonsurf group and 0.3% 
of patients in the placebo group. The most frequent gastrointestinal SAEs in the Lonsurf group were abdominal 
pain (1.4%) and vomiting (1.1%). Serious infections were reported for 4.8% of patients in the Lonsurf group 
(2.3% treatment related) and 4.3% in the placebo group (0.3% treatment related). 
Fatal adverse events from Safety Data Groups 1 and 2 are summarised in the table below. One fatal (Grade 5) 
AE in the TAS-102 group (septic shock) was considered related to study treatment in the Safety Data Group 2. 
Additional fatal AEs reported in Safety Data Group 1 included haematochezia, staphylococcal infection, and an 
additional case of septic shock (1 patient each). These additional fatal (Grade 5) AEs were not considered related 
to study medication.

Laboratory findings 
In  the  pivotal  RECOURSE  trial  37.9%  of  patients  in  the  TAS-102  group  experienced  Grade  3  or  Grade  4 
neutropenia and 113 (21.4%) patients experienced Grade 3 or 4 leukopenia during treatment, while no Grade 
3 or 4 values were observed for these parameters in the placebo group. Grade 3 or 4 lymphocytopenia (18.2%), 
anaemia  (18.2%)  and  thrombocytopenia  (4.5%)  were  all  more  frequent  in  the  TAS-102  group  than  in  the 
placebo group. Median haemoglobin, neutrophil counts and thrombocytes gradually decreases with start but 
remained stable from cycle 4,1, and 3 respectively. 
Table 52: Grade 3 or 4 Abnormalities in Haematology Parameters that Worsened from Baseline (AT 
Population) in RECOURSE 
Median time to recovery in patients receiving TAS-102 were 28 days (range 1-217) for haemoglobin,  8 days for 
neutrophils (range 1-56), and 15 days (range 1-30) for platelets.  
Serum chemistry abnormalities were equally distributed between the TAS-102 group and the placebo group. 
Serum glucose increase Grade 3 elevations in glucose were more frequently observed in the TAS-102 group 
(6.2%) compared to (2.4%) the placebo group, and is considered to be caused by an imbalance at baseline. 
Safety in special populations 
Renal impairment 
Of  the  533  patients  in  the  RECOURSE  study  who  received  TAS-102,  306  (57%)  patients  had  normal  renal 
function (CLcr ≥90 mL/min), 178 (33%) patients had mild renal impairment (CLcr 60-89 mL/min), and 47 (9%) 
had moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30-59 mL/min), Patients with severe renal impairment were not enrolled 
in the study.

Page 88/106 
  
  
  
 
Table 53: Overview of Adverse Events by Baseline Renal Function – Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (AT 
Population). RECOURSE study 
In patients with moderate renal impairment, a higher incidence of ≥Grade 3 AEs and SAEs compared to the 
other 2 subgroups was observed in safety database group 2 receiving Lonsurf. The incidence of dose reductions 
was also increased in patients with renal impairment: based on baseline CLcr in 11.2%, 17.6%, and 23.9%, for 
normal, mild, and moderate renal impairment respectively. Also, drug interruptions occurred more frequently 
with moderate renal impairment: among patients in Safety Data Group 2 receiving Lonsurf, the incidence of 
drug interruption in normal, mild, and moderate group patients based on baseline CLcr was 28.7%, 26.7%, 
and38.8%, respectively. Cycle initiation delays of ≥8 days were observed in 69 of 314 (22.0%) patients with 
normal renal function, 57 of 179 (31.8%) patients with mild renal impairment, and 18 of 51(35.3%) patients 
with moderate renal impairment based on baseline CLcr.  
Hepatic impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride have not been studied in patients with moderate 
or severe hepatic impairment. In RECOURSE, in the Lonsurf group, no marked safety differences were observed 
between patients with normal function and mild hepatic dysfunction. There were only 5 patients with moderate 
hepatic impairment (1 patient treated with TAS-102 and 4 patients on placebo). 
Age 
No particular concern exists for use in the elderly population, although a higher incidence and severity of blood 
and lymphatic disorders and cardiac events might be expected in the elderly population as compared to adult 
subjects. Patients 65 years of age or older who received Lonsurf had a higher incidence of the following events 
compared to patients younger than 65 years: Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (48% vs 30%), Grade 3 anaemia (26% 
vs 12%), Grade 3 or 4 leucopenia (26% vs 18%) and Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia (9% vs 2%).   
EMA/CHMP/287846/2016 
Page 89/106 
  
  
  
 
Table 54: Overview of Adverse Events by Age Group (AT Population) 
In RECOURSE, only 45 patients were aged >75 years. In this particular subgroup of patients, AEs were more 
common than in patients ≥65 to <75 years and mainly included anaemia (46.7% vs. 40.2%), abdominal pain 
(20.0% vs. 14.1% constipation (22.2% vs. 12.9%), pyrexia (24.4% vs. 17.4%), hypoalbuminemia (8.9% vs. 
2.5%), dizziness (8.9% vs. 3.3%), dyspnoea (17.8% vs. 7.5), and dry skin (8.9% vs 3.7%). 
The review of AEs in the safety Data group 1 and 2 did not show emerging pattern in the incidence of events 
between the age groups except for cardiac events where an increase would be expected (see tables below).

Radiotherapy 
There was a slightly higher incidence of overall haematological and myelosuppression-related adverse reactions 
for  patients  who  received  prior  radiotherapy  compared  to  patients  without  prior  radiotherapy  in  RECOURSE 
(54.6% versus 49.2%, respectively), of note febrile neutropenia was higher in Lonsurf-treated patients who 
received prior radiotherapy vs. those who did not. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Intrinsic Factors 
Gender 
In female patients receiving TAS-102 group in Safety Data Group 2, AEs that were  reported more than in men  
included  anaemia  (36.7%  vs  31.3%),  abdominal  pain  (19.1%  vs  13.3%),  abdominal  pain  upper  (10.2%  vs 
3.6%), nausea (58.6% vs 46.4%), vomiting (41.0% vs 20.8%), and cough (13.3% vs 7.4%).  Anaemia (9.2% 
vs 5.2%), abdominal pain (15.4% vs 13.5%, abdominal pain upper 3.8% vs 3.6%, nausea 31.5% vs 19.8%, 
EMA/CHMP/287846/2016 
Page 92/106 
  
  
  
 
 
vomiting 23.1% vs 11.5%, and cough 12.3% vs 8.9% were also more frequently observed in the placebo group. 
Female patients in the TAS-102 group had also a higher incidence of  grade 3-4 neutropenia than male patients; 
this abnormality was not observed in the placebo group . 
ECOG performance status 
In both TAS-102 and placebo groups in safety group 2, ≥Grade 3 AEs and serious AEs were more frequent for 
patients with PS=1-2 at baseline compared to those with PS=0 at baseline. AE which were more reported in the 
ECOG 1/2 group than in the ECOG 0 group receiving TAS-102 were vomiting (31.9% vs 26.5%) and oedema 
peripheral (13.6% vs 8.0%), but a difference was also reported in the placebo group. 
Race 
Grade 3 or higher AE were reported in 70,5% of Caucasians/Whites, 75% (n=4) of African Americans , and 
67.6% of Asians patients receiving TAS-102. In the placebo group, grade 3 or higher AE were less reported in 
Asians (36.4%), compared to Caucasians/Whites (51.9%) and African Americans (60.0%, n=5). It should be 
noted that few data exists in the African American population. 
Extrinsic Factors 
Drug Interactions 
The effect of food on PK of TAS-102 was investigated in Study J004-10040040, a single-center, open-label, 
2-group, 2-period crossover, PK study of TAS-102 administered to patients with solid tumours. The patients 
received single doses of TAS-102 (35 mg/m2) under two conditions, assigned in random order: fasting condition 
and after a meal. Sixteen patients were enrolled in the study, and 14 patients were included in the evaluation of 
the food effect. The results showed that food consumption did not affect the AUC of FTD, but reduced the Cmax 
of FTD and the Cmax and AUC of TPI by about 40%. The AUC of FTD, the antitumor component of TAS-102, was 
generally the same between fed and fasting states; a possible decrease in exposure to FTD and TPI due to food 
consumption was considered unlikely to affect the efficacy of TAS-102. 
However,  a  significant  correlation  between  the  increase  in  the  Cmax  of  FTD  and  the  decrease  in  neutrophil 
counts, observed in the dose-finding study of TAS-102 conducted in Japan (Study  J001-10040010), suggests 
that TAS-102 should be administered in a fed state in which the Cmax is lower, rather than in a fasting state. 
No clinical drug interaction studies of TAS-102 have been performed. 
Geographical region 
Analysis of safety data by geographic region was performed for Safety Data Group 2. In both treatment groups, 
treatment-related AEs  were more frequent in Japanese patients than in US/EU/Australia patients, and  SAEs 
were more frequent in US/EU/Australia patients than in Japanese patients. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Discontinuation of treatment 
In the RECOURSE study, 3.6% of patients in the TAS-102 group and 1.5% of patients in the placebo group had 
adverse event/SAE indicated as the primary reason for discontinuation of study treatment based on the 
treatment discontinuation page of the eCRF. The most frequent AEs leading to discontinuation in the TAS-102 
group (at least 3 patients) were general physical health deterioration (2.3% of patients), fatigue (1.1%) and 
dyspnoea (0.6%); while in the placebo group, the most frequent AEs leading to discontinuation (at least 3 
patients) were blood bilirubin increased (2.3%), general physical health deterioration (1.9%), ascites (1.9%), 
decreased appetite (1.5%), hepatic failure (1.1%), abdominal pain (1.1%) and asthenia (1.1%). All other AEs 
leading to DC were reported for 2 or fewer patients in either group. 
EMA/CHMP/287846/2016 
Page 93/106 
  
  
  
Dose reduction 
In the RECOURSE study, 73 (13.7%) patients in the TAS-102 group had at least 1 dose reduction during 
treatment. Adverse events leading to dose reduction were reported for 72 of these patients. The most frequent 
AEs leading to dose reduction in the TAS-102 group were: neutropenia (17, 3.2%), anaemia (11, 2.1%), 
neutrophil count decreased (10, 1.9%), febrile neutropenia (10, 1.9%), fatigue (8, 1.5%), and diarrhoea (7, 
1.3%). In the placebo group, 3 (1.1%) patients had a single dose reduction, with 2 reporting AEs leading to dose 
reduction (1, anaemia; 1, bronchopneumonia). Across all cycles, 289 (54.2%) patients in the TAS-102 group 
had AEs that resulted in interruptions in dosing, dose delays and/or dose reductions compared to 36 (13.6%) 
patients in the placebo group.  
Dose interruption or delay 
In terms of dose delays, cycles delayed ≥4 days were more frequently reported for TAS-102 than placebo 
(52.6% vs. 6.5%). In the TAS-102 group, the most frequent AEs leading to interruptions/delays and/or dose 
reductions were: neutrophil count decreased (109, 20.5%), neutropenia (106, 19.9%), and anaemia (29, 
5.4%). In the placebo group, the most frequent AEs leading to these outcomes (in at least 3 patients) were: 
decreased appetite (5, 1.9%) and pyrexia (3, 1.1%). 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile of TAS-102 (Lonsurf) was consistent across studies and is attributable to the 
antineoplastic agent trifluridine and typical for a myelosuppressive agent: haematological toxicity was most 
prominent in the pivotal RECOURSE study. 
The safety profile of TAS-102, with mainly bone marrow related and GI related AEs, appears predictable, 
manageable and well tolerated by the heavily pretreated target population. According to the RECOURSE study 
protocol, patients were selected on the basis of lack of significant hepatic or renal co-morbidities, CNS 
metastases, cardiac disease, uncontrolled hypertension and diabetes mellitus and gastrointestinal 
haemorrhage.  Also, only patients with ECOG 0 or 1 performance status were allowed to be enrolled in the 
pivotal study.  
RECOURSE Study 
At the time of the non-survival data cut-off (31-January-2014), the majority of patients (n=759, 95.1%) had 
discontinued treatment, and 39 patients (37 and 2, in the TAS-102 and placebo groups, respectively) continued 
on treatment. 
The main reason for discontinuation in both groups was (clinical/radiological) disease progression. The 
proportion of patients discontinuing due to AEs was in general low, with a higher percentage of patients 
discontinuing in the TAS-102 group.  
The  most  frequent  reason  for  dose  reduction  and/or  cycle  delays  in  the  TAS-102  treated  patients  were 
haematological-related AES. Data provided are within the expected range and show an increased incidence of 
AEs  and  G3/4  haematological  AEs  in  patients  previously  exposed  to  RT  or  who  received  more  lines  of  prior 
chemotherapy  regimens.  Given  the  overall  low  rate  of  treatment  discontinuations,  haematological  events 
appear well tolerated and manageable in clinical practice. 
Despite the high incidence of dose delays, there was very little difference (2%) between the number of cycles 
initiated and completed, indicating good tolerability and no evidence for cumulative toxicity. 
The most common treatment-related AEs for the Lonsurf-treated patients were: nausea, anaemia, decrease 
appetite, fatigue, diarrhoea, neutropenia, neutrophil count decreased, vomiting, and WBC count decreased, all 
EMA/CHMP/287846/2016 
Page 94/106 
  
  
  
of them reported in >20% patients. The frequency of hematologic impairment-related AEs, primarily 
neutropenia, anaemia, leucopenia, and thrombocytopenia associated with myelosuppression, was much higher 
in the Lonsurf group (70.9%) than in the placebo group (15.5%).  
Haematological toxicity is considered an expected AE for this class of products. The clinical management of 
these toxicities, in terms of dose adjustments and/or the use of supportive haematological therapies have been 
adequately provided by the Applicant.  
Complete blood cell counts must be obtained prior to initiation of therapy and as needed to monitor toxicity, but 
at a minimum, prior to each treatment cycle.  
Treatment must not be started if the absolute neutrophil count is < 1.5 x109/L, if the platelet counts are < 75x  
109/L, or if the patient has an unresolved Grade 3 or 4 non-haematological clinically relevant toxicity from prior 
therapies.  
Serious infections have been reported following treatment with Lonsurf (see section 4.8). Given that the 
majority were reported in the context of bone marrow suppression, the patient’s condition should be monitored 
closely, and appropriate measures, such as antimicrobial agents and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor 
(G-CSF), should be administered as clinically indicated. In the RECOURSE study, 9.4% of patients in the Lonsurf 
group received G-CSF mainly for therapeutic use (see section 4.4 of the SmPC). 
GI events were commonly observed with the administration of Lonsurf. The degree of emetogenicity attributed 
to Lonsurf is substantial. Considering the health and QoL impact of nausea and vomiting, even of further 
magnitude in this advanced disease setting, instructions for preventive measurements have been adequately 
reflected. Patients with nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and other gastrointestinal toxicities should be carefully 
monitored, and anti-emetic, anti-diarrhoeal and other measures, such as fluid/electrolyte replacement therapy, 
should be administered as clinically indicated. Dose modifications (delay and/or reduction) should be applied as 
necessary (see sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC).  
Overall, the safety profile of Lonsurf seems to be generally in line with that of a thymidine nucleotide analogue. 
The main differences observed were that mucositis (reported as “mucosal inflammation” or “stomatitis”, 
respectively 5.6% and 7.9% for Lonsurf and 4.5% and 6.0% for placebo) and hand-foot syndrome adverse 
events (2.3% in both treatment groups), were reported with lower incidence that those found in the literature 
(up to 50%). Most of the events were grade 1-2 (<1% grade >3 in Lonsurf, 0% placebo). 
As for maximum CTC grade, the majority (78.4%) of Lonsurf patients experienced AEs of maximum grade ≤3 
(28.9% Grade 1-2, 49.5% Grade 3), with anaemia (15.9%), neutropenia (13.7%),  neutrophil count decreased 
(11.8%), and WBC count decrease (9.2%) as the most commonly reported grade 3 events and neutropenia 
(6.4%) and neutrophil count decreased (4.1%) as the most frequent grade 4 AEs.  
In both treatment groups, frequencies of treatment-related AEs followed similar trends to those observed for all 
causality AEs, with a higher percentage of treatment-related AEs in the Lonsurf group than the placebo group 
(85.7% vs. 54.7%, respectively). Grade ≥3 treatment-related AEs were also more frequent for Lonsurf patients 
(49.0% vs. 9.8% in the placebo group). 
In the pivotal RECOURSE study the number of patients receiving the target dose of Lonsurf administered 
decreases with the number of cycles.  Although it is observed that dose interruptions in the Lonsurf group 
occurred more frequently in the second or subsequent cycles, suggesting late or cumulative toxicity, the median 
relative dose intensity was still 91.2% in the Lonsurf group and only 3.4% of patients discontinued treatment, 
suggesting that the proposed dosing regimen is manageable.  
EMA/CHMP/287846/2016 
Page 95/106 
  
  
  
The most common reason for treatment discontinuation was progression of disease and although the number of 
patients who discontinued Lonsurf due to AE/SAE was higher in the Lonsurf group (3.4%) than in the placebo 
group (1.6%), the absolute numbers are low. 
From safety database group 2 data, the most frequently reported treatment-related AEs were anaemia, 
neutropenia, neutrophil count decreased, decreased appetite, and WBC count decreased  and nausea.  
Safety data group 1 and 2 were generally in line, including exposure and reasons for discontinuation. 
Special populations 
No marked safety differences were observed between patients with normal function and mild hepatic 
dysfunction. In patients with moderate renal impairment, a higher incidence of ≥Grade 3 AEs, SAEs, incidence 
of dose reductions and, drug interruptions were observed. In addition, a higher exposure of trifluridine and 
tipiracil was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment, compared with patients with normal renal 
function or patients with mild renal impairment. Patients with moderate renal impairment should be more 
frequently monitored for haematological toxicities (see sections 4.4 and 5.2 of the SmPC). 
It is however agreed that no dose adjustments can be recommended for patients with mild to moderate renal 
impairment for the time being Patients with severe renal impairment were not enrolled in the RECOURSE study.  
Lonsurf is therefore not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal 
disease. 
A study in patients with renal impairment is ongoing and study results will be submitted by December 2017 (see 
RMP). 
Lonsurf is not recommended for use in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (National Cancer 
Institute [NCI] Criteria Group C and D) as Lonsurf has not been studied in these patients (see section 4.4 of the 
SmPC). A study in patients with hepatic impairment is ongoing and study results will be submitted by December 
2017 (see RMP). 
In the Lonsurf group, AEs were more frequently reported in patients >65 years than in patients <65 years of age 
and mainly included anaemia, neutropenia, neutrophil count decreased, platelet count decreased, and white 
blood cell count decreased.  The data in patients >75 years are limited but do suggest higher toxicity. Since an 
a priori decrease in dose could potentially negatively impact efficacy and the difference in toxicity is not 
considered significant, no adjustment of the starting dose is required in patients ≥ 65 years old (see sections 
4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC). 
AEs were more frequent in Japanese patients than in US/EU/Australia patients, and SAEs were more frequent in 
US/EU/Australia patients than in Japanese patients, which might be due to differences in reporting. AEs were 
equally distributed among races. There is limited data on Lonsurf in Black/African American patients but there is 
no biological rationale to expect any difference between this subgroup and the overall population (see section 
4.2 of the SmPC). 
AEs Grade ≥3 and serious AEs were more frequently reported in patients with ECOG PS1-2 at baseline compared 
to those with PS=0 at baseline. AE which were more reported in the ECOG PS1-2 group than with PS=0 group 
receiving TAS-102 were vomiting (31.9% vs 26.5%) and oedema peripheral (13.6% vs 8.0%), but a difference 
was also reported in the placebo group. 
Lonsurf had no clinically relevant effect on QT/QTc prolongation compared with placebo in an open label study 
in patients with advanced solid tumours. 
EMA/CHMP/287846/2016 
Page 96/106 
  
  
  
There are no data available on the effects of Lonsurf on human fertility. There are no available data from the use 
of Lonsurf in pregnant women. Based on the mechanism of action, trifluridine is suspected to cause congenital 
malformations when administered during pregnancy. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity. 
Lonsurf should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with 
Lonsurf (see sections 4.6 and 5.3 of the SmPC).  
The highest dose of Lonsurf administered in clinical trials was 180 mg/m2 per day. The adverse drug reactions 
reported in association with overdoses were consistent with the established safety profile. The primary 
anticipated complication of an overdose is bone marrow suppression. There is no known antidote for an 
overdose of Lonsurf. Medical management of an overdose should include customary therapeutic and supportive 
medical intervention aimed at correcting the presenting clinical manifestations and preventing their possible 
complications (see section 4.9 of the SmPC). 
Since Lonsurf contains lactose, patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase 
deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine (see section 4.4 of the SmPC). 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary 
of Product Characteristics 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile of TAS-102 (Lonsurf) was consistent across studies and is attributable to the 
antineoplastic agent trifluridine and typical for a myelosuppressive agent: haematological toxicity was most 
prominent in the pivotal RECOURSE study. Nausea and vomiting were reported frequently and it should be 
questioned whether patients adequately received supportive therapies. Overall, the toxicity related to TAS-102 
treatment appears to be manageable, and seems, in some aspects such as the absence of mucositis to be better 
tolerable than fluoropyrimidines. More data on safety in patients with renal and hepatic impairment are awaited.

2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the applicant 
show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of 
the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Lonsurf (trifluridine / tipiracil) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as: 
•  It contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal 
product authorised in the EU; 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
A statistically significant improvement in OS with TAS-102 plus BSC (7.2 months) compared with placebo plus 
BSC (5.2 months) has been observed in the pivotal RECOURSE study. The hazard ratio for death (TAS-102 
versus placebo) was 0.69 (95% CI, 0.59-0.81; p<0.001). The 1-year overall survival rates were 27% and 17% 
respectively. The 2 months gain in median OS associated to treatment with TAS-102 appears to be of clinical 
relevance considering the lack of subsequent therapies and the poor prognosis of this patient population. The 
investigator-assessed PFS results appear to support the OS data (secondary endpoint). Treatment with TAS-102 
decreased the risk of death by 31% compared with placebo (HR 0.69 [95% CI: 0.59, 0.81], and 1- and 2-sided 
p<0.0001, stratified log-rank test).  
Treatment effect on OS was robust after adjustment for stratification factors in multivariate analysis and was 
consistently favourable across the stratification groups (KRAS status, time since diagnosis of 1st metastasis, 
and geographical region) and all pre-specified subgroups. This effect was further substantiated by the results of 
the key secondary efficacy endpoint: PFS HR=0.48, 95% CI: 0.41-0.57, p<0.0001. Results obtained for other 
secondary efficacy endpoints (TTF, ORR, DCR and DR) were also supportive.  
EMA/CHMP/287846/2016 
Page 101/106 
  
  
  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
Unfortunately the results of the biomarker analysis, which could potentially help in order to identify parameters 
for patient selection, have not been provided for the pivotal RECOURSE study. In the phase II Japanese Study 
J003-10040030 the expression of TK and TPase proteins were not related to efficacy endpoints (DCR, PFS and 
OS) in either group. MSI status and TK1 as possible biomarkers will be further explored in a selected Japanese 
subpopulation from the phase III RECOURSE study. The included population is the most favourable within the 
generally unfavourable late stage mCRC having failed several prior chemotherapy regimens (e.g. ECOG PS=0-1 
patients). Another limitation is the limited characterisation of Lonsurf in the elderly population. However, the 
effect of TAS 102 on overall survival was similar in patients <65 years and ≥65 years of age.   
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Overall, the safety profile of TAS-102 was consistent across studies and is attributable to the antineoplastic 
agent trifluridine and typical for a myelosuppressive agent: in addition to gastrointestinal AEs haematological 
toxicity was most prominent in the pivotal RECOURSE study. 
The most frequently reported treatment-related AEs were anaemia, neutropenia, neutrophil count decreased, 
decreased appetite, and WBC count decreased and nausea. In the pivotal RECOURSE trial, the frequency of 
haematologic  impairment-related  AEs,  primarily  neutropenia,  anaemia  and  other  events  associated  with 
myelosuppression, was much higher in the TAS-102 group (70.9%) than in the placebo group (15.5%). 
Treatment related anaemia was more frequently reported for TAS-102 (31.3% (grade ≥3, 12.2%)) than for 
placebo  (4.5  (grade  ≥3  1.9).  Patients  with  higher  trifluridine  exposure  had  an  increased  risk  of  Grade  ≥3 
neutropenia. These events were generally manageable with reductions in dose, delays in cycle initiation and 
occasional use of G-CSF (9.4% of patients receiving TAS-102). Three (0.5%) patients died due to fatal infections 
related to TAS-102. 
GI events were commonly observed with the administration of TAS-102. Treatment related diarrhoea, nausea 
and vomiting were commonly reported and occurred more frequently in the TAS 102 group than in the placebo 
group.  
No effect of TAS-102 on QTc prolongation or other cardiac events have been observed. Thromboembolic events 
(TEEs) were more frequent in the TAS-102 group (3.7%) compared to the placebo group (1.9%). 
Treatment-related SAEs were reported for 9.8% of patients in the TAS-102 group and 0.6% of patients in the 
placebo group. Most common treatment related SAEs for TAS-102 were febrile neutropenia and anaemia.  
Overall, the safety profile of TAS-102 seems to be generally in line with that of a thymidine nucleotide analogue. 
Renal impairment-related AEs (all grades) were more frequent in the TAS-102 group than placebo (9.0% vs. 
4.9%, respectively). Considering the advanced stage of the intended target population, any deleterious effect on 
renal function is considered relevant, especially due to potential toxicity implications. Adequate information on 
the monitoring/management of these events has been included in the SmPC. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
An important limitation of the safety database is the short median duration of follow-up of patients treated with 
TAS-102.  
In patients with moderate renal impairment, a higher incidence of Grade ≥ 3 AEs and SAEs was observed. A 
EMA/CHMP/287846/2016

study in patients with renal impairment is ongoing and study results are awaited. In the meantime, no specific 
dose recommendation for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment is warranted.

Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The efficacy results of the pivotal RECOURSE study are considered of clinical relevance. A statistically significant 
improvement in OS (HR 0.69) associated with treatment with TAS-102 compared with placebo, and supported 
by a statistically significant improvement in PFS (HR 0.48) is observed. The gain in median OS is 2.0 months, 
whereas the median improvement in PFS consists of a few weeks at best (formally the difference in median PFS 
between  treatment  arms  was  only  0.3  months).  However,  such  subgroup  has  not  been  identified  so  far. 
Symptom-related endpoints and quality of life scores are not available, but dose reductions, dose interruptions, 
or discontinuations were not excessively frequent.  
The  toxicity  profile  of  TAS-102  is  more  or  less  comparable  with  fluoropyrimidines  and  typical  for  a 
myelosuppressive agent. In addition to gastrointestinal AEs, haematological toxicity was most prominent; the 
limited occurrence of mucositis in patients receiving TAS-102 is considered favourable. Overall, the safety issues 
with  TAS-102  are  manageable,  although  it  is  questioned  whether  patients  were  adequately  supported  with 
anti-emetics, due to the high incidence of nausea and vomiting. Additional recommendations for prevention and 
management have been addressed in the SmPC. Other toxicities frequently associated with this class of product 
(e.g. mucositis, and hand-foot syndrome) which are known to have a major impact on patient´s QoL, were 
reported with low frequency. This is particularly relevant in the context of non-curative therapy for an end-stage 
disease. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The benefit of TAS-102 in terms of OS needs to be weighed against observed drug-related toxicity, in particular 
haematological toxicity and GI-symptoms like diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting. While these are significant AEs 
that affect quality of life, the majority of these events were mild to moderate, had limited impact on treatment 
continuity,  and  were  generally  treated  without  requiring  hospitalisation.  Overall,  the  safety  issues  were 
manageable. Therefore, the benefit-risk is considered positive. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
For patients whose colorectal cancer has been treated with, and has proven refractory to, fluoropyrimidines, 
oxaliplatin, irinotecan, an anti-VEGF therapy, and an anti-EGFR inhibitor in case of KRAS wild-type tumours, 
therapeutic  options  that  provide  overall  survival  or  clinical  benefit  remain  limited.  Current  National 
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines list three options: regorafenib, participation in a clinical trial 
or best supportive care. 
Although no direct comparison has been performed, the efficacy shown by TAS-102 can be considered in line 
with that obtained with regorafenib, recently authorised for use in a similar setting. The safety profile of Lonsurf 
is  distinct  from  that  of  regorafenib.  Unfortunately,  comparative  data  are  lacking  since  regorafenib  was  not 
EMA/CHMP/287846/2016

licensed at the time of clinical evaluation of Lonsurf. 
The subgroup analyses in RECOURSE presented so far did not identify a subgroup benefitting most from the 
treatment on the basis of tumour characteristics. No biomarker analyses have been provided in RECOURSE. The 
Applicant is recommended to provide data from the ongoing study in selected Japanese subpopulation from the 
phase III RECOURSE study regarding MSI status, TK1 protein expression and other biomarkers which may also 
be relevant. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
risk-benefit balance of Lonsurf in the treatment of adult patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) who 
have been previously treated with, or are not considered candidates for, available therapies including 
fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based chemotherapies, anti-VEGF agents, and anti EGFR agents, 
is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions:

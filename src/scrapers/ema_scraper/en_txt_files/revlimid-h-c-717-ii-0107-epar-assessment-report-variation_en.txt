Lenalidomide (Revlimid) is an analogue of thalidomide with immunomodulatory, antiangiogenic, and 
antineoplastic properties (Revlimid Summary of Product Characteristics [SmPC], 2017). Cellular activities 
of lenalidomide are mediated by binding to its target cereblon, a component of a cullinring E3 ubiquitin 
ligase enzyme complex. In vitro, in the presence of drug, substrate proteins (including Aiolos, Ikaros, and 
CK1α) are recruited to cereblon and targeted for ubiquitination and subsequent proteosomal degradation 
leading to direct cytotoxic and immunomodulatory effects. In vitro, lenalidomide inhibits proliferation and 
induces apoptosis of certain hematopoietic tumour cells including multiple myeloma, mantle cell 
lymphoma (MCL), and del (5q) myelodysplastic syndromes, FL, and MZL. 
Immunomodulatory properties of lenalidomide include increased number and activation of T and natural 
killer (NK) cells leading to direct and enhanced antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) via 
increased secretion of interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma, increased numbers of NKT cells, and inhibition 
of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., tumour necrosis factor alpha [TNF-α] and interleukin-6 [IL-6]) by 
monocytes.

A marketing authorisation has been granted for Revlimid in the following indications: 
•  Multiple myeloma 
Revlimid as monotherapy is indicated for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with newly 
diagnosed multiple myeloma who have undergone autologous stem cell transplantation. 
Revlimid as combination therapy (see section 4.2) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients 
with previously untreated multiple myeloma who are not eligible for transplant. 
Revlimid in combination with dexamethasone is indicated for the treatment of multiple myeloma in 
adult patients who have received at least one prior therapy. 
•  Myelodysplastic syndromes 
Revlimid as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with transfusion-dependent 
anaemia due to low- or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes associated with an isolated 
deletion 5qcytogenetic abnormality when other therapeutic options are insufficient or inadequate. 
•  Mantle cell lymphoma 
Revlimid as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory 
mantle cell lymphoma 
Problem statement 
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a heterogeneous group of lymphoproliferative malignancies with 
differing patterns of behavior and responses to treatment that vary from indolent (iNHL) to aggressive 
malignancies. 
Follicular lymphoma and MZL are 2 major types of iNHLs; FL is the most common subtype of iNHL, 
constituting approximately 70% of iNHLs and approximately 20% to 25% of all NHLs (Bello, 2012; 
Sousou, 2010), followed by MZL (approximately 5% to 17% of all NHLs) 
Follicular lymphoma originates from germinal center (GC) B cells and is characterized by a nodular growth 
pattern (Kahl, 2016; Smith, 2013). The FL cells consist of a mixture of centrocytes (small to medium 
sized cells) and centroblasts (large cells). A higher proportion of centroblasts correlates with the grade of 
the disease (Kahl, 2016). The WHO adopted grading from 1 to 3 based on the number of centroblasts 
counted per high power field (DeVita, 2014; Kahl, 2016; Smith, 2013). Grade 3 is often further 
subdivided into Grades 3a and 3b. Grade 3a is typically treated similarly to Grade 1 or 2 FL, while Grade 
3b is treated as an aggressive lymphoma (Kahl, 2016; Smith, 2013). 
In Europe, an incidence of approximately 5 per 100,000 person years for FL was reported during the 
period from 1996 to 2004. An incidence rate in Europe for MZL of 0.42 per 100,000 persons was 
estimated. 
Follicular lymphoma is clinically characterized by disseminated disease at diagnosis, a generally indolent 
clinical course, and recurrent, increasingly treatment-resistant relapses. Most patients experience multiple 
relapses requiring multiple lines of treatment until eventually patients exhaust treatment options and 
develop fatal disease resistant to available therapy. The response rate, quality of response (CR versus 
partial response [PR], DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) progressively 
decrease with each successive treatment.  
The main goal of treatment in the previously treated disease setting is to achieve deep durable remissions 
with prolonged PFS in order to prevent disease related complications, without incurring significant 
treatment related toxicities. Despite recent improvement in treatment options an unmet need remains. 
Rationale for the proposed change: 
In follicular lymphoma (FL), lenalidomide has been shown to restore defective immunological synapse 
formation and increase NK cells and subsets of T cells in the blood. 
In marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), lenalidomide stimulated immune mediated killing with a concomitant 
increase ingranzyme B secretion implicating activation of NK cells.

Page 8/139 
 
  
  
Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the CD20 antigen expressed on the surface of pre-B and 
mature B-lymphocytes. Upon binding to CD20, rituximab mediates B-cell lysis. Possible mechanisms of 
cell lysis include complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and ADCC.  
In FL and MZL, the combination of lenalidomide and rituximab (R2) acts by complementary mechanisms 
including activation of NK and T cells and immune synapse formation resulting in increased ADCC and 
direct tumour apoptosis in vitro. 
The activity demonstrated by R2 in previously treated indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL), 
particularly the CR rates (35% to 41%), compared favourably with single-agent lenalidomide (CR: 9% to 
20%) (Leonard, 2015; Witzig, 2009) and single-agent rituximab (CR: approximately 3% to 20%). 
The proposed indication was applied as follows: 
•  REVLIMID  in  combination  with  rituximab  (anti-CD20  antibody)  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of 
adult patients with previously treated follicular lymphoma or marginal zone lymphoma. 
Following the evaluation of this application the indication was revised as follows: 
Follicular lymphoma 
Revlimid in combination with rituximab (anti-CD20 antibody) is indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients with previously treated follicular lymphoma (Grade 1 – 3a). 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects  
Non-clinical data were previously provided for Lenalidomide regarding pharmacology, pharmacokinetics 
and toxicology. For this application, pharmacology studies were provided to support lenalidomide in 
combination with rituximab (anti-CD20 antibody) for the treatment of adult patients with previously 
treated follicular lymphoma or marginal zone lymphoma. 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Lenalidomide binds directly to cereblon, a component of a cullin ring E3 ubiquitin ligase enzyme complex 
that includes deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage-binding protein 1(DDB1), cullin 4 (CUL4), and 
regulator of cullins 1 (Roc1). In haematopoietic cells, lenalidomide binding to cereblon recruits substrate 
proteins Aiolos and Ikaros, lymphoid transcriptional factors, leading to their ubiquitination and 
subsequent degradation resulting in direct cytotoxic and immunomodulatory effects. 
Specifically, lenalidomide inhibits proliferation and enhances apoptosis of certain haematopoietic tumour 
cells (including MM plasma tumour cells, follicular lymphoma tumour cells and those with deletions of 
chromosome 5), enhances T cell- and Natural Killer (NK) cell-mediated immunity and increases the 
number of NK, T and NK T cells. In MDS Del (5q), lenalidomide selectively inhibits the abnormal clone by 
increasing the apoptosis of Del (5q) cells. 
The combination of lenalidomide and rituximab increases ADCC and direct tumor apoptosis in follicular 
lymphoma cells. 
The lenalidomide mechanism of action also includes additional activities such as anti-angiogenic and pro-
erythropoietic properties. Lenalidomide inhibits angiogenesis by blocking the migration and adhesion of 
endothelial cells and the formation of microvessels, augments foetal haemoglobin production by CD34+ 
haematopoietic stem cells, and inhibits production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α and IL-6) 
by monocytes. 
An embryofoetal development study has been conducted in monkeys administered lenalidomide at doses 
from 0.5 and up to 4 mg/kg/day. Findings from this study indicate that lenalidomide produced external 
malformations including non-patent anus and malformations of upper and lower extremities (bent, 
shortened, malformed, malrotated and/or absent part of the extremities, oligo and/or polydactyly) in the 
offspring of female monkeys who received the active substance during pregnancy.

Various visceral effects (discoloration, red foci at different organs, small colourless mass above atrio-
ventricular valve, small gall bladder, malformed diaphragm) were also observed in single foetuses. 
Lenalidomide has a potential for acute toxicity; minimum lethal doses after oral administration were 
> 2000 mg/kg/day in rodents. Repeated oral administration of 75, 150 and 300 mg/kg/day to rats for up 
to 26 weeks produced a reversible treatment-related increase in kidney pelvis mineralisation in all 
3 doses, most notably in females. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was considered to be 
less than 75 mg/kg/day, and is approximately 25-fold greater than the human daily exposure based on 
AUC exposure. Repeated oral administration of 4 and 6 mg/kg/day to monkeys for up to 20 weeks 
produced mortality and significant toxicity (marked weight loss, reduced red and white blood cell and 
platelet counts, multiple organ haemorrhage, gastrointestinal tract inflammation, lymphoid, and bone 
marrow atrophy). Repeated oral administration of 1 and 2 mg/kg/day to monkeys for up to 1 year 
produced reversible changes in bone marrow cellularity, a slight decrease in myeloid/erythroid cell ratio 
and thymic atrophy. Mild suppression of white blood cell count was observed at 1 mg/kg/day 
corresponding to approximately the same human dose based on AUC comparisons. 
In vitro (bacterial mutation, human lymphocytes, mouse lymphoma, Syrian Hamster Embryo cell 
transformation) and in vivo (rat micronucleus) mutagenicity studies revealed no drug related effects at 
either the gene or chromosomal level. Carcinogenicity studies with lenalidomide have not been 
conducted. 
Developmental toxicity studies were previously conducted in rabbits. In these studies, rabbits were 
administered 3, 10 and 20 mg/kg/day orally. An absence of the intermediate lobe of the lung was 
observed at 10 and 20 mg/kg/day with dose dependence and displaced kidneys were observed at 
20 mg/kg/day. Although it was observed at maternotoxic levels they may be attributable to a direct 
effect. Soft tissue and skeletal variations in the foetuses were also observed at 10 and 20 mg/kg/day.

pediatric patients with 
DLBCL. 
Lenalidomide did not increase apoptosis in U698M or 
U2940 cells. 
Lenalidomide demonstrates anti-proliferative activity in 
1/3 juvenile DLBCL cell lines. No apoptotic activity by 
lenalidomide was observed in any cell line tested. The 
immune mediated effects of lenalidomide against 
pediatric DLBCL cell lines were not examined. 
Lenalidomide displayed dose-dependent 
antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic activity in the 
human SMZL model. 
Lenalidomide also induced anti-CD3 stimulated PBMCs 
to kill SMZL cells in a dose-dependent manner that 
correlated with Granzyme B release. 
In combination with Rtx, lenalidomide displays an 
additive, effect on proliferation, apoptosis, and PBMC 
mediated killing of SMZL cells when compared to 
single agent activity alone. 
Lenalidomide enhanced proliferation and activation of 
T, NK, and NK T subsets in FL PBMCs in a   
concentration-dependent manner. 
Lenalidomide did not negatively affect PBMC viability. 
The R2 combination (lenalidomide + rituximab) 
enhanced FL patient PBMC mediated antibody-
dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against 
parental and chemoresistant FL cell lines. 
The R2 combination was more potent at inducing 
PBMC-mediated ADCC than Rtx combined with 
chemotherapeutic/novel agents tested. 
The R2 combination additively or synergistically 
enhanced the autonomous cytotoxicity in FL cell lines 
as compared to the combination of Rtx with other 
chemotherapeutic/novel agents. 
The R2 combination enhances MZL patient PBMC 
mediated ADCC against MZL cell line. Lenalidomide 
enhanced autonomous cytotoxicity in the MZL cell line.

The Hut102 cell line exhibited highly sensitive behavior 
to lenalidomide, i.e., cell viability decreased to less 
than 
20% at 1 μM lenalidomide. The mRNA expression 
levels of cereblon was highest in the HuT102 cell line 
compared with other ATL cell lines, and low for the 
expression of Ikaros family zinc finger 1 (IKZF1) to 
IKZF3.

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Effects of lenalidomide (10 μM, during 19 days or 12 days with 7 days washout) on neutrophil maturation 
were evaluated using flow cytometry starting with bone marrow CD34+ cells from healthy volunteers. 
Cell numbers, differentiation, and apoptosis were measured twice a week during the experiment. Results 
showed that late-stage neutrophil maturation was blocked by lenalidomide, whereas cell viability was not 
affected. In case of wash out period during the experiment, 50% recovery of normal maturation was 
observed following the 3-day washout period, and control values were reached after one week. 
2.2.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Additional pharmacokinetic studies were not submitted. 
2.2.4.  Toxicology  
Additional toxicology studies were not submitted. 
2.2.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) for the Follicular Lymphoma (FL) and Marginal Zone 
Lymphoma (MZL) indication requested in this variation dossier was addressed in the updated ERA 
submitted recently with the EMA/H/C/000717/II/102G procedure. Based on the performed Phase I ERA, 
the intended medicinal use of lenalidomide are considered to be of negligible risk to the environment. As 
the updated ERA covering FL and MZL indications has already been submitted through the procedure 
II/102G, the ERA is not provided as part of this submission. 
2.2.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Complementary pharmacologic studies were provided for lenalidomide to support the proposed indication 
(Lenalidomide in combination with rituximab in FL and MZL) in different cell lines in vitro and in ATL in 
vivo.  
Several in vitro studies were provided on mantle cell lymphoma cell lines, DLBCL, marginal zone 
lymphoma, follicular lymphoma and adult T-Cell Lymphoma/Leukaemia with lenalidomide as single agent 
or in combination with Rituximab. Lenalidomide exerts anti-tumour activity against MCL cell lines mainly 
through a modulation of NK cell–mediated cytotoxicity and is active against MCL cell lines resistant to 
ibrutinib. In paediatric DLBCL, lenalidomide demonstrates anti-proliferative activity in some (not all, 1/3) 
juvenile DLBCL cell lines with no associated apoptotic activity in any cell line tested. Concerning human 
SMZL model, lenalidomide displayed dose-dependent anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activity. In 
combination with Rituximab, effects on proliferation, apoptosis, and PBMC mediated killing of SMZL cells 
were additive. Lenalidomide expands and activates effector T, NK, and NKT subsets and increases 
cytokine production in both healthy and FL patient PBMC ex vivo and the combination with Rituximab 
demonstrated an enhanced effect on immune-mediated and direct cytotoxicity against FL and MZL cell 
lines. The growth inhibitory effects of lenalidomide was examined on 13 ATL related cell lines and 5 non-
ATL type T-cell lymphoma, most of ATL or non-ATL cell lines showed no or very poor responses to 
lenalidomide treatment. 
The effects of lenalidomide, as a single agent or in combination with rituximab demonstrated direct 
antiproliferative activity and apoptosis induction that was enhanced with the drug combination. The data 
provided support the proposed indication by demonstrating activity of the Lenalidomide Rituximab 
combination in NHL in vitro with FL and MZL patient cells. Moreover Lenalidomide was demonstrated to 
suppress the growth of adult T-cell lymphoma/leukaemia (ATL) on xenografted severe combined 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/693880/2019 
Page 13/139 
 
  
  
 
immunodeficient (SCID) mouse model.  
Furthermore, lenalidomide was found to be effective when administration was started after the growth of 
HUT102 cells. Cell viability and proliferation of CD34+ derived cells on myeloid cultures exposed to 
lenalidomide 10 μM was not affected under all treatment conditions. Washout for at least two days favors 
cell maturation, but it was not enough to recover a normal differentiation rate in vitro. Up to five or seven 
days were needed to recover control values. 
2.2.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The data provided demonstrate an anti-tumour activity in B-cell lymphomas, of which SMZL and FL are 
subtypes and supports the development of Lenalidomide and Rituximab as a therapeutic in the treatment 
of SMZL and FL.

2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
In Pivotal study AUGMENT (CC-5013-NHL-007) the starting dose of lenalidomide is 20 mg administered 
daily for 21 consecutive days in each 28-day cycle for up to 12 cycles.  
Table 4 Activity of lenalidomide in combination with rituximab in Phase 2 trials that enrolled previously 
treated Follicular Lymphoma patients 
In the randomized Phase 2 Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 50401 trial (previously treated FL n = 
46), the administration of 12 cycles of R2 (lenalidomide in Cycles 1 to 12 and rituximab given in 4 weekly 
infusions in Cycle 1) versus lenalidomide monotherapy resulted in high response rates (ORR = 76% and 
CR = 39%) (Leonard, 2015).  
The number of cycles for R2 in AUGMENT was calculated based on lenalidomide schedule (i.e., up to 12 
cycles of lenalidomide). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/693880/2019

In previously treated FL/MZL the proposed duration of R2 treatment is 12 cycles (lenalidomide:Cycles 1 to 
12; rituximab: 4 weekly infusions in Cycle 1, and Day 1 of Cycles 2 to 5 for a total of 8 doses) as studied 
in AUGMENT. The choice of 12 cycles of R2 in previously treated FL/MZL is supported by the published 
studies in relapsed or refractory FL/MZL (Table above).

Treatments 
Eligible subjects entering the Treatment Phase were randomized in a 1:1 ratio using an interactive voice 
response system (IVRS) into one of the 2 arms (experimental or control). 
• 
Experimental Arm (R2): 
o  Rituximab 375 mg/m2 every week in Cycle 1 (Days 1, 8, 15, 22) and on Day 1 of every 28-
day Cycle from Cycles 2 through 5 
plus 
o 
Lenalidomide once daily on Days 1 to 21 of every 28-day Cycle up to 12 cycles 
•  Control Arm: 
o  Rituximab 375 mg/m2 every week in Cycle 1 (Days 1, 8, 15, 22) and on Day 1 of every 28-
day Cycle from Cycles 2 through 5 
plus 
o  Placebo (identical matched capsule) once daily on Days 1 to 21 of every 28-day Cycle up 
to 12 cycles 
Co-administration (i.e., lenalidomide intake during the rituximab infusion) was to be avoided. Due to the 
duration of the rituximab infusion and potential infusion-related reactions to rituximab, administration of 
lenalidomide before rituximab was to be considered. 
Celgene supplied lenalidomide 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 20 mg capsules and the respective 
matching placebo capsules for oral administration. 
Objectives 
Primary 
Assessment report

• 
To  compare  the  efficacy  of  lenalidomide  in  combination  with  rituximab  (R2)  to  rituximab  plus 
placebo in subjects with relapsed/refractory indolent lymphoma. Efficacy determination was based 
upon  progression-free  survival  (PFS)  as  the  primary  endpoint,  as  assessed  by  the  Independent 
Review Committee (IRC) using the 2007 International Working Group Response Criteria (IWGRC) 
without positron emission tomography (PET). 
Secondary 
• 
• 
To compare the safety of R2 versus rituximab plus placebo 
To compare the efficacy of R2 versus rituximab plus placebo using other parameters of efficacy: 
o  Durable complete response rate (DCRR), overall response rate (ORR), complete response 
(CR) rate, duration of response(DOR), and duration of complete response (DOCR) by the 
2007IWGRC without PET 
o  Overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), and time to next anti-lymphoma treatment 
(TTNLT) 
Exploratory 
• 
To compare the effects of R2 versus rituximab plus placebo on: 
o  TTF,  time  to  next  chemotherapy  treatment  (TTNCT),  and  response  rate  to  next  anti-
lymphoma treatment (RTNLT) 
o  CR/CRu rate in subjects with FL based on the 1999 IWGRC (Cheson, 1999) 
o  PFS on next anti-lymphoma treatment (PFS 2) 
o 
time to histological transformation 
•  Health-related quality of life (QOL) as measured by the European Organisation for Research and 
Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30(QLQ-C30) and Euro-Qol Group's 
questionnaire 5 dimensions (EQ-5D) 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint: 
Progression Free Survival defined as the time from date of randomization into the study to the first 
observation of documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first.  
Secondary/exploratory endpoints: 
ORR, CR rate, DOCR, DOR, OS, EFS, TTNLT, TTNCT, PFS2, time to histological transformation. 
Sample size 
To fulfil the primary objective of the study, it had to be shown that the experimental arm was superior to 
the control arm on the primary endpoint at one-sided α-level of 0.025. It was hypothesized that the 
median PFS was 17.6 months in the experimental arm and 11 months in the control arm (corresponding 
HR of 0.625, assuming that FL and MZL subjects had the same median PFS). For 90% power to detect 
this difference with one-sided α-level of 0.025, a total of 193 PFS events was required. 
Based on the rate of accrual anticipated in this study and annual dropout rate of 5%, it was planned to 
randomize a total of approximately 350 subjects in a 1:1 ratio to the 2 treatment arms and the time to 
reach the PFS events was expected to be 43 months. 
Randomisation 
The randomization is stratified as follows: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/693880/2019 
Page 19/139 
 
  
  
• 
• 
• 
previous rituximab treatment (yes, no) 
time since last anti-lymphoma therapy (≤ 2, > 2 years), 
disease histology (FL, MZL) 
Blinding (masking) 
For this trial, study subjects, investigators, staff, and Celgene clinical and medical representatives were 
all blinded to the treatment assignments. Both lenalidomide and placebo capsules were identical in 
appearance. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis population 
ITT population: all subjects who were randomized into the trial, regardless of whether they received study 
treatment or not.  
The ITT Population was used for the primary efficacy analysis. Subjects were analysed according to the 
treatment arm to which they were initially assigned. 
mITT  population:  all  randomized  subjects  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  study  medication,  had  a 
confirmed diagnosis of relapsed/refractory FL or MZL by central pathology review, except SMZL which was 
based on local pathology assessment, and had baseline (Screening) and at least one post-baseline tumour 
assessment for efficacy. 
The efficacy analysis was also performed on the mITT Population as supportive evidence and/or 
sensitivity analysis. Subjects were analyzed according to the treatment arm to which they were initially 
assigned. 
Safety population: all subjects who received at least one dose of study medication.  
The Safety Population was used for all safety analyses. Subjects were analyzed according to the 
treatment which they actually received. 
In addition to analyses that include the ITT Population, certain efficacy analyses were performed for 
subgroups to compare treatments within stratification factors:  previous rituximab treatment (yes, no), 
time since last anti-lymphoma therapy (≤ 2, > 2 years), and histology (FL, MZL). 
Time  to  event  endpoints:  Kaplan-Meier  (KM)  survival  analyses  were  performed  (unadjusted  for  the 
stratification  variables)  for  time-to-event  data.  The  number  and  percent  of  subjects  censored  were 
provided. Kaplan-Meier product limit method was used to estimate the survivorship function for all time-
to-event endpoints (e.g., PFS, OS, EFS). Event rates at specific time points were estimated from KM curves. 
Medians together with two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs), plus standard deviation (StD), minimum, 
and maximum were provided. The CI was constructed using log-log transformation. 
The resulting survival estimates were presented graphically for selected endpoints. 
Subjects were stratified according to previous rituximab treatment, time since last anti-lymphoma 
therapy, and histology. The stratified Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to estimate 
the hazard ratios (HRs) and associated 95% CIs for the HRs. 
Categorical endpoints: The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test with the stratification factors as strata was 
used for categorical data. The p-values were presented. The probability of rates was estimated using the 
proportion of subjects with responses with exact two-sided 95% CIs. 
Quality of life endpoints: The analyses of the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the EQ-5D were based on all randomized 
subjects who completed the baseline assessment (at Screening) and had at least one follow-up assessment 
with the EORTC QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D, respectively. The observed case method and the describable statistics 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/693880/2019 
Page 20/139 
 
  
  
were used to summarize the observed scores and the change from baseline score by visit and the treatment 
group for each domain of the QOL assessments. 
Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) was assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 (Version 3) and the EQ-
5D-3L (3 level version) questionnaire at Screening (i.e., baseline), after every 3 cycles during treatment 
(i.e., Day 1 Cycle 4; Day 1 Cycle 7; Day1 Cycle 10), and at the end of treatment, regardless of the 
causes. The assessments were completed every 6 months until PD after completion of treatment or 
discontinuation of treatment for reasons other than PD or relapse. 
Analyses of the HRQOL data was detailed in a separate SAP for evaluating patient-reported outcomes in 
AUGMENT. The objective of the HRQOL analyses was to assess the effect of lenalidomide in combination 
with rituximab (the R2 Arm) versus rituximab plus placebo (the Control Arm) on HRQOL over time. The 
global health status/QOL of the EORTC QLQ-C30 was the pre-specified primary domain of interest. The 
remaining domains and the EQ-5D health utility and visual analog scale (VAS) were assessed as 
exploratory outcomes. 
Missing data 
For the analysis of PFS, missing assessments or discontinuations due to reasons other than PD were 
handled by the censoring rules. 
Table 5 Censoring rules used for the Primary analysis of PFS 
In addition, various sensitivity analyses were performed to explore different ways of censoring to confirm 
the robustness of the planned primary analysis.

Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
o  Protocol Amendment 1 (dated 17 Jul 2013) 
Amendment 1 changed the criteria to assess response from the 1999 IWGRC to the 2007 IWGRC (without 
PET). The change enabled the inclusion and appropriate assessments of FL and MZL subjects in the study, 
as these 2007 IWGRC for malignant lymphoma allowed the inclusion of extranodal disease as measurable 
disease. Overall, 30 subjects were enrolled under Amendment 1 of the protocol. 
o  Protocol Amendment 2 (dated 22 May 2014) 
-  Amended Exclusion Criteria to exclude severe infections ; Amended Inclusion Criteria to ensure that 
the female study subjects to be also informed about the pregnancy prevention guidelines provided in 
the Rituximab/Mabthera SmPC (as long as the infertility was not definitely confirmed); Revised the 
CT/MRI scan timing requirement after Year 5 to one per year. Amendment of Inclusion Criterion thus 
allowing subjects with only extranodal lesions to be eligible. Amended Exclusion Criterion allowing 
subjects with a history of HCV, and who received antiviral treatment and who had no detectable HCV 
RNA levels for at least 12 months. Amended Inclusion Criterion to require BMB at Screening only in 
case of abnormal blood counts (and not in all cases). Bone marrow biopsies were needed to confirm a 
CR and, since a large proportion of subjects were not anticipated to achieve a CR, limiting the BMB at 
Screening was to spare many subjects an invasive procedure. 
-  Revised the exclusionary time period from ≥ 10 to ≥ 5 years for prior malignancies and addition of 
precision on the exceptions of localized non-melanoma skin cancer. Basal cell carcinoma of the skin 
and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin were additional exceptions.   
-  Clarified management of subjects at risk for HBV reactivation; Clarified study treatment continuation 
rules in case of lenalidomide or rituximab intolerance/hypersensitivity. 
Overall, 245 subjects were enrolled under Amendment 2 of the protocol. 
o  Protocol Amendment 3 (dated 21 Oct 2015) 
Amendment 3 modified Inclusion Criterion 4 to no longer allow rituximab-naïve subjects in the study; to 
confirm that subjects had to have documented relapsed, refractory, or PD after treatment with systemic 
therapy, and must not be rituximab-refractory; defined refractory lymphoma as a subject who received a 
non-rituximab containing systemic therapy and who experienced the best response of PD to this therapy 
was considered to have refractory lymphoma. This amendment revised exclusion Criteria for HCV positive 
subjects who did not have an active hepatitis C infection and who were otherwise acceptable candidates 
for this study.  The requirement for a diagnosis of SMZL for subjects who did not have a spleen specimen 
available during the Screening Period was defined. It was also clarified that all subjects had to receive 
tumour lysis prophylaxis. 
Overall, 83 subjects were enrolled under Amendment 3 of the protocol.

Changes from final protocol to Final SAP: Due to the small number of histology transformations, exploratory 
endpoint time to histology transformation was changed to histology transformation rate. No changes were 
made to the final SAP before the study was un-blinded. 
Changes  to  final  statistical  analysis  plan  after  study  unblinding:  For  FL/MZL  subpopulation  analyses, 
stratified analyses were replaced by un-stratified analyses to be consistent with subgroup analyses. 
For DOR and DOCR, un-stratified analyses were conducted due to the small number of complete 
responses in the Control Arm. 
Protocol deviations 
Protocol deviations were defined as any unplanned diversions from the approved protocol. 
Protocol violations were defined as any departures from the approved protocol that impacted the safety, 
rights, and/or welfare of the subject, negatively impacted the quality or completeness of the data, or 
made the informed consent process inaccurate. 
A total of 326 subjects (166 subjects [93.3%] in the R2 Arm and 160 subjects [88.9%] in the Control 
Arm) had at least one protocol deviation.

Outcomes and estimation 
The ITT Population was used for the primary efficacy analysis. The primary efficacy analyses were based 
on data from the IRC review, using the modified 2007 IWGRC. Data from the investigator’s assessments 
were used in a supportive analysis for the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints.

Previously treated FL 
For the primary endpoint PFS, when applying EMA censoring rules, there was a 60% reduction in the risk 
of progression or death for the R2 Arm compared to the Control Arm (HR = 0.40; 95% CI: 0.29, 0.55; p < 
0.0001).

Previously treated MZL 
The PFS results in subjects with MZL were inconsistent with that of the overall population. In the MZL 
subgroup, PFS results were numerically similar between the R2 Arm and the Control Arm with an 
unstratified HR of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.41, 1.83) (EMA censoring rules). Univariate and multivariate analyses 
suggested that the PFS results in the MZL subgroup were likely explained by the small sample size and 
the imbalance in baseline prognostic factors (e.g., age, Ann Arbor Stage, FLIPI score, ECOG performance 
status score, B symptoms, and LDH) in favour of the Control Arm. Adjusting for the imbalance between 
arms in identified, statistically significant prognostic factors (Ann Arbor Stage and LDH) in the MZL 
subgroup resulted in a PFS HR of 0.460 (95% CI: 0.192, 1.101) in favour of the R2 Arm; this HR was 
similar to in the overall ITT Population. 
Univariate and multivariate analysis of PFS 
Univariate analyses using Cox regression model revealed that several baseline factors were prognostic in 
the MZL subgroup. Specifically, Ann Arbor Stage IV, elevated LDH, and “unfit for chemotherapy” were 
identified as significant prognostic factors based on significance level of p < 0.05. 
Multivariate analyses adjusting for the imbalance in these 3 significant prognostic factors in the MZL 
subgroup showed an adjusted PFS HR of 0.51 (95% CI: 0.20, 1.28) in favour of the R2 Arm;

Duration of Complete Response (DOCR) 
Overall, the median DOCR (95% CI) by IRC assessment per the 2007 IWGRC among responders was not 
estimable in either treatment arm. In the R2 Arm, the probability of DOCR (95% CI) at ≥ 12 months was 
84.2% (71.8%, 91.5%) versus 77.0% (57.6%, 88.3%) in the Control Arm. In the R2 Arm, the probability 
of DOCR (95% CI) at ≥ 24 months was 67.4% (50.8%, 79.5%) versus 61.7% (41.2%, 76.8%) in the 
Control Arm. Similar results were shown in subjects with FL. 
In subjects with MZL, the median DOCR (95% CI) by IRC assessment per the 2007 IWGRC among 
responders was 22.1 months in the R2 Arm and not estimable in the Control Arm. In the R2 Arm, the 
probability of DOCR (95% CI) at ≥ 12 months was 88.9% (43.3%, 98.4%) versus 100.0% (100.0%, 
100.0%) in the Control Arm. In the R2 Arm, the probability of DOCR (95% CI) at ≥ 24 months was 
44.4% (1.0%, 86.6%) versus 100.0% (100.0%, 100.0%) in the Control Arm. 
Durable Complete Response Rate (DCRR) 
Overall, 45 subjects (25.3%) in the R2 Arm and 20 subjects (11.1%) in the Control Arm had a DCRR (p = 
0.0006). Furthermore, of the subjects with ongoing CR, 6 subjects (10.0%) in theR2 Arm and 3 subjects 
(9.1%) in the Control Arm achieved CR for < 1 year. Of subjects who had CR but were no longer in CR, 9 
subjects (15.0%) in the R2 Arm and 10 subjects (30.3%) in the Control Arm achieved CR for < 1 year. 
Similar results were noted in subjects with FL. 
A similar trend was observed in subjects with MZL: DCRR was achieved by 7 subjects (22.6%)in the R2 
Arm versus 2 subjects (6.3%) in the Control Arm (p = 0.0816).  
Overall survival (OS) 
With a median follow up of 28.30 months, there were 16 deaths in the R2 Arm versus 26 deaths in the 
Control Arm reported (HR [95% CI]: 0.61 [0.33, 1.13]); the medians OS for both arms have not been 
reached, see table below. Kaplan-Meier curves overlapped until 1 year with separation shown after 1 
year, see figure below.

The EFS HR (95% CI) was 0.51 (0.38, 0.67); p-value < 0.0001. The EFS rate (95% CI) as assessed by 
the IRC at one year was 80.5% (73.7%, 85.7%) for the R2 Arm and 56.2% (48.6%, 63.1%) for the 
Control Arm. Similar results were seen in subjects with FL. 
In subjects with MZL, the median EFS (95% CI) was 20.2 months (14.5, NE) in the R2 Arm and 25.1 
months (9.2, NE) in the Control Arm. The EFS HR (95% CI) was 1.18 (0.60, 2.29); p-value = 0.6324. 
The EFS rate (95% CI) as assessed by the IRC at 1 year was 75.5% (55.2%, 85.7%) for the R2 Arm and 
65.6% (46.6%, 79.3%) for the Control Arm.

Best Response by IRC Assessment per 1999 IWGRC – ITT Population 
Results by IRC assessment per the 1999 IWGRC criteria (overall and in subjects with FL and subjects with 
MZL) were consistent with the results using the 2007 IWGRC criteria. The response rates were very 
similar to the 2007 IWGRC results, but differences were noted due to combined CR/CRu.

PFS2 
Progression-free survival on next antilymphoma treatment (PFS2) was defined as time from 
randomization to the first observation of disease progression or death due to any cause after next 
antilymphoma treatment, or start of a third antilymphoma treatment since randomization in the study, 
whichever occurs first. 
In the ITT Population, PFS2 was improved in the R2 Arm compared with the Control Arm with an HR 
(95% CI) of 0.52 (0.32, 0.82); p = 0.0046. Median PFS2was not estimable. Similar results were seen in 
subjects with FL. 
In subjects with MZL, the PFS2 HR (95% CI) was 1.02 (0.39, 2.65); p = 0.9643.

Evaluation of Quality of life 
Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) were measured by the European Organisation for Research and 
Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30) and EuroQol Group's 
questionnaire 5 dimensions (EQ-5D). 
A minimal important difference (MID) of a ≥ 10-point change from baseline at the individual subject level 
was used to define the proportion of subjects reporting a meaningful difference in QOL for any given 
domain of the EORTC QLQ-C30 (Osoba, 1998). For the EQ-5D health utility, the MID was defined as a 
change from baseline of ≥ 0.08 for improvement and ≥ 0.10 for deterioration (Kvam, 2011). For the EQ-
5D VAS, a MID of 7 was used (Pickard, 2007). 
The HRQOL compliance rates, based on the number of expected subjects at a given visit as the 
denominator, were ≥ 89% across all assessment visits during the treatment phase, regardless of 
treatment group 
Table 25 Compliance quotient EORCT-C30 global health status questionnaire – ITT population 
Note: A subject is considered compliant at a visit if the Global Health Status/QoL domain of the QLQ-C30 is not 
missing. The denominator is estimated based on the number of subjects who are alive and eligible for assessment at a 
given time point.  
[a]: The p-values are calculated based on the Fisher exact test comparing Rituximab + Lenalidomide vs. Rituximab + 
Placebo.  
The primary HRQOL analyses were performed based on the HRQOL-evaluable population, which included 
subjects in the ITT Population who had a global health status/QOL domain score at the Screening (ie, 
baseline) visit and at least 1 post baseline assessment. Of the ITT Population (n = 358), 94.4% (n = 338) 
met the inclusion criteria for the HRQOL-evaluable population at Screening (165 [92.7%] subjects in the 
R2 Arm and 173 [96.1%] subjects in the Control Arm).

Table  26  Summary  of  EORTC  QLQ-C30  scale  (global  health  status)  and  change  from  baseline  –  ITT 
population 
At a group level, there was no change from baseline through the end of treatment exceeding the 
threshold of MID in the global health status/QOL domain of the EORTC QLQ-C30, regardless of treatment 
group. 
Table 27 Summary of change from baseline in HRQOL by visit (global QOL) – HRQOL-evaluable population 
Note: “HRQoL evaluable population” are subjects with an evaluable QLQ-C30 questionnaire at screening visit and at least one post-
baseline visit. A QLQ-C30 is considered evaluable if the Global Health Status/QoL scale of the QLQ-C30 is not missing. FU = follow-up.  
The “*” sign will be used to indicate a significant difference (p < 0.05) in the change from baseline between treatment groups at a given 
assessment visit based on ANCOVA tests 
Comparison of the proportion of subjects in each treatment group who experienced a clinically meaningful 
worsening across each post baseline visit showed that there was no significant difference in the worsening 
of the global health status/QOL domain between treatment groups across all post baseline assessment 
visits, except for the Cycle 4 Day 1 visit, when the R2 Arm showed a significant greater percentage of 
worsening (p = 0.049). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/693880/2019 
Page 50/139 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
The difference in the time to first clinically meaningful worsening in the global health status/QOL domain 
between treatment groups was not statistically significant (HR = 1.22; p = 0.1594). 
Table 28 Summary of Time to First Clinically Meaningful Deterioration (HRQoL Evaluable Population) 
There were, however, a few domains where the R2 Arm had a significantly greater percentage of 
worsening than the Control Arm for at least 2 consecutive assessment visits during the treatment period, 
including fatigue, appetite loss, constipation, and diarrhoea.

Supportive study 
  MAGNIFY (Study CC-5013-NHL-008) 
This is a multicenter, 2-part Phase 3b study with an open-label, single-arm Initial Treatment Period with 
R2 followed by a 2-arm, randomized Extended Treatment Period in subjects with previously treated FL 
Grades 1 to 3b, tFL, MZL, or MCL. The study design is presented below.

Figure 10 Overall study design of MAGNIFY 
This study is ongoing, and enrolment is ongoing (295 subjects enrolled as of 01 May 2017). The interim 
clinical study report submitted for this study presents safety and efficacy data from the Initial Treatment 
Period only based on a data cut-off date of 01 May 2017. 
Eligible subjects were 18 years or older with histologically confirmed FL Grade 1, 2, or 3; tFL; MZL; or 
MCL and were previously treated with at least one prior lymphoma treatment and have documented 
relapsed, refractory, or progressive disease (PD) (subjects could be refractory or non-refractory to 
rituximab). Following the Screening Period, all eligible subjects entered a 12-cycle Initial Treatment 
Period during which they received 12 cycles of R2. 
The primary endpoint for the final analysis is PFS of the extended treatment period post-randomization 
whereas the primary efficacy endpoint for the interim analysis is ORR of the Initial Treatment Period, 
defined as proportion of subjects with a best overall response of at least PR (including CR, CRu and PR) 
before any Extended Treatment Period treatment and prior to any subsequent anti-lymphoma therapy 
using 1999 IWGRC with a modification to allow inclusion of extranodal disease as measurable disease. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints include CR (CR and CRu) rate, DOR, DOCR, TTR, and ORR. Transformation 
and PFS are exploratory efficacy endpoints. 
The analysis population is defined as follows: 
Induction intent-to-treat (IITT) population:  all enrolled subjects with FL Grade 1 to 3a or MZL who 
met all the eligibility criteria for the study. 
Induction efficacy evaluable (IEE) population: all subjects in the IITT population who have received 
at least 1 dose of initial therapy, who have baseline and at least one post-baseline efficacy assessment, 
including subjects who died or progressed before first on-study assessment. The IEE population will be 
used as the primary analysis population to evaluate the response rate of the initial treatment period. 
Induction Safety Population: subjects with FL Grade 1 to 3a or MZL who had received at least 1 dose 
of initial therapy, either lenalidomide or rituximab. Safety analyses of the Induction Period are based on 
the induction safety population.

Second primary malignancy (SPM) safety population: all subjects with FL Grade 1 to 3b, tFL, MZL 
and MCL who have received at least 1 dose of initial therapy, either lenalidomide or rituximab. SPM safety 
population will be used for the SPM analyses. 
The number of subjects in each analysis population is summarized below.

Study NHL-001 
Study NHL-001 was a Phase 2, multicenter, single-arm, open-label study of lenalidomide monotherapy in 
subjects with relapsed or refractory indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL). 
Subjects entered the treatment phase and received single-agent lenalidomide 25 mg QD on Days 1 to 21 
of every 28-day cycle. Subjects continued in the treatment phase for up to 52 weeks or until disease 
progression developed or lenalidomide treatment was discontinued for any reason. All subjects who 
discontinued the treatment phase for any reason as well as all subjects who completed the treatment 
phase were followed until disease progression or until the next lymphoma treatment was given, 
whichever came first. A subject who achieved a CR at any time during the 52-week treatment period 
received 2 additional cycles of treatment prior to discontinuing the treatment phase and entering the 
follow-up phase.

Data from the RELEVANCE STUDY 
RELEVANCE is an ongoing, phase 3, randomized, active-controlled, open-label study of R2for eighteen 4 
week cycles followed by rituximab monotherapy for another six 8-week cycles (total duration of ~30 
months) versus R- CHEMO for 6 to 8 cycles followed by rituximab for up to twelve 8-week cycles (total 
duration of 30 months), subjects with previously untreated FL (Grades 1 to 3a) requiring systemic 
treatment according to “Groupe d’Etude des Lymphomes folliculaires” (GELF) criteria. Second primary 
malignancy data and analyses presented for the RELEVANCE study are based on the safety population 
defined as all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study medication.  
A total of 1010 subjects received at least 1 dose of study medication with either R2 (507subjects) or R- 
CHEMO (503subjects). In the R-CHEMO Arm, 365 subjects received R-CHOP, 26 subjects received R-CVP, 
and 112subjects received R-Benda. The overall median follow- up time for surviving subjects in the safety 
population was 39.1months (range: 0.9 to 61.3months) as of the data cutoff date of 31May2017

Findings from this study with regards to second primary malignancies are discussed under Clinical Safety. 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Integrated efficacy analysis was done by pooling subjects in the R2 Arm from the AUGMENT study 
together with the R2 Initial Treatment Period from the MAGNIFY study to increase the sample size of data 
in subgroups. Efficacy data were analyzed based on response (eg, ORR, CR, DOR) and PFS (median PFS, 
1-year PFS rate) for the entire pooled data set and by histology (ie, FL and MZL). Subpopulation analyses 
were performed for the Full Analysis Set (FAS) and FL FAS populations. In addition, efficacy analyses 
were performed by MZL subtype (MALT, SMZL, and NMZL). 
The inclusion of data from the Initial Treatment Period of the MAGNIFY study was based on the following 
considerations: 
-  MAGNIFY enrolled previously treated FL and MZL patients regardless of rituximab refractory status, 
which allows assessment of efficacy for R2 in broader subgroups of subjects with previously treated 
Fl or MZL. 
-  Dose and schedule of R2 in MAGNIFY Initial Treatment Period are similar to those of AUGMENT. The 
subtle difference in the schedule of rituximab between AUGMENT (4 weekly infusions followed by 4 
additional doses on Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3, 4, and 5) and MAGNIFY (4 weekly infusions of rituximab 
followed by 5 additional doses on Day 1 of Cycles 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11) is not expected to have a 
meaningful impact on therapeutic benefit of R2 based on a number of considerations. The widely 
accepted standard dosing schedule of rituximab in previously treated iNHL is 4 weekly infusions of 
rituximab,  which  is  identical  between  AUGMENT  and  MAGNIFY.  The  totality  of  published  studies 
showed  that  extended  dosing  (i.e.,  additional  doses  of  rituximab  beyond  standard  4  weekly 
infusions) further improves benefit in a manner that is independent of the number or schedule of 
extended rituximab dosing (i.e., 4 or more doses; every 1, 2, 3, or 6 months) (Hainsworth, 2002; 
Ardeshna, 2014; Taverna, 2016; Ghielmini, 2004; Coiffier, 2011). 
-  Objective response rate as assessed per 1999 IWGRC, an established efficacy endpoint for indolent 
lymphoma, is used in both AUGMENT and MAGNIFY to assess the antitumour activity of R2.

The following populations were analyzed: 
- 
Full Analysis Set: includes all enrolled subjects with FL Grades 1 to 3a or MZL who met all criteria 
for eligibility and had baseline and at least one post-baseline efficacy assessment from the MAGNIFY 
study (ie, induction efficacy evaluable population) and all randomized subjects from the AUGMENT 
study (ie, ITT population). 
-  Safety: includes all enrolled subjects with FL Grades 1 to 3a or MZL who received at least 1 dose 
of  study  medication  (including  placebo)  in  the  AUGMENT  and  MAGNIFY  studies.  The  Safety 
Population was used to assess the treatment duration and other safety data. 
Integrated efficacy data were analyzed in subjects with previously treated FL or MZL for the entire data 
set. Additionally, efficacy data were analyzed by histology: 
- 
Follicular lymphoma (Grades 1 to 3a) histology subgroup: includes all previously treated FL subjects 
(Grades 1 to 3a) from the AUGMENT and MAGNIFY studies analyzed and presented as data from 
the whole population. 
-  Marginal zone lymphoma histology subgroup: includes all previously treated MZL subjects from the 
AUGMENT and MAGNIFY studies analyzed and presented as data from the whole population.

In the pooled R2 data from AUGMENT and MAGNIFY, median treatment duration was 11 months (range: 
0.1 to 15.0 months) for the total safety population. Overall, 48.5% of the pooled subjects received or 
completed all 12 cycles of planned study treatment. The median duration of treatment among subjects 
with FL Safety Population and subjects with MZL safety population was similar to that in the total Safety 
Population (FL and MZL).

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Results are mainly coming from a phase 3, double-blind randomized study designed to compare the 
efficacy and safety of rituximab plus lenalidomide versus rituximab plus placebo in subjects with 
relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma or relapsed/refractory marginal zone lymphoma (AUGMENT). 
Data are also supported by one phase 3b supportive study (MAGNIFY).  
Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive rituximab 375 mg/m2 every week in Cycle 1 and on 
Day 1 of every 28-day cycle from cycles 2 through 5 plus lenalidomide once daily on Days 1 to 21 of 
every 28-day cycle up to 12 cycles (experimental arm R2) or rituximab plus placebo (control arm). 
Efficacy determination was based upon PFS as primary endpoint, assessed by the Independent Review 
Committee (IRC). Secondary/exploratory endpoints were ORR, CR rate, DOCR, DOR, OS, EFS, TTNLT, 
TTNCT, PFS2, and time to histological transformation. 
The overall analysis included 358 patients (178 R2 and 180 R). The Follicular lymphoma population was 
comprised of 295 patients (147 R2 and 148 R), and the MZL population was comprised of 63 patients (31 
R2 and 32 R alone). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In the overall population, PFS by IRC assessment was significantly higher in the experimental arm than in 
the control arm. (HR: 0.45 p<0.0001 95% CI = 0.33, 0.61). Results were comparable to those observed 
for the overall population in the FL subgroup (HR= 0.4; p<0.0001; 95% CI = 0.29, 0.55): When applying 
EMA censoring rules, there was a 60% reduction in the risk of progression or death for the R2 Arm 
compared to the Control Arm. 
Objective response rate by IRC assessment (CR+PR; %) are significantly in favour of the R2 arm in the 
overall population (77.5% 95% CI = 70.7; 83.4 versus 53.3% 95% CI= 45.8; 60.8) p<0.0001). Similar 
trend could be observed in the follicular lymphoma subgroup (80.3 IC95=72.9; 86.4) versus 55.4% IC= 
47.0; 63.6) p<0.0001). 
Overall, the median DOR (95% CI) by IRC assessment per the 2007 IWGRC among responders was 36.6 
months (22.9, not estimable [NE]) in the R2 Arm and 21.7 months (12.8, 27.6) in the Control Arm. 
Similar results were noted in subjects with FL. 
Finally, in subjects with FL, there were 11 deaths in the R2 arm versus 24 deaths in the control arm 
reported (HR [95% CI]: 0.45 [0.22, 0.92]). 
AUGMENT study Efficacy results, although globally in favour of R2 versus R, have to be interpreted with 
serious caution, mostly in the MZL setting: 
Based on the results obtained from the AUGMENT study, the clinical benefit of the Lenalidomide plus 
Rituximab combination is uncertain for MZL patients (PFS HR [95% CI]: 0.87 [0.41, 1.83] p =0.7068). 
This is not only a matter of statistical power but could correspond to an inferior benefit (overall 
population, R2 versus R PFS HR: 0.45 p<0.0001 95% CI = 0.33, 0.61). 
ORR and CR rate were higher in the R2 Arm than in the control arm in subjects with MZL; however, due to 
the small sample size, results were not significant (64.5% 95% CI = 45.4, 80.8 versus 43.8% 95% CI= 
26.4; 63.3) p=0.1313). 
In subjects with MZL, the median DOR (95% CI) by IRC assessment per the 2007 IWGRC among 
responders was 17.4 months (13.2, NE) in the R2 Arm and not estimable in in the Control Arm. 
Overall, the median DOCR (95% CI) by IRC assessment per the 2007 IWGRC among responders was not 
estimable in either treatment arm. In the R2 Arm, the probability of DOCR (95% CI) at ≥ 12 months was 
84.2% (71.8%, 91.5%) versus 77.0% (57.6%, 88.3%) in the control arm. In the R2 Arm, the probability

of DOCR (95% CI) at ≥ 24 months was 67.4% (50.8%, 79.5%) versus 61.7% (41.2%, 76.8%) in the 
control arm. Similar results were shown in subjects with FL. 
In subjects with MZL, the median DOCR (95% CI) by IRC assessment per the 2007 IWGRC among 
responders was 22.1 months in the R2 Arm and not estimable in the control arm. In the R2 arm, the 
probability of DOCR (95% CI) at ≥ 12 months was 88.9% (43.3%, 98.4%) versus 100.0% (100.0%, 
100.0%) in the control arm. In the R2 Arm, the probability of DOCR (95% CI) at ≥ 24 months was 44.4% 
(1.0%, 86.6%) versus 100.0% (100.0%, 100.0%) in the rituximab alone arm. 
Finally, with a median follow up of 28.30 months, there were 16 deaths in the R2 Arm versus 26 deaths in 
the control arm reported (HR [95% CI]: 0.61 [0.33, 1.13]); the medians for both arms have not been 
reached. Kaplan-Meier curves overlapped until 1 year with separation shown after 1 year. The 2-year OS 
rate was 92.6% in the R2 Arm and 87.2% in the control arm.  
In subjects with MZL, there were 5 deaths in the R2 Arm versus 2 deaths in the Control Arm reported (HR 
[95% CI]: 2.89 [0.56, 14.92]); the medians for both arms have not been reached. 
Relapse / refractory indolent lymphoma remains an incurable disease. In previously treated iNHL 
patients, rituximab monotherapy is associated with ORR of approximately 38% to 59%. Over time many 
patients become refractory to Rituximab. 
Association of Lenalidomide to Rituximab versus Rituximab alone improves significantly the median PFS in 
patients with follicular lymphoma disease. ORR, OS and PFS 2 are also improved by adjunction of 
Lenalidomide to Rituximab. However, rituximab monotherapy is indicated for treatment of patients with 
stage III-IV follicular lymphoma who are chemoresistant or are in their second or subsequent relapse 
after chemotherapy. AUGMENT study participants were however patients with mostly Grade 1 and 2 FL 
(more than 70% of the included population).  
In the r/r FL setting, selection of salvage treatment usually depends on efficacy of prior regimens. In 
early relapses (<12–24 months), a non-cross-resistant scheme should be preferred (e.g. bendamustine 
after CHOP or vice versa). Other options, including fludarabine-based, platinum salts based or alkylating 
agents-based regimens, could also be useful. Rituximab should be proposed to patients if the previous 
antibody-containing scheme achieved >6- to 12-month duration of remission.  
R2  treatment  not  only  delays  progression  but  also  improves  overall  response  rate.  However,  in  patients 
with  marginal  zone  Lymphoma,  the  combination  of  Lenalidomide  with  Rituximab  has  no  impact  on  the 
progression free survival and on objectives responses rates. More worrying, there were 5 deaths in the R2 
Arm versus 2 deaths in the control arm in subjects with MZL (HR [95% CI]: 2.89 [0.56, 14.92]); these 
results should however be interpreted with caution due to the low number of r/r MZL patients.  
Overall,  the  approvability  of  the  MZL  indication  was  contingent  on  the  assumption  of  homogeneity  of 
response between FL and MZL, which could not be demonstrated based on AUGMENT and MAGNIFY data; 
following these uncertainties, the MAH has withdrawn the proposed MZL indication.  
In order to adequately reflect the studied population, the following indication wording was proposed for 
section 4.1 of the SmPC: “Revlimid in combination with rituximab (anti-CD20 antibody) is indicated for 
the treatment of adult patients with previously treated follicular lymphoma (Grade 1 – 3a)”.  
Further, some characteristics of the patient population were specified (appropriateness to rituximab 
monotherapy and life expectancy < 6 months) in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The combination of Lenalidomide to Rituximab improves significantly the median PFS in patients with 
follicular lymphoma disease versus Rituximab alone; secondary endpoints ORR, OS and PFS 2 were also 
improved. Therefore the efficacy of the combination in the treatment of adult patients with previously 
treated follicular lymphoma (Grade 1 – 3a) has been adequately demonstrated.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety experience for lenalidomide in combination with rituximab (Len + Rit or R2) is primarily based 
on data from one registrational Phase 3 study (Study CC-5013-NHL-007, AUGMENT), and one supportive 
Phase 3b study (Study CC-5013-NHL-008, MAGNIFY ). The safety data from the R2 Arm in AUGMENT was 
pooled with the safety data from the R2 Arm in the Initial Treatment Period of MAGNIFY to increase the 
safety database in previously treated FL/MZL. 
The inclusion of safety data from only the Initial Treatment Period of MAGNIFY and not the extended 
treatment period is based on the following considerations: 
-Dose and schedule of lenalidomide in the MAGNIFY Initial Treatment Period are identical to those in 
AUGMENT. Depending on baseline renal function, (Cl Creat > 60 ml/min or >30 ml/min but < 60 ml/min) 
the starting dose of Lenalidomide or placebo was either 20 mg or 10 mg respectively.  
-Dose of rituximab in the MAGNIFY Initial Treatment Period is identical to AUGMENT, and the treatment 
schedule is similar to that in AUGMENT. The subtle difference in the schedule of rituximab between 
AUGMENT (4 weekly infusions followed by 4 additional doses on Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3, 4, and 5) and 
MAGNIFY (4 weekly infusions of rituximab followed by5 additional doses on Day 1 of Cycles 3, 5, 7, 9, 
and 11) is not expected to have a meaningful impact on therapeutic benefit or safety profile of R2 based 
on several considerations. The widely accepted standard dosing schedule of rituximab in previously 
treated iNHL is 4 weekly infusions of rituximab, which is identical between AUGMENT and MAGNIFY. The 
totality of published studies showed that extended dosing (ie, additional doses of rituximab beyond 
standard 4 weekly infusions) further improves benefit (limited added toxicities) in a manner that is 
independent of the number or schedule of extended rituximab dosing (eg, 4 or more doses every 1, 2, 3, 
or 6 months). 
For the Phase 2 clinical trial using lenalidomide monotherapy in iNHL (ie, Study NHL-001), the safety 
results are briefly summarized.

In AUGMENT study, two subjects (1.1%) in each treatment arm had a Grade 5 TEAE. In the R2 Arm, 
Grade 5 TEAEs included the following (in one subject each): 
• Arrhythmia occurring on Study Day 192 in a subject with FL. The investigator suspected a relationship 
of this TEAE to lenalidomide but not to rituximab. 
• Cardiopulmonary failure on Study Day 3 in a subject with MZL. The investigator did not suspect a 
relationship to lenalidomide or rituximab.  
In the Control Arm, Grade 5 TEAEs included the following (in one subject each):  
• General physical health deterioration on Study Day 214 in a subject with FL. The investigator did not 
suspect a relationship to placebo or rituximab.  
• Pneumonia on Study Day 70 in a subject with MZL. The investigator suspected a relationship to placebo 
and to rituximab.  
In MAGNIFY study, Grade 5 TEAEs were reported for 4 (1.8%) subjects (one subject for each TEAE): 
multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, sepsis, acute kidney injury, and cardio-respiratory arrest.  
In the Pooled AUGMENT and MAGNIFY Len + Rit Treatment Arm; Grade 5 TEAEs were reported for 6 
(1.5%) subjects (one subject for each TEAE): arrhythmia, cardiorespiratory arrest, cardiopulmonary

In the Safety Population, TEAEs in the AESI category of neutropenia were reported in 58.0% of subjects 
in the AUGMENT R2 Arm versus 22.8% in the Control Arm. During the Initial Treatment Period in the 
MAGNIFY study while on R2 treatment, the frequency of neutropenia events was 37.8%. Nearly all of the 
reported TEAEs in the AESI category of neutropenia were the PT of neutropenia. A small percentage of 
subjects in the pooled dataset (3%) had febrile neutropenia. Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia events were 
reported in 50.0% of subjects in the AUGMENT R2 Arm versus 13.3% in the Control Arm. 
In the AUGMENT study, less than one third of subjects in the R2 Arm with Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia had a 
concurrent infection (28/88 [31.8%]) and 9.1% (8/88) had a concurrent Grade 3 or 4 infection. Only 5 
subjects (2.8%) in the R2 Arm discontinued study treatment due to neutropenia. The median time to 
onset of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was approximately 14 weeks in the R2 Arm and 12 weeks in the 
Control Arm while the median time to improvement and resolution of the event was 9 days in both arms. 
Events of neutropenia were managed by dose modifications including dose reductions, dose interruptions, 
and/or growth factor support. In general, similar frequencies of TEAEs and Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs in the

Hematology 
The majority of parameters at baseline were Grade 1 or 2 in intensity. The percentages of subjects with 
post-baseline Grade 3/4 values ranged from 4.5% of subjects with Grade 3/4 anemia to 33.3% of 
subjects with Grade 3/4 neutropenia. Post-baseline, Grade 3/4 leukopenia was reported for 18.5% of 
subjects, Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was reported for 9.0% of subjects, and Grade 3/4 lymphopenia 
was reported for 24.3% of subjects. The changes observed in post-baseline hematology parameters were 
consistent with TEAEs of neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia.

Post marketing experience 
Not submitted with this application. For post-marketing data regarding lenalidomide, refer to the PSUR for 
the most recent reporting period (27 Dec 2016 through 26 Dec 2017) submitted on 02 Mar 2018. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety experience for lenalidomide in combination with rituximab (Len + Rit or R2) is primarily based 
on data from one registrational Phase 3 study (Study CC-5013-NHL-007, AUGMENT), and one supportive 
Phase 3b study (Study CC-5013-NHL-008, MAGNIFY). The safety data from the R2 Arm in AUGMENT was 
pooled with the safety data from the R2 Arm in the Initial Treatment Period of MAGNIFY to increase the 
safety database in previously treated FL/MZL.

In general, severity conditions criteria are higher in the arm R2 of the pooled results R2 than in the 
placebo arm: Grade IV Ann arbor stage disease is more frequent in the pooled R2 arm than in the 
placebo arm. (51.8 versus 31.8% respectively), proportion of patients with LDH elevated at baseline 
(25.6% versus 21.7% respectively), with bulky disease (34.9% versus 27.2% respectively), unfit for 
chemotherapy (36.4% versus 27.2% respectively).   
Common (>10%) Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE) are reported in the safety population and, 
in general, are more frequent in the R2 arm than in the placebo group: gastro-intestinal disorders (68.1 
versus 47.3%), general disorders (58.8 versus 46.6%), blood and lymphatic disorders (57.3 versus 
31.8%), infections and infestations (56.3 versus 45.9%), skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (56 
versus 22.3%), musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (46.1 versus 31.8%), respiratory 
thoracic and mediastinal disorders (44.6 versus35.1%), nervous system disorders (38.4 versus 23%), 
metabolism and nutrition disorders (37.5 versus 23%), investigations (34.1 versus 28.4 %), infusion 
related reaction (14.2% both), tumour flare (8 versus 0.7%) respectively. This is comprehensible.  
It follows the same trend for FL and MZL subgroups of patients, except that for MZL subgroups of 
patients, Psychiatric disorders are new common TEAE (18% in both arm).   
Furthermore, among common TEAE (>10%) causal relationship with Lenalidomide is not established. The 
applicant is asked to provide the adverse drug reaction (OC) 
In the safety population, a higher proportion of patients with at least one NCI CTCAE grade 3 or 4 TEAE 
are twice as high (65.1% in the pooled R2 arm versus 32.2% for R + placebo group). Proportion of 
patients with at least one related NCI CTCAE grade 3 or 4 TEAE are twice as high (55.8% in the pooled 
R2 versus 22.8% for rituximab and placebo group).  
Proportion of patients with at least one TEAE leading to dose reduction in the R2 arm is ten times the 
amount of those in the placebo group (35.7% in the pooled R2 versus 3.3% for Rituximab and placebo 
group). Proportion of patients with at least one TEAE leading to any study drug interruption in the R2 
pooled arm is twice the amount of those in the placebo group (14.6% in the pooled R2 versus 5.6% for 
Rituximab and placebo group).  
Grade 3-4 TEAE reported in at least 5% of safety population are exclusively haematologic disorders, that 
it is concordant with the known safety profile of Lenalidomide and Rituximab. The proportion of patients 
with a grade 3-4 TEAE reported in at least 5% is twice in the R2 arm. Haematologic disorders are a 
synergic effect of the combination of rituximab associated with Lenalidomide. The trend is the same for FL 
patients. Grade 3-4 TEAE reported in at least 5% of MZL population is slightly different with haematologic 
disorders, infections and infestations, infusion related reaction and Musculoskeletal and connective tissue 
disorders.  
As a conclusion across the two studies, in the safety population, association of Rituximab + Lenalidomide 
leads to more frequent grade 3 or 4 TEAES, more frequent dose reduction or treatment discontinuation 
A similar trend is observed in the FL and MZL population.  
Grade 5 TEAE had a fatal outcome and are involved in 4 System Organ Class: cardiac disorders, general 
condition, infections, renal and urinary disorders. . Grade 5 are equivalent between placebo arm and 
pooled R2 arm (1.1 versus 1.5% respectively). In this context, conclusion on the imputability of the 
disease condition or of the treatment arm is challenging and not clear.   
In general, Grade 3 or 4 AESI are more frequent in the pooled R2 arm than in the control arm, except for 
arterial thromboembolism (1.7% in the control group versus 0.3% in the experimental arm), bleeding 
(1.7% versus 0.3%), mixed thromboembolism (0.6% versus 0.3%), cardiac failure (0.6% versus 0% in 
the control versus experimental respectively). The trend is the same for FL and MZL subgroups of 
subjects.  
Neutropenia is the more frequent grade 3 or 4 AESI in any treatment arm and is three times higher in the 
experimental arm. (39.3% in the pooled R2 arm and 12.8% in the placebo group). Consequently, 
infections are more frequent also (13.3% versus 6.7%). Association of Rituximab and Lenalidomide have 
a synergic effect on hematologic disorders especially on Neutropenia.

Tumour flare reaction (TFR) is a very common adverse event in the experimental arm of the AUGMENT 
study (19/176=10.8%) and reported in the MAGNIFY R2 arm (9/222=4.1%). TFR are a well-known 
adverse event already reported in the safety profile of Lenalidomide when used for mantle cell lymphoma 
with the same frequency (10%). Only 1 subject in the AUGMENT R2 arm (0.6%) had grade 3 or 4 TFR 
and no patient had to discontinue lenalidomide/Rituximab therapy due to TFR. Association of 
Lenalidomide and Rituximab didn’t increase the risk and the grade of TFR, which remain, with a TFR 
prophylaxis, a manageable adverse event. This is acceptable. In the SmPC section 4.4 Careful monitoring 
and evaluation for TFR is recommended. Tumour flare may mimic PD. Patients who experienced Grade 1 
and 2 TFR were treated with corticosteroids, NSAIDs and/or narcotic analgesics for management of TFR 
symptoms. The decision to take therapeutic measures for TFR should be made after careful clinical 
assessment of the individual patient (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
Careful monitoring and evaluation for TLS is recommended (see SmPC section 4.4).  Patients should be 
well hydrated and receive TLS prophylaxis, in addition to weekly chemistry panels during the first cycle or 
longer, as clinically indicated (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
Subjects with at least one grade 3 or 4 TEAE of cutaneous reaction are three time as much in the group 
treated by R2 than in the placebo + Rituximab group (3.3% versus 1.1% respectively). Cutaneous 
reaction are well known adverse events in the safety profile of Lenalidomide and Rituximab. 
Potentialisation of the two drugs cannot be excluded.  
In the experimental arm, deaths during the treatment period are more frequent (10/398=2.5%) than in 
the placebo arm (2/180=1.1%). Death from adverse events are twice as high in the experimental arm 
than in the placebo group (1.3% versus 0.6%). Detail of grade 5 events and correlation with the 
treatment has been asked in the dedicated section (see previous section TEAE grade 5). 
Neoplasm benign, malignant and unspecified are higher in the pooled arm (16/398=4%) versus in the 
control arm (3/180=1.7%). Basal cell carcinoma are related in 5 subjects (1.3%) of the experimental 
arm. Squamous cell carcinoma are related in 6 patients of the experimental arm (versus 0 subject in the 
control arm) of the subgroups of follicular lymphoma patients. 
With regards to second primary malignancies, pooled data of the two studies AUGMENT (pivotal study) 
and Magnify study (supportive study) were provided with a median follow-up of 29.83 months and 10.25 
months respectively. Furthermore, data from RELEVANCE study, an ongoing phase 3 study randomized, 
active-controlled, open-label study of R2 for eighteen 4 week cycles followed by rituximab monotherapy 
for another six 8-week cycles (total duration of ~30 months) versus R- CHEMO for 6 to 8 cycles followed 
by rituximab for up to twelve 8-week cycles (total duration of 30 months), subjects with previously 
untreated FL (Grades 1 to 3a) was also provided with a median follow up of 39.1 months. Median follow 
up for the three studies are acceptable and judged sufficient to evaluate the risk.  
Data of study NHL-001 wasn’t reported because Lenalidomide was used in monotherapy and the median 
follow-up at the time of cut of date was 3.6 months. It was judged non contributive.  
The frequency of subjects with invasive SPMs (hematologic and solid tumour SPMs) was lower for the 
pooled R2 Arm (AUGMENT and MAGNIFY) compared with the Control Arm (AUGMENT) (9 [2.0%] versus 8 
[4.4%], respectively) (Table 8), with the incidence rates being lower (1.33 versus 1.97 per 100 person-
years, respectively) (Table 9). 
The frequency of subjects with invasive SPMs (hematologic and solid tumour SPMs) was lower for the 
pooled R2 Arm (AUGMENT and MAGNIFY) compared with the Control Arm (AUGMENT) (9 [2.0%] versus 8 
[4.4%], respectively) (Table 8), with the incidence rates being lower (1.33 versus 1.97 per 100 person-
years, respectively) (Table 9). However, the incidence of non-melanoma skin cancer in higher in the 
pooled R2 arm (2.25 per 100 person years (1.36-3.74) than in the control arm (0.73 per 100 person year 
(0.23-2.25). This is concordant with the previous results of serious adverse event reported in >2% of the 
pooled safety population where Neoplasm benign, malignant and unspecified are higher in the pooled R2 
arm (16/398=4%) versus in the control arm (3/180=1.7%).  
Assessment report

Data from the RELEVANCE study suggest an higher incidence rate of haematologic malignancies 
development with an incidence rates of 0.25 per 100 person-years in the R2 arm versus 0.12, 0.08 of R-
chemo, R-CHOP. Incidence rates in the arm R-Benda is higher (0.3 per 100 person-year).  
The HR of the difference between the R2 and R-aCHEMO KM cumulative incidence curves for hematologic 
SPMs is greater than 1.0, suggestive of a trend towards an increased risk of hematologic SPMs for the R2 
Arm versus the R-CHEMO Arm.  
In overall, in the RELEVANCE study the frequencies of subjects with invasive SPMs (hematologic and solid 
tumour SPMs) were similar for the R2and R-CHEMO Arms (25[4.9%] and 27[5.4%], respectively) with 
the incidence rates being similar (1.57 and 1.71per 100person-years, respectively). 
Grade 3 or 4 cardiac arrhythmia events were reported in 2.3% of subjects in the AUGMENT R2 Arm 
versus 1.1% in the Control Arm. During the Initial Treatment Period in the MAGNIFY study while on R2 
treatment, the frequency of events was 2.7%. The only PT within the AESI category reported in the 
pooled dataset at greater than 1% was syncope (1.3%). Arrhythmia was included in section 4.8 of the 
SmPC with an “uncommon” frequency. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
No unexpected safety signal was identified from the provided safety results. 
Association of Lenalidomide with Rituximab tends to potentiate adverse events especially haematologic 
disorders, tumour lysis syndrome and tumour flare syndrome. However, among common TEAE, adverse 
drug reaction are not established. Causal relationship between treatment by Lenalidomide + Rituximab 
and the development of non-melanoma skin cancer and haematologic malignancies is currently under 
further investigation.

2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Revlimid in combination with rituximab is proposed for the treatment of adult patients with previously 
treated follicular lymphoma (Grade 1- 3a). 
Follicular lymphomas (FLs) are the second most frequent subtype of nodal lymphoid malignancies. 
Treatment of FL is driven by the impact of disease symptoms and tumour burden on the patient, with the 
intent to improve and extend life, as options for curative treatment are lacking. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
At relapse of FL, selection of salvage treatment depends on efficacy of prior regimens. In early relapses 
(<12–24 months), a non-cross-resistant scheme should be preferred (e.g. bendamustine after CHOP or 
vice versa). Other options, including fludarabine-based, platinum- salts based or alkylating agents-based 
regimens, could also be useful. Rituximab should be added if the previous CD20 antibody-containing 
scheme achieved >6- to 12-month duration of remission. In symptomatic cases with low tumour burden, 
rituximab monotherapy can be proposed.  
Relapse and refractory indolent lymphoma (such as FL) remains an incurable disease. In previously 
treated iNHL follicular lymphoma patients, rituximab monotherapy is associated with ORR of 
approximately 38% to 59%. Over time many patients become refractory to rituximab. 
Obinutuzumab, another anti-CD 20 monoclonal antibody, has also been approved in combination with 
bendamustine followed by obinutuzumab maintenance for the treatment of patients with follicular 
lymphoma who did not respond or who progressed during or up to 6 months after treatment with 
rituximab or a rituximab-containing regimen, in whom it was associated with an ORR of approximately 
80%. 
Radioimmunotherapy (90Yyttrium– labelled ibritumomab– tiuxetan) is also authorised for the treatment 
of adult patients with rituximab relapsed or refractory CD20+ follicular B lymphoma; this could also 
represent an effective therapeutic approach in elderly patients with comorbidities not appropriate for 
chemotherapy as per Dreyling et al. ESMO 2016. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/693880/2019 
Page 134/139 
 
  
  
 
  
Finally, idelalisib is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with a FL that is 
refractory to two prior lines of treatment.  
Given the incurable nature of previously treated FL, the efficacy and safety limitations of current 
treatment options, and the fact that patients are typically older and with comorbidities, a high medical 
need exists for the development of novel treatment options associated with a more tolerable safety 
profile. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Results are mainly coming from a phase 3, double-blind randomized study designed to compare the 
efficacy and safety of rituximab plus lenalidomide versus rituximab plus placebo in subjects with 
relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma or relapsed/refractory marginal zone lymphoma (AUGMENT, N = 
358, including 295 with a FL). Supportive data from one phase 3b supportive study (MAGNIFY) were 
submitted. 
In the AUGMENT trial, Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive rituximab 375 mg/m2 every 
week in Cycle 1 and on Day 1 of every 28-day cycle from cycles 2 through 5 plus lenalidomide once daily 
on Days 1 to 21 of every 28-day cycle up to 12 cycles (experimental arm R2) or rituximab plus placebo 
(control arm). The ITT Population was comprised of 358 subjects. 
Efficacy determination was based upon PFS as primary endpoint, assessed by the Independent Review 
Committee (IRC). Secondary/exploratory endpoints were ORR, CR rate, DOCR, DOR, OS, EFS, TTNLT, 
TTNCT, PFS2, and time to histological transformation. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In the overall population in the AUGMENT trial, PFS by IRC assessment was significantly higher in the 
experimental arm than in the control arm (HR: 0.45 p<0.0001 95% CI = 0.33, 0.61). Results observed 
for the overall population were comparable to those in the FL subgroup (HR= 0.4; p<0.0001; 95% CI = 
0.29, 0.55), for which a 60% reduction in the risk of progression or death was found for the R2 Arm 
compared to the Control Arm. 
The objective response rate (CR+PR; %) by IRC assessment was significantly higher in the R2 arm in the 
overall population (77.5% 95% CI = 70.7; 83.4 versus 53.3% 95% CI= 45.8; 60.8) p<0.0001) and in 
the follicular lymphoma subgroup (80.3 % 95% CI =72.9; 86.4) versus 55.4% 95% CI = 47.0; 63.6) 
p<0.0001). 
Overall, the median DOR (95% CI) by IRC assessment per the 2007 IWGRC among responders was 36.6 
months (95% CI 22.9, not estimable [NE]) in the R2 Arm and 21.7 months (95% CI 12.8, 27.6) in the 
Control Arm. Similar results were noted in subjects with FL. 
Finally, in subjects with FL, there were 11 deaths in the R2 arm versus 24 deaths in the control arm 
reported (HR [95% CI]: 0.45 [0.22, 0.92]).  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
In patients with marginal zone Lymphoma, the combination of Lenalidomide with Rituximab did not 
appear to have any impact on the progression free survival and on objectives responses rates. More 
worrying, there were 5 deaths in the R2 Arm versus 2 deaths in the control arm in subjects with MZL (HR 
[95% CI]: 2.89 [0.56, 14.92]); these results should however be interpreted with caution due to the low 
number of r/r MZL patients. The approvability of the MZL indication was contingent on the assumption of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/693880/2019 
Page 135/139 
 
  
  
 
 
homogeneity of response between FL and MZL, which could not be demonstrated based on AUGMENT and 
MAGNIFY data; following these uncertainties, the MAH has withdrawn the proposed MZL indication. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety data from the R2 Arm in AUGMENT was pooled with the safety data from the R2 Arm in the 
Initial Treatment Period of MAGNIFY to increase the safety database in previously treated FL/MZL. 
Common (>10%) Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE) are reported in the safety population and, 
in general, are more frequent in the R2 arm than in the placebo group: gastro-intestinal disorders (68.1 
versus 47.3%), general disorders (58.8 versus 46.6%), blood and lymphatic disorders (57.3 versus 
31.8%), infections and infestations (56.3 versus 45.9%), skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (56 
versus 22.3%), musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (46.1 versus 31.8%), respiratory 
thoracic and mediastinal disorders (44.6 versus 35.1%), nervous system disorders (38.4 versus 23%), 
metabolism and nutrition disorders (37.5 versus 23%), investigations (34.1 versus 28.4 %), infusion 
related reaction (14.2% both), tumour flare (8 versus 0.7%) respectively. In the safety population, a 
higher proportion of patients with at least one NCI CTCAE grade 3 or 4 TEAE are twice as high (65.1% in 
the pooled R2 arm versus 32.2% for R + placebo group). Proportion of patients with at least one related 
NCI CTCAE grade 3 or 4 TEAE are twice as high (55.8% in the pooled R2 versus 22.8% for Rituximab and 
placebo group).  
Grade 3-4 TEAE reported in at least 5% of safety population are exclusively haematologic disorders. This 
is concordant with the known safety profile of Lenalidomide and Rituximab. The proportion of patients 
with a grade 3-4 TEAE reported in at least 5% is twice in the R2 arm. Haematologic disorders are a 
synergic effect of the combination of Rituximab associated with Lenalidomide. The trend is the same for 
FL patients. Grade 3-4 TEAE reported in at least 5% of MZL population is slightly different with 
haematologic disorders, infections and infestations, infusion related reaction and Musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders.  
Concerning grade 3 or 4 Adverse events of specific interest (AESI): In general, Grade 3 or 4 AESI are 
more frequent in the pooled R2 arm than in the control arm, except for arterial thromboembolism (1.7% 
in the control group versus 0.3% in the experimental arm), bleeding (1.7% versus 0.3%), mixed 
thromboembolism (0.6% versus 0.3%), cardiac failure (0.6% versus 0% in the control versus 
experimental respectively). Neutropenia is the more frequent grade 3 or 4 AESI in any treatment arm and 
is three times higher in the experimental arm. (39.3% in the pooled R2 arm and 12.8% in the placebo 
group). Consequently, infections are more frequent also (13.3% versus 6.7%). Association of Rituximab 
and Lenalidomide have a synergic effect on hematologic disorders especially on Neutropenia. 
Tumour flare reaction (TFR) is a very common adverse event in the experimental arm of the AUGMENT 
study (19/176=10.8%) and reported in the MAGNIFY R2 arm (9/222=4.1%). TFR are a well-known 
adverse event already reported in the safety profile of Lenalidomide when used for mantle cell lymphoma 
with the same frequency (10%)  
Concerning serious adverse event and deaths: In the experimental arm, deaths during the treatment 
period are more frequent (10/398=2.5%) than in the placebo arm (2/180=1.1%). Death from adverse 
events are twice as high in the experimental arm than in the placebo group (1.3% versus 0.6%).  
Concerning serious TEAE: Neoplasm benign, malignant and unspecified are higher in the pooled arm 
(16/398=4%) versus in the control arm (3/180=1.7%). Basal cell carcinoma are related in 5 subjects 
(1.3%) of the experimental arm. Squamous cell carcinoma are related in 6 patients of the experimental 
arm (versus 0 subject in the control arm) of the subgroups of follicular lymphoma patients. 
The frequency of subjects with invasive SPMs (hematologic and solid tumour SPMs) was lower for the 
pooled R2 arm (AUGMENT and MAGNIFY) compared with the Control Arm (AUGMENT) (9 [2.0%] versus 8 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/693880/2019 
Page 136/139 
 
  
  
[4.4%], respectively), with the incidence rates being lower (1.33 versus 1.97 per 100 person-years, 
respectively). However, the incidence of non-melanoma skin cancer is higher in the pooled R2 arm (2.25 
per 100 person years (1.36-3.74) than in the control arm (0.73 per 100 person year (0.23-2.25).This is 
concordant with the previous results of serious adverse event reported in >2% of the pooled safety 
population where Neoplasm benign, malignant and unspecified are higher in the pooled R2 arm 
(16/398=4%) versus in the control arm (3/180=1.7%). Data from the RELEVANCE study suggest an 
higher incidence rate of haematologic malignancies development with an incidence rates of 0.25 per 100 
person-years in the R2 arm versus 0.12, 0.08 of R-chemo, R-CHOP. Incidence rates in the arm R-Benda 
is higher (0.3 per 100 person-year).  
The HR of the difference between the R2 and R-CHEMO KM cumulative incidence curves for hematologic 
SPMs is greater than 1.0, suggestive of a trend towards an increased risk of hematologic SPMs for the R2 
Arm versus the R-CHEMO Arm. Consistent results were found from the supportive MAGNIFY study. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
As it is a known concern in the safety profile of Lenalidomide, the causal relationship of the higher 
proportion of non-melanoma skin cancer in the pooled R2 arm versus the Placebo + rituximab from the 
two main studies and the higher incidence rates of haematologic malignancies on the R2 arm from the 
RELEVANCE study has been discussed by the MAH. SPM is an important identified risk in the RMP, data 
from ongoing studies are awaited.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The main goal of treatment in previously treated patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) is to achieve deep 
durable remissions, with prolonged progression-free survival (PFS), in order to prevent disease-related 
complications without incurring significant treatment-related toxicities. In these patients, the treatment 
choice is based on duration of response (DoR) to prior therapies, types of prior therapies, and patient 
comorbidities (Johnson, 1995; Smith, 2013), as well as physician and patient preferences.  
The combination of Lenalidomide to Rituximab versus Rituximab alone improves significantly the median 
PFS in patients with follicular lymphoma disease. ORR, OS and PFS 2 are also improved by the 
combination of Lenalidomide and Rituximab. AUGMENT study participants were patients with Grade 1 to 
3a FL; the indication, adequately reflects the concerned population. The wording in the Summary of 
Product Characteristics (SmPC) Section 5.1 was modified to adequately describe the study population 
included based on the AUGMENT protocol requirements.   
Considering the safety profile and as expected, the association of Lenalidomide + Rituximab increases the 
proportion of treatment emergent adverse events, leads to more frequent grade 3 or 4 TEAE, more 
frequent dose reduction or treatment discontinuation. Second primary malignancies are listed as 
“identified risk” in the RMP, relevant warnings in line with the other indications are included in the SmPC.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Data from the Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind controlled study CC-5013-NHL-007 
(AUGMENT) show that patients with previously treated FL who can tolerate lenalidomide in combination 
with rituximab (R2) demonstrated a highly statistically significant and clinically meaningful PFS benefit 
over rituximab plus placebo and a significant improvement in secondary efficacy parameters. 
The combination remains manageable despite unfavourable effects especially in the context of an 
incurable disease for which potential therapeutic alternatives are limited.    
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
In patients with marginal zone lymphoma, no impact on the PFS of the association R2 has been shown. 
The MAH has withdrawn this indication from this application.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Blincyto is a bispecific T-cell engager antibody construct that binds specifically to CD19 expressed on the 
surface of cells of B-lineage origin and CD3 expressed on the surface of T-cells. It activates endogenous 
T-cells  by  connecting  CD3  in  the  T-cell  receptor  (TCR)  complex  with  CD19  on  benign  and  malignant  B-
cells.  Treatment  with  Blincyto  is  associated  with  a  rapid  depletion  of  peripheral  B-cells,  accompanied  by 
T-cell activation, and a transient increase in cytokine.  
Blincyto  is  currently  authorized  for  the  treatment  of  adults  with  Philadelphia  chromosome-  negative 
relapsed or refractory B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in USA (2014) and in EU (2015). 
The  initial  approval  is  conditional,  based  upon  a  phase  2  single  arm  study  (MT103-211).  The  Specific 
Obligation  (SO)  of  this  conditional  approval,  additional  efficacy  and  safety  data  from  the  phase  3  study 
“Post-authorisation  efficacy  study  (PAES):  Study  00103311  (TOWER):A  Study  of  BITE  antibody  Blincyto 
versus  standard  of  care  chemotherapy  in  adult  subjects  with  relapsed/refractory  b-precursor  acute 
lymphoblastic  leukemia  (ALL).”  were  submitted  on  November  2016  to  re-evaluate  the  clinical  B/R  of 
Blincyto, to better quantity the magnitude of its treatment effect and to help better differentiate between 
the AEs associated with Blincyto and those associated with cytotoxic chemotherapy.   
This type II variation seeks to broaden the existing Blincyto indication for ALL to include all adult patients 
with  minimal  residual  disease  (MRD)  positive  B-precursor  ALL.  For  the  new  proposed  indication,  the 
pivotal study MT103-203 is an ongoing phase 2, open-label, single-arm study in adults with MRD-positive 
B-cell  precursor  ALL  (N=116),  which  is  supported  by  an  exploratory  phase  2  study  MT103-202  (N=21) 
and historical comparator study in patients with MRD-positive ALL (study 20120148). 
ALL is a rare aggressive cancer of the blood and bone marrow with a prevalence of 23 and 27 per 
100,000 persons for the US in 2010 and in the EU in 2008 respectively. In the EU, more than 7200 new 
cases are diagnosed annually with approximately 40% occurring in adults and the majority are B-lineage, 
Philadelphia chromosome-negative ALL. The 5-year OS rate in adults is around 30-40%. Although up to 
90% of newly diagnosed adult patients with ALL achieve an initial CR, up to 50% of patients experience 
relapse.  
Assessment report  
EMA/847661/2018 
Page 8/125 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
For patients achieving CR, persistence of MRD is the strongest prognostic feature for relapse after 
achieving CR regardless of treatment choice or risk classification system, and patients who are highly 
responsive to induction chemotherapy and achieve an MRD level below 1 x 10-4 (MRD-negative) have a 
favourable prognosis. Assessment of MRD is commonly used clinically to evaluate the depth of response, 
categorize the level of risk of relapse, and to aid in treatment decisions.  
Available data have shown that MRD negativity at the end of induction therapy is a strong and 
independent prognostic indicator for relapse risk, as highlighted by NCCN in its recommendation for MRD 
assessment. However, clinical evidence is still too limited to consider MRD negativity as a validated 
surrogate primary endpoint of clinical benefit especially in a small single-arm pivotal trail. Indeed, as yet, 
no randomized and controlled studies had established that a treatment effect on MRD could quantitatively 
explain a treatment effect in terms of validated endpoints such as EFS or OS. 
The efficacy of Blincyto in the claimed extension of indication is “treatment of patients with MRD-positive 
B-cell precursor ALL”, is based on data from one pivotal phase 2, open-label, single-arm study 
(MT103-203) in adult subjects with MRD-positive B-cell precursor ALL (N=116); further supported by 
Study MT103-202, a phase 2, open-label, single-arm study in adult subjects with MRD-positive B-cell 
precursor ALL (N=21). Rate of MRD response was the primary endpoint in both the MT103-202 and 
MT103-203 studies. A patient-level historical comparator study (Study 20120148) and a Propensity Score 
Analysis were also conducted to substantiate the relevance of the single-arm trial data from Study 
MT103-203 in adult subjects with MRD-positive B-cell precursor ALL. 
There were several scientific advices for Blincyto in the treatment of patients with MRD-positive ALL on 
clinical aspects (CHMP Protocol assistance EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/788794/2009, 17/12/2009).  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP.

2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
No new dose-response studies have been submitted. For the treatment of MRD-positive ALL, in both 
studies MT103-203 and MT103-202, Blincyto was administrated as a continuous IV infusion at a body 
surface area (BSA)-based dose of 15 µg/m2/day for 4 weeks followed by a 2-week infusion-free interval.  
The proposed posology is a fixed dose regimen of 28µg/day (4weeks on / 2 weeks off) and patients may 
receive 1 cycle of induction and 3 additional cycle of Blincyto consolidation treatment. 
2.4.2.  Main study 
Study MT103-203 “A confirmatory multicenter, single-arm study to assess the efficacy, safety, and 
tolerability of the BiTE® antibody Blincyto in adult patients with minimal residual disease (MRD) of B-
precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia” 
Methods 
This is a pivotal, open-label, multicentre, single arm, uncontrolled phase 2 study to support the efficacy of 
Blincyto in patient with MRD positive B-precursor ALL. It was conducted at 46 centers in Austria, Belgium, 
Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Romania, Russia, Spain, and the United Kingdom 
A primary analysis CSR for this study was generated on 24 September 2014 (cut-off date: 21 February 
2014). Since that time, a secondary analysis was completed and a CSR generated on 28 January 2016 
with more mature time-to-event data when all subjects had the opportunity to complete the 18 month 
follow-up period (cut-off date for the secondary analysis: 05 August 2015). The long-term follow-up of 
this study is still ongoing; the final analysis is planned after all subjects had the opportunity to be 
followed for 5 years from the start of Blincyto therapy expected for quarter 1 2019.

free period of 14 days, which may be prolonged for up to 7 days if necessary. Subjects in haematological 
remission generally were expected to receive 4 cycles of treatment. In the event of haematological 
relapse within the treatment period, Blincyto was terminated.  
Upon completion of 1 cycle of treatment, all subjects were assessed for MRD response. The study design 
is presented below. 
The core study was defined as follows: completing the day 29 visit of 4 cycles for subjects not proceeding 
to HSCT and completing of at least day 29 of cycle 1 for subjects proceeding to HSCT. Efficacy follow-up 
visits including bone marrow assessment occurred at months 9, 12, 18 and 24 months after the start of 
treatment, then survival follow-up visits by phone every 6 months until year 5.

equivalent, methotrexate 15mg, cytosine arabinoside 40mg) prior to C1, at the end of C2 and C4; also 
every 3months after until at least M18 for subject who did not undergo HSCT. 
Before the start of each cycle on day1 a corticosteroid (prednisone 100mg IV or equivalent) was given. In 
case of neurologic event oral dexamethasone was administered at a dose of at least 24mg/day for up to 
3days and an appropriate prophylactic anticonvulsant treatment in case of seizure. 
Objectives 
The primary Objective is to evaluate the efficacy of Blincyto to induce complete MRD response

- to evaluate the overall survival in subjects with ALL treated with Blincyto 
- to evaluate the effect of Blincyto on 100-day mortality rate associated with allogeneic HSCT 
- to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Blincyto 
- to evaluate the effect of Blincyto on duration of MRD negativity 
- to evaluate the effect of Blincyto on the kinetics of MRD 
- to evaluate subject’s quality of life during and after therapy 
- to evaluate resource utilization 
An exploratory Objective is to assess potential biological predictors of response to Blincyto 
Outcomes/endpoints  
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was the proportion of subjects who achieved a complete MRD 
response defined by the absence of MRD after 1 cycle of treatment with Blincyto evaluated by the central 
MRD laboratory (University of Kiel, Germany). Evaluation of MRD was performed on bone marrow (BM) 
aspirate specimens. A second bone marrow sample may have been collected in the case that the first 
specimen did not clearly reveal a complete MRD response. This second sample was considered 
confirmatory for the primary endpoint of complete MRD response.  
At baseline, subjects were potentially eligible for enrolment based on the finding of MRD at a level of≥ 
10-3 at the local laboratory. An aliquot of ≥ 5 mL of BM was required for the baseline central MRD review.  
After each treatment cycle (day 29) and during the efficacy follow-up visits, a BM aspiration/biopsy was 
performed by the local laboratory to evaluate the degree of BM infiltration defined by the percentage of 
leukemic blasts in BM (as per cytological assessment). Furthermore, in the event of abnormal blood 
counts (suggesting leukemic relapse), a BM evaluation should have been performed prior to initiating the 
subsequent cycle of treatment with Blincyto.   
Definitions of Treatment Response Evaluation 
Complete MRD: No PCR amplification of individual rearrangements of Ig- or TCR-genes was detected after 
completion of the first cycle. All subjects with established PCR based MRD assay who had been treated 
with Blincyto within the first cycle and had a post-treatment BM sample obtained at the end of infusion of 
cycle 1 were evaluable for MRD response assessment. 
MRD Relapse: Reappearance of individual rearrangements of Ig- or TCR-genes ≥ lower limit of 
quantification (LLOQ) (usually 10-4) for at least 1 individual marker measured by an assay with a 
sensitivity of minimum 10-4 in subjects who had achieved MRD response. 
MRD Progression: The increase in the MRD level by 1 log as compared to the baseline level, which is 
equal to a 10-fold increase in the number of MRD cells. 
Sample size 
The sample size estimation for the primary efficacy endpoint “proportion of patients who achieve 
complete MRD response after one cycle of treatment with Blincyto” was based on Fleming's standard 
single-stage procedure but using the exact binomial distribution. The following statistical hypotheses for 
the primary efficacy endpoint was tested in this clinical study: H0: π ≤ p0 vs H1: π ≥ p1 
The sample size parameters for this endpoint was p0 = 44%, p1 = 61%, a one-sided type I error of 2.5% 
and a power of 90%. p0, the MRD response probability, which, if true, meant that Blincyto was not worth 
Assessment report  
EMA/847661/2018 
Page 13/125 
 
  
  
studying further, was estimated to be not higher than 44%. The future use of Blincyto would be of 
considerable interest if the true MRD response probability (π) was 61% or higher (p1). 
According to these parameters, 100 patients were required, i.e. the study had a 90% power of 
demonstrating that the 97.5% one-sided exact confidence interval for the MRD response rate excluded 
44% (p0) if the true unknown response rate was 61% (p1). If the study concluded with at least 55 out of 
100 patients (55%) showing a complete MRD response after one cycle of treatment with Blincyto, one 
was able to reject H0. 
EMA scientific advice suggested that recruitment of more patients would be desirable if they could be 
recruited in the planned time frame. Thus, if the recruitment rate was higher than currently anticipated, 
up to 130 evaluable patients might be recruited. In case more than 100 evaluable patients were recruited 
in this study the following parameters would be adjusted for the primary efficacy endpoint: 
N=110 patients: H0 could be rejected with 60/110 (=55%) of MRD negative patients 
N=120 patients: H0 could be rejected with 64/120 (=53%) of MRD negative patients 
N=130 patients: H0 could be rejected with 69/130 (=53%) of MRD negative patients 
The sample size determination for the Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoint has been performed based on 
assumptions of historical data. Currently available historical data of 80 patients showed that 14 out of 80 
patients (17.5%) were hematological relapse-free after one year. In a conservative manner this data was 
used for the estimates of the 18-month time point. A two-sided 95% confidence interval of this rate had 
an upper limit of 28%. Thus, it was considered clinically meaningful, if patients treated with Blincyto had 
a probability of at least 28% to be hematological relapse-free after 18 months (i.e. if the lower limit of 
the 95% confidence interval for the rate of hematological relapse-free patients observed in this study was 
at 28% or higher). 
The statistical concept for analyzing the key secondary endpoint was based on the Kaplan-Meier 
estimates (product-limit estimator) of hematological relapse at 18 months from start of treatment with 
Blincyto. The following statistical hypotheses for the key secondary endpoint were tested in this clinical 
study: H0: π ≤ p0 vs H1: π ≥ p1 
Power calculation for the key secondary endpoint with a p0 of 28% and a one-sided type one error of 
2.5% was done by simulation based on sampling from an exponential distribution. For rates of patients 
without hematological relapse after 18 months between 48% and 55% (p1), 10,000 trials were generated 
with a random drop-out-probability rate of 10% and with varying rates for HSCT (60%, 67% and 75%). 
If available, the onset of HSCT was simulated after 1.5 months on study from an exponential distribution 
with a median time to transplant of 1.5 months. This would insure no transplant earlier than 1.5 months 
after initiation of Blincyto and most of the transplant occurring during the first 6 months. The rate of 
significant trials among 10,000 repetitions [i.e. trials where the lower boundary of the two-sided 95% 
Greenwood confidence interval was above 28%] calculated as the power under the respective rates. 
Accordingly, this study would have a 90% power of demonstrating that the lower boundary of the 95% 
confidence interval (based on Greenwood’s formula, Collett, 2003) for the Kaplan-Meier point estimate of 
the RFS rate at 18 months excludes 28% (p0) if the true unknown rate of patients without hematological 
relapse at 18 months is 55% (p1) and if the HSCT availability rate was not >67%. Under these 
assumptions, if the observed KM rate at 18 months was approximately 43%, one would be able to reject 
H0.

This was an open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
The primary analysis was performed with all data available at the time when all patients had the 
opportunity to be evaluated for the primary efficacy endpoint i.e. complete MRD response after the first 
treatment cycle (cut-off date: 21 February 2014).  An updated analysis focusing on the key secondary 
endpoint was carried out after all subjects had been transplanted, relapsed, died or had 18 months of 
follow-up (cut-off date: 05 August 2015).  The final analysis will be carried out 5 years after the last 
patient has been enrolled (last patient last visit expected in January 2019). 
Analysis Sets were:  
Analysis of Safety Endpoints (FAS): All subjects who received any infusion of Blincyto (intention-to-treat 
principle in single-arm open-label studies). 
Primary endpoint full analysis set (Prim EP FAS): all subjects with an Ig or TCR PCR MRD assay with the 
minimum required sensitivity of 1 x 10-4 at central lab established at baseline. 
Primary endpoint efficacy set (Prim EP Efficacy Set): subjects in prim EP FAS above, in hematological 
complete remission (CR) at treatment start, with MRD level ≥ 1 x 10-3 as per central lab at screening 
baseline and 1 follow up sample in cycle 1 at central lab available unless samples are not available due to 
discontinuation because of a Blincyto-related adverse event or disease progression/relapse 
Primary endpoint per protocol set (Prim EP PPS): subjects in Prim Efficacy Set above and who did not 
have any major relevant protocol violation which could have an impact on the primary efficacy endpoint 
(initial and early stage protocol violations) 
Key secondary endpoint full analysis set (Key Sec EP FAS): all subjects from the FAS excluding 
Philadelphia-positive subjects and in hematological CR at treatment start 
Key secondary endpoint per protocol set (Key Sec EP PPS): subjects in Key Sec EP FAS above and who 
did not have any major relevant protocol violation which could have an impact on the key secondary 
efficacy endpoint (late stage protocol violations.) 
HSCT secondary endpoint full analysis set (HSCT Sec EP FAS): all subjects from FAS who underwent 
HSCT prior to relapse (hematological or extramedullary) excluding Philadelphia-positive subjects  
HSCT secondary endpoint per protocol set (HSCT Sec EP PPS): as HSCT Efficacy Set above and who did 
not have any major relevant protocol violation which could have an impact on the key secondary efficacy 
endpoint (late stage protocol violations) 
Secondary endpoint per protocol set (Sec EP PPS): as FAS and in hematological CR at treatment start 
who did not have any major relevant protocol violation which could have an impact on the key secondary

A number of changes were made to the initial SAP including: Clarifications that the key secondary 
endpoint would be reported after all subjects have been transplanted, relapsed, died, or had 18 months 
of follow-up; update of analyses sets and the definitions of the primary and key secondary endpoints ; 
addition of the analysis of HSCT secondary endpoint set ; updates to the planned analyses, protocol 
violations, type and number of tables, listings, and graphs; addition of definition of a completed cycle and 
haematological relapse, the covariate of MRD level at baseline, details regarding 100-day mortality, ECG 
analysis, more details regarding PK analysis, and events of interest (EOIs). 
Protocol deviations and treatment compliance 
Overall, 46.6% (54/116) of subjects had at least 1 relevant protocol violation during enrollment. Six 
subjects had protocol violations that led to exclusion from the Prim EP PPS set: 3 subjects received 
systemic chemotherapy within 2 weeks prior to Blincyto treatment; 2 subjects received a prohibited, 
chronic, systemic high-dose corticosteroid before an MRD assessment; 1 subject received a prohibited 
anti-tumor therapy before an MRD assessment.

excluding  subjects  who  had  an  event  or  were  censored  before  day  45,  with  a  total  of  107  subjects 
included in the analysis. A total of 52.9% (45/85) subjects with complete MRD response at cycle 1 were 
alive  without  relapse  at  the  end  of  the  follow-up  period,  compared  with  20.0%  (3/15)  of  subjects  who

were  MRD  non-responders  including  9  subjects  with  quatifiable  MRD  –positivity  and  6  patients  with 
MRD<LLOQ. 
The  median  RFS  time  was  17.9  months  longer  for  subjects  with  an  MRD  complete  response  at  cycle  1 
(23.6 months, 95% CI: 17.4 months to n.e.) compared with subjects who were MRD non-responders (5.7 
months, 95% CI: 1.6 to 13.6 months). The 18-month KM estimate was 58% (95% CI: 46% to 68%) in 
subjects with MRD complete response compared with 20% (95% CI: 5% to 42%) in subjects who were 
MRD non-responders.

Subjects in CR1 at the time of treatment with Blincyto, censored at HSCT or post-Blincyto chemotherapy, 
had a noticeably longer RFS than those in CR2 or CR3 (not estimable [95% CI: 6.3 months to n.e.] 
versus 7.1 months [95% CI: 4.2 months to 9.3 months], respectively). The results were similar without 
censoring at HSCT or post-Blincyto chemotherapy.

Impact of HSCT on haematological RFS 
The subject incidence of HSCT after Blincyto treatment was 77.6% (90/116) in the FAS. Of the 90 
subjects who had an HSCT, 76 (84.4%) subjects were in CR at the time of HSCT, with 19 (21.1%) 
subjects being MRD-positive and 57 (63.3%) subjects being MRD-negative, and 14 (15.6%) subjects had 
hematological relapse prior to HSCT. The median time from 1st dose of Blincyto to HSCT was 3.05 
months.

Two landmark analyses were performed on the Key Sec EP FAS, with the landmark at 3M and 6M after 
the first dose of Blincyto in order to compare RFS time in subjects with HSCT with those did not have a 
transplant. The median RFS from the landmark at 3M was 22.1 months (95% CI: 12.0 months to n.e.) for 
subjects without HSCT and it was 6M shorter (16.1 months, 95% CI: 11.3 months to n.e.) for subjects 
who received HSCT. The similar trend was also observed at the 6M landmark analysis, the median RFS 
was not estimated for subjects without a transplant (n.e. 95% CI: 4.4 months to n.e.), it was 29.2 
months (95% CI: 13.2 to n.e.) in subjects who received an HSCT.

otherwise censored. The median RFS for subjects in the HSCT Sec EP FAS was 20.9 months (95% CI: 
14.6 months to n.e.). The 18-month KM estimate was 55% (95% CI: 42% to 66%). Not unexpectedly, 
RFS was longer in subjects with related rather than unrelated donors (NE versus 18.7 months), and in 
subjects with matched versus mismatched donors (20.8 versus 16.2 months).

Impact of MRD response on OS – Day 45 Landmark analysis 
The impact of MRD response on OS was compared via a landmark analysis starting from day 45 in Prim 
EP FAS subjects (N = 112). The analysis excluded subjects who died or were censored before day 45. In 
the subgroup of subjects achieving complete MRD response at C1, 62.5% (55/88) of subjects were alive 
at the end of FU period (and censored), compared with 33.3% (8/24) of subjects who did not have 
complete MRD response. The median OS time (from day 45) was 28.4 months longer for subjects who 
had a complete MRD response at cycle 1 (38.9 months, 95% CI: 33.7 months to n.e.) compared with 
subjects who were MRD non-responders (10.5 months, 95% CI: 3.8 months to n.e.). The 18M KM for OS 
was 69% (95% CI: 58% to 78%) in subjects who had MRD complete response compared with 31% (95%

Landmark analyses were conducted to compare the OS in subjects who received HSCT (bleu) and those 
who did not (red). Subjects who died before the landmark date were excluded from the analysis; 
otherwise subjects were stratified based on whether they received or did not receive HSCT at the 
landmark date. Landmarks included 3 months and 6 months after the first dose of Blincyto. Among 
subjects who were alive at 3 months, the median overall survival was 21.2 months (95% CI: 13.0 
months to n.e.) in subjects who received HSCT on or before 3 months, and 33.5 months (95% CI: 17.6

Time to Haematological Relapse 
Time to hematological relapse was measured from the start of Blincyto infusion until the subject 
experienced hematological or extramedullary relapse. Subjects who died or received HSCT or post-
Blincyto chemotherapy after Blincyto were censored at their last hematological assessment prior to death 
or HSCT or post-Blincyto chemotherapy (whichever occurred first). 
In the Key Sec EP FAS (N = 110), a total of 82.7% (91/110) of subjects were censored as of the data 
cutoff and 17.3% (19/110) subjects had events: 16.4% (18/110) had a relapse and 0.9% (1/110) had 
secondary leukemia. The 18-month KM estimate for TTHR, censored at HSCT or post-Blincyto 
chemotherapy, was 55% (95% CI: 34% to 72%); the median TTHR was not estimable (95% CI: 7.1

Duration of Complete MRD Response 
The median duration of MRD response was analysed as the time from onset of MRD negativity until MRD 
or hematological relapse or date of last confirmation of negative MRD status. Only the subjects with MRD 
CR at cycle 1 were included in this analysis. 
The results were analysed with and without censoring at the time of HSCT or post-Blincyto chemotherapy.

45.0 months) when censored at the time of HSCT or post-Blincyto chemotherapy. The 18-month KM 
estimates were 46% (95% CI: 33% to 57%) and 51% (95% CI: 28% to 69%), respectively.

Historical comparator study 20120148:  “A retrospective analysis of Hematological RFS and OS in 
adult patients with Philadelphia-negative B-precursor ALL in complete hematological remission with MRD” 
Historical data collection: between 02/10/2013 and 14/03/2014 from Czech Republic, France, Germany, 
UK, Italy, Poland, Spain and Russian study group data bases. The objective was to estimate the mortality 
rate (proportion) at 100 days following alloHSCT in patients who received an alloHSCT after MRD 
detection. 
Research methods 
Study design 
Study 20120148 was a retrospective non-interventional cohort study of historical treatment and outcome 
data from MRD-positive subjects with Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-cell precursor ALL who had 
achieved complete haematological remission through receiving standard-of-care treatment according to 
national study protocols. The study population was assembled from patient databases of ALL study 
groups in Europe and Russia that included MRD testing in their protocols. All subjects who were treated at 
participating study group facilities, diagnosed with ALL in the year 2000 to 2013.  
Study population 
The direct comparison analysis set (DCAS) was a post-hoc additional analysis set defined as follows: 
- 
adult subjects ≥18 years with Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-cell precursor ALL 
-  with MRD at a level of ≥ 1x 10-3 (molecular failure or molecular relapse) detected by PCR or by 
flow cytometry (i.e. regardless of detection method) 
- 
- 
time to relapse from the date of MRD detection greater than 14 days  
in CR1 (defined as less than 5% blasts in bone marrow after at least 3 intensive chemotherapy 
blocks, i.e. any standard or investigational regimen according to adult protocols)

initial diagnosis of ALL occurred in the year 2000 or later 
-  Subjects were excluded from the analysis if they had extramedullary disease at the time point of 
MRD detection, were exposed to Blincyto within 18 months of MRD detection, or underwent 
allogeneic HSCT before MRD detection at required level.

Results 
Disposition and demographics 
182 subjects of a total population of 287 patients (FAS) constituted post-hoc DCAS. 32.4% of the 
subjects had their initial ALL diagnosis between 2000 and 2004, 58.8% were diagnosed between 2005 
and 2010, with only 8.8% being diagnosed after 2010. German (n=70), Italy (n=47), France (n=25) and 
Poland (n=25) contributed to more than 90% of dataset.

Table 38: A summary of key results  
Propensity Score analysis 
Objective: 
A propensity score analysis was conducted to compare historical control Study 20120148 subjects with 
the clinical study MT103-203 subjects with respect to RFS and OS in the DCAS after making adjustments 
for each study patient’s propensity score and controlling for HSCT.  
To meet the RFS and OS comparison objectives, the first step was to achieve adequate balance between 
historical control population and the Blincyto study population using a propensity score approach. Once 
this balance was achieved, RFS and OS analyses were conducted by making adjustments for each 
patient’s propensity score. 
Endpoints:  
The primary endpoint was RFS, defined as the time from the baseline date until the first event of 
hematological or extramedullary relapse, secondary leukemia, or death due to any cause, whichever 
occurs first (Cheson, 2003). The secondary endpoint was OS. Patients who did not have an event were 
censored on the date of their last hematological assessment. 
OS was defined as the time from the baseline date until death from any cause. Patients who did not die 
were censored on the last date the patient was known to be alive.  
Assessment report  
EMA/847661/2018 
Page 58/125 
 
  
  
 
 
The baseline date for both relapse-free and overall survival was defined as 14 days after the MRD 
baseline date for historical control patients and the date of the first Blincyto treatment for Blincyto 
patients. 
Study Design/Type:  
This was a retrospective, post-hoc propensity score analysis of adult patients with MRD of B-precursor 
acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The propensity score in this context was the propensity to be treated with 
Blincyto. 
Methods:  
The databases from the MT103-203 study and historical control study were merged programmatically and 
used for analysis. Data from the historical control study 20120148 were filtered to match the key 
inclusion criteria from the MT103-203 study so that key study endpoints could be summarized to provide 
a historical context to the Blincyto efficacy results from the MT103-203 study. Because the historical data 
mostly included patients in first remission, only that patient subgroup was analyzed for the primary 
analysis. In addition to the primary analysis which included patients in their first remission with MRD>1 x 
10-3 detected at baseline by PCR or flow cytometry, two additional analysis sets were defined: (1) 
restricting the data to only those with baseline MRD detected by PCR, and (2) including subjects in 2nd 
and 3rd remission. Separate propensity score analyses were performed for each analysis set. 
Propensity scores were derived for each patient via a variable selection algorithm for logistic regression 
models that included age at primary diagnosis, sex, country, presence of t(4;11)MLL-AF4, time from 
primary diagnosis to MRD baseline, baseline MRD level, white blood cells at diagnosis, and the GMALL 
regimen as prior chemotherapy. The dependent variable for these models was whether or not the subject 
was treated with Blincyto (i.e. came from the MT103-203 study). The propensity score-based weight 
formula chosen was that for average treatment effects (ATE), which estimates the average treatment 
effect from moving the entire population from untreated to treated (Imbens, 2004). This approach 
mirrors the objective of a randomized study. For an exploratory sensitivity analysis, average treatment 
effect of the treated weights were also considered (ATT). 
Inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTW) were derived from the scores for each subject according 
to their treatment status, and the balance between the two groups with respect to the baseline 
covariates, after weighting, was assessed primarily by evaluating standardized differences. To reduce the 
influence of extreme IPTW values, stabilized IPTW (sIPTW) were applied for the primary analysis. RFS 
and OS were then analysed using weighted Cox proportional hazard models with the treatment indicator 
as a baseline covariate and including a time-varying covariate for HSCT. A hazard ratio (HR) and 95% 
confidence interval (CI) were calculated to measure the risk of RFS or death among Blincyto-treated 
subjects relative to historical controls. Sensitivity analyses excluding the HSCT time-varying covariate 
were conducted in order to ascertain robustness. RFS and OS estimates at specific time-points could only 
be calculated from the models that did not adjust for HSCT.  
Results 
Covariate balance was assessed before and after weighting, calculating standardized differences between 
treatment groups, and using univariate models for each covariate with treatment as the predictor. 
Covariate balance before and after adjustment according to sIPTW for the primary analysis set is shown 
in Table 15.

EMA/847661/2018 
Page 59/125 
 
  
  
For this analysis, stabilized IPTW provided the best overall balance of baseline covariates. All but 1 
stabilized IPTW adjusted covariate achieved standardized differences less than 0.2 (the standard 
acceptance cutoff), with only 1 borderline at 0.2. The overlap in the propensity scores between the 2 
treatment groups was considered adequate with the criterion that was pre-specified in the statistical 
analysis plan.

Primary endpoint: RFS 
The RFS hazard ratio and 95% CI based on the Cox Proportional Hazard model with sIPTW and adjusting 
for HSCT was estimated at 0.50 (0.32, 0.78), suggesting a statistically significant 50% reduction in the 
risk of relapse or death associated with Blincyto compared to historical controls.  
The 18-month RFS (unadjusted for HCST) was estimated at 0.39 (95% CI = 0.33 to 0.48) for control and 
0.67 (95% CI= 0.58 to 0.78) for Blincyto, representing a 1.7 fold increase in 18-month RFS. Kaplan-
Meier based median RFS (95% CI), unadjusted for HSCT, was estimated at 8.3 months (6.2, 11.8) for 
control and 35.2 months (24.2, NE) for Blincyto representing a 26.9 month improvement in median RFS. 
Assessment report  
EMA/847661/2018 
Page 61/125 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Secondary endpoint: OS 
The OS hazard ratio and 95% CI based on the Cox proportional hazard model with sIPTW and adjusting 
for HSCT was estimated at 0.76 (0.47, 1.24), suggesting a directional, but not significant, improvement 
associated with Blincyto compared to historical controls. The 18-month OS (unadjusted for HCST) was 
estimated at 0.55 (95% CI = 0.48 to 0.63) for control and 0.71 (95% CI= 0.62 to 0.81) for Blincyto, 
representing a 1.3 fold increase in 18-month OS. Kaplan-Meier based median OS (95% CI), unadjusted 
for HSCT, was estimated at 27.2 months (16.4, 38.6) for control and 36.5 months (24.2, NE) for Blincyto, 
representing a 9.3 month improvement in median OS. 
The use of propensity score adjustments was successful in creating a balanced population of Blincyto-
treated and control subjects with respect to numerous important baseline covariates. This balance 
allowed for more valid statistical comparisons between the 2 treatment groups that demonstrated a 
statistically significant improvement in RFS associated with the use of Blincyto (hazard ratio = 0.50, 95% 
CI: 0.32, 0.78), as well as a directional improvement in OS (hazard ratio = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.47, 1.24), 
though not statistically significant. Results of the endpoint analyses were largely consistent across 
analysis sets and sensitivity analyses. Exploratory analyses with alternative propensity score weightings 
(average treated effect of the treated weights; ATT) suggest a more pronounced treatment effect for OS 
in favor of Blincyto.

Exploration of HSCT effect: 
In order to further evaluate the potential impact of HSCT on the OS treatment effect, additional Cox 
models were generated with the addition of an interaction term for the treatment group and the time-
dependent HSCT covariate and through the use of sIPT weights. With the addition of this term, there was 
evidence of an interaction effect (p=0.0795). Blincyto was associated with a meaningful improvement in 
OS prior to or in the absence of HSCT (HR = 0.405, 95% CI = 0.165 to 0.995) but there was no 
difference in OS following HSCT (HR = 1.03, 95% CI = 0.611 to 1.748). Similarly, undergoing an HSCT 
was associated with an improvement in OS for the historical control group (HR = 0.617, 95% CI = 0.400 
to 0.952) but there was no improvement in OS among the Blincyto group (HR = 1.57, 95% CI = 0.594 to 
4.167).

Study MT103-202 was an exploratory, open-label, multicenter, single-arm, phase 2 study in adult 
subjects with MRD-positive B-cell precursor ALL. Subjects were ≥ 18 years of age and were in complete 
hematologic remission with molecular failure or molecular relapse starting any time after consolidation I 
of front-line therapy (after at least 3 intense chemotherapy blocks) with GMALL standards or any time 
outside GMALL standards. Subjects had MRD at a level of ≥ 1x 10-4 in any assay with a minimum 
sensitivity of 1 x 10-4. The study was conducted at 6 centers in Germany. The study was planned with a 
Simon’s 2-stage design. Under the original study design, a minimum of 7 subjects were planned to be 
treated if the study was stopped at stage 1 and a minimum of 14 and a maximum of 21 subjects if the 
study continued to stage 2 (n= 7 each in stage 1 and stage 2). The first 4 subjects were enrolled in stage 
1 and received cIV infusion of blinatumomab at 15 μg/m2/day over 4 weeks followed by a treatment-free 
period of 2 weeks (1 cycle = 6 weeks). After 1 cycle of blinatumomab treatment, a data review 
committee reviewed the data from these subjects as prespecified by the protocol.  
In 3 of 4 subjects, responses were observed by the data review committee. Thus, the protocol was 
amended twice on 27 October 2008 and 24 March 2009 which permitted dose escalation of blinatumomab 
to 30 μg/m2/day after cycle 1 for subjects without a positive response. Responders were defined as 
subjects with MRD negativity and subjects who did not respond (nonresponders) were defined as subjects

with an MRD level not reduced by ≥ 1 log within 4 treatment cycles or within 2 years of treatment 
completion. Subjects who were positive for bcr/abl and received concomitant treatment with a TKI during 
cycle 1 of blinatumomab treatment and who did not respond received 15 μg/m2/day of blinatumomab in 
cycle 2 without a TKI. If the subject did not respond after 2 cycles at 15 μg/m2/day of blinatumomab, the 
dose was increased to 30 μg/m2/day of blinatumomab. 
Study participants: 
Key inclusion criteria:  
1. B-precursor ALL adult patients in complete hematological remission with molecular failure or molecular 
relapse starting at any time after consolidation I of frontline therapy within GMALL standards or at any 
time outside GMALL standards 2.  
2. Patients with molecular marker for evaluation of MRD, which is either: bcr/abl and/or t(4;11) 
translocation at any detection level measured by RT-PCR, or individual rearrangements of 
immunoglobulin or TCR-genes measured by an assay with a sensitivity of minimum 10-4: at least 1 
individual marker at a quantitative level ≥ 10-4. 
3. ECOG Performance Status ≤ 1 
Key exclusion criteria 
Current extra-medullary involvement; history of or current relevant CNS pathology; current infiltration of 
cerebrospinal fluid by ALL; any prior alloHSCT or HSCT within 6 weeks prior to study entry; recent cancer 
immune-chemotherapy or radiotherapy prior to study treatment; abnormal bone marrow function 
(defined as WBC < 3.000/μL, Platelets < 50.000/μL), renal or hepatic function; active severe infection. 
Treatment duration: 
Subjects who showed neither MRD progression nor response received up to 7 cycles of treatment.  
In subjects who had achieved MRD response, 3 additional cycles of treatment were administered, starting 
from the time of the first record of MRD negativity (up to a maximum of 10 cycles were possible). 
Study endpoints: 
The primary endpoint of this study was MRD response rate, which was measured by the incidence of 
subjects with MRD negativity/response (bcr/abl and/or t[4;11] below detection limit and/or individual 
rearrangements of immunoglobulin or TCR genes below 10-4) within 4 cycles of treatment with 
blinatumomab 
Secondary Endpoints:  
- MRD response rate defined by the incidence of MRD negativity after any treatment cycle 
- Time to hematological relapse  
- Change in MRD level. MRD progression is defined as the increase in the number of MRD positive cells by 
one log level as compared to the baseline level, which is equal to a 10-fold increase in the number of MRD 
positive cells. Progression has to be confirmed within six weeks. The time point of progression is the date 
of the first measurement. 
- Time to molecular relapse as defined by the period from the first detection of MRD negativity until the 
first detection of relapse. Molecular relapse is defined by the detection of bcr/abl, and/or t(4-1 1 1) 
translocation at any level, and/or by the detection of individual rearrangements of immunoglobulin or

TCR-genes in ≥10-4 cells measured by an assay with a sensitivity of minimum 10-4. Molecular relapse 
has to be confirmed within six weeks. 
- Overall incidence and severity of adverse events 
- Quantification and characterization of peripheral blood lymphocytes 
- Cytokine serum concentrations 
- Pharmacokinetic parameters: serum half-life, maximum concentration, area under the curve, volume of 
distribution and clearance of MT103 
Statistical methods: 
The following hypotheses were tested in this study: H0: π ≤ p0 = 5% vs. H1: π ≥ p1 = 30%. 
P0, the MRD response probability, which, if true, means that the agent was not worth studying further, 
was estimated to be not higher than 5%. The future use of blinatumomab would be of considerable 
interest if the true MRD response probability (π) was 30% or higher (p1). 
General considerations were based on Simon’s 2-Stage MinMax design with the following specifications:  
p0 = 0.05, p1 = 0.3, alpha = 0.05, power = 0.8.  
A total sample size planned: 21 
Summary of Results: 
First subject enrolled: 08 January 2008 
Data cut-off date for primary analysis: 14 January 2010 
Date of long-term follow-up analysis: 03 November 2014 
Subject Disposition: 
A total of 32 subjects were screened in this study and 20 subjects were included in the FAS (all subjects 
from the safety analysis set [SAS; n = 21] who completed at least treatment cycle 1 and for whom at 
least 1 MRD response assessment was available). One subject in the SAF completed < 1 cycle of 
blinatumomab treatment and, thus, was not included in the FAS.

MRD response was achieved within the first 4 cycles in 80% (16/20) of subjects in the FAS, with all MRD 
responses from positive to negative were achieved within cycle 1 including 15 complete MRD responders 
receiving 15µg/m2/d and 1 subject achieved MRD complete response with escalated dose at 
15/30µg/m2/d.  
By refractory and relapsed MRD, MRD response was achieved in 80% (12/15) of subjects with molecular 
refractory disease and in 80% (4/5) of subjects with molecular relapse.  
By MRD level at screening, MRD response was achieved in 90% (9/10) of subjects with MRD level ≥ 10-2, 
83% (5/6) of subjects with MRD level < 10-2 to ≥ 10-3, and 50% (2/4) of subjects with MRD level < 10-
3 to ≥ 10-4. 
MRD progression 
Seven of 20 subjects overall had MRD progression, the overall median time to MRD progression was 7.2 
months (95% CI: 3.3, n.e.). MRD progression was reported in 6 of 17 subjects who received 
Assessment report

blinatumomab 15 μg/m2/day and occurred at days 84, 99, 101, 170, 221, and 438 respectively; 1 
subject of the 3 with escalated dose at 15/30 µg/m2/d had an MRD progression at day 206.  
Duration of MRD Response 
The median duration of MRD response for the 16 subjects who had an MRD response in the FAS overall 
was 13.0 months (95% CI: 2.8, n.e.). 5 subjects had MRD relapse. All 5 subjects received blinatumomab 
at 15 μg/m2/day. The follow-up duration for the 11 subjects who did not experience MRD relapse 
(censored) raged from 15 to 1955 days. 
Relapse-free Survival 
As in pivotal study, hematologic RFS was assessed during the long-term follow-up analysis and was 
calculated from the time of start of the first infusion until hematologic relapse or death. Subjects without 
an event were censored on their last available date of bone marrow biopsy.  
After a median follow-up time of 1550 days (> 4 years) the median RFS was not reached (95% CI: 12.4 
months, not estimable). Of the 20 subjects in the FAS, 11 subjects completed the study in hematologic 
remission and 9 subjects had an RFS event (8 hematologic relapses on days 99, 129, 155, 198, 582, 947, 
1352, and 1550; and 1 death). Three of the 8 subjects who had hematological relapse had HSCT prior to 
haematological relapse. When subjects were censored at the date of HSCT, the median RFS was also not 
reached (95% CI: 5.1 months, not estimable): 6 out of 20 subjects (30%) completed the study in 
remission (censored), 9/20 subjects (45%) were censored at HSCT, and 5/20 subjects (25%) had a 
relapse event.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
To  support  this  variation,  a  single  pivotal  study  (MT103-203)  was  submitted  together  with  a  supportive 
study  (MT103-202)  and  a  retrospective  historical  study  (study  20120148).  Indirect  comparisons  with 
historical studies by propensity score analysis were also submitted. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Pivotal study MT103-203 is a multicentre, open-label, single-arm, uncontrolled phase 2 study enrolling 
116 adult subjects with MRD-positive B-cell precursor ALL in complete hematological remission with the 
presence of MRD at a level of ≥10-3 in an local assay with a minimum sensitivity of 10-4 documented 
after an interval of at least 2 weeks from last systemic chemotherapy. Philadelphia chromosome-positive 
(Ph+) patients should have documented treatment failure of or intolerance/contraindication to at least 2 
TKIs. Patients should not receive prior allogeneic HSCT.

Blincyto was used as monotherapy at a dose of 15µg/m2/day at a constant flow rate over 28 days per 
treatment cycle followed by an infusion-free period of 14 days. Patients could receive up to 4 cycles 
regardless of whether or not achieved MRD response at the end of C1. The dose of 15µg/m2/day for this 
pivotal study was based on 2 clinical trials: phase 1 study in patients with R/R NHL (Study MT103-104) 
and supportive phase 2 study in MRD-positive B-precursor ALL (Study MT103-202). This dose was given 
for 1 to 7 cycles in Study MT103-202 and shown to be efficacious at achieving a MRD response with an 
acceptable safety profile. BSA-based dosing was used in pivotal and supportive studies in MRD, while a 
fixed dosing was proposed in SmPC. The switch from BSA-based dosing to fixed dosing had been justified 
by population PK analysis based on an integrated dataset of 8 studies, and considered acceptable for 
patients at least 45 kg in weight. Indeed, similar exposure levels had been observed with either 15 
µg/m2/day BSA-based dosing or the 28µg/day fixed dosing across clinical studies and supported by a PK 
simulation regardless of indications, as assessed in initial MAA.  
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was the proportion of subjects who achieved a complete MRD 
response defined by the absence of MRD after 1 cycle of treatment with Blincyto evaluated by the central 
MRD laboratory. As yet, MRD has not been used as a surrogate endpoint in ALL studies; the 
appropriateness of MRD response as a validated surrogate endpoint of direct clinical benefit should be 
established by robust evidence based on a documented and measurable correlation between MRD status 
and validated endpoints such as OS or EFS. However, although available data have shown that MRD 
negativity at the end of induction therapy is a strong and independent prognostic indicator for relapse 
risk, no randomized and controlled studies have established a treatment effect on MRD could 
quantitatively explain a treatment effect in terms of validated endpoints such as EFS or OS.   
Furthermore, the application consisted of only one single-arm pivotal study with a small sample size that 
used a non-validated biological outcome, which makes it extremely difficult to draw any firm conclusions 
on the efficacy. In this context, additional efficacy data from better-designed trials are necessary to 
confirm that the magnitude of the MRD response in Study MT103-203 can be translated into clinically 
measurable benefit and that the efficacy is not outweighed by the risk of the treatment in a population at 
a relatively subclinical stage. 
The diagnosis of MRD status at inclusion was based on local lab analyses either by PCR or by MFC per 
protocol. The primary efficacy endpoint, the complete MRD response rate after 1 cycle of Blincyto 
infusion, was based on central lab MRD assessment.   
The key secondary endpoint was defined as the hematological RFS rate at 18 months following initiation 
of Blinctyo, evaluated in Ph-negative ALL subjects censored at HSCT or post-Blincyto chemotherapy, by a 
central laboratory. Other secondary efficacy endpoints included OS, mortality rate within 100 days after 
allogeneic HSCT, time to hematological relapse (TTHR), duration of complete MRD response, effect on 
MRD level, subject’s quality of life during and after therapy. Per guideline, RFS, OS and TTHR were 
calculated from the time of the bone marrow aspiration when CR or CRh* was detected for the first time, 
until the date of documented hematological relapse, progressive disease, extramedullary relapse, or 
death due to any cause, whichever occurred earlier. However, in this study, they were calculated from 
initiation of Blincyto instead of detection of CR for the first time. The time of CR detection varied from 1 
month to several years before the first dose of Blincyto in participating subjects. These heterogeneous 
intervals between the time of CR detection and 1st dose of Blincyto could bias RFS/OS calculation at 
inclusion.   
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The pivotal study enrolled 116 adult subjects with MRD-positive B-cell precursor ALL in complete 
hematological remission with the presence of MRD at a level of ≥10-3, without prior HSCT. The majority 
of studied population was Ph-negative (111/116) and in first CR (CR1 64.7%). 
Assessment report

Among 116 subjects in FAS, 83 subjects (71.6%; 83/116) completed the core study defined as 
completing the D29 visit of 4 cycles for non-transplanted patients and a least the D29 visit of 1 cycle for 
transplanted subjects. Majority of subjects completed core study (83/116). The median duration of the 
core study was 2.7 months. Two major reasons for not completing the core study included adverse 
events (17.2%; 20/116) and disease relapse (8.6%; 10/116). 46.6% (54/116) of subjects who had at 
least 1 major protocol violation. 19 of 116 subjects were not included in primary endpoint PPS, and 20 
subjects were not included in key secondary endpoint PPS.   
RFS  was  calculated  from  initiation  of  Blincyto  in  this  study,  but  not  calculated  by  the  consensus  from 
detection of CR for the first time. However there was a wide variation in time from last anti-ALL treatment 
to first dose of Blincyto (Min, Max: 0, 55M) as well as in time from diagnosis to 1st dose of Blincyto (Min, 
Max 3, 208M).  
A  complete  MRD  response  rate  was  observed  within  the  first  cycle  in  77.9%  (88/113;  95%  CI:  69.1, 
85.1) of subjects. 2 additional subjects had a complete MRD response at day 66 and day 77 respectively. 
The overall complete response rate for the Prim EP FAS was 79.6% (90/113; 95% CI: 71.0, 86.6), with a 
median  time to  complete MRD  response of  29  days (range:  5  to  71  days).  The  MRD  complete  response 
achieved at cycle 1 was sustainable, with a median duration of 17.3 months. 
These  results  suggest  a  strong,  rapid  and  sustained  activity  of  Blincyto  in  MRD-negativity  in  subjects  in 
CR with MRD+ ALL. 
RFS was calculated from initiation of Blincyto in this study in Ph-negative subjects at 18 months. The 18-
month KM estimate for haematological RFS, censored at HSCT or post-Blincyto chemotherapy, was 54% 
(95%  CI:  33%  to  70%)  with  not  estimable  median  RFS  (95%  CI:  6.3  months  to  not  estimable  [n.e.]). 
The  RFS  was  17.9  months  longer  in  MRD  complete  responders  than  in  MRD  non-responders  (23.6M  vs 
5.7M)  according  to  a  landmark  analysis  from  day  45.  RFS  (not  censored  at  HSCT  or  post-Blincyto 
chemotherapy) was 13.6 months longer in patients in CR1 than in CR2 or CR3 (24.6M vs 11.0M). Relapse 
history  before  Blincyto  treatment  seemed  to  represent  a  potential  predictive  factor  on  RFS  outcome, 
although a high level of MRD-negativity was obtained in both CR1 (82.2%) and CR2 (71.1%) subgroups.  
After at least 18M follow-up, the median of OS, calculated from initiation of Blincyto, was not estimable. 
Nearly twice as many subjects who had an MRD complete response than MRD non-responders were alive 
as  of  the  data  cut-off  date  (62.5%  vs  33.3%).  The  median  OS  was  28.4m  longer  for  complete  MRD 
responder  at  C1  compared  with  MRD  non-responder.  The  18-months  OS  uncensored  at  HSCT  or  post 
Blinatumomab chemotherapy is 65%.  
MRD non-responder at C1 had a median TTHR clearly shorter than in MRD complete responder (13.6m vs 
NE). 
In the supportive study (MT103-202) conducted in 21 adult subjects with MRD-positive (≥ 1x 10-4) B-cell 
precursor  ALL,  a  high  MRD  response  rate of  80% was  observed  which  was  similar  to  that  in  the  pivotal 
study. All MRD responses were observed within the first cycle of Blincyto, with a median duration of MRD 
response  of  13.0M.  The  median  of  KM  estimate  of  hematologic  RFS  was  not  estimable  after  a  median 
follow-up  time  more  than  4  years.  Due  to  small  size,  uncontrolled  design  and  differences  in  Blincyto 
posology and permitted TKIs, this trial has only an informative value: it only brings some support to the 
activity of Blincyto in MRD-negativity. 
Per guideline, RFS, OS and TTHR should be calculated from the time of the bone marrow aspiration when 
CR  or  CRh*  was  detected  for  the  first  time,  until  the  date  of  documented  hematological  relapse, 
progressive  disease,  extramedullary  relapse,  or  death  due  to  any  cause,  whichever  occurred  earlier. 
However,  in  this  study,  these  clinical  endpoints  were  not  well-defined.  They  were  calculated  from 
initiation  of  Blincyto  instead  of  detection  of  CR  for  the  first  time,  while  the  time  of  CR  detection  varied 
from 1 month to several years before the first dose of Blincyto in patients. These heterogeneous intervals 
Assessment report  
EMA/847661/2018 
Page 73/125 
 
  
  
between the time of CR detection and the first dose of Blincyto could bias RFS/OS calculation at inclusion. 
True RFS/OS calculated from the time of the bone marrow aspiration when CR or CRh* was unknown.  
The  study  population  represents  adult  non-transplanted  patients  having  Ph-negative  ALL  in  CR/CRi 
without associated poor prognosis. The activity of Blincyto in Ph-positive patients was unknown.  
Of 53 deaths, 23 occurred while the subjects were in CR after HSCT (23 out of a total of 90 subjects who 
received  HSCT  after  starting  Blincyto,  25.6%),  and  only  3  deaths  occurred  in  subjects  achieved  a  CR 
without  undergoing  HSCT  (3  out  of  a  total  of  26  subjects  who  did  not  receive  HSCT,  11.5%).  Some 
transplanted  patients  died  even  30  months  after  their  HSCT.  Uncertainties  exist  in  reasons  of  all  fatal 
outcomes and their causality relative to Blincyto, to HSCT or to disease progression.  
Landmark analysis by HSCT status showed that median RFS and OS were shorter in transplanted subjects 
than in non-transplanted subjects after Blincyto. It is still questionable how Blincyto could hide the benefit 
of HSCT, and the increased mortality in subjects who received HSCT after treatment with blinatumomab 
is  not  understood.  Possible  deleterious  effects  of  HSCT  in  subjects  after  achieving  MRD-negativity  by 
Blincyto cannot be clearly excluded.  
Furthermore,  the  exploration  of  HSCT  effect  in  propensity  score  analysis  clearly  demonstrated  a 
paradoxical phenomenon: In the absence of HSCT, Blincyto group reduced 60% of death as compared to 
historical  control,  while  this  clinically  meaningful  improvement  was  not  observed  in  subjects  with  HSCT. 
Paradoxically,  in  historical  control  arm,  the  risk  of  mortality  was  reduced  by  38%  in  subject  with  HSCT 
than  without  HSCT.  While,  in  Blincyto  arm,  this  risk  of  mortality  was  increased  by  57%  in  subject  with 
HSCT than without HSCT. 
Some  indirect  comparisons  with  limited  reliability  by  nature  were  performed  between  pivotal  study  and 
post-hoc collected historical data. No clear conclusion can be drawn from this external comparison.  
To  conclude,  as  the  application  consisted  of  only  one  confirmatory  uncontrolled  small  size  pivotal  study 
which used a questionable biological outcome, the positive benefit of Blincyto in the claimed population is 
extremely  difficult  to  assess.  In  this  context,  it  is  necessary  to  have  additional  efficacy  data  to  confirm 
that the magnitude of the MRD response in Study MT103-203 can be translated to clinically measurable 
benefit and that the efficacy is not outweighed by the risk of the treatment in a population at a relatively 
subclinical stage. 
The  studied  population  in  Study  MT103-203  represented  an  adult  non-transplanted  patients  having  Ph-
negative ALL without associated poor prognosis, in CR1/CR2 after induction and consolidation therapies of 
chemotherapy  with  MRD  ≥10-3.  The  MAH  provided  additional  data  by  separating  14  subjects  who  had 
undergone HSCT after relapse post-blinatumomab from non-HSCT group. 10 of 14 subjects had died as of 
August  2015  cut-off,  the  outcome  was  worse  in  these  subjects  than  in  subjects  without  HSCT  or  in 
subjects with HSCT in CR (death rate was 71.4%, 57.7% and 52.6% respectively).  
The  submitted  data  of  this  single-arm  small  size  uncontrolled  Study  MT103-203  indicate  that  outcome 
(RFS,  OS)  of  subjects  in  CR  who  underwent  the  HSCT  was  not  better  than  those  without  HSCT  after 
blinatumomab treatment. Considering the totality of the information, no clear conclusions can be drawn.  
Three randomized, controlled, phase 3 studies are currently ongoing: 
-  Study  E1910,  a  phase  3,  randomized,  controlled  study  to  assess  the  effect  of  blinatumomab  in 
combination with induction chemotherapy compared with induction chemotherapy alone for adult patients 
(30 through 70 years of age) with newly diagnosed Ph-negative B cell ALL. HSCT is not mandated in this 
study. 
-  Study  AALL1331,  a  phase  3,  randomized,  controlled  study  to  assess  efficacy  and  safety  of 
blinatumomab  compared  with  standard  combination  chemotherapy  in  treating  patients  (≥  1  to  <  31 
Assessment report

years) with B cell ALL that has returned after a period of improvement (relapsed). HSCT is mandated in 
this study. 
-  Study  20120215,  a  randomized,  open-label,  controlled,  phase  3  study  to  investigate  the  efficacy  and 
safety  of  blinatumomab  as  consolidation  therapy  versus  conventional  consolidation  therapy  in  pediatric 
subjects (> 28 days to < 18 years of age) with high risk (HR) first relapse B-cell precursor ALL. HSCT is 
mandated in this study. 
All  three  phase  3  studies  have  robust  designs,  validated  and  well-defined  clinical  endpoints  as  well  as 
post-HSCT follow-up, and have the potential to provide high quality and long-term data in patients with 
B-ALL. Despite the fact that patient populations in these phase 3 studies are different to the one covered 
by  the  proposed  claimed  MRD  indication,  these  phase  3  randomised  studies  together  with  two 
observational studies to collect data are considered important in resolving uncertainties in the context of 
a rare and serious disease where unmet medical is high.  
At  this  stage,  data  are  still  immature  to  conclude  on  positive  efficacy  of  Blinatumomab  in  MRD  positive 
patients.   
Additional expert consultation 
The SAG-O was consulted on the following questions:  
1.  Do  the  experts  consider  ALL  with  MRD-positivity  for  patients  already  in  complete 
haematological remission (e.g. CR1) as unmet medical need?  
Persistent MRD-positivity in adult patients after induction therapy and/or consolidation therapy in 
complete haematological remission (e.g. CR1) is considered an unmet medical need. The main goal in 
these patients is inducing MRD-negativity of sufficient duration to allow for stem-cell transplantation, the 
only potentially curative option in this setting with otherwise very poor prognosis.  
In a recent meta-analysis, MRD-negativity was shown to be correlated with event-free survival (EFS) and 
OS at patient-level.1 Although data on blinatumumab were not included and the correlation may differ 
across mechanisms of action, the strength of the correlation was remarkable (HR for EFS and OS <0.3) 
and homogeneous across a number of different (chemotherapy) agents. A priory, there are no reasons to 
suspect that the correlation would be significantly different for blinatumomab.   
Furthermore, the risk of relapse has been shown to be directly proportional to the MRD level.2 Although 
protocols vary in this respect (e.g., paediatric protocols), persistence of MRD-positivity is also seen as 
important, with e.g., week 16 persistence being chosen as the threshold for the poorest prognosis 
(German Multicenter ALL Study Group).  
However, MRD-negativity has not been validated as a surrogate endpoint for importanty clinical outcomes 
for blinatumumab or indeed any other agents. All these considerations make MRD a reasonably likely 
surrogate endopint for clinical benefit but cannot be considered as a validated surrogate endpoint. 
In conclusion, MRD-negativity is a useful endpoint for benefit-risk decisions to accelerate regulatory 
approval in areas of high unmet need such as the indication applied for. However, confirmation should be 
provided prospectively in terms of important clinical endpoints.  
There was a concern about the finding that blinatumomab followed by allogeneic hematopoietic cell 
transplantation may be associated with slightly higher mortality although this effect was not well 
understood and based on small numbers (study MT103-203). Further analyses of this apparent effect 
should explore main characteristics of the allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation procedures, 
including conditioning regimen (reduced intensity conditioning, RIC; myeloablative conditioning, MAC) 
and donor (HLA-matched sibling; well-matched unrelated adult, MUD; or HLA-haploidentical relative).

The collection of safety and efficacy data in a registry for patients treated with blinatumomab and HSCT 
should be requested as post-marketing study to monitor long-term efficacy and safety 
Longer follow-up on OS should be collected and presented post-approval to address some of the 
uncertainty about long term outcome for the randomized trial in patients with relapsed/refractory ALL 
(TOWER). Data from the ongoing ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group (Combination Chemotherapy With 
or Without Blinatumomab in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed BCR-ABL-Negative B Lineage Acute 
Lymphoblastic Leukemia, NCT02003222) should also be presented post-approval.  
2.  As  yet,  no  randomized  and  controlled  data  have  demonstrated  that  a  MRD  response  to  a 
treatment could  quantitatively explain a treatment effect in terms of clinical benefit (e.g. 
OS,  EFS).  Please  discuss  whether  MRD  can  be  used  as  a  surrogate  primary  endpoint  for 
measuring the direct clinical benefit. 
See answer to question No. 1. 
3.  If  MRD  positivity  is  accepted  as  a  component  for  a  therapeutic  indication,  would  the 
experts  recommend  that  a  specific  validated  method  is  prospectively  developed  any 
treatment  is  approved,  or  would  local  diagnostic  procedures  available  so  far  be 
acceptable?  If 
local  procedures  are  possible,  what  are  the  specific  technical 
recommendations needed in the product information? 
Real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) is the current gold standard for the analysis of MRD. This method is 
generally  considered  more  robust  than  multicolour  flow  cytometry  particularly  in  the  setting  of  Ab 
treatments  or  next-generation  sequencing.  The  method  is  available  in  the  EU  and  many  centers  are 
accredited  according  to  the  guidelines  of  the  EuroMRD  Consortium,  a  standard  that  has  been  widely 
recognised.  Regardless  of the  specific guidelines,  it is  important  that  local procedures  follow  established 
technical  guidelines  for  the  interpretation  of  RQ-PCR  MRD  data  based  on  knowledge  of  Ig/TCR  gene 
rearrangements, experience in Ig/TCR gene analysis and RQ-PCR for MRD detection, and number of ALL 
patients per year. 
4.  Complete MRD response was defined as no detection of PCR amplification of individual 
rearrangement of Ig- or TCR-. Please discuss if such MRD response induced by Blincyto 
is  considered  equivalent  to  MRD-negativity  “spontaneously”  achieved  by  front-line 
chemotherapy on both of prognostic and biologic aspect. 
See  answer  to  question  No.  1  about  the  need  for  confirmation  of  long-term  effects  (EFS,  OS)  with 
blinatumumab, and some added uncertainty in extrapolating results for chemotherapy to blinatumomab. 
5.  MRD-positivity 
is  defined  as  ≥  10-3  at 
inclusion.  Please  discuss  under  what 
circumstances  in  case  of  MRD_positivity  a  treatment  is  justified,  and  if  the  magnitude 
of Blincyto effect on MRD can be translated to real clinically benefit.  
The risk of relapse has been shown to be directly proportional to the MRD level (see answer to question 
No. 1). Although no optimum cut-off has been established, 10-3 is not considered stringent enough as it 
probably selects patients just prior to morphological relapse. A more stringent cut-off of 10-4 is likely to 
be preferred for patient selection, given the expected prognostic implications. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
At present, there are still uncertainties associated with the design of the uncontrolled, small size pivotal 
study, definition of the endpoint, translation of the observed efficacy in terms of Minimal Residual Disease 
(MRD) to survival, and uncertainties on the impact of the treatment on potential HSCT after

blinatumomab and on long-term outcomes. Furthermore, MRD-negativity has also not been validated as a 
surrogate endpoint for important clinical outcomes for blinatumumab. Therefore efficacy has not been 
conclusively demonstrated on the basis of the data provided. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Blincyto is currently indicated for the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-negative R/R B-cell 
precursor ALL. The safety profile in SmPC was mainly based on one pivotal Phase II Study MT103-211 
where 189 adult patients with R/R ALL received Blincyto, administered as a continuous intravenous 
infusion (CIVI). The initial dose of blinatumomab is 9 μg/day for the first 7 days of treatment (to mitigate 
for potential CRS and neurologic events associated with introduction to blinatumomab) which then will be 
escalated (dose step) to 28 μg/day starting on day 8 (week 2) through day 29 (week 4) of the cycle 1 
and for up to 5 cycles.  
In the approved indication (R/R ALL), the most serious adverse reactions that may occur during 
blinatumomab treatment include: infections (31.7%), neurologic events (16.4%), neutropenia/febrile 
neutropenia (15.3%), cytokine release syndrome (0.5%), and tumour lysis syndrome (0.5%). The most 
common adverse reactions include: infusion-related reactions (67.2%), infections (63.0%), pyrexia 
(59.8%), headache (34.4%), febrile neutropenia (28%), peripheral oedema (25.9%), nausea (24.3%), 
hypokalaemia (23.8%), constipation (20.6%), anaemia (20.1%), cough (18.5%), diarrhoea (18.0%), 
tremor (17.5%), neutropenia (17.5%), abdominal pain (16.9%), insomnia (15.3%), fatigue (15.3%) and 
chills (15.3%). Events of special interest (EOI) for blinatumomab included central neuropsychiatric events 
due to direct neurotoxicities (neurologic events), infections, CRS, TLS, elevated liver enzymes, infusion 
reactions, acute pancreatitis, embolic and thrombotic events, medication errors and product use issues, 
cytopenias (including febrile neutropenia and neutropenia), lymphopenias, capillary leak syndrome (CLS), 
decreased immunoglobulins, and leukoencephalopathy (including progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy [PML]). 
A total of 843 subjects from 8 clinical studies received blinatumomab, including 706 subjects with 
relapsed/refractory ALL from 6 clinical studies and 137 subjects in the adult MRD-positive ALL population 
from 2 clinical studies. In support of the present variation in MRD, the safety of blinatumomab is based 
on data from pivotal Study MT103-203, a pivotal, phase 2, open-label, single-arm study in adult subjects 
with MRD-positive B-cell precursor ALL (N = 116) and supportive study MT103-202, a phase 2, open-
label, single-arm study in adult subjects with MRD-positive B-cell precursor ALL (N = 21). 
Patient exposure 
In Study MT103-203 Blincyto was used as monotherapy at a dose of 15µg/m2/day at a constant flow rate 
over 28 days per treatment cycle followed by an infusion-free period of 14 days. Patients could receive up 
to 4 cycles regardless of whether or not achieved MRD response at the end of C1.  
The core study was defined as follows: completing the day 29 visit of 4 cycles for subjects not proceeding 
to HSCT and completing of at least day 29 of cycle 1 for subjects proceeding to HSCT. 
Safety analyses were performed on the FAS that included all subjects who received ≥ 1 dose of Blincyto 
and who had at least 1 available MRD response assessment.  
The data cut-off date for the primary analysis of Study MT103-203 was 21 February 2014 (with all 
subjects completing the core study period); the data cut-off date for the secondary analysis (18-month 
follow-up was 05 August 2015). Study MT103-203 is ongoing for collection of OS data; no additional 
Assessment report

safety data will be collected. Study MT103-202 is complete; CSRs for the primary analysis and final 
analysis are included in this submission. 
In the FAS, 116 subjects received blinatumomab and 84 (72%; 84/116) subjects completed 1 cycle of 
treatment. In the core study, the median treatment exposure was 55 days (range: 1 to 113 days). 
Per the protocol, subjects were considered to have discontinued treatment in cycle 1 if they planned to 
receive HSCT, prior to cycle 4 if they had not planned to receive HSCT after blinatumomab therapy, or 
due to adverse events. Overall, 28% (33/116) of subjects discontinued treatment. Of those 33 subjects, 
20 (17%; 20/116) subjects discontinued treatment as a result of an adverse event.  
The subject incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events that led to treatment interruption was 31% 
(36/116).

Adverse events  
A summary of the subject incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) is presented. The 
subject incidence of AE was 100.0%; 62.9% of subjects experienced SAE. The subject incidence of TEAE 
was 96.6%; 51.7% of subjects experienced treatment-related SAE. AEs leading to interruption and 
permanent discontinuation of blinatumomab were reported for 31.0% and 17.2% of subjects, 
respectively. Grade 3 or higher AEs were reported for 61.2% of subjects; 51.7% of subjects experienced 
a treatment-related Grade 3 or higher AE. Two subjects (1.7%) experienced fatal AE; 1 was considered 
treatment-related. 
A summary of the subject incidence of TEAE by disease history, by baseline MRD level are presented in 
following tables.

Treatment-emergent Adverse Events 
All 116 subjects (100%) in the FAS experienced at least 1 TEAE. Of the 116 subjects, 74 subjects 
received CTM4, 40 subjects received CTM5, and 2 subjects received both CTM4 and CTM5. There was no 
difference in the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events between subjects treated with CTM4 
and CTM5. The highest incidences (≥ 50%) of TEAE by system organ class (SOC) were General Disorders 
and Administration Site Conditions (94.8%; 110/116), Nervous System Disorders (68.1%; 79/116), and 
Gastrointestinal Disorders (53.4%; 62/116). The most frequently reported TEAEs (preferred terms in >

20% of subjects) were pyrexia (88.8%; 103/116), headache (37.9%; 44/116), tremor (30.2%; 35/116), 
chills (25.9%; 30/116), fatigue (24.1%; 28/116), nausea (23.3%; 27/116), and vomiting (22.4%; 
26/116).  
Of the most frequently reported events described above, all occurred at a higher incidence in cycle 1 
versus cycles 2, 3, or 4. Pyrexia (88.8%), headache (37.9%), tremor, chills, and diarrhea were reported 
at a higher incidence for subjects who relapsed once compared to subjects who had not relapsed. TEAEs 
of grade ≥ 3, grade ≥ 4, and fatal (grade 5) were 61.2% (71/116), 28.4% (33/116), and 1.7% (2/116), 
respectively. Grade 5 events (preferred terms) included atypical pneumonia and subdural haemorrhage. 
(Sepsis after allogeneic HSCT [considered unrelated to study treatment by the investigator] was reported 
as a grade 5 treatment-emergent event in the primary analysis report, but was no longer classified as an 
adverse event because it was reported after the End-of-Study visit).  
Treatment-emergent grade ≥ 3 adverse events (preferred term in ≥ 5% of subjects) included neutropenia 
(15.5%; 18/116), pyrexia (7.8%; 9/116), leukopenia (6%; 7/116), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
increased and tremor (5.2%; 6/116 for each). Among the most frequently reported treatment emergent 
grade ≥ 3 adverse events, there was no trend toward increased subject incidence of events of pyrexia, 
neutropenia, or leukopenia across treatment cycles; grade ≥ 3 ALT increased and tremor were only 
reported in cycle 1 at an incidence of 5.2% (6/116 for each). The subject incidences of grade ≥ 3, grade 
≥ 4, and fatal events were similar between subjects in first remission compared to subjects in second 
remission. 
Treatment-related treatment-emergent Adverse Events 
TEAEs considered related to blinatumomab by the investigator were reported for 96.6% (112/116) of 
subjects. Treatment-related TEAE (preferred terms in > 10% of subjects) were pyrexia (83.6%; 97/116), 
tremor (27.6%; 32/116), headache (25%; 29/116), chills (23.3%; 27/116), fatigue (18.1%, 21/116), 
nausea (16.4%, 19/116), neutropenia (13.8% 16/116), aphasia (12.1%, 14/116), vomiting (11.2%, 
13/116) and hypotension (10.3%, 12/116), with similar incidence for subjects who were treated in C1, 
C2 or C3. Treatment-related TEAEs of grade ≥ 3, grade ≥ 4, and grade 5 were 51.7% (60/116), 22.4%

(26/116), and 0.9% (1/116), respectively. One subject experienced treatment-related treatment-
emergent grade 5 atypical pneumonia.  
Treatment Interruptions Due to Adverse Events 
The subject incidence of TEAE that led to interruption of treatment was 31.0% (36/116). Of these 36 
subjects, events were considered serious for 28 subjects (24.1%; 28/116). By SOC, general disorders 
and administration site conditions (11.2%), nervous system disorders (10.3%), Injury, poisoning and 
procedural complications (6.0%) and investigations (5.2%) led frequently (>5%) to treatment 
interruption. TEAEs (preferred terms in ≥ 2% of subjects) that led to treatment interruption were pyrexia 
(7.8%; 9/116), aphasia, encephalopathy, overdose, and tremor (3.4%; 4/116 for each), and ALT 
increased, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased, and chills (2.6%; 3/116 for each). No TEAE that 
led to interruption of treatment were fatal.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The subject incidence of TEAE that led to permanent discontinuation of blinatumomab was 17.2% 
(20/116). Of these 20 subjects, 15 subjects (12.9%; 15/116) experienced SAEs that led to permanent 
discontinuation treatment. Eleven subjects (9.5%; 11/116) had neurologic TEAE that led to permanent

discontinuation of blinatumomab. Nervous system disorders was the SOC leading to the most treatment 
discontinuation. TEAEs (preferred terms in ≥ 2% of subjects) that led to permanent treatment 
discontinuation were tremor (4.3%; 5/116), and aphasia, encephalopathy, and seizure (2.6%; 3/116 for 
each).

Serious adverse events 
In the FAS, the subject incidence of treatment-emergent SAEs was 62.9% (73/116). Treatment-emergent 
serious adverse events (preferred terms in ≥ 5% of subjects) were pyrexia (14.7%; 17/116), tremor 
(6.9%; 8/116), aphasia and encephalopathy (5.2%; 6/116 for each). The subject incidence of treatment-
emergent serious adverse events was similar regardless of remission status. 
The subject incidence of treatment-emergent serious adverse events considered related to blinatumomab 
by the investigator was 51.7% (60/116). It was slightly higher for subjects in second remission (59.0%; 
23/39) compared to subjects in first remission (46.7%; 35/75). 
In the adult MRD-positive ALL population (n=137), SAEs were reported for 60.6% of subjects, which was 
consistent with the adult R/R Ph-negative ALL population (63.4%). For the adult MRD-positive ALL 
population, the most frequently reported SAE was pyrexia, reported for 12.4% of subjects compared with 
6.4% for the adult R/R Ph- ALL population. Serious tremor, also reported for ≥ 5% of the adult MRD-

positive ALL population (5.8%), was reported for 1.7% of the adult relapsed/refractory Philadelphia 
chromosome-negative ALL. Serious febrile neutropenia was reported less frequently in the adult MRD-
positive ALL population than in the adult R/R Ph- (1.5% vs 8.5%). 
Deaths 
Table 40: Deaths and cause of death 
A total of 1.7% (2/116) of subjects died as a result of an adverse event that occurred within 30 days of 
their last treatment of blinatumomab. Fatal TEAEs were atypical pneumonia and subdural hemorrhage, 
occurring in 1 subject each. The event of atypical pneumonia was considered related to blinatumomab. Of 
the 2 subjects who died, 1 subject was in first remission and 1 subject was in his second remission. 
Adverse events of special interest 
Events of interest (EOI) for the blinatumomab program include neurologic events, infections, CRS, drug 
related hepatic disorders, infusion reactions, tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), thromboembolic events, 
medication errors, cytopenias, decreased immunoglobulins, capillary leak syndrome (CLS), pancreatitis 
and leukoencephalopathy (including progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy [PML]). 
Overall, treatment-emergent EOIs were identified for 95.7% (111/116) of subjects. Serious treatment-
emergent EOIs were identified for 45.7% (53/116) of subjects. The subject incidences of grade ≥ 3 
(severe), grade ≥ 4 (life-threatening), and grade 5 (fatal) treatment-emergent EOIs were 52.6% 
(61/116), 27.6% (32/116), and 0.9% (1/116), respectively. 
Treatment-related treatment-emergent EOIs were identified for 91.4% (106/116) of subjects. Serious 
treatment-related treatment-emergent EOIs were identified for 39.7% (46/116) of subjects. The subject 
incidences of grade ≥ 3, grade ≥ 4, and fatal treatment-related treatment-emergent EOIs were 45.7% 
(53/116), 21.6% (25/116), and 0.9% (1/116), respectively (Table 12-5).

subjects, including (preferred terms in > 2 subjects) tremor (6.9%; 8/116), aphasia and encephalopathy 
(5.2%; 6/116 for each), and seizure (2.6%; 3/116). Neurologic events (preferred terms in > 2 subjects) 
that led to permanent discontinuation of treatment included tremor (4.3%; 5/116), and aphasia, 
encephalopathy, and seizure (2.6%; 3/116 for each). Neurologic events (preferred terms in > 2 subjects) 
that led to treatment interruption included aphasia, encephalopathy, and tremor (3.4%; 4/116 for each). 
The subject incidences of grade ≥ 3 and grade 4 neurologic events were 12.1% (14/116) and 2.6% 
(3/116), respectively. No fatal neurologic events were identified.  
Of the 61 subjects identified as having a neurologic event, 55 subjects (47.4%; 55/116) were identified 
as having events considered related to blinatumomab by the investigator. Serious related neurologic 
events were identified for 21.6% (25/116) of subjects. The subject incidences of treatment-related grade 
≥ 3 and grade 4 neurologic events were 12.1% (14/116) and 2.6% (3/116), respectively.

As compared the adult MRD-positive ALL population (n=137) to the adult R/R ALL population, neurologic 
events  (preferred  terms)  were  generally  more  frequently  reported  in  the  adult  MRD-positive  ALL 
population (≥ 10% of subjects) than in the adult R/R Ph- ALL population: headache (39.4% vs 32.6%), 
tremor (29.2% vs 14.2%), insomnia (16.1% vs 11.6%), aphasia (11.7% vs 3.2%), and dizziness (10.2% 
vs  9.8%).  Permanent  discontinuation  by  nervous  system  disorders  (SOC  9.5%  vs  3.4%)  was  more 
frequently  reported  in  MRD+  population  than  in  R/R  ALL  population:  tremor  (3.6%  ),  seizure  (2.9%), 
encephalopathy (2.2%) and aphasia (2.2%) in the adult MRD-positive ALL population versus ≤ 1.3% for 
each in the adult R/R Ph- ALL populations. 
In the adult MRD-positive ALL population (n=137), the median time to first onset of neurologic events 
was shorter for the R/R Ph- ALL populations (2.0 days vs 6.0 days), as well as the median time to first 
grade ≥ 3 neurologic event (4.0 days vs 17.0 days). The median duration of neurologic events (KM) was 
shorter (10.0 days; 95% CI: 6.0, 15.0) than in the adult R/R Ph- ALL population (19.0 days; 95% CI: 
13.0, 29.0). The subject incidence of neurologic events that persisted for > 14 days was similar across 
the 2 ALL populations (41.7%, 47.9%). 
Leukoencephalopathy 
Grade 2 leukoencephalopathy was identified for 1 subject (Subject 1002-003; 0.9%; 1/116). This subject 
was in the first remission. The event occurred during cycle 1, and was considered serious and related to 
blinatumomab. Treatment was permanently discontinued. The time to onset of the leukoencephalopathy 
event was 17.0 days for the 1 subject in adult MRD-positive ALL population. The median time to onset of 
the first event was 24.0 days (range: 13 to 401 days) for the 4 subjects in the adult relapsed or 
refractory Philadelphia chromosome-negative ALL population, and 23.0 days (range: 9 to 401 days) for 
the 7 subjects in the total relapsed or refractory ALL population with leukoencephalopathy events 
Infections 
In the FAS, 41.4% (48/116) of subjects were identified as having an infection. The most frequently 
identified infection events (preferred terms in ≥ 5% of subjects) were device related infection and 
nasopharyngitis (6.9%; 8/116 for each), and upper respiratory tract infection (5.2%; 6/116). Serious 
infection events were identified for 12.9% (15/116) of subjects. Serious infections (preferred terms in > 2 
subjects) included device-related infection and staphylococcal infection (2.6%; 3/116 each). Infection 
events (preferred terms) that led to permanent discontinuation of treatment included atypical pneumonia 
and catheter site infection (0.9%; 1/116 for each). Infection events (preferred terms) that led to 
interruption of treatment included bacterial infection and device related infection (0.9%, 1/116 for each). 
Subject incidences of grade ≥ 3 and grade ≥ 4 infection events were 10.3% (12/116) and 3.4% (4/116) 
respectively. One subject (0.9%; 1/116) experienced a fatal infection (preferred term: atypical 
pneumonia). 
Of the 48 subjects who were identified as having infection events, 9 subjects (7.8%; 9/116) experienced 
events that were considered related to blinatumomab by the investigator. Serious treatment-related 
infection events were identified for 4.3% (5/116) of subjects. The subject incidence of related grade ≥ 3 
infection events was 2.6% (3/116). One subject (0.9%; 1/116) experienced a fatal infection (preferred 
term: atypical pneumonia) event that was considered related to treatment by the investigator. 
Cytokine Release Syndrome 
The subject incidence of events coded as CRS was 3.4% (4/116). All events occurred in treatment cycle 
1. All events were coded as CRS; no event was coded as cytokine storm. Two subjects (1.7%, 2/116) 
experienced a serious CRS event. The subject incidence of grade 3 CRS was 1.7% (2/116). No grade ? 4 
CRS events were identified. All serious and grade 3 treatment-related CRS were considered related to 
blinatumomab treatment. One subject (0.9%, 1/116) experienced a CRS event leading to treatment 
interruption; no adverse events led to treatment discontinuations.

Using the broad search strategy, events suggestive of CRS were identified for 87.1% (101/116) of 
subjects. The most frequently identified events suggestive of CRS (preferred terms in ≥ 5% of subjects) 
were pyrexia (68.1%; 79/116), chills (20.7%; 24/116), headache (15.5%; 18/116), vomiting (12.9%; 
15/116), nausea and hypotension (8.6%; 10/116 for each). 
Drug Related Hepatic Disorders 
The subject incidence of events that may be suggestive of drug related hepatic disorders was 14.7% 
(17/116). The most frequently identified drug related hepatic disorders (preferred terms in ≥ 2% of 
subjects) were ALT increased (6%; 7/116), AST increased (4.3%; 5/116), and prothrombin time 
prolonged (2.6%; 3/116). Serious drug related hepatic disorders were identified for 6% (7/116) of 
subjects and included hepatotoxicity, prothrombin time prolonged, blood bilirubin increased, hepatic 
enzyme increased, liver function test abnormal (0.9%, 1/116 for each); and ALT increased and AST 
increased (1.7%, 2/116 for each). Drug related hepatic disorder events (preferred terms) that led to 
permanent discontinuation of treatment included hepatic enzymes increased (0.9%; 1/116). Events 
(preferred terms in > 2 subjects) that led to treatment interruption included ALT increased and AST 
increased (2.6%; 3/116 for each). The subject incidences of grade ? 3 (severe) and grade 4 (life-
threatening) drug related hepatic disorders were 8.6% (10/116) and 6% (7/116), respectively. Grade 4 
events included ALT increased (4.3%, 4/116), AST increased (2.6%, 3/116), hepatic enzyme increased 
(1.7%, 2/116), and hepatotoxicity (0.9%, 1/116). No fatal drug related hepatic disorders were identified. 
Of the 17 subjects who were identified as having drug related hepatic disorders, 13 subjects (11.2%; 
13/116) were identified as having events that were considered related to blinatumomab. The subject 
incidence of serious treatment-related drug related hepatic disorders was 5.2% (6/116). All grade ≥ 3 
events were considered related to blinatumomab. 
Infusion Reactions 
Signs and symptoms suggestive of infusion reactions were identified in 86.2% (100/116) of subjects. The 
most frequently reported events (preferred terms in ≥ 5% of subjects) that may be associated with 
infusion reactions were pyrexia (68.1%; 79/116), chills (20.7%; 24/116), headache (15.5%; 18/116), 
vomiting (12.9%; 15/116), and hypotension and nausea (8.6%; 10/116 for each). Serious infusion 
reaction events were identified for 5.2% (6/116). The subject incidences of grade ≥ 3 and grade 4 
infusion reaction events were 8.6% (10/116) and 1.7% (2/116), respectively. No fatal infusion reaction 
events were identified. Of the 100 subjects who were identified as having infusion reaction events, 92 
subjects (79.3%; 92/116) were identified as having events were considered related to blinatumomab. All 
serious and grade ≥3 and grade 4 infusion reaction events were considered related to blinatumomab 
treatment. 
As compared the adult MRD-positive ALL population (n=137) to the adult R/R ALL population, infusion 
reaction events were reported for 90.5% of subjects including 13.9% serious infusion events, which were 
both higher than in the adult R/R Ph- ALL population (50.8% and 2.5% serious). Grade ≥ 3 and grade ≥ 
4 events, respectively, were reported for 10.2% and 0.7% in the adult MRD-positive ALL population, 
which was generally consistent with other populations. No fatal infusion reaction events were reported. In 
the adult MRD-positive ALL population, two most frequently reported infusion reaction events was pyrexia 
(85.4%) and hypotension (12.4%), both of these were higher than in the adult R/R Ph- ALL 
population(pyrexia 40.0%, hypotension <5%).  
The median time to onset of the first infusion reaction event was 1.0 days (range: 1 to 87 days) for the 
adult MRD-positive ALL population and 2.0 days (range: 1 to 190 days) for the adult R/R ALL populations. 
Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
Assessment report  
EMA/847661/2018 
Page 89/125 
 
  
  
 
Tumor lysis syndrome describes a combination of metabolic abnormalities that occur due to the release of 
nuclear and cytoplasmic degradation products of malignant cells. Characteristic findings of TLS include 
hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia. High tumor burden is an important 
risk factor for TLS, and therefore these events are unlikely in subjects in hematologic remission. 
There were no subjects that experienced an adverse event coded as the preferred term of TLS. The 
subject incidence of adverse events with coded preferred terms retrieved from the TLS broad search 
strategy was 6.9% (8/116), and included adverse events of cytokine release syndrome (3.4%, 4/116), 
hypocalcemia (1.7%, 2/116), and hyperkalemia and oliguria (0.9%, 1/116 for each). Of these events, 2 
were considered serious (both with preferred term cytokine release syndrome) and 2 events were grade 3 
in severity; no fatal TLS events were identified. 
Thromboembolic Events 
In the FAS, 4.3% (5/116) of subjects experienced signs and symptoms suggestive of thromboembolic 
events, including (preferred terms):  thrombosis in device (1.7%; 2/116) and device occlusion, 
thrombosis, and vena cava thrombosis (0.9%; 1/116 for each). No events of disseminated intravascular 
coagulation (DIC) were identified. Serious thromboembolic events were identified for 2.6% (3/116) of 
subjects including thrombosis, thrombosis in device, and vena cava thrombosis (0.9%; 1/116 for each). 
Thromboembolic events (preferred terms) that led to permanent discontinuation of treatment included 
thrombosis and vena cava thrombosis (0.9%; 1/116 for each) (Table 14-6.7); no thromboembolic events 
led to treatment interruption. The subject incidences of ≥ grade 3 and grade 4 thromboembolic events 
were 3.4% (4/116) and 1.7% (2/116), respectively; grade 4 events included thrombosis and thrombosis 
in device (0.9%, 1/116 for each). No fatal thromboembolic events were identified. No thromboembolic 
events were considered related to blinatumomab. 
Medication Errors 
Variations in dosing that fell within < 10% of the intended dose were not considered overdoses and were 
excluded. Overdoses were to be reported as serious events for this study, including overdose with or 
without associated adverse events. An overdose was always reported as serious adverse regardless of 
outcome. 
Medication error events were identified for 5.2% (6/116) of subjects. Events in 5 subjects (4.3%, 5/116) 
were coded as overdose, and in 1 subject (0.9%) as accidental overdose (preferred term), and therefore, 
considered serious. No medication error events were grade ≥ 3. Of the 6 subjects who were identified as 
having medication error events, 4 subjects (3.4%; 4/116) were identified as having events that were 
considered related to blinatumomab (2.6% [3/116] as overdose and 0.9% [1/116, 1/116]) as accidental 
overdose). Medication errors led to treatment interruption for 5 subjects (4.3%; 5/116). No subjects 
permanently discontinued treatment as a result of a medication error. 
Cytopenias (including febrile neutropenia and neutropenia) 
In the FAS, 27.6% (32/116) of subjects were identified cytopenias by laboratory testing. The most 
frequently identified cytopenia events (preferred terms ≥ 5% of subjects) were neutropenia (15.5%; 
18/116) including, leukopenia (6.9%; 8/116), anemia (6.0%, 7/116), and thrombocytopenia (5.2%; 
6/116). Serious cytopenia events were identified for 6.9% (8/116) of subjects. Serious cytopenia events 
(preferred terms in > 2 subjects) included neutropenia (4.3%; 5/116). No subjects permanently 
discontinued treatment as a result of cytopenias. Cytopenias leading to treatment interruption included 
leukopenia and thrombocytopenia (0.9%, 1/116 for each). The subject incidences of grade ≥ 3 and grade 
4 cytopenia events were 25% (29/116) and 17.2% (20/116), respectively. No fatal cytopenia events 
were identified. Of the 32 subjects who were identified as having cytopenia events, 25 subjects (21.6%; 
25/116) were identified as having events were considered related to blinatumomab. Serious treatment-

related events were identified for 4.3% (5/116) of subjects. The subject incidences of grade ≥ 3 and 
grade 4 treatment-related events were 19.8% (23/116) and 13.8% (16/116), respectively.  
Febrile neutropenia was reported in 3 subjects (2.6%), 2 (1.7%) of them were serious. 
Decreased Immunoglobulins 
Decreased immunoglobulin levels were identified for 6.9% (8/116) of subjects. The following events 
(preferred terms) were identified: blood immunoglobulin G (IgG) decreased (5.2%; 6/116), and 
hypogammaglobulinemia and immunoglobulins decreased (0.9%; 1/116 for each). No serious treatment-
emergent events or adverse events that led to treatment discontinuation or interruption were identified. 
The subject incidence of grade 3 events was 1.7% (2/116). No grade 4 or fatal decreased 
immunoglobulin levels were identified. All events were considered related to blinatumomab. 
Capillary Leak Syndrome 
Capillary leak syndrome comprises a set of signs and symptoms such as edema, hypoalbuminemia, and 
hypotension, which can occur at any time while on treatment in patients with hematologic malignancies 
and may be a manifestation of CRS. The subject incidence of events suggestive of CLS was 16.4% 
(19/116). The following events (preferred terms) that were suggestive of CLS were identified: 
hypotension (12.1%; 14/116), edema peripheral (2.6%; 3/116), blood albumin decreased, 
hypoalbuminaemia, and CLS (0.9%; 1/116 for each). One subject (0.9%; 1/116) was identified as having 
a serious CLS event (preferred term: hypotension). No subjects permanently discontinued treatment as a 
result of CLS events. Subjects with events suggestive of CLS who had an interruption of treatment 
included hypotension (1.7%, 2/116). The subject incidences of grade ≥ 3 and grade 4 CLS events were 
1.7% (2/116) and 0.9% (1/116), respectively. No fatal CLS events were identified. Of the 19 subjects 
who were identified as having experienced events suggestive of CLS, 14 subjects (12.1%; 14/116) were 
identified as having events were considered related to blinatumomab. One subject each (0.9%; 1/116 for 
each) experienced a treatment-related event that was serious and grade 4 in severity. 
Pancreatitis 
For the adult MRD-positive ALL population (n=137), pancreatitis (preferred term) was reported for 1 
(0.7%) subject (non-serious), which was consistent with all other ALL populations (< 0.5%; ≤ 0.2% 
serious). Grade ≥ 3 events were reported for 2 (0.4%) subjects in the adult relapsed or refractory 
Philadelphia chromosome-negative ALL population. No grade ≥ 4 or fatal events of pancreatitis were 
reported. 
Laboratory findings 
For the adult MRD-positive ALL population (n=137), few changes from baseline of ≥ 3 toxicity grades 
were reported; most were hematologic laboratory parameters. Changes from baseline of ≥ 3 toxicity 
grades reported for > 2.0% of subjects in the adult MRD-positive ALL population were absolute 
lymphocytes decreased (8.0%), WBC count decreased (5.1%), absolute neutrophils granulocytes 
decreased (4.4%), ALT increased, absolute neutrophils decreased (3.6% each), platelet count decreased 
(2.9%), and AST increased (2.2%). The percentage of subjects with changes from baseline of ≥ 3 toxicity 
grades in the adult MRD-positive ALL population was consistent with the adult relapsed/refractory 
Philadelphia chromosome-negative ALL and the total relapsed/refractory ALL population. 
Hemoglobin 
Grade 3 hemoglobin values are defined as 65 to < 80 g/L, and grade 4 hemoglobin values are not defined 
(considered life-threatening). In the FAS, the baseline median hemoglobin concentration was 113.0 g/L 
(range: 86 to 161 g/L). There was a trend toward increasing median hemoglobin concentrations starting 
at day 8 of cycle 1 and continued to be above the median baseline value throughout the core study. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/847661/2018 
Page 91/125 
 
  
  
following maximum shifts from grade < 3 to grade ≥ 3 occurred during the core study: 2 subjects (1.7%; 
2/116) had a shift from grade 1 to grade 3; and 4 subjects (3.4%; 4/116) had a shift from grade 2 to 
grade 3. During the core study, no subjects had hemoglobin decreased and 6.0% (7/116) had anemia 
(preferred terms). 
Platelet Count 
Grade 3 platelet values are defined as 25 to < 50 x 109/L, and grade 4 platelet values are defined as < 
25 x 109/L. In the FAS, the baseline median platelet counts were 170.0 x 109/L (range: 18.0 to 436.0 x 
109/L). An initial decrease in platelet counts was observed during cycle 1 from days 2 and 3; however, 
median platelet concentrations returned toward the baseline concentration on day 8 of cycle 1 and did not 
change appreciably to the end of the core study. During the core study, 1.7% (2/116) of subjects had 
platelet counts decreased and 5.2% (6/116) of subjects had thrombocytopenia (preferred terms). 
White Blood Cell Count 
Grade 3 WBC counts (leukocytes) are defined as 1.0 to < 2.0 x 109/L, and grade 4 WBC values are 
defined as < 1.0 x 109/L. In the FAS, the baseline median WBC counts were 4.3 x 109/L (range: 1.2 to 
15.7 x 109/L). Increases in median WBC counts were observed on day 2 of each treatment cycle, 
consistent with corticosteroid premedication; however, median WBC counts returned toward baseline by 
the end of each cycle during the core study. During the core study, 2.6% (3/116) of subjects had WBC 
decreased, 1.7% (2/116) had lymphopenia, 6.9% (8/116) had leukopenia, and 15.5% (18/116) had 
neutropenia (preferred term). 
Electrocardiograms 
Standard 12-lead ECGs were performed at screening and at the end of core study. A subset of subjects 
(N = 27) at selected sites in Germany had additional ECG assessment. These additional ECGs were 
performed in triplicate and analyzed by a central vendor. The mean (SD) baseline QTcF was 406.37 
(22.04) msec and the maximum post baseline mean (SD) QTcF interval was 416.44 (16.42) msec. The 
mean (SD) maximum increase in the QTcF was 14.64 (8.99) msec. Two subjects (1.7%; 2/116; Subject 
1002-005 and Subject 1018-003) had maximum increases from baseline > 30 to 60 msecs. For both of 
these subjects, QT prolongation was detected within 2 days of starting treatment. Neither of these 
subjects had a history of cardiac disorders, nor did they have an adverse event temporally associated 
with QT prolongation. No increase > 60 msecs or maximum values > 500 msec were reported. Seven 
subjects (6%; 7/116) had maximum increases from baseline > 30 to 60 msecs. No increase > 60 msecs 
or maximum values > 500 msec were reported. 
Hospitalizations 
In the FAS, the median total duration of hospitalization was 14.0 days (range: 3 to 63 days). The median 
duration of hospitalization was 6 days for cycle 1, 4 days for cycles 2 and 3, and 3 days for cycle 4. In the 
FAS, 70.7% (82/116) of subjects had prolonged hospitalizations. Of these 82 subjects, 51 subjects (44%; 
51/116) had prolonged hospitalization as a result of adverse events and 39 subjects (33.6%; 39/116) 
had prolonged hospitalizations as a result of other reasons. The subject incidence of prolonged 
hospitalizations decreased with increasing number of cycles. 
Immunogenicity Data 
Anti-blinatumomab binding antibody was evaluated with a validated blinatumomab anti-drug antibody 
assay with the electrochemiluminescence detection technology. For samples considered to be “potentially 
positive” were further re-analyzed. A total of 106 subjects dosed in the study had paired blood serum 
samples (predose and postdose) and were evaluated for anti-blinatumomab antibodies. All enrolled 
patients who received blinatumomab treatment were classified as negative for the presence of anti 
blinatumomab antibodies at end of study. Thus, the immunogenicity rate for this clinical study was 0%.

Safety in special populations 
Adverse events were not analysed by subgroups for the pivotal Study MT103-203 or the supportive Study

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No formal drug interaction studies have been conducted with blinatumomab. 
Post marketing experience 
From the International Birth Date of 03 December 2014 to 02 December 2016 (data lock point for 
Periodic Benefit-risk Evaluation Report/Periodic Safety Update Report [PBRER/PSUR] #2), an estimated 
2236 patients had been exposed to blinatumomab in the marketed setting.  
As of 02 December 2016, Amgen received, cumulatively, a total of 1786 serious adverse drug reactions 
(ADRs) in the post-marketing setting, from spontaneous and solicited sources. In addition, 808 non 
serious ADRs were reported spontaneously.  
Overall, among the 1786 total serious ADRs reported from spontaneous and solicited sources, the most 
frequently reported adverse reactions (≥ 10%) were from the system organ classes of Nervous System 
Disorders (17.1%), General Disorders and Administrative Site Conditions (17.0%), and Investigations 
(11.0%). Serious adverse reactions with an event incidence ≥ 1% were pyrexia (5.5%); cytokine release 
syndrome (5.0%); neurotoxicity (4.5%); death (3.9%); ALL recurrent and neutropenia (2.4% each); 
blast cell count increased (1.9%); hospitalization (1.7%); seizure and febrile neutropenia (1.5% each); 
ALL (1.4%); confusional state (1.3%); sepsis, disease progression, hypotension, and platelet count 
decreased (1.2% each); and headache (1.0%). These events are consistent with the known safety profile 
of blinatumomab or representative of the underlying malignancy.  
Overall, the safety information received in the post marketing setting was consistent with the established 
safety profile and cumulative experience of blinatumomab. The overall benefit-risk profile of 
blinatumomab remains favorable in the approved indication.  
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
A total of 843 subjects from 8 clinical studies received blinatumomab, including 706 subjects with 
relapsed/refractory ALL from 6 clinical studies and 137 subjects in the adult MRD-positive ALL population 
from 2 clinical studies. In support of the present variation in MRD, the safety of blinatumomab is based 
on data  a pivotal, phase 2, open-label, single-arm study (MT103-203) in adult subjects with MRD-
positive B-cell precursor ALL (N = 116) and a supportive study phase 2, open-label, single-arm study 
(MT103-202) in adult subjects with MRD-positive B-cell precursor ALL (N = 21).  
The specific safety profile of blinatumomab (causality) is difficult to assess in a clinical relevant way 
because on the one hand there is a high risk of investigator’s bias in the judgment of treatment-related 
TEAE due to open-label design, and on the other hand the majority of toxicities (eg general disorders, 
haematological and gastrointestinal toxicities, infections and infestations, etc) are commonly related to 
underlying malignancy, disease burden or prior anti-tumor therapy. 
Considering that notable differences exist between pivotal and supportive MRD studies (concomitant use 
of TKI and different posology in supportive study) and that the supportive study (n=21) is too small, the 
assessment of the safety profile of Blincyto in MRD-positive ALL is primarily focused on data from the 
pivotal study MT103-203. BSA-based dosing (15µg/m2/day) was used in pivotal and supportive studies in 
MRD, while a fixed dosing (28µg/day) was proposed in SmPC. The switch from BSA-based dosing to fixed 
Assessment report  
EMA/847661/2018 
Page 93/125 
 
  
  
 
dosing had been justified by population PK analysis based on an integrated dataset of 8 studies, and is 
considered acceptable for patients with a weight of at least 45 kg.  
The key difference between the adult MRD-positive ALL population and the other populations examined 
was the requirement for subjects in MRD studies to be in hematologic remission at baseline. This 
difference was reflected in baseline laboratory values where platelet count, neutrophil count, and WBC 
count were generally more favorable for the adult MRD-positive ALL population than for other 
populations. Furthermore, none of the subjects in the adult MRD-positive ALL population had bone 
marrow blasts based on central and local laboratory assessments at baseline. Across all other populations 
and in the pooled ALL population, at least 54% of subjects had ≥ 50% bone marrow blasts based on 
central and local laboratory assessments at baseline. The overall subject incidences of adverse events 
were similar across the adult MRD-positive and R/R ALL populations examined (> 99%). 
Blincyto was used as monotherapy at a dose of 15µg/m2/day at a constant flow rate over 28 days per 
treatment cycle followed by an infusion-free period of 14 days. Patients could receive up to 4 cycles 
regardless of whether or not MRD response was achieved at the end of C1. Per protocol, subjects were 
considered to have discontinued treatment in cycle 1 if they planned to receive HSCT, prior to cycle 4 if 
they had not planned to receive HSCT after blinatumomab therapy, or due to adverse events. Overall, 
28% (33/116) of subjects discontinued treatment. Of those 33 subjects, 20 (17%; 20/116) subjects 
discontinued treatment as a result of an adverse event.  
The subject incidence of AE was 100.0%; 62.9% of subjects experienced SAE. The subject incidence of 
TEAE was 96.6%; 51.7% of subjects experienced treatment-related SAE. AEs leading to interruption and 
permanent discontinuation of blinatumomab were reported for 31.0% and 17.2% of subjects, 
respectively. Grade 3 or higher AEs were reported for 61.2% of subjects; 51.7% of subjects experienced 
a treatment-related Grade 3 or higher AE. Two subjects (1.7%) experienced fatal AE; 1 was considered 
treatment-related.   
The safety profile of Blincyto in subjects in CR1 was not notably different from that of subjects in 
CR2/CR3. The analyses of TEAE by baseline MRD level suggest a better tolerance of Blincyto in subjects 
with baseline MRD <10-3 as compared to >10-3 (SAE 37.5% vs 64.8%, TEAE leading to discontinuation: 
12.5% vs 20.4%). However, due to too small subgroup size and the absence of comparator group, no 
clear conclusion can be drawn in this small single-arm study. 
For Study MT103-203, the highest incidences (≥ 50%) of TEAE by system organ class (SOC) were General 
Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (94.8%; 110/116), Nervous System Disorders (68.1%; 
79/116), and Gastrointestinal Disorders (53.4%; 62/116). The most frequently reported TEAEs (preferred 
terms in > 20% of subjects) were pyrexia (88.8%; 103/116), headache (37.9%; 44/116), tremor 
(30.2%; 35/116), chills (25.9%; 30/116), fatigue (24.1%; 28/116), nausea (23.3%; 27/116), and 
vomiting (22.4%; 26/116).  
Treatment-emergent grade ≥ 3 adverse events (preferred term in ≥ 5% of subjects) included neutropenia 
(15.5%; 18/116), pyrexia (7.8%; 9/116), leukopenia (6%; 7/116), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
increased and tremor (5.2%; 6/116 for each). 
The subject incidence of TEAE that led to interruption of treatment was 31.0% (36/116). Of these 36 
subjects, events were considered serious for 28 subjects (24.1%; 28/116). Nervous system disorders 
(10.3%) such as encephalopathy, tremor, aphasia leading to interruption of blinatumomab were more 
frequently reported for the MRD-positive ALL population than for R/R Ph- ALL population (<2%). The 
subject incidence of TEAE that led to permanent discontinuation of blinatumomab was 17.2% (20/116). 
Of these 20 subjects, 15 subjects (12.9%; 15/116) experienced SAEs that led to permanent 
discontinuation treatment. Eleven subjects (9.5%; 11/116) had neurologic TEAE that led to permanent

discontinuation of blinatumomab. Nervous system disorders leading to permanent discontinuation was 
more frequently reported in MRD+ population than in R/R ALL population (9.5% vs 3.4%).  
The most frequently reported adverse events leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug (17.2%) 
in the adult MRD-positive ALL population were tremor (3.6%); seizure (2.9%); and encephalopathy and 
aphasia (2.2%), which were each reported for ≤ 1.3% of subjects in the adult R/R Ph- ALL populations.  
In the FAS, the subject incidence of treatment-emergent SAEs was 62.9% (73/116). Treatment-emergent 
serious adverse events (preferred terms in ≥ 5% of subjects) were pyrexia (14.7%; 17/116), tremor 
(6.9%; 8/116), aphasia and encephalopathy (5.2%; 6/116 for each). Serious pyrexia and tremor were 
more frequently reported in the adult MRD-positive ALL population than for adult R/R Ph- ALL (1.7%). 
A total of 53 deaths (45.7%, 53/116) were reported in the study. Of these, 23 deaths (19.8%, 23/116) 
occurred while the subjects were in CR after HSCT (out of a total of 90 subjects who received HSCT after 
starting blinatumomab , 3 deaths (2.6%, 3/116) occurred while subjects were in CR without receiving 
HSCT (out of a total of 26 subjects who did not receive HSCT, and deaths after relapse without HSCT, 
pre-HSCT, and post-HSCT were reported in 9 subjects each (7.8%, 9/116 each). A total of 1.7% (2/116) 
of subjects died as a result of an adverse event that occurred within 30 days of their last treatment of 
blinatumomab. Fatal TEAEs were atypical pneumonia and subdural hemorrhage, occurring in 1 subject 
each. The event of atypical pneumonia was considered related to blinatumomab. Consistent with the 
nature and severity of the background diseases, the subject incidence of fatal adverse events in the adult 
MRD-positive ALL population (1.5%) was lower than in all other ALL populations (> 10% of subjects).   
Events of interest (EOI) for the blinatumomab program include neurologic events, infections, CRS, drug 
related hepatic disorders, infusion reactions, tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), thromboembolic events, 
medication errors, cytopenias, decreased immunoglobulins, capillary leak syndrome (CLS), pancreatitis 
and leukoencephalopathy (including progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy [PML]). All these events 
are already included in the current SmPC in the sections covering posology, warning and precautions for 
use, effects on ability to drive and use machine, and ADR. These EOI are also included in the RMP. 
Pancreatitis, one of recently added EOI, was also reported in MRD+ trials.   
52.6% (61/116) of subjects were identified as having neurologic events. The most frequently identified 
neurologic events were tremor (30.2%), aphasia (12.9%), dizziness (7.8%), ataxia and paraesthesia (6% 
for each), and encephalopathy (5.2%). Serious treatment-emergent neurologic events were identified for 
21.6% of subjects, including tremor (6.9%), aphasia and encephalopathy (5.2% for each), and seizure 
(2.6%). Neurologic events that led to permanent discontinuation of treatment included tremor (4.3%), 
and aphasia, encephalopathy, and seizure (2.6% for each). The subject incidences of grade ≥ 3 and 
grade 4 neurologic events were 12.1% and 2.6%, respectively. No fatal neurologic events were identified. 
Of the 61 subjects identified as having a neurologic event, 55 subjects (47.4%) were identified as having 
events considered related to blinatumomab by the investigator.  
As compared the adult MRD-positive ALL population (n=137) to the adult R/R ALL population, neurologic 
events were generally more frequently reported in the adult MRD-positive ALL population than in the 
adult R/R Ph- ALL population: headache (39.4% vs 32.6%), tremor (29.2% vs 14.2%), insomnia (16.1% 
vs 11.6%), aphasia (11.7% vs 3.2%), and dizziness (10.2% vs 9.8%). Permanent discontinuation by 
nervous system disorders (SOC 9.5% vs 3.4%) was more frequently reported in MRD+ population than in 
R/R ALL population: tremor (3.6% ), seizure (2.9%), encephalopathy (2.2%) and aphasia (2.2%) in the 
adult MRD-positive ALL population versus ≤ 1.3% for each in the adult R/R Ph- ALL populations. 
The incidences of serious neurologic events, grade ≥ 3 neurologic events, neurological events leading to 
treatment discontinuation and interruption were all much higher in MRD than in R/R ALL population. The 
onset of neurological events after 1st dose of Blincyto was more quickly in MRD than in R/R ALL

population (median 2.0 days vs 6.0 days). The median time to first onset of grade ≥ 3 neurologic event 
was also much shorter in MRD population than in R/R ALL population (4.0 days vs 17.0 days).  
Signs and symptoms suggestive of infusion reactions were identified in 86.2% (100/116) of subjects. The 
most frequently reported events (preferred terms in ≥ 5% of subjects) that may be associated with 
infusion reactions were pyrexia (68.1%; 79/116), chills (20.7%; 24/116), headache (15.5%; 18/116), 
vomiting (12.9%; 15/116), and hypotension and nausea (8.6%; 10/116 for each). Serious infusion 
reaction events were identified for 5.2% (6/116). The subject incidences of grade ≥ 3 and grade 4 
infusion reaction events were 8.6% (10/116) and 1.7% (2/116), respectively. No fatal infusion reaction 
events were identified. 
As compared the adult MRD-positive ALL population (n=137) to the adult R/R ALL population, infusion 
reaction events were reported for 90.5% of subjects including 13.9% serious infusion events, which were 
both higher than in the adult R/R Ph- ALL population (50.8% and 2.5% serious). Grade ≥ 3 and grade ≥ 
4 events, respectively, were reported for 10.2% and 0.7% in the adult MRD-positive ALL population, 
which was generally consistent with other populations. No fatal infusion reaction events were reported. In 
the adult MRD-positive ALL population, two most frequently reported infusion reaction events was pyrexia 
(85.4%) and hypotension (12.4%), both of these were higher than in the adult R/R Ph- ALL 
population(pyrexia 40.0%, hypotension <5%). The median time to onset of the first infusion reaction 
event was 1.0 days (range: 1 to 87 days) for the adult MRD-positive ALL population and 2.0 days (range: 
1 to 190 days) for the adult R/R ALL populations. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
This type II variation seeks to broaden the existing Blincyto indication for ALL to include all adult patients 
with minimal residual disease (MRD) positive B-precursor ALL. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
As per the EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/788794/2009 the proposed indication did not constitute an unmet medical 
need.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The MAH submitted a single pivotal open-label non-comparative (Study MT103-203, n=116)) which was 
supported by a supportive study (MT103-202, n=20) and a retrospective historical study (study 
20120148). Indirect comparisons with historical studies by propensity score analysis were also submitted. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects who achieved a complete MRD response. 
RFS, OS, duration of MRD response, TTHR, mortality within 100-day after alloHSCT were analysed as 
secondary endpoints. The pivotal study enrolled 116 adult subjects with MRD-positive B-cell precursor 
ALL in complete hematological remission with the presence of MRD at a level of ≥10-3, without prior 
HSCT. The majority of studied population was Ph-negative (111/116) and in first CR (CR1 64.7%).  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
A complete MRD response rate was observed within the first cycle in 77.9% (88/113; 95% CI: 69.1, 
85.1) of subjects. 2 additional subjects had a complete MRD response at day 66 and day 77 respectively. 
The overall complete response rate for the Prim EP FAS was 79.6% (90/113; 95% CI: 71.0, 86.6), with a 
median time to complete MRD response of 29.0 days (range: 5 to 71 days). The MRD complete response 
achieved at cycle 1 was sustainable, with a median duration of 17.3 months. 
These results suggest a strong, rapid and sustained activity of Blincyto in MRD-negativity in subjects in 
CR with MRD+ ALL. 
RFS was calculated from initiation of Blincyto in this study in Ph-negative subjects at 18 months. The 18-
month KM estimate for haematological RFS, censored at HSCT or post-Blincyto chemotherapy, was 54% 
(95% CI: 33% to 70%) with not estimable median RFS (95% CI: 6.3 months to not estimable [n.e.]). 
The RFS was 17.9 months longer in MRD complete responders than in MRD non-responders (23.6M vs 
5.7M) according to a landmark analysis from day 45. RFS (not censored at HSCT or post-Blincyto 
chemotherapy) was 13.6 months longer in patients in CR1 than in CR2 or CR3 (24.6M vs 11.0M). Relapse 
history before Blincyto treatment seem representing a potential predictive factor on RFS outcome, 
although a high level of MRD-negativity was obtained in both CR1 (82.2%) and CR2 (71.1%) subgroups.  
After at least 18M follow-up, the median of OS, calculated from initiation of Blincyto, was not estimable. 
Nearly twice as many subjects who had an MRD complete response than MRD non-responders were alive 
as of the data cut-off date (62.5% vs 33.3%). The median OS was 28.4m longer for complete MRD 
responder at C1 compared with MRD non-responder. The 18-months OS uncensored at HSCT or post 
Blinatumomab chemotherapy is 65%. MRD non-responder at C1 had a median TTHR clearly shorter than 
in MRD complete responder (13.6m vs NE).

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The appropriateness of MRD response as a validated surrogate endpoint of direct clinical benefit is not 
established by robust evidence based on a documented and measurable correlation between MRD status 
and validated endpoints such as OS or EFS. Although available data have shown that MRD negativity at 
the end of induction therapy is a strong and independent prognostic indicator for relapse risk, no 
randomized and controlled studies have established a treatment effect on MRD that could quantitatively 
explain a treatment effect in terms of validated endpoints such as EFS or OS.  
Although no optimum cut-off has been established, 10-3 is not considered stringent enough as it probably 
selects patients just prior to morphological relapse. A more stringent cut-off of 10-4 would have been 
preferred for patient selection. 
Per guideline, RFS, OS and TTHR should be calculated from the time of the bone marrow aspiration when 
CR or CRh* was detected for the first time, until the date of documented hematological relapse, 
progressive disease, extramedullary relapse, or death due to any cause, whichever occurred earlier. 
However, in this study, these clinical endpoints were not well-defined. They were calculated from 
initiation of Blincyto instead of detection of CR for the first time, while the time of CR detection varied 
from 1 month to several years before the first dose of Blincyto in patients. These heterogeneous intervals 
between the time of CR detection and the first dose of Blincyto could bias RFS/OS calculation at inclusion. 
True RFS/OS calculated from the time of the bone marrow aspiration when CR or CRh* was unknown.  
The study population represents adult non-transplanted patients having Ph-negative ALL in CR/CRi 
without associated poor prognosis. The activity of Blincyto in Ph-positive patients was unknown.  
Median RFS and OS were shorter in transplanted subjects than in non-transplanted subjects after 
Blincyto. It is still questionable how Blincyto could hide the benefit of HSCT, and the increased mortality 
in subjects who received HSCT after treatment with blinatumomab is not understood. Possible deleterious 
effects of HSCT in subjects after achieving MRD-negativity by Blincyto cannot be clearly excluded.  
Furthermore, the exploration of HSCT effect in propensity score analysis clearly demonstrated a 
paradoxical phenomenon: In the absence of HSCT, Blincyto group reduced 60% of death as compared to 
historical control, while this clinically meaningful improvement was not observed in subjects with HSCT. 
Paradoxically, in historical control arm, the risk of mortality was reduced by 38% in subject with HSCT 
than without HSCT. While, in Blincyto arm, this risk of mortality was increased by 57% in subject with 
HSCT than without HSCT. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
A total of 843 subjects from 8 clinical studies received blinatumomab. Of these 843 subjects, 706 
subjects with relapsed/refractory ALL are included in the total relapsed/refractory ALL population from 6 
of the 8 clinical studies and 137 subjects are included in the adult MRD-positive ALL population from 
pivotal study MT103-203 (N = 116) or supportive study MT103-202 (N = 21). 
The highest incidences (≥ 50%) of TEAE by system organ class (SOC) were General Disorders and 
Administration Site Conditions (94.8%; 110/116), Nervous System Disorders (68.1%; 79/116), and 
Gastrointestinal Disorders (53.4%; 62/116). The most frequently reported TEAEs (preferred terms in > 
20% of subjects) were pyrexia (88.8%; 103/116), headache (37.9%; 44/116), tremor (30.2%; 35/116), 
chills (25.9%; 30/116), fatigue (24.1%; 28/116), nausea (23.3%; 27/116), and vomiting (22.4%; 
26/116). 
Treatment-emergent grade ≥ 3 adverse events (preferred term in ≥ 5% of subjects) included neutropenia 
(15.5%; 18/116), pyrexia (7.8%; 9/116), leukopenia (6%; 7/116), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
increased and tremor (5.2%; 6/116 for each).

Events of interest (EOI) for the blinatumomab program include neurologic events, infections, CRS, drug 
related hepatic disorders, infusion reactions, tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), thromboembolic events, 
medication errors, cytopenias, decreased immunoglobulins, capillary leak syndrome (CLS), pancreatitis 
and leukoencephalopathy (including progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy [PML]). 
The incidences of neurologic events and infusion reaction in MRD+ studies were unusually high with quick 
onset.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Although data are limited due to the small size of the trial and hampered by the open-label design, safety 
was generally in line with the known safety profile of Blincyto. 
There were no uncertainties in the knowledge of the unfavourable effects.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
A strong, rapid and sustained activity of Blincyto in MRD-negativity subjects with MRD positive B-cell 
precursor ALL has been demonstrated in the pivotal and supportive trials and deemed relevant in itself. 
However, as yet, it is uncertain that MRD-negativity in ALL subject obtained by Blincyto is equivalent to 
“spontaneous” MRD-negative. There is no robust indisputable evidence to prove its plausibility by 
establishing a measurable correlation between MRD negativity and a direct clinical benefit. Clinical 
endpoints such as RFS and OS were not appropriately and therefore cannot be considered as evidence of 
benefit. Median RFS and OS were shorter in transplanted subjects than in non-transplanted subjects after 
Blincyto. Of a total of 53 deaths, 23 occurred while the subjects were in CR after HSCT (23 out of a total 
of 90 subjects who received HSCT after starting Blincyto, 25.6%), and only 3 deaths occurred in subjects 
achieving a CR without undergoing HSCT (3 out of a total of 26 subjects who did not receive HSCT, 
11.5%). Some transplanted patients died even 30 months after their HSCT. The causes of these fatal

outcomes are unknown. Their causality relative to Blincyto, to HSCT or to disease progression has to be 
analysed. 
Safety data were collected from uncontrolled and open-label studies, however there were no specific 
concerns as the type of adverse events with Blincyto treatment of ALL subjects with MRD was consistent 
with known safety information from Blincyto monotherapy in R/R ALL indication.    
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
 Therapeutic efficacy of Blincyto in the treatment of adults with minimal residual disease (MRD) positive 
B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) for BLINCYTO has not been 
established.  Specifically, whilst an effect on MRD response has been quantified, a clinical benefit of MRD 
response is not established and surrogacy of MRD response to increased survival has not been 
established.  In the absence of demonstrated efficacy, the benefit – risk of Blincyto in this setting is 
considered negative.

5.  Re-examination of the CHMP opinion of 15 November 2018 
Following the CHMP conclusion that the extension of indication applied for Blincyto was not approvable, 
the MAH submitted detailed grounds for the re-examination of the grounds for refusal.  
5.1.  Detailed grounds for re-examination submitted by the applicant 
The applicant presented its grounds for re-examination in writing. A summary of the MAH’s grounds for 
re-examination is presented below. 
Clinical Ground No. 1 (Therapeutic efficacy of Blincyto in the treatment of adults with minimal residual 
disease (MRD) positive B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) for BLINCYTO has not been 
established). 
The MAH considered that blinatumomab’s ability to induce a high complete MRD response did lead to a 
durable hematologic CR in patients with B-precursor ALL who were at very high risk of relapse due to 
their MRD-positive status at study entry. In Study MT103-203, blinatumomab induced a complete MRD 
response within 1 treatment cycle in 77.9% of the subjects (88/113 subjects; 95% CI: 69.1 to 85.1); 2 
additional subjects had a complete MRD response during cycle 2 of treatment, for an overall complete 
MRD response rate of 79.6% (95% CI: 71.0, 86.6).  The median duration of complete MRD response was 
17.3 months (95% CI: 12.6 to 23.3).  The 18 month KM estimate for time to hematologic relapse (TTHR) 
(secondary analysis data cutoff date of 05 August 2015) was 67% (95% CI: 57, 76), and the median 
TTHR was not estimable (95% CI: 24.3 months, NE). The 18-month KM estimate for RFS, censored at 
HSCT or post-blinatumomab chemotherapy, was 54% (95% CI: 33, 70).  The KM estimate for OS at 
18 months was 65% (95% CI: 55, 73); the median OS was 36.5 months (95% CI:  19.2, NE).  OS 
results were updated using longer follow-up time with a data cutoff date of 1 June 2017 (approximately 3 
years of minimum follow-up time for those who survive that long).  After 3 years of follow-up time, the 
median OS was 33.7 months (95% CI: 19.7 months to NE), with no new events reported between 40 and 
60 months. According to the MAH, these results showed a plateau effect for OS after 3 years of follow up 
time. 
The median OS was 17.4 months longer for subjects in CR1 compared with subjects in CR2/CR3 (CR1 
median OS: 36.5 months; CR2/CR3 median OS:  19.1 months).  The OS 18 month KM estimate was 0.69 
for CR1 and 0.56 for CR2/CR3, with a hazard ratio using Cox proportion hazard model of 1.61 (95% CI:  
0.93 to 2.77; p value = 0.087).  However, stratified landmark analyses of OS at day 45 showed MRD 
responders had more favorable OS than MRD non-responders, regardless of baseline relapse history.  
According to the MAH, these additional post-hoc landmark analyses of RFS and OS by MRD response and 
relapse history suggested that improvements in RFS and OS are directly related blinatumomab’s ability to 
induce a complete MRD response irrespective of relapse history.   
The MAH furthermore argued that efficacy results from the earlier supportive phase 2 study MT103-202 
were consistent with those reported in Study MT103-203.  In addition, results from the historical 
comparator study 20120148 showed that 18-month RFS, censored at HSCT, was 37% (95% CI: 28, 46) 
and 18-month OS, uncensored at HSCT, was 56% (95% CI: 49, 64), which were lower than the results 
Assessment report  
EMA/847661/2018 
Page 102/125 
 
  
  
 
observed in the pivotal study MT103-203, which showed 18-month RFS, censored at HSCT or 
post-blinatumomab chemotherapy, of 54% (95% CI: 33, 70) and 18-month OS, uncensored at HSCT or 
post-blinatumomab chemotherapy, of 65% (95% CI: 55, 73). 
In conclusion, the MAH considered that blinatumomab does have strong, rapid, and sustained activity 
that induces MRD negativity in subjects in CR with MRD positive ALL. Therefore, this clear anti-tumor 
activity does represent a clinical benefit for patients with MRD-positive ALL, even in the absence of 
randomized controlled data. 
Clinical Ground No.2 (Although an effect on MRD response has been quantified, a clinical benefit of 
MRD response is not established and surrogacy of MRD response to increased survival has not been 
established). 
The MAH argued that although MRD negativity has not been validated as a surrogate endpoint, as pointed 
out above in clinical ground 1 and in the absence of survival data from randomized controlled trials, the 
data from Study MT103-203 clearly demonstrated that blinatumomab does have antitumor activity in 
patients with MRD positive B precursor ALL.  The MAH considered that the magnitude of MRD negativity 
and the RFS and OS data from Study MT103-203 provided sufficient evidence that achieving complete 
MRD response with blinatumomab is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit (ie, prolonged RFS and 
OS) in subjects with MRD-positive B-cell precursor ALL.  The MAH argued that the SAG experts 
recommended that longer follow-up data on OS following HSCT should be collected and presented post 
approval to address some of the uncertainties about long-term outcomes.  The MAH’s proposals for 
confirmation via subsequent randomized controlled trials and a long-term post-approval follow-up study 
are in line with the experts’ recommendations and regulatory guidance and are not uncommon for drugs 
with high anti-tumor activity.  
The MAH highlighted that MRD is a direct measure of disease burden with cancer cells in the bone marrow 
and is not a tumor marker.  Recurrent or resistant ALL exists along a continuum, with MRD (ie, molecular 
level disease) on one end and overt leukemia (ie, morphological disease) on the other end of the 
spectrum.  Traditionally, evaluation of response to therapy has been limited to hematological CR (<5%) 
by microscopy.  Advancement with more sensitive technologies (such as flow cytometry or PCR) allows 
leukemia to be detected at submicroscopic levels.  After induction and/or consolidation treatment, 
patients who achieve hematologic CR but are MRD positive are very unlikely to achieve MRD negativity 
with additional rounds of chemotherapy, largely because these patients have already received SOC 
chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of ALL and these submicroscopic leukemia cells have already 
survived exposure to these treatments.  As such, the presence of MRD indicates that a patient has not 
achieved a true disease-free state.  However, there are no approved therapies specifically to treat 
MRD-positive patients, and there are no effective chemotherapies for these patients.  Allogeneic HSCT is 
the only available treatment option for patients with MRD-positive ALL, but the outcome is far from 
optimal.  Patients with MRD-positive disease may relapse while waiting for HSCT, and those who are MRD 
positive prior to HSCT have worse outcomes compared to patients who are MRD negative prior to HSCT 
(Bar et al, 2014; Gökbuget et al, 2012a).  
Clinical Ground No. 3 (Ongoing studies to address uncertainties in the MRD-positive ALL population) 
The MAH argued that the clinical program in ALL (Table 42) will address the uncertainties in the MRD-
positive ALL population.

•  Study E1910, conducted by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) and sponsored by the 
National Cancer Institute (NCI), is a phase 3, randomized, controlled study to assess the effect of 
blinatumomab in combination with induction chemotherapy compared with induction chemotherapy 
alone for adult patients (≥ 30 through ≤ 70 years of age) with newly diagnosed Philadelphia 
chromosome-negative B-cell ALL. Patients who achieve CR1 and are MRD negative will be randomized 
to blinatumomab or SOC chemotherapy, and those who are MRD positive after achieving CR1 will 
receive blinatumomab. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the OS associated with 
blinatumomab in conjunction with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone in patients with 
Philadelphia-negative B-cell ALL who are MRD negative after induction and intensification 
chemotherapy. A secondary objective is to compare OS and RFS of patients who are MRD positive at 
randomization/registration and then convert to MRD negative after 2 cycles of blinatumomab to 
patients who are MRD negative at randomization and remain so after 2 cycles of blinatumomab or 
consolidation chemotherapy.  
•  Study AALL1331, conducted by the Children’s Oncology Group (COG) and sponsored by the NCI, is a 
phase 3, open-label, randomized, parallel group study to evaluate efficacy and safety of 
blinatumomab compared with standard combination chemotherapy in treating patients with B-cell ALL 
in first relapse. This is a group wide risk-stratified study to test whether incorporation of 
blinatumomab into the treatment of patients with childhood B-cell ALL at first relapse will improve 
DFS (the primary endpoint). Patients are randomized to blinatumomab or SOC chemotherapy arms 
based on level of risk. Risk stratification is determined based on site of relapse (marrow versus 
isolated extramedullary [IEM]), time to relapse, and MRD status following a uniform first block of 
chemotherapy. High and intermediate risk patients are randomized to either a control arm with 2 
additional blocks of chemotherapy, or an experimental arm with 2 blocks of blinatumomab. Both arms 
will proceed to protocol-specified HSCT. Low risk patients are randomized to either a control arm with 
2 blocks of chemotherapy followed by continuation and maintenance chemotherapy, or an 
experimental arm with 1 block of chemotherapy, 2 blocks of blinatumomab, each followed by 
continuation and a third additional block of blinatumomab followed by maintenance. 
Overall survival is a key secondary endpoint for this study. The most relevant population to address 
the MRD-positive ALL population is the high-risk group, which includes MRD-positive patients in CR2. 
This study will provide extensive long-term follow-up data as patients will be followed for 10 years. 
This follow-up will allow for adequate assessment of OS and for survival after transplantation. The 
Assessment report

data generated from this study will also provide evidence of survival by MRD-negativity status. To 
cover the age groups not included in the E1910 study, Study AALL1331 includes patients who are 
between the ages of 1 year to < 31 years. As of August 2018, approximately 16.3% of patients 
enrolled are young adults (ages 18 to 30 years of age) and 83.7% of patients enrolled are children. 
Although patients ≥ 31 years of age are not included in this study, Berry et al (2017) have shown 
that the value of achieving MRD negativity is substantial in both the pediatric and adult patients with 
ALL.  
•  Study 20120215, conducted by Amgen in cooperation with the International Berlin-Frankfurt-Munich 
(I-BFM) Study Group, is a randomized, open-label, controlled, phase 3 study to investigate the 
efficacy and safety of blinatumomab as consolidation therapy versus European consolidation therapy 
in pediatric patients (> 28 days to < 18 years of age) with high-risk first relapse B-cell precursor ALL. 
After induction therapy and 2 blocks of high-risk consolidation (HC) chemotherapy, pediatric patients 
with high-risk first relapse B-precursor ALL are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either blinatumomab or a 
third block of standard HC3 chemotherapy. Randomization will be stratified by age, marrow status 
determined at the end of HC2, and MRD status determined at the end of induction. The primary 
endpoint is EFS with OS as a key secondary endpoint. The data from this study will also provide 
evidence of survival by MRD negativity status. This study will provide extensive long-term follow-up 
data as subjects will be followed for 3 years after allogeneic HSCT or until death, whichever occurs 
first. This follow-up will allow for adequate assessment of OS and for survival after transplantation. 
Although Study 20120215 is a robust study to assess the impact of blinatumomab compared with 
SOC chemotherapy, it is limited to studying patients who are less than 18 years of age. Although 
patients < 18 years of age are not included in Study MT103-203, Berry et al (2017) have shown that 
the value of achieving MRD negativity is substantial in both the pediatric and adult patients with ALL. 
Results for this study are expected in 2023.  
• 
In addition to the ongoing randomized studies, Amgen is developing a long-term observational study 
to study (Study 20170610) that will characterize post-transplant outcomes of patients that were 
re/induced with blinatumomab. These outcomes will be compared to patients that received SOC 
chemotherapy in the relapse/refractory ALL setting. The protocol for this long-term observational 
study will also capture the MRD status of patients at the time of transplant. Patients may be followed 
for up to 10 years. This study will also help to better understand the questions surrounding outcomes 
related to post-transplant outcomes after blinatumomab treatment. Results for this study are 
expected in 2022.  
Clinical Ground No. 4 (Indication limited to the Philadelphia chromosome-negative population). During 
the re-examination procedure and following the CHMP’s request during the initial assessment of the 
extension of indication, the MAH applied for the following indication: 
BLINCYTO is indicated for the treatment of adults with Philadelphia chromosome-negative minimal 
residual disease (MRD) positive B-precursor ALL.  
Clinical Ground No. 5 (Uncertainties regarding the impact of HSCT after blinatumomab on long-term 
outcomes). Based on the results of the analyses presented in the previous responses, the MAH considered 
that blinatumomab consistently showed a survival benefit in the transplant setting. After 3 years of 
follow-up time in Study MT103-203, subjects who achieved complete MRD response in cycle 1 and 
received HSCT while in hematologic CR had better OS than subjects who did not achieve complete MRD 
response in cycle 1 but were in hematologic CR at the time of HSCT. Using the updated data, the 100-day 
mortality rate following HSCT remains unchanged, because since the first follow up until 2015, no 
additional subjects underwent transplantation. The 100-day HSCT mortality rate for subjects who died 
Assessment report  
EMA/847661/2018 
Page 106/125 
 
  
  
 
while in continuous CR after HSCT was < 10% (7.9%; 6/76 subjects), which is lower than the 100-day 
mortality rate of 28% observed in literature (Bishop et al, 2008).  
In addition, the MAH considered that the high rate of HSCT in Study MT103-203, while partly attributable 
to a general increase in the rate of transplantation over time, is largely due to the success of 
blinatumomab in inducing complete MRD responses and the desire of investigators to transplant patients 
who achieved complete MRD response, which is a goal of therapy in order to prolong OS for these 
patients. An HSCT was planned for 81.9% of subjects in Study MT103-203. For 45.7% of subjects overall, 
an HSCT was planned regardless of whether the subject achieved an MRD response. This rate is similar to 
the overall rate of transplant in Study 20120148 (36.8% [49 of 133 subjects]. However, for an additional 
31.0% of subjects, HSCT was planned only if the subject achieved an MRD response. 
In the primary endpoint FAS in Study MT103-203, the rate of HSCT for subjects in CR was 71.6% (63 out 
of 88) in subjects who achieved a complete MRD response within cycle 1 compared to 40.0% (10 out of 
25) in subjects who did not achieve a complete MRD response within cycle 1, which was similar to the 
HSCT rate in the historical comparator Study 20120148 (36.8% [49 of 133 subjects]. The MAH argued 
that   given that 78% of subjects overall did achieve a complete MRD response in Study MT103-203, it 
can be concluded that the significant increase in the HSCT rate between the historical comparator study 
20120148 and Study MT103-203, while partly attributable to a general increase in the rate of 
transplantation over time due to wider donor availability and improvements in transplant technology, is 
primarily due to the high complete MRD response rate in subjects who received blinatumomab in Study 
MT103-203. In addition, the fact that more and older subjects underwent HSCT in Study MT103-203 is 
supported by a substantial difference in age between subjects in Study MT103-203 and Study 20120148, 
and the median age of subjects who underwent HSCT was a decade higher in subjects in Study MT103-
203 compared to subjects in Study 20120148. For example, in Study MT103-203, 4 subjects over 65 
years of age underwent HSCT. Two of them were alive at the last follow-up visit. The high proportion of 
33% of subjects with HSCT with mismatched donors also reflects enabling HSCT for subjects in Study 
MT103-203 who were probably otherwise not suitable for transplantation. 
The MAH confirmed that in line with the advice given by experts at the SAG-O meeting in November 
2017, transplant outcomes will be assessed in the observational study (Study 20170610) that will be 
conducted as part of the EMEA/H/C/003731/II/0009 variation (see RMP). 
5.2.  Scientific Advisory Group- consultation 
Following a request from the MAH at the time of the re-examination, the CHMP convened a Scientific 
Advisory Group (SAG) inviting the experts to provide their views on the CHMP grounds for refusal, taking 
into account the applicant’s response. 
The SAG should comment on the grounds for negative opinion in view of the grounds for re-examination 
submitted by the applicant: 
• 
• 
Therapeutic efficacy of Blincyto in the treatment of adults with minimal residual disease (MRD) 
positive B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) for BLINCYTO has not been 
established.  Specifically, whilst an effect on MRD response has been quantified, a clinical benefit 
of MRD response is not established and surrogacy of MRD response to increased survival has not 
been established.   
In the absence of demonstrated efficacy, the benefit – risk of Blincyto in this setting is considered 
negative. 
Assessment report  
EMA/847661/2018 
Page 107/125 
 
  
  
 
Based on the input from the experts on how MRD is measured and its validity in the tumour burden in 
ALL, the SAG unanimously agreed that MRD negativity is an important clinical objective in B-cell 
precursor ALL patients with residual disease.  
Based on the pivotal study submitted, patients’ residual disease level to enter the trial was high (10-3). 
Such patients are at very high risk of frank relapse. Notably, the majority of patients did achieve MRD 
negativity after one course of Blincyto and had extended disease free survival. 
Blincyto is approved for treatment of relapsed patients based on a randomized study that has shown 
improvement in overall survival. Thus, the effect of Blincyto of allowing patients with residual disease to 
obtain MRD negativity, delaying what would otherwise be imminent frank disease relapse, is considered 
clinically significant and important. The SAG considered that efficacy has been demonstrated and that the 
balance of benefits and risks is positive.  
Given the clinical importance of reaching MRD negativity to avoid recurrence, demonstrating formal 
surrogacy with respect to overall survival is not considered necessary. In any case, following frank 
relapse, which is rapidly expected for MRD-positive patients in absence of treatment, Blincyto was 
associated with a positive effect on overall survival. Thus, apart from the clinically important effect of 
delaying recurrence, it is reasonable to assume that inducing MRD negativity in this high risk patient 
population will also result in survival benefit.  
In addition, in the context of the re-examination procedure for this application, the SAG is asked to 
provide its views on the following issues: 
1.  As MRD-positivity is reflective of chemo-resistant disease, does the SAG consider that 
the prognostic value of MRD conversion prior to HSCT reasonably may differ 
depending on the mechanism by which MRD-negativity is obtained, i.e. 
immunologically mediated (as with blinatumomab) vs chemotherapy-induced? 
There is no reason to believe that the prognostic value of MRD conversion would differ according to the 
mechanism involved. There is however the potential that immunologically-mediated MRD-negativity might 
translate into more durable disease control compared to chemotherapy, at least in some patients. The 
depth of remission after blinatumomab may be deeper as it has a different mechanism in these partially 
chemo-refractory patients. This possibility, if confirmed would be an additional very important goal, 
namely, achieving long-term remission and avoiding HSCT. Long-term follow-up through a registry and 
further biomarker identification would be of interest to explore this potential. 
Concerning post-transplant mortality, the proportion observed in the pivotal study for Blincyto does not 
raise concerns given the patient characteristics, which highlight a poor prognosis, particularly in terms of 
age, type of donor (1/3 mismatched transplant) and stage of ALL (1/3 2nd CR and some CR3). Based on 
the non-randomized data with no protocol defined definitions on precise indications and specified “high 
dose regimens, with these caveats there is no concern about a possible adverse effect of Blincyto on 
HSCT.  
2.  Does the SAG consider that the ongoing and planned studies cited by the applicant will 
adequately address the remaining outstanding uncertainties identified during the 
review, including the predictive role of blinatumomab-induced MRD conversion, not 
least in terms of longer-term outcomes, and the impact of HSCT after blinatumomab 
therapy? 
A number of important studies were discussed by the applicant. However, understandably, no study is 
primarily aiming to present a well-powered randomized comparison of overall survival of Blincyto v. no 
treatment in this high-risk disease population since Blincyto has been shown to be highly effective in 
inducing MRD negativity. Given that this important clinical goal is achieved and given that a detriment in 
Assessment report  
EMA/847661/2018 
Page 108/125 
 
  
  
overall survival is unlikely based on the positive effect of survival in a slightly later stage of disease when 
patients formally meet the criteria for recurrence, a direct comparison is considered unnecessary. 
However, long-term follow-up through a registry and further biomarker identification would be of interest 
(see above). 
3.  Please discuss whether available evidence supports the use of blinatumomab 
treatment in subjects deemed not fit for HSCT? 
Yes, available evidence supports the use of blinatumomab treatment in subjects deemed not fit for HSCT 
based on the ability of Blincyto to delay frank recurrence.  
5.3.  Discussion and overall conclusion on grounds for re-examination 
Overall conclusion on grounds for re-examination  
The CHMP assessed all the detailed grounds for re-examination and argumentations presented by the 
MAH and considered the views of the Scientific Advisory Group.  
Concerning clinical ground No. 1, the CHMP further discussed the MAH’s arguments.  
Based on the results of the study MT103-203, 77.9% of patients achieved MRD complete response. Two 
additional subjects had a complete MRD response at day 66 and day 77 respectively. The majority of 
these patients did achieve MRD negativity after one cycle of Blincyto and had extended disease free 
survival. Moreover, the percentage of patients with MRD <10-4 was almost 87%.  The MRD complete 
response achieved at cycle 1 was sustainable, with a median duration of 17.3 months. The CHMP 
concluded that these results suggest a strong, rapid and sustained pharmacodynamic activity of Blincyto 
in MRD-negativity in adult patients having Ph-negative ALL in CR/CRi.  
Concerning clinical ground No.2, during the initial assessment of this application the CHMP noted that 
MRD response had not been established as surrogate endpoint of direct clinical benefit; differences in 
MRD negativity between randomised and interventional had not been shown to be predictive of the 
hazard ratio (HR) between arms for event free survival (EFS) or OS. The CHMP acknowledged that 
patients in CR that are MRD positive have a poor prognosis and an unmet medical need. Considering the 
residual disease level to enter the trial which was high (10-3), the patients are at very high risk of frank 
relapse.  
MRD negativity at the end of induction therapy is a strong and independent prognostic indicator for 
relapse risk. A profound reduction of tumour load is therefore the key factor for durable remission. The 
CHMP agreed with the SAG experts that given the clinical importance of reaching MRD negativity to avoid 
recurrence, demonstrating formal surrogacy with respect to overall survival is not considered necessary. 
In absence of treatment with Blincyto, MRD-positive patients will relapse. Therefore if these high risk 
patients are treated with Blincyto and reach MRD negativity, this may impact overall survival. This 
assumption is also supported by the demonstration of an OS gain over standard of care when treating 
patients in the relapsed/refractory setting.  Furthermore, there is a lack of any available specific therapy.  
Concerning clinical ground No. 3 and the ongoing clinical studies, the CHMP agreed that while it is not 
expected that the surrogacy of MRD will be established, these studies are important to further 
characterise long-term outcomes in patients treated with Blincyto and to provide data on outcomes after 
HSCT in patients treated with Blincyto.     
Concerning clinical ground No. 4 regarding the proposed indication, the CHMP agreed with the MAH 
that the indication should specify ‘‘Philadelphia chromosome-negative’’. In addition to this, the CHMP 
considered that the indication should define that patients should be in first or second complete remission, 
Assessment report  
EMA/847661/2018 
Page 109/125 
 
  
  
 
as was 98% of the study population. Therefore the indication has been revised as follows: BLINCYTO is 
indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adults with Philadelphia chromosome negative CD19 
positive B-precursor ALL in first or second complete remission with minimal residual disease (MRD) 
greater than or equal to 0.1%. 
Concerning clinical ground No.5 the CHMP acknowledged that the increased HSCT rate between the 
historical comparator study 20120148 and Study MT103-203, is partly due to a general increase in the 
rate of transplantation over time but primarily due to the high MRD conversion rate seen in MT103-203, 
and also a higher number of older subjects were transplanted in this study as compared to the historical 
controls. The CHMP highlighted that, 23 deaths (out of 53 deaths) occurred while the subjects were in CR 
after HSCT (23 out of a total of 90 subjects who received HSCT after starting Blincyto, 25.6%), and only 
3 deaths occurred in subjects achieving a CR without undergoing HSCT (3 out of a total of 26 subjects 
who did not receive HSCT, 11.5%). Based on the above, the CHMP concluded that the proportion of 
deaths observed in the pivotal study for Blincyto did not raise concerns given the poor prognosis of the 
studies population. Both studies AALL1331 and E1910 described above will provide data on outcomes 
after HSCT in patients treated with Blincyto. 
5.4.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 9.1 is acceptable.  
The MAH is reminded that, within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the Opinion, an updated version of 
Annex I of the RMP template, reflecting the final RMP agreed at the time of the Opinion should be 
submitted to h-eurmp-evinterface@emea.europa.eu.

5.5.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated in 
order to add the new indication and its relevant posology and to update the safety information. The 
Package Leaflet is updated accordingly.  
5.5.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable.  
6.  Benefit-risk balance 
6.1.  Therapeutic Context 
6.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Blincyto as monotherapy is proposed for the treatment of adults with Philadelphia chromosome-negative 
CD19 positive B precursor ALL in first or second complete remission with minimal residual disease (MRD) 
greater than or equal to 0.1%. 
6.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Persistent MRD-positivity in adult patients after induction therapy and/or consolidation therapy in 
complete haematological remission (e.g. CR1) is considered an unmet medical need. The main goal in 
these patients is inducing MRD-negativity of sufficient duration to allow for stem-cell transplantation, the 
only potentially curative option in this setting with otherwise very poor prognosis.  
6.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The MAH submitted a single pivotal open-label non-comparative (Study MT103-203, n=116)) which was 
supported  by  a  supportive  study  (MT103-202,  n=20)  and  a  retrospective  historical  study  (study 
20120148). Indirect comparisons with historical studies by propensity score analysis were also submitted. 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  proportion  of  subjects  who  achieved  a  complete  MRD  response. 
RFS,  OS,  duration  of  MRD  response,  TTHR,  mortality  within  100-day  after  alloHSCT  were  analysed  as 
secondary  endpoints.  The  pivotal  study  enrolled  116  adult  subjects  with  MRD-positive  B-cell  precursor 
ALL  in  complete  hematological  remission  with  the  presence  of  MRD  at  a  level  of  ≥10-3,  without  prior 
HSCT. The majority of studied population was Ph-negative (111/116) and in first CR (CR1 64.7%).  
6.2.  Favourable effects 
A  complete  MRD  response  rate  was  observed  within  the  first  cycle  in  77.9%  (88/113;  95%  CI:  69.1, 
85.1) of subjects. 2 additional subjects had a complete MRD response at day 66 and day 77 respectively. 
The overall complete response rate for the Prim EP FAS was 79.6% (90/113; 95% CI: 71.0, 86.6), with a 
median time to complete MRD response of 29.0 days (range: 5 to 71 days). The MRD complete response 
achieved at cycle 1 was sustainable, with a median duration of 17.3 months. 
These  results  suggest  a  strong,  rapid  and  sustained  activity  of  Blincyto  in  MRD-negativity  in  subjects  in 
CR with MRD+ ALL. 
RFS was calculated from initiation of Blincyto in this study in Ph-negative subjects at 18 months. The 18-
month KM estimate for haematological RFS, censored at HSCT or post-Blincyto chemotherapy, was 54% 
Assessment report  
EMA/847661/2018 
Page 121/125 
 
  
  
(95%  CI:  33%  to  70%)  with  not  estimable  median  RFS  (95%  CI:  6.3  months  to  not  estimable  [n.e.]). 
The  RFS  was  17.9  months  longer  in  MRD  complete  responders  than  in  MRD  non-responders  (23.6M  vs 
5.7M)  according  to  a  landmark  analysis  from  day  45.  RFS  (not  censored  at  HSCT  or  post-Blincyto 
chemotherapy) was 13.6 months longer in patients in CR1 than in CR2 or CR3 (24.6M vs 11.0M). 
After at least 18M follow-up, the median of OS, calculated from initiation of Blincyto, was not estimable. 
Nearly twice as many subjects who had an MRD complete response than MRD non-responders were alive 
as  of  the  data  cut-off  date  (62.5%  vs  33.3%).  The  median  OS  was  28.4m  longer  for  complete  MRD 
responder  at  C1  compared  with  MRD  non-responder.  The  18-months  OS  uncensored  at  HSCT  or  post 
blinatumomab chemotherapy is 65%. MRD non-responder at C1 had a median TTHR clearly shorter than 
in MRD complete responder (13.6m vs NE).   
6.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The appropriateness of MRD response as a validated surrogate endpoint of direct clinical benefit was not 
established by robust evidence based on a documented and measurable correlation between MRD status 
and validated endpoints such as OS or EFS (see below, section 6.7.1.).   
Of a total of 53 deaths, 23 occurred while the subjects were in CR after HSCT (23 out of a total of 90 
subjects who received HSCT after starting Blincyto, 25.6%), and only 3 deaths occurred in subjects 
achieving a CR without undergoing HSCT (3 out of a total of 26 subjects who did not receive HSCT, 
11.5%). Some transplanted patients died even 30 months after their HSCT. The CHMP concluded that the 
proportion of deaths observed in the pivotal study for Blincyto did not raise specific concerns given the 
poor prognosis of the studies population and the small numbers. Furthermore studies AALL1331 and 
E1910 will provide data on outcomes after HSCT in patients treated with Blincyto. 
6.4.  Unfavourable effects 
A total of 843 subjects from 8 clinical studies received blinatumomab. Of these 843 subjects, 706 
subjects with relapsed/refractory ALL are included in the total relapsed/refractory ALL population from 6 
of the 8 clinical studies and 137 subjects are included in the adult MRD-positive ALL population from 
pivotal study MT103-203 (N = 116) or supportive study MT103-202 (N = 21). 
The highest incidences (≥ 50%) of TEAE by system organ class (SOC) were General Disorders and

6.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Although data are limited due to the small size of the trial and hampered by the open-label design, safety 
was generally in line with the known safety profile of Blincyto; therefore no specific uncertainties have 
arisen in the present study. 
There is some uncertainty about the impact of Blincyto on the outcome of HSCT, as randomized data are 
not available (and are not feasilble to obtain). However the CHMP recommended the applicant to submit 
the results from the studies AALL1331 and E1910 in order to get more data on outcomes after HSCT in 
patients treated with Blincyto.

6.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
6.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
While the surrogacy of MRD for RFS and OS has not been established, MRD in the present scenario is a 
sensitive marker for residual disease, which is illustrated by the fact MRD positive patients will generally 
experience imminent relapse without further intervention. Furthermore, there is a lack of any available 
specific therapy. Therefore patients with CR that are MRD positive have a highly unmet medical need. 
Study MT103-203 demonstrated a compelling 78% rate of MRD negativisation (<10-4), as well as a 
clinically relevant DoR with a median of 17 months. Hence the CHMP concluded that, given these results 
and the clinical importance of reaching MRD negativity to avoid recurrence, demonstrating formal 
surrogacy with respect to overall survival is not considered necessary.  
The high proportion of subjects who achieved a complete MRD response (77.9%) with blinatumomab 
regimen in the pivotal study was considered clinically meaningful and significant, especially in the 
population studied with very poor prognosis. Other endpoints like duration of response and RFS were 
consistent with the notion of clinical benefit.  
The safety profile for the adult MRD-positive ALL population is consistent with the known safety profile of 
blinatumomab in relapsed/refractory ALL.  
6.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The activity of Blincyto in MRD-negativity in subjects with MRD positive B-cell precursor ALL observed is 
clinically relevant. In such a setting, the available demonstration of outstanding pharmacodynamic 
activity in the presence of a manageable safety profile may be considered to establish clinical benefit. 
Therefore, the benefit risk for blinatumomab as monotherapy for the treatment of adults with Philadelphia 
chromosome-negative CD19 positive B precursor ALL in first or second complete remission with minimal 
residual disease (MRD) greater than or equal to 0.1% for BLINCYTO monotherapy is considered positive. 
6.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Blincyto is positive.

7.  Recommendations following re-examination 
Final outcome 
Based on the arguments of the applicant and all the supporting data on quality, safety and efficacy, the 
CHMP re-examined its initial opinion and in its final opinion considers the following variation acceptable 
and therefore recommends, by a majority of 29 out of 31 votes, the variation to the terms of the 
Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change to therapeutic indication - Addition of a 
Type II 
I, IIIB 
new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved 
one  
Extension of indication to include the treatment of adults with Philadelphia chromosome-negative CD19 
positive B precursor ALL in first or second complete remission with minimal residual disease (MRD) 
greater than or equal to 0.1% for BLINCYTO monotherapy; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 
and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated.  The Package Leaflet and the RMP (version 9.1) are updated in 
accordance. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder took the opportunity to update the contact 
details of the Portuguese and Irish local representatives in the Package Leaflet. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Package Leaflet and to 
the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Blincyto is not similar to Xaluprine, Incusig and Besponsa 
within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.

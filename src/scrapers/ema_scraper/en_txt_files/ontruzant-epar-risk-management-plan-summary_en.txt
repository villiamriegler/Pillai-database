PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN     
SUMMARY OF RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR ONTRUZANT® 
This  is  a  summary  of  the  risk  management  plan  (RMP)  for  Ontruzant®.  The  RMP  details 
important risks of Ontruzant®, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information 
will be obtained about Ontruzant®'s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Ontruzant®'s  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet  (PL)  give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Ontruzant® should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Ontruzant® should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).   
Important  new  concerns  or  changes  to  the  current  ones  will  be  included  in  updates  of 
Ontruzant®'s RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for
Ontruzant® is authorised for early breast cancer, metastatic breast cancer, and metastatic gastric 
cancer (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains trastuzumab as the active substance and it 
is given by powder for concentrate for solution for infusion. 
Further information about the evaluation of Ontruzant®’s benefits can be found in Ontruzant®’s 
EPAR,  including  in  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the  EMA  website,  under  the 
medicine’s webpage. 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further
characterise the risks 
Important risks of Ontruzant®, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Ontruzant®'s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
• Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;
•
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
• The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure
that the medicine is used correctly;
• The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with
or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In the case of Ontruzant®, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimisation  
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In  addition to these measures, information  about  adverse reactions  is  collected continuously 
and regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.   
If important information that may affect the safe use of Ontruzant® is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information
Important risks of Ontruzant® are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate  or  minimise  the  risk,  so  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  safely  administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Ontruzant®. Potential risks are concerns for 
which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association  has  not  been  established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information 
refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs 
to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

In  a  systematic  review  and  meta-analysis  27  clinical  factors  were 
identified to be associated with risk of incident Heart failure (HF) in 15 
observational  studies  in  unselected  community  populations  which 
followed  456,850  participants  over  4–29  years.  The  strongest

<Routine risk minimisation measures> 
Section 4.2 of the SmPC describes the correct method of administration 
Administration-related reactions 
for the first and subsequent infusions and the recommended observation 
times following these infusions. The need to be prepared for managing 
anaphylaxis and possible actions including interrupting or slowing the 
infusion rate if infusion-related reactions occur are also described. 
Section  4.4  warns  about  the  risk  of  infusion-related-reactions  and 
informs that patients experiencing dyspnoea at rest due to complications 
of advanced malignancy and comorbidities may be at increased risk of 
a  fatal  infusion  reaction.  This  section  also  provides  information 
concerning pre-medication and treatment for these reactions and warns 
about the possibility of delayed reactions.

<Routine risk minimisation measures> 
Section 4.6 of the SmPC warns about the risk of oligohydramnios and 
foetal harm and advises that women of childbearing potential should use 
effective  contraception  during  treatment  and  for  7  months  after 
treatment  with  trastuzumab.  It  also  states  that  trastuzumab  should  be 
avoided  during  pregnancy  unless  the  potential  benefit  for  the  mother 
outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. 
If a pregnant woman is treated with trastuzumab, or if a patient becomes 
pregnant while receiving trastuzumab or within 7 months following the 
last dose of trastuzumab, close monitoring by a multidisciplinary team 
is desirable. 
Section 4.8 of the SmPC lists the following undesirable effects: 
Oligohydramnios, Pulmonary hypoplasia and Renal hypoplasia.

increased risk of pulmonary events. 
Other  risk  factors  include  exposure  to  environmental  toxins,  family 
history of interstitial lung disease and history of smoking.

Section 4.3 contraindicates use of trastuzumab in patients with severe 
dyspnoea  at  rest  due  to  complications  of  advanced  malignancy  or 
requiring supplementary oxygen therapy. 
Section 4.4 warns about the risk of severe pulmonary events including 
interstitial  lung  disease  together  with  associated  risk  factors.  These 
events may occur as part of an infusion-related reaction or with a delayed 
onset.

Tumours of the GI tract can invade the mucosa, causing local abscess 
formation, bacteraemia, or perforation and resulting peritonitis. 
Neutrophils  are  the  single  most  important  cells  for  defence  against 
bacterial  infection  in  cancer  patients.  Solid  organ  tumours,  such  as 
metastatic carcinoma of the breast, prostate, lung, adrenal, thyroid, and 
kidney, can all infiltrate the bone marrow and result in neutropenia.16

Section 4.2 of the SmPC sates that Ontruzant® treatment should only 
be  initiated  by  a  physician  experienced  in  the  administration  of 
cytotoxic chemotherapy. It emphasises the importance of checking the 
product label to avoid medication errors and stresses that Ontruzant® 
IV  formulation  is  not  intended  for  subcutaneous  administration  and 
should be administered via an IV infusion only.

1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Requested group of variations 
Pursuant to Article 7.2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, AstraZeneca AB submitted to the 
European Medicines Agency on 30 September 2016 an application for a group of variations.  
The following changes were proposed:

Update of SmPC sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 based on the results from study D5160C00003 (AURA3) 
and the updated CSRs for studies D5160C00001 (AURAex) and D5160C00002 (AURA2). The Package Leaflet 
has been updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to make editorial changes in the 
SmPC and Package Leaflet. The application included an updated RMP version 6.0. The provision of the CSR 
from study AURA3 addresses the Specific Obligation for Tagrisso and hence the MAH requests the conversion 
from a Conditional Marketing Authorisation to a Marketing Authorisation not subject to Specific Obligations. 
The requested group of variations proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
1.2.  Rationale for the proposed changes 
The current Marketing Authorisation for TAGRISSO 40 mg and 80 mg tablets is a Conditional Marketing 
Authorisation (CMA) with the following Specific Obligation (SOB) with a due date of 30 June 2017: 
“In order to further confirm the efficacy and safety of osimertinib in the treatment of patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC, the applicant should submit the clinical 
study report of the phase III study AURA3 comparing osimertinib to platinum based doublet 
chemotherapy” 
This is a grouped application comprising three type II variations; the provision of the final CSR from study 
AURA3 (SOB) and updated data from the AURAex and AURA2 studies, for which earlier data-cuts were used 
as the basis for the initial CMA. 
With submission and eventual conclusion of this grouped variation including the AURA3 specific obligation 
study, the MAH requests conversion from CMA to a MA not subject to Specific Obligations, based on the 
confirmation of osimertinib efficacy and safety in the comparative, randomised Phase III study, AURA3 
(D5160C00003, A Phase III, open label, randomised study of AZD9291 vs. platinum based doublet 
chemotherapy for patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC whose disease has progressed with 
previous EGFR TKI therapy and whose tumours harbour an EGFRT790M mutation within the EGFR gene.). 
Both progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) data from AURA3 are required to fulfil the SOB 
for the CMA, and allow conversion to a MA not subject to SOBs. As the CSR and data for AURA3 included in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/134310/2017 
Page 4/113 
 
 
  
 
 
this submission is based on evaluation of PFS data only, it has been agreed that as an exception the OS data 
will be provided in this procedure in response to a Request for Supplementary Information (RSI). 
In addition, updated CSRs (edition number 3, data cut-off of 01 November 2015), for studies:  
- D5160C00001 (A Phase I/II, Open-Label, Multicentre Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability, 
Pharmacokinetics and Anti-tumour Activity of Ascending Doses of AZD9291 in Patients with Advanced 
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer who have Progressed Following Prior Therapy with an Epidermal Growth Factor 
Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Agent (AURAex));  
- AndD5160C00002 (A Phase II, Open Label, Single-arm Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of AZD9291 
in Patients with Locally Advanced/Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer whose Disease has Progressed with 
Previous Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Therapy and whose Tumours are 
Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Mutation and T790M Mutation Positive (AURA2));  
are also provided as part of the application. CSRs, with a data cut-off of 01 May 2015 were provided to EMA 
during review of the initial MAA. The data from the updated CSRs provides additional data supporting 
changes to the SmPC. 
2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
The MAH is hereby requesting an update of SmPC sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 based on the results 
from study D5160C00003 (AURA3) and the updated CSRs for studies D5160C00001 (AURAex) and 
D5160C00002 (AURA2). The MAH is also proposing a switch from a conditional marketing authorisation to a 
‘standard’ marketing authorisation (i.e. a marketing authorisation not subject to specific obligations) for 
osimertinib (AZD9291, TAGRISSO) for the treatment of adult patients with locally-advanced or metastatic 
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) T790M mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The 
company is basing this request on the provision of the phase III AURA3 study.  
AURA3 is a Phase III, open-label, randomised study (2:1 ratio [osimertinib:platinum-based chemotherapy]) 
specifically designed to compare the efficacy of osimertinib vs. platinum- based doublet chemotherapy 
(pemetrexed plus carboplatin or pemetrexed plus cisplatin, followed by optional pemetrexed maintenance) 
as second-line treatment in patients with confirmed advanced EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC who 
had progressed following 1st line treatment with an approved EGFR-TKI. 
Results from the AURA3 trial confirmed the previous positive benefit risk balance shown on the basis of the 
studies AURA extension and AURA2. The outcomes in terms of PFS, ORR, DoR and DCR were considered 
clinically meaningful and further support the efficacy ascertained at the time of the marketing authorisation 
based exclusively on response outcomes (ORR), whereas the safety profile of patients treated with 
osimertinib was consistent to that known from previous studies.  
During the procedure, the MAH was requested to provide preliminary OS results. As expected, data are 
currently not mature enough so as to draw firm conclusions about the potential longer survival of those 
patients treated with osimertinib, even though the current HR seems reassuring, highlighting a positive 
trend for osimertinib (HR: 0.72 [99.96% CIs: 0.34, 1.52]). A second analysis of OS will be performed when 
the OS data are approximately 50% mature (approximately 205 deaths events).  A third analysis of OS will 
be performed when the OS data are approximately 70% mature (approximately 287 deaths events). 
Nevertheless, it seems doubtful that the expected longer survival can be shown in future analyses, seeing as 
94/140 [67.1%] patients in the chemotherapy arm crossed over to receive treatment with osimertinib after 
RECIST progression. Neither the PFS2 data are capable of shedding light on the long-term effects of 
osimertinib, since the high number of censures does not allow achieving further conclusions. Despite the 
inability to collect informative mature OS data, the magnitude of effect seen with PFS, ORR, DoR and DCR, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/134310/2017 
Page 5/113 
 
 
  
 
 
supported by the reassuring HR in terms of OS in the first interim analysis, allow to conclude that the 
condition has been fulfilled with the provision of comprehensive data on the benefit-risk balance. 
A marketing authorisation not subject to specific obligation can be recommended at present based on the 
positive results observed in PFS and ORR, but with the commitment of submitting the two pending analyses 
of OS when available.  The MAH has made appropriate commitments in this regard and provided a Letter of 
Recommendations accordingly. This approach is considered acceptable especially in view of the fact that no 
new safety concerns have been identified and that results from the phase III trial (including the primary 
endpoint) are consistent with the already known efficacy data from previous studies.  
Thus, as the specific obligations are fulfilled, the CHMP is of the view that a switch from a conditional 
marketing authorisation to a full marketing authorisation can be recommended. The updated RMP version 
6.0 is agreed as well as the changes to the product information stemming from the CSR of study 
D5160C00003 (AURA3) and the updated CSRs for studies D5160C00001 (AURAex) and D5160C00002 
(AURA2). 
The benefit-risk balance of TAGRISSO remains positive.

4.  Scientific discussion 
4.1.  Introduction 
AstraZeneca is seeking full marketing approval for the use of osimertinib (AZD9291, TAGRISSO™) for the 
treatment of adult patients with locally-advanced or metastatic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 
T790M mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 
On 2 February 2016, the European Commission (EC) granted Conditional Marketing Authorisation (CMA) 
(EU/1/16/1086) for osimertinib 80 mg once daily (40 mg and 80 mg oral tablets) for use in this indication 
across the European Union (EU). The Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) was reviewed via the 
Accelerated Assessment procedure of the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The CMA was based on the 
objective response rate (ORR) (according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 
[RECIST v1.1]) as determined by blinded independent central review (BICR) of data from 2 open-label, 
single-arm Phase II studies of osimertinib (AURA extension [D5160C00001 Phase II component] and AURA2 
[D5160C00002]); and on the duration of response (DoR) and progression-free survival (PFS) by BICR in 1 
Phase I study (AURA [D5160C00001] Phase I component as of the DCO of 1 May 2015. The safety labelling 
was further informed by data from the 90-day safety update as of the second DCO (DCO2) of 1 May 2015. 
These 2 Phase II studies included a total of 411 patients with locally-advanced or metastatic 
NSCLC(advanced NSCLC hereafter) whose tumors carried the EGFR T790M mutation, as centrally confirmed 
by the cobas® EGFR Mutation Test [Roche Molecular Systems, Inc.]), who had progressed on prior systemic 
therapy that included at least 1 EGFR-TKI (second-line and ≥third-line patients; Ranson et al. 2013). Both 
Phase II studies are ongoing and updated data at the third DCO (DCO3) date of 1 November 2015 are now 
available (Yang et al 2016).  
The application for full approval is based on the confirmation of osimertinib efficacy and safety in an pivotal, 
comparative, randomised Phase III study, AURA3(D5160C00003), conducted in 419 patients with advanced 
EGFR T790M mutation-positiveNSCLC in second-line therapy versus (vs.) platinum-based chemotherapy 
(pemetrexed pluscisplatin or carboplatin), followed by pemetrexed maintenance, with PFS based on 
investigator assessment as the primary efficacy endpoint; overall survival (OS) and ORR are key secondary 
endpoints. Longer follow-up data (1 November 2015 DCO) from the 2 pooled single-arm Phase II studies of 
osimertinib in second-line and later-lines of therapy that were the basis for conditional approval, AURA 
extension and AURA2, are provided to support the consistency and durability of efficacy findings, to show the 
absence of unexpected additional toxicity burden with longer follow-up, and, especially, to inform and 
support prescribing information in the broader T790M population (second and ≥third-line of therapy), in line 
with the current indication. Additional support for the characterisation of the safety profile ofosimertinib in 
patients with advanced EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC is provided through an integrated safety 
analysis performed on larger pooled datasets taken from AURAPhase I study (N = 402); AURA extension (N 
= 201); AURA2 (N = 210); and AURA3osimertinib arm (N = 279). 
4.2.  Clinical Pharmacology aspects 
The osimertinib clinical pharmacology programme was designed to characterise osimertinib 
pharmacokinetics and to investigate the key factors that could potentially contribute to variability in 
exposure to osimertinib in the target NSCLC population. 
Elimination of osimertinib is primarily via hepatic metabolism, hence liver impairment may impact exposure 
of osimertinib. A clinical study evaluating the impact of hepatic impairment on the exposure of osimertinib is 
currently ongoing (Study 8; D5160C00008). 
A reduced design renal impairment study is ongoing for osimertinib (Study 35); however, as renal 
elimination of osimertinib and its related components is low (<15% of the dose and mostly as metabolites, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/134310/2017 
Page 7/113 
 
 
  
 
unchanged osimertinib <1% of the dose; Study 11), the impact of renal impairment on the exposure of 
osimertinib is likely to be minimal. 
Bioanalytical methods for the determination of osimertinib and its metabolites AZ7550 and AZ5104 in 
human EDTA plasma were developed and validated, on behalf of AstraZeneca, at Covance UK Ltd, 
Harrogate, UK were presented in the original NDA submission. Only the long term frozen stability data was 
updated (8277090 addendum) which shows that Osimertinib is stable for 400 days and the metabolites are 
stable for 169 days at -80°C. 
4.2.1.  Results 
Population PK evaluation  
A population pharmacokinetic model for osimertinib and its main metabolite AZ5104 had previously been 
developed, based on data from AURA, AURA2 and D5160C00005 (healthy subject data). Osimertinib was 
characterized in Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients over a wider (20 to 240 mg) dose range 
including PK samples up to 6 weeks (Cycle 3 Day 1). 
According to the previous popPK analysis, osimertinib pharmacokinetics (PK) was dose proportional across 
the 20 to 240 mg dose range studied and time independent. The typical value of clearance, volume of 
distribution and half-life of osimertinib were estimated as 14.2 L/h, 986 L, and 48 h, respectively. The 
between subject variability for clearance and volume of distribution of osimertinib were estimated as 45.6 
and 51.8 (expressed as % coefficient of variation), respectively. Body weight on apparent clearances of 
osimertinib and AZ5104, bodyweight and baseline albumin on apparent volume of distribution of osimertinib 
and ethnicity on apparent clearance of AZ5104 were identified as significant covariates to explain the 
variability in the data. However, effect of these parameter-covariate relationships did not show any clinical 
meaningful changes in PK exposure metrics. The covariates age, gender, smoking status, renal and hepatic 
function had no impact on PK of osimertinib and its metabolite AZ5104 within the population studied. 
An updated population PK model for osimertinib and AZ5104 was developed based on plasma concentrations 
of osimertinib and AZ5104 from Phase I/II/III studies in NSCLC patients.  
The objective of this analysis was to update the previously developed pharmacokinetic model using 
pharmacokinetic data from the AURA3 (Phase III) study along with AURA (Phase I/II) and AURA2 (Phase II) 
data, including the following aspects: 
  Characterization of the dose/plasma concentration relationship of osimertinib and its main 
metabolite of interest (AZ5104) and the associated between-subject variability in NSCLC patients, 
following oral administration. 
  Re-evaluate the impact of selected intrinsic and extrinsic covariates of interest on the PK variability 
of osimertinib (ethnicity, body weight, gender, age, hepatic markers (ALT, AST and bilirubin), 
baseline albumin levels, creatinine clearance, smoking status, renal and hepatic impairment status). 
  Assessment of the impact of longer duration of treatment on pharmacokinetics of osimertinib. 
Methods: 
Plasma concentration-time data were analyzed using a non-linear mixed effects modelling approach 
(non-linear mixed effects modelling software [NONMEM], version 7.2). Model development was driven by 
data and based on various goodness-of-fit indicators, including visual inspection of diagnostic and covariate 
scatter plots, precision of parameter estimates, and the minimum objective function value.

After identification of the base model, covariates were evaluated using a stepwise covariate model search 
process by backward elimination (P<0.001) following forward inclusion (P<0.01). The significance of a 
covariate effect was also evaluated with respect to clinical and/or physiological relevance. 
The final population PK model was used to obtain individual exposure estimates of osimertinib and AZ5104 
for patients included in the datasets and to simulate an 80-mg steadystate exposure. 
In the previous analysis, a common (combined additive and proportional) error model was applied to 
estimate the residual variability for both osimertinib and its metabolite AZ5104. This residual error model 
was updated considering individual error models (combined additive and proportional) to estimate the 
residual variability for osimertinib and its metabolite AZ5104, separately. These initial changes were applied 
using plasma concentration and covariates information from AURA and AURA2 only. After these initial 
changes, the population PK model consisted the following characteristics and used as a starting point for the 
analysis: 
•Linear 1-compartment model to characterise PK for each analyte 
•First-order absorption of parent into the parent's central compartment 
•Fraction of osimertinib metabolized to AZ5104 was fixed to 0.25 
•Linear elimination from osimertinib (parent) and AZ5104 (metabolite) from their respective 
central compartments 
•Between subject variability was considered on all the PK parameters 
•Correlation of random effects between CL/F and CLM/F was included 
•Error models (combined additive and proportional) to estimate the residual variability for 
osimertinib and its metabolite AZ5104 separately. 
•Model parameters were estimated using SAEM algorithm as implemented in NONMEM 
Results: 
The dataset used for analysis consisted of a total of 31428 plasma concentration samples, obtained from 
1088 subjects, treated with osimertinib. 
The population in AURA3 was fairly similar to the population that was studied in AURA and AURA2. The main 
difference in these populations is that in AURA3 100% of the patients obtained treatment with osimertinib in 
second line, while in AURA and AURA2 only about 24% received osimertinib in second line and the majority 
(69%) in ≥third line. However, in the previous analysis (Comisar, 2015), lines of therapy was not identified 
as a covariate having an influence on the PK of osimertinib. 
AURA3 study showed a slightly lower pre-dose steady-state concentrations (about 21% lower) compared to 
AURA and AURA2 studies. Based on these data based observations, it is expected that the apparent 
clearances are higher in AURA3 than in AURA and AURA2. 
The updated population PK parent and metabolite model was comprised of first order oral absorption of 
osimertinib followed by two compartments in series: one-compartment for osimertinib followed by a 
compartment for AZ5104. The final model described the osimertinib/AZ5104 concentration data well for 
subsequent exposure response modelling purposes. 
The primary predictors of variability in osimertinib and AZ5104 PK were body weight and serum albumin. 
Ethnicity had only a negligible effect on osimertinib and AZ5104 exposure. There were no factors identified 
that would require dose adjustment in patients.

In the final population pharmacokinetic model, the typical (%RSE) value of CL/F and Vz/F are 14.2 (1.67) 
L/h and 997 (3.96) L, which is very similar to the CL/F and Vz/F estimated in the previous model as 14.2 
(1.80) L/h and 986 (2.80) L, respectively.  
The expected typical values of osimertinib AUCss, and Css,max for an 80-mg osimertinib dose in NSCLC 
patients are 11184 nM.h and 509 nM, respectively. The expected typical values of AZ5104 AUCss and 
Css,max for an 80-mg osimertinib dose in NSCLC patients are 1320 nM*h, and 58 nM, respectively.

VPC showed that the final model is adequately able to describe the steady-state pharmacokinetics of 
osimertinib for the totality of the AURA, AURA2, and AURA3 data. 
Based on the covariate/parameter relationships in the final model and the simulation based analysis, the 
following changes in exposure (AUCss) are expected compared to the AUC,ss for a white patient with a 
median bodyweight of 60 kg and a median baseline albumin of 39 g/L: 
  Bodyweight on osimertinib CL/F and V/F: accounts for less than 20% change in osimertinib AUC,ss 
would be expected across a bodyweight range of 43 to 89 kg. 
  Bodyweight on AZ5104 CLm/F: a -29% to +36% change for AZ5104 AUC,ss would be expected 
across a bodyweight range of 43 to 89 kg 
  Baseline albumin on osimertinib CL/F and V/F: a -15% to +30% change in osimertinib AUC,ss would 
be expected across a albumin range of 29 to 46 g/L. 
  Baseline albumin on AZ5104 CLm/F and Vm/F: a -15% to +36% change in AZ5104 AUC,ss would be 
expected across a albumin range of 29 to 46 g/L. 
  For all ethnic classes (Chinese, Japanese, Asian other and non-Asian-non-white), a decrease in 
AZ5104 AUC,ss of 7% to 17% vs white patients may be expected, which is unlikely to have clinically 
relevant impact. 
Changes in exposure due to these covariate-parameter relationship are small and not likely to be clinically 
significant based on the exposure-response relationship of osimertinib and hence, no dose adjustments are 
necessary. 
This updated analysis including PK data from Phase I, Phase II and Phase III studies supports the prior 
conclusions regarding no need for dose adjustment due to age,gender, bodyweight, ethnicity, smoking 
status, mild/moderate/severe renal impairment status and mild/moderate hepatic impairment status.

While the typical subject at 60 kg is predicted to have a median osimertinib Cmax,ss of 509 nM (and an 
AUCss of 11184 nM*hour), a subject with the extreme combination of bodyweight (43 kg) and baseline 
albumin (29 g/L) covariates, is predicted to have an increase in median steady-state Cmax,ss and AUCss of 
approximately 58% and 51%, respectively. This shows that even in extreme and unlikely scenarios, a typical 
subject is expected to have less than 60% change in exposure. 
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships and exposure/response relationships of 
osimertinib 
The previously submitted PK-PD analysis was updated with AURA3 data and the updated results are 
consistent with the previous analysis. Individual values of AUCss from the final population PK model were 
used to assess the PK-PD relationships for efficacy and safety.  
PK-PD relationships are analyzed either as dose-response or exposure response relationships against either 
safety or efficacy outcomes. 
Individual AUCss values from the final population PK model were used to assess PK-PD relationships for 
efficacy and safety. 
Effect of exposure on efficacy outcomes 
Graphical analysis indicated that there was no relationship observed between best percentage change in 
tumour size from baseline or DoR and osimertinib or AZ5104 exposure. Graphical exploration of best overall

response or PFS indicated patients in the high AUCss quartile (AUCss>15690 nM*hr) had a numerically 
shorter PFS than the patients in the lower 3 quartiles; importantly, osimertinib treatment effect was 
significantly greater than the chemotherapy treatment across all quartiles of exposure. Kaplan-Meier plot of 
PFS stratified by quartiles of Osimertinib AUCss and chemotherapy is shown in Figure 11. 
A model-based analysis was conducted to explain the numerically shorter PFS observed with patients in the 
high exposure quartile. This analysis showed a statistically significantassociation of AUCss (exposure) of 
osimertinib/AZ5104 with PFS, indicating an increase inexposure may be associated with a decrease in PFS. 
However, when baseline albumin levels (<39 g/L compared to ≥39 g/L) and the WHO status (WHO≥1 
compared to WHO =0) wereincluded as predictors of PFS, the exposure relationship with osimertinib or 
AZ5104 was no longer statistically significant (Figure 12). This indicated that the reason for numerically 
shorter PFS observed in the high exposure quartile is likely to be a consequence of an excess of patients with 
poor prognostic features in the high exposure quartile and is not related to osimertinib or AZ5104 exposure 
levels. This is consistent from literature (Gupta et al, 2010) which shows that shorter survival time is 
associated with low levels of pre-treatment serum albumin. Additionally, from the population PK analysis 
(Johnson 2016) it is known that baseline albumin levels are positively correlated with apparent clearance of 
both osimertinib and AZ5104. 
These findings of no relationship between efficacy and osimertinib exposure are in agreement with the 
dose-response analysis where there was no clear relationship between dose and efficacy with all doses 
examined (20 to 240 mg) demonstrated clinical activity as indicated in the initial MAA submission in a Dose 
Justification Document.

Effect of exposure on key safety parameters 
An earlier assessment (included in the initial MAA) of the occurrence of classical EGFR TKI toxicities of rash, 
diarrhoea and both rash and diarrhoea in patients from AURA and AURA2 indicated the probability of a 
patient experiencing rash or diarrhoea increased with osimertinib AUCss exposure. AURA3 findings have 
shown that the frequency and severity of the events of rash and diarrhoea were similar to those in the Phase 
II studies and did not increase with increased duration of exposure to osimertinib. In this PK-PD analysis, 
only the effect of osimertinib exposure on ILD (interstitial lung disease) or ILD-like events or on the LVEF 
(left ventricular ejection fraction) changes wereanalyzed. 
The proportion of patients showing ILD or ILD-like events at different osimertinib AUCss quartiles is 
presented in Figure 13 and it shows that the incidence of ILD is related to osimertinib treatment. The data 
indicates that a probability of patient experiencing ILD events are likely to increase with increasing 
osimertinib exposure. 
Figure 14 indicates that at a similar AUCss of osimertinib, patients of Japanese ethnicity tend to have higher 
incidence of ILD compared to Non-Asian and Asian (non-Japanese) patients. 
However, it was noted that the model predicted incidence rate for non-osimertinib or placebo treatment was 
much lower (0.005%) than the ILD incidence rate available in literature for placebo or chemotherapy 
treatment (0.9 to 2%). This indicates that the exposure-ILD model might overestimate the slope of the ILD 
incidence at higher exposure and hence, the estimated magnitude of osimertinib exposure on the probability 
of patient experiencing ILD event is expected to be potentially lower than estimated by the current model.

Initial graphical assessments using minimum or maximum change from baseline LVEF measurement (LVEF 
changes) during the osimertinib treatment did not indicate any quantifiable relationship with osimertinib and 
AZ5104 exposure (Figure 15). However, LVEF event (a 10% absolute change from baseline LVEF along with 
a drop to <50% LVEF) indicated an exposure dependent effect and hence, a model based assessment was 
evaluated to quantify this effect. Models that take into account the rare nature of these events (penalized 
logistic regression and zero-inflated Poisson) were implemented and the model based assessments 
suggested that there was no relationship between exposure and the occurrence of LVEF events at the 
pre-specified statistical significance threshold (p<0.001).

4.2.2.  Discussion 
The updated popPK analysis showed that pharmacokinetics of osimertinib and AZ5104 was similar between 
patients in AURA3 and AURA/AURA2 studies. Lower pre-dose steady-state concentrations (about 21% 
lower) were observed in AURA3 compared to AURA and AURA2 studies. Based on these observations, higher 
apparent clearances are expected in AURA3 than in AURA and AURA2. 
The PPK analysis was based on the one previously developed and was performed using well recognized 
model building techniques. The validity of the final model seems to be overall acceptable. Shrinkage was 
small (≤5%) in clearance parameters, but higher (26–40%) in volume of distribution and absorption rate 
constant ETAs. The applicant justifies that the higher shrinkage in volume of distribution and absorption rate 
constant is expected given the large amount of sparse data taken from the AURA3 trial. Caution is advised 
when interpreting volume of distribution and absorption data. 
The updated population PK parent and metabolite model was comprised of first order oral absorption of 
osimertinib followed by two compartments in series: one-compartment for osimertinib followed by a 
compartment for AZ5104. The final model described the osimertinib/AZ5104 concentration data well for 
subsequent exposure response modelling purposes. 
In the final population pharmacokinetic model, the typical (%RSE) value of CL/F and Vz/F are 14.2 (1.67) 
L/h and 997 (3.96) L. These values  are pretty similar to those estimated in the previously submitted popPK 
analysis. SmPC has been updated accordingly. 
The updated popPK analysis confirms previous findings. There is no impact of age, gender, bodyweight, 
smoking status, mild/moderate/severe renal impairment status and mild/moderate hepatic impairment 
status on the PK of osimertinib and AZ5104. Data regarding patients with severe renal impairment is still 
considered limited (n=5) and the lack of information should be maintained in SmPC. No patients with severe 
hepatic impairment were included in the trials. Ethnicity showed a minor impact on the pharmacokinetics of 
osimertinib and is not considered clinically relevant. 
Regarding body weight, less than 20% change in osimertinib AUCss (compared to the AUCss for the median 
body weight of 60 kg) would be expected across a body weight range of 43 kg to 89. Similar but greater 
change (−15% to +30%) in osimertinib AUCss would be expected across the albumin range of 29 g/L to 46 
Assessment report

Page 16/113 
 
 
  
 
 
g/L (compared to the median baseline albumin of 39 g/L). A −15% to +36% chance in AZ5104 AUCss would 
be expected across the similar range. The magnitude of the observed changes does not justify new 
recommendations on dose adjustment based on body weight or baseline albumin. 
PK-PD analysis has been updated with AURA3 data. Individual values of AUCss from the final population PK 
model were used to assess the PK-PD relationships for efficacy and safety. This includes effect of exposure 
on PFS, on probability of experiencing interstitial lung disease and on experiencing changes of left 
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). 
The exposure-PFS analysis showed that the patients in the highest quartile of osimertinib AUCss showed 
shorter PFS. This finding is however likely to be confounded by disease related factors such as WHO 
performance status or baseline albumin levels (a misbalance was noted between quartile groups). Having 
said that, no exposure-PFS relation can be established. Regarding safety, there appears to be a higher 
probability of experiencing ILD or ILDlike events increased with increasing osimertinib exposure, however 
data are limited and should be interpreted with caution.

Figure 1 Flow chart of study design 
4.3.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
•  Study participants 
Patients aged ≥18 years (≥20 years for patients from Japan) with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC 
(Histologically- or cytologically-documented not amenable to surgery or radiotherapy) who had progressed 
(radiologically) following prior first-line therapy with an approved EGFR-TKI agent. Patients had to have 
EGFR mutation-positive tumours, with centrally-confirmed T790M mutation-positive status.All patients had 
to have measurable dissease at baseline.  
All patients were to have adequate cardiac, hepatic and renal function, World Health Organization (WHO) 
performance status of 0 or 1 with no deterioration over the previous 2 weeks and a minimum life expectancy 
of 12 weeks.Patients with CNS metastases were eligible if they were asymptomatic, stable and not requiring 
steroids for at least 4 weeks prior to start of study treatment. 
Previous treatment with osimertinib or a third generation EGFR-TKI was not premitted (eg. CO-1686). 
• 
  Treatments 
Osimertinib was to be administered orally as a single daily dose of 80 mg.  
Pemetrexed was to be administered at 500 mg/m2 on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle is as per the US and EU 
prescribing Information with either Cisplatin at 75 mg/m2 on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle, or Carboplatin at 
a dose producing an AUC5 on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. Pemetrexed as maintenance therapy was to be 
administered at a dose of 500 mg/m2 on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. 
In the osimertinib arm, patients could continue on treatment as long as they were deriving clinical benefit, 
as judged by the investigator, or until a treatment discontinuation criterion was met.  In the chemotherapy 
arm, patients could receive up to 6 cycles of pemetrexed plus cisplatin or carboplatin as initial treatment.  
Those patients whose disease had not progressed after 4 cycles of platinum-based doublet chemotherapy 
could continue on maintenance monotherapy with pemetrexed according to the approved label use or local 
practice guidelines. Patients who progressed according to RECIST v1.1 prior to completion of the initial 
doublet chemotherapy treatment or during pemetrexed maintenance monotherapy, could continue with 
chemotherapy as long as they showed clinical benefit, as judged by the investigator.   
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/134310/2017 
Page 18/113 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Once patients in the chemotherapy arm were determined to have objective radiological progression 
according to RECIST v1.1 by the investigator, with confirmation by blinded independent central review 
(BICR), they were given the opportunity to begin treatment with osimertinib 80 mg once daily.  These 
patients could continue treatment with osimertinib, as long as they showed clinical benefit, as determined by 
the investigator.  Patients who did not have BICR confirmation of objective disease progression were not 
allowed to cross-over to osimertinib.  If it was considered to be in the patient’s best interest, and only if 
further randomised chemotherapy was warranted, the patient could continue to receive randomised doublet 
chemotherapy (if the initial doublet chemotherapy treatment had not yet been completed) or pemetrexed 
maintenance monotherapy. 
•  Objectives 
Primary Objective: 
To assess the efficacy of osimertinib compared with platinum-based doublet chemotherapy by assessment 
of PFS. 
Secondary Objectives: 
To further assess the efficacy of osimertinib compared with platinum-based doublet chemotherapy in terms 
of ORR, DoR, DCR, tumour shrinkage, and OS; to assess the effect of osimertinib compared to 
platinum-based doublet chemotherapy on subjects' disease-related symptoms and HRQoL; and, to 
characterise the pharmacokinetics (PK) of osimertinib and metabolites in subjects receiving osimertinib. 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
PFS was defined as the time from randomisation until the date of objective disease progression using 
investigator assessment as defined by RECIST v1.1 or death (by any cause in the absence of progression) 
regardless of whether the patient withdrew from randomised therapy or received another anti-cancer 
therapy prior to progression.  
Baseline radiological tumour assessments were to be performed within 28 days before randomisation. 
During the study, scans were to be performed every 6 weeks relative to randomisation until disease 
progression to evaluate the response. Patients were to be assessed according to the intended scanning 
schedule relative to randomisation to prevent the bias in analysis that could occur if 1 treatment group was 
assessed more or less often than the other. 
Patients who had not had progressive disease (PD) or died at the time of analysis were censored at the time 
of the latest date of assessment from their last evaluable RECIST assessment.However, if the patient 
progressed or died after 2 or more missed visits, that patient was censored at the time of the latest evaluable 
RECIST assessment. Any patient who had no evaluable visits or did not have baseline data, was censored at 
0 day unless that patient diedwithin 2 visits of baseline. 
Sensitivity analysis of PFS was planned using BICR assessment of RECIST v1.1. 
Secondary endpoints 
The secondary outcomes variables were ORR, DoR, DCR, tumour shrinkage, QoL and OS, according to 
RECIST 1.1 with sensitivity analysis by BICR.  
Exploratory endpoints 
Effect of osimertinib vs. chemotherapy on post-progression outcomes (time fromrandomisation to second 
progression [PFS2] and time to subsequent anti-cancer treatments) was explored. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/134310/2017 
Page 19/113 
 
 
  
 
 
•  Sample size 
The primary efficacy endpoint was PFS. Per amendment 3 to the protocol (dated 21 March 2016, before PFS 
data cut off), the primary analysis of PFS was to occur when at least 221 progression events had been 
observed out of the 419 patients randomized, which occurred on 15 April 2106. 
With 221 progression events, the study has at least 80% power to show a statisticallysignificant PFS at the 
5% two-sided significance level if the assumed treatment effect was a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.67. This would 
translate into a 3-month improvement on an estimatedmedian PFS of 6 months in the chemotherapy arm, 
assuming PFS is exponentially distributed. 
The smallest treatment difference that would be statistically significant is a PFS HR of 0.76, which translates 
approximately into a 2-month improvement on the estimated median PFS of 6 months in the control arm 
assuming PFS is exponentially distributed. 
For the rationale for change in planned analyses see protocol amendments below. 
• 
  Randomisation 
Suitable patients were centrally randomised to receive either osimertinib 80 mg orally once daily or 
platinum-based doublet chemotherapy (pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 + carboplatin AUC5 or pemetrexed 500 
mg/m2 + cisplatin 75 mg/m2) on Day 1 of every 21-day cycle in a 2:1 ratio (osimertinib: platinum-based 
doublet chemotherapy) using the IVRS/IWRS system.  
Prior to randomisation, the investigational site declared their choice of chemotherapy for that patient in 
IVRS/IWRS. 
Patients were stratified at randomisation based on ethnicity (Asian/Non-Asian). 
•  Blinding (masking) 
The study was open label. 
•  Statistical methods 
The FAS was defined as all randomised patients. The FAS was used for all efficacy and exploratory analyses, 
including the history of CNS disease evaluation. For the CNS BICR analyses, a CNS FAS (cFAS) and a CNS 
evaluable for response (cEFR) were identified. 
The primary analysis of PFS was based on investigator-recorded assessment of disease progression by 
RECIST v1.1. Progression-free survival was analyzed using a log rank test stratified by ethnicity (Asian, 
Non-Asian). A sensitivity analysis by BICR was also performed. Secondary endpoints of ORR, DoR, DCR, and 
tumour shrinkage were analyzed at the time of the primary PFS analysis. 
Interim analyses 
Three analyses of OS will be conducted. The DCO for the first OS analysis was approximately 4 months after 
the PFS DCO of 15 April 2016. A second analysis of OS will be performed when the OS data are 
approximately 50% mature (approximately 205 deaths events). A third analysis of OS will be performed 
when the OS data are approximately 70% mature (approximately 287 deaths events). 
In order to provide strong control of the type I error rate (2-sided 5%), the primary endpoint of PFS and the 
key secondary endpoints of ORR and OS were tested in this sequential order. If any previous analysis in the 
sequence was not statistically significant, the alpha spending could not be transferred to subsequent 
analyses. Since 3 OS analyses were planned, the LanDeMets approach that approximates the O’Brien and 
Assessment report

Fleming spending function were used to maintain strong control of the 2-sided 5% type I error across the 
testing of 3 planned analyses of OS. 
Pre-specified CNS metastases analysis:  
Patients enrolling in AURA3 were permitted to have asymptomatic, stable brain metastases, defined as not 
requiring steroids for 4 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment. Central nervous system metastases were 
assessed by default as non-target lesions (NTLs) for the scope of the study primary and secondary efficacy 
analyses. CNS exploratory analysis was conducted in AURA3 to explore CNS efficacy in 2 subgroups of 
patients.  
The first analysis explored the CNS efficacy of osimertinib vs. chemotherapy in patients identified as having 
measurable and/or non-measurable CNS metastases at baseline. The second analysis explored the efficacy 
of osimertinib vs. chemotherapy in patients with and without a history of CNS metastases as identified by 
the investigator based on screening/baseline brain scans, and medical history of prior surgery and/or 
radiotherapy to CNS metastases.  
Central nervous system ORR was analysed using logistic regression. Results were presented as an OR with 
associated 95% profile likelihood CI. As the predefined CNS metastases analyses were considered 
exploratory, no adjustment was made to the significance level for the statistical testing of the CNS 
metastases efficacy endpoint 
4.3.2.  Results 
•  Participant flow 
A total of 1036 patients were enrolled in the study (ie, signed informed consent and were screened). A total 
of 617 patients failed screening as follows: 
-  Overall, 589/617 (95.5%) patients failed screening because they did not meet eligibility criteria, 14 
(2.3%) died during the screening period, and 14 (2.3%) withdrew consent to participate in the 
study. 
−  Of the 589 patients who did not meet eligibility criteria, 498 (80.7% of all screen failures) did not 
have a centrally-confirmed T790M mutation; 
A total of 419 patients were randomised to treatment in a 2:1 ratio, 279 (66.6%) to osimertinib 80 mg once 
daily and 140 (33.4%) to platinum-based doublet chemotherapy. Four (1%) of the randomised patients, all 
in the chemotherapy group, did not receive treatment: 3 of the 4 patients withdrew consent to participate 
after randomisation (E2809303 E3205301, and E6002303); and 1 patient (E6001301) had deterioration of 
liver function tests (LFTs) before treatment started. Thus a total of 415 patients received study treatment 
(osimertinib, 279; chemotherapy, 136). 
Of the 136 patients in the chemotherapy arm, 42 (30.9%) received pemetrexed plus cisplatin and 94 
(69.1%) received pemetrexed plus carboplatin based on investigator choice. One hundred (73.5%) patients 
completed at least 4 cycles of chemotherapy. Of these, 27 patients stopped pemetrexed and carboplatin or 
cisplatin on the same day or within 1 day; and 73 (53.7%) patients went on to receive pemetrexed 
maintenance monotherapy.  The mean time of pemetrexed maintenance was 3.8 months (sd, 2.73); the 
median time was 3.1 months (range: 0.7-11.7).

  Recruitment 
Patients were randomised to treatment at 126 study centres in 18 countries, including Australia (4), Canada 
(4), China (17), France (5), Germany (6), Hong Kong (5), Hungary (1), Italy (5), Japan (18), South Korea 
(13), Mexico (2), Netherlands (3), Russia (5), Spain (6), Sweden (3), Taiwan (10), the UK (9), and the USA 
(10). No individual country randomised more than 20% of patients. 
243 (58%) patients were recruited in Asia, 46 (11%) in the Americas, and 130 (31%) in Europe and the rest 
of the world.  
The first patient was randomised and dosed on 20 August 2014; the last 2 patients were randomised on 28 
October 2015. The last first dose was administered on 4 November 2015. 
• 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments: 
Two substantial amendments were made to the AURA3 planned analyses. In Amendment 2 to AURA3 clinical 
study protocol (CSP; dated 6 May 2015), the number of patients to be randomised in the study was reduced 
from 610 to 410. Although the primary endpoint was PFS, the study had been initially sized to characterise 
the secondary endpoint of OS and was over-powered for PFS (>95% power to detect a difference in PFS 
assuming the true HR is 0.67 at a 5% two-sided significance level). Due to the introduction of crossover, the 
interpretation of OS was compromised and therefore, the study was re-sized to focus on the primary 
endpoint of PFS, resulting in a sample size reduction. After Amendment 2, the study had 90% power to 
demonstrate a statistically significant PFS assuming the original hypothesised treatment effect of PFS HR of 
0.67 at a 5% two-sided significance level. 
In Amendment 3 (dated 21 March 2016, before the DCO for PFS of 15 April 2016), the Sponsor made a 
reduction in power to detect a statistically significant difference for the primary analysis of PFS from 90% to 
80% (assuming an HR of 0.67 and 5% 2-sided significance level). The decision to change the power was 
based on the compelling results from the Phase II osimertinib monotherapy studies (AURA extension and 
AURA2 [1 May 2015 DCO]), and from a non-randomised, adjusted comparison of efficacy and safety 
outcomes from the pooled Phase II trials (AURA extension and AURA2) with the control arm (standard of 
care [SoC] platinum-based doublet chemotherapy arm [5 May 2014 DCO]) from the IRESSA™ IMPRESS 
study in the subset of patients with EGFR T790M mutation-positive locally-advanced or metastatic NSCLC. 
Based on this indirect adjusted comparison using BICR, the ORR was significantly greater in the osimertinib 
group compared with the SoC group (64.6% vs. 34.8%, respectively, with an OR of 4.76 [95% CI: 2.21, 
10.26; p<0.001). The PFS based on BICR was significantly longer in the osimertinib group compared with 
the SoC group; the HR was 0.28 (95% CI: 0.19, 0.42; p<0.0001), indicating a 72% reduction in risk of 
disease progression or death in the osimertinib group compared with the SoC group. The median PFS was 
9.7 months in the osimertinib group compared with 5.3 months in the SoC group, a 4.4-month improvement 
in median PFS in the osimertinib group compared with the SoC. For OS, the median OS for osimertinib was 
NC; the median OS for the SoC group was 21.7 months. The KM plots were overlapping for the 2 groups; the 
HR was 1.02 (95% CI: 0.39, 2.70; p<0.9654). Data were immature for both osimertinib and SoC, so 
meaningful conclusions on OS data could not be drawn. 
Based on the above, if the assumed treatment effect were still an HR of 0.67 (which translatesto 
approximately 3 months of improvement on an estimated median PFS of 6 months in the control arm 
assuming proportional hazards), then 221 progression events would provide 80% power to demonstrate a 
statistically significant difference in PFS at the 5% two-sided significance level (as compared with the 295 
progression events required for assuring the originally planned 90% power to demonstrate a statistically 
significant PFS for a hypothesised treatment effect of PFS HR of 0.67 at a 5% 2-sided significance level).

Additionally, in order to maximise the maturity of the OS data at the time of the first analysis, the DCO for 
the first OS analysis was to be performed approximately 4 months after the DCO for the primary PFS analysis 
(OS DCO: 2 September 2016). At the time of the primary PFS analysis, a summary of the frequency of 
deaths and primary cause of death were provided for safety purposes, and no additional summaries or 
analyses were performed in order to protect the integrity of the first OS analysis. 
The approach to control the overall Type I error at 5% (two-sided) over 3 OS analyses was modified to the 
LanDeMets approach that approximates the O’Brien and Fleming spending function. 
No interim clinical outcome analyses were conducted prior to the PFS DCO whenAmendments 2 and 3 to the 
statistical analyses were introduced by the Sponsor. Thus the amendments protected the integrity of the 
study and are considered to be reasonable and constitute a sound approach to the interpretation of the 
results. 
Protocol deviations: 
Important protocol deviations that occurred during the study are summarised in Table 15. One hundred and 
six (25.3%) patients had at least 1 important protocol deviation, with a similar proportion of patients with at 
least 1 important protocol deviation in each arm: 67 (24.0%) patients in the osimertinib arm and 39 
(27.9%) patients in the chemotherapy arm (Table 15). In general, within each category of protocol 
deviations, the treatment groups were also balanced. 
1 additional patient in the osimertinib arm (E1308307 who is not reported in Table 15) was randomised with 
screening AST and ALT values above the 2.5 x ULN threshold and was therefore considered to be a protocol 
violator as there was no evidence the patient fulfilled all entry criteria (Appendix 12.2.8.2). However, 
subsequent communication from the site confirmed that further clinical chemistry tests performed the day 
before randomisation showed AST and ALT values below the 2.5 x ULN threshold, which were not reported 
in the study database; thus the patient was in fact eligible (data on file).

Important protocol deviations that could potentially affect the primary efficacy analysis of PFS were as 
follows: 
• 
Two patients in the osimertinib arm (E1301316 and E6004307) were identified as having protocol 
deviations due to ‘no documentation of any EGFR TKI sensitising mutation at any time since the initial 
diagnosis of NSCLC.’ In both situations, an exon 19 deletion mutation was identified from the initial 
diagnostic biopsy before the date of the histopathological diagnosis of NSCLC being confirmed from the 
same biopsy. As both mutation result and histopathological diagnosis were obtained from the same 
sample, this technical protocol deviation does not impact the assessment of efficacy of osimertinib in 
either patient. 
•  Six patients (1.4%) did not have centrally confirmed T790M mutation-positive status (Table 15). Of these 
6 patients: 
−  2 patients in the osimertinib arm (E4319311 and E6004307) were reported as having missing 
results but were T790M mutation-positive: E4319311 had a T790M positive result recorded under 
the patient’s previous Ecode; and E6004307 had a positive T790M result recorded on the laboratory 
report, which was missing from the database by error. No plasma T790M status for these patients 
was available: E4319311 did not provide a ctDNAplasma sample and E6004307 had insufficient 
plasma for testing. 
− 
In addition, Patient E7803301 (chemotherapy arm) is listed as negative as this patient appeared to 
have had the tumour sample taken after the date of randomisation and was thus not considered as 
having centrally-confirmed T790M prior to randomisation in the database. However, subsequent 
communication from the site confirmed the year of sample collection was incorrectly recorded in the 
study database (2015 instead of 2014), and therefore the patient was T790M positive prior to 
randomisation (data on file). The ctDNA plasma sample from this patient was negative for T790M. 
−  Therefore, 3 patients (2 in the osimertinib arm [E0303304 and E1005310] and 1 in the 
chemotherapy arm [E5001301]) were tumour T790M negative and were randomised in error. 
Results from ctDNA plasma samples were positive for E0303304, negative for E1005301, and 
negative for E5001301.

• 
Two patients (E0303303 and E6204310), both in the osimertinib arm, had their baseline RECIST scan 
assessment more than 28 days before randomisation (32 days prior to randomisation for E0303303 and 
42 days prior to randomisation for E6204301) (Table 15). 
•  Sixteen patients had more than 1 prior line of therapy (10 [3.6%] in the osimertinib arm and 6 [4.3%] 
in the chemotherapy arm): 15 patients had 2 prior lines of therapy and 1 patient had 3 prior lines of 
therapy. Reasons why patients were classified as having received more than 1 prior line of therapy 
included: administration of adjuvant or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy less than 6 months prior to the 
start of the EGFR-TKI therapy; the sequential administration of more than 1 EGFR-TKI agent (changing 
from first-generation to second-generation EGFRTKI, or the restart of EGFR-TKI after more than 12 
months off-treatment); or the addition of anti-cancer agents such as cytotoxic chemotherapy or cMet 
monoclonal antibody towards the end of the prior monotherapy EGFR-TKI regimen. For the latter 2 
examples, although the reason for sequential EGFR-TKI administration or addition of a subsequent 
agent onto the EGFR-TKI could not be confirmed as due to clinical suspicion of impending disease 
progression, the most cautious approach was taken and these examples were classified as being a 
second prior-treatment regimen. 
• 
• 
The proportion of patients with RECIST scans performed outside of the protocol schedule (±1-week 
window) on more than 2 occasions was low and balanced between arms (5% in the osimertinib arm and 
5.7% in the chemotherapy arm). 
Four patients, all in the chemotherapy arm, were randomised but did not receive treatment (Table 15). 
Concomitant treatment  
Overall, 34 (8.1%) patients received concomitant anti-cancer therapies (including radiotherapy) during the 
study, with a greater proportion in the chemotherapy arm (16 [11.4%] patients) compared to the 
osimertinib arm (18 [6.5%] patients). 
Radiotherapy while on treatment was administered to 17 (6.1%) patients in the osimertinib arm vs. 14 
(10.0%) patients in the chemotherapy arm. On-study radiotherapy was only allowed for palliation of painful 
bone metastases. 
Three patients were reported as receiving concomitant anti-cancer therapy during the study. 
• 
Two patients received concomitant chemotherapy: 
- 
Patient E1002327 (chemotherapy arm) had a >2-week interruptionbetween chemotherapy cycles 
and was classified as having discontinuedchemotherapy, but received 1 further cycle of 
chemotherapy beforecrossing over to osimertinib after disease progression. 
- 
Patient E1314303 (osimertinib arm) received therapy with cisplatin,pemetrexed, and bevacizumab 
starting on 9-Nov-2015, but onlypermanently discontinued osimertinib on 16-Nov-2015. 
•  One additional patient (E6208302 in the chemotherapy arm) who startedchemotherapy on 
16-Jul-2015, was randomised while still receiving first-lineEGFR-TKI, received the last dose of 
EGFR-TKI on 5-Jul-2015, and wasconsequently reported on the “on-study treatment” case report 
form (CRF) in thestudy database. 
One osimertinib patient (E1301316) received a disallowed concomitant medication (carbamazepine), which 
was discontinued only 8 days prior to randomisation, a shorter withdrawal period than the 3-week mandated 
by the protocol. 
The vast majority of patients (408 [97.4%] overall; osimertinib: 270 [96.8%]; chemotherapy: 138 
[98.6%]) received allowed concomitant medications during the study.Concomitant medications were

generally representative of medications commonly administered to patients with advanced NSCLC and were 
not considered to affect the study results. 
• 
In the osimertinib arm, the most common types of concomitant medications administered during the 
study (at least 30% of patients), by  ATC class, were Anilides (36.2%; mostly paracetamol [34.4%]) 
and Glucocorticoids (31.5%, including dexamethasone [20.1%]). 
• 
In the chemotherapy arm: 
- 
In line with prescribing recommendations for pemetrexed toxicity management, 91 (65%) patients 
received folic acid and derivatives compounds, (including folic acid, 89 [63.6%]), 111 (79.3%) 
patients received Vitamin B12 (cyanocobolamin and analogues), and 31 (22.1%) received 
Multivitamins plain (Vitamins NOS) (Table 11.1.14.2). Similarly, 125 (89.3%) patients received 
Glucocorticoids, which were mostly dexamethasone (112 [80%]) and dexamethasone sodium 
phosphate (24 [17.1%]). 
• 
The most common ATC types of other concomitant medications administered during the study (at 
least 30% of patients) were Serotonin (5HT3) antagonists (80.0%, the most frequent of which 
were ondansetron [25.0%], palonosetron hydrochloride [15.7%], ondansetron hydrochloride 
[15.0%], and granisetron [15.0%]); Proton pump inhibitors (45.7%, the most frequent of which 
were lansoprazole [12.1%], esomeprazole magnesium [10.7%], and omeprazole [9.3%]); 
Propulsives (45.0%, mostly metoclopramide [36.4%]); Other antiemetics (41.4%, including 
Aprepitant [33.6%]); Anilides (30.7%, mostly paracetamol [29.3%]); and Osmotically acting 
laxatives (30.7%, including magnesium oxide [15.7%]). 
The pattern of concomitant medications was as anticipated for patients with advanced NSCLC receiving 
these categories of anti-cancer agents (ie, EGFR-TKI and platinum-based doublet chemotherapy). 
Treatment compliance 
One (0.4%) patient in the osimertinib arm (E1314303) was withdrawn from the study due to severe 
non-compliance to treatment. The patient received platinum-based chemotherapy and bevacizumab during 
treatment with osimertinib, which was contraindication per protocol. 
• 
Baseline data 
At study entry, the median age of the 419 patients randomised to treatment was 62.0 years (range: 20-90); 
64 (15.3%) patients were ≥75 years in age. The treatment groups were well balanced with regard to age, 
with a median of 62.0 years (range: 25-85 years) in the osimertinib arm and 63.0 years (range: 20-90 
years) in the chemotherapy arm. 
The majority of patients were female (269 [64.2%] patients). There was a slightly greater proportion of 
female patients in the chemotherapy arm than in the osimertinib arm (osimertinib, 172 [61.6%]; 
chemotherapy, 97 [69.3%]). 
The treatment groups were well balanced with regard to race. Nearly two-thirds of patients (65.4%) were of 
Asian racial origin; the remainder of patients were mainly White. 
The treatment arms were well balanced with regard to smoking status. Most patients (67.5%) had never 
smoked . The remainder were mainly former smokers (27.2%). Only 5.3% patients were current smokers.

Disease characteristics 
All 419 randomised patients had locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC and 413 (98.6%) had central 
confirmation of the T790M mutation-positive status of their tumours (Table 18). 
6 patients (4 on osimertinib and 2 on chemotherapy) did not have central confirmation their tumours were 
T790M mutation-positive in the study database, although 3 of the 6 patients (2 in the osimertinib arm and 
1 in the chemotherapy arm) were subsequently found to be tumour T790M mutation-positive. Thus 416 
patients had T790M mutation-positive tumours at randomisation. One of the 3 patients who was tumour 
T790M negative had a positive plasma ctDNA T790M status. 
Per protocol, all patients were to be in second-line therapy. The vast majority of patients (88.8% were in 
second-line therapy after having progressed on a single regimen of EGFR-TKI prior to enrollment. Fifteen 
(3.6%) patients overall (osimertinib, 9 [3.2%]; chemotherapy, 6 [4.3%]) had received 2 prior anti-cancer 
regimen at study entry; and 1 (0.2%) patient in the osimertinib arm had received 3 prior regimens prior to 
study entry. 
Baseline disease characteristics were generally well balanced in the 2 treatment arms (Table 18). 
• 
• 
• 
The majority of patients had metastatic NSCLC (96.4).  
The most common NSCLC histological type was adenocarcinoma (98.6% patients overall). 3 
patients (1.1%), all in the osimertinib arm, had squamous cell carcinoma. All 3 patients were 
ongoing in the study at DCO after 180 days, 199 days, and 297 days, respectively, with a best 
objective response of SD, PR, and PR, respectively. 
The most common EGFR sensitising mutations based on Roche cobas® EGFR Mutation Test were 
exon 19 deletion (278 [66.3%] patients overall; osimertinib, 191 [68.5%]; chemotherapy, 87 
[62.1%]) and exon 21 L858R (128 [30.5%] overall; osimertinib, 83 [29.7%]; chemotherapy, 45 
[32.1%]). The proportion of patients with exon 19 deletion was slightly higher in the osimertinib arm 
than in the chemotherapy arm (Table 18). 
•  A total of 144 (34.4%) patients (osimertinib, 93 [33.3%]; chemotherapy, 51 [36.4%]) had CNS 
metastases at baseline, with the patients identified on the study level FAS by CNS lesion site at 
baseline, medical history, and/or prior surgery, and/or radiotherapy to CNS metastases (Table 18). 
•  Over half of the patients had extra-thoracic visceral metastases at baseline (225 [53.7%] patients 
overall). The proportion of patients with visceral metastases was slightly lower in the osimertinib 
arm (145 [52.0%]) than in the chemotherapy arm (80 [57.1%]) (Table 18). Similarly, the 
proportion of patients with liver metastases (including patients with locally advanced and/or 
metastatic disease, with a site of disease recorded as “Liver” or “Hepatic [including gallbladder]) was 
lower in the osimertinib arm (56 [20.1%]) than in the chemotherapy arm (41 [29.3%]) (Table 
IMT0346). 
•  A smaller proportion of patients had bone/locomotor metastatic disease in the osimertinib arm (105 
[37.6%] patients) than in the chemotherapy arm (68 [48.6%]) (Table 11.1.10). Please note: As 
recorded in the CRF, 3 further patient shad bone/locomotor metastases reported as a 
locally-advanced site of NSCLC. 
• 
The mean tumour burden (TL size) at baseline was 55.1 mm (standard deviation [sd], 33.92) overall 
and well balanced between treatment arms (55.2 mm [sd, 34.04] in the osimertinib arm vs. 54.9 
mm [sd, 33.79] in the chemotherapy arm) (Table 18). 
•  Most patients had a WHO performance status of 1 (261 [62.3%] patients overall; osimertinib, 177 
[63.4%]; chemotherapy, 84 [60.0%]) (Table 18).

Prior anti-cancer therapy 
Per protocol, all randomised patients were to have received only 1 prior line of treatment with an EGFR-TKI 
for advanced NSCLC and were to be in second-line therapy. All patients had received prior EGFR-TKI 
therapy. 
Of the 419 randomised patients, 403 (96.2%) had received only 1 prior EGFR-TKI as per protocol, including 
269 (96.4%) patients in the osimertinib arm and 134 (95.7%) in the chemotherapy arm (Table 19). As

described in the protocol deviations section (Section 6.2), 16 (3.8%) patients overall (osimertinib, 10 
[3.6%]; chemotherapy, 6 [4.3%]) had received more than 1 prior anti-cancer regimen at study entry (Table 
19); 15 patients had received 2 prior lines of therapy and 1 (0.2% overall) patient in the osimertinib arm had 
received 3 prior regimens prior to study entry. Reasons why patients were classified as having received more 
than 1 prior line of therapy included: administration of adjuvant or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy less than 6 
months prior to the start of the EGFR-TKI therapy; the sequential administration of more than 1 EGFR-TKI 
agent (changing from first-generation to second generation EGFR-TKI, or the restart of EGFR-TKI after more 
than 12 months off-treatment); or the addition of anti-cancer agents such as cytotoxic chemotherapy or 
cMet monoclonal antibody towards the end of the prior monotherapy EGFR-TKI regimen. For the latter 2 
examples, although the reason for sequential EGFR-TKI administration or addition of a subsequent agent 
onto the EGFR-TKI could not be confirmed as due to clinical suspicion of impending disease progression, the 
most cautious approach was taken and these examples were classified as being a second prior-treatment 
regimen. In addition, 1 patient started first line EGFR-TKI therapy in combination with bevacizumab on the 
same day and was counted as receiving a single regimen. 
The treatment arms were well-balanced with regard to prior anti-cancer therapy (Table 19). 
•  Approximately two-third of patients overall (253 [60.4%]) had received prior treatment with 
gefitinib (osimertinib, 166 [59.5%]; chemotherapy, 87 [62.1%]). The second most frequently 
administered prior EGFR-TKI was erlotinib(145 [34.6%] patients overall; osimertinib, 96 [34.4%], 
chemotherapy, 49 [35.0%]). Twenty-four (5.7%) patients had received prior afatinib, the majority 
of which were in the osimertinib arm (20 [7.2%] compared to 4 [2.9%] patients in the 
chemotherapy arm). One patient in the chemotherapy arm (E6208302) was excluded from the prior 
EGFR-TKI summary in Table 19 because she was still receiving gefitinib for 3 days after 
randomisation (but stopped gefitinib 10 days before starting chemotherapy); thus this patient was 
reported as receiving concomitant anti-cancer therapy rather than prior EGFR-TKI. 
• 
The mean time between the most recent disease progression and randomisation in the study was 
71.1 days (sd, 54.78) overall and was well balanced between treatment arms (71.3 days [sd, 55.34] 
in the osimertinib arm and 70.7 days [sd, 53.85) in the chemotherapy arm (Table 11.1.8). The 
median time was 58.0 days (osimertinib, 60.0 days; chemotherapy, 55.0 days) and ranged from 3 
days to 550 days (osimertinib, 3-550; chemotherapy, 15-344). The extreme outlying patients with 
the longest duration in both treatment arms were due to the date of first diagnosis being reported in 
error instead of the most recent disease progression. The extreme outlying patients with the 
shortest duration were due to further disease progression being reported from the baseline RECIST 
scan performed during the screening period. 
• 
The duration of the prior EGFR-TKI therapy was ≥6 months in the vast majority of patients (395 
[94.3%] overall), including 262 (93.9%) patients in the osimertinib arm 133 (95.0) patients in the 
chemotherapy arm (Table 19). 
•  Approximately one-third of patients overall (139 [33.2%]) had received prior radiotherapy before 
study entry, including 90 (32.3%) in the osimertinib arm and 49 (35.0%) in the chemotherapy arm. 
• 
Thirty-five (8.4%) patients overall had received prior adjuvant/neo-adjuvant therapy completed at 
least 6 months prior to the start of the EGFR-TKI agent (osimertinib:25 [9.0%]; chemotherapy: 10 
[7.1%]) (Table 19).

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy analysis: PFS based on investigator assessment 
At the DCO for the primary analysis of PFS (15 April 2016), There was a statistically significant (p-value 
<0.001; Table 12) and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS for patients on osimertinib compared to 
patients on chemotherapy.  The HR was 0.30 (95% CI: 0.23, 0.41), indicating a 70% reduction in the risk of 
disease progression or death in the absence of RECIST progression in the osimertinib arm compared to the 
chemotherapy arm.

The median PFS of 10.1 months (95% CI: 8.3, 12.3) in the osimertinib arm compared to 4.4 months (95% 
CI: 4.2, 5.6) in the chemotherapy arm indicated a clinically meaningful 5.7-month improvement in median 
PFS in favour of osimertinib.

Progression events that did not occur within 14 weeks of the last evaluable assessment (or randomisation) were censored and therefore excluded 
in the number of events.. 
Data cut-off: 15 April 2016. 
At the DCO, 250 patients had progressed based on investigator assessment or died in the absence of 
progression (59.7% maturity); data had an appropriate maturity for the analysis to be meaningful (Table 
12).  The statistical design requirements for the study were met as the number of PFS events provided 
adequate power (at least 80%) to detect the PFS HR (0.67) the study was designed for assuming a 2-sided 
type-I error of 5% level.  
A smaller proportion of patients had a progression event or died without RECIST progression in the 
osimertinib arm (140 patients; 50.2%) compared to the chemotherapy arm (110 patients; 78.6%). 
Most of the progression events were due to progression by RECIST criteria (osimertinib, 129/140 events 
[92.1%]; chemotherapy 104/110 events [94.5%]).  Fewer patients had progression in Non-target lesion 
(NTLs) and new lesion (NLs) in the osimertinib arm compared to chemotherapy (osimertinib: 27 [9.7%] and 
72 [25.8%], respectively; chemotherapy: 47 [33.6%] and 61 [43.6%]).  The number of deaths without 
RECIST progression was similar between treatment arms (osimertinib: 11 [3.9%] patients; chemotherapy: 
6 [4.3%] patients). 
The median follow-up for censored patients was longer in the osimertinib arm (8.4 months) than in the 
chemotherapy arm (5.5 months). This is likely to be driven by the greater number of patients in the 
chemotherapy arm that were censored at Day 1 (10 patients in the chemotherapy arm vs. 1 patient in the 
osimertinib arm).  Further, the median follow-up for censored patients was 8.0 months in the chemotherapy 
arm compared to 8.4 months in the osimertinib arm when these 11 patients are excluded. 
Based on a KM analysis of PFS by BICR, the estimated proportion of patients alive and progression-free at 6 
months was 68.8% (95% CI: 62.9, 74.0) in the osimertinib arm vs. 36.9% (95% CI: 28.5, 45.3) in the 
chemotherapy arm, and at 12 months was 44.0% (95% CI: 36.9, 50.9) in the osimertinib arm vs. 9.8% 
(95% CI: 4.9, 16.9) in the chemotherapy arm (Table 13 and Figure 4).  There was a clear separation of the 
KM curves in favour of osimertinib for the duration of the study.

Sensitivity analyses of PFS did not indicate any evidence of evaluation time bias (which could occur if scans 
were not performed at the protocol-scheduled time points). The HR in this analysis (0.29 [95% CI: 0.22, 
0.40]) was consistent with the primary analysis.  A sensitivity analysis to evaluate attrition bias indicated 
that the censoring rules applied did not affect the outcome of the primary analysis (HR: 0.30 [95% CI: 0.22, 
0.40]). 
There was no evidence of a lack of proportional hazards from the plot of log-log (PFS survivor function) vs. 
log (PFS time) by investigator assessment.  The median number of days between RECIST assessments by 
investigator was similar in both treatment arms (41.8 days [range: 9 to 56] in the osimertinib arm and 42.0 
days [range: 13 to 74] in the chemotherapy arm).  There was no evidence of a difference in frequency of 
RECIST assessments between treatment groups. 
At the PFS DCO of 15 April 2016, 73 (26.2%) of the 279 patients on osimertinib had NLs based on 
investigator assessment compared to 63 of 140 (45.0%) those on chemotherapy.  The proportional 
difference in incidence of NLs between treatment arms was mostly driven by NLs in the chemotherapy arm 
compared to the osimertinib arm in the CNS (14.3% vs. 4.7%, respectively) and in the lung (17.9% vs. 
8.6%, respectively). 
The BICR assessment of NLs was generally consistent with the investigator, with 78 (28.0%) patients with 
NLs in the osimertinib arm compared to 53 (37.9%) in the chemotherapy arm. 
Progression-free survival by BICR (sensitivity analysis) 
The analysis of PFS by BICR on the FAS was performed as a sensitivity analysis, and was consistent with the 
investigator-based analysis (HR: 0.28, 95% CI: 0.20, 0.38; p<0.001) (Table 12 and Table 13) indicating a 
72% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death in absence of RECIST progression in the 
osimertinib group compared to the chemotherapy group.  Median PFS was comparable between analyses 
(osimertinib: 10.1 months by investigator assessment vs. 11.0 months by BICR; chemotherapy: 4.4 months 
by investigator vs 4.2 months by BICR), indicating a 6.8 month improvement in median PFS by BICR. 
Based on a KM analysis, the estimated proportion of patients alive and progression-free at 6 months was 
69.6% (95% CI: 63.6, 74.8) in the osimertinib arm vs. 34.1% (95% CI: 25.8, 42.5) in the chemotherapy 
arm and at 12 months was 46.9% (95% CI: 39.1, 54.4) in the osimertinib arm vs. 11.3% (95% CI: 5.6, 
19.1) in the chemotherapy arm.  There was a clear separation of the KM curves in favour of osimertinib for 
the entire duration of the follow-up (Figure 5). 
The overall concordance between the BICR and investigator-assessed disease progression was 82.6%.  
There was disagreement in the assessment of disease progression status for 73 patients (Table 14).   
The concordance was 77.8% in the osimertinib arm, with disagreement for 62 patients.  The concordance 
was 92.1% in the chemotherapy arm, with disagreement for 11 patients.  The difference in concordance 
between treatment arms may be due in part to the mandatory BICR confirmatory review of scans at the time 
of disease progression for chemotherapy patients before cross-over to osimertinib was allowed.  Comparison 
of the BICR and investigator-assessed date of progression demonstrated that most of the discordant PD 
dates were recorded earlier by BICR than by investigator (osimertinib: 44.3% [based on 43/97 patients]; 
chemotherapy: 32.7% [based on 33/101 patients]).  There was a consistent selection of TLs and NTLs 
between the BICR radiologists and investigator.

Secondary efficacy variables 
•  Secondary efficacy variable of overall survival 
At the PFS DCO of 15 April 2016, no formal analysis of OS had been performed; as per the CSP, the DCO for 
the first OS analysis occurred on 2 September 2016, approximately 4 months after the PFS DCO of 15 April 
2016.  Data for the first OS analysis will be provided as part of the RSI responses and are not included 
herein. 
As no formal analysis was performed, only a summary of death events was provided.  Overall there were 61 
(14.6%) deaths (35 [12.5%] in the osimertinib arm vs. 26 [18.6%] in the chemotherapy arm). 
As stated previously, 3 analyses of OS will be conducted.  A second analysis of OS will be performed when 
the OS data are approximately 50% mature (approximately 205 deaths events).  A third analysis of OS will 
be performed when the OS data are approximately 70% mature (approximately 287 deaths events).

•  Objective response rate by investigator assessment 
There was a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in ORR for patients in the 
osimertinib arm compared to those on chemotherapy, with patients approximately five times more likely to 
respond to osimertinib compared to chemotherapy based on investigator assessment: the OR was 5.39 
(95% CI: 3.47, 8.48) (p-value: <0.001) (Table 15).  The ORR (unadjusted) by investigator assessment was 
70.6% (95% CI: 64.9, 75.9) in the osimertinib arm and 31.4% (95% CI: 23.9, 39.8) in the chemotherapy 
arm. 
The BORs based on investigator assessment included 4 (1.4%) patients with CRs and 193 (69.2%) patients 
with PRs in the osimertinib arm vs. 2 (1.4%) patients with CR and 42 (30.0%) with PR in the chemotherapy 
arm (Table 16).  A smaller proportion of patients in the osimertinib arm had a BOR of SD≥6 weeks (63 
[22.6%] patients, compared to 60 [42.9%] patients in the chemotherapy arm).  This is due to the higher 
incidence of patients with CR and PR in the osimertinib arm. 
The ORR based on BICR analysis of the FAS was consistent with that based on the investigator assessment 
(Table 15 and Table 16), with an improvement in ORR for patients on osimertinib compared to those on 
chemotherapy (OR: 3.63 [95% CI: 2.37, 5.64], p-value: <0.001).  The ORR (unadjusted) based on BICR 
was 64.9% (95% CI: 59.0, 70.5) in the osimertinib arm and 34.3% (95% CI: 25.6, 42.8) in the 
chemotherapy arm. 
Based on assessment by BICR, 3 (1.1%) patients had a CR and 178 (63.8%) had a PR in the osimertinib arm 
vs. none with CRs and 48 (34.3%) with PR in the chemotherapy arm (Table 11.2.4.1.2 of the AURA3 CSR in 
Module 5.3.5.1).  
The ORR based on BICR was 64.9% (95% CI: 59.0, 70.5) in the osimertinib arm and 34.3% (95% CI: 25.6, 
42.8) in the chemotherapy arm.

•  Duration of response by investigator assessment 
At DCO, duration of response was longer in patients on osimertinib compared to those on chemotherapy.  
The median DoR based on investigator assessment (by KM analysis) was 9.7 months (95% CI: 8.3, 11.6; 
44.7% maturity) in the osimertinib arm vs. 4.1 months (95% CI: 3.0, 5.6; 81.8% maturity) in the 
chemotherapy arm, with a difference of over 5 months (Table 17).  There was a statistically significant 
improvement in EDoR for patients on osimertinib compared to those on chemotherapy (ratio of EDoR: 6.22; 
95% CI: 4.04, 9.57; p-value: <0.001; calculated according to the formulae provided in Ellis et al 2008), with 
a mean DoR of 15.4 months for patients on osimertinib vs. 5.6 months for those on chemotherapy (Table 
18).

Based on a KM analysis, the estimated proportion of patients remaining in response at 6 months was 70.1% 
(95% CI: 62.8, 76.3) in the osimertinib arm vs. 30.2% (95% CI: 17.2, 44.2) in the chemotherapy arm, and 
at 9 months was 53.0% (95% CI: 44.5, 60.9) in the osimertinib arm vs. 15.7% (95% CI: 6.2, 29.1) in the 
chemotherapy arm (Table 17).  There was a clear separation of KM curves in favour of osimertinib from 3 
months onwards (Figure 6). 
Figure 3 
Duration of response in AURA3 by investigator assessment, Kaplan-Meier plot 
(FAS) 
Patients with missing censoring information were not included.  Duration of response is the time from the first documentation of CR/PR until the date of 
progression or the last evaluable RECIST assessment for patients who do not progress. 
At DCO, 88 of the 197 responders (44.7% maturity) had progressed or died in the absence of progression in 
the osimertinib arm vs. 36 of the 44 responders (81.8% maturity) in the chemotherapy arm. 
The median time to onset of objective response from randomisation was 6.1 weeks (95% CI: NC, NC) in the 
osimertinib arm vs. 6.4 weeks (95%CI: 6.3, 7.0) in the chemotherapy arm (Table 17), reflecting the timing 
of the first scan at 6 weeks.  Most responders (161 [81.7%] patients in the osimertinib arm and 29 [65.9%] 
in the chemotherapy arm) had a first documented objective response at their first scheduled follow-up 
RECIST scan (ie, at Week 6±1 week).  Almost all responders in both treatment arms (osimertinib, 187 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/134310/2017 
Page 41/113 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
[94.9%]; chemotherapy, 39 [88.6%]) responded by their second scheduled follow-up RECIST scan (Week 
12±1 week).  The onset of response at the first scan was similar in both treatment arms, with a median time 
to onset of objective response from randomisation of 6.1 weeks (95% CI: NC, NC) in the osimertinib arm vs. 
6.4 weeks (95% CI: 6.3, 7.0) in the chemotherapy arm. However, some of the chemotherapy responses 
were not maintained and were generally less durable, as evidenced by the median DoR (4.1 months) and 
estimated percentage of patients remaining in response at 9 and 12 months (15.7% [95% CI: 6.2, 29.1] and 
10.5% [95% CI: 2.5, 24.9], respectively, in the chemotherapy arm vs. 53.0% [95% CI: 44.5, 60.9] and 
37.8% [95% CI: 28.1, 47.5] in the osimertinib arm). 
The DoR per BICR was consistent with the investigator assessment.  The median DoR based on BICR was 
11.2 months (95% CI: 8.3, NC) in the osimertinib arm vs. 3.1 months (95% CI: 2.9, 4.3) in the 
chemotherapy arm.   
Based on a KM analysis, the estimated proportion of patients remaining in response at 6 months was 71.4% 
(95% CI: 63.3, 78.0) in the osimertinib arm vs. 25.6% (95% CI: 13.8, 39.1) in the chemotherapy arm; and 
at 9 months was 53.5% (95% CI: 43.5, 62.5) in the osimertinib arm vs. 14.6% (95% CI: 5.3, 28.4) in the 
chemotherapy arm (Table 19).  There was a clear separation of the KM curves after 3 months. 
•  Disease control rate by investigator assessment 
There was a statistically significant improvement in DCR for patients on osimertinib compared to those on 
chemotherapy, with an OR of 4.76 (95% CI: 2.64, 8.84) (p-value: <0.001) (Table 20).  The DCR (defined as 
CR+PR+SD≥6 weeks) based on investigator assessment was 93.2% (95% CI: 89.6, 95.9) in the osimertinib 
arm vs. 74.3% (95% CI: 66.2, 81.3) in the chemotherapy arm.

The DCR based on BICR was consistent with DCR findings by investigator assessment.  The DCR based on 
BICR assessment was 91.8% (95% CI: 87.9, 94.7) in the osimertinib arm vs. 72.9% (95% CI: 64.7, 80.0) 
in the chemotherapy arm.  
• 
Tumour shrinkage 
Overall, 278/279 (99.6%) patients in the osimertinib arm and 131/140 (93.6%) patients in the 
chemotherapy arm had baseline and on-treatment tumour measurements.  A greater proportion of patients 
had tumour shrinkage in the osimertinib arm compared to the chemotherapy arm (257 [92.4%] patients vs. 
103 [78.6%] patients, respectively; Figure 8 [osimertinib arm] and Figure 9 [chemotherapy arm]). 
There was a statistically significant difference in tumour shrinkage between treatment arms, with a greater 
mean percentage tumour shrinkage from baseline in patients on osimertinib (Table 21).  The unadjusted 
mean tumour shrinkage was -46.1% (sd, 29.50) in the osimertinib arm vs. -24.4% (sd, 29.27) in the 
chemotherapy arm (difference in least square [LS] means between the treatment arms: -21.62; 95% CI:

-27.71, -15.52; p-value: <0.001).  In both treatment arms, evidence of tumour shrinkage was usually 
documented at the first scheduled follow-up RECIST scan, at Week 6±1 week.

Patient-reported outcomes: lung cancer symptoms and health-related quality of life 
The compliance to the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-LC13 was high up to approximately 54 weeks of treatment. 
PRO primary analysis (MMRM) 
The primary analyses for patient-reported outcomes was performed using mixed model for repeated 
measures (MMRM) analyses of change from baseline over the overall time period from randomisation 
until 6 months in 5 key lung cancer symptoms (dyspnoea, appetite loss, fatigue, cough and pain in chest).   
Osimertinib improved patient-reported lung cancer symptoms compared to chemotherapy by demonstrating 
a statistically significant difference in mean change from baseline vs. chemotherapy for all 5 pre-specified 
primary PRO symptoms.   
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The adjusted mean change from baseline during the overall time period from randomisation until 
6 months for cough showed an improvement of −12.22 in the osimertinib arm vs. an improvement 
of −6.69 in the chemotherapy arm (estimated difference: −5.53 [95% CI: −8.89, −2.17]; 
p-value=0.001). 
The adjusted mean change from baseline during the overall time period from randomisation until 
6 months for dyspnoea showed an improvement of −5.61 in the osimertinib arm vs. a deterioration 
of 1.48 in the chemotherapy arm (estimated difference: −7.09 [95% CI: −9.86, −4.33]; p-value 
<0.001).  
The adjusted mean change from baseline during the overall time period from randomisation until 
6 months for pain in chest showed an improvement of −5.15 in the osimertinib arm vs. a 
deterioration of 0.22 in the chemotherapy arm (estimated difference: −5.36 [95% CI: −8.20, 
−2.53]; p-value <0.001). 
The adjusted mean change from baseline during the overall time period from randomisation until 
6 months for fatigue showed an improvement of −5.68 in the osimertinib arm vs. a deterioration of 
4.71 in the chemotherapy arm (estimated difference: −10.39 [95% CI: −14.55, −6.23]; p-value 
<0.001).   
The adjusted mean change from baseline during the overall time period from randomisation until 
6 months for appetite loss showed an improvement of −5.51 in the osimertinib arm vs. a 
deterioration of 2.73 in the chemotherapy arm (estimated difference: −8.24 [95% CI: −12.88, 
−3.60]; p-value <0.001). 
Time to PRO symptom deterioration 
Analysis of time to symptom deterioration was performed on symptoms from the EORTC QLQ-LC13 
questionnaire only and was calculated based on patients who had individual baseline scores ≤90 to allow for 
deterioration according to cut-offs. Time to symptom deterioration was defined as the time from 
randomisation until the date of first clinically meaningful deterioration.  Osimertinib prolonged the time to 
symptom deterioration (see Table 11.2.6.5 of the AURA3 CSR in Module 5.3.5.1).  The HR for time to PRO 
symptom deterioration for the 2 primary EORTC QLQ-LC13 symptoms of dyspnoea and cough were 0.42 
(95% CI: 0.31, 0.58; p-value <0.001) and 0.75 (95% CI: 0.53, 1.05; p-value=0.093), respectively (HR<1 
favoured osimertinib).  The HR for all other EORTC QLQ-LC13 PRO symptoms were also in favour of 
osimertinib.   
Symptom improvement rate 
Symptom improvement rate was calculated based on patients who had individual baseline scores ≥10 to 
leave room for improvements according to cut-offs.  Symptom improvement was defined as a clinically 
Assessment report

meaningful improvement (a decrease from baseline score ≥10 for LC13 and C30) in that item/scale at 
2 consecutive visits. 
The ORs for symptom improvement rate for the 5 primary PRO symptoms was 1.96 (95% CI: 1.20, 3.22; 
p-value=0.008) for fatigue; 2.50 (95% CI: 1.31, 4.84, p-value=0.006) for appetite loss; 2.71 (95% CI: 
1.60, 4.68, p-value <0.001) for dyspnoea; 1.51 (95% CI: 0.87, 2.61, p-value=0.144) for cough; and 1.66 
(95% CI: 0.83, 3.34, p-value=0.149) for chest pain (an OR>1 favouring osimertinib) (see Table 11.2.6.6 of 
the AURA3 CSR in Module 5.3.5.1). 
Analyses of the pre-defined symptoms of interest, global health status and physical functioning domains of 
the EORTC-C30 scales, showed OR in favour of osimertinib (OR physical functioning 2.40, p-value=0.005; 
OR global health status 1.84, p-value=0.025). 
The OR for symptom improvement rate for all other PRO symptoms from EORTC QLQ-LC13 and EORTC 
QLQ-C30 were also in favour of osimertinib, with the exception of diarrhoea and pain medication.

Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analyses 
Clinically meaningful and statistically superior improvement in PFS for patients on osimertinib compared to 
those on chemotherapy was seen consistently across subgroups of interest, which included ethnicity (Asian 
vs. Non-Asian), age at screening (<65 years vs. ≥65 years), gender (male vs. female), smoking history (yes 
vs. no), CNS metastases status at entry (yes vs. no), mutation status at baseline (exon 19 deletion vs. 
L858R mutation), and duration of prior treatment with EGFR-TKI (<6 months vs. ≥6 months).  
All calculated HRs for PFS in subgroups were below 0.50, indicating a minimum of a 50% reduction in the risk 
of progression or death for the assessed subgroups.  Improvements in PFS for patients on osimertinib 
compared to those on chemotherapy were observed both in patients with and without CNS metastases at 
study entry, with HRs of 0.32 (95% CI: 0.21, 0.49) and 0.40 (95% CI: 0.29, 0.55), respectively. 
Numerically greater improvements in PFS with respect to chemotherapy were observed in Asian compared 
to Non-Asian patients (HR=0.32 vs. 0.48, respectively), in female compared to male patients (HR=0.34 vs. 
0.43, respectively) and in patients with tumours that harboured an exon 19 deletion compared to an L858R 
mutation (HR=0.34 vs. 0.46, respectively). 
A global interaction test did not provide evidence of any treatment-by-covariate interaction for the 
covariates of ethnicity, gender, age, mutation status, duration of prior EGFR-TKI, CNS metastases, smoking 
history (2-sided p-value=0.231). 
A post-hoc analysis of PFS was performed based on the subgroups of type of chemotherapy regimen used.  
The superiority of osimertinib over chemotherapy was independent of chemotherapy regimen, with a HR for 
osimertinib vs. pemetrexed/carboplatin of 0.24 (95% CI: 0.17, 0.35; 2-sided p-value <0.001); median PFS 
was 10.1 months (95% CI: 8.3, 12.3) vs. 4.3 months (95% CI: 4.2, 5.6) and a HR for osimertinib vs. 
pemetrexed/cisplatin of 0.33 (95% CI: 0.20, 0.54; 2-sided p-value <0.001); median PFS was 10.1 months 
(95% CI: 8.3, 12.3) vs. 5.0 months (95% CI: 4.1, 7.0) (see Figure 13 and Tables IMT0323A1, IMT0323A2, 
IMT0323B1 and IMT0323B2 of the AURA3 CSR in Module 5.3.5.1).

Subgroup based on baseline ctDNA samples 
In the subgroup of 371 patients with a baseline plasma (ctDNA) T790M status, the HR for patients with 
positive plasma T790M status (n = 172) was 0.42 (95% CI: 0.29, 0.61) and the median PFS was 8.2 months 
(95% CI: 6.8, 9.7) in the osimertinib arm compared to 4.2 months (95% CI: 4.1, 5.1) in the chemotherapy 
arm. The HR for patients with negative plasma T790M status (n = 168) was 0.34 (95% CI: 0.22, 0.52) and 
the median PFS was 12.5 months (95% CI: 10.1, NC) in the osimertinib arm compared to 5.6 months. (95% 
CI: 4.1, 6.8) in the chemotherapy arm. 
Please note that plasma samples were not tested in China patients due to sample export limitations, thus 48 
China patients were excluded from this analysis. 
Efficacy of osimertinib in patients with central nervous system metastases (AURA3) 
Overall, 134/279 (48.0%) patients in the osimertinib arm and 71/140 (50.7%) patients in the chemotherapy 
arm had a baseline brain scan performed as part of the RECIST overall assessment and subsequently sent 
for CNS BICR assessment. 
In the osimertinib arm: 
• 
• 
cFAS population includes patients with measurable and non-measurable CNSlesions (n=75). 
cEFR population includes the patients with measurable CNS lesions only (n=30). 
In the chemotherapy arm: 
• 
• 
cFAS population includes patients with measurable and non-measurable CNSlesions (n=41) 
cEFR population includes the patients with measurable CNS lesions only (n=16) 
Both the cFAS and cEFR populations were used for the CNS BICR analysis. 
Central nervous system BICR analysis in AURA3 
Central nervous system BICR analysis in AURA3 A BICR assessment of CNS efficacy based on RECIST v1.1 
in the subgroup of 116/419 (27.7%) patients identified to have CNS metastases on a baseline brain scan 
was performed in order to characterise the CNS efficacy of osimertinib. Evaluation of radiological-assessed 
CNS metastases showed a clinically meaningful improvement for patients randomised to receive osimertinib 
vs. chemotherapy. The improvement in CNS efficacy outcomes were consistent across multiple analyses. 
• 
For patients with measurable CNS metastases at baseline (CNS evaluable for response [cEFR]), a 
clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in CNS ORR was reported for patients 
in the osimertinib arm (70% [21/30 patients; 95% CI: 50.60, 85.27]) compared to those on 
chemotherapy (31.3% [5/16 patients; 95% CI: 11.02, 58.66]), with patients approximately 5 times

more likely to respond in CNS metastases to osimertinib compared to chemotherapy (OR: 5.13 
[95% CI: 1.44, 20.64; p-value=0.015]). 
 For patients with measurable and non-measurable CNS metastases at baseline (CNS full analysis 
set [cFAS]), a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in CNS ORR was 
reported for patients in the osimertinib arm (30/75 patients; 40.0% [95% CI: 28.85, 51.96]) 
compared to those on chemotherapy (7/41 patients; 17.1% [95% CI: 7.15, 32.06]), with patients 
approximately 3 times more likely to respond in CNS metastases to osimertinib compared to 
chemotherapy (OR: 3.24 [95% CI: 1.33, 8.81]; p-value=0.014).

In the cFAS, prior brain radiation was reported for 37.3% of patients in the osimertinib arm, including 18.7% 
of patients who completed radiation treatment within 6 months before starting treatment. In the 
chemotherapy arm, prior brain radiation was reported in 46.3% of patients, including 22.0% who completed 
radiation treatment within 6 months before starting treatment. Central nervous system responses were 
observed irrespective of prior brain radiotherapy. The CNN ORR for patients who received prior brain 
radiotherapy within 6 months of randomisation was 64.3% for osimertinib and 22.2% for chemotherapy. 
The CNS ORR for patients who received no prior brain radiotherapy or brain radiotherapy >6 months prior to 
the start of study treatment was 34.4% for osimertinib and 15.6% for chemotherapy. 
Efficacy analyses by CNS metastases status at baseline in AURA3 
An efficacy analysis based on investigator assessment of the FAS (n = 419) using RECIST v1.1 was 
performed based on CNS metastases status (yes or no) at study entry. The CNS metastases status was 
identified by CNS lesion site at baseline, medical history, and/or prior surgery, and/or prior radiotherapy to 
CNS metastases. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/134310/2017 
Page 50/113 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Irrespective of CNS metastases status at study entry, a statistically significant and clinically meaningful 
improvement in PFS based on investigator assessment using RECIST v1.1 was observed in the patients on 
osimertinib compared to patients on chemotherapy. There was a clear separation of the KM curves in favour 
of osimertinib for the duration of the study, irrespective of the history of CNS metastases status at study 
entry. 
Analysis of appearance of new CNS lesions in AURA3 
In AURA3, based on investigator assessment using RECIST v1.1, osimertinib decreased the appearance of 
new CNS metastases as compared with chemotherapy (4.7% vs. 14.3%, respectively). Based on BICR 
assessment, new CNS metastases were seen in 2.5% of patients on osimertinib vs. 9.3% of patients on 
chemotherapy. Osimertinib reduced the proportion of patients developing new CNS lesions compared with 
the chemotherapy arm, irrespective of CNS metastases status at baseline. 
SUPPORTIVE SINGLE-ARM PHASE II STUDIES: AURA extension and AURA2 
In order to provide a mature data perspective on efficacy in a broader patient population, including both 
second-line therapy and ≥third-line therapy, and to show the consistency of efficacy findings in AURA3 with 
the known efficacy profile of osimertinib, pooled efficacy findings of Phase II AURA extension and AURA2 
studies at DCO3 (1 November 2015) are provided in this application.   
These more mature DCO3 data (Yang et al 2016) support the durability of efficacy findings in this broad 
patient population, allow longer-term characterisation of the safety profile and confirm the consistency of 
the Phase II data with the osimertinib arm of AURA3.  The patient population enrolled in these Phase II 
studies was similar to that in AURA3, consisting of pre-treated patients with locally advanced or metastatic 
NSCLC whose tumours were EGFR mutation-positive and T790M mutation-positive, as confirmed by central 
testing, and who had progressed on or after receiving at least 1 prior regimen of EGFR-TKI therapy.  The 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/134310/2017 
Page 51/113 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
primary difference to the AURA3 population was the inclusion of patients receiving ≥third-line therapy; 
approximately one-third (31.4%) of patients were receiving osimertinib as second-line therapy and 
two-thirds (68.6%) as ≥third-line.   
Key study design features, including inclusion and exclusion criteria and follow-up criteria were similar 
between AURA3 and the Phase II studies.  At DCO3, most patients in the Phase II studies had approximately 
12 months of follow-up; the total treatment exposure of patients enrolled in AURA extension and AURA2 
ranged from 0 months to 17.6 months 13 months).

study to assess the safety, tolerability, 
pharmacokinetics and anti-tumour 
activity of ascending doses of 
AZD9291 (Osimertinib) in patients 
with advanced NSCLC who have 
progressed following prior therapy 
with an EGFR-TKI agent (AURA) 
Primary:  
The primary objective of the AURA 
study was to investigate the safety, 
tolerability, and efficacy (ORR) of 
osimertinib when given orally to 
patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic NSCLC who had 
progressed following prior therapy 
with an EGFR-TKI agent. 
Secondary, extension component: 
•  To characterise the 
pharmacokinetics of osimertinib 
and its metabolites (AZ5104 and 
AZ7550) after multiple oral 
doses; 
•  To obtain additional assessments 
of the anti-tumour activity of

•  To investigate the effect of 
osimertinib on QT interval 
corrected for heart rate (QTc) 
after oral dosing to NSCLC 
patients; 
•  To assess the impact of 
osimertinib on patients’ 
disease-related symptoms and 
HRQoL; 
•  To characterise the 
pharmacokinetics of osimertinib 
and its metabolites (AZ5104 and

Efficacy results from pooled Phase II studies 
Efficacy findings in the pooled Phase II studies at DCO3 (1 November 2015) were consistent with those 
reported in the original MAA.  These more mature data confirm the durability of osimertinib effects in a 
broader population (compared to AURA3) of pre-treated patients (including second-line and ≥third-line) with 
advanced EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC with longer follow-up.   
The consistency of osimertinib effects was further supported by the similarity of findings in the osimertinib 
arm of the Phase III AURA3 study with those reported in the pooled Phase II studies, AURA extension and 
AURA2.

4.3.3.  Discussion 
AURA3 is a Phase III, open-label, randomised study (2:1 ratio [osimertinib:platinum-based chemotherapy]) 
specifically designed to compare the efficacy of osimertinib vs. platinum- based doublet chemotherapy 
(pemetrexed plus carboplatin or pemetrexed plus cisplatin, followed by optional pemetrexed maintenance) 
as second-line treatment in patients with confirmed advanced EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC who 
had progressed following 1 line of treatment with an approved EGFR-TKI. 
Patient population 
Patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC (histologically or cytologically confirmed), with a 
documented EGFR mutation known to be associated with EGFR-TKI sensitivity, were recruited. All patients 
were to have centrally confirmed T790M mutant-positive status from a tissue biopsy sample taken after 
documented disease progression on first-line treatment with an approved EGFR-TKI. Of note, there was no 
requirement that radiological progression had to occur while receiving continuous treatment with an 
EGFR-TKI or that randomisation had to occur within 4 weeks of radiological progression. 
Patients who had received more than one prior line of therapy for advanced NSCLC were excluded, as were 
those with any contraindication for pemetrexed and cisplatin/carboplatin (e.g. predominantly squamous cell 
histology). All patients were to have adequate cardiac, hepatic and renal function, World Health Organization 
(WHO) performance status of 0 or 1 with no deterioration over the previous 2 weeks and a minimum life 
expectancy of 12 weeks. Patients with CNS metastases were eligible if they were asymptomatic, stable and 
not requiring steroids for at least 4 weeks prior to start of study treatment. On comparing these 
inclusion/exclusion criteria with those from the phase II studies, they seem to be pretty similar, with the 
main difference in the number of prior treatment lines received. In AURA 3 all patients were to receive study 
treatments as second line therapy, whereas in AURA and AURA2 only about 24% received osimertinib in 
second line and the majority (69%) in ≥third line.  
Treatments 
In the osimertinib arm, patients could continue on treatment as long as they were deriving clinical benefit, 
as judged by the investigator, or until a treatment discontinuation criterion was met. In the chemotherapy 
arm, patients could receive up to 6 cycles of pemetrexed plus cisplatin or carboplatin as initial treatment. 
Those patients whose disease had not progressed after 4 cycles of platinum-based doublet chemotherapy 
could continue on maintenance monotherapy with pemetrexed according to the approved label use or local 
practice guidelines. The use of carboplatin or cisplatin based therapy in the clinical practice is based on the 
expected tolerability and preferences by oncologist. According to the current clinical guidelines cisplatin 
could have a slightly superior efficacy to carboplatin in meta-analysis, even though it may not be worth the 
added toxicity in the palliative care setting.  
Once patients in the chemotherapy arm were determined to have objective radiological progression by the 
investigator, with confirmation by blinded independent central review (BICR), they were given the 
opportunity to begin treatment with osimertinib 80 mg once daily. This crossover even affecting the OS data 
is considered ethical. 
Endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint of AURA3 was PFS in the FAS, based on investigator assessment according to 
RECIST v1.1, which is agreed. However, considering the poor prognosis of this setting (survival of 1 to 2 
years), the submission of data in terms of OS appears mandatory even if considering the potential 
confounding effect of the cross-over of patients as well as the effect of next-line therapies. OS data at the 
time of submission of responses are awaited. 
Main secondary endpoints were DoR, DCR, OS and QoL. Apparently data on PFS 2 has been collected as an 
 
 
 
 
 
exploratory endpoint; this is considered of great value, especially in the subgroup of patients crossing-over 
from the chemotherapy arm to the osimertinib one. Data on PFS2 should be submitted. 
Randomisation and SAP 
Suitable patients were centrally randomised to receive either osimertinib 80 mg or platinum-based doublet 
chemotherapy in a 2:1 ratio. Patients were stratified at randomisation based on ethnicity (Asian/Non-Asian). 
According to the statistical analysis plan, three analyses of OS will be conducted. The DCO for the first OS 
analysis was approximately 4 months after the PFS DCO of 15 April 2016. A second analysis of OS will be 
performed when the OS data are approximately 50% mature (approximately 205 deaths events). A third 
analysis of OS will be performed when the OS data are approximately 70% mature (approximately 287 
deaths events). It is highly questionable the number of interim analyses planned.  
Results 
A total of 1036 patients were enrolled in the study (ie, signed informed consent and were screened) but a 
total of 617 patients failed screening. This was mainly due to the lack of central confirmation of T790M 
(81%). 
Despite patients were randomised to treatment at 126 study centres in 18 countries, no individual country 
randomised more than 20% of patients. 
Amendments to protocol (two substantial amendments were carried out) were mainly related to statistical 
issues and appear to be driven by the updated knowledge subsequent to results of AURA and AURA2 trial.  
The number of protocol deviations is overall high (25.3%), however most of them were finally solved (e.g. 
from the 6 patients with no centrally confirmed T790M mutation-positive status, only 3 were tumour T790M 
negative and in one of them ctDNA plasma sample was positive).  
The most frequent protocol deviation related to inclusion/exclusion criteria was the number of treatment 
lines previously received, taking into account that the trials that gave rise to the conditional approval of 
osimertinib (AURA2 and AURA extension) demonstrated the efficacy of osimertinib in a more pre-treated 
population (second line and ≥ thrid line therapy) than the population studied in AURA3 and taking into 
account that percentages of this protocol deviation are low and more or less balanced  between trial arms 
(3.6% in the osimertinib arm and 4.3% in the chemotherapy arm; only 1 patient (in the osimertinib arm) 
received 3 prior lines of therapy) this deviation is not considered susceptible from impacting study result 
•  Baseline characteristics 
Patient demographic seem to be well-balanced between arms. The median age was 62 years (range 20 to 90 
years), with 64 patients (15.3%) aged ≥75 years. There was a greater proportion of female patients 
(64.2%) and the population was predominantly Asian (65.4%) and white (32%). Two-thirds of patients had 
never smoked (67.5%) and a low percentage of patients (5.3%) were current smokers.  
Regarding disease characteristics, most patients had a WHO performance status of 1. The main histological 
type was adenocarcinoma (98.6%). The most common EGFR sensitising mutations were exon 19 deletion, 
being higher in the osimertinib arm (68.5% vs.62.1%) and exon 21 L858R (29.7% osimertinib vs. 32.1% 
chemotherapy). All patients but 3 were centrally confirmed as T790M mutation-positive.  
The vast majority of patients had metastatic disease, however some imbalances are noted in the proportion 
of patients with liver metastases, (20.1% in the osimertinib arm vs. 29.3% in the chemotherapy arm) and 
in the proportion of patients with bone/locomotor metastases (37.6% in the osimertinib arm vs. 50.7% in 
the chemotherapy arm).  
334.4% of patients presented brain metastases, however these were required to be asymptomatic, stable 
and not requiring steroids for at least 4 weeks prior to the start of study treatment.

Overall the main demographic and disease characteristics are comparable to that of populations recruited in 
AURA2 and AURA extension trials (pooled Phase II trials). Prior therapies is the most important difference 
between AURA3 and the previous trials. In AURA3 all patients but 16 had previously received only 1 
EGFR-TKI agent. 3.6% in the osimertinib and 4.3% in the chemotherapy arm had received 2 prior lines. Only 
one patient in the osimertinib arm had received ≥3 lines. Two thirds of patients had received gefitinib and 
one thirderlotinib, the great majority received EGFR-TKI therapy for more than 6 months. The median time 
from progression on EGFR-TKI to randomisation was 55 days. 
In the chemotherapy arm investigators chose to administer a combination of pemetrexed plus carboplatin 
for 94 (69.1%) patients, with 42 (30.9%) patients receiving a combination of pemetrexed plus cisplatin. No 
patient switched from cisplatin to carboplatin during randomised treatment on the study. 73 (53.7%) 
patients went on to receive pemetrexed maintenance monotherapy. 
•  Outcomes 
A statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in terms of the primary endpoint, PFS (HR: 
0.30 [95% CI: 0.23, 0.41]; p-value: <0.001), was shown by osimertinib compared to the control arm.  
Treatment with osimertinib resulted in a 5.7-month improvement in median PFS compared to chemotherapy 
(10.1 months [95% CI: 8.3, 12.3] vs. 4.4 months [95% CI: 4.2, 5.6]).  
The sensitivity analysis of PFS by BICR on the FAS was consistent with the investigator-based analysis, 
showing 6.8-months of improvement in median PFS in the osimertinib arm (11 months) compared to the 
chemotherapy arm (4.2 months) (HR: 0.28 [95% CI: 0.20, 0.38]). 
The percentage of patients without progression at the time of DCO was approximately 50% and 21% in 
osimertinib and chemotherapy arms respectively. 
Results in terms of PFS seem robust enough. In this sense, all the sensitive analyses carried out did not 
reveal significant differences regarding the main analysis. 
PFS results in the subgroups analyses were consistent with the whole population of the study. Due to the 
limited number of patients, there are no data in terms of HR in those patients with duration of the prior 
EGFR-TKI < 6 months, however, the median PFS in the osimertinib arm was 12.4 months (95% CI: 6.8, NC) 
compared to 4.2 months (95% CI: 1.7, 6.7). 
On contextualising PFS results for chemotherapy in the AURA3 study, the median PFS with first-line platinum 
doublet in EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC ranges from 4.6 months to 6.9 months, and the ORR from 15% to 
47%. Bearing in mind that the patients in AURA3 study had been previously treated with EGFR-TKI therapy, 
the indirect comparison could be biased. However when results in the chemotherapy arm from the IMPRESS 
trial are considered, ORR and to some extent PFS, show similar results to those obtained in the AURA3 study. 
At the DCO for the primary analysis of PFS, no OS analysis was performed, a high cross-over rate has 
already been reported which will put interpretability of results at risk. Data are awaited at the time of 
submission of responses. Data on PFS2, an exploratory endpoint, will help in the interpretation of results, 
especially in the subgroup of patients crossing over to osimertinib arm. The applicant should clarify whether 
data on PFS2 will be available. 
Results in terms of secondary endpoints consistently support primary findings. An ORR by investigator of 
70.6% (95% CI: 64.9, 75.9) was observed in the osimertinib arm and of 31.4% (95% CI: 23.9, 39.8) in the 
chemotherapy arm (investigator assessment) [OR of 5.39 (95% CI: 3.47, 8.48) (p-value: <0.001)]. Results 
by BICR were consistent, which add robustness to the results seeing as no confirmation of response was 
required. The median DoR based on investigator assessment at 51.9% maturity was 9.7 months (95% CI: 
8.3, 11.6) in the osimertinib arm vs. 4.1 months (95% CI: 3.0, 5.6) in the chemotherapy arm. ORR results 
are consistent with primary endpoint data from the phase II trials (updated data at data cut-off of 1/Nov/15) 
Assessment report

that gave rise to the conditional approval of osimertinib ORR of pooled phase II trials 66.0% (95% CI: 61.1, 
70.7). The historical ORR obtained by chemotherapy, or TKI re-challenge, are considerably lower than those 
seen in all the AURA studies.  
The disease control rate based on investigator assessment was 93.2% (95% CI: 89.6, 95.9) in the 
osimertinib arm vs. 74.3% (95% CI: 66.2, 81.3) in the chemotherapy arm and there was a greater mean 
percentage tumour shrinkage from baseline in patients on osimertinib compared to patients on 
chemotherapy. 
PRO endpoints showed an overall improvement of symptoms associated to the disease, however due to the 
open label design, no firm conclusions can be drawn from QoL 
It should be noted the antitumor activity of osimertinib in patients with measurable CNS metastases at 
baseline (asymptomatic, stable and not requiring steroids for at least 4 weeks prior to the start of study 
treatment) 70% [21/30 patients; 95% CI: 50.60, 85.27]) compared to those on chemotherapy (31.3% 
[5/16 patients; 95% CI: 11.02, 58.66]. 
No data in those patients who received osimertinib after progression of chemotherapy (60%) have been 
offered. 
Finally, results from the AURA3 study confirm the previous data obtained from the AURA extension and 
AURA2. 
In conclusion, osimertinib seems to offer a clinically meaningful result for those patients with T790M 
positive. Nevertheless, OS data and PFS2 results should be submitted before conclusion of this variation. 
4.4.  Clinical Safety aspects 
4.4.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
The safety evaluation to inform the benefit-risk assessment for this application focuses on the comparative 
safety profile of osimertinib 80 mg vs. chemotherapy in 415 patients in AURA3 as of the DCO1 for 
progression-free survival (PFS) of 15 April 2016. More mature (ie, longer duration of exposure) safety data 
from the 411 patients in the pooled Phase II studies of osimertinib at DCO3 (1 November 2015) are used to 
support the absence of unexpected additional toxicity burden with longer exposure to osimertinib and its use 
in second- and ≥third-line therapy. 
AURA3 safety data are based on the DCO date for the primary efficacy analysis of PFS: 15 April 2016. 
For the pooled Phase II studies, the DCO used is the third DCO: 1 November 2015. 
For the AURA Phase I component, as part of the pooled safety analysis for cardiac effects and ILD, the DCO 
used is the second DCO: 1 May 2015.

•  Extent of exposure 
AURA 3 
All patients randomised to osimertinib received at least 1 dose of study medication. Of the 140 patients 
randomised to the chemotherapy arm, 136 were dosed. Median exposure was 8.1 months (range: 0.2-18.5) 
in the osimertinib arm. Actual exposure was similar to intended exposure in the osimertinib arm (median 7.9 
months). A maximum of 6 cycles for the platinum-based doublet chemotherapy was allowed in the 
chemotherapy arm; the median duration was 4.2 cycles (range: 0.4-14.5). Of the 136 patients in the 
chemotherapy arm, 42 (30.9%) received pemetrexed plus cisplatin and 94 (69.1%) received pemetrexed 
plus carboplatin based on Investigator choice

Table: Duration of exposure in AURA3 (Safety analysis set)
Extent of exposure in the pooled Phase II studies 
Since osimertinib is dosed continuously without a maximum duration, longer study follow-up may result in 
longer duration of exposure. Hence, due to the longer follow-up time, patients in the 2 Phase II studies had 
longer duration of exposure than those in AURA3 (median of 13.0 months and 8.1 months, respectively) and 
provide additional safety information for the potential use of osimertinib in the longer term. 
At the time of the 1 November 2015 DCO for these studies, 228 (55.5%) patients remained on osimertinib 
treatment (106/201 patients [52.7%] in AURA extension, and 122/210 patients [58.1%] in AURA2). The 
median duration of exposure for the 411 patients was 13.0 months (range: 0.0-17.6 months), with the 
majority of patients (188 [45.7%]) receiving 12-15 months of treatment. Actual exposure was similar to 
intended exposure (median: 12.9 months; range: 0.0-17.6 months), indicating that the frequency and 
median duration of interruptions had low impact on exposure. Overall mean and median relative dose 
intensity (RDI) was 98.5% and 100.0%, respectively. 
•  Dose modifications 
AURA 3 
A total of 76 (27.2%) patients in the osimertinib arm had interruptions vs the following delays in 
administration of chemotherapy: 57 (41.9%) pemetrexed, 16 (38.1%) cisplatin, 28 (29.8%) carboplatin. 
The proportion of patients with dose modifications (overall and those requiring modifications due to AEs), 
dose interruption/delay (overall and those requiring interruption/delay due to AEs), and dose reductions 
(overall and those requiring reduction due to AEs) were also less frequent in the osimertinib arm than in the 
chemotherapy arm.

Dose modifications in the pooled Phase II studies 
At the time of the 1 November 2015 DCO for the Phase II studies, 152/411 (37%) of patients had a dose 
interruption, the majority (84 [20.4%]) due to AEs; 19 (4.6%) of patients had a dose reduction, all due to 
AEs 
•  Adverse events 
Common adverse events in AURA 3 
Adverse events were most frequently reported (≥50% of patients) in the SOCs of Gastrointestinal (189 
[67.7%] patients), Skin & Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders (159 [57.0%] and Infections and Infestations 
(142 [50.9%] in the osimertinib arm and Gastrointestinal Disorders (106 [77.9% patients]) and General 
Disorders & Administration Site Conditions (88 [64.7%]) in the chemotherapy arm. The incidence of AEs was 
at least 10 percentage points higher in the osimertinib arm than in the chemotherapy arm for diarrhoea 
(40.5% osimertinib vs 11.0% chemotherapy), dry skin (18.6% vs 4.4%), paronychia (16.5% vs 1.5%), and 
dermatitis acneiform (12.9% vs 2.2%). The incidence of AEs was at least 10 percentage points lower in the 
osimertinib arm than in the chemotherapy arm for nausea (16.1% osimertinib vs 49.3% chemotherapy), 
decreased appetite (17.9% vs 36.0%), constipation (14.0% vs 34.6%), fatigue (15.8% vs 27.9%), anaemia 
(6.8% vs 27.9%), and platelet count decreased (4.3% vs 15.4%).

Table Most common adverse events (frequency of ≥10% in either treatment group) in AURA3 (Safety 
analysis set) 
Common adverse events in Phase II studies 
The nature and severity of AEs in the pooled Phase II studies are consistent with those in the osimertinib arm 
in AURA3, with similar incidences and severity of the overall grouped term. The exceptions to this were a 
higher incidence of the individual PT of rash reported in the pooled Phase II studies (24.6%) compared to the 
2.5% incidence in the osimertinib arm in AURA3, and the higher incidence of dermatitis acneiform in the 
osimertinib arm of AURA3 (12.9%) compared to the pooled phase II studies (8.3%). These exceptions may 
reflect differences in reporting patterns from a generic “rash” PT used in Phase II studies to the more specific 
PT of dermatitis acneiform in AURA3. In all studies, fewer than half of patients were treated for events in the 
Skin Effects grouped term, and <1% of Skin Effects AEs led to dose reduction or dose discontinuation. 
Among the 411 patients in the Phase II studies, 406 (98.8%) reported AEs. The most commonly reported 
SOCs were GI disorders (303 [73.7%]), Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders (283 [68.9%]), and 
Infections and Infestations (243 [59.1%]). 
Assessment report

The most commonly reported PTs were diarrhoea (187 [45.5%] patients), dry skin (105 [25.5%]), rash 
(101 [24.6%]), paronychia (89 [21.7%]), decreased appetite (84 [20.4%]), and nausea (82 [20.0%]). 
Adverse events of CTCAE grade 3 or higher in AURA3 
In the osimertinib arm, CTCAE ≥grade 3 AEs were reported in a wide range of PTs, covering multiple SOCs. 
Pulmonary embolism was reported in 4 (1.4%) patients and neutrophil count decreased, asthenia, 
decreased appetite, diarrhoea, fatigue, ALT increased, AST increased, and dyspnoea were reported in 3 
(1.1%) patients each. Adverse events CTCAE ≥grade 3 considered by the Investigator to be possibly related 
to the study drug were reported at a lower frequency in the osimertinib arm than in the chemotherapy arm 
(16 [5.7%] vs 46 [33.8%]).

Adverse events of CTCAE grade 3 or higher in Phase II studies 
CTCAE ≥grade 3 AEs were reported in a higher proportion of patients in the pooled Phase II studies (36.3%) 
than in the osimertinib arm of AURA3 (22.6%). 
Among the 411 patients in the Phase II studies, 149 (36.3%) had at least 1 AE of CTCAE≥grade 3. Events 
were reported in a wide range of PTs, covering multiple SOCs, mostly with 1 or 2 events per PT. 
The following AEs of CTCAE ≥grade 3 were reported in ≥1% of patients: pneumonia (11 [2.7%]), anaemia 
and pulmonary embolism (10 [2.4%] patients each), dyspnoea and neutrophil count decreased (9 [2.2%] 
patients each), ALT increased (8 [1.9%]), neutropenia (7 [1.7%]), white blood cell (WBC) count decreased 
(6 [1.5%]), asthenia, QT prolonged, and hyponatraemia (5 [1.2%]) patients each, and diarrhoea, ILD, 
nausea, pneumonitis, and thrombocytopenia (4 [1.0%] patients each. 
•  Analysis of adverse events by organ system or syndrome: adverse events of special 
interest 
Interstitial lung disease in AURA3 
At the DCO, ILD (grouped term) was reported in 10 (3.6%) patients in the osimertinib arm vs 1 (0.7%) 
patient in the chemotherapy arm.  
Among the 10 patients with ILD or ILD-like events in the osimertinib arm, 4 (40%) patients were Caucasian, 
3 (30%) were Japanese, and 3 (30%) were Asian non-Japanese. The incidence per ethnicity was 4/89 
(4.5%) in Caucasian patients, 3/41 (7.3%) in Japanese patients, and 3/141 (2.1%) in Asian-non-Japanese 
patients. 
ILD was reported as an SAE in 3 (1.1%) patients in the osimertinib arm and 1 (0.7%) patient in the 
chemotherapy arm. 
Among the 10 (3.6%) patients in the osimertinib arm who had ILD or ILD-like events, 9 had ILD events that 
were a maximum of CTCAE grade 1 (3/10 [30%]) or grade 2 (6/10 [60%])  and there were no CTCAE grade 
3 or grade 4 events. One osimertinib patient had a CTCAE grade 5 (fatal) ILD. In the chemotherapy arm, the 
1 event of ILD was CTCAE grade 3. 
The median time to onset for ILD grouped-term events was 105.5 days (range: 8-253) in the osimertinib 
arm and 68.0 days in the 1 patient in the chemotherapy arm. 
In the osimertinib arm, the ILD outcome was reported as recovered for 4 (1.4%) patients, as recovering for 
1 (0.4%) patient, as not recovered for 4 (1.4%) patients, and as fatal for 1 (0.4%) patient. For the 1 patient 
in the chemotherapy arm, the outcome of ILD was reported as recovered. 
Interstitial lung disease with a fatal outcome was reported in 1 (0.4%) patient in the osimertinib arm and no 
patient in the chemotherapy arm. 
Interstitial lung disease in pooled Phase II studies 
The incidence of ILD (grouped term) events was similar between the pooled Phase II studies and the 
osimertinib arm of AURA3 (2.9% and 3.6%, respectively). At the DCO of 1 November 2015, ILD (grouped 
term) was reported in 12/411 (2.9%) patients. ILD was reported as an SAE in 9/12 (75.0%) patients. 
Maximum CTCAE grade for AEs of ILD was reported as grade 1 for 4/12 (33.3%) patients, grade 3 for 4/12 
(33.3%) patients, and grade 5 for 4/12 (33.3%) patients. The median time to onset for ILD grouped-term 
events was 84.0 days (range: 17-468). Outcome for AEs of ILD was reported as recovered for 5/12 (41.7%)

patients, as recovering for 1/12 (8.3%), as not recovered for 2/12 (16.7%), and as fatal for 4/12 (33.3%) 
patients. 
Cardiac effects in AURA3 
Adverse events in the overall Cardiac Effects (QT) grouped term were reported in 12 (4.3%) patients in the 
osimertinib arm vs 6 (4.4%) patients in the chemotherapy arm.  
Table: Cardiac effects adverse events, by grouped term and MedDRA preferred term in AURA3 (Safety 
analysis set) 
Changes from baseline of >30 msec in mean QTcF were observed in 86 (30.8%) patients in the osimertinib 
arm and 7 (5.1%) patients in the chemotherapy arms. Five patients (1.8%) in the osimertinib arm had QTcF 
increases >60 msec during the study vs. none in the chemotherapy arm. No patient in either arm had >90 
msec increases in QTcF from baseline during the study. Patients were allowed to be enrolled in the study with 
a QTcF value ≤470 msec. A mean QTcF value >450 msec at any time was reported in 64 patients (22.9%) in 
the osimertinib arm and 12 patients (8.8%) in the chemotherapy arm. A QTcF value >480 msec at any time 
was reported in 5 patients (1.8%) in the osimertinib arm and 1 patient (0.7%) in the chemotherapy arm. 
The maximum median change from baseline in LVEF was similar in the 2 treatment arms: -2.0% in the 
osimertinib arm at Cycle 9 (range: −45% to +16%) and Cycle 13 (range: −24% to +16%) vs. a maximum 
median change of −1.5% in the chemotherapy arm at Cycle 9 (range: −14% to +11%). Fourteen patients 
(5.0%) in the osimertinib arm had a LVEF decrease ≥10 percentage points (pp) from baseline to a LVEF value 
of <50% compared to 0 patients in the chemotherapy arm. Fourteen patients (5.0%) in the osimertinib arm

and 1 patient (0.7%) in the chemotherapy arm had a LVEF decrease ≥15 percentage points to a LVEF value 
≥50%. Conversely, 23 patients(9.0%) in the osimertinib arm had a LVEF increase ≥10 ppfrom baseline vs. 4 
patients (4.3%) in the chemotherapy arm. Fourteen (5.0%) patients in the osimertinib arm and no patients 
in the chemotherapy arm had a LVEF decrease ≥10 pp from baseline to a LVEF value of <50%. An LVEF 
decrease ≥15 pp to a LVEF value ≥50% was reported for 14 (5.0%) patients in the osimertinib arm and 1 
(0.7%) patient in the chemotherapy arm. LVEF increase ≥10 pp from baseline was seen in 23 (9.0%) 
patients in the osimertinib arm vs. 4 patients (4.3%) in the chemotherapy arm.

Cardiac effects in Phase II studies 
The incidence of AEs in the Cardiac Effects (cardiac function) grouped term in the pooled Phase II studies 
was 1.7% (7). Five (1.2%) patients in the pooled Phase II studies had a PT of ejection fraction decreased (3 
patients with CTCAE grade 2 and 2 patients with CTCAE grade 3), 1 (0.2%) patient had a PT of CTCAE grade 
5 cardiac failure congestive, and 1 (0.2%) had a PT of CTCAE grade 2 pulmonary oedema. LVEF was 
observed in the overall population, with no deterioration of cardiac function observed. In AURA extension, in 
174 patients who had a post-baseline LVEF assessment, 3 (1.5%) had an LVEF decrease of ≥10 percentage 
points from baseline, to an LVEF value<50%, and 18 (10.3%) patients had an LVEF increase of ≥10 
percentage points from baseline. In AURA2, in 195 patients who had a post-baseline LVEF assessment, 9 
(4.3%) had an LVEF decrease of ≥10 percentage points from baseline, to an LVEF value <50% and 20 
(10.3%) had an LVEFincrease of ≥10 percentage points from baseline 
In the pooled Phase II studies, AEs with PTs in the TdP/QT prolongation SMQ category were reported in 19 
(4.6%) patients. All of these were PTs of electrocardiogram QT prolonged. The maximum CTCAE grade was 
grade 1 in the majority of patients (11 [2.7%]), with CTCAE grade 2 in 3 (0.7%) patients and CTCAE grade 
3 in 5 (1.2%) patients

Diarrhoea in AURA3 
Adverse events of diarrhoea were reported in 113 (40.5%) patients in the osimertinib arm and 15 (11%) 
patients in the chemotherapy arm; in most patients the events were CTCAE grade 1 (96/113 [85.0%] 
osimertinib; 10/15 [66.7%] chemotherapy) or CTCAE grade 2 (14/113 [12.4%] osimertinib, 3/15 [20.0%] 
chemotherapy. No SAEs or CTCAE grade 4 or grade 5 events were reported in either treatment arm. No 
events of diarrhoea led to discontinuation of treatment in either arm. 
CTCAE grade 3 events were similar between the 2 treatment groups: 3 (1.1%) patients in the osimertinib 
arm and 2 (1.5%) patients in the chemotherapy arm. 
Analysis was performed to identify patients with AEs of diarrhoea in conjunction with AEs of dehydration, 
renal failure, or electrolyte abnormality (defined as a patient having any of the following preferred terms: 
hyperkalaemia, hypokalaemia, hypernatraemia, hyponatraemia, hypermagnesaemia, hypomagnesaemia). 
No patient experienced diarrhoea concurrently with AEs of dehydration or renal failure in either treatment 
arm. Two (0.7%) patients in the osimertinib arm and no patient in the chemotherapy arm had diarrhoea 
concurrent with an electrolyte abnormality AE 
On an episode level, 197 events of diarrhoea were reported among the 113 patients with events in the 
osimertinib arm and 22 events were reported among the 15 patients with events in the chemotherapy arm. 
Events not requiring supportive medication: 141/197 (71.6%) events in the osimertinib arm, 18/22 
(81.8%) events in the chemotherapy arm. 
The median time to onset of first event of diarrhoea was 22 days (range: 1 to 491) in the osimertinib arm vs. 
8 days (range: 2 to 157 days) in the chemotherapy arm. After an initial increase during the first month of 
treatment with osimertinib, the prevalence of diarrhoea remained relatively constant over the duration of 
treatment, with approximately 15% of patients experiencing diarrhoea at any one point. 
Diarrhoea in the pooled Phase II studies 
Diarrhoea is a well-described and very common AE with osimertinib. Findings in the pooled Phase II studies 
were consistent with those in AURA3 in terms of the frequency of occurrence, nature, severity, clinical 
course and outcome of the events. 
Among the 411 patients in the Phase II studies, diarrhoea was reported in 187 (45.5%) patients during 
treatment with osimertinib 80 mg. Most events were CTCAE grade 1, in 
158/411 (38.4%) patients overall, which was 84.5% of the 187 patients with an AE of diarrhoea. CTCAE 
grade 2 events were reported in 24 (5.8%) patients, and CTCAE grade 3 in 4 (1.0%) patients. No CTCAE 
grade 4 or grade 5 AEs of diarrhoea were reported 
Skin effects in AURA3 
The AESI of Skin Effects was evaluated by review of 4 subgroups: Rashes & Acnes, Pruritus, Dry Skin, and 
Exfoliative Rash. 
Adverse events in the Skin Effects grouped term were reported more frequently in the osimertinib arm (140 
[50.2%] patients) than in the chemotherapy arm (20 [14.7%] patients), with the most common subgroup 
in both treatment groups being Rashes & Acnes. The most commonly reported PTs were dry skin (52 
[18.6%] vs 6 [4.4%]), dermatitis acneiform (36 [12.9%) osimertinib vs 3 [2.2%] chemotherapy), and 
pruritus (35 [12.5%] vs 6 [4.4%]).  
The severity of Skin Effects AEs was similar between the 2 treatment groups, with the majority of events 
being CTCAE grade 1 (mild): 120 (43.0%) patients in the osimertinib arm and 16 (11.8%) patients in the 
chemotherapy arm. CTCAE grade 2 events were reported in 18 (6.5%) and 4 (2.9%) patients, respectively.

Two (0.7%) patients in the osimertinib arm had CTCAE grade 3 events (both erythema). There were no 
CTCAE grade 4 or grade 5 events in either treatment group. No SAEs or discontinuations, dose reductions, 
or dose interruptions/delays due to Skin Effects AEs were reported. 
There were no severe bullous, severe blistering, or severe exfoliative rash events, no events suggestive of 
hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens Johnson Syndrome or toxic epidermal necrosis (Lyell’s 
syndrome), and no events of phototoxicity. 
The median time to onset of Skin Effects was 16.0 days (range: 1-295) in the osimertinib arm and 11.5 days 
(range: 3-120) in the chemotherapy arm 
Table: Skin effects adverse events in AURA3, by grouped term (safety analysis set) 
The most commonly reported PTs (for Rashes & Acnes) were dermatitis acneiform (36 [12.9%] patients in 
the osimertinib arm vs 3 [2.2%] patients in the chemotherapy arm), and rash maculo-papular (16 [5.7%] 
vs 3 [2.2%]). 
No SAEs or discontinuations, dose reductions, or dose interruptions/delays due to AEs in the subgroup of 
Rashes & Acnes AEs were reported. 
On an episode level, AEs in the Rashes and Acnes subgroup were more common in the osimertinib arm than 
in the chemotherapy arm: 130 events vs 9 events. No medication was administered for 67/130 (51.5%) AEs 
of rash in the osimertinib arm and 5/9 (55.6%) AEs of rash in the chemotherapy 
arm. None of the untreated AEs of rash resulted in dose modification. In the osimertinib arm, 46/67 (35.4%) 
of the untreated AEs of rash resolved and 21 (16.2%) were ongoing at DCO 
The median time to onset of events in the Rashes & Acnes subgroup was 16.0 days (range: 1-266) in the 
osimertinib arm vs 5.5 days (range: 3-43) in the chemotherapy. After an initial increase during the first 
month of treatment with osimertinib, the prevalence of rash remained relatively constant over the duration 
of treatment, with approximately 15-25% patients experiencing rash at any time point. 
Skin effects AESIs in the pooled Phase II studies 
Skin reactions are well-described AEs with osimertinib, with most events being mild to moderate in nature 
and easily managed. The incidence of AEs in the Skin Effects (grouped term) was higher in the pooled Phase 
II studies than in the osimertinib arm of AURA3: 265 (64.5%) vs 140 (50.2%) patients, respectively. 
Two subgroups accounted for most of this difference: AEs within the Rashes & Acnes subgroup were 
reported for 188 (45.7%) patients in the pooled Phase II studies, vs 94 (33.7%) in the osimertinib arm of 
AURA3; AEs within the Dry Skin subgroup were reported for 136 (33.1%) and 65 (23.3%), respectively. The 
Assessment report

other 2 subgroups were more similar between the pooled Phase II studies and the osimertinib arm of 
AURA3: in the majority of patients, Skin Effects AEs were CTCAE grade 1 (226 [55.0%] patients, which was 
85.3% of the 265 patients who had a Skin Effects AE). Among the 265 patients with a Skin Effects AE, 
36/365 (9.9%) patients had AEs of CTCAE grade 2, and 3/265 (1.17%) had AEs of CTCAE grade 3. The 
CTCAE grade 3 events consisted of erythema in 1/265 (0.4%) patient and rash maculo- papular in 2/265 
(0.8%) patients. Within the Skin Effects subgroups, only events of Rashes & Acnes led to dose modification 
(in 3 [0.7%] patients) or discontinuation (in 1 [0.2%] patient). 
Upper GI tract inflammatory events in AURA3 
Adverse events in the Upper GI Tract Inflammatory Events grouped term were reported at a similar 
frequency in the 2 treatment arms (70 [25.1%] patients in the osimertinib arm vs 30 [22.1%] patients in the 
chemotherapy arm). All events in the osimertinib arm were CTCAE grade 1 (58 [20.8%] osimertinib vs 18 
patients [13.2%] chemotherapy) or CTCAE grade 2 (12 [4.3%] osimertinib vs. 9 [6.6%] chemotherapy). 
There were no CTCAE ≥grade 3 events in the osimertinib arm. 
Table: Upper GI tract inflammatory events in AURA3, by grouped term (Safety analysis set) 
A greater proportion of patients with epistaxis events were reported in the osimertinib arm than the 
chemotherapy arm (15 [5.4%] vs 2 [1.5%], respectively). However, all events were reported as 
non-serious and CTCAE grade 1, and only 1 (in the osimertinib arm) received medical management 
(cutaneous sodium furosemide). 
Upper gastrointestinal tract inflammatory events in the pooled Phase II studies 
At the DCO of 1 November 2015, AEs in the grouped term of Upper GI inflammatory events were reported 
in a similar proportion of patients in the pooled Phase II studies as in the osimertinib arm of AURA3 (26.8% 
vs 25.1%). AEs reported within the 3 subgroups were also similar: Oral inflammation (18.0% vs 19.4%), 
Non-oral upper GI tract inflammatory events (12.4% vs 11.1%), and GI tract inflammation of unspecified 
location (0% vs 0.4%). 
The only PT reported in >5% of patients was stomatitis (60 [14.6%]), in the subgroup term of Oral 
inflammation, which did not lead to osimertinib discontinuation, dose interruption or dose modification 
Nail effects in AURA3 
Nail Effects were evaluated by review of the Nail Effects grouped term, which included PTs reported in AURA3 
of paronychia, nail infection, nail discolouration, nail disorder, nail dystrophy, nail ridging, and onychoclasis)  
Nail Effects (grouped term) AEs were reported by 61 (21.9%) patients in the osimertinib arm vs. 2 (1.5%) 
patients in the chemotherapy arm (Table 31). Paronychia was the most commonly reported nail effect PT, 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/134310/2017 
Page 77/113 
 
 
 
 
 
reported in 46 (16.5%) patients in the osimertinib arm vs. 2 (1.5%) patients in the chemotherapy arm. No 
other nail effects were observed in the chemotherapy arm. 
All Nail Effects AEs were CTCAE grade 1 (47 [16.8%] osimertinib, 1 [0.7%] chemotherapy) or CTCAE grade 
2 (14 [5.0%] osimertinib, 1 [0.7%] chemotherapy). There were no CTCAE ≥grade 3 Nail Effects AEs or SAEs 
in either treatment arm. 
Nail effects in the pooled Phase II studies 
Adverse events in the grouped term of Nail effects were reported in a higher proportion of patients in the 
pooled Phase II studies than in the osimertinib arm of AURA3: 123 (29.9%) vs 61 (21.9%) patients, 
respectively. 
Infections in AURA3 
Evaluation of the safety topic of infection was performed at a SOC level. Additional analysis was provided by 
Infection (grouped term) which consisted of the PTs of Pneumonia and Sepsis. There were no reports of 
sepsis during the treatment period or the 28-day follow-up period. 
Within the Infections and Infestations SOC, AEs were reported in 142 (50.9%) patients in the osimertinib 
arm and 49 (36.0%) patients in the chemotherapy arm. The difference between the treatment arms in this 
SOC is due largely to the higher incidence of paronychia in the osimertinib arm. 
Adverse events within this SOC were mostly grade 1 (78 [28.0%] osimertinib, 16 [11.8%) chemotherapy) 
or CTCAE grade 2 (54 [19.4%] osimertinib, 26 [19.1%] chemotherapy). Nine (3.2%) patients and 7 (5.1%) 
patients in the respective treatment arm had CTCAE grade 3 AEs. One patient (E2604303) in the osimertinib 
arm had CTCAE grade 4 SAE bronchiolitis. 
There was a low incidence of pneumonia in each of the 2 treatment arms: 8 [2.9%] osimertinib, 4 (2.9%) 
chemotherapy, with the majority of events in each arm of mild or moderate severity. 
Infections in the pooled Phase II studies 
Infection was not evaluated as a grouped term in the pooled Phase II studies. 
Within the Infections and Infestations MedDRA SOC, AEs were reported in 243 (59.1%) patients. Incidence 
of specific PTs was consistent between the pooled Phase II studies and AURA3, with the Phase II studies 
reporting the following PTs in ≥3% of patients: paronychia (89 [21.7%] patients vs 16.5% in AURA3), upper 
respiratory tract infection (42 [10.2%] vs 9.3%), nasopharyngitis (40 [9.7%] vs 10.0%), urinary tract 
infection (28 [6.8%] vs 6.1%), pneumonia (19 [4.6%] vs 2.9%), and conjunctivitis (15 [3.6%] vs 3.2%). 
The incidence of AEs of pneumonia in the pooled Phase II studies (4.6%) was similar to that in the 
osimertinib arm of AURA3 (2.9%) 
•  Serious adverse events 
Serious adverse events in AURA3 
Serious AEs were less common in the osimertinib arm than the chemotherapy arm (50 [17.9%] vs 35 
[25.7%] patients), with most events reported in ≤ 2 patients in both treatment arms and no individual PT 
reported in more than 4 patients 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/134310/2017 
Page 78/113 
 
 
 
 
 
Table: Serious adverse events, by preferred term in ≥2 patients in either treatment arm in AURA3 (Safety 
analysis set) 
The most frequently reported SAEs in the osimertinib arm (≥1% of patients) were pulmonary embolism (4 
[1.4%] patients vs. 2 [1.5%] patients in the chemotherapy arm); pneumonia(3 [1.1%] vs. 0 on 
chemotherapy); and dyspnoea (3 [1.1%] vs. 0 on chemotherapy) 
Serious AEs considered to be possibly related to study drug were less common in the osimertinib arm (8 
[2.9%] patients) than the chemotherapy arm (17 [12.5%] patients). The only SAE considered to be possibly 
causally related to osimertinib in more than 1 patient was cardiac failure: 2 (0.7%) patients vs 0 patients in 
the chemotherapy arm. The following SAEs were considered to be possibly causally related to chemotherapy 
in more than 1 patient (vs 0 patients in the osimertinib arm): anaemia (3 [2.2%]), decreased appetite (2 
[1.5%]), and nausea (2 [1.5%]). 
The 2 reported SAEs of road traffic accident (RTA) in the osimertinib arm were not secondary to any specific 
drug related signs or symptoms 
Serious adverse events in pooled Phase II studies 
Serious AEs occurred in a higher percentage of patients in the pooled Phase II studies (26.0%) than in the 
osimertinib arm of AURA3 (17.9%). As in AURA3, pneumonia and pulmonary embolism were the most 
commonly reported PTs, at 2.9% each, reflecting the incidence of these events in advanced NSCLC. 
•  Deaths 
Deaths in AURA3 
Overall 35/279 (12.5%) patients in the osimertinib arm and 26/136 (19.1%) patients in the chemotherapy 
arm died, including those who died during the crossover period (for patients in the chemotherapy arm who 
crossed over to osimertinib after BICR-confirmed disease progression on chemotherapy) or after the 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/134310/2017

follow-up period. The majority of deaths were considered to be related to the disease under investigation 
only: 30 of the 35 (85.7%) in the osimertinib arm vs. 21 of 26 (80.8%) in the chemotherapy arm. 
The 35 deaths that occurred in patients in the osimertinib arm are summarised below: 
•  12 (4.3%) deaths occurred on treatment or during the 28-day follow-up period: 
−  8 (2.9%) due to disease under investigation only 
−  2 (0.7%) due to disease under investigation and an AE: respiratory failure (considered not 
causally related to osimertinib by the Investigator) in Patient E4901302; respiratory failure 
(considered not causally related to osimertinib by the Investigator) in Patient E4901303 
−  2 (0.7%) due to AE only: pneumonitis (possibly causally related) in Patient E6005325; 
ischaemic stroke (considered not causally related to osimertinib by the Investigator) in 
Patient E6201301) 
•  23 (8.2%) deaths occurred after the 28-day follow-up period 
−  22 due to disease under investigation only 
−  1 due to ‘lung failure’ (not reported as an AE) 
9 (6.6%) deaths occurred after the patient crossed-over to the osimertinib arm after  BICR-confirmed 
disease progression on chemotherapy  
Deaths in Phase II studies 
The incidence of death was higher in the Phase II studies (98 [23.8%]) than in the osimertinib arm in AURA3 
(35 [12.5%]), which was expected considering the longer follow-up and unfavourable prognostic of 
advanced NSCLC. Among the 411 patients in Phase II, 
83 (20.2%) patient deaths were considered by the Investigator to be related to only the disease under 
investigation, 9 (2.2%) to be related to the disease under investigation and a fatal AE, and 5 (1.2%) to be 
related to only a fatal AE. Fatal AEs in these 14 patients were as follows (note that some patients had 
multiple fatal AEs): 3 (3.7%) patients each with pneumonia and ILD, and 1 (1.2%) patient each with urinary 
tract infection, failure to thrive, cerebral haemorrhage, cerebrovascular accident, congestive cardiac failure, 
dyspnoea, aspiration pneumonia, pneumonitis, respiratory failure, rectal haemorrhage, and liver disorder. 
Of the 14 deaths due to AEs alone or AEs plus disease under investigation, 4 were considered by the 
Investigator to be possibly related to osimertinib. 
•  Clinical laboratory results 
Haematology in AURA3 
For haemoglobin-related changes reported as AEs (anaemia and haemoglobin decreased), the incidence and 
severity of AEs were lower in the osimertinib arm than in the chemotherapy arm. No CTCAE grade 4 or grade 
5 events were reported in either treatment arm. No serious AE related to haemoglobin reduced were 
reported in the osimertinib arm. In the osimertinib arm, the majority of haemoglobin-related events did not 
require medication and no event required dose modification, interruption or discontinuation. Worsening in 
CTCAE grade shifts in haemoglobin was recorded in a lower proportion of patients in the osimertinib arm 
than in the chemotherapy arm (42.7% vs 79.4%%). 
Adverse events related to a reduction in platelet count (ie, thrombocytopenia and platelet count decreased) 
were reported in a lower proportion of patients in the osimertinib arm vs the chemotherapy arm. Most of the 
events in both treatment arms were reported as CTCAE grade 1. CTCAE grade 3 events were reported in only 
1 (0.4%) patient and no ≥grade 4 was reported in the osimertinib arm, in contrast to the chemotherapy arm, 
in which 8 (5.9%) patients had CTCAE grade 3 and 2 (1.5%) patients had CTCAE grade 4 events reported. 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/134310/2017 
Page 80/113 
 
 
 
No SAEs related to thrombocytopenia or platelet count decreased were reported in either treatment arm.In 
addition, a lower proportion of patients in the osimertinib arm than in the chemotherapy arm reported 
non-serious AEs of bleeding, bruising or haemorrhage concomitantly with platelet count below the LLN: 9 
(3.2% osimertinib vs 8 (5.9%) chemotherapy. 
Adverse events of leukopenia or WBC count decreased were reported in a lower proportion of patients in the 
osimertinib arm compared to the chemotherapy arm: 22 (7.9%) vs 20 (14.7%). Most patients in both 
treatment arms had events that were CTCAE grade 1 or grade 2. There were no CTCAE ≥grade 3 AEs or SAEs 
in the osimertinib arm. In the chemotherapy arm, 4 (1.4%) patients had CTCAE grade 3 AEs and 1 (0.7%) 
had a CTCAE grade 4 SAE of leukopenia. In the osimertinib arm, 22 (7.9%) patients experienced 35 events 
with leukopenia changes and in the chemotherapy arm, 20 (14.7%) patients experienced 43 events with 
leukopenia changes. 
Adverse events relating to neutrophil changes (neutropenia and neutrophil count decreased) were reported 
in a lower proportion of patients in the osimertinib arm compared to the chemotherapy arm: 22 (7.9%) vs 
31 (22.8%). Adverse events of neutropenia were reported in a lower proportion of patients in the osimertinib 
arm than in the chemotherapy arm: 10 (3.6%) vs 18 (13.2%). One (0.4%) patient in the osimertinib arm 
and 5 (3.7%) in the chemotherapy arm had a CTCAE grade 3 AE of neutropenia. In the osimertinib arm no 
patients had a CTAE grade 4 event and none had neutropenia reported as an SAE. Adverse events of febrile 
neutropenia were not reported in patients in the osimertinib arm vs 2 (1.5%) patients in the chemotherapy 
arm. Worsening in CTCAE grade shifts in neutrophil values were reported in a lower proportion of patients in 
the osimertinib arm (27.0% vs 48.9%). In the osimertinib arm, at a population level, a decrease from 
baseline in neutrophil count (median: 4.9 x 10^9/L) was seen from Cycle 1 Day 8 onwards (median: 3.89 x 
10^9/L), which stabilised over time. 
Haematology in AURA Phase II studies 
As in AURA3, in the Phase II studies, decreases from baseline in median values for platelets, neutrophils and 
leukocytes were observed early during treatment with osimertinib and appeared to stabilise after the initial 
drop. The majority of patients experienced either no change in CTCAE grade or a 1‐grade shift. 
The most commonly reported haematology-related AE, reported under the Blood and lymphatic disorders 
SOC was anaemia (58/411 (14.1% patients). Among these 58 patients, 25/58 (43.1%) reported events of 
CTCAE grade 1 and 23/58 (39.7%) reported events of CTCAE grade 2. In 10 (17.2%) of the 58 patients, the 
anaemia was CTCAE grade 3. 
•  Safety in special groups and situations 
Effect of gender in AURA3 
Assessment of the safety profile by gender showed alignment with the overall safety profile. 
The overall incidence of AEs was similar across male (N=107) and female (N=172) patients (both >97%). 
Adverse events of CTCAE ≥grade 3 were more frequent among males (28.0%) vs females (19.2%), as were 
SAEs (21.5% males vs 15.7% females). The 2 groups were similar in terms of the most commonly reported 
PTs, with diarrhoea, decreased appetite, fatigue, nausea, constipation, stomatitis, dry skin, cough, 
vomiting, paronychia, and pruritus reported in >10% of each group. There were no PTs with a >10-pp 
difference, although there was a doubling of incidence between genders for the PT of headache (4.7% 
males, 13.4% females). 
None of the grouped terms of interest (Skin Effects, ILD/pneumonitis, or Cardiac Effects [cardiac failure] had 
a difference of >10 pp between male and female patients, although there was a numerical difference in Skin 
Effects (grouped term): 56.1% malesvs 46.5% females. 
Effect of gender in pooled Phase II studies  
Assessment report

Consistent with AURA3, the overall incidence of AEs was similar across male (N=133) and female (N=278) 
patients (both >97%). 
Effect of age in AURA3 
An assessment of the safety profile of osimertinib at the AE category level in patients aged <65 years 
(N=165), 65-74 years (N=72) and ≥75 years (N=42) showed alignment with the overall safety profile. 
Table: Adverse events in any category, by age group at baseline among patients in the osimertinib arm in 
AURA3 (Safety analysis set) 
The 2 groups were similar in terms of the most commonly reported PTs, with the following PTs reported in 
>10% of each group: diarrhoea, nausea, decreased appetite, constipation, fatigue, dry skin, and 
paronychia. There was at least a 10-pp difference in incidence among patients <65 years, patients 65-74 
years, and patients ≥75 years of age in the following PTs: cough (15.8%, 23.6%, 7.1%, respectively), 
pruritus (<10%, 22.2%, <10%), stomatitis (18.8%, 11.1%, and 4.8%), and anaemia (4.2%, 6.9%, and 
16.7%). Among the grouped terms of interest (Skin Effects, ILD/pneumonitis, Cardiac Effects [cardiac 
failure]) a doubling of incidence between any 2 of the age groups was seen in Cardiac Effects (cardiac 
failure) (1.8% in <65, 4.2% in 65-74, and 7.1% in ≥75%). 
Effect of age in the pooled Phase II studies 
Consistent with AURA3, the overall incidence of AEs was similar (>98%) across the 3 age groups: patients 
<65 years of age (N=224), patients 65-75 years of age (N=133) and patients >75 years of age (N=54). The 
incidence of AEs of CTCAE ≥grade 3 considered by the Investigator to be possibly causally related to 
osimertinib was higher in patients >75 (24.1%) than in patients <65 (10.3%) or those 65-75 (15.0%), while 
the incidence of SAEs considered at least possibly causally related to osimertinib was higher in patients 
65-75 (9.8%) than in patients <65 (3.1%) or those >75 (5.6%).

Effect of comorbidity of hypertension in AURA3  
Assessment of the safety profile of osimertinib at the AE category level among patients with a co-morbidity 
of hypertension (N=87) and those with no hypertension (N=192) showed alignment with the overall safety 
profile.  
The overall incidence of AEs was similar between the 2 groups; although AEs of CTCAE grade 3 or higher 
were more frequent for patients with hypertension than for patients without hypertension (27.6% vs 
20.3%). The 2 groups were similar in terms of the most commonly reported PTs, with the following PTs 
reported in >10% of each group: diarrhoea, nausea, decreased appetite, fatigue, constipation, cough, dry 
skin, pruritus, dermatitis acneiform, and paronychia. No PT had a >10-pp difference in incidence between 
patients with a co-morbidity of hypertension and those without. None of the grouped terms of interest (Skin 
Effects, ILD/pneumonitis, or Cardiac Effects [cardiac failure]) had a difference of at least a 10 pp between 
the 2 hypertension groups, although AEs in the Skin Effects grouped term were reported for 43.7% of 
patients with co- morbidity of hypertension vs 53.1% of patients with no co-morbidity.  
Effect of comorbidity of hypertension in the pooled Phase II studies 
Consistent with AURA3, the overall incidence of AEs was similar (>98%) between patients with a 
comorbidity of hypertension (N=146) and patients without comorbidity of hypertension (N=265). There 
were no notable differences between the 2 groups in any of the categorical parameters. 
Among the most common AEs (>10% frequency) the only PTs for which there was at least a 10-pp 
difference or a doubling of incidence between patients with hypertension vs those without hypertension was 
AST increase (4.8% vs 10.6%, respectively), and vomiting (6.8% vs 15.8%). 
Effect of baseline renal function and renal related AEs in AURA3 
Study exclusion criteria mandated that patients with creatinine>1.5 times ULN concurrent with creatinine 
clearance <50 mL/min were to be excluded from being enrolled, as severe renal impairment may influence 
the elimination of renally-eliminated medicinal products. 
A reduced design severe renal impairment study is planned and will be submitted at a later date. 
Overall, the safety profile of osimertinib was similar in patients with normal renal function (N=115), mild 
renal impairment (N=113), or moderate renal impairment (N=48). 
Adverse events in the Renal and Urinary Disorders SOC occurred in 21 (7.5%) patients in the osimertinib 
arm and 8 (5.9%) patients in the chemotherapy arm. Events were CTCAE grade 1 in 15 (5.4%) patients in 
the osimertinib arm and 5 (3.7%) patients in the chemotherapy arm, and grade 2 in 5 (1.8%) and 3 (2.2%), 
respectively. CTCAE grade 3 events were reported in 1 (0.4%) patient in the osimertinib arm and 0 in the 
chemotherapy arm. Dose reductions occurred in 2 (1.5%) patients with CTCAE grade 1 AEs of renal 
impairment in the chemotherapy arm. The majority of renal-related AEs in the Investigations SOC were AEs 
of blood creatinine increased (13 [4.7%] osimertinib, 8 [5.9%] chemotherapy), all of which were CTCAE 
grade 1 or grade 2. Evaluation of renal toxicity did not show any association between osimertinib treatment 
and renal impairment. In the osimertinib arm, a small number of patients had AEs of creatinine increase (13 
[4.7%] patients), which were mostly low grade in severity. None of the osimertinib patients had CTCAE ≥
grade 3 creatinine increased. 
Patients with grade shifts in creatinine were identified by applying the CTCAE version 4.0 definition of 
creatinine increases. CTCAE grade shifts in creatinine (hyper) from baseline were seen in the majority of 
patients during treatment: 269 (96.4%) patients in the osimertinib arm and 113 (86.3%) patients in the 
chemotherapy arm. A total of 238 (85.3%) patients in the osimertinib arm and 98 (74.8%) in the 
chemotherapy arm had a 1 grade shift; 31 (11.1%) and 15 (11.5%), respectively, had a 2-grade shift. No 
patients experienced a 3- or 4-grade shift

Effect of baseline hepatic function and hepatic AEs in AURA3 
A hepatic impairment study (D5160C00008) is ongoing and will be submitted at a later date. 
Overall, the safety profile of osimertinib was similar in patients with normal hepatic function (N=248) or mild 
hepatic impairment (N=25). The 2 groups were similar in terms of the most commonly reported PTs, with 
the following PTs reported in >10% of each group: diarrhoea, nausea, decreased appetite, fatigue, cough, 
stomatitis, dry skin, paronychia, headache, and nasopharyngitis. There was a >10-pp difference or a 
doubling in incidence between groups in 2 PTs: diarrhoea (40.3% in patients with normal function vs 52.0% 
in patients with mild impairment), and constipation (15.3% normal vs 4.0% mild impairment) 
Adverse events in the Hepatobiliary Disorders SOC were reported in 7 patients (2.5%) in the osimertinib arm 
and 8 patients (5.9%) in the chemotherapy arm. In the osimertinib arm, PTs included hepatic function 
abnormal (3 patients [1.1%]); and cholecystitis chronic, hepatotoxicity, hyperbilirubinaemia, and 
hypertransaminasaemia (1 patient [0.4%] each). The majority of hepatobiliary AEs were CTCAE grade 1 in 
severity (osimertinib, 5 patients [1.8%]; chemotherapy, 7 patients [5.1%]). Three hepatobiliary AEs were 
CTCAE grade 3 in severity: 2 patients (0.7%) in the osimertinib arm had CTCAE grade 3 cholecystitis chronic 
and hypertransaminasaemia (1 patient [0.4%] each); and 1 patient (0.7%) in the chemotherapy arm had 
CTCAE grade 3 hepatic function abnormal. One of these CTCAE grade 3 events (hypertransaminasaemia) led 
to osimertinib dose interruption. 
Table: Adverse events related to hepatic function in the investigations system organ class in AURA3 (Safety 
analysis set) 
Hepatic parameters were unchanged from baseline in the majority of patients during treatment. The 
majority of the changes from baseline were shifts of 1 or 2 grades. Only 3 patients in the osimertinib arm had 
a 3-grade shift in AST and/or ALT. No patient had any 3-grade shift in bilirubin or alkaline phosphatase. No 
potential cases of Hy’s law were identified. No patient on osimertinib had ALT or AST ≥3 × ULN and total 
bilirubin ≥2 × ULN at any time during the study. 
Effect of smoking status in AURA3 
Overall, there were no notable differences between Never smokers (N=189) and Former smokers (N=76). 
Compared with the other 2 groups, Current smokers had a higher incidence of AEs causally related to 
osimertinib (92.9% vs 83.6% for Never smokers and 78.9% for Former smokers) and a lower incidence of 
AEs at CTCAE ≥grade 3 (7.1% vs 21.7% for Never smokers and 27.6% for Former smokers). Of note, the “
Current smoker” group has included only 14 patients so differences mentioned above may due to variability

driven by the small number of patients in this sub-group. The 3 groups were similar in terms of the most 
commonly reported PTs, with diarrhoea, constipation, dry skin, and paronychia reported in >10% of each 
group. There was a >10-pp difference or a doubling in incidence between groups in the following PTs, with 
no clear pattern of higher incidence in any 1 group: diarrhoea (39.7% in Never Smokers, 39.5% in Former 
Smokers, and 57.1% in Current Smokers), nausea (18.0%, 13.2%, 7.1%), decreased appetite (19.0%, 
17.1%, 7.1%), cough (20.1%, 10.5%, 0%), vomiting (11.1%, 13.2%, 0%), paronychia (16.9%, 11.8%, 
35.7%), headache (11.1%, 7.9%, 7.1%). 
None of the grouped terms of interest (Skin Effects, ILD/pneumonitis, or Cardiac Effects [cardiac failure]) 
had a >10 pp difference between the 3 smoking status groups or a clinically relevant doubling of incidence 
among the groups 
Effect of smoking status in the pooled Phase II studies 
In the pooled Phase II studies, smoking status was reported as Never (N=294) vs Ever (N=117). Consistent 
with AURA3, the overall incidence of AEs was similar (>97%) between the 2 groups. There were no notable 
differences between the 2 groups in any of the categorical parameters. Among the most common AEs 
(>10% frequency), no PT had a 10-pp difference or a doubling of incidence between Never Smokers and 
Ever Smokers. 
•  Discontinuations, dose reductions and dose interruptions/delays 
Discontinuations due to adverse events in AURA3 
Adverse events led to permanent discontinuation of a lower proportion of patients in the osimertinib arm 
than in the chemotherapy arm: 19 (6.8%) vs 14 (10.3%). 
Of the patients who discontinued study treatment due to AEs, the Investigator considered the event to be 
possibly causally related to study drug in a lower proportion of patients in the osimertinib arm than in the 
chemotherapy arm: 10 (3.6%) vs 12 (8.8%). 
Table: Adverse events leading to discontinuation of study drug in more than 1% of patients in either 
treatment group in AURA3, by preferred term (Safety analysis set) 
Discontinuations due to adverse events in Phase II studies 
The proportion of patients who discontinued due to AEs was similar between the pooled Phase II studies and 
the osimertinib arm in AURA3 (26 [6.3%] and 19 [6.8%] patients, respectively). ILD was the most common 
AE that led to discontinuation (6 [1.5%] patients), followed by pneumonitis (5 [1.2%]), cerebrovascular

accident and pulmonary embolism (2 [0.5%] patients each), and lung infection, pneumonia, decreased 
appetite, failure to thrive, cerebral infarction, cognitive disorder, embolic cerebral infarction, dyspnoea, 
hypoxia, diarrhoea, vomiting, drug-induced liver injury, rash maculopapular, back pain, neck pain, asthenia, 
and neutrophil count decreased (1 [0.2%] patient each). 
Dose reductions due to adverse events in AURA3 
A smaller proportion of patients in the osimertinib arm than in any component of the chemotherapy arm 
required dose reductions: 8 (2.9%) osimertinibvs 17/136 (12.5%) pemetrexed, 12/42 (28.6%) cisplatin, 
and 10/94 (10.6%) carboplatin. There was no evidence of a single type of toxicity causing dose reductions, 
with only the PT of diarrhoea leading to dose reduction in more than 1 patient in the osimertinib arm (2 
[0.7%] patients) 
Dose reductions due to adverse events in the pooled Phase II studies 
Dose reductions due to AEs in the pooled Phase II studies (3.9%) were consistent with those in AURA3 
(2.9%). Events (PTs) leading to dose reduction included electrocardiogram QT prolonged (3 [0.7%]), 
thrombocytopenia (2 [0.5%] patients), and paronychia, neutropenia, decreased appetite, dehydration, 
keratitis, nausea, vomiting, rash, myalgia, fatigue, ejection fraction decreased, lymphocyte count 
decreased, platelet count decreased, and WBC count decreased (1 [0.2%] patient each) 
Dose interruptions or delays due to adverse events in AURA3 
Given that osimertinib was dosed continuously while chemotherapy was administered once every 21 days, 
dose interruption of osimertinib and dose delay of chemotherapy cannot be compared side by side. However, 
both AEs leading to dose interruption and AEs leading to dose delay provide an indication of management of 
toxicities.  
Adverse events with an action taken of dose interruption were reported in 36 (12.9%) patients in the 
osimertinib arm. Of the 36 patients who required dose interruptions due to AEs, 29 (80.1%) patients did not 
have subsequent dose reductions for the same AE or discontinue due to that AE, 5 patients had subsequent 
dose reductions for the same AE without subsequent dose discontinuation,  
1 patient had subsequent dose reduction followed by dose discontinuation for the same AE (Patient 
E7404302, cardiac failure), and 1 patient had subsequent dose discontinuation without dose reduction. 
There did not appear to be any single AE driving the interruption rate in the osimertinib arm, as only 5 events 
led to dose interruption in more than 1 patient: ECG QT prolonged (5 [1.8%]), AST increased (3 [1.1%]), 
and neutropenia, ALT increased, GGT increased, and pneumonia (2 [0.7%] patients each); with the 
exception of the 2 events of pneumonia, all these events were considered by the Investigator to be possibly 
causally related to osimertinib. 
In contrast, in the chemotherapy arm, delays in dosing due to AEs occurred in 28/136 (20.6%) patients 
receiving pemetrexed, 5/42 (11.9%) receiving cisplatin, and 15/94 (16.0%) receiving carboplatin. 
Dose interruptions due to adverse events in Phase II studies 
Adverse events led to dose interruption in a higher percentage of patients in the pooled Phase II studies than 
in the osimertinib arm of AURA3: 87 (21.2%) vs 36 (12.9%) patients, respectively. 
There was no consistent pattern in the type of AE leading to dose interruption, with the following AEs leading 
to interruption in ≥3 patients: electrocardiogram QT prolonged (8 [1.9%]), ALT increased and neutrophil 
count increased (6 [1.5%] each), neutropenia (5 [1.2%]), pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infection, 
diarrhoea, and AST increased (4 [1.0%] each), and leukopenia and thrombocytopenia (3 [0.7%] patients 
each) interruption.

•  Post-marketing data 
Post-marketing data have been summarized in the first PBRER that included data from 13 November 2015 
to 12 May 2016. In this PBRER, the total cumulative post-marketing exposure to osimertinib for all doses and 
all countries as of 30 April 2016 was 672.8 patient- years 
In the PBRER period from first launch 13 November 2015 to 12 May 2016, the majority of post-marketing 
cases received were in keeping with the patient population being treated and the known safety profile of 
Tagrisso. A complete breakdown of events by SOC is provided in the PBRER (see Appendix 2 of the PBRER 
in Module 5.3.6). The most frequently reported events were from the Gastrointestinal Disorders SOC 
(n=49), the majority of which were non- serious (n=31) and consisted largely of reports of dyspepsia 
(n=18, of which 13 were non- serious). There were also 48 events from the General Disorders and 
Administration Site Conditions SOC, of which 26 were non-serious, with the most frequently reported events 
being death (n=8) and non-serious fatigue (n=7). A total of 37 events were reported from the Respiratory, 
Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders SOC, of which the most frequently reported was dyspnoea (n=11, 
including 8 non-serious reports). 
No severe ocular surface effects such as ulcerative keratitis or corneal perforation have been seen to date in 
osimertinib trials. Post-marketing data have been summarized in the first PBRER that included data from 13

November 2015 to 12 May 2016 (see PBRER in Module 5.3.6). Since first approval of osimertinib 
monotherapy (13 November 2015), 
1 report of corneal ulcer from marketed use (Case number 2016SE11972, a non-serious event, with 
unknown outcome; the action taken with osimertinib is unknown); and 2 reports (case numbers 
2015SF29918 and 2016SE48153) of serious keratitis (considered medically important) from a 
compassionate use programme of osimertinib (both serious events considered to be related to osimertinib 
by the reporter; 1 event was recovering at the time of reporting and the other recovered) have been 
reported in the AstraZeneca global safety database. Based on an evaluation of all available data as of July 
2016 according to AstraZeneca internal processes, keratitis (defined by MedDRA grouped terms: keratitis, 
punctate keratitis, corneal erosion, corneal epithelium defect, and corneal defect) was established as 
causally associated with osimertinib. Consequently, keratitis has been added to the osimertinib CDS in the 
Warnings and Precautions section as uncommon ADR, with a frequency of 0.7%. 
No further changes to the reference safety information have been made since marketing approval of 
osimertinib. 
4.4.3.  Discussion 
The safety assessment is mainly based on 415 patients from the AURA3 study (DCO for PFS of 15 April 
2016). In addition, safety data from the 411 patients in the pooled Phase II studies at DCO3 (1 November 
2015) are also used. Lastly, two others pooled database provide further characterisation of the safety profile 
of osimertinib (patients randomised to receive 80 mg osimertinib as ≥second-line therapy; n=833 and all 
patients, all doses, all lines of therapy; n = 1092). 
Study AURA3 
Overall, the safety profile of osimertinib appears better than that reported for chemotherapy within the 
AURA3 study. There were less AEs grade 3 or higher (regardless of causality), SAEs and AEs leading to 
discontinuations.  
At the time of the DCO for PFS (15 April 2016), 166/279 (59.5%) patients were still on treatment in the 
osimertinib arm and 16/136 (11.8%) were still on treatment in the chemotherapy arm of AURA3. Therefore, 
an update from AURA3 study is warranted. 
Median exposure was 8.1 months (range: 0.2-18.5) in the osimertinib arm, whereas in the chemotherapy 
arms, the median exposure was 4.2 months. In those patients who received pemetrexed as maintenance 
(53.7%) the median maintenance duration was 3.1 months. 
There were no big differences in the percentages of patients with AEs between osimertinib and 
chemotherapy arms (97.8% vs 135 99.3% respectively). Adverse events were most frequently reported (
≥50% of patients) in the SOCs of Gastrointestinal (189 [67.7%] patients), Skin & Subcutaneous Tissue 
Disorders (159 [57.0%] and Infections and Infestations (142 [50.9%] in the osimertinib arm. The profile of 
adverse events of oximertinib is mainly characterised (>15% of patients) by diarrhoea (40.5%); dry skin 
(18.6%); decreased appetite (17.9%); paronychia and cough (16.5% each); nausea (16.1%); and fatigue 
(15.8%). This toxicity contrasts with that observed for the chemotherapy, where nausea (49.3%); 
decreased appetite (36.0%); constipation (34.6%); fatigue (27.9%); anaemia (27.9%); vomiting (19.9%); 
and platelet count decreased and stomatitis (15.4%each) were the most frequent AEs (>15% of patients). 
Diarrhoea (40.5% on osimertinib vs. 11.0% on chemotherapy), dry skin (18.6% vs. 4.4%, respectively), 
paronychia (16.5% vs. 1.5%), and dermatitis acneiform (12.9% vs. 2.2%) were the AEs where the 
treatment with osimertinib was clearly worse than chemotherapy, whereas nausea (16.1% on osimertinib 
vs. 49.3% on chemotherapy), decreased appetite (17.9% vs. 36.0%, respectively), constipation (14.0% vs. 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/134310/2017 
Page 91/113 
 
 
 
34.6%), fatigue (15.8% vs. 27.9%), anaemia (6.8% vs. 27.9%), and platelet count decreased (4.3% vs. 
15.4%) were worse for the chemotherapy arm. 
Regarding the severity of AEs, grade ≥ 3 were more frequently reported in the chemotherapy arm (22.6% 
vs47.1%). Pulmonary embolism, decreased appetite, dyspnoea, diarrhoea, asthenia, fatigue, ALT 
increased, AST increased, and neutrophil count decreased, were the most frequently AEs grade 3 or higher 
associated to the use of osimertinib. However, the frequency was around 1%. 
ILD-like events, cardiac events, skin effects, diarrhoea, upper GI tract inflammatory effects, nail effects, 
ocular effects, thromboembolic events, haemorrhages, and infections, have been identified as AEs of special 
interest.  
ILD-like events had a greater incidence in the osimertinib arm than in the chemotherapy (3.6% vs 0.7%). 3 
out of 10 patients (event rate, 4.91 per 100 patient-years) with ILD were considered SAEs (no grade 3 or 4). 
There was a fatal outcome reported in one patient in the osimertinib arm. 
Adverse events in the overall Cardiac Effects (QT) grouped term were reported in 12 (4.3%) patients in the 
osimertinib arm vs 6 (4.4%) patients in the chemotherapy arm. However, Adverse events in the Torsade de 
Pointes/QT prolongation SMQ category were reported in 10 (3.6%) patients in the osimertinib arm and 1 
(0.7%) patient in the chemotherapy arm, even though neither arrhythmias nor TdP were reported. QT 
prolongation is considered an important identified risk for osimertinib and it is clearly reflected in the SPC. 
Regarding the rest of cardiac effects, they were reported as ejection fraction decreased in 6 (2.2%) patients 
(5 CTCAE grade 2 and 1 CTCAE grade 3); cardiac failure in 3 (1.1%) patients (2 CTCAE grade 2 and 1 CTCAE 
grade 3); and pulmonary oedema in 1 (0.4%) patient (CTCAE grade 2). Fourteen (5.0%) patients in the 
osimertinib arm and no patients in the chemotherapy arm had a LVEF decrease ≥10 pp from baseline to a 
LVEF value of <50%. The longer treatment exposure on the osimertinib arm, and the higher frequency of 
cardiac co-morbidities in the osimertinib arm, could be argued as confusion factors when it comes to 
explaining these imbalances cardiac contractility. Even though a clear relationship cannot be firmly 
established, the absence of that cannot be fully ruled out. In this regard, a special warning into the section 
4.4 has been included, recommending cardiac monitoring and assessment of LVEF at baseline and during 
treatment (in patients with cardiac risk factors and those with conditions that can affect LVEF). 
Within the rest of AEs of special interest, it should be noted diarrhoea, reported in 40.5% of patients treated 
with osimertinib (55.48 per 100 patient-years), but without SAEs or CTCAE grade 4 or grade 5. The 
prevalence of diarrhoea remained relatively constant over the duration of treatment, with approximately 
15% of patients experiencing diarrhoea at any one point. Almost 29% of the events of diarrhoea required 
supportive medication. No information about the duration of diarrhoea according to the severity has been 
submitted. 
Serious AEs were less common in the osimertinib arm than the chemotherapy arm (50 [17.9%] patients vs. 
35 [25.7%] patients, respectively). The most frequently reported SAEs in the osimertinib arm (≥1% of 
patients) were pulmonary embolism (4 [1.4%] patients vs. 2 [1.5%] patients in the chemotherapy arm); 
pneumonia(3 [1.1%] vs. 0 on chemotherapy); and dyspnoea (3 [1.1%] vs. 0 on chemotherapy).  
Overall 35 (12.5%) patients in the osimertinib arm and 26 (18.6%) patients in the chemotherapy arm died, 
including those who died during the crossover period. However, in the osimertinib arm, 12/279 (4.3%) 
deaths occurred on treatment or during the 28-day follow-up period, whereas in the chemotherapy arm 4 
/136 (2.9%) deaths occurred on treatment or during the 28-day follow-up period. This apparently greater 
incidence of deaths in the osimertinib arm were majority due to disease progression and the same 
percentage of deaths was found (0.7%) in the category of “due to the disease under investigation and an 
AE”.  
Dose modifications (interruptions or reduction to 40 mg) were reported in 76 (27.2%) patients on 
osimertinib, and 19 (6.8%) patients discontinued osimertinib due to AEs. Dose modifications (delays or dose

reductions) were reported in 65 (47.8%) patients for pemetrexed, 25 (59.5%) patients for cisplatin, and 35 
(37.2%) patients for carboplatin in the chemotherapy arm; 14 (10.3%) patients discontinued chemotherapy 
due to AEs. 
Adverse events in the Renal and Urinary Disorders SOC occurred in 21 (7.5%) patients in the osimertinib 
arm (most of which were mild in severity) and 8 (5.9%) patients in the chemotherapy arm. The overall 
toxicity of osimertinib seems similar according to the different subgroups of renal impairment. Of note, a 
severe renal impairment study is planned. 
Adverse events in the Hepatobiliary Disorders SOC were reported in 7 (2.5%) patients in the osimertinib arm 
and 8 (5.9%) patients in the chemotherapy arm. No important safety differences were observed between 
normal and mild hepatic impairment. A hepatic impairment study (D5160C00008) is ongoing 
Low-grade decreases from baseline in median values for platelets, neutrophils, and leukocytes were 
observed early in treatment with osimertinib. Median values appeared to stabilise after the initial drop, with 
the majority of patients experiencing no change in CTCAE grade or a single grade change. 
Safety profile in males and females was overall similar, but with more AEs grade 3 or higher and SAEs in 
males. Patients older than 75 years had a greater incidence of AEs grade 3 or higher, SAEs, and SAEs-AEs 
leading to discontinuation.  
Phase II studies 
Overall, toxicity and tolerability were comparable to the findings from the AURA3 study. It seems that the 
additional 6 months of follow-up in the phase II studies did not reveal new worrisome AEs. 
Conclusion 
The safety profile of osimertinib seems consistent to that previously reported from phase II studies. Overall, 
the tolerability of osimertinib appears manageable and better tolerated than chemotherapy when AEs grade 
3 or higher, SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation, are bearing in mind. 
4.5.  Risk management plan 
The RMP has been updated throughout to include information from the AURA3 study. The MAH has 
submitted an updated RMP version 6.0.   
Summary of safety concerns 
The MAH identifies the following safety concerns, with the newly included safety concern of ‘changes to 
cardiac contractility’. The MAH also proposes to change the safety concern “Ocular toxicity” into “Severe 
ocular effects” 
Table 1: Summary of safety concerns

Summary of safety concerns 
- Use during lactation 
- Use in patiets with severe renal impairment 
- Use in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment 
- Use in patients with ECOG performance status ≥2 
- Use in patients with symptomatic brain metastases 
- Potential for drug-drug interactions with non-CYP3A4 mediated PXR substrates 
- Potential for transporter inhibition 
- Potential for P-gp inhibition 
- Use in very elderly patients (≥75 years old) 
The MAH proposes to add ‘Changes in cardiac contractility’ to the list of safety concerns. In the AURA3 study 
a numerical imbalance in the number of patients with an AE from the Cardiac Failure SMQ or 
Cardiomyopathy SMQ and in LVEF decreases between the 2 treatment arms was noted. The MAH states that 
this is most likely due to the 2:1 randomisation in favour of osimertinib.     
There is evidence from in vitro pharmacology studies that osimertinib inhibits HER2 in cancer cell lines, and 
HER2 inhibition has been associated with the risk of a decrease in LVEF in some patients receiving 
trastuzumab following anthracycline-based therapy. However, further analyses of LVEF in more recent HER2 
small molecule inhibitors shows the link between HER2 inhibition and LVEF decrease is not conclusive. 
Further information is needed, and it is agreed to include ‘changes in cardiac contractility’ as an important 
potential risk in the RMP. 
The MAH proposes to change the important potential risk ‘ocular toxicity’ to ‘severe ocular effects’. As it is 
not toxicity in general that is considered an important potential risk, but the possible serious effects to the 
eye. These serious effects have not yet been observed to date; however mild ocular effects (keratitis) have 
been observed. The change in the name of this safety concern is accepted.  
Having considered the updated data in the safety specification the PRAC Rapporteur agrees that the safety 
concerns listed by the MAH are appropriate. 
Pharmacovigilance Plan 
Concerning the safety concern ‘changes in cardiac contractility’, the MAH proposes to use data from the 
ongoing FLAURA study in patients not previously exposed to cytotoxic treatments to obtain additional 
information. This is accepted. The FLAURA study was already part of the Pharmacovigilance Plan as a 
category 3 study.  
Relevant information on cardiac contractibility from other ongoing studies should be included in the further 
analysis of this safety concern as well.

4.6.  Changes to the Product Information 
As a result of this group of variations, sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 are being updated based on the 
results from study D5160C00003 (AURA3) and the updated CSRs for studies D5160C00001 (AURAex) and 
D5160C00002 (AURA2). The Package Leaflet is being updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to make editorial changes in the SmPC and Package Leaflet.  
The provision of the CSR from study AURA3 addressed the remaining Specific Obligation for Tagrisso and 
hence the MAH requested the conversion from a Conditional Marketing Authorisation to a Marketing 
Authorisation not subject to Specific Obligations. Annex II has been updated in accordance.  
Please refer to Attachment 1 which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information.

6.  Assessment of responses to Request for Supplementary 
Information 
Question 1 
Results from AURA3 trial confirm the previous positive benefit risk balance shown on the basis 
of AURA extension and AURA2 however, data on OS should be submitted before a full marketing 
authorisation can be granted. 
Response: 
Results of the first overall survival (OS) analysis, with a data cut-off of 02 September 2016 (DCO2), are 
provided to fulfil the Specific Obligation associated with the Conditional Marketing Authorisation. 
At the time of the initial OS analysis (2 September 2016), 109/419 patients overall had died, including 69 
(24.7%) patients in the osimertinib arm and 40 (28.6%) patients in the chemotherapy arm. Thus the 
maturity of the OS was low (26.0%). There was a numerical advantage in OS for patients on osimertinib 
compared to patients on chemotherapy, which did not reach statistical significance (HR: 0.72 [99.96% CIs: 
0.34, 1.52]; p-value = 0.121). The median OS was not calculable in either arm due to the low number of 
deaths. Based on a KM analysis, at 6 months, the estimated proportion of patients alive was 95.3% (95% 
CI: 92.0, 97.2) in the osimertinib arm vs. 87.8% (95% CI: 80.8, 92.3) in the chemotherapy arm; and at 12 
months, was 83.6% (95% CI: 78.6, 87.6) in the osimertinib arm vs. 76.9% (95% CI: 68.4, 83.3) in the 
chemotherapy arm. The interpretation of the OS results was confounded by the high proportion of patients 
who received at least 1 subsequent systemic anti-cancer therapy post-discontinuation (osimertinib: 34.4%; 
chemotherapy: 76.4%), particularly given that 94/140 (67.1%) of patients randomised to chemotherapy 
subsequently crossed over to receive treatment with osimertinib. 
Overall the numerical advantage observed in OS for osimertinib compared to chemotherapy, in AURA3, even 
in the presence of a high rate of subsequent anti-cancer usage on the chemotherapy arm, provides further 
support for the positive benefit-risk of osimertinib. 
Assessment of the Applicant’s response 
The Applicant has submitted the data for the first OS analysis. As expected, data are not mature enough so 
as to draw firm conclusions about the potential longer survival of those patients treated with osimertinib. 
Although this immature HR is reassuring, highlighting a positive trend for osimertinib (HR: 0.72 [99.96% 
CIs: 0.34, 1.52]) (since 3 OS analyses are planned, the significance level for testing OS was adjusted to 
0.0004; 99.96% CIs are presented) the percentage of events at the cutoff date (24.7% and 28.6% for 
osimertinib and chemotherapy respectively; 2 September 2016) does not allow reaching further conclusions 
from this analysis. . Despite the inability to collect informative mature OS data, the magnitude of effect seen 
with PFS, ORR, DoR and DCR, supported by the reassuring HR in terms of OS in the first analysis, provide 
reassurance. 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/134310/2017 
Page 101/113 
 
 
 
The rates of patients alive at 6 and 12 months in the osimertinib arm (95.3% and 83.6% respectively) seem 
comparable to those previously observed in the pooled data from the phase II studies (91.9% and 79.8%; 
6 and 12 months respectively). 
As stated previously, 3 analyses of OS will be conducted.  A second analysis of OS will be performed when 
the OS data are approximately 50% mature (approximately 205 deaths events).  A third analysis of OS will 
be performed when the OS data are approximately 70% mature (approximately 287 deaths events). 
Nevertheless, it seems doubtful that this expected longer survival can be shown in future analyses, seeing

as 94/140 [67.1%] patients in the chemotherapy arm crossed over to receive treatment with osimertinib 
after RECIST progression.  
Point solved as the first OS analysis has been submitted. 
Question 2 
PFS2 was included as an exploratory endpoint in AURA3 protocol. Data on time from 
randomisation to second progression will help in interpretation of trial results, being especially 
important for the subgroup of patients who received osimertinib after progression on 
chemotherapy arm (60%). The applicant should clarify whether data on PFS2 will be available. 
Response: 
The time from randomisation to second progression (PFS2) was included as an exploratory endpoint in 
AURA3, and was defined as time from the date of randomisation to the earliest date of a progression event 
subsequent to that used for the primary variable PFS, or death in the absence of second disease progression. 
Second progression was determined by the Investigator based on local clinical practice and the 
determination could be made by clinical and/or radiographic assessment of the patient. Patients alive and for 
whom a second disease progression was not observed were censored at the last date they were known to be 
alive and without second disease progression. 
In line with the statistical analysis plan, the post-progression exploratory endpoint of PFS2 as well as time 
from randomisation to first subsequent therapy (TFST) and time from randomisation to second subsequent 
therapy (TSST) have been assessed at the time of the OS analysis (DCO2: 2 September 2016) since these 
endpoints were considered important to the interpretation of OS (Table 1). However, it should be noted that 
following the primary analysis for PFS at DCO1 (15 April 2016), collection of RECIST data was not continued 
and this impacted PFS2; for example the censoring of PFS2, which utilises this data for patients who did not 
have a PFS2 event (ie, in patients without a PFS event and thus who were yet to be assessed for a PFS2 
event). This situation occurred more frequently in the osimertinib arm than in the chemotherapy arm. In the 
osimertinib arm, 139/279 (49.8%) patients did not have a PFS event at DCO1; at DCO2, 121 of the 139 
patients were censored for PFS2 at their PFS censoring date. In chemotherapy arm, 30/140 (21.4%) 
patients did not have a PFS event at DCO1; at DCO2, 25 of the 30 patients were censored for PFS2 at their 
PFS censoring date. 
In addition, per the protocol, patients could remain on their randomised treatment after the first 
RECIST-defined progression if they continued to derive clinical benefit, as judged by the investigator. 
Overall, more patients who had progressed continued to receive their randomised treatment beyond first 
disease progression for at least 7 days in the osimertinib arm compared to the chemotherapy arm (84/279 
[30.1%] patients vs. 14/140 [10.0%] patients, respectively). The median time to discontinuation of therapy 
(TDT) was 13.8 months (95% CI: 12.4, 15.7) in the osimertinib arm and 3.7 months (95% CI: 3.5, 4.4) in 
the chemotherapy arm. 
Assessment of PFS2 was originally intended to describe the time of the first subsequent progression event 
on the first subsequent anti-cancer received after randomised treatment. However, in the osimertinib arm 
only, a number of investigators reported PFS2 while patients were still receiving randomised treatment, 
which was not in line with a general principle of PFS2 reflecting progression on next line of therapy: 
• 
• 
In the osimertinib arm, of the 84 patients who had a second progression event only (other than 
death), 37 (44.0%) patients were still receiving osimertinib treatment at the time of their PFS2 
event; 
In the chemotherapy arm, of the 34 patients who had a second progression event only (other than 
death), no patients were receiving chemotherapy at the time of their PFS2 event 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/134310/2017 
Page 103/113 
 
 
 
The evidence that patients randomised to osimertinib continued beyond second disease progression and 
thus delayed start of next treatment regimen can be further observed by the fact that on the osimertinib arm 
the median PFS2 time is numerically shorter at 13.2 months than both the median time to discontinuation of 
randomised treatment and the median time to start of first subsequent therapy of 13.8 months and 16.9 
months, respectively. 
Overall, the results of PFS2 at DCO2 (2 September 2016) indicated there was no statistical difference 
between treatment arms in second progression-free survival (PFS2); the HR was 1.06 (95% CI: 0.78, 1.43; 
2-sided p value = 0.730). However the analysis of PFS2 at DCO2 was confounded by the large proportion of 
patients in the osimertinib arm who reported an event (PFS2) while still on randomised treatment, and by 
the difference in timing between the PFS2 (DCO2) and PFS (DCO1) analyses, making interpretation 
challenging; therefore PFS2 does not truly reflect time to second progression on the next line of therapy. 
Other post-progression outcomes of time to first subsequent therapy (TFST), and time to second subsequent 
therapy (TSST) assessed at the time of the OS analysis are presented in Table 1 above. In particular, it 
should be noted that the endpoint of TSST could be considered a surrogate of when second progression 
occurs given movement onto next line of therapy typically follows a progression event.

Assessment of the applicant’s response 
The analysis of PFS2 does not reveal any difference between osimertinib arm and chemotherapy group (HR 
1.06; 95% CI: 0.78, 1.43; 2-sided p value = 0.730). This apparently absence of difference could suggest 
altered tumour behaviour after the osimertinib influence or alternatively making more attractive the 
chemo-osimertinib sequence. Nevertheless, a deeper analysis of the data cast important doubts about the 
interpretation of the PFS2 result.  
First of all, PFS2 according to the protocol was defined as time from the date of randomisation to the earliest 
date of a progression event subsequent to that used for the primary variable PFS, or death in the absence of 
second disease progression. This definition is not exactly the same that the anticancer guideline states (time 
from randomisation to objective tumour progression on next-line treatment or death from any cause) where 
a second treatment is included.  
Secondly, the number of patients who were censored was high, mainly due to the lack of PFS event at DCO1 
and as a consequence of that the absence of RECIST data from that point, which led to censure those 
patients without event at first DCO. 
And thirdly, there were many patients who continued the osimertinib treatment even after the 1st 
progression 
All together make difficult to drawn conclusions about PFS2 and the apparently similarity in terms of PFS2 
between the two arms should be taken very cautiously.  
In the end, PFS2 was an exploratory endpoint that could have been useful in this scenario of immature OS 
data, but unfortunately, due to the reasons above described, it resulted in uncertain variable uneasy to 
understand  
Question solved as submitted 
Question 3 
53.7% of patients in the chemotherapy arm went on to receive pemetrexed as maintenance 
therapy. Comparative data (osimertinib arm vs. chemotherapy arm) in terms of the main 
efficacy endpoints (i.e. PFS, ORR and OS) should be submitted for this subgroup of patients. 
Response: 
In the AURA3 study, a total of 419 patients were randomised to treatment: 279 (66.6%) to osimertinib and 
140 (33.4%) to platinum-based doublet chemotherapy. Per the protocol and clinical practice, patients 
whose disease had not progressed after 4 to 6 cycles of platinum- based doublet chemotherapy could 
continue on maintenance monotherapy with pemetrexed according to the approved label use or local 
practice guidelines. Of the 140 patients randomised to the chemotherapy arm, 136 patients received 
treatment and of these 100 (73.5%) patients completed at least 4 cycles of chemotherapy and 73 (53.7%) 
patients went on to receive pemetrexed maintenance monotherapy. Based on the pivotal pemetrexed 
maintenance studies, this represents the proportion of patients expected to continue on pemetrexed 
maintenance (Paz-Ares et al 2012). 
Review of demography by randomised treatment (osimertinib, chemotherapy) and the chemotherapy arm 
split by pemetrexed maintenance status (ie patients did/did not continue pemetrexed) indicated that 
patients who went on to receive pemetrexed maintenance therapy after platinum-based chemotherapy were 
broadly consistent with patients who did not have maintenance therapy. 
Review of disease characteristics at baseline highlighted that patients who went on to receive maintenance 
therapy on the chemotherapy arm had disease characteristics consistent with a better clinical prognosis: 
more patients had performance status 0, compared with all patients randomised to osimertinib and in 
Assessment report

particular compared with patients who did not receive pemetrexed maintenance therapy (49.3%, 36.6% 
and 29.9% respectively); the median sum of baseline target lesion measurements were smaller, compared 
with all patients randomised to osimertinib and in particular compared with patients who did not receive 
pemetrexed maintenance therapy (42.0mm, 46.0mm and 53.0mm respectively). 
There is no prior literature on the efficacy of platinum doublet chemotherapy in patients with T790M positive 
NSCLC in patients whose disease has progressed on prior EGFR TKI therapy. The median PFS with first-line 
platinum doublet in EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC ranges from 4.6 months to 6.9 months, and the ORR 
from 15% to 47%, as summarised in the Clinical Overview. There have been a small number of Phase III 
trials investigating first line platinum doublet chemotherapy in treatment naïve advanced non-squamous 
NSCLC (Paz- Ares et al 2012, Okamoto et al 2014). In the PARAMOUNT study (patients were not selected by 
EGFR mutation status), maintenance pemetrexed following pemetrexed-cisplatin induction resulted in an 
improvement in a median PFS by investigator assessment by 1.3 months (4.1 months versus 2.8 months for 
the placebo arm, Paz-Ares et al 2012. 
It should be noted that any comparison of the osimertinib arm (all randomised patients) with the subset of 
the chemotherapy arm who went on to receive pemetrexed maintenance in this study is biased in favour of 
this pemetrexed maintenance subgroup by the fact that this subgroup is defined by a post-randomisation 
status which requires patients who initially received chemotherapy to: a) did not progress/die up to cycle 4 
of treatment; b) have received at least 4 cycles of platinum treatment (ie no early discontinuation of IP due 
to toxicities); and c) be fit enough to continue pemetrexed maintenance therapy per approved label/local 
practice guidelines. This can be noted by review of the time to event variables, for example the PFS and OS 
Kaplan-Meier curves by treatment status highlight that the pemetrexed maintenance group curve does not 
decline until after cycle 4, ie, the second RECIST assessment. 
The comparative data for the primary efficacy variables are summarised in Table 2 below. Overall 
comparative data comparing the osimertinib arm (all randomised patients) with the subset of the 
chemotherapy arm who went on to receive pemetrexed maintenance is presented in full for the main efficacy 
endpoints (i.e. PFS, ORR and OS).

To summarize the data above and presented in tabular form: 
• 
Patients in the chemotherapy arm who received pemetrexed maintenance therapy had a better 
clinical prognosis than those who did not receive maintenance with regards to a better WHO 
Performance Status and lower baseline disease burden. 
•  Approximately half (52.1%) the patients in the chemotherapy arm received pemetrexed 
maintenance therapy, as expected based on local guidelines. 
-  Median PFS and ORR were longer/greater for the pemetrexed maintenance therapy subgroup 
compared to the no pemetrexed maintenance subset. Median OS data were too immature to 
perform robust comparisons. 
•  Median PFS and ORR were longer/greater on the osimertinib treatment arm compared to the 
pemetrexed maintenance subgroup with no overlap of 95% CIs for either PFS or ORR. Median OS 
data were too immature to perform robust comparisons. 
The data presented above supports that there was a numerical and clinically meaningful advantage in 
efficacy outcomes for patients who were randomised to receive osimertinib even when compared to a better 
prognostic subgroup of pemetrexed maintenance. 
Assessor’s comment 
Despite the biases associated to this analysis, it results interesting (in a certain way expected) to observe 
the PFS and OS curves for the pemetrexed maintenance group. There does not seem to be doubt that 
osimertinib looks superior to pemetrexed maintenance subset in terms of PFS and ORR. A longer PFS is 
observed for osimertinib especially from month 4th forwards, where a rapid decrease in the PFS curve is seen 
for the maintenance group. However, it should be noted the beginning of the curve, where the osimertinib 
curve is below the maintenance curve, pointing out a greater delay in tumour progression than that 
observed for osimertinib. To what extend the latter can be associated to imbalances in baseline 
characteristics and/or prognostics factors is unknown. Nonetheless, it is worth looking at the OS curve, 
where pemetrexed maintenance group seems to offer a better result. Obviously, the number of events is still 
low and the final picture could change. 
Question solved until final data on OS are available

Question 4 
At the time of the DCO for PFS (15 April 2016), 166/279 (59.5%) patients were still on 
treatment in the osimertinib arm and 16/136 (11.8%) were still on treatment in the 
chemotherapy arm of AURA3. Therefore, a safety update from AURA3 study is warranted. Please 
provide. 
MAH´s Response: 
The AURA3 safety data, at DCO2 (02 September 2016), are provided as an Addendum to the AURA3 CSR in 
Module 5.3.5.1 of the CTD and for the convenience of the reviewer a summary is also appended in 
Appendix D to this response (see Appendix D). 
The majority of patients in the chemotherapy arm had already discontinued chemotherapy at AURA3 DCO1 
(15 April 2016), with only a small proportion of patients (12% as compared to 60% on osimertinib) still 
ongoing on their randomised treatment. The median total exposure to chemotherapy was, therefore, 
unchanged at DCO2 from DCO1, which is reflected in the little to no change in safety variables seen in the 
chemotherapy arm at DCO2: at DCO2, the median exposure increased from DCO1 on osimertinib (11.4 
months vs. 8.1 months, respectively) while it was unchanged on chemotherapy (4.2 months). The increased 
differential in duration of exposure between treatment arms at DCO2 should be considered when reviewing 
the safety and tolerability profile of osimertinib vs. chemotherapy.  
Comparison of the 2 treatment arms at DCO2 confirms the finding from DCO1 (15 April 2016) that 
osimertinib is generally well tolerated and has an acceptable safety profile compared to chemotherapy. 
Adverse events are generally less frequent and less severe in the osimertinib arm than in the chemotherapy 
arm. Osimertinib adverse reactions are generally manageable through supportive care and dose 
interruptions, with fewer requirements for dose reductions or drug discontinuation compared with 
chemotherapy. 
Overall, the osimertinib safety profile in AURA3 as of DCO2 (2 September 2016), with an additional 4 months 
of follow-up, is consistent with that seen at DCO1 (15 April 2016), with no new signals identified. 
Assessment of the applicant response: 
Updated safety data as of the data cut-off of 2 September 2016 has been submitted (last update from 15 
April 2016). Overall, adverse events of any grade were reported in similar proportions of patients in the 2 
treatment arms and as previously observed there was a lower rate AEs grade 3 or higher (regardless of 
causality), causally-related SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuations in the osimertinib arm compared to 
chemotherapy arm.  
At the time of this new DCO for safety (2 September 2016), 45.2% of patients were on osimertinib treatment 
and a small proportion of patients were still on chemotherapy treatment in the osimertinib arm and (3.7%) 
of AURA3.  
Median exposure had increased approximately 3 months from DCO1 in the osimertinib arm (11.4 months vs. 
8.1 months, respectively), while it was unchanged from DCO1 in the chemotherapy arm (4.2 months). 
Whereas no change or very little change is observed in the chemotherapy safety data compared to the 
previous DCO, more matrure data and slightly higher rates of AES are observed on osimertinib treatment. 
The percentages of patients with AEs between osimertinib and chemotherapy arms was similar (97.8% vs 
99.3% respectively) and this proportions remained unchanged from last DCO.  
As previously seen sdverse events were most frequently reported were in the SOCs of Gastrointestinal, Skin 
& Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders and Infections and Infestations in the osimertinib arm.  
Assessment report

The profile of adverse events of osimertinib is mainly characterised (>15% of patients) by diarrhoea 
(41.2%); dry skin (19.0%); decreased appetite (20.4%); paronychia (18.6%)and cough (17.9%); nausea 
(20.1%); and fatigue (17.2%) and constipation (15.4%).  All the rates in the osimertinib arm slightly 
increased from last DCO (the greatest increase of 4% is observed for nausea) .  
The toxicity in the chemotherapy arm continues constrasting with that of osmertinib:  Diarrhoea (41.2% on 
osimertinib vs. 11.0% on chemotherapy), dry skin (19.0% vs. 4.4%, respectively), paronychia (18.6% vs. 
1.5%), and dermatitis acneiform (14% vs. 2.2%) were the AEs where the treatment with osimertinib was 
clearly worse than chemotherapy, whereas nausea (20.1% on osimertinib vs. 49.3% on chemotherapy), 
decreased appetite (20.4% vs. 36.0%, respectively), constipation (15.4% vs. 34.6%), fatigue (17.2% vs. 
28.7%), anaemia (7.9% vs. 27.9%), and platelet count decreased (5.0% vs. 15.4%) were worse for the 
chemotherapy arm. 
Regarding the severity of AEs, grade ≥ 3 were more frequently reported in the chemotherapy arm (29.4% 
vs 47.1%). Pulmonary embolism, ALT increased, diarrhoea, fatigue, decreased appetite, AST increased, 
neutrophil count decreased, asthenia, dyspnoea and  pneumonia were the most frequently AEs grade 3 or 
higher associated to the use of osimertinib. However, the frequency lower than 2% for all of them. 
The overall number of deaths increased from the last DCO. Now 69/279 (24.7%) patients in the osimertinib 
arm died (35/279; 12.5% fromerly) and 40/140 (28.6%) patients in the chemotherapy arm died (18.6% 
formerly), including those who died during the crossover period. As previoulsy observed, the proportion of 
deaths that occurred on treatment or during the 28-day follow-up period is greater for osimertinib (6.5%  vs 
2.9%), whereas  the percentaje of deaths due to disease under investigation only was similar (21.5% 
osimertinib vs. 22.1% placebo) and due to  due to the disease under investigation and an AE a greater 
percentaje is observed in the chemotherapy arm (0.7% vs.  4.3%). 
Serious AEs are now observed in a similar proportion in the osimertinib and chemotherapy arms (65 
[23.3%] patients vs. 35 [25.7%] respectively). The most frequently reported SAEs in the osimertinib arm (
≥1% of patients) were pulmonary embolism (6 [2.2%] patients vs. 2 [1.5%] patients in the chemotherapy 
arm); pneumonia(4 [1.4%] vs. 0 on chemotherapy); and dyspnoea (4 [1.4%] vs. 0 on chemotherapy).  
The common AEs that characterise the osimertinib safety profile (diarrhoea and skin effects) generally did 
not lead to discontinuation of treatment.  
Dose modifications (interruptions or reduction to 40 mg) were reported in 30.8% of patients on osimertinib, 
and 7.9% patients discontinued osimertinib due to AEs. Dose modifications (delays or dose reductions) were 
reported in 48.5% of patients for pemetrexed, 59.5% of patients for cisplatin, and 37.2% of patients for 
carboplatin in the chemotherapy arm; 11.0% of patients discontinued chemotherapy due to AEs. 
Regarding AEs of special interest:  ILD-like events continue to have a greater incidence in the osimertinib 
arm than in the chemotherapy (4.3% vs 1.5%). There were no CTCAE grade 3 or grade 4 events nas  2 fatal 
outcomes were reported in the osimertinib arm.  
Adverse events in the overall Cardiac Effects (QT) grouped term were reported in 13 (4.7%) patients in the 
osimertinib arm vs 6 (4.4%) patients in the chemotherapy arm. Percentajes remain similar to those 
previously seen. 
Adverse events in the Torsade de Pointes/QT prolongation SMQ category were reported in 11 (3.9%) 
patients in the osimertinib arm and 1 (0.7%) patient in the chemotherapy arm, even though neither 
arrhythmiasn or TdP were reported. QT prolongation is considered an important identified risk for 
osimertinib and it is clearly reflected in the SPC. 
Regarding the rest of cardiac effects, they were reported as ejection fraction decreased in 8 (2.9%) patients 
(6 CTCAE grade 2 and 2 CTCAE grade 3); cardiac failure in 3 (1.1%) patients (2 CTCAE grade 2 and 1 CTCAE 
Assessment report

Page 110/113 
 
 
 
grade 3); and pulmonary oedema in 1 (0.4%) patient (CTCAE grade 2).  One of the patients with ejection 
fraction decreased also had an AE of cardiac failure. 
Fifteen (5.4%) patients in the osimertinib arm and no patients in the chemotherapy arm had a LVEF 
decrease ≥10 pp from baseline to a LVEF value of <50%. The longer treatment exposure on the osimertinib 
arm, and the higher frequency of cardiac co-morbidities in the osimertinib arm, could be argued as confusion 
factors when it comes to explaining these imbalances cardiac contractility. Even though a clear relationship 
cannot be firmly established, the absence of that cannot be fully ruled out. In this regard, a special warning 
into the section 4.4 has been included, recommending cardiac monitoring and assessment of LVEF at 
baseline and during treatment (in patients with cardiac risk factors and those with conditions that can affect 
LVEF). 
Within the rest of AEs of special interest, it should be noted diarrhoea, reported in 41.2% of patients treated 
with osimertinib, but without CTCAE grade 4 or grade 5. No events of diarrhoea led to discontinuation of 
treatment in either arm. One patient in each treatment arm had diarrhoea reported as an SAE. CTCAE grade 
3 events of diarrhoea were similar between the 2 treatment groups: 4 (1.4%) patients in the osimertinib 
arm and 2 (1.5%) patients in the chemotherapy arm. There were no events of gastrointestinal (GI) 
perforation or haemorrhagic diarrhoea in either treatment arm. Almost one third (28.4%) of the events of 
diarrhoea required supportive medication. Information about the duration of diarrhoea according to the 
severity has been submitted (please refer to the following question). 
Overall, the updated osimertinib safety profile in AURA3 (DCO 2 September 2016) seems comparable to that 
observed in the previous submissionn of data (15 April 2016) and no new safety signals have been identified. 
At the time of the DCO2 (2 September 2016), 45.2% patients were still on treatment on osimertinib arm of 
AURA3 (only 3.7% in the chemotherapy arm). The applicant should commit to provide safety data update at 
the time of next submission of OS data. 
The MAH made a commitment accordingly. 
Issue resolved 
Question 5 
Diarrhoea was reported in 40.5% of patients treated with osimertinib (55.48 per 100 
patient-years), but without SAEs or CTCAE grade 4 or grade 5. The prevalence of diarrhoea 
remained relatively constant over the duration of treatment, with approximately 15% of 
patients experiencing diarrhoea at any one point. Almost 29% of the events of diarrhoea 
required supportive medication. However, no information about the duration of diarrhoea 
according to the severity has been submitted. Please submit.  
MAH´s Response: 
Overall, the profile for diarrhoea events seen in the osimertinib arm of AURA3 was as expected given the 
improved margin of selectivity that osimertinib has against WT EGFR. Reported events were all non-serious 
and tended to be mild or moderate severity with a low likelihood of clinical sequelae. As discussed below, no 
apparent pattern in duration or resolution of diarrhoea events by severity has been noted. 
At the time of the primary PFS analysis (DCO1: 15th April 2016), 197 diarrhoea events were reported in 
113/279 (40.5%) patients in the osimertinib arm of AURA3. This incidence is consistent with the pooled 
Phase II studies (45.5%). Some individuals may have experienced more than one event (mean number of 
diarrhoea AEs in AURA3 for those patients who reported events was 1.7).

Duration data for all grades, and broken down by maximum CTCAE grade: grade 1 and 2 are presented by 
patient level data and event level data, as well as CTCAE grade 3 diarrhoea events. These tables also include 
diarrhoea event and duration information from the AURA3 chemotherapy arm for comparative purposes. 
The median total duration of all events of diarrhoea was 29 days (range 1 to 467 days). It should be noted 
that calculations also include AEs of intermittent episodes of diarrhoea. The duration of the episodes are 
captured as continuous events and therefore in such instances durations maybe overestimated due to the 
inclusion of days/periods without diarrhoea. 
• 
CTCAE grade 1 events were reported in 96/279 (34.4%) of patients in the osimertinib arm. Median 
total duration was 35 days (range 1 to 467 days) per patient. 
• 
CTCAE grade 2 events were reported in 14/279 (5.0%) patients in the osimertinib arm. Median 
total duration was 5.5 days (range 1 to 253 days) per patient. 
• 
CTCAE grade 3 events were reported in 3/279 (1.1%) patients. These individual events were of 3, 
4 and 19 day’s duration  
• 
There were no SAE or CTCAE grade 4 or 5 events of diarrhoea. No event of diarrhoea led to 
discontinuation of osimertinib.

The median proportion of time on osimertinib treatment with diarrhoea was very low (7%) 
Less than a third (28.4%) of events had treatment for diarrhoea:  
For the 56 events that did receive treatment the median duration of the event was 28.5 days (range 
1 to 467; SD 135.02). At the time of DCO1, 38/56 (67.9%) were reported as resolved, and 18/56 
(32.1%) were reported as ongoing. Antipropulsives were the most commonly administered class of 
anti-diarrhoea medication, given in 43/56 (21.8%) events. 
For the 141 events that did not receive treatment, the median duration of the event was 3 days 
(range 1 to 435; SD 91.6)). At the time of DCO1 124/141 (87.9%) events were reported as 
resolved, with 17/141 (12.1%) reported as ongoing. 
It should be noted there is a high level of variability in the treatment duration data, as shown by the wide 
range and high SDs. Duration of individual events by maximum CTCAE grade are also based on a very small 
number of events that are grade >1, making it difficult to draw conclusions by severity. The majority of 
events did not require treatment and resolved quickly (141 events received no treatment, median duration 
of these events: 3 days, 124/141 resolved). Further reassurance is provided by the non-serious nature of 
diarrhoea events and the lack of any real association with clinical sequaelae.  
In conclusion, at a population level diarrhoea events associated with osimertinib treatment have limited 
clinical impact on patients. Duration of events tend to be low, particularly relative to the duration of 
exposure to osimertinib, and there is no evidence to suggest that that higher grade events persist for longer 
periods than lower grade events. 
Assessment of the applicant response: 
Updated overall data on diarrhoea shows similar results to that previously observed 41.5% of the patients on 
osimertinib treatment experienced this AE ( vs. 11% in the control arm). 34,4% (n=96) of the events were 
grade 1, 5.0% (n=14) grade 2 and 1.1% grade 3 (n=3) with no grade 4 ≥ reported.  
The duration of these events was highly variable, the median duration of grade 1 diarrhoea was 35 days 
whereas it was shorter for  for grade 2 events (5.5 days) and for the 3 grade 3 events reported (3 events of 
3,4 and 19 days).

In spite of the fact that most of the AEs of diarrhoea were of mild or moderate severity, the hifg frequency 
observed toguether with the duration of the events makes necessary the inclusion of a warning  under 
section 4.4. of SmPC.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
In present day healthcare programmes, procedures requiring sedation are common. Routine screening 
and  diagnostic  procedures  are  especially  frequent  in  adults,  together  with  therapeutic  healthcare 
technologies. Many of these require sedation to decrease anxiety and discomfort, with or without strong 
analgesia.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
In EU, according to available data, colonoscopies and bronchoscopies are listed among the top 10 surgical 
operations and procedures in the EU.  Immediately after cataract surgery, the second most common type 
of surgical operations and procedures is colonoscopy with or without a biopsy (ICD-9-CM codes 
45.22–45.25, 45.42 and 45.43). Bronchoscopies are also within the top 10. 
Among the most frequently performed procedures requiring sedation in adults are upper gastrointestinal 
(GI) endoscopies and colonoscopies. In the EU, colonoscopies were performed on between 0.2% to >1% 
of the population, depending upon the country (Eurostat 2018), and about two-thirds of the United States 
(US) population aged 50 to 75 years underwent a colorectal screening (Joseph 2010). It has been 
estimated that 40 million short diagnostic and therapeutic procedures requiring sedation are performed in 
the US annually (FDA 2012), and this number is likely to be higher in the EU where the population is 
larger. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
Procedural sedation is used in a wide range of medicinal endoscopic procedures, imaging techniques and 
small surgeries in order to sedate patients.  
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation 
Although upper GI endoscopy, colonoscopy and flexible bronchoscopy can be performed with and without 
sedation,  these  procedures  were  associated  with  improved  patient’s  tolerance,  e.g.  satisfaction  and 
willingness  to  repeat  the  examination,  when  sedation  is  administered.  However,  more  complex 
procedures  cannot  be  conducted  or  are  rarely  conducted  without  sedation  (Dumonceau  2010;  Khan 
2016). Without procedural sedation patients can suffer from pain, discomfort and anxiety, resulting in 
lack  of  cooperation  during  procedure,  with  potentially  more  difficult  or  prolonged  procedures  and 
decreased procedural success rates (Gross 2002; Early 2018). 
Importance of co-morbidities: any co-morbid condition could be present. Hence, an ideal sedative for 
procedural sedation should cause predictable and well-controllable levels of sedation, rapid onset and 
recovery with low risk of respiratory depression, of cardiovascular effects, or of other adverse reactions. 
Assessment report  
EMA/160756/2021  
Page 10/132 
 
 
 
 
2.1.5.  Management 
Currently,  either  propofol  or  a  benzodiazepine,  sometimes  in  combination  with  an  opioid  to  provide 
analgesia, is primarily used to obtain sedation for painful medical procedures of limited duration. Among 
the benzodiazepines, midazolam is the most commonly utilised agent. Propofol is an intravenous (i.v.) 
sedative/hypnotic agent with excellent sedative properties (Sacchetti 2007). A second advantage is its 
extremely  short  half-life  (Dunn  2007,  Frank  2006)  which  allows  rapid  recovery  from  sedation.  A 
disadvantage  of  propofol  or  of  fospropofol  (Garnock-Jones  2010,  Silvestri  2009),  its  pro  drug,  is  its 
potential  for  respiratory  depression  and  thus  hypoxia  (Miller  2005),  accordingly  requiring  constant 
monitoring  of  patient’s  vital  signs  and  respiration  rate.  Consequently,  a  second  physician  or  a  nurse 
capable  of  providing  general  anaesthesia  must  be  present  to  monitor  the  patient  while  the  primary 
physician  performs  the  procedure.  In  addition,  propofol  has  a  rather  narrow  therapeutic  index  which 
raises  concerns  with  regards  to  involuntary  overdosing  or  small  increments  needed  to  cause  deeper 
sedation. 
Benzodiazepines are widely used sedative agents with a lower likelihood for respiratory depression than 
propofol, thus these drugs require staff trained in resuscitation but not necessarily in providing general 
anaesthesia.  Their  main  disadvantage is  their long half-life,  e.g.  even  midazolam,  the  shortest  acting 
benzodiazepine has a half-life of approximately one to three hours (Bahn 2005). 
About the product 
Remimazolam  (also  referred  to  as  CNS7056  or  ONO-2745)  is  a  new  benzodiazepine  that  is  being 
developed  as  an  ultra-short-acting  intravenous  (i.v.)  agent  for  use  in  procedural  sedation  (e.g.,  for 
colonoscopies or bronchoscopies).

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of remimazolam besylate is methyl 
3-[(4S)-8-bromo-1-methyl-6-pyridin-2-yl-4H-imidazo[1,2-a][1,4]benzodiazepin-4-yl] propanoate 
benzenesulfonic acid or 4H imidazo[1,2-a][1,4]benzodiazepine-4-propanoic acid, 
8-bromo-1-methyl-6-(2-pyridinyl)-(4S)-methyl ester, benzenesulfonate (1:1), corresponding to the 
molecular formula C27H25BrN4O5S. It has a molecular weight of 597.48 g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 1: Active substance structure 
The active substance is an off-white to pale-yellow solid powder which is slightly hygroscopic, practically 
insoluble or very slightly soluble in aqueous media with pH ≥5.0 and sparingly soluble at acidic pH values. 
The chemical structure of remimazolam besylate was elucidated by a combination of mass spectrometry, 
elemental analysis, infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H and 13NMR), 
X-ray powder and single crystal X-ray crystallography. 
The solid-state properties of the active substance were measured by polarised light microscopy, 
differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) including melting point, infrared spectroscopy, Fourier 
transform-Raman spectroscopy and X-ray powder diffraction for determination of solid state forms (by 
using a proprietary screening technology), determination of the solubility profile, determination of 
hygroscopicity (by Dynamic Vapor Sorption), and pH. 
Remimazolam exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of one chiral centre. The chiral centre is 
derived from one of the starting materials. Inversion of the stereogenic centre is not plausible in the 
proposed synthetic process and the active substance is consistently synthesised as the S-enantiomer (an 
additional chiral centre is introduced during the course of the synthesis from another starting material but 
is not maintained in the active substance). The enantiomeric purity of the active substance is controlled 
routinely by chiral HPLC in the specifications. 
Remimazolam besylate exhibits polymorphism and two polymorphic forms have been identified. The final 
crystallisation step of the active substance synthesis process is designed to consistently deliver the 
thermodynamically most stable polymorph. 
Remimazolam besylate is sensitive to hydrolysis. To a lesser extent the active substance is sensitive to 
oxidation and light.

Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Remimazolam besylate is manufactured by one manufacturing site, with a number of other sites involved 
in testing of the active substance. 
Remimazolam besylate is synthesised in three main steps using well defined starting materials with 
acceptable specifications.  
Routine reprocessing is not undertaken for the manufacture of remimazolam besylate and reprocessing of 
intermediates  or  the  final  active  substance  will  only  be  performed  in  accordance  with  the  principles 
outlined in ICH Q7. No aseptic or sterilisation process is performed in the manufacture of remimazolam 
besylate. 
The starting materials have been defined in accordance with the scientific advice received from EMA. The 
applicant has committed to provide additional confirmation of capability of analytical methods to control 
impurities in starting materials.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. The applicant has 
committed to provide additional confirmation of the capability of analytical methods to control impurities 
in intermediates.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were discussed with regards to their 
origin and characterised.  
Following  the  initial  assessment,  the  CHMP  considered  as  Major  Objection  (MO)  that  the  approach  in 
respect  to  the  evaluation  and  control  of  potential  genotoxic/mutagenic  impurities  provided  was 
insufficient.  During  the  procedure,  this  was  adequately  addressed  by  the  applicant  and  potential  and 
actual  impurities  are  now  well  discussed  with  regards  to  their  origin  and  characterised.  A  risk-based 
assessment together with a control strategy has been provided for each potential genotoxic impurity. The 
control of potential impurities is adequately addressed in line with ICH Q3C. 
Changes made to the manufacturing process of the active substance used in non-clinical and clinical 
studies as well as for registration stability batches and validation batches on production scale have been 
provided in sufficient detail and have been justified. The quality of the active substance used in the 
various phases of the development is considered comparable with that produced by the proposed 
commercial process. 
The active substance is packaged in double bags, which comply with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and 
Commission Regulation (EU) 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identity (IR, XRPD), achiral assay 
(HPLC), assay (titration, chiral purity (HPLC), related substances (HPLC, GC-MS), water content (KF), 
residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), completeness of solution, residual solvents (GC), microbiological purity (Ph. 
Eur.), and bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.). 
Several process-related impurities have been listed as specified impurities in the active substance 
specification. The specification limits for those impurities that are above the qualification threshold of ICH 
Q3A have been qualified through toxicological studies. The toxicological qualification, assessed in the 
non-clinical AR, is considered acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/160756/2021  
Page 13/132 
 
 
 
Genotoxic impurities have been evaluated using a combination of a purge factor approach, in-silico 
toxicity predictions and in vitro and in vivo assessments. A TTC-based acceptable intake was determined 
for each potential genotoxic impurity. Potential genotoxic impurities were classified according to ICH M7. 
Predicted levels of potential genotoxic impurities in the active substance are >100 times lower than the 
TTC. 
An overall risk assessment on elemental impurities contamination in the active substance from the raw 
materials and the process equipment used in the manufacturing of remimazolam besylate was conducted 
in line with ICH Q3D. Class 1 and 2A elemental impurities as well as selected class 3 elements have been 
considered. Results for all elements in several validation batches were below the 30% ICH limit and hence 
no further control of elemental impurities in the active substance is required. 
The solvents used in steps 2 and 3 of the remimazolam besylate synthesis are controlled in the active 
substance specification. The solvents used in Step 1 are controlled at the level of the isolated 
intermediate, except for one solvent which was not detected in a number of batches and therefore not 
included in the intermediate specification. The specification limits are in line with ICH Q3C requirements 
and supported by data from several validation batches. 
A risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities was provided, which concluded that 
no  risk of  the  presence of  nitrosamines  was  identified  for  remimazolam  besylate  active  substance, or 
finished product. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is described as a sterile, white to off-white lyophilised powder, reconstituted before 
use with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection. The vial delivers a final concentration of 
2.5 mg/mL of remimazolam. 
The active substance remimazolam besylate is an ultra-short-acting benzodiazepine indicated for 
procedural sedation and therefore the aim was to develop a formulation as a solution for IV administration 
which enables modulation of dosage. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is 
included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The choice of the sterilisation method is adequately justified and in line with the Guideline on the 
sterilisation of the medicinal product, active substance, excipient and primary container. 
Sufficient data was provided on process development. The differences between the different stages of the 
manufacturing process from lab scale to validation/commercial scale are described in sufficient detail to 
understand the changes introduced throughout clinical development.  
Three validation batches of finished product were manufactured at commercial scale using active 
substance batches manufactured according to the commercial process. 
Studies were conducted to determine the process holding time and temperature.  
The studies used to investigate the compatibility between the active substance and the excipients 
selected for the formulation of the finished product were acceptable. The compatibility and stability 
studies conducted after reconstitution with NaCl 0.9% were acceptable. 
The control of microbial limits at drug product release and stability is acceptable. 
The formulation used during pivotal clinical studies is the same as that intended for marketing.  
The selection of the container closure system was satisfactorily justified and based on data from stability 
studies data as well as data from extractables/leachables studies. 
The primary packaging is a type 1 glass vial with a stopper (bromobutyl rubber) and seal (aluminium) 
with a blue polypropylene flip-off cap. The material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The 
choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the 
intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of several main steps and the process is considered a non-standard 
manufacturing process.  
The manufacturing process has been validated on three commercial scale batches of finished product. It 
has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of 
intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of 
manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. The identified critical steps are considered acceptable.

specification. 
Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been 
presented. 
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from several batches of finished product stored for up to 48 months under long term 
stability conditions of 25ºC/60% RH and 6 months under accelerated stability conditions of 40ºC/75% RH 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are representative of 
those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. 
The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. No significant changes were observed. 
Photostability studies were conducted according to ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug 
Substances and Products.  
The stability of the reconstituted product (after addition of 8.2 mL of 0.9% NaCl) was tested up to 24 
hours and the results presented. Reconstituted vials were stored at 25°C/60% RH in inverted and upright 
position. Based on the available data the claimed holding time of 24 hours under controlled room

temperature at 20ºC to 25ºC after reconstitution is agreed. However, the reconstituted product should be 
directly administered, and the following text is included in section 6.3 of the SmPC: 
In-use stability after reconstitution 
Chemical and physical in use stability has been demonstrated for 24 hours under controlled room 
temperature at 20°C to 25°C. 
From a microbiological point of view the solutions should be used immediately. If not used immediately, 
in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer 
than 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C, unless reconstitution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic 
conditions. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) 
is acceptable. Except from the protection from light, the medicinal product does not require any other 
special storage recommendations. 
Adventitious agents 
The only material of animal origin is lactose monohydrate which is of bovine origin. Lactose monohydrate 
is derived from bovine milk in compliance with the EU guideline (EMEA/410/01) and with the 
requirements of the current European Pharmacopoeia. Lactose monohydrate is certified free from the risk 
of TSE/BSE. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
The CHMP initially raised one major objection in relation to the active substance and one major objection 
in relation to the finished product. The first major objection concerned the approach in respect to the 
evaluation and control of potential genotoxic/mutagenic impurities in the active substance, which was 
considered insufficient. This major objection was adequately addressed by the applicant. The second 
major objection concerned the need to provide a risk assessment concerning the presence of nitrosamine 
impurities in the finished product. The major objection was addressed in a satisfactory way by the 
applicant. 
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no 
impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product. These points are put forward and agreed as 
recommendations for future quality development (please see below). 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented 
to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety.

2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation, which should be implemented within agreed 
timelines: 
1.  Applicant to confirm that several potential impurities can be controlled as unspecified impurities 
by the appropriate analytical method applied for control of the starting material. 
2.  Applicant to confirm that several potential impurities, can be controlled as unspecified impurities 
by the appropriate analytical method applied for control of the starting material. 
3.  Applicant to confirm that one impurity can be controlled as unspecified impurity by the 
appropriate analytical method applied for control of one intermediate. 
4.  Applicant to confirm that the two impurities can be controlled as unspecified impurities by the 
appropriate analytical method applied for control of one intermediate. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The applicant has submitted a full battery of non-clinical studies in support of this application.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Remimazolam is a short-acting intravenous benzodiazepine sedative/anesthetic. It acts as an agonist on 
the benzodiazepine site of the GABA-A receptor. In the human body, remimazolam is rapidly metabolised 
to an inactive metabolite by tissue esterase and is not metabolised by cytochrome-dependent hepatic 
pathways. GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. Pharmacology 
studies  were  performed  in  rodents,  micropigs,  sheep  and  monkeys.  Remimazolam  showed  sedative 
activity in all animal species studied, with a rapid onset and a short duration of sedation.  
Receptor  binding  and  specificity  of  remimazolam  was  characterised  in  vitro.  High  binding  affinity  of 
remimazolam for the benzodiazepine site of the GABAA receptor was found and it was exceeding that of 
its metabolite, CNS7054 by more than 300 times in brain tissue of human, pig and rat. 
A substantial number of in vivo studies in rodents, micropigs, sheep, and Cynomolgus monkeys were 
performed in order to assess pharmacological properties of remimazolam, to measure possible effects on 
respiratory  and  cardiovascular  systems  and  to  identify  possible  pharmacodynamics  interactions  with 
drugs relevant in the clinical setting aspired for remimazolam.  
Intravenous  injection of  20-30  mg/kg  remimazolam  caused  a  loss  of  righting reflex  in  mice  and  rats. 
Neither the principal metabolite, CNS7054, nor the R-enantiomer of remimazolam induced LRR at doses 
up to 100 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg, respectively.  
Assessment report  
EMA/160756/2021  
Page 18/132 
 
 
 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The  amnestic  effect  of  remimazolam  in  comparison  with  that  of  propofol  was  investigated  in  a 
step-through passive avoidance apparatus in rats (n = 10/group), where the latency to enter the dark 
compartment  was  used  as  the  index  of  evaluation.  The  latency  was  shortened  in  a  dose-dependent 
manner  by  remimazolam  and  propofol;  significant  differences  were  recognised  with  doses  from  0.5 
mg/kg remimazolam and from 2 mg/kg propofol. 
An additional radioligand study (presented in primary PD) extended these results to 24 different abuse 
relevant  receptors,  ion  channels  and  transporters  including  the  GABAA1  receptor.  No  significant 
responses  (>50%  binding  at  10  μM)  were  observed  in  any  primary  assay  except  for  the  α1,  β2,  γ2 
GABA-A receptor (62.1 % binding at 10 μM remimazolam). 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Safety pharmacology endpoints were evaluated in rats, rabbits and minipigs, and in young adult (2- to 
4-year old) cynomolgus monkeys. Also, two in vitro experiments were done: one to explore the effect on 
hERG-current in cell culture, second to explore the effect of remimazolam on the action potential of 
isolated guinea pig papillary muscle. 
In studies on guinea-pig papillary muscle, remimazolam at concentrations of 10 and 30 μM produced no 
significant changes compared with the vehicle control group. At 100 and 300 μM, the 30% and 50% action 
potential duration (APD30 and APD50) were decreased. In addition, an increase in the resting membrane 
potential and a prolongation of the 90% action potential duration (APD90) were observed at 300 μM. 
From these experiments it was concluded that remimazolam inhibited calcium channels at 100 μM or 
higher and the inwardly and delayed rectifying potassium channels at 300 μM. Regarding the myocardial 
action potential, a no-effect concentration of 30 μM was identified for remimazolam.  
No abnormal changes were observed in the ECG during or for 60 minutes after infusion of remimazolam 
(12-100  μg/kg/min  for  15  min)  in  miniature-pigs.  Following  infusion  of  remimazolam  over  6  h  in  the 
monkey study, slight QT prolongations compared to pre-dosing values were identified at 18, 30, and 60 
mg/kg (7.6, 8.2, and 10.0%, respectively) at 1 hour or 3 hours after the start of dosing. After the end of 
dosing, increases by 4.4 to 6.0 % compared to pre-dosing values were observed at 60 mg/kg. Lower 
remimazolam exposure levels failed to affect QTc and body temperature in Cynomolgus monkeys. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
In rats, the sedative effect of remimazolam was synergistically enhanced by fentanyl and remifentanil, as 
well as by sedative agents acting at sites other than the benzodiazepine site of the GABAA receptor 
(propofol, dexmedetomidine, thiamylal, and hydroxyzine). There was no such synergism with agents with 
the same mechanism of action (midazolam) or with atropine. The effective sedative dose of remimazolam 
decreased by 93% when administered with ketamine. Similar results were obtained with sevoflurane. 
Likewise, co-administration with remifentanil led to a reduction of the sedative dose of remimazolam by 
92% in monkeys. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  oral  bioavailability  of  remimazolam  was  studied  in  female  New  Zealand  White  rabbits  and  nasal 
bioavailablilty  in  rats  and  minipigs.  A  poor  bioavailability  (< 10%)  was  observed  for  both  alternative 
routes of administration. Remimazolam has a low oral, intranasal and intraperitoneal bioavailability in 
animal species tested. This is of no relevance as i.v. administration is the intended route of drug delivery. 
Assessment report  
EMA/160756/2021

Specific studies conducted with 14C-remimazolam showed minimal accumulation in any tissues. Plasma 
protein binding of remimazolam ranged from 70.1% to 71.0%, 76.0% to 77.2% and 91.6% to 92.1%, in 
rat, monkey and human serum, respectively, and from 85.5% to 86.5%, 75.9% to 78.7% and 88.6% to 
90.1% in rabbit, miniature pig and human plasma, respectively.  
Uptake of remimazolam by human hepatocytes was not saturated up to 1000 μg/mL and can therefore be 
considered to be mainly by passive diffusion. 
In  in  vitro  protein  binding  drug  interaction  studies  with  the  possible  concomitant  drugs  propofol, 
isoflurane,  sevoflurane,  thiamylal,  remifentanil,  rocuronium,  and  succinylcholine  performed  by 
ultrafiltration  method  at  their  respective  maximum  concentrations  in  clinical  practice    drug-drug 
interaction via displacement of protein binding by concomitant drugs in clinical practice were found to be 
negligible. 
The protein binding of 14C-CNS7054 over the concentration range of 0.5-50 µg/mL to rat, monkey and 
human  serum  protein  was  75.4%,  86.5%  and  91.9%,  respectively.  Protein  binding  of  CNS7054 
determined by rapid equilibrium dialysis ranged from 80% to 87%, 49% to 50% and 79% to 87% in 
rabbit, minipig and human plasma, respectively. 
Placenta  penetration  of  remimazolam  and/or  its  derivatives  was  very  limited  and  did  not  lead  to  a 
sustained exposure of the fetus. Remimazolam and/or its derivatives easily accessed breast milk; the 
concentrations determined in milk were linked to maternal plasma concentrations. 
The main route of metabolism of remimazolam is via tissue carboxylesterases (CES, primarily type 1A) to 
generate CNS7054, followed by hydroxylation and glucuronidation. Conversion to the main metabolite 
CNS7054  is  mediated  by  carboxylesterases  type  1A.  Cytochrome  P450  enzymes  do  not  meaningfully 
contribute to the elimination of remimazolam indicating low susceptibility to cytochrome P450-mediated 
drug-drug interactions. 
Studies with radiolabelled drug showed that the main route of excretion is fecal via bile in rats and urinary 
via the kidney in monkeys. Terminal half-life is short, indicating fast metabolism and elimination. This 
leads to fast recovery from sedation after the end of infusion. 
Remimazolam and CNS7054 caused no relevant inhibition of cytochrome P450 iso-enzymes 1A2, 2B6, 
2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4. There were no inducing effects on CYP1A2, 2B6, and 3A4. Remimazolam 
was  not  a  relevant  substrate  of  OATP1B1,  OATP1B3,  BCRP,  and  MDR1.  CNS7054  was  found  to  be  a 
substrate of MDR1 and BCRP, but not of MRP2-4. Both, remimazolam and CNS7054, caused no or no 
relevant  inhibition  of  a  panel  of  human  drug  transporters  (OAT1,  OAT3,  OATP1B1,  OATP1B3,  OCT2, 
MATE1,  MATE2-K,  BCRP,  BSEP,  and  MDR1)  These  results  together  show  a  very  low  potential  of 
remimazolam for interactions, neither as a victim nor as a perpetrator. 
Remifentanil did not influence the hydrolysis of remimazolam by human liver S9 fractions, dismissing the 
possibility of an interaction by competition for liver carboxylesterases.  
The characteristics of the concentration-dependent inhibition of trandolaprilate and CNS7054 formation 
were similar for each of the tested inhibitors (diltiazem, atorvastatin, benzil and ethyl paraoxon).  
Diltiazem appeared to be a more potent inhibitor than atorvastatin. Utilizing the FDA Draft Guidance In 
vitro metabolism- and transporter-mediated drug-drug interaction studies (2017) basic model, the risk of 
clinically relevant drug-drug interaction due to inhibition of CES1-mediated metabolism of remimazolam 
by atorvastatin and diltiazem was considered negligible. However, as these results do not reassure the 
lack of clinical significant pharmacokinetic interactions with therapeutic drugs known to be potent hCES1 
inhibitors, the applicant has developed and performed a new pharmacokinetic interaction study, as 
requested, which  confirmed that the influence on the exposure to remimazolam of other CES1 substrates 
by interaction with or competition for CES1 is negligible.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
All  pivotal  toxicity  studies  on  remimazolam  have  been  conducted  in  compliance  with  international 
GLP-standards  and  followed  currently  accepted  study  designs.  The  investigations  were  performed  in 
accordance with study protocols and laboratory standard operating procedures and met the requirements 
of ICH guidelines.  
Single  and/or  repeated  dose  toxicity  studies  have  been  conducted  in  rats,  mice,  minipigs,  and 
Cynomolgus monkeys, reproduction toxicity studies were performed in rats and rabbits, and the local 
tolerance was tested in rats, rabbits, pigs/minipigs, and monkeys.  
All pivotal non-clinical studies performed so far have used different formulations: 
1.  Early studies conducted by Paion used remimazolam drug substance dissolved in various solvents 
2.  Later studies conducted by Paion used the contemporary Paion drug product (containing lactose, 
later lactose/dextran dissolved in saline. 
In  pivotal  toxicity  studies,  different  batches  of  the  different  manufacturers  were  used  with  impurity 
profiles comparable to that of the intended marketed product.  
Single dose toxicity 
Single dose toxicity studies have been conducted in rodents and Cynomolgus monkeys. Remimazolam 
has been administered by intravenous bolus and intravenous infusion in studies conducted in CD-1 mouse 
and Cynomolgus monkey, respectively. Moreover, single dose toxicity studies with oral administration of 
remimazolam have been conducted in SD rat and NZW rabbits. 
In a dose-range finding phase, 125 mg/kg was identified as the maximum tolerated dose, which was 
administered as a single dose to male and female CD-1 mice, followed by a 14-day observation period. 
Clinical signs observed were considered to be associated with the sedative action of remimazolam. Body 
weight gain was reduced, but recovery was evident during the second week of the observation period. 
Food consumption was slightly reduced, with evidence of recovery towards the end of the observation 
period. No abnormal findings were recorded at necropsy. 
A single dose of remimazolam was administered intravenously by continuous infusion over 6 hours to 
male Cynomolgus monkeys at dose levels of 6, 18, 60, and 150 mg/kg. Clinical signs consistent with the 
sedative properties  of  remimazolam  (ataxic  gait,  incomplete eyelid  opening,  decrease  in  spontaneous 
activity, sitting position) were observed dose dependently in all groups. Additional symptoms at doses of 
60 and 150 mg/kg were somnolence, lateral position and coma. In the high dose group, single symptoms 
were observed up to 9 hours after the end of the infusion. No abnormalities were observed on day 2 after 
dosing. 
In histopathology, thickening of the intima, fibrosis and inflammation of the vascular wall, brown pigment 
in  the  vascular  wall,  and  thrombus  formation  were  observed  at  the  injection  site  in  dosed  groups; 
however, there was no clear dependence on dose level or drug concentration.  
These changes had been observed in a study using catheterisation. Thrombus was more severe at the end 
of the catheter than at the proximal side (marked versus slight). Both the frequencies and degrees of 
inflammation of the vascular wall followed a similar pattern. Therefore, it was considered that no clear 
relationship to remimazolam was observed, but that these changes were due to damage to the intima 
related to the test article. 
In  a  further  single-infusion  study,  remimazolam  was  administered  as  a  24-hour  single  intravenous 
continuous dose to male and female Cynomolgus monkeys at dose levels of 30, 60, and 120 mg/kg. After 
Assessment report  
EMA/160756/2021

observation  for  14  days,  necropsy  and  histopathology  were  conducted.  Changes  in  general  condition 
consistent with the sedative effect of the test compound were seen at all dose levels. The symptoms 
recovered later than 2 hours after completion of injections. Body weight, food consumption, urinalysis, 
haematology, blood biochemistry, necropsy and organ weight revealed no toxicological changes due to 
remimazolam  administration.  No  substance  dependent  gross  lesions  were  detected.  Histopathology 
revealed mild intimal thickening at the injection site (post-cava) in animals of all groups including the 
control.  This  change  was  not  associated  with necrosis  of  the  vascular  wall,  vasculitis,  orhrombus  and 
there was no obvious difference from the changes related to the physical stimulus of the catheter also 
observed in the control group. Nonetheless, thickening of the vascular intima was observed in the 120 
mg/kg group at a high grade and frequency, so that an effect of the test article at the concentration used 
in this dose group (2.5 mg/mL, versus 1.25 mg/mL at the low dose level) could not be excluded. It was 
concluded that the NOAEL for local toxicity was 60 mg/kg/day (formulation concentration: 1.25 mg/mL), 
due to a possible aggravation of the local irritation reaction by the test item at the concentration of 2.5 
mg/mL (used at the dose of 120 mg/kg/day).  
Taking  into  consideration  the  lack  of  abnormalities  during  a  2-week  observation  period  after  single 
administration  at  higher  dose  levels,  in  the  previous  study,  remimazolam  (besylate  salt,  BS)  was 
administered once intravenously by continuous infusion for 4 hours to male cynomolgus monkeys at dose 
levels of 3.2, 4.0, 4.8, and 6.4 mg/kg (0.8, 1.0, 1.2, and 1.6 mg/mL, respectively). Gross pathology was 
conducted  on  the  day  following  dosing  and  histopathology  of  the  injection  sites  was  then  conducted 
without setting a 2-week observation period. 
In histopathology, deposition of fibrinoid material on the intimal surface, necrosis of the vascular intima, 
very slight inflammation of the vascular wall, and slight thrombus were observed at the injection site in 
the 4.8 mg/kg (1.2 mg/mL) group and above. Therefore, the proposed NOAEL for the local findings at the 
injection site was 4.0 mg/kg/day (1.0 mg/mL). 
In summary, no systemic toxicological changes were observed when remimazolam was administered to 
monkeys by intravenous continuous infusion (up to 24 hours). 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeat-dose toxicity studies with intravenous administration of remimazolam were conducted in rats, 
minipigs  and  cynomolgus  monkeys.  Moreover,  studies  with  intranasal  administration  of  remimazolam 
were conducted in rats. 
Subchronic toxicity studies in Sprague-Dawley rat 
Subchronic  toxicity  studies  have  been  conducted  in  CD  rats  with  administration  of  remimazolam  by 
intravenous bolus up to 4 weeks duration. Moreover, the potential toxicity of 7 impurities identified in and 
structurally  related  to  the  remimazolam  drug  substance  has  been  assessed  in  a  2-weeks  subchronic 
toxicity study by repeated intravenous infusion in CD Rats. 
The administration of remimazolam to rats at 10 to 30 mg/kg/day for 28 days resulted in clinical signs 
associated with the sedative nature of the compound. No other findings were observed during the in-life 
portion  of  the  study.  Terminal  investigations  revealed  foamy  macrophages  in  the  spleen  and  a  local 
irritant effect at the site of administration.  
Due to exacerbation of the incidence of splenic foamy macrophages at 20 mg/kg/day and above, a finding 
considered to be non-adverse as it was not considered to affect splenic function and was found to be 
recoverable following a 2 week recovery period, the no observable systemic effect level is considered to 
be 10 mg/kg/day of remimazolam when administered intravenously to rats for 28 days. Local effects at

local blood vessels) were more pronounced in animals treated with remimazolam, especially in the high 
dose group (versus control groups). At the end of the recovery period, the increase in blood vessel intimal 
proliferation was not completely recovered in the high dose group. Therefore, a local toxicity no adverse 
effect level could not be determined due to the injection site findings at all dose levels. 
Subchronic toxicity studies in Cynomolgus monkey  
Repeated dose toxicity studies, up to 4 weeks duration, have been conducted in cynomolgus monkeys 
with administration of remimazolam by intravenous bolus and by intravenous infusion. 
The repeat dose toxicity of remimazolam dosed by the intravenous route, as a bolus injection, at 5, 10 
and 20 mg/kg/day once daily for 4 weeks has been conducted, including a 2-week recovery period. 
No  signs  of  toxicological  significance  that  could  be  considered  attributable  to  treatment  with  the  test 
substance were noted during the course of this study. 
Signs commonly seen in both sexes at all dose levels included are considered to be directly related to the 
pharmacological (sedative) effect of the test substance. The findings observed with regards to the ECG 
data were considered to be due to the substantial decrease in heart rate in remimazolam treated animals. 
The prolongation of PR and RR observed were considered to be associated with decreased heart rate due 
to the sedated nature of the animals and not to be of toxicological relevance. 
The changes in the kidney were present in the vehicle control group but did show a slight increase in 
animals dosed at 10 mg/kg/day and above. The changes appeared to be reduced in severity after the 
2-week recovery period, but reversibility was not complete. The increase in liver cytoplasmic rarefaction 
noted in some treated females suggests a metabolic response in the liver related to glycogen storage. 
Changes at the injection site indicated irritation above that expected with an intravenous dosing, but this 
appeared to be related to the vehicle and showed no clear increase with the addition of the test substance. 
There  was  evidence  of  recovery,  but  the  changes  were  not  completely  reversible  after  the  2-week 
recovery period. 
Based on the results of this study, the NOEL would be considered to be 5 mg/kg/day of remimazolam 
when dosed intravenously to primates for 28 days. 
Potential local adverse effects at the injection sites were additionally investigated in a repeat dose study 
with intravenously administration of remimazolam by continuous infusion for 4 days. Midazolam was the 
comparative control article. The proximal side at the injection sites as been evaluated following single and 
4-day repeated dosing. The degrees of change at the remimazolam 6.4 mg/kg injection sites were similar 
to those at the midazolam 2.16 mg/kg injection sites. No effects on the remimazolam (1.6 or 3.2 mg/kg) 
injection sites were noted with single dosing or 4-day repeated dosing. 
Subchronic toxicity studies have been conducted with longer infusion periods (up to 12h). 
In a repeated-dose toxicity remimazolam was infused at doses of 6.75, 9.0, 11.25 and 22.5 mg/kg over 
9 hours per day for two weeks. The clinical findings noted were mainly caused by sedative and anesthetic 
effects as drug efficacy. The changes at 6.75 and 9 mg/kg recovered by 2 hours after the end of dosing, 
while  findings  at  11.25  and  22.5  mg/kg  recovered  by  the  start  of  dosing  on  the  following  day.  Local 
adverse effects were not dose-dependent and were seen around the tip of the indwelling catheter. 
Moreover, a repeated-dose toxicity with continuous 12 h intravenous infusion of remimazolam at doses of 
12,  30,  and  60  mg/kg  for  a  treatment  period  of  four  weeks  has  also  been  conducted.  The  expected 
sedative  effects  due  to  pharmacological  activity  of  remimazolam  were  noted.  Gross  findings  and 
histopathological lesions at the injection sites were not dose related and showed the same frequencies 
and  degrees  in  the  test  article  groups  as  in  the  control  animals.  These  findings  were  considered  as 
reactive lesions due to physical irritation from the implanted catheter.

The  evaluation  of  toxicokinetics  parameters  in  repeat  dose  studies  with  intravenous  infusion  of 
remimazolam demonstrate that the mean Cmax and AUC0-24h of plasma remimazolam and the metabolite 
CNS7054 increased approximately dose proportionally. There were no effects of repeated injection and no 
sex differences. 
Subchronic toxicity studies in Goettingen minipigs 
Goettingen minipigs were considered an alternative non-rodent species for toxicological assessment of 
remimazolam. In the four-week intravenous infusion study conducted in minipigs, dose-related sedative 
effects were noted in all animals treated with remimazolam. Maximum sedative effects reached a plateau 
5 min after start of infusion, persisted after the end of infusion showing a dose-depentent duration. No 
signs of toxicity were observed. The NOAEL was established at the highest dose tested, 120 mg/kg, which 
also constituted the maximum feasible dose. Additionally, it was demonstrated that the technical infusion 
procedure resulted in local reactions not related to the test substance. 
Repeat dose toxicity studies using intranasal administration of remimazolam to rats 
The  local  tolerability  of  intranasal  delivery,  the  pharmacokinetics  and  bioavailability  after  intranasal 
administration, and the reversibility of any effects after a 14-day recovery, have been assessed in a four 
days  repeated  dose  toxicity  study  following  intranasal  administration  of  Remimazolam  to  male 
Sprague-Dawley  Rats.  Male  Sprague-Dawley  rats  were  treated  intranasally  with  1,  2  or  4  mg 
remimazolam/animal/day corresponding to 4, 8 or 16 mg/kg/day, or intravenously with 2 mg/kg/day 
over 4 days. Remimazolam administered via the intranasal route resulted in mild levels of sedation but 
was not as efficacious as the same dose administered intravenously. 
The  intranasal  administration  of  remimazolam  was  well  tolerated  in  the  rats,  animals  showed  good 
recovery after each dosing session. 
In summary, the intranasal administration of remimazolam did not lead to any signs of local or systemic 
toxicity.  The  low  bioavailability  after  intranasal  administration  is  demonstrated  by  the  results  of  the 
toxicokinetic data in line with the lack of clinical symptoms. 
Genotoxicity  
Remimazolam showed no mutagenic potential in the bacterial reverse mutation assay. 
In the mouse lymphoma assay, the frequency of gene mutations only increased in conjunction with high 
cytotoxicity (decrease of relative total growth to values around 20 % or less), regardless of treatment 
method.  The  mouse  lymphoma  assay  revealed  a  significant  increase  in  the  total  mutation  frequency 
(T-MF) in short-term treatment with S9 mix, but no concentration-dependent increase was noted in both 
the initial and the confirmatory assays. In the same study, a significant concentration-dependent increase 
in the TMF in short-term treatment without S9 mix was noted. Concentration-dependency, however, was 
observed only in the initial experiment, not in the confirmatory study. Significant increases in the TMF in 
24hour continuous treatment (without S9 mix) were noted in both assays. Concentration-dependency 
was lacking. 
Coinciding, 
the 
relative  cell  survival  and 
the 
relative  suspension  growth  showed  a 
concentration-dependent  decrease.  As  cytotoxicity  of  remimazolam  showed  a  strong  correlation  with 
T-MF  (r=0.883),  the  increase  in  T-MF  was  considered  a  nonspecific  effect  caused  by  cytotoxicity. 
Remimazolam did not induce micronuclei in the rat. In the comet assay, there was no increase of %Tail 
DNA up to the maximum dose. Thus, remimazolam showed neither evidence of micronucleus-inducing 
potential nor of inducing DNA damage in vivo.  
In light of the above, remimazolam was considered to have no genotoxic properties.

Carcinogenicity 
Remimazolam  was  not  investigated  in  a  carcinogenicity  study.  As  the  chemical  structure  of  the  test 
compound does not show evidence of a structure-activity relationship suggesting carcinogenic risk or any 
relationship to known carcinogens, and as there is no indication of genotoxicity, cytotoxicity, or effects 
enhancing tissue proliferation in repeat dose toxicity studies, and remimazolam and principal metabolite 
are  not  retained  in  tissue  for  longer,  there  is  no  cause  of  concern  justifying  the  need  of  specific 
carcinogenicity studies. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Remimazolam  has  been  assessed  in  a  complete  reproductive  and  developmental  toxicological 
programme. 
The  potential  safety  concerns  of  remimazolam  on  fertility  and  early  embryonic  development  to 
implantation were examined in a Segment I study in Sprague Dawley rats following i.v. administration to 
F0 generation animals. A slight but statistically significant increase in pre-implantation loss was observed 
in  low  and  high  dose  females.  However,  values  for  pre-implantation  loss  were  within  or  below  the 
laboratory´s historical background values, and this finding was not considered of toxicological relevance. 
In addition, a slight reduction of sperm motility was noted in the high dosed males. However, the NOEL 
established  for  male  and  female  fertility  correspond  to  the  highest  dose  tested,  30  mg/kg/day. 
Furthermore, no adverse effects have been identified on male fertility parameters assessed in rabbits 
within the scope of the extended fertility/mating study, and in minipigs following daily exposure over 4 
weeks in the context of a subchronic repeat dose toxicity study. 
The influence of remimazolam on embryo-fetal development was investigated in female Sprague Dawley 
rats at dose levels of 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg/day remimazolam, from the 6th to the 17th day of pregnancy. 
Intravenous  treatment  with  remimazolam  caused  the  expected  dose-dependent  pharmacodynamic 
effects (starting at the lower dose level 3 mg/kg/d). No remimazolam-related increase was noted in the 
incidence  of  malformations,  variations,  or  retardations  at  any  dose  level  tested,  not  even  at 
materno-toxic dose levels. Thus, the NOEL for the dams was below 3 mg remimazolam/kg bw/day. The 
NOEL for the fetal organism was above 30 mg remimazolam/kg/day. 
In addition, potential effects on embryo-fetal development were also investigated in female Himalayan 
rabbits  at  dose  levels  of  1.25,  2.5  and  5.0  mg/kg/day  remimazolam,  from  the  6th  to  the  20th  day  of 
pregnancy.  Intravenous  treatment  with  remimazolam  caused  the  expected  dose-dependent 
pharmacodynamic effects (starting at the lower dose level 1.25 mg/kg/d).The prenatal fetal development 
was not affected with respect to the number of corpora lutea, implantation sites, resorptions, number of 
live  fetuses,  the  values  calculated  for  the  pre-  and  post-implantation  loss  and  the  sex  distribution  of 
fetuses. The fetal and placental weights were slightly reduced in the high dose group. The NOEL was 
below 1.25 mg/kg/day remimazolam for the dams and 2.5 mg/kg/day remimazolam for the fetuses. 
Furthermore, an extended fertility/mating study has been conducted in New Zealand White rabbits, using 
a  loading  iv-bolus  dose  followed  by  iv-infusion  in  order  to  mimic  the  clinical  setting  of  induction  and 
maintenance  of  anaesthesia.  No  safety  concerns  have  been  identified  in  fertility,  embryo-fetal 
development, and postnatal development following birth up to day 35 post-partum, after exposure of the 
female from prior to mating until weaning. Therefore, the NOAELs proposed for the different phases of the 
study correspond to the highest dose level at which the endpoints were tested: i) mating performance and 
fertility: 30 mg/kg/day; ii) maintenance of pregnancy, development of the conceptus and parturition: 20 
mg/kg/day; iii) maternal maintenance of litter during lactation, kit survival, development and growth: 20 
mg/kg/day; and iv) kit behaviour, (all behaviour except that assessed by the tactile test): 20 mg/kg/day.

The  effects  of  remimazolam  on  pre-  and  postnatal  development,  including  maternal  function  and  the 
development of F1 and F2 offspring, were investigated in rats by intravenous administration at doses of 
3, 10 and 30 mg/kg/day. The treatment period was from day 6 of gestation to day 20 of lactation. The 
dams  were  observed  for  delivery  and  nursing  behaviour  and  necropsied  on  day  21  of  lactation.  F1 
offspring were observed for physical development, reflexes, behaviour and sexual maturity and mated at 
10-12 weeks of age to evaluate their fertility and development of F2 generation. No safety concerns have 
been identified in dams, including maternal function, when treated from day 6 of gestation to day 20 of 
lactation. Moreover, no toxicological effects of remimazolam on pre- and postnatal development of F1 and 
F2 offsprings were noted. Therefore, the highest dose tested, 30 mg/kg/day, was considered to be the 
NOAEL of remimazolam for general toxicity and for reproductive function of dams. The same dose of 30 
mg/kg/day was considered to be the NOAEL for development of the subsequent generation (F1). 
Local Tolerance  
Remimazolam has been found to aggravate lesions in response to local injury at the administration site of 
intravenous infusion. Such vulnerability was found to depend on whether a drug is administered as a 
continuous infusion or an intravenous bolus, on drug concentration, and on vessel calibre. In summary, 
the following conclusions and recommendations can be made based on analysis of the available data: 
i.v continuous infusion:  
•  Regardless of vessel size, remimazolam can be safely administered at a final concentration of 1 
mg/ml entering the blood vessel.  
•  Vessels  of  a  larger  diameter  ( ≥   1.5  mm)  allow  safe  administration  of  remimazolam  at 
concentrations of up to 2.0 mg/mL.  
•  Co-infusion  of  saline  at  a  rate  of  1  mL/kg/h,  which  is  standard  medical  practice,  with 
remimazolam  reconstituted  to  2  mg/mL  and  infused  at  1  -  2  mg/kg/h  as  recommended  for 
general  anaesthesia,  results  in  local  concentrations  falling  short  of  those  associated  with 
thrombophlebitic lesions even when small veins are used. As the susceptibility to such lesions is 
governed by the vessel size, the use of veins of larger calibres (forearm or central) adds a further 
layer of safety.   
• 
In  summary,  a  2  mg/mL  remimazolam  reconstituted  concentration  is  recommended  for 
continuous infusion provided that: 
o  a  parallel  infusion  of  saline  is  in  place,  diluting  the  concentration  of  remimazolam  to 
around 1 mg/mL. OR 
o  veins of a larger calibre are used.  
i.v bolus: 
• 
• 
It  can  be  predicted  that  volumes  administered  by  bolus  injection  in  vessels  typically  used  in 
humans  will  almost  instantaneously  be  diluted  by  blood  flow,  resulting  in  tolerable  local 
concentrations. Damage observed in rat tails in a physical dependence study can be explained by 
serial venipunctures of small veins of a particularly vulnerable organ and a drug concentration 
more than twice that used in human bolus studies – 6 mg/mL vs 2.5 mg/mL.  
In summary, remimazolam can be safely administered as an intravenous bolus at concentrations 
of up to 5 mg/mL.

Other toxicity  
There were no findings indicating an influence of remimazolam on the immune system. 
The  applicant  investigated  a  number  of  impurities  and  degradants  in  genotoxicity  studies  and  in  the 
4-weeks toxicity study in Cynomolgus monkeys. None of the studies revealed toxicological findings. As an 
exception,  an  impurity  induced  by  exposure  to  light  was  found  to  cause  lethality  in  rats.  However,  a 
quantitative  appraisal  shows  that  this  hazard  can  be  dismissed  at  the  specified  level  with  significant 
confidence.  
No metabolites of remimazolam unique to humans were found with regard to the animal species used in 
the toxicity studies. Therefore, specific toxicity studies with individual metabolites other than CNS7054 
have not been conducted, as the metabolites were adequately investigated within the context of studies 
on remimazolam. CNS7054 was found to be safe in a variety of safety and toxicity studies including a 
4-week toxicity study in Cynomolgus monkeys, in which a batch spiked with various impurities including 
CNS7054 was used.  
Based on studies in rats and monkeys, remimazolam was shown to share with other benzodiazepines the 
potential to induce self-administration and physical dependence. These results were expected given the 
known pharmacodynamics of remimazolam. 
The safety and tolerability of dextran as an excipient was assessed in a general toxicity study and a study 
on possible effects in rats with impaired kidney function. A series of toxicity studies in rabbits has been 
published  and  the  applicant  considered  them  in  their  assessment,  offering  supportive  evidence  in  a 
second  species.  The  28  days  subchronic  toxicity  study  in  rats  was  enhanced  by  histopathological 
investigation of the major organs of dextran-related changes (i.e. foamy/microvacuolated cells) to verify 
comparable systemic effects in animals of the main toxicity study and the repeat toxicokinetic study. A 
dedicated study in a rat cisplatin model of renal impairment showed that 7 days of repeated treatment 
with up to 2000 mg/kg of dextran 40 did neither exacerbate the degree of cisplatin-induced kidney injury 
nor did it influence the course of recovery from renal damage (). Thus, rat studies support the notion that 
dextran 40 at doses of up to 2 g/kg poses no risk of renal injury to healthy and renally impaired animals. 
This is in agreement with the rabbit studies. In rabbits, dextran was infused at dose levels of 2, 4, and 8 
g/kg, repeated daily for one month, three months, or six months. Results of these higher doses were 
consistent with those of the rat study presented above. 
According to the applicant, “as the intake of dextran 40, that is associated with using remimazolam at its 
recommended MDD, amounts to 4 g (80 mg/kg in a 50 kg person), this NOAEL constitutes a safety margin 
of  7.5  (600/80),  which  is  acceptable,  also  in  view  of  the  benign  changes  used  in  identification  of  the 
NOAEL. Of note, margins will increase with body weight.” 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An  ERA  was  submitted  by  the  applicant  in  accordance  with  the  Guideline  on  the  Environmental  Risk 
Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2*), 2006. 
The  distribution  coefficients  were  calculated  by  the  software  from  the  shift  in  the  pKa  measured  by 
potentiometric  method.  The  applicant  enclosed  study  report  to  confirm  that  pKa  and  Log  P/D 
measurements in the ERA report were experimentally determined. The octanol water partition coefficient 
at pH 7,4 (log D) was reported to be 2,52 and was ranging from 2,4 to 2,52 in the pH range of 5 to 9. All 
log D were below the limit of 4,5 so no further PBT assessment was conducted.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Remimazolam was designed to be a sedative/anaesthetic drug with a short duration of action due to its 
breakdown  by  carboxylesterases  to  an  inactive  metabolite  (CNS7054).  It  acts  as  an  agonist  on  the 
benzodiazepine site of the GABAA receptor but may offer more predictable action and quicker recovery 
than midazolam due to a faster systemic clearance.  
These  properties  of  remimazolam  were  confirmed  in  early  non-clinical  pharmacodynamic  and 
pharmacokinetic studies. These studies also showed that remimazolam is active in a number of different 
species with the exception of dogs where there was an excitatory rather than a sedative effect.  
In  monkey  safety  study  at  18  mg/kg  and  greater,  prolongation  of  QTc  was  observed.  In  addition, 
remimazolam  had  an  effect  on  intra-abdominal  temperature.  The  normal  temperature  range  in 
cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) is 98.6 to 103.1 °F (37.0 to 39.5°C). So the changes seen in 
this study are in the physiological fluctuation range (from cca 38 - cca 36.5°C) of the body temperature

of the monkey and cannot be connected to the QTc prolongation or remimazolam. A clear conclusion on 
the cause for this effect cannot be drawn.  
Regarding  higher  doses  which  showed  some  effects  on  cardiovascular  safety,  in  in  vitro  studies 
remimazolam  decreased  the  hERG  tail  current  in  a  concentration-dependent  manner.  However,  the 
estimated IC25 and IC50 values for remimazolam inhibition of hERG tail current were 62 and 207 μM, 
respectively, concentrations well above those required to activate GABAA receptors in vitro (0.36-1.38 
μM) or free plasma levels reached in clinical studies. 
In monkey safety study, prolongation of QTc was observed at dose 18 mg/kg and higher. According to PK 
data,  when  remimazolam  is  administered  as  single  i/v  dose  to  monkeys  at  a  dose  18  mg/kg,  Cmax 
reaches 1608.51 ng/ml. Protein Binding was determined to be 69-71% in rat, 76-79% in minipig and 
monkey, 86- 87% and 89-92% in human plasma. 
According  to  human  PK  data  (data  from  PK  AR),  Cmax  for  0.1  mg/kg;  equals  7  mg  for  a  standard 
bodyweight of 70 kg; administered in the multiple ascending dose study CNS7056-002 for the indication 
of procedural sedation, is 560 ng/ml. In the ascending-dose study in subjects undergoing colonoscopy 
(CNS7056-002), Cmax was 464 ng/mL and AUCinf 325 ng∙h/mL at the initial dose of 0.075 mg/kg (5.25 
mg for a 70 kg subject).  
From these presented data, a safety margin for cardiovascular effects can be set to approximately 2.8 to 
3.5 based on Cmax for remimazolam. 
The applicant did not provide a critical review of possible CNS relevant effects but provided a modest 
review  on  respiratory  effects.  Since  remimazolam  is  a  benzodiazepine,  the  target  pharmacodynamics 
organ/system  is  CNS.    Taking  into  account  overall  pharmacological  and  toxicological  profile,  it  is 
concluded that it shares class effects with other benzodiazepines when it comes to CNS safety. No further 
questions  were  raised  on  this  topic.  Respiratory  effects  are  discussed  by  the  applicant  and  a  similar 
conclusion  is  drawn.  Remimazolam  shares  with  other  benzodiazepines  some  potential  to  cause 
respiratory depression as a class effect.  
The  intended  route  of  administration  is  via  intravenous  bolus  or  continuous  infusion  in  humans. 
Nonclinical studies mirrored these modes of administration.  
Pharmacokinetics and toxicokinetics of remimazolam and its main metabolite, CNS7054, were studied in 
different species and for different administration pathways. Intravenous, a route intended for clinical use 
was investigated in rat, rabbit, miniature pig, sheep and monkey. In all animal species studied, following 
intravenous administration a short or very short initial phase half-life and high volume of distribution were 
observed,  indicative  of  extensive  tissue  distribution  and  fast  elimination.  Compartmental  analysis 
performed after bolus administration in miniature pigs, dogs and sheep, indicated a PK profile described 
by two or three compartments. After administration by infusion, the PK profile was characterised by early 
attainment of a steady state.  
Diltiazem appeared to be a more potent inhibitor than atorvastatin. Utilizing the FDA Draft Guidance In 
vitro metabolism- and transporter-mediated drug-drug interaction studies (2017) basic model, the risk of 
clinically relevant drug-drug interaction due to inhibition of CES1-mediated metabolism of remimazolam 
by atorvastatin and diltiazem was considered negligible. However, these results do not reassure the lack 
of clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions with therapeutic drugs known to be potent hCES1 
inhibitors.  A  new  pharmacokinetic  interaction  study  was  requested  with  a  panel  of  hCES1  inhibitors, 
including (but not limited to) simvastatin, troglitazone, fenofibrate, nitrendipine, telmisartan, nelfinavir 
and loperamide (Curr Med Chem. 2018;25(14):1627-1649). A study was performed and confirmed that 
the  influence  on  the  exposure  to  remimazolam  of  other  CES1  substrates  by  interaction  with  or 
competition for CES1 is negligible as had been generally concluded for CES1 substrates with CES1 as a 
point  of  interaction  in  the  review  by  Bohnert  et  al.,  2016.  (Bohnert  T,  Patel  A,  Templeton  I,  et  al;

Remimazolam  shows  a  pharmacokinetic  profile  characterised  by  a  short  half-life  caused  by  rapid 
conversion to CNS7054, especially in rodents. These pharmacokinetic properties are optimal for its use as 
intravenously administered anesthetic, as titration of the effect without sizable delays should be possible.  
The short half-life of remimazolam supports fast recovery from anaesthesia or sedation.  
The interaction potential of remimazolam is low.  
Depending on the administration route, and at least in one species, Cmax and/or AUC of remimazolam and 
its metabolite were equal or higher than those observed in humans. 
The acute toxicity of remimazolam was assessed in single dose intravenous (bolus) administration study 
in  mice  and  single  dose  intravenous  (infusion)  studies  in  cynomolgus  monkeys.  The  major  findings 
observed in rats and monkeys were sedative effects due to the pharmacological activity of remimazolam. 
A dose-dependent duration of sedative effects after the end of remimazolam infusion was noted. Aditional 
systemic adverse effects have not been identified. However, local adverse effects at the injection site 
have been noted in monkeys dosed by intavenous infusion and dedicated local tolerance studies have 
been conducted to address the potential local toxicity of remimazolam. 
In  addition,  studies  with  oral  administration  of  remimazolam  have  also  been  conducted.  No  safety 
concerns  have  been  identified  in  the  in  SD  rat  and  NZW  rabbits  orally  dosed  with  remimazolam.  As 
remimazolam  is  intended  for  intravenous  use  in  procedural  sedation,  studies  using  the  oral  route  of 
administration are less relevant to establish the safety profile of remimazolam. 
Vehicle is used in numerous nonclinical studies but is not continued to the final product for which this MA 
is sought. There is no explicit explanation in the nonclinical part of dossier why the formulation changed 
during  the  development  of  the  product.  Some  local  effects  and  effects  found  in  histopathological 
examination of rat kidneys are attributed to this vehicle. 
Most  findings  observed  in  toxicological  repeat-dose  studies  can  be  explained  by  exaggerated 
pharmacological action of the test compound. Singular histopathological findings and marginal changes of 
laboratory  parameters  observed  in  repeat-dose  studies,  which  were  reversible,  or  not  strictly 
dose-dependent, do not indicate specific toxicological issues.  
Remimazolam, at higher concentrations in the dosing solution, was found to be able to aggravate the 
inflammatory  reaction  at  the  injection  site,  which  is  known  to  be  associated  with  the  procedure  of 
intravenous administration. Where tested as a comparator, midazolam produced comparable effects. It is 
concluded that the primary lesions are due to a mechanical irritation of the vessel wall during the puncture 
procedure,  rather  than  a  specific  local  toxic  effect  of  the  test  compound.  General  toxicity  and  special 
studies indicate that the local irritating effect can be increased by higher concentrations of remimazolam 
[above 1.0-2.0 mg/mL (infusion); above 5-8 mg/mL (bolus)]. 
Toxicokinetic  findings  indicate  no  accumulation  of  drug  substance  and  dose-linearity.  Possible  gender 
differences are noted in minipig (infusion study) where a lower exposure is achieved in females compared 
to males but this finding has no significance for this MAA and toxicological evaluation since exposure in 
both sexes is still sufficient. Sufficiently high exposure is achieved in bolus administration in monkeys but 
not in rats. Similar exposure is achieved in bolus administration with 20 mg/kg in monkeys and in infusion 
study with 120 mg/kg in minipigs and 50 mg/kg in monkeys which is indicative of higher exposure with 
smaller  doses  but  faster  administration.  Combined  infusion  and  bolus  studies  can  be  regarded  as 
sufficient for exploration of toxicity of remimazolam.

Since TK data from rat studies, taken all together, are inconclusive, and PK/TK/reproductive toxicity data 
for rabbits are not adequate, assessor is of the opinion that this part of the non-clinical package should be 
treated as insufficient data. Combined with lack of exposed pregnancies in humans, labelling in the SmPC 
was  changed  to  option  4  described  in  EMEA/CHMP/203927/2005  Guideline  on  risk  assessment  of 
medicinal products on human reproduction and lactation: from data to labelling.  
Since  remimazolam  is  to  be  administered  during  procedures  performed  in  hospital  setting  and  under 
healthcare professional monitoring, there is no safety issue with dependence potential finding at this time 
point.  
The mutagenic potential of remimazolam was investigated in 3 Ames tests (one of which was a non-GLP 
assay), 2 mouse lymphoma assays, and 2 in vivo micronucleus assays in rat bone marrow cells. In studies 
(Ames test), (Mouse lymphoma assay), (Rat micronucleus test), (Rat micronucleus – comet combination 
assay),  a  remimazolam  batch  spiked  with  eight  synthetic  impurities/degradants  and  the  principal 
metabolite CNS7054 was used. Study yielded negative results, but in study it was concluded that there is 
a  possibility  of  chromosomal  aberrations.  The  applicant  provided  an  acceptable  explanation  for  the 
observed effect. The applicant provided an adequate elaboration on adequacy of rat as a species for in 
vivo genotoxicity studies since the choice of species was initially questioned due to specific PK properties. 
It is agreed that the presented clinical signs of pharmacological activity of remimazolam are indicative of 
tissue distribution, including bone marrow, sufficient for any genotoxic changes to develop. For the study, 
the applicant acknowledged that the impurity concentrations tested did not reach those recommended in 
the ICH S2 (R1) guideline and conducted a SAR analysis using a total of five different in silico systems. 
The common outcome was that none of the tested impurities raised alerts for Ames mutagenicity and 
hence all of them fall into class 5 (“treat as non-mutagenic impurity”) of the classification system enacted 
in the ICH M7(R1) Guideline.  
In  terms  of  assessment  of  reproductive  and  developmental  safety  of  psychotropic  agents  such  as 
remimazolam is limited by the achievement of sufficient over-exposures imposed by the pharmacological 
effects on behaviour and state of consciousness, leading to further secondary effects on food consumption 
and maternal care. Notwithstanding, no safety concerns have been identified in the three segments of 
reproductive and developmental set of studies conducted with remimazolam. 
Published  studies  in  animals  (including  primates)  at  doses  resulting in light to  moderate  anaesthesia, 
demonstrate that the use of anaesthetic agents during the period of rapid brain growth or synaptogenesis 
results in cell loss in the developing brain that can be associated with prolonged cognitive deficiencies. 
The  clinical  significance  of  these  nonclinical  findings  in  not  known.  A  programme  of  juvenile  toxicity 
studies  was  initiated  in  minipigs  with  remimazolam  to  address  this  concern  (see  EMA  decision 
P/0364/2019).  A  pilot  study  in  juvenile  minipigs  was  conducted  by  PAION  during  Feb-April  (2020). 
Results  of  this  study  indicated  that  juvenile  minipigs  do  not  represent  a  suitable  model  for 
neurotoxicological  experiments  with  remimazolam  due  to  insufficient  sedation/anaesthesia  level 
achieved. In summary, five piglets were treated either on PND14 (±1D) or PND28 (±1D) at dose rates 
indicated in the below Table 2. In none of the animals, a suitable state of sedation/anaesthesia could be 
induced. The animals still displayed movements (paddling behaviour) and other activity and reactions 
despite the infusion of remimazolam at per body weight dose rates up to 50-fold higher than typical for 
human sedation (1 mg/kg/h). The applicant had to conclude that the level and nature of effects noted in 
piglets on all study days indicate that the juvenile minipig is an inept model for testing possible risks of 
remimazolam when used for juvenile human sedation/anaesthesia. 
However,  the  study  is  not  conclusive  as  juvenile  minipigs  do  not  represent  a  suitable  model  for 
neurotoxicological assessment of remimazolam due to insufficient sedation/anaesthesia level achieved. 
Therefore, the applicant is planning to evaluate the neurotoxicity of remimazolam during the period of 
rapid  brain  development  by  prolonged  treatment  (over  several  hours)  of  juvenile  rats  (PND7)  under 
Assessment report

development to young adults. Potential cognitive deficiencies related to the use of remimazolam during 
the period of rapid brain development will be addressed using standardised methods such as the Morris 
Water Maze test and an open field test. 
As a result of the repeat-dose toxicity studies, the No Observed Effect Levels or No Observed Adverse 
Effect Levels given in the following table were established:

Cmax  values  in  Cynomolgus  monkeys  reached  the  corresponding  human  values  and  those  in  minipigs 
exceeded  them  up  to  4.8-fold  (at  NOAEL  levels)  considering  unbound  remimazolam  plasma 
concentrations.  The  corresponding  AUC-values  achieved  in  toxicity  studies  in  monkeys  were  up  to 
4.9-fold and in minipigs up to 15.1-fold higher than in humans.  
The main metabolite of remimazolam, CNS7054, showed no relevant pharmacological activity. Compared 
to remimazolam, its sedative potency was about 400-fold lower in vitro  (binding assays) and at least 
200-fold lower in vivo (studies in rats, mice and Cynomolgus monkeys). No concerns were identified in 
dedicated  safety  studies  including  cardiac  excitability,  drug  transporting  and  metabolizing  proteins, 
phototoxicity,  haemocompatibility,  and  preliminary  toxicity  studies  in  rats  and  Cynomolgus  monkeys 
(laboratory findings and general condition).  
Studies on the toxicity of dextran conducted in healthy and renally impaired rats indicated a safe use of 
the dextran-containing formulation at dextran exposures of at least 7.5 times that associated with the 
administration of remimazolam at its maximal TDI of 1 g. As presented by the applicant, the rat study 
data are consistent with published results of a series of dextran 40 toxicity studies performed in rabbits. 
The  applicant  has  submitted  an  Environment  Risk  Assessment  for  remimazolam  in  the  indication  of 
procedural sedation. All log D were below the limit of 4,5 so no further PBT assessment was conducted. 
Refined Fpen, PECSURFACE WATER is below the action limit of 0,01 µg/L. The applicant is currently conducting 
Tier A environmental fate and effect studies covering other indications with higher doses, so that potential 
hazards for environment are going to be investigated and detected in ongoing studies.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The  nonclinical  pharmacologic,  pharmacokinetic,  and  toxicologic  profile  of  remimazolam  has  been 
satisfactorily characterised by the applicant and supports the clinical use of remimazolam in the approved 
indication.

2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The  clinical  PK,  PD,  bioavailability,  cardiovascular  risk  and  abuse  liability  of  remimazolam  have  been 
assessed  in  single  dose,  multiple  bolus  doses  as  well  as  continuous  infusion  Phase  I  trials  in  healthy 
volunteers  and  in  hepatic  and  renal  impairment  patients  in  a  total  of  12  clinical  trials  involving  440 
subjects (357 on remimazolam). 
The safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of remimazolam have been investigated in 23 completed 
clinical  trials,  including  22  trials  in  which  remimazolam  was  administered  i.v.  The  22  trials  with  i.v. 
remimazolam were: 
12 Phase 1 trials: 
o  8 PK/PD, and cardiac function trials in healthy volunteers; 
o  1 trial in subjects with renal and 1 trial in subject with hepatic impairment; 
o  1 abuse liability trial in otherwise healthy recreational CNS depressant users. 
o  1 trial assessing PK, PD, safety and tolerability after oral RMZ administration with ethanol 
11 Phase 2-3 trials:  
o  5 in procedural sedation; 
o  5 in general anaesthesia; 
o  1 in intensive care unit (ICU) sedation. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The PK and PD of remimazolam were evaluated in healthy volunteers using weight-based ascending-dose 
IV boluses ranging from 0.01 to 0.5 mg/kg (CNS7056-001, ONO-2745-01). Multiple bolus administration 
was investigated in healthy patients undergoing colonoscopy (CNS7056-002). Two trials evaluated the 
PK/PD  of  remimazolam  administration  in  the  special  populations  of  patients  with  hepatic  impairment 
(ONO-2745-IVU007)  and  renal  impairment  (CNS7056-012).  In  these  trials,  the  following  main  PK 
properties of remimazolam were demonstrated: 
• 
The  decline  of  remimazolam  concentrations  following  bolus  dose  can  be  described  by  a  three 
compartment  model  characterised  by  mean  distribution  half-life  (t½α)  of  0.5  to  2  minutes 
(CNS7056-001,  ONO-2745-01),  elimination  half-life  (t½β)  of  7  to  11  minutes  and  terminal 
half-life (t½γ) of 38 to 52 minutes (ONO-2745-01) 
• 
• 
• 
• 
t½  is  prolonged  with  increasing  severity  of  hepatic  impairment,  but  is  not  affected  by  renal 
impairment (ONO-2745-IVU007, CNS7056-012) 
Cmax and AUC increase proportional with dose (CNS7056-001, ONO-2745-01) 
Rapid clearance from plasma; clearance is high (54 to 75 L/h) and not related to body weight

• 
• 
Rapid and extensive formation of the inactive metabolite CNS7054 by CES1 enzyme, the most 
relevant enzyme in the metabolism of remimazolam. 
In healthy subjects at least 80% (ONO 2745-01) and after pretreatment with laxative 50 to 60% 
(CNS7056-002) of the remimazolam dose is excreted in urine as CNS7054 within 24h. Unchanged 
RMZ is excreted in urine only to a negligible extent of 0.1%. 
Several plausible explanations for the observed difference between the studies were provided. Apart from 
CNS7056-002 being a multiple dose study where urinary excretion might not be complete after 24 hours, 
this was also a study in colonoscopy patients. Those patients received laxative prior to procedure which 
might have affected reabsorption from the GI tract and subsequently secretion in the urine. As a support 
to the claim that more than 80% of remimazolam is excreted in urine as inactive metabolite CNS7054 in 
healthy subjects, an additional reference (Sheng et al., 2020) was provided. In this study, after single 
intravenous  administration  to  Chinese  healthy  volunteers,  70.8  to  89.1%  of  remimazolam  dose  was 
excreted as metabolite CNS7054. 
Data from single IV administration in Japanese and Chinese healthy volunteers show that around 80% of 
remimazolam dose is excreted in urine in the form of inactive metabolite, CNS7054.  
In  colonoscopy  patients  administered  top-up  doses  of  remimazolam  who  received  laxative  prior  to 
procedure, 50-60% of the dose was excreted in urine as CNS7054.  
Metabolite profiling done in hepatocytes, HLMs, and human plasma and urine samples does not suggest 
any other metabolite than CNS7054 that would account for more than 1% of drug-related material. 
No  mass  balance  study  was  performed  with  remimazolam  which  would  have  provided  confirmatory 
evidence of the fraction metabolised to CNS7054. However, available data show that this fraction should 
be around 80% in healthy subjects and that hydrolysis of remimazolam to CNS7054 seems to be the 
major and only relevant metabolic pathway 
Furthermore: 
• 
• 
No significant difference in PK between healthy adults and healthy elderly subjects at the tested 
dose of 0.1 mg/kg was observed (ONO-2745-01) 
Total exposure to remimazolam was larger in patients with severe hepatic impairment than in 
healthy  subjects  and  patients  with  moderate  hepatic  impairment.  Modest  dose  adjustment 
(titration to effect) is expected only in severe hepatic impairment (ONO-2745-IVU007). Limited 
number  (n=3)  of  subjects  with  severe  hepatic  impairment  was  evaluated  in  the  hepatic 
impairment  study.  In  those  subjects,  unbound  remimazolam  Cmax  was  similar  to  values 
observed in healthy subjects and subjects with moderate hepatic impairment suggesting that no 
adjustment of the initial dose or subsequent top-up doses is required. In subjects with severe HI, 
mean unbound AUCinf increased approximately 2-fold compared to healthy subjects and half-life 
increased  accordingly.  Due  to  increased  remimazolam  half-life  in  severe  hepatic  impairment, 
lower frequency of top-up doses might be needed. The recommendation (included in the updated 
Product Information) for dosing of severely HI subjects is a more careful timing of the top-up 
doses. 
• 
The concentration-time profile and PK after a single IV dose of 1.5 mg remimazolam did not show 
relevant differences in ESRD subjects compared to subjects with normal renal function. No dose 
adjustment is required in renal impairment, including ESRD (CNS7056-012). 
Remimazolam is highly bound to plasma proteins (>90%). In study CNS7056-012 the possible 
effect  of  renal  impairment  on  the  unbound  plasma  concentrations  was  not  evaluated.  The 
Assessment report

potential  increase  in  unbound  concentrations  in  renally  impaired  subjects  was  not  considered 
clinically significant. 
Population  PK  analysis  pooled  data  from  11  clinical  trials.  The  PK/PD  model  developed  describes 
concentration-time data across patients and sedation scores over time in colonoscopy patients.  
• 
PK of remimazolam was well described using a three-compartment model. 
• 
Gender was found a significant covariate on CL and race on CL and Vss. The clearance was 10% 
higher in females than males. The Vss was 16% lower in African Americans than in Caucasians or 
Asians, and the CL was 13% lower. However, even if the effect was statistically significant it was 
not considered clinically relevant. Based on the results of the pop PK analysis, gender, race, ASA 
class,  weight  and  age  did  not  have  clinically  relevant  effect  on  the  remimazolam  PK.  Pop  PK 
analysis further indicate that gender and race are not significant factors to explain inter-subject 
variability of remimazolam PK. 
• 
The Population PK analysis also demonstrated that body weight and BMI were not a significant 
factor  contributing  to  inter-subject  variability  in  systemic  exposure,  hence  remimazolam  is 
recommended for fixed dosing. Since there is no evidence that dosing by body size will lead to 
decreased  variability  in  systemic  exposure  compared  to  using  fixed  doses,  weight-dependent 
dosing used in early clinical studies was switched to weight-independent dosing in the Phase 3 
clinical programme and the same posology is proposed in the product information. 
The  choice  of  doses  was  confirmed  using  the  pop  PK/PD  model  by  simulating  several  scenarios  with 
different doses of remimazolam and fentanyl to confirm proposed posology in Phase 3 studies. Although 
the rationale for sedative use is to titrate to effect, the applicability of the recommended body-weight 
independent  fixed  doses  also  to  patients  at  the  extreme  (low  and  high)  body  weights  was  further 
evaluated with simulations. Simulations with the proposed dosing regimen of initial 5 mg bolus dose of 
remimazolam were done to confirm that the same fixed dose would also be adequate for the patients at 
the  extreme  (low  and  high)  body  weights.  The  simulated  weight  range  was  35-170  kg.  Each  virtual 
subject received one single 1-minute infusion of 5 mg remimazolam. Venous plasma concentrations of 
remimazolam  were  predicted  at  3  and  5  minutes  after  start  of  infusion.  Simulations  of  remimazolam 
concentrations at 3 minutes (expected maximal concentrations) after start of infusion suggest that more 
than  50%  of  patients  of  body  weight  lower  than  70  kg,  could  reach  levels  above  the  concentration 
associated with loss of consciousness (500 ng/mL). It suggests that lower doses might be sufficient to 
reach desired level of sedation for patients with lower body weight. A change in the SmPC was introduced 
to recommend lower initial bolus dose (2.5 mg) in patients ≥65 years of age, with ASA-PS III-IV and/or 
body weight <50 kg. Further clarification on the chosen cut-off of 50 kg was provided by the applicant, 
based on the 3 min and 5 min simulation data for plasma concentrations after I.V. administration of a 2.5 
mg bolus. The provided simulations show that 50 kg body weight cut-off provides a good balance between 
the risk of potential oversedation and the need to administer a top up dose during the initiation of the 
procedure. This is adequately reflected in the dosing recommendations in the SmPC. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Effect of concomitant administration of CES1 inhibitors (lovastatin, simvastatin, clopidogrel, telmisartan, 
all pooled together, n=22) on remimazolam PK was assessed as a covariate in the PopPK model. No effect 
of this covariate on CL was shown.  
From the in vitro study and analysis of clinical data from patients that concomitantly administered 
simvastatin, there was no evidence for a clinically meaningful impact of simvastatin, as a potent CES-1 
inhibitor on remimazolam.  
Assessment report  
EMA/160756/2021  
Page 35/132 
 
 
 
Considering currently available data from in vitro DDI studies, the potential for clinically relevant 
interactions via CES-1 (for remimazolam both as a victim and a perpetrator) seems low. 
Possible effect of CES1 polymorphisms on remimazolam metabolism and its clinical relevance was not 
investigated, but comprehensive discussion was provided. According to the literature presented (Her and 
Zhu, 2019), a non-synonymous mutation (nsSNP) G143E, that causes complete loss of function of CES1, 
is the only clinically significant CES1 variant identified to date, associated with impact on PK of several 
CES1 substrates (methylphenidate, clopidogrel, enalapril, oseltamivir, dabigatran etexilate and 
sacubitril). Overall, there is no clinical data to confirm whether a genetic polymorphism such as G143E 
would have a clinically relevant effect on remimazolam exposure. Considering that individual dose 
titration will be put in place and specific antidote available, this information will not be requested. 
The interaction potential of remimazolam and its metabolite CNS7054 has been tested in a number of in 
vitro studies. Remimazolam and CNS7054 caused no relevant competitive nor time-dependent inhibition 
of cytochrome P450 iso-enzymes 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4. There were no inducing effects 
on CYP1A2, 2B6, and 3A4. Remimazolam was not a relevant substrate of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, BCRP, and 
MDR1. CNS7054 was found to be a substrate of MDR1 and BCRP, but not of MRP2-4.  
Both remimazolam and CNS7054 caused no or no relevant inhibition of a panel of human drug 
transporters (OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT2, MATE1, MATE2-K, BCRP, BSEP, and MDR1).  
A justification for not evaluating the potential for remimazolam and its metabolite to cause inhibition of 
UGTs was provided and is considered satisfactory. 
These results together show a very low potential of remimazolam for interactions, neither as a victim nor 
as a perpetrator. Nevertheless, in the context of a possible future extension of indication (such as general 
anaesthesia) the DDI potential will be re-evaluated. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
The  clinical  PK,  PD,  bioavailability,  cardiovascular  risk  and  abuse  liability  of  remimazolam  have  been 
assessed  in  single  dose,  multiple  bolus  doses  as  well  as  continuous  infusion  Phase  I  trials  in  healthy 
volunteers  and  in  hepatic  and  renal  impairment  patients  in  a  total  of  12  clinical  trials  involving  440 
subjects (357 on remimazolam). 
The safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of remimazolam have been investigated in 23 completed 
clinical  trials,  including  22  trials  in  which  remimazolam  was  administered  i.v.  The  22  trials  with  i.v. 
remimazolam were: 
12 Phase 1 trials: 
o  8 PK/PD, and cardiac function trials in healthy volunteers; 
o  1 trial in subjects with renal and 1 trial in subject with hepatic impairment; 
o  1 abuse liability trial in otherwise healthy recreational CNS depressant users. 
o  1 trial assessing PK, PD, safety and tolerability after oral RMZ administration with ethanol 
11 Phase 2-3 trials:  
o  5 in procedural sedation; 
o  5 in general anaesthesia; 
o  1 in intensive care unit (ICU) sedation. 
One additional Phase I trial investigated the interaction of oral remimazolam with alcohol.

The  pharmacological  rational  for  the  use  of  Byfavo  is  adequately  supported  by  bibliography  and  by 
already approved medications. 
Mechanism of action 
The  mechanism of  action of  Byfavo  (remimazolam)  is  by  binding to  GABAA  receptor  and  acting  as  its 
agonist,  enhancing  its  function.  This  mechanism  of  action  is  shared  by  the  members  of  the 
pharmacological group of benzodiazepines and is widely known. Similarly, to other benzodiazepines, no 
specific selectivity among GABAA receptor subunits was identified and no evidence of off-target activities 
of remimazolam or its metabolite has been identified in non-clinical or clinical studies.  
Remimazolam is an agonist at the benzodiazepine site of the GABAA receptor. It shares its sedative and 
other pharmacological properties with other members of this class like midazolam. It is a chirally pure 
molecule (S enantiomer) and is isolated as the besylate salt. Unlike other benzodiazepines remimazolam 
is  an  ester  which  is  rapidly  broken  down  by  liver  carboxyesterases  to  its  pharmacologically  inactive 
metabolite CNS7054.  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Equi-effectiveness of 0.075 mg/kg of remimazolam and midazolam were deduced from the results of the 
phase  I  trial  CNS7056-001  and  refers  to  their  maximal  effect  (i.e.  Emax)  but  not  to  the  duration  of 
sedation (area under the time-effect curve) which was much longer for midazolam than for remimazolam.  
While there is a phase I trial demonstrating equi-potency of midazolam and remimazolam with respect to 
peak  sedation,  there  is  no  such  comparison  available  for  amnesia.  However,  equi-effectiveness 
demonstrated in the phase III clinical trials and that under conditions of clinically acceptable sedation the 
recall of the procedure was also comparable. 
The applicant presented data analysis that indicates that there is no statistically significant difference in 
the recall of the procedure between all treatment groups. This indicates that remimazolam in the tested 
dosing regimen has the same amnestic properties as midazolam dosed at the investigator’s discretion 
(randomised placebo group), as well as label-dosed midazolam.  
The  ability  to  prevent  recall  of  any  procedure-related  episode  was  reported  by  the  applicant  to  be  in 
approximately 75% of all patients, independent of the treatment administered, further supported by an 
overall very high sedation satisfaction rating. The 592 remimazolam-treated patients scored on average 
9.5 points on a 10-point scale (0= completely dissatisfied, 10=completely satisfied) versus an average of 
9.3 points from 118 placebo-treated patients and 9.5 points from the 166 midazolam-treated patients. 
This difference is not statistically significant (p=0.2060 for placebo and p=1.0000 for midazolam).  
Although listed prospectively as a secondary endpoint in the trial protocols and the statistical analyses 
plans, no formal statistical hypothesis with regards to recall was tested by any of the trials.  
Therefore, all of the aforementioned statistical results were produced through post-hoc analyses.  
Primary Pharmacology 
To  characterise  the  primary  pharmacology  of  remimazolam  5  trials  were  performed  with  3  different 
administration  protocols: Single  Bolus Intravenous Administration  (CNS7056-001  and  ONO-2745-01), 
Multiple  Bolus  IV  Administrations  (CNS7056-002)  and  Continuous  IV  Infusion  (ONO-2745-02  and 
CNS7056-017). The primary PD clinical endpoint used in these trials was the assessment of sedation/loss 
of consciousness (LoC) according to the MOAA/S score (Modified Observer’s Assessment Of Alertness/ 
Assessment report  
EMA/160756/2021  
Page 37/132 
 
 
 
Sedation) although some of the studies either cross-referenced with the BIS (bispectral index) in PK/PD 
simulations. 
Modified Observer’s Assessment of Alertness/ Sedation (MOAA/S) scores were used as the primary PD 
endpoint in bolus trials. This is in line with the objectives in clinical practice and considered to be a good 
sedation marker. This parameter (or variations of it) is routinely used in clinical practice to assess the 
level of sedation during medical procedures. The score ranges from 0 (loss of consciousness) to 5 (fully 
alert), and scores in-between indicating mild (4), moderate (2-3) and deep (1) sedation. 
Additionally, there is a trend for the average BIS to decrease with the MOAA/S scores. However, there is 
also large variability which partially results from the hysteresis effect i.e. remimazolam changes the state 
of consciousness which is directly represented by the MOAA/S score while the change in the BIS are a 
consequence of this changed state of consciousness and appear with a temporal delay. Analysis of the 
slopes of the curve obtained in the Logistic regression analysis of BIS against MOAA/S indicates a good 
correlation  between  the  two  pharmacodynamics  endpoints  and  the  range  is  compatible  with  the  BIS 
target range for propofol anaesthesia. There was also a clear dose-response relationship between the 
bolus dose of remimazolam (0.05-0.5 mg/kg; ONO-2745-01) and the minimal BIS value (Emax).  
BIS was established as a valid endpoint to assess remimazolam-induced sedation in context of procedural 
sedation and general anaesthesia and that this endpoint responded with good sensitivity and specificity to 
remimazolam.  
At dose levels above 0.05 mg/kg, the probability for a consistent MOAA/S <4 was >80%. This was also 
the  lowest  dose  at  which  loss  of  consciousness  was  observed  in  healthy  volunteers.  The  duration  of 
unconsciousness ranged from a single time-point only at the lower doses to a median duration of 15 min 
at the highest dose tested (i.e. 0.5 mg/kg).  
At equi-effective doses the median duration of unconsciousness was longer for midazolam (4 min at 0.075 
mg/kg) as compared to remimazolam (a single time point only at 0.075 mg/kg). In elderly subjects there 
was a slightly increased sensitivity as evidenced by a higher proportion of subjects losing consciousness 
at  a  dose  of  0.1  mg/kg  (100%  vs  ~50%  in  non-elderly)  and  a  slightly  prolonged  duration  of 
unconsciousness (mean of 3.8 min vs 0.6 min in non-elderly). 
Recovery of consciousness lasted 9.5 min following remimazolam and was considerably shorter than that 
with  midazolam  (90  min)  at  an  equi-effective  dose.  Recovery  from  consciousness  was  not  different 
between <65 years old subjects and elderly (mean 22 min at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg for both groups). 
There was some pharmacodynamic differences between remimazolam and midazolam in the non-clinical 
model, mainly the lower threshold dose for inducing amnesia for midazolam (0.2 mg/kg) as compared to 
remimazolam (0.5 mg/kg). The absence of translation to clinical setting regarding those differences was 
justified by some PK and PD translation differences and further supported by a meta
analysis of results 
from nine trials with 587 participants comparing iv midazolam for procedural sedation to iv diazepam that 
revealed that those who received midazolam presented a similar percentage of patients not recalling the 
‐
procedure (80%) when compared to remimazolam in trial CNS7056-002.  
The sedative effect of remimazolam was shown to be rapidly reversed by administration of flumazenil, a 
benzodiazepine antagonist, with no re-sedation observed after the reversal of sedation with flumazenil. 
On study ONO-2745-01, remimazolam 0.1 mg/kg induced loss of conscious in 5 of the 5 healthy elderly 
male  Japanese  subjects  compared  to  only  1  of  the  5  healthy  adult  male  subjects  at  0.1  mg/kg. 
Additionally, the mean duration of loss of consciousness after administration of remimazolam 0.1 mg/kg 
was 3.8 minutes in healthy elderly male subjects, which was comparable to that at 0.3 mg/kg in healthy 
adult male subjects (3.6 minutes). A modelling study additionally indicated a slower (~20%) recovery 
from sedation in elderly compared to non-elderly. However, analysis of phase III trials CNS7056-006, 
Assessment report  
EMA/160756/2021  
Page 38/132 
 
 
 
CNS7056-008 and CNS7056-015 did not reveal a clinically significant age effect and that no difference in 
the  pharmacokinetics  between  elderly  and  young  subjects.  Additionaly,  results  from  a  modelling  and 
simulation  approach  was  used  to  describe  the  pharmacokinetics  (PK)  and  pharmacodynamics  (PD)  of 
remimazolam from 11 clinical trials suggest that there appears to be a PD effect related to increased age 
that is small and unlikely to be clinically relevant in most elderly patients. Also, the PD effect described on 
the duration of sedation was a slightly (2-3 min) longer recovery in elderly patients. When simulating the 
depth  of  sedation  with  different  dosing  regimens  (fentanyl/remimazolam  dose  combinations)  the 
percentage of subjects in the elderly group with adequate or too deep a sedation was 4-6% higher while 
it was 4-6% lower for no or too light sedation.  
An advice in the SmPC was included regarding standard vs. non-standard dosing. The standard dosing is 
expected to be suitable for a healthy elderly patient. Non-standard dosing has a lower initial bolus and 
lower top-up doses and is to be used after the HCP has considered a few key factors such as overall health 
status  (i.e.  ASA  class)  and  body  weight.  A  non-standard  dose  can  be  considered  by  the  health  care 
professional for an underweight elderly patient with an ASA class of III or IV.  
Guidance for administration of a top-up only in a titration-to-effect manner, in case additional sedation 
justified/needed by clinical observation considerably reduces the risk of increased sedation. Additionally, 
the update of the SmPC with further advice regarding standard vs. non-standard dosing might further 
reduce the risk of increased sedation with initial dosing. 
Regarding  a  proper  use  of  flumazenil  in  an  elderly  population,  including  dosing  and  possibility  of 
re-sedation, data was presented from from the phase III procedural sedation clinical trials CNS7056-006 
(colonoscopy),  CNS7056-008  (bronchoscopy),  and  CNS7056-015  (colonoscopy  in  ASA-  PS  III-IV 
patients), useful for assessing potential differences between elderly and non-elderly in clinical practice. 
Although the requirement for flumazenil was assessed as a secondary objective in these phase III trials, 
not a single patient in the remimazolam treatment arms required flumazenil so there are no clinical data 
on flumazenil in remimazolam treated elderly or non-elderly in these trials.  
The PK/PD analysis of the single ascending bolus dose trials indicates a plasma target concentration of 
189  ng/mL  for  moderate  sedation  (MOAA/S=3).  Simulations  using  the  PK/PD  model  for  bolus  dosing 
predict  an  effect  site  concentration  of  190  ng/mL  for  the  highest  probability  of  being  in  the  targeted 
MOAA/S range of 2-4 for colonoscopies and bronchoscopies. While the effect site compartment in PK/PD 
modelling is a virtual compartment used to predict the PD of a drug, the most plausible physiological 
correlate for an anesthetic drug for the effect site compartment is the brain. 
The target plasma and effect site concentration for induction of moderate sedation in subjects undergoing 
an unpleasant or painful procedure or examination (e.g. colonoscopy) was found to be around 200 ng/mL. 
Secondary Pharmacology 
The effect of remimazolam on cardiac conduction and QT interval was investigated in two Phase 1 clinical 
trials (CNS7056-005 and CNS7056-017). In addition, a meta-analysis of all ECGs generated in the other 
clinical trials was performed to assess potential effects of remimazolam. 
In  the thorough  QT  clinical  trial  CNS7056-005  a  bolus  injection  was  used,  whereas  in the  PK/PD  trial 
CNS7056-017, which also examined the QT interval, an infusion was used to eliminate bias of rapid and 
transient increases in heart rate.  
Remimazolam’s potential effect on the ECG was initially evaluated in a thorough QT-trial (CNS7056-005). 
Overall, the results from CNS7056-005 show that remimazolam has no direct effect on QTc or other ECG 
intervals such as PR, ST or QRS. The timepoint analysis of the tQT trial showed an increase in QTcI shortly 
after bolus dosing that slightly exceeded the threshold of regulatory concern. 
Assessment report  
EMA/160756/2021  
Page 39/132 
 
 
 
In order to clearly determine the contribution of the QT-RR hysteresis effect to the small QTc effect noted 
only in the first few minutes after the remimazolam dosing, a second follow-up trial was designed by the 
applicant to assess the ECG effects of remimazolam using an infusion protocol intended to produce stable 
plasma concentrations of remimazolam (CNS7056-017), trial that the applicant stated “it complied with 
standards  of  thorough  QT  trials  (CNS7056-017)”.  This  trial  was  designed  to  measure  the  QT  interval 
under conditions of stable heart rate at the same plasma concentrations as the Cmax of the therapeutic 
and  supratherapeutic  dose  in  CNS7056-005.  No  remimazolam-induced  change  in  QTcI  was  observed 
under these conditions. 
Use of a positive control in the thorough study CNS7056-005 for evaluation of influence in the QT interval 
was  performed  but  not  for  the  follow-up  trial  CNS7056-017.  The  two  trials  used  the  same  ECG 
measurement methodology by a centralised ECG core lab blinded to treatment assignment, as well as the 
same  statistical  methodology.  Applicant  data  and  literature  references  were  presented  regarding  the 
effect of meal in QT interval as potential positive controls, in comparison of the effect of moxifloxacin. The 
applicant then stated that both CNS7056-005 and CNS7056-017 demonstrated the small HR increase and 
QTc decrease expected following a meal. The extent of these changes was found by the applicant to be 
remarkably similar indicating a similar sensitivity to meal-induced ECG changes in both trials.  
Pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products or substances 
No  dedicated  pharmacodynamic  interactions  study  was  performed  in  the  clinical  development  of 
remimazolam, although in study CNS7056-008 (a phase 3 bronchoscopy trial) patients with long term use 
of opioids or benzodiazepines were enrolled. 
The CNS7056-020 trial assessed the effect of remimazolam when administered orally with and without 
various concentrations of ethanol. The results of this trial demonstrate that due to the sheer amount of 
remimazolam and alcohol (18 vials of remimazolam (360 mg) and 150 mL of 40% alcohol) needed to 
produce significant sedation in a single female subject (1 of 10), together with the remarkably bitter taste 
of remimazolam and the adverse reactions caused by the combination (emesis, cardiovascular) do not 
suggest any potential for the remimazolam−alcohol combination to incapacitate a victim. 
Although it appears that no clinically relevant PD drug-drug interaction occurred in Phase 2/3 trials in 
which  other  medicines  where  administered,  there  is  not  enough  data  to  exclude  the  possibility  of 
synergism in sedation and even respiratory/cardiovascular depression. 
Genetic differences in PD response 
At the time of MAA assessment, only one clinical trial assessing the effect of GABRA1 polymorphisms on 
the sensitivity to a benzodiazepine (midazolam) was published. The hypothesis of the study was based on 
results  from  in  vitro  and  animal  studies  suggesting  that  mutations  in  GABA  subunits  can  reduce 
benzodiazepine sensitivity. The differences between polymorphisms in the total dose of midazolam and 
the lowest BIS, although statistically significant, are of little clinical relevance and no conclusion can be 
made regarding their effects in the clinical outcome of remimazolam. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
The relationship between plasma concentration of remimazolam and effect was well established both in 
direct  measurements  and PK/PD  modeling.  The  plasma  concentration  of  remimazolam  correlates  well 
with the primary endpoint (MOAA/S). 
For induction of medical procedures e.g. colonoscopies or bronchoscopies often a MOAA/S of 3 represents 
an adequate level of sedation. The Figure 2 below shows the probability for a MOAA/S <4 in dependence 
of dose. At dose levels above 0.05 mg/kg, the probability for a MOAA/S <4 in both trials was >80%. The 
dose  0.05  mg/kg  was  also  the  lowest  dose  at  which  loss  of  consciousness  was  observed  in  healthy 
Assessment report

volunteers. The duration of unconsciousness ranged from a single time-point only at the lower doses to a 
median duration of 15 min at the highest dose tested (i.e. 0.5 mg/kg). 
The PK/PD analysis of the single ascending bolus dose trials indicates a plasma target concentration of 
189  ng/mL  for  moderate  sedation  (MOAA/S=3).  Simulations  using  the  PK/PD  model  for  bolus  dosing 
predict  an  effect  site  concentration  of  190  ng/mL  for  the  highest  probability  of  being  in  the  targeted 
MOAA/S range of 2-4 for colonoscopies and bronchoscopies. 
A population pharmacodynamic model with respect to the MOAA/S score as clinical measure of sedation 
was successfully developed using sigmoid probability functions. The pharmacodynamic model for MOAA/S 
score revealed a relatively fast onset of sedation with a time to peak of about 3 min and a fast recovery 
with  a  context-sensitive  half-time  of  about  10  min.  There  were  no  effects  of  age  and  weight  on  the 
pharmacodynamics with respect to MOAA/S score. 
A paper by Schuttler and colleagues (Schuttler et al, 2020) performed the pharmacodynamic modeling of 
the  Modified  Observer’s  Assessment  of  Alertness  and  Sedation  scores  which  was  investigated  with  a 
logistic  regression  model  and  with  a  sigmoid  model  (Hill  equation)  for  the  cumulative  probabilities. 
Although these two models are both characterised by con- centration-effect curves with a sigmoid shape, 
the  logistic  regression  model  showed  a  worse  quality  of  fit.  This  may  be  explained  by  the  different 
behaviour of the two models at baseline when no drug was present. In this case, the probability to achieve 
a  Modified  Observer’s  Assessment  of  Alertness  and  Sedation  score  at  or  below  4  equals  zero  for  the 
sigmoid model but not for the logistic regression model. However, because all subjects in this study were 
alert  (Modified  Observer’s  Assessment  of  Alertness  and  Sedation  score  =  5)  at  baseline,  the  sigmoid 
model was more appropriate. The use of the sigmoid model by the applicant was therefore appropriate. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology is very thorough and supported by 12 Phase 1 trials, either PK, PD, PK/PD or 
related to cardiovascular effects. The PK/PD studies were very thorough and were complemented with 
PK/PD modelling relating remimazolam concentrations in several types of administration with PD markers 
of sedation. 
BIS was established as a valid endpoint to assess remimazolam-induced sedation in context of procedural 
sedation and general anaesthesia and this endpoint responded with good sensitivity and specificity to 
remimazolam with similar trends in profile compared to MOAA/S. 
Although remimazolam acts by a well-known mechanism (agonism of GABA receptor), it is however a new 
active substance and there is still an uncertainty regarding the particular subunits it acts on. While there 
appears to have a similarity in terms of doses necessary for induction of sedation between remimazolam 
and midazolam, there appears to be a discrepancy in the doses necessary to induce amnesia, evidenced 
in non-clinical development, which was adequately discussed and equipotency was established in Phase 3 
trials. Amnestic effect was added as an additional pharmacodynamic effect to section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Remimazolam administration can be associated with a transient increase in heart rate (10-20 beats per 
minute) starting as early as 30 seconds after the start of dosing (corresponding to the time of maximum 
concentration of remimazolam) before resolving within about 30 minutes after the end of administration. 
This increase in heart rate coincides with a decrease in blood pressure and it may confound QT correction 
for  heart  rate  translating  into  a  small  prolongation  in  QTcF  in  the  first  few  minutes  following  dosing. 
Section 4.4 of the Summary of Product Characteristics was updated to include this warning.  
Given its pharmacological characteristics it is plausible that remimazolam will have limited PD interactions 
with other medicinal products and substances other than the ones acting also in the Central Nervous

System  as  CNS  depressants  and/or  sedatives.  The  SmPC  was  updated  with  more  specific 
recommendations for dosing guidelines in case of opioid co-administration. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology of remimazolam has been characterised sufficiently.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The  Summary  of  studies  submitted  in  support  of  this  application  is  presented  in  Table  3  below. 
Colonoscopy  and  bronchoscopy  were  chosen  as  model  procedures  to  reflect  different  levels  of 
invasiveness,  duration  of  stimulus,  and  to  enrol  a  representative  population  likely  to  be  treated  with 
remimazolam post marketing. The Phase III trials were designed in alignment with the FDA to enable a 
claim for a broad indication covering all therapeutic and diagnostic procedures where sedation is required.

2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
The first dose finding study, CNS7056-003, was a phase II efficacy trial.  
Dose-response  study  1:  CNS7056-003  "A  Phase  2a,  Randomized,  Controlled, 
Double-Blind, Dose-Finding Study Evaluating the Safety and Pharmacodynamics of CNS 7056 
in Patients Undergoing Diagnostic Upper GI Endoscopy" 
For the induction and maintenance of procedural sedation in adults, the proposed dose/administration 
route is remimazolam administered IV at an initial bolus dose of 5.0 mg (infused over 1 minute) with 
supplemental doses of 2.5 mg (as an IV push injection over 15 seconds) to induce or maintain adequate 
sedation. In debilitated patients (American Society of Anesthesiologists [ASA] Score III-IV), a lower initial 
dose  in  the  range  of  2.5  to  5  mg  with  supplemental  doses  of  1.25  to  2.5  mg  can  be  utilised  at  the 
discretion of the physician. 
Methods 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to assess the safety and efficacy of CNS 7056 (remimazolam) administered as 
a single 1-minute intravenous (IV) injection, at 3 dose levels, compared to midazolam.  
Overall design 
This  was  a  Phase  IIa,  multi-centre,  randomised,  double-blind,  parallel-group,  dose-finding  study 
assessing the  safety  and efficacy  of  3  dose levels of  CNS  7056  compared  with  midazolam  in  patients 
undergoing diagnostic upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy.  
On the day of procedure, patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups: CNS 7056 0.10 
mg/kg, 0.15 mg/kg, or 0.20 mg/kg; or midazolam 0.075 mg/kg, delivered as a single IV injection over 1 
minute. The endoscopy was to be started when Modified Observer’s Assessment of Alertness/Sedation 
(MOAA/S) ≤ 3 had been reached, but no earlier than 90 seconds after the start of study drug injection). 
Rescue  with  sedative  medication  (midazolam  1-2  mg)  was  permitted  at  the  discretion  of  the 
administering physician.

Primary endpoint 
The primary efficacy variable was success of the endoscopy procedure (a composite endpoint consisting 
of the following): 
•  MOAA/S ≤ 4 on 3 consecutive measurements 
•  Completion of the endoscopy procedure 
•  No requirement for rescue sedative medication 
•  No manual or mechanical ventilation 
Secondary endpoints 
• 
Time to fully alert (time to first of 3 consecutive MOAA/S scores of 5 beginning at or after the end 
of the endoscopy procedure, which was clarified to mean time to first of 3 consecutive MOAA/S 
scores  of  5  following  study  drug  administration  in  patients  who  underwent  the  endoscopy 
procedure) 
• 
Time to ready for discharge (time to first of 3 consecutive Aldrete scores ≥ 9) 
•  No requirement for rescue sedative medication 
Number of subjects (planned and analysed) 
Planned: 100 patients (25 patients in each treatment group) 
Analysed: 100 patients (Safety population); 100 patients (intent-to-treat [ITT] population); 49 patients 
(modified intent-to-treat [mITT] population) 
Results 
A total of 100 subjects were enrolled and included in the ITT analysis, 25 subjects in each treatment 
group. There were 46 males and 54 females with a median age of 41.0 years (range: 18–65 years). The 
race of all subjects was 95% White and 5% Black, the ethnicity was 46% Hispanic, and the average BMI 
was 25.9 kg/m2.

Table 4: Main Efficacy Results (Study 003) 
Although a dose-response relationship was observed for the endoscopy success rate and the proportion of 
subjects requiring rescue sedative medication, the single-dose application was considered inappropriate 
to  ensure  adequate  sedation  for  endoscopic  procedures.  Trial  CNS7056-004  therefore  explored  three 
different initial bolus / top-up regimens with remimazolam.

Treatments and overall design 
Study  004  was  a  double  blind,  randomised,  controlled,  multicentre,  parallel  dose-response  phase  2b 
study  evaluating  safety  and  efficacy  of  remimazolam  compared  to  midazolam  in  patients  undergoing 
colonoscopy. 
Patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 possible study groups (1:1:1:1) to receive an initial single IV 
dose of either CNS7056 (8.0 mg, 7.0 mg or 5.0 mg) or midazolam (2.5 mg) at one of the following dose 
levels: 
Table 5: Study 004 Treatments (source: CSR) 
Possible top-up doses: 
1.  If  adequate  sedation  (MOAA/S  ≥  3)  for  the  start  of  the  colonoscopy  procedure  could  not  be 
achieved with the initial dose, up to a maximum of 2 top-up doses of study medication (CNS7056 
3.0 mg for the 8.0 mg and 5.0 mg initial doses, CNS7056 2.0 mg for the 7.0 mg initial dose, or 
midazolam 1 mg) administered as IV boluses over approximately 15 seconds were allowed no less 
than 2 minutes apart and only if MOAA/S was ≥ 4. 
2.  To maintain the patient at an adequate sedation level for the duration of the procedure (MOAA/S 
≤ 4, measured every minute), subsequent doses of study medication were administered at least 
2 minutes apart up to a maximum total dose of 6 doses; ie, if 2 additional doses were used for 
achieving the sedation level for insertion of the colonoscope, only 4 more additional doses could 
be administered for maintaining the sedation during the procedure. 
Assessment report

Pre-treatment  and  rescue  analgesia:  All  patients  received  fentanyl  100  μg  immediately  prior  to  the 
administration of study medication after a fluid load of at least 500 mL (patients received normal saline 
500-1000 mL drip starting prior to the procedure). If additional pain relief was required, as indicated by 
hypertension, tachycardia, or movement while sedated (MOAA/S ≤ 4), fentanyl top-up doses of 25 μg 
were allowed at least 5 minutes apart (up to a total of 200 μg). 
Rescue sedation: According to the protocol, alternative sedatives could be other benzodiazepines as e.g. 
midazolam, or propofol, or other sedative agents (at the discretion of the investigator). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint (composite): 
•  MOAA/S ≤ 4 on 3 consecutive measurements taken every minute, AND 
• 
• 
• 
completion of the procedure (including if alternative sedative medication was used), AND 
no requirement for an alternative sedative, AND 
no manual or mechanical ventilation. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints: 
1) MOAA/S scores by time point. 2) Aldrete scores by time point. 3) Time to fully alert (time to first of 
three  MOAA/S  scores  of  5  after  the  last  injection  of  double-blind  study  medication).  4)  Time  to  peak 
sedation (time of the first lowest MOAA/S score) after the start of first injection of study drug. 5) Time to 
ready for discharge (time to first of 3 consecutive Aldrete scores ≥ 9): after the start of the last injection

Safety endpoints: The type of individual (e.g. anesthesiologist/nurse anesthesiologist or person trained in 
Advanced  Cardiac  Life  Support  [ACLS])  responsible  for  monitoring  the  patient,  incidence  of 
treatment-emergent  adverse  events  (TEAEs)  and  Adverse  Events  of  Special  Interest  (AESI),  physical 
examination  findings,  vital  signs  (supine  heart  rate,  systolic  and  diastolic  blood  pressure  [BP],  and 
respiration  rate),  electrocardiograms  (ECGs),  pulse  oximetry  measurements,  clinical  laboratory  test 
results,  rate  of  oxygen  flow,  exhaled  carbon  dioxide  concentrations  where  available,  preventive 
interventions to avoid an Adverse Event of Special Interest (AESI) and pain on injection intensity rating. 
PK endpoint (in a subgroup of patients). 
Sample size 
The  sample  size  was  determined  based  on  results  of  previous  studies  and  was  expected  to  provide 
sufficient data to examine dose levels of CNS7056 for sedation during colonoscopy. Since sample size was 
not statistically calculated, power was not determined, and no inferential statistical conclusions could be 
determined from the outcome of this study. A total of 160 patients was planned to be enrolled in this 
study.

Results  
Baseline data 
The  applicant  presented  tabulated  baseline  characteristics  for  each  group  and  average  numbers.  The 
average age of patients was approximately 55 years across all treatment groups, and 55% of patients 
were female. Patients were predominantly white (86%), and not of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity (78%). 
The overall mean BMI was 27.0 kg/m2. Majority of patients had ASA I (44.1%) or ASA II score (53.4%). 
Outcomes and estimation 
All  patients  were  successfully  sedated  (MOAA/S  ≤  4  on  3  consecutive  measurements),  and  all  of  the 
patients except for 1 CNS7056 5.0/3.0 mg patient completed the colonoscopy procedure. Fewer patients 
required  rescue  sedative  medication  in  the  CNS7056  treatment  groups  (3,  2,  and  1  in  the  8.0/3.0, 
7.0/2.0,  and  5.0/3.0  groups,  respectively),  compared  to  10  patients  (25%)  in  the  midazolam  group. 
These  differences  were  statistically  significant  (p=0.007,  Fisher's  exact  test).  Fisher’s  exact  test 
documented the 7.0/2.0 and 5.0/3.0 treatment groups to be statistically superior to midazolam (p=0.007 
and 0.025 respectively). The 8.0/3.0 group was not statistically superior to midazolam (p=0.066). No 
patients required manual or mechanical ventilation.

Secondary efficacy results (most important) 
Figure 2: MOAA/S Score against study time point (Study 004, ITT population) 
As shown in Figure 2 above, for the ITT population the CNS7056 treatments led to quicker (1.5 to 2.0 
minutes) and deeper sedation compared to midazolam treatment. The deepest sedation with CNS7056 
was observed after approximately 2 minutes, with the highest loading dose (8.0 mg) giving the deepest 
sedation (MOAA/S 1), compared with a MOAA/S of 2 in the other CNS7056 treatment groups. The onset 
of sedation appeared to be slower with midazolam, and the depth shallower, as the peak depth of MOAA/S 
2.5 was not reached until approximately 15 minutes.

Table 7: Time to event Secondary Endpoints (Study 004, ITT population) 
Between the two top-up doses of 2 mg and 3 mg, the 2 mg dose resulted in more subjects who recalled 
the procedure. Brice Questionnaire results showed that 92.5%, 70.0%, 90.0%, and 87.5% of subjects 
treated with 8.0/3.0 mg, 7.0/2.0 mg, 5.0/3.0 mg remimazolam, and 2.5/1.0 mg midazolam, respectively, 
could not remember anything about the procedure at 10 min after fully alert. This indicated that the 2 mg 
top-up dose was slightly inferior compared to the 3 mg top-up doses. Implementing a simple calculation 
as risk mitigation for dosing errors, the top-up dose was set at 50% of the initial dose (i.e. 2.5 mg) in the 
Phase III trials. 
Additionally, an important aspect of study drug administration in this field, and particularly with a short 
acting agent, is the number of top-up doses that are required in order to (a) start the procedure, and (b) 
complete the procedure overall. The number of top-ups to start the procedure was lower in the CNS7056 
groups (mean of 0.10, 0.30 and 0.18 for the 8.0/3.0, 7.0/2.0 and 5.0/3.0 groups, respectively) compared 
to the midazolam group (0.93). This would usually translate to a shorter time to the start of procedure, 
which can be seen from the mean time to procedure start from administration of the first dose of study 
drug (2.23, 3.03, and 2.65 minutes for the CNS7056 8.0/3.0, 7.0/2.0 and 5.0/3.0 groups, respectively) 
compared 4.80 minutes for the midazolam group. Overall, the number of top-ups required throughout the 
whole procedure, including sedation induction, was generally lower for the CNS7056 groups (mean of 
1.43,  2.35,  and  1.98  for  the  8.0/3.0,  7.0/2.0,  and  5.0/3.0  groups,  respectively)  compared  to  the 
midazolam group (2.48).

Treatments and overall design 
The  study  is  a  Phase  3  prospective,  multicentre,  randomised,  double-blind  placebo  and  open-label 
midazolam study in patients undergoing a colonoscopy for diagnostic or therapeutic reasons. 
Patients were randomised into one of three groups: remimazolam (double-blind); placebo (double-blind) 
and midazolam (open-label). All patients received fentanyl to provide analgesia and 0.9% NaCl solution 
up to 1,000 mL drip starting prior to the procedure, if their fluid status allowed. For rescue sedation, only 
midazolam was allowed.  
Assessment report  
EMA/160756/2021  
Page 51/132 
 
 
 
After pre-treatment with fentanyl, subjects received an initial dose of 5.0 mg remimazolam or matching 
placebo over 1 min or 1.75 mg midazolam over 2 min (or 1.0 mg midazolam for adults ≥60 years of age 
or debilitated or chronically ill). For the remimazolam and placebo arms, supplemental doses of 2.5 mg at 
least 2 min apart were allowed until adequate sedation (MOAA/S score ≤3) was achieved and as necessary 
to maintain sedation (MOAA/S ≤4). For midazolam, supplemental doses of 1.0 mg over 2 min with 2 min 
between doses (or 0.5 mg for the elderly) were allowed to achieve and maintain adequate sedation. 
The number of supplemental doses of study drug throughout the procedure was not limited; however, 
more than 5 doses (including the initial dose) within any 15-min period for remimazolam/placebo or more 
than  3  doses  (including  the  initial  dose)  within  any  12-min  period  for  midazolam  were  considered 
treatment failure. In these cases, subjects received sedative rescue medication (i.e., midazolam dosed at 
the investigator’s discretion) to complete the procedure. 
Fentanyl  was  administered  for  pain  control.  Fentanyl  was  originally  administered  at  a  dose  of  75  μg 
immediately before administration of the initial dose of the study medication. The dose was reduced to 50 
μg  in  Protocol  Amendment  4.  Suitable  dose  reductions  for  elderly  and  debilitated  subjects,  and 
supplemental doses of 25 μg fentanyl every 5-10 min were allowed until adequate analgesia was achieved 
or a maximum dose of 200 μg per procedure had been reached.

• 
Randomisation 
Prior  to  dosing,  patients  will  be  randomly  assigned  in  a  30:6:10  ratio  to  remimazolam,  placebo,  and 
open-label midazolam. The randomisation schedule will be computer-generated using a permuted block 
algorithm and will randomly allocate study drug randomisation numbers. The unblinded pharmacist will 
call  the  central  IWRS  and  enter  the  requested  information.  The  IWRS  will  then  assign  the  next 
randomisation number in the sequence and inform the pharmacist of the study treatment assignment. 
Randomisation will be stratified by age group and the strata will be monitored to ensure that at least 100 
remimazolam patients in the ≥ 65 yrs age group will be randomised.  
• 
Blinding (masking) 
The unblinded pharmacist prepared the study drug. The identity of the blinded study drugs (remimazolam 
and  placebo)  was  not  revealed  to  study  management  or  to  anyone  at  the  study  site  except  for  the 
pharmacist, the pharmacy staff and Premier’s unblinded monitor until after the study is completed. The 
pharmacist and staff will not participate in other study procedures. Patients were blinded to treatment. 
Midazolam arm was open label.

Statistical methods 
Analysis populations 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The safety population will consist of all randomised patients who receive any amount of study 
drug and will be analyzed as treated 
The intent-to-treat analysis set (ITT) will include all patients who were randomised and will be 
analyzed as randomised 
The  modified  intent-to-treat  analysis  set  (mITT)  will  include  all  patients  included  in  the  ITT 
population who received at least one complete dose of study medication 
The per-protocol analysis set (PP) will include all patients from the ITT analysis set who received 
randomised treatment according to their randomisation and the planned treatment schedule and 
did not have any major protocol violations 
A second Safety Population (Safety (Nellcor)) consisted of all patients in the Safety Population 
who had usable Nellcor data and were analyzed as treated. 
The primary efficacy analysis (success of the procedure using a composite endpoint) will be summarised 
descriptively. 
For the primary efficacy analysis, the following primary hypothesis will be tested: 
H0: πRemi ≤ πPLA vs. H1: πRemi > πPLA, 
where πRemi and πPLA denote the success rates for Remimazolam and placebo, respectively. The primary 
efficacy analysis will be the comparison of these success rates between the remimazolam and placebo 
groups, using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test to account for fentanyl use strata. The following 
three strata will be formed based on overall fentanyl dose: 
< 100 μg; 100 - 150 μg; >150 - 200 μg 
The primary efficacy analysis will be based on the ITT, mITT and PP populations, with the mITT and PP 
populations planned to confirm the results of the ITT population. 
The only imputed data was drowsiness scores that were imputed as 100 if the patient was too drowsy to 
complete the assessment. There was no other imputation of missing data.

Three randomised patients discontinued from the study without receiving any treatment: One patient was 
terminated early due to a Nellcor device error; one was terminated early as the investigator added an 
oesophagogastroduodenoscopy procedure; Another patient terminated early due to a protocol violation, 
having been included despite a known sensitivity to study drug(s).

Baseline data 
The mean (± SD) age of patients was 54.9 (10.05) years. The majority of patients were younger than 65 
years (395 [86.2%] patients). The study enrolled slightly more female patients than male (240 [52.4%] 
and 218 [47.6%], respectively), with a greater disparity observed in the placebo group (35 [58.3%] and 
25  [41.7%],  respectively)  than  in  the  other  treatment  groups.  Overall,  the  majority  of  patients  were 
either  white  (339  [74.0%]  patients)  or  black  (80  [17.5%]  patients).  Mean  height  and  weight  were 
comparable between treatment groups. The mean (± SD) BMI overall was 29.0 (4.81).

Regarding the primary efficacy endpoint results, conducted in the ITT population, treatment success was 
observed  in  272  (91.3%)  patients  in  the  remimazolam  group,  compared  to  1  (1.7%)  patient  in  the 
placebo group and 26 (25.2%) patients in midazolam group. The difference in treatment success rates 
between  remimazolam  and  placebo  is  0.8961  (95%  CI:  0.8505,  0.9416);  between  remimazolam  and 
midazolam 0.6603 (95% CI: 0.5705, 0.7501). 
Regarding  reasons  for  treatment  failure,  in  the  remimazolam  group,  18  of  the  26  treatment  failures 
received too many doses within the predefined time window, 10 required rescue sedative medications, 
and 7 did not complete the procedure. The most frequently reported reason for failure in the placebo 
group was use of rescue sedative medication (57 out of 59 patients), and 1 patient did not complete the 
procedure.  In  the  midazolam  group,  66  of  the  77  failures  received  rescue  sedative  medication,  56 
received too many doses in the predefined time window, and 2 did not complete the procedure. For all 
groups, more than 1 reason for treatment failure per patient was possible.

Ancillary analyses 
Sensitivity analyses 
Sensitivity  analysis  of  the  primary  efficacy  outcome  in  the  ITT  analysis  set  was  performed  using 
subgroups  based  on  the  amount  of  fentanyl  received.  Results  were  obtained  for  2  strata:  patients 
receiving <100 μg fentanyl, and patients receiving 100-150 μg fentanyl. Analysis for patients receiving 
>150 μg was not possible as too few patients received doses this high. Results were similar to those seen 
in the primary efficacy analysis. For the comparison between the remimazolam group and the placebo 
group in the <100 μg fentanyl stratum, the difference in rates was 0.9392 (95% CI: 0.9007, 0.9777), and 
was statistically significant; in the 100-150 μg fentanyl stratum, the difference in rates was 0.8877 (95% 
CI: 0.8232, 0.9522), and was statistically significant. Results for the comparison between remimazolam 
and midazolam were comparable to those seen in the primary efficacy analysis. 
Results  of  sensitivity  analysis  in  the  mITT  and  PP  analysis  sets  were  comparable  to  those  in  the  ITT 
analysis set. 
Subgroup analyses 
Subgroup analysis based on gender showed treatment success in a numerically higher proportion of male 
patients  (154  [70.3%]  patients)  than  female  patients  (145  [59.9%]  patients);  for  both  genders, 
differences between treatment groups were similar to those seen in the overall population. 
Subgroup  analysis  based  on  age  groups  (<65  years,  ≥65  years)  showed  similar  success  rates,  with 
success reported in 256 (64.3%) patients in the <65 years group and 43 (68.3%) patients in the ≥65 
years group overall; an imbalance in the size of the subgroups was observed, with 398 patients aged <65 
years, and 63 patients aged ≥65 years. In the remimazolam group, success rates were numerically higher 
in the patients aged ≥65 years than in those aged <65 years (100% and 89.9%, respectively); in the 
midazolam group however, the success rate was 28.1% in patients aged <65 years, compared to 7.1% in 
patients  aged  ≥65  years.  There  was  no  difference in  success  rate  between  age  groups  in  the  placebo 
group. 
In subgroup analysis based on ASA-PS score, treatment success was observed overall in 104 (72.7%) 
patients with an ASA-PS of I, in 173 (60.5%) patients with an ASA-PS of II, and in 22 (71.0%) patients 
with an ASA-PS of III. In the remimazolam group, the success rate was similar in patients with ASA-PS 
scores of I and III (94.7% and 95.7%, respectively) but lower in patients with an ASA-PS score of II 
(88.9%). In contrast, amongst patients treated with midazolam, a successive decrease in the success 
rate was observed from ASA-PS scores of I (37.8%), to II (19.7%), to III (0.0%).

Treatments and overall design 
This is a phase 3 prospective, double-blind, randomised, multi-centre, parallel-group trial assessing the 
efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), and safety of remimazolam compared to placebo in patients undergoing 
flexible bronchoscopy with an additional midazolam arm (open-label).  
All patients received 0.9% NaCl solution up to 1,000 mL drip starting prior to the procedure and 75 μg 
(later amended to 25 to 50 μg) of fentanyl immediately prior to the administration of the trial medication 
(with dose reductions at the investigator’s discretion for elderly and debilitated patients).  
Patients were randomised to receive an initial single iv dose over one minute of remimazolam 5.0 mg or 
an  equal  volume  of  placebo  in  a  blinded  manner,  and  bronchoscopy  started  when  adequate  sedation 
(MOAA/S ≤3) was achieved. 
Sedation could be maintained by injection of further doses of remimazolam 2.5 mg or placebo in the same 
volume not earlier than two minutes apart after assessment of the sedative effect. The overall number of 
remimazolam/placebo doses was not limited as long as not more than five doses were administered in 
any 15-minute window. If five doses within 15 minutes were not sufficient to obtain adequate sedation for 
the bronchoscopy, this was defined as a treatment failure. 
In  the  open-label  midazolam  arm,  the  drug  was  administered  according  to  existing  US  label 
recommendation following a requirement by the FDA. Healthy adults <60 years of age received 1.75 mg 
of  midazolam  as  an  initial  dose  over  two  minutes.  Adult  patients  ≥60  years  of  age,  debilitated  or 
chronically ill patients received 1.0 mg as an initial dose over two minutes. Sedation could be maintained 
by further doses of 1.0 mg in healthy adults <60 years; in the case of adults ≥60 years, debilitated, or 
chronically  ill  patients,  the  dose  was  0.5  mg.  These  subsequent  doses  were  titrated  slowly  and 
administered over at least two minutes. At least two or more additional minutes were allowed to fully 
evaluate the sedative effect. The overall number of midazolam doses was not limited as long as not more 
than three doses were administered in any 12-minute window. Should three doses within any 12-minute 
window  not  be  sufficient  to  obtain  adequate  sedation  for  the  bronchoscopy,  this  was  considered  a 
treatment failure. 
After determination of treatment failure, midazolam was defined as the only sedative rescue medication 
in such cases in order to perform or finalise the bronchoscopy, irrespective of the randomised treatment. 
The initial fentanyl dose was 75 μg, to be administered as an analgesic pretreatment immediately prior to 
administration of the initial dose of the trial medication. Top-up doses of fentanyl of 25 μg were allowed 
every 5-10 minutes until analgesia was adequate or the maximum dose of 200 μg per procedure had been 
given. The fentanyl dose for elderly and debilitated patients could be reduced at the discretion of the 
investigator consistent with labelling of fentanyl. Amendment 5.0 introduced a general reduction of initial 
fentanyl dose to 25 to 50 μg or a suitable reduced dose for elderly or debilitated patients.

• 
Randomisation 
Prior  to  dosing,  patients  were  randomly  assigned  in  a  30:6:6  ratio  to  remimazolam,  placebo  and 
open-label midazolam. The randomisation schedule was be computer-generated using a permuted block 
algorithm and randomly allocated study drug randomisation numbers. The randomisation numbers were 
be assigned sequentially as patients are entered into the study.  
Randomisation  will  be  stratified  by  age  group.  Study  site  will  not  be  stratified  in  the  randomisation 
schedule. Stratification for the amount of chronic opioids and/or benzodiazepines was not done.  
At Study Day 1, after confirming that a patient still meets entry criteria, study personnel will inform the 
pharmacist that the subject qualifies for randomisation. The unblinded pharmacist will call the central 
IWRS and enter the requested information. The IWRS will then assign the next randomisation number in 
the sequence and inform the pharmacist of the study treatment assignment. Thereafter, the pharmacist 
will dispense the corresponding treatment. 
• 
Blinding (masking) 
The  identity  of  the  blinded  study  drugs  (remimazolam  or  placebo)  will  not  be  revealed  to  study 
management or to anyone at the study site except for the pharmacist, the pharmacy staff and Premier’s 
unblinded monitor until the study is completed. This exemption also applies to the DMC members. The 
pharmacist and staff will not participate in other study procedures. Patients will be blinded to treatment.

drug and will be analyzed as treated

• 
The intent-to-treat analysis set (ITT) will include all patients who were randomised and will be 
analyzed as randomised 
The  modified  intent-to-treat  analysis  set  (mITT)  will  include  all  patients  included  in  the  ITT 
population who received at least one complete dose of study medication 
The per-protocol analysis set (PP) will include all patients from the ITT analysis set who received 
randomised treatment according to their randomisation and the planned treatment schedule and 
did not have any major protocol violations. 
The secondary safety populations consisted of all patients in the safety population who had usable 
Nellcor  data  (“usable”  was  defined  as  at  least  90%  of  readable  Nellcor  data  per  parameter 
available within the observation time, ie, the time from the first dose of trial medication until fully 
alert). 
The primary efficacy analysis (success of the procedure using a composite endpoint) will be summarised 
descriptively for overall success and within each category for treatment group. 
For the primary efficacy analysis, the following primary hypothesis will be tested: 
H0: πRemi ≤ πPLA vs. H1: πRemi > πPLA, 
where πRemi and πPLA denote the success rates for Remimazolam and placebo, respectively. The primary 
efficacy analysis will be the comparison of these success rates between the remimazolam and placebo 
groups,  using  the  Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel  (CMH)  test  to  account  for  fentanyl,  opioid  and 
benzodiazepine dose strata.  
The following three strata were formed based on overall fentanyl dose: <100 μg; 100 to 150 μg; >150 μg 
(initially specified as >150 to 200 μg in the Protocol v1.0, but it was updated in the SAP to account for the 
change in fentanyl dose according to Amendment 5). 
Comparisons  between  treatment  groups  will  be  performed  in  a  descriptive  manner  for  the  secondary 
efficacy endpoints. For the key secondary variables (variables 1 through 6), only the pairwise comparison 
between placebo and remimazolam was used for exploratory efficacy significance testing. 
Additional analyses 
Additional sensitivity analyses will be performed to assess the influence of opioids (including fentanyl) and 
benzodiazepines on sedation in the three treatment groups.  
Sensitivity analyses to assess the effect of the amount of fentanyl given during the study, chronic opioid 
dose, and chronic benzodiazepine dose (including fentanyl) and benzodiazepines will be performed on 
variables 1-9. They will be performed by including the doses of the medication as additional factors. For 
analyses the amount of fentanyl given during the study, chronic opioid dose, and chronic benzodiazepine 
dose will be formed. The analysis will then be changed to a stratified log rank test (variables 1-6) or a 
logistic regression (variable 8), while opioid (including fentanyl) and benzodiazepine strata will be added 
as an additional factor for the ANOVA for variables 5, 7 and 9. 
Regarding subgroup analyses, the secondary efficacy endpoints were additionally analyzed by gender, 
age group, ASA-PS status, and rescue medication taken (yes/no).

The median time to the start of the procedure from the first dose of randomised trial medication was 
shorter  in  remimazolam  group  (4.1  minutes  [95%-CI:  4.0,  4.8])  than  in  the  placebo  and  midazolam 
groups (17.0 minutes [95%-CI: 16.0, 17.5] and 15.5 minutes [95%-CI: 13.8, 16.7], respectively). In the 
comparison of remimazolam versus placebo, the corresponding hazard ratio was 2.936 (95%-CI: 2.202, 
3.914) and was statistically significant (P <0.0001). The corresponding hazard ratio for the comparison of 
remimazolam versus midazolam was 2.869 (95%-CI: 2.183, 3.772). 
The  time  to  peak  sedation  after  administration  of  the  first  dose  of  randomised  trial  medication  was 
analysed using the first of the lowest MOAA/S scores <4 after the initial dose before any top-up. The 
median time to peak sedation was shorter in the remimazolam group (3.5 minutes [95%- CI: 3.5, 4.0]) 
than  in  the  midazolam  group  (7.0  minutes  [95%-CI:  7.0,  -]).  No  data  for  the  placebo  group  were 
available since peak sedation (MOAAS ≤3) prior to the first top-up/rescue was only reached for 1 patient 
(1.6%)  in  the  placebo  group  compared  to  the  majority  of  patients  in  the  remimazolam  group  (180 
patients [58.1%]) and 7 patients (9.6%) in the midazolam group.

Ancillary analyses 
Sensitivity analyses 
Sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy outcome were performed to assess the influence of opioids 
(including fentanyl) and benzodiazepines on the sedation in the three treatment groups. 
In all three fentanyl strata (<100 μg, 100-150 μg, and >150 μg), statistically significant differences in 
success rates in the comparison remimazolam versus placebo were shown (<100 μg: 0.8699 [95%-CI: 
0.7888,  0.9511],  P  <0.0001;  100-150  μg:  0.6667  [95%-CI:  0.4889,  0.8445],  P  <0.0001;  >150  μg: 
0.2400 [95%-CI: 0.0726, 0.4074] P = 0.0421). Also, statistically significant differences were shown in 
analyses conducted in strata based on the patients’ initial fentanyl dose (ie. 25 - <50 μg; 50 - <75 μg; 
≥75 μg). In the sensitivity analysis by chronic opioid use, the differences in success rates between the 
remimazolam and placebo groups were also statistically significant. 
Furthermore,  a  sensitivity  analysis  was  conducted  by  chronic  benzodiazepine  use,  which  also  showed 
statistically significant differences in rates between the remimazolam and placebo groups (yes: 0.6327 
[95%-CI: 0.4977, 0.7676], P = 0.0010, no: 0.7845 [95%-CI: 0.7098, 0.8593], P <0.0001). 
Results for the comparison between remimazolam and midazolam were comparable to those seen in the 
primary efficacy analysis, except that the difference in success rates was smaller for the initial fentanyl 
stratum ≥75 μg (0.0067 [95%-CI: -0.3244, 0.3377]).

Results  of  sensitivity  analysis  in  the  mITT  and  PP  analysis  sets  were  comparable  to  those  in  the  ITT 
analysis set, except that the difference in success rates between the remimazolam and placebo groups 
was not statistically significant for the fentanyl stratum >150 μg in the PP population (0.3333 [95%-CI: 
-0.2001, 0.8668], P = 0.4142). 
Sensitivity analyses were performed for several secondary outcomes. The median times to the start of the 
procedure were similar when analyzed in subgroups based on total fentanyl use, and chronic opioid use. 
The  median  time  for  the  patients  in  the  subgroup  with  chronic  benzodiazepine  use  was  6.6  minutes 
(95%-CI: 4.4, 9.7) and was slightly higher than the median time for those patients who had no chronic 
benzodiazepine use (4.0 minutes [95%-CI: 4.0, 4.6]). 
Regarding time to peak sedation, sensitivity analyses results were similar to those of the main analysis 
when analyzed in subgroups based on total fentanyl use, chronic opioid use, and chronic benzodiazepine 
use. 
Based  on  the  total  fentanyl  use,  the  median  time  to  ready  for  discharge  after  bronchoscope  out  was 
slightly higher for the patients with >150 μg (5.0 minutes [95%-CI: -, -] than for the patients with <100 
μg (3.5 minutes [95%-CI: 3.4, 3.8]) and those with 100-150 μg (4.0 minutes [95%-CI: 3.0, -]). The 
results for the analysis conducted in subgroups based on chronic opioid use, and chronic benzodiazepine 
use were similar to those of the main analysis. 
Regarding time to fully alert after bronchoscope out, in the fentanyl stratum 100-150 μg, the median time 
to  fully  alert  in  the  remimazolam  group  was  13.6  minutes  (95%-CI:  8.0,  24.0),  higher  than  in  the 
midazolam group (12.0 minutes [95%-CI: 2.5, 23.8]) and lower than in the placebo group (15.0 minutes 
[95%-CI: 6.0, 35.4]). In the stratum >150 μg, the median time was higher in the remimazolam group 
(37.9 minutes [95%-CI: 6.0, 52.0]) than in the placebo and midazolam groups (30.0 minutes [95%-CI: 
2.5, 39.8] and 18.0 minutes [95%-CI: 7.0, 32.0], respectively). 
Regarding time to fully alert after the last injection of sedative drug, in the fentanyl stratum 100-150 μg, 
the median time to fully alert in the remimazolam group was 18.5 minutes (95%-CI: 15.0, 30.4) and was 
similar in the midazolam group (18.8 minutes [95%-CI: 9.0, 28.8]) and the placebo group (20.0 minutes 
[95%-CI: 10.3, 44.4]). In the stratum >150 μg, the median time was higher in the remimazolam group 
(44.2 minutes [95%-CI: 14.0, 66.0]) than in the placebo and midazolam groups (33.0 minutes [95%-CI: 
18.0, 48.0] and 33.0 minutes [95%-CI: 16.0, 42.0], respectively).  
Subgroup analyses 
Regarding  the  primary  outcome,  results  similar  to  those  of  the  primary  analysis  were  shown  for  the 
subgroups  based  on  gender,  age  group,  ASA-PS  status,  and  chronic  opioid  use.  In  the  subgroup  of 
patients with chronic benzodiazepine use, a success was reported for 31 patients (63.3%) compared with 
a success for 219 patients (83.9%) in the subgroup with no chronic benzodiazepine use. 
Regarding  rime  to  ready  for  discharge  after  bronchoscope  out,  results  similar  to  those  of  the  main 
analysis were shown for the analyses by gender and age group. Patients with an ASA-PS status of I had 
higher median times, but these subgroup consisted only of low numbers of patients. In the subgroup of 
patients who did not take any rescue medication, the median values were similar in the remimazolam and 
midazolam groups (59.0 minutes [95%-CI: 56.0, 61.0] and 58.5 minutes [95%-CI: 50.0, 64.0]) and 
slightly higher in the placebo group, which only consisted of 3 patients (72.5 minutes [95%-CI: 65.0, 
80.0]).

The  main  focus  was  the  pooled  data  analysis  of  the  Phase  3  trials  (analysis  of  two  Phase  3  trials 
CNS7056-006 and CNS7056-008 (Group A) to compare: 
•  Success rate remimazolam vs placebo (before rescue midazolam).  
•  Success rate remimazolam vs midazolam (open label midazolam dosing per USPI). 
•  Onset time to event endpoints remimazolam vs midazolam (midazolam dosing per USPI).  
•  Recovery  time  to  event  endpoints  remimazolam  vs  placebo  (midazolam  dosing  per  common 
medical practice).

Clinical studies in special populations 
There were no dedicated clinical studies focusing on efficacy in children or elderly patients. Clinical trial 
CNS7056-012 examined PK parameters of remimazolam in subjects with end stage renal disease. Clinical 
trial ONO-2745IVU007 examined the PK and PD parameters of remimazolam in subjects with moderate 
and severe hepatic impairment.  
The applicant summarised and discussed efficacy across age strata for patients included in the main trials 
in order to support that the benefit-risk among these patients is positive.

Treatments and overall design 
Study  015  was  a  prospective,  double-blind,  randomised,  placebo  and  active  controlled,  multicentre, 
parallel group phase 3 study comparing remimazolam to placebo, with an additional open-label arm for 
midazolam,  in  American  Society  of  Anesthesiologists  (ASA)  grade  III/IV  patients  undergoing  a 
colonoscopy for diagnostic or therapeutic reasons. 
Assessment report  
EMA/160756/2021  
Page 76/132 
 
 
 
Patients were randomised into one of 3 groups: remimazolam, placebo (double-blind) and midazolam 
(open label). 
Table 20: Study 015 Treatments (source: CSR) 
IP  formulation:  Remimazolam  will  be  presented  as  a  lyophilised  powder  in  a  10  mL  vial,  each  vial 
containing 20 mg remimazolam, which will be reconstituted with sterile 0.9% NaCl solution to yield a 2.5 
mg/mL solution for injection. 
Sedation initiation: 
• 
• 
Remimazolam or placebo group: After the initial dose, further doses may be applied at least two 
minutes apart, until adequate sedation is achieved. 
Midazolam group: After the initial dose, further doses may be applied at least two minutes apart, 
until adequate sedation is achieved. 
When  adequate  sedation  for  scope  insertion  has  been  achieved  (MOAA/S  ≤3)  a  colonoscope  will  be 
inserted and the procedure will be performed according to the usual clinical practice. 
Sedation maintenance: 
• 
• 
Remimazolam or placebo group: Subsequent doses of study drug will be administered over 15 
seconds, at least 2 minutes apart, to maintain the sedation (MOAA/S ≤4) as needed. The total 
number of doses of study drug throughout the procedure is not limited, as long as no more than 
5 doses are administered within any 15-minute window. 
Midazolam group: Subsequent doses will be administered over two minutes, at least two minutes 
apart, to maintain the sedation (MOAA/S ≤4) as needed. The total number of doses of midazolam 
throughout the procedure is not limited, as long as no more than 3 doses are administered within 
any 12-minute window. 
Pre-treatment and rescue analgesia: Fentanyl will be administered as an analgesic pre-treatment at a 
maximum dose of 50 μg (with suitable dose reductions for debilitated patients according to the discretion 
of  the  investigator),  immediately  prior  to  administration  of  the  initial  dose  of  the  study  medication. 
Top-up doses of 25 μg fentanyl q 5-10 minutes are allowed until analgesia is adequate or a maximum 
dose of 200 μg per procedure has been given.  
Rescue  sedation:  After  determination  of  treatment  failure,  only  midazolam  may  be  administered  as 
rescue sedation, according to local practice, in order to perform the colonoscopy.  
• 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint (composite): 
• 
• 
• 
Completion of the colonoscopy procedure, AND 
No requirement for a rescue sedative medication, AND 
No  requirement  of  more  than  5  doses  of  trial  medication  within  any  15-minute  window.  For 
midazolam only: no requirement of more than 3 doses within any 12-minute window.

Secondary efficacy endpoints: 
1) Amount of fentanyl used. 2) The time to start of procedure after administration of the first dose of trial 
medication.  3)  The  time  to  peak  sedation  after  administration  of  the  first  dose  of  randomised  trial 
medication.  4)  The  time  to  fully  alert  (time  to  first  of  three  MOAA/S  scores  of  5):  after  the  end  of 
colonoscopy procedure (colonoscope out) and after the last injection of randomised trial drug. 5) The 
MOAA/S scores by time point (at every time point up to 20 minutes post-dose, and thereafter as the last 
recorded score in each 5-minute time interval). 6) The recall of the procedure by the Brice questionnaire 
administered when full alertness was regained and on Day 4. 7) The drowsiness VAS 8) The requirement 
for flumazenil during the procedure (yes or no). 9) The investigator’s satisfaction with the sedation agent 
(assessed using an NRS).

potentially related to abuse; Concomitant medication; Clinical laboratory test results; Vital signs; Pulse 
oximetry  measurements;  Transcutaneous  pCO2  measurements;  12-lead  and  3-lead  ECG  findings; 
Physical  examination  finding;  Pain  on  injection  intensity  rating  using  VAS;  Airway  interventions; 
Administration of additional fluids or medication or any interventions necessary due to a clinically relevant 
change in ECG; Withdrawals due to the need for endotracheal intubation or the use of catecholamines;

PK endpoints (are to be described in separate PK analysis plan). 
• 
Randomisation 
Before  dosing,  patients  will  be  randomly  assigned  in  a  2:1:2  ratio  to  remimazolam,  placebo,  and 
open-label midazolam. A minimisation algorithm will be used for randomisation. This takes account of age 
group  (<  65  years,  65–74  years,  and  ≥  75  years)  and  ASA  status  (grade  III  or  IV),  and  adjusts  the 
probabilities of randomisation for each new patient based on the characteristics of that patient, to ensure 
that randomisation is balanced for both age and ASA status. The unblinded pharmacist will call the central 
interactive web response system (IWRS) and enter the requested information. The IWRS will then assign 
the  next  randomisation  number  in  the  sequence  and  inform  the  pharmacist  of  the  study  treatment 
assignment. Thereafter, the pharmacist will dispense the corresponding treatment. 
Randomisation will be stratified by age group and ASA status. The aim is to have an approximately equal 
distribution between ASA status III and IV patients on remimazolam. 
Study site will not be stratified in the randomisation schedule. Also, although foreseen for the primary 
analysis,  patients  will  not be  stratified  for  fentanyl  use  in  the  randomisation  as  the  need  for  fentanyl 
dosing cannot be determined beforehand. 
• 
Blinding (masking) 
All  patients,  investigators,  and  study  personnel  involved  in  the  conduct  of  the  study,  including  data 
management, were to be blinded to treatment assignment in the 2 double-blind arms. The midazolam 
arm is open label. 
In order to maintain the study blind, drug preparation for remimazolam and placebo was to be performed 
by an unblinded pharmacist at each site, and the final material provided to the investigational staff in a 
blinded manner. 
DMC was involved for monitoring of safety. DMC members had access to unblinded data.

Analysis populations 
• The  ITT  analysis  set  included  all  patients  who  were  randomised  and  were  analysed  as 
randomised. 
• The mITT analysis set included all patients included in the ITT analysis set who received at least 
1 complete dose of randomised trial medication.  
• The PP analysis set included all patients from the ITT analysis set who: received randomised 
treatment according to their randomisation and the planned treatment schedule and did not 
have any major protocol deviations. 
• The Safety population consisted of all randomised patients who received any amount of trial 
drug and were analysed as treated. 
• Secondary safety populations consisted of all patients in the Safety population who had usable 
Nellcor data and were analysed as treated. 
The  primary  efficacy  analysis  (success  of  the  procedure  using  the  composite  endpoint)  will  be 
summarised descriptively for overall success for each treatment group, with summaries to include the 
number and percentage of patients. No inferential statistical tests will be done. 
For  the  continuous  variables  (amount  of  fentanyl  used,  Brice  questionnaire,  drowsiness  VAS,  and 
investigator satisfaction), pairwise comparisons at each time point using analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
models with treatment as the main effect will be done. Pairwise comparisons will be done between the 
midazolam and remimazolam group and between the placebo and remimazolam groups, and the 95% CI 
of  the  difference  presented.  Those  CIs  will  be  interpreted  in  an  exploratory  sense  only;  no  formal 
hypotheses will be tested. 
Subgroup analyses (on primary efficacy endpoint) 
To investigate the effect of fentanyl on sedation, the success of the procedure will be summarised by 
subgroups of fentanyl use (<100 μg, 100-150 μg, >150-200 μg, >200 μg). If some of those subgroups 
have only few patients, then some of those categories may be combined for analysis. A decision about 
which subgroups will be included in the analysis will be made at the blinded data review meeting. 
The success of the procedure will be summarised by subgroups of ASA status (ASA grade III and IV).

Participant flow  
Table 21: Trial Populations (Study 015) 
Table 22: Participant Disposition (Study 015, Safety population) 
Protocol deviations led to exclusion from the PP analysis set. Major protocol deviations were reported in 
21  patients  (27.3%)  in  the  Safety  population.  The  most  frequently  observed  major  deviation  was 
incorrect IMP dosing, observed in 19 patients (24.7%) overall; this was observed in more patients in the 
remimazolam group. These errors included administration of top-up doses when sedation was adequate 
(MOAA/S of 3 or less), inadequate windows between two doses (less than 2 minutes), and inadequate 
dose administration time. A complete listing of all reported protocol deviations (major and minor), by 
patient, is provided in the submitted dossier. 
• 
Baseline data 
The  applicant  presented  tabulated  baseline  characteristics  for  each  group  and  average  numbers.  The 
mean age was 62 years overall, and was comparable between the 3 treatment groups; the trial included 
more patients under the age of 65 (46 patients, 59.7%) than patients who were aged ≥65 years (31 
patients, 40.3%), with no imbalance observed between treatment groups. The trial enrolled more male 
patients than female patients (55.8% versus 44.2% overall), with a greater imbalance observed in the

placebo groups (75.0% versus 25.0%) than in the other treatment groups; in the midazolam group, there 
were more female patients than male patients (53.3% versus 46.7%). Overall, the majority of patients 
were  either  white  (57  patients,  74.0%)  or  black/African  American  (19  patients,  24.7%);  a  greater 
proportion of black/African American patients was observed in the midazolam group (33.3%) than in the 
remimazolam group (19.4%) or the placebo group (18.8%). The mean height was comparable between 
treatment groups. Mean weight was also comparable between groups, and was higher than might be 
considered normal, with a mean weight of 91.0 kg in the remimazolam group, 94.0 kg in the placebo 
group, and 87.9 kg in the midazolam group. The mean BMI overall was 30.8 kg/m2, with no difference 
observed between treatment groups. 
Table 23: ASA-PS Score Assessment (Study 015, Safety population) 
Details of medical and surgical history were summarised by treatment group. At the SOC level, the most 
frequently reported medical history was in vascular disorders (70 patients, 90.9%), surgical and medical 
procedures (68 patients, 88.3%), metabolism and nutrition disorders (67 patients, 87.0%), GI disorders 
(64  patients,  83.1%),  respiratory,  thoracic,  and  mediastinal  disorders  (57  patients,  74.0%),  cardiac 
disorders (51 patients, 66.2%), musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (51 patients, 66.2%), 
and psychiatric disorders (50 patients, 64.9%). 
• 
Outcomes and estimation 
In the primary efficacy analysis, conducted in the ITT analysis set, the majority of patients (27 patients, 
84.4%)  in  the  remimazolam  group  met  the  criteria  for  successful  completion  of  the  procedure;  in 
comparison,  no  patients  in  the  placebo  group  (0  patients,  0.0%)  and  few  the  midazolam  group  (4 
patients, 12.9%) completed the procedure successfully. For the 5 patients (15.6%) in the remimazolam 
group who failed to complete the procedure in accordance with the definition of success, the reasons for 
failure included the use of rescue sedative medication (3 patients, 9.4%), too many doses being used 
within the pre-defined time window (3 patients, 9.4%), and failure to complete the procedure (1 patient, 
3.1%; this was Patient 3005 who was withdrawn without being treated).  
Use  of  rescue  sedative  medication  and  use  of  rescue  sedative  medication  were  the  most  frequently 
reported reasons for failure in all 3 treatment groups, each reported in 43 patients (54.4%) overall. As 
might be expected, the use of rescue medication was reported in all patients in the placebo group (16 
patients,  100.0%).  Amongst  27  patients  (87.1%)  in  the  midazolam  treatment  group  who  failed,  24 
patients (77.4%) failed due to the use of rescue medication; furthermore, 26 (83.9%) of these patients 
received too many doses of the IMP within the predefined window, which was also considered a reason for 
failure. More than 1 reason for failure was possible.

Table 24: Primary Efficacy Results – Success of the Procedure (Study 015, ITT population) 
Secondary efficacy results 
The mean fentanyl dose (total) was numerically lower in the remimazolam group (59.7 μg) than in the 
placebo group (67.2 μg) or the midazolam group (66.7 μg). The median time to start of procedure was 
numerically lower in the remimazolam group than in the placebo or midazolam groups. The median time 
to peak sedation was 3.0 min in the remimazolam group but could not be estimated in the placebo or 
midazolam groups as more than half the subjects in the analysis were censored, having failed to reach a 
MOAA/S of 3 before the first supplemental dose of either randomised study medication or fentanyl. Both 
times to fully alert from the end of the colonoscopy and from the last dose of study medication or rescue 
sedative were shorter in the remimazolam group than in the placebo or midazolam group.

Table 25: Time to Event Secondary Efficacy Endpoints (Study 015, mITT population) 
Evaluation  of  recall  of  the  procedure  using  the  Brice  questionnaire  showed  no  clinically  relevant 
differences  between  treatment  groups  in  terms  of  recall  of  the  procedure,  their  satisfaction  with  the 
sedation,  or  the  incidence  of  unwanted  effects  on  the  day  after  the  procedure.  Analysis  of  the 
investigators’ assessment of satisfaction showed that mean satisfaction scores were comparable in the 
remimazolam group (9.1) and the midazolam group (9.4), but were numerically lower in the placebo 
group (7.5). All other secondary efficacy endpoints are also analysed and presented in the CSR. 
• 
Ancillary analyses 
Efficacy  analyses  included  subgroup  analyses  according  to  fentanyl  dose  (<100  μg,  100-150  μg, 
>150-200 μg, >200 μg) and ASA status. Some additional analyses are mentioned in the CSP, but are 
regarded as not classified correctly. 
Results were obtained for 2 fentanyl strata: patients receiving <100 μg fentanyl and patients receiving 
100-150 μg fentanyl; an additional planned stratum for patients receiving >150-200 μg fentanyl included 
1 patient (midazolam group), while a planned stratum for patients receiving>200 μg fentanyl did not 
include any patients. According to the CSR, a comparisons between the <100 μg fentanyl subgroup and 
the 100-150 μg fentanyl subgroup are difficult to interpret because of a disparity in the size of the 2 
subgroups; the majority of patients (68/79 patients) received <100 μg fentanyl (29/32, 12/16 and 27/31 
patients in remimazolam, placebo and midazolam group respecitely). The incidence of procedural success 
in this subgroup was largely comparable to that seen in the primary analysis, with success reported in 
86.2% of the remimazolam group vs 0.0% and 14.8% of placebo and midazolam group respectively. 
Amongst 8 patients included in the 100-150 μg subgroup, 2 patients in the remimazolam group achieved 
success,  while  all  4  patients  in  the  placebo  group  and  2  patients  in  the  midazolam  group  failed  to 
successfully complete the procedure. 
The 27 patients in the remimazolam group who successfully completed the procedure were distributed 
evenly between the ASA-PS grade III subgroup (13 patients) and the ASA-PS  grade IV subgroup (14 
patients). Amongst 4 patients in the midazolam group who successfully completed the procedure, 3 had 
ASA-PS grade IV, while 1 had ASA-PS grade III. All patients in the placebo group failed to complete the 
procedure successfully. 
Subgroup analysis showed little effect of fentanyl dose or ASA-PS on the success rate in remimazolam 
treated subjects.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The clinical programme included several phase 2 and phase 3 procedures requiring sedation, with and 
without  analgesia  with  fentanyl.  Studies  were  mostly  carried  against  placebo,  with  midazolam  as  an 
active comparator or rescue medication in most studies. This approach is acceptable. 
The endpoint “success of the procedure” with the operational criteria was pragmatic and is considered 
adequate for registration purposes. 
The choice of midazolam over propofol, the other possible alternative for procedural sedation / analgesia 
is  understood,  given  the  similarity  of  remimazolam  to  midazolam,  and  the  approach  to  target  the 
practitioner as the sedating personnel and not an anaesthetist.  
Uncertainties were raised regarding the capability of the practitioner to perform both sedation and control 
the  depth  of  sedation  and  perform  the  diagnostic  procedure  in  the  same  timeframe  as  it  would  be 
performed with both practitioner and anaesthetist.  
Also uncertain was the superiority in efficacy as compared to midazolam. Midazolam was underdosed in 
the  trials  where  it  was  an  active  comparator,  as  the  USPI  (also  similar  to  the  proposed  dosing  of 
midazolam EU SmPC) recommend doses which are clearly below commonly used doses. 
All  5  main  trials  were  conducted  in  the  US.  The  applicant  has  provided  a  discussion  regarding 
extrapolation to  EU  population  taking  into  consideration  differences  regarding  standard of  care  in  the 
clinical setting, the use of fentanyl and midazolam between the US and EU and procedural dissimilarities.  
The applicant explained who assessed the completion of the endoscopic procedure. Although the identity 
of the person assessing the completeness of the endoscopic procedure was not captured in the eCRF, the 
PI took ultimate responsibility for the correctness of all trial data. The number and relative frequency of 
incomplete procedures was very small (9 incompleted procedures out of 966 patients treated; i.e. 0.9%) 
and this is reassuring. It can be assumed that having an independent assessment would not significantly 
influence the results.  
Phase 2 studies CNS7056-003  and  CNS7056-004  are evaluated as dose response studies, Phase 3 
studies  CNS7056-006  and  CNS7056-008  are evaluated as main pivotal confirmatory studies while 
Phase 3 study CNS7056-015 in ASA III/IV patients is evaluated as a supportive study. 
Study CNS7056-003 was a Phase 2a, dose-finding study evaluating the safety and efficacy of CNS 7056 
(ie.remimazolam)  compared  to  midazolam  in  patients  undergoing  diagnostic  upper  GI  endoscopy. 
Patients were randomised to receive 1 of the 4 treatments: remimazolam 0.10 mg/kg, 0.15 mg/kg, or 
0.20 mg/kg; or midazolam 0.075 mg/kg, delivered as a single IV injection over 1 minute. Rescue with 
midazolam  was  allowed  as  at  the  discretion  of  the  administering  physician.  This  is  the  only  study  in 
procedural sedation that was performed withought concomitant use of fentanyl for analgesia. This is also 
the only study where dosing of remimazolam was done according to body weight, and top-up doses of 
remimazolam/midazolam were not used. In phase 3 studies the applicant decided to proceed with a fixed 
dose of 5mg remimazolam (which is lower than the doses used in this study) plus top-up doses consisting 
of  2.5mg  remimazolam.  The  dose  of  midazolam  in  this  study  is  too  high  compared  to  EU  midazolam 
(adults  <60  y:  initial  dose  2-2.5  mg).  In  this  study  the  dose  of  midazolam  was  0.075  mg/kg,  which 
corresponds to 5.25mg for an adult weighing 70kg. 
Study CNS7056-004 was a Phase 2b study evaluating the safety and efficacy of multiple doses of CNS 
7056  (i.e.  remimazolam)  compared  to  midazolam  in  patients  undergoing  colonoscopy.  Patients  were 
randomised to receive 1 of the 4 treatments: remimazolam 8mg initial dose+3mg top-ups; remimazolam 
Assessment report  
EMA/160756/2021  
Page 84/132 
 
 
 
7mg initial+2mg top-ups; remimazolam 5mg initial+3mg top-ups; or the comparator midazolam 2.5mg 
initial+1mg top-ups. As rescue medications, several drugs were allowed, which is different from other 
procedural sedation studies where only midazolam rescue was allowed. Fentanyl was administered for 
analgesia (100 μg initially with top-ups allowed). 
Study CNS7056-006 was a phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of remimazolam compared 
to double-blind placebo and open-label midazolam in patients undergoing colonoscopy. Participants were 
randomised to receive one of the following 3 treatments: remimazolam 5mg initial dose+2.5mg top-ups; 
matching  placebo  or  midazolam  1.75mg  initial  dose+1mg  top-ups  (for  adults  ≥60  years  of 
age/debilitated/chronically  ill  initial  dose  of  midazolam  was  reduced  to  1mg  and  top-up  doses  were 
reduced to 0.5mg). The number of supplemental doses of study drug was not limited; however, more 
than 5 doses (including the initial dose) within any 15-min period for remimazolam/placebo or more than 
3 doses (including the initial dose) within any 12-min period for midazolam were considered treatment 
failure.  In  these  cases,  participants  received  rescue midazolam  dosed  at  the  investigator’s  discretion. 
Fentanyl  was  administered  for  analgesia  (initially  75μg,  reduced  to  50μg  in  protocol  amendment  4; 
top-ups were allowed). The initial dose of midazolam is slightly lower than EU midazolam. The ITT set was 
used for the primary efficacy analysis and consisted of all randomised patients: 298 in remimazolam; 60 
in placebo and 103 in midazolam arms. The ITT set (all randomised) and safety set (received any amount 
of study drug) differ by 3 patients, who were excluded prior to receiving any treatment and their exclusion 
was unlikely to introduce bias. 
Study CNS7056-008 was a phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of remimazolam compared 
to double-blind placebo and open-label midazolam in patients undergoing bronchoscopy. Patients were 
randomised to receive remimazolam, placebo or midazolam in the same doses as in study 006. The same 
criteria was used for declaring treatment failure and rescue sedative was also midazolam. Fentanyl was 
administered for analgesia (initially 75 μg, later amended to 25 to 50 μg; top-ups were allowed). The ITT 
set  was  used  for  the  primary  efficacy  analysis  and  consisted  of  all  randomised  patients:  310  in 
remimazolam, 63 in placebo and 73 in midazolam. The ITT set and safety set differ by 7, 3 and 5 patients 
in remimazolam, placebo and midazolam arm, respectively. Details concerning 15 patients excluded after 
randomisation as well as details on missing information were provided upon request and indeed protocol 
deviations for the ITT population stratified by treatment arm are considered balanced. 
Study CNS7056-015 was a phase 3 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of remimazolam compared 
to double-blind placebo and open-label midazolam in ASA III and IV patients undergoing colonoscopy.  
Dosing is based on phase 2 trials. However, none of the two phase 2 trials can entirely justify the dose 
initially  proposed  for  marketing,  since  remimazolam  doses  were  higher  than  the  ones  intended  for 
marketing. Even the lowest dose in phase 2 trials, 5 mg initial + 3 mg top-ups (Study 004) does not 
correspond totally to the dose intended for marketing (5 mg initial + 2.5 mg top-ups, reduced for elderly). 
The applicant has reasoned that the 5mg bolus dose and 2.5 mg top up doses have been used in phase 3 
trials and show the best B-R. The modelling of the 4 mg has shown interesting results since light and 
moderate sedation (58%) were comparable to the 5 mg (47%) with less (possibly 7%) deep sedation and 
only 4% more of non-responders. The top-up dose, being slightly smaller than the phase II studied dose 
is not debatable. Patient population is adequately selected and represents the target colonoscopy and 
bronchoscopy population. Study 015 included only patients with ASA grade III/IV, ie. patients with severe 
systemic disease (ASA III) and patients with severe systemic disease that is a constant threat to life (ASA 
IV).  No  imbalances  regarding  distribution  of  ASA  grades  was  observed  in  study  015.  Imbalances  in 
distribution of ASA grades per treatment arm were noted in studies 006 and 008. Patients allocated to 
placebo  tended  to  have  higher  ASA  grades  (26.8%  ASA  III)  than  patients  allocated  to  remimazolam 
(21.7%) and midazolam (17.0%).

Procedures selected for the broad indication of procedural sedation are colonoscopy and bronchoscopy 
(study 003 was a phase 2 trial in upper GI endoscopy but it is not considered pivotal since (too) high doses 
of  both  midazolam  and  remimazolam  were  used).  According  to  the  applicant,  colonoscopies  and 
bronchoscopies  are  listed  among  the  top  10  surgical  operations  and  procedures  in  the  EU.  This  is 
acknowledged.  Initially  planned  study  CNS7056-007  was  not  conducted  but  substituted  by  the 
bronchoscopy trial (CNS7056-008). 
Procedural sedation may be used for any procedure in which a patient's pain or anxiety is pronounced and 
may  interfere  with  performance.  This  includes  a  variety  of  procedures  of  different  duration,  level  of 
invasiveness and urgency. Due to its rapid onset of action and a favourable recovery profile, it can be 
expected that remimazolam will be of interest for procedures performed in emergency departments, such 
as closed reductions of dislocated joints, complicated laceration repair, diagnostic CT imaging and many 
other. Cardiac patients who at higher risk of sedation complications may also require procedural sedation 
for  procedures  such  as  left  heart  catheterisation  or  coronary  stenting,  electrical  cardioversion  and 
implantation  of 
internal  defibrillators,  pacemakers  or 
trans-femoral  aortic  valves.  These 
patients/procedures were not evaluated during the procedural sedation programme of remimazolam.  
The applicant discussed the generalisability of procedural sedation during colonoscopy and bronchoscopy 
to other procedures during which sedation may be required. In Studies CNS7056-006 and CNS7056-008, 
577 out of 608 procedures lasted for less than 30 minutes amounting to almost 95% of all procedures. 
Only  31  out  of  608  procedures  lasted  longer  than  (or  equal  to)  30  minutes  amounting  to  5%  of  all 
procedures. The numbers of patients with procedures lasting ≥30 minutes are very small, precluding firm 
conclusions on efficacy in this longer duration group. Numerically less successful procedures are observed 
with longer duration procedures for patients receiving remimazolam compared to shorter procedures. On 
the contrary, the proportion of successful procedures with midazolam stayed unchanged regardless of the 
duration  of  procedure.  Proportion  of  successful  procedures  with  placebo  (real-life  midazolam)  even 
increased with longer procedures. However, proportion of success of procedures in procedures lasting 
≥30 minutes is still higher in remimazolam compared to midazolam and placebo (real-life midazolam) 
groups. The frequencies of TEAEs in virtually all SOCs is higher in procedures lasting for ≥30 minutes 
compared  to  procedures  lasting  for  less  than  30  minutes.  It  is  acknowledged  that  the  numbers  of 
procedures in the longer duration group are very small hampering meaningful comparisons. However, the 
same  trend  is  apparent  across  all  treatment  groups  (midazolam,  remimazolam  and  placebo).  The 
applicant’s rationale of longer observation time allowing for more TEAEs to be collected is a reasonable 
explanation  for  this  observation.  The  applicant  was  asked  to  update  section  5.1  of  the  SmPC  with 
information regarding main efficacy, safety and recovery data for procedures lasting less than 30 minutes 
compared  to  those  lasting  for  ≥30  minutes  in  trials  006  and  008  in  order  to  clearly  informed  the 
prescribers  that  in  longer  procedures  recovery  time  with  remimazolam  was  prolonged  compared  to 
midazolam. 
The comparator for the 3 phase 3 studies was double-blind placebo and open-label midazolam. Initial 
dose of midazolam in studies 006 and 008 (1.75mg) is somewhat lower than the initial dose for indication 
conscious sedation for EU midazolam (2-2.5mg), while in study 003 the initial dose of midazolam is too 
high (0.075 mg/kg, corresponding to 5.25mg for an adult weighing 70kg). Studies 004 and 015 utilised 
midazolam  dose  in  accordance  with  EU  SmPC.  Placebo  as  comparator  is  acceptable  since  rescue 
midazolam was allowed after failure of placebo. The majority of patients allocated to placebo were treated 
with midazolam according to investigators clinical practice. 
Endpoints were similar for all 5 procedural sedation studies – primary endpoint for all studies (except 
study 015) was a composite endpoint evaluating the success of procedure. The main secondary endpoints 
were  time-to-event  endpoints  that  evaluated  the  onset  (time  to  start  of  procedure  and  time  to  peak 
sedation) and recovery (time to fully alert, time to ready for discharge, time to back to normal) profile of

remimazolam. The primary outcome of study 015 was safety in ASA III/IV populations, but the efficacy 
outcomes were the same as for other procedural sedation studies.  
The primary efficacy endpoint (success of procedure) is defined as follows: 
For Studies 003 and 004: ALL of the following: a) MOAA/S ≤4 on 3 consecutive measurements, 
AND  b)  Completion  of  the  endoscopy  procedure,  AND  c)  No  requirement  for  rescue  sedative 
medication, AND d) No manual or mechanical ventilation. 
For  Studies  006,  008  and  015:  ALL  of 
the 
following:  a)  Completion  of 
the 
colonoscopy/bronchoscopy  procedure,  AND  b)  No  requirement  for  an  alternative  sedative 
medication, AND c) No requirement of more than 5 doses of study medication within any 15 min 
window.  (In  the  case  of midazolam: no  requirement  of  more  than 3  doses within  any  12  min 
window.) 
These composite endpoints are in general acceptable although depending on the clinician’s perspective, 
completing the colonoscopy/bronchoscopy might be more clinically relevant than not requiring rescue 
sedative. 
Main secondary endpoints are clinically relevant time-to-event endpoints. 
Statistical inference for study 006 and 008 was based on comparisons with placebo, while comparisons 
with  midazolam  were  regarded  as  exploratory.  The  other  procedural  sedation  studies  presented  only 
descriptive statistical analyses. 
In general, no critical issues were identified during the assessment regarding study conduct and analysis. 
Analysis per treatment arm shows a large reduction in the incidence of deep sedation in remimazolam 
arm  (from  24.5%  to  6.4%),  while  the  incidence  of  deep  sedation  in  other  two  arms  (midazolam  and 
placebo), despite of small number of events, remained almost unchanged (midazolam: from 6.7% to 
9.3%; placebo: from 12.5% to 11.8%). Identical results were obtained when patients with success of 
procedure  were  analysed.  A  reduction  was  also  seen  in  remimazolam  patients  who  received  rescue 
midazolam (from 50% to 9.8%). However, the incidence of deep sedation was higher in those patients 
compared to patients treated with only remimazolam. After fentanyl dose reduction, the incidence of deep 
sedation seems to be of shorter duration. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In  general,  during  the  assessment  of  efficacy  in  procedural  sedation  trials,  only  a  few  issues  were 
identified. Notwithstanding, it has to be kept in mind that the midazolam arm in studies 006, 008 and 
015 was not blinded and the dosing of midazolam was not optimal as discussed earlier. 
In Study CNS7056-003, regarding efficacy results, there seems to be a dose-response relationship. A 
clarification was requested regarding recommendation in section 4.2 of remimazolam SmPC about the 
initial and top-up doses in case of no narcotic medicinal product co-administration. Study 003 is the only 
procedural sedation study in which fentanyl was not used and no top-ups of remimazolam were allowed 
so the basis for the dosing recommendation is unclear. In fact, since the study did not foresee top-up 
doses, the applicant leans on the efficacy and safety of the 5mg plus 2.5 mg dose combination (i.e. top-up 
dose equals 50% of the initial bolus) in pivotal trials as rationale for choosing 3.5mg as top-up dose. In 
other  words,  there  is  no  clinical  data  about  top-ups  in  patients  not  receiving  opioids.  The  applicant 
reduced the top-up dose in patients not receiving opioids from 3.5mg to 2.5mg claiming that this dose is 
‘similarly suited to maintain sedation, albeit when administered with a higher frequency but probably a 
lower  risk  of  over-sedation’.  Top-up  doses  of  2.5mg  are  used  in  patients  receiving  opioids.  Reducing 
Assessment report

Page 87/132 
 
 
 
top-up doses in patients not receiving opioids can be accepted based on the applicant’s claims that the 
dose is similarly suited to maintain sedation.  
An  effect  on  the  respiratory  system  (more  desaturations  and  increased  respiratory  rate)  is  noted  for 
remimazolam compared to midazolam. In Study 003 higher doses of remimazolam were used compared 
to doses intended for clinical use. This alone might be related to more desaturations. No rationale other 
than the comparatively higher dose is presented to explain the difference in hypoxia events leading to 
airway  management  between  remimazolam  (all  dose  levels)  and  midazolam.  This  is  an  acceptable 
explanation for the higher dose levels (0.15 mg/kg and 0.2 mg/kg remimazolam), but not for the lowest 
dose level (0.1 mg/kg remimazolam). However, both the separate healthcare professional who will be 
dedicated to monitoring the patient and the availability of flumazenil mitigate this risk. 
Study CNS7056-004 was not powered for inferential conclusions. Nevertheless, the results for primary 
and secondary efficacy endpoints suggest better efficacy of remimazolam over midazolam in the studied 
setting. All efficacy results are of the same direction and can suggest clinically relevant difference. 
High  success  rates  of  colonoscopy  procedures  were  observed  (92.5%,  95%,  97.5%  vs  75%  for 
8.0/3.0mg, 7.0/2.0mg, 5.0/3.0mg remimazolam vs midazolam group respectively). Significance testing 
of exploratory value was performed for each remimazolam dose and midazolam; remimazolam 7.0/2.0 
and 5.0/3.0 treatment groups were statistically superior to midazolam (p=0.007 and 0.025 respectively). 
The 8.0/3.0 group was not statistically superior to midazolam (p=0.066). These results are important for 
contextualisation of remimazolam vs midazolam, since this is the only study where direct head-to-head 
comparison with double-blind midazolam was done. Requirement for rescue sedative medications was 
lower in remimazolam groups compared to midazolam group. Secondary efficacy endpoints indicated that 
remimazolam treatments led to earlier and quicker (1.5 to 2.0 min according to the applicant; around 0.5 
min according to graphically presented MOAA/S scores by time point) onset of sedation compared to the 
midazolam  treatment.  It  is  questionable,  though,  is  the  modest  shorter  time of  onset  of  sedation  for 
remimazolam clinically significant compared to midazolam. Recovery times were favourable. High initial 
remimazolam doses of 8.0 mg were associated with non-desired deep level of sedation. 
Mean number of top-up doses was lower for remimazolam compared to midazolam. Nevertheless, the 
duration of procedures was similar for all study groups (approx. 13-14 min). 
The lowest remimazolam dose (5.0 mg) achieved the highest procedural sedation success rate and was 
also associated with the quickest recovery times. Thus, this dose was selected for the initial bolus dose in 
the Phase 3 trials. It can be agreed that top-up dose was set at 50% of the initial dose (i.e. 2.5 mg) in the 
Phase 3 trials. 
In Study CNS7056-006 treatment success was observed in 272 (91.3%) patients in the remimazolam 
group, compared to 1 (1.7%) patient in the placebo group and 26 (25.2%) patients in midazolam group. 
The difference in treatment success rates between remimazolam and placebo is 0.8961 (95% CI: 0.8505, 
0.9416) and was statistically significant; between remimazolam and midazolam 0.6603 (95% CI: 0.5705, 
0.7501).  Primary  efficacy  results  favour  remimazolam  over  placebo  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  over 
midazolam. However, success rate of midazolam was quite low, which could be partially explained by 
lower  dose  of  midazolam  used  in  this  study  (lower  than  the  EU  labelled  dose  for  conscious  sedation 
indication).  
As expected, failure of reaching the primary composite outcome is driven by the need for rescue sedative 
medication (midazolam dosed according to clinical practice) and too many doses of treatment drug within 
the  predefined  time  window.  This  may  indicate  medication  error  potential.  The  relative  frequency  of 
‘procedure not completed’ is similar in all 3 treatment arms, which shows that the failure of procedure due 
to reasons unrelated to sedations was similar in all treatment arms, which is reassuring for validity of the 
composite outcome. 
Assessment report  
EMA/160756/2021  
Page 88/132 
 
 
 
The  key  secondary  outcomes  (time-to-event  outcomes)  also  favour  remimazolam  over  placebo  and 
midazolam.  
Time to start of procedure is 15 minutes shorter in remimazolam compared to midazolam and placebo 
arms (difference in median times). Peak sedation is reached in 3 minutes with remimazolam and time to 
peak sedation could not be established for midazolam and placebo. Similarly, time to fully alert from end 
of procedure was 7 minutes shorter in remimazolam compared to midazolam while time to fully alert from 
last  dose  is  10  minutes  shorter  in  remimazolam  compared  to  midazolam  arms.  These  results  point 
towards a faster onset of and recovery from sedative effects of remimazolam compared to midazolam and 
are clinically relevant. 
However, some of the time-to-event results do not seem very clinically relevant - differences in time to 
ready for discharge from the end of colonoscopy is 4 minutes in favour of remimazolam over midazolam 
and 5 minutes over placebo (with overlapping 95% CI). Similarly, time to ready for discharge from last 
dose is 6 minutes in favour of remimazolam over midazolam (with slightly overlapping 95% CI) and 9 
minutes in favour of remimazolam over placebo (95% CI do not overlap) - these results can be viewed as 
having questionable clinical relevance. 
Regarding MOAA/S score by timepoint, at 4 minutes post-dose 89% of patients receiving remimazolam 
are  within  target  range  compared  to  around  21%  of  patients  receiving  placebo  and  around  38%  of 
patients receiving midazolam. At 19 minutes more patients receiving midazolam are within target range 
compared to patients receiving remimazolam or placebo, while the proportion of patients with MOAA/S 
score 5 is largest in remimazolam group. These data suggest a more rapid onset of action of remimazolam 
and a shorter duration of the colonoscopy procedure. However, the results also show a higher relative 
frequency of deep sedation (MOAA/S score 0, equivalent to general anaesthesia) seen at practically all 
timepoints for remimazolam compared to placebo and midazolam.  
Results of  the Drowsiness  VAS  endpoint  also  point  towards  faster  onset  of  sedation  for  remimazolam 
compared to placebo and midazolam; signs of resedation were not observed. Highest mean VAS score for 
remimazolam (86.9) was a larger number compared to highest VAS score for placebo and midazolam 
(82.2 and 78.5, respectively) denoting more severe drowsiness. 
Importantly  from  patient’s  perspective,  time  required  to  feeling  ‘back  to  normal’  was  shorter  with 
remimazolam compared to placebo or midazolam. 
In  Study  CNS7056-008  treatment  success  was  observed  in  250  patients  (80.6%)  in  remimazolam 
group, in 3 patients (4.8%) in placebo and 24 patients (32.9%) in midazolam groups. The difference in 
rates  for  remimazolam  versus  placebo  was  0.7588  (95%-CI:  0.6903,  0.8274)  and  was  statistically 
significant, for remimazolam versus midazolam was 0.4777 (95%-CI: 0.3613, 0.5941). Primary efficacy 
results  favour  remimazolam  over  placebo  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  over  midazolam.  As  expected,  the 
superiority over placebo arises due to the need for a rescue sedative medication which is, by protocol 
definition, treatment failure of placebo. Success rate of midazolam is quite low in itself, which could be 
partially explained by lower dose of midazolam used in this study (lower than the EU labelled dose for 
conscious sedation indication).  
The main secondary outcomes (time-to-event outcomes) also favour remimazolam.  
Time to start of procedure is around 11 minutes shorter for remimazolam compared to midazolam and 13 
minutes  shorter  compared  to  placebo.  Peak  sedation  is  reached in 3.5  minutes,  which  is 3.5  minutes 
quicker in remimazolam compared to midazolam (could not be evaluated for placebo). Time to fully alert 
from last dose is approximately 6 minutes shorter in remimazolam compared to midazolam and 8 minutes 
shorter compared to placebo. These reductions are clinically relevant and point towards a faster onset of 
and faster resolution of sedative effects of remimazolam compared to midazolam.

However,  some  of  the  time-to-event  results  do  not  seem  very  clinically  relevant  when  comparing 
remimazolam and midazolam - the difference in time to ready for discharge from end of procedure and 
time to ready for discharge from last dose is 5 and 6 minutes in favour of remimazolam over midazolam 
(with  slightly  overlapping  95%  CI  of  the  median  time),  respectively.  Time  to  fully  alert  from  end  of 
procedure is 6 minutes in favour of remimazolam over midazolam, but with overlapping 95% CI of the 
median time. 
MOAA/S  scores  by  time  point  indicate  a  shorter  time  elapsed  from  the  injection  of  the  sedative  to 
beginning of the procedure with remimazolam compared to placebo and midazolam. 
Data for MOAA/S score by timepoint show a higher relative frequency of deep sedation (MOAA/S score 0, 
equivalent  to  general  anaesthesia)  with  remimazolam  compared  to  other  two  treatment  arms  at  the 
majority of timepoints. In remimazolam arm, MOAA/S score of 0 is first noted at 1-minute post-dose and 
the relative frequency of score 0 remains higher (at around 2%) in remimazolam compared to midazolam 
and placebo (0%) up to 19 minutes postdose. At 19 and 20 minutes (the last two observed timepoints), 
the relative frequency of MOAA/S score 0 is higher in midazolam arm. The tendency of remimazolam to 
produce deep sedation shortly after dosing (observed after 1 minute) is noted; this may pose a limitation 
for the use of remimazolam.  
A coping strategy for clinical practice regarding unintended deep sedation observed in clinical trials was 
requested,  with  several updates  to  SmPC  were  proposed to  detail  or  reinforce  this,  namely  to  inform 
clinicians about a very fast onset and offset of sedation, with information regarding how soon after the 
initial bolus peak sedation occurs and how long does sedation last. Time to fully alert from last dose of 
remimazolam (12-14 minutes) instead of time to fully alert after the end of procedure was also included.  
Recall of the procedure was comparatively low and patient satisfaction with sedation was comparatively 
high in all three treatment groups. 
Results of the Drowsiness VAS point towards faster onset of sedation for remimazolam (highest mean 
VAS score detected at 5 minutes postdose for remimazolam) compared to midazolam (highest mean VAS 
score detected at 25 minutes postdose for midazolam). Highest mean VAS score for remimazolam (85.6) 
was  a  larger  number  compared  to  highest  VAS  score  for  placebo  and  midazolam  (81.4  and  72.1, 
respectively) denoting more severe drowsiness. No signs of resedation were observed. 
Median time required to feeling back to normal (self-evaluated by patients) was similar in remimazolam 
and midazolam groups and shorter compared to placebo arm. The interquartile range were very similar 
for remimazolam and midazolam, denoting an absence of benefit of remimazolam from a clinical point of 
view regarding this outcome. 
In  Study  CNS7056-015  higher  success  rates  of  colonoscopy  procedures  were  recorded  for  patients 
receiving  remimazolam  (84.4%  vs  0%  and  12.9%  for  placebo  and  midazolam  group  respectively). 
Reasons for procedure failure were common for all study groups, and for the most failures included use of 
rescue sedative medications and too many doses within the pre-defined time window (multiple reasons 
observed in most participants). Later suggests potential for medication errors. 
Most of secondary efficacy endpoints are supportive of better efficacy properties of remimazolam, but it 
is difficult to assess clinical meaningfulness of the results. Mean fentanyl dose was numerically lower in 
remimazolam group. Median time to start of procedure was 13-14 min shorter in remimazolam group 
compared  to  placebo  and  midazolam,  which  seems  substantial  and  could  be  meaningful  for  clinical 
practice. Median time to fully alert from the end of procedure was 2.3-4 min shorter in remimazolam 
group  compared  to  placebo  and  midazolam.  Median  time  to  fully  alert  from  last  dose  was  7-7.8  min 
shorter in remimazolam group (95%CI 8.8, 12.0) compared to placebo and midazolam. 
Assessment report  
EMA/160756/2021  
Page 90/132 
 
 
 
MOAA/S scores by the time point are suggestive of faster onset of sedation in remimazolam group in 
comparison  with  placebo  and  midazolam.  At  1.5  minutes  after  administration  29.0%  patients  in 
remimazolam group who had an MOAA/S score of ≤3, i.e. adequately sedated to begin the procedure (vs 
0  and  3.3%  in  placebo  and  midazolam  group  respectively).  The  median  time  to  procedure  in 
remimazolam group was 8 minutes after initiating treatment compared to 18.6 minutes in midazolam and 
20 minutes in placebo groups. 
Drowsiness VAS is presented by the time points and the trend was positive in remimazolam group until 15 
min  post-dose  suggesting  higher  level  of  drowsiness  produced  by  remimazolam.  There  was  no 
requirement for flumazenil during the procedure reported in any study group. Peak sedation from first 
dose  was  not  comparable  with  placebo  and  midazolam  groups.  There  was  no  important  difference 
observed for recall of the procedure by the Brice questionnaire and for investigator’s satisfaction with the 
sedation agent. 
Although no inferential statistics are available for the study 015, presented data suggest better efficacy 
of remimazolam over placebo and midazolam in the studied setting. 
Sensitivity analysis for the primary outcome based on total fentanyl received and initial fentanyl dose 
showed similar results to those seen in the primary efficacy analysis for remimazolam versus placebo in 
studies 006 and 008. For remimazolam versus midazolam the sensitivity analysis showed similar results 
to those seen in primary efficacy analysis except that the difference in success rates was smaller for the 
initial fentanyl stratum ≥75 μg (0.0067 [95%-CI: -0.3244, 0.3377]) in study 008. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Efficacy of remimazolam over placebo and to a lesser extent over midazolam for procedural sedation in 
patients  undergoing  colonoscopy  and  bronchoscopy  was  demonstrated.  Comparison  with  midazolam 
needs to be viewed as exploratory, since it was subdosed regarding to EU practice and it was administered 
in an open-label fashion in all phase 3 trials.  
Success  of  procedure  was  higher  with  remimazolam  compared  to  placebo  in  the  pivotal  trials.  These 
results were statistically significant and clinically relevant, supporting the marketing authorisation in the 
claimed indication.  
Procedures in the pivotal trials were of relatively short duration; majority of them lasted less than 30 
minutes.  Analysis  of  efficacy  and  safety  data  from  pivotal  studies  in  procedural  sedation  has  been 
conducted separately for 2 categories: procedures lasting for 30 minutes of less and procedures lasting 
for more than 30 minutes. Efficacy of remimazolam in longer duration procedures is reduced compared to 
shorter procedures but is still higher than efficacy with placebo in longer procedures. Recovery time with 
remimazolam is prolonged in longer procedures compared to shorter procedures. Also, recovery time with 
remimazolam  in  longer  procedures  is  prolonged  compared  to  midazolam  in  longer  procedures.    This 
suggests that patients undergoing procedures of short duration can be expected to have more benefit of 
remimazolam  treatment  compared  to  patients  undergoing  procedures  of  longer  ≥30  min  duration. 
Consequently, the results were presented in the SmPC separately for procedures shorter and longer than 
30min in order to inform the prescribers of this difference.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The evaluation of the safety of remimazolam in procedural sedation was based primarily on the pooled 
data  of  750  subjects  from  controlled  clinical  trials  (CNS7056-004,  CNS7056-006,  CNS7056-008,  and 
CNS7056-015).  Safety  in  subjects  with  hepatic  impairment  was  assessed  in  a  dedicated  trial 
(ONO-2745IVU007, 11 subjects) and safety in subjects with renal impairment was assessed in another 
dedicated trial (CNS7056-012, 11 subjects). As remimazolam is a benzodiazepine with abuse potential, a 
dedicated  trial  was  conducted  in  recreational  CNS  depressant  users  (CNS7056-014,  40  subjects). 
Comparisons of safety profiles were conducted between the Total Remimazolam group (any dose) and the 
Total Midazolam group (combination of midazolam dosed according to the USPI and common medical 
practice) as well as the Placebo group. 
Additionally, the applicant submitted the pooled ISS analyses which are comprised of safety data from the 
22 trials (around 1,700 subjects) in the IV remimazolam clinical development programme. Those includes 
trials in general anaesthesia, ICU sedation, healthy volunteers and special populations as well. There is 
one additional trial concerning oral administration of remimazolam.

treatment  (from  first  to  last  bolus  dose)  was  10.64/9.46  min  (range  1.00  to  49.50  min).  The 
mean/median  number  of  supplemental  bolus  doses  was  2.3/2.0  (range  0  to  10).  The  mean/median 
cumulative fentanyl dose was 90.6/75.0 μg (range 25 to 450 μg), and the mean/median time between 
initial fentanyl dose and first dose of remimazolam was 2.44/2.00 min (range 0.0 to 12.0 min). 
As  with  other  benzodiazepines,  the  sedative  effects  of  remimazolam  can  be  reversed  by  the  GABAA 
antagonist flumazenil, offering an additional safety measure in case of overdose and unintentional “deep” 
sedation.  During  the  clinical  development  in  procedural  sedation,  no  remimazolam-treated  subjects 
required reversal with flumazenil for safety reasons. 
Patient exposure 
A total of 1731 (100.0%) subjects received IV remimazolam in the 22 clinical trials of IV remimazolam. Of 
these,  870  (50.3%)  of  all  subjects  received  remimazolam  in  any  trial  in  procedural  sedation 
(CNS7056-002 
[Part  B],  CNS7056-003,  CNS7056-004,  CNS7056-006,  CNS7056-008,  and 
CNS7056-015) represented in ISS Group A. ISS Group A1, the main group for comparison, represents the 
controlled 
trials 
in  procedural  sedation  (CNS7056-004,  CNS7056-006,  CNS7056-008,  and 
CNS7056-015), in which 750 subjects received remimazolam (43.3% of subjects overall and 86.2% of all 
subjects exposed in context of procedural sedation), 242 subjects received midazolam, and 135 subjects 
received placebo. In all controlled clinical trials in procedural sedation, an opioid premedication (i.e., IV

fentanyl at 25-100 μg) was administered for its analgesic effect prior to the initial dose of remimazolam 
and during the procedure as needed in accordance with standard clinical practice. 
Other subjects treated with remimazolam were 527 (30.5% of all subjects; ISS Group B) undergoing 
surgery in the trials in general anaesthesia, 223 (12.9% of all subjects; ISS Group C) healthy volunteers, 
and an additional 111 subjects, comprising 49 subjects in the ICU sedation trial, 11 subjects with hepatic 
impairment, 11 subjects with renal impairment, and 40 subjects who were recreational CNS depressant 
users.

Medical history and prior/concomitant medicinal products (Safety population - ISS Group A1) 
Medical history of hypertension was the most frequent in all three groups, and it was lower in the Total 
Remimazolam  group  (47.6%)  than  in  the  Total  Midazolam  group  (52.1%)  and  the  Placebo  group 
(60.7%).  Other  medical  history  records  found  in  over  20%  of  subject  in  any  group  were 
gastrooesophageal  reflux  disease  (Total  Remimazolam:  33.5%,  Total  Midazolam:  33.1%,  Placebo: 
35.6%),  hyperlipidaemia  (Total  Remimazolam:  21.2%,  Total  Midazolam:  16.5%,  Placebo:  24.4%), 
depression  (Total  Remimazolam:  19.6%,  Total  Midazolam:  17.4%,  Placebo:  27.4%),  drug 
hypersensitivity (Total Remimazolam: 18.8%, Total Midazolam: 21.1%, Placebo: 27.4%), anxiety (Total 
Remimazolam: 18.1%, Total Midazolam: 16.1%, Placebo: 25.9%), COPD (Total Remimazolam: 16.4%, 
Total Midazolam: 14.5%, Placebo: 23.0%).

Common Adverse Events 
According to the applicant, the incidence of these events in remimazolam subjects was similar or lower 
than that observed in midazolam or placebo subjects in most cases. For any event that occurred more 
frequently in the Total Remimazolam group than in the Total Midazolam or Placebo groups, the difference 
in incidence between the groups was <5%.

Treatment Emergent Adverse Events are defined as adverse events that started or worsened on or after the

According  to  the  applicant,  most  of  subjects  experienced  events  with  a  maximum  severity  of  mild  or 
moderate as assessed by the Investigator. Frequencies of events assessed as severe were similar across 
the 3 groups: 20 subjects (2.7%) in the Total Remimazolam group, in 6 subjects (2.5%) in the Total 
Midazolam group, and in 2 subjects (1.5%) in the Placebo group. Severe TEAEs in the Total Remimazolam 
group included hypertension (3 subjects), hypoxia, bradycardia, and bronchospasm (2 subjects each),

and  hypotension,  blood  pressure  decreased,  hypercalcaemia,  lobar  pneumonia,  confusional  state, 
oropharyngeal  pain,  pneumothorax,  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  (COPD),  acute  respiratory 
failure,  aspiration,  and  abdominal  pain  (1  subject  each).  Severe  TEAEs  in  the  Total  Midazolam  group 
included hypertension (4 subjects), ECG QT prolonged and neck pain (1 subject each). Severe TEAEs in 
the Placebo group included hypoxia, bronchospasm, and back pain (1 subject each).  
The applicant is discussing that because the side effect profile of fentanyl overlaps somewhat in the areas 
of respiratory and haemodynamic effects, the potential influence should be taken into consideration when 
reviewing incidences of TEAEs and vital sign changes. 
Furthermore,  the  applicant  is  arguing  that,  as  a  result  of  regulatory  requirements  (FDA)  regarding 
pre-defined  changes  in  vital  signs  with  focus  on  cardio-respiratory  parameters,  there  may  have  been 
over-reporting and inflation of the rates of these types of events. Further analyses were performed on 
heart rate, respiratory rate, SpO2). 
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
The applicant has done standardised and customised MedDRA queries with purpose of identifying adverse 
reactions for the target indication of procedural sedation. Filtered TEAEs:  
•  Hypoxia:  The  proportions  of  subjects  experiencing  hypoxia  were  slightly  lower  in  the  Total 
Remimazolam than in the Total Midazolam and the Placebo treatment groups (13.1%, 14.0%, 
and 15.6%, respectively). 
•  Bradycardia: The incidence of bradycardia was slightly lower in the Total Remimazolam than in 
the Total Midazolam and Placebo treatment groups (7.1%, 10.7%, and 8.9%). 
•  Hypotension:  The  incidence  of  hypotension  was  lower  in  the  Total  Remimazolam  treatment 
group  than in  both  the  Total  Midazolam  and  Placebo  treatment  groups  (37.3%,  49.2%,  and 
57.0%, respectively). 
•  Hypersensitivity events were reported in 4 remimazolam subjects (0.5%), 0 midazolam, and 1 
(0.7%) placebo subjects. 
•  Drug-related hepatic disorder events were not reported in any group. 
•  Acute renal failure events were not reported in any group. 
•  Haemorrhage events were found in 8 (1.1%) remimazolam, 3 (1.2%) midazolam and 3 (2.2%) 
placebo subjects. 
Other findings relevant to safety 
Vital signs findings are integral part of common AEs and AEs of special interest, so they are not analysed 
separately here. 
ECG findings – According to the applicant, 3 subjects in the Total Remimazolam treatment group (0.4%) 
had  ECG  shifts  from  normal  or  abnormal/not  clinically  significant  at  baseline  to  abnormal/clinically 
significant as their worst post-dose result in ISS Group A1. One subject developed nonspecific ST and T 
wave  abnormalities  immediately  after  her  first  dose  of  remimazolam.  Another  subject  developed 
multifocal  atrial  tachycardia  after  her  first  dose  of  remimazolam.  The  third  subject  developed  sinus 
tachycardia that was reported for every 10 minutes during the procedure and 5 minutes after the end of 
the procedure. These events resolved without sequalae. 
Airway interventions – In the controlled trials in procedural sedation (ISS Group A1), the proportion of 
subjects in need of an airway intervention was higher in the Total Remimazolam treatment group (10.1%) 
than in the Total Midazolam (6.2%) or Placebo (8.9%) treatment groups. However, the most frequent 
Assessment report  
EMA/160756/2021  
Page 99/132 
 
 
 
airway  intervention  was  changes  in  oxygen  flow,  reported  in  8.5%,  3.7%,  and  5.9%  in  the  Total 
Remimazolam, Total Midazolam, and Placebo groups, respectively. The numbers of “true” interventions, 
such as chin lifts, jaw thrusts, etc., were low and comparable between all treatment groups. Short-term 
manual ventilation was employed in 0.8%, 0% and 2.2% of subjects in the Total Remimazolam, Total 
Midazolam,  and  Placebo  treatment  groups,  respectively.  No  subjects  required  emergency  intubation. 
According  to  the  applicant,  all  of  these  interventions  can  be  professionally  and  safely  handled  by  the 
respective endoscopy staff. 
Deep  sedation  -  In  the  controlled  trials  in  procedural  sedation  (ISS  Group  A1),  27.7%  of  subjects on 
Remimazolam had an MOAA/S score of 0 or 1 (indicating deep sedation) at any time during sedation, 
compared  to  15.7%  of  midazolam  subjects  and  11.9%  of  placebo  subjects  (most  of  whom  received 
rescue midazolam). 
Figure 8: Mean (± 95% CI) MOAA/S score by Time-point in Controlled Trials in Procedural 
Sedation with Analgesia (ISS Group A1 – safety population) 
According  to  the  applicant,  observed  incidence  of  MOAA/S  scores  of  0  or  1  however  appears  to  be  a 
function of the initial concomitant dose of fentanyl. For remimazolam, the incidence of MOAA/S 0 or 1 was 
clearly  more  common  in  subjects  who  received  the  initial  fentanyl  dose  of  75  μg  (46.5%)  and  was 
successfully reduced to 8.0% with 50 μg initial fentanyl bolus as implemented by protocol amendments in 
the Phase III trials CNS7056-006, CNS7056-008, and CNS7056-015. It remains somewhat speculative 
whether the further reduction to less than 50 μg (i.e., 25 μg) has the potential to further reduce this 
incidence. This dependency is less striking for both midazolam and placebo, mainly due to the rather low 
number of subjects in the lowest category of less than 50 μg. Vital signs and TEAEs pertaining to hypoxia, 
bradycardia, or hypotension did not show any correlation to the level of consciousness (MOAA/S scores), 
regardless of the treatment.

The proportion of subjects in the Total Remimazolam treatment group with MOAA/S scores of 0 or 1 did 
not appear to be related to the time between the first dose of fentanyl and the first dose of remimazolam. 
The applicant concludes that condition of deep sedation (MOAA/S score of 0 or 1) did not appear to be 
associated with any adverse effect on vital signs regardless of the treatment. In particular, there was no 
clear evidence that a state of deep sedation resulted in more AE, clinically notable vital sign abnormalities 
and  airway  interventions  for  any  of  the  administered  treatments.  The  higher  proportion  of  patients 
experiencing  deep  sedation  at  any  time  during  the  treatment  under  the  combination  of  5  mg 
remimazolam and 75 μg fentanyl initial dose could be successfully mitigated by a lower initial dose of 
fentanyl,  i.e.,  50  μg.  The  regimen  of  50  μg  fentanyl  with  5  mg  remimazolam  or  midazolam  dosed 
according to the USPI resulted in equally low proportion of subjects experiencing deep sedation. 
Abuse potential - In the 22 trials in the remimazolam clinical development programme that were included 
in the pooled analyses, no subject experienced a TEAE in the SMQ drug abuse and dependence. In the 
controlled trials (Group A1), the rates of TEAEs in the customised MedDRA Abuse Potential were similar on 
remimazolam  (1.5%)  and  midazolam  (0.8%);  these  events  were  most  commonly  dizziness  and 
somnolence. Searching the whole clinical database of 1,731 subjects exposed to remimazolam with the 
SMQ Drug Abuse, Dependence and Withdrawal did not reveal a single case. 
Administration routes alternative to intravenous, such as oral and intranasal had no abuse potential on 
account of the extremely low oral bioavailability and the significant nasal pain produced by remimazolam 
(trials CNS7056-016 and CNS7056-019, respectively). A dedicated abuse liability trial (CNS7056-014) 
showed  that  remimazolam  had  an  abuse  potential  similar  to  or  lower  than  that  of  midazolam  via  i.v. 
injection. 
Even though remimazolam will be used strictly in controlled hospital settings, there might be a risk of 
repeated  administration  of  remimazolam  (e.g.  in  patients  requiring  multiple  diagnostic  or  therapeutic 
procedures) which might cause drug dependence. Repeated administrations were tested in a Phase 1 trial 
(CNS7056-019) where subjects were exposed 7 times to remimazolam (1 intravenous and 6 intranasal 
administrations)  within  17  days.  The  trial  did  not  show  systematic  trends  in  the  occurrence  of 
abuse-related events with multiple remimazolam exposure (e.g. tolerance or sensitisation) that could be 
indicative of any development of dependence 
Withdrawal and rebound - Dependence potential has been studied in self-administration experiments in 
monkeys,  during  induction  of  physical  dependence  in  rats  and  monkeys,  and  the  development  of 
tolerance  in  micropigs.  Results  indicate  that  remimazolam,  like  other  benzodiazepines,  has 
dependence-inducing potential. However, no withdrawal symptoms have been detected in clinical trials 
with remimazolam. In the 22 trials in the IV remimazolam clinical development programme included in 
Assessment report  
EMA/160756/2021  
Page 101/132 
 
 
 
 
the  pooled  analyses,  no  subject  experienced  a  TEAE  in  the  SMQ  drug  withdrawal.  Due  to  the  short 
exposure  time  to  remimazolam  during  sedation  for  diagnostic  or  therapeutic  procedures,  withdrawal 
symptoms are not expected in this clinical setting. 
Pain at injection site – Injection site pain was explored by employing VAS (or verbal) scores.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
Overall, amongst the 1731 subjects who received IV remimazolam, there was no TEAE with an outcome 
of  death.  Although  no  subjects  died  during  treatment  with  remimazolam,  1  subject  in  Group  B  died 
approximately 7 months after completing treatment with remimazolam for general anaesthesia.  
This subject with a history of aortic valve stenosis grade III, single vessel disease, aneurysm of ascending 
aorta,  atrial  fibrillation,  systemic  hypertension,  hyperlipidemia,  presbyakusis,  status  post  surgery  for 
prostate cancer, and heart insufficiency NYHA II received remimazolam as a continuous infusion. The 
patient  experienced  life-threatening  acute  renal  failure  the  day  after  remimazolam  treatment  and 
surgery. The reaction was considered to be serious by the reporter as it was medically important and 
life-threatening. The patient received continuous venovenous haemodialysis as a corrective therapy for 
the event. The event was ongoing, and the subject died approximately 7 months after study treatment; 
the cause of death was unknown. A number of other concomitant medications were reported. According 
to the provided CIOMS report, both the Investigator and the Sponsor considered the adverse event to be 
not related to study medication.  
Other Serious Adverse Events 
Of the subjects in controlled trials in procedural sedation (Group A1), 2.3% in the Total Remimazolam 
group, 0.4% in the Total Midazolam group, and 3.0% in the Placebo group, experienced at least 1 SAE. In 
general,  the  incidence  of  SAEs  was  low,  and  it  was  similar  between  the  Total  Remimazolam  and  the 
Placebo groups but higher than in the Total Midazolam group.  
All SAEs in procedural sedation were exclusively reported from a single trial (CNS7056-008) which was 
performed  in  the  clinical  setting  of  bronchoscopy.  According  to  the  applicant,  this  biased  the  type  of 
reported SAEs with the vast majority (13/17) falling in the SOC Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal 
disorders.

Note: 
For each category, subjects are included only once, even if they experienced multiple events in that system 
organ class or preferred term. 
Treatment Emergent Adverse Events are defined as adverse events that started or worsened on or after the 
first study medication dose or fentanyl pretreatment date/time. 
All of the SAEs in Group A1 subjects who received remimazolam were assessed by the Investigator as 
unlikely / not related to study treatment except for 2 events in 1 subject in the remimazolam group in trial 
CNS7056-008. The 2 events were bradycardia and hypoxia. For both events, the relationship to study 
treatment was assessed as “certain” and study treatment was withdrawn.

associated with remimazolam.  
Safety in special populations 
Age 
The incidences of TEAEs increased with increasing age in all treatment groups, except for events from the 
SOC Cardiac disorders. The increase was not always apparent in the age ≥75 years group, however those 
groups had a small sample size.

Pregnancy and breastfeeding 
An increased risk of congenital malformations associated with the use of benzodiazepine drugs (diazepam 
and chlordiazepoxide) has been suggested in several trials. There are no adequate and well controlled 
trials of remimazolam in pregnant women. One subject in clinical trial CNS7056-005 became pregnant 
with date of conception one or two days after remimazolam administration. A healthy male baby was 
delivered at term, and the child was developing normally at 3.5 months when the follow-up information 
was received. 
Reproductive  toxicity  studies  on  rabbits  and  rats  were  performed  and  revealed  no  abnormalities. 
According  to  the  applicant,  since  animal  reproduction  studies  are  not  always  predictive  of  human 
response, the drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. However, according to the 
nonclinical assessment, the non-clinical package should be treated as insufficient data and remimazolam 
is not recommended during pregnancy and in woman of childbearing potential not using contraception 
(see non-clinical AR). 
Remimazolam has been shown to be excreted in breast milk in animal studies. It is not known whether 
remimazolam is excreted in human milk; however, midazolam is excreted in human milk. Following oral 
administration, remimazolam undergoes rapid and extensive first-pass metabolism, and, as a result, has 
very low oral bioavailability (2.2% based of systemic exposure and 1.2% based on maximum plasma 
concentration). The applicant advises nursing mothers to stop breast-feeding for 24 h after remimazolam 
administration. 
Hepatic impairment 
The PK/PD effects of remimazolam in subjects with hepatic impairment were evaluated in Phase I Study 
ONO-2745IVU007 which included 8 patients with moderate hepatic impairment (score of 7 to 9 on the 
Child-Pugh scale) and 9 healthy matched subjects, as well as 3 patients with severe hepatic impairment 
(score of 10 to 15 on the Child-Pugh scale).  
The half-life (t½) was prolonged with increasing severity of hepatic impairment (mean ± SD 42.9 ± 17.5 
minutes,  59.2  ±  11.7  minutes,  and  105  ±  29.7  minutes  in  healthy,  moderate,  and  severe  hepatic 
impairment subjects, respectively). Total exposure to remimazolam (as indicated by AUCinf), was larger 
in patients with severe hepatic impairment than in healthy subjects and patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment (AUCinf mean ± SD were 16.6 ± 4.78, 17.9 ± 4.02, and 29.6 ± 2.85 ng/h/mL in healthy, 
moderate, and severe hepatic impairment, respectively). Duration of sedation and time for recovery from 
sedative effects were longer for patients with hepatic impairment compared to healthy control subjects. 
The average duration of loss of consciousness was 1.6, 3.2, and 2.0 minutes in healthy, moderate, and 
severe hepatic impairment, respectively. Time to recovery was 8.0, 12.1, and 16.7 minutes in healthy, 
moderate, and severe hepatic impairment, respectively. 
According  to  the  applicant,  moderate  dose  adjustments  in  patients  with  severe  hepatic  impairment 
appear appropriate, whereas no dose adjustments are needed for subjects with mild or moderate hepatic 
impairment.  
Renal impairment 
The PK/PD effects of remimazolam in subjects with renal impairment were evaluated in Phase I Study 
CNS7056-012 which included 12 subjects with normal renal function and 11 subjects with end-stage renal 
disease (ESRD) not on dialysis (6 subjects with eGFR of 15 to 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 5 subjects with 
eGFR of <15 mL/min/1.73 m2). The concentration-time profile and PK after a single IV dose of 1.5 mg IV 
Remimazolam did not show relevant differences in ESRD subjects compared to subjects with normal renal 
function. The excretion of the main metabolite CNS7054 however was prolonged in subjects with renal 
Assessment report

Page 107/132 
 
 
 
impairment;  however,  this  metabolite  is  pharmacological  inactive.  Based  on  these  results,  no  dose 
adjustment is suggested for renal impairment patients. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Extrinsic Factors 
To evaluate abuse potential, the effect of alcohol on the PK and PD of orally administered Remimazolam 
was evaluated in Phase I Study CNS7056 020. 
Compared  to  remimazolam  alone,  the  number  of  TEAEs  increased  with  remimazolam  +  alcohol, 
depending on the concentration of alcohol. However, the incidence of TEAEs was comparable between 
Remimazolam + 40% alcohol and 40% alcohol alone, indicating that the increase in the number of TEAEs 
observed following the coadministration of alcohol and remimazolam was, most likely, solely dependent 
on  the  dose  of  co-administered  alcohol.  There  is  a  potential  for  slightly  enhanced  PD  effects  when 
remimazolam and alcohol are co-administered, compared to remimazolam alone.Results of the trial led to 
the overall conclusion that a combination of 18 vials of the remimazolam drug product (360 mg) and 150 
mL of 40% v/v alcohol did not result in a predictable and reliable level of sedation that would allow for 
drug-facilitated criminal assaults. Moreover, the sheer amount of remimazolam and alcohol needed to 
produce significant sedation, together with the remarkably bitter taste of remimazolam do not suggest 
any potential whatsoever for the remimazolam-alcohol combination to incapacitate a victim. 
Drug Interactions 
The sedative effect of remimazolam can be accentuated by any concomitantly administered medication 
that  depresses  the  CNS  such  as  sedative-hypnotics  and  narcotics,  (e.g.,  other  benzodiazepines, 
[fos-]propofol, and opioid agonists). 
Risks from Concomitant Use With Opioids 
Comparisons of TEAEs across fentanyl dose groups are best characterised with pooled data from three 
Phase III trials (CNS7056 006, CNS7056 008, and CNS7056 015; i.e. Group A1A). This is because these 
trials cover the whole range of fentanyl dose from <75 µg to >150 µg, whereas the other controlled trial 
in procedural sedation (CNS7056 004) only covers higher doses of fentanyl >100 µg. More importantly, 
Phase  III  trial  protocols  pre-defined  certain  criteria  for  reporting  AEs  with  focus  on  respiratory  and 
haemodynamic effects (as mentioned earlier), which are slightly different for CNS7056 004. 
Table  34  presents  incidences  of  TEAEs  in  SOCs  Cardiac  disorders,  Vascular  disorders,  Respiratory, 
thoracic and mediastinal disorders, and Investigations in Group A1A. It is apparent that higher cumulative 
doses  of  fentanyl  were  associated  with  increased  rates  of  respiratory  and  haemodynamic  AEs  in  all 
treatment groups. The same trend was observed in the SMQ/CMQ analyses of Hypotension, Bradycardia, 
and Hypoxia

Furthermore, higher initial doses of fentanyl (>50 μg) were associated with an increased frequency of an 
MOAA/S score of 0 or 1. It is known that concomitant use of benzodiazepines with opioids can result in 
profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Our analyses showed that remimazolam is 
similar  to  midazolam  with  regards  to  these  interactions.  Remimazolam  should  therefore  be  used  for 
sedation only in the same infrastructure as midazolam, i.e., under presence of personnel skilled in early 
detection  of  hypoventilation,  maintaining  a  patent  airway,  and  supporting  ventilation.  Immediate 
availability of oxygen, resuscitative drugs, appropriate equipment for bag/valve/mask ventilation and a 
specific reversal agent (flumazenil) is highly recommended. Corresponding language is incorporated into 
the SmPC.

Pharmacokinetic Drug Interactions 
Remimazolam is metabolised via hydrolysis by tissue esterases, predominantly expressed in the liver. 
Because it is not a CYP substrate, exposure is not expected to be affected by drugs that induce or inhibit 
CYP enzymes. Remimazolam and its primary metabolite, CNS7054, do not induce or inhibit any tested 
CYP enzymes, and they are not substrates of - nor do they cause any relevant inhibition of - the tested 
human drug transporters. Thus, there is a low potential for PK drug interactions. 
Clinical Drug Interactions 
The  clinical  safety  data  were  examined  for  any  evidence  of  an  interaction  between  remimazolam  and 
other drugs (concomitant fentanyl [either as initial or cumulative dose]; concomitant antihypertensive 
drugs;  sedative  or  hypnotic  drugs;  and  concomitant  or  prior  chronic  use  of  opiates  and/or 
benzodiazepines),  and  between  remimazolam  and  concomitant  conditions  (hypertension,  COPD, 
pre-existing mental impairment, and gastrointestinal impairment). The primary analyses were based on 
the controlled trials in procedural sedation (Group A1). The following potential interactions were noted: 
• 
Subjects receiving concomitant antihypertensive medications appeared to have a higher 
incidence of all TEAEs and TEAEs that were Vascular disorders (including hypotension and 
hypertension)  and  Respiratory,  thoracic,  and  mediastinal  disorders  (including  hypoxia 
and tachypnea) on all remimazolam, midazolam and placebo. The incidences were similar 
across  groups  but  were  not  consistently  different  between  subjects  with  and  without 
antihypertensive medication (Table 35 below). 
• 
Subjects  on  remimazolam  receiving  concomitant  sedative/hypnotic  medications 
appeared to have a higher incidence of all TEAEs and TEAEs that were Vascular disorders 
(including  hypotension  and  hypertension);  Respiratory,  thoracic,  and  mediastinal 
disorders (including hypoxia and tachypnea); and Investigations (including respiratory 
rate increased, respiratory rate decreased, and blood pressure diastolic decreased). The 
effect could not be compared to placebo because only 5 subjects randomised to placebo 
were not taking concomitant sedatives/hypnotics (Table 36 below). 
• 
On  remimazolam  and  midazolam,  subjects  with  pre-existing  arterial  hypertension 
appeared to have a higher incidence of all TEAEs and TEAEs that were Vascular disorders 
(including  hypotension  and  hypertension)  and  Respiratory,  thoracic,  and  mediastinal 
disorders (including hypoxia and tachypnea) than those without arterial hypertension. On 
placebo, subjects with pretrial arterial hypertension appeared to have a lower incidence 
or  similar  incidence  of  all  TEAEs  and  all  TEAEs  in  the  SOCs  Vascular  disorders  and 
Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders when compared to those without arterial 
hypertension. However, the incidences of the specific events hypotension, hypertension, 
hypoxia, and tachypnea had a similar pattern as that shown for subjects on remimazolam 
and midazolam, i.e., higher incidence among subjects with arterial hypertension (Table 
37 below). 
These risks can be minimised by dose individualisation and titration to desired clinical response. The low 
numbers of subjects in some subgroups precluded assessment of some interactions.

In all treatment groups (remimazolam, midazolam and placebo), the incidence of TEAEs was higher in 
patients  who  were  also  receiving  antihypertensive  medications  compared  to  patients  not  receiving 
antihypertensive  medications.  The  same  was  observed  for  patients  receiving  sedative/hypnotic  drugs 
across treatment groups.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In controlled trials in procedural sedation, 1 subject in the Total Remimazolam group (0.1%), 1 subject in 
Total  Midazolam  group  (0.4%),  and  0  subjects  in  the  Placebo  group  had  at  least  1  TEAE  leading  to 
discontinuation of study treatment. 
The remimazolam-treated subject was in the 5 mg dose group in Study CNS7056-008 and experienced 
two severe SADRs of hypoxia and bradycardia (relationship to study drug: certain) and 7 mild TEAEs of 
hypertension  (possible  [3  events]),  hypotension  (possible  [3  events]),  and  respiratory  rate  increased 
(possible) with outcome of recovered/resolved. This case, with reported PTs that included hypoxia and 
bradycardia, was discussed in an ad-hoc meeting by the Data Monitoring Committee who assessed the 
event as a predictable consequence of administration of a second dose of fentanyl that was twice that 
allowed by the trial protocol, together with trial medication, to an individual with considerable comorbidity 
and  who  was  receiving  concomitant  medication,  including  beta  blockade.  The  applicant  agrees  to  the 
causal association of these events to fentanyl.

The midazolam-treated subject was in the <1.75 mg dose group and discontinued study drug due to an 
AE  of  Grade  2  respiratory  acidosis  (relationship  to  study  drug:  possible;  outcome:  not  recovered/not 
resolved).

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Safety database 
Evaluation  of  remimazolam’s  safety  profile  primarily  concerns  the  target  indication  setting.  Main 
comparisons  are  done  between  Total  Remimazolam  and  Total  Midazolam  groups  (ISS  group  A1).  For 
evaluation of safety it is important to note that 95.2 to 100% of subjects in placebo group have received 
rescue midazolam dosed at the investigator’s discretion. Main safety population of 750 adult subjects 
from active and placebo-controlled trials in target indication that have received remimazolam is deemed 
appropriate  for  safety  profile  characterisations,  although  the  exposure  was  too  small  to  capture  rare 
adverse reactions which is important for overall conclusions. All participants were exposed to an opioid 
(fentanyl) premedication and during the procedures as needed (due to its analgesic properties). Proposed 
doses are investigated. 
Safety database limitation 
The applicant stated some limitations of safety database: a) In all trials, pregnant and lactating women 
were  excluded  from  the  study  population.  The  former  was  because  a  risk  of  congenital  abnormalities 
cannot be excluded. The latter was because it has been shown in nonclinical studies that remimazolam 
and  its  metabolite  were  excreted  in  breast  milk.  Therefore,  remimazolam  is  not  recommended  in 
pregnant  women,  and  lactating  women  are  advised  to  stop  breast-feeding  for  24  h  after  receiving 
remimazolam. b) The clinical development programme is unlikely to detect rare adverse events due to its 
size. These limitations are addressed in the Risk Management Plan for remimazolam. 
Availability of antagonist 
As  with  other  benzodiazepines,  the  sedative  effects  of  remimazolam  can  be  reversed  by  the  GABAA 
antagonist  flumazenil,  offering  an  additional  safety  measure  in  case  of  overdose  and  unintentional 
“deep”  sedation.  During  the  clinical  development  in  procedural  sedation,  no  remimazolam-treated 
subjects required reversal with flumazenil for safety reasons. 
Baseline characteristics of safety population 
According  to  the  baseline  demographic  characteristics,  participants  were  adequately  balanced  among 
compared groups (remimazolam vs midazolam and placebo). There was slight imbalance regarding race, 
but majority of subjects were White. There was no obvious significant finding regarding medical history 
and prior or concomitant medications when explored by frequency of the preferred term in concerned 
safety  population.  None  of  the  clinical  trials  were  conducted  in  EU.  The  applicant  provided  thorough 
discussion on applicability of the data from foreign trials (trials conducted in the US and Japan). It is 
agreed that remimazolam can be classified as a compound not likely to be sensitive to ethnic factors 
according to the ICH E5(R1) guideline.

TEAEs 
Generally, safety profiles of compared groups are similar.  
The most common (>5%) events in Total Remimazolam group by PT were hypotension, hypertension, 
diastolic  hypertension,  systolic  hypertension,  hypoxia,  diastolic  hypotension,  bradycardia,  and 
respiratory rate increased. 
Among TEAEs with incidence ≥1% there are some observed with higher incidence in Total Remimazolam 
group  by  PT  than  Total  Midazolam  group:  diastolic  hypertension,  systolic  hypertension,  hypoxia, 
oropharyngeal pain, respiratory rate increased, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dizziness, pyrexia. 
Observed  TEAEs  indicate  remimazolam’s  potential  for  haemodynamic  and  respiratory  disturbances, 
gastrointestinal disorders, dizziness and pyrexia as most pronounced AEs. Generally, the incidences of 
specific TEAEs by SOCs/PTs are not markedly different when compared to midazolam and placebo (rescue 
midazolam). As participants in midazolam groups have received fentanyl also, the observed TEAEs’ profile 
is deemed attributable to remimazolam regardless of fentanyl administration. 
The applicant pointed out hypoxia, bradycardia and hypotension as important identified risks. Analysis 
done did not revealed any specific AE with higher frequency in Total Remimazolam group compared to 
Total Midazolam (and Placebo) group. 
There  have  been  a  significant  number  of  cases  of  decreased  ventilation  upon  remimazolam 
administration. In the pooled analysis, patients with MOAA/S 1 or zero have occurred in 115/630 cases 
(18.3%); only 9/115 have been identified as respiratory disorder. Of the 67/630 who developed RR less 
than  8/min,  virtually  all  (66)  have  been  identified  as  respiratory  depression.  It  is  interesting  that 
investigators as a whole did not report the episodes as SAEs or as hypoxia AE (1/67). As such, it can be 
reasonably accepted that clinicians have discriminated CNS depression from respiratory depression. 
The  comparison  of  remimazolam  to  midazolam  is  not  much  useful,  as  administration  of  midazolam 
occurred in different circumstances as remimazolam, and therefore, the direct comparison of 2.3% of 
vital  sign  anomalies  as  compared  to  6%  in  midazolam  (and  3.8%  the  called  placebo  patients)  is  not 
possible.  
Unlike  the  applicant’s  conclusion,  it  is  shown  that  overshooting  CNS  depression  does  occur  with 
remimazolam,  with  18%  of  pts  reaching  MOAA/S  ≤1,  and  almost  8%  having  respiratory  disorders 
identified  as  SAE.  It  is  true  that  only  10.6%  did  show  respiratory  rate  decrease,  and  all  have  been 
identified as having respiratory depression or hypoxia by clinicians, with none reported as SAE. It can be 
admitted that all events have been adequately dealt within a CT setting, but the applicant should have 
elaborated more upon extrapolation to the real world. 
Although number of clinically significant ECG abnormalities was low, caution is needed. Studies 005 and 
017  found  that  remimazolam  produced  rapid  and  transient  increases  in  heart  rate  immediately  after 
dosing, but no effects on PR and QRS interval duration or ECG morphology were observed. There was also 
indication that remimazolam has an effect on QT-RR hysteresis but this was assessed as not significant. 
However,  there  are  no  data  for  individuals  that  are  genetically  sensitive  to  potential  QT  prolonging 
medication and the applicant did not conduct drug-drug interaction studies with QT prolonging medication 
and remimazolam. It will be necessary to monitor the effects of remimazolam on ECG abnormalities in the 
postmarketing period.  
A need for airway intervention was observed in Total Remimazolam group and it was higher compared to 
Total Midazolam and Placebo (rescue midazolam) groups. 
Significantly  higher  incidence  of  undesirable  deep  sedation  (MOAA/S  0-1)  in  Total  Remimazolam 
group  compared  to  Total  Midazolam  and  Placebo  (rescue  midazolam)  groups  was  observed.  Major 
Assessment report

difference in level of sedation and time to achieve sedation between remimazolam and midazolam is seen 
during  first  10  to  15  minutes  post-dose.  Remimazolam  achieves  deeper  and  faster  sedation  that  is 
deemed clinically significant from the safety point of view. Furthermore, there seems to be interindividual 
variabilities regarding depth of sedation. Relevant CNS AEs were explored. While confirmed that no case 
of paradoxical reaction or aggressive behaviour has been observed during clinical development, newly 
provided  data  from  SOCs  Psychiatric  disorders,  Nervous  system  disorders,  and  Injury,  poisoning  and 
procedural complications can suggest that there might be some glimpse of possible paradoxical reactions. 
However, overall incidences of concerned AEs are too small to allow conclusions and AEs observed with 
higher incidences are included in the SmPC Section 4.8. Hypothetical discussion regarding paradoxical 
reaction  or  aggressive  behaviour  is  missing.  Nevertheless,  according  to  presented  data,  routine 
post-marketing  pharmacovigilance  will  suffice  at  this  stage.  In  clinical  trials,  no  cases  of  anterograde 
amnesia or paradoxical reactions including hyperactive or aggressive behaviour have occurred. 
The applicant explored the abuse potential of remimazolam, and its withdrawal and rebound effects 
as  benzodiazepines  are  associated  with  abuse  potential,  withdrawal  and  rebound  effects.  Trials  and 
analyses  done  did  not  reveal  development  of  dependence  in  the  controlled  clinical  trials  setting. 
Withdrawal is not expected due to the anticipated short exposure in the procedural sedation setting.  
Injection site pain obtained data did not reveal differences between remimazolam and midazolam.  
Local  tolerance  issues are known for parenteral benzodiazepines, i.e. thrombophlebitic reactions to 
benzodiazepines,  with  diazepam  and  midazolam  as  notable  examples.  Non-clinical  data  revealed  the 
vascular  lesions  at  higher concentrations  of  remimazolam  which  seems  to  reflect  an  effect  frequently 
associated with benzodiazepines.  
According to the applicant, all SAEs in procedural sedation were reported from the bronchoscopy trial 
(CNS7056-008) which biased the type of reported SAEs with the vast majority of them pertaining to SOC 
Respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders.    A  discussion  on  these  observations  has  been 
provided upon request. However, as the depth of sedation is a continuum ranging from minimal sedation 
to general anaesthesia, and the most severe end of spectrum for respiratory effects is respiratory failure, 
in order to be able to manage these complications, performance of sedation with remimazolam must be 
limited to professionals skilled in managing general anaesthesia and providing advanced life support, ie. 
anaesthesiologists or another dedicated ICU trained clinician. The revised SmPC wording was accepted as 
it addresses this issue. Firstly, it states that the administering clinician, experienced in sedation, should 
not be the one conducting the procedure. Secondly, a separate healthcare professional should monitor 
the  patient  throughout  the  procedure,  which  involves  continuous  respiratory  and  cardiovascular 
monitoring. Furthermore, these personnel must be trained in the detection and management of airway 
obstruction,  hypoventilation  and  apnoea,  including  the  maintenance  of  a  patent  airway,  supportive 
ventilation and cardiovascular resuscitation.  
Safety in special populations 
Some adverse events were more frequently observed in  elderly: AEs belonging to the SOC Vascular 
disorders (53.7% vs 75.1% vs 82.0% in groups <65 years, 65-74 years, ≥75 years respectively) and 
hypoxia (5.1% vs 17.2% vs 26.0% in groups <65 years, 65-74 years, ≥75 years respectively). 
In the study 015 (patients with ASA-PS III-IV) treatment-emergent AEs were reported in 90.3% of 
patients in the remimazolam group (58 TEAEs), in 81.3% of patients in the placebo group (30 TEAEs), and 
in 86.7% of patients in the midazolam group (55 TEAEs). All TEAEs reported were mild in severity, with 
the exception of 1 episode of moderate anaemia in a patient in the midazolam group. The majority of 
TEAEs were not considered to be related to treatment; treatment-related TEAEs were reported in 9.7% of 
patients in the remimazolam group, in 12.5% of patients in the placebo group, and in 6.7% of patients in 
the  midazolam  group.  The  most  frequently  reported  events  at  the  SOC  level  were  Vascular  disorders

(81.8%  overall)  and  Respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders  (20.8%  overall).  All  of  the 
treatment-related TEAEs reported during the course of the trial were in these 2 SOCs. There were no 
discontinuation due to TEAEs and there was no serious AE observed in the study 015. The most frequently 
reported TEAEs on the PT level were hypotension (59.7% overall), hypertension (41.6%), and respiratory 
acidosis  (20.8%).  In  patients  aged  ≥65  years,  the  incidence  of  events  grouped  under  the  terms 
hypotension (71.0% versus 56.5%), hypertension (58.1% versus 37.0%), and respiratory depression 
(29.0% versus 23.9%) was greater than in younger patients (<65 years). 
The observed increasing frequency of TEAEs with increasing age and ASA-PS classification was translated 
into a recommendation for a more cautious and individualised dosing in patients  ≥  65  years  of  age 
and/or  with  ASA-PS  III-IV in the proposed SmPC. Increasing incidences with increasing age were 
observed for PT Hypoxia in the SOC Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders and for PTs related to 
Hypotension and Hypertension in the SOC Vascular Disorders. The proposed PI already addresses ADRs 
observed in elderly. 
There are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of remimazolam 
in  pregnant  women.  Animal  studies  do  not  indicate  direct  or  indirect  harmful  effects  with  respect  to 
reproductive  toxicity.  As  a  precautionary  measure,  it  is  preferable  to  avoid  the  use  of  Byfavo  during 
pregnancy.  
Patients with severe hepatic impairment have longer half-life, larger total exposure and longer time to 
recovery with remimazolam compared to healthy subjects. These effects are  more pronounced in the 
severe hepatic impairment groups.  
No dose adjustment is proposed for patients with renal impairment. Based on the presented data and 
provided that there was also no change in the unbound exposure of remimazolam, this is acceptable.  
Given the complexity of the proposed posology for this product, with differences in initial and subsequent 
bolus doses depending on concomitant use of opioids, patient age, ASA status and weight,  details of the 
remimazolam dosing guidelines were presented in section 4.2 of the SmPC and instructions for use to 
facilitate ease of access to this important information by HCPs when using this product. Furthermore, 
information on the effects of concomitant use of opioids/CNS depressants/alcohol was provided to HCPs 
within this section of the PL, following the information on the training requirements for the practitioner 
responsible for administering the product and monitoring the patient, to outline that concomitant use of 
remimazolam and opioids/CNS depressants/alcohol may increase the sedative effects of remimazolam, 
which may result in profound sedation and respiratory depression, and that patients should be monitored 
closely during and after the procedure for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. 
Excipients (dextran and lactose) 
Hypersensitivity reactions were observed during the clinical development programme. According to the 
the applicant, the addition of dextran 40 in combination with lactose to the remimazolam formulation 
allows  for  the  acceleration  of  the  freeze-drying  cycle  in  the  production  process  of  the  freeze-dried 
product. Calculations were done based on proposed use in general anaesthesia setting and according to 
the  applicant,  dexran  40  is  highly  unlikely  to  pose  a  hazard  to  human  health  at  the  exposure  level 
investigated  in  the  proposed  indication,  and  the  issue  was  further  discussed  upon  request,  with  the 
conclusion that routine PhV measures will be sufficient for safety monitorisation. The applicant has done 
comprehensive  assessment  regarding  above  mentioned  effects  of  dextran  on  coagulation  and  renal 
function. It is agreed that there is no obvious risk on coagulation and renal function with doses proposed 
in the procedural sedation setting.

Drug-drug interactions 
Drug-drug  interactions  and  the  potential  impact  with  antiepileptics  and  antidepressants  have  been 
elucidated during the assessment. Although some differences were suspected to be clinically relevant 
from  the  raw  data,  the  magnitude  of  differences  regarding  antiepileptics  or  antidepressants  were  not 
relevant with respect to impact on O2 saturation, use of fentanyl or time to onset and offset of sedation. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Safety profile of remimazolam seems broadly comparable to the safety profile of midazolam. Observed 
TEAEs indicate remimazolam’s potential for haemodynamic and respiratory disturbances, gastrointestinal 
disorders,  dizziness  and  pyrexia.  Observed  AEs  seem  manageable,  but  the  speed  of  occurrence  is  of 
concern.  Based  on  different  PD  profile  compared  to  midazolam  and  medication  error  potential,  the 
conditions  for  use  should  include  administration  of  remimazolam  only  by  clinicians  experienced  in 
sedation  and  proper  precautionary  measures  are  needed.  Significant  drawback  of  medicinal  product 
formulation are excipients that poses risk of anaphylactic/ anaphylactoid reactions. 
The following main warning and precautions have been included in the SmPC: there should be a dedicated 
clinician to sedation other than the practitioner, and the CNS and respiratory depression may occur. 
Interactions with chronic concomitant medication and co-administration of opioids need to be taken into 
account.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.0 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle 
with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 23 January 2020. The new EURD list entry will therefore 
use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of remimazolam with active substances contained in authorised 
medicinal products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, mixture 
of isomers, complex or derivative of any of them.  
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Labelling exemptions 
A request to omit certain particulars from the labelling as per Art.63.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC has been 
submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group for the following reasons: 
Based on the fact that the product is reconstituted and then injected intravenously and will only be used 
by HCPs in a clinical setting and considering the small size of the vial and associated lack of space, the 
QRD group accepted the request to use minimum particulars on the 12 ml vial label. 
2.10.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Byfavo (remimazolam) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains new active substance.  
Therefore. the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new

safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The proposed indication is: “Remimazolam is indicated in adults for procedural sedation.” 
Procedural  sedation  may  be  used  for  any  unpleasant  medical  procedure  in  which  a  patient's  pain  or 
anxiety is pronounced and may interfere with performance. Sedatives don’t have analgesic properties; 
therefore they are commonly used in combination with opioids. The applicant has chosen colonoscopy and 
bronchoscopy as model procedures in phase 3 trials. 
Aim of therapy is to enable performance of the procedure. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Available medicinal products for procedural sedation are the benzodiazepine midazolam and the general 
anaesthetic propofol in combination with opioids. 
Propofol is a lipophilic intravenous general anaesthetic with a short onset of action (9 to 51 seconds) and 
a  short  half-life,  which  allows  rapid  recovery  from  sedation.  Disadvantages  of  propofol  include  its 
potential for respiratory depression with loss of airway potency, common and profound hypotension and 
a  narrow  therapeutic  index  which  can  lead  to  involuntary  overdosing.  The  administration  of  propofol 
requires a physician trained in the administration of general anaesthesia or management in an intensive 
care unit. 
Among  benzodiazepines,  midazolam  is  the  most  commonly  used  agent  for  procedural  sedation. 
Disadvantage  of  benzodiazepines  is  their  long  half-life;  even  midazolam  as  the  shortest  acting 
benzodiazepine on the market has a half-life of 1-3 hours. Other disadvantages include a possibility for 
respiratory depression and prolonged sedation/drowsiness. The availability of an antidote (flumazenil) is 
an advantage. The administration of midazolam requires the presence of a dedicated person trained in the 
recognition and management of expected adverse events including respiratory and cardiac resuscitation. 
Overall, midazolam is a satisfactory benzodiazepine for procedural sedation and no unmet medical need 
has been identified. However, patients and clinicians would benefit from a benzodiazepine with a more 
rapid recovery and a better safety profile. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main evidence of efficacy submitted comes from three randomised, controlled, Phase 3 trials in the 
indication of procedural sedation. Fentanyl was co-administered for analgesia in these three trials. All 
studies were conducted in adult patients.  
Phase  3  Studies  CNS7056-006  and  CNS7056-008  are  designated  as  pivotal,  while  Study 
CNS7056-015 is designated as supportive.  
Assessment report  
EMA/160756/2021  
Page 121/132 
 
 
 
Phase 2b trial CNS7056-004 is designated as a dose-finding trial. However, since it is the only trial that 
provided  head-to-head  comparison  with  blinded  midazolam,  it  is  briefly  mentioned  here  for 
contextualisation purposes.  
Study CNS7056-006 was a phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of remimazolam compared 
to double-blind placebo and open-label midazolam in patients undergoing colonoscopy. Participants were 
randomised to receive one of the following 3 treatments: remimazolam 5mg initial dose+2.5mg top-ups; 
matching placebo or open-label midazolam 1.75mg initial dose+1mg top-ups. Fentanyl was administered 
for analgesia (initially 75μg, reduced to 50μg in protocol amendment 4; top-ups were allowed). The initial 
dose of midazolam is slightly lower than EU midazolam. The ITT set was used for the primary efficacy 
analysis  and  consisted  of  all  randomised  patients:  298  in  remimazolam;  60  in  placebo  and  103  in 
midazolam arms.  
Study CNS7056-008 was a phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of remimazolam compared 
to double-blind placebo and open-label midazolam in patients undergoing flexible bronchoscopy. Patients 
were randomised to receive remimazolam, placebo or midazolam in the same doses as in study 006. 
Fentanyl was administered for analgesia (initially 75 μg, later amended to 25 to 50 μg; top-ups were 
allowed). The ITT set was used for the primary efficacy analysis and consisted of all randomised patients: 
310 in remimazolam, 63 in placebo and 73 in midazolam.  
Study  CNS7056-015  was  a  phase  3  study  evaluating  primarily  safety  of  remimazolam  compared  to 
double-blind  placebo  and  open-label  midazolam  in  ASA  III  and  IV  patients  undergoing  colonoscopy. 
Patients were randomised into one of three groups: remimazolam 2.5-5mg initial dose plus 1.25-2.5mg 
top-up  doses;  placebo  or  midazolam  1.0mg  plus  0.5mg  top-up  doses.  Fentanyl  was  administered  for 
analgesia (up to 50 μg; top-ups were allowed). The ITT set included 32 patients in remimazolam, 16 in 
placebo and 31 in midazolam arms.  
Study CNS7056-004 was a Phase 2b dose-finding study evaluating safety and efficacy of multiple doses 
of remimazolam compared to midazolam in patients undergoing colonoscopy. Patients were randomised 
to  receive  1  of  the  4  treatments:  remimazolam  8mg  initial  dose+3  mg  top-ups  (40  patients); 
remimazolam  7mg  initial+2  mg  top-ups  (40  patients);  remimazolam  5mg  initial+3  mg  top-ups  (41 
patients);  or  the  comparator  midazolam  2.5  mg  initial+1  mg  top-ups  (41  patients).  Fentanyl  was 
administered  for  analgesia  (100  μg  initially  with  top-ups  allowed).  This  is  the  only  clinical  study  in 
procedural  sedation  where  remimazolam  and  midazolam  were  both  administered  in  a  blinded  fashion 
which provides head-to-head comparison data. 
Rescue strategies were defined – rescue analgesia consisted of additional doses of fentanyl and rescue 
sedation consisted of midazolam only (except in study 004, where other sedatives could have been used 
as rescue). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Success  of  procedure  is  the  primary  efficacy  outcome  in  pivotal  trials.  Success  of  procedure  is  a 
composite  primary  outcome  and  responders  in  phase  3  trials  were  patients  who  completed  the 
procedure, did not require alternative sedatives and with a maximum of remimazolam 5 top-ups in any 15 
minutes window (for midazolam: maximum 3 top-ups within any 12 min window).  
Success of procedure was observed in 91.3%, 80.6% and 84.4% in patients treated with remimazolam 
in  studies  006,  008  and  015  respectively.  This  is  to  be  compared  with  1.7%,  4.8%  and  0%  patients 
treated with placebo in studies 006, 008 and 015 respectively. In open-label midazolam arm, treatment 
success was recorded in 25.2%, 32.9% and 12.9% patients in studies 006, 008 and 015, respectively. 
The non-response was mainly due to need for rescue sedative medication. 
Assessment report  
EMA/160756/2021  
Page 122/132 
 
 
 
The above stated results in phase 3 trials translate into difference in treatment success rates between 
remimazolam  and  placebo  of  89.6%  (95%  CI:  85%,  94.2%;  p-value  <0.0001)  and  75.9%  (95%  CI: 
69%, 82.8%; p-value <0.0001) in studies 006 and 008, respectively. The difference in treatment success 
rates  between  remimazolam  and  midazolam  were  66%  (95%  CI:  57%,  75%)  and  47.8%  (95%CI: 
36.1%, 59.4%) in trial 006 and 008, respectively. Significance levels for comparison of remimazolam and 
midazolam were not obtained since midazolam was open-label and these results were exploratory. 
For contextualisation purposes, the results for the primary outcome success of procedure from phase 2b 
Study 004 (comparison of blinded remimazolam vs. blinded midazolam) can be used. Responders were 
defined as patients with MOAA/S≤ 4 on 3 consecutive measurements taken every minute who completed 
the  procedure,  did  not  require  alternative  sedative  nor  manual/mechanical  ventilation.  Success  of 
procedure  in  Study  004  was  observed  in  92.5%  of  patients  (remimazolam  dose  8.0mg  initial/3.0  mg 
top-ups);  95%  (remimazolam  7.0mg/2.0mg)  and  97.5%  (remimazolam  5.0mg/3.0mg).  This  is  to  be 
compared  with  75%  of  patients  treated  with  midazolam.  Pairwise  comparison  to  midazolam  was 
performed  and  exploratory  p-values  obtained:  0.066  (for  remi  8.0mg/3.0mg);  0.025  (for  remi 
7.0/2.0mg) and 0.007 (for remi 5.0/3.0mg). 
The main secondary outcomes were time-to-event outcomes aiming to describe the onset and recovery 
profile of remimazolam. These endpoints support the clinical relevance of the primary endpoint.  
Time to peak sedation was reached in 3 minutes (95% CI -,-), 3.5 minutes (95% CI 3.5, 4.0) and 3 
minutes  (95%  CI  3.0,  3.6)  for  patients  treated  with  remimazolam  in  studies  006,  008  and  015, 
respectively.  Time  to  peak  sedation  could  not  be  established  for  placebo  and  for  midazolam  it  was  7 
minutes (95% CI: 7.0,-) in study 008 (could not be established in other two studies). 
Time to fully alert from last dose of study drug was reached in 14 minutes (95% CI: 13.0, 14.0), 11.6 
minutes (95% CI 10.0, 12.8) and 11 minutes (95% CI 8.8, 12.0) in patients receiving remimazolam in 
studies 006, 008 and 015. This is to be compared with 28 minutes (95% CI 24.0, 32.0), 20 minutes (95% 
CI 15.3, 31.0) and 18 minutes (95% CI 14.0, 25.0) in patients receiving placebo in studies 006, 008 and 
015, respectively. In the open-label midazolam arm, this outcome was reached in 24 minutes (95% CI 
22.0, 26.0), 18 minutes (95% CI 15.0, 20.1) and 18.8 minutes (95% CI 15.0, 26.0) in studies 006, 008 
and 015, respectively. 
From the patient’s perspective, time to feeling ‘back to normal’ was 3.2 hours (95% CI 3.0, 3.5) in 
remimazolam group, compared to 5.8 hours (95% CI 4.0, 7.4) in placebo group and 6.1 hours (95% CI 
5.0, 7.2) in midazolam group. Hazard ratio for the comparison of remimazolam vs placebo was 1.751 
(92% CI 1.312, 2.337) and for the comparison of remimazolam vs midazolam 1.775 (95% CI 1.407, 
2.239).  
Sensitivity analysis for the primary outcome based on total fentanyl received and initial fentanyl dose 
showed similar results to those seen in the primary efficacy analysis for remimazolam versus placebo in 
studies  006  and  008.  Sensitivity  analysis  for  remimazolam  versus  midazolam  in  Study  006  obtained 
results similar to those seen in primary analysis.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Midazolam was administered as an open-label study drug in all phase 3 studies. This may have inflated 
the treatment effect of remimazolam. The statistic comparisons with midazolam were exploratory. 
Another issue with midazolam as a comparator in pivotal phase 3 studies 006 and 008 is the suboptimial 
dose  used  (ie.  1.75  mg  as  the  initial dose;  EU  label  midazolam  states  2-2.5mg  as  the  initial  dose in 
procedural sedation). Top-up doses were in line with EU label midazolam (ie. 1mg). Placebo was used as 
a double-blind comparator in pivotal trials and statistical analysis were based on superiority over placebo. 
Assessment report  
EMA/160756/2021  
Page 123/132 
 
 
 
After failure of placebo, rescue midazolam was to be used. This enabled the procedures to be completed 
but uncertainty was introduced since the comparator arm was effectively no longer blinded.  
Sensitivity analysis for the primary outcome based on total fentanyl received and initial fentanyl dose 
for  remimazolam  versus  midazolam  showed  similar  results  to  those  seen  in  primary  efficacy  analysis 
except that the difference in success rates was smaller for the initial fentanyl stratum ≥75 μg (0.0067 
[95%-CI: -0.3244, 0.3377]) in study 008. 
Median  time  to  ready  for  discharge  from  the  end  of  procedure  was  5  minutes  shorter  in 
remimazolam  compared  to  placebo  (with  overlapping  95%  CIs)  and  4  minutes  shorter  compared  to 
midazolam  (with  overlapped  95%  CIs)  in  Study  006.  These  reductions  (in  absolute  terms:  from  49 
minutes in placebo and 48 minutes in midazolam to 44 minutes in remimazolam) are hardly clinically 
relevant. In Study 008 time was reached 6 minutes earlier for remimazolam compared to midazolam 
(with overlapping 95% CIs). This is not clinically relevant (in absolute terms: from 66 minutes in placebo 
to 60 minutes in remimazolam). On the other hand, time to discharge in remimiazolam group was 21 
minutes shorter compared to placebo and this is clinically relevant. 
Median  time  to  ready  for  discharge  from  the  last  dose  of  study  drug  was  6  minutes  shorter  in 
remimazolam compared to midazolam with overlapping 95% CIs in Study 006 (reduction from 57 to 51 
minute). In study 008, this outcome was also reached 6 minutes earlier in remimazolam compared to 
midazolam  with  overlapping  95%  CIs  (reduction  from  70  to  64  minutes).  These  reductions  are  not 
clinically  relevant.  On the other  hand,  time to discharge  from  last  dose  in  remimazolam  compared to 
placebo was 9 and 19 minutes shorter (95% CIs do not overlap) in studies 006 and 008, respectively, and 
this is clinically relevant.   
From the patient’s perspective, time to feeling ‘back to normal’ in Study 008 was 6.7 hours (95% CI 
5.7, 8.5) in remimazolam arm compared to 15.6 hours (95% CI 7.7, 20.3) in placebo and 7.4 hours (95% 
CI 5.2, 16.8) in midazolam arm. Hazard ratio for the comparison of remimazolam versus placebo was 
1.277 (95%-CI: 0.940, 1.734) and was not statistically significant (P = 0.1165). Hazard ratio for the 
comparison remimazolam versus midazolam was 0.916 (95%-CI: 0.690, 1.216). These results are not 
statistically significant nor clinically relevant. 
The final indication –procedural sedation - is broad. Due to its rapid onset of action and a favourable 
recovery profile, it can be expected that remimazolam will be of interest for a variety of procedures, and 
not just the  ones  studied.  However,  procedures  in the  pivotal trials  were  of  relatively  short  duration; 
majority of them lasted. Efficacy and safety data from pivotal studies in procedural sedation has been 
analysed in 2 categories: procedures lasting for 30 minutes of less and procedures lasting for more than 
30 minutes. This analysis suggests that patients undergoing procedures of short duration can be expected 
to have more benefit of remimazolam treatment compared to patients undergoing procedures of longer ≥
30 min duration. Consequently, the results were presented in the SmPC separately for procedures shorter 
and longer than 30min in order to inform the prescribers of this difference.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Overall 750 subjects received remimazolam in procedural sedation active and placebo controlled clinical 
trials clinical trials. 
Assessment report  
EMA/160756/2021

Of the 750 subjects in Total Remimazolam treatment group, 73.7% of subjects had a TEAE, and 32.7% of 
subjects  had  a  TEAE  related  to  study  drug  compared  to  79.3%  and  40.1%  in  Total  Midazolam  group 
respectively. 17 subjects (2.3%) in Total Remimazolam group had an SAE compared to 1 subject (0.4%) 
in Total Midazolam group. 
The most common (>5%) events in Total Remimazolam group by PT were (not all listed): hypotension 
(31.3%),  hypertension  (21.7%),  hypoxia  (9.2%),  bradycardia  (6.5%),  and  respiratory  rate  increased 
(5.7%).  Among  TEAEs  with  incidence  ≥1%  there  are  some  observed  with  higher  incidence  in  Total 
Remimazolam group by PT than Total Midazolam group (not all listed): diastolic hypertension (14.5% 
vs  10.3%),  systolic  hypertension  (11.3%  vs  9.5%),  hypoxia  (9.2%  vs  5.8%),  respiratory  rate 
increased (5.7% vs 4.1%), nausea (3.2% vs 2.1%). 
Significantly higher incidence of undesirable deep sedation (MOAA/S 0-1) in Total Remimazolam group 
compared  to  Total  Midazolam  and  Placebo  (rescue  midazolam)  groups  (27.7%  vs  15.7%  and  11.9% 
respectively). When analysing frequencies of MOAA/S scores 0-1 in ISS group A1,  notable differences are 
seen from minute 1 post-dose between remimazolam and midazolam: 7.6% vs 0.9% in minute 1; 14.6% 
vs 1.6% in minute 2; 8.3% vs 0.8% in minute 5; 7.0% vs 1.2% in minute 7; 7.9% vs 4.2% in minute 10; 
6.4% vs 4.2% in minute 12; 5.1% vs 3.8% in minute 15.  
In study 006, a higher relative frequency of deep sedation (MOAA/S score 0, equivalent to general 
anaesthesia)  was  seen  at  all  timepoints  for  remimazolam  (ranging  from  1.2%  to  6.4%)  compared  to 
placebo (0%) and midazolam (ranging from 0% to 2%), except for the last timepoint that reported 1 
patient (1%) in midazolam with score 0 compared to no patients (0%) in other treatment arms with score 
0. A similar trend was observed in study 008 with a higher frequency of MOAA/S scores 0 observed with 
remimazolam for all except the last two timepoints. 
Drowsiness was evaluated with VAS, where a larger number denotes more severe drowsiness. In study 
006, the highest mean VAS score for remimazolam (86.9) was larger compared to highest VAS score for 
placebo  and  midazolam  (82.2  and  78.5,  respectively).  Similarly,  in  Study  008  the  highest  mean  VAS 
score  for  remimazolam  (85.6)  was  larger  compared  to  highest  VAS  score  for  placebo  and  midazolam 
(81.4 and 72.1, respectively). 
Hypersensitivity events were reported in 4 remimazolam subjects (0.5%), 0 midazolam, and 1 (0.7%) 
placebo  subjects.  SMQ  hypersensitivity  consists  of  2  cases  of  bronchospasm  (0.3%),  1  case  of 
anaphylactic reaction (0.1%) and 1 case of periorbital oedema (0.1%). 
Some adverse events were more frequently observed in  elderly: AEs belonging to the SOC Vascular 
disorders (53.7% vs 75.1% vs 82.0% in groups <65 years, 65-74 years, ≥75 years respectively) and 
hypoxia (5.1% vs 17.2% vs 26.0% in groups <65 years, 65-74 years, ≥75 years respectively).  
Patients with severe hepatic impairment have longer half-life, larger total exposure and longer time to 
recovery with remimazolam compared to healthy subjects. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Several uncertainties about unfavourable effects have been identified: 
The excipients used in remimazolam drug product are dextran and lactose. Data on possible clinical 
scenarios with repeated  remimazolam  administrations have not been sufficiently discussed. Local 
tolerance  issues  are  known  for  parenteral  benzodiazepines,  i.e.  thrombophlebitic  reactions  to 
benzodiazepines,  with  diazepam  and  midazolam  as  notable  examples.  Non-clinical  data  revealed  the 
vascular lesions at higher remimazolam concentrations. 
Furthermore, some limitations have been identified: 
Assessment report  
EMA/160756/2021  
Page 125/132 
 
 
 
Depth of sedation is unpredictable and there are interindividual  variabilities in the level of sedation 
observed.  
Rare adverse events could not be revealed during the clinical development due to the database size.

1  Success  of  procedure  in  Study  CNS7056-004:  Responders  were  defined  as  patients  with  MOAA/S≤  4  on  3  consecutive 
measurements taken every minute who completed the procedure, did not require alternative sedative nor manual/mechanical 
ventilation 
2 Success of procedure in Studies CNS7056-006, CNS7056-008 and CNS7056-015: responders were patients who completed the 
procedure, did not require alternative sedatives and with a maximum of remimazolam 5 top-ups in any 15 minutes window (for 
midazolam: maximum 3 top-ups within any 12 min window). 
3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
A consistently higher success rate (the composite primary endpoint) was observed with remimazolam 
compared to placebo and midazolam. A non-responder is a patient requiring more frequent dosing of the 
Investigational product, or rescue sedative. However, more frequent dosing may not be envisioned as a 
failure by clinicians, if adequate sedation is achieved in the end. The clinical relevance is better illustrated 
by secondary endpoints on onset and recovery. The vast majority of procedures in all treatment arms was 
finished (ie. procedure completed). 
In all phase 3 trials, failing the primary outcome is driven by the need for rescue sedatives/too many 
doses  of  study  drug,  while  the  percentage  of  patients  who  failed  because  the  procedure  was  not 
completed is 2.2%, 3.8% and 2.5% in studies 006, 008 and 015. 
Results of phase 3 procedural sedation trials show a faster onset of action of remimazolam compared 
to placebo and midazolam (11-15 minutes faster than the comparators, depending on the study), and this 
is  viewed  as  clinically  relevant.  Peak  sedation  is  achieved  faster  with  remimazolam  (in  3  minutes) 
compared to midazolam (in 7 minutes, could be established only in 1 study). Time to peak sedation could 
not be established for placebo. Accordingly, a conclusion can be made of a faster onset of sedation for 
midazolam vs both comparators. 
Regarding  the  recovery  profile,  time  to  fully  alert  from  the  last  dose  of  study  drug  shorter  for 
remimazolam compared to midazolam (6-10 minutes shorter) and compared to placebo (7-14 minutes). 
Time to ready for discharge from the last dose of study drug (evaluated in studies 006 and 008) is 
also shorter for remimazolam, but these results are not as robust as those seen for time to fully alert from 
last dose of study drug. Namely, time to discharge from last dose is 5-6 minutes shorter for remimazolam 
compared to midazolam, which is not very clinically relevant; however, it is 9-28 minutes shorter for 
Assessment report  
EMA/160756/2021  
Page 128/132 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
remimazolam  compared  to  placebo.  Similar  results  with  overlapping  95%  CI  are  seen  for  time  to 
discharge from the end of procedure. According to patients themselves, drowsiness with remimazolam 
was more severe compared to midazolam. Also according to patients, time to feeling back to normal 
yielded somewhat mixed results – although shorter for remimazolam compared to mida and placebo, the 
difference was clinically relevant (around 3 hours difference for both remi vs. placebo and remi vs.mida) 
in study 006 but it wasn’t clinically relevant for remi vs.mida in study 008.  
Taken together, data demonstrates faster onset of action of remimazolam vs placebo and midazolam and 
deeper sedation achieved with remimazolam vs placebo and midazolam. Data also demonstrates a faster 
recovery, although the effect size is considered to be limited.   
There  were  several  methodological  flaws  that  may  have  inflated  the  treatment  effect.  The  active 
comparator  midazolam was administered in an open-label fashion in pivotal trials and ‘success’ of 
procedure with midazolam was quite small in itself. Midazolam was also subdosed in the pivotal trials. On 
the other hand, in the only trial where midazolam was administered in a double-blinded fashion and an 
adequate  initial  dose  (study  004),  success  of  procedure  with  midazolam  (75%)  was  much  closer  to 
success of procedure with remimazolam (92-97%) and also much higher that success of procedure with 
midazolam seen in pivotal trials (13-33%).  
Placebo  is  used  as  a  double-blind  comparator  in  pivotal  trials.  After  failure  of  placebo  (which 
understandably happened in almost all placebo cases), rescue midazolam was used, which de facto led to 
unblinding of that study arm adding to uncertainty about the internal validity of the trial. 
It is important to note that all comparisons with midazolam and all secondary outcomes are to be viewed 
as exploratory. 
Procedures  selected  for  phase  3  clinical  trials  for  the  broad  indication  of  procedural  sedation  are 
colonoscopy and bronchoscopy. Due to its rapid onset of action and a favourable recovery profile, it can 
be expected that remimazolam will be of interest for a variety of procedures, and not just the common 
and pre-scheduled colonoscopies/bronschoscopies. Most prominent unfavourable effect is undesirable 
deep sedation (MOAA/S 0-1, level equal to general anaesthesia) achieved fast after administration of 
remimazolam.  Undesirable  deep  sedation  is  observed  in  significantly  higher  incidence  in  Total 
Remimazolam group compared to midazolam group between minute 1 and minute 15 post-dose. The 
pharmacodynamics  differences  between  remimazolam  and  midazolam,  and interindividual  variabilities 
are in the clinical development programme shown to be unexpected  by  the  clinicians. Considering 
different pharmacodynamics properties of remimazolam and midazolam, an appropriate wording in SmPC 
was introduced. 
The CNS and ventilation depression of RMZ has been more thoroughly discussed. RMZ patients have 
developed more frequently unwanted deeper sedation and respiratory SAEs that did not occur in MDZ 
treated patients. Significantly, clinicians did not relate the respiratory SAEs to sedation. It is shown that 
overshooting CNS depression does occur with remimazolam, with 18% of pts reaching MOAA/S <=1, and 
almost 8% having respiratory disorders identified as SAE. However, only 10.6% did show respiratory rate 
decrease, and all have been identified as having respiratory depression or hypoxia by clinicians, with none 
reported as SAE. It can be admitted that all events have been adequately dealt within a CT setting, but the 
applicant might have discussed further the extrapolation to the real world. 
Patients ≥ 65 years of age and/or with ASA-PS III-IV  
The applicant conducted dedicated study 015 which included patients with ASA-PS III-IV. Results show 
effectiveness of remimazolam similar to those shown in studies 006 and 008. However, the number of 
exposed patients is limited.  
Assessment report  
EMA/160756/2021  
Page 129/132 
 
 
 
Regarding safety data obtained for the elderly patients, adverse events pertaining to the SOC Vascular 
disorders and hypoxia were observed more frequently in elderly, especially in ≥75 years group. Similarly, 
in patients with ASA-PS III-IV (study 015) observed AEs pertained to the SOC Vascular disorders and SOC 
Respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders.  Caution  is  needed,  but  adverse  events  seem 
manageable. Furthermore, it is expected that in clinical practice special care is given to ASA-PS III-IV and 
elderly patients and they are probably candidates for in-hospital procedures in most clinical practices in 
the EU. 
The sedative effects of remimazolam can be reversed with the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil. 
Since remimazolam and flumazenil have comparable elimination half-lives, the risk of re-sedation is low 
in comparison with other benzodiazepines with longer t1/2 and/or pharmacologically active metabolites 
(e.g. midazolam). 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Success  of  procedure  was  higher  with  remimazolam  compared  to  placebo  in  the  pivotal  trials.  These 
results  were  statistically  significant  and  clinically  relevant.  Comparison  with  midazolam  also  favoured 
remimazolam,  although  the  effect  is  smaller.  However,  more  frequent  dosing  (or  a  need  for  rescue 
sedatives) that led to declaring treatment failure in pivotal studies may not be envisioned as a failure by 
clinicians, if adequate sedation is achieved in the end. 
The  main  benefit  of  remimazolam  is  its  fast  onset  of  action  that  gives  the  opportunity  to  start  the 
procedure faster than if midazolam was used. Patients who receive remimazolam are fully alert and able 
to  be  discharged  sooner  than  patients  receiving  midazolam  and  placebo  although  these  results  are 
somewhat  less  robust  than  the  ones  pertaining  to  the  onset  profile  of  remimazolam.  More  severe 
drowsiness was noted for remimazolam and the incidence of deep sedation (even the sedation level of 
general anaesthesia) is consistently higher for remimazolam compared to midazolam and placebo. More 
hypoxia was noted for remimazolam and in general the respiratory profile may be more of an issue with 
remimazolam compared to midazolam.  
In  general,  all  of  the  above  can  be  managed  by  a  separate  clinician  (not  performing  the  procedure), 
trained in sedation and properly informed of the effects of remimazolam, and an antidote is available in 
case of overdose.

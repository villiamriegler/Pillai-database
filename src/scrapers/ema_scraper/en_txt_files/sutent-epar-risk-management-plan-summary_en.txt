PART VI. SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
Summary of risk management plan for Sutent (Sunitinib malate) 
This is a summary of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for Sutent.  The RMP details important 
risks of Sutent, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained 
about Sutent's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Sutent's SmPC and its PL give essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on 
how Sutent should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Sutent should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Sutent's 
RMP. 
I. The Medicine and What It Is Used For 
Sutent is authorised for the treatment of unresectable and/or metastatic malignant GIST, 
advanced RCC/mRCC and unresectable or metastatic, well-differentiated pNET with disease 
progression in adults (see SmPC for the full indication).  It contains sunitinib malate as the active 
substance and it is given by oral route of administration. 
Further information about the evaluation of Sutent’s benefits can be found in Sutent’s EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website under the medicine’s 
webpage:  
http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/human/medicines/000687/huma
n_med_001069.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac058001d124 (accessed September 2018). 
II. Risks Associated With the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further Characterise 
the Risks 
Important risks of sunitinib together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about sunitinib’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly; 
Page 1 
 
 
 
 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the public (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of sunitinib is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A. List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of sunitinib are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of sunitinib.  Potential risks are concerns for which 
an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers 
to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected.

Important Identified Risk: Cardiotoxicity 
Torsade de pointes 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Evidence Source: 
Non-clinical and company-sponsored clinical studies, Spontaneous reports 
Strength of Evidence: 
In non-clinical studies QT prolongation was noted with dose levels 
corresponding to greater than the recommended doses used in humans.  QT 
prolongation may lead to arrhythmias such as Torsade de pointes. 
Page 2 
 
 
 
 
Table 2.  Summary of Important Identified Risks 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
No risk factors have been identified.  Theoretically patients who have baseline 
QT interval prolongation, cardiac disease, or receive other medicines that cause 
QT interval prolongation or inhibit the metabolism of sunitinib may be at 
increased risk. 
Risk minimisation 
measures 
There are many factors that can increase the QT interval, such as metabolic and 
cardiac disease and gender (women tend to have a longer QT interval).  A life-
threatening complication of QT interval prolongation is torsade de pointes, a 
ventricular tachycardia that is characterised by QRS complexes of changing 
amplitude that appear to twist around the isoelectric line and occur at rates of 
200 to 250/min.

measures 
Strength of Evidence: 
Left ventricular dysfunction/Heart failure has been reported with other TKIs and  
has been reported in sunitinib clinical trials and in the post-marketing setting. 
No risk factors have been identified.  It is theoretically possible that patients with 
a history of cardiac disease, cardiac risk factors, or prior therapy with cardiotoxic 
drugs have a higher risk developing ventricular dysfunction while receiving 
sunitinib.

Strength of Evidence: 
Pericardial events have been reported in clinical trials and in the post-marketing 
setting. 
No risk factors have been identified for pericardial effusion associated with 
sunitinib treatment.  Patients with pericardial metastases are likely to have a 
higher risk of developing pericardial effusion.

Cardiac ischemic events have been reported with other TKIs, and can be of

reported in clinical trials and in the post-marketing setting.   
Increasing age, smoking, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, obesity, 
family history of coronary artery disease, polycythemia, and a history of 
coronary artery disease are other recognised predisposing risk factors for cardiac 
ischaemic events.

Strength of Evidence: 
The majority of patients who developed ONJ during sunitinib treatment had 
received prior or concomitant treatment with IV bisphosphonates, for which ONJ 
is an identified risk. 
Risk factors for ONJ in the general population include bisphosphonates, 
diabetes, alcoholism, cigarette smoking, obesity, hyperlipidemia, pancreatitis, 
chemotherapy with L-asparaginase, radiotherapy, receipt of parenteral steroids, 
jaw trauma, and dental procedures.

Important Identified Risk: Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Evidence Source: 
Company-sponsored clinical studies, Spontaneous reports 
Strength of Evidence: 
SCARs (SJS and EM) are listed adverse drug reactions of sorafenib, a tyrosine 
kinase inhibitor that inhibits some of the same tyrosine kinases as sunitinib.  It is 
unknown whether inhibition of tyrosine kinases expressed in the skin could 
result in these effects.

Triggering causes of EM in the general population may include viral illness, 
other infections, or drug use.  When the cause of SJS or TEN is identified, it is 
most frequently use of a drug; other causes or contributory factors include 
infections, eg, HIV, sepsis, also lymphoma, graft-versus-host disease, 
vaccination and radiation therapy.

measures 
Strength of Evidence: 
Most cases of renal failure in the clinical trierroral and safety database involved 
known risk factors which may have contributed to the development of renal 
failure. 
Risk factors identified for renal failure in the general population include 
advanced age; chronic infection; diabetes; hypertension; heart failure; immune 
disorders, such as lupus, IgA nephropathy and scleroderma; hepatic disease; 
prostate gland enlargement; and bladder outlet obstruction.  Risk factors for 
prerenal acute renal failure include dehydration, heart failure, sepsis, and severe 
blood loss.  Most cases in the clinical trial and safety database involved 
dehydration events such as nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea, and poor oral intake.

Strength of Evidence: 
Pre-clinical carcinogenicity study and spontaneous reports of second primary

There is accumulating evidence that survivors of a primary malignancy are at an 
increased risk of developing a second primary malignancy.  The risk of 
developing subsequent multiple primary cancers varies from 1% for an initial 
liver cancer primary diagnosis to 16% for initial bladder cancer primaries. The 
observed documented association between the renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and 
development of second primary malignancies in the epidemiologic literature 
dates back to the 1980s. Second primary malignancies that have been most 
frequently associated with RCC include cancers of the bladder, prostate, colon, 
rectum, lung, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma and melanoma.  There are numerous 
explanations for these associations including the shared risk factors (genetic 
and/or environmental), antecedent cancer therapy and detection bias following 
the diagnosis of the primary cancer.

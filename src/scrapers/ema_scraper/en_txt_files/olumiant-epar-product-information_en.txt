Atopic dermatitis 
Baricitinib is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adult and paediatric 
patients 2 years of age and older who are candidates for systemic therapy. 
Alopecia areata 
Baricitinib is indicated for the treatment of severe alopecia areata in adult patients (see section 5.1). 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
Baricitinib is indicated for the treatment of active juvenile idiopathic arthritis in patients 2 years of age 
and older who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more prior conventional 
synthetic or biologic DMARDs: 
- 
- 
- 
Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyarticular rheumatoid factor positive [RF+] or 
negative [RF-], extended oligoarticular), 
Enthesitis-related arthritis, and 
Juvenile psoriatic arthritis. 
Baricitinib may be used as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration  
Treatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of the 
conditions for which this medicinal product is indicated. 
Posology 
Rheumatoid arthritis 
The recommended dose of baricitinib is 4 mg once daily. A dose of 2 mg once daily is recommended 
for patients at higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), major adverse cardiovascular events 
(MACE) and malignancy, for patients aged ≥ 65 years and for patients with a history of chronic or 
recurrent infections (see section 4.4). A dose of 4 mg once daily may be considered for patients who 
do not achieve adequate control of disease activity with 2 mg once daily dose. A dose of 2 mg once 
daily should be considered for patients who have achieved sustained control of disease activity with 
4 mg once daily and are eligible for dose tapering (see section 5.1). 
Atopic dermatitis 
Adults  
The recommended dose of baricitinib is 4 mg once daily. A dose of 2 mg once daily is recommended 
for patients at higher risk of VTE, MACE and malignancy, for patients aged ≥ 65 years and for 
patients with a history of chronic or recurrent infections (see section 4.4). A dose of 4 mg once daily 
may be considered for patients who do not achieve adequate control of disease activity with 2 mg once 
daily dose. A dose of 2 mg once daily should be considered for patients who have achieved sustained 
control of disease activity with 4 mg once daily and are eligible for dose tapering (see section 5.1). 
Baricitinib can be used with or without topical corticosteroids. The efficacy of baricitinib can be 
enhanced when given with topical corticosteroids (see section 5.1). Topical calcineurin inhibitors may 
be used, but should be reserved for sensitive areas only, such as the face, neck, intertriginous and 
genital areas. 
Consideration should be given to discontinuing treatment in patients who show no evidence of 
therapeutic benefit after 8 weeks of treatment.

Children and adolescents (2 years of age and older) 
The recommended dose of baricitinib is 4 mg once daily for patients weighing 30 kg or more. For 
patients weighing 10 kg to less than 30 kg, the recommended dose is 2 mg once daily. A reduction to 
half the dose should be considered for patients who have achieved sustained control of disease activity 
with the recommended dose and are eligible for dose tapering. 
Baricitinib can be used with or without topical corticosteroids. Topical calcineurin inhibitors may be 
used, but should be reserved for sensitive areas only, such as the face, neck, intertriginous and genital 
areas. 
Consideration should be given to discontinuing treatment in patients who show no evidence of 
therapeutic benefit after 8 weeks of treatment. 
Alopecia areata 
The recommended dose of baricitinib is 4 mg once daily. A dose of 2 mg once daily is recommended 
for patients at higher risk of VTE, MACE and malignancy, for patients aged ≥ 65 years and for 
patients with a history of chronic or recurrent infections (see section 4.4). A dose of 4 mg once daily 
may be considered for patients who do not achieve adequate control of disease activity with 2 mg once 
daily dose. A dose of 2 mg once daily should be considered for patients who have achieved sustained 
control of disease activity with 4 mg once daily and are eligible for dose tapering (see section 5.1). 
Once a stable response has been achieved, it is recommended to continue treatment for at least several 
months, in order to avoid relapse. The benefit-risk of treatment should be re-assessed at regular 
intervals on an individual basis. 
Consideration should be given to discontinuing treatment in patients who show no evidence of 
therapeutic benefit after 36 weeks of treatment. 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (from 2 to less than 18 years of age) 
The recommended dose of baricitinib is 4 mg once daily for patients weighing 30 kg or more. For 
patients weighing 10 kg to less than 30 kg, the recommended dose is 2 mg once daily.  
Consideration should be given to discontinuing treatment in patients who show no evidence of 
therapeutic benefit after 12 weeks of treatment. 
Treatment initiation 
Treatment should not be initiated in patients with an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) less than 
0.5 x 109 cells/L, an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 1 x 109 cells/L, or who have a 
haemoglobin value less than 8 g/dL. Treatment may be initiated once values have improved above 
these limits (see section 4.4). 
Dose reduction 
In patients taking strong Organic Anion Transporter 3 (OAT3) inhibitors such as probenecid, or with 
creatinine clearance between 30 and 60 mL/min the recommended dose should be reduced by half for 
paediatric patients and the recommended dose is 2 mg for adult patients (see section 4.5). 
Special populations 
Renal impairment  
The recommended dose is 2 mg once daily in adult patients with creatinine clearance between 30 and 
60 mL/min. In paediatric patients with creatinine clearance between 30 and 60 mL/min, the 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
recommended dose of baricitinib should be reduced by half. Baricitinib is not recommended for use in 
patients with creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Baricitinib is not 
recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). 
Elderly 
Clinical experience in patients aged ≥ 75 years is very limited.  
Paediatric population (less than 2 years) 
The safety and efficacy of baricitinib in children less than 2 years have not yet been established. No 
data are available. See section 4.2 above for information on posology in children aged 2 years and 
older. 
The safety and efficacy of baricitinib in children less than 18 years of age with alopecia areata have 
not yet been established. No data are available. 
Method of administration  
Oral use. 
Baricitinib is to be taken once daily with or without food and may be taken at any time of the day.  
Alternative administration for children  
For paediatric patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, it may be considered to disperse the 
tablets in water. Only water should be used to disperse the tablet. Only the number of tablets needed 
for the dose should be dispersed. 
If for any reason the entire suspension is not administered, do not disperse and administer another 
tablet but wait until the next scheduled dose. 
For instructions on dispersion of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Pregnancy (see section 4.6). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Baricitinib should only be used if no suitable treatment alternatives are available in patients: 
- 65 years of age and older; 
- patients with history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or other cardiovascular risk factors 
(such as current or past long-time smokers); 
- patients with malignancy risk factors (e.g. current malignancy or history of malignancy) 
Use of JAK inhibitors in patients 65 years of age and older   
Considering the increased risk of MACE, malignancies, serious infections, and all-cause mortality in 
patients 65 years of age and older, as observed in a large randomised study of tofacitinib (another 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
JAK inhibitor), baricitinib should only be used in these patients if no suitable treatment alternatives are 
available.  
Infections 
Serious and sometimes fatal infections have been reported in patients receiving other JAK inhibitors. 
Baricitinib is associated with an increased rate of infections such as upper respiratory tract infections 
compared to placebo (see section 4.8). In rheumatoid arthritis clinical studies, combination with 
methotrexate resulted in increased frequency of infections compared to baricitinib monotherapy.  
The risks and benefits of treatment should be carefully considered prior to initiating baricitinib in 
patients with active, chronic or recurrent infections (see section 4.2). If an infection develops, the 
patient should be monitored carefully and therapy should be temporarily interrupted if the patient is 
not responding to standard therapy. Treatment should not be resumed until the infection resolves.  
As there is a higher incidence of infections in the elderly and in the diabetic populations in general, 
caution should be used when treating the elderly and patients with diabetes. In patients over 65 years 
of age, baricitinib should only be used if no suitable treatment alternatives are available.  
Tuberculosis 
Patients should be screened for tuberculosis (TB) before starting therapy. Baricitinib should not be 
given to patients with active TB. Anti-TB therapy should be considered prior to initiation of treatment 
in patients with previously untreated latent TB. 
Haematological abnormalities 
Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) < 1 x 109 cells/L, Absolute Lymphocyte Count 
(ALC) < 0.5 x 109 cells/L, and haemoglobin < 8 g/dL were reported in clinical trials. 
Treatment should not be initiated, or should be temporarily interrupted, in patients with an 
ANC < 1 x 109 cells/L, ALC < 0.5 x 109 cells/L or haemoglobin < 8 g/dL observed during routine 
patient management (see section 4.2).  
The risk of lymphocytosis is increased in elderly patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Rare cases of 
lymphoproliferative disorders have been reported. 
Viral reactivation 
Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster, herpes simplex), 
were reported in clinical studies (see section 4.8). In rheumatoid arthritis clinical studies, herpes zoster 
was reported more commonly in patients ≥ 65 years of age who had previously been treated with both 
biologic and synthetic conventional DMARDs. If a patient develops herpes zoster, treatment should be 
temporarily interrupted until the episode resolves. 
Screening for viral hepatitis should be performed in accordance with clinical guidelines before starting 
therapy with baricitinib. Patients with evidence of active hepatitis B or C infection were excluded from 
clinical trials. Patients, who were positive for hepatitis C antibody but negative for hepatitis C virus 
RNA, were allowed to participate. Patients with hepatitis B surface antibody and hepatitis B core 
antibody, without hepatitis B surface antigen, were also allowed to participate; such patients should be 
monitored for expression of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA. If HBV DNA is detected, a liver specialist 
should be consulted to determine if treatment interruption is warranted. 
Vaccination 
No data are available on the response to vaccination with live vaccines in patients receiving 
baricitinib. Use with live, attenuated vaccines during or immediately prior to baricitinib therapy is not 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
recommended. Prior to initiating treatment, it is recommended that all patients, and particularly 
paediatric patients, be brought up to date with all immunisations in agreement with current 
immunisation guidelines. 
Lipids 
Dose dependent increases in blood lipid parameters were reported in paediatric and adult patients 
treated with baricitinib (see section 4.8). Elevations in low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol 
decreased to pre-treatment levels in response to statin therapy in adults. In both paediatric and adult 
patients, lipid parameters should be assessed approximately 12 weeks following initiation of therapy 
and thereafter patients should be managed according to international clinical guidelines for 
hyperlipidaemia.  
Hepatic transaminase elevations 
Dose dependent increases in blood alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) 
activity were reported in patients treated with baricitinib (see section 4.8). 
Increases in ALT and AST to ≥ 5 and ≥ 10 x upper limit of normal (ULN) were reported in clinical 
trials. In rheumatoid arthritis clinical studies, combination with methotrexate resulted in increased 
frequency of hepatic transaminase elevations compared with baricitinib monotherapy (see section 4.8). 
If increases in ALT or AST are observed during routine patient management and drug-induced liver 
injury is suspected, treatment should be temporarily interrupted until this diagnosis is excluded. 
Malignancy 
Immunomodulatory medicinal products may increase the risk of malignancies including lymphoma.  
Lymphoma and other malignancies have been reported in patients receiving JAK inhibitors, including 
baricitinib. 
In a large randomized active-controlled study of tofacitinib (another JAK inhibitor) in rheumatoid 
arthritis patients 50 years and older with at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor, a higher rate 
of malignancies, particularly lung cancer, lymphoma and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) was 
observed with tofacitinib compared to TNF inhibitors. 
In patients over 65 years of age, patients who are current or past long-time smokers, or with other 
malignancy risk factors (e.g. current malignancy or history of malignancy) baricitinib should only be 
used if no suitable treatment alternatives are available. 
Periodic skin examination is recommended for all patients, particularly those with risk factors for skin 
cancer. 
Venous thromboembolism 
In a retrospective observational study of baricitinib in rheumatoid arthritis patients, a higher rate of 
venous thromboembolic events (VTE) was observed compared to patients treated with TNF inhibitors 
(see section 4.8). 
In a large randomized active-controlled study of tofacitinib (another JAK inhibitor) in rheumatoid 
arthritis patients 50 years and older with at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor, a dose 
dependent higher rate of VTE including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism 
(PE) was observed with tofacitinib compared to TNF inhibitors. 
In patients with cardiovascular or malignancy risk factors (see also section 4.4 “Major adverse 
cardiovascular events (MACE)” and “Malignancy”) baricitinib should only be used if no suitable 
treatment alternatives are available.  
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In patients with known VTE risk factors other than cardiovascular or malignancy risk factors, 
baricitinib should be used with caution. VTE risk factors other than cardiovascular or malignancy risk 
factors include previous VTE, patients undergoing major surgery, immobilisation, use of combined 
hormonal contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy, and inherited coagulation disorder.  
Patients should be re-evaluated periodically during baricitinib treatment to assess for changes in VTE 
risk. 
Promptly evaluate patients with signs and symptoms of VTE and discontinue baricitinib in patients 
with suspected VTE, regardless of dose or indication. 
Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) 
In a retrospective observational study of baricitinib in rheumatoid arthritis patients, a higher rate of 
MACE was observed compared to patients treated with TNF inhibitors. 
In a large randomized active-controlled study of tofacitinib (another JAK inhibitor) in rheumatoid 
arthritis patients 50 years and older with at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor, a higher rate 
of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as cardiovascular death, non-fatal 
myocardial infarction (MI) and non-fatal stroke ,was observed with tofacitinib (another JAK inhibitor) 
compared with TNF inhibitors. 
Therefore, in patients over 65 years of age, patients who are current or past long-time smokers, and 
patients with history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or other cardiovascular risk factors, 
baricitinib should only be used if no suitable treatment alternatives are available.

Immunosuppressive medicinal products 
Combination with biological DMARDs, biological immunomodulators or other Janus kinase (JAK) 
inhibitors is not recommended, as a risk of additive immunosuppression cannot be excluded. 
In rheumatoid arthritis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis, data concerning use of baricitinib with potent 
immunosuppressive medicinal products other than methotrexate (e.g., azathioprine, tacrolimus, 
ciclosporin) are limited. Caution should be exercised when using such combinations (see section 4.5). 
In atopic dermatitis and alopecia areata, combination with ciclosporin or other potent 
immunosuppressants has not been studied and is not recommended (see section 4.5). 
Hypersensitivity 
In post-marketing experience, cases of hypersensitivity associated with baricitinib administration have 
been reported. If any serious allergic or anaphylactic reaction occurs, treatment should be discontinued 
immediately. 
Diverticulitis 
Cases of diverticulitis and gastrointestinal perforation have been reported in clinical trials and from 
postmarketing sources (see section 4.8). Baricitinib should be used with caution in patients with 
diverticular disease and especially in patients chronically treated with concomitant medicinal products 
associated with an increased risk of diverticulitis: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 
corticosteroids, and opioids. Patients presenting with new onset abdominal signs and symptoms should 
be evaluated promptly for early identification of diverticulitis or gastrointestinal perforation. 
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
“sodium-free”. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
Immunosuppressive medicinal products 
Combination with biological DMARDs, biological immunomodulators or other JAK inhibitors has not 
been studied. In rheumatoid arthritis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis, use of baricitinib with potent 
immunosuppressive medicinal products such as azathioprine, tacrolimus, or ciclosporin was limited in 
clinical studies, and a risk of additive immunosuppression cannot be excluded. In atopic dermatitis and 
alopecia areata, combination with ciclosporin or other potent immunosuppressants has not been 
studied and is not recommended (see section 4.4). 
Potential for other medicinal products to affect the pharmacokinetics of baricitinib 
Transporters 
In vitro, baricitinib is a substrate for organic anionic transporter (OAT)3, P-glycoprotein (Pgp), breast 
cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and multidrug and toxic extrusion protein (MATE)2-K. In a clinical 
pharmacology study, dosing of probenecid (an OAT3 inhibitor with strong inhibition potential) 
resulted in approximately a 2-fold increase in AUC(0-∞) with no change in tmax or Cmax of baricitinib. 
Consequently, in patients taking OAT3 inhibitors with a strong inhibition potential, such as 
probenecid, the recommended dose of baricitinib should be reduced by half (see section 4.2). No 
clinical pharmacology study has been conducted with OAT3 inhibitors with less inhibition potential. 
The prodrug leflunomide rapidly converts to teriflunomide which is a weak OAT3 inhibitor and 
therefore may lead to an increase in baricitinib exposure. Since dedicated interaction studies have not 
been conducted, caution should be used when leflunomide or teriflunomide are given concomitantly 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with baricitinib. Concomitant use of the OAT3 inhibitors ibuprofen and diclofenac may lead to 
increased exposure of baricitinib, however their inhibition potential of OAT3 is less compared to 
probenecid and thus a clinically relevant interaction is not expected. Coadministration of baricitinib 
with ciclosporin (Pgp/BCRP inhibitor) or methotrexate (substrate of several transporters including 
OATP1B1, OAT1, OAT3, BCRP, MRP2, MRP3, and MRP4) resulted in no clinically meaningful 
effects on baricitinib exposure.  
Cytochrome P450 enzymes 
In vitro, baricitinib is a cytochrome P450 enzyme (CYP)3A4 substrate although less than 10 % of the 
dose is metabolised via oxidation. In clinical pharmacology studies, coadministration of baricitinib 
with ketoconazole (strong CYP3A inhibitor) resulted in no clinically meaningful effect on the PK of 
baricitinib. Coadministration of baricitinib with fluconazole (moderate CYP3A/CYP2C19/CYP2C9 
inhibitor) or rifampicin (strong CYP3A inducer) resulted in no clinically meaningful changes to 
baricitinib exposure. 
Gastric pH modifying agents 
Elevating gastric pH with omeprazole had no clinically significant effect on baricitinib exposure.  
Potential for baricitinib to affect the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products 
Transporters 
In vitro, baricitinib is not an inhibitor of OAT1, OAT2, OAT3, organic cationic transporter (OCT) 2, 
OATP1B1, OATP1B3, BCRP, MATE1 and MATE2-K at clinically relevant concentrations. 
Baricitinib may be a clinically relevant inhibitor of OCT1, however there are currently no known 
selective OCT1 substrates for which clinically significant interactions might be predicted. In clinical 
pharmacology studies there were no clinically meaningful effects on exposure when baricitinib was 
coadministered with digoxin (Pgp substrate) or methotrexate (substrate of several transporters). 
Cytochrome P450 enzymes 
In clinical pharmacology studies, coadministration of baricitinib with the CYP3A substrates 
simvastatin, ethinyl oestradiol, or levonorgestrel resulted in no clinically meaningful changes in the 
PK of these medicinal products. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Pregnancy 
The JAK/STAT pathway has been shown to be involved in cell adhesion and cell polarity which can 
affect early embryonic development. There are no adequate data from the use of baricitinib in pregnant 
women. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Baricitinib was 
teratogenic in rats and rabbits. Animal studies indicate that baricitinib may have an adverse effect on 
bone development in utero at higher doses. 
Baricitinib is contraindicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3). Women of childbearing potential 
have to use effective contraception during and for at least 1 week after treatment. If a patient becomes 
pregnant while taking baricitinib the parents should be informed of the potential risk to the foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether baricitinib/metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available 
pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of baricitinib in milk (see 
section 5.3). 
A risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded and baricitinib should not be used during 
breast-feeding. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue 
therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the 
woman. 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fertility 
Studies in animals suggest that treatment with baricitinib has the potential to decrease female fertility 
while on treatment, but there was no effect on male spermatogenesis (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
Baricitinib has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile  
The most commonly reported adverse reactions with baricitinib are increased LDL cholesterol 
(26.0 %), upper respiratory tract infections (16.9 %), headache (5.2 %), herpes simplex (3.2 %), and 
urinary tract infections (2.9 %). Serious pneumonia and serious herpes zoster occurred uncommonly in 
patients with rheumatoid arthritis.  
Tabulated list of adverse reactions  
Frequency estimate: Very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1 000

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Gastrointestinal disorders 
In rheumatoid arthritis clinical studies, in treatment-naïve patients, through 52 weeks, the frequency of 
nausea was greater for the combination treatment of methotrexate and baricitinib (9.3 %) compared to 
methotrexate alone (6.2 %) or baricitinib alone (4.4 %). In the integrated data from rheumatoid 
arthritis, atopic dermatitis and alopecia areata clinical trials, nausea was most frequent during the first 
2 weeks of treatment.  
Cases of abdominal pain were usually mild, transient, not associated with infectious or inflammatory 
gastrointestinal disorders, and did not lead to treatment interruption. 
Infections 
In the integrated data from rheumatoid arthritis, atopic dermatitis and alopecia areata clinical trials, 
most infections were mild to moderate in severity. In studies which included both doses, infections 
were reported in 31.0 %, 25.7 % and 26.7 % of patients in the 4 mg, 2 mg and placebo groups, 
respectively. In rheumatoid arthritis clinical studies, combination with methotrexate resulted in 
increased frequency of infections compared to baricitinib monotherapy. Frequency of herpes zoster 
was common in rheumatoid arthritis, very rare in atopic dermatitis and uncommon in alopecia areata. 
In atopic dermatitis clinical trials, there were less skin infections requiring antibiotic treatment with 
baricitinib than with placebo. 
The incidence of serious infections with baricitinib was similar to placebo. The incidence of serious 
infections remained stable during long term exposure. The overall incidence rate of serious infections 
in the clinical trial programme was 3.2 per 100 patient-years in rheumatoid arthritis, 2.1 in atopic 
dermatitis and 0.8 in alopecia areata. Serious pneumonia and serious herpes zoster occurred 
uncommonly in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.  
Hepatic transaminase elevations 
Dose dependent increases in blood ALT and AST activity were reported in studies extended over 
week 16. Elevations in mean ALT/AST remained stable over time. Most cases of hepatic transaminase 
elevations ≥ 3 x ULN were asymptomatic and transient.  
In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the combination of baricitinib with potentially hepatotoxic 
medicinal products, such as methotrexate, resulted in increased frequency of these elevations.   
Lipid elevations 
In the integrated data from rheumatoid arthritis, atopic dermatitis and alopecia areata clinical trials, 
baricitinib treatment was associated with dose-dependent increases in lipid parameters including total 
cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. There was no change in 
the LDL/HDL ratio. Elevations were observed at 12 weeks and remained stable thereafter at a higher 
value than baseline including in the long-term extension study in rheumatoid arthritis. Mean total and 
LDL cholesterol increased through week 52 in patients with atopic dermatitis and alopecia areata. In 
rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials, baricitinib treatment was associated with dose-dependent increases 
in triglycerides. There was no increase in triglycerides levels in atopic dermatitis and alopecia areata 
clinical trials. 
Elevations in LDL cholesterol decreased to pre-treatment levels in response to statin therapy.  
Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) 
Baricitinib treatment was associated with dose-dependent increases in CPK. Mean CPK was increased 
at week 4 and remained at a higher value than baseline thereafter. Across indications, most cases of 
CPK elevations > 5 x ULN were transient and did not require treatment discontinuation.  
In clinical trials, there were no confirmed cases of rhabdomyolysis. 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Neutropaenia 
Mean neutrophil counts decreased at 4 weeks and remained stable at a lower value than baseline over 
time. There was no clear relationship between neutropaenia and the occurrence of serious infections. 
However, in clinical studies, treatment was interrupted in response to ANC < 1 x 109 cells/L.  
Thrombocytosis 
Dose-dependent increases in mean platelet counts were observed and remained stable at a higher value 
than baseline over time. 
Paediatric population 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
A total of 220 patients from 2 to less than 18 years of age were exposed to any dose of baricitinib in 
the juvenile idiopathic arthritis clinical trial programme, representing 326 patient years’ exposure. 
In paediatric patients treated with baricitinib in the placebo-controlled double-blind randomised 
withdrawal period of the juvenile idiopathic arthritis clinical trial (n=82), headache was very common 
(11 %), neutropenia < 1 000 cells/mm3 was common (2.4 %, one patient) and pulmonary embolism 
was common (1.2 %, one patient). 
Paediatric atopic dermatitis 
The safety assessment in children and adolescents is based on the safety data of the phase III trial 
BREEZE-AD-PEDS in which 466 patients between 2 and 18 years of age received any dose of 
baricitinib. Overall, the safety profile in these patients was comparable to that observed in the adult 
population. Neutropaenia (< 1 x 109 cells/L) was more common (1.7%) compared to adults. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose  
Single doses up to 40 mg and multiple doses of up to 20 mg daily for 10 days have been administered 
to adult patients in clinical trials without dose-limiting toxicity. No specific toxicities were identified. 
Pharmacokinetic data of a single dose of 40 mg in healthy volunteers indicate that more than 90 % of 
the administered dose is expected to be eliminated within 24 hours. In case of an overdose, it is 
recommended that the patient be monitored for signs and symptoms of adverse reactions. Patients who 
develop adverse reactions should receive appropriate treatment.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, selective immunosuppressants, ATC code: 
L04AA37  
Mechanism of action 
Baricitinib is a selective and reversible inhibitor of Janus kinase (JAK)1 and JAK2. In isolated enzyme 
assays, baricitinib inhibited the activities of JAK1, JAK2, Tyrosine Kinase 2 and JAK3 with IC50 
values of 5.9, 5.7, 53 and > 400 nM, respectively. 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Janus kinases (JAKs) are enzymes that transduce intracellular signals from cell surface receptors for a 
number of cytokines and growth factors involved in haematopoiesis, inflammation and immune 
function. Within the intracellular signalling pathway, JAKs phosphorylate and activate signal 
transducers and activators of transcription (STATs), which activate gene expression within the cell. 
Baricitinib modulates these signalling pathways by partially inhibiting JAK1 and JAK2 enzymatic 
activity, thereby reducing the phosphorylation and activation of STATs. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Inhibition of IL-6 induced STAT3 phosphorylation 
Administration of baricitinib resulted in a dose dependent inhibition of IL-6 induced STAT3 
phosphorylation in whole blood from healthy subjects with maximal inhibition observed 2 hours after 
dosing which returned to near baseline by 24 hours.  
Immunoglobulins 
Mean serum IgG, IgM, and IgA values decreased by 12 weeks after starting treatment, and remained 
stable at a lower value than baseline through at least 104 weeks. For most patients, changes in 
immunoglobulins occurred within the normal reference range. 
Lymphocytes 
Mean absolute lymphocyte count increased by 1 week after starting treatment, returned to baseline by 
week 24, and then remained stable through at least 104 weeks. For most patients, changes in 
lymphocyte count occurred within the normal reference range. 
C-reactive protein 
In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, decreases in serum C-reactive protein (CRP) were observed as 
early as 1 week after starting treatment and were maintained throughout dosing. 
Creatinine 
In clinical trials, baricitinib induced a mean increase in serum creatinine levels of 3.8 µmol/L after two 
weeks of treatment, which remained stable thereafter. This may be due to inhibition of creatinine 
secretion by baricitinib in the renal tubules. Consequently, estimates of the glomerular filtration rate 
based on serum creatinine may be slightly reduced, without actual loss of renal function or the 
occurrence of renal adverse reactions. In alopecia areata, mean serum creatinine continued to increase 
up to week 52. In atopic dermatitis and alopecia areata, baricitinib was associated with a decrease in 
cystatin C (also used to estimate glomerular filtration rate) at week 4, with no further decreases 
thereafter. 
In vitro skin models 
In an in vitro human skin model treated with pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL-4, IL-13, IL-31), 
baricitinib reduced epidermal keratinocyte pSTAT3 expression, and increased the expression of 
filaggrin, a protein that plays a role in skin barrier function and in the pathogenesis of atopic 
dermatitis. 
Vaccine study 
The  influence  of  baricitinib  on  the  humoral  response  to  non-live  vaccines  was  evaluated  in 
106 rheumatoid arthritis patients under stable treatment with baricitinib 2 or 4 mg, receiving inactivated 
pneumococcal  or  tetanus  vaccination.  The  majority  of  these  patients  (n = 94)  were  co-treated  with 
methotrexate. For the total population, pneumococcal vaccination resulted in a satisfactory IgG immune 
response in 68 % (95 % CI: 58.4 %, 76.2 %) of the patients. In 43.1 % (95 % CI: 34 %, 52.8 %) of the 
patients, a satisfactory IgG immune response to tetanus vaccination was achieved.

Clinical efficacy 
Rheumatoid arthritis 
The efficacy and safety of baricitinib once daily were assessed in 4 Phase III randomised, 
double-blind, multicentre studies in adult patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis 
diagnosed according to the ACR/EULAR 2010 criteria (Table 3). The presence of at least 6 tender and 
6 swollen joints was required at baseline. All patients who completed these studies were eligible to 
enrol in a long term extension study for up to 7 years additional treatment.

Clinical response 
In all studies, patients treated with baricitinib 4 mg once daily had statistically significantly higher 
ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70 response at 12 weeks compared to placebo, MTX or adalimumab 
(Table 4). Time to onset of efficacy was rapid across measures with significantly greater responses 
seen as early as week 1. Continued, durable response rates were observed, with 
ACR20/50/70 responses maintained for at least 2 years including the long-term extension study. 
Treatment with baricitinib 4 mg, alone or in combination with cDMARDs, resulted in significant 
improvements in all individual ACR components, including tender and swollen joint counts, patient

No relevant differences regarding efficacy and safety were observed in subgroups defined by types of 
concomitant DMARDs used in combination with baricitinib. 
Remission and low disease activity 
A statistically significantly greater proportion of patients treated with baricitinib 4 mg compared to 
placebo or MTX achieved remission (SDAI ≤ 3.3 and CDAI ≤ 2.8) or low disease activity or 
remission (DAS28-ESR or DAS28-hsCRP ≤ 3.2 and DAS28-ESR or DAS28-hsCRP < 2.6), at 
weeks 12 and 24 (Table 4).  
Greater rates of remission compared to placebo were observed as early as week 4. Remission and low 
disease activity rates were maintained for at least 2 years. Data from the long-term extension study up 
to 6 years follow-up indicate durable low disease activity/remission rates.

Radiographic response 
The effect of baricitinib on progression of structural joint damage was evaluated radiographically in 
studies RA-BEGIN, RA-BEAM and RA-BUILD and assessed using the modified Total Sharp Score 
(mTSS) and its components, the erosion score and joint space narrowing score.  
Treatment with baricitinib 4 mg resulted in a statistically significant inhibition of progression of 
structural joint damage (Table 5). Analyses of erosion and joint space narrowing scores were

consistent with the overall scores. The proportion of patients with no radiographic progression (mTSS

Physical function response and health-related outcomes  
Treatment with baricitinib 4 mg, alone or in combination with cDMARDs, resulted in a significant 
improvement in physical function (HAQ-DI) and pain (0-100 visual analogue scale) compared to all 
comparators (placebo, MTX, adalimumab). Improvements were seen as early as week 1 and, in 
studies RA-BEGIN and RA-BEAM, this was maintained for up to 52 weeks.  
In RA-BEAM and RA-BUILD, treatment with baricitinib 4 mg resulted in a significant improvement 
in the mean duration and severity of morning joint stiffness compared to placebo or adalimumab as 
assessed using daily electronic patient diaries. 
In all studies, baricitinib-treated patients reported improvements in patient-reported quality of life, as 
measured by the Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36) Physical Component Score and fatigue, as 
measured by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue score (FACIT-F). 
Baricitinib 4 mg vs. 2 mg 
Differences in efficacy between the 4 mg and the 2 mg doses were most notable in the bDMARD-IR 
population (RA-BEACON), in which statistically significant improvements in the ACR components of 
swollen joint count, tender joint count and ESR were shown for baricitinib 4 mg compared to placebo 
at week 24 but not for baricitinib 2 mg compared to placebo. In addition, for both study RA-BEACON 
and RA-BUILD, onset of efficacy was faster and the effect size was generally larger for the 4 mg dose 
groups compared to 2 mg.  
In a long-term extension study, patients from Studies RA-BEAM, RA-BUILD and RA-BEACON who 
achieved sustained low disease activity or remission (CDAI ≤ 10) after at least 15 months of treatment 
with baricitinib 4 mg once daily were re-randomised 1:1 in a double-blind manner to continue 4 mg 
once daily or reduce dose to 2 mg once daily. The majority of patients maintained low disease activity 
or remission based on CDAI score: 
•  At week 12:  451/498 (91 %) continuing 4 mg vs.  405/498 (81 %) reduced to 2 mg (p ≤ 0.001) 
•  At week 24:  434/498 (87 %) continuing 4 mg vs.  372/498 (75 %) reduced to 2 mg (p ≤ 0.001) 
•  At week 48:  400/498 (80 %) continuing 4 mg vs.  343/498 (69 %) reduced to 2 mg (p ≤ 0.001) 
•  At week 96: 347/494 (70 %) continuing 4 mg vs. 297/496 (60 %) reduced to 2 mg (p ≤ 0.001) 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The majority of patients who lost their low disease activity or remission status after dose reduction 
could regain disease control after the dose was returned to 4 mg. 
Adults with atopic dermatitis 
The efficacy and safety of baricitinib as monotherapy or in combination with topical corticosteroids 
(TCS) were assessed in 3 Phase III randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 16 week studies 
(BREEZE-AD1, -AD2, and -AD7). The studies included 1 568 patients with moderate to severe atopic 
dermatitis defined by Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score ≥ 3, an Eczema Area and Severity 
Index (EASI) score ≥ 16, and a body surface area (BSA) involvement of ≥ 10 %. Eligible patients 
were over 18 years of age and had previous inadequate response or were intolerant to topical 
medicinal products. Patients were permitted to receive rescue treatment (which included topical or 
systemic therapy), at which time they were considered non-responders. At baseline of study BREEZE-
AD7, all patients were on concomitant topical corticosteroids therapy and patients were permitted to 
use topical calcineurin inhibitors. All patients who completed these studies were eligible to enrol in a 
long term extension study (BREEZE AD-3) for up to 2 years of continued treatment.  
The Phase III randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled BREEZE-AD4 study evaluated the 
efficacy of baricitinib in combination with topical corticosteroids over 52 weeks in 463 patients with 
moderate to severe atopic dermatitis with failure, intolerance, or contraindication to oral ciclosporin 
treatment. 
Baseline characteristics 
In the placebo-controlled Phase III studies (BREEZE-AD1, -AD2, -AD7, and -AD4), across all 
treatment groups, 37 % were female, 64 % were Caucasian, 31 % were Asian and 0.6 % were Black, 
and the mean age was 35.6 years. In these studies, 42 % to 51 % of patients had a baseline IGA of 4 
(severe atopic dermatitis), and 54 % to 79 % of patients had received prior systemic treatment for 
atopic dermatitis. The baseline mean EASI score ranged from 29.6 to 33.5, the baseline weekly 
averaged Itch Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) ranged from 6.5 to 7.1, the baseline mean Dermatology 
Life Quality Index (DLQI) ranged from 13.6 to 14.9, and the baseline mean Hospital Anxiety and 
Depression Scale (HADS) Total score ranged from 10.9 to 12.1. 
Clinical response 
16-week monotherapy (BREEZE-AD1, -AD2) and TCS combination (BREEZE-AD7) studies 
A significantly larger proportion of patients randomised to baricitinib 4 mg achieved an IGA 0 or 
1 response (primary outcome), EASI75, or an improvement of ≥ 4 points on the Itch NRS compared to 
placebo at week 16 (Table 6). Figure 1 shows the mean percent change from baseline in EASI up to 
week 16. 
A significantly greater proportion of patients randomised to baricitinib 4 mg achieved a ≥ 4-point 
improvement in the Itch NRS compared to placebo (within the first week of treatment for 
BREEZE-AD1 and AD2, and as early as week 2 for BREEZE-AD7; p < 0.002). 
Treatment effects in subgroups (weight, age, gender, race, disease severity, and previous treatment, 
including immunosuppressants) were consistent with the results in the overall study population.

Maintenance of response  
To evaluate maintenance of response, 1 373 subjects treated with baricitinib for 16 weeks in 
BREEZE-AD1 (N = 541), BREEZE-AD2 (N = 540) and BREEZE-AD7 (N = 292) were eligible to 
enrol in a long term extension study BREEZE-AD3. Data are available up to 68 weeks of cumulative 
treatment for patients from BREEZE-AD1 and BREEZE-AD2, and up to 32 weeks of cumulative

treatment for patients from BREEZE-AD7. Continued response was observed in patients with at least 
some response (IGA 0, 1 or 2) after initiating baricitinib. 
Quality of life/patient-reported outcomes in atopic dermatitis 
In both monotherapy studies (BREEZE-AD1 and BREEZE-AD2) and in the concomitant TCS study 
(BREEZE-AD7), baricitinib 4 mg significantly improved patient-reported outcomes, including itch 
NRS, sleep (ADSS), skin pain (skin pain NRS), quality of life (DLQI) and symptoms of anxiety and 
depression (HADS) that were uncorrected for multiplicity, at 16 weeks compared to placebo (See

Alopecia areata 
The efficacy and safety of baricitinib once daily were assessed in one adaptive Phase II/III study 
(BRAVE-AA1) and one Phase III study (BRAVE-AA2). The Phase III portion of BRAVE-AA1 study 
and the Phase III BRAVE-AA2 study were randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, 36-week 
studies with extension phases up to 200 weeks. In both phase III studies, patients were randomised to 
placebo, 2 mg or 4 mg baricitinib in a 2:2:3 ratio. Eligible patients were adults between 18 years and 
60 years of age for male patients, and between 18 years and 70 years of age for female patients, with a 
current episode of more than 6 months of severe alopecia areata (hair loss encompassing ≥ 50 % of the 
scalp). Patients with a current episode of more than 8 years were not eligible unless episodes of 
regrowth had been observed on the affected areas of the scalp over the past 8 years. The only 
permitted concomitant alopecia areata therapies were finasteride (or other 5 alpha reductase 
inhibitors), oral or topical minoxidil and bimatoprost ophthalmic solution for eyelashes, if at a stable 
dose at study entry. 
Both studies assessed as primary outcome the proportion of subjects who achieved a SALT (Severity 
of Alopecia Tool) score of ≤ 20 (80 % or more scalp coverage with hair) at week 36. Additionally, 
both studies evaluated clinician assessment of eyebrow and eyelash hair loss using a 4-point scale 
(ClinRO Measure for Eyebrow Hair Loss™, ClinRO Measure for Eyelash Hair Loss™). 
Baseline characteristics 
The Phase III portion of BRAVE-AA1 study and the Phase III BRAVE-AA2 study included 
1 200 adult patients. Across all treatment groups, the mean age was 37.5 years, 61 % of patients were 
female. The mean duration of alopecia areata from onset and the mean duration of current episode of 
hair loss were 12.2 and 3.9 years, respectively. The median SALT score across the studies was 96 (this 
equals 96 % scalp hair loss), and approximately 44 % of patients were reported as alopecia universalis. 
Across the studies, 69 % of patients had significant or complete eyebrow hair loss at baseline and 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
58 % had significant or complete eyelash hair loss, as measured by ClinRO Measures for eyebrow and 
eyelash scores of 2 or 3. Approximately 90 % of patients had received at least one treatment for 
alopecia areata at some point before entering the studies, and 50 % at least one systemic 
immunosuppressant. The use of authorised concomitant alopecia areata treatments was reported by 
only 4.3 % of patients during the studies. 
Clinical response 
In both studies, a significantly greater proportion of patients randomised to baricitinib 4 mg once daily 
achieved a SALT ≤ 20 at week 36 compared to placebo, starting as early as week 8 in study 
BRAVE-AA1 and week 12 in study BRAVE-AA2. Consistent efficacy was seen across most of the 
secondary endpoints (Table 9). Figure 2 shows the proportion of patients achieving SALT ≤ 20 up to 
week 36. 
Treatment effects in subgroups (gender, age, weight, eGFR, race, geographic region, disease severity, 
current alopecia areata episode duration) were consistent with the results in the overall study 
population at week 36.

Efficacy up to week 52 
The proportion of patients treated with baricitinib achieving a SALT ≤ 20 continued to increase after 
week 36, reaching 39.0 % of patients on baricitinib 4 mg at week 52. The results for the baseline 
disease severity and episode duration subpopulations at week 52 were consistent with those observed 
at week 36 and with the results in the overall study population. 
Dose tapering substudy 
In the study BRAVE-AA2, patients who had received baricitinib 4 mg once daily since the initial 
randomization and achieved SALT ≤ 20 at week 52 were re-randomised in a double-blind manner to 
continue 4 mg once daily or reduce dose to 2 mg once daily. The results show that 96 % of the patients 
who remained on baricitinib 4 mg and 74 % of the patients who were re-randomised to 
baricitinib 2 mg maintained their response at week 76. 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
The baricitinib clinical development programme for juvenile idiopathic arthritis consisted of one 
completed pivotal Phase III study (JUVE-BASIS) and one ongoing long-term open label safety 
extension study (JUVE-X).  
JUVE-BASIS was a double-blind randomised withdrawal (DBW), up to 44-week placebo-controlled 
study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of baricitinib when administered once daily to patients from 
2 years to less than 18 years of age with juvenile idiopathic arthritis who have had an inadequate 
response or intolerance to treatment with at least 1 conventional synthetic or biologic DMARD. This 
included patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (rheumatoid factor positive or 
rheumatoid factor negative), extended oligoarticular course juvenile idiopathic arthritis, 
enthesitis-related juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and juvenile psoriatic arthritis as defined by the 
International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) criteria. Patients who participated in 
JUVE-BASIS were eligible for enrollment into study JUVE-X.  
In JUVE-BASIS, patients received open-label once daily baricitinib for approximately 12 weeks from 
baseline. Patients 2 to less than 9 years received 2 mg daily and patients 9 to less than 18 years 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
received 4 mg daily, to attain an equivalent exposure to a 4 mg dose in adults. At week 12, treatment 
response (based on PedACR30 criteria) was reviewed for each patient. Patients who achieved at least a 
PedACR30 response were randomised (1:1 ratio) to receive placebo or to remain on the same 
baricitinib dose in the 32-week double-blind, placebo-controlled phase. Patients who did not achieve 
PedACR30 were given the option of enrolling to JUVE-X. 
The primary efficacy endpoint of  JUVE-BASIS was time to disease flare from the initiation of the 
DBW period to the end of the DBW period.  
Baseline characteristics 
A total of 220 patients enrolled JUVE-BASIS. Of these, 163 (74.4 %) patients were eligible to be 
randomised into the DBW period to either baricitinib (n=82) or placebo (n=81). There were 
144 patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, 16 with extended oligoarticular course 
juvenile idiopathic arthritis, 50 with enthesitis-related juvenile idiopathic arthritis and 10 with juvenile 
psoriatic arthritis. 
In JUVE-BASIS, the mean age was 13 years (standard deviation 3.4) and 69.1 % were female.  Patient 
numbers per age group were as follows:  2 to <6 years: n=6;  6 to <9 years: n=9; 9 to <12 years: n=30; 
and 12 to <18 years: n=175 .   
The average time reported by all patients in the study since juvenile idiopathic arthritis diagnosis was 
4 years. Use of concomitant therapies was similar across treatment groups in the DBW period (most 
common concomitant csDMARDs included MTX, sulfasalazine and leflunomide). A total of 
127 (57.7 %) patients were on MTX at baseline. 
Clinical response 
In JUVE-BASIS, the group of baricitinib treated patients  had a significantly longer time to disease 
flare compared to those receiving placebo (Figure 3). In addition, more patients treated with baricitinib 
achieved a PedACR value of 30/50/70/90/100 throughout the DBW period, as compared to placebo.

*b P-value is from logrank test stratified by juvenile idiopathic arthritis categories (polyarticular and

Time to disease flare and PedACR score results were overall consistent across juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis subtypes and background characteristics (including age, geography, weight, prior use of 
biologic, concomitant use of MTX or corticosteroids), and were consistent with those for the overall 
study population. 
Paediatric atopic dermatitis  
The efficacy and safety of baricitinib in combination with TCS were assessed in a single Phase III 
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 16 week study (BREEZE-AD-PEDS). The study 
included 483 patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis defined by IGA score ≥ 3, an EASI 
score ≥ 16, and a BSA involvement of ≥ 10 %. Eligible patients were 2 to less than 18 years of age and 
had previous inadequate response or were intolerant to topical medications and were candidates for 
systemic therapy. All patients were prescribed concomitant low or medium potency topical 
corticosteroids and patients were permitted to use topical calcineurin inhibitors during the study. 
Patients were randomised to placebo or baricitinib low, medium or high dose tested (resulting in 
equivalent exposure to 1 mg, 2 mg or 4 mg in adult AD patients, respectively) in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. The 
study includes an ongoing long-term extension for up to 4 years. 
Baseline characteristics 
Across all treatment groups, 76 % were Caucasian, 15% were Asian and 3 % were Black, 50 % were 
female and mean age was 12 years with 72 % at least 10 years of age and 28 % less than 10 years of 
age. Patients 6 years and younger comprised 14% of the population (6 years [N=28], 5 years [N=11], 4 
years [N=16], 3 years [N=8], 2 years [N=5]). In this study, 38 % of patients had a baseline IGA of 4 
(severe atopic dermatitis), and 42 % of patients had received prior systemic treatment for atopic 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
dermatitis. The baseline EASI score ranged from 12.2 to 70.8, the baseline weekly averaged Itch 
Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) in patients at least 10 years of age was 5.5 (SD = 2.6). 
Clinical response 
A statistically significant larger proportion of patients randomised to the baricitinib 4 mg equivalent 
dose achieved an IGA 0 or 1 response (primary outcome), EASI75, or an improvement of ≥ 4 points 
on the Itch NRS compared to placebo at week 16 (Table 10). Figure 4 shows the time course of 
achieving IGA 0 or 1. 
Treatment effects in subgroups (weight, age, gender, race, disease severity, and previous treatment, 
including immunosuppressants) were consistent with the results in the overall study population.

A significantly greater proportion of patients randomised to the baricitinib 4 mg equivalent dose 
achieved a ≥ 4-point improvement in the Itch NRS compared to placebo as early as week 4 (adjusted 
for multiplicity). 
The need for concomitant TCS use was reduced as demonstrated by a median reduction in gram 
quantity of TCS use for the baricitinib 4 mg equivalent dose versus placebo over 16 weeks and a 
greater median number of TCS-free days for the baricitinib 4 mg equivalent dose (25 days) versus 
placebo (11 days) over 16 weeks. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
baricitinib in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in chronic idiopathic arthritis, atopic 
dermatitis and alopecia areata (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).  
The efficacy of baricitinib up to 12 mg/day has been evaluated in 71 patients with CANDLE (chronic 
atypical neutrophilic dermatosis with lipodystrophy and elevated temperature, n=10), 
CANDLE-related conditions (CANDLE-RC, n=9), SAVI (Stimulator of interferon gene-Associated 
Vasculopathy with onset during Infancy, n=8), Juvenile DermatoMyositis (JDM, n=5), and 
Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS, n=39). Total patient-years of exposure (PYE) was 251. Due to 
methodological insufficiencies no definite conclusion could be drawn on the efficacy of baricitinib in 
these patients. Although safety patterns showed similarities with the adult indications, frequencies of 
adverse events were generally higher. Three deaths were observed, in the AGS population; it is 
unclear whether these deaths were related to treatment with baricitinib.  
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
Following oral administration of baricitinib, a dose-proportional increase in systemic exposure was 
observed in the therapeutic dose range. The PK of baricitinib is linear with respect to time.  
29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Absorption  
Following oral administration, baricitinib is rapidly absorbed with a median tmax of approximately 
1 hour (range 0.5 - 3.0 h) and an absolute bioavailability of approximately 79 % (CV = 3.94 %). Food 
intake led to a decreased exposure by up to 14 %, a decrease in Cmax by up to 18 % and delayed tmax by 
0.5 hours. Administration with meals was not associated with a clinically relevant effect on exposure.  
Distribution  
Mean volume of distribution following intravenous infusion administration was 76 L, indicating 
distribution of baricitinib into tissues. Baricitinib is approximately 50 % bound to plasma proteins.  
Biotransformation  
Baricitinib metabolism is mediated by CYP3A4, with less than 10 % of the dose identified as 
undergoing biotransformation. No metabolites were quantifiable in plasma. In a clinical pharmacology 
study, baricitinib was excreted predominately as the unchanged active substance in urine (69 %) and 
faeces (15 %) and only 4 minor oxidative metabolites were identified (3 in urine; 1 in faeces) 
constituting approximately 5 % and 1 % of the dose, respectively. In vitro, baricitinib is a substrate for 
CYP3A4, OAT3, Pgp, BCRP and MATE2-K, and may be a clinically relevant inhibitor of the 
transporter OCT1 (see section 4.5). Baricitinib is not an inhibitor of the transporters OAT1, OAT2, 
OAT3, OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, BCRP, MATE1 and MATE2-K at clinically relevant 
concentrations.  
Elimination  
Renal elimination is the principal mechanism for baricitinib’s clearance through glomerular filtration 
and active secretion via OAT3, Pgp, BCRP and MATE2-K. In a clinical pharmacology study, 
approximately 75 % of the administered dose was eliminated in the urine, while about 20 % of the 
dose was eliminated in the faeces.  
Mean apparent clearance (CL/F) and half-life in patients with rheumatoid arthritis was 9.42 L/hr 
(CV = 34.3 %) and 12.5 hrs (CV = 27.4 %), respectively. Cmax and AUC at steady state are 1.4- and 
2.0-fold higher, respectively, in subjects with rheumatoid arthritis compared to healthy subjects.  
Mean apparent clearance (CL/F) and half-life in patients with atopic dermatitis was 11.2 L/hr 
(CV = 33.0 %) and 12.9 hrs (CV = 36.0 %), respectively. Cmax and AUC at steady state in patients 
with atopic dermatitis are 0.8-fold those seen in rheumatoid arthritis.  
Mean apparent clearance (CL/F) and half-life in patients with alopecia areata was 11.0 L/hr 
(CV = 36.0 %) and 15.8 hrs (CV = 35.0 %), respectively. Cmax and AUC at steady state in patients 
with alopecia areata are 0.9-fold those seen in rheumatoid arthritis.  
Renal impairment  
Renal function was found to significantly affect baricitinib exposure. The mean ratios of AUC in 
patients with mild and moderate renal impairment to patients with normal renal function are 1.41 
(90 % CI: 1.15-1.74) and 2.22 (90 % CI: 1.81-2.73), respectively. The mean ratios of Cmax in patients 
with mild and moderate renal impairment to patients with normal renal function are 1.16 
(90 %CI: 0.92-1.45) and 1.46 (90 %CI: 1.17-1.83), respectively. See section 4.2 for dose 
recommendations.  
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hepatic impairment  
There was no clinically relevant effect on the PK of baricitinib in patients with mild or moderate 
hepatic impairment. The use of baricitinib has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment.  
Elderly  
Age ≥ 65 years or ≥ 75 years has no effect on baricitinib exposure (Cmax and AUC).  
Paediatric population  
Pharmacokinetics in paediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis  
The half-life in paediatric patients from 2 to less than18 years was 8 to 9 hours.  
Exposure in paediatric patients weighing <30 kg and ≥ 30 kg: In patients < 30 kg with a mean age and 
range of 8.1 (2.0-16.0) years, the mean and CV% for AUC and Cmax was 381 h*ng/mL (76%) and 
62.1 ng/mL (39%), respectively.  In patients ≥ 30 kg with mean age and range of 14.1 (9.0 – 17.0), the 
mean and CV% for AUC and Cmax was 438 h*ng/mL (68%) and 60.7 ng/mL (30%), respectively. 
Exposure in paediatric patients weighing 10 to <20 kg and 20 to <30 kg: In patients 10 to < 20 kg with 
a mean age and range of 5.1 (2.0-8.0) years, the mean and CV% for AUC and Cmax was 458 
h*ng/mL (81%) and 77.6 ng/mL (38%), respectively .  In patients 20 to < 30 kg with mean age and 
range of 10.3 (6.0 – 16.0), the mean and CV% for AUC and Cmax was 327 h*ng/mL (66%) and 51.2 
ng/mL (22%), respectively. 
Pharmacokinetics in paediatric patients with atopic dermatitis  
The mean half-life in paediatric patients from 2 to less than 18 years was 13 to 18 hours.  
Exposure in paediatric patients weighing < 30 kg and ≥ 30 kg: In patients < 30 kg with a mean age and 
range of 6.4 (2.0-11.1) years, the mean and CV% for AUC and Cmax was 404 h*ng/mL (78%) and 
60.4 ng/mL (28%), respectively. In patients ≥ 30 kg with mean age and range of 13.5 (6.2 – 17.9), the 
mean and CV% for AUC and Cmax was 529 h*ng/mL (102%) and 57.0 ng/mL (42%), respectively.  
Exposure in paediatric patients weighing 10 to < 20 kg and 20 to <30 kg: In patients 10 to < 20 kg 
with a mean age and range of 4.8 (2.0-6.9) years, the mean and CV% for AUC and Cmax was 467 
h*ng/mL (80%) and 73.4 ng/mL (21%), respectively . In patients 20 to < 30 kg with mean age and 
range of 7.5 (4.8 – 11.1), the mean and CV% for AUC and Cmax was 363 h*ng/mL (72%) and 52.0 
ng/mL (21%), respectively  
Other intrinsic factors  
Body weight, age, sex, race, and ethnicity did not have a clinically relevant effect on the PK of 
baricitinib in adult patients. The mean effects of intrinsic factors on PK parameters (AUC and Cmax) 
were generally within the inter-subject PK variability of baricitinib. Therefore, no dose adjustment is 
needed based on these patient factors.  
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential. 
Decreases in lymphocytes, eosinophils and basophils as well as lymphoid depletion in organs/tissues 
of the immune system were observed in mice, rats and dogs. Opportunistic infections related to 
demodicosis (mange) were observed in dogs at exposures approximately 7 times the human exposure. 
Decreases in red blood cell parameters were observed in mice, rats and dogs at exposures 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
approximately 6 to 36 times the human exposure. Degeneration of the sternal growth plate was 
observed in some dogs, at low incidence and also in control animals, but with a dose-effect 
relationship regarding severity. At present it is not known whether this is clinically relevant. 
In rat and rabbit reproductive toxicology studies, baricitinib was shown to reduce foetal growth/weight 
and produce skeletal malformations (at exposures of approximately 10 and 39 times the human 
exposure, respectively). No adverse foetal effects were observed at exposures 2 times the human 
exposure based on AUC. 
In a combined male/female rat fertility study, baricitinib decreased overall mating performance 
(decreased fertility and conception indices). In female rats there were decreased numbers of corpora 
lutea and implantation sites, increased pre-implantation loss, and/or adverse effects on intrauterine 
survival of the embryos. Since there were no effects on spermatogenesis (as assessed by 
histopathology) or semen/sperm endpoints in male rats, the decreased overall mating performance was 
likely the result of these female effects. 
Baricitinib was detected in the milk of lactating rats. In a pre- and postnatal development study, 
decreased pup weights and decreased postnatal survival were observed at exposures 4 and 21 times, 
respectively, the human exposure.

Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
C.  OTHER CONDITIONS AND REQUIREMENTS OF THE MARKETING 
AUTHORISATION  
•  Periodic safety update reports (PSURs) 
The requirements for submission of PSURs for this medicinal product are set out in the list of Union 
reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any 
subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
D.  CONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS WITH REGARD TO THE SAFE AND 
EFFECTIVE USE OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT  
•  Risk management plan (RMP) 
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities 
and interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation 
and any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
•  Additional risk minimisation measures 
Prior to launch of baricitinib in each Member State, the MAH must agree about the content and format 
of the educational materials, including communication media, distribution modalities, and any other 
aspects of the programme, with the National Competent Authority.  
The main objectives of the programme are to make the prescribers aware of the risks associated with 
the product’s use, and to highlight specific risk minimisation measures to be performed before and 
during the treatment with baricitinib.  
36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The MAH shall ensure that, in each Member State where baricitinib is marketed, all healthcare 
professionals who are expected to prescribe baricitinib are provided with the physician educational 
material, which should contain:  
•  The Summary of Product Characteristics 
•  The Package Leaflet including the Patient Alert Card 
•  The guide for healthcare professionals to support counselling of the patient 
•  Additional Patient Alert Cards 
The guide for healthcare professionals shall contain the following key elements: 
• 
Indication and posology statements provided to reinforce in whom baricitinib should be used 
•  That baricitinib increases the potential risk of infections. Patients should be instructed to seek 
immediate medical attention, if signs or symptoms suggesting infection appear. As there is a 
higher incidence of infections in the elderly and in the diabetic populations in general, caution 
should be used when treating the elderly and patients with diabetes. Baricitinib should only be 
used in patients 65 years of age and older if no suitable treatment alternatives are available.  
•  That baricitinib use should be stopped in case of herpes zoster or any other infection that 
doesn’t respond to standard treatment until the event resolves. Patients should not be 
immunised using live attenuated vaccines shortly before or during treatment with baricitinib.  
•  Prior to initiating treatment it is recommended that all patients, particularly paediatric patients, 
be brought up to date with all immunisations in agreement with local current immunisation 
guidelines 
•  Prescribers should screen the patients for viral hepatitis before commencing baricitinib 
treatment. Active tuberculosis should also be ruled out.  
•  That baricitinib use is associated with hyperlipidaemia; prescribers should monitor the 
patient’s lipid parameters and manage the hyperlipidaemia, if detected.  
•  Baricitinib increases the risk of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.. Baricitinib should 
be used with caution in patients with known risk factors for DVT/PE other than cardiovascular or 
malignancy risk factors. Patients should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if signs 
or symptoms of DVT/PE appear. 
•  That there is a potentially increased risk of MACE in patients with certain risk factors using JAK 
inhibitor treatment, including baricitinib. In patients 65 years of age and older , patients who are 
current or past long term smokers, and patients with other cardiovascular risk factors, baricitinib 
should only be used if no suitable treatment alternatives are available. 
•  That Lymphoma and other malignancies have been reported in patients receiving JAK inhibitors, 
including baricitinib. In patients over 65 years of age, patients who are current or past long term 
smokers, or with other malignancy risk factors (e.g. current malignancy or history of malignancy) 
baricitinib should only be used if no suitable treatment alternatives are available.  
•  That baricitinib is contraindicated in pregnancy as pre-clinical data showed reduced foetal 
growth and malformations. Physicians should advise women of child bearing potential to use 
contraception during treatment and for a week after its ending. If a planned pregnancy is 
considered, baricitinib treatment should be stopped. 
•  The purpose and use of the Patient Alert Card. 
The patient alert card shall contain the following key messages:  
•  That treatment with baricitinib may increase the risk of infections, and viral reactivation 
which can become serious if not treated.  
•  Signs or symptoms of infections including general symptoms, and specifically tuberculosis 
and herpes zoster signs and symptoms; and a warning for the patients to seek immediate 
medical attention if signs or symptoms suggesting infection appear. 
•  Patients should seek immediate medical attention if signs and symptoms of myocardial 
infarction or stroke occur. 
•  That baricitinib should not be taken while pregnant and that women should inform their doctor 
should they become (or wish to become) pregnant. 
•  That baricitinib may cause a blood clot in the leg that may travel to the lungs; a description of 
signs and symptoms is provided, along with a warning for the patients to seek immediate medical 
attention if signs or symptoms suggesting a blood clot appear. 
37 
 
 
•  That baricitinib may cause non-melanoma skin cancer and that the patients should talk to their 
doctor if new skin lesions appear during or after therapy or if existing lesions change 
appearance, tell your doctor. 
•  Contact details of the prescriber. 
•  That the Patient Alert Card should be carried by the patient at any time and to share it with 
other healthcare professionals involved in their treatment.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Olumiant is and what it is used for 
Olumiant contains the active substance baricitinib. It belongs to a group of medicines called Janus 
kinase inhibitors, which help to reduce inflammation.  
Rheumatoid arthritis 
Olumiant is used to treat adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, an inflammatory disease 
of the joints, if previous therapy did not work well enough or was not tolerated. Olumiant can be used 
alone or together with some other medicines, such as methotrexate. 
Olumiant works by reducing the activity of an enzyme in the body called ‘Janus kinase’, which is 
involved in inflammation. By reducing the activity of this enzyme, Olumiant helps to reduce pain, 
stiffness and swelling in your joints, tiredness, and helps to slow damage to the bone and cartilage in 
the joints. These effects can help you to do normal daily activities and so improve the health-related 
quality of life for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. 
Atopic dermatitis 
Olumiant is used to treat children from the age of 2 years, adolescents and adults with moderate to 
severe atopic dermatitis, also known as atopic eczema. Olumiant may be used with eczema medicines 
that you apply to the skin or it may be used on its own. 
Olumiant works by reducing the activity of an enzyme in the body called ‘Janus kinase’, which is 
involved in inflammation. By reducing the activity of this enzyme, Olumiant helps to improve the 
condition of your skin and reduce itching. In addition, Olumiant helps improve your sleep disturbance 
(due to itch) and overall quality of life. Olumiant has also been shown to improve symptoms of skin 
pain, anxiety, and depression associated with atopic dermatitis. 
54 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Alopecia areata 
Olumiant is used to treat adults with severe alopecia areata, an autoimmune disease characterized by 
inflammatory, nonscarring hair loss on the scalp, face and sometimes on other areas of the body that 
can be recurrent and progressive. 
Olumiant works by reducing the activity of an enzyme in the body called ‘Janus kinase’, which is 
involved in inflammation. By reducing the activity of this enzyme, Olumiant helps hair to regrow on 
scalp, face and other areas of the body impacted by the disease.  
Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, enthesitis-related arthritis and juvenile psoriatic 
arthritis 
Olumiant is used for the treatment of active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, an inflammatory 
disease of the joints, in children 2 years of age and older.  
Olumiant is also used for the treatment of active enthesitis-related arthritis, an inflammatory disease of 
the joints and the places where tendons join the bone, in children 2 years of age and older. 
Olumiant is also used for the treatment of active juvenile psoriatic arthritis, a condition that is an 
inflammatory disease of the joints often accompanied by psoriasis, in children 2 years of age and 
older. 
Olumiant can be used alone or together with methotrexate.

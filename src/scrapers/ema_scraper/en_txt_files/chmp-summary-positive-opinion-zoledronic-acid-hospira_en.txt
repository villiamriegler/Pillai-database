and Zoledronic Acid Hospira 5 mg/ 100 ml in the: 
 
 
Treatment of osteoporosis  
 
 
in post-menopausal women  
in men  
at increased risk of fracture, including those with a recent low-trauma hip fracture.  
Treatment of osteoporosis associated with long-term systemic glucocorticoid therapy  


The applicant for this medicinal product is Hospira UK Ltd. They may request a re-examination of any 
CHMP opinion, provided they notify the European Medicines Agency in writing of their intention within 
15 days of receipt of the opinion. 
The active substance of Zoledronic Acid Hospira is zoledronic acid, a bisphosphonate (M05BA08). 
Zoledronic acid stops the action of the osteoclasts, the cells in the body that are involved in breaking 
down the bone tissue. This leads to less bone loss. The reduction of bone loss helps to make bones less 
likely to break, which is useful in preventing fractures in cancer patients with bone metastases. 
1 Summaries of positive opinion are published without prejudice to the commission decision, which will normally be issued 
67 days from adoption of the opinion.

Patients with tumours can have high levels of calcium in their blood, released from the bones. By 
preventing the breakdown of bones, zoledronic acid also helps to reduce the amount of calcium 
released into the blood. 
Zoledronic Acid Hospira is a generic of Zometa and Aclasta, which have been authorised in the EU 
since 20/03/2001 (Zometa) and 15 April 2005 (Aclasta). Studies have demonstrated the satisfactory 
quality of Zoledronic Acid Hospira. This product is administered intravenously and is 100% 
bioavailable; therefore, a bioequivalence study versus the reference product Zometa or Aclasta was 
not required. A question and answer document on generic medicines can be found here.  
A pharmacovigilance plan for Zoledronic Acid Hospira will be implemented as part of the marketing 
authorisation.  
The approved indication is:

professionals experienced in the administration of intravenous biphosphonates.  
It is proposed that for the treatment of Paget’s disease, Zoledronic acid Hospira 5 mg/ 100 ml is 
prescribed only by physicians with experience in the treatment of Paget’s disease of the bone.   
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the European public assessment report (EPAR), and 
will be available in all official European Union languages after the marketing authorisation has been 
granted by the European Commission.

favourable benefit to risk balance for Zoledronic Acid Hospira and therefore recommends the granting

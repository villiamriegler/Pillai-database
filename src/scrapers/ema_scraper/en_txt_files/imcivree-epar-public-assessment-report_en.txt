1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Rhythm Pharmaceuticals Limited submitted  on 26 June 2020 an application for 
marketing authorisation  to the European Medicines Agency (EMA)  for Imcivree, through the centralised 
procedure falling within  the Article 3(1) and point 4  of Annex of Regulation (EC) No  726/2004.  The 
eligibility to  the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP  on 31  May 2018. 
Imcivree was designated as an orphan medicinal product: 
- EU/3/6/1703  on 14 July 2016 in the  following condition: Treatment of pro-opiomelanocortin 
deficiency 
- EU/3/18/2101  on 19 November 2018 in  the following condition: Treatment of leptin receptor 
deficiency 
Imcivree was granted eligibility to  PRIME on 28  June 2018 in the  following indication:  Treatment of 
obesity and the  control of hunger associated with  deficiency disorders of the MC4R receptor pathway. 
Eligibility  to PRIME was granted at  the time in view of the  following: 
• 
• 
There is an unmet medical need for the treatment of morbid obesity in the targeted genetic 
conditions given the lack of effective treatment options; morbid obesity in these conditions is 
associated with  increased long-term morbidity and mortality, e.g. development of type 2 diabetes, 
dyslipidaemia, cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, impaired mobility,  social/psychological 
impact adding to other primary symptoms of the genetic syndromes. 
The presented preliminary evidence from 11  patients with  POMC deficiency, LEPR deficiency, 
Bardet-Biedl syndrome and Alstroem syndrome provides clinical proof of concept in genetic obesity 
syndromes affecting signalling upstream MC4Rs.   
•  Weight reduction and hunger score reduction of highly clinically relevant effect size have been 
demonstrated, sustained for treatment durations of up to 118  weeks with  evidence of dose-
response upon dose reduction or treatment cessation/re-initiation; Insulin levels, OGTT profiles, 
lipid profiles were improved suggesting a potential to lower risk for long-term cardiovascular 
morbidity and mortality. 
The applicant initially applied for the  following indication: 
Imcivree is indicated for the treatment of obesity and the control of hunger associated with  biallelic 
pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), including  PCSK1, deficiency obesity or leptin  receptor (LEPR) deficiency 
obesity in adults and children 6  years of age and above. 
The final applied indication  was as follows: 
Imcivree is indicated for the treatment of obesity and the control of hunger associated with  genetically 
confirmed loss-of-function biallelic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), including  PCSK1, deficiency or 
biallelic leptin receptor (LEPR) deficiency in  adults and children 6 years of age and above. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC  - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/319064/2021 
Page 8/143 
 
 
 
substituting/supporting  certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006,  the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0164/2018  on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). 
At the time of submission of the application, the agreed PIP (P/0164/2018)  was not  yet completed as 
some measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Following  the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan 
Medicinal Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Imcivree as an orphan medicinal product in the 
approved indication. More information on the COMP’s review can be found in the  Orphan maintenance 
assessment report published under the ‘Assessment history’ tab on the Agency’s 
website: https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/imcivree 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000  and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000,  the applicant  did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indication. 
Applicant’s request(s) for consideration 
New active substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance setmelanotide contained in the above medicinal product 
to be considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it  is not a constituent  of a 
medicinal product previously authorised within  the European Union. 
PRIME support 
Upon granting of eligibility to  PRIME, Bart Van der Schueren was appointed by the CHMP as rapporteur 
and later replaced by Karin Janssen van Doorn. 
A kick-off meeting was held on 12 November 2018.  The objective of the meeting was to discuss the 
development programme and regulatory strategy for the product. The applicant was recommended to 
address the following key issues through relevant regulatory procedures:  
Accuracy of drug delivery to adult and paediatric patient populations, comparability of once weekly 
formulations in vials versus pre-filled syringes produced at different manufacturing sites, use of patient 
registries for long-term follow-up of patients, and pathway driven development

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The indication initially applied for is: “Treatment of obesity and the control of hunger associated with 
biallelic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), including PCSK1, deficiency obesity or leptin receptor (LEPR) 
deficiency obesity in adults and children 6  years of age and above.” 
The final applied indication  was as follows: 
“Imcivree is indicated for the treatment  of obesity and the control of hunger associated with  genetically 
confirmed loss-of-function biallelic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), including  PCSK1, deficiency or 
biallelic leptin receptor (LEPR) deficiency in  adults and children 6 years of age and above.” 
Genetic obesity disorders caused by defects in  melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R)  pathway, including 
POMC and LEPR deficiency obesity, are unified by their shared pathogenesis arising from specific gene 
defects along a common hypothalamic neuroendocrine pathway. 
Throughout the report, the terminology “POMC, LEPR patients or populations” are used to define the 
population with  deficiencies affecting these genes. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
There are no available data on incidence of obesity due to POMC deficiency or LEPR deficiency. POMC 
and LEPR deficiencies can be confirmed only following genetic testing.  Nonetheless, on the basis of the 
very small number of cases recorded in worldwide literature, it is estimated that fewer than 50 affected 
individuals with  POMC deficiency (Challis &  Millington,  2013),  fewer than 90  individuals with LEPR 
deficiency (Kleinendorst et al., 2020), and fewer than 50 PCKS1 deficiency cases have been reported 
thus far (Stijnen et al., 2016;  Argente et al., 2019). 
Individuals with  POMC deficiency obesity or LEPR deficiency obesity exhibit an onset very early in life, 
often beginning in infancy. 
As patients grow and develop, paediatric weight  curves demonstrate progressive and severe weight 
gain, tracking greater than 3 standard deviations (SD) above normal weights  for age and leading 
ultimately to adult  body mass index (BMI) values >40  kg/m2. Patients  with POMC deficiency obesity 
often weigh over 100 kg by age 6 to 8  years. (Challis & Millington,  2013). 
In a systematic literature search (Kleinendorst et al., 2020), the  authors calculated 998  predicted 
patients with  LEPR deficiency in Europe, corresponding to a prevalence of 1.34 per 1 million people. 
Consanguinity was reported in 74%  LEPR cases of this  analysis (Kleinendorst et  al., 2020). 
According to a literature review commissioned by the applicant (Argente et al., 2019) the  population 
key findings can be summarised as follows: 
Among the population of patients with  POMC deficiency obesity, 39%  were from Turkey, North Africa, 
Middle East,  or Southwest Asia, and 39% were from the European Union (EU) and North  America; no 
country of origin was documented for the  remaining 23%  of patients.  With regards to  ethnicity, 48% 
were Turkish, Arabic, or Southwest Asian; 29% were Caucasian, and 6% were Hispanic. Twenty-six 
percent of patients  were known to be from consanguineous families. A total of 74% of patients had 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/319064/2021 
Page 12/143 
 
 
 
been diagnosed by age 10 years. Sixty-eight percent of patients  were noted to have hyperphagia, 
described as severe in some cases. Common laboratory findings included low adrenocorticotropic 
hormone (ACTH), hypocortisolism, hypoglycaemia, and hypothyroidism. Cognitive impairment was 
uncommon (3 patients). No  specific findings were noted that were specific to the  EU region.  
Among the population of patients with  LEPR deficiency obesity, 51%  were from Turkey, North Africa, 
Middle East,  or Southwest Asia. With  regard to ethnicity, 64%  were Turkish, Arabic, or Southwest 
Asian. Seventy percent of patients were known or suspected to be from consanguineous families. 
Ninety-seven percent of patients had documentation of early-onset obesity, with 100%  having 
hyperphagia, in some cases severe or marked. Among patients who were old enough for assessment, 
~40%  had delayed puberty. Common laboratory abnormalities included elevated leptin and 
hyperinsulinemia. Cognitive delay was not common (4 patients).  No specific findings were noted that 
were specific to the EU region.  
The published literature for LEPR deficiency includes a few small series of patients from key academic 
medicine centers. The existence of these series suggested that  LEPR deficiency may be slightly more 
frequent than POMC deficiency. The prevalence of LEPR deficiency in the United  States based on 
genetic epidemiology is ~3500 patients,  with  an assumed similar number of patients in Europe. But it 
is worth noting  that these patients  are generally “hidden” in the extremely large number of early-
onset, severe obesity patients in the  global population.  Until  diagnostic genotyping becomes an 
established procedure in the evaluation of early-onset obesity, the actual number of diagnosed LEPR 
deficiency patients is likely to  remain very small.  
2.1.3.  Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
The physiology of hypothalamic control of appetite is the basis of disorders arising from genetic defects 
upstream in the MC4R pathway. The hypothalamus serves as the key integrative region of the brain for 
energy metabolism, hunger and satiety. It includes both  stimulatory and inhibitory  pathways / regions 
that  coordinate and regulate appetite,  caloric intake and energy expenditure. 
In the hypothalamus, the melanocortin system is set up to defend against starvation by promoting 
hunger and food seeking behaviour; MC4R  acts as a natural brake. Activation of MC4R suppresses food 
intake (reduces appetite); inhibition  of MC4R (removal of the brake) causes increased food intake. The 
activation of MC4R is controlled by 2 distinct  populations of neurons, which lie immediately upstream 
and synapse with  neurons that  express MC4R on their  surface. See Figure 1.

Figure 1 : Schematic of the  Hypothalamic MC4R  Pathway 
LepR = leptin receptor 
β-MSH  = β-melanocyte stimulating  hormone 
ISR = insulin  receptor 
NPY = Neuropeptide Y 
GHR = ghrelin receptor 
AGRP = agouti-related peptide 
POMC = pro-opiomelanocortin 
MC4R = melanocortin receptor type 4 
PC1 = pro-hormone convertase 1 (PCSK1) 
SIM-1 = Single minded homolog 1

BDNF = brain derived neurotrophic factor 
One population of upstream neurons releases POMC-derived melanocortin peptides from their nerve 
terminals, which act as endogenous agonists at MC4R; the  primary function of this population  is to 
suppress appetite. The second population  of neurons releases a different neuropeptide, AGRP (agouti-
related peptide),  which is a competitive antagonist  at MC4R; the primary function  of this population is 
to stimulate  food intake. These are not  on/off signals – the  relative amount of pro-opiomelanocortin 
(POMC) or AGRP released in a particular setting determines the degree of activation of MC4R  or 
melanocortin tone, which in turn  modulates food intake. These 2 neuronal populations express the 
leptin receptor (LEPR)  and as such respond to the  peripheral hormone leptin, which  is the major signal 
of nutritional  state.  
In healthy subjects, in  the fasted state,  low levels of leptin stimulate AGRP neurons while at the same 
time inhibiting  POMC neurons. The cumulative effect is more antagonist than  agonist, reduced MC4R 
signal (the brake), increased food intake –  the physiological response to seek more food to restore 
energy homeostasis. In the fed state, increased leptin levels stimulate  POMC neurons, while  at the 
same time inhibiting  AGRP neurons. The cumulative effect is more agonist than  antagonist, increased 
MC4R signal, reduced food intake.

Consistent with  its sensory role, POMC neurons express both LEPR and insulin receptors (ISR). 
Importantly, however, in contrast to LEPR, ISR signalling within  the MC4R- pathway does not influence 
appetite or body weight.   
The melanocortins are a family of peptide hormones (including  ACTH, α-MSH,  β-MSH, and γ-MSH)  that 
are all derived from the common precursor, POMC. The melanocortins regulate energy homeostasis 
and body weight.  The MC4R has been identified as the dominant melanocortin receptor involved in 
body weight,  hunger, and energy homeostasis regulation. Under normal conditions,  the natural ligands 
for the MC4R (different forms of melanocyte stimulating  hormone; MSH)  in the hypothalamus derive 
from POMC neurons, are cleaved by the specific proprotein convertase subtilisin / kexin type 1 (PCSK1) 
cleavage enzyme, and activate the MC4R  resulting in decreased hunger, weight,  and resting energy 
expenditure. In turn,  POMC neurons can be activated by the anorexigenic, fat-derived hormone, leptin 
and by other brain signals. In addition, a second inhibitory pathway also converges on the MC4R  in 
which the  peripheral hormone ghrelin stimulates hypothalamic Neuropeptide Y and Agouti- Related 
Peptide producing neurons, which each increase appetite and reduce metabolic rate. These powerful 
orexigenic (appetite-stimulating)  signals can be countered by melanocortin agonists through activation 
of the MC4R.  
The vital importance of this pathway in hunger and weight  reduction is supported by strong clinical 
genetic validation. Genetic defects for all the steps in the  stimulatory MC4R pathway (both in humans 
and in rodents) have resulted in the expected phenotype: early-onset extreme obesity and 
hyperphagia. POMC deficiency obesity is caused by bi-allelic (either homozygous or compound 
heterozygous) loss of the  POMC gene function and/or bi-allelic loss of PCSK1 gene function impairing 
cleavage of the POMC precursor peptide.  
Complete POMC deficiency (biallelic mutations)  results in loss of endogenous MC4R  agonist. As the 
endogenous antagonist  (Agouti-related peptide or AGRP) is not affected, this results in markedly 
reduced melanocortin tone, which manifests as hyperphagia, driving severe obesity.  
LEPR deficiency obesity is caused by bi-allelic (either homozygous or compound heterozygous) loss of 
the LEPR.In LEPR deficiency, patients lose the ability to regulate both POMC and AGRP neurons, likely 
resulting in basal low levels of melanocortin tone. In addition, LEPR is expressed on other (non- 
melanocortin) neuronal populations both  within  the hypothalamus and in other areas involved in food 
reward such as the striatum and ventral tegmental area. As such the  hyperphagia and obesity in LEPR 
deficient patients is usually more severe than seen in POMC deficiency (many patients do not survive) 
and is mediated by both melanocortin (setmelanotide-responsive) and melanocortin-independent 
(setmelanotide-unresponsive) pathways.  
POMC deficiency obesity  
Neuropeptides synthesized and processed from the POMC gene are absent or deficient in patients  with 
POMC deficiency obesity due to defects in 2 genes, both of which are upstream of MC4R. These defects 
are loss of function mutations  in the POMC gene itself;  and loss of function mutations  in the PCSK1 
gene, which encodes proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1. The PCSK1 protein processes the 
POMC peptide into derivative MSH  neuropeptides that  bind to MC4R in  target hypothalamic neurons.  
These 2 specific monogenic disorders result in clinical POMC deficiency due to missing derivative (MSH) 
neuropeptide synthesis and/or processing, with  subsequent absence or reduction in signalling through 
the hypothalamic MC4R pathway mediating central nervous system (CNS) control of appetite and 
weight  regulation. POMC deficiency is the  most proximal genetic defect in the  MC4R pathway obesity 
disorders. Accordingly, affected patients  demonstrate extreme early- onset obesity and hyperphagia as 
core clinical features.

Congenital LEPR deficiency is caused by bi-allelic mutations in the LEPR gene. As with  POMC deficiency, 
it also results in absent or insufficient  signalling through the MC4R  pathway to activate MC4R.  
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
Individuals with  POMC and LEPR deficiencies exhibit an unrelenting hunger and food-seeking 
behaviours (hyperphagia) very early in life, often beginning in infancy, and severe obesity follows 
shortly thereafter. As patients grow and develop, paediatric weight  curves demonstrate progressive 
and severe weight gain, tracking >3  SD above normal weight-for-age and leading ultimately to adult 
BMI values >40 kg/m2. (Challis & Millington,  2013).   
When considering the  POMC and LEPR deficiency obesity populations, the patients  are not in a 
continuum  that increases from overweight to obese through  “severe” or “extreme” obesity (i.e., the 
worst obesity). Instead, consistent  morbid obesity (e.g., extreme obesity) is characteristic of these 
genetically defined diseases and is the hallmark of every patient who has one of these diseases.  
Patients with  such POMC or LEPR gene mutations exhibit an onset very early in life, often beginning in 
infancy, with rapid weight  gain that  is associated with  a voracious, overactive appetite and pronounced 
hyperphagic feeding behaviours. Remarkable weight increases over 3 SD from the normal weight 
growth curves are typical in  these patients.  Unlike in patients with  general obesity, these patients 
continue to gain weight  across their lifetime, with  an average weight gain of 7-10  kg/year, for every 
year of life (primarily analysed in the paediatric and adolescent populations that have these diseases). 
Childhood weight gain is severe and rapidly progressive, ultimately leading to adult  BMI values 
typically >40 kg/m2. The effect of extreme obesity in childhood and adolescence is multi-faceted, 
affecting individuals from childhood through adolescence and adulthood. Extreme obesity shows 
substantial tracking into  adulthood and entails elevated mortality and high  rates of co-morbid disorders 
(Freedman et al., 2001). Similarly, children and especially adolescents with  extreme obesity 
experience increased mortality and morbidity, including cardiovascular (CV), metabolic, respiratory and 
orthopaedic complications (Norris et al., 2011;  Schwimmer et al., 2003;  Amin and Daniels, 2002; 
Karlson et al., 2003)  and global impairments in daily functioning  (Zeller et al., 2006).  
Although not  directly life-threatening,  intractable hunger is a second hallmark of these diseases, 
dominatingly affecting the quality of daily life. Parents relate that  children do not  sleep well (hunger at 
night  leading to  night eating);  cannot socialise well with  other children (cannot control their urge to eat 
everything available no matter the social setting); and often suffer in school (distracted by the mental 
impact of intractable hunger that persists at all times).  
Prominent features of the POMC and LEPR deficiency include:  
• 
• 
POMC deficiency obesity: ACTH deficiency and secondary cortisol deficiency. Clinical features of 
affected patients  may include red hair and pale skin (Argente et al 2019)  
LEPR  deficiency obesity:  Hypothyroidism  and/or growth  hormone deficiency,  delayed puberty, 
alterations  in  immune  function,  and  hyperinsulinemia  (Argente  et  al  2019;  Kleinendorst  et  al 
2020)   
In patients with  POMC deficiency red hair and skin paleness can develop due to the  lack of melanocyte 
stimulating  hormone effect on MC1R within  the skin, but this  phenotypic feature is variable, in part 
depending on ethnic background. The lack of ACTH production by the  pituitary gland and consequential 
activation of melanocortin 2 receptors (MC2R)  in the adrenal glands may result in  secondary adrenal 
deficiency. Patients are often diagnosed soon after birth due to adrenal insufficiency. If the diagnosis is 
missed in  early infancy, patients can die from adrenal glucocorticoid insufficiency (many POMC defect 
patients have had siblings with  unexplained early deaths). However, if patients are identified and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/319064/2021 
Page 16/143 
 
 
 
begun on life-sustaining glucocorticoid replacement or if patients  have residual expression of ACTH 
from the  pituitary, voracious infant feeding and weight gain is noted, and obesity develops rapidly 
during early infancy.  
Other endocrine abnormalities observed include central hypothyroidism due to thyroid stimulating 
hormone deficiency, adult  onset growth hormone deficiency, and adolescent-onset hypogonadotropic 
hypogonadism due to lack of luteinising  hormone or follicle stimulating  hormone.  
LEPR deficiency patients may show additional phenotypic features specific to this  genetic disorder 
besides the core clinical features of early onset severe obesity and hyperphagia. Frequent respiratory 
infections resulting from obesity and reduced immune function  have been reported in  children with 
LEPR deficiency, sometimes resulting  in childhood mortality. Insulin resistance and type 2  diabetes 
mellitus are also often reported as complications of extreme obesity in those patients who survive 
childhood. Finally, early mortality associated with  acute upper respiratory infections was reported in 2 
of 10 LEPR deficiency patients, suggesting  a reduced lifespan because of this congenital genetic 
disorder. 
Next to the  direct negative effects experienced due to  the morbid obesity and insatiable hunger 
experienced by these patients, they also must contend with  several serious and potentially life-
threating co-morbidities in the respiratory, CV, hepatic/metabolic, and orthopaedic areas. Frequent 
comorbidities include heart disease, hypertension, lipid abnormalities and type 2 diabetes mellitus, 
obstructive sleep apnoea, leg, hip, and knee fractures/malformation/arthritis, and delays in growth and 
pubertal development. Adrenal insufficiencies, other severe hormonal abnormalities, and risk of 
infections can add to  the seriousness and potentially  life-threatening nature of POMC and LEPR 
deficiency obesities. Given the high risk of cardiac, renal, and/or ophthalmic complications for children 
and young adults, which may lead to premature death,  most of these patients are often heavily 
medicated to  treat these co-morbidities. 
2.1.5.  Management 
There are currently no approved therapies nor products in development specifically for the  obesity and 
hyperphagia associated with  POMC or LEPR deficiencies. Furthermore, there is limited evidence of any 
efficacious treatment for children or adolescents with  these genetic disorders. Although bariatric 
surgery has been attempted in  a significant  number of these patients, it  is uniformly unsuccessful in 
the control of hunger and obesity. Bariatric surgery cannot address the  underlying issue of the lack of 
a satiety signal in  these patients.  As a result, potential  surgical approaches, such as gastric or 
intestinal  bypass operations, are considered contraindicated because such patients maintain  an 
extreme appetite and overeat even after such surgical restrictions, often leading to  anatomical 
complications as a result. 
In addition, there is no evidence that drugs approved for general obesity (including Orlistat,  Saxenda, 
and Mysimba) can reduce weight in MC4R pathway disorder patients.  This lack of efficacy is not 
surprising because these general obesity medicines do not  address the underlying MC4R  pathway 
signalling defects that lead to obesity and hyperphagia. Tremendous efforts in lifestyle modification, 
including exercise and diet, have also proven unsuccessful in most cases. In the cases of both  POMC 
and LEPR deficiency obesity, severe hunger and early-onset obesity are a direct result of the  genetic 
defect and are unresponsive to behavioural modification, surgery, drug intervention, or environmental 
changes. It  is these characteristics that distinguish  these patients from those with  general severe 
obesity, and results in an intractable form of obesity with  serious consequences starting in early 
childhood, with  manifestations of the  disease often apparent in the first  year of life.

There are currently no clinical guidelines in Europe for the treatment or management of POMC or LEPR 
deficiencies.  
Commonly, patients  with POMC deficiency require life-long glucocorticosteroid treatment using 
replacement doses. Mineralocorticoid replacement is not required. Hypothyroidism should be monitored 
and treated if present. Early onset obesity can be very difficult  to treat beyond standard dietary and 
lifestyle measures, but the hyperphagic component is especially challenging (Çetinkaya et al., 2008). 
About the product 
Setmelanotide is an 8-amino acid cyclic peptide analogue of naturally occurring alpha-melanocyte 
stimulating  hormone (α-MSH)  that  functions as a potent melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) agonist. 
Imcivree (Setmelanotide) is a selective MC4 receptor agonist. MC4  receptors in the brain are involved 
in regulation of hunger, satiety, and energy expenditure. In genetic forms of obesity associated with 
insufficient activation of the MC4  receptor, setmelanotide is believed to  re-establish MC4 receptor 
pathway activity to reduce hunger and promote weight  loss through  decreased caloric intake and 
increased energy expenditure.  
The product is presented as 10  mg/ml solution for subcutaneous injection and is intended to  be 
administered once daily. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP agreed to the  applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was 
considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on the fact that  the therapeutic 
indication for which an accelerated assessment was requested is a confirmed ultra-rare disease of 
potentially life-threatening nature and imposing a significant burden on the patient’s quality of life. 
Given that  no adequate treatments for the condition currently exist there is a high unmet  medical need 
for an effective treatment. 
However, during the  procedure, the applicant decided to revert to  standard timetable to  address the 
CHMP  questions. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as a solution for injection containing 10  mg/mL of setmelanotide as

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General  information 
The chemical name of setmelanotide is acetyl-L-arginyl-L-cysteinyl-D-alanyl-L-histidinyl-D-
phenylalanyl-L-arginyl-L-tryptophanyl-L-cysteinamide cyclic (2→8)-disulfide corresponding to  the 
molecular formula C49H68N18O9S2. The free base has a relative molecular mass of 1117.3  g/mol and the 
following structure: 
Figure 2: active  substance structure 
The chemical structure of setmelanotide is inferred from the sequential amino acid coupling  process 
and was confirmed by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry (MS),  IR spectroscopy and UV 
spectroscopy. Amino acid sequence was confirmed by MS/MS and the stereochemistry of each 
component amino acid was determined by chiral GC-MS. 
The solid-state properties were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning 
calorimetry and dynamic vapour sorption. Setmelanotide is a white  to off-white powder. 
Setmelanotide contains 8  chiral centres. Enantiomeric purity of the  individual amino acids is controlled 
in the starting  material specifications. 
Manufacture,  characterisation and process controls 
Setmelanotide is synthesized in multiple steps followed by preparative chromatographic purification 
using well-defined starting materials with  acceptable specifications. The starting materials were 
redefined to protected amino acid monomers and dimers during the procedure as a result of a CHMP 
major objection, in line with  earlier scientific advice. 
There are multiple  manufacturers for specific stages of the manufacturing  process. The process 
consists of a series of peptide coupling reactions followed by cyclisation to  form the disulfide bridge. 
Impurities are removed by several chromatographic purifications. The purification steps can be 
repeated as described in the dossier to ensure adequate purity of intermediates and the active 
substance. The cyclisation and purification steps are considered critical for both  preventing formation 
of impurities and purging them. The optimisation of these processes has been discussed at length 
including impurity  spike and purge studies and elution profiles for key impurities. The manufacturing 
processes conducted at the  different sites are slightly different to accommodate the different 
equipment. However, it has been shown that  the active substance produced is of comparable and 
suitable quality, irrespective of the site at which it  is produced. 
An additional manufacturing site was added to the  dossier to ensure a robust supply of active 
substance considering the extensive cycle time for manufacture. In the  initial submission, there was 
limited information available including  batch data on the  process as conducted at this  site. Given the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/319064/2021 
Page 19/143 
 
 
 
 
re-definition of starting materials and introduction  of an intermediate manufacturer, some outstanding 
activities need to  be carried out  post-approval but prior to commercialisation. Active substance lots 
manufactured using RSM-1 and RSM-2 will only be commercialized after the process is validated at the 
commercial batch size and using the  validation approach laid down  in the dossier. In addition, the  first 
batch of active substance made with  RSM-1 and RSM-2 will  be placed on stability. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting  materials and reagents have been presented. Some intermediate 
specifications do not  contain limits on unspecified impurities and limits  for several impurities are 
considered rather broad. Therefore, the applicant should review the current impurity limits for 
intermediates RSM-1, RSM-2, crude 1-8L, purified 1-8L  and crude 1-8C once additional lots are 
produced at commercial scale and revise the acceptance limits  accordingly. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in  accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with 
regards to their origin and characterised. 
The active substance is packaged in high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles closed with  poly-
propylene screw caps. The bottles are placed in  heat-sealed aluminium pouches. The primary 
packaging complies with the  EC directive 2002/72/EC  and EC 10/2011  as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identity, colour and clarity of solution 
(Ph. Eur.), assay , peptide related impurities , non-peptide related impurities , acetate content , water 
content (KF),  residual solvents (GC, HPLC), elemental impurities (ICP-MS), microbial limits (Ph.  Eur.) 
and bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.). 
The initially proposed specification was considered deficient in multiple  aspects resulting in  a major 
objection from CHMP.  In response, the applicant updated the specification by tightening  limits  for 
various impurities, adding tests for colour and clarity of solution, and updating the  overall control 
strategy to ensure that  the process routinely delivers active substance of suitable quality,  irrespective 
of the manufacturing site. The revised specification is considered to be acceptable. However, the 
proposed limits for colour and clarity of the solution should be properly justified based on results from 
at least 3 consecutive commercial scale active substance batches when available, as well as results at 
the end of the re-test period for stability batches. 
Limits  for peptide related impurities are set in line with  Ph. Eur. 2034 (substances for pharmaceutical 
use) and the demonstrated capability of the manufacturing process. The potentially genotoxic impurity 
is controlled in line with  ICH M7 with  a limit in the  active substance specification. Residual solvents are 
controlled according to ICH Q3C. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in  accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data on 3 production scale batches of the active substance from each manufacturer are 
provided. Initially, limited  data from the second manufacturing  site was submitted  resulting in a major 
objection. In response, the applicant provided satisfactory data from additional batches. The results 
are within  the specifications and consistent from batch  to batch, irrespective of the  active substance 
manufacturer.

Stability 
Stability studies were conducted with  production scale batches of active substance from both 
manufacturers packaged in a container closure system that  is representative of the proposed 
commercial container closure system. The following parameters were tested: appearance, assay, 
impurities, acetate content, water content  and microbial limits. The analytical methods used were the 
same as for release and are stability indicating. 
At the first manufacturing site,  primary stability studies have been conducted using  batches of active 
substance manufactured according to  the registered process stored at  -20°C, 5°C for up to 36 months 
(both long-term conditions)  and 25°C/60% RH  for up to 6 months(accelerated conditions). Supportive 
data was provided on further batches manufactured using an earlier process stored at -25°C,  5°C for 
up to 36  months and 25°C/60% RH  for up to 6  months (accelerated). No significant trends were 
observed to any of the measured attributes  and all parameters met the specification limits in  place at 
the time of testing. 
One active substance batch was subjected to forced degradation studies under stressed conditions 
including acidic, alkaline, oxidative, thermal and ICH Q1B photolytic conditions.  The active substance 
has been shown to be unstable under most stressed conditions and is photosensitive. The chosen 
primary packaging provides sufficient protection from light. 
Based on a linear regression analysis for the different measured parameters, all properties are stable 
up to the  end of the stability  study and a re-test period of 36  months is proposed for active substance 
manufactured at  the first manufacturing site when stored at -20 ± 5°C in  the proposed container 
closure system. 
The manufacturing processes used at the two  sites are slightly different, resulting in slightly different 
impurity profiles based on the limited batch data available. Therefore, assigning a re-test period for the 
second site batches required standalone stability data. At the  second site, stability studies results are 
presented on one batch stored up to 12 months at -20°C  and 5°C (both long term conditions) and up 
to 6 months  at 25°C/60% RH  (accelerated conditions). Stability studies are further presented for two 
more batches, up to the  5-month time point  under all conditions.  Samples were tested according to  the 
same protocol used at  both sites. Given the limited  data available, regression analysis doesn’t provide 
meaningful results. Therefore, no extrapolation of stability  data is possible. The results to date 
nonetheless indicate that  active substance manufactured at the second site has an equivalent stability 
profile to  that manufactured at the first site. Based on assessment of the currently available stability 
data, a retest period of 6 months is proposed for the active substance manufactured at  the second site 
when stored at -20° ± 5°C  in the proposed container closure system. 
The stability results indicate that  the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. The stability  results justify the proposed re-test period for the first site of 36 months 
at -20°  ± 5°C in the proposed container closure system. For active substance manufactured at the 
second site, a re-test of 6 months at -20°  ± 5°C in the proposed container closure system is applied. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the  product and Pharmaceutical development 
Imcivree is a sterile, preserved, clear to slightly  opalescent and colourless to slightly coloured solution 
for once a day subcutaneous (SC) injection presented in a multi-dose vial.

The Applicant has established a quality target product profile (QTPP) which was a preserved aqueous, 
relatively low-viscous, solution  of the setmelanotide with  one or more ion pairing agents (each with 
known safety profile) that is suitable for once-a-day SC injection and exhibits acceptable stability. 
CMC has a history of use as viscolyzer in parenteral and SC preparations and mPEG-2000-DSPE is 
approved for use in other controlled release products marketed in the EU.  Pre-clinical PK studies 
demonstrated that formulations containing combinations of the excipients mPEG-2000-DSPE and CMC 
resulted in the desired setmelanotide PK profile following SC injection. 
The final quantitative composition in mPEG-2000-DSPE was set on the  basis of the pre-clinical PK 
studies. The concentrations of the  antimicrobial preservatives phenol and benzyl alcohol have been 
optimised based on the effective levels seen in preservative efficacy test (PET) studies and are 
acceptable from safety point of view also for children aged ≥6 years. 
All excipients, except mPEG-2000-DSPE, are controlled in accordance with  the respective current Ph. 
Eur. monographs and some additional  limits for microbial limits and bacterial endotoxins (BET) are 
included. Since the  mPEG-2000-DSPE has already been approved for parenteral use in the  EU, it is 
considered a non-compendial, non-novel excipient. Suitable information has been provided in  the 
dossier for mPEG-2000-DSPE including  details of the  manufacturing process, characterization, 
impurities, specifications, analytical methods, validation of analytical methods, container closure 
system, reference standards and stability  data. The list  of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the 
SmPC and in paragraph 2.2.1  of this report. 
In accordance with the quality EU  scientific advice, the applicant generated a set of development data 
to demonstrate that the  assay values of mPEG-2000-DSPE as well as the molecular weight distribution 
of both ion pairing agents do not significantly change upon finished product storage. 
In the initial  submission, it  was unclear how the applied control strategy would ensure consistent 
prolonged release behaviour of the active substance, resulting in a major objection. In response, the 
applicant explained how the applied control strategy ensures the desired PK properties without  the 
need for a bespoke release test. The controls consist of a test  for setmelanotide assay, an excess of 
mPEG-2000-DSPE controlled by the amount charged and an assay test in  the finished product, 
ensuring pH remains within  the  defined range as determined by both  an IPC and a release test, and 
fixed charges of CMC, phenol and benzyl alcohol. Batches manufactured within  these parameters (and 
slightly wider ranges in some cases) were investigated in vivo and found to exhibit consistent  PK 
profiles, indicating  that  the control strategy is effective in ensuring the prolonged release properties. 
The container closure system consists of a type 1 glass vial with  bromobutyl grey stopper and an 
aluminium cap. The materials comply with  Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container 
closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the 
product. There is an overfill of 0.1 mL in  order to achieve the nominal fill volume of 1 mL and a 
nitrogen head space. Injection volumes of 0.05  to 0.3  mL (based on the posology as proposed by the 
Applicant) are withdrawn  using a commercially available 1 mL  plastic syringe and 28G or 29G needle 
(which are not co-packed with  the product). Dose accuracy studies according to ISO 7886-1  ‘Sterile 
hypodermic syringes for single use – Part 1 Syringes for manual use’ demonstrate that  these syringes 
fitted  with 28G x ½ inch needle are suitable for the  administration of Imcivree solution for injection.  
The chosen multi-dose presentation is not ideal given the  daily dosing, long term use and potential  for 
self-administration (adult patients).  It is to be noted, however, that  the applicant has initiated the 
development of a once-a-week injectable formulation presented in single-dose pre-filled syringes. 
Given the unmet  medical need and PRIME status,  the multi-dose vial presentation is considered 
appropriate until  a longer acting formulation is developed.

The manufacturing process consists of compounding followed by sterile filtration  and aseptic filling.  The 
choice of sterilisation method is imposed by the nature of the active substance and excipients. Risk 
assessments were performed to evaluate the  impact of the  different manufacturing steps on the 
finished product critical quality attributes  (CQAs). The dissolution of the mPEG-2000-DSPE, the 
sterilizing filtration  and the aseptic filling  are deemed critical process steps. The dispersion method for 
mPEG-2000-DSPE was optimised to  ensure full dissolution and homogeneity without  causing excessive 
foaming. A pre-filtration  step is performed prior to the sterilizing filtration  to mitigate the  risk of 
clogging of the sterilising filter due to the insoluble stearic acid impurity of the mPEG-2000-DSPE 
material. The link between the manufacturing process risk assessment and the  final control strategy 
consisting of critical process parameters and controls has been explained and is considered acceptable. 
The influence of the source of active substance on the finished product quality was verified. Finished 
product batches were shown to be of consistent quality compared to the development batches, 
irrespective of the  source of active substance. 
Manufacture  of the  product and process controls 
The manufacturing process and in  process controls consists of 4 main steps: sequential addition of 
excipients and the  active substance to water for injections (WFI)  to generate a solution; sterile 
filtration;  aseptic filling;  stoppering and crimping. The process is considered to be a non-standard 
manufacturing process. The manufacturing site, process, process parameters, scale, equipment and 
controls for commercial manufacture are overall the same as for the manufacture of the pivotal clinical 
finished product batches and primary stability  batches. 
The critical process parameters and critical in-process controls together with  their acceptance criteria 
are provided and are generally acceptable. The microbiological control of the finished product 
manufacturing process is appropriately addressed. Bioburden of the bulk solution is determined before 
sterilizing filtration.  Both of the sterilizing filters are tested for integrity before use and at least one of 
them is tested and must comply after the sterilizing  filtration. Satisfactory media fill validation has 
been confirmed. The sterilization and depyrogenation of the primary packaging components are 
satisfactorily described. Filter validation results and extractables/leachables data for the sterilizing  
filters are presented. 
The applicant originally proposed a concurrent validation approach given the PRIME status and unmet 
medical need. Although this  approach was endorsed, the associated validation protocol was not 
adequate and no actual validation data was submitted, resulting in  a major objection. In response, the 
applicant provided a detailed process validation scheme foreseeing extended analytical testing 
throughout  the different manufacturing steps. In addition,  satisfactory data was presented on three 
process validation batches according to this protocol. The data submitted is considered sufficient to 
support the proposed hold time limit  from compounding to  completion of bioburden reduction filtration. 
For one of the  validation batches, the process was challenged by holding the batch  during the filtration 
step. This had no impact on the assay of any components or impurity levels but  did result in a slight 
discolouration of the  bulk which  wasn’t subsequently reflected in the colour of the filled vials. In order 
to avoid this slight  discolouration, the applicant  is recommended to clearly define in the dossier the 
volume of solution to  be discarded from the prefilter after a prolonged solution filling  stop. This will be 
further checked during manufacture of a 4th process validation batch. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form 
including appearance, colour and clarity of solution (Ph. Eur.), identification,  identification of 
carmellose sodium (USP), identification  and assay of mPEG-2000-DSPE , assay of setmelanotide , 
peptide related impurities,  phenol identity  and assay, benzyl alcohol identity and assay, pH (Ph. Eur.), 
Assessment report

extractable volume (Ph.  Eur.), osmolality (Ph. Eur.),  particulate matter (Ph. Eur.), sterility (Ph. Eur.) 
and bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.). 
During the procedure, the applicant was asked to introduce an in vitro release test to ensure the 
prolonged release characteristics of the formulation. This is in line with  provided scientific advice and 
was raised as a major objection. In response, the applicant was able to  demonstrate that  the overall 
control strategy ensures a consistent  in vivo release profile as evidenced by PK data in  multiple 
patients from multiple batches of finished product used throughout  clinical development. The control 
strategy consists of: 
•  Correct setmelanotide content to  ensure the ion-pair is formed consistently is controlled by 
assay in the release specifications; 
• 
Identity and content of mPEG-2000-DSPE to ensure the setmelanotide ion-pair is formed 
consistently. This is ensured by charging a large molar excess of mPEG-2000-DSPE and by 
identity and assay tests in the release specifications.;  
•  Correct pH  to ensure ion pair formation consistency across the narrow pH  range which 
setmelanotide naturally buffers. This is ensured by an IPC and a release test for pH; 
• 
Presence of CMC is controlled through the  release specifications and the  amount charged is 
part of the process description; 
•  Correct phenol and benzyl alcohol content which  ensures homogeneity and hence PK 
properties. Phenol and benzyl alcohol assay are controlled in  the release specifications. 
This justification was accepted by CHMP.   
Overall, the finished product release and shelf-life specifications are acceptable. The applicant should 
nonetheless envisage the  use of the Ph. Eur. 2.2.2  instrumental method (method III) as described in 
Ph. Eur. volume 10.3,  implemented from 1st January 2021,  for colour evaluation instead of the 
currently used visual check. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the  finished product has been assessed following a 
risk-based approach in line with  the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data 
from 3  batches using a validated ICP-MS method was provided, demonstrating that  each relevant 
elemental impurity  was not  detected above 30%  of the respective PDE. Based on the risk assessment 
and the presented batch data, it  can be concluded that  no specific elemental impurity controls are 
needed. 
A risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in  the finished product was 
provided following a major objection from CHMP.  All known suspected and actual root causes were 
considered in line with  the “Questions and answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on 
the CHMP  Opinion for the  Article 5(3)  of Regulation (EC) No  726/2004  referral on nitrosamine 
impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020)  and the “Assessment report- Procedure 
under Article 5(3)  of Regulation EC (No)  726/2004-  Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal 
products” (EMA/369136/2020).  Based on the information provided, it  is accepted that  no risk was 
identified on the possible presence of nitrosamine impurities in the active substance or the related 
finished product. Therefore, no additional  control measures are deemed necessary. 
Results from extractables/leachables studies were presented. Given the  nature of the finished product 
and the proposed container closure system, which  is commonly used for aqueous parenteral products, 
the provided extractables/leachables studies are considered sufficient. Based on these studies,  it is 
concluded that there is no need for routine control of any leachables.

The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the  ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing  has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 8 production scale batches confirming the  consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 4 production scale batches of finished product stored for up  to 24 months under 
long term conditions (5°C) and for up to 12 months under accelerated conditions (25°C / 60%  RH) 
according to  the ICH guidelines were provided. 3 Batches were manufactured with  active substance 
from both  manufacturing sites. The batches of medicinal product are identical to those proposed for 
marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. Samples were tested for 
appearance, colour and clarity of solution,  pH, assay, peptide related impurities,  phenol potency and 
benzyl alcohol potency at every timepoint and osmolality, particulate matter, sterility,  extractable 
volume and bacterial endotoxin at less frequent intervals. The analytical procedures used are stability 
indicating. 
Under refrigerated conditions, no significant trends were observed to any of the measured parameters 
which all remained within  specification. Under accelerated conditions, there were out of specification 
(OOS) results for colour and clarity of solution at 9 and 12 months.  In addition,  there was a within-
specification reduction in assay and increase in 1 impurity. 
In  addition,  material was  exposed to  light  as  defined in  the  ICH  Guideline  on Photostability  Testing  of 
New Drug Substances and Products. The finished product is photosensitive but the cardboard carton was 
shown to provide sufficient protection  from light. 
Data from a simulated in-use study with  2 primary stability batches, of which one was 19  months old, 
and a satisfactory PET study support a 1 month  in-use shelf-life at  5°C and room temperature, even in 
absence of light protection.  In use conditions are included in  section 6.3  of the  SmPC as follows: 
“chemical and physical in use stability has been demonstrated for 28 days at 2 – 30°C. From a 
microbiological point  of view, once opened, the product may be stored for a maximum of 28 days at 2 
- 30°C. Other in use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user.” 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years stored “in a refrigerator (2°C to 
8°C) - do not  freeze - store in  the original carton in order to protect from light” as stated in the SmPC 
(sections 6.3 and 6.4) is acceptable. The same shelf-life applies irrespective of the source of active 
substance used to  manufacture the finished product. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn  lead to the  conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.

6 Major objections were raised during the evaluation procedure concerning the choice of starting 
materials, inadequate active substance release specifications, insufficient  batch data to support the 
second site as an active substance manufacturer, missing finished product process validation data and 
inadequate validation protocol, lack of a release test to ensure consistent  prolonged release 
characteristics and the missing nitrosamines risk evaluation. These were resolved by redefining the 
starting materials, amending the specifications, providing additional data from the  second site batches, 
providing validation data on 3 finished product batches and an updated process validation scheme and 
providing an adequate nitrosamines risk evaluation. The applicant demonstrated that the  overall 
control strategy ensures the prolonged release characteristics of the finished product and supported 
this with  consistent  PK data and therefore, no bespoke release test is deemed necessary. 
At the time of the CHMP  opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no 
impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product. These include justifying  the limits for colour and clarity 
of solution tests in the  active substance specification, revising the limits for impurities in active 
substance intermediates, validation of the active substance manufacturing process at the commercial 
scale at one manufacturer, defining the  volume of solution to discard from the pre-filter after a 
prolonged filling  stop and updating the method used to measure colour and clarity of solution in the 
finished product in line with  the European Pharmacopoeia. These points are put  forward and agreed as 
recommendations for future  quality development. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs  to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP  recommends the following points for investigation: 
•  Active substance lots manufactured using RSM-1 and RSM-2 should only be commercialized 
after the process is validated at the commercial batch size and using the validation approach 
laid down in the dossier. In addition,  the first batch of active substance made with  RSM-1 and 
RSM-2 should be placed on stability. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The applicant should review the current limits for specified and unspecified impurities for 
intermediates RSM-1, RSM-2, crude 1-8L, purified 1-8L  and crude 1-8C once additional lots are 
produced at commercial scale and revise the acceptance limits  accordingly. 
The proposed limits for colour and clarity of the  solution in the active substance specification 
should be properly justified based on results from at least 3 consecutive commercial scale 
active substance batches when available, as well as results at the end of the re-test period for 
stability batches. 
The applicant is should clearly define in the dossier the volume of solution to be discarded from 
the pre-filter after a prolonged solution filling stop in the  finished product manufacturing 
process. This should be further checked during manufacture of a 4th process validation batch. 
The applicant should envisage the use of the Ph. Eur. 2.2.2  instrumental method (method  III) 
as described in Ph. Eur. volume 10.3,  which is implemented from 1st January 2021,  for colour 
evaluation of the finished product.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Both in vitro and in vivo non-clinical studies were performed to characterise the primary 
pharmacodynamics of setmelanotide. Furthermore, the potential for off target effects of setmelanotide 
was investigated in vitro and additional observations were reported in the primary pharmacology study 
conducted in obese rhesus monkeys. These included potential effects of the activations of MC4R 
pathways such as increased stretching,  yawning, muscular stiffness, and penile erection (Argiolas et 
al., 2000;  Martin and MacIntyre, 2004);  skin hyper-pigmentation induced by setmelatonide; and 
adverse effects that  could result in  confounding factors in regard to food intake e.g headaches, 
asthenia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Several efficacy and cardiovascular pharmacodynamic 
studies were conducted in parallel with a comparator MC4R agonist i.e. LY2112688.   
GLP-compliant safety pharmacology studies were conducted to evaluate potential adverse effects of 
setmelanotide on the respiratory and central nervous systems after a single 24h  SC infusion in  male 
Sprague-Dawley rats. The potential adverse effects of setmelanotide on the  cardiovascular (CV) 
system included a GLP-compliant in vitro assay on cloned hERG potassium channel. A GLP in vivo 
cardiovascular safety study was also conducted in telemetered male and female cynomolgus monkey. 
Additional safety pharmacology data derived from informative CV studies in rhesus monkeys, rats and 
minipigs.  
Studies have also been performed to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK), toxicokinetics (TK), 
absorption, distribution,  metabolism and excretion (ADME) of setmelanotide.  Setmelanotide was 
dosed by single or multiple  dose administration via intravenous (IV) injection, subcutaneous (SC) 
injection or SC infusion to mice, rats, rabbits and monkeys.  
Repeat-dose toxicity studies were performed up to 13-week in both rats and monkeys with  continuous 
SC infusion of setmelanotide in saline, as well as up to 6 months  in rats and 9  months in monkeys with 
SC injection of setmelanotide in mPEG-DSPE or in saline. The standard battery of genotoxicity tests 
was done. 26  week carcinogenicity data (rat, mice) and fertility and embryo-fetal development studies, 
local tolerance data were also submitted. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro, Setmelanotide binds to several human melanocortin receptors (hMCRs),  and preferentially 
recognizes human melanocortin 4 receptor (hMC4R), with  a Ki of 2.1  nM and an EC50 of 0.27 nM  in 
the Gαs/adenylyl cyclase signalling mediated cAMP accumulation assay. It is about 20-fold less potent 
in activating the  human melanocortin (MC)  receptors-1 and -3 (EC50: 5.8nM  and 5.3nM,  respectively). 
At the melanocortin 5 receptor (MC5R) it  has an EC50  of >1  μM and displays no activity at the  human 
melanocortin 2 receptor (MC2R). Setmelanotide induced accumulation of cAMP through MC4R-coupled 
Gαs-protein is fully blocked by an MC4R antagonist. 
To allow cross-species comparison, the in  vitro efficacy of setmelanotide at  all the  five melanocortin 
receptors (MCRs) from various species used in  the nonclinical studies was further evaluated. 
Specifically, the ability of setmelanotide to induce cAMP accumulation was evaluated in transiently 
transfected HEK293 cells with  MCRs from mouse, rat, cynomolgus monkey, rhesus macaque, dog and 
human.  The EC50s of setmelanotide at MC4Rs of the 6  species were within  a comparable range (0.21 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/319064/2021 
Page 27/143 
 
 
 
to 3.05  nM). Similarly, the EC50s at MC3Rs was also comparable (range: 0.39 to  1.31 nM). With 
MC1Rs of the 6 species, the  EC50s ranged 0.83 to  26.6 nM.  No stimulation  of transiently expressed 
MC5Rs of human, mouse and rat was observed, while dog, cynomolgus, and rhesus MC5R were 
stimulated by setmelanotide with EC50  of 2.5,  7.9, and 29.25  nM, respectively. Setmelanotide did  not 
stimulate MC2R  (ACTH receptor) of all these 6 species assayed. A recent in vitro potency study using 
transiently expressed receptors suggested that  setmelanotide could be marginally more efficacious at 
the cynomolgus MC1R  (EC50=7.20  nM) than  the rhesus MC1R (EC50=26.6  nM.  Under similar assay 
conditions, the EC50  of setmelanotide at human MC1R was 1.73  nM. 
A study was performed to evaluate if in-vitro pharmacology of setmelanotide differs from two 
comparator agents the natural ligand alpha-MSH and LY2112688  (another MC4R  compound that 
showed acute increases in heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) in humans) in  activating the Gαs 
(cAMP accumulation) or the  phospholipase C (NFAT reporter assay) pathways using cell transfected 
with  the hMC4R. For  the Gαs signalling,  setmelanotide was about 5-fold more potent  than α-MSH  or 
LY2112688.  Setmelanotide was about 50- to 100-fold  more potent in the  NFAT signalling assay 
compared to α-MSH  or LY2112688.  In addition,  the setmelanotide induced NFAT activation could not 
be blocked by the  antagonist Agouti-related peptide (AGRP), whereas both α-MSH  and LY2112688 
effects were completely blocked. The clinical relevance of this, or the implication  with respect to 
cardiovascular safety in the clinical setting remains unclear. 
In vivo, the primary pharmacology studies were performed in lean and diet-induced obese (DIO) 
rodent (rat and mouse) and Rhesus monkey models to establish the effects of setmelanotide on food 
intake and body weight.  Metabolic parameters, such as improvement of glucose tolerance and insulin 
sensitivity were also investigated.  The efficacy of setmelanotide was also studied in the dog as well as 
in two  genetic models of obesity in rodents. These includes the leptin-receptor deficient Zucker fa/fa 
rats (a rodent model of genetic obesity impacting the  MC4R pathway) and the Magel2-null  mice (a 
mouse model for Prader-Willi syndrome, or PWS). Different dosing schedules were tested (SC once 
daily morning or evening, up  to 3 times daily) in  rats.  SC infusion was used in 7 primary 
pharmacology studies with the  saline formulation of setmelanotide. 
In lean and DIO mice administered setmelanotide by SC infusion, a dose-related decrease in body 
weight  gain relative to vehicle control was seen across all dose groups (0.22 to  2.00 mg/kg/day) 
throughout  the 14-day treatment period whereas in lean mice, the effect on body weight  was 
transient, occurring over the first 4 days with  partial recovery by Day 14.  
The setmelanotide-mediated decrease in body weight  was even more pronounced in DIO Sprague-
Dawley rats (0.08 to  1.34 mg/kg/day; SC infusion for 14 days) and persisted after cessation of dosing 
for at least 7  days. A dose-related decrease in food intake relative to  vehicle was also seen in  lean and 
obese rats, the effect being more pronounced in obese animals. 
MC4R+/+  mice treated with  setmelanotide (1.34 mg/kg/day) elicited weight  loss, while MC4R-/- mice 
treated under the  same conditions gained comparable amount of weight  to their vehicle-treated 
controls. 
Support for the  use of setmelanotide was also shown in genetic obesity models. In the Zucker rat 
model of leptin-receptor mutation  SC infusion of setmelanotide was highly effective at  decreasing the 
rate of body weight gain and suppressing appetite at both doses tested (0.06  or 0.56 mg/kg/day; for 7 
days). Similarly, in the Magel2-null  mouse, acute intraperitoneal administration of setmelanotide (0.04 
to 1 mg/kg) was found to be significantly efficacious in appetite suppression at all the  doses 
investigated when compared with  the Wild-type (WT) mouse. 
In normal beagle dog, SC injection of setmelanotide at doses of 150  to 4500  nmol/kg/day (0.17 to  5.0 
mg/kg/day) for 3 consecutive days resulted in a progressive dose-dependent decrease in body weight 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/319064/2021 
Page 28/143 
 
 
 
which correlated with  dose-related decreases in food consumption. At the  end of a 4- or 5- day 
washout period, total or partial recovery was noted.  
In rhesus monkeys, SC infusion of setmelanotide at 0.5  mg/kg/day gave rise to decreased food 
consumption in lean animals, and this  dose was used in DIO animals. In those obese monkeys, a -
13.5%  loss in total  body weight  was noted over the 8-week treatment  period. This finding was 
contributed by increased energy expenditure since early drop in food intake was seen reversing back to 
baseline during weeks 4  through 7 and even showed a modest increase from baseline during week 8. 
After cessation of treatment, there was a slow return of body weight  to baseline by 10-12  weeks post-
dose. Decreases in triglycerides, cholesterol, free fatty acids and fat mass and improving glucose 
homeostasis, insulin  sensitivity, and leptin levels were also noted. The effects of setmelanotide on food 
intake were significantly greater than  those seen with  the comparator MC4R agonist, LY2112688,  at 
the same dose level.  
Independent of its  effects on body weight  gain and food intake, setmelanotide acts as an insulin 
sensitizer, with setmelanotide treatment resulting in  increased glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity 
in both  Sprague-Dawley rats and non-human  primates, even in  the absence of weight  loss. These 
effects were not apparent in MC4R knockout mice treated with  setmelanotide, providing evidence that 
the effects of setmelanotide on insulin and glucose are due to its action on the MC4R.  In DIO mice, 
concurrent with inhibiting  feeding, decreasing body weight  and fat mass, setmelanotide improved 
glucose clearance, and enhances both hepatic and peripheral insulin  sensitivity. 
Overall, in diet-induced obese rodent and Rhesus monkey models the decreases in food intake, body 
weight,  and fat  mass, were seen shortly after initiation  of chronic setmelanotide treatment. The effects 
were marked and persisted after cessation of treatment.  In addition,  the weight  loss effects were also 
associated with  decreased adiposity, increased energy expenditure and improved glucose homeostasis 
and increased insulin sensitivity.  
In lean animals the pharmacological effects of setmelanotide in reducing body weight  was noted but 
lower when compared with obese animals. Both the prolonged stability of setmelanotide and the 5-fold 
higher potency than  the endogenous ligand alpha-MSH  in an efficacy assay, are anticipated to translate 
into its  superior efficacy over alpha-MSH in animal models where endogenous alpha-MSH is expected 
to be expressed. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Towards a panel of 71  receptors and 16  enzymes at a concentration of 1 μM,  ligand binding was 
inhibited  by 20-50%  at 5 receptors (muscarinic, neurokinin-2, sigma, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, 
and GABA transporter), and by 59% at opioid receptors. As the clinical Cmax for unbound 
setmelanotide (approximately 38 ng/mL or 0.034 μM)  is around 55-fold less, the  relevance of the off-
target binding observed is considered limited.  
In the rhesus monkey study, no behaviour signs linked to MC4R pathway activation, like yawning, 
stretching, muscular stiffness and penile erection were identified. Likewise, there was no skin tanning 
or coat colour changes.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
In those studies, there were no test article-related effects on any functional  observation battery (FOB) 
or respiratory parameters at doses up to  120 mg/kg, resulting in ~ 290-fold  higher exposure levels as 
compared to the Cmax and AUC (37.9  ng/mL and 576 ng•hr/mL)  values in the clinic at  the maximum 
recommended daily dose of 3 mg. The doses tested in  the respiratory and CNS safety pharmacology 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/319064/2021 
Page 29/143 
 
 
 
studies were 50-  to 250-fold higher than  those used in the weight  loss studies in normal and DIO 
rodents. 
In an in vitro assay on cloned hERG potassium channel, the IC50 was estimated to be greater than 0.3 
mg/mL (~ 0.3  mM). Knowing  that the free concentration of setmelanotide in the clinic for the 
therapeutic dose of 3 mg is ~290  fold lower than the  10 μM  concentration of setmelanotide that had a 
negligible effect on hERG, the risk for QTc prolongation in humans is considered very low. 
In the GLP in vivo cardiovascular safety study conducted in telemetered male and female cynomolgus 
monkey administered setmelanotide by continuous SC infusion  for three days at doses up to  25 
mg/kg/day, there were no biologically or toxicologically significant  test item-related effects on 
hemodynamic or ECG parameters. This dose resulted in a 187- and 259-fold  safety margin as 
compared to the human Cmax and AUC at the maximum recommended dose of 3  mg/day.  Such a 
dose also corresponded to 50-fold the dose that  produced marked weight  loss in the  8-week obese 
Rhesus monkey efficacy study without  producing any effects on HR or PB neither acutely nor 
chronically. 
Likewise, in an informative non-GLP study, no cardiovascular findings were noted in obese Rhesus 
monkeys in a one-week crossover study comparing setmelanotide to LY2112688  (both  at 0.5 mg/kg 
due to comparable molecular weight).  Unlike setmelanotide, LY2112688  was shown to increase HR and 
BP in  this model. The lack of cardiovascular finding in obese Rhesus monkey was also confirmed when 
setmelanotide was continuously SC infused for 8-weeks.  
In contrast to the primates, an increase in HR and mean BP was observed in the rat following  single or 
repeated SC bolus administration  of setmelanotide, which  were of similar magnitude to  the changes 
observed with the  comparator LY2112688.  Moreover, it appeared that  the increase observed in HR and 
BP in  the rat given setmelanotide were linked to an increase in sympathetic tone since the 
pharmacological inhibition  of a and b receptors was able to antagonise the cardiovascular effect of the 
drug.  
In a minipig study, increased HR (approximately 23.4%)  was also observed following SC doses of 0.5 
mg/kg either by bolus injection or by infusion. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
In a published study  (Clemmensen et al., 2015), the  co-administration of liraglutide  (a GLP-1 receptor 
agonist) and setmelanotide treatment in DIO mice showed improvement in body weight  loss and 
enhanced glycaemic control and cholesterol metabolism beyond what  can be achieved with  either 
mono-therapy. The superior metabolic efficacy is attributed to  the anorectic and glycaemic actions of 
both drugs, along with  the ability of setmelanotide to  increase energy expenditure.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
During development, the setmelanotide formulation and delivery methods were changed. Initially, 
setmelanotide was administered by a SC 24-h continuous  infusion, formulated in saline. Revised 
formulations and mode of administration included saline, mPEG-DSPE, and mPEG-DSPE for SC bolus 
injection, as well as mPEG-DSPE with  a preservative for SC bolus injection. At no point in development 
was setmelanotide conjugated to mPEG-DSPE, rather mPEG-DSPE was a component of the 
formulation. The final formulation used for the pivotal clinical studies is the mPEG-DSPE for SC bolus 
injection, with  and without  preservative. Thus, the conclusions on the PK of setmelanotide in the non-
clinical species described in this  section primarily focus on studies using the mPEG-DSPE formulation or 
studies supporting its  use.

In addition, to further characterise the PK profile of the component mPEG-DSPE used in  the final 
formulation, a dedicated ADME study using radio-labelled mPEG-DSPE was performed in the rat. 
Absorption and plasma pharmacokinetics 
The absolute SC bioavailability of setmelanotide was high  (76 - 85%),  as determined in a radiolabelled 
PK study comparing IV and SC administration to rats at a dose of 2 mg/kg. 
The PK/TK parameters of setmelanotide as mPEG-DSPE formulation have been investigated in GLP- 
compliant toxicity studies following single and multiple daily SC injection at  dose up to 3 mg/kg for 26 
weeks in the Sprague Dawley rat and at dose up to 1 mg/kg/day for the 39 weeks in the Cynomolgus 
monkey. In both species, the volume of distribution  and plasma clearance were high, with  a relatively 
short half-life. 
In the 26-week rat toxicity, the clearance (CLss/F) ranged from 0.338  to 0.512 L/h/kg  for males and 
from 0.742  to 1.54  L/h/kg for females. The volume of distribution  (Vz/F)  values ranged from 5.06 to 
14.7  L/kg for males and from 3.22 to 9.44  L/kg for females. Half-life  ranged from 7.20  to 19.9  h for 
males and from 1.55 to 5.69  h for females.  
In the 39-week monkey study, mean CLss/F ranged from 0.0842  to 0.216  L/h/kg, Vz/F ranged from 
0.563  to 1.19 L/kg, and t½  ranged from 2.49 h to  17.6 h. 
To support the mouse carcinogenicity study, the TK parameters of setmelanotide were also determined 
in the WT rasH2 mouse following daily SC injection of setmelanotide as mPEG-DSPE formulation at 
doses up to  20 mg/kg/day for 28 days. 
Following  repeated SC injection of setmelanotide in mPEG-DSPE in mice, rats and monkeys, systemic 
exposure was generally close to dose proportional, although variable the Cmax increased in a less than 
dose proportional manner whereas AUC increased mainly in a dose proportional manner with  the 
increase in dose. 
Though not considered significant,  in the mouse and rat repeat-dose toxicity studies, the  exposure 
levels of setmelanotide (Cmax and AUC) were overall higher in  males as compared to  females, 
following SC injection of setmelanotide independently of the formulation of the  test item investigated 
(mPEG-DSPE or saline). No  such a gender effect was noted in the cynomolgus monkey. Likewise, in 
human no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of setmelanotide were observed 
based on sex.  
In the mouse administered SC injection of setmelanotide in mPEG-DSPE no significant increase in 
exposure was noted following  repeated dosing as compared to day 1. In the chronic rat study,  the 
systemic accumulation ratio (Rac) was variable and ranged from 1.10  to 3.85.  Similarly, in the 39-
week toxicity study conducted in the  cynomolgus monkey the Rac values ranged from 0.276  to 3.81.   
Overall these data indicated no or limited accumulation after repeated SC injection  of setmelanotide in 
mPEG-DSPE in the mouse, rat and monkey for both males and females. 
In the repeat-dose toxicity studies conducted in the mouse, rat and monkey following SC injection of 
setmelanotide in mPEG-DSPE, there was no evidence of potential neutralising anti-drug  antibodies 
(ADA), except for two  samples from the 6-  month Tg.rasH2 mouse carcinogenicity study. 
A single-dose crossover study in cynomolgus monkeys was performed to assess the PK of 
setmelanotide formulated in mPEG-DSPE with  and without  the preservatives i.e. benzyl alcohol (10 
mg/mL), phenol (5 mg/mL)  and disodium edetate (1 mg/mL)  when administered by SC injection  at a 
dose of 5 mg/kg. The results demonstrated that  the preservatives did not impact the  PK of 
setmelanotide.

Distribution   
No in vitro data comparing the  distribution profile of setmelanotide in blood cells vs plasma from 
animal species and human are available. In vivo, the blood:plasma ratios calculated from AUClast were 
0.89  and 0.81  in male and female Sprague Dawley rats, respectively after a SC injection of 
radiolabelled setmelanotide at  2 mg/kg.   
Using the equilibrium dialysis method, the plasma protein binding  of setmelanotide appeared to be 
comparable across human and the  different animal species investigated (mouse, rat, rabbit, and 
monkey) ranging from 76.3  to 82.4%.   
The tissue distribution  and tissue PK of [14C]-setmelanotide-derived radioactivity following a single SC 
(bolus) dose were investigated in male and female Sprague Dawley rats and male Long Evans (LE)  rats 
for 168h and 504h respectively, using quantitative  whole-body autoradiography methods.  
In the Sprague Dawley rat, the highest  exposure was noted in the kidney that is consistent  with the 
urine primary path of excretion, followed by moderately high concentrations and exposures 
comparable to the plasma and whole blood in the liver and lung  of males and females, as well as in the 
uterus and ovaries. The lowest radioactivity and exposure were observed in the brain and eye. The 
tissue:plasma ratios for kidney were as high as 37, confirming that  [14C]-setmelanotide and/or its 
metabolites are highly concentrated in the kidney. All other tissue:plasma ratios demonstrated limited 
affinity for remaining tissue types. There were no substantial  differences in plasma or whole blood 
concentrations over the first 168 hours post-dose for the LE  rat as compared to the  non-pigmented 
Sprague Dawley rat. In LE rats, [14C]-  setmelanotide was detected in the lens and uveal tract up to 
504 hours post-dose, indicating that  the compound has an affinity for pigmented tissue. The measured 
concentrations in uveal tract during  168 to 504  hours ranged 63-71 ng/g tissue  which was slightly 
above the 59.1  ng/g limit of quantitation,  and the concentration in the  lens during  the same period was 
64-103  ng/g tissue. These concentrations were comparable as the whole blood range of 51-73 ng/g 
tissue during the same period.  No toxicological concern was identified regarding accumulation in eye, 
as repeat dose toxicity studies in monkeys and rats did not reveal any ophthalmic  findings.  
As part of a pre/postnatal development toxicity study, setmelanotide was found to  be excreted in the 
milk of lactating  rats that received repeated SC injection of setmelanotide in mPEG-DSPE at 0.5,  3 or 5 
mg/kg starting on gestation day 6. This observation was adequately reported under section 4.6 of the 
SmPC of Imcivree. 
Placental transfer has not been investigated for setmelanotide. Since this compound is extensively 
distributed  to tissues in both albino and pigmented rats, there is a high likelihood of placental transfer 
and embryo-foetal exposure in utero. In the SmPC it has been reflected that  setmelanotide should not 
be used during pregnancy, as a precautionary matter, based on the results of the embryofoetal 
development toxicity study conducted in the rabbit.   
Metabolism 
Setmelanotide was found to be stable in human, rat and monkey liver and kidney microsomes as well 
as in human, rat and monkey hepatocytes. Moreover, setmelanotide was not degraded by Hs68,  a cell 
line of human skin fibroblasts. 
In the rat administered [14C]-setmelanotide, analysis of the plasma samples indicated  that parent 
compound accounted for 76% to 95%  of the measured radioactivity. The primary metabolite of 
setmelanotide in plasma was M19  (3 to 12%)  of measured radioactivity (ROI). Two additional 
metabolites not present in urine were M16  (0.4 to 7%  ROI) and M17  (0.1 to 6%  ROI). 
Nineteen metabolites of setmelanotide plus parent drug were identified  in various rat excreta extracts, 
primarily the urine. Four metabolites present at > 5% of dose in  the urine, were M7  (0 to 14% of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/319064/2021 
Page 32/143 
 
 
 
 
dose), M10 (1  to 11% of dose), M12  (2 to  11% of dose), and M19  (14 to 59%  of dose). Parent 
setmelanotide was present at 4 to 29%  of dose.  
The metabolite M19 was identified as setmelanotide that  had undergone hydrolysis at the  C-terminal 
amide to  a free carboxylic acid. M12  resulted from further hydrolysis of M19,  cleavage of the  peptide 
chain, and acetylation. M7 resulted from further hydrolysis of M19,  cleavage of the peptide chain, and 
loss of tryptophan.  M10 was from further hydrolysis of M19  with  the loss of the side chain of histidine. 
M14  (1 to 4% of dose) and M15  (1 to  3% of dose) can both arise from cleavage of the peptide chain 
via hydrolysis at  different locations within  the chain. 
Of the above rat metabolites, only M19,  was found to have activity on human MC1R,  MC3R, and MC4R 
in vitro. Compared to setmelanotide it was about 10-fold less potent at both  MC4R and MC3R while 
being 3-fold less potent  at MC1R. The other metabolites were inactive on MC4R and MC3R and 10- to 
600-fold less potent than  setmelanotide on MC1R.   
Excretion 
Greater than 90%  of the  dose administered was recovered in urine, feces, and cage rinse from male 
and female rats over 168 hours following a single SC or IV dose of [14C]-setmelanotide at  2 mg/kg. 
The majority of the excreted [14C]-setmelanotide was recovered in the urine, and < 10% was 
recovered in the faeces regardless of dose route. In the Bile-duct cannulated animals given a SC dose, 
urine was the major route of excretion (82.7%),  as compared to faeces (4.3%)  and bile (1.9%)  over 
48 h post-dose. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
No single dose toxicology studies were conducted which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Several changes in formulations were introduced during the toxicological testing programme in rats 
and monkeys due to  convenience of treatment regimen and subsequent local intolerability observed at 
the infusion/injection  site in test animals. In human, setmelanotide is intended to  be administered with 
mPEG-DSPE formulation by SC injection, and therefore the repeat-dose toxicity studies with  SC 
injection of Setmelanotide in mPEG-DSPE are the most relevant studies. The applicant is currently 
working on a second-generation formulation which  would permit an even longer dose interval (e.g. 
possibly weekly), with the  possibility to  avoid the use of mPEG-DSPE.  
In both rats and monkeys, no systemic toxicities were identified in  repeat-dose toxicity studies at  any 
dose of setmelanotide in saline or setmelanotide in mPEG-DSPE.  
In the repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and monkeys, local injection site inflammatory reactions 
were observed with  administration of setmelanotide formulated in mPEG-DSPE and in saline, as well as 
in the vehicle mPEG-DSPE control group. The increased incidence and/or severity of injection sites 
reactions were related to increased mPEG-DSPE volume and increased setmelanotide concentrations. 
These effects were therefore considered related primarily to mPEG-DSPE with  some involvement of 
setmelanotide at high doses. The injection site reactions were generally mild and partially reversible 
(except fibrosis and thickening), and the macroscopic observations were generally correlated to 
microscopic changes. The injection site reactions were considered non-adverse at doses up to up to  3 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/319064/2021 
Page 33/143 
 
 
 
mg/kg in rats and at  3/1 mg/kg/day in monkeys, which  corresponds to exposure margins of 9 and 26 
in rats and monkeys, respectively, based on AUC for setmelanotide and to dose margins of 9.5 and 
6.5, respectively, based on mg/m2/day for mPEG-DSPE. In the clinical studies, injection site reactions 
were also observed at high frequency and were typically mild  in severity, short of duration  and 
tolerated by the  patients. 
In the repeat dose studies, setmelanotide related decreases in body weight, food consumption or body 
weight  gain was not  consistently observed across sex, dosing groups and species. Some effects on 
body weight  gain was observed, even statistically significantly in some treated groups. Therefore, the 
expected effects on body weight and food intake in  the toxicity studies (conducted in normal (lean) 
animals), were of minor magnitude in spite of higher doses used in the  toxicity setting, compared to 
both diet-induced  and genetic obesity models used in PD studies.   
Potential vacuolisation in the brain of adult  rats and monkeys were investigated after 6 and 9 months 
repeat dosing, respectively, using the diluted  formulation of mPEG-DSPE. This was in accordance with 
the CHMP  advice. In the 26-week study in rats, minimal vacuolation related to the mPEG-DSPE vehicle 
was observed in the  epithelial cells of the choroid plexus with  sporadic incidence (9/117 animals) in all 
mPEG-DSPE groups +/-  setmelanotide with  no mPEG-DSPE dose-volume dependency. In the 39-week 
study in monkeys, vacuolated (foamy) macrophages aggregates of minimal severity were observed in 
the choroid plexus of all animals treated with  formulations containing mPEG-DSPE. In contrast to rats, 
no vacuolation was observed in the epithelial cells in the brain. After a period of 4-week recovery, the 
vacuolation findings  were still  observed in female rats and in all monkeys. In both rats and monkeys, 
no distortion of brain tissue, no evidence of any other microscopic changes in the brains and no 
evidence of functional changes in the  brain were observed. The pathology peer-review confirmed that 
no treatment-related vacuolation were observed in other tissues in adult  rats and monkeys, except at 
injection sites. The additional immunohistochemical staining with  an anti-PEG antibody showed that  no 
staining for PEG was observed in the choroid plexus of either species, but the presence of pegylated 
material in these vacuoles cannot be ruled out since potential limitations  of the  immunostaining 
procedure and the location in the choroid plexus. The evaluation of the absorption, distribution, 
metabolism and elimination  of mPEG-DSPE in rat using  14C-mPEG-DSPE (labelled on mPEG only) 
showed that the  concentration in  the choroid plexus was below the  quantitation  limit at 24  hours, 2 
weeks, 7 weeks and 14 weeks after the 7th  dose for the majority of the animals. No sign of 
vacuolation in  the choroid plexus was observed in juvenile rats during 7  weeks of dosing of mPEG-
DSPE up to  3 mg/kg/day, corresponding to a dose margin for mPEG-DSPE of 14 times on mg/m2/day 
basis assuming 40  kg body weight in paediatric patients, at the  clinical dose of 2 mg.  
Hyperpigmentation (darkening) of skin on the muzzle and periorbital region that correlated 
microscopically with increased epidermal pigment  consistent with  melanin has been observed in all 
setmelanotide studies conducted in cynomolgus monkeys at all doses tested. Increased pigmentation 
was also observed in the conjunctiva with  continuous SC infusion  of Setmelanotide, but clear 
differences between control and treated animals were not apparent histologically due to  a high  degree 
of pigmentation at this  site in control animals. Hyperpigmentation was not  observed in other 
pigmented tissues, including retina. After recovery period, the facial hyperpigmentation was improved 
but  not totally reversible.  
In the 26-week study in rats, skeletal muscle myofiber degeneration/regeneration was observed and 
considered treatment-related. This adverse effect was considered related to be an extension of local 
injection site irritation,  was minimal in  severity and reversible. The skeletal muscle myofiber 
degeneration/regeneration was observed with very low incidence at doses up to  3 mg/kg, but  with 
higher incidence (10  of 29  rats) at 15 mg/kg with setmelanotide in saline (exposure margin of 49 
based on AUC at the clinical dose of 3 mg/day). The other neuromuscular changes observed in other 
studies were not  considered related to study treatment.  In the clinical studies, mild muscle soreness

and moderate cramping were observed in one heterozygous POMC patient  but were transient  and both 
AEs recovered/resolved. The available non-clinical and clinical data suggest that neuromuscular toxicity 
is not a major concern in  the indicated patient population.   
Genotoxicity 
The data from the standard battery of genotoxicity assessments, in line with  ICH S2(R1), indicated 
that  Setmelanotide does not  present a genotoxic hazard to humans. 
Carcinogenicity 
The carcinogenic potential of setmelanotide/mPEG-DSPE was investigated in hemizygous Tg.rasH2 
mice following SC administration during  26 weeks in three independent studies, due to technical issues 
in the first (erroneous randomisation) and second (malfunction  of the water supply system) studies. 
However, these issues did not impact the outcome or conclusions of the study.  
In the three 26-week carcinogenicity studies, there were no increase in mortality and no neoplastic 
changes attributed  to the  daily subcutaneous administration of setmelanotide in  mPEG/DSPE at doses 
up to 10  mg/kg/day for up to  6 months. In addition, setmelanotide has exhibited no genotoxic activity 
and has not been associated with  increased hypertrophic, hyperplastic, or preneoplastic tissue changes 
in the repeat-dose toxicity studies in both  rats and monkeys. The non-neoplastic changes at the 
injection sites observed in these studies were also observed in the repeat-dose toxicity studies and are 
related to  mPEG and/or Setmelanotide.  
In the first 26-week carcinogenicity study in Tg.rasH2 mice, black staining  on fur was observed starting 
from day 156 at ≥  1 mg/kg/day Setmelanotide with  dose-dependency and with  generalized 
appearance at 10 mg/kg/day. The observed black staining on fur is likely related to  the off-target 
effect at MC1 receptors, as observed in monkeys and human. In the third  carcinogenicity study (RM-
493-TOX-045),  black staining  on fur was observed but only on day 77 in 4/25  female. In the second 
carcinogenicity study (RM-493-TOX-044),  black staining on fur/skin was also observed but a summary 
table should be provided. In addition, the difference between the three carcinogenicity studies for the 
occurrence of black staining on fur/skin should be discussed.  
Reproduction Toxicity 
The fertility and embryo-fetal developmental studies in rats showed no evidence of setmelanotide-
related effects on male or female fertility, maternal toxicity and teratogenic effects. The safety margins 
based on AUC for setmelanotide in mPEG-DSPE are at least 9 for fertility and 7 for the risk of 
teratogenicity, at the clinical dose of 3 mg. The dose margin for the mPEG-DSPE vehicle is at least 9.5-
fold on a mg/m2/day basis.  
In the embryo-fetal developmental study, the rabbits were extremely sensitive to the primary 
pharmacodynamic effect of setmelanotide which  lead to severe reductions in food consumption  during 
the treatment period. By consequence, increased embryo-fetal resorptions and post-implantation  loss 
were observed at setmelanotide exposure level of approximately 0.4-times human AUC and mPEG-
DSPE dose margin of 0.15 on a mg/m2/day basis. The maternal toxicity effects observed in rabbits 
may not  be relevant to humans. No teratogenic effect was observed in rabbits at doses up to 0.2 
mg/kg/day, which  corresponds to safety margin of 1.5  based on AUC and a dose margin for mPEG-
DSPE of 0.6-fold on a mg/m2/day basis. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/319064/2021 
Page 35/143 
 
 
 
In rats, no maternal toxicity or adverse effects on F1 offspring were observed in a pre- and postnatal 
development study at setmelanotide exposure levels up to 7-times human AUC and mPEG-DSPE dose 
margin of 16  on a mg/m2/day basis.  
Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetic data were collected from pharmacokinetics or toxicology studies and the data are 
presented in the  previous sections. 
Local Tolerance  
In all repeat-dose studies in monkeys and rats treated with  setmelanotide, local intolerability was 
observed with differing severity depending on the  tested type of formulation, where setmelanotide 
formulated in undiluted mPEG-DSPE caused the most severe reactions locally at the injection site. 
Local effects such as edema, swelling and thickened skin as well as clinical pathological signs of 
inflammation have been observed at the  injection site in all studies, regardless of vehicle formulation 
used. 
Other toxicity studies 
Two separate studies on local reactions were performed for different formulations containing 
setmelanotide. The studies confirmed the findings in the general toxicological studies that  mPEG-DSPE 
formulations generally induce more severe local reactions than saline formulations and that 
setmelanotide seems to have a contributory effect on local reactions at high  concentrations. In the two 
studies, the mPEG-DSPE vehicle was deemed the vehicle to be best tolerated, despite also giving rise 
to local injection site reactions. other formulations were also investigated, which lead to more severe 
local reactions compared to saline.  
Setmelanotide consists of a number of impurities, which  have been included the  drug substance 
specification, such as peptide related impurities as well as residual solvents and elemental impurities. 
Most  impurities are below the qualification limit  according to ICH Q3A and are controlled during 
manufacturing.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Setmelanotide, an analogue of α-MSH,  is a MC4R agonist indicated for the treatment of obesity and the 
control of hunger associated with biallelic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) or leptin receptor (LEPR) 
deficiency. 
Setmelanotide binds to  several human hMCRs, and preferentially recognizes human melanocortin type 
4 receptor (hMC4R),  It is about 20-fold less potent in activating  MC1R and MC3R. 
In vitro, similar binding  affinity and/or EC50s were observed for human, rodent (rat and mouse), dog, 
and non-human primates (rhesus and cynomolgus) MC4R.  Among those species the EC50  values for 
the MC1R and MC3R  were comparable. For the MC5R of human, mouse and rat setmelanotide showed 
no agonist activity whereas a >10-fold lower activity as compared to the  target MC4R was noted for 
the MC5R of the dog and the non-human primates.  All together, these data showed that  the rat and 
the non-human primates (NHP)  but also the mouse and the dog are all pharmacologically relevant 
animal species for the safety assessment of setmelanotide. 
No specific rationale for choosing the  cynomolgus monkey was provided. The rhesus monkey in the 
toxicology studies, was presented but  it may have been more logical to  have used the  same NHP in 
both pharmacology and toxicity studies. Also, in  view of the in vitro efficacy data and consistent with 
the 3R principle, the dog should have been preferred as the non-rodent species rather than  the 
cynomolgus monkey for the pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies.   
In vivo, the non-clinical efficacy studies in diet-induced  obese rodent and Rhesus monkey models as 
well as in genetic models of obesity, including  leptin-receptor deficient Zucker fa/fa rats confirmed the 
MC4R-mediated pharmacological effect of setmelanotide in decreasing body weight  and food intake. In 
those obese models (diet  induced or genetic models), it was furthermore demonstrated that 
setmelanotide had beneficial effects with  respect to  improved insulin and glucose parameters. In a 
MC4R knock-out mouse model, it was shown that  MC4R+/+  mice treated with  setmelanotide exhibited 
weight  loss, while MC4R-/-  mice did  not show similar effects, but rather were similar compared to 
vehicle treated animals with respect to body weight  gain. In the primary pharmacology studies, only 
the saline formulation of setmelanotide was used, and no studies were performed with the mPEG-DSPE 
formulation. As the final formulation is rarely finished at the  time of nonclinical proof of concept this  is 
not considered to be an issue, and the safety of the excipient has been established in  the toxicology 
studies. 
In vitro screening for potential  off-target effect showed that  setmelanotide inhibited  ligand binding by 
20%-50%  at 5 receptors (muscarinic, neurokinin-2, sigma, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, and GABA 
transporter), and by ~60%  at opioid receptors.  
In addition, the inhibitory  effect occurred at higher (50-fold) concentration as compared to the 
exposure level achieved in the clinic for the planned therapeutic dose. 
In the rhesus monkey study, no behaviour signs linked to MC4R pathway activation were identified. 
Likewise, there was no skin tanning or coat colour changes. This is in contrast with  the skin findings 
observed in all the toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkey where facial hyperpigmentation associated 
microscopically with increased epidermal pigment  consistent with  melanin, was noted following SC 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/319064/2021 
Page 37/143 
 
 
 
 
infusion or SC injection. This occurred with  all the dose levels of setmelanotide tested and with  both 
the saline and the mPEG-DSPE formulations. The effect of setmelanotide on skin pigmentation is 
considered related to  the off-target effect on the closely related melanocortin 1  receptor (MC1R). Since 
the primary pharmacodynamic study in the Rhesus monkey was not  GLP compliant but  only involved 
limited cage-side observation a definitive statement about the  presence or absence of the 
hyperpigmentation cannot be confirmed. Skin hyperpigmentation has been observed in the clinical 
setting.  In addition, skin hyperpigmentation is an identified risk in the RMP and is included in the SmPC 
as a very common adverse reaction (see 2.6.1). 
In line with  the ICHS7 guideline, GLP-compliant safety pharmacology studies with  setmelanotide 
included assessment of the respiratory and CNS functions  in the rat, in vitro hERG channel, and in  vivo 
cardiovascular safety study in the cynomolgus monkey.  Those studies  did not raise safety concern.  
Adverse cardiovascular effects on HR and mean BP were however, observed in several rat studies 
following single or repeated SC bolus administration of setmelanotide, but they were counteracted by 
pre-treatment with  propranolol and terazosin (β and α1 blocker respectively). In a minipig  study, 
increased in HR was also observed following SC injection or infusion of setmelanotide. Since the  safety 
pharmacology studies performed in rats and non-rodents (monkeys and minipig), does not produce a 
clear picture of the effects of setmelanotide on HR and BP, the  cardiovascular effects observed in other 
species besides the cynomolgus, was recommended to be describe briefly in the  5.3 section of SmPC.  
In the clinical setting,  no adverse cardiovascular effects and no evidence of increased heart rate and 
blood pressure were identified in the limited  number of patients administered setmelanotide at the 
proposed therapeutic daily dose of 3 mg. However, in view of the rat findings and the fact that  MC4R 
agonists are linked to an increase in sympathetic tone, a pharmacodynamic effect on HR  and BP can be 
anticipated.  Hence recommendations to monitor heart rate and blood pressure in case of overdose 
have been further included in the section 4.9 of the SmPC, the  clinical long-term safety and tolerability 
of setmelanotide being unknown and considered as missing information. 
In the non-clinical pharmacokinetic studies, the species and strains reflect also those employed in the 
toxicological evaluation of setmelanotide, thus  enabling assessment of the  exposure levels of the 
parent compound in  the toxicology studies to support the  safe administration to humans.  
The PK after both single and repeat dosing appear well described in all species and an approximately 
dose proportional relationship was observed with slight signs of accumulation. Some gender differences 
in setmelanotide exposure (AUC and Cmax) were observed following SC injection in the rat, the 
exposure levels being overall higher in males as compared to females; however, they were not 
considered significant. No  such a gender effect was noted in the cynomolgus monkey. No ADA was 
found in rats, monkeys, mice or rabbits.  
Distribution of setmelanotide was evaluated in adult Sprague Dawley and LE  rats. There was no 
substantial difference in plasma or whole blood concentrations over the first 168 hours post-dose for 
the pigmented LE  rat as compared to the non-pigmented Sprague Dawley rat. In addition,  there 
appeared to be no difference in binding  to pigmented or non-pigmented skin. However, in LE rats, 
[14C]- setmelanotide was detected in the lens and uveal tract up to 504  hours post-dose, indicating 
that  the compound has an affinity for pigmented tissue. Setmelanotide being a peptide no potential for 
phototoxicity is anticipated.  
Placental transfer was not investigated for setmelanotide.  However, in  view of the extensive 
distribution  of the compound to  tissues in both albino and pigmented rats, placental transfer and 
embryo-foetal exposure in utero are likely. 
The ADME study for setmelanotide was performed in the  rat as the rat was one of the  species chosen 
for the pivotal toxicological studies. No data was available for the  in vivo metabolic pathways and

excretion in monkeys. The absence of ADME study in  this species was justified based on the chemical 
structure of setmelanotide as well as on the 3R principle. As setmelanotide is a cyclic peptide, the 
primary metabolites are expected to be proteolytic hydrolysis products and smaller peptides and amino 
acids, which due to their low molecular weight  are expected to be cleared renally. In the rat, of the 
four main metabolites of setmelanotide identified in the urine, only the metabolites M19 and M17,  were 
quantified in human urine samples.  In vitro M19  was pharmacologically active on human MC4R,  MC1R, 
and MC3R but  it was less potent  than the parent compound. The metabolites of setmelanotide 
identified to date in the  rat support this mechanistic metabolism path. 
Plasma was not assessed for determination of metabolites in human whereas only two metabolites, 
M19  and M17, were quantifiable in urine of few patients  administered setmelanotide for 12  weeks. In 
none of the  pivotal toxicity studies  conducted with  setmelanotide were the TK parameters of the 
systemic metabolites determined. In the absence of human exposure data for the circulating 
metabolites, it is not  possible to draw conclusion on the non-clinical characterisation of metabolite 
toxicity. Nevertheless, unlike the classical small chemical drug, setmelanotide, as an octapeptide, is 
not expected to  show metabolism that  differs greatly from species to species. The main 
pharmacologically active compound is the parent drug, which  has been comprehensively evaluated in 
the toxicology studies.  In addition,  the main metabolite in rats, M19,  had a 10-fold lower activity on 
MC1R, MC3R  and MC4R  than setmelanotide, whereas the other metabolites were >1000-fold  less 
active. Overall the available non-clinical data does not indicate potential  issues linked to the 
metabolism of setmelanotide.   
The toxicology package presented is in line with  the requirements under the relevant guidelines (ICH 
M3  and S6) and with  due consideration to the  proposed posologyAn LC-MS/MS and ELISA methods 
were developed to measure setmelanotide and anti-setmelanotide antibody (ADA) in rat, mice, 
monkey and rat serum, respectively, in support of the GLP pivotal toxicological studies. The LC-MS/MS 
method were validated across the concentrations ranging from 5.0 to  2000 ng/mL. The accuracy and 
precision of within-run  and between-run values was acceptable and in line with  relevant guidance 
(EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009  Rev. 1 Corr. 2). Furthermore, dilution integrity  as well as long-term 
stability and stability  during freeze thaw cycles was sufficiently addressed. The method for detecting 
ADA in the different plasma samples was considered sufficiently validated. Incurred sample reanalysis 
was investigated in all toxicological species. 
In the repeat-dose toxicity studies, no systemic toxicities were identified at any dose of setmelanotide. 
Local injection site inflammatory reactions were observed and were considered related primarily to 
mPEG-DSPE with  some involvement of setmelanotide at high doses. Similar findings were observed in 
the clinical studies and are included in the  SmPC. In the repeat dose studies conducted in  normal 
(lean) animals, the  expected effects of setmelanotide on body weight and food intake were of minor 
magnitude in spite of higher doses used, compared to both diet-induced and genetic obesity models 
used in pharmacology studies. Hyperpigmentation of skin on the muzzle and periorbital region that 
correlated microscopically with increased epidermal pigment consistent  with  melanin has been 
observed in all setmelanotide studies conducted in cynomolgus monkeys at all doses tested. The skin 
darkening is considered as an exaggerated pharmacological off-target effect of setmelanotide at the 
MC1 receptor and has also been observed in a very high  proportion of patients in clinical studies. In 
the repeat-dose toxicity studies, adverse effects on the neuro-muscular system were observed in the 
26-week rat study with higher incidence at exposure margin of 49 at the  clinical dose of 3 mg/day, but 
no other neuromuscular changes related to study treatment were observed in the other toxicities 
studies.  
Minimal  vacuolation in the choroid plexus related to the mPEG-DSPE vehicle were observed in the 
epithelial cells with sporadic incidence in the 26-week study in rats and in the macrophages of all 
animals in the 39-week study in monkeys. The vacuolation findings were still  observed in female rats 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/319064/2021 
Page 39/143 
 
 
 
and in all monkeys after 4-week recovery period. Taking into account (i) the minimal severity of 
vacuolation observed sporadically in the brain of rats, (ii) the absence of vacuolation in the  epithelial 
cells in the brain of monkeys, (iii)  the absence of vacuolation in other tissues in adult animal species, 
(iv) the absence of accumulation of mPEG-DSPE in  the brain observed in rat study using 14C-mPEG-
DSPE, (v) the absence of adverse effects on brain function and (vi) the high clinical need in the 
targeted population, the potential  risks of vacuolation in the  brain of paediatric/adult subjects is low 
and considered acceptable. The vacuolation findings in  the choroid plexus of rats and monkeys have 
been briefly described in section 5.3 of the SmPC. 
The data from the standard battery of genotoxicity assessments, in line with  ICH S2(R1), indicated 
that  Setmelanotide does not  present a genotoxic hazard to humans. 
The available carcinogenicity data in Tg.rasH2 mice indicate that  setmelanotide/mPEG-DSPE does not 
pose a carcinogenic risk to  patients, with  a safety margin of 17  for setmelanotide based on AUC and a 
dose margin of 16 for mPEG-DSPE on a mg/m2/day basis, at the  clinical dose of 3 mg/day.  
Setmelanotide/mPEG-DSPE meets the criteria for a 2-year rat study waiver as set forth in ICH 
guideline S1 Regulatory notice on changes to core guideline on rodent carcinogenicity testing  of 
pharmaceuticals (EMA/CHMP/ICH/536328/2013  Rev. 1) based on the following weight  of evidence 
approach: (i)  Setmelanotide/mPEG-DSPE is not genotoxic, (ii) no histopathological evidence of cellular 
hypertrophy, hyperplasia, dysplasia, preneoplastic changes, or neoplasia in any toxicity study, (iii) 
activation of MC1R protects melanocytes against the genotoxic effects of ultraviolet light and (v) no 
malignant melanomas or cutaneous malignancies were reported in clinical trials. Melanoma is specified 
in the risk management plan as an important potential risk and routine  risk measures are included in 
SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8 as well as in the Package Leaflet (full  body skin examinations prior to 
initiating  treatment and during treatment  to monitor pre-existing and new skin pigmentary lesions).  
Setmelanotide did  not show effects on fertility or teratogenicity, nor was any systemic effects observed 
in the juvenile toxicity studies, specifically no effects related to vacuolisation of the choroid plexus.  
Additional toxicity studies supported mPEG-DSPE formulation as best tolerated vehicle, despite giving 
rise to  local injection site reactions. The applicant claimed that  other formulations were also 
investigated, which led to more severe local reactions compared to saline formulation, however no data 
or comparison were made available to support this  statement.  
The available non-clinical data in toxicity studies revealed no evidence of antigenicity in mice, rats, 
monkeys or rabbits.The absence of immunotoxicity study is considered acceptable, as no evidence of 
immunotoxicity was observed in the repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and monkeys. 
The secondary in vitro pharmacodynamics studies showed that  setmelanotide competitively inhibited 
ligand binding to  the opioid receptor, at concentration of free setmelanotide 55-fold  higher than  the 
concentration reached in the clinical setting  and at the therapeutic dose of 3 mg. In the repeat-dose 
toxicity studies in rats and monkeys, no signs of drug withdrawal were observed during post-treatment 
periods. In addition,  setmelanotide is a large molecule and distribution  studies shows limited 
penetration into the  brain. Additional investigation  is not  deemed necessary and the absence of 
dependence studies is considered acceptable. 
The absence of phototoxicity  studies is considered acceptable in line with  ICH S10. In the  distribution 
study in LE  rats, accumulation in  the pigmented tissue in eyes were observed, however, no ophthalmic 
findings were observed in repeat dose toxicity studies in monkeys and rats. Hyperpigmentation of the 
muzzle was observed in all studies and dose-levels in monkeys; however, this was likely related to  the 
pharmacological action of setmelanotide and not due to phototoxicity. 
The estimation of the LogD of setmelanotide has been investigated at pH 5.5  and pH 7.4,  but not at  pH 
9. In addition, the  study on determination of the octanol water partition  coefficient at pH5.5  had some 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/319064/2021 
Page 40/143 
 
 
 
major lacks in quality.  However, the LogD at pH9  is estimated to be in  the same range taking into 
account that  the pKa of setmelanotide is >13   and the probability for an exceedance of the logD 
trigger regarding the requirement of a bioaccumulation assessment is negligible low.  No additional 
studies have been therefore requested. Setmelanotide and the  excipient mPEG-DSPE-2000 are not 
expected to pose a risk to the environment.  
Setmelanotide and the excipient mPEG-DSPE-2000 are not expected to  pose a risk to the environment.  
Assessment of paediatric data on non-clinical aspects 
In accordance with the nonclinical requirements of the paediatric investigation plan for setmelanotide, 
the applicant also conducted a study with  the radiolabelled mPEG-DSPE (20  mg/kg/day) in order to 
determine the  concentration of [14C]-mPEG2000-DSPE equivalents in the blood, plasma, and choroid 
plexus in  the rat after single and repeated SC bolus administration  for up to  7 weeks.  
In this study, the  concentration in blood and plasma was generally below quantitation  limit  whereas in 
tissues the concentration of [14C]-mPEG2000-DSPE-derived radioactivity was highest in  the injection 
site after single dose administration, or last dose administration site  with repeat dosing. The 
concentration in the choroid plexus was below the quantitation  limit  at 2 weeks and 7 weeks after the 
7th  dose for all animals except 1 female that had a high concentration that  was inconsistent  with  all 
other measurements, including those at preceding time points. These data suggested limited uptake of 
[14C]-mPEG2000-DSPE in the  choroid plexus following  7 weeks of SC administration. 
The design of the juvenile study in rats supports the administration of setmelanotide in  paediatric 
population from 6 years to 17 years. The adverse findings observed in the 7-week juvenile study in 
rats were related to the pharmacological activity of setmelanotide (body weight, food consumption) 
and to injection site reactions, which were similar to those observed in adult rats. At the No Observed 
Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) of 3 mg/kg/day for setmelanotide/mPEG-DSPE, based on the clinical 
exposure observed at 2 mg in paediatric patients, the  safety margin for setmelanotide in mPEG-DSPE 
is 18 based on AUC and the dose margin for mPEG-DSPE is 14  on mg/m2/day basis assuming 40 kg 
body weight.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The overall pharmacokinetic data to  support this application for setmelanotide are relatively complex 
due to the fact that  throughout  the clinical studies three different formulations and two different 
administration routes with  both body weight-adjusted and fixed dosing have been used.  
During the clinical development program, setmelanotide was initially administered with  body weight-
adjusted (mg/kg) dosing, and subsequently on a fixed-dose basis (mg). Body weight-adjusted  dosing 
was used in  a total  of 2 clinical studies (RM-493-001  and RM-493-002),  administered as a SC infusion. 
Single and multiple  doses ranging from 0.0025  mg/kg/24 hour to 0.1  mg/kg/24 hours were 
investigated (range 0.12  to 9.1 mg/day). 
The change from body weight-adjusted  dosing to  fixed dosing of setmelanotide was made following 
Studies RM-493-001  and RM-493-002,  in which the weights  of the  obese subjects were fairly uniform, 
averaging ~100 kg, so that  the mean (range) of daily drug administration was 0.913  (0.72 – 1.2) 
mg/24 hours. To simplify the  dosing regimen, fixed doses were used in all subsequent studies  including 
1 Phase 1 (RM-493-008),  multiple  Phase 2 studies (RM-493-009,  RM-493-010,  RM-493-011,  RM-493-
014),  2 Phase 3 studies (RM-493-012  and RM-493-015),  and an open-label extension study (RM-493-
022). 
The first 4 clinical studies, (RM-493-001,  RM-493-002,  RM-493-003,  and RM-493-006)  used a 
setmelanotide sterile saline solution formulation, administered as a 24-hour subcutaneous (SC) 
infusion, and in 3 studies as an SC injection (RM-493-001,  RM-493-002,  RM-493-008).  Subsequently, 
a sterile setmelanotide preparation for injection containing setmelanotide/mPEG-DSPE was developed, 
which allowed once daily (QD) treatment. Study RM-493-008  was conducted to investigate the PK, 
safety and tolerability of setmelanotide/mPEG-DSPE as well as study the relative PK comparability of 
SC injection of setmelanotide/mPEG-DSPE to setmelanotide-saline. This study showed that  the PK 
properties of this early formulation were significantly different from those obtained with the  mPEG-
DSPE formulation. Therefore, these early studies with the  saline-based formulation will  not be 
discussed in the  present report. However, they have been considered in the secondary pharmacology 
analyses. All clinical studies conducted thereafter, including the  pivotal studies (RM-493-012,  RM-493-
015)  as well as Phase 1b and Phase 2 studies (RM-493-009,  RM-493-010,  RM-493-011,  RM-493-014, 
and RM-493-026)  were conducted with setmelanotide/mPEG-DSPE formulation, which is the  intended 
commercial material. Setmelanotide-saline formulation is no longer in use. 
Early during the  conduct of Studies RM-493-012  (Phase 3, POMC) and RM-493-014  (Phase 2, rare 
genetic obesity), a preservative-free mPEG-DSPE formulation was used. Further in  the product 
development, preservatives were added to the mPEG/DSPE formulation to support multi-dose  vials. 
Study RM-493-026  included an assessment of the steady-state safety, tolerability, and PK of 
setmelanotide/mPEG-DSPE preserved formulation administered by SC injection QD to healthy obese 
subjects. Some of the initial patients  in Studies RM-493-012  and RM-493-014  were transferred from 
the preservative-free mPEG-DSPE formulation to the preserved mPEG-DSPE formulation.  
In addition, a POPPK model was conducted using mixed effects modelling for repeated-measures 
endpoints. The dataset was comprised of 120  subjects in  8 studies (RM-493-008,  -010,  -011,  -012, -
014,  -015, -026  and -022)  in healthy obese patients  or patients with  RGDO; a total  of 2711 
quantifiable PK observations were included.

Absorption  
Setmelanotide is characterised by a very low permeability based on in vitro experiments performed in 
TC7 human intestinal  epithelial cells and in MDCK cells. In vitro experiments in MDR1-MDCK, BCRP-
MDCK, and MDCK cells showed that setmelanotide is not a substrate of P-gp and BCRP.  
Concerning the  different administration  routes, the  SC infusion route was used in the first 4 clinical 
studies. Plasma setmelanotide concentrations in subjects receiving SC infusions reached a plateau by 
24 to 48  hours after starting the  infusion, suggesting that  steady state is achieved by 24 to 48 hours 
After completion of the 24-hour  continuous SC infusion  doses, setmelanotide exhibited two-
compartmental pharmacokinetics. A lag time was observed after continuous SC infusions of 
setmelanotide. Excluding the data for the  0.0025 mg/kg dose, the mean lag times ranged from 0.74 to 
6.0 hour. However, this administration route is less convenient in an outpatient  setting  in comparison 
with  a SC injection administration and, limited  data suggested that  the SC infusion dose was slightly 
suboptimal. A SC injection of the saline solution of setmelanotide was further tested but  found not 
appropriate for OD dosing. Therefore, a sterile preservative-free solution with  a pegylated phospholipid 
ion-pairing agent 1,2-disteroyl-phosphotidylethanolamine-methyl-pluethylene glycol 2000  conjugate 
(setmelanotide/mPEG-DSPE) was developed. Study RM-493-008  showed that  the PK properties of this 
new (mPEG-DSPE) formulation at a dose of 1.5 mg (SC injection) were significantly different from 
those obtained with  saline solution,  with a median Tmax increasing from 1h to 6h,  and, as such, 
decreasing the average Cmax value from 37.6  ng/mL to 18.9  ng/mL, while  the AUC0-24 values 
remained approximately similar.  
A clear trend towards a more readily absorption of the preserved formulation was found in comparison 
with  the non-preserved formulation, with  approximately 20% higher Cmax and AUC values. Although 
not based on a direct comparison in a dedicated clinical study,  this was confirmed in the POPPK 
analysis and falls within  the intra-subject variability.  
Overall, after SC injection of the preserved mPEG-DSPE formulation with  setmelanotide, steady-state 
plasma concentrations of setmelanotide increased slowly, reaching maximum concentrations at a 
median tmax of 8.0h  after dosing. The mean Cmax,ss and AUCtau for 3 mg QD was 37.9 ng/mL 
(%CoeffV 14.0)  and 495 h*ng/mL  (%CoeffV 16.8),  respectively (Study RM-493-026  –  healthy obese 
population). Mean setmelanotide trough concentration for 3.0 mg once daily was 6.77 ng/ml. 
Distribution 
The results obtained with  transfected HEK cell lines showed that  setmelanotide is neither a substrate of 
OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3 nor OCT2. The protein binding was determined using two different 
techniques: using ultrafiltration,  the bound fraction ranged from 45.5±  1.3 - 53.4±0.9%  for the tested 
concentrations 1 – 100 µM;  with  equilibrium dialysis the  bound fraction was 79.1%  at a tested 
concentration of 5 µM. 
The mean apparent volume of distribution  after SC administration of setmelanotide 3.0  mg QD is 
approximately 63 L.  
Elimination 
The effective elimination t1/2  of setmelanotide (mPEG-DSPE formulation with  preservative) is 
approximately 11 hours (Study RM-493-026).  The CL/F  value is 4.86 L/h.  Approximately 39% of the 
administered setmelanotide dose was excreted unchanged in urine during the 24-hour dosing interval 
following subcutaneous administration of 3 mg once daily. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/319064/2021 
Page 52/143 
 
 
 
In vitro experiments showed that  setmelanotide is not  a MATE1  substrate and a borderline MATE2K 
substrate.  
Only trace amounts of two urine metabolites, M19  and M7 (found in rat urines) were observed in a 
small number of subjects in study 4006777. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Despite a relatively high variability in PK parameters (due to the different formulations and 
administration routes used during the development), study RM-493-015  indicated dose proportionality 
following SC (mPEG-DSPE, preserved) injection at steady state in patients and it  could be seen that 
setmelanotide generally exhibited close to dose proportionality across doses and studies. 
Accumulation of setmelanotide in systemic circulation during QD dosing over 12 weeks was 
approximately 30% relative to the  first dose (after dose-normalization). This degree of accumulation is 
consistent with  a once-daily dosing regimen and an effective T1/2 of 11 h. An accumulation in AUC of 
20% to  30%, is also consistent  with a half-life observed through the clinical development of 
setmelanotide. The catabolic effects of weight  loss have not impacted the PK. 
Based on the POPPK model, the inter-subject variability is estimated to be 28.7%  and the  intrasubject 
variability 27.6%  which is considered as moderate. 
Special populations 
A specific phase I study in subjects with  renal impairment is ongoing (RM-493-029).  No dedicated 
study in hepatic impaired patients  has been undertaken by the applicant. However, in view of the fact 
that  setmelanotide is predominantly excreted by the kidneys, this is considered acceptable by the 
CHMP.  Other data related to renal function, age, weight, gender was derived from population 
pharmacokinetic (POPPK) analyses. During the procedure, additional data were also provided to assess 
other factors such as race/ethnicity. 
The effects of renal function  on the PK of setmelanotide were modelled using  estimates of creatinine 
clearance calculated from serum creatinine concentration together with age, sex, and body weight.  In 
this model, subjects with  mild renal impairment had a 0.852-fold  (0.701,  1.04)  lower CL/F  as 
compared to those with  normal renal function. Preliminary data from study RM-493-029  showed nearly 
2-fold increased half-life of setmelanotide and around 20% decreased clearance for mild as well as 
nearly 30% decrease in clearance for moderate renal impairment.  
The POPPK indicated that age was not a significant factor influencing clearance of setmelanotide but 
the strong relationship between age and weight  impacts recommendations for paediatric dosing. In 
addition, mean Ctrough levels at all doses were significantly lower for females in comparison with 
males (percent ratio female/male of the geometric means was 61%),  and were significantly below 5 
ng/mL which  was considered to be the  target level related to efficacy. This is further discussed in 
section 2.4.4. 
Additional data did not reveal any significant effects of race/ethnicity noting subjects were 
predominantly Caucasian (N=81)  or black (N=27)  in the clinical studies. 
The population PK model indicated that  age was not a significant factor influencing clearance of 
setmelanotide but a strong strong continuous correlation between weight  and PK parameters, resulting 
in higher exposure for lower weight and younger age was observed. This is further discussed in section 
2.4.4.

The pharmacokinetic profile setmelanotide in the elderly population has not been studied. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No specific drug-drug interaction studies have been performed. 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
In vitro data using  human biomaterials suggested that the  potential for setmelanotide to cause drug 
interactions may be considered as low.  
Direct CYP inhibition 
The inhibition  potential of setmelanotide to  inhibit  cytochrome P450 (CYP) was evaluated in  two 
studies. The first study used only one concentration of 1  mM setmelanotide showing greater IC50 
values of CYP inhibition   than  1 mM in four CYP isoforms CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19  and 2D6. In the  second 
study, only one concentration of setmelanotide (1.2 µM)  has been tested to investigate the direct 
inhibitory potential  of setmelanotide of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19,  2D6, 2E1 and 3A4/5 
enzymes. The 50 x the unbound Cmaxss is estimated to be approximately 0.357 µM  for a therapeutic 
dose of 3 mg once daily, the concentration of 1.2 µM  was thus deemed higher and not representative 
of the maximal concentrations expected in the liver. Although the methodology used is not  optimal and 
a range of concentrations should also normally be tested for direct CYP inhibition,  the results 
suggested a very low % of direct inhibition  for the  different isoenzymes at this higher concentration 
and only a weak inhibition  of CYP3A at 1.2 µM  is observed. 
Time-dependent inhibition 
The potential for time-dependent inhibition  (TDI) of cytochrome P450 (CYP) (CYP1A2, CYP2A6, 
CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A) in human liver microsomes (HLM) 
by setmelanotide was tested. The calculated IC50 values were greater than the  cut-off concentration 
calculated for the hepatocytes (0.36 µM)  thus  suggesting that there is no time-dependent inhibition  of 
any of the CYP enzymes by setmelanotide.  
Induction 
Setmelanotide did  not increase either mRNA or activity of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A at any of the 
three tested concentrations (0.05, 0.2,  and 0.5 μM)  in any of the tested human hepatocyte donors. 
The examination of mRNA levels showed <2-fold  vs. vehicle control. The activities in the three CYP 
isoforms were less than 20%  of positive control and were not  considered as positive for induction. 
Transporter inhibition 
The risk for drug-interactions through an inhibition  mechanism at the  level of investigated efflux 
transporters PgP and BCRP is unlikely at clinically relevant concentrations as no inhibitory  effects of 
more than  50% have been shown in MDR1-MDCK and BCRP-MDCK cells using digoxin and cladribine as 
probe substrates for P-gp and BCRP, respectively. The ratio of unbound  Cmax/IC50 is less than  0.02 
for BCRP and PgP and suggest no significant inhibition  of BCRP and PgP. 
Investigations using cell lines with  overexpression of the target genes did not reveal potential  for 
clinically relevant inhibition  of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3 and OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2K 
transporters.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Setmelanotide retains the specificity and functionality of the naturally occurring POMC-derived 
neuropeptide, alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (αMSH),  which is the natural ligand for MC4R. 
Therefore, setmelanotide has the potential  to restore lost activity in the POMC-MC4R  pathway by 
bypassing the  defects upstream of MC4R  and directly activating MC4R neurons in the hypothalamus, 
thus ameliorating the genetic defects in the critical signalling pathway that  regulate energy 
homeostasis and food intake in  humans.  
Setmelanotide may serve as a form of “replacement” therapy to re-establish weight  and appetite 
control in patients with  these monogenic disorders and is considered a selective MC4 receptor agonist. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
No specific patient pharmacodynamic studies were performed. Pharmacodynamic endpoints (e.g. the 
effect of setmelanotide on the degree of hunger experienced by the  patients, energy expenditure) were 
incorporated as secondary and tertiary endpoints in the pivotal efficacy and safety studies. This is 
considered acceptable by the CHMP given the ultra-rarity of the condition and thus  lack of available 
subjects. The effect of Setmelanotide on resting energy expenditure was  also evaluated in study RM-
493-006.   An increase in expenditure of 6.4% versus placebo was found and this  study showed a 
higher trending total  daily energy expenditure. Pharmacodynamic effects of setmelanotide on blood 
pressure, heart rate, ECG, skin pigmentation, administration  sites, anti-drug antibodies, depression 
and suicidal ideation have been investigated. 
No pharmacodynamics studies have been conducted in human subjects that  are relevant to dose 
selection. The proposed regimen has been derived entirely from the efficacy and safety results of 
clinical trials. 
Blood Pressure and Heart  Rate 
In Study RM-493-001,  crossover cohorts allowed a within-subject  comparison between setmelanotide 
and placebo. The average 24-hour mean values were analysed and supplementary data were derived 
from the  comparisons at multiples of the anticipated clinical dose (e.g., at  5x and 10x the anticipated 
clinical dose), and also at the Tmax timepoints  (i.e., 24-hours for the infusion and 3 hours for the 
injection). There were no clinically relevant or statistically  significant changes from baseline for any of 
the comparisons.  
24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) was incorporated into  Study RM-493-002  with 
3 full days of monitoring for each cohort: on baseline day, halfway through treatment and on the last 
dosing day. The data were reassuring in  2 ways. First,  the change from baseline in  the actively treated 
group on the last day of dosing (Day 28) clusters around the zero change line, indicating that  the 
setmelanotide group did not  show a change in SBP with  28 days of treatment  compared to baseline 
(i.e., within-subject  assessment). Second, the data for the active-treatment group were generally 
similar to the placebo group showing that  after setmelanotide treatment for 28 days there is no 
difference from placebo.  
An ABPM sub-study,  which included 20 full days of monitoring,  was also conducted at a subset of sites 
in Study RM-493-003.  The data revealed little if any differences in heart rate and blood pressure 
between the setmelanotide and placebo groups (analyses of both the entire 24-hour interval and the 
night  interval).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/319064/2021

Study RM-493-009  again included ABPM obtained twice,  once at baseline and once on Day 8-9. 
Analysis of change from baseline in systolic BP, diastolic BP and HR for all subjects with  both pre- and 
post-dose measurements showed no differences from placebo. 
ECG  
In Study RM-493-001  there were no clinically relevant or statistically  significant differences between 
setmelanotide and placebo with regard to the change from baseline in QTcB or QTcF. One placebo 
subject recorded a QTcB increase of >30  ms, ≤60 ms. 
Cardiac telemetry revealed no clinically relevant abnormalities after drug infusions had started. 
Similar analyses in Study RM-493-002  also showed no clinically relevant or statistically significant 
differences between setmelanotide and placebo with  regard to the change from baseline in QTcB or 
QTcF. One subject administered setmelanotide and 1 subject administered placebo in the 14-day 
infusion treatment group had a >30 ms change from baseline of the QTcB interval. One subject in the 
heterozygous treatment group administered setmelanotide had a QTcB interval >450  ms following 
setmelanotide administration. There was a single abnormal finding identified during cardiac telemetry: 
one subject administered setmelanotide had a non-sustained, asymptomatic, episode of ventricular 
tachycardia. This finding was reported as an adverse event of moderate intensity and considered 
unlikely to  be related to study medication. A subsequent cardiologist evaluation determined the brief 
arrhythmia was of no clinical significance and the subject was cleared for continued participation  in the 
study. 
In Study RM-493-009  there were again no clinically relevant mean changes in  QTcB or QTcF in either 
actively treated or placebo-treated subjects. Statistical  comparisons between the groups were not 
performed for this  study. 
Increases in QTcB from baseline of between 30 and 60  ms were recorded for 7 of 59 (11.9%)  of 
setmelanotide subjects compared to 5 of 40 (12.5%)  placebo subjects; the  equivalent proportions for 
QTcF were 3  of 59  (5.1%) for setmelanotide and 3 of 40 (7.5%)  for placebo. No subject, regardless of 
treatment, recorded an increase of >60  ms or an absolute value >500  ms for either QT correction. 
Skin Pigmentation 
In Study RM-493-001  quantitative  skin colour measurements were performed with  the Mexameter-18 
device. The amount of melanin in  the skin was measured on the cheek, on the forehead and on the 
buttock. 
Overall, small numerical trends on change from baseline to Day 3  were reported and approximately 
dose related. However, no significant  changes were seen for change from baseline to  Day 1 or Day 7. 
Overall, few if any of the changes reached statistical significance. 
Identical measurements were made in  Study RM-493-002.  Generally, the data suggest a trend towards 
an effect of setmelanotide on quantitative skin colour darkening, especially on the  cheek and forehead, 
and to a somewhat lesser degree on the  hip. Overall, clinical examination findings support conclusions 
based on Mexameter assessment. 
Quantitative skin colour assessment was again repeated in Study RM-493-003  and in  this study it 
showed a statistically  significant increase in pigmentation  for setmelanotide compared to placebo at all 
three sites.  
In addition, as part of the  same study protocol, patients had 3 representative pigmented skin lesions 
(prospectively identified by the site dermatologist prior to study start)  which were randomised to 
protocol-mandated biopsy at one of three times: before dosing, at the end of the 3-month  study, and 
approximately 90 days after the final dose of setmelanotide. The pathological diagnoses were 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/319064/2021 
Page 56/143 
 
 
 
performed by the  central clinical dermatopathologist. The majority of the lesions biopsied carried 
pathological diagnoses of nevi, lentigo  and seborrheic keratosis, as would be expected for these 
pigmented lesions. Of these biopsies, only 4 (from lesions in  3 patients [one patient had a non-protocol 
mandated biopsy taken at the same time as the protocol mandated biopsy]) showed any evidence of 
atypia, the first potential evidence of any dysplastic changes. All these lesions were nevi and all had 
low levels of atypia. Two of these patients’ biopsies were pre-dose (i.e., before any exposure to 
setmelanotide), and one was at the end of the 3-month  treatment period. 
Administration sites 
Administration site reactions were systematically assessed in studies RM-493-001  and RM-493-002.For 
each evaluation there were 5 possible reactions assessed (oedema, erythema, induration, itching,  pain 
or tenderness). 
In Study RM-493-001  injection site reactions were noted in both the  active and placebo groups, but all 
were mild (with  the  exception of 3 moderate reactions that  were all in the  placebo group). Most of the 
site reactions were mild erythema at the site of the indwelling  continuous infusion catheter. Many were 
transient, not  presenting consistently at  consecutive or most of the timepoints  for a given subject. 
None were considered clinically relevant. 
In Study RM-493-002  Infusion/injection site reactions were noted in both the  active and placebo 
groups, and the majority were mild  (3 moderate reactions: 2 pain or tenderness and 1 erythema). The 
majority of the reactions were mild erythema, and approximately a third of these erythema reactions 
were in  subjects administered placebo. The majority were transient,  and none were considered 
clinically relevant. 
Anti-drug Antibodies (ADA) 
Of the 48 patients  in Study RM-493-002  tested with  pre-dose and 2 post-dose timepoints  and of the  6 
patients tested with  pre-dose and 1 post-dose timepoint, none had a post-dose titre  that exceeded the 
pre-dose titre. Therefore, no samples were considered reactive, and no samples were positive for 
setmelanotide antibodies.  
Eighty-three patients  had samples collected in Study RM-493-009  for the presence of antibodies to 
setmelanotide. No samples were positive. 
Depression and Suicidal Ideation 
Subjects in Study RM-493-009  were assessed for depression and suicidal ideation using the Patient 
Health  Questionnaire-9 (PHQ9)  and Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) instruments, 
respectively. Generally, there were no significant  differences in the  overall depression /suicidality 
assessments scores measured during the study in those subjects receiving RM-493  versus placebo. No 
subject, regardless of treatment group, was identified by C-SSRS as having any suicidal ideation at any 
point in  the study. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Three different formulations have been used throughout  the clinical development: a non-preserved 
saline solution of setmelanotide for SC infusion and SC injection, a non-preserved mPEG-DSPE/CMC 
formulation and a preserved mPEG-DSPE formulation for SC injection.  The latter  (preserved mPEG-
DSPE) is the proposed commercial formulation. These formulations have been administered to  different 
populations (mostly healthy obese volunteers) in 13  studies investigating the clinical pharmacology of 
setmelanotide.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/319064/2021 
Page 57/143 
 
 
 
Concentrations of setmelatonide were measured in plasma and urine using  LC-MS/MS methods. To 
address the requirement for sample reanalysis as per EMA guidelines, the CHMP  recommended to 
provide data from sample analysis in pending clinical and validation (e.g. long-term stability) studies. 
Setmelanotide is characterized by a very low permeability and it  is in vitro not a substrate of P-gp and 
BCRP.  
After the SC injection of the to-be-marketed preserved mPEG-DSPE formulation, steady-state plasma 
concentrations of setmelanotide increased slowly, reaching maximum concentrations at a median tmax 
of 8.0h after dosing. In several clinical studies, patient  numbers were (very) low,  and, in addition, the 
conclusions were hampered due to aberrantly high or low concentrations, probably due to a limited 
compliance and consistency in  the outpatient  setting (see also section 2.5 Clinical efficacy). No IV 
formulation has been developed for use in humans, therefore the absolute bioavailability in  humans is 
unknown. However, a bioavailability of less than 100%  is expected as, following  subcutaneous 
administration, the  drug passes through  the lymphatic system, which  usually results in pre-systemic 
elimination.  
Given the uncertainties on the  rate and extent of absorption in function of the injection site and given 
that  that the  clinical studies for setmelanotide used the  injection in the abdomen only, the CHMP 
recommended to limit the  injection to the abdominal region. This has been reflected in section 4.2 of 
the SmPC. 
The results obtained with  transfected HEK cell lines showed that  it is neither a substrate of OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3 nor OCT2.  
Different results in the  protein binding were reported due to  the use of different methodologies. The 
ultrafiltration  method is often used at the  early discovery stage of the  program because it is a faster 
technique than the  equilibrium dialysis method but  is often seen as less reliable and suffers from non-
specific binding  of drug to  the apparatus. Equilibrium  dialysis is still  regarded as the reference 
technique to use in investigating the  binding characteristics of a new drug to serum. Therefore, the 
actual protein binding is set to 79.1%.  Given that  the lower percentages in protein binding estimated 
by ultrafiltration are considered to be more conservative since a higher free fraction of drug is present, 
the findings related to the studies on transporters were considered valid. 
The mean apparent volume of distribution  after SC administration of setmelanotide 3.0  mg QD is 
approximately 63 L, which  is consistent with  the value estimated from the  POPPK model, 48.7  L. 
The effective elimination t1/2  of setmelanotide (mPEG-DSPE formulation with  preservative) is 
approximately 11 hours. The CL/F  value is 4.86  L/h. In vitro experiments showed that setmelanotide is 
not a MATE1 substrate and a borderline MATE2K substrate. Setmelanotide is excreted in urine, with 
~39%  excreted unchanged.  
No in vivo Drug Drug Interaction (DDI) study with  a MATE2K inhibitor  was considered necessary. Mass-
balance studies are not  useful for determining the excretion pattern  of therapeutic proteins. 
Setmelanotide did  not appear to be metabolized by human hepatic microsomes and hepatocytes. 
Despite the  routes of elimination of setmelanotide in humans have not been explained in detail, it  can 
be expected that small proteins of Molecular Weight  (MW)<50000  Da (MW  of setmelanotide = 1117.3 
Da) are eliminated through renal filtration  followed by tubular re-absorption and subsequent metabolic 
catabolism. 
Based on the study 4006777,  only trace amounts of two  urine metabolites, M19  and M7 (found  in rat 
urines) were observed in a small number of subjects. 
Setmelanotide generally exhibited close to  dose proportionality across doses and studies. Accumulation 
of setmelanotide in  systemic circulation during QD dosing over 12  weeks was approximately 30% 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/319064/2021 
Page 58/143 
 
 
 
relative to the  first dose (after dose-normalization) which is consistent  with a half-life of 7 to 10 hours 
observed through the clinical development of setmelanotide. The catabolic effects of weight  loss have 
not impacted the PK.  
Based on the population PK model, the  inter-subject variability is estimated to be 28.7% and the 
intrasubject variability 27.6%  which is considered as moderate. It has been demonstrated in the 
exposure-response analyse that variability in treatment responses may not be due to PK covariates. 
Setmelanotide being well tolerated and being titrated to  effect, this  variability was considered 
acceptable.  
In the POPPK analyses, gender differences were observed.  Lower Ctrough levels in females were 
reported than  in males at all doses, the  CHMP however accepted that  such differences could be due to 
other factors such as body weight  and renal function.  Given that  the proposed posology is based on 
dose titration  to  the response, rather than  correlated with body weight, no dose adjustment in females 
was considered necessary. 
Additional data did not reveal any significant effects of race/ethnicity noting subjects were 
predominantly Caucasian (N=81)  or black (N=27)  in the clinical studies. 
Given the patient  populations for POMC and LEPR deficiency obesity are predominantly young, the  PK 
of setmelanotide in  the elderly have not been studied. 
No specific drug interaction studies in human subjects have been performed.  
In vitro studies showed that  setmelanotide has low potential for pharmacokinetic interactions related to 
cytochrome P450  (CYP), transporters and plasma protein binding. 
No specific patient pharmacodynamic studies were performed. Pharmacodynamic endpoints (e.g. the 
effect of setmelanotide on the degree of hunger experienced by the  patients, energy expenditure) were 
incorporated as secondary and tertiary endpoints in the pivotal efficacy and safety studies. No 
pharmacodynamics studies have been conducted in human subjects that are relevant to dose selection. 
The proposed regimen has been derived entirely from the efficacy and safety results of clinical trials. 
This was considered acceptable by the  CHMP given the ultra-rarity of the  condition and thus lack of 
available subjects. 
Pharmacodynamic effects of setmelanotide on blood pressure, heart rate, ECG, skin pigmentation, 
administration sites, anti-drug  antibodies, depression and suicidal ideation have been investigated. 
These data did not  reveal any trends or clinically meaningful changes. However, due to  the limited 
number of patients  included in the trials, these events (in  particular skin pigmentation,  hypertension) 
are further discussed in  the clinical safety section of this report (see section 2.6). In addition,  further 
updated data are expected to be available on the effect of setmelanotide on ADA and the CHMP 
recommended to submit them as post authorisation commitment (see further below and section 2.6.1 
Clinical Safety).  
No pharmacodynamics studies have been conducted in human subjects that  are relevant to dose 
selection. The proposed regimen has been derived entirely from the efficacy and safety results of 
clinical trials. 
Additional PK/PD analyses 
POPPK simulations were used to identify a relevant starting  dose for children from 6 years of age based 
on historical growth data over the desired age range. While the use of model-based approach was 
supported in principle, scarce data were available in the lower age/bodyweight ranges and no clinical 
data were available for validation. Initially, the applicant proposed an age-based flat dosing while the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/319064/2021

final population PK model shows a strong continuous correlation between weight  and PK parameters, 
resulting in higher exposure for lower weight and younger age. The appropriateness of the proposed 
fixed dose regimen, especially as patients  are supposed to  lose weight  during the treatment and the 
possible risk of children getting  overexposed by the fixed dose regimen was questioned. In addition, 
the lowest age in the model building dataset was 10 years old with only 4 patients  aged 10-12  years. 
Yet the model was used to extrapolate the dose for children down to  6 years old.  
To address these concerns, data from studies RM-493-012  and RM-493-015  were used to generate a 
plot of the titrated  dose (mg) associated with  effective weight-loss  versus age, which showed no 
correlation between effective dose and age. See Figure 2. 
Figure 3: Titrated dose (mg) as a function of age  (years) 
Another plot displaying effect in terms of change in bodyweight as a function of bodyweight-adjusted 
dose. Here it  is apparent that  5 children (<18 years) received higher weight-based doses than  given to 
adults. One child (<18y) experienced very high doses up to 0.056  mg/kg which is more than twice  the 
maximum dose of 0.022  mg/kg given to  adults and 3.7-fold higher than the maximum dose of the 
multiple ascending dose (MAD) study. The maximum single ascending dose (SAD) dose was 0.05 
mg/kg. It is also apparent that  4 adults and 2 children never achieved any weight loss. The applicant 
clarified that  the dose was chosen based on clinical response and tolerance. All 5 children who received 
higher weight-based doses than given to adults experienced adverse events (AEs) and 2 patients 
experienced serious AEs (SAEs). None of the three reported SAEs were considered related to the study 
treatment and resolved within  7 days. See Figure 3.

Figure 4: Weight  change  (kg) as a function of body weight adjusted  dose (mg/kg*100) 
Overall, the above data did not allow to  support a dosing regimen either based on age in the paediatric 
population. After further analyses of the quantitative  data, the added-value of bodyweight adjustment 
was also not  apparent based on efficacy based titration.  See Figure  4 and Figure 5.

To improve the POPPK model, the  CHMP recommended to re-fit the population data to  a 2-
compartment model since: 
- Concentration-time profiles in studies 001, 002  and 008  indicated setmelanotide exhibits two-
compartmental pharmacokinetics; 
- In saline formulation, the  second compartment with  a slower elimination is apparent about 8  hours 
post-dose and delayed to  24 hours post-dose when given in the commercial DSPE formulation. 
-  Patient PK is not well described beyond 24  hours post dose; and 
-  Population PK of setmelanotide was described by a 1-compartment model.   
However, it  was clarified by the applicant that  this approach was not feasible. The saline formulation, 
both infusion and subcutaneous bolus administration, was the original formulation used to assess the 
potential for RM-493  as a drug. The saline data showed that  setmelanotide exhibits 2-compartment 
disposition kinetics. However, these data were not  included in the POPPK model. The POPPK model was 
also based on data with the  intended commercial formulation in  which Tmax is delayed to 6-8  hours 
and the 2nd elimination delayed to 24 hours post-dose. Setmelanotide was given once daily. No 
samples were taken beyond 24  hours post-dose. 
Upon CHMP  request, additional simulations  were also conducted for paediatric patients  and exposures 
for the different doses proposed be compared to the  target adult reference range, accounting for age 
related weight  for obesity and available EMA guidance (Modelling and Simulation Working Party Q&A) 
on modelling and simulation for the  paediatric population. However, the original Pop-PK mode was 
used since no model improvement could be made, as explained above. Based on these additional 
analyses, exposure matching between adults and children was not  achieved neither for Cmax nor for 
AUC: the levels simulated were lower for the lowest dose groups and higher for the upper dose groups. 
See Figure 6 and Figure 7. 
Assessment report

In the absence of an adequate PK/PD model, the actual impact of the observed discrepancy is 
unknown. It could thus  not be claimed that  the age-based dosing recommendation is informed by 
exposure matching using the POPPK model.

Given the limitations  and given the  fact that the  data do not  support any model improvement, the 
presented POPPK modelling could not be followed. Dosing regimen only based on modelling and 
simulations is thus  not considered appropriate.  
Overall, the POPPK modelling is considered not appropriate for extrapolation towards the youngest 
children and the dosing recommendation. A proposed dosing scheme based on up-titration  to effect 
and acceptable tolerance is thus  recommended based on clinical observations in trials. This is further 
discussed in section 2.5.3. 
Only preliminary data are available in renal impairment patients (ongoing study  RM-493-029).  These 
data indicate that  setmelanotide showed nearly 2-fold increased half-life and around 20%  decreased 
clearance for mild as well as nearly 30%  decrease in clearance for moderate renal impairment. Based 
on these findings, the applicant suggested a reduction in initial starting  dose by 2-fold for the 
moderate renal impairment group would be a conservative approach. However, the CHMP considered 
that  the use of setmelanotide is not to be recommended in this population until  the final results of 
study RM-493-029  are reported. This has been reflected in section 4.2  of the  SmPC.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/319064/2021 
Page 64/143 
 
 
 
 
In subjects with  mild renal impairment, the applicant proposed to initiate  dosing with  a dose of 0.5  mg 
versus the 1.0-mg  starting dose given to subjects with  normal renal function and thereafter dose 
escalation as indicated for subjects with  normal renal function,  taking into account both the 
achievement of desired weight loss and safety/tolerability as doses are titrated  upwards. This was 
considered acceptable. In adults, the maximum daily dose remains 3mg. However, in children aged 6-
12 years, the maximum daily dose is to be reduced from 2.5mg down to  2mg. This has been reflected 
in section 4.2 of the SmPC and is to be reviewed when final results of study RM-493-029  are reported. 
Immunogenicity assay 
A tiered strategy for analysis and reporting of samples for ADA to setmelanotide was utilized  and 
applied to studies RM-493-011,  -012,  -014,  -015, -022,  and -026. A similar strategy using an original 
version of the setmelanotide ADA assay was applied to the earlier studies (RM-493-001  through -010), 
although the  revalidated assay is considered to be more robust and was used for the pivotal studies, 
RM-493-012  and RM-493-015.  The original assay, using a qualitative enzyme linked immunosorbent 
assay (ELISA) technique has been refined on several occasions, first to compensate for the functional 
affinity loss in the PC antibodies and to meet the updated ADA Guidelines, and second to improve the 
sensitivity of the assay for the three tested populations: normal adult, obese adult  and paediatric 
obese subjects.  
Samples with  signals above the screening cut point  or post-dose sample that  was less than the 
screening cut-point  but  at least 2-fold higher than the treatment-naïve screening sample were 
considered positive and were tested in the confirmatory assay. Antibody (Ab) titer was determined in 
confirmed positive. Furthermore, confirmed positive samples were tested to determine neutralising (N) 
Ab using a cell-based assay. All subject samples tested in  the setmelanotide ADA assay were also 
tested in a validated anti-α-MSH  antibody assay using the  same format than the setmelanotide ADA 
assay. To mitigate the risk of false positive results, i.e. the confirmatory results should be based on 3 
independent analysis of each samples. A sample should be considered positive only if 2 of 3 are found 
positive in the confirmatory assay. However, a high intra-assay variability has been observed for the % 
inhibition  results of study  samples. Moreover, the impact of the presence of the drug in  the patient 
sample is unknown for the confirmatory ADA assay. Some uncertainties regarding a potential  prozone 
effect are also remaining. Therefore, the suitability of the confirmatory ADA assay to exclude potential 
false-positive results obtained from the ADA screening assay sample is to be confirmed. For this 
reason, the CHMP  recommended the inclusion in section 4.8 of the SmPC of only the results of 
screened anti-setmelanotide ADA positive patients  instead of the  presentation of the confirmatory 
results for setmelanotide ADA screened positive patients. 
Currently, only subjects showing an increase in the signal in the screening ADA assay after drug 
treatment relative to  the pre-treatment sample were considered as potentially positive in screening. 
But the post-treatment  samples in the anti-setmelanotide  ADA assay that are above the screening cut 
point and below the screening result of their respective pre-treatment-naïve sample should also be 
considered positive and be further tested in the confirmatory assay. This analysis is still  pending and is 
recommended to be submitted  as a post-authorization  commitment. The same strategy is applied for 
the analysis of screening sample results in  the anti-α-MSH  antibody assay. 
Overall, further data are expected on the effect of setmelanotide on ADA and the CHMP  recommended 
to submit  an update including  the results of all immunogenicity samples collected in pivotal clinical 
studies RM-493-012  and RM-493-015,  once available. At the same time, an updated integrated 
analysis of the clinical significance of immunogenicity of setmelanotide is expected. Due to the transfer 
of the immunogenicity assays to a new CRO, the CHMP  also recommended to provide revalidation data 
as well as in-study  performance data, including the  applied assay cut points,  to demonstrate that all 
Assessment report

immunogenicity assays used are suitable for their intended purpose. The final bioanalytical reports are 
also expected in this submission. 
A number of approaches have been tested for the detection of antibodies to mPEG-DPSE in human 
serum. But  all attempts to provide a sensitive assay to detect anti mPEG-DSPE antibodies failed. As 
mPEG-DPSE is an excipient, it  is not expected that  anti-mPEG-DSPE antibodies would impact the 
efficacy of setmelanotide. Furthermore, no safety concerns that  may be related to  antibodies to 
setmelanotide or to mPEG-DSPE have been observed by the applicant up to  now. Therefore, the 
strategy of not  planning any further development work on an assay to detect anti-mPEG-DSPE 
antibodies in clinical samples is considered acceptable by the CHMP at  the present time, noting 
development of anti-mPEG-DSPE antibodies may need further consideration in the  future,  in case of 
hypersensitivity reactions are reported later on. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the pharmacological profile of setmelanotide in human studies has been adequately 
documented and meet the requirements to support this application. 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs  to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP  recommends the following points for investigation: 
- To provide data from sample analysis in pending clinical and validation (e.g. long-term stability) 
studies as per EMA guidelines; 
- To improve the reliability of the  setmelanotide confirmatory ADA assay for the detection of the ADA in 
the patient  samples in presence of clinically relevant drug levels; 
- To provide updated integrated analysis of the clinical significance of immunogenicity of setmelanotide 
as data become available. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The clinical development program comprises the following clinical studies: 
- a phase III, one year, multicentre, global, open label, non-randomised study (RM-493-012) 
including a 2-12  week initial  dose titration  and a double-blind placebo controlled 8-week withdrawal 
period in  which patients would randomly be administered placebo for a duration of four week to assess 
efficacy of setmelanotide in POMC deficiency obesity. 
- a phase III, one year, multicentre, global, open label, non-randomised study (RM-493-015) 
including a 2-12  week initial  dose titration  and a double-blind placebo controlled 8-week withdrawal 
period in  which patients would randomly be administered placebo for a duration of four week to assess 
efficacy of setmelanotide in LEPR deficiency obesity. 
- a phase II, investigator-led, ongoing, 12  week, open-label, uncontrolled, setmelanotide treatment 
study (RM-493-011)  with  an additional one-year extension in patients  with  POM homozygous, 
heterozygous, epigenetic deficiency, LEPR deficiency to assess long term efficacy and safety. 
- a phase III ongoing extension study (RM-493-022)  in all patients who  have completed a trial of 
Setmelanotide for the treatment of obesity associated with  genetic defects upstream of the  MC4 
receptor in the leptin-melanocortin  pathway (including  but  not limited to the  patients enrolled in the 
RM-493-012  and -015  pivotal studies in POMC/PCSK1/LEPR deficiency obesity) to assess long term 
safety.

2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
No dose response studies were conducted and the choice of the dosing regimens in the  pivotal trials 
RM-493-012  and RM-493-011  was based on clinical findings  from the investigator-led RM-493-011 
study, as well as the  RM-493-002  Phase 1b multiple  ascending dose study in  healthy obese subjects. 
2.5.2.  Main study(ies) 
As both pivotal studies RM-493-012  and RM-493-015  had a near identical setup and protocol, all 
modalities other than results will be presented for both studies under common sections in this  report. 
The only difference is that  both studies differ in the genetic deficiency causing a similar outcome, lack 
of endogenous alpha-MSH signal peptide release at POMC-neuron axons, with  the former recruiting 
POMC/PCSK1 deficiency obesity patients (RM-493-012)  and the latter LERP-deficiency obesity patients 
(RM-493-015). 
Studies RM-493-012 and RM-493-015 
Both pivotal phase III studires were one year, multicentre,  global, open label, non-randomised study  
(RM-493-012)  including  a 2-12 week initial  dose titration  and a double-blind placebo controlled 8-
week withdrawal  period in which  patients would randomly be administered placebo for a duration of

Study Participants 
Both studies consisted of the following main criteria (non-exhaustive list, most pertinent listed): 
Inclusion 
•  Bi-allelic, homozygous or compound heterozygous (a different gene mutation  on each allele) 
genetic status for either the POMC, PCSK1 or LEPR genes, with  the loss-of-function (LOF) 
variant for each allele conferring a severe obesity phenotype.  
•  Age 6 years and above.  
• 
• 
If adult age ≥18  years, obesity with  BMI ≥30 kg/m2; if child or adolescent, obesity with  BMI 
≥95th  percentile for age on growth  chart assessment. 
Female participants of child-bearing potential  or male participants with  female partners of 
child-bearing potential had to agree to the  use contraception as outlined in the protocol. 
Exclusion 
•  Recent intensive (within  2  months) diet and/or exercise regimen with or without  the use of 
weight  loss agents including herbal medications, that had resulted in weight loss or weight 
stabilization,  though patients could be considered if they had ended such a regimen at least 1 
month ago 
• 
Prior gastric bypass surgery resulting in >10%  weight loss durably maintained from the 
baseline pre-operative weight with  no evidence of weight regain 
•  Diagnosis of a DSM-III disorder that  might interfere with  study compliance, suicidal ideation or 
recent suicide attempts 
•  History of significant liver disease or liver injury or current liver assessment for an etiology 
other than non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) 
•  History or presence of impaired renal function 
•  History or close family history (parents or siblings)  of skin cancer or melanoma, or patient 
history of ocular-cutaneous albinism  
•  Significant dermatologic findings  relating to melanoma or pre-melanoma skin lesions, 
determined as part of a screening comprehensive skin evaluation performed by a qualified 
dermatologist 
Treatments 
A dose titration  phase in the  pivotal trials was to determine a patient’s so-called Therapeutic Dosing 
(TD). The TD was defined as a weight-loss over two weeks of 2-3  kg for and adult patient and 1-2  kg 
for paediatric patients combined with  a decrease of hunger score to  a range of 0-2,  was achieved. 
Once TD was achieved the subject was expected to continue on this dose throughout the  duration of 
the trials, and this  TD would also be carried over in  the extension study if the patient  decided to  enrol. 
The final dose titration  schedule during the  up-titration  phase of the pivotal trials is shown in Table 4.

During the dose titration,  increments of 0.5 mg dose increases were done at weekly intervals to 
determine an individual’s therapeutic dose, up to the approved maximum dose in the specific country 
of the participating site. 
Thereafter, patients continued  active treatment at their  specific optimal therapeutic dose for an 
additional 10 weeks, for a total combined dosing duration of 12 weeks at the individual patient’s 
therapeutic dose.  
The two-week titration schedule in which a patient’s therapeutic dose is reached was counted as part 
of the treatment phase, allowing patients to have an effective 12  weeks (2 + 10 open-label) of 
treatment before entering the double-blind withdrawal  period. Following  the dose titration  and 10-week 
open label active treatment phases, only patients who lost  at least 5 kg (or 5% if baseline <  100 kg) of 
weight  from baseline, and who continued  to show tolerability to setmelanotide, continued in the 
remainder of the study. Patients who do not exhibit the  required weight loss of at least 5 kg (5%  if < 
100 kg at baseline) were taken off active treatment. The onset of the  placebo period was variable for 
each patient  in order to mask the actual timing of the withdrawal  period; patients,  investigators, and 
investigation sites remained blinded as to when placebo treatment was administered.  
During the 8-week withdrawal  period, patients  were administered placebo for 4 weeks with  different 
timing.  Given that  the elimination half-life is 11 hours and that the majority of the drug is eliminated 
after 55 hours, a carryover effect is considered minimal due to  the 4-week withdrawal  period. As such 
any weight  gains seen during this  latter period can be considered attributable to the  withdrawal of 
setmelanotide. 
Following  the withdrawal period, patients went  on to  complete approximately 1 year of treatment at 
the therapeutic dose (the primary endpoint defined as 52-weeks after achieving their relative 
therapeutic dose). It was anticipated  that the  patient’s therapeutic dose, established during the period 
of dose titration,  would be administered throughout  the study. 
The study drug was provided as a sterile solution  for injection with  a nominal concentration of 10 
mg/ml. In study RM-394-012  all but  one batch  of investigational product and one batch of placebo 
used a preservative free formulation, whereas the latter two  batches as well as all batches used in RM-
394-015  were of the preservative containing formulation. As no significant  PK differences were 
apparent between both  batches this  likely did not have an influence on the efficacy or safety results. 
Concomitant drugs were allowed provided they did not pose a safety risk, could significantly impact the 
efficacy assessments or could have and anorectic effect (whether intended or as unintended non-rare 
side effect).

Objectives 
The primary objective of both studies was to demonstrate statistical  and clinically meaningful effects of 
the treatment on percent body weight  change after 1 year of treatment. The null hypothesis for this 
objective was that  the proportion of patients  achieving at least 10% of weight loss after one year 
would be at most 5%, based on a historical control value, versus the  hypothesis that  this proportion 
will be at least 5%. 
The secondary objectives included the safety and tolerability of treatment,  the hunger score for 
patients 12  years and older, percent change in body fat mass, glucose parameters, waist 
circumference and reversal of hunger and weight  during the double-blind withdrawal period. 
Tertiary objectives included percent change in total  body mass, non-bone lean mass, and bone density, 
fasting lipid states,  PK of the investigative product, C-reactive protein, dose response throughout 
titration,  QoL and health status changes. 
Hunger and neurocognition changes in patients  aged 6 to  11 years of age and change in pubertal 
development were seen as exploratory objectives. Other exploratory objectives included bone age 
assessed change in growth  and development and ABPM, skin pigmentation measured by 
spectrophotometer, energy expenditure, and 24-hour pharmacokinetic profile for patients participating 
in these sub-studies. Further  areas of exploration were hormonal, neuroendocrine, metabolic and anti-
inflammatory analytes and biomarker assays, a PK/PD response employing a suitable endocrine 
biomarker predictive of setmelanotide target engagement, agonism and efficacy through activation of 
the MC4R and (if feasible) correlations of bi-allelic or loss-of-function POMC and PCSK1 genetic 
mutations  and POMC deficiency due to diverse allelic variants with  the magnitude of setmelanotide 
efficacy endpoints. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary protocol-defined endpoint was the proportion of patients in the full  analysis set (FAS) who 
met the ≥10%  weight loss threshold (responders) after approximately 1 year of treatment, compared 
to the proportion from historical data (at  most, 5% responders in the null population). 
The key secondary endpoints were: 
•  Mean percent change in body weight from baseline in the Designated User Set (DUS) 
population, whereby the  second success criterion for the  study is defined as a 10%  observed 
mean weight  loss from baseline to  1 year of treatment  in this population. 
•  Mean percent change in weekly average of daily hunger score (most hunger over the last 24-
hours) from baseline in patients ≥12  years of age in  the DUS population. 
•  Met  responder threshold of ≥25%  improvement from baseline in hunger threshold 
(responders) in the FAS population. The relevance of this  threshold was not  clearly justified. 
Other (non-key) secondary, tertiary and exploratory endpoints related to  efficacy mainly included: 
•  Hunger was assessed daily throughout  the study; patients  ≥12 years of age self-report their 
hunger by responding to three questions and patients 6 to 11  years of age self-report their 
hunger each morning just prior to dosing by responding to one question 
• 
Two global hunger questions were administered to  assess patients’ perceptions of their current 
status and change from baseline at key timepoints 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/319064/2021 
Page 70/143 
 
 
 
•  Body composition was assessed including total body weight loss, fat loss, and non-bone lean 
mass, measured in kg as well as percent change from baseline at the  end of 1 year of 
treatment 
•  Glucose parameters as measured by fasting glucose, HbA1c and OGTT with  a focus on 
parameters of insulin  sensitivity over time were assessed 
•  Waist circumference was measured according to US National Heart Lung  and Blood Institute 
criteria over the  course of the study. 
• 
• 
To further assess improvements in weight and hunger related to treatment  with  setmelanotide 
in this  ultra-rare patient population,  a placebo withdrawal period was implemented to allow 
each patient  to serve as their own  control. 
Lipids (fasting  cholesterol and triglycerides) were assessed during treatment with 
setmelanotide throughout the  study. 
•  Changes in  pubertal development for patients who  had yet to reach Tanner Stage V was 
evaluated over the course of the study 
•  Changes in  growth and development in patients <18  years of age were assessed with regular 
height,  weight and body mass index (BMI) determinations (including  Z score calculations) and 
annual bone maturation evaluations were performed during the study,  as available 
• 
Limited number of patients were expected to participate in various sub-studies (ABPM, skin 
color quantification,  energy expenditure, and 24-hour PK profile); therefore, it was anticipated 
that  no definitive conclusions would be determined regarding the effects of setmelanotide on 
these parameters. However, trends over time were explored 
Sample size 
A minimum of 10 patients per study was foreseen as it was expected that  treatment with 
setmelanotide for 1 year would be associated with  a TRUE underlying probability of at least 10% 
weight  loss at 1 year of at least 50%. That  assumption yielded at least 94% power to yield a 
statistically significant  (alpha=0.05 and 0.025  1-sided, due to  discreteness of the  binomial distribution) 
difference from the  null hypothesis 5% value for 10 subjects. If the true probability of at least 10% 
weight  loss at 1 year was 40%, then  power was ~83%.  The minimum  observed proportion of N=10 
patients with  at least 10% weight  loss at 1 year that would  have yielded statistical  significance 
(alpha=0.05  and 0.025  1-sided, due to discreteness of the binomial distribution)  was 0.3 (3 of 10). 
Randomisation 
No randomisation was employed in these studies and all patients were assigned to active treatment 
except during the  double-blind withdrawal phase. 
Blinding (masking) 
Both studies were open-label, except for the 8-week double-blind,  placebo-controlled variably timed 
withdrawal period.  
All patients and study-related staff remained blinded to study drug and patient assignation. The 
Investigator, study  site staff, clinical research organization staff providing site management and CRO

Medical Monitor did  not have access to the actual treatment  sequence being administered during the 8-
week double-blind placebo-controlled phase, except in the  case of an emergency. 
Statistical methods 
Five study populations were defined: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The FAS (Full Analysis Set) population  was defined as all patients  who received any study drug 
and had at least one baseline assessment (including those who did and did not demonstrate ≥5 
kg weight loss or 5%  of body weight [if weight  was <100 kg at baseline] over 12-week open 
label treatment period and proceeded into the double blind, placebo-controlled withdrawal 
period). 
The FAS was the population  used for the primary endpoint analysis. 
The DUS (Designated Use Set) population  was defined as all patients  who received any study 
drug, demonstrated ≥5 kg weight  loss or 5% of body weight (if baseline weight  was <100 kg) 
over 12-week open-label treatment period, and proceeded into the double-blind, placebo-
controlled withdrawal period. 
The Completers’ Set (CS) population  was defined as all patients  in the DUS population who 
demonstrated both ≥5 kg weight loss or 5% of body weight (if  baseline weight was <100  kg) 
over 12-week open-label treatment period and continued  in the study on active treatment  to 
complete a full year (approximately) of treatment. 
The Per-Protocol (PP) population was defined as the  subset of patients  in the FAS population 
with  no major protocol violations and was exploratory in nature. 
The SAS (Safety Analysis Set) population was defined as all patients who received any study 
drug injections at least one post-dose safety assessment. This population  may be identical to 
the FAS and is the primary safety and PK analysis population. 
The main analyses were planned to  be done on the ‘Pivotal Set’, defined as the first patients to  enrol in 
and complete each trial (expected to encompass ~10  patients at minimum), while  all patients whom 
enrolment from the pivotal set onward were designated the ‘Supplemental Set’. The 1-year 
assessment of the former would be done separately and pooled with  any data available from the latter 
whereby data from supplemental patients  with less than 1 year of data available would be imputed 
using a linear model. Once all supplemental patients  have reached 1 year of data availability the same 
analyses will be re-ran with  the true 1-year data points.    
General Methods 
Baseline data were those last measurements obtained before administration of the first dose of 
investigative product, with the  exception of hunger scoring for which the data collected on Day 1 of 
treatment could be considered as baseline if the average weekly hunger score was not collected prior 
to treatment start. 
Primary analysis was on the impact at the end one year of treatment.  Additional analyses will be 
performed on the specific treatment intervals separately (screening, titration,  initial  12-open label 
treatment period, the 8-week double blind period and the 32-week open label treatment period) and 
were not  part of the  present application (pending).  
Supplemental exploratory analyses are to be examined for data collected during the screening period, 
as well as the dose titration  period as to explore the baseline variability of POMC deficiency subjects as 
well as the therapeutic dose response during titration.  Hunger and weight  variability/stability or

loss/gain, as well as patient medical history will be examined from before study entry, during the 4 
weeks of screening and the 2-12  weeks of titration.  These analyses were not part of the present 
application (pending). 
Co-variates and multiplicity 
As there was only a single primary efficacy analysis multiplicity  was not considered and given the  likely 
underpowered nature of any withdrawal period analysis (thus  making them supportive/descriptive 
only) adjustment for multiplicity  was not necessary. For secondary endpoint onward multiplicity  could 
be a concern but would be difficult  to address multiplicity  by rigorous statistical  approaches given the 
extremely limited number patients in the studied population. 
Therefore nominal-p-values were to be used to interpret each endpoint  separately, despite the fact 
that  this may increase probability of Type I errors occurring for the  endpoints considered. An attempt 
to alleviate this  issue was made by using a step-down approach if statistical  significance is achieved in 
the primary endpoint: 
The first key secondary endpoint is change from baseline in body weight  at approximately 
1-year in the  DUS population. 
↓ 
The second key secondary endpoint is change from baseline in weekly “most hunger in 
the last 24  hours” hunger scores over approximately 1-year of treatment in the DUS 
population. 
↓ 
The third key secondary endpoint is the categorical percent of responders’ analysis of 
hunger (using the 25%  improvement in hunger threshold) in the FAS population at 
approximately 1-year.  
Missing data 
If data for primary of key secondary endpoints was missing imputation  with  a linear model would be 
used, unless sufficient  data points  weren’t available in which case the longitudinal  mixed model for 
analysis was employed, if the cause of missing data was not related to  the treatment itself. If 
treatment-related a 1-year weight change of 0  kg will  be imputed.  Supplemental patients  with less 
than 3 months  of data available will  not be considered in the combined cohort analyses. 
Primary endpoint evaluation 
The primary endpoint was analysed via the exact binomial test which will  test whether the percentage 
of patients who reach at  least 10%  weight loss is greater than 5%.  One-sided, 95% CIs were 
calculated using the exact Clopper-Pearson method. 
If statistical significance is achieved, the proportion of patients  in the FAS population who show ≥10% 
weight  loss at approximately 1 year will be numerically compared (point  estimate) to the 35% 
proportion of responders according to  success criteria and no formal statistical  analysis will be 
performed.  
At the time of the final analysis (pending),  a linear mixed model repeated measures analysis of 
variance with a fixed term for time and baseline weight  and a random effect for subjects will  be used 
to assess the primary efficacy endpoint at approximately 1-year. All weight  measurements obtained 
during the study will  be included in  the model. An unstructured covariance matrix will  be used to model 
the expected different variances among the participants.  In the  event the mixed model does not 
converge with an unstructured  covariance matrix a compound-symmetric then  Toeplitz covariance

matrix will be employed instead. Additionally, a paired t-test will  be derived from the model and 
compared to no change (0% mean percent weight change from baseline) and will use Satterthwaite's 
degrees of freedom estimates (1-sided, compared to alpha of 0.05 for the primary success of this 
endpoint; a comparison to an alpha of 0.025 will  also be provided).  
The assumption of normality will  be assessed via a visual diagnostic of closeness to normality, not as a 
conditional test  associated with efficacy endpoint  analyses. Graphical assessments of residuals from 
the model fit may be examined. If a substantial departure from normality is observed, a 
transformation such as log (post/pre) or rank or other non-parametric test may be used to analyse the 
data as a sensitivity analysis; however, the  analysis on the original scale of observation will be 
reported.  
Key Secondary endpoint evaluation 
Analyses of the  key secondary endpoints will  be supported by way of running the  pre-specified key 
secondary analyses in the  DUS, FAS and CS populations,  and hunger specifically by additional morning 
hunger and average hunger assessments. 
Once the  linear mixed model repeated measures analysis of variance of the primary endpoint  is 
concluded and found to  be statistically  significant, the mean percent change from baseline at the end 
of 1-year of treatment in the DUS population will be numerically compared (point  estimate) to the 
≥10%  mean change from baseline in body weight;  no formal statistical analysis will be performed.  
The secondary endpoint also be performed in the FAS population, as a sensitivity analysis, using a 
non-parametric 1-sample Wilcoxon signed rank approach, which should mitigate the  issues raised by 
the occurrence of a bimodal distribution. 
The second key secondary endpoint, the mean percent change from baseline in  weekly average hunger 
in the DUS population, was to be analysed in a similar manner using a linear mixed model for repeated 
measures analysis of covariance with weekly average hunger percent change from baseline as the 
outcome and fixed terms for time and baseline hunger and a random effect for subject. “Hunger in  the 
morning” and “average hunger over a 24-hour period” will be analysed in the same manner as 
additional secondary endpoints.  
If the above analysis proves to be statistically significant the mean percent change in hunger from 
baseline at the  end of approximately 1-year of treatment in the DUS population will  be numerically 
compared (point estimate) to  a 25%  mean change from baseline in  hunger. The choice of a 25% 
reduction in hunger score was based on patient reported outcome measures and bodyweight. Based on 
these data the appropriate threshold for a relevant change in hunger score is 13.9% and 15.4%  (for 
the PROMs) and 27% for bodyweight. 
Similar as for the first key secondary endpoint, sensitivity analysis will be provided by performing the 
same analysis in  the FAS. 
The third key secondary endpoint is the proportion of patients  in the FAS population who achieve at 
least a 25% hunger improvement from baseline threshold compared to the null hypothesis that  5% of 
patients will  achieve this threshold at the end of approximately 1-year of treatment.  This will be 
analysed via the  exact binomial test which  will test whether the percentage of patients  who reach at 
least 25% hunger improvement is greater than  5%.  
Once the  third key secondary analysis is complete, and if it  reaches statistical significance, the 
proportion of patients  in the FAS population who show ≥25%  hunger improvement will be numerically 
compared (point estimate) to  the 35% proportion of responders at the  end of approximately 1-year of 
treatment.

Results 
Both pivotal studies were submitted  as individual clinical study report (data cut-off: 09 July 2019),  with 
completed pivotal cohorts. In addition, individual addenda were provided with  an updated data cut-off 
(30 April 2020),  including ongoing supplemental cohorts. The presented results account for the 
completed pivotal and ongoing supplement cohorts. 
Study RM-493-012 (POMC deficiency) 
Participant flow 
As of 30  April 2020,  a total of 15 patients have been enrolled in the  study; 10 pivotal patients (9 POMC 
and 1 PCSK1 deficiency patients)  and 5  supplemental patients  (all with  POMC deficiency). Of the  10 
former patients, 9  have completed the foreseen 1-year treatment  period and 1 patient discontinued 
treatment due to lack of efficacy. Of the 5 supplemental patients,  2 have finished the protocol-defined 
1 year of treatment, 2 still  have treatment ongoing and 1 discontinued the study  due to  a protocol 
violation as it  was discovered that the patient did not have a biallelic mutation. Consequently, the 
clinical database is still  open and will only be locked once all participants have completed the 1-year 
treatment. 
Recruitment 
Patients recruitment started on 14 February 2017.   
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol was amended 13 times, mainly to accommodate regional regulations of specific 
individual participating countries. 
For example, specific inclusion criteria were implemented including age inclusion criteria of 9 years 
instead of 6 years and specific BMI criteria, in addition  to other country-specific protocol changes in 
some countries. However, these amendments did not exclude any patients of being recruited. Likewise, 
the change in dose for patients aged 9-11 years had no impact, as no patients  were included within 
this age-range in  the concerned country.  
A maximal dose limit  of 2.5 mg was initially imposed by some regulatory authorities  in their respective 
national centres, since at the  time when the concerned test sites were inducted, there was no clinical 
experience with a dosing >2.5 mg/kg. Other sites remained at a potential maximal dose of 3.0 
mg/kg/. A protocol amendment was later accepted to allow this higher top dose, based on clinical 
experience. 
The applicant changed the  primary endpoint from a mean change analysis to a proportional responder 
endpoint, while  the pivotal trials were already ongoing.   
The above changes are further discussed in  section 2.5.3  of this report.

Numbers analysed 
As of 9 July 2019,  the different sets of efficacy evaluation are presented in Figure  9. As of 30 April 
2020,  4 supplemental patients had either finished 1  year of treatment or were ongoing. The FAS and 
DUS at the time of this report included these 4  supplemental subjects, however as two of them were 
still  undergoing treatment,  their 52-week data was imputed. No  supplemental patients  were included in 
the second or third  key secondary endpoint analyses.

Primary Endpoint 
A total of 8 of the 10 pivotal subjects and 4 of the  supplemental subjects (2 of which did not  yet reach 
52 weeks of treatment and for whom data were thus  imputed) reached the primary endpoint with  a p-
value of less than  0.0001.  For the pivotal cohort the results were replicated in  the DUS and CS 
population where 8 of 9 patients (88.9%)  reached the primary endpoint. See Table 7.

Key Secondary Endpoints 
The key secondary endpoint was evaluated in  the DUS population,  which showed a mean negative 
weight  change from baseline to Week 52 of +/-  26%. An overall continuous pattern of weight loss 
during treatment was seen, with overall clear weight  regain during the  blinded withdrawal period. A 
total of 92.3  percent of the overall DUS population (pivotal + evaluable supplemental patients) 
achieved a minimum of 10%  weight loss from baseline to Week 52, whereas the pivotal patient cohort 
in isolation managed an 89%  success rate in  this regard. The Week 52 data for two supplemental 
patients was imputed as they did not yet complete one year of treatment.  
Results (including patients  from the supplemental cohort) are provided in  Figure 10 and Table 8: 
Time point at week 0 is indicated with a dashed line and defined as when a participant received their first therapeutic 
dose of setmelanotide. Withdrawal period consists of 4 weeks of active drug and then 4 weeks of placebo. One patient 
received treatment  in reverse  order  during  the withdrawal  period; patient  received placebo  between weeks  12  and 
16 and setmelanotide thereafter. Data are graphed  by the planned timing of each visit.

The second key secondary was the  mean percent change in hunger from baseline to the Week 52  of 
treatment, as measured by the  worst ‘most hunger’ in 24 hours. This endpoint was evaluated in the 
DUS cohort subjects that  were 12 years or older, due to the incompatibility  of the hunger assessment 
tools with  younger aged subjects. Overall these patients managed to  achieve a mean decrease in 
appetite of 27%, however, only 3 of the 8 evaluable subjects (43%) managed to  achieve a decrease in 
hunger score of 25% or more. See Table 9.

The third key secondary endpoint evaluated the proportion of patients ≥12  years achieving at least 
25% improvement in hunger scores following 1 year of treatment  with setmelanotide in the FAS 
population. Half  of the pivotal FAS cohort managed to reach this endpoint [n=4  (50%),  90%CI:19.29- 
80.71,  p=0.004].  No data on supplemental cohort patients  was available as only one supplemental 
subject was >12 years and the patient did not  have baseline hunger assessment available. 
Results from other secondary/tertiary/exploratory endpoints (cut-off date: 09 July 2019) can be 
summarised below:  
•  At Week 52,  patients in the pivotal DUS population had a mean negative change in waistline 
circumference of 15%. 
•  Overall a mean weight  gain of 5.5  kilograms was noted when  pivotal cohort patients  underwent 
the 4-week setmelanotide withdrawal  during the 8-week blinded withdrawal  period. 
•  During the 4-week setmelanotide withdrawal period the pivotal cohort DUS subjects saw a 
mean increase in worst  hunger score in  24 hours of 2.2  units increase, though  this change was 
not statistically  significant. 
•  Of the overall weight loss, a mean of 74% was due to loss of body fat, with  no appreciable loss 
of bone density or non-bone lean body mass. 
• 
The mean BMI in the pivotal DUS patients changed -27.82%  from Baseline to week 52. 
•  Observed energy expenditures showed net  reductions at the  relevant assessment points, 
consistent with  the weight  loss achieved. 
Study RM-493-015 (LEPR Deficiency) 
Participant flow 
As of the of 30 April 2020  a total  of 12 patients have been enrolled in the  study; 11 pivotal patients 
and 4 supplemental patients of which 3 patients  had not  yet finished 1  year of treatment and 1 of 
which was <12  years of age. The latter paediatric patient was not  included in  the second or third key 
secondary endpoint analyses as they were below the age thresholds for these analyses. 
Of the 11 former patients  10 have completed the foreseen 1-year treatment period and 1 subject 
discontinued due to an AE (said patient’s W52 data was thus imputed  using a linear model). Of the 4 
supplemental patients, 1 had finished the protocol-defined 1 year of treatment  and 3  were still under 
treatment. Consequently, the clinical database is still  open and will  only be locked once all participants 
have completed the 1-year treatment. 
Recruitment 
Patients recruitment started on 8 January 2018. 
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol was amended five times, mainly to accommodate regional regulations of specific 
individual participating countries. Specifically, protocol amendment related to the inclusion of two 
global hunger questions did not affect the key secondary endpoint as collection of responses was 
achieved by using  a different questionnaire. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/319064/2021 
Page 82/143 
 
 
 
A maximal dose limit  of 2.5 mg was initially imposed by some regulatory authorities  in their respective 
national centres, due to  the fact that  at the time when the concerned test sites were inducted, there 
was no clinical experience with a dosing >2.5  mg/kg. Other sites remained at  a potential  maximal dose 
of 3.0 mg/kg/. A protocol amendment was later accepted to allow this higher top dose, based on 
clinical experience. 
The applicant changed the  primary endpoint from a mean change analysis to a proportional responder 
endpoint, while  the pivotal trials were already ongoing.   
The above changes are further discussed in  section 2.5.3  of this report. 
Baseline data 
Baseline data for this  study is provided in Table 10  and Table 11. Only limited data is available for 2 
patients from the supplemental cohort whom enrolled after the 9 July 2019:  it concerned an 8-year-old 
white  female, with a baseline weight  and BMI of 44.6  kg and 28.06  kg/m2, and the  other was a 20-
year-old white male with  a baseline weight and BMI of 159.3 kg, and 68.04 mg/m2.

A summary of the  analysis sets and the  number of patients included as of 9 July 2019 are shown  in the 
below diagram. As of 30  April 2020,  4 supplemental patients had either finished 1 year of treatment  or 
were ongoing. The FAS and DUS at this  point in  time included respectively 4 and 3 of these 
supplemental subjects, however as three of them were still  undergoing treatment  at the time of data 
extraction their 52-week data was imputed. Only 3 of the 4 supplemental patients were included in the 
second or third key secondary endpoint analyses as one of these patients was <12 years.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Endpoint 
A total of 5 of the 11 pivotal subjects and 4 of the  supplemental subjects (3 of which did not  yet reach 
52 weeks of treatment and for whom data were thus  imputed) reached the primary endpoint with  a p-
value of less than  0.0001.  For the pivotal cohort the results were replicated in  the DUS and CS 
population where 4 of 9 patients reached the primary endpoint.  See Table 12. 
A fairly significant proportion of patients (55%)  failed to reach the primary endpoint. One of these 
patients discontinued  due to  an adverse event of Grade 1 eosinophilia and the last data point collected 
was at Visit 3 (Day 57  of treatment  = Week 8) where the subject showed a -1.4%  decrease in weight 
from baseline. Three patients presented with  weight decreases versus baseline between -0.1%  and -
9.8% at  Week 59 visit, with  maximal weight  losses between -5.7% and -15.3%  at earlier timepoints, 
and it was suspected that these patients were not following the  prescribed regimen of study drug 
based on their aberrant setmelanotide PK data. Two other patients had decreases of -0.9% and -2.5% 
versus baseline at last assessment, with maximal weight losses of -5.9%  and -3.7%  measured at prior 
timepoints,  without  apparent reason or clarification for their reduced performance. 
One patient had a less dramatic weight regain in the placebo period than the other subjects, the 
patient did  gain body mass, which  was shed again after resumption of treatment.

Key Secondary Endpoints 
The key secondary endpoint was evaluated in  the DUS population,  which showed a mean negative 
weight  change from baseline to W52 of +/-  13%. An overall continuous pattern of weight loss during 
treatment was seen, with  overall clear weight  regain during the  blinded withdrawal period. A total  of 
70 percent of the overall DUS population (pivotal +  evaluable supplemental patients)  achieved a 
minimum of 10% weight  loss from baseline to W52,  whereas the pivotal patient cohort in isolation 
managed a 57.1%  success rate in this  regard due to the aforementioned 6 patients  with less 
favourable or missing outcomes all being pivotal patients.  The Week 52 data for three supplemental 
patients was imputed as they did not yet complete one year of treatment.   
Results (including patients  from the supplemental cohort) are provided in  Figure 12 and Table 13: 
Time point at week 0 is indicated with a dashed line and defined as when a participant received their first therapeutic

The second key secondary was the  mean percent change in hunger from baseline to the Week 52  of 
treatment, as measured by the  worst ‘most hunger’ in 24 hours. This endpoint was evaluated in the 
DUS cohort subjects that  were 12 years or older, due to the incompatibility  of the hunger assessment 
tools with  younger aged subjects. Overall these patients managed to  achieve a mean decrease in 
appetite of 50%, however, while  80% of evaluable subjects managed to  achieve a decrease in hunger 
score of 25% or more. See Table 14.

Results from other secondary/tertiary/exploratory endpoints (cut-off date: 09 July 2019) can be 
summarised below:  
•  At Week 52,  patients in the pivotal DUS population had a mean negative change in waistline 
circumference of 7%. 
•  Overall a mean weight  gain of 7 kilograms was noted when pivotal cohort patients underwent a 
4-week IP withdrawal during the  8-week blinded withdrawal  period. 
•  During the 4-week IP withdrawal period the pivotal cohort DUS subjects saw a mean increase 
in worst hunger score in 24 hours of 2.9 units  increase, though this  change was not statistically 
significant. 
•  Of the overall weight loss, a mean of 74% was due to loss of body fat, with  no appreciable loss 
of bone density or non-bone lean body mass. 
• 
The mean BMI in the pivotal DUS patients changed -13.2% from Baseline to week 52. 
•  Observed energy expenditures showed net  reductions at the  relevant assessment points, 
consistent with  the weight  loss achieved. 
Ancillary analyses 
Immunogenicity 
In the pivotal clinical studies, RM-493-012  and RM-493-015,  ADA sampling strategies included 
collection of samples pre-treatment (identified as Screen, Day 1  or Day -1),  and post-treatment  at Day 
14, Day 29  and every 2 weeks during the dose titration  phase, then  monthly thereafter in the 
maintenance phase. For any subject with  a positive ADA to setmelanotide at  the end of study or early 
termination, the  subjects were to be assessed for ADA every 3 months until  resolution or return to 
baseline. 
The results to date demonstrate that  no antibodies specific for setmelanotide were found in  any of the 
samples from any of the clinical trials wherein ADA was assessed. Of the 79 screening positive samples 
that  were assessed in the confirmatory assay, no samples (0/79)  were confirmed positive for 
antibodies to setmelanotide. As a result, no samples to date have been tested in the neutralising 
antibody assay (NAb). 
Consistent with  the observation of no ADA to setmelanotide in the assays, there has been no observed 
clinical effect on PD or efficacy parameters, such as increased hunger or weight gain. However, given 
the issues observed in regard to  the ADA assays used (see earlier discussion), no confirmative 
conclusions can be drawn from these findings at this  point in time. 
No patient  in Study RM-493-012  had confirmed anti-
-MSH  antibodies which is in line with  the fact that 
POMC/PCSK1 deficiency patients  lack 
-MSH.  In the RM-493-015,  three LEPR patients  confirmed anti-
⍺
-MSH  samples were found, each in a different patient. Of these three samples was pre-treatment, 
⍺
while the others were temporally located in the  titration  phase, with  inhibitions  ranging from +31  to 
⍺
38%. No  effect on clinical response, setmelanotide concentration or safety could be ascribed to these 
findings, however.  
Glucose Metabolism 
With  regards to glucose metabolism, overall results showed a positive trend. However, it  should be 
noted that  only 4 patients  in the LEPR deficiency population completed the 52-week glucose 
measurement and the result should be interpreted with  caution. Likewise, changes in  HbA1c from a 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/319064/2021 
Page 90/143 
 
 
 
median of 5.6%  at baseline to 5.1%  at week 52 was observed in patients with  POMC deficiency. No 
LEPR patients had HbA1c measurements at follow-up. 
Other  analyses 
Based on data on body weight  and hunger score immediately before, during and after the  placebo 
period the  combined populations were confirmed to achieve a weight loss of 2.5  kg before, a weight 
gain of 5.9 kg during and a weight  loss of 5.1 kg after the placebo period. The accompanying hunger 
scores were 3.8,  7.0 and 4.0 respectively. Even though  these data are not statistically  tested, there is 
a clear indication of a weight gain during the placebo period compared to the treatment  period. This 
tendency was also shown in the spaghetti  plots. Hence, an effect of setmelanotide on body weight and 
hunger is supported by this  double-blind withdrawal period. 
Analysis of the exploratory endpoints showed results that  are in line with  main results seen. Results on 
body composition indicated that  the weight  loss is primarily due to a reduction in fat mass while 
metabolic parameter analysis showed results indicative of an improvement in insulin sensitivity.  
Summary of main study(ies) 
The following tables summarise the efficacy results from the main studies supporting the  present 
application. These summaries should be read in conjunction  with the  discussion on clinical efficacy as 
well as the benefit risk assessment (see later sections).

a Two-sided confidence interval (CI) obtained using Clopper-Pearson method 
and one-sided p-value obtained from exact binomial test,  testing that  ≥5% of 
patients in  the population of interest would achieve ≥ 25% improvement in 
daily hunger score. 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The proportion of patients  achieving a ≥10% weight loss from baseline was lower among those with 
LEPR than with  POMC deficiency obesity (60% versus 86%, respectively using the FAS population). 
Among patients that  did not meet the primary endpoint, PK data for 3 LEPR deficiency patients  showed 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/319064/2021 
Page 98/143 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
aberrant setmelanotide concentrations from approximately Visit 5 through Visit  12 leading to the 
suspicion that these patients  were likely not taking study drug according to the prescribed regimen. 
In the supportive investigator-led study RM-493-011,  both of the POMC/PCSK1 deficiency patients  lost 
at least 10% of body weight from screening to Visit 3 which is associated with approximately 3 months 
on study, while only one of the 3 LEPR deficiency patient  lost at least 10% of body weight from 
screening to Visit  3. 
Similarly,  to the  primary endpoint, the effect-size was far larger for the  percentage change in 
individual body weight  from baseline to Week 52 (%)  (key secondary endpoint) in the POMC/PCSK1 
deficiency patients than  in the LEPR patient  population, (mean ±  SD) was -25.8%  (±9.7) for POMC 
patients and -12.7%  (±7.4)  for LEPR deficiency obesity respectively using the  DUS population).  In the 
supportive RM-493-011  study similar outcomes were seen with mean decreases of -15% and -9% 
respectively among patients with  POMC and LEPR deficiency at Month  3. 
Differences in the overall weight-loss outcomes in  the two pivotal trials could be explained by the fact 
that  3 patients in the  LEPR-population had compliance issues (though  there were two  pivotal patients 
that  had seemingly unexplainable less favourable responses to treatment) and 1 patient  discontinued 
very early on in the study due to an AE. However, the same disparity of efficacy is replicated in the 
investigator-led supportive study (RM-493-011).  The number of POMC and LEPR patients in study RM-
493-011  was very low (n= 2 and 3 respectively) and thus it is not  possible to clearly ascribe a causal 
effect to these findings. Nonetheless, seeing the difference in outcome scores repeated in two  separate 
trials may indicate some process interfering in the  efficacy of setmelatonide in LEPR patients. The 
CHMP  recognised that given the ultra-rarity of these genetic disorders, that  such finding cannot be 
further investigated in a clinical trial  context. On the other hand, even though the  performance in the 
LEPR population was markedly less than in  the POMC/PCKS1 patients;  overall patients still managed a 
respectable mean body weight change of -13% in a year of treatment. Moreover, patients that 
underwent the blinded withdrawal  of setmelanotide did show a clear reversal of earlier weight loss 
gains, indicating that  the product is having an overall positive effect in both populations. 
As for the other key secondary endpoints, a reversed situation is observed for the  percentage change 
in worst daily hunger score, with  improvements in the LEPR patient population  outpacing those in the 
POMC/PCSK1 population  aged 12 years and above. The mean percent change from baseline to 52 
weeks (mean ± SD) was -27.1%  (±28.1)  for POMC patients  and -50.3%  (±22.1)  for LEPR deficiency 
obesity respectively using the DUS population).  Proportion of patients achieving ≥25%  improvement 
in worst hunger score was 50 % (n=4)  for POMC patients  and 78.6%  (n=11)  for LEPR deficiency 
obesity respectively using the FAS population.  In contrast, in  the investigator led study RM-493-011, 
better hunger management scores were reported for POMC patients  (mean percent change from 
baseline (mean ± SD) to  Month  3 in Hunger Score was -89.4% (±0.79)  for POMC patients with  POMC 
deficiency obesity and -64.1%  (±17.44)  for LEPR deficiency obesity patients)  and thus  no consistency 
on the hunger management scores is reported across the  clinical studies. 
In the supplemental cohort, the proportion of patients  at 52 weeks achieving at least 10% weight loss 
compared to baseline was 85.7%  and 60% in the POMC population and 60%  in the LEPR population. In 
comparison, this  was 80.0%  and 45.5% in  the pivotal population. The higher proportion meeting the 
endpoint in the  supplemental cohort could be due to a shorter follow-up time and thereby lower 
number of patients  not completing the study, as the change in bodyweight for those who withdraw 
from the  study was set to  0 kg. However, as these patients  are not part of the pivotal population no 
impact on the benefit risk balance of setmelanotide is expected.

Clinical studies in special populations 
No clinical studies in special populations were undertaken. 
Both pivotal studies included paediatric subjects, and this is further presented and discussed in section 
2.5.3  this report.  
Supportive study(ies) 
Study RM-493-011 
In study RM-493-011,  eligible patients either had homozygous or compound heterozygous (different 
gene mutation  on both alleles) POMC, LEPR, MC4R or PCSK1 gene mutations,  heterozygous 
POMC/MC4R mutations,  POMC hypermethylation (epigenetic) variants, Bardet-Biedl Syndrome or 
Älstrom’s Syndrome. All subjects had to be obese, as defined by a BMI >30 kg/m
2 
and not have any 
other curative option.  A total  of 30  patients were to  be enrolled (initially only adult patients and once 
efficacy was established in adults,  patients ≥12 years with  POMC or LEPR mutations  were to  be 
enrolled). Treatments were provided subcutaneously according to  dose titration  scheduled to 
determine the  TD level. A total  of 7 patients  enrolled, of which 2 POMC and 3 LEPR deficiency patients. 
All patients were still ongoing as of 19  February 2019,  except for 1 LEPR patient  who was withdrawn 
early due to a protocol violation. 
Overall the mean % change in weight  loss at  Month  3 from screening for POMC/PCSK1 deficiency 
patients was ~15%  and for LEPR deficiency patients ~9%,  while the mean % change in weight  loss 
from screening to 12 months for POMC/PCSK1 deficiency patients  was ~30%  and for LEPR deficiency 
patients ~9%.  In addition, BMI and waist circumference were also less favourable within  the first 3 
months of study. Mean change ± SD from baseline in BMI for the  POMC/PCSK1 deficiency patients was 
-7.73±0.75  and -3.59±1.82  for LEPR deficiency patients. Mean  change ± SD from baseline in waist 
circumference for the POMC/PCSK1 deficiency patients was -11.50 ±6.36  and -6.67±4.04  for the LEPR 
deficiency patients. 
In patients with  LEPR deficiency, there was a weight  loss during the  first 52 weeks in two  of the 
patients, where no substantial effect was seen in one of the  patients, and after the first 52 weeks of 
treatment there was a tendency towards an increase in bodyweight, even though  the dose was 
increase to 3 mg.  
For the hunger-related secondary endpoint assessment showed that  POMC and LEPR deficiency 
patients had a reduction in hunger-scores within  3 months for 1 POMC and 2 LEPR deficiency patients. 
However, better hunger management scores were reported for POMC patients (mean percent change 
from baseline (mean ±  SD) to Month  3 in Hunger  Score was -89.4%  (±0.79)  for POMC patients  with 
POMC deficiency obesity and -64.1%  (±17.44)  for LEPR deficiency obesity patients). 
Study RM-493-022 
In the extension study  RM-493-022,  up to an additional 2 years treatment, or until  drug was otherwise 
available through authorized use, patients had completed a prior study of setmelanotide for genetic 
obesity disorders upstream of the MC4 receptor in the melanocortin-leptin pathway. Visit 1 of this 
study coincided with the  final visit of the  index trial. Patients continued  taking the same dose of 
setmelanotide that was being administered at  completion of the Index Study, though dose level 
changes were allowed at  any time based on safety or efficacy findings. As of 9 May 2019, the study 
was still ongoing, a total  of 9 POMC/PCSK1 patients whom had finished Index study RM-493-012  and 6 
LEPR patients whom had finished study RM-493-015  were enrolled for the extension study. One of the

former 9 patients discontinued  prior to Week 37,  while 5 patients had reached Week 89.  All six LEPR 
patients had reached Week 25  at time of data extraction. 
The baseline disposition of the POMC/PCSK1 patients  was as follows: 4 females and 5 males, 12  to 27 
years of age at time of enrolment in the extension Study. Mean body weight of the POMC/PCSK1 
patients at  enrolment in the  RM-493-012  Index Study was 114.98  kg (range 55 to 186.7  kg) and mean 
body weight  at enrolment in the extension Study was 83.61  kg (range 54.3  to 121.9 kg). One had an 
interruption of treatment  for ~7 weeks prior to enrolling in the extension Study during which he 
experienced weight gain.  For the 6 LEPR patients the  baseline disposition was thus: 4  females and 2 
males, 13  to 32 years of age at time of enrolment in the Extension Study. Mean body weight  of the 6 
LEPR deficiency patients at enrolment in the RM-493-015  Index Study was 125.43  kg (range 89.4 to 
170.4  kg), their  mean body weight at ~52  Weeks in the Index study was 110.22  kg (range 81.7 to 
149.9  kg) and the mean body weight  at enrolment in the extension Study was 121.87  kg (range 81.4 
to 173.8  kg). Three LEPR deficiency patients requested a hiatus  of treatment  with setmelanotide after 
completing the Index Study before enrolment into the  Extension Study and were off drug for 
approximately 4.5 months before resuming treatment in the Extension Study. This delay in  enrolment 
into the  Extension Study had a marked effect on the Extension Study baseline weight  as patients 
gained weight during this  period without  treatment. 
At Week 13 of the Extension study the  9 POMC/PCSK1 patients had mean change of +0.48  kg 
(+1.12%)  compared to the Extension Study baseline and a mean change of -30.89 kg (-24.19%) 
compared to the Index Study baseline. At Week 25 a mean change of +1.78 kg (+2.53%)  compared to 
the Extension Study baseline and a mean change of -29.59 kg (-23.42%)  compared to the Index 
Study baseline was noted. 
At Week 65 data of 7 patients  was available showing a mean change of +3.86  kg (+5.93%)  compared 
to the Extension Study baseline and a mean change of -34.17 (-25.41%)  compared to the Index Study 
baseline. 
At Week 89 of the Extension Study data of 5 patients was available showing a mean change of -0.46 
kg (+0,14%)  compared to the Extension Study baseline and a mean change of -40.22  kg (-30.20%) 
compared to the Index Study baseline. 
Overall a fairly high variability was apparent in the individual patient  weight curves, and though  most 
patients maintained at least a 10% weight  lost versus Index study baseline, with the  overall trend 
being a continued weight loss versus Index baseline, some patients showed enormous spikes in 
weight.  See Figure 14.

Figure 14 : Percent  Body Weight  Change  Over Time - Index  Study Through Last Assessment 
in the Extension Study, Individual POMC/PCSK1  Patients 
Of the 6 LEPR deficiency patients currently enrolled the mean percent change in body weight at Week 
13 was -2.18  kg (-1.88%)  versus Extension study baseline and -5.75  kg (-4.47%)  versus Index study 
baseline. At Week 25 these changes were a mean change of -1.58 kg (-1.77%)  compared to the 
Extension Study baseline and -5.15 kg (-4.13%)  compared to the Index Study baseline.  
During the Index study RM-493-015,  3 subjects exhibited erratic setmelanotide PK values which were 
inconsistent with  the weight  loss noted, despite showing  the expected weight progression early on 
during their dosing schedule. Neither achieved the Index primary endpoint and all three had a hiatus  of 
± 4.5  months between finishing the Index study and enrolment in the RM-493-022  Extension study, 
with  significant weight  gains noted during  this period. Upon restart the  patients were not  administered 
their therapeutic Index dose but were instead treated with  lower doses (ongoing as of Week 25).  After 
6 months of treatment one of these patients  is showing a trend towards continued moderate loss of 
weight. 
Overall there is currently little  data, which does not yet allow to make any observations on outcomes 
or trends therein. See Figure 15.

Based on the worst (most) hunger in 24  hours, the  mean hunger score of the 7 POMC/PCSK1 patients 
≥ 12 year was 8.0 at  Index Study baseline and after ~1  year of treatment  with setmelanotide in the 
Index Study the mean hunger score at Extension Study baseline was 6.4. During the Extension Study 
mean hunger score remained consistent  for these 7 POMC/PCSK1 deficiency patients,  and at Week 37 
the mean hunger score was 6.3  but then tended to  increase slightly over time. The mean hunger score 
of 5 of the 7 POMC/PCSK1 deficiency patients  that completed Week 89 was 7.0. The mean hunger 
score of the 6 LEPR deficiency patients ≥12  year was 7.1  at Index Study baseline and the mean 
hunger score at Extension Study baseline was 5.7. During the Extension Study the mean hunger score 
was maintained during first 6 months of treatment in the  Extension Study (5.7  at Week 25). 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The clinical efficacy consisted of two pivotal studies and two supportive studies. The proposed 
therapeutic indication relates to bi-allelic POMC/PCSK1/LEPR deficiency obesities, which are of an ultra-
rare nature with  a combined worldwide known incidence of less than  200 patients.  Thus, any attempts 
with  regards to discussion on adequate design, statistical considerations and interpretation of results 
are fraught with  caveats stemming from an incessant paucity in total  available data. This in turn 
hampers efforts towards robustness and implies that observed clinical effects could be as or even more 
important in  any benefit/risk assessment as purely statistical  considerations and outcomes, in contrast 
to trials in relatively abundant  populations which allow robust statistical  inference. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Both trials were set up as Phase 3 open-label trials without  a comparator, but including  a double-blind 
placebo controlled 8-week withdrawal  period in which  patients would randomly be administered 
placebo for a duration  of four weeks. Given that  patients were allowed concomitant  treatments, 
including those that  may have had an effect on their body weight,  this blinded withdrawal  period was 
meant to ascertain that  non-administration  of setmelanotide would lead to weight gain in order to 
exclude the possibility that  any weight  losses seen would  be purely due to  causes unrelated to 
setmelanotide. The choice to not use a placebo control group was done for ethical considerations, as 
prior experience in the investigator led RM-493-011  trial had shown rapid weight losses in 
setmelanotide-treated POMC/LEPR deficiency obesity patients,  and the  fact that the number of known 
patients was very low and all of which  have high unmet  medical need and significant  comorbidities due 
to their morbid obesity. Whereas the pivotal trial design is rather unconventional, the choice of a 
blinded withdrawal period was endorsed by the CHMP  and considered adequately justified. The design 
of the pivotal studies gave the potential need to detangle the setmelanotide-effect on weight  from all 
other potentially weigh-altering concomitant treatments  that patients  could be on during the trial.  In 
the absence of available comparator, historical controls for bodyweight comparisons were used to 
support the efficacy evaluation. The choice of a historical 5% responder rate in the historical data was 
also chosen with  a conservative approach. Historical data imply that  in reality 0% of patients  would 
show a 10% weight  loss in 1 year, even with extreme measures. Still, the  applicant assumed that  a 
small proportion of patients (5%)  might show 10%  weight loss during a 1-year period. This choice was 
considered acceptable by the CHMP.   
No dose finding studies had been undertaken and the  choice of dosing was based on clinical 
observations made in the  investigator-led RM-493-011  study and those in  other indications  currently 
under investigation (Bardet-Biedl and Ahlstrom syndrome related obesity).  
The observationally informed choice of dosing regimen for the pivotal trials has methodological 
limitations  and is not  considered an optimal way of dose decision making. However, given the  ultra-
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/319064/2021 
Page 103/143 
 
 
 
rarity of the conditions  and the  particular pathophysiology which sets them apart from general obesity, 
it can be accepted that  standard dose-finding approach has not been conducted due to lack of 
feasibility. 
A maximal dose limit  of 2.5 mg was initially imposed by some national competent authorities in their 
respective national centres, since at the time when  the concerned test sites were inducted,  there was 
no clinical experience with a dosing >2.5  mg Other sites remained at a potential maximal dose of 3.0 
mg A protocol amendment was later accepted to allow this higher top dose, based on clinical 
experience. Despite more data collected with  the upper dose of 2.5  mg which  would thus logically 
become the upper dosing limit for the pivotal trials in absence of dose finding trials, an upper limit of 
3.0 mg was implemented for the pivotal trials on direct request of another regulatory authority. 
Although the  approach is not substantiated by the totality  of the clinical data, the non-clinical data 
showed large safety margins, 150-fold higher than  human exposure levels at this  latter dose, thus 
indicating  that this  choice was likely safe and can thus be accepted.  
Overall the choice of inclusion and exclusion criteria seems acceptable considering the objectives of the 
studies.  
The CHMP agreed that  strict adherence to the European guidelines on clinical evaluation of medicinal 
products used in weight management (EMA/CHMP/311805/2014)  is not  feasible as these conditions of 
obesity are different that than  the general population of obese patients. Though most of the 
POMC/PCSK1/LEPR deficiency obesity patients will  be of class II or III obesity, the  limited availability of 
subjects would make it difficult  to have a representative balanced sample of type I, II and III obesity 
subjects. Likewise, a separate analysis on the weight  lowering effect and effect on glycaemic 
parameters for type 2 diabetes patients would generally not make sense in the studied populations as 
sub-analysis are statistically  difficult given the extremely limited patient  numbers. 
The choice of primary and key secondary endpoints with  regard to the  weight loss thresholds were in 
accordance with the  European guideline cited above.  The applicant changed the primary endpoint  from 
a mean change analysis to a proportional responder endpoint, while  the pivotal trials were already 
ongoing.  The rationale for this change was driven by the  fact that the  intended patient population may 
have represented a bimodal type, which  would have potentially impacted sensitivity of the original 
primary endpoint. As such the choice to  move towards a proportional endpoint is considered justified. 
As the mean-targeted endpoint was retained as a key secondary endpoint and given that  both the 
original and new primary endpoints were met, the protocol amendment did not affect the validity of 
the results of the pivotal studies.  
The choice of the DUS population for the  evaluation of mean changes is valid given that the  FAS 
population would include patients  who do not meet the threshold for entering the  blinded withdrawal 
phase and which  could thus  lead to  a binomial distribution.   
The primary analysis was performed on the pivotal patient  sets, with separate analyses considering 
any supplemental patients  and pooled pivotal + supplemental patients. If any supplemental patients 
had not yet achieved one year of treatment at the  time of analysis, but had at least three months of 
treatment data available, then their  missing 1-year data would be imputed  using a linear model. Given 
the un-predictability  of weight  changes the choice of an LME  imputation  was considered questionable, 
but  following a sensitivity analysis using  an alternative LOCF imputation  model it was shown that  the 
choice of the former had not  influenced the outcomes.  
Dosing recommendation in adult population 
Initially, the applicant proposed a simplified dosing regimen for the SmPC. The dosing schedule was 
not reflecting the titration  schedule used in the  pivotal trials.  On the  basis that  patients with  a deficient 
MC4R pathway may react strongly to the first introduction  of setmelanotide, the  recommended

setmelanotide dose for adults with  POMC and LEPR deficiency obesity, as proposed by the applicant, 
was a starting  dose of 2 mg subcutaneous injection QD, and if tolerated for 2 weeks, increase to 3 mg 
QD, aiming to achieve a normal BMI.  
However, the  CHMP noted that  there was little  evidence of safety concerns at doses up  to 3 mg/day. In 
addition, the  rapid weight  loss seen during the trials was predominantly due to loss of fat, with  no 
evidence of fluid loss or electrolyte disturbance. The higher recommended starting  dose as used in the 
pivotal trials would possibly allow a quicker response to treatment  and less patient and health care 
system burden.  
Because the proposed simplified dosing regimen did not seem consistent  with the  clinical findings 
observed the pivotal trials, the CHMP considered the  following recommendations: 
- Since most adult  patients reached a therapeutic dose higher than 1 mg and the safe profile of the 
product within  the clinical dose range, it can be considered appropriate to forego 0.5 mg up-titration 
steps; the recommended initial starting  dose is 1mg; 
- For patient  who did not reach TD at 2.0 mg to start  with  a dosing at 2.5  mg as this  is the  highest 
dose where more than 30%  of patients in the pivotal trials reached their TD. The final up-titration  to 3 
mg should then only be used in those patients  that still  fail to see adequate weight control at a 2.5 mg 
dose.  
The above revised dosing recommendation more realistically reflected the fact that  only a minority of 
adult patients  in the pivotal trials required a 3mg TD. Thus,  a more granular final up-titration  step (2.0 
mg/2.5 mg/3mg),  was recommended by the CHMP and implemented in section 4.2 of the SmPC by the 
applicant for the adult population to  better reflect the clinical reality. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In POMC population and LEPR population the studies met the primary and key secondary endpoints. As 
those were single arm studies Historical controls were the same patients  that were included in the two 
pivotal studies and not a cohort by its  own. Based on this historical data, the median annual weight 
gain in those patients before entering the study was 5.6  kg and 6.7 kg in POMC and LEPR patients 
respectively. This is in  contrast to the weight  loss seen in the two studies. However, as changes in 
bodyweight are also age dependent, especially in children, such comparison should be considered 
relative rather than absolute. 
The primary endpoint was met by the  pivotal FAS cohort, the supplemental FAS cohort and the 
combined FAS cohort of the POMC/PCSK1 deficiency obesity patients, as more than  5% of all patients 
in each cohort achieved a 10% weight  loss from baseline to W52  at a statistically significant level for 
both defined confidence levels, and the total  amount of patients reaching this  threshold was more than 
35% of each individual and the  pooled cohorts. Similarly, the LEPR patients also achieved these 
thresholds. See Table 7 and Table 12 for POMC/PCKS1 and LEPR populations, respectively. For both 
trials, sensitivity analyses using the pivotal DUS and CS populations confirmed success on all 
thresholds. Similarly, the key secondary endpoint of mean change at 52 weeks of treatment as 
measured in the DUS populations achieved both statistically significance versus a 0 null-hypothesis at 
an alpha of 0.05  and 0.025, and 35%  of more of the subjects achieved an observed mean weight 
decrease of at least 10% versus baseline. See Table 8 and Table 13 for POMC/PCKS1 and LEPR 
populations, respectively. 
Thus, overall both trials achieved both the  primary endpoint and the closely related secondary mean 
weight  change endpoint. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/319064/2021 
Page 105/143 
 
 
 
The first key secondary hunger-related endpoint (mean percent change in hunger from baseline to 
Week52 of treatment,  as measured by the worst ‘most hunger’ in 24 hours) was met by both  trial 
populations at all predefined confidence levels, as the mean percent change was both statistically 
significantly different form zero at  both defined confidence levels and the observed mean hunger 
change exceeded the 25% threshold. Only data for pivotal patient  cohorts were available. The second 
key secondary hunger endpoint  was the  proportion of subjects achieving at least 25% improvement in 
daily hunger from baseline at 52  weeks and was also met at both an alpha of 0.05 and of 0.025.  
Other secondary and tertiary endpoints generally confirmed the primary and secondary outcomes. The 
decrease in BMI and the weight  declines associated with  setmelanotide were due to body fat loss, and 
not due to changes in bone density or lean body mass. Likewise, available energy expenditures were 
consistent with  the weight  loss effect of setmelanotide.  
No formation of anti-setmelanotide antibodies was discovered and hence no causal influence on 
outcomes could be established. Three patients in the  LEPR population developed anti-α-MSH 
antibodies, each at various discrete time points, with  varying degrees of inhibitory potential, but  no 
causal link to  efficacy or safety observations could be made. Because the immunologic assays require 
further investigation, no definite conclusions can be drawn from these observations. 
Long term data from both  supportive (ongoing) studies are consistent with  a maintenance of the effect 
of setmelanotide in  both studied populations. 
However, across the  pivotal trials, the  proportion of patients achieving a ≥10% weight  loss from 
baseline was lower among those with  LEPR than with  POMC deficiency obesity (60% versus 86%, 
respectively using the FAS population). Among patients who did not  meet the primary endpoint,  PK 
data for 3  LEPR deficiency patients  showed aberrant setmelanotide concentrations from approximately 
Visit 5 through  Visit 12 leading to the suspicion that  these patients  were likely not  taking study drug 
according to  the prescribed regimen. 
In supportive Investigator-sponsored Study RM-493-011,  both of the POMC/PCSK1 deficiency patients 
lost at least 10% of body weight from screening to Visit 3 which  is associated with approximately 3 
months on study, while only one of the  3 LEPR deficiency patient lost at least 10%  of body weight from 
screening to Visit  3. 
Similarly, to the  primary endpoint, the effect-size was far larger for the  percentage change in 
individual body weight  from baseline to Week 52 (%)  (key secondary endpoint) in the POMC/PCSK1 
deficiency patients than  in the LEPR patient  population, (mean ±  SD) was -25.8%  (±9.7) for POMC 
patients and -12.7%  (±7.4)  for LEPR deficiency obesity respectively using the  DUS population).  In the 
supportive RM-493-011  study similar outcomes were seen with mean decreases of -15% and -9% 
respectively among patients with  POMC and LEPR deficiency at Month  3. 
Differences in the overall weight-loss outcomes in  the two pivotal trials could be explained by the fact 
that  3 patients in the  LEPR-population had compliance issues (though  there were two  pivotal patients 
that  had seemingly unexplainable less favourable responses to treatment) and 1 patient  discontinued 
very early on in the study due to an AE. However, the same disparity of efficacy was replicated in the 
investigator-led supportive study (RM-493-011).  The number of POMC and LEPR patients in study RM-
493-011  was very low (n= 2 and 3 respectively) and thus it is not  possible to clearly ascribe a causal 
effect to these findings. Nonetheless, seeing the difference in outcome scores repeated in two  separate 
trials may indicate some process interfering in the  efficacy of setmelanotide in LEPR patients. A likely 
explanation for this  observation lays in the fact that in LEPR deficiency patients lose the ability to 
regulate both POMC and AGRP neurons, likely resulting  in basal low levels of melanocortin tone. In 
addition, LEPR is expressed on other (non-melanocortin) neuronal populations both within  the 
hypothalamus and in  other areas involved in  food reward such as the striatum and ventral tegmental

area. As such the  hyperphagia and obesity in LEPR deficient patients is usually more severe than seen 
in POMC deficiency and is mediated by both melanocortin (setmelanotide-responsive) and 
melanocortin-independent (setmelanotide-unresponsive) pathways. This may explain the relatively less 
favourable weight outcomes experienced by these patients.  Likewise, the  patients’ hunger feeling is 
relatively higher than that  seen in POMC/PCSK1 subjects, meaning that  similar changes therein would 
likely be subjectively experienced to a relatively larger degree. 
The CHMP recognised that  given the  ultra-rarity of these genetic disorders, such finding cannot be 
further investigated in a clinical trial  context. On the other hand, even though the  performance in the 
LEPR population was markedly less than in  the POMC/PCKS1 patients;  overall patients still managed a 
respectable mean body weight change of -13% in a year of treatment. Moreover, patients that 
underwent the blinded withdrawal  of setmelanotide did show a clear reversal of earlier weight loss 
gains, indicating that  the product is having an overall positive effect in both populations.  Interestingly, 
a reversed situation is observed for the percentage change in worst  daily hunger score, with 
improvements in the LEPR patient  population outpacing those in the  POMC/PCSK1 population aged 12 
years and above. The mean percent change from baseline to 52 weeks (mean ± SD) was -27.1% 
(±28.1)  for POMC patients  and -50.3% (±22.1)  for LEPR deficiency obesity respectively using the DUS 
population).  Proportion of patients achieving ≥25%  improvement in worst hunger score was 50 % 
(n=4)  for POMC patients and 78.6%  (n=11)  for LEPR deficiency obesity respectively using the  FAS 
population. In contrast, in the  investigator led study RM-493-011,  better hunger management scores 
were reported for POMC patients (mean percent change from baseline (mean ±  SD) to Month  3 in 
Hunger Score was -89.4% (±0.79)  for POMC patients with  POMC deficiency obesity and -64.1% 
(±17.44)  for LEPR deficiency obesity patients)  and thus  no consistency on the hunger management 
scores is reported across the clinical studies. These findings  across POMC and LEPR subgroups also 
remain to  be elucidated. 
In the supplemental cohort, the proportion of patients  at 52 weeks achieving at least 10% weight loss 
compared to baseline was 85.7%  and 60% in the POMC population and 60%  in the LEPR population. In 
comparison, this  was 80.0%  and 45.5% in  the pivotal population. The higher proportion meeting the 
endpoint in the  supplemental cohort could be due to a shorter follow-up time and thereby lower 
number of patients  not completing the study, as the change in bodyweight for those who withdraw 
from the  study was set to  0 kg. However, as these patients  were not part of the pivotal population, the 
CHMP  considered that these findings did no impact on the benefit risk assessment in the intended 
patient population. 
A total of three LEPR deficiency obesity patients were identified with  mal-compliance issues, and 
several instances of mal-compliance were also noted in outpatient  settings  in Phase 2 PK/PD trials (see 
section 2.4.4).  Additionally, the RM-493-022  extension trial included a number of POMC patients whom 
showed enormous weight spikes and subsequent falls suggestive of mal compliance, but  not 
confirmed. No  further information was made available to  allow a proper investigation of these cases.  
Nevertheless, two  categories of mal-/noncompliance were identified ie,  patients who do not take the 
drug daily, as observed in the 2 LEPR patients (RM-493-011)  and patients who take the drug in the 
evening before going to  sleep rather than  in the morning, as reported in 3  other LEPR patients (RM-
493-015),  likely resulted in the drug wearing off during the day and having minimal effect on hunger 
and weight loss. The variable pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles in the patients (RM-493-015)  also 
suggested non-compliant dosing.  In view of these findings potentially impacting on the efficacy of 
setmelanotide, the CHMP  recommended to inform prescribers in 4.2 of SmPC that  symptoms of POMC 
and LEPR deficiency obesity will  return if compliance to the dosing regimen is not  maintained.

Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
There is currently a lack of clarity on the efficacy and safety outcomes in paediatric patients  as no age-
based sub-analysis was performed. Moreover, there is a tangible paucity of data in the 6-to-12-year-
old age bracket, in particular for patients below the age of 11  years. This is however an issue that can 
be expected given the ultra-rare nature of the  conditions under consideration. In clinical studies, 14 of 
the patients treated with setmelanotide were aged 6 to 17 years at  baseline. Overall, efficacy and 
safety in these younger patients were similar to older patients studied. Clinically significant decreases in 
BMI were demonstrated. In patients who had not  yet completed their growth, appropriate progression 
in pubertal development and increases in height were observed during the study  period. 
Given that  POMC/LEPR-deficiency obesity is an ultra-rare condition with  a high unmet medical need, 
which warrants treatment as early as possible, it can be accepted that  in relation to the sought 
indication, data is available for a mere 3  patients aged between 6 and 10 years of age. The CHMP 
noted that  the number of paediatric patients included were in  line with the  current PIP requirement of 
at least one patient in the 6-12-years age category. The applicant proposed to capture Tanner scores, 
bone age x-ray results and to perform a 6-12-years subgroup analysis as part of the proposed registry. 
This is in line with  the CHMP  recommendation to collect further long-term data. 
With  regard to data for patients  below 6 years, the pivotal trial intended to recruit at least one patient 
<6 years was terminated without  such a patient having been recruited. Instead, the  applicant informed 
that  a new protocol for this very young age group will be initiated as part of PIP modification. Since 
this age group is not included in the proposed indication,  the CHMP recommended to provide the final 
study report for the planned paediatric study in patients aged 2 to <6 years of age, once available. 
Dosing recommendation in paediatric population 
A POPPK modelling was conducted to overcome the data paucity and support the  proposed dosing 
recommendation in the paediatric population. Based on these data, the applicant suggested a flat 
dosing recommendation. However, the  POPPK modelling did indicate  that age and weight  were 
important co-variates and that  a weight-based dosing approach may be more appropriate in children. 
In addition, upon CHMP  request for further validation of the POPPK model, it  was found that  the POPPK 
modelling was unable to  properly describe the PK characteristics in  this group. Given the sparsity of 
data and inherent issues thereof it was considered that  dose extrapolation towards these young 
children could not be supported by the submitted  data on POPPK modelling. As such, the CHMP 
recommended that the posology in the intended paediatric age range (6-12  years) should rely on the 
available clinical data. The CHMP  thus did  not recommend the proposed maximal dosing of 3 mg daily 
in this  age bracket since no such doses were administered in the pivotal clinical trials. The upper limit 
of dosing in patients aged between 6 and 12  years of age should be limited to  the highest dose used in 
the trials, which  is 2.5 mg daily. By analogy to the proposed posology in  adults, a granular final up-
titration  step was recommended by the CHMP  (1 mg/2 mg/2.5 mg) with  an initial  starting dose of 0.5 
mg or 1mg  dose and implemented in  section 4.2  of the SmPC by the applicant for the  paediatric 
population to better reflect the clinical reality. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The CHMP concluded that the  efficacy of setmelanotide was demonstrated in patients  with bi-allelic 
mutations  of POMC/PCKS1 and LEPR deficiency obesity genes in the  proposed dosing regimens for 
adult and paediatric (6-18 years) population.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
During the procedure, the CHMP  raised concerns over the presentation of the safety data.  Updated 
summaries of clinical safety were submitted  with  a common data cut off (10 November 2020). 
The safety dataset comprises: 
- All ongoing and completed studies from the clinical development programme to support the intended 
population (POMC and LEPR deficiency). These included healthy adult  obese subjects, paediatric and 
adult patients  with  POMC or LEPR deficiencies obesity and adult  patients with  Prader Willi Syndrome 
(RM-493-010).  See Tabular overview of the  clinical studies with some studies being conducted in 
broader population of various genetic disorders (RM-493-011,  RM-493-014,  RM-493-0122);  see 2.4.1 
Tabular overview of the clinical studies 
- Completed study RM-493-019,  US Expanded Access for the use of setmelanotide in a single patient 
with  partial lipodystrophy associated with  leptin deficiency and multiple  autoimmune diseases; 
- Ongoing study, RM-493-023,  a phase III trial in Bardet Biedl syndrome and Alström Syndrome 
patients with  moderate to  severe obesity. 
When relevant, data on RM-493-023  are presented separately as “blinded group” since the study is still 
ongoing.

As of 10  November 2020, a total of 476  subjects are known to  have been exposed to at least 1 dose of 
setmelanotide, with  52 subjects exposed to blinded study drug (either setmelanotide or placebo) in an 
ongoing, blinded setmelanotide clinical study (RM-493-023).   
Of the 476 subjects known to be exposed to setmelanotide, 228  were healthy obese subjects and 233 
were patients  with  genetic forms of obesity. Of these latter 233 patients,  a total  of 35 had LEPR or 
POMC/PCSK1 deficiency obesity. Fifteen subjects were either healthy volunteers or subjects with renal 
impaired function  (RM-493-029). 
The overall extent of setmelanotide exposure by duration of treatment is shown in Table 19. The 
median time on treatment was 54 days, with  a wide range of 1 to 1,970  days (64.6  months). A total of 
76 (16%)  patients received setmelanotide for at least 6 months, with  55 (12%)  receiving 
setmelanotide for at least 1 year.

Events of Special Interest (ESI) 
ESIs were defined as those either related to TEAEs commonly occurring during treatment with 
setmelanotide (hyperpigmentation disorders, disturbances in sexual arousal, nausea, vomiting, and 
injection site reactions) or potential  mechanistic related events such as hypertension or other events 
associated with  background disease such as depression and suicidal ideation. TEAE verbatim and 
preferred terms were reviewed by Sponsor medical personnel to identify those TEAEs that  represented 
ESIs in  each category. 
Hyperpigmentation  Disorders 
Approximately half (51%  [244/476])  of setmelanotide-treated patients experienced a 
hyperpigmentation disorder, most commonly skin hyperpigmentation (48% [229/476])  and 
melanocytic naevus (7%  [34/476]).  Other hyperpigmentation disorders events were less commonly 
reported, including  skin discoloration (2% [10/476])  and ephelides (1% [5/476]).  All other 
hyperpigmentation disorders were reported for <1% of setmelanotide-treated patients. These events 
were expected due to the  effect of the MC1R mechanism during treatment with  an MC4R agonist such 
as setmelanotide. 
For most patients who  experienced hyperpigmentation disorders, the event was assessed by the 
investigator as mild to  moderate in intensity, with  5 (1%)  patients experiencing a severe 
hyperpigmentation disorder (skin hyperpigmentation in  all cases). There were no setmelanotide related 
serious hyperpigmentation disorders; one case of melanocytic naevus was considered serious, but 
unrelated to setmelanotide. Setmelanotide interruption  due to  a hyperpigmentation disorder was 
uncommon (2 subjects; <1%). Twelve (3%) patients discontinued  setmelanotide due to a 
hyperpigmentation disorder. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/319064/2021 
Page 115/143 
 
 
 
 
Hyperpigmentation disorders typically presented 2 to 3 weeks after initiation  of setmelanotide 
treatment and remained ongoing during treatment.  The onset of hyperpigmentation disorders was 
much less common later in treatment, particularly beyond treatment Month  6. Examination of the time 
of onset of hyperpigmentation disorders in the intended  treatment population, in which  most (89% 
[31/35])  patients received treatment for ≥6 months,  suggest a similar pattern than  that of the overall 
setmelanotide-treated population that included healthy obese subjects who received setmelanotide for 
a short duration, with  55% (125/228)  receiving treatment  for <1 month. 
In pivotal Studies RM-493-012  and RM-493-015,  melanin content measurements and skin color 
measurements were performed as a sub-study. Melanin  content measurements were taken at 3 
distinct  body locations, central forehead, right upper buttock, and zygomatic process. Findings showed 
that  mean melanin measurements increased in all 3 areas during treatment without  an obvious 
relationship to sun exposure. However, a wide variability in measurements was seen in  the relatively 
small number of patients who  participated in  the sub-study (N=22),  precluding any firm conclusions to 
be drawn. Of note,  no case of melanoma has been observed among setmelanotide-treated patients. 
Sexual  events 
Overall, 72 (15%)  of 476 setmelanotide-treated patients experienced a sexual disorder, most 
commonly spontaneous penile erection (8% [36/476]),  erection increased (3% [13/476]),  and 
disturbance in sexual arousal (2%  [10/476]).  Other sexual disorders reported occurred in <1% of 
setmelanotide-treated patients overall. 
When only male patients are considered (N=193),  the incidence of penile erection, erection increased, 
and ejaculation disorder was 19%,  7%, and <1%, respectively. None of these patients reported 
prolonged erections (greater than 4 hours) requiring urgent medical evaluation. When only female 
patients are considered (N=283),  the incidence of disturbance in sexual arousal, female sexual arousal 
disorder, and libido increased was 4%, 1%, and 1%, respectively. 
All sexual events were mild or moderate in intensity and non-serious. Four  (<1%) patients  each 
required a setmelanotide dose interruption due to a disturbance in sexual arousal. Disturbances in 
sexual arousal led to setmelanotide discontinuation  for 2 (<1%)  setmelanotide-treated patients. 
Disturbances in sexual arousal typically presented within  the first month after initiation  of 
setmelanotide treatment. The onset of disturbances in sexual arousal was much less common later in 
treatment, particularly beyond treatment Month  2. 
Hypertension 
Six (1%)  of 476 setmelanotide-treated patients experienced a hypertension event, with  all such events 
being non-severe and non-serious. One (<1%)  patient  required a setmelanotide interruption  because 
of a hypertension event; however, no patient  discontinued setmelanotide because of such events. The 
patient requiring a dose interruption  due to hypertension had Prader-Willi syndrome, a patient 
population in which  hypertension is commonly seen. 
Across patient populations,  the incidence of hypertension was 3% (1/35),  2% (4/233),  and <1% 
(2/228)  among those with  POMC/PCSK1 or LEPR deficiency obesity, other forms of genetic obesity, and 
healthy obese subjects. 
Depression  
Overall, 3% (15/476)  of patients experienced a depression event, including depression (2%  [9/476]) 
and depressed mood (2% [7/476]).  (One patient  experienced the events of both  depressed mood and 
depression.) The depression event was severe for 4 patients,  and serious for 1 patient.  One (<1%) 
patient each required a setmelanotide dose reduction or discontinued setmelanotide due to a 
Assessment report

depression event.  
Although the  number of patients in the  intended treatment population is smaller, the incidence of 
depression events was higher in the population  of patients  with LEPR or POMC/PCSK1 deficiency 
obesity (26% [9/35])  than in the  overall population of patients  with  genetic forms of obesity or healthy 
obese subjects (5% [11/233]  and 2% [4/228],  respectively). However, the duration  of setmelanotide 
exposure was notably shorter in healthy obese subjects than  in patients with  LEPR or POMC/PCSK1 
deficiency obesity or other genetic forms of obesity. 
In the POMC/LEPR population, no overall worsening in depressive symptoms during setmelanotide 
treatment was evident based on review of available questionnaire data (including  PHQ-9). 
Regarding the use of antidepressants in the  POMC/LEPR population, one patient received 
antidepressant therapy prior to initiating  setmelanotide; the patient’s antidepressant medication doses 
remained stable during setmelanotide treatment.  Furthermore, 2 patients, both  with relevant medical 
history (depression/behavioural disorder with suicidal ideation),  initiated antidepressant medication 
during setmelanotide treatment. 
Suicidal Ideation   
A total of 4 setmelanotide-treated patients, 1 with  POMC (study RM-493-012)  and 3 with  LEPR 
deficiency obesity (study RM-493-012)  experienced suicidal ideation during setmelanotide treatment. 
In all 4 patients, the suicidal ideation during treatment  occurred in conjunction with  depression, and for 
1 patient,  the event was assessed as SAE, unrelated to treatment. 
Based on C-SSRS scores in Studies RM-493-012  and RM-493-015,  there is no evidence of progression 
or worsening to suggest that  setmelanotide causes suicidal ideation or behaviour. 
One additional patient (Study RM-493-023)  experienced suicidal ideation, with  this event assessed as 
serious. Thus, suicidal ideation was serious for 2 patients, of whom 1 was known to be treated with 
setmelanotide. No healthy obese subject experienced suicidal ideation. 
Nausea  and Vomiting  
Overall, 33% (157/476)  of patients  experienced nausea, with the incidence of vomiting being lower 
(12% [59/476]).  For most patients, nausea and vomiting were mild or moderate in intensity, and all 
cases were non-serious. 
Three (<1%)  of 476 patients each experienced severe nausea and vomiting. A total  of 2% (8/476)  and 
2% (9/476)  required a setmelanotide interruption due to nausea and vomiting, respectively. 
Furthermore, 2% (11/476)  and 2% (8/476)  of patients permanently discontinued  setmelanotide due to 
nausea and vomiting, respectively, making these events the most common TEAEs leading to 
setmelanotide discontinuation. 
Although the  total number of setmelanotide-treated patients was smaller than  in other populations, the 
incidence of nausea and vomiting was higher in the population  of patients  with  LEPR or POMC/PCSK1 
deficiency obesity (57% [20/35]  and 29% [10/35],  respectively) than in the overall population  of 
patients with  genetic forms of obesity (32% [74/233]  and 12% [29/233],  respectively) or healthy 
obese subjects (35% [79/228]  and 12% [27/228],  respectively). The higher incidence of nausea and 
vomiting in the indicated  population may be reflective of the  study designs, which  included a 
setmelanotide dose titration  period followed by a placebo withdrawal  period before resumption of 
setmelanotide. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/319064/2021 
Page 117/143 
 
 
 
 
 
Onset of nausea and vomiting events among all setmelanotide-treated patients  showed that  the onset 
was found most common in the  first month of setmelanotide treatment.  The onset of nausea and 
vomiting was much less common later in treatment, particularly beyond treatment Month  6. 
Injection Site  Reactions  
Overall, 39% (184/476)  and 11%  (12/110)  of setmelanotide- and placebo-treated patients, 
respectively, experienced at least 1 TEAE representative of an injection site reactions (ISRs). Overall, 
the most common ISRs were injection site erythema (24%  [114/476]),  injection site pruritus (17% 
[83/476]),  injection site induration  (11% [51/476]),  and injection site pain (10%  [49/476]);  all other 
ISRs occurred at an incidence <10%.  All ISRs were mild or moderate in intensity  and non-serious. 
Overall, <1% (4/476)  and <1%  (2/276) of patients  required a setmelanotide dose interruption  or 
discontinued setmelanotide, respectively, due to  an injection site reaction. 
ISRs were most commonly experienced within the first month  after initiation  of setmelanotide 
treatment. The incidence of ISRs was notably lower after the first month  of treatment, with  a relatively 
small number of ISRs occurring with setmelanotide administration in Month  5 and beyond. 
Overall, 920 unique  ISRs AE are included in the safety data across studies. Of these, 201 had either no 
end time or date recorded. Approximately three-fourths (77% [155/201])  were reported in ongoing 
setmelanotide clinical studies and may have an outcome date later on reported. 
Seven (<1%) of the 920  ISRs reported across all studies resulted in temporary interruptions of 
setmelanotide administration. No ISRs TEAEs resulting in temporary interruptions of treatment  were 
reported among patients with  LEPR or POMC deficiency obesity. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
There was one death reported in study RM-493-015.  The cause of the death was a result of injuries 
sustained as a passenger in an automobile accident. This event occurred after participation in the 
study for approximately 36 weeks (Day 251) and was considered unrelated to study drug by the 
investigator.  
SAE are presented in Table 24.

Note: TEAE = Treatment-Emergent Adverse Event. The blinded data up to the data cutoff date were summarized 
under the ‘Blinded’ group. 
1  The treatment assignment was unblinded for this patient, who was assigned to placebo; thus, this event is unrelated 
to setmelanotide. 
Across the pivotal studies and supportive study RM-493-011,  none of the SAEs were considered related 
to setmelanotide treatment and no patients discontinued therapy due to an SAE. Depression was the 
only SAE reported by more than  1 patient (n=3).  There was 1 SAE of cholecystitis and another of 
cholecystectomy in the index studies RM-493-011  and RM-493-015,  respectively, both occurring in 
POMC patients. In studies RM-493-012  and 014  The SAEs reported in studies 022  and 014 were all 
considered unrelated to study drug. In RM-493-014,  one patient in study had 2 separate SAEs: an 
acute myocardial infarction and a gastrointestinal haemorrhage, and 1 patient had one SAE (enteritis). 
Generally, information on these cases did not  allow to establish a causal association with 
setmelanotide. 
Laboratory findings 
Overall, 4% (21/476)  of setmelanotide-treated patients had a blood and lymphatic system disorder 
reported as a TEAE, including  anemia (9 patients;  2%), eosinophilia (3 patients; <1%),  and 
Assessment report

leukocytosis, and neutropenia (each 1 patient;  <1%). One (<1%)  patient each also had iron deficiency 
anemia, coagulopathy, lymphadenopathy, and microcytic anemia reported as a TEAE. 
Within  the Investigations SOC, 1 (<1%)  patient had neutrophil  count increased reported as a TEAE. Of 
these events, all 3 cases of eosinophilia and 1 case of anemia were considered by the Investigator to 
be setmelanotide-related. 
All of these events were non-serious, and, with the  exception of 1 case of severe anemia, all were mild 
or moderate in intensity. Three (<1%) had setmelanotide interrupted due to a hematologic TEAE, 
anemia in 2  (<1%) patients  and eosinophilia in 1 (<1%)  patient. One (<1%)  of 476  patients 
discontinued setmelanotide due to a hematologic TEAE, eosinophilia. 
Hypoglycaemia was the most commonly reported clinical chemistry TEAE (4  patients; <1%).  One 
(<1%)  patient each reported hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, 
hyponatremia, and hypophosphatemia. Within  the  Investigations SOC, clinical chemistry test 
abnormalities reported as TEAEs included blood creatine phosphokinase increased (6 patients 
(including  2 healthy obese subjects and 4 with  genetic forms of obesity); 1%) and alanine 
aminotransferase increased (2 patients; <1%);  all other clinical chemistry test abnormalities were 
reported as TEAEs for 1 (<1%)  patient only. Clinical chemistry TEAEs that  were considered by the 
investigator to be setmelanotide-related included blood creatine phosphokinase increased (2 patients; 
<1%)  and blood bilirubin increased, blood uric acid increased, hypoglycemia, and gamma-glutamyl 
transferase increased (each 1 patient;  <1%). All of these events were non-serious, and most were 
mild or moderate in intensity.   
Additionally, 1 LEPR patient experienced renal failure on day 16 of treatment (during titration  period at 
the 1.5-mg  dose) and considered by the  investigator to  be setmelanotide-related. This event was 
assessed by the Investigator as mild,  Grade 1 and resolved w/o sequelae or additional treatment 
needs and did not  require hospitalization; and was assessed as non-serious. One other patient in 
extension Study RM-493-022  experienced “chronic kidney disease stage 3” on Day 142, and this  event 
was considered unrelated to  setmelanotide by the investigator.  
Severe clinical chemistry TEAEs included hypoglycaemia (2 patients; <1%)  and 1 case each of blood 
creatinine phosphokinase increased, blood phosphorus increased, and hypertriglyceridemia. Clinical 
chemistry TEAEs leading to study drug interruption,  each in 1 patient,  included blood calcium 
decreased, blood creatine phosphokinase increased, blood magnesium decreased, blood phosphorus 
decreased, blood potassium decreased, and hypertriglyceridemia. Only 1 patient  discontinued 
setmelanotide because of a clinical chemistry TEAE (hypoglycemia). 
Safety in special populations 
No elderly patients  were included in the pivotal or supportive RM-493-  011 and RM-493-022  studies. 
In paediatric patients  (aged <12  years), the TEAEs experienced in this group were considered mild to 
moderate in intensity.  TEAEs considered treatment-related were consistent with  those reported across 
other age groups. Common TEAEs reported were injection site reactions, skin hyperpigmentation, and 
nausea. See Table 26 . 
Three paediatric patients experienced SAEs, each considered unrelated to study drug. First  patient had 
pleuritis and a second SAE of major depressive disorder. Second patient  experienced hypoglycemia 
due to a suspected adrenal crisis, and of the third patient  had a panic attack.

Pregnancy was reported in 1 patient  and this  led to drug discontinuation.  The patient  had received 55 
doses of setmelanotide. 
Immunological events 
No evidence of systemic allergic reactions or progression of skin reactions over time, that  would 
indicate the presence of ADA to setmelanotide or its formulation components was reported. There has 
been one case of mild eosinophilia in Study RM-493-015  that  led to  drug discontinuation.  
Overall, the analysis of a number of immunogenicity samples is still  pending.  
Based on the currently available data from the clinical trials RM-493-012  and RM-493-015,  it has been 
observed that 68%  (19 out of 28) of adult and paediatric patients with  POMC- or LEPR-deficiency were 
screened positive for antibody to setmelanotide. These 68% of patients who screened positive for 
antibodies to setmelanotide were inconclusive for antibodies to setmelanotide in the confirmatory 
assay. There was no observation of a rapid decline in  setmelanotide concentrations that  would suggest 
the presence of anti-drug antibodies. Furthermore, approximately 23% of adult and paediatric patients 
with  LEPR-deficiency (3 patients)  confirmed positive for antibodies to alpha-MSH that  were classified as 
low-titer  and non-persistent.  Of these 3 patients  (13%), 2 tested  positive post-Imcivree treatment and 
1 was positive pre-treatment. None  of the patients  with  POMC-deficiency were confirmed to  have 
antibodies to alpha-MSH. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted, which is considered acceptable by the CHMP.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
A total of 60 (9%)  of 638  patients in the setmelanotide clinical program, including  50 (11%) of 476 
setmelanotide-treated patients, 5 (5%)  of 110  placebo-treated patients, and 5 (10%)  of 52 patients 
for whom study drug remains blinded, have discontinued study drug due to a TEAE.  
The most common type of TEAEs leading to setmelanotide discontinuation  in the 476 setmelanotide 
treated patients were gastrointestinal disorders (19 patients;  4%), including nausea (11 patients;  2%), 
vomiting (8 patients;  2%), and abdominal pain and upper abdominal pain (each 2 patients;  <1%).  
Other TEAEs leading to setmelanotide discontinuation  for >1  patient were skin hyperpigmentation (12 
patients; 3%),  headache (7 patients;  2%), fatigue (4 patients;  <1%), and back pain, muscle spasms, 
melanocytic naevus, musculoskeletal chest pain, and ventricular tachycardia (each 2 patients;  <1%). 
In the 2 cases of ventricular tachycardia that  led to setmelanotide discontinuation, both  occurred in 
healthy obese subjects, were moderate in intensity  and transient, each resolving in  <1 minute after 
onset, and were considered by the Investigator to  be unrelated to setmelanotide.  
Discontinuation of setmelanotide due to TEAEs was uncommon in the intended treatment  population, 
with  1 LEPR patient in  study RM-493-015  and 2 patients with  POMC in study RM-493-022  discontinuing 
setmelanotide due to  a TEAE, 1 each due to eosinophilia, headache, and hypoglycemia. Of these 3 
events, eosinophilia was considered by the  investigator to  be setmelanotide-related, with the  other 2 
events considered unrelated. 
Post marketing experience 
Setmelanotide was approved in the United  States on 27 November 2020 for chronic weight 
management in  adult and paediatric patients  6 years of age and older with  obesity due to POMC, 
PCSK1, or LEPR deficiency. This approval occurred after the cut-off  date for the safety report included 
in this  application, and no post-marketing data are yet available. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety data from 15 clinical Phase 1, 2 and 3 studies (ongoing and completed) have been presented. 
These included both  healthy obese subjects, patients  with POMC-,  PSCK1- and LEPR-deficiency and 
other rare genetic disorders associated with  obesity. Nevertheless, the safety database for 
setmelanotide is still limited, both  in sample size – which is inherent to orphan diseases - and in 
duration of exposure which makes it difficult  to detect rare adverse reactions and those associated with 
prolonged or cumulative exposure. The overall number of subjects treated in the intended population 
included 2 POMC patients (study 011)  and 15 POMC/PCSK1 patients  (study 012) as well as 3 LEPR 
patients (study  011) and 15 LEPR patients (study  015). Among those patients, the majority (30 
patients) had been exposed for ≥12  months. 
The number of paediatric subjects included in the  pivotal studies is also very limited of which only 11 
patients who were younger than 12  years old.  
There are additional  safety data in other populations with  a total  of 476 exposed subjects (233  had 
genetic forms of obesity); 76 of those have been treated for at least 6 months and 55 have been 
treated for at least 1 year.  Among all setmelanotide-treated patients/subjects (n=476),  74 (≈16%) 
patients were <18 years; 40% were male and 60% were female. Considering the  target group 
(POMC/LEPR deficiency) being a very rare disease with a prevalence <1/1.000.000;  the safety 
database is considered sufficient to support the  present application.

A total of 80 patients opted to  continue setmelanotide treatment  in an extension Study (RM-493-022), 
including 12  of 15  patients with  POMC/PCSK1 deficiency obesity who completed pivotal index Study 
RM-493-012  and 12 of 15 patients  with  LEPR deficiency obesity who completed pivotal index Study 
RM-493-015.  Thus the  long term data are also limited.  The CHMP  considered acceptable to include in 
the pharmacovigilance plan, an observational Registry (PASS) with a primary objective, the 
assessment of long-term safety of setmelanotide as prescribed in routine practice for patients with  bi-
allelic homozygous POMC or LEPR deficiency obesity according to the approved prescribing information. 
The focus will  be on characterising and quantifying  the important potential  risks of special interest, as 
well as describing the safety in populations underrepresented or excluded in the clinical trials. 
The intended treatment population has several comorbidities, and there was no placebo comparative 
group in the pivotal studies. This design did not allow a proper differentiation of the comorbidity 
symptoms from drug-related AEs, thus  complicating the characterisation of the safety profile of 
setmelanotide. 
All patients included in the pivotal studies and supportive study RM-493-011  experienced at least 1 
TEAE and also experienced at least 1 treatment-related TEAE. 
Overall, the most common TEAEs among setmelanotide-treated patients, with  the corresponding 
incidence among placebo-treated patients,  were: skin hyperpigmentation: 48% (229/476)  versus 5% 
(5/110);  nausea: 33%  (157/476)  versus 8% (9/110);  headache: 26%  (125/476)  versus 15% 
(16/110);  injection site erythema: 24%  (114/476)  versus 10% (11/110)  and injection site pruritus: 
17% (83/476)  versus <1%  (1/110).  Similar pattern was observed with the  treatment related TEAEs 
(see Table 21). 
There was one death reported in a LEPR patient in study RM-493-015.  This was considered unrelated 
to study drug by the investigator.  
Across the pivotal studies and supportive study RM-493-011,  none of the SAEs were considered related 
to setmelanotide treatment and no patients discontinued therapy due to an SAE.  
As of 10  November 2020, a total of 60 (9%)  of 638 patients in the  setmelanotide clinical program, 
including 50  (11%) of 476 setmelanotide-treated patients, 5  (5%) of 110 placebo-treated patients, 
and 5 (10%)  of 52  patients for whom study  drug remains blinded, have discontinued study drug due to 
a TEAE. 
Approximately half (51%  [244/476])  of setmelanotide-treated patients experienced a 
hyperpigmentation disorder, most commonly skin hyperpigmentation (48% [229/476])  and 
melanocytic naevus (7%  [34/476]).  Other hyperpigmentation disorders events were less commonly 
reported, including  skin discoloration (2% [10/476])  and ephelides (1% [5/476]).  Skin darkening 
typically occurred 2 to 3 weeks after initiation  of setmelanotide treatment. Additional data did not 
reveal any differences of skin colour dependent of previous or ongoing sun exposure. There is no 
evidence for the  development of melanoma with setmelanotide. However, given the limited exposure 
and underlying mechanism, this event (apparition of new melanocytic lesions or evolution of such 
lesions) is considered as an important potential  risk in the RMP and is intended to be monitored 
through the  proposed PASS. In addition,  a warning in  section 4.4  has been added to  annually perform 
skin examination before and during treatment with  setmelanotide. In addition, skin hyperpigmentation 
is an identified risk and is included in the SmPC as a very common adverse reaction. 
Spontaneous penile erections, an effect associated with  MC4R agonism, have also been reported in 
about one third of setmelanotide-treated males in the pivotal studies. These were mild in nature and 
resolved quickly without  need for intervention, and setmelanotide treatment was continued. 
Occurrence of these events did not appear to correlate with  dose or duration of dosing, as the number 
of events did not  increase with dose or duration of dosing. None of the patients reported prolonged 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/319064/2021 
Page 124/143 
 
 
 
erections (greater than 4 hours) requiring urgent medical evaluation. Nevertheless, given the  clinical 
significance of priapism, prolonged penile erections are considered as an important potential risk in the 
RMP and a warning has been included in the SmPC to  consider seek emergency medical attention for 
potential treatment  of priapism. All relevant drug related sexual events have been included in section 
4.8 of the SmPC (including erection increased and sexual arousal as commonly and uncommonly 
reported, respectively). 
Some drugs that  target the CNS have been associated with depression or suicidal ideation, but the 
exact mechanism is not known. Patients with  severe obesity are known to have both  depression and 
suicidal ideation and behaviours so therefore, the background rate of depression and suicidal ideation 
in the setmelanotide studies is not unexpected. Depression is considered as an important  potential risk 
in the RMP and is included as a common adverse drug reaction in the SmPC. A warning has been 
added in  the SmPC to monitor each medical visit for any depressive symptoms and consider 
discontinuing  treatment if patients experience suicidal thoughts  or behaviours. This risk is to be 
followed up in the proposed PASS. Overall, a total of 4 patients experienced suicidal behaviour. No new 
cases of suicidal behaviour have been reported during the procedure. This risk is to be followed up  in 
the proposed PASS. In addition, the  C-SSRS scale is included in  the assessment of patients in clinical 
trials. 
Nausea and vomiting  were reported respectively very commonly and commonly with  setmelanotide in 
the pivotal studies and supportive study RM-493-  011,  and less commonly in  the other studies. One 
patient had needed dose-reduction. Another 21 patients had temporary discontinued setmelanotide; 
most often nausea and vomiting. The majority of gastrointestinal AEs leading to temporary 
discontinuation  of study drug were mild or moderate in severity and resolved. None of the patients 
with  vomiting as an adverse event to  setmelanotide developed associated electrolyte disturbances. 
Nausea and vomiting  are added as adverse drug reactions in  the SmPC.  
A total of 38.6% of the patients  treated with setmelanotide had at least one Injection site reaction. 
This is more than the  double of the frequency among the placebo-treated patients.  The most common 
ISRs (each reported in >5%) were erythema, pruritus, induration,  pain, oedema, bruising, swelling 
and ‘injection site reaction’. These consisted of 43%  of all reported ISRs. As 476  patients reported a 
total of 920  ISRs, suggesting several patients must have experienced ≥2 ISRs. All ISRs were reported 
to be mild or moderate and non-serious, which is reassuring. A total  of 6 patients  experienced a total 
of 7 ISRs resulting in temporary treatment discontinuation.  Three (3)  of these patients  were healthy 
obese and 4 patients had ‘Genetic obesity’ thus,  none had POMC/LEPR. Compared to healthy obese, it 
may be expected that  patients for which the treatment is intended to  treat the underlying condition 
may be more prone to tolerate mild (and moderate) ISRs, and this may be the explanation that  none 
of the POMC/LEPR patients discontinued  treatment due to ISRs. 
Whilst  the applicant considered the reported cases of alopecia as unrelated to  setmelanotide, the  CHMP 
noted that  alopecia was commonly reported in several clinical trials (e.g. studies RM-493-011,  012 and 
022).  Since this event may be suggestive of a potential drug relationship through cross-reactivity with 
the MC1R or the MC2R  and a causal relationship cannot be excluded (given the available conflicting 
literature), alopecia has been added in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Across patient populations,  the incidence of hypertension was 3% (1/35),  2% (4/233),  and <1% 
(2/228)  among those with  POMC/PCSK1 or LEPR deficiency obesity, other forms of genetic obesity, and 
healthy obese subjects. No signal of worsening hypertension was found while being treated 
concomitantly with  setmelanotide and antihypertensive medications. In general, patients  that were on 
antihypertensive medications prior to  study start remained on stable doses of antihypertensive 
medication throughout  the study. However, given the limited long-term data and the fact that MC4R 
agonists are linked to an increase in sympathetic tone, a pharmacodynamic effect on HR  and BP can be 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/319064/2021 
Page 125/143 
 
 
 
anticipated, appropriate warnings have been included to monitor heart rate and blood pressure, 
especially in case of overdose. 
Overall, no trends or clinically meaningful changes were observed in clinical laboratory assessments 
throughout  the studies.  
No development of anti-setmelanotide antibodies was noted in analysed samples, however 3 LEPR 
patients did have anti-α-MSH  anti-bodies at distinct  timepoints. No  efficacy or safety events could be 
associated with  the appearance of these anti-bodies, but  nonetheless their potential  impact on 
outcomes is as of yet unknown.  In addition, the suitability  of the  assays used in the immunologic 
analysis is yet to be addressed, the validity of these findings remains to  be confirmed (see sections 
2.4.4  and 2.4.5).   
No elderly patients  were included in the pivotal or supportive studies. Hence no safety data is available 
in this  population. 
Very limited information is available on pregnancy with one case report during treatment with 
setmelanotide. Since rapid weight gain or weight loss is not desirable during pregnancy, the CHMP 
recommended to not start setmelanotide, during pregnancy or while  attempting  to get pregnant. 
However, if a patient  who is taking setmelanotide has reached a stable weight  and becomes pregnant, 
consideration should be given to maintaining setmelanotide. Lastly, if a patient who is taking 
setmelanotide and is still  losing weight becomes pregnant, setmelanotide should either be 
discontinued, or the dose reduced while monitoring the recommended weight gain during pregnancy.  
There is no information on the presence of setmelanotide or its metabolites in human milk, the effects 
on the breastfed infant,  or the  effects on milk production. However, setmelanotide is excreted at low 
levels in the milk of rats treated during  the preweaning lactation  period. The use of setmelanotide is 
not recommended while breastfeeding. 
A single case of overdose was reported, whereby a patient in study RM-394-012  received a 5 mg 
instead of a 0.5  mg dose during the dose titration  phase. Section 4.9 of the SmPC adequately 
addressed this concern.  
The overall risk of abuse is considered low based on the current safety profile and expected medical 
supervision. 
No formal withdrawal or rebound study has been conducted. However, based on the pivotal data, 
weight  gain during  the placebo period in  the integrated group was similar to the weight  lost, after 
setmelanotide was resumed. This finding is suggestive of the absence of rebound or withdrawal 
symptoms since the weight  gain during the reversibility period was within  physiologic expectations. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
The number of paediatric patients in the safety set was very limited, especially in regard to  children 
younger than  11 years with only partial data. This is however an issue that  can be expected given the 
ultra-rare nature of the conditions under consideration. Nevertheless, the CHMP noted that  paediatric 
data in very young patients had accumulated to  an amount  that is significantly beyond the  agreed PIP 
prerequisites (at least one patient in the  6-12 years age category). All but  one of the 6  evaluable 
patients (3  of which  were between 6 and 10 years) reached the primary endpoint without  major drug-
related safety concerns. The CHMP thus  concluded that  the safety in  the paediatric population, 
including those younger than 11 years has been sufficiently addressed to support this application. The 
applicant proposed to capture Tanner scores, bone age x-ray results and to perform a 6-12 year 
subgroup analysis as part of the proposed registry. This is in line with  the CHMP recommendation to 
Assessment report

collect further long-term data. In addition,  a warning is included in  the SmPC to periodically assess 
response to setmelanotide therapy due to the possible impact of weight  loss on growth and 
maturation. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
SmPC. Appropriate measures including  additional pharmacovigilance activities and risk minimisation 
activities (see 2.7)  have been put  in place to  ensure safe and effective use of the  product in the 
recommended indication.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that  the risk management plan version 0.6 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that  the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the  Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with  the international birth  date (IBD). The IBD is 25.11.2020.  The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of setmelanotide with  active substances contained in authorised 
medicinal products in  the European Union  and declared that  it is not  a salt,  ester, ether, isomer, 
mixture of isomers, complex or derivative of any of them.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/319064/2021 
Page 132/143 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers setmelanotide to  be a new active substance as it is 
not a constituent  of a medicinal product previously authorised within  the European Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with  target patient  groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that  the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in  the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Labelling exemptions 
A request of translation exemption of the  labelling as per Art.63.1 of Directive 2001/83/EC  has been 
submitted  by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group for the following 
reasons: 
considering the  very low number of patients, the QRD Group accepted the  request for translation 
exemption, i.e. EN  only for the outer carton and vial label of this medicinal product. The MAH should 
explore the possibility to increase the font size to 7 points. 
The labelling subject to  translation exemption as per the  QRD Group decision above will however be 
translated in all languages in the  Annexes published with  the EPAR on EMA website, but  the printed 
materials will  only be translated in the language(s) as agreed by the QRD Group. 
2.10.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU)  726/2004,  Imcivree (setmelanotide) is included in the 
additional monitoring list  as it  contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011,  was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that  this will  allow quick identification  of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The indication claimed by the applicant is “Treatment of obesity and the  control of hunger associated 
with  genetically confirmed loss-of-function biallelic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC),  including PCSK1, 
deficiency or biallelic leptin  receptor (LEPR) deficiency in adults and children 6 years of age and 
above.” 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/319064/2021 
Page 133/143 
 
 
 
 
POMC and LEPR genes are upstream of the MC4R pathway and patients suffering usually have no to 
sub-functional levels of the MC4R  ligand α-MSH, released by POMC neurons in response to adipose-
mediated energy homeostasis signals.  
There are no available data on incidence of obesity due to POMC deficiency or LEPR deficiency. POMC 
(including  PCKS1) and LEPR deficiencies can be confirmed only following genetic testing.  Nonetheless, 
on the basis of worldwide literature, it  is estimated that less than 200 cases have been reported with 
these genetic deficiencies. Complete POMC deficiency (biallelic mutations)  results in  loss of endogenous 
MC4R agonist. As the endogenous antagonist  (AGRP) is not affected, this results in markedly reduced 
melanocortin tone, which manifests as hyperphagia (food-seeking behaviours), driving severe obesity.  
LEPR deficiency obesity is caused by bi-allelic (either homozygous or compound heterozygous) loss of 
the LEPR. In LEPR deficiency, patients lose the ability to regulate both POMC and AGRP neurons, likely 
resulting in basal low levels of melanocortin tone. In addition, LEPR is expressed on other (non- 
melanocortin) neuronal populations both  within  the hypothalamus and in other areas involved in food 
reward such as the striatum and ventral tegmental area. As such the  hyperphagia and obesity in LEPR 
deficient patients is usually more severe than seen in POMC deficiency (many patients do not survive) 
and is mediated by both melanocortin (setmelanotide-responsive) and melanocortin-independent 
(setmelanotide-unresponsive) pathways.  
Early-onset extreme obesity, unrelenting hunger and hyperphagia are common clinical features of 
these genetic disorders. The hyperphagia generally begins in infancy, and severe obesity follows 
shortly thereafter. As patients grow and develop, paediatric weight  curves demonstrate progressive 
and extreme weight gain, tracking >3 standard deviations above normal weights for age, usually 
leading to adult body mass index (BMI) values >40 kg/m2. POMC deficiency obesity patients often 
weigh over 100 kg by age 6 to 8  years, especially where there are bi-allelic POMC gene defects. This in 
turn contribute  to increased mortality and morbidity in  these populations,  including various co-
morbidity complications as well as global impairments in daily functioning  and overall quality of life. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There are currently no approved therapies nor products in development specifically for the  obesity and 
hyperphagia associated with  POMC/PCSK1 or LEPR deficiencies. 
The most used weight  management techniques used with  these patients are caloric limitation  through 
adapted nutritional strategies and gastric surgeries. However, clinical experience shows that  neither of 
these treatments result in durable clinically relevant responses, as patients suffer unrelenting  and 
unstoppable feelings of hunger. 
As such, these patients  currently experience a high unmet  need of effective treatment for their ultra-
rare condition. 
Setmelanotide, an 8-amino acid cyclic peptide analogue of naturally occurring alpha-melanocyte 
stimulating  hormone (α-MSH),  is claimed to be a highly MC4R-specific agonist and is intended to 
restore energy expenditure and satiety signalling in the  hypophysial MC4R pathway. It is to be 
administered once daily as a subcutaneous injection. 
The proposed therapy aims to induce clinically relevant weight loss and suppression of hunger feeling 
in the targeted patient  population.

3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Results from the  pivotal cohort of two separate studies in POMC (RM-493-012)  and LEPR (RM-493-
015)  were submitted to  support this application. Both pivotal trials were still  ongoing at time of 
submission and supplemental data were provided during the procedure. RM-493-012  and RM-493-015 
were of identical design, both phase III open-label non-randomised trials with an 8-week placebo-
controlled withdrawal period. Both studies included a 2-  to 12-week titration  period to establish a given 
patient’s therapeutic dosing, after which patients  would receive 10 further weeks of treatment  at the 
therapeutic dose. When certain protocol-defined weight-milestones  were reached patients would  enter 
the blinded 8-week withdrawal period during  which the patients would  randomly enter a 4-week 
treatment period with placebo. This 8-week withdrawal  period was meant to establish whether any 
weight  and hunger effects seen were indeed related to  the setmelanotide and not  to other factors or 
protocol-allowed concomitant  treatments. After the  8-week randomised withdrawal  period the patients 
would restart treatment at her/his previously established therapeutic dose for an additional 32  weeks 
in order to complete one year of treatment. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary endpoint was met in both studies at all significance levels. In study RM-493-012,  80%  of 
POMC patients achieved at least 10% weight  loss from baseline at Week 52, which was significantly 
increased compared to a historical control of 5% untreated responders (p: <0.0001,  90%  CI = [49.31, 
96.32]).  If the results (true + imputed) of all 4 supplemental patients were included these numbers 
remained statistically significant  with  85.7% responders (p: <0.0001,  90% CI = [61.46,  97.40]).  The 
secondary success criterion, a 10% observed mean weight  loss from baseline to  1 year of treatment, 
was also met as more than 35%  of all patients  reached the primary endpoint. In study RM-493-015 
(LEPR), the corresponding numbers were 45.5%  (p: <0.0001,  90%  CI = [19.96,  72.88])  and 60% (p: 
<0.0001,  90% CI = [35.96,  80.91]),  indicating  that both  primary endpoint and associated study 
success criterion were also met. In both studies, sensitivity analyses using the pivotal DUS and CS 
study sets confirmed the outcomes. 
The first key secondary endpoint, mean percent change in body weight, was also met in both studies 
at both defined significance levels. In study RM-493-012,  the pivotal patients reported a LS mean 
weight  change of -25.39%  (p: <0.0001,  90% CI = [-28.8,  -21.98])  and combined with  the 
supplemental patient outcomes (true and imputed) the outcome became -25.66%  (p: <0.0001,  90% 
CI = [-28.4,  -22.91]).  The associated success criterion was also met as the observed mean weight  loss 
at 52 weeks was greater than  10%. In RM-493-015  study,  these corresponding outcomes were -
12.47%  (p: <0.0001,  90% CI = [-16.10,  -8.83])  and – 12.76%  (p: <0.0001,  90% CI = [-15.30,  -
10.22]). 
The second key secondary endpoint, mean percent change in hunger scores, was met in both  studies 
at both defined success levels. In study RM-493-012  the  pivotal DUS patients 12  years or older 
reported a LS mean weight  change of -27.77%  (p: <0.0001,  90%  CI = [-40.58,  -14.96]).  The 
associated success criterion for this  endpoint was also met as the observed mean hunger decrease at 
52 weeks was greater than  25%. In the RM-493-015  study these corresponding outcomes were –
41.93%  (p: <0.0001,  90% CI = [-54.76,  -29.09])  and – 50.29%  (p: <0.0001,  90% CI = [-63.81,  -
36.78])  in the combined pivotal and supplemental cohort outcomes. 
The third key secondary endpoint, proportion of responders with  a >25% response in hunger 
improvement from baseline at week 52,  was met in  both pivotal studies at all specific significance 
levels. In study RM-493-012,  50%  of pivotal FAS patients  12 years or older achieved at least 25% 
hunger improvement from baseline at Week 52 (p: 0.0004,  90%  CI = [19.29,  80.71]).  The associated 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/319064/2021 
Page 135/143 
 
 
 
success criterion for this  endpoint was also met as more than 35%  percent of patients  met the 
endpoint. In study RM-493-015,  these corresponding outcomes were 72.7%  (p: <0.0001,  90%  CI = 
[43.56,  92.12])  and 78.6% (p: <0.0001,  90%  CI =  [53.43, 93.89])  in the  combined pivotal and 
supplemental cohort outcomes. 
Ancillary analyses showed results on change in waist circumference, body composition by DEXA scan, 
BMI, energy expenditure, lipid  profile and glucose metabolism that  pointed in a positive direction. 
Furthermore, no bone mass loss was seen. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Given the ultra-rarity of these genetic conditions and thus the lack of available patients,  it was difficult 
to implement a strongly powered statistical analysis. This should be factored when considering 
observed outcomes and uncertainties, such as for example potential bias induction. 
Historical comparison of the key endpoints was provided by the historical pre-treatment data of the 
enrolled subjects in both pivotal trials. This comparison showed a median weight  gain prior to entering 
the trials versus a median weight  loss seen during the trials. However, as weight  changes are also age 
dependent, such comparison should be considered relative rather than  absolute.  
Despite positive results in all primary and key secondary endpoints, comparison between the  outcomes 
in the two  studies showed that in general LEPR deficiency obesity patients have a less favourable 
response in regard to weight  loss relative to POMC/PCSK1 deficiency obesity patients, whereas the 
situation  is completely opposite in regards to improvements in hunger. It is likely that  this may reflect 
the difference in POMC/PCSK1 and LEPR expression in the areas involved in food reward. The latter is 
expressed on other (non-melanocortin) neuronal populations both  within  the hypothalamus, as well as 
in the striatum  and ventral tegmental area. These patients thus suffer from a more severe disease 
form, likely explaining the  relatively less favourable weight outcomes as well as the seemingly 
contradictory better hunger outcomes by virtue of their base hunger-level being far reduced so that 
improvements are relatively experienced as more impactful. 
Two patients in the  LEPR deficiency obesity population had unexplainably less favourable responses, 
but  it could be plausible that  their uncontrolled diabetic state, as well as the use of prednisolone by one 
subject, may have contributed  to such response. 
Analyses investigating correlations of bi-allelic or loss-of-function POMC and PCSK1 genetic mutations 
and POMC deficiency due to diverse allelic variants with the  magnitude of setmelanotide efficacy 
endpoints were also not undertaken and thus potential variability in response due to genetic factors is 
currently unknown. 
Several cases of mal compliance were noted in  the pivotal studies as well as in the outpatient  settings 
in Phase II trials. Moreover, in the RM-493-022  extension some patients  presented with  temporary 
enormous weight  spikes suggestive of mal compliance but not  confirmed.  
Currently there is a lack of knowledge on efficacy and dosing considerations in elderly, patients  with 
moderate to severe renal impairment and patients with  hepatic impairment since these special 
populations were not  included in the clinical studies. Data on patients with  mild renal impairment are 
available, but do not  allow a proper dosing evaluation since no dosage adjustments were made 
Likewise, no data are available in patients <8 years of age. The presented POPPK modelling did not 
allow for extrapolation towards the youngest children, limiting  the  maximum dosing to 2.5 mg as 
reported in the  clinical trials for the paediatric population.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/319064/2021 
Page 136/143 
 
 
 
The observationally informed choice of dosing regimen for the pivotal trials had methodological 
limitations  however standard a dose-finding approach has not been conducted due to the  ultra-rarity of 
the condition  and the  lack of available subjects in this  population. 
No development of anti-setmelanotide antibodies was noted in analysed samples, however 3 LEPR 
patients did have anti-α-MSH  anti-bodies at distinct  timepoints. No  efficacy or safety events could be 
associated with  the appearance of these anti-bodies, but  nonetheless their potential  impact on 
outcomes is as of yet unknown.  In addition, the suitability  of the  assays used in the immunologic 
analysis is yet to be addressed, the validity of these findings remains to  be confirmed. Further 
investigations have thus  been recommended by the  CHMP on this aspect. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Approximately half of setmelanotide-treated patients experienced a hyperpigmentation disorder, most 
commonly skin hyperpigmentation (48% [229/476])  and melanocytic naevus (7% [34/476]).  There is 
a clear underlying mechanism for hyperpigmentation linked to the activation of the MC1  receptor. Skin 
hyperpigmentation generally occurred within  2 to 3 weeks of treatment initiation,  continued for the 
duration of treatment, and resolved upon drug discontinuation.  
In the clinical trials with  setmelanotide, there have been no cases of melanoma until now. New 
melanocytic lesions or evolution of such lesions to  melanoma is an important  potential risk in the RMP.   
Spontaneous penile erections, an effect associated with  MC4R agonism, have also been reported in 
about one third of setmelanotide-treated males in the pivotal studies. These were mild in nature and 
resolved quickly without  need for intervention, and setmelanotide treatment was continued. 
Occurrence of these events did not appear to correlate with  dose or duration of dosing, as the number 
of events did not  increase with dose or duration of dosing. None of the patients reported prolonged 
erections (greater than 4 hours) requiring urgent medical evaluation. Nevertheless, given the  clinical 
significance of priapism, prolonged penile erection is considered as an important potential risk in the 
RMP. 
Overall, 3% (15/476)  of patients experienced a depression event, including depression (2%  [9/476]) 
and depressed mood (2% [7/476]).  One patient  experienced the events of both  depressed mood and 
depression. The depression event was severe for 4 patients, and serious for 1 patient.  One (<1%) 
patient each required a setmelanotide dose reduction or discontinued setmelanotide due to a 
depression event.  Depression/suicidal ideation are to  be considered important potential  risks for 
setmelanotide in the RMP due to the experience from other centrally acting  anti-obesity drugs, but 
overweight by itself also predisposes to depression.  
Setmelanotide is administered by daily injections, which is both  painful and inconvenient, especially for 
a treatment intended also for paediatric patients. Injection site reactions and nausea were very 
common but  are considered manageable through appropriate SmPC risk minimisation measures. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The rate and extent of absorption in function of the injection site are uncertain. The SC injection has 
been limited  to the abdomen region as observed in clinical trials.  
The clinical safety data set is limited leading to a number of uncertainties: the number of patients 
treated in the intended indication  is small so it is unlikely to detect rarer adverse reactions, and there 
is a need for longer-term data to detect adverse reactions associated with  prolonged or cumulative 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/319064/2021 
Page 137/143 
 
 
 
exposure. In addition, the paediatric safety data was very limited especially in regard to children 
younger than  11 years. 
The pivotal studies were open-label studies and were performed without a comparative placebo group 
and in a patient population with  several comorbidities. This made it challenging to determine the 
causal relationship to the  treatment, and there were patient groups excluded from the clinical trials 
while they might  be at a higher risk for developing some of the designated event of special interests as 
well as other excluded patient groups.  
The effect of long-term or cumulative use of setmelanotide on hyperpigmentation is not known and 
subjects with a history or close family history of melanoma were not  studied in clinical trials with 
setmelanotide.  This will be further monitored long-term in the  proposed PASS, although it is 
questioned if the targeted sample size of approximately 150 patients  will be sufficient.  
The risk of prolonged penile erections (>4  hours) as up until  now is not fully characterised, there have 
only been reports of spontaneous erections of short duration that  resolved without  intervention, and 
there was no signal of prolonged penile erections in pre-clinical or clinical setmelanotide studies 
contrary to the rare case reports of priapism that have been reported with other MCR agonists.  
Subjects with severe depression were not studied in  the clinical trials and it is also difficult  to 
determine whether the  depression/suicidal ideation is linked to the  underlying disease or the drug; this 
will further be followed-up in the proposed PASS.  
Nausea is considered to  be a manageable effect of setmelanotide, however the effect of the proposed 
simplified dosing on the risk of nausea has not been investigated. 
ISRs are considered to be a manageable effect of setmelanotide, however limited information on the 
case reports may have limited the  assessment on potential  risk minimisation  measures to address this 
risk. 
The clinical impact of ADAs is unknown as more data are expected and the suitability  of the assays is 
yet to be confirmed.

higher  outcomes  compared  to  an  analysis that  only  takes  into account  pivotal patients.  The  difference in  analysis 
outcomes for the POMC/PCSK1 group  is small, but larger for the LEPR patient group. This  latter group  had  however 
2 cases of mal-compliance and a discontinuation due  to AE in the pivotal group,  which likely explains the larger gap. 
Nonetheless, both aggregated and pivotal-only analyses show that all primary and key secondary endpoints are met. 
3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Setmelanotide is a MC4R agonist with  the potential  to restore lost activity in the  MC4R pathway aiming 
at re-establishing weight and appetite control in patients  with  POMC and LEPR obesity. There are no 
pharmacological treatment options for the patient populations and there is a substantial medical need.  
The fact that all key endpoints in  both the RM-493-012  and RM-493-015  trials were met, indicating  not 
only statistical but  also clinical significance, in a group of patients that  prior to these results did not 
have any effective way to manage their morbid obesity and unrelenting hunger makes the efficacy 
outcomes of prime importance in face of the  high unmet need in these ultra-rare genetic conditions. 
Equally important is the fact that  the responses seem to be durable, with  some variability, during 
follow-up of up to three years of treatment.  Nonetheless, the data set is relatively limited, and this is 
inherent to the ultra-rarity of the proposed indications.  Given the expected life-long nature of the 
treatment, the  proposed pharmacovigilance plan to follow-up POMC and LEPR patients in  a registry 
(PASS) is agreed upon. Particularly, data on weight  trajectory and discontinuation are planned to be 
collected in this registry, and these are considered relevant to monitor the maintenance of the effect of 
setmelanotide in the indication applied for. 
Some efficacy uncertainties were identified such as the relative less favourable hunger scores despite 
relative better weight  scores in LEPR deficiency obesity patients  versus POMC/PCSK1 deficiency obesity 
patients, the  dosing choices and the lack of data in special populations, as well as the paucity of safety 
data in certain age groups. However, these are not  expected to have a significant impact over the 
clinically proven benefits of setmelanotide in the intended treatment  population. In particular, despite 
safety and efficacy data in children below the age of 11 years was limited, the number of patients is in 
line with  the PIP requirement of at least one patient in  the 6-12 years age category.  Also, neither the 
originally proposed POPPK model, nor a model refitted to a two-compartment type, would be able to 
adequately support any kind of dosing extrapolation to young children, a titration  to effect and 
acceptable tolerance can be supported by the limited  clinical observations available.  
The uncertainties regarding the limited  clinical safety dataset (n=35) in  the proposed indication is to be 
addressed by the proposed observational Registry (PASS). Moreover, there are safety data from a total 
of 377 exposed subjects including some preliminary data from the ongoing long-term extension study 
providing data for a total up to  about 3 years in some POMC-patients that  demonstrate a generally well 
tolerated and safe profile of setmelanotide with no patients  who discontinued treatment due to drug-
related AEs. The safety profile based on the limited data seems to be reassuring, but  caution is 
warranted due to  experience from other centrally acting anti-obesity products.  
The important potential risks of melanoma, prolonged penile erections and depression/suicidal 
thoughts  can be accepted taking into account the unmet medical need for which setmelanotide is used 
and the fact that these risks will be further monitored long-term in  the proposed PASS. Overall, the 
safety issues noted are important, but  this importance is not of such magnitude that  it would overtly 
negatively influence the overall benefit of the treatment as shown by the  highly favourable outcomes.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Overall, the favourable outcomes, both  in a statistical and clinically relevant sense, on body weight and 
hunger suppression in the ultra-rare conditions of POMC/PCSK1 deficiency obesity and LEPR deficiency 
obesity are promising for a patient population that  until  now suffers from a high  unmet medical need 
due to the absence of an effective durable treatment for their condition. Although potential risks are 
identified these are not considered to  outweigh the benefits of Setmelanotide in the  proposed 
indication. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Imcivree is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP  review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that  the benefit-risk balance of Imcivree is favourable in the following indication: 
Imcivree is indicated for the treatment of obesity and the control of hunger associated with  genetically 
confirmed loss-of-function biallelic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), including  PCSK1, deficiency or 
biallelic leptin receptor (LEPR) deficiency in  adults and children 6 years of age and above. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription. (See Annex I: Summary of 
Product  Characteristics, section 4.2) 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety  Update  Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the  list of Union reference dates (EURD list)  provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC  and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this  product 
within  6 months following  authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management  Plan  (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/319064/2021 
Page 142/143 
 
 
 
agreed RMP presented in Module  1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important  (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation)  milestone being 
reached.  
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP  review of the  available data, the CHMP considers that  setmelanotide is a new 
active substance as it is not a constituent  of a medicinal product previously authorised within  the 
European Union. 
Paediatric Data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the  available paediatric data of studies  subject to  the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0164/2018  and the results of these studies are reflected in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Advanced Accelerator Applications submitted on 8 October 2015 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for SomaKit TOC, through the centralised procedure 
falling within the Article 3(1) and point 4 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the 
centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 26 February 2015. 
SomaKit TOC was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/15/1450 on 19 March 2015 for Diagnosis 
of gastro-entero-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: “This medicinal product is for diagnostic use only. After 
reconstitution and radiolabelling with 68-Gallium (68Ga) chloride solution, the solution obtained is indicated in 
adults for the diagnosis and management of somatostatin receptor bearing gastroenteropancreatic 
neuroendocrine tumours (GEP-NET), including their localisation, characterisation, staging and restaging 
through positron emission tomography (PET). Gallium (68Ga) edotreotide binds to somatostatin receptors. 
Tumours which do not bear somatostatin receptors will not be visualised.” 
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan Medicinal 
Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of SomaKit TOC as an orphan medicinal product in the approved 
indication. The outcome of the COMP review can be found on the Agency's website: ema.europa.eu/Find 
medicine/Rare disease designations. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 10(a) of Directive 2001/83/EC – relating to applications relying on well-established medicinal use 
supported by bibliographic literature. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical and 
clinical data based on bibliographic literature substituting all non-clinical tests and clinical studies 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Not applicable. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to 
the proposed indication.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) are characterised by the expression of general markers (neuron specific 
enolase, chromogranin, synaptphysin) and are hormone secretion products. They represent a very 
heterogeneous group of neoplasms that can occur at in part of the body despite having a shared origin from 
neuroendocrine cells. They arise from the endocrine cells within glands (adrenal medulla, pituitary, 
parathyroid) or from endocrine islets in the thyroid, the pancreas, or the respiratory and gastrointestinal 
tract. Common types of NETs are located in the gastrointestinal tract or the pancreas and are collectively 
referred to as gastroenteropancreatic (GEP-) NETs. GEP-NETs constitute a heterogeneous group of tumours 
with their origin in neuroendocrine cells of the embryological gut (Öberg et al. 20121).   
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
GEP-NETs are relatively rare but with an increasing incidence. The incidence of GEP-NET tumours was 
estimated at less than 12/million population in the southern European countries (Spain, Portugal, Greece, 
France, Italy), and between 12 and 24/million in the northern countries (Switzerland, Austria, UK, Scotland, 
Ireland, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Germany, and The Netherlands). 
For NETs, Taal and Visser (2004)2 reported on age-standardised incidence rates for carcinoids varying from 
0.65 to 2.5 per 100,000 inhabitants. In eight European countries the age-standardised incidence of carcinoids 
is maximally 2.5 per 100,000 inhabitants (Taal and Visser 20042; Lepage 20043; Lepage 20074). However, 
carcinoids do not include islet cell tumours of the pancreas. Endocrine pancreatic tumours are uncommon 
tumours occurring in approximately 1 in 100,000 of the population (Bieligk 19955; Öberg 20056). Therefore, 
the incidence of GEP-NETs can be estimated at maximally 3.5/100,000 inhabitants. 
Data on survival of patients with GEP-NETs in population-based studies is rarely reported. However, survival 
data published by Taal and Visser (Taal 2004), correlating extent of disease with the percentage of GEP-NET 
patients surviving at 5-years, gives 93% for local disease, 74% for regional disease and 19% for metastatic 
disease. It is likely that the rate of patients with distant metastases is underestimated (Lebtahi 19977) as 
better imaging techniques have helped with the detection of GEP-NETs. Therefore the mean survival is 
estimated to be between 6 and 8 years.

For GEP-NETs, no specific prevalence data are available for Europe. Prevalence can be estimated by 
multiplying the incidence with the mean survival time since initial diagnosis (Points to Consider on the 
Calculation and Reporting of the Prevalence of a Condition for Orphan Designation, 26 March 2002, Doc ref. 
COMP/436/01). With the reported maximum incidences of midgut NETs and islet cell tumours of 3.5 (2.5 + 
1) per 100,000 and a median survival of 6 to 8 years, the prevalence of GEP-NETs can be estimated at 
maximally 2.8 per 10,000 inhabitants in the Community. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
The classification of NETs has evolved over the past two decades to reflect a separation in two current major 
categories according to the 2010 WHO nomenclature and classification of neuroendocrine neoplasms of the 
digestive system (Rindi et al. 20108):  
1) well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) traditionally referred to as “carcinoid and pancreatic 
neuroendocrine (islet cell) tumours”, and  
2) poorly-differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) traditionally referred to as “small cell NECs and 
large cell NECs”. 
Therefore, the term GEP-NETs refers to the 2010 WHO well-differentiated NETs located at the oesophagus, 
the oesophagogastric junction, stomach, ampullary region, small intestine, appendix, colon and rectum, and 
canal, liver and intrahepatic bile ducts, gallbladder and extrahepatic bile ducts, and pancreas).  NETs of 
unknown primary tumour site (also known as CUP-NETs) are mostly GEP-NETs. 
A unique feature of well-differentiated GEP-NETs is their overexpression of somatostatin receptors (SSTR) on 
the tumour cells. Several types of tumours are known to significantly express SSTR. According to the EANM 
guideline, the following tumours have a high SSTRs expression (Virgolini 20109): 
• 
Functioning and non-functioning gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (GEP-NET), gastrinoma, 
insulinoma, glucagonoma, VIPoma, etc.), 
•  Sympathoadrenal system tumours (phaeochromocytoma, paraganglioma, 
neuroblastoma,ganglioneuroma) 
•  Medullary thyroid carcinoma 
• 
Pituitary adenoma 
•  Medulloblastoma 
•  Merkel cell carcinoma 
•  Meningioma 
Out of the five subtypes of human somatostatin receptors (sstrs) which have been identified, most abundant 
in GEP-NETs is sstr2, followed by equal amounts of sstr1 and sstr5, lower amounts of sstr3 and hardly any

sstr4 (Johnbeck et al. 201410, Maxwell et al. 201511).  Poorly-differentiated NECs hardly express somatostatin 
receptors. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation 
The diagnosis of GEP-NETs is based upon: (1) clinical features, especially in functioning tumours, (2) levels, 
in blood and urine, of several peptides and amines produced by the tumour (biomarkers), (3) localization of 
the primary and/or metastatic lesions as determined by imaging studies, and (4) histopathologic confirmation 
from biopsy or surgical specimen, which represents the ‘gold standard’ for diagnosis and should be obtained 
whenever possible (Plöckinger et al. 200412). 
2.1.5.  Management 
Many different imaging techniques are used to localize GEP-NETs. Cross-sectional (anatomical) imaging 
modalities, such as ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
have been used to localize primary lesions and to stage the extent of the disease. In the European 
consensus guidelines it is acknowledged that somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) using Octreoscan 
is an important part of the diagnostic work-up of patients with GEP-NETs (Delle Fave et al. 201213, 
Ramage et al. 201214, Öberg et al. 2012). It can still be considered the molecular imaging technique of 
choice at diagnosis and follow-up in the majority of patients with well-differentiated GEP-NET (level of 
evidence 3, grade of recommendation A/B) (Toumpanakis et al. 201415). 
The currently approved imaging diagnostic agent based on SSTRs for visualizing GEP-NETs is 
Octreoscan, which is an octreotide (pentetreotide) radiolabelled with indium-111, and has been granted 
marketing authorization in many member states of the EU. It binds with a high affinity to sstr2, a much 
lower affinity to sstr5 and sstr3, and no affinity to sstr1 and sstr4. It has been for many years the 
radiopharmaceutical of first choice for the visualization of GEP-NETs.   
Octreoscan emits gamma radiation and thus imaging is obtained by either planar gammacameras or 
single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The diagnostic sensitivity depends on the 
tumour type and receptor status since GEP-NETs are found to express somatostatin receptors in 80-
100% of cases but insulinomas have a lower prevalence (50-70%) (Johnbeck et al. 2014, Toumpanakis 
et al. 2014). Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) with Octreoscan has the additional advantage of 
instantaneous whole body scanning, which also allows detection of metastases outside the abdominal 
region. In addition to anatomical information, SRS offers functional information on levels of 
somatostatin-receptor expression; this can help in the selection of appropriate candidates with advanced 
disease for somatostatin-based therapies. Indeed, patients who are considered candidates for PRRT

should first undergo SRS to confirm a vid tracer uptake by the tumor lesions (level of evidence 3, grade 
of recommendation A/B) (Toumpanakis et al. 2014). 
There are limitations to SRS with Octreoscan which include: (1) reduced sensitivity in smaller (sub-
centimetre) lesions and in lesions exhibiting low receptor density; (2) 2-day imaging protocol; (3) 
potential interference by co-administration of therapeutic somatostatin analogues and (4) imaging 
organs with higher physiologic uptake (eg, liver) (Ramage et al. 2012, Ambrosini et al. 2014 16).  
Positive findings on SRS reflect increased density of SST receptors rather than malignant disease, and 
therefore uptake is not only specific for malignant tumours. The physiological distribution of the 
radiopharmaceutical in a variety of benign conditions (autoimmune diseases, granulomas, radiation 
pneumonitis, and bacterial infections) and non-NETs (lymphomas, melanomas, sarcomas, and breast 
cancer) could interfere with the interpretation of the images. 
PET/CT (positron emission tomography/computer tomography), using different radiopharmaceuticals has 
been introduced for the diagnostic work-up of GEP-NETs in the last decade. Fluorodopa (18F), showing 
an increase of intracellular transport and of decarboxylation of dihydroxyphenylalanine, is approved at 
the national level in the EU for the staging and detection in case of reasonable suspicion of recurrent or 
residual disease of GEP-NETs in adults and children, and for localization of insulinomas in children. 
Three gallium (68Ga)-labelled somatostatin analogs, with a high affinity to sst2 and variable affinity to 
other somatostatin receptors on the tumor cell surface, are also used in clinical practice: gallium (68Ga)-
DOTATOC, gallium (68Ga)-DOTATATE and gallium (68Ga)-DOTANOC, 17,18. 
Gallium (68Ga)-labelled somatostatin analogues for PET are currently used in clinical practice, although 
no formal randomized trials have been performed, and hence there are some guidelines for PET/CT 
tumour imaging procedures that have been recently published (Virgolini et al. 2010). PET imaging with 
gallium (68Ga)-labelled somatostatin analogues has several advantages compared with indium (111In) 
pentetreotide SRS including better spatial resolution, whole-body scanning in a short time, and the 
added value of fusion imaging using a PET/CT hybrid scanner. The gallium (68Ga) isotope has the 
advantage of being produced from a generator, and thus can be used in hospital departments that do 
not have access to a cyclotron.   
Gallium (68Ga) edotreotide is a radiopharmaceutical product used for functional imaging with positron 
emission tomography (PET) when the increased expression of somatostatin receptor (SSTR) is a diagnostic 
target. The rationale for its use in the assessment of SSTR expressing tumours is based on its high affinity for 
those receptors. 
About the product 
SomaKit TOC is a novel radiopharmaceutical composed of edetreotide, a somatostatin analogue. It is a kit for 
radiopharmaceutical preparation to be radiolabelled with gallium (68Ga) chloride obtained from a germanium 
(68Ge)/gallium (68Ga) generator. The solution obtained, known as gallium (68Ga) edetreotide or gallium (68Ga) 
edotreotide, is intended for the diagnostic work-up of GEP-NETs by PET. This solution has a half-life of 68

receptor subtype 2 (sstr2), and to a lesser extent to subtypes 1 and 5. Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other 
diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals for tumour detection, ATC code: V09IX09. 
Gallium (68Ga a) edotreotide binds to somatostatin receptors. In vitro, this radiopharmaceutical binds with 
high affinity mainly toSSTR2 but also, to a lesser extent, to SSTR5. In vivo, quantitative correlation was not 
assessed between gallium (68Ga) edotreotide uptake in tumours and the overexpression of SSTR in 
histopathological samples neither in GEP-NET patients nor in normal organs. Moreover, the in vivo binding of 
gallium (68Ga) edotreotide to other structures or receptors remains unknown. 
SomaKit TOC 40 micrograms kit for radiopharmaceutical preparation contains: 
- 
Powder for solution for injection: the vial contains a white lyophilised powder. 
-  Reaction buffer: the vial contains a clear, colourless solution. 
For radiolabelling with gallium (68Ga) chloride solution. Each vial of powder contains 40 micrograms of 
edotreotide.  The radionuclide is not part of the kit. The vial of buffer contains approximately 32.5 mg of 
sodium. For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The following indication was proposed by the applicant: 
“This medicinal product is for diagnostic use only. 
After reconstitution and radiolabelling, the 68Ga-edotreotide solution obtained is indicated for the diagnosis 
and  management  of  somatostatin  receptor  bearing  gastro-entero-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours 
(GEP-NET) in adults, for the localisation, characterisation, staging and restaging through positron emission 
tomography (PET). 
68Ga-edotreotide binds to somatostatin receptors. Tumours which do not bear somatostatin receptors will not 
be visualised.” 
The final indication is as follows: 
“This medicinal product is for diagnostic use only. 
After radiolabelling with gallium (68Ga) chloride solution, the solution of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide obtained is 
indicated for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging of somatostatin receptor overexpression in adult 
patients with confirmed or suspected well-differentiated gastro-enteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours 
(GEP-NET) for localizing primary tumours and their metastases. 
The medicinal product should only be administered by trained healthcare professionals with technical 
expertise in using and handling nuclear medicine diagnostic agents and only in a designated nuclear medicine 
facility.” 
Posology 
The recommended activity for an adult weighing 70 kg is 100 to 200 MBq, administered by direct slow 
intravenous injection. 
The activity will be adapted to patient characteristics, the type of PET camera used and acquisition mode.

Type of Application and aspects on development 
This is an application in accordance with article 10a of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended. 
The submitted clinical documentation is being based on data available in published literature. 
This is an application based on “well established medicinal use” according to Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Therefore, it is possible to replace results of pharmacological and toxicological tests or clinical trials by 
detailed references to published scientific literature (information available in the public domain). The 
applicant has demonstrated that edotreotide has a well-established medicinal use within the Community for 
at least ten years, with recognised efficacy and an acceptable level of safety, at least 10 years have passed 
since its first systematic and documented use as a medicinal product in the European Union and has been 
extensively used for the 10-year period through Europe. 
The following criteria for the demonstration of such well-established were taken into account: 
• 
The company provided data since the first use of the product in Europe in clinical practice and published 
studies. In published data more than 1,000 patients with NET tumours not only GEP-NET (800 in papers 
and more than 200 in abstracts), from different centres and investigation groups in various European 
countries mostly Germany and Austria, have received gallium (68Ga) edetreotide since 2001 up to 2016. 
In France there is a name-patient used program for this radiopharmaceutical. Besides, the applicant 
mentioned a survey in 25 European centres showing that the number of exams since the first use of 
gallium (68Ga) edetreotide in 2005 has been 23,739 in clinical practice (mostly in Italy and Germany). 
•  Several European clinical and procedural guidelines from leading scientific societies (ESMO, ENETS and 
EANM) acknowledge the value of gallium (68Ga) edetreotide (or 68Ga labelled somatostatin analogues) for 
some objectives in the diagnostic and management of GEP-NET (Virgolini et al., 2010, Oberg et al. 2012, 
Falconi et al. 2016, Niederle et al. 2016, Pape et al. 2016, Pavel et al. 2016 and Delle Fave et al. 2016). 
This would demonstrate the degree of scientific interest in the use of the substance (reflected in the 
published scientific literature) and the coherence of scientific assessments. 
• 
It can be considered that the scientific interest in the use of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide for some 
particular diagnostic objective of GEP-NET through Europe is shown based on the published scientific 
literature. The company initially provided with 31 tabulated papers assessing the clinical efficacy of 
gallium (68Ga) edotreotide in the diagnostic work-up of 970 patients with NET tumours (not only GEP-
NETs) in Europe (except 1 paper from India with 7 patients), from different centers and investigation 
groups in various European countries mostly Germany and Austria, since 2001 up to 2016 covering a 
period that is longer than the last 10 years. No data from compassionate use program have been 
submitted although compassionate use was available in some Member States (e.g. France).   
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as kit for radiopharmaceutical preparation containing 40 micrograms of 
edotreotide as active substance. As all kits for radiopharmaceutical preparation, it is not intended for direct 
administration to the patient. Instead, it must be radiolabelled immediately before use with a gallium (68Ga) 
chloride solution to generate a gallium (68Ga) edotreotide injection, which is the product actually injected to

as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of edotreotide is 2-[4-[2-[[(2R)-1-[[(4R,7S,10S,13R,16S,19R)-10-(4- aminobutyl)-4-
[[(2R,3R)-1,3-dihydroxybutan-2-yl]carbamoyl]- 7-[(1R)-1-hydroxyethyl]-16-[(4-hydroxyphenyl)methyl]-13- 
(1H-indol-3-ylmethyl)-6,9,12,15,18-pentaoxo-1,2-dithia- 5,8,11,14,17-pentazacycloicos-19-yl]amino]-1-oxo-
3- phenylpropan-2-yl]amino]-2-oxoethyl]-7,10- bis(carboxymethyl)-1,4,7,10-tetrazacyclododec-1-yl]acetic 
acid corresponding to the molecular formula C 65H92N14O18S2 (CH3COOH)n. It has a relative molecular mass 
of 1,420.6 g/mol and the following structure:

(CH3COOH)n 
Figure 1:Structure of edotreotide. 
The structure of edotreotide was confirmed by suitable tests and they have been adequately described. 
The active substance is a white to off white powder, freely soluble in water. Edotreotide is a peptide with 8 
amino acids and with a covalently bound chelator 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid 
(also known as DOTA) . The molecule is cyclised through a disulfide formation of the SH groups of the 
cysteines. The counter ion of the molecule is acetate.  
Edotreotide exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of few chiral centres. Enantiomeric purity is 
controlled. 
Polymorphism is not relevant for the active substance since it is dissolved before being incorporated into 
finished product. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted part of 
the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
One manufacturing site is proposed for the manufacture of the active substance. Edotreotide is produced by 
“classical” peptide synthesis. The process consists of 8 main steps using commercially available well defined 
starting materials with acceptable specifications.  
Adequate  in-process  controls  are  applied  during  the  synthesis.  The  specifications  and  control  methods  for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
The manufacturer has investigated all possible sources for impurities (e.g. originating from starting materials, 
side products of the manufacturing process, formed during storage, etc.) that could be present in the 
chemical precursor. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and 
characterised. The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU 
Assessment report  
EMA/734748/2016 
Page 15/104 
  
  
 
guideline on chemistry of new active substances and in the light of the Ph. Eur. monograph on chemical 
precursors for radiopharmaceutical preparations (Ph. Eur. 2902).  
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance, identification (Sequencing (MS-MS), 
monoisotopic mass (mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF)), amino acid analysis (GC), enantiomeric purity (GC), 
specific optical rotation (polarimeter), net peptide content (GC), peptide content (GC), assay (RP-HPLC), 
peptide purity (RP-HPLC), peptide related substances/impurities (RP-HPLC), residual solvents (GC), residual 
trifluoroacetic acid (GC), counter ion content (GC), water content (GC), microbial contamination / bioburden 
(Ph. Eur.), and bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.). 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines except the HPLC method proposed for assay.  
In  this  regard,  the  CHMP  recommended  completing  the  validation  of  the  HPLC  method  proposed  for  the 
determination  of  edotreotide  content  (assay)  and  updating 
the  ASMF  accordingly,  before 
the 
commercialisation of the finished product.    
Batch analysis data (three commercial scale batches) of the active substance are provided. The results are 
within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on two commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored in 
the intended commercial package under long term conditions at -20°C ± 5°C and under accelerated 
conditions at 25°C±2°C/60%± 5% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The following 
parameters were tested: appearance, peptide purity, peptide related substances, monoisotopic mass, water 
content, counterion content (acetate), TFA, assay, bacterial endotoxins, and bioburden. The analytical 
methods used were stability indicating. 
Results of the accelerated stability testing showed that the peptide purity remains constant. Hence it was 
concluded that a short term handling of the bulk material at room temperature does not have a negative 
impact on the quality of the precursor peptide. Data of the long term stability program confirm that the 
substance is stable over a maximum period of 12 months when stored at ≤ -15°C in the proposed container. 
Additional supportive stability data from on one commercial scale batch in cryovials stored over 38 months at 
-20 °C +/- 5 °C were provided.  
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. No change in the 
appearance was observed. Although the results of the peptide purity after light exposure are within the 
specification, it can be shown that the product DOTA-TOC is sensitive to light. As the bulk material is 
intended to be stored in freezers protected from light, an overexposure to light is not expected. 
Additional stress testing was performed on one batch. Samples were exposed to acid, base, oxidizing, 
oxidizing and basic conditions, and dissolution in pure water. 
Assessment report  
EMA/734748/2016

The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 12 months when stored at ≤ -15°C in the 
proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The applicant developed the finished product as a sterile 2-vial kit which consists of:  
•  Vial 1: edotreotide, 40 μg, powder for solution for injection, to be reconstituted with a solution of gallium-
68 chloride (68GaCl) in HCl (eluted from a 68Ge/68Ga generator);  
•  Vial 2: Reaction buffer: to be added to the reconstituted Vial 1.  
The applicant developed SomaKit TOC, 40 µg, as a kit for radiopharmaceutical preparation intended for use in 
a  hospital  radiopharmacy  for  the  preparation  of  the  radiolabelled  imaging  product  68Ga-edotreotide  solution 
for injection after reconstitution with gallium (68Ga) chloride solution for radiolabelling. The physico-chemical 
properties of edotreotide have been considered when choosing the manufacturing process for Vial 1 in order 
to  achieve  the  intended  dosage  form.  The  compatibility  of  the  active  substance  with  the  excipients  used  in 
the finished product has been demonstrated by the stability studies. 
The excipients chosen for the composition of Vial 1 are added to maintain stability of the active substance in 
the  final  formulation,  to  assure  safety  and  efficacy  of  the  finished  product  and  also  to  obtain  the  required 
radiochemical  purity  of 
the 
68Ga  edotreotide 
solution  during 
the 
reconstitution  procedure. 
1,10-phenanthroline  is  a  novel  excipient,  therefore  a  full  toxicological  evaluation  and  risk  assessment  have 
been  done on  the  basis  of  studies published in  the literature.  As  it is  a  novel excipient,  appropriate  data  to 
support  the  quality  and  control  of  this  excipient  has  been  provided  in  line  with  the  requirements  of  the 
Guideline on Excipients in the Dossier for Application for Marketing Authorisation of a Medicinal Product (Doc. 
Ref. EMEA/CHMP/QWP/396951/2006, 19 June 2007).  
The  formulation  development  of  Vial  1  was  performed  with  the  aim  of  identifying  the  reaction  mixture 
composition  able  to  allow  a  simple  labelling  of  the  DOTA-peptide,  based  on  direct  reconstitution  with  the 
eluate  from  commercially  available  68Ge/68Ga  generators,  without  any  processing  of  the  eluate  or  any 
additional purification step.  
The aim of the formulation development of the Vial 2 reaction buffer was to define a formulation that allows 
radiolabelling of edotreotide with high and reproducible complexation yields, by direct reconstitution with the 
eluate  from  the  68Ge/68Ga  generator.  This  direct  reconstitution  approach  makes  the  labelling  process 
independent of automatic synthesis modules.  
A  justification  of  the  designed  manufacturing  process  for  vial  1  has  been  presented.  The  choice  of  the 
sterilisation method has been adequately justified.  
The buffer vial (Vial 2) is prepared using a standard manufacturing process for sterile products.. 
The primary packaging for Vial 1 is Type I glass vial closed with a chlorobutyl rubber stopper sealed with a 
flip-off cap and, for Vial 2 a cyclic olefin polymer vial closed with a teflon stopper sealed with a flip-off cap. 
Assessment report  
EMA/734748/2016 
Page 17/104 
  
  
 
The  materials  comply  with  Ph.  Eur.  and  EC  requirements.  The  choice  of  the  container  closure  system  has 
been appropriately validated for the intended use of the product. 
Compatibility  studies  performed  by  the  applicant  following  the  same  radiolabelling  procedure  as  the  one 
proposed  for  the  end  user  in  the  hospital,  demonstrated  that  the  radiopharmaceutical  kit  provides  a 
radiolabelled finished product within the required quality specification.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  of  Vial  1  consists  of  6  main  steps:  bulk  solution  preparation,  pre-filtration, 
sterilizing filtration, aseptic filling, lyophilisation and visual inspection, labelling and packaging. The process is 
considered to be a non-standard manufacturing process. 
The  acceptance  criteria  for  in-process  control  tests  have  been  well  justified  by  the  validation  data  of 
manufacturing process which was consistent from batch to batch and demonstrated that the process is well 
controlled within the selected limits. There are no intermediates involved in the manufacturing process of the 
finished products. 
This non-standard manufacturing process has been validated on three consecutive production scale batches. 
The results are considered satisfactory. 
The manufacturing process of Vial 2 consists of 7 main steps: bulk solution preparation, pre-filtration, aseptic 
filling, sealing and crimping, terminal steam sterilization, visual inspection and sampling and labelling and 
packaging 
Major  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  of  vial  2  have  been  validated  and it  has  been  demonstrated  that 
the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible 
manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process. 
An overview of the reconstitution process for the preparation of the radiolabelled imaging product by the end 
user (hospital radiopharmacy) has also been provided. An explanation of the rationale of the procedure and 
the detailed description of the radiolabelling procedure is included in the SmPC.

The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines.  
Batch analysis results are provided for three production scale batches of vial 1 and vial 2 confirming the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through traditional 
final product release testing.

In case of vial 1, stability data of three commercial scale batches  stored under long term conditions for up 
12 months at 5 ºC and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH according to the 
ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are identical to those proposed for marketing 
and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for appearance of the freeze dried cake, container closure integrity, appearance of the 
reconstituted solution, reconstitution time, sub-visible particles, residual moisture, edotreotide assay, gentisic

substances, 
During long term stability studies, the physical characteristics of the product maintained their quality over the 
tested  period  with  no  deterioration  recorded  when  the  finished  product  was  stored  at  5  ±  3°C.  During  the 
accelerated  stability  studies,  all  tested  parameters  were  within  the  acceptance  criteria  of  the  shelf-life 
specification with good physical characteristics of the finished product over the studied period for the first two 
batches  after  6  months  of  storage.  In  addition,  one  batch  was  exposed  to  light  as  defined  in  the  ICH 
Guideline  on  Photostability  Testing  of  New  Drug  Substances  and  Products.  Based  on  the  study  results  the 
finished product should be kept in the original package in order to be protected from light. 
For  vial  2,  stability  data  of  three  commercial  scale  batches  stored  under  long  term  conditions  for  up  18 
months  at 5 ºC and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH, according to the 
ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are identical to those proposed for marketing 
and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples  were  tested  for  appearance,  sub-visible  particles,  pH,  formic  acid  quantification  and  sterility.  The 
analytical procedures used are stability indicating.  
During  long  term  stability  studies,  the  physico-chemical  parameters  for  all  batches  of  vial  2  reaction  buffer 
were  within  the  shelf-life  specification  at  all  testing  points  Vial  2  also  showed good  stability  when  stored  at 
accelerated conditions. No deterioration in physico-chemical characteristics or out of specification results was 
observed. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New 
Drug  Substances  and  Products.  No  changes  were  observed.  Therefore  it  was  concluded  that  the  vial  2 
reaction buffer is photostable.  
An  in-use  stability  study  was  also  performed  for  the  reconstituted  radiolabelled  finished  product.  The  study 
was  performed  with  two  batches  of  vial  1  and  two  batches  of  vial  2.  The  preparation  of  the  radiolabelled 
imaging product was performed according to the procedure used in the hospital by the end user as described 
Assessment report

in the SmPC. The in-use stability study demonstrated that the radiolabelled imaging finished product is stable 
for the proposed in-use shelf-life of 4 hours when kept at room temperature. 
Considering that both vial 1 and vial 2 will be stored in the same secondary packaging and the stability profile 
of  vial  1  is  more  restrictive,  the  shelf  life  and  storage  conditions  of  vial  2  are  adapted  to  those  of  vial  1. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 12 months when stored in a refrigerator (2-8°C) 
and stored in the original package in order to be protected from light as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are 
acceptable. After radiolabelling the product should be used within 4 hours when stored below 25°C. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The active substance is a peptide with 8 amino acids and a covalently 
bound chelator (DOTA). The finished product is a kit for radiopharmaceutical preparation. As all kits for 
radiopharmaceutical preparation, it is not intended for direct administration to the patient. Instead, it must 
be radiolabelled immediately before use with a gallium (68Ga) chloride solution to generate a gallium (68Ga) 
edotreotide injection, which is the product which is injected to the patient. The results of tests carried out 
indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the 
conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no impact 
on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product. These will be addressed in the post-authorisation phase. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In  the  context  of  the  obligation  of  the  MAHs  to  take  due  account  of  technical  and  scientific  progress,  the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
-  To  complete  the  validation  of  the  HPLC  method  proposed  for  the  determination  of  edotreotide  content 
(assay) and update the ASMF accordingly before the commercialisation of the finished product.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The non-clinical sections of the dossier have been compiled from published literature. No new non-clinical 
data has been presented in this submission.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro binding studies in human cells (Reubi 200019, Deshmukh 2005) 
Edotreotide and other somatostatin analogues affinity for somatostatin receptor was evaluated in vitro using 
cell lines transfected with the five human somatostatin receptor subtypes (sstr1-sstr5). Results are shown in 
Table 1. In this study it was shown that the affinity as IC50 of (68Ga) edotreotide for sstr2 (2.5 nM) is 
comparable with that of endogenous somatostatin SS-28 (2.7 nM) and other peptides, whereas IC50 for 
111In-DTPA0-Octreotide (Octreoscan) was about 10-fold lower (22 nM). Binding affinity was higher when 
either edotreotide or DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate is labelled with gallium compared to the same peptides in the 
unlabelled form or labelled with yttrium, showing that the coordination geometry of the radiometal complex 
has a significant influence on affinity profiles.  
Edotreotide or Ga-edotreotide did not show affinity for the human sst 1 and sst 4 receptors, while affinity for 
human sst 3 and sst 5 receptors was 30 to 250 times lower than the affinity for sst 2 receptor.

The affinity of 125I-Tyr3-octreotide was assessed using murine AtT20 pituitary tumour cell membrane 
preparations as a source of sstr2. Binding of 125I-Tyr3-octreotide was temperature dependent and inhibited by 
pertussis toxin. In table 2.1.2 it is shown the amount of several unlabelled octreotide derivatives required to

In vitro binding study in monkey brain (Velikyan 201222) 
The sstr2 binding affinity of 68Ga-labelled edotreotide and DOTA0-Tyr3-octreotate was investigated in an in 
vitro autoradiography binding assay with Rhesus monkey brain frozen sections. The specificity of the binding 
to SSTR expressing tissue was confirmed by blocking experiments using excess of octreotide. All ligands 
visualized the cerebral cortex in the monkey brain, with much lower binding in the central structures, white 
matter or cerebellum. The nonspecific binding, as determined by the addition of a high concentration 
octreotide, was very low. In this study both compounds showed a very high selectivity in binding the sstr 2 
subtype receptor (Figure 2). The individual IC50 values for edotreotide were 18.3 and 29.5 nM respectively 
for monkey 1 and 2.

A number of in vivo pharmacology studies in mice and rats using edotreotide labelled with different 
radionuclides (68Ga, 111In, 90Y, 177Lu) indicate that edotreotide is taken up by sstr2-expressing tumour tissues, 
as well as by high sstr2-expressing tissues or organs. 
Biodistribution study of (68Ga) edotreotide in mice (Muzio 2015) 
Female nude mice bearing AR42J rat pancreatic tumour were administered with 0.3 mCi of the radiolabelled 
(68Ga) edotreotide for biodistribution and PET analysis. Tumour uptake was confirmed at all time points 
analyzed. Tumour to kidney ratio was 0.36-0.42 for all time points, whereas tumour to blood ratio was 2.46, 
5.61, 13.19 and 25.70 at 30 min, 1 h, 2 h and 4 h, respectively. The specificity of the uptake of edotreotide 
was confirmed by PET scan performed 45 minutes after an IV injection of unlabelled somatostatin analogue, 
showing a significant decrease in the uptake of (68Ga)-edotreotide. 
Therapeutic effect of (90Y) edotreotide in sstr2-expressing tumours (Stolz 1998) 
A study was conducted to evaluate the therapeutic effect of (90Y) edotreotide in Lewis rats bearing the 
somatostatin receptor-positive rat pancreatic tumour CA20948. In vivo, (90Y) edotreotide distributed rapidly 
to the sst 2 expressing CA20948 rat pancreatic tumour, with a tumour-to-blood ratio of 49.15 at 24 h post 
injection. A single IV administration of 10 mCi/kg resulted in a complete remission of the tumours in five out 
of seven animals. No regrowth of the tumours occurred 8 months post injection. Control animals that were 
treated with 30 mg/kg of unlabelled edotreotide had to be sacrificed 10 days post injection due to excessive 
growth or necrotic areas on the tumour surface. Upon re-inoculation of tumour cells into those rats that had 
shown complete remission, the tumours disappeared after 3–4 weeks of moderate growth without any further 
treatment. 
177Lu-edotreotide for somatostatin receptor-targeted radionuclide therapy (de Jong 2001) 
In this study it was shown that the cure rate depends on tumour size, with (177Lu) edotreotide resulting in 
40% cure of small rat pancreatic tumours (CA20948) after a single IV administration of 277.5 MBq and 60% 
cure after 2 repeated doses. In addition, a 100% cure rate was achieved in the groups of rats bearing small 
(<1 cm2) CA20948 tumors after 2 doses of 277.5 MBq or after a single dose of 555 MBq.

Biodistribution of (68Ga) edotreotide and (68Ga) DOTA0-Tyr3-octreotate in healthy rats (Velikyan 2012) 
Dynamic PET scanning was performed after IV administration as a bolus of 8.96±1.0 MBq/animal of (68Ga) 
edotreotide and (68Ga) DOTA0-Tyr3-octreotate in male Sprague Dawley rats. Both somatostatin analogues 
showed a rapid uptake in the kidneys and outflow of activity in the first 15 minutes (Figure 3). 
Figure 3: 
PET time activity curves for kidneys after administration of (68Ga) edotreotide and 
(68Ga) DOTA0-Tyr3-octreotate to rats. Triangles represent uptake in kidneys of 
(68Ga) edotreotide (n=2), and circles of (68Ga) DOTA0-Tyr3-octreotate (n=1). 
Vertical dotted line is at 75 min, the time chosen for the organ distribution study. 
A second group of animals was also used for analysis of organ biodistribution. The time for sacrifice for this 
study was chosen to be 75 min because in the time activity curves for the uptake in the kidneys steady state 
was not obtained until over 1 h. Smaller organs like the adrenals and pancreas expressing sstrs 
physiologically showed high uptake of both tracers in the organ distribution studies, but could not be 
distinguished in the PET images due to the high uptake in kidneys and urinary bladder in the case of 
adrenals. Figure 4 shows the SUV (standardized uptake values) calculated for individual organs.  
The average radioactivity concentration in blood was low, showing fast clearance from blood circulation. 
Organs without physiological expression of sstrs (heart, lung, liver, spleen, intestine, bone, muscle) had low 
uptake of somatostatin analogues. 
The organ distribution of radioactivity in the form of buffered and formulated 68GaCl 3 was also studied in 
order to evaluate the possible contribution of free 68Ga. The uptake of the radioactivity was the highest in the 
blood and evenly distributed in most of the organs. The accumulation of 68GaCl 3 in the heart, lung, liver and 
spleen was considerably higher as compared to that of peptide tracers.

Biodistribution of (213Bi) edotreotide in healthy rats (Norenberg 2006) 
Biodistribution of edotreotide labelled with the α-emitter 213Bi was assessed in rats. The biodistribution data 
showed receptor specificity to somatostatin receptor–expressing tissues when a blocking dose of edotreotide 
was coadministered with the (213Bi) edotreotide. The somatostatin receptor–positive organs, pancreas, 
adrenals, stomach, and pituitary showed significantly decreased uptake of (213Bi) edotreotide following a 
blocking dose of edotreotide. No significant difference was seen in the receptor-negative organs: blood, liver, 
spleen, muscle, bone, kidneys, testis, and blood. 
Biodistribution of (68Ga) edotreotide in AR42J tumour-bearing mice (Muzio 2015) 
Female nude mice were inoculated with AR42J rat pancreatic tumour cells. AR42J tumour model has 
exclusive expression of the sst 2 receptor subtype and there is a high degree of sequence homology between 
human and rat sstr2. Results are shown in Table 3 and Table 4.

Biodistribution of 67Ga-, 90Y- and 111In-labelled edotreotide in AR42J tumour-bearing mice and comparison 
with Octreoscan (Froidevaux 200229) 
Edotreotide labelled with 90Y, 111In or 67Ga was administered to tumour-bearing nude mice (AR42J rat 
pancreatic cell line) and its biodistribution was compared to that of (111In) DTPA0-octreotide (Octreoscan) 4 
hours after injection. Labelled edotreotide showed a more favourable biodistribution compared to (111In) 
octreotide, with higher tumour uptake, faster blood clearance and lower kidney retention, as well as higher 
uptake in sstr2-positive tissues such as adrenals, pancreas and tumour. 
Biodistribution of (111In) edotreotide in AR42J tumour-bearing rats (Lin 200630) 
Biodistribution and tumour uptake ratio after IV administration of (111In) DTPA0-octreotide and (111In) 
edotreotide were compared in Lewis male rats bearing the AR42J rat pancreatic tumour. At 4 hours after 
administration of 3.7 MBq of the radiolabelled product, the highest radioactivity was observed in tumour and 
kidney for both radiolabelled analogues, with a higher activity in animals treated with (111In) edotreotide (see 
Table 6).

Excretion 
(68Ga) DOTA conjugated peptides are known to be excreted almost entirely through the kidneys (European 
Association of Nuclear Medicine EANM guideline: Virgolini 2010). Biodistribution studies in CA20948 tumour 
bearing animals treated with (90Y) edotreotide (de Jong 199731) showed that >80% of the injected 
radioactivity is excreted within 24 hours in the urine, of which 95.6±3.4% is still non-metabolized (90Y) 
edotreotide.

Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeat dose toxicity studies with (68Ga) edotreotide were not submitted (see non-clinical discussion). 
Genotoxicity 
Genotoxicity studies with (68Ga) edotreotide were not submitted. 
Genotoxicity studies with DOTA0-Tyr3-octreotate, a well-known somatostatin analogue belonging to the 
same chemical class as edotreotide, are available from the literature and indicate that the unlabelled peptide 
has no influence in the induction of cytogenetic damage, using an in vitro micronucleous assay with human 
peripheral lymphocites (Suzuki 2007). 
Genotoxicity test on the novel excipient 1,10-phenanthroline 
In published in vitro genotoxicity tests, 1,10-phenanthroline has been shown to be non-mutagenic in 
bacterial reverse mutation assay conducted in Salmonella typhimurium (strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, 
TA1537), with and without metabolic activation. However, in a mouse lymphoma assay a positive result was 
observed suggesting that 1,10-phenanthroline is a potential mammalian cell mutagen. The lowest effective 
dose was calculated to be 0.75 µg/mL (4.2 µM) without metabolic activation and 25 µg/mL (139 µM) with

Other toxicity studies 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
Studies to evaluate reproductive toxicity of (68Ga) edotreotide were not submitted (see non-clinical 
discussion). 
General toxicity of novel excipient 1,10-phenanthroline 
The drug product contains 1,10-phenanthroline, a novel excipient. A toxicological evaluation and risk 
assessment of 1,10-phenanthroline was performed by the Applicant on the basis of studies published in the 
literature. The threshold of toxicological concern (TCC) approach was also applied (Kroes 200534). 
Acute toxicity studies in mice showed that 1,10-phenanthroline doses up to 300 mg/kg (corresponding to a 
human equivalent dose HED of 24 mg/kg, 260000 times higher than the foreseen human IV dose) 
administered by intraperitoneal route induced no mortality at 24, 72 or 168 hours post dose, while a dose of 
450 mg/kg induced 100% mortality at 24 hours (McCann 201235). No behavioural or body weight changes or 
changes in aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase levels were noted in treated animals. In 
addition, no effects were observed after daily treatment of mice with 1,10-phenanthroline for 5 consecutive 
days by IP route at 45 mg/kg (corresponding to an HED of 3.7 mg/kg, 40000 times the foreseen human IV 
dose). 
The Permitted Daily Exposure (PDE) estimated for 1,10-phenathroline was evaluated based on the results of 
a reproductive toxicity study reported in literature, performed on pregnant CF-1 albino mice, after 
intraperitoneal administration (Chang et al., 1977). In this study the Lowest Observed Effect Level (LOAEL) 
was 30 mg/kg/day. For a more conservative estimation of the PDE, all adjustment factors suggested by the 
guideline to account for various uncertainties and to allow the extrapolation to a reliable no-effect level, were 
set at their maximum level: 
PDE = (30 mg/kg/day x 50 kg)/(12 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10) = 12.5 μg/day 
The value calculated, 12.5 μg/day, is highly conservative and represents the dose that is unlikely to cause an 
adverse effect if an individual is exposed at or below this dose every day for a lifetime. This dose is more 
than 2-fold higher than the maximum 1,10-phenanthroline amount that will be administered in patients as a 
single dose. 
The PDE was also estimated based on a repeated dose toxicity study in mice reported in literature (McCann 
et al.,2012), in which the NOEL was found to be 45 mg/kg/day. Also in this case, all adjustment factors were 
set at their maximum level and the PDE value was calculated as follows, in line with the Guideline on setting 
health based exposure limits for use in risk identification in the manufacture of different medicinal products in 
shared facilities (EMA/CHMP/CVMP/SWP/169430/2012) and ICH guideline Q3C(R5): 
PDE = (NOEL x Weight Adjustment) / (F1 x F2 x F3 x F4 x F5)

F1 = factor (values between 2 and 12) to account for extrapolation between species 
F2 = factor of 10 to account for variability between individuals 
F3 = factor 10 to account for repeat-dose toxicity studies of short duration, i.e., less than 4- weeks 
F4 = factor (1-10) that may be applied in cases of severe toxicity, e.g. non-genotoxic carcinogenicity, 
neurotoxicity or teratogenicity

LOEL is available, a factor of up to 10 could be used depending on the severity of the toxicity. 
Using the NOEL observed in the repeated dose toxicity study (45 mg/kg) and setting all adjustment factors at 
their maximum level for a more conservative estimation of the PDE:

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant provided an experimental LogKow value of -2.93 ± 0.37 that is well below the cut-off of 4.5, 
limit by the EMA guideline. The value was based on the published data for 68Ga-edotreotide.  
Additionally, following the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human 
Use  (Doc.  Ref.  EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00  corr  1*,  01  June  2006),  the  environmental  risk  assessment  of 
medicinal products containing natural substances, including peptides (i.e. edotreotide) can be waived, as they 
do not pose significant impact on the environment.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The applicant submitted published literature to present non-clinical data for edotreotide. In vitro and in vitro 
studies showed that edotreotide and other somatostatin analogues bind to the sst2 receptor, commonly over-
expressed in GEP-NETs. In all studies, edotreotide is specifically taken up by sstr2 expressing tissues and 
organs, such as tumour tissue, pancreas and adrenals.  
Regarding pharmacokinetics, biodistribution data of edotreotide in normal rats and rodent tumour models 
using both therapeutic and diagnostic radionuclides was submitted. In all studies, edotreotide is specifically 
taken up by sstr2 expressing tissues and organs, such as tumour tissue, pancreas and adrenals. Edotreotide, 
is rapidly taken up by the kidneys and fast clearance from blood circulation is observed. In addition, a study 
was conducted with the commercial formulation of SomaKit TOC in mice inoculated with AR42J pancreatic 
tumour cells. In this study, dosimetry data show high uptake in kidney (renal elimination) and tumour.  
According to the literature, excretion appears to be mainly via the kidney, with relatively fast elimination 
kinetics and is excreted mostly as the intact parent compound. 
The applicant submitted published data results from two single toxicity studies. No major findings were 
reported. Non-clinical data did not reveal any special hazard for gallium (68Ga) edotreotide in humans.

The toxicity studies conducted with labelled or unlabelled edotreotide showed only minimal interstitial 
nephritis in animals treated with (213Bi) edotreotide. Radiation-induced nephritis is a known adverse effect of 
radiolabelled somatostatin analogues (Rolleman 2010). The study by Venturella 2015 is a GLP study 
conducted with unlabelled edotreotide formulation, including all the excipients and with the final pH of 
3.5±0.3, at a dose about 500 times higher than the planned (68Ga) edotreotide human dose. No signs of 
toxicity or treatment-related changes were observed. 
No repeat dose toxicity studies are considered necessary because repeated (68Ga) edotreotide administration 
for patient monitoring is unlikely to occur and the doses used in clinical practice are expected to be low and 
separated in time.  
No studies on fertility, embryology, mutagenicity or long-term carcinogenicity have been conducted or were 
identified in the literature on (68Ga) edotreotide. Carcinogenicity studies are not considered necessary. This is 
acceptable, considering the favourable safety profile of the compound, the clinical experience and that (68Ga) 
edotreotide will be given as a single low dose for diagnostic purposes only. 
Published data to evaluate reproductive toxicity of (68Ga) edotreotide have not been submitted. It is not 
known if the compound could cause foetal toxicity when administered to pregnant women, or if it could have 
any effect on reproductive capacity. Moreover, the risk of the radiation exposure in pregnancy should be 
taken into consideration. Therefore, (68Ga) edotreotide administration in pregnant women should be avoided, 
unless the potential benefit justifies the risk (see SmPC section 4.6). 
Safety pharmacology studies conducted with somatostatin analogue DOTATATE showed no treatment-related 
effects in central nervous system, cardiovascular or respiratory system. 
Local tolerance assessment resulted in mild to moderate inflammation signs in the perivascular region of 
some animals which can be attributed to the acidic pH of the solution. 
Although no genotoxicity data are available for edotreotide, other somatostatin analogues (DOTA0-Tyr3-
octreotate, lanreotide) have not shown evidence of genotoxicity. The justification of the Applicant for the lack 
of carcinogenicity and reprotoxicity studies is accepted.  
The Applicant has conducted a risk assessment of the novel excipient 1,10-phenanthroline. The amount of 
1,10-phenanthroline in each clinical dose is 5 µg/dose. Literature data (McCann 2012) has shown a lack of 
toxicity at doses (HED) much higher than the doses expected to be administered in patients (260000 times 
higher than the human dose in the single dose study or 40000 in the 5-day repeated dose study). In addition 
the Applicant has calculated the PDE of 1,10-phenanthroline assuming that the highest dose with no mortality 
of the literature data (McCann 2012) is the NOEL. The PDE value obtained with these data is 18.7 µg/day, 
which would be a dose that is unlikely to cause an adverse effect if an individual is exposed at or below this 
dose every day for a lifetime. The value is higher than the 1,10-phenanthroline dose expected in patients 
treated with SomaKit TOC (5 µg), which will be administered only once or few times during a lifetime.   
Regarding the novel excipient (1,10-phenanthroline), during the toxicity study conducted with the kit 
formulation of SomaKitTOC including 1,10-phenanthroline at a dose 400 fold higher than the human dose, no 
toxicity signs were observed. Genotoxicity studies on 1,10-phenanthroline available in the literature show 
negative results in bacterial mutation assay (Ames test), while in a mouse lymphoma assay an indication of 
possible genotoxicity was obtained at concentrations 750 times higher than the maximum 1,10-
phenanthroline blood concentration achievable in patients. However, even taking as reference the highest 
limits for genotoxic and carcinogenic impurities, the risk related to the trace amounts of 1,10-phenanthroline 
in SomaKit TOC formulation is considered negligible at the dose to be administered in patients: the exposure 
Assessment report  
EMA/734748/2016 
Page 36/104 
  
  
to 1,10-phenanthroline (5 µg/dose) is 24 fold lower than the acceptable daily intake for a genotoxic impurity 
(120 µg/day for exposures <1 month). However, with the low amounts administered to patients, the risk of 
1,10-phenanthroline is negligible even if it were genotoxic. Therefore, considering the absence of findings in 
the studies conducted with the kit formulation of SomaKit TOC including 1,10-phenanthroline and the 
estimated PDE value, the risk of 1,10-phenanthroline is negligible at the dose expected in patients treated 
with SomaKit TOC. 
Since the obtained value for Fpen is well below 0.01 μg/L threshold considered by the guideline for 
environmental testing, it is considered that edotrotide is unlikely to represent any relevant risk for the 
environment. Moreover, as endotrotide is a peptide, it is considered to unlikely result in a significant risk to 
the environment. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic, and toxicological characteristics of edotreotide have been well 
characterized in the literature. The non-clinical aspects are considered to be appropriately addressed.

Biodistribution 
After intravenous injection, 68Ga-edotreotide is rapidly cleared from the blood following bi-exponential arterial 
elimination of activity with two half-lives (2.0±0.3 min and 48±7 min). Please see figures below.

Figure 5:  
Time activity curves of 68Ga-edotreotide over the tumour and kidney 
Time-activity curves, measured over tumour (o) and over the right kidney (□), reveal very fast renal 
elimination of the tracer, whereas the tumour accumulated 68Ga-edotreotide up to 75 min after the injection, 
with 90% of the peak uptake at 38 min (patient 1) (Hofmann 2001 36) 
Figure 6: 
Time activity curves of 68Ga-edotreotide over the kidney, liver and lumbar spine 
Typical time-activity curves (patient 4) using 68Ga-edotreotide measured over kidney (Ο), liver (□) and the 
lumbar spine (Δ). There is rapid renal elimination with similarly low retention in all three regions as early as 
38 min p.i. (Hofmann 2001). 
No radioactive metabolites were detected within 4 hours in serum. Maximal tumour activity accumulation was 
reached 70 ± 20 min post injection and similar time courses of local SUVs were observed in the spleen. The 
time-activity curves obtained from the renal parenchyma showed an initial peak followed by a rapid decrease. 
Between 10 and 15 min p.i. the activity concentration was of the same order of magnitude as that observed 
in the liver. The ratio of the SUVs of kidney to spleen ranged from 0.13 to 0.5 at times >90 min p.i. The 
activity concentration of the bone marrow was at least 1 order of magnitude lower than that of the tumours. 
In all patients, thyroid and pineal gland, both adrenal glands were clearly delineated with positive contrast.

Activity levels in these organs remained almost constant after 90 min p.i., SUVs of these organs did not 
exceed a value of 2.5.  
The organ with the highest 68Ga-edotreotide uptake is the spleen (mean SUV2: 21.8 ± 2.2, N=3), followed 
by the kidneys (mean SUV2: 11.9 ± 3.1, N=3). The uptake in the liver, the pituitary, the thyroid gland and 
both adrenal gland is lower mean (SUV2 in liver=6.1 ± 1.4, in pituitary gland=1.4 ± 0.6). The highest SUVs 
were found at a plateau between 45 and 90 minutes with a maximum (mean SUV 38.1) 60 minutes post-
injection (Hofmann 2001, Kowalski 2003 and Boy 2011). The liver metastases of another patient did not 
show an increase of the SUVs during the whole examination (120 minutes). 
In the study of Boy et al., for each organ, SUVmax values demonstrated low within-patient variability with 
coefficients of variation between 25 and 48% (Boy 2011). Two of the 19 target regions, the uptake of which 
was measured on PET/CT, revealed significant gender differences: in the thyroid gland, SUVmax of male 
subjects exceeded that of female subjects by about 50% (female = 3.7 ± 1.6, male = 5.5 ± 2.4, p<0.001) 
and in the pancreatic head by about 25%, respectively (female = 5.5 ± 1.9, male = 6.9 ± 2.2, p<0.001). 
The SUVmax data were evaluated within a strict time window of 30–90 min post injection. The regional 
SUVmax values were comparable to those of the whole population with slightly different variation coefficients 
(e.g. in the subgroup, the uncinate process SUVmax was significantly different from that of all other 
pancreatic tissues including pancreas tail region). Moreover, in this subgroup, gender differences appeared to 
be limited to the thyroid (female = 3.7 ± 1.6 range = 1.1 – 7.6, male = 5.4 ± 2.6 range = 2.6 – 14.3, 
p<0.001), underlying thyroid pathology not being ruled out. 
Overall, in the study of Boy et al. the 68Ga-edotreotide SUVmax has been shown to be an age-independent 
and predominantly gender-independent parameter of normal adult human tissues (Boy 2011). 68Ga-
edotreotide uptake showed a correlation with in vitro SSTR2 but not with SSTR5 expression. Concordantly 
with the results of Boy et al. in 2011, there is a correlation between 68Ga-edotreotide uptake on PET 
quantified by calculation of standardised uptake values (SUV) and expression of SSTR2 proven by 
immunohistochemistry (Miederer 200937, Müssig 201038).  
The frequent physiological uptake of 68Ga-edotreotide by the pancreas uncinate process, which may be 
caused by an accumulation of pancreatic polypeptide-containing cells expressing SSTR, was confirmed by 
Jacobsson et al.39. As a consequence for image interpretation, if there is a normal finding on concomitant 
diagnostic CT, this uptake should be regarded as physiological (Al-Ibraheem 201140, Jacobsson 201241). 
Kroiss et al. proposed a cut-off SUV of 17.1 to distinguish physiologic 68Ga-edotreotide uptake by uncinate 
process from tumour (Kroiss 201342).

The highest uptake was measured of the pancreas and the lowest in a patient with a medullary thyroid 
carcinoma (MEN-2). The analysis shows that k1 had the greatest impact on the global SUV, followed by Vb 
and k3. It was concluded that 68Ga-edotreotide uptake in NET is mainly dependent on k1 (receptor binding) 
and Vb (fractional blood volume) with low cellular externalisation (k4).  
Table  10:  Evaluation  of  the  pharmacokinetics  of  68Ga-edetreotide  in  patients  with  metastatic 
neuroendocrine tumours scheduled for 90Y-edotreotide therapy (Koukouraki 2006a43) 
In Velikyan et al.44, the net uptake rate (Ki) was calculated both using nonlinear regression of an irreversible 
2-tissue-compartment model and using the Patlak method, which is a linearization of this model, for 3 most 
active lesions per patient. After intravenous administration, the 68Ga-edotreotide was rapidly cleared from the 
blood. The radioactivity in the blood decreased to less than 4.7% of the peak level 68Ga-edotreotide, within 
45 min of the dynamic acquisition and to 2.0% at 195 min after administration. After 50 min, the 
accumulation of 68Ga-edotreotide in all organs reached a plateau. The tumour accumulation for each patient 
was represented by the lesion with the highest radioactivity uptake. 68Ga-edotreotide tumour uptake in all 
patients except one continually increased over time. 
Dosimetry 
The administration of 100-200 MBq of 68Ga-edotreotide leads approximately to a total effective dose of 2.0-
4.0 mSv for men and 2.3-4.6 mSv for women (Sandström 201345, Hartmann 200946). 
The critical organ receiving the highest absorbed dose from 68Ga-edotreotide is the urinary bladder wall, 
spleen and kidney (0.119±0.058 mGy/MBq, 0.108±0.065 mGy/MBq and 0.082±0.020 mGy/MBq 
respectively) (Sandström 2013). Twofold higher absorbed doses by spleen any kidney has been observed by 
Hartmann et al. (Hartmann 2009): spleen 0.24 mGy/MBq, kidney 0.22 mGy/MBq, using a scanning protocol 
with sparser sampling requiring extrapolation over a larger fraction of the total decay of the tracer than in the 
study of Sandström et al. (Sandström 2013) (Table 11, Table 12, Table 13).

In the same study the urine was collected and 15.6% (SD 9.2) of 68Ga-edotreotide was excreted into the 
urine during the first 4 h after injection. The Ki based on Patlak analysis correlated well with Ki based on 
compartment modelling. The relation between SUV and Ki was not linear; instead, SUVs no longer increased 
for Ki values larger than 0.2 mL/cm3/min. 
Gallium-68 decays with a half-life of 68 min to stable zinc-68, 89% through positron emission with a mean 
energy of 836 keV followed by photonic annihilation radiations of 511 keV (178%), 10% through orbital 
electron capture (X-ray or Auger emissions), and 3% through 13 gamma transitions from 5 excited levels.

The effective dose resulting from the administration of an activity of 200 MBq to an adult weighing 70 kg is 
about 4.2 mSv. 
For an administered activity of 200 MBq the typical radiation dose to the critical organs, which are the urinary 
bladder wall, the spleen, the kidneys and the adrenals, are about 24, 22, 16 and 15 mGy, respectively. 
Elimination 
After intravenous injection, 68Ga-edotreotide is rapidly cleared from the blood following bi-exponential arterial 
elimination of activity with two half-lives (2.0±0.3 min and 48±7 min). The radioactivity in the blood 
decreased to less than 4.7% of the peak level 68Ga-edotreotide, within 45 min of the dynamic acquisition and 
to 2.0% at 195 min after administration. 
The majority of somatostatin analogue peptides are excreted as intact compound via the renal system. 
Approximately 16% of 68Ga-edotreotide activity is removed from the body in the urine within 2 to 4 hours 
(Sandström 2013, Velikyan 2014).

Although gender differences were evident within the thyroid and the pancreatic head, the organ 68Ga-
edotreotide uptake has been shown to be age-independent and gender-independent parameter of normal 
adult human tissues. 
Organ with the highest gallium (68Ga) edotreotide uptake is the spleen, followed by the kidneys. The uptake 
in the liver, the pituitary, the thyroid gland and both adrenal gland is lower. Fifty minutes after intravenous 
administration of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide, its accumulation in all organs shows plateauing.  
Approximately 16% of 68Ga-edotreotide activity is removed from the body in the urine during the first 4 
hours. No degradation products of the radiopeptide were found in the serum within 4 hours after intravenous 
injection of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide. 
Metabolism 
The metabolism of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide was studied in 2001 by Hofmann et al. (Hofmann 200147). In 
humans treated IV with (68Ga) edotreotide, no radioactive metabolites were detected in serum 4 hours after 
administration. These results are in line with urine excretion data obtained in non-clinical biodistribution 
studies (de Jong 199748), showing that >80% of the injected radiolabelled edotreotide is excreted within 24 
hours in the urine, mostly as intact compound (see section 3.5).

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Gallium (68Ga) edotreotide is radiopharmaceutical composed of edotreotide, a somatostatin analogue, 
designed for PET imaging of somatostatin receptors in GEP-NET patients.   
Mechanism of action 
The company has provided with published data showing in vitro the affinity profile to human sstr of gallium 
(68Ga) edotreotide, Octreoscan and some other somatostatin radiotracers. The profile resulted to be similar

for gallium (68Ga) DOTATOC and Octreoscan, mostly to sstr2 and sstr5; however, the affinity of the former 
was nine-fold higher in sstr2 and three-fold higher in sstr5 (Table 15).  
The somatostatin agonist gallium (68Ga) edotreotide is aDOTA-conjugated analogue of somatostatin with high 
affinity to somatostatin receptor subtype2 (SSTR2). In normal human tissues, gallium (68Ga) edotreotide 
uptake on PET imaging is related to the expression of SSTR2 exclusively at the level of mRNA (Boy et al 
201149).

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
The uptake and distribution of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide has been analyzed in patients with GEP-NETs in the 
study of Velikyan et al. 201050 aimed to evaluate the impact of peptide mass on the quantitative values of 
binding of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide and on the image contrast. Six patients with GEP-NET underwent three 
sequential PET/CT examinations with gallium (68Ga) edotreotide during the same day applied a3-h interval 
between the examinations (injected radioactivity:15–80 MBq; injected edotreotide: 1.54±0.58 μg and 
4.95±0.7 μg, respectively, for the first and second/third administration). Prior to the second and third 
injections, 50 μg and 250 or 500 μg of octreotide were injected. The specific activity for the first injection was 
35 ± 15 MBq/nmol, for the second injection was 0.93±0.07MBq/nmol and for the third injection was 0.25 
MBq/nmol (250 μg of octreotide) and 0.14±0.03 MBq/nmol (500 μg of octreotide). A static whole-body 2D 
PET/CT image was obtained at 10 min postinjection of the radiopharmaceutical.  
The authors conclude that the gallium (68Ga) edotreotide uptake and image contrast in both tumours and 
normal organs depends on the total amount of administered peptide (both labelled and unlabelled).  The 
pattern of the tumoural uptake for the three sequential tracer administrations was qualitatively similar in-
between patients except for one patient. However, uptake increased versus baseline in almost all tumours 
or remained constant in the 50-μg pretreated scan, and thereafter decreased with the higher doses. An 
expected individual variability in tumour tracer accumulation was found, indicating significant differences in 
sst receptor density expression. There was that a large variation was also found in normal tissues. One

explanation might be that apparent healthy tissues also contained varying amounts of micrometastases not 
seen in the PET images. 
The lesion-to-liver ratio increased in four of five patients in which liver values were available from the 
baseline to the 50-μg pretreated scan. The average increase was 42% (range:13–108%) and the uptake 
increased in the metastases but decreased in the liver and spleen. The baseline lesion-to-liver ratio increased 
in four of five patients with the higher doses (average: 88%; range:1–223%). 
The authors discuss that at the dose of 50 μg a blocking effect does not occurred in tumour but in normal 
tissues; so did for the higher amounts of the peptide both in the tumour tissue and in normal tissues (liver 
and spleen).  They acknowledge that since the span of the peptide amount is rather wide, one cannot exclude 
the possibility that a better tumour-to-background contrast can be achieved at lower octreotide amounts. 
The previous splenectomy should be considered as a relevant factor when reporting the outcome of SSTR 
targeted diagnostics and therapies since it leads to higher  g a l l i u m   ( 68Ga)   edotreotide uptake in tumour 
lesions, adrenal and kidney tissue(Kratochwil 201351).  These authors studied 22 pancreatic NET patients 
(eleven patients with and eleven patients without splenectomy). Imaging was started 60±10 minutes 
after I.V. injection of 116 to 164 MBq of 68Ga– edotreotide.

The absence of relevant in vivo saturation SSTR2 was proven in tumour lesions. Inversely, in normal tissue 
(liver, spleen) a limited SSTR2 capacity was confirmed (Velikyan2010, Ezziddin 201252, Giesel 201353, 
Sabet201354). 
•  Pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products or substances 
No in vivo pharmacodynamics drug-drug interaction studies performed with a number of drugs belonging to 
classes that may be frequently used by the intended population have been provided.   
Given the lack of interaction studies, the recommendation to perform imaging with gallium (68Ga) 
edotreotide at the end of therapeutic interval with unlabelled somatostatin analogues seems to be an 
acceptable compromise.

Somatostatin and its analogues are probably competing to bind to the same somatostatin receptors. 
Therefore, when treating patients with somatostatin analogues, it is preferable to perform imaging 
with gallium (68Ga) edotreotide the day(s) preceding the next administration of a somatostatin 
analogue.  
A long-term exposure to endogenous hypercortisolism may down-regulate somatostatin receptor 
expression and negatively influence the results of somatostatin receptor imaging with gallium (68Ga) 
edotreotide. In patients with Cushing syndrome, the normalisation of hypercortisolism should be 
considered before performing PET with SomaKit TOC. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The PK assessment is based on published studies published in scientific journals.  
After intravenous injection, gallium (68Ga) edotreotide is rapidly cleared from the blood following bi-
exponential elimination of activity with half-lives of 2.0 ± 0.3 min and 48 ± 7 min respectively. The 
radioactivity in the blood decreased to less than 4.7% of the peak level gallium (68Ga) edotreotide, within 45 
min of the dynamic acquisition and to 2.0% at 195 min after administration. The organ with the highest 
physiological uptake of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide is the spleen, followed by the kidneys. The uptake in the 
liver and in the pituitary, thyroid and adrenal glands is lower. High physiological uptake of gallium (68Ga) 
edotreotide by the pancreas uncinate process can also be observed. About 50 minutes after intravenous 
administration, gallium (68Ga) edotreotide accumulation shows plateauing in all organs. 
The organ uptake has been shown to be age-independent in normal adult human tissues and also 
predominantly gender-independent (except for the thyroid and head of pancreas). 
No radioactive metabolites were detected in serum within 4 hours after intravenous injection of gallium 
(68Ga) edotreotide. 
Approximately 16% of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide activity is removed from the body in the urine within 2 to 4 
hours. The peptide is excreted via kidneys as intact compound. 
Given that the elimination rate is substantially slower than the physical half-life of 68Ga (68 min), the 
biological half-life will have little impact on the effective half-life of the product which then would be expected 
to be somewhat less than 68 minutes. 
Somatostatin and its analogues may compete to bind to the same somatostatin receptors. The company’s 
recommendation to withdraw unlabelled somatostatin analogues therapy prior to gallium (68Ga) edotreotide 
scan has been justified. 
There is no data presented on renal and hepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics in patients with renal or 
hepatic impairment has not been characterized. The safety and efficacy of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide have 
not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment (see section 4.2 and 5.2 of the SmPC). Severe 
renal or hepatic impairment might theoretically lead to increased bioavailability of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide, 
however, no data on eventual impact on diagnostic performance are available. This question will be 
implemented into risk management plan for SomaKit TOC as “missing information” in the RMP and will be a 
subject of post-marketing pharmacovigilance activities. 
For the elderly population, no special dosage regimen for elderly patients is required. 
For information on the use in paediatric population, see section 4.2 of the SmPC.

At the chemical concentrations used for diagnostic examinations, gallium (68Ga) edotreotide does not appear 
to have any clinically relevant pharmacodynamic effect. 
Edotreotide is a somatostatin analogue. Somatostatin is a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, 
but also a hormone which binds to cells of neuroendocrine origin and inhibits the release of growth hormone, 
insulin, glucagon, and gastrin. There is no data if the intravenous administration of edotreotide produces 
variation of serum gastrin and serum glucagon levels. 
Interpretation of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide images and limitations of use. 
PET images with gallium (68Ga) edotreotide reflect the presence of somatostatin receptors in the tissues. 
The organs with high physiological uptake of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide include spleen, kidneys, liver, 
pituitary gland, thyroid gland and adrenals. High physiological uptake of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide by the 
pancreas uncinate process can also be observed. PET findings interpretation errors have been included as an 
important potential risk. 
In GEP-NET, a more intense gallium (68Ga) edotreotide uptake than normal background is a consistent 
finding. However, lesions of GEP-NET not expressing sufficient density of somatostatin receptors cannot be 
visualised with gallium (68Ga) edotreotide. PET images with gallium (68Ga) edotreotide should be interpreted 
visually, and semi-quantitative measurement of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide uptake should not be used for 
clinical interpretation of images. 
Data supporting efficacy of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide for predicting and monitoring of therapeutic response 
to peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) in histologically confirmed metastatic NET are limited (see 
section 5.1). 
The applicant recommends normalising hypercortisolism in patients with ectopic Cushing’s syndrome before 
performing PET with gallium (68Ga) edotreotide based on the results of Davi et al. 201555 showing that long-
term exposure to hypercortisolism may downregulate SSTR expression and negatively influence the results of 
gallium (68Ga) edotreotide scan. Hypercortisolism is common for ectopic Cushing's syndrome (caused by 
tumors that secrete ACTH outside the pituitary or adrenal glands) and for other causes of Cushing’s 
syndrome (such as oversecretion of ACTH by the pituitary gland, a tumor of the adrenal gland, or long-term 
administration of corticosteroid drugs commonly used to treat conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and 
asthma). In case of Cushing syndrome, a long-term exposure to endogenous hypercortisolism may down 
regulate somatostatin receptor expression and negatively influence the results of somatostatin receptor 
imaging with gallium (68Ga) edotreotide. Thus, in patients with GEP-NET and Cushing syndrome, 
normalisation of hypercortisolism should be suggested before performing PET with gallium (68Ga) edotreotide. 
An increased uptake of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide is not specific for GEP-NET. Positive results require 
evaluating the possibility that another disease, characterised by high local somatostatin receptor 
concentrations, may be present. As an example, an increase in somatostatin receptor density can also occur 
in the following pathological conditions: subacute inflammations (areas of lymphocyte concentrations), 
thyroid diseases (e.g. thyroid autonomy and Hashimoto’s disease), tumours of the pituitary gland, neoplasms 
of the lungs (small-cell carcinoma), meningiomas, mammary carcinomas, lympho-proliferative disease (e.g. 
Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin lymphomas) and tumours arising from tissue embryologically derived

from the neural crest (e.g. paragangliomas, medullary thyroid carcinomas, neuroblastomas, 
pheochromocytomas). 
Splenectomy should also be considered as a relevant factor when reporting the outcome of somatostatin 
receptor targeted diagnostics. 
No studies on PK intereaction or using human biomaterials were performed. This is acceptable as no specific 
interactions are foreseen with of medicines or biomaterials. 
Concomitant use of somatostatin analogues 
The Octreoscan SmpC and the EANM guideline in force for gallium (68Ga) labelled somatostatin analogues 
recommends temporal withdrawal of unlabelled octreotide treatment based on empirical grounds. In the 
study of Velikyan et al. 2010 in GEP-NETs gallium (68Ga) edotreotide scan preceded of administration of 50μg 
of unlabelled octreotide had better tumour-to-background contrast than baseline scan and 250-μg or 500-
μgpretreated scan. It is preferable to perform imaging with gallium (68Ga) edotreotide the day(s) before the 
next administration of somatostatin analogue. See section 4.5 of the SmPC.  
The company has discussed potential in vivo pharmacodynamic drug-drug interactions with a number of 
drugs, apart from somatostatin analogues and glucocorticoids, belonging to classes that may be frequently 
used by the intended population. According  to  “Neuroendocrine  gastro-entero-pancreatic  tumours:  ESMO 
Clinical  Practice Guidelines  for  diagnosis,  treatment  and  follow-up”  (Oberg  et al.  2012),  in  addition  to 
SST analogues, the following treatments may be also recommended in GEP-NET patients: 
interferon alpha 
• 
•  mTOR-inhibitor (everolimus) 
• 
• 
• 
• 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors, sunitinib and pazopanib, 
streptozotocin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/doxorubicin with objective temozolomide-based chemotherapy 
cisplatinum/etoposide 
temozolomide  alone  or  in  combination  with  capecitabine ± bevacizumab  5-FU  i.v.  or capecitabine 
orally combined with oxaliplatin or irinotecan 
•  Somatostatin analogue based Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT) 
For these medicines, except in the case of PRRT, no data supporting eventual in vivo drug-drug interaction 
with gallium (68Ga) edotreotide are available. Previous PRRT does not negatively influence the efficacy of 
gallium (68Ga) edotreotide (Velikyan 2010, Giesel 2013, Sabet 2013). 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
At the chemical concentrations used for diagnostic examinations, gallium (68Ga) edotreotide does not appear 
to have any clinically relevant pharmacodynamic effect. The clinical pharmacology is considered well 
characterised in the literature. The clinical pharmacology aspects are considered to be appropriately 
addressed.

The time window for 68Ga imaging acquisition is relatively short, which is in line with the radio-nucleide's half-
life of 68 min. After administration, there is a rapid accumulation of activity in tumours (80% within 30 min), 
followed by a rapid renal clearance, which together with low activity concentration in tissues with low or no 
expression of somatostatin receptor (SSTR) contributes to the fast tumour contrast enhancement obtained 
with gallium (68Ga) edotreotide (Hofmann et al.  2001).   
The proposed activity for gallium (68Ga) edotreotide in SomaKit TOC (100 to 200 MBq for an average 70-kg 
adult) is consistent with the published evidence and also follows the currently available EANM guidelines.

68Ga-edotreotide PET 
results in high T/NT 
contrast within a period of 
30–40 min p.i. Specific 
advantages are low kidney 
accumulation and 
visualisation of small organs 
with physiological SST 
receptors. T/NTR are higher 
than those achieved with 
111In-octreotide. This 
allows for the detection of 
very small lesions, which 
may become of decisive 
importance when SSTR PET 
is used in clinical routine  
68Ga-edotreotide is a 
promising PET tracer for 
imaging NET and their 
metastases. In comparison 
to the 111In-DTPAOC it 
seems to be superior 
especially in detecting small 
tumours or tumours 
bearing only a low density 
of SSTRs. It offers excellent 
imaging properties and very 
high T/NTR.  
68Ga-edotreotide uptake in 
NETs is mainly dependent 
on k1(receptor binding) and 
Vb (fractional blood 
volume). Pharmacokinetic 
data analysis can help to 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
separate blood background 
activity (Vb) from the 
receptor binding (k1). 
68Ga-edotreotide is a 
promising tool for 
evaluation of the SSTR2 
expression NETs. The 
combination of FDG and 
68Ga-edotreotide dynamic 
PET studies provides 
different information 
regarding the biological 
properties of lesions in 
patients with metastatic 
NETs 
68Ga-edotreotide PET is 
superior to 111In-
DTPAOCSPECT in the 
detection of NET 
manifestations in the lung 
and skeleton and similar for 
the detection of NET 
manifestations in the liver 
and brain. 68Ga-
edotreotide PET is 
advantageous in guiding the 
clinical management.

68Ga-edotreotide PET 
shows no advantage over 
conventional anatomic 
imaging for assessing 
response to therapy when 
all CT information obtained 
during follow-up is 
compared. Only the 
development of new 
metastases during therapy 
was detected earlier in 
some cases when whole-
body PET was used. SUV 
analysis of individual lesions 
is of no additional value in 
predicting individual 
responses to therapy. 
This initial experience with 
the combined use of FDG 
and 68Ga-edotreotide PET-
CT reveals different uptake 
patterns in various 
bronchial tumours. 
68Ga-edotreotide PET is a 
reliable, method for the 
early detection of bone 
metastases in patients with 
NET. CT and conventional 
bone scintigraphy are less

68Ga-edotreotide and 
FDOPAPET are useful tools 
in the detection and staging 
of NET lesions. 68Ga-
edotreotide may have a 
stronger impact in NET 
patients as it does not only 
offer diagnostic 
information, but is decisive 
for further treatment 
management. 
68Ga-edotreotide PET/CT 
proved clearly superior to 
CT and/or MRI for detection

important, 68Ga-

No CT phase can be omitted 
in NET imaging, and the 
triple-phase protocol 
continues to be strongly 
recommended also for 
PET/CT. 
68Ga-edotreotide PET/CT 
allows a high detection rate 
of NET lesions in the 
context of MEN-1syndrome 
as well as influence 
therapeutic management in 
nearly up to half of the 
patients. GA-68 
DOTATOCPET/CT should 
include a CE-CT to improve 
MEN-associated NET lesion 
detection. 
Intravenous. Contrast 
medium only moderately, 
albeit significantly, 
improves the sensitivity of 
68Ga-edotreotide PET/CT 
for the detection of 
abdominal NETs, and hardly 
affects specificity. Thus, 
while contrast 
enhancement is justified to 
achieve maximum 
sensitivity, unenhanced 
images may be sufficient for 
routine PET/CT in NET 
patients.

The arterial phase of 
multiphase 68Ga-
edotreotide PET/CT might 
improve the localisation of 
intestinal NETs and, 
thereby, improve the 
overall diagnostic accuracy 
of this modality in the 
assessment of intestinal 
NETs by adding information 
about lesion perfusion not 
available when only venous 
CT is performed. 
68Ga-edotreotide PET/CT is 
a useful imaging 
investigation for the 
evaluation of pulmonary 
NETs FDGPET/CT suffers 
from low sensitivity and 
specificity in differentiating 
the pulmonary NETs from 
other tumours.

SUVmax cut-off of >16.4

enables the translation of 
our results to other 
institutions. However, the 
robustness of this arbitrary 
unit still needs to be 
evaluated with different 
PET scanners.

68Ga-edotreotide PET is

and quantify liver 
metastases in daily routine,

68Ga-edotreotide was 
useful for detecting NETs, 
especially when recurrence 
or metastases were 
suspected because of high

unlikely, however, that 
additional information can 
be acquired in patients with

based on high hormone

Diagnostic and technical Performance of 68Ga-edotreotide 
1.  Detection of the primary NET in case of proven NET metastasis or rising levels of a relevant Biochemical 
Tumour Marker 
In the study of Gabriel et al. 200775, a group of patients was referred for detection of unknown primary 
tumour  in  the  presence  of  clinical  or  biochemical  suspicion  of  neuroendocrine  malignancy,  the patient-
based sensitivity and specificity were the best with gallium (68Ga) edotreotide (4/5=80% and 8/9=89%). 
The sensitivity  and specificity was 2/5=40% and 8/9=89% with SPECT  and  3/5=60% and  8/9=89%  with 
CT.  One  false  positive  result  consisting  in  increased tracer  uptake  was  observed  both  on  PET  and  SPECT 
in  pancreatic  head.  Two  false  negative results  were  observed  with  SPECT  and  one  with  CT  in  case  of 
small  metastatic  liver  lesions which were positive with gallium (68Ga) edotreotide. 
In  3  of  4  patients  with  unknown  primary  tumour  site  of  the  series  of  Frilling  et  al.  2010  (Frilling 
2010)76, gallium (68Ga) edotreotide  PET/CT  visualised  the  primary  tumour  region  (jejunum,  ileum,  and 
pancreas, respectively) not identified on CT and/or MRI. 
One head-to-head comparative paper of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide and Octreoscan is that of Schreiter et al. 
2014. In a total of 123 included patients with either CUP-NET or clinically suspected primary NET, the direct 
comparison of diagnostic performance of images with both radiopharmaceuticals was possible in 20 patients. 
The standard of truth included histopathology or clinical verification based on follow-up examinations. The 
detection rate of primary tumour was 2/20=10% for indium (111In) pentetreotide and 9/20=45% for gallium 
(68Ga) edotreotide. Imaging with gallium (68Ga) edotreotide PET/CT was able to identify the primary tumour 
in 7/15=47% patients who had negative findings according to indium (111In) pentetreotide SPECT/CT 
performed at the first examination. In two patients with a primary tumour detected by indium (111In) 
pentetreotide SPECT/CT, the gallium (68Ga) edotreotide confirmed the result. When indium (111In) 
pentetreotide SPECT/CT was performed at the second examination after gallium (68Ga) edotreotide PET/CT 
with negative findings (n=3), the procedure did not provide additional diagnostic information. 
2.  Ga-edotreotide  and  characterisation,  staging  and  restaging  of  primary  and metastatic GEP NET: 
Comparison  of  diagnostic  performance  with  somatostatin  receptor  scintigraphy (SRS) with indium 
(111In) pentetreotide or with 99mTc-HYNIC-[D-Phe1,Tyr3]-Octreotide 
The technical performance was made with indium (111In) pentetreotide, the radiopharmaceutical which has 
been registered in the indications which are claimed for gallium (68Ga) edotreotide and marketed as 
Octreoscan or with 99mTc-HYNIC-[D-Phe1,Tyr3]-Octreotide which is marketed as 99mTc-Tektrotyd. 
The pharmacological properties of OctreoScan compared to newer analogues are different and further 
compounded by its radionuclide, 111In, which provides relatively poor quality images in SPECT and planar 
scans (Baum 201277). The spatial resolution of tumour targeted In-111-labelled peptides is poor because of 
the non-optimal energy of the emitted γ-rays. The low spatial resolution contributes to equivocal diagnosis of

suspected lesions (Srirajaskanthan 2010)78. In the European consensus guidelines it is acknowledged that 
somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) using Octreoscan is an important part of the diagnostic work-up of 
patients with GEP-NETs (Delle Fave et al. 2012, Ramage et al. 2012, Öberg et al. 2012). It can still be 
considered the molecular imaging technique of choice at diagnosis and follow-up in the majority of patients 
with well-differentiated GEP-NET (level of evidence 3, grade of recommendation A/B) (Toumpanakis et al. 
2014).   
No   literature   data   addressing   the   intra-individual   comparison   of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide   and 
99mTc-Tektrotyd was submitted. 
In comparison with scintigraphic imaging of SSTR (SRS), planar and/or SPECT which is performed with 
indium (111In) pentetreotide, PET imaging of SSR (SRPET) which is used for gallium (68Ga) edotreotide 
imaging has a two- (Gregory 2006)79 to three-fold higher spatial resolution (3 to 6 mm vs. 10 to 15 mm). 
PET/CT facilitates quantification of tracer uptake and biodistribution administered by either using 
compartmental analysis for research applications or more simple parameters in routine (standardised uptake 
value or SUV); a similar approach is not possible with SPECT. 
The first data on diagnostic performance of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide compared to indium (111In) 
pentetreotide were published by Hofmann et al. 2001, for detecting tumours expressing SSTRs and their 
metastases in 8 patients with histologically proven bronchial (n=2) or midgut (n=6) NETs. Of 40 lesions 
predefined by CT and/or MRI, gallium (68Ga) edotreotide PET identified 40/40=100%, whereas indium (111In) 
pentetreotide planar and SPECT imaging identified only 34/40=85%. T/NTR ranged from >3:1 for hepatic 
lesions (indium (111In) pentetreotide=1.5) to 100 for CNS lesions (indium (111In) pentetreotide=10). With 
gallium (68Ga) edotreotide, more than 30% additional lesions were detected as compared with indium (111In) 
pentetreotide imaging. 
Gabriel et al. 2007 compared diagnostic performance of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide and that of 99mTc-labeled 
hydrazinonicotinyl-Tyr3-octreotide (99mTc-HYNIC-TOC) and 111In-edotreotide for staging 36 patients with 
proven or suspected NET. A composite standard of truth (SOT) was used: conventional imaging (CT or MRI) 
in case of concordant findings and histology and/or clinical follow-up >6 months in case of discordant findings 
of PET and SPECT with results of conventional imaging. On a per-patient base, the sensitivity and specificity 
were the best with gallium (68Ga) edotreotide, 32/33=97% and 3/ 4=75% respectively. For SPECT (99mTc-
HYNIC-TOC and 111In-edotreotide) the sensitivity and specificity were 14/33=42% and 3/22=14% and 
similarly for CT 16/33=48% and 3/5=16%, respectively. 
This series of Gabriel et al. also included 35 patients referred for restaging after primary treatment of NET 
(Gabriel 2007). The patient-based sensitivity and specificity was the best with gallium (68Ga) edotreotide 
(33/34=97% and 1/1=100%). The sensitivity and specificity was 21/34=62% and 1/1=100% with SPECT 
and 22/32=69% and 1/3=33% with CT. One false negative result was observed with gallium (68Ga) 
edotreotide in patient with small liver metastases. On the other hand, small liver metastases and small lymph 
nodes were missed by SPECT and CT the most frequently, but visible with gallium (68Ga) edotreotide. 
Buchmann et al. 2007 compared the value of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide PET and indium (111In) pentetreotide 
SPECT in 27 patients with GEP-NET (59%) or GEP-NETs of unknown primary (30%) and 3 non GEP-NET. 
Gallium (68Ga) edotreotide PET and indium (111In) pentetreotide SPECT were performed using standard 
techniques; treatment was not applied in between. A composite standard of truth was used. Findings were

compared by a region-by-region analysis and verified with histopathology, CT and MRI within 21 days. SOT 
was obtained before therapy was initiated, whenever clinically and ethically justifiable. In several organs, 
metastases were multifocal and particularly confluent, limiting a lesion-based analysis.  gallium (68Ga) 
edotreotide PET imaged more lesions than indium (111In) pentetreotide SPECT. On gallium (68Ga) edotreotide 
PET, >279 lesions were positive (absolute numbers cannot be given owing to confluence of lesions). Lesions 
were most frequently seen in the liver (n>152), the skeleton (n>80) and lymph nodes (n>28). The mean 
SUV of all positive lesions ranged from 0.7 to 29.3 and the maximum SUV ranged from 0.9 to 34.4. In three 
lesions, the mean SUV was ≤1.1 (brain 0.7, skeleton 0.9, lung 1.1). 
On indium (111In) pentetreotide SPECT, a total of >157 lesions were positive. Lesions were most frequently 
seen in the liver (n>105), skeleton (n>20) and lymph nodes (n>21). The ratio between pathological positive 
lesions and the contralateral area was within a range from 1.8 to 7.3. The number of positive lesions on 
SPECT images acquired 4 and 24 h after injection did not differ significantly. A total of 52/81= 64% regions 
were interpreted as concordantly positive on gallium (68Ga) edotreotide PET and indium (111In) pentetreotide 
SPECT and 31/81=38% regions were interpreted as discordant. Among 18 discrepant sites with SOT, all were 
positive with gallium (68Ga) edotreotide and negative with indium (111In) pentetreotide (p<0.001). In a single 
patient (1/27=3.7%), gallium (68Ga) edotreotide PET imaged widespread infiltration in 7 abdominal and 
pelvic lymph nodes, whilst indium (111In) pentetreotide SPECT was positive in a single node. In this case, 
surgical intervention was extended owing to the PET findings. All 7 gallium (68Ga) edotreotide - and the single 
indium (111In) pentetreotide- positive nodes were positive at histopathology. No impact on patient 
management was observed with indium (111In) pentetreotide. In this study gallium (68Ga) edotreotide PET 
identified significantly more lesions of NET than indium (111In) pentetreotide. 
Van Binnebeek et al. 2015 compared the diagnostic accuracy of indium (111In) pentetreotide and gallium 
(68Ga) edotreotide in patients with metastatic NET scheduled for PRRT [GEP-NET (n=39), unknown origin 
(n=6) and non-GEP-NETs (n=8)]. In 53 patients, gallium (68Ga) edotreotide detected 1098/1099=99.9% 
lesions (range: 1-105; median: 15) and indium (111In) pentetreotide detected 660/1099=60% lesions 
(range: 0-73, median: 9)(p<0.0001). 439/1098=40% lesions in 42/53=79% patients were detected by 
gallium (68Ga) edotreotide alone. Inversely, indium (111In) pentetreotide was positive alone in 1/53 patients. 
The organ-by-organ analysis showed that the gallium (68Ga) edotreotide -positive-alone lesions were most 
frequently visualized in liver and skeleton. It was concluded that gallium (68Ga) edotreotide PET/CT is 
superior for the detection of NET-metastases compared to indium (111In) pentetreotide. 
In the prospective study of Lee et al. in 13 GEP-NET patients (3 of them with suspected but not confirmed 
disease), a total of 35 positive lesions (i.e. positive means that lesion exhibited non-physiological increased 
uptake that was not discernible from the background) were detected in 10 patients on either Octreoscan 
SPECT/CT or Gallium (68Ga) edotreotide PET/CT. Three patients did not exhibit any positive lesions on either 
imaging method. Gallium (68Ga) edotreotide detected 35/35 (100%) vs 19/35=54% for Octreoscan 
SPECT/CT.   
In the prospective study of Kowalski et al.2003 in 4 patients with GEP-NET, Gallium (68Ga) edotreotide 
showed better patient-based detection rate (4/4=100%) than Octreoscan (2/4=50%). In one of these 
patients both radiopharmaceuticals showed multicentrical small bowel carcinoid in the lower abdomen, but at 
least seven small tracer accumulations were found in the left lower abdomen only in Gallium (68Ga) 
edotreotide PET.

3.  Comparison of diagnostic performance with Bone Scintigraphy 
Putzer et al. compared the diagnostic value of CT with that of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide in the detection of 
bone metastases in 51 patients with histologically proven NET after treatment (Putzer et al. 2009)80. 18F-
fluoride  PET  or 99mTc-dicarboxypropane  diphosphonate  bone  scintigraphy or  other imaging methods  (FDG 
PET,  MRI)  or  clinical  follow-up  served  as  the  reference  standard. Gallium (68Ga) edotreotide PET results 
were true-negative for 12 patients, false-positive for one, and false- negative  for  another,  resulting  in  a 
sensitivity  of  37/38=97%  and  a  specificity  of  12/13=92%. The  sensitivity  of  CT  for  detection  of  bone 
metastases  was  22/38=58%  and  specificity 13/13=100%. Gallium (68Ga) edotreotide  PET  detected  bone 
metastases  at  a  significantly higher  rate than did CT (P<0.001). Furthermore, conventional bone 
scintigraphy confirmed the results of SRPET but did not reveal additional tumours in any patients. 
4.  Comparison of diagnostic performance with other PET tracers 
FDOPA, an amino acid analogue, has been registered since 2006 for the detection of some NET using 
PET/CT. Putzer et al performed a comparative study of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide and FDOPA PET and CT in 
15 patients with various NET (Putzer et al 2010)81. Images were compared on a patient-basis as  well  as  on 
a  lesion-basis.  Contrast-enhanced  CT  and  histological  follow-up  served  as  the standard  of  truth. 
Furthermore,  imaging  results  were  matched  with  tumour  marker  levels  and quantitative tracer  uptake  by 
the  NET  lesions.  Both gallium (68Ga) edotreotide  and  FDOPA  PET  reached sensitivity  of  64%  and  a 
specificity  of  100%  on  a  patient-based  analysis. Gallium (68Ga) edotreotide  and FDOPA  PET  showed equal 
findings  in  7 out of  15  patients  and  differences  in  8 patients. Gallium (68Ga) edotreotide revealed  more 
metastases  than  FDOPA  PET  in  6  patients,  while  FDOPA  PET detected  more  metastases  than gallium 
(68Ga) edotreotide  in  4  patients.  With gallium (68Ga) edotreotide  PET,  208 malignant lesions were detected, 
with FDOPA 86 lesions were found, and only 124 with CT. 
Koukouraki et al. 2006 compared by  means of dynamic PET in 15 patients with 63 lesions of confirmed 
metastatic  NETs  the  uptake  of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide  and  of  FDG,  a  marker  of  tumour glucose 
uptake  and  metabolism  also  suited  for  PET  imaging.  Histology of the  primary  tumours  was  confirmed  in 
surgical  specimens.  Histology  of  the  metastases  was confirmed (depending on the location) in 11 out of 
15 patients by needle biopsy. For lesions that were  not  easily reachable,  the  diagnosis  was  based  on 
computed  tomography (CT)  and/or  MRI follow-up findings and on clinical follow-up data. Enhanced FDG 
uptake  was  observed  in 43/63=68.3%  lesions. gallium (68Ga) edotreotide  showed  pathologically enhanced 
uptake  in  all  evaluated patients and in 58/63=92% lesions; 6 lesions were missed by gallium (68Ga) 
edotreotide: 1 in a patient with metastatic NET of unknown primary, 3 in a patient with metastatic medullary 
thyroid carcinoma, 1  in  a  patient  with  a  metastatic  lung  NET  and  1  in  a  patient  with  a  paraganglioma. 
Discordant results for FDG and gallium (68Ga) edotreotide were observed in 6/15 patients. Global SUV was 
defined as the SUV measured in the last frame (55–60 min p.i.) of the dynamic series, for each tracer. The 
median global SUV uptake was 7.9 for gallium (68Ga) edotreotide and 4.6 for FDG. The authors concluded 
that the  combination of  FDG  and gallium (68Ga) edotreotide  dynamic  PET  studies provides different 
information  regarding  the  biological  properties  of  lesions  in  patients  with  metastatic  NETs  in whom 90Y-
edotreotide therapy is planned.  Only patients with enhanced gallium (68Ga) edotreotide uptake (SUV >5.0) 
were referred to 90Y-edotreotide therapy in this study.

There were no significant differences between patients with positive gallium (68Ga) edotreotide and those 
with positive FDG in  regards to therapeutic  choice and  it was  concluded  that the association of gallium 
(68Ga) edotreotide  and  FDG  slightly increases  detection  rate  of  pancreatic  NET  over gallium (68Ga) 
edotreotide PET/CT alone. However, the combined dual tracers (FDG and gallium (68Ga) edotreotide PET/CT) 
did not influence the therapeutic strategy. 
5.  Comparison of Diagnostic Performance between gallium (68Ga) edotreotide PET/CT and anatomic imaging 
and the potential role of PET with contrast enhanced CT 
In a series of 20 patients with proven (n=3) or suspected primary pancreatic NET (n=17), gallium (68Ga) 
edotreotide correctly identified the primary or characterised the lesion as pancreatic NET in 20/20=100% 
cases using as standard of truth biopsy and histopathology for primary tumour (Kumar 2011). The detection 
rate of CE CT for primary tumour was 15/20=75%. Two false positive results were observed with CE CT. In 3 
patients CE CT failed to show primary tumour. Distant metastases were correctly identified by gallium (68Ga) 
edotreotide in all patients (sensitivity 13/13=100%), whereas CE CT identified only 7/13=57.1% of patients 
with distant metastases. In 4 patients, CE CT missed infracentimetric liver metastases, and in 5 patients 
infracentimetric non-enhancing lymph nodes. In 8 patients the FDG PET/CT was performed as well and its 
detection rate of primary tumour was 2/8=25%. 
Versari et al. 201082 compared the value of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), multidetector CT (MDCT) and 
gallium (68Ga) edotreotide PET/CT to detect and characterise the primary tumour in patients suspected to 
have primary duodenopancreatic NET. Nineteen consecutive patients underwent both gallium (68Ga) 
edotreotide PET/CT and EUS, 16 patients underwent MDCT as well. Twenty-three NET were confirmed by 
cytology or histology in 13/19 patients. EUS correctly identified 13/13=100%, gallium (68Ga) edotreotide 
PET/CT 12/13=92%, and MDCT 10/11=91% of duodenopancreatic NET patients. On a lesion base, EUS 
correctly identified 22/23=96%, gallium (68Ga) edotreotide PET/CT 20/23=87% and MDCT 13/18=72% 
lesions (P=0.08 EUS vs. CT). Both on a patient and on a lesion base, specificity was 4/6=67% for EUS, 
5/6=83% for gallium (68Ga) edotreotide PET/CT and 4/5=80% for MDCT. The authors concluded that EUS, 
gallium (68Ga a) edotreotide and MDCT had comparable accuracy in diagnosis of local duodenopancreatic NET 
and proposed their combination for optimal preoperative diagnosis. 
Schraml et al. 200383 performed gallium (68Ga) edotreotide PET/CT and whole-body magnetic resonance 
imaging (wbMRI) in 51 patients with histologically proven NET and suspicion of metastatic spread within a 
mean interval of 2.4 days (range 0-28 days). The CT protocol comprised multiphase CE CT imaging. The MRI 
protocol consisted of standard sequences before and after intravenous contrast administration at 1.5 T. Each 
modality (PET, CT, PET/CT, wbMRI) was evaluated independently by two experienced readers, with a 
consensus decision based on correlation of all imaging data. Histologic and surgical findings and clinical 
follow-up was established as the standard of truth. In 41/51=80% patients, 593 metastatic NET lesions were 
detected (lung 54, liver 266, bone 131, lymph node 99, other 43). One hundred and twenty PET-negative 
lesions were detected by CT or MRI. Of all 593 lesions detected, PET identified 381/593=64% true-positive 
lesions, CT 482/593=81%, PET/CT 545/593=92% and wbMRI 540/593=91%. Comparison of lesion-based 
detection rates between PET/CT and wbMRI revealed significantly higher sensitivity of PET/CT for metastatic 
lymph nodes (100% vs. 73%; p<0.0001) and pulmonary lesions (100% vs. 87%; p<0.0233), whereas

wbMRI had significantly higher detection rates for liver (99% vs. 92%; p<0.0001) and bone lesions (96% vs. 
82%; p<0.0001). Of all 593 lesions, 22 were found only in PET, 11 only in CT and 47 only in wbMRI. The 
patient-based overall assessment of the metastatic status of the patient showed comparable sensitivity of 
PET/CT and MRI with slightly higher accuracy of PET/CT. Patient-based analysis of metastatic organ 
involvement revealed significantly higher accuracy of PET/CT for bone and lymph node metastases 
(51/51=100% vs. 45/51=88%; p=0.0412 and 50/51=98% vs. 40/51=78%; p=0.0044) and for the overall 
comparison (251/253=99% vs. 227/253=89%; p<0.0001). 
Froeling et al. 2012 analysed the diagnostic performance of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide in patients with 
multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) proven by histology, biology or anatomic imaging. Twenty-eight gallium 
(68Ga) edotreotide PET/CTs were performed in 21 MEN patients. Nineteen patients suffered from MEN-1, one 
from MEN-2a and one from MEN-2b syndrome. The examination was performed at restaging in 24 patients or 
at initial staging in 4 patients. Results of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide were compared with composite standard 
of truth consisting of histopathologic examination and/or clinical follow-up data or the following imaging 
modalities such as CT, MRI, ultrasound, or further PET/CT. One hundred sixty-eight lesions were counted by 
28 gallium (68Ga) edotreotide PET/CT scans in 21 patients. Lesions appearing in consecutive PET/CT 
examinations were rated in the first examination only to avoid cluster effects from lesions counted repeatedly 
resulting in 127 lesions by only counting once. For 18 lesions, the standard of truth could not be obtained 
(10/18=55.6% were enlarged adrenal glands). A total of 109 lesions could be included in analysis: 78 lesions 
were MEN-associated lesions (in gastrointestinal tract, lymph nodes, lung, bones, pancreas, liver and 
parathyroid gland) and 31 non-MEN-associated lesions. The majority of 19 patients had a MEN-1 syndrome 
with a total of 91 MEN-associated lesions. 60 lesions were NET lesions and 31 lesions were benign MEN-
associated lesions. In 16 cases, the gallium (68Ga) edotreotide PET/CT was performed including a contrast 
enhanced (CE) CT. In this group 47 lesions (37 malignant, 10 benign) were confirmed. In conclusion, gallium 
(68Ga) edotreotide PET/CT allows a high detection rate of NET lesions in the context of MEN-1 syndrome as 
well as influence therapeutic management in nearly up to half of the patients. Gallium (68Ga) edotreotide 
PET/ CT should include a CE-CT to improve MEN-associated NET lesion detection. 
The question whether or not PET/ CE CT may improve the diagnostic performance of PET/CT was also 
addressed by Mayerhoefer et al. 2012.  In 55 patients with known or suspected NET, the 68Ga-PET/ CE CT 
was performed. Images were interpreted by senior and junior team and results were compared to the 
composite standard of truth consisting out of histology, clinical follow-up and results of imaging 
examinations. Patient based sensitivities and specificities were for “unenhanced junior team” 33/33=100% 
and 17/22=77%, for “unenhanced senior team” 32/33=97% and 18/22=81.8%, for “CE-junior team”   
33/33=100% and 20/22=90.9% and for “CE senior team” 33/33=100% and 21/22=95.5%. Overall, the 
contrast media application increased the sensitivity of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide PET/CT to only moderate 
degree and in most cases unenhanced PET/CT was sufficient for detection of abdominal NETs and their 
metastases. 
The same question was also addressed by Ruf et al. 201184 who analysed the value of the triple-phase (early 
arterial, portal-venous inflow, and venous) CE CT in comparison to gallium (68Ga) edotreotide PET gallium 
(68Ga) edotreotide PET/CT with triple-phase CE CT was performed in 51 patients with known or suspected 
NET and two readers assessed the data of PET and each of the 3 CT phases for NET lesions independently 
and a consensus of readings was reached. Only lesions within the abdominal field were evaluated since triple-
phase CE CT cannot be performed as a whole body examination. Clinical and imaging follow-up,

histopathology (if available), and the decision of an interdisciplinary truth-panel served as a composite 
standard of truth. NET was confirmed in 39/51 patients. The patient-based sensitivity, specificity and 
accuracy for PET and triple-phase CT were 82%, 67%, 96% and 84.6%, 50%, 76.6% respectively. Of 510 
abdominal lesions observed, 354 were classified as malignant; lesion-based sensitivity was 77.1% for 
combined triple phase CT, 53.4% for arterial CT, 66.1% for portal-venous CT, 66.9% for venous CT, and 
72.8% for PET. The respective specificities were 85.3%, 92.9%, 92.3%, 89.7%, and 97.4%. Although arterial 
CT was found to be inferior to PET, portal-venous CT, and venous CT (P<0.001), the differences between the 
other scans were not significant. Detection was exclusively by PET for 16.1% of lesions, by triple-phase CT 
for 20.3%, by arterial CT for 0.5%, by portal-venous CT for 3.9%, and by venous CT for 3.9%. Regarding 
inter-observer reliability, the kappa-value was 0.768 for PET, 0.391 for triple-phase CT, 0.577 for arterial CT, 
0.583 for portal-venous CE CT, and 0.482 for venous CE CT. In summary, similar patient based sensitivities 
were observed for PET and triple-phase CE CT; The reproducibility of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide PET was 
higher than that of triple-phase CT. Ruf et al. concluded that gallium (68Ga) edotreotide PET/CT in NET 
patients should be performed as PET/ triple-phase CE CT. 
6.  Gallium (68Ga) edotreotide and Predicting and Monitoring of Therapeutic Response in NET  
The gallium (68Ga) edotreotide  uptake  by  NET  lesions  measured  by  SUV  on  PET  may  be  helpful  to 
predict the absorbed dose during PRRT as proposed by Ezziddin et al. 2012. Data of 21  patients  with  61 
evaluable  tumour  lesions  undergoing  both  pretherapeutic gallium (68Ga) edotreotide PET/CT  and  PRRT 
with 177Lu-octreotate  (6.08-8.86  GBq;  intratherapeutic  tumour  dosimetry with serial whole-body scans; 1, 
2, and 4 days post injection)  were  analysed. SUVs were compared  with  the  tumour-absorbed  doses  per 
injected  activity  (D/A0)  of  the  subsequent  first treatment cycle. The correlation of SUV and D/A0 was r = 
0.72 (SUVmean) and r=0.71 (SUVmax), both P<0.001. Pancreatic origin and hepatic localisation were 
associated with higher D/A0  and  chromogranin-A  level.  Ki-67  index  had  no  influence  on  SUV  or  D/A0. 
High-SUV lesions (SUVmean >15; SUVmax >25) resulted in high D/A0 (>10 Gy/GBq) in 66.7% to 70.8% 
and  low  D/A0  (<5  Gy/GBq)  in  only  8.3%  to  12.5%  on  subsequent  PRRT.  The  mentioned  low D/A0 range, 
on the other hand, was achieved by all lesions with SUVmean <7 or SUVmax  <9. In  summary,  SRPET 
may  predict  tumour  absorbed  doses  on  PRRT.  The  ability  to  indicate insufficient target irradiation by a 
low SUV could aid in selection of  appropriate candidates  for PRRT. 
Two  years  later,  Kratochwil  et  al. 2015  published  their  results  on  quantitative  analysis  of gallium 
(68Ga) edotreotide  uptake  by  liver  metastases  of  NET  as  a  predictor  of  therapeutic  response  to PRRT.  In 
this  study, gallium (68Ga) edotreotide  PET/CT  was  performed  in  30  NET patients with 60 liver metastases 
at baseline and after PRRT. SUVmax of all hepatic lesions, of normal  liver  and  spleen  were  measured  and 
tumour  to  spleen  ratio  (T/S  ratio),  and  tumour  to liver  ratio  (T/L  ratio)  were  calculated.  Based  on 
morphological  criteria,  after  three  cycles  of PRRT, the lesions were divided into two groups: responding to 
PRRT (n = 40) and non- responding to PRRT (n = 20).  Statistically significant  differences  were  observed  in 
the  mean  SUVmax  for  non-responding vs. responding lesions at baseline (18.00 ± 3.59 vs. 33.55 ± 4.62, 
p < 0.05) and for the mean T/S ratio (1.20 ± 0.37 vs. 1.90 ± 0.45, p < 0.05) and the mean T/L ratio 
(3.15 ± 0.53 vs. 4.97 ± 0.62, p < 0.05). Using the receiver operating characteristic curves, SUVmax was 
found a better metric than both T/L ratio and T/S ratio (area under the curve (AUC) of SUVmax 0.87; T/L 
ratio 0.78; T/S  ratio  0.73)  as  a  stratification  criterion.  Using  a  threshold  value  of  >16.4  for  SUVmax,  the 
sensitivity  and  specificity  in  predicting  responding  lesions  were  95  and  60%,  respectively.  In conclusion, 
with  gallium (68Ga) edotreotide  PET/CT  the  SUVmax  cut-off  of  >16.4  was  proposed  as  a selection 
criteria  of  patients  indicated  to  PRRT.  A  T/L  ratio  >2.2  might  present  a  scanner- independent  criterion 
that  enables  the  translation  of  these  results  to  other  institutions;  however this approach still needs to be 
evaluated with different PET cameras.

Similarly as in the case of other anticancer treatment, an accurate method is needed also in case of PRRT. 
In the study of Gabriel et al. (Gabriel 2007), early evaluation of therapeutic response to PRRT  was  compared 
using gallium (68Ga) edotreotide,  or  CT  or  MRI  using  the  Response  Evaluation Criteria  in  Solid  Tumours 
(RECIST).  Furthermore,  on gallium (68Ga) edotreotide  PET,  the  standardised uptake values (SUVs) were 
calculated and compared with treatment outcome. Data of 46 patients with  advanced  NETs  were  analysed 
before  and  after  2–7  cycles  of  PRRT.  Long-acting somatostatin  analogues  were  not  applied  for  at  least  6 
weeks  preceding  the  follow  up gallium (68Ga) edotreotide  imaging. Gallium (68Ga) edotreotide  PET  images 
were  visually  interpreted  by  2  nuclear medicine  physicians.  For  comparison,  multislice  helical  CT  scans 
and  1.5-T  MRI  scans  were obtained.  Repeated  CT  evaluation  and  other  imaging  modalities  were  used  as 
the  SOT. According to the SOT, gallium (68Ga) edotreotide PET and CT showed a concordant result in 
32/46=70% of  patients.  In  the  remaining  14/46=30%  of  patients,  discrepancies  were  observed,  with  a 
final outcome  of  progressive  disease  in  9  patients  and  remission  in  5  patients. Gallium (68Ga) edotreotide 
PET was correct in 10/46=21.7% patients, including 5/9=56% of patients with progressive disease. In these 
patients,  metastatic  spread  was  detected  with  the  follow-up  whole-body  PET  but  was missed  when 
concomitant  CT  was  used.  On  the  other  hand,  CT  confirmed  small  pulmonary metastases not detected 
on gallium (68Ga) edotreotide in 1 patient and progressive liver disease not detected on gallium (68Ga) 
edotreotide in 3 patients. In summary, gallium (68Ga) edotreotide PET showed no advantage  over 
conventional  anatomic  imaging  for  assessing  response  to  therapy  when  all  CT information obtained during 
follow-up is compared. However, in addition to conventional imaging, gallium (68Ga) edotreotide  whole-body 
PET  can  be  helpful  as  an  early  predictor  of  progressive disease by detecting new metastases that 
developed during therapy. 
In  the  study  of  Kroiss  et  al.  (Kroiss  2013),  a  decrease  in  SUVmax  more  than  3  months  after PRRT  was 
found  both in  organs  with  physiological  uptake  (thyroid,  lungs,  spleen,  adrenal glands,  gluteal  region, 
blood  pool,  uncinate  process)  and  in  pathological  distribution  of 68Ga-edotreotide. However, a significant 
change in SUVmax after PRRT was only found in NET patients  with  liver  metastases  (p<0.02)  in  contrast 
to  those  with  bone  metastases  (p<0.1)  and those  with  NET  of  the  pancreas  (p<0.3). 
The  variation  of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide  uptake  by  liver  metastases  of  GEP  NET  after  PRRT  was 
analysed by Luboldt et al. 201085. The  aim of their study was to propose standardised method of therapy 
monitoring of hepatic metastases from GEP NET during the course of PRRT. In 21 consecutive patients with 
non-resectable hepatic metastases of GEP NET, chromogranin A (CgA) and gallium (68Ga) edotreotide PET/CT 
were compared before and after the last PRRT. On gallium (68Ga) edotreotide PET/CT, the SUVmax of 
normal liver and hepatic metastases was calculated. In addition, the volumes of hepatic metastases (volume 
of interest [VOI]) were measured using four cut-offs to separate normal liver tissue from metastases 
(SUVmax of the normal liver plus 10% [VOIliver+10%], 20% [VOIliver+20%], 30% [VOIliver+30%] and 
SUV=10 [VOI10SUV]). The SUVmax  of  the  normal  liver  was  below  10  (7.2±  1.3)  in  all  patients  and 
without  significant changes.  Overall  therapy changes  (Δ)  per  patient  (mean  [95%  CI])  were  statistically 
significant with p<0.01 for Δ CgA -43 (-69 to -17), Δ SUVmax -22 (-29 to -14), and Δ VOI10SUV  -53 (-68 to 
-8)% and significant with p<0.05 for Δ VOIliver+10%  -29 (-55 to -3)%, Δ VOIliver+20%  -32 (-62 to - 2)  and 
Δ  VOIliver+30%    -37  (-66  to  -8).  Correlations  were  found  only  between  Δ  CgA  and  Δ VOI10SUV 
(r=0.595;  p<0.01),  Δ  SUVmax  and  Δ  VOI10SUV (0.629,  p<0.01),  and  SUVmax  and  Δ SUVmax (r=-0.446; 
p<0.05).

Analysis performed across trials - Meta-analysis 
Introduction 
Positron emission tomography with integrated CT (PET/CT) using the somatostatin analog, 68Ga - edotreotide, 
is still investigational, but reports in the peer-reviewed literature suggest that it is significantly superior to the 
current approved somatostatin receptor imaging “gold standard” of 111In- DTPA-octreotide (also called indium 
(111In) pentetreotide). If 68Ga - edotreotide PET/CT is at least equivalent (non-inferior) to 111In-DTPA-
octreotide imaging in the peer-reviewed literature in terms of safety and efficacy, then these results would 
support use of 68Ga - edotreotide as a PET/CT imaging agent for patients with somatostatin receptor 
expressing tumours due to less radiation exposure arising from of 68Ga-edotreotide PET/CT, and its 
significantly shorter required time between radiotracer injection to scan completion compared to 111In-
octreotide imaging. 
Rationale 
The systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to assess the published relevant information related 
to the safety, test performance and impact on disease management of PET/CT imaging with 68Ga - 
edotreotide. 
Objectives 
To perform a systematic review and, if sufficient data are available, a meta-analysis to estimate the safety 
and diagnostic and staging accuracy of 68Ga - edotreotide PET/CT for the common somatostatin receptor 
expressing tumours of pulmonary or gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) neuroendocrine tumours (NET), compared 
to the “gold standard” of 111In-octreotide imaging.  
Methods 
The systematic review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines for the publication of systematic reviews and meta-analyses (Moher 
200986). Study selection and the systematic review definition of objectives with clinical relevance followed the 
Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, and Study Type (PICOS) method.

Published from 01 January 1999 until 17 July 2015; 
Studying 68Ga - edotreotide  PET/CT  imaging  performance,  including  but  not  limited to 
studies which used 111In-DTPA-Octreotide SPECT as a direct comparator; 
Reported enough data to draft an imaging performance 2x2 contingency table; 
Used histology, conventional imaging, clinical information or a combination of these as the 
standard of truth for tumour assessment. 
2.  Patient population: 
a. 
b. 
c. 
d. 
Primary data in humans; 
All ages; 
All genders; 
Suffering from pulmonary or GEP NETs, complying with the following criteria: 
Embryonic site of origin (Pinchot 2008; Gustafsson 2008) 
(1) Foregut: (a) Broncho-pulmonary, also known as “pulmonary” NETs, (b) Stomach, (c) 
Pancreas, (d) Duodenum to the ligament of Treitz 
(2) Midgut (entire small intestinal tract distal to the ligament of Treitz, including the appendix 
and right hemi-colon to the distal transverse colon); 
(3) Hindgut (including rectum); 
(4) Publications reporting patients with metastatic disease from an unknown primary NET or in 
patients where studied imaging modalities were used to search for an unknown primary NET. In 
these cases it was assumed that the primary tumour was from the pulmonary or GEP groups 
since these two groups comprise about 90% of NETs. 
Exclusion criteria 
Any study that complied with at least one of the following exclusion criteria was not included in the 
analysis: 
1.  Publications which were either systematic reviews or case reviews; 
2.  Study population limited to 10 or less patients; 
3.  The study population included mainly other cancers without any possibility of extracting the data 
concerning pulmonary and GEP NETs; 
4.  Publications only about tumours from other sites of origin than GEP or pulmonary NETs 
5.  (e.g. ovary or nasopharynx NETs), because they are extremely rare, and are often reported either as a 
single case or a short case series, precluding meaningful statistical analysis; 
6.  Study including other imaging agents without any possibility for extracting the data only related to 68Ga- 
edotreotide; 
7.  The 68Ga - edotreotide imaging modality was not PET; 
8.  Publications with study populations included in multiple publications. Publications were excluded so that 
the population under study contributed only once to the meta-analysis. Authors were contacted if 
necessary to determine the uniqueness of a study population or when data were incomplete. Duplicate 
populations, in whole or in part, were excluded. When individual patients could not be determined, then 
the most recent publication was chosen for inclusion. 
Endpoints analysed 
All studies included in the meta-analysis were to be analyzed. The main analyses of the primary efficacy 
endpoint, secondary efficacy endpoint, and safety endpoint were to be performed on the Full Analysis Set. 
No adjustment was applied for multiple testing. 
All  efficacy  variables  were  listed  by  study.  Data  were  summarized  by  imaging  agent,  with  N, missing 
data,  mean,  median,  standard  deviation  (SD),  first  and  third  quartiles,  minimum  and maximum 
summarized  for  continuous  efficacy  variables,  and  count  and  percentage  used  to summarize 
categorical  efficacy  variables.  Overall  test  performance  was  estimated  in  a  pooled fashion using forest 
plots and HSROCs.

To test the pooling assumptions, study heterogeneity was quantitatively measured by Cochran Q and I2 
statistics and assessed graphically by forest plots and an unadjusted HSROC. A chi-square test was applied to 
determine if random effects were present. If not stated otherwise, all tests were two-tailed at the 5% 
significance level. 
Sensitivity was defined as the percentage of patients found to be positive with the imaging procedure among 
the number of patients positive with the standard of truth: 
Sensitivity %= (true positive [TP]/disease positive [DP])*100 
Specificity was defined as the percentage of patients found to be negative with the imaging procedure among 
the number of patients negative with the standard of truth: 
Specificity % = (true negative [TN]/disease negative [DN])*100 
The non-inferiority of 68Ga - edotreotide imaging performance compared to 111In-DTPA- Octreotide imaging 
performance was to be tested as follow: 
• 
The degree of study-to-study heterogeneity was measured by Cochran Q and I2 statistics and was 
visually assessed in forest plots. 
• 
• 
Study specific test performances with 95% CIs were displayed in forest plots. 
A 95% CI for the unadjusted overall sensitivity and specificity was reported. 
However, this non-inferiority analysis was not conducted due to the small number of eligible studies identified 
from the systematic review. Therefore only 68Ga - edotreotide imaging performance pooled estimates were 
calculated using an unadjusted random effect model (DerSimonian Laird method), which incorporates 
variation among studies (DerSimonian et al. 198687). The CIs of overall sensitivity and specificity were 
calculated using the Wilson’s exact method to compute the exact CIs for the binomial proportion. In addition, 
the diagnostic odds ratios were combined by the method of Rutter and Gatsonis to estimate the overall 
diagnostic odd ratio and hence to determine the best-fitting HSROC curve and the 95% confidence region for 
the overall odds ratio. The calculation of the HSROC was performed using the SAS-macro METADAS and 
displayed in Review Manager V5.3. 
Information sources 
Medline, EMBASE  and  Cochrane   Reviews   electronics   databases   were   searched  from 01 January  1999 
through  17  July  2015  without  language  restrictions:  literature  was  included  if the article  was  in  English  or 
English  abstract  translation  was  available  for  non-English  articles.  
Search strategy 
Article  search  criteria  included  all  expression  of  pulmonary  or  GEP  NETs,  including “pulmonary”,  “lung”, 
“bronchial”,  “bronchus”,  “carcinoid”,  “neuroendocrine”, “gastroenteropancreat*”, “stomach”, pancreas”, 
“kidney”, “gut”, etc. Separately any of the common  expressions  of  edotreotide, octreotide, pentetreotide, 
somatostatin or  somatostatin- derived  receptors  were  included  in  the  literature  search.  In  addition,

bibliographies  from  meta-analyses and literature reviews were examined individually and papers of interest 
included in the final list of abstracts for review. 
In studies with incomplete information, direct communication with the corresponding author was sought and 
is reported, and the studies were included in the analysis if the additional information via correspondence 
allowed inclusion. Studies with overlapping patient populations were limited to the single paper with the most 
relevant population or use of the most recent imaging technology as reported by the corresponding author or 
senior author of both manuscripts. Analysis was on a “per-patient” basis (i.e. diagnosis, staging and/or other 
impact on management) since, in patients with multiple lesions (primary tumour and metastases), it is not 
possible to confirm separately each of multiple lesions with biopsy/histology. An endpoint of cancer or benign 
diagnosis was also established and included as part of data extraction. Definitions of gold standard whether 
by pathology, imaging, or combination were abstracted. 
Data analysis 
Data synthesis 
Abstracts  were  collected  by  the  statistician  and  reviewed  independently  by  clinical  research reviewers. 
After  abstract  review,  if  the  reviewers  considered  that  full  data  extraction  should  be conducted, then a 
complete text review of the article was conducted and data extraction conducted independently by the 
reviewers. After complete article review and data extraction, the reviewers determined which studies to 
include in the final systematic review by consensus. 
All analyses were performed with SAS V9.2. In addition, other tools could have been used to explore the data 
and create graphs, as necessary. 
A descriptive summary of the design and quality of the studies included in the meta-analysis was provided. 
In  addition,  study  quality  was  assessed,  summarized  and  presented  according  to  the  modified QUADAS. 
Publication bias was  graphically charted by funnel plot and quantitatively measured by Deek’s Asymmetry 
Test (Deeks 2005). 
A  meta-analysis  model  was  to  be  estimated  if  more  than  10  studies  were  found  through  the 
systematic review. However, no direct comparative studies to 111In-DTPA-Octreotide were identified from the 
systematic review so it was not possible to conduct this analysis. 
Assessment of the quality of the data 
Study  quality  was  assessed  according  to  prospective  criteria  using  a  modified  Quality Assessment of 
Diagnostic  Accuracy Studies  (QUADAS)  set of  14  questions  (see  below) (Whiting 2003; Fontela 2009). 
These questions addressed the technical quality of the index test, the  technical  quality  of  the  reference 
test,  the  independence  and  accuracy  of  the  test interpretation,  and  the  sample  size  and  population 
representation.  Additional  quality  questions specifically measured possible mis-classification bias arising 
from pre-selection bias, incomplete diagnosis, or diagnosis driven by scan results. A quality score was 
created by adding the number of QUADAS criteria with which the study complied. The maximum possible 
score was 14.

When published data were incomplete, the authors were contacted to make every possible effort to  obtain 
additional  information  relevant  to  this  meta-analysis.  For  the  main  analysis  of  the primary endpoint, 
missing data were not replaced, and only complete cases were analyzed. 
Results 
Sensitivity Analyses 
• 
Results vary substantially for sensitivity and specificity between studies. Grubbs’ test for outliers  (Grubbs 
FE.  Procedures  for  detecting  outlying  observations  in  samples. Technometrics. 1969; 11(1):1-21.) were 
applied to identify statistical significant outliers in the  data.  As  a  sensitivity  analysis,  the  pooled  estimates 
were  performed  excluding  the identified outliers. 
The  objectives  were  to  perform  a  systematic  review  and,  if  sufficient  data  were  available,  to conduct  a 
meta-analysis  to  assess  the  safety  and  diagnostic  and staging  accuracy  of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide 
PET/CT for the common somatostatin receptor expressing tumours of pulmonary or GEP NETs, compared to 
the ‘gold standard’ of 111In-DTPA-Octreotide imaging.

Figure 7: 
HSROC Curve for 68Ga- edotreotide with 95% Confidence Region 
Based on the package insert from OctreoScan (2011), the sensitivity rate for 111In-DTPA-Octreotide 
scintigraphy is 86% and for CT/MRI the rate is 68%. The specificity rate for 111In-DTPA-Octreotide 
scintigraphy is 50%, and the rate for CT/MRI was 12%. Overall, including all tumour types with or without 
the presence of somatostatin receptors, the rate of FP was 0.6% and the rate of FN was 20.5%. Thus it can 
be seen that the sensitivity and specificity rates for 68Ga - edotreotide were similar to or better than the ones 
observed for 111In-DTPA-Octreotide scintigraphy (sensitivity 93% versus 86%; specificity and 89% versus 
50%, respectively).

The Funnel plot (Figure 2) suggests that the results from Putzer 2010 are an outlier. The Grubbs’ test 
(G=2.81;  critical  value=2.51)  confirmed  this  finding.  As  a  sensitivity  analysis,  the  pooled estimates of 
sensitivity and specificity were therefore calculated without the data of this publication. The results are 
shown in Table 4 and Table 5. The  pooled  estimates  changed  only marginally  (sensitivity  from  0.95  to 
0.96;  specificity  from  0.84  to  0.86)  but  the  inconsistency dropped for sensitivity from 57.8% to 39.3% and 
for specificity from 38.8% to 20.4%.

In  this  systematic  review,  no  studies  were  identified  that  directly compared gallium (68Ga) edotreotide  to

edotreotide with the information from the Octreoscan package insert showed that the imaging  performance 
was  similar  or  higher  than  the  one  reported  with 111In-DTPA-Octreotide, with  sensitivity  of  93%  versus

edotreotide  as  a  PET/CT  imaging  agent  for  patients  with  somatostatin receptor  expressing  NETs.  Other 
advantages  for  the  use  of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide  PET/CT  imaging over 111In-DTPA-Octreotide imaging 
include; (1) less radiation exposure; (2) significantly faster acquisition and imaging procedure (same-day); 
and (3) lower radiation exposure.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
No clinical development programme has been conducted by the applicant to support this application for 
marketing authorisation. This is acceptable as this application is under Article 10(a) of Directive 2001/83/EC, 
“well established medicinal use”. The submitted clinical documentation is being based on data available in 
published literature. The applicant has presented data from the literature since the first documented use of 
gallium (68Ga) edotreotide in Europe in 2001 to 2016, including 970 patients in total, to support the 
indications in the diagnostic work-up GEP-NET tumours. The applicant has shown that gallium (68Ga) 
edotreotide is being regularly used in the diagnostic work-up of patients with NET tumours for at least 10 
years in the European Union. In addition, the degree of scientific interest in the use of gallium (68Ga) 
edotreotide is reflected in the published scientific literature. Indeed, the European consensus clinical and 
procedural guidelines include gallium (68) edotreotide for diagnostic management of GEP-NET patients. 
The CHMP considers that the applicant has fulfilled the criteria for the legal basis for well-established use of 
edotreotide in the EU.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Technical performance of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide has been demonstrated in the publications submitted 
which showed that tumour/no tumour uptake was better for gallium (68Ga) edotreotide than Octreoscan in all 
lesions previously seen by CT/MRI. 68Ga edotreotide provides several advantages for physicians and patients. 
The gallium (68Ga) isotope has the advantage of being produced from a generator, so it can be more widely 
available in departments without the need of a cyclotron. The time window for 68Ga imaging acquisition is 
relatively short, in line with the radio- nucleide's half-life of 68 minutes, thus having an added value in terms 
of lower irradiation to patients and shorter scan timing (in one single day versus a higher irradiation and a 2-
day scan for Octreoscan). Thus, gallium (68Ga) edotreotide appears to have technical advantages over 
somatostatin receptor scintigraphy with Octreoscan for diagnosis of GEP-NET and a similar safety profile. 
For diagnostic performance, a substantial number of publications have been provided and the results are 
positive in terms of sensitivity, specificity and lesion detection rate of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide PET. For the 
detection of the primary GEP-NET site in case of rising levels of a relevant biochemical tumour marker or in 
case of proven NET metastasis, patient-based sensitivity and specificity of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide PET 
were 100% (4/4) and 89% (8/9), respectively, in the prospective study of Gabriel et al. 2007. Lesion-
detection rate was 75% (3/4) in the subgroup of patients with unknown primary tumour site of the 
prospective study of Frilling et al. 2010. In the retrospective paper of Schreiter et al. 2014, the intra-
individual comparison in a subgroup of 20 patients showed that gallium (68Ga) edotreotide permitted to 
localise the primary tumour in 9/20 (45%) patients while indium (111In) pentetreotide did in 2/20 (10%). 
A prospective intra-individual comparison showed that gallium (68Ga) edotreotide is able to detect lesions 
better than indium (111In) pentetreotide. A lesion detection rate of 100% (40/40) versus 85% (34/40) was 
observed in the study of Hofmann et al. 2001 recruiting patients with histologically proven bronchial (n=2) or 
midgut (n=6) NETs. In the study of Buchmann et al. 2007, conducted in 27 patients mostly with GEP-NET 
(59%) or NETs of unknown primary (30%), gallium (68Ga) edotreotide identified 279 lesions versus 157 
lesions seen with indium (111In) pentetreotide. In the study of Van Binnebeek et al. 2015 in 53 patients with 
metastatic GEP-NET [mostly GEP-NET (n=39) or NET of unknown origin (n=6)], the lesion-based detection 
rate of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide was 99.9% (1098/1099) versus 60% (660/1099) for indium (111In) 
pentetreotide based on the follow-up scans. In the study of Lee et al. 2015 in 13 GEP-NET patients, a total of 
35 positive lesions were detected in 10 patients on either gallium (68Ga) edotreotide PET/CT or indium (111In) 
pentetreotide SPECT/CT while 3 patients did not exhibit any positive lesions on either imaging method. 
Gallium (68Ga) edotreotide detected 35/35 (100%) lesions vs 19/35=54% for indium (111In) pentetreotide 
SPECT/CT. In the study of Kowalski et al. 2003 in 4 patients with GEP-NET, gallium (68Ga) edotreotide 
showed better patient-based detection rate (100%) than indium (111In) pentetreotide (50%).  
The results provided comparing gallium (68Ga) edotreotide with Octreoscan have some drawbacks related to 
the limited number of patients included in the publications (as expected for a rare disease), the use of the 
ideal comparator (Octreoscan) only in a limited number of studies, and the assessment based on lesions 
rather on patients in some publications. However, the overall efficacy data, including the results from the 
meta-analysis, are consistent where gallium (68Ga) edotreotide detects more primary and/or metastatic GEP-
NET lesions than Octreoscan. The applicant has not provided data of impact on diagnostic thinking (higher 
probability of correct diagnosis after the test than before the test, or change in diagnosis) for gallium (68Ga) 
edotreotide. Data available on the impact of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide on patient management are limited. 
Frilling et al. analysed the added value of 68Ga-edotreotide PET/CT in diagnostic algorithm of 52 patients with 
NET (Frilling 2010). The examinations were performed in terms of tumour staging and, in some instances, 
also of primary tumour site identification to evaluate the patient’s eligibility for different types of treatment.

In each patient, the CT and/or MRI were performed and consecutively underwent 68Ga-edotreotide PET/CT. In 
all 52 patients, 68Ga-edotreotide PET/CT demonstrated pathologically increased uptake for at least 1 tumour 
site, yielding a patient based sensitivity of 100%. In 3 of 4 patients with unknown primary tumour site, 68Ga-
edotreotide PET/CT visualised the primary tumour region (jejunum, ileum, and pancreas, respectively) not 
identified on CT and/or MRI.  68Ga-edotreotide PET/CT detected additional hepatic and/or extrahepatic 
metastases in 22 of the 33 patients diagnosed with hepatic metastases on CT and/or MRI. Of the 15 patients 
evaluated for liver transplantation, 7/15=46.6% were omitted from further screening because of evidence of 
metastatic lesions not seen by conventional imaging. Overall, 68Ga-edotreotide PET/CT impacted the 
treatment decisions based on CT and/or MRI alone, in 31/52 patients =59.6%. 
In the study of Gabriel et al. 68Ga-edotreotide PET provided further clinically relevant information in 
comparison with diagnostic CT alone in 18/84=21.4% of patients in different clinical situations of NET 
(Gabriel 2007). Compared with SRS with 99mTc-HYNIC-TOC or 111In-edotreotide, 68Ga-edotreotide PET 
provided further valuable clinical information (impact on diagnostic thinking) in 12/84=14.3% of patients. 
Finally, in 21/84=25% of patients with NET, Surgical intervention was omitted in 3 patients because 
widespread disease was detected by 68Ga-edotreotide, showing additional unknown distant tumour lesions. 
Similar results were obtained in the study of Froeling et al. who evaluated the impact of 68Ga-edotreotide 
PET/CT on diagnosis and therapeutic management of 21 patients with MEN (Froeling 2012). The impact of 
68Ga-edotreotide PET/CT on diagnosis and therapeutic management of patients were assessed by the records 
of the interdisciplinary NET tumour board including histological findings, clinical and radiological follow-up. It 
was observed in 10/21 (47.6%) MEN patients. The author concluded that 68Ga-edotreotide PET/CT allows a 
high detection rate of NET lesions in the context of MEN-1 syndrome as well as influence therapeutic 
management in nearly up to half of the patients.  68Ga-edotreotide PET/ CT should include a CE- CT to 
improve MEN-associated NET lesion detection. 
A retrospective evaluation of impact of 68Ga-edotreotide PET/CT (including triple-phase CE CT) in 64/66 
patients with known or suspected was performed by Ruf et al. (Ruf 2010). An impact on therapeutic 
management was observed in 24/64=38% of NET patients: primary resection (n=5), curative lymph node 
resection (n=1), initiation/switch of chemotherapy (CTx) due to progressive disease (n=10), no surgery due 
to systemic disease (n=2), PRRT instead of CTx (n=1), additional bisphosphonate therapy (n=4), and hepatic 
brachytherapy (n=1). In 12/24=50% of these patients, relevant findings were detected by a single 
submodality only: CT (n=5), PET (n=7); (p=0.774). 
The impact of whole-body PET/CT and MRI imaging on the treatment decision was evaluated by an 
interdisciplinary tumour board (Schraml 2013). The imaging results impacted the treatment decision in 30/51 
patients=59% with comparable information from PET/CT and wbMRI in 30 patients, additional relevant 
information from PET/CT in 16 patients and from wbMRI in 7 patients. 
Solid  tumours  represent  a  highly  heterogeneous  group  of  cells  with  different  susceptibility  to anti-cancer 
therapy  where  malignant  cells  survive  by  activation  of  multiple  oncogenic  pathways,  including  the 
phenotypic transformation.  This  becomes  even  more  evident  in  patients  with advanced  disease  and  history 
of  multiple  drug-resistance.  Within  this  context  of  advanced  stage  disease  (metastatic  NET)  where 
detection  rate  becomes  less  critical,  a  positive  impact  of  68Ga-edotreotide  PET  imaging  (over  111In-
pentetreotide  SPECT)  on  patient  management  has  been  observed.  In  two  studies  (Buchmann  et  al. 
2007;  Van  Binnebeek  et  al.  2015)  the  pooled  impact  rate  of  68Ga-edotreotide  PET/CT  on  this  category  of 
patients was 8/80=10%. 
Errors in PET findings interpretation have been included as potential important risks in the RMP.

The proposed dose and time window of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide scan PET images have been justified and 
are based on the 2010 Procedure guidelines forPET/CTtumour imaging with 68Ga-DOTA-conjugated peptides 
of the European association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) (Virgolini et al. 2010) and some published papers.  
Based on the clinical efficacy data of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide presented, the wording of the indication was 
modified as follows: 
“This medicinal product is for diagnostic use only. 
After radiolabelling with gallium (68Ga) chloride solution, the solution of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide obtained is 
indicated for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging of somatostatin receptor overexpression in adult 
patients with confirmed or suspected well-differentiated gastro-enteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours 
(GEP-NET) for localizing primary tumours and their metastases.” 
The CHMP was not convinced that the efficacy data showed that 68Ga edotreotide demonstrated a clinical 
benefit at predicting and monitoring of therapeutic response to peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) 
in histologically confirmed metastatic NET. A statement has been included in section 5.1 of the SmPC to 
highlight to healthcare professionals that data supporting efficacy of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide for predicting 
and monitoring of therapeutic response to peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) in histologically 
confirmed metastatic NET are limited.  Five studies have been submitted, one of them prospective (Gabriel et 
al. 2009) and four retrospective studies (Kroiss et al. 2013, Ezziddin et al. 2012, Kratochwil et al. 2015 and 
Luboldt et al.2010a).  
In the study by Gabriel et al. 2009 pre-PRRT gallium (68Ga) edotreotide was compared with CT or MRI using 
the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Gallium (68Ga) edotreotide PET and CT showed a 
concordant result in 32 patients (70%) and discrepancies in 14 patients (30%) presenting 9 with progressive 
disease and 5 with remission. 
The retrospective study of Kroiss et al. 2013 in 249 NET patients showed that PRRT does not significantly 
influence semiquantitative uptake of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide PET, except in liver metastases of patients 
with NET, but the study lacked histological confirmation. The three remaining retrospective studies recruited 
small samples (ranging from 20 to 28 GEP-NET patientsor those with cancer of unknown origin) and found 
that semiquantitative uptake in the pre-PRRT gallium (68Ga) edotreotide PET scan correlated with the 
tumour-absorbed doses per injected activity of the subsequent first treatment cycle, differed between those 
lesions classified as responding and non-responding after three PRRT cycles, and helped to separate hepatic 
metastases from normal liver tissue. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide has not been established in paediatric populations, 
where the effective dose might be different than in adults. There is no recommendation for use of SomaKit 
TOC in paediatric patients. 
Method of administration  
SomaKit TOC is for intravenous use and for single use only. 
This medicinal product should be radiolabelled before administration to the patient. 
The activity of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide has to be measured with activimeter immediately prior to injection.  
The injection of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide must be administered intravenously in order to avoid irradiation as 
a result of local extravasation, as well as imaging artefacts.

For instructions on extemporaneous preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see sections 
6.6 and 12 of the SmPC. 
For patient preparation, see section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Image acquisition 
Radiolabelled SomaKit TOC is suitable for PET medical imaging. The acquisition must include a whole body 
acquisition from skull to mid-thigh. The recommended time for imaging is 40 to 90 minutes post-injection. 
Imaging acquisition start time and duration should be adapted according to the equipment used, the patient 
and the tumour characteristics in order to obtain the best image quality possible. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Technical and diagnostic performance of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide has been demonstrated in patients with 
GEP-NET in comparison versus the standard of truth (histology) and/or the appropriate comparator indium 
(In111) pentetreotide (Octreoscan). Data on impact of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide on diagnostic thinking was 
not provided and data available on the impact of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide on patient management are 
limited. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The patient population exposed to 68Ga-endotreotide from the published results of the clinical studies on 
efficacy and safety in the claimed indication of GEP-NET include 977 examinations performed in 970 patients.  
The safety data of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide were obtained from the available published data. 
In the study of safety and tolerability of SomaKit TOC (EudraCT# 2014-002741-21), the activity administered 
was 2 MBq/kg of body weight, but ranging between 100 and 200 MBq. 
Adverse events 
From available literature data, no adverse reaction related to gallium (68Ga) edotreotide has been reported so 
far, when used in the specified diagnostic dose range. There is, however, a hypothetical risk of 
hypersensitivity and adverse events related to exposure to ionising radiation (induction of cancer and 
potential of hereditary defects).  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
There was no serious adverse event reported in the published literature. 
There were no deaths reported in the published literature. 
There were no other significant events reported in the published literature.

Safety in special populations 
Liver and renal impairment 
Norenberg et al. (2006) assessed the acute toxicity of unlabelled and 213Bi-labelled edotreotide in CA20984 
tumour-bearing Lewis rats. While nephrotoxicity was described in the study of Norenberg, the data cannot be 
extrapolated to 68Ga as 213Bi is an alpha emitter and 68Ga is a beta+ emitter. Alpha emitters such as 213Bi, 
are known to cause nephrotoxicity. For 68Ga-labelled edotreotide, the dosimetric data and bibliographic data 
support the findings that no nephrotoxic effects of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide were observed. 
Paediatric population 
There were no data on the paediatric population reported from the published literature. 
Pregnancy 
There were no data on the administration of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide in pregnant women reported in the 
published literature. The risk of administration of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide is related to the estimation of 
radiation dose to the foetus. This assumption may be done from the following assumptions: 
• 
The absorbed dose for gallium (68Ga) edotreotide per unit of activity for uterus is 0.015 mGy/MBq 
(3mGy/200MBq)  and  the  effective  dose  after  administration  of  maximal  recommended  activity of 
gallium (68Ga) edotreotide of 200 MBq is 4.2 mSv (Sandstrom et al., 2013). 
•  With fludeoxuglucose (18F) (FDG), the use of which is not contraindicated during pregnancy, the 
absorbed  dose  per  unit  of  activity  for  uterus  is  0.018 mGy/MBq  (7.2  mGy/400MBq)  and  the 
effective  dose  after  administration  of  maximal  recommended  activity  of  FDG  of  400  MBq  is 7.6 
mSv (ICRP 106, Core SmPC FDG). 
Breastfeeding 
There were no data on the administration of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide in breastfeeding women reported in 
the published literature. For other PET agents such as  18-fluorinated  PET  radiopharmaceuticals,  the 
breastfeeding  and  the  close contact  with  infants  is  recommended  to  be  interrupted  during  12  hours 
following  their administration (=720 minutes, corresponding to 6.6 physical half-lives of 18F). 
Similarly, for 68Ga with a physical half-live of 68 minutes the breastfeeding and the close contact with infants 
are recommended to be interrupted during 68min x 6.6 = 449 minutes following its administration, 
corresponding to approximately 8 hours. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
There were no data on clinical drug interaction reported in the published literature.  
SST  receptors  expressed  by malignant cells  appear  not  to  be  saturable  by  exogenous  somatostatin 
analogues  (Velikyan  2010,  Sabet  2013,  Giesel  2013).  Furthermore,  the  results  of  Velikyan  et  al.  (2010), 
show  that  high  levels  (250  and  500  µg)  of  edotreotide  are  suboptimal  with  respect  to  tumour- 
background  ratio  (compared to lower levels of edotreotide).

There were no data on post marketing experience reported in the published literature. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
As this is an application based on well-established use, safety data of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide is presented 
from published studies. No pivotal study from the applicant has been performed. 
The extent of population exposure to gallium (68Ga) in the literature references provided amounts to 977 
examinations in 970 patients. Taking into account the rarity of GEP-NET, this number could be considered 
acceptable. 
No adverse reactions related to gallium (68Ga) edotreotide have been reported and hence, no important 
identified risks have been noted. Gallium (68Ga) edotreotide is generally well tolerated. There is only the risk 
of hypersensitivity and the adverse reactions due to occupational and inadvertent exposure to ionising 
radiation, which have been included in the RMP as important potential risks. Exposure to ionising radiation is 
linked with cancer induction and a potential for development of hereditary defects. As the effective dose is 
about 4.5 mSv when the maximal recommended activity of 200 MBq is administered, these adverse 
reactions are expected to occur with a low probability. This is in line with the safety profile of the competitor 
Octreoscan. Occupational and inadvertent exposure has been included as an important potential risk. 
Safety  of  the gallium (68Ga) edotreotide  solution  has  not  been the  subject  of  specific  clinical  studies  in 
special populations. Several published studies included elderly patients and no safety concern was reported in 
such subpopulation. In the paediatric population, the safety and efficacy of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide has not 
been established in paediatric populations, where the effective dose might be different than in adults (see 
SmPC section 4.4). This has been included in the RMP as an important potential risk. There is no 
recommendation for use of SomaKit TOC in paediatric patients. Use in paediatric population has been 
included as missing information. 
Taking into consideration that pregnancy is not a contraindication for the use of unlabelled “cold” 
somatostatin  analogues  which  are  administered  in  significantly  higher  amounts  than  present  in 
radiolabelled edotreotide for diagnostic PET imaging, the sole factor implicating the contraindication of this 
radiopharmaceutical would be the potential radiation exposure. No data are available regarding the use of 
this product during pregnancy. Radionuclide procedures carried out on pregnant women also involve radiation 
doses to the fœtus. Only essential investigations should therefore be carried out during pregnancy, when the 
likely benefit far exceeds the risk incurred by the mother and fœtus. 
When an administration of radiopharmaceuticals to a woman of childbearing potential is intended, it is 
important to determine whether or not she is pregnant. Any woman who has missed a period should be 
assumed to be pregnant until proven otherwise. If in doubt about her potential pregnancy (if the woman has 
missed a period, if the period is very irregular, etc.), alternative techniques not using ionizing radiation (if 
there are any) should be offered to the patient. 
Assessment report  
EMA/734748/2016 
Page 89/104 
  
  
Before administering radiopharmaceuticals to a mother who is breastfeeding, consideration should be given 
to the possibility of delaying the administration of radionuclide until the mother has ceased breastfeeding, 
and to what is the most appropriate choice of radiopharmaceuticals, bearing in mind the secretion of activity 
in breast milk. If the administration is considered necessary, breastfeeding should be interrupted for 8 hours 
and the expressed feeds discarded. Close contact with infants should be restricted during the initial 8 hours 
following injection. Use in lastation has been included as an important potential risk. 
The proposal by the applicant to interrupt breastfeeding for 8 hours post-injection was justified and this 
information was reflected in section 4.6 of the SmPC and has been included in the RMP as an important 
potential risk. 
No studies were conducted to assess the impact on fertility. Embryofoetal toxicity and impact on fertility has 
been included as an important potential risk. 
No studies were conducted to assess the impact on embryofoetal toxicity and impact on fertility. These have 
been included in the RMP as important potential risks.  
In patients with renal or hepatic impairment, it is proposed to use SomaKit TOC with careful consideration of 
the activity to be administered since an increased radiation exposure is possible in these patients (see SmPC 
section 4.4).  The use of Somakit TOC in patients with renal and hepatic impairment is included as missing 
information in the RMP. 
Gallium (68Ga) edotreotide has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
In the event of administration of a radiation overdose, the absorbed dose to the patient should be reduced 
where possible by increasing the elimination of the radionuclide from the body by reinforced hydration and by 
frequent micturition. It might be helpful to estimate the effective dose that was applied. 
It is contraindicated if patients have hypersensitivity to the active substance, to any of the excipients listed in 
section 6.1 or to any of the components of the labelled radiopharmaceutical. 
Potential for hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions 
Although no hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions have been reported, if hypersensitivity or anaphylactic 
reactions occur, the administration of the medicinal product must be discontinued immediately and 
intravenous treatment initiated, if necessary. To enable immediate action in emergencies, the necessary 
medicinal products and equipment such as endotracheal tube must be immediately available. Hypersensitivity 
is included as an important potential risk. 
Contraindications in the SmPC: Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to any of the excipients listed in 
section 6.1 or to any of the components of the labelled radiopharmaceutical. 
Potential for hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions 
If hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions occur, the administration of the medicinal product must be 
discontinued immediately and intravenous treatment initiated, if necessary. To enable immediate action in 
emergencies, the necessary medicinal products and equipment such as endotracheal tube must be 
immediately available. 
Individual benefit/risk justification 
Assessment report  
EMA/734748/2016 
Page 90/104 
  
  
 
 
For each patient, the radiation exposure must be justifiable by the likely benefit. The activity administered 
should in every case be as low as reasonably achievable to obtain the required diagnostic information. 
Patient preparation 
The patient should be well hydrated before the start of the examination and urged to void as often as 
possible, during the first hours after examination in order to reduce radiation. 
After the procedure 
Close contact with infants and pregnant women should be restricted during the first 8hours after 
administration. 
Specific warnings 
Depending on the time when you administer the injection, the content of sodium may in some cases be 
greater than 1 mmol. This should be taken into account in patient on low sodium diet.  
Due to the acidic pH of the radiolabelled gallium (68Ga) edotreotide solution, accidental extravasation may 
cause local irritation. In case of extravasation, the injection must be stopped, the site of injection must be 
changed and the affected area should be irrigated with sodium chloride solution. 
Precautions with respect to environmental hazard are in section 6.6 of the SmPC. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked 
to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 
For information on instructions for preparation of radiopharmaceuticals ( radiation safety, method of 
preparation and quality control, see section 12 of the SmPC. 
For information on incompatibilities, shelf-life, special precautions for storage and nature and contents of 
container and special equipment for use see section 6.2, 6.3, 6.4 and 6.5. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
No adverse reactions have been reported in the published literature with gallium (68Ga) edotretotide. 
However, given that this product is administered by injection and is radioactive, there is only the potential 
risk of hypersensitivity and adverse reactions related to the exposure to ionising radiation to the patient and 
healthcare professionals. This risk is minimised by the recommendations of product handling and preparation 
in the SmPC (section 12). The safety of gallium (68Ga) edotretotide appears to be acceptable.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.2 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, SomaKit TOC (edotreotide) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained 
in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Assessment report  
EMA/734748/2016 
Page 93/104 
  
  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
The application for a marketing authorisation of gallium (68Ga) edetreotide under a “well established use” 
legal basis has been justified by providing data  
1) on the extensive use of the medicinal product in the EU in clinical practice for at least 10 years,  
2) on its use in more than 1,000 patients in published European studies and 
 3) by demonstrating the interest in the community by including recommendations of its use in current 
clinical and procedural European guidelines in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with GEP-NETs. 
Benefits  
Beneficial effects 
In terms of technical performance, gallium (68Ga)-labelled edotreotide has the technical advantage versus 
Octreoscan for better spatial resolution, whole-body scanning in a short time, and the added value of fusion 
imaging using a PET/CT hybrid scanner. The gallium (68Ga) isotope has the advantage of being produced 
from a generator which is available in hospital departments without a cyclotron. For patients, the main 
advantage is through a shorter scanning time with less exposure to radiation  
The diagnostic performance of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide for the detection of the primary NET site in case of 
rising levels of a relevant biochemical tumour marker or in case of proven NET metastasis, was initially based 
on two prospective studies (Gabriel et al. 2007 and Frilling 2010). Gabriel's study obtained a patient-based 
sensitivity and specificity of 100% (4/4) and 89% (8/9) for gallium (68Ga) edotreotide PET, better the values 
when compared to SPECT with 99mTc-HYNIC-TOC and/or 111In-DOTATOC (40% and 89%, respectively). 
Frilling’s study used CT or MRI as comparators and detected that PET with gallium (68Ga) edotreotide 
visualized the primary tumour region in 75% of patients compared to 25% for the comparators. In a 
publication from Schreiter et al. 2014, the retrospective analysis showed that in an intra-individual 
comparative images from a subpopulation of 20 patients, gallium (68Ga) edotreotide localised the primary NET 
in 9/20 (45%) compared to Octreoscan in 2/20 (10%). Imaging with gallium (68Ga) edotreotide PET/CT was 
able to identify the primary tumour in 7/15=47% patients who had negative findings according to Octreoscan 
performed at the first examination. In two patients with a primary tumour detected by Octreoscan, gallium, 
(68Ga) edotreotide confirmed the result.  
For staging in previously untreated GEP-NET or restaging in post-therapeutic GEP-NET in whom recurrence 
was suspected during the follow-up, the applicant presented a number of studies. A head-to-head 
comparison versus Octreoscan was performed in 3 prospective studies for initial staging or re-staging. In all 
studies, data showed that gallium (68Ga) edotreotide is able to detect lesions better.  
Assessment report  
EMA/734748/2016 
Page 94/104 
  
  
Concerning the impact on patient management of (68Ga) edotreotide, it varied in the five studies from 14% 
to 59% (Schraml et al al. 2013, Frilling et al. 2010, Gabriel et al. 2007, Froeling et al. 2012 and Ruf 201088). 
However, given the high sensitivity and specificity, it is acknowledged that this should eventually translate 
into better staging of the disease as well as changes in the treatment modalities. Thus, the clinical benefit 
from the diagnostic agent gallium (68Ga) edotreotide is considered to be demonstrated. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Although there was a considerable number of publications submitted to support the use of gallium (68Ga) 
edotreotide in the claimed indication, the number of patients recruited in the studies was small and in many 
cases, they did not use the appropriate comparator (fludeoxyglucose (18F), endoscopic 
ultrasound/multidetector CT, whole body MRI and contrast-enhanced CT instead of Octreoscan), the analyses 
were lesion-based instead of patient-based and in some studies the analyses were retrospectively performed. 
Nevertheless, the overall data, including the meta-analysis, appear to be consistent and robust considering 
that this is an orphan disease, with few patients diagnosed every year in the EU.  
For predicting and monitoring of therapeutic response to peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) in 
histologically confirmed metastatic NET, there was a greater uncertainty with similar limitations identified in 
the studies provided (not the ideal comparator,  the small patient population and the retrospective 
assessment) and the lack of robust data to support the patient population. Therefore, the CHMP was not 
convinced by the data presented and was not in favour of the indication of the product in this population. 
Therefore, a recommendation has been included in the SmPC section 4.4 that data supporting efficacy of 
gallium (68Ga) edotreotide for predicting and monitoring of therapeutic response to peptide receptor 
radionuclide therapy (PRRT) in histologically confirmed metastatic NET are limited (see section 5.1 of the 
SmPC). 
Risks  
Unfavourable effects 
No adverse reactions have been published or described in the studies submitted. There are no important 
identified risks in the RMP. Gallium (68Ga) edotreotide appears to be well tolerated. The main potential risks 
are for hypersensitivity and exposure to ionising radiation, which are minimised through routine 
pharmacovigilance. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
There is missing information on the use of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide in renal and hepatic impaired patients. 
There is also a lack of data in breastfeeding, fertility and in paediatric patients. These are being monitored 
through routine pharmacovigilance.

Unfavourable Effects 
No specific effects have been reported in published literature.  
The main hypothetical risk remains hypersensitivity.  
The administration of radiopharmaceutical products implies exposure to ionising radiation increase which is linked 
with cancer induction and a potential for development of hereditary defects, with a very low probability for this 
particular product. 
Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The technical performance of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide has been demonstrated in GEP-NET lesions where no 
tumour/tumour uptake was better for gallium (68Ga) edotrotide than Octreoscan in all lesions previously seen 
by CT/MRI (Hofmann et al. 2011). The gallium (68Ga) edotreotide has several advantages over Octreoscan for 
the patient in terms of scanning timing, irradiation time, and also for physicians where it is produced from a 
generator and hence more readily available in hospital departments without a cyclotron. For diagnostic 
performance, a substantial number of publications have been provided and the results are positive in terms 
of sensitivity, specificity and lesion detection rate of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide PET. Overall, the data is 
positive and consistent where gallium (68Ga) edotreotide appears to detect more primary and/or metastatic 
GEP-NET lesions than Octreoscan. Data available on the impact of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide on patient 
management are limited. The safety data of (68Ga) edotreotide shows that it is well tolerated and acceptable 
with no major issues so far identified.

Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the benefit-risk assessment 
GEP-NET are relatively rare neoplasms with an increase incidence and consist of an heterogenous group of 
tumours. Many different imaging techniques are used to localize GEP-NETs and their metastases. Anatomic 
techniques (ultrasound, CT and MRI) are the primary imaging modalities used in the initial phase of the 
diagnostic workup. Besides localization, staging and restaging of primary and metastatic tumors, imaging 
with some radiopharmaceuticals allows for the functional characterization of lesions and the therapy selection 
with cold or radiolabelled somatostatin analogues.    
According to the Guideline on clinical evaluation of diagnostic agents (CPMP/EWP/1119/98/Rev 1) the simple 
visualisation of an anatomic structure, which does not confer benefits to the patient, is considered 
insufficient. In order to establish an indication for a diagnostic agent, it is necessary to demonstrate its 
benefit by assessing its technical performance (including procedural convenience), diagnostic performance, 
impact on diagnostic thinking, on patient management, and on clinical outcome, as well as its safety. 
Sensitivity and specificity of PET with gallium (68Ga)-labelled somatostatin analogs for the diagnostic work-up 
of GEP-NET are important to be established, and also in comparison with sensitivity and specificity of 
scintigraphy using Octreoscan. The impact on diagnostic thinking and on patient management of gallium 
(68Ga)-labelled somatostatin analogs is also of paramount importance as they refer to the impact of this 
radiopharmaceutical on clinical decisions. 
Gallium (68Ga) edotreotide was shown to be regularly used in the diagnostic work-up of patients with NET 
tumours, including GEP-NETs, for at least 10 years as a medicinal product in the European Union. The degree 
of scientific interest in the use of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide is reflected in the published scientific literature as 
well as its inclusion in the European consensus clinical and procedural guidelines for the diagnostic 
management of GEP-NET patients. 
The technical and diagnostic performance of gallium (68Ga) edotrotide has been demonstrated where the 
diagnostic agent has proven to be convenient for both patients and healthcare professionals with its high 
sensitivity, specificity and lesion detection rate. The applicant has not provided with data of impact on 
diagnostic thinking (higher probability of correct diagnosis after the test than before the test, or change in 
diagnosis) for gallium (68Ga) DOTATOC. Data available on the impact of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide on patient 
management of GEP-NET are limited. There are some limitations on the use of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide. An 
increase in somatostatin receptor density can exist in different pathological conditions (e.g. Cushing 
syndrome) and that, somatostatin receptors are present at baseline in different organs and cells of the body. 
Hence, the interpretation method of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide images should be visual while 
semiquantitative measurement is not recommended. In addition, data supporting efficacy of gallium (68Ga) 
edotreotide for predicting and monitoring of therapeutic response to peptide receptor radionuclide therapy 
(PRRT) in histologically confirmed metastatic NET are limited. Nevertheless, as GEP-NETs are neoplasms with 
increasing incidence, there is a need for new diagnostic tools such as gallium (68Ga) edotreotide with 
improved technical and diagnostic performance as compared to what is currently available to patients and 
physicians. 
Gallium (68Ga) DOTATOC seems to be well tolerated with no adverse reactions reported in the publications 
submitted. There is a potential risk of hypersensitivity and adverse reactions due to exposure to ionising

radiation but with a very low probability. This would be in line with the safety profile of the comparator 
Octreoscan.  
3.1.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Somakit TOC is positive in the indication for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging 
of somatostatin receptor overexpression in adult patients with confirmed or suspected well-differentiated 
gastro-enteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (GEP-NETs) for localizing primary tumours and their 
metastases. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
risk-benefit balance of Somakit TOC is favourable in the following indication: 
This medicinal product is for diagnostic use only. 
After radiolabelling with gallium (68Ga) chloride solution, the solution of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide obtained is 
indicated for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging of somatostatin receptor overexpression in adult 
patients with confirmed or suspected well-differentiated gastro-enteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours 
(GEP-NET) for localizing primary tumours and their metastases.  
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following

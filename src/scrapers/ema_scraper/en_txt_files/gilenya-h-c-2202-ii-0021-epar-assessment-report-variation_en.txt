Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/117/2013 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/117/2013 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Fingolimod,  a  sphingosine  1-phosphate  receptor  modulator  is  a  selective  immunosuppressant.  It  is 
metabolised  by  sphingosine  kinase  to  the  active  metabolite  fingolimod  phosphate.  Fingolimod 
phosphate,  binds  at  low  nanomolar  concentrations  to  sphingosine  1-phosphate  (S1P)  receptors  1,  3, 
and 4 located on lymphocytes, and readily crosses the blood-brain barrier to bind to S1P receptors 1, 
3, and 5 located on neural cells in the central nervous system. By acting as a functional antagonist of 
S1P  receptors  on  lymphocytes,  fingolimod  phosphate  blocks  the  capacity  of  lymphocytes  to  egress 
from lymph nodes, causing a redistribution, rather than depletion, of lymphocytes. This redistribution 
is  believed  to  reduce  the  infiltration  of  pathogenic  lymphocyte  cells  into  the  central  nervous  system, 
where they would be involved in nerve inflammation and nervous tissue damage.  
Fingolimod (Gilenya) was authorised in the European Union (EU) on 17 March 2011 for the treatment 
of multiple sclerosis (MS).The recommended dose  of Gilenya is one 0.5 mg capsule taken orally once 
daily.  As of May 2013, Gilenya has been approved in more than 70 countries worldwide. The approved 
wording for the indication in the EU is as follows: 
Gilenya is indicated as single disease modifying therapy in highly active relapsing remitting multiple 
sclerosis for the following adult patient groups: 
- 
Patients with high disease activity despite treatment with a beta-interferon. 
These patients may be defined as those who have failed to respond to a full and adequate course 
(normally at least one year of treatment) of beta-interferon. Patients should have had at least 1 
relapse in the previous year while on therapy, and have at least 9 T2-hyperintense lesions in 
cranial MRI or at least 1 Gadolinium-enhancing lesion. A “non-responder” could also be defined 
as a patient with an unchanged or increased relapse rate or ongoing severe relapses, as 
compared to the previous year. 
or 
- 
Patients with rapidly evolving severe relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis defined by 2 or more 
disabling relapses in one year, and with 1 or more Gadolinium enhancing lesions on brain MRI or 
a significant increase in T2 lesion load as compared to a previous recent MRI. 
Interferon-β (IFN-β) and glatiramer acetate (GA) were the currently approved first-line therapies in the 
EU  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  relapsing  MS  at  the  time  of  this  variation  submission.  Other 
treatments  available  for  relapsing  MS  include  oral  fingolimod,  administered  once  daily,  and 
natalizumab (Tysabri), administered via monthly intravenous infusions. These therapies offer improved 
efficacy  over  current  first-line  therapies  but  are  also  associated  with  some  risks  and  are  approved  as 
second-line  therapy  in  the  EU.  Additionally,  newer  MS  drugs,  dimethyl  fumarate  (Tecfidera), 
teriflunomide  (Aubagio)  and  alemtuzumab  (Lemtrada),  received  positive  opinions  by  the  CHMP 
recommending  the  granting  of  the  Marketing  Authorisation  for  their  use  in  broader  RRMS  population.

The  European  Commission  (EC)  Decisions  on  the  Marketing  Authorisation  were  issued  in  August  and 
September 2013 for Aubagio and Lemtrada, and January 2014 for Tecfidera.  
Available  data  indicate  that  the  IFN-β agents  and  GA  have  comparable  efficacy    (Cadavid  et  al  2007, 
Mikol et al 2007, Limmroth et al 2011), providing about a 30% to 35%  reduction in the relapse rate 
compared to placebo, and modest effect on slowing disability progression in patient with RRMS (Goodin 
et  al  2002).  In  the literature,  data  from  observational  studies indicate  that switching  from  a first-line 
DMT  to  another  DMT  (first-  or  second-line)  is  generally  beneficial  but  do  not  indicate  that  switching 
from GA to IFN-β would offer significant benefits over a switch from IFN-β to GA (Oreja-Guevara et al 
2009, Gajofatto et al 2009). According to expert opinion, the definitions of high disease activity despite 
treatment with IFN-β, would similarly apply to prior treatment with GA (Fazekas et al 2013). 
On this basis, the MAH applied for the following variation: 
Modification  of  the  indication  (section  4.1)  of  Gilenya  to  extend  the  patient  population  from  patients 
with high disease activity despite treatment with a beta-interferon to patients with high disease activity 
despite  treatment  with  a  disease  modifying  therapy  (DMT).  The  Package  Leaflet  was  proposed  to  be 
updated in accordance. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
An updated ERA was submitted to support this application at the CHMP request. As the target patient 
population remains those with highly-active disease, the exposure of fingolimod is not expected to be 
increased  substantially  according  to  the  proposed  indication  update.  Based  on  the  maximum 
recommended daily dose of 0.5 mg fingolimod and using the default market penetration factor of 1% 
given  in  the  current  ERA  guideline  (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00),  the  predicted  environmental 
concentration (PEC) is 0.0025 μg/L for fingolimod which maintains below the trigger value for  Phase II 
studies(< 0.01 μg/L). A risk for the environment is therefore not anticipated for fingolimod. 
2.3.  Clinical efficacy 
No  new  efficacy  data  have  been  submitted  in  this  application.  Additional  efficacy  post-hoc  analyses 
have  been  performed  by  the  MAH  to  support  the  proposed  modification  of  the  indication  using  data 
from  phase  III  completed  studies  D2301,  D2302  and  D2309.  D2301  and  D2302  studies  were 
previously submitted as part of the initial MAA dossier. D2309 study was submitted as part of a post-
authorisation measure (FUM 9). 
2.3.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Phase III studies used for the efficacy analyses are presented in Table 1. 
Assessment report  
EMA/195551/2014  
Page 6/48 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 1. Overview of the clinical studies 
For efficacy analyses, the following 4 populations were defined from the Phase III placebo- and active-
controlled studies: 1) Pooled data from Studies D2301 and D2309, 2) Data from Study D2301,3) Data 
from  Study  D2309  and  4)  Data  from  Study  D2302.  According  to  the  MAH,  given  the  similar  trial 
designs  of  studies  D2301  and  D2309  (2-year  placebo-controlled),  these  2  studies  were  pooled  for 
efficacy  analyses.  Hence  this  allows  for  a  meta-analysis  model  for  pooling  Studies  D2301  and  D2309 
with  study  and  treatment  as  fixed  effects.  Study  D2302  utilised  a  different  design  (1-year,  IFN-β1a 
active-controlled)  and  was  analyzed  separately  to  provide  supportive  evidence.  For  individual  Studies 
D2301 and 2309, only summary statistics and/or frequencies were provided. 
Subpopulation definitions 
Four subpopulations were defined for those patients who were previously treated with GA and for those 
previously  treated  with  IFN  for  evaluation  of  efficacy:  1)  Patients  previously  treated  with  GA  at  any 
time (Group  GA), 2) Patients previously treated with GA in the 1 year prior to Screening, defined as 
those  who  were  on  GA  at  any  time  during  the  year  prior  to  the  Screening  visit  (Group  GA1),  3) 
Patients previously treated with IFN at any time (Group  IFN) and 4) Patients previously treated with 
IFN in the 1 year prior to Screening, defined as those who were on any of the 3 IFN-β treatments at 
any time during the year prior to the Screening visit (Group IFN1). 
Subgroup definitions 
For the Group GA1 subpopulation, 2 key subgroups were defined: 1) GA failures (patients previously 
treated  with  GA  in  the  1  year  prior  to  Screening  with  relapse  in  the  year  before  Screening  and  with 
either  at  least  1  Gd-enhancing  T1  lesion  or  at  least  9  T2  lesions  at  Baseline)  and  2)  GA  non-
responders (patients previously treated with GA in the 1 year prior to Screening with equal or more 
relapses in the year before Screening than in the previous year, ie, 2 years before Screening). 
Similarly, for the Group IFN1 subpopulation, 2 key subgroups were defined: 1) IFN failures (patients 
previously treated with IFN in the 1 year prior to Screening with relapse in the year before Screening 
and with either at least 1 Gd-enhancing T1 lesion or at least 9 T2 lesions at Baseline) and 2) IFN non-

responders  (patients previously treated with IFN in the 1 year prior to Screening with equal or more 
relapses in the year before Screening than in the previous year, ie, 2 years before Screening). 
In addition to these key subgroups, the following subgroups were also defined for  both  Group  GA1 
and  Group  IFN1:  1)  Combined  failures  and  non-responders  to  previous  GA/IFN  treatment:  patients 
fulfilling any or both of the definitions of failure or non-responder, 2) Patients previously treated with 
GA/IFN in the 1 year  prior to Screening with relapse in the year before Screening and at least 1 Gd-
enhancing T1 lesion or a T2 lesion volume ≥ 0.5 mL at Baseline, 3) Patients with ≤ 2 relapses during 
the  past  2  years  prior  to  Screening,  4)  Patients  with  ≥  3  relapses  during  the  past  2  years  prior  to 
Screening, 5) Patients previously treated with GA/IFN in the 1 year prior to Screening with a baseline 
EDSS score of 0 and 6) Patients previously treated with GA/IFN in the 1 year prior to Screening with a 
baseline EDSS score >0. 
Efficacy variables 
These were as follows: 
• ARR (confirmed relapses only) up to Month 12 and 24 (pooled Studies D2301/D2309, Study D2301, 
and Study D2309) and ARR (confirmed relapses only) up to Month 12 (Study D2302)

•  Number  of  Gd-enhancing  T1  lesions  at  Month  24  (pooled  Studies  D2301/D2309,  Study  D2301,  and 
Study D2309) and number of Gd-enhancing T1 lesions at Month 12 (Study D2302) 
•  Total  volume  of  Gd-enhancing  T1  lesions  at  Month  24  (pooled  Studies  D2301/D2309,Study  D2301, 
and Study D2309) and total volume of Gd-enhancing T1 lesions at Month12 (Study D2302) 
• Number of new/newly enlarged T2 lesions at Month 24 (pooled Studies D2301/D2309,Study D2301, 
and Study D2309) and number of new/newly enlarged T2 lesions at Month12 (Study D2302) 
• Change and percent change from baseline in total volume of T2 lesions at Month 24 (pooled Studies 
D2301/D2309, Study D2301, and Study D2309) and change and percent change from baseline in total 
volume of T2 lesions at Month 12 (Study D2302) 
• Percent change from baseline in normalized brain volume at Month 24 (pooled StudiesD2301/D2309,

In the pooled studies D2301/D2309, the majority (68.6% and  74.5%) of patients in both Group GA1 
and  Group  IFN1  completed  the  study,  with  the  highest  percentage  (75.0%  and  83.1%)  in  the 
fingolimod 0.5 mg treatment groups. In both Group GA1 and Group IFN1, the most frequently reported 
reasons  for  discontinuation  were  withdrawal  of  consent  and  adverse  events  (AEs);  both  more 
frequently reported in the placebo groups than in the fingolimod 0.5 mg groups. For the subgroups of 
failures  and  non-responders,  the  percentage  of  patients  who  completed  the  study  was  similar  for 
Group GA1 (69.2% and 67.0%, respectively) and Group IFN1 (76.9% and 73.0%, respectively). As for 
the overall groups GA1 and IFN1, the highest percentages of patients who completed the study in the 
subgroups  of  failures  and  non-responders  were  in  the  fingolimod  0.5  mg  groups  (77.2%  and  84.2% 
respectively). The most frequently reported reasons for study discontinuation in both subgroups were 
withdrawal  of  consent  and  AEs,  with  AEs  more  frequently  reported  in  the  placebo  groups  than  in  the 
fingolimod 0.5 mg groups.  
Patient disposition for pooled studies D2301/D2309 is presented in Table 3.

Overall,  for  both  studies  D2301  and  D2309,  taken  individually,  patient  disposition  in  the 
subpopulations and subgroups was consistent with pooled Studies D2301/D2309. The main reasons for 
study  discontinuation  were  AEs,  patient  withdrawing  consent,  and  unsatisfactory  therapeutic  effect. 
Same  consistent  findings  were  observed  for  study  D2302.  It  is  noted  that  the  numbers  of  patients 
discontinuing  in  Group  GA1  compared  to  Group  IFN1  were  low,  making  difficult  comparison  between 
treatment groups and across populations.

2.3.2.2.  Baseline data 
Demographics  were  similar  across  subpopulations,  subgroups,  and  treatment  groups.  The  mean  age 
was approximately 39 years, there were notably more women (mean: 76.1 for group IFN1 and 77.7% 
in  group  GA1),  and  the  majority  of  patients  were  Caucasian  (88.6%  and  90.7%,  respectively);  these 
results  are  consistent  with  demographics  typically  seen  for  a  relapsing  MS  population.    Overall,  the 
duration  of  MS  since  first  symptom  and  the  baseline  EDSS  score  were  similar  across  subpopulations 
(Group GA1  and Group  IFN1), subgroups and treatment groups.  The mean  duration of MS was 9.82 
(7.473)  to  11.24  (7.344)  across  all  subgroups.  Mean  EDSS  score  was  2.46  (1.237)  to  2.89  (1.414). 
The mean number of relapses in the last 1 year tended to be higher in all treatment groups for both 
the  failure  and  non-responder  subgroups  in  Group  GA1  (1.5  to  1.8)  compared  to  Group  IFN1  (1.4  to 
1.6).  The  baseline  characteristics  were  similar  across  the  subgroups  and  treatment,  although  Group 
IFN1  was  slightly  more  active  than  Group  GA1.  The  proportion  of  patients  free  of  Gd-enhancing  T1 
lesions  tended  to  be  slightly  higher  in  Group  GA1  and  the  GA1  subgroups  of  failures  and  non-
responders  compared  to  Group  IFN1  and  Group  IFN1  subgroups  of  failures  and  non-responders.  The 
number of Gd-enhancing lesions was slightly higher in the Group IFN1 than in group GA1. 
Baseline data are presented in Tables 4, 5 and 6.

Overall, for both studies D2301 and D2309, taken individually, baseline data in the subpopulations and 
subgroups were consistent with pooled Studies D2301/D2309. Same consistent findings were observed 
for study D2302.  
2.3.2.3.  Efficacy results 
Results from the pooled studies are presented in Tables 7 to 13. 
Efficacy analysis from the pooled studies D2301/D2309 showed significant reductions for the ARR ratio 
for fingolimod 0.5 mg vs. placebo for both subgroups of failures and non-responders in Group IFN1 and 
in Group GA1, with the reduction slightly being larger in Group IFN1 than in Group GA1 (see Table 7). 
In  Group  GA1,  a  similar  relative  reduction  for  fingolimod  0.5  mg  vs.  placebo  was  observed  for 
subgroups  of  failures  (ARR  ratio:  0.518;  95%  CI:  0.306,  0.877;  p  =  0.014  ;  reduction  of  48%)  and 
non-responders  (ARR  ratio:  0.500;  95%  CI:  0.294,  0.850;  p  =  0.011;  reduction  of  50%).  In  Group 
IFN1,  a  slightly  greater  reduction  for  fingolimod  0.5  mg  vs.  placebo  was  observed  for  subgroups  of 
failures (ARR ratio: 0.437, 95% CI: 0.300, 0.637; p < 0.001; reduction of 56%) and non-responders 
(ARR ratio: 0.372; 95% CI: 0.255, 0.545; p < 0.001; reduction of 63%). Globally, the effects on ARR 
ratio  are  similar  in  GA1  and  IFN1  groups,  in  failures  and  non-responders  groups  and  similar  to  the 
overall  results.  In  addition,  an  increased  proportion  of  relapse-free  patients  was  observed  for 
fingolimod  0.5  mg  versus  placebo  for  both  subgroups  of  failures  and  non-responders  in  Group  IFN1 
and  Group  GA1  (see  Table  8),  although  statistical  significance  was  not  reached  in  GA1  subgroup 
(failure group: odds ratio= 1.93; 95% CI: 0.853, 4.378; p = 0.114 and non-responders  group: odds 
ratio= 2.10; 95% CI: 0.948, 4.635; p = 0.068) as opposed to INF1 group (failures group: odds ratio= 
2.62; 95% CI: 1.575, 4.345; p < 0.001 and non-responders group: odds ratio= 3.23; 95% CI: 1.946, 
5.363; p < 0.001).

Regarding disability parameters, the reduction in risk of 3-month disability progression up to month 24 
for  fingolimod  0.5  mg  compared  to  placebo  was  greater  for  Group  GA1  than  for  Group  IFN1  for  both 
subgroups of failures and non-responders (see Table 9). In Group GA1, treatment with fingolimod 0.5 
mg  resulted  in  a  reduction  in  risk  of  3-month  disability  progression  up  to  Month  24  compared  to 
placebo of 66.1% for failures (HR: 0.339, 95% CI: 0.138, 0.832) and 55.7% for non-responders (HR: 
0.443,  95%  CI:  0.193,  1.014).  In  Group  IFN1,  treatment  with  fingolimod  0.5  mg  resulted  in  a  small 
reduction  in  risk  of  3-  month  disability  progression  up  to  Month  24  compared  to  placebo  of  6.4%  for 
failures (HR: 0.936, 95% CI: 0.500, 1.754) and 15.4% for non-responders (HR: 0.846, 95% CI: 0.460, 
1.554).    Overall,  there  was  a  trend  towards  beneficial  effect  of  fingolimod  0.5  mg  on  3-  month 
disability progression in GA1 and IFN1 groups both in failures and non-responders; however statistical 
significance  is  only  reached  in  the  GA1  failures  subgroup.    A  reduction  of  the  risk  for  6-month 
confirmed  disability  progression  in  all  subgroups  and  the  reduction  for  fingolimod  0.5  mg  versus 
placebo  was  also  observed  and  almost  similar  in  both  subgroups  of  failures  and  non-responders  in 
group GA1 (33.8% and 39.6%) and in group IFN1  (44%). However, none of the comparison reaches 
statistical significance (see Table 10).

Regarding  the  change  from  baseline  in  volume  of  T2  lesions,  the  mean  change  from  baseline  was 
numerically lower  for  fingolimod  0.5  mg  compared  to  placebo  across  all  subgroups,  although  none  of 
these achieved statistical significance for any subgroup in a non-parametric analysis for the Group GA1. 
In  Group  IFN1,  treatment  with  fingolimod  0.5  mg  resulted  in  a  statistically  significant  reduction  from 
baseline  to Month  24  in the  volume  of  T2  lesions compared  to  placebo  for both  subgroups  of  failures 
and  non-  responders.  The  percent  change  from  baseline  in  the  volume  of  T2  lesions  was  statistically

2.3.3.  Discussion 
The efficacy post-hoc analyses of the individual studies D2301, D2302, D2309 based on the subgroup 
of  patients  either  treatment-naïve  or  previously-treated  with  glatiramer  acetate  or  interferon-beta, 
were already reviewed by the CHMP as part of the initial MAA and FUM 9. All of these studies showed 
lower  aggregate  ARRs    for  fingolimod  0.5  mg  when  compared  to  placebo  for  both  patients  with  or 
without  prior  MS  DMT  (either  treatment-naïve  or  previously-treated  with  glatiramer  acetate  or 
interferon-beta), and these findings were consistent with the overall results of each of the study, when 
analysed individually. In addition, in all treatment groups, previously-treated patients (with glatiramer 
acetate or interferon-beta) showed higher ARRs than treatment-naïve patients.  
The  new  post-hoc  efficacy  analysis  presented  in  this  application  relates  to  the  pooling  of  studies 
D2301/D2309. Description of the results is presented in 2.3.2. 
Overall, the presented results appeared to show beneficial effects of fingolimod 0.5 mg in the subgroup 
of patients previously treated with GA and these were found to be consistent with the effects observed 
in  the  overall  study  populations  and  with  those  patients  previously  treated  with  beta-interferon  and 
subsequently  treated  with  fingolimod.  However,  the  CHMP  noted  some  limitations  in  these  post-hoc 
analyses such as the relatively small number of patients previously treated with GA or IFN (which was 
further reduced when the MAH selected only those patients who were exposed to GA or IFN treatment 
during the last year prior to screening for the fingolimod trial), the overlap between treatment failures 
and  non-responders  definitions  making  these  subgroup  analyses  of  limited  relevance.  Prior  to 
concluding  on  the  presented  analyses,  a  number  of  concerns  were  raised  by  the  CHMP  regarding  the 
need to discuss on how the differences in the placebo group between GA1 and IFN1 subgroups could 
affect  the  interpretation  of  the  results  and  to  provide  information  regarding  treatment  duration  with 
IFN  or  GA  as  well  as  the  reasons  for  discontinuation  of  these  treatments  (e.g  lack  of  efficacy, 
tolerability issue).These concerns were adequately addressed by the MAH and therefore the CHMP was 
Assessment report  
EMA/195551/2014  
Page 23/48 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of the opinion that the benefit-risk profile of Gilenya in RRMS patients with high disease activity despite 
treatment with glatiramer acetate was favourable. 
Whilst concerns were initially raised regarding the absence of data in patients previously treated with 
other MS drugs that recently became available (e.g teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, alemtuzumab) or 
even  natalizumab,  the  CHMP  acknowledged  the  availability  of  new  treatment  alternatives  for  MS 
patients  with  efficacy  comparable  to  well-established  interferon  beta  or  glatiramer  acetate  (GA) 
therapies,  thus  possibly  broadening  the  options  for  neurologists  at  treatment  initiation  or  in  case  of 
treatment  failure.  According  to  the  MAH,  because  of  the  wording  of  the  indication  as  currently 
approved, MS patients with high disease activity while being treated with IFN or GA can be switched to 
any  approved  DMT  except  fingolimod,  a  switch  only  possible  for  those  failing  IFN  treatment.  In  the 
current situation, patients with high disease activity treated with new oral agents, Tecfidera (DMF) or 
Aubagio (teriflunomide), are not eligible for treatment with fingolimod (or natalizumab). Both products 
have demonstrated superiority to placebo but not to an active comparator. If these patients fail their 
prescribed  therapy  and  require  greater  efficacy,  they  must  undertake  an  additional  year  of  therapy 
with  IFN  (or  either  IFN  or  GA  for  natalizumab),  even  if  they  are  experiencing  the  effects  of  high  
disease activity before they could be prescribed fingolimod or natalizumab. However, there is currently 
no efficacy or safety data to support the clinical benefit of this mandatory step, while there is evidence 
that  ongoing  clinical  or  imaging  disease  activity  may  lead  to  irreversible  neurological  deficits  in  the 
long-term.  The  only  alternative  for  potentially  more  efficacious  treatment  for  these  patients  becomes 
de  facto  alemtuzumab  (which  has  also  demonstrated  superiority  to  an  active  comparator),  although 
there is similarly no efficacy or safety data to support this algorithm.  
Given  the  current  situation  and  the  available  therapeutic  options  in  clinical  practice,  the  CHMP 
considered  that  it  would  be  unreasonable  to  expect  separate  data  to  be  provided  in  patients  treated 
with  each  of  the  marketed  drugs.  Taking  into  consideration  the  different  mechanisms  of  action  of 
fingolimod,  teriflunomide  and  dimethyl  fumarate,  the  CHMP  was  of  the  view  that  there  was  a 
reasonable  scientific  plausibility  in  the  assumption  that  even  if  treatment  with  teriflunomide  and/or 
dimethyl  fumarate  failed  due  to  lack  of  efficacy,  the  treatment  with  fingolimod  would  be  effective.  In 
addition,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  possibility  to  introduce  potentially  more  effective  treatment 
earlier, without unnecessary testing of similar alternatives in terms of efficacy in a stepwise procedure, 
will be beneficial for patients. 
Therefore  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  proposed  change  of  the  indication  to  reflect  the  possible 
therapeutic options for Gilenya, could be acceptable, provided that amendments in section 4.1 of the 
SmPC are made in line with the CHMP recommendations. The final recommended wording by the CHMP 
is as follows: 
“Gilenya is indicated as single disease modifying therapy in highly active relapsing remitting multiple 
sclerosis for the following adult patient groups: 
- 
Patients with high disease activity despite treatment with at least one disease modifying therapy 
(for exceptions and information about washout periods see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
These patients may be defined as those who have failed to respond to a full and adequate course 
(normally at least one year of treatment) of at least one disease modifying therapy. Patients 
should have had at least 1 relapse in the previous year while on therapy, and have at least 9 T2-
hyperintense lesions in cranial MRI or at least 1 Gadolinium-enhancing lesion. A “non-responder” 
could also be defined as a patient with an unchanged or increased relapse rate or ongoing severe 
relapses, as compared to the previous year. 
Assessment report  
EMA/195551/2014  
Page 24/48 
 
 
 
 
or 
- 
Patients with rapidly evolving severe relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis defined by 2 or more 
disabling relapses in one year, and with 1 or more Gadolinium enhancing lesions on brain MRI or 
a significant increase in T2 lesion load as compared to a previous recent MRI.” 
The CHMP also recommended the MAH to submit a proposal for gathering additional data on the safety 
and efficacy of Gilenya treatment in MS patients who were previously treated with at least one DMT , 
including  teriflunomide,  dimethyl  fumarate,  alemtuzumab,  natalizumab.  This  proposal  was  submitted 
as part of the risk management plan and was considered acceptable by the PRAC/CHMP (see 2.5). 
2.3.4.  Conclusions 
On the basis of the available data, the CHMP concluded that the proposed change in the wording of the 
indication (section 4.1) were acceptable. 
2.4.  Clinical safety 
The  safety  profile  for  fingolimod  0.5  mg  has  been  characterized  during  the  Phase  III  program  and  in 
the post marketing setting since its launch, including over 63,000 MS patients who have been exposed 
to fingolimod for a total of more than 73,000 patient-years as of DLP of February 2013. To support the 
proposed modification of the indication, the MAH presented safety analysis using the same studies as 
for  the  efficacy  analysis  (D2301,  D2309,  D2301).  Study  D2316  was  also  included  in  the  analysis  to 
support the safety profile of fingolimod in the extended population applied for.

In  study  2316,  adverse  events  were  reported  in  331  of  438  patients  (75.6%)  in  Group  GA1,  which 
could be possibly related to the shorter treatment period of 16 weeks compared to the other analysed 
studies. The highest incidence of patients with AEs was reported in the SOC infections and infestations, 
with  36.5%  of  patents  in  Group  GA1.  The  preferred  terms  with  the  highest  incidence  were 
nasopharyngitis  (14.6%)  and  influenza  (4.1%).  Nervous  system  disorders  were  reported  in  25.3%  of 
patients,  with  11.6%  reporting  headache.  Other  commonly  reported  AEs  (preferred  terms)  were 
fatigue in 9.4% of patients and lymphopenia in 7.1% of patients.

Six  deaths  were  reported  during  the  study  periods  presented  in  this  submission.  Three    deaths  were 
reported  in  study  2301,    1  patient  in  the  fingolimod  1.25  mg  treatment  arm  and  2  patients  in  the 
placebo  arm,  none  of  these  patients  were  included  in  any  of  the  subpopulations  based  on  prior 
treatment. One patient in the placebo arm died on Day 269 (65 days after last dose) in study D2309. 
Two  deaths  were  reported,  both  in  the  fingolimod  1.25  mg  arm  in  study  D2302.  One  patient  was 
included  in  Group  IFN1.  This  death  occurred  more  than  60  days  after  last  study  dose,  and  was 
attributed  to  Herpes  simplex  encephalitis,  which  began  during  study  treatment  following  a  course  of 
high-dose corticosteroids for an MS relapse and was complicated by a delay in antiviral treatment. Two 
additional  patient  deaths  were  reported  after  the  database  lock.  In  study  D2316,  one  death  was 
reported in the fingolimod 0.5 mg arm of this single-arm study in a patient that was not included in the 
subpopulation presented. 
2.4.2.4.  Laboratory findings 
Results  of  laboratory  examinations  for  the  individual  subgroups  were not  included  in  this  submission. 
The  safety  evaluation  between  the  subgroups  is  limited  to  the  AE  analyses  which  were  considered 
acceptable  by  the  CHMP,  taking  into  account  that  clinically  significant  laboratory  abnormalities  would 
be reported as AEs by the investigator and discussed in 2.4.2.2.

In  study  2316,  AEs  resulting  in  study  drug  discontinuation  were  reported  in  a  similar  proportion  of 
patients in Group GA1 and the overall population, with the highest incidence in the investigations SOC 
due to liver enzyme abnormalities. 
2.4.2.7.  Additional data 
During the evaluation, the MAH presented additional data on switching from natalizumab to fingolimod 
from  post-marketing  experience  and  clinical  trial  (study  D2324).  According  to  the  MAH,  about  10  to 
15%  of  all  fingolimod-treated  patients  had  previously  been  treated  and  switched  from  natalizumab. 
The  post-marketing  data  did  not  show  any  increased  reporting  of  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs)  in 
patients  who  switched  from  natalizumab  to  fingolimod.  In  particular,  there  is  no  pattern  of  any 
increase for any type of potential opportunistic infections with the exception of Progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy (PML). Few patients were reported with PML within the first months of switching 
from  natalizumab  to  fingolimod,  during  fingolimod  treatment.  These  cases  of  PML  were  attributed  to 
previous natalizumab treatment. 
Study  D2324  investigated  disease  control  and  safety  in  patients  switching  from  natalizumab  to 
fingolimod after different washout periods (8, 12, and 16 weeks). Although the study was terminated 
Assessment report

early (n = 142 instead of n = 600) based on the publication of data after the start of this study, that 
addressed  the  return  of  MS  disease  after  stopping  the  treatment  with  natalizumab,  it  contains  useful 
information regarding the optimal interval of switching from natalizumab to fingolimod with respect to 
both  risk  of  disease  recurrence  (disease  control)  and  overall  safety.  Switching  to  fingolimod  after  16 
weeks washout was associated with notably higher disease activity on MRI when compared to 8 to 12 
weeks  washout.  The  reported  results  did  not  demonstrate  substantial  difference  between  washout 
period  of  8  or  12  weeks  in  terms  of  efficacy  or  safety  parameters.  However,  patients  in  the  8  weeks 
washout  group  had  lower  mean  number  of  active  T2  lesions  (primary  objective;  8  weeks  –  1.9,  12 
weeks - 4.1 and 16 weeks – 7.7) when adjusted for the observational period. Similarly, changes in key 
secondary variables had tendency for a better outcome in a group with 8 weeks washout period. The 
mean  number  (SD)  of  active  (new  or  newly  enlarging)  T2  lesions,  adjusted  for  the  duration  of  the 
washout  period,  was  the  lowest  in  the  8  weeks  group  (0.4  [2.71]),  followed  by  the  12  weeks  group 
(2.1  [11.15])  and  the  highest  in  the  16  weeks  group  (3.6  [7.54]).  The  mean  number  (SD)  of  active 
(new or newly enlarging) T2 lesions during the first 8 weeks of fingolimod treatment was the lowest in 
the 8 weeks group (1.5 [4.56]), followed by the 12 weeks group (2.1 [5.50]) and the highest in the 16 
weeks  group  (4.2  [10.24]).  Overall,  the  least  MRI  activity  was  seen  in  patients  who  had  a  washout 
period of 8 weeks. More patients switching to fingolimod within less than 16 weeks remained relapse-
free. Most relapses occurred between 4 and 5 months after discontinuation of natalizumab. There were 
no  unusually  severe  relapses.  No  new  safety  or  tolerability  signals  emerged  from  this  study. 
Particularly,  there  was  no  difference  in  AE  profile,  SAE,  or  discontinuation  rates  between  the  various 
washout  groups.  The  infection  rates,  types  of  infections  and  severe  infections  did  not  notably  differ 
between  groups  and  there  were  no  differences  compared  to  the  established  safety  profile  of 
fingolimod. There was no difference across groups with respect to abnormal liver function tests (LFTs). 
There was no case of PML or death. 
Literature data (F. Rinaldi et al., 2012, MSJ, 18 (11) 1640-1643) also reported disease reactivation in 
11 out of 22 patients switched to fingolimod after 3 months washout period. 
2.4.3.  Discussion 
In  pooled  studies  D2301/D2309,  the  safety  data  reported  in  Groups  GA1  and  IFN1  were  generally 
consistent with the known fingolimod safety profile. The most commonly reported SOC were ‘infections 
and infestations’, ‘nervous system disorders’ and ‘gastro-intestinal disorders’. The overall incidence of 
patients  with  SAEs  was  low,  but  was    slightly  higher  in  patients  treated  with  fingolimod  0.5  mg 
compared  to  placebo  in  both  pooled  Group  GA1    (19.7%  vs    15.6%)  and  Group  IFN1  (12.9%  vs 
11.5%).  
The  incidence  of  SAEs  was  higher  in  Group  GA1  across  treatment  arms,  including  the  placebo  arm 
compared  to  Group  IFN1  and  the  overall  pooled  safety  population.  The  frequency  of  AEs  leading  to 
discontinuation  of  study  drug  was  low,  but  consistently  slightly  higher  in  patients  treated  with 
fingolimod  0.5  mg  compared  to  placebo  across  both  Groups  GA1  and  IFN1.  Similar  to  SAEs,  the 
incidence of AEs leading to study drug discontinuation was slightly higher across the fingolimod 0.5 mg 
and  placebo  arms  in  Group  GA1  compared  to  Group  IFN1.  Of  the  6  deaths  reported  for  the  studies 
included  in  this  application,  none  occurred  on  fingolimod  0.5  mg,  and  one  death  in  Group  IFN1  with 
fingolimod  1.25  mg  dose,  more  than  60  days  after  last  study  dose  was  attributed  to  Herpes  simplex 
encephalitis, which began during study participation.  
Some specific AEs that were reported  more commonly in MS patients treated with fingolimod 0.5 mg 
than in placebo-treated patients were: infections (nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, herpes infections), liver 
enzyme elevations (most often reported as increases in ALT and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT)), 
lymphopenia,  hypertension,  respiratory  AEs  (primarily  driven  by  cough).  No  increases  in  neoplasms

(overall) were seen in the comparison of fingolimod 0.5 mg to placebo for Group GA1 or Group IFN1. 
No  cases  of  macular  edema  were  reported  in  fingolimod  0.5  mg  treated  patients  in  Group  GA1  or 
Group IFN1. There was an increase in the incidence of migraine with fingolimod 0.5 mg  compared to 
placebo  in  both  subpopulations,  which  was  more  pronounced  in  Group  IFN1,  however  at  a  lower 
incidence  overall  in  this  subpopulation  compared  to  Group  GA1.  Vascular  disorder  events  were  more 
frequent in patients treated with fingolimod 0.5 mg compared to placebo in both Group GA1 and Group 
IFN1.  This  was  primarily  driven  by  the  proportion  of  patients  reporting  hypertension,  a  known  side 
effect  of  fingolimod.  The  difference  was  more  pronounced  in  Group  GA1  due  to  a  considerably  lower 
incidence of hypertension in the placebo arm in GA1 (1.1%) than in Group IFN1 (5.1%). More cases of 
BCC (Basal Cell Carcinoma) were reported on fingolimod 0.5 mg (4 patients; 2.2%) than on placebo (1 
patient; 0.6%) in Group IFN1; in Group GA1 more cases of BCC were reported on placebo (3 patents; 
3.3%)  than  on  fingolimod  0.5  mg  (1  patient;  1.3%).  Non-BCC  skin  malignancies  were  rare  in  all 
subpopulations and were too infrequent to draw meaningful conclusions. 
Overall,  slight  increases  in  some  specific  AEs  were  observed  in  Group  IFN1  (lymphopenia,  headache, 
diarrhea)  and  in  Group  GA1  (cardiac  events  driven  by  higher  incidence  of  palpitation  AEs, 
hypertension,  nausea,  respiratory  disorders).  Isolated  seizure  events  were  reported  in  all  treatment 
arms  in  Group  GA1,  without  evidence  of  a  dose  response  or  a  particular  seizure  type  predominating. 
However  these  specific  AEs  are  consistent  with  the  known  safety  profile  of  fingolimod.  The  presented 
safety  analyses  did  not  suggest  any  clinically-relevant  differences  in  the  comparisons  of  Group  GA1 
and  Group  IFN1.  Rates  of  WBC  decrease  reported  as  AEs  overall  were  comparable  between  the 
fingolimod 0.5 mg arms in Groups IFN1 and GA1. Bradycardia was rarely reported (0-1 patient in the 
fingolimod 0.5 mg or placebo arms in Groups GA1 and IFN1). There were no reports of atrioventricular 
(AV) blocks in Group GA1, and only rare reports of first-degree AV block in Group IFN1 reported (2-3 
patients in the fingolimod 0.5 mg or placebo arms). 
As  mentioned  by  the  MAH,  for  study  D2302,  the  number  of  patients  in  Group  GA1  was  small.  There 
was  also  a  considerable  imbalance  in  the  number  of  patients  in  the  fingolimod  0.5  mg  and  IFN-β1a 
arms,  in  both  the  Group  GA1  and  IFN1  subpopulations,  making  difficult  the  interpretation  of  the 
analysis.  Nevertheless,  the  overall  findings  were  consistent  with  the  safety  data  from  the  pooled 
studies  and  therefore,  the  CHMP  considered  these  data  as  supportive  of  the  safety  profile  in  the 
analysed populations, ie patients previously treated with IFN and GA. 
As  compared  to  IFN  and  GA,  the  safety  profile  of  other  DMTs  (e.g  teriflunomide,  dimethyl  fumarate, 
alemtuzumab)  in  the  MS  population,  is  less  known  and  safety  information  regarding  switching  from 
another first line DMT is limited. During the evaluation, the MAH proposed to maintain their proposed 
indication by introducing different levels of risk minimisation regarding certain DMTs (e.g teriflunomide, 
alemtuzumab),  based  on  their  pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic  and  safety  profiles.  Because 
alemtuzumab has profound and prolonged immunosuppressive effects and the actual duration of these 
effects  is  unknown,  the  MAH  proposed  to  not  recommend  initiating  treatment  with  Gilenya  after 
alemtuzumab  unless  the  benefits  of  such  treatment  clearly  outweigh  the  risks  for  the  individual 
patient. This was considered acceptable by the CHMP. The CHMP also agreed that the additional data 
presented for the switching from natalizumab supported the existing SmPC warning in section 4.4 that 
concomitant  immune  effects,  could  occur  for  up  to  2-3 months  following  discontinuation  of 
natalizumab. For the other DMTs, the proposal for risk minimisations were also considered acceptable, 
provided amendments are made in section of the SmPC in line with the CHMP recommendations (see 
2.6). The CHMP also recommended the MAH to submit a proposal for gathering additional data on the 
safety and efficacy of Gilenya treatment in MS patients who were previously treated with at least one 
DMT including teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, alemtuzumab, natalizumab, prior to final conclusions 
are made on this variation. This proposal was submitted as part of the risk management plan and was 
considered acceptable by the PRAC/CHMP (see 2.5).

2.4.4.  Conclusions 
On  the  basis  of  the  available  data,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  the  proposed  warnings  (section  4.4)  to 
support the proposed change in the indication (section 4.1), were acceptable (see 2.6). 
2.4.5.  PSUR cycle  
The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application  and  following  the  update  of  the 
RMP (version 7.3), was of the opinion that the PSUR cycle should remain unchanged. 
2.5.  Risk management plan 
During  the  evaluation,  the  CHMP  agreed  with  the  introduction  of  different  levels  of  risk  minimisation 
regarding  certain  DMTs  (e.g  teriflunomide,  alemtuzumab)  as  discussed  in  detailed  above.  In  addition 
the CHMP requested the MAH to submit a proposal (e.g registry) for systematically gathering additional 
data on the safety and efficacy of Gilenya treatment in MS patients who were previously treated with 
at least one DMT including teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, alemtuzumab, natalizumab. 
Subsequently,  the  MAH  submitted  an  updated  RMP,  version  7.1  to  address  the  above 
recommendations. 
The CHMP received the following PRAC advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan. 
PRAC Advice 
Based on the PRAC review of the Risk Management Plan version 7.1 the PRAC considers by consensus 
that the risk management system for fingolimod (GILENYA) in the treatment of highly active relapsing 
remitting multiple sclerosis in  
• 
adult patients with high disease activity despite treatment with a beta-interferon disease modifying 
agent. These patients may be defined as those who have failed to respond to a full and adequate 
course (normally at least one year of treatment) of beta-interferon with a disease modifying agent. 
Patients should have had at least 1 relapse in the previous year while on therapy, and have at 
least 9 T2-hyperintense lesions in cranial MRI or at least 1 Gadolinium enhancing lesion. A “non-
responder” could also be defined as a patient with an unchanged or increased relapse rate or on-
going severe relapses, as compared to the previous year; 
or 
• 
adult patients with rapidly evolving severe relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis defined by 2 or 
more disabling relapses in one year, and with 1 or more Gadolinium enhancing lesions on brain 
MRI or a significant increase in T2 lesion load as compared to a previous recent MRI; 
is acceptable. The following point should be taken into account with the next update: 
• 
The MAH proposed as additional pharmacovigilance studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
Gilenya in patients switching from other disease modifying agents to amend the protocol for the 
on-going post-authorisation safety study FTY720D2406. The MAH should submit an updated 
protocol taking into account the comments (amendment of inclusion criteria: patients switching 
from disease modifying therapies to fingolimod, study objectives, statistical analysis plan) together 
with sample size calculation based on assumptions regarding the number of patients expected in 
each newly defined group.

The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed post-
authorisation pharmacovigilance development plan is sufficient to identify and characterise the risks of 
the product. 
The PRAC also considered that the MAH should submit an updated protocol FTY720D2406 taking into 
account the comments (amendment of inclusion criteria: patients switching from disease modifying 
therapies to fingolimod, study objectives, statistical analysis plan) together with sample size calculation 
based on assumptions regarding the number of patients expected in each newly defined group. 
The PRAC also considered that the studies in the post-authorisation development plan are sufficient to 
monitor the effectiveness of the risk minimisation measures.

The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed risk 
minimisation measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed indication(s). 
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes and also recommended to include separate analyses 
according  to  the  type  of  therapy  previously  used  (teriflunomide,  dimethyl  fumarate,  alemtuzumab, 
natalizumab) in the updated protocol for study FTY720D2406.

In  addition,  the  MAH  proposed  to  upgrade  “hypersensitivity”  from  “potential”  to  “identified”  risk  to 
comply  with  the  latest  PRAC  recommendation  on  the  PSUR  (April  2014)  in  an  updated  version  7.3  of 
the RMP. The CHMP considered version 7.3 acceptable. 
2.6.  Update of the product information  
The  MAH  initially  proposed  the  following  changes  to  the  Product  Information  (new  text=underlined, 
deleted text= strikethrough): 
Summary of the Product Characteristics 
•  Section 4.1 
Gilenya  is  indicated  as  single  disease  modifying  therapy  in  highly  active  relapsing  remitting  multiple 
sclerosis for the following adult patient groups: 
-  Patients  with  high  disease  activity  despite  treatment  with  a  disease  modifying  therapy  beta-
interferon. 
These  patients  may  be  defined  as  those  who  have  failed  to  respond  to  a  full  and  adequate  course 
(normally  at  least  one  year  of  treatment)  of  a  disease  modifying  therapy  interferon.  Patients  should 
have had at least 1 relapse in the previous year while on therapy, and have at least 9 T2-hyperintense 
lesions  in  cranial  MRI  or  at  least  1  Gadolinium-enhancing  lesion.  A  “non-responder”  could  also  be 
defined  as  a  patient  with  an  unchanged  or  increased  relapse  rate  or  ongoing  severe  relapses,  as 
compared to the previous year. 
or 
-  Patients  with  rapidly  evolving  severe  relapsing  remitting  multiple  sclerosis  defined  by  2  or  more 
disabling  relapses  in  one  year,  and  with  1  or  more  Gadolinium  enhancing  lesions  on  brain  MRI  or  a 
significant increase in T2 lesion load as compared to a previous recent MRI. 
During  the  procedure,  the  MAH  proposed  to  introduce  different  levels  of  risk  minimisation  regarding 
certain  DMTs  (e.g  teriflunomide,  alemtuzumab),  based  on  their  pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic 
and safety profiles as discussed in detailed above, (new text=underlined, deleted text= strikethrough): 
•  Section 4.2 
Patients can switch directly from beta interferon or glatiramer acetate to Gilenya provided there are no 
signs of relevant treatment-related abnormalities, e.g. neutropenia. 
•  Section 4.4 
Prior treatment with immunosuppressants 
When switching patients from another disease modifying therapy to Gilenya, the half-life and mode of 
action  of  the  other  therapy  must  be  considered  in  order  to  avoid  an  additive  immune  effect  whilst  at 
the  same  time  minimising  the  risk  of  disease  reactivation.  A  CBC  is  recommended  prior  to  initiating 
Gilenya to ensure that immune effects of the previous therapy (i.e. cytopenia) have resolved. 
Gilenya can generally be started immediately after discontinuation of interferon, glatiramer acetate or 
dimethyl  fumarateto  Gilenya,  a  washout  is  not  necessary,  assuming  any  immune  effects  (i.e. 
cytopenia) of such therapies have resolved. 
Due  to  the  long  half-life  of  natalizumab,  elimination  usually  takes  concomitant  exposure,  and  thus 
concomitant immune effects, could occur for up to 2-3 months following discontinuationnatalizumab if 
Assessment report  
EMA/195551/2014  
Page 43/48 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Gilenya  was  immediately  started.  Therefore  caution  is  required  when  switching  patients  from 
natalizumab  to  Gilenya.  Teriflunomide  is  also  eliminated  slowly  from  the  plasma.  Without  an 
accelerated  elimination  procedure,  clearance  of  teriflunomide  from  plasma  can  take  from  several 
months up to 2 years. An accelerated elimination procedure is defined in the teriflunomide summary of 
product  characteristics.  Caution  regarding  potential  concomitant  immune  effects  is  required  when 
switching patients from natalizumab or teriflunomide to Gilenya. 
Alemtuzumab has profound and prolonged immunosuppressive effects. As the actual duration of these 
effects  is  unknown,  initiating  treatment  with  Gilenya  after  alemtuzumab  is  not  recommended  unless 
the benefits of such treatment clearly outweigh the risks for the individual patient.When switching from 
other  immunosuppressive  medications,  the  duration  and  mode  of  action  of  such  substances  must  be 
considered when initiating Gilenya to avoid additive immune suppressive effects. 
The CHMP, having considered the above, made the following recommendations: 
-  The  wording  of  the  indication  (section  4.1)  should  state  “despite  treatment  with  at  least  one  DMT 
therapy” because of the safety profile of Gilenya. 
- The deletion of section 4.2 is considered acceptable; 
- The MAH proposed to start treatment with fingolimod directly after dimethyl fumarate discontinuation 
based on a short half life of its active metabolite MMF. However, lymphocytes count in patients treated 
with dimethyl fumarate is decreased by <30% and increase of lymphocyte count is observed only four 
weeks after  stopping the  drug, albeit not returning to baseline levels. Having in mind that fingolimod 
also  reduces  lymphocytes  count  (reduction  to  20-30%  of  baseline)  though  likely  due  to  another 
mechanism,  it  would  be  recommended  to  reconsider  the  duration  of  washout  period.  The  duration  of 
washout  period  allowing  recovery  of  the  CBC  counts  might  be  appropriate.  Recommendations  should 
take  into  consideration  the  CBC  counts  following  discontinuation  of  dimethyl  fumarate  treatment  and 
prior to initation of fingolimod treatment; 
-  The  MAH  did  not  provide  clear  recommendations  for  the washout  period  for  teriflunomide  except  of 
pointing  to  very  long  elimination  period  (up  to  2  years).  In  MS  patients,  the  median  half  life  (t1/2z) 
was  approximately  19  days  after  repeated  doses  of  14  mg  of  teriflunomide.  If  a  decision  is  made  to 
stop  treatment  with  Aubagio,  during  the  interval  of  5  half-lives  (approximately  3.5  months  although 
may  be  longer  in  some  patients),  starting  other  therapies  will  result  in  concomitant  exposure  to 
Aubagio.  This  may  lead  to  an  additive  effect  on  the  immune  system  and  caution  is,  therefore, 
indicated, especially since fingolimod can even further reduce white blood cell counts. Having in mind 
that  pharmacodynamic  effects  of  teriflunomide  on  white  blood  cell  counts  (reduction  of  WBC  count 
<15%) might be even further exagerated if fingolimod is introduced within the period shorter than 3.5 
months  after  teriflunomide  discontinuation,  more  clear  recommendations  on  duration  of  washout 
period based on pharmacokinetic data as well as white blood cells counts should be made. 
The final wording recommended by the CHMP and agreed with the MAH for sections 4.1 and 4.4 is as 
follows: 
•  Section 4.1 
Gilenya  is  indicated  as  single  disease  modifying  therapy  in  highly  active  relapsing  remitting  multiple 
sclerosis for the following adult patient groups: 
Patients with high disease activity despite treatment with at least one disease modifying therapy (for 
exceptions and information about washout periods see sections 4.4 and 5.1).

have had at least 1 relapse in the previous year while on therapy, and have at least 9 T2-hyperintense 
lesions  in  cranial  MRI  or  at  least  1  Gadolinium-enhancing  lesion.  A  “non-responder”  could  also  be 
defined  as  a  patient  with  an  unchanged  or  increased  relapse  rate  or  ongoing  severe  relapses,  as 
compared to the previous year. 
or 
Patients  with  rapidly  evolving  severe  relapsing  remitting  multiple  sclerosis  defined  by  2  or  more

•  Section 4.4 
Infections 
[…] 
Before initiating treatment with Gilenya, a recent complete blood count (CBC) (i.e. within 6 months or 
after discontinuation of prior therapy) should be available. Assessments of CBC are also recommended 
periodically  during  treatment,  at  month 3  and  at  least  yearly  thereafter,  and  in  case  of  signs  of 
infection.  Absolute  lymphocyte  count  <0.2x109/l,  if  confirmed,  should  lead  to  treatment  interruption 
until  recovery,  because  in  clinical  studies,  fingolimod  treatment  was  interrupted  in  patients  with 
absolute lymphocyte count <0.2x109/l. 
[…] 
Prior treatment with immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapies 
There  have  been  no  studies  performed  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  Gilenya  when  switching 
patients from teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate or alemtuzumab treatment to Gilenya. When switching 
patients  from  another  disease  modifying  therapy  to  Gilenya,  the  half-life  and  mode  of  action  of  the 
other therapy must be considered in order to avoid an additive immune effect whilst at the same time 
minimising the risk of disease reactivation. A CBC is recommended prior to initiating Gilenya to ensure 
that immune effects of the previous therapy (i.e. cytopenia) have resolved. 
Gilenya can generally be started immediately after discontinuation of interferon or glatiramer acetate. 
For  dimethyl  fumarate,  the  washout  period  should  be  sufficient  for  CBC  to  recover  before  treatment 
with Gilenya is started. 
Due  to  the  long  half-life  of  natalizumab,  elimination  usually  takes  up  to  2-3 months  following 
discontinuation.  Teriflunomide  is  also  eliminated  slowly  from  the  plasma.  Without  an  accelerated 
elimination  procedure,  clearance  of  teriflunomide  from  plasma  can  take  from  several  months  up  to 
2 years.  An  accelerated  elimination  procedure  as  defined  in  the  teriflunomide  summary  of  product 
characteristics is recommended or alternatively washout period should not be shorter than 3.5 months. 
Caution  regarding  potential  concomitant  immune  effects  is  required  when  switching  patients  from 
natalizumab or teriflunomide to Gilenya. 
Alemtuzumab has profound and prolonged immunosuppressive effects. As the actual duration of these 
effects  is  unknown,  initiating  treatment  with  Gilenya  after  alemtuzumab  is  not  recommended  unless 
the benefits of such treatment clearly outweigh the risks for the individual patient.

Package Leaflet 
The  Package  Leaflet  initially  proposed  an  update  in  section  1  of  the  Package  Leaflet.  Following 
additional updates in section 4.4 of the SmPC, sections 2 and 3 were also amended in line with the 
SmPC. The final recommended wording by the CHMP is as follows: 
•  Section 1 
What Gilenya is used for 
Gilenya is used in adults to treat relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS), more specifically in: 
Patients who have failed to respond despite treatment with an MS treatment. 
or 
Patients who have rapidly evolving severe MS. 
Gilenya does not cure MS, but it helps to reduce the number of relapses and to slow down the 
progression of physical disabilities due to MS. 
•  Section 2 
Other medicines and Gilenya 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: 
•  Medicines that suppress or modulate the immune system, including other medicines 
used to treat MS, such as beta interferon, glatiramer acetate, natalizumab, mitoxantrone, 
teriflumomide, dimethyl fumarate or alemtuzumab. You must not use Gilenya together with 
such medicines as this could intensify the effect on the immune system (see also ‘Do not take 
Gilenya’). 
•  Section 3 
Your doctor may switch you directly from beta interferon, glatiramer acetate or dimethyl fumarate to 
Gilenya if there are no signs of abnormalities caused by your previous treatment. Your doctor may 
have to do a blood test in order to exclude such abnormalities. After stopping natalizumab you may 
have to wait for 2-3 months before starting treatment with Gilenya. To switch from teriflunomide, your 
doctor may advise you to wait for a certain time or to go through an accelerated elimination procedure. 
If you have been treated with alemtuzumab, a thorough evaluation and discussion with your doctor is 
required to decide if Gilenya is appropriate for you. 
3.  Benefit-risk balance 
3.1.1.  Beneficial effects 
Post-hoc analyses in patients previously treated with glatiramer acetate in the year prior to treatment 
with fingolimod showed beneficial effects of fingolimod 0.5 mg consistent with the effects of fingolimod 
in  the  overall  study  populations  and  with  those  patients  previously  treated  with  beta-interferon  and 
subsequently treated with fingolimod. 
In  pooled  studies  D2301/D2309,  post-hoc  results  showed  effects  in  favour  of  fingolimod  0.5  mg 
compared  to  placebo  in  all  subgroups  (failures  and  non-responders  patients  treated  with  glatiramer 
acetate  or  interferon-beta  at  any  time  in  the  year  prior  to  screening)  for  all  efficacy  variables  as 
measured by the ARR, proportion of relapse-free patients, disability and MRI parameters, although not 
all results were  statistically significant.

3.1.2.  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
No  efficacy  data  are  available  in  patients  previously  treated  with  other  DMTs  (e.g  teriflunomide, 
dimethyl  fumarate,  alemtuzumab,  or  even  natalizumab)  prior  to  fingolimod  0.5  mg,  and  under  the 
current conditions in clinical practice it would be unreasonable to request such data to be provided for 
all the available drugs on the market.  
In addition, limitations in the presented post-hoc analyses were noted (e.g inclusion of relatively small 
number of patients in treatment groups, overlap of the failures and non -responder definitions). 
3.2.  Risks 
3.2.1.  Unfavourable effects 
Although the number of patients included in the analysis was small, the safety profile of fingolimod in 
patients  previously  treated  with  glatiramer  acetate  is  similar  to  the  safety  profile  of  fingolimod  in 
patients  previously  treated  with  interferon  beta  and  generally  consistent  with  the  known  profile  of 
fingolimod. 
3.2.2.  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
No safety data are available in patients previously treated with other DMTs (e.g teriflunomide, dimethyl 
fumarate,  alemtuzumab)  prior  to  fingolimod  0.5  mg.  Given  the  long  lasting  immunosuppressant 
properties  of  these  MS  therapies,  this  raised  a  concern  on  the  possible  potentiation  of 
immunosuppressive  activities  when  switching  between  these  drugs,  and  for  that  reason  detailed 
recommendations,  on  how  this  should  be  done  in  clinical  practice,  were  introduced  in  the  SmPC.  The 
CHMP  recommended  different  levels  of  risk  minimisation  regarding  the  different  DMTs  (e.g 
teriflunomide,  alemtuzumab,  dimethyl  fumarate),  based  on  their  pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic 
and safety profiles. Such measures were considered adequate to ensure safe and effective use in the 
proposed indication. 
3.3.  Benefit-risk balance 
3.3.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The  efficacy  of  Gilenya  in  patients  switching  from  glatiramer  acetate  treatment  is  supported  by  the 
available  data.  No  new  safety  signal  emerged  and  the  overall  safety  profile  of  Gilenya  is  considered 
acceptable in this population. Due to safety concerns, Gilenya (fingolimod) was originally restricted to 
high  disease  activity  and  for  one  part  of  the  indication  after  failure  to  interferon-beta,  similarly  to 
Tysabri, and the indication of the latter has been updated to include RRMS patients with high disease 
activity who failed to respond to glatiramer acetate.  
Whilst concerns were initially raised regarding the absence of data in patients previously treated with 
other MS drugs that recently became available (e.g teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, alemtuzumab) or 
even  natalizumab,  the  CHMP  acknowledged  the  availability  of  new  treatment  alternatives  for  MS 
patients  with  efficacy  comparable  to  well-established  interferon  beta  or  glatiramer  acetate  (GA) 
therapies,  thus  possibly  broadening  the  options  for  neurologists  at  treatment  initiation  or  in  case  of 
treatment  failure.  The  CHMP  also  considered  that  given  the  current  situation  and  the  available 
therapeutic options in clinical practice, it would be unreasonable to expect separate data to be provided 
in  patients  treated  with  each  of  the  marketed  drugs.  Taking  into  consideration  the  different 
mechanisms  of  action  of  fingolimod,  teriflunomide  and  dimethyl  fumarate,  the  CHMP  was  of  the  view 
Assessment report  
EMA/195551/2014  
Page 47/48 
 
 
 
 
that  there  was  a  reasonable  scientific  plausibility  in  the  assumption  that  even  if  treatment  with 
teriflunomide  and/or  dimethyl  fumarate  failed  due  to  lack  of  efficacy,  the  treatment  with  fingolimod 
would be effective. In addition, the CHMP considered that the possibility to introduce potentially more 
effective treatment earlier, without unnecessary testing of similar alternatives in terms of efficacy in a 
stepwise  procedure,  will  be  beneficial  for  patients.  The  CHMP  therefore  concluded  that  the  currently 
approved wording of the indication was not reflecting the possible therapeutic options for Gilenya and 
should be amended accordingly. 
Additionally, as part of supplementary measures to ensure the effective and safe use of the product in 
the intended indication, data on the efficacy and safety of Gilenya treatment in MS patients who were 
previously  treated  with  at  least  one  DMT,  including  teriflunomide,  dimethyl  fumarate,  alemtuzumab, 
natalizumab, are to be collected as part of an ongoing long term study. 
3.3.2.  Benefit-risk balance 
The overall benefit-risk balance of Gilenya is positive for the following indication:  
 “Gilenya is indicated as single disease modifying therapy in highly active relapsing remitting multiple 
sclerosis for the following adult patient groups: 
- 
Patients with high disease activity despite treatment with at least one disease modifying therapy 
(for exceptions and information about washout periods see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
These patients may be defined as those who have failed to respond to a full and adequate course 
(normally at least one year of treatment) of at least one disease modifying therapy. Patients 
should have had at least 1 relapse in the previous year while on therapy, and have at least 9 T2-
hyperintense lesions in cranial MRI or at least 1 Gadolinium-enhancing lesion. A “non-responder” 
could also be defined as a patient with an unchanged or increased relapse rate or ongoing severe 
relapses, as compared to the previous year. 
or 
- 
Patients with rapidly evolving severe relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis defined by 2 or more 
disabling relapses in one year, and with 1 or more Gadolinium enhancing lesions on brain MRI or 
a significant increase in T2 lesion load as compared to a previous recent MRI.”

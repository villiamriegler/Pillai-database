1.  Introduction 
On 13/2/2023, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Fasenra, in accordance with Article 
46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
The MAH determined that the results of the study D3256C00001 (HILLIER) do not support the 
continued development of benralizumab for the indication of atopic dermatitis (AD), and for this reason 
the study was terminated after the primary analysis and results of the study are presented in the 
format of a synoptic clinical study report (CSR).  
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that study D3256C00001, titled “A Phase 2 Multinational, Randomized, Double-blind, 
Parallel group, 16-week Placebo-controlled Study with a 36–week Extension to Investigate the Use of 
Benralizumab for Patients with Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis Despite Treatment with Topical 
Medications (The HILLIER Study)” is a stand-alone study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
The dosage formulation corresponds to the marketed product, Benralizumab 30 mg/mL solution for 
injection in accessorized prefilled syringe (APFS) with 1 mL fill volume. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a synoptic clinical report for: 
Study D3256C00001, titled “A Phase 2 Multinational, Randomized, Double-blind, Parallel group, 16-
week Placebo-controlled Study with a 36–week Extension to Investigate the Use of Benralizumab for 
Patients with Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis Despite Treatment with Topical Medications (The 
HILLIER Study)”. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Clinical study number:  D3256C00001 
Title: “A Phase 2 Multinational, Randomized, Double-blind, Parallel group, 16-week Placebo-
controlled Study with a 36–week Extension to Investigate the Use of Benralizumab for Patients with 
Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis Despite Treatment with Topical Medications (The HILLIER 
Study)”. 
Description 
Benralizumab (MEDI-563) is a humanised, afucosylated, monoclonal antibody (immunoglobulin G1 
kappa) that binds to the human alpha chain of the IL-5 receptor, which is expressed on the surface of

eosinophils and basophils (Takatsu et al 1994, Toba et al 1999). Benralizumab depletes eosinophils 
and basophils by inducing apoptosis via enhanced antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity 
(Kolbeck et al 2010). 
Benralizumab is indicated as an add-on maintenance treatment in adult patients with severe 
eosinophilic asthma inadequately controlled despite high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting 
β-agonists. The recommended dose is 30 mg administered by subcutaneous (SC) injection every 4 
weeks (Q4W) for the first 3 doses, followed by every 8 weeks (Q8W) thereafter. 
Study D3256C00001 is submitted as part of the MAH’s investigation on the clinical utility of 
benralizumab across a range of indications involving eosinophil-driven pathology. Data from the 
approved severe asthma indication demonstrate that benralizumab 30 mg Q4W is safe and well 
tolerated among adolescent patients. 
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common chronic inflammatory skin disease, affecting between 2.1% 
and 4.9% of adults (Barbarot et al 2018), and up to 20% of children in some countries (Nutten 2015). 
Blood eosinophilia though variable in the general population of patients with AD, increases with disease 
severity, thereby supporting the eosinophilic nature of the disease (Jenerowicz et al 2007). Eosinophils 
are more likely to be present in acutely diseased skin samples than in chronically diseased samples. 
However, the markers of eosinophil activation and degradation (e.g., eosinophil peroxidase, major 
basic protein [MBP], eosinophil cationic protein and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin [EDN]), as revealed 
by immunofluorescence and eosinophil membrane disruption by electron microscopy, are prominent 
within AD skin samples providing further evidence of eosinophil involvement in the pathophysiology of 
AD. According to the rationale proposed by the MAH, this evidence for a role of eosinophils in the 
pathophysiology of AD suggests that a direct eosinophil-depleting approach, as provided by 
benralizumab, may prove beneficial in the treatment of AD by improving symptoms and AD-related 
quality of life.  
Methods 
Study D3256C00001 was a phase 2 multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group study to compare the efficacy and safety of benralizumab 30 mg monotherapy vs 
placebo in patients ≥ 12 years of age with moderate to severe AD who remain symptomatic despite 
treatment with standard of care treatment with topical medications. Benralizumab 30 mg was 
administered subcutaneously (SC) every 4 weeks (Q4W) for comparison with placebo for a period of 16 
weeks and identification of the appropriate maintenance dosing frequency (Q4W vs Q8W) during a 36-
week extension period. 
Study participants 
The target population consisted of male and female patients ≥ 12 years of age with moderate to severe 
AD who remained symptomatic despite standard of care treatment with topical medications. 
Inclusion Criteria:  
−  Physician-confirmed diagnosis of AD (according to American Academy of Dermatology 
Consensus Criteria) that was not adequately controlled with topical medications. 
−  Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score of ≥ 12 at screening and ≥ 16 at randomization. 
−  Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) score of ≥ 3 (on a scale of 0 to 4, in which 3 was

−  Documented recent history (within 6 months prior to screening) of inadequate response to 
treatment with topical medications, or participants for whom topical treatments were otherwise 
medically inadvisable (eg, because of important side effects or safety risks). 
−  Participants that had applied a stable dose of topical emollient (moisturizer) twice daily for ≥ 7 
consecutive days immediately before the randomization visit.   
−  Participants must have been willing and able to complete daily PRO (patient reported outcome) 
assessments: 
a) complete at least 70% of daily PRO assessments between Visit 1 and Visit 2 and 
b) complete at least 5 of 7 daily PRO assessments in the 7 days prior to Visit 2. 
−  Females of childbearing potential must agree to use a highly effective method of birth control 
(confirmed by the Investigator) from randomization, throughout the study duration, and within 
12 weeks after last dose of IP and have a negative serum pregnancy test result on Visit 1. 
−  Females not of childbearing potential 
Participants were excluded from the study if any of the following applied: 
−  medical conditions: active dermatological conditions other than AD, malignancies, active 
helminth parasitic infections, history of known immunodeficiency disorder incl. positive HIV 
test, active liver disease and other disorders that could affect the safety of the participant 
throughout the study, influence the findings of the studies and their interpretations or impede 
the participant’s ability to complete the entire duration of study. 
−  prior/concomitant therapy: AD treatment with TCS, TCI or topical PDE-4 inhibitors, initiation of 
AD treatment with prescription moisturizers or moisturizers containing specific additives, 
regular use of tanning booth or phototherapy for AD, use of immunosuppressive medication, 
known history of allergy or reaction to any component of the formulation. 
−  other criteria   
Treatments 
The study consisted of the following consecutive periods: 
•  A 1- to 4-week run-in period, including a 7-day washout period of topical medications prior to 
randomization. 
•  A 16-week placebo-controlled, double-blind treatment period. 
•  A 36-week blinded-to-dosing regimen extension period for maintenance treatment. 
Following the 1- to 4-week run-in period, patients were randomized in a ratio of 1:1:2 to one of the 
three treatment sequences: 
•  Benralizumab 30 mg Q4W until Week 16, followed by an extension period with benralizumab 
30 mg Q4W administered until Week 52  
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/183609/2023 
Page 5/23 
 
 
 
•  Benralizumab 30 mg Q4W until Week 16, followed by an extension period with benralizumab 
30 mg Q8W administered until Week 52  
• 
Placebo Q4W until Week 16, followed by an extension period with benralizumab 30 mg Q4W 
administered until Week 28, and then benralizumab 30 mg Q8W administered until Week 52. 
The general study design is summarized in Figure 2: 
The approved dosing regimen of benralizumab in severe asthma is 30 mg Q4W for the first 3 doses, 
followed by 30 mg Q8W thereafter. In adult and adolescent patients with severe asthma (SIROCCO 
[Bleecker et al 2016] and CALIMA [FitzGerald et al 2016]), treatment with benralizumab 30 mg Q8W 
and Q4W resulted in near complete blood eosinophil depletion for both the Q8W and Q4W dosing 
regimens. Since the PK/PD relationship of adolescents with asthma has been shown to be consistent 
with those of adults (SIROCCO and CALIMA) and given that PK/PD relationships are consistent across 
disease populations, the same benralizumab treatment regimen was administered to adults and 
adolescents in this study. 
Throughout the study, participants were required to maintain a stable regimen of their topical 
emollient (moisturizer) for AD. If medically necessary (ie, to control intolerable AD symptoms), rescue 
treatment for AD was to be provided to study participants at the discretion of the investigator.

Additional objectives (tertiary/exploratory) were also defined for comparison of benralizumab effect vs 
placebo on: healthcare resource utilization due to AD, patient-reported health-related quality of life 
measures, AD patients with comorbid asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, predictive 
value of baseline and early post dose biomarker data with clinical efficacy outcomes, the mechanism of 
action of benralizumab in AD and use of skin photography to inform clinical efficacy assessments in 
patients with AD. 
Sample size 
Approximately 270 participants were expected to be enrolled/screened to achieve at least 160, and a 
maximum of 200, eligible study participants randomly assigned to study intervention to ensure that a 
broad distribution of participants was recruited across the range of ages and blood eosinophil levels to 
allow potential identification of responding subpopulations and appropriate cut-offs for future studies, if 
necessary. The sample size calculations were based on the primary endpoint (proportion of patients 
with an IGA 0/1 and a decrease in IGA of ≥ 2 points relative to baseline). The calculations were 
associated with differences between benralizumab 30 mg Q4W and placebo at Week 16 during the 
initial double-blind, placebo-controlled phase of the study.  
For the primary analysis, the sample size calculation would power the study to detect a difference 
between benralizumab 30 mg Q4W and placebo in the overall population. Additional calculations have 
been provided to ensure that the study was adequately powered to detect treatment differences and 
consistency of effect in potential subgroups, should efficacy be limited to a subset of the population. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Randomization was stratified by baseline blood eosinophils (< 300 cells/μL; ≥ 300 cells/μL), and age 
(12 to < 18 years; ≥ 18 years) into the following strata: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
≥ 12 years to < 18 years and < 300 cells/μL 
≥ 12 years to < 18 years and ≥ 300 cells/μL 
≥ 18 years and < 300 cells/μL 
≥ 18 years and ≥ 300 cells/μL 
Neither the participant nor any of the Investigators or AstraZeneca staff involved in the treatment, 
clinical evaluation, and monitoring of the participants were aware of the treatment received. 
Blinded IP (benralizumab or placebo) was administered by SC injection at the investigational site Q4W 
for up to 48 weeks. Participants randomized to receive benralizumab Q8W in the extension period also 
received Q8W placebo injections at intervening visits (Figure 2) to maintain blinding to the 
benralizumab Q4W treatment regimen.

Statistical Methods 
The primary efficacy analyses were based on the double-blind, 16-week placebo-controlled treatment 
period. Available data from the extension period of the study up to Week 52 were also presented at the 
primary analysis. Efficacy endpoints were analysed using the Full Analysis Set; the analysis of safety 
endpoints was based on the Safety Analysis Set. Continuous variables were summarized using the 
following descriptive summary statistics: number of observations (n), mean, SD, SE, median, 
minimum, maximum value, and quartiles where more appropriate. 
For the primary Week 16 analyses of binary endpoints, after the use of rescue medication from Day 29 
onwards, participants were considered as non-responders from the point of the rescue medication use 
onwards. Any participants with missing visits (including data after withdrawal of study at any time) or 
missing Week 16 endpoint results were also considered as non-responders. For the primary Week 16 
analyses of continuous repeated measures endpoints, any data after the use of rescue medication from 
Day 29 onwards or after withdrawal from study at any time were treated as missing and the mixed 
model repeat measurements analyses fitted on the remaining available data. 
Intercurrent events were withdrawal from the study at any time or needing rescue therapy from Day 
29 onwards. However, participants who started on placebo and switched to benralizumab in the 
extension phase were additionally permitted rescue therapy for 28 days from starting benralizumab, 
and thus additionally any rescue therapy use from Day 141 (ie, 29 days after first dose of 
benralizumab) onwards was considered as an intercurrent event for these participants. 
Participants after withdrawal from the study at any time were considered as non-responders. Similarly, 
for change from baseline analyses, those intercurrent events were considered as missing data. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 244 participants were screened and 194 participants were randomized allocated at treatment 
groups as follows:  
Eighteen participants (9.3%) discontinued study treatment during the 16-week placebo-controlled 
treatment period, and 177 participants (91.2%) completed the 16-week placebo-controlled treatment 
period of the study (Table 14.1.1p).

A total of 175 participants (90.2%) entered the extension period, all but 1 of which received 
treatment.  
Participant disposition data from the 36-week extension period are shown in Table 14.1.1. A similar 
proportion of participants from benralizumab and placebo/benralizumab groups discontinued treatment 
in extension period. The most frequently reported reason for participant withdrawal was “withdrawal by 
subject” which was reported equally by both treatment groups. 
The study was terminated after the primary analysis and all ongoing participants were required to 
complete a final follow-up visit regardless of where they had reached in the extension period of the 
study. The final analysis was performed once all final follow-up visits were completed and included 
updated safety data presentations; no efficacy analyses were performed at the final analysis.

Recruitment 
48 study centres from 8 countries contributed the study participants. A total of 54.1% of all 
participants were enrolled in Europe, 20.1% in North America and 25.8% in the Rest of the World 
(table 14.1.7): 
The majority of participants were White (69.6%), followed by Asian (22.7%). 62.9% of patients were 
men and 37.1% were women with a mean age at screening, 29.6±15.90 years and the following age

distribution: 53 participants (27.3%) were between the age of ≥ 12 to < 18 years, 22 (11.3%) were 
between the age of ≥ 18 and < 21 years, 62 (32.0%) were between the age of ≥ 21 and < 35 years 
and 57 (29.4%) were ≥ 35 years of age.  
The mean weight, height, and BMI of all participants were 71.86±21.827 kg, 169.07±8.82 cm, and 
24.94±6.5 kg/m2 without differences between treatment groups. 
Baseline data 
The majority (56.2%) of patients in the placebo and benralizumab groups were diagnosed with AD 
before the age of 6 years old. The proportion of patients with a family history of AD was similar 
between treatment groups.  
49,5% of participants in any treatment group had been previously or currently diagnosed with allergy 
to airborne substances, 49% with Rhinitis, 41.2% with Food Allergies, 40.7% with Asthma, 20.1% with 
Conjunctivitis Allergic and 12.9% with Staph. aureus colonization. All other comorbidities were 
reported by <10% of participants. 
Participant baseline data (Full analysis set) for efficacy variables IGA score, EASI total score and Peak 
pruritus NRS were adequately balanced across treatment groups:

Stratification factors, baseline blood eosinophils (< 300 cells/μL; ≥ 300 cells/μL) and age (12 to < 18 
years; ≥ 18 years) recorded at randomization (IVRS) are summarized below:  
Participants had a history of the following disease-related medications (sorted in decreasing frequency 
of use) topical corticosteroids (87.1%), topical calcineurin inhibitors (44.3%), H1 antihistamines 
(29.9%) and systemic corticosteroids (23.7%).  
Numbers analysed 
The Full Analysis Set included all 194 randomized patients who received at least one dose of IP, 
irrespective of their protocol adherence and continued participation in the study. The analysis was 
performed according to their randomized treatment irrespective of whether they were prematurely 
discontinued. 
The Safety Analysis Set included all patients who received at least one dose of IP (194 patients). 
Erroneously treated participants were accounted for in the analysis set by assigning them to the 
treatment they actually received. A participant who received at least one dose of active IP was 
classified as active and included in the active IP treatment group/sequence. Safety and ADA data were 
based on this analysis set and for whom any post-dose data were available. 
Pharmacokinetic analysis set (143 patients) included all participants who received benralizumab and 
from whom PK blood samples were assumed not to be affected by factors such as protocol violations 
(eg. wrong dose) and who had at least one quantifiable serum PK observation post first dose. All PK 
summaries were based on this analysis set. 
The extension period analysis set included all participants who started or continued receiving at least 
one dose of benralizumab after the end of Week 16 placebo-controlled period, and thus entering the 
extension period (174 patients). 
The study was terminated after the primary analysis and all ongoing participants were required to 
complete a final follow-up visit regardless of where they had reached in the extension period of the 
study. The final analysis was performed once all final follow-up visits were completed and included only 
updated safety data presentations.

The primary analysis of efficacy results indicates that the primary endpoint of the study i.e., the 
proportion of participants with an investigator global assessment (IGA) 0/1 and a decrease in IGA of ≥ 
2 points at Week 16 relative to baseline, was not met.  
Additionally, there was no statistically significant difference in the effect of benralizumab compared to 
placebo on secondary endpoints. Of note, mean blood eosinophils had a greater decrease from 
baseline to Week 16 in the benralizumab group compared to placebo group and significant reductions 
in serum levels of eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN) were observed. 
Interpretation of the available efficacy data from the extension period of the study is limited on the 
grounds that no difference in efficacy outcomes between benralizumab and placebo were observed 
during the placebo-controlled period, and no placebo control was available beyond Week 16.

  A total of 3 participants (3.1%) reported severe AEs in the benralizumab groups: dermatitis 
atopic (2 participants [2.1%]) and dermatitis exfoliative generalized (1 participant [1.0%]). No 
severe AEs were reported for participants in the placebo group during this treatment period. All 
other AEs for participants in the benralizumab groups or placebo group were reported as mild 
or moderate in severity. 
  AEs assessed by the Investigator as possibly related to the study drug were reported for 6 
participants (6.3%) in the benralizumab groups (chills, dermatitis atopic, headache, injection 
site reaction, lymphadenopathy, and palpitations) and 8 participants (8.2%) in the placebo 
group (alopecia, chalazion, chest discomfort, diarrhoea, lymphadenopathy, seborrhoea, 
torticollis, and upper respiratory tract infection). 
  The most commonly reported AEs (> 5% in either group) were COVID-19 (benralizumab: 9 
participants [9.4%]; placebo: 4 participants [4.1%]), upper respiratory infection 
(benralizumab: 5 participants [5.2%]; placebo: 2 participants [2.0%]), and headache 
(benralizumab: 3 participants [3.1%]; placebo: 5 participants [5.1%]). All other individual AEs 
were reported in ≤ 5% of participants in either group. 
  One participant (1.0%) reported an injection site reaction of mild intensity in the benralizumab 
group. No other injection site reactions were reported for the benralizumab group or placebo 
group. 
  There were no clinically meaningful changes in mean values from baseline for haematology 
variables, clinical chemistry laboratory variables, or urinalysis variables within the 
benralizumab or placebo groups. Mean eosinophils had a greater decrease from baseline to 
Week 16 in the benralizumab group (Table 1).

36-week extension period (results from primary analysis): 
  A total of 46 participants (52.9%) in the benralizumab groups and 49 participants (56.3%) 
who had received placebo during the 16-week placebo-controlled treatment period reported 
AEs.  
  SAEs (Hodgkin’s disease, migraine) were reported for 2 participants (2.3%) who switched from 
placebo to benralizumab in the extension period. 
  No AEs with a fatal outcome were reported.  
  Seven participants (7.3%) who had received benralizumab and 6 participants (6.1%) who had 
received placebo during the 16-week placebo-controlled treatment period experienced AEs 
leading to discontinuation of study treatment at any point during the study, of which 3 
participants (3.4%) and 4 participants (4.6%), respectively, discontinued IP due to AEs during 
the extension period. 
  No participants in the benralizumab groups reported severe AEs. One participant (1.1%) who 
switched to benralizumab after receiving placebo reported a severe AE of Hodgkin’s disease. All 
other AEs were reported as mild or moderate in severity. 
  AEs considered by the Investigator to be possibly related to the study drug were reported for 8 
participants (9.2%) in the benralizumab group (fatigue, diarrhoea, eczema herpeticum, 
lymphadenopathy, neutropenia, oedema peripheral, thrombocytopenia, and upper respiratory 
tract infection) and 5 participants (5.7%) in the group of participants who switched to 
benralizumab after receiving placebo (chalazion, conjunctivitis, depression, herpes zoster, 
upper respiratory tract infection, and urticarial).

Serious Adverse Events  
The total number of participants with SAEs in the overall study (52 weeks), reported by SOC and PT, 
are shown in Table 14.3.4.1: 
Immunogenicity results (primary analysis)  
Anti-drug antibodies to benralizumab were summarized using descriptive statistics at each visit by 
treatment group based on the safety analysis set. 
−  ADA prevalence: At the time of the primary analysis, a total of 22.9% of participants in the 
benralizumab group and 8.2% of participants in the placebo group were ADA positive at any time 
during the 16-week treatment period. 
−  ADA incidence: At the time of the primary analysis, a total of 16.5% of participants in the 
benralizumab group and 3.4% of participants in the placebo group were ADA positive at any time 
during the 16-week treatment period.

ADA incidence is defined as ADA-negative at baseline and post-baseline ADA positive, or ADA positive at baseline 
and boosted the pre-existing titre by > 4-fold during the study period. 
−  ADA positive with maximum titre > median of maximum titres: At the time of the primary 
analysis, a total of 8.3% of participants in the benralizumab group and 4.1% of participants in the 
placebo group were ADA positive with maximum titre > median of maximum titres at any time 
during the 16-week treatment period.  
Calculation  of  the  median  of  maximum  titres  was  based  on  the  maximum  titre  for  each  ADA  positive  subject 
within each treatment group (incl. both baseline and post-baseline measurements). 
PK results (primary analysis) 
Serum benralizumab concentration were summarized using descriptive statistics at each visit by 
treatment group based on the PK analysis set.  
Within the benralizumab group, serum concentrations (geometric mean) were higher in ADA-negative 
participants at the end of the 16-week treatment period than in ADA-positive participants as shown in 
table 14.2.16.4:

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
This was a Phase 2 multinational, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, 16-week placebo-
controlled study with a 36-week extension. The main objective of the study was to compare the clinical 
efficacy of benralizumab 30 mg with placebo in the target population of AD patients who remained 
symptomatic despite treatment with topical medications. Secondary objectives included the 
comparison of the effect of benralizumab with placebo on supportive measures of clinical efficacy in the 
above target population. The choice of the primary endpoint (a binary response that classifies a 
participant’s skin clearance at Week 16 using the IGA score) is adequately documented: IGA is used 
for the evaluation of the overall inflammatory signs of AD (erythema, induration/papulation, 
lichenification, oozing/crusting) based on a 5-point scale (range from 0-clear to 4 severe). IGA is 
recommended by international guidelines to be used in clinical practice for the determination of disease 
activity and response to treatment. It has also been used in clinical trials for the registration of other 
products for the treatment of AD.  
The analysis of efficacy results provided solid evidence that benralizumab did not demonstrate clinical 
advantage over placebo in any of the primary or secondary efficacy endpoints, and no sub-population 
with clinically meaningful benralizumab efficacy was identified, despite the observed blood eosinophil 
depletion. The study was terminated by sponsor decision following primary analysis of the results from 
16-week placebo-controlled phase, which indicated that study participants were not benefiting from 
treatment. 
During the 16-week, placebo-controlled treatment period, in participants with moderate to severe AD 
who remained symptomatic despite treatment with standard of care treatment with topical 
medications, the safety and tolerability findings were consistent with the known profile of benralizumab 
and no new safety concerns were observed.

3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
Study D3256C00001 primary and key secondary endpoints were not met in the overall population, and 
there were no efficacy signals in subpopulations of interest. No safety concerns were raised. The 
submitted study does not influence the benefit risk for benralizumab and immediate revisions to the 
Summary of Product Characteristics are not warranted.

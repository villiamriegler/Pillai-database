CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Prophylaxis of influenza in children and adolescents from 24 months to less than 18 years of age.
The use of Fluenz Tetra should be based on official recommendations.
2
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Posology
Children and adolescents from 24 months:
0.2 ml (administered as 0.1 ml per nostril).
For children who have not previously been vaccinated against seasonal influenza, a second dose
should be given after an interval of at least 4 weeks.
Fluenz Tetra should not be used in infants and toddlers below 24 months of age because of safety 
concerns regarding increased rates of hospitalisation and wheezing in this population (see section 4.8).
Method of administration
Immunisation must be carried out by nasal administration.
Do not inject Fluenz Tetra.
Fluenz Tetra is administered as a divided dose in both nostrils. After administering half of the dose in 
one nostril, administer the other half of the dose in the other nostril immediately or shortly thereafter. 
The patient can breathe normally while the vaccine is being administered – there is no need to actively 
inhale or sniff.
See section 6.6 for administration instructions.
4.3 Contraindications
-
-
-
-
Hypersensitivity to the active substances, to any of the excipients listed in 
section 6.1 (e.g. gelatin), or to gentamicin (a possible trace residue). 
Severe allergic reaction (e.g. anaphylaxis) to eggs or to egg proteins (e.g. ovalbumin).
Children and adolescents with clinical immunodeficiency due to conditions or 
immunosuppressive therapy such as: acute and chronic leukaemias; lymphoma; 
symptomatic HIV infection; cellular immune deficiencies; and high-dose corticosteroids.
Fluenz Tetra is not contraindicated for use in individuals with asymptomatic HIV 
infection; or individuals who are receiving topical/inhaled corticosteroids or low-dose 
systemic corticosteroids or those receiving corticosteroids as replacement therapy, e.g. for 
adrenal insufficiency.
Children and adolescents younger than 18 years of age receiving salicylate therapy 
because of the association of Reye’s syndrome with salicylates and wild-type influenza 
infection.
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.
As with most vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily
available to manage an anaphylactic event or serious hypersensitivity event following the 
administration of Fluenz Tetra.
3
Fluenz Tetra should not be administered to children and adolescents with severe asthma or active 
wheezing because these individuals have not been adequately studied in clinical studies.
Vaccine recipients should be informed that Fluenz Tetra is an attenuated live virus vaccine and has the 
potential for transmission to immunocompromised contacts. Vaccine recipients should attempt to
avoid, whenever possible, close association with severely immunocompromised individuals (e.g. bone 
marrow transplant recipients requiring isolation) for 1-2 weeks following vaccination. Peak incidence 
of vaccine virus recovery occurred 2-3 days post-vaccination in Fluenz clinical studies. In 
circumstances where contact with severely immunocompromised individuals is unavoidable, the 
potential risk of transmission of the influenza vaccine virus should be weighed against the risk of 
acquiring and transmitting wild-type influenza virus.
Fluenz Tetra should under no circumstances be injected.
No data exist regarding the safety of intranasal administration of Fluenz Tetra in children with 
unrepaired craniofacial malformations.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Do not administer Fluenz Tetra to children and adolescents receiving salicylate therapy
(see section 4.3). Do not use salicylates in children and adolescents for 4 weeks after vaccination 
unless medically indicated as Reye’s syndrome has been reported following the use of salicylates 
during wild-type influenza infection.
The co-administration of trivalent Fluenz with the live attenuated vaccines: measles, mumps, rubella, 
varicella and orally-administered poliovirus has been studied. No clinically meaningful changes in 
immune responses to measles, mumps, varicella, orally-administered poliovirus or Fluenz have been 
observed. The immune response to rubella vaccine was significantly altered. However, this alteration
might not be of clinical relevance with the two dose immunisation schedule of the rubella vaccine. 
This observation with trivalent Fluenz is relevant to the use of Fluenz Tetra because Fluenz Tetra 
(influenza vaccine-liveattenuated, nasal) is identical to Fluenz with the only difference being the 
addition of a fourth strain (a second B strain) to Fluenz Tetra.
The co-administration of Fluenz Tetra with inactivated vaccines has not been studied.
The concurrent use of Fluenz Tetra with antiviral agents that are active against influenza A and/or B 
viruses has not been evaluated. However, based upon the potential for influenza antiviral agents to 
reduce the effectiveness of Fluenz Tetra, it is recommended not to administer the vaccine
until 48 hours after the cessation of influenza antiviral therapy. Administration of influenza antiviral 
agents within two weeks of vaccination may affect the response of the vaccine.
If influenza antiviral agents and Fluenz Tetra are administered concomitantly, revaccination should be 
considered based on clinical judgement.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
There is a moderate amount of data from the use of Fluenz Tetra in pregnant women. There was no 
evidence of significant maternal adverse outcomes in 138 pregnant women who had a record of 
receiving trivalent Fluenz in a US-based health insurance claims database.
In more than 300 case reports in the AstraZeneca safety database of vaccine administration to pregnant 
women, no unusual patterns of pregnancy complications or foetal outcomes were observed.
4
While animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive 
toxicity, and post-marketing data offer some reassurance in the event of inadvertent administration
of the vaccine, Fluenz Tetra is not recommended during pregnancy.
Breast-feeding
It is not known whether Fluenz Tetra is excreted in human milk. Therefore, as some viruses are 
excreted in human milk, Fluenz Tetra should not be used during breast-feeding.
Limited available evidence suggests that the trivalent Fluenz is not excreted in breastmilk. 
Fertility
No data exist regarding the possible effects of Fluenz Tetra on male and female fertility.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Fluenz Tetra has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
The safety experience with trivalent Fluenz is relevant to the use of Fluenz Tetra because Fluenz Tetra 
(influenza vaccine-live attenuated, nasal) is identical to Fluenz with the only difference being the 
addition of a fourth strain (a second B strain) to Fluenz Tetra.
Safety data regarding use of Fluenz Tetra are based on data from Fluenz Tetra clinical studies
in 2,231 children and adolescents 2 to 17 years of age, Fluenz clinical studies in over 29,000 children 
and adolescents 2 to 17 years of age and Fluenz post-authorisation safety studies in 
over 84,000 children and adolescents 2 to 17 years of age. Additional experience has occurred with 
marketed use of Fluenz.
In clinical studies, the safety profile of Fluenz Tetra was similar to the safety profile of Fluenz.
The most common adverse reaction observed in clinical studies was nasal congestion/rhinorrhoea.
List of adverse reactions
Adverse reaction frequencies are reported as:
Very common (≥1/10)

Paediatric population
In an active-controlled clinical study (MI-CP111), an increased rate of hospitalisations (for any cause) 
through 180 days after final vaccination dose was observed in infants and toddlers 6-11 months of age 
(6.1% Fluenz versus 2.6% injectable influenza vaccine). Most hospitalisations were due to 
gastrointestinal and respiratory tract infections and occurred more than 6 weeks post vaccination. The 
rate of hospitalisations was not increased in Fluenz recipients 12 months and older. In the same study, 
an increased rate of wheezing through 42 days was observed in infants and toddlers 6-23 months of 
age (5.9% Fluenz versus 3.8% injectable influenza vaccine). The rate of wheezing was not increased 
in Fluenz recipients 24 months and older. Fluenz Tetra is not indicated for use in infants and toddlers 
younger than 24 months (see section 4.2).
Very rare reports of Guillain-Barré syndrome and exacerbation of symptoms of Leigh syndrome 
(mitochondrial encephalomyopathy) have also been observed in the post-marketing setting 
with Fluenz.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. 
It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
Overdose with Fluenz Tetra is unlikely due to its presentation as a pre-filled sprayer. Administration 
of a higher than recommended dose of Fluenz Tetra was reported rarely and the adverse reaction 
profile was comparable to that observed with the recommended dose of Fluenz Tetra.
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Influenza vaccines, influenza live attenuated; ATC Code: J07BB03
Since 1985, two distinct lineages of influenza B viruses (Victoria and Yamagata) have circulated 
worldwide. Fluenz Tetra is a tetravalent vaccine that contains antigens for four influenza virus strains, 
an A/(H1N1) strain, an A/(H3N2) strain, and two B strains (one from each lineage). Fluenz Tetra is 
manufactured according to the same process as Fluenz. The influenza virus strains in Fluenz Tetra are 
(a) cold-adapted (ca); (b) temperature-sensitive (ts); and (c) attenuated (att). As a result, they replicate 
in the nasopharynx and induce protective immunity.
6
Clinical studies
Clinical experience with Fluenz is relevant to Fluenz Tetra because both vaccines are manufactured 
using the same process and have overlapping compositions.
Paediatric studies
Fluenz efficacy
Fluenz’s efficacy data in the paediatric population consist of 9 controlled studies comprising 
over 20,000 infants and toddlers, children and adolescents, conducted during 7 influenza seasons. Four 
placebo-controlled studies included second season revaccination. Fluenz has demonstrated superiority 
in 3 active-controlled studies with injectable influenza vaccine. See Table 1 and 2 for a summary of 
efficacy results in the paediatric population.

Fluenz safety
Chronic conditions
Although safety in children and adolescents with mild to moderate asthma has been established, 
data in children with other pulmonary diseases or with chronic cardiovascular, metabolic or renal 
diseases are limited.
In a study (D153-P515) of children 6 to 17 years of age with asthma (trivalent Fluenz: n=1,114, 
trivalent injectable influenza vaccine: n=1,115), there were no significant differences between 
treatment groups in the incidence of asthma exacerbations, mean peak expiratory flow rate, asthma
symptom scores, or night-time awakening scores. The incidence of wheezing within 15 days after 
vaccination was lower in Fluenz recipients relative to inactivated vaccine recipients 
(19.5% vs. 23.8%, P=0.02).
In a study of children and adolescents 9 to 17 years of age with moderate to severe asthma 
(trivalent Fluenz: n=24, placebo: n=24), the primary safety criterion, change in percent predicted 
forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) measured before and after vaccination, did not differ 
between treatment arms.
In studies of adults in which a high percentage of individuals had underlying chronic medical 
conditions, the safety profile of trivalent Fluenz was comparable to the safety profile observed 
in individuals without these conditions.
Immunocompromised
In 24 HIV-infected children and 25 HIV-negative children 1 through 7 years of age, and 
in 243 HIV-infected children and adolescents 5 through 17 years of age receiving stable anti-retroviral 
therapy, the frequency and duration of vaccine virus shedding were comparable to that seen in healthy 
individuals. No adverse effects on HIV viral load or CD4 counts were identified following trivalent 
Fluenz administration. Twenty mild to moderately immunocompromised children and 
adolescents 5 through 17 years of age (receiving chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy or who had 
recently received chemotherapy) were randomised 1:1 to trivalent Fluenz or placebo. Frequency and 
8
duration of vaccine virus shedding in these immunocompromised children and adolescents were 
comparable to that seen in healthy children and adolescents. The effectiveness of Fluenz and Fluenz 
Tetra in preventing influenza illness in immunocompromised individuals has not been evaluated.
Fluenz Tetra immunogenicity
A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, non-inferiority study was conducted to 
assess the immunogenicity of Fluenz Tetra compared to Fluenz (active control) in children and 
adolescents 2-17 years of age. A total of 2,312 children and adolescents were randomised by site at 
a 3:1:1 ratio to receive either Fluenz Tetra or one of two formulations of comparator vaccine Fluenz, 
each containing a B strain that corresponded to one of the two B strains in Fluenz Tetra (a B strain of 
the Yamagata lineage and a B strain of the Victoria lineage).
Immunogenicity was evaluated by comparing geometric mean titres (GMTs) of strain-specific serum 
haemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibodies post dosing. Fluenz Tetra demonstrated immunologic 
non-inferiority to the two formulations of Fluenz as the upper bound for each of the four 95% CIs for 
the post-dose strain-specific GMT HAI antibody ratios was ≤ 1.5.
Adult studies
Several studies against placebo have shown that Fluenz may have some efficacy in adults. However, 
a conclusion on clinical benefit of this vaccine in adults could not be made given that results observed 
in some studies versus injectable influenza vaccines were suggestive of a lower efficacy of Fluenz.

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What Fluenz Tetra is and what it is used for
Fluenz Tetra is a vaccine to prevent influenza (flu). It is used in children and adolescents 24 months to 
less than 18 years of age. Fluenz Tetra will help to protect against the four virus strains contained in 
the vaccine, and other strains closely related to them.
How Fluenz Tetra works
When a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body’s natural defence system) will 
produce its own protection against the influenza virus. None of the ingredients in the vaccine can 
cause the flu.
Fluenz Tetra vaccine viruses are grown in chicken eggs. Each year the vaccine targets four strains of 
influenza, following the annual recommendations by the World Health Organisation.
2. What you need to know before you are given Fluenz Tetra
You will not be given Fluenz Tetra:





if you are allergic to gentamicin, gelatin or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine (listed in 
section 6 “Contents of the pack and other information”). 
if you have ever had a severe allergic reaction to eggs or egg proteins. For signs of allergic 
reactions, see section 4 “Possible side effects”.
if you have a blood disorder or a cancer that affects the immune system.
if you have been told by your doctor that you have a weakened immune system as a result 
of a disease, medicine or other treatment.
if you are already taking acetylsalicylic acid (a substance present in many medicines used 
to relieve pain and lower fever). This is because of the risk of a very rare but serious disease
(Reye’s syndrome).
If any of these apply, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.
22
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before vaccination:

if the child is less than 24 months of age. Children less than 24 months of age should not 
receive this vaccine because of the risk of side effects.
if you have severe asthma or are currently wheezing.
if you are in close contact with someone with a severely weakened immune system
(for example, a bone marrow transplant patient needing isolation).


If any of these apply, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before vaccination. He or she will 
decide if Fluenz Tetra is suitable for you.
Other medicines, other vaccines and Fluenz Tetra
Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if the person being vaccinated is taking, has recently taken or 
might take any other medicines, including medicines that do not require a prescription.

Do not give acetylsalicylic acid (a substance present in many medicines used to relieve pain and 
lower fever) to children for 4 weeks after vaccination with Fluenz Tetra unless your doctor, 
nurse or pharmacist tells you otherwise. This is because of the risk of Reye’s syndrome, a very 
rare but serious disease that can affect the brain and liver.
It is recommended that Fluenz Tetra is not given at the same time as influenza-specific 
antiviral medicines, such as oseltamivir and zanamivir. This is because the vaccine may work 
less effectively.

Your doctor, nurse or pharmacist will decide if Fluenz Tetra can be given at the same time as other 
vaccines.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding

If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, plan to become pregnant soon or are 
breast-feeding, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before receiving this vaccine. Fluenz 
Tetra is not recommended for women who are pregnant or are breast-feeding.
Driving and using machines

Fluenz Tetra has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
3.
How Fluenz Tetra is given
Fluenz Tetra will be administered under the supervision of a doctor, nurse or pharmacist.
Fluenz Tetra must only be used as a nasal spray.
Fluenz Tetra must not be injected.
Fluenz Tetra will be given as a spray in each nostril. You can breathe normally while you are given 
Fluenz Tetra. You do not need to actively inhale or sniff.
Dosage
The recommended dose for children and adolescents is 0.2 ml Fluenz Tetra, administered as 0.1 ml 
in each nostril. Children who have not previously had an influenza vaccine will receive a second, 
follow-up dose after an interval of at least 4 weeks. Follow your doctor, nurse or pharmacist’s
instructions about if and when your child should return for the second dose.
If you have any further questions on this vaccine, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.

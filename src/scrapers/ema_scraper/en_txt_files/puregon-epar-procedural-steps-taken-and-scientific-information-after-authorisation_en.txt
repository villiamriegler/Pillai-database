treatment, multiple pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy, 
ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, ovarian torsion, 
ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, 
vascular complications, other medical conditions 
(SmPC section 4.4). The Package leaflet is updated 
accordingly. 
The MAH is taking the opportunity to update the PI in

by detecting multi-fetal gestations. The Company has 
introduced information to section 4.4 of the SmPC on 
management of the ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome. 
The revised wording is acceptable and is considered to 
enhance clinical safety of patients. 
Grammatical changes have been made to sections 4.4, 4.6, 
4.8 and 5 of the SmPC to improve clarity of meaning on 
use of the medicinal product and to comply with the QRD 
template; furthermore minor editorial corrections were 
made throughout the SmPC. These changes are also 
acceptable.  
The PL has been updated in order to reflect the SmPC 
changes described above. 
Overall, the changes to the product information texts are 
considered to improve clinical safety and so the benefit / 
risk balance of the current product in the stated indications 
remains as positive.

1. Type IB variation regarding a deletion of a 
complete pharmaceutical form; i.e. all strengths and 
presentations of the pharmaceutical form Powder 
and solvent for solution for injection 
[EU/1/96/008/001-016]. 
The deletion will require an update of Annex I, IIA, 
IIIA and IIIB of the Complete set of Annexes. 
2. Type IB variation regarding a deletion of one of 
the strengths of the pharmaceutical form Solution for 
injection; i.e. 250 IU/0.5 ml Solution for Injection, all 
presentations [EU/1/96/008/035-037]. 
The deletion will require an update of Annex I, IIA, 
IIIA and IIIB of the Complete set of Annexes. 
Background of the changes: 
[1] 
Type IB - C.I.7.a Deletion of a  pharmaceutical form; 
EU/1/96/008/001-016 - recFSH 
Page 18/30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Puregon Powder and solvent for solution for 
injection (Puregon Powder) pharmaceutical form was 
the first pharmaceutical form of Puregon as approved 
in the initial application in the EU in 1996. The 
Puregon Powder pharmaceutical form was approved 
in four strengths each with four presentations 
(including both ampoule-ampoule and ampoule-vial 
combinations). Since then, the pharmaceutical forms 
Solution for injection in vials and Solution for 
injection in cartridges (for use with Puregon Pen) 
have been approved and launched. The Puregon 
Powder presentations are the least user-friendly, and 
therefore the powder presentations have been taken 
off the market in the EU shortly after the launch of 
Puregon 
Solution for injection in vials. The last batch ever 
marketed in any country world-wide expired early 
2010. 
[2] 
Type IB - C.I.7.b Deletion of a strength; 
EU/1/96/008/035-036 - recFSH 
In this submission the MAH applies for the deletion of 
one of the strengths of Puregon Solution for injection 
in vials (250 IU/0.5 ml). This strength is the highest 
strenght of the approved Puregon Solution for 
injections in vials, next to the stenghts of 50, 75 
100, 150, 200 and 225 IU/0.5 ml. The strength 250 
IU/0.5 ml in vials has never been on the market in 
any EU

C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
Following a re-analysis of safety data a separate warning 
regarding ovarian torsion is included in the SPC Section 
4.4. OHSS, pregnancy, previous abdominal surgery, past 
history of ovarian torsion, previous or current ovarian cyst 
and polycystic ovaries have been identified as risk factors 
for ovarian torsion. Damage to the ovary due to reduced 
blood supply can be limited by early diagnosis and 
immediate detorsion. 
SPC Section 4.8 was amended by including the following 
adverse reactions in the table concerning treatment in 
females: abdominal discomfort, constipation, diarrhoea, 
metrorrhagia, ovarian cyst, ovarian torsion, uterine 
enlargement, vaginal haemorrhage (uncommon). 
Headache, rash and injection site pain (common) are 
included in the table concerning treatment in men.  
Minor changes in the labelling and other SPC sections (4.1; 
4.2; 4.3; 4.6) and corrections of linguistic differences 
between the Puregon and Fertavid texts were also agreed. 
The PL is updated accordingly.

The MAH submitted a type II variation to update the 
the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) and

implement the results of the recoding from WHO ART 
to MedDRA and to the addition of warning on 
hepatotoxicity in association with ovarian 
hyperstimulation syndrome in section 4.4 of the SPC. 
In addition to this, the Marketing Authorisation 
Holder (MAH) updated the heading of the section 6.6 
of the SPC according to the QRD template 7.1. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and

section 4.8 of the SPC and section 4 of the PL in order to 
implement the results of the recoding from WHO ART to 
MedDRA and to the addition of warning on hepatotoxicity in 
association with ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome in 
section 4.4 of the SPC. In addition to this, the MAH updated 
the heading of the section 6.6 of the SPC according to the 
QRD template 7.1. 
The MAH stated, that cases of liver function abnormalities 
associated with Ovarian Hyperstimulation syndrome 
(OHSS) have been reported in the literature and clinical 
guidelines on OHSS include that liver enzymes may be 
elevated in serious cases of OHSS and should be 
monitored. The MAH proposed to include a warning in 
section 4.4 of the SPC that liver function test abnormalities 
have been observed in cases of severe or moderate OHSS. 
The following wording has been added: 
Transient liver function test abnormalities suggestive of 
hepatic dysfunction, which may be accompanied by 
morphologic changes on liver biopsy, have been reported in 
association with ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. 
The MAH updated section 4.8 of SPC in order to reflect the 
change from WHO-ART to MedDRA terminology for

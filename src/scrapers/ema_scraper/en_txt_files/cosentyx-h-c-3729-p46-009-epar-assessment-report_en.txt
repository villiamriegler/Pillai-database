1.  Introduction 
On  10  January  2020,  the  MAH  submitted  a  clinical  study  report  for  a  completed  non-interventional 
clinical study (study number CAIN457AJP02) for Cosentyx. In principle, the completed study was not a 
paediatric study, but since a single adolescent (17-year-old) patient had been enrolled into the study, 
the clinical study report was submitted in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, 
as amended. 
A clinical expert overview has also been provided. It briefly summarises the study results in the overall 
population as well as results from the single adolescent patient. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
Secukinumab  (Cosentyx)  is  a  high-affinity  recombinant,  fully  human  monoclonal  anti-human 
Interleukin-17A  (IL-17A)  antibody  of  the  IgG1  (immunoglobulin  G1)/κ-class  that  binds  to  IL-17A  and 
neutralises  the  bioactivity  of  this  cytokine.  IL-17A  is  the  central  lymphokine  of  a  defined  subset  of 
inflammatory T cells (Th17). It is mainly produced by memory CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes and is 
recognized  as  an  important  pro-inflammatory  cytokine  in  immune-mediated  inflammatory  diseases. 
Cosentyx  is  approved  in  more  than  90  countries  worldwide  for  the  treatment  of  plaque  psoriasis, 
psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. 
Study  CAIN457AJP02  was  an  open-label,  multicentre,  uncontrolled,  single-arm,  prospective 
observational  study  to  collect  data  on  the  long-term  safety  and  efficacy  of  Cosentyx  in  clinical  use in 
Japanese patients with psoriasis vulgaris or psoriatic arthritis. This study recruited one single paediatric 
patient aged 17 years. A line listing of any other potentially concerned studies is not annexed. 
According  to  the  MAH,  the  results  of  this  trial  do  not  reveal  any  new  concern  about  the  safety  and 
efficacy  of  Cosentyx  in  Japanese  patients  with  psoriasis  vulgaris  and  psoriatic  arthritis  and 
demonstrates  its  safety  and  efficacy  in  clinical  use.  Furthermore,  the  MAH  stated  that  data  from  the 
single 17-year-old patient do not warrant an update of the currently approved product labelling. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
This non-interventional study was conducted after Cosentyx was released on the Japanese market. The 
following commercial presentations are listed in the study report as having been used: 
(1) Cosentyx 150 mg Syringe for Subcutaneous Injection 
(2) Cosentyx 150 mg for Subcutaneous Injection 
(3) Cosentyx 150 mg Pen for Subcutaneous Injection

2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
• 
Study CAIN457AJP02, titled “Specified use-results survey to evaluate the long-term safety and 
efficacy  of  Cosentyx  Subcutaneous  Injection  in  psoriasis  vulgaris  patients  and  psoriatic  arthritis 
patients, including retrospective observation.” 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Study  CAIN457AJP02  “Specified  use-results  survey  to  evaluate  the  long-term  safety  and  efficacy  of 
Cosentyx Subcutaneous Injection in psoriasis vulgaris patients and psoriatic arthritis patients, including 
retrospective observation.” 
Description 
This non-interventional survey was developed and carried out by the MAH to collect safety and efficacy 
data  for  Cosentyx,  including  retrospective  data,  from  the  patient  population  that  received  Cosentyx 
soon  after  its  market  release  in  Japan  and  before  a  similar,  authority-mandated  survey  was 
subsequently initiated. 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
The  stated  objective  of  the  survey  was  to  collect  long-term  safety  and  efficacy  data  of  Cosentyx 
Subcutaneous Injection in clinical use in psoriasis vulgaris or psoriatic arthritis patients. 
Study design 
The  study  was  an  open-label,  multicentre,  uncontrolled,  single-arm,  observational  study  involving 
psoriasis  vulgaris  or  psoriatic  arthritis  patients  who  received  Cosentyx  for  the  first  time  after  its 
approval in Japan and in accordance with the Japanese labelling. The duration of observation for each 
patient was 52 weeks from the start of treatment with Cosentyx. 
This  non-interventional  survey  had  no  binding  treatment  strategy,  diagnosis/treatment  steps  or  visit 
schedule. The patients were treated with Cosentyx in accordance with the approved labelling. Routine 
medical practice was followed for the visit frequency and the type of testing, and only such data were 
collected as part of this survey. 
Study population /Sample size 
Psoriasis  vulgaris  or  psoriatic  arthritis  patients  who  were  confirmed  to  meet  all  of  the  following 
inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria were registered in this survey: 
Inclusion criteria: 
• 
•

o  Patients with refractory eruption or joint symptoms 
Exclusion criteria: 
• 
• 
Patients  previously  treated  with  a  product  containing  the  same  active  substance  as  Cosentyx 
(as an investigational drug or in a post-marketing clinical study) 
Patients who will be treated with a product containing the same active substance as Cosentyx 
(in a post-marketing clinical study) 
A  total  of  300  patients  was  planned  to  be  included  in  the  safety  analysis  population.  The  planned 
maximum number of sites was 150. 
Treatments 
Cosentyx  was  to  be  used  in  accordance  with  its  authorised  posology  in  Japan.  There  were  no 
comparative treatments. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy and safety in clinical use were evaluated with conventionally used assessment tools. 
Efficacy  for  skin  symptoms:  Novartis  Investigator’s  Global  Assessment,  2011  modification  (IGA  mod 
2011);  Psoriasis  Area  and  Severity  Index  (PASI);  Eruption-covered  Body  Surface  Area  (BSA); 
Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI); Investigator’s global impression of change of skin symptoms. 
Efficacy  for  joint  symptoms:  Health  Assessment  Questionnaire  -  Disability  Index  [HAQ-DI;  Japanese 
version of HAQ (J-HAQ)]; 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28-CRP); Physician’s global assessment 
of  disease  activity;  Patient’s  global  assessment  of  psoriatic  arthritis  pain;  Assessment  of  dactylitis  in 
fingers and toes; Presence/absence of swollen/tender distal interphalangeal joints of fingers and toes; 
Presence/absence  of  tenderness  in  entheses  (Achilles  tendons,  humerus  lateral  epicondyles,  medial 
condyles  of  femur,  and  plantar  aponeuroses);  Bath  Ankylosing  Spondylitis  Disease  Activity  Index 
(BASDAI); Investigator’s global impression of change of joint symptoms. 
Safety: Adverse event queries; Laboratory assessments. A group of adverse events, comprising events 
that  are  of  special  interest  in  relation  to  the  use  of  secukinumab,  was  separately  pre-defined  as 
“priority  survey  items”.  This  group  of  events  comprised  serious  infections,  tuberculosis,  neutropenia, 
fungus  infections,  hypersensitivity  reactions,  malignant  tumours,  inflammatory  bowel  disease,  and 
cardiovascular/cerebrovascular events. 
Statistical Methods 
The data has been summarised with descriptive statistics on safety and efficacy. 
CHMP comment 
The  study  reported  within  the  current  submission  was  a  non-interventional  survey  developed  and 
carried  out  by  the  MAH  to  collect  safety  and  efficacy  data  for  Cosentyx,  including  retrospective  data, 
from the patient population that received Cosentyx soon after its market release in Japan. The study 
design  and  execution  in  themselves  seem  typical  for  a  non-interventional  survey,  with  no  unusual 
features. 
For  purposes  of  assessment  from  the  perspective  of  Article  46,  the  overall  relevance  of  the  study  is 
very limited, as it primarily enrolled an adult population in accordance with the authorised use.

Results 
Recruitment/ Numbers analysed 
The  survey  period  for  this  study  started  on  4  November  2015.  The  registration  period  ended  on 
30 September 2016, and the data collection period ended upon database lock on 19 July 2019. 
In total, 312 patients were registered for this survey at 100 sites in Japan. Six patients were excluded 
from the safety analysis population due to administrative reasons, and 306 patients were thus included 
in  the  safety  analysis  population.  Patients  with  no  assessment of  global  impression  of  change of  skin 
symptoms  or  who  were  not  evaluable  at  all  time  points  were  excluded  from  the  efficacy  analysis 
population. Consequently, out of the 306 patients included in the safety analysis population, a total of 
250 patients were included in the efficacy analysis population. 
No  patients  under  the  age  of  15  years  (Japanese  definition  of  paediatric  patients)  were  enrolled,  but 
one  17-year-old  patient  was  enrolled  and  was  thus  considered  as  a  paediatric  patient  as  per  the  EU 
definition. 
In  terms  of  patient  disposition,  242/306  (79%)  patients  in  the  safety  analysis  population  completed 
the 52-week observation period. In total, 57 patients did not formally discontinue but were recorded as 
not completing the 52-week observation period, as either a second survey form was not collected, their 
duration of observation was less than 52 weeks, or their second survey form data was excluded from 
analysis.  Seven  patients  discontinued  the  study,  with  6  patients  failing  to  return  mid-course  and 
1 patient withdrawing consent. 
Baseline data 
In the overall population, 27% of patients were female, and mean (SD) age at the start of treatment 
with  Cosentyx  was  55.9  (13.9)  years.  Overall,  68%  of  patients  used  Cosentyx  for  psoriasis  vulgaris 
and 32% for psoriatic arthritis; in both groups, over 80% of patients had a disease duration exceeding 
5 years. Previous use of biological products for psoriasis was reported for 174 (57%) patients overall; 
the  most  frequently  used  prior  biological  products  included  adalimumab  (101  patients),  infliximab 
(92 patients),  and  ustekinumab  (87  patients)  (patients  who  had  received  more  than  one  biological 
product  are  counted  separately  for  each  product).  Most  of  these  patients  had  discontinued  prior 
biologics due to lack of efficacy. 
The distribution of IGA scores and PASI scores at baseline is shown in Table 1. 
Table 1  
Distribution of IGA and PASI scores at baseline (safety analysis population) 
The single paediatric patient was a 17-year-old patient with psoriatic arthritis who had a total disease 
duration  of  ≥  1  year  -  <  5  years,  no  other  medical  history,  a  BMI  of  19.9,  and  a  history  of  a  prior 
biological treatment.

Efficacy results 
Skin symptoms 
In the overall population, the PASI 75 response rate was 55% at Week 4. After 12 weeks of treatment 
with Cosentyx, PASI 75, PASI 90 and PASI 100 response rates were 79%, 62% and 42%, respectively. 
At Week 24, the corresponding response rates were 79%, 60% and 41%. 
Among patients with a baseline IGA score of 2 or higher, an IGA score of 0 or 1 was reported for 54% 
of patients at Week 4, for 78% of patients at Week 12, and for 81% of patients at Week 24. 
In the Investigator’s global impression of change of skin symptoms, a complete or partial response was 
reported for 90% of patients at Week 4, and for 95% of patients at Week 12 and Week 24. 
PASI  response  rates  over  time  were  also  separately  analysed  according  to  the  patients’  prior  use  of 
biological products. The results of this analysis are displayed in Table 2. 
Table 2  
PASI response rates by use/non-use of prior biological products 
A  factorial  analysis  of  response  rates  based  on  various  baseline  characteristics  (such  as  age,  sex, 
weight, disease duration, medical history) identified no particular trends. 
Joint symptoms 
This analysis was performed for patients with joint symptom evaluation results among the 80 patients 
(32.00%) in the efficacy analysis population (250 patients) who were diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis 
at the start of Cosentyx. For many endpoints, data was only available or a small proportion of patients, 
e.g. 12 patients for HAQ-DI, 19 patients for DAS28-CRP, and 21 patients for physician assessment of 
disease  activity.  Overall,  decreasing  trends  were  observed  across  the endpoints  assessed.  At  the  last 
available  assessment,  a  complete  response  was  reported  in  27/61  (44%)  patients,  and  a  partial 
response in 24/61 (39%) patients in the Investigator’s global impression of change of joint symptoms.

Paediatric patient 
For  the  single  paediatric  patient,  no  data  was  available  on  the  global  impression  of  change  for  either 
skin or joint symptoms. It can be noted however that “decreased therapeutic response” was reported 
as a non-serious adverse reaction for this patient. 
Safety results 
Overall population 
In  the  overall  study  population,  mean  (SD)  duration  of  observation  was  355  (38)  days,  and  mean 
duration  of  treatment  with  Cosentyx  was  316  (81)  days.  Over  90%  of  patients  were  treated  for 
≥ 24 weeks  and  over  70%  for  ≥  48  weeks.  The  starting  dose  of  Cosentyx  was  150  mg  in  2.6%  and 
300 mg  in  97.4%  of  patients,  and  the  most  frequent  dose  of  Cosentyx  was  150  mg  in  3.3%  and 
300 mg in 96.7% of patients. 
Adverse  events  were  observed  in  41.2%  (126  patients)  of  the  306  patients  in  the  safety  analysis 
population.  MedDRA  System  Organ  Classes  with  most  reports  included  Infections  and  infestations 
(18.3%, 56 patients), Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (13.1%, 40 patients), General disorders 
and  administration  site  conditions  (6.9%,  21  patients),  Investigations  (6.9%,  21  patients), 
Gastrointestinal disorders (4.6%, 14 patients), Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (4.3%, 
13  patients),  and  Respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders  (3.6%,  11  patients).  The  most 
common  individual  adverse  events,  reported  by  over  3%  of  patients,  were  nasopharyngitis  (4.9%; 
15 patients) and psoriasis (4.6%; 14 patients). 
Adverse  reactions  were  noted  in  24.2%  (74  patients)  of  the  306  patients  in  the  safety  analysis 
population.  The  most  common  adverse  reactions,  reported  by  1%  of  patients  or  more,  were  oral 
candidiasis  (2.9%,  9  patients),  psoriasis  (2.3%,  7  patients),  nasopharyngitis  (1.6%,  5  patients)  and 
generalised pruritus (1.31%, 4 patients). 
Adverse  reactions  were  reported  in  49  of  the  174  patients  (28.2%)  who  had  received  biological 
products  prior  to  the  start  of  Cosentyx,  compared  to  25  of  the  131  patients  (19.1%)  who  had  not 
received prior biological products. 
No  deaths  were  reported  in  the  study.  Non-fatal  serious  adverse  events  were  observed  in  7.19% 
(22 patients)  of  the  306  patients  in  the  safety  analysis  population.  Herpes  zoster  and  a  decreased 
therapeutic  response  were  each  reported  in  two  patients,  with  the  other  SAEs  occurring  in  single 
patients.  Of  these  SAEs,  the  ones  suspected  to  be  drug  related  were  asthma,  influenza  like  illness, 
Crohn’s  disease,  pulmonary  tuberculosis,  latent  tuberculosis,  anaphylactic  reaction,  supraventricular 
tachycardia,  diarrhoea,  facial  paralysis,  malaise,  cell  marker  increased,  therapeutic  response 
decreased,  concomitant  disease  progression,  nasopharyngitis,  myocardial  infarction  and  psoriasis  in 
1 patient each. The outcomes of these events were “recovered” or “recovering”, except for limb injury, 
which did not recover. 
In  the  safety  analysis  population  (306  patients),  adverse  events  led  to  treatment  discontinuation  in 
6.54%  (20  patients).  The  adverse  event  that  led  to  treatment  discontinuation  most  frequently  was 
psoriasis  (4  patients),  and  all  the  cases  were  non-serious  and  not  causally  related  to  Cosentyx.  The 
adverse  events  that  led  to  treatment  discontinuation  in  2  or  more  patients  were  drug  ineffective 
(3 patients),  interstitial  lung  disease,  psoriatic  arthropathy  and  therapeutic  product  effect  incomplete 
(2  patients),  of  which  drug  ineffective  and  interstitial  lung  disease  in  2  patients  and  therapeutic 
product effect incomplete in 1 patient were assessed to be related to Cosentyx. Adverse events leading 
to  treatment  discontinuation  were  more  commonly  reported  among  patients  with  previous  use  of 
biological products (15/174 (8.6%) patients vs. 5/131 (3.8%) patients); most common events among

this  subgroup  of  patients  were  psoriasis  (4  patients),  drug  ineffective  (3  patients),  and  therapeutic 
product effect incomplete (2 patients). 
Adverse  events  belonging  to  priority  survey  items  were  reported  in  48  patients  (15.7%)  overall.  The 
most  common  events  were  oral  candidiasis  (9  patients),  rash  (5  patients),  eczema  (4  patients),  and 
tinea pedis (3 patients). Temporal characteristics of these events are depicted in Table 3. 
Table 3 
Temporal characteristics of adverse reactions related to priority survey items (time to 
initial occurrence, time to resolution) (safety analysis population) 
A factorial analysis of adverse event data based on various baseline characteristics (such as age, sex, 
weight, disease duration, medical history) identified no particular trends. 
Paediatric patient 
For  the  paediatric  patient,  non-serious  adverse  reactions  of  a  staphylococcal  ear  infection,  decreased 
therapeutic  response  and  arthralgia  were  reported.  The  corresponding  outcomes  were  “recovered”, 
“not recovered” and “recovering”. 
CHMP comment 
The  efficacy  and  safety  data  reported  in  the  survey  are  in  line  with  previous  results  from  controlled 
clinical studies with secukinumab, and there are no new findings or observations of concern. The safety 
findings are appropriately addressed in existing Product Information for secukinumab. 
In terms of paediatric use, the reported survey assessed adult patients, and no conclusions relevant to 
Article 46 can be made based on a single treated adolescent patient. 
Overall, the results of the study do not change the benefit-risk profile of secukinumab. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects

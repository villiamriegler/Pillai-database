2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Cytotoxic chemotherapy suppresses the hematopoietic system causing profound and sometimes 
prolonged neutropenia. Chemotherapy-induced neutropenia is the major dose-limiting toxicity of 
systemic cancer chemotherapy. It may result in hospitalisation for treatment of fever or cause 
potentially fatal infection.  Such complications of chemotherapy treatment often result in dose 
reduction or treatment delay which may compromise clinical outcome. Risk factors for cytotoxic 
chemotherapy-induced neutropenia are: advanced age, poor performance status, poor nutritional 
status and low baseline and first cycle nadir blood cell count along with high chemotherapy dose 
intensity.  Some chemotherapy regimens are more myelosuppressive than others. High 
cyclophosphamide dose, etoposide and high anthracycline doses have been identified as significant 
predictors for severe neutropenia. 
Prophylactic antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral agents have been administered to prevent the 
development of infection as a complication of neutropenia. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-
CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) are used to reduce the duration 
and degree of neutropenia. G-CSF increases the proliferation and differentiation of neutrophils from 
progenitor cells, induces maturation and enhances the survival and function of mature neutrophils.  
According to the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) guideline, 
primary prophylactic G-CSF treatment is recommended in case the overall risk of febrile neutropenia 
(FN) for a patient is ≥20%. When using chemotherapy regimens associated with a FN risk of 10-20%, 
particular attention should be given to the assessment of patient characteristics that may increase the 
overall risk of FN (Aapro et al., EJC, 2006; 42: 2433-53).  Evidence from multiple randomised trials 
supports the benefit of primary prophylaxis in reducing the frequency of hospitalisation for antibiotic 
therapy, documented infection, and rates of neutropenic fever in adults. The impact on survival is less 
clear (Kuderer et al., J. Clin Oncol 2007; 25:3158).  
Recombinant hG-CSF (filgrastim) has been introduced in clinical use since 1991 under the trade name 
Neupogen. Recombinant hG-CSF is produced in E. coli. Its amino acid sequence is identical to that of 
natural human G-CSF, except for the addition of an N-terminal methionine necessary for the 
expression in E. coli and it is not glycosylated.  
About the product 
The natural human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is a glycoprotein composed of a 
single polypeptide chain of 174 amino acids and is glycosylated at a threonine residue. It: 
• 
• 
• 
regulates the proliferation and differentiation of progenitor cells within the bone marrow and the 
release of mature neutrophils into the peripheral blood 
is a positive regulator of granulopoiesis, acting at different stages of myeloid cell development  
enhances the effector functions of normal mature neutrophils, including chemotaxis, phagocytosis 
and oxidative metabolism  
exerting its effects via a high-affinity G-CSF-specific receptor mechanism, which accounts for its 
selective action compared to many other cytokines.

Grastofil, is a formulation of non-glycosylated recombinant granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-
CSF or filgrastim) developed as a biosimilar medicinal product to the reference product Neupogen. 
Filgrastim in Grastofil is also referred to as “Apo-filgrastim”, which was the company development code 
for the product. 
Grastofil is presented in single use prefilled syringes in two strengths, 300μg/0.5ml and 480μg/0.5ml. 
It is administered via the intravenous (i.v. infusion) or subcutaneous (s.c. injection) route of 
administration. 
Grastofil is indicated for the reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile 
neutropenia in adult patients treated with established cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the 
exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes) and for the reduction in the 
duration of neutropenia in adult patients undergoing myeloablative therapy followed by bone marrow 
transplantation considered to be at increased risk of prolonged severe neutropenia.  
Grastofil is indicated for the mobilisation of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) in adults. 
In adult patients with severe congenital, cyclic, or idiopathic neutropenia with an absolute neutrophil 
count (ANC) of ≤ 0.5 x 109/L, and a history of severe or recurrent infections, long term administration 
of Grastofil is indicated to increase neutrophil counts and to reduce the incidence and duration of 
infection-related events. 
Grastofil is indicated for the treatment of persistent neutropenia (ANC less than or equal to 1.0 x 
109/L) in adults with advanced HIV infection, in order to reduce the risk of bacterial infections when 
other options to manage neutropenia are inappropriate. 
Grastofil therapy should only be given in collaboration with an oncology centre which has experience in 
granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) treatment and haematology and has the necessary 
diagnostic facilities. The mobilisation and apheresis procedures should be performed in collaboration 
with an oncology-haematology centre with acceptable experience in this field and where the monitoring 
of haematopoietic progenitor cells can be correctly performed. 
The recommended dose of filgrastim is 0.5 MU/kg/day (5 μg/kg/day). The first dose of Grastofil should 
not be administered less than 24 hours following cytotoxic chemotherapy. In patients with 
myeloablative therapy, the recommended starting dose of filgrastim is 1.0 MU/kg/day (10 μg/kg/day). 
In patients undergoing myelosuppressive or myeloablative therapy followed by autologous PBPC 
transplantation the recommended dose of filgrastim for PBPC mobilisation when used alone is 1.0 
MU/kg/day (10 μg/kg/day) for 5 - 7 consecutive days, whereas in normal donors, the recommended 
dosage is 1.0 MU/kg/day (10 μg/kg/day) for 4 - 5 consecutive days. In congenital neutropenia, the 
recommended starting dose is 1.2 MU/kg/day (12 μg/kg/day) as a single dose or in divided doses. The 
recommended starting dose for idiopathic or cyclic neutropenia is 0.5 MU/kg/day (5 μg/kg/day) as a 
single dose or in divided doses. The recommended starting dose of filgrastim is 0.1 MU/kg/day (1 
μg/kg/day) given daily with titration up to a maximum of 0.4 MU/kg/day (4 μg/kg/day) until a normal 
neutrophil count is reached and can be maintained (ANC > 2.0 x 109/L).  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Grastofil has been developed as a “similar biological medicinal product” according to Article 10 (4) and 
Annex 1, Part II, Chapter 4 of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended. The chosen reference medicinal 
product is Neupogen, which is manufactured and marketed by Amgen Ltd.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/303037/2013 
Page 7/89 
 
 
 
Grastofil is presented as a solution for injection or infusion in prefilled glass syringes containing 30MU / 
0.5ml or 48MU / 0.5ml filgrastim.  
The reference comparator products are Neupogen 30 MU (300 mcg/0.5 ml) solution for injection in 
pre-filled syringe and Neupogen 48 MU (480 mcg/0.5 ml) solution for injection in pre-filled syringe, 
Amgen Europe B.V. sourced from the EU market. The same reference product, Neupogen, was used for 
the entire comparability exercise to demonstrate comparable quality, safety and efficacy of the test 
product.  
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Filgrastim is a recombinant Human Methionyl Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor (rHu-met-GCSF), 
produced at Intas Biopharmaceuticals Ltd. (IBPL) from E. coli host cells transformed with the codon-
optimized GCSF DNA.  
The protein obtained by this technology is non-glycosylated and consists of 175 amino acids of 
molecular weight 18800.8 Da.  
Filgrastim contains 5 cysteine residues; these 5 cysteine residues form 2 disulfide bridges, leaving 1 
free cysteine residue. 
The mature and unmodified form of G-CSF has a predominant alpha helical secondary structure. 
Manufacture 
The Cell Substrate was generated by transfer of codon-optimized GCSF DNA to E. coli BL21 DE3 host 
cells using an expression vector. The vector development involved multiple steps of genetic 
engineering and manipulation. 
A two tier cell bank system is followed at Intas Biopharmaceuticals Limited (IBPL), which consists of 
the Master Cell Bank (MCB) and a Working Cell Bank (WCB).  
The MCBs and WCBs are characterized to ensure identity, purity, viability and stability of the cell bank 
for its intended use.  
Appropriate data have been provided to demonstrate genetic stability of the host cell construct. 
E.coli are expanded in fermentors using human and animal-free growth media. Filgrastim is 
concentrated in E.coli inclusion bodies (IB) which are isolated by cell disruption and centrifugation and 
then solubilised to allow protein re-folding.  
Down-stream processing involves several filtration and chromatographic purification steps to separate 
filgrastim from other contaminating proteins and impurities. This is followed by further 
chromatography steps to yield the active substance solution. 
In-Process Manufacturing Controls 
The manufacturing process and control strategy has been adequately described. Classification and 
definitions of the Operating Parameters and Performance Parameters into critical (CPP) and key 
process parameters (KPP) were provided. In-process manufacturing controls (CPP or KPP) for each 
step of the manufacture process, together with acceptance criteria or expected ranges, were 
established on the basis of a risk assessment.  
Process validation 
CPPs or KPPs for each step of the commercial manufacturing process and Drug Substance release 
specifications were studied to qualify the manufacturing process performance during three consecutive 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/303037/2013 
Page 8/89 
 
 
 
Drug Substance production batches. The results showed good reproducibility, often within narrower 
limits than the predefined ranges. The proven acceptable ranges for operating and performance 
parameters have been adequately supported with qualifying data and proposed process monitoring. 
Relevant information has been provided with respect process performance and consistency. 
Manufacturing process development 
The manufacturing process development has been an iterative process through nine sequential 
processes (Processes I to IX), not all of which have a direct relevance to Grastofil.  
Non clinical studies were conducted with material from Process V, clinical trials used product from 
Process VII and the proposed commercial medicinal product will be obtained with Process IX.  
Comparability data were provided for material derived from process VII and process IX vs the 
reference medicinal product Neupogen, see discussion on comparability. Additionally, Process IX 
derived drug product has been used in the Phase I 3-arm bridging study (GCSF-SUIN-05Sb01-3FA) to 
support the claims of in vivo biosimilarity of Grastofil and Neupogen (see discussion on clinical 
pharmacology). 
Specification 
Characterisation 
The structural and functional characteristics of the drug substance have been investigated using a 
variety of analytical tools, including N-terminal sequencing, SDS-PAGE, Isoelectric Focusing (IEF), 
peptide mapping, mass spectrometry, and determination of biological activity.  
The biological activity was assessed using two orthogonal procedures: an in vitro cell proliferation 
assay and a receptor binding assay. A number of additional techniques have been used to assess 
higher-order structure, including Circular Dichroism (CD), FTIR (Fourier Transformed Infrared 
Spectroscopy), Analytical Ultracentrifugation and thermal stability by Differential Scanning Calorimetry 
(DSC). The data presented confirmed the expected primary, secondary and tertiary structure, with no 
major clipped species, and that the molecule is functional.  
Impurities 
The Filgrastim Concentrated Solution (2206) monograph in the current edition of the European 
Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) contains specified impurities for the Reversed Phase (RP-) and Size Exclusion 
(SE-) chromatography procedures (oxidised forms, dimer and aggregates). No additional product-
related new impurities have been identified in the Grastofil Drug Substance. 
Process-related impurities include host cell contaminants (host cell protein and residual DNA) which 
have been shown to be consistently cleared by the manufacturing process. Additives used during 
manufacture were shown to be adequately removed.  
Control of Drug Substance 
The proposed specification for the Drug Substance reflects the requirements of the Ph.Eur. monograph 
for filgrastim concentrated solution, as well as currently available batch release and stability data, and 
is accepted.  
Routine testing is performed at release for Host Cell Protein (HCP) and residual DNA, bioburden, 
endotoxins. Identity is confirmed by peptide mapping and Isoelectric Focusing (IEF) against a 
reference solution, while the purity is tested by SDS-PAGE, RP-HPLC, SE-HPLC and IEF.  
The in-vitro bioassay is based on the on the Ph.Eur monograph for filgrastim concentrated solution. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/303037/2013 
Page 9/89 
 
 
 
The Ph. Eur. filgrastim monograph methods have been modified by the manufacturer, in part, to match 
the materials and commercial kits available to the manufacturer in their own territory or to improve 
the sensitivity of the monograph methods. The rationale for the changes introduced has been provided 
and the analytical methods have been appropriately validated.  
The applicant will review the drug substance specifications once data on a pre-determined number of 
batches is available. 
Container closure system 
The Drug Substance is filled into sterile glass bottles. 
Stability 
Stability studies of the Drug Substance were performed at long term (5 ± 3°C), and at short term with 
accelerated (25 ± 2°C), and stressed (40 ± 2°C) conditions according to ICH Q5C. Photostability 
studies indicate the drug substance is photolabile and should be protected from light.  
The proposed shelf life of 24 months for the Drug Substance when stored at 5°C ± 3 °C in the 
proposed container is accepted.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
The Drug Product is a sterile, clear, and colourless liquid formulation (acetate buffered, pH 4.0, isotonic 
solution for injection) in a 1 mL glass (Type I), single-use, prefilled syringe for parenteral 
administration in two strengths: 
•  30 MU (300 mcg/0.5 mL) dosage strength containing 300 mcg of Drug Substance 
•  48 MU (480 mcg/0.5 mL) dosage strength containing 480 mcg of Drug Substance 
Both strengths will be supplied in packs of one (1 x 1) or five (1 x 5) pre-filled syringes in a carton 
along with the prescribing information.  
Subcutaneous (s.c.) injection is the primary route of administration, although the product may also be 
diluted for infusion administration (administered by short intravenous (i.v.) infusion or continuous i.v. 
infusion).  
There are no validated markings on the syringe barrel that are compatible with paediatric posology. 
The Drug Product contains Filgrastim as the active pharmaceutical ingredient and excipients, similar to 
those of the reference medicinal product Neupogen. The quantitative composition of the Drug Product 
is given in the Table below.

The Drug Product is a liquid formulation (ready to use parenteral administration), and thus requires no 
reconstitution with any diluent. However, if required, it can be diluted with 5% dextrose (intravenous 
infusion fluid) either glass bottles or Polyolefin bags / PVC bags. Should the Drug Product be diluted to 
concentrations below 15mcg / ml, human serum albumin should be added to a final concentration of 2 
mg/mL.  
No diluent is supplied with the Drug Product. It is intended that standard 5% dextrose and human 
serum albumin solutions from hospital pharmacy stocks will be used to prepare the Drug Product for 
infusion. 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The Drug Product formulation was established based on knowledge of the formulation excipients and 
concentrations of the reference medicinal product.  
Pre-formulation and characterization studies confirmed that the excipients and concentrations in the 
formulation of the reference medicinal product are acceptable for the stability and maintenance of the 
Drug Substance at both 300 mcg/0.5 mL and 480 mcg/0.5 mL in the prefilled syringe presentation. 
Neither of the two Drug Product strengths employs an overage. Both strengths contain a 0.06 mL 
overfill (0.56 mL target fill volume) to ensure an extractable volume of 0.5 mL at the time of 
administration. 
Adventitious agents 
The manufacture of the Drug Product utilises one excipient of biological origin, Polysorbate 80, which is 
not animal-derived.  
Polysorbate 80 consists of a mixture of fatty acids. The materials used for the manufacturing of 
Polysorbate 80 are of vegetable and petrochemical origin and do not contain material of bovine, ovine 
or caprine origin.

Bovine milk sourced from New Zealand is in the composition of the Terrific Broth culture media, used 
in the production of the MCB or WCB. It is subject to a strong heat treatment, therefore, its viral safety 
is considered adequate.  
Other reagents from biological origin such as L-Cysteine are derived from feathers or human hair but 
are also processed under very harsh conditions.  
Manufacture of the product 
The Drug Product manufacturing process consists of mixing the active substance with the excipients 
(formulation buffer and polysorbate 80) and adjustment of pH followed by sterile filtration and filling 
into pre-sterilised syringes. The syringes are stoppered, transferred for visual inspection, and are 
subsequently labelled, packaged and dispatched. 
All excipients conform to the requirements of the European Pharmacopoeia. 
In-Process Manufacturing Controls 
The manufacturing process is controlled by a series of in-process controls. The process control strategy 
and critical steps were identified and evaluated during manufacturing process development. Critical 
Process Parameters (CPPs), Key Process Parameters (KPPs) and Non-Critical Process Parameters 
(NCPPs) were established.  
Manufacturing process development 
During development, the Drug Product manufacturing process underwent three process changes 
(Process I, II and III). The different processes resulted from changes that occurred in the 
manufacturing process, including changes related to scale up, changes to processing aids, addition and 
deletion of process steps and other changes. 
Each Drug Product process used Drug Substance from a different manufacturing process. Process I 
material was used in the non-clinical studies, process II in the clinical trials and process III is the 
proposed commercial process.  
An extensive comparability study has been performed between process II and III materials. 
Process validation 
The manufacturing processes for both Drug Product concentrations were qualified during three 
consecutive Drug Product production batches (for each concentration). All steps have been validated, 
including the shipping, for which the suitability of the containers and the stability of the product in case 
of temperature excursions have been demonstrated.  
Product specification 
Vela pharmazeutische Entwicklung will act as the release testing site of the commercial batches for the 
EU market. Adequate data has been provided for Vela pharmazeutische Entwicklung to act in that 
capacity. 
Control of Drug Product 
There is currently a Ph. Eur. monograph for Filgrastim Concentrated Solution (2206), which served as 
a basis for the establishment of the Drug Product specification. 
Routine testing is performed at release for sterility, bioburden, polysorbate 80. Identity is confirmed by 
IEF against a reference solution. Purity is tested by SDS-PAGE, RP-HPLC, SE-HPLC and IEF and the 
biological activity is measured by the same in-vitro bioassay as employed for the control of the Drug 
Substance. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/303037/2013 
Page 12/89 
 
 
 
The same methods as those used in the control of the Drug Substance are employed, except for the 
determination of polysorbate 80 concentration, which is specifically conducted on the Drug Product. 
The applicant will review the DP specifications once data on a pre-determined number of batches is 
available. 
Container closure system 
The Drug Product is presented as a solution for injection/infusion in a 1 mL glass, single-use, pre-filled 
syringe. 
The container closure system is a syringe system comprised of a syringe with a glass barrel assembled 
with a steel needle, an elastomeric needle shield and a polypropylene rigid needle shield; and an 
elastomeric plunger stopper 
The syringe is also assembled with a polypropylene plunger rod. The syringe barrel and stopper are 
lubricated with silicone oil. 
The glass syringe barrel, elastomeric needle shield, plunger stopper and the silicone oil comply with the 
the Ph.Eur. The needle adhesive is appropriately qualified for use. 
Stability of the product 
The Drug Product is to be stored at 2°C to 8°C.  
Stability data for six batches derived from process II Drug Product have been presented, including 36 
months at real time/real temperature conditions 6 months at accelerated and 7 days at stress 
conditions. Stability data is provided for three Process III drug product batches include up to 24 
months at real time/real temperature conditions, 6 months at accelerated and 28 days at stress 
conditions.  Stability data has also been presented for a further six more recently manufactured 
batches of Process III product stored for 6 months at long terms and accelerated conditions.   
In general, the results support the shelf-life of 30 months and the storage conditions (storage under 
refrigerated conditions at 2-8°C) as defined in the SmPC.  
Comparability to the reference medicinal product 
The chosen reference medicinal product, authorised in the EU and used for the entire comparability 
exercise, is Neupogen (Amgen Ltd.).  
The comparability exercise was based on 3 biosimilarity studies and included the comparison of a 
variety of attributes of both the reference medicinal product and Grastofil, such as physicochemical 
properties, biological activity, purity and impurity profiles, and stability profiles. The physicochemical 
attributes, including physical properties and primary and higher order structures of the Drug 
Substance, were evaluated using a combination of analytical procedures. The biological properties were 
assessed using both in vitro and in vivo assays. The purity and impurity profiles were evaluated both 
qualitatively and quantitatively using orthogonal analytical procedures. Finally, the stability profiles 
were evaluated under accelerated (25°C ± 2°C) and stressed (40°C ± 2°C) conditions. A forced 
degradation study was also employed to compare the degradation profiles of Grastofil and the 
reference medicinal product. 
The data presented sufficiently demonstrate that the Drug Substance and Drug Product from the 
clinical stages of process development (process VII Drug Substance / process II Drug Product) and 
from the commercial process (process IX Drug Substance / process II Drug Product) are comparable 
with one another and to the reference medicinal product Neupogen.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The upstream Drug Substance manufacturing process and process control strategy has been 
adequately described and appropriate assurances have been provided with respect to process control 
and consistency.  
Filgrastim Drug Substances destined for use in both EU and non-EU countries will be produced in the 
same manufacturing facility, using distinct manufacturing processes.  Assurance of adequate 
product/process segregation has been provided. Process-specific consumables including dedicated 
chromatography resins and ultrafiltration cartridges will be used. 
The product-specific GMP inspection of the Drug Substance manufacturing site, requested with this 
procedure, has confirmed that appropriate GMP measures are in place in order to control segregation 
and cross contamination of the proposed EU product from the non-EU regulated product. 
The drug product is manufactured in 300 mcg/0.5 mL and 480 mcg/0.5 mL pre-filled syringe 
presentations. No presentation compatible with the safe dosing of Grastofil in the paediatric population 
has been proposed. The proposed pre-filled syringes are considered to pose a risk of dosing errors in 
children, and additional presentation(s) such as a vial or a graduated syringe allowing accurate dosing 
in the paediatric population should be proposed. Paediatric indications may only be accepted following 
the submission of a post marketing variation at such time when an appropriate presentation is 
available. 
The comparability exercises conducted to support biosimilarity of Grastofil with the reference medicinal 
product Neupogen are adequate and their conclusions supported. The comparability studies are 
additionally supported by a phase I study in man comparing the Process IX / III commercial Grastofil 
with Neupogen. 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the Drug Substance and Drug Product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate satisfactory 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the 
conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
Based on the review of the data on quality, the manufacture and control of the Grastofil Drug 
Substance and the Drug Product are considered acceptable.  
The Quality of the product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in satisfactory way.  
Safety concerning adventitious agents including TSE has been sufficiently assured. 
Biosimilarity with the reference medicinal product Neupogen has been sufficiently demonstrated. 
From a quality point of view, the observed differences and levels of these differences have been well 
documented and are acceptable. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the review of drug substance specifications once data on a pre-determined 
number of batches is available.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The non-clinical development program for Grastofil was performed using Neukine (a non-EU product 
which, however, contains Process V drug substance). None of the non-clinical studies have been 
conducted using Apo-Filgrastim (Process IX drug substance, see discussion on non-clinical aspects).  
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro, a potency assay was conducted in a murine myeloblastic cell line. In vivo 1) a bioassay for G 
CSF in mice, 2) restoration of neutrophil blood cell counts by or Neukine vs. Neupogen (Filgrastim) in 
neutropenic female BALB/c mice and 3) a comparative effect study of Neukine with Neupogen when 
administered subcutaneously to mice with induced neutropenia, were conducted. Data from a general 
28 Day rat study was also used to demonstrate pharmacological changes.  
In the in vitro potency assay, the results of these studies indicated that both Neukine and the 
reference product bind to the murine cellular G-CSF receptors with the same affinity and that both 
preparations are equally effective at inducing cellular proliferation. 
In Swiss albino mice given subcutaneous doses of 0.1, 1, 5 and 10 μg of Neukine or a reference 
standard, relative potency of Neukine was found to be 1.0977 for total leukocyte count and 0.9162 for 
neutrophil count. The product used in this study was derived from the Drug Substance Process V of the 
Apo-Filgrastim and the reference product used in this study was Neupogen (Manufactured by Amgen, 
Marketed by Roche in India). 
In neutropenic female BALB/c mice, the restoration of neutrophil blood cell counts by Neukine vs. the 
reference product, Neupogen” was investigated. The data showed comparability between Neukine and 
the reference product in terms of increased neutrophil and leukocyte counts. 
A comparative study was carried out, in which Wistar rats were given subcutaneous doses of 50, 150 
and 500 μg/kg/day Neukine or the comparator Neupogen (150 μg/kg/day) for 28 days. The data 
showed that Neukine) and Neupogen at 150 μg/kg/day were comparable in terms of the increase in 
neutrophil counts.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamic studies were submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
Safety pharmacology programme 
No safety pharmacology studies were submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Reference was made to the toxicokinetic data from the 28 day GLP compliant study conducted in 
Wistar rats.  No studies have been performed to investigate distribution, metabolism, excretion and 
pharmacokinetic drug interactions (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/303037/2013 
Page 15/89 
 
 
 
2.3.3.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Four non-comparative single dose studies were conducted with Neukine. These studies were conducted 
in India and were not GLP compliant. Rats and mice were given i.v or s.c doses of 250, 2500 or 5000 
μg/kg. In mice and rats both the i.v. and s.c. doses were, according to the Applicant, well tolerated 
and all animals survived the 14-day observation period without major clinical signs. No effects on body 
weight or food consumption were observed. No changes attributable to the test article were found 
during the macroscopic examination.  
Repeat dose toxicity 
Wistar rats were given subcutaneous doses of 50, 150 and 500 μg/kg/day Neukine or the comparator 
Neupogen (150 μg/kg/day) for 28 days. Swellings of the hindlegs or only the joints of the hindlegs 
were noted at all Neukine doses (study number 259.120.897). The same effects were seen in the 
Neupogen group. A dose dependent increase alkaline phosphatase was seen in all animals given 
Neukine at the end of the treatment period. Main macroscopic findings in this study were related to the 
spleen and to the hindlimbs. In the spleen, histiocytosis often combined with increased haemopoiesis 
was detected histologically. The capsule of the spleen was often thickened due to a fibrosis. Increased 
spleen weight was noted in all treated (Neukine and Neupogen) males at 500 μg/kg/day.  A dose-
dependent increase in white blood cells, in particular in neutrophils, was found with Apo-Filgrastim and 
Neupogen, showing equivalent effects. No new toxicities were observed. The toxicities noted were 
comparable and in-line with the expected effects of this class of compound.  
A NOEL was not defined in this study for Neukine or the reference product due to the expected 
pharmacological effects. The toxicokinetic data from this study showed comparability between doses of 
50 and 500 µg/kg Neukine and reference product. 
The design of the GLP-compliant toxicology study 259.120.897 did not include a dose response for 
Neupogen in order to detect differences in toxicology and toxicokinetics response between Apo-
Filgrastim and Neupogen.  
Six studies with Neukine alone were conducted (non-comparative). Swiss albino Mice and Sprague-
Dawley rats were given s.c or i.v doses of 0, 50, 100, 250 μg/kg/day (all studies) for 28 days.  These 
were conducted as separate studies. A further two 28-day studies with 28 day recovery periods were 
also conducted in rats and mice (s.c and i.v). There were no test item-related effects on clinical 
biochemistry, haematology, urinalysis or histopathology changes, except for higher neutrophil counts 
which were expected in treated animals compared to controls. The NOAEL in all of these studies was 
considered to be 250 μg/kg/day. 
Genotoxicity 
No genotoxicity studies were submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies were submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
Reproduction Toxicity 
No reproduction toxicity studies were submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects).

Toxicokinetic data 
Wistar rats were given s.c and i.v doses of 50, 150 and 500 μg/kg/day Neukine s.c or i.v or a 
comparator Neupogen at 50 and 500 μg/kg/day s.c or 50 and 500 mg/kg i.v for 14 days (as part of a 
28-day study). An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to quantify Filgrastim in rat 
plasma. According to the Applicant the rHu(met)G-CSF immunoassay is fully validated and the 
analytics were performed to GLP. Suitable data have been provided on the determination of G-CSF in 
rat serum using ELISA.  
With exception of males at 50 μg/kg, repeated daily i.v administration of Neukine over 14 days 
compared to single i.v doses resulted in a slightly increased exposure, in terms of AUC of rHu G-CSF in 
both sexes. No distinct trend could be observed for Cmax. Comparison of the profiles obtained on day 
0 and 13, showed gender-specific differences, i.e. plasma exposure in terms of AUClast as well as 
Cmax were lower in females, whereas the volume of distribution (Vz_obs) and systemic clearance 
(CLobs) were higher in females. No consistent trend and no consistent gender difference were 
observed for terminal elimination half-life (t1/2). 
With the exception of the low dose (50 μg/kg), repeated daily s.c dosing of Neukine over 14 days 
compared to single s.c dose resulted in a slightly increased exposure of rHu G-CSF in males. No 
distinct trend could be observed for females. No clear trend was seen for Cmax in both sexes, whereas 
systemic clearance CLobs was slightly-to-markedly higher in females. Comparison of the 
pharmacokinetic profiles obtained on day 0 and 13, respectively, did not show consistent gender-
specific differences in terminal elimination half-life (t1/2). Consistent findings after repeated dosing 
were that Cmax of Neukine were slightly lower in females at all doses and exposure to Neukine was 
slightly-to-markedly lower in females. Finally, both the volume of distribution (Vz_obs) and systemic 
clearance (CLobs) of Neukine were markedly increased in females at all doses. 
Local Tolerance  
A GLP compliant rabbit study that compared the local tolerance of Neukine (480 μg Filgrastim per 0.5 
ml acetate buffer pH 4.0) with the reference product (Neupogen) in rabbits after paravenous and 
intramuscular administration was conducted. Moreover, a non-GLP compliant non-comparative rabbit 
local tolerance study was performed with Apo-Filgrastim only. 
In the comparative study, 3 New Zealand white male rabbits were given Apo-Filgrastim and Neupogen 
paravenously and intramuscularly at 480 μg. A visual scale for evaluating erythema formation, oedema 
formation and pain reactions was used. Necropsy was performed on study day 4 (approximately 96 h 
after administration of the test item or reference item). Intramuscular administration of both test 
articles did not cause any erythema formation in all three animals during the observation period of 96 
hours. After paravenous administration two animals developed well defined point-like erythema (grade 
2) at the application site (punctures) within two hours after treatment with Apo-Filgrastim. Within 24 
hours, one animal demonstrated a very slight erythema formation (grade 1) of the treatment area. 96 
hours after administration, two of three application sites recovered and only animal showed a very 
slight erythema formation. Administration of Neupogen caused well defined (grade 2 one animal) to 
moderate (grade 3, one animal) point-like erythema formation at the application site (punctures) in 
two of three animals within 24 hours after treatment. Over the observation period, erythema formation 
lessened to very slight (grade 1). Erythema formation after paravenous administration of both test 
articles was comparable in terms of intensity and incidence. Most of the erythema were point-like and 
in the area of the punctures, so they were considered to have been caused by the administration. 
Neither i.m. or p.v. administration caused visible oedema formation and no signs of pain were noted 
after treatment with either test article during the observation period of 96 hours. Paravenous 
administration of Neukine caused several slight red discolorations in 1 animal. After p.v. administration 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/303037/2013 
Page 17/89 
 
 
 
of the reference Neupogen, 2 animals showed slight hematoma formation and several slight red 
discolorations were noted in 2 animals. 
Histopathological examination showed moderate (grade 3) haematoma at the paravenous 
administration site in 1 animal with Neukine. In comparison, after paravenous treatment with the 
reference item Neupogen, 2 animals developed a slight (grade 2) haematoma. These findings were 
near the injection sites and considered to be caused by the administration volume and / or the route 
and site of administration. No histopathological findings were noted at the intramuscular administration 
sites with either test article.  
It was concluded based on clinical (in-life), macroscopic and histopathological observations that single 
intramuscular and paravenous administration of 480 μg Neukine is well tolerated and comparable to 
480 μg Neupogen. 
Six New Zealand White rabbits were used for evaluating the safety of Neukine by patch test technique 
on intact skin (non-GLP). The hairs were clipped from the back and flanks one day prior to the 
application. Two areas on the back, approximately 2-3 cm apart, were designated for the position of 
control and test product patches in each rabbit. 0.2% SDS was applied as positive control. The patches 
were removed after 24 hours and the skin sites were scored directly after removal and at 48 hours 
after removal using a visual scale. There was no erythema/eschar and oedema formation observed in 
any animal at any time point. Animals treated with positive control patches all showed primary 
irritation indices of > 5 after 48 hours for erythema/eschar formation. 
Other toxicity studies 
No other toxicity studies have been submitted. 
2.3.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Apo-Filgrastim is intended to substitute other identical products on the market, so this product is not 
expected to cause any additional environmental risk. Therefore no environmental risk assessment 
report is required for this product.   
2.3.5.  Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
According to the Guidance on similar medicinal products containing recombinant granulocyte-colony 
stimulating factor (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/31329/2005), safety pharmacology, reproduction toxicology, 
mutagenicity and carcinogenicity studies are not routine requirements for non-clinical testing of similar 
biological medicinal products containing recombinant G-CSF as active substance. The absence of 
secondary pharmacology studies and of studies on pharmacodynamic drug interactions can also be 
considered acceptable based on the extensive experience with and the well-known properties of 
filgrastims. 
Although non-clinical studies have not been conducted with the intended commercial product using the 
intended manufacturing process, receptor binding data for the Apo-Filgrastim DP batches from Process 
VII and IX were submitted for evaluation and comparability was demonstrated. In addition, a recent 
comparative clinical study that investigated the PK/PD profile of Apo-Filgrastim vs. Neupogen (Phase I 
3-arm bridging study) used Process IX (DS) material. Therefore, the CHMP considered that the non-
clinical data obtained with Neukine, containing Process V drug substance, can be extrapolated to the 
Process IX drug substance (Apo-filgrastim) contained in Grastofil. Therefore, from a non-clinical point 
of view, it can be concluded that there were no significant differences between Grastofil and the 
reference medicinal product, Neupogen.

2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The clinical development programme for Grastofil spanned from July 2007 to May 2010. Neupogen was 
the chosen reference product which has been authorised in the Community on the basis of a complete 
dossier in accordance with the provisions of Article 8 of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended. 
The aim of the Apo-Filgrastim clinical program was to demonstrate biosimilarity of Apo-Filgrastim with 
the EU-approved reference product Neupogen. Four comparative Phase I studies were conducted in 
healthy volunteers to demonstrate the equivalence of Apo- Filgrastim with Neupogen in terms of 
pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic parameters: 
•  
A single-dose, randomised, double-blind, two-way cross-over, active-controlled, 
pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) study of i.v. Apo-Filgrastim and Neupogen in 36 
healthy male and female volunteers. (Study KWI-300-101) 
• 
A single-dose, randomised, double-blind, two-way cross-over, active-controlled, 
pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) study of s.c. Apo-Filgrastim and Neupogen in 73 
healthy male and female volunteers with two fixed dose groups of filgrastim (75μg and 150μg). (Study 
KWI-300-102) 
•  
A repeat-dose, randomised, double-blind, parallel group, active and placebo-controlled, 
pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) study of Apo-Filgrastim and Neupogen in 78 healthy 
male and female volunteers (Study KWI-300-103) 
A single dose, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, comparative three-way crossover 
• 
PK and PD study of Apo-Filgrastim and EU- approved and US-licensed Neupogen (Amgen) in 48 
healthy male and female volunteers with a fixed dose of 300 µg. A single -center study conducted in 
Canada (Study GCSF-SUIN-05SB01-3FA – also referred to as Phase I 3-arm Study)

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Study KWI-300-101 
Study Design 
The study design was a single-dose, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, two-way cross-over 
study. Subjects were to be randomized to receive either Neukine (5μg/kg) or the market reference 
filgrastim, Neupogen (5μg/kg, Amgen). 
Healthy subjects were to receive the test product or the reference item intravenously. After a washout 
period, subjects were to receive the alternative G-CSF product. 
The cross-over design was expected to minimise inter-subject variability and therefore lowered the 
required sample size. 
The two subsequent treatments were separated by a sufficient wash out period.  
Statistical and Analysis Plan 
An analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the fixed factors treatment, period, and sequence and the 
random factor subject within sequence was applied for the loge-transformed endpoints AUC0-32, AUC0-
∞, Cmax of filgrastim (PK) and Cmax of the ANC (PD). A 90% confidence interval (CI) for the ratio of 
geometric means Neukine/Neupogen was calculated using the back transformed (exponential) 90% CI 
for the least square mean difference "Neukine - Neupogen". In accordance with the guidance 
documents, the equivalence margin has been set to 80% - 125% for both the pharmacokinetic and the 
pharmacodynamic parameters. 
Efficacy Analysis 
Primary End-point 
-Comparison of the plasma area under curve (AUC) between test and reference filgrastim medicinal 
products.  
Secondary End-points 
- Comparison of Cmax and T½ of filgrastim 
- Comparison of the ANC 
Absorption and Distribution 
Considering the plasma AUC of filgrastim, the initial assumption that between 0 and 32 h after 
administration of G-CSF would cover more than 90% of the total AUC was correct. The increment 
between the AUC0-32 and the AUC0-∞ was marginal (< 1%). A statistical analysis of the AUC0-32 of 
filgrastim showed a highly significant difference between the test item Apo-filgrastim and the reference 
item Neupogen with a probability < 0.0001 (above).  With regard to the relevant confidence intervals, 
however, this difference was within the pre-defined equivalence margins (80% - 125%).

In both treatment groups, mean G-CSF plasma concentrations rapidly increased as expected after i.v. 
infusion, reached a maximum after 16 minutes, and then decreased to pre-dose values at 24 hours. 
With regard to the plasma AUC of filgrastim, the initial assumption that between 0 h and 32 h after 
administration of G-CSF would cover more than 90% of the total AUC was confirmed. The increment 
between the AUC0-32 and the AUC0-∞ was marginal (< 1%). While the statistical analysis of the AUC0-32 
and AUC0-∞ of filgrastim showed a significant difference (p=< 0.0001) between the test item Apo-
Filgrastim and the reference item Neupogen, this difference, however, was within the pre-defined 
equivalence margins (80% - 125%) for the relevant confidence intervals.

Study design  
The study design was a single dose, randomised, double blind, two-way cross-over study. 36 subjects 
of the 1st cohort received either filgrastim Apotex or Neupogen at a dose of 150 μg. 36 subjects of the 
second cohort were randomized to receive either 75μg Filgrastim Apotex or Neupogen. After a washout 
period, subjects receiving one of the filgrastim products then received the other.  
Statistical Analysis Plan 
An analysis of variance was applied for the comparison of Cmax of the ANC between treatment groups 
of the same dosage level (i.e. comparisons between Filgrastim Drug Product 150µg and Neupogen 
150µg and between Filgrastim Drug Product 75µg and Neupogen 75µg). The resulting 90% confidence 
interval for the Cmax ratio Filgrastim Drug Product/Neupogen was compared with the pre-defined 
acceptance region of 80% to 125%, biosimilarity in terms of the primary endpoint is postulated if the 
lower bound is > 80% and the upper bound is < 125%. 
Bioequivalence in terms of the co-primary endpoint was postulated if the lower bound of the 90% CI 
for the AUC0-72 ratio of Filgrastim Drug Product/Neupogen was > 80% and the upper bound was 
< 125%. The same comparison was performed for the co-primary parameter AUC0-∞ and the 
secondary parameter Cmax.

Study design 
The study was a randomised, double-masked, active and placebo-controlled, parallel group, multiple 
dose trial. 
78 healthy male or female subjects were randomised to receive either Filgrastim Drug Product s.c. for 
4 days (5μg/kg/ per day), market reference filgrastim (Neupogen 5μg/kg/per day) s.c. for 4 
consecutive days or placebo (physiological 0.9% NaCl) s.c. for 4 days. A 1:1 randomisation of 
Filgrastim Drug Product versus Neupogen was performed. Six healthy subjects were randomised to the 
placebo group to allow a check of the background in the assay of CD34+ cells. 
Statistical Methods  
The values of the main PD parameters (ANC: Cmax) and PK parameters (Filgrastim: AUC0-24, AUC0-∞, 
Cmax, AUCss) were compared using an ANOVA with the fixed factor treatment and a significance level 
of α = 0.05 after logarithmic transformation of the data. A 90% confidence interval (CI) for the ratio of 
geometric means Filgrastim Drug Product/Neupogen was calculated using the back-transformed 
(exponential) 90% CI for the least square mean difference "Filgrastim Drug Product - Neupogen". If 
this interval is completely contained within pre-defined equivalence margin, biosimilarity was 
postulated. To demonstrate comparability, the equivalence margin has been set, as defined in the 
corresponding guidance documents, to 80% - 125% for all PD and PK parameters.

Study GCSF-SUIN-055BOI-3FA 
Study Design 
As a part of the global development of Apo-Filgrastim and following the manufacturing changes in the 
Apo-Filgrastim drug substance and drug product in terms of the manufacturing scale and addition of 
the a mixed mode chromatography for additional purification, the applicant conducted this study to 
further demonstrate the lack of meaningful differences in the clinical performance of Apo-Filgrastim DP 
from Process II, Apo-Filgrastim DP from Process III and the reference product, EU-approved 
Neupogen. The Phase I 3-arm study was designed as a comparative, single center, randomized, three-
way crossover double-blind study with single-dose subcutaneous administration of 300μg Apo-
Filgrastim, EU-approved Neupogen and US-licensed Neupogen.  
The pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD) and safety endpoints analysed in the study were as 
below: 
−  Primary PK endpoints: AUCt and Cmax of filgrastim 
−  Primary PD endpoints: AUCt and Cmax of ANC 
−  Secondary endpoint: Thalf of filgrastim 
−  Tertiary endpoints: AUCinf, Tmax, Kel of filgrastim 
−  Safety endpoints: Adverse events, lab tests, vital signs and immunogenicity. 
The cross-over study was comprised of three periods involving 6 dosing sequences of the 
investigational product, Apo-Filgrastim, and the comparators US-licensed Neupogen and EU-approved 
Neupogen. A total number of 48 healthy volunteers, in the age range of 18-55 years were dosed in the 
study. Forty-five (45) subjects completed at least two periods of the study and of these, forty (40) 
subjects completed all three periods of the study. Consequently, the safety population included all 
forty-eight (48) randomized subjects since all subjects received at least one administration of the 
study treatment. The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) dataset included forty-five (45) 
subjects, which is in accordance with the protocol that defined the PK/PD population as subjects who 
completed at least two periods of the study. The study duration included three periods, a washout 
between doses and the collection of a blood sample for immunogenicity testing at 240 hours (10 days) 
post-dose in each period. Passive safety surveillance was performed for the duration of 4 months after 
the completion of last study period. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/303037/2013

Blood sampling was scheduled for filgrastim estimation at 0.5, 1.25, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.5, 13, 
15, 18, 24, 30 and 36 hours after dosing. For absolute neutrophil counts (ANC), blood samples were 
drawn prior to dosing time (0 hours) and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 18, 24, 36, 48, 72 and 
96 hours after dosing. 
Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analysis 
A 2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed for each comparison. The ANOVA included 
sequence, subjects nested within sequence, period and treatment as factors. The significance of the 
sequence effect was tested using the subjects nested within sequence as the error term. 
For filgrastim, ANOVA was performed on the log-transformed AUCt, AUCinf and Cmax parameters and on 
the untransformed Tmax, Kel and Thalf parameters of filgrastim and for ANC data, ANOVA was performed 
on the log-transformed AUCt and Cmax parameters. In addition, ANOVA was performed on the 
untransformed Tmax parameter (PROC GLM of SAS® v8.2 software). 
The two one-sided hypothesis was tested at the α=0.05 level of significance for the AUCt, AUCinf and 
Cmax parameters of filgrastim and for the AUCt and Cmax parameters of ANC by constructing the 90% 
confidence interval for the ratio between the test and reference means. Additionally, a supplementary 
analysis conducted on the ANC data using a higher alpha level of significance (a = 0.025) leading to 
the calculation of a 95% confidence interval has been performed. 
Methods

Analytical methods 
The analytical reports used for the PK and immunogenicity analysis of the Apo-Filgrastim clinical 
studies submitted were: 
1.  ELISA for measurement of G-CSF in plasma 
2.  Immunogenicity assays 
a.  Screening ELISA 
b.  Confirmation of positive samples (depletion with G-CSF) 
c.  Neutralising cell based proliferation assay  
ELISA for PK estimation 
A commercially available Human G-CSF sandwich enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kit was used.  
A complete validation of analytical method has been provided. The validation parameters of this study 
include, intra and inter-assay precision and accuracy of the back calculated concentration for the 
calibration standards, the inter- and intra-assay precision and accuracy of the QCs and the method 
total error as well as the short-term stability analysis.  
The in-study validation for the three Phase 1 studies was submitted and shows acceptable calibrations 
standards and QCs values.  
The PK sample analysis was completed within less than five months of the sample collection for all 
three studies. The long-term stability for GCSF was at least five months to cover the above period of 
storage. 
Immunogenicity assays 
The anti-drug antibody (ADA) analysis involved the following steps:

Step 1: A Screening assay performed on all human serum samples for detecting the presence of the 
IgG and IgM antibodies. 
Step 2: A Confirmation assay to confirm the positive results obtained in the Screening assay. 
Step 3: A Neutralising assay on confirmed results from Step 2, to evaluate the positive samples for 
their G-CSF neutralising potential in a Bioassay.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Filgrastim exercises its action by binding to specific G-CSF receptors on the cell surface. Binding 
studies indicate two types of receptors: low affinity 100-130 kDa monomer receptors and high-affinity 
oligomeric receptors. Its action on G-CSF receptors promotes the growth, proliferation, differentiation, 
and maturation of neutrophil precursors and enhances the function of mature neutrophils by increasing 
phagocytic activity and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Its activity also mobilises 
haemopoietic progenitor cells from bone marrow into peripheral blood.

Considering the PD parameter Cmax of ANC, there was no statistically significant difference between 
both study medications (probability = 0.8972) and the confidence intervals were within the pre-defined 
equivalence margins (80% - 125%). It is therefore concluded that the observed difference in the 
pharmacokinetics between the test item Neukine and the reference item Neupogen of filgrastim is not 
relevant for the PD effect in terms of ANC stimulation in humans. This result is emphasized when 
considering the results obtained by univariate statistical analysis of the AUC0-72 of the ANC yielding 
almost identical values for both the test item Neukine and the reference item Neupogen with regard to 
the PP population and the ITT population too.

Table 43: Summary of PD/Statistical Results for ANC Cmax and AUC t Parameters in Clinical 
Phase I PK/PD Studies with Apo-Filgrastim (Neukine) and Neupogen (PP Population) 
In order to further demonstrate that this dose is indeed on the ascending portion of the dose response 
curve even for ANC, the ANC AUCs for Neupogen in each of the Phase I studies (and hence at each 
dose ranging from 1 to 5 μg/kg) in Apo-Filgrastim clinical program were evaluated for trend over dose. 
Since study KWI-300-103 was a multiple-dose study, in order to have data that is comparable to that 
of the other single dose studies (KWI-300-102 Cohort 1 and Cohort 2), the ANC AUC0-24h for all 
studies was used for assessment. The ANC AUC0-24h value for Neupogen in each of these studies is 
tabulated below in the table below.

Figure 12: Assessment of ANC AUEC* following Single Dose Administration of Neupogen and 
Apo-Filgrastim and Multiple Dose Administration of Neupogen 
To demonstrate that single-dose studies were equally as sensitive in detecting PD differences between 
test and reference products as multiple dose studies, the Applicant presented a  review of the data 
which showed that the difference observed between Apo-Filgrastim and Neupogen following the 
administration of a single dose (i.e. AUC0-24) is essentially the same as the difference observed after 
the administration of multiple doses (i.e. 4 daily doses) of filgrastim (AUC0-96); approximately 3.6% 
and 4.4% respectively. The ANC Cmax data revealed the same. Thus, despite altered levels of 
expression of G-CSF receptors and altered disposition of filgrastim under a multiple-dose setting, these 
results suggest that a single dose setting is expected to be as sensitive as a multiple dose setting in 
ascertaining differences between filgrastim medicinal products. Accordingly, the available single dose 
data for Apo-Filgrastim at low doses (i.e. 1 µg/kg (75 µg) and 2 µg/kg (150 µg) should provide 
assurance of clinical similarity following the multiple dose administration of corresponding low doses.

It should be noted that there is limited available data in the literature to compare the response 
following low dose administration of filgrastim.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of Apo-filgrastim were initially investigated in three studies in healthy human 
subjects – a single 5µg/kg intravenous dose study, a 75µg and 150µg single subcutaneous dose study 
and a repeat subcutaneous dose 5µg/kg/day study. The choice of enrolling healthy subjects in order to 
minimise variability, which may complicate evaluation of PK equivalence, is endorsed. 
In general, the studies were well run and prior to commencement, scientific advice was sought from 
the CHMP. The main divergence from this advice was to maintain the placebo group in the 3-arm 
multiple-dose study, KWI-300-103, in order to help demonstrate assay sensitivity instead of replacing 
it with another study arm where subjects would be administered a different dose of Apo-filgrastim (2.5 
or 10µg/kg). This was considered problematic as the Apo-filgrastim development programme then 
lacked comparative repeated-dose data at two dose levels, which would allow convincing 
demonstration of PK equivalence.    
The methods for quantification of the study treatments in serum included a commercial ELISA and 
were adequately validated. The validation of the screening, confirmatory and neutralising 
immunogenicity assays was acceptable.    
A new study, GCSF-SUIN-05SB01-3FA (Phase I 3-arm), was submitted during the procedure. The 
objective of the study was to demonstrate that Grastofil manufactured using drug substance from 
manufacturing Process IX and proposed commercial drug product from Process III was similar in terms 
of PK/PD to EU-approved Neupogen. Thus the aim of the study was to bridge the existing clinical data 
for Apo-Filgrastim (DP process II, and DS Process VII) vs the comparator. The study demonstrated 
that a single administration sc of 300µg of Grastofil manufactured with the final process intended for 
the marketed product is comparable, in terms of PK/PD, to the reference test products. In addition, the 
marketed reference products, Neupogen Europe and USA were comparable as expected. For the 
primary pharmacokinetic endpoint parameters AUCt and Cmax for filgrastim, the 90% confidence 
intervals were contained within the pre-defined acceptance range of 80-125% for all formulation 
comparisons. 
PK data were analysed using ANOVA on log-transformed data with terms for sequence, subject within 
sequence, period and treatment. This is the analysis requested in the CHMP bioequivalence guideline. 
The acceptance limits set for the confidence intervals of the differences were in line with those outlined 
in the CHMP bioequivalence guideline. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/303037/2013 
Page 44/89 
 
 
 
 
The principle PK issue arose from the results of Study KWI-300-101 and Study GCSF-SUIN-05SB01-
3FA. For Study KWI-300-101 the statistical analysis of the AUC0-32 and AUC0-∞ of filgrastim showed a 
highly significant difference (p=< 0.0001) between the point estimates for the test item Apo-Filgrastim 
and the reference item Neupogen. In Study GCSF-SUIN-05SB01-3FA as in KWI-300-101 there were 
seen to be statistically significant differences in PK outputs between Neupogen and Grastofil. On the 
other hand, the CHMP acknowledged that in the comparative healthy volunteer studies, for all the main 
PK parameters, the 90% confidence intervals of the ratios of the means were fully contained within the 
80-125% acceptance limits, in line with the guidance provided in the CHMP Guideline on the 
Investigation of Bioequivalence (January 2010). Although the usual acceptance criteria for 
bioequivalence were met, these 'bioassays' constituted a signal of differences between 
formulations that needed to be investigated prior to a conclusion of biosimilarity being drawn.  
By way of providing justification for the confidence intervals of the PK ratios not encompassing 100% 
in the intravenous dose study and in study GCSF-SUIN-05SB01-3FA, the Applicant indicated that the 
results were likely due to the low variability of the PK data in study KWI-300-101 as a result of having 
more subjects than required in the study and due to the nature of the intravenous dose model, which 
is usually associated with lower variability than the subcutaneous dose model. This justification was 
supported with data from the relevant studies. However, it should be noted that the variability has a 
significant impact on the width of the confidence intervals and not as great an effect on the point 
estimate, which showed approximately 10% differences between test and reference products. 
Therefore, the effect of variability on the differences seen was considered marginal. It was agreed that 
the differences were unlikely to result from differences in the sensitivities of the PK assay to Apo-
filgrastim and Neupogen. Whilst the explanation for the PK differences in the two studies has not been 
definitively identified, it should be noted that for the majority of the PK output comparisons, 
differences as regards the point estimates were smaller and not statistically significant. In an exercise 
consisting of multiple comparisons of PK end points it is conceivable that for a few, significant or 
somewhat larger differences may be demonstrated, going against trends otherwise seen in the data.  
Ultimately and importantly, the lack of significant differences with regard to PD outcomes in the studies 
in question provided significant reassurance that for studies KWI-300-101 and GCSF-SUIN-05SB01-
3FA the noted PK differences were unlikely to be indicative of clinically meaningful differences between 
the test and reference products or to lead to differences in PD response and clinical effect.  
Process II material tended to provide PK concentrations lower than Neupogen (particularly in study 
KWI-300-101). For process III product (study GCSF-SUIN-05SB01-3FA) the values were statistically 
significantly higher. While it is difficult to directly compare the products of the two processes using 
these data, it seems possible that they would not be bioequivalent to each other, creating concern that 
the efficacy and in particular, given the higher levels, safety data from trial KWI-300-104, cannot be 
extrapolated to process III product. However, there are a number of uncertainties surrounding this 
observation. For the majority of the PK readouts the differences between test-reference ratios for 
process II and III products were modest. Also, the lowest ratios occurred in the 5mcg/kg intravenous 
dose study i.e. a different method of administration and dose from the new GCSF-SUIN-05SB01-3FA 
study. Further, the comparisons discussed above were made across studies. This can be associated 
with significant uncertainties with regard to data interpretation. Most importantly, PK evaluation of 
products of both processes showed the confidence intervals of the ratios of test and reference products 
to fall fully within the agreed acceptance limits and in the end, the aforementioned differences could 
simply reflect biological variability and not indicate true differences between materials. Lastly, it is 
acknowledged that a reasonable Quality comparability exercise was undertaken by the Applicant.  The 
exercise sufficiently demonstrated that Apo-Filgrastim drug substance and drug product from the 
clinical stages of process development and from the proposed commercial process were comparable 
with one another and to the reference product, Neupogen. In addition, there were similar receptor 
binding data presented in the non-clinical section of the dossier for the process II and III products, 
Assessment report

Page 45/89 
 
 
 
further supporting the comparability of the two products. Accordingly, given the positive PK/PD data 
from study GCSF-SUIN-05SB01-3FA suggesting similarity of Grastofil (process III product) to 
Neupogen and supportive data from the Quality and non-clinical comparability exercises, comparability 
of process II and process III products could be accepted.  
As regards any uncertainty in the parameters used to determine bioequivalence, data for the 
parameters AUC0-24, AUC0-inf, CMAX for all 3 PK/PD studies showed the CIs for ratios to be contained 
within 80-125% limits regardless of analysis population (PP, ITT, sensitivity). Any concerns therefore 
that in study KWI-300-101 AUC0-32 rather than AUC0-inf was primarily used for the comparability 
exercise could be rested as there was shown to be <1% difference between the two AUC parameters, 
with confidence intervals for the ratios of both falling within the standard acceptance limits.  
The T1/2 and clearance summary statistics did not suggest any important differences between the test 
and reference products. There were some gaps however in the PK data presentation. Most noticeable 
was the lack of comparison of CMAX, AUC0-∞, and AUC0-72 parameters for the 75µg dose in study KWI-
300-102. It was clarified by the Applicant that PK sampling for patients administered this dose was not 
undertaken in the study. This was noted in the study protocol.  Time dependency was evaluated with 
the repeat dose study KWI-300-103, where similarity for the main PK parameters was demonstrated at 
only one dose level on study Days 1 and 4 and from 1 through 4.   
Given that the conditions of PK similarity have been met, in line with the Guideline on the Investigation 
of Bioequivalence, the Applicant’s justifications of the small but statistically significant differences in PK 
measures in studies KWI-300-101 and GCSF-SUIN-05SB01-3FA and assertions that these are unlikely 
to result in significant differences in PD or clinical effect between Grastofil and Neupogen were 
considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
ANC CMAX was selected as the primary pharmacodynamic outcome measure for the three initial studies 
in healthy subjects. For study GCSF-SUIN-05SB01-3FA AUCt was selected. In the CHMP biosimilar 
guideline for recombinant G-CSF products evaluation of comparability of ANC is mandated. However, a 
specific parameter has not been recommended. Whilst the use of ANC Cmax as the parameter of choice 
in the comparability exercise can be supported, it was expected that the relevant ANC AUC parameters 
would also be presented.  
In the three initial PK/PD studies, as was seen for the PK outcomes, the estimates for the PD outcomes 
of the test product usually trailed those of the reference product. For the majority of the presented 
outcomes the differences were not statistically significant and the confidence intervals of the 
differences between the means were contained within the 80-125% limits set by the Applicant.  
Notably, in study KWI-300-02, where lower Apo-filgrastim doses were administered, significant 
differences for ANC CMAX and ANC AUC0-72 were seen between test and reference cohorts for the 75µg 
dose. It has previously been noted that PD differences between G-CSF products may be heightened in 
comparability exercises involving low G-CSF doses.  
The data presented by the Applicant seemed to suggest that similarity between test and reference 
products, with regard to PD outcomes, had been demonstrated. However, the acceptance limits of 80-
125% used had not been fully justified and were considered too wide for demonstration of PD similarity 
within this biosimilar application; and more so for a package where comparative clinical efficacy and 
safety data from patients were not available. The Applicant was asked  to re-present the PD data 
across the 4 Apo-filgrastim PK/ PD studies using 95% confidence intervals, as is recommended for 
evaluation of PD data for biosimilar applications, and tighter acceptance limits.  +/- 10%, which was 
acceptable, was discussed by the Applicant and it was agreed that such limits would be stringent 
enough to ensure PD equivalence.  As expected, the 95% confidence intervals of the ratios were 
slightly wider than the corresponding 90% confidence intervals, with the majority straddling 100% but 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/303037/2013 
Page 46/89 
 
 
 
comfortably contained within the narrower 90-111% acceptance limits; a fact which strongly suggested 
similarity of the PD data.  However, for ANC Cmax and ANC AUC0-inf   (where the effect of whole 
curve is considered) of the 75µg dose in study KWI-300-102 and for the key PD data of multiple-dose 
study KWI-300-103 (both 0-24 and 0-96 estimates), the lower bounds of the 95% confidence intervals 
fell below 90%. Further, the CIs for ANC Cmax and ANC AUC0-inf of the 75µg dose fell entirely below 
100% (≈87-97% and ≈87-98%, respectively). 
The Applicant argued that the excursions past the lower limit of the acceptance margins were minimal 
and that in both cases these were likely due to the lack of sufficient study power, as the more stringent 
limits were applied retrospectively and therefore not taken into consideration when calculating the 
study sample size. Analyses using coefficient of variation data from the study were provided, showing 
the larger sample sizes required to provide adequate power for the CIs to be contained within the more 
stringent acceptance limits. For the study KWI-300-103 results, the variability of response was further 
compounded by the inter-individual variability associated with the parallel group design (and not 
associated with a cross-over study design), hence the larger and more frequent excursions past the 
lower acceptance margin in the multiple-dose study. Again, some data from study KWI-300-103 was 
provided to support this assertion. However, it was not considered to conclusively explain the apparent 
lack of PD similarity in the Apo-filgrastim studies, as larger studies, where sample sizes would have 
been calculated based on narrower PD acceptance limits, have not been conducted (particularly in a 
repeated-dose setting). As discussed below, these PD data did not automatically preclude the 
demonstration of PD similarity. Reassuringly, despite the studies not being powered such that 95% 
confidence intervals of the PD ratios would be contained within narrow limits, for three of the five 
dosing regimens evaluated this was the case. For the remaining regimens (noted above), the 
excursions past the lower bound of the narrower acceptance limit were small, as were the mean 
differences seen between the PD outputs of the test and reference products. 
The Applicant argued that the PD differences seen will not have relevant consequences in daily clinical 
practice. The main justification was that in the KWI-300-104 study the objective endpoint of DNS in 
breast cancer was in line with the results expected for G-CSF treatments evidenced by data from 
published literature. However, the data lacked direct objective comparison to the reference product 
and therefore, for the purposes of this exercise, were of limited value. More persuasive was the 
discussion of factors which render the small apparent differences in PD between Grastofil and 
Neupogen irrelevant in clinical practice; for instance, pharmacodynamic sequelae of increased 
neutrophil counts in the low dosage repeated-dose setting, the practice of dosing to response and the 
safety of G-CSF over a broad range of doses.  
The discussion above, particularly regarding the extent of the confidence interval excursions past the 
lower bound of the narrower acceptance limit in a minority of dosing regimens and the robustness of 
the estimates of the PD ratios in the other regimens, supported (in this case) the adoption of a more 
flexible approach with regard to the recommended width of the acceptance limit for the CIs of PD 
ratios. It is important to note that comparability of the physicochemical characteristics and functional 
attributes of the molecules (critical parts of the comparability exercise for filgrastims) had already been 
evaluated and confirmed in the Quality and Non-clinical sections of the dossier, providing further 
reassurance that PD differences seen between the test and reference products were unlikely to reflect 
clinically significant differences between the products.  
The Applicant provided data on geometric means of the test and reference products along with the 
corresponding ratios of the means and confidence intervals for Apo-Filgrastim, Neupogen and 
Filgrastim Hexal, as was requested in order to justify that the 5 µg/Kg dose sits on the most sensitive 
part of the dose-response curve. In addition, a revised dose-response plot was provided for the three 
products.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/303037/2013 
Page 47/89 
 
 
 
Regarding the plot, the rationales for plotting ANC AUC0-24 (AUEC0-24) rather than 0-72, and for 
omitting the single dose IV data were provided. Whilst the choice of PD parameter to present had to 
suffice, due to limitations resulting from the limited amount of data from the development programme, 
it should be noted that AUEC0-24 data only relates to approximately 50% of the ANC vs time curve in 
the single-dose model. Therefore, it is unclear whether the shape of the Apo-Ffilgrastim dose response 
curve would have been noticeably altered if the total ANC response (e.g. AUEC0-inf or 0-72) was 
plotted and if data from a single subcutaneous dose 5µg/kg study had been available. Somewhat 
reassuringly, data from the Neupogen arms in the Grastofil dossier and from multiple-dose filgrastim 
Hexal studies were plotted, with the gradients (and shape) of their dose-response curves 
approximating those of Apo-filgrastim.  Overall, the plots seemed to suggest that the 5 µg/kg dose sits 
on as steep a part of the dose-response curve as the 1µg/kg dose. Further, there was no clear 
suggestion that the dose-response plateaued at 5µg/kg. These conclusions were supported by the 
dose-response plot for Filgrastim-Hexal which mirrored that for Apo-filgrastim and was based on 
robust data.    
The Applicant also outlined analyses from study KWI-300-103 which appeared to demonstrate that the 
difference observed between Apo-Filgrastim and Neupogen following the administration of a single 
dose (i.e. AUC0-24) was essentially the same as the difference observed after the administration of 
multiple doses (i.e. 4 daily doses) of filgrastim (AUC0-96); approximately 3.6% and 4.4% respectively. 
The same effect was seen for Cmax. Previous comments regarding suitability of using the AUEC0-24 for 
these analyses notwithstanding, the data from the study seemed to suggest that the AUEC0-24 
parameter may be at least equally sensitive at detecting differences in PD between the test and 
reference products as the AUEC0-96 parameter from a multiple-dose study. This was supported by a 
plausible and well-reasoned pharmacodynamic rationale regarding receptor activation, ANC response 
and receptor mediated uptake of G-CSF within the dossier.   
Given the above, it could be concluded that the single-dose studies in healthy volunteers evaluating 
the 4 µg/Kg and 2 µg/Kg doses were equally sensitive as the 1 µg/Kg single-dose and 5 µg/Kg 
multiple-dose studies in detecting PD differences between test and reference products. Therefore, the 
significance of excursions of the PD ratio CIs past narrow limits in the latter studies should not be 
overstated. 
The evaluation of CD34+ response to Apo-filgrastim and Neupogen was inadequate. The Day 5 
outcomes in study KWI-300-103 were presented without statistical comparison. In addition, sampling 
in that study was sparse. Therefore, robust comparison of test and reference for this outcome did not 
occur. In addition, no further comparative CD34+ data were available from the development 
programme. It is agreed that the available data for CD34+ from studies KWI-300-103 and KWI-300-
104 demonstrated the response to Apo-Filgrastim with regard to CD34+ mobilisation and that the 
response to Apo-filgrastim and Neupogen appeared close. However, the robust data from statistical 
evaluation of comparability of response, as would normally be expected for a key secondary PD 
outcome measure within a biosimilar package, could not be provided. Lack of robust data on CD34+ 
comparability was considered a significant deficiency in the PD similarity exercise. However, PD 
similarity is strongly supported by pivotal ANC AUC (AUEC) and ANC Cmax data from a number of 
studies (as discussed above). Furthermore, the available CD34+ data, whilst not assessed by formal 
criteria to determine similarity, were considered to be in keeping with a similarity conclusion based on 
the ANC endpoints. Therefore, based on current knowledge of G-CSF, biosimilar filgrastims and G-CSF 
analogue activity at the G-CSF receptor, given that test-to-reference comparability has been 
determined in quality, non-clinical and clinical comparability exercises, the CHMP did not expect CD34+ 
response to Grastofil and Neupogen to differ in a clinically significant manner in healthy individuals and 
patients.

2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the differences seen between the PD outputs of the products were quite small. Also the 
evidence suggested that doses 1-5µg/kg sit on the steep and linear part of the dose response curve 
and that the single-dose studies were equally sensitive as the multiple-dose study (based on data in 
the dossier) in detecting PD differences between the test and reference products. Given the above, the 
supporting points outlined by the Applicant and the overall PD data, it may be concluded that PD 
similarity has been demonstrated between Grastofil and Neupogen and that the differences seen in the 
multiple-dose study were unlikely to have consequences in clinical practice.

Treatments 
Repeated doses of Neukine (Apo-Filgrastim) 5 μg/kg/day rounded by the nearest prefilled syringe size 
were administered subcutaneously (s.c.) as daily injection. Correspondingly, study patients received 
300 μg (if body weight 40-75 kg) or 480 μg (if body weight 76-120 kg) Neukine daily. 
Treatment with Neukine began on day 2 of every chemotherapy cycle (at least 24 hours after 
chemotherapy) and was continued up to 14 days or until post-nadir ANC recovery to normal or near-
normal values by laboratory standards, whichever occurred first.  
After day 10, blood sampling may have been continued daily until a documented ANC of up to 10.0 x 
109/L after the expected nadir or for up to a maximum of 14 days, whichever occurred first if clinically 
indicated. Neukine  was administered daily for a maximum up to study cycle Day 15, but must have 
been stopped if patients had an ANC > 10 x 109/L. 
Dose Reduction or Alteration 
Chemotherapy dose reduction by 25% was permitted, as per the Protocol, if subjects experienced 
grade 3/4 non hematopoietic toxicities, two grade 3/4 infectious episodes, or grade 4 
thrombocytopenia.  
Discontinuation of treatment was to be considered for patients in whom non-hematologic grade 4 toxic 
effects developed or persisted according to the National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria 
(NCI-CTC), or grade 3 toxic effects occurred despite a dose reduction, or a clinically significant cardiac 
event developed. 
Premedication for Chemotherapy 
Dexamethasone (six doses of 8 mg p.o. BID, starting the day before chemotherapy and ending the 
evening of the day after chemotherapy) were administered in order to prevent docetaxel-related 
Assessment report

hypersensitivity and fluid retention. Ondansetron was administered according to the manufacturer’s 
prescribing information.  
Concomitant Therapy 
Chemotherapy 
•  
•  
•  
Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 i.v. day 1, 
Doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 i.v. day 1, 
Cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 i.v. day 1, every 3 weeks for six cycles. 
Dose of antineoplastic agents was calculated according to Mosteller equation in the Protocol: body 
surface area (BSA) (m2) = [Ht(cm) * Wt(kg) / 3600 ]½ Upon consultation with the study medical 
monitor, investigators were allowed to deviate from the equation limiting the dose to the equivalent of 
2 m2, if this was local site practice. Any intent of dose reduction or deviation from the administration 
schedule was reported to Medical Monitor before the implementation of deviation.  
Other Concomitant Treatment 
Any treatment considered necessary for the patient's welfare could be given at the discretion of the 
investigator. 
Primary prophylactic antibiotic therapy was not allowed in line with the recommendations of NCCN, 
Practice Guidelines in Oncology, Myeloid growth factors, V.1.2008. Secondary antibiotic prophylaxis 
was allowed upon development of episode of FN and implemented in accordance with the 
recommendations of NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology: NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in 
Oncology, V.I. 2008. 
If the administration of a non-permitted concomitant medication became necessary, participation to 
the study was discontinued prematurely in this patient. Use of other concurrent hematopoietic growth 
factors was not allowed. 
Objectives 
Primary objective: 
•  To evaluate the safety of Neukine (Apo-Filgrastim) used for the reduction in duration of 
neutropenia in breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint  
•  Duration of severe neutropenia in cycle 1. Severe neutropenia was defined as occurrence of 
ANC below 0.5 x 109/L). 
Primary safety endpoint 
•  Subject incidence of adverse events (AEs) (all severe and serious) classified by body system, 
preferred term (PT), frequency, and relationship to investigational product. Vital signs, the 
presence of antibodies and clinical laboratory results were also monitored. 
Secondary endpoints 
• 
The duration of severe neutropenia in consecutive cycles (2 through 6); 
•  The frequency of grade 3 and 4 severe neutropenia (ANC below 1.0 x 109/l and 0.5 x 109/l); 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/303037/2013 
Page 51/89 
 
 
 
•  The depth of ANC nadir in cycle 1; 
•  The time to the post nadir ANC recovery (ANC >1,5 X 109) in cycle 1; 
•  The rates of febrile neutropenia (FN) by cycle and across the cycles; 
•  The definition of FN used for the purpose of the Protocol was an observed or imputed ANC 
•  <0.5 x 109/L and concurrent oral equivalent temperature ≥38.2
C; 
•  The ANC-time profile in cycle 1 (Time from the beginning of chemotherapy to the 
⁰
• 
occurrence of ANC nadir); 
•  The frequency of a nadir of less than 0.5 x 109/l and less than 1.0 x 109/l ANC; 
•  The frequency of (culture-confirmed) infections; 
•  The incidence of i.v. antibiotic therapy and hospitalization; 
•  The mobilization of CD34+ cells (in selected sites only). 
Sample size 
A cohort of 100 eligible patients was expected to provide 95% certainty of detecting one report of a 
specific AE when there is a 3-4% probability that it occurs. As there was no active comparator in this 
study, Neukine's spectrum of AEs was compared to the events historically documented for Neupogen in 
its Summary of Product Characteristics. One hundred patients was considered adequate to detect 
whether these common effects occur to a similar extent and to detect any other AEs occurring with a 
frequency of more than 3%. Based on previous publications (Green et al. 2003) dropout rate of less 
than 20% was expected. 
Randomisation 
Not applicable 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was open-label.  
Statistical methods 
Analysis of Efficacy 
The efficacy analysis was purely descriptive and exploratory and based upon descriptive summary 
statistics. The efficacy analysis was performed for FAS and PP subsets.  
The main efficacy endpoint was the duration of severe neutropenia (defined as occurrence of ANC 
below 0.5 x 109/L) in cycle 1. Duration was presented by means of summary statistics. Frequency 
table was created to summarise the incidences of severe neutropenia by day of onset, and the number 
of patients experiencing severe neutropenia for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 etc days. 
Analysis of Safety 
Extent of Exposure 
The number of days until ANC recovery is calculated from the day of TAC administration (Day 1) till 
date of ANC recovery which is determined according to decision of investigator. 
Assessment report

Adverse Events 
All AEs (as well as medical history terms) were coded centrally using MedDRA Version 10.0. 
Summaries and analysis were based on the treatment-emergent AEs (referred to AEs in this 
document), which are defined as AEs occurring on or after the day of the first study drug 
administration, or AE present before this day and ongoing after administration with increased severity. 
Clinical Laboratory Evaluation 
The number of patients who had values outside normal values and by listing values considered 
clinically relevant by the investigator were presented.   
Immunogenicity  
Any patient who did not have antibodies at screening, but showed at least one positive sample during 
the study (which is not a singular positive sample followed by negative samples) was presented as 
“positive” in data tables. This definition applies to both binding and neutralising.

Overall, 113 patients (94.17%) completed the treatment period and 109 (90.83%) completed the 
Safety Follow-up period. 11 patients (9.17%) prematurely discontinued the study. The most common 
reason for study discontinuation was patient’s withdrawal of consent and Sponsor’s decision. 5 patients 
(4.16%) discontinued due to withdrawal of consent. Three patients (2.50%) were discontinued by the 
Sponsor due to serious protocol deviation. Three patients (2.50%) discontinued due to AEs: The first 2 
events were reported as SAEs and led to fatal outcomes due to metastases and disease progression. 
The third was due to a non-serious AE of duodenal ulcer. None of these events were considered related 
to the study drug

In the PP analysis subset, the duration was even lower with mean (SD) duration of 1.27 (0.95) days. 
Shorter duration in the PP subset is due to removal of patients with deviations from the study drug 
administration regimen who were excluded from the FAS.  
Subgroup analysis indicated that there is a statistically significant positive correlation between the 
duration of severe neutropenia and depth of nadir in cycle 1 and earlier day of onset of severe 
neutropenia. Patients with Neukine dose of 4.5 – 5.2 μg/kg/day had a statistically significant shorter 
duration of severe neutropenia then patients with either higher or lower Neukine dose. On the other 
hand there was no correlation with patient age, weight, pre-filled syringe size or dose of 
chemotherapy. 
Secondary Efficacy Variables 
Duration of Severe Neutropenia in Consecutive Cycles (2 - 6) 
Blood sampling in cycles 2-6 was performed at cycle day 9. As severe neutropenia most often occurred 
on cycle day 7, the neutropenia had most probably recovered in the majority of patients by the time of 
blood sampling at day 9. Indeed, severe neutropenia was detected in only 4 out of 114 (3.51%), 8 out 
of 114 (7.02%), 5 out of 114 (4.38%), 9 out of 113 (7.96%) and 12 out of 113 (10.62%) patients in 
cycles 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 respectively.

Grade 3 neutropenia occurred in 106 (88.33%), while severe (grade 4) neutropenia occurred in 93 
(77.50%) patients in cycle 1. Frequency was apparently lower in subsequent cycles, but this is at least 
partly due to lower frequency of blood sampling and the scheduled sampling time point on day 9 of the 
chemotherapy cycles.

Time to Post-nadir ANC Recovery (ANC >1.5 X 109) in Cycle 1 
Time to ANC Recovery was defined as the number of days until post nadir ANC value > 1.5 x 109/l, 
relative to chemotherapy administration. Recovery occurred after a median of 9 and mean (SD) 9.11 
(1.32) days. 
Rates of Febrile Neutropenia by Cycle and Across the Cycles 
Three study patients experienced FN, all 3 cases being in cycle 1. The rate of FN was 2.5 % in cycle 1 
and 0% for all other cycles. Notably, patient 1 was removed from the PP subset due to major protocol 
deviation of discontinuation of Neukine administration pre-nadir and dosing with marketed formulation 
of filgrastim. This patient received only 2 doses of Neukine before developing FN. 1 Patient received 10 
doses while another received 8 doses of Neukine in cycle 1.  
The ANC-time Profile in Cycle 1 
Severe neutropenia occurred most frequently on day 7 of cycle 1, with the day of onset ranging from 
day 5 to day 9.

Frequency of (Culture-confirmed) Infections 
One patient had culture confirmed infections in cycle 1. Three concomitantly occurring infections were 
culture confirmed: cough, stomatitis and rhinitis. In another patient with FN before initiation of i.v. 
antibiotics a blood culture result was positive for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. This was 
taken as sign of contamination and not as bacteraemia, given the general health status of the patient 
(feeling well, febrile, without signs/symptoms of infection).  
Intravenous Antibiotic Therapy and Hospitalisation 
Intravenous antibiotics were used in 4 (3.33%) of patients. Febrile neutropenia was the indication for 2 
cases. All patients were hospitalized and events reported as SAEs.

Hospitalisation during treatment and follow-up periods was necessary in 8 cases for 7 (5.83%) of

Mobilisation of CD34+ Cells 
CD34+ cell counts were performed at selected sites and for a total of 39 randomly selected patients. 
Three samples were taken from patients in cycle 1. Broad interindividual variation in the capacity of 
patients to mobilize progenitor cells was noted, a finding that is in line with literature reports.

Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Status 
At screening, 100 patients had ECOG score 0, 19 patients had score 1 and 1 patient had score 2. 
Overall improvement was noted by the end of the study (week 48) with the number of patients at 
score 0 increasing to 106, the number of patients at score 1 decreasing to 3 and no patients having 
score above 1. It is noted that this does not account for patient who dropped out of the study for 
whom ECOG status was not assessed. 
Transfusions Used to Treat Thrombocytopenia and Anaemia 
Transfusion of erythrocytes and blood were required in one patient on 3 occasions. This patient started 
the study with decreased erythrocyte count of 3.53x 1012/l. She received the first transfusion while in 
chemotherapy Cycles 3, 5 and 6. Severe anaemia, not related to Neukine was recorded as the 
indication for the transfusions. No transfusions of thrombocytes were required.  
Chemotherapy Dose Delivered 
Chemotherapy dose reduction was required in 4 (3.33%) patients, so that 13 out of 688 (1.88%) 
chemotherapy cycles were delivered at a 25% reduced dose. Two of the patients had dose reduced due 
to chemotherapy related fatigue while the others due to low ANC, which in one case resulted in FN. 
Chemotherapy Cycle Delay 
Dose delay was considered as any dose which was more than 23 days after the previous. Sixteen out 
of 688 (2.3%) cycles were delayed, mostly due to technical and patient personal reasons. The only AEs 
which may be related to chemotherapy and insufficient ANC recovery are the skin inflammation in one 
patient and low ANC in another.

Comparison to the Reference Product 
The prescribing information (PI) for the reference product Neupogen states that in the phase 3‚ 
randomised‚ double-blind‚ placebo-controlled study conducted in patients with small cell lung cancer (n 
= 99) patients were randomised to receive NEUPOGEN  (n = 99) starting on day 4‚ after receiving 
standard dose chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide‚ doxorubicin‚ and etoposide. For patients 
receiving Neupogen the incidence of at least one infection over all cycles of chemotherapy was 40% 
(40/99), the incidence of hospitalization was 52% (51/99), the incidence of i.v antibiotic usage in cycle 
1 was 38% (38/99) and the incidence of severe neutropenia in cycle 1 was 84% (83/99). Over all 
cycles‚ patients had a 57% (286/500 cycles) rate of severe neutropenia. The median duration of 
severe neutropenia in cycle 1 was 2 days (range 0 to 9 days) and the mean duration of neutropenia in 
cycle 1 was 2.44 +/- 1.90 days. Over all cycles‚ the median duration of neutropenia was 1 day. The 
median severity of neutropenia (as measured by ANC nadir) was 72/mm3 (range 0/mm3 to 7912/mm3) 
in cycle 1. The mean severity of neutropenia in cycle 1 was 496/mm3 +/- 1382/mm3. Over all cycles‚ 
the ANC nadir was 403/mm3. 
In a randomised, double-blind‚ placebo-controlled‚ multi-centre‚ phase 3 clinical study‚ 521 patients 
(median age 54‚ range 16 to 89 years) were treated for de novo acute myeloid leukaemia. Following a 
standard induction chemotherapy regimen comprising daunorubicin, cytosine arabinoside, and 
etoposide15 (DAV 3+7+5), patients received either Neupogen at 5 μg/kg/day or placebo, s.c., from 24 
hours after the last dose of chemotherapy until neutrophil recovery (ANC 1000/mm3 for 3 consecutive 
days or 10,000/mm3 for 1 day) or for a maximum of 35 days. In the Neupogen-treated group‚ the 
median time from initiation of chemotherapy to ANC recovery (ANC ≥ 500/mm3) was 20 days, the 
median duration of fever was reduced by 1.5 days (p = 0.009), and there were statistically significant 
reductions in the durations of i.v. antibiotic use and hospitalisation. During consolidation therapy (DAV 
2+5+5), patients treated with Neupogen  also experienced significant reductions in the incidence of 
severe neutropenia, time to neutrophil recovery, the incidence and duration of fever, and the durations 
of i.v. antibiotic use and hospitalization. Patients treated with a further course of standard (DAV 
2+5+5) or high-dose cytosine arabinoside consolidation also experienced significant reductions in the 
duration of neutropenia.  
The efficacy endpoint outcomes are markedly better than in the studies described in the Neupogen 
Prescribing information (PI). However, the differences in indications and chemotherapy regimens do 
not allow meaningful comparison. 
Study by Nabholz et al reports on metastatic breast cancer patients receiving TAC chemotherapy 
regimen, but without prophylactic G-CSF. All patients in that study experienced grade 3 or 4 
neutropenia. Neutropenia was observed in 98% of cycles and grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was observed 
in 95% of chemotherapy cycle. 
Studies by Green et al and Holmes et al evaluating Neupogen versus pegfilgrastim were selected as the 
reference studies due to the similarity in study treatments and endpoints. However, they enrolled 
patients who were overall older, with a more advanced disease but who received a chemotherapy 
regimen which is not as myelotoxic. KWI-300-104 study chemotherapy regimen additionally included 
cyclophosphamide - a chemotherapy component with high myelotoxicity score. Strong predictors of 
severe/febrile neutropenia include advanced age, performance status, myelosuppressive chemotherapy 
regimen, early low blood counts, the depth of the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) nadir, and a 
precipitous, early drop in blood counts of all hematopoietic cell types. Aggressive chemotherapy 
regimen has been identified as the major predictor of FN [odds ratio 5.2 (3.2–8.4)]. 
Efficacy outcomes are very similar to the reference studies by Green et al7 and Holmes et al. These 
studies were performed in the same indication and with similar filgrastim dosing regimen, albeit

somewhat different chemotherapy. However, baseline characteristics and differences in Protocol 
procedures do not allow direct comparison. 
Subgroup Analysis 
For all interactions, group means of duration of severe neutropenia (cycle 1) were computed and 
presented.  
According to the inferential analysis, there was no statistically significant difference among duration of 
severe neutropenia in the different age groups, no significant impact of weight on the duration of 
severe neutropenia (p=0.19) and TAC dose/BSA and absolute Neukine dose have no statistically 
significant impact on duration of severe neutropenia. However, depth of nadir, dose per body weight 
and onset day has statistically significant effect on the DSN, as expected.

The  most  frequently  reported  AE  was  bone  pain,  which  was  reported  267 
times by 80 (66.67%) patients. It was most frequently described as mild in 
105  (39.33%),  moderate  in  99  (37.08%)  and  severe  in  63  (23.60%) 
cases. 
Nine  patients  reported  10  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs).  All  10  SAEs 
(described by 14 event terms) reported during the treatment and follow-up 
periods were considered unrelated to Neukine.  
Two patients (1.67%) died during the follow-up period due to metastasis 
and disease progression. There were 99 severe AEs, 42 of which were 
considered not related, 5 possibly, 30 probably and 22 definitely related to 
Neukine. Among the 57 severe AEs considered possibly, probably and 
definitely related, there were 56 bone pain reports and 1 ISR. In addition, 
there was one life-threatening AE (not related). 
Analysis description  Secondary efficacy endpoints 
FN occurred in 3 (2.5%) patients in cycle 1 and did not occur in subsequent 
cycles. The mean ANC nadir of 0.37 x 109/l was recorded on mean (SD) 
day 7.20 (0.64). Post-nadir ANC >1.5 x 109/l, relative to chemotherapy 
administration, occurred after a median of 9 and mean (SD) 9.11 (1.32) 
days. Hospitalization during treatment and follow-up periods was necessary 
for 7 (5.83%), while i.v. antibiotic therapy was administered to 4 (3.33%) 
patients. Mobilization of CD34+ cells was demonstrated by rise to mean 
(SD) 110.67(101.18) x 106/l at cycle 1 day 9, over 4.57 (3.33) x 106/l at 
cycle 1 day 1. Duration of neutropenia in consecutive cycles (2-6) could not 
be measured reliably due to lower frequency of blood sampling.

In all head-to-head comparisons made, the 90% and 95% confidence interval for ANC Cmax included 
the 100% value except after s.c. administration of 75µg Apo-Filgrastim or Neupogen in the study KWI-
300-102 where it did not include the 100% value (90% CI 87.9- 96.2%). As the 90% and 95% 
confidence interval of ANC Cmax determined in the same study after s.c. administration of 150µg Apo-
Filgrastim or Neupogen included the 100% value (90% CI: 91.9-101.0, 95% CI: 91.02 – 101.93), the 
lack of inclusion of 100% for the 75µg dose is regarded as a study-specific observation, not indicating 
a true difference between the two drug products.  
As Apo-Filgrastim and Neupogen show bioequivalence for PK parameters and similar effects on ANC, it 
can be concluded that Apo-Filgrastim has equivalent efficacy to Neupogen.

No additional studies in the target population were submitted. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The Applicant performed a single-arm phase III study with the primary objective of evaluating the 
safety profile of Apo-filgrastim. Pharmacodynamic and efficacy endpoints were also evaluated. The 
Applicant compared the outcome data from this study to data from the literature – specifically to 
outcomes seen in similar cohorts administered G-CSF products or cohorts for which Grastofil would be 
indicated.  
Primary efficacy endpoint - The main efficacy endpoint was the duration of severe neutropenia (DSN) 
in cycle 1. The mean (SD) duration of severe neutropenia in cycle 1 was 1.40 (1.07) days. This was 
seen to be very similar to the filgrastim arms of the reference studies, where the corresponding values 
were 1.6 (1.1) and 1.8 (1.4) days, respectively. However, the reference studies used a somewhat 
different chemotherapy regimen which did not include cyclophosphamide. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints - Severe neutropenia in cycle 1 occurred in 77.50% of patients and 
febrile neutropenia occurred in 3 (2.5%) patients in cycle 1 and did not occur in subsequent cycles.  
Grastofil is restricted for use in adults only as there is currently no presentation compatible with safe 
dosing in children (see section 2.2.4). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The mean ANC nadir of 0.37 x 109/L was recorded on day 7.20 (0.64). Post-nadir ANC >1.5 x 109/l, 
relative to chemotherapy administration, occurred after a median of 9 and mean 9.11 days. 
Hospitalization was necessary for 7 (5.8%), while i.v. antibiotic therapy was administered to only 4 
(3.3%) patients. Mobilisation of CD34+ cells was demonstrated to rise to mean of 110.67 x 106/L at 
cycle 1 day 9, from 4.57 (3.33) x 106/L at cycle 1 day 1. Duration of neutropenia in consecutive cycles 
(2-6) was not reliably measured due to lower frequency of blood sampling. Data from repeat-dose 
studies of marketed G-CSF products in patients have occasionally shown there to be decreases in DSN 
and incidence of severe neutropenia with subsequent cycles of chemotherapy, especially between cycle 
1 and cycle 2. Whilst in study KWI-300-104 decreases were seen between cycle 1 and cycle 2, it was 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/303037/2013 
Page 67/89 
 
 
 
 
not clear whether these changes were due solely to reduced blood sampling in cycles 2-6. The clinical 
study report suggested that blood sampling before Day 9 in cycles 2-6 was not performed. It is unclear 
in this case how accurate estimation of ANC over time and consequently duration of severe 
neutropenia in those cycles was assured. This is considered a significant flaw in the study procedures. 
The comparison of data from these studies to those from the literature highlighted by the Applicant 
was complicated by differences in baseline disease characteristics and demographics, concomitant 
chemotherapy, region and clinical practice, such that comparison of these endpoints was not 
considered to be reliable. 
The rate of febrile neutropenia in KWI-300-104 study does not seem to be discordant to that obtained 
in the other studies. What is remarkable is that 29 patients had a nadir depth <0.08 109/L ANC lasting 
2.44 days, which means that a non-negligible number of patients were at very high risk of getting an 
infectious disease. Also, 77.50% of the patients had severe neutropenia despite all patients being 
naïve to chemotherapy and therefore having a more responsive bone marrow than patients previously 
treated with chemotherapy. Moreover, if the four patients who received intravenous antibiotic 
treatment (only one due to febrile neutropenia) were taken into consideration, the rate of febrile 
neutropenia would increase only slightly to 5% (6/120), which is still low considering the profound 
neutropenias experienced by study patients.  
The Applicant stated that body temperature was measured by the patients, and that the collection of 
data may not have been completely objective. Also, the slightly lower dose of doxorubicin could have 
had an impact on the rate of febrile neutropenia. Regardless of whether these justifications have merit, 
it should be remembered that the rate of febrile neutropenia is not a pivotal endpoint in the 
comparison of the G-CSF biosimilar to the reference product, provided that PK and PD biosimilarity is 
robustly shown. Therefore, undue significance should not be given to these uncertainties.  
Other endpoints evaluated include ECOG status, number of transfusions used to treat 
thrombocytopenia and anaemia, chemotherapy dose delivered, chemotherapy cycle delay and 
occurrence and/or resolution of chemotherapy-induced mucositis. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Given the issues which arose during the procedure regarding demonstration of pharmacodynamic 
comparability of Grastofil and Neupogen in the PK/PD studies, a comparative randomised trial in 
patients would have provided data to adequately support the comparability of the two agents, 
especially in case sensitive PD endpoints were pursued as well. However, as noted above, in the G-CSF 
biosimilar clinical comparability exercise, the endpoints of DSN and FN are not considered pivotal and 
are measures of lesser sensitivity by which clinical comparability may be demonstrated. Overall, the 
efficacy data from study KWI-300-104 were not considered to provide significant support to the pivotal 
PD data from the phase I studies.

Cancer patients safety population 
A total of 120 women were enrolled into study KWI-300-104. There were six cycles of chemotherapy, 
each cycle 3 weeks apart for a total of 18 weeks. Treatment with Apo-Filgrastim began on day 2 of 
every chemotherapy cycle and was continued up to 14 days or until post-nadir recovery of the absolute 
neutrophil count, whichever occurred first. Apo-Filgrastim was self-administered. Study patients 
received 300 μg (if body weight was 40-75 kg) or 480 μg (if body weight was 76-120 kg) of Apo-
Filgrastim daily for a maximum of six cycles of chemotherapy. 113 patients (94.17%) completed the 
treatment period and 109 patients (90.83%) completed the safety follow-up period up to week 48. 
Patient withdrawal is summarised in the following table:

Healthy volunteers safety population 
Studies KWI-300-101 and KWI-300-012 were single-dose studies. Healthy volunteers received a single 
dose of Apo-Filgrastim and Neupogen on two occasions separated by a washout period. Study KWI-
300-103 was a repeat dose study in which healthly volunteers were exposed to a daily administration 
of the study drug on 4 consecutive days.  
In total, 144 subjects were exposed to Apo-Filgrastim and Neupogen (reference medicinal product) and 
6 subjects received placebo. Apo-Filgrastim and Neupogen were administered either by (i) the 
subcutaneous route in fixed doses of 75 µg and 150 µg respectively or by (ii) the intravenous route at 
5µg/kg body weight. Overall, 3 subjects did not complete the study: 2 subjects owing to voluntary 
withdrawal and 1 subject because of pregnancy. Subject withdrawal is summarised in the following

Adverse events  
Cancer patients safety population 
In study KWI-300-104, 110 out of 120 breast cancer patients (91.6%) reported 1216 treatment-
emergent adverse events. Most treatment-emergent adverse events were assessed as not related to 
study medication. Results are summarised in the following tables:

Table 66: Summary of treatment emergent adverse events in study KWI-300-104 according 
to SOC > 5% (Cancer patients safety population) 
The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were: 
• 
• 
nausea observed with 278 events (22.86%) in 64 patients (53.33%) 
bone pain with 267 events (21.96%) in 80 patients (66.67%). 
The most common treatment-emergent adverse event that was possibly related to the study 
medication was bone pain in 70 patients (58.33%). The mean (SD) duration of bone pain was 9.78 
(13.28) days among the patients who reported bone pain. Bone pain was most described as mild in 
105 (39.33%) cases. Pain was described as severe in 63 (23.60%) cases, moderate in 99 (37.08%) 
cases and mild in 105 (39.3%) of cases. The incidence and severity of bone pain were highest in the 
first cycle with 62 (51.67%) patients reporting bone pain, of which 20 patients (16.67%) reported 
severe bone pain. Bone pain did not result in any discontinuations. 
All other possibly drug related treatment-emergent adverse events were mild or moderate and were 
observed in less than 5% of study patients. All possibly drug related treatment-emergent adverse 
events resolved. Injection site reactions were observed in 4 (3.33%) patients, two of which (1.67%) 
reported injection site pain in addition. One other patient (0.83%) reported pruritus at the injection

site. All reactions were mild except for one moderate swelling, one case of severe warmth, and one 
event that required analgesia.  
Results are summarised in the following table: 
Table 67: Summary of possibly related treatment emergent adverse events in study KWI-
300-104 according to SOC (Cancer patients safety population) 
Healthy volunteers safety population 
Back pain (21.53% of subjects in Apo-Filgrastim and Neupogen groups) was the most commonly 
observed possibly related treatment-emergent adverse events. The incidence of other possibly related 
treatment-emergent adverse events including fatigue, arthralgia, feeling hot, neck pain, dyspnoea, and 
pyrexia occurred in between 1 and 5 patients out of 144. The numbers of events were similar between 
Apo-Filgrastim and Neupogen groups.  
Bone pain (considered to be present if the preferred terms arthralgia, back pain, bone pain, neck pain 
or pain in extremity were reported) was considered to be possibly-related to study drug in a similar 
percentage of subjects who received Apo-Filgrastim and Neupogen (24.31% and 22.92% respectively). 
Two subjects experienced allergic reactions which were considered to be possibly related to study Apo-
Filgrastim in one subject. The symptom was pruritic rash occurring on 3 occasions. 
One event of injection site erythema, two events of headache and two events of back pain were 
considered to be severe and related to study medication. All were resolved. 
Other adverse events were considered to be mild or moderate.

Laboratory findings 
Cancer patients safety population 
Blood samples were taken at screening, day 0 of chemotherapy cycle 1, day 7 of chemotherapy cycle 
1, day 0 of cycle 4, week 20 and week 24. Day 0 was within 72 hours before administration of 
chemotherapy. 
Liver enzymes 
From study start up to the beginning of chemotherapy cycle 4, the mean serum Aspartate 
transaminase (AST) activity remained stable when assessed. During the follow-up period after the end 
of treatment with Apo-Filgrastim, the AST values slightly increased to values of 0.49 μkat/L (week 20) 
and 0.45 μkat/L (week 24).  
Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) activities remained stable 
over the course of the study up to the beginning of chemotherapy cycle 4 with increases on Day 7 of 
cycle 1 (ALT mean change from baseline 0.18 µkat/L, GGT mean change from baseline 0.21 (µkat/L)) . 
Mean Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity remained stable over time. Mean lactate dehydrogenase 
(LDH) activity remained low in cycle 1 and then slightly increased in cycle 4 and during the follow-up of 
the study. 
Urate 
Serum urate concentrations during the course of the study are shown in the following table: 
Table 69: Uric acid values and change from baseline (µmol/L) in study KWI-300-104 
(Cancer patients safety population) 
Haematology 
Platelet counts decreased on Day 7 of cycle 1 compared to baseline (172.91 x 109/L versus 276.23 x 
109/L). On Day 0 of cycle 4, platelet value was 344.25 x 109/L which was above the baseline value, 
indicating a transient decrease during chemotherapy cycles, as shown in the following table:

Haemoglobin values decreased after start of chemotherapy. During the follow-up period after the end 
of treatment with Apo-Filgrastim, the haemoglobin showed a trend towards return to baseline, as 
shown in the following table: 
Table 71: Haemoglogin values and change from baseline (mmol/L) in study KWI-300-104 
(Cancer patients safety population) 
Healthy volunteers safety population 
In studies KWI-300-101 and KWI-300-012 (single-dose studies), safety laboratory blood samples were 
taken at baseline, after 24 hours and after 72 hours. In study KWI-300-103, which was a repeat dose 
study, safety laboratory blood samples were taken at baseline, after 48 hours and after 96 hours. All 
three studies in healthy volunteers were performed at the same clinical site. The final healthy 
volunteer study, GCSF-SUIN-05SB01-3FA-(5) was conducted at a different site, with blood sampling 
performed at multiple intervals until 96 hours after administration of the test dose. There were not any 
statistically significant differences in measurements of ALT, ALP, LDH, urate, CRP, d-Dimer or aPTT 
between the Apo-Filgrastim and Neupogen arms of the above studies and at the times chosen. 
Safety in special populations 
No safety studies in special populations were submitted. 
Immunological events 
Antibodies to filgrastim were determined in a three-step antibody assay: (i) Screening assay, (ii) 
Confirmatory assay and (iii) Neutralising assay. Immunogenicity assessment was performed in study 
KWI-300-104 at (a) the time of patient screening (baseline value), (b) Day 0 of Cycle 2-6 and (c) in 
the safety follow-up in Week 20, 24, 36 and 48.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/303037/2013 
Page 77/89 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Antibodies were detected only in the screening antibody assay in 4 patients. None of the patients had 
persistent presence of antibodies throughout the study. None of the samples were confirmed as 
positive in the confirmatory assay. The neutralisation assay was therefore not performed as no positive 
samples were detected.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Data on the influence of extrinsic factors such as smoking and diet have not been provided. Drug-drug 
interactions have not been studied. There are no data on overdose or drug abuse potential. There are 
no data on the effects of the current product on the ability to drive or operate machinery.  There are 
no data on the effects of the current product on mental activity. 
Rebound effects of Apo-Filgrastim were not observed. In cancer patients, absolute neutrophil counts 
had returned to baseline by the beginning of each subsequent chemotherapy cycle.  In healthy 
subjects, absolute neutrophil counts had returned to baseline by day 4.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
One subject withdrew from study KWI-300-104 because of a non-serious duodenal ulcer. The 
withdrawal was not considered to be related to study medication. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
One hundred and forty four healthy subjects were exposed to either Apo-filgrastim or Neupogen 
(originator) in the initial three phase 1 studies. A further 48 healthy volunteers were exposed to 
Grastofil and Neupogen in the later completed phase I study, GCSF-SUIN-05SB01-3FA. However, 
safety data in healthy individuals is only considered supportive, with safety data from clinical trial 
patients being the main focus of the safety evaluation of G-CSF biosimilar products.  
One hundred and thirteen female patients with breast cancer were exposed to Apo-filgrastim over 6 
cycles of chemotherapy with follow-up data to 48 weeks for 109 patients in one phase 3 non-
comparator clinical study.  
The information collected on neutropenia cases and febrile neutropenia comes from two different 
sources: one the efficacy data and the other the standard adverse event reported in the CRF. Three 
cases of serious neutropenia were reported, all during cycle 1 and one was a febrile neutropenia. The 
information provided however, does not appear to match the data provided in the efficacy part of the 
dossier. It is noted that for cycles 2-6 this information was collected at day 9 (after the day 7 when 
neutropenia occur most often) when most patients are likely to have recovered i.e. the number of 
cases are likely to have been under-estimated by the applicant. 
The efficacy results show that 93/120 (77%) of the patients had severe neutropenia, mainly starting at 
day seven and with a duration of 1 day (39%) or 2 days (38%). However, the data from the standard 
adverse event report are not in line with these percentage as 6 neutropenia events occurred in cycle 1 
(4 cases were severe neutropenia) and the duration was longer (4-5 days) in most of the cases. These 
differences are likely to be due to differences in reporting of FN events as AEs by the investigators but 
could also be seen as a lack of standardization in the collection of safety events. As the main objective 
of the study KWI-300-104 was to assess the safety of Apo-filgrastim, the Applicant should have made 
an effort to establish a standardized protocol of safety data collection. Discrepancies in neutropenia 
cases are disappointing and highlight the weakness of the methodology and possibly training of study 
site staff. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/303037/2013 
Page 78/89 
 
 
 
The adverse events reported for the current product and the originator for the most part (see 
musculoskeletal AEs and serum liver enzyme result discussion below) appear similar though the 
numbers of subjects studied and incidence of adverse events (except for bone pain) are too small to 
allow meaningful comparison with historical data for the originator.  
The Applicant could not confirm similarity of changes in serum liver enzyme measures in the dossier, 
due in part to the lack of a comparative clinical trial in patients. It could also be that the timing of 
blood samples and the manner in which results were displayed resulted in a laboratory profile that was 
noticeably dissimilar to the originator. There was then some residual concern that the apparent 
differences between originator and the current product were not entirely supportive of claims of 
similarity of safety profile between Apo-Filgrastim and the originator product.  However, assurance was 
provided as the lab changes in question are well known to be associated with G-CSF therapies and are 
not unexpected and not classed as serious. It is not unlikely that the inherent variability of data from a 
relatively small patient sample may have led to the appearance of dissimilarity with regard to 
laboratory results between Grastofil and Neupogen. This issue can be appropriately and further 
evaluated through routine pharmacovigilance measures post-approval; including reviews in the PSUR 
and reporting & discussion of reports of raised liver function tests (LFTs) (ALP, AST, ALT, gamma GT, 
SGOT, SGPT, bilirubin). 
The rate of musculoskeletal pain was seen to be appreciably higher in the Apo-filgrastim study in 
patients (66.7%) than in studies the literature where Neupogen was administered to patients with 
similar disease characteristics and demographics (Holmes et al 26%; Green et al 42%). The Applicant 
states that the differences between Apo-filgrastim and Neupogen in the percentages of musculoskeletal 
AE disorders, mainly bone pain, are due to the method of data collection for this AE (specifically 
documented in the CRF on a specific Bone Pain Assessment Module, in addition to the standard 
documentation on the Adverse Event page). Although, this is seen as a potential explanation the 
protocol should have been designed to allow a proper comparability exercise.  
Whilst a comparative trial in patients would have been preferred, it is nonetheless considered that the 
Applicant has complied with advice in “Guidance on similar medicinal products containing recombinant 
granulocyte-colony stimulating factor”, EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/31329/2005, February 2006 which states: 
“Safety data should be collected from a cohort of patients after repeated dosing preferably in a 
comparative clinical trial. The total exposure should correspond to the exposure of a conventional 
chemotherapeutic treatment course with several cycles. The total follow up of patients should be at 
least 6 months”. 
However, “Guidance on similar medicinal products containing recombinant granulocyte-colony 
stimulating factor”, EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/31329/2005, February 2006 goes on to state that: 
 “The number of patients should be sufficient for the evaluation of the adverse effect profile, including 
bone pain and laboratory abnormalities”. 
There is concern that the clinical study only included 120 patients (11 of whom withdrew from the 
study) and that this number of participants might not be adequate to fully evaluate the adverse effect 
profile. However, safety data are supplemented by data from four phase I studies in healthy 
volunteers. Furthermore, considering the biosimilarity with regard to physicochemical characteristics 
and functions of the molecule as well as the sufficiently similar PK and PD profiles, AEs related to 
exaggerated PD effects can be expected at similar frequencies for the test and reference product.  
A robust post-marketing surveillance programme has been agreed with the Applicant including reviews 
in the PSUR, reporting & discussion of all important, identified and reported risks and reviews of 
serious and long-term adverse events from registries. These measures are detailed in the risk 
Assessment report

Page 79/89 
 
 
 
management plan (RMP). This provides adequate reassurance that further evaluation of safety 
comparability will be undertaken and routinely revisited.    
It is uncertain that the immunogenicity studies done during the phase III clinical studies are adequate 
to fully characterise the immunogenicity of the current product. It is considered that the Applicant 
should undertake additional pharmacovigilance activities with regard to evaluating the immunogenicity 
of Grastofil in clinical practice. The activities are detailed in the RMP.  
Grastofil is restricted for use in adults only as there is currently no presentation compatible with safe 
dosing in children (see section 2.2.4).  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The CHMP considers that the overall safety profile of the product is acceptable. Immunogenicity is a 
rare adverse event which requires the implementation of long-term minimisation measures. The 
Applicant will undertake additional pharmacovigilance activities post-authorisation including reporting 
and discussion of all identified and potential risks, and reviews of serious and long-term adverse 
events from registries. From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials 
have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. There are no new adverse reactions 
observed with Grastofil which are different from what has been described with Neupogen. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The applicant has provided documents that set out a detailed description of the system of 
pharmacovigilance, V7 dated 17 May 2010. A statement signed by the Applicant  and the qualified 
person for pharmacovigilance, indicating that the Applicant has the services of a qualified person 
responsible for pharmacovigilance and the necessary means for the notification of any adverse reaction 
occurring either in the Community or in a third country has been provided. The Applicant addressed all 
concerns presented and has submitted a summary of the PSMF which has been dated and versioned. 
The PSMF is located where the QPPV operates, in The Netherlands, and the EV-code is MFL 1614. 
The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the 
legislative requirements. The Applicant must ensure that the system of pharmacovigilance is in place 
and functioning before the product is placed on the market. 
2.8.  Risk Management Plan

Section 1.3.1 Grastofil SmPC, section 4.4 it is 
mentioned that pulmonary adverse effects, in 
particular interstitial pneumonia, have been 
reported after G-CSF administration. Patients 
with a recent history of lung infiltrates or 
pneumonia may be at higher risk. The onset 
of pulmonary signs, such as cough, fever and 
dyspnoea in association with radiological 
signs of pulmonary infiltrates and 
deterioration in pulmonary function may be 
preliminary signs of acute respiratory distress 
syndrome (ARDS). Grastofil should be 
discontinued and appropriate treatment 
given. 
In addition, section 4.8 mentions that 
pulmonary adverse effects including 
interstitial pneumonia, pulmonary oedema, 
and lung infiltration have been reported in 
some cases with an outcome of respiratory 
failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome 
(ARDS), which may be fatal.

  In Section 1.3.1 Grastofil SmPC, section 4.4, 
it is mentioned that transient cytogenetic 
modifications have been observed in normal 
donors following G-CSF use. The significance 
of these changes in terms of the development 
of haematological malignancy is unknown. 
Long-term safety follow-up of donors is 
ongoing. A risk of promotion of a malignant 
myeloid clone cannot be excluded. It is 
recommended that the aphaeresis centre 
perform a systematic record and tracking of 
the stem cell donors for at least 10 years to 
ensure monitoring of long-term safety  
No additional risk minimisation steps are

unclear whether long-term treatment of 
patients with SCN will predispose patients to 
cytogenetic abnormalities, MDS or leukaemic 
transformation. It is recommended to perform 
morphologic and cytogenetic bone marrow 
examinations in patients at regular intervals

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The pharmacokinetics of Apo-filgrastim were investigated in four studies in healthy human subjects – a 
single 5µg/kg intravenous dose study, a 75µg and 150µg single subcutaneous dose study, a 300 µg 
single subcutaneous dose study and a repeat subcutaneous dose 5µg/kg/day study.   
PK data were analysed using ANOVA on log-transformed data with terms for sequence, subject within 
sequence, period and treatment. This is the analysis requested in the CHMP bioequivalence guideline. 
The acceptance limits set for the confidence intervals of the ratios were in line with those outlined in 
the CHMP bioequivalence guideline. 
Data for the PK parameters AUC0-24, AUC0-inf, CMAX for all 4 PK/PD studies showed the confidence 
intervals for ratios to be contained within 80-125% regardless of analysis population (PP, ITT, 
sensitivity). Any concerns in study KWI-300-101 that AUC0-32 rather than AUC0-inf was primarily used 
for the comparability exercise can be rested as there was shown to be <1% difference between the 
two AUC parameters, with  confidence intervals for the ratios of both falling within the acceptance 
limits. 90% confidence intervals for the PK data from the 300 µg single subcutaneous dose study, 
GCSF-SUIN-05SB01-3FA-(5), were also comfortably contained within the 80-125% acceptance margin. 
This study was used to demonstrate PK & PD similarity of the Grastofil product intended for 
commercialisation (process III) to Neupogen, as it was noted that some changes in manufacturing 
process proposed for the product originally used in the clinical trials (process II) could cause 
alterations in the product.   
The data presented by the Applicant for PD outcomes suggested that similarity between test and 
reference products, with regard to PD outcomes, has been demonstrated, as 90% CIs and the 95% CI 
for the differences fell within the Applicant’s pre-specified acceptance margins of 80-125%.  
Clinical data from the target population appeared to confirm that PD, haematological and infective 
outcomes in advanced breast cancer patients administered Apo-filgrastim in combination with 
Assessment report

Page 84/89 
 
 
 
 
myelosuppressive chemotherapy were similar to those seen in similar population administered 
Neupogen or other G-CSF products.   
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Statistically significant PK differences between the products were seen in studies KWI-300-101 and 
GCSF-SUIN-05SB01-3FA. These 'bioassays' constituted evidence that real differences between test and 
reference formulations existed that may, in principle, have presented a concern for conclusion of 
biosimilarity. Although for all key PK parameters, the 90% confidence intervals of the ratios of the 
means were fully contained within the 80-125% acceptance limits, in line with the guidance provided in 
the CHMP Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence, the significant differences needed to be 
addressed. The low variability of the PK data as a result of enrolling more subjects than required in the 
above studies was thought to only partly explain the significant differences. Ultimately, the reasons for 
these differences were not definitively identified. However, it was noted that for the majority of PK 
outcomes in the dossier the trend was for differences between test and reference products to be 
smaller and not statistically significant. Further, the differences did not lead to clinically or statistically 
significant differences in PD outcomes, strongly suggesting that clinically, the differences were not 
meaningful and would not lead to differences in clinical effect.  
For the first three studies in healthy volunteers the majority of PK estimates for Apo-filgrastim (process 
II product) were lower than those of the reference product (significantly so, as already noted for study 
KWI-300-101); although for the single dose study using process III commercial product (GCSF-SUIN-
05SB01-3FA), the estimates were statistically significantly higher. There was suggestion therefore that 
products of the two processes may not have been bioequivalent to each other, creating concern that 
efficacy and safety data from trial KWI-300-104, could not be extrapolated to process III product. 
However, the CHMP considered that there were a number of factors that would significantly undermine 
such claims; not least the modest differences between test-reference PK and PD ratios for process II 
and III products, the inherent limitations of interpreting data from across studies and most significantly 
the confidence intervals of the ratios falling fully within the agreed acceptance limits. Importantly, the 
clinical comparability exercise is underpinned by Quality and non-clinical comparability exercises which 
sufficiently demonstrated that Apo-Filgrastim drug substance and drug product from the clinical stages 
of process development and from the proposed commercial process were comparable with one another 
and to the reference product, Neupogen. Given the positive PK/PD data from study GCSF-SUIN-
05SB01-3FA (process III product) and supportive data from the Quality and non-clinical comparability 
exercises the CHMP was assured of comparability of process II and process III products. 
As regards pharmacodynamics, the 80-125% acceptance margin used for the initial PD comparability 
exercise during the MAA procedure was considered too wide for demonstration of PD similarity 
especially for the Grastofil package where comparative clinical efficacy and safety data from patients 
were not available.  A tighter acceptance limit of +/- 10% was agreed. However, a number of 
confidence intervals of PD outcome ratios did not fall entirely within these limits, especially in the 
repeated-dose and low dose settings. Reassuringly, despite the studies not being powered such that 
95% confidence intervals of the PD ratios would be contained within the narrow limits, for three of the 
five dosing regimens evaluated this was the case, strongly supporting PD similarity of the products. For 
the remaining regimens, the excursions past the lower bound of the narrower acceptance limits were 
small, as were the actual mean differences between the products. Given that the more stringent limits 
were applied retrospectively and were not factored into the initial sample size calculations for the 
PK/PD studies, it is not inconceivable that a small number of confidence intervals may fail to fall within 
the more stringent boundary as the studies would have been underpowered. In this case, the adoption 
of a more flexible approach with regard to the recommended width of the acceptance limit for the CIs 
of PD ratios was accepted by the CHMP. Further, it was shown by the Applicant that the doses of 1-
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/303037/2013 
Page 85/89 
 
 
 
5µg/kg sit on the steep part of the dose response curve and that the single-dose studies, based on 
data in the dossier, are equally as sensitive as the repeated-dose study in detecting PD differences 
between the test and the reference products. Therefore, given the overall data it can be concluded that 
PD similarity has been demonstrated between Grastofil and Neupogen and that the differences seen in 
the repeated-dose study are unlikely to have consequences in clinical practice.  
The supportive CD34+ PD data in the dossier are weak due to the inadequate blood sampling schedule 
and the poor collection of data. Although robust data from statistical evaluation of comparability of 
response could not be provided, data from studies KWI-300-103 and KWI-300-104 demonstrated that 
the CD34+ responses to Apo-filgrastim and Neupogen were alike. Therefore, based on current 
knowledge of G-CSF, biosimilar filgrastims and G-CSF analogue activity at the G-CSF receptor, given 
that test-to-reference comparability has been determined in quality, non-clinical and clinical 
comparability exercises, the CHMP does not expect CD34+ response to Grastofil and Neupogen to 
differ in a clinically significant manner.    
The lack of robust controlled safety and efficacy data from patients requires that PK and PD similarity 
in healthy volunteer studies be robustly demonstrated. Overall, given the totality of the data available 
within the clinical development programme, it is considered that the PK and PD similarity of Grastofil 
and Neupogen has been demonstrated. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Safety data has been accrued from one phase III non-comparative, repeat-dose study over 6 cycles of 
chemotherapy in 120 female patients with breast cancer. Bone pain is a known adverse event 
associated with the originator. For the current product, bone pain was recorded in 66.7% of patients. 
The bone pain lasted about 10 days and was described as severe in approximately 24% cases, 
moderate in 37% cases and mild in 39% of cases. The incidence and severity of bone pain were 
highest in the first cycle of chemotherapy. Other events, including injection site reactions, were 
recorded in less than 5% patients and were either mild or moderate; they all resolved. There were 
some fluctuations in the serum activities of liver-derived enzymes such as AST, ALT, ALP, gamma-GT 
and in the serum activity of LDH and the serum concentration of urate in response to exposure to the 
current product.  
Safety data has also been accrued from four phase 1 single dose studies in a total of 230 healthy 
volunteers. Bone pain occurred in approximately 23% subjects in both Apo-Filgrastim and originator 
arms of the three initial phase I studies. Overall, the adverse events reported for the current product 
and the originator appeared similar in type and frequency though the numbers of subjects studied are 
too small to be definite. There were not any deaths in the studies submitted. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
There is concern that the number of healthy volunteers who took part in the submitted studies is too 
small and the exposure to the current product too short to adequately characterise the safety profile of 
the current product. The non-comparative nature of the phase III study also hinders comparison to the 
originator. However, the concern is not significant as safety data in healthy individuals is only 
considered supportive, with safety data from clinical trial patients being the main focus of the safety 
evaluation of G-CSF biosimilar products. The safety profile of Apo-filgrastim in the pivotal study was as 
expected for a filgrastim, acknowledging some limitations in the size of the safety database. 
Furthermore, considering the biosimilarity with regard to physicochemical characteristics and functions 
of the molecule as well as the sufficiently similar PK and PD profiles between Apo-filgrastim and the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/303037/2013 
Page 86/89 
 
 
 
reference medicinal product, AEs related to exaggerated PD effects can be expected at similar 
frequencies for the two products.  
A robust post-marketing surveillance programme has been agreed with the Applicant including reviews 
in the PSUR, reporting & discussion of all important, identified and reported risks and reviews of 
serious and long-term adverse events from the registries. These measures are detailed in the RMP.  
Exposure to the originator is known to result in marked changes in the serum activities of liver-derived 
serum enzymes in subgroups of patients. The applicant has not confirmed such changes to the same 
extent in blood test results taken whilst patients were exposed to the current product and certainly not 
in the context of a comparative clinical study. It may be that the timing of blood samples and the 
manner in which results were displayed have resulted in a laboratory profile that is noticeably 
dissimilar to the originator. There is then some residual concern that the apparent differences between 
originator and the current product may not be entirely supportive of claims of similarity of safety 
profile between Apo-Filgrastim and the originator product. However, some assurance is provided as the 
lab changes in question are well known to be associated with G-CSF therapies and are not unexpected 
and not classed as serious. It is not unlikely that the inherent variability of data from a relatively small 
patient sample may have led to the appearance of dissimilarity with regard to laboratory results 
between Grastofil and Neupogen at certain times during the study. This issue can be appropriately and 
further evaluated through routine pharmacovigilance measures post-approval; including reviews in the 
PSUR and reporting & discussion of reports of raised liver function tests (LFTs) (ALP, AST, ALT, gamma 
GT, SGOT, SGPT, bilirubin).  
Whilst the apparent absence of antibody development to the current product would be consistent with 
the originator, there is concern that the number of patients was too small to adequately characterise 
its immunogenicity. It is considered necessary for the Applicant to undertake additional 
pharmacovigilance activities with regard to evaluating the immunogenicity of Grastofil in clinical 
practice. These activities are detailed in the RMP. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The benefit/risk balance of Grastofil is considered positive, as a benefit/risk ratio comparable to the 
reference product can be concluded. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
PK similarity between Apo-filgrastim/ Grastofil and Neupogen at and around the main clinical dose 
(5µg/kg) has been convincingly demonstrated. The totality of the PD data from the development 
programme supports the PD similarity of the test and reference products. Although the clinical efficacy 
and safety data submitted were from a single uncontrolled clinical study, it should be noted that in a 
G-CSF biosimilar MAA, robust PD data in healthy volunteers could be considered pivotal, as in this 
case. 
Overall, the demonstration of biosimilarity should be based on the results of robust quality (analytical 
structure, potency assays, purity), non-clinical (receptor binding, toxicokinetic studies) and clinical (PK, 
PD, safety and efficacy) comparability exercises. The totality of the data provided from the quality, 
non-clinical and clinical comparability exercises support demonstration of biosimilarity of Grastofil to 
Neupogen.

4. Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Grastofil in the in the following indication: 
•  Grastofil is indicated for the reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of 
febrile neutropenia in adult patients treated with established cytotoxic chemotherapy for 
malignancy (with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes) 
and for the reduction in the duration of neutropenia in adult patients undergoing myeloablative 
therapy followed by bone marrow transplantation considered to be at increased risk of 
prolonged severe neutropenia.  
•  Grastofil is indicated for the mobilisation of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) in adults. 
• 
In adult patients with severe congenital, cyclic, or idiopathic neutropenia with an absolute 
neutrophil count (ANC) of ≤ 0.5 x 109/L, and a history of severe or recurrent infections, long 
term administration of Grastofil is indicated to increase neutrophil counts and to reduce the 
incidence and duration of infection-related events. 
•  Grastofil is indicated for the treatment of persistent neutropenia (ANC less than or equal to 1.0 
x 109/L) in adults with advanced HIV infection, in order to reduce the risk of bacterial 
infections when other options to manage neutropenia are inappropriate.  
is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the

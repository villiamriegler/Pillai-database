CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Anagrelide is indicated for the reduction of elevated platelet counts in at risk essential 
thrombocythaemia (ET) patients who are intolerant to their current therapy or whose elevated platelet 
counts are not reduced to an acceptable level by their current therapy. 
An at-risk patient 
An at-risk ET patient is defined by one or more of the following features: 
• 
• 
• 
> 60 years of age or 
a platelet count >1,000 x 109/l or 
a history of thrombo-haemorrhagic events.  
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Treatment with anagrelide should be initiated by a clinician with experience in the management of ET. 
Posology 
The recommended starting dose of anagrelide is 1 mg/day, which should be administered orally in two 
divided doses (0.5 mg/dose). 
The starting dose should be maintained for at least one week. After one week the dose may be titrated, 
on an individual basis, to achieve the lowest effective dose required to reduce and/or maintain a 
platelet count below 600 x 109/l and ideally at levels between 150 x 109/l and 400 x 109/l. The dose 
increment must not exceed more than 0.5 mg/day in any one week and the recommended maximum 
single dose should not exceed 2.5 mg (see section 4.9). During clinical development doses of 
10 mg/day have been used. 
The effects of treatment with anagrelide must be monitored on a regular basis (see section 4.4). If the 
starting dose is > 1 mg/day, platelet counts should be performed every two days during the first week 
of treatment and at least weekly thereafter until a stable maintenance dose is reached. Typically, a fall 
in the platelet count will be observed within 14 to 21 days of starting treatment and in most patients an 
adequate therapeutic response will be observed and maintained at a dose of 1 to 3 mg/day (for further 
information on the clinical effects, refer to section 5.1). 
Special populations 
Elderly 
The observed pharmacokinetic differences between elderly and young patients with ET (see section 
5.2) do not warrant using a different starting regimen or different dose titration step to achieve an 
individual patient-optimised anagrelide regimen. 
During clinical development, approximately 50% of the patients treated with anagrelide were over 
60 years of age and no age specific alterations in dose were required in these patients. However, as 
expected, patients in this age group had twice the incidence of serious adverse reactions (mainly 
cardiac). 
Renal impairment 
There are limited pharmacokinetic data for this patient population. The potential risks and benefits of 
anagrelide therapy in a patient with impairment of renal function should be assessed before treatment 
is commenced (see section 4.3). 
Hepatic impairment 
There are limited pharmacokinetic data for this patient population. However, hepatic metabolism 
represents the major route of anagrelide clearance and liver function may therefore be expected to 
influence this process. Therefore, it is recommended that patients with moderate or severe hepatic 
impairment are not treated with anagrelide. The potential risks and benefits of anagrelide therapy in a 
patient with mild impairment of hepatic function should be assessed before treatment is commenced 
(see sections 4.3 and 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of anagrelide in children have not been established. The experience in children 
and adolescents is very limited; anagrelide should be used in this patient group with caution. In the 
absence of specific paediatric guidelines, WHO diagnostic criteria for adult diagnosis of ET are 
considered to be of relevance to the paediatric population. Diagnostic guidelines for ET should be 
followed carefully and diagnosis reassessed periodically in cases of uncertainty, with effort made to 
distinguish from hereditary or secondary thrombocytosis, which may include genetic analysis and 
bone marrow biopsy. 
Typically, cytoreductive therapy is considered in high-risk paediatric patients. 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Anagrelide treatment should only be initiated when the patient shows signs of disease progression or 
suffers from thrombosis. If treatment is initiated, the benefits and risks of treatment with anagrelide 
must be monitored regularly and the need for ongoing treatment evaluated periodically. 
Platelet targets are assigned on an individual patient basis by the treating physician. 
Discontinuation of treatment should be considered in paediatric patients who do not have a satisfactory 
treatment response after approximately 3 months (see section 4.4). 
Currently available data are described in sections 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2, but no recommendation on a 
posology can be made. 
Method of administration 
Anagrelide Viatris is for oral use. The capsules must be swallowed whole. The contents of the 
capsules should not be crushed or diluted in a liquid. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. 
Patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <50 ml/min). 
4.4 
Special warnings and precautions for use 
Hepatic impairment 
The potential risks and benefits of anagrelide therapy in a patient with mild impairment of hepatic 
function should be assessed before treatment is commenced. It is not recommended in patients with 
elevated transaminases (>5 times the upper limit of normal) (see sections 4.2 and 4.3). 
Renal impairment 
The potential risks and benefits of anagrelide therapy in a patient with impairment of renal function 
should be assessed before treatment is commenced (see sections 4.2 and 4.3). 
Thrombotic risk 
Abrupt treatment discontinuation should be avoided due to the risk of sudden increase in platelet 
counts, which may lead to potentially fatal thrombotic complications, such as cerebral infarction. 
Patients should be advised how to recognize early signs and symptoms suggestive of thrombotic 
complications, such as cerebral infarction, and if symptoms occur to seek medical assistance.   
Treatment discontinuation 
In the event of dosage interruption or treatment withdrawal, the rebound in platelet count is variable, 
but the platelet count will start to increase within 4 days of stopping treatment with anagrelide and will 
return to pre-treatment levels within 10 to 14 days, possibly rebounding above baseline values. 
Therefore, platelets should be monitored frequently (see section 4.2). 
Monitoring 
Therapy requires close clinical supervision of the patient which will include a full blood count 
(haemoglobin and white blood cell and platelet counts), assessment of liver function (ALT and AST), 
renal function (serum creatinine and urea) and electrolytes (potassium, magnesium and calcium).

Cardiovascular 
Serious cardiovascular adverse reactions including cases of torsade de pointes, ventricular tachycardia, 
cardiomyopathy, cardiomegaly and congestive heart failure have been reported (see section 4.8). 
Caution should be taken when using anagrelide in patients with known risk factors for prolongation of 
the QT interval, such as congenital long QT syndrome, a known history of acquired QTc prolongation, 
medicinal products that can prolong QTc interval and hypokalaemia. 
Care should also be taken in populations that may have a higher maximum plasma concentration 
(Cmax) of anagrelide or its active metabolite, 3-hydroxy anagrelide, e.g., hepatic impairment or use 
with CYP1A2 inhibitors (see section 4.5). 
Close monitoring for an effect on the QTc interval is advisable. 
A pre-treatment cardiovascular examination, including a baseline ECG and echocardiography is 
recommended for all patients prior to initiating therapy with anagrelide. All patients should be 
monitored regularly during treatment (e.g., ECG or echocardiography) for evidence of cardiovascular 
effects that may require further cardiovascular examination and investigation. Hypokalaemia or 
hypomagnesaemia must be corrected prior to anagrelide administration and should be monitored 
periodically during therapy. 
Anagrelide is an inhibitor of cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase III and because of its positive inotropic 
and chronotropic effects, anagrelide should be used with caution in patients of any age with known or 
suspected heart disease. Moreover, serious cardiovascular adverse reactions have also occurred in 
patients without suspected heart disease and with normal pre-treatment cardiovascular examination. 
Anagrelide should only be used if the potential benefits of therapy outweigh the potential risks. 
Pulmonary hypertension  
Cases of pulmonary hypertension have been reported in patients treated with anagrelide. Patients 
should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of underlying cardiopulmonary disease prior to initiating 
and during anagrelide therapy.    
Paediatric population 
Very limited data are available on the use of anagrelide in the paediatric population and anagrelide 
should be used in this patient group with caution (see sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). 
As with the adult population, a full blood count and assessment of cardiac, hepatic and renal function 
should be undertaken before treatment and regularly during treatment. The disease may progress to 
myelofibrosis or AML. Although the rate of such progression is not known, children have a longer 
disease course and may, therefore, be at increased risk for malignant transformation, relative to adults. 
Children should be monitored regularly for disease progression according to standard clinical 
practices, such as physical examination, assessment of relevant disease markers and bone marrow 
biopsy. 
Any abnormalities should be evaluated promptly and appropriate measures taken, which may also 
include dose reduction, interruption or discontinuation. 
Clinically relevant interactions 
Anagrelide is an inhibitor of cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase III (PDE III). Concomitant use of 
anagrelide with other PDE III inhibitors such as milrinone, amrinone, enoximone, olprinone and 
cilostazol is not recommended. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Use of concomitant anagrelide and acetylsalicylic acid has been associated with major haemorrhagic 
events (see section 4.5). 
Excipients 
Anagrelide Viatris contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, 
the total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. 
Anagrelide Viatris contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’.  
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Limited pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic studies investigating possible interactions between 
anagrelide and other medicinal products have been conducted. 
Effects of other active substances on anagrelide 
In vivo  
Interaction studies in humans have demonstrated that digoxin and warfarin do not affect the 
pharmacokinetic properties of anagrelide. 
CYP1A2 inhibitors 
Anagrelide is primarily metabolised by CYP1A2. It is known that CYP1A2 is inhibited by several 
medicinal products, including fluvoxamine and enoxacin, and such medicinal products could 
theoretically adversely influence the clearance of anagrelide. 
CYP1A2 inducers 
CYP1A2 inducers (such as omeprazole) could decrease the exposure of anagrelide (see section 5.2). 
The consequences on the safety and efficacy profile of anagrelide are not established. Therefore, 
clinical and biological monitoring is recommended in patients taking concomitant CYP1A2 inducers. 
If needed, anagrelide dose adjustment could be made.    
Effects of anagrelide on other active substances 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Anagrelide demonstrates some limited inhibitory activity towards CYP1A2 which may present 
a theoretical potential for interaction with other co-administered medicinal products sharing that 
clearance mechanism, e.g., theophylline. 
Anagrelide is an inhibitor of PDE III. The effects of medicinal products with similar properties 
such as the inotropes milrinone, enoximone, amrinone, olprinone and cilostazol may be 
exacerbated by anagrelide. 
In vivo interaction studies in humans have demonstrated that anagrelide does not affect the 
pharmacokinetic properties of digoxin or warfarin. 
At the doses recommended for use in the treatment of ET, anagrelide may potentiate the effects 
of other medicinal products that inhibit or modify platelet function, e.g., acetylsalicylic acid. 
A clinical interaction study performed in healthy subjects showed that co-administration of 
repeat-dose anagrelide 1 mg once daily and acetylsalicylic acid 75 mg once daily may enhance 
the anti-platelet aggregation effects of each active substance compared with administration of 
acetylsalicylic acid alone. In some patients with ET concomitantly treated by acetylsalicylic 
acid and anagrelide, major haemorrhages occurred. Therefore, the potential risks of the 
concomitant use of anagrelide with acetylsalicylic acid should be assessed, particularly in 
patients with a high-risk profile for haemorrhage before treatment is initiated. 
Anagrelide may cause intestinal disturbance in some patients and compromise the absorption of 
hormonal oral contraceptives. 
Food interactions 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
Food delays the absorption of anagrelide, but does not significantly alter systemic exposure. 
The effects of food on bioavailability are not considered clinically relevant to the use of 
anagrelide. 
Paediatric population 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of child-bearing potential 
Women of child-bearing potential should use adequate birth-control measures during treatment with 
anagrelide. 
Pregnancy 
There are no adequate data from the use of anagrelide in pregnant women. Studies in animals have 
shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Therefore, 
anagrelide is not recommended during pregnancy. 
If anagrelide is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while using the medicinal 
product, she should be advised of the potential risk to the foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether anagrelide/metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available data in animals 
have shown excretion of anagrelide/metabolites in milk. A risk to the breast-fed newborn/infant cannot 
be excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with anagrelide. 
Fertility 
No human data on the effect of anagrelide on fertility are available. In male rats, there was no effect 
on fertility or reproductive performance with anagrelide. In female rats, using doses in excess of the 
therapeutic range, anagrelide disrupted implantation (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
In clinical development, dizziness was commonly reported. Patients are advised not to drive or operate 
machinery while taking anagrelide if dizziness is experienced. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The safety of anagrelide has been examined in 4 open label clinical studies. In 3 of the studies 
942 patients who received anagrelide at a mean dose of approximately 2 mg/day were assessed for 
safety.  
In these studies, 22 patients received anagrelide for up to 4 years. 
In the later study 3,660 patients who received anagrelide at a mean dose of approximately 2 mg/day 
were assessed for safety. In this study 34 patients received anagrelide for up to 5 years.

The most commonly reported adverse reactions associated with anagrelide were headache occurring at 
approximately 14%, palpitations occurring at approximately 9%, fluid retention and nausea both 
occurring at approximately 6% and diarrhoea occurring at 5%. These adverse drug reactions are 
expected based on the pharmacology of anagrelide (inhibition of PDE III). Gradual dose titration may 
help diminish these effects (see section 4.2).

Paediatric population 
48 patients aged 6 through17 years (19 children and 29 adolescents) have received anagrelide for up to 
6.5 years either in clinical studies or as part of a disease registry (see section 5.1). 
The majority of adverse reactions observed were among those listed in the SmPC. However, safety 
data are limited and do not allow a meaningful comparison between adult and paediatric patients to be 
made (see section 4.4). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Post-marketing case reports of intentional overdose with anagrelide have been received. Reported 
symptoms include sinus tachycardia and vomiting. Symptoms resolved with conservative 
management.

Anagrelide, at higher than recommended doses, has been shown to produce reductions in blood 
pressure with occasional instances of hypotension. A single 5-mg dose of anagrelide can lead to a fall 
in blood pressure usually accompanied by dizziness. 
A specific antidote for anagrelide has not been identified. In case of overdose, close clinical 
supervision of the patient is required; this includes monitoring of the platelet count for 
thrombocytopenia. Dose should be decreased or stopped, as appropriate, until the platelet count returns 
to within the normal range (see section 4.4). 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: L01XX35. 
Mechanism of action 
The precise mechanism by which anagrelide reduces blood platelet count is unknown. In cell culture 
studies, anagrelide suppressed expression of transcription factors including GATA-1 and FOG-1 
required for megakaryocytopoiesis, ultimately leading to reduced platelet production. 
In vitro studies of human megakaryocytopoiesis established that anagrelide’s inhibitory actions on 
platelet formation in man are mediated via retardation of maturation of megakaryocytes and reducing 
their size and ploidy. Evidence of similar in vivo actions was observed in bone marrow biopsy samples 
from treated patients. 
Anagrelide is an inhibitor of cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase III. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The safety and efficacy of anagrelide as a platelet lowering agent have been evaluated in four 
open-label, non-controlled clinical studies (study numbers 700-012, 700-014, 700-999 and 13970-301) 
including more than 4,000 patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). In patients with ET 
complete response was defined as a decrease in platelet count to ≤600 x 109/l or a ≥50% reduction 
from baseline and maintenance of the reduction for at least 4 weeks. In studies 700-012, 700-014, 700-
999 and study 13970-301 the time to complete response ranged from 4 to 12 weeks. Clinical benefit in 
terms of thrombohaemorrhagic events has not been convincingly demonstrated. 
Effects on heart rate and QTc interval 
The effect of two dose levels of anagrelide (0.5 mg and 2.5 mg single doses) on the heart rate and QTc 
interval was evaluated in a double-blind, randomised, placebo- and active-controlled, cross-over study 
in healthy adult men and women. 
A dose-related increase in heart rate was observed during the first 12 hours, with the maximum 
increase occurring around the time of maximal concentrations. The maximum change in mean heart 
rate occurred at 2 hours after administration and was +7.8 beats per minute (bpm) for 0.5 mg and 
+29.1 bpm for 2.5 mg. 
A transient increase in mean QTc was observed for both doses during periods of increasing heart rate 
and the maximum change in mean QTcF (Fridericia correction) was +5.0 msec occurring at 2 hours 
for 0.5 mg and +10.0 msec occurring at 1 hour for 2.5 mg. 
Paediatric population 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In an open-label clinical study in 8 children and 10 adolescents (including patients who were 
anagrelide treatment naïve or who had been receiving anagrelide for up to 5 years pre-study), median 
platelet counts were decreased to controlled levels after 12 weeks of treatment. The average daily dose 
tended to be higher in adolescents. 
In a paediatric registry study, median platelet counts were reduced from diagnosis and maintained for 
up to 18 months in 14 paediatric patients with ET (4 children, 10 adolescents) with anagrelide 
treatment. In earlier, open-label studies, median platelet count reductions were observed in 7 children 
and 9 adolescents treated for between 3 months and 6.5 years. 
The average total daily dose of anagrelide across all studies in paediatric patients with ET was highly 
variable, but overall the data suggest that adolescents could follow similar starting and maintenance 
doses to adults and that a lower starting dose of 0.5 mg/day would be more appropriate for children 
over 6 years (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.2). In all paediatric patients, careful titration to a 
patient-specific daily dose is needed. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Following oral administration of anagrelide in man, at least 70% is absorbed from the gastrointestinal 
tract. In fasted subjects, peak plasma levels occur about 1 hour after administration. Pharmacokinetic 
data from healthy subjects established that food decreases the Cmax of anagrelide by 14%, but increases 
the AUC by 20%. Food also decreased the Cmax of the active metabolite, 3-hydroxy anagrelide, by 
29%, although it had no effect on the AUC. 
Biotransformation 
Anagrelide is primarily metabolised by CYP1A2 to form, 3-hydroxy anagrelide, which is further 
metabolised via CYP1A2 to the inactive metabolite, 2-amino-5, 6-dichloro-3, 4-dihydroquinazoline. 
The effect of omeprazole, a CYP1A2 inducer, on the pharmacokinetics of anagrelide was investigated 
in 20 healthy adult subjects following multiple, once daily 40-mg doses. The results showed that in the 
presence of omeprazole, AUC(0-∞), AUC(0-t), and Cmax of anagrelide were reduced by 27%, 26%, and 
36%, respectively; and the corresponding values for 3-hydroxy anagrelide, a metabolite of anagrelide, 
were reduced by 13%, 14%, and 18%, respectively. 
Elimination 
The plasma half-life of anagrelide is short, approximately 1.3 hours and as expected from its half-life, 
there is no evidence for anagrelide accumulation in the plasma. Less than 1% is recovered in the urine 
as anagrelide. The mean recovery of 2-amino-5, 6-dichloro-3, 4-dihydroquinazoline in urine is 
approximately 18-35% of the administered dose. 
Additionally these results show no evidence of auto-induction of the anagrelide clearance. 
Linearity 
Dose proportionality has been found in the dose range 0.5 mg to 2 mg. 
Paediatric population 
Pharmacokinetic data from exposed fasting children and adolescents (age range 7 through 16 years) 
with ET indicate that dose normalised exposure, Cmax and AUC, of anagrelide tended to be higher in 
children/adolescents compared with adults. There was also a trend to higher dose-normalised exposure 
to the active metabolite. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elderly 
Pharmacokinetic data from fasting elderly patients with ET (age range 65 through 75 years) compared 
to fasting adult patients (age range 22 through 50 years) indicate that the Cmax and AUC of anagrelide 
were 36% and 61% higher respectively in elderly patients, but that the Cmax and AUC of the active 
metabolite, 3-hydroxy anagrelide, were 42% and 37% lower respectively in the elderly patients. These 
differences were likely to be caused by lower presystemic metabolism of anagrelide to 3-hydroxy 
anagrelide in the elderly patients. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Repeated dose toxicity 
Following repeated oral administration of anagrelide in dogs, subendocardial haemorrhage and focal 
myocardial necrosis was observed at 1 mg/kg/day or higher in males and females with males being 
more sensitive. The no observed effect level (NOEL) for male dogs (0.3 mg/kg/day) corresponds to 
0.1-, 0.1-, and 1.6-fold the AUC in humans for anagrelide at 2 mg/day, and the metabolites BCH24426 
and RL603, respectively. 
Reproductive toxicology 
Fertility 
In male rats, anagrelide at oral doses up to 240 mg/kg/day (>1,000 times a 2-mg/day dose, based on 
body surface area) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance. In female 
rats increases in pre- and post-implantation losses and a decrease in the mean number of live embryos 
was observed at 30 mg/kg/day. The NOEL (10 mg/kg/day) to this effect was 143-, 12- and 11-fold 
higher than the AUC in humans administered a dose of anagrelide 2 mg/day, and the metabolites 
BCH24426 and RL603, respectively. 
Embryofoetal development studies 
Maternally toxic doses of anagrelide in rats and rabbits were associated with increased embryo 
resorption and foetal mortality. 
In a pre- and post-natal development study in female rats, anagrelide at oral doses of ≥10 mg/kg 
produced a non-adverse increase in gestational duration. At the NOEL dose (3 mg/kg/day), the AUCs 
for anagrelide and the metabolites BCH24426 and RL603 were 14-, 2- and 2-fold higher than the 
AUC in humans administered an oral dose of anagrelide 2 mg/day. 
Anagrelide at ≥ 60 mg/kg increased parturition time and mortality in the dam and foetus, respectively. 
At the NOEL dose (30 mg/kg/day), the AUCs for anagrelide and the metabolites BCH24426 and 
RL603 were 425-, 31- and 13-fold higher than the AUC in humans administered an oral dose of 
anagrelide 2 mg/day, respectively. 
Mutagenic and carcinogenic potential 
Studies on the genotoxic potential of anagrelide did not identify any mutagenic or clastogenic effects. 
In a two-year rat carcinogenicity study, non-neoplastic and neoplastic findings were observed and 
related or attributed to an exaggerated pharmacological effect. Among them, the incidence of adrenal 
phaeochromocytomas was increased relative to control in males at all dose levels (≥3 mg/kg/day) and 
in females receiving 10 mg/kg/day and above. The lowest dose in males (3 mg/kg/day) corresponds to 
37 times the human AUC exposure after a 1 mg twice daily dose. Uterine adenocarcinomas, of 
epigenetic origin, could be related to an enzyme induction of CYP1 family. They were observed in 
females receiving 30 mg/kg/day, corresponding to 572 times the human AUC exposure after a 1-mg 
twice daily dose.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Anagrelide Viatris is and what it is used for 
Anagrelide Viatris contains the active substance, anagrelide. Anagrelide is a medicine which interferes 
with the development of platelets. It reduces the number of platelets produced by the bone marrow, 
which results in a decrease in the platelet count in the blood towards a more normal level. For this 
reason, it is used to treat patients with essential thrombocythaemia. 
Essential thrombocythaemia is a condition which occurs when the bone marrow produces too many of 
the blood cells known as platelets. Large numbers of platelets in the blood can cause serious problems 
with blood circulation and clotting. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Anagrelide Viatris 
• 
• 
• 
Do not take Anagrelide Viatris 
• 
If you are allergic to anagrelide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). An allergic reaction may be recognised as a rash, itching, swollen face or lips, or 
shortness of breath; 
If you have moderate or severe liver problems; 
If you have moderate or severe kidney problems. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking Anagrelide Viatris: 
• 
• 
If you have or think you might have a problem with your heart; 
If you were born with or have family history of prolonged QT interval (seen on ECG, electrical 
recording of the heart), or you are taking other medicines that result in abnormal ECG changes 
or if you have low levels of electrolytes, e.g., potassium, magnesium or calcium (see section 
“Other medicines and Anagrelide Viatris”); 
If you have any problems with your liver or kidneys. 
In combination with acetylsalicylic acid (a substance present in many medicines used to relieve pain 
and lower fever, as well as to prevent blood clotting, also known as aspirin), there is an increased risk 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of major haemorrhages (bleeding) (see section “Other medicines and Anagrelide Viatris”). 
While taking Anagrelide Viatris, you should take the exact dose prescribed by your doctor. Do not 
stop taking the medicine without first talking to your doctor. Do not abruptly stop taking this medicine 
without consulting your doctor. Abrupt withdrawal of medicine may lead to increased risk of stroke. 
Signs and symptoms of stroke may include sudden numbness or weakness in the face, arm, or leg, 
especially on one side of the body, sudden confusion, trouble speaking, or difficulty understanding 
speech, sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes, sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance, 
or lack of coordination and sudden severe headache with no known cause.  Please seek immediate 
medical help. 
Children and adolescents 
There is limited information on the use of anagrelide in children and adolescents and therefore this 
medicine should be used with caution. 
Other medicines and Anagrelide Viatris 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Medicines that can alter your heart rhythm, e.g., sotalol, amiodarone; 
Fluvoxamine, used to treat depression; 
Certain types of antibiotic, such as enoxacin, used to treat infections; 
Theophylline, used to treat severe asthma and breathing problems; 
Medicines used to treat heart disorders, for example, milrinone, enoximone, amrinone, 
olprinone and cilostazol; 
Acetylsalicylic acid (a substance present in many medicines used to relieve pain and lower 
fever, as well as to prevent blood clotting, also known as aspirin); 
Other medicines used to treat conditions affecting the platelets in your blood, e.g., clopidogrel; 
Omeprazole, used to reduce the amount of acid produced in the stomach; 
Oral contraceptives: If you experience bad diarrhoea whilst taking this medicine, it may reduce 
how well the oral contraceptive works and use of an extra method of contraception is 
recommended (e.g., condom). See the instructions in the patient leaflet of the contraceptive pill 
you are taking. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Anagrelide or these medicines may not work properly if taken together. 
If you are not sure, speak to your doctor or pharmacist for advice. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or are planning to become pregnant. Anagrelide Viatris should not 
be taken by pregnant women. Women who are at risk of becoming pregnant should make sure that 
they are using effective contraception when taking anagrelide. Speak to your doctor if you need advice 
with contraception. 
Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or if you are planning to breast-feed your baby. Anagrelide 
Viatris should not be taken while breast-feeding. You must stop breast-feeding if you are taking 
Anagrelide Viatris. 
Driving and using machines 
Dizziness has been reported by some patients taking anagrelide. Do not drive or use machines if you 
feel dizzy. 
Anagrelide Viatris contains lactose and sodium 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This medicine contains lactose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to 
some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
3.  How to take Anagrelide Viatris 
Always take Anagrelide Viatris exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or 
pharmacist if you are not sure. 
The amount of anagrelide that people take can be different, and this depends on your condition. Your 
doctor will prescribe the best dose for you. 
The usual starting dose of this medicine is 1 mg. You take this dose as one capsule of 0.5 mg twice a 
day, for at least a week. After this time, your doctor may either increase or decrease the number of 
capsules that you take to find the dose best suited to you and which treats your condition most 
effectively. 
Your capsules should be swallowed whole with a glass of water. Do not crush the capsules or dilute 
the contents in a liquid. You can take the capsules with food or after a meal or on an empty stomach. It 
is best to take the capsule(s) at the same time every day. 
Do not take more or less capsules than your doctor has recommended. Do not stop taking the 
medicine without first talking to your doctor. You should not suddenly stop taking this medicine on 
your own. 
Your doctor will ask you to have blood tests at regular intervals to check that your medicine is 
working effectively and that your liver and kidneys are working well. 
If you take more Anagrelide Viatris than you should 
If you take more Anagrelide Viatris than you should or if someone else has taken your medicine, tell a 
doctor or pharmacist immediately. Show them the pack of Anagrelide Viatris. 
If you forget to take Anagrelide Viatris 
Take your capsules as soon as you remember. Take your next dose at the usual time. Do not take a 
double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1. 
What Anagrelide Viatris is and what it is used for 
Anagrelide Viatris contains the active substance, anagrelide. Anagrelide is a medicine which interferes 
with the development of platelets. It reduces the number of platelets produced by the bone marrow, 
which results in a decrease in the platelet count in the blood towards a more normal level. For this 
reason, it is used to treat patients with essential thrombocythaemia. 
Essential thrombocythaemia is a condition which occurs when the bone marrow produces too many of 
the blood cells known as platelets. Large numbers of platelets in the blood can cause serious problems 
with blood circulation and clotting. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Anagrelide Viatris 
• 
• 
• 
Do not take Anagrelide Viatris 
• 
If you are allergic to anagrelide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). An allergic reaction may be recognised as a rash, itching, swollen face or lips, or 
shortness of breath; 
If you have moderate or severe liver problems; 
If you have moderate or severe kidney problems. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking Anagrelide Viatris: 
• 
• 
If you have or think you might have a problem with your heart; 
If you were born with or have family history of prolonged QT interval (seen on ECG, electrical 
recording of the heart), or you are taking other medicines that result in abnormal ECG changes 
or if you have low levels of electrolytes, e.g., potassium, magnesium or calcium (see section 
“Other medicines and Anagrelide Viatris”); 
If you have any problems with your liver or kidneys. 
In combination with acetylsalicylic acid (a substance present in many medicines used to relieve pain 
and lower fever, as well as to prevent blood clotting, also known as aspirin), there is an increased risk 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of major haemorrhages (bleeding) (see section “Other medicines and Anagrelide Viatris”). 
While taking Anagrelide Viatris, you should take the exact dose prescribed by your doctor. Do not 
stop taking the medicine without first talking to your doctor. Do not abruptly stop taking this medicine 
without consulting your doctor. Abrupt withdrawal of medicine may lead to increased risk of stroke.

especially on one side of the body, sudden confusion, trouble speaking, or difficulty understanding 
speech, sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes, sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance, 
or lack of coordination and sudden severe headache with no known cause.  Please seek immediate 
medical help. 
Children and adolescents 
There is limited information on the use of anagrelide in children and adolescents and therefore this 
medicine should be used with caution.

Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or are planning to become pregnant. Anagrelide Viatris should not 
be taken by pregnant women. Women who are at risk of becoming pregnant should make sure that 
they are using effective contraception when taking anagrelide. Speak to your doctor if you need advice

32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This medicine contains lactose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to 
some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. 
This medicine contains less than 1mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially

3.  How to take Anagrelide Viatris 
Always take Anagrelide Viatris exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or 
pharmacist if you are not sure. 
The amount of anagrelide that people take can be different, and this depends on your condition. Your 
doctor will prescribe the best dose for you. 
The usual starting dose of anagrelide is 1 mg. You take this dose as one capsule of 0.5 mg twice a day, 
for at least a week. After this time, your doctor may either increase or decrease the number of capsules 
that you take to find the dose best suited to you and which treats your condition most effectively. 
Your capsules should be swallowed whole with a glass of water. Do not crush the capsules or dilute 
the contents in a liquid. You can take the capsules with food or after a meal or on an empty stomach. It 
is best to take the capsule(s) at the same time every day. 
Do not take more or less capsules than your doctor has recommended. Do not stop taking the 
medicine without first talking to your doctor. You should not suddenly stop taking this medicine on 
your own. 
Your doctor will ask you to have blood tests at regular intervals to check that your medicine is 
working effectively and that your liver and kidneys are working well. 
If you take more Anagrelide Viatris than you should 
If you take more Anagrelide Viatris than you should or if someone else has taken your medicine, tell a 
doctor or pharmacist immediately. Show them the pack of Anagrelide Viatris. 
If you forget to take Anagrelide Viatris 
Take your capsules as soon as you remember. Take your next dose at the usual time. Do not take a 
double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.

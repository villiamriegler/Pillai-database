pressure and ventricular ectopic activity for dobutamine, or 
decrease in blood pressure for adenosine and dipyridamole)

The integrated clinical trial database for SonoVue, from 
Package Leaflet. 
The MAH has applied to amend section 4.8 of the 
SPC in order to be in line with the Company Core 
Data Sheet (September 2009). The Package Leaflet 
has been updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH 
took the opportunity to update Annex II in line with 
the standard DDPS wording and to reflect the latest 
RMP version agreed with the CHMP.

of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data

which the adverse events table in the new SPC is derived, 
contains 58 studies (8 healthy volunteer studies, 13 cardiac 
studies, 9 macrovasculature studies (i.e., Doppler 
sonography studies of arteries), 25 microvasculature 
studies (i.e., Doppler sonography studies of tissue 
microcirculation), and 3 special population studies). The 
database includes a total of 4653 subjects of whom 128 
were healthy volunteers and 38 were special population 
patients. Safety data from myocardial perfusion studies (a 
total of 423 patients) were excluded from analysis since 
this indication is not approved in Europe. The MAH has 
applied to amend section 4.8 of the SPC in order to be in 
line with the Company Core Data Sheet (September 2009).
